Doctoral hooding receieves review
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan News Editor
This springs commencement may 
feature more changes if current plans 
to establish a new doctoral hooding 
ceremony are accepted. Doctoral hood
ing has been under review since last 
year when commencement as a whole 
was reviewed. A recomendation, which 
has been requested by Provost Paul 
Christiano, is being prepared by a 
small task force that will review the 
current ceremony and make recom
mendations on how to structure a sepa
rate ceremony. _________________
will take its recommendation and make 
a final decision on whether or not to 
change commencement.
Having been to many of the CMU 
commencements in the past 10 years, 
the hooding ceremony is basically a big 
restroom break for parents of graduat
ing seniors who quickly realize that 30- 
35 minutes are going to elapse before 
the next part of commencement starts, 
said Scott Matthews, a doctoral stu
dent in industrial management. You 
see a lot of people getting up, most 
others politely applauding. A separate 
ceremony would suffer from less of the
Last years comu. ..

Dean of Student
Affairs Michael
Murphy. There
wasnt agreement
last year on what
to do about doctoral hooding.
The hooding ceremony currently in
volves having each recipient of a doc
toral degree walk across stage and have 
their hood placed on them by a member 
of the University. Each year, more 
than 200 students receive doctorates. 
Not all attend the ceremony, but it is 
designed to accomodate all of them in 
30 to 45 minutes.
This years task force is made up of 
students and administrators. Christiano

former, little of the latter. So any plan 
or proposal that gives more meaningful 
attention to earning a doctorate is bet
ter in my opinion.
Not all doctoral students are in favor 
of the changes. Grant Bromhal, presi
dent of the Graduate Student Assem
bly, has been trying to collect input 
from graduate students. He estimated 
that about 60 to 65 percent of the people 
who responded to him were opposed to 
the changes.
Urited Way looks for 
greater participation
I think that there is a significant num
ber of students who dont like the idea at 
all, said Bromhal. My personal opinion 
is one of ambivalence. I see that a separate 
ceremony could be a nice addition to gradu
ation, but at the same time, it is sort of a 
marginalization of doctoral students. I 
think the thing that motivated the move is 
the time issue, but if that was the only 
reason, it wouldnt be moved.
I think that there is concern about what 
the new ceremony will look like, said 
Murphy. Most people are skeptical until 
there is an actual proposal on the table. 
Bromhal indicated that last year when

Matthews said that the administration 
has been recieving feedback about the 
length of commencement.
Christiano said that the separate cer

details of the ceremony have not been 
worked out.
The decision has been made in general  
that is we will create a separate ceremony to

As tb temperature drops in Pitts
burgh, he University community will 
be askd to make the mercury rise on 
a specfic thermometer on campus. 
This siecific thermometer will mea
sure onations to the United Ways 
annuii campagn and will sit in its 
usualplace outside of Warner Hall.
Thf United Way serves as an umbrell; organization for a number of 
charties in the area and streamlines 
fund'aising resources to make them 
morj effective. The annual campaign 
on cimpus to raise money for the areas 
charitable organizations will begin 
Morday October 5, with the hope that 
last years level of donations can be 
met and even topped.
liot-for-profit agencies are increas
ingly called upon to provide key social 
services for the needy, ranging from 
food pantries, to shelters for the home
less and the abused, to programs for 
young children, said Dean of the Heinz 
School Mark Kamlet, coordinator of 
the campaign. How are they to raise 
their resources? One way would be by 
conducting hundreds of independent 
furdraising campaigns.... Or, they can 
coordinate their efforts under a short, 
systematic campaign such as the 
United Way.
President Cohon voiced his support 
for'the campaign and cited it as one 
more opportunity for Carnegie Mellon 
to demonstrate its commitment to im
proving the quality of life in the greater
little bit, but it can go a long way in a food 
bank or shelter.
The campaign will target faculty and 
staff for donations. Pledge forms, return 
envelopes, and informational brochures 
will be distributed to faculty and staff 
through campus mail. Donations can be 
made through paycheck deductions, and 
cans will be located around campus for 
donations.
The difficulty in this years campaign, 
as with every years campaign, is getting 
peoples attention.
Generally, the Carnegie Mellon com
munity has been very generous in con
tributing to the regions neediest citi
zens, said Kamlet. People at Carnegie 
Mellon are very busy.... Trying to get on 
their radar screen for a short moment 
each year to focus on this cause is one of 
the key challenges we face.
This year, the Staff Council President 
Denise Murrin-Macey brought up the 
campaign at a weekly Staff Council 
meeting.
Its not necessarily how much you 
have to contribute but that you give 
some, said Murrin-Macey. If everyone 
gave [some] that would be great. 
Murrin-Macey also.stressed the donor 
choice program, which allows people to 
direct where their money goes. Under 
the program an individuals can decide 
which organizations they would like to 
recieve their contributions.
Students are one of the groups on 
campus that are not targeted for dona
tions, but any help that they give, from 
volunteering for the campaign to giving 
donations themselves, is more than wel
come, according to Kamlet.
The campus-wide campaign will run 
from October 5 until October 16, but 
donations to the United Way will be 
accepted at any time.
OUR r^nAi
Pijtsburgh area.
Last year Carnegie Mellon was able 
tojraise $140,000 in its United Way 
campaign. That represented a rise in 
donations of $20,000 over the previ
ous year and 40percent since 1995.
(Jarnegie Mellon also led the area 
in leadership giving, which is de
fined as an individual donation of 
$1,000 or more.
There are two goals to the cam
paign this year, said Kamlet.
One goal is the total amount of 
funds raised on campus for 
United Way. We would like to 
keep our level of giving at last 
years level or even higher and 
maintain our number of leader
ship donors.
The University has lagged in 
overall participation on the cam
paign though. Last year, between 
10 percent and 20 percent of the 
University participated in the cam
paign, and only six of the 56 units 
used to measure participation 
topped 25 percent.
Our second and equally impor
tant goal is participation, said 
Kamlet. We would like to spread 
word about the United Way and to 
urge people to give, even if the
amount they can afford to give is Tartan File Photo
low. $5 and $10 may sound like a United Way fundraising will start October 5.
CMU course works with mayors office to improve bike paths
By SRIRAM GOLLAPALLI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Would you like to be a part of 
working on a bike path from 
Washington, D.C. to Indiana? 
Professor Joel Tarr and his His
tory & Policy Project course are 
taking p art in history by enhanc
ing the bike trails and paths in 
the Pittsburgh area with more 
historical and cultural informa
tion.
Tarr and his students are work
ing with Pittsburgh mayor Tom 
Murphys office and the Steel In
dustry Heritage Corporation on 
the project. Murphy has been
looking for ways to bring more 
permanent residents into the 
Pittsburgh area following years 
of decline in population. The trails 
are one way of attracting new 
residents and tourists.
The goal of the course is to tell 
the bikers, joggers, and walkers 
more about the trails that they 
are using, but in addition to the 
local work being done here at 
CMU, the bike trails may be 
joined with other trails from 
Maryland to Indiana.
This is a capstone course for a 
history and public policy major, 
said Tarr. We use history to deal 
with problems or questions around
this area. We want to attract 
people into this city  both tour
ists and visitors  by improving 
the quality of life and providing 
sustainable development.
Currently, there are a number 
of separate biking and walking 
trails across the city. They in
clude the Allegheny River trail 
network and the confluence trail 
to the Ohio Pyle river.
The class has been divided into 
two teams. One works on the in
dustry and work-related trails, 
and the other focuses on the cul
tural aspects of the trails.
The class will be compiling 
historical material that will be
useful and understandable to 
visitors, as well as photographs, 
a presence on the Web, and an 
oral/written report. At the end 
of the semester, the class will be 
presenting a report to the 
mayors office.
Tarr is working with Vagel 
Keller, a history and policy gradu
ate student who is acting as the 
project manager, and organizes 
the students, but leaves the work 
to them.
They are given full responsi
bility for the success of the 
project, said Tarr. Fenton is pri
marily working on the 
Lawrenceville area.
The Steel Industry Heritage 
Corporation would like to focus 
on the history of the steel indus
try in the area. The Mayors office 
would like to see the descriptions 
add new meanings to the trails 
and encourage more people to 
use them.
The class is primarily working 
on two different trails. The first 
is the Steel Industry Heritage 
Trail, which covers different in
dustrial and transportation sites 
in the Monongahela Valley. The 
second is the Three Rivers Heri
tage Trail, which focuses on the 
more religious and culturally sig
nificant sites.
Most people do not know much 
about the area they are in but 
would like to learn more, said 
Tarr. We hope to increase the 
historical references here, and 
we will give more meaning to the 
area. We would also like to es
tablish this region as one of the 
critical sites of the French and 
Indian War.
It is something focused entirely 
on Pittsburgh, which a lot of 
classes dont do, said senior his
tory major Allyson Fenton, who 
is enrolled in the course. The 
mayor is really interested in see
ing this project go through and is 
providing support for it.

M
O/iCongress wrangles 
possible impeacheme
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House 
. Judiciary Committee plans to contact 
. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
1 to ask whether he has turned up evi
dence of impeachable offenses beyond 
J President Clintons affair with Monica 
Lewinsky, officials said Friday.
The disclosure came as freshly re
leased evidence was disclosed that it 
was an anonymous phone call from 
Linda Tripp to Starrs office one night 
last January that triggered the inves
tigation that now threatens 
the president.
 Tripp at first refused to provide her 
name, but Starrs deputies returned 
Iher call by prior arrangement a short 
while later, according to the records. 
iTripp proceeded to tell her story at 
length  a tale involving Clinton, 
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, Paula 
Jones, presidential secretary Betty 
ICurrie, and others whose actions form 
ithe basis of the impeachment drama 
now unfolding.
.. Starr has alleged 11 instances of possi
bly impeachable offenses resulting from 
^Clintons affair with Lewinsky and ef
forts to conceal it, and the Judiciary 
Committee meets on Monday to vote on 
 beginning a formal impeachment inquiry. 
i Republican sources, speaking on con
dition of anonymity, said that at 
^Mondays meeting the Republicans top 
lawyer, David Schippers, would recom>mend adding to Starrs list of potentially 
impeachable offenses and dropping one 
'of the 11 grounds that Starr cited.
Schippers, the sources said, is ex
pected to suggest dropping a count in 
which Starr claimed Clinton abused 
his office by unlawfully invoking ex
ecutive privilege to conceal evidence of 
-his misconduct before the grand jury. 
It is unclear what the practical effect 
! will be of Schippers presentation, since 
the committee is voting this week only 
on launching a formal investigation.
Republicans are advocating an openended investigation without limits on
er 
nt
rtaintoits scope or duration and are 
prevail when the roll is call& in the 
committee and later in the reek on 
the floor of the House.
Congressional officials, spekingon 
condition of anonymity, sai< that a 
letter, that RepresentativesHenry 
Hyde, (R-Ill.), and John Conjrs, (DMich.), intend to send Starr vill ask 
whether or not the independei; coun
sel intends to make any add.ional 
reports to Congress detailing Allega
tions of possibly impeachable otenses.
Hyde is chairman of the Juiciary 
Committee and Conyers 
senior Democrat.
A bipartisan group of four commit
tee members urged Hyde and Coiyers 
earlier in the week to contact (tarr, 
but Hyde initially turned asicfc the 
request. Republican sources citel his 
turnabout as fresh evidence that lyde 
is working hard to show bipartisan
ship to Democrats.
There was no immediate resp 
from Starrs office. The decision to s\nd 
Starr a letter aside, Republicans frid 
Democrats clashed sharply di 
day ina partisan prelude to next wejks 
House vote. Without limits on the oinended investigation envisioned by jlepublicans, charged Conyers, this 
ceeding could turn into a year-long, tivo 
years, politicized fishing expeditior^of 
enormous expense.
Conyers unveiled an alternative tlkt 
would limit any inquiry to matters 
relating to Clintons relationship with 
Lewinsky. It also calls for wrapping 
up the entire matter by November 25. 
The proposal envisions alternative 
sanctions to impeachment, presum
ably including censure.
Hyde added in a written statement 
that many of the same provisions 
Democrats are now advocating wire 
specifically and steadfastly rejec 
by Chairman [James] Rodino, Jc 
Conyers and the rest of the Democrats 
during the Watergate inquiry."
Hole in protective 
layer grows large
GENEVA (AP)  The ozone hole 
over Antarctica grew to its largest size 
ever in September, covering an area 
two-and-a-half times the size of Eu
rope, the World Meteorological Organi
zation (WMO) said Thursday.
Scientists expect the hole in the ozone
 the protective layer that shields the 
earth from damaging ultraviolet rays  
to grow each September because of tem
perature fluctuations.
Ozone, a gas in the stratosphere, pro
tects Earth from harmful UV radiation. 
Its depletion, thought to be caused by 
man-made chemicals used in aerosols 
and refrigeration, is believed to expose 
humans and animals to increased risks 
of skin cancer and cataracts. Last month, 
it grew by more than 15 percent, expos
ing not only Antarctica but a huge swath 
of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, in
cluding the southern tip of South 
America, to harmful ultraviolet rays, 
WMO official Rumen Bojkov told a news 
conference Thursday.
Because of temperature changes, ozone 
levels are expected to improve between 
now and the end of the year or early next 
year, Bojkov said. Still, he said, the ozone 
layer depletion in September was very, 
very serious. He said the ozone reduc
tion was more severe than in previous 
years because a whirlpool-like atmo
spheric phenomenon that develops each 
year above the South Pole  the polar 
vortex  was larger than usual.
The polar vortex is a moving cyclone 
with a low-pressure, cold center in which 
ozone is less likely to be present.
An additional cause of ozone depletion 
is the chlorine and bromine released by 
man-made chemical compounds such as 
chlorofluorocarbons that are contained 
in some aerosol sprays.
Pentagon spends 
money on Viagra
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Pentagon 
estimates it will spend around $50 million 
in the coming year to provide the impo
tence drug Viagra to American troops and 
military retirees.
The cost  roughly the price of two 
new Marine Corps Harrier jets or 45 
Tomahawk cruise missiles  is among 
the unexpected military expenses that 
Pentagon officials recently told Congress 
have come up since they made their 
original 1999 budget requests. Viagra 
sort of burst on the scene, Pentagon 
spokesman Jim Turner said Friday.
Based on the number of soldiers, sail
ors, pilots, Marines, and retirees asking 
for Viagra so far at military clinics and 
hospitals, Defense Department health 
officials estimated that if the drug were 
given to everyone who wanted it, the 
cost could top $100 million.
But the military is limiting Viagra to 
men diagnosed with erectile dysfunction 
by a doctor. Also, no one is allowed more 
than six pills a month, and according to a 
written Pentagon policy,  lost, stolen, or 
destroyed tablets will not be replaced. 
Viagra costs $8 to $10 a pill. At that 
rate, the Pentagons estimate of spend
ing $50 million would pay for 5 million to 
6 million of the pills.
The Pentagon provides health care to 
about 1.2 million troops and 5 million 
dependents and retirees. Since Viagra 
was authorized for sale in the United 
States in March, the drug has been pre
scribed to more than 4 million American 
men, according to its maker, New Yorkbased Pfizer Inc.
The militarys projected Viagra ex
penses were first reported by Cox 
News Service.
Judge sentences 
man for cheating
NEW YORK (AP) - A man accused 
of organizing a scheme that helped more 
than 500 students cheat on graduate 
school admissions tests has been sen
tenced to four years in prison.
Fm very sorry for what I did,Po Chieng 
Ma said as he struggled to keep his compo
sure, finally breaking into tears and drop
ping his head onto the defense table at the 
end of Fridays proceeding. Ive deprived 
my three kids of living with their father. 
The rest of my life, I will never do 
anything illegal again, he told U.S. Dis
trict Judge John S. Martin. The judge, 
calling the case extraordinary, said he 
was impressed by Mas sincerity.
He ordered Ma to serve four years in 
prison, rejecting Assistant U.S. Attor
ney Mark A. Godse/s argument for a 
stiffer sentence.
Ma, a citizen of Taiwan who holds 
Canadian residency, has been in prison 
since he was caught attempting to flee to 
Canada on January 9. He pleaded guilty 
to reduced charges.
Ma, also known as George 
Kobayashi, was accused of organizing 
the test-cheating scheme for nearly 
every test date between June 1993 and 
October: 1996 for the Graduate Man
agement Admissions Test, Graduate 
Record Exam, and Test of English as a 
Foreign Language.
Ma allegedly paid experts to take the 
tests under assumed names in New York. 
They then phoned the correct answers to 
Los Angeles, where they were inscribed 
in code on pencils and where the same 
tests began three hours later because of 
the time difference.
The pencils were issued to students, 
some of whom prosecutors said were in
structed to fly to Los Angeles forthe tests.
Child finds new 
type of dinosaur
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -An 8- 
year-old boy has the distinction of hav
ing a dinosaur named after him. And not 
just any dinosaur.'
The creature  dubbed Zuniceratops 
christopheri  is believed to be the old
est homed dinosaur ever found, some 90 
million years old.
The first of its fossils was discovered 
November 11, 1996, in New Mexico by 
Christopher Wolfe of Phoenix and his 
dad, paleontologist Doug Wolfe. Chris 
found the first piece. With Thursdays 
publication of a paper in the bulletin of 
the New Mexico Museum of Natural 
History, the name became official.
Jim Kirkland, a paleontologist from 
Fruita, Colo., theorizes the three-horned 
Zuniceratops was 10 to 12 feet long, 
maybe 500 pounds, and lived 90 million 
to 92 million years ago.
Christopher is sure he will be a pale
ontologist like his dad. Most likely Ill 
be doing it in space, he said. Ill be 
going to other planets and seeing if they 
have fossils.
British, French support proposals made by U.S. to reform IMF
; WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton got support for his 
efforts to reform the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) from Brit
ish Prime Minister Tony Blair 
ajid French President Jacques 
Cjhirac, the White House said. 
The endorsements came as lead
ers of the worlds largest econo
mies gathered for pivotal eco
nomic meetings.
Presidential spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said Clinton, in calls to 
both Blair and Chirac, received 
a positive response to a package 
of proposals he put forward Friday 
to halt a widening financial crisis 
before it worsens into a global 
depression.
The administrations top eco
nomic officials  Treasury Sec
retary Robert Rubin, Gene 
Sperling, head of the National
Economic Council, and Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence 
Summers  briefed the Presi
dent on what Lockhart said were 
positive responses they were re
ceiving from other countries to 
the U.S. ideas.
Clinton, speaking Friday at the 
White House, urged the IMF to 
change its procedures to provide 
emergency loans more quickly to 
countries facing economic diffi
culties. He hoped substantial sup
port early on would avert the 
types of market meltdowns that 
many Asian nations and Russia 
have experienced.
Rubin and Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan were 
scheduled to lobby for the propos
als at meetings later today with 
their counterparts from the 
worlds seven richest countries
 the United States, Japan, Brit
ain, France, Germany, Canada, 
and Italy.
British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer 'Gordon Brown and Ca
nadian Finance Minister Paul 
Martin, speaking to reporters in 
advance of those talks, gave gen
eral endorsement today to the 
U.S. package while saying that 
these proposals were among a 
number that should be consid
ered. As we meet here in Wash
ington, we are conscious that 
more than a quarter of the world 
is in recession, that the second 
largest economy in the world, 
Japan, is in recession, and that 
the social casualties of the Asian 
crisis are rising in numbers, 
Brown told reporters.
The talks by the Group of Seven 
nations at the historic Blair House
across the street from the White 
House were setting the stage for 
wider discussions at the annual 
meetings of the 182-nation IMF 
and World Bank which get under 
way Sunday.
In advance of the G-7 discus
sions, Rubin met separately with 
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa for what he told report
ers would be a useful and con
structive response of the prob
lems facing the world economy.
Rubin told reporters on Friday 
that the United States still be
lieved that aggressive actions on 
the part of Japanese authorities 
to deal with weak banks and 
jump-start its economy were key 
to resolving the crisis that began 
in Thailand 15 months ago.
Critics have attacked the IMF 
for pursing programs that so far
have failed to contain the conta
gion that now threatens Latin 
America. The IMF provided 
more than $100 billion in bailout 
funds for Thailand, South Korea, 
and Russia.
Rubin met Friday with Bra
zilian Finance Minister Pedro 
Malan, who has confirmed re
ports that Brazil is negotiating 
for a multibillion-dollar loan 
package from the IMF, the World 
Bank, and private creditors.
There are expectations a pack
age of $30 billion could be an
nounced after Sundays presiden
tial election in Brazil as the United 
States works with the IMF to keep 
the largest economy in Latin 
America from becoming the latest 
victim of the Asian crisis.
Rubin told reporters that the 
United States would be pushing
a number of proposals to the fi
nance ministers, but aides cau
tioned that some of the efforts 
were still in the preliminary stage 
and not likely to be approved 
during the IMF annual meetings. 
This country has got to lead, 
Clinton said. Weve got to be 
aggressive. Weve got to stay on 
the balls of our feet.
He scolded Congress for what 
he called the inexcusable delay 
in approvingthe administrations 
request for $18 billion to replen
ish the IMFs depleted coffers.
Clinton said he would partici
pate in discussions that Rubin 
and Greenspan will hold Monday 
with finance officials from 22 
nations, both rich and develop
ing countries, that will be held on 
the fringes of the IMF-World 
Bank sessions.

CMU changes 
dental insurer
United Concordia Companies, 
Inc., a subsidiary of Highmark 
Blue CrossBlue Shield, will re
place Prudential as CMUs 
FlexPlus dental program insurer. 
The change will be effective Janu
ary 1,1999. Seven out of 10 den
tists in Western Pennsylvania 
participate in United Concordias 
provider network.
This change will help our em
ployees and their families have 
access to high-quality dental care 
and a high level of customer ser
vice iiya cost-effective manner, 
said Earl McKinley, CMUs man
ager of benefits. Participants 
electing Concordia Preferred, 
which will replace the current 
Enhanced Dental program, will 
enjoy more flexibility in choosing, 
dental providers, a higher level of 
benefits, and most likely lower 
out-of-pocket cost.
Monthly employee contribution 
rates for the new plans are the 
same or lower than current rates, 
depending on the plan selected.

HOODING, from page 1
do a better job in the hooding cer
emony and shorten the main cer
emony, said Christiano. Nothing 
has been determined for how the 
ceremony will be conducted!., 1 
Christiano cited two motivat
ing factors for changing the cer
emony. The first is that d^dtoral 
students and their family seem to 
appreciate the ceremony more 
than undergraduate degree 're
cipients. The second is that since 
graduation will no longer be un
der a tent and will instead take 
place in Gesling Stadium, 
inclimate Weather will effectively 
cancel the ceremony. Undergraduates wjll still have their depart
mental, ceremony in the case of 
rain, but there is no backup for 
doctoral students.
Bromhal, who is on the task 
force, also doubts that there will 
be a solution that will please ev
eryone. He said that some people 
would be upset no matter what, 
but that it would take a large 
response from students to pre
vent the separate ceremony from 
being implemented.
I do honestly feel that Presi
dent Cohon and the administra
tion are trying to make some
thing better in the end, said 
Matthews. It is clear that having a separate ceremony will cost!;; 
a great deal in time and effort; as* 
well as financial cost.
Currently the options beingTex-v 
amined include a ceremonyon* 
the Saturday preceding com-- 
mencement a hooding ceremonythat would involve thesis advisors, a separate speaker, and a - 
reception afterwards.
The Graduate Student Assembly has addressed the issue in its 
meetings, and also has it listed on  
the agenda for this weeks meeting. In the meantime, the task 1 
force will continue to work on a * 
proposal that it hopes to complete  
before the end of the month.

Crime and Incident Report
9/24 THEFT, 11:00 pm - A 
CPS supervisor contacted Cam
pus Police to report a theft. The 
dispatched officer went to Wean 
Hall to meet the supervisor and 
an employee. The employee said 
that last night while she was 
cleaning Wean Hall, she placed 
her gray Sanitare sweeper inside 
the custodial closet. She said that 
she left the door shut but un
locked, as she does every night. 
When she returned to the closet 
at four in the morning, she found 
the sweeper missing. The sweeper 
was valued at $180.
9/26 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
3:46 am  A security guard radi
oed Campus Police, saying that 
he had observed a pair of males 
remove a No Parking sign from 
the entrance to Roselawn Ter
race and that they were now run
ning towards Resnik Hall. As of
ficers responded, the guard again 
radioed the police, saying that 
the actors were now running 
across the football field towards 
Tech Garage.
One officer was dropped off in 
the University Center parking 
lot and another headed towards 
the Beeler Street entrance to the 
garage, in case the actors split
up. The officer who was dropped 
off saw the actors running across 
the field towards the west end of 
the stadium. The officer shouted, 
Police! Stop! twice, but neither 
actor complied. The officer was 
able to catch one of the actors 
near the west steps. He forced 
the actor to face the bleachers 
and told him not to move. The 
officer then radioed that the other 
actor had removed his white tshirt and was running towards 
Forbes Avenue.
The officer asked the actor his 
name, but he would not respond. 
The officer asked if he was a 
CMU student, but the actor 
would not respond to that ques
tion either. The officer placed 
the actor in handcuffs for both 
his and the actors safety. He 
then walked the actor to the main 
entrance of Tech Garage where 
they met up with the other offic
ers who had responded to the 
call. They had had no luck in 
finding the other actor.
The officer then conducted a 
search of the detained actors per
son and found an empty flask, a 
set of keys, and a wallet. He was 
identified as a CMU student and 
a member of a fraternity. The 
actor was very uncooperative and
was intoxicated. The officer asked 
him why he did not stop when he 
had shouted, Police! Stop! The 
actor said that he did not know 
that the men chasing him were 
police officers. Otherwise, he 
claimed, he would have stopped. 
The officer asked him who the 
actor who had eluded the officers 
was. The actor said that he had 
never met the man. The actor 
was issued an internal citation 
for failure to comply with the 
police. Since the actor was of al
cohol-consuming age, no further 
action was taken, and the actor 
was released.
9/29 DISPUTE, 2:16 am - A 
Central Properties Services cus
todian was mopping the second 
floor of 4902 Forbes Avenue, com
monly known as the Student Cen
ter, when a male entered the hall
way. The male began to walk on 
the mopped portion of the hall
way, so the custodian stopped 
him, suggesting that he use a 
different hall to exit the building. 
At this, the male became agi
tated, saying that he paid to at
tend this school and that he could 
walk anywhere he pleased. He 
also said that since this particu
lar hallway was the fastest way
for him to go, he was going to use 
it. He continued by insulting the 
custodian, saying that no janitor, 
especially a janitor whose wages 
he paid, was going to tell him 
where to walk.
The custodian felt the male 
was giving him a harder time 
than he deserved, so he contacted 
Campus Police to file a report. 
An officer went to talk to the 
offending student, who was 
working in the basement of4902 
Forbes. He said that the custo
dian was rude to him by telling 
him where he could and could 
not walk. He also said that the 
custodian called him several ob
scene names.
The officer asked the custodian 
if he had called the student those 
names. He denied it, however, and 
said that he had contacted his 
supervisors and that they would 
write a report on the incident.
9/29 MEDICAL, 6:22 am - A 
fraternity member called Cam
pus Police to report that one of 
his brothers had a dislocated 
shoulder. CMU EMS, two offic
ers, and a city medic responded 
to the fraternity. The injured 
brother was sitting on the floor 
and appeared to be in severe
pain. There was an obvious de
formity to his left shoulder. The 
victim said that he woke up at 5 
am and realized that he had 
somehow dislocated his shoul
der in his sleep. The medic im
mobilized the shoulder and 
transported him to UPMC.
9/29 FIREARMS VIOLA
TION, 2:05 pm  A student en
tered the Campus Police office to 
report that he had seen a 9mm 
handgun lying on a West Wing 
lounge table. Four officers re
sponded to the second floor of 
the West Wing dormitory. They 
spoke with a resident in the room, 
but he said that the firearm 
was not his but his roommates 
and that it was not a firearm at 
all  it was a BB gun. The offic
ers asked to see it, but he said 
that he did not know where it 
was. He assisted the officers in 
locating the gun, which they 
found in the freezer compart
ment of the rooms refrigerator.
After they found the gun, its 
owner entered the room. He ad
mitted to owning the gun and 
said that he had bought it at WalMart for $14. He said that he did 
not know that students were not 
allowed to own BB guns. One of
the officers explained the dan
gers of owning such a BB gun, 
especially if police confronted him 
while it was on his person. The 
officer issued the student an in
ternal citation for possession of a 
firearm and confiscated the gun. 
The officer told the student that 
he could retrieve it at the end of 
the semester. The student said 
that he would never want the gun 
back and told the officers they 
could do what they wanted with 
it. They assured him that it would 
be destroyed.
 Campus Chief of Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior

Colleges must connect 
students with alumni
From a CMU students perspec
tive, Homecoming usually seems 
like a weekend designed solely 
for alumni. While students at
tend events like the Homecoming 
football game and Student Activi
ties receptions, there have been 
few programs specifically planned 
to provide interaction between stu
dents and alumni. However, H&SS 
announced that during this years 
Homecoming weekend, the college 
willhost an event focused onintroducing undergraduate research ef
forts to alumni and providing a 
structured networking opportu
nity for alumni and students. 
H&SS is to be applauded for its 
efforts to make Homecoming week
end a chance for alumni and stu
dents to interact. The University 
should do more to expand oppor
tunities like this to all students.
The event which H&SS has 
planned for some of its under
graduates focuses on the colleges 
advancements in undergraduate 
research. It will give students in
volved in research an opportunity 
to present their accomplishments 
to alumni and to network with 
them academically and socially. 
Any H&SS student who is partici
pating in an independent research 
project is welcome to present his 
or her work, however only a select 
group of H&SS students have been 
directly informed that they are 
eligible to participate.
While concentrating the event 
around a specific academic aspect 
of the college is a good way to 
begin fostering connections be
tween students and alumni, in 
the future H&SS should let more 
students participate. Even those 
students who do not have research 
to present should be encouraged 
to take advantage of this event by 
attending and mingling with the 
alumni. Other colleges should fol
low the example of H&SS and host 
events that promote interaction 
between students and alumni.
Other, less formal events should 
also be planned around the goal of 
creating University-wide studentalumni connections. The Business 
Administration program recently 
announced that it will be hosting a 
panel discussion the weekend be
fore Homecomingfor both students 
and alumni  more colleges need 
to follow suit. For example, a col
lege could host an open lunch for 
alumni and students as a way to 
create relationships between these 
groups in a non-academic and more 
relaxed setting. The individual col
leges and the Office of Student 
Affairs, which plans Homecoming 
weekend, should both take initia
tive in organizing these events.
Both students and alumni can 
benefit professionally and aca
demically from networking 
events, and Homecoming is the 
perfect time for these events to 
take place. H&SS has taken a 
commendable step by creating 
this opportunity for its students. 
The rest of the University should 
also establish innovative | 
and effective ways to bring 
alumni and students together 
during Homecoming.
Library staff deserves 
praise for improvements
Within the last year, the Middle 
States Review board, which reports 
on the strengths and weaknesses 
of area colleges, surveyed CMUs 
facilities and found that one of its 
weaknesses was its library system. 
Since then, the staff at Hunt Li
brary has made many effective 
changes to improve the quality of 
our main library and create more 
resources to help students. The 
Hunt Library staff should be com
mended for these changes, and stu
dents should take advantage of 
these improved resources.
Hunt Librarys reference staff 
has included liaison librarians 
associated with each of the six 
colleges for a few years now, but 
many students have not known 
what a valuable resource they are. 
Thanks to other improvements in 
the library, such as a first-floor 
classroom space and a remodeled 
reference section, more students 
are discovering these helpful li
brarians. Each liaison librarian 
has an expertise specific to one or 
two colleges and is always willing 
to help students find the research 
materials they need.
The library has also made other 
improvements, including the ad
dition of a larger, more formal 
reference desk with appropriate 
signage as well as additional com
puters at more accessible work 
stations. Before these changes, 
the reference desk was not clearly 
marked, and students had diffi
culty knowing where to go with 
reference questions.

Letters to the Editor
Advisor responds 
to apartment fire
Editor:
Due to the re
cent articles and let
ters regarding Cathe
dral Mansions 
[Apartment fire 
raises concerns for 
students, 9/14], I feel it necessary to 
respond. As the community advisor for 
the North Oakland area, which includes 
Cathedral Mansions, the recent articjes 
have upset me. I would like to clear up 
some questions and concerns the cam
pus community seems to be having with 
this residence hall.
The most important message I want to 
convey is the fact that there is absoLetter to 
the Editor
lutely nothing wrong with the fire emer
gency system in the building. The re
ports that the fire alarm system is ques
tionable and other such reports are 
simply not true. There was indeed a 
room fire two weeks ago in the building. 
However, the building alarm was not set 
off because the fire was too small to set 
off any public alarm system. The fire 
was not serious enough to evacuate the 
building. And had it been, the alarm 
would have sounded.
I also would like to respond to a recent 
editorial in The Tartan entitled Hous
ing must ensure apartment conditions. 
[9/21] One of the major complaints in 
this editorial is the maintenance prob
lems in the building. Although there are 
a few cases where paint and plaster 
have fallen from the ceilings, most of the 
rooms are in very good condition. I cer
tainly dont feel that there are problems
in Cathedral that are more serious than 
problems in on-campus housing.
The RAs of the building are very com
mitted to maintaining a safe arid respect
ful community. Unfortunately, at CMU 
and most other campuses, dorm fires are 
not an uncommon experience. I do not 
feel that this was due to a lack of RA 
surveillance. The RAs are aware of the 
challenges this building presents, and 
they compensate for these challenges.
In closing, I hope that I have cleared 
up some questions about the building. I 
feel that many of the students in the 
building are happy with their situation, 
but I encourage any student who is hav
ing any problem to get in touch with 
their RA.

Elections illustrate German divisions
helps students is the addition of a 
classroom section. Hunt Library 
now has a lecture area in the first 
floor reference section with 
enough computers for a class of 
18. Many professors are taking 
advantage of this new space and 
using class sessions to introduce 
students to library resources. For 
example, some history, English 
and modern languages students 
have spent a class period in Hunt 
Library meeting with the liaison 
librarian to the English and His
tory Departments and learning 
about the best ways students can 
approach researching topics for 
those particular courses.
Hunt Library is doing a good job 
of improving its reference section 
despite the fact that reference 
resources are insufficient for a 
first-class research library  we 
lack an adequate selection of pe
riodicals, an effective interlibrary 
loan system, and University-wide 
reference materials. CMU stu
dents who must do extensive re
search are often forced to rely on 
other sources, such as Pitts 
Hillman Library. But Hunts staff 
makes the best of this situation 
by implementing these changes 
and by creating a more helpful 
environment for students.
The Hunt Library staff should 
be commended for its extensive 
changes, and it should continue 
to seek out ways to improve the 
librarys resources. Students 
should take advantage of these 
improvements since they make 
research easier.
Letter from Germany
by Blake Engel
As of last Sunday, Septem
ber 27, Helmut Kohl can take 
a deep breath. After 16 years 
of chancellorship, he was fi
nally ousted in a landslide 
vote to make way for 
Germanys new chancellor, 
Gerhard Schroder.
This election speaks vol
umes about Germany today: 
After decades of Communist
rule in the East, stark dif
ferences still exist between 
the East and the West. The 
election also illuminates 
the German congress and 
cabinet and the fact that 
they are willing to accept 
ideas from the political left 
and right.
Helmut Kohls party, the 
CDU/CSU (Christian Demo
cratic Union, or Christian 
Socialist Union in Bavaria), 
was challenged by Gerhard 
Schroder and the SPD (So
cialist Party of Germany). 
Parties in contention for 
congressional seats were 
the Greens, the FDP (Free 
Democratic Party), and the 
PDS (Party of Democrat
ic Socialists).
The presence of the PDS is 
one of the most telltale signs 
of the German doppleganger: 
The PDS, under its previous
21 percent of the Eastern vote, 
as opposed to 1.5 percent of 
the Western vote. Easterners 
are still facing the shock of 
capitalism, and many prefer

Weird weather takes Pittsburgh by storm
Guido Zanella
Earlier this year, as I was pelted by 
hail and soaked by pouring rain, I tried 
to remember if this weather was sup
posed to be normal for the month of 
September. In retrospect, I must have 
been crazy. No one in their right mind 
compares Pittsburghs weather to that 
of a normal climate, normal meaning 
anything thats not Pittsburgh.
But still, doesnt the recent weather 
seem a bit strange, even for Pittsburgh?
A mere two hours before the hail storm, 
the city was hot and sunny. In just a 
matter of a few minutes, dark clouds 
and gusty winds had blown in. Huge 
drops of rain Started to fall, and after the 
streets had been turned into streams, 
bits of ice began splashing everywhere. 
Everyone ran inside for shelter, and by 
the next time they looked outside, the 
skies were sunny and the ground was 
nearly dry, as if to deny that the storm 
had ever happened in the first place.
Pittsburgh, after an unusually dry 
summer, has experienced quite a few 
flash thunderstorms in the last month. 
With storms that appear out of nowhere 
and disappear just as quickly, not to
mention the hot days with cold 
nights followed by even hotter 
sun the next morning, the 
weather has been exactly what 
you should expect from Pitts
burgh  weird.
But equally strange is what is 
happening between all of the 
other weird weather  namely, 
sun. Where are Pittsburghs typi
cal cloud-covered skies and the 
impending rain? Even the night 
skies have changed. If you look 
up, youll occasionally be startled 
to see black sky and stars in
stead of the reddish haze thats 
usually there on an average Pitts
burgh night.
Something is causing 
Pittsburghs weather patterns 
to stray even further from the 
norm. The question is whatl
A few months ago, the answer 
to that question was easy. The 
public was trained by the media 
to accept the two words El Nio 
as an excuse for nearly anything that 
went wrong. El Nio, which means the 
boy in Spanish, accounted for record 
rainfalls in California, heavy flooding in 
Peru, and tornadoes, droughts, and fires

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  5 October 19987Israeli peace process sparks discussion
Jewish state must make room for all
Open Forum

Any criticisms that those of us here in 
the U.S. might lob at Israel cant help but 
suggest a double standard at work. Like 
us, its a former British colony. Like us, it 
fought its way free of the Empire, then set 
about expanding its borders as far as they 
could, with little care for those unfortunate 
enough to stand in its way. Even the worst 
of the rocket-bomb barrages that its vis
ited on Palestinian villages cant compare, 
by sheer weight of corpses, to what our own 
cavalry wreaked on the indigenous popu
lation back home with only Winchester 
rifles and grim determination.
The parallels between the manifestation 
of our and Israels respective destinies are 
striking. Since the country won its inde
pendence in 1948, th politics of the Holy 
Lands resurrection have pitted its oldslash-new inhabitants against the no
madic Arab tribes whove taken up resi
dence there in the intervening 1,900 years 
since the Diaspora. Pushed off their land 
and relegated to second-class citizenship, 
the nomads developed a national identity 
inherently opposed to Israels, calling the 
country by its Roman name, Palestine. 
While the use of terrorism is indefensible, 
the Palestinians are responding to a cam
paign of marginalization initiated by the 
Israeli government.
Too often, commentaries like this one use 
the word Jew interchangeably with Is
raeli, and to define the conflict in those 
terms is tragically misleading. In the mod
em era, Israel has no more right to speak for 
all Jews than the Pope has to command all 
Christianity. We refer automatically to the 
opposing forces of Islam and Judaism, over
looking the fact that, for the balance of 
history, relations between Muslims and 
Jews have been immeasurably more peace
ful and productive than either religions 
dealings with Christians. Israel holds an 
essential place in Jewish tradition, but we 
have to come to terms with the fact that its 
mythic grounds are now occupied by live 
human beings, as fully capable of wrongdo
ing as the Vaticans Inquisitors. Israel does 
not distinguish between synagogue and 
state, and Jewish fundamentalists mold 
official policy to a degree which would have 
me running for Canada, were such power to 
fall into the hands of the Christian Coalition. Yet the current peace process takes 
this situation as a given. The negotiations, 
when they move forward at all, lurch in the 
direction of a separate Palestinian state. If 
such a state were created, Israel would 
likely see that it be kept subordinate and 
dependent. The poorer half rarely makes 
out well under a partitioning scheme  ask 
Pakistan, East Germany, or West Virginia. 
Why werent the Palestinians made full 
citizens of Israel right from the start? Why 
werent they given a stake in the countrys 
creation? Simply put, a capital-lettered Jew
ish State has no place for a large Muslim 
population.
The foulest, most textbook-perfect mor
sel of bigotry I ever personally digested 
came from an Israeli man with whom I 
made the mistake of raising the Palestin
ian Question. If those people were ever 
made his equal in the eyes of the law, he 
said, theyd breed like the proverbial rab
bits and proceed to destroy the Jewish 
character of Is
rael. I say that it 
is possible to 
bring radically 
different cultures 
together under 
one flag. If our 
assimilationist 
melting pot isnt 
to your taste, con
sider the example 
of Catalunya. Its

quered by

of post-Franco reforms, the northern Span
ish province now thrives as a distinct cul
tural zone. While keepingits own language, 
Catala, and maintaining a degree of au
tonomy under a special governing body, its 
still integrated into the whole of Spain. 
Despite the inevitable tensions that con
tinue under this arrangement, it has long 
seemed to me that this is the ideal model for 
Israel to follow. As things now stand, it 
continues to repress a disadvantaged mi
nority in the name of a religion that, over 
the past two millennia, has defined itself.by 
proud survival in the face of persecution in 
every comer of the world. Israels hypocrisy 
mars its character more severely than any 
demographic shift ever could.

Israel-Palestine conflict could be easily

His capacity as realtor
With the Israeli victory over the Arabs 
in the first Arab-Israeli War and the 
resulting proclamation of the state of 
Israel on May 15,1948, the Zionist dream
 the establishment of a national home
 seemed to finally be realized. Sadly, 
the realization of that dream has turned 
into a nightmare from which the Middle 
East has still not awaken half a century 
later. With the establishment of the state 
of Israel, hundreds of thousands of Arabs 
were forced to flee from the land they 
called Palestine  a land that had been
theirs since the 
seventh century. 
Homeless and 
embittered, the 
Arabs became 
bent on elimi
nating the Zion
ist entity  for 
years they re
jected all com
promises offered 
by the Zionists. 
Their hate has 
carried down 
through genera
tion after gen
eration, spawnWinnie Liang/Tartan Junior Staff jng a number of
aggressive Islamic militant groups like 
Hamas, whose terrorist activities have 
cost the lives of many civilians, both 
Israeli and Palestinian.
Today the Arabs and Israelis are dead
locked in a struggle for the land that both 
peoples believe to be rightfully theirs. 
Since both sides are equally adamant 
about their claim to the land, neither 
side has made much headway in terms of 
fulfilling their ultimatum. And, in the 
light of the recent peace talks held in 
Washington D.C., between Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Pal
estinian leader Yassir Arafat, it is clear 
that a final resolution is still a long 
way off.
Thus the situation in the Middle East 
is, to say the least, complex and highly 
volatile  a single spark of violence 
could conceivably set off a chain reac
tion leading ultimately to another ArabIsraeli war. The last thing that Palestine needs right now is an out-and-out 
war with Israel  with the U.S. backing 
Israel, Palestinians do not have strong 
international support outside of the 
Middle East. This is why Arafat needs to 
take a definite stand against the Islamic 
militant groups that pose a threat to the 
peace process. Terrorist attacks by 
groups like Hamas, which directly op
pose Arab-Israeli peace, violate the Oslo 
Declaration of Principles of September 
of 1993, and, in doing so, give Israel an 
excuse to back down on Palestines de
mands. Furthermore, terrorist activi
ties simply invite military retaliation 
from Israel  a clear case of violence 
begetting violence.
Another reason that Arafat should cur
tail the growth of terrorist movements is 
that just the existence of so many ren
egade factions could cloud Palestines ul
timate political aim of acquiring an inde
pendent state. Moreover, the myriad 
Islamic groups that oppose Arab-Israeli 
peace break down the sense of a common 
purpose and undermine the authority 
of Arafats government  something that 
Palestine cannot afford to have happen.
Palestinian leaders should also refrain 
from making brash public statements 
like Arafats vow to establish an inde
pendent Palestinian state on May 4, 
1999, the date that the Oslo accords 
have set as the deadline for a final agree
ment between Israel and Palestine. 
While such not-so-subtle threats may 
serve to bolster hope and patriotism in 
Palestine, they severely retard the 
progress of the ongoing negotiations by 
putting Israel on the defensive. This 
could only lead to counter-threats and 
more counter-threats with no progress 
as far as a concrete settlement is con
cerned. Arafat must have realized 
this because he made it a point not 
to reiterate his vow at a later speech 
in Washington.
One thing is for sure though  it is not 
possible for either Israel or Palestine to 
achieve all their mandates; some com
promise will have to be made. Reaching 
such a settlement will take time  
months or possibly even years. Mean
while, Palestine should work to elimi
nate disruptive Islamic factions that aim 
to stop the peace process and should not 
issue the kind of veiled threats and warn
ings that would leave Israel in a defen
sive position with no choice but to exert 
its military authority.

Transfer student adapts to CMU
Susan Leu
So how do you like it here?
Faced with this innocent inquiry from 
otherwise well-meaning strangers, I 
have learned to respond with something 
generic enough not to offend, at least not 
until its clear that the inquirers arent 
from around here. If they are, however, 
chances are that they would take it the 
wrong way if I unloaded on them my 
feelings about the unbearable weather, 
dirty buildings, crumbly hillside homes, 
endless bridge-related traffic, and acute
shortage of nightlife. I am not ____
alone in my complaints  virtu
ally every other displaced Cali
fornian Ive spoken to has similar 
gripes. Its too easy to confuse my 
general impression of Pittsburgh 
with that of CMU, and I have to 
be careful not to make the Uni
versity the target of my ill will 
towards the rest of the town.
Having just transferred here ____
from a junior college in the Bay 
Area, I know very little of Pittsburgh. 
Ive only once actually ventured out into 
the town, courtesy of Orientation Weeks 
guided city bus tours, but that one tour 
was enough to discourage my explor
ative side, at least for a while. The rest 
of Orientation was a string of rather 
trying activities for freshmen, with whom 
I found myself lumped.
Granted, the transfer students had 
their own Orientation activities planned, 
but there werent many of them and they 
didnt seem nearly as dynamic as what 
the class of 2002 was doing. They were 
less dynamic in the sense that we had 
neither our own comedian nor illusion
ist but I suspect that was largely due to 
th small number of transfer students. 
At! the Transfer Student Dinner and
Q&A meeting  two of the few events 
created expressly for transfers  I'saw 
roughly thirty-some students in atten
dance. They did not appear to be the 
types who went in for live shows under 
the big top or Clippership festivities. 
In addition, our orientation activities 
were limited because it was inconve
nient for the entire group to congregate 
for said activities, and I sensed the 
interest was not really there  we 
had already lived a fair share of college 
life and had little need for anything 
that called itself Lets Talk 
About Sex.
With Orientation Week six weeks be
hind me, my general feeling now is one 
of displacement. Scholastically speak. ing, I find myself to be more focused and
The biggest adjustment I 
must make is to adapt to the 
pace of school life on campus 
and to the climate, meteoro
logically and otherwise. 
studious than the other first-years, and 
yet my course load and lack of expertise 
with CMU institutions (teachers, build
ings, Dining Services) do not allow me 
to relate to the third-years. For one 
thing, it seems like everyone else my 
age is a lot more computer savvy than I 
am. At Santa Rosa Junior College, stu
dents rarely even started an email ac
count with the school server. During 
my two years there, only one class re
quired the use of any major software. 
Interestingly enough, roughly half the 
students in my Santa Rosa Calc II class 
had TI-92s, despite the fact that the 
school only offered maybe three math 
classes beyond Calc II.
Needless to say, the academic envi
ronment at the junior college was far
from demanding  compared to CMU, 
it was almost giving. Many of the stu
dents attend the junior college to ob
tain vocational licenses or two-year 
(associates) degrees for specific trades. 
Many of the rest of us go there in order 
to satisfy our GenEd requirements so 
that we may transfer to a real univer
sity. This is not uncommon in Califor
nia, where there are well over a dozen 
public state universities, but, because 
there are many more students than 
can be accomodated, some administra
tors encourage the junior and commu
nity colleges to aid in the process, espe
cially for the first couple of years.
Apparently this is not the case here, 
because when I tell people I trans
ferred from a junior college, they find
________ it almost strange that I am
here at all. I suppose they 
expect that in attending a 
junior college, my educa
tional goal was to obtain a 
certificate in Peace Officers 
Training, or another area 
meant for students who 
might not be bright or ambi
tious enough to make it into 
^^^1 a real university in the first 
place. (Although admittedly 
it was hard even for me not to feel that 
way, especially as some of my class
mates at Santa Rosa considered Key
boarding to be a computer course, 
and the Algebra sections seemed to be 
pretty full.)
The biggest adjustment I must make 
is to adapt to the pace of school life on 
campus and to the climate, meteoro
logically and otherwise. While trans
ferring to CMU has stepped the rigor of 
my academic life up many notches, it 
has sized down my opportunities for 
other types of expansion.

Defeat of chancellor represents new era
GERMANY, from page 6
with the other 79 percent of Easterners, 
who voted much more heavily for a new 
government headed up by Gerhard 
Schroder and the SPD than did West
erners. Looldng at a color-coded map of 
the vote distribution is like looking at a 
map of the former Germanies; the East 
is almost completely homogenous in 
their decision for SPD, whereas the west 
voted roughtly fifty-fifty between SPD 
and CDU.
The reason for this is partially the 
need for post-Communism reconstruc
tion. West Germans dont see every day 
that the East still has endless aban
doned warehouses, factories, and apart
ment complexes. Since reunification, the 
West has been pouring money into 
the East, but the necessity for more is 
still dire.
The need for reconstruction aside, 
Westerners and Easterners alike face a 
multitude of common problems: There 
is a huge shortage of social security 
funds for the coming generations. The 
tax system is atrociously unfair. And 
unemployment is stiflingly high across 
the country.
Unemployment currently stands 
right around 12 percent, a figure for 
which Kohl is sometimes blamed. Af
ter all, he is often considered the chan
cellor of unemployment. In his own 
defense, Kohl has pointed out that 
Germanys job pains cannot be blamed 
on one man when the whole country 
underwent such unprecedented change 
just eight years ago. Not to mention 
that Kohl is to be commended for 
his expert handling of the reunifica
tion process, which happened more 
peacefully than any other revolution 
in history.
The most sweeping changes this elec
tion will bring about are not directly 
from the Chancellors office, but rather
from that of the foreign minister, 
Joschka Fischer. A member of the 
Greens party, Fischer supports, issues 
such as equal rights for women and 
gays and lesbians, and, on the nega
tive side, outlandishly high gas 
prices. Most of these ideas will not 
come into effect, but just having Fischer 
and the Greens in office will bring 
about minor changes. For instance, a 
six-pfennig-(four-cent)-per-liter oil tax 
already seems inevitable. Fischer has 
also proposed that a 130 kilometerper-hour speed limit be imposed 
on Germanys world famous Auto
bahns in the interest of gas conserva
tion. Fischer has been, for the most 
part, well-received, but many others 
stick with their conservative 
CDU/CSU roots.
Germany will also soon see a differ
ence in the chancellors cabinet; in 
choosing members for his cabinet, 
Schrder had' the choice to form a 
Grand Coalition with the CDU or a 
so-called Red-Green coalition consist
ing of the SPD, the Greens, and the 
PDS, which would be pitted against 
the CDU/CSU. Nearly everyone is re
lieved that Schrder has chosen the 
Red-Green path, as the Grand Coali
tion with the CDU could very well 
have resulted in a political superpower 
in the cabinet and essentially destroyed 
the concept of democracy.
Regardless of what happens to Ger
many in the next four years, it cant be 
much worse than the governmental 
standstill of the past few years. Kohl 
has done his duty and done it well. 
We will soon find out if Schrder can 
do better.

Corporate interests 
control U.S. media
Yishan Wong
We receive little news that is 
not presented according to how it 
would profit those who fund the 
media. A news agency that pub
lishes a scathing article criticiz
ing the practices of a company 
can expect a withdrawal of ad
vertising dollars. For example, it 
is riot profitable for U.S. corpora
tions that hold business interests 
in the Middle East to allow the 
public to know that people in 
those areas would simply like 
th U.S. to withdraw from their 
lives and be left to live in peace. 
These terrorists have been 
pushed to guerilla action against 
an! imperialist power driven by 
economic interests just as our 
patriots were 200 years ago. 
A Newspaper that loudly trum
pets these things can expect little 
in ; advertising dollars from the 
corporations whose interests 
it opposes.
How much do you think it costs 
to produce a newspaper? Twentyfive cents? Fifty? Try again. That 
doesnt even begin to cover the 
cost of the pulp, much less print
ing or employee salaries. We get 
newspapers today for less than a 
dollar because most of them have 
anenormous readership and can, 
therefore, bring in high revenues 
from advertisers. With the 
amount of money that newspa
pers get from their readers, they 
dont owe much to them  its the 
advertisers paying their costs that 
they work for. Newspapers dont 
sell you the news, they sell corpo
rations an audience. Its a capi
talist market, and the most suc
cessful newspapers are out to 
make money. Hence, the ones 
who make the most money 
are the ones who best serve up an 
audience to the corporations 
who have the money to pay 
for them.
But, however much advertis
ing dollars may rule newspapers, 
the papers represent mere eco
nomic fiefdoms compared to tele
vision. Besides the costs of the 
equipment itself,, we dont pay for
television at all. Its completely 
free. We can get news about the 
world, learn things, and be en
tertained at no charge to us. Who 
pays for all this? All the major 
television broadcasting stations 
are owned by less than a dozen 
companies  yet they provide 
the vast majority of our program
ming. Theyre owned by large 
companies like GE and 
Westinghouse, whose interests do 
not lie in responsible journalism 
but in their own domain. Fur
thermore, television stations de
rive all of their revenue from ad
vertising dollars.
The greater the percentage of a 
media source given over to adver
tising, the more we can expect it 
to pander to the tastes of adver
tisers. Corporations can now fun
nel their budgets into advertis
ing instead of product develop
ment. So long as they own and 
pay for our primary mode of in
formation intake, they dont 
need to meet consumer needs  
they can, through advertising 
dollars, influence us into buying 
what they have to sell. It is no 
longer the consumer dictating the 
market, but the producers dictat
ing what consumers want.
Advertising has not only be
trayed this important aspect of 
capitalism, but it has also taken 
away a valuable part of democ
racy  the informed and knowl
edgeable public. Today, when 
people need to be more well-in
formed than ever, we get almost 
all of our information from a me
dia whose sources of revenue are 
totally out of our hands. Public 
broadcasting in America is a farce, 
demonized by those who call it 
government-controlled media. 
Well, last time I looked, demo
cratic government was decided 
by the people, and its in corpora
tions that executives wield dicta
torial authority. If they own and 
pay for everything we see and 
hear, then perhaps we see only 
the curtain of slogans and jingles 
veiling totalitarianism.

Honorary degrees bypass academic process

to President Cohon, is that 
it will make the school bet
ter known to the public.
However, helping the 
University become more of 
a household name will 
come at a price  that of 
the intrinsic value of the 
degree itself. After all, ob
taining an undergraduate 
or graduate degree is a 
process that involves years 
of well-defined work, in
cluding classes, exams, 
projects, and papers. Im
plicit in the degree is a 
statement that the recipi
ent has produced work at 
or above an objectively des
ignated level.
As a computer science 
major, the requirements 
I must meet are well-planned. 
I take 10 CS courses, five of 
which are required for all ma
jors. The other five I select 
from categories such as appli
cations and theory. On top of 
that, I must take five math 
courses, for which all majors 
must have credit. I must also 
take four science and engineer
ing courses, one of which must 
have a lab component, eight 
courses from H&SS or CFA, 
four of which much meet spe
cific breadth requirements, 
nine classes for my required 
minor and free electives, and 
the Computer Skills Work
shop. That totals 37 courses. 
Thus, my receiving a degree 
in computer science means 
that Ive completed a process 
 taking a series of courses,
all of which have assign
ments, projects, and papers  
in order to demonstrate my 
overall academic worth as a 
CS major.
To provide honorary degrees 
is to short-circuit this process. 
Instead of completing specific

tain a degree. This lack of strict 
objectivity means that the hon
orary degree has the potential 
to be doubly insulting  to the
of itself. After all, if the con
tribution is less than the 
worth of a degree, its difficult 
to justify either giving the de

it sends the message that the 
work required for a traditional 
degree in itself is almost use
less, if someone else can 
obtain a degree through 
providing significant con
tributions instead of tak

Honorary degrees can 
also insult the concept of 
the degree. By providing 
a degree for different stan
dards than those that 
are traditionally accepted, 
but positioning it as a de
gree nevertheless, it be
comes a mere piece of pa

of the value in a degree 
is in its difficulty to ob

Volleyball squad dominates home court tournament
VOLLEYBALL, from page 12
seemed destined to signal a turnaround 
in the teams fortunes as it started the 
day against one of the weaker teams in 
the field, Brandeis University. Things 
did not turn out as smoothly as could be 
hoped, though, as the team lost the first 
game. This was to be the end of its losing 
streak, however, as it was able to quickly 
regroup to win the next three games and 
the match. It was a morning match, and 
we got off to a slow start trying to bounce 
back from the previous day, Webb said. 
But, we won and that helped us get our 
confidence back.
Next up for the Tartans were the 
most dramatic, hard-fought matches 
of the weekend against the Univer
sity of Chicago and New York Univer
sity. Both matches went the full five 
games and were finally decided by 
rally scores. After winning the first 
two games against Chicago, the team 
lost the next two before coming back 
to win the deciding fifth game 16-14. 
The match against NYU, described as 
an epic battle by Webb,, was even 
more intense, with the Tartans even
tually losing 19-21 in the deciding 
game. Most of the credit for the tough
ness the team showed went to the 
defense as the Tartans pulled out 118 
digs in the NYU match alone, 37 by 
junior Ashley Kinsey.
CMU wrapped up the tournament on 
September 27 with matches against 
Johns Hopkins University and the Uni
versity of Rochester. The weekends 
frustrations continued against Johns 
Hopkins as the team lost the deciding 
fourth game 15-0, but the team ended 
the tournament on a positive note by 
defeating Rochester.
On the whole, the weekend was con
sidered a success as the team improved 
from last years 0-8 showing to 3-5 
and took large steps towards proving 
that it can be competitive in the UAA. 
We are now just as competitive as the 
rest of the teams [in the UAA] with the 
exception of Washington, said Webb.
Looking to build on its newfound 
confidence, the team returned home to 
play host to its own tournament last 
Saturday. Facing weaker, non-conference schools, the team breezed through 
to the finals with little difficulty. In 
the first round, the Tartans did not 
lose a single game while dominating 
both Thiel College and Hilbert Col
lege. CMU was firing on all six cylin
ders as the entire lineup produced posi
tive results. Led by junior Stephanie 
Szobota and freshman Sara 
Lechleitner, who routinely turned 
Putaros pin-point sets into easy kills, 
the team dispatched Thiel in just over 
an hour and surrendered only five
points to Hilbert. Szobota, for one, was 
happy to have such easy matches in 
the early rounds. We knew we had a 
good shot at winning [the tourna
ment].... It was good having easy 
matches out front to get us going in the 
morning, she said.
After a short break, it was right back 
to work for the Tartans as they faced 
Bethany College in the semifinals. New 
opponent, same result for CMU, who 
continued to tower above the competi
tion, winning 15-7, 15-2, and 15-0. 
We really thought [Bethany] would 
be better, Webb said. But we de
stroyed them.
The finals did prove to be a different 
story, as Marietta College looked to 
provide more of a challenge for the 
Tartans. From the first game, it was 
evident that this would be a long, com
petitive match as CMU finally prevailed 
15-12 in a game marred by poor offici
ating. The Tartans could have easily 
found themselves on the short end of 
the three-point margin if a few ques
tionable calls had not gone their way. 
With the score tied at 5, CMU received 
a huge break when they were given the 
go-ahead point on a ball that appeared 
to land just past the endline. Later, 
Marietta was denied a score that would 
have tied the game on another close 
line call, and CMU never trailed again.
Perhaps focusing some of their frus
tration over the officials calls, 
Marietta stormed through the second 
game, handing the Tartans their first 
loss of the day, 15-5. Their success, 
however, was short-lived as CMU won 
the next two games to clinch the match 
and the tournament.
The Tartans success revolved pri
marily around the play of middle hit
ters Szobota and Lechleitner combined 
with the team commitment to solid 
defense. Our middle is our strength, 
Webb said. Other teams gear to shut  
down our middle and they cant do it.1*' 
Szobota and Putaro were named to the 
all-tournament team. The teams ' 
record is now 15-8.
The team will play two matches this 
week against local colleges.

Womens tennis falls to Mercyhurst
By RICH TORIO
Tartan Staffwriter
Whatever happened to home court 
advantage? There was nothing advan
tageous about the adverse conditions 
the Carnegie Mellon University womens 
tennis team tried to overcome on Wednes
day against Mercyhurst College.
The wind was blistering, the Kiltie 
bands bass drums boomed in the back
ground, and academic engagements 
forced a rearrangement of the starting 
lineup. No excuses, was the simple 
and straight-faced reply to the condi
tions that may have contributed to the 
surprising 3-6 loss to Mercyhurst.
Even early on in the doubles matches, 
it was apparent that the Carnegie 
Mellong team would be in for a long 
day. The first doubles team of senior 
Keri Mills and sophomore Elisabeth 
Brown easily won their match, 8-4, but 
the second and third teams both 
struggled, understandably. First-year 
students Jill Palermo and Kelly
Chanopas were unable to play, throw
ing off the teams chemistry. Senior 
Whitney Brooks filled in for Palermo, 
joining senior Julie Balch to comprise 
the Tartans second doubles team.
Lisette Miller-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
CMU lost to Mercyhurst College 6-3.
The Balch-Brooks tandem fell 4-8. 
Junior Anika Amin (filling in for 
Chanopas) teamed up with sophomore 
Jessica Chiu. Once again, the teams 
inexperience playing together was evi
dent, as they lost 1-8.
Palermo and Chanopas arrived in time 
to play singles, but Balch balked at her 
chance to play. With Balch leaving for 
academic reasons, the rest of the team 
had to play up a spot, and Chiu had to fill 
in at the number six slot.
I think we [did] well, considering the 
circumstances, said Brown. We [were] 
only missing one player.... I dont know 
if it hurt us that badly.
Thats easy for her to say. Brown, as 
usual, played in the second slot, and, as 
usual, she won with ease, 6-0,6-3. Browns 
win was one of the two singles victories, 
and countingher doubles win, she accounted 
for two of the three CMU victories on the 
day. A model of modesty, she said, I was 
feeling all right  I was pretty consistent. 
The other CMU singles win came from 
Brooks. Playing in the number five slot,
she had to scratch 
and claw her way 
through a three 
setter, eventually 
winning 4-6, 6-2,
7-6 (7-5). Brooks 
was determined 
and won des
pite dropping the 
first set.
Three-time AllAmerican Keri 
Mills played in a 
three-setter as 
well, but did not 
fare quite as well.
After falling in the 
first set, 5-7, Mills 
fired up her forehand and dominated 
the second set 6-2, forcing a third. The 
final set was close, decided by only one 
break, and Mills lost a heartbreaker 
5-7, 6-2, 4-6.

well. The final score: CMU 3, 
Mercyhurst 6.
Mercyhurst has always been a tough - 
Division II opponent, said Moss. With 
a makeshift lineup we played them well 
The rest of the matches were not so  everyone is plajHng well, and Im 
close. Palermo fell 1-6, 5-7; Chanopas confident the team will do better with alost 2-6, 2-6; and Chiu lost 2-6, 2-6 as little more work.

The second half resulted in much of the 
same style of play as the first. The CMU 
defense held strong, aided by freshmen 
Melanie Stawartz and Kathy Travnicek.
The physical nature of the game 
seemed to escalate, and frustration set 
in for the Tartan offense. They had a 
pair of very questionable offsides penal
ties called against them. Sophomore Kari 
Pylypyshyn, who was injured early in 
the second half going up for a head ball, 
drew a yellow card for discussing mat
ters with the referee.
The Tartans offensive surge in the 
second half again consisted of a number 
of break-aways. Their best scoring oppor
tunity came on a comer kick with three 
minutes left in the game. The NYU of
fense was able to push the ball out of the 
box and safely up field, though.
The game ended with no additional 
scoring, although there was a flurry of 
action in the CMU defensive zone as time 
ran out. Smith pushed aside all three of 
NYUs shots on goal, and CMU won 1-0.
The team also played last Sunday 
against perennial powerhouse Emory. 
Kendra was optimistic going into the 
game. They are a real tough team, she 
said. They will take advantage of our 
mental errors quickly if we get down on 
ourselves. I think our mental game is 
something that we have really improved 
on during the day, so I think we should 
have good game.
The team ended up losing to Emory 2-0.

President Richard Cyert was im
pressed by the show of interest

but the CMU crew team has al

was no exception.
We have a smaller varsity 
team this year than last but fin
ished better, said Tocknell.
The clubs highest finish of the 
day was in the mens club event. 
CMU A took sixth place out of 25. 
I think it was a very good race, 
said graduate student Paul Riley, 
who was part of the A team. I was 
actually expecting worse. Other 
team A memebers were sopho
more Dave Clumpner, senior Mar
tin Rich-ards, junior Andy Edgar, 
and coxswain Chris Raubacher.
The womens CMU B team also 
placed well, finishing 16th out of 30,
and the mens doubles team of jun
ior Jeffrey Beene and sophomore 
Neil Stroup came in 16th out of 17. 
The 48-degree temperatures and 
winds gusting up to 25 miles per 
hour arguably added another 
challenge to the races.
Things were a little choppy, 
but we handled it, said Riley.
Niejadlik put the conditions in 
perspective: Weather doesnt 
matter. Were down on the water 
every day at 5 am in darkness, so' 
were used to it.
Some even argue that the rain; 
offsets the wind by keeping the 
water flatter. So maybe the miser
able conditions were a blessing in 
disguise. Then again, standing on 
the edge of the river, one is hardpressed to see any advantage in 
the numbing cold and wind.
Regardless of the weather, the 
CMU teams were happy with the  
days performance. For our first 
real race of the season, I think we 
did really well, said Neijadlik.
Tocknell is also optimistic for 
the teams future. We have over 
30 novices on the team now. They 
are all dedicated and learning 
quickly, she said.

The Steelers Corner
by Rich Torio
I agree with Lester that the Steelers have 
to go back to basics, but that doesnt mean 
that they have to go back a century in strat
egy. Hell, last week the Steelers looked like a 
rugby team; it looked like the forward pass 
was still illegal or something.
Im not blaming Stewart for last weeks 
offensive ineptitude. Maybe he played poorly 
in the other games, but last week he didnt 
even get a chance to play poorly.
Im blaming offensive coordinator Ray 
Sherman. I agree that Sherman had to do
KDKA-TV sports anchor Bob Pompeani 
thinks that last weeks rushing attack should 
open up the passing game in the future. 
That running game should allow [the 
Steelers] to become better, more proficient 
passers as we go along, said Pompeani. If it 
doesnt, were in for a long year. But, I think 
it will, and it takes time.
At least when the offense flounders, as it 
has done so often lately, they have a consis
tent punter this year. Josh Miller, once 
thought of as a weak link of the team, is
As I predicted, the Steelers ground out a 
win last week against the Seattle Seahawks. 
The good news was that Seattle scored fewer 
points than I had anticipated; the bad news 
was that the Steelers scored fewer points 
than the few that I had expected them to 
score. Once again, the defense was inspiring 
and the offense was impotent. Steelers 13, 
Seahawks 10.
Speaking of impotence, Kordell Stewart 
seems to be lacking the spunk that made 
him one of the leagues most exciting quar
terbacks. All that the fans can say about his 
performance last week was, At least he 
didnt throw any interceptions  at least he 
didnt lose the game. Then again, its pretty 
hard to throw interceptions when youre 
handing off every down. Its also pretty hard 
to get in the end zone if you never pass the 
ball down field.
You test the waters and you try to throw 
the ball, said Steelers fullback Tim Lester, 
who has spent the season watching from the 
sidelines with an injury. When it doesnt 
work, you always go back to what worked for 
you in the past. Running the ball is how 
weve always won games, so we went back to 
that last week.
something different last week with Kordell; I having one of the best seasons in the NFL. As 
agree that the Steelers had to rurfthe football sad as it may sound, the teams most immore; I even agree that Stewart had to take proved player, and one of the stars this year, 
fewer risks last week, but that doesnt mean has been Miller, the punter, 
no risks at all. When asked about how he overcame the
past two seasons of adversity, 
Miller said, You just got to be
lieve in your technique and be
lieve what got you here. And 
you cant listen to what other 
people say because no one knows 
how hard you work in anything. 
I knew things would come 
around, and slowly but surely 
they are.
For the past two seasons, 
Steelers fans, myself included, 
have booed Josh Miller off the 
field and begged the adminis
tration to let him go. This sea
son, he has turned it all around 
and made us all look like fools. Im hoping 
that Ray Sherman will do the same. Im 
hoping that the offense will catch fire and 
make me sound like an idiot. Im just hoping 
that it wont take two seasons to happen. 
Post-game Prognostications: (1-0)
I predict that the Steelers will not play this 
week. Wow, thats a tough one.
James Mojonnler/Tartan Art Editor
Instead of Sherman redefining Stewarts 
role in the game plan, Sherman seems to 
have redefined the game plan without Kordell. 
Last week the Steelers didnt even try to pass 
the ball down field against the Seahawks. 
Although I agree that you have to run to set 
up the pass, I still believe that the threat of 
the deep pass has to be present in every game.Team prepares for

Tartans dominate 
home tournament
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
With the UAA championship 
tournament coming up in less 
than a month, the CMU 
womens volleyball team is 
ready to show that it is tired of 
the lack of respect shown to it 
by the rest of the league. Its 
. performance in a pair of tour
naments over the past two 
weekends went a long way to
wards accomplishing that goal.
The weekend of September 
25-27 saw the team travel to 
Washington University of St. 
Louis for the round-robin seg
ment of the UAA tournament. 
Emotions were high as the Tar
tans prepared to begin their 
quest to earn the respect they 
so desired, but fate dealt their 
hopes a cruel blow in the form 
of the seeding draw. Our draw 
/ was very tough, playing the top 
two teams first, back-to-back, 
head coach Julie Webb said. 
1 The top two teams were Emory
University and host and na
tional number one Washington 
University. Facing these two 
powerhouses in consecutive 
matches led to a very frustrat
ing opening day for CMU. We 
played very scared [against 
Washington], and that carried 
over into the Emory match, 
said Webb.
The team failed to win a game 
in either best-of-five match, but 
had no time to feel sorry for 
itself, turning right around to 
face another tough rival in Case 
Western Reserve University. 
Changing opponents did not1 
help the Tartans on this day, 
though, as they dropped their 
third straight match three 
games to one. We did not play 
to win, and took them for 
granted because we had beaten 
them before, said Webb.
At the end of the opening day, 
the teams record stood at 0-3 
with five matches left to play.

Crew debuts in annual regatta
Soccer team battles 
pair of division rivals
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Editor
Imagine a half-dozen CMU students 
dangling off the Sixth Street Bridge in 
downtown Pittsburgh, screaming at 
passing boats. Now imagine over 4,000 
rowers, coaches, and coxswains braving 
the frigid temperatures and gusty winds 
of Pittsburgh, and you have a good pic
ture of the scene at last Saturdays Head 
of the Ohio regatta.
The annual event, hosted by the Three 
Rivers Rowing Association, is the secondlargest regatta of its kind in the country. 
Competition ranged from high school and 
youth teams to collegiate varsity teams and 
international clubs. From nationally ranked 
high schools like Canisius High School in 
Buffalo, N.Y., to the American, Canadian, 
and British national teams, all age groups 
and skill levels were represented. The re
gatta also marked the official opening of the 
;CMU crew clubs 1998-99 season.
People tend to like this race because 
of Pittsburghs landscapes, said junior 
and crew club member Greg Niejadlik.
All the bridges are interesting and tend 
to break up the course.
This is by far our biggest race of the 
fall season, said junior and club public
ity chair Erin Tocknell. The team raced 
boats in five events  mens doubles, 
mens and womens club 4, mens singles, 
and womens lightweights.
In addition, CMU alumni and former 
members of the club took advantage of 
the regatta to hone their skills.
I didnt even know [the alumni] were 
racing, said Tocknell. I just saw our 
boat coming down the river with people 
that were definitely too old to be stu
dents! After the race, the club celebrated 
the day with an alumni banquet.
The history of CMU crew goes back to 
1987. Legend has it that after being 
recognized as an official club by StuPlease see CREW, page 10 The Carnegie Mellon B Team rows under the Sixth Street Bridge en route to the finish line in Roberto Clemente Park.
Football team suffers stunning defeat
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Last Saturday the Tartans suf
fered at the hands of Dickinson in 
what has become their worst per
formance all season, a disappoint
ing loss of 37-3. They were sim
ply outplayed  offensively, de
fensively, special teams. Head 
coach Rich Lackner doesnt even 
want to talk about it.
It was ugly. There is only 
one way to describe it  it was 
ugly, said Lackner. I cannot 
say one good thing about that 
football game.
Indeed, the Tartans did not fare 
well duringthe game, tallying only 
80 yards rushing and 54 yards 
passing after four quarters of play. 
Junior running back Mike Campie 
rushed for only 29 yards the en
tire game, a far cry from the 150 
yards he gained in last weeks 
game against Alfred University.
I dont put the blame on one 
person or one side of the ball, 
said Lackner. It was a total lack 
of team effort.
Dickinson dominated the first 
quarter with two scoring drives. 
The first resulted in a 28-yard 
field goal four minutes into
play. That was followed by a 
Tartan fumble and Dickinsons 
subsequent 30-yard fumble re
turn which brought the score to 
10-0, Dickinson.
The second quarter marked the 
Tartans only scoring drive of the 
night. Less than two minutes into 
the quarter, a 13-yard Tartan 
march ended in a 34-yard field 
goal courtesy of senior kicker Matt 
Jarrock. He upped the score to 
10-3. It was all downhill for the 
Tartan from there.
Dickinson dominated the rest 
of the second quarter, starting 
with a 41-yard field goal five min
utes after CMUs 3-point kick and 
followed by another field goal, 
this time for 36 yards, only six 
minutes later. With 36 seconds 
left in the first half, Dickinson 
capitalized on a 30-yard drive by 
finding Tommy Chung in the end 
zone. After a failed two-point con
version, Dickinson trotted off to 
the locker room secure in their 
22-3 halftime lead.
The second half proved no bet
ter for the Tartans, as Chung once 
again rallied in the endzone only 
two minutes into the third quar
ter. With the score at 30-3, CMU 
dug in and tried to hang on until
the games end. Dickinson scored 
once more on a 13-yard pass in the 
middle of the fourth quarter, bring
ing the final score to a lopsided 
37-3 in favor of Dickinson.
Lackner looked at this game 
as the perfect example of what 
can happen when a team doesnt 
go into a game 
ready to play.
While he cited this 
mentality as the 
main reason for 
the Tartans poor 
performance, 
there were other 
factors involvedin 
the poor defeat.
We have a lot of 
kids beat up, 
knicked up, and 
bruised, said 
Lackner. First 
thing we have to do 
is get healthy.
Then were going to 
make corrections
 were going to go 
back to basics and 
fundamentals of 
blocking and tack
ling and continue 
to coach hard and 
improve. There are
still five games to go, and we can 
win all five of those games if we 
continue to improve.
After playing four of their first 
five games on the road, the Tar
tans return home to battle Chi
cago in the Homecoming game 
October 16.

The womens cross country 
team defeated the Wolverines of 
Grove City and the Duquesne 
Dukes this past weekend. If 
youve been following this team, 
this shouldnt come as a big sur
prise.
Last season the CMU women

that team, with returning seniors

GETTING OUT

Students build ties through excursion s
Organizations offer help 
for planners of activities
By KATIE MARTINEZ
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Sure, it seems easy enough to 
plan out and execute a paintball 
trip, but when it really gets down to 
it, how much time and effort does it 
take to get from the dorm to the bat
tleground? While in theory extract
ing funds from the many studentoriented resources on campus 
seems like it should be a quick
process, in actuality it often takes a 
lot more effort and time than one 
might think.
Generally, if a residence hall or 
group wants to go on an off-campus 
excursion and they need some extra 
funding, they go to the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC). The 
process begins with an email sent to 
the residential  programming chair 
of SDC. Next, the person proposing 
the trip goes to a meeting with some
SDC members to explain the details 
of the trip such as what they want 
to do, where and when they want to 
go, what other kind of funding they 
already have, and how they plan to 
publicize the event.
In response to the proposal, th 
SDC committee gives the group 
feedback on the plans they have 
presented as well as tips and advice 
based on their past experiences

Athletes bond on road trips
Short events unite students
By KATIE KOWALL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Athletes are fierce competitors 
who live for the adrenaline rush 
that is produced in light of a victory. 
They revel in sweat and pain and 
spend a significant portion of their 
lives there.
Any group of people bound togeth
er by such qualities must have a 
special type of relationship even 
outside of the competition. A lot of 
this bonding between teammates 
occurs on trips that the teams take 
to other colleges. These trips bring 
students closer together with people 
on their own teams, and sometimes 
even with people from other teams.
The crew team, which meets for 
practice at 5:30 every morning, 
knows a lot about bonding as a 
team, according to sophomore busi
ness administration major David 
Clumpner. [In crew] you form a 
tight friendship circle with basically 
everyone, he said.
More than the conversations that 
the rowers have on road trips, and 
the team dinners that are tradition 
the night before a big race, the 
major force that brings the team 
together as friends is merely the 
fact that during races, the members 
must Work very closely together in 
order to succeed.
Everyone has to be in tune with 
one another because one persons
mistake will affect the whole boat,  
said Clumpner.
He recalls one particular race ii 
Philadelphia last year where th<! 
chemistry of the rowers in his boa; 
was crucial. They were novice row  
ers, and they had to manipulate 
their finals schedule at Carnegio 
Mellon in order to go to the race 
Overcoming such adversity brough ; 
them closer together. They didn; 
win, Clumpner said, but they had ; 
great row. Team chemistry makes 
all the difference on the river.
Sports teams like Ultimat 
Frisbee take a different approach ti 
team bonding, according to Paul< 
Pfleiger, a junior cognitive scienc

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
A short trip can go a long way 
toward meeting new people.
According to student groups at 
CMU, short single-day or week
end trips are often wonderful 
bonding experiences that cost 
little money.
Over part of Labor Day week
end, CMU swim and diving 
team coach David Belowich took 
the groups on a camping trip led 
by the team captains. The cost 
to each team member was just 
$5 for food.
It had nothing to do with 
training; it had to do with shar
ing an experience, said
Belowich. Some people caught 
fish for the first time.
He enjoyed the campfire sto
ries and the chance to see firstyears and upperclassmen min
gling together in a way that may 
not otherwise have been avail
able. Its something everyone 
will remember. It will stick with 
them for a long, long time, said 
Belowich.
Not all events need to be off 
campus, though, in order to 
bring people together. Circle K 
finds that something as simple 
as a Blockbuster night pro
vides a means for people to get 
together on a more informal 
basis and spend time that is not 
to the organizations
aims. Sarah Castaldo, a junior 
information and decision sys
tems major, said that while service-related activities take
members off-campus, most
purely social events happen 
within CMU.
Since before classes began, 
RAs across campus have been 
organizing events for their 
floors ranging from dinner and 
movie parties to adopting ani
mals at the zoo.

business administration major 
and RA in Resnik Hall,,

Experiences
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Whether it be navigating angry 
rapids or sprucing up old playgrounds, 
members of many of CMUs student 
organizations are forming lasting 
bonds as a result of shared experiences 
away fi-om campus.
Walking from building to building at 
CMU, one cant help but notice the 
fliers plastering the bulletin boards, 
encouraging students to join this, that, 
and the other thing. And while the 
activities themselves are enticing, it is 
quite possibly the lure of meeting new 
people and forming new friendships 
that makes people join.
Alpha Phi Omega, the coeducational 
service fraternity, utilizes its outings as 
an opportunity to get acquainted as 
well as help out in the community. The 
group recently took a trip to Northview 
Hills Family Center to spend the day 
building playgrounds, painting the 
perimeters of buildings, and cleaning.
Some of those who went were notice
ably shy at first.
It was a rush event, and we were 
trying to get people who were new to 
campus to get involved with us, said 
Heather Devine, a sophomore cognitive 
science major and service vice presi
dent of Alpha Phi Omega. [The] broth
ers all knew each other, and there were 
eight or nine non-brothers, some we 
knew, some we didnt.
But after a day of laborious team
work, the members of the group started 
to get acquainted.
Everyone really got to know each 
other, said Devine. It was a really nice 
day  everyone was outside, and they 
were all really happy. There were peo
ple covered in stain, and they were all 
making jokes. Everyone was definitely 
more comfortable with each other.
Julia Peoples, a sophomore electrical 
and computer engineering major and 
member of Circle K, said that commu
nity service can really bond a group 
together. On a service trip to Family
House, a facility where people can stay 
when they cant afford to stay in a hos
pital for surgery and need to be taken 
care of, many Circle K volunteers. 
became less reticent and began to be 
more open with each other.
Once we got there we were mainly 
talking to the people there, but while 
we were there, [the members] seemed 
to open up a bit more, said Peoples. I 
think [the trip] benefited the students. 
It was nice to get off of campus and! 
talk to adults and other people in the 
real world.
A white-water rafting trip, organized 
by the RAs of the fifth, sixth, and sev
enth floors of Morewood E-tower, 
offered another outlet for meeting peo-. 
pie and making friends. With the inten
tion of getting members of their floors 
to get better acquainted with each 
other, the trip served its purpose and 
turned out to be more than just a day of 
navigating rapids and being thrown 
into the water.

Fair promotes use of technology in learning
By ROSIE JONES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
CMU students, regardless of their 
majors or whether they are undergrad
uates or graduates, are required to use 
technology as a tool in their fields. 
They learn about this technology from 
courses, from their peers, and from fac
ulty. And where do faculty go to learn? 
They share expertise on using technol
ogy for education at the TechnologyEnhanced Learning Fair (TELFair).
The TELFair gives faculty the oppor
tunity to demonstrate their applica
tions of technology in the classroom. 
The exhibits include simulations, prob
lem-solving aids, and assessment tools, 
among other things. These methods 
have been applied to pre-college and 
grade school education, as well as all 
disciplines of study at CMU.
Look at the [exhibit] titles: 
HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), 
English, GSIA.... TELFair is geared 
towards the whole CMU academic com
munity and [is] a demonstration of 
what technology can do for them, said 
Michael Matessa, a graduate student 
in psychology.
The technology demonstrated at 
TELFair is generally used to supple
ment a class. For example, course mate
rial developed by a group under GSIA 
professor Paul Goodman utilizes Webbased video streams of demonstrations 
of organizational behavior. However, 
other technologies stand alone, such as 
the speech recognition and tutoring 
software for accent improvement which 
faculty member .Natalie Baker pro
duced in the School of Drama.
The accents software takes her 
knowledge and allows her to be in a lot 
of different places at the same time, 
said Matessa. It allows people who 
dont have access to her to focus on 
their accents. Its a way for everyone to 
have access to this information.
TELFair began with a symposium 
last Thursday afternoon and a panel 
discussion entitled How We Learn and 
How Technology can Enhance 
Learning and went on to the practical 
Examples: Use of Technology for 
Learning last Friday. Rangos was 
filled with hardware for this event, and 
CMU staff and faculty demonstrated 
their expertise on the marriage of edu
cation and technology.
Ben Kartzman, a junior information 
systems and HCI double major, said 
that a lot of the displays seemed to be 
based around Java applets, though a 
variety of computer-based technologies 
for education were on display. 
Kartzman, who has taken a course on 
developing educational course-ware 
online, drew ideas for his work from 
some of the exhibits at the fair.
The way [the software] runs opens 
my eyes to the sorts of things I could get 
involved in, he said. Lots of the tech
nology on display here is very practical.
CMU students taking certain under
graduate physics courses have already 
used automated physics tutors devel
oped by a group under Fred Reif, a pro
fessor in the Center for Innovation in 
Learning (CIL). Studies conducted on 
CMU students compared their grades 
in three situations: receiving assis
tance from one-on-one human tutors, 
working with the computer-based 
physics tutoring system under devel
opment, and having no' additional oneonrone assistance (the control group). 
All had access to standard resources 
including textbooks, lectures, a TA, 
and a professor.
In teaching physics, the ultimate ife 
one-on-one interaction, said Erip 
Zeisloft, an educational programmer iii 
the CIL who worked on the project 
Tutors give individual feedback anji 
individual help. In the test, the com
puter tutor system performed very 
comparably with the human tut or 3. 
The human tutors did best, but this 
was very, very close.
Donovan Lange, a sophomore in 
MCS, is a student who was required tb 
use the tutor while taking a physics 
course at CMU. It was really good fojr 
what it did, he said.
Although the fair was not as wellattended as some expected, it served its 
purpose of giving faculty, staff, and stu
dents the opportunity to spread ideas 
on how to apply technology to the 
learning process.
The role of a university is to dissem
inate knowledge, said Thomajs 
Manderfield, a staff member in 
Biological Sciences who demonstrated 
Interactive Animation of Transcription 
and Attenuation. We all bring differ
ent approaches [to using technology to 
enhance education]. This is an opportu
nity to share those approaches.

When the television program The 
Gong Show was created in the 1970s, it 
was designed so that the judges had 
the power to stop any act whenever junior civil and environmental engithey felt like it. At last Saturdays neer and organizer of the event. As a

started. In the end, 
however, the judges 
and the sisters of 
Kappa Kappa Gamma 
(KKG) proved that the 
gong is mightier than 
the siren in raising 
money for charity.
It did not take long 
after the fire drill for 
the second annual 
Kappa Kappa Gong 
Show to start. The for
mat of the show was 
similar to that of the 
television program.
There were 10 acts 
showcasing every
thing from music to 
comedy. The goal of 
those acts was simply to entertain the 
audience of about 200 people. If the act 
was poor and the audience became 
restless, the three judges took it upon

The Student Life staff tried to spice up the show with 
their act but didnt last long before the gong.
The gong was used early and often by 
the judging panel which consisted of 
Jon Zubiller, senior architecture major, 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
themselves to stop the act by ringing Affairs, and Renee Camerlengo, a staff 
the gong on stage. At the end, prizes worker in the Office of Student Affairs, 
were awarded to the best acts. The brothers of Delta Tau Delta who

which KKG donated to the MageeGonads to the beat of Rammsteins
Du Hast found themselves silenced 
by the gong. The Student Life staff who 
dressed up as the Spice Girls also 
encountered a quick ending to their act 
Spice Up Your Student Life. 
Following these two performances, the 
gong was given a rest, however.
We had a couple of quick gongs early, 
but after that, it was serious talent, 
said Murphy. All the tremendous talent 
made it very difficult for us to judge. 
One of these acts was the five-mem
ber a cappella group El Chupacabra, 
which made a one-time appearance at 
the show.
Were not a permanent group. Four 
of us are in the Sound Bytes and the 
other member is in the Originals, said 
Russell Kaplan, a junior drama major. 
We only practiced for about an hour 
[Friday] afternoon.
Despite the small amount of practice, 
El Chupacabra won the Most 
Talented award with their rendition of 
Bell Biv Devoes Poison.
Its a good song, and its got some 
good harmony to it, as well as having 
novelty to its-listeners, said Kaplan.
One of the awards, Audience Choice, 
was given to the act that received the 
most votes from the viewers. This years 
winner, sophomore English major 
Jessica Glassberg, got the most votes 
with her comedy act Jessica and Her 
Friends: A One-Woman Show. Her act 
included jokes ranging from mock adult 
film star names, to Jewish grandmoth
ers, to 80s music infomercials.
I always wanted to be a comedian, 
and I came up with jokes based on my
life, said Glassberg. I had done som| 
[stand-up] at home and at the resident 
assistant/Orientation counselor talent 
show, so now Im doing it here.
In addition to being the most popula)r 
act, Glassbergs routine also receive^ 
the award for Best Overall Act.
Some of the other awards included 
Quickest Gong, which went to Bloody 
Gonads. Music group Quiddity 
received the Most Imagination award 
for their performance of a new song 
written by the two musicians. Finally, 
the Most Entertaining Act award wen,t 
to the jazz band 29.
The people who came to watch the 
show seemed impressed with the vari
ous acts and were very animated fojr 
some of the performances.
It was just a fun show. I thought 
towards the end it got really enter
taining, said Dipesh Mukerji, a 
sophomore information and decision 
systems major.
I thought [the show] was excellent. 
Every single act made me so happyj 
said Goss. We heard only good things 
from the people in the audience.
The people at the Magee-Womens 
Hospital Breast Cancer Patienjt 
Resource Fund were probably mosjt 
pleased with the show, however. Thi:s 
was indicated by their excitement upop 
learning that they were chosen to 
receive the proceeds from this event.
Its really nice that its all for a good 
cause, said Murphy. The sisters cjf 
Kappa Kappa Gamma deserve a lot of 
praise for putting this event together 
every year.

with similar programs. If the money 
seems to fit the program, then the rep
resentative of the group goes to an 
SDC general body meeting and 
explains the trip proposal to the mem
bers. Once the members have asked 
questions and assessed the amount of 
money fit to be given, it goes into a 
vote, and if the 
request is approved, 
the group gets the 
money they have 
asked for.
Motions usually 
arent failed because 
a lot of pre-work has 
been done, said 
Jean Vettel, resi
dential programming chair of SDC and a junior 
English major. By the time you get to 
the general body meeting, youll get 
some kind of support.
Although the process for getting 
funding from SDC may seem longwinded and a little complex, most find 
it relatively effective, and very few 
groups are denied sufficient funds. 
The process can be complicated, but 
its hard to not get the money, said 
Mary Wall, a fifth-year English major
to go on off-campus trips. The experi
ential education department of 
Student Life works towards funding 
and supporting students living in res
idence halls or groups of residence 
halls who are trying to plan off-cam
pus excursions.
The experiential education depart
ment sponsors trips which foster team
There's not a set... amount that we give.
It... depends on the program, but we make 
sure the residents get what they want. 
 Jean Vettel 
SDC residential programming chair
building and communication skills 
among residents, said Dom Falso, a 
Student Life intern and senior physics 
major. We have a Web site where you 
can request an event and you get to fill 
in what youre looking to do. We can 
help you set it up.
Residents of on-campus housing are 
encouraged to seek aid and support 
from the department, as long as the 
trip that is being planned has some 
productive objective, such as floor 
and CA for Morewood Gardens C and bonding or establishing better comD Towers.
Monetary amounts given by SDC 
vary according to a multitude of differ
ent factors. Sometimes groups dont 
know the exact amount that they need, 
and in such cases SDC grants not to 
exceed amounts which allow groups 
to work within a range of costs.
Theres not a set dollar amount that 
we give, said Vettel. It always 
depends on the program, but we make 
sure the residents get what they want. 
If your event is well-planned, and 
you know the benefits of the trip, then 
youll get the money, said Katy 
Harris, an RA in Morewood E-Tower 
and sophomore business administra
tion major.
The Student Life office also plays a 
significant role when it comes to fund
ing and supporting groups who wish
munication and cooperative skills 
among students.
We want more students to come 
through experiential education to set 
up ropes courses and other kinds of 
trips, said Lewis Roberts, director of 
experiential education for Student 
Life. If someone comes to us with an 
idea for an experience with an actual 
developmental component, were more 
than willing to make it a reality.
Funding of such an off-campus 
endeavor is undoubtedly a large part 
of planning such an event, but other 
planning must go on before a trip can 
even be proposed to SDC. Julie 
Bogart, Morewood Gardens RA and 
sophomore English major, played a 
lead role in planning out the recent 
Morewood A through D Tower whitewater rafting trip. In planning for
this trip, Bogart had to call multiple 
whitewater rafting companies to get 
all the different statistics and prices 
for the programs offered.
Our best deal was an unguided 
whitewater rafting course because 
it was cheaper, so I called and made 
the arrangements, said Bogart. 
Then, Student Life decided that there 
was too much lia
bility with the 
unguided tour, so 
we had to change 
our plans.
Since nothing 
was concretely 
decided for this 
trip ahead of 
time, word about 
*** the rafting trip 
didnt even get out until a few days in 
advance. Because of this switch from 
the unguided tour to the guided tour, 
everything got to be last minute, so we 
didnt have enough time to do publici
ty, said Bogart. Since nobody really 
knew about it, nobody came, and we 
lost money.
Publicity about an event is often one 
of the main factors as far as its success 
goes. In the case of the Morewood A 
through D Towers whitewater rafting 
trip, it definitely played a large role in 
the outcome of the trip.
We didnt put up posters until 
Thursday night, and the trip was on 
Saturday at 7 am, said Anne Leete, 
Morewood Gardens RA and sophomore 
English major. Probably more people 
would have come if publicity had gone 
out sooner.
Whether or not a groups off-campus 
trip runs smoothly is generally depen
dent upon the planning and organiza
tion that a group puts into it before
hand. Although funding is generally 
not difficult to come by, it helps to get 
things set up in advance so that lastminute publicity problems and other 
glitches dont arise as the time of the 
event approaches.
There are resources for everybody, 
said Roberts. Its just a matter of 
learning to navigate the system.

sing-a-long car music and come up with 
cheers and silly, goofy stuff, she said.
The womens Ultimate team, being a 
club sport, provides the girls not only 
with an athletic outlet, but also with a 
source of meaningful friendship. These 
friendships are not limited to the play
ers own team. Pfleiger said that the 
motto of Ultimate, which states that 
the game can be played without fouls 
or referees as long as everyone obeys 
the rules, provides a basis for building 
friendships with students from other 
teams as well.
Donner admits that there is a certain 
amount of wacky hijinks that kids wil} 
play involved with the road trips that 
the runners take.
Overall, he said, the teams take their 
running and their academics seriously 
and work together to succeed at both;. 
Working hard towards a common goal 
brings us close together, said Donnexj. 
We rely on each other.
The same focus goes for those on th&

spent hanging out and catching up 06

friends, said Kerri Mills, a senior

Pfleiger told the story of a tourna
ment where CMUs team was one play
er short of the required number to play. 
The other team was the best in 
Philadelphia, but they put six players 
on the line just like us, and we played 
that way until our other players 
showed up, she said. They killed us, 
but they gave us hints on how to 
improve our game.
At the end of a game day, the hosting 
team throws a big party for all of the 
teams, which Pfleiger said unifies the 
groups and gives their members a 
chance to socialize with one another.
Varsity sports teams take their trips 
seriously. Josh Donner, a senior in 
social and decision sciences, runs for 
the cross-country and track teams. 
Most of the free time that he and his 
teammates have on road trips is spent 
either mentally preparing for the 
upcoming race or trying to keep up 
with homework. Although academic 
success is one of the things that the 
runners feel brings them together,

member. Mills also pointed out a spejcific situation when the teams vaA 
broke down in West Virginia, and the 
girls had to wait by the side of the road 
for eight hours.
It brought us closer together just 
because we were stuck there together 
for so long, she said.
It is true that athletic success is a 
direct result of hard work and dedica}- 
tion, but Carnegie Mellons athletic 
teams prove that its not always just 
about speed and strength. Success als6 
has a great deal to do with the friend;- 
ships and the chemistry between team;- 
mates. Junior civil engineering major 
and volleyball player Sarah Putaro 
summed it up when she said that 
besides a busy practice schedule and 
lots of other time commitments, the 
volleyball team almost always finds a 
way to let loose.
[Once] we Jello-wrestled against

estival brings friends together through culture
By REENA SINGHAL
' hrtan Staffwriter
In the sky the moon is round, and on 
t he ground the family is reunited. Just 
like this old Chinese saying, family 
i lembers gather together to watch the 
i loon, eat mooncakes, and spend time 
t ogether in the Chinese culture during 
1 he annual Mid-Autumn Festival.
Last Friday on the Physical Plant 
Building patio, the Singapore Student 
Association (SSA) and Awareness of 
Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) host
ed the celebration of this festival for 
t he entire campus.
We have been organizing this event 
Over since [SSA] existed, but this year 
i re decided to work together and bring it 
to the entire campus, said Weechoon 
reo, a junior electrical and computer 
i ngineering major and president of SSA.
This years Mid-Autumn Festival, 
c ne of three major traditional Chinese 
i Bstivals, falls on October 5. Each year, 
Mid-Autumn Festival falls on the fif
teenth day of the eighth month of the 
Lunar Calendar. On this day, it is
Lisette Miiler-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager

believed that the moon is brighter, 
rounder, and larger than on any other 
day of the year. According to Emily 
Chiu, a junior business major and co
president of ARCC, the holiday is cele
brated in many different countries, 
such as Singapore, China, Hong Kong,
and Taiwan, so it is a good way to bring 
many cultures together.
The celebration on campus began with 
a play by students in the two organiza
tions, enacting folklore about the secrets 
of the moon. The play was narrated in 
Chinese by Yueming Yu, lecturer of
Chinese in the Modern Language 
department, and interpreted by Ava Bai, 
a junior social and decision sciences 
major and co-vice-president of AARC.
This is a good occasion to introduce 
Chinese culture to other cultures to help 
understand each other better, said Yu.
The turnout [was] overwhelming, 
said Teo. Over 100 students came to 
celebrate the Festival on the patio sur
rounded by lit candles, hanging 
lanterns, and classical Chinese music. 
A highlight of the celebration was the 
passing out of mooncakes, round crust
ed cakes with a sticky paste inside. 
According to Yik Lin Khoo, a junior 
computer science major and vice-presi
dent of SSA, the origin of mooncakes 
for the Festival was during the Yuan 
Dynasty when notes were stuck inside 
the sticky textured mooncakes to warn 
that a rebellion would be taking place 
that day.
Back home, when we have moon
cakes, we are among family, said 
Khoo. When we are away from home, 
we have mooncakes among friends. 
Friends are family here. Everyone also
enjoyed drinking tea and trying other 
traditional Chinese foods.
Many students had fun playing and 
learning traditional Chinese games, 
such as Chinese checkers and Chinese 
chess. Weve picked up something 
new, said Mui Leng Seow, a masters 
student in software engineering. Seow 
learned and played Weiqi, an intense 
mental game similar to the Japanese 
game Go. This is my first time away 
from home on this Festival, he said.
Along the wall, riddles were posted for 
students to answer and win small 
prizes. [During the Festival], the 
Chinese people hang riddles below 
lanterns while people try to decipher 
them while admiring the lanterns and 
moon, said Khoo. Students also had the 
opportunity to make their own lanterns.
The SSA and ARCC are very thank
ful for the Senate support, without 
which this event would not have been 
possible, said Khoo.
Not enough cultural events are 
sponsored on campus, and weve decid
ed to do more of these types of cultural 
activities in the future, said Teo.
DYNAentures help students bond
DYNAMICS, from page LI
j [White-water rafting] made 
people notice that what they did 
\yas really important. There was 
definite teamwork involved, 
gaid Ligeia Richardson, sopho
more music major and an RA in 
ikorewood E tower.
i I think everybody was shy, 
said Richardson. Everybody 
ljad someone they knew  a 
friend or a roommate that they 
sjtuck to, but [they were] very
iiy in the beginning.
As the groups were forced to 
mmunicate with each other 
id work together to stay afloat, 
sting bonds began to form, 
any new friendships formed 
i the bus ride home as a result 
their shared experience.
I Tara Hannan, a first-year 
biology major, and Melissa
Stupka, a first-year student in 
H&SS, agreed that being on a 
raft with a bunch of strangers 
forced them to get acquainted.
You were under such pres
sure to work as a team [that] it 
caused everyone to bond togeth
er, Hannan said.
There was only one other girl 
on my floor who went, said 
Stupka. But we got to work a 
lot together as a group, and I 
was surprised that we really got 
to know each other.
Along with new friendships, 
many came home with a renewed 
sense of accomplishment.
Maybe you fell, maybe you 
didnt, but we all made it home, 
said Richardson.
Virginia Bond, a sophomore 
drama major and CA for 
Morewood E tower, tells a simi
lar story about the ropes course 
in Jumonsville which was used 
as a part of RA training.
There were definite groups of 
friends within the group, said 
Bond. People latched onto who 
they knew.
Due to the nature of the 
course, the trust exercises, and 
the group problem solving, peo
ple began to bond together.
People started branching out 
and looking to other people for 
new possibilities, said Bond.
Group activities provide a 
great outlet for meeting some of 
the other five thousand students 
who roam this campus on a 
daily basis. And while in most 
cases all it takes to make friends 
is some good conversation, occa
sionally a white water rapid is 
the key to lasting friendships.
Small events unite groups
EVENTS, from page LI
and cookies and watch The 
Simpsons together. These are 
popular in Resnik, he said, 
because people can come and go 
as they please.
Matt Willard, a sophomore in 
H&SS, is the RA for Henderson 
House, the wellness house at 
CMU. He and three other peo
ple recently organized a well
ness dinner for the group. They 
received $400 worth of food 
from the East End Food Co-op 
for the program. On another 
occasion, Willard invited a yoga 
instructor to teach the group for 
a couple of hours.
According to Willard, yoga, 
and even tofu at the dinner, are 
things to which some people 
havent been exposed, and this 
can be an opportunity for stu
dents to get to know each other. 
Its all about opening their 
minds, he said.
In Mudge House, RA Brian 
Tobin, a junior psychology and 
Spanish double major, has 
organized a range of different 
activities, from backrubbing 
sessions to an upcoming cosmic 
bowling trip which would cost 
only $10 per person.
Tobin said that there is a ben
efit sometimes to taking people 
off-campus as opposed to the 
mini-events in the house. Its 
taking people out of their most 
comfortable place, he said. 
According to Tobin, this can 
help people open up more, and 
most of the time the planning 
involves only a phone call.
Convenience is one of the 
decided benefits of these short
term trips as compared to 
longer ones. Castaldo said it 
was easy for her to plan a Circle 
K movie night around individu
als schedules.
Belowich expressed similar 
sentiments. Since the camping 
trip was overnight, he said, a 
lot more people were able to 
participate in it.
For each of these groups, a 
short-term trip or event pro
vided a necessary means of 
getting to know other people in 
their organization in a more 
significant way. These trips 
can happen because they are 
relatively simple to organize, 
cheap to execute, and versa
tile. The possibilities are 
numerous for a day or two of 
fun and the chance to know 
others better.

Volume 93, Issue 6The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania5 October 1998
Dark movie kicks off 
local seasonal series
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Weve all seen the standard Hal
loween films  Freddy Krueger, Ja
son, and lots of poltergeists and 
nights of the living dead. But there 
are plenty of others to choose from. 
During October, the Carnegie Mu
seum of Arts CMA Cinema will be 
showing six movies from October 
Films, a small American distribu
tion company.
[The movies] normally wouldnt 
get distributed because they are ei
ther independent or foreign, said 
Amy Wilson, assistant film and video 
coordinator at the museum. Its a 
play on words with the Halloween 
idea. Most [of the movies selected] 
are horror-type movies. Some are 
vampire films, and some are film 
noir, she said.
This past weekends film, Kiss or 
Kill, isnt likely to give-you night
mares, but the rich characters and 
sharp dialogue are enough to cap
ture anyones interest. Directed by 
Australian Bill Bennett, this 1997 
dark comedy focuses on two young 
lovers who, through their crimes, de
stroy the trust between nearly all of 
their acquaintances and, eventually, 
each other.
The film opens with a voice-over of 
the protagonist, Nikki (Frances 
OConnor): When I was growing up, 
she says, I just saw a lot of things 
that made you not trust people  
especially men, and you learn from 
that, and you just move on ... 
thats all.
The first scene shows Nikki as a 
little girl in a long white nightgown 
witnessing her mothers murder. 
The film quickly fast forwards to 
her present day life as a criminal.
L Wearing a skimpy red cocktail dress,
she seduces a businessman in a bar 
and follows him back to his hotel, 
where along with her partner A1 
(Matt Day, Muriel's Wedding), she 
kills him. For them, its routine. Its 
how they make their living, com
mitting murder and stealing from 
their victims. Eventually, the police 
catch up to them, which forces them 
to escape by way of a light-blue, 
four-door car.
But this is not an ordinary road 
trip. First, its started as a way to 
escape, and second, the nights spent 
in roadside motels rarely end without 
at least one homicide. Its never clear 
who the murderer is in this series of 
deaths  Nikki suspects Al, A1 sus
pects Nikki, and the police are able to 
follow their path of victims. As they 
drive further and further west into 
Australia, they find themselves 
pursued, and in bitter conflict with 
each other.
Both jaded, neither character is ever 
able to demonstrate sincere sympathy 
towards anyone else other than them
selves. Even though characters like 
this are often unbelievable, the ways 
in which OConnor and Day treat the 
situation through their dialogue makes 
Kiss or Kill work. In addition, Bennetts 
documentary-style camera angles and 
use of shadows add a surreal feeling to 
the film.
Horror movie lovers will be pleased 
by the CMAs upcoming films. Next is 
Michele Soavis Cemetery Man, start
ing this Saturday and Sunday. An
other Italian film, The Monster, di
rected by Roberto Benigni and Yves 
Attai, will also be playing next week
end at 9 pm immediately following 
Cemetery Man. If youre looking for 
Halloween movies besides Scream or 
1 Know What You Did Last Summer, 
be sure catch some of the CMAs Oc
tober Films.
Gallery features surreal artist
By BEHNAM FARAHPOUR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter 
& ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
Recent paintings by Valentin Lustig 
Magical realism is rarely depicted as 
humorous. Valentin Lustig is one artist 
whose style employs this unlikely com
bination. The Paintings of Valentin
ings as a whole and not a particular 
point in the painting. Each painting has 
so many elements that only the title 
specifies the objects that Lustig wants 
viewers to focus on.
Each person can make their own in
terpretation of Lustigs paintings, said 
Edith Balas, professor of art history and 
the curator of the show.
The Balcony II and The Balcony III,
Anthony DAurla/Tartan Junior Staff 
Students and visitors observed Valentin Lustigs works in the Hewlett Gallery.
Lustig, the latest exhibit at the Hewlett 
gallery, showcases 11 works, all perfect 
examples of his surrealist style.
Valentin Lustig, a Romanian native, 
moved to Israel and served in the army. 
He studied at the Academia di Belli Arti 
in Florence until 1982. He settled in 
Switzerland in 1983 and since, he has 
had group and solo exhibitions.
Thematically, many of Lustigs paint
ings convey messages of advancing in
dustrialism and the decline of tradi
tional ways, as evidenced by the paint
ings on display. Visually, Lustigs paint
ings depict mostly surreal landscapes. 
The landscapes are not the usual land
scapes, with grass and hills. Sometimes 
they are colorful, sometimes dark and 
ominous. Usually paintings have a single 
focus point, but Lustigs use of animals 
and human figures in such a small area 
brings the viewers attention to the paintwhich are visually similar landscapes, 
could be interpreted in many different 
ways. Each depict a group of nude fig
ures clustered on a balcony. It feels as if 
there are no doors to the balcony, and it 
seems that the figures are trapped. One 
of the paintings has a background of a 
industrial city with highways and street 
lights. The other has a background of a 
more conventional forest. He puts the 
two balconies in different environments 
and examines the two different worlds 
he can create.
Another feature of Lustigs works is 
his treatment of nudity. The figures in 
both balcony paintings are ambiguously 
genderless, possibly symbolizing that 
all humans are trapped equally. The 
figures are trapped together, and no 
sex is freer than the other.
The two paintings of the balcony have 
totally different backgrounds with a con
trast between the balcony and the back-, 
ground, said Holly Gabrielson, a senior; 
drama major. In The Balcony II, it; 
seems as if the people are trapped in the! 
background of an industrial society,; 
where in the other one you feel more free; 
because of the background.
Lustig uses animals to create more; 
dreamlike scenes. He uses rabbits, ducks,; 
turtles, and other animals as audiences', 
in The Power of Music. For example, in; 
The Letter Soup, he creates a scene; 
where dead fish lie on the ground, and; 
human figures fall off a ledge, while a; 
flock of ducks watch. The painting is; 
inspired by a poem by Paul Celan and is; 
an attempt to visualize a Jewish tradi-: 
tion. An enormous cat looms over the; 
whole scene, adding a surreal effect.; 
Strangely, the odd expressions make; 
the situation almost ridiculous.
Lustig creates worlds in his paint-; 
ings. With a humorous and realistic; 
feel, he makes animals walk as human,, 
traps a group of nude figures in a bal
cony. Lustig puts many elements into; 
each painting, which creates a sense of, 
curiosity about what may come next.; 
This curiosity, and the complexity of 
Lustigs paintings are what make this; 
exhibit so intriguing.

iExhibit showcases alumnus furniture

Furniture designers have the 
necessary task of giving people a 
place to put,their feet, to lean 
against, or to sit on. Often times, 
furniture is built for function, not

; $ome designers, such as William

\ A new exhibit at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art reveals an expan
sive piece of archaeological work. 
i A/i Ancient Mosaic from
were about to open its location, 
called Sepphoris, as a national 
park in 1993.
The city of Sepphoris, a Greek 
name, lay between the Mediter
ranean Sea and the Sea of 
, _ Galilee. It was prosperous and 
I fyepphoris, a collection of tiles and fertile. It was the capital of Gali
lee until the 
third century 
AD. At one 
point the 
temple was de
stroyed, prob
ably from an 
earthquake. 
The city was 
destroyed, 
then rebuilt, 
but many of the 
details of 
Sepphoris 
people and the 
enviornment 
in which they 
lived are still 
unknown.
courtesy Carnegie Museum of Art, Gabi Labon 
tyis flle depicts the Binding of Isaac, fifth century.
i>rin|[s jointly curated with the Despite the gaps in the historiPanjjlegie Museum of Natural cal record, the exhibit is a 
HistBry, is taken from a recent thought-provoking and artistic 
discovery of an early fifth cenexamination of ancient Meditertury synagogue found in Israel. It ranean history that is worth seewas found just as archeologists ing. The exhibit is divided into
eight sections of tiled flooring. 
Each of the sections of this mo
saic floor represent traditional 
beliefs and give a modern viewer 
some insight into the Jewish cul
ture in Galilee during the Roman 
and Byzantine periods. Also, they 
include explanations on the 
artifacts excavation and audio
visual and multimedia 
presentations.
The imagery of the mosaic adds 
new insight to our knowledge of 
the history of Sepphoris location 
as well as visual interpretations 
of the Old Testament. Three of 
the eight sections are directly 
related to ancient Biblical scenes, 
including the angels visit to 
Abraham and Sarah, the binding 
of Isaac, and the consecration of 
Aaron as high priest. Certain 
symbols are memorable, such as 
in the fourth panel where two 
birds hang on each side of a fruit 
basket. In the binding of Isaac, 
the picture shows the two charac
ters separated from their shoes. 
The artist, whoever designed 
these tiles at the construction of 
the temple, definitely took this 
image into account. The major 
theme of the mosaic reflects upon
the inhabitantsneed for redemp
tion, the restoration of their 
temple and the continuation of 
their rituals.
The collection of these pictures, 
even with missing tiles and muted 
colors, is very exquisite to look at. 
Some images are easily recogniz
able, even by our modern stan
dards. A section called The Zo
diac is the central and largest 
panel. One other section, which 
is separated from the rest of the 
mosaic, is a beautiful pattern 
made of the same tiles. It is hard 
to resist walking over the tiles as 
the ancient people did thousands 
of years ago.
The incomplete tiles of this aged 
artifact have an intriguing effect. 
Even if you dont think you are 
interested in art history, this ex
hibition is still worth taking a 
look at because of its sheer beauty. 
The exhibit includes explanations 
on how the artifact was exca
vated and shows a video as well 
as multimedia presentations on

Action film lacks 
sufficient story
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Forum Editor
Youve got to admire a movie 
like Ronin. It knows what it 
does best and steadfastly does 
exactly that. Under no circum
stances does it feel the least 
need to let a whiff of plot or 
character distract from the 
main attractions  car chases, 
breathtaking French scenery, 
and scruffy people mumbling 
to each other about various in
ternational intrigues. This 
makes for a confusing and dis
jointed movie devoid of all hu
man warmth. But, man, are 
there some exciting car chases.
Ronin is about a bunch of 
characters who, for some rea
son or other, are being paid a 
whole lot of money to steal a 
metal case from someone or 
other. We never do find out 
whats in the case or why its so 
important. Neither do the char
acters for that matter. What 
might be an interesting idea 
just seems like lazy filmmak
ing here. It was more than half
way through the film before it 
became clear that director John 
Frankenheimer had purposely 
left the details of the case hazy.
The characters who are try
ing to steal that pesky case are 
former agents for the CIA, the 
KGB, and assorted other clan
destine organizations. Ronin 
refers to Japanese samurai 
whose lords are killed. Since 
the Cold War has ended, these 
latter-day ronin are left with
out master or purpose and with 
no way to make their livings 
other than to hire themselves 
out as mercenaries. Most of 
them look awfully similar to 
each other, with stubbly chins 
and half-asleep eyes. Since 
were never properly introduced 
to them, and since characterization primarily consists of giv-; 
ing them different accents, I never: 
did figure out how to tell most of; 
them apart.
The nominal lead is Robert De 
Niro as an American whose knowj 
how guides the mission. You can; 
distinguish him because of his: 
New York accent. Then theres; 
Jean Reno (The Professional),', 
whose name sounds too much like j 
the Attorney Generals for me to; 
feel comfortable watching him on: 
the other side of the law, and a j 
couple of random Russians, Ger
mans, and Irishmen. Theres also; 
Natascha McElhone as the; 
groups sole female. Since she: 
didnt have much stubble on her; 
chin, it was relatively easy to tell j 
her apart from the rest.
The people exist mainly so that; 
they can take to their cars and: 
chase each other, so maybe their1 
indistinguishability doesnt mat-; 
ter all that much. The chases are; 
fast-paced and imaginatively1 
filmed. One zooms through nar
row streets in the south of France; 
and another zips through down-: 
town Paris. But since the setup; 
was so murky that I was unsure; 
why they were happening, the; 
chases lacked suspense. All I; 
could concentrate on was feeling; 
sympathy for all the poor by stand-; 
ers whose vehicles kept explod-; 
ing on impact. Really now, if you; 
insist on having a violent car; 
chase, you ought to at least have; 
enough responsibility to make; 
sure it happens on a completely; 
deserted road. The cars also kep/* 
knocking over vegetable stands; 
and running into peoples din-; 
ners at cozy little bistros. What a; 
waste of good French food. Those; 
scenes only served to remind me; 
that my money would have been; 
much better spent if, instead of; 
putting it towards my ticket to; 
see Ronin, I had saved up for a; 
nice French meal.

Henry Fool
Simon is a garbage man. If that werent bad 
enough, Simon is a garbage man who still lives at 
home with his nymphomaniac sister and druggedout mother. To make matters worse, Simon is a 
garbage man who still lives at home with his nym
phomaniac sister and drugged out mother, plus 
both men and women periodically kick his ass. But 
the truly amazing part? He doesnt appear to have 
a real problem with that. That is, until a guy named 
Henry moves in and gives Simon a notebook to 
express his real feelings. Henry is literary, charm
ing, and witty to the point of pretension. Basically, 
hes everything Simon isnt. So it follows that Henry 
is more surprised than anybody when Simon hands 
the notebook back and its filled with page upon 
page of beautifully rendered iambic pentameter 
that is so powerful it makes a mute girl sing. As 
Simon rockets to stardom in the literary commu
nity, he leaves Henry behind to deal with the gar
bage and the nymphomaniac sister and the druggedout. . . oh, you get the idea.

I couldnt say this at any school, but I think its safe 
to say that at CMU everyone knows someone like 
Max, the protagonist in this film. He doesnt go out 
very much. Talking to the woman down the hall 
-scares him. He spends all of his time in front of his 
'computer, trying to get it to run impossible programs 
and then getting frustrated and abusing it when the 
programs dont work. The one big difference between 
Max and the guy you know? Max isnt playing Quake; 
hes trying to unlock the secrets of the universe. After 
ten years of trying, Max thinks he might be onto 
something when one of his programs may or may not 
tell him Gods name, not to mention how to pick 
winners in the stock market. Everyone from Jewish 
scholars to large brokerage firms try to woo him, 
while still leaving room for the possibility that hes 
just a paranoid delusional.

The Big Hit
I dont like to stereotype actors. I prefer to see 
them try out different personas, as long as its 
within the realm of reason. Thats why I have no 
problem with Marky Markplaying a polite contract 
killer named Melvin Smiley. And yes, its a little 
hard to picture Richie Valenz (Lou Diamond Phillips) 
as one of his macho partners, but I say more power 
to him. I can even sort of see Captain Sisko from 
Deep Space Nine (Avery Brooks) as their stylish 
and charming crime boss. But, I defy anyone to sit 
there and tell me that Kelly Bundy (Christina 
Applegate) can play a convincing Jewish fiance 
from Brooklyn.

Slap Shot
Okay, whats going on with the Sunday night 
movie? When I first got here the films were totally 
bizarre campfests that only Jon Waters could love. 
They had a very small, very scary, following and we 
liked it that way. But Slap Shot? Its the classic 
Afternoon Movie about the small town hockey 
team that finds out that violence and vulgarity are 
effective strategies to winning their games. There 
comes a point when tradition should mean some
thing. I mean, it stars Paul Newman, for Gods sake!

With the addition of a new trombone player, 
the band is solid and better than ever. Fans 
of LTJ will not be disappointed with their 
latest release. Catchy choruses, high energy, 
and upbeat music are what make this album 
really shine. The only gripe, as always with 
LTJ, is that the horns sound flat in the 
recording. Engineer guru Steve Kravac, of 
MxPx fame, did not help make the horns 
sound any better than on their other re

moe.
Tins Cans and Car Tires  Sony 550 Music
If you havent heard of them, moe. is a rock 
band from Utica, New York. They took their 
name from a Louis Jordan tune, Five Guys 
Named Moe, which was the bands original 
name when it formed in 1991. There are a 
variety of other musical elements blended 
into moe.s brand of rock, including funk, 
reggae, country, and jazz, but for the most 
part the sound is straight rock and roll.
Tin Cans and Car Tires is moe.s second 
album on a major label. They released 
indie and live CDs before signing to Sonys 
550 Music. Much of their fan base has been 
built from touring, and they have a repu
tation as a jam band along the same lines 
as Blues Traveler, Phish, and the Grateful 
Dead. And, just as the Grateful Dead had 
its deadheads, moe. has a loyal group of
self-proclaimed moe.rons.
On this new album, moe. sounds a lot like 
the Grateful Dead, except with more of a 
hard rock edge. Its obvious that they are 
talented musicians, because their reputation 
as great live performers translates very well 
into the studio, which cant be said about all 
bands. They have invited a host of other 
musicians to perform with them, adding 
horns, strings, and piano to the mostly guitar-driven rock. However, the sound starts to 
get old as the album wears on. Many of the 
songs, such as in the opening track, Stranger 
than Fiction, feature Phish-esque vocals that 
become repetitive. The songs are okay, but 
not really special.
All of this would make for a less-thanaverage album if the songs werent so ener
getic. The cheeriness makes the otherwise 
forgettable songs catchy and worth a listen.
- ROB CULLEN
So if youre into jam bands, you should 
probably check out moe. when they come to 
Metropol on Thursday, October 29. Tickets 
are $10 in advance, $13 the day of show, and 
can be purchased by calling 261-2232.
DJ Spooky
Riddim Warfare  Asphodel
Coming two years after Songs of a Dead 
Dreamer, DJ Spookys second full-length al
bum, Riddim Warfare, is a welcome listen. 
With guests such as Sonic Youths Thurston 
Moore and Brazilian experimentalist Arto 
Lindsay, the album is a showcase of the often 
confusing genre known as illbient: a cross 
between ambient, trip-hop, hip-hop, 
breakbeat, jazz, and experimental.
ever-changing world of urban nightlife, with 
its sheer variety of sounds. Some of the tracks 
suffer from want of original beats; three of 
them, including the title track, use the same 
drum sample, bringing an air of drudgery 
into the mix.
While its genre-bending and monotony de
tracts from the overall impact of the album, 
the work is a significant step ahead for Spooky.
- ROB JEFFERSON
Soul Coughing
El Oso  Slash
If this album were from any band but Soul 
Coughing, it would be amazing. Its musically 
interesting, upbeat, and has some damn fine 
lyrics. But for a band that made its reputation 
on persistent hip-hop grooves and lead singer 
M. Doughtys clever, poetic lyrics, El Oso is a 
bit of a disappointment. Though it contains 
some worthy songs, it lacks the narrative 
coherence of earlier efforts.
Warfare conducts itself at an eccentric pace 
 hip-hop tracks such as Object Unknown 
(featuring vocals by Dr. Octagons Kool Keith) 
mix themselves in with avant-garde jazz 
works such as Quilombo Ex Optico. At the 
same time, Spooky brings together off-kilter 
breakbeat/rap, as in the title track, Riddim 
Warfare, and noisy trip-hop, as in 
DialecticalTransformations III. The album 
seems to have no clearly delineated design, 
which evokes images of the fast-paced and

is a more obvious use of keyboard sampler] 
Mark De Gli Antonis skills. Bassist Sebastian 
Steinberg and drummer Yuval Gabay keep a

Overall, despite its shortcomings and the

El Oso is a quality album. Fans expecting

their expectations, but those who appreciate

FURNITURE, from page L13
sions all over the East Coast, as 
well as dozens of collections in 
museums, universities, and cor
porations. He has designed pieces 
for Eastman Kodak, the Ameri
can Craft Museum, and the Uni
versity of Rochester. In addition, 
he was also comissioned to de
sign a coffee table for the Presi
dent of the Johnson Wax Corpo
ration, and to re-design a law 
firms entire office, which 
exemplifes the variety of work he 
is capable of doing.
For Furniture and Sculpture, 
Keyser chose some pieces that 
are representative of his vary
ing work. In the UC Gallery, a 
large coffee table with a unique 
curved shape stands in the cen
ter of the room. Another piece, a
tall music stand, is embellished 
with graceful wooden supports. 
Keyser has also designed much 
larger pieces of public furniture. 
The exhibit shows scaled ver
sions of two 30-foot-long sub
way benches he created for the 
Massachusetts Bay Transpor
tation Authority.
Keysers exhibit is a chance for 
students to see work by an artist 
trained in the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. This combination 
of science and art had many stu
dents interested.
I enjoyed looking at the differ
ent aspects of his sculptures and 
furniture and how he took a dif
ferent approach in interpreting 
familiar objects, said David Del 
Rosario, a first-year design major.
Keysers artwork shows stu
dents that art can be found in 
many places. His sculptures have 
a universal appeal and are placed 
in a variety of locations  every

National Sweetest Day. It just doesn't make sense. Maybe 
it's the Valentine's Day of the second half of the year. 
They could have made it easier on all of the card makers, 
though. I mean, if it was National Sweetheart's Day 
then they would just need to change all of the "valentines" 
on the cards to "sweethearts." Instead, if you want the 
cheap way out, then you would end up saying something 
like, "Be my sweetest." Sweetest isn't even a noun. Of 
course, creating a new card from scratch for another person 
demonstrates undying and eternal love, and that's reason 
enough to create such a holiday. The thing is, this isn't a 
famous holiday. It probably all started when some lonely 
kid in a dorm room sat at his computer and sent out a for
ward reminding everybody to celebrate National Sweetest 
Day The funny thing is that it takes place the day after 
National Boss's Day. Maybe the two holidays are mutually 
exclusive. Too bad. Now you can't date your boss.

It is terribly easy to pick a theme, but when it comes to writing about 
it, the theme becomes a difficult, stubborn child. Water was easy; 
things flow. Everything flows, water, history, time  heck, even the 
universe itself. But Earth, is well, harder. This issue of Dossier brings 
together many found-images, creating a very textured, dirty feel.
With the writings, we aimed for the visceral.
We expected work about foundations or being grounded, for 
example, families or communities or working, and we were impressed 
by four poems that fell along those lines. There was Jill Khourys 
Reliquary, with Mike McCurdys layered design that includes a pic
ture of the Earth from space. We also chose Nicole Cooks excuses, 
featuring Nina Venkateshs very dark design that mirrors the dark rela
tionship in the poem. Dave Elmans Banana Republic, designed by 
Laura Wetzel, is one of two community poems in this issue. Bhumika 
Muchhalas Pohkran was the other. Mike Zimmer creates a very tex
tured feel by using vernacular images.
Other writers decided not to present Earth so metaphorically. 
The diction of Adam Ratanas untitled piece includes words like roots, 
ground, earth, and dig. Julie Bogarts The Winter of Man, has a 
fatalism as solid as the Earth. Catholic School Boys portrays the 
eternal problems of teenagers and Catholic education. We found 
metaphors for distance and travel in Donovan Chases l"=200mi. 
echoed through global imagery by KC Cheung. Separation and dis
tance appear again with Lee-Anne Stossells visceral images of a body 
and a car in Maureen McGranaghans The Good Samaritan.
Even the paper between your fingers represents Earth. Take 
care of it. Read slowly. Savor the good parts. Avoid paper cuts.

Yellow fruit stamps the face, eyes 
catch labor in the creases. Banana 
stalks blacken the cheeks and the flesh gathers 
in sagging lips. Sweat epoxies linen 
to dark skin, yellowed teeth sway 
like crumbling gravestones. Workers pitch 
stems into trucks, their shoulders weathered 
from years of hauling.
Enriqu flips the coin, banana 
fading into the dull sheen, 
and the lights blurt a final hiccup.
The plantation has eight-hour 
days, darkness thrown in for four.
The faucet drips in time with snores 
of the children. Stained brown 
porcelain and blood on the pillow.
They are lucky. Water is a luxury.
The workers live under the flag 
of Banana. Banana schools. Banana 
housing. Banana stores. Governments 
crumble when Banana is angry. Banana 
sanctions rail and ship movement. Banana 
keeps them alive.

he Winter of Man
JULIE BOGART
If winter were a man,
I'd tell him to go to hell.
I'd show him my dried-out, aking skin, 
aged beyond my years and 
my statically electri ed hair, 
no longer in my control.
I'd tell him about the shivers
that wrack my body when he's near and the coldness 
that numbs my limbs and my heart 
when he touches me.
I'd demand to know why he strips the world, my world 
of its color, its youth, and its love.
He'd stare coldly at me, silent 
and I'd know, had known all along, 
winter can't hear me 
he can't feelHe chills, numbs, and ruins.
I'd turn my back on him,
but the memory of his stare would
freeze my insides.

Honesty is enforced by satellite. People said the birthmark on my arm looked like Panama but until the CIA analysts got the ultrazoomed telescopic split screen in front of my eyes... well, I never would have believed.

stopped. I was cut off by the sound of a siren . A cop was signal
ing me to pull over and, I realized, at a very bad time. No doubt, 
the girl saw this policeman as her savior, though it only took me a 
moment to figure out he was following us because of my speed 
(my foot had gotten heavier in my excitement) and possibly 
because he'd seen us swerve.
"Oh, no,'1 I said. I kept driving, even sped up for an instant 
involuntarily. That evoked an anguished and half-stifled "No!" 
from my companion who probably thought I intended to make 
this a chase, unwilling to give up my abductee so easily.
However, I immediately took my foot off the gas and changed 
lanes in preparation to pull over. I hoped she would take this as 
evidence that I had no criminal intentions, though I knew she was 
no longer thinking rationally.
"Listen," I said, as I pulled over onto the shoulder. "I had no 
intention of kidnapping you." Once I'd stopped the car, I glanced 
in the mirror to see the cop pulling over behind me and then 
turned to face her. "I only wanted to take you to lunch." I realized 
that it sounded like a fabricated story, something you would feed 
a child whom you wanted to keep a secret. I faced forward again, 
smiled, and shook my head. She was watching me with an ugly 
expression, no longer terrified but loathing. Her endearing gulli
bility was going to get me in trouble unless I could somehow 
make her understand in the next few seconds. I have a weird 
sense of humor," I started to say only to be interrupted by the 
cop, knocking on my window. I rolled it down.
"Officer!" the girl yelled. I tried to cut her off.
"Officer," I said calmly, we need to get this girl to a gas sta
tion. Her car ran out of gas a ways back."
He's not taking me to the station!" she half sobbed. We 
keep passing exits, and he won't stop!" The cop peered into the 
car, looking past me at her. I looked over myself and saw that her 
make-up, a little mascara, maybe some blush, was running. The 
evidence was damning. I turned back to the cop, a middle-aged 
man with a sun-tanned face slowly accumulating lines. He was 
probably a father. For a long moment, he was silent. Then he 
said quietly,
Please step out of the car. I complied willingly because I 
had no choice. The cop walked me away from the car and asked 
me to perform a few tasks to prove I wasn't drunk. He made all 
his requests in a perfunctory, impersonal voice, and I did not offer 
any explanations.
"I pulled you over for speeding," he said when we were fin
ished. "And because I saw you swerving all over the road. I'm 
still considering whether or not to take you to the station for a 
breathalyzer test. For the moment, however, I'd like you to please 
return to your car while I speak to the young lady.
"Officer, I haven't been drinking, and I really did intend to 
take the girl to a station," I explained. "She said she was on her 
way to the airport, and I thought I might drive her there.
Mmm-hmm," he muttered. Now if you could just wait here and 
give me the keys, please, we'll be right back." He beckoned to the 
girl who climbed out of the car obediently. I stole a look at her as 
she got out and saw that she'd wiped off the makeup and tears, 
leaving her eyes only faintly puffy.
I felt humiliated and also exasperated by the fact that the cop had 
taken my keys. It deprived me of the opportunity to show I was 
innocent by not leaving the scene. Watching them converse a lit
tle distance from the car, I wondered what they were saying, what 
she was telling him. I thought of my wife, probably back at work 
now, and how shed have to come and drive me home from the 
station and probably pay for the car, which they would tow. I just
barely managed to keep from laughing (which probably wouldn't 
have helped my case much). The truth is I love to inconvenience 
her because she behaves so ridiculously in the face of small 
Inconsequential distractions. I've tried to imagine how she would 
deal with a real problem, complaining in the midst of some disas
ter about having to leave the office. I had married a driven and 
somewhat petty woman, but I enjoyed her pettiness as much as 
anything else about her. In fact, I provoked her irritation just to 
witness her charming disregard for all the important things. We 
would never have children and therefore never a daughter who 
would run out of gas on the interstate and need the help of a 
stranger. I reflected on this a moment and felt something odd.
I'd been having fun at the girl's expense, frightening her because 
I enjoyed her naivete, her girlish fear. But I'd always intended to 
do the right thing; in fact, I was willing to pay for her gas, buy her 
lunch, drive her anywhere she needed to go. I was willing to do 
anything for her if she would just spend a few minutes with me, 
give me a moment of her charming youthful sincerity. Leaning 
back in my seat, I suddenly realized that I had, in fact, been kid
napping her, kidnapping her for harmless reasons and only for a 
little while but kidnapping her nonetheless. And it was then that I 
realized I didn't even know her name. She was nameless to me, 
as victims always are to their perpetrators. But I wasn't a perpe
trator. 1 was a harmless stupid middle-aged man with a strange 
sense of humor that I had to stop indulging to the detriment of 
other people. She would probably never trust a stranger again, 
and while this might keep her out of trouble, it was also going to 
deprive her of,friends or at least benefactors.
They were approaching the car now, and with them the moment 
of truth. I certainly wasn't going to confess what I'd been think
ing; that was a personal realization for my personal files. How 
could I tell the officer: yes, I was abducting her but only to drive 
past a few exits and maybe take her to lunch? All the kidnappers 
who'd come before me with their true malice and terrifying cun
ning had doomed me. Anything I said could be used against me. 
The girl had her arms crossed and she walked right past me with 
her head down, proceeding on to the officer's car. The officer 
himself leaned in my open window.
"I'm going to have to ask you to get out," he said. Again, I 
complied, ready to hear my rights and to avail myself of the right 
to remain silent, my only defense now.

the limits of our patient mother
the people of Pokhran do not know anything 
about the effects of nuclear radiation 
they do not know how our mother will take its vengeance, 
not on the ones who push the buttons, but on the ones 
who live in homes of red clay and eat 
long grains of light brown rice
how completely her rage will swallow the air that you breathe?' 
how far are you willing to run when it unfolds?
the people of Pokhran have nowhere to run: 
there are no words in their language 
for 'nuclear' and 'bomb'
their language could never have imagined such holocausts
such diabolic mutations of power
sunlight drips down in occasional streaks, aching 
in forced restraint because it is not being 
allowed through the gray ceiling

RELIQUARY
I.
I saw it on tv when I was eight.
The white light of a womans dying 
flickered through the tube and threw 
a jaundiced glow on our rug. Was it 
that way for you, smoothly cocooned 
in a white winding sheet, machines 
attending to the rhythms of your body?
You thought the cameras lens 
would steal your soul, so there is no 
photograph with it s glossy surface 
mottled by thumbtacks and childrens 
fingerprints. The remembered shreds 
of your voice cant be pressed 
between the pages of a Bible.
So what is left of you on this earth?
II.
The square angles of you in your uniform and hat, 
driving a fancy cab. Your Good morning maam 
staccato through front teeth. Your startled jump 
and over-the-shoulder glance at the sudden 
anxiety of a church bell.
Your quiet step to the garage under 5am sky.
The dark moons of your fingernails as you ripped 
the sparks from my mothers car. Hungarian curses 
making leafy patterns in the air, you sounded 
out words like adultery and divorce.
The bed with the bars on the sides, enclosing you 
like an infant. Your eyes, crinkled with glee 
at the attention. My mother appraising 
your body through the oxygen tent.
I taped a penny to the rail for luck, 
but it wasnt enough.

about the flight and the friend and how an incident such as this 
made her look.
"You'll have a good laugh over this when you get there," I 
remarked, hoping to make her blush again. But she didn't oblige 
me; instead her brow furrowed.
I suppose. It's my father, and I hope he won't be angry."
"Did you think you could make it on what you had? I asked, 
dispensing with my teasing.
"What do you mean?"
"In the gas tank."
"Oh, I don't know."
"You just forgot to check?" For someone who had just run 
out of gas, she was curiously unconcerned about fuel. She 
glanced out the window every few moments and fidgeted with 
her hands.
I never even thought about it, she said, after a pause. 1 
don't drive much, and so I just didn't think of it."
I laughed. She was even more charmingly innocent and 
foolish than I had hoped. I tried to imagine my brisk, business
like wife doing something like this (perhaps she had as a teenag
er, in which case I wish I had been there to see it). If this girl had 
a boyfriend, she'd do well not to tell him. The incident would 
define her forever.
"Do you have a boyfriend?" I asked her. The question was 
probably a bad idea, for it startled her. She didn't answer for a 
moment, and I realized she was trying to think of the best answer, 
as if the answer would somehow affect my behavior. Apparently, 
she didn't trust me enough to tell the truth because the truth in 
this situation is a relatively simple matter. Either you have a 
boyfriend or you don't.
"Yes," she finally said. I thought she might say more; she 
looked ready to elaborate, but then she turned to the window and 
exclaimed,
Here's the exit!" I drove right past, and she froze. Glancing 
over, I could see her shoulders tense.
"Nothing there," I said.
"But I saw a station," she protested.
Well, we'll get the next one. I'm sorry. I wasn't in the right 
lane." It was true; I was in the center lane, but no one was in our 
way. There were very few cars on the parkway at all today, and I 
could have gotten right over. She stared out the window blankly.
"My Dad will be wondering where I am," she said, perhaps 
as a sort of warning.
"Well get you there. In fact, I can even drive you to the 
airport." Forget my wife, I decided. She'd wait exactly ten min
utes at the restaurant and then leave. 1 wouldn't see her until late 
that night when she would come home and, after checking to see 
that I was in bed and supposedly asleep, raid the kitchen. She 
was a late-night binge eater, a habit I found disgusting. It caused 
her to gain weight too, which no one could understand because if 
I took her to a restaurant, she inevitably ordered a salad. "I'll 
even take you to lunch," I told the girl. "On me."
No, that's all right, she said quickly. Just drop me off at 
the next exit. I'll be fine. I'll call my mother. She was playing
with her hair, running her hands through the bangs that hung on 
her forehead. Then she rubbed her legs just above her knees. I 
drove past another exit.
"You're not going to drop me off?" she asked, plaintively and 
with no attempt to hide her agitation. She was a moment away 
from tears.
The airport's not far, I replied, though I had not yet decided 
I was going to take her there. I was beginning to wonder if that 
was a fabrication, to bring up her father and the fact that he 
expected her.
Please, you don't have toRelax. I have nothing to do today. In fact, you've saved me 
from a boring lunch.
She grew silent, but her every movement spoke now. She 
bit her bottom lip and adjusted her seat belt. Between her 
spasms of fidgeting, she tried to remain still if only for a moment, 
trying to convince me of her composure.
"No one's going to miss you for a little while," I remarked.
"But his flight - his flight is here," she said, stumbling. "It's 
here, now."
"Then maybe we shouldnt stop for lunch," I murmured.
"What?" She could not pretend composure even in her 
speech now. We just missed another exit. Did you say we are 
not going to stop?"
It would be risky. People would see you with me." I was 
trying not to laugh. I wanted her to take me seriously, just for a 
moment. Instantly, she came to tears.
"Oh, God, please let me out!" She sat forward in her seat 
and then surprised me by pulling the handle of her door. I heard 
the door unlatch and, fearing it would open at sixty miles an hour, 
I leaned across her to grab the handle.
"You can't do that!" I yelled. The car swerved as I pulled the 
door tight. I returned to the driver's seat then to get it under con
trol. Meanwhile, the girl was trembling and screaming.
Oh my God, someone please help me!" She rolled down 
her window and shouted "Help!" to the air and the other passing 
cars.
"They can't hear you," I said, and now I couldn't help laugh
ing. The very sight and sound of this girl screaming out of my 
car for help on the parkway filled me with mirth. It reminded me 
of my nieces -1 have three, all between the ages often and fifteen
- and their high pitched voices, giggling and arguing whenever I 
take them anywhere. The noise irritates my wife, who snaps at 
them (even though they are her sister's children), but I love it, 
their youthful humor and inconsiderateness, their self-conscious 
melodrama. They would scream for help just for fun, to make a 
scene. The girl beside me, however, had no companions. She 
thought she was alone with a lunatic, and when I glanced at her, I 
found she was staring at me in horror. I sobered and shook my 
head, taking a moment to compose myself.
"It's all right, I said. "Nothing to be afraid of. We passed a 
sign indicating that the next exit would come up in a few miles. 
"There. We'll get off at that one.
Where are we going?" she whispered. Her face was white.
What do you mean where are we going? To a gas I

---------------------------------------------------

I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't mean to frighten you." She slow
ly turned and looked at me, and then, as I stared at her through 
the window, she blushed. She actually blushed because the situ
ation, embarrassing to begin with, was becoming more ridiculous 
by the minute. The blush encouraged me; I saw the key to win
ning her, and i set about pushing the absurdity to a new level. I 
removed my blazer (my wife likes me to dress for lunch) and 
turned all the pockets inside out, revealing their emptiness and 
the absence of weapons. (I never wear that blazer except when 
I'm required to do so. I can't believe I had it on that day in the 
car; usually I wait until Im outside the restaurant). Then I dug 
into the pockets of my pants and reached down all the way to the 
bottom, grasping the material and yanking it out. These pockets, 
however, unlike the ones on my coat, were full of items, which, 
according to my plan, came spilling out. I feigned consternation 
when I saw my change all over the ground and also a few butter
scotch candies and a crumpled score sheet from my latest round 
of golf. I bent down in the wet gravel and mud to retrieve them, 
and thereby achieved my desired end. She opened the door and 
stooped to help me, apparently convinced that any man who 
would spill the contents of his pockets was trustworthy.
I must have left my gun at home," I said. She started but 
then caught my jovial grin and smiled. "Now how about that 
ride?" I pressed.
Are you sure-"
"Absolutely positive. I can't just leave you here, can I?"
I got up, stuffed my belongings back into my pockets and 
rubbed my hands together to take care of any dirt and bits of 
gravel.
"Ready? I asked. She was putting on a back pack, the little 
school girl.
"Yeah."
I led the way back to my car, and she got in the passenger 
side, placing her backpack on the floor at her feet and buckling 
her seat belt.
All set?" I asked. She nodded. It was very quiet in the vehi
cle, the way it always is when you're about to go somewhere with 
someone you don't know very well. I turned the key, and the wel
come noise of ignition greeted us. As we joined the line of traffic, 
I saw her lean towards the window and look back, as if to catch a 
last glimpse of her own car behind us.
"Don't worry. You're going to see her again, I promised.
She looked over at me and smiled a little.
I just wanted to make sure it was safe to merge." There 
were not any cars close to us, either in front or behind, but I ah'ed 
and accepted this excuse.
"So where were you off to just now?" I asked. Maybe she 
had to get somewhere by a certain time. I hadn't thought of that. 
It was June, so school was not in session.
"I'm going to the airport," she replied.
"To the airport! Do you have a flight to catch?"
"No, I'm picking someone up." She looked at her watch.
"The flight is probably just getting in now."
"Will they wait? I asked.
What else can they do? Her resignation struck me as out 
of character. Someone like her, I thought, would be all worried

---------------------------------------------------

We only got a small serving 
of guilt, us public school kids 
We put in our Saturday mornings 
from eight to fifteen and grandmothers 
took our pictures when we finished 
We laughed at the priest 
who wanted to drill us in the basics:
How many times, can you genuflect 
in less than thirty seconds?
How fast can you cross yourself 
before you get the order wrong?
They got it all  priests in the schools, 
bitter lay teachers living on $14,000 a year 
We said: If you want to raise a child with morals, 
keep them the hell away from Catholic school. 
That was the wonderful thing about Catholic 
school boys. They lived on sin, drank sin, ate sin, 
got dressed in sin in the morning.
Or wanted to. You want romantics?
Talk about the boy with auburn hair 
and a volume of Camus in his coat pocket.
At seventeen that seems like a lot.
I was the kind of girl he could
get out his brit-pop over,
with a small waist . ^
and scratched-up arms.
He was the kind of boy who made 
my eyes melt.
Just enough sin to live on.
He wanted to save me and I didn't ask 
from what? for what?
I was his Queen of Darkness.
I was too beautiful and pure to touch.
Which is a*, very disappointing combination
I want to know why he believed
not wanting to fuck someone proved
he loved her. I want to find
the girl who takes that as a compliment.
I want to find the Queen of Darkness 
again, to have my Catholic 
school boys at hand 
It's so hard to be a depraved atheist.
I got a letter from the boy
who carried The Stranger in his pocket
We were nineteen  he was drunk
and in LA. I wrote back:
you're supposed to be drunk and in Boston.
He asked me to come to the coast 
We would annihilate ourselves 
with drugs and music and sin. Just 
enough sin to live on.
For just long enough. I said:
I don't think I can find the time anymore.

The Good Samaritan
by Maureen McGranaghan

---------------------------------------------------

The girl looked nervous when I drove up, not relieved as I 
had expected. After all, she was alone on this highway in the 
middle of nowhere. It was miles to the nearest anything, and she 
could not stay where she was indefinitely. I anticipated vocifer
ous thanks, but instead she hesitated before even speaking to me, 
as if she was half considering sending me on my way. She didn't 
trust me.
What can I do for you?" I asked. If I did not ask her to get in 
the car, perhaps she would understand that my motives were 
beneficent, that I was not trying to abduct her.
"Do you have a car phone?" she inquired in a small strained 
voice.
"No, don't carry one. What's the problem?"
"I'm out of gas," she said after a moment's pause (apparent
ly she didn't want to vouchsafe even this small confidence). "I 
don't know what to do. Would you stop and make a phone call 
for me?" I was surprised that she'd admitted her lack of a plan. 
She was certainly an odd combination of naivete and sophistica
tion. Her nervousness and simplicity were beginning to charm 
me, though, and I really wanted to have this girl in my car. I did
n't want to do anything to her, nothing like what she'd probably 
vaguely imagined while she'd stood in the drizzle just now, trying 
to flag someone down and half hoping they would all pass her. I 
just wanted to take her somewhere, maybe have a little talk with 
her. She would say silly things, like my wife's nieces (we didn't 
have any children ourselves), like young women in general, and I 
would enjoy that. I was in the mood for it.
"Let me tell you what," I said. "I'll drive you to a gas station, 
how about that? I promise I'm safe. And I can drive you back 
here too." I wondered if she even knew how to put gas in the car, 
if she would be all thumbs when she went to do it. That sort of 
ineptitude would make her more charming still.
"I don't want to inconvenience you," she said. She had been 
leaning down to speak to me through the window on the passen
ger side, but now she straightened and glanced back at her car, as 
if she could find an answer there to this dilemma.
Look," I said, addressing the back of her head, "if I wanted 
to kidnap you, I could have done so by now. Hey, wait!" She had 
removed her hand from the door frame and was backing up 
quickly. Apparently, she had taken my statement the wrong way.
I had only meant to reassure her by facing her concerns squarely 
and dismissing them.
I watched her run back to her car (behind mine) and get in closing 
the door and most likely locking it. Not a bad move: had I been 
dangerous that would have been a good decision. It occurred to 
me that the most rational thing to do would be to drive to the 
nearest exit and send a cop. Then she would know she'd had 
nothing to fear, and I could meet my wife for lunch as planned.
But I couldn't resist a little adventure. What if I did kidnap her 
just for a few minutes? Despite the mistake I'd just made, I still 
felt confident that I could convince her to come with me. She 
was trusting at heart, and she didn't have many alternatives (or 
any ideas). Then I would have a little fun, just a very little. I'm 
not cruel. At most I would drive past the first exit we came to, 
making her think I didn't intend to stop. She'd be charming in her 
anxiety; she was already charming in her apprehension. She did
n't know how absolutely beautiful her awkwardness and indeci
sion made her; they contrasted with everything adult about her - 
the crisp outfit she wore: khakis and a collared shirt, the touch of 
lipstick, her brown hair tied back neatly in a clip. I got out of my 
car and walked back through the drizzle to her vehicle. She was 
staring straight ahead, wide-eyed and pale. I tapped on the glass.
