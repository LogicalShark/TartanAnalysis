THE TARTAN
Commission promises to aid undergrads
By MIKE LEPPERT
Tartan Features Editor
A new committee, the Com
mission for Undergraduate Edu
cation, has been created to ex
plore and recommend ways to 
improve student learning and 
faculty teaching, both in and out 
of the classroom.
Vice-Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Erwin Steinberg 
heads the committee. The com
mission has over 50 members 
chosen from faculty, students, 
deans and associate deans, ad
ministration, and staff.
The commission met for the 
first time on Monday to review 
their goals and to choose initial 
areas of interest for exploration. 
On Wednesday, Steinberg pre
sented the commissions goals 
and task forces in conjunction 
with President Mehrabians ad
dress in the Skibo Ballroom.
Mehrabians charges to the 
commission are to improve both 
student learning and faculty 
teaching; to increase students 
skills in problem-solving, writ
ten and oral communication; 
integrating social, political and 
technical issues; and to create 
an atmosphere of scholarship 
and excitement for learningthat 
transcends the classroom.
In his addrss to the campus 
community, Steinberg said, We 
are very much interested in what 
happens in the classroom, but 
we are interested as well with 
how students spend their time 
outside the classroom. The com
mission, he says, hopes to de
crease the perception of the 
Universitys lack of concern for

University President Robert 
Mehrabian addressed the Uni
versity community on Wednes
day, in the Skibo ballroom, to 
announce both ongoing and new 
initiatives concerning the Car
negie Mellon community andits 
future. Speaking to an audience 
of about 70 students, faculty, 
and staff, he pinpointed five is
sues of concern: his perspectives 
and actions toward improving 
undergraduate education, in
cluding the introduction of Dr. 
Erwin Steinberg, vice-provost of 
undergraduate education; the 
need to increase the intema-The freshman 3D Design class presented their projects made out of

special advisory boards to assess 
the quality of each University 
department and suggest im
provements; the reassessment 
and adjustment of the Carnegie 
Mellon Action Program (CMAP); 
and the recognition of the Fifth 
Year Scholar Program.
Mehrabian began by acknowl
edging the continued excellence 
and recognition of the Uni
versitys graduate programs. 
However, he noted that Carn

grams have not shared the same 
vitality/and that the support and 
growth of undergraduate educa

has appointed Dr. Erwin 
Steinberg, Thomas S. Baker, 
Professor of English and Inter
disciplinary Studies and former 
dean of H&SS, as the vice-provost for undergraduate educa
tion.
We needed to have someone 
in a very high office in this insti

have only one thing on the 
agenda  what is best for our

is best for our undergraduate

Several adjustments have 
been made to Student Senates 
fiscal policy. Specifically, the 
Funding and Recognition 
Committees (F&R) authority 
has been redefined; a formal 
definition of probation has been 
set; and Senate has reserved 
the right to override the fiscal 
policy.
In the past, an organization 
would ask for funding or recog
nition and, even if F&R rejected 
their proposal, Senate would 
vote on the issue and pass or 
reject it, rendering F&R practi
cally powerless. This policy was 
changed by requiring that any 
business brought before F&R 
shall require a majority vote to 
be brought before Senate as a 
motion under special business.
Clubs and organizations will now 
have to take F&R seriously.
 Chris Neighbor 
_______________________Senate chair
There are two ways by which 
an organization can still reach 
Senate if rejected by F&R: they 
can ask a Senator to bring the 
issue up in the next Senate 
meeting as a motion, or they 
can get a petition. The change 
nonetheless gives F&R more 
power within Senate.
Senate decided to define pro
bation in their fiscal policy af
ter running into problems last 
year with the Association for 
Life (AFL.), a recognized orga
nization. AFL was cited for an 
Andrew electronic bulletin 
board message which encour
aged readers to telephone 
Planned Parenthood hotlines 
in order to cost Planned Par
enthood money and reduce its 
volume of business. AFL was 
also cited for hanging offensive 
posters which included Nazi 
, symbolism. The group was 
1 placed on probation by a 13-5 
Senate vote, and Senate this 
established the precedent for 
its probation policy. Probation 
is not financially related, but 
was placed in the fiscal policy 
because it falls under F&Rs 
authority and the fiscal policy

Student Senate has voted to 
override its fiscal policy and 
partially fund Kappa Alpha 
Thetas Mr. Fraternity char
ity event. Senate promised to 
provide $810, which has been 
earmarkedfor lighting, contes
tants tuxedos, and stage and 
safety expenses. Other funds 
will come from the sororitys 
budget, and outside donations.
Senate is helping fond the 
event for the benefit of the cam
pus. We try to support a num
ber of special activities for the 
students here, including Mr. 
Fraternity, said Funding and 
Recognition Chair Terrel Dean. 
Theta sister Amy Johnson said, 
The money is more or less for
any campus security we need 
to put this thing on.
The fundraiser supports the 
Karen Johnson Fund for 
Asthma Research for the Cen

New Carnegie Science Center dazzles visitors
Cesar Sanchez/Tartan Photographer
By MIKE KUNSMANN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Science Center (CSC) 
opened its doors to the public on Satur
day, exactly two years after the 
ground-breaking ceremonies.
This $40 million facility is located on 
Pittsburghs North Shore, and is de
signed to educate, entertain, and in
spire the audience through exhibits and 
programs in science and technology.
The opening-day activities com
menced at 9:30 am with a parade from 
the CSC Allegheny Square Annex (for
merly the Buhl Science Center) to the 
new Carnegie Science Center. The rib
bon-cutting ceremonies were held from 
11:15 am to noon, when the front doors 
were opened to the sound of the 
riverboat horns from the entire Gate
way Clipper Fleet. Clowns, jugglers, 
robots, and marching bands were also 
on hand to celebrate the opening .
We are delighted to have received 
such strong support for the Science 
Center, said Robert C. Wilburn, presi
dent of The Carnegie. Local corpora
tions, individuals, foundations, the City 
of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
have all helped to make this possible.
Our goal is to give visitors concrete 
experiences with advances in science 
and technology, and at the same time 
illustrate how the principles of science 
apply to the world around them, said 
Alphonse Desena, director of The Car
negie Science Center.
There are many different attractions 
at the CSC. TheRangos Omnimax The
ater offers a sight and sound experi
ence that makes Pittsburgh the 13th 
city in the country that has this attrac
tion. The audience is seated on tilted 
seats and surrounded by a vast, domed 
screen. This is the largest film frame in 
motion picture history, and the audi
ence experiences a special sound sys
tem that makes the air tremble.
I have been to an Omni theater and 
it is definitely a really wild experience 
that should not be missed, said Michael 
Artman, a H&SS freshman.
Another major attraction is the Sci
ence Way. It illustrates scientific prin
ciples within common objects and 
events. Containing two houses, a park, 
and a mechanics shop, visitors learn to 
understand phenomena found in their 
daily lives.
Other sights to see include a water 
sculpture, a World War II diesel-elec
tric submarine, a special exhibition on 
sports, a planetarium, and much more.
This new science center is now the 
fifth component of The Carnegie, join
ing the Library of Pittsburgh, the Mu
seum of Art, the Museum of Natural 
History, and the Music Hall. The CSC 
is located on the Ohio River near Three 
Rivers Stadium, and it shares parking 
with the stadium. This makes it more 
accessible to the visitors.
Science is a vital part of the world 
today, said John D. Rangos, Sr. The 
Carnegie Science Center and the 
Omnimax Theater are part of a new era 
in Pittsburgh, an era of high technol
ogy. This complex is going to influence 
young men and women for generations 
to come, and it gives me great hope for 
the future to see so many young people 
excited about science and technology.
An Andrew Carnegie look-alike appeared 
at the Science Centers opening parade.

Students protest U.S. sanctions
By RICHARD 
KWIATKOWSK3
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
A demonstration protesting 
U.S. sanctions against Iraq was 
held outside Skibo on Friday, by 
Vincent Eirene and the Pitts
burgh Students for Peace. The 
demonstration was intended to 
raise the awareness on campus 
about the weapons systems de
veloped by CMU, according to 
Erin Bush, a University of Pitts
burgh senior philosophy, politi
cal science, and economics ma
jor, and member of the Pitts
burgh Students for Peace.
The demonstration featured 
four speakers and a mainstream 
video by Bill Moyers which fo
cused on how the United States 
created Saddam Hussein by back
ing the Iran-Iraq War.
The first speaker was CMU 
English professor, Dave Demarest. Demarest spoke out in sup
port of the demonstration, citing 
that CMU is an apathetic cam
pus politically. Demarest also 
said that the mission of educa
tion is not to be non-political, but 
he views CMU as being a de
politicalized environment.
Ravish Momin, a CMU sopho
more civil engineering student 
and a citizen of Kuwait, spoke 
the skewed picture most Ameri
cans have of life in Kuwait. Ku
wait isnt free. All Bush did was 
to put the monarchy back in 
power, said Momin. Jill Castek,
another speaker and a Pitt se
nior liberal arts student, de
scribed her experience in Iraq 
over the past summer. She told 
how many of the children are 
starving and need proper medi
cine and clean water. I wish I 
did not have to be here, but I 
have a moral responsibility to 
wake up our society, Castek 
said.
At one point, Louis K.: 
Johnston, a CMU alumnus! 
(E,37) and a retired Army Colo
nel, argued with the demonstra
tors. Johnston several times 
called for removal of the demonstrators. I believe, as far as the; 
U.S. government is concerned, 
they could not spend money any

Haiti government overthrown in military coup
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 1, 
(AP)  President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide ent into exile Tuesday after 
the army ousted him and the first demo
cratically elected government in Haitis 
'iiearly two centuries as a nation.
The acting army commander, Brig. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras, announced last 
night that the military had taken con
trol after a day of violence in which at 
Jieast 26 people were killed and 200 
wounded.
The military, which has long domi
nated Haitian politics, accused Aristide 
of interfering in its affairs. Indeed, 
Aristide had retired the armys high 
command and was rumored to be train
ing an elite unit for his protection.
Cedras urged calm and spoke of cre
ating a serene climate favorable to the 
next election.
But many Haitians feared an explo
sion of violence in protest over the 
ousting of Aristide, a tremendously 
popular Roman Catholic priest who had 
championed the cause of the poor 
against dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier 
and a succession of military-dominated 
governments.
Sporadic gunfire rang out early Tues
day in Port-au-Prince, the capital, and 
few ventured outdoors after midnight.
During Aristides nearly eight months 
in office, he forged a good relationship 
with the United States and set about 
improving the lot of the 6 million people 
living in the Western Hemispheres 
poorest country.
The takeover began with mutinies at 
an army base and a police station Sun
day night. Rebel elements fired on 
Aristides private residence at daybreak
and on his entourage as it later headed 
to the National Palace. The soldiers 
later seized the palace, captured 
Aristide and took him to army head
quarters, said his foreign minister, 
Jean-Robert Sabalat.
A prominent Haitian politician, who 
spoke on the condition he not be identi
fied by name, said Prime Minister Rene 
Preval and Information Minister MarieLaurence Jocelyn Lassegue also were 
arrested.
Diplomatic sources said Venezuelan, 
French and U.S. officials negotiated 
with the coup plotters to save the 
presidents life.
U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams ac
companied Aristide to the airport, 
though it was not known what role the 
Bush administration had in securing 
Aristides safe release.
Aristide left for France via Caracas 
at 3:15 am EDT aboard the private 
eight-passenger jet sent byVenezuelan 
President Carlos Andres Perez, an air
port and diplomatic sources said.
Sources said Aristide was accompa
nied by six unidentified members of his 
family and Lt. Pierre Cherubin, the 
Port-au-Prince police chief and sup
porter of the president.
A powerful sector of Haitis 7,000- 
member army has long opposed the 
leftist policies of Aristide, who had sur
vived three previous assassination at
tempts, including one in 1988 by armysupported thugs that killed 12 people 
in his church.
Cedras statement was short on spe
cifics in explaining military grievances. 
But a statement read early yesterday 
by an anonymous soldier on Radio Soleil
said the army was angry that Aristide 
had not approved promotions for nine 
senior officers. Cedras, 42, was one of 
them. He was named interim army 
commander on July 3, replacing Lt. 
Gen. Herard Abraham.
Today, the armed forces find them
selves obligated to assume the heavy 
responsibility to keep the ship of state 
afloat, Cedras said in a statement 
broadcast by Radio France 
Internationale.
After seven months... of democratic 
experience, the country once again finds 
itself a prey to the horrors of uncer
tainty. With all Haitians ... we will 
bring the ship to port.
Aristide has moved since the first day 
of his administration to reform Haitis 
notoriously corrupt army, historically 
an agent of repression.
Scientist: Boeing aware of B-2s flaws
SEATTLE, Oct. 3, (AP)  
Boeing Co. knew more than 
two years ago that the unde
tectable B-2 Stealth bomber 
could be detected with im
pulse radar, claims a scien
tist who was fired by the com
pany.
But a company spokesman 
defended the plane, and said 
its detectability by impulse 
radar hasnt been proved.
Radar specialist Terrence 
Barrett said his superiors at 
Boeing ordered him not to say 
anything about the potential 
problem while Boeing and the 
Air Force lobbied Congress to 
authorize construction of 
more B-2s.
Boeing is a major contrac
tor on the project to build the 
bat-winged bomber, which has 
special coatings to absorb radar 
signals and is shaped to reduce 
reflections of radar back to the 
transmitter.
Barrett said Boeing Aerospace 
officials told him we dont want 
to upset the customer by ex
ploring whether the plane could 
actually be detected.
But Boeing spokesman Tom 
Koehler said the Seattle-based 
company never pressured 
Barrett to withhold information 
about the radar.
His theories on impulse ra
dar are just that  theories, 
Koehler said.
Koehler said he knows of no 
challenge to the B-2s radar in
visibility. Theres been nothing 
found that could beat the B-2.
But last month Air Force Sec
retary Donald Rice announced 
that the B-2 did not meet the 
desired levels of performance, 
after it appeared on radar dur
ing a test flight.
Rice has since argued that the 
bombers radar problems are 
normal and that the now-suc
cessful F-l 17 Stealth fighter had 
much, much worse problems 
during its development.
Impulse radar emits an in
tense, wide-frequency signal. Its 
detection capabilities are classi
fied. The Defense Department, 
however, declined to say what 
type of radar detected the 
bomber.
Radar scientist Terrence 
Barrett said Boeing hired him 
in early 1989, promising to 
support his research and 
eventually making him man
ager for advanced concepts 
in its internal think tank.
But Barrett said Boeing 
didnt provide the promised 
support, attacked his radar 
research and rewrote his ap
plication for Pentagon re
search money.
He was fired in October
1990. Boeing spokesman Tom 
Koehler wouldnt discuss the 
reason for Barretts dis
missal.
Congress has approved 
spending enough for 15 
planes at $865 million a piece.
Congress to enact 
drug test legislation
Cambodia will switch to democracy
BANGKOK, Oct. 3, (AP)  Cambodias ruling Communist Party 
will shift to liberal democracy before the signing this month of an 
agreement to end the countrys 12-year-old civil war, Prime Minis
ter Hun Sen says.
The official Cambodian news agency SPK said the change would 
come at an extraordinary congress of the Kampuchean Peoples 
Revolutionary Party on October 16. The report, first distributed 
Wednesday, reached Bangkok on Thursday.
The SPK report said the pact would be signed October 23 at the 
International Conference on Cambodia in Paris, and free elections 
were envisioned for the end of 1992. The issue of free elections in 
Cambodia have been a major stumbling block to negotiations.
The report quoted Hun Sen as saying the imminent agreement 
allows a change in the partys line toward liberal democracy and 
pluralism.
The party also should clearly confirm its movement toward a 
market economy, he said.
Meanwhile, Hun Sen arrived in New Delhi today on a Ijhree-day 
visit, saying he didnt expect any obstacles toward the imminent 
peace treaty.
Hun Sen said he would like India and the Non Aligned Movement 
to take part in the implementation of the peace settlement that was 
reached in New York last month between his Vietnam-backed 
Phnom Penh government and three guerrilla groups.
The four factions agreed on a procedure for national elections, 
removing the last obstacle to signing the peace treaty.
Hun Sen told reporters at the New Delhi airport that he favored 
early polls, probably in 1992 winter or early 1993.
He said progress toward peace will figure in his talks with Indias 
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao later Thursday.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4, (DJ) 
Congress, under intense pres
sure after the New York subway 
crash this summer, appears on 
the verge of passing legislation 
that would require millions of 
transportation workers to un
dergo testing for alcohol and 
drug use.
House and Senate conferees 
agreed to mandate five types of 
alcohol and drug testing, includ
ing random testing, for trans
portation workers whose jobs 
affect public safety. The legisla
tion had been passed by the Sen
ate a dozen times since 1987, 
but always died in the House in 
the face of union opposition.
But th^ political equation 
changed in the wake of the Aug. 
28 subway wreck, which killed 
five people. Robert Ray, the 
motorman who authorities say 
was drunk at the time of the 
accident, faces murder charges.
Many lawmakers were upset 
when they discovered that mass 
transit workers werent covered 
by federal drug-testing rules 
because of a 1990 court decision. 
Last week, the House approved 
413-5, a nonbinding resolution 
directing the House conferees to 
accept the Senate language on 
alcohol and drug testing.
That provision, authored by 
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D - S.C.) 
and Sen. John Danforth (R -
Mo.), plugs the drug-testing loop
hole for mass-transit workers, 
codifies the drug testing of other 
transportation workers already 
taking place by Transportation 
Department order and, perhaps 
most significantly, mandates 
alcohol testing. Its part of a $31.8 
billion transportation appropria
tions bill for fiscal 1992 that now 
goes to the two chambers for 
final passage.
Chairman John Dingell (D - 
Mich.) of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, who has 
helped kill the HollingsDanforth legislation before, is 
mulling over the situation and 
hasnt decided what course to 
take. But supporters of the test
ing said last weeks lopsided 
House vote will make it hard to 
block the conference version.
Unions assailed the conferees 
action. Earle Putnam, general 
counsel for the Amalgamated 
Transit Union, which won the 
1990 court case blocking federal 
drug testing rules for transit 
workers, called the legislation 
an unnecessary and undesir
able interference with privacy.

F&R gains authority
POLICY, from page 1
governs F&R. The policy states 
that organizations on probation 
must clear all activities with the 
executive committee of Senate. 
The organization will remain on 
probation until lifted by Senate.
The right to override the fiscal 
policy has been reserved so that 
SenatemayawardActivitiesFee
monies to organizations not cov
ered by the Activities Fee policy. 
For example, Senate has allo
cated funds for Mr. Fraternity 
and Greek Sing contests, 
though policy says that the Ac
tivities Fee may not be used for 
events which donate their pro
ceeds to charity. It now takes a 
two-thirds vote of the Senate,
not just F&R, to override fiscal 
policy.
Senate chair, Chris Neighbor, 
fifth year architect, said, Clubs 
and organizations will now have 
to take F&R seriously. Senate 
now has more power in that it 
can override the fiscal policy and 
have defined probation for the 
next time we need it.

Corrections...
The calendar in last weeks exam schedule ad should have shown that Monday, December 9 
will be an exam day.
In the September 30 sports shorts, the summary of the CMU Rugby Clubs scoring was - 
incorrectly reported. Neil Talsamia scored twice for CMU; Bill Lucier scored three times.
In the caption for last weeks Fifth Year Scholar photo, the following names were misspelled: 
Russell Lehrer, Nicole Brockmann, Jennifer Bourque, and Jacqueliyn Cuccano.
Last weeks Scotch N Soda preview should have said that it is Dietz and Raibon who look on ! 
as Humer flexes his muscles, and the line quoted from Master of Disaster should have been 
attributed to Vaughan.
In last weeks Kamege, in the listing of all student organizations, WRCT was misspelled.
Clarification...
In last weeks Kamege in the story about the Carnegie Tech Radio Club, their activity was 
wrongly named. They do not broadcast, they transmit.
The Tartan corrects all errors of fact. If you know of an error, please contact Beth Moses atx2111, ' 
or write her care of The Tartan.

Both sides of the issue...
Approximately 8,000 people participated in the Life Chain, along Forbes and Fifth Avenues 
on Sunday afternoon. The demonstration was organized by churches in Allegheny County to 
protest abortion. Participants included people from Pittsburgh, Tarentum, and surrounding 
areas. The protestors carried signs reading Abortion Kills Children and Jesus Forgives 
and Saves with songs and prayers printed on the back. Jo Deasy, a local participant, said, 
[It is] a prayerful, peaceful demonstration to show we're In support of the unborn.
A few of the fraternities took this opportunity to express their political views. Delta Upsilon 
painted signs and propped them against its porch. Phi Kappa Theta flew an American flag 
next to a banner reading Choice and played the Star Spangled Banner repeatedly.

Mehrabian speaks on undergrad education
Mehrabian, from page 1
them in the classroom and out of 
the classroom. Mehrabian ex
pressed interest in an evalua
tion and resurrection of the Car
negie Plan started in the late 
1930s, an innovative approach 
to interdisciplinary education 
with emphasis on problem solv
ing and the learning process. 
Carnegie Tech, he said, was once 
a pioneer in education, and it is 
now time for Carnegie Mellon to 
continue in this tradition. 
Steinberg outlined a more for
malized plan for action after 
Mehrabians address.
Mehrabian next recognized 
the increasingly global nature 
of the economy. Graduates are
in competition not only with 
people from the U.S. but with 
people across the world. The 
world has changed dramatically, 
unpredictably overnight, he 
said, and that only through the 
exchange of ideas, culture, and 
knowledge are we able adjust to 
the global community. Students 
need to know things beyond eco
nomics.
Mehrabian noted the Uni
versitys initiatives in helping 
students prepare for this mar
ketplace. He cited the Centre de 
Tours in France, as well as other 
exchange programs that allow 
students to live with different 
languages and cultures. Addi
tionally, he recognized the open
ing of the Office for Interna
tional Studies in Japan as a co
operative effort between coun
tries to provide students with 
educational opportunities and 
access to cutting-edge technolo
gies. Mehrabian stressed the 
continued commitment to the 
growth and strengthening of the 
Modem Languages Department 
and the creation of the Interna
tional Festival as building strong 
ties to other cultures and lan
guages.
Mehrabian also announced the 
formation of an advisory board 
for each department in the Uni
versity. The boards are headed 
by a member of the Board of 
Trustees and includes approxi
Commission plans changes
COMMISSION, from page 1
undergraduates, as well as 
assess and improve the cur
rent curriculum, department 
retention rates, and the cam
pus community as a whole.
Mehrabian and Steinberg 
are interested in reevaluating 
the use of problem-solving 
skills and interdisciplinary 
studies in a campus-wide cur
riculum, implemented through 
the innovative Carnegie Plan 
of the 1930s and 40s. One of 
the commissions hopes is to 
create as large a set of com
mon courses among the col
leges as possible to promote 
interaction and inter-education among students.
Commission members were 
chosen to represent the Uni
versity community broadly, 
paying careful attention to 
what Steinberg calls the poli
tics of the process. I mean 
politics in the best sense of the 
word, he says. People have to 
feel they are represented and 
representative of where they 
come from.
Faculty were chosen through 
conferences among Steinberg 
and the deans of each college. 
The deans and assistant deans 
of the colleges are also mem
bers of the commission. Ad
ministration and staff were 
chosen because of their par
ticular interest or expertise in 
a certain area.
Students, however, had a dif
ferent selection process. A list 
of students was generated by 
Student Body President Hyun 
Shin, Student Senate Chair 
Chris Neighbor, and Dean of
Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy. The Senate Execu
tive Committee then voted to 
approve the nominees. We 
wanted students with high 
visibility within their col
leges, says Shin, so that 
they would be able to encour
age others to participate. 
The student representatives 
are Nicole Brockman, CFA; 
Julie Liu, IM; Patrick Ohlin, 
H&SS; Rajesh Putcha, CIT; 
and Kelly Satterwhite, MCS. 
Shin and the Chair of Senate 
Academic Affairs Committee 
Michael Tomblyn also have 
seats on the commission.
The commission is ready to 
begin to address problems in 
undergraduate education im
mediately. There will not be 
an exploration committee to 
evaluate the undergraduate 
program and produce a re
port. This is not a mission 
committee. We already know 
where the problems are, 
Steinberg stated in Mondays 
meeting. They will break into 
smaller task forces to address 
one often immediate areas of 
concern chosen by the com
mission, ranging from advis
ing and research opportuni
ties, to the intent and impact 
of a Carnegie Mellon educa
tion.
Members of individual task 
forces were decided at the 
initial meeting of the com
mission last Monday. Each 
task force will draft a steer
ing charge in cooperation 
with Steinberg. Each task 
force is also responsible for 
submitting frequent progress
reports. When Steinberg feels 
that enough task forces have 
something to share with the 
rest of the commission, they 
will meet again. Steinberg an
ticipates that the next full meet
ing of the commission will be in 
January.
There are not enough mem
bers on the commission to ad
equately fill each task force. 
Therefore, Steinberg and the 
commission will be looking to 
flesh out the committees with 
more students and faculty ac
cording to expertise and inter
est. All students interested in 
participating are encouraged 
to contact Steinberg or Shin for 
more information.
The commissions work will 
be an ongoing process. As task 
forces complete their studies 
and submit recommendations, 
new ones will be formed. The 
task forces will try to address 
all areas of concern that ap
pear to be of interest to the 
campus community. In any i 
event, both Mehrabian and 
Steinberg are committed to 
implementing as many recom
mendations as possible to im
prove the undergraduate envi
ronment.
I could retire right now, 
says Steinberg. Ive got a reputation as a good teacher, 
scholar, and communicator. I 
didnt take this position to dis
sipate that reputation.... I 
would not have taken this posi
tion unless I was persuaded 
that we are in fact going to do a 
good job.... How far we are to 
go, that well have to wait and

mately 15 experts in the field, 
independent from the Univer
sity. The boards are to meet with 
faculty and students, to review 
the departments curricula, and 
to critique the departments com
petitiveness, usefulness, and 
. vitality. We need to know what 
our weaknesses are, he said, to 
know what we need to improve 
or change.
Mehrabian cited a specific ex
ample of the advisory boards at 
work. A comprehensive review 
of the Design Department was 
completed last spring that found 
the current computer facilities 
for design severely lacking. Over 
the summer, the Reese cluster 
was completely overhauled and
converted to a state-of-the-art 
facility.
The advisory boards have an 
additional benefit, because they 
link each trustee intimately with 
one particular educational as
pect of the University. As a re
sult, the Board of Trustees as a 
whole is complete in their un
derstanding of Carnegie Mellon, 
and is therefore better able to 
address needs and concerns of 
the campus.
Mehrabian acknowledged 
Carnegie Mellons continued 
underrepresentation of minori
ties in the student body. As a 
result, the University is reevalu
ating its level of commitment to 
CMAP, and making appropri
ate changes. The program now 
has a larger budget than ever, 
and participants in CMAP are 
being asked how to improve it 
and to recruit and retain more 
minorities. One suggestion is a 
recruitment video, which is be
ing planned and produced in 
cooperation with CMAP stu
dents.
Mehrabian ended by briefly 
recognizing the fruition of the 
Fifth Year Scholar Program and 
the student effort that made itn 
happen. He urged all students., 
to participate as fully as they,, 
can in the upcoming Interna
tional Festival, and that they.; 
continue to take an active part 
in the campus community.

search, said Johnston. Eirene 
responded by saying, I love

The Pittsburgh Students for 
Peace is a coalition of local col
lege and high school students 
opposed to the U.S. action in the 
Middle East and has been in 
several demonstrations. The 
Pittsburgh Students for Peace 
are now concerned with lifting 
the U.S. sanctions against Iraq 
and educating the CMU and 
Pittsburgh communities about 
CMU and the University of Pitts
burghs involvements with the 
Defense Department.
According to Erin Bush, CMU 
receives 37 percent of its fund
ing from the Defense Depart
ment, while the Computer Sci

said Bush, CMU freshmen are 
learning computer languages 
which are used for programming 
weapon systems, most notably 
the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
These figures, according to 
Eirene, were given by former 
Provost Angel Jordan.
Erin Bush said, There is no 
academic freedom at Pitt and
CMU because so much funding 
comes from outside sources. Mili
tary action in Iraq would not 
have been carried out without 
the weapons systems developed 
at CMU.
It took my generation 16 years, 
to forget about Vietnam, and the 
sanctions are still in place, said 
Eirene in closing. Its taken the 
present generation only seven 
months to forget about Iraq.

FORUM
Policy signals progress
Student Senate has made some 
changes in its fiscal policy which 
will have a positive impact on 
all students, but Senates use of 
its ability to override the policy 
remains a problem.
The first of the important 
changes is that the fiscal policy 
now mandates that after all of 
the preliminary budget hear
ings, the subsidies approved by 
the Funding and Recognition 
Committee (F&R) must be pub
lished in The Tartan and in the 
Student Union. This is a posi
tive move on Senates part be
cause it will give all students 
access to the preliminary bud
get so they can attend the final 
budget approval meeting and 
exercise their right to have a say 
about the allocation of their Ac
tivities Fee.
Another important change is 
that Senate has defined a pro
bation measure and dictated the 
conditions for imposing it. Pro
bation is to be imposed if an 
organization violates any one of 
a number of the fiscal policies or 
procedures. All activities of the 
organization during the proba
tionary period must be cleared 
with the executive committee of 
Student Senate. We would like 
to see Senate enforce this policy 
when necessary to insure that 
the students Activities Fee is 
not being misused.
Senate has also changed its 
rule about overriding the fiscal 
policy. It now requires a twothirds vote of the entire Senate 
to override the fiscal policy, in
stead of two-thirds of F&R -- 
which could be as few as four of
six people. This is very impor
tant because the power to over
ride the stated policy of Senate 
should not be left in the hands of 
a minority of the full Senate.
One of the items that Senate 
did not change is the rule stat
ing, events which donate their 
proceeds to charity will not be 
funded by the Activities Fee. 
We think this is an excellent 
policy. The Activities Fee is paid 
by students and is intended to 
be used for the benefit of stu
dents, not charity. Senate seems 
to agree in principle because this 
was not cut in the fiscal policy 
revision. In fact, however, it has 
repeatedly overridden this policy 
and funded such charity events 
such as Mr. Fraternity 1991, 
Greek Sing 1991, and Mr. Fra
ternity 1990.
While these events can be a lot 
of fun for a lot of people, the 
ultimate beneficiaries are chari
ties, not students. It is accept
able for Senate to front money 
for these events, but that money 
should be repaid from the pro
ceeds.
We like the changes in the 
newest revision of the fiscal 
policy. Unfortunately, Senate 
doesnt have much of a history of 
sticking to everything in the 
policy. There is a reason for the 
dictates of the policy, which is to 
provide for the allocation of the 
Activities Fee in the way that 
will best benefit the most stu
dents. Senate should pay close 
attention to the changes it has 
made, and follow the stated 
policy on all but the rarest occa
sions.
Initatives require input
Last Wednesday in the Ball
room, CMU President Robert 
Mehrabian and Vice-Provost for 
Undergraduate Education 
Erwin Steinberg spoke about 
several different initiatives, in
cluding their goals for the im
provement of undergraduate 
education. Both Mehrabian and 
Steinberg were concerned about 
what students had to say, but by 
the low turnout at the event, it 
seems that students were not 
interested in saying anything. 
This lack of interest is unac
ceptable and appalling.
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
seem to be more willing to com
plain about the University than 
to get involved and help make 
changes. We have a president 
and a vice-provost who are both 
concerned about helping under
graduates receive the best edu
cation possible at CMU. It is 
now the students turn to make 
some effort.
Steinberg has set up several 
task forces to look in depth at 
undergraduate education, rang
ing from developing learning 
opportunities outside the class
room to establishing an honor 
code. These are opportunities 
for students to get involved in 
making changes at CMU that 
will affect not only their aca
demic experience but the expe
riences of future classes.
Although it may be cathartic 
to complain to your roommate 
and friends about what you dont 
like about Carnegie Mellon and 
what you would change if you

If you dont get involved  
whether by becoming part of one 
of the task-forces or by just show
ing up for lectures like last 
Wednesdays with two or three 
friends in tow  then your com
plaints are just empty words. 
The old adage if you want some
thing done right you have to do 
it yourself seems to apply here. 
If you want to see what you 
consider to be positive action, 
then you must play an active 
role in its implementation.
The levels of participation can 
range from being involved in 
the creation and development of 
new ideas and programs to 
checking out the programs once 
they are in place and providing 
feedback so that the improve
ments might continue.
Mehrabian and Steinberg have 
the power and the money to 
make these changes happen. But 
the one necessary ingredient is 
something that they cannot con
trol: student participation. In
volvement is vital to making pro
grams successful.
Changes in undergraduate 
education are on the horizon. If 
students see a real need for 
change  and judging by all the 
complaints about CMU, they do
 then they must speak up. 
Otherwise, they have no right to 
continue complaining. We en
courage students to become in
volved and help these very am
bitious initiatives succeed. Its a 
matter of put up or shut up.

gripes in The Tartan 
about resources de
voted to teaching ver
sus research [Schools 
cheat students through research, 9/23] 
most probably have some justification 
although arguments to the contrary do 
exist. I sympathize with his predicament 
 it seems that in his years here he has 
not had an opportunity to get an educa
tion which will stand in good stead in the 
increasingly globalized world economy. 
In particular, I note that he has not had 
exposure to world cultures and lan
guages.
If he had, he would have known that 
the word Hindu refers to the folio wers of 
a great religion and not a language as 
implicit in his use of Hindu or Chineselaced English. It is indeed true that 
Hindi is an Indian language and its 
possible that some of his teachers have 
Hindi -laced English. On the other hand, 
not every Indian speaks Hindi nor, I 
would suggest, all Chinese have the same 
accent.
CMU has, I think, a responsibility to 
ensure that the likes of Robinson get to 
learn a little bit more about the world 
around them. If Robinson wants to ac
quire a greater degree of awareness on 
this score than A1 Bundy, may I suggest 
that he spend some time at the upcoming 
Fall Festival events and learn a little bit
about Asia? Maybe then hell thank Presi
dent Mehrabian for having enriched his 
mind just a little bit. Otherwise, good 
luck with the shoe sales.

CMU must enforce 
state code on alcohol
yoLetter to the Editor
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
In last weeks issue 
of The Tartan, Adam 
Gross attacked po
tential policies I pro
posed [CMU must 
take strong stance on alcohol policy, 9/ 
23] to effectively address the perplex
ing problem of underage drinking on 
the CMU campus [ Suggested alcohol 
policy threatens rights, 9/30]. I would 
like to restate that the main point of my 
original letter was that existing poli
cies do not satisfactorily control the 
problem of underage drinking.
The two potential solutions to this 
problem that I proposed were merely 
sub-points of my main argument pro
vided for example purposes only and 
they should be read as such. My policy 
proposals are just that  suggestions 
of possible paths of action to achieve 
the desired goal. I maintain that cur
rent policies require re-evaluation, and 
that new policies should be considered 
to combat the embarrassing problem of 
underage drinking.
Gross states in his response that 
CMU police are not officers of the law, 
but officers of CMU policy.... I would 
like to remind him that in the CMU 
Student Handbook on pages 38-39, the 
Universitys policies against underage 
drinking are clearly established. Cer
tain sections from the legal code of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are 
specifically cited as elements of the 
Universitys policy (Sections 6308(a), 
6309(a), 6310.1(a), and 6310.6).
Since CMU police are officers of CMU 
policy, this means they should enforce 
the Universitys policies, which in this 
case clearly include state regulations 
that pertain to underage drinking. 
Therefore my original statement with
stands Grosss misdirected attack.
I am deeply concerned about this is
sue because the CMU students of today 
will become the prominent members of 
society tomorrow. Alcohol is a drug, and 
you can get addicted to it. This addic
tion can ruin everything youve worked 
for. I dont want to see the future lead
ers of our society become dependent 
upon this drug. Ask yourself  is it 
worth the risk?
The fact remains that underage drink
ing is illegal. And it hurts the health of 
our student community here at Carn
egie Mellon. Many people laugh about 
underage drinking until it becomes a 
dangerous problem, and only then is it 
taken seriously. Why let it go that far?

Cleanup impresses no one
Every year, a week before Homecoming, the 
campus explodes into activity... the admin
istration rushing to clean up the school. 
Why? To try and impress the alumni....
Rich Robinson
Homecoming weekend is filled with 
excitement and activities, celebrating 
the return of the alumni visiting their 
alma mater. Sounds and smells fill the 
air, from dances, speeches, food cook
ing on the Cut, the roar of the crowd at 
the football game, the smell of manure 
baking in the sun, the roar of lawn 
mowers, and the usual sounds of the 
campus trying to fix itself up.
It never fails. Every year, a week 
before Homecoming, the campus ex
plodes into activitynot students get
ting ready for the weekend activities 
but the administration rushing to clean 
up the school. Why? To try and impress 
the alumni with the great condition of 
the campus and, therefore, get bigger 
donations.
Also, we cannot forget that a large 
number of parents come up to see their 
children. The administration wants to 
make sure that the parents think that 
the $21,750 is actually going some
where other than Warner Halls pri
vate bank book.
This is my fourth Homecoming, and I 
cant help but laugh. Its amazing how 
much work the University will put into 
fixing up the campus just for the alumni. 
For example, the area outside UCC thats 
been blockaded since the beginning of 
the semester is now fixed. The portions 
of the walkway that arent fixed have
perfectly fitting planks in place.
The grass, where it does grow, used 
to be two inches high. Now it has a buzz 
cut most ROTC members would find 
short. The cracks in the sidewalk have 
been filled so the alumni wont trip and 
hurt themselves and even the food in 
Highlander looks more appetizing.
But why does the administration fix 
up the campus now and let it go to hell 
the rest of the year? You see, the alumni 
are not definitely going to give donations 
to the school. We, the students, are al
ready here, paid in full. It becomes rather 
apparent where priorities lay when the 
situation is presented like that.
What this schools administration fails 
to realize is that these alumni were 
undergraduates at one time. They know 
what the school is like, and therefore, 
are probably not fooled by these quickfix tactics. The University must begin to 
realize that the current undergraduates 
are the future alumni. For most schools, 
alumni donations account for a substan
tial part of the budget. I wonder if this is 
true at Carnegie Mellon  I hear that 
the University part was dropped to 
appear more corporate-like for business 
correspondence. When a school has a 
ranking of 47 in student satisfaction 
according to U.S. News and World 
Reports University Report, it can prob
ably forget about getting many dona
tions.
So, what is the point of all these 
superficial beautification activities? On 
Monday, the yellow tape around UCC 
will be back, the cracks in the sidewalk 
will get bigger as the rain washes out, 
the temporary filler, and the food in 
Highlander will be as bad as it was two 
weeks ago. Who is being fooled?
The administration has to wake up, 
and sometime soon. Homecoming just 
illustrates this more. Yes, research has 
made a name for Carnegie Mellon, but 
so have its students: actors like Ted 
Danson and the casts of L.A. Law and 
Hill Street Blues, astronauts like Edgar 
D. Mitchell, who walked on the moon, 
and leaders in the business and politi
cal world. The list is endless. But do any 
of these alumni come back to visit? I 
havent seen them. Maybe its because 
while they were here, the university 
treated them in much the same way it 
treats the current undergraduates  
money in the bank, and cattle to get out 
to pasture. Isnt it time that changed?

Envelope reveals parking secrets
Jason McDonald
While walking through the Skibo Park
ing Garage over the weekend, I found a 
plain brown envelope which someone 
had apparently dropped. Upon examin
ing the contents, I realized that I had 
stumbled upon one of the greatest se
crets of Carnegie Mellon University. In 
short, I discovered the secret of why 
parking at this university costs so damn 
much.
It starts with those little orange tags 
that you have to put on the rearview 
mirror. They look pretty innocent, right? 
According to the memos in the envelope, 
those; little tags take up almost $150 of 
your average $350 parking permit. First 
of all, the tag is not actually plastic; 
instead, its made of a mineral which 
looks and feels remarkably like plastic. 
After being imported from Africa, the 
mineral is crushed, dyed, pressed, and 
rolled into sheets. The sheets are then 
cut iiito the tags, and are hand-painted 
atthesame place that makes commemo
rative Elvis plates and the pieces for 
Civil War chess sets. Yeah, its expen
sive, but a world-class university de
mands world-class mirror tags.
The gate keycards are another big ex
penditure. My friend Steve had to pay 
$10 to get his gate card replaced  the 
same card that costs $2 at the beginning 
of the semester  and then couldnt get 
his money refunded when he found the 
original card. To add insult to injury, 
Parking took his original card back! I 
thought this was very silly until I read 
the gate card procedure memo from the 
envelope.
Basically, the Parking Office has an 
elite task force that runs around muggingpeople and taking their credit cards. 
The task force then takes the credit 
cards and flattens them out, paints them, 
and gives them to space owners. The 
reason different cards open different 
gates is that MAC does one part of the 
campus, Visa handles another, et cetera.
So when Steve had to get a new card, 
Parking had to special-order mug some
one, as opposed to stockpiling over the 
summer  a real pain in the neck for 
them. Besides, the muggers make stan
dard work-study rates whether the cards 
get used or not.
Why did they take the original back? 
Well, you know how you sometimes find 
a card you thought you lost...? Basically, 
giving back a few cards a year cuts down 
on the potential legal liability if someone 
ever finds out.
The parking spaces themselves also 
cost a pretty pennyroughly $70 of the 
average parking permit.
The asphalt is apparently fully in
My friend Steve had to pay $10 to get his gate 
card replaced  the same card that costs $2 
at the beginning of the semester  and then 
couldnt get his money refunded when he 
found the original card.
suredif the asphalt ever sublimates to 
the gaseous state, the University is to
tally covered. You can never tell when 
that sort of thing might happen, you 
know. The yellow lines look pretty simple, 
but not so. All the parking lots were 
originally painted yellow, and then the 
rest of the surface was painted black 
again.
Parking also needs a large fund to 
maintain the flotilla of vehicles used to 
block off access to various lots by parking 
completely or partially in front of the 
entrances. Apparently they even own a 
school bus that they use for this purpose 
(in addition to the usual armored cars 
and unmarked vehicles).
Parking also has a special staff that 
gets drunk every weekend and goes out 
specifically to break the gates. Remem
ber that the Parking people are just like 
the rest of ustheir greatest hope in life 
is to get in the Crime and Incident report, 
and this is how they go about it.
Finally, theres the cross-over deal with 
the Pittsburgh police. Those muggers
that provide the gate card stock? During 
the day, they help the Pittsburgh police by 
running around watching the city parking 
meters, yet theyre still billed on the CMU 
payroll. When someone doesnt have any 
change, they go alert the meter maidif 
youre discreet, you can see them lurking 
in the bushes. When a meter jams, they 
bring out the tool box and fix it, or they 
take time off working meters. They also 
move cars around so that there are as 
many partial parking spaces as possible. I 
have a suspicion that they sneak into my 
house and change all my quarters into 
dimes and nickles so they can nail me 
later.
Well, that explains the mystery of park
ing. Next week, Ill see if I can hang 
around Warner Hall and find any enve
lopes containing the secret of the $15,000 
tuition.

Judge Thomas on qualifications, not image
Chris Restifo
For ihose of you who keep up on world 
events there is no doubt that your atten
tion has been focused on the tensions in 
Iraq, foe fighting in Croatia, the problems 
in Soiith Africa and the Soviet Union, and 
the difficulties developing with the Middle 
East peace process. However, I think its 
time chat we turn our attention, at least 
brief]/, towards an important event here 
atholne.The apparent lack of concern about 
this event shown by both the American 
people and the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee frightens me. Clarence Thomas is on 
his \jay to the Supreme Court, and no one 
seenls to really care.
Tlje Senate Judiciary Committee voted 
to confirm Thomas. Usually, if a 
candidate for the position of Supreme 
Court justice is voted down in the commitee, there is very little chance for 
rmation. Some of you may say, Well, 
ote was tied; so Thomas confirmahimself out of almost certain destitu
tion, went on to Yale, became an excel
lent lawyer, achieved the position of fed
eral appeals judge, and became head of 
the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC). Politically, it was 
a clever move. How could the Demo
crats, the NAACP, and other liberal 
groups oppose such a nomination and 
not appear hypocritical? It seems to me 
that they could have done a better job by
completely useless. Although natural law 
can be utilized to show abortion as being 
wrong, the idea of privacy afforded by 
Roe vs. Wade can come from the same 
idea. On all these issues, Thomas art
fully danced around the Senators. He 
had plenty of coaching. Bush was ready, 
and the Judiciary Committee had no 
chance of Borking Clarence Thomas.
What if the committee had looked at 
Thomas record? Well, if they drilled him
move. When Thomas himself was a judge, 
he failed to make mention of the fact that 
he had close ties to John Danforth. You 
might think that was no big deal except 
that Danforths family owned a large part 
of Ralston-Purina; Thomas threw out a 
lawsuit against this company. Thomas is 
damn lucky that this didnt blossom into a 
major issue or the vote would not have 
been 7-7.
If Thomas record doesnt scare you,-his
Thomas is the only Supreme Court nominee who hasn't received the 
American Bar Association's rating of well qualified. Part of the 
organization's hesitation is based on the fact that Thomas does not 
have any real experience in being a constitution lawyer or a judge.
coni 
the
tion isnt definite. I wish that was true. 
Evefi before the vote was passed, both 
supjorters and opponents voiced the 
opiiion that Thomas approval by the 
coirmittee was a given. Thats a shame, 
for i shows not only that politicians care 
onlj about politics on the high court, but 
also that they dont know how to pick a 
capible nominee.
We all know that Thomas was picked 
by President Bush because he is a black 
conservative who exemplified the rags 
tp r|ches tale. Here is a man who, with 
the help of his Catholic education, pulled
concentrating not on Thomas politics or 
beliefs but on his actual qualifications.
Thomas is the only Supreme Court 
nominee who hasnt received the Ameri
can Bar Associations rating of well 
qualified.Part of the organizations hesi
tation is based on the fact that Thomas 
does not have any real experience in 
being a constitution lawyer or a judge. 
Hes only been a judge for a little over a 
year and a half. When Senator Patrick 
Leahy asked Thomas to name what he 
thought were some very important cases 
that have come before the Supreme 
Court, Thomas named only two cases, 
one of which was Roe vs. Wade.
Instead of concerning themselves with 
his actual record, the Senators played 
right into Bushs ploy. They tried to nail 
Thomas down on such vague subjects as 
abortion, privacy, and the infamous con
cept of natural law. This point was
about it, they would have easily shown 
him to be a very shaky character. Of 
course, the conservative Senators would 
still have voted for him, but at least his 
image wouldnt have the gloss and shine 
conservatives want. After all, here is a 
man destined to replace Thurgood 
Marshall, a man whose main experience 
has been in tax law, energy, and. the 
environment. Here is a man who, as 
head of the EEOC, let thousands of cases 
go unprosecuted. Here is a man who at 
first opposed the use of racial quotas for 
hiring practices, and months later sup
ported the concept.
Thomas actions also reveal a man who 
may not be the type youd like to have 
sitting on the bench. He transferred the 
chief of the San Francisco branch of the 
EEOC after that man made some re
marks about the lack of approval for 
lawsuits. A federal judge prevented that
lack of record should. Hes written only 20 
opinions as a federal appeals judge, and of 
those 20, none dealt with the Constitution 
or related topics. Compound this piece of 
information with his seeming inability to 
name more than two important Supreme 
Court decisions, and youll see he is not 
qualified for this position.
The frightening thing is that Thomas 
just might be confirmed. Politics often has 
little regard for competency. No one in his 
or her right mind can support this nomina
tion. The man has no solid background, 
professionals dont think of him as quali
fied, and his record at the EEOC is less 
than admirable. One would hope that the 
Bush Administration and the Senate could 
come up with someone worthy to replace 
the great mind of Thurgood Marshall.

Subliminal ideas 
infiltrate CMU
ijvJcl'k Ckcw-j
Franklin Chang
Well my friends, I fear that I 
am the harbinger of bad news. It 
seems that the administration 
of Carnegie Mellon has been 
using subliminal messages to 
control the student body. It has 
placed a large network of sub
liminal messages all over cam
pus to keep the students from 
becoming outraged at anything, 
and thereby avoid bad press. I 
am not sure whether these mes
sages have infiltrated The Tar
tan, but it is likely. (Not, we love 
you. ) Dont try to find these mes
sages, as they are invisible to 
the naked eye.
Subliminal messages are mes
sages that use speed and other 
methods to avoidbeingrecognized
by the conscious mind while the 
messages imprint themselves on 
the subconscious mind. For in
stance, one frame of a film was 
replaced by a frame that said eat 
popcorn. When the film was 
shown, movie goers reported see
ing nothing unusual  and yet 
the popcorn stand made some
thing like fifty percent more sales 
than usual. The power of sublimi
nal messages is obvious. (Sure, 
there is a computer for every stu
dent, we just didnt say one for 
each all the time.)
My discovery of this frighten
ing and outrageous administra
tive transgression arose acciden
tally. At a showing of The Grifters 
there were transitions between 
parts of the movie, and I was 
surprised to see during one of 
these transitions the words Tar
tan food good. Later, I noticed 
the message Dick loves his meal

trol its children. ( Whenyougrow 
uD you too can come and work at 
CMU.)
j also found that the adminis
tration is using subliminal mes
sages not only to promote specific 
goals, but also to confiise stu
dents. (Your mother loves you.) 
For instance, I keep having these 
dreams where Im naked on a 
Tibetan peak with sixty nymphs 
and the only way we can keep 
warm is by having long and ardu
ous s.... Wait, maybe thats just 
me. None the less, they are using 
subliminal messages to confuse 
and thereby passify students. For 
instance, I arrived at the High
lander Cafe three seconds before 
closing. I was let in and payed for 
my dinner. But by the time I got 
through the serving line, both 
had closed. The food was still 
there, but the worker wouldnt 
serve it to me. I looked in the soup 
dish and it was empty. I tried to 
get something to drink but every
thing was already disconnected
and/or empty. So I went to the 
salad bar, which was already be
ing eaten by the workers who 
were dismantling it. Even tired, 
hungry, and irritated, I did noth
ing. You might say it was my 
laziness, but after hearing the 
hard evidence provided today, you 
must also come to the conclusion 
that I have been made subliminally impotent. (.Nymphs like 
white elephants.)
I encourage you to raise your 
awareness to the passivity around 
you. Nothing is safe or sacred. 
Big Brother wants you to accept 
everything the University throws 
at you. Dont be a victim.

Tartans roll past Adrian, 20-12
PASS
by Jason McDonald
By ROBERT FLATT
Special to The Tartan
No, it isnt a new wash pow
der; no, it isnt a new special 
offer from Dining Service; no, it 
isnt yet another ceding Russian 
republic ... tchoukball is a new 
sport that will be demonstrated 
today in Thistle Hall from 4- 
5:30 pm. Everybody is welcome 
to come along and join in the 
game; if enough interest is 
shown, practices or matches will 
then be held on a weekly basis.
The history of tchoukball
Tchoukball was invented by a 
Swiss doctor named Hermann 
Brandt. He was convinced of the 
educational importance of 
sporting activities, but was 
nevertheless concerned about 
the frequently resultinginjuries 
his profession led him to see. 
After studying sports for many 
years, he came up with a new 
team game named tchoukball.
The rules of tchoukball are 
arranged in such a way as to 
offer intense games without any 
conflict between members of
|i Ice hockey 
(tragically) 
comes of age
[ Hockey season is here again.
 Normally this fact would make 
He very happy, especially 
since the Penguins finally 
walked away with the Stanley 
Cup last season. Unfortulately, I find myself filled with 
Iread because hockey has 
inally become a Sport. 
ri No, not a sport. A Sport. A 
big-money, expansionist, bandwagoning, players-against^wners Sport.
i And it looked like hockey 
vould hold on for so long. It 
ifras supposed to remain a nice 
ittle regional game that only1
3 criminally insane loved 
cause it was too violent, 
lfortunately, the secret is 
w out, and all the dark 
ces of the sporting world 
ve descended on hockey.
First of all theres the new 
eed of hockey fan: slimy 
tie yuppies who go to games 
be trendy, with no sense of 
e history behind the team 
eyve loved for years. It 
ally pissed me off that, after 
I ray years of loyalty to the 
nguins, I sat at home 
iring the Cup drive while 
ople who couldnt tell you 
iff Paiements jersey number 
t alone who Paiement was) 
t in box seats at the Arena. 
Pop quiz: Who were the 
her two Pittsburgh firstund picks the year the Pens 
j got Mario Lemieux? Id tell you 
1 the answer, but that question 
is currently my way of weed
ing out pretenders. Its a 
Rirtual lock that none of the 
yuppie slime knows the other 
=' two names.
9 Expansionism is another 
; telltale sign of hockeys transi; tion to a Sport. Its not a bad 
; sign  personally, Id like to 
||see hockey span the continent 
!  but its a signal of the fact 
i that somebodys out to cash in 
: on the games newfound 
; ^popularity. You dont hear 
| many calls for expansion in 
Arena football.
|Also, the money stories, 
^usually the forte of baseball,
are starting to creep into the 
media. Eric Lindros, Quebecs 
number one draft pick, refuses 
to play for the Nordiques, and 
wants a trade to a contender. 
Closer to home, when Pens 
winger Kevin Stevens signed a 
contract offer from the Boston 
Bruins, he threatened legal 
action if the Pens signed him 
and traded him, rather than 
lose him to free agency or eat 
his contract.
As an aside, I hope no one 
signs Lindros; hes a megalomaniacal little punk who 
obviously would think himself 
too important to function well 
as part of a team. Stevens is 
one of my favorite Penguins, 
but hes got a lot of nerve 
acting so insulted when hes 
going to make around a 
million a year no matter where 
he ends up.
There are a lot of other signs 
' big names gravitating 
toward major media markets, 
increased coverage in Sports 
Illustrated, high-profile team 
owners, that damn Gary 
Glitter tune. One can only 
hope we dont start seeing 
George Steinbrenner lurking 
around the Civic Arena club 
; i boxes.
. Tartan Sports Editor Jason 
\ McDonald is a senior IM 
i major.
Tchoukball promotes cooperation over competition
opposing teams. Inl970, Brandt 
presented his work to the Inter
national Federation of Physical 
Education, which awarded him 
the Thulin Prize, as the winner 
of the First International Liter
ary Concourse on the Theory of 
Physical Education.
Playing with people of differ
ent skills, ages, and gender is 
normal in tchoukball. The abil
ity to adapt ones game to the 
other players capabilities re
quires increasing ones own 
skills. This means that an ad
vanced player and a beginner 
can play together, learning from 
each other. A ground for posi
tive educational interaction is 
therefore created. In order to 
preserve this spirit, all players 
commit themselves to respect
ing the charter of tchoukball, 
which describes, with amazing 
accuracy, the ethics of sports.
How the game is played
There are two teams of nine 
(or seven) players, on a 20x40 
meter (15x20 meter) playing 
field. At each end, there is a

Bulldogs big 
plays fall short
By NATALIE M. GESMOND
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor 
& JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Bulldogs bark was worse 
than their bite.
Facing a ferocious defense, a 
poised rookie quarterback, and 
speedy receivers and running 
backs, the Adrian College Bull
dogs suffered their first defeat 
of the season Saturday, 20-12, 
at the hands of the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans.
The Bulldogs boasted a de
fense that had not been scored 
upon in three games this sea
son, and one of the premier rush
ers in Division III. They ranked 
third in the nation in scoring 
defense, giving up an average of 
only 3.3 points per game, and 
were 19th in total defense, al
lowing only 210 yards per game.
But the Tartarisweretheones 
who put the bite on, scoring a 
pair of touchdowns and adding 
two field goals in the second half. 
It was a big plus for us [to score 
against them], said senior half
back Drew Pizzurro. I think it 
kind of demoralized them a little 
bit.
Dianne Keen/Tartan Photographer 
Freshman quarterback Chris Dee, making his first collegiate start, led the Tartans to a 20-12 
Homecoming win over Adrian College.
We dominated the line, and 
that made the game, said jun
ior offensive guard Rich Wilson.
The defense, meanwhile, in
tercepted four RyanHoltz passes 
and put the clamps on Bulldogs 
franchise fullback Robert 
Thompson.
Thompson, last weeks Michi
gan Intercollegiate Athletic As
sociation player of the week, had 
rushedfor 100-plus yards in each 
of Adrians three games this sea
son. Prior to Saturday, he had 
accounted for 63 percent of the 
Bulldogs rushing offense, and
47 percent of their total offense. 
The Tartans held Thompson to 
71 yards on 19 carries.
He was a hard runner, said 
linebacker Mike Hession. But 
there were five or six guys
around the ball on every play. 
He was bottled up the whole day 
and he had nowhere to go.
But while Thompson found 
little success running against a 
stingy Tartan defense, he exhib
ited his agility on kickoffs, with 
two returns for 106 yards. On
the games first play, Thompson 
turned on the speed, taking Fred 
Hardings kickoff 88 yards for a 
touchdown.
Adrian would not see the end 
zone again until late in the fourth
quarter. Down 13-6 with 8:30 
remaining, the Bulldogs came 
back with their lone offensive 
touchdown.
On the first play from scrim
mage at the Adrian 20, Holtz 
dropped back to pass, but found 
himself scrambling from blitz
ing linebacker Bill Yurkovich. 
Holtz desperation screen found 
the hands of tailback Craig 
Barnes, who broke several tack
les and darted 80 yards to nar
row the Tartan lead to 13-12.
Hession stifled Adrians twopoint conversion attempt, bat
ting away Holtz pass. We know 
that when you give up a big play, 
like that screen for the long 
touchdown, youve got to come 
back and try to knock the hall 
down on the conversion, said 
Hession. You cant give up.
The Tartans moved the ball 
well in the first half, but two 
fumbles and an interception
proved costly, as the Tartans 
were unable to put points on the 
board.
When we went in at halftime, 
we werent worried being down 
6-0, said sophomore receiver 
Jarrod Siket. If we hadnt been 
moving the ball, it wouldve been 
a different story. But we were 
doing what we wanted with the 
ball, and the only thing that 
kept them in the game in the 
first half were silly mistakes.
The Tartans took a 7-6 lead 
on their first drive of the third 
quarter. Freshman quarterback 
Chris Dee hit Siket on a 49-yard 
touchdown pass. Dee was mak
ing his first collegiate start, since 
senior co-captain Sam Mangano 
left the team after last weeks 
game against Duquesne.
I got by the [defensive back] 
and Chris threw a perfect ball, 
exactly on the money, right in

back at a 60 degree angle with 
the ground. There is a semicircle 
with a three-meter radius called 
the forbidden zone in front of 
each net. No player may be in 
this zone, unless he has just 
made a pass ortaken a shotfrom 
above it. The game is played 
with a handball (like a small 
soccer ball but with a softer sur
face). An official game consists 
of three 15-minute periods.
A player who has the ball may 
keep it no more than three sec
onds. During this time he or she 
can take up to three steps, but 
may not dribble it. If the team 
has made less than three passes,- 
the player can pass the ball. Last, 
but not least, he or she can take 
a shot at the net.
A shooter scores a point for his 
team if the ball, after bouncing 
off either of the nets, hits the 
ground outside the forbidden 
zone. If the ball falls in the for
bidden zone, or out of the field, 
the point goes to the other team. 
The same penalty occurs if a 
shotmissesthenet. Any foul (a 
bad pass or catch; more than

Defense in tchoukball is much
different from other sports. The

nor may it prevent any shot on the 
net.
So what do they do? you are 
asking. There isnt any action! 
Quite wrong! The defenders have 
to constantly move around the field 
to anticipate any probable shot 
from the opponent. This anticipa
tion varies constantly according to 
the other teams placement and 
passes.
This aspect of tchoukball en
sures that no two opponents 
crash into each other going for 
the ball at the same time, yet 
the game doesnt lose intensity. 
Since the other teams place
ment has to be taken into ac
count constantly and there is 
no physical violence possible, a 
tchoukball game has two teams 
playing with one another, 
rather than against each other.
Tchoukball is currently being 
played in the following countries: 
Switzerland, Great Britain, Ger
many, Austria, France, Korea, Ja
pan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Argen
tina, Brazil, and, since last year, 
in the United States (at Cornell 
University).

We were looking for a big play in the 
rst half, but couldnt get one, said 
)ee. We finally got that touchdown in 
the second half, and it sparked the 
team. Everybody came alive afterthat. 
; pred Harding added a 43-yard field 
oal with 1:53 left in the quarter to 
xtend the lead to 10-6. Harding had 
lD]y connected on one field goal prior to 
laturday, a 30-yarder.
' I felt pressure, but I tried to put it 
jf, said Harding. In the past I think 
[ let that get to me. Today I just calmed 
jown and put it up for the team.
; The scoring drive began after sopho
more comerback Jerry Fuller interiepted a Holtz pass at the CMU 42 and 
turned it 24 yards to the Adrian 34. I 
pas just dropping in my coverage, and 
ie threw it right to me, said Fuller. 
Then I saw all the offensive linemen to 
)ne side, and I said, Ive got to get away 
rom that before I get clobbered. 
; Harding came through again in the 
ourth quarter. His 35-yard field goal 
iut the Tartans up 13-6. Once again, 
he score was set up by an interception, 
phis time, sophomore comerback Jeff 
Jregor stepped in front of receiver Brad 
Smith and picked off Holtz pass in he 
nd zone.
| It was just like the play at Allegheny 
here they caught it for a touchdown, 
iaid Gregor. Coach Marelli worked on 
chnique with me in practice, and we 
hanged the route a bit so I was in good 
losition. When [Holtz] threw the ball, 
ye were ready for it.

A key to the victory was the Tartans' rushing defense, which held Adrians Robert 
Thompson to 71 yards for the game.
Pizzurro led the way. Marmol carried 
the ball twdce for 24 yards, while 
Pizzurro rushed six times for 28, in
cluding a five-yard touchdown.
We never doubted that we couldmove 
the ball against them, said Pizzurro. 
We knew they hadnt given up a touch
down all season, but we werent psyched 
out at all. We knew eventually wed get 
to them.
The touchdown put the Tartans up 
for good, 20-12. Adrians last-minute 
effort to tie the game was halted by
junior safety Andy Helms, who recorded 
the Tartans fourth interception at the 
Adrian 38.
Coach told us at the half, just keep 
up the big plays and keep playing them 
hard, said Hession.
We grew up a lot in the second half, 
added Siket. We played ball-control 
offense and you cant beat us when 
were playing like that.
The win boosted the Tartans record 
to 41 overall going into this Saturdays

Cancellation was the theme 
for the womens tennis team this 
week. Thursdays match at In
diana University of Pennsylva
nia was canceled, leaving 
Mondays match against 
Waynes-burg (a make-up of a 
previously rained-out match) as 
the only action on the schedule.
The Tartans made the most of 
the day, though, shutting 
Waynesburg out, 9-0, to improve 
their season record to 6-8. Car
negie Mellon won three of its 
matches  two singles and one 
doubles  by default as the 
Waynesburg team only had five 
players at the match.
In the singles games, sopho
more Whitney Weber defeated 
Waynesburgs Bobbie Jo 
Winsheimer, 6-1,6-2, and fresh
man Kinga Czerka defeated 
Lenda Daniels, 6-0,6-2. Sopho
more Sharyn Rotunno and se
nior Silvina Candia had even 
more impressive matches, 
besting their opponents 6-0 in 
both sets.
In doubles competition, fresh
men Stephanie Kukura and 
Cherie Lin won 6-1, 6-1; fresh
man Monika Czerska and sophomore Patty Kim won their 
doubles match by the same score.
The team has only two 
matches left in the fall season: 
on Thursday, the Tartans host 
Robert Morris College, and Penn 
State-Behrend comes to CMU 
on October 19.

The CMU mens soccer team travelled to 
Washington and Jefferson College last Sat
urday and handily defeated the Presidents 
by a score of 3-0.
We were dominant in all aspects of the 
game, said freshman Alex Amezquita.
Junior Terence Sibya scored about 20 
minutes into the first half on an assist from 
sophomore Min Chong. The goalkeeper 
was out of position, sol basically just walked 
it in, said Sibya.
The second-half scoring began with a
penalty kick by Chong at about the midway 
point. The kick was awarded because a player 
(other than the goalie) from W&J illegally 
stopped a previous shot on goal with his 
hands.
They [W&J] werent very good, com
mented Chong, and we kind of played down 
to their level. Added Sibya, We were an
ticipating a win, but we had to work harder 
than we thought.
The last goal in the game was scored on a 
hard shot into the bottom left-hand comer 
by sophomore Basil Ramzy off a pass from 
Amezquita.
Commenting about the game, Sibya said,
We managed to secure a decisive victory, 
but we couldve played somewhat better. We 
had many other attacks, but failed to convert 
them.
Added Chong, We played well, but not up 
to our potential. However, our defense did 
play really well.
The Tartans will host Gannon College at 
7:30 pm on Thursday to make up for a can
celed game against Point Park College last 
Wednesday (October 2). The Tartans then 
take the field Saturday at Gesling Stadium 
against Westminster College at 1:30 pm, and 
again on October 14 against La Roche Col

Womens soccer scores pair of weekend shutouts
By SARA BARTON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
soccer team enjoyed a success
ful Homecoming weekend, with 
shutout victories over both 
Washington and Jefferson Col
lege and Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania. The two wins, 
along with a 1-0 loss to Seton 
Hill College on Monday, gave 
Carnegie Mellon a 6-4 season 
record. According to head coach 
Julie Shackford, the team domi
nated both games.
During yesterdays game 
against IUP, the Tartan offense 
started off quickly; freshman 
Christina Isaly scored five min
utes into the game, and from 
there it was all Carnegie Mel
lon. The Tartans impressive offensive line made senior goalie 
Elena ChartofPs job easy, as vir
tually all of the first-half play 
took place in IUPs end of the 
. field. Senior Samara Lenga 
headed in a goal with 20 min
utes left in the first half, and ten 
minutes later followed up with 
an assist to sophomore Julie 
Paid.
The second half proved to be 
more evenly matched, although 
the Tartans remained in con
trol. Neither Carnegie Mellon 
nor IUP scored. Sophomore Tar
tan goalie Trish Henrich had a 
few solid saves closing the game 
for Chartoff. The final score was 
CMU 3, IUP 0.
Paul stated that the Tartans
style was intense from the start 
and was characterized by good 
passing and support among the 
players. Senior Elizabeth Zika 
described the womens play as 
aggressive, marked again by 
good passes and defense.
The womens game on Satur
day, against Washington and 
Jefferson ended in victory but 
proved, according to Coach 
Shackford, to be frustrating. 
Shackford stated that because 
the W&J soccer field is very 
small, the women felt boxed in 
and didnt explode for goals until 
the second half.
Paul, who scored one of the 
Tartans goals against W&J, 
categorized the first half as really slow. Our heads werent in 
the game, she said, but during 
the second half we got it to
gether.
The final score  Carnegie 
Mellon 5, Washington and 
Jefferson 0  is a clear indica
tion that the team did indeed 
get it together. Lenga contrib
uted three goals, while Paul 
scored once, and junior Sonya 
Chmielnicki connected on a free 
kick.
The Tartans will host Univer
sity of Pittsburgh-Johnstown at 
CMU on Wednesday night and 
Chatham College on Friday. A 
match against Chatham College, 
originally scheduled for October 
14, has been postponed.

The first of many intramural seasons 
ended this week: the co-rec volleyball 
championships were held on Thursday 
night, and the annual cross country 
meet was held on Wednesday after
noon in Schenley Park.
In volleyball action, the Networkers, 
SAE, and the Green Aces won champi
onships in the majors, intermediate, 
and minors divisions. The Networkers 
gained a first-round bye while the Rude 
Dogs slugged it out with The Side 
Oouutttss. The Dogs went on to the 
championship, where they were stopped 
by the Networkers, 13-15^16-14,15 
5.
There are a lot of friends between 
the two teams, so we played together a 
lot, said Networker Dirk Kalp, a mem
ber of the Computer Science staff. We
knew they had a good team.
In the intermediate playoffs, SAE 
took the long road, starting with a divi
sion tiebreaker against Pioneers A. 
After beating the Pioneers squad, SAE 
rolled past two other teams en route to 
a championship win over Cheese Blintz.
The Green Aces took the minors title 
against Miasma, winning 15-7,15-9. 
We had a pretty easy time in the play
offs, except for the team we played in 
the final. We had lost to them in the 
regular season, said Green Aces se
nior John Supp.
In the cross country meet, a new 
participation record was set, with 110 
runners participating in the event. Navy 
ROTC won the top position in both the 
mens and womens competitions.
Eleven teams ran in the mens race; 
the Green Aces finished second, fol
lowed by the Boneheads, Theta Xi, and 
GNC Supplements/CLA. Of the four
womens teams, Navy won the race, 
followed by womens basketball teams 
C, B, and A.
Junior Sean Pempel of the Green 
Aces ran the 1.9-mile course in 10:36 to 
win the individual title. Senior Karl 
Brower of NROTC (10:51) took second 
place, and grad student Joe Melvin of 
GNC/CIA took third with a time of 
10:53. Senior Bill Isaacs ofNROTC was 
the only other runner under the 11- 
minute mark, finishing the course in 
10:57.
Freshman Christa Sober of Basket
ball C was the top womens finisher 
with a time of 13:33. NROTC took the 
second, third, and fourth positions, and 
Basketball C senior Amy Buxbaum fin
ished the top five with a time of 15:08.
The old record for the cross country 
meet was 59 runners, set last year. To 
date, four new team records have been 
set this year.

Parade marshall remembers 1921
Dan Frey/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
Albert May (E 21) in the Gesiing Stadium press box.
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
At Homecoming, the idea of change becomes central to everything 
around us; returning alumni make us realize how much things 
change from year to year. For current students, reminiscing about 
Carnegie Tech in 1921 would be somewhat like landing on a 
different planet. Imagine a Carnegie Mellon that is almost com
pletely unlike today, a CMU without the Fence and without Buggy 
races. This was Carnegie Tech before 1921, and before a few 
ambitious and creative people decided that the school should have 
some traditions to call its own. Returning alumnus Albert May (E 
21) is one of the people responsible for making CMU what it is 
today.
May returned to this years Homecoming as the Grand Marshall 
of the Parade of Classes. As he watched the football game on 
Saturday afternoon, he offered some insight into what this school 
was like way back in 1921, in the midst of World War I and 
Prohibition, when Andrew Carnegie was still around and Arthur 
Hamerschlag was the president of the school.
Although May himself went to Cleveland to work for the Philadel
phia company after graduation, most of the 200 people he gradu
ated with went back to the farm to help out their families, he said. 
The war was on then, so all the students went to officers training in 
Plattsburg, NY and then came to school. There were no civilian
students, he explained.
After starting school at Carnegie Tech, themen of his class 
realized the school had very few traditions. They decided it was time 
to bring events to the campus which would make it unique. Cam
pus Week was started in 1919, and May served as its chair in 1920. 
The first Buggy race was held during his tenure. Sure, there were 
a few accidents, he admitted, but  the Buggy races were obviously 
a big hit! Another major addition the class of21 gave to the campus 
was the Fence. We built it from scratch, May says proudly. The 
Fence was a senior-class project that year.
According to May, the Beaux Arts Ball was already an established 
tradition, and the plays performed by the Drama Department were 
very well known. But another thing the school was lacking was any 
sort of songbook. The class of 21 started the songbook, and an 
architecture major, Robert Schmertz, wrote many songs like Fight 
for the Glory of Carnegie.
Group singing was popular in the fraternities. In Mays frater
nity, Beta Theta Pi, he admitted they had quite a few parties, 
however, since they went to school during Prohibition, there 
wasnt any alcohol snuck in, because you just couldnt buy it 
anywhere. The fraternities lived very much to themselves, he said, 
and they had no guests (except women) at their parties.
Living quarters in both the fraternities and dormitories were set 
up very differently than they are today. Students today shouldnt

Fight For The Glory Of Carnegie
Andy was the grand old man we loved 
so well, Carnegie;
In the land where thistles grow he 
used to dwell,
Oer the sea;
Members of the clan that bears his 
name
Struggle for its glory and its fame.
Fight! for the glory of Carnegie!
Fight! for the glory of the'clan!
Let your eyes be ever on the Tartan 
bright,
As we stand united evry man fight, 
fight, fight!
Fight evry loyal son of Skibo,
Fight til we win the victory!
The Kilties are coming, hurray, hurray,
The Kilties are coming, theyll win 
today,
For theyre fighting for the glory of 
Carnegie!
[A] speaker related to both young and old when he 
asked if anyone remembered how hard we worked as 
students... Some things never change.

Carnegie Mellon looks to future
Kostyo may have thought a lot 
about the times when her hus
band John (E 48) was a cute 
waiter in the womens dining 
room, but she also had some 
things to say about the current 
state of Carnegie Mellon. We 
miss the old ways, Kostyo said, 
but also admitted that it is for 
the best to move forward. She 
and fellow alumnus Shirley 
Fedor (MM 51) would have liked 
to see some of the programs of 
the Margaret Morrison College, 
like the dietetics and education 
they studied.
Someone who felt that the 
changes in the curriculum of the 
University were, on the whole, 
worth certain sacrifices was Bill
Wallace (E 48). He had this to 
say about Carnegie Mellon; It 
has become broadened ... engi
neering has taken a relative back 
seat. Its gratifying to see [CMU] 
still a front-runner in a broad 
field. George Gedeon (E 49) did 
not agree with Wallace. He said 
I think engineering has lost its 
status, mentioning that CIT 
was once ranked second only to 
another school with similar ini
tials, MIT.
The architectural make-up of 
Carnegie Tech has changed 
along with the curriculum.

Homecoming weekend was 
rich with the history of Carnegie 
Tech and Margaret Morrison 
College, as graduates from as 
far back as 1921 returned to 
their Alma Mater for Homecom
ing activities, which included a 
champagne reception, a lun
cheon, and a Golden Anniver
sary Medallion Presentation/ 
Reunion picture for the Class of 
1941 on Friday, and the Parade 
ofClasses and Homecoming foot
ball game on Saturday.
Jane Douden (MM 26) is one 
of the last members of a sorority 
called the Beetles (BTL) which 
is now Kappa Alpha Theta. 
There were no Greek letters,

10 pm curfew. Francis H. 
Turosak (MM 61), a former 
Delta Gamma vice president and 
Tartan staffwriter, said You 
could sign out for 45 minutes 
from 7 to 10. Tursoak and her 
husband Paul, who was often 
kicked out of the Morewood lobby 
at 10:30 pm, have not been back 
to CMU since her 25th reunion 
in 1976.
The Class of 1941 was hon
ored with medallions given by 
President Mehrabian at the 
champagne reception on Friday. 
The representatives from the 
Classes of 1926,1931, and 1936 
were given Carnegie Tech sou
venirs. Music majors Lawrence

During Homecoming, while 
everyone else remembered their 
past years on campus, picnicked 
on the Cut, or watched the Tar

President Robert Mehrabian 
was looking toward the future.
In addressing a meeting of the 
Andrew Carnegie Society Sat
urday morning, he outlined some 
of his hopes and dreams for the 
entire Carnegie Mellon commuto continue in the foot
steps of the previous University 
presidents in setting the stan
dard for CMU as a leader in 
research and education. For the 
alumni and benefactors present 
he described a Carnegie Mellon

anything but unassuming. 
Rather, he wants to further Car
negie Mellons ties to innovation 
and leadership both here and 
abroad. This is what he sees: 
Research that is practical, 
responsible, and beneficial, that 
continually supports industry in 
innovative ways;
Newly created science and 
technology, and math national 
research centers on campus;
A heightened awareness 
among Carnegie Mellon stu

ability to succeed in a global 
marketplace;
The continuing effort to im
prove our programs to the best 
that they can be through the 
introduction of special advisory 
boards;
A recommitment to under
graduate education, including 
new levels of undergraduate re
search opportunities, a,revital

of continuing education and in
teraction outside the classroom;

In 1941, tuition was $450 a 
year, buggies used bicycle tires, 
and dietetics was still a degree 
program at Margaret Morrison 
College. Since then, a lot of 
things have changed here at 
Carnegie Tech  including the 
name. It was these changes and 
old memories that surfaced in 
conversations among the mem
bers of the classes of 1926 to
1991.
When asked about Homecom

The following are excerpts from staff 
nteruiews with Student Body Presi
dent Hyun Shin and Vice-Provost for 
Education Erwin Steinberg:
Shin: I wish that more students had 
hown up [at Mehrabians address] be
cause I think it worth listening to.... 
Now, we know that the administraon has made a commitment to conuct a comprehensive investigation of 
urrent undergraduate education at
FUTURE, from p II
ersity and Performing Arts centers. 
These arent goals that we should 
ake lightly. Their ambition is one that 
havent seen equaled in quite a while. 
Im not the only one who thinks so. I 
sked Richard Elder (S 66), president 
f the General Alumni Association and 
Andrew Carnegie Society member, 
what his thoughts were, and this is 
what he told me:
I think it [Mehrabians address] was 
insightful of the problems facing Carngie Mellon in the 90s. The emphasis 
n undergraduate education is right on
Carnegie Mellon. We as students have 
to respond and make a commitment as 
well to maximize the benefits we can 
gain from the study. My philosophy is 
that life is what you make out of it.... 
Students have to take an active part in 
offering their input, in offering their 
effort, in offering their time, and work
ing with the other members of the cam
pus community to make things better.
I just want to see more students take 
more responsibility upon themselves to
make the University a better place. To 
maximize what we do, we have to have 
participation from all the members of 
the campus community, faculty staff, 
students and administration. We have 
to work in harmony to obtain the opti
mal result.... If we talk in one voice, 
then people will listen.
Steinberg: [There was a comment at 
the address] about what we were going 
to do to get the students more inter
ested, and I was kind of nasty in my
response.... I dont know how thats 
going to get done.... It was kind of ironic 
that a student would go and ask me 
what I was going to do about the fact 
that there werent many students there. 
You say that the students feel this, 
that, and the other thing, and I believe 
that, but they dont believe it very 
strongly if they arent willing to come 
out and listen and reply.... If anybody 
feels strongly about something, that 
person will turn up somewhere at a
meeting. For someone to say the stu
dents feel this or that and we didnt 
hear anything about it, all I can do is sit 
here and shrug. Come tell us. We pro
vide the opportunities.... Im not per
suaded if students feel this, that, and 
the other thing if they arent going to 
come out and make representation. Play 
both sides of the street.
Transcribed by Mike Lippert, Fea
tures Editor.
Mehrabians Initiatives powerless without student input, persistence
point, that it is in our collective interest 
to continue to improve.... The dyna
mism and leadership that came through 
in the speech are what I see and know 
to be Robert Mehrabian.
I dont want this to become all honey 
and roses, because its all fine and good 
to say nice things, but it is completely 
another to follow through with what 
you promise.
There are many questions, both fi
nancial and organizational, that re
main unanswered, that directly affect 
how well and how far Carnegie Mellon 
will continue to grow. The initiative is
there, but will the rest follow?
As students, we cant worry about 
funding. Were busy enough paying our 
tuition bills, so additional donations 
will have to wait. Nor can we settle all 
the administrative details, changes, and 
contacts. We have to trust these impor
tant details to our alumni, trustees, 
and administrators.
However, what we can do  and this 
is where I wax philosophical is to 
participate as best as we can in sup
porting, focusing, and directing what 
we would like to see our University 
become. We have the direction as exem
plified by our University president, but 
it all boils down to thisnothing ever 
happens on a college campus unless the 
students demonstrate that they care. 
All the outlets of communication are 
available  use them. Wouldnt it be a 
whole lot better if you could come back 
years after graduation and tell some
one that I helped make this happen. 
This belongs to me.
We have tried today in a small way to 
show what happens when students get 
involved. Former students like Albert 
May ( 21) and others have helped cre
ate what Carnegie Mellon is today in its
heritage and traditions. Students come 
and go, but their marks remain.
Now is the time to get involved. The 
opportunities have never been better. 
And when you are a few years older 
than you are now you wont be afraid to 
come back here and remember when. 
After all, isnt that what homecomings 
are for?

and will be following the commision

May values Tech
MAY, from LI
complain about small dorm 
rooms: in 1920, the men did not 
even havp individual rooms. In
stead, approximately 20 men 
slept in one large room, which 
was much like army barracks.
Carnegie Tech of 1921 was 
different in many more ways 
from the CMU of today. May 
said that football and baseball 
were very big back then, and the 
men were more athletic in gen
eral.
He also feels that Carnegie 
Tech was a lot more practical 
oriented than the school is to
day, along with being much more 
personal. Also, the faculty in 
the engineering schools had very 
close connections in the indus
try, especially Westinghouse,
which was a great benefit to the 
students.
Even when May was still in 
school, he could already notice 
the passage of time. Andrw 
Carnegie died in 1919, just when 
all the new Carnegie traditions 
were beginning.
May was the editor of the 
Thistle yearbook at the time and 
dedicated the book to Andrew 
Carnegie.
Even though May definitely 
feels that the current campus is 
completely different from his 
campus, there are still remind
ers of his time here, and we can 
all appreciate the traditions 
which he and his class brought 
to all of us at modern-day CMU.

When told of the building's 
upcoming destruction, Ruth 
Kennedy (MM 36) said she 
had worked in the building 
and I loved it here, in this 
building. Its too bad....Save 
me a brick.
One thing which seems not 
to have changed is the comJ 
mon philosophy of howto edu
cate. We were taught where 
to find answers and to get 
them ourselves. There was
no spoon-fed teaching, said 
Kostyo. However, she would 
like to see this philosophy 
spread to all levels of educa
tion. Education, she said, 
should be improved in lower 
grades, before [students are] 
even thinking about college. 
Everyone agreed that 
Homecoming was really 
great, and that it was like 
cominghome. Perhaps most 
important was the recogni
tion to those who made this 
Homecoming possible. I 
think theyve done a good job.
Intl fall festival coming up
By SHAZIA NAJMI
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The first International Festi
val will take place October 22 
through the 26. This event is a 
huge endeavor by the Interna
tional Awareness Committee 
that has taken a lot of planning, 
organization, funding, and most 
of all, volunteer time.
The International Awareness 
Committee is a new organiza
tion on campus. It came about 
because students and faculty felt 
that there was a large interna
tional contingent within the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
whose needs were not being ad
dressed. There was not enough 
exchange in cultural ideas. To 
alleviate this problem, President 
Robert Mehrabian set up a com
mittee, headed by history pro
fessor Peter Steams, ofl5 people 
including students, faculty and 
staff. The members thought that 
a fun and interesting way to 
increase cultural awareness 
would be to have some sort of 
fair or festival with amusements 
from all different countries. 
Thus, the International Festi
val was bom.
Festival coordinator Aliya 
Khan says that the major goal of 
the Festival is to excite interest 
in social, political and economic 
aspects of other countries. The 
theme this year will be the con
tinent of Asia. Asia was chosen, 
says Khan, because of the di
versity of the continent. Some
highlights of the festival are:
An international booths 
fair where students will present; 
information about 40 Asian, 
countries.
Oopalee Operajita, the in-: 
ternationally known Odissil 
dancer, will perform classical! 
Indian dance.
A food fair with exotic cui
sine from different Asian coun
tries.
A crafts and artisans fair, 
with activities ranging from 
Chinese tea ceremonies to henna, 
hand painting.
An education abroad fair 
where students can learn about; 
study abroad opportunities.

Akron Beacon Journal, a very interesting piece, appeared on 
page 1 beneath the headlines, Announce Wright Services Are 
to be Held at Home; Rev. Stephen E. Keeler May Come from 
Chicago to Officate at Rites; Name C of C Committee, and 
included a eulogy from Harvey Firestone, one of W.E.s Florida 
neighbors, and an account of how the chauffer found W.E. 
dead in the backseat on the return trip to the office from lunch. 
(The overall headline in the Beacon Journal, a Knight Ridder 
paper, that day was, Railroads Speed Up Building, pertaining 
to a $1 billion program.) Nelson, who had started out selling 
tools from the trunk of his car, died Easter Sunday, 1972. He was 
followed later that year by his wife Inez Marie Wind. (Bill was 
visiting us when the call that she had died unexpectedly 
came.)

DAmicos Place retains magic with style, grace
On his recent Astoria album, 
Tony Bennett sings Where Did 
the Magic Go? I often ask that 
question myself, then head down 
to Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield 
and walk into DAmicos Place 
for some welcomed evidence of 
the final lyric, the magic will 
never die.
On the crudest of levels, 
DAmicos Place has beer, people, 
and food, as do Silkys and 
Confettis, bars all too charac
teristic of our time: Too much
I empty space/ Too little style, too 
! little grace ... where did the 
! magic go? So what sets 
' DAmicos apart and gives it the 
' style, grace, and even magic de
void of most establishments to; day? Well, magic is a difficult 
thing to pinpoint, but lets begin 
; with the beer.
DAmicos serves many of the
 same beers as other bars and 
restaurants, but it doesnt come

in one of those plastic economy 
pitchers that are so often 
scratched and chipped. Instead, 
the golden beverage shimmers 
through a large, sturdy, glass 
pitcher. Lifting and pouring 
takes some effort, but the solid 
knock of heavy glass against the 
table or bar top is like the sound 
of quality which comes as re
ward after closing the door of an 
old Catalina or Packard.
Pace contributes to the magic 
of DAmicos as well. The food, a 
menu of excellent Italian cui
sine at reasonable prices (about 
$6-8 for entrees), doesnt come 
fast; nothing good ever does. The 
half-hour wait for an entree is 
broken up nicely by the arrival 
of a delicious salad, which comes 
with the meal. But if somehow 
the plate of crispy greens bol
stered by an array of vegetables 
and zesty dressing isnt enough 
to keep your eye off the swinging 
kitchen door for awhile, the re
mainder of the wait should not 
pass by slowly. Customers at 
DAmicos are nourished by just 
the right proportions of good 
music and good dialogue  an
other couple of modern-day rari
ties. The rich voices of Bennett 
and Sinatra, often accompanied 
by owner Frank DAmico from 
behind the bar, emanate from 
the juke box and waft through a 
din of conversation without chok
ing it.
Frank DAmico is a big part of
the magic. As a matter of fact, he 
started it all. I love people. I 
have a good time with people. 
Frank came over from Italy in 
1967 and says he would never go 
back. I love it here.
 Although hes been in America 
for 22 years, Franks roots still 
hold a strong influence over his 
accent and his food. When my 
linguini with white clam sauce 
arrived, I was impressed by the 
authentic preparation of the
garlic-laden olive oil may be a 
pretty big jump from todays 
LeMenu frozen meals. If this is 
the case, you might want to go 
with the array of hot and cold 
sandwiches available on the 
menu. But if its not the case, no 
one at DAmicos is going to look 
at you funny if you grab a piece 
of crusty bread and run it 
through the olive oil from a pasta 
dish, or through the rich wine 
sauce of the veal Marsala.

Tim Foster excited to be at Carnegie Mellon
BY TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffwriter
I spent a year in Kenya. With
out a doubt, that was the single 
most important experience of my 
life. That was my junior year, 
explains Tim Foster. Foster is 
the new assistant to the dean of 
student affairs. In just three 
months at Carnegie Mellon, Fos
ter has found that he has had 
many opportunities, like his stay 
in Kenya, that he would like 
CMU students to experience as 
well during their undergradu
ate years.
As an undergraduate at 
Dartmouth College, Foster ma
jored in geography and environ
mental studies. After he gradu
ated, he worked as an assistant 
director of admissions at 
Dartmouth. It was my fantasy 
environment. So it was really 
hard to say I gotta get outta 
here to Dartmouth. I left with 
so much sadness. However, he 
did say goodbye, and moved on 
to the University of North Caro
lina at Chapel Hill where he 
earned a masters in geography. 
Foster didnt know where he 
wanted to go next, but fate 
brought him to CMU.
The Heinz Corporation 
brought my fiance here, and 
thats what made me look more 
for a job here. Fortunately, there 
was an opening in the admis
sions office.
In a short time, Foster left his 
post in admissions for a job in 
the Division of Student Affairs.
My biggest fear was who I was 
going to be working with. I didnt 
know these people at all. They 
turned out to be a great bunch of 
people, said Foster.
As for why he took the job at 
CMU, Foster admits, I couldnt 
say before, T came to CMU be
cause CMU is the place for me! 
Now I can say, its an exciting 
place to be. I like the fact that 
theres a real commitment to 
undergraduate life outside the 
classroom.
Indeed, Foster is responsible 
for a vast array of programs that 
involve contact with students 
outside their classrooms. One of 
the projects whichhe enjoys most 
is his responsibility as organiza
tional advisor to a number of
working with representatives 
from student affairs is a twoway street. Just as student af
fairs representatives can ap
proach students, students can 
also go to Student Affairs for 
help. In fact, Foster asserts that 
campus organizations as well as 
individuals should feel free to 
come to them and ask for the 
type of programming they want 
to see on campus. Our whole 
key here is to respond to student 
needs. [However] we dont just 
want to be responding  but 
talking to them, explained Fos
ter.
One of Fosters biggest goals, 
which he shares with Student 
Affairs, is to create a sense of 
community at CMU. Foster
As for his personal goals, Fos
ter says hed like to continue 
pursuing his love for outdoor 
activities such as canoeing and 
camping. In addition, he hopes 
to travel to more adventurous 
places like Kenya. At the mo
ment, though, Foster is looking 
forward to getting married on 
Saturday to the woman who 
originally brought him to Pitts
burgh. On an academic level, 
Foster aspires to someday earn 
his PhD and teach in New En
gland. But for now, he simply 
says, Ideally, Id like to see CMU 
become a place where people 
want to come back to. It shouldnt 
be a place where people leave 
and never look back.

different campus groups includ
ing Earthwise, the Graduate 
Student Organization, and the 
Explorers Club. He feels that it 
is extremely important to inter
act with students on an organi
zational and personal level. Ob
viously, what we do is important 
in determining what life is like 
outside the classroom. I learned 
just as much, if not more, out
side the classroom as inside 
[when I was in college], said 
Foster.
However, Foster stresses that
notes that CMUs diverse cur
riculum and rigorous courseschedule often prevents students 
from getting to know many 
people outside their department 
or major. He says, CMU is like 
an octopus. Its very decentral
ized. Ive only been here for three 
months, but it seems that the 
traditions here have evolved 
separately. Community is a 
major issue to stress. Theres 
always been a strong sense of 
community everywhere Ive 
been.

ut is so bad it will make you scream
Inc.
teacher Jack Cabe (John Travolta) finds love with club owner 
(Mnda Fiorentino).
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
As I was driving to the North 
Hills last week to see the film 
Shout, that little voice inside 
my head was screaming at me 
like crazy.
Go back!
Dont see this film!
This movie is going to suck!
Do your laundry!
But I just kept on driving, try
ing to convince myself that my 
little voice was wrong, that 
Shout was going to be an okay 
movie.
So what if none of my friends 
wanted to see this film with me? 
I told myself, even if it was a 
free film? That doesnt mean that 
the movie is going to be bad....
S o what if it has J ohn Travolta 
in it? I reasoned, Look Whos 
Talking Too couldnt have been 
that bad of a film....
So what if the title consists of 
only one word? I thought, Ghost 
was a good movie, and it only 
has one word in its title.
But that little voice of mine 
wouldnt shut up. It just wouldnt 
listen to my reason.
Youre doomed!
 Movie Review 
? SHOUT. A music teacher 
teaches a boys school about life 
and rock n roll. Starring John 
Travolta, James Walters, and 
Heather Graham.
Youre doomed!!!
It just wouldnt shut up.
Well, Ive seen Shout and Ive 
lived to tell about it and you 
know what little voice?
What Stephen?
You were right (as usual); 
Shout did suck, big time!
I told you so! You should have 
listened to me!
Well I didnt, and now Im go
ing to pay for my mistake for the 
rest of my life. However, if I can 
convince just one person out 
there not to see this movie, then 
maybe, maybe, Ill' be able to 
sleep better at night.
You should have listened....
So heed my warning and dont 
see this atrocious film. Dont 
waste your precious time seeing 
this film like I did. Its up there 
with movies like Run, Days of 
Thunder, and Rocky IV in terms 
of being bad. No, wait, Im wrong
now that I think about it  
Shout is even worse than those 
films, none of those films had 
John Travolta in them.
Boy, was he the icing on the 
cake or what!
You see, having Travolta in a 
film is bad enough, but having 
him play a wandering Pied Piper 
music teacher is just too much. 
Youll understand what I mean 
a lot better once I explain the 
plot.
If you can call it a plot, that is.
Shout is set in the 50s in a 
dead Texas town in the middle 
of nowhere. And in this cradle of 
civilization lives a bad boy 
named Jesse Tucker (James 
Walters) who has been placed in 
a boys school/work farm which 
is run like a slave camp by school
master Richard Jordan.
Those boys looked old enough 
to be in graduate school!
So its work all day, work all 
night for Jesse and his buds, 
until Jack Cabe (Travolta) mys
tically appears with his subver
sive harmonica and becomes the 
new music teacher. Hes sup
posed to teach the boys.how to 
play John Philip Sousa, but in
stead decides to teach them how

When you first sit down to seeNecesary Roughness, youll probably expect 
o see more television stars try their 
hands at comedy and fail miserably. 
Sou also might expect the movie to be 
mother monotonous disaster about 
^brainless football players. But despite 
ts initial potential to be a flop, Neces
sary Roughness is actually a humorous 
novie with several good points.
The movie begins with a news station 
reforming the country that the Texas 
State University (TSU) Armadillos, 
ormer winners of the Cotton Bowl, 
ave been found in violation of count
ess NCAA regulations. The camera 
lien turns to Ed Generro, played by 
ector Elizondo, who comments on the 
enalties incurred by TSU. Because of 
s interesting perspectives on the situhon and his reputation for no-nonjense football, he is approached by the 
SU Athletic Department to put to
other a new football team after everyon the former team is expelled and 
1 of the coaches are fired.
Generro accepts the position and hires 
s old friend and former assistant 
ally Riggendorf (Robert Loggia) to be 
'he defensive coach. The two then em>ark on a mission to build an honest 
ollege football team from scratch; how
ever, this task does not prove easy, as
 Movie Review 
**Va NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. A col
lege football team struggles to get back 
on its feet after violating several NCAA 
regulations. Starring ScottBakula, Sinbad, 
and Hector Elizondo.
Dean Phillip Elias (Larry Miller) is 
determined to get rid of the football 
program once and for all.
Another major problem is the team 
itself. The quarterback, according to 
Riggendorf, throws like Edward 
Scissorhands, the wide receiver finds 
it difficult to keep his hands on the ball, 
and the place kicker can barely kick the 
ball five yards.
At this point, Riggendorf approaches 
Paul Blake (Scott Bakula of Quantum 
Leap), a one-time high school football 
hero, and asks him to play for the team. 
Since he never went to college or ever 
pursued his football career, Blake is 
still eligible to play in the NCAA even 
though he is thirty-four years old. At 
first, Blake is apprehensive but agrees 
to play when the coach tells him that he 
has never seen anyone throw a ball like 
him. But the team still has its prob
lems.
Just when Coaches Generro and Rig 
dont think that things can get any 
worse, Dean Elias informs them that
aae Kosemnai/^xssx raramuum i-iuiuies 
Paul Blake (Scott Bakula) and Andre Krimm (Sinbad) star as two members of a team 
of unconventional college athletes in Necessary Roughness.
many of their best players cannot play 
because of low grade point averages. 
These cuts leave the football team with 
a mere seventeen players. When Rig 
thinks that the football team is sunk, 
Generro decides to bring back Iron 
 Man football, a technique where the 
players play both offense and defense.
Next, when astronomy instructor 
Andre Krimm (comedian Sinbad) is 
persuaded to join, the team is almost 
complete. The team receives its final 
player when an incredible new place 
kicker, Lucy Draper (model Kathy Ire
land), replaces the worse-than-pathetic 
Armadillos kicker.
Throughout the movie, Blake endeav
ors to become a real part of the team 
and feel some kinship for the much 
younger players. He also tries to win 
the affections of his journalism profes
sor (Harley Jane Kozak) who is afraid 
that she will lose professional credibil

interesting way of going about it, isnt 
it? Kenny Blank in his first major film 
role, plays Tito.
To flesh that plot out just a little, 
Louie Kritski (Pesci) is taken to court 
on complaints brought by his slum ten
ants. However, instead of being sent to 
jail, Kritski is ordered to live in one of 
the apartments in his building for 120 
days, or until the building is fixed.
Unfortunately, Louies father (Gar
denia) threatens to disinherit him if he 
knuckles under the tenants demands

hold out, but, of course, eventually de
cides to make the repairs and confront 
his father in the end.
The Super was the first screenplay 
written by Sam Simon, who has previ
ously written and produced comedy for 
television. Some of his credits include 
Taxi, Cheers, The Tracy Ullman Show, 
and The Simpsons. Its a pity so little of 
his comedy writing appeared in the 
script of The Super.
Louie Kritski (Joe Pesci) confronts his father, Big Lou (Vincent Gardenia) in front of 
Naomi (Madolyn Smith Osborne), the Housing Authority lawyer who started it all.
As a matter of fact, the only thing I 
liked about the script is that Simon 
didnt insist on developing a romantic 
relationship between Pesci and 
Osborne. In almost any film these days, 
the dominant male and female charac
ters end up in bed together; at least 
Osbornes Bensinger remains 
unattracted to Louie, though she does 
begin to see him as a nice person.
Simon manages get every other clich 
in, though. The domineering father
figure can be found in Gardenia; how
ever, Louie sees his own situation in 
Tito, causing him to do a complete Utum in his way of thinking. So, in the 
end, Louie gets to give a theyre people 
too speech to his father. The tenants 
who hated Louies guts eventually be
gin to think of him as an all-right guy.

Ricochet strikes right on target
By NICOLE ALLEN 
& TRINETTE CHANDLER
Tartan Junior Staffwriters
Ricochet, featuring such tal
ented actors as Denzel Wash
ington, J ohn Lithgow, Ice T, and 
Kevin Pollack, promises to be 
one of the hottest blockbusters 
of 1991. Meeting every expecta
tion, this thriller includes ac
tion, suspense, and a weird sense 
of comedy. Ricochet is produced 
by Joel Silver and follows his 
other successful sensations (48 
Hours, Commando, Predator, 
and Lethal Weapon).
Ricochet takes place in San 
Genero, an upscale yuppie sub
urb of Southern California where 
the slightest controversy turns 
into an event fit for the eleven 
oclock news. When rookie pa
trolman Nick Styles (Washing
ton) sends Earl Talbot Blake 
(Lithgow) to prison, he is pro
pelled into the limelight of the 
media and is even hired as As
sistant District Attorney. Styles 
has it all: a pretty wife, cute 
kids, a nice house, and a presti
gious new job  everything he 
could ever want.
 Movie Review 
???? RICOCHET. After becom
ing an acclaimed public figure, a 
police officer comes face to face 
with the revengeful escaped crimi
nal who gave him his fame. Star
ring Denzel Washington, John 
Lithgow, and Ice T.
Meanwhile, Blake is left with 
nothing but the obsession of 
sweet revenge. In fact, Blakes 
sole purpose of living is to get 
back at Styles, which he seeks to 
accomplish after mastermind
ing his escape from prison. Pro
ducer Silvers penchant for vio
lence and gore is evident in the 
jailbreak scene.
After his escape, Blake, with 
the precision of a smooth crimi
nal, throws a monkey wrench 
into Styles life, bringing his rise 
to success to a grinding halt. 
When Styles finally figures out 
Blakes master plan, he enlists 
the help of his childhood friend 
Odessa, played by Ice T.
One of the greatest scenes in 
the movie is when, in the gritti
ness of battle with Blake, Styles
takes a moment to assure his 
beautiful wife that he loves her, 
and that he is fighting to regain 
the life that they once had to
gether. This tender moment dis
plays Silvers ability to blend 
roughness with romance with
out stopping the flow of the stcry. 
Although Styleswife isnt a welldeveloped character, the actress 
performs her role exceptionally 
well. She stands by her man in a 
time of adversity, and, in the 
end, her steadfastness is re
warded.
The movie ends with a cli
mactic scene of obligatory vio
lence. You may find yourself 
grabbing at your friends arm 
every few seconds, but youll re
main grinning from ear to ear.
The characters are interest
ing, complex, and original, and 
the background of the story is 
fascinating. Denzel Washington 
plays a fully-developed charac
ter who has risen to success, but 
who doesnt forget where he 
comes from. Although his child
hood buddy Odessa is a drug 
dealer, Styles still tries to keep 
in touch with him. The Towers,

Skibo Information Desk.
The Hoodoo Gurus, who in

Bramley, percussionist Mark 
Kingsmill, lead vocalist and gui

Australian band promoting their

Junior Julian Hollingshead, 
the AB member responsible for 
bringing the Hoodoo Gurus and 
others to campus, heard that 
the group was touring through 
middle agent Gary Hinston. He 
jumped at the chance to have 
them perform on campus.
I figured this was a really 
great opportunity, even if we did 
just have Jimmy Cliff here so

In preparation for the concert, 
Hollingshead arranged for more

over campus, and even in offcampus areas where a crowd 
might be drawn from, I did out

symbolize the fact that he has 
strong ties with the black com
munity, as well as with his par
ents. John Amos appears as 
Denzels preacher father, whose 
pride in his son lights up his face 
every time he speaks of him. 
The bond they share is touching.
At a time when Hollywood 
finds difficulty in casting black 
men as heroes, this movie is an 
exception to the rule. Denzel 
Washington takes control of the 
screen with sophistication. His 
presence onscreen, coupled with 
his good looks, makes him a force 
to be reckoned with. Scenes to 
watch for include Washingtons 
nude locker room scene, and the 
spoofs from the hit show Cops.
John Lithgow is surprisingly 
good in his role as a bad guy. It 
was hard to picture him in a role 
like this after his goofy role as 
Bigfoots companion in Harry 
and the Hendersons. Lithgow is 
compellingly believable as 
Blake. He displays his 
characters obsession in a realis
tically frightening manner.

more realistic flare. This film is

Ten dollars from the outside 
still isnt going to give us any 
profit. But that isnt the point of 
Activities Board. And three 
bucks [for CMU students] isnt 
going to scare anybody off, said 
Hollingshead.
Usually at least two bands 
perform during a semester, but 
this semester, Activities Board 
is trying for a third  EMF. 
Working this time with Decesare 
Engler Productions, the Pitts
burgh promoter responsible for 
booking concerts at such places 
as Metropol, Star Lake, and the 
Civic Arena, Hollingshead feels 
confident that EMF is a possi
bility.
Decesare Engler will be mak
ing a huge profit, and we wont 
be spending a whole lot. We have 
the space, were at a college, 
with an open standing room, 
were charging little for rent, 
providing the technical crew, and 
well save him money if we co
sponsor. Itll work out well for 
both of us, said Hollingshead.
If youve never heard the 
Hoodoo Gurus, or EMF, you can 
time in to WRCT to catch them 
before they get on campus. As 
Hollingshead opines, the Hoodoo 
Gurus are not as wellknown 
as they deserve to be. The people 
who know them love them. So 
see for yourself October 14 in

Guns N Roses latest albums deliver  surprisingly
gy jyHKE SHAPlKO
rjaTton Senior Staffwriter
please let this be another Milli 
Vanilli scandal. Please tell me 
that these are all cover songs, or 
that the music was stolen from 
some nameless songwriter in 
Botswana or something. Just 
don't make me accept that such 
repugnant jerkoffs as Guns 1ST 
Roses could have penned such 
undeniably good albums as Use 
Your Illusion I and II.
Its gotta be a trick. Maybe if I 
play the few sluggish tracks over 
and over and rush through the 
rest of the stuff on fast forward, 
the reality of the situation will 
somehow discreetly evaporate. 
No good. Not since I caught my
self tapping my foot to George 
Michaels Faith a few years back 
(I subsequently had the foot cau
terized) have I been forced to 
reconcile myself to such a Grand 
Canyon-sized dichotomy be
tween the quality of an artist 
and his or her material.
The songs are painfully good. 
By painfully good I mean that 
the music on these albums goes 
beyond catchy into the realm of 
pause-sniff-wow-thats-reallyand is hideously pock
marked by lyrics that sound like 
they were copied off the bath
room wall of a grammatical re
habilitation school.
The first undeniable point 
wthstands even the most cre
ative of rationalizations. Guns 
N Roses are simply good 
s6ngwriters. They know their 
chord progressions. Their melo
dies are strong and distinct and 
go exactly where they need to 
within the context of each song.
Oh, there are exceptions here 
and there, where Axl Rose falls

mark. And a few of the slower

ballads will have you raising an 
eyebrow and wondering what 
the band was thinking. But when 
the pitch of the singing falls 
within the range ofhuman sound 
perception and the guitar slows 
down to five hundred beats per 
minute, you realize that youre 
listening to future hard-rock 
classics that are going to be on 
the radio long after youre dead.
Guns 1ST Roses is by vocation a 
more hardcore rock band, fill
ing that limbo somewhere be
tween The Police and Anthrax. 
Yet the ragged buzzing of the 
electric guitar, though ubiqui
tous, doesnt distort the songs 
beyond recognizability. Musical 
spotlight is smoothly distributed 
between guitar, vocals, and per
cussion, and the result is wellmeshed tracks that are pleasing 
to both ear and soul.
And  good grief  there is 
diversity. Not content to vacil
late between spasmodic chaos 
and acoustic torpor as are typi
cal hard-rock bands these days, 
Guns N Roses shows the same 
exploratory whimsy that 
grantedimmortality to Led Zep
pelin andtheBeatles. Aside from 
the standard hard-edged rock 
pieces and head-flailing thrash
ers, there are a handful of (sur
prisingly well-orchestrated) 
slower ballads, as well as num
bers with blues or country con
notations. Theres even a rap.
But there is a downside to 
these albums  Guns N Roses 
is still Guns N Roses, which 
means that anyone popping 
these albums into his or her CD 
player is in for a lyrical turdbath.
Now, although I fully endorse 
the right of the individual to be 
an unrefined ass on the privacy 
of his or her own album, that 
doesnt mean I find lines like 
Too bad youre fucked up or 
Fuck you/Bitch any more pal
atable.
Guns N Roses are crude, in
sulting, death-obsessed, selfpitying, sexistpurveyorsofphilosophical hogfeedor, more suc
cinctly, a bunch of assholes. Its 
not simply a matter of rolling 
your eyes briefly while you sit 
through an otherwise enjoyable 
song. Nearly every comer of the 
albums is laced with the atmo
sphere of noxious, inarticulate 
hatred of this universe and pos
sibly several others.
If theres a central motif of the 
twin albums, its that of com
plaint. Im not talking about iso
lated lyrics here and there, but 
entire songs full of applied angst. 
The Use Your Illusion duo con
tains the sort of wholesale 
bitching that you expect only 
from sitcom inlaws  and even 
then, in less violent terminol
ogy. The Gunners grievances 
span the spectrums of subtlety 
and scope, ranging from the ro
mantic petulance of Locomo
tive to the somewhat more 
earthy Back off Bitch whose 
theme, I trust, is not elusive.
The paradigm of bitching, en
titled Get in the Ring, is found 
on the second album. This is in 
essence a rebuttal against the 
negative press coverage thats 
plagued the band as of late. 
Theres both general belliger
ence as well as mudslinging at 
specific people, such as Spin 
magazines editor Bob Guiccione, 
Jr. To his credit, Axl Rose isnt 
cryptic or vague. I got a thought 
that might be nice, he reflects. 
Id like to crush your head in a 
vice. PAIN!!! he elaborates

tion, but you could probably 
guess them anyway. Theres the 
girl (Heather Graham) who also 
just happens to be the daughter 
of the schoolmaster. And, of 
course, Jesse sets his sights on 
deflowering this particular fe
male, and, of course, does.
What else is new.
Theres the rock n roll scene 
where Jesse and Mr. Cabe wail 
out some rock n roll, which is 
actually pretty good, but noth
ing to write home about.
Especially since this is seen all 
the time on MTV.
Finally, theres the big end
ing where Mr. Cabe faces his 
crime, the boys rebel openly by 
playing rock n roll, and all the

helpfully.
And so the polemics fly. While 
I understand better than most 
that the press can be militant 
and demeaning and that Guns 
N1 Roses doubtless harbors a 
need for retribution, well, do we 
really have to listen to it? Take it 
outside, boys, and offthe album.
Granted there is some humor 
amidst the vulgarity. Hey 
whadya think hes tryingto say 
there, anyway? inquires a voice 
following the exhaustive tirade 
of Bitch/Bitch/Bitch/Bitch. The 
response: I think its something 
each persons sposed to take in 
their own special way. Well, 
chuckle chuckle fart and all that, 
but I still retain some skepti
cism about the jocular intent of 
lines like Get the money 
motherfucker.
And the complaining goes on. 
Theres complaint about love 
(Bad Obsession), complaint 
about drugs (Coma), complaint 
about rock stardom (Dont damn 
me), complaint about lost time 
(14 years), and general la
ments about the futility of life 
(Dead Horse). Bitch, bitch, 
moan. These songs are not ways 
to start off a Golden Grahams 
day.
When the group isnt berating 
everything in sight, the lyrics 
are neutral at best. Expressions 
are strained and uninnovative, 
and, well, allegory and poetic
1991 David Geffen Company 
metaphor are not exactly perva
sive factors, if you get my mean
ing.
But, damn it, the music is 
great.
There are two covers, one of 
Paul McCartneys Live and Let 
Die, as well as the Dylan classic 
Knocking on Heavens Door 
(presumably Axl Rose liked the 
connotations of death, or per
haps the idea of repeatedly hit
ting a piece of wood). Theyre 
both rather well doneits hard 
to really regard anything as filler 
on albums with over 14 tracks a 
piece.
Use Your Illusion I and II are 
both microcosms of contempo
rary tragedy (theres a lot of tal
ent out there, but nobodys re
ally sure what to do with it). 
What can one say? If youre a 
Guns N Roses fan, youve al
ready filled your pantry with 
these albums. If youre squea
mish about harsh language (or 
harsh thoughts), then youll 
want to keep clear of radios for 
the next few years.
But if you appreciate well-written songs and can stomach the 
bands obnoxious character, then 
youmay find yourself reluctantly 
conceding $25 to National 
Record Mart while muttering 
something about the scarceness 
of decent music these days.

The Coen brothers do 
it again in Barton Fink
By ALISON GREEN
Tartan Magazine Editor
The most recent film from the 
Coen brothers, the producers 
and directors of Blood Simple, 
Raising Arizona, and Millers 
Crossing, is neither completely 
comic or dramatic. It may even 
be the most critically-acclaimed 
movie with a completely elusive 
meaning. This year, Barton Fink 
became the first film in the his
tory of the Cannes Film Festival 
to win the Palme dOr (Best Pic
ture), Best Director, and Best 
Actor Awards. So whats the 
story? Well, here are the basics:
Barton Fink (John Tuturro) is 
a New York playwright whose 
new play about the life of the 
common man has brought him 
fame and success. Capitol Pic
tures, a large Hollywood studio, 
offers Fink a screenwriting con
tract. Despite his initial unwill
ingness to cater to a mass audi
ence, he accepts. He goes to Hol
lywood and immediately checks 
into the most repulsive hotel 
anyone could possibly imagine.
The first person Fink meets is 
his next door neighbor, an in
surance salesman named 
Charlie Meadows (John 
Goodman). Meadows is every
thing that Fink writes about  
the quintessential common man. 
As Fink spends more and more 
time on the writing side of the 
1940s Hollywood scene, he finds 
himself becoming closer to Mead
ows, who seems to be simple, 
friendly, and everything that 
Hollywood isnt.
The head of Capitol Pictures, 
Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner), 
tells Fink to write a wrestling 
movie. Fink finds himself trying 
to write the movie in the middle 
of a heatwave, in a run-down 
hotel, with writers block. So he 
enlists the help of a fellow writer, 
W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), 
who has been recruited by CapiMovie Review 
????72 BARTON FINK. A semi-successful playwright is faced with the 
challenge of writing an impossible film, while he has writers block and 
has to deal with his eccentric new neighbor. Directed by Joel and Ethan 
Coen. Starring John Turturro and John Goodman.
tol Pictures to write screenplays, 
to get a feel for writing a wres
tling film. The story of the devel
opment (and lack of develop
ment) of the script comprises 
most of the movie.
Then again, there are so many 
subplots in Barton Fink that its 
difficult to say which plot is the 
most important. Thats why any 
two people who have seen the 
movie are bound to walk away 
with different impressions of 
what the focus of the movie was. 
There are several reasons to see 
it, not the least of which are the 
seemingly never ending critical 
acclaim it receives and the fa
mous names in the cast. The 
Coens even brought back some 
of the most memorable actors 
from Millers Crossing.
Tuturros performance as the 
socially inept Fink earned him 
the Best Actor Award, and for 
good reason. You probably wont 
recognize him as the conniving 
and nervous Bemie from Millers 
Crossing, but his ability to play 
a person who doesnt have both 
feet on terra firma definitely 
comes through in Barton Fink. 
Goodman, of Roseanne fame, 
is everything you would expect 
him to be, and is hilarious as a 
door-to-door insurance sales
man. (People should thank me, 
he says in one scene.)
Mahoneys portrayal of 
Mayhew had the writers I knew 
in the audience laughing up
roariously at some points and 
pensive at other times. The 
Southern drawl and caustic wit 
of Mayhew are a little reminis
cent of Faulkner, and even if you 
dont know anything about
Faulkners life, youll under
stand the world-worn look of the 
character. Mahoney appeared in 
Moonstruck, Frantic, and Rus
sia House, among other wellknown films.
Although Barton Fink has a 
relatively small cast, there are a 
few actors who, like Tuturro, 
appeared in Millers Crossing. 
Jon Polito, who was the powerhungry Johnny Caspar in 
Millers Crossing, plays Lou 
Breeze, Lipnicks right-hand 
man and personal slave in 
Barton Fink. Steve Buscemi, 
who is easily recognizable be
cause of his Humphrey Bogarton-speed large eyes, was Mink 
in the earlier film and appears 
this time around as Chet, the 
desk clerk of the hotel. The 
hotels other staff member, the 
stereotypical half-dead elevator 
man, is played by Harry Bugin, 
who was Whisper in Millers 
Crossing.
Barton Fink is impossible to 
classify or explain; more than 
that, the movie is so open to 
interpretation that even asking 
a friend might not give you the 
whole story. You simply have to 
see it for yourself. The only sure 
thing about this movie is that no 
matter what you think Barton 
Fink is about, youll be enter
tained enough to enjoy it. You 
might even be confused and in
terested enough to see it a sec
ond time.
AB Coffeehouse to host 
comedian Steve Shaffer
By JENNIFER TURNER .
Tartan Junior Staffwriter Performance Preview
Comedian Steve Shaffer, 
who has wowed audiences 
across the country with his 
eerily accurate impressions, 
is making his Carnegie Mel
lon debut October 18 at 8 pm 
in the Skibo Ballroom. 
Brought to us by the AB Cof
feehouse, Shaffer promises to 
deliver a performance not to 
be missed.
Hailing from southern 
Philadelphia, Shaffer uses his 
childhood experiences and 
German-Italian background 
as material for his act. Shaffer 
also utilizes almost every part 
of his body in an effort to 
amuse the audience, and, 
judging from his rave reviews, 
he does quite a good job of it. 
Included in his repertoire are 
imitations of dogs, cats,

at 8 pm in the Skibo Ballroom. 
Presented by AB Coffeehouse.
Sylvester Stallone at his best (or 
worst  you be the judge), and 
Chubby Checker doing a rendi
tion of the Star-Spangled Ban
ner. He performs his act in such 
clubs as Catch a Rising Star, 
Comic Strip, Improvisation in 
New York and Los Angeles, and 
the Comedy Store.
When hes not on the road ap
pearing in clubs, Shaffer is per
forming on talk and comedy 
shows. His talk show appear
ances include The Tonight Show, 
CBS Morning Program, and The 
Merv Griffin Show. He has also 
been showcased on many com
edy shows as well. Shaffers long 
list of credits also includes concert appearances as the open
ing act for George Carlin, The 
OJays, Paul Anka, Frankie 
Avalon, Doc Severson, and 
The Beach Boys.
Colleges are not new ground 
to Shaffer, either. He has ap. 
peared at many college cam
puses over the past years, 
while touringthe country. His. 
comedy has been extremely, 
well-received, and audiences 
have been amazed at his 
physical and acting abilities. 
He goes at each impression 
with such energy, that at the 
end of the evening, the audi
ence is exhausted from trying 
to keep up with him. Because 
of Shaffers high level of en
ergy and enthusiasm, the au
dience cannot help getting 
caught up in his act. At the 
end of an evening with 
Shaffer, everyones humor, 
needs are bound to be met.

Joe Bob attempts to add some spice to his love life
you know what bums my bajuii? Its when they release the 
ijnovie to the video store before it 
.ver plays at the drive-in. I was 
pandering through Zekes Bait 
Video a couple weeks ago, and 
jgtne across this flick called 
dayboys Secrets of Making Love 
'o the Same Person Forever, and 
[ went Whoa! Which person are 
they talking about? And Zeke 
jidnt know diddly squat about 
t and so I ended up taking it

ve watched this movie four 
imes now. Its hard to follow, 
Jause it has this psychiatrist 
?oman with a breathy voice comineHting on the proper way to do 
thef)JdEl Flagrante Aardvarkus. 
But,1 as near as I can tell, there 
are six rules for keeping the perianent zip in your zipper. And 
Ill -tell you about them while 
iescribing exactly how they ap
plied to my own life.
Problem Numero Uno: When 
LoveMakmgHasBecomeaTime 
Management Problem. This 
reminded me of the time when I 
called up Wanda Bodine and 
asked her if she wanted to buy a 
six-pack or go out for dinner? 
And she replied, My life has 
become one big six-pack. And 
this was too heavy for me, but I 
knew what she was getting at: 
she had no time to be respon
sible for the six-pack all the time.
! The video solved this problem. 
iBr. Joy Davidson, the Marilyn 
Monroe soundalike psychiatrist, 
said that all we had to do was 
'plan a day together, somewhere out in the boonies, where 
we could relax and eat food that 
reminds you of your honeymoon

trip to Maui. I knew they didnt 
mean us to take that part liter
ally, so I bought two giant mus
tard pretzels to remind us of a 
convention I went to in Philadel
phia.
One thing I need to point out 
right here is that every roman
tic tip on the video is illustrated 
by a Playboy Playmate with 
enormous dinglebobbers. So 
when this lady shrink is saying 
stuff like Focus closely and 
Allow all of your senses to flour
ish and Be here, right now  
live in the moment, youre go
ing Yeah! Move a little to the 
left! Yes! Im with you! Yeehaw! 
But then, when you apply it to 
real life, its never quite the same. 
For example, in the video, this 
particular section ends with hot 
sex in a rowboat.
We tried the same thing out at 
Lake Grapevine, and Wanda got 
cited for disrupting a bass tour
nament. Also, we had to pick 
three fishing lures out of her 
butt. Other than that, it was 
pretty exciting.
So we moved on to tip number 
two: Putting the Spice Back Into 
a Routine Love Life. I told 
Wanda this one was gonna be 
tough, because what they sug
gest is you go out to your back
yard pool, put suntan lotion on 
each other, and let the child in 
you emerge. First they want

Once you realize that the textbook uses Playboy Playmates, the 
lessons in Secrets of Making Love are easier to understand. (Lingerie 
not included.)
you doing it on the water, now 
they want you doing it in the 
water.
I went to Target and got a pool 
for $24.95, but while I was blow
ing it up, Wanda decided she 
didnt want to get romantic in 
my backyard, because both sides 
of the pool would be touching 
the concrete steps on two other 
trailer houses. I didnt see how 
this matteredit wasnt really 
covered in the videobut fortu
nately they had a second option. 
Just stop somewhere and wrestle 
around in the back seat of the 
car. This we could do.
Appreciate each other like its 
the first time, the video says. So 
I thought real hard about what 
it was like my very first time, 
and I did it exactly the same 
way.
Wanda was furious.
We went on to number three: 
Recreating Romance. This is a 
good one. The video says you 
should set aside every Wednes
day night, call each other up and 
plan a meeting in some strange 
bar where you pretend like youre 
strangers. You hire a black man 
to play the saxophone while you 
do pick-up lines on each other,
go home in a limo, and get a 
massage from a Chinese lady 
with long red fingernails, then 
bare yourself emotionally.
This one was great forme. I set 
it all up. We agreed to act like we 
were strangers. So when Wanda 
got there, I was using all my best 
Whats your sign? stuff on her
 when in walks this straw
berry blonde with a couple of 
Fuji blimps under her blouse, 
and so I said, Nice talking to 
you, babe. Ill call you. And I 
picked up the strawberry blonde, 
took her home in the limo. It was 
great.
After I got out of the hospital, 
Wanda and I watched the rest of 
the video. Part Four is Gaining 
Positive Sexual Power. This is 
where the woman is supposed to 
act like a stripper. We skipped 
this part. It didnt seem to apply 
to our situation, ever since 
Wanda got the night job at Baby 
Dolls Topless on Northwest 
Highway.
Next we did Recapturing 
Spontaneity, where you have 
sex while youre riding a Ferris 
wheel. That would have worked, 
if we hadnt have chosen the 
Ferris wheel at Kiddieland. They 
just dont go up quite high 
enough. I think Mrs. Smithson 
is gonna drop most of the 
charges, though.
And finally, my favorite one
was Renewing Sensuality and 
Trust, where you take a bath, 
blindfold each other, rub a straw
berry all over the other persons 
body, blow bubbles in their face, 
put an ice cube on em, tie their 
hands to the bedposts and paint 
their legs.
Well, now that I think about 
it, who hasnt done that? I was 
hoping there would be some 
kinky stuff in there.
Also, they should have pointed 
this out on the video, but it helps 
if your partner unties the ropes 
after youre finished. I was in 
there for 14 hours before Rhett 
Beavers came by and released 
me.
W ere talking 34 breasts. Mul

Avalon
European immigrants were always told that the 
streets of America were paved with gold. Yet, upon 
arrival, immigrants discovered that although there 
was no metallic sheen on the streets of New York, 
America was still a magicial place. Life in America 
meant religious freedom and, hopefully, economic 
success.
Avalon tells the story of an immigrant family 
living in America, their daily struggles, the stories 
of their cultural heritage and the problems that 
bond them together. The movie, directed by Barry 
Levinson, realistically depicts the life of a Jewish 
family and their adaptation to their surroundings. 
The movie stars such renowned actors as Aiden 
Quinn and Elizabeth Perkins.
For a taste of culture and an endearing tale of a 
new American family, spend a dollar.

My Blue Heaven
My Blue Heaven is a comedy that spoofs Italians 
and typical suburban dwellers, as well as the FBI 
and their role in the Federal Witness Protection 
Program. The cast includes Steve Martin, Rick 
Moranis, and Joan Cusack.
Vinni, played by Martin, is an Italian gangster 
who agrees to testify against a Mafia head as long as 
he is accepted into the witness protection program. 
Moranis plays the FBI agent assigned to protect 
Martin.
 The witness protection program sends Vinni to 
live in the suburbs, and for someone who is from 
Little Italy, the adjustment is not an easy one. The 
$1 question is: will he be able to survive the suburbs 
as well as the hitmen who are out to kill him? Check 
out DH 2210 this Friday to find out.

Monty Python  The 
Meaning of Life
Why should you spend a buck to go see this film? 
Because it has no socially redeeming qualities, its 
packed with one riotously funny scene after an
other, and was made by the Monty Python gang.
The Meaning of Life spoofs the grand production 
numbers that are seen in other films. It satirically 
compares the lives of rich families to lives of poor 
families. Dont miss the contrasting birth scenes. 
When there is a birth in a rich family there is a 
machine that makes jackpot noises. After a birth in 
a poor family, Mom, played by Eric Idle, drops the 
baby while doing the dishes. Also keep your ears 
open for the song, Every Sperm Is Sacred. Ironi
cally, nothing is held sacred in this movie; the Grim 
Reaper is even laughed at.
So if youre feeling bummed after a tiring week of 
classes, go see Monty Python  TheMeaning of Life. 
Youll get plenty of laughs for your buck.

A Clockwork Orange
Only from the mind of Stanley Kubrick could 
come such a captivating and confounding film as A 
Clockwork Orange. And you can only see it in DH 
2210 this Sunday.
Based on the classic novel by Anthony Burgess, A 
Clockwork Orange is set in a dreary and dismal 
future, full of ultra-violence of the most gruesome 
kind. Locked in a struggle between his times and his 
conscience, Alec (Malcolm McDowell) searches for 
peace of mind.
At first a destructive delinquent, Alec attempts to 
mend his criminal ways through a special program 
offered at his prison, only to discover that society is 
not ready to see him reform.
Thought-provoking and moral-building, A Clock
work Orange is a timeless film that questions and 
re-questions societys backward tendency of passingjudgement on others. And it features Beethovens 
Ninth Symphony. What more could you ask for?

Hitchcock would be proud of Deceived
By ALISON GREEN
Tartan Magazine Editor
Deceived has been described 
by critics as a true suspensethriller in the Hitchcock tradi
tion. I went to the movie with 
visions of Vertigo with a female 
James Stewart and, to tell the 
truth, I wasnt far off the mark. 
Deceived has a lot going for it, 
including a solid performance 
from Goldie Hawn and lots of 
visually slick scenes thanks to 
director of photography Jack 
Green (Aria, Bird).
The plot is surprisingly pre
dictable, though, and Hitchcock 
never would have allowed that. 
He probably would have liked 
the basic premise of the plot  
womanmeets man, womaiimarries man, man turns out to be 
someone completely different 
since its a slightly rearranged, 
faster-paced version of Vertigo. 
Like its predecessor, Deceived 
keeps you doubtful enough about 
whats really going'on to keep 
you interested.

seems to have an ideal life: shes 
a successful restoration artist, 
has been married to a perfect

Roughness provides laughs
Paul Blake (Scott Bakula) becomes attracted to his journalism 
professor, Suzanne Carter (Harley Jane Kozak).
ROUGHNESS, from page LH
cause of a female player on the 
"teSHowever, their view 
quickly changes in light of the 
fact that their reputation is not 
the best, since they have, lost 
every game of the season so far. 
Draper farther proves herself to 
team by kicking a field goal 
from the fifty yard line.
The movie is highlighted with 
performances by Jason Bateman 
aS a halfback whose father owns 
half of Texas, heavyweight box
ing champion E vander Holyfield, 
and numerous NFL greats in
cluding Dick Butkus, Ben 
Davidson, Earl Campbell, Roger 
Craig, Tony Dorsett, Ed TooT.alT Jones, Randy White, Jim 
jtelly, Jerry Rice, and Herschel 
W-alker.
.Bakulas acting as the strongbut-silent Texan hardly passes 
muster, but Sinbad picks up 
' jyhere he left off in the hilarious
style with which he played 
Walter Oakes for four seasons 
on A Different World. Humor is 
further supplemented by Rob 
Schneider as a sports commen
tator. Schneider, famous for his 
character Steve, the copier man, 
on Saturday Night Live, livens 
up the movie with such terms as 
fumbleaski and fumbleaya.
Another bonus is the original
ity of the football plays. To 
achieve the most realistic-looking plays, the filmmakers en
listed the aid of second unit di
rector/stunt coordinator and 
former World Football League 
professional Allan Graf.
Graf, who worked with execu
tive producer Howard Koch, 
Junior on the football sequences 
for Heaven Can Wait 13 years 
ago, brought in Vince Costello, 
former defensive coordinator for 
the Miami Dolphins and Kan
sas City Chiefs, to assist with
the choreography and design of 
approximately three dozen 
plays. As intended, these plays 
add an element of realism to the 
movie while advancing the story 
line.
On the whole, the movie is 
funny, if you can get around the 
numerous clichs and the pre
dictability. Screenwriters Rick
Natkin and David Fuller do pro
vide the viewer with surprises, 
however few, and most of the 
acting is solid enough to over
look Bakulas performance. So if 
youre having a bad week, and 
you need a good laugh, pop on 
down to the Squirrel Hill The
ater and enjoy Necessary Rough
ness.

The Super sucks
.SUPER, from page LH
&b that almost insures that The 
i,Super will make enough money 
to-spawn a sequel. Simon man
ages to trivialize a major soci
etal problem without even being 
funny\Its especially ironic since 
director Rod Daniel says in the 
press release that It was hard 
to show those living conditions 
without exploiting them or ridi
culing them.
Unfortunately, thats exactly 
what The Super does. The dan
gers of the inner city are 
cartoonish at bestwho really 
cares if a slimy rich guy like 
Louie gets scammed in threecard-monte, or if theres dark 
liquid in his bathtub?  while 
the tenants problems are vague 
and undermined by Louies cal
lous handling of them. LA.. Law 
used a similar plot a few seasons 
ago; ditching the humor and 
having real problems (like ten
ants getting raped because the 
locks on the doors dont work) 
got the message across a lot bet
ter than having tenants serve as 
comic foils for Pesci.
Even more disturbing is the 
films tendency to pander to ste
reotypes. I can almost hear the 
thought process behind the 
script writing: There are lots of 
black people in New York, so 
whats funny about black people? 
They play basketball well. They 
strip cars. They dance better 
than white people. They drink 
screw-top wine! Sounds like 
weve got a movie. In fact, the 
film insinuates that the only 
reason Louie was convicted was
that the judge handling the case 
was black.
Then someone else probably 
gave Simon the idea of having a 
Mexican family in the building 
so we, the audience, could see 
some funny broken English 
jokes. Largo Entertainment 
probably gave that person a 
script of his own about some 
funny Klansmen.
The only saving grace of the 
movie (aside from a few camera 
tricks reminiscent of the televi
sion show Parker Lewis Cant 
Lose) is the performance of Pesci. 
He really is despicable as Louie 
Kritski; in fact, he almost does 
too good a job. Hes so loathsome 
at the beginning of the film that 
I found it inconceivable to be
lieve that he would ever mend 
his ways. In real life, I would 
have expected someone like him 
to just have someone bump off 
Osbornes character or demol
ish the building.
As an aside, I find it very tragic 
that an actor as good as Pesci, 
who won an Oscar for Best Sup
porting Actor for his role in 
Goodfellas, doesnt take better 
roles than this. On the other 
hand, considering the cash that 
must have been thrown at him 
after the incredible success of 
Home Alone, its not very sur
prising.
Well, in case you havent 
guessed yet, Id recommend that 
you avoid The Super. Of all the 
poor taste and mishandling of 
the problems of inner city living, 
its worst fault is that it just isnt 
funny.

Chariots of Fire
Im sure youve heard the song, now you can see 
the story behind it. This film tells the inspiring 
story of a group of Olympiads, competing early in 
this century. We get to know each of the athletes as 
we watch their preparation for the big day. The 
movie is also famous for its beautiful photography 
and scenes so moving youll want to stand up and 
cheer the competitors on. The film ran off with an 
Academy Award for Best Picture and with good 
reason.

Soap Dish
Soap Dish, a spoof on the behind-the-scenes world 
of soap operas, boasts stars Sally Field, Kevin 
Klein, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey, Jr., and 
Garry Marshall, along with lavish sets and cos
tumes. Soap Dish also has one of the strangest plots 
of any summer release this year. With twists that 
include a long-lost daughter, a sex-starved pro
ducer, and secret sex-change operations, the film 
makes behind-the-scenes more ludicrous than the 
actual soaps.
The cast does a wonderful job of not laughing at 
themselves while spouting some of the silliest lines, 
such as Sally Fields characters concern that a 
turban makes her look like Gloria fucking 
Swanson, a concept the aging soap star seems most 
anxious to avoid.
There is no deep metaphysical plot to Soap Dish, 
but who cares? Its an amusing bit of fluff that will 
make almost everyone laugh, especially those who 
cut Class to catch an episode of Santa Barbara. If 
you dont have anything more intellectual to do, 
spend the buck.

Backdraft
Set against the intrigue of blazing Chicago fires, 
Backdraft, directed by the insightful and ingenious 
Ron Howard, examines the powerful bond of broth
erhood.
Focusing on the lives of two firefighting brothers, 
the McCaffreys, the film fills the screen with the 
tension, strength, and endurance that can only 
stem from love. Kurt Russel plays the daredevil, 
hotshot older brother who tries so hard not to care, 
and William Baldwin  emerging from his own 
older brother Alecs shadow  plays the baby of the 
family, trying to make his place among his family of 
esteemed firefighters. Jennifer Jason Liegh of Fast 
Times At Ridgemont High fame gives an exciting 
performance as Baldwins love interest.
Together, the two brothers battle five-alarm 
fires and try to solve a frighteningly real murder 
mystery. The special effects are unbeatable, show
ing fire in a light never seen before.
For a film with integrity, remorse, humor, and 
passion, dont forget Backdraft next week at DH 
2210.

Pet Semetery
There are about two enjoyable seconds in this 
whole movie. The story centers around a young man 
who feels so guilty when his childs cat dies that he 
takes drastic measures to remedy the situation. He 
buries the animal in a special cemetery where 
nothing rests in peace. Next thingyou know, the cat 
comes back to life, but is no longer a sweet house
hold pet. Instead, the cat is now a vicious, snarling 
beast who enjoys killing.
Now you would think that the father would learn 
from his experience, but no. When his son gets hit 
by a truck he decides he can undo that too. Based on 
a Stephen King novel, this film runs an all too 
predictable course.
Two seconds for one dollar  you decide if its 
worth it to you.
