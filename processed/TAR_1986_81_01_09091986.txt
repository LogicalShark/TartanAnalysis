Tartan AssistentWondering what they're serving in the
artstore? Why are there Dining Service card
readers in the bookstore? It's all a part of the
new I. D. Card Account system that has
pome into use this semester. You are now
j>le to use a Val-i-dine Account at five new
cations that are not related to Dining
1 jprvices. The Book Store, Art Store,
Entropy, Margaret Morrision Co-op and
Scotland Yard are all a part of a brand new
network.
Although meal contracts cannot be applied 
towards purchases at these new places the I. 
D. Card Accounts can be used. To get one
* all you need to do is go down to the cashier's
^ with any multiple of fifty dollars.
4 A$t tell them that you want to put this in a
Val-i-dine account and take the receipt to the 
contract office in the basement of Skibo. 
Within a few days the money will be credited 
and you can use your I. D. Card to buy those 
things that are held inalienable by every
* 'college student: Books, Chocolate Bars and 
Caffeine.
Although there were originally plans to set 
up an entirely new system the holders of the 
Val-i-dine patents, Griffen Techologies, and
Auxiliary Services could not come to a 
mutual agreement on the new system. 
Griffen Technologies only rents out their 
systems. Even then they charge a very high 
first year fee. In the years following the 
first, one-third of the original rental fee is 
paid to Griffen every year. This made an
entirely new system quite expensive.
At this point Oscar Mayer, the head of 
Auxiliary Services, looked over our present 
system again. It was seen that it would be 
possible to add a few more terminals to the 
present system and so Auxiliary Services 
decided to begin an experiment. Over the
Health Services are revamped 
and remanned '

An increasing number of complaints 
about CMUs Health Services prompted 
Student Affairs to re-evalute the program. 
Questionnaires were distributed to 600 
students, and students were asked to 
complete surveys when visiting the Health 
Center. In addition, a task force was formed 
by a Pitt professor associated with SUPA, 
and a professional consultant was brought in 
to discuss the problems with some 60 
students.
Donna Morosky, the director of health 
education and a fitness instructor for CMU, 
said ihe Students seemed "dissatisfied with 
the run-around, not getting answers, and the 
doctors not seeming to know what was 
wrong." As a result, the health
program has been restructured. The 
"biggest, most immediate change" according 
to Morosky is in the hospital services 
provided. CMU is no longer affiliated with 
Shadyside Hospital, because the service 
wasn't acceptable. Now CMU's Health 
Center is serviced by University Health 
Services,network; made ap of Presbyterian. 
McGee Women's, Western Psychiatric and 
bye ^ Ear hospitals and the Falk Clinic. 
Presby's emeigC.'ipv room will have an 
attending doctor 24 hours a !?ay for CMU 
students, to keep them from waiting a 
time.
The on-campus health center will have 
extended hours of 8 am - 8 pm Monday
through Friday and 1 pm - 4 pm Saturday. 
All of the doctors have been replaced and the 
new doctors will be in the center mornings 
and after 5 pm. Physician's assistants will 
be available when the doctors aren't. PA's 
have more schooling than registered nurses 
and are allowed to do diagnostic work and 
write prescriptions with the doctors 
knowledge. Two nurses have been retained 
because the student's have been "extremely 
pleased with them." Also, Presby will 
provide back-ups should the doctors or 
nurses not be able to work.
Other plans for the health center include a 
new appointment system, where students 
will get to see the doctors for as long as they 
need to, and won't have to wait so long. 
Also, CMU has submitted a proposal to 
Kellogg Corp. for a $300,000 grant to 
remodel the existing cenier in E-tower into a 
state-of-the-art facility.
Morosky feels that health education and 
awareness aren't stressed enough at CMU, 
and has started an awareness council. RA's 
have already recieved extensive instruction in 
general areas of health, including sexuality, 
eating disorders, and basic first aid. She 
would like to see more workshops, 
programs, and selt-diagiiCSi!C i*ids available 
to the students. The Awareness Council 
will also put out a wellness newsletter' on 
health topics of general interest.
Anyone interested in learning more about 
the .^r-alth Center or the Awareness Council 
is encourageu iP call Donna Morosky at 
x2075. .Brad Walter announces the opening of the revamped Health Center.
summer the Logging Card Readers were 
added into the new locations, as well as data 
lines to link with the computer housed in 
the Dining Service Contracts office. Even 
that may change soon, as the Cashiers office 
will probably take over the I. D. Card 
accounts so that it will be made even easier 
to add money to your account.
You may have also seen that there are other 
Card Readers that have been added to the 
campus. Doors similar to the one at the 
Margaret Morrision Laundry Room have 
been installed in Donner and Mudge Halls. 
These were added to help security within the 
buildings. They will also help to relieve the 
Desk Attendents who were often called upon 
to open the doors to residents who did not 
wish to carry their keys but retained their I. 
D.'s. They are also considering a second 
desk to be created for E-tower residents that 
will presently delay a Card Reading Door for 
Morewood Gardens.
If you've been having problems with the 
door readers, help is on the way. Last years 
batch of I. D.'s have a defective lamination 
and it may be causing a problem with the 
Card Readers. Dining Service will replace 
your I. D. free of charge but you will be 
asked to turn in your old I. D.

HOW TO CREATE A COUNTRY 
WITHOUT A KING
THE BIGGEST POLITICAL STORY OF THE LAST 200 YEARS
Nations have different 
strengths. Military or indus
trial might. Mineral wealth. 
Population for some, sheer 
size for others. History 
teaches us, however, that 
character survives, princi
ples last. The government of 
the United States of America
on the CBS Network, Part 
II of the life of George 
Washington: The Forging 
of a Nation.
Based on James 
Thomas Flexners Pulit
zer Prize biography, it 
shows how Washington 
proved that a country could
EORGE WASHINGTO

Sunday and Monday, September 21 and 22 on CBS
Barry Bostwick and Patty Duke return in their roles as 
George and Martha Washington
is now one of the oldest on 
Earth and, by any measure, 
surely one of the best.
The U.S. Constitution 
set forth the principles 
which embody the charac
ter of this nation. And as 
we near the bicentennial of 
this great document, it is 
clear: The more we under
stand the principles of free
dom it set forth, the more 
surely those principles will 
endure.
In this spirit, General 
Motors is proud to present,
have a head of state who 
was not a king. Personal 
and political currents 
swirled around him. Thom
as Jeffersons concern for in
dividual rights clashed with 
Alexander Hamiltons sup
port for a strong central gov
ernment. The French were 
demanding that our new gov
ernment take their side 
against England. At the 
same time there was open 
rebellion in the countryside 
and bitter criticism in the 
press.
The principles of 
freedom were being test
ed by reality. And through 
it all, Washingtons mod
erate approach to the Pres
idency was defining the role 
of Chief Executive for the 
generations to come.
History makes perspec
tive possible. With the pres
ent and future in mind, 
General Motors is proud to 
present this period of the 
American past. It is human, 
dramatic, and without ques
tion, the biggest political 
story of the last 200 years.
We hope you and your 
family will join us on Sun

Monday, September 22 for

Excellence presentation,

Around Campus:
Freshmen, take heed! You are not alone by any means. There are others just like you who find the buildings of this 
university highly confusing also. Misery loves company.
These descriptions are the result of days of wandering the campus, searching out every oddity and every point of 
interest in the curious architecture of CMU. They may not be informative, but it is hoped that they are at least amusing.
-Todd Belton (Freshman)
SCAIFE HALLSupposedly, the College of Science and the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology have their headquarters here. Pretty good for 
such an inconspicuous building.
HAMMERSCHLAG HALLHammerschlag to us 
German students means the blow of a hammer, which 
is, of course, totally irrelevant. How many basements 
does it realy have?
GRADUATE SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ADMINISTRATIONWith a name like that, it is doubtful that any further description 
is necessary, or even possable.
DOHERTY HALLMany have sighed with relief upon reaching 
this building after a long bout with Wean. How can you tell 
when you've made it here? By the noticable friendliness of the 
walls.

By LAURA LIND
Are you feeling confined to the CMU campus? Tired of the UDS 
scene? Your troubles are over.
CMU is not only a great school because of its high academic quality 
and campus life. It is also great because it is within walking distance of what 
the readers of Pittsburgh Magazine named the city's three best neighborhoods 
of 1986: Oakland, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill.Most of you are probably pretty fainilar with Oakland, not only 
because it is so close, but because it has so many interesting places in which to 
browse or just "hang out." However, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill also have 
shopping areas and are terrific neighborhoods, too.
Shadyside's main shopping area is located on Walnut Street. The 
stores sell just about anything from hardware to fine clothing. It is a good 
place to shop for unusual gifts. If you need a card to accompany a gift, Kards 
Unlimited has an extremely large, varied card selection; there is a card for even 
the most bizarre people.Another attribute of Shadyside is that its restaurants have good reputations. (If you like Italian food, be sure to visit Pasta Piatto.) While on 
the subject of food, if you want some of the best baked goods you have ever 
eaten, go to Prantl's Bakery. Here is a warning, however: if you are on a diet, 
you should definitely not go to Prantl's. You should probably not even walk 
past it; the smell alone could could make you want to devour at least a dozen 
doughnuts.In addition to all of these wonderful qualities, Shadyside seems to 
possess a certain "classiness." Walnut Street is a nice place to take a leisurely 
walk. ,After you have visited Shadyside, why should you stop there? Squirrel 
Hill also has a lot to offer.Squirrel Hill has its shopping area on the intersecting Forbes and 
Murray Avenues. Because of the large number of Jewish residents, many of 
the stores, such as the Pastries Unlimited bakery and the Prime Kosher 
market, sell Kosher items. Shoppers in Squirrel Hill can also enjoy bagels made at Bageland on Murray. This is the place to go for delicious, often hotfrom-the-oven bagels.Murray Avenue also has stores and restaurants representing other 
ethnic groups. For instance, there is a Mediterranean market/bakery, as well as 
a few Chinese restaurants. If you are not in an experimental mood and just 
want pizza (again), try Mineo's; the readers of Pittsburgh Magazine voted its 
pizza the best in the city. It is far better than anything that has been sitting for 
an hour in a cardboard box before arriving at your dorm.While Murray Avenue has most of the "food stores," Forbes Avenue is 
more like Walnut Street. It has more clothing and gift stores than does Murray. 
A point of interest for anyone even slightly interested in buying records is 
Record Rubble, a small record store in the basement of the Spa Lady building. 
This is where you can get a wide variety of used records at very low cotst, 
guaranteed against scratches.Another of the many things available in Squirrel Hill are the theaters: 
the Manor and the Squirrel Hill. They both show current films, but the 
Squirrel Hill often shows exclusive foreign films. These theaters should be appealing, considering the future closing of the Downtown theaters.
Squirrel Hill, while bigger in area than Shadyside, still retains its 
neighborhood appeal. Shopping in a mall just isn't the same.This article has only highlighted a few of the many entertaining points 
of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. Your tour of these neighborhoods is not yet

Art Prof. at ROTC
This summer Bruce Carter visited three 
Carnegie Mellon students from the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps detachment 
on campus during their stay at Fort Bragg, 
NC. These students were attending an Advanced Camp, a program for all future 
officers from all colleges and universites in the summer between their junior and senior 
year.Professor Carter visited with Dominic 
Coletti, CE; Donna Nyzio, Art and Douglas Zaenger, CE at Fort Bragg from 30 June to 
3 July. While there, he observed over 3,500 students from Maine to Peurto Rico participating in Land Navigation, Water 
Survival, Orienteering, Patrol Techniques, 
Tactics, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical 
Defense, Signal Operations and the 
Leadership Reaction Course.
The purpose of the Advanced Camp is to 
give students the opportunity for six weeks 
of intensive "hands-on" exposure after three 
years of classroom instruction. Professor 
Carter stated the training was an "intensive, demanding experience, which is both 
mentally and physically fatiguing, and 
focuses on the responsibilities of leadership.
Self-discipline was constantly underlined and tested in stressful training situations." 
After seeing our cadets in action, Professor 
Carter stated: "I was extremely proud of the 
Carnegie Mellon Cadets. The cadets were 
outstanding representatives of our school."For the upcoming year, Doug Zaenger will 
be the Commander, with Dee Nyzio as his 
executive officer and Dom Coletti the 
operations officer.

Burning the midnight oil may be necessary. Burning the 2:00 or 3:00 or 4:00 AM oil is absurd. Especially when an HP calculator can get the answers you want  in time to get a good nights 
sleep.For instance, our HP-15C Professional Scientific Calculator has more built-in advanced math and statistical power than any other calculator. Our HP-41 Advanced Scientific Calculators have even more potential.
Thats because there are better than 2500 software packages available for them  more than for any other calculator.Theres even a special plug-in software package (we call it the Advantage Module) thats designed to handle the specific problems an engineering student has to solve in his, or her, course work.No wonder professionals in engineering and the physical sciences widely regard HP calculators as the best you can get.So check one out.

Hammerschlag: Discrace or Pride of CMU Campus
By KEVIN KIM 
Tartan Staffwriter
Every place must have its downfalls. 
Baseball has the Pirates, Football has the 
USFL, Ohio has Clevland, the United States 
has New Jersey and CMU has Hamerschlag 
House. Yes, the wonderful 'Schlag, were 
would we be without it? The prison-style, 
cinder block walls enhance 'Schlag's special 
atmosphere. In angleing the rooms, the 
architect has maximized the discomfort and 
minimized the space. But look on the bright 
side: next year the cinder-block walls may 
actually get covered with plaster. Followed 
by new carpeting replacing the shFedding 
fabric on the floors. The new residents of 
the 'Schlag have become so overwhelmed by 
their rooms as to forsake them and live in 
the lounge. Yes, undeniably, Hammerschlag 
is the armpit of the school. It's even begun 
to take on the aspects of an uncared armpit: 
a nauseating odor and a steamy, humid 
atmosphere.
Armpits. What's so bad about
armpits? To put it in a nut shell, they smell 
and sweat. Armpits cause extreme
discomfort for their owners and the people 
associating with them. At inconveinant
times, armpits can cause extreme
embarassment and humiliation. Armpits 
cause so much grief, their owners should 
have their armpits surgically removed.
Like armpits, the 'Schlag smells. 
This is not the fault of the custodial staff; 
the 'Schlag just possess a special, individual 
personality. The 'Schlag has caused extreme 
discomfort with its residents and visitors. 
I'm quite sure that the Housing Office and 
the Administration don't take great pride in 
Hamerschlag House. Dispite what other 
dorm residents say, Hamerschlag is the 
armpit of the school and should be 
permenantly removed from campus. Perhaps 
another college in the area will want it
Armpits. What's so good about 
armpits? To think about it, there are quite a 
few' good deeds armpits have done for 
society. If it wasn't for armpits, where 
would you put your deodorant? Think about 
it. A world without armpits is a world 
without deodorant. Thousands of deodorant
related jobs would no longer exist. Where 
deodorant soaps go? The entire ideal of an 
individualized smell would be replaced with 
the concept the uniform odor of society. 
The very ideal is communist in thought; the 
American idealolgy is threatened. A million 
dollar industry would collapse; thousands of 
people would be unemployed, living on the 
streets; if armpits didn't smell and sweat. 
That's impressive, but there's more.
Flap your arms up and down. First 
make sure no one's watching, then flap your 
arms. Pretty simple, right? Thank you 
armpits. Yes, due to the wonderful work of 
evolution and a little heredity, you can move 
your arms at the shoulder. If you had a 
mound instead of a pit under you shoulder, 
you arms would be sticking straight out or 
straight up. How much are you willing to 
pay for this flexiblity? A hundred dollars? 
A thousand? Believe it or not, you recieved 
this fantastic ability for free. That's right, 
you were bom with it. What more could 
you ask?
______The 'Schlag serves a greater purpose
than to make its inhabitants miserable. The 
'Schlag allows Housing to dump those who 
are late with Housing forms into a dorm. It 
is the first step to telling young freshmen 
that life doesn't always serve the best and 
worse things are yet to come. Perhaps the 
'Schlag doesn't offer total flexibilty to its 
inhabitants, but in University Housing, one 
must follow University rules. The 'Schlag 
serves many needs, but not all of those for 
its residents.
I guess it comes to the necessity of 
armpits. Sure they can cause discomfort and 
embarrassment, but isn't the price of 
employing thousands, differentiating our 
capitalist belief from a communist belief and 
being able to move our arms at the shoulder 
worth the cost? The world needs armpits. It 
all boils down to that simple fact. Ohio 
wouldn't be the same without Clevland, or 
Baseball without the Pirates, or the United 
States without New Jersey. Well, we can do 
without the USFL. Overall we need the 
armpits of the world. As long as that is 
true, I guess CMU will always have the 
'Schlag._______________________________________

The Tartan has Joe Bob! !
By joe Bob Briggs
Drive-In Movie Critic
OK, let's put all this in perspective about 
Hershel Walker bringin his $5 million hiney 
to Dallas to play for the Cowboys. As soon 
as Tex "No, Really, I Always Talk This Loud" Schramm announced he was givin the 
Hershman all that dough, Tony "Special 
Education" Dorsett immediately said he eith
er wanted a million dollars or else he was leavin town.
Joe Bob At the Drive-In
Tony, this column's for you. Just calm 
down a little bit. I wanna explain this in 
terms you can understand.
First, let's look at the salaries.
The Hershman made a deal that says the 
first year he plays football for the Cowboys, 
he will receive a base salary equal to the gr
oss national product of France.
Tony, you're right, he's ahead of you there. 
Your annual salary is only the gross national 
product of Sweden. If you're nice to Tex, th
ough, he might toss in one of the little 
South American countries just to even it up 
a little bit.
Second, the Hershman gets the use of a 
1986 Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader during the 
season. Tony only gets a demo. Her name is 
Tami.
Third, if the Hershman rushes for 1,000 
yards or more this year, he'll receive title to 
the state of Idaho. Tony has no bonus clause 
in his current contract. 0
Fourth, the Hershman isnt claimin any 
family members on his W-2. This means 
he'll actually make less than Tony, UN
LESS Tony agrees to pay United States in
come taxes this year. Tony currently claims 
178 people as "dependents," including one en
tire branch office of H&R Block.
If the Hershman rushes for 2,000 yards, 
then he gets a new set of front teeth. Tony re
ceives no bonus dental work.
Finally, if the Hershman leads the 
Cowboys to the Super Bowl, then he gets 
what he's always wanted his whole life. He 
gets to sit up front with the pilot on the 
team plane and steer. (He won't really be 
steering, but don't tell him, it'll spoil it.)
Tony, no matter what he does, will NOT 
be allowed to steer. That's why Tony is de
manding to be paid $5 million, spread over a 
five-year period. "That comes to eight or 
nine hundred thousand a year," said Tony.
But Tony is just gonna have to learn  we 
can't ALL steer the plane. And if he asks 
why it is that Hersh gets to do it and he doesn't, the answer is very simple:
Cause Hersh ASKED FIRST.Nyah nyah nyah.
Speaking of intelligent, responsible grown
ups, Anna Chappell is this creepy mushface 
old Bette Davis lady named Evelyn that runs 
the Mountaintop Motel in Mountaintop 
Motel Massacre, the movie that, as we all 
know, is the latest from Jim McCullough, 
the second greatest filmmaker in the whole 
state of Arkansas. Jim wrote the ad that 
says, "Dont disturb Evelyn . . . She already 
is!" The old bag kills her little girl with a 
Commie sickle before there's five minutes 
gone, and then one by one the entire 
membership of the Screen Actors Guild, Ar
kansas Chapter, checks into this old ram
shackle motel up in the Ozarks and gets 
turned into Chicken McNuggets.
Evelyn spent three years in the Arkansas St
ate Mental Hospital, but they couldnt cure 
her of bad gardening habits, like WeedEating the guinea pigs. And she keeps a lot 
of weird knickknacks in her closet  old corn
cob pipes and Aztec gods and rubber 
dollbabies and stuff like she's been shoppin 
up around Eureka Springs at one of those 
places that says "Hillbilly Souvenirs" on the 
front door, only she bums candles around the 
knickknacks doen in this underground tunnel 
and says stuff like "I summon thee!" only 
we don't ever see who thee is cause they 
didn't have enough money to build one.
Anyhow, they dont really find out about 
the Dollbaby Shrines till the end, after shes
Future meat in Mountaintop Motel Massacre
gone around stickin snakes in the rooms and 
dumpin cockroaches and rats everywhere and 
the poppin up out of holes in the floor and stickin garden tools through their faces. This 
has happened to me at quite a few sevendollar-a-night motels in the Midwest.
What we got here is: One breast. Seven 
dead bodies. Three quarts blood. Electro-heart 
massage. Sickle in the face. Sickle in the 
chest. Sickle in the neck. Bad Loretta Lynn 
imitation. Snake striking wimp in the eye. 
Stuffed bobcat in attack position. Dollbaby 
Shrine. Gratuitous gardening. Gratuitous 
"Help Me Make It Through the Night." Head 
rolls. Snake Fu. Rat Fu. Guinea Fu. DriveIn Academy Award nominations for Jill 
King, as Evelyn's little girl, for lookin at a 
picture of her dead father and sayin Daddy, I 
think Momma's gettin SICK again;Bill
Thurman, as the Reverend Bill McWilley, 
for sayin We got everything we need right 
here --Old Crow, and Vi-eena sausage; Major Brock, as Melvin Crenshaw the 
repairman, for sayin They oughta call this a 
roach motel and for nailin Evelyn under the 
floor; Will Mitchel, as A1 the traveling 
salesman, for pickin up two girls and sayin 
You girls ever heard of Columbia Records? 
Thats mine -- that's my baby  Barbara 
Mandrell, she's made me a million cause I 
cann never think of stuff that good to say; 
Greg Brazzel, as the dimwit newlywed, who 
gets gangrene of the brain; and James 
Bradford, as the Sheriff, for saying Six dead 
bodies in there? Sorry I was so late in 
getting here.

Forbes Gallery presents Alumni Show this week
The 1986 annual Alumni Show, featuring 
works by Pat Bellan-Gillen, Ron Desmett, 
Lynne Marcovsky, Gerald Pagane, Peter 
Wargo, and Paul Zelevansky is currently on 
exhibit at Forbes Gallery. This year's show 
focuses on work by alumni graduated be
tween 1967 and 1980, and was chosen by 
Laura Gillen, the Gallery Director, from 
slides submitted by the artists. This small 
exhibit is ideal for Forbes' small space, as it 
allows the viewer to consider the individual 
personality of the artists' diverse imagery.Pat Bellan-Gillen, a '79 grad, and currently 
a drawing instructor at CMU, presents a 
large colored drawing instructor at CMU, 
presents a large colored drawing of a burning deer effigy, richly layered with vivid marks 
and colors. Two works are featured by Ron 
Desmett, class of '79. The first, Someone's 
Got It In For Me, a multimedia wall 
sculpture, juxtaposes traditional American 
iconography with dramatic color and texture. 
Ron also exhibits his Cross Vessel, a cer
amic work completed at CMU. Lynne Mar
covsky, a 1971 alumnus, shows two paint
ings, Under The Full Moon, and Two
Headed Animal. Both are surreal and at the 
same time funky, with their playful imagery 
and color.
The class of 1975's Gerald Pagane exhibits 
two refreshingly humorous wood-cut prints, 
Man With Motor and Inside and Outside 
Restaurant, thankfully lacking the angst too 
often present in this medium. Peter Wargo, a 
1980 grad, exhibits the most interesting work of the show with his multi-media 
constructions, Flat Top and Blue Scarp. 
Flat Top, completed as a senior at CMU,
As Entertainment Editor I would like to 
take this opportunity to introduce you to the 
new and improved Diversions. Among the 
many new instalments is the addition of a 
Drive-In Movie Critic,Joe Bob Briggs. And 
as you can see he is not just another movie 
critic. We chose him over the more serious columnists because we feel that he appeals 
more towards the college audience. However,
collages paint, handmade paper, and even 
rubber stamp prints, for a beautifully layered 
compostition. Blue Scarp, constructed with 
ceramic elements and cardboard, is even more 
striking with its beautiful color and variety 
of textures. Paul Zelevansky, class of '61, is 
represented by several art books, including 
Sweep, and intriguing translation of words 
into visual language.
Overall, the 1986 Alumni Show is a 
successful insight into artistic life after CMU. The exhibit will continue until Sep
tember 14.
this point remains to be seen here at 
Carnegie Mellon. The point of this paper is 
to serve the University community and in 
order to do this properly, we need your help. 
So, look over the entire section and send us

The Pittsburgh Symphony Season at a glance...
By Bruce Kasrel
Tartan Entertainment Editor
When Lorin Maazel began Beethoven's Eighth Symphony this past weekend, a new 
Pittsburgh Symphony Season was ushered in. This years Triple Anniversary Season 
promises to be one of the finest in recent years. Featuring a host of superb conductors, 
soloists, and masterpieces almost every 
concert will offer something special.
The twenty-four different programs (72 
performances in all) are scheduled on 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings as well as a Sunday matinee in Heinz Hall. 
Here is a listing of the season for the fall 
semester, with notes on what to listen .for 
(those dates marked with an asterix are 
available through the housing office):
Sept. 11,12,14
Morton Gould,Classical Variations on 
Colonial Themes(world premiere) 
Hindemith ^Mathis der Maler 
Brahms,Piano Concerto No. 2 
Lorin Maazel,conductor 
Horacio Gutierrez,piano 
This concert features a brand new work in 
honor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's 200th 
anniversary. Gould who has been likened to Gershwin in one of Americas greatest living 
composer. He is most famous for writing 
the music for the ABC mini-series "The 
Holocaust" and a Concerto for Tap-Dancer 
and Orchestra. Gutierrez is a popular guest 
on The Tonight Show and is considered one 
of todays finest pianists.
Sept. 19,20,21*
Shostakovich,Violin Concerto
Tchaikovsky,Symphony No. 6 PathetiqueLorin Maazel,conductor 
Viktoria Mullova,violin 
In an all-Russian program like this, one 
expects lush melodies and romantic 
overtones. Although, the Tchiakovsky has 
both, the Shostakovich has neither. The 
violin concerto features brisk passages 
throughout much of the work. Mullova's 
energetic playing, Russian heritage and 1980 
Tchaikovsky Music Competition Gold 
Medal make her an excellent choice. The 
Sixth is considered one of the all-time great 
pieces and Maazel should be a fine advocate.
Sept. 25,26,27 
Mozart,Symphony No. 39 
Mahler^Scwgs of a Wayfarer 
Tchaikovsky franee sea da Rimini 
Zdenek Macal,conductor 
Mimi Lerner,mezzo-soprano 
The Mozart 39 is one of his more 
noteworthy symphonies. Comming from his 
later period the piece is bright and melodic. 
Lerner is Carnegie Mellon graduate who 
frequently appears with the PSO. She is 
always well-received and the Songs should 
provide an excellent forum for her talent. 
Francesca is one of only a handfull of works 
by the composer which does not sound like 
Tchaikovsky should sound like. The works 
shifts abruptly with no apparent theme 
connecting the various parts. Romantics at 
heart might be surprised, but it is an 
exciting and interesting work.
Oct. 2,4,5*Beethoven,Overture of Egmont 
Mozart,Piano Concerto No. 25 
Prokofiev,Symphony No. 1 Classical 
Respighi,Pines of Rome 
Zdenek Macal,conductor 
Alicia De Larrocha,piano 
Egmont was the opening to the incidental 
music for Goethe's drama in 1810. Although 
the rest of the work remains in virtual obscurity, the overture remains standard 
repertoire. De Larrocha's years of experience 
and emotional playing should give the 
Mozart a special performance. The Prokofiev 
is an excellent choice as an "overture" for the 
Pines. It's neo-classical style will
complement Respighi work which will 
feature the horn section playing from the 
balcony - always a crowd pleaser.
Oct. 17,18,19*Berio,Two Piano Concerto 
Bartk ^Miraculous Madarin Suite 
Kodaly,Dances of Galanta 
Kodaly Jlary Janos Suite 
Adam Fischer,conductor 
Katia and Marielle Labeque,pianos 
The Berio is one of the most unusal pieces
Viktoria Mullova will perform the 
Shostakovich Violin Concerto
of music ever scored for piano. Starting and 
ending with four minutes of freeform from 
the two pianos, every live performance of 
the piece is never the same. The exciting 
Labeques are perhaps the best choice to 
perform this often confusing yet beautiful 
work. The Bartok has many similarities to 
the Berio although it has more apparent 
melodies. Both Bartok and Kodaly are 
considered two of Hungary's most prolific 
composers, so one expects many folk-dance 
melodies. Galanta is just that. Gypsy
rhythms run throughout the work. Janos is a 
musical "bed-time story" about the veteran 
soldier, Harry Janos, who boasts victory 
over Napoleon. Fischer, who hails from 
Budapest, should be a fine interpreter of his countrymen.
Oct. 30,31,Nov 2 
BaXyThe Garden of Fand 
Shotakovich,Cello Concerto No. 1 
Brahms,Symphony No. 4 
Andrew Davis,conductor
Carnegie Mellon grad Mimi Lerner 
will sing the words of Mahler
Lynn Harrel,cello
Bax, a lesser known yet influential English 
impressionist composer, was fascinated with 
neighboring Ireland. Subsequently, Fand is 
based on an Irish legend. If you like subtle 
mood music such as Debussy this is for 
you. The Shotakovich is surely one of 
cellists favorite pieces since it sports a sixminute cadenza. The Brahms 4 is the most 
monumental and somber of his four 
symphonies. The work features a standard 
first movement and a marvelously beautiful
second. The third movement is hailed as the 
finest scherzo since Beethoven and the final 
movement is 33 variations on the Bach 
Church Contata #150. Unorthodox in it's 
structure, the Brahms should give the British conductor a welcome challenge.
Nov 14,15
Arvo Paert,Symphony No. 2 (U.S. 
premiere)
Tchaikovsky,Violin Concerto 
Glazunov,Symphony No. 4 
Neemi Jarvi,conductor 
Nathan Milstein,violin 
A native of the Russian-ruled Estonia, Paert is famous for his ability to create a 
variety of sounds using the entire orchestral 
spectrum. The conductor, also a native Estonian, choose this work because "it takes a Tchaikovsky tune and embeds it in a 
collage of Paert's own composition." This should provide an interesting opening act for 
the Violin Concerto following it. Milstein, 
a master of the instrument, has only made a 
handful of appearances here in Pittsburgh 
since Steinberg retired. They allegedly had a 
fierce disagreement years back and Milstein never performed with Steinberg again. The 
Glazunov is written in cyclic form and has a 
strong Russian atmosphere.
Nov. 20,21
Berlioz^ damnation de Faust 
Charles Dutoit,conductor
Medelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh 
and soloists
Titled a symphonic drama, the French 
composer scored the work for four voices, 
chorus, and orchestra. The piece is one of the 
most diverse and and inspired from the French master. Also a Frenchman, Dutoit is 
always well received here in Pittsburgh 
especially when he conducts works from his 
homeland. The deep, French romanticism of 
the work will certainly showcase the talents 
of this acclaimed conductor. This is the only 
single-work program of the year and it will 
be performed without intermission, so come 
early.
Nov. 28,29,30*
Mozart,Symphony No. 31 Paris 
Liszt,Piano Concerto No. 1 
Stravinsky,The Firebird 
Charles Dutoit,conductor 
Hai-Kyung Suh,piano 
Because of his father, who informed Mozart 
that to be successful in Paris meant 
imminent world-wide fame, Mozart worked 
on his Symphony No. 31 with enthusiasm. 
The result is a delightful work with many 
interesting features (a loud clash in the 
beginning of the final movement was 
inserted to surprise the audience). The Liszt 
Concerto is also as intriguing. It boasts a 
unusually large triangle part and an brilliant 
piano line. The Firebird is one of the most 
famous works ever written and here it will 
performed in it's complete ballet form. 
Dutoit is an extremely energetic and 
animated conductor, so this performance 
might proves as pleasing to the eyes as to 
the ears.
Dec. 11, 12,13 
Liszt filazzepa
Saint-Saens,Piano Concerto No. 5
Baitok,Music for Strings, Precussion, 
and Celesta 
Ivan Fischer,conductor 
Lorin Hollander,piano.
Franz Liszt wrote many works of program 
music which Mazzepa is one. Based on a 
poem, the work is light in texture. SaintSans, like Liszt, was famous for his 
virtuoso talents on the keyboard and their 
concertos among the best. The 5th is rarely 
performed, but it is considered standard 
repertoire. Bartok's work was originally just 
an experiment that eventually turned into a 
classic representation of 20th Century 
Music. Many may recognize the second 
section as the chase music in The Shining.

Another fun summer of action, horror, and suspense ...
Mathew Broderick sings Twist and Shout in Ferris Beullers Day Off
By JOE FERRUGIA
Tartan Theatre Critic
Once the weather gets warm most 
people start thinking about baseball, beaches 
and bikinis. But to movie studio executives, 
summer means only one thing: box office 
bucks. Let's face it, the summer is when mo
vie theaters are going to do their best busi
ness; kids are out of school, adults are on 
vacation and everybody seems to have more 
free time than any other time of the year. 
Since summer television is only good for 
those who missed a few Cosby or Ties ep
isodes, movies are the obvious chioce for 
our entertainment dollars.
The Summer of '85, you will recall, 
was the year we went Back to the Future. 
This year we don't have any time travel, but 
that didn't stop Hollywood from dishing out 
the adventure. This summer's biggest box 
office hit was Top Gun, the name of the 
training school for the Navy's best fighter 
pilots. The film grossed over $125 million 
and is still doing well in some markets (it's 
currently playing at the Kings Court). Tom 
Cruise emerged as the hero most boys 
wanted to be like and most girls just wanted. 
The Karate Kid II, the Rocky-like story star
ing Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita was the 
second biggest at $94 million. Although not 
as visually exciting as Gun, it was an 
adventure of different sorts in modem day Ja
pan.
If adventure films were Hollywoods 
bread and butter, then comedies were it's just 
deserts. This summer was a host to no less 
than 10 comedies with two shining well 
above the rest: Rodney Dangerfield's Back to 
School and Ferris Bueller's Day Off starring 
Matthew Broderick. Dangerfield played a selfmade millionare who enrolled in college to 
prove something, while Broderick played a 
school kid desperately trying to take the day 
off. Fortunately, the comedy was not 
restricted to the classroom. Ruthless People 
gave us Danny DeVito as a scheming creep 
trying to bump off his wife, played by Bette 
Midler. While the short lived Club Paradise 
had Robin Williams as the unlikey hero of a 
Carribbean island.
Comedy teams were also fairly 
successful. A Fine Mess brought Ted 
(Cheers) Danson and Howie (St. Elsewhere) 
Mandel together while Running Scared did 
somewhat better with Billy Crystal and 
Gregory Hines.
Although straight comedies are usually 
the front-runners every summer, Hollywood 
broke the mold with About Last Night, 
Nothing In Common and Heartburn. All 
three dealt with real life situtations in a 
realistic manner while keeping a humorours 
edge. Tom Hanks put in a brilliant perfor
mance as a childish ad executive faced with 
the divorce of his parents, and Streep was eq
ually good in her role as a wife faced with 
the decision if divorce. Demi Moore and Rob 
Lowe had a rollercoaster relationship, but 
this film was the only of the three to contain 
a storybook ending with sunset et al.
Of course the Summer of '86 was not 
without horror movies. In fact, they ranged 
from the trashy slasher to the brilliant and 
poignant. Of course, no summer would be 
complete without the ever present Friday 
the 13th. The real scare came when 
Hollywood revealed that it would make the 
movies every year until Part 13-how poetic. 
Now that IS scary! Fortunately for us horror 
fans, there were two releases that thrilled us 
enough to keep us up nights until October. 
The first was the long awaited Aliens which 
starred Sigourney Weaver and scores of those 
lovable critters from Alien. John Cameron 
(The Terminator) created a suspense-packed 
thriller that was even better than the first. 
The other skin-crawler was The Fly, the 
remake of the Hollywood classic which 
starred Vincent Price.This version starred Jeff 
Goldblum and Gena Davis and proved that a 
horror film can still exhibit human emotions 
and still work. In the film, Goldblum slowly
undergoes a metamorphosis which 
transforms him into (you guessed it) a fly. 
The effects are sometimes harsh yet the film 
is more than just a special effects show. Th
ere is a loving relationship between Gold
blum and Davis that exists even after 
Goldblum has started to become quite 
hideous. This relationship is definitely part 
of the movies appeal.
If Hollywood proved one thing this 
summer it was that even "biggies" can make 
bad movies. Stephen King finally decided to 
"do it himself and directed his own movie, 
Maximum Overdrive. This time he has no 
one to blame for his failure but himself. 
Gene Wilder also subscribed to the do-ityourself' philosophy and created a horrible 
mess called Haunted Honeymoon. Even 
Wilder's hilarious costar/wife, Gilda Radner, 
and Dom DeLuise.in drag couldn't save this 
film. Sylvestor Stallone proved that even 
Rambo can have a bad day. His film Cobra 
was unimpressive and quickly forgotten. 
But the all time big loser this summer had 
to be George (Star Wars) Lucas. Lucas' 
effort with Jim Henson and David Bowie, 
Labyrinth, proved to be a monumental dis
appointment considering its collaborators. 
Lucas'other flop was the aweful Howard the 
Duck which has made back only one third of 
what it cost Lucas to make.
Dramas didn't appear very much during 
the summer (they usually don't) but there 
was one notable exception. Extremeties, star
ring Farrah Fawcett is an absorbing study of 
social values and is powerful drama. Fawcett 
stars as a woman who is almost raped, tw
ice. The second time, she manages to subdue 
her attacker and tie him up in the fireplace. 
She must then decide whether to take matters 
into her own hands or to call the police and 
face the likely prospect that the rapist will 
go free. Even the most liberal minded will 
find themselves re-evaluating their beliefs.
I'd have a hard time awarding the title of
Most Memorable Film of the Summer of 
'86. The major nominees would have to in
clude Top Gun, Aliens, Back to School, 
Ruthless People and The Fly. Top Gun 
definitely gets the Sheer Energy Award for 
its exhilirating flight sequences while Aliens 
gets the On The Edge of Your Seat Award 
for having more suspense than any other 
summer movie. Back to School gets the 
Funniest Dangerfield Movie Award while 
Ruthless People gets the DeVito/Midler/Reinhold Award for having the best 
combination of zanies in a single film. The 
Fly gets the How Could She Hug That Th
ing? Award for the most memorable audience 
reaction to a scene in a summer movie.
Finally, Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason 
Lives, gets the Would They Please Re
consider Award in hopes that the studio will 
read this article and NOT do 7 more Jason 
movies.

A Difference in Styles
By John Friedmann
You don't need to be told the differences 
between Carnegie Mellon and Pitt. As much 
as Carnegie Mellon has the advantage 
academically, Pitt has the advantage 
athletically. Despite the relative impotence 
the Panthers displayed on Labor Day, it 
would take some serious drugs to even 
imagine anything less than total destruction 
if the Panthers and Tartans did battle on the 
gridiron.
But Divison III athletics, where CMU 
competes, have a dignity all their own.It is competition for its own sake. The 
players play for themselves, their friends, 
and families. The athletes are not competing 
for room, board, and tuition, or a shot at the 
Olympics or professional sports.
For most events, anything even remotely 
resembling a student ID gets the bearer in for 
free. If there is an admission charge, its 
usually pretty nominal. If you want to go to 
the game, you go to the game. Someone 
trying to scalp tickets would just be laughed 
at.
And the athletes themselves. Carnegie 
Mellon doesn't have an equivalent of Pitt's 
"Ironhead" Heyward, who beats up paperboys 
and attacks students with his crutches. Most 
Tartan athletes have a little pride in the fact 
that they are carrying a demanding course 
load, and yet can compete and win on the 
field or in the gym.The Division III athlete must also make do 
with lesser resurces than his big-college 
counterpart.
For example, Pitt's typical travel schedule 
reads like this "Depart from Pittsburgh
International Friday on USAir Charter. 
Arrive Syracuse. Housing Friday night at the Hotel Syracuse. Return immediately after the 
game Saturday on USAir Charter."
A typical Tartan football travel schedule "Depart Saturday morning from the rear of 
Donner Hall by bus. Arrive Grove City. 
Postgame meal at Grove City College 
cafeteria. Return home immediately 
following by bus." Get the picture? If, by 
chance the team flies somewhere, such as 
Salisbury during the NCAA playoffs, they 
go when USAir is good and ready, and not 
before.
The football program itself is more low 
key. The locker room would fit inside Pitt's 
twice, with room to spare. Alumni pressure on the football caoch is mostly nonexistent. 
There are no hordes of media waiting 
anxiously to second guess the first move of 
head coach Lackner.
When was the last time you heard of a 
recruiting scandal in Division III football? 
The are no cash payoffs, or blondes in red 
convertibles used to entice gridiron standouts 
to enroll at Carnegie Mellon. In fact, most 
of the cash flows the other way during the 
student/athlete's tenure here. And there are 
no special classes or majors, populated soley 
by athletes. No basketweaving majors at 
Tech. Maybe down the street...
Perhaps Carnegie Mellon's athletic 
program is not as pure as I have made them 
out to be. Perhaps the NCAA is breathing 
down Athletic Director Jim Banner's neck. 
As your read this, investigators may be 
winging their way to Pittsburgh from 
NCAA headquarters in Lawrence, Kansas. If 
so, enjoy it while it lasts.

A Big Change at the Top
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Sports Editor
For the first time in ten years, the football 
Tartans have a new head coach. Chuck 
Klausing, long a symbol of the program as a 
head coach, resigned last February in favor of 
longtime understudy Rick Lackner.
Aging patriarch Chuck Klausing, pursuing 
what may be his last chance at being top dog 
at a Division I program, accepted an 
assistant's position under first-year Pitt 
leader Mike Gottfried. Klausing's legacy 
includes six conference titles and four NCAA 
playoff berths, and a an overall record of 77- 
15-2. Even more valuable was Klausing's 
extensive recruiting network, helping CMU 
attract the best area athletes who could meet 
the academic standards.
Lackner has served the Carnegie Mellon 
football program in several capacities since 
1974. A four year letterman at linebacker, he 
was a three time All-PAC selection, and was 
accorded Academic All-American mention in 
his sophomore and senior seasons. After 
graduation, he served succesively as assistant 
linebacker coach, offensive line coach, and 
offensive coordinator before being named to 
the head spot. Lackner, who turned 30 at the 
end of July, is the seventh youngest 
football coach out of 505 teams playing 
under the NCAA banner.
Interestingly, Klausing's plans for Lackner 
might have to have been put on hold, at 
least for a few years. Dorn Poluszek, 
defensive coordinator under Kalusing since 
1980 had left several months prior to take 
the same job at Marshall University. 
Perhaps Poluszek would have been the 
choice to succeed Klausing, given his 
reputation and local recruiting contacts.
But Lackner was Athletic Director Jim 
Banner's first choice for the position, and 
Banner had little difficulty getting his man. 
"I'm pleased to name Rich to head our 
football program," noted the Tartan A.D. 
"He's a young, aggressive and talented coach 
who's respected by players, staff and the 
university community."
Despite the comparrisons to Klausing, 
Lackner is the head coach, and has 
differentiated himself from Klausing even 
before his players reported to camp. Each 
player left campus with an intensive 
conditioning schedule, a program that some 
players followed closely, and most paid at 
least lip service to. This rfewly-developed 
package contrasts sharply with Klausing's 
well-worn (and more relaxed) workout 
assignments.
He is also a more active coach than Chuck 
Klausing was at Carnegie Mellon. Instead of 
sitting on the hillside barking out commands 
and advice, Lackner gets down in the 
trenches with his troops. If Lackner sees one 
of his players doing something incorrectly, 
he'll show the offender how to do it right.
Lackner's gridiron tactics are also different. 
He favors the pass more than Klausing did, 
and has plans to utilize well the arm of 
senior quarterback Mike Hensel. But he still 
plans to stay with a balanced offense, taking 
advantage of Carnegie Mellon's corps of 
experienced runners.
While he has fine tuned with the offense, 
CMU's new head coach has overhauled the 
defense. Gone is the "50" defense favored in 
past years, instead replaced by the "4-3" 
formation, which Lackner feels will better 
utilize the skills of the Tartan corps of 
defenders.

Many New Faces at Assistants' Spots
rash
addi
By JOHN FRIEDMANN
Tartan Sports Editor
When head coaches change, the first people 
affected are the assistants. Some move up to 
better positions with the team. Others leave, 
or are fired. New ones are hired.
This observation certainly held true when 
Rick Lackner replaced Chuck Klausing as 
CMU head football coach last Spring. 
Although no one was fired, only three of the 
eight assistant coaching spots are fifled by 
the same person who held the position last 
season.
Defensive coordinator Don Poluszek was 
the firsLjo depart. However, hifr-December 
departurepreceded Klausing's announcement 
tyro months. In this context, his 
^e considered unrelated to the ;s that follow^f later. In 
h|s value as ao-: experienced 
coordinator, Poluszek played a 
i' recruiting efforts. 
PoluLszSt*^ replacement is^ Terry 
who coadjedthe defensive e!$dfc-,&st year. 
This is Bodnar's third job in dfterfiin of 
coaching Carnegie Mellon football. He, first 
served -0% graduate assistant while teaching 
at Deer jskes High School, and then moved 
up to defensive end coach. Bodii made his 
name as a linebacker for Deer Lakes High 
School and Marietta College, before 
switching to center for his senior year at 
Marrieta. His primary responsibility is the 
defensive secondary.
Rich Erdelyi, who formerly oversaw the 
offensive line, becomes the third CMU 
offensive coordinator in four years. The 
position opened up when Rich Lackner, who 
served only two seasons in the spot, became 
the Tartan top dog. Prior to Lackner, 
quarterback coach Gerry Mancini held the 
offensive coordinator title for eight years, 
but the designation was switched due to 
Lackner's full-time status.
Erdlyi came to the Tartans from the 
Pittsburgh Maulers, where he served as an 
administrative assistant He is the only
member of the staff with "major league" 
coaching experience.
Before the Maulers, Erdelyi was just down 
the street from Carnegie Mellon, at Central 
Catholic. During his six year tenure as head 
coach at Central,.one of his standout players 
was future Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan 
Marino.
Gerry Mancini is one of the Tartans' 
coaching fixtures. His eleven years coaching 
the Carnegie Mellon ^offense surpasses the 
tenure of any other current CMU coach.
Coach Mancini has worn two hats as a 
coach here, but his duties have remained 
unchanged. For his first eight years, he bore 
the title of offensive coordinator, and for his 
last three he has been more precisely 
identified _ as the offesnive 
backfield/quarterback coach. But all during 
that period. .Mancini was responsible for the 
sparkplugs that started the Tartan offensive 
engine.During Mancini's tenure, a remarkable 
number of fine quarterbacks and running 
backs have propelled Carnegie Mellon's 
attack. Last fesu was no exception. The 
Tartans averaged 271 yards per game rushing 
and 176 in the air. Those figures were good 
enough for the team offense leadership in the 
PAC, a croWh the Tartans have captured 
several times' during the 11 years under 
Mancini.Defensive line coach Tom Nee also holds 
the same position as last year, but changed 
jobs the year before. For six years, he 
presided over the offensive line, before 
switching to defense before last season.
Under Nee's guidance, the Tartan defensive 
line limited opponent's offenses to an 
average of 264 yards per game, second in the 
PAC behind Washington and Jefferson 
College. Nee, however, did not have the 
advantage of W&J's PAC Defensive Player 
of the Year, 280 pound defensive tackle 
Orlando Williams.
Nee, like Mancini, enjoyed considerable 
success with the offense during his tenure.

During his last season as offensive line 
coach, his lineman helped clear the way for 
almost 350 yards pea game, 
in the PAC.
The new offensive line 
Koren, who the Tartans plucfced from 
Central Catholic, where he held the same 
position. This was his second tenure at 
Central, the first serving under, th^ head 
coach and now offensive coordinator Erdelyi. 
In between, he ran the offensive line at 
Duquesne, serving under current head coach 
Dan McCann
His association with Central Catholic 
extends back further than his coaching. 
Koren lettered twice as a center there in the mid 1970's. After graduating from Central 
Catholic, he played ton the offensive line at 
Juniata college, before taking up coaching.
A1 Fletcher takes over the instruction of 
the outside linebackers this year. He is the 
taking the postion formerly held by Larry 
"Duke" Strager, who left to instruct 
linebackers at Murray State University ( a 
former coaching stop of Pitt Head Coach 
Mike Gottfried.)
Fletcher has head coaching experience at 
two local high schools. Bishop McCort and 
Deer Lakes, where he teaches math and 
computer science. He was head coach at Deer
Lakes unti# 1978, when he left to. become 
defensive coordinator for the minor-league 
Pittsburgh Wortfpack. He was. promoted to* 
head coa^h.inl980, and won the conference 
championship for the second straight year, v 
Entering, hi$, secon^ year coaching the 
Tartans' receivers is Mark Lcposky. Leposkyr, 
is an appropriate choice to fufill that role; 
since he was an outstanding receiver for - 
Carnegie l^etfoi^ in the early 1980s. In 
1982, his he snagged 28 passes
and racked up 504 yards. In one contest versus eventual conference champion Hiram. 
Leposky managed 199 yards on 11 
receptions, y
Defensive end coach Bemie Colbert spent 
1982 and 1983 out of football. He served as 
head coach at Kiski High School from 1979 
to 1981, but then spent two years away from 
coaching. But he returned, accepting an 
assistant's position with North Catholic 
High School, which he held until joining 
Rick Lackner's staff. He had served two 
previous stints at North Catholic, one as an 
assistant before going on to Kiski, and 
another as a student and offensive lineman.
Colbert spend his college years at North 
Carolina State, and received training from a 
big name in coaching. Lou Holtz, for three 
years as a student assistant.

Head CoachThe Tartan
This is the transcript of an interview 
conducted with new Tartan football head 
coach Rich Lackner, conducted on August 
28.
TARTAN: First, how do you like the job?
LACKNER: The job is great. I'm working 
with good people..We had a good camp, its 
been well organized. I enjoy it.
TARTAN: Is what you expected?
LACKNER: Yeah, I guess so. I worked so 
close with Chuck [Klausing], I knew what 
he did on a daily basis. I was here to assist 
him in any way. It's a little different. One 
day you're taking orders, the next day youre 
divvying up responsibility and it's you're job 
to use your noodle a little differently or to 
innovate some things.
TARTAN: The biggest thing on our minds 
right now, and probbably yours too, is Mike 
Hensel and his baseball injury. How is he 
now, and when to you expect him to be 
ready to go 100 %?
LACKNER: Mike, since the day he got 
injured, has worked extermely hard in 
rehabilitating the knee. He has not missed a 
practice. Mentally, he could step in and run 
the show as our quarterback... Theres a 
chance he could be ready for the Allegheney 
game. Whether or not we're going to use 
him at that time and chance reinjuring the 
knee, I can't say. We'll just play it a day at a 
time. He's a big concern.
TARTAN: You've been here all four years 
Mike's been here. How have you felt about 
Mike playing baseball in the spring?
LACKNER: We encourage our kids to do 
anything that's going to better him as a 
football player, and I'd rather see Mike 
Hensel out there playing baseball than 
sitting in his room drinking Pepsi and eating 
Doritos. We like to see our kids involve 
themselvs in all aspects of campus life. That 
includes IM's, that includes clubs, that 
includes other sports, and we encourage our 
kids to run track or play baseball, or 
whatever. It seems every year one individual 
does get a very serious injury over the 
summer....This year it happened to be 
Michael. Thank God, knock on wood, he 
didnt do it that badly and hell be able to 
come back. I think hell come back and I 
think hell play a lot of football this year.
TATAN: Okay, well...
LACKNER: They aren't on scholarship here.
I mean, I can't tell a kid you cant do this or 
can't do that. I would discourage a kid from 
doing something that close to football 
season. As the summer starts to wear on, I 
would think you would start to tone down 
your other activities and just concentrate on 
being in shape.
TARTAN: Did you ever consider asking 
Mike to redshirt?
LACKNER: School is so expensive. If 
Mike gan graduate this May, naturally 
financially it's going to be better for him and 
we would encourage him to do that. Now if 
for some reason he doesn't finish on time,
and he did change his major....and if he has
another year, we'll have to look into his 
eligibility for next year. I dont think he has 
eligibility for next year, but that is to be 
determined after the season.
TARTAN: I'm sure youd like him back...
LACKNER: Oh, yeah! Theres a coach in 
the NCAA who played a kid for 7 or 8 years 
one lime. The NCAA asked him why, and 
he said he just liked the kid. I like Mike. I'd 
'love to have Mike for the next 4 or 5
Questions
years. .One thing about football and the 
NCAA, you have a player for 4 or 5 years 
and then that's it, theyre gone.
TARTAN: Obviously, Mike has matured as 
a player. Are you going to restructure your 
offense around Mike Hensel?
LACKNER: I think we basically knew what 
we had last year with Mike and we molded 
our offense around not only Mike but the 
abilities of the kids surrounding Mike. We 
felt this year our material was very similar 
to what we had last year, regarding our 
skilled positions...our running backs, our 
quarterback. The offense still fits those 
individuals rather well. Don't look for major 
changes in our offense, look for some 
different wrinkles...
TARTAN: Would you like to throw the 
football more?
LACKNER: I think [offesnsive coordinator] 
Coach Erdelyi, myself, Coach Klausing, our 
philosophy has always been: We'll do 
whatever it takes to win the football game. 
If it take takes throwing the ball 42 times 
for 368 yards against [NCAA playoff 
opponent] Salisbury State, if that's what it 
takes to win the football game, well do it. If 
what it takes to win the football game is 
running the ball 62 times, then we'll do that. 
But the good thing about our offesne is that 
I think well have the ability to do both. If 
you can do both, you are not labelled as a 
"running team" or a' passing team," you now 
keep the defense off balance...and that 
enhances your chances of winning the 
football game.
TARTAN: What about your receivers. You 
lost a good one [now graduated] David 
Richards...
LACKNER: We're trying to replace David, 
and David is a tough one to replace. David 
has a great deal of athletic ability and caught 
the ball very well. We have 6 or 7 young 
men in camp vying for that position, and I 
cant say one has jumped out .and taken us 
by storm. We're impressed by Joe 
Mancuso...Joes done a good job. Roy 
Teresky's been here for three years and runs a 
very diciplined route and catches the ball 
very well, but he's got a groin injury. We 
have a very fast freshman in camp who's 
maturing named "Lovelace. We have kid from 
Trafford, a freshman named Beresford, and he 
has just done a super job in camp...and 
performed beyond our expectations..If I
pulled [receivers coach] Mark Leposky in and 
said "Who's one and two?," he'd have a 
tough time. I think he's starting to get a feel 
of whose going to do the job, but I think 
well have to get these kids on film and see 
who does come through.
TARTAN: So its possible a freshman could 
see significant playing time?
LACKER: Theres a possibility the
Beresford kid could come in and 
play...Theres a chance. Im not saying hes 
going to. Theres a chance those other kids 
are going to come through. There's a chance 
Roy Teresky's going to inherit thay job. But 
it's going to be a question of who performs, 
and we're going to find the best one ... and 
play him.
TARTAN: The running back situation looks 
a little bit more stable. You have three
veterans coming back in Tony Collaros, 
Mike Minjock and Tim Denmeade...barring 
any injuries you should have them together. 
Will there be any room for anybody else?
LACKNER: Oh yes. Chris Hansen has had a 
very good camp. He has a lot of ability, he 
is a very physical fullback, does a great job 
of blocking, and seems to catch the ball 
well. He's probbabally going to see some 
time. Whether he can beat out Tony is 
another question. Tony has had a very good 
camp, and seems to be running the ball well. 
Bobby Patterson, another halfback..has put 
on good weight since last year. Bobby has 
fine moves. He's an elusive runner, 
somewhat in the mold of a Mike Minjock 
type of kid.... Gary Marchionna should see 
playing time too. Don't be suprised if some 
of these kids see some playing time who are 
at running back. Billy Heiser has had a 
fantastic camp. Billy Heiser adds a lot of 
dimesnsions to our offense. He can play 
split end, he can play left half, he can play 
right half...he catches the ball very well and 
will help us a great deal with our run and 
shoot plan.Billy is a kind of utility player 
that is very dependable. He can do any 
number of things, and with that ability, he 
makes himself very marketable in the 
coaches' minds.
TARTAN: You moved Billy Cramer to 
Defensive back. Why that move?
LACKNER: Its good thing we did. We lost 
threee defensive backs last year to 
graduation. Billy Cramer this year
offensively, at best was going to split time. 
Defensively, he would have a chance to play 
on a full time basis. ...Billy has fufilled all 
of our expectations defensively. Frank 
Meehan went down with appendicitis last 
night, and was operated on today. I think the 
chances of him coming back are slim, and he 
and Billy were at the same positiion, 
fighting for that comer job, so I think that 
Billy's going to be up to the challenge.
TARTAN: You've made big changes in the 
defnese, with the 4-3 built around Ron Orie?
LACKNER: Right.
TARTAN: Was Ron the reason for the 
switch?
LACKNER: No. The reawson we switched, 
quite frankly, we find it very difficult in 
recruiting good sized defensive linemen. It 
seems like any kid whos 6-2 or bigger gets a 
scholarship offer somewhere. We get a great 
deal of the Chris Haupt, Rick LaValle, Jerry 
Bosch, Alex Hoffman., the 5'11" to 62", 
185 to 215 pound size kid. As a result we 
felt the 4-3 better fit our personnel. In the 4- 
3 we only need to have 2 defensive tackles, 
as opposed to the 50, where you have a nose 
tackle and 2 tackles. I think it was a switch 
made for personnel reasons, not necessarily 
for Ron. Although I think Ron and Danny 
Lankitus are doing a good job at the middle 
linebacker spot, and they are going to get 
better, too.
TARTAN: What are the weaknesses of the 4- 
3, as you see it?
LACKNER: The inherent weakness of the 4- 
3, and with any defense, is that there is a 
soft spot. That's a spot where there is 
nobody on the line of scrimage. And people 
tend to try to hit those spots. In the 4-3, the 
soft spot is over the center and the two 
tackles, who are not covered. ...we have 
ways of plugging thse seams, if people are 
hurting us. The strength of the 4-3 is just 
that it fits our material a little better. It 
enables us to do some things secondary-wise 
that we've wanted to do but we haven't been 
able to to with the 50.. Defensively, our 
strengths are Ken Harris...Tom Frost, Ron 
Orie, Mike LaValle. But secondary-wise 
we're awful inexperienced. We don't have 
time to mature. We've got to mature in 
camp, because we're going to get tested 
against Allegheney.
TARTAN: The players seem very enthused 
about the 4-3, and think it will help your 
coverage especially against the pass...
LACKNER: We'll be a little more agressive 
defensively against the pass.
TARTAN:But have you noticed the same 
reaction from the players to the 4-3?
LACKNER:I think our coaches have done a 
good job in camp of selling the 4-3 to the 
kids. One of the big things is that the kids 
have to believe in the coaches and they have 
to believe in the scheme. We tried to explain 
to them why we implemented it, how we 
implemented it is a little unique as compared 
to a lot of teams that run the 4-3, and how it 
can help us against the various teams we're 
going to face in our league.'
TARTAN: You talked about very little 
experience in your secondary. Lets talk about 
where you have not too much experience at 
all, your kicking game.
LACKNER: Well I wont mention names, 
but we don't have a kicker we had the past 
two years. But I will say that Jimmy Kelly, 
who plays strong safety for us has done a 
very good job. Hes got a very strong leg, an

Rich Lackner
accurate leg, I've noticed one thing, that 
when the starting kicker graduates or decides 
not to play, you get kickers coming out of 
the woodwork. Everyone's coming up to me 
today 'I want to kick, I want to kick,' and 
that's fine. I'm glad the campus is interested 
enough that these kids are coming out...It's 
nice to see that. Punting wise, we lost [Joe] 
Mollica from last year, who was our punter, 
and we lost our backup punter to academics 
from last year's team. We are right now 
looking at Bart Patterson and Laslow Budda 
as our punting prospects. They're a little 
inconsistent right now, but with two more 
weeks of practice before our first game I 
think they'll come along just fine.
TARTAN: Billy Kramer did a fine job for 
you returning kicks last year. I imagine he 
will be doing that again. Who's going to 
join him?
LACKNER: I see two people returning 
punts right now...Billy Cramer and Mike 
LaValle. The both have good quickness, 
good speed, and are very dependable. They're 
upperclassmen..their chances of fumbling or 
misjudging a punt are less than a younger 
kid. For kickoff returns, I really can't say 
right now.
TARTAN: What about the kids you have 
coming in this year. We've heard some fine 
things about them...
LACKNER: I think our freshman crop this 
year is as good a freshman crop as we've had. 
We're just very, very pleased...there are a lot 
of freshmen in backup positions, and you 
like to being a kid along slowly, but at the 
same time you've got to place your best 
people in the lineup, in a starting role or a 
backup role. We're finding our depth is not 
what we want it to be, and whenever you are 
backing up with freshmen , it's obvious they 
don't have whole lot of experience. But we're 
very pleased with their athletic ability, we're 
very pleased with their performance in camp, 
and I'm pleased with the way the coaches 
have been working with them and getting 
them ready to play.
TARTAN: How did you sort your personnel 
out to fit the new defense? *
LACKNER: Basically, the kids who have 
the athletic ability to cover the pass are 
outside backers. Kids who are more physical, 
who dont cover the pass as well but are 
better on the pass rush are going to be our 
defensive ends.
TARTAN: Okay, what about the guys not 
in camp this year? It seems you had a lot of 
guys quit the team...
LACKNER: A ton
TARTAN:
problems.
.A couple guys with academic
LACKNER: There's some with academic 
problems, there's one who transferred, there's 
a couple who have been great 
dissappointments to us that they didn't come 
out. These things happen. My only 
comment about that is we're going to do the 
greatest job of coaching in America this year 
to get the kids who want to play football 
ready to play. Those who don't want to make 
the sacrifice academically, those who don't 
have the heart to play football, or lost 
interest in playing, that's fine. Theyre not 
being paid to play football here. But those 
who want to make the sacrifice and play for 
this football team, those are the kids we 
want, those are the kids we want to coach, 
and those are the kids that are going to make 
us a great football team. Those other 
people...I can't worry about people who 
aren't in camp. I'm going to worry about the 
ones I have in camp who want to play.
TARTAN: What about the guys who have 
the heart, have the desire, but their grades 
just aren't cutting it?
LACKNER: Then they are going to have to 
work harder academically. They are here to 
be a student first. Four years from now, the 
Bengals, the Eagles, the Bears and the 
Steelers aren't going to banging on their 
door. Alcoa, US Steel, IBM, hopefully 
they'll be banging on their door. You're here 
to be a student first. If their grades aren't 
good enough, its not because of football, 
because football is only about an hour and a 
half of your time a day. Every student on 
this campus...takes an hour'and a half and 
does something, whether it be watch the 
Beverly Hillbillies, shoot pool, go down to 
the bar in the fraternity house...go out on 
the cut and throw a frisbee, every student on 
this campus takes an hour to two hours 
every day to get a little mental relief. 
Football is not the reason they are not 
performing academically....In fact, I think 
the greatest way to relieve yourself of 
academic pressure is to put on your helmet 
and go out there and hit somebody. It was 
the greatest thing that ever happened to me 
in my college career....just strap on a 
helmet, forget about the history, the 
calculus, the physics, the chemistry or 
whatever, just go out there, make my read, 
and go hit somebody.
TARTAN: Let's talk about people who are 
in camp. Your captians. What kind of 
leadership role do they play for you?
LACKNER: First of all, they have big 
shoes to fill. The captians last year were 
great, a super group of kids. Bobby Butts, 
Dave Richards, Mike Paterchak and Brad 
Sherwin were great leaders, they led by 
example, they were very much team 
oriented, they didn't worry about how many 
tackles they had, they didn't worry about 
somebody running the ball over them...they 
wanted one thing: to win. That was their 
only goal. And the only goal, so far that I 
can see out of Ron Orie, Mike Hensel, 
Timmy Denmeade, and Mike LaValle is to 
go undefeated. ...I'm very, very pleased with 
the captians - they communicate, they're 
good examples, and I couldn't be more 
pleased .
TARTAN: Its been several months since 
your appointment as head coach here at 
Carnegie Mellon. How do you feel about 
"wearing a new pair of shoes?"
LACKNER: Older. The paper had it right, 
the Post Gazette the other day said I was 
"prematurely graying" and I'm getting grayer 
by the day. I'm not feeling outside pressure 
from the administration...they have 
communicated to me that they are very 
pleased with my appointment and that they 
feel confident I'm going to do a fine job 
here. Most of the pressure is coming from 
within ... I'm a spoiled football coach who 
wants to do well. I have 78 kids in camp 
who want to do well. Of those 78, we'll find 
22 kids who want to play, and 22 to back 
them up. To the rest of those kids who don't 
want to play, then fine, I'm not worrying 
about you. I'm worrying about the 78 who 
are here, and I worry about the ones like 
Frank Meehan, who's in the hospital, who 
made the sacrifice, who's playing because he 
likes playing, who was vying for a starting 
position, and he goes down with 
appendicitis. These others, I dont worry 
about.
TARTAN: What kind of support have you 
gotten from the campus community since 
being named head coach?
LACKNER: Ive had positive reaction to my 
appointment. I feel very confident that 1 
going to be able to work closely with
admissions and those people, and I think that 
they've come to know me over the years. I 
don't go to bat, admissions-wise, for a kid 
who I don't feel can be sucessful, and they're 
not going to give me anybode who they feel 
can't be sucessful...From the whole 
university I've had nothing but positive 
response. Nobody's come up to me and said, 
"Boy, they made a bad decision." I've gotten 
good response from professors to 
administrators all accross the board
TARTAN: How would you compare your 
relationship with Athletic Director Jim 
Banner, as compared to Chuck Klausing's 
relationship?
LACKNER: Mr. Banner, I honestly believe 
that he wants to see me do well, and he 
wants to see our staff do well. I think 
anytime you hire a new coach you want the 
community to feel you've made a good 
decision. I think he has made a good 
decision...now I've got to go out and prove 
that. Chuck had great rapport with the 
players. Chuck was considered to be, and in 
my eyes he is, one of the greatest football 
coaches in the country. I thank him daily in 
my prayers for being able to work for the 
guy for that number of years. He had 
somewhere around 60 or 70 wins under his 
belt as a college coach coming into this job. 
I don't have a loss, but I don't have a win, 
either. Anytime you have a new head coach, 
even though I was a part of the staff the last 
couple years, I'm going to be doing some 
things differently than Chuck did them. 
Other than this freshman class, our 
sophomores, juniors, and seniors, they're 
getting a combination of Chuck Klausing - 
Rich Lackner. over the next couple years.
This freshman class never had an 
experience with Chuck, it's all new, and 
when they're seniors, that team will be all 
Rich Lackner's, and Tery Bodnars, and Rich 
Erdlyis...those are the kids that we found, 
that we recruited, that we brought in, that we 
coached from day one. At that point, that 
would be a good time to judge Rick Lackner 
and the rest of the staff, and see "What have 
they done?"
TARTAN: Could you give us a rundown of 
you opponents this year?
LACKNER: We were at a kickoff luncheon 
about three weeks ago. Everybody seems to 
be graduating one or two starters offensively 
and defensively, when we're losing five or 
six every year. Maybe that's one of the 
reasons weve been sucessful.
We've had kids come up through the ranks, 
maybe not start as a freshman or a 
sophomore, but the help you out their junior 
and senior years and then they graduate. 
Thats one of the badthings about college 
football. You lose those kids after four or 
five years, and that always hurts.
But they all seem to be very confident that 
they are going to be competitive in the 
league this year. I think that W&J is going 
to be extremely strong. I think Hiram, with 
their quarterback, is going to be a very 
strong opponent for us. And I think the 
other teams, accross the board, have made 
improvement. Last year, Bethany was very 
young. They're now a year older, a year 
stronger, a year faster, a year wiser, and more 
experienced.
TARTAN: And we play them down there [at 
Bethany]...
LACKNER: And wey have them down 
there, which is always tough. John Carroll 
seems to have done a good job recruiting, 
and Frank Amato seems to have done a good 
job bringing his team along. Thiel..we beat 
them pretty good last year, up there. But 
Mark Venice seems very confident that his 
team has made great strides in the offseason. 
Grove City, Chris Smith has done a very
Lackner as offensive coordinator
fine job there. Chris is a very good man for 
Division III football ...There's not a weak 
link. For me to say that this team or that 
team is going to be poor this year would be 
very foolish.I think they are all going to be 
competitive.
TARTAN: Last year, the Bucknell game. 
That seemed to be the game that really 
seemed to get your momentum going...Do 
you think the Case game could be a similar 
situation?
LACKNER: Case is a very formidable 
opponent. Right now, we're looking to beat 
Allegheney, and then we'll take Case. But 
I've talked with some different people about 
Case, and they seem to be ver, very strong 
up front. W're playing them up there, which 
is always difficult, and we are going to have 
a real challenge in front of us. I'm glad we're 
not playing Bucknell. They were a team we 
caught by suprise a little bit. We had a game 
uder our belt, and they didn't. As a staff, 
we're pleased we are back in Division. We 
are back in with Case, who looks extremely 
strong...We'll take it a game at a time.
TARTAN: A coach or general manager is 
usually given a certian amount of time in 
which to achieve a certian level. What is 
your target time-wise and what do you wish 
to do within that period as head coach?
LACKNER: If I had my choice, I'd win a 
national championship this year. And that's 
what we are trying to do. We are going to 
try to do it one step at a time, but I think 
that's the ultimate goal of almost any 
Division III college in the country, as it is 
in Division I or Division II. Like I said, it's 
really not going to be totally this staffs 
team until four years down the road, because 
the upperclassmen were very loyal to Chuck, 
as they should be, as I was... It's an 
adjustment period for them. Its an 
adjustment period for me, moving from a 
coordinator to a head coach, but I've set my 
own timetable. I would hope that 1 could 
start to achieve some of the sucess Chuck's 
achieved, over the next couple years. I don't 
think I'm going to win my hundreth game in 
four years, but down the road, I hope to be 
very sucessful. And 1 hope this can be a 
great start.

A New Era Brings A New Defense
By Neil Greenblum 
Tartan Supplement Editor
Did you ever notice what's happened to 
football defenses? These days, everyone's 
using the Cowboys' Flex defense, or the 
Bears' 46 scheme, or some variation of the 
two. What ever happened to the good old 4- 
3? Well my friend, look no further then our 
very own Tartans.
Under new defensive coordinator Terry 
Bodnar, Carnegie Mellon will switch to the 
traditional pro-style defensive set, consisting 
of four defensive linemen and three 
linebackers. The last several years, the 
Tartans have used a Multiple-50 format with 
five linemen and only two linebackers. Why 
the change? "The 4-3 defense better suits our 
personnel," answered head coach Rich 
Lackner. "We think it will strengthen our 
defense against the pass without taking any 
strength away from our run defense."
That run defense was 18th best in Division 
III last year, yielding a mere 83.1 yards per 
game. Opponents averaged only 3.2 yards 
per attempt running against Carnegie 
Mellon. Overall, the Tartans gave up 9 1/2 
points per game, good for 12th best in 
Division III.
Three year letterman Ron Orie will anchor 
the defense at middle linebacker for the 
Tartans, without graduated partner Mike 
Paterchak. The senior co-captain from 
Cheswick tore up the President's Athletic 
Conference (PAC) last year, leading 
Carnegie Mellon in tackles with 90 while 
garnering honorable mention all-PAC 
honors. Orie also had an interception and a 
fumble recovery for the Tartans in 1985.
Seniors Tom Frost and Ken Harris, and 
junior Bryan Roessler are the defensive line's 
returning starters. Frost, a Tartan captian 
this year, had 43 tackles in 1985, fifth on 
the team. Harris, who was named secondteam all-PAC, immediately followed Frost 
with 41 stops, while Baldwin HS alum 
Roessler had 24. Harris was third on the squad with 2 1/2 quarterback sacks, and Frost 
was fourth with 2 takedowns.
Tackles Harris and Roessler will be backed 
up by junior Bill Kerr, sophomore Mike 
Bloom, and freshmen Jason Dowdy and Joe 
Casilli. Joining Frost at defensive end will 
be sophomore Mike Brennan, a Central
Tartans against Tartans in practice this year
Catholic graduate, with sophomores Tom Bethel 
Moul and Ed Yurkovich fighting for reserve 
roles along with freshmen Ray Crothers and 
John Heskamp.
Several veterans return to Carnegie 
Mellon's linebacking crew. Chris Haupt, a 
junior from North Hills HS, and sophomore 
Gerry Bosch will flank Orie for the Tartans.
Haupt had 45 tackles last season, fourth on 
the squad, and Bosch was a special teams 
leader, adding 11 stops on the year.
Senior Dan Lankitus and junior Rick 
LaValle are the incumbent linebacking 
reserves. Kams City HS alum Lankitus 
racked up 12 tackles, of which 9 were 
unassisted, while LaValle, a native of
Park, contributed 2 tackles in a 
limited role. Freshman MLB Robert Keller

will back up Orie and Lankitus, and soph 
Mark Brownlee and freshmen David Skinner,
Tartan File Photo
Cornerback Mike LaValle skewers an opposing ball carrier
. IIUIU UJ
Alex Hoffman, and Bill Burch will join 
LaValle as outside reserves.
In the secondary, comerback Mike LaValle 
is the lone returning starter. A senior co
captain, Rick's brother earned second-team 
all-PAC honors last season with 30 tackles 
and an interception. Former halfback Billy 
Cramer, fourth on the Tartans in receptions 
in 1985, will start at the other comer in 
place of junior Frank Meehan. Meehan, who 
inherited alumnus Joe Orlowski's starting 
spot, will miss the season with apendicitis. 
Sophomore Kent Hess and frosh Jeff 
Caringola, Jeff Pockl, and Phil Antonsor. are 
the backups.
As a result of the graduations of Andy 
James and Brad Sherwin, both all-PAC 
selections, the situation at strong and free 
safety is unsettled. Sophomore FS Rob 
Arthur (13 tackles, 3 interceptions in 1985) 
backed up James last year and should start, 
but junior defensive back Jeff O'Hanlon (11 
tackles, 2 interceptions) will challenge 
Arthur for playing time. A greater challenge 
appears at strong safety, with senior Dan 
Preston (11 tackles), sophomores Jim Kelly 
and Jim Camp, a converted quarterback, 
vying for the starting role. Preston, a 
backup last season, came to camp 20 pounds 
over playing weight but should win the job. 
Junior Mike Ross, soph Tom O'Toole, and 
rookies Brian Kirkendall and Mike Danciak 
fill out the reserve ranks.
Punter Joe Mollica (36.2 yards per punt in 
1985) graduated. Split end Bart Patterson, a 
sophomore, will handle the punting chores 
this season.

Once Again, a Potent Offense\
}y Neil Greenblum
nartan Supplement Editor
The Tartans may have changed their 
lefense, but when you have the second best 
>ffense in Division III, only some minor 
uning is necessary.
Carnegie Mellon rolled their way to 434 
rards per game in total offense, a figure 
ottered only by little-known St. Thomas 
College. The Tartans were sixth in rushing 
n the country (268.6 yards per contest), and 
Oth in scoring, averaging nearly 34 points 
er game. New offensive coordinator Rich 
Lrdelyi inherits several of 1985s key 
erformers.
Foremost is senior QB Mike Hensel. "The

Hensel suffered tom knee ligaments 
playing baseball last spring, and is not yet at 
full strength. At press time, he expected to 
be ready opening day at Allegheny, but if 
not, freshman Dean Garofola, junior Chris 
Claflin, and sophomore Laszlo Buda will be 
ready to fill in, replacing Joe Mollica and 
Nick Klipa, who have graduated.
The Tartans return four veterans to their 
outstanding backfield. Senior fullback 
Anthony Collaros inherits Victor Boland's 
starting job. Collaros rushed for 251 yards 
and 4 TDs last season, averaging just over 
five yards per carry. Tim Denmeade, a 
senior, will again start at halfback. The 
Poland, OH native was second on the squad 
in rushing behind Boland with 341 yards on 
73 carries (4.7 yards per attempt) with 4 
TDs. Denmeade was also an excellent 
receiver coming out of the backfield, with 16 
receptions for 208 yards and 2 more TDs, 
second on the team. McKeesport's Mike

wingback for Carnegie Mellon. The 
Elizabeth-Forward HS alum began 1985 as a 
starter, but went down mid-season with a leg 
injury and was unable to return. He stiH ran 
for 276 yards, at a 6.3 yards per carry clip, 
and had a 64 yard run. the Tartans longest 
play of the season. Minjock also added 2 
TD receptions in 1985.
The fourth veteran running back is senior 
WB Gary Marchionna, and with Billy 
Cramer switched to the defensive secondary, 
the Apollo native becomes the lone 
experienced backup. Marchionna, who hails 
from Apollo, had the best average among the 
backs last season (8.3 yards per carry) and 
ran for 166 yards. Junior Billy Heiser, a split 
end in 1985 (4 receptions for 58 yards), 
figures to see time in the backfield behind 
Denmeade. Sophomore Chris Hansen will 
spot Collaros, and freshmen Eric Polkis and 
Chris Trumble join second year man Rob 
Patterson to fill out the backfield reserves.
The split end corps will be without the 
services of Dave "Golden" Richards, a 1985 
second-team Academic All-American who 
has moved on to medical school. Richards, a 
former star at Penn-Trafford HS, led 
Carnegie Mellon in receiving with 25 
catches for 468 yards and 4 touchdowns. 
Senior Roy Teresky was Richards' backup 
last season, and is the leading candidate for

the job. Teresky has five challengers: 
sophomores Bart Patterson, Chris Koscho 
and Joe Mancuso, and frosh Mike Beresford 
and Alan Loveless. Mancuso was a walk-on, 
and Beresford also hails from Penn-Trafford. 
According to Erdelyi, he's similar to 
Richards in many respects. And to confuse 
the issue more, Teresky has missed several 
practices with some nagging injuries, and 
his status is day to day. It's anyone's 
guess...
At tight end, there doesn't need to be 
guessing. Senior Mike Behling and junior 
Tim Kelly will alternate at the position, 
running the plays in from the bench. 
Behling had 5 receptions for 70 yards in 
1985, and Kelly led the receivers with a 26.1 
yards per catch average, grabbing 8 passes 
for 209 yards and a pair of TDs. Behling 
was an honorable mention all-PAC choice, 
and Kelly very easily could have been, too. 
Behling is the better blocker, Kelly the 
better receiver, but they are about even and 
very reliable. Rookies Martin Stovar, 
another Penn-Trafford grad, and Daniel 
Crimmins will vie for the third TE spot.
All-American offensive tackle Rob Butts, 
all-conference center Mark Brado, and the 
versatile Cam Poluszek, a tackle last season, 
have graduated and opened some new holes 
in Carnegie Mellon's offensive front.
Seniors Neal Shipley and Mark Muster, 
second teamers in 1985, will start at left and 
right tackle, respectively. For backups,
Erdelyi will choose from soph Steve
Slesinski and freshmen Brian Mikol, Doug 
Cervenak, Gale King, and Steve Bayda.
At center the Tartans will turn to
sophomore Kai Mebust. Mebust backed up 
Brado last year, and seems ready to take the 
job. Tom Denmeade (Tim's brother) also 
saw action last season at center, and will 
back up Mebust. Muster has filled in at the 
center spot the past three years and would be 
available for emergency duty.
Coming into camp this summer, it looked 
as if the guard positions would be the only 
interior line spots that would feature 
returning starters. Unfortunately, that's only 
half true. Senior Dave Merrigan will start at 
RG, his fourth consecutive year as a starter. 
Junior LG Mike Colucci will not. Colucci 
broke his foot the first day of practice and 
may miss the entire campaign. Fortunately, 
Colucci's 1985 backup, senior Ed Gallager, 
is back and will start for Carnegie Mellon. 
Gallager has been a starter in the past. Terry 
Graham, a sophomore from McKeesport, 
will back up Merrigan, and Russ Hahn, Tom 
Dever, Jim Balouris, Greg Cheney, and Rich 
France will also fill reserve roles.
The offensive specialists will also feature 
some new faces in 1986. Junior placekicker 
Mike Nazzaro isn't returning this season 
despite rating as the second best kicker in the 
PAC last year (34 of 37 extra points and 4 
of 9 fieldgoals). Several kickers came to 
camp competing for the job, but it appears 
as if defensive back Jim Kelly has sewn it 
up. Look for Billy Cramer and CB Mike 
La Valle to head up the kick and punt return 
units for Carnegie Mellon. Cramer was the 
PAC's leading kick returner in 1985 with 11 
returns for 249 yards for a 22.7 average. 
Cramer also averaged better than 9 yards per 
punt return in 1985.
The kicking game is a question mark this year.

Allegheny Gators Could Be Fresh Meat
It's been three years since the Tartans faced 
Allegheny College, but the last game 
between the two teams is still remembered. 
Coming into the game, in October of 1983, 
the Carnegie Mellon football team was 
ranked number one nationwide in Division
III football. The Allegheny Gators were 
mauled by CMU 35-0 in a contest televised 
regionally by ABC. But when the week's 
rankings were announced, the Tartans had 
inexplicably fallen to number two.
While there will be less attention focused 
on the battle between the two foes this year, 
it is still a significant contest. The matchup 
is the debut for head coaches at both schools: 
Carnegie Mellon's Rich Lackner and 
Allegheny's Peter Vass. Both men would 
like to start out with perfect records
Vass differs from Lackner in one respect, 
however, Lackner inherited an 8-1 conference 
champion, while Vaas takes over a team 
that was 1-5 in the North Coast Athletic 
Conference, and 3-7 overall.
The Gators had more than their share of bad 
luck last year, and weren't as bad as their 
record indicates. They lost two games by a 
single point, two others by less than a
Game One
Opponent: Allegheney College
Opponent nickname: Gators
Game location: Meadville, PA
Stadium: Andrew Wells Robertson Memorial Field
Kickoff time: 1:30 pm
Overall record last year: 3-7
Conference: North Coast Athletic Conference
Conference record: 1-5
touchdown, and another by under ten points, within six points of toppling NCAC 
Only once was the team blown out, 28-0 conference champion Denison College, 
versus Dayton. Allegheny even came It is difficult, however, to win with an
offense that averages a bare 12.9 points per 
game, even with a defense that surrendered j 
only 16.5 points per game.
One of the Gators' returning standouts is 1 
wide receiver Jim Stiefvater, a senior from 
West Mifflin, PA. He will be catching 
passes from probabally either Shawn J 
Wolfinger, a senior signal caller, or Doug 
Woods, a sophomore out of Centra] 
Catholic. Another offesnive starter to watch 
is tailback Eddie Taylor, a senior.
Allegheny has a strong anchor on the 
offensive line. Keynoting the protectors is 
offensive lineman Ray Tower, all six foot 
and 265 pounds of him. However, some 
inexperienced underclassmen may be thrust 
into starting situations.
The defense has a stronger complement of 
linemen returning. The big man on the line 
is Dale Tomaino, a 63", 240 pound senior 
linebacker. He is supported by John Gudel, a 
three year letterman from Garfield Heights, 
Ohio, and Chris Mandella, a senior our of  
Norwin High School. Also look for Rob 
Schumacher, a defensive back, to play a 
large role in containing the Gator's 
opponents.
Case Western Reserve - Tough as Always
For the second year in a row, the Tartans' 
second game will be one of their toughest. 
Last year it was Divison I Bucknell, who 
Carnegie Mellon upset 21-10. This year 
the foe is Case Western Reserve, Back on 
the Tartans schedule after a one-year 
absence.
The strength of the CWRU football 
program can be measured by the fact that last 
season's 7-2 record was considered an "off 
year." Over the last four years, the Spartans 
have a 29-6 record, good for an .828 winning 
percentage. Despite the impressive record, 
Case has yet to make the NCAA playoffs 
under Jim Chapman, head coach of the 
Spartans since 1982.
The Case offense lost several potent 
players from last year, most notably AllAmerican guard Mark Raiff. Also graduated 
is tight end Dave Stuczynski and Mike 
Weber, a kicker. Both were all-conference 
selections andeamed honorable mention All 
American status from the Associated Press.
Longtime backup quarterback Mike Denk 
will get the starting nod in this, his senior 
season. He passed for 371 yards and managed 
a .613 completion percentage last year 
playing behind starter Tom Jonozzo. His
Game Two
Opponent: Case Western Reserve University
Opponent nickname: Spartans
Game Location: Cleveland, OH
Kickoff time: 2:00 pm
Overall record last year: 7-2
Conference: North Coast Athletic Conference
Conference record: 5-1
CASE RESERVESPARTANS
high point came last year in Case's final 
game versus Washington of St. Louis. He 
came off the bench with 5 minutes left in
the contest to direct a 69 yard game-winning 
touchdown drive. He will be protected by a 
solid line, anchored by 3 seniors.
Unlike many of the Tartan's opponents, the 
Spartans can mix the running and passing 
games with effectiveness. CWRU's main 
ground threat is running back Bill 
Finesilver, who finished second in the North 
Coast Athletic Conference with 819 rushing 
yards(39 more than W&J star A.J. Pagano. 
He is backed up by Kurt Conway, a 
sophomore who supposedly has blazing 
speed but has seen limited playing time. If 
injuries strike, this may be the weak link in 
the offense.
Case also lost a defensive All-American. 
Defensive back Ron Steponovic graduated, 
and is trying to carve a football career in 
Italy - appropriate for a Pizza Hut AllAmerican. But linebacker Jay Todd was the 
North Coast Athletic Conference's Defensive 
Player of the Year last season, and is 
returning to anchor a solid defense. The 
backfield, however, is inexperienced, and 
may be a weak point. ,
If the Tartans win the contest versus Case, 
it may give them the momentum for another 
trip to the Division III playoffs. On the 
other hand, if Case Western triumphs, it 
may be the Spartans who return to post
season play.
Big Red in the City Doubtful for Dukes Gridders
If the Tartans can keep out of Three Rivers 
Stadium, they should have no trouble 
handling Duquesne. Since the series 
resumed in 1980, Carnegie Mellon has 
defeated the Dukes in five out of six 
meetings. The only exception came in 1981 
at Three Rivers Stadium, when Duquesne 
earned a rainy 27-10 triumph
The Dukes offense looked lost against 
CMU last year, playing their first game in 
four years without the services of star 
tailback Pedro Bowman. But the team has 
had time to develop alternatives. Ten of 
eleven offensive starters are returning, giving 
Duquesne more experience than they have 
had in several seasons.
An important element in that experience is 
the return of the entire offensive line. The 
line should give improved protection to the 
Dukes' quarterbacks, and may encourage use 
of the running game. Junior running back 
Tom White led the team last year with 435 
ground yards, but could use a complement to 
keep defenses from keying on him.
The quarterback job is up for grabs, as 
sophomores Mark Vemer and Jerry Morell 
do battle with each other before taking on 
outside opponents. Both got starting
Game Three
Opponent: Duquesne
Opponent nickname: Dukes

Stadium: Tech Field

Road record: 0-3
opportunities last year. Morell called the 
signals in more games, passing for 919 
yards on the season, but Vemer turned in a
fine performance in the first contest of the 
year versus Femim College. The receiving 
corps is solid, if not distinguished, and is led
by senior Harry Kramer who had 31 
receptions last season.
A weak link in the offense is the kicking 
game. Coach Terry Russell lost both his 
punter and kicker to graduation, and is 
depending on inexperienced newcomers to  
fill both positions.
The team's most potent defensive weapon 
is linebacker Vinnie Vaccarello. He earned 
squad MVP honors as a freshman last year, ' 
and if he continues improving over his team 
leading 101 tackles and 8 sacks, he could 
become the cornerstone for a very stubborn 
defense. Duquesne is more experienced on 
the line this year, as tackles Bill Churilla 
and Chris Peppier, and guard Pat Flynn all 
return. The three have played two seasons 
together, and should be more mature now 
than a year ago. Coach Russell, shouldn't 
have to scrape for players to fill his 
defensive secondary, as he has returnees to 
fill the starting spots.
One other factor mitigating against the 
Dukes this season is their schedule. They 
play six of their nine games on the road, 
including their opener versus John Carroll 
and a streak of four straight from September 
20 to October 11.

Blue Streaks Hoping for a Fast Start in 1986
Game 4
Opponent: John Carroll University
Opponent nickname: Blue Streaks
Game location: At Carnegie Mellon
Stadium: Tech Field
Kickoff Time: 2:00 pm
Overall record last year: 2-7
Conference: Presidents' Athletic 
Conference
Conference record: 2-4
John Carroll University, while not likely to finish at the top of the Presidents Athletic Conference football standings, can already claim one title: the weirdest name. While other teams go by such monikers as Wolverines, Tomcats, or even Tartans, JCU 
dubs is athletic represenatives the Blue
Streaks. /
The Blue Streaks posted an unipressive 2-
7 record (2-4 in the PAC) last year, and were 
whipped by the Tartans 35-0 in the 
conference opener. The Tartans racked up 
459 yards, while the defense held scoreless 
JCU to a bare 150. Mike Hensel was 7 for 9 
passing for 86 yards before he was replaced 
Joe Mollica, and also ran for 37 yards and 
two touchdowns. In their next game, they 
were pummelled even more badly by Case 
Western Reserve, 37-0.
But the team finished strong. Winless after 
six games, the team won two of its last 
three contests, admittedly over mediocre 
Grove City and Thiel. Against Washington 
and Jefferson, the Blue Streaks scored 22 
fourth quarter points to come within one 
touchdown of toppling then-defending PAC 
champion Washington and Jefferson. JCU 
head coach Frank Amato (6-11 lifetime)
hopes last year's laste-season momentum 
will bring him his first winning season.
Don Stupica, who as a freshman split time 
with Greg Debeljak last season, is expected 
to get the starting nod at quarterback. Last 
year he passsed for 498 yards and a .525 
completion percentage, and could be a potent 
passer this year depending on how much he
has matured. Debeljack is still around, 
however, if the Blue Streaks need him.
Stupica has the advantage this year of a 
strong receiving corps, even though John 
Carroll pass catchers were conspicuously 
absent from the PAC leaders. Tim Mahota, a 
junior tight end, let the team with 16 
receptions last year, and was an honarable
mention all conference selection. Split end 
Craig DeMarco could develop into a 
dependable receiver, if he stays healthy all 
year.
Holding the offensive line together will be 
6'3", 237 lb. Jim Lauer. The senior center 
was selected as an honorable mention Pizza 
Hut All-American and was also a first team 
All-PAC selection. Also solid is tackle 
Mike McGarry, who started every game last 
year and was accorded second-team All-PAC 
honors. The rest of the line is relatively set, 
but John Carroll could be in trouble if 
injuries strike.
The punting is the most solid area of the 
team. All-PAC punter Doug Dickason 
averaged 38.7 yards per kick, helping ease 
the pressure on the defense. Placekicker Dan 
Shannon also returns, but he was not tested 
much last year, attempting only three field 
goals, making one.
On the defensive side, the key is Academic 
All-American Joe Burrello, an inside 
linebacker who led the team with 114 
tackles. Most of the defensive line is 
relatively experienced, but the Blue Streaks 
were forced to shift guard John Dragas from 
the guard's spot to fill defensive holes.
Hiram Terriers: A Championship Dark Horse
Despite their uninspired nickname, the 
Hiram Terriers may give the Tartans trouble 
this year. Last year they were trounced 
solidly by the Tartans 35-21 but this team is 
much improved over the one that was 4-5 a 
year ago. Only 5 lettermen have departed, 
and all eleven offensive starters are returning 
to the Terriers.
Hiram will go only as far as their offense 
takes them. Quarterback Ron Devorsky led 
the Terriers to a ranking of 13th nationally 
in Division III passing, and 25th in total 
offense. Needless to say, he was also the 
President's Athletic Conference leading 
signal caller. He managed ten touchdowns, 
and averaged 239 yards per game in the air.
Deworsky holds several PAC records, 
including most completions and most 
passing yards in a single game.
Devorsky connected frequently with split 
end Greg Gorcica, Divison Ill's fourth best 
receiver. He averaged 8.3 receptions p$r 
game for a total of 538 yards and six 
touchdowns.
The passing game is so effective because it 
is complemented by a superb running game.
In addition to having the leading passer and 
the leading receiver, Hiram boasts the PAC's
Another Long Year for the Tomcats
The 1985 edition of the Thiel Tomcats 
were a much improved team over earlier 
versions. On the surface, a 4-5 does not 
seem very impressive. But only by 
considering that the Thiel gridders had more 
victories last year than in the three years 
combined, can the progress made by rookie 
head coach Mark Vennis be appreciated.
In the meeting with the Tartans last year,
Carnegie Mellon annihilated the Tomcats 48- 
3, the third in a series of four consecutive 
losses for the Greenville, PA denziens. They 
did recover, however, to win two of their last 
three contests, triumphing over Bethany and 
Hiram.
Despite losing only six lettermen, the 
Tomcats are losing some of their best.
Graduated are first team All-PAC selections 
Steve Stone (wide receiver) and Dave Snyder 
(linebacker).
Offensively, Thiel had little better than an 
average year. The key will be whether 
quarterback Chris Blakeslee has matured. He 
completed less than fifty percent of his 
passes, averaging 125.6 yards per game. He 
will have to raise both figures if he wants to 
enter the upper echelon of PAC signal 
callers. Despite the loss of WR Steve Stone, the coaching staff still lists the receivers as a one of the Terrier's strengths. secondary will be in vain.
Game 6
Opponent: Thiel College
Opponents nickname: Tomcats
Game location: At Carnegie Mellon
Stadium: Tech Field
Kickoff time: 2:00 pm
Overall record last year: 4-5
Conference: Presidents' Athletic 
Conference
Conference record: 2-4
It would also help if the Tomcats further 
developed their rushing game, which could 
be used to catch sack-hungry defenses off 
guard. Jim Urbania, a fullback, could 
develop into powerful rusher if given the 
ball enough this year. Last season, he carried 
tthe ball 108 times for 356 total ground 
yards, an average of 51.8 yards per contest, 
sixth in the PAC.
The part of the team in need of the most 
attention is the defense. Thiel finished 
seventh, and last, in the Presidents' Athletic 
Conference in team defense. While they 
allowed 37 fewer passing yards in the PAC 
than Carnegie Mellon last year, they gave up 
almost 700 more yards on the ground. The 
team's average of 372.8 yards allowed per 
game was almost 30 off the pace of 1-8 
Bethany and 135 more per game than 
conference leader Washington and Jefferson.
The secondary is strong point, however. It 
helped pick off a team-record 21 
interceptions last year. Defensive back Greg 
Pemus, selected for All-PAC honors, was 
tied for the conference lead in interceptions 
with four. But without improvemen in the 
Tomcats' defensive line, the labors of the
selection last year. He accumulated 780 yards 
on the ground, less that 300 yards under 
John Carroll's total team offense.
Helping pave the way for Stark's 
accomplishments was Jim Scher, an allPAC offensive lineman. Also standing out 
was Troy Fogle, a second-team allconference tight end.
The defense, however, is another story 
altogether. The team is weak at linebacker 
and defensive back, although second team 
All-PAC selections Bob McKenzie (LB) and 
Mike Keman(DB) are returning. Four of last 
year's starters have departed, which does not 
bode well for a defense that finished ahead of 
only Bethany and Thiel in the PAC last 
year. Head Coach Don Charlton admits that 
the Terriers are deficient in defensive backs 
and linebackers, a situation that could lead to 
a lot of high scoring losses for Hiram.
Several freshman are pencilled into the 
defensive backfield. They should see 
sonsiderable playing time, since brother 
combination Jeff and John Borak will move 
out of the backfiled to fill gaps at linebacker 
and saftety. Coach Charloton will reportedly 
simplify the defense, which should make it 
premier rusher, Bobby Starks. Starks, a running back, was a first-team all-conference easier on the freshmen.

Key Losses Could Damage Grove City
The Wolverines were easy prey for the 
Tartans last year. CMU's offense gained over 
400 yards while rolling to a dominating 38-3 
victory. Grove City doesnt seem much 
improved this year, and they lose the home 
field advantage as the series shifts to 
Pittsburgh.
Surprisingly, defense is what held Grove 
City together last year. They surrendered the 
third fewest yards per game in the PAC last 
year, only an average of 276.8, and held 
powerful W&J to seven points, although 
they managed to score only three 
themselves. They also limited Duquesne to 
three points, and Waynesburg to a 
touchdown.
Unfortunately, the offense managed a 
meager three points in that contest, a 
tendency that manifested itself throughout 
the season. In fact, the Wolverines managed 
over 20 points only once last season. The 
key question is whether a reliable starting 
quarterback can be found, although Jeff Cass 
didn't do badly for a freshman last year. Kirk 
Fennell was the team's leading rusher last 
year, but averaged only 49 yards per game. 
Another loss that hurts is Norm White, who

was accorded Grove City Offensive-Player-of 
the-Year honors. The fullback was also 
honorable -mention All-PAC.
There are, however, some bright spots in 
the offensive picture. Two time All-PAC 
and All-District split end Jeff Mateer is 
returning for another season. Last year, he 
rankedsecoiid in the conference in receiving. 
He had 32 receptions for 436 total yards 
and an average of 5.3 receptions in each 
contest.
Another component that the Wolverines are 
gald to have back in their machine this year 
is Mike Kirsch, the second-team All-PAC 
tackle.
The defensive secondary that quarterbacks 
Mike Hensel and Joe Mollica picked apart 
for 300 passing yards is listed as a strengh 
by head coach Chris Smith. Whether the 
secondary has improved or it is an indication 
of the caliber of the team as a whole remains 
to be seen. The defensive line, by their own 
admission "inexperienced," might be even 
more vulnerable to the running game due to 
the loss of All-PAC nose tackle (and 
Wolverine Most Valuable Player) Doug 
Descoteaux.
Formidable W&J Has Home-Field Advantage
The Washington and Jefferson Presidents 
should be the Tartan's most formidable 
opponents this year. They were picked by 
six of the seven PAC football coaches to 
take the conference championship (the lone 
dissident chose Carnegie Mellon).
Last year, W&J was defeated by the Tartans 
24-17, their only loss of the year. Their 8- 
1 record earned them a ranking of 17th in the 
nation, but it wasn't good enough for an 
NCAA playoff spot.
This year, the Presidents may have the 
upper hand. They return sixteen total 
starters, eight on each side of the football. 
Notable among those returnees is A.J. 
Pagano, who W&J is pushing for AllAmerican honors.
Pagano, a junior running back, has led the 
PAC in scoring two consecutive years, and 
was thirteenth in Division III scoring. He 
averaged 9.3 points per game, accumulating 
783 yards last season. He also was an 
integral part of the Presidents' passing 
attack, leading the team in receptions with 
26. An addition to the running game this 
year is DeWayne Jeter, who most Tartan

fans know as a wide receiver and kick 
returner. A senior this season, Jeter was not 
much of a factor for much of last year due to
injuries. W&J hopes he can return to 
sophomore form, when he was a nationally 
ranked kick returner.
Bethany: Another Year in the Basement?
The Bethany Bisons should not be among 
the Tartan's toughest opponents this season. 
Despite losing only one offensive and two 
defensive starters, the material Bisons' coach 
Wally Neel has to work with is mediocre at 
best. The league coaches seem to agree, 
since they picked the Bisons to share the 
PAC dormat with John Carroll, the only foe 
Bethany defeated last year.
Bethany does have one factor in their favor 
versus the Tartans this year: the home field 
advantage. Despite the team's relative 
impotence, their is something about 
Bethany's Rine Field, and the crowd, that 
gives the home team more of an advantage 
than usual.
It will take more than a partisan crowd and 
the friendly confines of a familiar stadium to 
make Bethany a PAC power this year. 
Sophomore quarterback Tracey Finchum 
didn't do badly passing to split end Doug 
Marshall (573 yards, 4 TD's), with an 
occasional flick to running back Tim 
Williams (239 yards, 2 TD's). Tone Perella, 
a guard, who should help shore up the 
ofensive line, but needs some help to solve 
Bethany's woes.
However, the Bisons' lack of a consistent

Opponent nickname:Bisons
Game Location: Bethany, WV
Stadium: Rine Field
Kickoff time: 1:30 pm
Overall record last year: 1 -8
Conference: Presidents' Athletic 
Conference

One reason the Presidents were able to 
switch Jeter to the backfield was the play 
last year of Allen Ruttenberg, who started at 
wide receiver in Jeter's absence. He was 
second in the team in receptions, 5 behind 
Pagano, and caught the most touchdowns. 
Jim Greaves, the other wide receiver, was a 
second-team all-conference pick.
Senior quarterback Rich Riotto excelled 
last year, his first season as a starter. He 
threw for 1,383 yards and twelve touchdowns 
last year, completing a respectable 53 
percent of his passes. Riotto ended the 
season the second-ranked quarterback in the 
PAC, with an average of 172.3 yards per 
game. His presence lends credibility to the 
passing game, and can prove devastating 
against defenses keying on Pagano's rushing 
attempts.
Riotto will be protected by a veteran line, 
led by Matt Walsh, an all-conference tackle. 
The offensive line did a good job last season, 
paving the way for A.J. Pagano's scoring 
title. This year, is should be just as good, 
but there are some new faces, and head 
coach John Luckhardt admits some 
"maturity" is needed.
running game makes the offense one
dimensional. Fullback Don Vandebone is the 
only Bethany player who can be labelled a 
running threat. He rushed for 281 yards last 
season, an average of 46.8 per game. The 
team gained only 1,001 yards on the ground 
last year, less than half the total of PAC 
leading Carnegie Mellon. In team offense, 
Bethany did edge out John Carroll and 
Grove City, but again needs more than a 
doubling in yardage to catch the leaders.
The Bisons play the 4-3 defense, the 
formation to which the Tartans are switching 
this season. Despite having more experience 
with the formation, the Carnegie Mellon 
defense should be superior to Bethany's. The 
team allowed 343 yards per game to 
opposing offenses, over 100 more than 
CMU, and less than 30 fewer than Thiel, 
which brought up the rear in that category.
Important also to the Bisons are the losses 
of defensive backs Joe Reddy and Bill Huff 
to graduation, which puts quite a strain on 
the secondary. But Bethany does boast the 
returning Mike Belardia, a second-team AllPAC linebacker. Also coming back is VIc 
Murphy, also a linebacker, who garnered 
honorable-mention all-conference honors.

Page F15 - The Tartan Football Supplement - September 9,1986
arnegie Mellon Joins A New Conference
By Perry Pierce
Tartan Staffwriter On June 25,1986, Carnegie Mellon joined 
together with seven other reasearch 
universities to form a new national athletic 
conference. The University Athletic 
Association (UAA) includes Case Western 
Reserve University, Cleveland; the 
University of Chicago; Emory University, 
Atlanta; Johns Hopkins University, 
altimore; New York University; the 
niversity of Rochester and Washington 
diversity in St. Louis. All these 
niversities are NCAA Division III members 
most sports.
What binds these universities is their 
:ommitment to acedmic achievement, and 
ie concept of the student-athlete. Each of 
lese universities are committed to research, 
id are located in major metropolitan areas, 
arnegie Mellon Director of Athletics Jim 
anner expressed that the trips to these 
ietropolitan areas "will add to their 
students] educational experience."
Carnegie Mellon President Richard Cyert 
fwill be the association's chairman in 1986. 
President Cyert said that the newly formed 
University Athletic Association "will stress 
the concept of a student-athlete, which seems 
to be diminishing in other intercollegiate 
arenas."
The UAA will begin league play in 1987 
in 21 varsity sports. For the 1986-1987 
athletic year, UAA schools will compete on 
a limited basis. This year, Carnegie Mellon
will play Case Western Reserve in football, 
mens and women's basketball, womens 
track, and fencing. The Tartans will also 
play against New York University and 
Rochester in men's and women's basketball, 
Washington in football, and Johns Hopkins 
in fencing
In 1987, the UAA will begin round-robin 
play in football, mens and women's soccer, 
and men's and women's basketball. These 
sports will have teams playing each other 
only once due to travel costs. But schools 
like Case Western Reserve and Carnegie 
Mellon may play each other twice being that 
the schools are so close to each other.
Carnegie Mellon is currently andwill 
remain a member of the Presidents Athletic 
Conference (PAC). Starting next year, 
Carnegie Mellon will become a full member 
of the UAA, but will continue to play most 
all PAC teams as part of their schedules. 
For example, in football, the UAA only has 
five schools that offer the sport. This will 
allow Carnegie Mellon to play all of its 
previous PAC rivals, as well as local 
schools like Duquesne University.
The UAA has been considered a good idea 
from many viewpoints. "A good aspect of 
the UAA is the ability for UAA schools to 
still play its natural rivals in all sports," said 
Dale Meggas, Sports Information Director at 
Case Western Reserve. "In the first few 
years the UAA rivalries will develop, and 
will receive greater attention," continued 
Meggas. This system retains the current 
level of athletic competition, and will
increase it over the years as UAA schools 
get to play each other more often.
Even though the UAA is a new conference, 
some rivalries between UAA schools already 
exist. Washington University and the 
University of Chicago have played each 
other a few times in football, and will be 
playing each other this year at Chicago. 
Carnegie Mellon is not free of enemies in 
the UAA, as the Tartans have a history that 
includes football games with New York 
University. In 1928, Carnegie Mellon held 
a 6-0 record when they invaded South Bend, 
Indiana, for a game with the 'Fighting Irish 
of Notre Dame led by Knute Rockne. 
Carnegie Tech took care of the Irish, 
winning 27-7. That marked the first time 
Notre Dame lost at home in 23 years. If not 
for a loss to New York University later in 
the season, Tech would have had an inside 
track to a Rose Bowl bid.
The only critisism of the UAA so far has 
been the natural expenses the association 
will produce. Reported estimates for flying 
and travel costs have run from $100,000 to 
$200,000. These estimates are quite high, 
but they are reduced from potential levels, as 
UAA teams will meet often in round-robin 
tournaments as opposed to flying to the 
individual schools for conference games.
Also, the media attention that the UAA 
will receive will offset the costs. "The UAA 
will receive excellent media coverage," stated 
Carnegie Mellon Sports Information 
Director Bruce Gerson. The UAA will be 
covered in some the best media centers in the 
country, like the New York, Chicago, and 
Baltimore areas. The new interest that the 
UAA will produce will hopefully greatly 
outweigh the costs in the long run, as well 
as improve the quality of student life in all 
areas.

Music in '74- pfffi't!
Mozart Joins Weekend
Class.
By DAN WEIR
Tartan Record Critic
Does anyone remember a time when, 
cuddled up to the family television with a 
pack of Pop Rocks, youd spend entire 
summers fixed to the daytime screen - 
addicted to reruns? Between such gems as 
vintage Munsters and McHale's Navy serials, 
directly after those ads for career 
opportunities as a hair and nail specialist, 
there was a segment advertising THE VERY 
BEST OF THE SUMMER OF '74.. Picture 
a happy couple - in a soft light, tripping 
down a beach in their bell-bottoms whistling 
Having My Baby... (spit and rinse). Should 
we be allowed to forget a woeful period of 
our nation's cultural developmerit when 
David Soul ruled the charts for weeks at a 
time? When Rick Dees was considered a 
significant human being? Very simply, yes. 
Unearthing old 8-tracks is like recalling 
fondly your first encounter with poison ivy. 
The period is arguably significant at least in 
its serving as a benchmark for more recent 
summer music. The summer of v86 fares 
comparatively well.
Let's run through some of the summer's 
most memorable moments. 1986 may well 
be remembered as the year of the death of
Cetera, former Chicago frontman, for The 
Glory of Love - which pales by comparison 
to ELP (Polydor) and the ridiculous Touch 
and Go. Now, the good stuff.
It's started already. People have said to me 
they're not buying the new R.E.M. album 
because the band has become so "trendy". To 
that I say, pffft! Cursed be the day when 
people necessarily divorce popularity from 
talent. Lifes Rich Pageant (IRS) speaks for 
itself. Nuff said. As long as we're in the 
south, Guadalcanal Diary (like R.E.M., from 
Athens) released their second album in early 
summer. Jamboree (Elektra) is a more 
balanced album than Walking in the Shadow 
of the Big Man (Elektra). Perhaps in 
reaction to constant comparison to R.E.M., 
the band has redefined their sound somewhat. 
The result is a heavier guitar sound 
throughout the album. A note: Jamboree is 
worth checking out for the hokey cover art 
alone.
Paul McCartney has finally decided to 
make rock and roll again. The new album 
Press to Play (Capital) features the raspy, 
white-soul McCartney has forsaken in recent 
years. Curiously, a large percentage of the 
tracks on the record are co-written. It may be 
the man has realized he ain't what he used to
"progressive" music (I use the term lightly). 
The year the last of the mighty dinosaur 
bands threw in the Towel of Integrity. As a 
long time Genesis fan I find it particularly 
hard to say that Invisible Touch (Atlantic) 
has little redeeming value. I read somewhere 
that the English band's latest work was 
completely conceived in a ten day studio 
jam. That would mean something if Phil et 
al. were noted improvisationalists and could 
write something that at least sounded 
spontaneous. But they're not, and they 
didn't. Their utter boredom shows through. 
Speaking of things I read, I came across 
something about a month ago in Musician 
magazine that will surely interest the people 
at Guinness: amidst several lengthy rock 
reviews was a write-up of GTR's first 
album, reading ... "SHT". No argument 
here. Also nominated for the Old-RockersNever-Die-But-They-Should category is Peter
be... but what's wrong with that? If sharing 
the writing chores means focusing his voice 
and lyric talents as he does here, the decision 
is long overdue.
Also notable among the summer's crop are: 
Jane Siberry's The Speckless Sky (Open 
Air), The Smiths' The Queen is Dead, and 
Sting's live LP, Bring on the Night (A&M) -
a showcase for the fiery ranting missing on 
Dream of the Blue Turtles. Younger bands to 
keep an eye on are Philadelphia's, The Dead 
Milkmen and Hoboken's, The Feelies.
So, there you have it; an admittedly scant 
list of the summer's best and worst, 
apologies to those I missed. Truth be told, I 
had more fun writing up the bad than the 
good. 1986 may fall far short of 1974 with 
regards to volume in bad music, but I think 
it a noteworthy consolation that this 
summer's crap is probably the best produced 
crap in music history.
just what is Weekend Class? 
Relax, it's not more school. 
It's a chance to enjoy the 
Pittsburgh Symphony at unbeliev
able student discounts. Mozart 
is just one of the music masters 
we've lined up this season 
to make Weekend Class a 
memorable experience.
ow, for $28 you can sub

In November 1973, Cliff Shaw was stricken with cancer.
Fortunately, it was detected early enough. And with 
surgery, Cliff was able to continue living a healthy, active life.
There was a time when such a diagnosis was virtually hopeless.
But today, cancer is being beaten. Over the years, weve 
spent $500,000,000 in research. And weve made great 
strides against many forms of cancer.
With early detection and treatment, the survival rate 
for colon and rectal cancer can be as high as 75%. Hodgkins 
disease, as high as 74%. Breast cancer, as high as 90%.
Today, one out of two people who get cancer gets well.Its a whole new ball game.

Health Center Revamping 
to Enhance 
Quality of Life
During the summer, the university redesigned the 
entire student health care system. The administration, 
particularly Dean Braden Walter, should be commended 
for recognizing the problems in the previous system and 
for addressing the problems thoroughly.
The time and effort put into this project demonstrates 
well-placed concern about issues that are not strictly 
academic in nature. It is refreshing to see that the 
adminstration of this university is finally aware that 
there is more to the college experience that text books 
and test tubes.
In the future, students should expect, in fact demand, 
that the administration continue to pay attention to 
"quality of life" issues. The expansion and improvement 
of the health care system is certainly a step in the 
proverbial right direction.
Campus Wiring 
Causes Problems
In the past few monthes, most of the campus was 
wired to accomodate the new Andrew computing 
network. Admittedly this is a big job, but in some areas, 
particularly the fratemitites, more coordination and 
careful planning would have been in order.
In each house, a wiring closet to contain all of the 
individual cables is necessary. According to some 
fraternity brothers, the wiring closets which were 
constructed over the summer conflict with fire 
regulations and will have to be rebuilt. The Office of 
Telecommunications says, "The wiring closets are not a 
problem." In some of the frats, wires were left hanging 
from the walls, wrapped with tape. Telecommunications 
says all existing wires were purposely left intact so as not 
to disturb phone lines, and adds that they "know of no 
instances in which electrical tape was used in the 
fraternities."
So which is it? And furthermore, why is the 
Telecommunications Office unaware of the contractor's 
activities? The magnitude of this project would explain a 
few failures or oversights, but such significant errors 
and the general lack of communication seem 
inexcusable.
Welcome Back 
to Students
The Tartan editorial board would like to welcome 
students back to campus. We hope that the summer was 
fun and that you look forward to another school year.
Over the summer, Carnegie Mellon saw many 
improvements. The Helath Center was reorganized; 
some of the dorms were remodeled, and the Vali-dine 
system was expanded to serve Scotland Yard, the 
bookstore, the artstore the Co-op and Entropy, to name a 
few of the changes. We hope that as students, you will 
enjoy the benefits of these changes and work to continue 
to improve the quality of life at Carnegie Mellon.
How Should We Respond to Terrorism?
By Jack L. Poller
Photography Editor 
In the past week, there have been 
two major terrorist attacks. One, 
in Karachi, Pakistan, was directed 
at us, the United States. The dead
are still being counted. Why, many 
people ask, do terrorists attack 
innocent civilians and not the 
military? Why the United States? 
How should we respond to the 
attacks? These questions can be 
answered quite simply.
A terrorist strikes at the civilian 
population for two very important 
reasons. First, he gains notoriety 
and publicity through media 
coverage of the atrocity he 
commits. By gaining publicity, 
the terrorist informs the population 
of his desires. Second, and more 
important, the act of terror puts 
fear into the free population of a 
country. A scared population can 
force its government to help the 
terrorist in achieving his goals. 
The result of recent acts of terror 
can be seen in less overseas travel 
by Americans, most of whom were 
afraid of being singled out during a 
terrorist attack.
If the terrorist were to attack a 
military target instead of a civilian 
target, he would essentially be 
declaring war on the country he 
attacked. The military is a group 
that is prepared, willing and able to 
fight back, which creates a 
problem for the ill-equipped 
terrorist. The terrorist also 
alienates the civilian population, 
thereby losing his power of 
coercion over the government.
Why, then, does the terrorist 
direct his attacks at the United 
States, the world's strongest 
country? Obviously, the terrorist 
does not think that the United 
States is very strong, or he would 
not attack. Clearly, as can be seen 
over the past few years, terrorists 
who direct their attacks at the 
United States have suffered little 
and gained much. The United 
States is very slow to place blame 
and slow to punish. The terrorist 
sways popular opinion in the 
U S. towards his goals, while not 
causing any harm to himself.
During the past two 
administrations the terrorism 
policy has been one of passive 
response. The U. S. cleans up after 
the atrocity, but does not attempt 
to punish those responsible. This 
policy has achieved nothing for the 
U. S., but much for the terrorists. 
Over the past few years, the 
number of terrorists atttacks 
against the U. S. has increased 
dramatically; the terrorists see that 
while they can hurt the United 
States, it won't attempt to hurt 
them, reinforcing the positive 
aspect (for the terrorist) of
Incidentals Add Up
By Jay Katz
When I first started Carnegie 
Mellon, I noticed under expenses 
there was a category entitled 
"incidentals." I wondered how one
student could waste $750 on these 
"incidentals."
Little did I know that as a college
terrorism.
Instead of reinforcing terrorism, 
the U. S. could destroy it by active 
retalliation. When the U. S. 
attacked Libya in retalliation for a 
terrorist attack, the were many 
verbal protests. But not one 
terrorist attempted to attack the U.
S. In retalliating an act of terror, 
the U. S. has shown that it does 
have some muscle.The policy of 
active, physical response has been 
used succesfully by many countries 
to fight the plague of terrorism.
If the United States would 
respond by treating the cause of the 
problem, not the symptom, the 
number of acts of terror would 
decrease dramatically. There are 
three major sponsors of terrorism 
in the world. The Soviet Union, 
and its surrogates, Cuba and Libya. 
If the U. S. would put political 
pressure on the Soviets, and attack 
terrorist training camps in Cuba 
and Libya, the terrorists would lose 
money, equipment and personell. 
This would severly limit the 
ability of the terrorist to inflict 
damage on the U. S. If the U. S. 
declared war on terrorism, it could 
erradcate a large problem in a very 
short time. "
student, I would become adept at 
throwing away large quantities of 
money with very little effort. But
I can explain.
Non-college students, especially 
parents, marvel in agony about 
these extra college expenses. Well, 
it seems that college students are 
targeted for every salable 
commodity by every supplier 
within a one hundred mile radius.

Bureaucratic Quagmire Prevents Policy Making
By Lisa D. McAnany
Carnegie Melton's investment policy with 
regards to South Africa is still a point of 
^ntmversy and indecision. The
measures taken thus far have been half
hearted, bureaucratic attempts at addressing
the issue.Last April, the CMU South African 
Investment Policy Committee was formed to 
make a proposal to the Carnegie Mellon 
Board of Trustees. The Committee was 
comprised of three students, three faculty 
members, three administrators, and three 
staff members. On August 29, the 
Committee presented its resolutions to 
President Cyert, and the proposal was 
considered by the Executive Committee of 
the Board of Trustees on September 8.
The substance, and I use that term loosely, 
of the proposal consists of six resolutions, 
which the committee presents as a whole and 
suggests that they be "taken as a whole and 
that they be adopted as a package." The six 
resolutions are as follows:
1. The Trustees of Carnegie Mellon 
University should place their explicit
condemnation of apartheid and the present 
policies of the South African government 
which are based upon an institutionalized 
form of racism entrenched in the political 
and legal systems of the country.
2. Trustees have a fiduciary 
responsibility to manage the endowment so 
as to achieve the highest returns consistent 
with the level of risk accepted as appropriate. 
The committee recognized that in rare or 
unusual circumstances the Trustees may 
properly elect to deviate from this policy.
3. Given the present political situation, 
the trustees may properly elect to deviate 
from their normal investment policy.
4. The involvement in South Africa of 
American companies whose conduct does not 
conform to ideals and goals such as those 
expressed in the Sullivan Principles is of 
concern to the committee.
5. The Board of Trustees should appoint 
a committee of interested members of the 
Carnegie Mellon University community to 
investigate the behavior of companies in 
which the University holds stocks or bonds 
to determine whether their actions conform 
to the Sullivan principles or their equivalent.
6. The Board of Trustees should adopt 
the following procedure for reviewing future 
issues to ascertain whether or not they 
warrant a similar response:
Student Expenses
continued from page 16
Hie independent merchants of Oakland 
seem to just thrive on our bank accounts. 
Pizza places, most of all, make it easy for 
students to spend their money lazily by 
bringing their food to any specified location. 
Discos and bars splatter advertisement all 
over the place reminding students to come to 
their location with full wallets.
But there are many other sources of sellers 
right on campus. Fraternities always seem to 
be holding some sort of raffle or candy sale 
to raise money for whatever cause the 
fraternities choose.
Amongst ourselves, we try to sell all our 
old and useless stuff so we can buy new and 
useless stuff. I surveyed the Morewood, 
Skibo, and Baker Hall bulletin boards to try 
to get the gist of what is being sold. I found 
that those of us who happened to have a lot 
of money can buy cars, tv sets, sofas, 
books, college rings, and what every CMU 
student needs, a typewnter.
But CMU tries the hardest to grab our 
blank checkbooks from us despite the fact 
that most of our money is already in their 
massive piggy bank. \in subtle ways, such 
as vending and video game machines, we 
probably support someone's yatch or Florida 
condominium.
There are so many subsidiaries of die CMU
conglomerate on this campus. Included in 
this are the art store, electronics store, music 
store, and the University Dining Service.
Also, the bookstore must make a nice 
profit through not only the sale of books but 
also through the clothing, posters, and candy 
that one would expect to find in a bookstore. 
You can go to the store intending to buy a 
Statistics book and leave instead with the 
1987 The Far Side Calendar. That is exactly 
what I did last week (hey,it wasn't difficult 
to decide).
Another source of cash for CMU's wealthy 
stockholders comes form the frequent 
sponsorship of poster, book and flower 
sales.
Personally, I have spent money on items 
ranging from headphones, posters and 
albums. I am already sick of listening to the 
Cash-Stream machine spit out money at me. 
I wouldn't mind as much if the receipt didn't 
always give me a grim reminder of my new 
account balance.
Ive noticed that everyone is always so nice 
to you just before they take your money 
from you. And you laugh and talk with these 
people until you realize that you only have 
four dollars and seventy-one cents left in you 
bank account. I hope that doesn't happen to 
you but if it does. I'll be there to laugh at 
you and talk to you.
The editorial and production staffs apologize to the readers of the Tartan for any inadequacies in this issue of thc newspaper. We are still adjusting to a new typesetting system which was instal 
at the end if the summer.
a. In response to a petition from the 
Faculty or Student Senate, the board of 
Trustees, in consultations with the President 
should appoint a committee of students, 
faculty, administration and trustees charged 
to consider whether the particular 
circumstances are rare a
b. If the committee finds that the 
Trustees should deviate from the University's 
normal investment policy and the Trustees 
concure, the Trustees should appoint a 
committee to monitor the University's 
investments in accordance with the specified 
non-fmancial criteria and to recommend 
appropriate actions to the trustees.
In my opinion, these resolutions are 
carefully-worded statements which ultimately 
say nothing. The only action which this 
committee has proposed is the formation of 
another committee, an almost hopelessly 
ineffectual way of confronting the problem. 
The resolutions mention the Sullivan 
principles but not to the extent of either 
supporting or rejecting them. The committee 
merely expresses "concern" about 
conformity with these guidelines.
In the "Notes to Resolutions 
Recommended by CMU South African 
Investment Policy Committee," it is stated 
that, "Some [members of the committee] 
dissented from these resolutions on the 
grounds that although thet are a positive 
stip, the consequences are ineffective." Hear, 
hear.
Perhaps it is the hope and intention of the 
administration that this touchy issue be 
sucked into the quagmire of self-perpetuating 
bureaucracy. If that is indeed the case, 
however, the administration should have the 
courage of its convictions and simply admit 
that for the administration, apartheid is not 
an issue relevant to the investment policy of 
this university.
To give the committee the benefit of the 
doubt, I should say that I realize the 
difficulty in reconciling twelve individuals 
on an issue as complex as this one, but 
recognizing the difficulty in making policy 
decisions is not an excuse for simply not 
making them. As President Cyert reminded 
us in the Octovber 22, 1985 issue of the 
Tartan, "If you do nothing, you are taking a 
stand."
The Tartan staff would like to extend its sincerest thanks to Lee Miller of the Carnegie Mellon Art and Technology Center for devoting enormous amounts of personal time and effort to the production of this issue. His technical assistance was both excellent and essential.

Katz Takes on the Pirates
By JAY KATZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Well, I didn't expect to write anything for 
sports this year, but I couldn't resist this 
one. I read in a recent edition of the 
Pittsburgh Post Gazette voicing Pirate 
General Manager Jim Ley land's displeasure 
over an ESPN sportscaster's referral to the 
team as "pitiful".
I know Thrift and Leyland are angry but I 
have news for themthese Pirates, if you use 
your imagination, could be thought of as 
pitiful.
Thrift claims to have his public relations 
ace compiling all the positive statistics that 
he can imagine to proce to the world that the 
Pirates are actually a respectable team.
I started to think about what certain 
statistics they could possibly find to 
document their claim to baseball experts and 
convince the other teams to forfeit their 
positions ahead of the Pirates.
For instance, maybe they'll find that the 
Pirates have won 60% of their games on 
thursdays. In that case, with 52 thursdays in 
a year, it would take the Bucs just a little 
over three years to have a successful season.
Perhaps they'll find that Sid Bream has a 
.334 batting average and 6 home runs 
against pitchers bom or naturalized within
the Dominican Republic.
I'm sure they'll point out that Raphael 
Belliard is hitting for a higher average in his 
first year as a starter than Mike Schmitt. 
I'm sure they may neglect to tell us that 
Schmitt had a few more home runs than the 
Pirates stellar shortstop.
And they'll calculate that if Rick Rhoden 
pitched every day, the team would win 105 
games(they might have to staple his arm 
together every now and then).
Of course, if the Buccos weren't involved 
in so many of those dam one run games(and 
won all those that they have lost), they'd be 
right in the race with the Mets.
And guys, don't forget to calculate batting 
averages for all players when it happens to 
be one of the Pirate player's birthday. Do 
that for opposing players, too. If favorable 
for the Pirates, maybe the league will 
schedule their games around these 
circumstances.
I wonder what the team's record is on 
recently mowed and manured natural grass. 
If it is good, perhaps the Pirates could play 
their games on the cut.
How well do the Pirates do when the 
concession stands sell over 3000 hot dogs?
The psychological edge that is given to the 
team when the Pirate Parrot rides his
miniture car around the field must be 
enormous. Check the stats on that one, too.
Larry McWilliams' earned run average may 
be lower when three or more different leftwing religious factions participate in the 
game. Better look into that one.
Further into the article, Leyland is 
reminded  that his team was in last place 
when ESPN aimed that verbal barrage at the
Bucs. Leyland boldly and proudly points out 
that the team Won't be there for ion 
obviously meaning that the Pirates can 
surpass the Chicago Cubs and become the 
25th best team in the majors, out of 26 
teams.
I think not realizing that the Pirates are not 
of World Series quality is, as Jim Leyland 
puts it, "horsefeathers".

Tartan Sports
Cross Country Off to a Good Start
Preview Results
Carnegie Mellon's 1986 men's cross
country team has a tough act to follow to 
say the least. Last fall the Tartans extended 
their winning skein and set a new NCAA 
Division III record by registering their 72nd 
consecutive dual meet victory. Head Coach 
Gary Meckley, featured in USA Today and 
Sports Illustrated, led the '85 Tartans to their 
sixth straight undefeated season and their 
sixth consecutive Presidents' Athletic 
Conference (PAC) Championship. Carnegie 
Mellon, which has set several harriers to the 
NCAA Division III Championships in 10 of 
the past 11 years, has not lost a dual meet 
since 1979.
But, there have been many tough acts to 
follow for the Carnegie Mellon cross
country team. Every year since 1980 
Meckley and company find themselves 
defending the league title, defending their 
regular-season unbeaten streak and challenged 
to produce yet another NCAA national 
qualifier. Tough acts are commonplace on 
the cross-country trails at Carnegie Mellon.
Leading the Tartans this season will be 
returning all-conference performers Paul 
Camine, Keith Stopen, Pat Noll and Tom 
Ford. Camine finished fifth at the PAC 
championships last fall covering the 4.9 
mile course in 27:02. Stopen took seventhlace in 27:20, Noll ninth in 27:33 and Ford 
11th in 27:41. Noll and Camine, who both 
garnered All-East honors, led Carnegie 
Mellon to a fourth-place finish at the NCAA 
Eastern Regional Championships just 
missing a NCAA national berth.
Other runners who Meckley feels will 
challenge for the team's top seven spots 
include freshmen Dave Supp, Len O'Neal, 
Scott Foerst and Chris Johnson. In addition 
Frank Matousek, a very steady runner who 
always seems to be one of the top seven 
according to Meckley, will return form a 
stress fracture he suffered last year.
Supp finished 16th at the Pennsylvania 
State AAA Cross-Country meet last fall for 
West Mifflin High School, and also took 
fifth in the two-mile run at the state AAA 
track meet last spring. O'Neal, a graduate of 
Norwin High School, took 12th place at last 
season's WPIAL cross-country meet and also 
finished strong in the state championships. 
Foerst was rated as one of the top scholastic 
distance runners in Georgia during his high
Not much gets done at 11 AM on a 
Saturday morning at Carnegie Mellon, 
unless you're a member of the men's or 
women's cross country team. Saturday, they 
were out on Flagstaff Hill sweeping 
Duquense University, West Liberty College, 
and Geneva College in their season openers.
The men's scores of 15-50 against 
Duquesne and Geneva and 17-44 versus West 
Liberty raised Head Coach Gary Meckley's 
record at Carnegie Mellon to 299-48. The 
Tartans also extended their NCAA Division 
III Consecutive Dual Meet Record to 79 
meets. Meckley had good words for his 
team after the race, "Well, a lot of questions 
remain unanswered, but theyre very 
aggressive and very enthusiastic. They took 
it easy after the third mile, so they're times 
could have been faster. I'm pleased, but 
there's still a lot of work to go. They all 
could have run faster."
The men were led by junior Keith Stopen 
who ran the course in 26:19 minutes. Close 
on his heels were sophomore Pat Noll and 
freshman David Supp who crossed the finish 
line in 26:25 and 26:26 respectively. After 
the race, Stopen talked about his 
performance and the team, "We (Stopen, 
Noll, and Supp) were right up there. Pat and 
Supp were right behind me. After three 
miles we just took it easy. We've been 
going really easy, we've got a pretty good 
team this year. We've only been here two 
weeks, we're getting used to the schoolwork 
and the books and getting back in the flow 
of things. In a couple of weeks we'll really 
start performing as a team." Meckley had 
this to add about Stopen, "Very good, he's 
done a lot of training this summer. He's 
come around."
The women gave new Head Coach Mindy 
Maxwell two wins by defeating Duquense 
and West Liberty. West Libertys Sherry 
LeMaster took first with a time of 17:38, 
but the next two people across the finish 
line were Lady Tartans, Sue Johnson at 
17:58, and just behind Theresa Pane in 
18:05. Coach Maxwell was also pleased 
with her team's effort. "The girls, most of 
them, cut two minutes of their first meet 
last time. Some of them went two minutes 
or more off their best times. So we're 
looking really good. We have one girl 
(Johnson) who went just off the course

record time. The next girl (Pane) should currently injured, but she should be another
also break the course record in the next two strong runner. We've got a lot of depth this
weeks. We've also got another runner who's year.
Soccer Team Anxious to Prove Itself
With six returning starters and seven 
returning letterwinners from last years team 
that set an unprecedented nine school records, 
Carnegie Mellon is a little bit anxious to 
begin its 1986 season.
"I'm ready to get started," said Head Coach 
Nick G2uwioso 25 ^ gkneed at his list of 
returning players. "Sure wc iTi^e nine 
school records last season, but the two 
records we didnt break that we should have 
was to win our second league championship 
and receive our first NCAA playoff berth."
Gaudioso's most notable returning 
performers who he feels could help the 
Tartans achieve those goals are forwards 
Doug Anderson and Alan Mayr, midfielders 
Kevin Jung and Bob Stefanowicz, and 
defenders Ned O'Byme and Scott Lyon. All 
six led the Tartans to 12 victories, 54 goals 
and 166 points in 1985, all Carnegie Mellon 
records. The Tartans ended its '85 schedule 
with a 12-4 overall mark and a 5-1
Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC) slate 
for second place.
Anderson, a first-team All-PAC selection 
and a three-year letterman, scored 13 goals 
and registered three assists for 29 points to 
rank second on the team and third in the 
PAC. Mayr, who set new Tartan records 
with sever, points and three goals in a single 
game, fitted third on the squad and fourth 
in the league with 10 goal' seven assists 
for 27 points.
Jung, a two-time All-PAC pick, was 
named first-team All-Pennsylvania, New 
Jersey and Delaware for his performance as a 
sophomore last season. Jung established a 
new school record with 18 assists and added 
three goals for 24 points in 85. Stefanowicz 
scored two goals and had three assists for 
seven points while earning a starting role as 
a freshman with outstanding play.
O'Byme and Lyon turned in impressive 
performances on defense and paved the way
for goalkeeper Sam Montague who recorded 
a 0.92 goals-against-average and five 
shutouts. Montague graduated last May.
Freshmen whom Gaudioso expects to 
contribute this season include midfielders 
Eddie Park from Roanoke, Va., Binh 
Nguyen from Manassas, Va., and Keith 
Rohland from Oakton, Va., defenders Gerry 
Stocker from Toms River, N.J., Geoff 
Wilson from Manlius, N.Y., and Chuck 
Shuanda from Holland, Pa., and goalkeeper 
Keiu V"el frm Freeport, N.Y.
