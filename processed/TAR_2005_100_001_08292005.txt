THE TARTAN
Volume IOO, Issue ICarnegie Mellons Student Newspaper since 190629 August 2005
A?WELCOME BACK.
Take a page  any page  from your new, bankbreaking text book. Rip it out. Read it, memorize it, and 
stuff it in a shoe box. In twenty years, will you remember 
what you just read?
But you will remember Orientation. Youll remember that 
research project you did in the Gates building, and your 
gravity tests in Global Studies House. You will remember 
screaming around Schenley Drive in a 12-inch-tall buggy, 
and the controversial speaker who ignited campus in
impassioned conversation. These are the things that really 
shape who we are.
And thats what this newspaper is for.
Were here to chronicle, digest, investigate, and discuss 
what youll want to remember. For this special first issue, 
weve culled the research, events, and campus accom
plishments of our summer hiatus, and put them into the 
light. Weve also set aside space in our Pillbox feature to 
help the class of 2009 look beyond Orientation, and maybe
get a dose of CMU reality along the way.
It may only be the first week of classes, but already 
important events have changed the face of our campus. The 
Tech Street trucks move has sparked a petition movement. 
The fraternity quad has a little less fraternity. Our new stu
dent government is working through a rocky transition. And 
theres going to be a lot to come.
For 100 years, weve carried the torch of student journal
ism on the CMU campus. This is your voice.

Housing implements major facility changes over the summer
by Franklin H. Williams
Managing Editor
With the advent of a new 
school year, we find many 
new changes and additions 
to Carnegie Mellon housing. 
While some changes may be too 
small to notice, other projects 
are much larger  some cost
ing millions of dollars. Below 
is a list of the additions and po
tential changes over the course 
of the summer.
 Tim Michael, previously 
head of Housing Services, has 
been promoted to head of the 
newly formed Office of Housing 
& Dining Services, which is now
centered in a new Morewood 
Gardens office.
 Skibo Coffeehouse has re
ceived a major upgrade to its 
service facilities and kitchen, 
emphasizing a new menu cen
tered around the use of freshly 
prepared foods. Skibos spiral 
staircase has been removed 
and new sounded and lighting 
equipment has been installed 
in partnership with AB Tech to 
turn Skibo into a better perfor
mance venue.
 Because C.K. Pretzels con
tract has expired, S Seor has 
moved into C.K. Pretzels old 
space, giving S Seor a larger 
and improved area across from 
its old location. The new food
location Bento Bowl, special
izing in made-to-order stir fry, 
egg rolls, and Asian salads, has 
been added in Si Senors old lo
cation.
 Kosher Korner and the 
salad bar now have larger and 
more prominent locations in 
the UC Food Gallery.
 A nw Create-A-Block 
program is being established 
to make the selection of block 
meals simpler.
 A new three-day-per-week 
special dining program will 
serve small groups of students 
restaurant-style meals in the 
University Center by reserva
tion.
 A multi-phase reconstruction of the closed dining space 
in Resnik House, previously 
Highlander, will reopen the 
dining room at the  beginning 
of the spring semester. It will be 
completely renovated to include 
an area for fitness equipment, a 
convertible dining and perfor
mance practice space, and a 
dining area including a coffee 
bar-and other food venders.
 A multi-year project cost
ing over $2 million to restore 
the Morewood Garden parapets 
has been completed.
 Four new fitness centers 
have been added in Morewood 
Gardens, Mudge, Margaret 
Morrison Intersection lounge, 
and Shady Oak.
 The former Delta Tau 
Delta and Delta Upsilon 
houses were renovated, each 
costing over $1 million. DTD 
now serves as the Kappa Alpha 
Theta sororitys new house, 
and DU as the Global Studies 
house for first-years.
 The Veronica parking lot 
was paved and improved. Its 
now been added to the cam
pus parking system.
 Finally, the electronic 
card ID system is moving to 
the HUB, so students will no 
longer need to make an ad
ditional stop at the Office of 
Housing & Dining Services 
to purchase or receive a new 
card.

Youve got a copy of The Tartan in your 
hands. That is a much greater accom
plishment than you might imagine.
Im very proud to present the first issue 
of The Tartans 100th volume. A century 
ago, a small group of students set out to 
inform their peers of the newsworthy 
happenings of the day. Since then, the 
newspaper those students created has 
evolved into the most complete record 
of the student experience at Carnegie 
Mellon University.
Since 1906, more than a thousand 
students have contributed to The Tar
tan. News writers, photographers, col
umnists, artists, layout designers, edi
tors, production managers, advertising 
staff, business managers, and personnel 
managers have built The Tartan issue by 
issue. Each of those thousand students 
has contributed to the copy of The Tartan 
that you hold in your hands. This news
paper was a long time in the making.
With such a long and rich history, its 
disheartening to hear about declining 
newspaper readership nationwide. Many 
people say that the speed and accessibil
ity of online news will kill the newspaper, 
in the end. The vast, searchable body of 
online news will forever be more up-todate and instantaneously accessible, but 
a physical newspaper like The Tartans 
print edition has a potency that online 
news has yet to match.
A newspaper is much more than the 
paper and ink used to make it. A news
paper is even more than the words on its 
pages. Newspapers can do what no other 
medium can do. The newspaper unites.
As you read this newspaper, there is 
a good chance that someone you dont 
know will see you reading it and pick 
up a copy. As soon as that happens, you 
and that stranger have common ground. 
Youre aware of the same issues. Youve 
read the same commentary. Whether or 
not you both agree on the issues, youve 
got something to talk about.
Watching TV at home or listening to 
the radio in the car are not actions visible 
to others. Reading a paper in the UC is. 
A newspaper is a tangible thing you can 
carry with you. Its conspicuous form tells 
the people around you that you are read
ing the news. In that way, it links read
ers who might otherwise not know what 
they have in common. A newspaper can 
help to build a sense of community.
Giving people common ground is espe
cially important at our university. In spite 
of all its strengths, Carnegie Mellon has 
a significant weakness. The administra
tion, the academic colleges, the student 
organizations, and the residential life are 
all highly decentralized. And this divi
sion extends beyond the university itself; 
we still face divisions on the basis of gen
der, race, and creed.
Groups of people within this com
munity are very disconnected from one 
another, and it has prevented us from 
adequately dealing with significant, 
community-wide problems effectively in 
the past.
When we let the groups that make 
up our community become distant, dia
logue comes to a halt. But dialogue can 
help to keep the groups in our commu
nity together. It is my first wish that, in its 
century-long tradition of informing the 
student body, serving as a public forum, 
and chronicling the student experience, 
Thfe Tartan can help lead our communitys 
discussions. This is our contribution to 
creating a stronger community.
To make our contribution count, we 
will strive to create an ever improving 
newspaper. First, we will retain our dedi
cation to providing accurate news cov
erage and diverse, intelligent opinion. 
Second, we will make sure that being a 
member of The Tartans staff remains an 
invaluable experience that can be found 
nowhere else on campus.
Finally, I resolve to reduce The Tartans 
dependence on your student activities 
fee to free up money for other student 
organizations, while continuing to create 
student jobs.
This year will be a strong start for The 
Tartans second century.

CMU wary 
of Academic 
Bill of Rights
by J.T. Trollman
Editor-in-Chief
July 7 was a victory day in Penn
sylvania for conservative activist 
and author David Horowitz. By a 
vote of 108-90, the Pennsylvania 
House of Representatives estab
lished a committee charged with 
investigating students claims of 
political discrimination at public 
state universities.
The committees establishment 
stems directly from Horowitzs 
Academic Bill of Rights, which 
he promoted in several states. His 
Bill of Rights was designed, he 
stated in an article for NewsMax. 
com, to defend intellectual diver
sity1 and codify students academic 
freedoms (while still supporting 
the academic freedom of profes
sors).
The bill makes several propos
als, one of which is to outlaw fac
ulty from using their courses for 
the purpose of political, ideologi
cal, religious, or anti-religious in
doctrination. Faculty must pres
ent dissenting viewpoints to their 
course materials where appropri
ate. The bill also mandates that 
sponsored speakers observe the 
principles of academic freedom 
and promote intellectual plural
ism.
Many employed in education 
have said that Horowitzs phrasings are delibrately vague, and 
could set a dangerous precedent. 
Alfred L. Brophy, a professor 
of law at the University of Ala
bama, was quoted as saying: His 
[Horowitzs] bill would keep uni
versities busy respecting and pre
senting all viewpoints, leaving one 
to wonder when there could be a 
focus on the viewpoints that have 
deservedly gained adherents.
Horowitz has a history at 
Carnegie Mellon: Last November 
The Tartan chose not to run one of 
his ads due to potentially deroga
tory statements, instead issuing 
a statement by then-Executive 
Officer Mark Egerman. A debate 
between Horowitz and Eger
man later aired live on WRCT. A
fN!tf?rowitz 95laterdn*slavery reparations was printed 
in Brown Universitys Daily Her
ald in 2001, after which students 
removed 4000 copies from distri
bution points across campus and 
attempted to forceably enter the 
newspaper office for a remaining 
100 copies.
Several national organizations 
have opposed the Academic Bill 
of Rights, including the Ameri
can Association of University Pro
fessors. In statements between 
December 2003 and July 2005, 
the AAUP officially condemned 
Horowitzs bill as a threat to aca
demic freedom.
However, both Georgia and 
Colorado have now passed bills 
stemming from Horowitzs Aca
demic Bill of Rights proposals, 
and many consider Pennsylvanias 
recent committee approval a simi
lar step in that direction. Although 
Horowitzs original draft imposed 
its rules over both public universi
ties and to private universities that 
present themselves as bound by

New bus routes will take students to Waterfront and the South Side Works
Rising Interest Rates 
for Stafford Loans

Federal financial aid interest rates rise for 2005-2006 school year
by Jim Puls
Online Editor
Just in time for the 2005-2006 
school year, the Port Authority 
of Allegheny County is planning 
major service changes to take 
effect on Labor Day. Of greatest 
interest to Carnegie Mellon stu
dents will be the new 59U service 
to the South Side Works via Oak
land, and the two 61-series buses 
to Squirrel Hill and beyond.
Now, students will finally have 
a public transit option to the 
South Side Works, the one-yearold retail development featuring 
the popular restaurant franchise 
The Cheesecake Factory and a 
multi-screen cineplex, among 
many other stores. The 59U will 
stop at the development before 
serving Oakland on its way to 
the Waterfront after 5:30 pm on 
weekdays, and all day on week
ends and holidays. According 
to Ron DaParma, a real estate 
writer for the Pittsburgh TribuneReview, the new Port Authority 
service is just a first step in in
creasing access to the complex. 
Hopefully, students will take 
advantage of the service; as Da
Parma said, the ridership needs 
to justify the expense. ~
Justification should be easy, as 
many students have cited poor 
bus access as a reason for not 
patronizing the development. It 
would be an added convenience 
for students.... Bus service would 
make it much more accessible, 
said Diana Miller, a second-year 
architecture student. Miller 
added that she would be likely 
to visit South Side Works much 
more often with the new bus ser
vice.
Most of the 59Us service to 
Century III Mall on weekends 
will be discontinued, save five 
Saturday trips and three Sunday 
trips.
Students requesting more bus 
service to Squirrel Hill, Green
field, and Homestead will be 
pleased with two new bus routes 
that the Port Authority is creat
ing from the 61C. First, the 61D

Food vendor trucks move to Margaret Morrison Street
by Alexandra Kilduff
News Editor
Its estimated that 55 percent 
of Carnegie Mellon undergradu
ates borrow some kind of finan
cial loan to pay for their college 
education, and now that loan 
will be more expensive to repay, 
thanks to a rise in federal finan
cial aid interest rates. The rise, 
which went into effect earlier this 
summer, raised the interest rate 
on most federal loans, including 
Federal Stafford Loans and Par
ent Loans for Undergraduate Stu
dents (PLUS). Previously, interest 
rates on these loans had been at 
their lowest level in forty years.
The Federal Stafford Loan, 
which for the 20042005 school 
year had a 2.77 percent interest 
rate for students still in school, 
became 4.7 percent on July 1, 
according to Molly Seltzers 
Richmond.com article Rising 
rates pique interest. For gradu
ates repaying their loans, the in
terest rose from 3.37 percent for 
the 20042005 school year to 5.3 
percent for the 2005-2006 year.
Because PLUS loans are bor
rowed primarily by parents, re
payment begins 60 days after the 
second dispersement, not after 
graduation. The interest rate for 
.PLUS loans in the 2004-2005 
school year was 4.17 percent. In 
the 2005-2006 year, it is expected 
to peak at 6.1 percent.
Theyre [the federal govern
ment] raising this rate to keep for
eign spenders interested and the 
dollar strong, said Bonnie Lack, 
Director of Financial Aid at the 
Tepper School of Business. Refer
ring to the 2.77 percent interest 
rate, she said, We will never see 
that again.
However, Lack added that the 
interest rates are still fairly low 
for todays market. In addition, 
federal law stipulates that the 
interest rate of Federal Stafford 
loans can never go above a cer
tain level. The beauty of the Fed
eral Stafford Loan, Lack said, is 
that it can never go higher than 
8.25 percent.
Director of Enrollment Services 
Linda Anderson also stressed that 
interest rates were still favorable 
for students who wanted to bor
row. You really have to put it into 
perspective, she said. According 
to Anderson, Carnegie Mellon 
students are considered good
risks for federal loans, since they 
can generally find a career im
mediately after college and begin 
repayment. Its worth the invest
ment, said Anderson.
In order to minimize their pay
ments after graduation, students 
were urged to consolidate their 
loans before July 1, 2005, when 
the new interest rates went into 
effect. When a student chooses 
to consolidate their loans, the 
weighted average of the students 
interest rates is locked in as the 
new rate. Anderson explained that 
for students who consolidated be
fore June 30, 2005, the interest 
rate could have been as low as 
2.875 percent for the lifetime of 
the loan.
Anderson sent two letters to en
rolled students and recent gradu
ates in May 2005, explaining their 
options. One letter begins: As a 
recent graduate, in-grace loan 
consolidation can be the key to 
saving thousands of dollars over 
the life of a consolidation loan.
While consolidation is gener
ally considered a good option, 
Lack stressed that it might not 
be the best choice for everyone.

by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
Regular patrons of the food 
trucks on Tech Street will have 
to adjust their routine this fall. 
The six mobile food vendors that 
once lined Tech Street beside Posner Hall have been relocated to 
Margaret Morrison Street, across 
from the sororities.
Sarit Tasit, a vendor from the 
Thai Kitchen truck, said he heard 
rumors about the trucks reloca
tion a few months ago. Tasit also 
mentioned that representatives 
from both Carnegie Mellon and 
the City of Pittsburgh approached 
the vendors in early July to inform 
them of a future move.
According to Tasit, that was the 
last he heard about relocation un
til the vendors received a 
notice from the City of Pitts
burgh Department of Public 
Works on August 24. The 
notice read simply: As of 
August 17, 2005, new spots 
were designated. Please 
move to your new location 
on Margaret Morrison Street 
immediately.
The vendors remained in 
their Tech Street locations 
until August 26, when they 
received a second notice 
saying, Permitted location: 
Move by 3PM today to new 
location (Margaret Morrison) 
or citation will be written. All 
six vendors complied.
We had no choice, no 
chance, said Tasit.
They should have sent a let
ter to let us know the problem 
and give us more time to move, 
agreed Vrai Tasit, also a vendor 
with Thai Kitchen. First, its 
too far. And when the snow 
comes in the winter? Forget it. 
Well be dead in the winter.

New routes offer service to South Side
ROUTES, from A3
Summerset will follow the 61C 
route as far as Murray Avenue and 
Forward Avenue in Squirrel Hill 
before serving the new Summerset at Frick Park housing develop
ment. The 61F Homestead Park 
will follow the 61C route all the 
way to Homestead, before follow
ing the 53F route to Homestead 
Park.
Both of these routes will pro
vide service to students trying to 
reach Giant Eagle in Squirrel Hill, 
and the 61F will also serve those 
students who had used the old 
61C to get most of the way to the 
Waterfront.
The 64A, which also travels 
from Squirrel Hill to the Water
front, will no longer serve High
land Park or the Pittsburgh Zoo. 
It will discontinue most of its ser
vice to the Loews Cineplex at the 
Waterfront. Students who once 
took the 64A to Loews will now 
need to transfer to another bus, 
or else walk in order to get from 
stores at the Waterfront to the 
Loews theater.
Other routes for which stu

At an Army recruiting station in Oakland on August 20, police used pepper spray, Taser guns, and police dogs on 
the crowd after a protestor allegedly struck a freelance television cameraman. Protestors have since filed complaints with 
the Citizens Police Review Board (CPRB) claiming the police used excessive force.

INTEREST, from A3
We talked with our students in
dividually to see if it was right for 
[them], she said. For those who 
had borrowed subsidized money 
and were not being charged in
terest, consolidating loans would 
not be the best choice available. 
In addition, Lack mentioned that 
students are offered a six-month 
grace period once they graduate 
to prepare for their repayment 
of Federal Stafford loans. If they 
chose to consolidate their loans 
before July 1, they were required 
to forfeit that grace period.
Anderson agreed that consoli
dating loans might have resulted 
in the loss of certain borrower 
benefits but that the savings 
were very much worth it.
Both Lack and Anderson em
phasized the importance of stu
dents researching and exploring 
their financial options. According 
to Lack, loan counseling is espe
cially important for the Tepper 
School, as roughly 80 percent of 
Tepper students borrow some sort 
of loan. We do not just talk to our 
students about whats available, 
but we also do credit counseling 
for them, said Lack. Anderson 
added that students needed to be 
informed and educated about re
payment.
According to Anderson, Fed
eral Stafford Loan interest rates 
are projected to rise again in the 
2006-2007 year, to 5.24 percent 
for enrolled students and 5.84 for 
students in repayment. However, 
she said, Educational loans are 
still a worthwhile financial deci
sion. With interest rates still sig
nificantly low, borrowing really 
does make fiscal sense.

Academic Bill of Rights meets with skepticism
HOROWITZ, from A3
the canons of academic freedom, 
the adopted committee is only in
vestigating the public sector.
Executive Director Michael 
Finch of Horowitzs Center for the 
Study of Popular Culture was con
tacted, but The Tartan was told he 
was unavailable for comment.
As for whether the bill will ever 
fully find its way into law in Penn
sylvania, Carnegie Mellon Provost 
Mark Kamlet was doubtful. From 
my perspective, Kamlet said, 
thats good - its a set of positions 
that sound completely innocu
ous... but the way it seeks to im
plement what its trying to pursue 
could be very wrongheaded and 
dangerous.
Although Kamlet said his own 
opinions do not necessarily rep
resent those of other University 
administration, he did not en
dorse the bill, saying, It has not 
met with a very favorable recep
tion at all by most of the respon
sible groups that have dealt with 
it [such as the AAUP].
University President Jared Co
hen said that he personally agreed 
with Kamlet, and that the bill was 
a bad idea.
The basic idea that the cur
riculum and what gets taught are 
decided by the faculty and not by 
any external forces is absolutely 
fundamental to universities, Co
hen said. And anything that can 
set principle or work against it 
is something that I am very con
cerned about. While this bill and 
the committee that creates it can
not directly control or affect cur
riculum or course content, it is 
certainly a step in that direction 
and the very existence of it could 
have a chilling effect on faculty 
and their institutions.

Food trucks relocated from Tech 
Street to Margaret Morrison Street
TRUCKS, from A3
However, Associate Vice Presi
dent Michael Murphy cites sev
eral objectives in relocating the 
food vendors. The primary con
cerns with the old location were 
the proximity to the entrances 
to two major academic buildings 
and the congested nature of the 
Tech-Margaret Morrison inter
section, Murphy stated in an 
e-mail to The Tartan.
According to Murphy, the new 
location also increases proximity 
to residential and recreational 
areas and the UC, and it allowed
the university to place picnic ta
bles under the trees in front of the 
trucks for seating. The adjacency 
to Highlander, especially when it 
expands later this fall with fitness 
and other dining, will make this a 
nice hub.
Although Housing and Dining 
Services had no involvement in 
the decision, Director of Housing 
and Dining Services Tim Michael 
noted, We know that an issue 
with the trucks was the use of 
Gingers Deli in Posner for seat
ing after buying a truck meal. 
The number of seats in Gingers is 
small and the truck patrons often
took seats needed for Gingers 
regular customers.
Michael also mentioned the ex
panded dining area in Resnik that 
is to open in the spring that will 
provide ample seating for truck 
patrons.
One of the things I like about 
CMU is that they always listen to 
students opinions, and I feel in 
this instance there was just a lack 
of communication, said Katie 
Wallat, a senior Science and Hu
manities Scholar in biology and 
truck patron. Students werent

How Things Work:
Radioisotope thermoelectric generators
Science/^Technology
29 August 2005 THE TARTAN An
William Nicoll
When you imagine a deep-space 
probe, what do you see? A big metal 
box, a forest of antennas, and a pair 
of solar panels, right? Wrong. Con
trary to the stereotype, almost any 
probe traveling into space will not 
use solar panels as its power source. 
The energy from the sun at this dis
tance is simply too small. An alter
native is needed: something that is 
reliable, has a long-life, and is light
weight. What can we do? American 
engineers answered this very ques
tion in the early 1960s with the ra
dioisotope thermoelectric generator, 
or RTG.
RTGs work by converting the heat 
given off by a radioactive isotope into 
electricity. To understand this pro
cess, it helps to understand what a 
radioactive isotope is. One might say 
they are out of their element! (Hah.) 
Seriously though, they have extra 
neutrons. Such elements feel these 
neutrons are like annoying cousins: 
they want to get rid of them. In doing 
so, they become radioactive, releas
ing protons, neutrons, and energy in 
a process called decay. Eventually the 
isotope will turn into other elements 
and disappear.
At first glance, this might seem like 
the same process that takes place in 
nuclear reactors, but it isnt. Nuclear 
reactors generate heat by fission, 
a process in which atoms are split 
by a bombardment of neutrons. In 
an RTG, heat is generated only by 
the natural radioactive emissions of 
the isotope contained in it. This is a 
much slower process, but the advan
tage is its stability; it can never go out 
of control and melt down.
Another advantage of RTGs is that 
they contain no moving parts. This is
a high energy density. This is espe
cially important in space, when every 
gram of weight is at stake. The higher 
the energy density, the smaller the 
RTG can be.
Thirdly, the isotope should emit 
only alpha-type radiation. Alpha ra
diation is easily absorbed and can be 
stopped by as little as a sheet of pa
per. This means that it requires the 
least amount of shielding to protect 
people and the environment from 
ionizing radiation. Since shielding 
equals weight, the less the better. 
Some isotopes emit beta and gamma 
radiation, both of which are more 
penetrating than alpha particles. 
This makes such isotopes less than 
ideal candidates, even if they have 
good energy output.
With these principles in mind, a 
continuous, reliable source of en
ergy can be created that will last for 
decades. The Voyager 1 and 2 satel
lites, which were launched in 1977, 
were only designed to operate for 
five years. Their RTGs, however, have 
been running for 28 years and are 
projected to run for many more.
Engineers have realized this kind of 
potential, and they have not limited 
the use of RTGs to the outer reaches 
of space. Many RTGs have been used 
to power remote lighthouses, buoys, 
and other hard to reach places. There 
were even tiny RTGs made to power 
pacemakers, but unfortunately, these 
plutonium-powered models never 
caught on.
Nevertheless, NASA and the De
partment of Energy continue to im
prove the design of current RTGs and 
find new applications. Who knows? 
Someday we might have RTGs power
ing our MP3 players and cell phones. 
Just make sure to slip them in your 
lead-lined pants pocket!

Chimpanzees conform to 
their fellows practices
Like humans, chimpanzees are motivated 
by the desire to do things like their peers and 
fit in to societal groups, according to research
ers at St. Andrews University. A high-ranking 
member of one group of chimps was taught 
to operate a feeding mechanism by poking an 
obstacle with a stick. Other members of the 
group soon adopted the same technique.
In another group, the high-ranking chimp 
was taught to lift the obstacle with a stick, rath
er than poking it aside. Other members of that 
group quickly adopted the lifting technique.
Members of a control group, which had 
no expert, were unable to bypass the ob
stacle and access their food. Initially, the 
chimps in the first two groups stuck with the 
behaviors they learned from their local ex
perts, but eventually some members of the 
poking group learned the lifting technique, 
and their peers soon followed. However, 
after the feeding mechanisms were taken 
away for two months and then reintroduced, 
each group used only its original method. 
Control group chimps never learned either 
technique.
These results suggest that, although know
ing two different methods, chimps will choose 
to conform their practices to others for soci
etal benefits rather than material ones.

Brilliant Renaissance art is 
found to contain glass
Paintings by Renaissance-era Venetian art
ists have long been renowned for their bril
liance, and a senior scientist at the National 
Gallery of Art has discovered why: tiny piec
es of glass embedded in the paint. Using an 
electron microscope, Barbara Berrie found 
rounded pieces of glass just thousandths of an 
inch thick in paintings by Lorenzo Lotto. Ber
rie thought of the technique after scanning 
historical tax records and wills. She noticed 
that some inventories contained pigments 
with glass in them, and theorized that the 
painters and masters of glass and ceramics 
in Venice were probably experimenting with 
new ingredients, purchased from apothecar
ies or made on their own. Berrie also found 
evidence that Venetian artists would trade or 
share their successful ideas and techniques 
with each other, enabling Venice to develop 
a dye and pigment market about a century 
before cities in the rest of Europe.

NASA finds that liquid water 
still flows on Mars
Some gullies on the surface of Mars were 
created by water that flowed recently on the 
surface of the planet, according to a new 
study by NASA scientists. In the past, numer
ous studies have found that water created 
gullies on Mars, but in all previous cases the 
gullies were ancient. The new research, aid
ed by computer modeling, indicates that wa
ter trapped just under ground level may oc
casionally bubble up through the surface and 
flow for about 500 meters before it boils in 
Mars cold, thin atmosphere. Scientists have 
known for many years that water exists on 
Mars, but that most of it is frozen in the plan
ets polar regions and under the surface. Any 
future human presence on the planet would 
require a supply of liquid water for drinking 
and fuel.

Robotic spy-plane drones

A new type of robotic aircraft can change 
between a stable glider configuration and 
a super-maneuverable flier configuration 
by changing the shape of its wings in mid
flight. The new craft, developed by Univer
sity of Florida researchers to be used for for 
spy work, features joints in the middle of its 
wings and where the wings meet its fuselage. 
Using actuators at those joints, the planes 
can shape themselves like an M, allowing for 
a stable, low-power state, or a W, allowing a 
more maneuverable state, as needed.
According to Rick Lind, an engineer 
who worked on the robotic plane, the fea
tures of the 60-centimeter-wingspan drone 
cannot be scaled up to planes that could 
carry humans because of material strength 
limitations. Also, the small planes are 
designed to fly at relative
ly low speeds and are based on 
aerodynamic principles that are not well 
understood and do not apply at high speeds. 
The research team is now working on devel
oping a robust autopilot system for the craft.

beneficial because moving parts tend 
to break and wear out over time. 
RTGs make their electricity by using 
thermocouples. To understand how a 
thermocouple works, lets take a trip 
back to 1821 to the great country of 
Estonia. There, scientist Thomas Seebeck found that a temperature differ
ence between two dissimilar metals 
produces a voltage. Like a true scien
tists, he discovered this accidentally, 
and named the phenomenon after 
himself  the Seebeck effect.
The Seebeck effect is quite useful 
in an RTG. If one end of a thermo
couple is placed next to a hot radio
isotope and the other is connected to 
a heat sink in the cold, hostile void
of space, a temperature difference 
is created, providing a continuous 
source of energy limited only by the 
isotopes decay rate.
This brings up an important point: 
What isotopes are good candidates 
for powering an RTG? Firstly, a good 
isotope should decay at such a rate 
that it gives off a usable amount of 
heat, but does not decay so fast that 
it disappears quickly. The decay rate 
is measured by a factor called halflife, the time it takes for half of an 
isotopes mass to disappear (not the 
video game by Valve Software). The 
half-life for isotopes used in most 
RTGs is between 20 and 100 years.
Secondly, the isotope should have

a highly regulated module comprising 
a group of these neurons. The module, 
in turn, will help illuminate how specif

perfected, this approach of studying

Housing takes great leaps in improving student living
In the past, The Tartan has been very 
critical of housing and dining. Today, 
wed like to turn around and commend 
Housing and Dining Services for their 
summer efforts. Over the past three 
months, Housing has made some major 
improvements to campus.
CMU students have long complained 
about the lack of exercise facilities, the 
need for fresh coats of paint in their 
rooms, the degradation of housing ar
eas, and the difficulty of obtaining spe
cial interest housing spaces. This sum
mer, though, Housing has made positive 
steps toward rebuilding student living 
spaces and bringing them up to the stan
dards we expect from a top-tier univer
sity. Housing has spent millions of dol
lars renovating buildings on campus. 
With the departure of Delta Tau Delta 
and Delta Upsilon from the fraternity 
quad, Housing spent more than $1 mil
lion on renovations in each building. 
Donner, regarded by many as the ugliest 
building on campus, has had its carpet
ing replaced; the bathrooms gutted and 
enlarged; electronics upgraded; and stu
dent rooms refurbished.
Even more impressive are the four 
new fitness centers which were added 
to Morewood Gardens, Mudge, the Mar
garet Morrison Storefront lounge, and
Shady Oak. Finally, students cant be too 
lazy to walk to their exercise rooms. The 
irony.
But most importantly, with the ex
piration of the campus dining contract 
with Parkhurst Dining Services, Inc., 
looming in the near future, Housing and 
Dining Services have merged under Tim 
Michael. Skibo Coffeehouse is the first 
of many dining facilities on campus to be 
remodeled for a sleeker, more welcoming 
feel. In addition, the UCs Dining Gallery 
on the second floor has been remodeled 
and rearranged to allow for a better dis
play. We hope the food is as tasty as the 
remodeling is sexy.
The trucks move to Maggie Mo: Itll be okay, we promise
The trucks have moved. So whats the 
problem?
Its hard to walk around campus lately 
without getting a petition in your face 
about it. For students on campus, a 
number of them first-years who are new 
and confused, it must seem like a huge 
travesty has occurred. The trucks move 
needs to be kept in perspective.
There seem to be three main com
plaints: 1) that CFA students will no lon
ger have the time to get food from the 
trucks in the ten-minute gap between 
classes; 2) that moving the trucks from 
Tech Street to Margaret Morrison Street 
will cause the trucks to lose a significant 
amount of business; and 3) that parking
will be taken away from Margaret Mor
rison and will not be returned on Tech 
Street, as the city of Pittsburgh is reserv
ing that area for city vehicles.
But lets be realistic. We understand 
that the trucks were outside CFA and 
a great convenience for students, but 
theyre only being moved about 500 feet 
down the road  a one-minute walk 
away from their current location. The 
distance isnt significant. Walk the extra 
two minutes and work off some of that 
pad thai.
The most legitimate concern is the 
amount of business that vendors expect 
to lose. The managers of the trucks have 
said that they expect up to an 80 percent
drop in revenue as a result of the move, 
and students have agreed. In the end, 
though, its hard to imagine that the 
move will change the way campus will 
dine.
As far as parking is concerned, the 
construction of a new level to the park
ing lot will hopefully free up space for 
drivers without spots to park in. But we 
wont know for sure for some time.
Simply put, if we love the trucks as 
much as 'we say we do, well find a way 
to make it over to them. Theyre only 
moving a block away, so rather than 
fuss about the move, show your support, 
walk the extra block, and keep the trucks 
rollin.
Leave academic freedom to the academics
Conservative columnist David Horo
witz, who has been trying to push legis
lation on the national and state levels to 
protect conservative students from what 
he calls liberal bias, claimed a victory 
at the news of the Harrisburgs decision.
Liberals went on the offensive  
rightly so, but their approach has been 
ineffectual. Fortunately, the American 
Council on Education set out in the right 
direction when instead of lashing out 
with nonsense, they drafted the State
ment on Academic Rights and Responsi
bilities.
Horowitzs Academic Bill of Rights 
pushes some fairly innocuous ideas into 
dangerous territory with artful wordplay: 
curricula should reflect the uncertainty 
and unsettled character of all human 
knowledge by providing students 
with dissenting sources and viewpoints 
where appropriate. What you learn in 
school, the bill states, should welcome 
a diversity of approaches to unsettled 
questions. And, oh yes, speakers should
always promote intellectual pluralism 
as well. No problem.
But then, who decides what is 
appropriate? What dictates an 
unsettled question? And why have 
interesting speakers if they cant take 
strong stances on their beliefs? The gov
ernment should not have a hand in these 
matters.
However, Horowitzs bill is not a bla
tant quota-system mandate. Nowhere 
does it say that schools should employ as 
many conservative professors as liberal 
ones. Nor does it demand that political 
science classes split equally into blue and 
red  though certain interpretations 
could construe it that way. Too many ex
tremist liberals have flown off the handle 
and painted Horowitzs ramblings as 
quota-pushing, right-wing craziness, 
without addressing the bill for what it 
actually says. In doing so, as is too often 
the case, theyve opened themselves up 
-for easy conservative criticism.
To fend off state or national inter
vention in academia, opponents to 
Horowitzs bill need to pose intelligent 
arguments, not exaggerated claims that 
undercut their credibility.
The ACEs statement makes several 
of the same points as Horowitz, but 
specifically avoids any mandates that 
could be construed as quota-governing 
or viewpoint-pushing. It defends intel
lectual and political freedom openly, 
without hidden agendas: as it states in 
its first point, each school shapes its own 
particular purpose, and that purpose 
dictates its academic tone. Thirty differ
ent educational groups across the nation
 including the American Association of 
University Professors  have endorsed 
the ACEs statement. This shows that 
the academic community knows what it 
needs.
Its time for politicians to listen up. To 
conservatives, lay off; academia knows 
what it needs. And to liberals, rein in 
your sensationalism and follow the lead 
of those who know best.
Before using misc.market, 
(re) learn your netiquette
Meg Richards
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon, where 
every student had an e-mail address 
before most schools figured out what 
ARPANET was. For some first-years, 
coming to CMU opens doors to the 
unfamiliar world of newsgroups. For 
others, USENET is ________________
as old a hat as Lin
colns stovepipe.
In order to more 
speedily acclimate 
the former with 
these forums of 
theirs, and in order 
to refresh the latter 
(and some older 
readers), I present 
some fundamen
tals of netiquette.
First of all, what 
you do on AIM
and private zephyr is your business; 
what you post to emu.misc.market, 
the community bulletin board, and 
other public forums is everyones busi
ness. Its going to be there for a very 
long time, can be read by everyone 
you know (including potential profes
sors and bosses), and is a reflection of 
yourself out there in the faceless world 
of the Net. There are some simple rules 
you can follow to make sure people take 
you seriously and listen to what you 
have to say.
One of the easiest things to do is not 
use AIM-speak. Thats it. Do not pass 
go, do not collect $200. Youre well past 
middle school, and your correspondence 
should reflect that. U and ur are 
not acceptable substitutions for words
Im sorry this 
letter is so long, 
but I did not have 
time to write a 
shorter one.
that are only three and five letters, re
spectively. You can kiss L8r goodbye, 
too. An equally obnoxious habit is TO 
WRITE IN ALL CAPITALS FOR LONG 
SENTENCES. This is the e-mail equiva
lent of shouting and should be used 
sparingly. A preferred method of add
ing emphasis would be like *this* or 
_this_. When you respond to an e-mail 
and you plan to address a previous post,
________________ delineate any direct
quotes you use with 
something like *>. 
For example:
> Did you hear
> they got new
> G5s in the
> Wean intro
> cluster?
Yeah, they're 
awesome.
For the threaded 
argument style that 
emu.misc.market 
so dearly embraces, 
subject lines are crucial. E-mails with 
the subject FREE SEX and a body that 
starts out ...Now that Ive got your at
tention havent been funny since 1993. 
An informative and accurate subject 
line will get you far. Not only is the 
original subject important, but also fol
low-ups should adhere to Re: Original 
Subject unless they take an extreme 
tangent that is somehow related to the 
original message, in which case the for
mat becomes New Subject (was Re: 
Old Subject). The coundess misc.mar
ket readers who browse by subject will 
be very grateful.
To all those who insist on posting 
blank e-mails with the subject test,

Student life at CMU should 
go beyond the classroom
Benjamin Hackett
New faces, innovative talents, and 
fresh meat, welcome to Carnegie 
Mellon. Inherent in your enrollment 
and payment of tuition is an unwritten 
bill of rights afforded to you upon 
joining the Carnegie community. 
First-years are subdued for weeks with 
undiversified talks of diversity, laced ice 
cream sundaes and merrymaking under 
the guise of Playfair and related activi
ties. Yet, all the joyous revelry aside, has 
the conversation been had that informs 
you of where the loopholes, enjoyable 
avenues, and special spaces hide?
Let one who has fallen down in the 
path to self-realization offer a map so 
that you may avoid similar pitfalls. It 
would be a most grievous error for you 
to be unable to look back four to five 
years from now without a smile com
ing to your face. However, this is not 
a simple task. Many students arrive in 
their upperclassman years jaded and 
longing for May to arrive as quickly as 
possible. Waiting to exit is not proper 
exit strategy.
Recognizing your talents is one of the 
great gifts college is intended to bring. 
Perhaps in high school, the jack-of-alltrades mentality got you through the 
day, and perchance even into college. 
The university setting is designed, or 
at least classically intended, to provide 
you with an accessible environment 
for determining your true interest and 
skills. If you prefer languages to math
ematics, stop pretending, and embrace 
what you are driven toward. Simply be
cause your father worked on Wall Street
does not mean that you are required to 
stay in Tepper when your heart is really 
in CFA. Many of those who are unhappy 
fall into that frightful rut by denying 
their true interests and falling out of the 
realm of intellectual honesty. There are 
countless examples of students finding 
their niche and going on to be great 
successes in fields they would have pre
viously never considered.
Socially, expansion and network
ing should become prominent in 
your repertoire. Remember to never 
be too comfortable in a social circle. 
While good friends are wonderful and 
necessary for support, never pigeonhole 
yourself into a role. Once you decide to 
make yourself exclusive to a group or 
a specific social type, a great opportu
nity for development is lost. Writing 
off a person or many due to prejudice 
or predetermined thought inevitably 
comes back to haunt you later on in 
an academic career. Specifically, it can 
honestly be said that limiting oneself to 
a tight circle stifles diversity of thought. 
It certainly is not beneficial in the least 
when the lessons learned in university 
require application in a professional 
setting.
Use the University, because the 
University uses you as well. Many 
may not enjoy their classes, but that 
alone is not an excuse to write off the 
faculty. The faculty, especially here, at 
prestigious Carnegie Mellon University, 
is rich with a lifes bounty of experience 
and academic trendsetting. At $40,000 
a year, you should strive to take as much 
away from CMU as you put in. There are 
ample expanses available, and once in
tellectual honesty is achieved, there are

whole sets of students and fac
ulty with similar interests with 
whom one should collaborate 
to pursue interests of ones own. 
Whether you want to work on 
Middle Eastern foreign policy or 
build unmanned military vehi
cles, there is someone else here 
that shares your interests.
Venturing into Pittsburgh 
proper is key: Never settle to live 
your Carnegie community life 
only on and near campus. This 
is a very decent city, rich with 
venues and libation factories. 
Live music and theater can be 
found at every turn. There are 
activities on campus that are 
excellent, but make sure to hop 
on that bus and venture around. 
One will find that interaction in 
the community will aid in keep
ing proper perspective when in
side the CMU bubble.
Lessons learned over the 
years compel this advice. Re
member through your time here
to be ever expanding intellectu
ally and socially. A great danger 
of finally being on your own is 
falling into the trap on exclusiv
ity and close-minded thought. 
There will always be events 
that rile, up the populace, and 
at times one might find oneself 
attached to a number of activist
causes. Exercise your newfound 
freedoms, and always speak 
up when something is on your 
mind. Never falter, and never 
allow others to impede your
personal progress. Welcome to 
Carnegie Mellon; this is now 
your school.

the real one. If it goes through, 
youll know, and if it doesnt, dig 
the message out of your sent mail

message proxies take up valuable 
room on my 12.1" screen and are 
easily avoidable.
For the few and the brave that 
attempt to use misc.market to ac
tually sell or buy anything, here 
are some useful pointers. First, 
the acronyms: WTB: is Want to 
Buy and FS: is For Sale. Rudi
mentary, but important. If you in
tend to respond to one of these emails, scroll through the posts af
ter it first. Many people follow up 
their FS: or WTB: with a post say
ing if the item was sold or bought. 
When you do respond to one of
these e-mails, make sure it sends 
only to the seller or buyer and not 
the whole misc.market world. No 
one cares that you want to buy Joe 
Quarks physics textbook. Also, 
to all potential sellers out there, 
condense your posts! If selling 
everything you own, put it in one 
e-mail with a subject that says so. 
Scrolling through 30 e-mails from 
the same person all advertising 
one item each is the leading cause 
of premature gray hair.
Thats the syntax of effective 
electronic communication. Now 
for the style.
Never, ever, forward a pri
vate e-mail to another person or 
newsgroup without the original 
senders permission. There are 
very few reasons to break this 
rule, and hopefully you will never 
experience any of them. Also, 
ad hominem attacks are not kosher. Contradicting someones 
lucid, well-constructed argument 
with Youre so dumb will get 
you about as far as an ant on a 
treadmill.
Concise arguments are a sign of 
good argument style. Mark Twain 
is said to have written, Im sorry 
this letter is so long, but I did not 
have time to write a shorter one. 
If every person took the time to 
say in two sentences what he or 
she said in three paragraphs, 
world peace would be exponen
tially closer.
Finally, if you take away only 
one thing from this piece, take 
this: Think before you post.
Meg Richards (merichar@J is a

affect smaller groups of stu
dents, of which many on campus 
might not be aware. As hard as 
student government may work, 
there never seems to be enough 
time to solve every problem that 
may arise; however, if we, as 
one community, focus our atten
tion to what needs to be done on 
campus, the student body as a 
whole will be a lot more effective 
in making changes.
Student government strives to 
work harder in understanding 
the needs of the students, as well 
as communicating those needs to 
the decision-making bodies on 
campus. We encourage you, the 
student body, to bring your issues 
and your concerns forward, as 
there is no way your concerns can 
make it to Student Government 
discussion otherwise.
No effective student adminis
tration can make changes without the support of the student 
body. This year, I would like to 
see students take a vested interest 
in our campus. Do not simply file 
complaints and wait for changes 
to occur; instead, figure out 
where you and your talents can 
be helpful, then focus your en
ergy there. We need to know what 
changes must be made; but, more 
importantly, we need more peo
ple to become involved for those 
changes to happen. Everyone has 
a necessary role on this campus: 
Some people are great organiz
ers, some are great motivators, 
some are great supporters, and 
others have great networking 
skills. Regardless of what your 
role may be, we need everyone 
to realize that they are important 
and useful to the student body. 
This is the only way we can get 
things done.
This year, Tom and I are mak
ing a special request to the mem
bers of this campus: Get involved. 
Getting involved doesnt require 
joining ten clubs and spending 
all of your free time in meetings. 
What we need are individuals 
who will not simply complain 
about a problem, but will take the 
next steps in remedying it. Com
municate your concerns to people 
who can help make a change, see 
where you can help in solving 
the problem, and stay focused 
until something happens. Tom 
and I know that we cant make a 
difference on this campus alone. 
There is so much potential here at 
CMU that we know great things 
can happen under our leader
ship. The greatest resource this 
campus has is its students, so we 
need to harness that energy as 
best we can.
On our end, there are a few 
initiatives that Tom and I would
like to start over the next few 
months. There are a few com
mittees which we would like 
to form on the issues of diver
sity and communication. For 
example, I am in the process of 
bringing back the defunct Mul
ticultural Council, which would 
allow various organizations to 
network and collaborate in an 
effort to make those groups more 
of an asset to the community. 
We would also like to develop 
a communications task force by 
late September with the objective 
of looking at the communication 
concerns on campus (advertising 
student organization events, etc.) 
and determining a better way to 
look at untapped communication 
resources for students. Both of 
these committees respond to the 
issues weve heard from student 
organizations regarding event 
attendance and event planning.
If you are interested in taking 
part on any level, please be sure 
to contact us.
Before I close, I would like to 
welcome everyone back! I hope 
you all had a great summer. 
While we get back into gear with 
classes and get reaccustomed to 
the daily grind, I hope everyone 
remembers just how much we 
can get accomplished this year. 
Always feel free to contact Tom 
or me with any questions, com
ments, or concerns; were count
ing on it.
Be careful what you set your 
heart upon  for it will surely be 
yours.

Summer Sports Roundup
ROUNDUP, from A16
of the many questions that have 
come up during this offseason, 
and, as usual, the preseason has 
done little to answer them.
What we do know so far is 
that number-one draft pick 
Alex Smith of San Francisco 
is far from ready to take over 
an NFL team, and you might 
be able to say the same about 
Eli Manning with the Giants. 
.The Steelers need to sign Hines 
Ward as quickly as possible to 
give Ben Roethlisberger a famil
iar and reliable target to throw 
to. Randy Moss will be more 
than worth the drama he causes 
as always, even if he smokes 
a little weed. And once again, 
the NFC looks like a crapshoot, 
with the Eagles and possibly the 
Falcons looking like the only 
playoff locks right now.
A few bold predictions for 
the upcoming season: The
Titans first round pick, Adam 
Pac-Man Jones, will set new 
rookie records for both number 
of posse members and number of 
times being arrested. The Eagles 
Terrell Owens will increase his 
holdout demands by threatening 
to defect to the Canadian Football 
League, a threat he will quickly 
rescind upon learning about 
Canada. The Chicago Bears will 
use eight starting quarterbacks 
in the course of the season, 
including Ryan Leaf, Jeff 
George, and Kordell Stewart, 
who will go a combined 1-15. 
Finally, the New England Patriots 
will again lose to the Steelers 
in the regular season... but will 
again dominate Pittsburgh in 
the playoffs.
The Yankees cant beat the 
Devil Rays: As a Red Sox fan, Ill 
take the high road on this one. 
All I have to point out is a simple 
statistic  the Yankees record 
versus the historically awful 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays: four 
wins, nine losses, .307 winning 
percentage (WP). Im not saying 
anything bad about the Yanks; 
Im saying that good baseball 
teams beat the Devil Rays. In 
fact, the Pittsburgh Pirates ver
sus the D-Rays this year: two
wins, one loss, .667 WP.
Speaking of the Pirates, they 
gave Pittsburgh a ray of hope 
by climbing to a .500 record in 
the middle of June by beating 
Tampa Bay, and then promptly 
began losing games the way 
fans have become used to. Miles 
away from a playoff race, theyve 
given their youngsters control of 
the team  and they havent 
disappointed. Jason Bay has 
been the teams MVP and is on 
pace for a 30-home-run season. 
Jack Wilson, despite awful num
bers at the plate, has been play
ing spectacular defense. Rookie 
pitcher Zach Duke is baffling 
hitters and putting the team on 
SportsCenter with every start. 
First-year players Chris Duffy, 
Ryan Doumit, Brad Eldred, and 
Ian Snell have all shown signs 
that they could lead this club 
back to the playoffs in time.
The biggest story in base
ball now has to be the battle 
for the American League Wild 
Card. The Athletics, Indians, 
and Yankees are all battling 
for the spot with almost identi
cal records. In the case of the 
Athletics and Yankees, both 
teams are within striking dis
tance of winning their divisions 
and sending either the Red Sox 
or Angels into the race.
Around the rest of the 
league, the status quo has 
shifted considerably. The White 
Sox have put up the best record 
in the American League behind 
what may be the leagues best 
starters. The Braves remain 
on top of the NL East despite 
fielding a lineup that occasion
ally features seven rookies. And 
the Padres control the NL West 
division with a sub-.500 record.
So while there have been a 
few major events in sports this 
summer, the most interesting 
ones have been those that havent 
made the front page of a paper. 
With the Penguins looking like a 
playoff team, the Steelers ready 
to open the season, and even 
an NBA preseasdh game coming 
to Pittsburgh, it looks like itll 
be a good semester for sports 
in the 'Burgh. Heres looking 
forward to a fall of great games 
and cheap beers.

The Lost Pride of Carnegie
by Tom Matta
Staffwriter
Imagine that you are a firstyear again, coming out of orien
tation andinto that pivotal first 
week of classes. Do you remember 
the change after the first week? 
Suddenly, your orientation friend 
only talks about how much work 
she has and how its impossible 
for anyone to understand her 
anguish. After just a few days, no 
one seems too excited to be here.
In my first year, I asked the 
older students countless times: 
What do you think of Carnegie 
Mellon? I heard every answer 
in the book, and the major
ity of them started with Ehhhh, 
well... and ended with some
thing about the quality of their 
degree.
I do, though, remember one 
girl in particular whose response 
shocked me. She exclaimed, I 
LOVE IT! with a sparkle in her 
eye and a grin from ear to ear. 
Why dont more students feel that 
way about our school and the 
college years that we dreamed of 
ever since junior high?
This disease has manifested 
itself in many aspects of the 
Carnegie Mellon community. One 
of-the subgroups that is signifi
cantly affected is our varsity, and 
club athletic teams.
The support for our teams in 
past years has been sparse, to say 
the least. The Athletics Council 
(AC) was founded by a small 
group of undergraduate students 
who wanted to bring more aware
ness and recognition to Carnegie 
Mellons athletic community. Its 
first project was to make a contri
bution toward Homecoming, an 
event in October that is the high
light of the year for many schools 
but often slips unnoticed through 
the fingers of our own student 
body. The success of their Chili 
Cook-off lent to the creation of 
two other events, including their 
annual arm wrestling competi
tion, the Guns of Carnegie, that 
catered to students throughout 
the course of the year.
Their advisor in Student 
Activities was amazed at the 
results after only one year in
existence. What was it that made 
this first year for the organization 
such a success? How was it able 
to raise spirit where it seemed 
like few people had cared?
It was not apparently obvious; 
countless organizations have 
held barbeques and giveaways in 
much the same manner. The AC 
had the same flyers, cheesy eye
catching jokes, and venues as pre
vious groups. In this case though, 
the object being sold or more or 
less given away was pride.
The AC offered a chance for stu
dents to step away from the tedi
um of Carnegie Mellon and into 
the lives and mentality of another 
community seen mostly at big
ger schools  a chance to taste 
the bond that is built between a 
group of men and women as they 
sweat together for nothing more 
than glory. This pride can attract 
all manner of organizations.
This brings us to the root of the 
issue: There is no lack of pride 
within Carnegie Mellon, but it is 
organized into departments. We 
all are guilty of this narrow sense 
of pride: academic departments, 
fine arts organizations, social 
organizations, Greek organiza
tions, and our athletic teams. It is 
much easier to wall off those indi
viduals who do not understand 
what drives us.
Last year a first-year asked me, 
Why are you on a sports team? 
I tried to explain how I love my 
sport and representing Carnegie 
Mellon in intercollegiate compe
tition. I found it very difficult to 
express the feeling of pride in 
words. But if you talk to someone 
who tried the Womens Basketball 
Chili as they sang the Chili Song 
they wrote for Homecoming, 
youre talking to someone who 
was eating more than beef and 
beans. He also got a taste of their 
pride. At Carnegie Mellon, this 
experience is too often isolated 
between different groups.
The doors need to be opened 
into the compartments that exist 
within our University. Last year I 
saw a few posters on campus for a 
script reading of the popular 90s 
movie The Goonies. As a huge fan,
I got a group of friends together 
and headed over to Purnell. As I 
walked in I found out there was a
Competitors battle in last years Guns of Carnegie arm wrestling event.
$7 entrance fee, while I watched 
the drama students in front of 
me walk right in. While they did 
let me in for $3.25, I was torn. 
How many students turned away 
because of that innocent request 
for a donation?
As a person involved in cre
ating a student organization, I 
understand limited budgets 
and the urge to raise funds 
whenever possible. The challenge 
to us, then, is to take the door off 
its hinges and share our pride 
with as many people as possible
 for free. If that happened, wed 
be amazed at the support.
I would like to encourage the 
Greek organizations to follow the 
same path. There is a pride inher
ent in the Greek system that is 
second to none, but many of the 
brothers and sisters of our fra
ternities and sororities are wor
ried. They are worried that the 
Greek system at Carnegie Mellon 
is being phased out. Nonetheless, 
work must be done to end the 
inter-house squabbling in order 
to support the university on a 
united front and gain support 
from the university. How many 
houses have had a formal dinner 
event followed by the symphony 
at CFA? How many houses have 
attended a sporting event with 
noisemakers and cowbells  and 
not just because one of the girls 
is on the pudding wrestling team
for its rush events each year? If 
fraternities and sororities can 
come together to do this, they 
will become invaluable to the 
University, and the University will 
reward them with respect.
All that is needed to achieve 
these goals are leaders who will 
stand up for the greater potential 
of Carnegie Mellon. A support 
structure already exists for the 
creation and implementation of 
programs. If Student Activities 
sees that you are willing to give 
a project your supreme effort, it 
will fund and support you to 
the end. Through our lack of 
involvement we leave them with 
no choice but to hire the same 
entertainment crew back again 
and again while they search for 
something original.
Be creative.' Hold an arm-wres
tling competition because no one 
believes it will work. Maybe only 
the football team will show up, 
but perhaps a random student 
walking through will stop and 
participate. Maybe this student 
will rack up a winning streak, 
and the audience will cheer Go 
Underarmour! because no one 
knows his name. The Guns of 
Carnegie was for students like 
him. Ask him what he thinks of 
Carnegie Mellon.

the biggest implications of this 
event were environmental. Even 
recently, no one would have 
dreamt of having any kind of fish
ing on the iiber-polluted Three 
Rivers. Now, thanks to the efforts 
of the City of Pittsburgh, our riv
ers are healthy again, shown not 
only by the number of bass in the 
water, but also by the indicator 
species  mayflies, algae, etc.
 that prove these rivers are 
clean enough for humans .
How does this help students? 
Well, unless youve got a boat, you 
probably dont care that much. 
However, businesses on the riv
ers now offer kayak and canoe 
rentals, giving people a new way 
to experience the city and at the 
very least, a decent alternative to 
sitting around and doing nothing 
on a hot Saturday in the city.
than his basketball resume. The 
Clippers passed on at least five 
solid NBA rookies for a Russian 
guy named Yaroslav. In between 
that, the Magic picked a Spanish 
guy named Fran, who refuses to 
play in America.
With all the garbage in the 
early part of the round, estab
lished teams like the Pacers, Nets, 
Celtics, and Grizzlies were able 
to pick up prospects who will 
contribute to their teams, such 
as Hakim Warrick and Gerald 
Green. Even more surprising was 
the talent in the second round, 
when established NCAA players 
Ryan Gomes, Lawrence Roberts, 
and the injured but still talented 
Ronny Turiaf were all selected.
After the draft, major NBA 
franchises like the Lakers, Knicks, 
and Celtics all decided to con
tinue to be mediocre with either 
puzzling or boring free-agent 
signings. The Knicks brought in 
Larry Brown to coach their team 
of shooting guards and under
sized power forwards; the Lakers 
traded away a solid starter (Caron 
Butler) for a head-case high 
school center (Kwame Brown); 
and the Celtics traded Antoine 
Walker to bring in three white 
guys, one of whom is nicknamed 
Veal.
So what was good about 
this offseason? The Eastern 
Conference got considerably 
stronger, with the Bucks, Cavs, 
and Heat all making significant 
upgrades to their rosters. The
focus appears to be solidifying its 
defense while letting the young 
players fire away on offense and 
learn from the veterans. While 
still not a championship team, 
this is a solid core of players who 
should make this team playoffbound for the first time since the 
2000-01 season.
A few questions remain, how
ever: Can former number one 
pick Marc-Andre Fleury turn 
into the game-changing goalie 
hes slated to become? Can local 
product Ryan Malone follow up 
on a successful rookie season and 
become a strong secondor thirdline center? Will Mario Lemieux 
still be effective at the age of 39? 
And, most importantly, will the 
Penguins still have Student Rush 
tickets, which allowed fans with 
student IDs to purchase the best 
available seats for a game for only 
$20? Only time will tell.
Since we last published in 
May, there have'been some major 
events in the world of sports. 
Lance Armstrong won his sev
enth Tour de France, steroids 
became an even better excuse to 
taunt Rafael Palmeiro than his 
Viagra commercials, and the 
Milwaukee Bucks drafted the 
next great Australian-Croatian 
center, Andrew Bogut. Of course 
with your internship in Beijing, 
you probably missed a lot of the 
little things that could have a 
major impact in the sports world 
for years to come.
The NHL returns to Pitts
burgh: Before July 22, there were 
only rumblings. The NHL was 
coming back, but no one in the 
Burgh seemed even the least bit 
interested. And then it happened. 
With an 8.3 percent chance, the 
Penguins won the NHL Draft 
Lottery, securing them the rights 
to draft Canadian phenom Sidney 
Crosby. Crosby, only 18 years old, 
is what some might call kind of a 
big deal. Even high school girls 
in Rhode Island know who he 
is, and hell look to take over as 
the new face of Mario Lemieuxs 
franchise.
Sparked by this superstar 
potential, the normally, uh, frugal 
Pens have made a big splash in 
the free agent market, surround
ing their young guns with proven 
veterans like Sergei Gonchar, 
Ziggy Palffy, John LeClair, and 
Jocelyn Thibault. The teams new
The NBA draft and free 
agency: After the Spurs won 
what was an essentially boring 
NBA Finals, the NBA draft turned 
out to be the more exciting event 
of the summer. In what may pan 
out to be the deepest draft of the 
past 25 years, experts everywhere 
were able to predict the top five 
to ten picks... and then nothing 
after that. The Knicks traded away 
their only rebounding big man 
(Kurt Thomas) for a center who 
was never that good in college 
and is as intimidating as a teddy 
bear (Channing Frye). The Lakers 
drafted a seven-foot-tall 17-yearold with a bigger MySpace profile
The Bassmaster Classic 
comes to the Three Rivers:
Granted, its not much of a main
stream event, but it brought 
some much-needed tourism and 
publicity to a city facing finan
cial crisis. The fishing tour
nament brought some truly 
unique characters to the Steel 
City and helped bolster the 
idea that Pittsburgh is a fishing 
burgh. If nothing else, city resi
dents were treated to impressive 
displays of outdoor life that most 
yinzers could enjoy.
But for most normal people,

GWAR, Strapping Young Lad; all are set to rock, and Im going. But first, a latte to 
soothe my nerves.
If youre not from the Midwest, like me, these thunderstorms add a little spice to your 
life, to be sure. But who cares? Cleveland knows how to throw a party, and its worth 
the drive. If you havent been, the Scene Pavilion is itself worth the visit. With the sky
line as a backdrop, and a heavily anticipated set by Chimaira, the city is every metal 
fans dream today. Culled from the cream of metals best underground offerings, 
this tour has set out to showcase all that is right within our scene. (And egg throwing 
is not one of those things. Shame on you, Ozzfest  more on that next time.)
One of the things that strikes me upon entering the stadium, besides the de-rigeur 
piercings and tats, is how young everybody looked. Yes, there are a few extended 
tummies and thinning manes to be spotted (not mine, of course). But, for every 
threadbare 86 World Devastation T-shirt, there are five or six goth girls or 
metalcore kids.
Clever slogans abound, my fave being Keep staring, I might do a trick. (Note to 
self: Gotta get me onea dem shirts.) Veering left, and right by the merch tables is 
a PETA booth. One might think that tabling in a meat-and-potatoes town like this 
would result in a few bonfires started, but no. In fact, proud farmers mingle with the 
hardcore crowd, politely accepting DVDs and pamphlets.
The lack of ego is also apparent in how the bands greet their fans before going on. 
Whether hanging out at the merch tables or the autograph booths, each band-dude 
I see is surrounded by kids clutching a disc or poster to get signed. After scribbling 
their names, the guys hang around and chat with their fans as if theyd known them 
for years. (Some have, actually.)
Hanging out at their table is Throwdowns Dom Macaluso (bass), my interviewee for 
the day. Dom and I head back out to the trucks and into their U-Haul to talk about 
their new album, Vendetta, among other things. If you havent checked it out yet,
Vendetta is -unique among their m-core peers. Pummeling breakdowns are every
where, completed by a solid rhythm section. Setting them apart is their spirit, for 
lack of a better word.
A communications major, Dom has a clear vision of where he sees the band among its 
peers. Keeping the group of metal bands tight is important to them, as is spreading 
their straight-edge message of no meat and no alcohol. But they still do respect their 
fans who chow down on meat and drink for a living: We love all our fans, of course, 
said Dom. Like today, I had a guy come out and scream out THHHHHHRRROWWD 
OOOWNNNNN!, all while spilling his beer on me! Its definitely something we want 
to do, introduce people to our way of thought, but we dont push it on anyone.
[Same with] religion.... If you look at the cover, there are layers of symbolism there. 
For example, you may notice the rosary beads, but might not catch the fact that the 
guy holding them is missing a part of his pinkie.... You know, I spent time in school 
studying how to communicate with people; I did that to make my mom proud. Now, 
Im [taking that and] doing what I love, which is spreading this music to our fans.
Guys like Dom make me proud of my scene, and yes, it is something we all own. Shows 
like the one today, with the mighty GWAR providing some much-needed relief dur
ing an intermission and Opeth sharing its operatic metal with jam-oriented Clutch 
fans, bring the tribes together like few festivals can. Cant wait until next year!
Until next time (when I review Ozzfest),

Mega movies in McConomy
Summer releases you can catch for a buck
War of the Worlds
In what is definitely one of Steven Spielbergs darkest films, War of the Worlds lets us watch as Martian forces invade 
Earth and systematically eradicate the human race. The visual feel of the movie is far more interesting than its 
characters are, and Spielberg works in scene after scene of unsettling and sometimes downright disturbing imagery
 dozens of corpses flowing down a river, people being vaporized in the streets of Newark, human blood turned into 
an aerosol fertilizer, Martian war machines, and massive tripods that Spielberg kept under wraps until opening night. 
Dakota Fanning and Tom Cruise are both pretty believable, but as with many Spielberg films, the real stars are the 
effects. Quite the stars they are, though, because War of the Worlds is by far one of the most unsettling alien invasion 
films in recent years.
Jennie Keinard/Art Staff
Its fall semester, and you know what that means: cheap 
summer movies replayed in McConomy Auditorium! 
However, instead of spending my summer money on 
worthwhile, spend-sawy items, I decided to go all out 
and see as many summer movies as I could. These movies 
will probably be showing up in the University Center 
this semester, at the bargain price of one dollar each. So 
be sure to check out Pillbox each week for $ movie, a 
feature in which we preview the films that will be showing 
in the upcoming week.
Land of the Dead
The lesson of George A. Romeros newest undead flick is 
that Pittsburgh is a safe bastion for humanity in case of 
zombie apocalypse. Land of the Dead follows the story 
set forth in Dawn of the Dead, in which zombies rise and 
wreak havoc across the nation. In this installment of the 
series, the zombies begin to learn and problem-solve in 
order to gain access to the high-class human settlement 
in what we know as downtown Pittsburgh. While the 
movie is obviously a zombie movie, its nice to see familiar 
locations; and comfortingly enough, the films moral ends 
up along the lines of zombies are people too.
Crash
Crash is a film about the desperation and loneliness that 
urban America creates in those who dwell within it. 
Starring Oscar nominee and all-around really cool guy 
Don Cheadle, as well as a metric ton of other famous faces 
(including Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, 
Rosario Dawson, Ryan Phillipe, and even Ludacris), the 
movie follows six main sets of characters as their lives 
intertwine. Crash would generally be classified as an arty 
sort of film, but its also one of those movies that will 
leave you thinking about it long after the movie ends. Its 
powerful and will make a good date movie  if you both 
like depressing, arty flicks.
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
Lets be honest, anyone who hasnt seen Revenge of the 
Sith yet probably doesnt care about seeing it. However, 
it was one of the biggest movies of the summer, and 
it was certainly the best movie in the new Star Wars 
trilogy. Unfortunately, the lovely Natalie Portman was 
Sith's acting low point  simply because her role wasnt 
important enough and George Lucas couldnt write a 
script to save a puppy. The effects and action scenes were 
great, though, even if Darth Vader totally loses any of the 
evil gravitas he once held. Nevertheless, expect this one 
to make a big splash when it comes to McConomy this fall
 we do go to Carnegie Mellon, after all.
The 40-Year-01d Virgin
The last great summer movie sounded like it was going to 
be terrible. A movie about a forty-year-old virgin? you 
say. Itll probably be another gross-me-out waste of time 
like all those Farrelly Brothers movies. Oh, how wrong 
you are. Steve Carell, best known as Brick Tamland from 
Anchorman and from The Daily Show with John Stewart, 
plays a 40-year-old virgin so believably that the movie 
has an intense sense of reality. There are plenty of gross 
gags and abrasive banter, but its all really freaking 
funny. Plus, gut instinct says that many Carnegie Mellon 
students will appreciate this movie more than standard 
theater audiences.
The Interpreter
Nicole Kidman gets to exercise her wonderful accent in The 
Interpreter, in which she plays a translator for the UN who 
stumbles upon a plot to destabilize the already unstable 
regime in a fictitious and embattled African country. Sean 
Penn takes her case as the prototypical burnt-out FBI 
agent with a haunted past, and becomes the father figure 
she never had. Although the film is extremely formulaic, 
its an enjoyable watch, and Nicole Kidman is totally hot 
with the sultry librarian look. The film is composed nicely, 
too, with good use of tension through camerawork and 
musical cues  and its certainly worth a dollar on a slow 
Thursday night.
4*ucc;-eo dv P4y4kl d557o

---------------------------------------------------

Mr. and Mrs. Smith
Most men can admit that Brad Pitt is as hot as fresh pancakes 
and not feel weird about it. Hes just that cool. In Mr. and 
Mrs. Smith, he and Angelina Jolie are a married couple who 
are also both spies, unbeknownst to each other. The movie 
progresses at an enjoyable pace, with the entire second half of 
the film becoming an extended action sequence. Mr. and Mrs. 
Smith is totally and happily devoid of any sort of substance, 
but you get to see attractive people blowing things up. Whos 
really going to complain?
March of the Penguins
This is a movie about penguins. Lets reiterate this: Its a 
movie about penguins! The documentary was made by a 
French film crew chronicling the mating cycle of emperor 
penguins in Antarctica. Theres really nothing bad to say 
about this movie, though. Its short and touching, and 
its originally ridiculous French narration (which even 
included giving the penguins voiceovers) was replaced by 
the always-sobering Morgan Freeman. The best part? You 
just cannot say no to a bird in a tux.

Batman Begins
Oh, Batman. This movie has single-handedly saved superhero movies for another few 
years. Batman Begins, which was a franchise reboot  throwing off the shackles of 
Joel Schumachers cinematic travesties  ended up a legitimate film, with stirring 
performances and fantastic filmmaking by Chris Nolan, the director of Memento. 
Christian Bale (.Equilibrium, American Psycho) plays Bruce Wayne almost perfectly, and 
the supporting cast keeps the standard of quality high throughout the film. Liam Neeson 
and rising star Cillian Murphy both put out memorable performances, and Gary Oldman 
and Morgan Freeman lend class to their small roles. The action sequences are decidedly 
Batman-esque (no pow!s and snuh!s, though), and the new Batmobile is the coolest 
car to be in a movie since Back to the Futures DeLorean.
Courtesy of www.imdb.com
Fantastic Four
For every hit there is a miss. While Batman Begins 
gave new hope to the superhero movie genre, 
Fantastic Four reminded many moviegoers exactly 
how superhero movies can flop like flapjacks. The 
movie takes a lame premisethe Fantastic Four have 
always been sort of boring, since they were created 
before Marvel had come up with the real superhero 
greats like Spiderman and the X-Men  and it cant 
really be saved after that. Chris Evans (whose last big 
movie was the under-the-radar Cellular) is the most 
fun to watch as the Human Torch, because hes selfish, 
mean, and really the only interesting character in the 
movie. In the grand scheme of things, though, its 
probably worth a dollar  Jessica Alba does strip 
down to her underwear at least once.
Red Eye
Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams have both had 
good summers. Rachel McAdams had a starring 
role in Wedding Crashers, which has been one of the 
most successful movies of the summer, and Cillian 
Murphy gained tons of attention with his creepshow 
performance in Batman Begins. In Red Eye, the two 
pair up to tell the tale of a yong woman and the 
handsome stranger who threatens to kill her father 
unless she aids his plans. The film is very clearly 
separated into three acts  the first act sets up the 
action extremely well, and the second act begins to 
drip with tension as it unfolds. The final act is typical 
fare for director Wes Craven, with jack-in-the-boxstyle scares and a Scream-style standoff at home. 
Craven delivered a perfectly serviceable thriller with 
a bit of unpredictability and very watchable stars, 
and it is a fantastic way to waste the evening  even 
at full theater prices.
Wedding Crashers
Smart comedies are fun. Especially smart comedies that also make jokes about steroids 
in backyard football, Klingons, and forbidden homosexual love. Vince Vaughn and 
Owen Wilson are at the top of their form as they show up uninvited to wedding after 
wedding in a perennial search for girls. But when Wilson falls for a bridal sister at their 
wedding and the other sister falls for Vaughn, their strategy fails and hijinks ensue. 
Vaughns over-the-top comedic desperation makes Wedding Crashers worth watching 
on its own, but the performances all gel together extremely well  and Christopher 
Walken actually manages to avoid stealing the show during his scenes, a problem that 
plagues many of his movies.

The Real Carnegie Mellon University
What they didnt tell you at Orientation: a guide to surviving your first year
Icebreakers
If introductions do take place, however, they will not 
be like the innumerable icebreakers forced upon new 
students. Both Playfair and activities run by resident 
advisors and orientation counselors have good 
intentions, and serve the purpose of loosening up a 
potentially nervous  and therefore quiet  bunch of 
kids.
But the icebreakers get old, noted Katelynn Benton, 
a first-year in CIT. We know. Everything from Big 
Booty to Two Truths and a Lie exhausts itself 
after one round. Anything different winds up being 
repetitive. Besides, when applied to a real-life situation, 
are icebreakers reasonable? Are you going to turn to the 
kid sitting next to you in lecture and ask him to play Big 
Booty in an effort to get to know him better? Didnt 
think so.
The Food
philosophically about the meaning of your existence as 
a Carnegie Mellon University first-year.
So welcome to CMU. Take a deep breath. Hold for as 
long as possible. Because although Orientation 
generates plenty of preconceived notions about life at 
Carnegie Mellon that turn out false, the illusion that time 
flies  and that time is a precious commodityis fairly 
permanent. Life at CMU is nothing less than the cliched 
rollercoaster ride, an experience fast and intense, filled 
with ups and downs. To help you figure things out, The 
Tartan has graciously volunteered to save you some 
time by clarifying some things Orientation may have 
made confusing.
Playfair
Playfair is not representative of life at Carnegie Mellon 
University. Playfair was fun because everyone had 
so much energy and there was so much activity, said 
first-year Lindsey Snider, a biology major. Another firstyear, Amanda Dilenno, a chemical engineering major,
chimed in, It was great because you got to meet all 
these random people.
Playfair has some good qualities to it; the energy built 
up in each freshman by the lady behind the mic leads 
to a lot of in-the-moment excitement and enthusiasm. 
When that enthusiasm combines with the activities of 
Playfair, freshmen do get to meet new people. But while 
all the introductions create an illusion of friendliness 
and outgoingness, remember that its the entire 
point of Playfair. All the activities are geared toward 
introductions, mostly to people you may not even 
recognize later without their grey Orientation T-shirt. 
Which isnt to say the student body is socially inept and 
incapable of recalling faces; rather, you meet so many 
people, and under forced pretenses, that its nearly 
impossible to remember everyone you meet during 
that hour and a half.
What Playfair has to its advantage is, among other 
things, the energy and enthusiasm that comes naturally 
when one is placed in a completely new environment. 
Playfair feeds off the adrenaline rush coming from each 
first-year, an energy that wears off by the end of first 
semester. And when the adrenaline does wear off, youll 
find a ton of friendly people, but not quite as many 
trying to find three things they have in common with 
you in less than a minute.
Dexter Hu/Photo Staff
First-year students participate in a trust test during Playfair by sitting on their friends knees without falling down.
Thinking about the food you ate during Orientation 
probably conjures up images of boxed meals; but dont 
fear, you shouldnt see a boxed meal around campus
So youve been here a little less than a week, and you 
dont know what to do with yourself. Orientation 
2005, Send Me On My Way, should have been called 
Camp CMU. Youre still programmed to automatically 
spit out your name, major, and hometown when you 
meet someone new (which is all the time this week). 
Youve only just rid yourself of the Scarlet Letter of all 
freshmen  the bright green wristband. Youve tossed 
your Orientation schedule, unless of course youre 
saving it for the scrapbook youre not going to have time 
to make. And youre pretty sure youve finally showered 
enough to rid yourself of ail the germs you collected 
during Playfair.
The rite of passage into the undergraduate body of 
Carnegie Mellon University is complete, and you 
can proudly proclaim, a la Pinocchio, Im a real 
freshman! Only, youre still not completely sure what 
real freshmen do. Or what real life is like at CMU.
Orientation packs in so many activities into a sevenday period that reading this article is probably the first 
chance youve gotten to breathe all week, let alone think

First year students rush to finish in a hula hoop competition on the Mall for House Wars. Morewood Gardens emerged as the 
victor.
until next Orientation. But bets are that you will be 
missing those little packaged lunches sooner than later.
The off*campus rumor mill generally puts CMUs food 
in the lower ranks, but the greater issue is really a lack 
of variety. Most people know whats in their soup, but 
they face a bigger problem: finding a place to eat that 
they havent frequented in the last 24 hours. Usually 
they discover thats not an option. Sure, youll have fun 
eating at various on-campus eateries for the first week, 
maybe even the first month, but eventually youll figure 
out what you like and what you hate. And then youll get 
tired of the same old same old. Occasionally youll come 
across a catered event, presumably run by the same 
caterers who supplied some of the food at Orientation. 
Frosted brownies and lemonade, anyone?
Oh, and the free food all the frat barbeques offer may 
seem like a great dealwho can forgo free food?but 
it generally doesnt work to your monetary advantage. 
Meal plans tend to offer an abundance of meal blocks 
you cant use in a two-week time period, and a minimum 
of DineX you can only spend on over-priced items, so 
our advice is to use your meal blocks when possible.
There is some hope for food on campus this year, as 
several restaurants have been switched around, added, 
and moved. Pepperazzis spot in the gallery has been 
taken over by a new restaurant, Bento Bowl. S Seor 
has moved over to CK Pretzels spot, and S Seors old 
spot has been taken by Pepperazzi.
The Time Factor
Did you think that after all the Orientation activities 
you would have time to relax? Guess again! As Snider 
added, In Orientation, there was no free time; there 
was so much we had to do with our dorms. Well, the 
beginning of school certainly wont change the amount 
of free time youll have.
Ethan Jackson, a first-year mathematics major, said, 
The team-building exercises were kind of silly. But 
let us be the first to tell you  you will wish you were 
playing the name game when you have a desk piled high 
with work to do.
The Sleep Factor
Yeah, partying late at the frats during Orientation and 
then having to wake up for an essentially mandatory 8:30 
am breakfast is less than pleasant. Getting less than ten 
hours of sleep? Who does that? You do. Starting now. As 
a matter of fact, you can cut that ten-hour sleep time in 
half, multiply it by three, add five, subtract the quantity 
two times two, find the square root of that number, and 
consider that your newly allotted amount of sleep per 
night  if youre lucky.
Okay, so if theres no free time, and you use your free 
time to sleep, where does having a life come in?
You mean, academics arent your life? They dont make
you jump for joy? Lectures and studios arent where you 
planned on spending most of your time? Granted, you 
did choose Carnegie Mellon for a reason. You probably 
recognized and were even. somewhat excited about 
the excellent academics offered here. But friends are 
important, and youll find them in your classes. Study 
groups are your new hangout.
Jackson anticipates the melding of two different worlds 
on CMUs campus, saying, I hope that math majors and 
art majors can spend time together. They can, and some 
do; it depends on how they meet. There is a saying that 
floats around about Carnegie Mellon though, regarding 
the fruits and vegetables: it refers to the somewhat 
physical campus divide between the College of Fine Arts 
and, well, the rest of campus.
So maybe we have painted a somewhat exaggerated 
picture of life at CMU. We will admit that you can have 
a life at Carnegie Mellon University. But, just like all the 
classes you have and the grades you want, youll have to 
work at it. Extracurricular activities are terrific places to 
meet people, and when you do have time (probably at the 
cost of sleep, but thats the way the cookie crumbles), the 
mirage that is a life will materialize. Take a bus to the 
Strip or South Side, wander around Oakland or Squirrel 
Hill, go to the Conservatory. Pittsburgh has potential.
As do classes and professors. Some professors spent 
Orientations Academic Day using the scare tactic 
(hard work), and others spent it being overly nice and 
portraying an academic atmosphere and life as pleasant 
as a romp through tulips and daisies. Both versions of 
classes are realistic to expect, although tulips and daisies 
do die during cold weather. And what about all those 
department heads who talked on Academic Day and 
at Convocation? Their appearance was probably just a 
fluke; were pretty sure theyre actually quite reclusive. 
Unless youre one of those remarkably involved campus 
folks  you know, the kind who can survive 48 hours 
without sleep  the chances of seeing those people 
again, or hearing from them in any sort of way, is slim 
to none.
Just dont be like those hermetic figureheads. Dont 
dwell in your dorm room all day; resist the 24-hourplus Dungeons & Dragons marathon. Choose your food 
wisely (and your friends, too, of course). Dont expect 
life at CMU to be like Orientation at CMU  college is 
not summer camp. Make an effort to wring out every 
spare minute of the day, and use those extra minutes 
wisely. Buckle up for the proverbial ride of your life.

HOROSCOPES.
BY LARA VOIGT
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Just because youve been slaving away in a lab all 
summer doesnt mean you have to prove it by blinding people as you walk across 
campus. Take a few afternoons to sit in the sun, or at least invest in some sunless 
tanner before the weekend.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): With all the money youve made working this 
summer, don't you think its time you spent a little bit of it on your dorm 
room? Then again, a nice layout may just give you an excuse to stay in and play 
computer games all day... but at least others will want to be in there with you.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): As repetitious and scary as those dreams have 
been, dont worry, your physics textbook will not come alive and attack your 
hand! At least not yet  watch out for it on the 3rd, and on the afternoon of 
the 10th.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Take the time to walk down to Oakland or Squirrel 
Hill this week  it may be what you need to remind yourself how real people 
live when not at college.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Dont rush into anything this week. Even though you 
may think declaring your love for the guy you met in biology two days ago is a 
good idea, he may believe otherwise.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): A new year has started, meaning there will 
be a few hundred fewer people to remind you of your, well, not so memorable 
moments of last year. So this week, dont be afraid to leave your room or talk to 
people. Just avoid the new printing kiosks for a while...
LIBRA. (September 23 - October 22): College! A time to break out, to rebel, 
to find new friends in new places, and to learn that home food really was an 
amazing thing not to be taken for granted. Dont get too distracted with all 
the newor re-found freedom though  that organic chem class youve been 
dreading all summer really is as bad as youve imagined.
SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21): Keep those connections you made over 
the summer  a late-night phone call in the near future could lead to a new 
relationship. If you happen to find the on-campus options just a bit too limited, 
that is.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): This next week will be filled with 
decisions for you  whether to go out with some newfound friends or stay in 
and get a head start on your programming homework. I dont think you need a 
horoscope to tell you which path will lead to better memories.
CAPRICORN (December 22 -January 19): While your 8:30 am lecture might be 
the most painful experience you'll have in a while, dont fall asleep or you might 
lose more than that $20 crumpled up in your pocket. (Pop quiz, anyone?)
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): After being on campus for roughly two 
days, you may be starting to feel as if your single life will be never-ending. But 
dont worry, soon youll realize that everyone else is thinking the exact same 
thing, and that your laptop makes quite a good replacement for a girlfriend.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You may feel that because youve been at 
CMU for so long youve become acquainted with practically everyone, but youll 
be surprised how many new faces there are in your classes. Take the plunge and 
introduce yourself to a few new people this week  you won't regret it. Well, not 
all of them at least.
