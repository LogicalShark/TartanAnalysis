BASKETBALL TEAM 10 MEET WESIIMOUSE
First Game of Season.
The season opens on Saturday 
night at 8:15 with the game against 
the strong Westinghouse Club five 
of Wilkinsburg. Westinghouse has 
made a splendid showing against 
Yale and Lehigh and promise to be 
a most spirited contender for the up
per hand. Playing such teams is a 
valuable experience with which to 
be prepared for a fresh team and the 
home five will have to show a decided 
superiority in order to win this op
ener.
Coach Nichols is hard at work how
ever and with the able support of 
the candidates a fast and agressive 
game will undoubtedly result. The 
first five is still in question and the 
coach and Captain Hines are hold
ing continual consultation to deter
mine who the successful candidates 
are to be. We have two teams that 
are about evenly matched and to pick 
one of these is a difficut and, in some 
respects, and unpleasant task. No 
doubt both of these teams will be used 
before the game is concluded. Cap
tain Hines is the unquestionable lea
der and will start the season with 
his usual splendid performance. For 
the other postions the letter men will 
probably be started but may be sub
stituted at any time by one of the 
excellent new candidates. Tumpane 
at forward, Meredith at center and 
Henning at the other guard put three 
experienced men on the floor to supContinued on Page 6

Several of the aspiring candidates 
for the Varsity five betook themselves 
to the large and flourishing metro
polis of three states commonly known 
as Steubenville, but here known as 
Stubbinsville, to compete with the 
Y. M. C. A. team of that aforesaid 
flourishing metropolis, on the basket
ball arena. Henning and Manager 
Ammerman guilelessly led the way

makes this metropolis his home, join

GREAT WORK IS STARTED AT TE(H
FACULTY AND STUDENTS ARE TO JOIN IN 
PHILANTHROPIC MOVEMENT. WORK 
INDORSED BY THE DEANS OF ALL 
SCHOOLS AND SUPPORTED BY 
PROMINENT FACULTY 
MEMBERS
A few days before the holidays the 
Deans of the four schools appointed 
a joint committee of faculty and stu
dents to study the problem of help
ing in the work of relief of the noncombatant sufferers from the war.
In the two meetings held it was 
decided that the first essential step 
was to acquaint the whole school body 
with the purpose and plan of the 
undertaking and to present the needs 
of those for whom the work is being 
organized.
In the brief articles that follow the 
attempt has been made to show the 
conditions that exist at present in the 
countries where the needs are great
est, and where help can be given. The 
descriptions of conditions are based 
upon the reports of competent ob
servers and are trustworthy.
The Condition in Armenia.
Several months ago there was 
formed in New York a committee 
known as The American Committee 
on Armenian Atrocities. Serving on 
this committee are Samuel T. Dutton, 
Oscar Straus, Bishop Greer, Rabbi 
Wise, Norman Hapgood, Charles R. 
Crane and others of prominence. They 
have gathered evidence from twentyfour reliable sources and made a re
port of their findings. This report is 
an account of peaceful people driven 
under the whip like beasts from their 
homes into exile among populations 
of different race, religion and lan
guage, of prisoners tortured, women 
outraged, children drowned, old men 
beaten to death, of starvation and 
suffering, loot and massacre. The 
committee states that the Armenians 
have been the victims of crimes sur
passing in their horror and cruelty 
anything that history has recorded in 
the last thousand years. Convinced 
of the great need of this worthy peo
ple, the committee is now devoting 
its energies to the work of relief.
The population of Turkish Armenia 
was about 1,500,000. Viscount Bryce, 
after thorough investigation, is con
vinced that of this number more than
800,000 were massacred during the 
last few months. The deliberate at
tempt has been made to exterminate 
the whole Armenian race.
The invasion of Turkey by a Rus
sian army pavpd many of the Armen
ians from massacre, and when this 
army again returned to Russian soil 
about 250,000 Armenians went with it. 
They are now crowded into small 
centers where they are fighting with 
cold, starvation and disease. Their 
need is most urgent.
The American Ambassador to Tur
key, Mr. Morgenthau, states that the 
conditions among the Armenians are 
appalling and that large amounts of 
money are needed for distribution 
through missionaries and the Ameri
can consul at Aleppo. There are 
probably 300,000 destitute Armenians 
scattered through the hostile Moham
medan population of Turkey. With
in the last few days word has come 
to the New York committee of the ar
rival at Erivan of 110,000 Armenian 
refugees in great destitution.
Help is imperative and must come 
quickly, or it will be too late. No 
gift is too small to be insignificant. 
It is said that a dollar will keep a 
family a week.
Belgium.
Conditions in Belgium have been 
improved to a certain extent, but the 
need for assistance is still great. The 
larger part of the population of seven 
million is idle; there is nothing for 
them to do. Much of the land is being 
tilled, but the factories are closed. In 
spite of the fact that the Belgians are 
doing as much as they can to help 
themselves, over one million are en
tirely dependent and they are likely 
to remain so for several months after 
the war is ended. To feed these peo
ple it is costing $7,500.000 every 
month. This does not take into ac
count the money which some Belgians 
are able to pay for food, but it is the 
amount which must be raised on the 
outside to help pay for food alone.
But the greatest need in Belgium 
today is not for food. $5,000,000 is 
needed to buy warm new clothing for 
three million destitute people. Sec
ond-hand clothing will not do, as the 
rigid regulations of the health authori
ties do not allow such articles to enter 
European ports. Prof. Kellogg, of Leland Stanford, who has just returned 
from Europe, says that the need 
for clothes and shoes in Belgium to
day is greater than ever before. AmerContinued on Page 4
HEW STADIUM IS TO BE A REALITY
Work To Start As Soon As Weather 
Permits.
It is just a matter of a few weeks 
until the work on the new stadium 
is started. Only the side adjoining 
Woodlawn avenue is to be finished 
at present. The remainder will be 
completed after a final decision is ar
rived at concerning the remainder of 
the groups.
The new field is to have a quarter 
mile running track. The old idea of 
placing the track underneath the 
bleachers has been dropped. The 
bleachers themselves will be concrete 
built on a concrete pile. The side to 
be completed at oncii will be 550 feet 
long seating from 6,000 to 7,000. 
Chairs will be provided similar to 
those in Forbes Field. There is a 
slight slope on Woodlawn avenue 
which has been a puzzle to the ar
chitect and engineers in what to do 
on the arrangement of the tiers of 
seats. They wanted to keep the same 
slope on the bleachers as is on the 
street, which is about 14 feet in 500. 
They finally decided to make a slight 
increase in the rise of each tier, as 
it neared the high end. This re
sulted in very desirous arrangement. 
There will be about 19 rows of seats. 
Aisles will be provided every 30 feet, 
which will provide a quick emptying 
of the stands.
The field will be enclosed by a fivefoot wall, having three large exits on 
the side and large entrances embracContinued on Page 6
INTERCOLLEGIATE HOCKEY 
LEAGUE FORMED.
Games To Be Played at Duquesne 
Garden.
All those who are interested in 
hockey will probably be pleasantly 
surprised to hear of the formation of 
a league here in Pittsburgh. The for
mation of the league took place last 
Saturday afternoon, but no permanent 
schedule for the games has as yet 
been adopted. The members of the 
league at present are, Tech, Pitt, the 
P. A. A., and the alumni of Yale and 
Princeton. The craze for hockey this 
year in Pittsburgh was the cause of 
the foundation of the league, for never 
before has skating been so popular 
here. The games will all be played 
at Duquesne Garden; none, however, 
will take place until a later date. This 
allows plenty of time for practice and 
by the time the schedule does open 
the teams should all be highly develContinued on Page 5

RELIEF WORK.
On the first page of this issue an 
article has been published in refer
ence to the relief work to be taken up 
by a joint committee of faculty and 
students. This article has been writ
ten especially by individuals whose 
reports are authentic and whose ideas 
are important and trustworthy. In 
connection with this movement The 
Tartan wishes to express its utmost 
approval, and wishes not only to state 
its own appreciation of this enterprise 
but urges the enlistment of every 
loyal Tech student in this cause. The 
committee at present has not drawn 
up any definite plans for securing the 
relief for the war-stricken non-com
batant sufferers, but these will soon 
follow. When the opportunity is pre
sented we are sure that every student 
of Tech will do his share. Whatever 
is given should come from the heart, 
and for the sake of uplifting and aid
ing others far less fortunate than our
selves.
Other schools all over the country 
are doing all in their power. At the 
University of Missouri the fraterni
ties and sororities have taken up the 
work and are giving entertainments 
to obtain funds for such relief work. 
Yale has sent ambulances for the Red 
Cross work, and many other institu
tions are following in similar foot
steps. And so it should be our duty 
to lead in this movement.
UNIFORMITY IN HAZING.
As the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology grows older the customs and 
traditions become more firmly plant
ed in the hearts of the student body. 
Often, however, these customs and 
traditions can be corrected or elimi
nated with benefit to the school.
There has been to this date and 
now a decided lack of uniformity and 
co-operation in hazing between the 
different schools and in each school 
itself. Science has put forth great 
efforts to have other schools join 
them in the so-called Carnegie Code 
which has proved successful. Can not 
the other schools come to an under
standing and put into effect the next 
years a code of rules that can effect 
all schools, give an air of co-operation 
instead of dissimilation?
The schools have found that the 
methods of hazing that are becoming 
prevalent are neither amusing nor 
conductive to a feeling of loyalty on 
the part of every Plebe to the school. 
The hazing was never harmful but 
rather silly and childish with practi
cally no redeeming features. The illfeeling caused by some of this foolish 
hazing often turned the friendly riv
alry that should exist between Plebe 
and Sophomore into enmity. It is 
possible to instill into the hearts of 
the incoming classes the due respect 
and loyalty to their Alma Mater 
without humiliating them in a manner 
as undignifying to the Sophomore as 
to the Plebe.
We suggest that committee from 
Senior classes of all schools get to
gether and formulate a set of rules 
that can be successfully enforced 
without enmity on the part of any 
concerned. The committee should re
member that it is not what the Plebes 
are asked to do but how they do it 
which counts.
STUDENT FINANCIERING.
From day to day we are confronted 
with the serious problem of student 
credit, as involved in the overdrawing 
of bank accounts and the wilful neg
lect of lawfully incurred debts. So 
remarks a worthy contemporary in the 
Middle West. There is no doubt 
same conditions exist In our school, 
but here we are thankfully not so 
intimate with such examples of high 
finance, as in the college paper in 
a small town.
The surest way to learn is by ex
perience, and so the surest way for 
a student to learn that his resources 
are limited is by jumping into debt. 
A fathers admonition to his son will 
hardly restrain a student from over
stepping his allowance. In fact it 
has become such a habit to live be
yond ones means that the matter of 
balancing liabilities and assets is 
scarcely given a thought. It is ru
mored that some occasional men are 
living on a cash basis, but there are 
said to be few.
Is the student altogether respon
sible for his reputation in this regard? 
The freshman comes to college and 
for the first time he is entrusted with 
the care of financing himself. It is 
a business entirely new to himwith
many it is the first connection with 
any business at all. Unless he is care
ful, he will overdraw his accounts or 
at the first of the month find himself 
with bills which he is unable to pay. 
A few dollars deficit may be only a 
beginning and by the end of the first 
or second year he will be hopelessly 
involved.
We are inclined to believe that the 
student debt is more often the fault 
of the merchant, or the tailor, or some 
one else with goods to sell. Too often 
the student is encouraged to open an 
account when he realizes he is not in 
a position to do so, and when a 
weakling falls into the snare of a 
glib salesman he may as well surren
der.
In justification of the student, it 
can be held, however, that this earn
est desire for his business, even on 
a credit basis, is enough to emphasize 
that his word is good in such transac
tions. The money that is lost on col
lege men is not much. Even the least 
responsible realize that a debt law
fully incurred must sooner or later be 
paid.
AN APOLOGY.
The lack of M. M. C. S. news in this 
issue is due to the loss in the C. I. 
T. post office of the entire copy for 
this issue, amounting to three col
umns of material. This loss is un
explainable as yet, but the editors 
feel it keenly, and offer them most 
humble apologies to the M. M. C. S., 
although the omission is no fault of 
their own.
LETTER FROM PROF. WURTS.
The following letter form Prof. A. 
J. Wurts, head of the Electrical Engi
neering Department. As one of the 
charter members of the faculty, so to 
speak, Prof. Wurts is particularly 
qualified as an advisor to the student 
body, having had the opportunity to 
become thoroughly familiar with stu
dent life here at Carnegie Tech.
To tbe Tech Students, Greetings:
The Editor of the Tartan has in
vited me to write a letter which might 
be helpful to the student body. Here 
it is, and if it should prove helpful to 
a single individual only I shall be 
amply repaid for may effort.
In most cases, when young men go 
to college, they leave their homes and 
in so doing assume new and untried 
responsibilitiesenter upon a new 
field of experience. They learn for 
the first time to take care of them
selves and pay their own bills. Many 
earn a part of their living. They are 
brought into contact with new people. 
They find themselves in a new at
mosphere. Students from other parts 
of the country become their friends. 
They enter into student activities. A 
new life is begun.
These factors are combined and 
work together with the scholastic life 
to broaden the students point of view 
and lead him on toward a higher and 
more efficient manhood.
Unfortunately most students fail to 
see, understand or appreciate the 
potentiality of their new environment.
In writing this letter, I have in
mind one particular factor in college 
lifean opportunity peculiar to col
lege days which is, I fear, greatly neg
lected by the majority of students. I 
refer to the new situation of being 
away from home and which requires 
a letter at more or less frequent inter
vals to father, mother or other rela
tive.
Here, my friends, is an opportunity 
worth considering. Too often do we 
fail to appreciate opportunities like 
this until we have gone far enough to 
look back and see what we have missed 
and then, perhaps, it is too late.
So, with new and interesting sur
roundings, new people, new experi
encesa great variety of things to 
write aboutand a warning, will, like 
this, there is no excuse.
Now!Are you going to slip 
through four years of college life and 
miss this great opportunity to improve 
in the art of letter writing? Are you 
satisfied to graduate from Tech, writ
ing a schoolboy hand and a schoolboy 
letter? Are your home letters to be 
hasty lines written in left-over mo
ments? Or, will you rise to a full 
appreciation of the opportunity before 
you and write home ONCE A WEEK, 
FOR FOUR YEARS, each time put
ting forth your best effort to write a 
good letter?
The ability to write clearly, force
fully and entertainingly is a power 
well worth cultivating, a power that 
will make for nobler ideals, broaden 
possibilities and higher levels in life, 
to say nothing of the self respect that 
it brings and the pleasure it gives to 
others.
Can you now write a letter worth 
keeping or reading the second time? 
Can you write an article that would 
be acceptable to the Tartan? Try it. 
Can you write the specifications for 
a work bench so that they can be 
understood? PossiblyBut, can you 
write the same specifications so that 
they cannot be misunderstood?
So, my message to you is this: If
you earnestly desire to succeedto 
rise to higher levels and meet men of 
affairs on equal terms, learn to write 
a good letter. The opportunity is be
fore yau now! Dont wait until you 
?re a Sophomore, or a Junior, or a 
Senior, or until you have more time. 
Do it now. Once a week write a clear, 
well expressed and interesting letter 
borne. Do your BEST EACH TIME. 
Keep your first letters for comparison 
and after four years write your imnressions to the Tartan and so help 
the next fellow.
Yours truly,
A. J. WURTS.

Santa Claus reigned supreme at 
Sigma Tau House on Thursday even
ing, December 23. Invited by the ex
tremely well choseis decorations and 
the prettily decorated Christmas tree. 
He brought presents to everyone and 
an abundance of good cheer to all. 
The Grads were there in goodly num
bers and showed that the zest of 
Christmas cheer was not lessened by 
a few bumps of the outside world. 
Professor and Mrs. H. C. Long and 
Mr. and Mrs. H. J. McCorkle saw to 
it that Santa cared for everyone and 
incidentally chaperoned the party. 
Strange as it may seem, Tubby 
Lain received a diamond solitaire as 
his gift, while Sammy Howe is 
still wondering what to do with the 
pack of cards Santa brought him.
Sigma Rho started the Inner Fra
ternity Basket Ball Schedule by de
feating the East Dorm, 22 to 17, on 
Thursday evening, December 16.
The Woodlawn Clubs annual 
Christmas party which was held at 
their home on December 14, was a de
cided success. The house was beau
tifully decorated in keeping with the 
season and this together with the 
gorgeous tree, inspired the Christmas 
spirit. A number of comical contests 
were conducted which brought forth 
much laughter and mirth at the be
ginning of the evening and continued 
until the guests had taken their leave. 
Gifts were taken from the tree and 
distributed to every person present 
who responded by a short speech. A 
dainty lunch was served and the jolly 
crowd departed, naming the evening 
an occasion never to be forgotten.
The New Years dinner given at 
the house, was enjoyed by all. Among 
those guests present were: Mr. and
Mrs. Wm. M. Sheldon, Miss Van 
Horn, Mr. Frank Markley, Mr. Al
bert McClester, Mr. Walter Sonturn, 
and Mr. Samuel McNulty.
NEW YORK CLUB BANQUET.
During the holidays the southern 
tier branch of the New York State 
Club held a banquet at the Hotel 
Sherwood, Hornell, N. Y. Students 
from the University of Buffalo and 
Syracuse University and also some 
High School men were present. The 
idea in having a banquet at this time 
was to promote good-fellowship and 
give the prospective engineers and 
architects an insight into what we 
have at Carnegie Tech in an educa
tional and also in an athletic line. 
The enthusiasm aroused in the affair 
can be understood when we say that 
Tuby Lain was there from Elmira 
and acted as toastmaster. Similar 
banquets were held throughout the 
State under the auspices of the Club. 
Such affairs offer a very effectual way 
of advertising the school and at the 
same time allow the men to meet rep
resentatives from other schools and 
get their ideas of college life. If the 
other banquets turned out as well as 
the one at Hornell under C. F. Hofstetters direction, the New York 
State Club can look forward to a 
bright future.

TECH LOSES GOOD FRIEND.
Mrs. F. M. Young, of 15 Mawhinney street, died at Mercy Hospital, 
December 27th, after a short illness. 
Since the foundation of the schools 
Mrs. Young has maintained a home 
for boys. She took a personal inter

GREAT WORK STARTED

tions.
An article in the Gazette Times, 
dated January 2, states that a thor
ough investigation into the needs of 
shoes and clothing for the people in 
the war-stricken countries has been 
made by a corps of investigators for 
the Rockefeller Foundation. The boys 
in Belgium and Northern France need
100.000 pairs of shoes, 400,000 shirts,
200.000 jerseys or sweaters, 200,000 
combination or union suits, 200,000 
pairs of trousers, 200,000 coats, 100,000 
capes or overcoats, 400,000 pairs of 
woolen stockings, and 100.000 hats or 
caps. There is also a crying need for 
more than 100,000 blankets.
Polands Tragedy.
The war has for many months been 
raging on the Eastern front, chiefly 
over Polish soil. It is sweeping away 
every sign of civilization, destroying 
dwellings, devastating fields, gardens 
and forests, starving and exterminat
ing human beings and animals alike. 
In the desolated area as large as the 
states of New York, PennsylvaniaNew Jersey, Connecticut and Massa
chusetts, four hundred towns and 
twelve thousand five hundred vil
lages have been partially, many 
of them completely ruined. One 
million horses and two million 
horned cattle have been destroy
ed or seized. Scarcely a grain 
of corn, a scrap of meat, or a 
drop of milk have been left for the 
civil population. Losses to date in 
property destroyed and agricultural, 
industrial and commercial production 
paralyzed, are estimated to amount to 
$9,000,000,000.
The horrors of the gigantic strug
gle have overwhelmed more than 18--
000,000 inhabitants. Fully 11,000,000 
of helpless men, women and children; 
peasants, workingmen and their fam
ilies have been rendered homeless. 
Hundreds of thousands are hiding 
among ruins, in woods or in caves, 
subsisting on roots and the bark of 
trees. Hundreds of thousands of 
once prosperous families are helpless, 
hungry, sick and dying.
Eye-witnesses described the bread 
lines in Warsaw with 1,000 to 1,500 
old men, women and children stand
ing in the snowmany of them withoutshoes and all poorly clad, waiting 
to receive their daily ration of carrot 
soup and one-four of a pound of 
bread, furnished by private charity. 
There are said to be 175,000 refugees 
in Warsaw alone.
To the small portion of the civil 
population of Poland within reach of 
the German military forces a daily 
ration of one-fifth of a pound of bread 
is issued. This statement should be 
taken in connection with the finding 
of the war relief commission of the 
Rockefeller foundation that six-tenths 
of a pound of bread per day is the 
minimum on which a person can sub
sist. But millions of people are be
yond the reach of even such inade
quate assistance as this. Only private
charity on a tremendous scale can 
prevent the death from cold and starv
ation of thousands upon thousands of 
persons, innocent victims of the hor
rors of war. And with the spring 
will come a new enemy, for cholera, 
typhus and other contageous diseases 
will thrive among the enervated peo
ple surrounded by countless putrefy
ing unburied dead bodies of animals 
and men.
The one element that is essential 
to the success of our work, says 
Paderewski in his stirring appeal for 
aid, is promptness. The needs are 
so pressing that todays contribution, 
even though smaller than what might 
be given tomorrow, will be more effec
tual in saving human life and contrib
uting to the succor of the helpless 
women and children.
Serbia.
At present not much news comes to 
this country in regard to the condi
tions in Serbia. That Serbia is suf
fering as Belgium and Poland suffer 
there is no doubt.
Wm. G. Shepherd, writing from 
Salnica December 16, says that a 
million Serbian women and girls are 
facing intense suffering and possible 
death through lack of food and cloth
ing. Well fed and well clothed sol
diers suffered intensely from the cold 
in Southern Serbia.
When the Serbian army retreated 
the women and girls were left behind 
in many of the villages. Lacking food 
and proper clothing they are at the 
mercy of the winter. Refugees arriv
ing at Salnica declare that only 
America can find out what is actually 
happening in Serbia today and send 
aid as was done in the case of Bel
gium.
An appeal for relief of the starving 
Serbians by Madame Gronitch, an 
American woman, made last fall, met 
with hearty response, particularly 
from the middle western cities of the 
United States. Undoubtedly the needs 
are even greater now. Committees in 
New York and Boston are working 
for the relief of the Serbian destitute. 
They need our help.
Letter from Prof. Willet.
In the presence of such misery and 
suffering as has been inadequately de
scribed above, all questions of blame 
and responsibility must take second 
place. It is not so important to deter
mine how such things come to be as 
it is to discover and apply methods 
of relief. Millions upon millions of 
human beings, now-combatants and 
for the most part women and chil
dren, are on the verge of dying from 
starvation and exposure. Help cannot 
come from within as the necessities of 
life no longer exist in these countries, 
ravaged and devastated by war nor 
have the people driven out of their 
homes and dispossessed of their prop* 
erty, the means to purchase such nec
essities if they were to be had. Relief 
must come from without and on a 
tremendous scale. Millions of dol
lars a month for an indefinite time to 
come will be needed to supply these 
innocent sufferers from the war with 
sufficient food, clothing and shelter 
to keep them alive.
The United States has already given 
generously to this course. Relief
agencies have been organized on all 
sides. But the demands are contin
ually on the increase as the hour 
of actual warfare enlarges, and to keep 
up with the increasing demands con
stantly increasing donations must be 
forthcoming. The duty of meeting 
these demands rests principally upon 
the United States, not only becaues 
she is, for the time being at heart 
profiting so largely at the expense of 
the nations at war but still more by 
virtue of the abundance of her re
sources. Much has been given to us, 
most may well be required of us.
At many institutions of learning 
in our country relief agencies have 
been organized, and the response of 
the students have been generous and 
enthusiastic. Carnegie Tech seems 
to have been somewhat slow about 
taking up the work, for comparatively 
little organized effort has been put 
forth here. It is the belief of the 
present Relief Committee that this 
is not due to any lack of sympathy 
on the part of our student body, but 
rather to a somewhat too absorbing 
interest in our school life and school 
work. College life suffers a great 
deal by being too much out of touch 
with the aaffirs of the great world 
without the college walls. It is the 
plan of the Committee to put before 
every individual connected with our 
institution the opportunity of giving 
such an amount as he or she feels 
able to give for the relief of the suf
fering from the war.
We appeal for a generous response, 
let each person, while considering 
how large a contribution to make, 
bear in mind these four facts. In the 
first place the need is tremendous. 
Never has the civilized world seen 
such an amount of wretchedness and 
destitution as exists in Europe today. 
In the second place contributions 
may be made with the assurance that 
all that is given will reach those who 
need it. For the most part the trans
portation and distribution of the 
means of relief is furnished free of 
charge, and a dollar given here will 
mean a dollars worth of relief over 
there. In the third place the need 
is very pressing. Immediate relief 
is necessary. Every days delay 
means the death of hundreds or thou
sands of our fellow beings. A dol
lar today may do as much good as 
five dollars next month. And finally 
a little will do a lot of good. The 
few cents that any one of us can save 
by foregoing some trifling indulgence, 
will furnish an unfortunate victim of 
the war with the necessities of life 
for a week. Seldom is it as easy to 
do so much good.
Is there any one among us who 
would not give generously and selfsacrificingly to relieve the necessi
ties of a person found starving by 
the roadside?. We give dimes and 
beggars to shady beggars because we 
are not sure that their more or less 
questionable hard luck stories may 
not be true. How then, can we be 
indifferent to such appalling misery 
as millions of people are suffering 
in Europe today? It is because we 
have not sufficient imagination to 
realize the conditions. Take time to

I think your plan to unite the facul
ty and students in an effort for the 
relief of the sufferers in this war is a 
splendid contribution to human neces
sity. People sometimes say mean 
things about Americathat we are 
coining money out of human blood, 
getting rich out of this war, and all 
that. Well, I happen to know that 
many of our industrial establishments 
have refused to take war contracts, 
even at enormous profits, because this 
would interfere with regular trade,

LETTER TO UNCLE JOHN.
Below is printed a copy of the let
ter sent to Uncle John Brashear by 
the Industries Student Assembly on 
the occasion of his 75th birthday last 
month, and also a copy of his reply.
THE STUDENT ASSEMBLY 
SCHOOL OF APPLIED INDUS
TRIES, CARNEGIE INSTI
TUTE OF TECHNOLOGY.
Dr. John A. Brashear,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Uncle John:
The students of the School of Ap
plied Industries, Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, extend heartiest greet
ings upon the happy occasion of ^ur 
seventy-fifth birthday.
Mindful of your many kindnesses, 
our greeting is the full assurance that 
we will try to prove worthy of the 
friendship and service which you have 
so freely bestowed upon us. Best 
wishes for much happiness for many 
more years!
Yours very sincerely,
THE STUDENT ASSEMBLY, 
Cronise K. Koontz, 
Secretary.
Pittsburgh, Pa., Dec. 15, 1915. 
My Dear Mr. Koontz.
You cannot imagine what a lovely 
surprise you gave me when you sent 
the greetings of the Student Assem
bly of the School of Applied Indus
tries of the C. I. T.
All letters and telegrams of that 
memorable occasion are to be bound 
in one volume, but I must ask the 
Committee to let me have this beau
tiful tribute to your friend Uncle 
John put in a nice frame for my 
work den, for I assure you it will 
be in good company.
Will you voice my best wishes 
my heart-felt gratitude for this kindly 
remembrance of all your colleagues 
in the School of Applied Industries 
in which I have always taken a deep 
and abiding interest. The Dean of 
your department is one of my dearest 
friends and I was responsible for his 
appointment as one of the three good 
men to help us work out the great 
problem of the C. I. T.
All good wishes to every one of 
the boys.
Ever yours,
UNCLE OHN.

Its an old story that Tech used to 
put forth hockey teams that could 
beat anything on skates. The reputa
tion of the past teams must be held 
up by the future teams. Hockey 
should prove to be one of the most 
popular sports that has ever been.in
augurated at Tech.
PRACTICE GAME
Continued from Page 1 
ise of two heavy meals and a nights 
lodging (and perhaps a little Party 
which didnt materialize) were not 
the least of the inducements. On 
their arrival several Tech men for 
several miles around greeted this 
noble representation and formed the 
rooting contingent. The hungry 
ones feasted sumptuously on tender 
fried chicken and all that goes to ap
pease the tyrant appetite on an es
capade of this nature, at the Y. M. 
C. A. with an audience looking in 
upon them in wonder. After devot
ing five minutes in seeing the whole 
of the town and buying cards for the 
dear ones at home preparations were 
begun for the contest.
Abrams and Robinson started at 
forward, C. Meredith at center, with 
Slater and Henning at guards. The 
game started at eight oclock with an 
audience for four young ladies, five or 
six male beings, and fifty little boys 
from Steubenville by-ways, that in
sisted on deriving descriptive appelations for the visitors, that rather truly 
betokened their physical aspects. But 
nevertheless the game started after 
they had found the referee and the 
Collegians easily took the lead, the 
first hal enfding 29 to 6. One basket 
had no petticoats and two or three 
strings were added to make up this 
deficiency, chiefly to please Hap, 
who insisted that he "couldnt see. 
It was so apparelled. Lefty however, 
said that he could shoot whether 
there was any basket or not and the 
game continued.
Robinson and his opponent were 
put out of the game after the start 
of the second half because they failed 
to agree peaceably on a few of the 
technicalities o the game, and the 
Collegians lost the services of a 
splendid foul shooter, he having only 
missed one in the first half. Here the 
referee decided that it was unneces
sary to call any more fouls on the 
home team so we hadnt the oppor
tunity to miss him much in this de
partment. Meredith No. 2, took 
Slaters place at guard and Hap 
went forward for Robinson. The Y 
team started in with a rally but were 
unable to keep it up and were soon 
left much behind. Someone of the 
opposition attempted to shove our 
pet canary under the benches in an 
impolite way, C. Meredith interposed 
and the audience started to assume an 
undue interest in the proceedings. By 
putting the Y man off the floor 
peace was again restored. Cary went 
in for C. Meredith and showed good 
form. The game was getting pretty 
rough and fortunately the whistle 
soon blew and the game ended 47 
to 16 in favor of the Collegians. 
Robinson performed excellently, 
Abrams proved to be the speediest 
floor man we have seen for some time, 
and Hap the best shotcaging 7. 
Henning performed well on guard 
and did some nice shooting. The 
Meredith brothers were there also as 
was Cary and all helped things along. 
It was a regular trip and all thanked 
Manager Ammerman for the good time.

Letters Awarded Wednesday Night,

Who was it that said, Only the 
brave deserve the fair? At any rate 
our heroes have received their much 
envied Cs. Must have been rather 
nice for those big fellows to go back 
to the village, walk up to her front 
door, ring the bell, and stand there, 
with a box of sweets in one hand, a 
bunch of flowers in the other, and 
his chest stuck out about a foot, with 
a big plaid C on it. Great stuff! as 
old King Cole would say.
W. F. McCaughey acted as referee 
or master of ceremonies for the even
ing. While Director Hamerschlag 
awarded the emblems. Selections 
were also given for the evenings en
tertainment by the orchestra, choral 
club, Glee club quartet and the Man
dolin club. As each man received his 
letter he appeased the crowds raving 
by some form of a little speech. 
Sunny Kesner undoubtedly said 
something when he exploded the fact 
that he would talk about that which 
he know mostnothing. The same 
thing that Pitt was going to get next, 
as also was Yale and Cornell. (Right, 
Sunny, were all with you.)
The evenings jollification was 
wound up with scrimmage (dancing) 
in the foyer. The entire affair was 
certainly a success and we hope to 
see it repeated next year.

Design School Notes
MANY NEW FEATURES IN DE
SIGN SCHOOL.
A Great Deal of Work Done during 
Vacations.
Since the middle of last March the 
Design School has been the center of 
interest. Aside from the numerous 
social functions new room has been 
made which will be ready for the 
student occupancy by February first. 
The interior work in both wings is 
about eighty-five per cent complete, 
and when the last laborer completes 
his work the Design Building will at 
once open its doors for inspection 
offering the most unique and ade
quate building in the world.
A special emphasis has been de
voted to the plan and decoration of 
the new library. No limit has been 
placed upon the architects range and 
use of decorative material, resulting 
in a keenly delightful conception for 
a modern library. In the library room 
proper, which is a surprisingly large 
room, the walls are to be treated with 
fifteen-inch panels, inlaid with wal
nut, mahogany and ebony. These 
panels are bordered with rich hued 
oak, which will produce the effect of 
tartan plaid. This panelling extends 
from the ceiling to the wainscoting 
level below which rest one hundred 
feet of book casing.
Below the windows along the 
north facade will be left an opening 
in the line of bookcases into which 
large leather covered benches with 
leather backs will be inserted for the 
use of readers. Here a rich grill work 
encloses the steam radiators in such 
a manner that they are entirely hid
den from view.
Directly across the room, in the 
south wall, are three large doorways 
which open directly into the present 
exhibition hall. At the west end of 
the library is a large fire-place so de
signed and illuminated as to produce 
the effect of a blazing burner. At 
the other end open two large leather 
covered doors. Impressive, indeed, 
will be these portals with their leather 
coating studded with large iron spike 
heads. Each end of the room will up
hold one large mural painting.
The floor is detailed in colors and 
patterns of various imaginations, an 
effect which is only accurately attain
able with cork flooring. A keenly 
interesting feature of the room will 
be the ceiling. Here a design from 
an elaborate old rug is to be adapted 
to the plaster of the ceiling, produc
ing an effect to be seen nowhere else 
in North America.
The whole effect of the library is 
one of quietude. No harsh mouldings 
or bookcases will project beyond the 
face of the wall. All is to be kept 
flush with the side walls. Large tables 
with terra cota standards and library 
lamps of special design will harmon
ize with the general atmosphere of 
the room.
The musical department and de
partment of decoration will move in
to new quarters at that time and by 
June the Design School will be set
tled and quietly at work in a build
ing second only to the Ecole des 
Beaux Arts in Paris.
NEW STADIUM TO BE REALITY
Continued from Page 1 
ing ticket offices, etc., at the bridge 
and the Margaret Morrison school. 
The present drawings call for the 
stand to extend within 90 feet of the 
proposed bridge at Morewood ave
nue. The drawings are about com
pleted.
The gymnasium is at present being 
studied in the bridge, although it is 
not fully decided where it shall be 
placed. The tower or head house 
on Science is also being studied. It 
may develop into a building of six 
or seven stories, agreeing in architec
ture with the Central Building, con
taining an auditorium seating ap
proximately 1,000.
The new stadium it is hoped will 
be ready in the early fall, at least the 
middle of the football season. The 
present bleachers on the old field are 
being razed.
A large wooden model of the stad
ium has been constructed and painted 
and is on exhibition in the building 
bureau. It gives an excellent idea 
of the appearance, structure and the 
features embodied in the design.
BASKETBALL SATURDAY

port their Captain. For the other 
forward Lewis will probably start, 
with Abrams, Robinson, Slater, and 
J. Meredith waiting to jump into his 
shoes at the first opportunity. Craig, 
Cary, Kretzler, and Painter will suc
ceed Meredith at some point in the 
game at the discretion of the coach. 
Findley is making a hot chase for 
the guard postion and will undoubted
ly have the opportunity to display 
his skill and aggressiveness. Holzworth, Kelly, Williams and Fletcher 
will be on his tracks however, ready 
to pass by at the first opening. With 
this splendid material, though not 
completely conditioned, Westinghouse will meet an opponent that will 
give them a most interesting contest 
that every Techite will witness with 
pride and pleasure.
The schedule has been definitely 
and finally decided upon and is as it 
was first published in this paper sev
eral weeks ago. University of Buffalo 
will be the next opponent to appear 
on our floor and is at present an un
known quantity although we expect 
to know them better in about a week. 
Then the plaid team goes to Wilkinsburgh for a return engagement with 
Westinghouse on their large floor. 
Everybody can reach Wilkinsburg in 
about twenty minutes and should 
make this one trip with the team as 
they will undoubtedly need your sup
port in the first game on foreign soil.
After the game on Saturday night 
there will be the usual little "hop 
that will put the finishing touches 
to a pleasant evening and make her 
doubly glad that she camedont for

Everybody out then and see if this

P. A. A. SWIMMING MEET.
Tech Third In Intercollegiate Relay.
The first real opportunity for the 
Swimming Team to show just what 
they could do was in the P. A. A. 
meet on Saturday, December 18th. 
The relay race was the main feature 
of the evening with P. A. A., Pitt, 
and Tech as contenders. P. A. A. 
won the race with Pitt second and 
Tech third by quite a distance.
The Tech team was composed of 
Parkes, Rogers, Beckfield and Her
rick. This is the first time Tech has 
even been represented in this line of 
sport and the first year is almost 
always a hoodoo. The fellows had 
only had about a week of practice 
and it is a sure thing that they will 
show better goods in coming meets 
of the year as it is well nigh impos
sible to develop material in a week. 
Besides the intercollegiate relay 
there were many other events, most
ly for juniors.

September 30th.
Next foot-ball season will start with 
the big game with Yale at New Haven 
on September 30th, 1916. This is an
other proof of the increasing respect 
which we are held by the big schools 
of the East. This will be quite a trip 
for the fortunate fellows who make 
the squad and from the comparisons 
of this year should result in a vic
tory for the Plaid. Yale, however, 
will start in with the old bull-dog 
spirit to atone for the last rather 
unsuccessful season and will be pre
pared to tear to pieces everything 
that comes in their way. This means 
that Tech will have to start the fall 
training at an earlier date and will 
have to have a large squad in more 
than early season condition. With 
Coach Walter Steffens back on the 
job and all the experienced men that 
are expected to return we can beat 
Old Eli* batter down the accumulated

HAROLD-CALDWELL.
The marriage of Miss Jane Cald
well, assistant recorder of the School 
of Applied Industries to Mr. R. H. 
Harrold, proprietor of the Build'ng 
Bureau, took place on New Years 
Day in the First Presbyterian Church. 
The happy couple are receiving the 
best wishes of their many friends 
the schools. We expect to hear of a 
big celebration in the little old 
shack later.
SECOND PUPPET BIG SUCCESS.
Can you imagine it? Not that he 
is so impossiblebut, oh, well; heres 
how it happened. On the morning 
of the Hiram-Tech football game he 
and Miss Mercedes Roeser of Crafton, Pa., were quietly united in mar
riage at the Unitarian Church. After 
the wedding they enjoyed their first 
dinner at the Schenley. The re
mainder of the afternoon was spent 
in witnessing the defeat of Hiram by 
Tech. And all this occurred on Oc
tober 30, and no one was the wiser 
till New Years day, when the an
nouncement was received at the 
Woodlawn Club of which he is a 
member.
Cover Design Termed Shocking.
Marked Improvement on Second 
Issue.
Puppet comes forth in its second is
sue with the Saint Old Nick issue 
filled with the Christmas spirit and 
presents to its readers a much better 
number than the previous Maiden 
Issue, which made the name for the 
big Tech fun book.
Joseph Williams is responsible for 
the cover Christmas Eve, which has 
been termed shocking by the out
side world. But the idea is original 
and the drawing a credit to the Art 
School.
J. B. Sprague, known to every Tech 
man as Tonge, has written a satire 
on Kipling, his Song of the Clerk 
is genuine to the life of the pen push
er. C. Forrest Crooks illustrated the 
rhymes and made an interesting page 
in the book.
The Tartans Art Editor has pic
tured many lives in the book special
izing on his * double page cartoon 
Merry Christmas. His Filling the 
Christmas Stokging adds a page 
which will delight the reader.
The first issue of Puppet was a 
marked success. Over one thousand 
subscriptions were sold and the sale 
about school of that issue ran over 
five hundred. Many of the big news
stands sold Puppet.
Judge, the big humorous weekly, 
has published three of Puppets comic 
stories, and in one instance used a 
cut which was drawn by the Art 
Staff. This is another way that is 
bringing the name Carnegie Tech 
before the world.
Puppet is to be congratulated on 
her success and she has given us a 
word about the Puppet building 
which is to be erected very shortly. 
The Tartan will have more about it 
later.

Sincerely yoursS. H. CHURCH,
Pres. Board of Trustees. 
Letter from Dean Connelley.
That the Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology by the organization of a joint 
committee representing the studentbody and the faculty, has become a 
part of the movement among Ameri
can colleges for the relief of the suf
fering and the needy of the non-com
batants of Europe, is certainly worthy 
of the institution. No one can read 
the story of the helplessness of the 
Belgians, the Armenians, the Serb
ians, the Jews and the others of the 
innocent war-trodden people of Eu
rope without experiencing a goodly 
measure of that broad humanitarian 
feeling that must express itself in a 
practical way.
It was fortunate, indeed, for thou
sands of these people that there were 
relief agencies at hand ready to volun
teer their services. The work of the 
American Red Cross Society, although 
organized for service in belligerent 
countries, pointed out the way for re
lief for the non-combatants and made 
it possible for the various Founda
tions and endowments to do the ini
tial work. It is through such organ
ized agencies that the work must con
tinue if anything like an adequate re
lief is to be had. The movement 
among the colleges is a part of this 
organized effort.
In the early efforts in behalf of the 
Belgians, it may be said to the credit 
of American students that when the 
call came for American volunteers to 
take care of the distribution of sup
plies in that country, that thirty 
American Rhodes scholars in English 
Universities went into the work with 
characteristic student enthusiasm. 
That they acquitted themselves with 
credit goes without saying. The ap
peal now comes to us for something 
of the same active intelligent spirit 
in the matter of giving and soliciting 
gifts that the further work of relief 
mav be undertaken.
That there is immediate need for 
help is evidenced by what is authoritativelv stated of conditions in Bel
gium bv Mr. Ernest P. Bicknell, Na
tional Director of the National Red 
Cross, member of the Rockefeller 
Commission for the Relief of the Des
titute in Europe, etc., who has stud
ied conditions at first hand. Mr. Bick
nell writes. Almost one-third of the 
total population of Belgium (total) 
population approximates 7.000,000 per
sons') is now unable to buy its food 
clothing.
I feel that our boys will make an 
adequate response to this appeal and 
will back up the committee in the carrving out of its work. Personally, I 
=hall be glad to co-operate in what
ever way the committee may suggest.

Dean, School of Applied 
Industries.
Letter from E. R. Bossange.
The horrors of the war effect us 
lees and less. We have read so many 
tales of tragedy and death by the
thousands, devastation, suffering and 
outrages of every sort that our 
senses are blunted and our sympa
thies deadened. Yet this must not be> 
for the hope of lessening or avoiding 
such horrors in the future seems to 
depend on two thingsfirst, that we 
realize the magnitude of this world 
calamity and second, that our hearts 
go out to the millions of sufferers 
with a truly brotherly love and pity.
More fundamental than peace con
gresses or than treaties that may be 
signed, but not kept, are international 
friendships, undertakings and sympa
thies that make the idea of war ab
horrent to the people, to the people 
who give their lives and ruin their 
families in order to kill those they 
do not hate at the bidding of a cen
tralized power called government. If 
the people of Europe had had a fair 
chance to express their opinions I am 
sure this war would not have occur
red. The governments of Europe 
have an individuality and policy of 
their own, not always that of the 
people or for the people; aims, stand
ards and policies not determined by 
public opinion, but on the contrary, 
public opinion moulded by centralized 
power.
It is the duty of all people to lessen 
the causes of war by bringing about 
a true appreciation and understanding 
of other countries. If the nations 
could know each other well enough 
to realize that human nature after all 
is the same everywhere, that the same 
characteristics occur in each and that 
it is only outward conventions, man
ners, forms of speech and dress that 
differ, that the same ambitions and 
thoughts move the whole world, then 
a spirit of brotherhood would be 
awakened and calamities such as this 
unknown. If we can substitute this 
svmpathy for the contempt which so 
often exists nations will not in the 
future consent to jump at each others 
throats at the bidding of a govern
ment whose policv is influenced by 
secret treaties and guided by the am
bition of mere personalities.
The relief fund which you are now 
proposing to raise will have its great
est value by bringing about firsta 
more adequate realization of the mag
nitude and horror of this modern 
'alamity, and secondby opening our 
hearts and our minds to the high 
duality of other nations and inspiring 
ns to have for them a true spirit of 
brotherhood.
If it is in mv power to do anything 
to help in this admirable movement 
I shall consider it a great privilege to 
do so.
E. R. BOSSANGE.
Letter from Dean Breed.
The Margaret Morrison School has 
maintained for a number of years a 
philanthropic organization known as 
the Guild. The Guild has taken up 
each year some definite form of altru
istic activity, usually along the line of 
child welfare, the relief of tubercu
losis, or the like. This year it has 
succeeded in raising a little money by 
a Christmas Bazaar, part of which 
will be used in relief work for the 
Canadian forces to be sent to Europe. 
The Guild is interested in this phase 
of work on account of Major Frank
P. Day, one of the Margaret Morrison 
faculty, who is on leave of absence 
during the war, and to whose battalion 
the 85th Nova Scotia Highlanders, the 
School has made a present of socks.
Through the Guild, the Margaret 
Morrison School hopes to take part 
in whatever philanthropic or relief 
activities the Tech in general decides 
to support. The tradition of the 
School has always been in line with 
altruistic endeavor* and the motto of 
the Guild might well be expressed in 
come way like this: To share with 
the other person, no matter how little 
we have to share.

Letter from Dean Leete.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
Why should I help toward the re
lief of peoples on the other side of 
the world? Is not my first duty to
ward the crying needs at my very 
doors? Of what importance is the 
mere pittance I can give?
If it really were a question of my 
first duty and not of my whole duty; 
if I actually am engaged in the relief 
of the suffering and need into which 
I bump daily; in short, if the ques
tions were asked in sincerity, the 
task of answering them would be 
easyone would have but to show 
that, if we recognize any duty a re
sponsibility in this direction, it can
not logically be circumscribed by the 
Institute, by the City of Pittsburgh, 
or even by this land of ours. In these 
days of quick and cheap communica
tion, of much travel, of wide ex
change not only of commodities, but 
also of ideas, of a civilization which 
draws upon the achievements of all 
timesand of all lands, it is evident 
that no nation can live to itself alone 
that what affects a people on the 
other side of the earth also concerns 
us. It follows, then, that the true 
impulse toward helping should not be 
controlled by artificial geographical 
lines or political divisions. Least of 
all can such limits be regarded by the 
educated man, for any true education 
means broadened interests and quickened sympathies. The truths of sci
ence we appropriate to our own uses 
are the fruits of the labors of many 
men of many ages and the educated 
man holds citizenship in the world as 
well as in the particular country in 
which it happened he was born.
I am afraid that for some of us the 
lack of a disposition to give is based 
on more fundamental characteristics. 
It is not a question of why I should 
give to the Armenians, but of why 
I should give at all. It is not a lack 
of ability to give, but it is a pov
erty of spirit that has no desire to 
give. With this attitude we would 
not be philanthropists if we had bar
rels of money.
It is because giving is a real factor 
in education that I am particularly in
terested in the campaign presented in 
this issue of the Tartan. Giving as 
a habit broadens the interests and 
develops the character; a habit of 
not giving narrows the intellect and 
dwarfs character.
John H. Leete.
