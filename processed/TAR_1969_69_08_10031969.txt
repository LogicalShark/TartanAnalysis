Cancelled
The hearings for a preliminary 
injunction against last Tuesday's 
demonstrators and the construc
tion workers, which had been 
scheduled for Wednesday after
noon. were cancelled Tuesday 
morning bv the presiding judge. 
Judge Ridge.
The cancellation came after an 
inquiry by the judge to the Uni

by Judge
In view of this report, Judge 
Ridge felt that it was not neces
sary to have a hearing on a pre
liminary injunction on October 1, 
1969. He therefore cancelled the 
hearing set for that date.
Judge Ridge emphasized to the 
Universitys attorneys that in the 
event of any further difficulties on 
the campus, he was prepared to 
immediately hear an application 
for an injunction.
In the letter from the court to 
the attorneys it was reported that 
the action against the three stu
dent defendents is still pending 
and will be governed by the usual 
rules of procedure applicable to 
equity actions; for example, they 
are still obligated to file an answer 
to the complaint with 20 days.
Had the University withdrawn 
the complaint, the students would 
not have been required to file an 
answer. Since the injunction is 
still pending, the students law
yers, the American Civil Liberties 
Union, will file the complaint in 
their behalf.

Vol.l 69 ,NFoRIFo
In a close vote (14-13) with sev
eral absentions) the Faculty Sen
ate decided at an emergency 
meeting Tuesday afternoon to de
feat a motion requesting the ad
ministration to withdraw its re
quest for the injunction sought af
ter last Tuesday's demonstration. 
The vote came after an intense 
two and a half hour debate.
The original motion proposed by 
by Robert Schumacher, professor 
of physics, contained seven sup
portive statements. These state
ments, expressing the Senates 
belief that an injunction is un
desirable for the following rea
sons.
1. The presence of sheriffs 
deputies on campus for an indefi
nite period for the purpose of determing whether or not anyone is 
in any manner unlawfully imped
ing, obstructing, hampering, or 
interfering with the business of 
the said plaintiff' is undersirable 
in view of the reasonable pre
sumption that said deputies are 
unqualified to so determine. Such 
presence is a clear and distinct 
threat to academic freedom on 
the campus.
2. Obtaining an injunction is 
public admission that the Carnegie-Mellon University community 
does not expect to be able to con
duct its affairs in the future with
out supervision by the agents of 
the court.
3. Item II of the complaint is 
palpably false.
4. The plaintiffs prayer to 
limit the number of peaceful pick
ets to five at each entrance is 
probably unconstitutional. Also, if 
pickets are so limited, it consti
tutes a threat to their safety.
"5. The injunction will in no 
way increase the safety of peace
ful demonstrators who may be 
threatened by the construction 
workers.
It is undesirable for the 
University to endeavor to protect 
from danger by this means stu
dents and/or employees who will
fully and without regard to their 
own personal safety stimulate or 
create a confrontation with em
ployees of the contractor.
7. Item 4 of the Plaintiffs 
prayer is indefinite and vague. It 
tends to remove from the Univer
sity its right to conduct its peace
ful and lawful affairs without in
terference from an outside agen
cy, the courts.
The motion eventually voted 
upon was amended to read: The 
Faculty Senate requests the ad
ministration to withdraw its re
quest of the attached injunction.
After Dr. Robert Kibbee stated 
the reasons for the courts deci
sion to postpone the hearings set 
for the injunction, questions were 
directed from the floor.
Several senators felt that out
side people were not capable of 
judging unique campus situations. 
Others, in favor of the motion, in
dicated that the University com
munity should know where the ad
ministration stands on this issue. 
Stever has set up a mechanism, 
the senator stated. Weve 
agreed to it in the past. Now that 
it is put up to a test, we object 
to the rules.
Although some senators stated 
that the University should be giv
en credit for possessing instincts 
of self-preserv.ition and handdling themselves accordingly, 
others replied that 'we have giv
en students more credit for think
ing of the ramifications of their 
actions than they deserve.
Thomas Kerr explained that if 
the University gets an injunction 
it will mean that sheriff s deputies 
will be on campus. If there is an 
infraction of the injunction in their 
eyes, they will read (patiently?) 
the injunction. If it is not obeyed, 
they may arrest the violators or 
call in the police to do so. This 
shifts the option from the cap
able hands of Kibbee and Swank 
to the unknown hands of the 
Sheriff's deputies. he stated. I 
prefer to wait until the next 
situation is a dangerous one to 
get an injunction. Kerr contin
ued.  and in the cooler interim 
let Kibbee and Swank be in 
charge.
Kerr continued that the injunc
tion was very broad in its scope. 
If students want to demonstrate 
for or against topless dancers, the 
October 15 Moratorium, in effect, 
has nothing at all to do with the 
BCC, then the sheriffs deputies 
and not the University will be in 
charge of juding the nature of the 
demonstration.
Another senator indicated that 
the threat of an injunction im
plied the notion that the Universi
ty is poised to strike on the basis 
of a decision which does not lie in 
University hands. The threat 
could lead to a demonstration in 
itself, he continued.
Professor Langer, chairman of 
the Senate, directed a question to 
Dr. Schatz "How strongly does 
the administration feel it must 
pursue the injunction?
Dr. Schatz replied that no ac
tion of the Emergency Committee 
indicated that we should or should 
not pursue injunctive proceedings.
Professor Daniel Resnick indi
cated that he thought the sheriffs 
deputies could not guarantee the 
students protection against the 
construction workers. He then 
asked what the purpose of seeking 
an injunction actually was? He an
swered. stating the reason to en
join the protest is because con
struction must go on at all costs. 
I cannot see why we should press 
for an injunction, if keeping the 
construction open at all costs is 
not our goal, Resnick continued.
Dr. Kibbee replied to Prof. Res
nicks statement. He stated that 
the principle reason for seeking 
the injunction was the protection 
of the students. He said that in the 
absence of the deputies, he was 
positive there would be no pro
tection to the students. With the 
injunction, Kibbee said, there was 
a possibility for protection.
Kibbee added that it is clear 
that the University is not commited to keeping the construction 
open at all costs. He said the ad
ministration would impose a shut
down for reasons stated by Dr. 
Stever, such as violation of law 
on the sites.
One senator indicated that he 
thought that labeling the adminis
tration trigger happy was 
wrong. He said that the Tuesday 
demonstration was the first major 
disturbance of its kind at C-MU, 
and that it was handled according 
to the rules.
Students attacked the wrong in
dividuals in attacking the truck 
drivers was the comment of an
other representative. He stated 
that it is understandable why the 
driver would be upset if the ce
ment were not dumpedit could 
result in the loss of his job.
Provisions one through three of 
the motion were thought by some 
to be statements against the Uni
versity, calling for an injunction 
at any time. Others did not inter
pret them as such.
Before the final vote was taken 
a motion to table the motion inde
finitely (in fact, defeat it) was de
feated.
The Senate indicated by its fi
nal vote defeating the motion call
ing for a withdrawal of an injunc
tion that it had faith in the admin
istration and Emergency Boards 
ability to handle future demons
trations.
A motion urging the adminis
tration to press for the same in
junction if a similar situation 
arises was proposed and defeat
ed because it was thought to be 
superfluous and unnecessary, al
though most senators agreed with 
its sentiment
C-MU Gets Grant
The Howard Heinz Endow
ment has made a grant of $600.
000 to Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity to create and endow a 
Heniz Professorship of Human
ities and Social Sciences.
The grant, made to the Schools 
Fund for Distinction, allows the 
university to choose the disci
pline for the professorship with 
in the broad field of humanities. 
C-MU accepted its first fresh
man class of 124 students in 
the new school this year.

Real Sleeper
Editor. Can CoeorA
The injunction against de
monstrators and construction 
workers requested by the Uni
versity administration merits 
close attention. Although the re
quest alleges immediate da
mage unless an injunction is gran
ted, more than a week has pas
sed without any damage or repitition of the demonstrations. 
The text of the injunction refers 
to irreparable injury, loss and 
damage to its property, yet the 
administration, speaking through 
Dr. Kibbee, has asserted that the 
purpose of the injunction is rT 
to protect property but to protect 
life and limb of students and 
faculty. If this is true, the uni
versity is perjuring itself in 
court. Of course it is not true; if 
the sole aim were to protect stu
dents, the administration would 
need TruR an injunction against 
construction workers, not against 
demonstrators in addition.
The real sleeper in the text is 
the provision to limit peaceful 
and lawful picketers to five in 
number, remaining ten feet apart. 
A larger number of peaceful 
picketers would endanger neither 
property nor individuals. By 
seeking to limit the number of 
picketers, the administration real
ly intends to prevent them from 
showing that large numbers of 
individuals support, the coalition, 
not just a few. However, the sig
nificance of this provision goes 
far beyond the issue hat hand. If 
activities which are both lawful 
and in conformity with university 
regulations are to be prohibited 
when they embarass the uni
versity, clearly the Rights of 
Assembly. Expression and Aca
demic Freedom. as specified in 
school regulations, are meaning
less, because the University 
administration, at its own dis
cretion, can annul them through 
court action. In defending this 
provision against charges that is 
unconstitutional, Kibbee has 
pointed out that the Supreme 
Court has not yet ruled on this 
point. Whether constitutional or 
not, the provision is unwise and 
improper for a university, whose 
foundation is destroyed when 
peaceful free expression is limi
ted. The courts may take years to 
rule on this point; in the mean
time, students and faculty must 
be prepared to struggle against 
the administration when it seeks 
to infringe on the rights of stu
dents and faculty in this way.

What is Moral?
Editor. Can CoeorA
I have been profoundly distur
bed by recent efforts on this 
campus to make the university 
publicly support the demands 
of the Black Construction Coali
tion. At the outset, let me say that 
I personally favor the goal of 
equal employment opportuni
ties, but have grave misgivings 
about the demands of the BCC. 
in part because it is not clear to 
me that some of these (for ex
ample. the quota system in union 
membership would further the 
aforementioned goal.
However it is not to the jus
tice of the BCCs demands, im
portant though that matter is. 
that I wish to address my re
marks. Rather. I want to discuss 
some other moral and practical 
principles which appear to me to 
have been overlooked by those 
students and faculty who have 
been clamoring for the univer
sity to take sides in the dispute be
tween the unions and the BCC.
In the first place, the rather 
hasty action of bringing pres
sure on the university to take
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
sides, without any adequate time 
for a discussion of the issues in
volved, comes dangerously close 
to forcing a moral position on 
people who may not agree with 
it. I am not surprised to find 
student groups adopting these pro
cedures, since it is very much the 
style these days, and one may 
hope that a growing apprecia
tion of the subtleties of many 
moral issues is part of the educa
tional process. But it does 
grieve me that many of my fac
ulty colleagues, who cannot claim 
immaturity as an excuse, have 
been equally ready to plunge the 
university into a serious crisis on 
the basis of their strong moral 
beliefs, the sincerity of which I 
do not question, without giving 
greater consideration to the pos
sibility that there may be others 
who do not share these beliefs, pr 
at least differ as to the course of 
action which these beliefs imply, 
but who nonetheless have an equal 
interest or stake in the university 
It is no doubt true that in these 
difficult days we must be pre
pared to pay a price for our 
moral commitments if they are to 
be worth anything. I am also pre
pared to spend my resources for 
causes I believe to be just, but 
it seems to me less than moral to 
spend the resources of my neigh
bor unless I have some assur
ance that he concurs in this ac
tion.
It has, of course, been argued, 
that the university cannot avoid 
taking a position on this issue 
to quote from the resolution pas
sed by the Faculty Senate on Sep
tember 16. This type of reasonis rT at ouu new: l is quite cus
tomary hTe 6nT6un to argue that 
when an University does not 
take a 6kzulg stand on the side 
anR howTe in a controversy, it 
has, by inhokup taken a stand on 
the other dlinU This was the at
titude of aTdn who, in times all 
to recent, charged that the uni
versities ynen 76lrv: if they did 
not n;gukin ouu communist speak
ers from go'6kd and require 
their faculties to sign loyalty 
oaths. It is sad to see reflections 
of this in our Faculty Senate. I 
fear that in a practical sense our 
Senators are quite correct. Not 
because of the moral impossi
bility of remaining neutral, but 
because of the headstrong de
mands of those who are deter
mined that the University take 
a side  their side  in the cur
rent dispute.
I have previously held what is 
no doubt an oversimplified and 
idealized view of the univer
sity as a community of scholars 
(in the broad sense of the term) 
drawn together by our com
mon interest in the educational 
functions of the institution, ra
ther than by common attitudes 
towards the problems which lie 
outside those interests. It is not 
true that we are men without 
moral principles, or political in
terests, or (in some cases) religious 
commitments. But since our 
agreement is not based on a com
mon commitment outside the field 
of scholarship and educa
tion, it has seemed wise to limit 
the commitments of the instruc
tion (as ildlrg from those of 
its individual members) to 
those directly applicable to its 
scholarly functions. Such a lim
itation does not restrict the indi
vidual from associating with 
whatever outside causes he con
siders worthwhile or just; in
deed it enhances his liberty in 
such associations because there 
are then no grounds for sup
posing that his involvement im
plies the official endorsement of 
the institution (and therefore, in 
some sense, the approval of his 
fellow scholars).
Now I am assured by some of 
my colleagues that such a view
point is not only idealized, but 
thoroughly outdated. Noninvolve
ment is a thing of the past, and 
it is high time for the university 
to express its collective voice in 
the important moral issues facing 
our society, and throw its weight 
around. Clearly I am in no posi
tion to argue that my vision of 
an ideal university is super
ior to that of my activitist col
leagues. But I think is fair to ask 
them, now that we are embark
ing on moral crusades, to please 
explain the principles (if any) 
which will govern our choices of 
the issues in which we shall be
come involved. Will it be any 
time a sufficient number of stu
dents and/or faculty be
come sufficiently incensed about 
an issue to demand that some
thing be done? Will we decide 
our moral choices by majority 
vote? Shall we be concerned only 
when sums of a million dollars 
or more are involved ? This is,
I believe, an urgent problem to 
which I wish the activist faculty 
would address themselves, 
at the very least out of courtesy
to some of us who, not that the 
course, is changing, may be ser
iously wondering whether we wish 
to stay on the boat.

Editor, Can Coeor
There has been much talk of 
late concerning Nixons withdrawl of troops from Viet
nam and his reduction of draft 
calls. As with everything about 
Nixon these are simply: (1) Man
ipulation of the public through 
public relations and (2) lies.
I quote from Senator McGov
ern (Congressional Record, Vol 
115, No. 156.)
Mr. McGovern: Mr. President, 
notwithstanding the fanfare of 
the past few days, the Nixon ad
ministrations adjustments in the 
military draft will allow the sur
vival of one of this countrys 
most obvious denials of indivi
dual liberty.
Last Friday, The President 
announced what appeared to be 
a reduction of 50,000 in draft 
calls for 1969. It is to be ac
complished by canceling the De
fense Departments previously 
programmed calls of 32,000 for 
November and 18.000 for Decem
ber, and by spreading the 29.
000 October call evenly over the
3 remaining months of the year.
But the reduction is an illus
ion. In fact, without the cuts we 
would have had a massive in
crease in draft calls for the year 
as a whole.
From June through October of 
1969, the total draft quota was 
135,700, compared with only 79,
000 for the same period a year 
earlier. The inflation of nearly 
57.000 in thos five months eas
ily left room for a 50.000 reduc
tion. Total draft calls for this 
year will be only about 2 per
cent lower than in 1968.
In effect, what appears as 
benevolence to the young men 
who might have been taken in 
November and December is no 
more than an announcement that 
they will not be called then be 
cause they have already gone.
They were pressed into service 
as part of earlier quotas.
If Nixon (and our other lead
ers) continue to ignore dissent 
they will be responsible for the 
unnecessary violence that will 
follow. To ignore the burning of 
a draft card is to ask for the burn
ing of buildings.

Media Panned
To The Editor;
A recent correspondence to the 
Tartan states: the mass media 
have taken pains to portray the 
demonstration as unfavorably as 
possible, and views with some 
concern the bad publicity the uni
versity hence received.
I must state my lack of con
cern for the opinions of the mass 
media and of the public in gen
eral. These act with such consis
tent hypocrisy and self-interest 
(KDKAs vendetta over an in
significant incident) as to in
validate themselves as justified 
observers of my actions or those 
of the University.

But. it will be argued, an 
university, even if it can avoid 
taking sides on issues in the com
munity. has a clear moral and le
gal obligation for what happens 
on its own property. This I be
lieve to be true. If there is rea
son to believe that the con
tracts for buildings now being 
erected are not being kept, of 
course an investigation followed 
by appropriate legal action is 
in order. But even here some 
limits ought to be observed in 
considering the Universitys ob
ligations to police our own ter
ritory. The sword has more than 
one edge. Shall we beef up the 
campus police force to insure that 
laws on alcoholic beverages are 
strictly adhered to at frater
nity parties? Or that visiting 
hours (made suitably strict) are 
not violated in the dormitories? 
1 myself favor Thomas Kerrs 
position, that a university policy 
of lr uTgT 6oenrld should be 
abandoned But I wonder if it is 
altogether consistent to say that 
while we will not police the 
morals of our own students, we 
are very much going to police 
the morals and practices of the 
union hall.

October Moratorium Planned 'A/lame' rc dynp 
Core Classes To Be Given
A group of C-MU students and 
faculty have held three meetings 
to discuss the Oct. 15 moratorium 
and are at work this week finaliz
ing a program for that day.
The moritorium concept was 
first formulated at the national 
level and was seen as a case of 
taking time off from school to 
conduct activities aimed at ending 
the war. The plan calls for one day 
in October, two in November, 
three in December, and so on. 
Meetings regarding Pittsburgh 
participation were held as early 
as July. The group at C-MU held
ATTENTION:

its first meeting about three 
weeks ago. At that meeting it was 
decided: (1) Those people who 
worked on the project at C-MU 
would decide what would be done 
rather than following the lead of 
any national group. (2) No deci
sion would be made about the fol
lowing month, rather the group 
would decide about one months 
activities at a time. (3) The cam
pus situation warrants the atten
tion of such activity (as opposed 
to off-campus work). (4) The day 
will be planned as day of educa
tion and billed as an alterna
tive university.
Plans are uncertain, but discus
sion at the last meeting centered 
around which classes would be of
fered. The major voice wanted to 
see five or six core areas, each to 
be taught (which means discus
sion leading) by someone from the 
University who has a background 
in taht area. Examples discussed 
at the meeting were: the Vietnam 
War and history; the draft, con
scription, and resistance; campus 
connections with the military-in
dustrial complex; cybernetics/ 
ABM/CBW/The Bomb etc., 
and Where Can We Go to Do 
Something About All This? In 
addition there will be a rally on 
the cut and perhaps a main speak
er. Further plans will be made at 
the meeting Monday at 7 p.m. in 
Skibo 45. Students of faculty who 
are interested but not able to at
tend should contact Thomas Bur
gess at 521-9178.
The groups main consideration 
now is finding a way to notify the 
campus community that the day
of education exists. There is a 
feeling that attendance at an al
ternative university will be very 
large even if the administration 
fails to cancel classes for that 
day. The campus situation, the in
terest of the freshman class, and 
the activities of last week have led 
mandy to feel that C-MU is right 
for his type of activity.
A Publicity Committee was ap
pointed and anyone else who could 
help in that respect is asked to 
contact one of the following peo
ple, Coeor (T. Burgess, 521- 
9128), WRCT (,arru Welsch. 421- 
1887), Posters (Drew Silver. 687- 
3816), Leaflets (Howard Richman, 661-7202), Courses (John 
Agatston, 682-8926), Printing ar
rangements (Pete Georgiades, 682- 
9421).
The timeless show business 
adage the show must go on has

The fascination which the work 
of Berthold Brecht has opon the
ater audiences was readily appar
ent in the Drama Department 
Senior Project of Brecht on 
Brecht. This montage of sound, 
whether taped, sung, or recited, 
provided considerable variation 
on Brechts work and received a 
wealth of emotional reaction.
George Tabori has compiled a 
series of Brechts prose, poetry, 
songs, recordings, and scenes 
which enables a director to best 
express his art. Denny Stevens un
dertook such a task upon directing 
Brecht on Brecht. The credit 
and criticism of this production 
rest on the shoulders of Miss Stev
ens. She has placed the players in 
the laps of the audience and has 
achieved a remarkable sense of 
rapport with literary material that 
is far from close to the specta
tors. She has ripped and wrought 
an interpretation with the delicate 
touch of a child for she chose to 
slap us in the face rather than 
kick us below the belt. Brechts 
treatment of Nazi Germany 
ed a sense of reminiscence in an 
audience too young to recall Hit
lers regime.
The vicious years and mass ter
ror of war could easily drain both 
cast and audience, but Brecht on 
Brecht was artfully paced with 
satire and song. Although the be
ginning of the show was rather 
heavy and tended to confuse those 
not familiar with Brechts style, 
the lighter moments immediately 
lifted those losing interest. Kurt 
Weills must was given a clever 
twist by William Chrystal who 
handled the musical arrange
ments and acted as piano accom
panist. He established a musical 
black-out pattern of sound during 
one segment of satire and brought 
relevance to the sticky Brecht.
Soug Krantzs lighting was ef
fective, but my directorial eyes 
sensed the lack of tonal color that 
have heightened the moods of varous scenes. Nonetheless, the hotwhite lighting was used to its full
est by fade-outs and half lighting 
techniques.
The cast needs no minute delination of criticism. They were fully 
aware of their better moments of 
acting. This was apparent since 
they remained in the wings and 
responded to each others work. 
During weaker scenes, the cast 
not on stage couldnt be found. I 
must note that the tempo of the 
production was remarkable. We 
were never left searching for the 
cast.
Even the voice of Brecht him
self was audible above the crackl
ing old tapes. Since this was a di
recting project, it was under
standable that particular seg
ments lacked a full three-dimensional perspective by the actors, 
but each of the six members did. 
indeed, have a memorable scene.
Brecht on Brecht succeeded 
as the first in the series of Studio 
Directing Projects for the 1969- 
70 Drama Department attempt. I 
was there and, in retorspect, hap
pily so.

Those in our generation were 
born and raised in the icy shadow 
of the bomb. There are some who 
feel that this constant threat of 
nuclear war is a dominant factor 
in our behavior. Though most of 
our days pass without a conscious 
thought being given to our brass 
buttoned beaurocratic bretheren 
in the Pentagon and the incredible 
things they could do with but a 
flick of a finger (how symbolic), 
every now and then we get a 
shocking reminder of where our 
ever-helpful technology might take 
us.
The War Game is an English 
film which was designed to illus
trate the possible effects of nu
clear attack on England. It was 
scheduled to appear as a special 
on the BBC but was mysteriously 
cancelled for reasons which were 
never made clear. It was even
tually released in the U.S. as a 
feature and I assure you, the im
pact of this film is absolutely de
vastating.
The War Game is done in docu
mentary form and continually 
points to the hopeless plight of 
the innocent population. The evacucation plan to be employed in 
England is entirely inadequate 
with no provisions whatsoever for 
able bodied males over the age of 
18. Families would be forced, by 
law, to house and feed up to eight 
extra people for an undefined 
length of time. It was found that 
the general population has almost 
no knowledge at all concerning 
civil defense plans, protection
from radiation, or anything else 
pertaining to nuclear war.
The immediate effects of the 
initiat blast would be disastrous. 
Fire Storms would be cjated 
in which a two mile area would be 
completely ablaze. The heat at the 
center would become so intense 
that it would eat up all the ozygen 
in the area and create winds of up 
to 100 mph, sucking people into 
the fire. I think it worthy of note, 
at this point, to mention that the 
ideas presented in The War Game 
are not just theories.Most of them 
were taken directly from events 
which took place in Hiroshima, 
Nagasaki, and Dresden. Equally 
astonishing is the following fact: 
when asked if he was in favor of 
retaliation for retaliations sake,
the man on the street answered 
with an overwhelming yes.
It is important that as many 
people as possible see this film 
and react to it in their own private 
way. The issues of Vietnam, the 
Coalition, poverty and the culture 
void are important, but how can 
you even think about them when 
this thing is looming over your 
head? The only answer to this 
kind of insanity is the scraping of 
all nuclear arms. Everyone real
izes that this would be a terribly 
complicated proceedure, but it 
must be donenow. There will un
doubtedly be survivors in a nu
clear attack, but I wonder if they 
will envy the dead?
to happen in Chicago. He soon wa 
out in the streets with an idea and 
a camera which captured the spir
it and meaning of the Chicago 
Massacre.
But to say that this movie is 
about Chicago would make it a 
documentary. Medium Cool tells 
more about the current state of 
our culture than any isolated inci
dent might convey. This is accom
plished by watching individuals 
and their problems in the setting 
of the turmoil of Chicago, 1968.
Although the cast is a collection 
of relative unknowns from the 
pits of theatrical obscurity, they 
handled their roles quite profes
sionally. Most notable from the 
casting standpoint was Verna 
Bloom, selected for the role of a 
hillbilly wife in the big city. Miss 
Bloom delivered a truly great per
formance.
At certain points this script was 
ambiguous and incoherent, but the 
sharp photography compensated 
for any loss at such moments. The 
film contained great lengths of un
edited footage of the Chicago con
frontation. The visual experience 
alone told much of the story.
Medium Cool is now playing at 
the Squirrel Hill Theatre. It is a 
must for serious students of 
American politics and culture.
A Black Briefcase was found 
to be missing from the book 
depository at the Bookstore. 
In addition to a post versalog slide-rule and an Aigol 
text, the briefcase contained 
approximately three weeks 
worth of critical lab data.

a briefcase and its contents please

by CLAUDIA WOLFE, 
VRBvYrBC. VICoBAABCYF TlNCFYA
Panhellenic Council welcomes c 
all girls to our first formal open 
house on Sunday. October 5. 
from 1-4:30 p.m.
This is a good opportunity to 
meet Greek women. Of course, 
there is no obligation to pledge 
or even go through second sem 
ester rush; however, if you might 
wish to join a sorority you must 
have attended either this open j 
house or the one coming up in 
November. There is nothing that 
can be lost and so much to gain 
from a sorority.
For example, C-MU is unique 
in that it is a small school with 
a tremendously varied student 
population. Sororities take this 
diversity and blend it into a grou$ 
of girls who not only have fun 
together but have mutual respect ' 
and understanding for one an
other. Sorority women share them
selves and their talents with 
each other thereby enriching 
and broadening one another. 
They stress interpersonal rela
tions and teach the excitement of 
learning about and being with 
other people. Through this mech
anism it is felt that a girl can 
come to better know herself and 
be a more successful member of 
society. It is through the group 
that each girl emerges as an in
dividual. In other words, soror
ities are not stereotyped and do 
not create stereotypes, rather 
they help girls develop into their 
potential self.
What else do sororities do? 
Why do they differ from other 
groups of just friends? Sorority 
sisters do do many of the same 
things that any group of friends 
do. They study together, work 
together, watch TV, and have 
fun together; they even cry on 
each others shoulders. Also, they 
have parties, produce skits, and 
involve themselves in service 
projects. Yet, they are dif
ferent. There exists an intangible 
something else. It is this 
 something else that is so diffi
cult to describe that makes a 
sorority a sorority and not just 
a group of friends.
Do you want to find out more? 
Come and  meet the Greeks 
Sunday afternoon.

Dying Service RevivedALSAC To Receive
Phi Tau Gamma has been eu
phemistically described as a serv
ice honorary. That any service 
has been performed by Phi Taa 
Gammans in recent years is 
doubtful. Steered by apathetic 
leaders among the junior women 
and peopled by apathetic mem
bers, the sorority had almost giv
en up the ghost until this years 
crop of members took over. Led 
by President Marci Hallman and 
advised by Dean Lloyd of MMCC 
and Frank Colissimo of the Study 
Skills Center, this years mem
bership of Phi Tau Gamma hopes 
to revive the groups function on 
campus so that this year is not 
its last.
The basic function of the soror
ity being the tutoring of freshman 
women, a committee for tutoring 
has already been established with
in the group structure, led by Lin
da Rye, Carol Weinrib, Helen 
Trop, Barbara Brenneman and Su
san Clopper. The committees 
recommendation will be offered 
to the sorority at its next meeting 
on Oct. 14, and the project will 
swing into action immediately. It 
is hoped that the womens honor
ary will be able to work closely 
with its male counterpart. Delta 
Skull, in the tutoring of both men 
and women, and reaching all de
partments of the University.
The sorority has discussed sev
eral methods of approaching frosh 
who need help in studying, examtaking and time-budgeting. A pro
jected tea before mid-terms for 
the frosh will enable them to meet 
the tutors and discuss general 
problems. Frank Collsimo has of
fered his aid and that of his office 
in teaching the tutors the basics 
of tutoring, and also for helping 
the freshmen themselves. Notice
On Nov. 4 and 5, the Gamma Sig 
vampires will strike again, this 
time in the Morewood Recreation 
Room. For those of you who don
ated a pint last year, please give 
another. This pint can cover some 
of your other loving relatives who 
are not presently covered. Your 
consent slip is still good.
For those of you who do not 
know about the blood drive, let me 
explain somewhat. For the small 
price of one pint of your blood, you 
receive coverage for yourself, 
parents, parents-in-law, spouse.
and lists of names will also be 
posted in the dorms, and fresh
men will be addressed separately 
through the mail.
Phi Tau Gamma could be a suc
cessful and needed campus or
ganization. If. however, the group 
follows in the ways of its pre
decessors, there will be no Phi 
Tau Gamma Junir Womens Hon
orary in years to come.
children and unmarried borthers 
and sisters. You also get free 
food (juice and donuts) after you 
give your pint. If you are under 
21, you will need your parents or 
guardians permission.
If you are unable to give a pint 
at this time, you will be covered 
until the next drive. Also, if you 
are permanently unable, you will 
be covered, although we would ap
preciate you finding a substitute 
donor.
Please help. Send you schedule 
of free hours on Nov. 4 and 5 to 
Box 24. Gamma Sigma Sigma, so 
that we can make an appointment 
for you. For further information,

lost their final two games by 
forfeit. SAE sent their game in
to overtime against BTP when Fer

less than a minute left to go. 
BTP took the lead in the over

running of QB Ken Mikus, 
but SAE came back to win 
when Beaumont hit Kovalik

In their opener, the Tartansopener,
amassed 414 total yeards, led by 
Terry Bells 183 yards rushing. 
However, the offense lost the ball 
three times on fumbles and 
twice on interceptions to kill a 
number of potential scoring drives. 
Tom Lombardo is still a doubt
ful starter. Defensive end John 
Hastings and safetyman Bill 
Halsted were injured in last 
weeks contest and are also doubt
ful starters.
Oberlin was victimized by fum
bles in their defeat last week too. 
Yoemen coach Bill Grace has 
twenty returning lettermen from 
last years^ team including co
captains Fred Minnear (Of
fensive center and linebacker) 
and halfback Jim Fabian. Dan 
Duffey is back for his third year 
at quarterback for the Yoemen.
CMUs opening game loss re
vealed essentially what had been 
expected. An inexperienced de
fensive unit, with five freshmen 
in the starting lineup, was un
able to stop the powerful Thiel 
attack. On offense, the Tar
tans got an outstanding game from 
Bell, and fine performances from 
Dzura, the entire offensive line, 
and freshman receiver Char
ley Price, who caught six passes 
for 114 yards and a touchdown.
The teams have met seven 
times in the past with Oberlin 
holding a 4-2-1 edge. Since the 
series was resumed in 1966.
however, the Yoemen have not 
won, while the Tartans have scor
ed two victories to go with last 
years tie.
