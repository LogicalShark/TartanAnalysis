VOL. II, No. 37 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JUNE 17, 1908 TEN CENTS
F.kBLdY B.St B.LL dt.i
The readers of the Tartan will undoubt
edly be interested in the redoubtable aggrega
tion of ball players that Captain and Manager 
Dorsey has signed on the Faculty base-ball 
team. They are given herewith in the order 
in which they appear and strike terror to the 
opposing pitcher. Every man of them while 
at school played on either his class or school 
team, and one of them has played in profes
sional ball. Lightcap, center field, leads the 
batting list. He played on his class team at 
Pennsylvania and could now be playing profes
sional ball if he would consent to shave off his 
mustache, but he steadily refuses to do so, 
having not yet been convinced that a smooth 
shaven face is-necessary to a ball player.
Smith, left field, and number two also 
played on his class team while at U. of P. He 
plays base-ball as he attacks Calculus in a cold 
calculating sort of way that produces results 
and leaves the other fellow wondering how 
he did it. He has only caused one ripple in 
the placid pool of Faculty athletics. He flatly 
refuses to play in a uniform in which there is 
no left trousers pocket in which to hook his 
thumb. This defect has been remedied, how
ever, we are glad to say.
Sillreceiver of the twisterssays we 
erred when we credited him with playing on 
Princetons Varsity. We are sure, however,
that if he didnt, it was because he didn't re
ceive a proper try-out. To see him at work 
is to see Bresnahan minus the shinguards with 
the soft pedal on.
Reedwho does more damage to the 
grass around second base than any other short
stop in this vicinityplayed on Lehigh and 
might now be leading a team of his own if it 
were not for total inability to the kind of En
glish that puts men out of games.
DoseyFirst base and captainheld 
down a position in the Tristate League and left 
it not because he loved base-ball less, but be
cause foundry work paid better. With his 
partner on second, who follows him in the bat
ting list, he makes the district between first 
and second forbidden territory for safe hits.
CrabtreeMassachusetts Institute of 
Technologycertainly lost one of her stars 
when she lost him. He held down his Varsity 
position against all comers while at Boston, 
and after leaving school has always managed 
to have some sort of a ball team at every place 
he has been employed. It is commonly said 
that one of his stock questions of an applicant 
for employment is what do you play, out or 
infield?

THE TARTAN
ADVICE TO MECHANICAL ENGINEER
ING STUDENTS ABOUT TO LEAVE
THE FINSBURY TECHNICAL COL
LEGE.
(Continued from last week.)
Under the apprenticeship system of th^ 
Middle Ages a man learning his trade lived 
with his master almost like a servant; it was a 
friendly kind of relationship, and the master 
taught him his whole trade; probably in th? 
end he married his masters daughter and suc
ceeded to the business. That system is now 
disappearing, except in some few parts of Eng
land ; at Sheffield, for instance, it still survives 
in a very modified form. But, of course, when 
a master has many hundreds of hands at the 
present day, a boy is pitchforked into the 
works, and it is nobodys duty to teach him 
anything. I wish I had time to dwell on my own 
experience as an apprentice, rising gradually 
from three shillings a week in the first year, as 
duly noted in my indentures, by a shilling a 
week for seven years. Suffice it to say that I 
do not see why, wTith your training, you should 
not gain in two and a half or three years the 
skill and knowledge which the ordinary un
trained boy, with much want of self-respect, 
and very often with harsh treatment from 
everybody, takes seven years to acquire.
It is usual now, when a young man does 
not enter works as an ordinary apprentice 
is very often in these days not indenturedfor 
him to enter as an articled pupil, paying a pre
mium. In civil engineering, and many other 
professions, I think that there is no great ob
jection to this system ; but in mechanical en
gineering I think it a frightful mistake. No 
doubt there arc numerous exceptions to what 
I shall say. There are some young men who 
cannot be spoiled; but, as a rule, the articled 
pupil has the right to loaf around as he 
pleases. He is not earnest in his work; he ex
presses small regret when he Breaks valuable 
tools or soils his work. He has high and 
mighty notions of his own importance; he can
not use his hands, but, in his own opinion, he 
can out-superintend any circus manager. He 
is afraid of dirty work; he is altogether out of 
sympathy with the workmen from whom alone 
he can learn his trade, and in most cases he 
has to try to learn some other profession at
the end of his apprenticeship.
And now, at last, I have come to the ad
vice which I have to give you. You must en
ter a general engineering shop at once. You 
must find such a shop where you will be taken 
without premium for two or two and a half 
years. You will find that masters have a 
prejudice against young men coming from a 
college. We are gradually living this preju
dice down. But there it is, and it must be 
taken into account. I have had it myself when 
I have been a manager or an employer, for the 
young man from a college is often a frightful 
nuisance in a shop. You must not only pav 
no premium, but you must get some wages, 
however small, from the beginning; for if yon 
are in receipt of wages you will at all events 
try to be worth your pay, and you will have a 
very valuable feeling of responsibility. Those 
of you who have most money to spare will de
rive most benefit in following this advice. The 
father of an old pupil came to me once, and al
most with tears in his eyes, begged me to let 
his son enter works, paying a premium, as the 
son would not do it without my consent, and I 
refused.

every way. Indeed, the analogy to Pittsburgh's 
third baseman is perfect, as he has tried, but 
unsuccessfully, to be shifted to outfield, claim
ing the infield was too strenuous for him. He 
played his college ball at Wittenburg, jumping 
from there to the outlaws and finally deserting 
them to accept a position exposing the young 
idea to mathematics in its most virulent form.

will be through no fault of his.
Pfoutspitcherwho is relied on to stem 
the tide if Leete fails, is invaluable on the 
coaching line and also is capable of giving an 
account of himself with the stick.
COLLEGIANS WIN.
Our base-ball has certainly been going 
some lately, and now they certainly look like 
the base-ball team they gave promise of being 
last fall. The game last Saturday has been 
recognized by all the sporting writers to be 
the best college base-ball played in this vicin
ity this season.
Sensational fielding featured the game, 
aside from the pitching. Slocum, for Tech, 
cut off a runner at home by a fine throw, which 
saved the game, and Dick Nuttall saved it for 
the Collegians with a throw home from left. 
Blen speared a line drive with one hand and 
made a double unassisted when Tech had men 
on second and third and no outs. Lytle, in 
middle, had ten put outs and half of these were 
catches of balls which if they had gotten away, 
would have gone for extra bases.
The Collegians scored in the first inning. 
Lytle made a good running catch of Kenney's 
fly, and then Harry Murphy gave an exhibi
tion of sprinting by beating Burgins throw to 
first. Duffy fanned, but George scored Mur
phy with a drive into middle. George walked 
Kirk in the third and Slocum sacrificed. Burn
side fanned, but Barclay singled, scoring Kirk. 
There was no more scoring until the 13th in
ning. McKinleys error let Kennoy, the first 
batter up, get on safely. Murphy sacrified and 
Lytle saved the game for the time being by 
going back and collecting Duffys wallop that 
looked like a home run. This took some of 
the enthusiasm out of the Collegians rooters, 
But George came to the front with a slashing 
two-bagger which counted the Georgetown 
man.
Tech, however, did not quit. After Slo
cum and Burnside had struck out Barclay was

FOOT-BALL SCHEDULE.
Manager Meldrim Buck Thomson has 
at last completed his schedule, and by 
glancing at it one can see that Tech plays the 
best in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio. Had 
it not been for the delay encountered in secur
ing our new athletic field, we would unques
tionably have had some of the Eastern schools 
booked for next fall. Under the able coaching 
of Bill Knox, of Yale, Tech will have the great
est team in her history and the students can 
look back in after years to the time when W. 
U. P. first went down in defeat before the 
mighty foot-ball aggregation of Tech. With 
Eugene Wink Dowling captaining the team, 
it can be said without fear of contradiction 
that Tech has the most able leader in Western 
Pennsylvania. Tis unnecessary to tell of the 
doings of this valiant leader, and with the ma
jority of last years team back and new men 
coming in, we can not fail to have a successful 
season.

The Tartan takes this opportunity of bid
dinggood-bye to the fellows, and while we are 
glad that some have been able to complete the. 
course', we are sorry that there will be some 
faces absent when we assemble next fall. Ow
ing to business depression there will not be so 
ltiany positions available and a great many will 
be compelled to take a plain, everyday job. 
However, that is a misfortune that is not irre
parable, and by the time school opens in the 
fall we hope all our graduates will have been 
placed.

FIRST DAY OF SENIOR WEEK.
The first day of Senior Week has passed 
successfully with two events on the card, one 
informal and the other, formal.
About fifty students, not all of which were 
Seniors, took part in the first annual bath at 
the Oakland Natatorium. The line of march 
led from the School buildings over past the 
Library to Oakland, with the students furnish
ing their own music. After about two hours 
O? lively sport in the water, most of the stu
dents left, though some wisely came out after 
ab<jut fifteen minutes, and it was well that

they did so, as the effects were slightly visible 
at the Ball.
The Ball proved to be the most successful 
social event of the season, and was thoroughly 
enjoyed by the students and their friends, the 
faculty being well represented. The Grand 
March was led by President Henderson and 
Mrs. A. A. Hamerschlag, and was finished 
about nine-thirty. Supper was served in the 
Rittenhouse dining room at midnight, and the 
dance was over . Every one was well pleased 
and the committee came in for its share in the 
general good time and was congratulated on 
every hand.
--------o--------
WHITE FRIARS PLAY.
The play All in a Dormitory, given last 
evening at the Alvin Theater by the White 
Friars, Avas a decided success. The fellows 
seemed to be a little too self-conscious in the 
first act, but they can be excused, as the bunch 
of pretty girls in the boxes were enough to turn 
any mans head. The second act went much 
better, however, Gibson scoring a hit as Hein
rich Hohenblitz.
M. M. Steen and C. F. Borschneck made 
good with their dancing and the latter un
doubtedly made the best looking girl in the 
show. R. H. Horton as Dick Coyne was a 
trifle stiff, while A. K. Silvernail and his differ
ential dog Walter were good. Mr. Silver
nail got off a few good jokes at the expense of 
the faculty. The song Honk, Honk, was 
funny and Keep Your Eye on Uncle has a 
swing that will be remembered. At the close 
of the performance Mr. Edmundson was ten
dered an ovation by the Club and audience.
--------o--------
FACULTY WINS GAME.
The faculty succeeded in winning the an
nual Faculty-Senior Game yesterday by the 
score of 104. The Seniors showed the ef
fects of lack of practice, as their playing wras 
very ragged.

THE TARTAN
(Continued from page 4.)
Here, then, on your leaving the college 
you hav something to do which will test your 
fitness to become engineers. . Talk with any 
experienced man on this subject, and he will 
tell you that it is impossible for you to obtain 
the sort of work I speak of; and now I say that 
an engineer is :t man who often attempts to do 
what other people say is impossible. You 
must interview masters and managers and 
foremenyou must not feel so disheartened 
after twenty failures but that you can go to the 
twenty-first shop as gaily as to the first. I say 
to you that it is quite possible for you to ob
tain it. Some old Finsbury students have 
tried shops all the way from London to Leith 
before succeeding. Here are letters from 
nearly all my old Finsburg students; most of 
them describe their difficulties and their great 
appreciation of a good job when they obtained 
it. Here is a letter from one of our best stustudents of last year; he stayed two months at 
home in the country, writing innumerable let
ters. I convinced him that he could never 
succeed in this way, and then he went off on 
his personal search for work, and after several 
disappointing days at last obtained just such a 
job as T have described. Any one of you who 
fails to succeed in this quest may rest satisfied 
that he has too little fortitude, courage, and 
patience to become a successful engineer. And 
you need not think that in this persistent and 
modest search for the only kind of work which 
can complete your education you are wanting 
in manliness. We do not think a member of 
Parliament wanting in manliness when Ihe can
vasses a constituency. Almost every old Fins
bury student has succeeded in this quest which 
so many people have told them is an absurd 
one. (Here Professor Perry read extracts 
from numerous letters from old students, de
scribing. their work. Some of them are pre
paring for Whitworth scholarships or engineer
ing degrees in the Royal University of Ireland. 
'All of them were enthusiastic as to the result 
of their following the above instructions.) It 
is not good to get work too easily, as you will 
not appreciate correctly such a job as I have 
spoken of unless it is the result of a number of 
personal applications.
And now as to your behaviour in the 
shops. Remember that your aim is to learn

all that workmen can teach you. There must 
be no shirking of hard work, or rough work, 
or dirty work, no fear of working overtime 
should it be necessary; you must welcome a 
sudden call for unusual exertion as a new and 
valuable experience. Remember, too, that you 
must learn from the men; who else is there to 
teach you the trade? Now some of these men 
are ignorant of theory, many of them are pre
judiced in curious ways, but don't fall into the 
common mistake that because a workman has 
not read much, and knows but little of thermo
dynamics, that therefore he is an ignorant man. 
I knew a man who could barely read or write 
who was one of the cleverest engineers I ever 
knew. No one so valuable as he in a break
down of an engine. He could take indicator 
cards and set almost any kind of valve motion 
with an instinctive preception of what it was 
just right to do, which always excited my ad
miration. If you treat workmen sympatheti
cally you will find that, as a rule, they are very 
good men, good citizens, trying their best to 
make the world better, and helping each other 
to quite an extraordinary extent. But if you go 
among them as if you were china and they 
were crockery ; if you put on side and swag
ger about your poor, pitiful, theoretical knowl
edge ; if you let them see that you come of bet
ter blood ; if you scorn them because your fam
ilies are well-to-do in the world; if, in fact, you 
do not let it be seen in all your actions that you 
regard them as men and superiorsfor be sure 
they are your superiors until you acquire their 
skill and knowledgethen you may bid good
bye to all idea of help from them, and you may 
bid goodbye to the idea that you will ever be 
able to lead men, either as a foreman or man
ager of works. If you want to see all their 
evil qualities, threat them as inferiors; if you 
want to see all their good qualities, treat them 
as sympathetically as if they were really of 
your own flesh and blood. Of course there are 
black sheep among them, as there are some 
black sheep among yourselves, but remember 
that none of them is as black as you will think 
him to be. The advice I am giving you I never 
needed myself.. I never came in contact with 
decently skillful workman without feeling his 
superiority to myself ; and I seldom meet any 
man who does not impress me in some direc
tion with his superiority to myself, and I have

WL IMIJ11
never regretted letting such a man know, in 
some unobtrusive way, what I thought of him.
As for study, keep up your reading if pos
sible. It is so very difficult to read after a 
hard day's workI used often to go to sleep 
over my booksthat I regard men who go to 
evening classes as quite exceptional men. But 
keep up your reading as much as possible. As 
to the cultivation of your imaginations, I am 
sorry to think that young men of twenty years 
ago were in a better position than you. Thev 
had read novels and poetry, they danced, and 
were fond of music. It is rather useless to 
give advice to you on this head.
There is one very important matter on 
which I wish to touch, and then I shall have 
done. Some of you intend, I think, to try for 
scholarships at certain more advanced engin
eering colleges, so as to proceed with your col
lege studies for another three years. Xow I 
want you to understand that I appreciate at 
their proper high value the temptations offered 
youto obtain scholarships, to get an ad
vanced, thorough, mathematical training; to
work in Professor -------s laboratory, and listen
to bis teaching. To men like you and me . 
these are very great temptations; but let me 
tell you that these temptations ought not to be 
yielded to. Your ages are now on an average 
seventeen years. If you enter the shops now 
you can become good workmen; but if you 
enter shops/at the end of another three years 
and without entering shops how is it possible 
to become mechanical engineers?you will 
not be able to learn, it will be too late to make 
boys of yourselves at the ages of twenty, or 
twenty-one, or twenty-two years. Having 
had a most perfect theoretical training, to put 
yourselves meekly and modestlv under the or
ders of a workman; to accept his statements 
without a little sneering or verbal protest; at 
an age when you will be thinking of love-mak
ing and dressing like a masher;" to roughen 
your hands in cloing coarse, dirty work; the 
thing is impossible! Why even I, at the age 
of fifteen, with nobody to advise me, found 
that I could not become a good workman for 
this sort of reason, because I had a pitiful little 
knowledge of mathematics, and chemistry, and 
physics, and held myself above my work, and 
greatly have I regretted it since. No; I advise you to go at once to works, and at the end 
of two or three years get one good session's
teaching from Professor------. Think of going
to his magnificent laboratorv with your present 
equipment, and in addition a real knowledge 
of actual work. You will learn more in one 
session after your training in the works than 
you can learn now in three, and you will have 
learnt besides to be a thoroughly good work
man, at the only time of your life when such 
a thing is possible.
