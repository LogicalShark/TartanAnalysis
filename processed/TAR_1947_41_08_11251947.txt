TecvetsMove to Regain 
Old Place on Campus
Steiner Expected To Assume Leadership 
Of Nucleus That Will Rebuild Organization
Henderson To 
Perform For 
Junior Prom
Moving toward regaining its lost position and prestige on campus, 
Tecvets will hold a reorganization meeting Thursday, December 4, 
at 4:30 p. m. in room EH 218.
At this meeting, Commander Harry Thor is expected to turn 
over the reins of the organization to Jack Steiner, leader of a group 
which is forming the nucleus for the rebuilding of the CIT veterans 
organization.
Appealing prominently on the agenda will be the request made 
by the University of Kansas veterans organization to back a move 
which would ask Congress to raise subsistence allowances to $75 
and $105. f
Basic problems of should we 
continue Tecvets and what should 
be the purposes and objectives of 
the organization will, however, be 
the central theme of the meeting.
Expecting a good turnout, Jack 
Steiner will see what interest 
there would be in Tecvet athletic 
teams and sound out the mem
bers on the establishment of a 
political organization prepara
tory to presenting a slate for the 
coming Student Council election.
As far as social affairs go, 
were a little handicapped, he 
explained, as the social calendar 
is full for the coming year.
When questioned about the 
possibility of the organization be
ing largely concerned with na
tional affairs, Steiner replied 
promptly, Students dont have 
any time for that. They have one 
devil of a time keeping up with 
their studies as it is.
Harry Thor, retiring com
mander, agreed with Steiner that 
the primary purpose of the first 
meeting will be to find out if 
there is enough interest to con
tinue Tecvets.
He also had a parting note of 
advice.
On the basis of my experience, 
whether or not Tecvets will work 
depends largely upon Steiners 
program. The veterans must get 
something out of it for them
selves. Thus they will back sub
sistence petitions, hacking at Skibo prices, and other issues which 
affect them personally.
' But these topics wont be 
enough to fill monthly meetings.
And unless a good social or other 
type of program is set up, there 
wont be any meetings.
Junior Prom, the first all-school 
dance of the season with a bigname band, will be held Saturday, 
December 6, in the mens gym. 
Skitch Henderson and his orches
tra will provide the music for the 
dance. The dance will be from 
nine until one, and dress will be 
informal.
Skitch Henderson, who at one 
time was heard on the Bing Cros
by radio show, has made a name 
for himself through his many out 
standing recordings, the best 
known being Miserlou."
The Henderson band feels quite 
at home in Pittsburgh because of 
its several recent engagements in 
this area. Vocalist Nancy Reed 
nas even more reason to like 4 
Steel City; she is a native of Pitts
burgh and a graduate of TaylorAllderdice High School.
Plans are being made for 
program of entertainment during 
the intermission at the dance. In 
addition to this, Delta Skull, the 
junior mens honorary, and Sci 
mitar, mens honorary of the soph
omore class, will make their calls, 
and the Joe Pash Award for the 
best Tartan football player of the 
year will be presented by the Phi 
Kappa Fraternity.
Tickets for the prom will sell 
for $3.00 per couple, tax included

Reveals Alumni Sharing 
Views On Varsity Sport
Characterizing the revision 
of Carnegie Techs curriculum 
as nothing less than an awak
ening to a new educational life 
an upsurge of a new attitude 
with respect to our educational 
programs in all colleges,  Dr. 
Doherty addressed the student 
body at the annual Carnegie 
Day exercises held at 11:00 
a. m. today in the Music Hall.
The new plan for Carnegie 
Day, which provides for a speech 
by the President on topics of im
mediate interest to the students, 
also gave Dr. Doherty an oppor
tunity to review CITs policy on 
intercollegiate football, as he in
dicated that the alumni are now 
gradually coming to share the 
view that the only way to skin 
the cat of Class A football is to 
sacrifice the education and thus 
the professional careers of stu
dents who play on the team.
This We Will Not Do
This, said the president, em
phatically, we will not do. 
Injecting a personal segment 
into his speech as a means of fur
ther explaining the revised Car
negie Day program, the president 
pointed out to the students who 
rarely see him and therefore con

that he is nevertheless in there

Omicron Delta Kappa Initiates 
Commentator Martin Agronsky
Commentator Martin Agronsky has accepted the invitation of 
the Carnegie Tech chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa to be initiated 
into membership at its annual fall ceremony in the Carnegie Union 
December 1.
Martin Agronsky, Washington news analyst for the American 
Broadcasting Company, will be in Pittsburgh next week to give 
an informal lecture to Carnegie Tech students in the Little Theatre 
of the Fine Arts college at 11:3C^- 
a.m. Tuesday.
Mr. Agronsky will be initiated 
into the local chapter of Omicron 
Delta Kappa, national mens ac
tivities honorary, along with 
twelve campus leaders. The cere
mony will be followed by a ban
quet at the University club where 
Mr. Agronsky will be the main 
speaker.
To be initiated along with Mr.
Agronsky are Hubert I. Aaronson,
Philip S. Birnbaum, William A.
Bourke, John A. Ewart, Ivan
Faigen, Marvin R. Gustavson, 
Larry W. Johnson, John T. Kelly, 
George W. Marshall, Arthur F. 
Naylor, David W. Pettigrew, and 
Dale A. Wright, all to be honored 
for their outstanding work in 
campus activities.
Mr. Agrnskys appearance on 
the Carnegie campus has been ar
ranged by Mr. Stanley March, di
rector of Public Relations. George 
Marshall, president of student 
council, will be master of cere
monies for Mr. Agronskys lecture in the Little Theatre.*"
A man is not generally regarded as being prepared to do re
search in the physical sciences until he has his doctorate.
Pursuing a summation of the advantages of obtaining a doc
torate before entering industry, Dr. Warner, dean of the Graduate 
School, said further, For a smaller part of engineering students, a 
doctorate is a real advantage. The optimum for large groups is a 
Master of Science degree. Initial salaries reflect the confidence placed 
in graduate work, being comparable to those commanded by others 
after ten years of service.
In line with the definite need for more qualified scientists and 
engineers realized from World Wars and demands of our intensified
? technologies, CIT is expanding its 
graduate program. Dr. Warner 
appraised graduate students of 
the aims of the new program at a 
meeting November 13.
In the training of a man for a 
higher degree, the objectives are 
sixfold. He must be competent to 
do significant research and he 
must have mastered the basic sci
ences of his field of study. He 
should show critical judgement in 
evaluating his own work and that 
of other investigators. He must 
possess a high degree of power to 
analyze problems of ever increas
ing complexity. In addition, he 
must have a reading knowledge 
I* of pertinent foreign languages, 
be able to express himself in oral 
and written English, and exhibit 
an interest in the historical de
velopment of science.
At the present time there are 
231 students enrolled in the grad
uate school. Of these, 210 are full 
time students and 21 are doing 
part-time work. Master of Sci
ence degrees are the goals of 100 
students while the remaining 131 
are working for their Doctor of 
Science degree. These degrees are 
offered by the chemistry, physics, 
mathematics, electrical, mechan[Continued on page 8]Martin Agronsky

Editorial
Keys On Trial
When a school official recently totaled up 
the annual sums expended on activities keys 
and questioned the advisability of allocating 
so much money for this purpose, he provided 
additional material for one of the more popu
lar behind-the-scenes discussion topics on cam
pus.
For the methods of awarding activities keys, 
and even the key system itself, have been un
dergoing much quiet critical evaluation lately. 
A number of modifications are being suggested, 
ranging from throw it out entirely  to leave 
the key system alone, its OK as it is.
While the entire question is still in this 
active discussion stage, and before it has been 
re-introduced in Student Council, we wrould like 
to review some old arguments and contribute a 
few further ideas.
The System Is Essentially Sound
The key award concept appears to us to 
be essentially sound. Those shiny bits of metal 
provide one of the many nudges which 
send people out for their first activity, with 
the prospect of an award often being sufficient 
to hold their interest until the real values of 
the activity become apparent.
When the years work is complete, the key 
is the only tangible compensation for hours 
spent at a task which may have produced little 
comment beyond an occasional ascerb remark 
when something went awry.
Of course most activities ultimately supply 
a more:than ample reward in new skills, friend
ships, and in a development of personal re
sponsibility and initiative. But the end of the 
school year is not particularly conducive to 
careful cogitation on the subject of real val
ues, and something bright which can be cred
itably displayed is much appreciated.
Unfortunately, the method of awarding the 
various keys has become somewhat defective 
over a period of time.
The constitutions of many of the activities 
either fail to mention key awards, or cover the 
siibjeet inadequately. Many of the activities 
leaders are similarly hazy on :the subject.
. Some correspondence by the points and keys 
chairman of Student Council should be able 
to reetify this situation without much dif
ficulty, .
A Problem In Morality
But the primary problem has been not in 
the method but in the morality.
The mere occupation of a top position at 
th end of the year is not necessarily justifi
cation for the award of a gold-jeweled key. 
The activity head who makes the actual award 
recommendation to Council might better pause 
before adding an individual name to the honors 
list and consider the particular case.
Exactly what was the nature and extent 
of the job wliich this person held? Just how 
god a job did he actually do?
If the accomplishment does not measure up 
to the requirement, then the award specified 
in the constitution is not the correct one for 
this person;/..: -
Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
When the rolling rails brought Henry Wallace 
to Pittsburgh recently, there was no brass band at 
the station to greet him. There were no cheering 
crowds nor any municipal officials 
to present the keys of the city to 
him. For Wallace has stepped out 
of his once popular role as Young 
Lochinvar, the leader of the com
mon man, and has taken upon his 
shoulders the mantle of a prophet.
Which is bad. A prophet has a 
tremendous reputation to live 
down. When a sequence of speak
ers (arranged in order of increasCarl Klahr ing magnitudes) tell you that each 
has the unbearable honor of introducing blah who 
will introduce the great Henry Wallace, of whom 
they all speak in hushed tones of sanctity, the over
all effect is rather strange, taking place as it does 
in the entourage of the common man. The sten
torian whispers of a movie-actor, who confides that 
he has given up all mundane pursuits to ride the 
rails with Henry Wallace, who tells you that the 
likes of Hank have never been seen for modesty, 
sagacity and courage, who avers that where Wal
lace treads, there faith in human nature is restor
edall this naturally brings up the question': Is 
he man or is he Superman? And if the latter, what 
is he doing outside the comics?
I for one believe that Henry Wallace has a 
point of view to offer this country; be it right 
or be it wrong, Wallace certainly has an attitude 
and a partly-framed set of policies to go with it. 
It would be a very healthy thing if people would 
wonder: Is Russia actually hell-bent upon war, or 
does it look that way partly through the eyes of 
our newspapers?
It would certainly lead in the direction of pro
gress if Wallaces ideas on domestic policy, especial
ly his extension of democracy to guarantee the 
right to a job, to an education, to racial and re
ligious equality, were taken a little more serious
ly. But when the protagonist of such ideas ap
pears as a prophet and white hope leading a cir
cusful of salaaming disciples, it is scarcely possi
ble for these ideals to gain wide acceptance outside 
the circle of his personal followers.
No movement based on the personality of one 
man can long be a success. Its followers must be 
loyal to ideals and to principles, not to an evanes
cent human personality. Go into any miners 
home in the Pittsburgh districtthe chances are 
high that a picture of the late F. D. Roosevelt oc
cupies the most conspicuous spot on the wall. Yet 
the New Deal is as dead as the proverbial doornail, 
simply because Roosevelts twenty-five million fol
lowers were attached to a man, instead of to a 
set of principles which might have unified them.
Take off your prophets mantle, Henry Wallace, 
and talk, to us, if you will, as one man to another. 
Let your logic do the talking and not the hushed 
deification of your devoted followers. Then you 
will stand a chance of convincing us.
Right Face!
By Robert Charpie
Have pity on the poor farmers!! Do you re
member how often we heard that cry during the 
early days of the New Deal. The case of agricul
ture best demonstrates how well-meant legisla
tion can become a formidable weapon in the hands 
of an influential pressure group.
The experts on foreign affairs agree that in 
order to weather the coming winter Europe must 
have help, principally in the form of food. The 
greatest need is for wheat. How then can we jus
tify the fact that some 600 million bushels of 
Americas record wheat crop are being held back 
by the farmers?
The withholding of this grain serves a double 
purpose. It guarantees an ample crop next year, and 
it also maintains an all-time high in the price of 
wheat this year.
Thus a monopolistic market emerges from one 
which has always been the prototype of pure com
petition. However, let us not make the mistake 
of blaming these tactics on the farmer himself. 
No, indeed. For he learned such tricks from agen
cies organized and subsidized by the federal gov
ernment.
The AAA first established marketing quotas in 
the thirties, effectively making an immense cartel 
out of the nations farmers. This was fine when 
farm incomes were well below the national average, 
but times have changed. And although the AAA

Letter To The Editor
Alma Mater Lyrics Defended
Editor, the Tartan:
The Tartan of November 4 con
tained a letter by Mr. James W. 
James of the music department in 
which he expressed his views on 
the new music to the Alma Mater, 
As an individual student of the 
college, Mr. James is entitled to 
think what he pleases about this 
new musical setting, but it is un
fortunate that he chose to publish 
his views without first consulting 
Prof. Charles Pearson, head of the 
music department. The introduc
tion of the new Alma Mater mu
sic was to have been a sort of 
surprise to the student body on 
the forthcoming Carnegie Day ex
ercises. This plan has, of course, 
now been completely ruined.
Since Mr. James has been a 
full-time day student at Carnegie 
Tech for less than two months, it 
is not surprising that his letter 
contains a discussion of technical 
points for which he has no train
ing, as well as statements which 
are based on faulty information. 
In an attempt to clarify these 
points for the non-musicians of 
your reading public, I submit the 
following discussion.
Some time ago the Music De
partment was asked to produce a 
new musical setting to the Alma 
Mater. This request was made by 
the administration and the Alumni 
Association and did not, as some 
might suppose, originate in the 
music department. In compliance 
with this request a new musical 
setting has been produced by Pro
fessor Roland Leich, but it is by 
no means THE Alma Mater. This 
new setting is not official, but it
is one attempt to find a more suit
able melody for the text.
In his letter, Mr. James states, 
Regardless of what the present 
tune may sound like, I am sure 
that Mr. Leichs Here where 
spangled wilderNESS-es is no 
improvement. The point in
volved is a highly technical one, 
but if Mr. James had paid the 
slightest attention to Mr. Leichs 
introductory remarks at the time 
of the rehearsal, he would have 
learned that the word wilder
nesses should not be distorted in 
singing any more than in speak
ing the word.
In another paragraph we find 
the statement: The only twicerepeated rhythm pattern is one 
that only the upperclassmen in the 
music department (having at least 
a year of solfeggio and eurythmics) could be expected to sing 
correctly at sight. This is the 
most abysmal sort of stupidity! 
The deadly rhythmic pattern is 
one that appears in the Scotch 
folk tune, Cornin Through the 
Rye, and occurs on the words 
If a body ... This pattern 
has been called the Scotch snap 
and can be found in Scotch folk 
songs dating back to the sixteenth 
century. While the snap is 
Scotch in origin, it is found occa
sionally in Hungarian folk songs, 
American Negro spirituals and 
modern jazz. This rhythmic pat
tern is so unusual that it can be 
heard no less than twenty times 
a day in the eerie shriek of the 
Juke Box. As for its being only

Smiling Deanie Miller 
Has Energy, Sincerity
Hello there.
Warmly, without restraint and without reservation, Louise Deane 
Millers smile says just that.
Deanieas she is known about campusbacks up that per
petual smile with a personality both sparkling and sincere. Her
sparkle persists without tiring ef-4-----------------------------------------------------
fervescence while her sincerity is
best evidenced by constancy of 
temperament, and frank, always 
friendly, eyes.
Deanie wears the black suit of 
the senior womens honorory  
Mortar Board. What she does for 
the suit is everything in the ex
citing combination of a Titian 
red-head with a classic ivory com
plexion. Scotch and Soda has cap
italized on these and other physi
cal attributes by costuming her in 
Zeigfieldian green filminess for its 
dream scenes.
Distribution of Deanies ener
gies has been most complete. Sup
plementary to honor roll stand
ings in the secretarial department 
of MMCC are her work on WCIT 
scripts and campus publications. 
As editor of the 1947 Thistle and 
as the new associate editor of the 
Scottie, she has shown enthusi
asm for those elements of campus 
life. Willingness to help in any 
and all capacities has marked 
Deanie as a target for assistance 
requests. Receiving them from all 
quarters, she acquiesces with a 
conscientious effort that charac
terizes her attitude toward work.
Kappa Kappa Gamma recogniz
ed those same capabilities by pre
senting Deanie with the responsi
bilities of social chairman. She 
organizes outings, coming thorugh 
with the theme, the atmosphere, 
and the punch that transforms a 
gathering of people into a party
Qualified, then, both personally 
and intellectually, Deanie rates 
without question her status as 
one of our queens of the cam
pus.
Prof. J. Ellis 
Honored By 
Medal Fund
Professor Joseph Bailey Ellis, 
chairman of the executive board 
of the Arts and Crafts Center, was 
recently honored at a reception 
by associates and former students 
of CIT, who announced that a 
medal is to be awarded in his 
honor. This Ellis medal will be 
given annually to the person who 
has most furthered the arts in 
Pittsburgh.
Professor Ellis, who has been 
head of the sculpture department 
here for 25 years, studied sculp
ture at the Massachusetts School 
of Art, the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts, and Ecole Nationale 
des Beaux Arts, in Paris.
Before coming to Carnegie Tech, 
he directed the Modern School of 
Sculpture in Boston, and Saw
yers Island Summer Art school. 
He has been president of the As
sociated Artists and the Pitts
burgh Society of Sculptors.
The Ellis medal will be given 
for the first time early next year.

Student Council Plans 
New Election Method
System Of Balloting Will Remain Unchanged, 
Method Of Ballot Counting Will Be Revised
Introducing an amendment changing the method of electing coun
cil representatives, Student Council held its sixth meeting of the 
year on Thursday evening, November 20. President George Mar
shall dissolved the School-Spirit Committee at the request of David 
Mintz, chairman of the committee.
Norman Larsen, regional chairman of the National Student 
Association, reported to council that he had received a letter from 
the president of the NSA denying any connection with the Young 
Progressive Citizens of America. However, he recommended that 
Student Council refrain from paying dues to the NSA pending a 
more complete investigation of the organization by Dean Dickinson.
The first step in amending F|mA Thi"motlon hjd

when Negley Reed pointed out 
that the money should-revert to 
the original sources. Mr. Naylor 
reported that upon investigation 
he had found that practically all 
the remaining Interhonorary 
funds had been derived from 
dance profits.
The Beaux Arts society pre
sented the budget for the Beaux 
Arts ball, requesting that 75% of 
the profits revert to their organ
ization. Following some opposi
tion by Charles Duffet and Jack

Jerome Bell, was approved unani

Wingless Victory Is Chosen 
For Second Drama Production
The Wingless. Victory, by 
Maxwell Anderson will be the 
drama departments second pro
duction of the year. It will open 
on Monday, December 8, in the 
Little Theatre and will continue 
through December 16, Including in 
its schedule a Friday matinee per
formance.
The Wingless Victory is a 
tragic drama that takes place in 
Salem, Mass., in the year 1800 
when the rigid doctrines of Pur
itanism governed New England. 
Anderson mixes satire with tragic 
human emotion as he points an 
incriminating finger at religious 
and racial prejudice, which was 
as much a problem 150 years ago 
as it is today.
When Captain Nathaniel McQueston returns to Salem from 
the Far East, bringing with him a 
vessel loaded with valuable spices 
and a dark-skinned Malayan wife 
and child, he is treated-es a social 
outcast by his family and neigh
bors. His brother, Rev. Phinea? 
McQueston, openly defies Na
thaniel and refuses to recognize 
Oparre, the Malayan princess, as 
a sister-in-law. Nathaniels moth
er is happy to welcome her son 
home but, like Phineas, she can 
not bear the presence of his wife 
and child.
Ruel McQueston, the youngest 
brother, sympathizes with Nathan
iel and warmly welcomes Oparre 
to the McQueston home. Oparre 
realizes her position, but before
she can make plans to leave Sal 
em, Nathaniel invests a great deal 
of money in a business partnership 
with his brothers. When Nathaniel 
attempts to force his way into so
ciety by his mercenary power, his 
plan backfires, and he is forced 
to make a decision that leads to 
tragic consequences.
The cast for The Wingless Vic
tory includes Nancy Wickwire 
and Judy Lambert sharing the 
role of the princess Oparre; James 
Harkey and George Wood as Cap 
tain Nathaniel; Roger Braun and 
Lester Rosenberg as the heartless 
Rev. Phineas; Elek Hartman and 
Richard Riebling as the good hum 
ored Ruel.
Supporting roles will be played 
by Norman Keats, Edwin Gifford 
Iris Rose, Dorothy Kaye, Helen 
Finlay, Lucille Perlot, Betty Bel 
son, Julie Maury, Jocelyn Reston 
Arlene DuMond, Felice Orlandi 
Bill Oliver, Edward Green, George 
Fieldman, Steven Radoff, and 
Donald Hall.
The production is under the di 
rection of Miss Morris of the dra 
ma department, with Albert Zied 
man as assistant director. Janet 
Cohen is serving as stage manager, 
and stage designer for the show is 
Mr. Heschangh, assistant design 
instructor on the faculty.
"The Wingless Victory was 
first produced in the National The
atre at Washington, D. C. on No
vember 24, 1936 with Katherine

they approved a motion made bj 
chairman Jack Seward of the elec
tions committee. As explained by 
Mr. Seward, the amendment wiU 
provide for a fairer and less com
plicated method of electing repre
sentatives to the Student Council 
Mr. Seward explained that the 
present method of balloting wil] 
remain unchanged, but the meth
od of ballot counting will be re
vised. For instance, if there are 
twelve candidates in the College 
of Engineering, every name on 
every valid ballot submitted will 
be evaluated according to its po
sition. The candidate that the vot
er has indicated as his first choice 
will receive twelve points, second 
choice eleven points, and on down 
the list. All the points thus gained 
by all the candidates will be tab
ulated and the candidates receiv
ing the most points will be elect
ed.
Mr. Seward also reported to 
council that the mathematics de
partment has suggested a method 
of tabulating election results that 
will considerably shorten the time 
and energy formerly consumed by 
this operation. The amendment 
will be complete if it is approved 
at the next meeting of Student 
Council.
Mr. Mintz made his final report 
as chairman of the School Spirit 
committee and secured approval 
for the disbanding of the commit
tee. He reported on the accom
plishments of the committee but 
made no mention of the investiga
tion of the cheerleading squad 
that Jack Johnson had requested 
during the Student Council meet
ing of November 6.

Ticket Cost 
Is Reduced 
For Arts Ball
A reduced price for tickets to 
the Beaux Arts Ball was included 
in the budget at the Student Coun
cil meeting last Thursday.
Treasurer Bennard Perlman 
submitted the proposed reduction 
to the Beaux Arts society last 
week, and it was voted to reduce 
the admission from $3.60 to $3 00, 
tax included. A maximum of 500 
tickets will be sold, with all ticketholders coming stag.
Lee Watkins, president of the 
society, revealed that the affair 
would continue to be for Fine Arts 
students only. A check list of all 
Fine Arts students will be kept by 
the head ticketsellers in all de
partments. Arrangements wiH be 
made for married students to 
bring their wives, however.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1847
TX Will Play Winner 
Of Pitt Touch Football
Striving to avenge last years defeat in the intramural playoffs, 
Theta Xi defeated both Tau Delta Phi and Citcom this week to win 
the championship and qualify to play the winner of the Pitt touch 
football league.
The most exciting game of the week was played last Thursday 
afternoon when the TXs triumphed over Citcom to clinch the school 
title. Trailing in the waning minutes of the game, the winners
broke out their running attack ?------------------------------------------------------
and garnered two first downs and 
a touchdown to win the game by 
a score of 26-24.

To Win First Contest In Last Three Tries
After losing their last two games and four out of the last five, 
the Skibo booters finally broke into the victory column with a 1-0 
victory over Grove City.
Five seniors in the starting lineupDorff, Hartman, Williams, 
Dickson, and Bickerstaffplayed their final game for the Plaid. Co
captains McGehee and Howie Gartner were unable to participate in 
the contest due to injuries sustained in previous games.
Once again the game was play-- 
ed in an ankle-deep quagmire, 
but this time the Skibos proved
The start of the game gave it 
all the appearances of a rout as 
the TXs scored a first down on 
the second play of the game on 
a pass from Green to Ambrose 
which carried to the Citcom 5 
yard line. On the next play, 
Green passed again, this time to 
Kaelin for a touchdown.
But Citcom quickly retaliated 
on two passes from Glunt, one to 
Mackey and another to Biss for 
a touchdown and a first down to 
tie the score at 6-6. The TXs then 
took the lead again on two runs 
by Green for another first down 
and a touchdown. Green scored 
again on a run in the second quar
ter but when the TXs kicked off 
to Citcom, Mackey took the ball 
and ran for a touchdown to make 
the score 18-11 at the half.
In the third quarter, Mackey 
scored twice for Citcom while 
they held the TXs to a single first 
down and took the lead 23-19. 
Then came the decisive fourth 
quarter when the TXs scored 
two first downs and a touchdown 
to win the game.
In the first game of the playoffs, 
the TXs ran up 13 points in the 
first half and then stood off a Tau 
Delt rally in the second half to 
win the game by a score of 14-6. 
The first TX touchdown came on 
a long run by Green after a pass 
from Green to Kaelin had netted 
a first down.
Shortly after the Tau Delts re
ceived the kickoff following this 
touchdown, Ickes intercepted a 
pass and the TXs marched down 
the field, picking up two first 
downs before the Tau Delts de
fense stiffened. The Tau Delts 
took the ball on downs and quick 
kicked to get out of danger. On 
the next play Green again took 
the ball and raced for a touch
down to end the half with the 
TXs leading 13-0.
The Tau Delts dominated the 
play in the second half as they 
threatened continually, but they 
were unable to push the ball over 
for a touchdown. On one series 
of plays they were stopped on 
the TX one inch line, where they

WAA Plans 
Winter Sport 
Activities
A womens swimming club and 
a basketball team are being or
ganized again this year. Participa
tion in either of these activities 
will give points toward Womens 
Athletic Association awards.
Joan Lowe, president of the 
WAA, announced that the first 
meeting of the swimming team 
will be held in the gym, Tuesday, 
December 2, at 12:30 p. m. Prac
tices will be held in the evenings 
although no definite time has been 
set. Later in the year, WAA hopes 
to present an aquacade. It s also 
hoped that some girls will partici
pate in the Intercollegeiate tele
graphic meet which is held every 
year.
The womens basketball season 
open* December 1. Practices will 
be held Mondays, Tuesdays and 
Thursdays at 4:30 p. m. and Wed
nesdays at 3:30 p. m.
The Intramural tournament 
will be held from January 5 to 
February 7. To be eligible for the 
intramurals, a girl must attend 
60% of the practices.
Five Prepares 
For First Tilt
Team Has Appearance 
Of Well Drilled Outfit
Rolling into their final two 
weeks of pre-season practice, the 
basketball squad is beginning to 
take on the appearance of a welldrilled outfit.
Bill Donohoe, head coach, took 
over the reins from Mel Cratsley 
on Monday and immediately be
gan to prepare for the opening 
game with Grove City on Decem
ber 10. Actually, since Thanks
giving vacation will intervene, the 
team will have only about ten 
more days of practice before it 
takes the floor against Grove City.
Although they expected to be 
pitted against an amateur team 
last Tuesday, the Tartans found 
themselves taking the floor against 
the Altoona Edwards. Altoona, 
one of the strongest professional 
aggregations in Pennsylvania, 
broke away to a fast lead over the 
Tartans.
It was not until the fourth quar
ter that the Tartans found them
selves. When they did, however, 
they matched Altoona all the way 
to the final whistle.
The squad has now been nar
rowed down to 16 players. The 
first two teams include Mike The
odore, Tasso Katselas, Joe Matsey, 
Marty Chetlin, Jack Riehl, How
ard Johe, Connie Hemmann, Bob 
McCullough, CliffDunn, and Dave 
Ellies. The balance of the squad 
includes Vince Fastuca, Walt 
Mruk, Kooes, Don Johnson, Hube 
Fitzgerald, and Len Bianchi.

Andrew Sterrett questioned the 
$300 budgeted for publicity and 
Naylor explained that that amount 
was probably not out of line with 
the overall budget of $10,000. The 
budget was based on the sale of 
1500 tickets a night for four per
formances.
On the motion of Mr. Ulrich, 
the stated time of meeting of Stu
dent Council was changed to Wed
nesday, at 4:30 pjn. The Council 
will reconvene Wednesday after
noon, December 3.
During the course of the short 
meeting, council granted permis
sion to Alpha Epsilon Phi to hold 
a closed off-campus dance on De
cember 13, and permission to Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon fraternity to 
hold a similar affair on April 3,
Mr. Larsen gained the approval 
of council to hold the Western 
Pennsylvania sub-regional con
ference of the National Student 
association in the council room of 
the Carnegie Union on Saturday, 
November 22.
The Womens Guild was given 
permission to hold a Tag Day on 
December 8 for the benefit of their 
scholarship fund. Council also ap
propriated $10 for the decoration 
of the Carnegie Union.
President Marshall closed the 
meetim? after reminding the coun
cil of the importance of their at
tendance at the Carnegie Day ex
ercises. He also secured the back
ing of Student Council for the all

themselves superior mudders. The 
Grovers did not waste any time 
driving downfield after the open
ing whistle, and for a while it ap
peared to be a rout. However the 
Skibo defense, featured by Marty 
Dorffs brilliant goal tending, held 
firm. Soon the Skibos found them
selves originating offensive rushes 
oi their own. The second quarter 
was played on even terms, with 
both teams failing to take advan
tage of their scoring opportunities.
Jaek Burrey, moved to the Tar
tan fullback position in the third 
quarter, showed some brilliant 
booting. His untiring work broke 
up one Grover rush after another. 
By that time the ball had become 
very wet and heavy and the foot
ing unsure.
Five minutes after the begin
ning of the final quarter, George 
De Moraes kick was blocked by 
the arms of one of the Grovers 
within the 18 yard zone. This con
stituted an automatic penalty kick.
Coach OConner sent Otto Ab
raham into the game to do the 
booting. He sent the ball into the 
upper left hand corner of the 
goal, easily beating the Grove 
City goalie.
The Grovers used every avail
able man to bolster their offensive 
during the last few minutes, but 
the Tartans were equal to the oc
casion. Marty Dorff, Jim Fleming, 
and Jack Burrey stood out for the 
Tartans during the final stand.

has long since passed out of ex
istence, the present wheat situa
tion testifies to the fact that, in ef
fect, the quota system goes on.
For some twenty years the far
mer has enjoyed the advantage 
of parity prices, based on a period 
of prosperity. Through the Land 
Banks and the OCC he has had 
the advantage of the cheapest and 
most extensive credit available 
anywhere. He can even borrow 
money on unharvested crops, and 
by dealing in futures he has been 
able to insure himself against 
precipitous falls in the market.
In order to maintain prices the 
administration sanctioned the 
killing of little pigs and the plow

come-back can we have now 
when we hear of the burning of 
mountains of potatoes or the stor
ing of millions of bushels of 
wheat?
No, we cannot place the entire

Last Saturday brought to Forbes 
field the best game of the Tartans 
short season. All afternoon a 
courageous Skibo eleven fought a 
bigger Wolverine outfit in a heat
ed battle that finally ended with 
Grove City on the long end of a 
7-0 score.
After a punting duel through
out the first half, the two teams 
continued the battle in the third 
quarter. Foster and Reid of the 
Grovers traded punts with Helland and after seven kicks, the 
Wolverines were able to build up 
a drive that resulted in a touch
down.
A Helland kick was returned to 
the Tartan 23. After Caccamise 
and Shankle advanced the ball to 
the 18, Foster faded and passed to 
Hamilton who was in the act of 
crossing the goal as he caught the 
ball. Reid converted with a place
ment that split the uprights.
The teams were almost equally 
matched in all departments, but 
played a vastly different type of 
game. During the first half the 
Grovers seemed content to let the 
Tartans have the ball and wear 
themselves out on the offense. 
Each time Grove City received, 
Foster would send the ball back 
towards the Tartan safety man. 
Both teams seemed to enjoy this 
procedure as 18 punts soared into 
the ozone during the afternoon.
The Tartans tried a running 
game and were able to pick up 14 
first downs, but they were unable 
to cross the opponents goal line. 
Highberger and Janosky were 
moving at full speed each time 
they cracked into the Wolverine 
forward wall and picked up some 
sizeable gains. The two light
weights, Jerry Helland and Jim 
Trabits, made several distance 
runs as they danced through the 
holes opened by the line.
Coach Donohoe started all of 
his seniors, but as the game pro
gressed he inserted underclass
men who played most of the 
game. The only exception was 
durable Fran Janosky who gave 
the best running and blocking dis
play of his career at Carnegie 
Tech while playing almost 60 
minutes.
Grove City placed a big starting 
team on the field and each time a 
replacement entered the game he 
outweighed his predecessor. The 
largest of these was sub tackle

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Creguts Sports Scope
Improvement Over Last Year 
Noted Despite Team Records
Pete Cregrut
With the end of the fall sports 
program now at hand, it might 
be well to go back over the sea
son and look for any indications 
of what we might expect next 
year.
Victories have not keynoted the 
Tartan athletic picture during the 
past two months, 
gff with the foot
ball team hav
ing suffered another winless 
season, the soc
cer team win
ning only two 
out of six and 
the cross coun- try team able;~'ll onlv to break
* even. But can
any one deny 
that there has 
been improvement?
Although they were not able to 
score at all last year, the football 
team improved to such an extent 
that they were held scoreless only 
once this season. And in two of 
the six games they played, a few 
breaks might easily have seen the 
Plaid emerge victorious. Can
that be said of last season?
The line has developed into one 
of the best in the district. It is far 
from being the heaviest, but it can 
qualify among the toughest. And 
the most important factor is that 
it is young and should improve 
Only Dick DeMuesy, a tackle, and 
Tex Shapiro, a guard, are slated 
for graduation this year. This will 
leave Williamson, Dougherty, Stovicek and Armour available for 
duty at the ends again next year. 
Whereas the ends were the weak 
spots during the first few games, 
they improved tremendously with 
experience and it became increas 
ingly rare as the season progress
ed to see the opposition sweep the 
ends and get away with it.
At the tackles, Keats and Meyers 
will be back and should improve 
even more than they did this sea
son. The guards will show Maxton, Wiseman, Madden and Mc
Intyre, all of whom saw consid
erable action this season. At cen
ter, of * course, will be C. B. 
GroomeS who seems to be in on 
just about every tackle. Windish 
will be around to give Groomes
support and with a little more 
polish on offensive duties he 
should be extremely capable.
The backfield will suffer the 
greatest losses and will be most 
in need of additional talent next 
year, Maley, Janosky, and Pappafava will be lost through grad
uation, leaving vacancies in both 
the blocking and passing posi
tions. Helland will be back, as 
will Highberger, Warner, Som
mers, Yarian, Kenney, Logsdon, 
DeGiovani, Wilson and Magnifico. 
The one thing that is going to be 
most sorely needed is a big man 
that can drive through a line and 
add diversity to the attack in ad
dition to picking up that all-im
portant one yard when it is need
ed. This was the biggest thing 
lacking this year because there 
was no one who could cause the 
opposition to pull its defense in 
toward the center of the line in 
order to facilitate shaking Hel
land, Highberger and DiGiovanni 
loose around the ends. If such a 
man can be found, the Tartans 
will be able to do a lot of dam
age next year.
Considering the overall picture, 
we believe that there are some 
very heartening signs. While, as 
we said previously, this season 
could not be called a success, 
there are all the makings for the 
development of Carnegie into a 
district class B football power, 
The school has attracted some 
fine high school talent this past 
year and with improvement will 
attract more. With a predomin
ately freshman team, they were 
nearly able to win two games 
The possibility exists that by the 
time these freshmen become sen
iors there may be a district 
championship.
Indoor Season 
Is Under Way
Dorm Team Leads 
In Volley Ball League
seasonThe indoor intramural 
is getting under way and soon 
will be rolling in high gear. Sev
eral games have been played in 
both the volley ball and table ten
nis leagues, while the bowling 
matches begin immediately after 
the Thanksgiving vacation.
The Dorm Combine No. 7 team 
jumped off to a roaring start in 
the volley ball league and at the 
time of this writing are far out in 
front of all teams with a record 
of three straight victories. They 
trounced the Unknowns, Phi Kaps, 
and Tau Delt B teams in that or
der.
Table tennis games are being 
played each afternoon but at pres
ent there have not been enough 
games played to determine any 
strong teams or to give any indi 
cation of the probable outcome of 
the leagues.
The weekend of' December 6 is 
the starting date for bowling. The 
league is divided into two sec 
tions of nine teams each. Every 
Saturday afternoon until midMarch, sixteen teams will square 
off against one another at 1:00 p. 
m. at the University alleys on

Blocking Back Spot 
Suits Fran Janosky
The unknown player on all football teams is the blocking back. 
The Tartans Fran Janosky, powerful little senior, finds this position 
almost entirely to his liking. His only complaint is -that he didnt 
get his hands on the ball all season before the Groce City game.
The requirements for a good blocking back are that he must be 
fast and rugged. He must be well grounded in fundamentals and be 
able to get a blocking angle on his opponent or else have the drive
---------------------------------------------------? to bowl him over by physical
force alone. The successful perFran Janosky

Charley Carlson who weighed 250 
pounds. George Humphrey Caccamise was also inserted at full
back to bounce his 240 pounds 
against the Carnegie line but was 
not as effective as he had been 
against other Wolverine oppon
ents.
The lines of both teams played 
outstanding games. Maxton, Mey
ers, Madden and Groomes were 
on hand to dampen any hopes the 
Grover backs had of long gains. 
Before their encounter with the 
Plaid, the Wolverines had scored 
an average of 20 points per game 
for the last five games.
Although the Tartans made less 
mistakes and played a smoother 
game than they had all season, 
they were unable to score for the 
first time this year. They threat
ened several times but each time 
the offensive bogged down as it 
neared paydirt.
The Grovers missed a chance 
to score late in the first quarter 
when Shankle fumbled on the 
Skibo 2 yard line. The ball slid 
out of his arms and landed in the 
end zone where Madden recover
ed for Carnegie.
This game ended the season for 
Doth teams. The defeat for the 
Tartans marked the eighteenth 
consecutive game without a win. 
The victory gave Grove City its 
best season since 1933 and a sea
sons record of six wins arid two 
setbacks.
[Continued from page 2] 
twice-repeated, I took the trouble 
to check the score and -find that 
this figure makes its appearance 
no less than thirteen times from 
the first bar to the last!
Why try to be original for 
Originalitys sake, when it is ap
parent that originality of the tune 
is one of the greatest obstacles in 
the way of enabling us to sing our 
*Alma Mater with the fervor and 
love in our hearts that we all 
want to feel . . . ? It would 
seem fitting (on the surface) that 
the Tech Alma Mater have ah 
original melody . . . Idealistical
ly, this is a good thought, but, un
fortunately, not practical in this 
situation. From an upperclass
man the latter part of this state
ment would probably indicate 
some form of insanity, for as 
every music student knows, the 
Carnegie Tech faculty includes 
some of the most outstanding cre
ative talent in the musical world 
today. It is important for read
ers outside the music school to 
know that Mr. James, though ex
pressing his honest opinion at the 
time simply did not know what 
he was talking about.
Familiar tunes of favorite 
hymns, national anthems of other 
countries, and other national folk 
tunes have been used over and 
over again for high school and 
college alma maters. Tnis state
ment probably should be cast in 
bronze and placed in the front 
corridor! One wonders if Mr. 
James has ever reflected for more 
than seven seconds on the defini
tion of the word familiar. Per
haps he thinks the Pilgrims found 
a leather-bound volume entitled 
Familiar American Folk Tunes for 
the Twentieth Century lying on 
Plymouth Rock one gloomy Sun
day in 1620. If such is the case, 
let me say that the first phase in 
the evolution of the Alma Mater 
was the present text sung to the
formance of all of these tasks calls 
for an abundance of determination 
and a fair amount of skill and ex
perience.
Fran probably has more colle
giate experience than any mem
ber of Coach Donohoes eleven. 
His first fling at college ball found 
him holding down an end position 
on Charley Bowsers 1942 edition 
of the Pitt frosh. At the end of 
the season Fran enlisted in the 
Naval Air Corps and Pitt was a 
thing of the past.
The next season found him at 
Renssalaer Polytech where he was 
again a candidate for an end po
sition. The old injury jinx ap
peared, and Fran broke his left 
leg on the third day of practice. 
He hobbled around, kept in con
tact with the team, and managed 
to break into the line-up for the 
final two games of the season.
A Navy transfer found Fran in 
the deep South. This time he was 
an end on the North Carolina PreFlight squad that carried such 
grid greats as Clevelands Otto 
Graham. He managed to play 
three games with them before an
other transfer came.
After serving two years in the 
Navy and another in the Merchant 
Marine, Fra returned to Pitts
burgh and entered Carnegie Tech 
in 1946. He promptly turned out 
for the varsity and played end on 
last years losing team. This sea
son Coach Donohoe recognized 
Frans blocking abilities and 
moved him to a blocking position. 
Since then he has played almost 
the entire sixty minutes of each 
game.
Every time this plucky halfback 
took the field this fall he carried 
with him an intense desire to win. 
For a man who weighs 180 pounds 
and can stretch to five feet ei^ht 
inches he packs a terrific wallop 
Coach Donohoe has utilized his 
experience by placing nan 
defensive line backer spot ir. -c 
games this past season.
Fran is now a senior ir t * 
electrical engineering department. 
He is twenty-three years old and 
another of the teams married 
men. His extra-curricular activi
ties are the Varsity club, Eta Kap
pa Nu, and AIEE.

Austrian Hymn by Haydn. The 
second phase, the writing of orig
inal music, was passed about 1922 
when Dr. OBrien produced the 
present setting. This phase is 
likely to continue until a suitable 
melody is written and, though Mr. 
James might not like it, I am 
very much afraid there is nothing 
he can do about it.
Generally speaking people hate 
change, even when it is an im
provement over what they have 
been accustomed to. Mr. James 
comments have probably made 
many people dislike the idea of 
a new Alma Mater even though 
they have never heard it. Since 
such is the case, it is too bad he 
chose to offer his opinions as a 
musician and has discussed tech
nical points which lie completely 
outside his present field of knowl
edge. Mr. James is a member of 
what he calls  . . . a select, 
hand-picked student group chosen 
from a host of talented appli
cants. In this he is entirely ac
curate, but by intimating that only 
upperclassmen are prepared to 
cope with the rhythmic complexi
ties of the Scotch snap he hints 
that the admissions committee has 
been successful only in culling a 
bumper crop of musical idiot 
from that talented host.

president of the AIChE student 
branch chapter on Thursday, No
vember 13. Other officers elected 
were Ray Kondrat, vice-presi
dent; Ed Vidt, treasurer; and Lud
wig Benner, secretary.
The purpose of the CIT student 
branch of the American Institute 
of Chemical Engineering is to let 
the chemical engineering students 
know what is happening in their 
field and to increase their inter
est and activity in it.
The chapter is putting on a 
drive for new members and is 
trying to enlarge its social and 
speaking programs. Meetings are 
held twice a month.
Science Club
Dr. Claude R. Schwob, a pro
fessor in the department of chem
istry in the College of Engineer
ing and Science, addressed the 
Science club of Margaret Mor
rison at its first dinner meeting 
on Thursday evening, November 
20, at the Carnegie Union.
The subject of his speech was 
Nuclear Energy, and he ex
plained several details about the 
atom bomb and related chain re
actions. He stated that the horror 
of newer and more powerful atom 
bombs was a persuasive argument 
for the development of means of 
preventing future warfare.
Dr. Schwob has done considera
ble work in connection with the 
development of the atom bomb.
Fine Arts Has 
Housing Show
Beginning on November 15 and 
running for three successive 
weeks, the display from the Mu
seum of Modern Art in New York 
entitled, If You Want To Build 
A House, will be on exhibition in 
the Fine Arts building.
Composed of photographs, pan
els, cartoons, colored slides, and 
written material, the exhibit will 
serve to acquaint the students and 
the public with the best in con
temporary American domestic 
architecture. All aspects of fine 
architecture will be discussed and 
reviewed.
The show forcibly confirms a 
book of the same title by Eliza
beth Mock, which was published 
about a year ago by the Museum 
of Modem Art. It is gaining the 
interest of those contemplating 
building a home as well as any 
student of modem architecture. 
The show has been obtained by 
the department of architecture 
through the efforts of Philae 
Temple of Scarab, the national 
architectural honorary society.
The Fischer Tropsch process for 
the synthesis of hydrocarbons by 
combining carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen is described by John 
Stephenson. Physicists and elec
trical engineers will read Lawr
ence Johnsons article on radio 
acoustics, explaining necessity of 
low distortion and extended fre
quency range in the reproduction 
of music.
Of great importance to metal
lurgists is the diffusion of metallic 
atoms in a mixture of metals. The 
measurement of the diffusion, as 
accomplished by the use of radio
active tracers, such as radio-ac
tive iron, is explained by Dr. Rob
ert F. Mehl and Kenneth E. Gold

Carrying out this theme, the or

of aiding students, it was felt, is 
to breach the gap between the 
men and women evening students.

GREYHOUN
Doherty Speech
[Continued, from, page 1] 
faculty, best educational program, 
and as good facilities as possible 
within our resources.
Bridging the Gap
CIT is for the students, he 
continued, and although I am 
unable to see all of you person
ally, I am attempting to bridge 
the gap insofar as is practicable 
through your representatives on 
the Student Conference Commit
tee.
Conclusion of the summer tri
mester program, difficulties with 
an overlarge enrollment, and pres
ent financial problems hampering 
the Institutes building program 
were also noted in the presidents 
omnibus address.
In 'discussing the new educa
tion plan, Dr. Doherty explained: 
I am eager that you understand 
the significance to you of the edu
cational reconstruction now tak
ing place on your campus.
It is an occasion for pride and 
satisfaction, a stimulus to genuine 
interest, and an incentive to gen
uine effort.
Pointing out that the traditional 
process of revision in which mere
ly subject matters in the curric
ulum are shifted about is the sim
ple and inadequate approach to 
the problem, he explained that 
CIT is using the incomparably 
more difficult and time-consum
ing system of changing, in addi
tion, the actual method of instruc
tion.
Toward a Genuine Solution
The faculty has worked at it 
for ten years, and we are now far 
enough alongespecially after the 
last three years during which we
have had the leadership of Pro
vost Smithto justify my opinion 
that, although we are a long way 
from our goal, we are far along 
toward a genuine solution of the 
problem of professional educa
tion.
A considerable portion of the 
presidents speech was devoted to 
the perennial student question: 
Why cant we have a foootball 
team like Notre Dame or Army?
Reiterating that CIT offers pri
marily professional courses in 
which there is no large amount of 
extra time, no easy .liberal arts 
curriculum, and most important, 
no curriculum in physical educa
tion, he stated that the question 
of whether or not football players 
should be paid does not have to 
be argued, the other reason being 
decisive.
The need of a Class A team to 
practice long hours was also point
ed out, and Dr. Doherty contrast
ed this requirement with Carnegie 
Tech classes that end at 4:30, a 
grueling practice until 6:30, and 
the near impossibility of conclud
ing this day with the long study 
session needed to keep up with 
the curriculum.
Basically Incompatible
We cant have both Class A 
football and professional educa
tion unless we set football up as 
a side-show with special educa
tional programs for the squad, 
and this we cannot do.
But claiming that Carnegie 
Tech does not need to have this 
type of team, Dr. Doherty stated 
that we can. have football and 
other inter-collegiate sports on a 
modest scale, and win our share 
of games when playing Case and 
Lehigh and others of comparable 
strength.
I want CIT to have just as

masters degrees had been obtain
ed at CIT.
Subsequent to the last war, the 
graduate school has again been 
completely reorganized. The ad
mission requirements are, gen
erally, an under-graduate cur
riculum similar to the one at CIT. 
It is required that graduate stu
dents maintain an average of 
B or better. The Graduate 
Record examination is desired but 
not required. To obtain the M. S. 
degree, 96 units of work must be 
completed here. A thesis is op
tional. For the doctorate at least 
one year in full-time residence 
work is necessary, along with a 
thesis.
The graduate faculty expects 
to confer from 25 to 30 Doctor of 
Science degrees and about 75 
Master of Science degrees each 
year. The limitation at present is 
imposed by the amount of re
search space available in the 
various departments.
With the migration of women 
students to Morewood Gardens in 
the fall o* 1948, there will be 
three dorms available for grad
uate students. These will be Whit
field, Mellon, and Birch halls.
To the end of establishing a 
community of interest and under
standing between faculty and stu
dents, a Graduate Student Con
ference has been organized to 
meet with Dr. Warner. It is the 
intended purpose of this group to 
make graduate studies as pleasant 
and profitable as possible, so that 
there will be a better understand
ing of mutual problems.
Addressing the graduate stu
dent assembly at a recent meet
ing, Dr. Doherty expressed the 
hope that The students doing 
graduate work should realize that 
the responsibility is on their 
shoulders to give attention to 
problems that involve the rela
tionship of science and technology 
to society.
