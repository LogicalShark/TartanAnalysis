Artistic Perfection and Unique Beauty 
Of Easter Floral Display Awes Crowds
As the interscholastic track meet 
had been scheduled for Saturday, May 
5, the Campus Week committee found 
some difficulty in arranging a program 
due to the interference of the high 
school athletes who would be on the 
campus that day. The matter of 
changing the date to May 3 and 4 was 
brought up to Student Council and 
discussed. A committee of the Coun
cil and the general chairman of Cam
pus Week, Bill Kunkel, met with the 
Student Activities committee and ex
plained the situation. This body then 
made the recommendation to the execntive board which gave its approval to 
the proposed dates. As finally arrang
ed, Campus Week will be held Thurs
day and Friday, May 3 and 4, with the 
student night for the Campus Week 
show, Wedding Bells on Friday 
night.
The plans for Campus Week are 
well under way, and with the addition 
of many new features, this years 
Campus Week promises to be two 
days and three nights of true gayety. 
The program as tentatively arranged, 
presents a schedule crowded with 
evehts to take place simultaneously 
on various parts of the campus. A 
cabaret dance, to be held in the Union, 
Friday afternoon, will compete with 
the attractions of a costumed roller 
skate carnival. , A delightful farce, 
Wedding Bells, will entertain the 
student body Friday night, the annual 
' alumni and student athletic events 
will take place on both afternoons, the 
interfraternity competitions will vie 
with the girls events for the approval 
of the crowds, and the campus clowns 
and comedians will demonstrate their 
ability in impromptu stunts at all 
hours.
The campus will be given a holiday 
appearance by the decorations and ef
fects arranged by the committee in 
charge of lighting. As the fraternities 
have agreed not .to decorate their 
houses for Campus Week, and there 
will be a minimum of decoration on 
the campus, the decorative effects of 
electrical apparatus will be resorted 
to in order to give the frolic a touch 
of gayety and color.
A tentative program was drawn up 
at the last Campus Week meeting. 
The program as arranged is as fol
lows :

Migratory Dances.

Plebe Prom Sets 
PLEBR Of Day As 
Freshmen Cavort
Exemptions Issued to Those 
Qualifying as Best 
Costumed
Today the campus literally swarms 
with a great variety of freaks and 
clowns. A stranger might think that 
the "Worlds Greatest had slipped 
unexpectedly into town but tis, the an
nual Plebe Prom or all Fools Day as 
it has been known in the past.
At 11:30 judging will begin in 
Science, Arts and Margaret Morrison, 
all Industries plebes will be judged in 
Science. All freshmen will be excused 
d,t 11 oclock so that they will be 
dressed and ready for judging prompt
ly at 11:30 a. m. All frosh will parade 
one at a time before the assembled 
upperclassmen and the volume of ap
plause received will be an indication 
to the judges as to which plebes de
serve exemption. From 5-8 students 
will be exempt in each school depend
ing upon the comparative enrollment 
of the four colleges.
At 12:30 all frosh will be assembled 
on Woodlawn avenue in front of the 
Central Building and from there they 
will parade down Woodlawn back of 
the Clown Band which will be com
posed of all plebes who play musical 
instruments. The parade will proba
bly break up at 1 oclock.
This annual affair is not just another 
phase of regulations which should be 
avoided if possible but is a Carnegie 
custom and it is the duty of every 
plebe to support this school function, 
show your school spirit, plebes, and 
make this day a success. The penalty 
for not being there, a hair cut, is for 
those unfortunate individuals who do 
not have sufficient school spirit to 
make them attend this annual prom
enade. A careful check of the class 
rolls will be taken before judging be
gins, by the members of the regula
tions committee.
The assemblies in the various 
schools will be under the direct super
vision of the Senate presidents of 
their respective schools. These judges 
will be assisted by members of the 
regulations committee of the various 
schools, and also by the members of 
the Druids, sophomore class honorary. 
Fred Woods is the general chairman 
of the Plebe Prom committee, com
posed of the following student: Jean
Mather, president of the Margaret 
Morrison Senate; Mary L. Seibert, 
president of the Arts Senate; Fenton 
Finn, president of the Science Senate, 
and A1 Brown, president of the Indus
tries Senate.
The annual Easter Flower Show at 
Phipps Conservatory in Schenley 
Park has attracted considerable at-, 
tention this year. Every afternoon 
leisurely crowds stroll' in and out to 
view the lovely show. Women in 
Easter clothes threaten to outdo the 
flowers in the splendor of their cos
tumes. But that is impossible. Vivid* 
blossoms everywhere, fragrant pre
monitions of Spring. The arrange
ment of the flowers into separate dis
plays is a marvel of artistic perfec-. 
tion.
The Hillside Garden featuring 
hardy shrubs and roses is a very dis
tinctive feature of this exhibit. A 
specially interesting feature of this 
exhibit is the House of Schizanthus 
or the House of the Butterfly Flower, 
which flower has often been called the 
Poor Mans Flower.
The Vista is a green grassy 
mound topped with a pavilion under 
which is a marble statue. A stone 
flagged walk leads up the mound to 
the pavilion. The mound is almost 
completely covered with soft green 
grass with a border of mixed flowers
around the edge. The Dutch Gar
den" is very beautiful with its vari
colored tulips and hyacinths. The 
centerpiece of the exhibit is a small 
thatched but surrounded by a gravel 
walk. A small rustic brfftge leads out 
to a windmill set on a small piece of 
land entirely surrounded by water. 
There are dark red tulips in back of 
the thatched cottage and bright red 
and red and yellow streaked tulips in 
front of the house and around the 
windmill.
In another room were all varities 
of roses, such as tea roses, monthly 
roses, climbing roses, etc. This ex
hibit was, perhaps, the most strikiug 
one of the whole show. The natural 
blending of the many colored roses 
was quite effective and impressed, 
the observer with the extreme care 
used in arranging them.
In another part of the exhibit one 
j finds a float of Hydrangeas an al
most solid mass of white blossoms. 
Another float was covered with a very 
rich display of Easter lilies, magnifi
cent in their purity. The exhibit 
closed in a room containing a mound 
of genista and azalea.

galosh, tagged with a crimson bow, 
slept peacefully through the abandon
ment, yttle realizing their cruel 
plight until they were taken into the 
house by the University of Washing
ton fraternity men, who answered the 
door after the bell' had been rung.
A single scrawled note, attached to 
one of the infants, read: "Treat them 
kindly. A thorough search of the 
neighborhood, immediately instigated, 
failed to produce any persons, connect
ed with the little darkies.
We are thoroughly astounded, one 
of the fraternity brothers said in an 
exclusive interview, as it is rather a 
stupendous task for 40. fraternity men 
to undertake the rearing of two aban
doned black infants. But we will doour best.
And so, Phi Gamma Delta has in its 
possession twin Persian kittens, which 
it is willing to offer, for Tolo dates,

Lawrence, Kans. (IP and Univer
sity Daily Kansan)Students at Com
monwealth College, the overall 
school where faculty members and 
classmen of all degrees engage in 
manual labor each day, have started 
a publication called The Campus 
Bluff, the worlds largest news
paper.
It consists of two pages, each five 
feet long and three and one-half feet, 
wide, and Its total circulation consists 
of one copy per issue.
The paper is hand made. A bulle
tin board was created out of ship-lap 
lumber. The columns are live Inches 
wide. Each story is written on type
writer paper of the required width 
and then pasted on the board. Heads 
are hand-printed. Regular newspaper 
makeup styles are followed by the 
use of hand printed rules and dashes; 
cartoons and illustrations are simply 
original drawings pasted on the board. 
When miule up, the paper has the ap
pearance of an enlarged page of any 
conventional newspaper.

The big Varsity Clan theater party 
is now several weeks closer, and 
everything is in readiness for a ban
ner event. Included in the many 
guests are the following athletic 
teams: Football, basketball, tennis,
rifle, cross country, swimming, and 
track, The managers and coaches of 
these teams, as well as the managers 
and coaches of the freshman football 
team, will also be among the guests.
Tlie theater party, which is to be 
held (jii Monday evening, April 10, is 
the annual party given ,by the Varsity 
Clan for the athletic teams, but this 
is the first time it has taken the form 
of a theater party, and the first time 
it has included so many guests. The 
show which has been selected is 
Clutching Claws, which promises to 
be a thrilling mystery play, and to 
which everyone is looking forward 
with keen anticipation.
Tickets have been going in a re
markable manner and it looks as 
though the affair will be exclusively 
Carnegie Tech. About five hundred 
tickets have been sold to members of 
the Varsity Claji, and about one hun
dred of the student tickets are gone. 
The campus sale of tickets to students 
wjfl begin, today at Buddy Overend's 
office and will continue tins week.
In addition to the regular play, the 
Committee, of the Clan planning the 
affair, have some additional features 
on the program. However, the nature 
of these is a a deep secret, since their 
success depends upon the element of 
surprise. Suffice it to say, that the 
assurance of the committee ought to 
be inducement enough.
Alumni still desiring tickets should 
apply for them through Al Irwin, who 
is located in the Graduate Managers 
office in. the Gym. The price is two 
seats for five dollars.. Those, who. 
still desire tickets should obtain them 
at the earliest date possible, since 
there are not many left. Lets make 
this an . exclusively Carnegie Tech af
fair, and fill the'house next Monday 
night with good loyal Carnegians.
Providence, R. I.CIPj-According 
to the Brown Daily Herald, revenue 
derived from sales at the Brown uni
versity Union is greater from smok
ing materials than from any other 
luxury or commodity, tlie undergradu
ates purchase from the organization.
About $250^ we'elc is .spent by.Vstudents for tobacco, while a -slightly 
less amount Is spent for candy.
Cigarettes load tliu list of smudges 
sold, while pipe tobacto and cigars 
follow In order. Not enough chewing 
tobacco Is disposed of among the un
dergraduates to make it worth men
tioning, the Herald says.
The standard brands of chocolate 
are by ifar (he most popular sweet 
sales.
The average amount spent by,each 
student at Brown for both candy and 
tobacco amounts to approximately 35 
tierfts.
And now we hear from a former 
Campus Queen who has deviated 
somewhat from the path followed by 
her predecessors in this column. A 
queen has been marriedand why 
not? One who has been so honored 
shoyld make an Ideal wife in our 
opinion. The third story is about our 
second Campus Queen Marguerite 
Dorothy Harmon who was queen in 
1923.
Peg was very active while in school 
being crowned queen in her junior 
year. She was a member of the 
Drama Department and after leaving 
school was engaged in work in this 
line. For two seasons she played 
leads with a small company at the Art
Colony located at Milton on the Hud
son. While doing leads there Herbery 
Osborne formerly of Tec)i was direc
tor. The next season was spent in 
New York City with the Theater 
Guild.
Last September Peg made what she 
claims was the most important thing 
that she lias ever done. She became 
Mrs. Donald Mong o.n this date. Her 
husband is a graduate of Lehigh and 
a member of several honorary frater
nities., They are now living in Erie 
where Mr. Mong is connected with 
the Mutual Telephone Company.
Mrs. Mong is a member of the Erie 
Clan, which is one of the most active 
of our clans and is in this way still 
connected with her Alma Mater.

Lest we forget what our Employ
ment Bureau is doing, we . once more 
bring to your attention its activities. 
The Bureau keeps actively in touch 
with 3,500 firms who have taken men 
from Carnegie, and it is through these 
that the Seniors each year are largely, 
placed.
About a week ago the Bureau sent 
out over 2,800 letters to spme of these 
firms, telling of the Bureaus scope, 
the number of Seniors graduating 
this year, and asking for suggestions 
as to how the Bureau may better 
serve. The following letter, coming 
as it does from the presidents office 
in a corporation like Carnegie Steel, 
illustrates industrys attitude toward 
the work done by the Bureau.

So say we after reading in the news
paper about Theodore Eicholz, a. 
Pittsburgh architect, and a graduate 
of our architectural department who 
has agreed to do something which 
others have, said is impossible.
The feat which Eicholz proposes 
to do, is to jack up a 4,500 ton office 
building, of eight stories, put in a 
ninth story between the first and sec* 
ond floors, and replace the old granite 
piers nowf in place by modern steel 
supports. Perhaps some of you re
member the building. It is the Granite 
Building, at the corner of sixth ave
nue and Wood street in Pittsburgh.
Eicholzs plans have been approved 
by city engineers, and work is now 
under way to jack the building up, 
and the total time to do the work is 
estimated at ninety days. So we say 
again, let a Carnegie man do it.

STUDENT INSPECTION TRIPS
PROVE VERY EDUCATIONAL
The advantages afforded to techni
cal students attending school in Pitts
burgh are brought out by the inspec
tion trips on which the electrical en- i 
gineering students are going this year. 
The next one scheduled will be on 
Saturday, April 14, to the Brunots 
Island power plant of the Duquesne 
Light Company. A great deal of work 
has been and is still being done to 
modernize the Brunots Island plant, 
so that it is now the largest isolated 
power plant in America. From Bru
nots Island the inspection party will 
visit a substation a short distance 
away. This substation is particularly 
interesting because it uses mercury 
arc rectifiers in place of the usual ro
tating machinery. The Duquesne 
Light Company will provide busses 
for transportation from the school.
DR. HEINROTH CONCLUDES
MUSICAL LECTURE SERIES
For the past six weeks, every Sat

tured on subjects of musical interest, j 
These lectures were part , of the an
nual pre-Lenten series which Dr. Hein
roth delivers instead of his usual Sat
urday evening organ recitals.
The first two of these two lectures, I 
delivered on February 25 and on March I 
3, were devoted to an appreciation of ] 
Schuberts music. The centenary of ! 
that composer's death is this year, and 
the lectures were held in commemora
tion of that man. Selecti6ns at the 
organ and piano illustrated these 
speeches which were entitled "Schu
bert, A Young Centenarian and 
Schubert, The Supreme Composer." 
March 10 was devoted to "Milestones 
in Musical History; "Scandinavian 
Music was discussed on March 17. 
"American Folk Music an unusual 
subject was discussed on March 24. 
The last of the lectures, of more spe
cific nature than those immediately 
preceding was an appreciation of a 
great French Symphony! which was 
entitled A Great French Symphony,

Free Tuition 
Free Trips to Europe 
Extra Cash 
Vacation Positions
Students of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology have earned nearly 
36-9,000.00 of their expenses during the 
eight months between July 1 and 
Marchl this year, according to a re
port issued by the student employ
ment bureau. For doing part-tlirie 
work that has ranged from caring for 
children to addressing social Invita
tions and regrets for milady, co-eds of 
Carnegie during the eight months 
period have earned $10,G77.7G. Men 
students, according to the report, have 
performed wide vareties of part-time 
employment such as giving their 
blood to hospital patients and serving 
as pall-bearers to earn a total of $59- 
179.GO during the same period.
A staff of three people is at work 
under the direction of John D. Beatty, 
secretary of the Bureau of Recom
mendations, to find part-time employ
ment for Carnegie students. An 
average of 400 new jobs are found for 
day students each month of the col
lege, and between 150 and 300 new 
jobs are found for women students 
each month, according to the report 
Nearly 300 male students have perma
nent part-time jobs secured by the 
bureau and eighty co-eds have been 
placed in permanent part-time jobs.
Since July 1, the report shows, a 
total of 2,338 jobs have been secured 
for men students and 1480 have been 
found for women students. Although 
the average compensation earned on 
part-time jobs is small, the bureau has 
found numerous part-time positions 
that have paid the students compara
tively well. A student who was employed as a chemist for part-time 
work one month was paid .$100.00. 
Another student, at work on a civil 
engineering development, earned $85 
toward his current expense one 
month.
Several other students earn from 
$25.00 to $75.<90 a month regularly on 
permanent part-time employment dur
ing the college year.
Waiting on table is the most com
mon form of part-time employment 
secured for the men students. Dur
ing the eight months period, 1,525 
positions as waiters were secured for 
men who earned a total of $15,448, 37 
for such work during that period, for 
an average of more than $10.00 for 
each job. On thirteen occasions since 
July; students are served as blood 
transfusion donors. Four students 
served as pall-bearers one month. 
Other positions filled by male stu
dents were as artists attendants, 
chauffeurs, carpenters, clerks, drafts
men, electricians, gardners, guard
ians, musicians, mechanics, painters, 
printers, salesmen, teachers, ushers, 
and house cleaners.
To earn more than $10,000.00 during 
the reported period, women students 
have filled part-time positions as art 
assistants, attendants, clerks, demon
strators, models, entertainers, writers, 
saleswomen, waitresses, sewers, 
shoppers, stenographers, teachers, and 
ushers. Recently, it is reported, 
spciety matrons have been using co
eds to address invitations to social 
functions and similar work involved 
in social activities.
R. Graham, a contributor to The 
Puppet, is one of the winners in the 
College Humor $2,000 art contest for 
the best drawing submitted in black 
and white by any undergraduate in 
the United States. He will be award
ed a prize of special drawing equip
ment, ,and his name appears along 
with the other winners in the May is
sue of College Humor.
More than 10.050 drawings were sub
mitted by 1,600 artists in this nation
wide contest. Maurice Lichtenstein, 
of the Michigan Gargoyle, was award
ed first prize, and will receive an Es
sex speedabout in any paint job he 
specifies. Each drawing was criti
cized by the internationally famous 
illustrators, James Montgomery Flagg, 
Arthur William Brown, Gaar Wil
liams, and by H. N. Swanson, Editor, 
and Tom Burroughs, art editor, of 
College Humor magazine. The judges 
spoke very highly of the quality of 
the work that was submitted.
Flagg, speaking for the judges, said 
that as a whole, the cartoons were far 
superior to the illustrations and decorative art work, which was expected. 
In the case of the first fifteen winners, 
the judges agreed unanimously. He 
deplored the widespread evidences of 
imitative effort. "The prize winners 
have a style of their own, no matter 
how strongly they sympathize with 
older artists. They know what they 
want to say in line, and they say it.
College Humor expects to find a 
place for some of the work of these 
young artists, because it is a part of 
its plan to keep everlastingly in search 
of new artists and writers for its mag
azine of Youth.

ERY frequently wells, even though 
drilled through known water-bearing 
strata, will not yield sufficient water. Only 
a few pores or crevices intersected by the 
drilling supply any water. Certain blast
ing methods will open up all of the fissures 
for a considerable distance in all directions, 
thereby greatly increasing the supply of 
water.
But such blasting requires very careful 
procedure. For instance, questions arise 
as to the proper depth of the charge; the 
amount and kind of explosives to load; the 
methods of loading and firing charges, and 
other details associated with blasting.
Do you know how to make a jack 
squib, or how to prepare a nitroglycerin 
charge to explode by means of an electric 
blasting cap, or how to make a dynamite 
torpedo?
The details of a great many blasting opera

Gentlemen:
Please send me a copy of your Blasters Handbook.
To the Editor.
Dear Sir:
Tearing aside the veil of ignorance 
and ruthlessly turning the searchlight 
of truth upon heretofore unmentioned 
facts seems to be the spirit of this 
modern age of frank and outspoken 
people; so, to be in keeping with the 
times, at least in a mild form, it is 
my earnest desire to here set forth 
certain facts as I see them .concerning 
the Carnegie spirit. For years, Car
negie has been famous for its spirit. 
At all times, the school has been com
mended for the loyal and true feeling 
of comradeship developed within its 
portals, but, have these commenda
tions been well founded or are they 
the result of mere outward appear
ance put on by the students? In my 
opinion, they are falsely grounded and 
it is well nigh time something was 
done to check the hypocrisy and hum
bug now in order. The internal strife 
within our institution has grown to 
tremendous proportions in the last 
few years. It is plain to be seen that 
without co-operation between the vari
ous schools, true spirit is an idle 
dream. Consider the schools main
tained on our campus. We have Arts 
School, the center of all' the discord, 
pitted against the other threeEn
gineering, Margaret Morrison and In
dustries. Anyone outside of the 
chosen group (the arts students con
ception) is merely a poor misguided 
human, struggling to fill his or her 
mind with knowledge, and losing sight 
of the very essence of life itself. The 
Engineers and Maggie Murphs, be
cause they have not burdened them
selves with silly temperaments and' 
affectations, are, in the eyes of the 
Arts student, something to be pitied 
rather than appreciated. Wherein the 
cause for this arises still remains a 
mystery to me after three years re
search. We are all ground ' through 
high school in the customary style, 
just average human beings with av
erage ideas, capacities and tendencies, 
but alas, some feel the great urge to
wards the artistic and are then mer
rily on their way towards the finished 
product now under discussion. Why 
they feel it necessary to suddenly as
sume such idiotic, eccentric disposi
tions will continue to baffle me, un
less there be a kindhearted soul in 
their midst who might take the time 
and pains to explain it. I am in no 
way atempting to discount the artist, 
but merely searching for a clue that 
might solve a great myster-y. As I 
said earlier in my harangue, until we 
have harmony between the schools, 
true Carnegie spirit will be impossi
ble.

Two years ago mv wife gave me an expensive pipe. I smoked it a great deal for two or three weeks, put it aside, then began smoking it again. This 
time it was very strong. Veterans told me that it had been smoked too hard 
for a new pipe and should be put away.The pipe was laid away again. A short time ago I got it out and smoked one of the common brands of tobacco 
in it. The results were disappointing. I told the druggist of my experience with it. He asked if I had tried Edge- worth. I told him I never had. I followed his suggestion, and I am honest when I say that it has restored the 
sweetness to the pipe, and has made me wonder. Was it the pipe or the brand of tobacco that caused me to lay it away for the long period of time?As a novice, I prefer Edgeworth. I 
am going to stick to it, as I feel satisfied that there is none better on the market.

By JOE B. PATTERSON
The orchestra concert of the Pitts
burgh Symphony in Syria Mosque last 
Sunday night was one of the most sat
isfying ever heard in this city, and 
worthy of the capacity audience it at
tracted. The guest soloist was Mar
garet Matzenauer, Metropolitan Opera 
contralto, who sang several fine num
bers.
The orchestra was strictly Pitts
burgh with Elias Breeskin conducting 
and Charles Marsh in the concertmasters chair, and a more competent, 
enthusiastic organization would be 
hard to find. It was Breeskins first 
appearance as the orchestras con
ductor, but as associate conductor he 
directed rehearsals and was largely 
responsible for the fine work of other 
concerts.
There was a noticeable increase in 
confidence, much more volume re
source, and even better tone in some 
divisions than was manifest' in the 
February concert. This might be at
tributable to longer rehearsal time, 
but it certainly is an improvement. 
The choice of program also contribut
ed largely to the success and enjoy
ment of the concert.
In memory of the late Carl Bernthaler, one of the early spirits in the 
movement for a symphony orchestra 
here, the orchestra played the prelude 
to Wagners The Meistersingor. It 
was played with unusual feeling; its 
swinging, stirring passages were put 
oVer in a grand style, and the full or
chestra ending was thrilling.
The symphony was the popular 
Beethoven Fifth. The opening 
movement was done con brio with 
many a thought for the memorable 
phrases. The second movement was a 
triumph. The whole work, however, 
was well done.
There was a pianissimo effulgence 
to the strings in the Bizet Adagietto 
that was gratifying to hear. To Jan 
Falclc, second violinist, in the orches
tra, goes much or the credit for the 
virtuoso performance of Kreislers 
Tambourin Chinois. He arranged it 
for orchestra and it was played for the 
first time. He gave it vivid colorings 
and his instrumentation was very 
clever. Ptfrcy Graingers familiar 
Shepherds Hey" went merrily along, 
and the audience liked it well enough 
to warrant a repetition.
Matzenauer sang Oh don fatale" 
from Verdis "Don Carlos in her rich 
tones and dramatic style, and was 
well received. She encored with a 
Schumann number.
The final concert of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Society will be given April 
22 with Eugene Goosens as guest con
ductor, and Moriz Rosenthal as piano 
soloist.

A lasting memory of a great artist 
was left by Mme. Ernestine Schumann-Heink through her farewell con
cert in .Pittsburgh Monday night in 
Syria Mosque. The hall was almost 
filled for her and the resounding ap
plause, rising tribute and floral gifts 
indicated that many in the audience 
were old friends.
It was an intimate recital of old 
songs made more intimate by remarks 
of the singer. True, Mme. SchumannHeink was not in the finest of voice. 
The cold that bothers her at times se
riously interfered with her tones and 
she often punctuated phrases with 
smothered coughs. In spite of this, 
the appealing voice and style that has 
endeared her to thousands still was 
evident to the delight of her audience 
who listened to the great artist- for 
perhaps the last time.
One cannot forget easily the charm 
of her middle register which is most 
effective in expressive songs of wild 
proportions and the character she con
veys with yoice, facial expression and 
gestures.
Outside of the dramatic "Erlking 
with which she encored her first 
group, and Waltrautes Narrative" 
from Wagners Gotterdammerung, 
her numbers were the short, impres
sive things that she long has featured 
on her programs. Her interpretation 
of the Erlking still Is stirring. She 
brought out the depth of her lower 
register In Frank La. Torges Before 
the Crucifix, and her facial expres
sion was very amusing in Schuberts 
"The Borelli.
She was at her best in the grand old 
German cradle song, Wiegenlied," by 
Brahms and in Huerters Pirate 
Dreams. Another fine, lilting thing 
she sang, was Malloys Kerry Dance 
and of course, her program would not

, and tennis candidates settle down to final training for the seasons now so 
near at hand. Of the track team, the quarter milers, candidates for the relay 
team, are facing the hardest grind, for time trials for the team to compete at 
the Penn relays two weeks from Saturday, will be held very shortly, and the 
i trip to Philadelphia is a real incentive to hard work.

M a pleasant contrast to the situation facing other football coaches in 
the Tri-State district, Bob Waddell will thin afternoon face the tank of put
ting1 forty or more very promising football players through a period of train
ing designed to afford him an opportunity to start fitting together next fall's 
football machine.Our neighbors on the hill have been at spring practice for several weeks 
now, and are daily sending bales of mournful copy to newspapers in the city,
 toiit their situation, too, is a pleasant one. Minus several HtarH, but with 
plenty of substitute and freshman material, the Panther coaches are secretly 
1 counting upon another champlOnsnip eleven next fall.During the last week Of school preceding vacation, the final chapter of 
) the intramural basket ball season was cloned, with Theta Xi proud possessors 
of the championship title.; The winners are fully deserving of the laurels they liave won, having
, readied the championship height through Hheer merit. Congratulations are 
f <lud Phi, Kappa and McGill jjall, too, for though defeated In the finals, they 
j came through their regular. league .schedules undefeated.
! Thus ends one of the most successful intramural seasons witnessed at
Carnegie since the system was instituted. Intramural contests, whether
 swimming, track or basket ball, accomplish a great amount of good for the 
( school; fostering a spirit of friendly competition among its students, and 
1 often bringing to light} men of varsity caliber. *******
And now comes a really tough taskthat of selecting the annual all-star 
intramural basket ball teams. As given below, they arc the product of the 
joint opinions of ye scribe, a referee and a number of players and spectators. 
No explanations nor alibis for selections will be given. Let it suffice to say 
that many a good man has probably gone unmentioned, but the selections 
were made as falHy and impartially as possible. Few honorable mentions 
 areTim'adt; and those only to men who were about on a par with men selected 
for a team.

season.
The varsity lost a match to the !
Oklahoma A. & M. college R. O. T. C. j 
team during the same week. In this ' 
match the Oklahoma team took the j 
advantage of using freshmen and not ; 
requiring eligibility rules, since they j 
fired as an R. O. T. C. team rather i 
than a varsity team.
Although the Carnegie team was 
short of material and without any ex- J 
perience in the new standing position I 
prescribed by the rules this year, it j 
fought along against these odds, and ! 
came out at the end of the season with ! l)0rts that the first woman lawyer to 
almost an even break; having 14 wins ; I)ractice in the United States was 
and 1G losses. The schedule this year j ^ara Kilgore Wertman, who graduwas also very difficult because when j ate^ fiom Law at Michigan in 71. 
it -was made up the prospects favored
! With the defeat of its last two opI ponents, Cornell University and the 
j University of Kansas, the girls rifle 
I team closes a very successful season.
| Out of eighteen matches, fired against 
| many of the best girls rifle teams in 
| the country, the Carnegie girls have 
won fourteen, a record held by very 
few college teams. Not only have the 
girls shown up well in the weekly 
matches, but they have also made an
as good if not a better team than last 
year, and the changes in the rules 
were also unknown.
Three of the numeral men from last 
. year were a great help to the team 
this year. Kasehagen placed in every 
match, and Lippert was third high 
man for the season. Stine, the third 
numeral man from last year placed in 
all the matches the first semester, but 
became ineligible, and his consistent 
scoring was thus lost to the team the 
second semester. Much credit is due 
to Bronson for his consistent high 
scores which were a great aid to the 
weakened team. He also placed in 
every match this season, being high 
man in many of them.
The lineup for the last match was:

Cirnegie Netmen To 
Begin Practicing
Tennis, although a minor sport at 
Carnegie, almost ranks with the ma
jors, and each spring great interest is 
shown in this popular outdoor 
time. This years team should be a 
good one, as there are four letter 
men of last year who will play this 
season. Captain Joe Schmid, Glasser, 
Hooper and Carpenter are the men 
around whom Coach Hoover expects 
to build a winning aggregation.
Practice will officially start this 
week unless weather conditions pre
vent. In the meantime, many of 
those aspiring to varsity positions are 
working out daily in the gymnasium, 
so that if the courts are not dry when 
practice begins, they will be used to 
working indoors.
The schedule this season is a very 
formidable one and some of the 
strongest teams in the East will be 
played. The Eastern trip, which will 
take place during the second week of 
May, includes matches with the Uni
versity of Princeton, New York U. 
and Penn State. These are about 
the toughest that the Plaid will have 
to meet and it is hoped they will do so 
with success.
Kambach, captain of last years 
Freshman squad, will be eligible for 
varsity play this Reason. He was the 
most outstanding man theFrosh had,

The following extract from Dr. 
Baker's annual report is a brief sum
mary of what the president of the 
college believes regarding the trend 
of requirements for men who will fill 
future industrial capacities and the 
consequent training required for 
those who are planning an engineer
ing career.
! We may assume that business orj ganizatrbns will be bigger; that the 
duties of all forms of employees, both ! 
mechanical and administrative, will 
I be more nearly standardized than is 
I the case eVen today; that specializa-!
, lion will become narrower and more '
I intensive. If this guess is a correct I 
I one, the individual is likely to be a j 
j smaller unit in a greater organism, j 
i His duties are likely to be more defl| nitely prescribed and to offer Jlfewer 
opportunities for initiative and origl*
I nality. On the other hand, the need | 
J of original, energetic, commanding j 
j minds to manage these greater or-1 
i ganizations will be very real. in 
other words, the responsibilities am 
I rewards for the leaders of the lulur 
j are likely to increase while the loppoiy

Cardo Chardon Disentoolle.
Thistledown is hand in glove with 
arise which may change the present j friend the editor about the silly
driftsome new factor in industry, 
some new scientific discoverywhich | Week, 
will give back to the individual a 
wider freedom of movement. The 
chances for rising will be fewer, while 
the benefits to those who have the j

But Thistledown would like
to point out that it is no worse for the 
student council to allow fraternities 
their! Hell Week than it is for the 
student council and the administra* 
strength to break through the level!tion of c- ' T- t0 all0w Ule s0PhI of mediocrity will be larger.
rf this assumption be true, educamores to clip a plebes head. As 
! Thistledown has pointed out before,
Hell Week is really one of the hap
piest periods of a mans college 
course, that it leaves abundant pleas
ant memories for future years. This
tledown wonders whether twenty-five 
swats nightly laid on for a week by 
a muscular arm wielding a paddle 
long, wide and thick leaves anything 
except soreness, lameness, and black 
and blue spaces. And Thistledown 
wonders whether any Tech man can 
be such a fool as to actually enjoy rej In connection with the problem of 
| increasing tax rates the rising cost of 
education is being carefully scrutiniz
ed in many states.
In Massachusetts, at a meeting in 
I Boston of school committee members 
j with officials of the State Department 
of Education, especial attention was 
given to this subject and the facts and 
figures presented purposes to show 
that this rising cost is by no means 
out of proportion to increasing costs 
in otheV directions.
The rising cost amounts to an in
crease Of* but 54 per cent over the 
past 15 years, if consideration is taken 
of the vastly increased number of 
pupils and of the depreciated dollar, 
according to figures just released for 
Massachusetts, which is said to sup| port one of the most expensive educa
tional plants in the United States.
The conference itself is understood 
j to represent an almost unique trend 
j in educational procedure, indicating a 
closer co-operation between the lay
man, represented by the school com| mittees, and the professional in edu
cation, in order that the transport of 
the latter may be tempered by the 
practical approach of the former. The 
meeting was one of the six to be held 
during the pVesent year for a discus

elementary, secondary and normal 
schools, declared that "school expen
diture, even though rising, increases 
the wealth ^)f the country quite out of 
proportion to other public expendi
tures.
He then produced figures to show 
that the pupil enrollment of the ele
mentary schools had increased 105 
per cent in the last 50 years, while 
the high school enrollment had jump
ed from 15,000 to 133,000, an increase 
of 746 per cent in the same period. 
This, coupled with the fact that the 
dollar is worth but 61 cents on its 
1912 basis, is largely responsible for 
educations rising cost, he said.
Critics of rising cost do not con
sider the enormous enrichment of cur
riculum, necessary to prepare the 
child for the complexities of modern 
life, Mr. Wright said. If it were an
nounced that the modern high school 
curriculum was to be reduced to what 
it was 50 years ago, half of the pupils 
would walk out the same.day. "
Mr. Wright concluded with- what he 
called the chewing gum argument, 
pointing out' that little more than 30 
per cent of what is being spent for 
luxuries would pay for all school 
costs. He showed also, that where the 
wage of the American people had in
creased from $47,000,000,000 yearly to 
$90,000,000,000, that school costs rep
resented less than $4 out of every $100

week, one of the Senior Civils quoted 
Mr. John A. Widstoe, formerly Presi
dent of the Utah and of the Agricul
tural College of Utah, as saying that 
the present curricula of technical 
schools are too technical and of so 
narrow a range that the graduate is 
not able to make the best use of his 
training in a world of men and women, 
touching the many and varied activi
ties of life."
This indictment does not stand 
alone. That the engineering graduate 
fares so poorly in financial returns 
for his services, probably arises from 
the fact that however highly skilled 
he may be in technology, he is usually 
woefully ignorant in matters of econ
omic policy. Wellingtons famous

of doing well for one dollar what any 
bungler can do for two after a fash

Without desiring in the least to 
derogate the meritorious efforts of 
the faculty in the presentation of 
these subjfects to classes that are 
often indifferent to or prejudiced 
against the courses, it is the belief 
of the writer that they could be made 
more effective by unifying or co-ordi
nating them under a single director- 1 
ate instead of presenting them as by
products of three departments. Such 
factors in the development of engin
eering projects as the acquisition of 
legal rights, the command and devel
opment of markets, promotion and or
ganization problems, questions of 
finance, maintenance, depreciation, 
obsolescence, and operation, and prob
lems of management are closely con
nected and should be studied as a 
unit rather than in a hit-or-miss 
fashion.
No doubt there are practical con
siderations w'liich would obstruct the 
introduction of such a plan of instruc
tion. But in the face of such criti
cism as Mr. Widstoes, any step in 
this direction would be salutary.
