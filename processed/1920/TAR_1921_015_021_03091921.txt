(By Secretary)
The Athletic Drive has brought oui 
many questions. and criticisms which 
seem to be ever present in the minds 
of some of the graduates and former 
students. Most criticisms arise 
through lack of true information and 
contact with Tech and Tech affairs. 
If the alumni body knew Tech as it 
should, nothing but valuable construc
tive criticism for the betterment of 
the institution would result. It was 
with the idea of bringing all the 
alumni in closer contact and making 
them better acquainted with the 
iacts concerning Tech, that the Tar
tan is sent to paid-up alumni members. 
Four issues of the Tartan were sent 
to all graduates and former students 
during the fall season of last year, ad
vising them to join the Alumni Asso
ciation and take advantage of this op
portunity to re-establish contact with 
their Alma Mater.
 The Administration realizes that the 
alumni have never been considered to 
any great extent until a year or so 
ago, nor has the alumni as a whole 
given much constructive advice or 
criticism on the management of Tech.
During the football season of 1919, 
conditions, pertaining to inter-collegi
ate sports, became so unsatisfactory 
nnder the existing management, due 
perhaps directly to the mye financial 
condition of the Institute, that the 
graduates and students1,' who knew the 
real conditions, thought something 
ought to be done. After a great deal 
of work on the part of a small com
mittee composed of students, alumni 
and administration, the Administra
tion agreed to turn inter-collegiate 
athletics oVer to an Athletic Council 
to be composed of four alumni mem. bers, two from the general alumni 
body and two from "the Varsity Clan 
(an organization of men who earned 
a Varsity letter) three members from 
the student body, and three members 
from the administration and faculty.
This body was duly elected and to 
it fell the burden of raising the bud' get to carry on athletic program at 
Tech. The athletic field and old gym 
on Woodlawn avenue were turned! 
over to the new Athletic Association. 
Funds were; furnished by the Admin
istration to carry out the existing con
tracts for the year 1919-1920 season. 
Mr. Frank H. Haaren was elected 
graduate manager and he at once fell 
heir to the mistakes and criticisms 
which arose from the Old regime. The 
football schedule for the 1920 season 
had in the meantime been arranged by 
Dr. Marks and such other colleagues 
x as were about school and interested 
enough t.o see that athletics were not 
forgotten,, notwithstanding that it was 
uncertain whether there would be an
other football season or funds avail
able for carrying out any sort of pro
gram. The Council decided that it 
must depend upon the alumni and 
students to back the new organization 
and provide a capital fund to guaran
tee athletics over a period of one or 
two years until they could be-put on 
a paying basis. The students pledged 
and paid S5.00 each to the program 
(even the girls and most of the night 
men) notwithstanding that they had 
already paid an athletic fee included 
in the tuition for the year. The 
amount thus raised among the stu
dents was |10,000.
WHAT DID THE ALUMNI' DO? 
Out of 2700 graduates and former stu
dents canvassed, 250 responded to the 
amount of $3,000 a year. This cer- tainly was a disheartening blow to 
students and Athletic Council who had 
counted much on the alumni support. 
However, those interested felt that 
perhaps the program had not been

CONCERT AT MT. WASHINGTON
Friday evening last marked the 
seventh appearance of the Musical 
Clubs this year in formal concert. The 
concert was given under the auspices 
of the Womens Missionary Society, in 
the Mt. Washington Presbyterian 
church, and was one of the most suc
cessful yet given. The church was 
well filled by a very attentive and ap
preciative. audience who recalled the 
clubs for encores on nearly every se
lection.
Reilley, accompanied by the clever 
instrumental sextet from the Mandolin 
Club, made a decided hit with his in
termission specialty. His inimitable 
interpretation of popular and charac
ter songs and the jazzy work of the 
sextet brought an especially demon
strative bit of applause. The Glee 
Club quartet also met with a deserved
ly cordial reception, their numbers 
being exceptionally brilliant and well 
executed. This concert was one of the 
best rendered' this season and the 
constant improvement in the work of 
the clubs shows that the home con
cert, which marks the culmination of 
the seasons efforts, will be well 
worth hering. ,
THE PLEBE JIG
The Plebes of Arts are surely 
spreading themselves in arranging for 
the Plebe Jig, which promises to al
most equal the Ball.
The program is a treat in these 
tifes of the high cost of printing. Re
freshments which have never before 
been attempted will be had while they 
last. The dramatic department is 
working up'the list of stunts which 
were censored in Ship Ahoy, and 
the Harrison-Hollins Melody Boys 
have been secured at an additional 
expense. A big surprise is still under 
cover.
All Arts are invited to this dance, 
the only requirement being that regis
tration cards must be presented.

The annual extravaganza Ship 
Ahoy was presented last Friday and 
Saturday to two large audiences. The 
performances were both run off 
smoothly and snappy. There were 
very few delays or mistakes which 
usually characterize amateur produc
tions. The Fhow was clever and en
tertaining, but there is a slight evi
dence of the need1 of more rehears
ing. The songs were good. Some 
hits were Wedding Bells, Ship 
Ahoy and We Are the Villains.
Hertz and Gaither were funny any 
received a good hand. Jack Willard, 
Mary Lissfelt, Eddee Reid, Hans Mul
ler, A1 Spess, Carolyn Mering, Peg 
Harmon and Dot* Schell were some 
of the principal characters whose 
acting was good.
The jazz orchestra received the 
best applause. They played some of 
the new songs written by Schmertz. 
Mr. Schmertz also (played in the 
'band.
_Most of the credit for the succejs 
of the show is due John Todd, presi

CHESS CLUB PLAYS P. C. C.
On Wednesday evening last, the 
Carnegie Chess Club entertained sev
en members of the Pittsburgh Chess 
Club in the Faculty Club room. 
Smokes were provided and refresh
ments were served.
The P. C. C. members played an 
informal match with C. I. T. Carne
gie men made the following scores:
Powell2 out of 2 from Cheeseman.
Horeliclc21 out of 3 from Taylor.
Cuth'bert2 out of 4 from George.
DoudenI out of 1 from Paisley.
Ragsdale0 out of 2 from Haney.
Watt, Jablousky and Panneck ldst 
to Furst, who played the three games 
simultaneously. Johnson did , not 
finish his game with Smith before 
the meet adjournd. Totals:
P. C. C.................................8
C. I. T. .................. ...........7
It is not to be understood that the 
above named gentlemen constitute a 
represenative team for the Pitts
burgh Chess Club, although all of 
them are strong players. On the 
other hand, some of the Carnegie 
pliers make no pretension of being 
any&ing but novices to the game. 
Some significance may he put on the 
fact that this same group from the 
P. C. C., with but few exceptions, 
.held the Pitt Chess Club to a very 
small score a few weeks ago. The 
prospects for a strong team to send 
up to Pitt in the near future are 
promising from ever/ angle.
An attempt is being made to sched
ule future matches with Columbia, j 
Harvard, Yale; West Point, Cornell,' 
University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh 
and W. & J.
The Chess Club has lately been' 
recognized by the Student Council, an' 
indication, at least,- that it is some
thing  worth while.

PRACTICE HOUSE TEA
The girls and faculty at the Practice 
House entertained the Sophomores of 
the Household Economics Department 
at tea Friday afternoon.
These teas are one of the many 
joys of the department, and furnish 
an excellent opportunity for its mem

Something new was introduced in 
the history of four School assemblies 
when last Wednesday was held in 
the Langley Lab., Instead of the Music 
Hall as has been the custom. The 
meeting was devoted entirely to a 
talk from the president of the school 
on the Athletic drive. In his appeal to 
the student body to put some pep  
and ginger behind this drive and 
put it over, be discussed briefly the 
status of athietics at Tech since the 
school began to th present date. He 
told how in the beginning the stu
dents gave money in order that Tech 
could have athletic teams, of how the 
present field house was built of sec
ond hand material for temporary use 
only, and of last years Athletic fund. 
This fund/' he said, was used to' 
clear up all debts so that the Athletic 
Council could take charge of athletics 
with a clean slate.
This drive, he continued, needs 
the undivided aid of every student at 
Tech. I am not criticising you, I am ap
pealing to you to go in partnership 
with me and put this drive across. We 
must not fail, for if we do, Pittsburgh 
will lose its confidence in us. I want 
you to sell Tech to Pittsburgh as I 
am trying to sell Tech to you. We do 
not want charity, what we do want is 
their interest and their willingness to 
back up Tech athletics. If every stu
dent here will pledge themselves to 
see three or more persons, this drive 
will be a success.
Buddy Overand, the next speaker, 
and the one man who had done more 
for Tech than any other man in this 
drive, pointed out that of the 2,000 
pledges that had been counted on by 
the committee from the students, only 
v700 have been turned in. Only ?3u, 
500 has been pledged to date, he said, 
and if the students had secured the 
number of pledges that we counted 
on them for, this drive would now 
have been a thing of the past. Lei 
us buckle down to real business for 
the remainder of this drive and show 
Pittsburgh that when Tech starts out 
to do a thing, she does it.
DOUGHNUTS AND COFFEE
The Household Ec. Club had real 
Maggie Murph doughnuts and coffee 
on sale Tuesday. The few Juniors 
who made them, thought twenty 
doughnuts were several doughnuts, 
but soon found theyd madn only about 
half enough. Come early next time 
so you wont miss thern^
The last game for Tech on the 
home floor, played last Thursday 
night, turned out to be a victory for 
the Tartans, after a hard fought bat
tle, the scoye being 34 for Tech and 
31 for Bucknell. The night before 
Bucknell defeated Pitt by the same 
margin that they themselves were der 
feated by Tech.
The game was a close contest 
throughout, the score being tied early 
in the game 4-4, and the first half 
closed with Tech 15 and Bucknell 14. 
Out of a total of 29 points made by 
both teams in the first half 17 were 
made on foul ...oals. Dosey of Tech. 
and Bihl of Bucknell, shooting 9 out 
of 10 aud 8 out of 9,. respectively. 
However, they did not maintain this 
record in the second half.'
The second half opened with Dosoy 
scoring from the middle of the floor, 
thus gifing Tech the start on the last 
lap. Bucknell, however, was soon on 
the heels of the Tech men, and the 
game was nip and tuck to the last.
Dosey and IvIoPhee both played tho 
floor well while Gibson and, Pittman 
held off their men at guard, and with 
Bell succeeded in 'breaking up the 
breaking up the passing of Bucknell.

EMPIRE STATE CLUB
An organization meeting was held 
last Thursday nite and much enthusi
asm was shown. About twenty-five 
students were present including a 
good representation from M. M. D.
The object of this club was dis
cussed and many constructive ideas 
were presented. At the next meet
ing, Thursday, March 10, officers will 
be elected, the constitution adopted 
and plans will be gotten under way 
for the first so'cial affair. All stu
dents attending this meeting will be 
charter members providing they pass 
the requirements. All New York 
Staters be at the next meeting and 
start the club off -with a hang, 
Thursday, March 11.
The greatest affair that will be at
tempted by the combined four schools 
this year will occur In the Middle 
of May when all will join in enjoy
ing Campus Week. A. C. May, gen
eral chairman, has announced May
12, 13 and 14 as the dates for this 
most auspicious affair and has sur
rounded himself .with committeemen 
many of whom were responsible for 
the successful Campus Week of 1920. 
The student hody must now begin to 
think about the coming celebration. 
Each individual must plan his part 
in this activity. The services of 
every student will be needed in some 
way or other if Campus Week is to 
be the most that can be made of it.
Last years Camjpus Week sur
passed in its success oven the most 
optimistio hopes of its workers. The 
student body emerged from it know
ing that it had spent the happiest 
days of tlie year and had enjoyed 
Tech as never before. The alumni 
and friends of Tech were so pleased 
that they promised a full attendance 
at the next Campus Woelc.
This years Campus Week will be 
attempted on a larger scalo than tlie 
celebration of a year ago. The short 
comings of last year can he profited 
by in the working out of this years 
program. Last week a joint meet
ing of the committee chairmen was 
held and tho iplans U2-e now well un
der way for this years Campus 
Week. Although tho scope of tho 
affair for 1921 will bo about tho 
same as for 1920 yet there will bo 
many changes and improvements In 
the various events that will malco 
the 1921 celebration a never-to-beforgotten porlod In the annals of 
Tech.
Among tho various evonts and hap
penings might bo named, tho start off 
Goneral Assembly, Tap Day oxercises, athlotic activities including 
Ibaseball, tonnls and track meets, an 
open air concert hy the combined mu
sical clubs, a stroet carnival rivalling 
In splendor the annual dazzling af

various clans, alumni organizations,

STUDENT COUNCIL REPORT
Several important things were 
taken up at tlie meeting of the Stu
dent Council last week. Miss McCarson submitted a calendar of the major 
social functions which will take place 
next year. C. B. Schmidt reported 
that contractors were being solicited 
for bids on the plebe caps for next 
year.
The Teknon Club was given the 
power to handle all charities and to 
take care of ail requests of that na
ture. 'Schmidt was appointed to con
fer with Dean Tarbell in regard to ob
taining a graduate manager of nonathletic activities for Tech. The Tech 
Chess Club was given recognition as 
a campus organization. The Empire

Marlowes Dr. (Faustus. tho latost 
production of the School of Drama, 
furnishes an opportunity to View a 
work of tho best known of Shakes
peares immediate predecessors. Tho 
play itself is amazingly crude, clumsy 
and naive, ovon when one remembers 
that It dates from,the flushed dawn of 
the Elizabethan drama. In awkward 
chronicle-fashion, with frankly exposi
tory choruses, the tragedy traverses 
the history of Faustus from his first 
dabbling in magic and his signing 
away of his soul to Lucifer, through 
the twenty-four years of his power, to 
the Doctor's descent into a gratifyingly lurid Hell-mouth. Of tho first rate, 
there are two passages, the apostro
phe to Helen, and the death scene, 
though the opening soliloquy and the 
signing of the pact are impressive. The 
rest is childs play and trickery, cal
culated perhaps to thrill Elizabethan 
groundlings, but destined in these in
credulous times to raise a smile. And 
if the haling away to Hell makes us 
titter rather than tremble, it is, per
haps , that Hell has been for some time 
a subject for vaudeville humors rather 
than soul-searching. Nevertheless, 
the play is, as the society column 
might say, appropriate for the Lenten 
season.
Of this uneven and not always ad
mirable material, Mr. Frederic McCon* 
nell and his assistants have made a 
beautiful and memorable production. 
The production makes elaborate use 
of some Of the modern continental 
methods of stylization. Here we have 
the eco'nomy of the permanent frame, 
lighting, in the main, indirect, a fairly 
illusive lise of the cyclorama, and a 
reasonably complete suppression of 
footlights. The simple blaqk and back
ground sets off the rich costumes, and 
furnishes in various lights excellent 
compositions. The confirmed realist 
Oiay object that the nervous toying 
with the lights destroys tho Illusion, 
but tho ob.vlous reply Is that If this 
shilling shockor may not persuado, It 
may at least thrill. It cannot bo said 
that\the sophisticated Incidental mu
sic assists tho Illusion.
Marlowe's play, like other works of 
this precocious youngster, contains 
one real role. Mr. Russell Collins 
finds in Dr. Faustus, a part as prom
inent and onerous as his Everyman 
last year. His voice has considerable 
range, which he uses with skill in the 
sustained speeches. His lively intel
ligence carries him through some te
dious! speeches, and in the (powerful 
deat>', scene, his resourceful/gestures

GRAD. MANAGER OF ACTIVITIES
A graduate managor of Student Ac
tivities was tho main topic of discus
sion at tho Studont Activities board 
mooting last Wodnosday. Coincident 
with tho need of some ono to super
vise such ovonts as are not covorod 
by tho graduate managor or athletics, 
as oxprossod by Doan Tarbell at tho 
recent Science smblcor, several of tho 
difficulties Involved In securing a full 
time manager wore mentioned. That 
such an addition to 8he administrative 
forces will havo to bo made within a 
short time is bocofnlng dally moro evi
dent; for nolthor tho students nor 
those of tho administration now in 
charge can do justice to tho situation 
arising. It was proposod that all mat
ters placed In the hands of tho future 
managor engage his services on a 
percentage basis. Tho students In 
presenting Ship Ahoy wore forced to 
engage the sorvices of a down town 
agency which would havo proven un
necessary with a full time managor 
on the campus. Other activities are 
continually running up against tho 
same situation. Mr. King, a Tech 
graduatfi, was suggested for the posi
tion and tho matter was referred to 
the general committee in full co-oper
ation with the Student Council.
Mr. Evans reported for the commit
tee on Plebe Bibles. The present 
market price' for 2,000 copies was re
ported as $1,500 and It was decided 
to wait till after April in the hopes 
of securing better market conditions.
Miss Finklehorn reported the prizes 
for the Tech banner had been award
ed, Teasdale Barney receiving first 
prize and Miss Shirk second prize. 
Thie matter of a standard Tartan 
plaid was referred to Frank Harren.
It was reported that the books of 
the various Student Acttvtles had 
not been received for auditing. Mr. 
Smith reported for the general com
mittee that the petition from the Rifle 
Club for recognition under the board 
had been accepted. Janitor service 
for the Union was awarded to R. L. 
Pittman.
For the Musical Clubs discussion 
was favorable towards an increase In 
budget. The names of those entitled 
to insignia must be presented by 
April 1 and finally approved by June
1. Tlie matter, of Insignia for those In 
the Girls Musical Clubs was dicussed 
favorably and referred back, pending 
the design of a suitable award.
Tho aiumnl of Wilson Collego In
quired concerning tho renting of the 
Union during the Easter vacation. 
Tho request was granted.
The Night School petition for $25 to 
cover any deficits Incurred In the 
coming night school dance on March

MUSICAL CLUBS CONCERT
When the Skibo musicians of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
came to Connellsville last 'evening 
and stepped out on the stage of the 
Connellsvillo High School auditorium, 
prctlcaily every seat in the spacious 
hall was occupied. A success, do 
cidedly, and unquestionably the er 
tire evening was from a social, 
financial and a myslcal standpoint'. 
The singers and players wore apjplauded and responded willingly to 
encores on an already generous pro
gram. The soloist of the evening, 
W. J. Reilly of the Class of '21, In 
a marvelous 'baritone voice sang 
several light oporallc numbers and 
the program included comic and light 
operatic numbers with sufficientipopular music to please all types of rnuslo 
lovors. The ensemble numbers of 
the Glee- Club under the direction of 
Roy Hogdon with II. II. Burdick of 
Class '22, as accompanist and the 
Mandolin Club under S. C. Kovak, 
Jr., Cliiss of '23, were most beaut!-, 
fully executed and the. tone blending 
of the Glee Club with the excellent 
finesse of the instrumentalists were 
favorably commented upon by thmusic lovers of the city.Connell

PLEASE
Tho Tartan has endeavored this year to avoid the all too tircvalent tendency to criticise the actions oil students on the campus, 
and we have succeeded in doing so to any great extent this far. 
There is one point, however, which has been hammered on in previous 
years, and which we must continue to emphasize, it seems. That is 
the careless habit formed by some of its of disregarding entirely the 
walks provided for our use in getting from one building to another, 
 and cutting directly across the lawns on the line which is the shortt distance between the two points. Of course this saves time for 
at the moment, but anyone who will look at some of the untly barren spots which have been worn on parts of the campus 
* readily agree that tlie time saved does not to any degree compen
sate for the loss in beauty which it entails. The administration is 
doing all it can to better tlie appearance of the institution, but with
out the co-operation of the students, little of value can be accom
plished. This is not merely talk, but expresses the opinion of a ma
jority of your fellow-studcnts. For those who habitually take the 
short cut, we can only entreat you to respect the sign, Please.7
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVE?
As contemptible a trick as we have heard of in a long time was 
the one perpetrated sometime Friday night or Saturday at the Schen
ley Theater, when eight of the costumes used in the production of 
Ship Ahoy were stolen from the dressing rooms between the first 
and second performances of the show. There seems to be no clue 
s to who tlie thief could have been, although there has been a great 
al of conjecture as to the possible motive for the action. It is cer'!y difficult to believe that anyone connected with the school 1 do such a thing, oven though there was some sentiment 
st the production expressed by different portions of the school 
time to time. It seems improbable that a desire to stop the 
>romptcd the thief, as the theft ol! a single principals costume 
have far more effectually crippled the production than did the 
jig of the chorus clothcs.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that a number of costumes, of 
very little monetary value, and ol! practically no value whatever to' 
anyone not in tho theatrical business, were taken. The theory that 
someone may havo wished to copy the designs is no doubt quite com"'*,ntary,' but a.lso fpiitp., improbable. It narrows down to either 
verted idea of aj?1joke, or a piece ol spite work. Any 
' 'n^adiiiar covery of the motive for the theft, and
of tlni epBtumes tnemsoTv'os, will bo greatly appreciated by the di
rector.of the production.

INBRED INSTRUCTORS
West Point, the United States Mili
tary Academy, holds the enviable po
sition of the foremost school of mili
tary science in the world. Paralleled 
with universal renown is the criticism, 
that West Point is the most poorlyinstructed school in the country.
President Lowell, of Harvard, madethe accusation that a school of such, 
charactera school where their own. 
graduates become instructors to m 
turn teach students who later becomeinstructorswas a school hat was un
fit for the education of American, 
youth. The accusation was a chal
lenge to West Points educational sys
tem. The weakness of,the system was 
never openly admitted by the authori
ties of the Academy, but not unstrange 
it is that some, months after President 
Lowells charges a change was made.

ing into dependable moundsmen.
Coach 'Hans Wagner, was on 
hand and* gave the squad a few 
words of encouragement. Coach Wag
ner takes a deep interest in studying 
a new recruit aad urges that- the 
proper spirit will be given in order 
t  produce iho best team that Car

The men who are trying out for 
pitching are: Coe, Gould. Cutlin,
Heese, Mitchell, ''Peterson, Cappe, 
Lusky, Milan and the veterans of 
last year, McCaw, Wiess Conrad and 
Warrich.
There are a number -of men who 
have reported for practice, who are 
trying for infield and outfield posi
tions, although they have not been 
requested but are eager to give their 
throwing muscles sufficient limbering. 
It is expected the field will be in 
shape for outdoor practice after the 
Easter vacation.
Genevas much-heralded team, un
able to check tho Carnegie Tech live 
last Saturday on tho Beaver Falls 
court, lost by the score of 3G-22.

was little doubt as to tho outcome, 
tho Beaver Falls quintet being com
pletely outclassed. The first lmlE 
ended with Tech leading, 17-11.
Tightening their guarding and im
proving their pass work the Tech 
five held the Geneva llvo to eleven 
points, in the second half, while they 
themselves ran their score up to 36.

conceded by most western followers 
of the sport to be the best man south 
of the Great Lakes. The Skibo skaters 
have been continuing their hard prac
tice sessions since the Pennsylvania 
game and are in top form: Old timers, 
who have watched them lately at the 
gardens, are enthusiastic at the im
provement displayed by the men in 
their passing and shooting. The coach 
will probably Use the same lineup 
which started in the Penn game.
. Coach Iddings of the track team 
has decided to stage weekly class 
meets at the athletic field in all 
field events. Only one eveut will be 
held each week, on Thursday and

the action of tho ring committee in

to the vociferous Faustim. Miss

possible with a not wildly amusing 
clown. Mr. Paquln gives power and

Relief from tho realism of recent

tho Freshman class..."Tho Florentine
Mirror," scattered excerpts from Mr. 
SLevons Pageant of the Italian Re

tinct and lifeless premiere, the poiv 
formailoo acquired point and Inelslveness. Its rather undramallc charac
ter gave tho novlcos a chanco to speak 
blank verse, and to wear Renaissance 
clothes. Several seemod more at ease 
with the verse than in the clothes. The 
dictation was reasonably good, though 
verse, laden with allusions, might 
take second speed for the benefit of 
the normally illiterate. As all the 
new class found at least a line to say, 
only a few can be mentioned. One 
might designate as noticeable the two 
Prologues, of which Miss Osborne's 
made up by dignity for the variety of 
Miss Thompson's, Mr. Lowes ease 
and grace as Cosimo. Miss Lowes 
courageous beauty as Simonetta, Mr. 
Tallmans lucid if not impassioned

Mudgetts Ghirlandaio, Mr. Mullens

the swaggering Michael Angelo of 
Miss Ripley. The next production of 
the class will furnish, it is hoped, less

CHEER UPI WHY
WORRY ABOUT MARKS
A Fow Remarks From tho Outside 
World.
The following editorial was taken 
from the January copy of McClures 
Magazine. It ought to contain sooth
ing thoughts for about half of Tech, 
judging from appearances during the 
past week or-so.
"The Perfect Scholar."
Little Rollo, the prize pupil, some
how doesnt set the world on- fire. 
Perhaps its because his head is so 
crammed with facts that there is no 
room left  for fancies.
Letter perfection crowds out imag
ination.
History owes little to human filingcabinets. A head full of books 
isnt worth more than the books 
themselves.
We encounter more teachers 
pets on 'clerks stools than in the 
seats of the mighty.
The higger jobs go to tlie men with 
an idea or so that hasnt yet reach
ed iprint.
When more instructors aim to de
velop individuality instead of twolegged phonograph disks, fewer col
lege men will graduate from expe
rience with an A. S. S. degree.
Geniuses have notoriously made 
tiheir marks despite the predictions 
of pedants, so sovoral prominent fig
ures of history adviso you not to 
worry because youy lad Isnt, turning 
in 100 por cont reports, among whom 
ono might mention: Sir Isaac Nowton, moro or loss well known, who 
chronically remained at tho foot of 
Ills evory class. Henry Ward Beochor, who. couldn't, loam his catechism 
yet managed to become a pretty fair 
preacher; Sir Walter Scott, a novel
ist of sorts, regarded as an utterly 
hopeless duivce at. Edinburgh; a cer
tain Darwin, whoso tutors collective
ly1 agreed that a more stupid young
ster never tried their patience; and 
Doctor Chambers who produced the 
best encyclopedia of his time despite 
the fact that he was a "damned num
skull."
Whore He Was Weak.
The other day, my little cousin 
brought home his report card marked

ATHLETIC PHOTOGRAPHS
The Varsity Club room in the gym
nasium will soon be completed and 
wo need athletic pictures, banners, 
etc., for decorations. Athletic teams 
and activities have been organized at 
Tech since 1905 and we hope this no
tice will reach all Tech people having 
pictures representative of teams and 
activities from 1905 td the present 
time.
Your co-operation in sending in any 
pictures will greatly help the Varsity 
Clan and it will be the first step to
wards a larger club room in later 
years.
To help the boys that liaVe helped 
you send in to Frank H. Haaren, grad
uate manager, at once any pictures 
you might have of activities and past 
and present athletic teams.
ALUMNI TOLD OF
ATHLETIC SITUATION
(Continued From Page One.) 
submitted in the right form and 
would not concede the the alumni had 
lost THE OLD TECH SPIRIT, hue 
were only ASLEEP to the REAL 
CONDITIONS. Upon request of the 
Athletic Council, the Trustees sanc
tioned returning to the old plan of a 
separate "athletic fee approximately 
$8.00 of which was to go to the sup
port of inter-collegiate athletics, this 
fund to be the working capital of tlie 
Association.
Very few alumni members have any 
idea that the athletic budget includes 
the salaries of the graduate manager, 
the coaches for football, basket ball, 
track and baseball, grandstand, etc., 
making up deficiencies in guarantee*, 
and such expansion as is deemed ad
visable. We have been, indeed, for
tunate In holding "Wallie 'Steffen at 
a figure much lower than several 
other institutions had offered him. 
Also in having secured the services of 
such men as Honus Wagner for base
ball. and Hal Iddings, an old team 
mate of Steffen, jab basket .ball and 
track coach. We still retain the ser
vices of "Bert Munhall as trainer and 
Frank Eyman as assstant to Mr. I-Iaaren, and it may be Interesting to know 
that, the remodeling of the gymnasium 
iH'due entirely to the untiring efforts 
of "Fuzzy Eyman and "Bert Munhall, 
so that it now has a balcony entirely 
around the fioor and will seat com
fortably almost 500 with standing 
room for a great many more. In ad
dition to this, there has been a club 
room fixed up for the members of the 
Varsity teams. The plumbing of tho 
building has been completely over
hauled. The seating capacity of tho 
grandstand on the athletics field has 
boon enlarged so as to furnish addi
tional Boats for 1,200 people. All of 
tills work has been done almost en
tirely by studentB and the only ex
pense Involved being that of material. 
Admitting the success of the 1920 sea
son to have been greater than it was 
oxpected for tho first year under the 
now management, and while there re*

mained in the Association treasury 
several thousand dollars, enough to 
guarantee another year perhaps, the 
Council felt that they had no author
ity to proceed further with the pro
gram which had been entered upon, 
until they had some definite guaran
tee for the future. The alumni had 
not furnished the capital fund neces
sary for contingencies and perfecting 
an organization which could be made 
self-supporting in a year or so. There 
was no hope of securing funds for ad
ditional seating capacity in the grand
stand or for even maintaining the 
equipment they already had.
The Athletic Council decided thpre 
were but two things to do. The first 
to put the matter up again to the 
alumni and in addition enlist some 
public support; the second to turn 
the management of athletics back to 
the Administration, where it had been 
(which they felt eventually spelt death 
to athletics of Tech) while they were 
still financially "above -watex* and 
simply admit that the alumni could 
not "put it aver. The former course 
was decided upon hoping that the 
alumni Would AWAKEN to the real 
conditions at Techa School erron
eously supposed even among the Tech 
men to have vast wealth, enough to 
carry out any program;
Unfortunately, this is not the true 
condition and a t committee from the 
Carnegie Corporation in New York 
has just finished an investigation 
which may determine Techs lut-ure. 
Are we to REMAIN in our place 
among the BEST INSTITUTIONS or 
our kind in tho land or to REVERT 
BACK to the SECONDARY CLASS, 
serving only the people of the Pitts
burgh district?
An Athletic Drive was inaugurated 
to extend from February 14 to 28, for 
the sum of $50^000 to carry out the 
program outlined by the Council. The 
students and alumni were organized 
into teams as workers, but the alumni 
as a body have failed to respond to 
the campaign, either in funds or as 
workers on the drive. Some 8,000 
letters were sent to graduates and 
former students, men were approached 
by fraternities, by their own class 
members, by students, still the num.-* 
ber that has responded is only 1,000 
and the greater part of the $35,000, 
which is at hand now, has been se
cured from the outside public.
ARE YOU PROUD OF THESE 
FACTS?
THEN DO YOUR SHARE, BEFORE 
IT IS TOO LATE. Send in your 
pledge at once and bring the existing
 v ? * *2* * * conditions at Tech to the attention of
other Tech men you meet. 
Tfifese facts should bring home most 
forcibly the need of alumni co-opera
tion in the matter of making contri
butions, not only from the financial 
standpoint, but also from the moral 
effect it will have on the students 
and alumni who have worked very 
hard to put this program over. It 
means a thousand times more to have 
five thousand ?10.00 subscriptions than 
fifty $1,000 subscriptions. We want 
to feel that every Tech man is behind 
Tech at this critical period. Those 
who have not responded already 
should mail their check for at least 
$10.00 to Frank H. Haaren, treasurer, 
n order that the efforts of the group, 
who started this forward movement 
for Tech, may continue its work with
out interruption. We are still a long 
distance from the goal which will in
sure our program. Give us the sup
port we ask.
Every alumnus cannot but help feel 
duty bound to back the program de
cided upon, certainly now all eyes, 
especially those of the Carnegie Cor
poration and Investigating Committee, 
are upon us to see if we as alumni 
are interested in Tech's future.
It means EVERYTHING to the 
SCHOOLIT means EVERYTHING 
TO YOU, whether you are a graduate 
of Carnegie Tech, the world-wide 
known INSTITUTION, or Carnegie 
Tech, the PITTSBURGH CITY TECH
NICAL SCHOOL.
WHICH TYPE of institution it is 
to beIS IN YOUR POWER and 
YOURS ALONE to decide.
There is no commercializing of ath
letics, no marked expansion, simply a 
onservative program to increase pub
lic interest in our school and to build 
up our equipment as the publics in
terest demands.
Awaken to the real conditions.
