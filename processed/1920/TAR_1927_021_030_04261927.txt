Of 8th Campus Week

To be Features, Work 
is to Start Now
Modern Decoration for the Modern Coljege! The choice of the General Planning Committee Is as appropriate as It will be colorful. .Completed plan's submltted to the Construction Committee indicate that the campus appearance will rival the colorful absurdities of the Arts Ball.
Tho outstanding characteristic Is an Impression of size. Plans call for tall fountains and tall columns. A bevy of laTge murals In the mod* orn theme, which implies contrast and striking brilliancy, w|ll be hung In the gymnasium and the Union. Decoration will be concentrated In the more strategic spots, rather than an attmepted but incomplete ornamentatton/All the details will be effectively worked out to produce tho most .finished appearance.The street lights will not be ornamented this year., Effect Is the primary object of campus decora* tlon, and' since adornment of the steel poles of our thoroughfare! 'serves but to present a rather maudlin . appearance,, the commit^ tee this year has decided to discontinue .the practice.Other planar for Campus Week are reaching' their final stage of de^sljajmeptiv.Sltea are-.belag'-dl*. enssed for the \Country Fair; Inasmuch' as the ueual lot on Forbes street cannot be used this year. It is expected that nearly' every fraternity will have stunts, this year.- The vaudeville, under the direction of Pete Rygg, lias more avail* ablo material than It can lake care of.

on probation for the rest of Che 
school year. No reason lor the ac
tion of the Council has been made
.In a letter to the members of 
the, stall,' dated April, 20. the moas proposed and carried was 
eta ted-. "Motion carried that the 
Editor-In-Chief of the Puppet' be 
aoved from office,; and that the 
>v  Editor-In-Chief and staff be 
probation for the rest of tlie 
sent school year; that if the 
isod staff and its actions are satisfactory, the staff shall be disbanded.At a meeting of the Staff last Friday, a new editor' was elected;', his name will be announced later, if approved by the dounclL The removal of Bulllnger from Difice comes just at the eve of the Issuing of the well advertised 'Alilmnl'' Number of the Puppet, out today noon on the campus, representing sevoral months work m the part of the deposed editor uid bis staff. Although the Issue, went to press under the old. regime, < it appears-today with the sanction of the cdltor-cloct, who assumes sponsiMUty for its publication.

In the many fraternities houses that I have 
visited I lrnve seen too many instances of a 
false feeling of pre-eminence and too many 
cases of downright depravity to feel that fra
ternities and fraternity houses are other than 
-   ~ an absolute evil that should be extirpated.
Editors Note : A reprint from a reccnt issue little is ever done about the problem because

r having been asked to join a fraternity,
the writer has been an active fraternity 
himself. The writers conclusions may not be 
pertinent tq this campus, but are interesting
sible for the present state of affairs. It is turn
ing out year after year into a world that needs 
help a lot of young popinjays and snobs that 
think the world is their oyster and that man

fogies, but a joke for them.

It 6cems almost time that somothing was 
done about the fraternity business. The fact 
that I am a fraternity man myself makes me 
something of an authority. The additional fact 
that daring the war I was persuaded to fill n 
post that made it necessary to help save from 
foreclosure a great many chapter houses that it 
was thought might be lost as a property invest
ment because a lot of .young men would deserl 
those houses,' makes me a little more familiar 
<with the question and, perhaps, a little more 
'impressed by its dangers.
There is' something almost comic about 'Greek-lcttcr societies. The comedy continues selves by the members is almost unknown 
'beeause they have been, so long established as President Baker of 'Washington and Jefferson 
to have deeply entrenched themselves and to ppints out the general aping of the colleges by

officers of college fraternities or genuinely in
terested in them. Most fraternity men who are 
of any account in the world think of fraterni
ties with a tolerant smile. Those who have 
first-hand information of what goes on in chapwould desert ter houses regret them.
The idea has worked down into high school 
fraternities, which is reducing the whole idea 
still closer to an absurdity, and in these youngcircles the exercise of any restraint of them. -have become a politicalpower that college offi-gjaln and public officials fear to fight too hard,'
