RING DESIGN DECIDED SOON
At a meeting of the Student Council 
on May 15tlr, W. H. Obenour, Chair
man of the Ring Comm'ittee, submit
ted the recommendations of the Com
mittee for the Carnegie Degree Ring. 
The recommendations covered the de
sign, and other matters pertaining to 
the ring, including the material of 
which the ring is to toe made, the 
weights for both men and women, 
and the stone, to be used. The re
port and the recommendations were 
accepted toy the Council.
There is much yet to be done with 
regard to the ring, and many ques
tions have been asked on the campus, 
especially by memtoersi of the present 
Senior class, concerning the plans of 
the committee, and what it expects to 
do. The? following explanation will no 
doubt clear up many questions.

SIMPSON WINS STEWARDSON 
PRIZE
Russell Simpson, graduate of the 
Department of Architecture, was 
awarded the Stewardson prize, at a 
Beaux Arts Judgment, hold last 
week. The prize consists of $1,400, 
which must be used for six months 
of travel in Europe. The subject of 
the competition was the samo as 
that of the last Senior project, "A 
Bank and Office Building.
While all this talk about tradition 
lias been flying so fast, the freshmen 
themselves have been preparing to 
add their share to Carnegies store of 
that which is handed down from year 
to year. i >l! I; )
Being newcomers, the Plebes readi
ly saw that co-operation between th6 
four schools was not what it should 
be. They saw that this was- due to 
the fact that the Freshmen of the 
four schools never got together on any 
occasion and quite naturally would 
conclude that each school was to be 
a world within itself. This is not 
right.
After duly considering these condi
tions, the presidents of the foul

RECORD CROWDS ATTEND OPERAS
An event of great interest and sig
nificance in the Division of the Arts 
was the production on Friday and Sat
urday afternoon and evening of two 
l'ittle operas, composed by J. Vick 
OBrien, head of the School of Music, 
to librettos written byjFrankP. Day, 
Director of the Division of Academic 
Studies. The Schools of Music and 
Drama supplied singers (with one ox'ception), actors, and a large orchestra; 
and Thomas Wood Stevens and Wood
man Thompson mounted the piece 
beautifully.
"The Hour Before Dawn depicts 
the emotions and thoughts of a nurse 
in the last hour of her life before her 
execution at the hands of the enemy. 
To comfort her, come the spirits of 
brave women, and her last moments
The Cosmopolitan 'Club concluded 
this years social activities by a very 
successful pageant and dance held 
in Langley Hall last 'Saturday night. 
The committee in charge had an ex
cellent program of novelty and for
eign dances. Miss R. Schulman 
gave interpretations of Hawaiian and 
Oriental dances. The Czechoslovak 
Folk dance was given toy Miss Kralova and Miss Belehfad. Miss Mary 
 Te Ata ' Thompson pleased with her 
Indian dances. Miss Esther Wolf, a 
little eleven-year-old Pittsburgh girl, 
concluded the specialties with a Rus
sian dance and an Eccentric Jazz 
dance.
DR. BAKER REPRESENTS
CARNEGIE ON C. OF C. TOUR
Dr. Baker represented the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology on the recent 
trade extension tour of the Pittsburgh 
Chamber of Commerce. The party 
spent the week of May 14th visiting 
towns throughout Ohio and West Vir
ginia. Dr. Baker was kept busy 
speaking while on the tour, and many 
of his addresses were before the high 
schools of the towns in which the 
party stopped. He also visited a num
ber of colleges, and became acquaint
ed with the administratives and the 
organizations of these institutions.
"In almost every town, said Dr. 
Baker, among the first to meet us 
was the Superintendent of Schools, 
or some other educational officer, who 
conducted us at once to the schools 
of the community. It was made quite 
evident that one of the very first con 
cerns of these people was for their 
schools and school facilities. And 
they listened with interest to news of 
educational work elsewhere.
SheShall we hug and kiss and 
tell jokes?
HeLets not jest now.
We are assured on very good auth
ority that even Homer sometimes 
nods. 'Some one was surely deep in 
slumber when "When'the Devil was 
111 was selected and prepared for 
production. This dramatic opus of 
Mr. James McEvoys lias all the 
freshness and vivacity of tank vaude
ville or the perennial Charleys Aunt. 
Technically it is so ancient that one 
expected the 'soutorette and the game
keeper to dance a. Weak-down, or the 
Welshman to favor with a comic mon
olog between the acts. Seriously, 
however, the piece is fatally obvious 
in conception and design, and its 
boasted satirical passages have the 
brilliance of smart undergraduate 
writing. Whatever value th play 
may have as an exercise in acting, it 
might be well to safeguard the aud
ience by a program-note: "This is a
bad play; laugh at it, not with it. 
There remains for the actors to 
squeeze what sustenance is possible 
from this particularly withered or
ange. They, are persuaded, accord
ingly, to squeeze with all their might 
and main. The conspicuous method is 
exaggeration, and most of the partici
pants are perfect in it. Mr. Paquin, 
once he gets his stride, furnishes per
haps the most legitimate amusement. 
His Martin Leatherhead is the re
spectable, timorous, city-bred "tender
foot, inevitably distressed by the 
absent amenties of life in a van. Mr. 
Reids young novelist in gypsy guise 
is calculated to palp the chocolate-nib-j 
tolers, and to Miss Bassingers clarity 
of vision Isopels tomfoolery was evi
dently credible to no one else, least 
of all, herself. With the rest, Miss 
Floyd, is tempted to caricature where 
it might have been possible to charac
terize. Mr. Hertz linguistic ieats are 
fascinatingly international. The to
tal effect was not one to treasure 
alongside the verve and the shrewd 
satire of Arms and the Man.

dreams over the story of the pair who 
met, loved, and parted there, and, lilt 
by a. stray shell, dies among the 
flowers.' Both librettos are lyric rath
er1 than dramatic in'structure, and 
their highest excellence is their lyrical 
writing. In the first .it might have 
been possible to dramatize the con
flict In spirit and ideals between tive 
'nurse and her captors, and not to 
give the spirits voice is surely Ineffec
tive and uneconomic. Moreover, it Is 
difficult, to reconcile-oneself to the 
spoken passages; the adapting 
tlie^e passages to singable music 
would heighten the value of these 
works greatly.
To this particular untutored listen
er, Mr. OBriens score for the Hour 
is richer and more ambitious though 
less varied than his setting of the 
Roses. In both cases, the melodic in
vention is tireless, and the orchestra
tion of skill, ingenuity, and powers 
which are compelling. Mr, OBrien's 
music is so intrinsically valuable that 
much of it could stand without the 
extraneous features of a show. He de
serves thanks, not only as a composer, 
but as director, since it was his task 
to govern and unify the diverse ele
ments of a totality of effoct.
The singing and acting parts were 
taken adequately and effectively. Mrs. 
Rosa K. Hamilton, who sang the cap
tive, has a rich contralto which kept 
its values to the end of her exhaust
ing part. Miss Fraley's' pleasing so
prano is hardly equal to-the strain of 
such sustained effort; in this respect 
Miss Bartletti came off better though 
her voice is thinner and perhaps less 
(Continued on Page Four)
and to alter, and ralter them, and to solve the many 
problems connected with the ; selec
tion of a suitable design, the com
mittee found it impossible to push the 
work faster than it has been done. 
Practically all of the work yet to be 
done hinges about the design, and for 
that reason it was impractical to pro
ceed until the design had been passed 
upon by at least the committee and 
the Student Council. In view of the 
short time between the adoption or 
the design by the Council and grad
uation, and the many things yet to be 
done, it will be impossible to secure 
the rings, for the present Senior class 
before commencement. Not less than 
thirty days are required to cut the 
dies and manufacture the rings after 
the order has been placed and a pat
tern submitted for approval. It will 
be some time yet before that stage 
can be reached.
The present plan provides that the 
committee as it now stands -push the 
work as fav as possible before Com
mencement. At that time, or probably 
before, new members will be appoint
ed from the Junior classes to fill the 
vacancies made by the graduation of 
the representatives of the present 
Senior classes, and the work will be 
taken up by the reorganized commit
tee where it then stands. As soon as 
the proper bodies have passed upon 
the design, and 'its standardization 
has been assured, then the present 
Senior class and the alumni will be 
solicited and an order placed. The 
very nature of the work, and the 
thoroughness with winch the commit
tee wishes to do it makes time, and 
lots of it, an essential element.
SECOND YEAR CLASS
OF 21 ORGANIZE
At a meeting of all second-year men 
Wednesday, May 18, the following 
officers were elected:
PresidentW. A. McCutcheon.
Vice PresidentF. C. Ankeney.
SecretaryW. W. Weaver.
Treasurer-^P. J. Patterson.
The purpose of the organization is 
to have the second-year men repre
sented during Commencement Week, 
and also to get the first-year class or
ganized. The second-year class has 
experienced many difficulties during 
the present school year through the 
lack of some form of organization to 
represent them. It is hoped that 
through organization of the first-year 
class, these difficulties may be over
come next year.
ELECTRICALS' WORK GOOD
The aid of the beautiful electrical 
display in helping to make Campus 
Week the success it was has been 
recognized by the entire student 
body and the visiting alumni. More 
important than this it demonstrated 
to thousands of Pittsburghers the 
fact that Carnegie Tech possessed 
immeasurable potential possibilities, 
All of the credit for this is due to 
Charles Fleishman, chairman of the 
electrical committee and the many 
willing workers from the electrical 
departments of the Divisions of En
gineering and of the Industries. The 
equipment was loaned by the plants 
of the United States Steel Corpora 
tion in this district as the result of 
the efforts of several senior elec
tricals. The constant co-operation of 
the school authorities-made the work 
much easier.
A great amount of hard work, sacrifice of the enjoyment of the other 
Campus Week events,' but crowning 
it all the realization that they had by 
their efforts put something acrossl 
which cannot help but make for a 
better Tech.

Skibos Pile-Up Score of 14-6 
Saturday on Tech Field
It was a comedy of errors, in 
which Tech triumphed 14 to 6, last 
Saturday over the Washington and 
Jefferson baseball nine.
The game started off with a rush, 
Tech scoring three runs in the first 
inning. The Washingtonians seomod 
unable to hold the sphere and a con 
tinual series of errors made things 
easy for the Tech nine. Windy1 
Lynn's infield hit resultod in a home 
run, it getting through three Red 
and Black fielders, who handled the 
ball as though It were red hot.
There seemed to be some doubt as 
to tho umpires knowledge of the 
game, the Washington supporters 
wielding their rule books, on close 
decisions, like lawyers at a divorce 
case.
Al Irwin, Tochs bacitstop, had tho 
unique experience of facing his 
brother on the opposing Loam, the 
oilier Irwin, pitching for,W. <& .1. i
The star performers for Tech, 
were Warrick, Joe and Ray'Doherty' 
and Lynn. McLaughlin, first sacker 
for Washington and tho two pitch
ers, displayed good form, but lack 
of support resultod in their downfall.

With the election of officers for the 
coming year aud the assumption of 
control by these new, officials, Indus
tries Assembly ended a very success
ful year at its final session last Wed
nesday. The names of the nominees 
for the various olllces, which bad been 
posted the week previous, were again 
'introduced by President Hammann 
and the assembly proceeded immed
iately to ballot for its new leaders.
During the balloting, President 
Hammann made a short farewell ad
dress In which he thanked the assem
bly for the splendid support they had 
given him during the year. He spoke 
of the many cases 'in which the Div
ision of Industries had lead tho rest 
of the school in carrying out activities, 
and while he disparagod the growth 
of hide-bound sectionalism 'in the var
ious departments, ho urged, that the 
members of the assembly maintain 
their individuality by working as a 
unit to support all the activities of tho 
school. He closed Ills remarks with 
an exhortation that tho members of 
the assembly support tho neSv officers 
as loyally as they had supported tho 
passing adminstration.

1921 COMMENCEMENT BALL
The 1921 Commencement Ball will 
be held in the Arts School Foyer on

This will be the last chance for the 
Seniors, Juniors and Alumni to got

THE SENIOR BANQUET
You will never forget the (Senior 
Banquet of the class of 1921. Of 
course every class says ,that about 
their banquet but then every class 
doesnt have E. A. Butts as chairman 
and seldom has a class such a connoiseur as Louis Pitts to assist and 
advise on all those most essential de
tails that make feed a banquet.
These few opening words telL more 
to the class of twenty-one and those 
so fortunate as to be their friends 
than many paragraphs that might be 
written either before and I was about 
to say afte'r the great banquet that is 
to take place on the evening of Wed
nesday, June .1, at the Lincoln Club 
on Craft avenue, at 6 p. m. All Senior 
men are Invited and no one 1s going 
to miss this final feed, before gradua
tion if he can possibly pawn liis wrist 
watch.

After Tech had taken most of tho 
places. In tho track events, Navy 
came back strong In the field events 
and won 71 to 41 & in a dual track 
and field meet at Annapolis last 
Saturday. The Tartans started off 
strong in the meet, , Kelly, Tallmon 
and Lockwood taking all three places 
In the 10 yard dash. This trio re
peated in the 220 in the same order , 
and Navy saw hopes of winning tho 
meet go glimmering. The sailors 
started their point getting by win
ning the mile relay. Hiller came in 
first in the 440' and Stultz took 
away the honors In the pole vault. 
These were the only other two first 
places which Tech gathered, making 
their total four. Navy by taking 
first in all the field events, but the 
pole vault, secured nine firsts, which 
were enough to guarantee them the 
victory.
Tech led through the first two 
sections of the mile relay but Curtis, 
Navys best. distance man, cut down 
the lead sufficient to enable the Bail
ors to come In first. Curtis also 
copped first place in the mile run, 
followed by Miller and Dykeman o. 
Tech.
On Saturday the track team will 
run in the intercollegiate meet at 
Washington.
Most of the colleges of Western 
Pennsylvania are entered, including 
Pitt and It will be a great; thing for 
Tech If the track, team comes off 
victor.

COMMENCEMENT WEEK
Commencement Weok is here again and another class of Carnegie Tech 
is about to go forth into the world to represent their Alma Mater in many 
fields of endeavor, but before they leave our campus they are planning one 
glorious week of celebrations which at least to them is one of the biggest 
things that ever happened at Tech. It is strange that no one ever realizes 
the greatness of this celebration quite as much as the Senior. The Plehe 
has just come to his own and is planning what ho is going to do as a 
Sophomore, the Sophomore juBt realizes he is about to become an upper 
classman and is looking forward to his first Junior Prom, while the mighty 
Junior realizes that it is he who carries all the responsibility and can now 
strut the campus with all the dignity of an all-important Senior. This leaves 
only the poor and insignificant Senior who has now been sufficiently humili
ated by having been offered a position as ollice boy in the firm in which he 
expected to be at least a second assistant manager to celebrate the allportant event of his graduation.
To look at the Commencement Week program of the present graduating 
class it would seem that they are planning to leave Tech with a good taste 
in their mouths or at least it should be by Monday, June sixth, as the Senior 
banquet will have been over live days by the time they are able to board 
trains .and street cars to their respective homes with the little old diploma 
safely tucked under one arm.
However, with all joking aside, the program looks like a good one and 
the committee in charge, of which C. IT. Wallace is chairman, deserves a lot 
of credit for the hard work they have been putting in. For a celebration of 
this nature it is hardly necessary to ask for the support of the rest of the 
student body to make the thing a success as this should be spontaneous. Be
sides, we have the precedent set by Campus Week that must be lived up to 
let the motto of Carnegie Tech be "What wo do, we do well. To this I 
would personally like to add: Next year do less, but do it better. It is the 
opinion of many people about the campus that Commencement Week and 
Campus Week should be made one grand event next year. Try it.

A NEW TRADITION FOR CARNEGIE TECH
The Mardi Gras should be an annual event and one of the most import
ant of Campus Week. The enthusiasm shown by students and alumni alike 
shows that it has filled a need In the schedule of social events upon the 
Campus. Those most interested in it were doubtful even to the last minute 
that the affair would be a success. Many alumni came just to see what it 
would bo like, but ovory one said before leaving: You may be sure Ill be 
back next year in costume. This all goes to prove that when Tech stu
dents start something and got behind to push, nothing in the world can stop 
them.
LANGUEY LABORATORY FOR OUR BIG SOCIAL EVENTS
Did you hear any one saying at the Mardi Gras or the Alumni Banquet, 
"The party Is all right but what a shod they are holding it in! Instead, 
from overy side, "I never know that the Lab. looked like this. With just 
a few simple decorations a truly beautiful setting resulted which would have 
done credit to any dance., More of pur big affairs should bo hold on the 
campus and tho money saved used in making tho party better or kept in 
the pockets of tho students, Classes, organizations and individuals alike 
should realize that in order to have a successful dance or othor social event 
tho tapostrlos on tho wall are secondary to real Tech "pep.

It has been the observation of those in charge of tho dormitories that 
too many Freshmen fall every year not because they wore not the right 
sort, or from lack of capacity, but largely because of living conditions. They 
are scattered over a wide area, and frequently can find rooms only in unat
tractive lodging houses. The ties that bind tho class are too loose, and points 
of common contact too few. Tho more Freshmen can live and work together 
during their first year in residence, the greater should be the opportunity lor 
the proper growth of class and Tech spirit.

careless, nonchalant manner not at^^her words, our system of manhandlall analogous with their inner selves.
They become so accustomed to the, 
artificiality that their time personali
ties become submerged by superficial 
affoctatlons. And it is a rare occa
sion when the false mantle is laid 
aside long-enough for ono to become 
aware of tho depth of his fellow, studont, unless he Is an intimate friend.
It Is often remarked that the ma
jor!! y of campus women affect a friv
olous manner because they think the 
men expoct it and that when by them
selves they are wholly different,' And 
how far the campus man Is who will 
ask a co-ed to uphold the other half 
of a serious conversation! Its not the 
expected thing, and its not being 
dono. Tho women apparently think 
the men want merely to be enter!allied, to bo fed up on gossip and to 
be told of how diligently they avoid 
anything that would require serious 
thought. And with similar motives 
the men tell the women how they suc
ceed in accomplishing something by 
doing comparatively nothing, or (they 
are not immune) the latest gossip.
The motive is to get by. Analyze 
any ordinary five-minute conversation 
and be convinced.
The cultivation of such shallowness 
must eventually lead to permanent in
ability to think serious thoughts or 
do serious things. White lies may 
be evils necessitated by complex so

insincerity thought" to be necessary

thing to an extreme. Its time some 
of us were dropping our false fronts.

BONDAGE OR PARTNERSHIP
There seems to be a growing senti
ment in regard to the abolition of 
plebe regulations which is going to 
make necessary in a short time 
definite decision either for a strong 
re-establishment of existing regula
tions or a complete revolution or 
regulations.
To consider the issue as between 
imposing regulations on freshmen and 
granting license to freshmen is hard
ly correct. It is rather a choice Be
tween regulation by law and force 
and regulation by sentiment. In ordi
nary life laws and systems for en
forcing laws must bo created because 
of tho complexity growing out of the 
eternal strifo between many opposing 
factions* But among college men it 
is possible to rule all activities by 
sentiment. That is our belief and 
the experience of other institutions 
and colleges prove it true. For in 
college there is> a unity of purpose 
and a simplicity of life which make 
for ideal conditions. If we could but 
arouse ourselves, to a realization of 
those duties and, then set about per
forming them we would come into a 
much richer life. Now our decision
ing freshmen 'is barbarous and obso
lete. To force a freshman into sub
mission is to break his spirit, de
crease his self-respect, and destroy 
any poise ho may have. Thereby his 
usefulness in later college life may he 
destroyed and certainly his first im
pression is most unpleasant. Thank 
Heavens! those who stick it out find 
that things are not what they seem; 
for truly our life here is democratic 
and everyone is most tolerant and 
considerate. We need but treat our 
freshmen more humanely and we 
have advanced far toward a better 
life.
There will always be freshmen who 
are dead, sure of themselves and their 
abilities. The proper treatment for 
them Is not the barbers clippers but 
a complete ostracism. Let them be 
ignored' by every person on the 
campus, even by the school in which 
they are registered and the fraternity 
to which they are pledged, until such 
a time when they are willing to come 
back to earth and assume their right
ful place on the campus'.
Our old system of regulations has 
not been altogether successful but 
worst of all it is an obsolete system. 
There ai*e those who will say that the 
plebe cap is a wonderful beginning of 
tradition. But what a more wonder
ful tradition it would be if every fall 
the freshman were met by a commit
tee of upper classmen who would help 
him to find himself and his place in 
his new surroundings, discover his 
talents, interest him in campus activi
ties, and encourage him in his work.
Such a reformation will take time 
but surely it is coming. The upper 
classmen are taking the broader view. 
Men and organizations who have the 
campus welfare at heart . ought to 
make public their opinions. When the 
time is ripe the Student Council will 
no doubt take the matter in hand and 
call for a general vote. Such a com
mittee as mentioned above would act 
under the direction of the Student 
Council and would consist of repre
sentatives from all the organizations 
on the campus. Its duty would be 
to help the freshman arrange himself 
so that he would soon feel at home 
and a part of the campus life. May 
we soon realize this bigger duty to 
the freshman. Let us take him unto 
ourselves and do all we can to make 
him a good citizen of the campus.

WEDNESDAY, MAY 25, 1921THE TARTANPAGE YHREEPLAID ATHLETICS
CARNEGIE TAKES 
HARO FOUGHT MATCH
The Carnegie Tech tennis team bat
tled its way to the sectional cham
pionship last Wednesday when they 
handed the West Virginia University 
tennis representatives a set-hack to 
the tune of five matches to one for 
West Virginai. In turning this trek, 
the tennis players had to put forth 
their best effort of the year, and to 
say that they deserved to win the 
victory would be putting it mildly; 
they more than merely deserved 
'twould. have been a mistake some
where if they had not won. And on 
the other side of the matter, that is 
to say, from the viewpoint of West 
Virginia, it was certainly a hard tour
ney to lose, for each and every one 
of their men put up a fight from the 
very beginning to the very end.
West Virginia started off by win
ning the first match, when Hammond, 
their number 1 man, defeated Keil, 7- 
5, 2-6, 6-3. The match was closely 
contested throughout; never at any 
time could the winner have been pick
ed until the final point had been call
ed, and then there was some doubt 
as to whether Keil had really been 
beaten, even though he lost according 
to official scores. Hammonds game 
is such that he will practically always 
be returned the. winner. He is not a 
pretty player, but is uncanny acurate, 
relying on a lobbing game throughout, 
and occasionally letting loose a ter
rific drive, when closely pressed. 
Time and time again, lie would rush 
over to one side of the court, and by 
a low, sweeping swing, would send 
across the net a screeching drive for 
an ace. To oppose this type of game, 
Keil endeavored to play the net, but 
here was rebuffed by lobs. But, at 
times he would gain the upper hand 
t the net, and would in such times, 
cleverly volley from one side of the 
court to another, and finally execute 
a nice kill; Keil did not show enough 
aggression, which in some instances 
accounted for his defeat, but then 
again, it must be admitted that it is 
mighty hard to show aggression 
against the type of game as played 
by Hammond.
In the second set, Schwartz, playing 
number 2, took over Coffman with 
ease. Scores, 6-2, 6-0. The form
shown by Schwartz was a complete 
reversal of form as shown by him 
against Washington & Jefferson. His 
overhead game was going great, as 
also was his drive, and serve.
In the third set Neville defeated 
Cutright, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. This set was 
the first set lost by Neville this sea
son. Cutright played the same type 
of game as Neville, and for that rea
son was very interesting from the gal
lery viewpoint. Both men took 
chances that would ordinarily -not be 
taken by "the best of tennis players, 
but this rather than making the 
match uninteresting, made it more in
teresting. Both men drove through
out, and the winner won because he 
played the better driving game of ten
nis.
In the final singles match, Schmertz 
won from McIntosh by the score of 
6-3, 6-1. Schmertz is improving his. 
game day by day, and it would not 
be surprising to see him playing num
ber 1 some of these days before the
DUQUE3NE UNIVERSITY 
DEFEATED 7-5
Coming from benind, and scoring 
five runs in one inning, the Carne
gie nine last Tuesday defeated the 
Duquesne1 University team in their 
second meeting this year by the 
score of 7 to 5.
In the fifth inning It looked as 
though the Tartan squad was in for 
a defect, but led by Cappe the 
Skibos ran the score up to 6.
Cappe and Joe Doherty were the 
stars of the day for Tech. Cappe 
bit a technical two-bagger, which 
turned out to be a home run, when 
the fielder let the ball get away from 
him. Doherty made three hits and 
scored a run. Godden did fine work 
in fielding, playing in short stop. 
McCaw pitched a good finish to the 
game, only 13 men to bat in four in
nings.

THE SCORE?
The spectators at the baseball games played on the Tech field are wont 
to look at the score board during the course of the games, and find there 
nothing but a blank board. It would seem that at least one field assistant 
might keep the watchers in touch with the game score as it develops.
Then too, would it not be a good idea to construct a score board upon 
which, at least the score by innings could be noted? A little thought and 
effort on some one's part who may be interested, may convince one of the 
Pittsburgh newspapers that a score board would be appreciated.
LUSBY, THE SOUTH PAW
Among the left-handed pitchers on the Tech squad is a player of real 
promise, known to all as Joe. Lusby has pitched for Tech, on and oil 
and each time has managed to give a good account of himself.
In the Varsity-Alumni game during Campus Week he pitched a threeliit game and had eight strikeouts to his credit. This is a fine record and 
few may boast of it. Guess wed better watch Joe Lusby next year.
FOOTBALL
The school year drawing to a close, some thought must be given to 
the 1921-22 football team, which is to represent Tech on the gridiron next 
fall. It has not, as yet, been definitely decided where the football training 
camp is to be located, but is only a matter of a few days Avhen such infor
mation will be available.
Likely candidates will be given consideration and a chance to try out; 
further information about the camp to be given in a later issue, but it is 
well for those interested to be giving this matter some thought.___________
CARNEGIE COPS 8-2 
ST. BONAVENTRE GAME
The Carnegie nine proved too 
much for the Saint Bpnaventure 
team last Thursday, trimming them 
to the tune of S to 2.
, The Skibos took the lead at the 
beginning and kept at it with a 
steady bombardment of hits totalling 
ten. The Plaid baseballers took the 
situation out of the hands of the 
Bonaventure pitcher in the eighth, 
scoring four of their runs this 
period.
Red Godden in center field showed 
lie could place himself un
der the high ones. Skinny McCaw 
displayed his usual trick of running 
the fielders up the hill for his hits. 
Lynn played a good game at short 
stop.

ADDRESSED TO DILL1
Dear Bill,
Many readers may think I am look
ing a little too far into tho future but 
it seems to me that the football sea
son is not so far off but what we 
could be'thinking about the trip to 
Penn State next fall.
If you will stop to consider last 
years football record you will find 
that the team won all the homo games 
and lost all those played on foreign 
fields. What does thiB mean? Well 
it means that away from home the 
team didn't have the support that it 
had at the home games. The Tech 
spirit and Tech crowd was not there 
to lend a hand in the way of cheer
ing and what can a team in any line 
of sport do without the support of the 
student body? The fight that the 
team put into the last game last year 
was partly due to the fact that every
one in the stands cheered the team 
so that they put all they had into 
the contest.
There is no question but what ev
eryone will accompany the team to 
Little Washington next fall, but what 
about the Penn State game? My sug
gestion is that everyone open a sav
ings account, deposit a dollar or two 
each month from now on and save 
the necessary $13.32 for the round 
trip to State College on a Tech 
Special.
Would like to know what others 
have to say about a Carnegio TechPenn State savings account.
Yours for a State victory next 
season.
A Tech Rooter.
DETROIT OUT PLAYS
CARNEGIE 8-2
Detroit University proved too much 
for the Tartan baseball team last 
Wednesday aftornoon, defeating 
Iians Wagner's proteges by tho deci
sive score of 8 to 2.
Tho individual star of the game 
was the Detroit  pitcher, Ivudroh, 
who kept the Carnegio batampu 
guessing during the whole game, ho 
allowing only four hits. The Plaid 
squad did not seem to be able to hit 
beyond tho infield. Detroit made a 
total of ten hits off Warrick, whoso 
delivery did not seem impossible for 
the Ford City boys to gauge.
McCaw was the only Carnegie 
man able to hit one out, placing it 
in right field.
'For the visitors, Maille was a big 
point gotter, making two hits and 
scoring three runs.
The feature of the game was tho 
sensational catch made by Durkin of 
the Skibo nine, in the sixth inning, 
when he made a running catch which 
would have been a probable homo 
run, and threw a fast one to first, 
where a double play resulted.
West Virginia University is to be 
congratulated upon receiving an ap
propriation of $3,000,000 from the 
State recently.

SOME ALUMNI WHO WERE
BACK FOR CAMPUS WEEK
To those alumni who were not 
back at Tech for Campus Week I 
must say missed the greatest Tech 
affair ever held. This is the ver
dict handed down by all the alumni 
who were here.
.From the beginning of the parade 
on Thursday until the last act o; 
the circus on Saturday, it was . sure 
a howling success.
The outstanding feature of the cele
bration was the Mardi Gras and the 
good old spirit was prevalent every
where.
With us during the three days 
was "Billy Sands, a former student 
of Tech and a graduate of Univer
sity of Virginia, 1916, in law, now 
practising in Norfolk, Va. Billy 
will long be remembered by the un
dergraduates as the big man with 
the big smile.
G. M. Sperry, Industries, 15, now 
with the Metropolitan Edison Com
pany, Reading, Pa.: A great time
was enjoyed by all, says S. M.
Edward E. Duff, Jr., Science, '13, 
with the Eastern Paving Brick Man
ufacturing Association, Pittsburgh. 
Ed did not have far to come but he 
was right on the job.
L.. E. Exline, Science, 09, with the 
Fidelity & Deposit -Company of 
Maryland, Philadelphia, Pa. L. E. 
is President of the Philly Clan and 
got some very clever ideas from the 
Mardi Gras.
L. M. Merrill, Science, 17, now 
with the American Gas Accumulator 
Company, Elizabeth N. J. Red 
was all here in soul and heart. He 
displayed the same old spirit when 
he' led cheers at the alumni banquet.
Henry Shaub, a former student, 
now an architect in Lancaster, ,Pa. 
Henry dropped his duties for a few 
clays and made his home with us.
Harry A. Woellmer, Industries, 15, 
with New York Telephone Company, 
Poplar Ridge, N. Y. Harry did not 
care to talk with us over the phone 
so instead made us a visit.
'F. L. Koethen, Science, OS,. with 
Aclieson Graphite Company, Niagara 
Falls, N. Y. F. L. although grad
uated years' ago, was here.
Ritchie Lawrie, Jr., Science, 11, 
with Lawrie & Lapley, architects, 
Harrisburg, Pa. "R. L. couldnt re
sist talking over old time so he 
made it his business to be here.
Many more alumni were with us 
and we know that; next May the 
campus will be1 dotted with them! 
Begin planning now for next year 
arnl come and enjoy the real spirit 
with the rest of us.
The greatest Tech event of the 
year.

ALL SCHOOLS PLEBE DANCE 
FRIDAY NIGHT
(Continued From Page One.)
freshman classes together with their 
committees, determined the feeling of 
their classmates in the matter and 
eventually arranged to have a dance 
for all freshmen at Tech in the Arts 
School foyer on Friday, May 28th, at 
8:30. This w^ill be a big affair and 
the different committees are prepar
ing to make it as memorable an occa
sion as the Mardi Gras.
The program has been exceptionally 
well designed and will be very highly 
prized. There are going to be favors 
which will be worth the price of ad
mission alone. And in addition the 
entertainment committee has prom
ised something else free besides the 
extra fine intermission fillers.
The Maggie Murphs are going to 
show \Vhiat they can do when it comes 
to refreshments and the decorations 
will, be well directed by Arts fresh
men.
Special music of eight pieces is be
ing Secured by Ev. Hughes and A1 
School. It Is going to be something 
new on the campus and is sure to 
create more talk than the Jazz band.
The chairmen at the heads of the 
comm'ittees from the respective 
schools are: Miss 'Colwell, M. M.;
R. Larew, Science, E. Grass, Arts.
The matter of having the occasion 
an annual affair Was brought before 
the Board of Student Activities and 
they decided to make the Freshman 
Frolic an annual affair coming in De
cember.
THE OPERAS, MAY 20-21, 1921
(Continued From Page One.)
sweet. Mr. Gros sang Pierre very 
agreeably, though some of his low 
tones were done to death by the vig
orous orchestra. Especial commenda
tion belongs to Mr. Willard for his 
reading tastefully and impressively 
the long role of the officer in the face 
of a competing orchestra.
The production elements qu'ite putto shame the tasteless effects of the 
professional companies which deign 
to stop in this city. The prison scene 
is admirably designed to suggest 
height and distance, and the alternat
ing visions of intact and ruined Mercatel are ingenious and beautiful. 1 In 
both cases the lighting is adroitly il
lusive.
The kind old gentleman met his 
friend, little Willie/one very hot day.
Hello, Willie, lie exclaimed. And 
how is your, dear old grandpa stand
ing the heat? . '
Aint heard yet, said William. 
Hes only been dead a week.Tar
