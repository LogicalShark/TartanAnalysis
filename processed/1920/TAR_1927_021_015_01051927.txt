. States' would bo none to good io* -tbe exacting persons "who will at*.- tend tbe Junior Prom, but It eeema to be ani, assured fact that even these will', be enthralled by tbe melodious muelngs of Dave Harmon's'boys.
This . 12-plece orcheatra, which will play at the Grand ilurlbg January, baa been very prominent. lor several. years. During this past year they bave played for Oblo State, University of Pennslvani* and Coniell Prom6. : Harmans 1N a.

There will L many who .will be glad to hear, for Various reasons, that the Hotel Schenley will be the scene of this ball supreme. The committee in charge baB chosen the Schenley,' because, in addition to %eing near the. campus. It is equally suitable for ' the' occasion. The Carnegie ^atmosphere" le al- ways^present at_ thevSc^nley.
e g ' particularly ' - delightful little bit or leather, or perhaps It is of silver, has been-cbosen as tbe favor for the Junior Prom. Every member, on the committee has been known to rave for hours at the mere -mention of tbe word favor. It is quite evident, that, out of a brainstorm, hallucination, or mental gymnastic of some kind; someone evolved this Idea foT a favor; But though they all talk willingly and.'enthneiistlcally,'. they are reticent1 to,-tlv6-xtr*ine^Jciian,_il

The supper thla year according to the committee, will .not bei huge enough to satisfy a rapacious appetite,, but promises lo be of the highest quality. Thus It will be seen that the Junior Prm of 1927 will Indeed live up to the glorious fame of Its predecessors. Last years ball will ring' through the ages in tbe memories of those who attended. Omens present and .the spirit evidenced this year' roakei it a very evident fact that the class of 28 . will hold, a i+bm that even surpasses last years..Tbe personnel of tbe general committee, and that ot th subcommittee, is. such that , success is the only possible restL At 'present tho busiest member Is: Mark Seibert in charge of ticket sales.A final work or xtwo.

of the' Southern California .Clan, 
Mr. G. R_ Brandln: '
You-can easily, imagine that 
Carnegie beating Notre. Dame 
caused a lot of excitement and talk 
here in Southern 'California. Notre 
Dame played U. S. C. here in Los Angeles last Saturday, Just a week after we had beaten them. I think 
that all of the U. S: C. and Stanford fao&twere rather put out at 
oar beating the Irish, as it. stole some ot their smoke. Even If U. S.' C. had1 won lost Saturday it wouldn't have amounted to so much since Notre Damo was already beaten.
"Surely the game called foi celebration and the Southern California Clan pot It on last Friday night, December 3rd. We'bad another reason for putting on this party, which in fact, was the original idea, bat - the Notre Dame game came at just the opportune, time to make It a double celebration.
"Mary RlcaTd. A'20, who Is ope or our alumni, is taking one of the leading parts In "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes at tbeBelasco theater. She takes tbe part of. "Dorothy body agrees that she is the bit of the show.
Thirty-four members of the Southern California Clan wont to the theater last Friday night. We bad a large sign displayed in front the theater stating that this was Carnegie night. We bung a large Carnegie Banner in tbe lobby and or lilies of tbe valley tied with Tartu ribbons. .,
After the show we west to Millers Lafayette ror supper and dance. It ^as college-night .at tbe care and there were rooters from U. S. C., Stanford. Notre Dame. Michigan and many other schools, but of course, we outnumbered and out-cheered all ot them.
"Jack Meredith started It off by playing Dear Old Tech on the 
piano while the rest of us did our best to sing.
"A little later In the evening' a dancing contest was held and Col
onel Fred Foster, who. by the way, was tho first captain of a Carnegie football team, and announced as Buch, judged the contest. Mary Rlcard* and Bob Finkelhor stayed In tbe contest to the end and were second best. It would have been the crowning triumph for ust if we had been able to take away, the silver Dancing trophy.

CARNEGIE GIRLS 
WIN RIFLE OPENER
During the week ending Decem
ber 11, 1926, Cfnegle, Toch Wom
en's Rifle Team .fired'its first col
legiate match. It was against

Lloyd Yoder, captain of Carne
gies great, football team and Allerlcan taclUe, is to ' recolve 
re honore to add to his already 
latge collection:' He will be honor 
at a luncheon given by the 
Pittsburgh Carnegie Clan at the 
Fjjr'l PHt Hotel ion .Saturday, Janu
ary.15, and 1N to be the subject of 
tablet to be erected in the varsity 
clan room in the gymsasiugi.
The reason for all ot this Is that 
Yoder is the first Carnegie football 
player to- have been selected by 
guiztl critics as a member of 
the mythical All-American eleven. 
By 'h'is great playing for the past 
..years, and particularly dur
ing the. past season, he has brought 
honor to his school, to himseir, and 
 the game.
Unquestionably. national recoglition of Bulls merit was brought 
about by the downfall of Notre 
 at the hands of his team. 
Had It not been for this, be would bave beea indeed'fortunate to rate honorable mention, but when critics sought for reasons for the ifeat of the Fighting Irish, they first used all of the old alibis and a few new ones, only to-find that none of them could explain that 19- polnt margin of superiority. And finally they awoke to the fact that Carnegie had a really great team. Coach Steffen came in for his 
share of tbe credit. and now it's
There .is no doubt but that Lloyd is the moBt noted player Carnegie ias yet bad. His prominence Is an 
insurance that Carnegie has "ar- lved in the world of football, and ihould henceforth secure the place in the national Speight which' It has long deserved; '

Drama Department Takes Passing of the Third
Floor Back to Inmates of Western Penitentiary
Itwns an eventful day-'for .the 
Inmates of the Western State 
Penitentiary when the Drama Department presented The Passing of The Third Floor Back" by Jerome K. Jerome for their, entertainment. The prisoners very rarely see productions from the. outside world, and .some of them professed that they had never seen a'play; eo that it was very Interesting to watch their emotional reaction to a realistic drama.
The play that was presented, le to be regarded more as a parable than a play; haTanguini appear to inculcate individuals to emulate those in the hierarchy.' The Spirit of Christ, incarnated In the Stranger, serves to ameliorate and edify In a-manner that Is entirely beautiful. , \ :
Had the audience ' of prisoners felt that they were being sermon- Ized they would have immediately resented it fcy evincing their disgust The criminals seem to be endowed with a herd outer shell that Is immune to sanctimony, and it is only when this shell Is .pierced that the true religiosity at the core- ot the criminal is found. ' The play jailed lo penetrate this shell and so It remained merely an after noon's entertainment that was punctuated by systaltic laughter.The lines of the play, which had previously' seemed 'quite' simple were immediately distorted by ifr prisoners to have a comic mean ing. The subtleties of the drama escaped their attention, but thrfin: significant lloeB  those - which would be expected to appeaae the palate of puerility, were immensely appreciated by the audience:' The afternoon performance came as. a supreme relief to the Incarcerated- men; tbeir emotions like th transitory andr.fleetlng May-fly: lived buoyantly .for :a few.ihours .while they. werewitnesBingapag th book of life;The  Jezebel type of woi
the play seemed'to find favor with the audience vjrhile the supercUl- i and haughty heroine .obviouscommotlon. and. wh^nwthe "Thief* and Whisky we tered, a rousing cheer nearly resulted. The prisoners gave with their hands .when theihero and heroine Uased each other.-bd hey laughed , heartily when vthe characters wept." Although'the jrtsoaen are very humai the re/
for them taking this intlthett- view of appreciation' may lie In the fact that life has dealt with ,em moat unkindly.
When the painted lady uttered ie line, It's a funny world ?ith lot of ;funny people-In it, the reaction that swept over the men ed to be one'of mutual agree- And when the Stranger confessed That he lived so out of the world, this stray sentiment probably cut verydeeply -withthose who will nevi>f. the i The Western standing on the appears . like

The mass of individuals that sat in the dimmed chapel, where the play was given, had all suffered the cruel benediction of Justice;, theirs had been the ordeel of the courts; they had passed through trials and had been judged on the aberration ot a moment As thev sat-there with their pale etiolated, faces, each Intent on tbat glimpse of the outside world which was be ing presented on the stage, there till- lived behind .- those concentrated , countenances, sanguinary and rapacious characters.
