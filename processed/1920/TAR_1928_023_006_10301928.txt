Carnegie Makes Onlj' Score of Game in Last Part of Second Half
As the shivering spectators crouched beneath their muln-colored umbrellas and the students beneath their gaudily decorated slickers, a hectic jattle was being waged on the rain- soaked gridiron in. the center of the Stadium. First a golden-hued jersey with bold, black numerals on its back would skirt speedily around or through crimson line. Later on a red jerscycd specie of the genus homo would dash hastily through the golden line; but always the red and the. gold were stopped. Many times 'is procedure was re-enacted. At t, in the waning moments of the t quarter of the game, a twinkling red was seen dashing unobserved vard the white goal posts. A all, brown object came towards, 1 was caught by him. On the ee-yard line he was downed and ee plays later a figure jumped :r a pile of sprawling humans for touchdown. It was Ted Rosen- eg, who caught the pass and ward Harpster who made the ). Both arc from Carnegie and both goes credit for scoring the ; touchdown of the day, the ;hdown that spelled victory for negie and plunged the breathless ters from. Pitt into the bottom- pit of defeat. The score was lgetl to 6-0, and 6-0 it remained, will remain, until the feud is reed next siason.
ic game fulfilled the predictions every true follower. of football lines. In somewhat plebian terms as "a humdinger." Carnegie was ted .to win and Pitt was cx- ?.d to fight. In fact, rumor has at the Pittites played a far bet- game than their well-to-bc-re- bered neighbors from Schenley . It is true that Pitt made more itional advances, more first- us and gained more yardage', but final driving punch that charac- es the truly good football team lacking. On the other hand, icgie, after bringing the ball

NEW ORCHESTRAPROMISED FOR SATURDAY FOOTBALL DANCE
A football dance will be held in 
the Carnegie Union, Saturday night, 
which promises plenty of variety 
and entertainment.
In keeping with the policy of the 
committee of providing the best music possible for its dances, they have decided to secure a new and better orchestra. The monetary assessment has been kept at $1.50 in spite of the major .improvement in tha quality of this dance, of 9 to 12 will be followed.
These weekly dances provide an outlet for the pent-up enthusiasm acquired in the six days of study preceding each dance. Although 
there is no football game this Saturday- the dance will not lack any of the pep that is characteristic of all our football dances. Health authorities agree that excessive study without recreation is harmful, therefore it is best _ to give up your books for one night and attend this dance.

One of the outstanding subjects 
for discussion at the Second Inter
national Conference on Bituminous 
Coal to be held at Carnegie Tech, November 19 to 24, will be the production of petroleum from coal. This subject, which conies under the- heading of. Liquefaction ai\d Hydrogenation,, will be discussed by several of the foremost scientists of Europe, who have accepted Dr. Bakers invitation to take' part in the coal conference. ,Foremost among these is" Dr. Friedrich Bergius, of Heidelberg, Germany, whose process for producing petroleum from bituminous coal is controlled in Germany by the German Dye Trust (I. G. Far- benindustrie) and in this country by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. Dr. Bergius, who attended the First International Conference on Bituminous Coal at Pittsburgh two years ago, has been working on the problem since 1914. Up to the time he read his paper at the Carnegie Congress' in 1926, there had/been, no large scale production of synthetic production. Shortly after this event, an arrange-' (Continued on Page 2)

inual Mum Show Opens November 4, 
With Brilliant Display of Fine Plants
ce again Pittsburgh will  be >red with a beautiful display hrysanthemums, at the Phipps iervatory, :to. brighten the dull season. The mum," show is. iiinual event in Pittsburgh and open this year on Sunday, ember 4. Its duration will ably be about three weeks, if 
weather is seasonable, n unusual scenic effect has t planned for the center house, he middle of the house a white ,ola has been erected. It is ap- ched by a narrow grayel path lered with small stones and I with chrysanthemum banks of egated colors, the tall ones dis- ing their haughty heads above gleaming whiteness of the ala- tr structure, - while the ' smaller repose more modestly at the lermost edge of the bank. If plans for the setting :do . not .arry, there will be a waxen a raven-tressed maiden of old n. sitting in the white pergola
when the doors open to the public on November 4. The purpose of this unique arrangement is to lend the oriental atmosphere of' China and Japan, for the Orient claims the honor of the birthplace of the mum.
One of the features of the show this year will be the display of the Indica, I he original muni plant. These plants have been made -to grow over a wire, framework to form a vase of green leaves with tiny flowers blooming all over it. It will be interesting for the visitor to compare the size of the original chrysanthemum with that of the more recently developed specimens, . The . original plant grows about one foot high and its- blooms are less than one-half inch in _ diameter. By comparison, the Rider Haggard specimen, .measr uring almost 10 feet in height and bearing a bloom more than one. foot in diameter, seems a veritable giant.

Womens Organizations 
Plan Scholarship Drive
Officers Are Appointed .To Arrange Benefit After Christmas Holidays
Last Friday the Womens Scholarship Organization of Carnegie Tech met to appoint an official secretary and treasurer, and to negotiate the plans for this years benefit. Eleanor Arter, junior in the Secretarial Department, was ap
pointed to the office of permanent secretary and Kay Anderson, a junior in General Science Department, to the office of permanent treasurer. These appointments complete the roster of officers for this year, the other officers having been previously  named.The final decisions upon the scholarship appointments for this semester were made. Ten scholarships are to be awarded, this semester and the committee hopes to be able to give the same number next semester. In considering the benefit for this year, it was decided that it will be. impossible to give it before the Christmas holidays.The theatre benefit which is given each winter at one of the downtown play-houses furnishes the entire funds for the scholarships. Teas and. other benefits which were formerly given are eliminated in this way. The play for this year, though it lias not yet been decided upon, will probably be similar to the one given last year. A musical comedy or light opera will be selected, if possible.The appointments to. scholarship awards are made on the basis of the recommendations of the various womens clubs and other organizations on the campus.The association was started last year, taking the. place of the various organizations -which previously had charge, of awarding scholarships.

Earl Carroll Gives Ex-1 
Opportunity To
College Athletes 
Continue In Spotlights
Latest, news reports from the 
Great White Way tell us that 
Earl Carroll, originator of the Earl 
Carroll Vanities and Earl Carroll 
Bathtub Speciaties, wants fifty excollege athletes to take part in a big new musical offering which goes into rehearsal about November 15, and is scheduled to^ open about January 1.Here indeed is a wonderful op-, portunity for those of our number whose days of heroics upon the gridiron, rifle range, or basketball? court are over. All you have to do is send a photograph-.to Mr. Carroll, jot down j'our measurements and coloring on the back, and whoopee!you may have a job on Broadway. It isnt enough that the athletes are given an option on the leading campus ladies, it isnt enough that they be pointed but at all times on the campus as Mr. So and So, the greatest quarterback that ever hit home runs into the new stands of Forbes Field, oh my no, but they must also be given the wonderful opportunity to hob-nob with the nicest bevy of beauties on Broadway, and how!We hope the boys arent forced to trip the light fantastic too soon. Since this notice has beeii posted in the field house, all the football heroes upon whom we have counted for so much, have laid
aside their moleskins, and are now practicing The Dance of the Seven Veils in place of the well- known spinner and end around. It is rumored already that Mr. Carroll plans to use our center and fullback in The Jig- of the Seven Whales, one of the features of the new show. It is rumored that petitions are circulating now among the members of the squad to effect the removal of Wally Steffen and Bob Waddell as .head coaches and appoint George White and Hindu Wassau in their places. As yet no action lias been taken.Reinforcing. of the stage of the 
Little Theater is now under way for every member of the. squad has insisted that aesthetic dancing be added to the curriculum. So, you see, those unusual noises you heard the other day werent caused by blasting or thunder. That was the football' squad doing TheDying Nymph.Anyway, its a wonderful opportunity for someone. And Ear-1Carroll wants fifty ex-college athletes for a new revue. So those athletes who are as yet at a loss for future vocations may see their name flashed on Broadway, iftheyll only . send their name,photograph, and measurements .to the Earl Carroll Theater, 755 Seventh avenue, New York City, before November 15. Step up, boys, heres the chance of a life time!

Many Alumni Return to Campus With 
Families to Participate in Reunioi 
Lunches and the Pitt-Carnegie Gan
All contributions to the Yell Contest must be handed in by the mid-, die of November. The prize offered by the Graduate Managers Office ill consist of pairs of tickets in the reserved seat section for the New York University game. So far only two yells and one football pep song have been submitted, so that there is still ample opportunity to submit the prize-winning yell.
The contest,. which began in' the middle of October, is open to any Carnegie student. Many complaints have been made by the student body about the' lack of spirit in the student cheering section. This yell contest will help determine whether the poor quality of cheering from the students is, due to lack of popular yells, or to an actual decrease - in the school spirit of the Carnegie student body. Bob Wood is anxious that as many songs and yells as possible be turned in to him within the next few weeks.

It has been stated that although Great Britain exports in -normal times many millions of tons of coal in a year, she imports more thermal units in the form, of petroleum products than she exports in the form of coal.If the native coal can be turned into oil, immense wealth will be added to the nation's resources. The same is true of the other countries of Europe where coal is f.und. Aloreovcr, since a modern battle cannot be fought without gasoline, those countries which do not have oil deposits have an added reason for making synthetic petroleum from coal.

grass and all, and it ccrtainly docs 
add to the beauty of the grounds.
Next, parking regulations arc es
tablished and we know how to 
park at least. Let us all try to consider the other fellow when parking, and perhaps a few more cars can be placed nearer the College.Then in Industries we can now get a drink without walking a mile for it. On each floor fountains are placed with the idea of eliminating the unnecessary walking. We Industries men surely appreciate this feature.Did you notice how .quickly you were registered this year? Well, this is another excellent improvement for your benefit.Look over the Campus in generaldoes it not bespeak a wonderful change all around? Each year a step forward is made.Let us ask, what arc we doing to help along? Then, perhaps, another questionHow can I help the good cause? Well, there arc two very needy projects to which you could contribute your bit.First, -the sadly needed Shelter Pavilion at the Cut, and next, the Activities Building.

At i t beginning of the next ye.tr, examination was given to in- re thorough knowledge of the 
joks read.Although no complaints on the tier have reached the faculty, *y have a desire to discover [lent opinions on the subject by us. or questionnaires.

If, however, jnajority of the pupils favor endings, they will undoubtedly 
on tinned.
*Y HOPES TO EXCEED GOAL 
AS DRIVE DRAWS TO CLOSE
The "Y drive for membership subscriptions is progressing only fair to date. The Y. M. C. A. has ;set its goal at $3,000 and the Y. IW. C. A. at $500. TJie difference in the monetary value of the respective goals is due to the fact that men's subscriptions run $3-and $5, and 'the women's only $1.
The reports of the various work-: ers arc being turned in late this year, and no accurate account can be made with respect to last years drive. It appears, however, that the percentage of subscribers to the Y. M. C. A. is higher in proportion to those who subscribed to the Y. W. C. A.The time limit for the drive has already been exceeded, but those in charge intend to bring it to a close next Friday. By that time it is expected that complete reports will be turned in by all the workers, and that the ultimate goaf of both the mens and womens organizations will have been reached.

"Who was at the game- Satur
day? asks one of the unfortunates 
who could _ not possibly attend. The questioned one obligingly enumerates their mutual acquaintances, adding a few remarks about each one, and the subfcct is dropped. The non-attender is not satisfied with the answer, however. He feels that there is something missing. He does not yet know who was at the game,
How can one adequately answer such a question by speaking of mutual acquaintances. The various groups who create the local color and the side line atmosphere must also be described.
The co-eds add color in the true sense of the word. A game certainly would be a dull one if the reds, blues, greens, and purples, comprising the collegiate misses' costumes did not stand out as beacon lights 4 to the players and urge them on to victory. It has even been rumored that at a northern college, all interest in the game was lost when,- for various reasons, women were not permitted to attend. The co-eds welcome addition to the atmosphere is certainly sufficient compensation for any inconvenience that they might cause in the way of thoughtful queries concerning the game. Per-, liaps she who asked How many quarters are there? did tax her companions ability in mathematics and cause hasty delvings into hard
learned calculus to produce the required result. But he who finally provided the information will certainly say that he was willing to do a little extra brain work for the. sake of the young ladys presence. vAlumni contribute no small share to the observer's interest in the side lines. They attend with mixed sensationsthe desire to be loyal to their Alma Mater and consequently to her present team, and a ' certainty that former teams which were active when they were undergraduates far excel the present squad. Be that as it may, the alumni come on with their usual good spirits looking forward to an evening of hilarious celebration after the game.It is in the groups of the men undergraduates that we find the most constructive comment. If the captain would but follow the abundance of good advice that issues from their midst, certainly there would be no excuse for defeats. The willingness with which suggestions arc given is really astounding. Of course yells of Down the referee! arc excusable when one realizes that any one of the undergrads would certainly prove himself more capable of filling the position than the one who has been obtained.But of course, football would not be football without this uncontrollable enthusiasm and real side-line atmosphere.
Tau Beta Pi Joins
Sigrna Tau National
The Beta Pi, national engineering honorary, held a smoker in Room \ 57, Science Building, on Wednesday, October 24. Faculty members were' present to discuss plans for the year.Eligibility requirements df new members were specified and it was decided to hold the fall call at an engineering assembly on November 20. A speaker will be obtained for the occasion.The proposed merger of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Tau, another national engineering honorary, wafe approved on the basis that they were practically identified in all respects. The granting of fellowships to Tau Beta Pi members through,the medium of a Tau Beta Pi fellowship committee was also approved. These fellowships will carry an annual stipend of $750, and will be available to nine members. These two problems will receive the major share of discussion at the national convention to be held in St. Louis on November 2 and 3. George M.

Dorms Elect New
Officers For 1928-29
With the election of officers in Henderson Hall, the dormitories have- been reorganized for the first semester of the 1928-29 term. Sco- bell Iiall holds a unique place because it has an officer whose official . title is Custodian o*t  the Plebcs. This office was created two years ago and has proved a success in regulating the dorm plebes.
The dormitories and their offi
cers arc: Scobcll Hall, Samuel Bot- .onari, president; John O. Moyer, secretary; Earl G. Miller, plebe 
custodian; .McGill Hall, F. W. McCullough, . president; R. W. Birk, vice- president; R. C. Waterhouse, treasurer; J. Bcechcy, secretary; Boss Hall, H. Brennan, president; A. B. Bevcrstock, vice president:' R. W. Kelly, secretary; Welch llall, L. Cheney, president; F. Morris, vice president; G. E. Elrich, secretary; L. T. Powell, treasurer; Henderson Hall, J. Airgood, president; C. Rosenberg, vice president; J. Anderson, secretary; P. Pcra- zelli, treasurer; Miller Hall, L. Julius, president; Englcbrecht, B. Kristof, president.
The ruling body of all dormitory action, the Dormitory Coun
cil, will be represented by R. D. Stratton, Scobcll; M. M. Warso, McGill; C. W. Armstrong, Boss; W. L. Zemberry, Welch, and T. H. Young, Flendcrson.
On Thursday, October 25, the 
students in Elements of Aeronauti

tion tour of Rogers Air Port, the 
local Army Air Terminal. The 
tour was conducted by Captain Vos, the head of Army Aviation in this territory. There was quite a variety of planes on exhibition, representing* the finest models of various manufacturers. To hear aircraft termed by names such as coupe or two and three passenger is a novel sensation, and may be the prediction of the time when planes arc as popular as cars arc. now.
An aeronautical exposition is being planned for Pittsburgh early J next year, and Barr Peat of Bettis field, who is to manage the exposition, together with Mr, Blaisdcll of the Engineering Department of Carnegie arc making arrangements to have , the plaid Carnegie plane in the exhibit.*****

BONECRUSHER KARCIS
^NDER-DOG OR NO UNDER-DOG, the Tartans 
were hard pressed to emerge Victorious in their 
annual grid tilt. In all fairness, or, give the 
devil his just dues, we would say that it was 
undoubtedly Pitts first half. However, in the 
second period the eleven snapped out of their 
listlessness and put up a scrap against which 
Sutherlands men were unable to cope. The six 
points gained could not be attributed to any 
fluke or break, but was straight football, 
with the Skibos driving irresistibly down the 
field. We are of the opinion that the Panther 
eleven was playing over its head with that occasional underdog 
brilliancy.
! L. FLANNAGAN, ROSENZWIEG, SHAUGHENCY AND 
! HARPSTER lead Steffens men in individual performance. The 
| remainder of the squad played a little under their usual game, 
i with nothing exceptionally brilliant. The defense, the greater 
j part of the game, seemed unable to stop the Panther rushes, and 
' had to fight through superb interference to get at the ball car
riers. Considering the slippery condition of the ball the con> test was exceptionally free from fumbles and poor handling.
With never a chance to show his ability, prior to this game, 
Latham Flannagan may well be proud of his afternoons work.
1 His hurdling and' ball carrying was one of the features of the 
i day. The one touchdown was made possible by Rosenzwiegs 
. difficult catch on the three yard line. It was a beautiful pass 
and a spectacular completionone which changed the whole 
complexion of the game. Shaughencys work on the end sur
passed anything he has done as yet this season. He and Rosenzwieg were equal matches for Pitts two, above the average, 
ends.
' '' 1 * * *. ' * . * + * * i
$OME INSIDE DOPE on the game: "Steffen used a sixman line ;at'i all tim.es, so Pitt would rush the ball and wear 
themselves out. They played nine men against our four center 
men, two guards and two tackles, but when they got within 
scoring distance another man wertt on the line and the Panthers 
couldnt make an inch. With their six-man defensive it was 
difficult for the Tartan plays to click, but that seventy-yard 
march for the score Avas real football. Wally sure had them 
figured right.
# * :|< :(< :|< :|: *
AS WAS EXPECTED, the Pittsburgh scandal sheets reek 
to the high heavens with Pitt praise. Alibis appear in ev^ry 
paragraph and every third word is if. With Moorehead but, 
Eyth arid Schnupp playing with injured shoulders, Melzeiner 
recovering from his operation and eight Sophomores playing 
' uicir first big game, we Were'more than satisfied with the final 
tally.
Some students wanted the vacation, others desired the cup, 
but it gave the editor much satisfaction to see the gloomy look 
on .the faces of Welsh, Kaufman, Walsh and 98 per cent of thq 
press box, when Harp crashed through.+ * * # * * ?
THE PANTHER CUBS fulilled the dope by twice crossing
the Plaid goal. The Pitt yearlings have a good club, without 
doubt superior to our first year men. Taken as a whole it was 
not an exceptionally good game, although the squad put up an 
excellent scrap and should be.complimented on the score.
Both of the touchdowns made were possible only because 
of vct;y evident breaks for the Pitt men. McCurdys fumble, 
unusual; for him, and the bouncing, interfered forward were 
direct attributes , to the opponents victory. And the toughest 
luck we know of is to. run the ball up to the live yard line., 
with all the chances of scoring, and then have the half whistle 
blow.
McCurdy gave a brilliant game with his tackling and run
ning', : while Ziegler, ran Him a close .second in performance. 
DuOanis, on the line, put up an ,excellent defensive exhibition.
Playing their final game with Penn State, Saturday, it looks as
if the Plebes will have but a one victory season.* * * * * * *
AGAIN MR. REGIS WELSH, eminent(?) sporting editor 
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, blossoms forth with his yearly 
column of dirty digs at our fair institution. Friday mornings 
paper contained a complete razz on the lack of celebration on 
the part of the Carnegie students' body over the W. and J. 
victory, and the desirability of raising much whoopee together 
with historic wholesale fist fights and taking over the town. 
Undoubtedly Mr. Welsh has been reading College Humor and 
seen an excess of Collegiate motion pictures.
IT WAS THE FAMOUS, nationally known Mr. Welsh 
who last year philosophized on the desirability of parents send
ing their children to Carnegie or Pitt, for an education, on the 
strength of. the athletic record of the respective institutions. It 
seems as if Mr. Welsh is fully determined to make a ridiculous 
ass of himself.* *
ON THE;BE-N-CH, we saw Purl Anderson, last year's -cap

the undefeated'Panther eleven for a 7-33 final tally. : * V. * : * * * *

Probably some in their excitement forgot all about the Eigh
teenth amendment; but then it -.was- damp, and pneumonia must 
be kept away at all costseven if it was five a. pint.* *.  * * * *' *.
THE PITTITES ARE WISE, they take their parade before 
the game so as to be sure of at least one chance to show off. 
We may look on with envy as we hurry to class, but still there 
is much more satisfaction in giving the city the once over

\ THE CHEER LEADERS were out in .full force, somer

quantity is of more importance than quality. We would suggest 
that a cheer for Moorehead Ayoiild have been appropriate. Paper

Varsity and Frosh Harriers 
Win from Panthers Runners
Unable to cope with the breaks 
In Saturdays game, the Plebes 
went down to defeat at the hands 
of the Pitt Frosh 13-0 in a hectic 
preliminary to the Varsity clash. 
Neither team showed any excep
tional brilliance, as both touch
downs were made on ilukes. All 
in all, it was rather an uninterest
ing encounter, and merely took up 
the allotted: time. 
-  Carnegic!s- one chance to  score 
was at the end- of the first half 
when ^Matia caught a long pass and was down within two yards of tlie-.goal line., Time was callcd, however, and this,-was the only time Carnegie was really danger- ous_-rtou t,h c;,,.Cubs.Pitts break came in the second period . when Potts recovered a pass (hat bounced off Ewings 
back and ran 50 yards for a touchdown, McDowell kicking for the extra point. But its breaks like these that make football games interesting and keep spectators; and players : on their toes very minute. 
After the first few minutes of play in the third quarter, Pitt punted to/Tech, McCurdy -fumbling on the 15 yard line. Quatsc recovered, the fumble and a succession of line bucks and off tackle plays soon pushed the ball over for a second touchdown, Murphy scoring. ^ .McDowells try for lliQ extra point was unsuccessful.The outstanding individual efforts were- McCurdy arid Ziegler in the backfield, with DuCanis playing a brilliant defensive game. Murphy of the Panther Cubs was the biggest threat.

W. A. A. PLANS HIKE
At the-last meeting of the W.! 
A. A. Board plans were made for 
a hike, which will take place Sat
urday, November 3. The Board is 
trying to obtain the use of a farm house within reasonable distance from town to which the hikers may go. If the place in question is found suitable, a formal notice | of a hike will be posted. The -hike is to be a wcek-end affair if there are not too many girls planning to stay over night. Athletic points are given for each hike attended.A special committee has been appointed by President Dorothy Roy to revise the W. A. A. Constitution. The new constitution will be printed in pamphlet form along with the new Womens Athletic point system.The Juniors and Seniors who are interested in. hockey are invited to join . the  smaller Freshmen or 
Sophomore gym classes. Hockey his not been included among the womens sports because of the lack of players, but the Board is very willing to establish it among the other W. A. A. sports and to elect a manager if the students show sufficient interest.
The sign of the Scotch was put 
upon the Panther in more than j 
one place last Saturday. But the Panther growled- and fought hard before lie was branded. A close I score of 27-28 gave the Tech cross- ! country men the decision over 
Pitts harriers here Saturday morn-: ing in a meet that continued the j list of exciting contests between the ancient rivals. This is the third successive year in which the j annual hill climbing contest between the two schools has resulted in a 27-2.8 score. Two of the three 
decisions have gone to the Hal- fcrty-coached Plaid runners.
Although Tech won the meet 
the-first two men to mark up the finish line were Pitt men,' Lacsar 
and Alberts; with Alberts follow-, ing Caesar. The next man to come' down the hill was wearing a grey Tech jersey. The onlookers ex
pected to find Salkin or Captain Campbell inside the jersey, bji.t wene pleasantly surprised to see- Worley, a sophomore runner, come 
sailing in with his. two, star teammates cloSe. behind him; i A- gold jersey,, two grey, and two more, gold followed to complete the scor
ing positions, with the jerseys belonging to the following men: Jcrpe, Anderson, Gedcon, Grossct 
and Davis.
Caesar, from the other side of Forbes street, ran- the six miles aii though lie were chasing the ghost of Brutus. His time of 29:41 
is the fastest recorded over the Schenley Park course this season: His running mate, Alberts, didnt waste any lime either, coming in 25* minutes and 58 seconds after starting out. Worleys fine time was 30:13.
Gedcon and Salkin of Tech led the march up flagstaff hill at the beginning of the race, but Caesar 
and Anderson soon decided to find: out how things looked up front;- As the leaders passed under Pan? ther Hollow bridge, Caesiir was' first, Salkin second, Alberts third,; Campbell fourth and Worley fifth.T There were hardly 30 yards between Caesar and Worley.
By the time the group had gonej around the lake to pass under the; bridge again, the positions had; changed to Caesar, Alberts, Camp-; bell, Salkin and Worley, in that order, with Worley gaining stead-4 ily. At that point in the race,; about half-way, any one of the fiveseemed to have a chance of win-: ning. The two . Pitt men stayed^ up front, however, and the only' 
change at the finish was Worley!
BOWLING SEASON OPENS
The Womens Bowling season started on 'Tuesday, October 23. So far, a large number of students have shown an .interest in the sport, but contrary to, the usual condition, the Freshmen show the smallest  percentage in attendance. 
The Junior girls are evidently cx- pecting to live up to their last years record, if their attendance at the first two practices may be taken as any indication.There remain now, just four more weeks of practice before the final tournament. It is not too late to start, for there is still time to make .s team. The teams arc composed of the best players from all the classes. It is urged that the Arts Students try to make up a team. Their attendance -has been very meager at practices. W. A. A. points for attending a majority of the practices or making a team may be made.The final tournament promises to produce some keen competition between the classes, for each class has a fair representation of high- scoring bowlers, although the total representation for each class is by no means balanced. The highest score, ,as yet, will be kept a secret, in order not to. discourage those who have never bowled before, but it may' be disclosed that a score in the thirties is riot un- bonimon..Practices are held every Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon from 2:30 to 6:30, at the Knights of 
Columbus Bowling Alleys . on- Fifth avenue.
of the beginners. Lieutenant Co- thian, of the Military Department, will be the instructor of the class. All girls of either Margaret Morrison or Arts School are eligible to come out for the team. It is not necessary to have former experience in order to engage in the. sport. Notices will be posted on the bulletin boards prior to the season,- which will give full information concerning hours of instruction and days on which - the range will be open for practice.Riile is the .only intercollegiate sport .for women at Carnegie and in the three years since rifle lias been established here as an official sport, it has been very favorably received, and has produced an excellent record. In . the National N. R. A. matches, the Womens Team placed fourth the first year and third the .second year that a team was entered. In the regular scheduled matches each year has seen the team with a considerable margin of victories.Isobel Sheppard, manager of the team, lias sent challenges- to the following teams: June 12, Ohio Wesleyan and Gettysburg; February 9, University of Nevada and Oklahoma A. & M.; February 16; University of Delaware, Drexel, University of Cincinnati; Februar3r 23, U., of Wyoming, Michigan State College, Dcpauw U., of Missouri; March 2, U. of S.

BRANDING THE PANTHER was a Tartan pastime on 
Saturday, with both the Varsity and Plebe harriers chalking up 
wins over the Pitt cross country squads. Curious enough, ir

THIS WEATHER does not bring thoughts of tennis, but 
it seems the completion of the tournament is now an assured 
fact. With the semi-finals over it has sifted down to a two way 
fight between Berghanc and Hardie. Captain Carpenter was 
taken over by Berghane and McCloskey forced Hardie to five 
sets in the semi-finals. Should friend weather frown on the 
Carnegie courts the match will be fought out on a privately 
owned asphalt court.

DRAMA DEPARTMENT
TO OPEN OCTOBER 31
(Continued from Page 1)
Golgotha. Christ does not' appear in the Play. The author voices his conviction on this matter in his prcfacc to the play. lie says You can not show Divinity on the stage; you cannot: get an actor to impersonate Divinity. You may show humanity in juxtaposition to Divinity, acted upon by Divinity and responding in one way or another 
to the contactbut Divinity itself, No! The thing is impossible.Stuart P. Sherman, one of the leading dramatic critics in America, speaking of The Dark Hours, says I believe this to be a great tragedy, greatly concerned arid written with austere sincerity. When it is adequately produced as 
I hope it may be, it should affect us as the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles affected the Greeks.
Th<i first quiirter showed the of
fensive power of the Panthers big 
guns, .Uansa arid Williams'. Uansa, 
especially showed that without him 
the Blue and Gold's offensive power 
would be materially reduced. Time 
after time he broke away and was 
not downed until several white lines 
had been crossed, Moorehead, for 
Carnegie, was performing in much 
the sanic mariner until lie was ear
ned, unconscious, from the field. 
Eyth resumed where Moorhead left off and when lie too, was removed shortly before the end ;of the half ,on account of a bump on his injured shoulder. Flannagan, another of Carnegies sterling half backs, then carried the brunt of the Plaids offense. -It. was in the third quarter that the Tartans showed the stuff o which they are made. Pitt had received one of Harpstcrs punts on the Carnegie 45-yard line. A determined drive brought the ball t(? the Plaids 11-yard line. On the next play the ball was fumbled but recovered from a 6-yard loss. Another yard was gained and left the oval on the 16-yard line, fourth down and 15 yards to go for a first down. The final spurt was a forward pass but it was knocked down and the ball changed hands. Karcis fumbled for Carnegie on the 25-yard line and Pitt recovered. Once more the Panthers started for the goal and once more the Plaid, aided by a 10- vard penalty, repulsed the attack. With the ball on the 17-yard mark, Pitt decided that three points would be better than_ none and attempted a placement kick ' for a field'goal. Edwards kick was low and Carnegie took the ball on the 20-yard line.It was in the fourth quarter that Carnegie opened up. With ihc ball on the 31-yard line, a gain of four yards started the fun. It was Lctzcl- tcr and Karcis who bore the brunt of the offense and who placed the ball on Pitts 30-yard mark. A 27- yard pass to Rosennvieg placed the Plaid but three yards from the goal. After two and a half yards had been gained through the line, Harp stcr outthought the Panthers and carried the ball over himself for a touchdown. Letzelter failed at the try for the extra point. After this score the ball see-sawed back and .forth until the game ended with a wild outburst of cheering from the Carnegie rooters.
It is no easy task to pick out the individual stars. ^ Uansa and Williams were brilliant for Pitt, and 
kept the Blue and Gold's ciicering 
scction^in a frenzy of delight. Car
negies team, however, showed no 
such great stars for the reason that 
the play ot every man was excel
lent. The backs were in rare form 
and it is \common knowledge that 
every player on the line got' his 
man, especially when Pitt was with
in the shadow of the goal posts.Its all over now until next year, Pitt is disposed of but three more teams loom over the horizon, teams that not only have reputations but proven ability. This Saturday there will be no game, but the following weeks the boys will journey tip to Albany, N. Y to tussle with Georgetown, from Washington. After that comes Notre Dame Mid then a gala celebration, let us hope. The Irish have been beaten, but that is no sign that Carnegie will have a picnic on November 17. These South Benders are waiting for the Tartans andwhen two teams want to win as badly as uo these two, the fur is bound to fly. At any rate, three weeks hence everyone will know whether to celebrate or go to schooL In the meantime, On to Albany.Summary:: Carnegie6 Pitt0Roscnzwicg L.

Plebes Win 
The Plaid Plebes opened their cross-country season with 'a 29-26 win over tlic University of Pittsburgh frosh in a preliminary '.tc? 
the varsity meet between the two schools. The frosh meet was . 'as 
close and hard-fought as the varsity meet,, which was won by Tecli with a score of 27-28.
The places taken by Pitts plcbc^ were Mazzie, first;- Monheim, fourth, Ronig, seventh; Van No- strand, eighth, and Kostin, ninth. ;
Carnegies scorers .were Reichard; second; Price, third; Mecnan, fifth; Carr, sixth, and Abbott, tenth.
Mazzie, star of Coach Sheas Pitt team, wanted to leave no doubt as to whos was the best of the field. At the very beginning 
he took the lead and held it throughout the three-mile trip. His time for the jaurit was 15:38, with Reichard and Price of Tech following at 15:56 and 16:08 respectively. These last two times were the best of the season for the two Tech leaders. r .Lord, a new frosh runner, pre-; 
sented the surprise of the meet when he placed fourth, but was disqualified becauselie was not Officially entered. Coach Iialferty was running him in the race merely to try him out. His . showing will naturally cause him to be a regular entrant fron} now on.Besides Lord, the Plaid freshman squad lias- been enlarged by the addition of Abbot, who placed tenth, Sanders and Krebs. These 
new entrants bid fair to make numerals even . though . they have 
started late. Coach Iialferty- still has more new uriiforms for any other frosh Svho wants experience for varsity competition next year.The frosh have no meet next week, but will be kept in shape by . regular practice every day. 
Coach Iialferty' has instructed the plebes to work on the varsity six- mile course exclusively, from now on. An attempt is being made to schedule a frosh meet_for Novem
ber 10. which date has been left open by the cancellation of the St. Vincents meet.

Old Man Joy and Old Man Trouble Went out for a walk one day..I happened to pass when they met on the street And I overheard them say,Said Old Man Trouble, She's as wrong as she can be, There aint no fun in anything to me, whyI was just talking'to Old^ Man Sorrow,And he says the world will end tomorrow."Then Old Man Joy he started to 'grin,And I saw him bring out that OLD BLUE TIN, Then OLD JOHNNY BRIAR was next on the scene, And he packed him full from the _ OLD BLUE TIN, And X heard him say as he walked away, You have to have a smoke screen every day.When a man gets the blues, and he needs a friend, He can find consolation in the OLD BLUE TIN, And I jist dont believe on all this earthTheres a thing thatll match good old EDGEWORTH.*

FOOTBALL GAME SEATS
Again, as ahvayi the students of Pittsburgh are forced to watch the games of their college teams from seats not the _ most advantageously situated with consideration for inter-school demonstrations and the general viewing of the contests. With a stadium available in which there has always been a surplus of seats, there seems to be no adequate reason why both Pitt and Carnegie students should not enjoy the privileges held /by the undergraduates of other large institutions. Who is more vitally interested in a game than the .classmen of the schools whose teams are on the field? Why should they not have positions on the filly-yard line, and on opposite sides of the stadiumthe ideal location for demonstrations between the halves and for competition between the schools bands?It: is recognized that a much ' greater, revenue is realized from .uid-field scats, and that it takes .lo.ney to conduct a football season, but. with a bowl of the seating capacity of The Stadium there should certainly be little difficulty in adjusting a rate to spit the needs of the students, and without hampering the returns from other ticket sales. In the years to come, when Carnegie takes over its position as a constant occupant of The Stadium for all home games, one block of scats On the fifty yard line, extending from the inner, to the outer rim, and adequate to seat the student body, should be maintained as the Carnegie Tech section. With such an arrangement, it would then be possible for our cheerleaders to .properly organize in advance such spectacular paper demonstrations as have long been hoped for, but have proved impractical without sufficient preparation.
CHAPEL
Today the second bi-monthly chapel sendee is being held in the Little Theater of the College of Fine Arts at 11:30, with a prominent Pittsburgh minister delivering a short address. The first chapel sendee held two weeks ago was very well attended and the Y. M. and' Y. W. C. A. organizations, who sponsor these meetings, are hopeful that the attendance will remain at a high figure. Why. not attend chapel more regularly?These religious services are .entirely non-rsectarian, and offer an appropriate period for thought, and meditation in the midst of a crowded and busy college life. Such details of life are too frequently neglected while students are away from familiar home groups, and there are many Carnegie undergraduates who have never attended a chapel service. Such persons are nost cordially invited to relinquish for a brief half hour their minor ares and worries, and take part the refreshing atmosphere of the pel period.Y.
OFFICIAL NOTICES
The Carnegie campus has recently seen the results of tampering with official Student Council business. Not content with creating a doubt in the minds of many members of the student body conccrn- in;-v a school holiday a week ago, person or persons . took itupon themscdvcs highly involved b flense againstlaws of the
to become very in a criminal t h e FederalUnited States.The penalty for forgery in this country is an extended, period of internment in the nearest government penitentiary! The seriousness of such an act is not to be ignored, iither from the standpoint of legally or good citizenship. Any stu- jent who - purposely opposes in -.-'i a manner the action of a bod}
"Lcmel Gulliyer, who was as careful as an observer as he was rash as an. explorer, was astonished to find a kingdom divided on the question whether an egg should be broken at the broad end or the' narrow end; lie would have been quite as astonished doubtless to find among' ourselves' an equally heated argument as to relative merits of a broad human head and 
a narrow one.
In both- cases, however, it would be necessary to burrow a little deeper and to regard the points at issue as mere symbols of some deeper grounds for dissension. If, for example, the question of which end of an egg should be broken had been a mere matter of personal psychology, a difference of individual taste, and no more; then there would not have been enough social, friction to generate the inr ordinate heat of which . Gulliver tells us. But as this heat certainly was generated, we are led to conclude that something else lay behind; that egg breaking in a special manner had become the standard or symbol of a special class in society; that those with an income of more than five thousand dollars brcjke the thick end and those with a smaller income the thin; or that those. who could appreciate Stravinski and the American Mercury did one thing, while those who only' read the less intelligent press, the other; or that college graduates, or oil kings, or people on the Bs visiting list or what not, regarded the alternative to their own methods as the mark of the beast."
Then every one would desire to prove his method of egg breaking the true mark of aristocracy and, by remembering the rule, parvenus would hope to become worthy, for example, of kissing the 
hand of a grand duchess.
In precisely the same way people will desire to prove that their head shape, or eye colour, or ac^ cent, or table manners arc superior to those of other people, and as this is a quasi-scientific generation they will ask p backing of science to prove that they are the chosen people, just as their forefathers in a quasi-religious age went on the same quest to the Bible.
There are three social prejudices, which exercise constant pressure on the average mans thought; colouring it, and making it irrational: they are, first, my country, race, or nationality are better than the other mans; setond, my class, social caste, or social habits are better thah the other mans; and, third, my moral code, religious outlook, guidebook to heaven, are better than the other mans. In the old days, for example, if an Englishman found that he Had nothing in common and no sympathy with a Brahmin, lie said he had no use for niggers and left it at that; and most people forgave him' his very human failing of race
prejudice. But, nowadays, thanks to the .great advances of popular science, he is ashamed-to leave his prejudice naked for all to see and seeks to cover it with a sort of scientific synthetic figleaf composed of words like dolichocephalic, brachycephalic,. Nordic, miscegenation and the like. Thus to the heftnely and. pardonable vicc of race prejudice is added the far more dangerous and corroding vicc of intellectual snobbishness.First, a race type exists mainly in our own minds; true, a Negro has a dark skin and woolly hair, but. many southern Europeans have darker skins than some Negroes. Let us admit, however, the aver-j age difference in . certain physical j characters; what is important is that our picture of mental differ-1 enc.es -is purely subjective. Clearly, I most Negroes are socially lower than most whiles; we .say .that it is because it is in their germplasitt that they should be lower, but that is false. The true cycle of events is this: Negroes are unlike us in many ways, physically and in their ways of doing things, their traditions in fact; people with different traditions from our own are felt to be inferior; we treat them as inferior and as a result they do become inferior. Life is a hurdle race wherein most of the hurdles are social prejudices, I for Negroes we raise the hurdles a foot and yet are surprised that more of them trip- up.There is no doubt, to take another example, that many American Indian communities were, before the coming of the white races, noble, aesthetic and religious, often beyond our own standard; we give them drink, diseases and an alien code of beliefs and morals; we take from them occupation, land, legend and tradition; then we look 'at the few which we have kept and domesticated for use as movie extras and complacently think of our own superiority.In short, all the inferiorities or superiorities which some people attribute to race are really attributable to good .and bad education, in the widest meaning of the word that it, .all the influence to which the individual has been subjected from birth upward.It is environment, education, social milieu that counts, and not race, and Americas problem is to mitigate the shock and dislocation when an alien finds himself uprooted and transplanted. That some of the seedlings are not the best that could be obtained, is true, but this is not because of racial inferiority; it is because the type 
of immigrant, who. has been most in demand in the' past is often of doubtful quality. If America had set out'to attract Dantes and Benedetto Croces she would have had no alien problem at all, but the fact is, she set out to attract cheap labor and as a result she has got Chicago.New Age of Faith.J.

. Campus Week j
'What a medley of sounds thoe two - words recallgay laughter, peppy music, hilarious voices. What a meaning those two words have for an undergraduate; what pleasant memories rush to the mind of a loyal alumnus when' those words arc Uttered! Even to a casual passerby, Campus Week has a certain significance. Yet the Executive Council has ruled that there shall be no more Campus Weeks!This ruling is no more whim of the Councilreally believes that such.is the right thing to do. But they have not been informed of the students viewpoint. So the students voice their opinions as- a group and as individuals: and by constant and . sincere urging . they hope to succeed in putting across Carnegie Techs, usual successful Campus Week.
To abolish Campus Week would undoubtedly, cast an anchor in Carnegie Techs wheel of progress. Why? A very simple reason will suffice: a students happiness depends upon anticipation. Why strive for anything if there is nothing to 
look forward to? To be specific is a year of constant study inter-' spersed With a few minor social events something to look forward to? It is not. A .college student is too. energetic for such staid routine. A course like that would cause _ him to become restless and dissatisfied. He would accomplish much more, by a three-day release frm classs, when he gives vent to natural enthusiasm, than he would by attending classes all during the spring months .with a mind made listless by monotpny and inactivity. Why does a student attack his books with increased vigor as the- May breezes make their debut? Anticipation is' the answer Campus Week is just ahead.
Above all, does the Executive Council realize that they ,are erasing one of the most beautiful things that mark a college-tradition? Carnegie Tech must retain its foremost traditionCampus Week. Our tradition, our distinction, our anticipationCampus Week. Wc shall have Campus Week!

When the action of the Student Council concerning such 'matters has not previously been made public, the cheerleaders have the authority to make such announcements and their statements may be followed.

.Oh, I'll not. be the. least trouble,.said the fady boarder,.-who had wheedled the mistress of a 
select boarding house into taking her for six months, although the mistress had said that she never, never would take another woman to board.I dont blame you for not wanting to board women, said the lady boarder, while, laying off her wrap in her room, most of them are a# troublesome and- finicky, but .1 think youll find Im not one of that sort. I just take things as I find them and make no fuss at all. Now Ill just wash my hands, andO, could you get me a little 
white Castille soap instead of this cocoanut-oil kind?Ill see, said the landlady. 
And'about the towelsI never use crash quite so rough as this, and Id like' a Turkish towel on the rack all the time.Well.
Thank you, Im determined not to be ir6ubles.ohie after I once get settled, and Idont you think .this dressing-case would look better on this side of the room?
1 dont know.Seems- to me it- would. Sup- ppsing you call a servant up and 
let us see how it will look moved: and while shes here I believe Ill change the bed to the other cor
nerthat. is, if youve . no .objections.
O,. none at all.Thank you. 1 dont really care much, but thenO, would it be too much trouble to have a cup of hot water sent up to my room an hour before each meal? I think it does me good."
I suppose I can arrange that, says- the landlady, gloomily;Thanks; you are kind. Now, I guess Ill-O. I wonder if there is any hot water in the bath room? Id like to run in and just wash out a few little things' that I never send to the laundry. Ill not be a bit' of trouble.

WHO CHEERS CARNEGIE ] 
AT FOOTBALL GAMES?,Book Review
C-a-r-n-e-gie! C-a-r-n-c-gie! The battle cry sounds over the bloody field of football as our lusty warriors fight for the glory of Carnegie. Yea, Carnegie, we yell. We, We, -who are We?
Wc are engineers, or, to be more precise, -would-be engineers. We pull a few of our noses from our books long enough to tell the world, or, rather, the sporting fans, that we have a football team. The rest of us, w'ho stick to the grind and we arc legionhaven't time to cheer for a husky eleven. Why should we? Arent we busy? Havent we too much to do al-' ready, with assignments piled up, with books to try and get at the Hut, with laboratory hours to loaf through or slave through?; ' We' must-get ready to do the Worlds work. _ We have to give up, with too-willing sacrifice, our dates, our recrcation, our pleasures, so that we may do'our Math, our Physics, our technical reports. Indeed1' yesi we are a. serious .lot, are we.
 We arc Architects, wrc are Musicians, we are Dramats. We -loll through German, Italian, History of Art, that we may wander through Art School looking artistici We swagger through the dim halls of our nice building with the thinlyrveiled satisfaction of being different expressing itself through our intellectual talk, our disdain of everything not first-rate, our disapproval of ordinary things, such as families. We smoke cigarettes with evident relish; the women of us delight in filling the Round Table room with the smoke of the suppo'sedly-taboo fag. We slave for hours in almost complete self- forgetfulness on the back-stage directions of a play, at the really delightful violin or organ, on inspiring, if strenuous, Charettes.We are Maggie Murphs, deliberately placing ourselves in a women's school because we ' honestly Want to learn. Wc. struggle with Physics and Chemistry, we' wade or slip through Biology, we lose ourselves in Bacteriology, Dressmaking, Case .Work. Wc have time to be the girls whom Pitt men like- to take out. We or-; ganizc clubs of Chemists, of Sec- retarials,. of Social Workers, and we have'parties and rallies. Why' not? _ We like to dig, -fte are here to dig, but we are women just the same. We might be grinds, but we- wont be back numbers. Youll see us jrelling for Carnegie Tech. Were not cast in a mould we're individualists!Yes, and were _ all  collegiates. Our Plebe regulations are grand sops to our pride. Our honorary fraternities reward us for our good hard plugging. Our cxtra-cur- ricular activitiesa few of us have, emmake us think w'cre imp'or- tant.- We fall for our classificationswere Engineers, were Maggie Murphs,'were Dramats. .Youd know us anywhere.
O, Ill get around hei;' easily, enough. Trust: me for that. 1 always wash out my handkerchiefs and sriiall pieces wherever I board, and IO, while I think of- it, Id like to mention that I never drink' 
anything but/green  tea, and if it would not be too much trouble Id 
like my bread made without. a bit. of salt iii it. Perhaps it's only a notion, but I cant eat sailed I read
v.I hardly know how to manage that, says the landlady dubiously.O, itll be easy enough. When you bake just make one loaf without salt in it. See?  I hope you
wont take a bit of trouble on my account if Im sometimes too late for my. meals. Sometimes I may be out shopping or may feel a little lazy in the morning and
wont get up, but Ill soon findout where things arc in the pantry and will just help myself without troubling, anyone.
^ This, struck the landlady so dumb that she could say .nothing, and the- obliging boarder guiltlessly, lattled on.
I like. hot cakes for breakfast the year round, and somehow, no kind of steak agrees with me but 
sirloin. Would you mind ringing for a .servant and . have _ her. lower 
the window a little from the top 
O, I see the blankets on the bed j the room h arc white. Its a foolish notion of. | mind.

Here is a book that will suit the taste of the -most fastidious- tapestry woven of rich and luscious words chosen punctiliously for their weight and color. Miss Mirr- less has conceived a gorgeous myth-peopled with beings who inhabit strange places. The reader sits as at a puppet show enacted on a distant stage viewing a fan- tasmagoria through a powerful glass, bringing near the far-away actors.
In this blending of'the poetic and: the bizarc, some reader's will see a similarity to Jurgen. But added to the sophistication of Cabell will be found the scholarship of the Golden Bough, the quaintr ness of' Hawthorne, the- charm of Hans Christian Anderson, and the weirdness of Poe. Couple the whimsicality of Barry -with the horror of Dracula, and some conception may be had of the scope of its appeal.
- For - those who love1 words for the nicety and rouudness of their sound, Lud-in-thc-Mist will be a gold mine. The nomenclature which Dickens bestowed upon his characters were not selected with greater discrimination. Imagine the school mistress, Miss Primrose Crabapple, Professor Wisp, the dancing instructor, and Mother Tibbs, the matronly custodian of the Fields of Grammary, where the sturdy dead lads hoist their own coffins on their shoulders and trip it over the daisies. And when the elite of the village, consisting of such notables as Dr. Endymion Leer, Dame Dreamsswcct and Hyacinth. Baldbreeches sit at banquet, the dishes sound like a scries of -tragic sonnets. The first 
course was called the Bitter-Sweet Mysterya soup of herbs . . . followed bjr the Lottery of Dreams, which consisted of _such delicacies as quails,' snails, chickens livers, plovers eggs, peacocks- hearts . . . Then came True-Love-in-Ashes,. a special way of preparing pigeons; and. last, Deaths -Violets, ^ an extremely indigestible - pudding deco-! rated with sugared violets. in Flower-in-Amber wdne, the party drinks the health of the King of Moongrass Cheeses. So proceeds the lavish.poetic,iare. -But even in this peaceful place life has. its fill of tragedy. Prunella Chanticleer and her playmates have eaten of fairy fruit and have passed beyond the Debatable Hills to that deliciously bad place, the very name of which was held in horror by: the- citljiensvThen something happened. It was not so much a modification of the darkness, as a sigh of relief, a slight relaxing of tension. so( .that one felt, rather than saw, that the night had suddenly lost a shade of its .density . . . ah! yes; there! between these ..two shoulders of the hills she - is bleeding -to death.
Prunellas father eoes in search Of--them and passes a strange night at, the Fair in the Elfin. Marshes where a ghoulish carnival is in progress. The maidens are finally restored and each gaye a different account of tli^ir adventures. Moon- love . Honeysuckle said they ' had' danced wildly down the waste, places of the sky, and then had been imprisoned in a castle in the moon; Viola Vigil said, they had been chased by angry trees into the Dapple, - where they, had got entangled in the weeds and could not extricate themselvesand so on.This is not a book for the casual reader, but a "fairy tale for the sophisticated, beautifully done. The house of Knopf has encased the volume in a distinctive format, suggestive of its content.
Were awfully glad to beT with you'again and we hope that you are at least-half so glad to see us. 
Its really fun to climb up on top of a fence and do nothing but look around. Of course, theres always the possibility of tearing ones stockings; but thats only a minor detail and can easily be discounted. Wc arent sure just what fence itthat were supposed, to be sitting on, but we hope its, the Senior Fence. It would be a distinction 
for a co-ed to be allowed to -use the fence, wouldnt it?
All the arts studes are keeping their, thumbs crossed and hoping awfully hard that the Arts Balt will come. off. Whether it does or docs not really is not of so very much, difference'.to the supposedly less aesthetic' Maggie Murphs and engineers, but it is fun to think that something like that is going 
on, even if one cant be among those, present. Besides the affiur is a real Tradition/ and - it will be a sliame if it has to be eliminated'.
We certainly hope that by the time this goes to press the workmen will have finished, tinkering with the Margaret Morrison doors. Wc simply cant remember from hour to hour whether we arc to use the centcr right or left exit. Its worse than being in a play. Invariably, before a quiz,-we swing through-one of the revolving door* only to discover .that we arc walking under a ladder of -tremendous proportions.- - Such conditions are really, deplorable, - especially to anyone as superstitious^ as Vc.
If TH E * QUARTERLY* isn't organized pretty soon, well begin to 
give up hope. Certainly after the good start. that was made  last semester, the project' shouldnt be dropped. Whats the matter with everyone? Is it lack of energy or interest, or. both? Surely there are plenty of students who would like to contribute to the magazine, if someone would organize it. Why not get going? If its' going to be a QUARTERLY there really should 
be four sues, you know.

Were not trying to drop sarcastic remarks about that most illustrious of all eating emporiums, as other coliiriinists have done in the past. The line seems to move much faster, there are more tables, so that one never has to stand around waiting, and some of the prices have gone down. Also, we think the new sign out front .is 
most enchanting..
In our limited career as a con- ccrt-gocr wc have never seen three more delightfully charming women on one stage than Madame Homer and her two daughters.: -We,couldnt, of- course, attempt to give here a musical critique, but there arc always other things that one likes to mention. In the first place, the idea of a famous artist performing With her Children is, in itself, unique. The graceful carriage and poise of Madame Homer was lovely to.sec, and quite a relief after having seen Marion Talley and her jumping-jack exhibition last year, and several other performers of equal awkwardness. All three were dressed in exquisite taste, with a simplicity most unusual on the concert. stage. Miss Beegle  was certainly, wise, in her selection of an opening concert. We hope she brings them here soon again.
London.Science, beginning dimly to understand the meaning of life and death, may find itself working for ccnturics before it possesses any considerable knowledge or understanding of the great twin mysteries, Professor Frederick K. Donnan said iii an article in the Evening Standard.Perhaps no ultimate' solution ever will be attained, continued Professor Donnan. No doubt the final answer' to all our restless questioning lies in the pot of gold where the rainbow eiyjs.Professor Donnan v/as amplifying his recent speech before the British . Association  for the Advancement of Sciencc at Glasgow. There he had told of . discoveries made by .Professor A. V.

last - few. weeks. The summer of 1928-should ..be remembered-in history:- .as.; a -. continuous spasm of progress:-: .-.The surprising, thing 
about most .of these inventions is the . anonymity .of the inventors. We remember Stephenson and Morse and Bell; our children will 
see their pictures in the: school books for many generations. But what name emerges from Jhe bril-- 
liapt .summer of 1928 as immortal? The average American could not mention a single name as associ
ated with any of the recent great inventions. Yes, perhaps lie could mention one name, that of~ George- Eastman in connection with the 
color camera. But who invented the color camera?- Not Mr. East
man or even the able head of his research laboratories,' Dr. C. E. 
Kenneth Mees. The inventor was a man who spent 10 years in the Eastman, laboratories studying color photography. His name is John G. Capstaff. Three cheers for Cap- st.aff! .We would like to see.Cap- slaff cigarets, and pictures of Capstaff blindfolded selecting Old Gold and- babies- named Capstaff Jones, and -yacht's -christened Lady Cap

To the intellectually curious, his
tory'is the ultimate study. What we 
are and how we came to be that 
way, and such impertinent questions 
can be resolved only in the light of 
the past.
To be sure, most of the profes
sional historians have .proved disap
pointing to our imaginary student who is eager to rake over the coils of other years and other times, the better to understand his own. Clio- must have been the goddess of liars as wdl as o history. Although!,, to 
be sure, the greatest objection is not on the score that many of the offi- dal scribes have strung long tales and windy yarns, but rather that they have set out to rationalize and apologize for the imbecilities and crudties perpetrated by their rulers and paymasters. This fact has been driven home decisively and is known to large numbers of the citizenry today ever since Robinsons Mind in 
the Making has been published in a dollar edition and H. G. Wells Outline of Plistory Las been altered to the public in a variety of deferred payment and subscription plans. .It will not be amiss, however, to reiterate the point. The lords and masters of old, on bitter, cold -and dreary days, or when ennui seized them, called in the official keeper of the archives, who there and then ic- countcd the glories and valiant deeds oi the ruling house. This was all done to the lulling accents of a harp or zither or lyre, the more to anaesthetize the critical questioning spirit, or what remained of it among the populace of the court. Later, when larger political nations were formed and a variety of folklore and tradition had to be amalgamated into a feeling of common background for the various peoples making up the ncW union, as in the case of France, it became neccssary to invent huger lies and stouter talcs. History became a record-of the battles (which had been. won), and the piling up of monstrous defamations and slanders upon the other peoples.. On certain grand occasions, it was even possible to call down divine recommendation and approval ror ones own folk. The national boundary separated the clcct from the barbarian.

MEISLE-THOMAS RECITAL
An old favorite and a newcomer opened 'the current, season of the Art Society last Friday  night, in Carnegie Music Hall.Kathryn Meisle, contralto, was the familiar and admired singer, and lt,r Thomas, tenor, recently- trpm Wales, proved an agreeable surprise.Miss Meisle last Friday night showed a greater versatility, and 
comprehension than at .any previous visit. Her voice is the. same, glorious. product as it was in other visits; but . her style, seer- to: have, more depth of. emotion, and 'she is less concerned with studio. ..trifles and much more interested in art songs.She scored in aria, recitative and straight, song projection. ; She had . a remarkable style in  registering her .phrases... There as-. only, ouc bad tone, in Tier marvelous range, and that was when she- finished? up the Rossini Barber  of Seville,., -when she over-readied-:her leger line register. . _ .. - :v, In the Haydn Spirits - Song, - she was. magnificently comber,The Droop. Not wras done  in Hande.han manner, with ample regard for the passing notes and an appealing allar- gando ending. Richard Strauss contributed in his Schlechtes Wetter, one of his characteristic piano backgrounds. It was a beautiful song-in every respect.Some contraltos have a touch of brass in their top Es,  but Miss Meisle is pure bronze, with a ..glow of gold, as to with the Saint Saens 
Samson and Delilah episode. She gave this aria tristcss and great color. -Mr. Thomas - as a victim of a cold, which caused him to.-open in a husky manner. Jiis upper notes did not come smoothly and his middle register was marred v/itlr a "terrific vibrato. As the evening^ wore on his voice improved, and when he arrived at the Welsh folk songs there was some semblance of the voice we were prepared to hear.
Which is wafted to us today by the 
newer delvcrs into the past! How 
eagerly and with what exceeding 
gustoj does the newer historian pull 
down the carefully erected edifico 
and tissue of fabrications erected 
about the personalities of the groat 
and the near-great! At the present 
moment, there can be espied ah army 
of research workers combing through 
the dusty stacks of the great librar
ies, with fountain pens drawn, ready 
to destroy reputations and put to 
rout the shades of the past.
No one is immune. Among the 
more rcccnt exploits of these depre
dations and one which is sure to 
cause consternation and dismay in 
certain circles is the low-down fur
nished^ upon  King David, of Biblical 
fame, by. Elmer Davis, in his book 
entitled Giant Killer.* One does not begin to question. Davids batting average or his. ability as a .political impressario, as", a result of reading this book, but oiic is certainly taken abadv by. tile conception of his personality as therein, presented. Thu Sunday school-. story is. revamped considerably. And . on the basis of the best scholarship at that, for Davis has made use of the. soundest conclusions of rcccnt research on this subjcct. .The story as now revealed is a fascinating chronicle of the deeds of an artist-politician, wierd combination indeed. Not in the mood of * rhapsodical pancgyric nor a fishermans. yarn, but as a straightforward 
impressionistic study of an cgotisti-' cal genius. At the most critical junctures of the violent and war-lika politics of his time, when new rulers rose through slaughter rather than by means of ward-hcclcrs, David could be .discovered strumming on the harp aiid improvising songs. And yet, he managed to take advantage or the. breaks of his opponents and with a. ruthless hand to have his giants killed for him by his henchmen, especially by the man of blood, Joab. It is a continual delight to pass through a story such as this which insinuates an ancient atmosphere and time and draws one iqto the sceiia as a participant and boon companion of old. King David. The past does not lose'its glamor and the'big figures  emerge from their niumth'ified distortions, creatures of circumstance and hopelessly weak and inconsistent like us all even unto this day..There are those who refuse to fall into the big parade or to leap on tli band wagon merely to swell the ego of a bloated egotist or to crcate an historical .figure. The thorough 1 going democratic spirits among us pour 
contempt upon these personalities, who arc as often as not swathed in a tissue of lies. Our hearts go out to the common man and woman whu sweated and strained and bled. Unnamed and unknown, but ycC tin builder of empires. Therefore1, w<j turn to the study of culturc-history, in which the buideu of the taV. :o the story of the customs and tlim modes of . the ordinary manhow hrj worked .and amused himself. An example of a rcccnt attempt to resur- rect the spirit of a culture is tha long poetic narrative of the Civil war era, by Stephen Vincent Beuct, called John Browns Body. This is a magnificently moving aiid kaleidoscope treatment of four hectia years in the history of America. The heroes arc there but the feel of tlia times arc. recorded rather throtigU the experiences of ordinary soldier a and citizens. A school book history cannot possibly convcy the lecling o immediacy and pulsating reality that is achieved here.Still, there arc rare souls who insist upon discovering a "meaning-or trend or philosophy of history. 
To date, this sca/ch has proved dis
appointing. But it is nevertheless fascinating. 'To derive a casual sequence out of a rccord of dark deeds on a tangled skein, ip iio mean,' intellectual feat. Someone, has said that we learn from, history that wit learn nothing from history. This does not daunt such spirits for example,as Virginia Woolf, the Eng-< lish writer, from wresting with Ilia problem, even though in a semi- serious manner. In her latest- \Vork, Orlando, a figure is crcated and traced through the centuries from the time of Queen Elizabeth to tjicj 
present. It is a brilliant work it# which the person at one slagq changes his sex in the next. era. Thq upshot of it all is this in the'opin-v ion of one reader, a decidedly caustic treatment of the idea of time* which seems to hold us in its thrall, today and in .this part of the world especially.These are the <;ort of history books that .satisfy.r In our passion for modernity; rose-tinted glasses will' not do nor will offidal blinders stay our impatience to. see the past unadorned. The sight of a hat- fiva years old is enough to caiisc galea of. laughter,. yet we insist on having our history straight and are ready, to stand the consequences. (N. M
