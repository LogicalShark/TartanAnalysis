UNCONCERNED IFACTS AND FANCIESMEMORANDA
ODE. DORMS AND THE PLEBES
. A new problem has transpired-on our campus, 
due to the enforcement, of;th fraternity rushing 
regulations as set. by the inter-fraternity; council 
!lpst spring.,In &eipB6t .yearB the incoming;plebe
was literally'swept off his.-feet in trying to make up. his engagement boot-to satiEfy- the members 
of different fratmitiea. ;He' forgot his studies 
and.thought of nothing-bit .'r&t' dances, dinners, plays, et cetera ad :mfinitum; ; This yiiar, the 
class, of 30.must eat, dance and: play-go on the 
strength ; of its own pocktbook as tiie drastic new 
rules allow no  intercourse; of plebes.witi^ upper
classmen : in .a mnneri; tbat:.in any way-might be 
construed- as. fraternity -ru&ingV, Thus , is the 
plebe. left alone lwitK,ius studies, to. conquer as he 
can without any interference from. upper.classmen, more than th well too familiar and dreaded 
calllof: All plebes.out/'There is one woeful result, of the new ruling. 
The mens dormitories, built many years ago 
-(when fraternity rushing took .place as soon as 
the pleb was. registered), were amply able to 
accommodate th influx from year to year. If 
one could not get a room in the dormitory imme
diately on entering, school he could surely get ft 
room by the end of two weeks, or as . soon as the 
riewly-pledged men had moved to their respective 
fraternity houses. _ This year a,plebe, not being able to obtai a 
room in the-dormitory, must seek elsewhere. The 
geographically, minded, he. chooses the Oaklanddistrict. Here he is.'thTown n his own resources 
more than, ever and is often ^ apt victim of melancholi, which, coupled with a natural desire for 
.activiiy, forces.him to abandon himself to every whim. Moreover; -the average student comes 
from a small, town-where;people still, run to a 
-fire and he is quite unable to. be immediately acclimated to'this throbbing city ; oi ours. There^ 
fore, the long stay: away, from the campus, neces
sitated as it is by the lack'of ; dormitory room, is 
not apt;to be conducive to -.lusty mental state. I
