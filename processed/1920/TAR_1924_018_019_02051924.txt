MORTAR BOARD TO HOLD
BRIDGE PARTY MARCH 1
The Gymnasium building will prob
ably be used for nothing but basket 
ball games this year. Such was the 
statement of Professor Esquerre, 
charge d affaires of the magnificent 
athletic studio, when he was asked 
about the plans for its use.
The two reasons which he gave 
were that the building itself would 
not be ready for student use untdl 
late in the spring and that no set of 
regulations has been ratified by the 
administration.
An investigation showed that tilie 
finishing touches are even now being 
applied to the structure. All the 
plastering will be done by the end 
of this week. Half the tile of 
the pool has been laid. In three 
weeks the rest will be down, and in 
one more the concrete floor will have 
been put in,
Switch boards and lighting fixtures 
are being installed. Window frames 
have been painted inside and out. In 
the administration section of the 
"building the doors have been fitted, 
set and painted.
The color of the interior trim in 
the administration offices is cream. 
The walls and ceiling of the mens 
gymnasium are not always to retain 
the unfinished appearance which they 
now present.. They are to be sprayed

ASSEMBLY TO TAKE 
PLACE IN NEW GYM
Wally I Steffen Accepts Dr. 
Bakers Invitation to Speak 
to Studes
The first General Assembly of tlie 
192.4 Semester will be held in the 
new gym. This, alone, should be suf
ficient reason to attract the majority 
of the students who have watched 
tihe development of a much needed 
addition to the Carnegie Tech Camp
us, will welcome the opportunity for 
rallying under its roof on Tuesday, 
February 12. All Plebes will be re
quired to march in body under super
vision of the Sophs. Another reason 
why everyone will enjoy this assem
bly is that it promises to bo short 
and snappy. Heretofore a few have 
been shorti and  few have been snap
py, but popular opinion craves a com
bination of brevity! and pep, and at 
this assembly an attempt will be 
made to please everybody.
President Thomas S. Bakers co
operation and sympathy with student 
interests are responsible for the 
speaker of the day, whose presence 
will undoubtedly prove a startling de
light for everbody. Upon the direct, 
invitation of Dr. Baker, Judge Walter 
P. -Steffen of Chicago, otherwise 
known as Coach Wally Steffen, will 
give a short address.
In asking our Wally" to be tflie 
next assembly speaker, President
Baker has conferred a significant hon
or upon him by the fact that he is 
to be the first speaker to address the 
.students ati an assembly in th gym
nasium. It is a high tribute to
Coach 'Slteffens qualities as an indi
vidual and a man of affairs that the 
administration, through President
Baker, has invited our famous foot( Continued on Page Three.)

after the game.
The man at the door will ask to

muscles in the Union with sweet 
Rosie OGrady herself for a partner, 
and it will cost you only a dollar

Campus Comment
By SARA MAE EVERETT
Mr. Wallace presented' the Froshmen of the Drama Department In Ilio 
Maseiilold Esther," the week of Jan
uary 21.
Though tills apearanco culminates 
the usual throe or 'four months' 
surmising and wondering obout the 
general and indlviual value of tho 
now students, it does not remove tho 
fact that time alono will determine 
ouch students capacity for develop
ment.
Esther" was an unusually success
ful production for tho first, appoarance 
of Fresh men---though later on or at 
the end of tho year It may not havo 
surprised us,
Mr. Wallace produced beautiful 
pagoantry, beautiful chorals and a 
wollachloved, variety In tho verse. 
Aleno Gregory, a numi her of tho 
Freshman class, wrote a prologue for 
tint play. Her verso was more than 
adequately titled to tho stylo, porlod 
and vorse of Esther," and the Fresh
men may well bo proud of the Ph. D. 
member:; of thejir class.
Glmrlottlo Slchumanu, a graduate of 
tho P. & S., a student In produc

Freshman class. Miss Schumann's

The aim and good of this column is 
to refute the well established belief 
that the average college student has 
no clearly formed conceptions or well 
defined opinion pf any matter apart 
from his daily, studies and customary 
amusements, by recording here the 
spontaneous reactions of various per
sons connected with the school upon 
questions of current interest.
The question: Are you in favor
of adopting the honor system at Car
negie.
Professor10. T. Geckler, head of the 
Mathematics Department says:
I think that a real honor system 
(and by a real system I mean one un
der which all students will co-operate 
with the governing machine to detect 
cribbing) can be instituted in the 
three upper classes, but not in the 
Freshman class."
Professor Leeds, head of the De
partment of Machine Production 
says:
"I am heartily in favor of the honor 
system, and I am convinced that It 
will be a suocess If put Into operation 
at Carnegie."
Mr. Swanson cf the History Depart
ment:
I believe that the honor system Is 
a very successful institution, but be
fore it could be introduced here the 
proper attitude must be developed to
wards the honor system."
Cy Hoenniger, Civil, 25, says:
The Honor System is a fine ono, 
but it could never be a success here 
because the work Is too hard. It 
might work on exams, but if students 
didnt help each other out on home 
work, there would be a large crop of 
failures.
The committee for the Sophomore 
Banquet has engaged the Tartans to 
dispense the Intoxicating strains of 
jazz at the class feast on the 15th. 
Plans for the evening already give 
promise of ono exciting night. Sec
tion leaders will begin a concerted 
ticket sal on Thursday.
The Tartans have lately won much 
favor on the campus for their faithfu!, yet pepful, renditions of the mu
sic a la mode. The Sophomores are 
expecting music extraordinary that 
night and the orchestra selection 
gives assurance that there will be no 
disappointment.
A. C. Lackey refused to divulge 
anything about the program/ which 
ho has prepared for tlie occasion.

ture he admitted that he might de(Contlnued on Page Four.)

The Mortar Board girls havo Oiken 
upon themselves to help the Shilling

the Shilling Is not being supported by

It should bo remembered that tlie

publications must havo the support of

on his cap and gown for the occasion; 
All that is needed to make tho rally 
and bonfire the biggest ever, and the 
best, is tho blggost turnout, of the stu

they born 'that way or Is it a case of

for mistaking you as a Plobo," I says, 
In hope of soothing his somewhat ruf

Mistake, hell, those Sophomores 
aro too dumb to make a mistake. And 
anyway, if It was a mistake it- might 
a been excusable. Some people just 
cant help being dumb. But that 
aint It. Just now I was fighting with 
one of Skibos hamburgers and a cou
ple of Sophs was doing likewise at tlie 
adjoining table, when a Plebe walks in 
with sort of a haughty look, felt hat,
and green necktie with brown spots 
on it.
I didnt like his looks, air, or any
thing else, so to set him down a peg, 
I says, Give mo a match, Plebe sort

One Who Never Turned His Back
NP the Carnegie Tartan gocn l;o press, we learn Aviththe deepest sorrow and regret oJ! the death ol! ex-.President Woodrow Wilson. The passing 5:11 our late leader is 
casting a shroud oJ! gloom over our country comparable 
only to that which enveloped the North, and I lie South 
alike, when the assassination ol: Abraham .Lincoln was 
announced;
II; is particularly appropriate that we, .as college men 
sand women, should honor the fallen chief. His service as 
president ol! Princeton University and career as an educa
tor arc such as will call Iorth the admiration ol: the ages 
when viewing the annals ol history. * Not only was his 
own scholarship excellent, but. his perpetual interest in 
the progress ol! his Alma Mater and the attainments of 
her sons, young and old nlilco, are a good cxamplo for us, 
when some day we shall bo Alnnini, though less illus
trious.
The record ol! Woodrow Wilsons public servico 
stands unblemished. Not even in the heal; ol! the bitter* 
league fight was ill suggested that he had erred in any 
way, but in that oi! idealism, and, al!t;or all, that is a sin 
which more ol us should come closer to committing than 
wo do, It n especially wholosomo l!or us to view the rec
ord ol our form or commander-in-chief, in these .days, 
when the scandals being uncovered at Washington are 
shaking one's faith in tlio fundamental honesty ol! the 
human race.
It will not I'all to our pardo judge the final histor
ical ranking of Woodrow Wilson as a .Prosidenl; ol! the 
United Btates, That will I'all to the lot of our children 
and our childrens children. Suffice it for us to grieve 
at Hit' death passing of a noble soul. However miporfoet 
his accomplishments, his faith, and his ideals for the good 
ol! humanity form a worthy example, iudeod, for us to 
follow.
It is said that when the ex-President was informed 
that his end was near, he whispered with his lasl. remain
ing strength J am ready. The words typify his spirit. 
III! was ever and always ready.
The words of Browning are called to mind, when one 
thinks ol! the life of Wilson:
One who never turned his back, but marched breast 
forward,.
Never doubted clouds would break,
Never dreamed though rights were worsted, wrong would 
triumph,
He'held we fall to rise,
Arc baffled to fight better,
SLEEP TO WAKE."

Why the Y?
This little ijuestidn has probably 
vexed more than one student and 
we're going to try to prove herein 
the why of the "Y."
In Room 124 just off the Industries 
hallway, wo ilnd a little office and to 
one side' a spacious clubjroom, the 
headquarters of the Carnegie Tech 
Y. M. . A. Behind the desk in the, 
office is an active, pleasant-faced 
mail always ready to 'be of service to 
anyone who needs a helping hand. 
This man Is Mr. DaYib, the executive 
secretary. 
Furthermore the Y 's behind a 
number of activities about the-camp
us. They are activities which do 
not as a rule gain a lot of publicity, 
but nevertheless they are services 
which make tlio life of the students 
more iivablo.
The Senlor-Counsellor Plan, through 
which new students are ^ivon the 
correct idea of their responsibilities 
and privileges, the inter-fraternitv 
Basket Ball Leagues; definite co-op
eration with tho Institute Chapel; 
Dlscuaslon Groups in which students 
rmiy study under competent leaders, 
the vital questions of religion; enter
tainment and personal co-operation 
with foreign studentb in our collego; 
and co-operaion with the local 
churches in helping the student find 
a church home, are a Jew of the 
services that the organization per
form.

HOOT MON!
In view of the considerate "with
drawal of the Hoot Mon from the 
Rook-the-students Contest so closely 
waged by the various eating establish
ments on the campus, why not place 
some sort of a memorial on Che old 
camping grounds.
All in favor please signify their in
tentions by sending a dime to the ed-itor and a suitable memorial will be 
selected. A statue of His Master*. 
Voice properly supplemented by a 
few tender thoughts should not prove 
inappropriate.
Upon this site the Hoot Mon stood,
A vain attack on profiteers 1 
To lower prices if it could,
The Hoot Mon didnt last two years.
In addition to ihese, there are: 
the visitation of the sick in hospitals 
by Y mon, i. e., by students and 
by faculty; weekly swims at Sc henley High School for Carnegie Tech 
Students; entertainment of students 
who remain in the city over the vaca
tions; co-operation with the Student 
Employment Agency and the agen
cies of the Pittsburgh Y. M. . A.: 
stags and entertainments throughout 
the year; delegations to the Silver 
Bay Y. M. C. A. Conference; delega
tions to tin? Student Volunteer Con
vention; club rooms In the Central 
Building and Scobel Hall; and Sun
day afternoon servico in the dormi
tory Y. M. C. A. Chib Room.
To back him up In carrying out 
these activities,, Mr, Davis has the 
Committee and the Student Cabinet, 
tlio former made un of faculty mem
bers and the latter ol tho following 
students: Griggs, I-Ioenniger, Frazier, 
Newman, Gill, Wilson, Schuckor, 
Morn, Simpson, Patton and Bastian.
And to further carry out these vari
ous services, there must be the finan
cial backing which comes largely 
through tho contributing membership 
of the studcaits in the "Y.
FORM CARNEGIE-PITT 
FIRING BATTERY SOON
And so, 'fellow students, tho next 
time you are approaehod to join tho 
"Y," or to aid In some of Its activi
ties dont burden tho other fellow 
with a lot of whys and wherefpfes, 
Juflt nay, Why afire 1 Id bo glad to 
be of service."
The possibility of a collegiate firing 
battery, composed of one-lialf Car
negie and the other half Pitt atudents. 
bus been practically assured. This 
unit known as Battery C. 17Gth F. A. 
which is now at Pitt, under Col. W. I. 
Dunlap, is a part of one of the oldest 
regiments the United States, hav
ing been organized in 1831. The pro
posed plan will serve not only to cre
ate a friendly rivalry in the battery 
but will conform exactly to the new 
code of school relationship and activ
ities.
Each man is required to sign up 
for three years and must attend drill 
once each week for a period of one 
and one-half hours for which he will 
receive regulation pay according to 
rank. He is also required to attend 
the fifteen-day camp, held in the Poc'ono Mountains at Tobyhanna, Pa. No 
region in eastern Pennsylvania has 
greater natural beauty and a wider di
versity of national features than the 
elevated plateau.
The students who join the national 
guard will naturally receive more con
sideration upon graduation, Svhen Re
serve Officers Commissions are given 
by the Unltod States Army. Iivcase 
of an emergency, such as the late war, 
the members of such a battery will 
likewise bo first in line for promo
tions.
Thistle Bills Must be
Paid Prior to Feb. 15
All organizations whose bills re
main unpaid after February 15, will 
not have their pictures and writeups 
included In tho Thistle. All cln^plcs 
in payment of bills should be made 
payable to M. D, Kallfolz, troaBuror, 
and sent to 4807 Bnum boulevard, or
Aiter months of waiting and delay, Carnegie Tech s new gymna
sium will be opened with a game against tliq Pitt Panther, the first 
in several years. This opening is more than the mere dedication of a 
building; it is something more important. Up to this time, every step 
in the development of the school has been with the idea of giving 
better facilities for instruction; every new building, every new piece 
of equipment, every expenditure of money has been made with the 
sole purpose of bettering our educational opportunities,
The school shows the results of this policy today. Carnegie Tech 
ranks with the best schools of its kind in the country. We are proud 
ol its reputation, and justly so. But there was something lacking. 
Men who thought, about the subject, decided that. Carnogie athletics 
Avere not growing in proportion. Football flourished, but the winter 
sports were objects of pity. And why? Lack of proper equipment 
was the answer.
Give us the chance, and we will support, your teams, said the 
students. The idea of a new gym was discussed. Diflleulties arose. 
Carnegie Tech had never spent money before for anything like this. 
The gym was not absolutely essential: at. least; it. wasnt necessary to 
spend so much money upon it when the money could be well spent 
otherwise.
Someone, however, had the breadth of view to see that if Car
negie Tech were to continue to expand, that she must not be narrow, 
every side ol' student; life must be taken care of, physical as well as 
mental. So, although it was a departure from precedent, the new 
gym was started.
Tonight it is finished.
Tonight Carnegie Tech, with the best gym in the state, takes its 
place with the other major institutions in the matter of educational 
equipment.
Tonight we enter a new era in the. history of Carnegie Tech. 
While Our educational standard is, and always shall be. of paramount 
importance, our athletics take to themselves a new importance and 
dignity.
This is the true significance of the opening of tlfc gym; that 
Carnogie Tech assumes a broader outlook; that; from now on the 
development of the man, not his mind alone, is the ideal.
Our opponent; for the opening is Pitt, which is just as it should 
be, No other rival could so honor the occasion. Every student 
should be on hand tonight. There will never be another opening of 
the new gym, and anyhow, the team is going to need lots of moral 
Support to win.
A WORD TO FRESHMEN, THOUGH SOPHS AND JUNIORS 
MAY WELL NOTE
Its an old, old story -as old as the venerable tower topping 
Machinery Hull -is this welcome to an incoming class at Dear Old 
Tech. But, as old as it is, we extend to you a cordial welcome, and 
just as tobacco grows mellow with age, so does this greeting. There 
is the same old ring of sincerity sounding from within too, for we are. 
glad from the very depth of our hearts that youre going to be one of 
us and we hope and pray right along with you that you will remain 
with us for four prosperous years of loyalty to yourself and Car
negie Tech.
And right here, please let us repeatperhaps in a different way 
a few wise words of counsel.
Carnegie is a great college, and #mll grow greater the more you 
put yourself into it;. Nothing has yet existed and grown without co 
operation between all concerned, and at Carnegie we are no different 
from all other things in this respect. We are not a-thing apart.,
Tis said that a girl loves attention. Likewise so docs Carnegie, 
Tech. Perhaps a somewhat unusual comparison, but nevertheless, 
the fact remains that if 1 love a girl, I am going to shower attentions 
upon her, and if she loAres me, she will return. Let us take it for 
granted that Carnegie loves all of her studentsif a concrete thing 
can love, yet, we can not admit that Carnegie is concrete. It is 
pulsing with life and vitality, for Carnegie is not that mass of brick 
and steel thrown together to represent buildings; it is its student 
body, and who can say that this student body does not pulse with 
life, activity, love, feelings and what-not?
So, if you !re to have your fellow-students, who are Carnegie 
Tech, love and respect you, shower attentions upon her. Get in .ac
tivitieshelp us who are ingive us competition for our positions of 
honorfor, just as in business, so is it at Carnegie Teeliit is com
petition which makes us better.
Freshmen, get into the swimget into activitiesbut, do-notnegleet-your-studies, for, if you do, you will not be able to do either.
Remember, the man who starts in an activity when a Freshman 
and sticks it out, usually nine times out of ten, gets,to the top.
To Cy Hoenniger, who made the 
expression Hoot Mon famous in Plaid 
traditions, this column is respectfully 
dedicated, and with the demise of the 
Greeks, alias the Hoot Mon, impend
ing, it is not improper to perpetuate 
the term by these comments.
FOR THE GOOD OF CARNEGIE
Business in the Commons is daily 
increasing and many innovations are 
creeping in. We can remember when' 
the Commons was affectionately (?) 
referred to as the Beanery.
Apparently the new dietitian ap
proves of the unit systemeach por

portions almost approach ultimate 
units. With due credit to Miss Portlock, might we not say that this trans

Potatoes, carrots, mush and meat, 
Each upon a separate plate;
You think you get a lot to eat, 
Depending on your mental state.
| This year marks an epoch in the j 
j history of Carnegie. THE NEW j 
GYMNASIUM WILL OPEN ITS j 
1 DOORS TONIGHT.
! To be sure, the opening is not for- j 
I mal. It is only semi-official even, but j 
i what do we care for formalities? The 
hopes and dreams of students of the j 
j generations that have preceded us | 
j have been for that which we now are j 
about to realize. We are to have a i 
| new gym. In fact, we have a Gym.
All honor to the old structure which j 
i in the years past, have watched the !
I Tartan spirits droop and rise as the 
favor o Dame Fortune shifted now 
I this way, now that. We can not but 
| feel happy however, that those days 
j are now only a part of our history.
; From now on, we will have elbow 
j room when we wish to take a bit of ex 
ercise.
j When I was a Plebe, I took hygiene.
| Not, you understand, due to any true j 
or pretended desire'* on my part, but 
owing to the fact that the all-powerful 
powers said that I should be educated 
in the Science of Hygiene, I went to 
attend lectures. It is a tribute to 
Dr. Esquerre, that he succeeded in 
driving away from my thoughts in 
those lecture hours the fears for the 
coming math quiz, which is just what 
he did. In fact I became rather inter
ested in the subject, but what I re
member particularly is one morning, 
wnen the worthy doctor requested us 
to tell him whether or no,-we would 
take more exercise than we now did 
if we were given proper facilities.
I believe everyone in th class voted 
"Aye.
With the coming of another semes
ter, new schedules will have to be ar
ranged and most of the irregulars will 
try to accumulate the necessary num
ber of units by electing as many pipe 
courses as possible.
Remember that not only Is ' time 
wasted when you are doing nothing 
Ibut also when it might be better em
ployed for doing something else.
Such action an irregular often jus
tifies by the plea that his activities 
are a considerable burden and he can
not carry more work; in fact, this is 
usually the cause of his irregularity. 
A man with a charming personality 
need only make good in one activity 
and he is in almost universal demand. 
The responsibilities he readily shoul
ders for they are honors,1 and before 
long his studies degenerate into a 
mere avocation.
it takes a good man to receive hon
ors but it requires a better man to 
refuse them.
Much advice is doled out yearly 
about the subjugation of activities to 
studies but who is really swayed by 
it?
People dont want advice, they only 
desire a confirmation of their own 
opinion.

Now the opportunities are ours. In 
any event they soon will be. It is up 
to us now to redeem and make good 
such promises, even though they werenot actually made, for I believe every 
man, woman, and welleven the 
profs, gave the impression that all 
the student body here was waiting for 
before starting to develop into race 
of giants and giantesses was that new 
gym.
The trustees did not make a grant 
of .$-100,000 in order that we might 
win a few more basket ball games. 
Nor was the gym made as large as it 
is with a view to crowding as many 
as possible past the turnstile during 
championship events.
That gymnasium was built for the 
students as a body not for any group 
or groups of students. We should 
have more intramural athletics here 
at Carnegie. Now that we have the 
place, it is up to us to find the incli
nation for we have the talent.
EVERY MAN IN SOME LINE OF 
ATHLETICS.
Let that be the watchword of this 
spring and fall. When we have 
reached that goal we have done and 
are doing something GOOD FOR THE 
GOOD OF CARNEGIE.
Yours, For The Good Of Carnegie.

Five special part-time courses in 
home economics and four part-time 
courses in social work will begin this 
week at the Margaret Morrison Car
negie College for Women, at Carnegie 
Tech, as another step in the expan
sion of the Institutes educational 
service.
Although the courses for women in 
home economics constitute an entirely 
new venture, it is reported that large 
numbers enrolled on the two regis
tration days last week, and more are 
expected to register during the com
ing week. Many of the students, it is 
reported, are married and have been 
attracted by the practicability of the 
new courses which include such sub
jects as Problems in Child Feeding, 
Marketing and Meal Planning, Dress
making, Millinery, and Art Dyeing.
The courses are to be given by the 
regular faculty staffs in the Depart
ments of Household Economics, and 
Costume Economics. Each course will 
consist of one exercise a week, for a 
period of from eight to ten wooks, 
either .in morning or afternoon.
1 addition to the new group of 
homo economic classes, a special se
ries of courses will begin this week 
in the Department of Soc'al Work, 
offered especially to social workers. 
Registration in these courses is an
nounced for Monday evening. Febm 
ary -1th at 7:30 p. 111.
Included in this extended service 
by the QSocial Work Department are 
courses yi Sociology, Social Philoso^ 
phy, Case Work Seminar and Recieation.
Captain Lyons, Adjutant of the Mili
tary Department, is offering a silver 
trophy cup this year to the best shot 
in tho Engineer Unit.
The contest is open to members of 
all four classes and is given with the 
idea of stimulating interest in rifle 
markmanship among the students in 
the Engineer Unit; Captain Lyons is 
an officer in the Corps of Engineers 
and firmly believes that engineers 
should bo good shots as well as good 
I road builders.
j The individual scores will be com| puted in the following manner. The 
i scores of each man inade^in practice 
and in matches under the supervision 
| of an officer or non-commissioned offi| cor will be recorded. The two highest 
scores made by each man will be 
j averaged, to eliminate any element of 
i luck, and the man having the highest 
j average will be declared the winner.
: The four positions considered in the 
contest are sitting, standing, kneeling 
and prone.
A new plan has been instituted this 
year by the Military Department 
wliereby it is hoped to improve the 
result of the rifle team in their 
matches with other teams. Each offi
cer in the department will have 
charge of a match, for which the 
coach of the team and arrange for 
practice shooting.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 5. 1924THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
&PLAID ATHLETICS

On the Plaid Screen
E. C. FRAZIER
PLAID CAGERS WILL 
I TEST STRENGTH SOON
TONIGHT
Tonight marks the resumption of basket hall hostilities between the 
quintets of Carnegie and Pitt. Whether this resumption is .a pleasant con
tinuance of relations or not depends almost entirely upon us, the student 
body of Carnegie Tech.This, of all times is the one when we must remember all the Skibo ideals 
of good sportsmanship and fair play. We must give Pitt a welcome as royal 
as the one they grave us last fall, and then we must turn in and make it as 
hot for their basketers as we did their football team.
The only thing that the dope tells us is that Pitt has won more games 
than we have, and that they will enter' the fray a strong favorite. But the 
Plaid has upset the dope so many times that no one is really offering any 
predictions. It is probable that two of the Pitt first-string players will be 
out of the game, due to ineligibility or illness. ' Chase and Flanagan will 
neither one be in the lineup, according to the Pitt authorities.
So far as we can make out, the only Tartans who will not be able to 
play are those who were/ ineligible at mid-semester, or who have been han
dicapped in practice and training by having been quarantined. Well, lets 
get out there and make it another victory over the Blue and Gold.
GOLF PLAYERS, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
The Athletic Council decides to support and back a golf team this year, 
and calls for candidates. Six men sign up and no more. Result, ho golf team. 
If there is really a demand for the sport in school, it must be manifested 
very soon, or the proposition will be abandoned as impractical at the pres
ent time. Now, yes, right now, give your name to Graduate Manager Buddy 
Overend, if you like golf, and will try out for the team.
A CHANCE TO SHOW OUR STUFF
We have already mentioned the fact that the championship of the 
W. P. I. A. L. will be decided on the floor of the new gym. The territory is 
divided into some eight or nine districts, and the winner in each division will 
be entered in the tournament to decide the Western Pennsylvania champion, 
who will then go to Penn State to battle for the state championship.
The playing dates are as follows: March 4; 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 1 and 22.
On each of these days at least two high school teams will be in town look
ing us over. These boys will certainly like the gymnasium.. But if we want 
them to come to Carnegie, we must make them like us. At Penn State, the 
students nearly fall over themselves in their efforts to show the visitors a 
good time. We can establish ourselves high in their estimation by treat
ing them with the utmost consideration while they are here for their partic
ular round of the tournament. The time and trouble -spent in making these 
youngsters comfortable would be an investment well worth our while._______

"The One Cigarette Sold the World Over"
Are Scheduled to Meet Pitt, 
Grove City and Geneva 
This Week
The Plaid baskettfrs will be kept 
busy this week with three big games. 
Tonight they meet the warriors of the 
University of Pittsburgh'in what will 
surety be a lively encounter, and Friday 
night the Grove City aggregation will 
be met on the home floor. Then on 
Saturday night the representatives of 
Geneva College will travel to Pitts
burgh and attempt to beard the 
Scotchman in his den.
The Grove City encounter promises 
to be an interesting affair. The 
Grovers always turn out a team that 
is hard to beat. It will be recalled 
that the Skibos showed some of the 
best basket ball of their history last 
season when they beat Grove City af
ter that quintet had amassed a string 
of about 20 straight victories. As will 
be seen from the Watching Our Op 
ponents list, they have already made 
a good record this season, and will 
probably bring almost the whole 
school with them to root, for another 
victory over the Plaid. Reserved 
seats for this game are oh sale at 
$1.25, and the game is scheduled to 
start at 8 o'clock.
Geneva will be met on Saturday 
night and no reserved seats will be 
sold. General Admission for all out
siders will be $1.00. Student tickets, 
faculty passes, and alumni books will 
admit holders free. Such tickets are 
not good for credit on reserved seats, 
however.
The Westminster Alumni of the 
Pittsburgh district will have a big 
hullabaloo the night of February 21st. 
They are planning to have a big gettogether celebration before the game 
which their Alma Mater plays with 
the Skibos in the latters new gym. 
They have applied for the use of a 
room where they can practice some 
cheering stunts, and are going to have 
a fted in the Carnegie Commons.
Manager Sam Bittner deserves a 
great deal of credit;* for his foresight 
in arranging to have most of the 
games after examinations to be played 
in the new gym. A glance at the 
schedule will show that there are very 
few games to be played on foreign 
courts during the remainder of the
BASKET BALL GAMES WILL BE

with some color of paint. At present 
alinnninum bronze is finding favor 
with Architect Hornbostel, but that 
may not be the color Anally decided 
upon.
An example of the advanced stage 
of some parts of tho building is tho 
mens club room, wliere the stone 
mantelpiece is ready to bo put into 
position. Sanded) Avails and a barelied ceiling, with the fireplace, al
ready give that room a cheerful and 
dignified appearance.
Tho shower rooms are rapidly ap
proaching the traditional form. But 
there is not a locker in sight. And 
no one knows what the order of busi
ness will be when the building starts 
to 'function. All questions will bo 
answered when the administration is
sues rules md regulations.
It is likely that the fioor of the 
mens gymnasium will be unvarnish
ed for tonighlis game. Mr. L. H. Mil
ler, supervisor of equipment, had 
planed to liave a gang of laborers 
do a hasty .swabbing: of the broad ex
panse. But the painters objected) to 
such a trespass on their rights. Even 
the introduction of a spraying ma
chine failed to satisfy them. And 
since there were not enough painters 
to complete the job in such a short 
time the blocks had to remain unnature!.

BASKET BALL DANCE
TO BE HELD IN UNION
There will be a basket ball dance 
in the Carnegie Union after the Pitt 
game tonight, it has boon announced 
by the Office of the Graduate Man 
ager. Owing to tho large numjber of 
outsiders who will undoubtedly be 
present to witness tho clash, it has 
been thought necessary to limit the 
attendance at the dance to students 
of University of Pittsburgh and Car
negie Tech. One person or each cou
ple must show a registration card 
from either school to the doorkeeper 
before they will be admitted to tho 
Union. The price will be $1.25.
PROAMNENT ATHLETES 
IN 1924 PENN RELAYS
Pennsylvanias Thirtieth Annual Re
lay Race Carnival will this year be 
finer than ever. Cambridge Univer
sity, England, has sent word that they 
will be represented. W. R. Bristowe, 
the captain of tho Cambridge team 
wrote that as yet they had not decid
ed on what distance they will choose. 
It is probable) however, that they will 
decide on the two mile distance as 
they have in college, Mountain, ex 
champion half miler of England; and 
Lowe, both of whom have run the half 
mile in 1 minute 55 seconds. It is 
also said that Griffiths who won tho 
British half mile championship last 
July is at Cambridge. Cambridgo 
will compete in one of the medley re
lay championships on Friday, April 
25th, the first day of the meeting. 
This means that their great athlete, 
Abrahams, will accompany the team. 
Abrahams has dono !). 4-5 seconds for 
100 yards, 21 4-5 seconds for the 220 
yards, 45) 3-5 second for the quarter 
and 23 feet 8 3-5 inches for the broad 
jump. He won three events in the 
Cambridge-Oxford, Harvard-Yale meet 
last July and is one of the greatest 
track athletes in tho world. Pennsyl
vania has also invited Eric Liddell, 
of Edinboro University, Scotland, the 
British 100 yards and 220 yards cham
pion to compete at the Carnival. Lid
dell holds the British records for the 
above distance at 9 7-10 seconds and 
21 3-5 seconds respectively. If he ac
cepts, his meeting with the best or 
our college sprinters will be of tho 
keenest interest.
The University of Havana, Cuba; is 
sending up a team t'o tho Carnival. 
Cuba Is not strong in track athlotics 
and they will be put In a class race 
Occidental Collego of the Pad lie 
Slope, has also stated that they will 
have a team in tho quarter, half and 
one mile relay championships. Occi
dental has a very strong squad of 
sprintors and will bo hard to boat In 
those events. Canada will also bo 
represented. Thus with Canada, 
Cuba, England and colleges as far 
west as California represented, half 
of the globe will bo intorosbed in tho 
rosults of Pennsylvania's groat Car
nival. It is probable also that Aus
tralia will send a eollogo tcam.Jlioso 
men being on their way to tho Olym
pic g#mos In Paris next July.
The Carnival will bo of especial Im
portance this year, bocauso of tho 
keen competition for tho Olympic 
team that will reprosont this country 
in Paris this year. The Rolay Car
nival will give tho coTlogo athletes of 
tho entire country a chance to show 
their ability and the results will no 
doubt have a bearing on the ultimate 
decision of the Olympic Committoo in 
choosing the American team.

ROUND TABLE TO MEET
MONDAY. FEBRUARY 11
Saturday morning the Plebo basket 
ball team journeyed to State College i 
and lost to the Penn State Freshles ) 
by the score 55-17. The playing of j 
tho Nittany Cubs, was equal to that 
of many varsity college teams and al- j 
though the Pebes played a good j 
game they were outplayed and out-1 
classed. I-Iorner, former forward on 
the Passaic Wonder team, led in the 
scoring, dropping in seven goals from 
all angles and two free throws. The 
Nittany Cubs have not scrimmaged 
against the varsity due to the fact that 
they would probably boat them.
Lynch at forward, led the scoring 
for the Plebes by dropping in four 
difficult shots. The Plebe team 
showed a decided improvement in 
their floor work and can bo expected 
to give the Pitt Freshles a hard gamo 
on Tuesday night.
Managers of all Carnogie Tech 
teams are requested to note that there 
will boNmother Round Table meeting 
in the oillce of tho Graduate Manager

not especially concerned with ath
letics. That the president made a 
ten-strike in securing Coach Steffen 
cannot be denied. Incidentally, it has 
leaked out that the invitation was ex
tended upon President Bakers. own 
initiation, without any preliminary 
consultation with the Athletic Asso
ciation officers.
The subject of Coach Steffens ad
dress has not yet been announced, as 
he has been given a free rein to talk 
upon any subject he desires. Wallys 
experience in the capacity, of Alder
man and Judge renders him an able 
speaker on many topics. What the 
subject is to be, however, is not im
portant; we all know that Wally is 
as good a speaker as he is a foot
ball coach, and his talk is sure to 
be good.
In addition to Wally, another at
traction will be in the form of the 
Tuskegee Singers, who will render a 
program of plantation melodies, Ne
gro folk songs, and dialect readings. 
These men come from the Tuskegee 
Institute, Alabama, founded by Booker 
T. Washington and are famous 
throughout both the North and the 
South for their dollgtful entertain
ment.

There's only-one thing that keeps 
a college professor's shoulders 
straight and Ills step firm, just one 
chance that keeps him at his work,1 
tliaij Is the chance that sometime, 
somewhere In his class rooms ho 
will find a genius.
Ever so often in tho history of a 
school a person of rare ability Is dincovered a great novelist or psycholog
ist, historian or musician Is payment 
for. years of hard labor.
.Juliette Bartletti is one of those 
rare discoveries. A lltiilo over two 
years ago the Music Department or 
the College of Fine Arts noticed her 
voice. It Is a wonderful lyric sopra
no of groat sweetness and strength.
It appears that Mftas Bartletti stud
ied under her father, who is also a 
singer, before coming to Carnegie. 
She came first to night school work
ing dlurlng tlio day at the Westinghouse.
Her health broke under the strain, 
however, and liwo year ago she gave 
up her 'employment and eroli^l in 
the day school.
] Since then her work has been very 
pleasing. Last year she took the 
leading role in "Eileen," a light opera 
produced byi tho K. of C. Opera Com
pany. During Campus Week she 
sang ono of the songs from the opera 
at tho Carnegie Music Hall, ono of 
the foatures of tho anudnl student 
show.
Instructors think that her voice is 
exceptional and that her progress has 
unlimited scope.

An interesting pageant entitled In
dustrie Armada to Spain was given 
by the Carnegie Drama Department 
at the Westlnghouse Electric and 
Manufacturing Company recently, 
when a largo shipment of electrical 
apparatus was sent to Spain for out
fitting a very- large stool rolling mill 
that has recently been completed 
there.
The Westlnghouse Company wished 
to make tliolr first large shipment to 
Spain into a form of ceremony, de
picting tho shipment as sort of an in
dustrial armada to that country. Act
ing on this suggestion the drama de
partment produced a very novel 
pageant which was staged Just before 
the department of the. loaded train. 
Immediately following the pageant, 
Helen' Clagett, representing the part 
of Queen Electricity, christened the 
shipment as the American Industrial 
Armada to Spain as it slowly pulled 
out of the yards bound for its long 
Journey.
The members of the cast as seen in 
the pageant .were:

Everything is to .be over by 7:15 in 
plenty of time to get everyone in the

opening.
The following record will be of in
terest to students and alumni alike in | 
that it indicate the hearty approval 
given by employers to one of the new 
four-year-courses leading to a degree 
in the College of Industries.
This list of positions obtained by 
the graduating class of the Machin
ery Production Department lor the 
year 1923, is noteworthy for the di
versity of types of ilrmB and for tho 
size of the starting salaries. When 
it is then further appreciated that 
many of these men have made rather 
extraordinary and impressive strides 
during the first six months of their 
employment the record) of the de
partment is all the more striking.
Among these names are those of a 
group of men who were signed by. 
one corporation for a three-year en
gineering apprentice course, open 
heretofore only to graduates of engi
neering courses^- for which the yearly 
salaries promised- were $1,200.-00, 
$1,50,0.00, .$1,800.00 respectively. After 
two months experience with the firm, 
the corporation jumped these men a 
whole year in their salaries and train
ing, thus demonstrating the practical 
value of the four-year's shop train
ing background given at 'Carnegie. At 
the end of the first six months sev
eral of the men have been raised to 
the $1,800.00 rate which they bad ex
pected at the end of two years.

Undoubtedly many of the other 
even have nroaressed rapidly in botb 
salaries and positions, but we have 
jo actual knowledge of these promoIn a recent issue of Scribner's Mag
azine', Mr. Wm. Lyons Phelps delivers 
himself of the following statement:
When I was a Freshman at Yale, 
I remember a literary decision handed 
down one day from the professor's 
desk, and I not o^ily remember it, but 
remember the speakers facial expres
sion, and the tone of his voice. While 
I am under no illusion as to profes
sorial influence on students, there is 
one commonly heard statement that 
I KNOW TO BE FALSE. (Namely) 
Nobody remembers what he was 
taught in the classroom. The speak
er then generally proceeds to empha
size the strikingly original thought 
that what students learn at college 
they learn from one another. Now, 
while I was and am devoted to my 
classmates, I learned more from my 
teachers; and so far from having for
gotten everything they said, I can re
member all sorts of obiter dicta, ver
batim et literatim. If the faculty say
ings vanish on their utterance, why is 
it that at class reunions, bald and fat 
alumni talk so much and so often 
about the hours in the class room, 
and what the Prof did on such and 
such an occasion. Perhaps no per
son is remembered longer than the 
teacher. Some are hated, some are 
despised, some are ridiculed and pa
rodied, BUT FEW ARE FORGOT
TEN.
It would be of interest to the under
graduates of Carnegie to know if our 
Alumni feel in a similar way about 
these matters. Is the writer right or 
is he wrong? SPEAK UP.

OLD GRADS WILL SEE 
FIRST GAME IN GYM
Are you going to see your old class
mates there? Sure! All Alumni, who 
possibly can, will be on hand to see 
the first basket ball game to be played 
in the new gymnasium.
Tho opening of the new gym will 
be the realization of fond dreams of 
your own college days.
Remember, when you used to hear 
reports that the Carnegie Foundation 
was planning to set aside a sum of 
money to erect a gymnasium. Then 
came such news as a new site. must 
be chosen, plans must be altered, and 
many similar reports. Well, it seems 
that those preliminary delays are nec
essary when big projects are put over.
Now these are all over and the 
dream of many Techites is being real' 
izod, The floor is finished, the seats 
are in place, and the team; well, you 
can see for yourself when you come 
out with tho crowd tonight,
All* available reserved seats have 
been disposed of and the general ad
mission is going fast. A record crowd 
is expected.

FEIN AND KLEIN
DISCUSS THE ENFORCEMENT 
OF PLEBE REGULATIONS
(Continued From Page One.) 
so hard after my Physics exam, when 
lie passes the Senior Fence, that he 
got scared and took off Ills hat, Id of 
clean forgotten that there was such a 
rule to that effect!
"Well, yo.ui cant blame the Plebe 
for that, Max, I butts -in, if you 
don't enforce the rules they wont live 
up to them and, moreover, they fell 
kind of foolish keeping rules when no
body tries to make them. If you see 
a Plebe conscientiously living up to 
the rules, you take such a superior at
titude and try to impress him that he 
is a darned fool in doing so and that 
if he had any guts at all lie would 
break it right off. And whats more, 
would yc-u pledge a Plebe to your frat 
if you thought lie would buckle down 
under regulations, be a perfect good 
little boy, and never try to raise Cain 
at all? Of course not.
I see your point, Fein, theres not 
any doubting that, but just as the 
Plebes are there to break regulations, 
the Sophs are there to enforce them 
which they got to do if regulations 
are going to be any good. When the 
Plebes come here Doc Baker makes 
them welcome, Dean Mott tells them 
. to study if they dont want to get 
kicked out, and Tarbell tells them to 
pay all bills to A. N. I-Ieyl promptly 
or get likewise. After this true ad
vice or warning which they dont 
usually take, the President of "the 
Student Council, or whoever else is 
not a week late for registration, ex
plains Plebe regulations to them and 
says theyre for their own good, just 
like' discipline in the army. The 
Plebes take it all in and spend the 
rest, of the day putting up bleachers 
and yelling Tech, which aim right 
because It should be Carnegie.
"For two weeks tho.Plebes soak up 
discipline, and then .the Sophs get 
tired of acting like policemen, and the 
Plebes pull the Russia stunt, not so 
suddenly but just the same. At the 
next Soph assembly everybody de
cides that somethings got to bo done 
about it and ;it one-thirty the Plebes 
are razzed. The next day tho Com
mercial Sophs hold a Plebe inspec
tion and then everybody forgets 
about it.
The Alumni will welcome the news 
pertaining to the trip of the Carnegie 
Musical Clubs through Ohio, for it is 
the big chance for them to get back 
some of that Carnegie spirit. Cer
tain clans have organized, and find 
this means a fit way to express their 
love for the Alma Mater. Certain 
other groups are organizing a Clan, 
and the Glee Club concert will aid 
both financially and spiritually, so to 
speak, in this adventure for the 
Glory of Carnegie!
Trips are planned ahead of time by 
the industrious managers, and this 
time concerts have been arranged for 
in five Ohio cities. The first stop will 
be Orrville, on Wednesday, February 
20, when the Glee Club will sing at 
the High School, as it has for the past 
few season. The men in the clubs are 
glad to get back to Orrville again, for 
the treatment they receive by the pat
rons there is unusually good.
In Akron the club will sing for the' 
Saint Vincents Alumni. There lias 
been no concert in Akron by our clubs 
since 1922, when the clubs sang for 
the same organization. No one in the 
clubs at that time could say enough 
about the splendid time they had in 
Akron, and aside from the fact that 
the Assistant Managerthe present 
onegot lost in the woods, the con
cert was a success.
Cleveland will be the next stop, and 
the concert will be given at the Pres
byterian church at 79th and Euclid. 
The concerts in Cleveland have be
come a regular thing on the program 
of the clubs.
An additional concert will be given 
in Youngstown for the Masonic Hall, 
and this will be a splendid affair, ac
cording to the dope received by the 
authorities. The members of the 
clubs have not been told all about this 
concert, for there would be too much 
fighting for places if they knew 
everything.
A concert in Canton will fill the 
program for this trip, and this will 
be an innovation for the clubs. There 
has been no concert there within the 
memory of the present staff, and that 
means new fields to conquer. The 
clubs always do better in new fields, 
as was shown by the concert in North 
East.
The trip promises to. be a great one, 
and the Alumni are urged to come out 
en masse for the concerts. There 
will be several novelty numbers for 
this trip, and a number especially for 
the old grads.

Mining Prof. Speaks

Education Furnishes Mental 
LubricantV irgin
There used to be a lot of excite
ment when the Sophs ran off with the 
Plebe president for their banquet and 
when the Plebes tried to do likewise, 
And when ttye Sophs got peeved after 
finding the Plebes in their banquet 
hall, they paddled all the Plebes in 
the dorms with street car straps for 
which the class had to pay afterwards, 
and then the Plebes sent up a ldtei 
and the Soplis squirted them with a 
fire hose.
So the faculty gets together and 
says We got to cut out these PlebeSopli banquets or well get too much 
undesirable publicity and we mustnt 
have any more fights for the school 
may catch on fire and there, wont be 
no fire hose, or someone might get 
drowned in the tank. But we mustnt 
cut out these here Plebe regulations 
for theyre traditions and we got to 
have traditions. So we got traditions 
and spirit and all* the other trim
mings, when the bands playing and 
, there are six cheer-leaders climbing 
I telephone poles, etc.', and half the 
I Senior class, which is mostly on half 
| a dozen committees or -so and has a 
i lot of spirit, is yelling their heads off.
"Traditions are great things when 
you live up to them, regulations are 
fine when they are enforced, spirit is 
what makes a college, but if a few 
fellows have got to howl and band
it is not generally appreciated by 
alumni of this institution that we 
have here a goodly number of promi
nent men upon our faculty, who are 
greatly in demand for their views up
on various subjects.
One of these is Professor Virgin of 
the Mining Department, College of 
Engineering. Professor Virgin spoke 
before the members of the Coal Min
ing Institute at Johnstown a short 
while back. His utterances on that 
occasion have received wide public
ity. Some of these we are reprinting 
for their intrinsic worth.
Education gives vim, vigor, and vi
tality to industry, and that is essen
tial to keep the wheels of industry 
moving.
The hospitality of working people 
to labor-saving machinery is borne of 
the idea that it will displace the 
working man. It is true that it does 
at time turn out several times the 
product formerly turned out by the 
man but the workman is not exerting 
so much muscular power.
Fortified with education a man 
brings into play his creative ability. 
He is fortified with a power that en
ables him to do his work mre easily, 
and he possesses the education lubri
cant as an enemy to mental friction?
The movement on foot of substi
tuting or at least crediting a com
pleted College course in coal mining 
with two or three years of required 
experience is pernicious. The adop
tion of such a measure would be sim
ply a forerunner of similar meddle
some legislation.
Aiumni Recognition Pin 
Will be Ready by June
A large number of recognition pir 
designs have been submitted for con 
sideration from students, alumni, ano 
competing companies. Many of these 
designs are of an exquisite pattern in 
laid with the colors of the Plaid and 
a Carnegie feature. With such a large; 
number of designs from which to se.; 
lect, Carnegie men and women should 
have an- .appropriate and distinctive 
pin.
The judgment will be held soon and 
after the selection has been made, 
Mr. Tillbrook promises to rush the 
pins through and if possible pins for 
the alumni will be available by June. 
Plans are being laid to get the pins 
in large quantities and distribute 
them through the alumni office. The
