.... .....-------------------------------------------------- .1 : ;>/,CLAN BANQUET 
DATE SHIFTED 
TO DECEMBER 8
Joint Meeting With Gridders 
and Harriers as Guests is 
PlanMany Notables Will 
Serve as Speakere
REMEMBER THE DATE
The Varsity Clan Banquet of the 
past will be replaced ' this year by a 
joint meeting to be held under the 
auspices of the Pittsburgh Clan, in 
the honor of the teams of the past 
season, upon Saturday, December S.
Although the domicile which wilT 
house the banquet has not yet been 
-definately selected, either the Wil
liam Penn or the Fort Pitt will dis
pense the victuals since only these 
have dining halls of sufficient ca
pacity to adequately accommodate 
the multitude that this affair will at
tract.
The Varsity and Plebe football 
squads and the Cross-country team 
will also be present, not as perform
ers, for do not their past perform
ances suffice, but as guests of honor; 
nor shall they appear in football 
togs for they) are mostly Greeks who 
have conquered the boiled shirt and 
cut a mean figure in cits.
To avoid possible overcrowding, 
the- sale of tickets will be restricted 
to five hundred, which are now 
available at the Alumni Bureau, but 
we advise all prospective buyers to 
postpone their purchases until the 
last moment and thus avoid the dan
ger of losing their tickets to say 
nothing of furnishing the naturally 
ambitious committee with additional 
work.
The banquet is the biggest func
tion on the athletic calender and 
one of the few occasions at which 
alumni can really meet, exchange 
confidences with acquaintances of 
former years, rediscover tlfe Carnegie 
spirit of the present day, and once 
. more experience the thrill of being 
one of a jubilant throng, activated by 
a common purpose, stimiulated by the 
same hopes, where all hearts beat as

All Out For First Bon Fire
Everybody at Carnegie should hold 
open their dates or postpone any 
they have made for tomorrow even
ing, Wednesday, at 7:30 p. m. The 
first bonfire of the season iB going 
to be pulled off on the football field 
back of the Field House. It is go
ing to be a big affair on account of 
its tradition. Them is no necessity 
to send out special engraved invita
tions to the upper-classmen to turn 
out, because they all know the signi
ficance of a Carnegie bonfire, and 
will enter into the true spirit ofit.
A lot of help will be needed in 
preparation. for the affair. Plebes 
are supposed to make their physical
form prominent on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons, to carry wood and 
do general work for the Sophomores.
The Plebes are urged to. enter in
to the proper spirit of contributing 
their muscular energy toward making 
the occasion a successno shirking 
from the jobs assigned. Any work 
that is traditional to the Alma Mater, 
should bo performed iu a willing 
manner. The Sophomores will be on 
deck to assign the Plebes to thoir 
respective jobfe.
This bonfire will be more sensa
tional than any of those of the past. 
Seven-thirty is a good time of the 
day because one can still keep his 
nine o'clock date for that night; 
what is better, can bring her along.
TECH JOURNAL TO 
COME OUT THURS.
Junior Banquet Plans 
Are About Completed
Prelim Tickets Now on Sale 
for Event at Schenley
Issue Will Describe Several 
New a nd Interesting 
Subjects
At last, after weeks of compilation, 
correction and revision, the new Car
negie Technical Journal is ready for 
publication and will appear on the 
campus Thursday with an issue 
which bids fair to rival the muchheralded Shilling.
Perhaps the outstanding features 
of the Journal is the excellence of 
the articles which it contains. Of par
ticular interest is a description of a 
mercury boiler and turbine unit in 
which mercury replaces water, now 
being installed by the General Elec
tric Company in their Hartford plant.
Two other articles of unusual value 
discuss phenol condensaition products 
and a new high reduction gear in 
which both sharts are on a line, the 
former being furnished by E. S. Cnsselman of the Mellon Institute, and 
tho latter by G. S. Morrison, the in
ventor of the gear.
A. S. Carter of the Carnegie Chem
ists Club, has graciously furnished 
a unique exposition of interesting 
fallacies of science, and J. F. Lamb 
expounds the elimination of cross-talk 
in telephone circuits. Messrs Rittjnan and Bright demonstrate the 
flunking of undergrads by a series 
of graphs, and reveal statistics to 
corroborate them.
The Journal has been redesigned; 
a new cover has ben adopte'd, and 
a title page added. The issue Is well

C.M.E.S. Outlines Plans 
At First Meeting of Year
Last Tuesday, the Carnegie Mechan
ical Engineering Society held its first 
meeting of the year. The obj.ect of 
the meeting was to get the organiza
tion going and to give' the members 
a general idea of the plans for this 
year.
Professor Ely explained the organi
zation of the American Society of Me
chanical Engineers, to what extent the
C.-M. E. S. is affiliated with it, and 
the benefits which are derived from 
membership in each of the two or
ganizations.
The honorary chairman of the C. M.
E. S'., Professor W. Trinks, gave the 
members many good ideas, which, 
when put into practice, will improve 
the organization and stimulate a 
greater interest in it this year.

mechanicals should attend tjie next 
meeting of the C. M. E. S. which will 
be held November 27. It is 'assured

FIELD ARTILLERY NEEDS
THIRTY-THREE MORE MEN
The 107tli Field Artillery, which is 
being formed exclusively of Carnegie 
men, now has an enrollment of 
eighteen. A total of fifty-one VO 
needed to make the battery1. Mr. A.
H. Anderson, who will be lieutenant, 
is preparing for an examination for 
a commission in the artillery. He 1L 
now a second lieutenant in the Mo
tor Transport Corps. Any men w'ho 
are interested in joining this organ
ization may learn particulars from 
the Military Department.
The music students in the Arts Col
lege/ recently had the pleasure of en
tertaining some of the distinguished 
musicians who have been giving con
certs in Pittsburgh this season. Willy 
Burmester, Mrs. Burmester, and Mr. 
Rupp, accompanist, made an inspec
tion tour of the College of Fine Arts 
and met the students of the Depart
ment of Music informally at that time. 
The department also received a visit 
from eight of the members of the 
Wagnerian Opera Company which was 
playing in Pittsburgh at that time.
The visitors were very much im
pressed by what they saw at Car
negie. Mr. Burmester was especially 
delighted with the work the Music De
partment is doing, but above all with 
the splendid equipment and teaching 
facilities of the department.
Girls! Pay Your Dues 
For the Junior Prom
Your Support is Necessary to 
Maintain M. M. Traditions
Since it was definitely voted by the 
girl to keep their Junior prom sepa
rate from the Mens Junior Prom, 
there has been a great deal of satis
faction expressed at Margaret Morri
son. Nearly every girl was working 
for the preservation of this treas
ured tradition of the girls Junior 
class In the Margaret Morrison Car
negie College.
The social chairman, Berenice 
Rentz and her assistants are mooting 
each week to further the plans for 
the orchestra, favors and all the 
things necessary for such an import
ant social event. Esther Johnson and 
Ida Flnkel are vory enthusiastic ovor 
the mens favors which they chose 
last week. They still have tho wo
men's favors under consideration.
Heavy oxpense is always involved 
with a Prom, and for this reason, 
the financial officers of the class beg 
the girls to pay up their back duos 
and to pay tho three dollars towards 
the Prom before November 27. By 
doing this they will not only lesson 
the burden of paying for the Prom In 
January, but they will also put money 
into the class treasury which can sim
plify matters for the committees.

Dont let anyone miss this last 
football dance of the season. Its go
ing to be the best yet for wete go

First of Three Talks

Attendance Disperses Idea of 
Lack of Interest
Tho accusation Is orton made 
against students in technical schools, 
that they bocomo narrow duo to tho 
limited intorosts of thoir courso of 
study.
Tho attondanco at Dr. Ersklno's lec

argument. A much largor crowd at
tended than had at first boon oxpoctod, although tho roquosts for tlckots 
had been ratlior largo.
Dr. Ersklno Is a graduate of Co

teacher of English at. Amherst and at 
Columbia, returning to his Alma Mutor In 1909. Our noted guost is tho 
author of largo numbor of notable 
books, essays, and artlclos. Ho is a 
member of tho Loglon of Honor of 
Franco, being a chovallor In that fa

Franco, has made him an honorary

Seniors Hair-Nou) Has Silken Locks to Spare
(By Don Gardner.)
When last week came in with a 
bang, bringing the first elusive 
evanescent harbingers of winter with j 
it, we merely began to inspect our 
room mates stock of heavies and to | 
sleep longer and more heartily i 
through the abomination known to 
mankind as the 8:30 Reports 
throughout the campus failed to bring i 
to light any more serious consldora-1 
tions of tho impending cataclysmic] 
snow fall and everything seemed to! 
be at peace with the world. Idiotic! 
Freshmen and unsophisticated Soph-! 
dinores continued the asinine (|uery 
as to whether the degree of frigidity | 
was sufficient to assuage our most| 
rabid anticipations and the coming! 
winter was regarded with the same! 
disdain and sang froid that one con- j 
templates the five quizzes booked for 
tomorrow morning. And bo it should 
be.
Then it came to our ears that one 
of the most celebrated and best
known Seniors was in dire and Im
mediate 'danger of succumbing to the 
ravages of the undue temperature 
depression merely because his late 
investments in Belgian Hair Tonic 
had failed to bring forth fruit. Here 
we were, an entire college with our 
lights on for the winter, and one 
of us shivering ' on the outside 
through no fault of his own. Can wo 
blame a man if his hirsute adorn
ment was neglected whon permanent 
cranium covers were distributed? 
.Can we expose him, to tho public 
eye and say Lo, here 1 a man who 
is bald, gaze on hi polished pate! 
and ' take heed therefrom, lent you, 
too, be mistaken for a proof? No, 
obvIouBly no, ye!-. something must be 
done to provide our follow man with 
some means whereto to attach his 
ear muffs. A committee was ap
pointed and will report In time for 
next years side show but In tho

co-workers have not been Idle.
It is rumored that in the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College for Wom
en a silent period, imrA)rfil)le though 
it may seem, has been declared and 
every day these devout followers of 
our bereaved Senior gather in solemn 
conclave to exhort those In authority 
to return our heros hair. And won
ders have been accomplished. Yes

You can take lots of care

Opinions differed. Some thought 
smoking should be allowed; others 
thought that it should be prohibited 
both on the campus and In the

Big Crowd

The Notre Dame gamo Is almost 
hero, and with it, tho close of our 
football season. Wevo had one of the 
best that wove ever had, and wo can 
truthfully say that tho game next Sat
urday winds up a successful football 
year.
Tho game next Saturday is by far 
the hardest game of the season and 
ono of tho most Important. Even No
tre Damo realizes that this game is 
of more than usual Interest. The stu
dent body of Notre Dame Is allowed 
to attend one game on foreign ground 
during each season, and thoy have se
lected tho Carnegie game as the one 
to s6o this season.
Already Buddy Ovorond has sent 
ono thousand reserved seats to South 
Bond and thoy have askod him to send 
them from five hundred to a thousand 
moro. With the local seat sale going 
as It Js, there is every possibility that 
tho crowd will bo tho greatost of the 
yoar at Forbes Field.
VVlion the final whistle blows Satur

ALUMNI HOMECOMING DAY
Talking to a man afew day ago who told me something like
this:
Over at Carnegie Tech they remind me of a family of newlyrieh in tho way they try to start traditions. A ncwly-rich family 
buys up all kinds of stuff without regard to its propriety just to 
show that it is rich, and tries to overcome tho handicap of lack of 
ancestors by trotting out a lot of old furniture and things like that. 
Over at Carnegie, they try to make up for the fact that it is a new 
school by building up traditions in u few years which usually take 
generations in other schools. If they must manulacture traditions, 
why not base them on some custom which has become firmly estab
lished through long usage?"
Without arguing as to the truth of his ideas, we must admit that 
it is better to build traditions on something which is firmly estab
lished than on something all togothcr new.
There is one thing of which wo foci keenly the need, in regard 
to Carnegie, and that is some day which will bo set aside annually 
as a Homecoming Day for Carnegie Alumni. 01! course wo have 
Campus Week in tho spring, but wo need anothor day, preferably in 
the fall, when the grads can comc back and soe how things arc 
around school. Of spccial value is the interest which would be 
worked up at this timo through tho modium of tho football team. 
Thore is nothing in tho world which arouses more interest in tho 
Alma Mater than tho sight of that Scarlet Team out thore fighting 
for tho name of tho school. So much for tho need.
The game which eausos most ntqrost in tho schools, and in the 
city of Pittsburgh gonorally is, without a doubt, tho game with Pitt, 
Thore is no game on tho schedule which wo would rath or win than 
tho one with our rivals aorons tho hollow. And this spirit is em
bodied more firmly, if possiblo, in tho Alumni than in tho under
graduate body for tho reason that at tho timo thoy graduatod, wo 
wore mooting Pitt in all branohos of athlotios.
II, is practically certain that tho nowly rosumod rolations will bo 
oontinuod and will extend into ovory branch ol! athlotios. Tho foot
ball (came will continue to grow in importauco; its wo havo proved 
thali Carnegie at last ratos with tho Panther when it oomos to tho 
groat Tall sport, So much for the established custom.
Now if wo arc to havo an Alumni Homecoming Day in tho fall, 
what is more logical than to havo it on tho day ol! tho OarnogiorPitl. 
gamef Most of tho alumni will oomo back anyhow, and by exerting 
a little effort, wo could havo ovory alumni within a radius of five hun
dred miles of Pittsburgh hero. A program could bo arranged very 
easily which would appeal to both tho students and tho grads, and it 
would be one of tho biggest oocasions of tho year. It would send the 
Alumni homo with a groator pitch of enthusiasm, and would help a 
groat deal in getting them all back for Campus Week.
We think that the idea is well worth trying, and it could be 
developed into a tradition which would bo a tradition, based on 
established custom, and existing from the natural advantages which 
would accompany it.

Series of Colored Photos of 
Extinct Indian Tribes on 
Exhibition
Carnegie Tech cheering at football 
games is often commented upon by 
newspapers, but there exists a no
ticeable dofect, in that co-ordination 
Is conspicuous by its absence. We be
lieve tho remedy lies in cutting down 
the number of cheer-leadors from 
about seven to tlireo. Pitt, with a 
larger student body than ours haB but 
throe cheer leaders and gets good co
ordination in tholr cheoring.
A little advertising goes a long way, 
but there Is a minimum, below which 
this rule does not hold. To our mind, 
the Lehigh game was greatly underadvertised and tho small crowd was 
evidence of this. It pays to adver
tise!
While on that subject, bear in mind 
that it in mainly by means of funds 
dorlvwd from advertising that this 
weekly paper can be printed. There
fore, Patronize Our Advertisers."
We are beginning to suspect tho 
existence of a secret treaty of peace 
between the Sophs and Plebes. If it 
has come to that, then where, oh 
where, are tho good old dayB? The 
Sophomores have fallen down com
pletely in their duty toward the 
PlebeB and are deserving of a gen
uine razzing.
It is rumored that the girls are very 
Btrongly opposed to the idea of a joint 
Junior Prom. Upon thinking it over, 
it seems that they are justified in 
their oppoBition. How about it?
Are things around Carnegie run the 
way you would like to have them 
run?. Are you satisfied that there is 
no room for improvement anywhere? 
If not, what is wrong and what can 
you suggest? Dont forget, we print 
anything thats fit to print, so write 
us a note containing your ideas about 
the way you think something''should 
be done.
This old wheeze struck us funnily: 
Is pants a singular or plural 
noun?
Both. Its singular at the top and 
plural at the bottom."
Carnegie Students 
Receive Scholarships
Twenty-One Night School 
I Men Receive Awards
Twenty-one scholarships were 
awarded this year to night school 
students at Carnegie. According to 
an announcement by Dr. Baker, a 
similar number of scholarships wlil 
horoaftor bo awarded each yonr, as 
a result of tho action of tho Board 
of Trustees last June.
This Is the first yoar that these 
sohohfrBhiptt, valued at $80 each, 
havo boon awarded. Tlioso who re 
ctivo them must have completed at 
least -ono years work In a- night

The attention of Carnegie students 
la called to tho Exhibition of Indian 
photographs, taken by Walter McClintock, which are being shown at the 
Carnegie Institute until November 25. 
This exhibition is considered to bo one 
of the most Interesting of the season 
at tho Institute, and is well worth the 
time of anyone to visit it.
The exhibition containing 308 pho
tographs beautifully colored, takes on 
special interest in tho fact that Mr. 
McClIntock is a native Pittsburgher. 
The photos were taken by him over a 
period of fifteen years, during which 
he lived with the members of the 
Blackfoot tribe, an experience that 
culminated In his adoption by the 
Blackfoots as a member of their tribe.
The exhibition has unusual value 
and Interest from the fact that the 
entire generation of Indians of that 
tribe has ceased to exist in their na
tive form. Today their children are 
civilized and educated and no longer 
take part in their ancient customs 
and worship. Tho opportunity to re
view pictures of a primitive life that 
has vanished, is inducement enough 
to give the display the once over.
PLANS UNDER WAY FOR
NIGHT SCHOOL SMOKER
Classes A, B, C, D, E, and the Ra
dio class of the Electrical Construc
tion course in Night School are plan
ning to hold a smoker some timo in 
December. A committee, made up of 
two men elected from each of the 
classes mentioned, is hard at work on 
the details of the affair. While not 
yet ready to discuss tentative plans, 
the men in charge say that the func
tion will be in every way equal to 
anything that the men in any of the 
day courses are capable of putting on.
ASSEMBLIES
The best assembly of the year is 
promised for Science men today in 
Room 218. Besides the usual an
nouncements there will be the selec
tion of men for the Tau Beta Pi, the 
honorary scholastic engineering fra
ternity, th announcement of the 
hlgli students of last years Plebe 
and Sophomore classes, and certain 
renditions by tho Glee Club. As an 
added attraction, the newly organ
ized Plebe Orchestra will make its 
first public appearance.
The feature of the assembly is to 
be tho pledging of now men by the 
honorary scholastic fraternity, Tau 
Beta Pi. Candidates for Tau Beta 
PI at this time will be chosen from 
among the.upper quarter of the Sen
ior class ii>nd tlio highest Junior in 
the College of Engineering. At the 
same Urne the ranking men of the 
lower classes will be announced.
Solectlons aro also scheduled by a 
strictly Plebe orchestra, which, de
spite its newness, should be a wolconio addition to tho assembly program,
A sustained effort will be made to 
Daimillarizo the student body with tho 
now tune of the "Alma fttfater. Al
though far from a new project, the 
tu.no is still compartlyoly unfamiliar, 
and it is hoped that a rendition by 
the Gloe Club will go far toward In
creasing its popularity.

FOR THE GOOD OF CARNEGIE
It has become the custom of foot
ball writers to make the end of the 
football season the occasion for an 
eulogy to that specimen of humanity 
variously known, as the scrub, the 
reserve, and similar appellations. 
The custom is rather reminiscent of 
our praise of the dead. After it is 
all over, we seem to reflect and see 
what was plainly evident all the
time.
Most of us hajve been at football 
games where some team waa hope
lessly outplayed and seemed to lose 
heart. It was treatment to which 
they were little accustomed. We are 
not speaking of the Carnegie varsity, 
of course, just varsity teams in gen
eral. And how about the rooters? 
Did they rally in the face of odds?
Then consider the life of the scrub. 
At all gam/as of import he 1L assign
ed to guard the bench. If by chance 
a varsity player is disabled, the
coach shrugs his shoulders when he 
sendB in his scrub, as much as to 
say: "Well, we have to have some
body in there, but its too bad I 
have to use you.
On the practice field he is contin
ually) pitted against a team that is 
superior in weight and speed and 
w'hich has the adVice of a varsity
coach who knows all the plays the
scrubs might employ. If a scrub is 
laid out, does he get a cheer? Hie 
does not Does he get ai long write
up in the morning papers? He does 
not. Yet, who doubts that a broken 
leg is just as painful on the practice 
field as on the field of actual com
bat?
In the classroom, the lot of the 
scrub is not to be envied either. 
Generally his classmates a.re una
ware, that he plays, or If they do 
know, more or less good-natured jibes 
are continually shot at him The
professors, too, are often rabid en
thusiasts, and will arrange to be 
wearing smoked glasses when the 
star makes some small error in a 
problem No such goor fortune for 
the scrub, however. He must keep 
up in his classwork with the rest of 
us, often without the help of fellowstudenls as tutors as some men 
have.
Well, then, since he is thus put at 
a disadvantage, why does he stick 
with it? Probably each man has his 
own personal reasons. There isbenefit to be derived from the ex

[| Power of Attack in 40-0 
Victory 
------------------
lowing a power of attack and 
diness of defense that would have 
d credit to many college elevens, 
Bellefonte Academy team disjd of the Carnegie Tech Plebea 
bandy fashion last, Friday aftert. When the final whistle blew, 
prep school lads were rejoicing 
i 40 to 0 victory, 
be day was a murky one, just 
kind of weather that takes the 
it out of a contest. A slight contal rain and a dense fog were all 
were necessary to dampen the 
>r of the few hardy fans who 
e out to see the battle. It was 
l difficult at times to follow the 
jress of the ball, 
he visiting team looked like a 
aer the moment they trotted out 
the field. They were big, so big 
one might have supposed that 
were going to play the varsity 
ead of the yearling eleven. And 
play they bore out the impreaproduced by their size. They 
5ted of almost incredible power 
a prep school team, and had 
led the first touchdown over the 1 >o goal line almost before the 
e had gotten under way.
Canadian by the name of Con>r was the Bellefonte ace when 
ame to line thrusts. It seemed 
he could not be stopped. He 
ied the ball over for two of his 
ls touchdowns. Buck ONeil and 
other backs were also powers on 
attack.
nt get the idea that the Plebes 
e just standing by and watching 
enemy carry the ball down the 
though. They pulled some
!l playing themselves, but were 
light to pack the final punch 
issary to score. Twice, Hamilcarried the ball almost to scor 
distance, but the lighter Plebes 
d not overcome the heavy prep 
and wore somewhat handicapby the muddy condition of the 
Bu they fought, all the way 
ugh, and their defeat cannot be 
d disgrace. The lineup:

VARSITY MEN GET 
GOLD FOOTBALLS
CIVILS VICTORIOUS
Redoubtable Commercial Line 
is Re-doubted
(By Gum)
The Senior Civils reign supreme in 
departmental football as a result of 
the game scheduled for 10 oclock last 
Saturday morning on the old Shadyside Academy field. The Senior Com
mercials well earned the 0 they re
ceived by showing nothing and doing 
nothing.
Amid the deafening applause of 
Coach Stanton and the water boy the 
Civils first took the field. Up and 
down the gridiron they raced as they 
put through a snappy signal drill. 
Soon after Head Line Coach Rittman 
appeared on the ground to guide his 
proteges to victoryor defeat. 
Promptly at ten the officials arrived.
Capt. Clement of the Civils won the 
toss and chose to re6eive. There Was 
a scurry of feet as the coaches and 
spectators rush to points of vantage 
and safety. The fighting Civils 
rushed to their positions. Whistle to 
mouth the referee called, Are you 
ready, Capt. Clement? Aye, aye. 
sir. Ready and waiting. Are you 
ready, Capt. Griggs? No answer. 
Are you ready, Commercials? Dole
fully was the question wafted . back 
from the ivy-clad walls of old Shadyside. Where was that far famed and 
endless Commercial line and staff?
(Let us digress for a moment. Sci
ence tells us that that which has no 
end likewise has no start.) T was 
true. Every member of the Commer
cial squad -was absent and unaccount
ed for. Dejectedly their coach cast 
the trainers towel out onto the mud 
covered field in token ofBut hold, 
a thot; mud, no Commercials. Maybe 
it was a coincidence.

Decrees Athletic Council at 
Recent Meeting Squad 
to Have Dinner
That the varsity letter mon on the 
football squad will roceive gold foot
balls as a slight token of their great 
work during the season just drawing 
to a close, was decidod at the last 
meeting of the Athletic Council, held 
Wednesday night, November 14.
Some agitation for such a move
ment was started after the Pitt vic
tory, and it will be gratifying to the 
student body and other followers of 
the Plaid that the Council has appro
priated the necessary funds for this 
purpose.
Money was also appropriated to 
give the two squads, Varsity and 
Freshmen, a combined luncheon on 
December 15, under the auspices of 
the Varsity and Pittsburgh Clans. 
The luncheon will in all probability 
be held at the Fort Pitt Hotel.
Among the other items disposed of 
at the meeting was the decision to 
send two men to the Inter-Collegiate 
Cross Country meet in New York. It 
was also decided to elect a vice presi
dent for the body at the next meet
ing. This official will be elected from 
within the council and the election 
will not involve adding another man 
to the council.
The football situation for the com
ing year was also talked over. The 
schedule was discussed at some 
length, as was the coaching system. 
A committee was appointed to confer 
with Head Coach Steffen as to the 
best permanent arrangement that can 
be effected for the future.
COLLEGIATE IMPS WISH
TO MAINTAIN INTEGRITY
It has been rumored about the 
campus that the Carnegie Collegians 
have taken the place of the Collegi
ate Imps. This is not true. The 
Collegiate Imps are still the original

WHAT NOTRE DAME SAYS
On November 24 a special traiu will arrive in Pittsburgh from Notre 
Dame. It will unload the Notre Dame baud, a largo delegation of Natre Dame 
students, and Gold and Blue supporters from South Bend and other cities. 
The studeuts of Notre Dame University are allowed to follow tho team on 
only one trip each year. This year they have selected the Carnegie Tech 
game as the one they want to see. Tho Notre. Dame Daily, ofllcial student 
publication of the Indiana school, has this to say of tho trip:
"Pittsburgh is the second metropolis of the Keystone state. It is an im
portant industrial city. In progress it ranks with tho loaders. In addition, 
it is a critical city and a skeptical one.
"Pittsburgh will be watching for tho Notre Dame delegation. It will eye 
proceedings critically, seeking faults. They will find none in a team that 
fights cleanly and always. When tho Fighting Irish team leaves there it will 
have the game and the hearts of the Pittsburgh sporting world with them. 
One thing more is to be gained, and only the student delegation can win that. 
By gentlemanly conduct they can win Pittsburgh for Notro Dame.
"Let's bring back Pittsburgh plus tho game.
Well said, say we. Your team won our hearts last your by their great 
exhibition of clean lighting, coupled with the best football we have soen jn 
some time.
Our guess is that the Irish will have to show some real football to get 
away with a victory next Saturday. The Skibos will have recovered from 
their recent slump and will enter the fray with renewed vigor gained from 
a good rest. On the other hand, the recent victory scored by Nobraska over 
Notre Dame means that the Indianians are not unbeatable and with good 
luck we might be able to send the conquerors of the Army, Georgia Tech and 
others back home with defeat chalked against them.
But dont go wrong on that Nebraska victory. At first thought, it might 
seem bad for Notre Damo, for tho record of the Huckers has not been im
pressive up to the time of that big victory. The Nebraska outfit is just 
the type of team that can outplay a light, fast team such as the Indiana Irish. 
They are very tall, and can scoop forward passes out of the air almost be
fore the Notre Dame men are within reaching distance. The latter wrere 
thus deprived of the use of their famed forward pass. Then, of course, the 
Huslcers had been primed and pointed for that particular fight jUBt as our 
men were trained to meet the attack of the Panther.
It looks like some game to us, with the accent on tho some.
GOLD FOOTBALLS
Look over at another column on this page and you will see that the 
Athletic Council has awarded the letter men of this years varsity football 
team gold footballs as a token of remembrance for tho Pitt victory.
We arts glad to see the football men thus rewardod and beliove that the 
entire student body will concur in sponsoring this moans of honoring the 
men.
SPIRIT AND MORE SPIRIT
The intense feeling of good fellowship that provailod last Friday when 
the Carnegie student body marched over across Fifth avenue and groetod 
the Pitt assemblage was a joy to behold. Pitt appreciated our good wishes 
for a victory 011 the morrow, and wo had a good time out of It ourselves. 
Take it from us, you who did not go on the little sally into the confines of 
our erstwhile enemy, you miss soolng a lot of happy smiles and hearing a 
lot of hearty cheers.
Right here It might not be amisB to compliment tho persons responsible 
for the signs which have been appearing weekly on tho face of Welch Hall. 
We dont know the names of thoso responsible, but they are real Carnogio 
men, wo know that. The Pitt students appreciate tho 0110 that hangs there 
this week and tho Pitt Weekly comments vory favorably on this manifesta
tion of our spirit of good will.
FAIRLEY RECEIVES PROMO

FOOTBALL SCHEDULE 
FOR 1924 OUT SOON
Next years football schodulo is 
rapidly approaching completion. Al
though some of tho important games 
have not yot boen finally scheduled, 
tho general make-up is fairly certain.
Pitt, W. & J., and Notro Damo will 
bo on tho schedule. Theso three 
gamos have boon arranged for and 
will constitute three of tho five ma
jor events. Great effort iB being mado 
to schedule a game with Penn Stato. 
Everyone knows or the fine relations 
which have existed between Cnrnegio 
Tech and Stato Colloge in the past.
This year, our schedule was too 
heavy to permit tho extra burdon of a 
gamo with Ponn State. It would bo 
gratifying to tho student body of Car. 
negio to seo Stato as ono of our op
ponents next year.
Otlior games which will probably bo 
on the schodulo are Westminister and 
Thiol. Thoso gamos will be played 
oarly in the season. Nothing doflnito lias boon dono as yot in rogard 
to other gamos.

NEXT YEARS SCHEDULE
Is a thing of very groat interest just now. Nothing definite is ready for 
release as yet. but Buddy Ovorend states that we will very likely moot about 
four strong teams, with several oaslor games intorsporsed through the 
program.
Besides the Pitt and W. & J. contests, Notro Dame and possibly Ponn 
State will be signed up. Also, wo vonturo to predict that tho comploted 
program will contain at least 0110 surprlso. There Ib no doubt, however, that 
the next schedule will be better planned than was tho 0110 just bolng brought 
to a close. The number of hard games in succession worn vory hard 011 tho 
team. We are not criticising anyono. This years Bchodulo was the culmin
ation of a group of unfortunate clrcumstancos and not tho rosult of anyone's 
boneheadedness.
IN CONCLUSION
We are sorry to stato that tho collqsal battle of tho Groolcs has been 
called off due to administration disapproval.
Also, tho gossips say that there Is still a good chance that a hockey 
team will be organized this winter, so keop hoping and looking for nows.
Tho cross-country tonni had hard luck Saturday In thoir moot, with Pitt 
and Allegheny. Pitt copped first placo with a margin of ono point on tho 
Skibos.

in a real home. The warm greeting 
of tho hostess and the welcome from 
the other members of tho household 
make ono feel that It Is truly a family. 
Miss Abbott, who is In charge of tho 
house, aids in this illusion by moth
ering tho whole ilock. In a general 
sense Miss Abbott directs the house, 
that is, she criticizes the manage
ment and the work performed, but 
the girls plan and do all the work 
themselves. Positions are shifted j 
each week so that at the end of the 
six weeks residence, each girl has 
had an opportunity to plan and do 
practically uill the' work in connec
tion with managing a house occupied 
by a family of seven or eight, it 
is distinctly a problem in household 
management, and the girls are grad
ed and given credit for this work as 
am Important part of their Household 
Economics course.
The girls who entertained the rc1 porter on November 3 are certainly 
to be /crmmended for the spic and 
span appearance of the house and 
the graceful case and precision with 
which everything was managed.

The Alumni in the Detroit district 
turned'out with their friends three 
hundred strong to greet the football 
team at the University of Detroit 
Stadium, Saturday, November 10th. On 
Friday the 9th, about 12 members of 
the committee in charge of arrange
ments met the team and co'aches at 
the Hotel Statler and lunched with 
them.
The cheering at the game indicated 
that the old Carnegie spirit is still 
present. Over, three hundred alumni 
augmented by the fifty or more bum
mers certainly held their own against 
the entire Detroit rooting section.

Owes to the Imagination
From An Argument Over 
Watches Came KDKA
summoned to the office of Harry Phillips 
Davis, Vico President of the company.
Frank, said Mr. Davis, Im going to 
close your radio station. His attention had 
been attracted the night before to a simple 
note in a full-page advertisement, which read, 
Mr. Conrad will send out phonograph music 
this evening.
You know the rest. In November, 1920, 
KDKA was formally opened to send out 
election returns. It had received the first 
license issued by Uncle Sam. Today over 500 
broadcasting stations entertain and educate 
millions of people each night, a wonderful 
result from so insignificant an argument as 
one over watches.
Iv 0RU TJACK in the days when wireI ^ less was just beginning to
j spread, Frank Conrad (now
' Assistant Chief Engineer of the
i Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company) and another 
if$-3 i official, happened to compare

I ^ that the naval station at Arling ton, Va., had just inaugurated
a system for sending out daily 
time signals by radio. Just the thing to prove 
his point!
So he built a simple set of receiving apparatus, ^
erected an aerial, andyou can imagine what 
happened! He was badly bitten by the radio bug. m-j |J|
After proving to his satisfaction the accuracy of his 
watch, he started experimenting with the transmission of music by radio, with good success.
He began sending out. phonograph music from . rll
his home, and attracted the attention of some of I I Eall
the big department stores, I hat had installed radio plliii
departments. They in turn, started advertising Is||g
Mr. Conrads musical evenings.
