Dusts composed of materials found In the human body and'soluble In the body Julcos seldon cause trouble, he said, but dusts which are insoluble In the body, if/terge, cause bronchitis, and if minute, pneumonia. While the use. of pneumatic tools Is causing the moBt important duct hazard ot th t present, he pointed out, recont dovices for catching the dust generated are now available. Tbe air Bvnpioc from the tool Is used on tho ejector principle, he explained, to actuate au exhaust cut'fent of air which draws away 
the dust and carries It to a flannel- bng iilter. Th principio employed in this device when generally applied. he said, should make pneu amV tools, safe, to use.nnd remove mucn of th BJJica-dust hazard from the mining Industry.In Kpenklnjt of his own 1nvo6ll- gatlons in British Industries, be claimed that dusts differ In their effects on tbe human lungs. v*For the mi'st pnrts. ho eald "dust of animal origin are fairly- harmless and so are most of vegetable origin, duets such aa coal and flour; but vegetable husks from cotton and flax set up a tendency to bronchitis and. pneumonia and GEST lo spasmodic asthma" V.Among soluble dusts that cause  bronchitis or /pneumonia, Dr. UTEEEV grouped carborundum, emery, and . glass.: One dust, that of silica, arlaiPE-from flint, quart? zite metalUrrous rock, sandstones and granite wan placed In a special class. * It orfgiimos bronchitis, ho asserted, .when particles dre /large anit~piWmou<aVwheir.nto,Uteftbut:ll- slowly dissolves in the lungs and chnngp them from elastic spongy organs Into rubber-llke materials.

THATS the way P. A. talks to you n the bowl 
of a pipe. This great? national gloom-chaser 
stabs the darkest clouds v/ith ,a ray of sunshine. 
Buy a tidy red tin of Prince Albert today and 
see.- Tamp a load of this friendly tobacco into 
your jimmy-pipe and light up.
Cool as a sub-cellar. Sweet as the breath of 
fresh-cut violets. Fragrant in the tin. and fra
grant as you smoke it. Never a fongue-bite or 
a throat-parch. So mild you can hit it up from 
sun-up to sun-down, yet with a body that satisfies 
completely...
Theres more philosophy in a pipe-load of 
P. A. than in the average Doctors thesis. No 
matter what brand you are smoking, now, you 
dont know how much your jimmy-pipe can 
mean to you until you pack it with good old 
Prince Albert. Get started now.

Railroad trains running on Timken Beanngs represent 
the most significant development in the history of friction 
elimination. When you realize that Timken-equipped 
trains can be started with only one-eighth oi the power 
formerly needed, and that the old hot box dangers are 
gone, you begin to sense the meaning of this latest 
Timken achievement. -
For a long time Timken has been approaching this 
climax. Timken Tapered Roller Beanngs have become 
universal m motor vehicles. They have swept industry, 
being used in machinery of every type, sponsored1 by the 
most highly reputed engineering institutions. In Trans. portation, Manufacture, Mining, and Agriculture 
Timken Beanngs identify the most modern designs of 
the most progressive equipment manufacturers.
It is certain that engineers of every class will beincreas-, 
ingly concerned with the greater mechanical endurance 
and operating economies made.possible by Timken 
Tapered Roller Beanngs. - -
