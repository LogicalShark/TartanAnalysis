OBIE NEWMAN TO
HEAD THE CAST
Surprise Element Will ^erve 
to Make Musical Comedy 
Popular Show
Just four days from today, Collegiately Speaking will open at the Sy
ria- Mosque. Everything is ready; 
the cast knows its lines, the chorus 
has perfected all its steps, the songs 
have been written, and most of the 
seats have been sold. From present 
indications it looks like a sell out:
- the^. biggest audience which ever at
tended a single performance, of a 
Campus Week show. Russ Roller, 
who is handling the ticket sales, says 
that there are still many good seats 
left which will be on sale at the 
Alumni Office, and at Mellors, down
town.
As to the show itself, the commit
tee has obstinately refused to give 
any further details of the plot than 
have already been published, claim
ing that the surprise element will 
serve to make the show all the more 
enjoyable. For this reason, the writ
er has been forbidden to tell what 
goes on, although he has been for
tunate enough to pass the guards and 
be present at one of the rehearsals.
There are some things, however, 
which may well be said. With Obie 
Newman heading. the cast, the show 
is bound to be good, and the remain
der of the cast, which has not re
ceived Its just publicity, is excep
tionally well cast.
Ann Luria, who takes the leading 
part, is going to make a big hit with 
the students. She portrays the part 
of a southern girl, who is a guest at 
the house party at the time of the 
exciting events which take place in 
the story. She combines the comedy 
element with the dramatic to such a 
degree that her characterization is 
almost perfect. While she will bring 
laughter, she will also inspire a sort 
of wistfulness, at least in the part 
of the male spectators. The girls 
will love her too, and feel for her in 
the situation in which she finds her(Continued on Page Four.)
FRATERNITIES' URGED
TO DISPLAY BANNERS 
Relying on the intuition of the
 fraternity men, and the strength
 of Carnegie tradition, the Cam pus Week Committee did not 
1 send out any suggestions con1 cerning the displaying of Camp us Week banners on the fratern ty houses this year. Needless
 to say, this harmless but at tractive form of advertising
 meets with the favor of all Car1 negie proponents.
It is hoped that this article 
1 will dispell all doubt as to the
 advisability of this practicea
 doubt that seems to prevail at
 presentand bring forth a 
1 typically; Carnegian crop of iri genious displays. No limits of
 size or shape are dictated, no 
 style or wording is proposed,
 the matter is left entirely to the
 discretion of the individual fra ternities.

Last week the Kilties enjoyed one 
of the most successful week-end trips 
of the season, visiting Wheeling and 
Bellairo. After a highly appreciated 
performance in Wheeling, they were 
entertained by the Alpha Pi Sigma 
fraternity at their club. Dave Gar
bers Kiltie Jass Orchestra, which be
came famous almost over night, fur
nished music for the dance. Caleb 
Hornbostle, who went with the band 
on the trip, gave a highly appreci
ated performance.
Last Thursday night the band ap
peared in full regalia at Turtle Creek 
High School Auditorium. Eddie New
man sang. Mr. Hornbostle perform
ed, and both the band and the audi
ence thoroughly enjoyed the per
formance.
Members of the band are urged to 
be present at all the Campus Week 
events at which the band will func
tion. The freak band, composed 
mostly of old band members, will be 
present on various occasions. Direct
ly after the Qualification Day exer
cises which will take place at 2:00 
p. m. on Thursday, the Caper of the 
Kilts is scheduled. On Friday at 9:30 
a. m., the band will play after the 
Sweepstakes performance, and later

On floors of ballroom fineness, to 
enthralling collegiate harmony, a 
thousand costumed peoples will glide 
at the gayest, most captivating, and 
most romantic of costume parades 
Carnegies Mardi Gras, to take place 
in the Gym and Union on Friday 
night from nine till two.
Madly flitting lights that dart here 
and there will reveal the faces of 
the dancers as with mingled joy and 
surprise they tread on the glassy 
floors of the Gymnasium polished, and 
transformed as never before, a danc
ing palace unequaled. But what is it 
that holds this mighty crowd? What 
is it that fills the very air, that seems 
to come as though from magic rising 
and falling, in marvelous time and 
harmony? It is the sublime, all pow
erful, inimitable musical score of the 
two finest orchestras in the country, 
The Steel City Collegians and our 
own Collegiate Imps. Having played 
at all the large dances of the sea
son, the musical organizations will at
tempt to make this final of Campus 
Week dances their crowning achieve
ment.
With the finest orchestras that 
anyone could wish for it is not to be 
doubted that the feverish though sec
ret designing, deliberating, and de
vising that is the common lot of all 
on the campus, is for unrivalled cos
tumes to grace the great affair. Like 
phantoms, knights of old will ride 
that night; gay iSpanisli caveliers, and

CARNEGIE MEN TO BE 
SENT TO SILVER BAY
As in previous years, several Car 
negie men will be sent this year to 
the Silver Bay Intercollegiate Con
ference for a period of about ten 
days.
'It is the wish of the Y. M. C. A. 
that this group be as representative 
as possible; therefore all fraternities 
and dormitories are urged to hand 
in the names of candidates from 
which list of names a part of the 
delegation will be chosen.
There will be representatives of 
the sixty foremost colleges of the 
United States at the Silver Bay Con
ference. The program will be a 
varied and most interesting on'e. In
cluded among the speakers are such 
men of national prominence as Stew
ard Eddy, John R. Mott, A. R. Petty, 
(Continued on Page Four.)
The Western Association will hold 
its annual Campus Week luncheon 
in the Commons on Friday, May 15, 
at 1 oclock p. m. All alumni, facul
ty members and students whose 
homes are in the west are cordially 
invited to attend. The election of 
officers for the coming school year 
will take place at this time and an 
excellent program of stunts and mu
sical numbers has been arranged.
Sweepstake Races 
Start at 9:00 Friday
All Letter Men Are Ineligible 
to Compete in Event
With cars completed, teams select
ed, and drivers ready to go, the stage 
is all set for the premier event of 
Campus Week, the Interfraternity 
Sweepstakes. Nine-thirty, Friday 
morning is the time set for this race, 
which will be preceded by the girls' 
sweepstakes, a half hour earlier.
Preparations have been made to 
handle a large crowd, the R. O. T. C. 
having been asked to furnish a de
tachment to patrol the course. It is 
asked that no automobiles be park
ed along the course, and that pedes
trians watching the race keep to the 
sidewalks, in order to eliminate any 
possibilities of accident.
The officials are Mr. Pfouts, Mr. 
Dosey, and Doc Marks, timers; and 
Professors Leeds, Ashe and Ambrose, 
judges.. All of them are well able to 
handle these important positions.
Two cups are to .be awarded, one 
to the best designed car, and one to 
the winner of the race. However, if 
the same fraternity wins both cups, 
the design will be awarded to the 
second best car. This is one of the' 
rules which has prevailed for years. 
The only radical change in the rules 
this year being that one which ap
plies to the eligibility of pushers.
As regards this matter, some mis
understanding was caused by the 
rules published in The Tartan two 
weeks ago, stating that only men who 
! had earned major varsity letters 
would . be ineligible. Since cross 
I country is a minor sport, and since 
j it has been decided that these men 
I are ineligible to compete, fraternities 
j are requested to note that all men 
j who have earned letters in any branch 
of sport are ineligible to participate. 
Men who are now on varsity or plebe 
teams engaged in spring sports are 
also ineligible, even though they, have 
not yet won a letter, since they might 
injure themselves and be lost to their 
teams for the Campus Week sports.

PROMPTLY AT 10
Singing, Dancing, Comedy 
and Jazz Comprise Very 
Good Program
Promptly at ten oclock Thursday 
morning, tho curtains of tho Music 
Hall will bo drawn apart to disclose 
the first act of the most ambitious 
vaudeville-bill that* over servod as 
cocktail to a C. W. feast. Everything 
that makes a complote program Is 
provided,singing, dancing, jazz,
comedy, a miniature musical show, 
beauty, art, shapelinoss, exquisito set
tings, and a superb orchostru.
If any of tho acts could be called 
rho headliner, It would probably be 
that of U. P. Eglzl, and his Cameo 
Recording Orchestra from tho Olym
pic theater. Tills organization boasts 
of twolvo musicians as clever as any 
In the country. They will play popu
lar numbers In their own finished and 
inimitable style.
Tho chorus and cast of Thotn. Taus 
revue, "No, No, Brownie! lias boon 
rehearsing faithfully under the capa
ble directipn of Leslie Boebe. Tho 
act has some good tunes and clever 
steps. Minetti and Dashbacli arc tho 
comedians and Jimmy Robertson 
dances a fast and fascinating clog.
Haldene and Albright themselves, 
wrote tho skit in which they will 
play the leads. They will bo sup
ported by a cast from tho Drama De
partment. The skit has to do with 
I the embarrassing situation into which 
a college student Is suddenly precipi
tated,-and it fairly bristles with wise 
cracks and amusing complications.

Plans Completed For a Varied
Program on Qualification Day
The committee on Qualification Day, i 
under the chairmanship of Carey j 
Proctor, has worked up a program j 
which should make Qualification Day j 
one of the most interesting of Cam-1 
pus Week gala days. The three main 
events of the afternoon will be the 
parade, the kaper of the Kilties and 
the call.
The parade has always been one of 
the big features of Campus Week. It 
is an inspiring sight and one fully in 
keeping with Carnegie spirit. The pa
rade will be made up as follows: 
First, A1 Minetti and his company of 
burlesquers. Second, the KiRie band. 
Third, the pall-bearers with the coffin 
of Old Man Plebe Regulations. 
Fourth, the mourners, and the Plebe 
girls and Plebe fellows.
The parade will proceed to the Ath-j 
letic Field and the coffin will be taken 1 
up before the speakers stand. The 
"Freshmen will then march past the |
coffin single file and each Plebe will 
drop some article of regulations in 
the open coffin.
Immediately following this Mike 
Kallfelz will welcome the Plebes into 
the clan. At this time the welding of 
the link will take place. Each year a 
new link is welded on the chain, sig
nifying the addition of one more class 
for good old Carnegie. The link will 
be welded by one of the Freshmen and 
will betar the class numerals 28.
Jack Horner will make the response 
for the Plebes and tiie pall-bearers 
will then carry the Coffin to the grave. 
Walt Rogers will act as minister and 
will preside at the burial of Old Man 
Plebe Regulations.
The success of the parade depends 
entirely upon the number of Plebes 
that participate in it. Impressiveness 
will be proportional to numbers. 
Every Freshman who has any' pride

j other colleges. * This Is the first year

CAMPUS WEEK
It seems scarcely a year ago that Campus Week was lielcl, and 
here it is again. Tomorrow night the migratorics unofficially open 
the celebration, and Thursday will see the official opening oi! what 
promises to be the best Campus Week ever held on the Campus.
The completed program is very attractiveevery event has been 
carcl'iilly worked out, and the event of a musical comedy Saturday 
night will wind up one of the most carefully prepared-for three days 
in the history oi! Carnegie Tech.
Campus Week really marks the beginning and end of the school 
year so far as student .activities are concerned. The old Student, 
Council will shortly step out; the new class officers will assume their 
duties; the new officials for the band, musical clubs, and publications 
will step into tho shoes of their predecessors, and the honornrics will 
cull the men who have done most for their classes during the past 
year.The Carnegie Tartan feels that the past year lias been one oJ im
provement so far as activities were concerned. It is difficult to place 
definitely on any particular thing which marks advancement, yet we 
feel that things havo run more smoothly during the past year than 
ever before; the joint assemblies have helped make for a more com
plete understanding between schools; the inauguration of the budget 
organizations committee on the Student Council has placed the vai ious non-athletic activities on a sounder business basis; tho new joint 
student council-l!aculty committee assures a more harmonious co
operation between these two branches of the school, and provides 
machinery for smoothing out tho. difficulties which from time to tune
arise. , ,Wo would like, at this time, to congratulate the various men who 
have worked so hard for tho various campus organizations, but the 
list is so long that it would be scarcely feasible. Suffice i! to say 
that wo feel that we are just ending the most successful year which 
lie non-athletic activities have experienced, with but few exceptions, 
and'we wish to tho new officers, both class, assembly and organiza
tion III" best (ill luck !'> 11).  <>inin;year._________________________

THE WEEK IN THE
WORLD8 NEWS
From what nev/a wo glean from tho 
African Cahloa and from what wo 
can read between the llnoa in tho 
French oftlclal coinrnunlcutlona, the 
alIllation In Northern Africa between 
tho regular troopa and the Riffs from 
the territory of South Tungler can
not be takon as lightly us moat accounta would have UN believe.
In 1012, an agreement waa algned 
between France and Spain, limiting 
their respective apherea In Northern 
Africa* Tho area juat aouth of Tan
gier, a narrow atrip, wUs put under 
Spanish influence, which la the cauae 
of much trouble, for within thla urea 
la tho refuge of u horde of brlganda 
and political agltatora. Theao men 
swarm over the, French boundry 
line and are at the bottom of much 
of tho local disturbance. A body of 
Riff a, wundorlng nomads, under the 
leadership of Abd-el*Krlm, dofented 
tho Spunlah army and put It to flight. 
This having boon successfully accom
plished, the tribe has gradually filter
ed over the French frontier and lo
cated itself lit a desertod post whore 
It Is in close contact, with the Mor
occan people.
The tactics of their leader are sel
dom in mass action, but in the stirr
ing up. of enmities in each tribe and 
allowing each tribal chief to head his 
own band.
Thla kind of tribal warfare is most 
difficult to break up. By appealing 
to tiie ancient enmities of the Arab 
plainsmen and the mountain Berbers, 
Abd-el-Krlm has been able to give It; 
the character of a holy war. Having 
been victorious over Q'pain, he has 
been forced, by his own fanatics, to 
move toward Fez, the capital of Mor
occo and chief point of attack in an 
attempt to aet hlniBolf up us Sultan.
The dlfflcultlea of proceeding 
against Marshall Lyautey are going 
to be much greater than those en
countered in the Spanish campaign, 
for ho has 90,000 troops, three-fourths 
of whom are well trainod Moroccans, 
and besides lie la an experienced man 
in just this Bort of task. But this 
sort of fighting will always be diffi
cult, especially when a religious fer
vor has been added to It. The Rlffa 
have massed together 2,000 men and 
are procoeding against the French 
from three points with Fez the cen
ter of a line sixty miles long. At 
proaont they have tho hotter of the 
altuatlon, having Inflicted severe 
losses upon tho French.
Tho moat sorloua phnao la the pos
sibility of the unification of the Mor
occans under a Mohammedan bannor 
which would mean an end to white 
rule, trade and colonization in North 
ern Africa, and tho end of relative 
peace and prosperity.

may ontor, tho Carnoglo graduate, it 
will be fenced off In tho lower end 
of the Gym, a Mecca to the ones for 
whom Campus Week was founded, 
our ululimi.
The Collegiuns, twelve in number, 
will be seuted on a raised and decor
ator platform, directly opposite from 
a large scientifically designed sound
ing board, which will distribute tho 
tones with equal intensity at all 
points of the polished floor. An en
gineering triumph indeed will be this 
fancy dress ball, for men of great 
ability have been working on the 
floor and on the acoustical designs 
for the affair, and results will more 
than fulfill the hopes and desires of 
all.
Realizing the necessity of a free 
and ready entrance to the Gym, the 
plan is to have everyone enter at 
the middle entrance and then proceed 
either through the locker room where 
checking service will be rendered, or 
by the stairway at the entrance, to 
the floor where flood lights aided by 
twinkling multi-colored lanterns, illu
minate th muse ladened air. When 
the time comes that some couple shall 
decide to investigate tho Union where 
the Imps, nine of them, the Champion 
Carnegie orchestra, bask in the dull 
light of tho revolving lighthouse with 
Its hanging lights, to be plnced in the 
center of the floor, let them exit only 
by tho upper entrance. This is tho 
order,
Two things aro absolutely neces
sary to gain admission to the palaco 
of Joy, ovoryono must havo a cos
tume, and with It a ticket to plead 
the way for entrance. Without those 
nocosaltios mortal man cannot force 
tho doors that guard tho coveted 
place.
Behind the scenes of this activity, 
the guiding hand that directs all the 
destiny of this, tho bigost dance of 
the year stands the committee head
ed by M. Goodwin, chairman. Mem
bers have been drawn from all tho 
colleges, and each has carried out 
Ills or her part of the work. Florence 
Jones of Arts, has charge of the Cam
pus Week tags and Is the designer of 
these valued tickets ;t Edith Warren, 
from Margaret Morrison, is the sec
retary; George Murphy, of Industries 
secured the orchestras: Kline Fulmer 
has charge of special designs aud fin
ishing the floor; and Vern Wendlandt 
of Science, secured the sounding 
board and the acoustical arrange
ments.
Now here was medicine for the 
mind, hud we but wit to receive it; 
This one thing might bring us out of 
the frenzy of middle cluas ethics in 
which wo dwell; to luugh with Falstuff in u tuvern. Ah, if we only 
could. But the fun making of the 
great Elizabethans Is a lost urt. Tliut 
wus the luughter of the good brown 
eurth .when puritanlsm was as yet 
only a menace. We live in a sudder 
und not wiser world. Even our antipurituns ure so self conscious tliut 
Insteud of being nuturul they are 
merely naughty, und therefore not vi
rile. Throughout the Middle Ages the 
world wus ufllicted us it Is now with 
spiritual dyspeptics who can not di
gest the whole of life and nourish the 
sould * therewith. Hence the sick 
heresy that separates soul und body, 
hence unbeuutlful usceticlsm, hence 
nieugre und troublesomely pious folk 
of all sorts. But until the middle 
clasB set about to reform the world, 
In the centuries following good Queen 
Bess, the puritan blaaphemy against 
life was kept in check by the great 
sane laughter of such men as Caucer 
and Shakespeare. Indeed there is a 
philosophy of wholeness In the Inspir
ed smut stories of our early literature, 
and It Is the worse for us that we 
cannot fathom it.
Yes, it is a great good thing for us 
to study and enuct the Fulstuff pluys. 
Merry Wives Is perhaps the weakest 
of the four. It was written to order, 
to ploa,se the queen wlio wnnted to 
see Falstaff In love, and wants the 
1N: of the First and Second Henry 
IV. Even so, properly acted it might 
bring to us the sound of that great 
forgot,ton laughter of the taverns in 
Merrle England. 1 have seen two pro
ductions, In Germany, which did so.
1 cannot help feeling that wo missed 
It hero. Mr. Paynes rare and appre
ciative directing lifted tho perform
ance above tho commonplace, it waa 
Intoroatlng. But ono felt throughout 
tho actors lack of vitality. There 
was a nlconesa about them, whore 
there should havo boon a great earth! 
ness. Bon Wlnoblatta FalstalT was 
good, though a little uneven. At his 
best he gave us tho fat knights nim
ble wit and ahameloss zost. and was 
almost, If not quite, vulgar enough. 
He was so delightful that 1 for ono 
would give much to see him as the 
greater Falstaff of tho Boars Head, 
which la more than 1 could say of any 
other actor In this country. Some of 
tho minor parts wore almost perfect, 
But the merry wives themselves wore 
tho weak spot In the play. I saw six 
girls in the two parts, and not one of 
them quite hit it. Elizabeth Sowers 
by looked like a younger and daintier 
Queen Elizabeth, and played with linish, as usual; but she was far too 
high-bred in the part. Beth Landsay 
was charming, but her type is Early 
Victorian, not sixteenth century. 
Claire Schellhase and Mary Brown 
were nearest; impish and individual 
as Shakespeares women should be, 
and with a little more time on the 
part they might have attained the 
missing vulgarity. Zest they had, but 
not enough of the good coarseness of 
a Windsor citizens wife. All the girls 
bore their bodies too seemly, as 
Touchstone would say. But there 
was promise. And Mary Power was a 
perfect Dame Quickly.
It goes without saying that Harry 
Mervis with his splendid vitality and 
his long training under Mr. Payne 
gave a finished and joyous interpreta
tion of Dr. Caius. That one expected, 
for his acting is of an even excellence 
and his own temperament happily 
Elizabethan. So also, one expected 
Donald Maryes excellent comedy 
sense to develop an individual and 
amusing Sir Hugh, as he llid. But it 
was unexpected good fortune to find 
two plebes, Donald Willson and Her
man Greenberg, making such delight
ful bits of tho two servants.
Hardlo Albright and Verner Hal
dene woro vory different as Ford, and 
both Interesting. Harle attained more 
of roistering fun. Yornle played with 
:i quaint seriousness, making the part 
almost straight. Tlloro was a similar 
difference in the two Slenders. Dickey 
played a very Elizabethan comedy of 
humors, whore Hall appeared natural
ly and engagingly idiotic. The other 
mens parts were well though not 
strikingly done. Ben Ford made 
something of Mine Host, and Bob 
Aldordlce of Page, an Schwartz of 
Bardolph. Virginia Williams was so 
delightful as the school boy that she 
quite justified that unmotivated scene, 
arid little Marsh was a priceless imp 
Df a page. Those responsible for the 
technical work deserve especial 
praise for the good yet simple sets 
and the quick dark changes.

What did Adam do before Eve came

machine could ever have given, thus 
making possible the work itself. As 
for George Eliot, she most certainly 
did produce her work in co-opera
tion with a man, her husband, Mr. 
Lewis, whose companionship and un
derstanding brought out the best in 
her.
Shakespeare did his best work in 
London. When at home he spent his 
time poaching and getting jailed for 
it. You say that Milton "permitted 
his wife to copy off his manuscripts. 
Poor, blind Milton was deeply gratefupl to have her ibe eyes for him. 
And anyway, wasnt his daughter 
his amanuensis?
I note your re-incarnation choice. 
You say that when caid Chinese (not 
Chinaman!) of high birth wishes to 
marry he gets himself a wife edu
cated in such a way as to be a suit
able companion to him in his life. 
Fine!. According to your description 
of his life all he has to do is to 
enjoy himself. Friend wife helps him 
to do just that. Fine co-operation!
But we were speaking of great 
things, though you seem to think 
such a life about perfect, which 
shows how high you aim. Dear 
young man, you need an Eve to 
teach you a few things.
As for me, I cant spend any more 
time pointing out the error of your 
ways as I have a big job on hand, 
co-operating with Friend (Husband in

meal flavored by the wit and wisdom 
of The Tartan staff. However, the 
principal feature will be the food 
which should delight even the gour

TUESDAY, MAY 12, 1925THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
PLAID ATHLETICS -
PLAID TRACK TEAM 
WINS FROM GENEVA
THIS WEEK IN SPORTS.
Bastian Takes the Individual 
Honors in Second Victory 
of Season
The Carnegie track team won its 
second dual meet o the season by 
-easily defeating Geneva College last 
Saturday in the Bowl. The varsity 
meet was held in conjunction with 
the interscholastic carnival, and came 
to a close with, the Plaid on the large 
end of a 89 to 48 score. The su
premacy of the Tartans was demon
strated in the field events when they 
piled up 48 points to Genevas 16. The 
margin was not so hig on the track, 
however, for the home athletes were 
content to lead their opponents by 
but nine points in the running events.
Bastian was high point scorer of 
the meet, taking first in the javelin 
and shot put, and tying Hamilton of 
the visitors, for first place in the 
broad jump. Captain Jack Bright al
so came through brilliantly, capturing 
first place in the mile and second in 
the two-mile. Hobe, of Carnegie, 
won the latter race, leading Bright 
by a matter of inches.

ALLEGHENY WRONG IN HAM
MER THROW CONTROVERSY
For the edification of Tartan read
ers we wish to announce that the 
track meet more than a week ago 
with Allegheny College resulted In a 
victory for the Skibos, as had been 
previously announced.. The misun
derstanding regarding the hammer 
throw was unfortunate, to say the 
least, but inasmuch as the contract 
signed by both schools 6ald nothing 
about eliminating that event from 
the list, It was perfectly correct and 
proper to hold the event. Many 
readers of The Tartan are under the 
impression that the meet was award
ed to Allegheny, but such is not the 
case.
Because of lack of space, the Plaid 
Screen has been omitted this week.

W. V. TAFFNER, General Agent
Although trying hard to make it 
two in a row over Penn State, the 
Tartan team nevertheless was not 
up to the form they showed a week 
ago, and as a result were forced to 
take the wrong end of the 8 to 6 
score at Forbes Field Friday. Con
rad was hit freely at times but 
might have won had it not been for 
costly misplays by him teammates.
With their former victory fresh in 
their minds, the' Skibos started out 
well, keeping pace with the State 
aggregation for four innings and 
matching run for run. Then, aided 
by some weird fielding, the Nittany 
Lions forged ahead and maintained 
a safe lead until the .Tartans staged 
a sharp rally in the seventh, which 
netted four runs but fell one short 
of tying the score. This was Carne
gies final effort, so when State add
ed another marker it settled the out
come decisively.
Whether or not the fact of play
ing on a big league ball-field had 
anything to do with it, neither nine 
displayed the class of which they 
are capable, State making five errors 
and Carnegie being charged with 
seven. These figured largely in the 
run-making of both teams, State get
ting one as a result of a passed ball 
in the fifth and the Plaid being pre
sented with one when an opposing 
outfielder dropped an easy fly in the 
fourth. Max Bastian and Vogt did 
some timely hitting and Bastian also 
contributed some fancy catches in 
the outfield. Wally Lynch made one 
nice stop but also shared with Joe 
Diffley the lead in errors made, both 
being charged with three. Conrad 
pitched creditably for the most part 
but was hampered by wabbly sup
port.

MSLES SHOPPE
PENN AVENUE AT FRANKSTOWN.....................EAST LIBERTY {<
OPEN MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY EVENINGS *
Alumni will be pleased to know that 
in the final arrangements for Mardi 
Gras that they have been especially 
favored by having a dance floor re
served for their own individual use. 
This Innovation plus the club room, 
which has been set apart as a place 
of meeting for alumni, should greatly 
assist in the problem of finding each 
other on the campus.
The planning committee has made 
these two additions in answer to the 
suggestions offered by alumni who at
tended last year. Also to make the 
graduate feel that Campus Week is 
really an affair for alumni.
Three places will be set apart as 
a meeting place. The trophy room 
in the new gym will be the club room 
for both men and women. At Mardi 
Gras a part of the gym floor will be 
roped off and called "Alumni Fioor. 
The other meeting point for your ex
clusive use will be the Faculty Club 
room in Central Building.
It is believed by the committee 
that these three places should bring 
the graduates together and make 
their return a bigger and better oc
casion. Alumni are urged to become 
acquainted with the location of the 
places and use them.
The decorations for Mardi Gras 
will be similar to other years except 
that flood lights will be used in the 
gym. In the Union there will be a 
revolving light-house which will 
throw out shafts of light against re
flectors. The - decorations, committee 
have planned carefully tills year. 
They aim to have unique and pleas
ing combinations of color and light-- 
ing effects.
The only entrance to the gym
nasium floor on Friday night will be 
in the center of the building. The 
check room will be placed in the 
mens locker room. From here two 
stairways lead up to the floor. The 
exit will be at ,the upper, end of the 
floor which, is usually known as the 
main entrance but for this occasion 
must be called the main exit.
After you get all togged out in 
your costume, be sure you have your 
C. W. tag with you and then meet 
at Mardi Gras for the 'Sixth and best 
frolic of any year.
ALL ALUMNI URGED TO HAVE 
COSTUMES AND C. W. TICKETS 
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT FROLICCostumes must be worn at the Mar
di Gras. All alumni are earnestly re
quested to keep this in mind, and to 
come dressed in the most fantastic 
robes which they can commandeer.
Tags, also, are requisites. They 
must be presented at the door to gain 
admittance, and must have been ob
tained from the Alumni Office, for 
they will not be sold on Friday night. 
If some ajbsent minded or procrasti
nating alumnus has neglected to or
der his tags, there is a possibility 
that he may obtain them by applica
tion at the Alumni Office during the 
early part of this week.

Dormitory rooms for either men or 
women may be obtained at fifty

AT C. W. COUNTRY FAIR
Puppet will be on sale during Cam

Country Fair. All issues can be se
cured there, including the gala Cam

This number will be of special in
terest to Alumni as it will have many 
jokes, quips and witticisms that per
tain to them, or have a special mean
ing for alumni only. A dazzling ar
ray of now, fresh jokes will surprise, 
shock, and sustain you for many a 
day.
One sad thing about the Campus 
Week number is that there will be 
no old joke friends to greet you 
open The Puppet. The standbys of 
previous Campus Week issues have 
heon sont to an old folks home to 
spend the rest of their lives.
Alumni! Get your Puppet Campus

hilarious timo.
GIRLS STUNT CUP
DONATED FOR FAIR
(Continued From Page One.)
In tho evening.
A plan of the grounds ut Forbes 
and Woodlawn has been drawn, 
showing the location of the various 
tents, platforms and other apparation necessary for the staging of the 
many unique stunts to be presented. 
The number and variety of these 
stunts, the special police force, the 
band, and the favors that are prom
ised, presage a great crowd, and an 
afternoon without a single dull mo
ment.
Tho nature of the favors will not 
be divulged until the afternoon of 
the fair, but it . is promised that 
there will be enough for all, and 
that all will be pleased.
It is announced with deepest re
grets that the greased pig contest 
must be eliminated because of the 
incapacitation of the star performer 
at his quarters in Chicago. Although 
the committee could have secured a 
porker of lesser ability for the occa
sion, quality was considered an es
sential, in their opinion, wherefore 
someone will have to forego the 
pleasure of taking noine the bacon.
The Country Fair Committee will 
be indebted to the Mays Drug Com
pany for the thousands of pack
ages of tooth paste, face powder and 
face cream which will be distributed 
free on Saturday afternoon. A gen
erous taste of each of these house
hold commodities will be given to 
everyone in attendance, giving stu
dents a chance to supply themselves 
with toilet necessities gratis.
A second denotation halls from the 
Reynolds Tobacco Company in the 
form of 5,000 Camel cigarettes and 
a wide array of favorite pipe tobacso. Tho committee will furnish corn 
cob pipes, tho he-man's favorite, so 
that no Carnegian, be it male or fe
male, will be without smokes at the 
fair.

Lake George, is an ideal place for a 
summer gathering. > Boating, swim

will add to the visitors good time.
All men interested in the Silver
(Continued From Page One.)
The collegiate slant that the authors 
have given to the piece will afford 
the audience a ready appreciation of 
its humor. The authors guarantee a 
laugh every twenty seconds. That is 
a conservative estimate.
Jack Gumbert will sing in the pro
logue. Bob Guhder wrote the words 
to airs taken from the opera, Pagllacci. The words, the music, and 
Jacks voice ought to make a pro
logue that will entrance the most 
aesthetic.
Even before the prologue, however, 
several important events will take 
place. First of all, the new Student 
Council will be introduced, and the 
president, if he cannot avoid it, may 
make a speech. The donors of the 
interfraternity track cups will then 
present those, emblems of athletic su
periority to the victors in the recent 
meet- And last, but not by several 
kilometers least, the stately and 
gracious Campus Queen, whom we 
still sometimes forget to address as 
"Your Royal Highness, will grace 
the stage with her blushing presence 
for a few precious moments.
A popular addition to the gypsy act 
is the quartet consisting of W. L. 
Worcester, Jr., A. C. Wingold, R. S. 
Slenr, and R. H. Depue. These four, 
accompanied by W. A. Scott, will sing 
part of the love story of the gypsy 
and his mate.
Esther Lelscli is another member 
of the cast whoso name has not been 
announced heretofore. I-Ier stunts 
have made quite a hit at school as
semblies. 1 The acting is all In panto
mime, with singing and dancing in
terspersed. Kizzle Murdoch and Ed. 
Newman are the principal vocalists, 
and Anne Luria and Warren Kimball 
do the dancing. Caroline Gray wrote 
one of the songs.
The name of the act in which War
ren Kimball stars is "The Dream 
Dancers. Bob Gunder wrote the 
piece, and Durbin Horner will sing 
the story while Kimball dances with 
each of his "dreams, in turn. They 
will be Ruth Aston, in a Bohemian 
dance; Zabelle Davies, in an Apache; 
Anne Luria in a Spanish; and Vir
ginia Peterson, in an American.
The musical act will provide some 
of the best entertainment of the 
show. Ida Waldron and Imelda Rinlcenberger have a violin duet. Eva 
Spencer is to sing Sweetheart 
from Maytime and "S'milin 
Through, the song which has prob
ably proved her biggest hit. A beau
tiful Colonial setting has been consturcted for the act, and the girls 
will wear costumes of the period.
Herb Polesies monologue is entit
led Campus Conditions. His re
cent speech at general assembly has 
given the students a good idea of 
what they may expect from him. 
Campus Conditions contains some 
of the most amusing comments that 
an indulgent alma mater and- a care
free Campus Week have ever given 
rise to. Herbs humor is bound to 
go over with a- bang, if the bits we 
have heard are a fair sample of the 
rest.

KILTIE BAND TO CAPER
THURSDAY AFTERNOON
(Continued From Page One.) 
on for the R. O. T. C. Guard Mount.
The climax of the good times the 
band has had this year will be reach
ed on Thursday night of Campus 
Week, when they will have their an
nual banquet at the Ruskin Apart
ments. This is to be the most hilar
ious party of the season, and every 
member of the band is urged to at
tend. The invitation is heartily ex
tended to Alumni band members, who 
should make reservations with Dave 
Garber if they wish to attend.
Its here again! What say you 
Alumni? Are you all set for Cam
pus Week. Of course at this late 
date, we know that all who decided 
to return to the "Old Campus have 
arrangements all completed and are 
ready to set out. But we also know 
there are a few who decide at the 
last minute that they cannot resist 
and will pack in haste: and hurry 
back.
As a reminder the first group and 
a guide to the latter, we are giving 
the following last minute ticks off the 
wire from Campus Week Alumni 
Headquarters:
All Pittsburgh alumni are request
ed to register at Alumni Headquar
ters which will be located in the but. 
Leave your Pittsburgh address and 
phone number. This is very impor
tant and should not be neglected by 
any.
A special club room will be provid
ed for men and women in the new 
gymnasium. These rooms are for 
alumni only.
A special section of the dance floor 
will be reserved for alumni at the 
Mardi Gras. Seats will be arranged 
and every possible convenience pos-. 
sible provided to insure the comfort 
of the alumni present.-
Dont forget the time and place for 
the swim. Lets see all the water 
ducks on Saturday morning in the 
pool.
Final dope on the banquet places 
Mr. John L. Porter as the main speak
er and Fred R. Cogswell as toast
master. Mr. Porter. is Chairman of 
the Schools Committee of Trustees. 
His subject willl be, "How high shall 
we build Carnegie? Cogswell is 
well known by most all alumni. He 
is now one of the two alumni mem
bers of the Trustees Committee.
Buddy Overend reports that Wally 
Steffen will be present for the ban
quet.
If you have not secured your ban
quet tickets, make sure that you sign 
up at Alumni Headquarters for a re
servation so the committee can give 
the guarantee to the hotel. Places 
will be provided only for those regis
tered.
Alumni can use busses both to and 
from the banquet. To get back in 
time for the Country Fair, it will be 
necessary to have plenty of trans
portation at hand when the banquet 
breaks up. To enable the Committee 
to provide adequate equipment, all 
alumni should sign up if they plan on 
using bus transportation either way.
According to the latest dope over 
three hundred alumni have made . re
servations to return for Campus 
Week. This surpasses all previous 
figures for other Campus Week cele
brations.

ARTS SCHOOL GRAD. 
DESIGNS POSTERS
Mrs. Cora Scovill is Earning 
a Large Income Through 
Creative Ability
Mrs. Cora Scovill, a graduate in 
poster design of the Art School of 
Carnegie, is realizing an annual in
come of $50,000 through her creative 
ability. Those fascinating and unique 
Patch Posters which have created a 
furore in the advertising world, and 
which you have undoubtedly seen in 
the shop windows on Fifth avenue are 
the creation of this young, attractive 
and ingenious Mrs. Scovill.
After , graduating from poster de
sign, she decided to exercise her la
tent accomplishment by making a 
poster for the actor, Grant Mitchell, 
a friend, who was to appear at* a local 
theater. Alas! Search proved that 
neither the house nor the town af
forded a piece of cardboard big 
enough for her purpose. Casting 
about for materials at hand, Mrs. Sco
vill used a large piece of unbleached 
muslin. This she stretched on a 
frame, but whenshe began to paint 
upon it the effect was discouraging, 
for the paint ran Remembering that 
one could paint on satin, she ran to 
her scrap book and turned out some 
cream-colored satin from which she 
fashioned a face. A bit of brown cor
duroy suggests hair, and since this ef
fect was good, after being sewn in 
place, she ravaged the scrap bag for 
material to make the whole poster of 
scraps. Half a coat and trousers 
were fashioned from some bits of 
checked material, and thus the figure 
was built up, bit by bit. She robbed 
her husbands wardrobe of a collar, 
tie and shirt for adornment. A bit 
of gold ribbon made a watch fob, and 
a hat, tucked in one satin hand finish
ed the concoction.
The enthusiastic telegram from Mr. 
Mitchell, saying the poster had been 
put on exhibition in the lobby of the 
theater, where it was creating excited 
comment and asking that she make 
three more posters of other players in 
his company, filled here with bound
less surprise and delight.
After finishing these posters, the 
idea lay dormant for several months, 
until a friend suggested that depart
ment stores might be interested in 
Patch Posters as a means of display
ing new merchandise.
With her energy coupled with her 
enthusiasm, she soon introduced her 
new art in eastern circles. Today she 
has nine manufacturers and many de
partment stores on her list of clients.
She took three weeks to make her 
first order, for which she received 
$350. Now, in her New York studio, 
with the help of her modest staff, 
Mrs. Scovill turns out from two to 
four posters a week for which she 
receives $400 to $650 each, depending 
upon their size, and number of figures 
represented.
