Boys* Glbs One of Most Effective Weapons in 
War Against Crime
By WILLIAM EDWIN HALL, President Boys Club Federation.
- Crime cannot be cared'by . the enactment of new laws.-The 
trolling cause oi our present crime wave lies in .the failure of .oiir 
pie to recognize that tbe piling up in cities .of humanity, in tenements 
and four-room houses, withcat yards provides &.menace to .boys that must 
lw met. Congestion has destroyed the play placea of boys. -Their spare-, 
time energy has no outlet, especially in the after-supper period.
. I hopo that the business menv of .ibis country-wili begin-to use 
same principles that they. apply if their manufactured products 
coining through with flawsnamely, to see that the Taw materia! is of the 
proper quality. -The cure for crime lies in the raw material from which 
our citizenry is made. The. boye club as an agency to reduce crimi 
pays.'rich dividends, to the, community. v rThe hoys club, where-a hoy may.nieet his gang every night' in th< 
gameroom, gymnaeinm, library and vocational, classroom,-play . his . way. 
under trained supervision into 'good citizenship, is a real-weapon - with 
which to fight crime: - 
Mankind Constantly Engaged in the Procs? 
? of Character Building
By PHOF. C. TOISON HRRCK.-nivraity.of dhicago.
The brain of man has developed slowly out of the brain structure 
\of lower-animals.' .
I have traced' this progression, from the flehea and amphibians, 
through reptiles, birds and manunaln. .But spmewhere.'in. the history- of 
primate evolution an elaboration has talren place, leading, to the facilita
tion of rapid'learning and thinking. .. V '" 
There .is no. truth, in the, old'theory that man is a puppet whose 
acts axe foreordained from without his own .personality. Man is engaged 
in character-building a!s a'purposeful enterprise, and his own fore. knowledge of prbbable' future conaeqiiences of his actions is a strictiy 
biologi.cal-process in one of .its 'aape'gts. - 
.. We have -found.place iit our.'QationBl system for. purpose imagina 
tion, appredation.' aentiment, ethics,' ietigioii- faitlf,' hope:and' charity.. 
I need/these things'in the serious.business of. living and I find pragmaticr 
ally that .in proportion as.they are integrally, woven into my life as; 
whole*, this life develops in satisfying patterns.

If it Tfrere not for the old fogiea. hostile to new ideas, the problem of 
tracing the'descent of iiian'wbhld be an eai'
It, is tbe new crop of-young people who aro willing to accept that t 
which the older generation ehout .,'treas6n." Although they demand the 
proof for.everything they hear they are always, ready to. listen, which is 
the, fair attitude. '-.
. We write arb'cles stating that.the Indians who inhabited this 
try .were, descended from the Chrnese, and-exhibit specimens of hair of 
both rSces, exactly identical. What do.es'the average man do? He hits been

THE HY DRIVE
 Teaterday the T. "W. C., A, and the Y. M.-C. A. 
opened their.annual membership drive. As ac
tive- committee -. is canvassing the entire student 
-body for new. memberships to these orgsniza^tionfl. The ,MY hopes this year to have for, the 
first time one hundred per cent enrollment on the 
.Carnegie. Campus; .
, The excellent work of the Y is at first not 
glaringly apparent, but after a few. moments of 
consideration its activities and possibilities take 
on huge proportions.
. Every fall,' when the freshmen with their so
cial, racial; economic end moral differences, come 
upon our campus, the problem of passing on to 
them as a group and as individuals wholesome 
appetite?,; attitudes and ideals is a. tremendous 
one. With this problem to face, Dean Green.and 
Dean Tarbell -turn .to the -Young "Womens, and 
Young Men-s Christian Associations, the two out
standing organizations, for help in crystallizing 
the highest type of living in-our new students.
 Th Y-' pioyidfcs-dean,'-wholesome entertain
ment for the students during their stay at Carnegie, thereby-.offaetting many of:the evils which 
naturally beset the college student. Each year 
the. students anticipate with great zeal the many 
stags,.smokets, an& interesting lectures that the 
Y provides. -This .is only one phase of the 
Y'sV activities. .They arc so multitudinous in 
scope and of. such high caliber that were'they 
suddenly to cease, th .dampus would indeed rea
lize their great worth.
To exist,, the Y mu6t. depend entirely upon 
the so-called generosity of, the entire student 
body.. However, a membership card in one of 
these organizations means something far more 
significant .than mere generosity. It is an invest:
. ment. A mighty important inyestment. Th 
Y. belongs, to you.. lit is your organization, 
controlled by your, representatives. It is one 
definite way jfou have of building up a greater 
and finer' Carhgi. ; -

THE COE COLLEGE COSMOS ,
.A college demands' a freshman class -.vhoae .members\ara not handicapped by inherent llmltatlons.or de

the college,Student . Report. :- -.y'-'-
THE FRESHMAN: NVA81N .
Again the .Invading hosts are upon
9 A vast-and. uncouth riuy of freshmen are .seeking ntrnce lnto wailed city: Perhaps It Is the Jty of knowledge. At any rate they clamoring fr admlssloi and tho price theypay. for it'is adyice.
' Thus tbe open, season .for. advice; giving is also' upon us. College prsi; 
denti/, -deans, professors, student Icad^ ers, editors, and Creek captains, pouring out advice enough these Oc
tober days tp. inflate all the dirigibles that have .ever been built.
Ajid sfiorali the shouting lias died awaywill anything havo beez 
compllshed? We doubt it This impulso to gjve counsel to ,the Incoming freshman is based oii'the fundai tal fallacy that the froshman undergoes a great and . sudden change' as soon as he matriculates t collga. It 
is' academic alcheiny .and 'it Is pre- posteroUB.
Tho deans may tell him that he entering' upon an ntlrel new kind 
of life. The rusblng delegatee maj tell him'what anextraordinary fellow be Is, when be knows fiill well that he Is.only mediocre. His head 
may bulge but deep within h knov that tills stuff , is essentially bunk- just as everyone else knows it is.When the colleg community he Bettled down to normalcy : It Is .discovered that there Is no perceptible change in :the3e newcomers, 
high school ' booster- has merely be- come the college booster. The senloi swell-head baa only changed into s freshmiin smart-aleok. Tbe timid, hesitating and embarrassed boy I merely one more added to that vas 
apathetic throng.
College Is a developing processed like evolution .very slow one. It works no mtfacles even though you may' believe In them. That 1L why the orgy of advice we are wltneasln has sd little effect, and why the ne' student arrives at a period of bitter 
disillusionment after a few weekb ol college life ' have passed. For works the other way. The freshen finds that college professors like high' school tcachers can 'be unfair ai reasonable and unrelenting. He dlB covers that students talk' moBtty about football and dates Just as did back born,' and -paddles take th place, of praise.
Only when we realize that th slow development of the - student 0 curs over 'a period of four yeari our words -become reasonable and li deed Intelligible. Gradually the student drops eotne of those '.prejudices acquired in high school. He doeB .not abandon them all. That is ealting much' of him. He always bas a 1 ply on, buid, ': Biit  new Ideas, new attitudes trickle in. -. He cannot escape them, unless his; bead is impervious: ' Hli capacity us a student is !detenhine.l by bis ability to assimilate new thought; and 'ellmiha.Le! the- old.
Sometimes a double tragedy occurs In college. The student is unable rid hlmBelf of old superstitions and bllud beliefs. This Is a clear ct suicide. But on the otfier hand, the college may stifle the'bursting life 
and the' courageous enterprise In student This is palpably murder.Lee there, be no tragedies'on o campus tbls'year.THE PITT WEEKLY
