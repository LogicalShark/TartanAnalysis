(By E. C. Fraz.!er.)
Twenty thousand yelling, cheering 
football maniacs packed the stands 
and overflowed into the field at Lit
tle Washington "Saturday and saw 
Carnegie'Tech deprived of a glorious 
victory over W. & J. by the narrow 
margin of one well placed field goal. 
In one of the fiercest gridiron battles 
seen this year, the Presidents sub
dued the Plaid by the score of 9 to 7.
Thirty-six carloads of rooters, most
ly Tartans, journeyed from Pitts
burgh and saw a light, courageous 
and exceptionally well-coached eleven 
baffle the heavier, more highly touted 
outfit of W. & J. and score the first, 
touchdown of the game before the 
end of the first quarter.
It was a dumbfounded, confused 
Black and Red contingent that had 
found itself swept back and still fur
ther back, right into the shadows of 
their own goal-posts. It was a tri
umphant. Slcibo army that outwitted 
and outfought the enemy right up to 
the zero marker. Here, the Presi(Continued on Page Three.)

At last the New Alma Mater has 
arrived! Vic OBrien is writing the. 
score for the different instruments 
and it will be completed in time for 
the band to play it at the Big Rally 
today.
It has taken a great deal of effort 
to get the music for the band in time 
i for it to be played at the Pitt game. 
Much of the credit is due to Vic 
OBrien who has worked hard to get 
the different scores ready for the 
band.
The band is going to play the New 
Alma Mater at the Big Rally today 
lets see everybody turn out to learn 
it today so that everybody can sing 
it at the Pitt game.
The College Womans Vote
At 12:30, Wednesday noon the 
League of Women Voters will have 
their first meeting in conjunction with 
the Y. W. C. A. in the Recreational 
Hall of Margaret Morrison. Miss Mil
dred Lucas will talk on the subject of 
"The College Womans Vote. Come 
and discuss the problem with her 
since election day is close at hand. 
Let us see you there.
This is a new organization at Car
negie and is a part of the Pittsburgh 
League. At the last meeting held in 
the spring the following officers were 
elected: President, Mildred Lucas;
vice president, Esther Johnston; sec
retary and treasurer, Mrs. Julia Staniland and publicity and historian, Vir
ginia Pope.
Invitations From Faculty 
Are Ready and Will be 
Distributed Sometime This 
Week
BRING YOUR DAD HERE
DEAN BROWN TO TAKE 
CHARGE OF Y. W. MEET
Dean Brown will have charge of the 
Y. W. C. A. meeting in the Margaret 
Morrison Recreation Hall tomorrow at 
12:20. The meeting promises to be 
a most- interesting one.
The tea which was given for the 
Advisory Board last Wednesday af
ternoon was a delightful event and 
very well attended. It was the first 
time that the new Advisory Board and 
the Y. W. C. A. as a whole have met 
together.
Informal descriptions of the things 
that have been done by the Carnegie 
Y. W. and of the plans for this year 
were given by various members for 
the benefit of the Advisory Board and 
the new members.
Preparations for Fathers Day are 
well under way, and if anything can 
be judged from the enthusiasm of the 
committee, the day Is going to go over 
big. Printed Invitations from the ad
ministration have been printed and 
will be distributed to the students 
within the next few days. The com
mittee asks that every student sends 
one of these Invitations home as soon 
as he receives it. Just put it in an 
envelope and send it; nothing elso in 
the way of explanation is requirod. 
The idea is that the invitation is com
ing from the administration of Car
negie Tech and is addressed personal
ly to each students Father and 
Mother.
The program has boon practically 
worked up, and one of the high spots 
is an entertainment which will bo put 
on in the Commons by somo of the 
Drama students. You can imaglno 
which ones! All the final details will 
be printed in next weeks Carnogle 
Tartan. Nothing now remains but to 
get the Fathers here.
And that Is the job of every indi
vidual student. If you havent written 
home yet, youre pretty slow, and you 
should do It at once. We must have 
a large number in order that the idea 
may be effective. The city students 
in particular have no excuse for not 
having their parents here all day, and 
unless your people live over a thou
sand miles away, they should be here.
years.
Athletic relations between the two 
big Pittsburgh schools were discon
tinued after that memorable after
noon in November, 1919, when the 
fighting Tartans gave the highly tout
ed Pitt aggregation of staiB the scare 
of their lives in as strenuous a game 
as Pitt cared to play. The game was 
so hard fought, and the rivalry be
tween the two student bodies was so 
intense, that a near-rlot ensued be
fore the game was over. This unfor
tunate occurrence was the cause of 
the cessation of contests botweon the 
schools in all branchos of sports, much 
to the loss of the schools and the fans 
of the city.
It is hardly necessary to say much 
about that historical game. Every 
true Tartanlto knows how the Skibos 
fought that day, never lotting up for 
a moment against thoir worthy foos. 
They remember well how "Phil Mar
shall grabbed a forward pass out of 
the air and raced 93 yards for tho first 
touchdown of tho frame; how Pitt had 
started with Several of thoir groat

TALKS BEGIN TODAY
DRAMAT SEASON TO 
OPEN WITH MAGDA
Beauty Talks Have Been Neglected 
But at Last Theyre Resurrected
There must be some question about 
the matter of Beauty on our Campus, 
for there is daily comment on the 
subject. Some sophisticated Senior 
sees sloppiness slinking in some sweet 
sorority sisters slender shape, and at 
the same time plenty of peppy Plebes 
peruse promiscuously, promenading 
Pollyanas, proceeding phrom place to 
place, picking phlaws with their pliysiogonomies. That must not be. Eith
er the Plebes are too young and care
free to note whether or not they are 
speaking the truth about the pretty 
pharies, or else the Seniors have seen 
too many in their five year term, to 
become enthused over an average look
ing person. That is the reason for 
this bit of Beauty argumentwe 
should have girls above the average.
Just because Carnegie Tech girls 
are just as pretty as those from any 
other college, is no reason why they 
should be satisfied to sit by and be 
admired. They should be on the
jump, trying to outlook those from 
other colleges, as it were. Each girl 
who has not tried our Mirror stunt, 
had better run right away and look to 
see whether she could be more at
tractive as a Glorious Swanson type, 
or whether Mae Murray would suit 
her for a type to followmost of the 
girls apparently think Mae Murray Is 
the last cry in dancing apparel, judg
ing from Campus affairs.
To follow up what has been said 
previous to tho outbreak of the 
Wrathful Maggie Murph," It would be 
wise for each girl to develop a per
sonality. Beauty may be only skin 
deep, and some may have been 
skinned in their youth, but a pleasing 
personality goes clear through, and 
cannot be uprooted. Get a mirror 
fixed in your minds eye, and look Into 
yourself, to see what your personal
ity looks like, and then try to Improve 
upon it, for it is sure that there Is 
room for a change for the better.
Possibility of Joint 
Junior Prom Noted
Announcement Made of New 
Committee Selections j
There has been a great deal of dis
cussion among the Junior classes of 
the four schools concerning the ques
tion of combining the Mens and Wo
mens Junior Prom this year.
Those who are not in favor of this 
move, argue that a much larger 
ballroom would necessarily have to be 
secured that it would be impossible 
to hold it within proximity of the 
campus, thus causing a noticeable in
crease in taxi fare.
Those who believe this possible 
union to be a good thing, feel that 
with the combined effort of the four 
schools a much finer, bigger, and 
more successful Prom could be put 
on.
Nothing has been definitely decided 
concerning this question except that

Tho opening of tho Little Theater

S'udermanns powerful drama will be 
presented by the Department of 
Drama under the direction of Hubert 
Osborne.
Magda was first played in Berlin in 
1890 and immediately placed its au
thor in the foremost ranks of Euro
pean dramatists. The title role offered 
such possibilities for emotional acting 
that it was played by Bernhardt, Re
gene, Mrs. Fiske, Mrs. Patrick Camp
bell, Olga Nethersole, and Nance 
ONeil.
Although the play is now thirty-four 
years old it has lost none of its emo
tional appeal as was proved by its 
success when it was revived in London 
last spring with Gladys Cooper, known 
as the most beautiful woman on the 
English stage, in the leading part.

Over Two Thousand Students 
Attend Night Classes
The official figures for night reg

and are of interest to the whole stu
dent body. Night school classes have 
always been a part of the policy of 
Carnegie Tech, but the registration 
figures this year far exceed any pre
vious figures. In this connection, the 
Interest which night school students 
have this year shown In Carnegie acfivites by buying over five hundred 
books for activities is Illustrative of 
the goodwill which night students 
bear towards Carnegie Tech, and em
phasizes the fact that night students 
are just as truly Carnegie men and 
women as are those In the day school.

WATCH YOUR STEP !
hi the Jla-ll of 1919, Carnegie Tech met Titt on the football field.
The events oi! that clay wore a follows:
A (lyecl-in-l;he-wool Carnegie Tech student body was there, pre
pared and determined to put across a victory.
A great Carnegie Tech football team was on the field.
A Carnegie Tech standard was flying from the flag pole (having 
been placed there in the mysterious quiet of the night before by a 
misled Carnegie Tech student).
During the game, Phil MarKhall, Plaid fullback, intercepted a 
forward pass, and ran 95 yards for a touchdown.
Between halves, a fight occurred, inspired by Carnegie leading, 
and certain irresponsible Carnegie students pointing with derision to 
the Carnegie Tech. standard flying at the top of the flag pole.
Police interference broke,up the fight, and certain students were 
carried to the well-known hooscgow.
Eventually, Pitt won the game, 17-6.
Btiiits not the events of a day that countits often the result 
that hurt. This is true in almost nil cases. Events may happen, and 
pass, and never be remembered, IF there are no attendant results. 
And so it was in this case. The results of this display of unsporlmenlilco tactics was a breaking oil! of relations between Carnegie Tech 
and Pitt.
And so it has boon for three years.
Put this year Carnegie Tech again meets Pitt on the football field.
Whats going to lid tlm result'/
This and nothing else: A keen student rivalry both on the
field and in tho stands, and its going to be a perfect display of 
spirited, friendly and clean sportmanship.
This we know, because both Carnegie Tech and Pitt havo learned 
their lesson, and learned it well.
Another thought might be mentioned. For by your thoughts 
and actions, so you will bo .judged.If I. do things that 1 shouldnt, 
and speak words which are not clean, X will be judged accordingly. 
And so it is with a Carnegie Tech student body. But, in this case 
il goes deeper. When you act disgracefully when bearing tho stand
ard of Carnegie Tech, not yoursoU! is hurl;, but the name ol! Carnego' Tech. And so, tho plea ol! tho Carnegie Tartan is: Guard
zealously tho name and reputation of your Alma Mater.
\Vo realize that tho student body will do their level best to keep 
order and their spirit confined to clean sportsmanship, bull at the 
same time wo realize that one or two irresponsible men can do a lot 
ol harm, and that oftimos it merely takes the lead ol! one of these 
to precipitate tho whole muss into trouble. Furthermore, one man 
by uttering unsportsmanlike words, can give bad iiupressions ol! the I 
body as a whole, for if the truth be known, it. is not the good that is 
remembered but tho bad.
Carnegie Tech men and women WATCH YOUR STEP at all 
games remember that Carnegie Tech stands for gentlemanliness, 
clean sportsmanship, and friendly rivalry ol! the keenest sort. We 
are proud ol! ourselves in this respect and have a right to be so, 
for we live up to it, and wo will continue to do so in tho future.

The Junior class of Margaret Mor
rison met Monday, October 15, at 1:00 
oclock to discuss and make plans for 
future social affairs. The class re
gretted to hear of Dorothy N. Smiths 
resignation as Social Chairman.
The office of Social Chairman of 
the Junior Class is a very important 
one and it moans hard work and re
sponsibility for the person who holds 
that office. Berenice Rent/., Rose 
Morin, and Ida Flnkel were nominat
edBerenice Rentz getting the great
est number of votes.
Plans were again discussed in re
gard to the Women's Junior Prom. A 
suggestion had been made that the 
women combine with the Mens 
Junior Prom for the reason that there 
would he lesB expense involvedsome 
believing it unnecessary to have two 
Junior Proms on the campus. How
ever, it was generally felt that the 
result of combining would be over 
crowding and tho lessoning , of Mar

Before tho meeting adjourned, the 
date of the Junior Party for the 
Plobos was changed from Wednesday,

were held as a result of these tryouts, 
many new members were accepted 
and at present, tho club boasts of a 
total enrollment of some eighty girls.
The club has great aspirations for 
the coming year and is already hard 
at work on some new numbers that 
are to be used at the first concert 
which is to be be given at Woodlawn, 
Pa., sometime in December.
Last Sunday night at 8:30 in the 
Calvary Episcopal Church, a double 
quartet from the club, composed of 
Eveline Held and Elizabeth McClung, 
sopranos, and Maude Cook and Louise 
Benson, altos, sang several numbers 
at the special service held for Car
negie students.
The executive committee of the 
Glee Club has requested that the 
names of the present officers be pub

men from Design, Engineering or In 
dustries, who write as a side line, 
send your stuff in. If it is accepted 
and printed, you will not only have 
the pleasure of seeing your own work 
in print, but you will have your story 
sent, by means of the Shilling ex
change, to several other colleges. The 
Shilling has a really excellent ex
change, and your work will have a 
wide circle of readers. Publicity is a 
thing no struggling author can do 
without.
Without a doubt, the Shilling is go
ing to be the best this year that it 
has ever been, and all students should 
make a point of reading it, not only 
for the stories themselves, but for the 
new ideas contained in it. Some of 
the brainiest people at Carnegie write 
for this magazine, and what they 
write everyone should read, if only 
for the satisfaction of saying I could 
do better than that myself.
There will be four issues, as usual, 
a fall, winter, spring and summer 
number, and tho price will be the 
same as usual, twenty-five cents. 
Those who havo subscriptions will re
ceive thoir copies in the school mall, 
Those who did not subscribe at the 
beginning of tho term,' will have to 
buy their copies each time the maga

At the Plebe Assembly of October 
16, 1923, held in Science 218, several 
announcements of importance were 
made by Director Frank P. Day, di
rector of the Freshman class, in ad
dition to balloting on officers for the 
Freshman class.
T. N. Griggs, as representative of 
the student council, opened the As
sembly and, after a short talk in which 
he told of Carnegie traditions, turned 
the meeting over to Director Day.
The scant attendance at the assem
bly was regretted by the Director, 
who went on to stress the importance 
of choosing the Department of En
gineering are fully, again emphasizing 
the fact that no decision is necessary 
until the end of the year.
Director Day also announced the 
dates when ratings were due, urged 
the careful selection of class officers, 
spoke a few words on class spirit, and, 
thon loft, R. E. Hughes taking charge 
of tho voting through his capacity as 
Freshman advisor.

written numerous articles and books. 
As a general topic it will be divided, 
so that Wednesday he will talk about 
The New Industrial Day, Thursday, 
"Science in Industry, and Friday, "In
dustrial Democracy. The discussions 
will be in Room 209 of Science, at 
8:30 P. M. No cards of admission will 
be required.
A tentative list of speakers to fol
low Den Kimball at different times 
during the year are such outstanding 
men as Dr. Niels Bohr, Professor of 
the University of Copenhagen, and 
winner of tho Nobel Prize for Physics 
In 1922; Dr. John Ersklne, Professor 
of English at Columbia University; 
Dr. Harry N. Holmes, Professor of 
Ch om Is try at Oborjin, and ProfeSsor 
Alfred Stansfleld, of the Department 
of Metallurgical Engineering, McGill 
University. All of those men are well 
known in scientific and scholastic cir
cles, and their lectures promise to 
bo well worth hearing.
The course promises to be an ex
ceedingly interesting and instructive 
one, offering in its wide range of sub
jects, something of interest to any 
student of Carnegie Tech. The lec
tures will be free, so that no student 
has any excuse for failing to attend 
them. Further announcements of the 
lectures will be made later.
country and the locality, to the world 
in fact, for the records show that 
twenty-one countries are represented 
in the night classes. Undoubtedly as 
many states have furnished their quo
tas. There are many men and women 
who for some reason or another are 
unable to attend the regular day 
school classes, but who are yet so 
earnest in their search for learning 
that they will, night after night, come 
home from a days work in the office 
or factory, eat a hasty supper, and 
go on to spend three hours in class 
rooms, or preparing for recitations.
Not only that, but many of those 
students will continue to come year 
after year, first taking a diploma after 
six years of hard work, then going 
on for two or three years more for a 
degree, often not stopping at that 
point, but going on for graduate work. 
An effort was made to get a list of 
names of men who had done this, but 
it was found that the list was so large
the glory which comes with a college 
career, while his more fortunate 
brothers are oversleeping for eightthirties, he is on the job, and in many 
cases has already completed twohours of work in the shop or factory.
Night school involves hard work, es
pecially if pursued toward a degree,, 
so let us not forget that fact, and ad
mire them so much the more for the 
spirit they do show, and for the GOODOF CARNEGIE TECH, let us remem
ber that we are all Carnegie men and 
women.

Newman Club Plans 
to Have Active Year
Halloween Party for Oct. 28; 
_, Collegiate Imps Play
A vigorous schedule of Newman 
Club activities- was planned for this 
school year at the meeting of the ex
ecutive committee of the club last 
Tuesday evening. The recommenda
tions of the committee for changes in 
the usual club program are to be act
ed upon at the next regular meeting, 
Sunday, October 28, in Cathedral High 
School.
The first fruits of the committee1 
efforts will be in evidence at the Hal
loween Dance on Tuesday, October 
30th. Some innovations calculated to 
enhance the jollity of the occasion are 
to be given prominence that evening. 
Decorations and refreshments have 
been ordered appropriate to the sea
son. The Collegiate Imps will play.
Interest In the Newman Club lan
guished during the spring of last year, 
and it is the intention of the commit
tee to bring back the enthusiasm of 
previous seasons. To that end events 
of exceptional attractiveness are be
ing arranged. It is hoped that an 
evening of the week can be made a 
regular "Newman Club Evening, with 
members always able to rely upon a 
club activity for that date.
FIRST SHILLING DANCE 
IS SUCCESSFUL AFFAIR
On Friday, October 19, the Shilling 
gave a dance in the Union, which last
ed from niue till twelve. The Col
legiate Six furnished the music, which 
was greatly appreciated by the Terpslchorean devotees. The chaperones 
invited were Miss Mnry Louise Brown, 
Miss Hazel McKee, Mr. Crompton, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick.
There was a nice crowd in attend
ance, and about ten oclock, Cy I-Ioen 
niger appeared on the scene and con
ducted a little peppy cheering, just 
to get everybody in shape for the next 
days game. There was a great deal 
of spirit shown, and everybody had a 
fine time.
Altogether, socially and financially, 
it was a very successful affair, and the 
Shilling is to be congratulated.
WILL OPEN VALET 
SHOP FOR STUDENTS
Clothes Will be Called for 
Three Times a Day; 
Quick Service
Its here at last! That for which 
we have been waiting. The deed was 
done yesterday morning when Dick 
Cutting opened the Student Valet 
Shoppe, one of the most daring at
tempts to improve our personal ap
pearances ever staged on this cam
pus.
The Shoppe is located in the base
ment of McGill Hall and is equipped 
with a modern. steam -pressing ma
chine. In addition to this the Shoppe 
will maintain a shoe shining parlor, 
laundry service, and mending service. 
Clothes will be dry cleaned, sponged, 
pressed and mended in the Shoppe, a 
competent tailor having been engaged 
to do the work.
The main feature of the Shoppe is 
the lightning speed delivery service. 
Three trips a day will be made to 
each fraternity house. One trip will 
be made early in the morning, anoth
er trip late in the afternoon, and the 
last trip at night. Clothes collected 
on one trip will be sponged, pressed 
and delivered on the return trip. 
Trips will also be made to the girls' 
dorms. Special calls can be arranged 
by phone. Collections will also be 
made for shoes to be shined.

SKIBOS AGAIN TO CLASH
WITH BLUE AND GOLD
(Continued From Page One.)
7-0 score, and Coach Warner had to 
rush in his strongest lineup in order 
to stave off defeat, and how it was 
Hastings and Davies great work 
which finally gave the Blue and Gold 
their hard-earned 17-7 victory; how 
quiet the Pitt stands were during the 
first half when their team was trail
ing, but how our boys wrere cheered 
from the Carnegie side even in de
feat.
Those things are only memories 
now, and the game Saturday 
will mark a new era in Pitt and Car
negie athletics. The keenest and 
cleanest sort of rivalry now exists 
between the two schools. Last fall 
when Pitt licked Wasli-Jeff, the Pitt 
students paraded on the Tartan cam
pus and Pitt and Carnegie were 
roundly cheered by both student bod
ies. Further, the Tartans have made 
rapid strides in the football world in 
the past four years, and are now se
curely perched in Class A football.
The sale of seats for the game has 
been going like wildfire, and indica
tions are that a record crowd will 
pack Forbes Field.

The campaign committee has re
ceived approximately 400 pledges 
from less than one-half of the student 
body. Judging from this response the 
goal should be reached in record time. 
The pledges are payable at the Y. M. 
C. A. office, or to one of the commit
tee on or before the first of Decem
ber.
Considering the value of the Y. M. 
C. A. as an aid to the general student 
body, and especially to the members 
of the incoming class, there should be 
no hesitancy in giving support to this 
campaign.

The construction of the Long Key 
viaduct on the Florida East Coast 
Railroad was described by Mr. Wm. M. 
Venable in an illustrated lecture be
fore the Civil Engineering Seminar 
last week. The project was started 
and carried on by the railroad com
pany to establish rail communication 
between Key West and the mainland. 
The work was carried on in the face 
of such difficulties as hurricanes, 
which caused large loss of life and 
property, labor troubles, rum-running 
and hostile mosquitos.
The survey lines were established 
from one key to the next.. Then a pile 
driver, using a round steel pile broke 
holes through the limestone crust cov
ering the bottom. Wooden piles were 
then driven into tlie softer rock be
low. The positions of the piers were 
located and cofferdams were spotted 
by barges, one on either side of the 
right-of-way.
Following these barges was the con
crete barge. The concrete was mixed 
on the barge and poured into the cof
fer dams by means of tubes which put 
the concrete directly on the bottom 
without mixing with the sea water. 
The bass was poured first, then small
er forms were placed and the piers 
were poured. The reinforcing was 
also put in at this time.
After the concrete in the piers had 
set-other barges placed the arch forms 
and the arches were poured. This 
completed a monolithic structure in 
which no allowance was made for ex
pansion. The present condition of the 
viaduct has shown that no such provi
sion was necessary.
Mr. Venable, member Am. Soc. C. 
E., was actively engaged in the con
struction of this viaduct. He is at 
present manager of the Production 
Department of the Blaw-Knox Com
pany.

OPEN EVENINGS
Next Saturday Carnegie Tech meets 
the University of Pittsburgh at Forbes 
Field in a game which marks the re
sumption of football relations between 
the inter-city rivals after a lapse of 
three years.
A gridiron aggregation representing 
Carnegie has never been able to down 
the Panthers. Warner has always de
veloped a wonderful football machine, 
and the team this year is no excep
tion to the rule, bear stories to the 
contrary notwithstanding.
Things are happening around Car
negie, however, which never happened 
before, andwell, we may have some
thing coming to us, thats all. But 
regardless of the outcome of the 
struggle, both teams are going to 
know that they have a battle on their 
hands before the final whistle brings 
rest.
Well, after having seen both teams 
in action this year, it becomes appar
ent that we have the dope fairly 
straight. Yes, Pitt was beaten a week 
ago last Saturday by West Virginia; 
but the score does not indicate by any 
means that Pitt has a weak team 
not by a jugful. The game was a 
thriller, nip-and-tuck throughout. But 
why all these bear stories? Simply 
to shake out the notion existing in tho 
minds of many on the campus that 
Carnegie Techs hardest game does 
not come next Saturday. On the con
trary, Carnegie Tech is going to fight 
harder than ever to win, for undoubt
edly this game is uppermost in the 
minds of the student body, and a vic
tory would be warranted cause for 
unbounded rejoicing.
Are the efforts to win this game 
going to bo confined to' Comfort, Rob
ertson, et al? Absolutely not, for 
every Tom, Dick, and Mary is going 
to support the team as never before. 
This is necessary, for what joy would 
a victory on the field mean if our 
rivals beat us off the field in cheering, 
singing, and general support? Pitt is 
noted for her cheering, singing, and 
band as well as for powerful football 
teams; and this was never more ap
parent than at that West Virginia 
game. Just note!
When the team was behind in the 
score, did the cheer leaders rest on 
their megaphone? Wrong guess, for 
cheer after cheer went out to the boys 
on the field, and who can deny tho ef
ficacy of such spirited support? Be
tween the halves, the students sang 
school songs accompanied by the fa
mous Pitt band, and undoubtedly those 
signs of spirit spurred the players 
to make their first touchdown.
So it was, all through tho game; tho 
students were ever on their toes. 
Mark thisthe ontire student stands 
woro filled early, early enough to seo 
tho entire Freshman preliminary 
game. Immediately before tho varsity 
game, the band paraded in front of 
the students who stood in respoctful 
attention, singing school songs to its 
accompaniment. On tho kick-off, tho 
students arose as one and gave tho 
team a rousing cheer. When signals 
were boing called, not a voice was 
heard, but a mighty cheer went up as 
a Pitt halfback started around tho end, 
or made a gain off-tackle.
You havo the dope, you know what 
to expect, so get out your student 
book and sit in the student section, 
study or review the cheers and songs, 
clear your throat for action, and af
ter you have done all this, your con
science will be clear.  So be there and 
YELL!

spirit, and if spirit wins the game, 
they wont see us for dust.
The Plaid has always been blessed 
with a wonderful sincere spirita 
spirit that many of our rivals envy. 
And we are proud of it too. Were 
glad that we are at a school that 
fosters such a spirit, and to keep up 
the standard, we got to do our part. 
So yell, you fellows, yell until youre 
blue in the iace, and as hoarse as 
an alligator. It doesnt matter 
whether youre hoarse Saturday night, 
because you'll talk to her in a whis
per anyhow.
And sing that new Alma Mater, 
too. Pitt has the same tune as our 
old one, so here is a chance to show 
some individuality. If you dont learn 
it, and co-operate with the * rest of 
the crowd, the whole thing will turn 
out ker-smash, a complete mess. 
And thats something we dont want. 
No fizzles or flukes that day. Every
thing is going to run off in a smooth, 
organized fashion, as is done in 
every class A college. And were 
going to come out good and strong, 
all pepped up and feeling fine, de
termined to support the team to vic
tory. The team needs you're individ
ual help. Come across, do your 
share and the twenty-seventh of Oc
tober will never be forgotten. We're 
backing up the team with only one 
idea in mind, Paint Pitt Plaid.'*
One more thing! Get to Forbes 
Field earlynot later than one 
o'clock, to see the Plebes play the 
Pitt Freshmen. Thats going to bo 
a knockout of a game. We all want 
to see it. Those Plebes are going 
to fight just as hard as the Varsity, 
and surely deserve a proportionate 
amount of student support in the 
way of cheering. The alumni of Car
negie Tech are asked to take Sec
tions 14, 15 and 16. The student 
body will gather along first baso-. 
Our seats are practically the choice
The Plaid cross country season is 
rapidly coming to a head for Coach 
Halferty is pushing his men hard for 
an opening practice meet on the af
ternoon of October 26, when the P. 
A. A. and Pitt harriers will try the 
speed of the Tartans. In tho weeks 
following, will come the real tests: 
The Plebe squad is also showing 
some speedy men and so far three 
meets have been arranged for them. 
The meets are as follows:
October 26Pitt FreshmenHome 
Course.
October 31Sacred Heart High 
Home Course.
November SPittsburgh Division 
P. R. R.Home Course.
This will give the Plebes a fine

also to win their numerals.
DINNER RALLY
Dont forget the Dinner Rally to
day.
The M. M. C. C. Athletic Associa
tion is holding a dinner rally tonight 
in the cafeteria to which every girl 
in the school is invited.
There will be speeches by Dean 
Breed and Miss Russell. Those of 
of you who heard Dean Breed speak 
at last years rally know what an in
teresting speaker she is.
Stunts will be given, either by the 
members of the A. A. Board them
selves, or by some representative se
lected by them. These will consist 
of recitations, vocal solos, funny 
stunts and music by the Stringers.
After the dinner there will be some

Be sure and come, for an interest

FALL TENNIS MEET IS 
DOWN TO SEMI-FINALSOn the Plaid Screen
E. C. FRAZIER
The fall tennis tournameut has been 
watched with a groat deal of inter
est, and there has been much discus
sion around tho campus, about tho 
different contestants, and who is go
ing to be tho winner1. There woro 
nearly thirty contestants entered In 
the tournamont, illustrating tho largo 
amount of intorest shown. From this 
large tournament we are sure to find 
some good material for our next 
springs tennis team.
Those that won tlie first round 
were :
Meredith Def.; Pratt, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2; 
Jennings, 6-2, 6-2; Davidson, default; 
Wolf, 6-4, 6-1; Simpson, 6-4, 6-1; Coover, 6-0, 6-1; Nemick, 6-3, 7-5; McWil

Sandburg, 6-1, 6-3; Davidson, 6-2, 6-0; 
Van Atta, 6-1, 6-3.
Those that won the second round 
were :
Pratt, 6-3, 6-4; Wolf, 6-2, 7-9, 6-4; 
Coover, 6-1, 6-1; Moessner, 6-3 S-6; 
Sandburg, bye.

dents hold momentarily, until Mefort, 
the rangy Tartan end, battered his 
wiayt across for the touchdown that 
electrified the Carnegie stands. The 
extra point was added when the pig
skin traveled from the toe of Cy 
Comfort between the posts as truly 
as though a magnet had drawn it 
there.
'Score, 7 to 0, favor Carnegie, first 
quarter. With this .unfavorable bal
ance against them, tho Wash.-JofC, 
warriors arose in their might and 
before the end of tho half, had 
proved that they wore a great team 
by overcoming tho sovon-point lead.
Showing gront power of attack, 
they swept down into Slcibos territo
ry. With .thirty yards to go, tho Tar
tans held firm. Tho teams lined up 
in tho center of tho Hold, and Cap
tain Wolderquist drew back and 
came through handsomely with a Hold 
goal from placement.
Tho turning point o*f tho game 
came in this period. The homo team 
hero launched tho most powerful at
tack of the game, and tho Plaid, torn 
and battered by the terrific onslaught 
of their heavier opponents, could not 
hold the Presidents in thoir march 
for the goal. It was partly the re
sult of tills condition and partly 
through a break that W. & ,T. was 
able to scoro thoir only touchdown. 
McLaughlin failod to kick goal. Tho 
Presidents again threatened the Car
negie goal in the final period, but 
Avore penalized half the length of the 
field when the ball had been carried 
to the three-yard mark.
No particular player outshone the 
rest. Robertson, Brumbaugh and Me
fort, however, shared most of the 
ground-gaming honors for the Plaid; 
while Amos, West and Weiderquist 
distinguished themselves in the same 
way for W. & J. The lineup:

Tho following representatives of 
the various colleges and divisions of 
tlie Institute wero appointed to the

The Alumni Federation aims to be 
the medium between,tho college and 
tho alumnus; that is, the duty of the 
Alumni Federation is two-fold.
First, the Federation keeps Its fin
gers on tho pulse of tho college ana 
transmits news of any change of con
ditions for better or worse to the wait
ing alumni.
The second duty is complex and in
cludes:
1. Keeping in toucli with the alum
ni and what they are doing.
2. Encouraging the alumni to send 
in criticisms and constructive sugges
tions for the betterment of the col
lege and the Federation.
3. Keeping the alumni interested 
in the steady, upward progress of the 
college.
Therefore, the college cannot af
ford to lose touch with its alumni. It 
must progress along the same lines 
and at the same rate as those divi
sions of the outside worldbusiness, 
commercial, engineering, industrial, 
artistic or scientificwhich it aims to 
serve.
The college should not only keep 
abreast of the times but must grope 
ahead into the unknown and lead the 
way.
Each one of the tasks, outlined 
above, is a man-sized job, and the co
operation of the alumni, thinking, and 
acting collectively, is vitally neces
sary.
Lend your support and watch the 
development of your Alma Mater.

Real Service Must Be Engineered
Many of the men whose names are writ large 
in engineering history are design engineers; men 
like Westinghouse, Lamme, Stanley, Hodglcinson, Tesla, Shalienberger. Their inventions 
have the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of 
productability; which is an involved way, per
haps, of saying that they have the primary 
requisite of all really great inventions: 
Serviceability.
Engineering history abounds in instances of 
near-genius that produced no product, and of 
great developments that never reached comple
tion; and most of these instances are explained 
by the lack, somewhere in the system, of that 
ability to give real Service.
Service, in a machine or a system, or wherever 
you find it, is not there by accident but because 
it was incorporated by men who understood 
what was required and knew how to provide it.
Much more is required of the designer than 
facility in calculation and mastery of theory. 
He must have first hand and thorough familiarity 
with manufacturing operations and with com
mercial and operating conditions. It takes more 
than mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design 
apparatus that will bo really serviceable and 
will stay put."
The design engineer, in the Westinghouse 
plan, is responsible for the performance of the 
finished product. He cannot possibly have the 
proper understanding of operation unless he oper
ates and tests, unless he spends time and thought 
in investigation and study, not in the laboratory 
or drawing room, but right on the operating 
job. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and 
here he will see and prepare for all the different 
things which the product will later have to 
encounter. Then .when he comes to put his 
creations on paper, his calculations will be 
necessary and helpful to check the conclusions 
which he has reached, and this right use of them 
requires training and a high degree of under
standing. This proper balance of the physical 
and mathematical conception of things is what 
constitutes engineering judgement.
It should be thoroughly understood that the 
primary function of the design engineer is the 
conception and the production of new or im
proved apparatus, and familiarity with the 
practical is essential to the proper discharge of 
this duty.
It is this view of designing that makes this 
branch of Westinghouse engineering so impor
tant, so effective, and so productive of real 
developments.

Important Meeting 
Held in Youngstown
Director Connelley Addresses 
Builders Exchange
Director Connelley delivered a very 
interesting address last week before 
the Youngstown Builders Exchange. 
He explained to them the work that 
is being done by the New Industrial 
Relations Department at Carnegie 
Tech,'and the advantages of this work 
in the future. The courses offered 
here in building construction were ex
plained in detail, about which many 
of the Youngstown builders knew 
nothing. They were very much in
terested to know that their line of 
work is being advanced from a theo
retical standpoint as well as from a 
practical.
The Federal Vocation Board of 
Youngstown was also present at the 
meeting. Director Connelley's talk 
impressed them to such an extent 
that they are going to install pre
requisite courses, leading to building 
construction in their public schools 
as well as in the high schools. They 
realized that this will increase the 
cost of running their schools, and will 
reflect back upon tho taxpayers, but 
after considering that for every dol
lar that is spent for taxes, seventeen 
are spent for luxury, they saw that it 
would be money well spent. Further
more, they inquired as to what would 
be the most advantageous courses 
that they could offer in their schools, 
which would lead up to the curricu
lum given at Carnegie, so that their 
boys could advance gradually until 
they had been awarded a degree by 
Carnegie.
'Dr. Connelley was very much inter
ested in the attitude that was taken 
along this line. His next address in 
Youngstown will be before the clan.
