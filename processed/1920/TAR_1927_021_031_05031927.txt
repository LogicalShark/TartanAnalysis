In the taco of these laots, I feel .hat my removal from the editors 
tliair was a hasty and drastic ac- ion. I consider It so Inasmuch as to opporlunty was given me to :hange the policy of Puppet In or? der to rectify features that might 
be considered'Objectionable. , It la to be remembered that no-lssud .of Pupppet- had appeared from. tlie time of my first and only meeting^ with the. Student Council ond the

letter addressed to Mr. Edward McDonald, \ President of the Night

American Gas
What it is~Vihjot it is doing for American Industry **
The-object of the American Gas Association is to promote more and better ways of utilizing gas ;
to assist the industries of America (and the public, as a whole) in deriving-to the fullest the numerous advantages inherent in gas; ..
to advance to the highest efficiency, methods of gas srfanu- factiire, distribution andutihzation;
to collect.and disseminate information on these subjects.
The American Gas Association wos oiganizecl in 1918and con
solidated with the American Gas 
Institute, and the National Commercial Gas Association.
The membership includes 551 Gas Companies, 21 Holding Companies, 423/Manufacturers of gas. 
burning appliances, and 3,444 Individual memberships. Its activities , and interests extend to 
every state in the Umon.
The sales of gas for the year 1926,. officially reported to the Amer-  ican Gas Association, amounted , to 38 biUion cubic feet more than
the amount sold in 1925. This is -twice the increase ui 1925>.over 1924making a total increase of 40% in the last five years.
This phenomenal increase in the use of gas is largely due to the growing demands from industrial customers. < The American Gas Association has recently appropriated half a million dollars . -for research work and development of the industrial gas heating business.

The Trl-SUte - champions and holders of-.oatlo'nai renown were a team, of red-jerslod uearcatB, who vwon seven out of nine starts, end had their goal lie crossed but twice duVlng the . entire season..After- winning tho-usual early struggles with Thiel and Adrian by wide margins', the Sklbos Journeyed to Johpetown, where they received their worst setback of the season. Starting oil with a wonderful brand of . football, they worked the ball, down the field 'and across the W. and J. goal line in the .first few minutes of play. From 
then on. Lady Luck .went against Carnegie, and breaks went to the Red' and Black, who with the-work of Bill Amos, proceeded to beat; by tho Score of 17 to 7, a team which completely outplayed them.The Pitt ,game, regarded as the high epot of. the season, come bn October 23. The. Pittsburgh papers

At the present time,, general bus;

halve continued to slowly fall,, and 
wages have been sustained at a com*, 
paratlvely high level. In the or* 
ary course ot affairs we find 
t wages fell as prices do, bnt not 
raidly. But during the present 
-lod of .falling prices, wages 
have been kept et a mnch higher 
level than would.have been thought 
ble.  The .chief .reasons for. 
the maintenance of high' wages are 
the abundance of capital seeking 
Iment, th restriction of iinml- in and the gresiter efficiency of production.It has been necessary for the manufacturer to economize in .labor result of the fact that there lot 'been the abundant, supply of cheat labor on which he could irmerly depend. European coun- les have not been able to send le larger numbers of immigrants  Ihe United States which they
because of th Immigration laws. Capital, on the other hand, has become more abundant than at any time in the-history ot the country. The result lias beh that the manufacturer-has been.using more cap* Ital for the purpose of making this 
limited supply of labor more efficient, in order that the high wages might be paid.Different specific lines of busiSons And Lovers" ]s consider
