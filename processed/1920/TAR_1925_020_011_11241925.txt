Co-operation of Student Body 
Needed to Inaugurate 
New System
White Studios of New York, spe
cialists in college annual work, have 
been engaged to take the photographs 
for the 1926 Thistle. Plans are being 
made for the pictures to be taken be
tween December 2, and the Christ
mas recess. The schedule worked out 
by the staff is a complete departure 
from the system used here in previ
ous years, but has been used very suc
cessfully by yearbooks of some of the 
larger colleges.
Seniors.
In the past few years considerable 
difficulty has been encountered in get
ting the senior pictures taken without 
serious delay and much inconvenience 
to the students, the staff, and the 
photographer. To obviate any pos
sibility of waiting in line for last min
ute sittings, all senior pictures will 
be taken by appointment.
By referring to schedule cards, the 
senior editor has carefully selected 
the most convenient time for each 
senior sitting. Appointment cards 
will be mailed each senior in advance. 
If, for any reason, it is impossible to 
keep an appointment through changes 
of schedule or other causes, another 
may be arranged by calling Charles 
Craw, Senior Editor, Schenley 9285 
three days in advance. Since the pic
tures are scheduled with a view to 
eliminating waste of time and incon
venience, and still have ample time to 
take a good portrait, it is very im
portant that all appointments be kept 
promptly at the time set. Pictures 
taken last year can not be used. It 
is felt that with the co-operation of 
every senior this plan will be much 
more satisfactory than the hit-or-miss 
schedule followed out in previous 
years.
Simply go to Room 149 Industries 
dressed as you wish your picture to 
appear, present your card with one 
dollar to cover all expenses and the 
photographer will do the rest.

SOPH HOP IS DATED 
FOR NOVEMBER 4th
Ball Room of Schenley Hotel 
is Secured For Big 
Soph Event
ADE IS CHAIRMAN
The thirteenth annual Science Stag, 
the leading event of the Calendar of 
the College of Engineering and the on
ly social event exclusively for engin
eering students, promises to be the 
most original Stag ever held. The 
committee in charge, headed by L. E. 
Smith, consistently refuses to divulge 
the details of its plans. Its very atti
tude of mystery seems to point to 
something unusual.
This much, however, has leaked 
out: in addition to the class and fac
ulty stunts, the alumni is planning a 
stunt. An unverified report points to 
A1 Minetti as one of the participants. 
Bob Waddel has promised to be pres
ent and tell some inside stories of the 
past football season.
The entertainment will be given in 
the - Union. In order to provide clear 
vision from the rear of the room,
special smoke eliminators are being
installed. Directod Mott will lead off 
with a short talk. Bob Waddell 
will follow with a recital of his trou
bles as a coach.
The competition for the cup going
to the class putting on the best stunt
is sure to be keen. It will be remem
bered that it was won by the Juniors 
last year by their clever burlesque on 
assemlbies and chapels. The faculty 
(Continued on Page Two.)
This years Soph Hop has been 
definitely sceliduled for Friday even
ing, December 4th. The Soph Hop 
committee has made arrangements to 
hold the affair in the spacious ball
room of the Schenley Hotel between 
the hours of nine and one oclock.
The Soph Hop committee is well 
under way on the plans for the dance. 
Ben Ade is chairman of the commit
tee. Ben is a member of the Kappa 
Sigma fraternity and is also a mem
ber of the Druids, the Sophomore 
honorary fraternity. The committee 
is composed of the following Sopho
mores: Lucille Galmish, Mary Mc
Guire, Ruth Rodgers, Frank Fingles, 
Richard King, Irving Mack, Meredith 
Stump, Paul Schell, Caleb Hornbostel 
and Morris Perry.
The Soph Hop is the big evont of 
the year for the Sophomores and is 
enjoyed by every one who attends, in
cluding the many upperclassmen. The 
Sophomores have always derived an 
unholy pleasure from this one social 
function, where they may appear and 
the Plebes may not. The Sophs this 
year plan a number of surprise feat
ures. The decorations will not be one 
of the least of these, as the commit
tee has planned on a very novel and 
beautiful scheme for the decoration. 
The favors too are unique and will 
make very line remembrances of the 
hop.
On next Friday and Saturday, No
vember 27 and 2S. the National Thea
ter Conference which is being called 
by President Baker, will be in session 
at Carnegie. The conference hopes 
to solve some of the difficulties which 
are hindering the progress of the 
American theater. Those who are in
terested in the conference hope to un
cover an array of fact which will 
serve as a guide for the regenerative 
forces at work in the American thea
ter.
Otta Kahn, the famous capitalist 
and patron of the arts, who was made 
a member of the Carnegie Tech com
mittee of trustees last year, will rep
resent the Intelligent play goer as 
a speaker on The American Stage: 
Reflections of an Amateur. He is 
interested not only in Carnegie, but 
also in Massachusetts Tech and Rut
gers college.
Mr. Kahn is a member of the bank
ing firm of Kahn, Koeb and Company. 
He is a director of many railroads. 
He is a liberal patron of the arts in 
England and America. He is an hon
orary director of the Royal Opera. 
Convent Garden, London; chairman 
of the Metropolitan Opera Company; 
vice president of the National Phil
harmonic Orchestra, and director of 
the American Federation of Arts.
Foreign countries seem to vie .with 
each other in doing honor to Mr. 
Kahn. He is a comrade of the Le
gion of Honor of France. Spain has 
made him a Knight of the Order of 
Charles II. Both Italy and Belgium 
have made him a grand officer of their 
Orders of the Crown.
The enthusiasm which the confer
ence has aroused is remarkable. Near
ly 75 colleges and universities in 17 
different states and nearly half as 
many community theater groups in 10 
different states, have chosen dele
gates. The interest, however, Is to 
be expected. Sixty-five per cent of 
410 American colleges either maintain departments, or give courses in 
dramatic arts.
Although national in scope and 
ideals, the conference will have an 
international tinge. Richard Bole 
slavsky, formerly associated with the 
Moscow Art theater and now director 
of the American laboratory in New 
York, will discuss The Education and 
Fundamentals In the Development of 
the Actor as a Technician. Dr. Ru
dolf Kommer, Max Reinhardts assistCARNEGIE INSTITUTE
BUYS NEW PAINTING
BY PROF. TAYLOR
A tribute was paid to Professor 
Taylor of the Painting and Decora
tion Department of the Arts School, 
when the 'Carnegie Institute bought 
the painting which s being exhibited 
at the International Exhibition for 
its permanent collection.
Professor Taylors home is in 
Maine. He found his setting upon 
tin estate of Mrs. Read, mother-inlaw of Dudley Miles, a close friend 
of Mr. Taylors. Mrs. Read spent the 
summer in France, and in her ab
sence she directed the custodian of 
tho estate to clear a space in the 
woods for an out-door tea party. Up
on her return the party was given and 
Mr. Taylor was among the guests. 
He was so impressed with the beau
tiful setting that he requested hip 
hostess to give him permission to 
paint the scene. Three days were 
spent in completing the canvas. It 
is full of sunlight and color.
Mr. Taylor has been with the Paint
ing and Decoration Department since 
1911 and at present is professor of 
illustration.

Small groups of men are already fre
quenting the gym in preparation for

This is considered by many as a 
welcome sign. Yet, there are many 
other organizations who have failed, 
as yet, to really jump into the spirit, 
and inaugurate an actual practice. 
Practice periods may be obtained by

Lay Interest in Literary Drama
Steadily GrowingB. Iden Payne
(B. Iden Payne.)
In the following statement Profes
sor Payne expresses hope for the ul
timate attainment of the theatrical 
Idealists fondest dreams:
Of late years it has frequently been 
maintained that real estate interests 
dominate the theatrical situation. 
This is probably no more than a half 
truth, but. as such, indicative of the 
almost universal feeling that reform 
of some sort is necessary.
Whether or not a relaxation of the 
extortions of the rent system would 
effect an improvement in the quality 
of plays produced, there is no quesjtion th?t the pressure of unadulterated 
commercial competition upon the thei ater has made the exploitation of good 
; plays increasingly hazardous, and at 
; the same time the steady growth of 
| Community Theaters, and groups of a
| similar nature, endeavoring to produce 
; intelligent plays intelligently, has 
I gone on with continually stronger mo 
I mentum until It has reached propor! tions little realized by the majority.
| Side by side with this there has 
I been developing, more slowly perhaps 
J but just as steadily, an increasing at 
Mention to the drama on the part of
I Colleges and Universities. All these 
activities cannot but indicate that in| terest in the literary drama Is a grow! ing factor in the national conscious! ness, and in calling the Conference at 
! Carnegie this year. Dr. Baker has 
surely, In the hackneyed phrase, seized

Sophomore Tea Dance 
in Union Tomorrow-4:30
The combined sophomore 
classes will play the role of 
host at a tea dance tomorrow 
afternoon In the Union, between 
the hours of 4:30 and 6:00 p. m. 
The Carnegians, favorite syncopators of a dozen former dances 
of the season, will hold forth 
from the orchestra box.
As usual the male of the spe
cies will be taxed twenty-five 
cents a head admission, but the 
co-eds may crash the gate with
out charge. A crowd Is expect
ed, of proportions that will ec
lipse that of any previous mati
nee affair of the current season, 
because the dance is the last 
campus affair before the gen
eral scattering for the Thanks
giving recess.
The promise of favors, the 
excellent music, and the lure of 
a final fling before hittin fer 
home give advance Indication 
that the Union will be well 
filled tomorrow afternoon be
tween the hours of 4:30 and 
6:00.

With an attendance of 200, tho sec* 
ond annual Institute for the plumbing, 
heating and ventilating industries ter
minated at Carnegie last Thursday,, 
the attendance, though a smaller one 
than present last year, was greatly in
terested in the series of practical lec

institute.
Throughout the sessions, discussions 
were held between the audience and

Thousands of men know this reason for 
the ever-growing popularity of Williams

It is the result of three generations of spe
cializing in shaving soaps. The big tube with

tube containing tiuice as much, 50c.
ALWAYS INSIST ON WILLIAMS
Dr. Herbert Spencer Hadley, chan
cellor of Washington University, St. 
Louis, Missouri, gave tho primary ad
dress at tho thirteenth celebration of 
Carnegie Day, Friday, November 20, 
In the Carnegie Music Ilall on the an
niversary of tho founders birthday.
The invocation was offered by Rev. 
Ooorge Clark Vincent, D. D., minister 
of tho Sliadyside United Presbyterian 
Church.
Dr. Hadley was Introducedy by Pres
ident Baker and after a short ac
knowledgement of his pleasure at be
ing invited to speak on this occasion 
which was for him in the nature of a 
return engagement, be began his mes
sage to Carnegie students.
The immediate past, Dr. Hadley 
uald, Is ihe most remarkably progres
sive period in tho history of tho 
United- States, because it doveloped 
in the space of fifty years, medical 
and mechanical discoveries never be
fore considered seriously. Dr. Hadley 
prophesied that, In the future, we will 
see a concentration and development 
of mechanical skill and power never 
before surpassed.
In the meantime, the present age 
Dr. Hadley characterized as being in
different to the great social and po
litical problems of education and ad
ministration which confront it. It is 
important that the public consider 
these questions carefully for upon 
their wise solution depends the se
curity of tho nation. Americas law 
enforcement lias earned her the name 
of "the most lawless civilized nation 
in the world. Punishment in fifty 
per cent of tho cases prosecuted in 
tho United States is not secured, and 
there Is anywhere from five to ninetylive per cent of inefficiency. A digest 
of every decision handed down in 
American courts would make a set of 
volumes more baffling and intricate 
than those which contained the Ro
man law, of which Gibbon lias said
no fortune could possess nor mind 
digest in its entirety.
America has sought to correct these 
evidences of mai-administration by 
tho initiative, referendum and recall. 
The efforts of the American State Bar 
Association have been unable to raise 
the low legislative standard in all but 
two of our states. Another hopeful 
sign lies in the fact that one-half of 
all state and local revenues aro be
ing devoted to education, which is a 
tacit recognition of the need for pub
lic education.
Dr. Hadley in a stirring peroration 
said that the only hope of the world 
for peace lies In the establishment of 
a world tribunal for international 
law; how elso can tho world bo safe
guarded?

COMMITTEE CHOSEN TO IN
VESTIGATE SENIOR DRESS
Ooorge Murphy, Industries: F. W. 
Cook, Science, and Earl Wheeler, 
Arts School, have been appointed as 
a tiominitt.ee to Investigate the vari
ous types of senior dross that have 
been proposed, The committee will 
announce its1 decision before the 
Christmas holidays.
Tho sentiment, of the Seniors seems 
to bo against the gray foil, hats with 
plaid bands worn last, year and a 
tilmngo will probably bo made. At a 
recent mooting the Arts School Sonlors proposed a cap similar In shape 
to that of tho Druids, in another 
color and with the name "Senior" on 
It, tho Arts Seniors believed It would 
add to thoir dignity and also suit 
their typo of boauty. Another sugges
tion is that canes bo adopted as the 
class Insignia. In favor of this Idea 
is the fact that no other organization 
on tho campus has any similar badge 
of distinction, doubtless for a very 
good reason.
in other colleges interesting meth
ods of honoring themselves have been 
adopted by the Seniors. At the Uni
versity of Florida, the senior class 
has decided to use black derbies and 
canes as a mark of distinction. The 
senior women of the University of 
Southern California are wearing blue 
sweaters with gold numerals.
The committee welcomes sugges
tions, but asks that they be made 
promptly. It is hoped that the chosen 
insignia may be available at the be
ginning of the second semester. 
DELEGATES TO SELF-GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE MAKE 
REPORT TO M. M. ASSEMBLY
Margaret Morrison Assembly today, 
in addition to its usual opening exer
cises conducted by Miss Breed, direc
tor of Margaret Morrison, will include 
in its program a report from the del
egates who attended the Inter-Colle
giate Self Government Association 
conference held at Wellsley College, 
near Boston, Edith Warren, 2(i, and 
Genevieve Connors, 27. Tho Athletic 
Association, under tho direction of 
Mary Quick, will also tnlco part in 
tho program.
PROFESSOR DIBBLE
WILL ASSUME AHRENS
CHAIR IN PLUMBING
(Continued From Pago One) 
in boiler rating, in general, all over 
the country.
The exhibit of Pittsburgh products, 
trade journals and publications and 
inspection trip were also of Interest to 
tho members of the plumbing, heating, 
and ventilating Industries.
As a result of tho innovation of a 
special program consisting of an in
spection trip through Carnegie and 
(lie Art exhibit and lectures by mem
bers of the Margaret Morrison faculty, 
GO women attended the three day in
stitute. The result of this subsidiary 
institute was very successful and will 
be maintained in the institutes of the 
future.
A week of hard labor has been 
completed by the varsity and fresh
man basket ball squads, and much 
towards the development of the men 
has been accomplished. They are 
still in the preliminary stages, and 
will not indulge in any heavy training 
for  another week, when Coach Byerly expects to have the remainder of 
the varsity squad in fold. Those who 
were on either squad last year were 
not asked to report with the new 
candidates, as they would only set 
too fast a pace at the beginning. The 
coach wishes to avoid this. 1-le feels 
that the ones who report first will 
have a much better chance to prove 
their worth, and at the same time 
get into shape and be able to give 
the older men a good light for the 
berths.
Due to the fact that the Tartans 
have lost but one man from last 
years squad, and with the promotion 
oil the ex-freshman candidates, to
gether with1 tho possibility of a man 
making good from the first call, Car
negies chances ,94 having a fine floor 
team are very good.
The schedule is almost completed 
with only a few games not entirely 
settled. It; will be ready for publican 
lion in a few days. So far, the outllno calls for a three-game series 
with Pitt, a duet of games with Penn 
State, Notire Dame, Bucknoll, St. 
Louis, Genova, W. and J. and West 
Virginia. Others, as important, are 
pending, and when tho schedule is 
finished, it. will be a very formidable 
one.
The Freshman schedule will be 
completed in tho near future and 
will I how many attractive engage
ments.
TO TAKE FIRST
THISTLE PHOTOS
DECEMBER 2ND
(Continued From Pago Ono.) 
notice and post on their bulletin 
boards.
The fraternity section of this years 
Thistle will bo on innovation, entirely 
different from thoso of the past years. 
All fraternity pictures will be taken 
as groups in one of the larger rooms 
on the campus. In this way, it Is 
felt ihat. each fraternity will get a 
much better representation in the 
book, in respect to number of men 
and general appearance. By this 
plan, much of the waste of gray space 
which formerly surrounded each indi
vidual picture will be eliminated and 
additional data concerning the frater
nity be inserted: roll of chapters or 
other information. These groups will 
be taken on Sunday, December 13tli. 
Both active members and pledges will 
be taken in the group. If you are a 
member or are pledged to a fraternity 
make your plans to he on hand prompt
ly when the picture is scheduled in 
order that your fraternity may be as
sured of a complete representation in 
the book.
A representative of the Thistle will 
be sent to each house to arrange the 
time for the group. Any suggestions 
that you may give him at that time 
for this section of the book will be 
welcomed. Fraternity members and 
pledges will not be required to pay 
any fee, |fs in the past when sitting 
was necessary but an additional as
sessment of throe) dollars for each 
fraternity will be made to cover the 
oxponses of the whole group.
Organizations.
All organizations, other than social 
fraternities and sororities, will be 
takon as groups at convenient, placoh 
on tho campus. In order that the 
others in your group may not bo cornpelted to wait outside in cold weather, 
it is Important that, you be on hand 
promptly when your group is sched
uled. Presidents of organizations are 
asked to get in touch with Tod Mooro, 
Schenley 9102 for information as tc 
when each group will be taken.
White Studios were selected for 
tliis work because it is felt that their 
work is of a superior quality and with
in your means. In selecting a pho
tographer from so great a distance 
the Thistle Board is taking a risk due 
to the fact that all pictures must be 
taken within a stated time. Delays 
due to adverse weather conditions are 
provided for in the contract but de
lays due to negligence are not. The
To be left behind would have been a | 
calamity. Student Manager "Russ" I 
Roller, better known as "Trophy, j 
had laid his plans wellthe sleepers 
were ready for us, and there we were,; 
put to stay till daylight should pry! 
open our sleep drenched eyes. Be-1 
fore retiring, however, everyone was 
given an apple to eat. None of us 
could see the reason for this, since 
there were no doctor's wives on the 
trainnone that wo knew of. Sleep | 
descended.
Daybreak found us at Indianapolis. 
A dining car was attached While we 
were waiting to pull out, Red 
Grange," whose train was taking him 
to 'Columbus, came out of his car and 
took the air. He wanted to see us 
and find out what he could about our 
brand of football. We told him how 
to beat Ohio Statehe did. However, 
all things must end. His train pulled 
one way, our another.
Breakfast was served and all 
healthy appetites were appeased. Our 
time was now our own, to be spent 
as we deemed best. Some sought 
their books, some indulged in mag
azines, some on bridge games, while 
others were content to set and watch 
the scenery roll by. All were too 
seriously intent up'on the coming 
game, to allow the spirit of levity to 
reign. It may sound odd, but puns 
and wise cracks were conspicuous by 
their absence. Manby, Beede and 
Joe Christoff who represent the most 
unsuppressable punters were as 
solemn as undertakers. Can you im
agine such a state of affairs?
At Terre Haute we were able to get 
off the train and stretch ourselves. 
The town had no restrictions on chest 
expansion and air intake capacities 
so we took our Ml; The train pulled 
on. We noticed that the number of 
the occupants of the car had dwin
dled and feared that we had left them 
at the last stop. An investigation re
vealed them in another car far for
ward. They had located a diversion 
and were enjoying it to the utmost, j Pretty good!
Lunch was served on the diner and 
then the boys settled down to get a 
glimpse of the broad expanse of the 
Mississippi. Word was passed around 
that we would cross it soonand then 
we did. What a disapointment. 
The rived that was presented to our 
view was almost as broad as the Monongaholaand just as muddy. We 
were backed up into St. Louis.
The Coronado Hotel was our hang
out. Ill say that we were quartered 
in style. None of tho modern conven
iences were too good for uswo had 
thorn all. There is no use in talking 
the managers sure did the job up 
brown. It Avas the longest and best 
trip1 ever undertaken, and every detail 
was arranged for.
Tho game was tho next occurrence 
of intorost. it was a hand struggle 
wai.-od on an oven harder field. The 
outcomo need not bo entered here 
It will be found in another column.
In the evening after dinner had 
been disposed of Bull Copper, Bill 
Manby, Alan Cass and Olai Cowan 
felt the call of the weaker sexand 
the dance. These social lions stepped 
out while the remainder of the team 
went to a show. Manby and Cooper 
had a hard time breaking away from 
their Yellow Caband incidentally 
the occupants. Cass and Cowan never 
even made the trainwell hear their 
story later.

CARNEGIE DEFEATS 
ST. LOUIS U. 18-2!On the Plaid Screen
J. A. C. FOLLERj
HARRIERS TROUNCE 
GENEVA RUNNERS
Donohoe and Bastian Score 
For Plaid in LooselyPlayed Game
- Himes Leads Tartans to 27-28
Carnegie administered an 18-2 trounc
ing to the St. Louis University eleven, 
outplaying them at nearly every stage 
of the game, and ringing up 15 lirst 
downs to 4 for the Billikens; the con
test taking place last Saturday in St. 
Louis.
Donohoe and Bastian played a stel
lar game for the Tartans, the former 
scoring the first touchdown, while 
Max scored the last two by spectacu
lar runs in the final quarter. Numer
ous other threats that Carnegie made 
were smothered in the shadow of the 
St. Louis goal.
St. Louis scored first In the opening 
period when the kickoff was fumbled, 
Stanton recovering for St. Louis near 
the goal line. Carnegie held them for 
downs, but the Billikens scored a safe
ty when Bastian missed a bad pass 
from center. The Tartans then 
opened up and started a march down 
the field that finally ended in a touch
down. Donohoe, Beede and Bastian 
starred on this little jaunt, Donohoe 
going over for the touchdown. Car
negie continued to outplay St; Louis 
in tho second quarter but failed to put 
oyer another marker.
Coming out after the half St. Louis 
showed the result of the rest and tore 
through the Plaid defense to the sixyard line. O'Reilly went over for a 
touchdown only to be called back and 
penalized. Thereafter the St. Louis 
attack was smothered by the fast 
charging Tartan line.
The Tartans got going in the last 
quarter and on two spectacular runs 
by Bastian put across two touchdowns 
in quick order. After a 20-yard clip 
by Donohoe, Bastian ran through cen
ter for 30 yards and a touchdown. 
Soon after the kickoff Manby speared 
a St. Louis pass and ran to the 19- 
yard line. On the next play Max 
shook off several tacklers and dashed 
for the final touchdown.
Carnegie showed a clear superiority 
on yardage gained, the tricky offense 
baffling the Billikens time and again. 
The St. Louis team put up a stiff de
fense and turned back numerous 
threats in the shadow of their, goal. 
The sterling defense of the line, the 
flashy running of the backs and the 
great endurance of the team caused 
the 10,000 fans who saw the game, to 
be generous in their praise of the 
Plaid. Disregarding the third period, 
St. Louis showed little to worry the 
Tartans The lineup:

CHALK UP ANOTHER ONE
Last Saturday proved to be a genuine IS carat day for the Institute. The 
football team made another little business trip into the middle west, meeting 
with much greater success than on their previous visit, and both varsity and 
freshman cross-country squads took highest honors.
Training camp weather prevailed at St. Louis and according to various 
members of the team, the ground was as well baked out as Munhall himself 
could have done it, with his little baking machine.
The Missourians played hard, as hard as any team the Plaid has met
this season, and it was not until.in the final quarter that they broke down 
and allowed two touchdowns to be scored against them. In all fairness to 
St. Louis it must be said that they have just completed a schedule that was 
much too long and hard for them, and in addition have lost three first string 
players due to early season casualties. It is interesting to note that on
October 24 they held the Army to a 19 0 count, and that the hitter team de
feated Notre Dame 27-0. Carnegies most formidable lineup turned out the 
good work, and will appear intact against Lehigh next Saturday.
LEHIGH PROSPECTS
That the Tartans will have their hands full in the coming game with 
Lehigh is very evident. Although Lafayette downed the Steel Town boys 
last week end to the tune of 14-0, the quality of the Bethlehem, Pa., aggrega
tion deserved an even more favorable score. The first touchdown was the 
direct result of a blocked kick, and the second marker was made possible by 
a fumble which rolled across the goal line. Year before last, Lehigh defeated 
Carnegie 14-0 at Forbes Field and gave the local fans a surprise. These 
facts assure an interesting game, and one which will see the Plaid at its best.
ABOUT THE W. & J. GAME
Mr. Overends decision on the proposed post-season contest with the 
Presidents has met with favorable comment from numerous critics, selfstyled and otherwise, and the integrity of his action on this matter is very 
evidently beyond question.
THE WEEK IN THE WORLDS SPORTS
(Apologies to Professor Beebe)
Last Saturday morning the Tlieta Xi All-Americans defeated the Beta 
Bull Dogs 19-0. Stars were seen on both teams. In the afternoon the Phi 
Kappas gave the A. T. O.s a lesson in football which the latter paid for at 
the price of 1S-0 F. O. B. as per catalog.
CONFRENCE TO BE FACT-FIND
ING, NOT FAULT-FINDING 
PRESIDENT BAKER
PLEBE RUNNERS END 
SEASON WITH VICTORY
The last of the three meets sched
uled for the freshman cross-country 
team was won from the P. R. R. har
riers last Saturday. The score was
18-37. Campbell, the Plebe ace, led 
the field for the entire three miles and 
breasted the tape in the remarkable 
time of 15 minutes, 52 seconds. Sat
urday saw the course in perfect shape 
and the elements behaving themselves 
nobly.
Quite a surprise was handed the 
Railroaders, who had hoped to defeat 
the Plaid yearlings without much 
trouble. The Carnegie representation 
finished the Schenley Park course in 
the following order: Campbell, Capt.
Allison, Fuller, Haven, Kinney, and 
Fehn.
Shadyside Academy was donated a
19-36 wallop, on Friday of the previ
ous week. Campbell again led the 
freshmen and completed the Academy 
course in 12 minutes and 37 seconds. 
Haven, Capt. Allison, Fuller Fehn, and 
Kinney trailed in to the finish in the 
order named.
Despite the close margined defeat 
tendered them by the Panther Cubs, 
Carnegies freshmen have enjoyed a 
successful season, and have developed 
material which will greatly strengthen 
the varsity squad next year. Manager 
L. E. Krebs requests that the equip
ment be turned in as soon as possible.
(Continued From Page One.) 
that are not likely to be successful 
from a purely commercial point oi 
view.
The little theater movement has 
grown to proportions which tho pub
lic at largo hardly realizes. In the 
universities and colleges there are 
many evidences of a growing interest 
in the drama as literature. Courses in 
playwriting are being given in many 
institutions. Some colleges conduct 
courses in acting and production, some 
maintain in co-operation with tho peo
ple of the town in which they are lo
cated, community theaters.
It is the purpose of the Conference 
to secure as much information as may 
be possible on all these matters. It 
is to be a fact-finding conference and 
we have secured as speakers an extra
ordinary list of competent authorities. 
It includes the names of men who 
have specialized in the work of little 
theaters, in the work of' commercial 
theaters, in dramatic instruction in 
colleges, and finally the names of men 
who represent the point of view of the 
intelligent and cultivated playgoer.
"The delegates who will attend the 
Conference will come from all parts 
of the United State?,, from California 
to New York. While it is unwise to 
talk of tangible results of such a 
meeting, it is our hope that tho dis
cussions will at least help to point 
the way to a further increase of the 
influence of universities and the iittle 
theaters in the production of good 
plays.
"The interest that the Conference 
has aroused among the colleges and 
the little theater groups has greatly 
exceeded my expectations. This leads 
us to believe that the results ot the 
meeting will be ol significant value to 
those who are primarily interested in 
the problems of the little theater and 
of value to the public as well.

PLEBE GRID SEASON
A GREAT SUCCESS
Last September a call was issued 
for candidates for the Plebe football 
team. Coach Anderson received in 
answer to his call a large number of 
men. iSome of these men came with 
a leputation, others had never been 
heard of. Out of this material Jim
my Anderson had to build a team. 
How well he did his job is history. 
Carnegieis yearlings played one c/f 
the hardest schedules a Plebe team 
has ever tackled, and in only one of 
these contests did they fail to win 
the decision. That was the game 
with the Pitt Frosh which ended in 
a 6 to 6 deadlock. In all fairness to 
the Plebes it must be remembered 
that this game was called in the third 
quarter to allow tho dedication exer
cises to get under way.
Tho season opened with English 
and Kousman on ends, and the way 
these men took care of their assign
ments was the thing that made the 
end runs of the Plebes something to 
be feared. On tackle Melzinger, the 
largest man that has been on a Car
negie team for some time, and Mor
row received first call. It was Mor
row that blocked; the punt in the Pitt 
game and paved the way for the Tar
tan touchdown. At W. & J. it was 
Melzinger that blocked another punt, 
that resulted in a victory. Nothing 
further need be said of their worth 
to the team. Deeds of this type 
speak for themselves. Lovewell, 
Young'and Reisinger did most of the 
work at guards. Those boys received 
little of the plaudits of the crowd, but 
made the line the phenomena that it 
was. Together with the center, Cun
ningham, they presented a wall be
hind which the. speedy backs could 
get a good start, and opened holes in 
the oppositions line through which 
the backs had little trouble gaining 
ground.
Tho backlleld presented more of a 
problem to Anderson, not because of 
a lack of material, but in selecting 
the best men for the position. I-Iurrster, Lim ric, Crum, Letzelter and 
Stauffer received first call. Lifric 
was elected captain and played at left 
half. I-Iarp'ster ran the team from 
quarter. This pair formed a triple 
treat which figured in very victory. 
Harpster did the punting, and in many 
games this was one of the deciding 
factors. Crum and Stauffer alter
nated at right half. Staugers rise 
to fame was one of the seasons fea
turing events. At fullback Letzelter 
played a bang up game all times, 
his line plunging and the way he fur
nished interference for the runners 
made him an exceptionally valuable 
man.
There were other men on the 
squad that acquited themselves with 
much credit. Among these were 
Sweet, Rankin and Reisinger. They 
continually forced the regulars to 
play their best.

twenty years ago. The success of 
Miss Hornoman's noted Gaiety Thea 
ter, one of the most.potent factors in 
the stimulation of modern interest in 
the drama, was largely due to Paynes

Victory Around Three 
Mile Course
Carnegie ended its cross country 
season last Saturday by taking over 
Geneva College to the blithesome 
tune of 27-2S. The Geneva harriers 
ran up a dangerously close number of 
points, but this was entirely due to 
the fact that tho course was only 
three and one-half miles long and that 
the Carnegie men were used to fivemile jaunts. Eyewituesses of the race 
say that another mile would have seen 
the Plaid finish in the lead in mass 
formation. The outstanding feature 
of the day was the new record set by 
Lockley, a Geneva man, who ran the 
course in 18:31, Himes of Carnegie 
came in a pretty second. Himos has 
been running away with things this 
season and showed up particularly 
well at the meet. If he keeps up this 
stride next year, he will be the logical 
man to appear at the Intercolllegiates. 
Kints of Geneva finished third closely 
followed by Hobe and- Captaiii Peck 
who finished in the order named. The 
remainder of the Carnegie team fin
ished as follows: McNair, Ewing,
Saulkin, and Lustenburger.
The victories of this year have not 
been especially numerous or brilliant 
but considering the fact that all tho 
men were quite inexperienced tho 
showing has been very creditable. A 
promising Plebe team of this year 
along with the Varsity, all of whom 
will be running next season, will form 
a team that will make the best of 
them look to their honors.
Manager Ed. Wright states that a 
good booking is being made up for 
next season, which will include Le
high, Georgetown, Geneva, Pitt and 
others which have not been announced 
as yet. The major event of the next 
season will be the making of a runner 
who can represent Carnegie at tho 
Intercollegiates. Dykeman, ex-Carnogie star, first come out for the exer
cise, and with this fact in view there 
may be another satellite in school who 
is hiding his light under a bushel.

THANKFULLIBRARY FACILITIES
In the prospectus oi: our institution we speak 
glowingly ol! the advantages offered Carnegie stu
dents by the proximity of the Carnegie Library 
of Pittsburgh. There is a pronounced tendency 
to allow the library facilities oJ! our own campus 
to be greatly overshadowed. Even the Student 
Handbook make the entirely erroneous state
ment that the Hut is a branch oi! the Main 
Carnegie Library. The library in the Hut 
and the College of Pine Arts Library comprise, 
not a Carnegie branch* but the Carnegie Irlstitutc of Technology Library.
There in, of course, a close relationship between 
the two libraries which is of immense value to us. 
Large numbers of books are borrowed from the 
Main Library for the use of the Carnegie stu
dents. Every consideration possible is given to 
the Campus library and the students usually reap 
the benefits of these kindnesses through the me
dium of the Hut. The Hut is convenient 
and ordinarily is equipped with the preferred 
reference books. The Main Library is essentially 
a public library and naturally caters primarily to 
the public, but the Carnegie Tech Library is op
erated solely for the use of the students.
For a long time tin; four Technical Schools 
were without library facilities of their own ex
cept for the library in the College of Fine Arts. 
In .1920 the Y hut of the war days was com
mandeered to serve as a library temporarily. 
Each years the library has had its shelves in
creased, but the maximum efficiency is yet to be 
reached. While it is unnecessary for Carnegie to 
have a very large library, it is extremely desira
ble. that additions be made to the present small 
collections on art, architecture and history.
The engineering section, while well chosen, is 
necessarily limited by its smallness. A separate 
division for science and technology, planned 
along lines similar to the Arts School branch, 
might be placed in Science were that building al
ready overcrowded.
The needs of our students are peculiar and 
cannot best be met by a library, however com
plete, catering primarily to the general public. 
For this reason we should like to see our own 
facilities increased and suggest that a commission 
be appointed to investigate the possibilities for 
such expansion.
E. T.
THEATER CONFERENCE
We cannot legislate for point of yiew with any 
hope of success. We cannot plea'd for point of 
view with the least assurance of success. We can 
not by reliance on mans craving for culture 
and advancement, but rather on his egotistic de
sire to dominate and dazzle his fellowspains
takingly direct him to the entrance of the grande 
canon, whence he cannot deviate from the path 
of perfection.
Mankind is like a caterpillar. Slow, ponderous, * 
vibratory in its motion, it wanders aimlessly to
ward a chance destination unless some master 
hand guides it, blocks and turns it on a predeter
mined path. If the master hand grows lax for a 
moment, iI! the master eye sleeps but an instant, 
the creature disappearsto bo trampled under 
foot by some monster ; perhaps next to appear in 
flight, a thing of strange beauty, flashing in rain
bow flight for an instant, tasting tho honey of 
Gods flowers for an instant, then dashing toward 
tho sun, to bo consumed in the firo that is its life; 
or, summer waning, as tho swoots of nature 
wither, to wither also.
The master artists who gather here shortly to 
discuss American Drama have in their care tho 
larva, of this great winged creature. Their in
itial and prime problem is determination of tho 
right destination for thoir charge.
Tho eonforonco will doubtless lie another ol! 
those half-movements, those will-o-tho-wisp 
dashes toward tho improvement of human condi
tions that have marked all our uplift passions in 
the past. And why? Because tho masters will 
try to bring about I ho perfection of their art 
without any regard for the interrelationship of 
their art and the many other arts, crafts, profes
sions and vulgarities of our ultra-complex so
ciety.
The greatest of our classic civilizations perish
ed because of failure to curb tho over-develop
ment of pseudo-artistry. The revels that resulted 
in the dissipation of their antural energies were, 
1 believe, the expression of the laymans belief 
that artistic temperament was a part of his 
share in the division of the spoils of democracy. 
And has America ever given signs of moderation 
in the use of the tools of pleasure placed at her 
disposal ?
Anyone who has lived observantly within the 
field of the amateur dramatics movement lias felt 
the lirst breath of a new social divisionthe birth 
of an aristocracythe egoism of culturethe 
shifting of social skirts from the proximity of 
vulgar, proletarian associations. America is too 
susceptible to stratification. The modern creed 
of personal development had better serve as a 
stop, look and listen signal to the leaders. who 
perhaps are only adding another factor to the 
enormous equation of human relations that must 
be solved.
Why not a close co-ordination between art and 
reform ? I do not mean, of course, support of the 
prohibition laws, or of Henry Fords quadrille 
vision. Why doesn t art, probably the most pow
erful instrument for the control of mens minds 
that we possess, take definite steps to bring to its 
lay followers the freedom from prejudice and 
crude ethical beliefs that are its own greatest 
blessing.? Then, if man perishes, he will perish 
in a state of stupor, reaching for a, great, glowing 
dream-objective.
The artist will say that objectives interfere 
With his unleashed and natural flow of idoas. I 
deny that. Art is the work of inspiration. In
spiration, however, is not an oorio, groundless 
thing. It is the result of data at work in the 
under-mind. Only add to the volume of this data 
and you automatically broaden the possible field 
of art. Tho modern artist lives in a world in 
which materialism is the ideal. His duty is the 
study and interpretation of this new idealism. In 
a measure he has accomplished his duty; but he 
has done it with such looseness, such mad aban
don, that many great minds fear he has done 
more harm than good. Mere demonstrations oC 
license and licentiousness, pictured as the inevita
ble victory of primitive passions, are stirring the 
emotions of a world already overwrought.
We have no right to demand an accounting 
from the art-soul, people will say. The art soul 
is no greater a part of the human total than is 
any other man-soul. It must bear its share of 
the responsibility. The artist helps man forget 
for a moment the' cruel, cold world. What if 
.there are more or less serious after effects? 
That is the philosophy of the opium eater, and 
cannot be tolerated. We must strive to encomHOLIER-THAN-THOU
During my younger days, when readings in conserva
tism were establishing my prejudices, I had but one, 
ambition, namely, to lead a morally and economically 
righteous life. 11' only I might become familiar with 
orthodox standards of right and wrong, if only I were 
able to grow in accordance with the accepted and time
worn principles of moral etiquette than my future hap
piness would be assured. Again, I realized that I was 
born in economic sin, that by the very nature of homo 
sapiens 1 was relegated to the catagory of the ineffi
cient; I cried out in my dispalr for the potantates of 
modernism to pluck mo from out the burning bush, to 
help me to transcend this interont tendency toward 
doing things unsystematically and wastefully. The 
proposition was clear before my eyes. Man was born 
iirsin, morally, and born unto inefficiency, economical
ly, he VOK offensive both to God and to his felloworoatureB,
Two Pious Ejaculators offered succor. One, all 
wrapped up in a messianic complex, bearing the stench 
of Purltanifhi; tho other carrying tho ominous label 
of Efficiency Expert." The Puritan claimed my at
tention lirst, because my moral assurance seemed to bo 
so necessary. Our dear forofathors saw their Utopia 
in such an emotional wave of glory that, ere It hud sub
sided, all art had been consigned to llfty years of 
lethargy, a state of affairs which wo still fool tho effects 
of In Amorlcu. Thoro was always a certain fascina
tion associated with tho Puritan rosolutonoss In tho 
pursuit of thoir political liberty; the accounts of tho 
rise of tho republic abounds in glories of thoir early 
doings. But in tho realm of personal liberty, they 
wore always sticklers for little nicotlos and exactnesses 
of conduct. As specialists In the details of a well 
regulated Ufa, no one over surpassed tho Puritans; they 
wore nlways offensively worrying about the shortcom
ings of others, nlways dollnlug thoir notions of wlmt 
inado up right conduct, and finally endeavoring to InIIlet thoir Ideals on the general public. This typo of 
regulation, concerning Itself with tho accessories of 
behavior, rather than tho spirit of actions offorod no 
attractiveness to mo, In my pursuit .of righteousness.
Tho Efficiency Export interested me next. Hero 
I was, evidently an economic mlsllt, wasting my ener
gies, spending the greatest amount of time doing tilings 
inefficiently. Could I but let system come into my life, 
I would be living economically righteous. Tho Expert 
showed mo that 1 didnt have enough habits, and that 1 
expended too much conscious effort on trivial details. 
Within two weeks I had ceased to delight in the leasurely lighting of my pipe. I saved twenty seconds in 
this one instance, reducing the operation to live sec
onds, and shifting it over to the habit column. I ac
cumulated seventy-four minutes one day by forsaking 
my usual contemplative method in reading, and I fin
ished the two hundred pages in less than an hour. 
Again, I found that I was very unsystematic about 
rising in the morning and retiring at night. By adopt
ing a more methodical way of proceedure, I saved 
enough time to read up on methods of efficiency in all 
human activities. However, the anti-climax soon fol
lowed. In a month I had stopped smoking and read
ing, as they were rather parasites than necessities in 
my existence and they didn't seem to satisfy, as they 
had in the past. Furthermore, I was staying up too 
late at night and over-sleeping in the morning, de
pending too much on my newly evolved efficiency. 
********
My adventures in the realm of moral and economic 
righteousness are now over. I still recognize the Old 
Adam in my life, and I am not very much interested 
In efficiency. Perhaps I am content with my lot be
cause I have no desire to jump "from the. devil to the 
deep blue sea.

It is pleasing to note that a spirit of interna

ATHLETICS -e| WORLN NEWS]
The use of principles in the levying 
of taxes have as a rule been almost 
nil. It was Adum Smith that made 
the remark that the usual method 
was similar to the one the farmer fol
lows, when he plucks the live feathers 
from the geese, that is To get the 
greatest amount of feathers with the 
smallest amount of sciuacking." From 
the time of Adani Smith to the pres
ent, this lias been the system that has 
been generally followed and as a re
sult whenever the subject conies up 
there are a host of people eA5FS race to 
Washington in order to tell the Gov
ernment what, the rates slioUld be, 
usually based upon some benefit to 
themselves. At the present time the 
Ways and Means Committee of the 
House of Representatives under the 
guidance of the Chairman, William R, 
Green, is trying to get a Tax Reduc
tion Bill ready for the new Congress 
that, meets on December 7th. The 
task is a difficult one, since the de
mands of all the various parties and 
organizations thathave either an ac
tual or an assumed interest in it 
must be unified in compromise bill, re
gardless of the basic tax principles.
The provisions of the bill as it now 
stands, in its tentative state, are as 
follows:
1, The exemption for singlo men 
Increased from .$1,000 to $1,500 and for 
married men from $2,500 to $1,500.
2, The normal tax Is reduced from 
2 iier cent to 1%! por cont,
1 3. The surtax is reduced from 40 
per cont to 20 per cont, but no change 
occurs on incomes bolow $42,000.
4. Tho gift tax is ropoaled but any 
transfor of property without a mone
tary consideration of within two years 
before a mans death, will bo treated 
as a part of tho estate and taxable.
5. Tho amusement lax is-to bo kept.
(i. The publicity of amount of in
come taxes paid will bo withhold from 
the public unless the Attorney Gen
eral ilnds reason for the publicity.
7. A constitutional amendment re
lating to tho prohibition of tax ex
empt bonds.
8. The reduction of 25 per cent on 
earned incomes, which formerly had 
$5,000 as its limit, is increased to 
$20,000.
9. The estate tax rate of $50,000 
exemption will be kept and the same 
rates up to $150,000 but after that 
there will be a decrease in the pres
ent rate with 20 per cent as a maxi
mum.
10. The five per cent on automobiles 
is cut to 3 per cent and the 2 y2 per 
cent rate on auto supplies is abolished.
11. A lowering of the excise taxes 
on cigars and cigarettes.
12. The repeal o the 5 per cent tax 
on jewelry, the 10 per cent surtax on 
firearms, the 10 per cent tax on mah 
jong sets, the 10 per cent tax on pipes, 
the 5 per cent tax on films and the 
5 per cent tax on art work.
The fundamental rule in taxation 
which is generally accepted, is a tax 
according to the ability to pay. This 
rule which is, of course, followed to 
some extent is usually shoved aside 
when and where it. interferes with 
matters of politics, Thomas Adams, of 
Yale, a tax authority of note, suggests 
a Board of Tax Experts that would 
have the power to lay the tax rates in 
this country. They would have to bo 
an Impartial body and absolutely out 
of tho control of either party then in 
control so that there would ,not be the 
llkllhood of a out in the appropriation 
if the Board didnt, suit. Tho loadors 
of both parties havo acknowledged 
that It, Is a good system hut th 
chances of elthor party giving up its 
sovereignity is very slight.
As so often been reitoratcd in this 
column, the sooner wo can turn over 
to experts the tasks that are funda
mentally economic or that have to do 
with trade and the business of getting 
a living, just so much sooner will our 
government function as it ought to, 
among people with our heritage.
UNTOUCHED BOOKS
AWAIT IN PARRY ROOM
There is the thrill of adventure 
for the booklover in every new book 
that comes into his hands. It may 
contain old matter, yet the familiar 
word gain a new charm, from their 
freh printing. If the book is new 
indeed, then the thrill of newness, 
and the excitement of discovery may 
bo had by the mere turning of a 
page. To be the first person to open j 
a book, the first to cut the smooth 
page, the first to bend back the 
cover, the first to eye enticing lines 
of black printto be the very first 
person to lay hands on a book is to 
be a pioneer, an adventurer, a discov
erer of world unrealized.
Few of us are able to afford ad
venture of this kind as often as we 
should like. We eye new books 
through barriers of plate glass and 
sigh eneffectually after adventures 
beyond the reach of our pockets. And 
that is the reason it gives me such 
pleasure to announce that sixty-three 
adventures in literature lie upon the 
shelves of the Parry Room in the 
Hut awaiting the adventurersixtythree books fresh from the shop, 
beautiful, unspotted, covers unbent, 
pages unturned, inviting to the eye, 
alluring to the touch, satisfying to 
the soul, extending their invitation 
to anyone who has the curiosity to 
step into the room and imagination 
enough to know that he can find 
high adventure upon a library shelf.
There are some books, you remem
ber, that are to be chewed and digest
ed. These are in the Hut proper. 
One can see students every hour of 
the day sitting at the long tables, 
chewing off large bites, sunk some
times in a torpor of digestion. These 
books have no place in the Parry 
Room. One is dealing in that charmed 
spot with books that are to be tasted 
and swallowed. Though some of 
them cry out to be swallowed at one 
sitting, circumstances fortunately 
prevent indiscretion. The books may 
not be taken out of the room; they 
can be read only during the intervals 
of delicious leisure that punctuate 
even the busiest days. It is a brows
ing room, not a dining room; but lie 
who has browsed once will certainly 
return to browse again.
The old proverb says that you can 
lead a horse to water but that you 
cannot make him drink. Miss Parry's 
great virtue as a teacher was that 
she made him want to drink. Litera
ture was never devitalized in her 
classroom; it was found there to be 
full of life and worth seeking for its 
own sake. Hence our memorial to 
hera room from which perfunctory 
stury is banished and in which books 
may be spontaneously enjoyed.
It is difficult for those of us who 
knew Miss Parry and to whom she 
is still a. living presence to realize 
that since the class of 1924 left us 
there have been in the school no stu
dents to whom she is more than'a 
name. For there has never been any
one at Carnegie whose interest in 
the students was keener or whose in
fluence upon them has been more en
during. As a teacher of English in 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie College 
from 1911 to 1920, she came Into con
tact with hundreds of girls. The 
strength of their affection for her is 
indicated by the fund, raised largely 
through their efforts, which has 
purchased the new books on tho 
shalvcs of the memorial room.
The thought of her was like a flash 
of light,
Or an unseen 'companionship.
So says the little bookplate inside 
the covers of her books. Though the 
students who now turn the pages of

those books cannot know Miss Parry, 
they must feel her companionship 
when they seek literary adventure in 
her room. As they sail the high 
seas with Conrad, or listen to the
gossip of Samuel. Pepys, or dip into 
anthologies of modern verse, they will, 
though unconsciously, become one in 
spirit with the booklover to whom 
the Parry Room is dedicated.
