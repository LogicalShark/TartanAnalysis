RECITALS GIVEN BY THE
DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC
After mucii burning of tlie wires be
tween here and New York, Dr. T. S. 
Baker announces that Will Hays will 
surely be here on Friday, May 26 to 
speak to the students. A rousing re
ception is due Mr. Hays, in view of 
his tremendous-responsibilities as di
rector of the movie industry, his com
ing to Tech, with no other object than 
to help us out, is an event that should 
make Campus Week one of the bigger 
things in college annals. To Dr. 
Baker, also, goes the credit for se
curing the services of Mr. Hays, and 
we owe him thanks for his assistance 
and co-operation.
Will Hays is one of this countrys 
big men, not in size, but in business 
and politics. As chairman of the Re
publican . National Committee he 
showed himself to be a briliant organ
izer. As Postmaster General last year 
he won the respect and confidence of 
the whole country by his efficient con
duct of the office. His public decis
ions in his present capacity as the 
movie chief have, so-far, been heartily 
approved. It is confidently predicted 
that the entire industry will be ele
vated to a much higher plane under 
his administration.
The students will hear him at about 
10:30 Friday 'morning. The place is 
the foyer of the Arts Building. In 
addition to his address, Mr. Hays will 
assist in several other features of the

The Shilling, co-operating with the 
Psychology Department, included

Gripping Shilling Criticisms
A Feature of Campus Courier
When the Campus Courier, known 
from coast to coast as the yellowest 
journal in America, makes its initial 
appearance this Thursday, lovers of 
good literature will find excellent 
reading in its historic pages. Not 
only will this "Autocrat of the Break
fast Table spread forth the news of 
the day in glowing type, but In addi
tion will run each day a just and mic
roscopic criticsm of the days "Shill
ing. To one who is familiar with 
the idiosyncracies of the Shilling, the 
joy of anticipation will leap all 
bounds. Imagine the feeling of hapUriness and satisfaction that will 
spread over you when, upon picking 
up the morning Courier, you find an 
eloquent criticism of your girls latest 
oem To a Welsh Rabbit. What 
Could cause you more pleasure let us 
ask, than the perusal of an absorbing
i
article on the Evils of Gambing, or 
How Our Society Girls of M. M. C. 
Make an Honest Living?"
In addition to this notorious feat
ure, the Courier will also contain in 
Thursdays edition, a section which 
alone renders it worth the price of 
admission, to-wit, a ballot for the 
Queen of the Mardi Gras. This has 
been officially sanctioned and when 
properly clipped will count as an offi
cial vote. Campaign managers of the 
fair candidates are hereby warned in 
advance that the Courier staff has 
sworn to unflinching honesty, and no 
bribes of cash or liquid ^ffers will be 
considered. The Courier has appoint
ed itself as an official organ of the 
common people and as such feels it 
is its duty to print all evidence of 
campaign corruption which tends to

history of American colleges.
Dean Scales exhibited remarkable 
Initiative and a koon understanding 
of human nature, In planning a pro
gram, which aimed to create a closor 
and moro personal understanding of 
the girl students at Carnegie Tech.
Scales' interest has not been 
confined to the official duties of her 
office, but her Influence has been felt 
throughout all of the organizations
sonai interest that Miss Scales has 
taken in her work has made her tho 
everlasting friend of all who havo 
had the opportunity of knowing her.
Doan Scales Is leaving Carneglo 
Toch about the first of July. Aftor 
a vacation In England this summor, 
she will return to her Alma Mator, ,1

Sho has been active In studying ed- , 
ucatlonal problems,-and has contrib- / 
uted much to the advancement of LI10

The loss of Dean Scales to Carnegie 
Tech will be keenly felt by all the 
students, and it will be difficult tc 
secure a successor who can take hei 
place in the hearts of the students.

CAMPUS WEEK HERE
With the inter-fraternity dances tonight Campus Week begins. 
Three years ago Campus Week was a trial and then a success. Last 
year left no doubt that Campus Week was a part ol; Carnegie Tech. 
.In the two years that have gone by, we have had our experiences 
certain features of Campus Weeks have been eliminated, others have 
 been augmented. With this experience, a stall of capable men di
recting, ancl the undergraduates eager to assist activities, this year's 
Campus Week should be an unquestioned success in every detail.
For the alumni, Campus Week was primarily instituted. We 
hope that they will be back in greater numbers than before. Upon

The curtain will fall on Campus 
Week with the presentation of the 
latest spasm from Design School, 
''Rennys Place." It will occur at the 
'Schenley Theater at 8:15, Saturday 
night, and will be a fitting close for a 
glorious week. The cast will be an 
all star one and will include Ross 
Hertz, Jack Williard, Carl Reid, 
George Hoag, Peg Harmon, Ruth Kauf
man and others.
The athletic program for the week 
will be an extensive one, calculated to 
satisfy the followers of all the spring 
sports.
The baseball game with Penn 
State at Forbes Field will be one of 
the high spots of the week, and the 
game with Bethany will occasion but 
little less interest. Bucknell will be 
beaten at tennis and fans will see a 
real match when the Alumni will at
tempt to take over the Varsity. This 
will be an interesting contest, for 
all the Alumni are well-known and 
will receive as much support as the 
Varsity. The track meet with West 
Virginia will conclude the program, 
and it is hoped that the Plaid will 
make a clean sweep of the five con
tests.

for celegrating Campus Week is the.

At State College, 9-2
3ezdeks Proteges Benefit 
By Plaid Errors
After having two games on tlie 
baseball trip postponed, the Plaid 
)all players ran into a snag when 
:hey met the proteges of Bezdek at 
ytate College last Saturday afternoon. 
Phe Penn Staters came off the dia
mond with the long end of a 9-2 score. 
JVWarrick, who occupied the hill for J4 ^Tartans pitched a good game, and 
|ate should have fared much better 
ritli him but for the glaring miscues 
jf his teammates. Four costly errors 
were made by the Plaid infielders, 
each one of which counted for scores, 
even though hits were inter-mixed. 
Dzwiteski, pitching for the Center 
countians hurled from the port side, 
and this coupled with a very effective 
bit of wildness, kept the Tartan base 
liits well scattered. Behind him his 
teammates played fast and almost 
errorless ball. Two fast double plays 
featured, and in each case, stopped 
would-be run getting tactics by Car
negie Tech.
Enos Kirkpatrick was forced to 
shift his men around a bit because of 
an injury to A1 Irwin. Red Godden performed behind the bat, and 
in this respect the backstopping part 
of the lineup was just about as strong 
as usual. The only difference caused 
was the fact that Kirkpatrick was 
forced to use Joe Mills, a left-hand 
hitter against a port-side twirler, 
whereas he would have under ordin
ary circumstances used McCaw, Godden and Robertson in the outfield, all 
three being right-handed batters. 
Dzwilski had the lefthanders at his 
mercy throughout the game, with the
RIFLE TEAM COMPLETES 
SUCCESSFUL SEASON
The Carnegie Tech Rifle Team 
has just recently completed its sea
son, and for the interest of those who 
were connected with the team and 
others who wish to know more about 
its work, it is well that we review 
what has been accomplished o far, 
and to predict what it may do in the 
future.
The Rifle Club, from which the 
team material is picked, was 
organized November, 1920. At 
first practice was held at 
at the Eighteenth Regiment Armory, 
but later permission was given by 
the school to use the space under the 
roof of Design School. This space is 
adequate to meet the needs of the 
team for some time, but it is hoped 
that space will be provided for a 
first-class range in the new gym.
The first match this year was with 
Harvard early in the season. Other 
teams taken over by Carnegie Tech. 
this year include Cornell. Colgate, j 
Columbia, and within seven points 
from winning from Yale, which is 
considered one of the best rifle teams 
in the country.
Next year the team will start 
training early, and if enough good 
material can be selected from the 
Freshman Class at the start, we will 
have a freshman team. This would 
make it easier to choose good marks
men for a regular team in succeeding 
years.

CAMPUS WEEK IS HERE!
So is Wally Steffen! Nut Sed!
A chance to see Wally, to shake hands with him, and chat with him 
is surely a chance we all want. And, not at all strange, "Wally likes to 
do the same to all of us! So, when you *see him, GREET HIM, make him 
happy that he is .back among us. He is without a doubt the greatest foot
ball coach of them all. We of Carnegie Tech are indeed fortunate that he 
wishes to, and IS to be with us in the future. Many schools want him 
these schools will pay'him more than we can. but Wallv cares not for 
thatwhat he DOES care for is Carnegie Techhe sticks with us because 
he loves Carnegie Tech and her football players, and when such conies into 
the question, money doesnt count at all. So fellows, make "Wally wel
come; make him feel at home; mak^ him happy that he is here!
AND WHILE ON THE SUBJECT 
of Campus Week, just a little reminder would not be amiss. Back yonder 
in the Fall, when football was being played, we were accustomed to seeing 
a truly wonderful spirit, known all around as The Carnegie Tech Spirit. 
Since the last football game it has been missingnow is the time to revive 
it, so lets do it! We have had at the baseball games so far crowds that 
could not put to shame even a one-horse hick tenvn. Cheer-leaders have not 
been present. Cheering has been spasmodic and has become like that seen 
at a professional gamegood, if the team is winning, bad, it' losing. It is 
a college tradition to cheer at all times, and organized. Wally expects 
thislets not disappoint him!
THE GAME AND CONTESTS 
of the week are to be good enough to demand the best support we can give. 
Penn State baseball game, Bucknell tennis match, Alumni tennis, Bethany 
ball game, West Virginia track meet! Can you beat that list for a splendid 
array of athletic contests?
Let us, everyone of us, be out to see every one of these contests!

pent-up energies in playing pranks, and acting in general like the Ivatzenjammers. All in all twas a great trip, so the report goes.
Rube Hedlund was sleeping soundly when the train arrived at the

SPRING TENNIS TOURNAMENTS
The annual girls tennis tournament started on Monday of this week. 
Last year it was very successful, with about twenty girls playing through. 
Miss Dora Henderson, Arts, won out., Tills year the Arts claim they will 
win again, but there re a lot of good players in the "MMD who will dis
pute this claim. At any rate the outlook is very bright for a fine and spir
ited tourney.
Right along the same line is the mens tournament,' open to all men 
not on the varsity squad. Entries must be in today. Drawings will be made 
tonight, and posted tomorrow. The first and second rounds must bo played 
off by Monday of next week. Find your man, and got him to play. Do 
your part to make this tournament just as successful as the annual fall 
tournaments. If successful, the spring tournament will be made an annual 
affair. Whether it will or not depends upon you. So, do your part.
The Alumni tennis team is practicing often now-a-days for their tour
nament with the Varsity this Saturday. They had two dark horses out last 
Sunday, and they look pretty good too. Am glad the Alumni sees the need 
for strengthening up a hit!

A non-technical discussion of the

leaky gas mains by welding. Faculty 
and alumni notes conclude this is

This afternoon the tennis team goes 
to Washington to play Washington & 
Jefferson the second match of the 
season between, the two schools.
Although W. & J. lost to the Plaid 
racqueteers 5-1 on the Tartan Courts, 
they claim that this time the score 
will be reversed. Carnegies defeat 
by Michigan, most honorable though 
it was, together with W. &. J.s impres
sive 6-0 win over Thiel, the only match 
they have won so far this season, 
seems to have instilled much confi
dence Into the Presidents.
Tomorrow, at Forbes Field, the Car
negie nine gets its supreme test. 
Penn State will bo met. Although 
starting off very poorly In the early 
part of the season, the Lions have de
veloped tremendous strength, and now 
are one of the top notch teams of the 
Tri-State League. Notwithstanding 
the factthat last Saturday, the Plaid 
lost to Penn State 9-2, that dope caunot be relied upon when it. comes to 
betting good gold. The Tartans 
have a splendid team, and tills time 
ought to be able to turn the tables. 
A great crowd of Nittany rooters will 
be there to give strong competition to 
the Tartan cheering. It will be, be
yond all doubt the biggest sport event 
since football season.
Friday, there are two events to fill 
up the day. The strong Bucknell Ten
nis team, which beat Penn State *1-2 
the other day, will be met at 10:30 on 
the Carnegie Courts. The Plaid ex
pect the hardest kind of opposition, 
but are determined to win this Im
portant match. In the afternoon tlio 
Bethany and the Tartan nine play on 
the Cut diamond. Bethany-Carnogie clashes always arouso intense in
terest, for Bethany lias the right kind 
of fighting spirit, and are a hard team 
to beat. If the Plaid Is to remain 
among the Trl-Stato leadors they must 
whip Bethany.
Saturday, tlio Alumni-Varslty match 
is to begin at 10:30 on the local 
courts. The alumni have a powerful 
combination In Smortz, Beaty, Stockslager, Harlcness, Marshall and Davis, 
and on paper they ought to win. Tlio 
varsity, fortunately, have the advant
age of more practleo.
A big dual moot with West Virginia 
is the interesting event at the Schenley Oval, Saturday aftornoon. Wost, 
Virginia has a splendid track team 
and are oBpeclally strong In the fiold 
ovents. In running, the Tartan cin
der men ar concedod to bo the su
perior. The outcome of this moot can
not he certain until the last ovent Is 
over. It will bo a nip and tuck af
fair all tlio way through.
In the 'meantime tho baseball toam 
travels to Grove City. Grove City is 
aching to got ovon for that terrible 
beating which Carnoglo handed thom 
lioro. Tuosday the toam goos to 
Bethany, another stiff game. If suc
cessful in tho game tills woolc tlio 
Plaid have an oxcollont chance to

MICHIGAN VICTOR OVER 
SK1B0 RACQUETERS, 5-1
In probably one of the fastest and 
most spectacular matches over play
ed on the Tech courts Captain Duke 
Neville captured tho match with his 
man, Reindol. The first set was givo 
and take until Duke found his 
opponent's weak points, but even 
then there was no lack of action for 
Reidel. a member of the 1920 Michi
gan team played tho same sort of 
smashing game.
Another exciting match which look
ed very encouraging to tho Sklbo 
spectators was the one between Con
nie Schwartz of Tech and Merkel 
of Michigan. Merkel took over tho 
first set by the closest possible num
ber of games, then "Connie came 
back strong by taking the next set 
and tho first two tallies of tho third 
set. Those two men fought hard for 
every point and although the rubber 
set was won by Merkel much de
served praise is due to "Connie" for 
putting up a stubborn defense.
The other two single matches start
ed out well but both Kell and Copley 
resorted to the defensive after the 
third game. Their respective oppo
nents, Rorrick and Sanchez, took ad
vantage of this opportunity and 
placed tho ball so well that even Tilden with his quick action could not 
have returned it. '
Keiland Schwartz coupled in the 
doubles against Merkel and Roindel. 
Having lost the first set the two Tar
tans began the second by taking throe 
games in a row, but they soomod to 
lose out because each did not cover 
his own part of the court.
Tho second match of the doubles 
was anything hut a walk away. Nev
ille and Copley paired off against 
Sanchez and Rorrick and this was a 
battle for points. Neville handled tho 
back-hand well and pounded the hall 
like tho best of tho players of tho 
game, while Coploy occasionally 
brought on applause from the on
lookers by returning balls that looked 
impossible to reach. Tlio two Michi
gan partners knew each others play
ing well enough tlvit they managed 
to keep their court covorod most of 
tho tlmo. Copley had a weak second 
servo and this proved to bo one of 
tho detriments that helped tho Michi
gan moil to win tho two cloao aota.

Nikola Tesla
T
HE NAME of Nikola Tesla will always 
bo associated with the invention and earlier 
developments of the induction motor. In fact, 
at one time this type of apparatus was known 
almost exclusively as the Tesla motor.
Tesla devised this motor back near the be
ginnings of the electrical business, when pracJ  
tically everything was built by cut and try 
methods, and none of the accurate analytical proc
esses of later days had been developed. It may be 
said broadly that Tesla knew two fundamental 
factsfirst, that if a magnet were moved across 
a sheet of conducting metal, it would tend to 
drag this metal along; and,second, that the 
cffects of such a moving magnet could be pro
duced by suitably disposed polyphase currents 
acting on a stationary magnetic structure.
Perhaps others, at that, time, also knew these 
two facts, but if so, apparently they knew them 
only as two isolated facts. Tesla considered 
them in combination and the result was the 
Tesla motor, or what is now known broadly as 
the induction motor. These two facts, in 
combination, represent a fundamental concep
tion, and all of the many millions of horsepower 
of induction motors in use today throughout the 
world, arc based upon those two fundamentals.
Naturally, Westinghouse, having fought single 
luiuded lo advance the alternating current system, 
was supremely interested in the new type of 
motor. What if the new motor did require
polyphase circuits-, whiL all existing; circuits 
were single phase? What if it did require 
lower frequency than any existing commercial 
circuits? These were merely details of the future 
universal alternating system. The important 
thing was to obtain an ideally simple type of 
alternating current motor, which Teslas inventionoffered. Tesla furnished the fundamental idea.
lie and his associates, working for Mr. West
inghouse, proved that thoroughly operative 
induction motors could be built, provided suitable 
frequencies and phases were available. What 
matter if they did not produce an operative 
commercial system at the time? What matter if 
it needed the powerful analytical engineers of 
later date to bring the system to a truly prac
ticable stagemen with intimate constructive 
knowledge of magnetic circuitsmen on intimate 
terms with reactive coefficients and other magnetic 
att ributes totally unknown to Tesla and his co
workers? I11 time the motor was made com
mercial, and it lias been a tremendous factor in 
revolutionizing the electrical industry.
Probably no one electrical device has had more 
high-power analytical and mathematical ability 
expended upon it than the induction motor. 
The practical result has been one of the simplest 
and most effective types of power machinery in 
use today. Thus Teslas fundamental ideas and 
West.inghouses foresight have led to an enormous 
advance in the worlds development.
