TARTAN GRIDDERS OVERWHELM CARNEGIE AND PITT MEN AT Y CONFERENCE ON TO CLEVELAND! ONLY TWO 
HOLLERANS YELLOW JACKETS
BY 28-0 IN ANNUAL STRUGGLE
Skibo Machine Trounces Thiel Squad 
By Heavy Attack of Line Plunges  
Thiel Players Advance to Plaid 
Two-Yard Line
SECOND TEAM USED IN GAME
By G. E. JACOBY
It was typical fall weather which saw Carnegie Tech celebrate 
her second gridiron victory of the season when Thiel College was 
overwhelmed to the tune of 28-0. The sudden drop of the mercury 
caused the scanty crowd to shiver in the stands in spite of a rather 
brazen sun which gave little in the way of warmth. Top coats, over
coats, and even mufflers and furs were well distributed throughout 
the enthusiastic crowd of rooters.
Shortly) after the sending of the 
Plebe game Hollerans squad o yel
low jackets swept down onto the field 
closely followed by Steffen and his 
red-clad Tartan machine. Previous 
reports had leaked out from the 
Greenville school that the Blue and 
Gold were coming to the Tartan bowl 
to win and that Coach Holleran had 
a fast eleven that could not be 
checked by the Skibo defense. The 
Plaid coaches working on this theory 
all week had developed a team that 
was ready to meet this onslaught and 
prove the reports untrue. Followers 
of the Skibos were a little uncertain 
as to the outcome of the fray and 
thronged the field earlj' to wait for 
the kickoff.
The Greenville lads were primed for 
victory and played a snappy brand o 
football but due to the superior weight 
of the Plaid were unable to break 
through the line for any appreciable 
distance. .Small but courageous, out
weighed but never lacking fighting 
spirit. Time after time they plowed 
into the line only to be blocked by 
the stonewall defense of Steffens pro
teges. The Tartan machine on the 
other side kept up its continual grind 
of varied attacks, line plunging, and 
end runs, carrying the ball almost at 
will.
During the initial period of the game 
Robertson and Brumbaugh carried the 
ball around the ends and through the 
line until it was placed on the 23- 
yard line where Robertson went 
through the lino for a touchdown.
The second period of the game saw 
several penalties and some spectacu
lar tackling. Mefort, right end, 
plunged through left tackle for a first 
down and shortly after he again tore 
around tho end and across the chalk 
line for a touchdown. Comfort, the

WILL TAKE SENIOR 
PICTURES MONDAY
Union Will be Open at 9:00 
a. m. for Thistle Pictures 
Come Early, Avoid Rush
The Senior pictures for the This
tle will be taken in the Carnegie 
Union beginning Monday, October 15, 
at 9 oclock under the direct supervi
sion of Mr. McKay who has the con
tract for this years Thistle pictures.
The first picture will cost $1.00 and 
every additional print will cost 30 
cents. While this is higher than last 
years cost, it is not at all excessive 
when everything is considered. The 
man who has only one picture will no
tice it most, but those who have three 
or four cuts in the book will be get
ting off cheaper than last year. It is 
too much to ask the photographer to 
make the first cut for 50 cents and 
last year the photographer lost a con
siderable sum on his contract for this 
reason.
After the Senior pictures are taken, 
the fraternity pictures will be taken. 
The board hopes to get this part of 
the work over as soon as possible, and 
asks the co-operation of the Seniors 
in getting the pictures taken. D. 
Garber has been appointed Senior 
Editor, while E. Miller is fraternity 
editor.

Did you ever have a thought dawn 
upon you of becoming famous at col
lege? Especially you Plebes, who 
were, perhaps, the big cheese in your 
little home town? Well, right here is 
a chance to make a name for your
self on the campus of Carnegie Tech. 
That is, if you have any grit or punch 
or snap about yourself. Well, we sup
pose you must be interested, or you 
wouldnt have read this far. So heres 
the dope.
Every , college of any prominence or 
popularity, puts, out a monthly maga
zine, containing all the wit and pep 
of that institution. Now, in case you 
have never had the opportunity of 
hearing the name of the magazine 
Carnegie Tech produces, well have to 
tell you about it before we go any 
farther. It is the world-famous Pup
pet. And that is no exaggeration, 
either. The Puppet is known all over 
the country, so dont say you never 
heard of it before, or your associates 
will think youre a hicko, just arriv
ing from the Sahara desert or the 
pyramids of King Tut.

COUNCIL OPPOSED TO 
PAINTING OF NUMERALS
The first regular meeting of the 
Tecknon Club will be held on Thurs
day evening, October 11, at 6:00 p. 
m., sharp, at the Shadyside Presby
terian Church. An attractive program 
has been arranged, followed by a 
business meeting. Dr. Kerr will say 
a word about the course he expects 
to follow this year, with a short 
greeting to all. It is hoped that all 
the old members will attend, and 
bring with them plenty of pep with 
which to start the new year.
Those desiring to be there please 
get in touch or sign up on the bul
letin boards in M. M. or on the cut 
before Tuesday night. - i
Hereafter all students involved in 
painting class numerals on walks and 
elsewhere on the campus will be hold 
directly responsible to the Student 
Council. At its meeting last week the 
Council passed a rule forbidding such 
painting. USET paint used is of such a 
permanent nature that the walks and 
buildings are permanently defaced, 
thus destroying the good appearance 
of the campus. It was further decid
ed that all violators of this rule are 
to be brought before the Council for 
trial and punishment.
The Plebe Regulations Committee 
proposed two additional Freshman 
rules which were acted on favorably. 
First, that all Plebes shall doff their 
caps when passing the Senior Fence. 
Second, that the Sophomores shall not 
keep Plebes from their classes at any 
time. Col. Day has received many 
complaints of this being done.

It will be in the nature of a rally for

A new department at Carnegie Toch 
offers wonderful opportunities to tho 
students, as well as tho public at

Dr. Connelley, who was one of tho 
three members of tho advisory com
mittee appointed by Mr. Carneglo at 
the time of the founding of tho Insti
tution, is now the director of tho de
partment* of Industrial Relations. For 
fifteen years ho was Doan of tho Colloge of Industries, and his wide expe
rience in tho industrial world makos 
him a vory capable man for tho posi
tion which ho now holds.
Dr. Connelley has aldod in forming 
advisory boards with nineteon of- tho 
leading manufacturing concorns In 
this city and vicinity. Tho,chief ob
ject of the department is to co-oporato 
with the various manufacturers in or
der to give the student tho kind of 
work that industry demands. There 
is a different demand inevery Held 
of industry, and tho student should 
have a knowlodgo of the basic prin
ciples in the field which he expects to 
enter. The department is to investi
gate the general requirments and em
phasize these points in tho courses 
offered.
There are many manufacturers in

Beauty Comments to Teach Co-eds 
Who Simply Will Not Use Their Heads
BASTIAN GETS LOOSE FOR 20 YARDS
Have you looked into a mirror since . 
last week? Did you see any change? | 
Girls, it is quite tragic if there has j 
been no change, especially after read- j 
Ing the weekly Beauty Hints in The ! 
Tartan.
As a sort of recapitulation, think j 
back oyer the past few' weeks, and j 
see what has been said about being j 
beautiful. First, a word or two on j 
the general subject of beauty, and J 
why it should be more abundant on j 
the campus. We have a beautiful! 
campus, and with the efforts of Colonel 
Fairley in evidence all around, we 
can expect a more beautiful one. Now. 
girls, is it fair to Carnegie Tech to 
have a homely bunch of Co-eds run
ning all over a beautiful spot like 
this? No! Each and every girl
should feel a bit conscience stricken, 
and should see whether she is doing 
her share to make things look better.
As a second thought, the mater of 
figures was brought to the minds of 
the literal Co-eds. Not many changes 
have been seen in this respect, but 
Paul, the Gardner is doing his bit to 
keep thlngB in better shape here. How 
about it, girls, are you doing your bit? 
Twice a day, before a mirrornot a 
windowwill soon put you into shape.
Naturally, when you have to have 
your pictures taken for the Thistle, 
you will want to look as well as pos
sible. There is no time like the pres
ent to start looking well. Get out the 
old Kodak (advertisement) and prac
tice looking the birdie in the eye,

so any girls In M. M. or Arts, who 
aro contemplating Joining tho club; 
should make a special effort to be 
present on Wednesday, October 10,

essary because of the fact that six of

As soon as the range has been

contests of this tournament will bo 
given gold and silver medals.

VOTINGYOUR DUTY!
I t is 1)11(! prroBtive ol! every citizen in tho United States to vote. 
More, it is the duty oJ! every citizen to go to the polls on every voting1 
day and cast Iris ballot.Back in the revolutionary days ol! 1770 when our forefathers 
shed their blood for the foundation ol! your right to have a part in 
deciding tvho shall rule as the duly-elected head of your government, 
there was a .just and sincere cause for an uprising, backed by a desire, 
to rule iltemselvtfft.
And today, there is ;just as just a cause for the peoples of our 
United States to go to the polls and decide who shall be the ruling 
heads of our land. In the past, during the revolutionary period, the 
just cause was one of injustice being dealt out by an appointed offi
cial. Today, the just cause is that of the ever-present -tendency upon 
a part of the voting public to neglect their duty, and stay away from 
the polls, with the result ol! interest control of everything, oftimcs 
much to the detriment of that which our forefathers fought in 70.
This little thought upon the subject of voting has a reason and 
a purpose. A little laxity on the part of Certain student-citizens of 
Carnegie Tech is the reason. Its purpose is to spur these self-same 
students to pay more attention to their voting duties in the future.
Here at (aruegie we have our own little United States'

PLEBE-SOPH MEMORIALS
 Visitors coming to our campus notice the defects before they see 
the beauties, - and among those defects are the large numerals that 
various,olaNHos have adorned the campus with in various spots.
Concerning this au alumnus has the following to say: While 
on a motoring trip this summer I hod occasion to stop at Mcadvillc, 
.Pa,, and I visited the campus ol! Allegheny College. At ono point I 
noticed a large boulder on the lawn on which was carved the I'ollow
ing inscripl ion :
'Sophomores ol 1880'
I paused to .relleet how much bettor was the appearance of Ninth a 
memorial as compared with smears ol! rod and green paint depicting 
the valor of various elasses which I have seen on the campus of Caruegie Tech.
"It seems to me that a dignified memorial ol this sort is some
thing that the undergraduate (tan remember with honor after he is 
through school; whereas, a few daubs ol paint defacing the appear
ance ol our buildings is something that wo do not care to remember.
Whether any memorial, such as the large boulder mentioned by 
this alumnus is used or not some thought should be given the use of 
paint on the cai'npus by the Plebe classes, for it secnls to be almost a 
tradition that sometime within the life of the iirst-yoar class they 
must display their numerals on points of vantage about tho campus.
We do not believe that it is the fault entirely or the act of the 
incoming men. They are merely following the path made' by many 
former members of the Carnegie Clan. Freshmen would not ordin
arily think of painting and defacing parts of the campus if these 
acts were not suggested by similar acts of years before and even 
suggestions from upperclassmen.
Wlmt we must do is, to declare ourselves opposed to such class 
activities and take pride in our campus.

detachment of 25 picked men marched onto the football field, armed to 
the neck,, ready to serve the man
ager. Each and every) guard was 
armed with a cartridge belt. These 
guards were posted at vantage points 
on the field, where they could see the 
gome well, and at the- same time 
prevent others from seeing it. With 
a j/mud and haughty air, self consci
ous of their newly acquired posi
tions the men walked to and fro, 
during the entire game. When the 
final whistle blew, the guards were 
called, counted and dismissed.
Seriously, this step lias been taken 
to prevent certain undesii^ible ele-, 
ments from over-running the field 
and proximity. Uninvited guests 
were prohibited from entering the 
reserved seats grandstand, and also 
from crowding the side lines. The 
step .also did away with the super
fluity; of policemen, whose duty it 
was to congregate in one corner of 
the field and talk over the Pitt game 
of the previous week. The R. O. T. 
C. men have all been picked from a 
number of volunteers, and will work 
throughout the season both at Tech 
Field, and at Forbes Field. Their 
work is not always pleasant, for it is 
never nice to make someone else un
comfortable, but they work for the 
good of Carnegie Tech. They stand 
for a lot of razzing" and go about 
their duty cheerfully. There are just 
a few things which the students 
might do to help the guards in their 
work.
In the drst half, dont try to cross 
from the bleachers to the reserved 
seat section.
Try to' use the exit nearest you? 
seat, rather than trying to crowd out 
of the main gate.
Try' to keep from dropping valua
bles and gloves under the grand
stand, for it leads to many embarras
sing situations when small boys are 
sent under the stands to retrieve 
lost articles. Many complaints have 
come into the Graduate Managers 
Office concerning those miscreants. 
Do -your bit to help in this way.
As Carnegie students set the ex
ample in oneying the Guards, for they 
only act as they are ordered, and this 
will help the outsiders to understand 
what the Guards are supposed to be 
doing. Dont encoura ge in fractions 
of the rules by kidding the Guards 
give them your help, for they need 
it ,badly.
Remember, the Guards are merely 
I students and have no innate power 
of authority. They represent the 
management, and have 110 means 
whereby they can enforce their rules, 
other than tlio requests they make 
of the students. Carry out their re
quests and help to keep things in 
good order on tho field.
It is always refreshing to find an; 
organization which believes it has I 
something worth while to offer man-j 
stake its exist-kind, and which w: 
ence upon that belief Not often is 
such an organization found and it ia 
therefore worthy of note when if. does 
exist. .
The Young Mens Christian Asso
ciation leaves doubt in no man's 
mind as to its position 011 several 
issues of the day. That such is the 
case is well known to us all, but it 
is of particular interest now because! 
of the campaign for members which! 
the Carnegie Branch is conducting.
When, about two yeai-3 ago the Y 
first appeared on the campus, there; 
were many predictions, most of them 
sceptical, as to its probable success. 
Most agreed that there was a defin
ite need for the Y, but it seemed so 
hopeless to expect great things to 
come from that little office in the 
Central Building. I11 spite of the 
limitations of its locations the Y 
has dauntlessly been working away 
for THE COOD OF CARNEGIE1 
TECH, and is now one of the most 
powerful forces on the campus lag-[ 
ging, as Don Gardner might say.1 
only a little behind -the Math De-I 
partment.
The first year tlla.t the red triangle; 
was on the campus it included among! 
its members 25 per cent of the men j 
students; last year 40 per cent be-! 
longed. The tangible results of thc| 
two years activities are listed in an
other column, but the intangible re
sults are after all much more in
teresting. How many of us have 
not had a cheery smile as we wan
dered past the door of the office? 
Remember last year, during, the 
Notre Dame game, when the snow 
was on the ground, who provided 
blankets for the bare knees or uie 
drum major and his conorts? Why, 
the Y, of course! Who looked 
after the food at Penn State? Who 
arranged the Dorm Smoker? Who 
visits the sick? Who is always 
ready with (a helping word, when 
given half a chance? Right, you 
guessed it, the Y"!
This, column ia not in general de
voted to advertise any organization. 
It IS FOR THE GOOD OF CARNE
GIE TECH, first, last and all the 
time, and it is with this view only 
that you are now asked to give your 
support. Any organization, 110 mat
ter what its name, that does the 
work that the Y does here de
serves support. The Y helps us. 
Will you help it? Choose your own 
path, but keep in mind the good of 
Carnegie Tech.

Dr. Keppel is a widely known man

Radio Course Continued 
in Night School Classes
Because of the great success of 
the radio course given . at summer 
school, the Electrical Equipment has 
decided to continue this course 
through the winter months. This 
subject will be given in night school 
over a perior of twenty-eight weeks. 
There will be six hours a week 
which includes one hour of code 
practive, two hours of lecture, and 
three hours of laboratory work. This 
radio course would be of a decided 
advantage for hardware dealers and 
salesmen, school teachers, and ama
teurs. Since the number of men to 
be enrolled will be limited those 
wishing to take this subject should 
make immediate application.

in his talk. The Y. W. C. A. girls 
acted as waitresses, and the service 
surpassed1 that at the Ritz.
It is planned to place a. large ther
mometer in the Commons, which will 
record the progress of the drive, dur
ing the three days. Last year this 
plan was followed, and the thermom
eter was broken in the act of record
ing the . drive subscriptions. This 
year a larger thermometer lias been 
procured, but it is hoped, by the com
mittee that it may be broken as the 
one last year wasiu doing its best 
to keep up with the drive.
In case any student cannot be 
served with a blank for enrollment 
at the time of tho Assembly, the 
committeemen will be posted aroujid 
tho Campus, so there is no excuse for 
anyone going without subscribing to 
the drive.
Last year tho Carnegie Tech Y 
was represented by ten delegates at 
the Silver Bay Conference, and with 
the new plans for the drive, it. is ex
pected that more men will be sent 
next year. Secretary Davis wishes to 
announce that if any organization 
wishes to secure the use of tho 
Schenley Pool, it may do so by mak
ing the necessary arrangements with 
him.
Mr. Stephen E. Kovach, Jr., 23, 
prominent in musical circles of the 
campus during his college career and 
student director of the Mandolin Club 
for the last four years has been ap-; 
pointed director of the Mandolin Club 
for the coming season.
Under the student directorship of 
Mr. Kovach' the Mandolin Club in con
junction with the Glee Club flourished 
in a most satisfactory manner last 
year.
Concerts were given in Ohio, New 
York, and Pennsylvania which gave 
the club a high position in respect to 
other college organizations of a like 
character.
At the first meeting of the clubs 
last Sunday, probably the largest num
ber of aspirants that the club has ever 
seen were present. There were fifty 
aspirants to the orchestral positions 
and eighty for singing.
The Glee Club under the director
ship of Mr. Edwin P. Rhiel, promises 
a future equally as bright as the Man
dolin Club and plans are under way 
for an exceedingly prosperous year. 
It is rumored that the clubs will give 
joint concerts in Youngstown, Buffalo, 
Cleveland, Erie, Philadelphia, and sev
eral other cities.-
Secretarial Club Holds
First Meeting of Year
On Wednesday, September 26, the 
Margaret Morrison Secretarial Club 
commenced activities for the coming 
year with a tea in honor of its new 
members. Mr. E. V. Page, head ot 
the Secretarial Department, began 
the program with an address of wel
come.
The dizziest of the Dizzy Eight 
Orchestra furnished the music, and 
Bernice Zollars, with her clever reci
tation, furnished the laughter. Many 
new acquaintances were formed and 
all voted a good time.
The clubs program for this year 
is especially interesting and promises 
to be both profitable and enjoyable 
to all the members. The club officers 
are: Faye Glass, president; Adah
Borgerding, vice president; Miriam 
Bond, social chairman; Catherine 
Moren, treasurer, and Sarah Sussman, secretary.

SLIPPERY ROCK WINS 
CLOSE BATTLE, 7-0
Strange things do happen 'neath the midnight sun, and equally strange 
things do happen when the Carnegie Tartan decides to depart from timehonored customs of yore and puts itself onto the campus one day ahead of 
schedule. The most deplorable instance was when part of this column got 
lost from its better half last week and appeared in the most astonishing po- i 
sitions. But the reorganization is complete now, and no further confusion 
is anticipated.

FATHER'S DAY
For many, many years every dog has had his day. But it is regrettable 
to relate that only recently have the fathers of American Youth come to be 
looked upon as deserving of especial recognition, and so now we have a 
new tradition starting at our Institute of Technology.
Fathers Day will be celebrated this year for the first time on the occa
sion of the Carnegie Tech-Lehigh game, November 3. Mr. G. L. Tilbrook, 
aided by a group of students representing the fraternities and dormitories, 
is rapidly shaping plans for the day, details of which will be announced as 
soon as possible.
In the meantime, let the lessons slide and write to Dad. Ask him to 
please come to see his son or daughter, or both, as the case might be. The 
football game will be worth coming many miles for, but besides that there 
are the fraternity and dormitory arrangements for entertaining the Dads, 
and the faculty is holding open house in the different departments.
The movement is not.a new one in the collegiate world. Penn State, 
for example, has a regular Days Association through, which the fathers of 
students retain their interest in the school long after said students have 
graduated or otherwise made their exit.
Come on, everybody! Lets invite Dad around for November thirdAND 
DONT FORGET MOTHER!
THAT SNAKE DANCE AGAIN
Last Saturday at the football game there was a snake dance. It was 
a good snake dance, as snake dances go. But gosh, to an observer from the 
opposite side of the field, the stands looked, almost as full during the dance 
as they did before.
It looked as though the majority of the rooters would rather stay in 
their seats and be cold than start the blood circulating via a little demon
stration -of school spirit. Perhaps the situation could be improved if a | 
method could be devised whereby those who participate in the snake dance 
would be reasonably sure of getting the same seats or equally good ones j 
after the exhibition. We have not thought about that particularly, but offer j 
it as a suggestion that the cheer leaders might work on.
MORE OPPORTUNITY AFOOT
The Cross Country team still needs men. And if it doesn't get some 
men, there will be several perfectly good gray sweaters with nice, bright 
ulaid Cs sewed on the front going begging.
Cornell, according to Coach Guy Halferty, has a cross country squad of 
about 250 men, of which a very large percentage are freshmen. Cornell is 
therefore one of the leaders in the hiU-and-dale sport, and year after year 
turns out championship teams.
Howard Dykeman, now considered one of the foremost distance runners 
of the country, never did any running until he came to Carnegie. Perhaps 
you, little Plebe, may possess the same latent ability. Isnt it worth trying, 
anyway?
SIDELIGHTS
Somebody put something over on the Peunsy for the first time since the 
Bigelow Boulevard slide. It has been forced to reduce the fare to Cleveland 
two cents on the round trip. You can make the trip for a cent cheaper each 
way than you thought you could a week ago!
Some Plebe is now wearing a misfit haircut for showing undue energy 
during the football game Saturday. He is to be commended for his initia
tive, but for choosing the middle of a football game for his grandstand stunt, 
wellthats not so good.
There must have been some outsiders in the students stands last Satur
day who did a lot of booing when Christman, the Thiel halfback, called Sig
nals Over several times. We know they were outsiders because Carnegie 
men have always prided themselves on their good sportsmanship.
It did our hearts good to see Wally Steffen on the bench. It looks to us 
though his problem of the end positions has about been solved.
That forward pass attack of Thiel ought to be of help in our preparation 
for Pitt. And wasnt that some run that Jimmy Robertson made?
Well, now that youve read this column all through, look over on the 
other side of this page and read about Mr. Munliall; we hope to make Plaid 
Personalities a regular feature.
ON TO CLEVELAND!
Battling stubbornly every inch of 
the way, the Plebe football warriors 
of Carnegie Tech were forced down to 
defeat by the Slippery Rock Normal 
aggregation last Saturday. The score 
was 7 to 0.
Defeat it was, but if there is ever 
glory in defeat, the Plebes covered 
themselves with it Saturday, for they 
surprised the heavier, more expe
rienced normal school team by their 
spirit of determination and forced the 
visitors to go scoreless until late in 
the last quarter.
There were almost as many thrills 
as there were in the varsity game 
which followed. (Slippery Rock had 
already defeated Mt. Union, a strong 
Ohio Conference school, and was ex
pected to have things pretty much in 
hand; they found, however, unexpect
ed resistance, and would probably 
have been sent home with a scoreless 
tie result but for the breaks of the 
game.
For the Freshmen, Hamilton played 
a brainy game at quarterback, while 
Manby did some pretty snapping back 
of the ball and defense work. Levin
son, at left end, also made an impres
sion by his consistent playing.
Next week the Plebes travel to 
State College to meet the Penn State 
Freshmen in wliat promises to bo one 
of the best games on the schedule.

The Sklbo machine again launched fin 
attack with Robertson and Brum

With Brummy smashing the line for 6 and 8-yard gains and Robertson cir
cling the ends the ball was soon 
placed on Thiels G-yard line where the 
plucky little captain carried the pig

touchdown. Comfort kicking the goal 
and the half soon ended with the Plaid

The third quarter found many sub

for Carnegie Tech. Bell kicked to 
Brumbaugh who returned it to the 32- 
yard line. Robertson took the pigskin 
himself on the next play and raced 
around right end for G8 yards and a 
touchdown, bringing the roaring 
crowd of spectators to their feet by 
this spectacular feat. Comfort added 
the extra point making the score 28-0.

If you want varaityi basket ball, lot

we have it, show that you meant 
what you said by coming out to the

At last the mens tennis tourua*:
ment is under way. Some of the
matches of the first round have been j 
played off and by the time this article is in print the second round!
will be .well along. From present;
indications the final rounds will find J 
some of the best tenuis of the sea

courts.
The courts at the present time are: 
open to the use of the men and 
women who are in the tournament. 
The two rear courts next the Mar
garet Morrison Building are reserved 
for the girls tournament play.
There is at least another month 
of playing left,, and the courts will 
be kept in condition as long as 
weather permits indulgence in vho 
sport. It is urgentb requested that 
all who wish to play tennis make 
the required payment of two dohriv 
at the cashiers office, and get a club 
membership tag now.
The assistant tennis managers are 
instructed tc ask for membership 
cai^ls from all persons playing on 
the courts. This is only fair to those 
who have paid the fee, and It is re
quested that members have their 
cards with them at all times, when 
they are playing on the courts.
It is well to note that there will 
not be more than one letter man

It is not an uncommon thing for 
us to see in glaring headlines in both 
the school publications and the 
Pittsburgh papers the names of our 
athletic heroes and coaches. We 
have our Steffen, Marks, Irwin, Rob
ertson, Anderson and doaons of 
others whose names are blazoned in 
places where every eye can see. These 
men are prominent in the athletics 
of our institution and lightly so, for 
they have made sport history while 
here; 'but there is oue other who is 
an indispensable cog in the machine, 
but about whom vey little is seen in 
printyet, who, none the less, is 
just as widely and affectionately 
known by friends of the school, both 
on and off the campus. As the read

PLEBES FLY FLAG
WITHOUT RESULTS
Last. Friday the. Freshman clans 
flow a flag with '27 on It from the Hag 
polo in the Arts School front yard. 
The polo was groasod and the ropo 
tied at tho top. The Froshmon com
ing to school winked knowingly, the 
Sophomoroo ga/.ed with mild oyos and 
walked on. About 10 oclock, a school 
official sent a follow to take It down. 
Ho received ton dollars for his serv
ices, contributed from the Freshman 
breakage fund. Moro dorn fun!
The Hug polo is out of bounds of 
the campus and any offenses ngalnst 
it will bo taken up by the Student. 
Council.
Ambitious Plebes can do things that 
will rouse the Sophomoro Ire without 
having to pay for It (In money at | 
least). For instance in the old days, 
the Plebes would l!y a kite; or two,
[ peiliiips, to keep, the Sophs guessing. 
Our fertile brain suggests a hair-cut
ting bee. with the victims tied to the 
senior fence. The whole Freshman 
class might appear witli bright green 
socks and ties.
The Freshman class is proving a 
little more peppy than the average 
run and we expect great things from 
them In the way of entertainment. 
Nothing can bring school spirit quick
er than class rivalry. Got together 
Plebes and give those last year Plebes 
a good scare.
BERT MUNHALL
Bert, as ho hi universally Unown 
here, came to Carnegie back In the 
old days whon we wore Just .strug
gling to got on our foot -on Feb
ruary 10, 1001), lo bo exact, it was 
In I ho spring of that year that Wally 
S toff on first put In an appearance on 
the Plaid Campus, having boon signed 
up by Athletic. Director .1. 11. McCul
lough to coach football and also lake 
charge of spring football training. 
Since that time neither Munhall nor 
Steffen have been missing a single 
season, I hough Wally on mo just for
football, but the former was here 
throughout, the entire year.
It is hardly necessary for us to de
scribe Berts countless duties. All 
of the old students and alumni know 
them fully, and those who just came 
in tills fall will bocomo acquainted 
with them very soon, especially if 
they go out for athletics, for Bert 
bears the official title of trainer. It 
matters not if,you are out for footiball, baseball, basket ball, track or 
what-not. if you need attention Bert 
is always on the job. After manyj years at that profession he liua aci quired such a high degree of offij ciency il is doubtful that any school 
| in the state can boast of a hotter 
j physical trainer. And Bert does not 
take care of the athletes only, but 
the students in general as well. It 
has become quite the habit for the 
older students to consult Bert if any
thing is wrong with them. That ho 
gets results both on and off the 
lield is evident. He believes in keep
ing the boys in good condition, and 
in that way lessening the chances of 
injury, it will be noted that not one 
of the football players wore injured 
in the game against Toledo over aweek ago; not. once did Bert have to 
go out on the field to give first aid 
to a fallen warrior.
One of .MunhaHs important duties, 
and one which the student body in 
general does not know about is that 
of overseer of the football training 
camp. For the past four years Bert 
has had charge of the food and the 
sleeping quarters. He did the buying 
and oversaw the cooking of the food 
and was in complete charge of the 
dining room. Last year, when a sur
veyors camp was established at 
Camp* Loulso Carnegio, Glenqalrn, 
Bert had similar dutios there. The 
camp was held early .in the summer, 
and while there Bert planted an upto-date truck garden. Football train
ing was held there later, and the 
boys had plonty of vegetables right 
from Bert's garden. After camp 
broke up, there was a whole triick 
load left which was brought to Pitts
burgh. Also, at athletic banquets 
and similar functions Bort Is usually 
called upon to ovorsoo things In gonoral.
It might, he stated at this time that 
Munhall was qulto an athlete him
self back. In the old days, oven 
though he Is a Mttlo ovorwelght. just 
now. He playod center, guard and 
tackle at various times throughout 
his career. Ho was a member of the 
championship1 ilornestoadi Steel Works 
team In 01), MO and Ml, iMe also was 
one of the. mainstays of tho strong 
'Sltdrllngs of WTlklnsburg who made 
such an enviable record at that time. 
And oven today Bort shows his athlotlo ability and strength by success
fully holding his own In a wrestling 
tussle with some of the big men on 
the football squad.'
Steffen andi Munhall came to Car
negie Took at. about, the same time. 
It. begins to look as though SteflVm 
will not bo with us many moro years. 
Lot us hope, however, that Bert will 
not leave us for a long, long I,lino 
to come.

It Is expected that men, here In the

had no college education but have 
been working at a trade and in the 
industries for some time, will take 
short courses pertaining to their par

will be made to give short courses in 
both the day and night schools. These 
courses will be a great asset to the 
business man in the industrial world.

"Adventure was successfully pre-J

Tuesday of last week, a the Allendale 
Theater in Buffalo. The play was per
formed chiefly) for delegates of the 
Nutional Sufety Council, covening in 
Buffalo, and all the performunces <

delegates, hailing from other parts, 
were so favorably impressed with 
the play, that they huve ulreudy be

"Adventure' was received in Buffulo, 
bodes well for its success wherever 
it muy be presented.
It ;s not likely that Adventure 
will be presented again at the Little 
Theater. In all probability1 it will

We Carnegie Tech Dramats were 
as well received in Buffalo as wa3 
their pluy. The Safety Council had 
arranged for suites of rooms at the 
Touraine Hotel and had overlooked 
nothing for the comfort and conven
ience of the company. A rehearsal 
was held Sundajr at the theater, but 
on the fplloAving day a bus and. sev
eral private cars were sent around 
to the hotel, and the bunch piled in 
and took a trip to Canada and Niag
ara Falls. Most of the optimistic 
members of the company were highly 
disappointed to learn that lower Can
ada is just us dry us the United 
Stutes.

with your roommate at the focal 
point. See what the man can develop 
you into, and see whether your face 
is fit to print. If not, get to work 
and clean it up. Touch up the dark 
spots, and polish - down the rough 
edges, using a bit of emery cloth to 
take out the wrinkles. A sousing in 
hot water, with a dash of creme before 
bed will help to bring about a rosy 
dawn. Try it, instead of powder the 
next time.
Would you like to be called the 
most beautiful girl on the campus? 
Certainly you would, and so would 
your roommate. There is a chance for 
some real competition. Appoint a 
judge, and keep working for a week 
to see which one will be the prettier 
at the end of that time. It puys to 
pick a judge who is not prejudiced. 
Inasmuch as the question has been 
asked as to your beauty, it is high 
time that you ask yourself the same 
question, but change the person. 
Every time you pass a store window, 
look into it and ask yourself "Am I 
beautiful? If not, "there's a reason. 
But there is also a remedy. Watch 
for the revelations in the forthcoming

stuff.

Musical Clubs Have 
Few Open Dates Left
Engagements Now Being 
Made for Coming Season
The Musical Clubs ure booking en
gagements now for the coming season. 
Why/not engage them for a concert 
under the auspices of your clan, or 
perhaps plan a meeting, open to the 
public, in one of your local hotels 
with the Carnegie Musical Clubs as 
the feature number of the program? 
Something of this sort will advertise 
Carnegie far more than any amount 
of literature or catalogues. The clubs 
carry an excellent dance orchestra, 
so that arrangements could be made 
for a dance after the concert.
Several of the clans tried this sug
gestion last year with such success 
that they have already made return 
engagements for this year. They 
found that they got out a lot of Car
negie men and women who had not 
been attending clan meetings, as well 
as a number of prospective students 
who were interested in Carnegie.
Try it, Clans'. You will get the big
gest and livliest turnout of the year 
if you put on the Carnegie Musical 
i Clubs as a special attraction for one of 
your meetings.

Write Out 
Their Ideas
The dlscrepeucy in the above table 
and the Student's Handbook is duo to 
the fact that this table shows a com
parative registration for the pust ten 
yxjars, as of October 1 each year. 
The Handbook figures show the com
plete yearly registration including the 
second semester and all late regis
trants, and1 is therefore much larger 
than the above table shows.
From a stldy of the table, it will 
be seen that while there has been 
quite a bit of discussion on the 
campus regarding the fall-off in regis
tration this year, there is really not 
a very great decrease. What there is,
is rather for the good of the student 
body, for it must be admitted that 
in the past the various classes have 
been somewhat overcrowded. This 
decrease in enrollment will more than 
likely mean more personal attention 
to each student, which in turn ought 
to work towards better and more in
teresting courses.
