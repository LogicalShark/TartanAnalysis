NEW COACH OF 
CARNEGIE FIVE

Coach Forced To Leave

BROTHER OF NEW
COACH TO ASSIST
Large Turnout Promises Big 
Season. Plebe Coach Has 
Good Prospects
Mr. David H. Byerly will coach the 
Varsity Basketball team at Carnegie 
this year, succeeding Ben Lubic who 
has been forced to drop basketball be
cause of continued ill-health.
Mr. Byerly is a graduate of Annapo
lis Naval Academy of the class of '21. 
As an undergraduate student he played 
with one of the best basketball teams 
the Naval Academy has ever produced.
After graduation Dave served in the 
Navy, and in this period he travelled 
to all corners of the globe. After his 
period' of service expired in the Navy, 
he was offered the position of assist
ant basketball coach at Washington 
and Jefferson. He accepted, and, as 
assistant to his brother John (then 
Head Coach at Washington and JefD. H. BYERLY
ferson), he aided in producing some 
good squads. The fact that they have 
defeated Carnegies basketball teams 
consistently, especially the strong 
team we had last year, should be 
enough proof that the brothers are 
capable in their work.
At present Mr. Byerly is holding 
the position of Manager of Food Pro
ducts in the Industrial Department of 
the Westinghouse" Elect ic and Manu
facturing Companys East Pittsburgh 
Plant.
Dave will be assisted in his duties 
at Carnegie by his brother John, a 
graduate of Washington and Jeffer
son and Head Basketball Coach there 
for the last four years.
The work of selecting men for the 
Varsity and Plebe squads was begun 
yesterday with a large turnout. With 
Captain Amans, Conrad, Lynch, Beede, 
and Cook back from last years Varsity, and Sebastian, Ritts, and Cowan 
of last years Freshman squad, pros
pects for the coming basketball season 
look unusually bright.
However, the Varsity is in need of 
tall men for the center position, and 
Coach Byerly asks that all eligible sixfooters report to the new Gymnasium

M. M. GUILD CARNIVAL 
TO BE HELD ON DEC. 11
Tomorrow night students of the 
Drama Department will present 
Thomas Wood Stevens pageant The 
Smith for the Allegheny Civic Club, 
on the occasion of their thirteentn an
niversary. The pageant was origi
nally produced five years ago, so it 
has been brought up to date since. Its 
purpose is to show the condition in 
Pittsburgh previous to the founding 
of the Civic Club, and the subsequent 
reforms that were brought about. The 
subject is treated allegorically, aDd 
yet done so adroitly that the interest 
never flags.
Much care has been taken in the 
production, technical details in par
ticular. The stage will be set in four 
levels, in the manner of the new Con
tinental theaters. The lighting also 
will play an important part. The 
work on the pageant explains the ap
parent inactivity of the Department in 
the Arts Theater.
In return for their services, the 
Civic Club will donate to the Drama 
scholarship fund.
The pageant is being directed by 
Professor Chester Wallace, assisted by 
Mable Eichler. The cast is as follows:

The Annual Carnival of the Carne
gie Women's Guild Association will be 
held on Friday, December 11. The 
committee for the affair has decided 
that this years program will be in the 
form of an ice carnival. Final plans 
for the evening are rapidly nearing 
completion.
The Guild is endeavoring to finance 
a Fresh Air Camp for children of the 
Forward Avenue District. The com
mittee is at present looking for a 
suitable location for the camp, which 
will be known as Camp Carnegie. 
Vassar and other leading colleges for 
women have philanthropic organiza
tions similar to the Guild.
The program for this year promises 
to be as interesting as that of last 
year, according to officers of the Guild. 
The girls are trying to arouse interest 
by wider advertising, and hope that 
the entire school will give their sup
port to the project. The Alumnae of

Pennsylvania, a large number from 
other sections of the country have 
signified their intention of attending. 
Among the institute students," will 
be representatives from the Universi
ties of Illinois, Yale, Purdue and Ken
tucky and the International Corre
spondence School. They will study 
the institute with reference to possi
ble establishment of institutes at their 
schools for the benefit of the plumb
ing industries in their section of the 
country.
As a result of the innovation of a 
special program for the women dur
ing the Institute, approximately a hun
dred men will be accompanied by 
their wives and other women rela
tives. The program for the women 
will be given under the direction of 
the members of the faculty of Mar

cafeterias.
The session at 2 o'clock will begin 
the practical lectures and demonstra-r 
tions. Lectures on "Boiler Ratings"

Department of Heating, Ventilating 
and Sanitation, and Water Supply 
by Prof. Harold L. Lang, Department 
of Biology and Public Health. Follow
ing dinner in the Carnegie Commons, 
the men, accompanied by their wives, 
will make an inspection trip through 
Carnegie during night school.
Wednesdays program will include

pat, Librarian of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology.
To a combined assembly of men and 
women, motion pictures on Saving 
'Coal at Home and Ventilation 
Tests for Underground Tunnels will 
be shown through the co-operation of 
the United States Bureau of Mines.
Contracts and Liens by Clyde 
Armstrong, a Pittsburgh attorney at

lants, and an open forum of discus(Continued on Page Two.)
CARNEGIANS WILL
FURNISH MUSIC FOR
JUNIOR TEA DANCE
Tomorrow afternoon, between 
4:30-6:00, the combined Junior 
classes are holding a tea dance 
in the Union. The music will 
be furnished by the Carnegians, 
the orchestra that has proven it
self so capable in the past, both 
at other tea dances and at the 
Saturday night football dances. 
Admission for men students is 
twenty-five cents; co-eds will be 
admitted free as usual.
This is the second of a series 
of tea dances which are to be 
given by the combined Junior 
classes. The first was held 
about a month ago and proved 
to be successful. However, with 
the Carnegians dispensing their 
well-liked brand of music, this 
'lance will more likely than not 
be well attended. If this dance 
shows a profit, another tea 
dance will be held in the near 
future with the same excellent 
quality of music as a headliner.
By a fortunate combination of cir
cumstances, Dr. Baker was able to se
cure as speaker at the first faculty as
sembly, Dr. James C. M. Garnett, 
Dean of the faculty of technology in 
the University of Manchester, Englaud. Dr. Garnett spoke before the 
Hungary Club at the Fort Pitt Hotel 
yesterday, and will address the stu
dents of this school in the Union at 
11:30 today.
Dr. Garnett is best known as the 
author of Education and World Citi
zenship. In this book he states very 
clearly with a breadth of comprehen
sion that sots him forth as one of tho 
foremost present day educators, tho 
aims and ideals of education. A study 
of this work would have rewarded any 
student struggling with his mid-semester examinations last week.
Dr. Garnett is at present oxecutivo 
secretary of the Leaguo of Nations 
Union in Great Britain which has two 
thousand branches and a membership 
of 475,000. He is the author of nu
merous papers on scientific subjects, 
which have been published in the Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society and in 
the British Journal of Psychology, in 
addition to his papers on education.
He is distinguished in Great Britain 
for his notable work in astronomy,

R. O. T. C. RIFLE CONTEST
FOR CUP ENDS THIS WEEK

WINS CONTEST 
BY 26-0 SCORE
Entire Hoosier Lineup is 
Changed in Second and 
Fourth Quarters
QUALITY OF SUBS
BOOSTS SCORING
Beede, Goodwin and Bastian 
Outstanding Stars in 
Plaids Defeat
Major Taylor of the local corps of 
the R. O. T. C., in order to stimulate 
interest in Rifle shooting among tho 
personnel of the R. O. T. C., has of
fered a cup, to be competed for by 
the men of the corps. The contest 
closes Saturday, November 21.
The Marksmanship cup offered by 
Major Taylor is being competed for by 
groups of ten men each. The group 
having the best composite score from 
both kneeling and standing positions 
will receive the cup.
The competition for the cup is caus
ing keen rivalry among the various 
squads of the corps, and as a logical 
result the marksmanship of the men 
is bound to improve. As an indirect 
result the Rifle Team will probably 
benefit materially * from interesting 
men who otherwise might not con
sider trying out.
Before the largest crowd that ever 
saw a game in the Notre Dame Stad
ium, Carnegie went down to defeat 
before Rccknes new edition of the 
"Four Horsemen. Tho final score 
was 26-0, five points larger than the 
margin between the teams last year. 
Saturday was Home-coming Day at 
Notre Dame, and with thousands of 
old Alumni in tho stands cheering 
wildly for their idols, the team went 
on the field with a determination to 
score an overwhelming victory. The 
Notre Dame offense was the best It 
has been all soason. Their interfer
ence was almost perfect, and their de
fense was air tight.
The game started with Notre Dames 
second team in tho line-up. They 
played the entire first quarter but were 
not able to penetrate tho Tartan de
fense for a score. Early In the socond 
period came an Irish mlsplay that 
caused Rockne to sond in his first 
team. Cowan had recovered a Hoosier 
fumble on his 12-yard lino, and when 
the count stood at four and sovon 
yards to go, the first team was rushod 
on the field. Carnoglo punted to tho 
Blue and Yellow on tho Skibos 32- 
yard lino. Tho stands wore calling 
wildly for Notre Dame to start down 
the field for a touchdown, but their 
time had not yot come.
Tho Tartan defense hold tho Irish 
for three downs, and Notro Dame de
cided to try a placomont. kick. En
rights kick was wldo and short, tho 
ball falling In tho arms of Bastian on 
his fourteen-yard lino. Carnoglo could 
not do a thing against tho Notro Danio 
dofonse, and Bastian punted to Ed
wards who returned It to tho 32-yard 
lino. On tho next play Flaimagan, 
star of the Bluo and Gold baokfleld, 
ran around right end for 22 yards and 
first down on tho Tartan 10-yard line.
After two llneplays that gained 
about two yards. Flaunagan again took 
the ball. This tlmo he wont off loft, 
tackle for eight yards and tho South 
Benders first touchdown. Enright at
tempted to kick goal but ho was nor 
successful, his kick going wldo. Thin 
ended tho scoring for this period, hut 
not without a groat dofonslvo game on 
tho part of tho Tartans.
Tho socond half oponod with Buslinn kicking off to Enright on his own 
85-yard lino. Notro Da mo then pro
ceeded to make a first down, but after 
this they wore thrown for a loss on 
tho noxt three plays. Enright, was 
forcod to punt, tho hall going out or 
bounds on tho 19-yard lino. Goodwin 
made a yard at right end. Bastian 
made another yard at center. On tho 
noxt play Boodo made a lateral pass 
to Bastian who gained first down on 
his 85-yard lino. This was Carnegies 
Initial first down. The Sklbos failed 
to gain on their noxt three plays and 
Bastian punted to Edwards. Three 
Tartan tacklers downed him in his 
tracks.
The Irish then started a march 
down the field that resulted In their 
second score. Enright and Hearden 
would make a couple yards through 
the line, and then Flannagan would 
i make it first down. After a run of 22 
yards by Flannagan, it was Notre 
Dames ball on Carnegies six-yard 
line. On the next play Enright hur
dled through center for their second 
touchdown. Edwards attempted drop 
kick failed. This ended the scoring 
in the third period.
Shortly after the fourth quarter 
started, Edwards punted to Bastian, 
who fumbled, and McMamon recov
ered for Notre Dame on the Skibos 
34-yard line. This break gave the 
Irish another touchdown for in six 
plays they had scored their third

H. Pfeiffer, and Garnet Phillips, Rose 
iPolIytechnical Institute, and II. F. Mc
Cullough.
Beginning with the college year 
j 1921-22, investigations through Re
search Fellowships have been carried 
on in co-operation with the U. S. Bu
reau of Mines and Mining and Metal| Iurgical Advisory Boards. The work
is devoted to various problems in coal 
mining, utilization of fuels, and iron 
and steel metallurgy.
Graduates of approved Institutions 
are eligible for the Fellowships. Ad
vanced degrees In engineering will be 
granted upon Hatlsfactory completion 
of an approved course of study, which 
Includes Investigations and presenta
tion of a thesis which Is published by 
the co-operating parties. Each Fellow
ship carries a stipend of $750, paid in 
ten installments. The Institute, or 
industry, provides the Fellows, tho 
Bureau of Mines furnishes the labora
tory facilities and supervises the In
vestigation and the Advisory Boards 
determine what problems a^je to be un
dertaken and publish the reports.
The yearly programs are planned 
so there is an even balance between 
purely scientific and. industrial prob
lems. The majority of the investiga
tions have been carried on In the lab
oratories of the Bureau of MlneB. On 
the other hand, in a number of ca3es,
research and study have been carried 
on in mines or mills under actual 
working conditions. Gratifying re
sults have been achieved by the in 
vestlgations during tho past four 
years and the work is showing steady 
development. The Investigations ap 
I ply to problems actually bearing on 
industrial operations and serve to ex
tend the scopo of the Department of 
Mining and Metallurgy; to plaeo 
greater facilities within the reach of 
the undergraduates, and to bring tho 
co-operating partlos into closer rolaI tion and contact,

Arts Graduate to
Study in France
J. Denton Hogan to Spend 
Year Abroad in Study
J. Denton Hogan, a graduate of tho 
Carnegie Arts School and a resident 
of Harrisburg, has recently gone to 
France with the intention of spend
ing a year there studying painting.
While a student ut Carnegie, Hogan 
won tho J, IIIi. Porter prize for pro
gress for four successive yeurs; the 
Fontainebleau, France, and the T. C. 
Tiffany Foundation Scholarship1, which 
gave him three months study on 
Long Island.
By capturing tho Fontainebleau 
Scholarship, Hogan won the distinc
tion of 'being tiio only Junior ut Car
negie to receive tills awurd. It was 
also the first time tho award went to 
un urtist. In addition, Hogan has 
exhibited nine paintings in the Carne
gie Art Museum exhibit. He is a 
World War veteran, having served 
with the Infantry in. tho Seventyeighth Division.
MAIN STREET FOLKS 
WANT SERIOUS PLAYS 
SURVEY DISCLOSES
Do the folks on Main 'Street want 
serious drama? William A. Brady, fa
mous not only as a producer, but also 
us the husband of Grace George und 
the father of Alice Brady, says they
do. At least, he told the Ways and
Means Committee of the House of Rep
resentatives so In Washington recent
ly adding, Incidentally, tliut musical 
comedies, sex plays, ticket scalpers, 
and Federal admission taxes are driv
ing classical drama out of existence.
Mr. Brady bus many supporters. 
The Carnegie Institute of Technology 
also appoars to suspect that all is not 
right in tho sticks." At least, that
much is gathered from its report of a
widespread interest in tho National 
Conference 011 the American Theater 
which President Thomas S. Baker bus 
culled for Novomber 27 und 28 in 
Pittsburgh.
Instead of opinions, however, the 
Carnegie authorities cite some impos
ing figures to indicate that the Main 
Street sections of the country are so 
much interested in serious drama than 
they are providing it for themselveB 
rather than depending upon un occusionul Broadway producer who bus 
enough courage to send a road com
pany to compete with the movies, tho 
musical comedies, etc, Tho story in 
lltfiiroH Is told In the report of a sur
vey recently undortukon showing that 
there are more than a thousand com
munity playhouses and little theater 
groups In this country, moro than hull 
of whleh uro comparatively uctivo.
Of -110 American colleges and uni
versities responding to 11 questionnaire I 
sent by President Baker, according to 
tho report, OH per cent replied that 
they give courses In dramatic art for 
whleh college credit Is given. Of this 
group, 1.52 maintain organized depart
ments In either drama or speech. A 
further Indication of the Interest In 
drama among the collbgos Is reflected 
In the report that M0, or Hourly 811 
per cent of the institutions replied 
1 lmi they havo student organizations 
which produce serious plays.
To just what extent Mr. Brady's 
contention is true that, tho folks on 
Main Street long for the drama is 
to bo one of tho Important purposes 
of tho theater conference tills month. 
It Is universally agreed, the an
nouncement of the conference points 
out, that there are regenerative 
forces ut work in the American thea
ter. These are centered in the Little 
and Community theaters and the dramatic activities of the universities and 
colleges. The purpose of the confer
ence is to review the situation, to ob
tain u just estimate of what has so 
far been accomplished, and finally, to 
endeavor to give cohesion to the move
ment.
Consistent with their viewpoint that 
there are two closely related move
ments, the one among the community 
and the little theaters, and the other 
among the colleges, the Carnegie offi
cials have planned the conference pro
gram to include one session of a gen
eral nature, one to consider dramatic 
training in colleges and universities, 
and a third to study the little theaters 
and community playhouses.

We are very glad to note the in
creased activities of the Clans which 
has been making itself evident re
cently. During the first part of the 
season, little was heard from them, 
but now they are coming back with a 
vengeance. They are backing their 
Alma Mater to the limit. For in
stance, witness the reception which 
the Youngstown Clan gave Mike and 
Dyke on October 26. Carnegie ap
preciates this sort of spirit. It gives 
evidence of the fact that Carnegie 
extends far beyond the little group 
of buildings in Schenley Park. Its 
influence reaches, perhaps, to the ut
termost parts of the world.
Then again, read the account given 
in the Clan News for this week in re
gard to the activities of the Cleveland 
Clan. Pay particular attention to the 
fact that a committee has been form
ed to promote the interests of the en
dowment fund in this territory. Would 
it not be possible for other clans to 
do the same thing?

PLEBES DEFEAT 
CALIFORNIA 7-6
Harpster and Limeric Make 
Skibos Lone Touchdown 
in Seasons Final
The Plebes ended a most successful 
season last Saturday by defeating r.he 
rough and ready California Normal 
team 7-6. The score .doesnt begin to 
justify the game, for the Plebes played 
rings around their opponents. The 
Harpster-Limeric combination reached 
its zenith in this struggle when Harp
ster shot out a long pass that floated 
down into Limerlcs arms enabling 
this speedy gentleman to leave his op
ponents staring at his fast disappear
ing heels. A sure eye and a pretty 
kick enabled Harpster to sew up the 
game for the yearlings.
Coach Jimmy Anderson deserves 
much credit for whipping this bunch 
of sturdy youngsters into the splendid 
team they are. Every game a victory, 
with the single exception of a G-6 tie 
with the Pitt Freshies, speaks for 
itself. It is now only a matter of time 
to see what Wally Steffen and Bob 
Waddell can do with this exceptional 
material next year. Sport critics all 
agree that the Plebe squad, is un
doubtedly the outstanding freshman 
team of the Western Pennsylvania 
district.
It is almost impossible to pick any 
individual stars of the year but the 
names of Stauffer, Melzinger, Lovewell, Leitzinger, Harpster, Crum, and 
Limeric tower just a bit over the 
others. * The entire squad had the 
teamwork and coordination that would 
have done credit to a much older and 
more experienced team. And the best 
part of it is that very, very few of the 
boys are falling down scholastically, 
but for the most part are showing the 
world whats -what both in classroom 
and on the field. The lineup:

WITH THE TEAM ON 
THE NOTRE DAME TRIPMMMMMMM
By B. J. K.
In order that my efforts may not be 
misinterpreted, I pause to say thatj 
this little tabloid novel does not touch 
on matters of sense or common sense. 
It is designed to put before your eyes 
such matters of moment as may In
terest those of you who indulge, in 
such slightly pungent affairs. The 
tale is written at the request of no 
one, but merely to verify or flatter 
the writers ego and to pass the time 
away. We humans are a queer conglbmeration, and the findings herein 
recorded bear out that belief. On 
Horatio!
Let me begin to start to commence 
at the outset. The first scene is laid 
at the Union Station. The main ac
torsthe members of the team and 
the coaches are beginning to assemble 
train time is approaching. In one 
groupright tackle Yoder is seen to 
visably starthis eyes and mouth reg
ister amzaement in the best dramatic 
manner. His lips formulate words, 
but none are audible. He trembles 
with nervousness and then moistens 
his lips. Oh! He speaksMy suit 
he cries. All eyes are now upon him. 
He must be wronghe is wearing his 
suit. We follow the direction of his 
eyesthen another cry"My shoes' 
this time from Meyers. The cause 
of the disturbance is located. Yoders 
suit and Meyers shoes are seen adorning the person of a total stranger. 
Legal pressure is brought to bear and 
the clothes are returned to their 
proper owners. Talk about luck!
Did you ever try to sleep in a sleep
ing car? Well, some did and some 
didnt. Many points of interest were 
discoveredin the mattresses and on 
all sides. Heads and faces were useti 
as stepping stones for upper berths. 
Some marvelous engineering facts 
were accomplished and some humor
ous stunts were perpetrated. Imagine 
having your shoes exchanged, socks 
knotted and ties misplaced. However, 
the climax to this second act came 
in the morning when-a grand rush to 
the wash room was in order. The con
fusion at Babylon had nothing on this 
melee. Wash bowls were at a pre
mium, and standing room was soiling 
at a L'orty per cent advance. Tooth 
brushes and towels were the chief 
decorative effects. The tooth brush 
was found at various uses. As we all 
IcnoAvfor matters of sanitation, they 
are our own personal property. Well, 
it seemed that mouths and teeth were 
misplaced and in the confusion of arms 
and mouthsany old set would do. 
Necks were scrubbed and hair 
brushed- Utility is the modern pass
word. So ends the second act.
The third act opens at the Mis
hawaka Hotel at Mishawaka, Indiana. 
This is outside of South Bend and was 
destined to be our resting place. Oh! 
yes, we ate our meals there also.

scene all decked out like a Polish

J. A. C. FOLLER
NOTRE DAME
Not "Four Horsemen but "Eleven Horsement frequently mounting 
fresh steeds, rode through the Plaid lineup for four touchdowns last Satur
day. It was largely a contest between the respective linesmen. Seldom did 
the Notre Dame secondary defense participate in the bringing down of a 
Carnegie runner: it wasnt often that he got that far. After watching four 
periods of the kind of football that the South Benders displayed, it was 
hard to realize that they had been beaten this season, or even tied. What 
hopes of victory the Tartans had entertained were dispelled shortly after the 
second quarter began and the entire Notre Dame first team was brought 
from the sidelines.
Coach Knute Rockne made the following statement after the game: 
Carnegie Tech played better and cleaner football than any team we have 
met this season.
The Special proved itself a great success. It carried a capacity load 
both going to and returning from South Bend. Sevei-al passengers took ad
vantage of the discovery that a Pullman lias three berths instead of but 
two, an upper, a lower, and a lowest.
THE PLEBE CHAMPIONS
Now that the last of its opponents has been put away, the Plebe cham
pionship aggregation is to be dissolved, and will not play any football until 
the spring training period begins. The Freshmen deserve much credit and 
praise for going through the hard schedule that they had without suffering a 
defeat, and encountering but one tie game. The way things look at present 
there will be many new faces in the varsity lineup next season.
CARNEGIE VS. GEORGETOWN
The cross-country team won from Georgetown because of the fact that 
one of the Washington men evaded a hurdle on the course and was dis
qualified. Carnegies runners were near enough to the top. however, so that 
the elimination of one of the opponents gave the meet to the Plaid. Next 
week the team goes to Geneva.
Our Kiltie Band gave an impromptu concert on the train last Friday 
night, at the request of several of the alumni.
The Theta Xi football team defeated the Kappa Sigma eleven in the 
Bowl on Armistice Day. The entire game was just one upset after another.

WHOS WHO IN FOOTBALL
Ben Kristof, former Johnstown 
High football luminary, is the- only 
member of this year's team who has 
played four years of Varsity ball for 
Carnegie. Bon has always been a 
strong point in the line He first 
gained a reputation as a tackle. In 
his Sopoliomore year, Coach Steffen 
developed him into an end, ono of the 
best ever to play for the Plaid. In 
fact, Ben was given Honorable Men
tion by Walter Camp when the late 
sport critic chose his 1923 mythical 
All-American team.
Kristof will ever be remembered by 
Carnegie Alumni and undergraduates 
for his superb playing against Pitt 
two years ago. It was "Benny who 
caught the long pass that paved the 
way to the Tartan victory. Kristof 
has been very active on the Campus. 
Ho is a member of the Senior Council 
and iias served on numerous class 
committees. During last years Cam
pus Week, lie was Chairman of the 
Sweepstakes Committee. He is also 
a member of the Tartan Sports Staff.
Kristof is a senior in tho Industries 
(School, studying printing; he is a 
member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fra
ternity, and belongs to the Druid and 
Dragon Honoraries.
William Manby, varsity center, has 
been one of Carnegios outstanding 
stars since entering the institution. 
Bill came to Carnegie in tho fall of 
1923, to study Machine Production in 
tho School of Industries. Bill proved 
himself a very capable captain of Car
negies first Freshman team.
The next season found him in the 
varsity center position. Manby has 
been ono of the strong points on the 
line, and has been playing consistent, 
ball during both his years on the var
sity squad.
Besides being prominent as a foorball player, Bill has taken a big part 
In Campus non-athlotio activities, in 
addition bo serving on numerous class 
committees, lie has been appointed 
chairman of this yoars Junior Prom.
Manby comes from Lancaster, Pa., 
and b a member of the Phi Kappa Psi 
fraternity and Delta Skull, tho junior 
honorary.
Much progress has been made in the 
past week on tho development of the 
Carnegie swimming teams. ' Coach 
Beukema has his mou in the pool al
most daily, and is busy teaching them 
the "tricks of the trade. The onthu-' 
siasm of those seeking a berth on the 
teams, speaks well of the interest 
shown this year in the new sport a: 
Carnegie. The Tartans have every
thing to desire in the way of proper 
swimming facilities, and others who 
have any pool ability are urged to 
take advantage of these offerings
Conch Beukma when interviewed last 
seemed well pleased with both Fresh
man and Varsity squads. I-Ie believes 
that there is a lot of good material in 
school, and hopes that more will be
come interested in the sport. The 
schedule, which is not yet completed, 
calls for many strong opponents.
The pool in the new Gym has boon 
reserved, for the varsity and freshman 
squads as follows: Monday and Fri
day, -1:15 to 0:00; Wednesday, 5:00 
to 0:00. Those who have any inclina
tion to assist for tho good of Carnegie, 
together with a bit of swimming 
ability are uirged to report immedi

SUMMARY OF DEAN JEWETTS 
REPORT ON THE INVESTI
GATION OF ENGINEER
ING EDUCATION
(Continued From Last Week.)
If basic aptitudes could be deter
mined with a reasonable degree of 
accuracy before specialized study Is 
jbegnn, many of the deplorable and 
much too numerous cases of occupa
tional misfits would be averted. "We 
should develop a practical vocational 
guidance technique, and a personnel 
trained in it. Then the student should 
have the benefit of this vocational 
guidance at two or three times during 
his school life.
High character and ability In the 
teaching force are, naturally, of primary Importance. Going still further 
Dean Jewett concludes from his in
vestigation, that those who undertake 
to train young men for the extremely 
complex and exacting industrial field, 
must possess that first-hand knowl
edge which is acquired only through 
actual experience of considerable 
length.
in many, many cases teachers are 
paid too littleoften not too little for 
their ability, but too little to attract 
men with the ability they should have. 
The greatest need of technological 
education Is for a larger proportion of 
thoroughly qualified instructors. 
College engineering curricula are
Last wook workmon were noflood

holders on various special occasions 
such as Carnogio Day, Campus Woolc, 
otc. The standards are long onough 
to hold the avorage four by six flag. 
To prevent dirt from accumulating I11 
the holes, caps have boen placed on 
the pipes while they are not I11 use. 
On gala days. 11 the future, the Car

touch of nearly seventy United States

not planned to provide for the fact 
that over 60 per cent of the graduate-3 
as a whole in Industry are in other 
than strictly technical positions. The 
problems of manufacture, operation, 
labor, finance, and marketing are 
equally important to those of techni
cal development, design, and engineer
ing testing. The engineer who con
fines himself to the narrower field 
should not complain when the larger 
or at least the higher ranked posi
tions, go to others. The so-called In
dustrial engineering courses are too 
few in number and too recently estab
lished to have had, so far, any great 
effect upon this condition."
Some of the more advanced portions 
of certain technological and mathematicl courses of instruction might 
well be sacrificed to permit of the in
clusion of subjects valuable in the so
lution of industrial relations prob
lems affecting the personnel.
Primarily, industry requires the 
most thorough possible education In 
fundamentals. The available time In 
a four-year course Is too precious to 
waste on things the industry will pay 
the graduate to learn, or things he can 
pick up himself. An Inclination to 
study must be instilled In hima 
comprehension of what he needs moot 
to learn, a knowledge of sources of In formation, and, In fact, the ability to 
carry forv/ard hio own development In 
the fields of his greatest Inclination. 
His educational foundations must be 
laid in college in a thorough and woll 
balanced fashion. The superstructure 
he must largely build himself. En
gineering applications or industrial ap
plications should not consume his col
lege years, but his Instruction should 
proceed in a logical manner, working 
from the known to the unknown, from 
the concrete to the abstract."

A TRIBUTE TO HOSPITALITY
Notre Dame has again demonstrated her great
nessnot in the trampling down of another op
ponent but in the welcoming oJ! her rivals. The 
; cordiality accorded by all South Bend to the Car
negie eleven and its followers has established a 
tender regard for the Irish in .Skibo tradition.
As visitors we were not met by the tolerance of 
a bored or amused townspeople bearing the 80- 
you re-hcre-again  attitude of resignation nor 
the back-slapping of one chamber of commerce 
greeting another from a rival city. The reception 
was quiet and dignified. We are.of South Bend 
and Notre Dame was their impie boast and 
their generous attention to Carnegie gave the 
words an eloquence that a thousand specious 
vaunts could never possess.
The Tartans were received as guests, not as 
invaders, and were tendered all the courtesies 
which the former status demands. The Studebaker Corporation deserves special mention for 
its kindness. And the leavetaking was the parting of friends.
Notre Dame comcs to Pittsburgh next year. 
Let us then show that we are also gentlemen, not 
by reserving a warm welcome for Notre Dame 
alone, but by greeting every team with the smile 
of the host and not the hotel clerk.
A PRAISE AND A CAUTION
The Plebe eleven closed its season Saturday 
with an enviable record. It has not only lost no 
games but not even its severest critics can charge 
it with any moral defeats. In every battle the 
Plebes have come out on top.
Jimmy Andersons coaching deserves much 
credit. It is true that he had wonderful material 
to work with, yet the teams' success is a tribute to 
Andersons coaching ability.
The men themselves have shown remarkable 
spirit. At no time have they become overconfi
dent through the victories they achieved, and in 
the classroom and on the campus they have dis
played the same willing attitude that has so 
marked their attack on the turf.
Plebes, we take off our hats to you, but remem
ber: YOURE A DAMN LONG "VVAY FROM 
THROUGH YET!

HOLD^ORTH
A HEART TO HEART DISCUSSION WITH THE DEAN, FOLLOWING THE MID-SEMESTER EXAMS.
THE PUBLICS MANNA
The enthusiasm with which we await the Na
tional Theater Conference tends to detract from 
the significance of the Second Annual Plumbing 
and Heating Institute, which convenes at Car
negie today.
In several ways, the Institute is moro important 
than the Conference. True, there is no compari
son between the two as advertising media, though 
the direct benefits ol! the former, concerned as 
it is with the industrial life ol the Pittsburgh dis
trict, in part offsets iliis difference,
America has long sulTered l!rom over-competi
tion and over-production. Bargaining, and swift, 
crushing enterprise, at first a game, an open competition ol wit, has with the passing of years, ol! 
decades, and finally ol centuries, resulted in a 
business strategy so complex that the tradesman 
and industrial loader has lost all personal froodom, is chained to his desk, and grows grayhaired over night in the mad battle for lile and a 
home unthreatoned by mortgages and liens.
Under such conditions, how could A morion de
velop an appreciation for art and culturo? She 
had no leisure time for true devotion lo such im
provement in the American theater and studio as 
it was possible to accomplish. Only the oo-operivtion, simplification, standardization, and trailooducation that results from movements ol! the 
institute and convention type will ever put a stop 
to the ruthlessness of  Amoricn n practice.
Panaceas for our industrial aches and pains 
will ensue from the substitution of logic and re
search for our old trial and error systems of 
reform. The establishment of the Ahrens Chair 
ol! Plumbing as an indirect result of the first In
stitute, indicates very clearly that the current 
educational practice and scientific discipline have 
been accepted by big business.
This first sign of direct co-operation between 
industry and the schools augurs well for the ac
ceptance of the proposals outlined by the Indus
trial Conference Board after its recent investiga
tion of engineering education. The danger is 
that we will devote too much energy to this new 
activity. If we manage to avoid this danger, we 
may look for a more temperate balance between 
materialism and idealism in the future.
Of course, our convention program will be thor
oughly Menckenized and Nathanated. Someone 
will suggest that we advertise as the Community 
House of America. But, while the critics sit 
chin-in-hand pondering our fate, we may without 
compunction inscribe on our shingle: Carnegie 
A Pound of Prevention and a Ton of Cure; 
and with such institutions of note as Yale, Illi
nois, Kentucky U, and the International Corres
pondence School following the trail we have 
broken, take a few steps in what appears to be 
the general direction of progross and Ultimate 
Normalcy.
BUT HES MAKIN LOTTA DOUGH!
Are we dehumanizing our education? After a 
superficial consideration we say no. AVe now 
study economics, sociology, ami psychology, all 
that we may better interpret the human equation. 
The plea is for a broad-minded well-balanced 
man.
Yet all the propaganda for culture is accepted 
because it points out the way to social and finan
cial distinction. The humanities are studied for 
the same reasons that the sciences are on the 
curriculumin anticipation, of future gain of 
prestige. Consequently both arc presented as 
practical courses.
Advertise yourself, shouts the commercial en
gineer; keop up on the trade journals, the chem
ist admonishes; youll need this later 011, is the 
math departments caution; all are beacons to 
success. After receiving these injunctions the 
student is at once on his guard. So this is what 
studies are: work, machines that may later 
lighten the burden of earning a living, a nuisance,
If by the grace of the venerable Yale critic, Mr. 
Phelps, 1 were asked to contribute to hi fund of sug
gestions for the Ignoble Prize, I would nominate some
thing very dear to the hearts of American publishers 
and press agents, i. 0., the Bcores of over-popular epi
grams and personalities of the great and near great. 
These littlo gems of our literary enthusiasms provide 
the sole intellectual stimulus for thousands of good 
American folk who, not being suillciently interested to 
delve bonoath the veneer, accept them as the richest 
findings the field of Belles Lettres bus to ofTer.
In a nation like ours, hell bent for heaven via eco
nomic security and utilitarianism, progress in realms 
where imaginative thinking prevails is necessarily 
guided by a few self-appointed charletans, who easily 
satlato our meagor appetlt.es with theso shrewd observings of the human mind, all wrapped up 011 homeopathic 
(loses, ready for RM0 These montebanks control the 
magazines and the literary supplements of our newspa
pers, and it is seldom indeed that one may peruse a 
late publication without having to road Mr. Author of 
the Latest Dost-sellors opinion 011 Arrow collars, or 
Immortality, or without being assured by some newly 
discovorod genius that as a little lad, ofttimos ho had 
to sloop undor the puvomont, and that' ho received an 
education in spite of his four years at Yalo.
We are fast boeomlng a nation which foods wholly 011 
a pithy typo of opigrnmatlc loaven. Within the last 
few woolen 1 have discovorod several epigrams which 
will no doubt prove to bo righly stimulating to the tired 
business mail's Intellectual life, Qeorgo Arllss assorts 
his soholiiiilnosu and sincerity when ho writes that 
"The art of Hi' aotor is to loam how not to bo real 011 
the singe without being found out by the nudionco. 
The poet's raison d'etre is woll taken care of by Carl 
Sandburg, when he reasons that "Poetry Is a mystic, 
sensuous inathomatics of lire, smokestacks, wadies, 
pansies, people, and purple sunsots." And llnally, Mr. 
(Soorgo Joan Nathan defends his art by avowing that 
"all criticism is, at bottom, 1111 effort 011 the part of the 
practitioner to show off himself and his art at the 
expense of the artist and the art which he criticises.
It is because of the hold this kind of literary en
deavor bus on our life, perhups, that a modest artist 
never becomes popular In America. A case in point 
would be the art of Thomas Hardy. Hardy has never 
to my knowledge divulged his taBte in wearing apparel, 
nor has he entertained his infrequent interviewers by 
giving his opinion 011 American universities. Called 
by Sinclair Lewis and Arnold Bennent the greatest 
living novelist," he stands pre-eminently above his 
contemporaries in the Held of prose Action; yet Ameri
cans continue to deprive themselves of his art in favor 
of the Young Intellectuals, who more than amuse and 
satisfy with their cript realistic jargon.
The trend of good taste in America, then, seems to 
be away from the rich and subtle, and expresses itself 
in the mere glittering and bizarre. As long as prating 
press-agents shall be allowed to dictate what the pub
lic shall read, we shall be, intellectually, a nation of 
morons. What is needed is a selective discriminate 
sense that shall express itself in a passion for the 
inner beauty and truth of literature, and that shall send 
the messages of the publishers proteges to their well 
earned oblivion.
the curse brought by Adam upon the human race. 
The courses he pursues in school are.the evils of 
civilization and he progresses through life with 
his eyes glued upon that omega where he can 
retire. At best, work may relieve the tedium of 
long dull hours.
Spare time is much sought for and here the 
student finds time to investigate anything with 
an emotional appeal, lie may impeach women, 
religion, and athletics in his discourse; he passes 
judgment upon good and bad fiction; ho conducts 
various experiments and returns with the postu
late that the fair sex is too profound for him. All 
this is interesting because some prof forgot to 
tell him how he could commercialize such prac
tices.
But why doesnt; school work possess the same 
appeal? Why cannot a subject be presented on 
its intrinsic merits, an intensely absorbing theme 
for examination, a science or an art following 
only empirical rules and subject to all the viecissitudes of a human, rather than as a number of 
laws, three or four constants, and a great deal of 
inexplicible data? It has been done and is being, 
done. It. is only those in whose breasts the men
tion of an electron starts a wave of sympathy, 
who can lay true claim to the title of scientists.
LETTER BOX
To the Editor of the Tartan:
As it would be difficult to personally 
reach all the many people who helped 
make Pa-Ma Day so successful may I 
ask the favor of a few lines in the 
Tartun to express my appreciation of 
the courtesy and willing sacrifice 
shown by all who helped make this 
day the "best ever. I cannot men
tion names, the list would be too long, 
but I do want to say that I have never 
before worked with so many people, 
among students and faculty, where all 
so willingly and. so cheerfully put 
their shoulders to the wheel and push
ed till the work was done.
My heartfelt thanks to all for the 
happy pull-together.
A. J. WURTS, Chairman 
J/a-Ma Day Committee.
INTERCOLLEGIATE
CLIPPINGS
Because of the collapse of the 
stands during the W. and J.-Carnegie 
game, the executive committee of the 
board of trustees and the athleticcouncil of W. and J. have unanimously 
decided to close the college field to 
the public for the remainder of the 
season.
The freshmen of the Bucknells wo
mens college must place their names 
on a large placard, which will be car
ried on sticks three feet long. Last 
year, they were compelled to wear 
their names on green bibs.
Freshmen hazing has been abolished 
at Trinity College in the hope that 
they can retain more students.
Five students of the University of 
Indiana were recently suspended from 
college for operating automobiles 
(cans) without first obtaining permis
sion from the dean.
The co-eds of Bradley Polytechnic 
are holding a suppressed desire 
dance for co-eds only. Each frollcker 
will reveal her unexpressed wishes 
and dress exactly as she wishes re
gardless of fashion, laste or modesty.
At Temple University all examina
tions have been abolished because the 
psychology department there believe*, 
them to be inaccurate, antiquated and 
influenced by personalities.
At California Tech they have an an
nual Garter Day. Only five fresh
men were found to wear them. One 
man was ultra-colleglate by wearing 
only one garter.
About 300 students of Tulane Uni
versity, with their band, followed their 
team from New Orleans to Chicago on 
a special when they played North 
western. Incidentally, they won.
With a crown of red hair as the 
only prerequisite for membership and 
the only means of identification, the 
"Blazers have made their advent 
upon the Iowa Wesleyan campus.
Fifty juniors and seniors of the 
University of North Carolina were 
granted optional class attendance dur
ing the winter quarter as a reward for 
making a B average during the fall 
quarter.
A course in canoeing is being of
fered at the University of Michigan.

900,000 Chicle Dispensaries
Only 2,000 Book Stores in U. S.
The United States now yearly pro
duces more Ford cars than babies. 
The tax figures show that the Ameri
can people annually spend about 650 
million dollars for stage, motion pic
ture, and athletic entertainment. It 
is estimated that at least 50 million 
dollars is expended yearly in this 
country for chewing gum. There are 
few towns throughout the forty-eight 
states where one cannot buy motor 
cars, cosmetics, or chewing gum. 
These commodities are obviously ne
cessary to the American people.
Recently, according to Jesse Lee 
Bennett, "one of the great chewing 
gum manufacturers announced that he 
had 900,000 retail outlets for the sale 
of his products. Considering these 
figures one is startled to learn that 
there are whole great states in our 
Union where there is not one really 
big and modern book store. There 
are many states where books are sold 
only at departmental stores or at 
news stands. On the mailing list of 
the National Association of Book Pub
lishersan organization composed of 
the largest American publishers, there 
are only 2,700 names of shops. In fact, 
there are about 2,000 real bookstores 
in this country of nearly 110,000,000 
people. Obviously books are com
modities that are not yet vitally neces
sary to the life of the American peo
ple.
Statistics for publications show an 
average of more than three magazines 
per month. Other figures show a 
most delightful balanceone daily 
newspaper, two weeklies, three month
ly magazines and, an extreme esti
mate, four books per year, is the aver
age of the American household. This 
is standardization of the most interesting type. Motor cars at an average 
cost of 400 dollars and books at an 
average of one dollar is a great dif
ference. Yet each year America 
spends forty times as much for mo
tor cars as for books.
Book production is neatly chroni
cled in the following table:
Fiction ..............................30,014,000 vol.
Poetry and Drama........... 2,985,000 vol.
History ............................ 6,457,000 vol.
Religion and Theology..48,19.4,000 vol.
Education (textbooks,
etc.) ...........................96,480,000 vol.
Law .................................. 3,663,000 vol.
Juvenile ...........................49,680,000 vol.
All others ........................60,002,000 vol.
These figures show the apportion 
ment of the various types of books. 
One readily notes that textbooks 
leads the list, and it is not hard to 
guess the reason.'
Pondering these estimates and 
statistics one is brought to the reali
zation that perhaps the vaudeville 
story about the man who replied to 
the suggestion that he take a book ; 
a present to his wife; Oh, she has 
book, belongs to the realm of actual 
fact and not to the realm of fancy.1
"Considering the fact that there are 
probablly 500,000,000 Illiterate adults 
in this country, and that most of the 
books sold are sold to less than 500,- 
000 households. It is likely that the 
average American household certainly 
does not as yet purchase four books 
per year.
But a flood tide is coming.
One evidence of the striking new 
development is the enormous sale of 
very cheap, paper bound, pocket : 
books by mail order. One of the most 
successful of the publishers of the 
small book3 claims that he has sold 
over 100,000,000 copies during the past 
five years. It is to be noted that most 
of these books have been of unusual 
high quality from a literary stand
point, being reprints of standard and 
classic books.
Do other countries buy greater re
lative quantities of books than us? 
Denmark may be taken for the pur
poses of comparison. It is a small and 
not very wealthy nation, has a popula
tion of 3,500,000 and is about the size 
of the state of New York. There are 
in Denmark about 1,200 shops selling 
books exclusively. New York City 
with a population of approximately
7.000.000 has less than 300 shops 
where books are sold, and a great 
many of these shops handle only as a 
sideline. It is to be seriously ques 
tioned whether in all the United 
States there are many more than 1,200 
shops selling books exclusively. 
Whether these figures could- be made 
to prove that Denmark is nearly thirty 
times as civilized as the United States 
of America is a debatable question.1
"It was the belief of the founders of 
this country that universal education 
was absolutely necessary to the suc
cess of the Democratic experiment the 
country was making. The foundere 
appear to have assumed that only 
the perfecting of mechanical devices 
making books cheap was necessary 
to have the people read very widely. 
How would these old founders and 
their ablest contemporaries explain 
the strange phenomenon that, when 
the country they have founded had
110.000.000 people and reached from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific; when 
had more than half of the gold in the 
world and such per capita wealth and 
standard of living as was never before 
known among mankind, only about 
one book per capita per year would be 
produced or brought by their des
cendants.
