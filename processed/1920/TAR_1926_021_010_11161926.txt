naturally, for CRH is not a sta

Any time youre/listening to, 
your radio, however, you may be

That story-goes back to under

Hanna, as a student, developed 
an intense, interest in radio; and, 
making capital out of his hobby, 
his thesis was entitled, Inter

To carry on his experiments, 
it was logical that Hanna should 
find his way into the, Westing-,

UnitedEstimates . from ' the States Treasury Indicate next'Jane there will be ' a plus of about $250,000,000 suit of federal tes.-,receipts this year. This 8urplus:ar1eesUi spite of the fact that there was. conuld erable cut In federal taxes In. tb' current year. It - may be recalled that the Admlnlstratloi what disturbed becaui large cuts vfhlch, v/era made by Congreds and that a deficit was feared.
Because of the.fact that th< Secretary of the -Treasury has taken unfailingly a' pessimistic view es to the receipts, with the 'result, that the Federal Government each .year shows a large Burplus, many people have been led. to. the conclu- Blon that the. Treasury DeparUDent
- . giveas to why. the amount.of the Go eramenVa " income from taxes should be underestimated. In the first place It Is Imposlble to estimate accurately la advance the degree of prosperity which the tlon Is. to eojoy in any -cu.fi year, and we-have been-very fortunate-in experlenclni of years of -unusual - prosperity 'which, have swelled the Goi ment's . Income from both direct and indirect taxes.A farther reason Is that there ai ' always some members of Congre who wish to go much farther than .the Administration In regard 1 the cutttng-.pt taxes and the "li ' creasing df expenditures. As a r 
eult.lt,Is always safer for the eBl mated receipts to be lesB than tfc expected receipts In ord Administration should so! seir In the hole at the . end of ttii year. If the Secretary of th< Treasury bad estimated the federal Income to be larger than wa actually the case.(he Administration would at the present time face an embarrassing situation.At the present'time there, aro various suggestions being presented as to what should be done with this surplus The . President fav- "ored a rebate to the tax payers of aboQt 12.per cent of .the amount that they had.paid this^year. Secretary Mellon was opposed to this plan andfavcred an allowance to be. grantedIot de&uclicn from the payments to be madedurlxig .the coming year. On the otherhand the Democrats .are. planntag ti> Introduce .a tax reduction-bill to lighten taxes.
