NITE ARTS TO GIVE DANCE
Tech opened its home basketball 
season last Thursday night at Motor 
Square Garden with a defeat from 
Yale, 40-25. Although outplayed in 
the first half, the team came back 
in the seceond and played on a par 
with their more seasoned rivals. Bui 
Yales lead was to great and despite 
their great comeback, the Plaid was 
awarded the short end of the score.
The crowd at the game was small, 
due probably to the Christmas recess 
but more Tech students, who live 
in Pittsburgh, should have been 
there. Unless the team receive better 
support, they cannot expect to come 
off victorious.
The Bull Dog has a seven man 
team, Bailey and Shelton alternating 
at forward, and Ohley and Conklin 
taking turns at center. Their team
work, earley in the season was 
exceptionally good, and their system 
of passing could hardly be improved 
upon. They would work the ball 
down the floor, time and again, and 
it would be necessary only for a 
short side shot for a goal.
The Tartans could not get started 
in the first half, their teamwork 
and passing being away below stand
ard. They found themselves in the 
second period tho, and came back 
with a punch running up 15 points 
in a few minutes.
Yale started off with a rush and 
were never headed. They scored 17 
points while Tech was securing 3 
and the half ended 22-6. In this 
period the Plaid caged only one 
field goal, due to a long shot from 
mid-floor by "Windy Lynn. The 
other four points came from fouls. 
Tech came back strong in the sec
ond half and forct:d the Blue -to 
extend itself to keep the game from 
being tied up. Gibson, scored three 
field goals and the rest of the team 
took heart at this and made the 
game interesting. But Yale staged 
a rally and run their total up to 
40. In reality Yale lost this half, 19- 
-18, but Techs handicap was too 
much to overcome and Yale emerg
ed the victor. Honors in foul shoot
ing'lay with Lynn who in the sec
ond half, shot 7 out of 8. The
floor work of Lynn and Nichols help
ed Tech in the second half while 
the .shooting of Bailey and Alderman 
featured for Yale.

On Saturday, January 8, 1921, the 
Night School students of the Divi
sion of Arts will give a Bohemian 
acquaintance dance for the Day stu
dents and faculty in the same div
ision.
There will be special stunts and 
extra good music which will add to 
the enjoyment of the evening.
A registration card will be re
quired for admission of the Day stu
dents and a receipt of dues will be 
required by the Night students.
It is hoped there will be a large 
attendance, as this dance will be the 
immediate forerunner of the Ball, 
and allow Night and Day students 
to become better acffuainted.
The Night School students were 
very much in evidence at the Mys
terious Dance and wish to say to 
the P. and D. Department that it 
was a very successful affair and 
wish to congratulate the committee 
upon their work.
The Night School Senate was elec

FORUM DEBATES IAN. 11
Margaret Morrison .Girls on Pro
gram. Last Debate Success.
The next debate of the Carnegie 
Forum will be held Tuesday eve
ning, January n, in the Arts build 
ing. The proposition: Resolved that 
& gpod athlete has a greater 3d 
yertising value for Tech than f 
good scholar." The w*U be two 
teams of three people each. Special 
attention is called to the fact that 
thpre is to be a girl on each side 
from M. M. D. This is a live ques-? 
tion and should created much in
terest,
The first regular debate: Re
solved that a M, M. D. girl would be 
a better wife for a Tech man than 
an Arts girls was held before the 
holidays. The arguments were well 
presented and it was shown that 
Tech girls have some good matri
monial qualities. As was expected 
the debate was full of humor and 
everyone present was well enter' 
tained. Owing to the fact that this 
was the debute of the Forum. the 
committee decided not to have a 
decision rendered.
Tech architects again won honor* 
at the last judgement of the Beaur 
Arts Society held in New York, Dec., 
15. The sophomores made a killing 
receiving seven first mentions plac
ed (2 values) six first mentions (il/< 
values) remainder mentions (1 val
ue-). The problem was a side en
trance to a church.
The junior problem, A Small 
Chapel was awarded 3 first men
tions. This was a more difficult 
plan solution and consequently few
er high awards were given. How
ever the juniors did very well. 
Messers Di Nardo, Elligton, Raisford 
and Hitchens criticised the problems.
The senior 'class A" problem A 
Staircase in a City Hall was com
pleted by fifteen men and will be 
judged January 14. The solutions 
submitted were as usual very well 
presented, and undoubtedly we. will 
again knock em cold.

On behalf of the Athletic Council 
of Carm.vo Tech. ! wi.h y.m all * 
Happy ~.nl Prosperous New Year. 1 
am taking this opportunity of thank
ing the Administration: Alumni and 
Students for their cooperation and 
support given to us during Iht past 
year, in our endeavor to lift Ath
letics to a higher plane, so that we 
can take our place in tho Athletic 
World with the rest ot the Colleges 
and Universities.
This has been an uphill task from 
the start, mainly due to the lack 
of proper finances and lack of co
operation by a large majority of 
of our Alumni. At the present lime, 
there are more high class a 'deles 
attending school than ever before in 
the history of Tech, and ali they 
need is the proper backing and they 
will speak for themselves. Review
ing the last year, 1920, which was 
only our start, we have made the 
following record:
Games Games 
Won Lost Tied 
Track Events 600
Tennis Matches 12 r 1
Baseball 961
Football 5 3 o
The above record we can be proud 
of, as it is the greatest Tech has 
ever had in one year, closing with 
or grand and glorious victory over 
W & J in football. Our prospects 
for the new year are even brighter 
than the past, for the reason thac 
over 95% of our men are back for 
the coming year and having had the 
experience of playing one or more 
years, they will be a great deal 
more valuable this coming year.
Going over the pei'sonnel of our 
Coaches in the various branches of 
sport, you will find that they arc: 
the best in the country.
The Administration is giving up 
proper support; the Students are doinpr more than, their part, both fi
nancially and also lending mor/li 
support in every way, but, all the 
above will count for nothing un
less we can get- the financial support 
of the Alumni. This has been the 
one 'weak link in our chain, so far 
and this should be tho strongest, 
because of the great number. To 
date, there, are about i8;ooo gradu
ates and former students who have 
attended school. Last spring, when 
we made an appeal from this vast 
group of men and women, we re
ceived replies and contributions 
from the small number of 125. Pause 
for a moment and think this oVor. 
Arent you ashamed? Now let us all 
wake up and rally round our great 
Athletic Drive, at which time you 
will be asked to contribute the small 
sum of $10.00 per year, for five years. 
In return for this small sum, we 
are going to issue to all who sub
scribe, an annual pass to all home 
games. Our big drive will take place 
during the month of February, 3921. 
We are going to ask you all to see 
another Tech man and talk this up 
so that we can put it over the top.

INTER-FRATERNITY DANCE
One of the near events of the 
social calendar is an informal dance 
to be given by the Inter-Fraternity 
Council on Friday, Jan. 7th, 1921, in 
the Schenley Hotel Ball Room. Plans 
have been made by the members of 
the committee, which consists of one 
representative from the various fra
ternities represented on the InterFraternity Council, and a number of 
innovations can be expected by 
those who attend.
A cordial invitation is extended 
to all national fraternity men not 
having chapters at Tech.
PFOUTS TALKS AT CHARLEROI
Mr. William Pfouts, the well 
known, as well as eloquent foremati, 
of the Tech Pattern Shop has been 
requested to lecture to the Appren 
tice School of the Macbeth-Evans 
Glass Co. of Charleroi, Pa. It pannot be said that this is a surprise, 
as Mr. Pfouts is a recognized leader 
in the art of pattern making.
The Macbeth Evans Glass Co. in
tend to install a new foundry fo: 
their work. Lieut. Solan, who had 
charge of the research lab. at Tech 
during the war, is the chief engi
neer.
The dope is out, the information 
regarding what is undoubtedly the 
biggest social event at Tech. The 
Arts Annual Costume Ball will be 
held on Friday evening, January 21, 
1921. The question of type or style 
has been much discussed by faculty 
and students. It is a very difficult 
problem and requires much study 
and consideration: because it is the 
object of this year to do something 
that will be of greater educational 
value; that is something based on 
literature as well as art.
The title is "The Land of En
chantments and will undoubtedly 
be all the name implies. Costumes 
will be grotesque or imaginary from 
the land of make believe. They must 
represent mythological, illusionary 
or spiritual character; excluding the 
ordinary conceptions of fairies and 
witches. They should be from the 
the myth, ledgends and folklove of 
Northern and Western Europe, which 
are the Scandinavian, Celtic, Anglo 
Saxon or Teutonic sagas and tales. 
Last year in The Frolic of the 
Vanities the decorations were the 
most elaborate yet attempted. This 
year the most emphasis will be laid 
on the costumes. It will consequent
ly require diligence and study from 
every student. Many people have 
made their, costumes during the hol
idays and have had the time to do 
something which will be attractive.
On account of the limited time 
for preparation and the vast amount 
of work to be done, Arts will be a 
a busy place the next three weeks. 
The material for the decorations has 
been ordered and as soon as reglsteration is over the work of trans
forming the foyer into a realm of 
enchantment will be in full swing. 
Tho committee hopes to make this 
the best yet,, so novel, so well done 
that it will bo a credit to Tech 
.and. an outstanding oevnt. of its 
kind.

At the time when the minds of 
the day students were slowly re
covering from tljc effects of final 
exams and the question most im
portant to them was Will you be 
in tonight? This is my first evening 
home, you know, the Night stu
dents of the Division of Science and 
Engineering, that is, those who had 
three bucks to spare, assembled at 
the Hotel Chatham for their annual 
smoker and banquet. December .8 
was the date, and from the time the 
doors of the main dining room ot' 
the Chatham were thrown open to 
them until "Dear Old Tech brought 
the jollification to a fitting close 
at midnight not a dtdl or uninter
esting moment could have been 
found, not even with tho aid oi 
Professor Trinks' smoked glasses, 
which suffered severe strains as the 
evening grew in length and the en
tertainment waxed enthusiastic. 
There was plenty to eat, lots of good 
smokes, speeches that wero interest
ing, and entertainment that pleased. 
What more can bo asked of a'mere 
banquet?
After everyone had eaton his (ill 
of tho viands placed before him, 
President Groonwald called tho men' 
to order and introduced tho speak
ers of tho evening. Tho talks given 
to the men by Director Mott, Pro
fessor Howor, Doctor Ihrig, and Pro
fessor Trinks wero thoroughly on, 
joyed by all, and just ask anyone 
who was there what he thought of 
the way tho intermission between 
speeches was utilizod. Can she dance?
Director Mott brought homo to 
Liu; men tho crisis, that now pre
vails in tho teaching profession due 
to inadequate salaries and Inability 
to obtain money to employ addition
al instructors. Many of the leading 
technical schools and colleges have 
been forced because of this condi
tion to employ a large number of 
Seniors to insruct the Sophomores 
and Juniors, with a consequent de
crease in efficiency. While this sys
tem has not become necessary to 
any great extent at Tech as yet, as 
it has at Boston Tech, llinois, and 
Michigan, still, if more money is 
not forthcoming for adequate salary 
increases, it will have to be largely 
installed here also, he stated. Altlio 
a quarter million dollars was appro
priated by the trustees last year to 
wipe out the deficit remaining from 
the period of the war, and the same 
amount was appropriated this year 
for some salary increases, another 
quarter million is needed to make 
salary increases adequate, to put the 
campus in shape again, and to re
place out-worn equipment.
Dr. Ihrig and Professor Hower 
each talked entertainingly, Profes
sor Hower especially touching on the 
advantage the Night student posses
ses over the going to school at day, 
in that he can apply directly, daily, 
the knowledge and training impart
ed to him at night, while usually 
this is not possible with the day 
student.
Professor Trinks explained thj 
change in the Night School, and tli 
reason for making this change. For 
years the faculty had not been sat 
isfied with the work of the Night 
men, as practically all they could 
do was hit the "high spots, due to 
the limited amount of time avail 
able. To better this condition, the 
five year course was changed tr 
six,year course, which gives a broad
er engineering training, and at the 
same time the classes were rear
ranged in such a manner that one 
subject is given one evening of the 
week, another subject another eve
ning, and so on, instead of forcing 
the men to report for the same sub
ject several evenings a week. This 
makes it possible for tho men 
take as little or as much work 
they feel able to carry. Professor

Tech went down to defeat before 
Yale, 5-0, in the opening game of 
the hockey series, New Years eve, 
at Duquesne Garden. While Tech 
was outplayed they were not outgamed and it was only their great 
spirit that prevented the defeat 
from being more decisive. Due to 
their great defense Tech held Yale 
to a single goal in the opening per
iod and the second was almost over 
before Yale scored 2 more. Two 
more goals were added in tho final 
period, making Yale's total five.
Considering the way the playor.-. 
took chances, it was marvelous that 
there were 1T0 accidents. At one 
point, Red Godden, seeing a blueclad player sift through tho Tech 
team, made a divo at tho opponent. 
It was a pretty exhibition of clip
ping. The Yale player was thrown 
into the side boards and Red in
curred a two minutes rest. The chief 
cause of Techs downfall was their 
lack of an offense. The play for most 
of the gamo was in front of Techs 
cage.
Yalos first score camo after ton 
minutes play in tho first period, 
when Van Ingem made a shot from 
the side. After 12 minutes of play 
in tho second period, Fostce shot a 
goal from scrimmage. Bulkloy scor
ed again a minute later. Carson 
scored the fourth goal after i min
ute play in the 3rd period. Five 
minutes later Bui key shot tho last 
goal.
Carson and Shiras, Pittsburgh boys 
playing for Old ICli, had plenty of 
rooters in tho crowd and I hey gave 
a fine exhibition of playing.

Yalo made a clean sweep of tho 
hockey series by taking over Tech 
al Duquesno Garden, Now Year,9 
Night, 6-0. Despite the onesided 
score the game was interesting and 
enjoyed by the large crowd. Only 
the stubborn resistance offered by 
Tech prevented the score from be
ing greater. Red Godden used his 
football experience to a good advan
tage in stopping the Yale players 
when they threatened the Tech goal. 
The score would have been much 
closer had Techs defense been on a 
par with their defense. Their team 
work was lacking when they would 
get the puck near tho Yale cacro 
and as a result their attack was 
easily broken up.
Yale started their attack early in 
the first period and the firrft goai 
was scored by Foster in less than 
two minutes play. Carson secured 
the second goal eight minutes later. 
In the second period Foster scored 
after one minute of play. Two min
utes later Shiras placed the puck 
in the net from scrimmage. Carson 
scored after five minutes of play 
in the final period, skating the 
length of the ice and then shooting 
the goal. Van Ingem scoed the final 
point as the whistle sounded, ending 
the game.

of the whole school in order to be
come a full fledged member of the

BUFFALO CLUB ACTIVt'l LIES
TI10 past spirited meetings of Buf
falo men at Tech have completely 
organized them into the Buffalo 
Club. At a recent mooting the fol
lowing men were elected as officers' 
President, Albert, A. MeinhoUl; Vico 
I'resident, Vernon C. Olsen; Score( 
tary and Treasurer, Herbert G. Ko.it,
Not least of tin* many purposes 
of the club is that of boosting Tech 
in Buffalo in order to draw men Ivrti 
who will hi; a real asset to tl.< p<Oj 
motion and maintenance of Tocli 
spirit. With this in view, the mem
bers of the Club are working hfird 
on plans for stunts which will be 
staged at the Bison College ( lnl) 
get-together to be hold in 1 in;l;iI*> 
during the Christmas recess. The! 
stunts will be of an advertising na
ture for Carnegie Tech for they will 
comprise various humorous phases 
of college life on and about Techs 
campus. Rehearsals have been fre
quent and they bid fair to create 
a humorous, lively sketch which will 
compete for first place among those 
to be staged by other colleges at 
the Bison College Club gathering.
As a further boost for Tech, mem
bers of the club will take it upon 
themselves to address the high 
school from which they graduated. 
Their talks will be about Tech in 
general and the advantages it of
fers for higher technical learning.
The Club has several social events 
planned for after the Christmas va
cation. A theatre party will no 
doubt be the first of these.
So far there has been an average 
attendance of twenty men at each 
meeting. Where are the rest of you 
Buffalo men? Wake up, attend the 
meetings and help boost Tech in 
Buffalo as well as derive numerous 
benefits for yourself. Show up for 
the Bison College Club get-together, 
let Buffalo know you are from Tech 
and what a great Alma Mater it is.

THE HIPPOLYTUS OF EURIPIDES
The Hippolytus of Euripides pro
duced by Professor Stevens in the 
Little Theatre, is in some respects 
the clirnax of the work of the School 
of Drama during the Fall Quarter. 
The production is an admirable one, 
but, were it less satisfactory, we 
should be thankful for the courage 
and the vision which bring us this 
difficult and absorbing play. There 
is little doubt that the Hippolytus 
: is a far greater play than we have 
seen at Tech this season, or than we 
are likely to see this winter in, a 
commercial theatre in Pittsburgh. 
One is moved to astoishment at the 
power, the beauty, above all, at 
the essential modernity of this tra
gedy in a inode and from a civiliza
tion of which most of us know no
thing. Matter for thought is it that 
an every-day audicnce in the 20th 
century feels the pity and terror in 
a masterpiece from the fifth century 
B. C. Turning away from it, we find 
no ready reason for gratulatioii' as 
we look about us at our venal stage. 
From the Aphrodite of Euripides to 
the Aphrodite of Morris Gest; if 
this be progress, make the most of 
it!
Interesting, too, it is to contrast 
the workmanship of this old Greek 
with the hallowed master in the 
English tongue, William Shakespere. 
We find a renewed appeal in the 
austerites and the restraint of the 
three unities, and a fresh distaste 
for the sloppy, sprawling technique 
of the esteemed William.
This supreme play calls for the 
most intelligent acting that our stu
dents can give. That this production 
is so gripping is due to Professor 
Stevens unusual and conspicuous 
powers as a producer, and to the 
talents which his principals offer 
for his use. Of the chief characters, 
Miss Lotz, as Phaedra, is the most 
distinctfully successful, in a role de
manding maturity of imagination 
and the capacity for sustaining emo
tion and interest thru a long and 
exhausting scene. Her tear-stained 
voice, she is tempted to over-use, but 
her aspect and speech are poignant
ly those of a woman stricken. Miss 
Thompson, tho she hardly looks the 
Nurse of our imagination, has a fine 
presence, eloquent gesture, an un
usually clear diction, and consider
able finesse in expression. To the 
title role, Mr. Willard is perhaps 
rather better suited than Mr. Beyer, 
tho each interpretation is interest
ing and effective. Mr. Willard seems 
the more manly, Mr. Beyer the boy
ish; the former gives us the hard
ness of the somewhat priggish youth, 
tho latter, the tender helplessness 
of his death. Mr. Lubin looks well
as Theseus, and, in escaping tho
somewhat grotesque gesticulation of 
his earlier scenes, achieves dignity 
at the end. Mr. Lees gives a bril
liant delivery of the Henchman's 
declaration, tho as usual he seems 
to forgot that ho is in a play and
not alono on a platform. Mr. Colpitts, in the same part, keeps in tho 
picture and shows marked improve
ment over his earlier work. One can 
not leave unmontionod Miss Morri
sons exquisite characterization of 
tho doa ex machina, Miss Dalzclls 
startling pantomino as the blind wo
man, Miss Harmon's grace and rich
ness of voice, and Mr. Speers warm 
tone and feeling for rhythm.
The production, of course, is not 
impeccable. The monotonous chant 
which the chorus uses is effective, 
but it should not interfere, as it of
ten does, with ones hearing the 
lines. Besides, the habit of chanting 
is contagious, and some of the prin
cipals threatend to turn the play 
into a rather funeral grand opera. 
The stage is unnecessarily cluttered 
toward the end of the play with 
speechless supes. One wishes that 
the cast would decide how to pro
nounce Theseus; the least attactive 
variant is Thesoous.
Fault finding aside, we cannot be 
too grateful for this rare dramatic 
experience.
Women
A woman is queer, theres no doubt 
about that,
She hates to be thin, and she hates 
to be fat
One minute its laughter, the next its 
a cry
You cant understand her, however 
you try.
But theres one thing about her which 
everyone knows
A womans not dressed till she pow
ders her nose.

"LIFT UP THE STANDARD
Tho following editorial which appeared in a recent issue of the Schen
ley Triangle, a paper published by tho students of Schenley High School, 
was brought to our attention tho other day. It seems well worth consid
eration and comment, not only because of the fact that it is an 
exceptionally discerning picco of writing for a high school student, 
but it explains one of the reasons why some of our freshmen have such a 
difficult time in carrying tho work of tho first year.
"In the matter ol' scholarship standards, colleges and high schools are 
drifting in opposite directions. In colleges, owing to the large number ol 
applicants for admission, standards have boon raised, but in secondary 
schools we find tho earnest application of students to their work is woe
fully decreasing. A date with Jane or a good show in town has come 
to answer 'I don't know' to a teacher's question with an inflection 
implying T dont care. We are too ready to try to bluff a teacher and, 
indeed, wo have come to think nothing of borrowing another person's 
written work.
What does this mean? It means that when wo come to enter college 
we shall be confronted by tho fact that wo cannot attain their require
ments or if we do manago to enter college, wo shall find ourselves 
untrained in concentration or accurate*habits of thought. If wo go straight 
from high school in our vocation, we shall, under the present tendency 
in high school scholarship, bo untrained not only in the acquirement of 
knowledge necessary for our .work but in habits of strict application to 
business.
We cannot pass this by without tho remark that there are a great 
many upperclassmen who might well re-read the last sentence ol this 
article, substituting the word college for high school, thereby finding 
some timely food for thought. Tho habits of lack ol concentration and 
the tendency to bluff things through are not, unfortunately, continded 
only to high schools.
A YEAR IN TIIE DORJVIS
Stephen Leacock is recognized as a keen, satirical humorist. He has 
boon called tho Canadian Mark Twain, which is, I sometimes think a 
compliment to Mr. Clemens, and yet ho is also what wo might call a high
brow, a col logo professor, and all that. In an article published by him not 
long ago, ho outlined his plan of establishing a university. We can t 
quite docido whether it was serious or not, as so much of his comedy has 
real common-sonso underlying it that you find yourself seriously con
sidering tho plausibility of ideas you have just boon laughing at. For 
one thing, ho says that one of the first things ho would soo to in his 
university is a Dormitory. This would come second only, we beloive, to 
tho smoking room, where the students could congregate to talk. His idea 
seem pretty good to us.
It. has often been remarked that the spirit of some, particular college 
is duo to its location, or to tho class of men from whom its personnel is 
drawn, but wo ljoloivo that the manner in which and the extent to which 
the students associate with one another has more to do with the spirit 
of a school than any other influence.
In tho Dormitories of any college, youve got to get acquainted. We 
don't care how exclusive you may feel, by the time you have lived in a 
Dormitory for a quarter you are at least acquainted with the men on 
your floor, and you must associate to some extent with tho men whose 
interests and ideals differ greatly from your own. Tho result is not only 
a broadening influence in your own life, but an appreciation of and re
spect for the viewpoint of the'other fellow, together with the formation 
of a bond of sympathy between you. It is of just such stuff as this that 
college spirit is formed.
It has boon suggested several times that first year students should 
bo obliged to live in the Dormitories, or sometimes that ouch student 
should live at least one year in the Dormitories, with no specification 
as to tho particular year to be chosen. Wo think that tho suggestion has 
many points in its favor. It is reasonable to suppose opposite conditions 
would bring about opposite effects. It so, a remark made to us the other 
day regarding the lack of spirit in one of our neighbors may"be quoted 
as an argument in favor of the plan suggested. We were speaking to a 
student of the school in question, and in reply to a quiery as to his the
ory explaining the situation there he said, "Well, we don't hardly know 
each other. You see, we have no Dormitories. If that is the true reason, 
we think our plan well worth while.

"Dress Right" is the latdst slogan. 
The proper wearing apparel for ev
ery occasion, the right colors to com
bine with each other and the per
sonal peculiarities of the individual 
student, and the advancing spring 
staples are to be the subjects of the 
big "How to Dress exhibit to be 
staged on the campus soon by the 
classes in advertising, in co-opera
tion with the J. W. Robinson Com
pany, the art classes of the univer
sity, the Trojan, and the students 
generally.
The demonstration will be varied 
and as realistic at the nature of tlu* 
show will permit. Besides portrayiny 
the proper garment; the right colors 
and the appropriate styles, there will 
bo horrible examples of the wrong 
thing, as it is done in institutions of 
higher learning as well as elsewhere.
Models will probably be chosen at 
random by a committee from the advertising classes, and will consist of 
both men and women. Good-looking 
girls and men who "look like some
body will be especially in demand.

What Is Vacuum?
IF THE traffic policeman did not hold up his hand and control the 
automobiles and wagons and people there would be collisions, 
confusion, and but little progress in any direction. His business 
is to direct.
The physicist who tries to obtain a vacuum that is nearly perfect 
has a problem somewhat like that of the traffic policcman. Air is 
compor.cd of molcculesbillions and billions of them flying about 
in all directions and often colliding. The physicists pump is designed 
to make the molecules travel in one direction  out through the 
exhaust. The molecules are much too small to be seen even with a 
microscope, but the pump jogs them along and at least starts them in 
the right direction.
A perfect vacuum would be one in which there is not a single free 
molecule.
For over forty years scientists have been trying to pump and jog 
and herd more molecules out of vessels. There are still in the best 
vacuum obtainable more molecules per cubic centimeter than there 
are people in the world, in other words, about two billion. Whenever 
a new jogging device is invented, it becomes possible to eject a few 
million more molecules.
The Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company have 
spent years in trying to drive more and more molecules of air from 
containers. The chief purpose has been to study the effects obtained, 
as, for example, the boiling av/ay of metals in a vacuum.
This investigation of high vacua had unexpected results. It 
became possible to make better X - ray tubes  better because the 
X - rays could be controlled; to make the electron tubes now so essen
tial in long-range wireless communication more efficient and trust
worthy; and to develop an entirely new type of incandescent lamp, 
one which is filled with a gas and which gives more light than any of 
the older lamps.
No one can foretell what will be the outcome of research in pure 
science. New knowledge, new ideas inevitably are gained. And 
sooner or later this new knowledge, these new ideas find a practical 
application. For this reason the primary purpose of the Research 
Laboratories of the General Electric Company i3 the broadening of 
human knowledge.

With the approach of winter and 
the consequent annual unpopularity 
of the parks, the Anvil is again un
veiled for the uso of those who loel 
the depression of Romance while 
the park-bench to davenport move
ment is in full cry. Or to uso the 
O, 1). jargon while the seat of tin' 
engagement is being shifted. To 
those of the students who were here 
last year and showed their school 
spirit and self sacrifice by reading 
the Tartan wo trust our appearance 
comes as a pleasant surprise, some
thing like hearing that your Math 
Prof. has suddenly come down with 
the flu. To the others we know the 
surprise is complete. A close study 
of the late Tech-catalogue fails to 
reveal any mention of the Anvil 
listed as one of the schools advan
tages. In this we are not alone. Our 
most popular attraction has also 
slighted. The most careful study of 
the above literary gem fails to dis
close any half-tone of that educat
ing institution, the cut. in full op
eration on a windy day. In fact 
that indispensable aid commonly 
known as the slip-stick (the "s is 
silent in Maggie Murphy and De
sign) is also ignored. It would ap
pear from where we sit that the 
compiler of that piece of rare fic
tion the catalogue, has over-looked 
some of his best bets. Or is he mere
ly holding them in reserve for a 
grand show down?
