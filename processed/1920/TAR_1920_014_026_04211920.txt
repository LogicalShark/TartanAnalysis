Keen Rivalry Expected in the Derby Race Campus Week.
Many Other Features.
The greatest, wildest, jazziest, most 
blood-curdling, hair-raising, breathstopping, shirt-tearing event in Tech 
annals. The Ben Hur of the 20th 
Century. See the fifteen fire-eating, 
smoking, snorting, rustling, hustling 
gas chariots piloted with their deathdefying pilots tag with the'under
taker. Watch the canny jockeying for 
positions, see them rocket thru the

terrible grind down the final lap, men 
and machines crumbling under the 
terrific strain.
Yes, we pause to palpitate, its going 
to be some race and the prize, the

addition another prize will be given 
for the best designed entrant.
This novel motor classic is to be 
the headliner of the varied offerings 
to be featured during campus week 
and is scheduled for Friday morning 
according to the latest word from the 
circus headquarters.
Each fraternity is to enter a car 
of their own design, manned by a

FIRST M. M. 0. HOME 
CONCERT BIG SUCCESS
Were you at the Girls Home Con
cert last Friday night and Saturday 
morning? If you werenuf ced! But 
for the benefit of those who were not, 
well say this much: It was a regular 
up-to-standard Margaret Morrison 
event. Of course it had to rain, but 
every cloud has a silver lining, you 
know, and lots of the dorm girls got 
taxi rides that they wouldnt other 
wise .haver had. Promptly at eightthirty the curtain of the Little Thea
tre rose and the show began. The per 
formers made a brilliant spectacle in 
their evening dresses, which were 
quite a contract to the black and 
white of the mens concert.
Both the Glee Club and the String 
ers/ showed evidences of long and 
steady training,, and their ability is 
deserving of great praise. The varia
tion of the program was such as to 
suit everyones taste; it contained ev
erything from a number by Rochamonaanoff down to Nobody Knows, 
and to tell the truth (this in a whis
per), the latter took a lot better. 
There were several special numbers, 
including a reading by Miss Harmon 
of Design School and a Chinese 
Dance by Misses Reed and Zarbosky 
of Margaret Morrison. Several minor 
accidents occurred during the course 
of the evening whic hafforded wide 
amusement to the girls on the plat
form, and much entertainment for the 
audience.
The concert lasted about an hour 
and a half,, when the audience ad 
journed to the foyer, where novel 
dance programs of white leather were 
distributed. Maggios orchestra fur
nished music for the evening, and it 
was pronounced the best ever. We 
even have a suspicion that the rumor 
about certain faculty members in 
dulHng in that naughty shimmie 
might be true, for certainly no one 
could resist the strains Oh and 
Venetian Moon. The dance broke 
up at two a. m., much to everyone1 
disappointment.
Among those of the faculty who 
attended the concert were Director 
Breed, Director Bossange, Dean Tarbell, Miss Parry, Mrs. Vernorken, Mr. 
Bright, Mr. Obrien, Miss Holmes, Mr. 
Hamer, Miss Winchester, Miss Leon
ard, Miss Hills, Dr. Lang, Miss Colernman, Miss Patton, Miss Spurier, Mr. 
Millet, and Miss Weber.
The only regret we have is that 
more did not come out for this big
gest event of the M. M. year. How
ever, it is said that the first year is 
always the hardest, and much suc
cess is in sight for this new organi
zation.
PLEBE TWILIGHT PARTY
The two Plebe classes of Margaret 
Morrison and Science held a twilight 
party last Tuesday.
The great event started at 5:30 in 
the Union, all the Plebes wrere intro
duced in rapid fire order and the or
chestra gave some real jazzy selec
tions. After the music short speeches 
of welcome were given by Miss Cole
man, M. M. C. S. Plebe president, and 
Mr. Craighead, Plebe Science, follow
ed by a short address by Dean Mott 
in which he congratulated the Plebes 
on their pep and initiative.
presumably from the rear. The length 
of the course has not yet been deter
mined but the rules allow that the 
crew may interchange positions at any 
point.
Many supporting features are being 
planned including a greased pig chase, 
in which the pig wlil be given to the 
captor, a handicap race and many 
other novel departures.
The rules governing the race are as 
follows:
(1) All cars must be equipt with 
four wheels.
(2) The crew of each car will con
sist of two mena driver and a push
er. These men may change places at 
any time.
(3) The minimum weight of each 
car is 75 lbs.
(4) The rear wheels of each car 
must be interchangeable. During the 
race each car will be required to run 
into the pit and change the left rear 
wheel to the right, and the right rear 
wheel to the left.
(5) Only one man of the crew of 
each car may have his feet on the

BY RABBI G0LDENS1
At the Student Vespers last week 
Rabbi Samuel II. Goldenson of Rodef 
Shalem Temple spoke on the The 
Jewish Contribution to the' Solution 
of the Present Social Crisis. He 
pointed out that the Old Testament 
held the solution of many of todays 
problems in the books of Law, Psalms, 
the boks of Wisdom and the Proph
ets.
This week the speaker will be Rev. 
George Caleb Moor, D.D., of Madison 
Ave Baptist Church, New York. The 
Madison Ave. Church is one of the 
most famous churches in the country 
and Dr. Moor is a wonderful speaker. 
His subject will be The Celestial 
Quadrangle. Every one is invited 
to attend.

SOPH CHEMICALSPRACTICE 
PRINCIPLES OF CHEMISTRY
The Soph Chemicals decided to be
come active, due to the fact, that they 
think that the Plebes are getting away 
with everything. Following the rules 
of qualitative chemistry, they began 
to analyze the Plebes footwear and 
headgear more closely, thus resulting 
in the precipitation of a number of 
names. However they claim that the 
resulting product of that precipitation 
will be the production of static-electricity due to the friction that will 
be produced by rubbing scissors, comb 
and hair together.
Look out Plebes, for if Fatimas 
dont get you, the Soph Chemicals 
will.
The A. A. E. dance held in the 
Union last Saturday was a great suc
cess. It was well attended, there hew
ing about seventy-five couples pres
ent. The music given by Maggios 
orchestra had lots of pep. Among 
the novelty dances were moonlights, 
a Paul Jones and a Clockwise dance.
A mishap that nearly became a 
calamity occurred when the man from 
whom punch was ordered cut a class. 
It looked like the place was going 
to be a Sahara Desert for a while, 
and it was eleven oclock before the 
Committee succeeded in getting any
thing to quench the thirst of the mul
titude. But when it did come, my 
how it was appreciated.
The patrons and patronesses were 
Mr. and Mrs. Allen II. Blaidsell and 
Mr. and Mrs. Erie S. Hill. The com
mittee in charge was W. C. Seabriglit, 
chairman; J. A. Hubbard and J. IC.

GREAT PROGRESS BEING E BYJEKNON CLUB
The Teknon Club is progressing ev
ery week. Dr. Kerr has been back 
for the last two weeks and has been 
giving very interesting talks to the 
members. The average attendance is 
about twenty eight. On Monday eve
ning of last week a social was held at 
the church (Shadyside Presbyterian) 
at which every one had a good time.
A committee has been organized to 
take up the Y. M. C. A. situation in

taken in a few weeks.
Last week A. C. May was added to 
the membership of the club.

LEAGUE ORGANIZED
On Monday afternoon a meeting of 
class representatives was held to take 
up the subject of class baseball. Be
fore this meeting some of the classes 
have been active along this line, three 
having chosen managers. Many can
didates are already signed up. At the 
meeting it was decided to arrange a 
schedule and make other plans for an 
interclass league. While the move
ment started with classes in Science 
School, it is spreading and Design and 
Industries are also showing great in
terest. The league will, however, be 
interclass and not inter school, so 
each team will be made up from the 
three divisions.
The baseball management has 
promised to support the movement in 
every way possible. Practice is al 
ready being held by some of th" 
teams. The first game will be played 
very soon. The games will be played 
on Saturday mornings and on days 
when the team is away.

N. P. Rice, New
Advertising Director
The Student Activities Board hold 
its regular monthly meeting on April 
14, 1920. The monthly reports of the 
Mens Musical Clubs, the Girls Mu
sical Club, the Baud, the Tartan, and 
the 1920 Thistle were read and ac
cepted. The possibility of waking the 
Mens Musical Clubs self-supporting 
was discussed and it was suggested 
that next year more concerts be given 
with perhaps a holiday trip.
The committee on Womens Activi
ties reported the following as deserv
ing recognition by S. A. B.: M. M. 
Guild, Y. W. C. A., M. M. Athletic 
Association, M. M. Student Somite, M. 
M. Junior and Senior classes. The 
girls musical club has already been 
recognized. This report was accept
ed and tabled for a month in order 
that S. A. 14. might look into these 
organizations more fully.
The M. M. Senior Class, the InterNight School Dance Committee and 
the Campus Week Committee asked 
for appropriations of $75, $1(50, and 
$300 respectively. 'I'he first two requests for appropriations were grant
ed and were justified on the grounds 
that the two bodies represented paid 
an activities fee but could participate 
in only a limited number of activities. 
In regard to the third request it was 
decided that the Campus-We.ok Com
mittee should be aided as much as 
possible. Accordingly it was voted 
that a committee of three be appoint
ed to take up the matter of finances 
of S. A. B. for the remainder of this 
year to determine the sum of moijey 
(not to exceed $300) which the com 
mittee may receive.
A previous motion in regard to the 
editing of the Student Handbook was 
rescinded and it was voted that the 
Dragon Society be allowed to edit 
the Handbook and that the material 
be ready for the inspection of the S. 
A. B. Publicity Committee by the first 
of June.
Upon the recommendation of the 
Advertising Bureau Committee, Nel
son P. Rice was appointed manager 
of the new advertising bureau. He is 
to assume his duties immediately.
NEW HONORARY SOCIETY FORMED BY ARCHITECTS
A new Junior, Senior honorary so
ciety known as The Gargoyle has, 
during* the current school year, been 
formed in the Architectural depart
ment of the Division of Arts. The 
organization was conceived by some 
of the older men in the department 
and after much planning and working 
the society with aims and purposes 
big enough to keep it alive and ac
tive, was formed. The piembers are 
to be chosen from the Sophomore 
class the end of each year, "tag day 
being observed in this connection. As 
yet no pin nor insignia has been se
lected, but ye shall know them by 
their works" is the hope of the so
ciety. The present active members 
are S. P. Stewart, J. I. Simpson, N. 
P. Rice, C. C. Pribeck, R. M. Crosby, 
E. A. Early, it. Schmertz, If. Aspinwall, L. J. Rockwell, Ed. Green.
for the matches will be announced 
and the courts on which the matches 
are to be played will be assigned. 
Matches will be conducted absolutely 
on schedule time and any man not 
present at the time his match is sched
uled will defaulted. It may be pos
sible if notice in advance is given to 
the manager, that the scheduled 
match may have its time changed, but 
this is not promised. Further notice 
of the tournament and the prizes will 
be announced later. It is desired to 
make this tournament us successful 
as possible and all students who do 
play tennis are urged to enter.
The reason for eliminating from the 
general tournament the men who have 
played on the varsity team is to devel
op now players in the institution, the 
varsity players already having proved their standard of play.
The roason for running a separate 
tournament for the varsity team is 
to oncourago players to try for that 
team, and to get a line on the ability 
of the candidates which will have an 
effoct on the selection of the team.

BUSINESS TRAINING COURSE
FOR COLLEGE GRADUATES 
* * *
General Electric Company Offers 
Opportunity to Non-Tcchnical Men.* * *
Recognizing the growing demand 
for trained business administrators, 
the General Electric Company of 
Schenectady, N. Y., has announced a 
new departure in its educational sys
tem by the establishment of a busi
ness training course for College grad
uates without technical education.
This course in business administra
tion is also being extended to include 
the graduates of technical colleges employed in the , Companys Testing 
Department, with the idea of giving 
the prospective engineer a broad busi
ness background for his future work.
In many respects, the new plan re
sembles the training schools establish
ed by such institutions as the Guaran
ty Trust Company, National City 
Bank and the Standard Oil Company, 
and will be conducted along similar 
lines with one or two important ex
ceptions.
The course, says an announce
ment by the Company, is aimed to 
give training in the principles of high
er accounting, a knowledge of which 
is of great importance to those who 
hope to become executives; to ex
plain the essential elements of busi
ness law made necessary by govern
mental supervision of corporations, 
the tax laws, and other complexities 
of our modern economic life; and, 
lastly, to apply this general knowledge 
concretely to the business of the Gen
eral Electric Company, which is noc(Continued on page 3.)

OaklandTHE INTER-CLASS MEET.
It is generally too late that the classes realize the importance of the 
annual inter-class track meet, one of those things which is held to maintain 
the atmosphere of student life and the pep of the institution. The rivalry 
has always been keen among competitors but never have the four classes 
united their efforts to support those who are competing for them. In past 
years, small groups of interested and enthusiastic class mates on the stands, 
which, on the whole was a sad display of class spirit as pertaining to class 
affairs.What you would like to see and what is suggested is that four sections 
of stand be assigned to the four classes and let the classes in a body occupy 
these sections. That ought to create an atmosphere of spirit.
Those of track ability are generally shy and nervous over signing up and 
entering an event. Shake that feeling olT and get out to represent your class, 
this meet is held to bring out promising material, as well as, fulfilling the re
quirements previously discussed. We would like to sec something worth 
while made of this annual affair. Why not have a little action by the classes?

The Grand.
Obe of the screens masterpieces of 
the year, Clara Kimball Youngs mag
nificent production, "The Forbidden 
Woman", will be the leading atraction 
at Pittsburghs New Million Dollar 
Grand all next week, starting Monday 
morning, April 2G. A picture ranking 
with Eyes of Youth and The Mir
acle Man, for dramatic interest and 
artistic creation, it is Miss Youngs 
second offering under her own man
agement and shows the star in a role 
of rare fascination. The story is one 
of romance and intrigue, love and 
hate, joy and sorroy, all interviewed 
in delightful continuity as the autobio
graphical tale of a highly tempera
mental prima-donna coquettewho 
steps dangerously near destruction 
through her inability to flirt seriously 
or take seriously the appeal of her 
heart. Gripping, poignant, full of 
surprises and unusual dramatic vigor, 
it was produced by the same organi
zation responsible for Eyes of 
Youth, a real guarantee of its qual
ity.
A strong program has been built up 
with The Forbidden Woman as its 
peak. There will be a Mack Sennett 
comedy, The Gingham Girl, featur
ing Louise Fazenda; the Grand News 
Weekly and the Topics of the Day. 
The symphony airs with the pictures, 
besides an extra number of entertain
ing value. Both orchestra and pipe 
organ will be all-day features. Per

The New Davis.
Twin stars twinkle In antipodel 
firmaments, and promise to give espe
cial luminosity to the vaudeville heav
ens in the Davis Theatre, twice each 
day next week, beginning Monday af
ternoon, April 20. They are Rose 
Coghlan, the eminent player from the 
legitimate stage, and Ruth Roye, the 
effervescent young woman who re
cently won a loving cup in a New 
York contest designed to determine 
the most popular ragtime songstress. 
Miss Coghlan belongs to the old 
school of the drama, the school to 
which lustre was given by her lament
ed associates, Booth, Barrett, McCul
lough, Wallack and the elder Sothern. 
Her career runs concurrently with 51 
years of stage history, and she is still 
regarded as one of the best players 
the theatre has in the present. Miss 
Coghland has played the role of Step
hanie de Mohrivart in Forget Me 
Not more than a dozen times, and 
will interpret it again in the condens
ed version which she will give in the 
Davis Theatre this week. Her asso
ciates are Lynn Pratt, cAntonio Saler
no and Ethel Wright.
William B. Friedlander is to pre
sent Sneila Terry for the first time in 
Pittsburgh. With Harry Petefson and 
Gattison Jones, she will play Mr. 
Friedlanders new operetta in three 
scenes, entitled Threes A Crowd. 
It is a musical romance put on with 
all the attention to detail of a large 
musical comedy production. There is 
a special conductor for the orchestra 
and a corps of stage mechanicians to 
see that effects and scenery give just 
the right emphasis.
William Sully, of the famous Four 
Sullys, recently released from serv
ice with the Aviation Corps of the 
United States Army, has formed a 
professional alliance with Genevieve 
Houghton, a popular musical comedy 
player, and will present Aaron llofVmans pleasant little skit, entitled,

A cordial welcomc to all Students.
The economy of power is a constant problem 
with the plant superintendent, the factory 
engineer, and the production manager. They 
know that the volume, the cost and the 
quality of the entire factorys output depend 
directly on the success with which a depend
able, uniform flow of power is transmitted to 
the machines.
Full recognition of the value of economical 
transmission is basic in the Goodyear Plant 
Analysis Plan. It may be, as in the case of 
our original installation for The Toledo Cider 
& Vinegar Company, only a single drive that 
the G.T.M.Goodyear Technical Manis 
asked to analyze. But from the outset he 
makes his expert study on the principle that 
a belt is an integral part of the plants pro
duction line.
He surveys the actual conditions under 
which the belt must operate. He figures 
pulley dimensions, center-to-center distances, 
operating speed required. He notes that the 
belt must resist certain acids, or high tem
peratures, or unusual abrasion, flinty dust 
or warm damp. In this particular case, it 
happened to be acetic acid.
The G.T.M.-specified belt, it is logical to 
expect, will stand up to its part in the 
factorys work better than a belt that is
bought on the basis of whatever the jobber 
has in stock. The one the G.T.M. recom
mended for the Toledo company did. It 
held the pulleys, withstood the acid, and 
delivered full power. It lived up to the 
value built into it by the Goodyear manu
facturing ideal,  Protect Our Good Name.
100% Goodyear-equipped today is the 
result of a succession of analyses following 
that first one, plus the service the G.T.M.- 
specified Goodyear Belts have never failed 
to yield. You will note there are different 
types of Goodyear Belting on different drives 
and on pumping duty in this plant. In line 
with the same principle of assuring the rela
tion of every unit to the work of the whole 
plant, the G.T.M. prescribed Goodyear 
Monterey Acid Hose for the conveying of 
the product. At the end of a full seasons 
run, the Goodyear equipment shows prac
tically no wear and has furnished new records 
for energy conserved and power transmitted.
Students and teachers of engineering will 
find the subject of power economy through 
plant analysis practically treated in the 
Goodyear Mechanical Goods Encyclopedia. 
They may obtain copies by letter request to

The electric furnace in actual use

however, developed a furnace which 
gives a temperature of 4500 C, enough 
to volatilize diamonds. A comparison 
of these temperatures with that of the

The Joy of Winter Swimming.
The exercise derived from swimming has not only the endorsement of our leading social workers but our most eminent physicians as well. Mont people indulge in swimming in the good old summer time but the fact remains that the body needs the exercise derived more in winter than in the summer, when it is possible to get outdoors in tin: open and avoid the evils that come from a pent-up life. The last p on to fall ill from colds, coughs and the more serious winter ailments is the habitual winter swimmer, whose flesh becomes hardened and is thus able to resist severe weather. Theres a lot of joy, vigor and wholesome exercise to be derived by swimming that can be had in no other way. The Pittsburg hNatotor- ium Pool is open all winter.

Altho they give you deep and angry

Avoid the sensuous shimmies oily

And greet our Geek with soft and

GEARS MADE FROM COTTON 
HAVE MANY ADVANTAGES* * *
Designed Primarily to Reduce Noise 
Construction Very Simple.* * *
The Fabroil gear, known as' the 
cloth pinion, was originally developed 
by the General Electric Company to 
eliminate some gear troubles in thenown factory. They are primarily de
signed to reduce the noise of the aver
age gear train, and a long and exhaus
tive course of research was necessary 
to find a material which would meet 
the heavy service requirements of a 
gear, and still retain the noiseless fea
ture.
After trying out many possible ma
terials, both metallic and non-metallic 
the choice was narrowed down to two 
possibilities, steel and compressed 
cotton. The steel gear was found to 
make such a nerve racking noise to
to be impossible, so the cotton gear 
was the ultimate choice.
The construction of these gears, 
when the service they furnish and the 
conditions they meet are considered, 
is very simple. Specially selected cot
ton is wound around a drum, capped 
and bottomed with steel shrouds of 
the required size, the whole is then 
compressed hydraulicly to the proper 
dimensions. Sometimes the cotton 
is given a vacuum oil treatment. When 
the gears are sufficiently compressed, 
they are bored for holding pins, which 
clamp the shrouds at the required dis
tance, and maintain the pressure on 
the cotton filler. For special instances 
these shrouds or end plates, are made 
of bronze or other metal, but the 
standard material is steel.
The result is a gear which is just as 
wearing as case iron, which can be 
run in oil or without. Its elasticity 
gives it a greater and closer surface 
contact than the ordinary gear, and it 
is not affected by steam, hot waiter, 
or any other condition of service 
which is liable to prove ruinous to 
iron gears.
Outside of its durability, the Fabroil 
Gear is absolutely noiseless, even 
when it is meshed with a metal gear 
in the train. The gear specially de
signed for automobiles, is a prominent 
example of this noiselessness, for 
there the slightest grinding is much 
more apparent than when gears are 
operating in a factory where a multi
plicity of noises tend to distract the 
ear. The gears have an infiinite num
ber of applications; they are being 
used on printing presses, lathes, bor
ing mills, pumps, air compressors and, 
in fact almost any place where gear 
reduction is necessary. As stated be
fore, the gear designed for automo
biles has found an application on some 
well known types of engines.
Another feature that is incidental, 
but unusual, is that spare gears, either 
blank or already cut, may be stored 
for years in all sorts of places and at
mospheric conditions without shrink
age, diametrically or otherwise, and 
without fear of destruction by rats 
or other vermin.

COLLEGE CHATTER
After 10 consecutive victories seven over league teams, and with the sea
son nearly over, Pennsylvania is prac
tically assured of capturing the Inter
collegiate Basketball Championship 
and the Heppe Trophy. The latter, 
which has been contested for by the 
six teams in the league for the past 
nine years, goes to Penn as a result
THE TARTAN.
of their third successful year in the 
intercollegiate race.
Besides leading the league as a 
team, Penn has a man at the top of 
the list in individual scoring. Sween
ey, although his lead over Van Slyck, 
of Yale, is small, has the advantage in 
that Penn has one more game to play 
than the Eli quintet. With this help 
Sweeney is certain of holding his 
place.* * *
That honor may be won in other 
ways than on the athletic field is the 
belief of Georgia Tech. This is illus
trated by the manner in which they 
award the Gold Ts. The ten men 
of the Senior Class, who have made 
the highest average for their previous 
three years, are awarded emblems as 
a recognition of their good work.* * *
The women of Swarthmore are go
ing to try out the point system, which 
had been rejected by the men. At a 
meeting of the Womens Student Gov
ernment Association, the plan was
thoroughly discussed and adopted.
The main objection raised was the dis
couragement that it would give to ath
letics. It was claimed that under the 
old system too few girls were inter
ested in athletics, and fewer would go 
out for the teams because they would 
obtain their quota of points in other 
activities. It was finally voted to 
adopt the system, but that points 
should not be given for athletic hon
ors.* * *
A proposal to change the rules of 
football so the length of a game will 
be regulated by the number of plays 
instead of by time, will be consider
ed at the next meething of the foot
ball rules committee. The plan ad
vanced by Harry R. Coffin, a Harvard 
graduate, is said to have the indorse
ment of Walter Camp, Percy D. 
Haughton and others prominent in the 
sport.
The object is to overcome the wide 
variation in the number of plays in 
contests directed by different officials
and to prevent a team which is lead
ing from delaying in order to consume 
time. Mr. Coffin advocates a -10-play 
period, with tries for goal after touch
down and penalties for fouls not 
counted as plays.

BUSINESS TRAINING COURSE 
(Continued from page 1.) 
essarily intricate owing to the size of 
the organization, the volume of its 
sales, and the wide range of articles 
manufactured.
The training course consists of ac
tual employment during the business 
day, in one of the accounting depart
ments where the student will become 
familiar with the practical work and 
the departmental functions. The class 
work will engage the best efforts of 
the student for eight or ten hours 
each week outside of the class periods, 
which are held two evenings a week 
from 5:30 to 7:30. The course is di
vided into semesters, and is in prog
ress during the usual months of the college year.
The International General Electric 
Company, Inc., a separate corporation 
recently formed to handle the foreign 
business of the parent concern, is 
planning to establish a similar course 
of training for students who will 
represent it in the foreign field in 
various capacities. A course in foreign 
exchange will be one of the features 
of the curriculum.
The demand for men competent to 
fill positions in the various works and 
offiqes of the Company both in this 
country and abroad, concludes the 
announcement, calls for men with 
thorough training not only in business 
theory and practice, but also in the 
methods of the Company. The special 
course in business methods is design
ee! to meet this need.
The General Electric Company now 
employs in its technical training de
portments from 400 to 500 college 
graduates every year. Students from 
20 foreign countries are represented 
In this enrollment.
