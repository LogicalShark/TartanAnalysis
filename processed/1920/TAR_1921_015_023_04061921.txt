MUSICAL CLUB
CASSIUS ENGAGEMENT 
AT ARTS THEATER
The Cassilis Engagement, by St. 
John Hankin, the latest production of 
the School of Drama, produces a 
mingled effect of satisfaction and 
disappointment, of which the first 
feeling fortunately predominates. The 
piece itself is of a type not frequent
ly seen on our Tech stage, the light 
English comedy which hardly en
gages ones emotions, but furnishes 
fine-spun entertainment m the wit of 
the well-bred and vulgarities of a.person from low life. The action arises 
from, and shows the dissolution of, an 
ill-advised engagement between the 
scion of a County family and a girl 
from a household whose colossal vul
garity pants for respectability. The 
mainspring of the pieces humor is 
the incessant contrast in breeding and 
behavior, in manner and precept,'be
tween these hostile social groups, un
happily linked through the heros 
blindness in love. As Hankin de
velops the situation with a conscious 
leisureliness, the interest of the first 
two acts is that of bright conversa
tion rather than action, an interest 
somewhat alien to Americans, of 
whom it has been said that though 
they talk, they never converse.y 
Thereafter the action quickens in 
terms of conflict, and the play sweeps 
to an effective dramatic conclusion.
Subtleties of manner and delicacies 
of perception are what many of the 
roles require, fruits of an experience 
not universal among us. Nevertheless, 
since almost any behavior would seem 
refinement in the face of Mrs. Borridges commonness, the neaessary 
contrasts are not wanting. The sturdy 
humors of the piece find expression in

The Carnegie Tech Musical Clubs 
on April 15 in the Carnegie Music 
Hall will give their sixteenth annual 
home concert. The musical clubs this 
year have given tnany out of town 
concerts and the home concert is the 
conclusion of their concert season.
The program will consist of selec
tions by the Glee Club and by the 
Mandolin Club. Several specialties 
have been planned and among them 
is a saxophone quartette. Bill 
Rieley is also on the program with 
an entirely new act. A dance will be 
held in the Schenley Hotel ball room 
immediately after the concert. Prices 
range from .50 cents to $1.50 for the 
concert and holders of the $1.00 and 
$1.50 tickets may obtain tickets for the 
dance at $1.00 a couple. Preliminary 
tickets may be bought on the campus 
from any members of the clubs and 
will be exchanged for final tickets the 
week of the 10th in the Central build
ing.
"CZECHO NIGHT IN 
[APRIL 9
The Cosmopolitan Club of Carnegie 
Tech will give anotherof its series of 
National Nights.. The past ones ,the 
French Night and the Roumanian 
Night, have scored a hit. Those at
tending these programs given by the 
club are always sure of seeing and 
heiiring something of Interest which 
is characteristic of the nation repre
sented. This time our American 
friends and others interested will 
have the opportunity to learn some
thing about the people of the new 
republic of Central Europe, Czecho
slovakia.
The program and entertainment 
which is being arranged for Czecho
slovak Night is going to be the most 
elaborate of any so far given. It will 
include such a speaker as Mr. Albert 
Mamatey,-former instructor at Tech, 
a man who pushed and boosted Tech 
when the school was yet in its in
fancy. At present Mr. Mamatey is 
consul of the Republic of Czecho
slovakia at Pittsburgh.
At this event the students and fac
ulty will be given the opportunity of 
seeing a real Czecho-Slovak Folk 
Dance, a dance which brings out one 
of the aesthetic characteristics of the 
people of that country. Also, if there 
are any who are interested in acro
batics in any way, they will find that 
the Czecho-Slovak Sokols (Falcons) 
are first-class gymnasts. Needless to 
say, music of the highest order will 
be heard, which is universally found 
among the Czechs. And if you have 
never eaten some of that delicious 
Czecho-Slovak pastry, Kolace, as it 
is termed in the native tongue, you 
had better come this evening for this 
if for nothing else.
After the regular program those 
interested will he given an oppor
tunity to see some unique Czecho
slovak embroidery and art needle
work as well as the native costume.

KAPPA SIGMA GRANTS CHAPTER
Kappa Sigma Fraternity on March
14 granted a chapter to the Oplieleum 
Fraternity. This group of men when 
organized wafe known as the Boosters 
Club and in 1913 they re-organized and 
were known as the Oplieleum 
Fraternity. Despite the depression of 
the war period it survived as one of 
the' leading fraternities at Tech. In 
January, 1920, permanent quurtera 
were established on Clyde street.
.The Tech chapter of Kappa Sigma 
will be the 89th organization to re
ceive a charter and installation will 
take place on April 11, 12 and 13. 
Representatives and alumni from 
Pitt, \V. & J., Penn State and W. Va. 
will officiate. The Tech chapter will 
complete a strong organization of 
Kappa Sigma in this district as there 
are some 300 odd alumni in Pittsburgh.
INTERCOLLEGIATE 
DEBATE APRIL 15
On Friday evening, April 15, 1921, 
Tech will held, its first intercollegiate 
debate when the affirmative team 
meets West Virginia. The nogative 
Loam journeys to Washington, Pa., 
to meet W. & J. The question to be 
debated by both teams is: Resolved, 
That the several states should enact 
legislation providing Tor the estab
lishment of courts of industrial rela
tions similar to the Kansas court. 
Members of the teams representing us 
have been coached by Professor Pet
erson of the English department.
This Is a live question on one of the 
most perplexing national problems of 
the day and the Kansas court, more or 
less an innovation, has aroused much 
comment, both for and against, Jn 
nearly every state In the Union. A 
similar law is pending in the legis
latures of several of the states to
day. The question was debated by 
Governor Allen of Kansas and Sam
uel G'ompers last fall in New York 
City and many points, good and bad, 
were brought out.. Since that time 
many new developments in the in
dustrial situation have given rise to 
the issuance of an abundance of 
material on either side of the ques
tion.
No doubt anyone who hears the 
debate will derive a better under
standing of labor difficulties, for they 
will hear both sides of the question 
discussed. The men representing 
Tech have spent nearly two months of 
(Continued on Pafce Two.)
STUDENT EMPLOYMENT
During the past few months em
ployment conditions have become very 
critical in the Pittsburgh district. 
Due to such conditions the Bureau 
has found it very difficult to place 
many of its applicants. We feel this 
depression has affected the day stud
ents more than any of our other ap
plicants, because they depend more 
entirely upon their earnings to put 
them through college.
At the present time most of the 
positions we have open for day stuents are in sales work. These positions 
will pay on salary and commission 
basis, not a great deal of time is re
quired, but the time that would be de
voted to this work must be concen
trated. . In the event your financial 
condition compels you to take this 
kind of work, please come to the 
Bureau your first opportunity.
The Bureau, as every other organi
zation, is bucking against hard times, 
but we are willing to do .all we can 
for the students. We ask that you 
consider our service always open to 
you and if possible we will try to lift 
from your shoulders some of the 
present financial worries.

May 12, 13 and 14, have nearly been 
completed. From indications it will 
be a celebration that will for a long 
time be a pleasant reminiscence * to 
the alumni and undergraduates. Last 
years festival was enjoyed and ap
preciated by everyone, but it was an 
innovation. This year the plans are 
more elaborate and extensive. By 
getting an early start the program is 
to be worked out more carefully.
The tentative program has been an
nounced and It looks as though there 
is to be uo lack of action, for some
thing will be happening all the 
time.
The hilarity commences at 10:30 
Thursday morning, May 12, with a 
parade from the campus to Carnegie 
Music Hall, where an assembly will be 
hold with appropriate exorcises. Follow

Initiation Into the Carnegie Clan by 
burning his Freshman hat, black tie 
and socks and put on somo local color.

THE HOME STRETCH
With the opening of the Spring Quarter wc are starting out on 
tho last lap of the year work. Before us is.the hardest task of all, 
that of getting back into the traces, which is in itself a hardship, and 
then sticking to the job in spite of the fact that nature seems to be 
doing her best to entice us away from our work. The first indications 
of Spring Fever were apparent even before the Easter Holidays, 
when it was about as hard as pulling teeth to stay in and study. ISiow 
the symptoms will be even worse, when the immediate need for prep
aration does not seem so necessary. That desire to throw text and 
note-books aside and spend an hour or two on the tennis courts or 
the ball diamond; with the possibility of an afternoon in some nook 
in the park becoming more and more inviting; wili be hard to resist.
We dont know how successful we are going to be in resisting 
the call. We dont want to resist it altogether, because we will be 
losing something if we do. But we do want to be able to so regulate 
our Spring Fever temperature that it will not be a case of all play 
and no work. Wc have all managed to do so in the past, more or 
less successfully, and we can no doubt do so again. Nevertheless 
it is well to be prepared against the insiduous bacilli whose attacks 
are just beginning to be noticeable. No one wants to fall down on 
the last lap of the race.
HONOR TO WHOM
What appears to have been a long felt want in the.organizations 
at Tech has at last been filled by the formation of a. Womens 
Honorary Society. There have been a number of Honorary Frater
nities and Societies on the Campus for years. Their object has been 
to recognize good work in either scholarship or activities, or both, 
on the part of the students.' But strangely, not one of them has 
recognized, to our knowledge, the fact that our co-eds might be eli
gible on these counts. There is. no apparent reason why women 
should not have been included in at least one ol! the organizations we 
could mention, but they have been ignored. Now, with the sanction 
and advice of the faculty and administration, the seniors of the 
Margaret Morrison .Division, and the co-ed seniors o 1! the Arts Divi
sion have united to organize a Senior Honorary Society. The charter 
members have been chosen by the faculty, and members of the pres
ent Junior classes of both divisions will be tapped on Tap Day in the 
same manner as are those elected to the present honorary societies.
Members are to be chosen both for scholastic excellence and par
ticipation in activities, Everyono selected for the honor will be 
fully deserving to be called a Representative Tech Woman, a title 
worth the most untiring efforts to obtain.
WE WONDER!
Alitor reading the article by Helen Rutledge in Tho Collegiate 
World I'or April, and by Helen Bullitt Lowry in the New York Times 
Book Review ol! March 27, we bflgin to sit up and wonder what we 
have boon missing this past year. II! all their statements are true 
well, read the articles Ior yourself.___________________________

PLANS FOR CAMPUS
WEEK COMPLETED
(Continued From Page One.)
Tap Day exorcises will follow. The 
honorary societies will announce elec
tions. This should he of much interest 
to underclassmen. Over on the tennis 
courts about the same time Col. 
Brooks varsity team will bo showing 
some of last years form against a 
rival outfit whose identity has not yet 
been determined. After dinner there 
will be a big out of doors concert by 
the musical organizations, starting at 
8 oclock. There will be numbers by 
the Glee Club, Mandolin Club, M. M. 
D. Stringers, the Band, Design Jazz 
Orchestra and Tech Symphony Or
chestra. Some variety of musical! 
treats. Then dancing until 1 oclock 
in the Arts Building, Langley Labor
atory and Union. Music by the De
sign Jazz Band and other celebrated 
Pittsburgh artists. Take a mile walk 
if you arent tired by this time.
Friday, May 13. Don* be super
stitious. Be there! Time, 10:30; 
place, Central building; event, Second 
Annual Interfraternity Push-mobile 
Sweepstakes. The course is through 
the park, finishing where they started, 
if possible. Undoubtedly it will be 
an unlucky day for some of the en
trants. A silver cup will be awarded 
the longest winded team. After the 
smoke has cleared the wounded car
ried from the field and the winners 
decorated, another deadly combat is 
scheduled. The Seniors will take a 
swing at the faculty in a game of 
baseball. See this, eat and hurry 
back for the varsity game. We want 
to make it two straight. After the 
game show the alumni our new im
provements, eat dinner and come 
back for the Mardi Gras by the Mag
gie Murphs. There will be torches, 
horns; confetti, masquerade costumes 
and stunts. Lots of noise and show. 
The remainder of the evening is to be 
taken up by dancing at the Langley 
Laboratory.
Saturday morning the R. O. T. C. will 
show us how it was done when the 
Germans were advancing on Paris. 
Again some more baseball. This time 
the alumni will show the varsity boys 
how they used to play ball. During 
the rest of the day a regular circus 
and all that goes with it, side shows, 
peanuts, lemonade, popcorn, wild 
men and everything except elephants. 
To close the historic festival there 
will be a huge bonfire on the athletic 
field. In addition to the big show the 
fraternities will have alumni reunions, 
dances and open houses.
It is the duty of every Techite to 
put something into this festival, to 
do something to put it over and make 
our alumni feel that they have had 
their money's worth and will be with 
us again next year and following 
years. Make "Campus Week the best 
three days you yourself spent at col
lege and an event you will enjoy re
turning to after you leave school.
admiration.
Mr. Colpitts wears his clothes with 
grace, but he can hardly be said to 
act his admittedly idiotic part. He 
reads his lines with an ennui which 
is contagious. Of the minor parts, 
Mr. Reid's bibulous and racketty 
bachelor is the most carefully dis
tinguished. To his scenes with both 
the lovers he gives suavity and a re
sourceful worldliness which is at
tractive to more than Miss Eorridge. 
Miss Zeile as the overwhelming dow
ager, the Countess of Remenham, car
ries the conversation of the first act 
upon her not unready shoulders,' and 
Miss Crowe embellishes the acidity of 
Lady Marchmont with an admirable 
manner. Miss Mering needs only a 
tithe of her charm for the colorless 
Mabel, and her singing is ^delightful. 
Mr. McConnells Rector is squelched 
almost into indistinctness by his ag
gressive spouse (Miss Hannon).

CASGILIS ENGAGEMENT
(Continued From Page One.) 
Miss Lotzs impersonation of the 
fiancees mother. In manner, in 
dress, in speech, her vulgarity is 
splendid, and her outburst of un
controlled weeping is powerful. What 
is cleverer is her representation of the 
authors decent fair play with the vul
garians yearning for better things, 
and the pathos of her discoirifiture. 
Miss Dice finds in Mrs. Cassilis a role 
in which she may be as sweet and 
fine as she pleases. Her total 'effect 
in the earlier performance was some
what monotonous; she does not reach 
the depths of feeling which Her lines 
suggest, nor does one sense the cold, 
hard grip beneath the glove of silk. 
Miss Bassinger conveys the honest 
cynicism and the honest appetite for 
iife of tho fiancee. She is calculating 
and discreet till her inevitable bore
dom drives her into open and scanda
lous rebellion.
Miss Floyd in the same role is more 
successful in making the engagement 
credible than in showing its dissolu
tion inevitable. She stresses the amia
bility rather than the ambition of the 
heroine; her consequent reward is 
sympathy where Miss Bassingers is

The Cumulative Value of 
Selling Life Insurance
Men and women who are preparing for a career will 
do well to recognize, at the outset, the fact that in 
most pursuits income,ceases immediately when the 
worker ceases his efforts.
In most professions time adds only valuable experi
ence which must be converted by actual practice 
into financial reward.
Unlike most other professions, the Life Insurance 
Business does not exhaust your energies today 
'and eject you tomorrow. A forced suspension of 
your activity does not suspend your income in our 
business.
This is well worth considering in choosing your 
career.
The Edward A. Woods Company of Pittsburgh 
wants to tell you the wonderful success trained men 
are meeting in the field of Life Insurance.
A letter will bring you a fuller discussion.

year has graduated. Thiee men who 
won their letters though are back 
and it is around them the 1921 team

Schmertz and Copley are the letter 
man who will probably be on the 
team with Keil, Roger Marshall, 
Johnston and Brosky, new men who 
will make strong bids for places. 
Keil was formerly a varsiiy man at 
Wittenburg and won the ournament 
last fall.
The schedule has not been com

COLD WEATHER HANDICAPS 
PRACTICE OF BASEBALL TEAM
A week of cold -weather' has hand
icapped the baseball -squad in their 
I reparation for the opeuing of the 
season with Virginia Poytech at 
FJattsburg on Thursday. The warm 
days gave way to snow and rain 
after Easter Sunday and have hin
dered Wagners proteges in their 
loosening up process and taking the 
kinks out.of stale muscles.
Captain Ray Daugherty has been 
directing most of the prastice ses
sions and keeps the squhd on their 
toes throughout. The infield looks 
to be better than any which .has 
represented Tech in a good many 
years. It will be made up of the 
same men who held it down last 
year in such good style and being 
composed of veterans should be beti er than ever.
Last Saturday was the first real 
workout they have had for over a 
week and <he warm sun put a lot 
of pep into everybody. An infield 
composed of Bob Kessler, Jim Dur
kin, Jim Daugherty and Sunny 
Price augmented with Teen men took 
the field against the Plaid regulars 
and staged a fast practice game.
Several new men have come out 
for outfield positions and will give 
Coach "Wagner a larger number to 
choose from. Johnson, Robeitson and 
Pc-.terson look promising and will 
make some of the others step out 
for berths on the team.
The pitching staff should show a 
lot of strength with four men going 
good at this time. It will probably 
be composed of McCaw, Weiss, Cappe 
and Conrad All are right handers 
and with the exception of Weiss over
hand pitchers. Weiss throws under
hand a majority of the time with an 
occasional side arm ball.
Every man out is playing hard to 
make the southern trip this week 
and the team will make a great ef
fort to heat the three Virginia 
schools. After the Virginia Polytech 
game the Plaid nine will travel to 
Lexington whefe they play Wash
ington and Lee and Virginia Military 
Institute.
S. A. E. WINS BASKET BALL 
PENNANT IN NATIONAL LEAGUE
The standing of the Frat.-Dorm 
basket ball teams show that Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon has won the pennant 
in tne American League and Sigma 
Nu and Tau Gamma Phi are tied for 
first place in tne National. The S. 
A. E. team is only one in either 
league to have a perfect record, they 
having won all their games Beta 
Theta Pi came in a good sfcond in 
the American League race, having 
lost only one contest.
Ihe tie in the National League 
race will be played off .sometime this 
week, 'and a close and iaot game 
may be expected. After .lie pennant 
,n the National League &as been de
cided the championship contest for 
the  cup will be staged. Which 
league is the strongest is a much 
discussed question and won't be de
cided until the winners of each 
league play together.

TRACK TEAM WORKING
HARD FOR PENN RELAYS
Coach Iddings of the track squad 
is busy with his men rounding them 
into shape for future meets. | He is 
spending the majority of his time 
now with the men who will try out 
for the relay team to represent Tech 
at the Penn Relays on April 30, in 
Philadelphia. This is first and one 
of the biggest events on the Plaid 
track schedule. The Penn relays 
have come to be about the biggest 
collegiate track event In the country 
and attract nation-wide interest. 
Over 100 colleges have already sent 
in their entries and over a thousaud 
men will take part.
Last year the Plaid relay team 
made an excellent showing and were 
lar in the lead in their race when 
ac unfortunate accident to one of the 
runners occurred. Just what class 
the Tech team will run in has not 
been decided by the offcia's of the 
meet.
In addition to the relay men 
which Coach Iddings will send to 
Philadelphia he may take along two 
or three sprinters. The only thing 
against this is that the sprinters are 
tiying out for the relay team also and 
ii; they make a place on it will be 
held with .Allegheny on May 7 at 
Schenley Oval. The Meadville track 
team is a good one this year and 
shoull give the Plaid cinder men 
stiff competition. The meet will take 
place on the same day lhat the 
Tech Inter-scliolastic meat will be 
held. Manager McGill has been re
ceiving a large number of entries 
from, schools in this district and one 
of the best scholastic meets ever held 
at the Oval is looked forward to. 
Last year about forty schools were 
represented and fast time was made 
in each event. Schenley High School 
of Pittsburgh won the meet with the 
most points. Scott High of Toledo, 
rent down a relay team and won this 
event in handy fashion.
The cold weather has retarded the 
work of the men on the squad and 
they are not. as far advanced as they 
expected to be at this time. Now 
cinders are being spread on the 
track and it will be in first class 
shape for the men this week.

Pittsburgh.
RIFLE TEAM BREAKS EVEN
The Rifle Team has practically fin
ished its first season, having but two 
matches left. One of these is a dual 
with Colgate and the indications point 
that Tech should take them over. 
The other matches is the final 
one of the Intercollegiate matches. 
There is no reason why Tech should 
not win the Intercollegiate matches 
nert year, for we have our range and 
practice can start at the first of the 
year. There should 'be no obstacle to 
hold up practice, and it is practice 
that makes a winning team in rifle as 
well as in other sports. The dual 
matches to date:
Harvard .......4S1 Tech............. 4S5
Princeton ___ 4S5 Tech............. 4S4
Columbia ___ 402 Tech............. 421
Drexel ........... 499 Tech............. 479
Opponents ...1867 Tech..............1S69
The indications are that Tech will 
shoot about fourth in the Intercollegiates, out of a field of 27 colleges in 
the country. The showing of the Tech 
team Is remarkable for a first year. 
Few new sports do as well. Much 
credit- is due to the team and rifle 
club men for the spirit they have 
shown in building their range and 
financing the team, not drawing on 
the athletic fund in any way.
Hymn Quickly Composed.
Perhaps the most quickly written 
hymn was "From Greeenlands Icy 
Mountains, which was composed by 
Bishop Heber In little more than flftf-on minutes.

The Seven Seaa.
Did Kipling consult Hindu mythol
ogy when choosing the title for his 
well-known book. The Seven Seas? 
According to the Puranas, the earth la 
circular and flat, like the flower of a 
water lllv. Its circumference Is 1,000,- 
000,000 miles. In the center is Mount 
Soomeroo.
Who Was Moseley?
HE was a young Oxford man, only twenty-seven when 
he was killed at Gallipoli. Up to his time, man had 
never seen the inside of an atom. He turned the 
X-rays on matternot figuratively but literallyand made 
them disclose the skeleton of an atom just as certainly as a 
surgeon makes them reveal the positions of the bones of the 
body. Moseley proved that all atoms are built up of the 
same kind of matter. He saw, too, just why an atom of 
copper is different from an atom of gold.
Atoms are built up of electrons. Each atom consists of 
a nucleus, a kind of sun, with a certain number of electrons 
grouped about it, like planets. Moseley actually counted 
the number of electrons of all the metals from aluminum 
to gold.
When you discover what gold is mlide of or a new fact 
about electricity, you open up new possibilities for the use 
of gold or electricity. For that reason the Research Labora
tories of the General Electric Company are as much con
cerned with the how of thingsatoms and electrons, for 
instanceas they are with mere applications of the electric 
current.
Hence Moseleys work has been continued in the Re
search Laboratories, with the result that more has been 
learned about matter. How does water freeze? What islead? Why are lead, iron, gold and tungsten malleable? 
Such questions can be answered more definitely now than 
ten years ago. And because they can be answered it is 
possible to make more rapid progress in illumination, in 
X-ray photography, in wireless telegraphy, and in elec
trical engineering as a whole.
'fhere would have been no coal-tar industry without the 
vast amount of research conducted in organic chemistry, 
and no electro-chemical industry without such work as Sir 
Humphrey Daveys purely scientific study of an electric 
currents effect on caustic potash and caustic soda. Sooner 
or later research in pure science always enriches the world 
with discoveries that can be practically applied. For these 
reasons the Research Laboratories of the General Electric 
Company devote so much time to the study of purely 
scientific problems.

CARNEGIE TECH RING; WHAT SHOULD IT BE?

Tech alumni who are interested in 
her advancement and take pride in 
seeing her placed in the -first rank 
with other large colleges scholastic
ally, should also equally be interested 
In seeing her in the front rank wear
ing some insignia distinguishing a 
Tech graduate. When a naval officer 
is soen Hashing a ring, not an or
dinary one but one which attracts at
tention and admiration, we know at 
once I hat he is an Annapolis grad
uate. To this end is the ring com
mittee of the 1921 class working, en
deavoring to establish a ring which 
will be truly a Tech ring signifying 
that the weareipis a Tech graduate.
Many objections have been voiced 
by the alumni. The chief one is that 
the class 6f 1916 by a vote of all 
classes established a "standard ring," 
and that by the action of the com
mittee this year their rings lose the 
significance attached to them. The 
action of the class of 1916, however, 
was not all that was necessary to 
make the ring standard. The alumni 
al that time were not asked for their 
opinion, for it seemed to be a case of 
their following meekly on; the mat
ter was not brought to the attention 
of the administrative council, whose 
action would tend to make the ring 
truly standard, and further alterations 
necessarily out of place.
Without any discredit to the ring 
committee of 1916, the adoption of a 
ring then was not done in the proper 
manner. This is evident from the 
fact that when the class of 1017 came 
to get their rings the die for the 16" 
standard ring could not be found and 
consequently this class had a new 
ring designed. So from the outset 
standardization was lost. Each suc
ceeding class has had a ring made to 
suit themselves and so any efforts 
towards standardization have !been 
lost. Now that the question has 
come up again the ring com
mittee has decided to leave no stones 
unturned in having a ring made' 
standard, and also selecting one 
which will be unmistakably Tech.
The ring committee now working 
can readily put Itself in the place of 
the graduates and see just what ob
jections they might have upon learn
ing that another attempt is being 
made along linos of standardization 
and a change in design. II. is realized 
that eventually rings now being worn 
will in the future mean nothing when 
onco a new standard ring becomes 
known. But if the attempts of the 
committee this year bring the re
sults now lndlcntod along linos of a 
design, it is not going to r>tep too far 
in believing that tlio alumni will keep 
some Jewolor prossed for orders.
What wo need Is a ring that will 
not lie a class ring with numerals on 
It, such as always soon on , a high 
school ring, but a dogroo ring so that 
wherever It Is soon It will distinguish 
you as a Tech graduate. Gan It bo 
truly said that the rings now being 
worn are a credit to a school of the 
calibre of Tech? Ono alumnus was 
taken back a bit because soiho ono 
ask' d him "what high school ring Is 
that?" The ring or rings we now 
have lack the distinguishing elements 
of a real collegiate ring.
The committee now at work lias 
been increased so that it is not com
posed wholly of student members. The 
aid of Miss Stewart and Mr. Tilbrook 
as your representatives, has been 
secured and they are working with 
the same interest as ono of the stud
ent members might. Furthermore the 
aid and expert advice of Miss Hewitt 
of the Arts Crafts Department and 
Mr. Bailey Ellis of the Department of 
Applied Arts has been secured and 
they are the regular attendants at the 
meetings of the committee. You can 
readily see that with such a commit
tee at work on the proposition that 
matters will not be dropped until some 
final decision has been reached., both 
as to standardization and design.
Just how the committee will make 
the ring truly standard is being 
worked out in detail and the com
pleted plans are not. at present suffi
cient to warrant publishing. However 
further progress along this line will 
be reported weekly in this column 
and the committee will be glad to re
ceive any criticisms or suggestions 
that you may desiro to make. When 
some definite conclusion is reached 
you will have ample chance to make 
known your pleasure or displeasure.
