Entertainment Will Include 
Artistic Dancing and 
Varied Stunts
Final preparations have been made 
for the annual banquet of the mens 
Junior class which will be held at 
the Lincoln. Club on Craft avenue 
this Thursday evening at 6:15 p. in.
The banquet tables will be arrang
ed in the shape of a large horseshoewith the entertainment stand in the 
middle. This arrangement enables 
everyone to obtain a good view of 
the entertainment from any seat 
along the table. The banquet .hall 
will be gaily decorated and attrac
tiveness and novelty have been 
stressed in the decorations.
On  this large white horseshoe table, 
symbolic of good luck, a banquet will 
be spread that is fit for kings and 
Juniors. No trouble and expense has 
been spared in obtaining the best 
menu for the occasion. The Lincoln 
Club cuisine is noted for its savory 
and well prepared meals and such a 
hearty one will immediately introduce 
cheerfulness, pep and enthusiasm in
to the banquet.
To further instill good feelings apd 
enthusiasm and to keep it at an ever 
increasing pitch, the entertainment 
committee have chosen the Carnegians orchestra to play during the en
tire . banquet.
A rip-roaring time has been the 
standard used by the entertainment 
committee in the selection of enter
tainment for the evening and every 
precaution has been taken to provide 
it. The real diversion of the affair 
will be artistic dancing of varied 
types and it will be extremely satis
factory and pleasurable to the Jun
iors. Other features of the program 
will contain amusing stunts that l^ave 
been prepared by the committee. The 
nature of these stunts were not di
vulged and they will remain secret 
until the night of the banquet.
The Junior banquet committee have 
issued an edict that there shall be

SCIENCE STAG TROPHY 
CUP WON BY JUNIORS; 
LARGE CROWD PRESENT
What ho, the freshman! Lower 
the portculliis! The enemy approach
ed the citadel located on the second 
floor of a Liberty avenue restaurant. 
The besieged leaned out of the win
dow and hurled defiance and taunts ar 
the attacking forces. Some of them 
in fits of frenzy,even went so far as 
to hurl banana peelings at the crowd 
below. Police aided the defenders of 
the castle with drawn maces which 
were effective to the point of becom
ing a nuisance to the besiegers.
Soon the worst was over. The fair 
coystive, Donald Putt, was released 
to the hostile sophomores below. A 
truce was declared and now all goes 
well in the camps of both the com
batants.
The plebe banquet is now a thing 
of the past. Their sumptuous repast, 
which was a three-course dinner in 
eluding bananas and paper plates, 
was served in the Crystal dining 
room on Liberty avenue.
The banquet was originally sched
uled for the Chatani Hotel roof, but 
at the last minute the erring chairman 
in a frenzied hour of the deadly soph
omores ; made a final change and
turned from the fair Chatham to a 
Greek goddess. The Grecian with much 
profit to herself and much loss to the 
plebes enticed him into her castle. 
She tempted him until with glowing 
accounts of a festive board heavy 
with "rays coffee and "ros bif 
sanich-' and she crooned into his 
most receptive ears that now famous 
diitty, Yes, We Have No Bananas.
Atten thirty the plebes gathered 
at the Sixteenth street bridge to 
march in a body to the citadel. Just 
as they were ready to march, a wave 
of consternation swept over them. 
They had misplaced two of their most 
valued committeemen. With down
cast spirits they trudged wearily to 
the Grecian, stronghold.
In the interim the misplaced com
mitteemen were scampering madly 
over the cobblestones and wood blocks 
of Pittsburgh. A double question was 
assailing their minds. Would they 
bo detected by the vigilant sopho
mores? Where was the banquet be
ing held? They finally in despera
tion cast desperation to the winds and 
asked the worldly wise sophomores 
to aid them in locating their banquet.
for their efforts they reaped an im
mediate reward, and were led to the 
site of tlie paper pl&te banquet.
After much trouble and explaining 
they managed to get into tho sacred 
Greek sanctum In tune to partake of 
the desert. One would hardly feel 
justified in saying that they got their 
just desorts after all of their work.
Following the desort came the entainment of the evening. The speak
er of the evening was Prof. H. K. 
Kirk Patrick of the English Depart-ment. Prof. Kirk Patrick spoke on 
class spirit and class unity and his 
talk was most effective. In fact, it 
led a great number of the plebes who 
had crashed , the door to come 
tjhrough> and pay Cor the banquet. 
The dancers who were to have d> 
lighted the plebes with their exotic 
antics were not forthcoming. Through 
some misunderstanding, the sopho
mores became moved at the sad plight 
of entertainers without an entertain
ment. They broke down and taking a 
vast sum of money from their ever 
replenished treasury they paid the 
entertainers for services unperformed,

TRI-PUBLICATIONS STAFF
TO HOLD DANCE JANUARY 9
Tho Trl-Publlcation Stuff will gtvo | 
an informal dance on Saturday night, 
January 9. from S:S0 to 12:00 oclock. 
The committee in charge of the dance 
is planning to secure an out-of-town 
orchestra and soveral novelty attrac
tions will add spice to the program.
The Tri-Publication staff was estab
lished during the past year for tho 
publication of the Student Handbook, 
the Student Directory, and other min
or student publications.
Last year a similar dance was held 
by what was then known as the S.ong 
Book Staff. This, however, will bo 
the first dance under the auspices or 
the newly formed Tri-Publication 
staff and is expected to bo a real 
campus event which will probably 
become an annual affair.
Feb. 19 Selected For 
Annual Junior Prom
The largest crowd in the history 
of the traditional Science Stag pro
nounced it the most successful smoker 
ever. Clever stunts, interspersed by 
pleasing music, together with inter
esting speeches and popular movies, 
not to mention the refreshments, con
tributed to the unparalelled program 
which amused over five hundred en
gineers and faculty members last 'Sat
urday night.
Original stunts, both humorouB and 
unique, presented by the four classes,, 
the faculty and the alumni; speeches, 
which were interesting and informa
tive and refreshments pleasing to the 
palate, united to make the 1925 Sci
ence Stag an event to be remembered 
by all who attended.
The Junior Class won the trophy 
for the best stunt by a musical com
edy take-off on Sciences favorite 
study (?) entitled The Campus of 
Karnegie. The judges had little dif
ficulty in choosing the Juniors as the 
winners of the traditional cup. The 
playlet presented by them was un
usually goodsuperior in many ways 
to any in former years. Although the 
stunts given by the Seniors and the 
Faculty were good they did not pos
sess the originality and cleverness so 
apparent in that of the Juniors.

* STUDENTS *
The annual Junior Prom has been 
postponed from Friday, January 29, 
to Friday, February 19, between the 
hours of nine until two. The William 
Penn hotel has again been selected 
to house the prom; negotiations for 
the ball room for January 29 failed, 
but the new date, as selected, found 
a vacancy on the hotel cards. After 
Christmas tickets will be on sale; 
the price, soon to be announced, is 
payable in Jhree installments, thus 
minimizing financial calamity.
Wally Lynch of the prom commit
tee, has opened negotiations with 
the Meyer-Davis orchestra, Ted 
Wees orchestra, and Jan Garbers 
aggregation. Ted Weems, it will be 
remembered, won recognition at the 
Junior Prom and the Soph Hop last 
season. Meyer-Davis and Jan Garber 
both of Victor dance record fame are 
well known in the east. The MeyerDavis orchestra, the favorite in Wash
ington, D. C., have made a name in 
Washington society.
The entire seventeenth floor of the 
William Penn, including the ball 
room, will be turned over to the prom 
committee, so that there will be 
ample room for everyone. Arrange
ments to cleverly but simply decorate 
the ball room have allowed the com
mittee to devote a large sum for im
proving the novel favors and the 
supper.
Just at midnight, following the 
promenade, supper will be served or 
four courses of delectables and frail 
foods tastefully prepared by the Will
iam Penns culinary connoisseurs. 
Too much emphasis cannot be placed 
on the annual prom; it occupies a 
place of prominence in the college 
social season.
SOPH TEA DANCE TOMORROW
LAST ONE BEFORE XMAS
A Sophomore Tea Dance will be 
held in the Union on Wednesday af
ternoon, December G, from 4:30 till 
6:00. This is the last tea dance be
fore the Christmas vacation and it is 
expected that a large group of stu
dents will be present. The popular 
Carnegians have been engaged for 
the afternoon. The customary charge 
of twenty-five cents will be made for 
men, with ladies admitted free.
TEARABLE PUPPET 
ON MARKET TODAY
Today will see the appearance 011 
the campus of Puppets novel num
ber, the Tissue Issue. The secret 
as to the details will be out at noon. 
Even more humor than usual Is said 
to characterize this issue and the 
Christmas spirit is present in abun
dance. This last fact makes it an 
appropriate gift to your friends.
The mailing of Puppets is greatly 
facilitated by the thoughtfulness of 
the Puppet staff who will send a 
Puppet to any address desired at a 
cost, of absolutely nothing. Instead 
of buying your issue and mailing It 
to your friend yourself, with quite a 
little inconvenionce and a cost of G 
cents for postage, have the Puppet 
staff mail it to your friend direct, 
sparing the trouble and expense.

Unheralded aiid with scarcely any 
of the student body aware of the fact, 
the Carnegie Musical Clubs, forty 
strong, went on a three-day trip last 
Wednesday, Thursday ana Friday. 
Butler, New Castle, and Erie were the 
towns in which the concerts were 
given.
It was a difficult undertaking for 
the musicians to present themselves 
to early in the season, but they per
formed very -creditably and showed 
that they had been carefully groomed 
by Directors Rebstock and Scalzo. In 
addition, the type of music sung and 
played was of the difficult sort, mak
ing the task- all the more harder.
Unfortunately, Director Scalzo 
could not make the trip, but his shoes 
were ably filled by Student Director 
Ralston. and the Instrumental Club 
under his guidance fell down only In 
a few minor matters of shading and 
attacks. The Glee Club had Direc
tor Rebstock wielding the baton on 
Wednesday and Thursday, while Al
lan Nern directed in Erie on Friday. 
The singers all in all did a rather fair 
job, but their enunciation is not what 
it should be.
. The individual numbers served to 
round out the program, and were well 
received in all the towns. Meredith 
Stump played his vioiin before very 
appreciative audiences, Wednesday 
and Thursday, and Ralston carried on 
the good work the following night. A 
special feature of the concert at New 
Castle was the appearance of Alice 
Nelson as a piano soloist. She played 
her numbers in excellent style and de
lighted the home town people. The 
Kiltie Quartet made a hit every night. 
These four young men are singing 
better at each appearance. A very 
original and clever interlude has been 
worked up by Dulin and Norbeck en
titled, Their Idea of an Opera In 
English. The audiences wanted more 
of these two. Allan Nern, the bari
tone from the music department Is 
with the Clubs again this year, and 
his vocal offerings heard in all three 
towns.
Of special importance was the read
ing of the resignation of George LeBaron as manager of the Clubs while 
the boys were on the train enroute 
from New Castle to Erie. Alfred 
Wingold. a Junior assistant manager

Christmas Carols to 
Feature Chapel Thur.
The chapel service Thursday noon, 
in the Arts Theater, will be in charge 
of .the Music Department, and In 
place of the regular program a num
ber of Christmas carols will be sung. 
This service will be conducted some
what along the lines of last year's 
pre-holiday chapel, when the entire 
program consisted of songs and carols 
and the special numbers were given 
by the Carnegie Glee Club and a 
picked chorus from the Music De
partment.
Thursdays program will include 
the well-known Adeste Fideles, 
Silent Night, God Rest You, Mer
ry Gentlemen, The First Nowell* 
It Came Upon The Midnight Clear" 
and Shepherds, 'Shake Off Your 
Drowsy Sleep. Besides these famil
iar carols, a selected chorus from the 
Music Department will sing a few of 
the older and less frequently heard 
French and English carols. There 
will be a contralto soloThe Christ 
Child, by Peter Cornelius, sung by 
Miss Kizzie Murdock, a student in 
the Voice Department. Matthew Frey 
will preside at the organ. The pro
gram Will be concluded by the Scrip
ture Reading and Prayer, with Dr. 
Baker presiding.
Dr. Baker is especially interested 
in this carol service, and he urges 
a large attendance of students and 
members of the faculty, to justify the 
great amount of work that those In 
charge have done on the program.

Pi Sigma Tau Calls 5 
M. M., Arts Women
Last week, at General Assembly, 
Pi Sigma Tau, the womens journal
istic fraternity, called five girls for 
membership.
The girls called wore: Charlotte
Durie, of the Department of Science 
at Margaret Morrison, who has work
ed 011 the Tri-Publications staff; 
Martha Eggers, also of tho Depart
ment of Science of Margaret Morri
son, member of the Tri-Publications 
and the Puppet staffs; Elizabeth Gor
don of the English Minor Depart
ment, who has worked on the Tartan 
and the-Shilling.; Betty Matter of the 
Music Department of the College of 
Fine Arts, who has worked on TriPublications and 011 the Shilling; and 
Alice Nelson, also of the Music De
partment and a member of Mortar
board, who lias Avdikod on the Shill
ing.
At this time Pi S'igma Tau also 
called as honorary members two 
members of tho faculty of the De
partment of English. Those were 
Mrs. Elizabeth Vermorcken and Miss 
Ethel Sponser.
PI Sigma Tau was organized by the 
Carnegie chapter of Pi Delta Epsilon 
in 1924. It was felt, at that time that 
the girls who had worked with tho 
men 011 the Carnogle publications 
and who had odi|.ed and managed the 
Shilling deserved recognition. Ac
cordingly girls are ehoson for PI 
S'igma Tau who have done meritor
ious work on publications. Hereto
fore there have beon two calls a 
year, one at Christmas and tho other 
011 Qualification Day. Tho call last 
Tuesday was the last mid-year call 
and Included only Senior because It 
was felt that Qualification Day was 
too late tc recognize them. At tho 
call during Campus Week In 1920 
Sophomoros and Juniors will bo 
pledged.

Six Engineers initiated By 
Theta Tau Last Saturday
Having successfully completed tho 
rough stuff" Initiation held two 
weeks ago, six men became members 
of Theta Tau last Saturday when the 
formal presentation of the pins was 
made.
The new members are:' J. E. Ward, 
Senior in Mining Engineering; D. G. 
Dalton, Junior in Meclulnical Engin
eering; D. M. Davidson, Junior Com
mercial Engineer; William Esciiet-, 
Junior in Commercial Engineering; 
J. F. Hotchkiss, Junior Civil Engin
eer and J. P. Fry, Junior Commercial 
Engineer. These men, . who were 
pledged at the last S'cience Assembly 
have been active in the campus af
fairs.
Theta Tau is an honorary profess
ional fraternity taking only men en
gaged in engineering work. The chap
ter at Carnegie is the outgrowth of 
a miners club formed when the Col
lege of Engineering was first organ
ized. In latter years men of other 
departments were accepted as mem
bers and in 1923 a charter was grantContinued on Page Three.)
Architects Sling Annual 
Smoker Saturday Night
Wow'! What a party! The archi
tects throw their annual smoker last 
Saturday nlte and It proved to be a 
most notable affair. The dean, the 
faculty, the alumni and the archi
tects were all there. The entertain
ment, the oals, and the smoker were 
the best obtainable.
The early part of the evening was 
spent listening to tho strains of the 
latest dance numbers and solos from 
a new orthophonlc Victrola secured 
for the occasion. Later In the eve
ning when the smoko had cleared 
away sufficiently, the entertainers 
took the boards.
The headliners were two dancerp 
and blues singers from the Nixon 
Cafe. How those blues did thrill, and 
the dancingas we have said, before,

told in their own pure way of several

A Student Welfare Fund has boon 
established with an Initial donation 
ol $5000, tho Interest, on this sum to 
bo usod In aiding students In finan
cial distress.
There are, every year, many wor
thy studonts who 'drop out of school 
or loso a year of school because of 
some unforseen omergoncy. such as 
sickness, accident or financial diffi
culty. These aro quite often students 
who deserve to remain In school, but 
because of these difficulties, are forc
ed to drop behind.
The facts above mentioned weighed 
upon tho mind of the donor of the 
initial fund with the result that Dr. 
Baker was presented with a check 
for $5000 to start a Student Welfare 
Fund in the hope that oCher contri
butions will be forthcoming to swell 
this generous amount. For reason 
best known to himself, the donor has 
thought best to conceal Ills name, 
but his gift is no less a worthy one, 
and one which it is hoped will con
tinue to be a part of the bevy of op
portunities offered to students who 
are deserving of financial aid.
The administration of the fund is 
under the jurisdiction of the Student 
Welfare Committee, of which Prof. 
Wurts is chairman, and which is .sub
ject to the approval of President 
Baker. The $5000 have already been 
safely invested and since the interest 
only is to be used, the principal will 
remain intact to keep up this source 
of aid to needy students.
The money will be used as gifts to 
the student, and not loans. In add
ition to helping stduents in distress, 
the fund will contribute in obtaining 
radios, books and flowers for the sick 
through the Y. M, C. A. Students 
who need tutoring, but who are un
able to pay for it will also be aided, 
provided they prove themselves wor
thy of such aid.
The fact that the return of the 
money' by the student Is not required 
is expected eventually to swell the 
fund. It. may be expected that a stu
dent who has received help while In 
school will later, when he Is better 
able, extend a helping hand to some 
other student In similar straits 
through this fund. In this way, good 
will Is extended and eventually any 
student in need of help will bo ablo 
to procure it.
The Student Welfaro CommHteo, 
under the able, leadership of Prof, 
Wurts, has been very active in pro
moting the general good of the stu
dents, and much has been accom
plished. Some of the topics now 
under consideration for the benefit 
(Continued on Page Three.)
Carnegie students have in store for 
them, on January S, 192G at the Car
negie Union, a social function of tre
mendous promiseThe Mlltary Ball.
The Military Ball is an innovation 
in the social life of Carnegie's stu
dent body. Never before has tho R. 
O. T. C. sponsored an affair of this 
kind at Carnegie. With the growing 
popularity of the Units at Carnegie, 
a plan was hit. upon by which the R. 
O. T. C. would enter Into the social 
life of the student body.
Officers or high rank from Pitts
burgh and vicinity will be in attend
ance and will give military atmos
phere to the ball. 'The Honorary Orllcors. moreover, thoso co-eds who 
are about to bo designated by tho 
battalion as Its favorites-will give 
a colorful atmosphere.
Although the dance* Is under tho 
auspices of R. O. T. C., every student 
of Carnegie is invited. One of tho 
prominent orchestras of the Campus 
will furnish the syncopations. Tho 
Union will be very decorative in a 
Military fashion. In fact, every pre
paration that Is being made tends to 
Insure that this Ball bo outstanding 
In the social life on tho Campus.
Tho price Is nominal, only $1.50. 
Tickets may bo obtained from tho 
Military Department, 229 Industries

Pins have beon definitely solocted 
as Senior distinction, by the Womons 
Senior Dross Committee. Mary 
Hughes is chairman of this committoe, which Is composed of Seniors 
from Margaret Morrison and Fine 
Arts.
The -pins or brooches, about tho 
size of a half-dollar, are in tho form 
of a hollow circle one-eighth of an 
Inch wide, to which an enameled 
thistle Is fastened. The flower is to 
be lavender and the leaves, green. 
The open-work feature will make the 
pin stand out more conspicuously by 
bringing into relief, the vividly-color
ed thistle. These pins will cost $1.50 
each.
The Margaret Morrison committee 
suggested brightly-colored silk scarfs, 
with a border of kilties. A vote or 
the joint committees, however, was 
in favor of pins. The scarfs, costing 
$2, were to be made by the Costume 
Economics Department and the profit 
was to go to the Costume Economics 
Scholarship Fund.
As yet, no plans have been made 
for selling the pins, but orders are 
to be taken soon after Christmas.

PROFESSIONAL; GAME 
AT ANNUAL BANQUET
The annual L'ootlmll banquet win* 
hold In tho ball room of the WlUbwiv.i 
Penn Hotel last Saturday afternoon... 
Head Coach Wally Steffen foaturedx 
the program with an address to t'littf 
assemblage of students, alumni, ath
letic officials, and meniborn of the 
past season's varsity and fresh moil 
football teams. Some of the high 
points of tho .Judge's talk are as fol
lows: "Men, tsop and think b of ora
you undortake to enter professional! 
football... ."It sturts the young main 
Just out of college In the wrong direc
tion; It loads him into tho paths oi 
least resistance, andi causes thei 
young athlete to lose respect for him
self. Professional football is noi ike 
same game as college football and 
nevor will be, for the simple reason 
that the one Is played for the Jove I 
the game and the other for tho love 
of money. Coach Steffen explained 
that he was not referring in any way 
to "Red Grange, and stated that tlie 
former Illinois star was an exception 
as he was making a fortune by play
ing professional ball, whereas the av
erage college athlete in pro circles 
gleans but a few hundred dollars a 
season. Wally, at this time then 
announced the 1926 football schedule 
which was greeted with cheers.
Given under the auspices of the 
varsity and Pittsburgh Clans, the ban
quet was a great success. Thomas E. 
Orr, president of the Pittsburgh Clan, 
was an excellent toastmaster, anfi 
with the aid of a very good program 
contributed much to the afternoons 
enjoyment. Samuel Harden -Churtdii 
and Dr. Baker made short speeches; 
in wlilcln they congratulated the teann 
and the coaches for tbs successful 
manner in which they had carried for
ward the athletic work of the institu
tion. Bob Waddell, assistant varaity 
coach: Jimmy Anderson, mentor off
the undefeated plebe team; Budfly-' 
overend, graduate manager; Dncer 
Beodo, this yoars captain, and f^tiycl 
Yoder, next years leader, aTI gave

"Childish Intelligence the stun, 
given by the Seniors was a skit on 
modern college youth removed to tho 
time when America was first settled. 
Tho stunt was easily one of the best 
and on ;i parallel to those given by 
the Seniors In former years.
The Faculty- stunt entitled A 
Bunch of Nuts was one of the clev
erest of the evening. The largo cast 
of faculty notables played their parts 
unusually well (?). The second part 
of the stunt, which although name
less, was equally as good as the ilrst. 
Tho Alumni stunt by Al MinettI of 
Tale of Woe fame was chuck full of 
laughs, and original humor.
Dr. nittman gave an Interesting talk 
on the Value of common sense and 
good judgment," delivered his usual 
forceful way. i
The stunts by the Sophomore and 
Freshman classes were not as good 
as in former years, due to a lack of 
preparation and interest. The 'Soph
omore Stunt was a take-off on a 
fraternity meeting entiled Gadunka 
Faugh Meets. The Freshman stunt 
was an effort, to depict the life of a 
student, It was called School Daze.
The winners of the popularity con
test proved as bashful as was ex
pected. However the prizes were 
fitting to each qualification and were 
guaranteed to fulfill all secret long
ings. The awards were as follows: 
Red OConnor, biggest bluffer; Joe 
Raddin, best politician; Buryi Hill, 
best dresser; S. Handley, hottest 
man in Science; John Illig, dumbest 
man in Science; Red Bender, best 
looking; Samuel Barley, most lady
like; "Jock Richards, best dancer; 
"Rosy Mason, popiest; L. E. Smith, 
laziest.
Programs and novelty cigarette 
holders were given away as favors. 
After the program was completed 
everyone proceeded to the Commons 
for refreshments. The silver cup was 
presented to the Juniors, after which 
all adjourned, happy in the knowl
edge that the Science Stag although 
over for this year would again be a 
reality in each succeeding term, to 
come.
The success .of the Stag was large
ly due to the earnest efforts of the 
committee, which was chairmanned 
by L. E. Smith. Tlie committee 1s in
debted to Etta Kappa Nu for the 
lighting effects; and to the Plebe Or
chestra for the excellent music arforded.
Several yiuirs ago the old Carnegie 
Band lost tholr blue uniforms and 
donned tho kilts, which aro truly rep
resentative of tho Carnegie, institute 
of Technology. Have you seen this 
picturesque band since they have 
adopted kilt's as their regulation at
tire...white tunics, with piald shawls
draped over tholr shoulders, plaid 
kilts, BARE KNEEJS,  rod woolen 
socks, and white spats? Have you 
seen the KiltiesIf not, here Is your 
opportunity.
At. the present time the Kilty Burnt 
Is planning to Invade tho east once 
again. Last year they gave concerts 
In several eastern cities, Philadel
phia, Now York and other places on 
tholr way east. They want to make 
another trip, and this time make It 
ovon a groat or success than tholr InIt 1.11 trip proved to bo.
Here Is what the Kilty Band offers 
In the way of entertainment; town 
parades or afternoon concerts to high 
schools and evening concerts by their 
forty-five piece band. In addition, 
twelve of the Kilties form a dance 
orchestra and will play for a dance 
after the concert by the Kilty Band. 
And In tills way an additional attrac
tion Is offered In raising the guaran
tee.
In order to make this trip, fifteen 
hundred dollars and lodging must 'be 
guaranteed. This Js the amount that 
will be needed for transportation and 
other incidentals to carry forty-five 
men. There Is no question but that 
the amount can bo raised easily In 
NIO concerts. Jt means that oa6h clan 
must make an average guarantee of 
two hundred and fifty dollars, and ar
range for places for the boys to stay 
overnight. The larger cities should 
guarantee three hundred to three
(Continued From Page One.)
Notre Dame will still remain to bo 
played in the order named.
The new teams added to the' sched
ule are Detroit, New York University, 
Juniata College and West Virginia 
University. Three of them are major 
teams, which when coupled to W. & 
J., Pitt and Notre Dame will present 
as hard a schedule as that of any 
school in this vicinity, which is simi
lar to saying as difficult as any in 
the entire country; for the schedules 
arranged by Pitt, West Virginia, and 
W. & J. contain more difficult teams 
than has been the rule in recent 
years.
All of the Tartans home gamesnext season be played at Forbes 
Field, the home of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the summer months. The 
home games will be with Thiel, Jun
iata, West Virginia and Notre Damo. 
Pitt will again be met In the stadium, 
and the game while played in Pitts
burgh will be considered Pitts home 
game. In tlie event of a clear day 
this classic of Western Pennsylvania 
will undoubtedly draw a capacity 
crowd.
A pleasing feature of the schedule 
is tho fact that with the arrangement 
of a contest between Carnegie and 
West Virginia a four-cornered rivalry 
will be created among the strongest 
grid machines of the Tri-State Dis
trict Should any one of the four go 
undefeated in this district, it would. 
unquestionably give that team tlie 
championship.

proud of the showing they made. 
While In Philadelphia they paraded 
down Market street and held the at
tention of twenty to thirty thousand 
people. These people did noLgazo at, 
them wlillo walking, but stopped and 
lined tho sidownlks from curb to

A questionnire settled many long

was quite surprising to note the gen

TUESDAY. DECEMBER 15, 1925THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
nlPat PHgluHaSc
Whos Who 
In Football
Dwight' Beetle.' Carnegies-1925 Var-. 
sity Football captain, has ably earned 
for himself a high position among the 
members of the Plaid athletic hall of 
fame. "Dikes story of progress un
der Coach Steffen is one of great In
terest.
Beede came to Carnegie in the fall 
of 1922 and played on the Plebe team. 
The following year, he was used as 
understudy to Doc Taylor for the 
center position. Last year he was 
shifted from the line and was de
veloped into one of Carnegies best 
plungng backs.
Beedes defense work has been out
standing. Tiime after time has Dike 
performed creditably in backing up 
the line.
It was Captain Eeedtf who helped 
place Carnegie on the football map, 
by making successful Wally Steffens 
spinner play. His 75-yard run against 
Pitt last year directly brought a vic
tory to the Tartans and provided the 
value of both Beede and the spin
ner.
Dike is a Junior on the Building 
Construction course of the Industries 
School. He is prominenC in campus 
activities. Dike was president of his 
class in his sophomore year. He is 
now the vice president of the student 
council. He is a member of the Kappa 
Skull, Dragon, and Alpha Tau honor
ary. His home is in Youngstown, 
Ohio, where he attended the South 
High School.
Allan Cass, a senior in the Printing 
department, has played guard on 
Carnegies fotoball team for the past 
three years.
Cass played on the 1922 Freshman 
team, holding down a tackle position. 
The year following he was developed 
into a guard. He proved to the coach
ing staff that he was of high calibre, 
and was quickly made a member of 
the varsity.
Allan has been playing consistent 
ball throughout his college football 
career. Although not flashy, he has 
always been a strong point in the line 
and a bulwark of the defense. Car
negie fans have never felt uneasy 
over the left guard position.
Cass Is a member of the Alpha Tau 
Omega fraternity, and Alpha Tau 
honorary. His home is in Ravenna, 
Neb.
Newton Cowan, the only sophomore 
to hold a regular varsity berth on the 
team, has been one of Coach Steffens 
most consistent players. "Nute has 
not as yet had an off day. His charg
ing and knack in opening holes for 
the Plaid backs has time after time 
brought words of praise to the former 
Lancaster High star.
CROSS COUNTRY LETTERS
The following men were awarded 
minor varsity letters for cross coun
try; Peck, captain; Himes, McNair.

THE 1926 FOOTBALL SCHEDULE 
Comments on the grid program for next season are now in order, 
and from all that can bo gathered there seems to be nothing but 
words of praise for "Buddy Overend's latest achievement. The cry 
for more major games has been heard and answered. Six of the 
nine bookings are distinctly of very high caliber, and in addition, 
the custom of leaving one of the mid-season dates permanently open 
has been abandoned. Two more or less definite peaks occur on the 
1926 card. The first includes the W. & J. and Pitt games which will 
find the Tartans at fhe height of their seasons enthusiasm, and the 
other comes with the West Virginia and Notre Dame contests when 
the team is at its best with regard to experience. Adrian, New York, 
andJuniata are new opponents for the Plaid and it is to be hoped 
that these games will be more successful than the experiments con
ducted with the past falls program. Carnegie followers will have 
the opportunity of witnessing with little effort all but two of the 
games; those with New York and Detroit. The only adverse criti
cism to be offered is that the team will not be forced to hit its stride 
until the middle of October and then at that time two of the hardest 
contests are played. Next fall should be a great success, and will 
undoubtedly be one if ineligibility does not cut too wide a swath.
WALLY STEFFEN
Although it is a bit hard to see why a young man who can turn a few 
hours of Saturday afternoon into a check for one hundred dollars is to be 
regarded as particularly unfortunate, it Is not hard to agree with Judge 
Steffen that the days of professional football are numbered, and approaching 
zero as a limit. Wallys stirring speech at the football banquet last week
end calls to mind some of the things he did a decade ago when he was 
considered one of Americas greatest all-around athletes. In prep school 
Steffen was considered little short of a phenomenon, and while attending the 
University of Chicago he won letters in track and football; at one time 
hojding the worlds records for the 40 and 60-yard low hurdles. In 1906 he 
won a place at halfback on the All-Western team, and the following year 
landed llie quarterback position on the same mythical eleven. In 190S his 
playing was so spectacular that Walter Camp picked him for quarter on 
his All-American team. Coach Alonzo Stagg of the University of Chicago, 
the Grand Old Man of football, has been quoted as saying: Two of tho
best players I have ever seen in action on any gridiron were Walter Steffen 
and Walter Eckersall. These two fellows made the act of running a kiekoff 
back to a touchdown look easy. Both of them could do it. and the 100-yard 
run which was made by Steffen back in 190S. when he was captain, defeating 
Wisconsin 18 to 12 for the championship, was the greatest I have ever -wit
nessed.
We have just reason to feel proud of Head Coach Steffen.

In the spring another call will be 
held at which time sophomores will

Plans for tho formation of a La
crosse team at Carnegie aro rapidly 
nearing completion. Graduate Manager Buddy Overend is arranging for 
the teams equipment and is looking 
for suitable grounds upon which the 
game may be played.
Nothing as yet can be stated as to 
the teams that will be schoduled, for 
the season does not begin until spring, 
with indoor practice in the fall and 
winter. Inasmuch as this is Carne
gies first year at the game only a 
light schedule will be adopted.
The idea is to develop varsity and 
wreshmen squads, members of the 
latter getting numerals for their ef
forts. There will also be inter-class 
teams, and a regular schedule will be 
followed by them. Besides the clubs 
in and around Pittsburgh that will 
be scheduled for the varsity and 
freshman teams, Johns Hopkins and 
Syracuse may be played.
The time for pVactice and black

will aid In coaching the team.
Lacrosse, which is replacing base
ball at Carnegie, has not been played 
around this section of the country 
lately; in fact, it is almost unknown 
to a majority of the students.
Tho game is played on a football 
field, twelvo moil to a team, with a 
solid rubber ball which is about as 
large as a basoball. Tho idea of tho 
came is to placo tho ball into tho not 
which is underneath the upright goal 
posts. Tlie net is six foot squaro. 
The players hit the ball with a stick 
which is similar to a tennis racket, 
except that: the wide part of tho stick 
is curved. Each goal counts one

PAGE FOURTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY. DECEMBER 15, 1925
i - utaH1aPl nPqu
THE PARTING OF THE WAYS
It is the traditional custom (hat in this last issiic of the year, tlie editor, after a few prelimin
ary pen scratching, wishes everyone a Merry 
Christmas and a Happy New Year. Never has 
this wish been so sincere, the greeting so heart
felt, but a note of sadness creeps in.
Sunday came the startling report of the death 
of Asbury Wilson and the 'writing of the Christ
mas editorial has been bereft of much of its pleas
ure. The sudden realization of the grim poverty 
of life brings us from tho realms ol! soaring ideal
ism to the bitterness but beauty of the earth. 
And so, in extending wishes for a joyous Yuletide, we experience a seriousness and earnestness 
that is unusual in view of the impending frivolity.
In the burst of laughter is hidden a little whim
per of pain. A newspaper headline is to many 
but a brief flash in the hubbub of life. Yet to a 
few it marks the beginning or end of a chapter in 
their unwritten diary. And a chapter has just 
been concluded in our diary, a chapter we may 
reread many times with pleasure only to be 
startled by its adrupt ending and the white space 
beyond.
Many of us knew of the exploits of Asbury 
Wilson. But we did not know of his ill health 
and sufferings,from an ulcerated stomach for six 
or seven years. Azzy was no coward. He 
fought grimly but the last doctors report left 
him no hopeso he just pushed matters a little.
Wilson was one of the most popular Seniors in 
the department of Civil Engineering, a member 
of the Sigma Nu fraternity and the Castle. The 
confidence of his fellow students was shown in 
his elation to 'the position of treasurer of the 
Carnegie chapter of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers. He enjoyed the respect of his 
instructors and of all with whom he came in con
tact. His caustic wit was softened by his quick 
sympathy which was easily aroused in defense of 
justice and square dealing.
His irreproachable character was invested with 
a touch of humanity that called forth the admira
tion and emulation of those who knew him. The 
loss of Asbury will be keenly felt. We regret 
that a life which promised such a wealth of serv
ice to his fellow men should be terminated at 
such an early age.
AND WHO WILL SAY THAT HE IS WRONG?
The policy of tho Tartan has been a continual 
source ot\ amazement to us. It tacks back and 
forth, once in the oyc of the wind and again it 
rides along as tho breezes blow, apparently seek
ing aimlessly for something that has been, lost or 
else is expected to appear from the waves like 
Aphrodite. In tho engineer and artist such a 
policy is to bo condemned. The narrower his 
path, the sooner and surer he will reach his des
tination and to falter may be fatal. But he deals 
with material means to achieve material ends.
Tho journalist has neither this fortuno or misrtunc, 11<* strives with ideas he forms and 
evystallizes the thoughts of men, and the edifices 
lie rears are often as grotesque and unlit for their 
purpose as the barn is to house the aesthete and 
the church to serve as a garage. Yet we iind 
1)0(1).
Tho journalists calling, howover, is a como,ial one and his editorials must bo in accord with 
the hard law of llie universe: Thou shall, not 
offend against the notions of thy subscribers. 
Tho Tartan, happily, does not labor under this 
handicap, Tho subscribers do not subscribe vol
untarily and they have as yet, few prejudices. 
And so the policy bobs back and forth on the 
seas of idle speculation; a delightful pastime.
The amusement seems such a harmless one yet 
to him who would avoid serious contemplation it 
is fraught with consequence. The reader swoops 
back and forth across -waves of black and deep 
emerald green. Flecks of glassy spray sting his 
face and the crisp tang of freshness bites his nos
trils. The sport is insidious. It carries him on.
As he looks on the gliding enameled surface 
beside him he sees first only the reflection of the 
sky and the clouds that hover dully overhead. 
But as his vision matures he discerns life and 
animation below. Over to the east he sees 
dolphins oppressing the merfolk; to the west the 
merfolk pursue the dolphins, all quite unconscious 
that they are mythical beings quarreling over 
mythical wrongs. They are so sincere, so earnest, 
so sure that each is right in his own endeavor that 
our erstwhile navigator leans over and asks the 
cause of their dissention.
I do not like, .says the dolphin, their table 
manners. They stir their .tea with their right 
hand.
We do not like, respond the merfolk, his 
table manners. He stirs his tea with his left 
hand.
And the dolphin oppresses the merfolk in the 
east and the merfolk pursue the dolphin in the 
west. And the navigator muses. Here, he de
cides is a parable.# # # # #
A group on the campus cries for a war memo
rial. A spokesman gives mouth to their demand 
by the words:
1 believe that a very largo percentage of Car
negie men and women fool that it is time to do 
something that will commemorate the memory of 
these men.
This he would achieve architecturally, vindicat
ing his plan by citing precedents. And who can 
deny that lie may be right?
Others maintain that the erection ol! a memorial 
is foolish and insulting to the very persons it 
makes a show of honoring. It. is soon forgotten, 
it becomes an object of curiosity rather than rospect, etc., etc.
Who shall decide which is right? If the stu
dents are interested let them write letters and the 
Tartan will big-heartedlv publish them. Let 
them appoint a committee on ways and means and 
they will obtain publicity. They will start a 
drive, they will persecute the editors of the Tar
tan, they will decorate coat lapels with pink pa
per tags, they will obtain their memorial and re
lapse with free consciences and the assurance of 
having done a good deed, all will applaud, and 
if the memorial be a sober tablet like that in
scribed to Elenora Duse in the College of Fine 
Arts it will be forgotten by all except the janitor

Dear Fellow Chrlstiuns:
I am writing you today because I bear that far 
away in Corinth and Ephesis there are men who 
are preaching false doctrines, men who are seek
ing to tear down our dogmas. Tliey would pervert 
our faith, and split tlie church, if they were but 
able. I hope you in Galetia have not been so ac
cursed, but I warn you, gentlemen, to stand fast in 
the faith if the modernists assail you. Why men, 
Christianity is true because it works. Its the best 
paying proposition in the world; I believe in it 
because it brings me real money dividends, and be
fore I go wandering into the hands of every newr 
cult of psychology or philosophy, I want to be 
shown that these religions are going to be the 
same sporting propositions that Christianity is, 
that they meet a man half-way. So I entreat you, 
brother, to beware of false doctrines.
While in prison I have much time to my own 
thoughts, and so I am working on some new ad
vertising schemes which will blaze the name of the 
Christian Church across the entire Roman world.
1 am convinced that the church, the greatest of 
living organizations, should bo put on tho same 
basis as other groat corporations. It pays in the 
long run. I shall communicate with you shortly In 
regard to this matter.
Yours for a Creator Church,
PAUL OF TARSUS.

. DWMT THEATER j
JUSTICE
"Justice" is a so-called thesis play, 
which means it was written to attack 
some faulty social condition, with the 
remote hope of reforming it. It Avas 
launched by John Galsworthy of the 
English judicial and. particularly, 
prison systems, and actually achieved 
the definite results of reducing the 
period of detention of prisoners be
fore trial, and abolishing the tlcketof-leave plan. Tills Is a remarkable 
thing for any play to do; and yet it 
is not, as Nathan says of Brieuxs 
"Accused, merely a lecture without 
the water-pitcher. Galsworthy stud
ied law in his youth, and, according 
to one story, threw a brick through 
a window in order to observe prison 
conditions at first band-. The result 
Is not only a powerful treatise, or an 
example of Galsworthys logical 
craftsmanship, but a play of life and 
reality as well.
The theme is given in the second 
act. Mon..are destroyed daily un
der our law for want of that human 
Insight which soos tliom as tbey are: 
patients, and not criminals. Tho 
four acts deal successively with tho 
detection of tiio crime that Falder, 
the unfortunate protagonist, com
mits; his trial and conviction; bis 
imprisonment; and Ills suicide to es
cape an Implacablo justice. Tho long, 
crowded court-room sceno Is lifted 
straight out of lifotho uninterestedjurists, tho weary jury, the business
like judge, tho Indifferent moving 
about of lawyoi'3 and witnesses, and
 the symbolic switching, on of tho desk 
lamps as the darkness grows.
In this act, too, is tlie eloquent 
plea of Frome, attorney for the de
fense (a young man, of course), giv
en by Hardle Albright in such a man
ner as to well deserve the applause 
accorded it. Following it, Cleaver, 
the prosecuting attorney, refutes his 
arguments drily and logically by 
meaus of simple circumstantial evi
dence, and thereby wins the case. In 
my mind, Falder should have been 
acquitted on the strength of Fromes 
inspired speech. Cleaver was either 
written or acted weakly. Herman 
Greenberg, somewhat too precise In 
his attempted technique, made him 
too eager; Walter Rogers went the 
other extreme and gave what has 
been described as an evangelical 
interpretation. Of course, Galsworthy 
is emphasizing the lack of emotion
al regard toward the 'prisoner, and 
probably meant Frome to offend the 
law-abiding jurymen with the radical 
nature of his views; but somehow
this fails to be quite convincing........
The judges fine speech, in summing 
up the evidence, gives the legal side 
of the argument, and almost equals 
Fromes plea in eloquence. F. Leon 
Ford made him an old, testy puritan 
of a legislator; Maxwell Slides ac
cented bis crabbiness and bocamc 
slightly oratorical.
In the third act is my idea of a 
perfect scene. After two premilinary 
ones introductory to the third, we 
soo Falder in bis cell at night. He 
paces up and down, trios to look out 
his high, barred window, tries to 
mend a shirt., paces again, picks up 
Ills basin and looks at It as if be 
wero suddenly unable to comprehend 
three dimensions. Ho drops it with 
a clatter. The corridor light flashes 
on, and prisoners in other cells an
swer his noise by banging on their 
iron doors. The racket Increases: it 
rises to a cresendo of mad,  futile 
pounding, until tho hopeless rhythm 
enters his brain and drives him in a 
frenzy to beat on his own door. And 
when the curtain t descends on the 
act the audience is left panting. Ells
worth Perrin, in this scene, is per
haps just as Galsworthy intended he 
should be; in fact, throughout the 
play he gives a straight-forward, sus
tained performance of the tragic 
weakling.
The two outstanding items of in
terest ir. the President's address to 
tho new Congress on Tuesday, the 
eighth of December, were in regard 
to the coal crisis and the World Court 
issues. The Chief Executive seems 
at last to have found himself and to 
have Btated bis premises in rather 
more definite way than has been the 
usual custom of this silent New Eng
lander.
As regards the coal -situation, he 
first states the Republican policy of 
"hands off in business, but then 
adds with quite some determination, 
The National Government at the 
present time has no authority to in
terveneauthority should be lodged 
with the President and the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor, giving 
them power to deal with an.emer
gencyauthority to call witnesses and 
to get documents, and in case of 
threatened scarcity exercise control 
over distribution!  This authority 
should have been granted some one 
or some board years ago, for it is not 
in accordance with our ideas of jus
tice that any industry be allowed to 
Lie up business and inconvenience 
the general public, because of selfish
ness and BtubborneES.
Mr, Coolldge reiterates again bis 
policy of the Harding-Hughes Court of 
International Justice but with the un
derstanding thatwe are not pro
posing to subject ourselves to any 
compulsary jurisdiction. If we sup
port the Court, we can never be 
obliged to submit any case which in
volves our interest for decision. Such 
a statement needs neither comment 
nor criticism. It is plain to see that 
any jurisdictional body, to which cases 
can "be brought at will; and whose de
cisions are not binding, has little 
place in the world of good common 
sense.
Mr. Coolidge has once again 
spoken, not wih : he words of a 
really greaL statesman that 'we wish 
he were, but with the voice of an 
honest God-fearing citizen. Will Dem
ocracy ever tolerate great leader
ship?

The lecture on Einsteins Restrict
ed Theory of Relativity which was 
given in the Carnegie Union on Dec
ember 9 by Vladimir Karapetoff, 
scientist and professor of electrical 
engineering at Cornell University, 
proved to be of unusual interest and 
attracted, one of the largest attend
ances of the year.
Professor Karapetoff was introduc
ed by Professor Work, head of the 
Carnegie Electrical Engineering De
partment, and then proceeded to out
line the method he intended to use 
In presenting his subject. He declar
ed that the ordinary explanations of 
relativity as given in popular maga
zines and writings confused rather 
than aided the public by tying up the 
theory with piactical applications, 
and instead of clarifying the basic 
principles, these attempts to connect 
relativity with everyday experience 
left the reader little wiser than be
fore. Professor Karapetoff therefore 
proposed to present the cold facts 
concerning the subject, and to explain 
these facts and principles from their 
scientific and theoretic basis instead 
of distorting them by attempting to 
give an interpretation through com
mon occurrences.
Professor Karapetoff first made a 
few elementary assumptions which 
he designated as the rules of the 
game, which must be followed 
througout just as rules in any ordin
ary game. With the aid of a series 
of charts, he developed his subject 
from one step to another, giving 
graphic illustrations of all the prin
ciples involved and drawing frequent 
similes which were apt and to the 
point. He also included in his lecturb 
several of his own discoveries ann 
theories which- he has not yet pub
lished.
Among other things, he dealt with
the relations of two systems and the 
units of measurement on these sys
tems as they appeared to two ob
servers in their respective systems, 
the relations between time and lin
ear measurement, and the muchabused and little understood "Fourth 
Dimension. The two systems men
tioned above were regarded as a new 
and independent world. Both were 
compared with various measurements 
when the systems were brought to
gether and again when they were set 
in motion. When the results before 
and after were compared, several 
peculiarities were noticed. By graph
ing these results on inclined axes, 
he showed that the value of the unit 
chosen had become less In the second 
case. As Professor Karapetoff said, 
When it is now here,' it is not now 
somewhere else. He also showed 
that two clocks on the systems were 
both late when measured' relatively, 
and that each observer lived only 
one year while his partner lived a 
thousand. It is impossible, however, 
to give even a very cursory sketch 
of the lecture on account of its 
graphic presentation.
Despite the difficult nature of his 
lecture, Professor Karapetoff sue- ' 
ceeded admirably in delivering his 
theories clearly and concisely. Thruout the entire lecture, his genial per
sonality and vivacity held the interest 
of the audience constant so that one 
felt relieved and refreshed after hear
ing him.
