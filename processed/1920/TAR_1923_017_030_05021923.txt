DISCUSSION OF 
SORORITIES FOR 
M. M. STUDENTS
Girls Inter-Dormitory Scooter Race 
To Rival Sweepstakes By Their Pace
Dean Brown Gives HerViews. 
Miss Breed, Director Mor
rison College, Favors Na
tionals
AROUSED INTEREST
Representatives of the three Arts 
College, Womens fraternities, Beetle, 
Alpha Kappa Psi and Beta Pi, are 
urging the M. M. girls to take favor
able action on' the question of per
mitting soroities in M. M. giving as 
their reasons various benefits to the 
school that would result, and show
ing that the Arts College soroities 
cannot become national untill all 
Carnegie girls are eligible for mem
bership.
It is thought by the girls that con
nections through fraternities would 
tend to break the barriers which 
.have existed between the girls of 
the two schools.
Sororities require high scholarship 
for membership and at the same time 
encourage activities. Most of the 
school publications complain of the 
lack of interest of the girls through 
sororities their ned for complaint 
would probably be swept away. Many 
other reasons are brought forth by 
the girls telling of the advantages of 
the sororities.
Miss Breed, director of M. M., is 
personally opposed to the entrance of 
sororities, although, as she says, she 
is perfectly willing to stand by any 
action that is taken, the whole ques
tion being a question for the Dean 
of Women and not for Miss Breed to 
act on.
Dean Brown's views are:
"The question of womens fraterni
ties, at Carnegie is one of the things 
that must be settled before many 
years are passed. There are at pres
ent in the College of Fine Arts three 
groups which are working together

Girls Prominent in 
Campu s W eek Activities
Bridge Party and Banquet 
Included in Schedule
For the first time since Campus 
Week was established as a tradition 
at Carnegie Tech, the girls are to take 
a major part in the program. With 
an energetic chairman in the person
age of Lillian Coleman, the girls have 
rallied, and the result is shown in the 
large number of events placed in 
prominent parts of the program.
Aside from the Girls S'weepstakes 
and the Coronation of the Queen, 
which have already been elaborated 
upon, the girls will put on a sketch 
at the Vaudeville Show. It has been 
written by Harry Hamilton and will 
be directed by Mary Brown. Marked 
Down is the title, and judging by the 
author is sure to be a hit. Harry Ham
ilton is yet to turn out a failure. The 
cast will be selected from Margaret 
Morrison and Arts.
Friday afternoon the girls will 
gather together for their annual ban
quet. This year, upsetting all prece
dents, it will be held in the Mens 
Carnegie Commons.
Saturday afternoon, while some are 
attending the show at the Schenley 
Theater, a garden party and bridge 
will be held on Mellon Hall lawn. On 
this day the girls ' will act as host
esses. .Tables will be set for five 
hundred and bridge. Prizes will be 
offered. Refreshments and amuse
ments will be' furnished.
The girls say this will be a good 
place to cool off from the exertions of 
running around to all the events 
which preceed.
ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS?
THISTLE BOARD ASKS ALL
ORGANIZATIONS PAY BILLS
There are still a dozen 01* so organ
izations which have not yet paid the 
bill for their pictures which are to apper in this years Thistle. Some of 
these have no doubt had a hard time 
to get the money together while oth
ers have just neglected the matter.
The Thistle Board has an immense 
lot of responsibility in getting this 
book out for the students and only 
one of them is the financial end. If 
only a few of the bills owing to the 
Board remain unpaid a lot of difficul
ties arise in paying the debts in
curred in the publishing of the book. 
This book is for the students and is 
a business proposition and should be 
looked upon as suchthey should pay 
their bills when due, just as in turn 
they expect to receive. However, it 
may be that the publishing of the 
names of these organizations not hav
ing paid their bills previous to the 
time that the book comes out might 
let them learn that co-operation, 
promptness and honesty are the best 
policies after all.
ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS?
Something original in the line of 
sweepstakes will be presented to the 
public by the girls of Carnegie on 
Friday of Campus Week. The main 
feature will be a scooter race be
tween the girls dormitories, but the 
race' itself is only one of several at
tractions. The requirements are that 
all participants be dressed in knick
ers, thus making the race doubly in
teresting from the viewpoint of a 
spectator.
Each team will be composed of two 
girls, one to take the scooter from 
the Central Building to the Skibo Inn, 
and the other to return it to the tap6 
at the Central Building.
A loving cup will be given to the 
team winning the race and an indi
vidual cup for the best costume. Sev
en teams are to be entered, one from 
each of the following dormitories: 
Forbes Hall, Forbes Annex, Mellon 
Hall, Mellon Annex, Upper Wood
lawn, Lower Woodlawn. A team will 
also be entered by the commuters.
This race promises to be one of the 
biggest features of Campus Week,

CARNEGIE CHEMISTS CLUB
HOLDS OPEN MEETING THURS.
The 'Carnegie Chemists Club held 
an open meeting Thursday evening, 
in (Science 218, which was well at

the manufacture of cork stoppers, and 
his talk was illustrated with samples

and cold molded plastics, he dis
cussed the subject from all angles and 
his hearers gained much new informa
tion.
The meeting was closed with a 
movie comedy and some refreshments.

CORONATION OF [All Plebes in Beggars Costumes 
CAMPUS QUEEN* Pverty Hits Carnegie Campus
THURS. MAY 24
Preliminary Election on May 
9 to Choose Three Girls to 
Appear on Final Ballot of 
Wednesday, May 16
MOVIES TO BE TAKEN
Coronation of the Queen of Campus 
Week will officially take place 011 
Thursday evening of Campus Week in 
the Open Air Theater. Immediately 
following the ceremony, dancing will 
be enjoyed by the Queen, her court, 
attendants, as well as the entire stu
dent body, alumni, and friends.
Preliminary elections to decide the 
lucky maidens to appear on the final 
ballot of May 16 will be held Wednes
day, May 9. The names of the fifteen 
who received the highest number of 
votes on the last election were auto
matically chosen as Maids of the 
Court.
It had originally been decided to 
hold the final elections on May 9, but 
due to the extra large number of beau
tiful girls selected in the nomina
tions of last week, and therefore the 
hard job students will have in select
ing which one will be best fitted for 
the position, the committee has de
cided to put the elections off just ex
actly one week. This will give each 
and every man a chance to boost the 
campaign for his favorite.
The Coronation program will open 
with several selections of classical 
dancing by a member of the drama 
department, followed by the entrance

Search-Light Rags Will 
Advertise Campus Week
Thanks to the genorosity of tho 
General Electric Company, Carnoglo 
Tech will have tho largest and most 
powerful . searchlight in the country 
to advertise Campus Week. This light 
has an intensity of eighty-eight mil
lion candle power. Some degree of 
comparison may bo obtained by say
ing that it is eleven times as bright 
as the ono which was used at Motor 
Square Garden during the Building 
Show. The beam from this light can 
be seen for two hundred miles If the 
weather conditions are favorable.
The light will be mounted on the 
top of Machinery Hall, which will re
semble the place for which it was de
signed, that is the towers of battle
ships, for this light is a war-time pro
duct of the General Electric. It will 
be used as the all seeing eye of Cam
pus Week. It is to be hoped that the 
Alumni will regard it as the Three. 
Wise Men regarded the Star, as a 
beacon guiding them back to their 
Alma Mater.
The lighting of the campus during 
Campus Week is always one of the 
most difficult and at the same time, 
one of the most important undertak
ings. It is necessary to find some 
means by -which the required amount

Annual Inter-Fraternity Races

Super-Features
O110 of tho most exciting events of 
Campus Week Is tho Inter-Fraternity 
sweepstakes. This ovent attracts 
widespread interest in that it is a real 
honost-to-goodnoss race. Of course 
tho cars aro only mako shift affairs 
and of 0110-man power but evon so 
there Is as much rivalry found In this 
race as at tho Indianapolis racos 011 
Decoration Day.
Somo of tho fratornltlos havo been 
Avorklng 011 their cars for months. 
There Is ono being constructed In tho

FIRST EVENT OF

Bill Includes Dummy Szold 
in Bed Room Farce, Stunts 
By M. M. Girls, and New 
Songs By Repplier
MALONEYS TO SING
Can you imagine Dummy Szold In 
a bedrom farce? Whether you can or 
whether you cannot is of 110 conse
quence, for he is to appear in 0110 at 
the Vaudeville Show, with which O.
B. Nowman will officially open Cam
pus Week, May 24, in tho Musia 
Hall.
Dummy lias written his little skit 
with a great deal of color, which I10 
has been ublo to add only through ex
periencing certain of tile events 
which take) place in the farce.
The Margarot Morrison girls ara 
preparing a stunt for the show, and 
it is rumored] that they are putting 
a lot of work into it with the hopo 
that it will bo the greatest thing of 
its kina ever staged. Naturally it 
will be, for anything tho M. M. girl3 
stage Is vastly different from any
thing that has ever been staged be
fore.
Ohio says ho is trying to keep 
most of the stunts under his hat, but 
tho trouble is that I10 keeps his hat 
at a fraternity house', and someone is 
always looking under it. Even with 
this snoak-thlef publicity, tho greatest 
feature of tho ALUMNI has not boen re
vealed, and It will remain a secret 
until tho curtain rises to disclose it 011 the 24 th.
Thosei of 11s who wore at tho show

Thoro Is a day fast approaching 
which Is tho most Important In the 
wholo year for tlio Plobos; tho day 
whon they step Into tho placo ot 
the Sophomores and I,alto up tlioir du
ties and responsibilities; It Is called 
Qualification Day."
All yoar tlio Plobos havo boon undor tho yolco ol! tho Sophomores, In 
training under various regulations 
tlmt aro almod to instill In tho Plobos 
tho spirit of loyalty to our school, respoct to those older In tho service of 
our Institution, and lovo for tho cus
tom of our Alma Mator, Sometimes 
these customs and regulations havo 
Boomod too much to ,bo borne and 
thoro havo boon uprisings and revolts, 
but they always ended In good spirit 
and friendship.
On this day tho Plobos will learn 
in tho ceremonies, which take tho 
form of a funeral, what it means to bo 
a Carnegie Clansman. At. tho time of 
tho funeral those black ties, socks, 
hats and armbands will be burled and 
be things of tho past, but still cher
ished In memories to think over and 
talk about in after years.
As tho Plebes march past the coffin 
they will lay therein their tribute to 
be burned on the funeral pyre and go 
on mourning the passing of a dear 
friend.
The symbol of the union of all class
es in the Clan is a chain with a link 
for each class; the Seniors link Is 
stamped with their numerals to mark 
their departure from the active Clan 
and the newest class will have its 
link forged onto the end of the chain; 
from then on this class will be an in
separable part of the Clan.
There is something behind this for
mality which has a deep meaning. As 
the chain can be stronger than its 
weakest link so the Clan can be no 
stronger than its weakest class.

CAMPUS WEEK
Prof. Kennedy Gives 
Review of Shilling
English Professor Believes Is
sue is Creditable Effort
'Will Carnegie celebrate Campus Week in 1924? The question is 
at present unanswered, but -when tho curtain falls on tho Fourth An
nual Campus Week, at midnight, Saturday, May 26, un answer will 
have been found to the question.
Upon the success of 1923 Campus Week depends the continuation 
of the setting aside of three days cacli spring when the students and 
alumni get together for a general good time.
One of the main reasons for the institution of Campus Week was 
to bring back Carnegie alumni as guests of the undergraduate student 
body. A few alumni have returned in the last two years, but the ma
jority have never witnessed a Campus Week and in order to assure a 
Campus Week in 1924-, alumni must make a greater effort to return 
to Dear Old Tech.
The undergraduate body also shares in the responsibility ot a 
successful Campus Week. They are hosts to Carnegie alumni and it 
is their duty to make it an enjoyable week. Tho pleasures of the 
week arc theirs to enjoy; tho responsibilities theirs to share. The 
student body by co-operation can make and must make May 23 to 
May 26 three days worth while and must make Campus Week in 
general a permanent institution and a tradition of the Carnegie cam
pus, as it really is.
Carnogio Tech was given nation-wide publicity through Campus 
Week last year and the press and motion pictures sprayed the name 
ol! tho school from coast to coast. This yoar, publicity will be aug
mented by the giant General Electric searchlight mounted on tho 
tower of Machinery Hall.
Campus Week is for tho good of Carnogio Tech; its hero to stay.
IS IT 7
THE SOPHOMORE-FRESHMAN SITUATION
Tho repent clash botwoon tho two lower classes was perhaps 
caused by a few mombrn's of tho Freshman class who thought that 
they were promoting class spirit. On tlio contrary these individuals 
were violating tho rules ol! the school in doilanco of tho Student 
Council, and aro liable to punishment to tho extent of being oxpollcd 
from school. Whatever action may be taken in this matter by tho 
.Student Council will bo endorsed by the administration.
What may bo a solution to this trouble is organized contests be 
twoon the Sophomores and Freshmen; such regulatod battles will per
haps determine the supremacy ol! the lower classmen without disrupt
ing classes and damaging school or public property.
This is something for the student governing body to think about 
very soon and got some action on this proposition beloro tho end ol! 
this school year so that next year these spasmodic outbursts will not 
occur.
A GRAVE DANGER
Last year a swimmer was drowned in the tank near Machinery 
Hall after being rendored unoonsoious by striking his head against a 
submerged iron pipo. That incident drew to the attention of the stu
dents and especially tho Sophomores of last year the danger involved 
in ducking Plebes in that tank and the practice ceased. The 
Plebes of last year are now Sophomores. They wore here when that 
unfortunate lad was drowned, when the grave danger was realized 
and when the practico of ducking ceased.
Evidently all that is past is forgotten. Will it bo necessary for 
the tank to claim another victim before the Sophomores realize their 
folly? Only last week a Plebe was thrown into the tank and he 
received a rather serious injury when his hip struck a submerged 
pipe.
A few thoughtless members of the Sophomore class are leadingthe remainder of the class to nothing short ofmurder. If the prac 
tice of tanking continues some member of the class of J26 will meet 
death at the hands of the Sophs, and nothing will atone for the crime 
that the Sophomore class will be held for.
Let the happenings of the past be a warning to the class of 25
and all classes that follow._______________________________________

Prof. Trinks Toastmaster 
At Tau Beta Pi Banquet
The faculty critic dealing with such 
a publication as The Shilling general
ly falls into ono of two errors: 
Either ho looks at the authors, porceives them to be comparatively im
mature, and wonders that they havo 
don so remarkably well; or he looks 
at tho groat world of letters, and mar
vels aloud that tho presumptuous 
young upstart-authors havo the te
merity to exist.
I'.', it not possible, I wonder, to find 
a correct position somewhere midway 
between these extremes? Can wo not 
assume as a starting point that tho 
Joseph Conrads and Wllla Cathors al
most never step, fit tho ago of one and 
twenty, full panlopJed from the brow 
of somebody-or-othor, and then re
member that tho human mind, accord
ing to tho psychologists, has attained 
its full moasure of intelligence beforo 
tho age of majority? Can wo not look 
at The Shilling as tho work of normal 
young people rather than as the pro
duct of over-developed precocities?
"Footsteps of Spring/' by Cecelia 
Schmidt, presents in rather attractive 
setting, a many times related story. 
Displaying at times a bit too much 
preciosity, tho story is yet well writ
ten. Parts of it aro done with a really 
beautiful style. Entirely different In 
Its tono Is tho sprightly narrative, 
"Tho Revolt of Claire, in which Doro
thea Wood sets forth the mishaps and 
reconciliation of a young married 
couple. Told almost entirely in dia
logue, tills story of a social problem 
might be termed tho work of a lighter 
Ibsen with a flair for happy endings. 
It is really a mere outline for a story. 
Ono misses a something In the char
acterization of the two actors which 
would make their actions appear more 
like real life and less like the author's 
working out of a problem.

of Impartially crlcicising poetry. I

judgment Is bound to be more Inter
esting than correct. Let me pass 
lightly over tho verse, the lines to a 
Young ArtistDead is my choice as 
the best poetical contribution. Par
ticularly do the last four lines appear 
to my sense of beauty. They deal 
delicately with a difficult subject, 
avoiding the twin pitfalls of sentimen
tality and morbidity. An intermis
sion, by Laura Provost, strikes me as 
a sincere attempt to distill beauty 
from modern life, more admirable in 
subject matter than form. The two 
contributions of Mr. Walter Leuba 
are Interesting.

Mrs. Miller Speaks 
To Women Voters
Exhibition of Model Balloting 
By P. C. W. Girls
At a meeting of the Fourteenth 
Ward League of Women Voters on 
Friday, April 27, tho women on the 
campus had a second opportunity to 
hear Mrs. Carrol Miller speak.
Mrs. Miller spoke at one of the M. 
M. Assemblies earlier in the year, 
where she was received with much 
enthusiasm. It is not surprising 
that quite a number of Arts and M. 
M. girls attended the meeting held 
in the M. M. Assembly Hall. Mrs. 
Miller recounted somo of her experi
ences while serving on the jury, plac
ing them in an amusing though al
most appalling light.
A discussion of the plans of the 
Stato League of Women Voters by 
a person prominent in league work 
followed. Model balloting, was ex
hibited in an entertaining manner by 
a group of girls from Pennsylvania 
College for Women.

WHY COME TO COLLEGE?
Why come to college?
What do you come to college for?
Did you come to learn to think 
constructively, clearly and concisely, 
or did you com to memorize the 
dogmas of your instructors and foiever afterwards, be ruled by their 
thoughts instead of your own?
These questions must some day be 
answered, not in words, perhaps, but 
Iby an individuals accomplishment 
and worth to his fellows.
How will you answer these ques
tions? Do you realize that only one 
student out of one hundred actually 
THINKS for himself? The other 
ninety and nine gather bits of infor
mation; assimilating- it, true, but fail
ing to take note of its significance, 
merely repeating it parrot fashion to 
certain sets of questions. When the 
general scope, of the course is cov
ered, the students accepts the state
ments of his professor as law; not to 
be questioned further. Therein lies 
the- danger. Students, in order to live 
up to their highest obligation, must 
question, must think, must ponder 
over the teachings of those who have 
gone before them and reason out the 
course which they should follow.
When professors, the president, or 
certain people closely related with 
the university make a reccor/iendation 
to the student executive committee, 
the fallacy of the present college ed
ucation stands out like candy on a 
childs face. Never once, to the 
knowlege of the Trojan, has any 
executive committee member opposed 
a thing which any faculty member 
has proposed or recommended. Cer
tain members are known to have 
made the statement that the faculty 
welfare committee had acted so and 
so upon certain questions, so what 
could they do?
That only indicates their weakness. 
The thing to do is what you actually 
believe is 'best, whether it corre
sponds with the judgment of those 
recommending it or not. The execu
tive committee, to mean anything to 
student government, must be some
thing .more than a pawn in the hands 
of the faculty, merely to be used as 
an instrument of student government 
but having none of the power! regu
lated to it.
In this respect the executive com
mittee is a concrete example of the 
results of modern education. How 
often do you stop to analyze a ques
tion, or, better yet, how often do you 
question the statements of others 
and reason out the truth of its appli
cation? Do you not, quite frequently 
expound a certain theory you got out 
of books, trying vainly, to make it 
cover a multitude of problems, when 
just a little clear thinking would 
show a wrong application .of a good 
thought?
Plonestly, now, what did you come 
to college for?
Your action in- life from now on 
will be the only conclusive answer.

Graphica Will Have Feed 
At the Bird Cage, Friday
A Graphica Swallowing Bee will be 
held at the Bird Cage Tea Room next 
Friday evening at six o'clock. Tha 
banquet will be in the form of a 
pep-arou3er featured by home talent 
and the absence of any long-winded 
Speaker. Tho completion of the trip 
book will also be celebrated.
After a year of hard work on the 
book which is an acount of the in
spection trip taken by the Graphica 
last Easter, it has ben decided to 
commemorate the event with a gettogether dinner. A Printing Depart
ment Orchestra has been formed for 
the occasion and will furnish music 
at odd moments throughout the even
ing. A few parodies on some mem
ber of the club have ben prepared 
and will be sung by the Swallowers.
Other stunts of a varied nature ar 
being prepared to make the evening 
a real printers occasion. The Bird 
Cage Tea Room is located at 6025 
Penn avenue in East Liberty. The 
committee in charge of the banquet 
consists of Einar Rygg, chairman;

CAMPUS WEEK MUSIC 
REVUE ON FRI. MAY 25
Girlschorus girls in fantastical 
costumes dressed to please the eye, 
and voices that throw their musical 
oscillations out over the enthralled 
audience; plus sheiks, with vasalined 
hair, that resemble a drowned mouse, 
all backed up by big-horns, tubas, vio
lins, cellos, saxos, drum, et cetera 
whats it all moanin?
Pure and simple; it is the Musical 
Box Revue at the Music Hall on Fri
day of Campus Week.
All of the song-birds of all of the 
musical organizations on the Car
negie Tech campus will be present, 
and as a result, entertainment of the 
super quality a la musical will be 
presented for the enjoyment of the 
thousands of students, alumni, and 
friends who gather in the Music Hall 
for the occasion.
Friend Turcotte has promised that 
the fest or Revue will be just that 
too. In New York, they call the show 
at the Winter Garden a Revue. It 
is not the purpose of the committee 
on this function to try and show th 
Winter Garden of "Lil Ole New York 
what a revue should be like. In
stead, they are going to take their 
word for it, and put on a show that 
will rival Bert Swor, Al Jolson and 
his company of beauties.

CARNEGIE TRACK TEAM WINS 
MILE RELAY AGAINST STRONG 
COMPETITION AT PENN RELAYS
Gare, Cooper, Brumbaugh 
and Szold Outdistance Field 
in Fast Race. Rensselaer 
Most Dangerous Opponent
MILE RUN IN 3:32
The fame of Carnegie Tecli was 
spread far and! wide wlieu her speedy 
relay team defeated the runners of 
the best technical schols in the country at the Penn relays last Saturday. 
In doing this, she hung up1 one of the 
/best marks made in the carnival; the 
Skibos' time was three minutes and 
thirty-two seconds, an average of 53 
seconds per quarter. Gare, Cooper, 
Brumbaugh and Szold were the run
ners who brought victory to Car
negie.
The Tartans were entered against 
a select field of technical schools, but 
at the outset of the raco it was evi
dent that the team to be most feared 
was that of Remiselaer. It was 
through fast runinng tty Brummy and 
Szold in the last two quarters that 
the boys from Troy were finally dis
tanced.
Gare got off to a good start, and 
Cooper took over the burden at the 
end of the first quarter-miie. Cooper 
passed the baton to Brummy. When 
Dummy Szold took over the race for 
the final stretch he was slightly be
hind the Rensselaer man. But by 
tearing off a briiiant final quarter, 
the Plaid runner passed his rival and 
won with several yards to spare.
Dykeraan lan the two-mile course 
the day before, and same in 
sixth. Pittman and Robertson, the 
two representatives who invaded the 
West with the purpose of garnering 
a little glory at the Drake relays, 
were forced to return without having 
placed in their event, the broad jump.

GIRLS WILL COMPETE 
IN TENNIS AND TRACK
Tennis and track competition 
among the girls will be a feature of 
the 1923 Campus Week celebration. 
Committees are at work on plans for 
a tennis tournament and an InterClass track meet, and also for a girls 
sweepstakes to be similar in nature 
to the Inter-Fraternity Sweepstakes.
The tennis will probably be started 
this week. Miss Gertrue Lyons is 
the chairman of the committee in 
charge and is now arranging with 
Miss Bowman for a tournament. The 
preliminaries will be played off be
fore Campus Week and the finals will 
be played at a scheduled time during 
that celebration.
Little has been worked out in con
nection with the track meet as yet, 
but it is understood that each of the 
classes in the Margaret Morrison Col
lege are organizing teams to compete 
in the meet. Miss Helen McCrum is 
in general charge of girls athletics 
for Campus Week and is working 
with Miss Bowman in making the pre
liminary plans.
The Sweepstakes will be between 
dormitories and will be run in relays, 
with scooters as the vehicles of trans
portation. There will be a trophy for 
the speediest and one for the best 
costumed lass. Miss Mary Heilig is 
in charge of the Sweepstakes.
Trophies will also be awarded the 
winners of the tennis and track com
petitions.

SCARAB ARCHITECTURAL
FRATERNITY CONVENES
(Continued From Page One.)
The most important work of the 
body was the arranging for the con
tinuance of the Scarab competitions 
and exhibition. Each year a national 
competition is held for the schools 
in which chapters are located in 
which a prize is offered to all arch
itectural students enrolled in the 
Beaux Arts Institute of Design. An 
exhibition of sketches from the arch
itectural schools of the fraternity is 
held annually so as to encourago 
sketching.
The convention elosed with a bauquent. The speakers were Louis Sul
livan and Mr. Garden, both well 
known architects of Chicago. E. E. 
Valentine of the University of Illi
nois, was chosen to head the organi
zation next year, succeeding Clemens 
Nicholas of Washington University.

On the Plaid Screen1 Inter-Frat Athletes 
Train For Finish
By H. H. WILSON
VICTORS AGAIN
Two years in succession have the Tartan colors been carried to victory 
in the Perni Relays at Philadelphia. Last year a special class for technical 
schools was created and both years have seen a Plaid runner the first to 
break the tape for the one-mile technical school relay championship.
The time this year was quite fast, being better than that of several of 
the other college class relays. The average time for each man was about 53 
seconds for the quarter mile.
Evidently Coach Beeler, in spite of being handicapped by the ineligibil
ity of some of his best men, has developed what material he has available 
to a high degree.
At the Drake Relays, Pittman and Jimmie Robertson failed to make 
places in the broad jump but that is not to their discredit for they were up 
against some crack men from the western conference schools. They will 
undoubtedly make a much better showing in the meets in the Tri-State sec
tion.
AN OPPORTUNITY
To entertain and to show Carnegie Tech to a host of high school and 
prep school athletes will be given the student body next Saturday when they 
compete in the Seventh Annual Interscholastic Track Meet on Tech Field.
The entries this year have greatly exceeded those of former years and 
judging from the caliber of some of the schools entered the competition is 
going to be of the best.
And now fellow students, get on your toes, make these fellows feel at 
home.
Old Jupe Pluvius took another turn out of the Tartan net men last Sat
urday when he stepped in and called off the match with the W. & J. racqueteers.
The Y. M. C. A. should come in for a word of praise in connection with 
the Inter-Fraternity Dormitory Basket Ball League during the season just 
past. The league was conducted under the guidance of the "Y and received 
considerable financial aid from that organization. Next year the "YV hopes 
to take even greater interest in this activity and make it a bigger success 
than it was this year. This is just one of the numerous activities which the 
Y. M. C. A. is taking in its steady expansion on the campus.
The officers and members of the schedule committee of the league have 
also worked efficiently and earnestly in their efforts to make the season the 
best that it was possible to make it. They are deserving of credit for work 
in an activity which offers no recognition in the way of insignia or otherwise.
Football practice is still in vogue but Doc and A1 refuse to give out any 
inside dope on how the men are showing up. They are well pleased with the 
material that is out for the daily scrimmages and are looking over the men 
with a critical eye.
Were presenting herewith our selection of an All-Fraternity Dormitory 
basket ball team. It is rather of a difficult task to pick out the stars from 
the number of good players who participated in the league games, but here 
goes:
First Team.. Second Team.

The first home varsity tennis 
match, scheduled with W. & J. for 
last Saturday, would have required 
boats for court navigation had the 
contest been played. That match 
has been postponed, but today is the 
beginning of a series of four consec
utive matches, ending Saturday.
This afternoon at 3 p. m., the West 
Virginia Mountaineer netmen will ap
pear on the Carnegie courts for their 
return matchafter having made 
creditable showing against Pitt yes
terday. Two weeks ago the West 
Virginia boys held the Plaid racqueters to a 3-3 match at Morgan
town.
Tomorrow Captain Connie Schwartz 
and his five-man playing team will 
motor to Washington, Pa., to en
counter Coach Dickeys stubborn 
W.-J. wieiders to see who can 
weather the engagement with the 
greatest opposition. Back in 1919, 
W.-J. had the edge on the Plaid boys 
by tying tlio first match and win
ning the return one 4.2. Only once 
since then, when Garbisch was the 
mainstay for the Presidents did they 
tie the score, but that is not saying 
what can happen.
Oberlin College claims a crack net 
team which it is sending to Smoky 
City to cleanup on Pitt and Carnegie 
Tech. This team may cause the 
Skibo racquetmen considerable trou
ble, so Coach Garland has put his 
men through some real net punish
ment, administered by himself and 
another exceptionally accomplished 
tennis champion of this section of 
the country. The Oberlin match will 
be played on the Carnegie courts at 
3 p. m., Friday of this week.

and one driver. Track men are not 
eligible to bo pushers, due to the re
quest of Coach Beeler. Ho believes 
it would harm them to run over the 
stone roads. This will not have the 
least effect upon the raco as far as 
excitment is concerned, in fact it 
should add to it, for the runners will 
be more evenly matched, thus insur
ing a close finish.
Last year the judges and contest
ants were considerably annoyed, and 
evon handicapped by spectators 
rushing onto tho course. This was 
especially true at tho -finish. The 
judges were unable to decide upon 
the winner and as a result two cups 
had to be awarded. In order to pre
vent a repetition of this deplorable 
condition the committee lias made tho 
stringent rule, that any person plac
ing himself upon any part of tho 
course while tho race is being run, 
shall cause the fraternity, to which 
ho belongs, to bo disqualified as a 
contender in the race. It is an abso
lute necessity that the track bo kept 
clear.

Features Will Be Field Events, 
Sweepstakes and Relays
Sincai tho dual meet with Navy at 
Annapolis scheduled for Saturday. 
May 26, has been cancelled by Tartan 
officials, interest will center in the 
inter-fraternity relays and field events 
to bo held in the C-arnegle bowl on 
that day. Tlieso events will be, along 
with the annual sweep-stakes, tho 
main athletic features for Campus 
Week.
Most of the fraternities and dormi
tories entered in the relay nice are 
getting down to real work preparing 
for this highly interesting event. 
Their athletes began training in earn
est Monday evening of this week, and 
indications are that there is going to 
be some stiff competition when May 
26 rolls around. The cup to be given 
the winner of the relay raco by 
Coach Paul Beeler is a beauty, and 
is well-worth trying for. The out
come of tho relay race wil also have 
a decided bearing on the entire met, 
inasmuch as this race will count dou
ble points toward the Theta Tau Cup.
The other events to be held on 
this day aro the shot-put, javelin 
throw, discus throw and the pole 
vault. Quite a few huskies have been 
working on the weight events for 
some time, and some good marks aro 
expected. Everything is also in read
iness for the pole vault event, a pit 
modern in every respect having been 
constructed by the track managers 
and some hustling Plebos. This will 
enable all candidates for tho polo 
vault event to get all tho practice 
they desire. Nothing is being left 
undone to have the contestants in the 
best of condition for tho final events 
in tho inter-fraternity dormitory 
meets. There is almost a month left 
In' which to prepare for this moot and 
those men who come out now will 
benefit greatly.

VAUDEVILLE FIRST EVENT
OF CAMPUS WEEK
Dorm. Leagues Flash 
Clever Basketball
Larger Attendance Marks 
Closing of Season
The Inter-Fraternity Basket ball 
season was a groat success this year. 
Tho games were all hotly contostod 
and tho attendance was largor than 
oyer boforo. Also thoro was a display 
of hotter basket ball than has boon 
exhibited in tho past by tho frater
nities and dormitories.
As probably ovoryono knows, tho 
fraternities and dormitories aro di
vided Into throo leagues. In tho early 
part of the soason tho toams In tho 
several loagues play games to docldo 
tho champion of tho loaguo. Sigma 
Nu, Iota Sigma Delta and XI Sigma 
Upsilon won tho championships of 
their respective leagues. Tho gamos 
In tho loaguos woro very fast and with 
a few exceptions woro worth while 
watching.
Tho championship serlos was sched
uled for tho month after tho Eastor 
vacation. Tho first gamo was be* 
tweon Iota Sigma Delta and XI Sigma 
Upsilon. Iota Sigma Dolta won this 
game by a Bafo margin. In tho noxt 
game Sigma Nu played tho XI SIgs 
and also won by a largo number of 
points. On Saturday, April 14, tho 
two conquerors met. It was indeed a 
gory battle.
The men tackled each other and 
made it look more like a football 
game than a basket ball gamo. Finally 
after the terrific scrimage Sigma Nu 
came forth the victor. In tho follow
ing week Sigma Nu again played tho 
Iota Sigs and decisively defeated 
them for the second time. Thus Sig
ma Nu won the championship.
The basketball season this year 
served to bring into better relations 
the various fraternities and did much 
good in fostering embryonic athletes. 
This was possible because of the 
good spirit with which all contests 
were played.

N. Thompson, Vana and Burgis 
were tied for fifth place, all having 
scored 98.
The Carnegie Tech Rifle Club tourn
ament will begin Thursday of this 
week and end on Friday, May 11.
The range is located on the fourth 
floor of tile Arts Building and any 
student at Tech is eligible to com
pete for the gold and silver medals 
to be awarded the highest scores in 
the prone and standing positions. The 
range will be open on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays and Fridays at 4:30.
MASKED WONDER WILL
APPEAR AT Y SMOKER
(Continued From Page One) 
senting to meet the Wonder In battle.
Another attraction will be the bout 
between Battling Hogan and Cyclone 
Hoenniger. It is called a Country
side Match, but is understood to be a 
big town event.
There will be serious numbers on 
the program also; but none the less 
interesting because they are serious. 
Dr. Baker will give a short talk on a 
subject which has not been announced 
yet. C. F. Bowers, T. N. Griggs, and 
A. C. (Al) Irwin will be included in 
the speakers list.
While the smoker is being held un
der the auspices of the Y. M. C. A., it 
is not restricted to Y members. It is 
hoped that the entire male student 
body will be present to help make a 
pleasing impression upon the visit
ing school boys, many of whom will 
remain in town during the evening.
The committee, composed of Cy 
Hoenniger, E. C. Fraizer, and Ray Gill, 
promises that the affair will be short 
and snappy.

IT was the first question in the course on Shav

and the student replied,  Because it cant get lost. 
He referred, of course, to the Williams 
Hinged Cap which you see pictured here. This 
invention puts an end for all time to the nuis
ance of hunting for lost caps. As you see, the 
Williams cap is hinged on. Its the only col

CALL OF FOURTH 
CAMPUS WEEK
YOUNGETOWN CLAN
Memories of the Mardi Gras, 
Circus and Sweepstakes, 
Will Bring Back About 
Fifteen Hundred Classmen
GOOD TIME CERTAIN
In the spring of 1920, the students 
acting under the impulse of a desire 
to become better acquainted with the 
Alumni of Carnegie ana to revive 
Alumni interest in Carnegie, appoint
ed a committee to draw up plans for 
some kind of Alumni Old Home 
Week. This committee, after much 
work, Anally drew up plans for the 
first Campus Week which was held 
May 13, 14, 15. Let it be known here 
that all of the old timers who came 
back for this first celebration have 
not missed one since. Will you who 
are in this fortunate group ever for
get the first Inter-Fraternity Sweep
stakes, the chase of the greased pig, 
the Senior-Faculty game with Bill 
Pfouts on the mound for the Faculty, 
the V arsity-Alumni game with 
Fuzzy Eyman the "Bulgarian Um
pire, officiating, and a hundred other 
incidents. Then there were Billy 
iSands, Dick Horton, Shaubie, and the 
rest of the prodigals raisingwell, 
worse than that, all of the time.
And what about the circus! The 
greatest show on earth! Jazzaro 
Brothers, the Eight Piece Negro 
Band, the gigantic battle between the 
ships Hells Terror and U. S. S. 
Science, Beans, The Snake Eater, 
Kate and Dupiikate, Ferro, the IronSkin Man, The Wild Man, Craig, the 
Master Mind, and all of the rest of 
the Side Show Freaks. It was a cele
bration which will never be forgotten, 
and marks the turning point in Car
negie Techs Alumni-Student affairs. 
Traditions were started which we 
should allow never to be forgotten or 
neglected.
The second annual Campus Week, 
held May 12, 13, 14, of 1921. started 
off with a bang. The vaudeville show 
was a decided success. And the pa
rade! Yea, verily some Pee-rade with 
float n everything. There were tho 
usual baseball games, athletic events 
and ceremonies, including the burial 
of Old Man P. R., and Tap Day Exer
cises, and of course the Sweepstakes 
again, better than ever and what a 
race it was. (Who can ever forget 
that first turn?) Again we had Sands, 
Shaubie, Red Merrill, Exline, Cowan, 
and all of the one hundred other outof-towners.
Friday night the stage was set for 
something newThe Mardi Grns. The 
entire street in front of tho Central 
Building was beautifully decorated as 
a Court of Honor with thousands of 
colored lights. Never was such a 
party held on the Campus. Everyone 
of about eight hundred in costume, 
Mexican Bull-fighters, Dago Organgrinders, Spaniards, Orientals, clowns 
and what not, all on masse. Oh what 
a night! (Saturday morning found 
everybody resting after tho Mardi 
Gras. The events of the day included 
athletic events and the best May 
Dance ever held on the campus. In 
the evening came the Circus.
The athletic field was illuminated 
with many high-powered search lights. 
We hardly know where to start, be
cause if you missed it, the less said 
the better. The Side Show freaks 
were better than ever. Never has 
such a crowd witnessed an event on 
Tech field. From the opening parade 
to the chariot race it was a howling 
success. Even Dutch Ivrieder and Tillie enjoyed it. Everybody left, feeling 
that it was the best event ever 
scheduled and making plans for the 
third Campus WeekBIGGER AND 
BETTER EVERY YEAR.
Again the Vaudeville Show opened 
the program, at the Campus Week of 
May 25, 26, 27, of 1922. There were 
the stars of the campus on the pro
gram. Adelaide Zeil as the Spirit of 
Campus Week was a decided hit. 
Obie Newman and Snyder jazed it 
up a bit, and there was dancing by 
Ned Jennings, Peg Harman, and Lot
tie Swain. Paquin put on a scream in 
one act entitled In the Movies Words 
Mean Nothing. No one can forget 
the Hick Quartet, Repplier, Hertz, 
Reid, and Szold with their hick song 
Stranger, Stranger. And oh! Red 
Godden, Chet Brumbaugh, Cy Com
fort, Doc Taylor, Jimmie Anderson 
and Obie Newman in the skit Tiie 
Fatal Necklace.
Old Man P. R. was buried 
schedule as taps were sounded. And 
you should have seen the Court of 
Honor in front of Central Building. 
The ICrazy Kat was very much in evi
dence. We had the honor of having 
Will Hay3, the King of- the Movies 
with us for an address. The Mardi 
Gras, Federation Banquet, and Rennys Place, need no comment. No 
one with good sense missed them, 
and then we almost forgot our own 
queen of the Mardi Gras, Miss Joseph
ine Whitney, The coronation cere
mony was the spectacle of the year.
Wally Steffen came all the way 
from Chicago to be with us, and Bill 
Reilly from Los Angeles. How far 
are you coming this year? Arrange
ments are on foot to give a cup or 
prize to the man or woman who comes 
the farthest or oftenest or something 
to tlii3 years Campus Week. We 
must have fifteen hundred Alumni 
back. You cant afford to miss it. The 
program is complete. Come out and 
show a loyal student body that you 
know how to appreciate hospitality 
and hard work. Write the Alumni

decidedly glad to have him with us. 
After tho dinner and a snort business

Dr. Bakers talk was concerned 
with the activities and policies of the

ARE YOU SUPERSTITIOUS?
DISCUSSION OF SORGITI ES
FOR M. M. STUDENTS
(Continued from Page One) 
under the direction of the Intersoror
ity Council. Shall they or shall they 
not draw their membership from all 
Carnegie women? if they wish to 
become national, they! must.
The answer to this question in
volves a discussion of advantages 
and disadvantages In tlie womens 
fraternity system. The advantages as 
I see them aro, first, that the fra
ternity gives to its members cortaln 
standards, and ideals which sot them 
thinking and in some cases aro rules 
for life. Secondmembership means 
a group of friends some of whom are 
close and companionable. Thirdtho 
fraternity Insists on a high standard 
of scholarship and participation in 
student activities. Fourthafter col
lege, there is usually pleasure from 
meeting members from other chap
ters of your fraternity.
"The disadvantages are: First1 
that membership is selective and ex
cludes the maojrity of' the women. 
Secondthe members are criticized 
because they arrogate to themselves 
importance and frequently come far 
short of justifying their claims by 
not living up to their ideals. Third 
they increase the expense of a col
lege education. Fourththe basis 
for qualifying for membership is fre
quently superficial.
"If we should have women's nation
al fraternities at the Carnegie there 
are certain very specific requirements 
which would be made, among which 
are:
"1. That none but the best of the 
womens nationals be petitioned.
"2. That there be no. fraternity 
houses, because of the expense, the 
difficulty of getting houses near the 
campus, and the greater desirability; 
of a dormitory system for out-of-town 
girls.
3. That .here be no Freshmen 
pledging because a Freshman should 
not be judged on her high school 
record, family, friends or looks, but 
on what she has proved herself to be 
in college.
4. That upperclassmen be taken 
in.
5. That a good average in schol
arship be made to qualify for mem
bership.
6. That not less than a certain 
proportion of the membership be 
from each college.
A woman's fraternity system such 
as this would, I believe, be based 
on the worth of the girl herself ex
clusive of what she was born to, and 
would interest the Freshman from a 
fundamental rather than superficial 
point of view, and would tend to lead 
the way to interest in activities and 
accomplishment in them.

The Song Book is coming!!! So 
are the Campbells and Xmas! Some 
time ago there was some Inherent agi
tation among the students, faculty, 
poets, musicians, and those interest
ed about the publication of a Song 
Book in which the songs of Carnegie 
Tech would be collected. This was a 
good idea, and so far, that is all It 
has amountod to. Reports were made 
public in which the famous volume 
of popular anthems was said to be 
all but out. Now wo think it is out 
out of existence.
A second report told the anxious 
students that it would come along 
with tho advent of the now year. A 
sort of greeting! Well, that was 
amended, and it was made to road 
bo out with tho now semester. Alas, 
the now semester has como and Is 
wasting Itself away and still thoro Is 
no Song Book.
Now, with this little bit of Introduc
tion, wo will go on with tho story. 
You see thoro has beon nothing but 
a story about a Song Book all along, 
and it is now about to turn into a 
fable which will have this for a moral:
