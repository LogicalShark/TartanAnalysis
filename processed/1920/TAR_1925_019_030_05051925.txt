Ticket sale for "Collegiately Speak
ing, the Campus Week show, will 
open today, Tuesday, and continue to
morrow on the cut, at 11:30. This 
will be the first opportunity for those 
students who have not ordered 
-through their fraternities or dormi
tories to secure seats, and prepara
tions are made for a big rush.
Already, from the fraternity orders 
alone, over one thousand seats have 
been taken, with some of the frater
nities yet to be heard from. It looks 
as -though there will be nothing but 
standing room left by the night of 
the show. If necessary, the commit
tee will sell the seats around the 
sides of the Mosque, but this will not 
he done until all the other seats have 
"been soldAt present, practically all the 
$1.75 seats are gone, and those who 
want the best remaining seats had 
best be well up front in the line when 
the sale opens on t.he Campus today. 
This sale will be closed Wednesday 
at 1:30 if possible, and after that 
tickets will iiave to be secured at the 
Alumni Office. Seats will also be 
on sale at Mellor's, downtown, up un
til a few days before the per
formance.
The show itself is rapidly rounding 
into something recognizable as a 
musical comedy and the chorus is 
improving and improving. In fact, 
its getting so good that the man
agers have great trouble in dispersing 
. the various onlookers, who consis
tently shout for encores long after 
the members have quit for the day.

ALL ENGLISH MINORS
Techsons to Play For 
Saturday Nite Dance
Comic Songs by ObieNewman 
to Feature May Dance
All Carnegie is invited to the Fes
tive May Dance of the Carnegie Clef 
Club to be held in the Union next 
Saturday evening between the hours 
of nine and twelve.
The music for the evening will be 
furnished by the Techsons Orchestra 
an aggregation of young college fel
lows who certainly know how to syn
copate. They have -worked  up a lot 
of new stuff especially for this dance, 
that you simply cant resist.
Two new members have recently 
been added to this sterling band of 
musicians, and they have already 
proved their worth.' John Pelican, 
on the banjo, is well known to Car
negie dancers, having played with 
the Collegiate Imps all last, summer 
at the Pines. The new violinist is 
none other than Howard Levant, who 
is one of the best leaders ever seen 
around this city. Ted Mattson and 
Hal Hunter are still producing keen 
harmony on their saxes. Squawk 
Taylor of the old Collegiate Six is 
peppier than ever on the traps. Wil
bur Corswirt on the trumpet, and Joe 
Corbett on the trombone, are in their 
best form, and Doc Dougherty is 
still coaxing elusive tunes from the 
old ivory "keyboard.
The Union will hardly be recog
nizable on Saturday evening. It will 
be transformed into a garden of fra
grant May flowers- and entwining 
boughs of blossoming, trees- This is 
an entirely new scheme of decoration,

FINAL ELECTION 
THIS THURSDAY
The Question, Who Will be

Last of Three Elections
As a result of the second primary 
election, Dot Diamond, Betsy Lindsey 
and Mary Speers .today await the 
final balloting Thursday, as candidates 
l'or Carnegies Campus Quoon.
With fifteen girls from whom to 
make a choice the entlro enrollment 
selected these three as final candi
dates. The twelve defeated co-ods 
together with the two who will lose 
on Thursday are to form the flowor 
body-guard for the Queen. But who 
will be the Queen? It is not an honor 
to be lightly given, and so tlio com
mittee asks all to cpnsldor well their 
vote, to decide who will make the 
best Queen, who is to receive the 
homage of a college in its most joy
ous days.
Coronation of the chosen boauty 
will be a flower festival In the opon 
theater, at mid-night, but now It 
soems that knighthood Is in flower 
for the spirit and electioneering of 
each knight as he rallys to his hearts 
choice lias made spirit high and in
terest intense. Great reward hinges 
on the ballot, and the final choice is 
bound to show the wisdom of this 
long drawn out solectlon.
Campus Queens have lingered long 
In the hearts of Carnegie. Thoy are 
the Ideals, the champion beauties of 
the school. With tills In mind, a rosuit that will be a credit to all will 
be returned, when the ballots are 
counted the day after tomorrow.
For over a month, starting with the

to fifteen, and then to three, this 
question has been debated In campus 
talk. It is the big event in pre-Cam(Continued on Page Four)

At University Club Friday
Last Friday evening, May 1, at the 
Univeraity Club, tho senior women of 
Carnegie held their Senior Ball, that 
never-to-be-forgotten event of their 
senior year.
This Senior Ball was in the form 
of a dinner dance. Tho festivities 
began at 7:30 p. m., and continued 
until 2:00 a. m., at which hour the 
reluctant couples were compelled to 
leave the floor, and the Senior Ball 
became past history. A full-course 
dinner was served, with dancing be
tween courses, to the harmonious 
strains of Carnegies popular orches
tra, the Collegiate Imps. The decora
tions consisted of spring flowers, and 
the gaily colored blossoms which 
adorned each table gave the room a 
truly spring-like and festive appear
ance. With a delicious dinner, in
spiring music, and beautiful decora
tions, the participants In the Senior 
Ball felt that nothing more was to 
be desired. The ball will go down

about the slaters down tho ntroot la to 
various and sundry effect.
In tho first place the kind of ve
hicle to bo employed Is a grave mys
tery. No one knows or oven dares 
to guess what the fair ladles will 
pilot to everlasting fame. The only 
clue that has been discovered Is to 
wit: c. prominent mail order house, 
Bear3 and Sawbuck, to be exact, has

Another point do combat Is the na

SENIORS
There is something pathetic about a graduating Senior. Too 
late, upon graduating, does lie realize that the way has been greased 
for him, and that he is thrown upon the world with a more or less 
incomplete idea oi; what his responsibilities will be.
From a man wjio is looked up to by the underclassmen, and 
called by name by the faculty, largely through his Seniority, he be
comes a mere cog in a machine, a non entity, dependent for his very 
life upon the degree in which lie can satisfy another man. lie is re
duced from a sort of superior person to one who must make his life 
with people who know no superiority, except ability; he must start on 
the same level us the boy who had no schooling whatsoever, and is 
usually inferior to that boy in point of experience.
There is a certain elation at the prospect of new opportunities, 
and new things; but at the same time there is a certain nameless ap
prehension ol (lie unknown, a sort of wistfulness at leaving the fa
miliar for the unfamiliar.
Of course, within a few years, most of these men will have set
tled down to some task or other, and many of them will be making a 
comfortable living. Some few will amount to nothing, derelicts, de
pendent upon the whims ol chance for their sustenance. Some few 
will become celebrities in that strange After-College which we call 
the World.
As they pass before us, we wonder what each will be. And as 
we think of them, wo think ol' ourselves, with our boundless promise, 
our inpatient intolerance of failure, and. we wonder.
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT
The selection of Lloyd Yoder for President of I he Student Coun
cil for the next year came after one of the most hotly contested elec
tions ever held in the Student Council. It was early apparent that 
the choice lay between Yoder and Bcode, There was little to choose 
in the way of ability between either of tho men, and the vote was 
clearly a matter of personal opinion of the members of the Council.
There were several ballots east, all of which were ties, or else had 
not the majority of voting members which is required for election ac
cording to I he Constitution of tho Council. Finally, however, Yoder 
was elected.
The Carnegie Tartan takes this opportunity of congratulating 
the newly elected President and to wish him luck in his now posi
tion. We feel that, the Council could male* no mistake in choosing 
either of the two men, and next years Council is indeed fortunate, 
that it will Imvo both men upon it.
Tho fact that the ballot was so close, and so many were required, 
moroly goes to show how convinced wore the supporters of each man 
that lie was best fitted for tho position. Those who voted clearly 
thought before so doing, and the students may feel satisfied that the 
results of tho election were arrived at after a comprehensive survey 
of the whole situation by the Student Council._______________________

LEADERS SELECTED
The Week 
in the 
Worlds News
By Leslie P. Beebe
1. The Election of Von Hindcnburg.
2. All Big Powers Return To Gold 
8tandardc.
An individual and not a cause won 
the German election on April 26. Tho 
world was taken back, when from of
ficial quarters, came the announce
ment that Field Marshal Paul von 
Hindcnburg, a MonarchiBt, had been 
elected preBldent of the Gorman Re
public against Marx and Tliaeman.
In analysing the result after the 
Bmoko ol emotionalism and hysteria 
has begun to pass away, the situa
tion doesn't look as serious us at 
first. How many times in history 
have popular military heroes been 
made political rulers? Take for ex
ample, Cromwell in England, Napor 
loon In France, arid Washington and 
Grant in the United States. The Field 
Marshal Is one of the great idols of 
the German people. Massive, stern, 
dignified and looking like a Norse 
god, he Is greeted on every occasion 
by ovations.
Hindonburg carried Bavaria, the 
heart of the monarchistic movement, 
as expected; Prussia swung to him, 
fearing apparently more communistic 
bloodshed and uprisings; East Prus
sia voted almost to a man to elect 
him, apparently on the strength of his 
delivering them from the Russian in
vasion in the last war, and the coun
try districts were particularly strong 
for the old war horse, as he is af
fectionately called. The Rhine dis
trict, which is occupied noAV by allied 
troops, voted against him, the feeling 
seeming to be that they wanted to tie 
to someone who was swinging for 
peace.
The situation is unfortunate as re
gards its effect upon foreign coun
tries. The Dawes plan had put a feel
ing of certainty into the Europeun sit
uation. The nations of the world 
were beginning in. a small way to for
get their differences; to get their fi
nances on a more stable basis, and 
what is doubly important, to get down 
to work. This election has throAvn a 
chill over the raised hopes of Europe. 
England will find it harder to get a 
formula for peace, French prejudice 
will be increased and America will sit 
back and wait. Germany has chosen 
to run enormous risks in thus letting 
her sentimentality get away with her.
One incident of note occurs us we 
go to press which may mean little or 
much. Chancellor Luthon after his 
first talk with President-elect Hlhdenburgj in an important speech be
fore the German Industrial and com
mercial conference, calls for the evac
uation of Cologne by the entente, In
sisting that In their present disarmed 
state sho needed to bo guaranteed by 
a security past just as much as the 
allies. How, much of this came from 
Hindonburg and how much it forbodes 
for tho future, is a matter of conjec
ture. The worlds eyOs will be on 
Germany for some time to come and 
she will continue to hold the center 
of tho worlds political stage.
To got batik to normalcy, has been 
the, cry raised over since tho armlstlco.was signed, and whllo the world 
has shown signs hero and thoro, no 
Indication of groator importune could 
bo given than that Included In Winfltod Churchill's speech boforo the 
British parliament whore ho announc
ed the return ol! England to a gold 
standard, mentioning that both Aus
tralia and Now Zealand woro taking 
similar steps. Canada had, and tho 
Union of South Africa would take sim
ilar stops on July 1. Holland, tho 
Dutch East Indies, Swoeden, Ger
many, Austria, Hungary and the Unit
ed States have already joined the 
ranks, so that now practically the en
tire majority of big trading nations 
have re-established their monetary 
standards.
In the same speech the chancellor 
announced the restoration of the Mc
Kenna customs taxes 'on imported lux
uries. imposing new protective duties, 
reducing income taxes and the super
tax and increasing the benefits to the 
poor and aged and death duties.
To take the proper precautions in 
this step, the treasury has collected 
for reserve 153,000,000 in gold, has 
bought $166,000,000 worth and has ar
ranged for credit in the United States 
of $300,000,000, to be used in case 
of necessity. $200,000,000 of this 
money was put on credit by the Fed
eral Reserve Bank and the other 
$100,000,000 by the firm of J. Pierpont 
Morgan.
By the silver and gold export con
trol act of 1920, the export of gold 
was prohibited without a license. This 
act expires this December. To quote 
from the chancellors speech, We 
therefore have decided that.although 
the prohibition of the export of gold 
will continue in form on the statue 
booolcs until December 31, a general 
license will bo given the Bank of Eng
land for the export of gold and bullion 
from today on. Wo thus rosume our 
International position as a gold stand
ard country from tlio moment this 
declaration is made.
It. is doubtful whether the Bank of 
lOngland will need our credit. The' 
gold borrowed by tho Bank of Eng
land from tho Bank of Franco In the 
Baring crisis of 35 years ago was re
turned with the original seals un
broken. However, it is a very wise 
safeguard. England lias taken the 
only reasonable step, a step that they 
have been aiming at for some time.
All the world will rejoice and will 
have good reason for rejoicing.
IN OUR LETTER BOX
To The Editor of The Tartan:
After reading the article on woman 
in your Thats That column and 
the criticism on it I felt Inclined to 
siied a little light on that subject 
myself. As far as experience goes 
I believe I am Jn a little better posi
tion to judge than either of your 
previous writers.
In using the word pal your first 
writer did not define his meaning. A 
woman can be and very frequently 
Is a pal to her husband. Where a 
girl Is a pal to a man in the sense 
th3 writer meant all he has said is 
true.
Your second writerthe authoress 
of the criticismhad a just cause jn 
defending her sex. She did it 
splendidly but made a mistake in 
citing her examples. She should 
have asked the author of the Thats
That" column to take any twenty or
dinary families and prove that of 
even -five of them the husband and 
wife were not pals. I am sure that 
he would have been surprised at his 
results.
It is not the noted few that prove 
a point such as this. It is the great 
j mass. Woman has a beautiful place 
In the advancement of the world and 
In being a true pal she is doing noth
ing new. Woman has always been a 
pal a helpmateand at many times 
a leader of an almost beaten man. 
Give her credit boys.
I hope the author of the "Thats 
That column may get a wifeif he 
does not have onethat is the pal to 
him that my wife has been to me.

HYDRAULICS LAB. 
RECONSTRUCTED
Advantage Taken of Needed 
Repairs to Remodel and 
Improve Lab.
Extensive repair work and altera
tions have been in progress in the 
Hydraulic laboratory during the past 
four months and are now approach
ing' completion. For a number of 
years the concrete floor of this labor
atory has been gradually sinking, the 
cause of this being the tendency of 
the underlying soil to slide in the di
rection of the deep ravine north of 
the Science building. By December 
of the present school year, a cavern 
of considerable size had developed 
under the laboratory floor; and the 
settlement of the floor had become so 
serious that heavy strains were 
thrown on piping and machinery. Un
der these conditions it was consid
ered to continue the use of the labor
atory for student work; and at the 
beginning of the Christmas holidays, 
the laboratory equipment was dis
mantled, and the old concrete floorbroken up and removed.
Upon the digging of test pits into 
the underlying soil, it was found that 
it' was an artificial fill of soft clay 
many feet in thickness and quite un
suitable for supporting a floor carry
ing heavy machinery. It was there? 
fore decided to rebuild the laboratory 
floor with reinforced concrete, and to 
support it on girders and columns 
resting on the main footings of the 
Science building Avhlcli are founded 
on bed rock. The work of concreting 
was carried on during the coldest 
weather of the winter, and numerous 
difficulties were encountered in 
transporting sand, gravel, and cement 
to the site of the laboratory. In the 
end a floor was laid which will be 
rigid and permanent under heavy 
loading.
Advantage has been taken of this 
repair work to make numerous al
terations in the arrangement of pip
ing and the equipment -ill the Hydrau
lic laboratory. In making these al
terations the primary consideration 
has been to secure more favorable 
conditions for student work in the 
laboratory. Other considerations 
wore tho reserving of space for new 
pieces of apparatus required to ltoep 
tho laboratory work In touch with 
modern hydraulic Interests, and the 
providing of facilities for hydraulic 
resoarch.
In remodeling the laboratory much 
study has been given to the prob
lem of securing adequate lighting and 
drainage, clearance and freedom of 
interference between different pieces 
of apparatus, and tho providing of 
piping with a sufficient number of 
valves and connections to make it 
possible for students to work in 
groups of not more than three. Un
der former conditions light was ex
cluded from the laboratory by a tank 
house which covered two windows, 
and by the obstruction of other win
dows by large pieces of equipment; 
the drainage arrangements were 
such that water could accumulate on 
the floor to a depth of several inch
es; and piping connections made it 
difficult to conduct various experi
ments by other than the class de
monstration" method. In the new 
laboratory all windows have been 
cleared, a complete drainage system 
has been installed below the floor 
level and numerous new pipes and 
valves have been provided to secure 
flexibility of operation and to Insure 
a liberal flow to each piece of appar
atus.
New and larger piping is provided 
for experiments on the flow of water 
in pipe lines, in order to take advan
tage of the full capacity of the exist
ing centrifugal pump equipment. The 
alteration plans provide for the re
servation of floor space for four ma
jor pieces of new equipment:-an open

ARIEL, By Andre Maurols.
"ArielLife of Shelley. That title 
is inviting for two reasons: primarily, 
because one is mystified by the word 
Ariel, secondly, because the story 
of the life of any great man always 
arouses curiosity. It always has 
seemed unfair to me that men or 
women who reach great heights in 
this world should be subjected to such 
harsh criticism as they undoubtedly 
receive. Why is it that a minister is 
expected to be free from human frailities? He is only one man out of a 
million. The only difference between 
him and any other man is that his 
star is just a little higher up in the 
heavens, and lie is striving a great 
deal harder to hitch his wagon to it.
But I am off on a tangent. I be
gan by remarking that any man who 
strives to reach above the heads of 
his fellow creatures in this world, au
tomatically subjects himself to severe 
censure. In Ariel, Andre Maurois 
draws very vividly for the reader, a 
picture of the intimate life of- Percy 
Bysshe Shelley. As a very young 
child, Shelley was "different. At the 
preparatory school age, lie became re
bellious. He worshipped beauty, and 
he resented any restrictions which 
convention might place upon his en
joyment of it. He was misunderstood 
at college; he was literally persecuted 
for his ideas and his expression of 
them. He never finished his college 
course, but from the time he left Ox
ford, lie wandered about Europe creat
ing for himself a little world of his 
own wherever he went. In this small 
world, his friends revolved about him, 
and were attracted toward him as the 
satallites of the moon revolve about 
it and are attracted toward it. Some
how, throughout the story of his very 
unconventional life, the reader does 
not become thoroughly disgusted with 
the man, rather, he pities him. Why 
compassion should be aroused in this 
particular case instead of the disgust 
that is generally stimulated by such 
stories, 1 am at a loss to explain, un
less that feeling might be traced to 
the fact that a person born without 
any conception of convention is as 
much to be pited as one born without 
sight. But this feeling of pity for 
such persons is by no means univer
sal; and .right here is- tho question 
that is in my mind as to the material 
value of such books to the reading 
public.
The first time I- ever heard of the 
book, someone told me that if 1 ever 
wanted to enjoy any of Shelleys 
poems again, not to read this story of 
his intimate life. "A word to the 
wise is sufficient, but, unfortunately, 
most people are not wise, hence, being 
in tills latter category, I was not able 
to rest at night until I had "Ariel" 
in my possession. However, my 
friend who warned me concerning 
Ariel was sadly disillusioned by the 
book. Shelley had always been her 
favorite poet, and she had admired 
his wonderful power of picturing 
beauty in nature more than any of the 
other poets. She had imagined his. 
life to be one of perfect harmony with 
the rest of the world; she had pic
tured him as a man of firm religious 
beliefs, if not actually devout; and
steel channel forty feet long for ex
periments on the hydraulics of flow 
in channels, a steel frame twenty-two 
feet long for experiments on the hy
draulic jump and related phenomena, 
a large valimetric tnak for the con
trol of accuracy in all work done in 
the laboratory, and a table equipped 
for the demonstration of hydraulic 
principles and the carrying on of 
special researches.
The repair and remodeling work 
in the Hydraulic laboratory has been 
carried on by the regular Institute 
forces under the direction of Colonel 
Fairley, the plans being prepared by 
Professor Thomas.

Chemical Industry.
This series, arranged primarily for 
the benefit of chemists of the Pitts
burgh district, has so far been suc

SCHENLEY THEATER
Coopers Collegians, an orchestra of 
11 talented players, all of them col
lege men from Carnegie and Pitt, will 
be the extra attraction on the pro
gram in the Schenley theater through
out the week of May 4.
On Monday, Tuesday and Wednes
day Johnny Hines will be seen in his 
dashing, clever, thrill comedy, "The 
Speed Spook, while on Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday the picture at
traction will be Conway Tearle and 
Sigrid Helmquist in the interesting 
modern drama, School for Wives.
The story of The Speed Spook 
was written by William Wallace Cook 
and centers about an automobile race, 
this phase of the film having been 
made at Altoona, Pa. Johnny Hines, 
who is one of filmdoms stars, claim
ing Pittsburgh as his home, has the 
role of Blue Streak Billings, who 
Teturns to his home town after win
ning an international automobile race, 
and finding himself the town hero, is 
compelled to live up to the reputation 
he has made for himself.
School for Wives is adapted from 
Leonard Merricks novel, The House 
of Lynch. Betty Lynch, daughter of 
wealth, falls in love with Richard 
Keith, a poor artist. Keith is prevent
ed from proposing by the fact that he 
is poor and also because there is a 
popular belief that the Lynch millions 
are tainted. Betty, however, consents 
to renounce all claim ,upon her fath
ers millions in order to bring a happy 
climax for their romance.
she had expected that a man of the 
nature that she accredited to him 
would love but once, and remain faith
ful to that love throughout his life. 
In direct contrast to lier own ideas 
of the poet, she finds  a man whose 
morality is questioned generally by 
the public, and who is ostracised by 
good society; a man who openly con
fesses his atheism; and lastly, one 
whose poor policy it is to fall in love 
with every beautiful woman he meets. 
In place of a life of harmony and 
pleasant relationships, she finds one 
of discordance and tragedy.
Will this knowledge of Shelley, the, 
man, in addition to that of Shelley; 
the poet, do anyone in this world any 
particular good? If so, why not let 
those who desire to know more inti
mately the sordid side of life seek it 
in its seclusion? By. bringing these 
undesirable things to light, no one is
State Dept. Official 
Lectures to Students
Tells Classes in Economics 
of European Conditions
Speaking before the Economic stu
dents on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. 
William R. Castle, .Jr., head of the 
Western European Division of the
State Department, emphasized the
need for greater attention to eco
nomic principles in drawing theboundary lines of the new states.
He pointed out that in the Peace 
Conference at Paris, too much em
phasis was placed upon races and
too little upon economic sufficiency. 
Thus in creating the new states 
they were guided too much by. the 
former consideration and too little 
my economic consideration.
By way of example, Mr. Castle 
quoted the case of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. By the terms of the 
treaty, this Empire had taken away 
from her the following territories: 
Transylvania, Bukovina, Galicia, 
Trieste, Delmatia, Bosnia, Herzogovina, Bohemia and Moravia. By this 
division she lost all her mineral de
posits, timber lands and water pow
er. Again, Vienna is the business 
center of that section, all industries 
having their offices in Vienna. When 
Austria-Hungary was stipped of these 
territories, in which her factories and 
manufacturers were located, she was 
left only with the offices of their for
mer industries. The. only physical 
asset which remained was her farm
ing lands. Even these are insufficient 
to feed her population; as a result 
she will be dependent upon the gen
erosity of the world during the next 
Twenty years.
Another act of the Conference at 
Paris was the awarding to Poland of 
a strip of land extending from that 
country to the Baltic Sea. This strip 
of land, known as the Polish Corri
dor, divides Germany ' into two 
parts. Thus Poland has acquired a 
seaport, but this move is a crime 
economically; Germany needs this 
territory and she is bound to get it 
back, either by peaceful means or 
by force.
Again,' the new State of Czecho
slovakia, a country looking like an 
elongated sausage four hundred miles 
long and less than fifty miles wide, 
bordered by five states and composed 
of many more, finds herself constant
ly in boundary difficulties, compli
cated problems Of customs, and the 
great difficulty of maintaining her
self on a firm economic footing.
Mr. Castle moved rapidly from one 
European state to another, giving a 
brief description of its conditions 
and reiterated constantly to him 
premise, the great and crying need 
of economic sufficiency in tre draw
ing of boundary lines.
materially benefitted, and yet, at the 
same time, some joy is being taken 
out of life for someone.
It certainly seems to me that it is 
a case of an ill wind that blows no
body good!

Fielding faultlessly behind Conrad, 
who was in excellent form Saturday 
at State College, the Tartan nine de
feated the Nittany Lions in a hardfought struggle, score 5-3. This vic
tory marked the first that has been 
won from the Center countains by a 
Skibo team in a major sport.
It was a cold, cloudy day, with a 
stiff breeze blowing across the field, 
making it difficult for the players to 
field fly balls, but despite that handi
cap, the Tartans had only one error 
chalked up against them, that by Con
rad himself when he tlirewr wildly to 
second in a made-to-order double play. 
This was a costly misplay, for two 
runs later scored. Connie, however, 
made up for it by pitching masterful 
ball during the remainder of the bat
tle, holding the Penn Staters safely 
throughout. In the third inning Wil
son hit a line drive to center. Bastian fell sprawling on the slippery 
grass in attempting to field it, and the 
ball went over his head for a home 
run. Penn State had other chances to 
score, but each time air-tight fielding 
by Newman, Vogt and Lynch, or a 
strikeout by Conrad put a damper on 
the home teams chances, cutting a 
rally short. Penn State scored twice 
in the second. Styborski- led with a 
single and Harris was safe on Con
rads error. Kerstetters single scored 
Styborski and Harris stole home 
while Carnegie Tech was throwing 
the ball around. Wilsons homer ac
counted for the final State tally in the 
third.
Christoff led off the Skibo fourth 
with a single. Maurer walked, Sty
borski dropped Newmans liner and 
Christoff scored. Kerstetter hurled 
Lynchs attempted sacrifice to center 
field, Mauer scoring, and Newman 
counted on Diffieys single.
The Sltibos clinched the game in 
the fifth. Christoff was safe on an 
error by Schwartz. Singles by Maurer, 
Lynch and Vogt followed and two runs 
crossed. Except in these rounds, 
Page pitched steady ball.
The fielding features of the game 
were sensational shoe-string catches 
by Bastian and Wilson, a fine running 
catch of a liner by Bahr, and a diffi? THE WEEK IN SPORTS

Many of the students are at a loss 
as to what procedure is required be
fore they are allowed to play on the 
tennis court. These courts cost con
siderable in the upkeep, and it is no 
more than fair that the expense 
should fall upon those who use the 
courts. Although the amount taken 
in from dues paid to the Tennis 
club is not sufficient to cover ex
penses, it is deemed advisable to 
keep the cost to the student as low 
as possible so that many will be
come interested in the game. On

FRESHMEN DEFEAT 
INDIANA NOR. 10-4
Ninth Inning Rally Scores Six 
Runs; Teamwork is Best 
Shown to Date
By doing the unexpected thing at 
the most unexpected time, the Plebes 
broke a tie that existed at the begin
ning of the ninth inning in their game 
at Indiana Normal last Wednesday, 
and finally won 10-4. It was one of 
the best games the Plebes have play
ed this season, and led on by their 
newly elected captain, R. W. Hurd, 
set a new standard of play for the 
games to come. There were no out
standing stars, but Goodlin deserves 
credit for starting the rally which 
ended, so well.
Carnegie scored first, making two 
markers in the third inning and two 
more in the fourth. Indiana tied the 
score in the eighth after they had 
scored two runs in the sixth stanza. 
These were the only innings in which 
j-luson was in hot water. Lindberg, 
be^rie doing the hurling duty for the 
teachers, batted in the clean-up posi
tion, making more hits than any of 
his team mates, or his opponents.
The plujT that won the game was a 
bunt when everybody expected a long 
sacrifice fly. Three Plebes were on 
base, one out, when Coach Robertson 
ordered this bit of strategy. Not be
ing content with trying it once, they 
continued doing it until six runs had 
been scored, and the game safely 
salted away.

The varsity track team meets 
Geneva College in the Skibo

added attraction to. the Interscho
lastic affair. Last yoar Geneva 
made tile trip to Pittsburgh for- the 
same event, and was beaten by Cainegie in the last few minutes of' 
the meet.
Due to the fact that Genevt lias a 
strong team this season some of the 
track men of known ability that, are 
at present playing on the baseball 
team, may try to arrange to take 
part in-the track meet.
Last week Shriver, who was with 
the baseball squad on its Eastern 
trip, returned to Pittsburgh early 
to take part in the Allegheny meet.

RAIN INTERFERES WITH * 
CONTESTS OF LAST WEEK v
THE INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET
Saturday will mark Carnegie Tocli's Ninth Annual Interscholastic track 
and field meet in the Tartan Bowl. This annual evont has come to mean 
more and more each year, so that the meet Saturday is expected to draw 
more than 650 athletes from bona fide high schools in the Tri-State district 
to the Bowl.
Think what this means. The cream of the high school athetes within a 
large radius of Pittsburgh will be the guests of Carnegie Tech. Most of these 
boys are contemplating going to college. Which college are they going vo 
select? Obviously, the one that appeals to them the most.
The point is this: We have an excellent schoolin fact, we surpass
nearly every other college along certain lines. It is our duty to take a per
sonal interest in these high school athletes, help them in every possible way 
while they are here, show them every courtesy, and incidentally, point out to 
them the advantages of attending a school like Carnegie. The results are 
bound to be forthcoming.* **** *
THE EASTERN TRIP 
The baseball team brought home the bacon on the second inva
sion of the East last week. The first two games, those against Ju
niata College and Bucknell, were cancelled on account of rain. For 
a while Saturday it looked as though the State game would have to 
be called off, but the clouds passed over and Carnegie was able to 
defeat Penn State for the first time in a major sport since the two 
institutions have been locking horns in the various sports. State 
will meet the Skibo nine in baseball at Forbes Field Friday, and if 
Conrad is right we predict that State will meet with the second re
versal. The achievement of the Tartans is all the more noteworthy 
by reason of the belief at Penn State that their baseball team is 
better this season than it has been for several years.
The victory over Penn State was fully deserved. State failed to 
hit in the pinches, when hits meant runs, while the Skibos bunched 
their hits and took advantage of every opportunity. The fielding 
of the Tartans was the best so far this year, the infield especially 
performing like veterans. The lusty and continued rooting of the 
State cheering section failed to affect the work of Captain Conrad or 
any of his men.
The battle Friday will be another hectic one.****** *
TRACK
The dual track meet with Allegheny brought, out the fact that the Tartans 
are improving steadily under the careful coaching of Guy Halferty and Howdy 
Dykeman. There is still room for plenty of improvement, but champions 
cannot be developed out of mediocre material in a few weeks. The meet 
with Geneva Saturday promisos some keen competition, as last year the 
Tartans were able only to nose out Geneva by a small margin.
The Plebes are also improving. They easily won their third successive 
meet, and hopes are entertained of giving the powerful Pitt Freslunon a 
real contest when they meet.*******
Every one of the tennis matches scheduled for last week were 
postponed because of rain. The courts were in poor condition at W. &
J. and also at Youngstown where Rayen High was to be met on Sat
urday by the Plebes.*******
The baseball team encountered snow in the mountains ubovo Hunting

Bucknell. Vogt just missed doing it by a hair.*******

TENNIS TOURNAMENT | PLEBES ELECT R.W. HURD 
FOR FRESHMAN SQUAD AS BASEBALL CAPTAIN
Arnold Fink, coach of the basket, 
ball teams, has arrangod a novel 
method by which he can koep in 
touch with all possible material for 
the lined-court squad. In previous 
years, those Freshmen who did not 
make the squad, wore given the yollow slij), with the result that many 
a good man was rejected before ho 
was able to show to ad vantage. This 
year, through the untiring efforts of 
Coach Fink and Manager Young, a 
tournament has boon arranged for 
the Plebes who wore not capable of 
carrying the Skibo colors, but have 
enough ability to cause the coach to 
koep an ever watchful eye on them.
The idea of the tournament is not 
Lo win a trophy, for no cup Is at 
stake, and no worldly award is forth
coming to the winner, but the games 
are' arranged so that the Plebos do 
not lose Interest, and any man who 
shows to advantage will be given a 
chance for next year's varsity squad. 
By doing this, the coach will-be able 
to keep a close watch upon the men, 
and direct each player separately, 
with the possibility of a developed 
player in the future. The tourna
ment,yas arranged by Student Man
ager R. R. Young, calls for ten pre
liminary matches, the winners to be 
eliminated as the games progress 
When a man loses he in turn plays 
the loser of another match, and so 
on. By this method no player is 
permitted to stop, but must continue 
with the rest if he wishes to be con
sidered at all.
The first match will be played as 
soon as the weather permits. Fol
lowing is a list of the ten pairs of 
players: Johnson and Farril; Budle
and Eisenberg, Schneider and Tener, 
Russell and Stoudt, Johnson and Al
len, Montgomery and Loney, Hagan 
and Kandell, Browstein and Malone, 
Stott and Perry, Graham and Bye.

BESTS ALLEGHENY
Tartans Defeat Meadville 
Representatives by 
70-65 Score
The Skibo track team, for the sec
ond timo in the last two years, de
feated Allegheny Collogo in tho Car
negie Bowl last Saturday afternoon. 
It w the initial dual meet of tho 
season for tho Plaid, and the victory 
of 70 to G5 was well earned. A good 
sized crowd saw tho homo team romp 
off with the honors of tho day.
The points wore equally divided in 
tho track events, each school garner
ing 3ti apiece. Carnegie piled up 
four firsts and the visitors did like
wise, It was the hammer throw 
event which enabled the Plaid to 
forgo ahead of the Moadvilleans, in 
that tho latter failed to enter any 
representatives. Consequently, Nesbit, Yoder and Bulllngor won the 
first three places lor Carnegie, bring
ing tho Skibos from 61 to 70 points.
One of the features of the meet 
iwas the handy fashion in which Mc
Kinney won tho half mile. Ray, of 
Allegheny, took the lead at tho out
set, but the Tartan runner forged to 
tho front on tho home stretch and 
broke tho tapo in a burst of speed. 
Bior, another member of tho Penn 
rolny team, finished third in this 
race.
Stultzs wide margined victories in 
the 120 high and low hurdles left 
nothing to bo desired along this line. 
Ho Hashed ton yards in tho lead at 
tho start and managed to hold this 
position to the tape. Dyke, tho 
Penn relay anchor man, won tho 
quarter mile by a spurt of speed in 
tho last fow yards, nosing out his 
teammate Kolly. Williams of tho 
visitors, was a poor third. Blanchard. 
Allegheny s crack mllor, had things 
Ills own way during tho entire mllo 
evont. Although tho race was won 
in fall* time, the Moadvlllo represen
tative crossod tho finish apparently 
as frosh as lie was at tho outsot, 
heading Captain Jack Bright by IS 
feot. Bright also took a second In 
tho two-mllo run, displaying line form 
In both ovonts.
Allegheny is roputed to have a lino 
track aggregation this sp'rlng, so that 
tho Plaid's victory may be consider
ed as forecasting a successful sea
son.

GALA ATTIRE FOR 
MARDI GRAS FOLK
No One Admitted Unless in 
Costume For Annual 
Spanish Affair
Mention has/been made of the fact 
that both costumes 'and tickets will 
bo necessary for entrance to the Mar* 
dl Gras. During previous yearn, half
hearted attempts have been made to 
carry this out but no very strenuous 
measures have boon taken to make it 
effective. . However, this year, both 
requirements will be rigidly adhered 
to, and no ono will be permitted to 
enter unless ho has both a costume 
and a ticket.
There are numerous other events 
that ono may attend at both Campus 
Week, and during the year -where cos
tumes cannot be worn, so that when 
ono has tho opportunity to dress up 
and give vent to his artistic ten
dencies, such as at tho Mardi Gras. 
It is possible that some may object 
to this on the grounds that it is too 
much trouble and that It is unneces
sary, but the nature of a Mardi Gras 
does not permit of any drab formality 
In tho absence of civilian clothes. 
Rather Is the event one of unre
strained frivolity, and joyousness, 
whore everyone is expected to have a 
most glorious time. Just a few peo
ple without costumes can spoil the 
whole spirit of tho evening. The 
alumni are earnestly requested to 
lceep tills in mind and to assist' in 
making tho Mardi Gras a decided suc
cess by coming dressed in the most 
gala attire they can find.
If any of tho alumni have not yet 
ordered their C. W. tags, they should 
do It Immediately. Not only will they 
bo required for admission to most of 
the minor events, blit they will be 
absolutely essential for entrance to 
the Mardi Gras. There will not be 
any tickets sold at tho door on Friday 
night. Anyone who has not obtained 
his ticket before this will not bo able 
to got In. In this way, no one who Is 
not a Carnegie student or graduate 
will bo able to gain admission and 
tho Mardi Gras will be a more truoly 
Carnegie affair. It Is slncoroly hoped 
that the alumni will remember this 
and that they will endeavor to got 
their tickets as soon as possible,

pus Week activities. In a short 
space of two days tho burning issue 
will be solved. Carnegie will lrnvo a 
Quo on.
Voting is scheduled for noon. 
Names as tho vqters cast their ballots 
will be checked off and every effort 
made to keep everything square and 
(o prevent stuffing tho box. As usual 
girls will rule tho polls in each col
lege, and all will await (lie answer 
to the question that signs liavo de
manded, interest has required, and 
now that desire has made intense. 
Who will be Campus Queen?
Alumni, did you notice in the1 last 
issue of the Tartan the following:
1. Final Campus Week dope?
2. Requirements for Mardi Gras?
8. Alumni swim in gym pool?
4. Alumni parade after banquet?
. 5. Alumni, you should?
Only a trifle over a week until j 
Campus Week will be here in full 
Hwlng. Have you made all arrange
ments and get set for a good time?
Alumni arrangements are rounded 
out in good shape. All committees 
are busy making final arrangements 
and everything seems to point to
wards one of the best ever. Perhaps 
the slogan, "Let's Reach the Peak for 
Campus Week, will be realized.
As has usually been the case, Cam
pus Week has found the campus in 
more or less of a mess. Eut even 
though the grass on the quad and 
around the gym is not showing, the 
permanent Improvements tliat are be
ing made will be final and some time 
in the near future we should have a 
real campus.
From the North; East, West and the 
South men from many of the larger 
companies are coming to the Alumni 
Office to interview Seniors.
The following are a few of those 
who interviewed Geary during the 
last week:
W. O. Bursch from the General 
Electric Company, Lynn, Mass., and 
W. W. Nelson, representing the same 
company, but from the Schenectady 
office.
Representing the Bell Telephone 
Company was M. B. Long from the 
New York laboratories, J. L. Heyd 
from tiie Philadelphia office, D. M. 
Morris from the Cleveland office and 
H. II. Wilson from the Pittsburgh 
office.
Mr. Cleary from the Western Elec
tric and Mr. Pope from the Worthing
ton Pump Company interview a large 
number.
The American Rolling Mill Com
pany of Middletown, Ohio, was repre
sented by C. II. Murray. The White 
Motor Company of Cleveland by Mr. 
Moultrie.
From the Firestone Rubber Com
pany of Akron was Mr. Stuhler, the 
Kelly-Sprlngfleld Tire Company of 
Cumberland,' Md., Mr. Saunders. From 
the llemy Electric Company of Ander
son, Ind., was M. M. Roberts.
All the preparations have been 
made for the alumni luncheon, and 
the only remaining essential for its j 
success is that every alumnus who 
possibly can will send In his order for 
tickets now. It will be impossible to 
make reservations after May 11 since 
tiie contract will have been made 
with' the hotel and tickets will no 
longer be on sale. The price of the 
tickets is two dollars. They can be 
obtained by sending a check to G. L. 
Tillbrook at the Alumni Office.
The banquet will be held at 12:45 
on Saturday, May 16, in the Win. 
Penn ballroom. Bus service will be 
provided which will enable alumni to 
lose no time in going directly from 
the campus to the hotel and back, 
so that they will not miss any of the 
events taking place at school.

Compete During C.W.
Champions Will Aga n Play 
on the Home Courts
iDuring the past' year criticism has I 
been collected and studied by the j 
Alumni Office and the General Cam
pus Week Committee. Some of the j 
criticisms made could not well be | 
called logical, but in many cases I 
they were fair and as a result action 
has been taken to better the existing ; 
conditions. The criticism and action 
taken as a result in each case is given 
below.
1. THAT THE ALUMNI HAVE 
HAD NO PLACE IN THE PAST TO 
CONGREGATE AND TO RENEW 
OLD SCHOOL FRIENDSHIPS.
As a result of this criticism many 
things have been done.
a. An Alumni Tennis Team has 
been organized. This team will com
pete with the Varsity on Saturday 
morning, May 16, 1925. Any alum
nus who is interested in this activity 
may get the dope "PERSONAL by 
writing to Edward F. Hirsch, E., 20, 
care of West Penn Power Company, 
West Penn Power Building? Pitts
burgh, Pa.
>b. The new swimming pool has 
.been secured for the men and women 
alumni for parties. The women have 
the pool on Friday afternoon from 
3:00 p. m. until 6:00 p. m., and the 
men have it from 10:00 a. m. until 
12:00 noon Saturday.
2. THAT THE ALUMNI DURING 
THE PAST CAMPUS WF.EKS 
HAVE BEEN-GIVEN VERY LITTLE 
ATTENTION. AND THAT CAMPUS 
WEEK WAS PRIMARILY A STU
DENT FUNCTION.
The following things have been 
done to remedy this condition:
a. The Alumni Office has moved 
its headquarters to the porch of the 
Library Hut on Woodlawn avenue. 
Someone will be there every minute 
to register returning alumni; take 
messages for classmates who also 
may be there; to aid alumni in lo
cating friends; to give information 
concerning events on the program; 
and to be at the alumnis disposal 
in order to aid them in any way pos
sible.

The Alumni Office have succeeded 
in getting in touch with the follow
ing alumni in regards to the tennis 
team that will compete in the alumni-varsity tennis matches during 
Campus Week: Connie Schwartz,
Tweets Davis, Jack Batty, Phil Mar
shall, Schuckman, Wolfe, Jim OCon
ner, Schmertz, Toots Davis, Steve 
Stockslager, Copley, and Harry S'emor who is to be coach of the team. 
Some of these men have already sig
nified their willingness to play, and 
it is expected that the rest of them 
will soon fall in line.
It is hoped that it will be possible 
to get the entire 1920 tennis team 
together. This was the team that won 
the Tri-State Championship so easily 
in that year. It might be added here 
that the Carnegie tennis teams also 
won this same championship in 1921, 
1922, 1923. Eddie Hirsch, alumni 
manager of the tennis events, says: 
The prospects, for getting the whole  
1920 team together and giving the 
alumni a chance to see them in ac
tion just as they were five years 
ago, are very bright.
The alumni-varsity tennis matches 
will be held on the courts beside 
Margaret Morrison, Saturday morn
ing, May 16, at ten-thirty. These 
courts are rapidly being rounded into 
shape, and the players can count on 
being able to play at their best un
less disturbed by old man Pluvius. 
With favorable weather conditions, 
the onlookers should be given a sight 
worth seeing.

3. THAT MARDI GRAS' ALWAYS 
HAS HAD TOO MANY OUTSIDERS 
PRESENT AND IN A LARGE MEA
SURE HAS LOST ITS CARNEGIE 
SPIRIT.
The following plan has been inau
gurated to prevent this condition this 
year.
a. Students are allowed two Cam
pus Week Tags. No more can be 
secured as each students registration 
card will be punched as the tags are 
sold.
b* Alumni may secure Campus 
Week Tags through the Alumni Of
fice only. The sale closes on May 11 
at 5:00 p. m. This means that out
siders will not be able to buy tickets 
at the dance hall doors the night of 
Mardi Gras.
4. THAT THE MARDI GRAS IS 
A STUDENT FUNCTION AND 
THAT ALUMNI CANNOT PARTICI
PATE AS THEY MIGHT.
Concessions made in order that 
alumni may get together at the Mar
di Gras.
a. Half the Union has been reserv
ed for alumni dancing.. This means 
that alumni will have a place to go 
to exchange their dances and to look 
for classmates.
b. The Faculty Club Room has 
been set aside for the alumni as a 
lounging room where they may re
tire and chat between dances and at 
their leisure.
Alumni! One thing more! Re
member that the Campus Week 
Committee is working hard for 
the interests . of the alumni. It de
sires that each Old Grad feels that 
Campus Week is for him and that the 
student body is Here only to aid the 
alumni in enjoying themselves. The 
Campus Week Committee is anxious 
to receive constructive criticism so 
that Campus Week this year may be 
a bigger and better alumni affair than
