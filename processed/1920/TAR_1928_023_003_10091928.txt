on 20th
The sun shone brightly at Forbes Field last < Saturday. It seemed, as if Id Sol was doing 
his best to make the date of the first home football game of  1928 one to be remembered. His golden rays fell upon the Killy Band as they marched across the field and caused the various instruments to shine gloriously. As  the Carnegie banner was run up to the top of t'lie flagpole, accompanied by the strains of the Alma Mater, he smiled reverently upon the bare heads of the spectators and when the Purple and Gold players of Ashland College trotted out for practice lie smiled upon them, too. But, when the game was over, Carnegie rooters had no need, for Sol's influence for the score, Carnegie 65, Ashland 0, was more than sufficient to bring smiles to the faces of every Tartan fan.
The game fell far short of satisfying the wishes of those who came to see a real battle. From the first play until the last it was all Carnegie; Ashland was not in it at any i time. Long, sweeping end runs, long forward passes and smashing line plunges, all proved to be more than the visitors could stand. Play had only just started when the Plaid crossed the line for their first touchdown. Dutch Eyth, in much the sdme manner as last week, carried the ball around the ends until it was near enough for Captain Iiarpster to carry over. When Carnegie next gained possession of the ball, which was very soon indeed, the same process was repealed,^ but this time it was the rugged Karcis who took the stellar role. The Tartan fullback gained more ground through the line than Ashland was iiuli isO'garner by end runs or even by means of passes. The last of a scries of plunges by Karcis, goo^l for 12 yards, carried the ball over.Ill the second period Carnegie turned loose in earnest with Glenn Moorchcad, substituted for the injured Eyth, and Karcis scoring two touchdowns apiece. Glenns first was made on a pass from Harp- ster. Then Karcis got down to business and crashcd through Ashlands line for 35 yards and a touchdown. Of course, there were only about half of the opposing team clinging to him at any one time, but it is exceedingly doubtful if the whole team and a couple of water boys would have been any more effective. In the same period Karcis scored again, but this time he had but three yards to go before he crossed the last marker. After all this was over Moorchcad decided thaty another score would not be amiss, so he, on a pass 'from Iiarpster, carried the ball over from the three yard line.The second half showed many new faces in Carnegies lineup. Wally evidently dccided that his second and third string men could take care of any opposition that Ashland could offer. The new men not only did this, but added two

Mens Glee Club Organized; 
Annual Dance Planned for 
EveofW.&J. Game, Oct. 19
A meeting of the Mens Glee Club will be held next Sunday at 2:30 in room 157, College of Fine Arts. All men who are interested in trying out should attend. Membership is not confined to students in the Arts School; students in all colleges, day or evening, are eligible.Last Sunday the club met for the first time. In addition to many of last years men who turned out, there were a large number of freshmen. Paul Brau- tigarn,- the student director, is taking charge of the club, classifying the voices and beginning on some of the preliminary work until Mr. Harvey Gaul, who has been secured as director for the year, takes charge of the club. Tryouts will be held every Sunday afternoon before the rehearsals, and also on Wednesday evenings.A dance, the first social function of the club, will be held on the eve of the W. and J. game, October 19, in the Union. Robert Boyd, manager of _ the club, has appointed as chairman, Joseph Patterson, who is making every preparation for a real good dance. Tickets will be sold on the campus preceding the event.This dance will mark the beginning of the activities of the club, and many other events are to follow. The Carnegie Glee Club will again enter the Intercollegiate Contest, and on strength of its _ showing in the last two competitions, strong hopes are entertained. Concerts will be scheduled in and around Pittsburgh and there are possibilities of an extensive trip next spring.
STUDENTS REQUESTED TO 
REPORT ON SMMER JOBS
Students who secured positions for summer employment through the office of the Bureau of Recommendations are agaiti urged to report at once the amount of their earnings during June, July, August and September to Mr. Kristof, who is in charge of the rccords for this period. Although a few of the students who held positions this summer have handed in an account of their earnings, there is a large number who have overlooked this duty. The matter is extremely important, as a complete report on all the positions obtained through the Bureau of Recommendations is1 necessary before the records of the office can be made. Mr. Kristof is very desirous of closing the records on this period and requests all the students who have not yet done so, to make their reports within the next week.
On Carnegie Day, Tuesday, November 27, a bronze tablet in memory of Dr. Hamerschlag, the first president of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, will be unveiled. It will be placed in Administration Hall, near the Registrars Office. The work is being done by Bert- hol_d Nebel, who was formerly head of the Sculpture Department. Augustus K. Oliver, Chairman of 
the Memorial Committee of the Board of Trustees, received a letter recently from Mr. Nebel in which he stated that he expects to have the portrait finished within the next few days and will send a photograph to the Committee for Criticism. Mr. Nebel states also that Mrs. Hamerschlags criticisms have been received in the materializing of plans for the unveiling.

Council Allows Women To 
Carry Extra Activities
All four of the petitions to the Womens Point System were passed by council last week. These . petitions -were :filed by women students carrying more extra curricular activities than were allowed by the new point system. Dorothy Roy was granted by petitioning, the permission to hold Womans Editorship of The Tartan; Ruth B ramson, who is News Editor of The Tartan, was given vice-presidency of the Guild; the Managing Editor of Tri-Publica- tions, Hele^ Booth, was granted the permission to remain as Managing Editor of Tri-Publications, and Mary Hall, President of the Junior class, and Junior House President of Spruce. Hall, petitioned to council in order to retain presidency of the -class. Anyone not having petitioned and still holding extra curricular activity offices must petition before October 10, after which date all re- elections of officers will take place.
Promiscuouf kissing at an initiation at New York State Normal 
School caused the quarantine of 60 students. After the meeting one 
of the members was found to have scarlet fever, and inasmuch as she had . kissed everyone present, the whole company was placed under 
quarantine. This was a sorority so that makes it a horse from a different department.
Carnegie to Act As Host to Dele
gates Representing Twenty 
Nations
The Second International Conference on Bituminous Coal will be held under the auspices of the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the week of November 19. The First International Conference on Bituminous Coal was organized two years ago by Dr. Thomas S. Baker and was held at the Carnegie Institute. The results of this first v conference were of sUcli world-wide importance and interest aroused in the field of coal research that the necessity of a second conference was felt.
When Dr. Baker calls the Second Conference to order, his audience will include more than a hundred scientists of world-wide reputations established because of their discoveries in the field of coal research.  According to the preliminary program, about 20 nations will send representatives to the conference.  Germany, with about 20 representatives, will send the largest delegation, while France, England, and Canada will have a comparatively large number of speakers and delegates. Other countries that will be represented are: Italy, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Cuba, Czecho-Slovakia, Denmark, Japan, Jugo-Slavia, Norway, -Russia, Spain and Portugal.
The discussions and addresses of the conference will be entirely concerned with the improved utilization of coal, a subject which, viewed in the light of present conditions, is of great importance. The production of\ gasoline and other spirits from coal, the use of pulverized .coal in internal combustion engines and in ship-propelling engines, the production of synthetic rubber from coal, the manufacture of artificial fertilizers, the. liqucfica- tion of coal, and the use of coal tar and other by-products - of coal are only a few of the important subjects to be discussed at the Carnegie Conference. .Recent dis coveries in the fixation of nitrogen for the purpose of producing artificial fertilizers from the by-products of coal will occupy an important part in the coming meeting. Because of the domestic and political aspects' involved in the future utilization of Mussel Shoals, this subject will be of special and timely interest.
Series of Carnegie Public 
Lectures Open Tues. Oct. 16
The first series in the program of public lectures to .be presented this year under the auspices of Carnegie Institute of Technology will be given in the Union at 8:30 on the evenings of October 16, 17, and 18, by Dr. W. H. Hatfield of. England.Dr. Hatfield, who is the Edward De Mille Campbell Memorial Lecturer this year for the American Society of Steel Treating, is also a member of the Council of the Iron and Steel Institute, the Institute of Mechanical Engineers,' Automobile Engineers, Royal Aeronautical Society, and numerous- other British technical committees and societies.. For many years lie has been associated with the Brown- Firtli Research Laboratories, of which he is director. His. book, Cast Iron in the Light "of Recent Research, has had wide circulation in the United States as well as in Europe.
The Hatfield lectures, w'hich will be free to' the general public, will be given as follows:
On October 16, Ingot ' Making, Manipulation, Treatment;
On October 17, Iieat Resisting Alloys of Iron;On October 18, Steels of Special Physical Characteristics.The Hatfield lectures have been arranged by President Baker, who is also negotiating for the presen
tation of several other series of public lectures on technical, industrial, literary, and scini-popular subjects for the current college year;
Air mail may be said to date from the siege of Paris in 1870- 1871. During the siege fifty-four baloons with about 2,000,000 letters were sent out between September 23, 1S70, and January 20, 1871.
Over in France fighters used to box with their feet, and strangely enough, there was never any kick about it.
Uldine Utley spoke from the platform . of Soldiers Memorial Hall, Tuesday evening, October 2. A child in figure and a woman in face, she addressed a strange audience from the austere church deacon to the curiosity monger and religious fanatic.In opening Miss Utley was quite original and-said she stood in awe of all the shining faces, a very discreet evangelical attempt at humor. Her dramatic entre was completed by the chorus of a. song learned in Brookline. A prayer 
was offered up which showed at the beginning the power of Miss Utleys lungs and vocal chords. Bravo!All people were called sheep (as they should be), because they are so stupid, a very sweet compliment. The audience was entranced by til? scintillating brilliance of the 
lecturer and sat with'tears in their sheeps eyes. For the ..sake of clarity all statements were given at: least four versions, and repeated with emphasis. Standard, time- reverenced expressions such as "he plants your feet on stone not on shifting sand, .lvere much used with good effect. An appeal for converts was made in about six different ways, and members of the audience were urged to conic forward and both give up and .in,
the terms were used interchangeably. 
Many rested, others cried and 
others quite frankly looked.
Throughout the entire evening 
there were marked instances of a religious fanaticism,, common 'to this type of meeting. People carried beyond their usual depth of common sense by the picture and repetition  of well known scenes which never fail to arouse any body of people religiously inclined i to a nervous enthusiasm which vaporized as rapidly as the bubbles appear upon the surface. Loud ejaculations punctured the entire talk, many being employed by Miss Utley for emphasis. The simple truths expounded in many cases were well worth absorbing, but they were delivered > as sugar- coated doses of Something bitter. Miss Utley repeated much, was sii'glitly two garrulous and over-emphatic and in general addressed the assembly as children too small for the comprehension of anything other than a bed-time fable. Everything that wras said could have been obtained first hand by a normally intelligent human being, minus hallelujahs and amens, from the Bible at a very slight expenditure of energy and, in many cases, a clearer Understanding of actual facts.

At the last meeting of the Student Council on Tuesday evening, October 2, the cor..mittee on the Womens Activities Point System was approved. The committee is composed of Sally Hulick, Eleanor Seyler, Edith Illsley, and Cora Lee Hink. Four petition: were read for exception to the rules of the Activities Point System, and were approved.After discussing the manner of holding Freshman elections, it was decided, that all Freshman nominations for election be made by petition, was * lost after much discussion. it was decided to try the petition system later in the year. The /Senate presidents were in .ructed to call meetings of Freshman classes in their respective schools to hold nomination for class officers. The elections will _be held on October 16.The question of the salaries to be received by the students who have charge of the campus Bulletin Boards, and who take care of checking in the Union was settled, but it was not 'decided whether these came under the category of activities and could be held i by fifth year men. The decision on this point was tabled until tlie- lrieeting tonight.A' question was raised on the recommendation that Council approve phyrical examination for Freshmen before fraternity hazing. It was argued that the severe strain imposed upon the neophytes was dangerous for a person, not in perfect' physical condition. No action, wa. taken bn) the question.
Stringers to Hold Try-Outs 
Oct .7 in M.M. Assembly Hall
The Girls Glee Club held a business meeting Tuesday, October 2, at which time a group of new members was admitted and plans were formulated for, the year. The club will appear on chapel and assembly ^programs during the year.- A number of concerts off the campus and o,ut of town will also be giveiy. Air. Al Jomi.son will lead the club this year. The program of work will be accompanied by social events.
The days set for rehearsals are Tuesday from seven to eight oclock, and Thursday from four- thirty to five-thirty oclock. A uniform dress for public performances has been decided upon. The officers for the 'year arc: President, Ha'rriet Hanna; Manager, Helen Reed; Secretary-treasurer, Helen Ward; Librarian, ** Betty West; Assistant Librarian, Lois Schultz. Nominees for Assistant Manager are Olive Ritchey, Helen Dillman and Helen Bright.There is still an opportunity for | freshman girls to enter the club. Those girls who wish to join will | have a chance to try out for ad- i mittance at the rehearsals this ! week.
Tryouts for the stringers, a campus musical organization, have been announced by the president, Melba Sheppard ,and are scheduled for 4:30 oclock Wednesday, October 7, in the Margaret Morrison Assembly Room. There will be a short business meeting before the tryouts, during which the new girls may become acquainted with the rules and purpose of the club.The organization is made up of girls from Margaret Morrison and Art School and any. girl from either of the two schools is eligible for participation in its activities. Stringers embrace. any instrument at all such as violin, saxophone, uke, mandolin, traps and piano. It is probable that there will be quite a few interesting engagements if those of last year are any guarantee. The girls played at the Clan dinner held in a downtown hotel, at a benefit at ,the Irene Kaufman Settlement House and at numerous affairs about the campus, not to forget a joint program with the Glee Club. The club also  furnished music many times at noon for the enjoyment of the rest of the girls while they ^danced in the Rec Hall. Stringers has for its officers the following officers: President, Melba Sheppard; man-, ager, Madelin Ferguson; secretary, Eleanor Lemon. Any girl desiring additional information may obtain it by consulting any of the club officers.

Plebe Candidates Make 
Good; Managers Wanted
Again the freshmen are urged to try out for the Plebe football squad as well as football manager. Several freshme^i heeded last weeks request and reported,. made good, and have salted down births on the squad. There are plenty of positions open and the advantages of being on the squad justify lie reporting and working out of '-my ot those interested.
Contrary to orevious yea'rs,- there has been a small turnout of freshmen football managers. If 3rou can not play football the next sure way of gaining school prominence is to be a football manager. The varsity manager can use at least five plebes. The work is fairly light and lasts only during., football season. At the end of the junior year there are never more than two managers left and they are sure of the jobs.
Managers make all the trips, see all the games and gain a knowledge of school activities and notables which, can not be obtained any place' else on the campus. Those first year men who care the least for activities should report any afternoon at the field house.

Collegiate Imps to Furnish 
MusicAll Students In
vited to Attend
Sponsored by the Cawiegic Athletic Association, the second football dance of the season will take place in the Union Saturday, October 13, at nine oclock. The Collegiate Imps, an eight-piece orchestra, have been secured to furnish the evening's lhusic.. The* Imps met with favorable comment by newcomers to the football dance held last Saturday evening. To the old-comers this last dance was a revival of the annual custom of .football frolics'' on the Carnegie Campus after each game.Football dances have become a tradition at; Carnegie. After a bleacher session during the struggle between the foes and the Tartans, the Carnegie fans, students, and enthusiasts, desire to show their approval by some sort of celebration for the coaches and the team.
The football dances serve this purpose and have become. an in- creasingly popular source of Saturday night pleasure. Freshmen are especially urged to attend these dances as they will find it an opportunity to become acquainted with their football heroes and lo also see them in social action. They, need not fear any molestation ifrom the Sophomores - as all regulations are disregarded at Football Dances. A special effort has been made this year to secure larger and better, high, standard, collegiate orchestras.
This.year the football dances will be held in the Union after every home game and on the open . Saturday evening preceding the Georgetown University game. Dances will be held on the Saturday nights of October 13, 20, 27; November 3 and 24.
__ Admission to the dances is not limited but open to all Carnegie students. Friends of students, as well as of the faculty and the team are included in the general invitation which Carnegie Tech extends in the celebration. The admission fee is $1.50 per. couple.
ANNOUNCEMENT
Delays in the development of the Campus Pictorial by the organization sponsoring this new feature for college newspapers have made it necessary to postpone the ap- pearance_of the rotogravure picture section in The. Tartan until the -latter .part of this month. It is expected, however, that within a few weeks the new section will be available to Carnegie students, and indulgence is requested, for the delays and inconveniences accompanying its introduction. It 'has been found necessary to continue th large size, eight-column page in The Tartan, inasmuch as the pictorial section is to be 'of that size. It wrould be quite impractical to attempt to fold the larger picture section within the smaller news pages. From all present* advices the first rotogravure section will consist of four pages, and will appear on October 16. In . subsequent issues the size of the section will vary from four to eight pages.
Through this present issue of The. Tartan contains eight pages, no promise to continue such volume is implied. But even with a six-page issue such as the first two of this year, The Tartan is actually larger than the six-column eight- page issues of last year. The number of columns is the same, but in the present size, which conforms with-- standard newspaper practice, the columns are each several inches longer, -giving space for much more material .on each page.In any ca^e, however, the staff will continue to give Carnegie the best possible w'eekly newspaper. And it will always be on time!
The average age of the heavyweight champions of the world at the time they lost their titles was 33 years.
University Women to Con
vene at Margaret Morrison 
to Plan Million Dollar 
Travel Fund
The Association Maintains Luxurious Homes Abroad for Members Use En Tour
Margaret Morrison will be the scene of the biennial meeting of the Pennsylvania and Delaware Division of the American Association of University Women early in February. The chief purpose of thd meeting will be to consider ways of raising a million dollar fund for fellowships abroad for college women who have obtained the Ph.D. degree. Dr. Agues L. Rodgers, Professor of Education at Bryn Mawr College, who is chairman of the Committee on Fellowships of the association, has been invited to make the principal address.The biennial meeting will be held in the Margaret Morrison . College, with Director Breed acting as hostess. Sessions will meet in tlie Asscmb|y Hall. Further details, 
such as the speakers, programs and activities, will be announced later.
The International Federzftion of University Women is composed of associations of college women representing about 20 countries, of 
which the United States is, one. The headquarters of the federation is in London, while the central office of the American association is located in Washington, D. C.The American association maintains luxurious homes in the principal citie? of Europe,
The first General Assembly of the 1928 school year will be held in Carnegie Music Hall at 11:30 this morning. An ambitious program has been arranged by the Student Council as its initial offering to the student body.
The program will be opened with an address by Bob Waddell, assistant football coach. Bob, always a popular talker, will have some matters of particular interest to impart to his listeners. The football team and its chances for a successful seasQti will be the central theme of his talk.
Mr. Waddell will be followed by Mr. Dashbach and Mr. Laughlin, who will present a short act. These two performers, who are well remembered from last year when their humorous antics had the audience in convulsions of laughter most of the time, arc reported better than ever this year. Their act tomorrow promises to be one of the most amusing skits evcV cen at a Carnegie gathering.
The Assembly today will be the means of introducing to students an orchestra newly organized on the campus and called the Plaid Night-Hawks. The orchestra will play several popular selections, which will give students their first opportunity to. pass judgment on the new group of musicians.
Following the tradition, the Assembly will be concluded by the singing of Carnegie's Alma Mater.
It is the request of the social committee of the Student Council that as many students as possible attend General Assembly. The programs are, always interesting and amusing, and are certainly wcii worth tlie effort required to Avallc to the Music Hall. Moreover the General Assembly, which is held only once a month, presents important opportunity of fostering scliool spirit and good fellowship among the students.
So iinportant a factor in developing school spirit and a knpwledge of Carnegies ideals and traditions is General Assembly considered,, that' for years it has been the cu.^' tom, not only to urge, but'to insist that every Freshman attend each' Assembly. Neither men nor women are exempt, and a close watch on the plebe attendance is kept. Mr. Drew and Mr. Mansfield, with their committees from the class of '31, will be on hand lo check the1 attendance. Absence from an Assembly is sufficient: basis for a summons ' to Plebe Trial, and the punishments for. fail-/where any1college woman who is a paid-up - - -..........member of tlie organization and' | ft to attend, are of a seventy that ho is studying abroad, may  n'"'''"cr'nn'  - -~ .............
side. The advantages of this serv
ice make it desirable that ones Alma Mater belong to the association, $nd it is indeed fortunate' that 
Margaret Morrison women can take advantage of opportunities usually offered Lo strictly academic 
schools alone.Rigid requirements are adhered 
to in admitting colleges to the American . Association of University Women. Such high standards of scholarship and liberal arts requirements are maintained that few technical schools are admitted. Dean Breed, director of Margaret Morrison, has tried to gain admittance for Margaret Morrison since 19,12. By changing the courses in 
the Secretarial and Household Economic Departments, making them more liberal-in their academic requirements, Director Breed finally succeeded in having Margaret Morrison admitted to membership in 1925. The Fine Arts women are r ot included in the association because of the highly technical nature of their work. The only other non-academic college belonging lo the association is Simmons, in Boston.
corresponds with the seriousness , of the offense. The Margaret Morrison giVls will meet in the front hall of Margaret Morrison and march down to the Music Hall in / a body, accompanied'by energetic, sophomores. The role of Ajts 
school freshmen girls will be takeri at the Hall by members of the Plebe Regulation Committee of that school.
Gifts Made To Carnegie 
Aid Endowment Fund
The Carnegie Institute of Technology has been the recipient of two gifts,.one of which has helped enormously to increase the amount of the Carnegie Endowment Fund.
The first has been given by the Student Council of Night School which has presented the Endowment Fund with the votal balance of the Night School Breakage Fund amounting to $725.65. ' This gift is really presented by each individual member of the Carnegie Tech Night School.. The second gift was that of Mrs. John L. Porter who gave $2,500, the income of which is to provide for the Mrs. John L. Porter Prizes for Progress. It amounts to $100 and is given annually to a student in the Department of Painting and Decoration.Mr. John L.

As The Time For The Second Homecoming Approaches 
Plans Near Completion; Changes Made 
in Schedule.
The first day of the Second Annual Hoinccoming will soon be here. This thought alone should be enough to make any old Carnegie Grad feel glad. Only about two more weeks to the biggest event ever to be held by the Alumni of Carnegie. Never before has such preparation been made for a purely Alumni affair. Two days packed with everything necessary to make an alumnus completely happy. Nothing in the wide world should keep any Carnegie man or woman from attending this, the worlds greatest and largest Alumni Homecoming. If you think that the last statement is exaggerated come back and sec for yourself; wc arc sure that no  one will be disappointed. In fact, they will come back for more, next year.
Now that we have convinced you that this occasion is one which you can not miss, we Svill tell you the plans as completely as they have been developed by the various committees, up to the present time. Of course the schedule, like that of the Pennsylvania Railroad, is subject to change without notice. Each -alumnus and each alumna has. by this, time received postal carols, tickcts and notices, all of which contained tentative schedules of events but here is'the one which we believe will be final.
On Friday, October 26, the first day ofi. the Homecoming:11:00 A. M.Alumni Federation Meeting . in Trophy Room, Gymnasium.1:00 P. M,Buffet Luncheon in the Field House (Athletic Quarters), Dr. Bakers.Luncheon for 
the Class of 1908, in his officc.2:30 P. M.Inspection of Buildings and Grounds.3:30- P. M.Open House by tlie Administration and Faculty.7:00 P. M.Cabaret Dinner Dance at Webster Hall.On Saturday, October 27:10:30 A. MiReunion Classes will place in the floor of t h e Administration Building, bronze plates .impressed with their class numerals.  12:00 M. Class Reunions and, Luncheons.1:00 P. MiFootball, Pitt and Carnegie ljrcshman game at Stadium..2:30 P. M.Football, Pitt and Car- l negie. (Varsity game).6:00 P. M.Open House at all Fraternities,8:30 P. M.Football Dance in the Union.On Sunday, October 28:At Home'All Fraternities.Doesn't this lbok like enough to keep anyone Jmsy for a few days at 'least? As never before, each and Very event is entirely for the tastes of the Alumni. Add to all this the pleasure to be derived from meeting your old classmates 
and professors. Jim( your old chum; Mary, your first sweetheart; and last, but , not least, Professor Gecklcr who help 'you through the Math coursein five' years.Perhaps your class is- one of those that will hold its reunion at this time. The class' of 1908 will hold its' twentieth reunion; the class., of 1913, its fifteenth; the 
class of 1918, its tenth; tlife class of 1923, its fifth reunion;, and the class of 1928 will hold its first reunion. Arrangements have been made by the class committees and 
the- representatives of the various classes have the tickets for the reunion dinners which they will mail to the members of their respective-classes. If you arc a niem-v ber of one of these classes be sure rto attend your class reunion for it only comes once every five years and you never know what youll, be doing five years hence. Please remember that we are not trying to be pessimistic* we are merely trying to increase attendance at reunions.Somewhere else on this page is an article which refers to President Bakers invitation to the class of 1908.Fridays big event is the Cabaret Dinner Dance. This has been the only major change in last year's, program. A great amount of time had. been given to this event in an attempt to make it the most important affair in, the program. Two committees have worked upon this problem and as it has been arranged by_ them it should be an overwhelming success. The dance is to be at Webster Hall, in the main dining room with adjoining rooms if necessary. However there will be room for every alumnus that ever graduated from Carnegie. Dinner will be served at 7 p. m. The tickcts cost $2.50 per plate. The dance music will be furnished by the  Collegiate Ilnps and the entertainment will be furnished by the Old Collegiate Six. Due to the length of time since disorganization only seven of the boys will be back to amuse you and play the old tunes. Remember that the dance will be informal. Fill in the blank which is at the top of this article and send it in to Miss Andrews in the Gym. Dont wait 
too long to make reservations for the Cabaret Dinner Dance and that goes twice for the tickets to the Pitt Game.Saturday morning', a new ceremony will be installed by the reunion classes. In the floor of the Administration Building, between the Registrars and the Cashiers office, each reunion class will place a bronze plate with its class nunier-.j a Is on the plate. In the center of |
the floor will be placed the plate of the class of 1908. On it will be inscribedCharter Class 1908. This plate will be the largest of them all. At each corner of the larger plate will be a small plate for each of the other classes haying their reunions. Each year at the Homecoming the# classes that are having their reunions will add their plates to the others on the floor. The other plates will lie on the diagonals running, from the corners of the central plate. This will be accompanied by imposing ceremony. After this the class reunions will be held by the .classes, the details to be announced later.
The main reason why the Homecoming is to be at this time is known by all. ;Nothine could bring them back in droves like the old Pitt Game. And this year you will have an added incentive. Aside from the game, which you would, have attended regardless, there will be all these other events. This Department is not connected in an., way with the Athletic Depart-, mentj however wc can fell you, this much: The Pitt-CarricgieGame has always been a big game, always hard fought, always close enough to be ^supremely interesting and the 1 outcome has always been awaited anxiously by hundreds, nay, by thousands. Education and even business in the Pittsburgh district is disrupted before - and after this important occasion; before in preparation, and afterwards in celebration-- or dejection.- Cant you remember how happy and exultant, you were when we defeated' Pitt? Of course it was necessary to graduate after 1922 in order to experience this sensation. Pitt has won two of the last five g^mes. That is, since relations were resumed in 1923. Wc feel sure that at the end of this .season Pitt will still have won two games since 1923: On the other hand,;, ourfriends up on the hill' may be of a different opinion. But that is what makes the game interesting, and. brings the grads back year.'after year. No matter what the relation between the two teams is'; it will always remain The Game, especially to those alumni who saw their team lose, year after year,1 but never lost their Old Carnegie Fighting Spirit!
The lickct blanks which '-were mail.ed to all alumni should he fiUcd in and sent to the Graduate Managers Office. There will be a very  large, in fact too large a demand for tickets so to secure seats for the game you should mail your- check immediately.. Good seats are pretty scarce the day before the game. The paid up alumni gets first choice; alumni who have not paid up their dues., get second choice; and the general public 
comes last, which is as it should be.As yet there is no real indication of. .how many will return for the Second Annual Alumni Homecoming^ It is really the first Home- coming on a large scale and as-'it has no precedent no one knows just what to expect. However it is merely an 'accumulation: of the best alumni features during the previous years. The Alumni Office has, however, received letters from a, good number of the alumni signifying1'their intention., to att nd the Annual Homecoming. Soma1 of those who will be. back are: O. A.Dickman, I; M. A. Buck}.-/, F24j T^asdalc Barney, A24; Doc. Stewart; Al Schellinger; John Protrowski, I; H. Moershf,elder, I, 24; Rube Hedlurcf, E, 22; Skinny Humbert, 'E24; Til lie" Til- brook, E15; Doc. Taylor; Ted Rcpplier, I23.
Write to the Alumni Office and tell Miss Andrews- that you intend to come back, to school--- on the 26th ancL27th of October, enclosing your ticket blank for the Cabaret Dinner Dance.. She -will be glad, to give* you any information which you can not .find in the Tartan or the Alumnus. Only .one. more issue of the Tartan will reach your office before.tlie Homecoming unless you live near school. So next weeks issue will contain the final plans and schedule. Everyone will enjoy the occasion more if he comes back knowing just what is going to happen and what he must attend. Be sure to read all the dope between now and the 26th.

NOTICE, CHARLEROIThe Macbeth-Evans Glass company of Charleroi has at least 12 Carnegie alumni in its employ, according to reports received here.The general manager, Mr. Blau; the business manager, physicist, illuminating engineer, and others ar^ all former Carnegie men, and it seems, with so many graduates holding such prominent positions 
in the same firm that it should be only natural to have a successful Charleroi Clan. But as yet thereis not even evidence of an attempt at such aii. organization.Show some spirit, grads, organize'your clan. Ten is the minimum number considered in clan formation, and you have 12 in yourcompany alone. Get your men together aiid look up any others inCharleroi and the surrounding dis-1 tricts. Miss Andrews can help you locate them if you wish this service. Elect your president, secretary and treasurer; draw up your 
by-laws; show some spirit and action, and send your news in to the Tartan.
Carnegie Alumni Should 
Get Introductory Cards
To the various hotels co-operating with the Intercollegiate Alumni Hotel' Plan, Miss Andrews, Alumni Secretary, has sent tlie 
name's and addresses of Carnegie Tech graduates. In connection fyitli this there are introduction cards which each alumniis should have/ The introduction cards are of a decided advantage to the alumni. Who carry them because they / establish personal contact between the traveler and the manager of the hotel. This card also signifies that the person having it is entitled to special courtesy and attention accordcd to guests of Intercollegiate Alumni Hotels. Therefore, Miss Andrews urges that each graduate send in for one of the Introductory Gards.The following is a list- of hotels who are members of the Intercollegiate Hotel- Plan:Southern, Baltimore, Md.Claremont, Berkeley, Calif.Bethlehem, Bethlehem, Pa.Bellevue, Boston, Mass.Blackstone, Chicago, 111.Allertou House, Chicago, \ 111.Windermere, Chicago, 11).Allerton House, Cleveland, O.Neil House, Columbus, O.Californian, Fresno, -Calif.Muchlebach, Kansas City, Mo.Ij,incoln, Lincoln, Neb.Biltmore, Los Angeles, Calif.Park, Madison, VVis.Nicollet, Minneapolis, Minn.Mount Royal, Montreal, Can.Monteleone, New Orleans, La.Roosevelt, New York, N.

The story goes that several college presidents were discussing what they would do after they re
tired. What would they be fit for, was the question.
Well, said one of them, *I dont know that Id be fit for anything, but I know what Id like to do. Id like to be superintendent of an-, orphan asylum so Id,never get any letters from parents.
Ive a much better ambition, exclaimed another. I want to be 
warden of a penitentiary. The alumni never,'come back to visit.
Now that we are coming more and more to admit that education must continue throughout life, the colleges and universities must do more in the direction of continuing the education of their alumni, so we arc reminded by Daniel L. Grant, director of an investigation of educational relations between colleges and alumni. He recalls that -many other relationships bc- ween the colleges and their alumni have become well known, such as the social, the political, the financial, and the athletic; but that the educational relation has been neglected. The old slogan was, lie says, What can we do for Alma Mater, but now the movement is rather in the direction of Alma Mater doing something for the alumni.
Most of the confusion in .the present college course is due to the effort to crowd too much into the four years, thinks Mr. Grant. Why not let some of it run over into the alumni year?
The results of Mr. Grants survey shows that there are about 50 colleges and universities now in the country which have recognized that there is a real educational obligation which they have to their alumni, and are setting out to meet this . need. The first in the field was Amherst (1923). Michigan and her Alumni University idea is one 'of the latest, and certainly the most discussed of any such movement.
What are the educational demands which these 50 colleges are trying to supply their alumni, and how is the work being done?
Perhaps the first is professional guidance and education. Next is cultural education. The third is education to deal intelligently with the large issues of :comnion concern.
These three kinds of alumni edu
cation are being carried on by means of reading courses, reading lists, and a readers adviser service,' supplemented by books from the college library, whereveri the alumnus is , out of reach of any adequate local library. Smith College; for instance, has organized more, than twenty different reading -courses, and for each of the past four years has matriculated from about sixteen lo , twenty per c.ent of its total alumnae in some of these courses.
There is, however, one significant limitation, Mr. Grant points out, a limitation which grows out of the narrow institutional outlook of organized alumni work in the past. This in turn is prbbably very largely a product of intercollegiate athletic competition which has given us .an institutional complex.. He believes that an alumnus of a college in. Maine Who lives in California will get educational beUcfit more easily from the California colleges, regardless of how superior alma mater may have seemed to all other educational institutions in the country. In this continuing- cducation-for-the-educatcd wc have a work which is going to cut across institutional lines ratlier liberally.
MISS ELIZABETH HAYESMiss Elizabeth Hayes, of the Steubenville road, has been appointed instructor of Home Economics in the Cambridge public schools.Miss Hayes was a member of the 1923 graduating class of Brown High school and graduated from Carnegie Institute of Tcchnology, at Pittsburgh, June, 192S, where she studied largely, in the fielcfc of textiles; costume designing and other branches of home economics. She will co-opcrate with Miss White, instructor of Home Economics at Brown High school, and will spend part of .'her time among the grade students.The vocational department of the Cambridge schools has., increased greatly in the last few years. The. employment of Miss Hayes increases the total of teachers in the department to six, three teaching manual training and three teaching home economics. 
The teachers arc, handicapped by the lack of proper facilities, many students being unable to take the subjects. Several high school boys are forced to go to _the Garfield building to receive instruction.Manual training and home economics are listed upon the curriculum for the general course at the high school and the work done in these subjects is not additional, but counts in the 16 units required for graduation.

PRESIDENT BAKER TO GIVE 
LUNCHEON FOR CLASS OF '03
To the Class of 190S, including their wives and husbands, President Baker has extended a luncheon invitation during the Sccond Annual Alumni Homecoming. The lunch will be given Friday, October 26, at 12 oclock, in the Administration Building.
To all others a buffet lunch will be served in the Field House. This applies to  both men and women. There will be an opportunity to inspect the training quarters after lunch.
1908 was the first graduating class and is composed of Science and Arts only. There are fifty- six or seven alumni in this class, and it is hoped that they will all attend the lunch to be given for them.
As reunions arc held in the first, fifth, tenth, fifteenth, and twentieth years, this is the year for the re-, unions of the classes of 190S, 1913, 1918, 1923, 1928. Jt is hoped that they will all have the greatest reunion that they have ever had.

Students who labored in Americas industries during the summer will meet in October to digest and compare their excursions into the life of labor. One conference is to be held at Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana, on October 19; another at Brookwood Labor College, at Katonah, New York, on the twenty-eighth. The conferences are being held by a group of co-operating organizations, under the leadership of James Myers of the Federal Council of 
Churches of America.Geographically this movement of students into industry covered the principal cities from New . York to Denver and from the Great Lakes to the Rio Grande while physically and mentally it ran the gamut of the experiences of those who work with their hands. Job-hunting was one of the rnost vivid experiences of all the students, for unemployment is prevalent everywhere. At Houston the students worked at three different jobs in as many weeks. And when jobs were found they were not of the best. In Houston one boy was held at his work, without a pause for supper, until one oclock in the morning. A girl fainted after a few hours labor jn a laundry. Another worked 19 days without a day of rest. In the Ford 'factory a student found the speeding up process almost unbearable. Nor did lie relish the 15-minute period alloted for lunch.In Detroit the largest group was at work. It was composed- of 50 students from 19 colleges and universities. Wherever the students worked they always sought to meet with their fellows periodically to report on their work and compare observations.What this unique method of studying American industry at first hand means to those who participate is revealed by Arthur P. Clow, Dartmouth 29: "Its educationalcontribution is important. It is a practical course in the realities of life and has not been limited in its, scope. Psychology becomes related to certain cases to be studied. Sociology, of course, becomes more real when one is thrown so closely into contact with the problems which one finds in tcxt-books. I might go on through the various subjects studied in college and show how this experience in the Bowery is giving*me a new slant on each.
University of Texas.As an insurance Lhat blanket .tax athletic tickets will not be transferred, the University of Texas athletic council has arranged a method whereby the picture of each student paying for a blanket tax will be placed on his athletic ticket.This action was forced by the persistence of students in other years in allowing their friends and roommates who had not paid for blanket taxes to attend games they themselves were unable to attend.It was also necessary to devise some means of preventing scalping of rooting section tickets for big games, a practice which tended t,o destroy the effectiveness of the section.The University of Texas blanket' tax saves the students $65 in campus expenses throughout the year.

A Forgotten Art
In these days of Glynn and Del- mar, we are very apt to forget those things that made life endurable for our never to be forgotten ancestors, and among the most toglected of these little details is the art -of fencing. But if one would only spare the time to peruse a history of not only fencing, but the entire story of* the evolution of swords and sword-fighting he 
would find that this particular branch of research would reveal more interesting bits of history than a more prosaic historical treatise on world affairs.
While most of the uninitiated believe that any type oj swordplay is fencing, it is a well known fact that true skill in this line was. not developed untiP the advent of the rapier which was designed by the Italians and* Spaniards. These races chiefly lived on the bounty won by their skill and valor in this line of work.
Although the knife, and its elongated brother/ the^ sword has existed among men as long as man in his present form or rather his more civilized form has roamed the earth, sword-fighting as an art has long been held back by mans lack of knowledge in treating metals so that they could withstand the rough treatment accorded side-arms.
Practically the whole time from the dawn of civilization to the Medieval times, the sword rarely if ever, exceeded the length of eighteen inches or tvent-four at the most. In fact, the Romans made themselves rulers of theworld with blades of the almost insignificant length of ten inches. But as perhaps you know, or at least can realize, there is no dexterity required to stand a footaway from the enemy and strike him down with such a weapon. It was more a matter of speed than anything else, for that which is true in most things, namely, the one who strikes the quickest and hardest is the winner of all of his encounters.
But with the advent of theknights who worp heavy armor and mounted themselves on suitable steeds, the footmen - found themselves handicapped by the fact that it was necessary to lean far out in -th.e saddle to strike with such a short weapon. And even if he should be sufficiently fortunate to force a blow through, he found that these light blades made little if any impression on the armor.
These difficulties brought about the invention of the two-handed swords, which -were merely heavy bars of iron, fitted with a suitable grip, intended to crush the protecting plates of the opponent. But again an embarrassing problem arose, for only the stronger of the 
men-at-arms could wield such massive bludgeons. But thci.r advantages were too great to cause their abandonment and the leaders of the nations consoled themselves with gathering about themselves the strongest and most -incorrigible ruffians they could cull from the scums of their cities in order that these weapons' could be effectively used.
But at last the end was reached. Poictiers and Grccy proved to the world that plate clad cavalry was not as invincible as had been supposed and the' foot soldier at last came into his own. The bowmen remained for a long time the backbone of the military organization; but the members of the better classes, those who could afford the 
huge expense engendered by enlisting the services of a foreigner who had learned the use of lighter types of blades, were loath to be armed in the same manner as people/less fortunate. As a result the sword, the rapier, the dagger, the foil and sabre were developed in rapid suocession.
Naturally, each style had its adherents and soon it became apparent that certain types were more adapted to military uses than the others. The Spanish' became famous at rapier play, the English at straight swords, the stolid Teuton for his methodical style with any type of play, and the Frenchman for his versatility and ease for developing the mere act of quarreling with new weapons.lifter the passing of what was termed open style> the different -methods of using the steel were noted to dwindling until only the two great divisions that still remain in use totlay were left, i. e., the French style and the Spanish style;
The basic difference between these two lies in the manner of attack. The Frenchman depends on bis skill and craft to be^t his adversary, while the Italian is a strong advocate -of strength and brute force to enable him to crush his opponent at a single stroke if possible. Many and varied are the supporters of each style and- there have been numerous encounters to prove the worth of each- style. While neither side has gained any advantage through this needless bloodshed, we moderns arc very apt to choose the French style for reasons quite apparent.While Jt is all in the point of view, it is believed that the public sentiment is voiced in the remark that a Hercules is required to* make an Italian fencer while a woman can rise to marvelous proficiency under the French method.

Oh, boy, did you see that line  last week. It looked like all the people in Pittsburgh and vicinity had decided to go to night school. No foolin'' it was the biggest mob that I have ever seei> on registration,_night and it sorta worried me as to where they intended putting them all. But just wait until January and then there will be plenty of room again. It made the old heart beat a lot faster to see many of the old gang back again and they, certainly looked as fit as fiddles'. Even some of the professors still remembered me, but how could they do otherwise. If you tried to teach me as some of them have, you wouldnt forget in a hurry. One of my cliem. profs used to dread the time when I went to the laboratory as lie was always, looking for the whole darn school to blow up judging from the way theapparatus was handled, but it wasnt, so Id rather not hear anymore about that.To the new students, permit to remind them, that they were given hand books when they registered. Now these books were not -'primarily intended to be taken home and given to the baby,_or lost, or used solely for the telephone num- | bers of the dates, but instead were handed to you in order that you may familiarize yourself' with the ways of Carnegie. Read it through carefully and then you will realize more fully the responsibility you have assumed by identifying yourself with the night school. Learn 
the songs and yells and dont be \ifraid to use them when the. time comes. If you can't sing, do it 
anyhow. Nobody else is trying to ^ing anyhow so whats1 the difference; but know the words, and make all the noise you can.
Have just been informed that the night students are eligible for practically any of the dances on 
the campus. This includes , the formal as well as the informal affairs. There is one point though 
in connection with the formal affairs and that is you must -have been on the campus several years and also that you confer with some one on the committee beforehand. Now that this question is settled hope that all you fellows who have 
been wondering . whether or not you could get in, will start going. That reminds me of the last time
The great cathedral of Cologne, in Germany, which was begun in 124S, was completely neglected from the fifteenth century until 1S23. It was finally completed in 18S0, niorc than six centuries after it was sUi.rJSii

I tried to step out formally. No j 1 won't tell it because it was too . pitiful to behold much less telling.Well, Gang, the old frost is on the pumpkin again so that means football. Is there anything sweeter | than a nice clear, cool day in the j early autumn and sitting out there | with the stands reflecting every j 
color of the rainbow, the band i promenading the field, the, latecomers hurrying to their .seats, the yells and cheers, the incessant chat- | ter of those discussing the teams prospects and then - the players trotting into the enclosure, the 
toss-up, the players lining up and then tlie whistle. Oh, boy, what a thrill. You sit there on needles arid pins hoping that no one
iumbies, that the next play carries' the ball over the necessary yardage to make another first down and maybe they do and maybe they dont, but whichever the case may L>e you get a thrill anyhow. And then your team works the balldown toward the others goal line
I and then how you pray for a j touchdown. Perhaps you never 
| knew you could pray before. And 
j then one of the backs starts around I r-u. end and just manages to get | over the line. Immediately the
j tension cases up and all you can I do is yell ,and yell some more joure so excited. Of course, your 
; team doesnt always win and then you may feel somewhat downhearted, but even at that you always have the, satisfaction of knowing that they gave their best, but that their best was not quite good enough. Boys, if you really want a real . sensation get yourself a ticket and go out to see this years 
team. From all reports it must be a. world-beater and it seems about the least that we can do is to go out and root for them and show them that we are with them. So lets have some spirit at these football games from the night students. Lets go.
Did you notice the boys with guns when you registered? Well, in case you dont know, they belong to the R. O. T. C. They certainly look nice in their uniforms and it is a pity that we dont have an opportunity to sec more of them. Sorta brings back memories of the time when bands played and footsteps tramped along the streets.

Student Book Shop Buys As 
Well As SellsDiscount Allowed Night StudentsFeature to Commence October 16th
The Student Book Shop in the Skibo Inn will be open in the evenings from 6:45 to 8:45 for the convenience of the night students. Second-hand books are sold at a discount and this is a good opportunity for you to save sonic money on your book's.
This- is the first year that this shop has existed, consequently the | supply of books is limited and should anyone desire to sell their old books, they may do so by taking them to the sliop where they will be purchased at half price, provided, of course, they are in good condition.Now heres your chance. Old books in the majority of- cases only clutter up the house and take up space needed for books of a different nature. The Book Shojj needs the books badly and you need the space so why iTCt bring them out as soon as you can because the big rush is on and a couple of days, delay will make all the difference in the world. So lets get those old books into the book shop.
Chewing gum, be it observed, is an ancient and respectable practice, probably indulged in by the venerable Incas as well as the old civilization of the Orient. Beheading also was an accepted custom in those days. Now it is predicted that if gum chewing persists at such functions as the Chancellors reception, the head-chop- pcrs art might justifiably return to full flower. Not that anyone 
should object to conversing with someone whose jaws arc otherwise occupied. Nor that we dis
like to park newly-pressed trousers on an area already used by cast-off gum. Far from it. But we cant bear to think of anyone strangling or, gum and punch.Daily Kansas.
In past years the day students 
were allowed a slight discount at 
the theaters owned by the StanleyClark-Davis Company. Through 
the efforts of \Mr. Siebcrt, this privilege has been extended to the night students.
There will be a reduction of from ten to thirty per ccnt on tickets purchased for any of the shows operated by the above firm.In order to permit the night men to take advantage of this offer, arrangements have been made for their distribution from Room 12 in the Industries building, on Wednesday evenings, from 7 to 7:30.All that is required is your registration card, so be sure to bring it along with you. This distribution will continue at the same time and the same place as long as 
there is a demand for them. If you are a frequent visitor at the movies, you may, as well avail yourself of this privilege.
Ginger is the oldest spice known. Gingerbread cakes in the shape of dolls, horses, and other objects, have been made for the amusement of children since the Middle Ages.
The new Rotogravure scction 
\yill be incorporated in the issue 
of October 16, so you all want to be on the lookout for this new feature. This publication is one ol the largest subscribers and wc know hat you will enjoy reading this page.
Incidentally, the TARTAN wil! buy any pictures that arc out oi tl. - ordinary and yet have to dc with anything interesting on the Campus. But it must concern Carnegie and be unique, so lets set what you night men can do in this line.

ANNOUNCING
POWER OF QUIETNESS) One For The Plumbers
Think for a minute of all the people you know. Put them in two classes; the noisy, boisterous, voluble folk and the quiet, calm, placid ones. Which kind would you prefer to spend most of your time with? The latter, of course. As far as getting things done is concerned at the end of the day which class has accomplished the more. Invariably the latter.
Picture yourself a customer and enter with me a department where a lot of unnecessary loud talking is going on among the employees. A distinctly unfavorable impression is made upon your mind at once. Is it not so? Again go with me to a business office where every one and everything moves quietly and systematically. Docs not such an organization command your respect at once?
Reflect with me* about the most forceful forces of nature. Do they not operate quietly?Thunder, booms with the noise of a thousand cannons, but it is the silent lightning which possesses power. ^he sun, on which all life, on this planet depends1, operates without suggestion of noise.The electric current, the modern miracle worker of miracle workers, indulges is no screeching.'That mysterious thing which wc call time keeps on the even tenor of its , way as frequently as the motionless air.It is only the surface of the sea that ever becomes tumultuous; the depths are as silent as the grave. Individuals, institutions, nature, all prove for us the power of quietness.
Dont be secretive, sphinx-like, that is worse, much worse than being noisy and voluble. But if you would be truly companionable and most efficient, be quiet.Try to acquire the reputation of a quiet person if you would be a forceful person.
DISCOUNTS ON GASOLINE AND OIL OPENTO STUDENTS
The Faculty Welfare Committee has recently announced that the students of Carnegie may now pur- chase gasoline and oil1 at a special discount. A well-known gasoline station on North Craig street has agreed to sell Atlantic Gasoline at a discount of 2 cents on a gallon and Mobile Oil or Quakerstate Oil at a discount of 5 cents on a quart. Judging .from the number of student cars on the campus this should be a welcome announcement. Cards enabling the students to obtain this discount may be secured upon presentation of their auto registration 
license to Professor K. D.. Schaffer, Room 210, Administration Hall. Mr. Schaffer has only a limited supply of these cards and it would be best to apply for them immediately at his office. .

THISTLE
At Last Some Enlightenment
Many complaints were voiced as regards the delivery of last year-s Thistle. Apparently, time was lost in gathering the material, which, of course, held up the whole line. Consequently, the bo^k was not issued until after graduation which was too late to permit the stu- di .its to have them before leaving school.We, of course, realize that the Thistle can not be finished in time tov distribute it among the night students before the clpse of the term, but, precaution should be exercised by those responsible to insure prompt delivery by mail in cases where the men are unable to call for them.
Those of you who subscribed last year and did not receive your copy up to the present time are requested to have a little more patience (like Job), and as soon as the flurry of registration has passed, arrangements will be made to enable you to get your copy at the earliest possible date.
As a geeral thing a complex is regarded as a bad thing. One who thinks himself or his work inferior to others, or to his work, begins 
the race with a heavy handicap. One who thinks himself or his work superior to all others of his work, is likely to encounter some dangerous head-on collisions.People will do themselves and their friends distinct service if they avoid both forms of complexes. If 
you have a vocation which develops an inferiority complex, change it as soon as you can. If one must have a complex, it is better to have the superiority com
plex, because one will get enough bumps to hold one in ones place, but when the complex is an inferiority one, it, is most unfortunate.. It discourages the spirit of service. It chokes idealism. It ! cripples education. It contravenes 
| 'he public welfare. It halts progress. It is Mrong.

Theta Tau Holds Meeting to 
Plan Program for This Year
The first meeting of Theta Tau, national professional engineering frternity, was held Thursday evening, October 4, in Room 53, Engineering Hall. It was decided that meetings of the fraternity should be held Wednesday evenings of alternate weeks at 7:30 in Professor Daniel's 'office, Room 53, Engineering Hall. The meetings will be, alternately, technical-social meetings and business meetings. Prominent outside speakers will address the fraternity on .subjects of interest at technical meeting's. These addresses will be followed by refreshments. The other meeting of the month will be a strictly business meeting.George M. Wile was elected vice president to succeed James Kucs- ter, who did not return to school. Wile is a Senior Civil, a member of the Sigma Nu social fraternity, and Tau Beta.Pi. scholastic honorary fraternity. He is also a member of the tennis squad.Mention was made of the fact that former Professor Steidle, an hofiorary member of the Carnegie chapter of Theta Tau, is now head of the Department of Mining, at 
Penn State.Refreshments were served following the meeting.
NORTHWESTERNUNIVERSITY
Sophs Start Plebes On 
Right Road To Education
The female of the species sleeps less and studies  more than the male, according to statistics- compiled at Northwestern University. These figures showed that the co-ed spends about* a third of a day on social activities of one kind 
o: another, including telephoning, accepting or rejecting dates, attending to correspondence, recrea
tion and talking.The .campus cd spends an equal amount of time in similar activi
ties.Keeping up Northwesterns repu
tation for feminine beauty takes up about two hours a day of the coeds time. But the students there consider this time well spent in considering the results that the 
girls obtain. She sleeps a little over a third of the 24 hours. The compilation showed that the co-eds studied about one-fourth of the day, departing to the reader that the members of the weaker sex arc not as frivolous and plastic ageish as they arc popularly supposed to 
be.
Last Friday the Plebes received their first lecture in The Life of a Plebe.' The title or reference to this course can not be found in the colleges curriculum; it, is a course given gratis to all freshmen through the generosity of the sophomores. The Jirst lecture was in the form of a trial which was screened by Kincogram News Reel camera man who came especially to our campus to show the world what kind of broad education the sophomores give to the poor, uneducated plebes. The pictures of 
last Friday's trial will be shown in Pittsburgh this week and whcrc- ever Kincogram News Reels arc 
shown. The scenes that were taken represent the characteristic 
method in which the plebes become oriented into the college. Ini. a few sccncs that will be shown, the world will see how kind the sophomores arc and how they feed the poor plebds who arc perhaps away from their mothers for the 
first time and do not know how tc cat properly, or how to respect the upperclassmen. A few plebes were shown how to propose- to girls and they seemed to learn readily the few fundamentals, which proves that sophomores arc very good teachers. Aesthetic dancing was also given, and the dancing of plebes compared very favorably to the dances that arc done on the present stage. During the taking of pictures one plebe became hungry and one of the plebes liad to get a bottle with which he gave the first plebe the proper nourishment. All plebes who regret that they were not present at the taking of. pictures and missed the first lecture will be enabled to take a supplementary lecture this coming 
Thursday.
Oberlin.Oberlin college has purchased several hundred acres of land on the Vermilion River, a few miles north - of here, which is to be used exclusively for a hunting, fishing and camping grounds for t!. - male students of the college.The purchase of the land followed on the heels of a movement started here several years a' o and brought to a head just recently, to repudiate the traditional rumor that Oberlin is a "womens col
lege.The men of the college had complained that they had insufficient mens life, and the purchase of the tract was, the answer of the college trustees to the complaint.

PLAN TO RELEASE 1929THISTLE ABOUT MAY 1
Bound in an attractive red color by Kegan Paul, London publishers, and also issued by Brcntanos of New York, Dr. Nathan Millers book, "The Child in Primitive Society, makes its appearance in the field qf educational psychol
ogy.Dr. Miller is Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at Carnegie Tech. He has been working on this book for several years and revised' it for publication this spring.Dr. Miller, in his introduction, says that the child today is educated at the expense of his own individuality, to preserve, the institutions and opinions of his fathers. He then proceeds to show the origin of customs which have led to the use of the child for the good of the adult, instead of to the dedication of the child to his own self-expression.He begins with a chapter, Primitive Notions of the Child, in which Jic discusscs , the moves among primitive tribes of regarding the new-born child simply as another living thing, like any animal.
The chapter on "The Burden of Children describes the efforts of tribes to limit the number of children by abortion, infanticide or birth-control. The "Desire for Children" shows, in the main,that children were wanted, for the most part, because they were an economic" asset. Children were "a needful aid in the struggle, not usually for life itself, but that measure of worth and social prominence which is based .011 the possession of a superior abundance of material goods. "The . Name' and "Preliminary Orientation of the Child discuss the early 'efforts of parents to tie the child to themselves and to their, customs.
"Infancy and Childhood is con
cerned with treatment of the chil
dren in its earlier years, when it is watched carcfully and its progress noted. "At a very early age the child is put into the harness. Life is a struggle against great oddsand the child must therefore carry on for himself.
Dr. Miller takes primitive education, in the .forms of- imitation and suggestion, training the child, and the initiation into maturity, which lie discusscs in great detail, giving specific examples from various tribal sources.- 
After a discussion of inheritance and succession, and social forces, Dr. Miller says: "In many waysthe child and the youth is still exposed to the primitive view that he is the perpetuating .organ of this institutional myth or that antiquated cult. And it is by inculcating a conforming allegiance that these aims, half-understood even by the orthodox educationalists themselves, can be securcd. Inthe light of reason, at least, it is time that this pressure making for conformity and perpetuation ofoutworn symbols should be replaced by a desire to allow the child to express himself and perpetuate himself by the development of his individuality. Education is only a means to an end. In the past it has been used more or less consciously as the vehicle bywhich the elders or the privileged have perpetuated their hold through conventional fictions. Perhaps it 
Avill be used in the future as an instrument by means of which the child may cnrich the culture of his age by the simultaneous development of his own life as well.The volume is well annotated and indexed. It may be securcd at all booksellers.
Radical New College 
System Started At 
Florida Institution
Definite Classes, Home Work, Quizes Abolished In Dr. Holts Scheme
If there is hope for an intellectual renaissance in the United States, one of its most promising signs is the zeal with which the college world is engaged in self-criticism. It is a poor college that is not trying, if very feebly, to follow some such trail as those blazed by Wilson at Princeton, Meiklejohn at Amherst and Wisconsin, Aydelottc at Swarthmorc, Morgan at Antioch, and Hamilton at Robert Brookings. The more venturesome of the many experimenters are not only hoping to reorganize the curriculum but arc also seeking to break through the routine of the time- honored lccturc-and-quiz methods of instruction. None perhaps has broken so completely with classroom tradition in this respect as has Rollins College at Winter Park, Florida, under the leadership of Hamilton Holt.
Briefly, Dr. Iiol.t proposed _ to banish * the lecture and recitation wholly from the campus, _ as the normal methods of instruction. He proposed to provide each department and instructor with a laboratory or workshop, equipped with the tools, books, and conveniences for study. Here it was hoped that students  and teachers would work together, the former learning especially from the contagion of common intellectual undertakings. It was a thoroughgoing application to the college\field of what is frequently called the; "project-method in discussions of secondary education.
"We would have continuous and intimate association of professors and students in the  working period of the day, declared President Holt. "Every student should spend the entire morning in intellectual work, two hours of the afternoon in field work, and perhaps ^n .hour or an hour and a half in the evening in receptive work (and play.In working out Dr. Holts ideals, several modifications were made at Rollins. The financial condition <pf the college made it impossible to put the plant in. ideal shape for the effective working of the plan in all its aspects. Instructors of national prestige entered their rooms at .the inauguration of the experiment two years ago to find some of them without a scrap of furniture. The floor and window- ledges were for a few weeks a very real equivalent of Mark Hop- kins hypothetical log. *Yet this' very lack of standardized equipment has helped to destroy the obstacles to natural, human contacts between students and instructors. And instruction has come t Rollins to be a matter of conference, suggestion, and guidance, with the student placed increasingly upon his own initiative and held responsible for results.Thus the student enrolling in chemistry may be handed a text and a book of exercises. Here is your years work; go to it, says the professor in effect. When you strike a snag, come into the office for a talk. When you are ready for a quiz, it will be ready for you. In a literature course, discussion by the Socratic method is the principal feature of the class period. One professor delivers abrief lecture embodying original material at each meeting of the class, and devotes the remainder of the period to individual conferences. Another divides his . class into sections for the purpose of making group reports to the class as a whole upon principal topics of discussion. In one history class recently the instructor devoted aportion of the period to individual conferences upon essays previously written, while the bulk of the class engaged in the preparation of another set of papers, with the aid of the departmental library. Presently half a dozen students were discovered on the veranda, heatedly arguing the reasons for the fall ofRome. The instructor joined thegroup, and ultimately the discussion attracted the attention of the
The 1929 Thistle board is completing arrangements for this year's edition of the book. The engraving contract has been let to the Canton Engraving and, Electrotype Company who did such excellent art work on last years edition. Edward Eberman and Mid. Young, graduates of the Printing and* Decorating Department, and Ralph Hitchcock, a senior in the depart: mcnt, are employed by the Canton company and they will, no doubt, do much of the art work.Tom Brown, editor of the Thistle, plans to have the book ready for distribution by May 1. To assure success of his plans, all subscriptions should be in as soon as possible. The subscription price is $4.50, of which $2 is paid at the time of subscribing and the balance on delivery. After February 20, the price^ will be raised to $5.The letting of the contracts for printing and photography as well as several new appointments arc expected to be announced soon.

entire class. In another course the instructor lectures informally when the students ddcidc ttyat they need encouragement or enlightenment with respect to a complicated situation. In the education department, customarily the stronghold of aridity and 'insipidity, the instructor has been approaching problems of educational psychology by>way of Plato and Dantes Inferno.Whatever Dr. Holt has started at Rollins, it is not a cut-and.-d.ncd system. .He has given able instructors who were dissatisfied with older methods an opportunity to experiment with more direct means of promoting the intellectual and aesthetic development of their students. And the admitted results have encouraged the indefinite continuance of the expcrir mcnt."What do you do when vyour class meets? I have been asked by anxious colleagues at other institutions. This is the precise dif
ference between Rollins and the average college. The class does not meet as such. Individuals come to the department room for reading and research, to make written or oral report, for conference with the instructor, to attend an announced discussion or lecture. If they do not come they must be 'accounted for. But they are selfstarters. The students decide for themselves how they will spend their time, unless they are deficient. When at rare intervals the instructor assumes, the role of taskmaster, the event is impressive for its novelty. It is not the duty of studcnts'to run if the instructor does not put in an appearance within ten minutes of the beginning of the period. They have their work cut out for them; and it is their loss if they do not do it when it can be best performed.It was not easy at the outset to bring students and teachers to realize the full implications of this sweeping break with time-honored college teaching methods. To assist the conference idea in making its way upon the. campus, a departure was instituted in the length of class periods. Instead of^ meeting for three, one-hour periods a week, classes, were scheduled for the same number of periods, two hours in length, for the same credit. It was assumed that college students, who are generally supposed  to study two hours in preparation for every hour spent in class, actually spend only one hour or less in preparation. Hence it was proposed that' students should perform all of their required activities in connection with any course during the two hours scheduled for contact with their instruc-' tors in the classroom, If they wished to excel, or to master their courses more rapidly than their fellows, they might do so after school hours-, in their rooms of elsewhere. The college day, however, was divided into three such 
conference periods, which, together with a period for athletics in the afternoon, were expected to j place the required activities of the school upon an "eight-hour business day.It must be said that this attempted analogy between college education and the New York business office has not been free from difficulties. Experienced educators have viewed it at all1 times with distrust, as based upon erroneous premises. The problems of attention involved have been solved at times at the expense of content in the courses. The organization of college work about th, average performance of the average stun dent as a standard is out of line with contemporary trends in progressive education. Moreover, the element of supervised study seemingly involved in the eight-hour day principle is at war with the conference ideal itself. And as the college attracts to it, as it is doing, the type of student best able to become master of his own education, this particular mechanism is certain to undergo considerable modification. It has already been abandoned in advanced courses, which arc Being run along seminar or autonomous lines. And in practice it is safe to say that there is not a student on the campus who actually performs all of his required college work, not to say all that, he is moved to do. within the strict, and exclusive limits of (Continued on Page 5)

TEXAS UNIVERSITY OXFORD ETIQUETTE
According to English newspapers Oxford University women students are committing shocking breaches of etiquette, by talking on the street to Oxford men students. This notice should discourage American women from studying at Oxford. For surely few American women could so revolutionize their lives as to abstain from talking on the streets to their gentlemen friends.The regulation against talking to men on the streets is, of course, manifestly absurd. It is the survival of a custom which was likely a necessary measure of pro
tection in earlier, rougher days. Now that the need has disappeared, the custom should follow. For now university menthough there arc 
specimens to the contrarygenerally are gentlemen.
Perhaps it is just as well that women arc not eligible to become P.hodos Scholars. For they \vould be miserable on the streets could they not converse with handsome young Englishmen.  S. M. U.

_ AT FIRST A. I.E. E. MEETINGCarnegie Aviation Club Will 
Have One Delegate at Yale 
Conference on Aeronautics
In the village o Tusca tot a, there is no public school be of the 50 inhabitants, none an than 20 years of age.- The first meeting of the Carnegie Student branch of the A. I. E. E. will be held Wednesday evening, Octobcr 10; in Room 11, Machinery Halj. The primary pur- i pose of this meeting is to make the students and faculty of Electrical Engineering acquainted with each other and to elect class representatives and appoint standing committees for the year. Professors Work and Dennisson, both of I he Electrical Department, will address the members on the purposes and the work of the A. I. E. E. The coming years policy 
FHYNT be outlined by G. M. Cooper, Chairman of the student branch. All new electrical students are asked to be present. Officers of the A. I. E. E. for the present year arc G. M. Cooper, chairman; A1. G. Scibol, vice chairman; H. G. Fcrick, secretary; O. V. Mitchell, treasurer.
Membership in the Aviation Club j is still open to all those interested in aviation. The dues arc $1.50 for initiation which includes the purchase cli the pin. Twenty-five cents is the dues at each meeting. There are two meetings every i'.nth devoted to lectures, motor displays, technical and non-tcehnical discussions and addresses by men prominent in aviation.The prog-am for t'..c years activity includes the appearance of Air. Stout, president of the Metal Aircraft Corporation of Detroit. The opinions of such an important man will be significant in molding the course and policies of the A.-ia- f . Club. Also, the existence of local flying fields and air routes will be taken advantage of by visits and by referring, to them for information and statistics.
i u number of new members were welcomed to the club at the last meeting.The next meeting is Octobcr 16, ai.~ will be the farewell meeting to our representative to the conference at Yale.

Progress in Air Activities
Carnegie, for the first time, is to be represented by H. Wilkoff, president of the Aviation ^Club atibe annual Intercollegiate Aeronautical Conference which is to be held at Yale on Octobcr 19 and 20, and at which prominent aviators and authorities on air transportation will speak on various aspects of collegiate aviation. Harvard, Yale, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Michigan and New York University arc amone the schools to be represen tea.This meeting, significant for its proposal lo stimulate interest and activity in aviation among all important colleges and universities, will serve as a direct means of acquainting the institutions represented with the progress of collegiate aeronautics, It will afford Carnegie an opportunity to become acquainted with current activities in the rapidly growing aviation world.The Problem of Flight Instruction, Research and Equipment as Ground School Activities, and Intercollegiate Air Racing are important among the topics scheduled. The addresses will be supplemented by reports of the various representatives concerning aeronautics at their respective colleges. This general exchange of ideas is intended to establish a bond of relationship that will mutually benefit all institutions concerned.Intercollegiate air racing involves the addition of a new sport to the list of competitive college activities. An air race between Carnegie and Pitt has been suggested as a possible future event. Carnegie received a request to compete in the air races at the University of Southern California last year, but acceptance was impossible, because of, the lack of a plane. There is reason to believe, however, that if another request is received this year it will be accepted.Wilkoff will bring back with him complete reports from the conference, which will be used to assist the Aviation Club in its work and to inform Carnegie students of the progress of flying clubs in other schools.

These receptions, all of which arc informal, promise to provide interesting entertainment, as well as refreshments during the- course of the evening. All students,' especially freshmen and transferred students, are urged to attend these church receptions, as they offer an excellent opportunity to become acquainted with students not only from Carnegie but from the other Pittsburgh colleges as well. In past years these open nights held by 'the various churches of the city, have been remarkably successful and all who have attended them have made many new friends._ Churches which: will hold receptions on Octobcr 12 are: TheBaptist, First Baptist Church, corner Bayard and Bellefield Avenues; the Episcopal, Church of Ascension, corner Ellsworth and Neville Avenues; the Methodist Episcopal, Christ Methodist Episcopal Church, corner Center and Liberty Avenues; the Presbyterian, Bellefield Presbyterian Chur ch, corncr.

The conference idea will triumph over the time-clock as well as over the lock-step.It is particularly with reference to the curriculum, however, that the limited number of periods provided in the schedule has proved embarrassing. Because of it the college has thus far done little toward wrestling with the great problem of what to teach, -which Dr. Mciklejohn has so adventurously undertaken at Wisconsin. In this respect, as in -many others, Rollins stands so far in the same shoes as dozens of her compeers. The college has its unsolved questions of admission, of discipline, of student activities, of fraternities, of academic tenure, of collegiate self-government; . Many of these questions are now being studied at the initiative of a group . of the faculty of the collcge. Rollins boasts for president a man who,' while campaigning for endowment, indorses the doctrinc of evolution in Florida and public ownership in New York City. What college has better right to be proud of its liberalism? Who can doubt that it will be the questing spirit of Socrates, rather, than the dogmatism of M^rk Hopkins which will sit at the end of the Rollins log?The Nation.

That interest in tennis has by no means decreased at Carnegie is shown by the numbers in the fall tennis tournament. Twenty names we're signed to the list which hyrig last week on the gym bulletin 
board. Drawings have been made and a schedule of matches arranged. The first round must be finished by next Saturday, ..October 13. Any unplaycd matches, at that time, will be defaulted. The., eliminations should not take more than three weeks. Many of the matches promise a plcntitude of excitement especially as the tournament nears the finals. The entry list includes some freshmen, upper classmen and all returning members of last years 
varsity and plebe teams.To carry the tournament through on schedule time a few suggestions and rules Jiave been offered by those in charge:Ararnge for your match as soon as possible.The winner will place his name and score on the proper line oh the chart in the gym.Players will furnish their own1 tennis balls.Continue with the next round as scon as your opponent is that far.Finish the first round by Saturday, October 13.Watch the bulletin board in the gym for later information.Coach Hoover urges the utmost co-operation from all contestants. Such co-operation added to a little luck with the weather, in all probability, will mean a completed

First plans for what promises to 
be Carnegies most successful swim
ming season, were discussed last 
Monday afternoon. A meeting of 
varsity and Plebe candidates as 
well as would-be managers was 
lu-ld in the gym. After the busi
ness discussion was over the men took a short dip in the tank to give Coach Risedorph an impression of this seasons material. In accordance with a new plan of coaching, the men will not work in the pool again until November 5. 
In the meantime they will have workouts on the gym floor.
A most successful year is anticipated. Ten out .of last years eleven varsitly men arc eligible as well as several excellent performers from the 31 Plebe squad. Some of this seasons Plcbcs are brightening that teams chances also.Meets have been scheduled with Wooster, Case and Pitt, while tentative dates have been set with Notre Dame and W. & J. As usual,J ech and Pitt will meet twice during the winter. A Plebe schedule has not been arranged, -but local high schools will furnish most of the opposition.
Coach Risedorph desires every one possessing swimming ability to report for the squad. An invitation is extended to all freshmen tc try for the managership. The desired competition for this position has not yet been reached, <so the opportunity for success in this sport is greater, perhaps, than for 
any other. Those who didnt attend Mondays meeting should see either Coach Risedorph, Varsity Manager W. D. Bronson, Plebe Manager , Bob Woods or Henry Butts.
An ideal football day was in the j cards for the Frosh game against Kiski, but excepting that everything went against them, an altogether different team faced Kiski than that which battled St. Vincents -eleven to an 18-0 score Saturday a week ago, at Beatty.After repeated penalties for being off-sides and other penalties that no one knew the meaning of, the team began to act like a high- strung'race horse. Especially toward the end of the game dicl the line charge brokenly and the back- jield fumbled several, times due to the nervous strain. Kiski presented an offense and defense that no prep school or college freshman 
team should under rate, for if they do they will be handed a very ugly surprise package in none too gentle' methods by the eleven from Kiskiminetas Springs school. Dont get it wrong when the mention is made of the foregoing subject, for Kiski wasnt under rated. Owing to an unfortunate chain of circumstances the Plcbcs entered the fray a very different eleven thart the machine everyone expected. The Kiski team was every whit as heavy as the Plebes and showed evidence of having as. much experience. Taken by and large Jim Marks put a real grid aggregation on the field.
Kiski plunged the ball over the goal line in the first quarter on a succession of bheks and off-tacklc plays. Straight football characterized the offense of the Kiski gridders throughout the contest, as they very rarely used the overhead attack. Captain McMurdo made a 
successful kick fr ^lc extra point after touchdown.Starting the" second quarter McCurdy and Ziegler each made 20 yard runs in rapid fire order. On an exchange of kicks, one known as' a straight-up was snatched^ by Pounccy and carried to the Kiski ten yard line. At this point Carnegie made their greatest attempt to score but were thwarted" by two penalties totaling 25 yards. One of these was for an off-side play, but no one had the slightest idea what the other one was for. The1 half ended with the ball in Carnegies possession.In the first play of the second half McCurdy made a beautiful 40 yard run to Kiskis 30 yard line, but again a series of penalties knocked our touchdown hopes into a cocked hat. At this point Kiski started a march down the field [through repeated line bucks and ! Carnegie- penalties that found the ball on the Carnegie 21 yard line as the quarter ended. In the fourth quarter Kiski gained 11 yards on off-tackle bucks and then they were practically handed a touchdown through the medium of another penalty. McMurdo again kicked goal. In'the last few minutes of play Schmidt made another touchdown, but the try for point 
was unsuccessful Stauffer played a bang-up game at tackle, stopping nearly every play that came through his side of the line. . McCurdy, Pounccy, and Zeigler made the most of Carnegies gains.Carnegie was penalized 65 yards and Kiski 15. Kiski was not as superior as the score indicates, for Carnegie made seven first downs and Kiski eight, and four of these were results of Carnegie penalties.An early season defeat is not anything to wail about as it is sometimes the best tonic obtainable for the affliction known as overconfidence. Everyone - is looking forward to the West Virginia game Saturday with the expectations of the Plebes erasing all memories of this defeat from the minds of loyal sons of Skibo.Armentrout____L.E_____>,__ WattLletcher ----------L.T.(C)MMurdoPerch _________L.G_______ GailusDucanis ________C________ GrayKozicki _____,_R.G--------- WernerStauffer ______R.T____ MurdochMatia ________R.E________ MarkMcCurdy(C) ___Q.

There was a drop in immigration to the United STTltes for the year ended with last June by comparison with the inflow for 1927. Last years arrivals numbered  500,631 aliens, of whom 307,255 were immigrants and 193,376 non-immigrants. ^ For 1927 the figures were 335,175 immigrants and 202,826 nonimmigrants. Thus the chief dcclinc among arrivals last year was in the immigrant class, the only group that bears a relation to the permanent population of thecountry. The two -countries sending us the largest number of immigrants were Canada, with 73,154, an'd Mexico,, with 59,016. Neither of-*these countries falls within the quota restrictions. Germany, which does, sent us 45,778 immigrants, while there were 38,193 of Irish stock, 33,597 of English, 23,177 of Scotch, 18,740 of Italian, 18,644 of Scandinavian, and 17,963 of -'French. Thus t/.e aim of the framers of our present immigration policya stock ' primarily _ from the North European j racesis in process of realization, although there arc political and economic causes to account for it as well as our statutes. Mussolini, for instance, is discouraging Italian emigration and we have the spectaclecurious when one recalls past figuresof nearly as 'many immigrants from France as from Italy.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN TUESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1928.

---------------------------------------------------

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1928.THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
CARNEGIE TECHS BACKFIELD SQUADed, while on the defense they were hopelessly outclassed. Great holes were ripped in the line, and before the backs could rush up to make the tackle our own back- field was through the line and away. The Ashland coaches played a seven man line against the Tartans in order to stop the line bucks, but thijh would not have been successful wad they played a ten man line. The Tech fofwards resembled a seven dog team tugging at the,harness. The snapping of the ball was the signal for them to go, and away, they went, rooting out everything in front of them. To pick out any individual star on the line would be unfair to the rest, for they were oft together before the line opposite them was even set for the onslaught. If the team improves every week as they did last week Tech . should have a great year.
football players are born, hot, Certainly, he points out,! pi attributes enter into being feet football player, but a factured tackle or fullback \\ ways remain an automaton, chanical player. The boy \ worth his weight in gold Is h is always in every play and game up to his neck.
A Football Players 
Opinion of the 
Ashland Game
Saturday, October 6, -Carnegie showed their true strength by defeating Ashland 65-0 in a onesided game. The visitors put up a good game but the Skibos were out to show the public that they have something. Dyke .Beede docs not know how fortunate he was last Saturday, for if Wallys athletes had played against the Titans as they played last Saturday it is doubtful if Westminster would have been able to put 11 men on the field for their last game. The game was not very interesting from a spectators point of view, but it threw a scare into the men who were scouting the Tartans. The smiles that the scouts wore after watching . the sloppy exhibition at Youngstown were changed to more serious expressions.From a *technical standpoint Tech played almost flawless football, and if the grins on Steffen and Waddell meant anything-'they were well satisfied with the game. Captain Iiarpster who led the attack for the Skibos, played a great game at quarter. His generalship and passing were excellent and the few punts that lie made in the last few minutes of play were of the long high,, spiral variety which .give the backs who catch them plenty of trouble. The real bright' spot 
in the Tech offense was the plunging of Karcis. Time after time he hit the opposing line, ripping it to shreds and generally running through most of> the secondary. His play is very consistent, and Pitt, W. and J. and the others will find that he is a hard nut to crack. Moorhead, Letzeltcr, and especially Eythe, could all be mentioned as great ball carriers, but to point out any one individual star would be difficult.
The line appeared to have found itself and showed its great strength throughout the whole encounter. Ashland was outcharged from start to finish. When the Ohioans had the ball their' backs were ;stopped many times before they got start< "Sports writers, next to j sional athletes, have* the mo lightful life on earth, says brook Peglcr in the Novcml sue of College Humor, writi Experts. They are paid hoorayed for doing in office what they would do anywa relaxation and pleasure if the to work. They attend ball ( prize fights, tennis, golf, and tournaments, horse races, l- matches, and the like. They all over -the country and a i them winter in the tropics, sure I would like this."It was my notion that writing was one specialized o tion in which the practitioner get by knowing no more 
his subject than a fry cool modern drug store knows ab( U. S. pharmacopoeia. Jiowt believe a reporter should b to write an account of anyth sees and that if lie hasnt ac latcd enough lay knowledge game we play in this courr afford him a general underst! of what is going on, he isn servant enough tb be a repoi the first place.
THOMAS LIPPERT
THEY CAME, they couldnt help to seebut unlike the 
noble Caesar, they got knocked off. Ashland may have been a 
big shot in their Ohio Home, but we are afraid the game de
generated into a scrimmage practice for the Skibos.
BUT, A 65-0 DEFEAT is a hard enough pill to swallow 
without rubbing it in. The Ohioans were gamefighting against 
hopeless odds and admitted defeat, they managed to keep the 
contest interesting. However, they were not in Carnegies class 
that is about all that can be said about the game.HOW BILL ROPER PICKS 
HIS PRINCETON 
VARSITYBUT! THESE BUCKEYES seem to be rather hard nuts 
to crack. Unlike the Westminster workout only several of the 
Ashlanders were hurt and those only slightly. In comparison, 
Schnupp, formidable guard, left the game with several torn 
shoulder ligaments. "Bert says he will be on deck for the 
W. and J. scrap. Again Dutch Eytli, flashing half, received 
a wrenched leg early in the -contest while Eovewdl was simi
larly, but not so badly, hurt, in the closing period.
A FEW BOUQUETS could be distributed. Despite lack 
of competition it was easily seen that the squad had overcome 
many of the errors so prevalent in their initial game. Harpster 
and Karcis were the most consistent outstanding performers of 
the afternoon. Eyth, Moorehead, Rosenz.weig and Dreshar, all 
played games above criticism.
HOWEVER it is such walkovers that do more harm to a 
team than good. , No player is pressed, which has a ten
dency to produce laxness and inefficiency besides that jinx of 
many elevensOVERCONFIDENCE.* * * *** *

WALLY AND WADDELL have the traditional habit of
taking a drink (aqua) for every touchdown made. Saturday two 
managers were kept busy supplying the necessary water and 
the final quarter found both coaches showing unmistakable signs 
of being waterlogged.
THE JUDGE doesnt care to have his boys run up more 
than a 40-0 score on any team, for many different reasonsbut 
what can you do if all your substitutes insist on forcing over 
touchdowns?
"The quality I look for at first is best described as tile ability to handle oneself, says Bill Roper, Princeton coach, in the November jssuc of College Humor; "a close correlation between mind and muscle which shows in balance, speed, rhythm and grace, I seek out the men with nerve and cheerfulness, who do not complain too readily of bumps and discouragements and bruises. The successful coach studies his squad and learns the dispo
sitions and temperaments of every player. The unimaginative boy perfectly set up but utterly lacking in fire and spirit to rise to a fighting . pitch during a game is a thorn in any coach's basket of roses."There is a general impression that only big, brawny men have a chance to excel in football. .Coach Yost, of Michigan, gives five qualities that make up the football player: determination, perseverance, co-ordination, brains and strength. Determination, not strength, is the first thing I look for, he says. The strong, brainy, co-ordinated boy is not an athlete unless he possesses the determination and willingness to persevere."Stagg, of Chicago, believes that

A university mans garb, always the object of much scrutiny by clothiers, is again in the limelight. These go-getters have completed another of their '"surveys, this time time in three widely separated educational institutions.In the South, Vanderbilt was selected as a typical university in a university town. In the North, Yale was chosen for the same reason.. And for middle ground, Princeton was selected. The results were combined and the following statement (which they would have you believe) made:"In all of these colleges, observers found that almost unanimously, the students had reverted from the slouchy college tendency of recent years, to a tidiness and care in dress that was surprising.In all the colleges the starched collar was found to be so nearly universal that it appears to constitute almost a uniform. The comfortable low, pliant, starched varieties were most in demand in both North and Sputh."Extreme cuts of trousers, absurd shirt collar and lie combination and other freakish effects have disappeared.
"The college man, according to one student, realizes that lie is a potential wage earner and that lie is judged by his habits in clothes as well as in his other practices. He is not attractive to his col-' leagues, to the co-eds or to his future employer in silly-looking clothes. . ."That is why het has decided to wear reasonable looking clothes.

WISCONSIN had a lot of nerve beating Notre Dame 22-6 
before we get a crack at the Irish.. However their twenty-twoyear record of no home defeat is still intactthat is, intact until 
November 17.
GEORGETOWN IS ENCOUNTERED November 10 at 
Albany, N. Y. Why at Albany, we dont know. The following 
is an extract from The Hoya, Georgetown Universitys paper: 
'Carnegie Tech, at Albany, N. Y., is the order for the 10th of 
November. Eawrence Perry, J;he leading football authority of 
the press, gives in a recent interview that Carnegie will have 
the leading team in the country this .season, Knute Rockne is of 
a similar opinion, just the least bit altered. He picks them to 
be the second team in the national rating. Asked who he 
thought would give him the most opposition this season, Rockne 
did not hesitate to mention Carnegie first.* * * * * * *
AN 18-0 VICTORY at St. Vincents opened the .Plebes 
season. Journeying to Kiski they fell before the prep school 
boys with a 20-0 score, in their second game. With a tearft 
considerably heavier than the freshmen, Kiski is always a formideable opponent and the Prebes can not be criticized for their 
defeat. The Kiski aggregation was one of the toughest teams 
encountered by last years Plebes.
POOR AND ONE-SIDED refereeing is the cry we hear 
from many sources as partial cause for the defeat. That is one 
of the oldest and poorest alibis' to advance, but according to 
unbiased spectators the decisions were absolutely rank. Its 
hard enough to play eleven men without the officials jumping in.
THE FIRST YEAR MEN played a commendable game. 
Stauffer, 210 pound tackle, was the most brilliant performer; 
few plays passed through his side. McCurdy, at quarter, and 
Ziegler, at half, continued their excellent playing., * * * * * * *
THE PITTSBURGH REPRESENTATIVES of Iiearst and 
Scripps-Howard must have something against "Dear Old Tech.
Somehow we get very tired of seeing Carnegie always mentioned
after Pitt,,both in headings and stories. If they can not loosen 
up with a separate head, we would greatly appreciate a fiftyfifty break when it comes to first mention.' But then, Carnegie, 
secluded in the wilds of Schenley, is perhaps not considered 
worthy of tile city of Pittsburgh.* =i' * *  * * *
THE THIEL GAME should be one worth seeing. They 
are somewhat lighter than Carnegie, but still above the average. 
Pitt chalked up a 20-0 victory over the Lutheransour score 
should be about 30-0, but a little doubtful with Schnupp on the 
bench. (Continued on page eight) *

Todajr it is one, of the simplest and most effective in football. Pop has a flock of basic plays which he gives his team the first week every season. During a season he will give approximately sixty plays; about twenty of them will be used. A rival coach once said that if Stanford had a quarter ready to call the plays Pop gives Stanford teams, 110 one in the country could hold Stanford under six touchdowns.The players never get familiar with Pop, never feel close to him .personally, although they do wise- creck him occasionally and he likes- it. lie is one of the crowd when he is .with other people, ?nd his favorite indoor sport is to gather several old-timers around him and have a 'remember when game.

Our own James Russell Lowell wrote the above in his bitter opposition to the Mexican war as a slave-holders enterprise. But then Lowell was merely ridiculing one of the worlds most popular and admired institutions; here is Thomas Carlyle also putting Mars in a very bad light when he says------What, speaking in quite unofficial language, is the net purpose and upshot of war? To my own knowledge, for example, there dwell and toil, in the British village of Dumdrudge, usually some five hundred souls. From these, by certain Natural Enemies of the French, there are successfully selected, during the French war, say 30 able-bodied men. Dumdrudge, at her vown expense, has suckled and nursed them; she has, not without difficulty and sorrow, 
fed them up to manhood, and even trained them to crafts, so that one can weave, another build, another hammer, and the weakest can stand under 30 stone avoirdupois. Nevertheless, amid much weeping and swearing, they are selected; all dressed in i<ed, and shipped away, at' the public charges, some two two thousand miles, or' say only to the south of Spain, and fed there till wanted. And now to that same spot, * in the south of Spain, arc 30 similar French artisans, from a French Dumdrudge, in like manner wending, till at length, after infinite effort, the two parties come into actual juxtaposition-, and Thirty stands fronting Thirty, each with a gun in his hand. Straightway Lhe word Fire !" is given and they blow the souls out of -one another, and in place of 60 brisk useful craftsmen, the world has 60 dead carcasses, which it must bUry, and anew shed tears for.

In that fiction of the English Smollett, it is true, the final Cessation of War is perhaps prophetically shadowed forth; where the two Natural ' Enemies, in person, take each a Tobacco pipe, filled with Brimstone; light the same, and smoke in one anothers faces, till the weaker gives in; but from such firedicated Peace-Era, what blood-filled trenches, and contentious centuries, may still divide us?".Now we hear from Count Leo Tolstoy, the great Russian novel
ist. Since he was Russian, we had better not quote his literature but nevertheless we will take a chance.The bells will peal, long-haired men will dress in golden sacks to pray for successful slaughter. And the old story will l/egin again, the awful customary acts.The editors of the daily1 Press will frfcgin virulently' to stir men up to hatred and manslaughter in the name of patriotism, happy in the receipt of an increased income. Manufacturers, merchants, contractors for military stores, will hurry joyously about their business, in th- hope of double receipts.All sorts of Government officials will buzz about, foreseeing a possibility of purloining something more than usual. The military authorities will hurry hither and thither, drawing double pay and rations, and with  tlie expectation of receiving for the slaughter of other men, various silly little ornaments which they so highly prjze, as ribbons, crosses,, orders and stars. Idle ladies and gcntlenten will make a great .fuss, entering their names in advance for the Red - CrosS Society, and ready to bind up the wounds of those whom their liusSands and brothers will mutilate; and they will imagine that in so doing they are performing a most Christian work.And, ' smothering despair within their souls by s.ongs, licentiousness and wine, 'men will trail along, torn from peaceful labor, from their wives, mothers and children men with murderous weapons in their handsanj'where they may be driven."They will march, freeze, hunger, suffer sickness, and die from it, or finally come to some place where they will be slain by thousands or kill thousands themselves with no reasonmen whom they have never seen before; and who neither have done nor could do them any ^mischief.
And when the number of sick, wounded and killed becomes so great that there are i not -hands enough left to pick them up, and when the air is so , infected with the putrefying scent of the food for powder that even the authorities 
find it disagreeable, a truce will be . made, the wounded will be picked up anyhow, the sick will be brought in  and huddled together in heaps, the killed will be covered with earth and lime,- and once more all the crowd of deluded men will be led on_ and on till those who have devised the project, weary of it, or till those who thought to find it profitable receive their spoil.And so once more men will be made savage,. fierce and brutal, and love will wane in the world, and the Christianizing of mankind, which has already begun, will lapse for scores and hundreds of years. And so, once more the men who 
reaped profit from it all, will assert with assurance that since there has been a war there must' needs have been one, and that other Avars must follow, and they will again prepare future generations for a continuance of  slaughter,. depraving them from their birth.
Arsene Lupin
Synopsis of last weeks installment By wireless, the passengers on board the transatlantic liner, the Provence, learn that the famous thief, Arscne Lupin, is on board. Shortly afterwards Lady Jerland discovers that many of her precious jewels have been stolen. A certain Rozainc is suspected \ of being Lupin in disguise.
From the star set with diamonds, from the piindant of uncut rubies, from the broken collars and bracelets, some one had torn out, strangely enough, not the largest stones, but the finest and most precious ones, those, one might have said, which represented the 1 most value for their size. The mountings lay there on the table. I saw' them, every one saw them, despoiled of their jems . like flowers from which some one has pulled off the shining 
and colored petals.And to get away with the theft it had been necessarv. during ,the 
hour when Lady Jerland was taking her tea, in open  day, 'and in a corridor where people were liable to pass to and fro, to break open the door of the cabin, to find a lit- 'tle  bag purposely hidden, at the bottom of a hat box, .to N open it, and to choose 1There was only one comment to make. There was only one opinion among all the passengers when the theft became known: ItsArsene Lupin. And in fact, it was just his complicated, mysterious, inconceivable way, but a logical way in spite of that, because if it would have been difficut to conceal the bothersome: bulk all the jewels put together would have formed, how much less would be his embarrassmentN with tlio^e detached little jewels-lie had taken, pearls, emeralds and sapphires.At dinner, this happened: atRozaiiies left' and right the two chairs were empty. That evening we learned that he had been sent for by the captain.His arrest, which no one doubted would fake place, made every one feel easier. At length one could breath freely. That same evening we played various little games. Some danced. Miss ' Nelly, especially,  displayed an astonishing gaiety, which made me feel that if the attentions of Rozainc had 
pleased her at first, she no longer remembered them. The grace she displayed put an end to her 'conquest of me. Toward midnight, in the serene clearness of the room, I admitted to her my love, with an emotion which did not seem to displease her.The next day, to the general stupor of all, we learned that the charges against him not being sufficient, Rozainc was free.The son of a fairly important business man of Bordeaux, he had shown papers perfectly in order.
Besides, his arms didnt show the least trace of a wound.Papersl birth certificatesi cried the,, enemies of Rozainc, "but Arsene' Lupin \yill furnish you with as many of those, as you want. As to the wound, lie never received' one, or lies removed its tracci 1Some one objected that at the hour of the theftand this, was provedRozaiin: was walking about on the deck. But they replied to this:
Does a man like Arscne Lupin need to be present at a theft which he commits?"
Moreover, in addition to every thing else there was one point which the most skeptical could not get around. Who, except Rozainc, was traveling alone, was blond, and had a name commencing with R? Who could the wireless indicate, if it wasnt Rozaine?
And \ylien Rozaine,a few min- utes before lunch, audaciously came toward our group, Miss Nelly and Lady Jerland got up and moved away. They were obviously afraid.
An hour later, a manuscript statement was going from hand to hand among the ships employes, the sailors, and the travelers of every class; M. Louis Rozaine promised a sum of 10,000 franco to whoever discovered Arsene Lupin, or found the possesser of the stolen stones.
And ,if no one will come to my aid against the' bandit,t. Rozaine declared, to the captain> ,T will' take this affair upon myself.
Rozaine against Arsene Lupin, or rather, according to the word which was going . about, Arsene Lupin himself against, Arsene Lupinthe 
light wouldnt lack interest. Things went on that way for two days.We saw Rozaine wander about from right to left, mix with the personnel of the ship, ask. quesr 
tions, poke abut in corners. One could seje his shadow', at night, stalking his prey.
For his part, the. captain displayed the most active energy. Front top to, boUom, in every 
corner, the Provence was searched. Men searched all the cabins, without exception, with the excellent pretext that the jewels were hidden anywhere except in the cabin of the guilty one.The;- will certainly end by discovering something, wont they? Miss Nelly demanded of me. Skill'll! as he is, lie cant make those diamonds  and pearls become invisible.
.But perhaps he-can, I replied, unless the linings of our hats arc searched, and the lining of our vests, and everything that wc wear.
And showing her my kodak, a nine by twelve with which I hadnt tired taking pictures of her in
Dear Mr. Ralston:I have heard a rumor that Cardo is not going to write Thistledow^ this year because he thinks he is too busy. I think that ii you could publish half a dozen letters from your readers asking him to write again,- and telling him how eagerly, they are waiting to read his articles, he. micht be persuaded to write everj' other week perhaps, or oncc in three weeks, or even oncc a month.

every possible attitude, L remarked:Nothing more is necessary than a camera no bigger than this one. Dont you tjiink there would-be room inside it for all the preciousstones of Lady Jerland? Onewould only have to pretend totake pictures, and the game would be played. / 1
But I've heard it said that there is no thief who doesnt leave belling him some clue.The,res one: Arsene Lupiii. Why?. v'Wliy? Because that man thinks not onl}' of the theft he commits, but also of every possible circumstance which might give him 
away.At the beginning you- were more confident of1 finding ^him.  "But since- then I have seen him at work.;Weill then, according to you? According to me, were losing our time. vIn fact, the investigations, were leading nowhere, or at least, what was'discovered was -of slight value in comparison with the effort spent in discovering it. And then, the captainls watch was  stolen . from ,ltim.Furjous, he redoubled his. exertions and  again scrutinized . Rozaihe closely, with whom he had already had several interviews. The next dayit was charming!)! ironicsomeone 'found the watch among the dirty collars of a'~sub- ordinale officer.
All this was rather unusual, and evinccd well enough the humorous ways of Arsene Lupin, .thief, yes, but dilettante as well. He s'toje because he liked to steal, and because that was the way he earned his living, certainly, but for amus.e^ 
ment also. lie gave one the. impression of a man who amused himself at the comedy he made other people take part in, and who laughed loudly behind the scenes at his own wit and the situations lie imagined.Certainly, he was an artist in his own line, and when I noticed Rozainc, gloomy and obstinate, and 
thought of the double role which that curious person was. without doubt playing, I could not speak of him without a certain friendship. ,.'ow, the night before we were to land, the officer of the forth watch heard some groans coming from the darkest part of the deck. He approachcd them. A man. was strctched out there, his head wrapped in a very thick grey shawl, his wrists tied together by a small strong cord.His bonds were removed. Hfc was taken, up and given first aid. The man was Rpzaine.It was Rozaine, attacked during one of his expeditions) brought to earth and stripped. A visiting card fastened by a pin to his clothing bore these words: Arscne Lupin acccpts with thanks the. 10,000 francs of M. Rozaine;
As a 'matter of fact, the l half empty bill fold had contained 20,- 000 franc notes. Ten of them were still in it.
Naturally, the unhappy man was accused of having made a- pretense of this attack against himself. But. outsidfc of the fact that it wpuld have been impossible for him to tie himself up as he -had been, it was proved that the writing on the card was absolutely different^' from the writing of i'.ozaine, and resembled on the contrary Arsene Lupins, as an old paper found on board reproduced it.Rozaine, then,; was- no- .longer Ars.ene-.;:Lupm.v Rozaine was Rozaine, the son of a Bordeaux business man. And Arsene Lupin had given- evidence/,sch his presence once more, and by what an extraordinary act!
Then was the moment when everyone- was terrified. No one dared to remain alone in his cabin, 
and still less to wander about alone in unfrequented spots, Prudently,we formed little groups with-people we felt sure of. Still, an instinctive distrust separated the most- intimate. . The menace.seemed not to come from one person, and consequently .to be relatively siight. ArseneLupin had become anyone . . . everyone. Our overexcited imagination clothed him with; a. miraculous and unlimited  pow^r. We thought of him as capable of- taking the most unexpected disguises, of being-turn by turn the respectable Major Rawson or the noble Marquis de. Ravedan, or even, for we-no longer bothered .with the accusing initial R. even such or such person known, to all as hav* intr a wife, children and servants.The first wireless dispatches from the States brought no news. At least the captain gave us none, and sm-li a silence didnt reassure us.The last day seemed interm'iiv able. We lived in ah anxious ex- pectation^ of misfortune. This, time, we felt, it would not- be a theft, or a simple assault, it would be. a crime, perhaps murder;' We 'could
ut bring, ourselves to believe that

EDUCATOR DISCUSSES
THE SMALL COI LEGES
There have been so many different rumors about Thistledown these last two weeks that he has decided it . necessary to make a frank statement that he has no intention of writing a column this year for the Tartan. Seriously speaking, aside Jrom amusing a few Tartan readers last year, Thistledown believes he accomplished . one important thing. T histle- down made so much noise about plebe regulations that he is con-, vinced more credit is due him than anyone else -for stirring, up student opinion to the point of the Student Council^vote which abolishes regulations this year at Christmas, or is it midyears? For that benefit, Thistledown hopes that all . future Carnegie plebes will render him praises in their prayers. Thistledown has a notion that the other things he occasionally discussed are pretty hopeless causes. From the few times he has been in the Grill tliis fall, it seems to him to be worse than ever. The scrvicc is slower, the tables are greasier, the clear-away help is never there- to clear away dirty dishes, there is almost no choice of meats. The' library seems to remain a sort of social center for dating, where there is more feminine chatter than Silcnce. Plebe trials and frat hell' weeks, will probably be as stupid, vulgar and uncivilized this year as last. ' College elections will probably be- just as farcical and corrupt as real politics. 'Thistledown is too busy to spend the year un fruitfully, yapping about such things.- He feels that he. has almost outlived his usefulness, so lie prefers - to withdraw with a little glory, while .he can? He bequeaths his buffoonery to Nathan Miller, who i still practices his inimitable sty^e. He bequeaths his uplifting enthusiasms to the Editor to dump into the. editorial col umns. Thistledown never knev very accurately how many people were reading him last year, or how. they liked him, although' he listened to several very amusing discussions , about himself, and even took part in a few. Thistledown hopes the' Tartan will be able , to provide its readers \vith something almost as good as himself, for this is  the last time lie will appear before his public, the last time lie will make them a. grimace with his p[aid pen; this is good old Thistledowns farewell to dear old Tech. Think it over! Finally, 'who Cardo Chardon Discnwolle was-; and why he. wrote Thistledown last year, let anyone find out who can.Yours for prickles, Cardo,

The great universities with present day enrollments of 5,000 to -25,000 are like factories, turning out graduates supplied with 'specified facts on certain subjects, but they lack the advantages of intimate 
contacts between teacher and students and the congenial community Me Which develops character and fosters culture, he declares.
There is also a social thrcatwlficli is more  dangerous-iii huge crowds than in small compnies," lie says. It is the danger of 
bolshevism- and atheism, > It is an easy matter in' these crowded educational centers -to couple up disbelief. in God with disbelief in government.
One dollar expended, at Hanover, a small college in Indiana, gives as much culture as five at Harvard. As a graduate of both institutions I can truly make .this statement.
Students Lose Individuality The real specific benefit of the .^mall college lies in the fact that it:- students are individuals. They know their professors. They are not simply numbers in a huge herd, without recognition or individuality.
In a comhiencement in which from one. to two thousand graduates receive -their diplomas, as is the case in . many of our large universities', there- is no individuality. There may be a fe\y who have graduated with honors, but most of them rise and, without even an-: s we ring to their names,- are -given' the degree of Bachelor-of Arts, or whatever other degree they may receive. , ' -  '
The whole benefit of personal contact with the professor, the. advantage of his personal and sympathetic attention and his interest in each individual character as it is unfolded before .him during the years * of the association, are all lacking in this mass instruction.The safety of the future, the purity of learning, and the effi
ciency of teaching arc all inti- .irjat-ely .bound up with the' small educational unit.

Yales honor system has been abandoned in part m the request of the -student council This rtil6 applies to the tliret ipper classes 
only. Freshmen and students in the Sheffield school proceed on the basis so successful at Washington and Lee. (The demand for faculty super
vision grew out of the feeling that the -pledge was no longer effective; that too .much cribbing by some and the refusal of those on the 
level to report violations,, was unfair.
Just why.the honor system could not work at'Yale is by no means, clear. Perhaps the experiment was not given a sufficiently long trial. Success comes with tradition. The many famous alumni of tlie Hartford school will look on the rer version with regret.It is almost linbelie-vable that an institution with so high a rating 
as Yale w'ould allow itself to give up an honor system. To Washington and Lee students the honor system is the backbone of the institution. On our campus it has 
been in vogue for generations. It lias worked, is working, and will work as long as this institution bears the name of two men. who held honor greater than life.
Other Southern institutions have working honor systems. V. M. I., our friendly neighbor, and, the University of Virginia, just over the Blue Ridge, also have codes known tin* world over. With honor work-' ing, as it does, in these three schools, must Yale,-with the same 
Cciliber of students, ssercise faculty supervision of qualities which make a. gentleman?
Where the system has been, working over a number of years, among students, with an average sense of responsibility, it is working effectively, not merely to keep examinations free from dishonesty, 
but to instill into the whole campus life,au honorable 'quality which is- .incalculably valuable. In such institutions they let it be known 
that gentlemen do not need watching, and only gentlemen are al
lowed.Could the size of an institution have anything to do with the function of an honor system?sWherc . attendance has grown rapidly too little time is permitted 
for the full saturation of students with traditions. In a student being deprived of an honor system, he.is .being deprived of the greatest training of self-control. However, if cribbers arc allowed to have their own wa}', a grave injustice 
is being done to the decent men and the standards' of the institution are being debased.Washington and Lee is proud .of its 'head or system. The students 
realize that to crib- they- would only be victimizing themselves. They visualize the wonderful-bene
fits derived from its great code.
Who is responsible for the quip 
that the only thing wrong about 
the younger generation is their 
parents, I do not remember,- but 
certainly that seems to be . the opin
ion of Sir Philip Gibbs. The Age of Reason is the best novel treating of this hackneyed theme that wc have read. The title is. derived from the opinion of Hes- peth Jerningham, a brilliant professor of scicncc, .that we are fast approaching an era of popular enlightenment; with the decline of the church and the abandonment of out-worn traditions, the desires of mankind will be gratified by the fruits of honest science and cold reason.Jerningham is a widower. In keeping with his plain, scientific habits; he proposes marriage to ^largaret Allgate, one of his students, when the two are left alone in his laboratory. Margaret is as lovely of face as she is lovable in- character but of modest attainments. Although taken completely unawares, she^accepts her teacher. The marriage^follows shortly after but not without heart-burning and 
doubt on her parti While on her honeymoon in Italy she meets her husbands two children. ,B4i are precocious and charming, but Cyril is sensitive, and serious while Viola is full of wit and animal spirits.They return to England, but Margaret finds it difficult ,to adjust herself to the cold impersonal atmosphere of Jerninghams house and her bluntly-frank stepchildren, almost as old as herself. Viola, who has absorbed the scientific jargon of her father, glories in her paganism, and when . she meets Guy, Margarats brother, he is overwhelmed by the freshness and vigor of lstr personality. A sort of attachment grows up between them.Margaret is unhappy in her new home and when she gives birth to a still-born child, she is convinced that her marriage, was a mistake. To add to her mortification, Viola announces that she and Guy propose to take a pre-nuptial and unchaperoned; walking trip through France, Hespeth, true to his teachings, does not object, but Margaret, hurt to the quick, rebels strenuously. Against Viola she. makes no headway, but she almost has her brother convinced of the folly .of the undertaking when the aggressiveness' of Viola wins him ovei1 and lie reluctantly follows her after a dramatic scene. The .honeymoon proves disastrous. Guys false pride and conventional stan-f dards do not satisfy his freedom- loving companion and when Viola meets one of Margarets- former admirers, who . happens, to be abroad on a diplomatic mission, the two become close friends arid she dismisses GUy. He returns a complete wreck.To add to the sorrows of the miserable. Margaret,- her stepson upraids her for. having married his father and confesses that lie is desperately and passionately in love with, her. A poignant episode follows in .which,'he, his father and stepmother take, part. He leaves his home but returns just in time to hear that the heart-broken Gtiy has taken his life.The Age of Reason begins in a leisurely manner, but acquires momentum and ends in drama. Sir Philip has obviously written a thesis, Science versus Faith, and it is manifest which side Jic favors,
but the case for the opposition is stated with utmost fairness and will be read with interest irrespective of the readers personal bias. The novel should make good stage material and Messrs. Metro-Gold- wyn-Mayer will no doubt wish it for their cinema cathedrals.
The former dramatic critic of the New York Times has written a novel of Broadway, Greenwich 
Village and the academic life. Being hjmself a .playwright as well as critic, we are presented with a first-hand picture of stage life.
The story is related in the person of Htnry Boardmanevidently the authors self-portraitwho is , attached to the faculty of Columbia University. Boardman is a young man who views life quite detached from the petty outlook of his fellows but is outwardly a good mixer. _ His pen portraits of the Greenwich Village rabble arc excellent and his observations on university life are quite cyni.cal.Eleanor Dandridge,- who. conies from a small university town in the south, where she had known Boardman from childhood, attains immediate success as an actress. After a year on Broadway she re
turns to her home. Her metamorphosis from a simple and charming soul to a saddened and suffering one follows a series of unhappy experiences; the death of her father, the suicide of- a sensitive young student who finds her. in the arms oi her lover, and her deception by the latter. She returns to her work on the stage in a shallow, conventional play, ready to lend her soul and beauty to those whose lives arc sordid (and empty.j Youngs opus leans more to the lyric than to the dramatic in its treatment. The following passage 
is typical of many throughout the novel:
Lena stood there. She listened to the silence under the slope. . . . The world seemed stillness and yet all rhythm, rapture 'of flight and quietness; And suddenly in 
the open, under the boughs of a beech tree farther on, we saw the evening star, steadfast and throbbing, ^it seemed to shine over the world, but most on your own breast.Lena felt the hour entering into her, and stood there with the knowledge that, some day afterward, at some .moment on tlie stage, she would feel all her body become this moment ...She could see herself at some moment in a play, her body lifted with these trees, her mind filled with his quiet and passion; and in the midst of that would - conic the .living idea arising like the star out beyond the edge of the lane thcf.c. And she could hear tinwords rise. to their cicrnal placr could hear herself speak then and, in the pause that followe before the applause began, a lnif in her own soul, a waiting for t wood and the dusk there the moon.

Berkeley, Calif.The fact that  pre-Christian Babylonia exisTed u/i-' dcr a feudal system similar to that, of Europa and particularly. of Eng-j land ' as late as the seventeenth; century has been established by an'accidental disovery of-a hitherto- unstudied clay tablet in the University of California Museum of Anthropology-.Feudal lords held sway over vast domains of land under such famous kings as Artaxerxes I, Daniils' I (the. Persian) . and Artaxerxes 11, paying taxes of flour, beer, dates, t m.cat or other monetary equivalent | and collecting ; taxes in turn from ; their knights and other landlords.The feudal system was, in some I respects, higher in type than that | of England several centuries lat- cr, for the roads were in good j enough condition, to make the col-i lection of taxes possible, thus obviating the necessity of farming out! taxes as' did early English kings: with their traveling courts.Basis for this picture of Babylonia in the fifth century B.C. is  contained in one inscribed clay tab-1 let which has been translated by Dr. Ii. F. Lutz, associate professor 
of - Egyptology and - Assyriology, after .having been 'overlooked for: about 20 years, since it^ presenta-1 tion by Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst, friend of the university.The tablet in question a contrast between a Babylonia= knight and his feudal lord, one of the. grandsons of the house ot Maru- shu, providing for the lease of a | tract of land in return for .military I service and taxes. IProfessor Lutz explains that the archives of the house of - Marushu are. well- known by scholars and I that some. 730 inscribed clay tab-J lets now in museums of Constanti-j nople and America liave been found' during the past'i 30 years in the
ruins of the Babylonian city of 
Nippur. But always the spirit ot these, tablets has been misinterpreted, he states, scholars inclining to the belief that they represent the transactions of an ancient banking housea forgotcn House of Morgan or-Rothschild.
The new tablet, however, with its unmistakable proof of a feudal system, has thrown a new light on all . those old documents and Professor Lutz says that reinterpVet- ed with this romantic system in mind their meaning becomes more clear.
The tablet itself is about .four, by five inches in area, and an inch thick,- closely inscribed with cuneiform letters on both sides and all the edges. By its testimony a certain Semite gentleman pledged his hand and sword to defend his lord and the king in exchange for ? fief of land that had been tillcc by his grandfather before him. In witness thereof, he impressed the seal of his ring beside that of tlie lord, in the presence of three witnesses who also stamped their ring signatures on the tablet.
After _ baking, that tablet was placed in the family archives at Nippur, and 3,000 years later it was uncovered by some specimen hunter and later purchased by Mrs. Hearst. Whether the Semite gentleman died for his king, or lived to govern his fief for many years, the records do not show.
Professor Lutz points out that this chance discovery, is but  one example of the many startling facts 
still . to be learned about- ancient Babylonia. He: hopes to .make more discoveries next year . during a contemplated, trip to Bagdag, as exchange professor to the American' University of Archeology.
