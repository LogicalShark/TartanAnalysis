DORKIIORIES TO BE 
BUILT AT LAST!
Will Be Completed Next Fall.
To him who knows how to wait--------
At last it has come ! For those of us, 
who tempermentally impulsive, do not 
know how to wait, probably because we 
realize so little the difficulties inherent 
to the doing of large things, the dormi
tory question seemed destined never to 
become a reality. No one realizes 
the painstaking efforts, the unbelievable 
patience, the delicacy of skill which 
have been necessary to make the dorm
itories at the Carnegie institute of 
Technology an actual fact.
When the history of the work done 
by Director Hamerschlag in building 
up the Schools is finally written, the 
dormitory question will assume its right 
magnitude and will occupy a preponder
ant part in the list of his achievements.
In keeping with the character of the 
School, the dormitories will be sub
stantial, comfortable, hygienic and de
mocratic. There will be no rich man 
or poor man unit; it will be an estab
lishment in which the best spirit of 
Tech will be given and opportunity to 
reach its fullest expression, along the 
lines for which it has so far been 
known, namely clean living, hard work 
and unrivaled good fellowship.
For the present the buildings will con
sist of two units, each accommodating 
about one hundred students in single 
and double rooms, steam heated, elec
trically lighted, with proper regard for 
area and ventilation and adequate toilet 
and bathing facilities. The furniture 
will be both decorative and substantial, 
and will meet the requirements expected 
of dormitory furniture.
When one realizes that the erection 
of the dormitories is absolutely a busi
ness venture and that in spite of the 
cost of land and building material in 
this district, the student will get larger 
rooms, better accommodations in a mod
ern new building on Woodlawn Ave
nue within three hundred yards of the 
Campus, at a price not greater than the 
one he now pays, the merits of the prop
osition are obvious.
The single rooms, furnished, will rent 
for about $100 per school year, the dou
ble rooms (corner) $150.00all other 
double rooms for $140.00. The prices 
include heat, light, service and bedding 
except blankets.
Although a faculty proctor will re
side in each unit, the student, in keep
ing with the democratic idea, will gov
ern himself, the school authorities trust
ing that his sense of proportion will 
ever enable him to differentiate between 
freedom and license.
It is expected that at the beginning
BASEBALL SEASON 
OPENS NEXT MONDAT
Coach Wagner Will Be Home Sat
urday.
After practicing twice a day during 
the past Easter vacation the baseball 
team has finally rounded pretty well 
into form. Manager Pringle gives 
forth the good news that A1 Wagner 
will probably be back by next Satur
day to resume his coaching duties. 
Since the middle ofMarch he has 
been helping Clarke with the Pirates 
at Dawson Springs. Under his coach
ing the Plaid team ought to be most 
successful.
A week from Saturday the base
ball season opens with Juniata. The 
game ought to be a close one and 
will give us some idea of what the 
team can do. It is hard to tell ex
actly what the line-up will be, but 
a number of new faces will surely be 
seen.
Pra.ctice is held every afternoon and 
all candidates are expected to turn 
out regularly.

ANNUAL DESIGN 
JUNIOR SMOKER
Unique Events on Program.
The annual Junior Smoker of De
sign School w'as held in the architec
tural drafting room Thursday even
ing, March 25th with great success. 
A record-breaking crowd of three 
hundred fifty were present.
A stage was erected at one end of 
the large room and tables and chairs 
piled in the form of an amphitheatre 
before it. Red and Gold prevailed in 
decorations.
Henry Hornbostel was again 
crowned king of the assembly, and he 
with his Queen were a center of 
attraction during the whole evening, 
for at his demand everyone should 
agree. Quite a large number of 
sketches made up the programme as 
follows:

The smokes in all aspects was 
quite different than those of previous

that the next one shall surpass the 
past in every manner. The Junior 
Class as a whole was the committee 
headed by H. L. Heilman, chairman.
RADIO CLUB.
Willard put the kibosh on him; 
knocked out Johnson in the twentysixth round. This dispatch hurtling 
through space at 186,000 miles per 
second, from Key West, was received 
Monday afternoon by the Radio Club 
with Mr. Fletcher at the receiving 
end.
This is all the more remarkable be
cause of the fact that only a crude 
set was at hand. In fact all that was 
available was a few odds and ends that 
some of the members had brought to 
school.
DEAN (0NNEUE 
LEAYES EOR WEST
Gets Well Earned Leave of Absence.
Dean Connelley left Pittsburgh last 
Thursday evening for an extended vaca
tion in the west. His health has been 
failing during the past months and the 
Director and Board of Trustees, in rec
ognition of the notable service that he 
has rendered, granted the leave of ab
sence. Mr. Connelley is the senior dean 
of the Institute and is worthy of the 
courtesy thus extended him. He is 
accompanied by Mrs. Connelley and 
their daughter. He will be gone prob
ably until the early fall and is sure to 
be on hand for the opening of school 
in September.
He addressed the student Assembly 
of the School of Applied Industries on 
Wednesday before the Easter vacation, 
and the ovation that was given him wili 
certainly linger. He notified the stu
dents of his leaving and expressed his 
confidence in them to keep things go
ing during his absence. A number of 
the students who were fortunate enough 
to learn of the time of his boarding the 
train were at hand for the farewell.
A dinner was also given in his honor 
on Tuesday evening, March 30th, by 
the members of the Industries Faculty. 
Director Hamerschlag was present and 
spoke very feelingly on the work of 
Dean Connelley, and the progress of 
our school under his Leadership, anff 
bespoke on behalf of himself, the Board 
of Trustees, and the Faculty, hearty 
good wishes for his welfare on the trip. 
The faculty, through Professor Peters, 
presented the Dean with a token of their 
respect, which will be useful during 
the contemplated fishing expeditions. 
That Mr. Connelley appreciated the 
honor paid him goes without saying.
As far as is known of his plans, lie 
will locate in California, where the fam
ily will reside for the time. He has 
mapped out several trips through the 
mountains in quest of fish, but more 
particularly quietness. Heres hoping 
for a real vacation and a full regain of 
his health and strength for many more 
years of service.

ART FOR ARTS SAKE.
A School of the Drama That Lives 
Up to This Motto and 
Is Practical.
(By Charles M. Bregg.)
In these days of overwhelming com
mercialism the caption on this article 
sounds like a decayed joke. Paragraphists and jokesmiths, urged on by the con
tempt of the populace, have laughed 
the art of life out of court unless it 
brings quick returns in the way of coin. 
But, right here in Pittsburgh, and to a 
degree of excellence and completeness 
attained nowhere else in the world, to 
my knowledge, art is being cultivated 
for itself alone and for the esthetic and 
intellectual rewards which it brings to 
those who refuse to make a mere bucket 
shop of its riches. The dramatic sec
tion of the School of Design at the Car
negie School of Technology is unique 
in its foundations and scope. It is now 
proving that it is unique in its practi
cal results. I am afraid, like the proph
et of the proverb, the work being done 
by this great institution is less appre
ciated right here in Pittsburgh than in 
Singapore, or Moscow or Rome. Of 
the work that the School of Design is 
doing in behalf of the drama and in
struction in the arts of the theater I 
am sure there is but small comprehen
sion. Last Saturday night in the classic 
theater of the school, another unique 
feature, for no other educational in
stitution in the world has such a work
shop, the writer saw a performance of 
George Bernard Shaws clever satire, 
You Never Can Tell, that compared
in acting and stage essentials favorably 
with any professional production ever 
made in America. Arnold Daly gave 
us this comedy, well acted and carefully 
presented; but for the ordinary theatre
goer the production made by Prof. Ste
vens class, under the direction of B. 
Iden Payne, was just as clear in ex
position and as definite in humor as 
Mr. Dalys, when one considers the in
struments and time values used in the 
two performances. If this were a crit
ical review I might point out the var
ious collective and individual evidences 
of the truth of this assertion. It was 
astonishing to see and hear these young 
players grasp the inside of shaws 
somewhat attentuated satire, and dis
play its meaning in acting that rarely 
if ever blundered or became the crude 
efforts of amateurs. When Mr. Daly 
produced the comedy John Findley, one 
of the most seasoned character players 
on our stage, played the unctious gen
ial William, the waiter whose wisdom 
gives the play its title. On Saturday 
night young Frederick Steen did the 
role with a suavity, a sense of humor 
and a personal bearing that crowded 
Findleys interpretation pretty close. 
But all the players did relatively as fine 
work. It was a comforting exhibition 
of the practical results of using Art for 
Arts Sake.

March 17, 1915.
A REPLY.
March 26, 1915. 
Editor of the Tartan:
The suggestion offered in the next 
to the last issue of The Tartan with 
regard to military training in tech
nical schools is worthy of considera
tion of all of those concerned.
There is very much to praise in one 
who is imbued with the spirit of en
gineering, or one who believes that 
the engineer is to be the ruler of the 
physical world. But whether the en
gineer has the task of encouraging or 
developing the means of warfare re
mains quite doubtful. One may be 
inspired by the wonders of science 
as now displayed in the war zone. 
But that does not mean that the 
schools must endorse them as desir
able to the community whom they 
must serve. The application of sci
ence to militarism is anything but 
new. But it is necessary first to de
termine in whose interests militarism 
is bound to survive, and let that class 
alone bear its cost and consequences.
These are but a few remarks to the 
suggestions about the national Fac
tor of Safety, which may be prefer
ably called Factor of Ignorance.
An Anti-Militarist.
A LITTLE APPRECIATION!
Tartan Editor:
In the last issue of the Tartan 
there appeared a letter from a stu
dent severely censoring the manage
ment of the restaurant. Most of the 
attack was concentrated upon the socalled lack of service.
Now it is a well-known fact that 
when many classes are dismissed at 
the same time, a rush upon the res
taurant is inevitable. This rush is 
always well taken care of by the
management, and no one ever has to 
wait more than a few minutes at the 
most to be served. A little consider
ation and appreciation will do much 
more to constantly improve the serv
ice than a blunt inconsiderate knock.
In answer to the complaint thai 
exorbitant prices are charged for ex
tra helpings, we suggest first, that 
prices for extra helpings are no more 
than in other restaurants and may 
seem exorbitant to some by com
parison with the apparently impos~ 
sible low price charged for the regu
lar meal; and second, at least three 
possible reasons, to-wit: The food
value contained in each regular meal 
is carefully proportioned to obtain 
the most efficient results for the con
sumer.
Extra helpings mean overeating, re
sulting in decreased efficiency. Hence 
these charges may be made to dis
courage extra helpings. Secondly, if 
a price were placed on each dish, 
many students would pick certain 
dishes, instead of the best combina
tion as planned by Dr. Esquerre and 
Miss Adam. Thirdly, knowing the 
number of patrons, the management 
can by supplies most economically if 
they figure on certain dishes. Under 
a Pick what you like system this 
could not be done. The restaurant is 
now managed on a profitless basis. 
To be less economical would be di
rectly against the interests of those 
most concerned, the students.
In conclusion let us state that the 
restaurant we now have is a real 
blessing (and not a blessing in dis
guise either). Those who remember 
the old Beanery will agree with us. 
Like all new institutions it is not per
fect. However, it is constantly improving. The people in charge are 
working faithfully and conscientious
ly for us and we ought to appreciate 
it.

LETTERS FROM PROF. WURTS.
Honolulu, T. H. 
March 10, 1915.
To the Editors of the Tartan:
We arrived February 23rd in the 
middle of the annual carnival of 
flowers and good times. I could not 
see all the events, but those that I 
did see impressed me with the thor
oughness with which things were 
done. The outdoor operetta given by 
the students of Oahu College was the 
finest thing of its kind that I have 
ever seen. The water sports were, 
of course, marvels of grace and skill.
I was interested in an artificial erup
tion of the extinct crater, Punch
bowl, just behind the city. Though 
I had some doubts of the success of 
this undertaking, but in this, too, was 
agreeably surprised and impressed 
with the thoroughness and the scale 
on which things were done. Crude
oil was largely used in this perform
ance, although gun powder was a 
close second. There were three great 
lava flows down the sides of the 
crater. The front rim of which was 
all aglow and the bowl gave forth 
volumes of smoke accompanied by 
great explosions and fireworks. And 
all this was kept up for at least an 
hour.
We are located in a charming little 
bungalow, on the sea shore, about 
three miles from Honolulu. I take 
a plunge in the surf every morning 
before breakfast, and spend my days 
poking into everything I can find. 
There is no end to interesting things.
I climb these wonderful mountains 
and craters. The views are superb 
and the flora beautiful and full of in
terest, or I visit the Carnegie Library, 
Bishops museum, the Chinese quar
ters, the schools, the Army stations, 
the fortifications, the wireless station 
and then the surfboard riding is al
ways entertaining.
I have been especially interested in 
the schools both here and in Santa 
Barbara, because I found them so upto-date and progressive and they al
ways gave me something to think 
about. In Santa Barbara, where I 
visited the Normal School, for both 
men and women, I was much im
pressed with the grasp of detail which 
Miss Rich had, even in the mechani
cal departments. She showed me 
with rightful pride how perfectly her 
buildings were ventilated all due to 
an ingenious use of the trade winds. 
And then in the Recreation Center 
of the same city they had an audi
torium seating about 1,500 people in 
which the acoustics were perfect. 
This had been obtained by means of a 
secret arrangement of baffles in the 
ceiling. Whatever the secret may 
be the result was certainly wonderful. 
I spent a delightful hour with Miss 
West in Santa Barbara, listening to 
her experiences in Europe at the out
break of the war. The other day I 
attended a banquet given by the trus
tees of the Honolulu School for 
Boys. There were about one hun
dred guests present, among them 
Judge Dole, Ex-President of Hawaii. 
This school is partly military and the 
prevailing note there was respect for 
and obedience to law.
No wonder that these islands are 
called the Paradise of the Pacific. 
One glorious day follows (another 
with such regularity that snow and 
cold slush and rain, biting wind and 
irritating smoke are quickly forgot
ten. Even the servant question is 
left behind. All we had to do was 
to say that we wanted a Jappy and 
his wife and they were at the cottage 
when we arrived. They do every
thing from the laundry to boots with
out being told. The temperature now 
has been averaging 73 degrees F. 
and has been as high as 80 degrees F.
I have been invited to visit the 
great wireless station on the other 
side of the island next Saturday and 
will write about that next time.

The Editors of the Tartan,
Carnegie Tech:
After being here three weeks, and 
after poking into all kinds of things 
into mens affairs and natures affairs,
I begin to wonder what the great fas
cination of this placeof those 
islands really is. It cannot be the 
charm of the place. One is not at a 
loss to find this in other lands. It 
cannot be the wonderful foliage, the 
lovely flowers, the lofty and pictur
esque mountains, for these are not 
so uncommon. Perhaps it is the com
bination of all. But I am inclined 
to think it due more to a certain 
stimulation of ones imagination by 
the very location and construction or 
formation of the islands. How we 
are a speck of earth on top of a bit 
of porous rock, in the middle of the 
greatest ocean in the world. No 
doubt the foundations are good, but 
if they should give way, (and there 
are earthquakes and active volcanos 
here) it is 17,000 feet to the bottom! 
And then if one has any imagination 
at all, it is impossible to sit on the 
edge of a crateractive or inactive 
without picturing to oneself all that 
must have happened during the last 
thousands of years. Down in the 
crater there are great lava flows of 
wonderful and seemingly impossible 
construction  huge cinder cones, 
great caves, precipitous walk, death 
and awful silence. Imagination runs 
riot in the presence of such a spec
tacle. How did these things come 
to pass? When? and why? What 
did the scum look like? And then, 
over yonder there is a great smooth, 
round hill. Is that a cinder heap 
blown over by the trade winds? The 
rim of the crater is eliptical and at 
one end of the major axis there is a 
great head of rock and lava. Did 
the trade winds do this too? And 
have they been blowing just the same 
for all these thousands of years? And 
so, hundreds of questions and as 
many more marked pictures follow 
on another with bewildering rapidity 
until one is lost in the fascination of 
it all. And it is the same wherever 
you go. To the mountain tops or 
into the canyonsto the coral reefs, 
the surf-board riding or the great 
lava plainsin the jungle or on the 
seashore, there are stranger marvels

of M. M. C. S. are cordially invited to 
come, and it is hoped a large number 
of Tech students will take this op
portunity both to have a good time 
and to help a worthy cause.
There will be no general admission 
charged, but plenty of opportunity 
will be given to spend freely for side 
shows and good things to eat. Danc
ing will be one of the principal at
tractions, at 5c a dance, Gus Schnabel 
furnishing the music. Several expert 
fortune tellers will be present ready 
to tell any ones past, present or fu
ture for the small sum of ten cents. 
Quite a few side shows have been 
arranged for, the main ones being as 
follows: A spring fashion show, under 
the personal direction of Miss Ernst, 
showing the latest styles; the dresses 
being loaned by Kaufmans. The 
models have been carefully chosen 
from the school, and it is sure to be 
most attractive. At much labor and 
expense and with great difficulty we 
have succeeded in obtaining the larg
est donkey in the world. We can 
absolutely guarantee this, and for the 
nominal charge of 5c one may gaze 
on this wonderful and unique beast. 
The triplets will also be there and 
most charming they are: they never 
cry or fret, but always laugh and coo 
with delight. No carnival is com
plete without a iat lady and a 
thin lady, and so they, too, will add 
to the fun. Probably the thing of 
greatest interest to M. M. C. S. stu
dents will be the room where cari
catures of the faculty will be ar
ranged in the manner of a shooting 
gallery. Only instead of shooting, 
three balls will be sold for 5 cts. and 
the purchaser will then have the 
privilege of knocking down his fav
orite faculty member. Of course, if 
at first you dont succeed, one may 
always try, try againfor five cents. 
There will be booths where one may 
buy candy, lemonade, home-made 
cakes and jelly, while wandering 
thru the crowd will be the inevitable 
clown selling the necessary requisite 
to a carnival, gas filled balloons.
With this much of a description, it 
is hoped, many will be tempted to 
come to see more, and a good time is 
absolutely a sure thing. The invita
tion to all is to come early and to 
stay late. Many of the girls after 
staying for the afternoon expect to 
eat at the Beanery and meet friends 
later in the evening. This seems 
to be an excellent plan and 
men are urged to try it. Re
member the date: Wednesday, April 
14th, afternoon and evening.
LETTERS FROM PROF. WURTS
Continued from Page 3 
at every hand. (And perhaps the 
greatest of all iswhere did the na
tives come from and how did they 
get here?) These things demand 
explanation. The imagination is 
stimulated and one is held in the grip 
of the Hawaiian lion.
Honolulu, the capital of the Terri
tory, is a city of 60,000 people. It is 
situated on the southern and leeward 
side of the island of Oahu. In the 
residence portions are many hand
some homes, surrounded with luxuri
ant tropical trees, plants and flowers. 
The city is wonderfully clean. Traf
fic policemen regulate the crowding 
automobiles in the rather narrow 
streets of the business center. The 
street cars, motormen and conductors 
are the cleanest that I have ever 
seen (no exceptions) and the service 
reflects a good management. The 
telephone system is automatic and 
everybody speaks of it in terms of 
highest praise. It is quite certain 
that Central will never again find 
a place in Honolulu. The water in 
many of the private houses and pub
lic buildings is heated by the sun. 
A black mud, shallow, metal tank is 
placed on the roof under a glass 
frame and connected the same as a 
water back. A fifty gallon tank is in
stalled complete for $90.00. The tem
perature of the water on a sunny day 
is 135 degrees F. On a dull day (I 
have not seen any yet) the water is 
said to be luke warm. These sunheaters are used for bath room and 
kitchen. It makes one wonder what 
use might be done with this ever
lasting sun, and again the imagina
tion is stimulated. Oh, ye Hawaiian 
Islands!!
Would be glad to see the Tartan 
out here with back numbers to Feb
ruary 1st. We sail from here May 
19th.

can Association of Collegiate Regis
trars will be held at the University of 
Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, on 
April 20, 21, and 22. The sessions of 
the three days will be devoted largely 
to open conference and round table 
work on the problems of the regis
trars office. The speakers will in
clude a representative of the Bureau 
of Education in Washington.
The officers of the Association are: 
President, George O. Foster of the

AT THE GRAND.
The engagement of Evelyn Nesbit 
Thaw and Jack Clifford in vaudeville 
at the Grand Opera House is to be
gin on Monday afternoon, April 12. 
It will be the first time Miss Nes
bit has been here as an attraction in 
the varieties in this city and the sec
ond time she has appeared here in 
any sort of production within recent 
years. The entertainment which she 
and Mr. Clifford will present is de
scribed as a Novel Arrangement of 
Songs and Dancing and is designed 
to set forth the noted young womans 
cleverness as a dancer, her personal 
beauty and the charm of her vocal 
attainments. Around this prominent 
headline feature, Mr. Davis is book
ing other attractions of the first class. 
He announces the premier in Pitts
burgh of Lottie Collins, Jr., daugh
ter of the famous Lottie Collins who 
made the whole world dance to the 
haunting melody of Ta Ra Ra Boom 
De Aye. Miss Collins is a sister 
of Jose Collins, one of the most fas
cinating English comediennes who 
has been in America for several sea
sons, and, like this sister, inherits the 
insoucience and vivacious manners of 
their talented mother. Harry B. Les
ter, the jovial jester, will give his im
pressions of distinguished stage stars. 
James Diamond and Sibyl Brennen 
will play Nifty Nonsense. Robert 
L. Dailey and his supporting com
pany wil play Our Bob. Meehans 
canines, a troupe of educated animals, 
will entertain with wonderful athletic 
performances, while various other 
vaudeville attractions and moving 
pictures will complete Mr. Davis ex
cellent program.

NEWS FROM WAR ZONE.
March 24, 1915. 
The Editor of the Tartan:
The following extracts from a let
ter written by an Englishman in the 
Royal Army Medical Corps may be 
interesting as giving a picture of one 
phase of life at the front.
Yours truly,
Arnold W. Lahee. 
Belgium, Feb. 5, 1915.
* * * Our postman has just
gone off to fetch the last three or four 
days mailsthe delay is due to our 
having been on the move. We left 
our nice billet last Monday and have 
moved up to the fighting.
Our brigade has been in action in 
the trenches a day or two now. We 
are in a town, the name of which you 
know very well, as it is constantly 
named in our papers. I wish I could 
tell you where it isthe town is ab
solutely in ruins.
It is wicked work that has been 
done here. A Cathedral and a fine 
Town Hall smashed to atoms. We 
have got our hospital in a fine big 
building which is partly smashed up, 
too. German Taube aeroplanes are 
constantly over us, and it is great 
sport watching them being shelled, 
but up to the present I have not seen 
one brought down.
Of course the booming of guns has 
changed to bangs followed often by 
the funny noise of shells sailing 
through the air.
My first night here was spent on 
doing night guard on the Reservoir 
for our water supply with an armed 
French sentry for company. I tried 
to get some sleep before going on 
for my turn, but the din and rattle of 
gun and rifle fire was such that we 
could not sleep. When I came off 
my two hours, things had quieted 
down a bit and we were able to get 
some sleep.
Last night I was lucky enough to 
be in the party that went out on the 
job of our real workviz. clearing the 
field of the wounded. We went off 
about seven oclock and went to 
what are called the regimental aid 
posts of the different regiments. 
This is the spot to which the regi
mental stretcher-bearers bring the 
wounded and hand them over to us 
they are quite close to the supporting 
trenches.
While waiting to go up with our 
stretchers to the first post, three 
shells came whizzing over our heads 
and burst in our rear. We learned 
afterwards that the Germans were 
shelling the road we had just come 
up, in the hope of smashing it up 
so as to make it bad for our carts, 
etc. Luckily they missed the road, 
so that our motor-ambulance had a 
clear run home. At our second aid 
post we had spent rifle shots pass us 
now and again.
Here we spent quite a long time. 
Eventually we filled our motors and 
some of us marched back through 
the townand this was a sight we 
could hardly forget in a hurryall 
the ruined houses and deserted streejts 
all made more impressive by the 
moonlight.
We are spending today very
quietly restinga party of nine which 
I was with not having got home again 
till 4:30 A. M. During the day we 
passed last nights wounded on to 
the rear, so having a clear house to 
repeat last nights performance to
nightand so our time is likely to 
passout all night collecting wound
ed, getting up fairly late in the morn
ing and passing the wounded back to 
the rear during the day.
I wonder how much of my letters 
you can read when they reach you. 
I am careful not to mention names 
etc. I never know what sort of 
things the censor will strike out.
If you ever send a parcel out again, 
could you fill in the corners with 
cards of bachelors buttons, also if 
you use any inside wrappings use the 
latest newspapersthey come in 
handy for reading. January 25 is I 
think, the last paper I have read.
I have got two souvenirs so far 
some shrapnel-bullets picked up in a 
battle-field and a French bullet. As 
for Germanshave not sighted so 
much as the top of a helmet yet. I 
have seen their shells burst though!
CAPACITY AND INDUCTION
Continued from Page 1 
the oscillations necessary for wave 
formation.
In order to get a wave train we 
must have the oscullator vibrating at 
a definite frequency, also the inertia 
of the vibrating parts is a great fac
tor in the producing of vibrations. 
The two things necessary then are 
elasticity and inertia.
Dr. Grondahl illustrated the effect 
of electrical inertia or induction by 
means of a coil connected in parallel 
with a light. When the current is 
turned on the lamp glows very 
brightly but diminishes to a steady 
value below this.
The elasticity or restoring force 
was shown by means of a simple con
denser. The potential difference be
tween the two plates sets up a stress 
similar to that set up in a pendulum 
which has been pulled to one side. 
When the stress in either case is re
lieved a vibration is set up.
The nature of the oscillations was 
shown very clearly by means of a 
notching mirror which projected the 
back and forth motions upon the 
wall. Dr. Grondahl also showed very 
clearly how forced or sympathetic 
the vibrations could be set up elec
trically and also showed the standing 
waves on a long inductance.
The climax of the lecture, however, 
was the whistling arc, which behaved 
very well. This consists of an in
duction of 1 millinen in series with 
a capacity of 8 micofarads. The in
ductance is arranged so that it may 
be varied and across the whole, an 
arc is connected, fed by an outside 
source. With different portions of 
the inductions in, a different tone is 
produced and if the right ones are 
found, any tune may he piayed.
Dr. Grondahl finished the lecture 
by playing two classical selections, 
namely: Yankee Doodle and Tip
perary, which were very well ren
dered and scored a big hit with the 
audience.

THE TENNIS SCHEDULE.
This years tennis schedule has fin
ally been completed and appears to 
be one of the most difficult the team 
has ever had. The schedule is as 
follows:
May 3 and 4Geneva at Tech.
May 6Penn State at Tech.
May 12 or 14Grove City at Tech. 
May 18Michigan at Tech.
May 21 or 22Grove City at Grove
City.
May 26Pitt at Tech.
May 28 or 29Geneva at Beaver
Falls.
Although there is, as yet, a little 
uncertainty about a couple of the 
dates, the above order is almost cer
tain.
Of course at such an early time it 
is hard to tell just exactly what the 
prospects for the team are. This 
year there is a scarcity of veterans, 
due to graduation. As a result the 
team will practically be built from 
new men. Nevertheless there seems 
to be a wealth of new material on 
hand. These men have all had a 
great deal of experience before com
ing to Carnegie, and after rounding 
into form ought to make up a team 
of considerable strength.
Within a week or so the courts 
will have been put into condition. 
Practice began in the gymnasium last 
Monday at 4:30 with a promising 
looking bunch present.
COMPLIMENTS FOR ROESSING.
A highly gratifying article appear
ed in the Lyceum Index for April, 
in regard to the work done by C. A. 
Roessing, 15, a member of Industrial 
Teachers course, School of Applied 
Industries. Mr. Roessing has been 
teaching a class in mechanical draft
ing for the first two years at night 
at the De Sales Lyceum, McKees 
Rocks. Twenty-six men were en
rolled in course during the past year. 
Their work will be on exhibition at 
McKees Rocks on the evening of 
April 25th.
The faculty of Southwestern Uni
versity have come out in favor of

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
CLASS B CHARETTE.
Quite a large number of promising 
projets and orders are participat
ing in this charette. We should pull 
the greater part of the judgment to 
Carnegie. It is up to us. Let us 
try hard.
THE NEW WINGS.
The new wings to design school 
have been started and hope to be 
ready for occupancy next fall. The 
north wing will contain the new li
brary, architectural drafting room, 
musical studios and class rooms. The 
south wing a chamber of musicex
tension to stagea rehearsal room, 
water color, etc., rooms, studios for 
department of illustration, etc., club 
room, etc. This is the last and final 
addition to Design School, whose en
rollment in the future shall be lim
ited.
DESIGN MEETING.
A meeting of Design School was 
held last Tuesday to decide upon a 
suitable date and kind of spring fes
tival we intend to put through. The 
affair wras left in the hands of a com
mittee for the present.
PENNSYLVANIA RECEIVES 
LETTERS FROM ENGLISH 
UNIVERSITIES.
Oxford and Cambridge Will Not Be 
Represented at Relay Races This 
Season. 
Abandon Sports in England.
The Relay management received 
two interesting letters from Eng
land. Norman Taber, the fam
ous mile runner, wTrote from Oxford 
and gave his impression of conditions 
there, while J. H. Gray, Honorary 
Treasurer of Cambridge Athletic 
Club, gave in a more extended way 
reasons why it is impossible for the 
English colleges to be represented 
at Pennsylvanias Relays. The condi
tions at both universities are very 
much the same. The great majority 
of the students have volunteered for 
the war, and many of them are al
ready at the front. Tabers letter is 
very gloomy. As far as Oxford is 
concerned, athletics are absolutely 
dead this season. The following is 
the letter from Mr. Taber:
It is indeed difficult to write cheer
fully about athletic conditions here in 
England this year. Since the present 
term began I have tried to see if I 
could not get a few men to come 
down to the track, but all the ablebodied Englishmen have left and the 
best I have been able to do is to get 
about four men to come down, and 
these could scarcely be called ath
letes. Thus you can see that condi
tions are pretty poor, and it is im
possible to attempt any competition 
even among the various Oxford col
leges. I have not been able to go up 
to Cambridge, but I judge conditions 
there are the same. It is certainly
too bad that we are unable to send 
any representatives from either uni
versity after you have so cordially in
vited us. Next year, if the war is 
over, as many think it will be, I hope 
We shall be able to accept an invita
tion if otie is tendered to us. I shall 
be glad to write you at any time 
about prospects over here, and I trust 
we shall have better conditions here 
soon. Jackson, Caussen and Sproule 
are all still in England, but expect to 
go to the front about the first of 
April.
A letter from Mr. Gray is even 
more interesting. Athletes all over 
the world will take a pride in the pa
triotism shown by the Englishmen at 
Cambridge and Oxford. The reading 
of the following letter will probably 
bring attention to the real serious
ness of the situation abroad.
MR. GRAYS LETTER.
The letter of Mr. J. H. Gray, Hon
orary Treasurer, is as follows:
Your letter, dated February 12, 
was placed in my hands yesterday. 
Your previous letter must, I think, 
have miscarried. At all events, I 
have heard nothing of it. I recollect 
very well the invitation wh'ch you 
were kind enough to extend to Cam
bridge last year. Mr. Macintosh na
turally consulted me about ii, and we 
were quite prepared to edeem our
1. remise and send a team tor your Re
lay Races this spring. But th* war 
hase made this quite impossible.
I wonder if you realize the posi
tion here. Out of 3,600 students, 2,- 
400 are away on service. There is 
not, I am proud to say, a single run
ning Blue left in Cambridge. They 
are every one of them serving the 
country. There are no sports; all our 
contests with Oxford are abandoned. 
The very running ground is in use by 
the troops in training here.
The above letters indicate that the 
war has definitely destroyed any pros
pects of Cambridge or Oxford being 
here this season. At the same time, 
it gives assurance that under ordi
nary conditions both of these uni
versities will plan to be annual par
ticipants in Pennsylvanias famous an
nual events. Everyone will recognize 
the necessity which keeps the Eng
lish athletes from coming over this 
season. Wre shall, therefore, have to 
wait until 1916 before having a chance 
to see such another race as the fourmile relay between Oxford and Penn
sylvania last year.The Pennsyl
vanian.
Allegheny College has set aside one 
week to celebrate the hundredth an
niversary of its founding.
Sophomore at Stanford University 
have been persistent in throwing 
freshmen into the lake. Hearing of 
their deeds, Grace Darling, a movie 
artist, offered the reward of a kiss to 
the freshman who would take a duck
ing in her presence. The freshmen 
needed no coaxing and the first one 
there was served accordingly. He 
claimed his coveted reward before a 
crowd of school mates and a moving 
picture machine of Miss Darlings 
company.
THE DAVIS.
One of the cleverest comedies 
which has been given to the stage 
for a great many years, The Third 
Party, will be offered at the Davis 
Theatre, for the week beginning April 
12th. This comedy has been tried, 
tested and in no way found wanting. 
It came up to every expectation. It 
has a glorious record in Pittsburgh, 
having been presented here first in 
April, 1914, and in January of the 
present year, both times being on 
view at the Alvin Theatre.
The play was built for laughing 
purposes only, and audiences at the 
Alvin Theatre actually growing tired 
of laughing, so humorous was the 
play. It is swift and merrythe lines 
bristling with epigrams and pungent 
wit. Oftentimes the players were 
compelled to stop until the audience 
could get its breath again so funny 
is the comedy. All the daily papers 
in Pittsburgh said of it that it was 
the funniest comedy that had ever 
been seen on any stage in this city. 
This was, in truth, the unanimous 
verdict of all the critics connected 
with the local press.
A CENSUS OF UNIVERSITIES.
The development of vocational and 
technical departments in the univer
sities has been so rapid and unequal 
that few persons would be able to tell 
which are the largest schools in each 
field. If the reader thinks himself 
well informed let him take the fol
lowing quiz:
Which has the largest law school? 
Harvard, followed by New York and 
Michigan.
Which has the largest medical 
school? New York, followed by 
Michigan and John Hopkins.
Which has the largest divinity 
school? Northwestern, followed by 
Chicago and Yale.
Which has the largest engineering 
school? Illinois, followed by Cornell 
and Michigan.
Which has the largest non-professional graduate school? Columbia, 
followed by Chicago and Harvard.
Which has the largest school of
education? Columbia, followed by
Pittsburgh and New York.
Which has the largest school of
agriculture? Cornell, followed by
Wisconsin and Ohio.
Which has the largest school of
commerce? New York, followed by 
Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh.
Which has the largest school of
journalism? Columbia, followed by
New York and Wisconsin.
Which has the largest school of
architecture? Cornell, followed by 
Michigan and Columbia.
Which has the largest body of un
dergraduate students? California, fol
lowed by Harvard (including Radcliff) and Michigan.University
Daily Kansan.
Northwestern University has spent 
$5,000,000 in building a quadrangle 
fraternity and non-fraternity dormi
tories. The plan has been very suc
cessful.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
CHANGES MADE IN FOOTBALL 
RULES.
Y! K!EGIK!N GKEGEWEGIK
MHO CLUB HAS BIG TIME.
On Wednesday evening, March 24, 
the Mho Club held one of the best 
affairs yet. This was a social meet
ing held in the Science Club Room. 
Profs. Work and Dennison were pres
ent and Mr. Van Dyck came in later.
A short business meeting was held 
at the beginning. Mr. Moore, of the 
Dance Committee, said the dance 
would be held April 9 in the Union 
and the tax would be 75 cents. After 
a few discussions, the program of the 
evening was entered upon.
Mr. Ettle spoke on the Mho Club, 
Past, Present and Future, and gave 
some very good pointers on increas
ing the efficiency of the club. Mr. 
Dudley, the Past Chairman of Pitts
burgh section of the A. I. E. E., then 
gave a few words on the organiza
tion of a student branch at Tech. Mr. 
Dudley gave us a good idea of the 
benefits derived from association with 
the Institute and no doubt action will 
be started for the organization of a 
Student branch.
After this, a little musical program 
was furnished by Messrs. Porky 
Handleman and Steinmetz Einstein, 
which was enjoyed by all. The flow
ing bowl in the form of a cider 
barrel was passed around quite fre
quently and garnished with life pre
servers made everyone enjoy him
self.
Mr. D. S. Trautman then showed 
some pictures taken when he made 
the trip with the big fleet, and ex
plained how the beer gardens

MHO CLUB PLANS BIG SEASON.
The Mho Club Baseball Team is 
being organized rapidly and there is 
promise of an A-l team this season. 
Mr. C. V. Doherty, the Athletic Di
rector of the Club, expresses hopes 
for nothing less than the school 
championship.
Games are desired with any other 
class team or club team. Anyone de
siring games see Mr. Doherty at their 
earliest convenience. This applies to
C. M. E. S., Fulcrum Club, Crucible 
Club, Draftsman Club and Architects 
Club.
In order to celebrate the winning 
of the conference championship in 
basketball, the students at Denver 
University declared themselves free 
from school cares and struck. The 
faculty has not yet made known their 
plans of celebrating the strike.
Yale is said to possess the best 
equipped and most extensive crew 
quarters of any university in Ameri
ca. This is the first university of the 
east to equip so elaborately for this 
form of sport. Their new addition 
cost $75,000.
The following is the list of changes 
in the football rules made by the 
Rules Committee in New York, Feb
ruary 5 and 6, 1915.
By pasting these various paragraphs 
in your 1914 Rule Book at the pages 
indicated you will have your book re
vised to date. The 1915 Rule Book 
will not come out until July.
Page 98, Rule III, Sec. 2.Substi
tutes must report IMMEDIATELY 
to the Referee or Umpire. Communi
cating with members of their team 
before so doing will be regarded as 
coaching.
Page 98, Rule III, Sec. 2.Players 
withdrawn from play may be returned 
to play only during an intermission 
between two succeeding quarters. 
(This return to the rule of 1912 has 
been made necessary by the abuse 
made by coaches of the privilege of 
returning players at any time during 
the last period.)
Page 99, Rule II, Sec. 3.The Rules 
Committee recommends that all play
ers upon each side be conspicuously 
numbered, no two numbers upon the 
same team being the same.
Page 102, Rule VI, Sec. 2.The ball 
is not snapped back until it has left 
the possession of the snapper-back. 
(This change is aimed to prevent a 
questionable class of plays in which 
the snapper-back put the ball in play 
but retained possession of it by con
cealing it momentarily between his 
legs.)
Page 106, Rule VI, Sec. (d).This 
section is re-worded for clearness as 
follows: When a kicked ball (ex
cept when one scoring a goal) strikes 
the opponents gqal post or bar be
fore being touched by a player of 
either side or when a kicked ball, ex
cept one from a kick-off, or free-kick, 
goes over opponents goal line before 
being touched by a player of either 
side. (This defines one of the in
stances in which the ball is dead.)
Page 107, Rule VI, Sec. 15, Par. 3. 
The Touchback which arises when a 
player, being off-side and within his 
opponents 10-yard line, touhces the 
ball, may be declined by the offended 
side. (Such declination obviously 
would occur when the offended side 
on the play had succeeded in running 
the ball beyond their 20-yard line, 
upon which the Touchback, if not 
declined, would place the ball.)
Page 108, Rule VI, Sec. 16.Insert 
the following: It is a safety if a
team puts the ball in play and com
mits a foul behind their goal and the 
distance penalty ensuing would neces
sitate their putting the ball down for 
the next scrimmage at a point behind 
their goal line. (This new declara
tion of a safety is designed to cover 
a rare but possible occurrence.)
Page 118, Rule XIII. Add to this 
Rule the words or the player punt
ing out. (This rule defines the play
ers who may be out of bounds and 
heretofore did not include the punter 
out, thus making the written rule now 
conform to actual practice.)
Page 127, Rule XVIII, Sec. 1.

(This is the rule covering accidental 
passing of the ball backward out of 
bounds by the snapper-back.) To this 
rule also add a note as follows: This 
play shall count as a down if recov
ered by the passers side.
Page 127, Rule XVIII, Sec. 7.If 
the ball having been touched by an 
eligible player of the side making a 
forward pass is touched by a second 
eligible player of that side, while the' 
ball still is in the air, the play shall be 
deemed an incomplete forward pass. 
(Heretofore such a play has been pen
alized as provided in this rule, but 
as such a play usually is accidental, 
such penalizing is unduly severe and 
so has been abrogated.)
Page 130, Rule XVIII. Add a new 
section: If an incompleted forward
pass, and an off-side play by oppon
ents, occur on the same down, the off
side play shall be penalized, and the 
incompleted forward pass shall not 
count as a down.
Page 130, Rule XVIII, Sec. 8.If 
the ball after having been legally 
passed forward goes out of bounds it 
shall be an incomplete forward pass. 
(This change is intended to prevent a 
team from intentionally throwing a 
forward pass out of bounds in lieu 
of making a punt and it applies to any 
forward pass whether upon the fly, or 
bound, or having been previously 
touched. Heretofore the ball if on 
the fly went to opponents at the 
point where the ball crossed the side 
line. Hereafter it will merely go as 
an incompleted forward pass but on 
the last down will go to opponents at 
the spot of the down.)
Page 130, Rule XVIII, Sec. 8.Add 
a note: The position of the feet of
a player catching a forward pass, and 
not the po-sition of the ball, determine 
whether or not a forward pass is
caught out of bounds.
Page 130, Rule XVIII, Sec. 2.
Running into the player who has
kicked the ball shall be penalized by 
a loss of 15 yards. Roughing the 
player who has kicked the ball shall 
be penalized by disqualification as 
heretofore. (This change recognizes 
that the kicker occasionally is run 
into unintentionally and without fla
grant roughness. Heretofore this was 
penalized by disqualification unler 
roughing. This penalty was be
lieved to be too severe and so a dis
tinction has been made between run
ning into the kicker and roughing 
him.
Pafe 134, Rule XXIII.Add a new 
section: If a player of the side in
possession of the ball unnecessarily 
runs into a player of the other side, 
after the whistle has blown, the of
fenders side shall be penalized by the 
loss of 10 yards measured from the 
point where the ball was declared 
dead. (This is intended to meet a 
practice which has recently arisen of 
unnecessarily running into the sec
ondary defenders, immediately after 
the cessation of play, thereby inviting

roughness.)
Page 134, Rule XXIII, Sec. 5.If a 
player in the open rises his foot 
higher than his knee and thereby 
strikes an opponent it shall be re
garded as unnecessary roughness and 
shall be penalized by the loss of 15 
yards. (This is intended to prevent 
an end rush from pivoting upon one 
foot and swinging the other around 
in an outstretched position so as to 
strike the tackle or an opposing back 
coming through and it also is intend
ed to prevent players while lying upon 
the ground, in the open, from 
swinging their feet about in the air

for the purpose of interfering with 
opponents who happen to be within 
reach. The distinction of in the 
open has been made, following the 
analogy of hurdling, so as not to pen
alize the players in the center of the 
line who unintentionally and helpless
ly are occasionally thrown into the 
same position.)

E3ftJ;s
penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct 
shall be the loss of IS yards by the 
offending side, in addition to which 
in flagrant cases the offending player 
or players may be disqualified. (This 
is intended to recognize varying de
grees of such conduct and to provide 
suitable penalties. Hitherto offend
ing players have been suspended for 
the remainder of the game, which in 
some instances has been regarded as 
unduly severe.)

*' Page 136, Rule XXIV, Sec. 1.The 
~Rules Committee strongly deprecates 
the use of substitutes for purposes of 
side-line coaching, as this is against 
the best interests of the game and 
sport.
Page 139, Rule XXVI.The offi
cials of the game shall consist of a 
Referee, an Umpire, a Field Judge 
and a Linesman. The use of a Field 
Judge thereby has been made compul
sory on account of the growth of for
ward passing and the inability of 
three officials to cover the present 
game.
Page 140.Add a new section. The 
Field Judge shall keep the time.
The Rules Committee decided to es
tablish a new section of the rules to 
be known as APPROVED RUL
INGS. Under this head will be in
cluded rulings hereafter made by the 
Committee upon doubtful points un
der existing rules. The committee 
laid down the following rulings: 
APPROVED RULINGS.
If a forward pass is caught simul
taneously by an eligible player of the 
passing side and by an opponent the 
possession of the ball shall belong to 
the side which put the ball in play.
Contesting teams may not waive 
Rule XXIV, Sec. 4, prohibiting any 
one from walking up and down the 
side-lines.
If a member of the side kicking 
the ball touches, or is touched by the 
ball, while off-side, the ball is not 
automatically dead. Play may ensue 
and the penalty may be declined.
On the kick-off if the ball does not 
go ten yards towards the opponents 
goal it is a loose ball, and as such 
may not be kicked while upon the 
ground.
If a player is illegally substituted 
but the illegal substitution is detected 
before play ensues such substitution, 
notwithstanding, is to be penalized 
as an actual legal substitution.
If a player of one team, (A) sig
nals for a fair catch, and an opponent 
team (B) is pushed into the player 
so signalling by another member of 
team (A) the play shall go as a fair 
catch but no distance penalty shall be 
applied.
If two players signal for a fair 
catch and the ball is touched by one 
of these players but caught by the 
other, before it touches the ground, 
no run shall be allowed but the ball 
shall be dead and must be put in play 
by a scrimmage, at the point where 
caught, under Rule VI, Sec. 5.
The following CORRECTIVE 
CHANGES also were made in the 
rules. These changes do not alter 
present methods of play but merely 
change the verbiage in certain rules 
for the purpose of clearness.The
