While thousands of miles 
away a crisis unfolds in the 
Baltic region, some members of 
the CMU community are start
ing to take notice of the issues 
in and around Kosovo.
Last Wednesday, Student 
Pugwash held a meeting about
the crisis, stating that there was 
not enough discussion on campus 
regarding Kosovo. Ten people 
attended, including a frequent 
guest speaker at the Pugwash 
meetings, Benoit Morel, profes
sor of engineering and public 
policy and physics.
The meeting included back
ground information on the roots 
of conflict on the Baltic situation,
including the role of Yugoslavian 
leader Slobodan Milosevic.
There is a discrepancy be
tween our view and the Serbs 
point of view, said Morel at the 
meeting, while addressing the 
problems involved in Milosevics 
actions and Serbian reaction to 
U.S. bombings.
One question that came up was 
whether the Kosovo conflict com
pared to other wars. In this case, 
Morel said that he was concerned 
over the lack of a U.N. resolu
tion, andNATO being dominated 
by the U.S. NATO is [being] 
used as a conduit for a coordi
nated effort .against someone 
else, he said.
Others questioned why the U.S. 
had picked Kosovo as the region

Wonder Boys is coming back to 
CMU one last time, but Para
mount Pictures will pay a price 
for their final visit today.
Last Tuesday, a special meet
ing was held between Student 
Government officers and Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy 
to decide on a last-minute re
quest from Paramount Pictures 
to allow one more day for Wonder 
Boys filming on campus.
The request was initially denied, 
but after Paramount offered a com
pensation fee to CMU students, 
Don Hale, vice president of Uni
versity Relations, made the deci
sion to consult the student body.
I wanted to make sure that 
students were comfortable with 
our decision to allow Wonder Boys 
to come back, said Hale.
The compensation fee was origi
nally proposed at $25,000, but at 
another meeting Tuesday 
evening which included members 
of Student Government and indi
viduals representing Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC) and the 
Carnival Committee, the fee was 
raised to $40,000.
According to Charles Anthe, 
chair of Student Senate and a 
senior electrical and computer en
gineering major, the filming had 
to be completed Monday because 
Michael Douglas was eager to 
finish the project. In addition, 
next week is GSIAs 50-year an
niversary, and the filming would 
be too much of an inconvenience.
Anthe and Dominic Falso, a
senior physics major from SDC, 
drafted a letter afterwards that 
was sent to the entire student 
body, asking whether Wonder 
Boys should come back or not, 
and if so what the money should 
go towards. All of the money will 
be going to benefit students at 
one point, said Anthe.
The results showed that 82.8% 
of students who replied to the 
email voted to allow Wonder Boys 
back, and 17.2% voted no, with a 
total of 2652 students voting. 
Anthe said that he received vari
ous comments on the disruptions 
and suggestions for how to spend 
the money.
The proposal will distribute 
$5,000 each to H&SS and CFA 
departments, $5,000 to Sweep
stakes, and $25,000 to the stu
dent body.
According to Sarah Gross, stu
dent body president and a junior 
in social history, there will prob
ably be an ad hoc committee 
formed by Student Goverment to 
investigate how to spend the 
$25,000. Student organizations 
and students will be allowed to 
submit proposals to the commit
tee on what they feel the money 
should be spent on.
The $5,000 to CFA and H&SS 
will be used to compensate for 
the disruptions in those colleges. 
Hale said the film caused sev
eral scheduling problems for the 
University. We scheduled 
things, and schedules changed. 
That made it very tough to let 
people know what was going to 
happen.... It was very disrupPlease see FILMING, page 3

in different ways. Its a nice change of 
pace from CMU and will present a new

For admission into SEA semester you 
must have completed one college-level

lent, according to Gina Rullo, a SEA 
Admission Counselor. There are Deans 
SEA Merit Scholarships that are $5,000 
each. This award is usually available to 
one academically qualified student in 
each SEA class, said Rullo. This year, 
however, we had many qualified appli
cants, so we chose two students to re
ceive the award.
Rullo said that many people apply to 
this program each year. If you are in 
good academic standing and you are 
inquisitive, adventuresome, and moti
vated, we encourage you to apply, said 
Rullo. You should be eager to learn in a 
challenging environment that stresses 
cooperation, sensitivity to others, and 
adaptability to changing conditions, and 
no sailing experience is necessary.

U.S. refuses trade 
for NATO prisoners
WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. mili
tary leaders mulled what to do with a 
Yugoslav prisoner of war Saturday, 
but it appeared unlikely that the lieu
tenant would be traded for three 
American soldiers seized near the 
Macedonian border two weeks ago.
Officials in Belgrade have given no 
hint of being interested in a trade. 
Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevics government has said noth
ing about it publicly and has not even 
reported the officers capture to the 
Yugoslav people.
Meanwhile, a Pentagon briefer said 
the F-16 pilot who discussed his attack 
on a convoy did not accidentally bomb 
refugees, as NATO had suggested in 
releasing an audiotape of his account.
Id just like to make clear now that 
that F-16 pilot on the audiotape is not 
thought to be responsible in any way 
for anything other than the attack 
that he described on a military ve
hicle, said Navy Capt. Steve 
Pietropaoli. I am saying that the 
pilot in the audiotape... hit a military 
vehicle and if a NATO briefer sug
gested otherwise then that is not 
accurate as I understand the facts. 
However, Pietropaoli said that did 
not mean there was not an accidental 
attack on civilians in the area. It 
appears to be that that may be the 
case, he said.
He said if there was such an inci
dent, the F-16 pilot heard on the widely 
broadcast tape  apparently a U.S. 
flier, but not identified  was not 
responsible. He said the pilot on the 
tape is still flying missions.
Pietropaoli said he had not spoken 
with NATO officials about why they 
choose to run that tape.... Some people, 
I think in all sincerity and earnest
ness tried to get information out 
sooner than that information was 
verified or available, and the result 
has been 72 hours of confusion, rather 
than 72 hours of clarity.
Tradingthe captured Yugoslav officer 
with the three American POWs would 
be a politically tricky equation, defense
officials said, on condition of anonymity. 
On one hand, they said, release of the 
U.S. soldiers would be a relief, but it 
would cany the risk of equating what the 
UnitedStates calls an abduction of peace
keeping soldiers with the capture of a 
bona fide enemy POW.
The officer, the only Yugoslav taken 
prisoner thus far in the three-week 
campaign, was captured by the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army and turned 
over to the Albanian government, 
which in turn gave him to the United 
States. His treatment, which included 
a visit from two representatives of the 
Switzerland-based International Com
mittee of the Red Cross, is in stark 
contrast to the experience of the 
American captives, spokesman 
Michael Doubleday said.
Doubleday said he had no details on 
how the officer was captured, and that 
the incident does not mean NATO is 
working closely with the KLA. The alli
ance has tried to keep an arms-length 
distance from the guerrilla force, al
though Doubleday said there are occa
sional contacts through intermediaries.
U.S. News & World Report in its new 
issue quoted unidentified sources as say
ing U.S. officials have held secret talks 
with the KLA and that the administra
tion is rethinking its ties to the group.
In Brussels, Belgium, a NATO 
spokesman displayed reconnaissance 
photographs Saturday that may show 
new mass graves inside Kosovo, a south
ern Serbian province whose population 
was until several weeks ago 90 percent 
ethnic Albanian. Hundreds of thou
sands of refugees have fled Serb forces 
in Kosovo in recent weeks.
A Newsweek poll released Saturday 
showed continued public support for 
the airstrikes coupled with an interest 
in negotiating an end to the conflict. 
The poll showed 52 percent of 751 
adults surveyed said diplomatic ef
forts aimed at a settlement should be 
the top priority for NATO and the 
United States. The poll taken April 
15-16 has a margin of error of plus or 
minus four percentage points.
Murder conviction 
may be vacated
BOSTON (AP)  A man who spent 
more than three years in prison for a 
1995 killing has been released by au
thorities who say he may have been 
wrongly convicted.
A jury in October 1996 convicted 
Marlon Passley of first-degree murder 
for the killing of 18-year-old Tennyson 
Drakes, who was shot in the head. 
Passley was sentenced to fife in prison.
But after authorities learned of new 
information, prosecutors on Wednesday 
petitioned a judge on the Supreme Judi
cial Court to stay his sentence. On Fri
day, the judge complied and Passley, 
now 26, was released.
Jim Borghesani, spokesman for the 
Suffolk County district attorneys office, 
said that prosecutors and police learned 
two weeks ago that it was probable Passley 
did not commit the crime. Authorities 
refused to discuss the new evidence.
To not do something would have been 
unethical and possibly illegal, said Bos
ton Police Lt. Detective Paul Farrahar.
In a statement, Passleys attorneys 
said that he was enormously grateful 
for his freedom.
Marlon Passley has always main
tained his innocence since his arrest in 
this case, said MarkHorrigan, Passleys 
trial attorney, and Mary Rogers, who 
handled Passleys appeal. He hopes that 
the investigation will lead to the real 
murderer being prosecuted.
Drakes family has been notified of 
Passleys release and the investigation 
is ongoing, Borghesani said.
Potentially, Passleys conviction could 
be vacated, said David Meier, chief as
sistant district attorney.
Court finds school 
program flawed
BEAUMONT, Texas (AP)  A school 
program that brought local clergy to 
counsel students about morality and civic 
virtues was ruled unconstitutional by a 
federal appeals panel.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, voting 2-1 on 
Friday to overturn a 1996 federal dis
trict court ruling, sided with seven stu
dents and parents who argued the Beau
mont Independent School District pro
gram violated the Constitutional sepa
ration of church and state.
In the Clergy in the Schools pro
gram, which began in 1996, local reli
gious leaders were invited to counsel 
elementary and secondary students at 
the schools during school hours.
The district said the program let stu
dents discuss morality and civic vir
tues, helped increase school safety, and 
gave a local group an interest in the 
schools. The clergy were not to discuss 
religion, sex, or abortion and were not 
to pray with students.
[The school districts] creation of a 
special program that recruits only cler
gymen to render volunteer counseling 
makes a clear statement that it favors 
religion over nonreligion, the panel ruled.
The judges said the clergy selected 
were disproportionately Protestants. 
Parents were not notified or asked to 
give consent, though students could de
cline to participate.
The appeals court panel sent the case 
back to the federal district court to issue 
any orders necessary to prohibit the dis
trict from continuing with the program.
Company recalls 
soapy Slim-Fast
WASHINGTON (AP)  A batch of 
ready-to-drink diet shakes are being re
called by Slim Fast Foods because some 
of the cans may be filled with a diluted 
cleaning solution.
About 192,000 cans of Ultra Slim Fasts 
creamy milk-chocolate-flavored shakes 
are being pulled off the shelves, said Dr. 
Harry Greene, medical director of the 
West Palm Beach, Fla., company. The 
cans were sold individually.
The company believes only a few cans 
were filled with the cleaning liquid, a 
diluted solution used to clear the filling 
machines in between batches. Some of 
the liquid was accidentally canned and 
packaged with a group of milkshakes.
The recall was prompted by a com
plaint in Utah, where a customer re
ported buying a can filled with water. 
Another customer from the same store 
called a week later with the same com
plaint. The second customer was seen by 
a doctor after complaining about tin
gling in her mouth. Greene, who spoke 
with that doctor, said there was no ma
jor injury.
An FDA official said there isnt any
immediate health hazard from the prod
ucts being recalled.
The cans being pulled off the shelves 
come from batch No. ETMC9053B02. In 
addition to Utah, they were distributed 
to stores in Arizona, California, Colo
rado, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Or
egon, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
The product itself [from that batch] is 
perfectly OK, but to ensure that nobody 
else gets a can full of water, were recall
ing it from those areas, Greene said.
Counsel may turn 
investigation over
WASHINGTON (AP)Kenneth Starr 
is raising the possibility he might turn 
over parts of his criminal investigation 
of the Clintons to the Justice Depart
ment when the independent counsel law 
expires June 30.
If the law is not renewed, an indepen
dent counsel is required to make a de
termination as to whether his continua
tion with matters in his jurisdiction is 
required, Starr said in an interview 
Friday with The Associated Press.
Starr said he would follow the law and 
consult with the Justice Department 
before deciding.
Rejecting a suggestion he is readying 
an exit strategy, Starr said his office will 
continue to function, though he declined 
to say how long he plans to stay on the job.
At least for now, Congress seems un
likely to reauthorize the post-Watergate 
statute. But a clause in the law says 
existing counsels are to stay on the job 
until their investigation is complete.
Starr refused to speculate about what 
parts of his investigation might be turned 
over to the Justice Department, with 
which Starr said relations have become 
especially difficult in the past year.
In the Monica Lewinsky investiga
tion, the department represented the 
Secret Service in the court battle toikeep 
uniformed officers and agents from tes
tifying in Starrs investigation. Starr 
won the fight.
The department has advised Starr it 
intends to investigate his handling of 
the Lewinsky affair.
Starr said he has enjoyed the unfail
ing support of the director of the FBI. 
Louis Freeh has been terrific. Asked 
whether he would apply a similar as
sessment to Attorney General Janet 
Reno, Starr declined comment.

NEW DELHI, India (AP)  
Indias Hindu nationalist govern
ment resigned Saturday after los
ing a confidence vote by a single 
ballot, a margin that signaled con
tinued political turmoil as Italianborn Sonia Gandhi prepared to try 
to form the next government.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee gave his resignation to 
President K.R. Narayanan but 
agreed to stay on as caretaker un
til a new government was formed.
I accept the house verdict 
with all humility, said a som
ber Vajpayee.
The 270-269 vote ended the 13- 
month administration of the Hindu 
nationalist government, which 
unveiled Indias nuclear weapons
capability to the world, prompting 
rival Pakistan to follow suit.
The main opposition Congress 
Party, which governed India for 
45 of its 51 years as an indepen
dent nation, authorized Gandhi 
to decide on the shape of a fu
ture government.
Gandhi is the widow of Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi and 
daughter-in-law of Prime Minis
ter Indira Gandhi, both of whom 
were assassinated. Indiras fa
ther was Indias first prime min
ister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Congress has said Gandhi, a 
Roman Catholic, would be its 
prime minister if it formed a gov
ernment. But her birth in Italy 
and the fact that she delayed tak
ing Indian citizenship for many 
years after her marriage to Rajiv 
Gandhi has come under criticism 
by her political rivals.
Gandhi has focused on rebuild
ing the Congress Party since she 
emerged from seclusion early this 
year to campaign in national elec
tions and has made few policy 
statements. She was later named 
president of the party.
The party will wait for the presi
dent to invite the group to form 
a government rather than claim 
power, spokesman Aijun Singh 
said. The Congress Party is the second-largest group in Parliament, 
and the president was 
expected to call on it to form a 
new government.
The deep divide in Indias poli
tics made it uncertain Gandhi 
could put together a stable gov
ernment. Some 45 parties and 
independents occupy seats in 
the 545-member lower house 
of parliament.
If Congress fails to form a gov
ernment, elections would be called, 
four years ahead of schedule.
India has had two elections and 
five governments since 1996. The 
most durable was Vajpayees, 
which lasted 13 months. The 
shortest-lived government was 
also under Vajpayee, who has now 
been forced to resign in 1996 af
ter 13 days in office.
Im feeling free. I dont rule 
out the prospect of early elec

tions, Vajpayee said after ten
dering his resignation.
In Islamabad, Pakistans For
eign Ministry said it remained 
committed to negotiations with 
India regardless of who is in power.
Since a bus route opened be
tween the two rivals in February, 
Vajpayee had begun to build a 
rapport with his Pakistani coun
terpart Nawaz Sharif. Vajpayees 
departure will almost certainly 
be a setback.
The collapse of Vajpayees gov
ernment was precipitated by the 
second-largest party in the 
coalitions defection, which had 
more to do with regional politics 
in southern India than on issues 
of national policy.
The final vote still came as a 
surprise  even after three days 
of debate.
The vote was delayed more than 
an hour while the house debated 
whether a Congress Party mem
ber was eligible to vote after ac
cepting the position as head of a 
state government. The speaker 
ruled he could vote, and it proved 
decisive. Had he not, the speaker 
would have cast the tie-breaking 
vote and the government would 
have survived.
Indias stock market dropped 
seven percent on fears that 
Vajpayees investor-friendly 
budget would be shelved and 
foreign investors would shy 
away from an unstable country.

50 YEARS AGO, April 10,1949
 A new device that produced 
radar sandwiches was unveiled 
at Skibo dining hall.
A former director of food services 
for the Army Air Corps developed 
the device. It used neutrons, 
deutrons, and electrons to heatcellophane-wrapped sandwiches in five 
seconds. The device was installed 
in Skibo to cook the sandwiches and 
hot pies for students.
25 YEARS AGO, April 16,1974
 Planners for Spring Carnival 
added a new event called the 
Water Balloon Battle and 
Gazortching Contest to the 
schedule of activities.
The water balloon battle fea
tured teams squaring off 30 feet 
from each other with the goal of 
getting the other team as wet as 
possible in five minutes.
The Gazortching contest re
quired participants to gazortch a 
water-filled balloon 60 yards. The 
winner was whoever could gazortch 
the balloon the most accurately.
10 YEARS AGO, April 25,1989
 Pennsylvania State Police 
raided three University of Pitts
burgh fraternities and cited 109 
students for underaged drinking.
If convicted, people faced fines 
of up to $300. The raid contrasted 
with a similar action taken by 
police against CMU fraternities 
a year earlier when no arrests 
were made.
In the Pitt raid, more than 30 
half-barrels of beer were confis
cated. When officers arrived at 
the fraternities, exits were 
blocked off, and people over 21 
were allowed to leave. Those re
maining were cited.
The Pitt News reported that 
there had been rumors that raids 
might take place, and that at 
least one fraternity canceled its 
party because of the rumors.
After the weekend raids rumors 
persisted. One students parents 
were purportedly preparing to sue 
the police because of the raid.
A civilian advisor to the State 
Bureau of Liquor Control Enforce
ment said that he was not aware 
of any leaks before the raids.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 18, 
1994  Student Senate elections 
had a turnout of 12.3 
percent, the highest in a fewyear period.
Students also defeated a pro
posal for a plus/minus grading 
system by a margin of 615 -121. A 
similar measure was also voted 
on to apply the plus/minus sys
tem to freshman only, but was 
similarly defeated.
The elections, brought out 
nearly 20 percent of the under
graduate student body, but fewer 
graduate students.
ONE YEAR AGO, April 20, 
1998Kristen Buehler, a chemi
cal engineering doctoral student, 
caused a waste chemical explo
sion when she mixed two bottles 
under a fume hood.
The accident, which occured in 
Doherty Hall 1201, did not result 
in any injuries to Buehler or oth
ers in the lab at the time.
The problem occured because, 
while both bottles were labeled 
as inorganic, one of them actu
ally contained an organic solvent.

military might. They have also said
- that their fight is not against the Iraqi 
. people.
Pamphlets that were distributed at 
the protest indicated that in 1995, the 
U.N. Food and Agriculture program re
ported that more than a million Iraqis 
; had died due to the sanctions, 567,000 of 
; them children. Six thousand Iraqi in
fants die every month from hunger and 
disease, according to that report. In ad
dition, they said surgeries are performed 
without anesthesia; X-rays and phos
phates are banned from entering the 
country; and there are only two working 
ambulances in the city of Baghdad. The 
sanctions, according to the pamphlets, 
are finishing the destruction the 1991 
bombing began.
Thefun part is that we cant get the 
U.N. to go with our bombing campaigns 
anymore. Weve given up any sort of 
justification in the international 
communitiy, said Schnurer.
The best thing that we can do is 
raise a peaceful protest against all of 
this and hope that things will change. 
Weve seen the end to the most un
imaginable injustices as our own past 
has told us. Social change might be 
slow but it does happen.
For me the problem is individuals 
who lack compassion at a fundamental 
level. But people have been very sup
portive, said Schnurer, Just making 
people aware will help.
Another concern for the protestors 
was CMUs ties with the U.S. military 
and defense.
On December 28,1984, CMU received 
an initial $103 million contract to. do 
software engineering for the Depart
ment of Defense. In 1990, CMUs School 
of Computer Science had been develop
ing a computer program entitled Com
mand Action Team (CAT), an artificial 
intelligence system designed to assess 
potential threats against a carrier group 
as well as recommend possible action. 
This system was employed on several 
battleships positioned in the Persian 
Gulf. CAT was sponsored by the De
fense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) and monitored by the 
Space and Naval Warfare Systems Com
mand. In 1991, the DARPA-sponsored 
research that CMU scientists were enUvg1wsv 2mngut 1etcgtt Gg2nt9dIed
in was used by the military to 
create offensive weapons.
Eirene said that according to the Sep
tember 1991 issue of Z magazine, the 
Youth and Student Coalition Against 
Militarism showed CMU to be sixth 
among universities in getting dollar 
volume of military contracts, with 
an average of approximately $49.5 
million per year. CMUs Software 
Engineering Institute had a military 
contract worth $156,350,120 with the 
Department of Defense between 1989 
and 1994.
You have to [get] money somehow, 
and I guess the easiest way for CMU is 
to kill people who are a different race 
than they are, and I think that it is a 
reasonable justification. University of 
Pittsburgh does it too. All modern uni
versities need to [get] money somehow, 
and it seems only reasonable that we 
sell our weapons to the highest bidder, 
said Schnurer.
I think that any academic commu
nity that calls itself a place of higher 
education and then obtains a lot of its 
research and funding from the military 
industrial complex for developing 
weapon systems is on the verge of spiri
tual bankruptcy. I think that we should 
be putting money, time, and research 
into the arts and the environment in
stead of trying to find new and more 
exotic ways of destroying each other, 
said Eirene.
We are not against the people of CMU. 
We are just against the injustice that 
drives this kind of research, said Eirene.
Schnurer said that he feels students 
should question issues such as these 
more frequently.
People should make themselves 
aware, said Schnurer. They might 
think that we are lying, but were confi
dent that if people do bother to do the 
research, they will find some amazingly 
disturbing discoveries.

Honduras, Nicargua, 
and Guatemela in the 
aftermath of a hurri

Castaldo, that drive 
collected about 3,000 
different items, which 
were also donated to 
local shelters.
Fooksman said that 
he would like to try to 
further discuss the Kosovo is

more discussion on campus.... 
Theres not enough advertis

really detached here. Apathy 
builds when youre detached. 
I think on campus people 
are so focused on their studies 
they arent aware of whats

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University19 April 1999Email poll serves to gather student input
Last week, Paramount Pictures 
sent a request to the CMU admin
istration to allow for one more day 
of shooting of the Wonder Boys film 
in exchange for an additional 
$40,000 compensation. Before mak
ing a final decision, the adminis
tration asked Student Senate to 
get a sense of the student bodys 
feelings on the issue. Faced with 
the familiar problem of getting a 
response from the entire student 
body, Student Senate employed a 
new survey technique that worked 
much better than methods tried 
previously. The administrations 
asking for student input before 
making such decisions and Senates 
using email to this end are both 
improvements to the link between 
students and administrators. Both 
the administration and Senate 
should employ these practices when 
future decisions call for them.
Rather than set up a desk outside 
Doherty Hall as in the past, Stu
dent Senate sent email to every 
student on campus asking foi a 
response on the issue. A total of 
2652 students replied with simple 
yes or no votes, and many others 
responded with conditional votes 
or other suggestions on how the 
issue could be handled. Contrasted 
with the last attempt at gathering 
mass student opinion  the stu
dent referendum on the proposed 
PAT deal, to which only 1298 people 
responded  this turnout is un
precedented. The number also eas
ily surpasses the turnout for the 
1999 Student Government elec
tions, which garnered a mere 826 
total votes.
The Wonder Boys referendum 
represents a positive trend that the 
administration should continue  
getting student opinions before 
making a decision that affects the 
entire student body. The adminis
tration has traditionally made such 
decisions with minimal student 
input, and student concerns were 
addressed only after the changes 
had been put into effect. Recent 
decisions, such as the modifications 
to online registration and the lack 
of a keynote speaker at this years 
graduation, are prime examples of 
situations in which student input 
was not sufficiently considered.
In both of these cases, students 
expressed unhappiness that they 
werent consulted, causing tension 
between the student body and the 
administration.  Such situations 
could be avoided if the administra
tion uses the Wonder Boys referen
dum as a model. By getting student 
responses before the decision is 
made, the administration can make 
a decision that satisfies more of the 
student population. Students 
should have their opinions seri
ously considered when the admin
istration makes such important 
decisions  and to do so, those 
opinions must be heard.

During Carnival weekend, we all 
hope for beautiful weather. But 
this year, as in many other years, 
Carnival was overshadowed by rain 
all weekend. With so many outdoor 
events planned during Carnival 
weekend, organizers must make 
contingency plans for bad weather. 
This year, some organizers had 
backup plans that allowed events 
to go off without a hitch. Poor plan
ning on the part of others, however, 
caused events to suffer.
Buggya definitive CMU tradi
tion was one Carnival event that 
suffered. The races became disor
ganized because oflast-minute time 
changes, and safety conditions for 
the participants were questionable. 
Because of wet conditions, some 
Friday trial runs were rained out, 
and the Saturday races were called 
off altogether at 11 amthree and 
a half hours after they were sched
uled to start. The cancellationforced 
the entire mens competition to take 
place on Sunday. The decision to 
run races on Sunday at all is ques
tionable, as Sunday mornings con
ditions were no better  if not 
worse  than Fridays. Time 
changes were also confusing for 
spectators and officials, especially 
as the changes were not well-pub
licized by organizers.
Moving faster through Fridays 
heats might have prevented the 
scheduling change. To help ensure 
that all of the mens heats would 
take place on Sunday, Sweepstakes 
shortened the time interval be
tween the starts of heats. Having 
shortened the heats on Friday 
knowing that conditions were bad 
might have eliminated the need for 
Sunday races.

Buggy planners also did not post 
a schedule for Sundays make-up 
event, making the experience diffi
cult for officials and spectators. In 
addition, other organizations, such 
as Alpha Phi Omega and WRCT, 
had difficulty planningfor Sundays 
event. As a result, the A Phi O 
scoreboard was not out on Hill 1, 
and the customary radio broadcast 
did not take place.
Other organizers created better 
Carnival rain plans in advance. 
Because of the rain, AB Tech had to 
prevent safety problems with elec
trical equipment. Last Friday sev
eral electrical problems on Midway 
could have prevented it from open
ing as scheduled, but the problems 
were fixed before people arrived, 
and Midways rides and lights func
tioned as planned.
AB Tech also had a solid contin
gency plan for rain during Soul 
Coughings scheduled appearance. 
The rain location was well-publicized, alleviating potential confu
sion for spectators. Because of ap
propriate planning, the concert 
went smoothlythough the acous
tics suffered, the event was still 
enjoyed by those who attended.
Overall, Carnival Committee 
handled the weather as well as can 
be expected. Attendance and en
thusiasm suffered due to the condi
tions, but the Committee took ap
propriate steps to ensure that safety 
and security was not compromised.
For the second time in three years, 
inclement weather has forced Car
nival organizers to turn to contin
gency plans, with varying amounts 
of success. In the future, all orga
nizers should establish clear guide
lines for what to do when it rains.
As student outrage turns again to apa
thy over the University of Pittsburghs 
decision to move the Panther football 
team to the new downtown football sta
dium, Id like to take my 
parting shots at an ad
ministration that used 
every possible means to 
exclude, subvert, and 
ignore the input and 
wishes of the student 
body on such an impor
tant matter.
On March 19, Pitt 
chancellor Mark Nordenberg announced offi
cially that the board of 
trustees had voted unani
mously to demolish the 
75-year-old Pitt Stadium 
in favor of a new convoca
tion center, student hous
ing, and green space. This 
finalized a long-rumored 
move that will end one of 
the oldest and most tra
dition-rich programs in 
college football.
While many students 
were outraged that the 
university would even 
consider such a move, 
which would undoubtedly kill much of 
the student enthusiasm for the program, 
more appalling is the fact that the school 
totally excluded all student input and 
went against everything the students 
wanted. I believe that, by following this 
course of action, the university is not 
only neglecting its students but doom
ing the entire Pitt football program.
I dont want to argue that there is 
absolutely no reason to make the move. 
The university claims that relocating 
football games to Three Rivers will help 
with recruiting, alumni relations, and, 
perhaps most importantly, the financial 
bottom line. Top football teams in the 
nation have spent two, five, and some
times even 10 times what Pitt has on 
recruiting and facilities improvement 
over the last decade. These teams also 
take in two to five times more revenue
than the struggling Panther team. The 
university asserts that the revenue from 
the new stadiums luxury boxes alone 
may surpass the total ticket sales rev
enue from the old stadium. Basically, 
they ask, How can you pass up the 
opportunity to move into a brand-new 
$233 million stadium?
I ask, How can you ignore the wishes 
of people who you are supposed to serve? 
The last thing that the Panthers need to
slow months, and without that busi- 
ness, some merchants fear that they 
may even have to close their doors. In a 
time when the trustees claim that they T 
are committed to improving the Oakland area, their actions have shown that  
their agenda lies elsewhere.
The University of Pittsburgh has ig' 
nored its commitment and responsibil-1 
ity to the Oakland area and, more im
portantly, to the students. From ando now is to alienate fans. The team has 
been consistently near the bottom for 
nearly a decade, and now theyre going 
to destroy a symbol of past greatness  
the home of six national championships, 
countless NFL athletes, and some of the 
best players ever to play the game.
In an attempt to increase alumni at
tendance (many alumni claim that Oak
land is too inconvenient), the team is 
going to estrange their future alumni, 
the students. By holding Panther games 
a bus ride away instead of within walk
ing distance, the team is discouraging 
student participation and enthusiasm 
in the team, which, in the long run, will 
destroy all interest in Panther football.
The team is also ignoring its commit
ment to the Oakland community. Local 
restaurants and bars rely on the brisk 
game day business to make up for the
<diwt Fn&nssewmSAdmvds lmv 71evnm e 
nouncing the decision to raze while stu' 
dents were on spring break to allegedly 1 
convincing Pitt alum Tony Dorsett, one n 
of the NFLs all-time greatest running 5 
backs, not to speak at a student-orgaJ 
nized Save Our Stadium rally, the': 
administration has done everything - 
in its power to neglect and even ' 
subvert student participation in a 
decision that will affect to a large 
part how the university is seen by - 
the nation. '
This decision will destroy Pitt pride. 
The last thing the Pitt football program 
needs now is to be broadcast on national 
television in a brand-new, state-of-theart, empty stadium.

Fools be you all! For verily, I say, the 
world is flat! Flat like a pancake! And thou 
ignorest my warnings at thine own peril!
The dogma of the day sings the seductive 
song of a round world, a world round like an 
orange. But I say never, for tis a massive 
coverup by the leaders of our Republic and 
the heathen nations of the Far East! The 
world is flat, a truth plain as an old maids 
face to even the youngest whelp  for but 
what has one to do but gaze out at the 
horizon? A flat horizon, is it not? I see no 
curvature, and neither would any rightminded man, but the starry-eyed geolo
gists and mentally infirm astrologers have 
all but utterly fooled the ignorant masses 
into thinking the world round!
And why? How could a farce as ludicrous 
as this be perpetrated? Why, tis is a con
spiracy  one stretching into the highmost 
levels of our Republics government, our 
leaders bribed by the Freemasons and their 
Zionist bankers. For they darest not reveal 
the true nature of things, lest there be 
widespread panic and anarchy! Yearly, 
scores of ships set sail to the ends of the 
earth, to tumble from the edge and never be 
seen again. The government, conspiring 
with the newspaper men, fabricate stories 
of foreign wars to obscure these disappear
ances. But lo, the truth is far worse. For
these ships and the poor men aboard 
are sent to meet their maker knowingly, 
to feed the demons which reside under 
the Earth!
Yes, that is the truth. Two centuries 
ago, when the history books say the 
New World was discovered, explorers 
found something far more horrifying. 
Underneath the earth, in a cavernous 
void, lay a vast world of demons, which 
had long been feeding off the occasional 
sailors and marine life which dropped 
into their jaws. But as. the explorers
found, the beasts had grown numerous, 
and there was a movement to invade the 
upper world of Man. Our leaders then 
decided in secret council that the way to 
hold the loathsome demons at bay was to 
sate their appetites.
And sate them we did. For in the socalled expansion to the New World, many 
ships were lost. They were said to be lost at 
sea  and they were, in a way. But they 
were deliberately sent to the edge of the 
world, loaded bursting with human cargo, 
to feed the slavering jaws of the demons
below. And the practice continueth to the 
present day, with shiploads sent to die so 
that the beasts might remain below.
But, I say, we cannot allow such trick
ery! We uphold this farce only to our ulti
mate peril! One day soon, the beasts shall 
grow numerous again, and the ships we 
send to placate them shall not suffice, and 
they shall climb over the edge and invade 
our lands, ravaging our people and over
running us like so many cattle! Idly sit by 
we cannot, for we merely turn a blind eye 
to the greater danger!
Man has conquered the natural world, 
tamed every animal, subjugated the land 
to his own uses. This last frontier remains; 
we must attack now while we can! Before 
the demons which cavort below our land 
grow restless, while they are still pla
cated, we must launch an attack and wipe 
them out! The leaders of our republics 
must be made to realize that they cannot 
fool the populace with their transparent 
lies for much longer  they must know 
that we will fight and destroy! Verily, it is 
not the way of man to hide cowering in fear 
while the beast legions lay siege outside 
the cave!
Make your voice heard; say that you will 
not accept this silly notion of a ball-like 
world, for our dear children will pay for 
our misdeeds and indolence. Shall we stand 
idly by, knowing that the future will be 
one of a demon plague and invasion? Say 
I, no! Attack the vile demons that repose 
beneath our earth! For the children!

EARTH, from page 4
papers stopped publishing statistics about 
how much garbage had been thrown away 
in the past year when it could have been 
recycled. Since it wasnt in our faces any
more, we kind of forgot about it. After all, 
separating your trash is 
kind of gross, right? And 
its kind of a pain to drive to 
the recycling center, right?
And were only one family, 
so it wont make that much 
difference, right? So we 
salved our consciences and 
went on our merry ways.
You can see the evidence right here on 
campus. We have all these lovely blue recy
cling bins around, but who actually puts 
cans in them? The next trash can is almost 
20 feet away, so people just throw their 
trash in the recycling bins. The CPS people
dont want to pick through recyclable 
pop cans and juice bottles to pull out the 
non-recyclable dirty napkins and food 
leftovers, so it all just goes in the trash. 
One thoughtless person can thus under
mine 30 people who made the effort to
Is it really worth saving a few 
extra hours of work to trash 
the planet so carelessly?
recycle their cans or bottles.
Then theres the food service in the 
University Center. Granted, itd be 
nearly impossible for the various ven
dors to use reusable plates, because 
theres no way to ensure that people 
would return them, and no way to wash
them if they were returned. But what 
about the Schatz Dining Room? Last year, 
they used real dishes, cups, and silver
ware. This year, when they switched the 
meal-plan breakfast from Highlander 
to Schatz, they also switched from real, 
dishes to Styrofoam. Not even paper, 
but Styrofoam. That nasty, CFC-causing 
substance that takes about 70 gazillion 
years to break down in the garbage  
the bane of all environmentalists. And 
this when they actually. already have 
the dishes, plus the place to wash them! 
I realize that theres a lot more traffic 
through Schatz than there used to be, 
but come on. How many tons of Styro
foam trash are we throwing away every 
week? Is it really worth saving a few 
extra hours of work to trash the planet 
so carelessly?
I know we here at CMU cherish our
reputation for apathy, but lets break the 
mold this week. Surprise the students 
in Earth, the campus environmentalist 
organization, by actually showing up to 
go clean up Schenley Park this Saturday. 
Celebrate Earth Day on the Cut 
with them this Thursday. Or go find 
something else to do thats good for the 
planet. There are groups all over 
Pittsburgh that are sponsoring events 
in honor of Earth Day. Find out about 
one and go do it. Try walking the extra 
10 steps to throw your trash away in 
the trash cans instead of the recycling 
bins. And for Petes sake, quit 
driving those gas-guzzling sportutility vehicles.

ou know the old trick where youre supposed to visual
ize people in their underwear when you have to speak 
in public? Well, heres a better one. Ready? Imagine every
one with a bald chimpanzee on their head. You know, a big, 
shaved chimpanzee. With a banana. Now, if youve ever 
seen a shaved chimpanzee, youll know: thats comedy. 
Thats solid gold, right there. Im my own hilarious comedy 
duo. I dont need your underwear.

Curious George is Curious About Aspect Ratios
by: James KenneyUNITED MI Ta1 H BuNKr
I realized today that the best children's book to 
come to life would be Curious George, because 
I have a friend named George arid he is curious.
In most fictional scenarios in which something 
inanimate becomes animate evil is usually 
lurking close by. Now it wasn't my idea to bring 
Curious George to life, but what's been done can't 
be undone, except for putting salt in water and 
then boiling the water and taking the salt back.
Currently Curious George is burning and 
pillaging the New York City skyline. When George 
first came to life, he was a cute friendly monkey 
getting into innocent mischief, much like his 
fictional misadventures children love so much. 
Then he came across his friend, the Man in 
the Yellow Hat, also known as Pedro to C.G. 
fan club members. Send 5 U.P.C. symbols and 
$1.95 shipping and handling to me to join.

Contained within his fictional story land, Pedro

magician Javier. In our world Pedro is a radical 
dictator, ruthless, and abusive. He violently 
beat George, until George had had enough. 
George grew to a size of 1,000 feet tall and 
went on to destroy the N.Y.C. Skyline. The 
moral of this story is... email: jpkenney
There is no moral to the story but there is a 
morale. George decided Pedro was an evil too 
evil to be ignored. Although George was 1,000 
feet tall, he was no match for Pedro's hot dog 
helicopter. George rallied the public, raising 
morale with his zany anecdotes. He realized 
that when he combine the powers of 3 peasants, 
they could work as an effective wise magician. 
Pedro was banished. Much rejoicing.

Play Ball
by Matt Brun
Despite the growing list of injured 
superstars around the league, two things 
have remained constant in the 1999 
major league baseball season: the Yan
kees and Indians are damn good teams, 
and the offensive explosion begun over 
the past few years is continuing.
It used to be that a one-run game 
referred to a 3-2 or maybe 5-4 game 
where each team would scratch and 
claw to manufacture runs any way they 
could. Late-inning drama meant wait
ing to see if a runner would steal or even 
the drama of a suicide squeeze. Nowa
days, a one-run game more likely means 
a 9-8 or 15-14 game in which the loser 
was the team that didnt hit as many 
home runs. Whatever the reason  
pitching spread too thin by expansion, 
bigger, stronger hitters, juiced balls  
baseball scores continue to read more 
and more like football scores day in and 
day out. Theoretically, there should be 
an upper limit on how many runs a team 
can score in a single game, so we 
shouldnt ever see a baseball box score 
that resembles a basketball game 
though the NBA seems to be trying 
hard to come down to that level  
but if things dont change, who 
knows how high scores could climb?
To the average fan, this most 
likely isnt a problem. Home runs 
are spectacular plays that gener
ate interest, albeit only for a few 
moments. Casual observers arent 
interested in a good pitchers duel 
anymore, they want to see the big 
hitters hit. True fans of the game, 
however, have seen the overall qual
ity of the game decrease as scores 
continue to inflate.
The talent is still there, but its 
being focused differently than in 
the past. Rather than field lineups 
that are solid from top to bottom 
and can string hits together to get
runs, teams have a couple of guys, 
who can get on base and one or two 
power hitters to bring them in. 
Speed is no longer the most impor
tant attribute in the top of the 
lineup, since runners expect to trot 
home after a homer rather than 
sprint all the way from first on a 
deep single.
The unimportance of speed in the ; 
lineup is also apparent in the role ; 
stealing has taken in todays game. = 
Managers used to send the sign for j 
a steal only in crucial situations J 
where the one run was more valu\ 
able than the risk of losing a basefj 
runner. Now, almost anyone who ! 
gets on base  certainly anyone 1 
with the slightest hint of speed  i

Last week, the CMU track and

ups for the upcoming UAA 
championships. Despite the in
clement weather, the teams got 
in two meets against some tough 
non-conference opponents to 
conclude their warm-ups for the
Fans who came out to Gesling 
Stadium on Wednesday were 
treated to the last traces of good 
weather before the weekend-long 
rains hit town as the Tartans 
held their last home meet of the 
season. Running against three 
tough non-conference teams in 
Grove City College, Allegheny 
College, and Bethany College, the 
Tartans turned in a solid but 
unremarkable performance.
UvdcwO Awvb9d--SAdmvds .ynvn Uvd--
The Tartan women put on a less-than-spectacular performance last Wednesday, finishing 
Second to winner Allegheny College. Next up is the UAA championship meet.
Despite only winning one event 
between the mens and womens 
sides, CMU placed runners in 
almost every event, and racked 
up enough points to remain com
petitive. In the end, there just 
werent enough secondand thirdplaces to make up the difference, 
as Allegheny left with both the 
mens and womens crowns. The 
Tartan women finished a medio
cre second, edging out Grove City 
and Bethany 
but not provid
ing much of a 
challenge to Al
legheny. The 
men didnt fare 
quite as well, 
dropping be
hind Grove 
City to finish in 
third place.
Team head 
coach Dario 
Donatelli was 
satisfied, 
though not par
ticularly im
pressed, with 
the teams performances. 
We ran pretty 
well and got
some good perfor
mances, he said.
For the women, the 
days best perfor
mance came from 
senior art major Mar
garet Powers. Run
ning in the 1500m,
Powers qualified 
for the NCAA Divi
sion III champion
ships with a time of 
4:39.9. Even that 
effort wasnt enough 
on Wednesday, how
ever, as Powers 
finished the race 
second to a runner 
from Allegheny.
The lone CMU 
winner of the day 
was first-year pole 
vaulter Russell Ball.
Ball cleared a height 
of 13 feet-six inches to edge out 
the competition. [Ballls been 
vaulting very consistently at that 
level all season, Donatelli said. 
Were expecting him to do very 
well at UAAs.
To Donatelli, the key to the 
meet was not the teams finish
ing places, but the constant im
provement the, team has shown
Last Wednesdays meet was a rough ride for the Tartan men, who finished third out, 
of the four teams, but the upcoming UAA championships will be tougher still.
over the past few meets. Our 
performances have been getting 
better all season, he said. Im 
pretty happy with the way weve 
been improving.
On Saturday, the teams made 
the not-so-distant trip down Fifth 
Avenue to compete in the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh Invitational 
Relays. Despite being the teams
last competition before the UAA i 
championships at the University i 
of Rochester next week, the naj 
tureofthe meet prevented it from j 
being a good tune-up. Since it* 
was a relay meet, we had to put 
kids in different events they dont 
usually run so we could field^ 
teams, Donatelli said.

The Basketball Beat
by Pete Patterson
In this NBA season full of surprises 
and the unexpected, the greatest upset 
has come in the standings. At one point 
arly in the past week, before two con
secutive losses by the Blazers, Portland 
and Orlando had the best records in 
ijheir respective conferences.
 The Blazers are hoping to end the 
(Jecade as they began it, in the NBA 
ilnals. The Portland teams from 1990 
and 1992 both made it to the penultimate 
series, only to fall short to first the Pis
tons and then the Bulls. Those teams 
vere not exactly Cinderellas, as they 
^vere led by star guard Clyde Drexler 
4nd a solid supporting cast of Terry 
porter, Jerome Kersey, Cliff Robinson,
and the big man, Kevin Duckworth.
This years edition of the Blazers, how
ever, was not so highly regarded coming 
into the season. Sure, theyre a solid 
team, but how could they compete with 
the elite in the Western Conference? 
The Lakers were expected to finally come 
of age and play up to their immense 
potential. The Rockets, winners of the 
championship the last time Michael Jor
dan retired, had three players on their 
roster among the top 50 in league his
tory in Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, 
and Hakeem Olajuwon. The Spurs pos
sessed the lethal front court of David 
Robinson and Tim Duncan, along with 
the return of a healthy Sean Elliot to 
provide scoring punch. The Sonics also 
figured to challenge for the top spot, 
with arguably the best player in the 
game now that Jordan is gone, Gary 
Payton. And, of course, the Utah Jazz 
would be in the mix with the return of a 
nucleus seemingly around since the time 
todays young stars were in diapers.
The Blazers? Two things come to mind 
when thinking about the team. Trouble 
with the law, led by the untamable Isaiah 
Rider, and the decision in 1983 to choose
Sam Bowie with the second pick in the 
draft rather than a certain skinny off 
guard from North Carolina named 
Michael Jordan. Lost amongst this was 
the fact that the team had an NBA 
record run of 16 consecutive seasons 
making the playoffs, and had been 
steadily amassing a stable of high-qu 
ality players. The team has no true su
perstars, but may have the greatest 
collection of talent in the game. Ten 
players average at least 12 minutes a 
game, and they are the anti-Lakers,  
with everyone willing to make a sacri
fice for the good of the team. Rasheed 
Wallace graciously stepped out of the 
starting lineup to accommodate Brian 
Grant and has been performing admira
bly as the sixth man. Jimmy Jackson, a 
former franchise player with the Maver
icks, has taken a reduced role with no 
complaints. Showing that some things 
never change, though, the Blazers are 
behind only the Utah Jazz in the stand
ings, and Isaiah Rider has had several 
scrapes with the law.
The Orlando Magic are an even greater 
surprise in the Eastern Conference. With 
the retirement of MJ, the conference
was thought to be wide open, but the 
Magic were not expected to battle for 
the top spot. The Indiana Pacers were 
the trendy pick for the top, as they 
came close to unseating the Bulls last 
year and were one of the few teams 
who returned a cohesive unit after 
the lockout. The Miami Heat were 
expected to make a run at the title, 
along with Pat Rileys former team, 
the Knicks. The Magic were a 
team in disarray, with Anfernee 
Hardaway coming off two in
jury-plagued seasons, an aging 
Horace Grant and former backup 
Ike Austin down low, and never 
having fully recovered from the loss 
of Shaquille ONeal.
However, the team started off the 
season on fire, and has yet to look back. 
Hardaway has come back well from 
injury and run-ins with coach Chuck 
Daly to become a team leader. Nick 
Anderson has continued the solid play 
he showed the last couple of years, 
coming back from ah ugly stretch in 
the mid-90s. The spark plug of the 
team has been six-foot Darryl

Over the past century, our understand
ing of the fundamental laws'of physics 
has advanced tremendously. Scientists 
have drawn an elegant description of 
the elementary particles of physics and 
the forces acting among them. The 
principal remaining challenge is the 
incorporation of the gravitational force 
into this framework. The leading can
didate for achieving this goal is string 
theory. String theory unites all known 
forces and particles into a single, co

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  19 April 199911
CMU expects little at UAAs
TRACK, from page 9
The same dismal weather that put a 
damper on Carnival also wreaked havoc 
on the meet. A few running events and 
most of the field events, including shot 
put, pole vault, and high jump, were 
canceled due to rain. Actually, 
the weather may have been a mixed 
blessing, since we may be runningunder 
the same conditions in Rochester, 
Donatelli said.
CMU was one of a number of local 
schools who attended the meet, joining a 
scattering of bigger schools who domi
nated most of the competition. Pitt and 
Edinboro [University] gave some stiff 
competition in most of the events, 
Donatelli said.
For the most part, CMU had to settle 
for lower-ranked finishes, but the day 
was not without its stars. Powers led the 
women once again by winning the 3000m,
and senior industrial management ma
jor Jonathan Stein joined her on the list 
of NCAA qualifiers by winning the jav
elin with a distance of 187 feet.
As the UAA meet draws ever closer, 
expectations are not too high around the 
Tartan camps. Though they havent faced 
any UAA teams this season, the teams 
goals are just to be competitive. Were 
right in the middle of the pack, Donatelli 
said. We should get around fourth or 
fifth both in mens and womens.
The main obstacle to the Tartans 
chances is the lack of runners who can 
consistently rack up large numbers of 
points every meet. As a team, both the 
mens and womens squads are loaded 
with average talent that must often settle 
for fewer points by taking lower places 
in the standings. In the UAAs, you 
usually need five or six outstanding in
dividuals, and we just dont have that
many, Donatelli said.
The list of events where the Tartans 
should do well remains fairly short, but 
should be enough to make a decent show
ing. The men will rely heavily on the 
field events and steeplechase for points, 
while most of the production for the 
women will come from the distance run
ners. We may be able to pick up a few 
points from fifthor sixth-places in a lot 
of distance events, Donatelli said.
After last weeks meets, Donatelli feels 
that both teams are at the highest level 
they could hope for heading into the 
UAAs. Weve come a long way since 
indoors, but theres only so far you can 
go, he said. Even if the season were 
longer, we probably wouldnt make many 
more improvements.
The UAA championships will be 
held at the University of Rochester on 
April 23-25.
Surprises keep 
coming in NBA
BASKETBALL, from page 9
Armstrong, who comes off the bench 
and flies around the court, sending the 
team into a whole new gear. Bo Out
law, Derek Strong, Austin, and Grant 
have managed to hold the fort down 
low, and rookie Matt Harpring from 
Georgia Tech has given the team qual
ity minutes. With the conference fa
vorites struggling, the Magic have had 
a season-long hold on the top spot in 
the East.
Will the Blazers and the Magic be 
able to continue their success into the 
playoffs? Reason would seem to say 
no, as older and more playoff-tested 
teams often prevail in the rough-andtumble postseason. However, each of1 
these teams has proven the experts; 
wrong already this season, and would; 
love to continue to do so. The Blazers arej 
looking for their first title since the 1977| 
team led by everyones favorite an
nouncer, Bill Walton, and the Magic are 
looking to retain their status in the mid90s as one of the leagues elite, up-and 
coming teams.
Pete Patterson is a sophomore IDS 
major. As CMUs resident basketball 
guru, he is never surprised by events in 
the NBA season. Anyone who doubts his 
wisdom is doomed to an eternity of watch
ing the Los Angeles Clippers play.Baseball faces another crisis
BASEBALL, from page 9
goes for an extra base sometime during 
the next two at-bats. Defensively, teams 
are often perfectly willing to accede a 
base, and strong-armed catchers are rap
idly becoming an endangered species 
around the league. More and more, play
ers continue to make their way to the 
BigShow with their bats rather than 
their gloves.
Whether as a result of 
expansion or not, poor 
pitching is a major reason 
for the offensive explosion.
Its still true that good 
pitching will beat good hit
ting any day, but the prob
lem with the league today 
is that the good pitching is 
all on the same teams as 
the good hitting. This is a 
direct result of the grow
ing disparity between the 
big-market teams and 
their small-market victims
 er, competitors. While a 
single ace can steal a game 
for the small-market 
teams every five days, the 
team spends the other four 
getting clubbed into sub
mission. Then, when the 
aces contract expires, he 
splits for a contender, and 
another big-market team 
gets even richer.
The perfect example of 
this situation is the Phila
delphia Phillies Curt 
Schilling. The only true 
star on the Phillies ros
ter, Schilling is the kind of 
dominating ace that big-market teams, 
most notably Cleveland, drool over. 
Should the Phillies lose Schilling either 
in a last-second deal before the trading 
deadline, or as a free agent when his 
contract expires, one of the last bastions 
of hope for small-market teams will be
gone. The ownership in Philadelphia 
has been adamantly stating that 
Schilling will stay, but if they succumb 
and Schilling leaves for greener pas
tures, it may be the point of no return for 
baseballs path to disparity.
Clearly, something must be done soon 
to remedy this situation. The owners 
recognize this, but are currently power
less to do anything about it. The sim
plest solution would be to introduce a 
salary cap. The NFL has had a strict 
salary cap in place for years, and, though 
no one can understand all the rules it 
states, it has allowed every team in the 
league to go after big-name free agents 
to stay competitive. The much-publi
cized, yet ignored-by-the-fans lockout 
the NBA went through this year was 
largely a result of the owners insistence 
on a hard salary cap. Baseball will face 
a similar problem when the time comes 
to finally deal with the situation. The 
players association will not accept a sal
ary cap of any form, and with memories 
of the 1994 strike still relatively fresh in 
the fans minds, and certainly fresh in 
the owners minds, the 
owners will be hardpressed to implement 
one when the current 
collective bargaining 
agreement expires.
Until some kind of 
solutionis setup, con
ditions will only 
worsen. Contracts 
like Kevin Browns 
$105-million deal 
with the Dodgers 
willbecome the norm, 
and owners will 
have no choice but to 
raise ticket prices 
again and again until 
no one can afford to 
come to the games. 
The fans are power
less to do anything but 
keep paying, so the 
responsibility lies 
with the owners and 
players to stop this 
trend before it's too 
late. In other words, 
if some kind of com
promise isnt reached 
soon, the national 
: Blum/Tartan Art Staff pastime is headed for 
complete self-de-struction.
Matt Brun is a first-year ECE major. 
To date, he has not been affected by 
rising ticket prices, despite being a poor

PROM DATE
5:37 PM I wake up as the phone rings. I crawl out of my bed reaching for the phone. Who else could it be, but my significant other. 1 don't want to sound 
bitter about her 'cause I was not back then. But for Christ's sake, I am trying to get some sleep before prom night. As soon as I say hello, Sandy starts 
yelling at me for being late. WHAT? I had enough time. 1 calm her down and tell her that I will be there in about an hour. After hanging up the phone,
I lay back and go over tonight's plan, not knowing how much of it will go as anticipated. Take a shower. Put on my tux. My parents, especially my mom, will 
not let go of me without a couple of pictures. So I go and pick up Sandy's specially ordered corsage. It looks really nice; roses and orchids. Boy, I really liked 
her.
6:38 PM I pull over in front of her house. I get out of my car. The street was pretty quiet and empty. So I walk up to the door, 
ring the bell. Her dad opens the door with the most fake smile; one of those smiles that means "I want to 
kill you" I feel sick to my stomach. But I own the world as Sandy f
walks down the stairs. She is wearing this red velvet dress. She's shining. I am speechless. We take pic
tures; you know the routine. We go meet our friends at the restaurant.
9:43 PM We arrive at prom with 12 other couples. We go in and take two tables. Sit around and dance 
bit. It was a fairly good band. They even play "Lady in Red" upon my request. She loved it. I think.
12:45 AM She takes me out of the ballroom and tells me that she is in love with my best 
friend and that they have been seeing each other for a couple of weeks now. She does 
not wait for my response, and leaves.
12:51 AM My world has crushed on me. All the buildings built with my hand are 
collapsing. Everywhere is dark and gloomy. I can't see anything. I just lean on the 
wall and slide down to the floor. I am half-dead. I think that there's no other reason 
to live any more. After a couple of minutes. I just go inside to get my coat, and l see 
her dancing with my best buddy. Not so best I guess. I'm more sad than angry.
1:08 AM I turn on my car and head home. On the way I decide to take a long drive to 
the river and just watch the sun shine.
2:10 AM In one of the darkest neighborhoods on my way to the river, I run out of fuel. Great.
This is just what I need. I lock my doors and try to take a nap.
4:26 AM A baseball bat hits into my side window. Two guys are shouting and demanding me that I get out of the car. I'm scared.
But I do as they tell me. I'm out of fuel anyway. But they are smarter than me. They throw me out of the car and get in the car, 
and leave. I guess they had filled the tank before they woke me up. I watch them as they drive away with my car. Angry, sad, 
and frustrated. So I walk to the river.
5:14 AM I sit on one of the walls and watch the sunrise. Perfect timing. What a night! I lost precious things. Not a great prom 
date but a beautiful sunrise.
I finally got home that day. Did not feel sad or angry. I guess just lucky 
to be alive. How was your prom night?

In case you slept through Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday of Carni
val, you were still able to catch the 
mens Sweepstakes races, which 
were postponed until Sunday. And if
Before the fifth heat started, the 
organizers decided to postpone the 
remaining races to the next morn
ing. Unfortunately, there were peri
ods of rain Saturday morning as 
well. Several cars and trucks tried 
to dry the roads by continually dri
ving over them. Despite these

you happened to snooze through 
winter, the mens buggy races 
afforded an opportunity to take in 
some cold, windy air as well.
Last Friday, following all of the 
womens heats, four heats of mens 
buggy took place. The teams faced 
some problems, however. The wet 
roads caused some pushers to slip 
and fall. Slick conditions played a 
role in three disqualifications at the 
finish line when the Hill 5 pusher did 
not have the handle of the buggy as it 
crossed the finished line.

efforts, no races were held that day. 
All of the mens heats were to be 
held the following morning, weather 
permitting. Without having the ben
efit of two days for Sweepstakes, 
some format adjustments had to be 
made for Sunday.
We wanted to get all the mens 
times in. If possible, we wanted to 
have those four heats run again, 
said Debby Keller, senior biology 
major and Sweepstakes chair.
Even though there was an occa
sional rain delay, Sundays weather
allowed these heats to take place 
again once all of the remaining 
eight scheduled races were held. 
Instead of having the teams with 
the top ten finishes compete in 
another round, each team ran one 
heat. The fastest time of the day 
would result in a trophy. Coming 
into race day, many people knew 
who the top contenders were.
It should be a close race between 
Spirit and PiKA, said Joshua 
Wilke, a sophomore business 
administration major and a 
mechanic for the Pi Kappa 
Alpha (PiKA) buggy team, befor 
the races.
It was PiKA, the organization 
that has won the most Sweepstakes 
titles since the event was first held 
in 1921, who dominated the compe
tition in the mens races. Not only 
did PiKA A take first place with a 
time of 2:09.72, but their B and C 
teams took third and fifth place 
respectively as well.
We had some great competition 
that pushed us really hard this 
year, said Brian Hendrix, a junior 
mechanical engineering major and 
a mechanic for the PiKA buggy 
team. Everyone in our organization 
contributed greatly.
When PiKA A crossed the finish 
line time of 2:09.72, their celebra
tion did not last long. Spirit A was 
scheduled to go soon afterward. At 
the time of the race, most of PiKA 
had moved from their truck to the 
top of Frew Street to watch the fin
ish. There were loud cheers when 
Spirit crossed the line with a 
time of 2:10.99.
Spirit As time was good enough to 
take second place, but the team 
was somewhat disappointed 
with their performance.
Its been a tough year, especially 
this weekend, said Joshua Stieff, a 
senior mechanical engineering 
major and Spirit Buggy chair. The

weather played a serious effect on 
the morale of our team. Everyone 
expected to be done by Saturday.
One team that was very satisfied 
with their outcome was the Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC). Their A 
team finished fourth with a time 
of 2:18.50.
We are completely psyched and 
so happy. It feels great to be coming 
back, said Karen Werther, a junior 
business administration major and 
SDC Buggy chair. We have a young 
team, and well be coming back 
strong next year. The inclement 
weather caused a few problems on 
Sunday, nevertheless. There were 
three spin-outs this year, as well as a 
few disqualifications at the finish 
line. However, the event was not as 
dangerous as some people predicted.
Weve had a few more injuries 
this year than in previous years; but 
overall, it hasnt been that bad, 
said Marc Unangst, a member of 
the computer science department 
staff and CMU Emergency 
Medical Service.

A first-year student would 
think that the Carnival 
Awards ceremony would be a 
normal, boring presentation. 
However, the event, which 
was relocated to the Main 
Tent in the Morewood Lot, 
was anything but dull. The 
atmosphere before the cere
mony was more like the pre
lude to a rock concert  a 
couple hundered people 
milling about, music blaring 
from 10-foot high speakers, 
and a rose-colored light illu
minating the entire stage.
Its always loud and 
rowdy, said senior electrical 
and computer engineering 
major and Carnival Commit
tee Chair Margaret Wang, 
noting that the enclosed envi
ronment of the tent only 
amplified the noise. The PA 
contributed to it too  people 
were yelling and could 
not hear us talk, so they 
yelled even louder that they 
couldnt hear.
As the awards began, there 
was an outcry of disappoint
ment as the announcer stated 
that only the booth chair 
could receive the award. To 
start off, Kappa Kappa 
Gamma won the Environ
mental Award. As with every 
time an award for a sorority 
was announced, the presenta
tion was accompanied by
enough female yelling 
and screaming to rival a 
Hanson concert.
The first group of awards, 
for independent booths, 
began by presenting last 
years first-place winners, 
KGB, with a plaque. KGB 
took second-place this year 
for their Rats of NIMH 
booth. Third-place was the 
Pioneers Wind in the Wil
lows, with first place going 
to the Asian Students Associ
ations (ASA) Winnie the 
Pooh booth. The ASA repre
sentative made hearty thankyous while hefting a huge 
trophy over his head and 
invited everyone to drink 
with them later.
Wang applauded the effort 
of the independent booths. I 
know all the obstacles they
had to overcome, she said, 
noting the limited funding 
and manpower of such 
booths. When [an indepen
dent booth] stands against a 
frat, it may not look quite as 
impressive, but I know what 
they had to go through to get 
there and they all put in a 
great effort.
The sorority booth awards 
were next. Since last years 
winner was announced first, 
Kappa Alpha Theta could 
have stayed on stage to 
receive the third-place award 
for Thumbelina. Kappa 
Kappa Gammas Paddington 
Bear took second, followed 
by Zeta Psi Sigma, who took 
first with their Charlottes 
Web booth. Zeta chanted 
happily and left the stage for 
Kappa Delta Rho to accept
their Peoples Choice award 
in quiet decorum.
I was glad I wasnt a 
judge, said Wang. They had 
a tough time deciding the 
winners.... There were a lot of 
good booths.
The fraternity booth 
awards were by far the most 
anticipated. Again, last years 
first-place winners were 
announced first. Delta 
Upsilon was given the plaque 
for Santas Workshop. The 
crowd was shushed before 
Sigma Phi Epsilons Dr. 
Seuss was named thirdplace. After the mandatory 
chant stopped, the crowd qui
eted again. The crowd stayed 
silent an extra few seconds as 
the announcer stumbled over 
naming Phi Kappa Thetas

Sweepstakes
PiKA A women garner second consecutive win
ByASEEM S. GUPTA
Tartan Features Editor
Friday morning, after a night of 
heavy rain, the scheduled 7:30 am 
commencement of Sweepstakes 99 
was delayed as the Sweepstakes 
Committee waited for the course to 
dry. Students, alumni, and curious 
onlookers crowded the course while 
cars drove up and down the first 
hill and around the rest of the 
course in an attempt to hasten 
the drying process. Finally, after a 
one-hour rain delay, the first gun 
went off signaling the beginning 
of Sweepstakes 99.
The races were plagued by rain and 
race delays. While the womens teams 
were able to finish their heats last 
Friday, cancellations of the Saturday 
morning races meant that the 
womens preliminary heat times 
would be their final times. PiKA A 
finished the day with a time of 
2:45.92, which was 2.7 seconds 
slower than their first-place time 
last year.
The first heat of the morning 
included PiKAB and Fringe B. While 
both teams were strong on Hill 1,
PiKA B was well ahead of Fringe B by 
the time they had reached the top of 
Hill 2. The downhill portion of the 
course farther separated the two bug
gies, and PiKA B saw no competition 
from Fringe B on Hills 3, 4, and 5. 
PiKA B finished the first heat with a 
time of 2:52.23, which was four sec
onds faster than their fourthplace 
time in the finals last year and their 
time earned them the fifthplace 
spot overall.
This is the best our women have 
rolled in a long time, said Rick Sim
mons, a senior chemical engineering 
major and PiKA Buggy co-chair. We 
were extremely happy about our B 
team, because they were still first 
after a couple of other A teams.
The second heat saw Beta A and 
Spirit B in stiff competition. Both 
teams were strong on Hill 1 and 2, 
and Spirit B managed to keep pace 
with Beta A on the downhill portion 
of the course. Spirit B gained some 
distance on Hill 3, but Beta A passed 
them on Hill 5, taking the heat with a 
time of 2:57.71, which was four sec
onds faster than Spirit B.
After further rain delays, the sun 
briefly came out from behind the omi

nous and dark rain clouds. The third 
heat saw SDC A and Pioneers A tak
ing to the course. It was clear that 
there was to be no competition 
between the two teams when SDC A 
pulled far ahead of Pioneers A on the 
downhill run. SDC A finished the race 
with a time of 2:49.13, a full 14 sec
onds faster than 
Pioneers A.
Were happy and 
the race went 
very well, said 
Sachi Myojin, a 
senior math and 
statistics major 
and a member of 
the SDC team.
She said that the 
team raced well 
on all the hills, 
and that SDC As 
time was good for 
the preliminaries.
We knew PiKA 
and Spirit were 
good, but we were 
hoping we could 
take first [place] 
in the finals.
The Sweep
stakes Commit
tee worked quick
ly to get the next 
heat in before it 
began to rain 
again. The fourth 
heat saw Sig Nu A against CIA A. It 
was clear after the first hill that 
SigNu A would face no competition 
from CIA A, and they stayed far 
ahead throughout the race. Sig Nu A 
had a strong finish with a time of 
2:52.76, which gave the team a sixthplace standing overall, and which 
would have allowed the team to 
advance to the final round.
The fifth heat went ahead despite a 
light drizzle. PiKA A, KDR A, and 
SDC B faced each other in a heat that 
would produce the winner of the 1999 
Womens Sweepstakes.
PiKA A faced no competition after 
Hill 1 and was far ahead of KDR A 
and SDC B halfway through the 
downhill. Even though PiKA A was 
far ahead of the other two teams, the
race still excited the crowd as SDC B 
trailed KDR A by just a few yards on 
the final hill.
PiKA A finished the race with a 
time of 2:45.92, which put them into 
first place, a position which they held 
on to, eventually winning the 
womens Sweepstakes. We felt confirace with a time of 2:47.03, four sec
onds ahead of Fringe A. Spirit A 
placed second overall, and Fringe A 
placed fourth. Our women raced 
very well and they put in 110 percent 
effort, said Elisabeth Brown, a 
sophomore in public policy and man
agement and a member of the Spirit
7mecd Gdid1dSAdmvds dmfmnni Fdsd2wm 
Spirit A women ran the second-fastest time, after being disqualified last year.
dent [that] we would be competitive 
for first place, said Simmons. We 
felt good about our time and [we 
knew we had a chance of winning 
first place] probably right after Truck 
Weekend. KDR A finished 3.12 sec
onds ahead of SDC B with a time of 
2:59.01, and SDC B faced further dis
appointment when they were dis
qualified for failing the drop test.
The sixth heat included one of the 
favorites for first place, Spirit A, 
along with Fringe A and SDC C. 
While SDC C failed to keep up with 
Spirit A and Fringe A, the two leading 
buggies provided a few tense 
moments especially as they raced 
neck and neck around the chute. 
Spirit A eventually prevailed over 
Fringe A on Hill 3 and finished the
team. She added that Spirit A did 
their best on all five hills.
I thought we did really well, and I 
wish we could have raced in finals, 
said Judy Guo, a junior in chemical 
engineering and a member of the 
Fringe team. Count on Fringe to do 
well next year.
Sig Nu B raced alone in a special 
seventh heat because they had been 
given an incorrect start time for their 
original heat.
Overall the rain held off long 
enough for the womens teams to 
finish their heats, though many of 
the captains were disappointed that 
they were unable to compete in a 
final competition, where they felt 
they could improve times 
and rankings.
lRl4UL -mni ud2w ,z
Wizard of Oz second place. 
A large part of the audience 
then began to boo loudly, 
while a group in the back cor
ner began yelling happily. 
The reason for this soon 
became apparent, as Delta 
Upsilon, the same crowd in 
the back corner, was named 
as the first-place booth win
ner for the second year in a 
row for Wheres Waldo?
In addition to causing a 
relocation of the ceremony, 
the weather also played a 
role in booth judging, which 
took place on Friday. A lot of 
organizations were scram
bling to fix up before the 
judges came by, but because 
of the wind and rain, [they] 
were not able to, said Wang. 
Judges understand [the 
problems caused by the 
weather], but some still took 
it as a factor, she said, not
ing that sturdiness is defi
nitely a factor in judging but 
it depended on the judge 
whether that extended to 
wind and waterproofing.
Next were the buggy 
awards, with the Peoples 
Choice leading it off. Sigma 
Nus buggy won this prize, 
followed by the Sweepstakes 
Committee choosing Sigma 
Alpha Epsilons Rubicon as 
their favorite. One surprise
in the ceremony came with 
SAE winning the T-shirt 
design category it was 
greeted largely with silence 
and boos.
Student Dormitory Coun
cils womens A team took 
third' place with a. time 
of 2:49:13. Spirit A captured 
second place with a time 
of 2:47:03, and a quiet 
reception and comments 
about the Pittsburgh weath
er followed.
For the second year in a 
row, PiKAs A team got first 
place, with a time of 2:45:92. 
One may assume thank-yous 
were said, but they couldnt 
be heard over the screaming, 
including a rebel yell 
that isnt usually found this 
far north.
Finally, Sweepstakes Com
mittee handed out the Spirit 
of Buggy awards given to 
groups that helped raise the 
morale of all of the buggy 
teams. One award went to 
Fringe, whose womens Ateam got 4th place, while the 
second award went to Beta 
Theta Pi. The Beta chair 
gave a tongue-in-cheek 
speech about how glad they 
were to make rolling more 
fun for everyone.
Overall, everything went 
pretty smoothly  there 
were a few minor bumps in
the road, nothing major, said 
Wang. The only thing Id 
change next year is 
the weather.
After the mens buggy was 
completed on Sunday morn
ing, the Sweepstakes Com
mittee organized its own 
impromptu ceremony. As if 
Mother Nature were mocking 
them, the sun shone brightly 
for the 5 pm event, which 
finally got underway 35 
minutes later. In the 
meantime, some buggy mem
bers amused themselves 
with their own inebriation, 
and, to emphasize their dom
ination, the PiKA womens 
team brought their firstplace trophy.
When celebrations got 
underway, the number six 
through three finishes 
(Kappa Delta Rho, Pioneers 
A, SDC A, and PiKA B, 
respectively) accepted their 
awards and exited expedi
tiously. The otherwise rowdy 
crowd turned silent as Spirit 
A dedicated its second-place 
trophy to a Spirit alum who 
had recently passed away 
from a brain tumor. PiKA A 
followed by accepting its 
first place trophy with exu
berance and gratitude, 
thanking Spirit and others, 
and vowing to repeat 
in 2000.

1-4 The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  19 April 1999
Carnival goers journey through their childhood
By LORELEI LAIRD
Tartan Forum Editor 
& REBECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Copy Manager
To some last weekend, the 
Morewood parking lot may 
have been a big rain-soaked 
stretch of concrete and noth
ing more. But to those with a 
little bit of imagination, 
Morewood was temporarily 
home to a rosebush full of 
super-intelligent rats, a spe
cial pig and his spider friend, 
and the Emerald City. CMUs 
annual booth competition saw 
all these and more spring to 
life on Midway.
Delta Upsilons Wheres 
Waldo? booth, which took 
first prize in the fraternity 
category this year, featured 
an unconventional booth 
design: a giant Waldo head. 
Visitors entered the booth 
through Waldos right eye and 
exited through his left. 
Inside, a set of stairs led up to 
a platform from which an 
entire miniature world of 
Waldos confronted would-be 
game players.
Featuring different scenes 
in which Waldo was hidden  
a Ferris wheel, the Taj Mahal, 
and an Eskimo igloo, to name 
a few  the game demanded 
that players look for Waldo 
through a pair of binoculars
hard to get in and out of, so 
we wanted to change that.
Design was also a priority 
for Phi Kappa Thetas secondprize-winning Emerald City 
booth. We were inspired to 
do [this theme] because it 
wasnt gonna be a box, said 
Jon Beerhalter, a senior in 
electrical and computer engi
neering (ECE) and Phi Kaps 
booth chair. And we already 
had an idea for the game. 
Inside the bright green, castle-like booth, game players 
guided Dorothy through a 
labyrinth, past the evil 
witchs house and many other 
obstacles, and into the Emer
ald City. It was really good to 
see people come together cre
atively  this is something 
Phi Kap has never done 
before, said Beerhalter.
Some groups booth themes 
sold themselves. Sigma Phi 
Epsilons Oh, The Places 
Youll Go was an easy choice, 
because author Dr. Seuss 
(Theodore Geisel) was a Sig 
Ep himself. The booth was 
conceived as a kind of tribute 
to the late author. Oh, The 
Places Youll Go was [Geisels] 
last book, so I guess that was 
our inspiration, said junior 
mechanical engineering 
major and Sig Ep brother 
Ryan Chew. Decorated with a 
plaque in memory of Geisel,

and push a button when they 
found him, activating a light 
if they were correct. Lining 
the walls were framed pic
tures of Waldo with famous or 
legendary people such as 
Santa Claus, Gandhi, and 
President Clinton.
We chose Wheres Waldo 
because its fun and non-traditional, said Todd Kahili, a 
senior civil engineering major 
and DUs booth chair. We 
knew nobody else would come 
up with it. And the giant 
head design? We did it to 
improve the traffic flow, said 
Kahili. [Many booths] were
0we9 6dpmdSAdmvds lmv Uvd--
the booth also featured three 
Seussian birds heads popping 
up from the second-floor bal
cony and walls garnished 
with excerpts from the book.
The booths game had three 
parts, corresponding to parts 
of the book. In the first part of 
the game, visitors guided a 
balloon to the top of the booth 
through trees and other 
obstacles. In the second part, 
painted feet guided visitors 
through papier-mache birds 
heads on the second story of 
the booth. Finally, players 
rolled balls up a mountain 
and back down into one of 
three cups for a prize  suc
cess, according to Geisel, is 
ninety-eight and three-quar
ters percent guaranteed!
Since the theme this year 
was childrens books, many 
groups had fun delving into 
their collective memories for 
the story that could lead to 
the perfect booth. We kept 
thinking of all the stories we 
knew as kids and this one
kept popping up, said sopho
more civil engineering major 
Rhonda Forrester of Zeta Psi 
Sigmas Charlottes Web 
booth. We could think of a 
pretty cool design for this 
[book] and a pretty cool game, 
so we decided to go with 
this one.
Zetas booth was a bright 
red barn, complete with 
gabled roof; its walls sported 
paintings of Wilbur the pig, 
Charlotte the spider, and 
their other friends, both ani
mal and human. Zeta didnt 
miss a detail in creating a 
farm-like atmosphere, carpet
ing the floor with bales of hay 
and wearing overalls and 
plaid shirts. The game 
required players to fling para
chuting spiders down on a 
board. They won different 
prizes, depending on where 
they landed.
But the most meaningful 
part of booth for Zeta came 
when they were building it, 
according to Forrester. When 
we put the [roof] support up 
and realized it was going to 
stay, that was really cool, 
she said. It took half the 
sisters to do it, but we all 
really came together. All of 
that hard work and coopera
tion paid off, as Charlottes 
Web took first-place honors 
among sororities.
The second place sorority 
booth was Kappa Kappa 
Gammas Paddington Bearinspired Kappa Kaboose. 
The booth took the shape of .a 
train caboose. Outside, a 
giant stuffed Paddington 
Bear sat surrounded by pack
ages. Inside, bench seats, cur
tained windows, and a small 
tea table came together to 
suggest the interior of a 
British train. Kappas game 
gave participants three turns 
rolling a ball down a slanted 
wooden plane. As a prize, 
everyone got to choose some
thing from Paddingtons toy 
chest. We like to find a game 
where all the children 
who come through can 
win something, said junior 
materials science and engi
neering major and Kappa sis
ter Elise Selinger.
Selinger stressed the neces
sity of thinking strategically 
while choosing a booth theme. 
Basically, you have an idea 
and you see if you can get a 
structure and a game to go 
with it, said Selinger. Refer
ring to the rain that plagued 
Carnival Weekend on and 
off, she continued: Were 
happy we chose [a structure] 
with a roof.
Kappa Kappa Gamma was 
not the only organization to 
take note of the rain. Kappa 
Alpha Theta was grateful for 
their solidly built, manysided wooden roof, which also 
helped them garner third 
prize in the sorority category. 
The sororitys Thumbelina 
booth was designed to look 
like a thimble on the outside, 
garnished with a sign shaped 
like a giant pansy. Inside, 
it was decorated with 
scenes of tiny Thumbelinas 
adventures amid giant flow
ers and plants.
We wanted something that 
we could get into, something 
that helped us come together 
as a group, [which is what] 
Carnival is really about, said 
Nitya Venkataraman, a
sophomore in anthropology 
and history and a Theta. Visi
tors to Thumbelinas world 
rolled a ball into one of three 
slots in a leaf, one of which 
contained her prince and two 
of which contained bad guys.
The first-place winner in 
the independent booth cate
gory, the Asian Students 
Association (ASA), chose Win
nie the Pooh as the theme of 
their booth. [Winnie] is one 
of the best-selling toys, so we 
decided to do this booth 
because it would attract peo
ple, said ASA booth co-chair 
and second-year architecture 
student Wayne Chang. Inside 
the papier-mache and wood 
structure of the booth was 
enough Winnie to placate the 
most ardent Pooh fan. The 
interior, designed to look like 
Winnies house, featured 
papier-mache, wire, and felt 
replicas of Pooh, Piglet, and 
other characters, and a game 
centered around knocking 
over pots full of hunny.
If ASAs booth was inspired 
by a chubby bear, KGBs 
booth starred an animal that 
would seem even more unap
pealing  the rat. The booth, 
second-ranked among the 
independents, was based on 
the novel Mrs. Frisby and the 
Rats of NIMH. This book 
relates the adventures of a 
pack of brilliant rats who 
escape from the National 
Institute for Mental Health to 
live in a farmers rosebush. 
They soon make friends with 
Mrs. Frisby, a mouse, and 
must use all their intelligence 
to move her and her home 
when she finds herself in the 
path of a plow.
NIMH wasnt KGBs first 
choice, according to junior 
psychology major Chuck 
Werner. We usually do a 
Russian theme, but we didnt 
think Crime and Punishment 
would go over well, so we 
went with our backup book, 
said Werner. Besides, theyre 
geeky rats since theyre high
ly intelligent, so we thought 
that was kind of appropriate.
KGBs game used pulleys to 
move Mrs. Frisby and her 
cement house to a safe place. 
The outside of the booth 
looked like a rosebush, and 
the inside was a dark hiding 
place with a giant tree in 
the center.
Third place in the indepen
dent category went to Pio
neers for their Toad Hall 
booth. Fashioned after Toads

house from The Wind in the 
Willows, it featured realistic 
brick paneling and a carpeted 
staircase up to the second 
story. Such complexity was a 
long time in the coming, 
according to Pioneers booth 
chair Mark Stover, a senior in 
industrial management. We 
actually didnt finish [build
ing our booth] last year, so 
this is our big rebuild year. 
We wanted something to 
show that Pioneers is back.
Visitors to Toad Hall were 
led up to the balcony, where 
they were given the chance to 
battle a row of the evil rats 
that plague Frog and Toad in 
the stories. When the red eyes 
of the rats lit up, players 
bashed them with a mallet.
Games were perhaps most 
central to the series of Blitz 
booths that lined one section 
of Midway. Blitz booths, 
which debuted only last year, 
are smaller non-competitive 
booths whose category was 
designed to include smaller 
organizations in the 
booth-making fun 
without exhausting 
their budgets. And it 
was fun, according to 
Society of Women Engi
neers member Wh 
iavlova, 
junior in comput
er science. We 
thought it would be 
fun to do something 
together. It was our first 
time building a booth, and
everybody helped out, said 
Pavlova.
SWEs booth, which was 
themed after the Berenstein 
Bears, invited visitors to toss 
beanbags into the Bears lair 
for prizes. Were definitely 
going to make a blitz booth 
next year, said Pavlova. 
Were thinking of making a[n 
independent-category] booth 
[next year].
Visitors from outside CMU 
enjoyed the Midway as well. 
A lot of [the booths] were 
really fun, said Alexandra 
Stillson, an eighth-grader at 
a local junior high school. She 
named ASAs Winnie the Pooh 
booth and the Japanese Cul
ture Clubs Blitz booth, where 
visitors scooped fish out of a 
tank using rice paper, as two 
of her favorites.

Mobot race sees first machine to finish course
By SETH MANDEL
Personnel Manager
Since Bothell is a member of the 
mobot committee, his creation was 
entered as an open exhibition and 
was not eligible for any of the mone
tary prizes. Shortly after his mile
stone, however, Bothells record was 
broken by second-year electrical and 
computer engineering, graduate stu
dents Phil Herget and Jason 
Messier, whose Moby Wan Kenobi 
completed the course more quickly 
than DJB V did. This win earned 
the team the $250 prize in the open 
category, which is for graduate stu
dents, staff, faculty, and anyone else 
associated with the University other 
than undergraduates. Although no 
undergraduates completed the 
course, the top mobots performed 
better than those of past years. 
Marvin, a mobot built by first-place 
winner and sophomore computer sci
ence major Dan Maynes-Aminzade, 
completed nine gates in 3:05. Making 
it through eight gates in 3:44 and 
coming in second place was junior 
computer science major Merle 
Romesbergs Mmm Bot.
Rounding out the top three was 
Predator, built by James Bruce, a 
junior computer science major, and 
Joshua Anhalt, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major. 
These three participants earned 
monetary prizes of $1,000, $500, and 
$250, respectively. In addition,
For the first time in the events 
five-year history, a mobot (MObile 
roBOT) crossed the finish line of the 
Mobot Slalom Race course. In order 
to complete the course, a mobot must 
traverse a series of 14 gates spread 
along a white line painted on the 
sidewalk outside of Wean and 
Doherty Halls.
Two steep hills and a series of 
branching forks, known as decision 
points, make finishing the course 
extremely challenging, according 
to participants.
Despite the difficulty of the course, 
Dan Bothells DJB V became the 
first mobot ever to successfully pass 
through Gate 14. Bothell, who has 
competed since the events inception, 
has won the competition in previous 
years. Ive been trying [to complete 
the course] for five years. This was the 
first time I thought I really could do 
it, said Bothell, a staff member of the 
Psychology Department and 1996 
computer science graduate.

Last Friday, the New York-based band, Soul Coughing, performed songs from 
including their newest release El Oso.
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Soul Coughing is a peculiar band. 
This might not be news to fans of 
the band, but its essential to be 
able to understand what sort of 
rock-and-roll flavor the band 
brought to last Friday nights ABsponsored concert in Skibo Gym. 
From the complex, jazzy rhythms 
to the variety of sounds produced 
by the keyboardist, the band put 
together an interesting package, 
topped ofFby frontman M. Doughty.
A former music critic, the bespec
tacled Doughty doesnt look like 
the typical rock singer, but a closer 
listen to the bands nonsense lyrics 
and tricky arrangements put things
into perspective.
Returning after a two-year absence, 
opening act Angry Salad began the show 
with their second Carnival appearance. 
While not as clever as Soul Coughing, 
Angry Salad proved to be an effective 
and even engaging warm-up band. Not 
hard enough to be classified as punk and 
not as edgy as a good alt-rock band, 
Angry Salads sound strongly echoed 
modern-rockers like Third Eye Blind 
and Matchbox 20. However, some strong 
guitar work and the vocal range of singer 
Bob Whelan allowed them to avoid the 
blandness characteristic of most bands.
Even though Angry Salad is probably a 
bit too pop-sounding for most college stu
dents tastes, the band displayed a genu
ine knack for songs which were catchy 
without being annoying, and played their
way through their 
half-hour set with a 
remarkable zeal that 
challenged the audi
ence not to like them 
at least a little bit.
If Skibo Gym 
seems like a lessthan-ideal venue for 
a rock concert, well,- 
it is ' but the techni
cians worked well to 
keep the acoustics 
sharp, and a reason
able crowd showed 
up to check out the 
show. Eventually, 
the band they came 
to see, Soul Cough
ing, made their way 
to the stage.
On their three stu
dio albums, the band 
oc,a, r.ujcuu, ,v.a..aec, was able to roll all of 
their three albums, its elements into neat 
funk-rock packages, 
yet when performed 
live, the bands depth lost a bit of its 
novelty: Doughtys unusual mannerisms 
and hyperactive vocal style won the crowd 
over quickly as the band opened with a few 
funk numbers with definite danceable 
qualities.
A strong version of their recent radio 
hit Circles capped off a remarkable 
opening salvo. However, as the show 
rolled on, the fans became less attuned 
to the bands efforts.
Perhaps the problem is that Soul 
Coughing, unlike Angry Salad, didnt 
build their reputation through concerts. 
Their strength is tricky, thoughtful rock, 
with a certain degree of subtlety, some
thing which makes for often-compelling 
music but a muddled performance. Sure, 
jam bands like Dave Matthews and 
Phish can rivet audiences with long instrumental passages, but Soul Cough
ing was not quite as successful.
At the conclusion of their regular set, 
the band broke into Super Bon Bon, one 
of their most engaging tracks; it proved to 
be a highlight of the evening. Other num
bers also worked well, but Super Bon 
Bon and Circles were without excep
tion their most hook-filled and linear songs.
While Super Bon Bon would have 
been an ideal closer, the band elected to 
return for a three-song encore which 
again veered into tunelessness. Like I
said earlier, Soul Coughing is a 
peculiar band, and their nuances 
and quirks help the band craft 
some excellent songs.
The only problem is that no mat
ter how strong these songs are, they 
simply dont translate well to the 
stage, where raw power is at a much 
higher premium. Hopefully, Soul 
Coughing will be able to focus their 
future efforts into songs that 
concertgoers as well as CD buyers 
can appreciate.

Audience steps aside, lets the band go through
ticing a much bigger growth in 
college because people can hear 
it. They can come see it. And I 
think its really important for 
us. You can hear three songs on 
a radio, you can buy the record 
and like it, but real word of 
mouth travels after people see 
us.
TT: How would you place El 
Oso compared to your other al
bums?
MA: The best.
SS: Yellow.
MA: Third. I mean its the 
third best album weve ever had.

TT: This years Spring Carni
val theme is childrens books. 
What is your favorite childrens 
book?
SS: Good Night Moon.
MA: [Laughs] Just everybody 
has that book. Its ridiculous. 
Theres a really cool story called 
Teenie Tiny. A teenie tiny lady 
and her teenie tiny cat go to a 
teenie tiny graveyard and picks 
up a teenie tiny bone and has big 
big nightmares that scares the 
ghost away. Thats a good story.
SS: Sounds pretty awful.
MA: Or actually the Dr. Seuss 
Sleep Book. Little Miss Helpful.
SS: Fannie Hill.
TT: Whats your favorite carni
val ride?
MA: In Italy, and Ive seen them 
in the states as well, theres this 
small two-man iron cage chained 
to two of these huge bungie cords 
which are attached to pulleys, 
they are like five stories high.
Youre on the ground held by a 
magnet, and then that magnet

Tartan News Editor
Soul Coughing, once a 
New York club band, has 
recently emerged as one of 
the most creative music 
groups to hit the charts in 
recent years. Hits like 
Circles, off their new al
bum El Oso, have cata
pulted them into the main
stream. Still, they havent 
lost their fresh, sometimes 
nerdy flavor. Before the con
cert Friday night, The Tar
tan was given the opportu
nity to talk to bassist 
Sebastian Steinberg and 
keyboard and sampling wiz
ard Mark de Gil Antoni 
about everything from 
childrens books to new 
projects.
The Tartan: Have you 
been performing at a lot of 
colleges recently?
Mark de Gil Antoni: Not a 
ton. Its that time of the year, 
April-May is when most 
universities entertainment 
sponsors an event, so now is 
the time of year you do it.
TT: How do you like tour
ing colleges versus other 
places?
MA: I just wish they 
werent always in gyms. The 
energy is always really high, 
and that is the most impor
tant thing. But that extra 
candy of great sound could 
benefit from theaters, which 
Im sure most schools have. 
The acoustics can be con
tained a little better.
TT: Would you have pre
ferred an outdoor concert?
MA: That depends too,
that can be just as wishy-washy. 
No, not today. [Laughs]
TT: How do you make the tran
sition from the studio to the stage? 
Which do you prefer?
Sebastian Steinberg: The tran
sition is easy. We just put every
thing in a truck. We like both.
TT: Whats the funniest or 
worst concert experience that 
youve had?
MA: John Popper came out and 
played with us once and jammed 
on his harmonica, and we did 
Down to This, and he was wear
ing his cutlass. [Laughs]
SS: That wasnt the worst ex
perience though.
MA: That was the funniest; it 
was odd. He was pretty good, I 
have to say.
SS: I was once on stage with a 
guy that had a heart attack. But 
thats another story for another 
day. [Pauses] OK, we were play
ing Freddys Dead. But he lived.
TT: Do you feel you appeal to 
the college audience and why?
MA: Our audience is actually 
kind of blind, in terms of age 
group. We definitely dont hit 
the hard-core teens, because its 
a little bit not rock, and were 
not getting mellow 20s and 30s 
crowds. We tend to get people 
who are slightly more indepen
dent, which is a broad age group. 
The college audience has grown 
a little later for us. I think 
unfortunately thats because a 
lot of early touring was through 
clubs that were 21 and older. 
There was a good three years 
where it seemed like we were 
always going to a city, and were 
playingto kids 20,21, and older. 
Over the last couple of years 
weve had a chance to play big
ger venues, and now were no
bumper cars I think.
TT: What do you read? 
Do you write poetry? 
Where do you get the ideas 
for the lyrics from?
SS: Advertising compa
nies.
MA: Doughty is the only 
one that writes the words, 
but we know him so well. 
He is a poet, but his method 
also incorporates
recapitalization. He can 
get a phrase from any
where, and it will find its 
way into the lyric. A lot of 
the printed text will get in.
SS: And Yuval Gabay.
TT: What projects are 
you working on next?
MA: For Soul Coughing, 
its really taking matters 
into our own hands right 
now. Were becoming a re
ally independent band in 
an organizational way.
Look for
SoulCougliingRadio.com. I 
think thats where yvere 
headed, a way to release 
more independent things, so 
were establishing avenues 
and methods for that. 
Rather than record these 
new crosses every two years 
when we build a new reli
gious symbol that the world 
will hopefully buy lots of, 
you can have less emphasis 
on these icons that have to 
be presented to the market
place. It would be nice to 
regularly speak the music. 
I mean we play music live so 
often, there should be some 
kind of correlation in terms 
of the way we are in the 
studio working or writing 
together.

keyboardist, (R) took time for a pre-concert interview.

Music
Carnival concert highlights women of note
By ROB JEFFERSON
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday night, the 
rain laid waste to the begin
ning of Carnival. Despite 
the sogginess of the situa
tion, the show went on un
der the dryness (though not 
warmth) of the Midway 
tent. Lis Harvey and Janet 
Robin put on two solid and 
generally well-received per
formances, despite the in
clement weather.
Both performers were 
firmly entrenched in the 
singer-songwriter form, 
somewhere in the broad ex
panse between the navet 
of Jewel and the focused 
shards of bitterness of Ani 
DiFranco, but closer to the 
latter. While one would have 
expected the performance 
to be a series of rants and 
diatribes against past lov
ers, there was an air of relaxation 
and humor that was refreshing.
Lis Harvey, a junior creative 
writing major at CMU, was first 
on the stage with her set. Even if 
the music was lacking, her stage 
presence was more than ad
equate. Harveys banter with the 
audience touched upon many is
sues, including the nature of 
rants, the process of recording 
music, and the idea of dropping 
out of school.
The music was from her album 
Periphery and the upcoming Teen 
Angst EP. Many of her songs had 
a similar level of wry humor, 
which elicited occasional chuck
les from the audience. In one song, 
the chorus, which proclaimed her 
hate for everyone, was less of a 
cry of angst than an effective 
parody against it. A work called 
Rant was just that: a sprawling 
yet focused statement flogging 
anything and everything that 
managed to combine bitterness
4npes Adg-idssSAdmvds .ynvn Uvd-- 
Janet Robin played from her new album, Periphery.
with laughter.
Harveys 
overall tech
nique was gen
erally standard 
fare. She used 
the guitar al
most as a 
rhythm instru
ment, with vig
orous strum
ming propelling 
the music. Fur
ther, Harvey is 
no stranger to 
the practice of 
syllable-stuff
ing, wherein 
more syllables 
are crammed 
into a bar of a 
song than the 
meter permits. 
However, the 
music itself had enough 
strength to use
the potential weaknesses profit
ably.
After Harveys performance, 
Janet Robin played a set. Robin 
is currently on tour across the 
U.S. to support her new album 
Open the Door. Unlike on the 
album, where she played with a 
band, Robin performed the 
show solo.
This brought a clearer perspec
tive upon her music and made 
the added musicians on the CD 
seem more of an obstacle to the 
message. The set itself followed 
in a similar vein as Harveys. 
Most of the songs were punctu
ated with conversation, even a 
few goodbyes to people who left in 
between songs. There was an air 
of joviality amidst the bitterness, 
an unwillingness to be taken too 
seriously; Robin even gave out 
Pez dispensers to lucky purchas
ers of her CD. The songs them
selves generally had rhythmic ve
locity going for them as well.
However, Robins songs 
find themselves mixing 
simple chord progressions 
with subtle ties, which be
come less and less clear 
over time. Combined with 
lyrics that paint detailed 
pictures in a minimum of 
language, she made a 
simple but powerful per
formance. Occasionally, 
Robin would draw out the 
song slightly longer than 
necessary, which became 
fairly distracting and de
tracted from the overall ef
fect of the show.
Small problems aside, 
Lis Harvey and Janet 
Robin both provided a won
derful show to open up the 
first evening of Carnival.

Jazz band decides to get funky with audience
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday, inside of the Car
nival tent, the student jazz band 
29 wailed. Although the crowd was 
not as large as the band had hoped 
for, many of those in attendance 
agreed that the turnout had more 
to do with the venue and the 
weather than the skill of the band. 
Tent acoustics do nobody justice, 
said Jason Cohen, a student who 
attended the show, Theyre the 
most innovative student band Ive 
seen.
The band proved just how inno
vative it was by varying from its 
usual lineup of jazz tunes to in
clude a few funk numbers, includ
ing Nothing Personal, Song for 
Bilboa, Superstition, and Sex 
Machine among others. The deci
sion to vary from jazz was a very 
conscious one, according to sopho-mnro nrnfoccinncil nm'finrr moinr
Eric Spaulding, the bands tenor saxo
phone player. Spaulding called funk, 
music for the people and added that 
the band thought that it might get the 
crowd dancing more easily than jazz. 
Band keyboardist Adam Waite, a junior 
musical composition major, agreed, say
ing that, while the band doesnt usually 
play funk, we knew we had to change 
our style to fit the venue.
This change involved the addition of 
guitar player Brendan Bosworth to 29s 
usual lineup. Bosworth, who can nor
mally be seen playing with fellow stu
dent band Red Star Mission, said that 
he was very pleased to be asked to sit in 
with the band. This senior professional 
writing major added that the request 
was even more delightful considering 
that it came only about a month before 
the end of school. Ill be outta here in a 
few weeks, he said, so it was a real 
honor to play with them [before gradua
tion].
Bosworths bandmate, Ben Schultz, 
ipn two numbers, Superstition and Sex Machine. Usually a 
bass player in Red Star Mission, Schultz 
acted as the lead singer for those two 
songs, telling the crowd, a la James 
Brown, I wanna get groovin.  Later, 
he tried to entice them to Get on up. 
When asked how he felt about the mesh
ing of the two bands, Schultz, a senior 
professional writing major, said, Red 
Star Mission and 29 are bands, but 
were all musicians. The point is to just 
play music.
And play they did, holding the small 
but dedicated crowd for over two hours. 
In addition to Spaulding and Waite, 
the band also includes bassist Matt 
Arnoff and drummer George Chow. 
The group clearly enjoyed performing 
with each other and sharing laughs 
and joking between songs. This enthu
siasm added a new dimension to the 
songs. Senior mechanical engineering 
major Janae Lowe commented on this 
enthusiasm, and said of the group, 
[29] has a lot of energy...They got the 
groove.
It may be this groove which at
tracted such a wide audience to the 
show. Everyone from students at 
other colleges to teachers and staff 
were in attendance. The band even 
caught the attention of 79-year-old 
Jane Ford, a member of the gradu
ating class of 1932. Although Ford 
came to Carnival to visit with her 
grandson, she was attracted into 
the main tent by the good rhythmic 
sounds of the band.
Also in attendance was Eric 
Riebling, the bass player from 
The Gathering Field, a Pittsburgh 
band whose single Id Believe in 
God for You has recently at
tracted national attention. 
Riebling came to hear 29 upon 
the request of Spaulding, who has 
been communicating with him 
over email for a few months. Hav
ing him there really validated 
the whole thing for me, said 
Spaulding, because I am like the 
Gathering Fields biggest fan.

CMUs Spring Carnival closed 
out last Saturday night with a 
performance by the Fuzzy Com
ets. The cold weather perme
ated the tent, and there was 
hope that the concert would have 
been worth shivering over. 
While the show had its mo
ments, the band was ultimately 
disappointing.
One of Pittsburghs fastestrising bands, the Fuzzy Com
ets, played a dazzling mixture 
of music and cite influences as 
diverse as jazz, alternative rock, 
and Appalachian folk. These 
sounds pop up intermittently, 
but the thrust of their sound is 
wedded to adult contemporary. 
Perhaps the band to which they 
sounded closest was 10,000 Ma
niacs, with lead singer Mel
issa Ippolito sounding 
unnervingly like Natalie Mer
chant in places. While its 
quite common for groups to 
have the sound of their influ
ences, the Fuzzy Comets man
aged to take the sound of 10,000 
Maniacs without also taking the 
spirit. Occasionally, the group 
would drift off into folk and jazz 
territories, where they sounded 
uncertain, yet quite promising 
and spirited. However, these
times were rare.
The performance itself was 
competent. Percussionist Heidi 
Kohne and bassist Matt 
Campbell provided a solid mu
sical foundation that created 
driving rhythms and subtleties 
with equal ease. Chris 
Carnevali on guitar and Megan 
Williams playing violin and 
mandolin developed interesting 
melodies with a fair amount of 
interplay. With Ippolitos vocals, 
the group was instrumentally 
talented.
However, the instrumental 
talent did not translate to sonic 
innovation.
The feeling one had when lis
tening to the Fuzzy Comets was 
that of sheer familiarity. The
mentioned 10,000 Mani
acs, but also Phil Collins 
and even the Police. Yet, 
there were signs at points 
that the band realized the 
sound of their influences. 
One song had a sound 
faintly reminiscent of 
Michael Jacksons Billie 
Jean.
The group actually 
steered in the direction of 
the influence, segueing 
into the chorus of the 
Jackson song before re
turning to their own.

Comedy
Improv troupe drives audience to stitches
Pir TTT AI MU Rm ATVTn C. . i -1 i 1 , , , . . ... _By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
What do you get when you cross 
Camelot, ear wax, nipple rings, and 
a bunch of energetic extroverts? 
You have another zany improv show 
brought to you by the quick wits of 
the No Parking Players (NPP). With 
their usual Skibo venue packed 
nearly to capacity, NPP played off 
the audiences energy and deliv
ered a show with few, if any, dull 
moments.
The evening opened with a round 
of Jeopardy, which included an 
eclectic group of contestants rangr[7'rr
0we9 6dpmdSAdmvds lmv Uvd--
ing from an arrogant rich man to a 40- 
year-old woman named Gladys. Audi
ence members offered topics such as 
the aforementioned ear wax for the con
testants to wager on, and come up with 
responses as random as the topic itself. 
The game was likely one of the high
lights of the evening, as the players 
deftly handled offbeat topics and suited 
their answers to their equally offbeat 
characters.
Next up was Tagline, a game which 
involves two audience members. The 
idea of the game is for two players to 
create a scene from an audience sug
gestion, and, at key points, tap one of 
the audience members on the back and 
have them spurt out whatever first 
comes to mind at that point. This was 
the only slow portion of the evening, as 
some of the suggestions were difficult 
to fit into any scene, much less one 
about being on a Ferris wheel.
However, NPP made up for it with 
Chain Murder Mystery, in which 
members try to communicate the loca
tion, occupation, and weapon involved 
in a murder without speaking in words. 
It may seem difficult to tell someone 
that a murder had taken place in a 
trash dumpster by a shoe-shiner with a 
banana peel, but such a conglomera
tion is the stuff NPP thrives on, and
playing charades while speaking in gib
berish was just like walking and chew
ing gum.
During Slide Show, the audience 
was given a lecture on how exactly En
glish muffins are split with a fork, along 
with numerous 
slides to help 
visualize the 
facts. In this 
game, members 
of NPP create 
odd positions 
whenever the 
lecturer gives 
the cue, and 
then he or she 
must explain 
the slide and 
how it illus
trates his point.
Only at an 
NPP show can 
you come away 
with the knowl
edge that when 
splitting an En
glish muffin, a 
spork is far su
perior to an av
erage kitchen 
fork.
Another high
point of the evening came during Party 
Quirks, in which one player is hosting 
a party, unaware that his guests all 
have odd characteristics which he must 
attempt to figure out during the course 
of the party. This time around, the host

had to cater to a man with two 
glass eyes, a 4,000-year-old 
man, and someone who was 
slowly disappearing. It would 
be hard to imagine an audience 
member not laughing when the 
man with two glass eyes 
popped one out into his drink, 
and, in an attempt to re
place it, substituted an ice 
cube. This game was very 
quick and one of the funnier 
games of the evening.
The evening culminated 
with NPPs trademark 
Countdown, where three 
members try to create a scene 
in 60 seconds, and then work 
their way down to 7.5 sec
onds, backwards. Trying to 
fix a flat tire on the scaffold
ing in the Sistine Chapel in 
7.5 seconds seemed like a 
near-impossible feat, but 
they pulled it off with appar
ent ease.
The show was definitely a 
success, and the increased 
audience attendance at such 
a welldone show could quite 
possibly create the sort of 
regular turnout that the 
players crave.

complained about

Randy Kagan was funny, 
with a lot of dirty jokes, 
and got the crowd into it. 
Tim Beggy, even though 
hes from Pittsburgh and

guy, was not very funny at 
all and needs to work on

clean, which might indicate why 
he had some trouble following 
Randy Kagan. Most people left 
during his routine, and the few 
that stayed kept shouting en

humorous sections; for example,

Drama and Music
Theater group plays it cool during performances
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
There was a rumble in Rangos 
this weekend as the Sharks and 
the Jets duked it out in Scotch n 
Sodas spring musical, West Side 
Story. With dramatic duets and 
choreographed dance sequences 
galore, the cast of West Side Story, 
which was directed by sophomore 
drama major Virginia Bond, 
brought to life the story of two 
star-crossed lovers separated 
by the prejudices of two innercity gangs.
Sophomore music major 
Catherine Walker and first-year 
music major Joe Haughton gave 
strong performances as the 
musicals main characters, Maria 
and Tony. Walker fit perfectly 
into the role of a young Puerto 
Rican woman, anxious to begin 
her life as a free, fun-loving 
American girl.
Particularly in the culminat
ing scenes, Walker was able to 
capture superbly the anguish her 
character experienced during the
course of the story.
Haughton delivered a 
convincing performance 
as the love-struck Tony.
A finely tuned tenor,
Haughton captured the 
audience with his second 
solo number of the 
evening, Maria. He ap
peared to reach difficult 
notes almost effortlessly.
The two worked together 
quite nicely and managed 
to believably portray love 
at first sight while avoid
ing the cheesiness that 
often plagues musical 
love stories.

arts major Kate Tellers

as Anita and Bernardo. As the leader
of the Sharks, Parent displayed copi

screamed disgust. Tellers fit well into

While the dancing seemed to be a bit 
out-of-unison in places, the choreogra
phy was able to fit the mood of each 
scene. Sophomore business major Chris
Ballroom was transformed into an inner-city battleground. The creation of 
a balcony gave additional credibility to 
Tony and Marias love scenes, while 
the painted brick backdrop and mul
tiple doors gave the look and feel 
of dark urban alley ways that 
seemed to give more room for 
maneuvering in an otherwise 
limited performance space.
The pit orchestra handled 
Leonard Bernsteins difficult 
score with accuracy and preci
sion. Syncopated rhythms and 
frequently changing time signa
tures were executed with ease, 
and the orchestra, led by firstyear drama major Habib Azar, 
added a strong musical back
ground to tense scenes.
The hard work put in by over 
50 people was certainly evident 
during Saturday nights perfor
mance. Playing to a full house, 
the actors, crew members, and 
musicians brought many to tears 
at the culmination of this tragic 
tale.
The moral message of the 
show came through loud and 
clear; that hating your fellow 
man because of the color of his 
skin can bring only suffering,

overcome it.Fine-tuned a cappella concert captures audience

tendance continually grew until 
it was standing-room only in the 
Main Stage tent on the rainy 
Midway. Unfortunately, the in
clement weather created a halfhour postponement at the begin
ning of the show: One of the acts 
was caught in traffic.
We left Virginia at around 
6:30 or 7 in the morning. We 
were doing fine until we hit a 
monsoon on the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike, said Jason Baker, 
president of the Academical Vil
lage People (AVP) from the Uni
versity of Virginia.
CMUs own Sound Bytes was 
the first group to take the stage.
The 10 members per
formed a mix of a 
cappella songs and 
popular covers, with 
different members 
alternating as the 
lead singer. These 
covers included 
George Michaels 
Faith, Fastballs 
The Way, and 
Madonnas La Isla 
Bonita.
It was an emo
tional performance 
for the group because 
it was the last set for 
singer Philip Berne, a masters 
student in English who will fin
ish his studies this May. With a 
dedication to Berne, the mem
bers showed lively chemistry
which the audience enjoyed. The 
Sound Bytes received a standing 
ovation following. Their act cul
minated with Princes Kiss, 
which featured Russell Kaplan, 
a junior drama major who sang 
most of the song in a falsetto 
voice.
AVP took the stage after the 
Sound Bytes. Their all-male 16- 
member group won third place 
at last years National Champi
onships of Collegiate a cappella 
as well as recently earned three 
Contemporary A Cappella Re
cording Awards nominations.
Like the Sound Bytes AVP suc
cessfully had the crowd tapping 
their toes during several popu
lar cover songs.
We want you guys to have a 
wild time: get up and dance, or 
just cuddle up to your neighbor, 
. said the group at the beginning 
of their act.
With rhythmic dancing and oc
casional back flips in the back
ground, AVPs singing ranged 
from Just Like You from the 
Jungle Book, to 311s All Mixed 
Up, to the Backstreet Boys Ev
erybody. Nevertheless, the most 
enthusiastic reaction from the 
audience came during their ver
sion of Hall and Oatess 
Maneater. They kept the cho
rus and several of the verses 
intact but added a few lines dedi
cated to Monica Lewinsky.
The last group to take the stage
was the fourman group Mini
mum Wage from 
New York City.
Decked out in 
greasy aprons, 
lunch-ladyhats, 
and taped 
Buddy Holly 
glasses, it did 
not take long for 
people to pick up 
on their quirky

It all started when one day we 
were just sitting around in one of 
our backyards in Denver and we 
just said, Hey, lets get up and 
sing the theme song to Gilligans

memeber of Minimum Wage.
Such comedy was the back

with the traditional lyrics, until 
they asked the crowd for some 
suggestions. When they received 
responses such as panhandler, 
stripper, and gynecologist, the 
lead singer would improvise lyr
ics on stage.
Unlike many of the other events 
during Carnival weekend, there 
were very few audience members 
leaving early to explore other activities. The 
three groups at 
Chewbacappella 
successfully held 
their spectators

turning to their own.
During the latter part of the 
concert, the few people left who 
were braving the cold along with 
the band were treated to songs 
that drifted away from their for' mula. One song was a fairly driv
ing instrumental which allowed 
the group to improvise a bit, show
ing a fair amount of potential.
Another piece included skill
ful mandolin playing, develop
ing a folk sound without sound
ing altogether derivative. Even 
the last few songs in their main 
musical thrust were of better 
quality, sounding significantly 
less influenced.
Despite the better sound of the 
show by the end, the concert was at 
best mediocre. There was a great
deal of potential for a memo
rable performance, but a 
lack of quality songwriting 
led to its downfall. The Fuzzy 
Comets, however, showed 
that they have the ability to 
create capitvating and interestingmusic. We can only 
hope that they will someday 
decide to continue in 
this direction.
