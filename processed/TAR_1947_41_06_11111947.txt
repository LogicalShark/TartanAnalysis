Open Letter To The Students
Following :the advice of the Student Conference com
mittee, I have arranged for a different kind of program for 
the exercises on Carnegie Day, November 25, at 11:00 a. m.
The members of the committee indicated that the stu
dents have looked upon Carnegie Day exercises as merely 
a field day for those few who would be called to the several 
honorary societies. Since this is certainly not the intention 
of the administration, I want the program to be changed so 
that the meeting will be what is intendedto bring together 
the students of all three colleges for a program of interest to 
ALL students. And Mr. Stanley March and I, with the help 
of the Student Conference committee, are planning such a 
program.
One major change concerns the subject of my talk to 
the students. I shall make this the occasion for telling the stu
dents about important developments here at school during the 
past year and about plans for the futurea sort of state 
of the nation speech. There will be other changes, too, 
which we believe will interest all of you.
I hope that everyone will make it a point to attend the 
exercises to hear the latest word about campus activities.
Sincerely yours,
ROBERT E. DOHERTY.

Rising Wholesale Food Cost 
Responsible For Skibo Prices
Prices Were At OP A Level Until October 1; 
Latest Increase is From 10 to 15 Percent
Food prices went up at Skibo November 1 because of rising 
wholesale food costs, said Miss Inez White, Skibo manager, last 
week. She stated that the cost of food to customers had been held 
down as long as possible, but that when rising wholesale prices 
presaged a loss at the old consumer rates, the increase became neces
sary.
Prices at Skibo had clung to the OP A level from April 1943 
until this past October 1. On this<> 
latter date a general price raise 
of from three to five per cent went 
into effect. The latest increase is 
an over-all boost of 10 to 15 per 
cent.
Skibo officials had hoped to hold 
prices at this summers level with 
the increased volume of sales 
making up for the rise in whole
sale prices. This plan was not 
successful because the rapid 
wholesale price rise overbalanced 
the savings from increased vol
ume.
Bread and milk wholesale prices
have increased 10 per cent in the 
last month, ice cream has gone up 
8 per cent, and meats have in
creased from 10 to 15 per cent. 
Other increases over the past year 
include: shortening, 60 per cent; 
butter, 25 per cent; and eggs, 90 
per cent.
Miss White emphasized the fact 
that Skibo is a part of the com
mons department that is run en
tirely as a non-profit organization. 
The commons department includes 
Skibo, Carnegie Inn, Mellon Hall, 
and Forbes Hall, each of which 
must cover its own bills.

Scotch & Soda Chooses George Woods Revue
Alumni Returning 
To Big Week-end
Angus McTavish III Will Welcome Graduates 
To Lehigh Game, Round of Parties and Dances
Welcomed by Angus McTavish III, the frisky Scotchman 
with a pedigree longer than his tail, Carnegie alumni clans 
will gather this week-end for the traditional homecoming fes
tivities.
A full weekend of events is planned with dinners and 
luncheons for the alumni, and parties, dinners, and dances by 
the fraternities both Friday and Saturday, a pep rally Friday 
night, football with Lehigh Saturday afternoon, and an all
school dance sponsored by Citcom Clan Saturday night.
Mr. John Elliot, Alumni secretary, will be in charge of 
alumni affairs. There will be class reunion dinners Friday night
* and a general luncheon Saturday 
noon in Skibo. When asked wheth
er the Alumni office was sponsor
ing any campaign this year, Mr.
The Ladys At Work, Directed by Carra, 
Will Open 1948 Spring Carnival Weekend
The Ladys at Work, a music
al revue by George Wood, playwriting drama student, is the 
choice of the Scotch and Soda club 
for their 1948 production.
Dave Crantz, chairman of the 
clubs executive board, announced 
the selection of Woods show at 
the Scotch and Soda Preview 
Party last Sunday afternoon in 
the Grill of the Carnegie Inn. Al
so announced was the return of 
Mr. Lawrence Carra of the drama 
faculty as director of the Scotch 
and Soda show for the second 
time.
The Ladys at Work is a mu
sical revue in two acts consisting 
of 28 scenes, with 25 musical 
numbers from the gay and subtle 
pen of George Wood. In the opin
ion of Crantz, the club has made 
a tep forward in its decision to 
produce the show. Said Crantz, 
Woods show rises above the us
ual rah-rah college musical.
Preparation of The Ladys at 
Work has already begun. Kenny

CIT Students Top Quota By 15% 
In Community Chest Fund Drive
Professor Norman Dawes, left, accepts red feather challenge from 
Scotty Turchison, architecture sub-senior, while R. E. Port eons, 
CIT News Service Editor, looks on.
The students of Carnegie Tech 
have not only met their Commu
nity Chest quota of $2,000, but 
have surpassed it by 15 per cent, 
stated Professor Norman H. 
Dawes, school chairman of the 
drive.
This is the largest per-student 
contribution and total solicitation 
ever collected at Carnegie. The 
administrative staff at CIT has 
donated $3,544.65, making the to
tal contributions 91 per cent of 
the goal of $6,500.
As a consequence of the stu
dents having done so well, Car
negie was awarded the official red 
feather at the report luncheon last 
Tuesday at the William Penn ho
tel. CIT was the only school in 
this area to receive the citation.
Professor Dawes, commenting 
on the successfully completed red 
feather drive, stated, An especial 
word of praise goes out to the en
gineering students, who went all 
out in contributing generously.

Students Can 
Obtain Free 
Chest X-Rays
Free chest X-rays will be of 
fered to all students of CIT from 
November 17 through November 
22, with use of this service being 
entirely voluntary.
The equipment will be set up 
on the stage of the mens gym. 
Since the unit can film three per
sons each minute, there >.111 be 
no waiting. The girls will be 
filmed as is, but the men will 
be requested to remove their coats 
and vests.
This work is carried on under 
the direction of Dr. Robert S. 
Easton of the U.S. Public Health 
Service. The Pittsburgh Junior 
Chamber of Commerce is sponsor
ing the X-ray program as a co
operative effort with the Pitts
burgh department of public health 
and the Tuberculosis League of 
Pittsburgh.
Dr. Eastons purpose is the 
diagnosis of pulmonary tubercu
losis, which is curable in its early 
stages. The findings of the X-rays 
are kept confidential, with each 
student being informed person
ally of results of his X-ray.
During the past week this same 
service was given at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh.
Elliot emphasized that the alumni 
are invited to home coming this 
year solely to have a good time.
A pep rally will be held in the 
bowl Friday night with a bonfire 
and the Kiltie Band providing the 
atmosphere to build up pre-game 
spirit for the Lehigh contest.
Mr. Clarence Overend, Director 
of Athletics, gives the Tartans 
an even chance for their first vic
tory in four years. Though he 
would have considered Lehigh too 
tough an opponent earlier in the 
season, Mr. Overend said the 
showing of the Tartans in recent 
games plus the reports of the 
scouts indicate a close fight.
As part of its homecoming pro
gram, Interfraternity Council 
will present an award to the fra
ternity having the best exterior 
decoration. The contest will be 
judged by Professor Schmertz of 
the department of architecture; 
Professor Readio, head of the 
painting and design department; 
and Professor Dawes of the de
partment of humanistic and so
cial studies.
The C-Hop will climax Satur
days activities as the last official 
event of Homecoming. The Citcom-sponsored all-school dance 
will be held in the gym with Bernie Armstrongs orchestra. There 
will be an admission charge of 
$2.00 per couple and three-fourths 
of the profits will go to the Kil
tie Band which is celebrating its 
twenty-fifth anniversary this year.

Editorial
Pinning Down 6Publicity
Define your terms!
When Dr. Max Sehoen, recently retired 
head of the department of psychology, was be
ing pursued too closely in an argument by an 
overambitious student bent on catching the 
uncatchable, he w^ould frequently use this 
phrase.
If the student altered his direction of at
tack to meet this thrust, he was almost imme
diately transported to the never-never land of 
semantics and higher philosophy, and there 
was struck from all directions so swiftly that 
a quick retirement to his seat was necessary 
if a glowing face were :to be prevented from 
burning up entirely.
As soon as the editorial of last wreek head
ed Definition of a Newspaper had been ex
amined by those directly concerned with it, 
we were asked until the question fairly rang 
in our ears, What do you mean by pub
licity! 
The Definition
Realizing that we were occupying a posi
tion roughly analagous to the one we once 
held in Dr. Schoens classes, and that an eager 
publicity manager or a determined school of
ficial could in a similar fashion crack the bar
riers which are now being set up against un
desirable material, we hasten to define our 
terms, relying for security on the relatively 
careful thought which can normally be given 
to editorial writing.
Publicity in the Tartan can be defined as 
material holding negligible interest for a high 
proportion of the student body when printed 
either as straight news or as a feature story.
Our definition of interest? Our method 
of determining a high proportion of the stu
dent body?
Both of these questions can usually be an
swered for generated propositions and always 
in pecific cases by the Tartan editorial board, 
which in composite has had a reasonable 
amount of experience with these problems.
Since space limitations prevent an enumera
tion of our criteria, we will use an example 
for further clarification.
An Illustrative Example
If an organization intends to hold a dance, 
then this intention and the plans which they 
have devised for its fulfillment with respect 
to time, place, price and availability of tickets, 
the name of the person in charge of the ar
rangements, and the reason for holding the 
dance all become news.
A sketch of the band and its leader, plus 
an elaboration, if pertinent, of the reasons for 
giving the dance would usually conclude the 
story. But a statement informing the reader 
that this particular dance will undoubtedly be 
byperb is editorial comment in a news story. 
And the unabridged activities list of the or
ganization's leaders is sheer publicity!
Carl Klahr
Says Who?
By Carl Klahr
The U. S. Department of State, engaged in a 
zealous campaign to wall in Russian Communism, 
is looking for a dignified way of cutting off its 
nose to spite its faceat least so far as Ger
many is concerned. A new poli
cy of rapprochement towards this 
nation, which we have fought 
twice in twenty years, is taking 
shape; a policy which is willing 
to let a series of deeds represent
ing the greatest crime of history
be mere bygones.
Well, you may say, the war 
ended almost three years ago. 
Are we going to hold it against 
them forever? Surely the Ger
man people have learned their 
lesson by this time. And if we 
can use them to spread our ideas in Europe, why 
not?
The reason not is simply this. Germany at pres
ent is just as flourishing a hotbed of Fascism and
Naziism as it ever was. The misery in the Ger
mans stomach has not convinced him of his guilt; 
instead it serves to intensify a political belief that 
thrives on hate, of which he has plenty.
Adolph Hitler is still the peoples hero. He is 
being deified in defeat as he would have been in 
victory. For instance, where do Germans go for their 
vacationthese poor caloriless Germans who have
nt the energy to mine coal when the coal is ship
ped to France as reparationswhere do they go 
for recreation? They go on tours of the Nazi 
Shrines, especially Hitlers various residences, there 
to mourn over Germanys fallen glory. And the 
State Department wants to bribe such people to 
spread American ideas.
I wonder how many Americans who enthusias
tically support the Marshall Plan realize that our 
German policy is subverting it, that their taxes are 
supporting the growth of a revitalized Germany. 
I wonder how many American manufacturers des
perate for more steel support the plans to send 
millions of tons of steel to rebuild German manu
facturing facilities.
Where have they gone, the plans to reduce 
Germanys war potential? Start every (German) 
plant, says ex-President Hoover, heavy as well 
as light, which can produce non-arms goods. This 
includes Germanys 12 million ton per year steel 
industry, and the I. G. Farben cartel, which during 
the war switched in a jiffy from making face 
powder to manufacturing gunpowder.
Cato the censor was criticized for ending every 
speech with, Carthage must be destroyed. Yet, 
due to his influence, Cartilage gave the Romans no 
more trouble. The United States State Department, 
on the other hand, is guided by the same policy it 
followed after World War I, of encouraging in
vestment in Germany. Eventually, you will recall, 
this did give us some trouble.
Letter To The Editor
Minetti Memorial Proposed
Editor, the Tartan:
It is almost a year since the Institute was 
last rendered with the enthusiasm and perfect 
timing that made it one of the best of all college 
cheers. It used to rock Pitt Stadium on its founda
tions; the Cathedral vibrated as the Institute 
slammed across Forbes field.
A1 Minetti was the originator and leader of the 
famous Tartan battle cry. A few hours after he 
led the Institute at the Case game last year his 
heart failed him. He had spent his last few hours 
giving his all for his beloved Tech. He hadnt miss
ed a football or basketball game since his under
graduate days in the Twenties. He symbolized the 
old Tech spirit which must be revived.
Here is a challenge for the department of sculp
ture. How about preparing a number of clay stat
uettes of A1 in his characteristic posein shirt 
sleeves, vest flapping open, arms extended, head 
thrown back calling for An Institute? These stat
uettes could be displayed and voted upon to pick 
the best likeness. This then would be used in con
junction with photographs to serve as the model 
for a full scale pattern to be cast in bronze. The 
statue would be set upon a pedestal on the campus 
between Fine Arts and Machinery Hall.
There was some discussion on this subject last 
year. Some organizations including Inter-Frater
nity had considered the financing problems, but 
too late in the spring to do anything definite.
Lets see some action from these organizations 
that want to improve the campus and the school 
spirit. The memories of A1 will be scattered away 
from the campus with the graduation of 1950. It 
is up to those of us in school now who have pride 
in Techs past and in Techs future.

Johnson Asks 
Another Cheer 
Investigation
Calls W&J Game Bad 
Cheerleading Example
Asking that chairman David 
Mintz of the School Spirit com
mittee conduct an investigation 
into the activities of the cheer
leaders at the W&J-Carnegie 
Tech game, councilman Jack 
Johnson gave new impetus to an 
old issue during the fourth meet
ing of Student Council, held on 
November 6 in the Union.
Johnson described the exhibi
tion as being one of the shoddiest 
examples of cheerleading I have 
ever seen at a school. Jack Se
ward added support to the charg
es, stating that he had been asked 
to bring the matter to the atten
tion of Council.
Questioning the completeness of 
Tartan coverage of Student Coun
cil meetings, Charles Duffett mov
ed that the newspaper be furnish
ed with a transcript of the week
ly minutes, thus requiring their 
publication, according to an inter
pretation of regulations made by 
president George Marshall. The 
motion was passed.
Marshall Hits Absences
Late in the meeting Marshall 
re-emphasized his policy concern
ing absences from and tardiness 
to meetings. Referring to Student 
Council as the most important 
single organization on campus, 
he stated that no other organiza
tion should take precedence in 
the matter of attendance.
If you think it is necessary to 
attend other meetings, he stated, 
then, very bluntly, you dont be
long on Student Council.
Marshall gave as reasons for 
excuses' death in the family, per
sonal illness, and regularly sched
uled school classes, with an ap
pearance after the beginning of 
the discussion of old business be
ing classed as an absence.
The problem of obtaining addi
tional funds for WCIT appeared 
once again as David Mintz moved 
that $250 in the Student Council 
social budget be allocated to the 
campus radio station.
He withdrew the motion later, 
however, in order to make that 
amount available towards pay
ment of CITs dues to the Nation
al Student Association. The NSA 
received Councils permission to 
hold its Western Pennsylvania 
Sub-Regional Conference here on 
November 22 on a motion by Nor 
man Larsen.
Cheerleading Details Withheld
An attempt was made by Sema 
Moskowitz to obtain the full de
tails of the W&J cheerleading in
cident, but she was blocked in 
this effort by President Marshall, 
who requested that Mintzs com
mittee make a full report on the 
incident at the next Council meet
ing.
Charles Duffet, however, had 
more success than did Miss Mos
kowitz. After beginning, I dont 
want to infringe on the freedom 
of the Tartan . . he asked 
that the newspaper publish the 
Council minutes.

Scenes From The Military BallLee Watkins Re-elected 
Beaux Arts President
Balinesian Ball Planned For February 27;
Fine Arts Building Will Be Redecorated
The Beaux Arts society, after learning that its controversial 
budget had been approved for the coming year, held its second 
meeting last Monday in Fine Arts.
Election of officers was first on the agenda, and Lee Kirk Wat

Scabbard and Blades Military Ball, held in the Schenley ball 
room, on Saturday night, was the first formal dance of the year. 
Flags decorated the hall while the varied uniforms of the men added 
to the martial spirit. Baron Elliots band provided smooth music 
for the evening.
The ROTC honorary held its tapping ceremony during inter
mission, and the dates of the pledges had the honor of giving them 
their ribbons.

sentiment was in favor of retain
ing February 27, the first Friday 
after the between-semesters break, 
as the date for the affair.
The theme of the dance, which 
was agreed upon unanimously, 
will be that of a Balinesian Ball. 
Plans for elaborate decorations 
have already been drawn up.
The first two floors of Fine Arts 
will be completely disguised, and 
any semblance of unfriendly-dull 
walls will disappear. A huge 
Balinesian temple and a shrine 
are to be constructed, with all of 
their intricacies and color repro
duced. The remainder of the dec

Heiland Gives Best Running And Kicking Exhibition of Season;
CIT Is Ahead At Half But Case Outplays Skibos In Last Part To Win
By Pete Cregut
Cleveland, Ohio, Nov. 8Al
though they were rated a chance 
to win for the first time this year, 
the Carnegie Tech Tartans were 
outplayed in the last quarter of 
todays game and went down to 
defeat before a heavier Case elev
en by a score of 19-14.
At nearly full strength for the 
first time this year, the Skibos 
gave all indications that they 
were going to win their first game 
in 14 starts as they walked off 
the field at the half leading the 
Clevelanders 14-7.
But before the game was over, 
Case had closed the gap, gone 
ahead on a touchdown set up by 
a questionable interference pen
alty and won their first game 
since trampling the Tartans last 
year 24-0.
The game was marked by the 
return to the lineup of Jerry 
Helland, Mount Lebanon quarter
back who had dislocated his el
bow on the third play of the West 
Virginia Wesleyan game and seen 
only kicking duty in the W & J 
game.
Jerry showed that he could have 
made a great difference in the 
last three games by giving the 
best exhibition of running and 
kicking that has been seen by 
Carnegie rooters this year. He was 
helped by the return of little Augie DiGiovanni who made his first 
appearance of the season.
The game started in a snow 
flurry as Case kicked off to Car
negie, and when the Tartans 
couldnt move the ball in two 
tries Helland kicked to the Car
negie 40. Case took over and 
three plays later Frank Gerace, 
star of last years Case victory, 
broke over his own left tackle and 
raced 32 yards for a touchdown. 
The kick for the extra point was 
good and Case led 7-0.
Case then kicked off, and on 
the second play Helland connect
ed with a jump pass to end Bob 
Dougherty for 20 yards and - a 
first down. But Case held and 
Helland kicked out of bounds on 
the Case 32. The Clevelanders 
moved up the field to the Car
negie 34 where they fumbled and 
John Windish recovered.
The Tartans then started on a 
64 yard march for their first 
touchdown. Helland ran the ball 
for two successive first downs, but 
was hurt on the next play and 
had to be removed from the game. 
Maley took over his quarterback 
job, and after running plays by 
DiGiovanni and Maley, the quar
terback completed two passes to 
Williamson, the second good for 
a touchdown. Premo Pappafava

Six teams are still battling it 
it for the campus touch football 
lampionship.
In the National League its 
Theta Xi and Phi Kappa, both un
beaten. Citcom and Kappa Sigma 
are undefeated in the American 
League while Sigma Nu and the 
Tau Delts are all knotted up in 
the Federal League.
After a very rainy Monday, 
ings got under way when the 
ou Delts made it three in a 
by beating the Delts 17 to 
. The Lieberman to Marv Stein 
nbination clicked for two touchiowns, and a Leiberman to Grossjerg pass was good for another 
five pointer. Yorkin tabbed a Delt 
l the end-zone for the final two 
>oints for Tau Delta Phi. The 
>ne Delt tally came on a pass, 
./ahrenburg to Jay Johnson.
The Delts took an easy one from 
lie Married Vets 16-0 on Thursay. The Sigma Nus and Tau 
Its met Friday in the game 
lat was to decide the Federal 
eague championship and fought 
' an 11-11 tie. The Tau Delts 
arted fast and scored twice on 
Cohen to Yorkin passes before 
Sigma Nu dented the scoring colann. The second half was the reerse of the first as Katselas and 
eich hit pay dirt for Sigma Nu. 
both teams scored a first down, 
and despite the arguments at the 
end of the game the score remain
ed tied at 11 each.
In the National League the 
7s took their third and fourth 
straight wins, defeating the Beta 
3igs 20-11 and the Graduate 
Physicists 27-0. The Phi Kaps 
stayed in the running by taking 
a close one from the PiKAs 16- 
2, although this one is under 
orotest.
The ATOs hit their winning 
tride by taking an easy one from
the Beta Sigs 22-12. Bob Schier 
tossed four touchdown passes, 
two of them to Ashbee and one 
each to Larsen and Cywinski. Both 
Beta Sig tallies came on passes 
from Levy to Corwin.
There were only three gamei 
in the American League this week
with Citcom and Kappa Sigma 
still tied for the lead. The 
Sigma victory on Wednesday was 
over the D.U.s by a score of 7-6. 
Budden passed to Anderson for 
the Kappa Sig tally.
Citcom also remained unde
feated by pinning down the Dorm 
Combine 14-3. Bill Glunt passed 
to Mat Biss for Citcoms first 
score while Mackey threw an 
aerial to Muckey for the second 
tally.
In the other game FPHA beat 
Beta Theta Pi 7-3. The lone touch
down came after a pass intercep
tion by Bruce Schmid of FPHA.

Soccer Team Ties Thiel, 2-2; 
Loses 1-0 Tilt To Allegheny
The two away soccer contests 
in which the Skibo booters were 
engaged last week ended in a 
tie and a loss respectively. The 
first was a 2-2 tie at Thiel, and the 
second, a close 1-0 defeat at the 
hands of Allegheny.
The score of the Thiel game is 
very deceiving, for it doesnt in
dicate the one-sidedness of the 
match. It was truly a mud battle; 
nevertheless, our boys outmaneuvered their opponents during 
every minute of the four quarters. 
During the first quarter alone, the 
Skibos had more than 20 shots at 
the Thiel goal, only to be warded 
off by fine goal tending and Lady 
Luck. Finally in the second quar
ter, A1 Gelbin scored from 20 
yards out for the initial tally. 
Thiel was not to be outdone and 
tied up the contest on one of their
infrequent offensive rushes. Jack 
Burrey made the score 2-1, Car
negie, when he pushed both ball 
and goalie over the opponents 
goal line. The game was evened 
at 2-2 one minute before the final 
whistle. The Skibos requested a 
playoff of the tie, but Thiel re
fused, being very well pleased 
with the final score.
On Saturday, November, our 
boys traveled to Allegheny. It was 
a cold, brisk day and the playing 
field was covered with snow. Ac
tion was fast and furious. The 
home team decided the contest in 
a hurry when they scored the lone 
tally on a screen shot from 10 
yards out after five minutes of 
play. In fact, Allegheny dominated 
play during the first half, with the 
Skibos hard pressed on the de
fensive.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Tartans Lose
Tackles Norm Keats and Gerry Meyers 
* * #
Keats and Meyers Are 
Two Large Characters9
Every good football line has as 
its foundation two masses of hu
manity who play, respectively, 
left and right tackle. Carnegies 
line coaches Irwin and McMillan 
have stationed two large charac
ters, Gerry Meyers and Norm 
Keats, at these vital positions.
These boys, having shown much 
improvement in their play over 
last year, both credit the change 
to the fact that this season the en
tire squad has been worked hard 
and is in good physical condition. 
Meyers Transfers to CIT
Last season Gerry transferred 
to Carnegie from Canisius college 
where he held down a tackle posi
tion on the football team. After 
entering CIT his bulldog style of 
play soon earned him the first 
string right tackle berth and the 
title of Brute.
Gerry belongs to the hit em 
hard and vicious school. Oppos
ing linemen are the first to give 
him credit after a game. Off the 
field he is a quiet, studious boy, 
as his 3.4 factor attests.
Meyers carries 210 pounds of 
muscle on a 62 frame. Having 
always been substantially built, 
he started his football career 
early, playing three years of 
tackle at Bennett high school in 
Buffalo.
Varsity club and secretary of 
Dorm Council.
Over at left tackle is 24 year 
old Norm Keats who is larger 
than Meyers by ten pounds. His 
system consists of running over 
opposing linemen after bumping 
them around for a few plays.
Norm entered Carnegie as a 
production major in the drama 
department after being discharged 
from the Army Air Corps in 1946. 
He is now a sophomore with two 
years of football eligibility re
maining.
Keats is Brooklyn born and 
Brooklyn raised. While at New 
Utretcht high school he played 
fullback for three years, so for a 
time this season Coach Donohoe 
experimented with Norm as a 
blocking back, but later found 
him to be more valuable at 
tackle.
Keats, Big Fraternity Man
After football season last year 
Norm managed to squeeze in time 
for the Rock n Riot show. The 
Varsity club, Scotch and Soda 
club, and Tau Delta Phi frater
nity constitute the remainder of 
his extracurricular activities.
Keats and Meyers have been 
rocks of granite in the Tartan 
forward wall. The usual schedule 
calls for both to play almost the 
entire 60 minutes of each game. If 
these men continue to bounce op
posing players around as they 
have recently, the Tartans should 
soon have a few victories.
[Continued from page 4] 
split the uprights with a kick to 
the game at 7-7.
an exchange of kicks, C. 
Groomes recovered a Case 
on the Carnegie 36 yard 
line. Runs by Helland and Ditwo jump passes 
to Dougherty 
brought the ball to the Case 6 
where DiGiovanni ran left end to 
the 1 yard line and a first down. 
Then with only 25 seconds re
maining in the half, Helland dove 
over a mass of bodies for the 
touchdown and Pappafava added 
extra point to put the Skibos 
ahead 14-7.
On the first play of the second 
half Frank Gerace raced 58 yards 
to the Carnegie 11 yard line, but 
the Tartans pushed Case back to 
the 25 and took over.
After an exchange of punts, 
Zahn of Case broke away to the 
Tartan 36. On the next play Ger
ace bullied his way 36 yards to 
the goal. Everett missed the con
version and Tech still led 14-13.
The Tartans started rolling af
ter receiving the Case kick-off, 
going all the way to the Case 4 
before Maley overshot William
son on a fourth down pass.
Shortly afterwards the disputed 
interference play which set up the 
winning touchdown occurred.
Case had the ball on its own 43
yard line when they threw a long 
third down pass which went over 
the head of the intended receiver. 
It appeared, from our vantage 
point, that Warner, who was cov
ering the intended receiver, veer
ed over away from the ball and 
slowed down directly in front of 
the Case man. He bumped into 
Warner and then fell on the 
ground.
The official who was covering 
the play did not call it but an
other official who was on the oth
er side of the field claimed that 
interference had been committed 
and gave Case the ball on the 
Tech 30. Then Gerace took the 
ball over for the winning touch
down. Had the interference not 
been called, Case would have had 
to kick on the next down and 
probably would not have had an
other scoring opportunity for the 
remainder of the afternoon.

Tech varsity swimming team

We beg everybodys pardon for constantly talking about words

Council Plans Next Evening Student Dance 
For November 29; Music By Tommy Carlyn
The monthly meeting of the Evening Student Council was held 
on Sunday, November 2. President Mihelic opened the meeting 
with the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting.
One of the items discussed at the October meeting was the ad
dition of new representatives to council from the various schools.
* There are several openings to be 
filled by students from Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College and 
School of Fine Arts. Students are
who sold papers until the small 
hours of the morning day in and 
day out. How he slept the re
quired amount of time for a child 
and still arose for school is a 
puzzle to us. But maybe he went 
to school only occasionally.
A teacher tells us that one of 
her pupils would learn easily if 
he would come to school at least 
a few days out of each week. The 
kid, if he does awaken, awakens 
himself and then gets breakfast as 
only an eight-year old can while 
his mother lies in bed.
When asked what France need

answered, Good mothers. In 
spite of all his coldness and brutSlity, he had something there 
that America has lost sight of.
Another kid we know of was 
regaling his little (and big) 
friends with descriptions of the 
party they were going to have at 
his home that night in honor of 
his brother. Thinking that the 
brother was returning from the 
service, an adult listener naively 
asked whether the brother was in 
the Army or the Navy. This 
answer floored us: Hes cornin 
home from jail.
All children are essentially 
O.K., as anyone with a little un
derstanding will agree. Heels are 
to be found only among the adults. 
We wish the guys who coin 
phrase^ would make a new die 
for the juvenile delinquency 
one.

Todays hand illustrates a very 
important principle which is too 
often neglected by most bridge 
players. The North-South pair 
above arrived at a slam contract 
which could not be made because 
they had too many trumps.
Mass of Misinformation
The bidding is a mass of misin
formation. Souths jump to three 
spades is overoptimistic to say 
the least. A jump in partners suit 
is reserved for a hand which con
tains an opening in that suit. A 
bare two and one-half honor count 
does not constitute an opening bid. 
South then proceeded to make 
matters worse by encouraging 
Norths slam try instead of sign
ing off with four spades. Further
more, South was very foolish to 
hide the fact that he held a good 
four card suit of his own, par
ticularly a four card major suit.
North went to Blackwood be
cause he heard it was the thing 
to do, and as a result of all this, 
wound up in a contract which has 
absolutely no chance to succeed. 
As is obvious they must lose a 
club and a diamond for a one 
trick set. Now observe how 
smoothly North-South can arrive 
at makeable slam by correct bid
ding.

Six Hearts Easily Made
Six hearts is easily made as 
Souths second diamond is dis
carded on Norths fifth spade, and 
Norths losing diamond is ruffed 
by South. In other words, declarer 
counts four trumps in dummy, five 
spades, one ruff in the closed hand, 
and the two aces for a total of 
twelve tricks.
If there are two available trump 
suits, one split four-four and the 
other five-three or five-four, it is 
generally true that the suit divid
ed four-four as trump will pro
duce more than the other com
binations because the longer suit 
has the value of providing dis
cards, which value it loses if it 
is made trump. Thus even when a 
very strong trump suit is found, it 
often pays to investigate the pos
sibility of the existence of another 
suit divided four-four.
Red Cross Needs 
Blood Donations
Because only 75 per cent of the 
needed number of blood donors 
volunteered, the Veterans hos
pital in Aspinwall has been forc
ed to postpone many scheduled 
operations and treatments.
Although there is still a large 
demand for blood, the number of 
volunteers has decreased greatly 
since the end of the war. Many 
people have failed to keep their 
appointments, thus further com
plicating the work of the Red 
Cross Blood Donor service.
An appeal has been made to all 
the students of Carnegie Tech to 
help meet the present quota. The 
Blood bank is open on Thursday 
afternoons from 1:30 until 5:00.
