Other Y projects include the formation of a committee to assist and entertain foreign students, the organization of a group for former Hi-Y men, Thanksgiving and Christmas vacation plans, and the installation of radios, free, in hospital rooms. If any students know hospital patients who desire radios in their rooms, they are asked to notify the Y office.Already hundreds of freshmen have taken part in the Y. M. C.

By MARGARET GRIFFIN
Walter Lippmann, prominent newspaper columnist and analyst of world affairs, recently delivered at Columbia University, a paper concerning The Scholar in a Troubled World. The address, which has been reprinted in the August Atlantic, presents, on a student level, the elevated opinions of the author.
Although every student is not necessarily a scholar, every member of a college or university is aware of his status as an intelligent individual among a world of ignorant or indifferent humans.The scholar, says Lippmann, 'feels that he ought to be doing 
something about the worlds troubles, or at least to be saying something which will help others to do something about them. The 
world needs ideashow can he sit silently in his study and with a good conscience go on with his thinking when there is so much that urgently needs to be done? However, at the same time he hears his scholars conscience which tells him that as a scholar he must remain indifferent to the immediate, and serenely attached to the processes of inquiry and understanding.If the scholar remains aloof from affairs, the public asks im
patiently what is all this theorizing good for anyway if it does not show a way out of all the trouble. In participation in public affairs the scholar suffers in his 
own estimation as weU in that of I
othersHe dislikes himself he pronounces conclusions that he only half believes; he distrust.3 himself and the .scholars life, because, when the practical need for knowledge is so great, all the libraries leave so much unsettled. 
This mental conflict between participation and detachment possesses every student of economics and of politics, of law, of 
education and of morals. It is demanded of him that he provide the solutions. It is assumed that 
prolonged study should have produced immediate practical wisdom; that from the professors should issue knowledge of how to decide the current controversies/ 
Mr. Lippmann discusses this presumption:
We assume that a profound study of politics ought to produce a statesman, a profound study of 
economics ought to produce a man of affairs, a profound study of law 
ought to produce a legislator Yet we know that it rarely happens. Nevertheless, we continue to assume and expect, and then are disappointed when the scholar 
is ineffective in affairs, or halfhearted and distracted in his search for truth.According to Lippmann the intrinsic reason for the failure of theory in managing public affairs lies in the will of the people. Practical decisions depend largely upon swift appraisal of public opinion, but there is as yet no science which controls this ap(Continued on Page Four.)

Association-Formal, and has featured at other large college social affairs.One of the special arrangements Billy Weixel features is his own interpretation of Shine and peo
ple who have danced to his music testify that his rendering of Goofus will double the dancers over with laughter. Aside from these 
two special numbers, he has sever
al other ludicrous novelty arrangements.Special arrangements have been made to broadcast the music from the dance over Station WWSW.

Y.W.C.A. Tea Is 
Held Tomorrow
The annual Big and Little Sister Tea will be held tomorrow from 4 to 6 oclock in Recreation Hall, on the fourth floor of Margaret Morrison College. Each year the Y. W. C.

A. president, will preside. Miss Patterson, who is succeeding Miss Green as active sponsor, will also be present.
Each big sister will attend the tea with her little sister, but the Y. W. C. A. Cabinet urges all fresh

The Carnegie Puppet intends to continue its broadcasting over Station WWSW every 
Thursday evening at 7:45 p. m. 
presenting a program of music and sketches. Next week the broadcast will be one-half hour long instead of fifteen minutes as it was last Thursday. As the talent heard during this presen

The Coal Research Laboratory 
in Engineering Hall has recently in

working on twelve major projects.
The latest appointments to the 
staff are three Fellows, Dr. A. R. Al

both of whom received their their 
Ph. D. from German Universities, 
and the third, Philip H. Dewey, 
graduate student with his masters 
degree. At the present time, thir
teen members of the staff aro technical men directly engaged in ex
perimental study.The physical equipment added to 
the laboratories includes the Installation of hoods and both AC and 
DC power. The machine shop has been, increased in size and equip
ment so that its usefulness is considerably greater. During the sum
mer three additional laboratories were installed and equipped to permit further expansion of work and to take care of the newly appointed men. As a result, the Coal Research Laboratory now has thirteen well equipped laboratories and a machine shop at its disposal.
Work is now in progress on twelve problems, all but two of which are directly related to the study of the mechanism of thermal 
decomposition of coal. The actual number of experimental investigations is greater, since many of 
these problems include more than one phase of study.

Predictions that Carnegies en

have been borne out, an examina

(-
Alan Bright, Registrar, pointed .out that This is a normal enrollment. Even in formr times, the fluctuation from year to year and from semester to semester has fm-\ quently been greater than this.' It is a wonderful tribute to the Administration and to the student body.
The decrease of 175) in total enrollment has been distrlbutelli, through all the colleges, making for slight reductions In all but the College of Engineering.This years reduction represents an even smaller natural reduction since several short coursos, offered last year, have been dropped tills semester.

By patient labor she helps him to gain success and riches. Wang Lung tires*, qf her stolid plainness and thrusts her into second place by marrying the frail and beautiful Lotus. The plays ends fragically when the death of O-lan awakens the dormant love of Wang Lung.Outstanding in the cast of about forty are Alla Nazimova as O-lan, Henry Travers as Wangs father,- and Sidney Greenstreet as Wangs crafty uncle.
Can Betty Co-Ed Eat All Desserts 
And Retain Her Girlish Figure?
Which shall it beher pride or 
her purse? That is the vital ques
tion confronting Betty Co-ed today. 
And what with the tempting food 
values offered in the campus cafeterias this year, the question really 
warrants serious consideration.Last year, for instance, with sand
wiches alone costing as much as 20 cents or 25 cents. It was only by 
discreet apportionment of funds that Bettys weekly allowance provided for sundaes or devil food 
cake and ice cream on her luncheon tray. Day after day she lunched 
frugally on a meagre sandwich and plain ice cream or cake. She thus incurred no undue expense to her purse or her girlish figure, this year, however, the gods of the Grille, the Beanery, and Skibo have taken pity on the budgeted co-eds; 
the same-priced sandwich comes accompanied by a generous handful | ditures.
of crisp potato chips, or steaming snowflake potatoes, or even a choice of beverages.
Now our Betty is in a dilemma; she is forced to make a sacrifice somewhere. What to dowhat to dofor to be penny wise may bo 
pound foolish. The calorie-carrying dosserts which budgeting excluded may now become a dally delicacy, which will be disastrous 
to the highly coveted HllmncBH which frugal lunches assured. It would take a much more willful 
woman than Miss Botty to resist the tasty and altogether delicious lunch bargains that are offered daily and yet, there is the cute little size 14 dress that is also a bargain and that shows plenty of 
taste besides. It is a weighty problem. this, for Betty Co-ed is just 
as proud of her pocket-size figure she is of her pocket-wise expen---------------------------------------------------

Here November 12W.-Virginia.. .There November ISPitt......................HereThough the freshman team is not yet in appearance, an attractive schedule, consisting of four meets, is already planned. Since good material is often withheld by hesitancy or'disinterest in cross country running, a plea is made that all possible running material, varsity and freshman, be out for the tryouts at the earliest date possible.
WHEW1 WAS THAT A CLOSE ONE? Almost every one breathed a sigh of relief when the gun sounded ending that hectic struggle with Geneva, although I imagine most every one would like to have seen the game last a minute or so longer to see what the Tartans could have done with the ball when they had it on or near the 10- yard stripe. However, true to the pre-game dope, Howard Harpsters Geneva Covenanters came down to the stadium and put up the toughest opening game battle that the Tartans have had to play in years. The Tartans had to put forth all the power they had in their command to eke out that 7-0 victory. There can be no doubt about it that Harpys boys put up a great fight, and on several occasions the Covenanters had the Plaid with their backs to the wall, but from each of these the Tartans were able to emerge without their goal line crossed, and thus emerged victorious in the first game of the year. Anyhow Im glad I didnt take any of those 14 point bets which looked so good a day or two before the game 'cause now I can eat this week where otherwise I might have had to join the well-known Pittsburgh 
Bread Line.
IT IS HARD TO SAY JUST WHAT ONE THINKS OF THE TARTAN 1932 GRID MACHINE. They seem to be better or more powerful than last year's squad but hardly up to the form displayed by the 1930 outfit, which scored an overwhelming victory over Thiel in the opening game and made a Rambling Wreck of Georgia Tech in the second 
game. Individually they are almost as good, but team work seems to be lacking, especially on the offense. We do not want to discount the fact that Geneva put up a stubborn defense, but surely something was lacking. What was wrong? Ill admit that I do not know much nbout football but it seems to me that a few good lessons in fundaontals would not do a bit of harm. A little practice inlet us say locking and taking out would be tacklers. Several times a ball career would have been free to go places if his interference could have clipped out ambitious Geneva tacklers, but more often than not the pigskin toter was slowed un -o :n  iiac ue v. ^o ..or stumbled over his own interference.
MANY INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCES WERE EXCELLENT. The line played a bang-up game defensively. It was seldom that Geneva could break through for any sizable gains. Before our friends, the downtown scribes, get together and decide which of Pitts linemen they are going to ballyhoo to the great All-American berths let us say that our Co-Captain Hooks Sample will ask no quarter from any of them. Hooks was right in there every moment. Not only did he stop many plays at the line but he was down under punts very fast and several times got the receiver before he had time to move. The ends were especially good in this department, as is witnessed by the fact that Art Grahame, a clever runner, seldom returned a ball as far as 10 yards. The failure of the much-praised passing attack of Genevas to function was mainly due to the fast work of tackles Foresman and Croft, who rushed the passer so quickly that many of the intended passes were broken up before they started.
TO BILL SPISAK, BLOND MIDLAND YOUTH, AND FORMER KISKI STAR, goes the credit of being the biggest ground gainer in the Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Ho was held out of the opening .lineup in favor of the more experienced Sayles, but after his appearance in the game he served warning to future opponents that they had ( better watch out for him or they will be looking at his heels most of i the afternoon. Bill was not injected into the lineup until after the 'second quarter had begun, but on three consecutive plays he gained a total of 54 yards. During the course of the afternoon he turned in runs of 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 23 and 25 yards. In 22 attempts he gained a total of 171 yards or an average of 7.8 yards for each attempt. All of which is not bad for a beginner in his first varsity football game. CoCaptain George Kavel chalked up the largest single gain of the game. George snared one of Grahames well meant passes and tore down the field for a jaunt of 33 yards, and he almost made a touchdown on the play. George was his usual consistent self, scoring the first touchdown and gaining yards when they were needed most.
CARNEGIE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING THE ACTIONS OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM in Its games away from home will be glad to hear that the Athletic Council has made plans to run a private telegraph wire to the scene of each game on the road. Play by play returns will come' right to our gymnasium from each of these games. The play by play accounts of the game wjll be announced by megaphone and the games will probably be reproduced on the big Grld-Graph. Students will be admitted on their student books and outsiders will be charged 25 cents.

arpsters Covenanters 
Fight Hard Against 
Tartan Team
The big Red machine of Carnegie 
and the little blue engine from Geneva met head-on in the Stadium Saturday and. when the smoke had cleared away the Covenanters found themselves bumped off the track with a 7-0 damage suit against them. The scrappy, well-coaclied visiting gladiators repeatedly tossed the proverbial monkey wrench into the Scotch works and battled with 
the Plaid on even terms most of the 
way.Instead of being a warm-up game the Geneva contest proved to be 
one of the most difficult inaugural affairs ever undertaken by the Sklhos. Praise in large portions is due Harpster for the intelligent, courageous team he sent against Car
negie.Defensively the Tartans showed great potentialities and served no
tice to future opponents that they are going to be a hard team to score on. The Plaid offense, however, to put it mildly, still has a few rough edges which need to be 
polished off. The Sldbos greatest difficulty in their opening game seemed to be the inability to get 
their ball carriers past the line of 
scrimmage.Little Bill Spisalc, playing his 
first varsity game for Carnegie, acquitted himself nobly and showed the rooters some tricky, brokenfteld performances. Co-Captains Sample and Kavel displayed the wares which gained them their 
leadership and were greatly instrumental in smothering the Grahame and Aultman passing combine. The Tartan linemen, lead by Sample, rushed Grahames passing and kicking while the Plaid backs successfully covered the Geneva receivers.Fumbles and penalties marred 
the greater part of the game and kept the teams out of the scoring zones during the first 30 minutes of play. In the second half the Carnegie offense began to click and after a preliminary exchange of 
punts the Tartans' marched 40 yards for their only score. Spisak bore the brunt of this successful advance with Kavel scoring the touchdown. Geneva threatened twice thereafter but both times Carnegie smothered 
the Covenanter attempts and the game ended with Tech in possession of the ball on the Geneva 12- 
yard line.________________________

Veteran Red Cat Team 
To Face Carnegie 
In Cleveland
A strong, veteran Western Reserve football team, fresh from an impressive 6-0 victory over Dennison, waits in its Cleveland lair 
for the invasion of Carnegie this Saturday. The Red Cats, with 10 lettermen returning and augmented by a great array of sophomore ma
terial, appears to be the best outfit Reserve followers have seen on the field for many years.The coming game is the fourth played between the two schools 
with the first three verdicts going to the Skibos. Football relations with Western Reserve began in 1927 when Carnegie took a 45-0 victory. No game was played in 1928 but the 
following year the Tartans trimmed Reserve 33-6. The last meeting be
tween the schools in 30 went to the Plaid, 40-8.Tom Keady, who formerly coached 
at Lehigh when that institution turned out championship teams, has started his second season at the Reserve helm. Keady has two able 
assistants in Jiggs Donahoue and George Brown, and the trio have developed a smooth-running aggre
gation to face Carnegie.The present Red Cat team is built around three veterans, Eddie Finnigan, a stellar halfback; Doc Ulrich, signal barker, and Christman, a par-excellent lineman. Other lettermen returning include Troyan at end; Cornsweet and Cobbs, tackles, and Mattoe, Franz and Wayne In 
the backfleld.Keadys big difficulty will be replacing White and Webster, his two star terminals who graduated last year. The veteran Christman will 
have Willison as a running mate at tackle while Colvin is a likely starter at center. Barron Keady, 
the coach's son and a good punter and dropkicker, is also a backfleld 
candidate.As Western Reserve uses the 
Warner system, the game should enable Carnegie's new men to become further accustomed to the style of play employed by Pitt and 
other future opponents.___________
Skibo Plebes 
Op en Season 
With Panthers
Thus far this fall the Skibo mentors have been very reticent on the Plebe football situation, but when the opening whistle sounds fans may expect the usual powerful machine.
The Plebes cause received a severe jolt last week, however, when 
Bowser, a very classy back, dislocated a shoulder, putting him out for the remainder of the season. Coach Armentrout is banking heavily on Spisak, younger brother of Bill Spisak, star varsity halfback. The junior member of the family 
has shown great promise in early scrimmages. Spencer at center and Moore at tackle are likewise being depended upon for high-class work. 
The schedule follows:
October 15Pitt..........................HereOctober 22W. Va.....................AwayOctober 29Kislci......................AwayNovember 25W. & J..................Here
Armentrout, New Coacli, 
To Present Strong 
Squad In Opener
Coach Big Dog Armentrout, 
who football fans will remember as 
last years field general and a great 
halfback for the Carnegie board of' 
strategy, has only 10 days in which 
to round his promising plebe squad 
into shape for their first aud hard
est engagement of the season. The 
Tartan yearlings clash with the 
Panther Cubs from across the park 
on October 15 and. as usual, the ful
ls expected to fly thick and fast.
For two years now these games 
between the freshman squads of 
Pittsburghs major institutions have 
endod in scoreless deadlocks with 
little to choose between them. In 
1930 the Tartans wore robbed of victory by the whistle for the half, although during the remainder of the game the Panthers seemed to have the edge offensively. Last year, paradoxically enough, the Plaid apparently had the situation well in hand when Pitt collected a fumble for a first down on the eightyard stripe, only to bo stopped by 
the familiar foghorn. _______

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1932
Carnegie Plaid 
Night Schools 
Page, Changed
New Outward Appearance 
Changes Page Though 
Purpose Is Same
Tlie first 'issue of The Tartan 
this year appeared in an entirely 
new style and setup. The whole 
paper from the first page to the 
last one has undergone a complete 
change. The Plaid is heartily in 
accord with these changes and is 
glad to cooperate in every way to 
make the college weekly a pro
gressive publication of our campus.
The main features of the paper 
have been maintained, that is, 
page two will be the sports page 
with the Plaid Sports Screen 
spotted in the left-hand corner; 
page three will remain the Plaid 
Page with the Idle Thoughts of an 
Idle Night Student serving as the 
spot for this page, and "From the 
Fence will remain on page four 
with its chatter about everything 
in general. By this arrangement 
the paper becomes a complete unit 
but without sacrificing any indi
viduality of the various component 
sections.
No doubt the first glance at the 
paper gives one the impression that 
it is not the campus weekly but 
some city daily newspaper delivered by mistake. One has to rub his eyes to realize that it really is The Tartan appearing in its new dress and what a dress it is. The whole change makes a wonderful stride in college journalism and places The Tartan among the foremost of campus publications.The whole typography of the paper is on a vei*y high plane and shows that a great deal of thought and work has been expended to achieve the results attained. The impressions of the type are clear and distinct, the paper in general is clear-cut and thereby much easier read. A complete system of heads has been adopted and uniformity will exist throughout all the pages.The elimination of the old familiar banner The Carnegie Plaid does not mean that this section will disappear from The Tartan. We will still have this page and the news appearing on it will be just as pertinent to our group as ever. It is just a progressive move as our page is read by all the Carnegie students, and why shouldnt it?The night student body ,and the day student body have common interests and during the past several years these groups have been drawing closer and closer together. No logical reason can be advanced why the two groups should be entirely separate and distinct from each other. It is true that there can never be a complete merging 
of these bodies, for each one lives in a sphere entirely its own, but in a broad sense both are Carnegie Tech students. The same courses taught by the same instructors are offered to each and the credit earned lias the same value, for this reason we find many day students registered for night classes. Certain progressive individuals have seen the desirability of working hand-in-hand with one another for the better understanding of mutual interests with the result that the Carnegie student, be he a da.y or night man, will be better served.
The dropping of the banner at the iop of our page is therefore just another highly significant and important step in this direction. News items that are of importance to the night student are of more than passing interest to the day student, and the opposite is also true for there is not a single night student who has ever received The Tartan who has not read it from the front page to the last page.

Well, Im just like everybody 
else -around here, the summer's 
gone, fall is here, school is about 
ready to open, and Im still lookin 
for money to use for tuition and 
books, 'nd things. It was a pretty 
good summer considerin every
thing. Swimmin was about as good as any other year, there were a lot of fellows around who had time to pitch horse shoes, and of course there were a few trips to the farms here and there to see some of the folks.But, doggone it anyway, nothin goes just right. When Ive got a lotta time, I dont have much money to have a good time and when Ive got the money, Im so darn busy that I don't have time 
to have some fun. Ah me! guess theres no use in kicldng. Why, iust the other day I met a friend from the town below and he sez, Well, Bill, how you doin these days? Not bad I replied. Youre eatin aint you? he asks, and its your own, well what are you kickin about anyway?That's just it, if we all can hold our heads up by ourselves we shouldnt go around crying about the way things were before. Of course, there is no disgrace when folks need a little help in order to get by. It seems to me if people didnt offer help to their neighbors and friends the stuff they preach in the little white church down on Main street wouldnt hold for much. If theres anything in this religion stuff then I guess there always has been someone who needed a little shovin over the rough spots in the road.What most of us need right now is just a little friendly boost of a few dollars to get us started right 
and for the new comers a little advice on how to pass those darn math quizzes and how to unscramble those chemistry symbols. We all need a good start for the year 
and after weve about sized up our years work, then we can* sit back and maybe have a smoker and a dance or two and get together on Saturday nights so we can give the boys a chance to see our new girl.
THAT many former night students can hardly wait until registration night so that they can get back into the harness.THAT the query, Are you going back to school? brings various responses, but the most frequent answer given is: Sure, if I can find the money.THAT even though a drop in night registration is to be expected, we bet it wont lie as much as some are inclined to think.THAT, if fasting serves Gandhi to good advantage, some of us might try it to end the present economic recession. It might work, and how.THAT, with the elephant and the donkey trying to kick each other to death, this is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.THAT by this time Dad Manson is hard at work studying the question and answer book before the onrush of night students begins.THAT, in spite of the We point with pride, statements of certain political orators, others are claiming that this country has gone to the bow-wows. We should worry, for the whole world has been going there since the first man and his loud speaker had their initial monologue.THAT a premature visit to the campus by your restless scribe brought back many fond memories and visions of happy days to come.' THAT some night students dont know how well off they are, weeks before school starts and we poor newspaper hounds are hard at work, ah me! life is so unjust . . . say Joe, fill it up again and Ill gladly pay you on Tuesday.THAT thats that, and Ill beseenya!

My but that week went fast. Another ramble from the Idle Student duo and I havent begun to find my bearings or whatever you call 'em. Tempus fuget or the like, Wu tell them. It beats all how he days fly by, I cant say rilghts because the night session has not oegun for us yet; wont be long though until we are all in the .arness again for one more year ifwell you know what it is beter than I do, books, slide rules, and the like which go to make up college course. All of these Jadgets dont worry me one bit oecause I take the courses sorta nonchalant as it were and if I dont succeed, well its all apropos to the character of the Idle night ^student.I see Carnegie has taken to the Jr according to an announcement n last weeks Tartan. Dr. Baker naugurated the series and several members of the faculty are scheduled to give talks from time to ime. The Tartan is not to be outdone by this ascendency to the ethereal waves on the part of the mentors at our institution so the air will be thickest on Mondays at 5:35 p. m. when the "Campus Notes will be flung to the four winds by no less a personage than our worthy Editor'. The station to propel the hot .shots will be 
WWSW.
Speaking of hot shots brings us to Puppet. Yes sir, The Puppet has turned over a new leaf for the yearthink of itonly ten cents for a copy of this humorous magazine. That sure is a bargain counter item. And by way of double inducement they too are taking to the air with a broadcast feature each week. Think of it, The Puppet and a space on the air each week Via Radio all for ten cents. Say we arent Scotch. Many a augh will be secured at the small lost of ten cents. Did you say ten jents? Yes, I said ten cents.Say It isn't sothat school will .start next week. It is hard to picture the summer being over and time for another year ofwell whatever you wish. I thought 1 would have a lot of time on my hands before we started in to march out to the campus. Think of the many nights of thrills which are In store for us this year. Picture If you can walking over the cut with the wind blowing a gale of 110 miles an hour and by way of diversion you start to chase your elusive hat down the ravine. These and many other pleasant thoughts and memories will be ours when we matriculate for another year at Carnegie seeking to enrich our store of knowledge so that we will be able to combat the cruel world In its demand for education.
I was out to the Campus last week to look around for any {changes to report, but I am sorry to relate that I couldnt see any big change. It; may be that I had on dark glasses or that it was too dark to see (the time oC my appearance was 10:00 p. m.) At all events I just couldnt see any diange. However, Ill keep my feather eye open for any change hd just as soon as I note any Ill lug about it. I know a couple of eople who always have informalon on the new things and 1mIovements which are to take place nd I am going to Interview them, la.vbe they can put me wise to the hanges.
One thing I did notice, was that ic grass was green and Ill bet the nrdener spent a pleasant summer linking about his trip abroad last 
Jmmer. No doubt he learned ome new stunts on how to make le grass grow greener because it urely does appear greener than /er before. There is something 
du sorta spread on it to make it *ow, the name has slipped my

Coming directly on the heels of the Depression Art Show held recently in the shadow of the tower of recreation and fake gothic decorations, is the news that juryless art shows are to be in vogue here this winter.Several Tech students and graduates are members of the group of young artists, who are determined to teach the people of Pittsburgh the habit of attending art shows regularly.
Realizing that they must keep abreast of the young college graduates to hold their positions, elderly men and women are registering for courses in English, mathematics and other elementary subjects in the high school of'Temple Uni-; versity and other colleges.The general demand by firms and corporations throughout the country for college bred men and women to fill even minor positions -has caused them to fear for their jobs in these days of depression, it is believed, hence the reason for this sudden thirst for knowledge.Just an empty victory the boys will agree. They were probably engaged in laying plans for making the college football team all the while, and ignored the old contest.

To think that we were left out. Tis rumored that four Carnegie lads get all the breaks.

The. tough part of it was that Two Bricks Robinson couldnt make the heightjust the case of another career nipped in the bud, and so Charley Bet You Cant Pronounce It Schatvet was substituted.
They found out that they were to be movie stars. Imagine. Gosh, did our bashful Fergus go for that. After promenading before the boss of the shebang, the boys were dismissed for the day.
The next day they learned, so the story goes, that they made such a hit that it was thought best to import professionals from New York. And to think, none of the boys are dramats. Page Mr. Kenyon.

The Interfraternity Council Pamphlet
A pamphlet explaining in part the fraternity situation at 
Carnegie has been issued this fall to freshmen for the first time 
by the Interfraternity Council. "While the pamphlet is not as 
complete as it might be, it is a notable attempt by the council to 
inform the freshmen of the advantages of fraternity life. It is 
hoped that this innovation is an indication of the interest that 
will be shown by members of the council in fraternity affairs 
during the coming year.
One of the most important problems the council faces 
at the outset is the formulation of adequate and, if possible, sat
isfactory rushing rules. Although considerable time was de
voted to this problem last year, the outcome was nothing further 
than the handing down of a set of rules for consideration this 
year. The recommended changes were in many places too in
volved and, if applied in the present form, would only cause 
more complications and dissatisfaction.
There are several worthwhile recommendations which 
should be seriously considered by the council. Among these are 
the ones for the alleviation of the present system of contacting 
freshmen, the reduction of rushing expenses (an absolute neces
sity this year), and the enforcement of rushing regulations.
The initiative for the formulation of a satisfactory system 
must come from the various fraternities through their repre
sentatives on the council, for it is only by conscientious en
deavor and concerted action through regular fraternity meet
ings that the representatives on the council can know the true 
sentiment of the fraternal groups at large.
Upperclassmen And Assemblies
In giving Delta Skull, mens junior class honorary society, 
direct charge of the planning of general student assemblies this 
year, the Student Council is to be commended for placing the 
planning of the programs in the hands of an organization which 
should be capable of stimulating greater student interest for 
this worthwhile Carnegie institution. This society, in co-operation with President Baker, Dean Green, Dean Tarbell and the 
Student Council, is laying plans for an interesting series of pro
grams for the coming year.
In the past, upperclassmen have had a tendency not to at
tend assemblies, either because attendance was not required or 
because they have not been sufficiently interested in the pro
grams. It will be interesting to see what success the junior 
class honorary will have in' assuaging this indifference on the 
part of upperclassmen.
The interfraternity Council has 
donated to the Y club room 
paintings of all the campus fraternity seals. The seals, which are twelve inches long and nine inches wide, are now hung in the club room.
Josef Lentz, a sub-senior in the Department of Painting and Decorating, is responsible for the 
art work done on the seals. They are hand-painted in the official colors of the fraternities, and are encased in narrow black frames.

ITS JUST ONE DANCE AFTER ANOTHER
The past week saw the social season get under way with all notables on deck. We understand that it officially got started at the Phi Kappa house Wednesday night. Ask Bill McKenna.
The Plebes found out Wednesday that a tea dance is not a tea dance. The Mortar Boards, that austere group of young ladies from the senior class, let the cat out of the bag last Wednesday afternoon. A bunch o.f the old gang was there. Yessir! Even Logan Webster of huntthe-job fame was on hand with one Evelyn Gamble. Frank Schneller, Brad Edelblut, Joe Bronson, and all the rest of the printers were right in the thick of things. Advance notice was served on the Sigma Nus that the Delts are going to be a real threat for the title of the noisiest dancers on the campus when Ernie Schleusener demonstrated a mighty mean shag. Tis rumored that daily sessions are being held over on Clyde street. The major tragedy of the afternoon occurred when Joe Lentz discovered the or809 Liberty Avenue Evenings -10c

that it has been largely a labor of love, and that he passes on to his readers a wealth of entertaining information, touched with considerable charm and humor.
The book takes up the towns as one journeys through them, traveling south from Boston, out to Provincetown and back on the southern shore and tells anecdotes of characters belonging to each and calls attention to old houses and curious landmarks. Dean Tarbell has included many fine half-tone cuts showing historic spots and typical scenes. Cape Cod Ahoy! is a cheery travel
book for any one visiting the Cape 
for the first time to read enroute.

Dean Tarbell has recently written a book for the summer visitor at Cape Cod entitled, Cape Cod Ahoy! This book is the result of the authors enthusiasm and love for this ocean outpost and of a search for all scenes and stories likely to prove interesting to the stranger visiting 'these shores. The comment has been made, Dean Tarbell knows his Cape by virtue of Twenty seasons spent in roaming its nooks and c'orners, and by virtue also, if one may interpret between the lines, of much more time than that spent in reading and research. He has, in consequence, brought to light many attractive bits of the Cape, present and past, that are likely to prove fresh offerings to even those oldtimers, the native born and the veteran cottage folk. It is quite evident that he has been unhurried and painstaking in his work,

Behold, sophomores, Carnegie has another freshman class! 
Those people on the campus wearing dinks, armbands, black 
ties, and black socks are freshmennearly six hundred of them, 
too.
Maybe we are wrong, but our somewhat unsteady memory 
recalls that as freshmenthat was oh so long agowe were 
told that Carnegie had a few traditions. Yes, even several 
songs and one or two of those raucous, guttural rumblings 
sometimes referred to as cheers. And mind you, we were told 
that we must speak to upperclassmenof all things!

praisal. It is too limited by momentary prejudices in human conduct. As late as the nineteenth century men were passive in thought, but by the second half of that century the passive democracy had become an active one and no traditions of public opinion remained.
Therefore, we must not expect society to be guided by its professors untilthe fluctuating opinions that now govern affairs are replaced by clear, settled moral values.
Recognition of tliis difficulty of human conduct would ' aid immeasurably in settling the scholars troubled spirit. He would be 
encouraged to preserve that detachment from affairs which his instinct demands. If lie is still moved to intervene he could do so not as a scholar but as one more 
amateur. His chief duty in the crisis is, however, to understand, so that the next crisis may be more intelligible.The immediate has never been 
the realm of the scholar. His provinces are the past, from which he distills understanding, and future, for which he prepares insight. The immediate is for his purpose a mere fragment of the past, to be observed and remembered rather than to be dealt with and managed."I. doubt whether the student can do a greater work for his nation in this grave moment of its history than to detach himself 
from its preoccupations, refusing to let himself be absorbed by dis
tractions about which, as a scholar, he can do almost nothing. For this is not the last crisis in human affairs. The world will go on somehow, and more crises will follow. It will go on best, however, if among us there are men who have stood apart, who refused to be anxious or too much concerned, who were cool and inquiring, and had their eyes on a longer past and a longer future. By their example they can remind us that the passing moment is only a moment,"

vately endowed schools are ex

The College of Industries has shoAvn the largest drop with a total of 1S4 this year and 277 last for a decrease of 93. The decrease is 
attributed partly to the transfer of 
several courses from this college to the College of Engineering. This years total includes: Special, 12; short-course, 2G;_, senior, 49; junior, 59; and sophomore, 38.The freshman Engineering and Industries class shows the next largest drop with a figure of 31S against last years 392 for a decrease of 7-1.

when many are expected to enroll who have postponed their entrance a year.The College of Fine Arts shows a decrease of but 10, with a figure of 573 against last years 583.
