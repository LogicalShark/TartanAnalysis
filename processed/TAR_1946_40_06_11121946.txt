Technical Revives 
Techsperts Page
The next issue of the Carnegie 
Technical marks the return of the 
Techsperts. This feature, one of 
the most popular in the magazine, 
was started in the February, 1943, 
issue and is being reactivated at 
the request of the student body.
The experts undertake to an
swer questions pertaining to any 
field of science or engineering 
which are solvable by known 
methods. If a question is accepted, 
the sender will receive $2 if he 
cant answer it and the Techs
perts can. The sender receives $5 
for a question which he can an
swer but which stumps the Techs
perts.
Dave Wallace, Techsperts edit

A1 Minetti, Famed Cheerleader, 
Succumbs Unexpectedly Saturday
Response to Traditional Student Chant of We Want Al!
Brings Fatal Heart Attack Upon Former Tartan Cheerleader
Al Minetti's Spirit Lives On 
After His Last Cheer Dies
The final whistle blew. The 
gridders walked off the field. As 
the people left Forbes Field, they 
knew Tech had lost a football 
game. But had they known what 
was happening behind the scenes, 
they would have realized that 
Tech had lost not only a ball 
game. It had lost one of its verte
brae  Al Minetti was dead.
Always ready to do his share,
Colgate Prentice Urges Action 
To Form World Government
That a strong world organiza
tion is the only way to prevent 
another war, was the main 
premise made by Colgate Prentice 
last Wednesday. Mr. Prentice, 
president of the Student Federal
ists, spoke before an open meet
ing of the C. I. T. International 
Relations club.
Mr. Prentice asserted that It is 
impossible to have peace without 
justice, justice without law, and 
law without a strong federalized 
world government. Fatalism, he 
said, is engulfing the world.
He agree that there is perhaps 
no solution to the atom bomb, 
that perhaps civilization is doom
ed. but though no action taken 
now may be successful, he feels 
that at least people should try to 
do something.
W. Wesley Cooley Appointed 
As Professor In Management
Appointment of W. Wesley 
Cooley, of Wilkinsburg, as Asso
ciate Professor of Management 
Engineering at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology has been announced 
by Dr. Webster N. Jones, Director 
of the College of Engineering and 
Science.
Mr. Cooley, formerly Headquar
ters Supervisor of Industrial 
Training at the Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation, had been 
with that company since 1928, en
tering its employ as a trades ap
prentice at the age of 16. He has 
served as a machinist and in Time 
Study and also in the Industrial 
Relations Headquarters. He re
ceived the degree of Bachelor of 
Science in Vocational Education 
from the University of Pittsburgh 
in 1939.
The author of several publica
tions in the field of industrial re
lations, Mr. Cooley is a member 
of the Society for the Advancement 
of Management, the National As
sociation of Foremen, American 
Association of Training Directors,
American Apprentie Pound TaW. Wesley Cooley
ble (Division of the American So
ciety of Mechanical Engineers), 
and the Masonic Order. He is 
chairman of the Training Com
mittee of the Pittsburgh Personnel 
Association.
Mr. Cooley is married and has 
two daughters. The Cooleys make 
their home at 408 Biddle Ave.f 
Wilkinsburg,
Prentice believes that the only 
way to prevent another war is to 
have a federated league to which 
each country will send delegates 
determined by their population. 
These delegates should have the 
power to enforce their decisions 
and should be backed by a world 
police force.
Mr. Prentice maintained that 
the world cannot have a strong 
league when each unit remains 
independent, and that only when 
each gives up some of its rights 
and powers to the organization 
can a strong centralized world 
government be formed.
Mr. Prentice went on to say 
that it is conceivable that some 
day soon we are going to wake 
up to the greatest war the world 
has ever known. World govern
ment, he said, is a form of life 
insurance against that war.
The Student' Federalists have 
over one hundred chapters in the 
United States. There are chapters 
in Great Britain and France, and 
some are being organized in 
Greece and various countries in 
South America.
Mr. Prentice suggested the for
mation of a chapter at Carnegie 
Tech. Any students who would be 
interested in joining such an or
ganization are requested to con
tact Clara Herron at SC 6519.
Cwen T\vin Sister Tea 
Honors Co-Ed Transfers
Cwens, sophomore womens 
honorary society, will hold a 
twin sister tea at Carnegie Un
ion, Monday afternoon, November 
18, from four to six. All transfer 
students are invited to attend.
If any woman transfer student 
in any of the colleges has not 
heard from her twin sister by the 
end of the week, she should con
tact Mary Lou Thorpe, president 
of Cwens at Whitfield hall, Sc. 
9162.
All woman transfer students at 
Carnegie Tech are assigned twin 
s:stcrs from among the members 
cf Cwens. Through this arrange
ment, Cwens try to make the new 
student feel more at home at Car* 
negie Tech.
Albert C. Minetti, Carnegie Techs perennial cheerleader, 
died of a heart attack in Magee Hospital at 5:30 Saturday after
noon.
Only two hours before he had been at Forbes Field leading 
the cheers of the Tartan fans. At half time he complained of 
dizziness and was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed 
soon afterwards.
Al, who was 43, established himself as the top cheerleader 
in this part of the country even before his graduation from Car
negie Tech in 1925. His acrobatic stunts brought him wide 
acclaim, and from that time on he never missed a home game 
and went to many an event out of town. Every time the famous
chant, We want Al, summoned 
him to continue the role he filled 
as a student.
At Carnegie Tech Al majored in 
civil engineering and continued in 
this profession after graduation. 
For the last twelve years he has 
been employed by the U. S. Gov
ernment Engineers.
In addition to his activity as 
head cheerleader, Al, during his 
undergraduate years, was a mem
ber of Sigma Epsilon Phi and 
Theta Tau, a section leader, and a 
member of the Science Stag Stunt 
committee. At that time, cheer
leaders were not given varsity 
letters for their work but, as a 
token of the schools appreciation 
and affection, Al was awarded a 
major C at a special ceremony 
during a basketball game in 1940.
He is survived by his wife, Mrs. 
Mary Mitchell Minetti; a 10-year 
old daughter, Maureen; four sis
ters, and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. 
Ralph Minetti of Carrick.
Al had responded to the chant, 
We want Al, which has echoed 
at Techs games for the past two 
decades. As usual, everyone in 
the cheering section marveled at 
the agility and spirit of the figure 
before them. They made the walls 
shake with the cheer as Al put 
everything he had into The In
stitute. Little did they know that 
the flip which followed the cheer 
was to be the last. No one realized 
that when Al walked off the field 
immediately after the cheer he 
was a sick man, and that the final 
curtain was soon to be rung down 
on one of the greatest showmen 
who ever lived.
Al caught the spirit of Carnegie 
while he studied here in the early 
twenties. He received a degree in 
civil engineering but never really 
graduated. He was back to take 
his place with his fellow cheer
leaders the next year and the year 
after that. Year in, year out, the 
old Institute rang through the 
air at Carnegie Tech. Whether the 
footballers were beating Notre 
Dame or the casrers were losing to 
Pitt, Al was always there. Rain or 
shine, sleet or snow, The Insti
tute rolled on, led by a diminu
tive man who gave his all on 
each occasion.

Liaison Committee 
Reports Activities
Ernie Snoyer, sophomore engi
neering student, was elected to the 
Studerit-Faculty Liaison commit
tee at the meeting Tuesday after
noon, November 5. Ernie is a 
very active resident of Scobell 
Hall and is business manager of 
the Dorm Bagpiper.
The Student-Faculty Liaison 
committee of the College of En
gineering was formed in July, 
1944, to provide a means for the 
students to acquaint the faculty 
with their opinions, criticisms, and 
suggestions to improve the effec
tiveness of the college as an edu
cational unit.
The aims of the committee are: 
to call attention to problems which 
the students believe merit consid
eration, to provide a source of 
student opinion in matters re
quiring student-faculty attention, 
to help to improve teaching meth
ods, and to make .investigations 
and obtain information that will 
assist in pursuing the preceding 
aims.
The committee, which meets 
every Tuesday afternoon, is at 
present composed of August E. 
Binder, Jr Cloyd R. Mellott, Rich
ard L. Heckman, Richard C. 
Eschenbach, James A. Garner, Dr.

The Kilties Are Coming!
Perhaps our football isnt too red-hot but our Kiltie band 
is terrific is a typical remark often overheard at football games 
and in Skibo.
This exemplifies the concensus of student opinion and is 
probably the greatest tribute we could give our Kilties.
It almost seems miraculous that in so short a time :the band 
could be so completely reoganized that it could follow in the 
footsteps of pre-war Kiltie bands without losing a step.
With no unfounded pride Carnegie Tech can again boast 
one of the best and most colorful bands in the country.
The organizers and members, whose enthusiasm and hard 
work are responsible for this success, deserve unrestrained ap
plause from all of us.
The marching, formations, music, and the inimitable high
land fling are great stuff. Even our opponents concede victory 
there.
With a braggadocious grin we Tartans can readily quip 
and brightly so: Our Kiltie band can spell anything.

Stars of Playhouse Production
Boy Meets Girl
Overcoming the double handicap 
of a poor play and an inferior 
supporting cast, A1 Checco and 
Phyllis Ann Love, both C.I.T. dramats, are giving outstanding per
formances in the leading roles of 
Boy Meets Girl, the Pittsburgh 
Playhouses second production of 
the season.
Checco plays Law, one of the 
two zany script writers who man
age to increase even Hollywoods 
proverbial madness. Imagining 
himself to be a frustrated novelist,
Fraternity Flashes
Casanova. Claghornish woman 
hater Joe Phelps completely re
versed his field at the ATO Hal
loween party Saturday night, as 
he impartially bestowed his at
tention on all women present.
Tall, husky Jim Dinwiddie 
joined the PiKA pledge ranks this 
week, bringing the total up to 
ten.
In. After a" grueling weekend, 
six new ATO actives were placed 
on the rolls. They were Lester 
Siciliano, Robert Reed, Charles 
Taylor, Victor Moore, William 
Bickerstaff, and Robert Lewis.
Hair-raising. Astounding was 
the hair-do of tall, smooth Gene 
Cordells date at the ATO tea 
dance last Thursday. Entertain
ed were the girls of Laurel and 
Linden Halls.
Maiden Voyage. With unmixed 
joy the TXs watched Charlie 
Perots antique, much repaired 
Buick sail majestically down 
Forbes Street early this week. No 
longer will the grease spattered 
house be littered with pistons, 
valves, and gears.
Prankish. Squat, blonde Phil 
Malenock was enjoying his sixth 
childhood by Halloweening dull 
study rooms of the Phi Kap house 
to make up for the fun he is not 
having as football manager and 
waterboy.
Newest among the sixteen hap
py, anticipating Phi Kap pledges 
is large-framed, popular Warren 
Martin.
Optimistic. Trying to get a line 
on a trophy is hot-eyed Andy 
Cantini, able chairman of the Phi 
Kap football award committee.
Reticence. For once Jack Bos
ley and Prof Ed Schatz were 
not arguing over their receding 
hairlines at a recent Phi Kap sup
per. ReasonEds former Tech 
classmate Ginny Wright, M42, 
was a guest.
Notice
Veterans who have made a 
ten dollars admission deposit 
are requested to call at the 
cashiers office for a refund. 
Refunds will be made on the 
presentation of the admis
sions office receipts and the 
registration receipt.
If a veteran is a dormitory 
 resident, an application of ten 
dollars admission deposit to
ward the payment of his ac
count has been made. No 
further action on his part is 
necessary.
ATO pledged slender, violin 
playing Barry Dietrick this week.
Victory. Celebrating Tau Delts 
spent last Friday night reveling 
their 12-7 touch-rootball victory 
over their traditional rivals, the 
Beta Sigs, in a rip-roaring beer 
and song session.
The ranks of Tau Delta Phi 
pledges were reduced to eleven 
by the recent initiation of Sid 
Greenswag, Hal Lipchik, Len 
Chotiner, and Bob Goldstein, but 
the pinning of Marv Stein brought 
it up to a round dozen.
Everyone at the Tau Delt house 
took out additional life insurance 
before accepting rides in Eph 
Abramsons Ford of vintage 1934. 
Its the only coupe in Pittsburgh 
that can hold ten peopledont 
ask how.
Law constantly talks about re
turning to his native Vermont to 
write about real life, but he 
realizes that he is. kidding him
self and is slightly sick about it. 
Actually he is quite happy in 
Hollywood but knows that he 
should not be, and Checco brings 
out this conflict very well. And, 
although the rest of the cast seems 
to conspire against him to kill 
every one of his buildups, he man
ages to put across enough laughs 
to make the show a fairly enjoy
able one.
The female lead in the play is 
Susie, a waitress in the studio 
commissary. At the beginning of 
the show she is expecting a child 
whose father is duly married  
but, Susie says, she did not know 
that. Law and his partner Benson 
are inspired by this coming happy 
event and writes a new variation 
to their never-failing script for
mula: boy meets girl, boy loses 
girl, boy gets girl. The baby ob
tains a movie contract, Susie rises 
to riches and fame, and, still the 
naive and bewildered girl she 
was at the beginning, ends this 
fairy tale by marrying her Prince 
Charming.
Phyllis Ann Love, the other 
bright star in the Playhouses dim 
galaxy, avoids the great pitfall of 
making Susie coy. She is naive 
rather than sweet, and frank rath
er than stupid. Together with 
Checco she salvages most of the 
few laughs of the play.

Soc. R$l. Electives
I should like to correct a mis
statement which was made in your 
article concerning the proceedings 
of the Proteus Clan. The idea 
brought up. at this time was not 
that languages are more import
ant than Social Relations for phy
sics majors. Our contention is that 
foreign languages are just as use
ful in the furtherment of human 
relations as such subjects as his
tory, and that they should there
fore be placed on an equal basis 
with those subjects which are at 
present included in the Social Re
lations program. This change 
would merely widen the scope of 
elective Social Relations courses. 
At present there is only a small 
number of such courses available. 
These elective courses, of which 
two must be taken, are at present 
of very limited scope. We are sug
gesting that foreign languages be
included in the list of elective So
cial Relations courses, which al
ready includes English literature.
This plan is not just for physics 
majors, but for all engineers.
Respectfully yours,

New Student Directory 
Completed This Week
The 1946-47 Carnegie Tech Stu
dent Directory will be out this 
week and will go on sale at the 
4 Bookstore. Its price will be 25c 
as in former years. Because the 
directory will be the largest in 
years, listing approximately 3400 
names and addresses, it is being 
published in a new size and for
mat with a 6x9 double-column 
page instead of pocket size.
Published by the department of 
public relations and printed by 
the department of printing, the 
directory will contain, in addition 
to the names and addresses of un
dergraduate and graduate day 
students, a list of current frater
nity and dormitory telephone 
numbers, lists of officers, members 
and pledges of fraternities and 
sororities, officers and members of 
honorary societies, and officers of 
22 campus organizations.
Notice
There will be a regular 
meeting for everyone work
ing on the December SCOTTIE every Monday at 4:30 in 
the Carnegie Union.
Students To Vote 
For Carnival Band
An election will be held Tues
day and Wednesday, November 
19-20, from 11:30 a. m. to 1:30 
p. m., to determine what band 
the students want for Spring Car
nival.
It will be an all-school election 
and registration cards will be 
needed for voting. Balloting will 
be preferential. All students are 
urged to make their selection so 
that the most popular band may 
be obtained.
ODK, which is sponsoring the 
carnival, states that fullest con
sideration will be given the re
sults of the poll.
Attempts are being made to se
cure a fourth ballot box whidh 
will be placed in Machinery hall. 
This, together with the two voting 
days, will enable everyone to find 
time to vote without standing in 
line or missing lunch.
Let It Grow !!!
Keep off the grass! Almost 
everyone has noticed the little 
signs scattered over the lawn in 
front of the Fine Arts Building, 
and some have even been moved 
to ask, What grass? However, 
the fact remains that someone is 
trying to give the lawn a fighting 
chance.
In spite of the fact that nothing 
grows in the winter, except per
haps adults around the middle, an 
effort is obviously being made to 
prepare for next spring. Perhaps 
they are doing this to encourage 
people to cut classes. Bare ground 
is very discouraging to a good 
bridge game. Perhaps they are 
just making it is easy for P & Ds, 
who are eternally drawing the 
Fine Arts Building. Or they might 
have in mind preventing a recur
rence of the dust bowl and the 
resulting pollution of the pure 
Pittsburgh air.
Whatever the purpose, the fact 
remains that the school needs your 
full support and co-operation in 
their campaign to get Grass for 
You by 52! Please send all pen
ny donations for the seed fund to 
R. Corey Eschenbach, Secretary 
for the Society for the Promo
tion of Young Sprouts, 5020 Morewood PI.

free preview of the nights con

Th music students took advan
tage of Mr. Kappell. as a man 
who is already there, to get 
some tips from h*m. He advised 
them to work for relaxation, and 
to eliminate excitement entirely 
from their pre-concert personali
ties. He himself is always able to 
sleep before a concert.
Furthermore, Mr. Kappell as
serted, in the long run a balanced 
personality is more important to 
a musician than excessive techni
cal knowledge. Consequently, he 
thinks, a well rounded scholastic 
program such as Tech offers to its 
music students is worth while.

Scotch and Soda Is Back!
History Of 
S. and SL
Club News Of 
S. and S.
Nine years ayo the students of 
Carnegie Tech established the 
Scotch and Soda Club, an organ
ization which compiles all the 
campus writing, singing, dancing, 
and acting talent into an annual 
musical show.
The unique feature of the club 
is that it is an all-school activity, 
open to everyone. Some students 
have a chance to apply their field 
of study in it, and others take this 
opportunity to do things quite re
mote from their daily chores. 
Many a non-dramat has, through 
Scotch and Soda, realized his am
bition to put on the grease paint.
The first production of Scotch 
and Soda, No Strings, was pre
sented in 1938 during Spring Car
nival week. Everyone connected 
with' the show was a student at 
Carnegie Tech  from the script 
writer to the crew boy who just 
came around to one rehearsal. It 
was a refreshing relief to audi
ences to see a college show with 
real girls, rather than football 
players with nothing to recom
mend them but a bit of padding.
More of a revue than a musical, 
the second production in 1939, 
Take It Straight, demonstrated 
that the club organization was an 
efficient one, by producing a bet
ter and more spirited presenta
tion. It was followed in 1940 by 
One On the House, which played 
three performances instead of the 
former two.
The spring of 1941 brought 
Heres to You, the fourth annual 
production of Scotch and Soda, 
which was again something new. 
It was not a musical, nor was it 
a disconnected revue. Around 
Shubert Alley it would be known 
as a revue with book, which 
means that it was a show com
posed of numbers not too closely 
related but linked by a story run
ning through the whole show.
During all this time the Scotch 
and Soda Club had been develop
ing a more far-sighted program 
than the mere production of the 
show. Plans for the future includ
ed a scholarship financed by the 
club, a week-long instead of a 
three day performance, and event
ually a tour of the tri-state area.
In 1942, for the first time since 
the club was organized, no pro
duction was presented. To cope 
with the war situation it was ne
cessary for the college to do away 
with the traditional program of 
Spring Carnival. This change in 
program forced students working 
on the new Scotch and Soda show 
to discontinue full production. In 
order not to waste time and effort 
already spent, a vaudeville show

The Scotch and Soda club, an 
extracurricular organization 
which, until 1942, pre^n.ed an 
annual musical snow during 
Spring Carnival week, was offi
cially reactivated last week.
After receiving the go-ahead 
signal from its Board of Trustees 
and going through the necessary 
channels, a group of former S & S 
members, who recently returned 
from service, obtained approval 
of Student Council.
Mitch Agruss, A1 Checco, Er
nie Motyl, Bob Parks, Les Stan
ford, and Bill Thunhurst under
took this task under the chair
manship of Jim Boyce.
When Scotch and Sodas activi
ties were suspended in 1942, a 
Board of Trustees was created. Its 
members included Dr. Glendenning Keeble, then dean of the Col
lege of Fine Arts, Dean Warden, 
and the faculty of the drama de
partment.
This body was invested with 
control of the funds of the club 
and was to determine the appro
priate time for Scotch and Sodas 
reactivation.
At Spring Carnival last spring, 
Danny Franks and Helen Miller 
produced Take It From Here. The 
returning members of Scotch and 
Soda felt that the interest shown 
in this enterprise and its success 
proved that the time for reactiva
tion of the club had come.
Scotch and Soda Personalities
Jim Boyce, (senior dramat, 
has been a vital member of the 
administrative section of 
Scotch and Soda since his ar
rival at Carnegie Tech in the 
fall of 1940. He worked as as
sistant business manager in the 
successful  41 production, 
Heres To You, and was ap
pointed to the post of business 
manager the following year. 
He is an active member of 
Delta Upsilon and ODK.
Al Checco acted and danced 
in the 41 S and S show. He 
has been in show business 
around Pittsburgh for many 
years and is a familiar person
ality in all things theatrical at
C.I.T. He is remembered as 
the judge in last years Trial 
by Jury, and is currently
starring in the Playhouse pro
duction of Boy Meets Girl.
Mitch Agruss was assistant 
technical director in the 41 
show and an important cog in 
the wheel of backstage produc
tion. Last year he was seen in 
Sunlight Sonata and has a 
leading role in the forthcom
ing production of Saint 
Joan. 
Ernie Motyl is perhaps best 
remembered as one of the or
iginators of Two Monsters 
Create a Mad Scientist, which 
was so successful in Heres 
To You and was revived in
WOW !
last years Spring Carnival 
show. A senior dramat, he is a 
member of the S and S execu
tive board and served with A1 
Checco on the advertising staff* 
Les Stanford was active in 
both the 1940 and 1941 Scotch 
and Soda productions. A mem
ber of the Sigma Nu fraternity, 
he has done radio work in - 
New York and Pittsburgh. Re
cently he appeared as Tom in 
Time of Your Life.
Bill Thunhurst is a well 
known campus figure and was 
elected King of Hearts last 
year. He is a CIT letter man 
and member of Beta Theta Pi 
and ODK. Bill created a mild 
sensation last year as Orlando 
in As You Like It and Ed
win in Trial by Jury.
After several meetings, it was 
decided to stimulate interest and 
to facilitate reorganization by 
means of an all-school script con
test. The best script would be 
used in the first post-war Scotch 
amLSoda show.
Although monetary reward was 
not found necessary in pre-war 
years, Student Council is offering 
this year a prize of $200 for the 
best entry. This is supposed to be 
an added stimulus as well as a 
means by which Council can show 
its gratitude to Scotch and Soda 
for the services it has rendered to 
Carnegie Tech.
Entries must be received by 
Scotch and Soda by noon, Satur
day, November 16.
In the past voting members of 
Scotch were those students who 
actively participated in the pro
duction of an S & S show.
While last years Spring Car
nival show, Take It From Here, 
was not produced by the club, the 
returning members felt that the 
people connected with that revue
 displayed interest and ability pre
requisite to membership in Scotch 
and Soda.
It was therefore proposed that 
the executive committee of the 
club confer with the chairman of 
last years affair and on his rectContinued on page 8]

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1046
TECH SPORTS
Gridders Lose Fourth Straight; 
Case Engineers 24-0 Victory
The hapless Tartans continued in their scoreless ways last Sat
urday as they were defeated by Case to the discord of 24 to ZERO. 
For the Skibo gridders it was only the fourth loss since 1943. The loss 
was a costly one, however, as it cost the team the services of two 
of its stellar performersBrute Meyers with a concussion and C. B. 
Groomes, who further aggravated his rib injury.
The game started as Miller took the Case kickoff and returned 
it 10 yards to the Carnegie 40. In three more plays the Skibos ran
the ball to the 45 which was as far as they managed to advance
the ball all afternoon against a stout Case defense. An exchange of 
fumbles found Tech in possession 
of the ball on their own 30 when 
Highberger dropped back to 
punt. The kick was blocked, re
covered by Case and three plays 
later Bill Oatis crossed the goal 
line for the visitors first touch
down. That was all the scoring 
in the first quarter.
Case Scores Again
The second period again saw 
Case score as they staged a 60- 
yard drive culminated by Gerace 
plunging over from the 1. Case 
threatened again late in the quar
ter but a determined Tartan de
fense held on the 4. The half end
ed with Techs lone scoring op
portunity of the day as Wahrenburg looped a long pass which 
an over-anxious receiver dropped 
in the clear.
The third quarter was listless 
until the dying moments when 
Case again started a sustained 
drive from their own 24. The 
Skibo defense fell apart and in 
nine plays, Case had another 
score as Fort skirted the right 
end for Touchdown number three.
Skibos Block Conversion Attempts
Case scored for the fourth and 
last time early in the fourth quar
ter with Menster going over from 
the 6 yard line. However, the team 
broke through the defense and 
thwarted for the fourth time the
Thinclads Win; 
Trim Titans
The Tech Harriers won their 
third victory of the current cam
paign by trimming a weak West
minster team 18-37 over the 
Schenley Park course Saturday. 
Only one place in the first five 
went to the visitors. Beamer of 
Tech took first in 24:17 followed 
by Davies, also of the Tartans. 
Paul Rotzler was nosed out in a 
sprint at the finish for third posi
tion. Gene Cockerell, freshman 
threat, ran fifth. Benya and Childs 
rounded out the scoring for the 
home team.
Wednesday the Tech B team 
will run the Pitt Bs, while the 
varsity will be idle until the nine
teenth. The final collegiate meet 
will be a return match with a 
strengthened Geneva team, which 
will have its ace, Crawford, back 
in action. He was lost to the squad 
because of illness earlier in the 
season but will be back to give the 
Skibos trouble in the coming 
meet.
The A. A. U. affair on the twen
ty-third will be the final meet 
of the season for the thinclads. 
Competing against the best in the 
district, Halfertys Harriers are 
hoping to run their best meet of 
the year in this pay-off encounter.
 The seasons record to date 
shows 3-up, 1-down.
Notice
Anyone want to write 
sports? Can anyone write 
sports? Why doesnt anyone 
want to write sports? The 
Tartan could use anyone who 
wants to write sports. No fuss, 
no bother, just come to the 
Tartan office on Sunday after
noon. Anyone who applies v 
will be guaranteed to make 
the Varsity.
Intramural
Roundup
With one more week of intra
mural football ahead, there is go
ing to be plenty of action before 
the campus champ is crowned. *A 
little heavy smog from time to 
time has lengthened the season, 
and there are still seven contests 
remaining before the chapionship 
playoffs.
Last weeks activity was re
stricted to the American and Fed
eral Leagues. The National teams 
were scheduled for Thursday but 
were rained out.
For the second consecutive 
week, the team-of-the-week is 
Tau Delta Phi. A pre-season un
derdog, the Tau Delts, after trip
ping the Beta Sigs last week, went 
on to down the league-leading 
PiKAs.
The PiKAs had a comfortable 
5-1 lead midway in the fourth 
quarter. Foster had blocked a pass 
and gone over for a TD in the 
third period and Cassler snagged a 
pass in the end-zone. However, the 
Tau Delts came from behind as 
Yorkin and Rubenfield shared the 
scoring honors. Final score: Tau 
Delts 11, PiKAs 10.
The other game in the Ameri
can League saw the Beta Sigs 
scrap together enough first downs 
to hand the SAEs a 5-1 defeat. 
FPHA-1 forfeited again.

Booters Win Third; 
Beat Westminster, 3-0
Three of the four ingredients 
necessary for a soccer game were 
present last Saturday as the Tar
tans booters swept to their third 
victory of the season by defeat
ing Westminster *3-0 in the Tech 
Bowl. The three ingredients on the 
scene were two teams and a field. 
The missing link was a referee. 
In the absence of officials, Mac 
McMullan took over the chore 
and did an excellent job.
For Pat OConnors boys, it was 
the second straight shutout, the 
other coming last week at the ex
pense of Thiel. The game wound 
up a home stay of five straight for 
the Techites. They have two 
games left, both abroad.
Luckily for Tech, the game was 
late in starting. This tardiness al
lowed Kindblom and Marmo and 
a couple other members of the 
squad to flunk the test they were 
taking in time to get to the game.
The Skibos showed their su
periority early in the game when 
they tallied three goals in the first 
period. Don Hart got the first one 
when the Tartan line put on its 
best display of passing this year. 
Mellott and Kroko combined 
forces to set up the shot and Hart 
banged the ball through the up
rights for the tally.
Shortly afterward, Bob Wil
liams pulled his favorite trick to 
give Tech another goal. Large 
Robert, who has returned to his 
center-half back position after be
ing idle during the first part of 
the current campaign, was 
awarded a free kick from mid
field and proceeded to loft the ball 
toward the goal. When the West
minister goalie was screened on 
the play by his own fullback, the 
ball dropped into pay dirt to give 
the Tartans a 2-0 lead.
Mellott remained in at left-in
side long enough to wind up the 
scoring with a good penalty kick. 
The second string held the visitors 
at bay for the rest of the game.

Don Palmer to Play For 
Thanksgiving Dance Nov. 30
Attention to all ye Evening Stu
dents who have been waiting for 
some long awaited social activi
ties. We have some very good 
news that you cant wait any 
longer pertaining to the coming 
Thanksgiving dance. Within the 
past week, the Student. Council 
has made some very good con
tacts, and after the dust cleared, 
they came out with the informa
tion that Don Palmer and his Or
chestra will be highlighting the 
affair with his three little girls in 
blue, known to many as the Mel
low Modes. To thinkthree 
song-birds instead of the usual 
one, and it happens to be the only 
band in the vicinity of Pittsburgh 
that has three girl vocalists to 
produce that sweet harmony you
Bureau of Placements
So that evening students, as 
well as the regular day students 
at Carnegie Tech may be employ
ed by concerns whose business 
closely resembles the courses 
studied by the student, the ad
ministration of the school has es
tablished a Bureau of Placements. 
This bureau maintains a separate 
department for the placement of 
evening students.
Anyone who is enrolled in 
classes at Carnegie Tech may reg
ister at the office in Industries 
Hall (Room 155) which is open 
Monday evenings from 6:30 to 
8:00. The bureau is also open 
from 9:00 to 5:00 during the week 
and from 9:00 to 12:00 Saturday 
mornings.
Since the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology aspires to a high 
scholastic standing of all those 
who attend, the businesses in and 
about the Pfttshurgh district often 
submit position vacancies to this 
agency. For this reasoi., the 
bureau may have in its files posi
tions closely allied to the stu
dents course of study. In many 
cases, the managements of these 
organizations are willing to aid 
the student in achieving the max
imum benefit from his attendance 
at evening school.
Those students who desire to 
take advantage of this service at 
no cost to themseives snould reg
ister with the bureau. Mr. Wangeman or Mr. Savin of the Bureau 
of Placements will be happy to 
talk with you about employment 
in line with your present course 
of study.

love to hear. Don Palmers band 
should start the Evening Schools 
social calendar off in grand style 
because his orchestra has played 
in the past for a number of suc
cessful Evening School dances.
The big event will take place 
on the evening of November 30, 
and will be in full swing from 
9:00 jtill 12:00. It will be held in 
Thistle Hall where many of the 
past dances have been given un
der the sparkling lights from the 
crystal ball, and if my informa
tion is correct, the hall has been 
redecorated just recently.
Tickets will go on sale Thurs
day, the 14th, and can be pur
chased from any member of the 
Student Council, PLAID staff, So
cial Committee, or from Mr. McKelway in the Evening School 
Office for the price of just 50 
cents per person.
As a final reminder we wish to 
mention that the social chairman, 
Ann Shack, suggests that we keep 
watching the bulletin boards for 
the novel posters that will pub
licize the dance.

Women Evening Students Plan 
Organization of Tech Sorority
This years enrollment in Carnegie Techs evening classes has 
been the largest since the pre-war years; and even though\the num
ber of men still outnumber the women, there is a large group of the 
feminine counterpart attending classes.
It has often been said that a social organization for the women 
evening students should exist on the campus so that more of these 
girls can become better acquainted, and associate with one another. 
At various stages ip the develop
ment of the evening school, such 
suggestions have been made, but 
unfortunately without action. Just 
recently the suggestion was again 
made, and taken seriously by some 
of the women on the campus. It 
is the hope of this group that the 
current school year will see the 
culmination of some of the plans 
for a sorority in Carnegie Techs 
evening school.
At the present time, there is 
very little, if anything, on which 
to base an organization of this 
type. But with the help and co
operation of those interested, its 
goal should not be too difficult 
to achieve. It is not without basis 
that the word help is used, for 
founding a sorority involves more 
than the well-known task of elect
ing officers, even though this is
one of its first issues. Following 
in close order are such items as 
establishing a purpose, standards, 
by-laws, traditions, and many 
other components which constitute 
a sturdy and secure organization.
The women of the evening stu
dent body are asked for their sup
port in this venture. All those 
who are interested in becoming 
charter members of Carnegie 
Techs first evening school social 
sorority are urged to send their 
name, address, and phone number 
(business and home) to Box 256, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology.
It is anticipated that the first 
organizational meeting will be 
held sometime near the end of 
November or the early part of 
December. THE PLAID will carry 
all future announcements con
cerning this new organization.
Information gives YOU the answers 
... who gives them to HER?
A lot of people take the Information Ser
vice of the Bell System for granted. Little 
do they realize what it takes to answer 
some two and a half million questions 
during a normal day.
Of course it takes operators : : : over 
12,000 highly skilled "Information 
operators.
But, in addition, it takes a staff of 
trained executive personnel.
They plan this service for cities and 
towns across the country so that "Infor
mation can quickly find the latest 
listings of the many telephones within 
her areafrom records that are brought 
up to date daily. And it is they who 
study operating methods and equipment 
in the never-ending search to make this 
service ever faster, ever better.
Is it any wonder that today, more than 
ever before, management is interested 
in young men with imagination and am
bition : : : men to develop with the 
industry? .

During the following three 
years, Carnegie Tech, like hun
dreds of other colleges and uni
vers'ties, underwent difficult 
times. The majority of male stu
dents were in uniform, and class
rooms were converted to suit gov
ernment needs. The Scotch and 
Soda Club fell into a dormant 
stage, and thus remained until the 
Spring of 1946. At that time Dan
ny Franks and Helen Miller, to
gether with many others, wiped 
away the cobwebs and produced a 
snappy little show, Take It From 
Here, in the college gymnasium. 
The idea behind the show was to 
re-establish interest in the reac
tivation of the club so that the 
following year the students would 
be able to produce a musical com
parable to those presented before 
the war.

Since work on a Scotch and 
Soda production is closely affil
iated with some phases of the 
educational work in the depart
ments of music and drama, plans 
are being formulated to allow 
academic credit to the members 
of these departments who partici
pate in future shows.
Jim Boyce and other members 
of Scotch and Soda are at pres
ent completing the reorganization 
of the club by revising its consti
tution and preparing for this 
years show.
Soon after midsemesters the 
first call for prospective partici
pants in the 1947 show will be 
made. From then on all efforts of 
Scotch and Soda will be concen
trated on its first post-war pro
duction.
