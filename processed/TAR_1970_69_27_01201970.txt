C-MU students may go on record as the first ones ever 
to throw marshmallows at a U.S. Senator. The target of a 
handful of vociferous antagonists in the audience in the 
Skibo Ballroom was the Republican Senator from South 
Carolina. Strom Thurmond, who spoke here on Tuesday. 
Jan. 20. The Senator survived the barrage and later said. 
"I've never seen anything like it.
The first speaker on the schedule of the Activities 
Board of distinguished lecturers, the Senator spoke to an 
audience which was determined to hear him despite fre
quent interruptions by persistant detractors. Senator 
Thurmond spoke on topics ranging from electoral reforms 
to welfare and did not fail to demonstrate why he is called 
The Perfect Conservative by the Americans for Con
stitutional Action.
On military spending he stressed the need for contin
ued military preparedness as long as the "Dictators in 
the Kremlin pursue their goal of world domination. 
Speaking about President Nixon and the war in Vietnam 
the Senator defended the administrations policies blam
ing previous Presidents for increasing U.S. involvement 
to the extent that only gradual withdrawal is now feasible. 
If previous administrations had acted accordingly, the 
Vietnam war could have been ended in six months, the 
Senator said. Shouts of End the War interrupted his de
fense of President Nixon whom he described as doing the 
best he can to bring an honorable end to the war.
Laughter and more heckling greeted his remark that 
welfare should be administered to people who are willing 
to take training. Through training, welfare recipients can 
get jobs and get off welfare.
The Senator s remark on big government being the 
biggest threat to freedom elicited mixed reactions from 
those who were aware of his unsuccessful campaign for 
the Presidency in 1948 as a States' Right candidate and 
from those who are reminded of the trial of Bobby Seale 
and the Chicago Seven.
Senator Thurmond did not appear disturbed by the 
few hecklers in a crowd of 500 but made frequent refer
ence during his talk to an opening remark that he favored 
"dissent but I think it is a disgrace to allow a handful of 
people to disrupt a meeting just as I think it is a disgrace 
tor a handful of radicals to disrupt the opportunity of 
others to get an education in our colleges today.

The housing shortage at Carnegie-Mellon University 
could reach critical proportions by 1975. This is the pro
jection of the User's Committee for Planning New Cam
pus Housing based on the enrollment estimates of Drs. 
Kibbee and Schatz.
The report was delivered last Monday to the Trus
tee's Committee on Student Affairs. The User s Commit
tee was initiated by the Trustees and organized through 
the Division of Student Affairs following requests by stu
dents for accelerated planning.
Represented on the committee are all segments of 
the campus community, five undergraduates (two AWS. 
two MDC. one student senate), two graduate students 
(one representing married students). Dean Milligan. 
Dean Williams. Ernest Holt (director of Housing). Rob
ert Steward (co-ordinator of Physical Planning). James 
Kerr (director of Physical Plant). Dr. Tommy Broadwa
ter (faculty representative). Dr. Robert Kibbee and Dr. 
Robert Morgan.

Last Tuesday evening's Student Senate meeting dealt 
with several items of new business. First, however. Joe 
Duckworth made a report on the activities of the commit
tee established to study the drafting of a new Campus 
Code. This committee, composed of three students, three 
faculty, and Dean Swank, came into existence when it was 
felt that there was a need for reform of the campus dis
ciplinary processes. The students had hoped that all par
ties concerned would be amenable to the formation of a 
single disciplinary body composed of students as well as 
faculty and administration. Duckworth told the Senate, 
however, that the faculty had been unwilling to submit to 
any trial system involving students. This left open the pos
sibility that parallel disciplinary bodies would be estab
lished. making students responsible to students, faculty 
members to faculty, and so on.
The first item of new business involved a motion on 
the part of Tom Morrison to freeze the budget of the re
cent campus publication The Relative Truth. His general 
objection was that the paper was in poor taste and that it 
gave only one side of the political picture. Another sena
tor countered that his dismay with The Relative Truth re
sulted not from its offensiveness but from the poor jour
nalistic quality of the articles. One senator who had been 
involved in the publication of the paper reminded the Sen
ate that the policy of the publication was to accept any ar
ticle from any student, as long as it was clear, and re
gardless of political standpoint. Coupled with Joe Duck
worth's unwillingness to set a precedent of censorship, 
the motion was defeated.
The next item dealt again with the Campus Code 
Having learned of the facultys refusal to be disciplined by 
a body of which students were a part, Steve Rosenberg 
read a motion declaring that the students support the no
tion of parallel judicial systems for faculty and students 
and which reasserted that all non-academic discipline of 
students be conducted by students. Since the community 
discipline notion had already been rejected, the motion 
carried 26-4-6.
A motion was then heard on whether to add a day to 
next Aprils Easter holiday, or simply add Easter Mon
day and drop another day. This action would prevent stu
dents from having to travel on Easter Sunday. Dean Swank 
pointed out that calendar changes were very difficult this 
late in the year and the motion was subsequently amend
ed into the form of a suggestion This passed 23-6-5.
The next item of business involved a plea on the part 
of Dean Swank for the Student Senate to watch its own 
budget for next year very carefully. He described the 
schools financial situation as being somewhat precari
ous at the moment and stressed the need for careful plan
ning in the development of the new budget.
One motion, to appropriate $80 to bring The Group, a 
company of amateur actors to the C-MU campus, and an
other. on budget procedures, were tabled to committee. 
At this time Chairman Pat Cavanagh appointed an ad hoc

LETTERS TO THE EDITOREditorial
Senator Strom Thurmond would have proved to be foolish 
by his speech and on his record. Unfortunately, several students 
felt they must help him. Thus, with the aid of marshmallows 
and heckling they succeeded in disrupting the lecture and an
noying the majority of listeners. Arguing, if one may call Tues
days display that, by noise and command only demonstrates 
that the ability to use reason is weak.
There have been several ramifications of the demonstra
tion. Senator Thurmond, for one, probably left C-MU re-con
firming his belief in the necessity of federal control over the 
disruption of University campuses. He and some others who wit
nessed the lecture came away with the opinion that the Left 
was hypocritical; that student radicals displayed undemocratic 
conduct in support of democracy, perverted free speech in sup
port of that guaranteed right. Members of the University com
munity in discussion and debate clouded the real issue of Thur
monds philosophy and actions by arguing about the tactics used 
to demonstrate differences. In addition, many mass media pub
lications have used this episode as only another in the long 
stream of examples to prove the irrationality and irresponsibil
ity of the intellectual elite.
Thurmonds appearance here had no educational value. Cer
tainly, no one entered the Ballroom thinking that he could change 
the Senators attitude; certainly the Senator could not believe 
that he would strongly influence ours. If the purpose of his lec
ture was to present another point of view, that too failed. For, 
not only did we not listen but he did not present any new or dif
ferent perspective to the views of the Right. His speech was 
spiked with warn-out phrases and inane logic. Who here could 
believe in the Senators definition Or interpretation of inflation? 
Unfortunately, Thurdmonds faulty arguments and opinions pro
cured more sympathy than good arguments put forth roughly, 
insolently, and noisily.
The University as a place where free discussion and flow of 
ideas can occur may be an admirable conception. But this epi
sode and others have indicated that it is not a fact of life. Sadly, 
students have arrived at the point where they no longer believe 
they are being heard. They, therefore, believe in turn they need 
not listen. Abbie Hoffman and Doctor Spock may receive stand
ing ovations no matter how dull or unintelligible their arguments 
may be. The point is that they agree with us, they are part of 
the movement.
If the campus mood will not permit those who present op
posing views to appear, those who want to hear those views will 
have to get them elsewhere. There is simply no benefits to bring
ing a man here only to be ridiculed and silenced.
Perhaps there is alternative. The Senator represents to 
many the oppressive and repressive forces present in America. 
He represents all that many consider bad. It was not only what 
he said, but what he stands for and how he defends himself, that 
brought such violent opposition. Perhaps what we should aim 
for now in bringing different views to the University is people 
who can defend their beliefs intelligently, without the connota
tions which Senator Thurmons name evokes.
Would William Buckley have provoked the same response?

Editor. The Tartan:
The purpose of my writing this 
letter is to express my views con
cerning the peace and speech-lov
ing students on this campus. Their 
performance at the lecture by 
Senator Strom Thurmond showed 
the complete ignorance and hypo
crisy of these students.
On Saturday. Jan. 17. there was 
a program on Political Repres
sion which was wholeheartedly 
supported by the above-mention
ed students. The program went 
under the catchy slogan of Give 
Speech a Chance. " It seems to me 
this slogan is applied by these stu
dents to only particular situations.
When I went to the program on 
Saturday I saw no American Le
gionnaires shouting down or 
throwing marshmallows (or any
thing else for that matter) at the 
speakers. So I see no reason why 
Senator Strom Thurmond should 
be subjected to such conditions.
While I myself do not parti
cularly agree with the Senator I 
do believe he does have a right to 
speak his views.
Carnegie-Meilon University 
owes an apology to the Senator for 
the disgraceful actions on the part 
of the free speechers.

Editor. The Tartan:
For the past several semesters 
concerned students in the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences have 
attempted to discover and under
stand the reasons for the adminis
tration's apparent negligence with 
respect to our department. After 
considerable investigation we 
found few. it any. concrete rea
sons for this attitude.
Dr. Schatz. who is the vice pres
ident for academic affairs, said 
that it was his feeling that our de
partment was not of superior cali
ber and was not as influential as 
some other departments, and 
therefore must be given the axe. 
We contend that this attitude is 
not exemplary of a University 
vice president. The treatment of 
our department does not show the 
expected broad minded endeavors 
of a University.
When we asked what we could 
do to maintain and promote the 
growth of our department, we 
were told to show them that there 
was a campus interest in Biology . 
This we didin the General Bio
logy courses alone last semester 
we had approximately 100 stu
dents and there were over 30 ap
plications for graduate work for 
this year which had to be refused. 
Apparently this doesn't impress 
the administrators, for admis
sion to the department is still 
closed.
We are now at a loss as to what 
action should be taken and would 
greatly appreciate any sugges
tions from the campus commun
ity concerning this matter

Easter is March 29. It should be 
immediately clear to even a cas

will all have to back in Pittsburgh 
on Easter afternoon or evening.
Horrors! A large percentage of 
C-MU students will have to spend 
Easter on the road, in the air. or 
even worse, in the dorms! It is 
not immediately obvious to me 
why this confounding error was 
made, and I suspect it is an error, 
forcing many students to miss 
Easter at home. Easter dinner is.
of course, an important occasion 
in many families, time for seeing 
relatives, etc.
So. President Stever. why did 
you do this to us? Wouldn't sched
uling spring recess from March 
27 to April 5 be easier all around? 
(This would give us the same num
ber of days off. delaying spring

too much to ask? Anxiously await

ter was sent to Senator Thurmond.)
Dear Sir:
We are students at CarnegieMeilon University, and attended 
your lecture this morning. Jan
uary 20. 1970. Although we found 
ourselves in opposition to a great 
many of the views you expressed, 
we feel compelled to apologize for 
the actions of those among us who. 
apprarently unable to form intelli
gent. well reasoned criticism and 
questions, resorted to juvenile 
bellowing composed largely of 
empty phrases and shallow slo
gans. We consider their words and 
actions a corruption of the right of 
dissent.
In times when one's very exis
tence seems threatened by war. 
pollution, and economic turmoil, 
when debate ceases to be academ
ic and becomes a matter of sur
vival. perhaps reason is destin
ed to be lost. However, it is appar

bacle that little can be resolved 
through insensible emotional out
burst.
Again, our regrets.

Tuesday I sat through a disgust
ing assembly during which the 
guest speaker was bombarded 
with marshmallows. I was appal
led by the actions of a few of those 
present who proceeded to disrupt 
the assembly in any and every 
way possible. A U.S. Senator and 
guest at this school was subject
ed to ridicule which had no other 
purpose than to interrupt him.
I personally am getting damn 
sick and tired of being embar
rassed and harassed by the few 
revolutionary nuts at this school 
who seize every opportunity to 
make a spectacle out of them
selves under the guise of anti-war 
protest and academic freedom.
To avoid any future embarrass
ments I submit that the adminis
tration should recognize that they 
are dealing with immature chil
dren and treat them as such In 
my opinion. ID s should be check
ed to make sure only students at
tend programs where an occur
ence like this is likely, and also, 
that campus police be present at 
such programs to remove those 
who disrupt the program.
I am perfectly willing to put up 
with this added inconvenience if I 
will be able to enjoy a program in 
peace, instead of listening to SDS 
propoganda which I hear too often 
as it is.

Concerning the comparative 
conduct of Senator Thurmon with 
some of the audience attending his 
speech: Senator Thurmon spoke 
with an accent, and with, at times, 
seemingly faulty logic. His con
clusions were not generally pala
table. but he spoke what he felt. 
A portion of the audience, how
ever. if actions are indicators of 
true feelings, did not share Sena
tor Thurmon's philosophy, speak
ing what one feels. The fantastic 
pretenders revealed themselves, 
showing their fangs while froth
ing about peace and freedom. Per
haps they should be called effete 
snobs frothing peace.
Maybe I am wrong, though, and 
these people are not hypocrites at 
all. Maybe they are fools and do 
not know the meaning of the words 
they so freely use. I do not. of 
course, speak of the large num

The amiss was even more amiss than usual the 
day Richard J. Daley acted his hours in the court 
room of the Conspiracy Sevenin the court room of 
the seven men who were assigned responsibility 
for the outbursts that accompanied Chicagos 1968 
National Democratic convention. Richard J. Daley, 
defense witness 42., was fascinatingly executed. A 
near-perfect non-drama from beginning to end.
When he glided into U.S. District Judge Julius 
J. Hoffmans chambers, it became apparent that 
Daley holds more than mere honorary claim to the 
position of Chicagos principle character. In court, 
he lived up to his reputation. He was both controlled 
and in control throughout the day.
Since Daley was subpoenaed by the defense as 
a defense witness, it was the perogative of only the 
prosecution to pose "leading' questions. In order 
to get at essential issues, the defendants had 
hoped to use the legal technicality of having their 
own witness declared hostile. When a witness is 
declared hostile, the side who called the witness 
is free to pose "leading questions. Judge Hoffman, 
who termed Daley "a most friendly witness. would 
not. and, of course, did not declare Daley "hostile.
Daley glided into the court room; without paus
ing for trumpets to herald his presence, he glided 
past the chain cord which had separated spectators 
from participants. Without pausing to prostrate 
himself before the judge, he defiantly glided to the 
witness stand. Without waiting for the edict, he 
stood with his right hand perched in the air. Daley 
was ready and able for his public performance.
Perhaps as memorable as his dramatically undramatic entrance was the rest of his casually rig
id performance as defense witness number 42. He 
came off not as such a pig. but more as motionless, 
normal witness number 42. His since boyhood 
friendship with the prosecuting attorney was un
derplayed. The fact that he appoints all key Chicago 
officials except those who are appointed by Daley 
appointees was skimmed over. The fact that he has 
been Chicagos mayor since 1955 was hurriedly 
passed by. He became such a normal, soft-spoken 
witness that the judge several times had to ask him 
to speak up.
When he finished bearing his soul to the de
fense. testifying to being mayor of the city of Chi
cago. leader of the Cook Cojnty Democratic Com
mittee and "proud of it and explaining that he 
thinks prosecution attorney Foran is one of the 
greatest attorneys in this country and the finest 
man I have met in private and public life. Daley 
answered the two questions posed by the prosecu
tion. To Foran's inquiry about whether the mayor
ever suggested that march and park permits be 
denied in August of 1968. Daley said. No. To 
the prosecutions, "Did you tell anyone when the 
YIPPIES and the Mobilization filed their suits, now 
they'll never get permits. Daley also answered. 
"No. And those, apparently, are the only things 
Daley had been prepared to say.
When Daley didnt seem anxious to answer a 
question, he didnt open his mouth. Foram wouldi 
immediately object to the question and quickly be 
sustained.
The drama took place after a series of building 
moments. After the defense accused Daley of pack
ing the public part of the spectators section with 
his own people. After Judge Hoffman refused to poll 
the public section to ascertain whether or not the 
defense claim had any basis. It happened when Da
ley and at least 20 federal marshals, simultaneous
ly glided into the court room. Afther that, a mar
shall heard a spectator hiss. Instantaneouslyeven 
before the jury could be ordered to leaveseven 
"marshals surrounded the perpetrater of the 
noise. The "marshals weren't overly careful to 
avoid bumping and stepping on spectators. Specta
tors rebelled bv saying. "It's Chicago all over 
again.
The comedy took place quite abruptly. Before 
the jury returned from luncheon recess, things 
were on the usual state of informal confusion. "Con
spirator Abbie Hoffman spotted "power wielder 
Richard Daley. Hoffman saw Daley and said. Hey. 
let's settle this right now ... me and you . . . It 
was like a revelation to Daley. He laughed. He for
got for a second. For a second he seemed to relate 
to Abbie Hoffman. Or at least to his language. As 
usual, the ban on laughter was issued.
Dalev had at least one dramtic trick up his 
sleeve. When the defense listed what it had hoped to 
prove had it been given the chance to ask "leading 
questions. Daley didn't answer. He didnt respond 
when Kuntsler said there had been a conspiracy be
tween Mayor Daley and the Democratic adminis
tration of Lyndon Johnson to prevent any signifi
cant demonstration against "war, poverty, impperialism. racism. He didn't respond when Kuntsler 
accused him of obtaining and maintaining power in 
Chicago by the creation and maintenance of a cor
rupt political machine. He didn't respond when 
Kuntsler talked about Mayor Daley's April 15. 1968, 
order to his police to shoot to kill arsonist and to 
shoot to main or cripple looters in the Black com
munity. He didnt respond when the defense accus
ed Mayor Daley and his administrators of victim
izing and harrassing for years members of both the 
Black and the young community. Defense witness 
number 42 used silence as his controlling cue.

Senate Passes 
2 Motions On 
Judicial Codes
At the Tuesday meeting of Stu
dent Senate the following actions 
were taken:
1. A motion, recognizing the 
right of free speech, censuring 
those students who had not the 
common sense or courtesy to al
low Senator Thurmond to speak 
without heckling and interrup
tion. was passed 23-3-4. A roll 
call vote was taken.
2. A motion calling the alloca
tion of $2,487.50 to the Relative 
Truth a gross mistake and call
ing for the corrective actions of
1.) freezing their budget; b.) re
moving any unspent money and 
placing it in a reserve for any 
other student organizations, and 
c. i make public a detailed account 
of all funds transacted by the or
ganization. was defeated 5-23-3.
3. A motion stating the Senates 
opinion that: a.) all non-academic 
disciplinary procedures concern
ing students should be adminis
tered by students only; b.) nonacademic disciplinary regulations 
and procedures should rest only 
with those members of the aca
demic community affected by 
these regulations and procedures 
and supporting the principle of 
parallel judicial systems for stu
dents and faculty and recognizing 
the importance of due process in 
all campus disciplinary procedrues. was passed 26-4-6.
4 A motion was passed (28-0-2) 
directing President Duckworth 
and Chairman Cavanagh to indi
cate that the intent of the above 
motion is to make a compromise 
of the Senates principles as stat
ed in that and previous motions so 
that a workable campus code can 
be quickly developed. Passage of 
the above motion is not intended 
to indicate a modification of the 
Senates basic stance towards a 
campus code stated in previous 
motions. We will continue to 
work towards those goals in the 
long run, the motion stated
5. A motion passed (23-5-6) rec
ommending to the Educational Po
licy Council that either an extra 
day be added onto Easter vacation 
or that an earlier day be dropped 
and added onto the end of the va
cation, in order that students not 
be forced to travel during Easter 
Day.

pus housing through a study of 
available literature on the subject, 
emphasizing qualitiative aspects 
of student living. Individual com
mittee members developed sur
veys and questionnaires to ana
lyze the preference of various 
constitutencies.
Recognizing both the financial 
problems of all construction and 
those specific limitations of fed
eral asistance which have given 
us such facilities as Donner and 
Hammerschlag Halls, the com
mittee invited Richard Strathmeyer, vice president for Business 
Affairs, to discuss these matters. 
Options in ownership and financong the impact of present inter
est rates and both the sources and 
allocation priorities of University 
funds were considered.
The committee has been meet
ing regularly since Oct. 16, 1969. 
In its final report, to be present
ed by May 1. the committee hopes 
to resolve such issues as the much 
increased desire for apartmentstyle units, techniques for influ
encing large-scale private devel
opment of student housing in Oak
land and the particularly critical 
finances of graduate, married and 
financial aid students.
Although the surveys thus far 
completed have revealed signifi

committee to study student rep
resentation on the Board of Trus

Finally, but not inconsequential
ly. a motion called the Free 
Speech Resolution was read. Part 
of the resolution read:
We. the Student Senate . . . 
show our disapproval of the stu
dent instigators during the recent 
visit of Senator Strom Thurmond. 
We hereby publicly censure those 
students who had not the common 
sense or courtesy to allow Sena
tor Thurmond to speak without 
heckling and interruption.
A fair amount of discussion en
sued and Senator Tom Burgess, 
who had been a part of the heckling group, defended the inter
ruptions as a political action, the 
Junction of which was to make it 
clear to Senator Thurmond that 
even on a small inconspicuous 
campus such as ours that opposi
tion to his policies is great. The 
resolution, however, was passed

World's greatest living pantomimist, Marcel Marceau, is seen 
to the left as the loveable "Bip"the character which he created 
in 1947 to symbolize in the "art of silence" the foibles and fancies 
of human beings. Bip's misadventures will form, with Marceau's 
famous style pantomimes, a program which is offered by Activities 
Board on Feb. 18 at Syria Mosque as part of his seventh American 
tour.

Strom Affair 
A Tragedy
by Chuck Daly
Two points must be made with 
regard to Senator Strom Thur
monds talk of Jan. 20. For those 
who did not attend. I must say that 
the entire spectacle was a tragedy 
which needn't have happened. One 
might easily have place the scene 
as that of an elementary school af
ter a long day of unstimulating 
classes. I never, up until Tuesday, 
had suspected that our education
al system had been such a grave 
failure in its attempts to encour
age the development of a critical 
mind.
A sizable portion of the blame 
for the failure of the program 
must go to both the Activities 
Board and Senator Thurmond. 
Thurmond presented neither any 
original thoughts on the current 
political scene nor any rationale 
behind the views he holds. He 
merely re-stated views that an in
terested party might find in any 
current periodical. Senator Thur
mond should have realized this 
and given us something which we 
might be willing to listen to even 
though we might not agree with it. 
But this has been a common fail
ure of this years Activities Board.
The only speaker who present
ed anything relatively original 
was Arthur Schlesinger. The 
others merely recapitulated facts 
which any well-informed citi
zen should be aware of. I was cri
ticized for my negative rhetoric 
on Werner von Braun. Werner did
nt tell me anything new. Neither 
did Strom Thurmond. Neither pos
sessed sufficient magnetism to 
bring to my knees in adulation.
But the young anarchist who 
continually interrupted the talk 
might wonder why Thurmond. Agnew and others threaten repres
sion of your actions. It is because 
of you, gentlemen. I would venture 
that you would react similarity if 
placed in the same position. You 
claim to seek a better world but 
your actions dont bear that out. 
You ask for freedom of speech, 
but wouldnt let Thurmond speak. 
You profess love, but I only saw 
hate. Perhaps we need a revolu
tion. but not yours. Before you de
stroy the Establishment. I sug
gest you offer something positive 
in its place besides your contra
dicted virtues.
"And is you want money for people
with minds that hate,
"Well all I can tell you is 'Brother,
you'll have to wait.

Lost & Found, 
See Security
The Repression Program of 
Saturday had at least one immedi
ate result. The campus YM-YWCA 
found itself under fire for their 
support of the program.
The campus office and the met
ropolitan offices of both groups 
received calls from members who 
felt the action was inappropriate 
for the "Y." Freedom of speech, 
in their thinking, did not extend 
to people who oppose the Ameri
can way of life and advocate rev
olution. Several stated that they 
would never again contribute to 
the Community Chest, which sup
ports Y activities.
On Friday morning, the day 
prior to the program, the metro
politan YMCA office received a 
phone calll from a member of the 
American Brothers Committee, a 
veterans group. The caller threat
ened that unless the Y withdrew 
its backing, his group would take 
out full-page advertisements in 
the Pittsburgh papers exposing 
the Y as un-American and advis
ing veterans to no longer support 
it.
The staffs of the metropolitan Y 
reaffiremed the rectitude of C-MU 
Y's actions. The C-MU Ys' played 
a valuable supportive role on Sat
urday. On Monday morning the 
representative of the American 
Brothers called, denounced the 
Saturday affair as filthy, and an
nounced the committees intention 
to carry out their threat. District 
29 of the VFW7 also called and an
nounced that they too would take 
action, apparently at the Broth
er's prompting.
The Y offices are now awaiting 
further development in the con
troversy.
Xerox:
For engineers 
who think 
of more than 
engineering.
There's one in every crowd. A Doug King, 
who'd rather do something than talk 
about it. By vocation, Doug's a Manager 
(Test Engineering) for Xerox. By avocation, 
a teacher of functional illiterates. By 
instinct, an unabashed do-gooder. "I ust 
feel that if one person can be effective 
Editto effectiveit's better than 100 
people sitting in a meeting."
The wish being father to the deed, Doug 
involved himself in inner-city programs 
and Rochester's Business Opportunities 
Operation. Doug teaches adults with less 
than a sixth grade education to readon 
a 1 -to-1 basis, just teacher and pupil. He 
went about this in the same professional 
way he tackles his daily work. He first took 
a course in how to become a teacher.
Now, he's training fledgling instructors.
On the business side, one of the persons 
under his wing had never been anything 
more than a janitor. Doug helped him 
secure a franchise from a national rugcleaning company. It's successful, too. As 
Doug puts it: "For the first time in his life, 
this fellow finally has a stake in something. 
And he knows if he needs help or advice, 
it's there for the asking."
Doug also benefits from his avocation. For 
one thing, he's more patient. More 
understanding of society's so-called 
problem children. He knows why they are 
what they areand what they can be.
At Xerox, we like people like Doug King. 
Engineers who can see beyond 
engineering. Engineers who can feel for 
humanity. Engineers who seek additional 
outlets for their talents.
If you're this kind of engineer, we'd like 
to talk to you. Your degree in Engineering 
or Science may qualify you for some 
intriguing openings in a broad spectrum 
of developmental and manufacturing 
areas.
We're located in suburban Rochester, 
New York. See your Placement Director 
for a copy of our brochure and for the 
date of our scheduled campus interviews.

Plans February Conference
Despite the October and November anti-war demonstrations, the war continues. Very few people have 
confidence in the peace talks. Despite Nixon's token withdrawals. American GIs continue to be slaughtered.
In an effort to revive the peace movement, the Student Mobilization Committee will hold a national 
conference at Case Western Reserve University the weekend of Feb. 13. 14 and 15. Over 1.500 students. GIs, 
and anti-war activists are expected from every part of the country to gather to discuss together where the 
antiwar movement should go. Information may be obtained from the SMC. 2102 Eculid Avenue. Cleveland. 
Ohio 44115.
The massive October and No
vember demonstrations showed 
the tremendous strength of the 
anti-war movement by involving 
over a million Americans in de
manding that Nixon bring all the 
GIs home now. Sessions are being 
scheduled not only to debate pro
posals for future anti-war actions, 
but workshops and panels will be 
held on a wide range to topics, 
from women's liberation and the 
fight against the war. to GI and 
high school organizing, to the in
ternational anti-war movement.
The Student Mobilization Com
mittee to End the War in Vietnam 
is the national organization of all 
high school and college students 
who are united in uncompromis
ing struggle against the war.
The program of the Committee 
is for the immediate and uncondi
tional withdrawal of ALL U.S. 
forces from Vietnam; for an end 
to the draft; against all forms of 
campus complicity with the war; 
self-determination for Vietnam 
and black America; free speech 
for GIs and hiigh school students.

GSIA Joins 
Nine Schools 
To Aid Blacks
The Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration (GSIAi has joined 
nine other leading graduate 
schools of management in a con
certed effort to increase the flow 
of black and other minority per
sons into significant managerial 
positions.
The ten schools have formed the 
Council for Opportunity in Grad
uate Management Education, 
which seeks to increase the 
awareness of minority group 
members of the relevance of Mas
ter's programs as the link be
tween undergraduate college ex
perience and careers in manage
ment. The Council has received a 
grant of $1,000,000 from the Al
fred P. Sloan Foundation to sus
tain its first year operation.
According to Richard M. Cyert. 
dean of GSIA, "The existence of 
the Council will broaden the base 
of dinancial support for minority 
students through a program of 
graduate fellowships. It will also 
help the participating schools sus
tain and strengthen their present 
programs for minority students."
The GSIA dean cited a recent 
survey of 15 graduate manage
ment schools which disclosed that 
only 2.5 per cent of the nearly 8.- 
000 students were black and that 
other minorities were even more 
poorly represented.
Some of the efforts planned bv 
GSIA of which are already under
way are:
Move as quickly as possible to 
achieve a minimum 10 per 
cent black representation in the 
Master of Science program.
Cooperation with the National 
Scholarship Service Foundation 
for Negro Students . to recruit 
black studentswith back
grounds in mathematics and 
physical sciences necessary to 
a candidate's success at GSIA. 
This effort has been in effect for 
two years.
Visits to Southern campuses 
with predominantly black en
rollments. Alphonse Whitfield, 
an alumnus of GSIA and mana
ger of the electric vehicle de
partment of Westinghouse Elec
tric Corp.. and two black stu
dents at GSIA. Eric Mitchell 
and William Baitev. have been 
working with GSIA faculty 
members in this area. This ef
fort has been going on for two 
years also.

Pag 10THE TARTANFriday, January 23, 1970
It is hard to believe that a group such as the Jam Fac
tory with their many TV appearances and nationwide con
certs. its enjoying such widespread popularity without yet 
having released their first LP, due Jan. 20 on EPIC.
Living up to their name, the Jam Factory (two guitar
ists, an organist, a drummer, a trombonist, and a trump
eter) evokes the unfettered spirit of a jam session, though 
their act is well prepared and does not inclue improvisa
tion.
The New York based group is truly a musicians 
band. In characterizing the group this way. a meaningful 
distinction is made. Most rock bands have as their most 
important goal a determination to "make it and there 
are equally as many conceptions of how to go about be
coming popular as there are groups. The essential differ
ence between a musicians band and a non-musician's band 
reflect important differences in point of view. The latter 
point of view develops from a fundamental audience ori
entation while the former one stems from an orientation 
in which emphasis is placed on the creation of music.
Through their arrangements, primarily rock and 
blues with a jazz influence, the Jam Factory makes in
teresting use of tonal and textual contrasts. Their basic 
instrumentation (trombone, organ, trumpet, guitar and 
bass) allows a great deal of flexibility. Leader Earl Ford, 
formerly with Buddy Rich and Otis Redding, doubles on 
baritone. Gene McCormick doubles on tenor sax. trump
eter Steve Marcone doubles on vibes and various Latin 
percussion instruments, bassist Kent Detelic doubles on 
trumpet, guitarist Mark Hoffman doubles on bass, and 
drummer Joe English provides the core.
Outstanding in their repetoire are two originals by 
the Jam Factory's organist-arranger Gene McCormick. 
One is "Tight Knit Group"; the other is "Lets Make It 
Workboth reflecting an important part of what the 
Jam Factory is all about: internal brotherhood and co
operation.
Other arrangements, featured by the Jam Factory 
and indicating their versatility include "Groovin Is Easy 
by Bloomfield's Electric Flag. "Sing a Simple Song'' and
"Everyday People by Sly and the Family Sone. "Can't 
Quit Her by Blood. Sweat and Tears. "People Get 
Ready by the Chambers' Brothers, and "Ticket to Ride.
All the compositions show a variety of references, 
but primarily to BS&T and Sly. They also show a strong 
big band influence characterized by dramatic "kicks and 
endings.
The Jam Factory has talent, versatility and original
ity. They have a sense of on-stage oneness that cannot be 
overemphasized. Where some groups fall short in live 
performances, the Jam Factory is adequately equipped to 
turn out any house.
The Jam Factory presents a very exciting experience. 
They will perform in the Skibo Ballroom Friday. Jan. 30. 
at 8:30 p.m.. marking the first in a series of spring semes
ter concerts presented by the Activities Board. Tickets 
($1.50) will be available in Baker Hall and at the Skibo 
Information Desk.
Dont miss the Jam Factory. It is a tight knit group 
which will broaden your sense of musical possibilities.
