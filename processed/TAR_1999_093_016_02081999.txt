In a January 21 meeting, Student Sen
ate passed a resolution forming a com
mittee to investigate the actions of the 
Student Body Treasurer, senior electri
cal and computer engineeringmajor Keith 
Rothschild. The resolution was in part 
the result of a January 19 meeting, in 
which discussions of Rothschilds actions 
took place, according to Senate minutes.
Charles Anthe, senior electrical and 
computer engineering major and vice 
chair for Student Senate, proposed the 
resolution (S99-002). The committee, 
which Senators have referred to as 
a Special Committee to Investigate 
the Actions of the Student Body Trea
surer, or the Powers of the Treasurer 
Special Investigation Committee, 
will reportedly inquire into Rothschilds 
actions to determine if misconduct oc
curred. Student Body President Sarah 
Gross brought reported allegations 
to the Senates attention at the January 
19 meeting.
The committee was formed because 
of a number of rumors and complaints 
that the Student Body Treasurer was 
abusing his power, said Mike Strauss, 
senior computer science major and 
senator for SCS. There was a discus
sion [in the meeting] about whether they 
were true or not. In the meeting we came 
to the conclusion that we didnt know 
whether he was abusing his power or 
he was using his power. A lot of treasur
ers in the past havent used it, so its 
hard to tell.
Strauss is reportedly the head of the 
five-member committee, which will make 
a formal, public report of its findings on 
February 18.
This committee is not designed to 
gather dirt or reflect negatively on the 
actions of the Treasurer, said Anthe. It 
is designed to collect information, assess 
it, and make a report to Student Senate. 
According to Rothschild, this year rep
resents a transition period for the twoyear-old position of Treasurer. This year, 
he said, is the first year where anyone 
has made an effort to enforce the rules, 
particularly those that pertain to stu
dent organizations.
Ive audited every student organiza
tion, said Rothschild. Sometimes people 
may feel that Ive been mean. Often 
times they dont know what Im doing 
with other student organizations, 
and they feel that Im overly clamping 
down on them. As a rule I dont report 
to [all of] Senate. A number of Senators 
have said theyd like to be kept more 
up to date.
Rothschild pointed out that much of the 
investigation will serve as an evaluation 
on the past year, not on his personal 
actions. The Constitution of the Student 
Body, for example, grants him the power 
to freeze a student organizations budget, 
but not to require the student organiza
tion to meet with him. Rothschild encour
aged Senate to proceed with the investiga
tion by sending a letter to the executive 
committee detailing some ofthe complaints 
and offeringhis resignation if they deemed 
it necessary.

Paul Mellon, one ofthe greatest Ameri
can philanthropists of this century and 
a primary reason that Carnegie Mellon 
University contains the Mellon in its 
name, died last Monday at his home in 
Upperville, Va. at age 91.
Mellon was born at the present-day 
site of the University Center, on June
11, 1907.
I was born about sixty feet above 
Skibo Hall. It was not because my 
mother was in a balloon, but because 
our house stood on a hill which has 
only recently been bulldozed away. 
So, in a sense, this is a happy home
coming for me, he said in the 1967 
Carnegie Institute of Technology com
mencement address.
That year, Carnegie Tech and the 
Mellon Institute, which was originally 
founded by Paul Mellons father An
drew Mellon, merged to become the 
University it is today.
Paul Mellon, who was at that time 
the chairman of the board of trustees 
at the Mellon Institute, was instru
mental in the decision to merge with 
Carnegie Tech.
I felt strongly that developments in 
the scientific field pointed toward the 
necessity of a closer relationship with, 
or even absorption by, a university, 
he said in his 1992 autobiography, 
Reflections in a Silver Spoon. Despite 
its long history of having been under 
the wing of the University of Pitts
burgh, it was obvious to our scientific 
advisers and me that the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, being far bet
ter known and respected in most sci
entific circles, was the wiser choice.
According to Eric Johnson, vice presi
dent for Development, the Mellon fam
ily is responsible for more than $80 mil
lion in donations to the school. Of this, 
$60 million was donated as a result of 
the merger with Mellon Institute. The 
rest of the money came from gifts to the 
University by organizations related to 
Mellon and his family. In addition, 
Johnson said that there might be money 
that will come to the University 
as the result of settling Mellons estate. 
Most of the familys money that has 
come to the school has come through the 
Andrew W. Mellon foundation, which 
was formed by Paul Mellon and his sis
ter Alisa in 1941.
[Paul Mellons] particular emphasis 
[was] on the arts and humanities. CFA
and H&SS have been the primary re
cipients ofthe support from the Mellons, 
said Johnson.
Its his money that is financing the 
new theater, said Martin Prekop, dean 
of CFA. He added that Mellons money is 
part of an endowment that is used 
throughout the college to fund student 
activities and supplement extra costs in 
a variety of things.
During the past capital campaign, not 
the current one, Mellon generously be
queathed $15 million"10 to CFA, five to 
H&SS. This money has not yet been re
ceived, but will greatly enhance the endo w
ment, and therefore the range of activities, 
possible in H&SS. said Peter Steams, 
dean of H&SS.

know what ideas have potential 
to materialize. With regard to 
music, we are looking to possibly 
have different bands, ensembles 
of music performance majors, and 
DJs, he said. We want the at
mosphere to be very inviting and 
engaging, so having music that 
keeps energy flowing will 
be a must.
The tradition of the ball was 
first revived in 1981 after a pe
riod of many years. At that time, 
CFA, Student Activities, and Stu
dent Affairs all played a signifi
cant role in it.
It was very successful, said 
Anne Witchner of Student 
Activities. There was 
a lot of initiative on the part of 
CFA, and it made sense to bring 
together people across 
campus for this large-scale event. 
The ball occurred subsequently 
in 1983 and then again 
in 1985. In the latter year, Stu
dent Activities and Student Af
fairs had no involvement. There 
were a lot of problems with con
trol and damage to the 
building,Witchner said. CFA 
considered removing themselves 
from future coordination.
The ball did not take place again 
until 1990, when a sixth-year ar
chitecture student who had at
tended the 1985 ball as a firstyear organized student efforts. 
The one in 90 was excellent, 
said Witchner. [The student in 
charge] had a frame of reference. 
She knew what the Beaux Arts 
Ball was, and she understood 
the Universitys concerns and 
why the University had a right to 
be concerned.
You really need to have large 
committees working on it, said 
Barbara Anderson, a member 
of the drama faculty. Its a 
big organizing job both before 
and after.
Student Affairs worked 
with students to organize the balls

The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) 
continued its support for the Pittsburgh 
Supercomputing Center (PSC) by pro
viding a grant for $2.5 million. The funds 
will extend initial funding of $4.5 mil
lion that began in February of 1998.
The grant will allow the PSC to con
tinue its cooperation with the DoE, said 
Michael Schneider, PSC science writer. 
Much of the money will go towards 
human resources at the center.
The grant will continue DoE coopera
tion with the PSC through the end of the 
fiscal year that ends in September.
Many politicians worked on behalf of 
the PSC, including U.S. Senator Rick 
Santorum (R-Pennsylvania), and state 
representatives Mike Doyle (DSwissvale), John P. Murtha (DJohnstown), William Coyne (D-Pittsburgh), Ron Klink (D-Jeannette), and 
Frank Mascara (D-Charleroi).
Founded in 1986, the PSC is a joint 
collaboration between CMU, the 
University of Pittsburgh, and 
Westinghouse Electric Company and is 
supported by as the U.S. National Insti
tute of Health as well as the Common
wealth of Pennsylvania and corpora
tions in the private sector.
The PSC provides the nations fastest 
supercomputers, in addition to human 
resources to corporations, government 
agencies, and universities such as 
Westinghouse, the DoE, CMU, and the 
University of Pittsburgh who are often 
not financially capable of independently 
purchasing the costly computers, said 
Schneider. These computers are $10 to 
$20 million a piece, so the $2.5 million 
goes primarily to cover human resources.
One joint effort between CMU and the 
PSC is a project called STAR. The STAR 
team plans to build a large Major Detec
tor System to be installed at the Relativ
ists Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) being 
constructed at Brookhaven National 
Laboratory. The RHIC is an advanced 
particle accelerator that will be capable 
of crushing nuclei to produce an atmo
sphere where large amounts of energy 
are present. These conditions should be 
similar to the conditions present when 
the universe first came into existence.
The researchers hope to use the PSC to 
both simulate the collisions and also to 
ensure that proper analysis and datahandling for the information, which could 
be up to a petabyte each year, are in place 
when the RHIC is inaugurated. It is 
because of such successful current and 
many past projects that the DoE chose to 
support PSC, according to Schneider.Students plan long-awaited Beaux Arts Ball for next October

If current plans materialize, a 
group of students will hold the 
first Beaux Arts Ball since 1995 
next fall in the College of Fine 
Arts, its traditional location.
The student group, led 
by Caroline Zaczek, a sophomore 
art major, Brendan Pester, 
a sophomore in policy and 
management, and Sal Candela, 
a sophomore CFA transitional 
student, meets regularly 
on Tuesday nights. Candela 
started the effort when he first 
heard about previous balls from 
faculty in the School of Architec
ture. Next, he founded a 
bboard, assocs.beaux-arts, and 
posted there to gauge interest, as 
well as talking to friends both in 
CFA and outside of it, 
including Zaczek. Pester became 
interested as the special events 
chair of AB. Im hoping to go into
arts management, and it sounded 
like just the kind of event I want 
to put on, Pester said.
The people whove been com
ing to the meetings are really 
enthusiastic, and Im excited 
about this sparking interdiscipli
nary collaboration, said Candela.
The tentative date for the ball 
is October 19, and plans include 
the possibility of student art in
stallations and performances. 
The theme is going to be the 
millennium and the contrast be
tween two views of the future: 
utopian and distopian, said Sam 
Wheeler, a sophomore art major 
who is heading the committee for 
installation and performance art. 
Hopefully well get a lot of people 
with ideas.
Mike Beuselinck, a sophomore 
Bachelor of Humanities and Arts 
student, is responsible for orga
nizing the musical entertain
ment. The planning stage is the 
most difficult because we have to
in 1993 and 1995, which saw 
a lower attendance than 
previous years but 
fewer problems. The 
past few balls have 
been dry and very 
orderly. The absence of 
alcohol cut down on 
99.9 percent of the 
problems, said Cam
pus Police Sergeant 
Bill Ricci.
Security is one of the 
biggest issues, said 
Pester. Its been 
stressed to us so much 
that it needs to be a 
concern, and right now 
it looks like thats 
ing to take up our 
whole budget.
The student group is 
currently writing a 
constitution to gain 
recognition from Stu
dent Senate as an offi
cial organization, in The
much the same vein as those 
that exist for the planning and

King of Jordan dies; 
son takes his place
AMMAN, Jordan (AP)  King 
Hussein of Jordan, who became a key 
force for stability in the turbulent 
Middle East in more than four de
cades as ruler ofhis strategically placed 
nation, died on Sunday following a 
battle with cancer. He was 63.
Official Jordanian TV announced the 
death, showing a portrait of the king 
draped with the nations flag. In Amman, 
mosque loudspeakers began sounding 
verses from the Koran, the Muslim holy 
book, in a sign of mourning.
People scurried, sobbing, through 
rain-soaked streets, and a distraught 
crowd of hundreds gathered at the 
hospital where Hussein died. Elderly 
women wailed and shook with grief, 
while men cried into their red-andwhite head scarves, wrapped around 
their faces in a traditional gesture of 
mourning. Guards blocked their way, 
but there was no confrontation, for 
some guards were weeping as well.
Elsewhere, people came together in 
quiet mourning.
The king died at 11:43 am local time 
in his bed at the King Hussein Medical 
City. Jordans Cabinet immediately 
met and proclaimed Crown Prince 
Abdullah king, a day after he was 
named regent.
The new king was sworn in just four 
hours later in a solemn ceremony at 
Parliament. Lawmakers wore their red 
keffiyehs wrapped around their faces.
The kingship was transferred con
stitutionally to Crown Prince Abdullah 
... in view of His Majesty King 
Husseins death, said a Cabinet state
ment read over state TV.
Queen Noor and Husseins children 
were all with him when he died, a 
senior palace source said. The imme
diate cause of death was heart failure 
brought on by complications from can
cer, the official said.
The king had been on a respirator, 
which was not switched off until after
his heart had stopped and his brain 
function completely ceased, a medical 
source said.
This is Gods judgment and Gods 
will, the 37-year-old Abdullah told 
the nation in a solemn address less 
than an hour after the death. God 
bless Hussein the father, the brother, 
the commander, and the man.... We 
will preserve Husseins legacy.
Intoning the same words his father 
had customarily used for such ad
dresses, Abdullah called on my fam
ily and my tribe to be loyal.
The king had maintained an ex
traordinarily close personal relation
ship with his people, and ordinary 
Jordanians appeared genuinely 
grief-stricken.
In my heart he will always be my 
king, said Mohammed Ibrahim as 
flags were lowered in the streets of 
Amman and portraits of the king were 
draped with black.
In Washington, President Clinton 
said in a statement that he and first 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were 
deeply saddened by the news.
I had prayed that this day would 
not come soon. ButGod has called 
King Hussein to his reward, the presi
dent said. Both Clintons will attend 
the funeral, along with former presi
dents Ford, Carter, and Bush.
The funeral was to be held Monday, 
in keeping with the Islamic tradition of 
swift burial, said a Cabinet minister, 
speaking on condition of anonymity.
The king, who was the countrys 
supreme military commander, was 
expected to be buried with full mili
tary honors, with an elaborate proces
sion through the streets of Amman 
and many world leaders on hand.
The king had left the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn., on Thursday after 
his body rejected a bone marrow trans
plant, part of his treatment for lym
phatic cancer.
Men go to jail for 
threatening email
BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP)  Two 
men accused in an alleged plot to use 
biological weapons against President 
Clinton and other officials were sen
tenced Friday to more than 24 years in 
prison for sending threatening email to 
government agencies.
Johnie Wise and Jack Abbott Grebe, 
both members of the separatist group 
Republic of Texas, gave rambling anti
government speeches at their sentenc
ing and challenged U.S. District Judge 
Hilda Tagles jurisdiction.
They were convicted in October of send
ing email to the Internal Revenue Service 
and the Drug Enforcement Agency, threat
ening to use biological weapons against 
government employees and their families.
Wise, Grebe, and a third man were 
acquitted of conspiring to develop a de
vice in which a modified Bic lighter would 
shoot a cactus needle coated with a toxin 
such as anthrax, the AIDS virus, rabies, 
or botulism.
Peace negotiation 
will begin in Delhi
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  Paki
stan and India will hold talks later this 
month in the Indian capital in an effort 
to ease tension between the rival neigh
bors, a news agency reported Saturday.
Since conducting underground nuclear 
tests in May, Pakistan and India have been 
under intense pressure from the interna
tional community to improve relations.
The foreign secretaries of India and Pa
kistan will meet in New Delhi for three 
days beginning February 18 to discuss the 
disputed border region of Kashmir, accord
ing to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
Kashmir has been the flash point for 
two of three wars they have fought since 
independence. The Himalayan region was 
divided between the two nations after 
British rule ended in 1947, and both lay 
claim to a united Kashmir.
Indian officials accuse Pakistan of arm
ing and training militant secessionists in 
its Kashmir territory. Officials in 
Pakistans capital, Islamabad, deny the
charges, and say they give the secession
ists only political and diplomatic support.
A first round of talks between the 
foreign secretaries of the two countries 
was held in Pakistan in October, but 
ended without any major breakthroughs.
Native American 
challenges court
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)  Sioux ac
tor and activist Russell Means went on 
trial before the Navajo Supreme Court on 
Saturday in a case that tests the legitimacy 
of the American Indian justice system.
The court convened at Harvard Uni
versity to hear an assault case against 
Means, a founder of the American In
dian Movement who led an uprising at 
Wounded Knee, S.D., and has appeared 
in such films as Natural Born Killers.
Means is accused of beating his fa
ther-in-law in 1997 in Arizonas Navajo 
Nation, but as an Oglala Sioux he insists 
he cannot be prosecuted by another tribe.
Tribal leaders nationwide are watch
ing the case, since it could mean the 
erosion of their rights to handle crimes on 
their own lands.
Means claims a federal law that gave 
Indian tribes the right to prosecute non
member Indians is invalid because it 
came a year after the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled a tribes judicial powers 
extend only to members of its own tribe.
He also says such a rule discriminates 
against Indians not belonging to the 
ruling tribe.
If you assert jurisdiction over Russell 
Means, you deny him his right to equal 
protection under the Fifth Amendment, 
said Meanss attorney, John Trebon.
Means was in Ecuador on Saturday 
and did not attend the hearing.
In 1973, members of the Indian rights 
group AIM seized the hamlet ofWounded 
Knee in protest against reservation 
conditions and the federally backed 
tribal government.
Means emerged a leader in the twomonth standoff that ensued, and shootouts 
left two occupiers dead and a federal mar
shal paralyzed.
Means has vowed to take the case to the 
U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. The 
court has consistently scaled back tribal 
court powers over the past two decades.
Mr. Means, by his actions, has 
consented to the jurisdiction of the Na
vajo Nation and he became part of 
the community, said Navajo Nation 
prosecutor Donovan D. Brown. If the 
court rules that there is no jurisdiction, 
within the Navajo Nation at least, it 
will create opportunities for illegal 
activists to basically go unpunished. 
Brown discounted Trebons arguments 
that Navajo prosecution violated Means 
civil rights.
The Constitution does not apply to 
the Navajo nation, he said. The Navajo 
Nation predates the Constitution.
Sitting underneath a Navajo Nation 
flag bearing a rainbow and buffalo, the 
three justices took the case under ad
visement. They are expected to issue a 
decision in several weeks from their 
headquarters in Arizona.
Billionaire makes 
record donations
SEATTLE (AP)  The worlds richest 
man, Bill Gates, has given away 
$3.34 billion in new donations for chari
ties that fund health and education 
projects worldwide.
The money from Gates and his wife, 
Melinda, is believed to be the largest 
charitable gift ever made, Fortune maga
zine said.
The donation includes $2.23 billion 
to the William H. Gates Foundation, 
named after and administered by Gates 
father, and $1.11 billion to the Gates 
Learning Foundation, Gates 
spokeswoman Rose Berg-Fosnaugh 
said Friday.
The William H. Gates Foundation pro
vides grants for health, population, and 
education projects worldwide, and vari
ous causes in the Seattle area.
The Gates Learning Foundation, 
formerly the Gates Library Foundation, 
is dedicated to closing the gap between 
poor children and wealthier ones in 
Internet access and computer training.
Gates Microsoft holdings are worth 
more than $82 billion.
In November, Gates donated $20 
million to the Seattle Public Library  
the biggest single gift ever made 
to a public library system, the spokes
woman said.Congress hears testimony on Senate floor from former intern
WASHINGTON (AP)Monica 
Lewinsky told her story in public 
at long last on Saturday, testify
ing in videotape snippets before 
President Clintons impeachment 
trial and a nationwide television 
audience about a White House 
sexual affair and cover-up.
First House prosecutors, then 
the presidents defense team 
served up segments of her taped 
deposition to the Senate to but
tress the case for and against 
Clintons conviction.
In portions aired at the behest 
of prosecutors, Lewinsky said 
Clinton had never instructed her 
to tell the truth when word of the 
affair began to leak, responding 
correct when asked if that were 
the case. I knew I would deny 
the relationship, she also said.
But in tape shown by the 
Clinton defense team, she testi
fied Clinton did not suggest she 
use their cover story in an affida
vit she was to file in the Paula 
Jones lawsuit. In addition, she 
said she never thought the affi
davit was to be false. Had Clinton 
suggested that, she said, I would 
have remembered something like 
that, and I dont.
There was no indication that 
her testimony had shaken the 
prospects for Clintons expected 
acquittal on the two articles of 
impeachment by the end of the 
week. Already, Democrats were 
angling for Republican votes for 
a plan to censure the president 
following his acquittal.
Sen. Larry Craig(R-Idaho) told 
reporters after the days trial ses
sion he thought a majority of sena
tors might vote Clinton guilty, 
more on the charge of obstruction 
of justice than on perjury. But
that would be far less than the 
two-thirds needed to convict him 
and remove him from office.
Democratic support for Clinton 
is overwhelming, although West 
Virginias Sen. Robert C. Byrd 
left open the possibility in an 
ABC interview that he might vote 
to convict.
Some Democrats said 
Lewinsky had helped Clintons 
cause. She says over and over he 
never talked to her about the 
contents of the affidavit, said 
Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.)
But Craig said the prosecutors 
presentation, which included videotaped testimony from 
Lewinsky, presidential friend 
Vernon Jordan, and White House 
aide Sidney Blumenthal, was 
devastating to the White House. 
The Senate, signaling its ea
gerness to wrap up the trial, re
fused earlier this week to allow 
House prosecutors to call 
Lewinsky for live testimony.
Instead, senators gave the pros
ecutors, then White House law
yers, three hours each to present 
portions of videotape to buttress 
their cases for and against 
Clintons conviction.
Rep. Jim Rogan (R-Calif.) was 
scathing. Disputing Clintons 
claim that his relationship with 
Lewinsky had begun as a 
friendship, the California Repub
lican said, The president impul
sively began using her for his 
gratification the very day he first 
spoke to her.
He juxtaposed the image of 
Lewinsky, swearing an oath to 
tell the truth, with the familiar 
footage of Clinton denying sexual 
relations with that woman, 
Ms. Lewinsky.
If her testimony is truthful, 
then the president committed the 
offenses in the articles of impeach
ment, Rogan said. Lewinsky was 
granted immunity from prosecu
tion by Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr, and could face 
prosecution if her testimony 
turned out to be false.
It was Lewinskys appearance 
that was the highlight of the days 
trial session.
She recalled the night Clinton 
called to say she might be 
subpoenaed as a witness in Jones 
sexual harassment lawsuit. 
The president spoke of the ear
lier cover stories they had 
devised to hide the affair, 
she said.
From what I learned in that 
conversation, I thought to myself 
I knew I would deny the relation
ship, she answered.
But no sooner had prosecutors 
completed their presentation 
than Nicole Seligman, a 
private attorney for the 
president, was on her feet 
to rebut.
The snippets you have seen 
are terribl[yl misleading, she 
told the trial. House prosecutors 
have created a profoundly erro
neous impression.
Off the Senate floor, Democrats 
were eager for passage of a 
censure resolution. One draft 
would accuse the president of 
shameless, reckless, and inde
fensible behavior.
Some Republicans are ada
mantly opposed to any censure, 
and one, Ted Stevens of Alaska, 
dismissed the draft in circulation 
as far too weak. Its just 
like a pat on the butt, he 
told reporters.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  8 February 19993
University remembers generosity of famous philanthropist
MELLON, from page 1
Mellon was also named as an 
honorary chair of the five-year 
Campaign for Carnegie Mellon 
(Capital Campaign) that extended 
between 1986 and 1991.
Herbert Simon, University pro
fessor of psychology and computer 
science, remembered meeting 
Mellon in Skibo Hall sometime in 
1990, while asking for support for 
the new drama building.
Most conversations are ... full 
ofinconsequentialities that dont 
tell you anything about anything.
Conversations with a person of 
wealth are especially so.... For 
some wealthy people this becomes 
destructive of their images of 
themselves, because they no 
longer think that anyone can be 
interested in them apart from their 
money, said Simon. But Mr. 
Mellon appears to have made 
his peace with this problem.... 
He comes across in his autobiog
raphy and in his contacts with 
all the people who dealt with 
him as a modest person of 
real substance.
Mellon was probably best 
known for his philanthropic en
deavors concerning the arts. He 
oversaw the building of the Na
tional Gallery of Art in Washing
ton, which his father had con
ceived before his death in 1937.
His generosity and modesty 
were really extraordinary, 
said Prekop. He helped the 
National Gallery purchase a Jack
son Poliak, even though he 
had no interest in it himself.... 
He wanted to keep it in 
the country.
Mellons interests contrasted 
with those of his father, Andrew 
Mellon, who was one of the most 
successful American bankers and 
businessmen of all time.
Throughout his life he had seri
ous interests in collecting art... and 
in raising racehorses, at least one of 
which won the Kentucky Derby  
not your usual occupations, said 
Simon. But he dealt with them 
seriously and responsibly
This was one of the great phi
lanthropists of the century, who 
had a clear agenda of fundamental importance to the quality of 
national life, said Stearns.
Memorial services will be held 
in Upperville and at the National 
Gallery, which also plans a me
morial exhibition.
Mellon is survived by his wife of 
50years,RachelLambertLloyd; by 
two children by his first wife, Mary 
Conover Brown, who died in 1946, 
Catherine Conover and Timothy 
Mellon; and three grandchildren: 
John W. Warner, the son of the 
senior senator from Virginia, Mary 
W. Greenway, and Virginia Warner.
Carnegie Mellon lost a great 
friend when Paul Mellon died. His 
vision and support were instru
mental in the merger in 1967, 
said President Jared Cohon.
During the ten or so years it took 
to bring about [the merger], I dont 
think I have ever worked harder or 
spent longer hours on the telephone 
and in meetings, said Mellon in his 
autobiography. But in retrospect, 
I feel that it was well worth every 
minute and that it was a positive 
accomplishment of which I could be 
justifiably proud.
Crime and Incident Report
2/1 THEFT, 9:54 am  A doctoral 
student in Wean Hall returned to his 
office after the weekend and noticed that 
one of his desk drawers was partially 
open. He quickly removed the change 
holder and counted his change. He deter
mined that 50 cents was missing, so he 
called Campus Police to report the theft. 
The responding officer asked the victim if 
anything else had been taken, but he 
said no, pointing out that a Walkman, a 
computer, and several other items of value 
were undisturbed. The officer finished 
taking the report and advised the victim 
to keep closer tabs on his things.
2/3 VEHICLE ACCIDENT, 4:26 pm 
 The Campus Police office received a 
radio call from an officer saying that 
CMU Police Car 1 had been involved in 
a traffic accident. Another officer was 
needed to complete the transport of two 
CMU students to Mercy Hospital, a duty 
made more urgent since the sick male 
had struck his nose on the cars Plexiglass 
cage during the accident.
An officer responded to the intersec
tion of Forbes Avenue and Dithridge 
Street. The officer in the accident told 
the responding officer that a PAT bus 
was stopped in the right lane on Forbes 
just before the Dithridge intersection. 
He changed lanes to pass the bus. As he 
was driving in the left lane, a car came
from Dithridge Street and hit the police 
car. The responding officer took the two 
students to the hospital.
2/5 SIMPLE ASSAULT, 2:12 am  
A Campus Police officer had just finished 
checking the rear of the CMU accounting 
and payroll office on South Craig Street 
and was driving through the Exxon Sta
tion to get onto Forbes Avenue. As he was 
pulling past the pumps, he saw a group of 
three males standing in front of ablackcar 
near the bridge. They were talking to 
another male who was approaching the 
car, coming from the direction of Panther 
Hollow Inn (PHI). A fourth male in a green 
j acket was following the odd man out. The 
approaching male reached his car and 
tried to get in. The following male at that 
point tried to slam the others head into 
the cars door frame. The officer activated 
his light and radioed for backup. The four 
males ran across the bridge and into the 
Morewood Gardens parking lot. The respondingbackup officers checked the area 
for the actors, with negative results.
The other officer checked the victim of 
the attempted assault. He said he was 
fine and did not need medical assis
tance. He told the officer that his greenj acket-clad assailant was upset with him 
because of an incident at PHI and be
lieved that this incident was the reason 
for the assault. The victim had stopped
the attacker from taking home an in
toxicated female friend of the victims.
2/6 VEHICLE FIRE, 1:49 pm  A 
CMU grad students car battery was 
dead behind Smith Hall. She asked a 
friend of hers for a jump, and he agreed. 
Her friend attached the jumper cables to 
his BMW first and to her Honda second. 
She, in the meantime, took some paper 
towels from a Smith Hall restroom be
cause the cables were wet. They dried off 
the cables, and then tried to proceed 
with the jump. Her friend started his car 
and she tried to start hers, but nothing 
happened  nothing except that the 
jumper cables ignited. The friend took a 
fire extinguisher from Smith Hall and 
put out the flames. She called Campus 
Police to report the incident.
The responding officer checked the 
jumper cables and saw that the friend 
had attached them incorrectly. There was 
minor damage to both vehicles. The BMW 
suffered scorched rubber on the trunk 
molding and right rear bumper and a 
slightly melted tail light. The Honda had 
a melted right front turn signal. Both 
vehicles had fire extinguisher discharge 
on them. The officer provided the female 
with a jump, and all three left.

CMU must address parking space crunch
There are approximately 2,250 
parking spaces on campus, a fig
ure that may come as a surprise to 
the 162 students currently wait
ing for a parking permit. Even 
with the recent re-striping of the 
Morewood parking lot to create 
taore spaces, there is simply not 
enough parking for everyone who 
jieeds it. It is often impossible for 
on-campus and commuter students 
to get a parking permit for Oak
land or Shadyside streets, because 
they do not live in these areas. 
Because so many students neces
sarily restricted to parking on cam
pus property, the University should 
take immediate and decisive steps 
to reduce the shortage.
Even with such a long waiting 
list for parking permits, the Uni
versity has chosen to sell 20 per
mits in the Morewood parking lot 
to WQED. According to Parking 
Services, this was done in the in
terest of being a good neighbor. 
While CMU and WQED have a 
strong business and educational 
relationship that should be culti
vated, promotion of relations 
should not be done at the expense 
of those who are actually affiliated 
withtheUniversity, many ofwhom 
have been on the waiting list for 
months. Those 20 permits should 
be reassigned to those on the wait
ing list, and the WQED permit 
holders should be refunded their 
money. WQED has its own park
ing lot; it shouldnt need to buy 
parkingfrom CMU in orderto meet 
its needs.
Special events, such as academic 
conferences or the filmingthattook 
place on campus last week, result
in temporary parking shortages. 
At these times, parking lots are 
closed off to accommodate the visi
tors, and permit holders are left to 
fend for themselves, often having 
to pay meters for parking when 
they have already paid for a permit. 
Spring Carnival, which closes al
most all of the Morewood parking 
lot, is a prime example of the chaos 
that can ensue when hundreds of 
cars are forced to look for parking 
elsewhere, putting additional load 
on the already sparse parking re
sources on campus.
Including new parking lots in the 
plans for construction currently 
taking place on campus could offer 
relief, but unfortunately, no such 
plans currently exist. Indeed, de
spite the likely higher enrollment 
and extra staff and faculty that will 
accompany the completion of the 
Purnell Center and the additions to 
Building D, no new parking lots 
have been planned at all. Such lack 
of foresight only further exacer
bates the parking problem, and 
should be corrected with new plans 
for more parking facilities  an
other lot, or if there is insufficient 
space for a lot, perhaps a garage 
could be built over an existing lot.
Many students choose to live off 
campus, and Housing Services has 
all but begged upperclassmen to 
move out of the dorms to make 
room for first-year students. Given 
the continual increase in 
demand, its clear that the parking 
shortage is a problem that will not 
go away. The administration must 
take steps to reduce the shortage 
and accommodate all commuters 
to CMU.

University should consider alternate bus agreements
Letter to 
the Editor
The Office of Student Affairs is 
currently negotiating with the Port 
Authority of Allegheny County to 
provide the campus community 
with unlimited access to the Port 
Authority bus system by showing 
a CMU ID. If such a program is 
enacted, the student body will pay 
for usage of the system through a 
new required fee. While the 
administrations efforts to reach 
such a deal are commendable in 
that the proposed program will 
benefit students, other approaches 
that do not require participation 
by every student should be consid
ered as well.
The University of Pittsburgh al
ready has an agreement with the 
Port Authority similar to the one 
under consideration by CMU. Ac
cording to Pitts Transportation 
Office, the money for their pro
gram comes from a Security, 
Safety, and Transportation Fee, 
which is $55 per semester for a 
full-time student. Under a required 
fee system, students who regularly 
ride the buses will get a bargain. 
However, it will be at the expense 
ofthe students who have cars, walk 
to campus, live on campus, or just 
'dont desire to use PATs services. 
It is unfair to require these stu
dents to help shoulder the burden 
of paying for something they do 
not use.
Since the campus community al
ready has a sizable number of Port 
Authority customers, it should be 
possible for the administration to 
negotiate a system in which individuals from CMU can ride for a 
reduced fare or purchase abuspass 
for a reduced rate. According to the 
Port Authority, such a program al
ready exists at Chatham and 
Carlow Colleges. Students at these 
schools can ride anywhere within 
the area designated as Zone 1, which 
includes all of the city of Pittsburgh 
as well as the nearest suburbs, for 
50 cents after 7 pm with their stu
dent ID.
If a tentative agreement between 
CMU and the Port Authority is 
reached, it will need to pass a stu
dent referendum before it receives 
final approval. Both CMU and the 
Port Authority could use the re
sults of this referendum to gauge 
the level of student interest, and 
subsequently to design a program 
that would best suit CMUs needs. 
If there is sufficient interest, the 
ideal program would allow students 
to purchase discount passes at a 
rate still profitable for the Port Au
thority. This would offer interested 
students the benefit of reducedfare riding while not imposing a fee 
on those who would not use the 
Port Authority system.
The administration should cer
tainly continue to work on a deal 
with the Port Authority, but it 
should change its focus from a required-fee system to one that gives 
students the option to not be in
cluded. Even if the majority of stu
dents would benefit under the pro
posed deal, imposing a new fee on 
every student is not necessarily the 
best solution.
Editor:
I write with a heavy 
heart in response to 
Mr. Libers blatant 
display of religious in
tolerance in his col
umn entitled Religion cannot dictate 
U.S. justice. Sadly, even after thou
sands of martyrs and the bloody re
minder of the Holocaust, society has yet 
to overcome the specter of religious preju
dice. Mr. Liber uses the issue of discre
tion in the sentencing of criminals as a 
thinly veiled pretense to bash Catholics. 
His bias screams out from his disgust 
at the Pope having any influence in 
American justice. He continues his as
sault by claiming that the opinion of 
celebrities should carry more weight 
than that of the Pope, who, by the way, 
is the spiritual leader of over 1 billion 
Catholics, earned two PhDs, speaks over 
six languages, and ended communism 
in Poland. What troubles me most about 
Mr. Libers article is how unabashedly 
hateful his attacks are. For example, 
according to him, the Catholic Church 
is perhaps the most persecuting and 
bigoted religious body ever to exist. 
Since I am a proud member of the afore
mentioned religious body, who, pray tell, 
am I persecuting? Also, why mention 
the little Popemobile if not to dispar
age the Holy Father? Unfortunately, I 
have encountered Mr. Libers hate 
speech all too often on university cam
puses. Of the myriad of diversity pan
els I attend, none ever speak of reli
gious bigotry anymore  not because it 
has been eradicated, but because it has 
been quietly accepted. Since such irraeG

Editor:
Mr. Liber demon
strated a stunning 
lack of research on his 
part in his column. In 
doing so, he has mis
represented an instiLetter to the Editor
tution with which one-third of the stu
dent body at CMU is affiliated.
Indeed, every assumption he makes 
about the Catholic Church is misguided. 
He accuses the church of being the most 
persecuting and bigoted religious body 
ever to exist. In fact, the Church advo
cates respect for all humans, and frowns 
mightily on any hint of prejudice. It does 
not discriminate on the basis of race or 
gender. It does not discriminate on the 
basis of color, social conditions, lan
guage, or religion. It does not discrimi
nate on the basis of sexual orientation. 
What it does do is espouse reverence for 
the life of all persons, whether unborn, 
young, old, or dying.
Furthermore, the Church recognizes 
the authority of civil governments. Rec
ognition of civil authority is explicitly 
extended to include the authority of a 
government to impose the death penalty.
Mr. Libers primary complaint seems to 
be that Governor Carnahan commuted 
the sentence of a convicted murderer after 
hearing the Holy Fathers plea. It should 
be noted that the Pontiff appeals for clem
ency in all death penalty cases. In every 
case, it is the governor and not the Pope 
who has the final say in whether a death 
sentence is commuted to life in prison. 
U.S. state law grants the governor and 
only the governor the ability to commute a 
sentence or pardon a prisoner.

The Tartan has maintained a not-sohidden agenda of discrimination 
against the Greek community. All one 
has to do is turn your recent copy of The 
Tartan to page L2 and look at the 
graphic at the top of the page. Here, 
under the guise of a representative

with Greek letters advertising a Brat 
Party. Last week, this appeared directly 
above a photo of Delta Tau Deltas com
memoration of Judith Resnik on the 
Fence, a tribute no one else on campus 
even remembered.
Some may agree with this drawings 
idea. Certainly The Tartan endorses it. 
But that does not make it right, either 
factually or morally. Indeed, by publish
ing this drawing, The Tartan is endors
ing and promoting an environment 
hostile to Greeks  an environment 
which then poisons Greek-campus rela
tionships and demotes the positive con
tributions the Greek community makes 
to this campus.
The Tartan should own up to its pro
fessional journalistic responsibility by 
revoking the drawing and apologizing to 
the campus as a whole for its bias. Fail
ure to do so violates the canon of ethics 
every newspaper takes upon itself, and 
is a black mark on its long and tenured 
history. Certainly many Greek alumni of 
this campus would be saddened and an
gered by this turn of events.

The New Years celebration is over,

classmates and giving the ugly ones to the 
people they dont like because the teacher 
said they had to make one for everybody.
Immediately following the annual 
Valentines Day rush is an immense 
amount of complaining from people who 
hate paper lace or pink-heart-covered 
things, from everyone who doesnt actu

greeting cards, and from depressed thirdgrade dorks who have a tall stack of ugly 
valentines. You cant help but be sur

Im neither a lover nor a hater of

concept, even though people really 
shouldnt need a reminder to do some
thing good for the person they love. Unfor

with Valentines Day, like the candy and 
the movies and the heart-shaped cookies, 
are more of a cheapening of love than a 
celebration of it.
I can give you what I view to be the 
perfect example of all this. What would 
you say is the love story that is told most 
often? Usually, when you ask people this 
question, their answer is Romeo and Juliet. 
A half-dozen movies have been made from 
it, it has been acted out by half the highschool theater groups in the country, and 
practically everyone had to read it and 
analyze it in one of their classes. Admit
tedly, there are other aspects to the play, 
like the strife between families and the 
fact that the play itself was well-written, 
but in most peoples minds, Romeo and 
Juliet is a love story.
Thats the part I dont understand. Heres 
the plot: Romeo tries to declare his love for 
Rosalind, but gets rejected hard. Not will
ing to give up, Romeo puts on a mask and 
sneaks into a party to see Rosalind, but he 
sees Juliet dancing and decides that shes 
cuter. Unfortunately, Romeo has to leave, 
and naturally, he decides to go stand out
side Juliets window. Stalker! Romeo (still 
on the rebound from Rosalind, mind you) 
professes his love 
for Juliet, despite 
the fact that the two 
of them have never 
had the slightest bit 
of meaningful con
versation. Juliet 
thinks that Romeo 
is really sexy too, so 
she tells him that 
shell marry him.
The next night,
Romeo sneaks back 
to Juliets room, af
ter killing a mem
ber of her family.
Once again, without 
so much as a So how was your day? the 
two of them hop into bed and have sex 
all night. But it all ends sadly, when 
Romeo has to leave the country, and Juliet 
has the bright idea of pretending that 
shes killed herself. Romeo thinks shes 
really dead, and on the basis of their 
one night of sex, decides that he should 
kill himself. Juliet wakes up, finds out 
that she cant have sex with Romeo 
anymore, and kills herself too, ending 
the play.
This is the story that most people think 
of when you say the words love story. In 
my opinion, its more of a lust story. But, if 
this is what people think love is, then no 
wonder Valentines Day is such a pathetic 
and hollow reflection of what a holiday for 
celebrating your ultimate and true love 
should be.

Singles should acquire lives
Open Forum
by Yishan Wong
Every year around early February, it is 
suggested that maybe someone 
could write about Valentines Day. Any
one want to write about how Valentines 
Day is just a holiday for the card and 
floral industries? Its become en vogue 
for people to 
complain about 
such holidays 
becoming 
commercial
ized and 
meaningless.
Well, no 
more. You 
might be read
ing some bitter, 
co-dependent 
single writers 
clichd rant 
about how dis___________________ gusting couples
Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff arg and how
holidays like this just serve to make single 
people more painfully aware of Carnegie 
Mellons male-female ratio, and that the 
whole thing is just pushed by HallmarkBavaria. Well, maybe thats true  but 
the Order has commanded me to help 
maintain the cover on the conspiracy. So, 
allow me to reveal the real nature of 
Valentines Day. Its important that we 
understand and appreciate the cultural 
traditions that led to our completely dif
ferent modern-day celebrations, instead 
of complaining about it.
As you may know, Valentine was a 
martyr who was beheaded after defying 
Emperor Claudiuss order not to marry 
young couples, a decree made because 
Claudius felt the young men would be 
unwilling to leave their wives to go to 
war. While awaiting his execution, Val
entine apparently fell in love with the 
jailers daughter. Before he was executed, 
he wrote her a final testimony of his love 
for her, signing it Your Valentine  
hence the current phrase.
This is a martyrs holiday were talking 
about. Using Valentines Day to complain 
about your lack of a significant other is 
cliched and old. Its not cool, its not funny 
 its a trite, boring idea. Jesus was a 
martyryou dont hear people complain
ing about Christmas because theyre bit
ter about not having a ... uh, a Christian, 
do you? As Thomas Jefferson once [prob
ably] said, No, I dont think so. The 
entire idea is as overused and prosaic as 
quoting the Founding Fathers to sup
port ones argument instead of offering 
real reasons.
Get over the bitterness. On some 
Valentines Days past, Ive been in a rela
tionship. On others, I havent. This year, I 
happen to be single, and I dont have a 
problem with it. If youre with someone, 
good, enjoy the day with them and take 
advantage of the cheap opportunity to get 
laid. If not, let it pass like any other day 
and quit being bitter. In fact, just to spread 
a little happiness around, have a dozen 
roses sent to some random girl whom you 
know is single. It might not solve the 
problem of you being a pathetic loser, but 
itll sure make her happy. Stop wallowing 
in your own self-pity and try thinking 
about others for a change. And youll feel 
nice because you got to send someone 
flowers. Dont believe me? Well, remem
ber what Ben Franklin [probably] said: I 
think thats a good idea.
And before you get too mad at me, re
member how lucky you are to be alive. At 
least you have your health. This part may 
sound like a bunch of irrelevant bullshit, 
but youre not being forced to go to war and 
leave your significant other (if any) behind 
and you havent been sentenced to death 
for marrying young couples. Do you really 
want to fall in love with a jailers daughter 
shortly before beingbeheaded? Give thanks 
for what the Order has done to stabilize 
international relations and turn the floral 
industry into an assembly-line mass-production juggernaut so that buying roses 
are within your meager proletariat means. 
In short, please stop rocking the boat. You 
have no idea of the magnitude of forces 
with which you toy.
Yishan Wong wishes the Illuminati 
would simply employ more cleaners, in
stead of making him invent cover stories 
for their botched conspiracies.
Misunderstanding illustrates postmodernist failings
Rob Jefferson
Two weeks ago, David Howard, 
an aide of Washington, D.C. 
mayor Anthony Williams, spoke 
of the methodology by which pub
lic funding must be managed. 
Howard described it as being nig
gardly, which someone confused 
with a racial epithet. Because of 
this unwanted confusion, Howard 
resigned from his post. (He was 
later rehired.)
The comment, and subsequent 
resignation, caused a riotous fu
ror. Some people were complain
ing about the fact that Mayor 
Williams accepted Howards res
ignation, since it was uncalledfor. Others saw the entire affair 
as the fault of the aide, who 
didnt watch what he was 
saying in these heated times.
As I saw this story unfold, I
became increasingly distressed 
by the intellectual paucity in 
our country. Instead of caring 
about issues such as urban vio
lence, the roller-coaster stock 
market, or even the impeachment 
trial, the nation actually both
ered to debate about the case of 
words. Even the meaning of 
words isnt an issue here; its de
generated into an issue of sound 
and perception.
It should be obvious that David 
Howard was not at fault. His only 
crime was having a word misun
derstood. Niggardly, being the 
adverbial form of niggard, de
rives itself from the Scandina
vian word nigard, which has no 
racial connotations. The fact that 
someone did not know the differ
ence between niggardly and a 
racial epithet is the fault of that 
person. Its a word that can be 
found in any general-purpose dic
tionary worth owning, and be
cause of its non-use in common
vernacular, it can most likely be 
found on the SAT or ACT.
This case brings up a few points 
of potential danger. As a culture, 
we are changing our emphasis 
from content to form, reality to 
perception, semantics to context. 
What is said is less of an issue 
now; instead, what really mat
ters is the form in which the mes
sage is given. A banal statement 
made in a non-offensive way 
has become more important in 
our society than statements that 
actually mean something but 
may offend people. It is unfortu
nate that this shift in emphasis 
can cause new ideas to be com
pletely ignored because of poten-. 
tial offensiveness.
One can see the cause of this 
development in the political cor
rectness movement. One of the fea
tures of the philosophy is a system
atic replacing of suspect words 
with non-offensive language. A 
person is not fired; she or he is
dehired or put into 
the mobility pool.
Serial killer is a po
tentially offensive 
term; they are. per
sons with difficult-tomeet needs. Men, on 
the other hand, are 
called rapists; 
white males gain the 
title oppressors as 
well. The PC justifi
cation for this distinc
tion is that the pro
ponents are only at
tempting to show 
what concepts underlie the words. 
My only response is: Nice try.
The political correctness move
ment is philosophically steeped 
in postmodernism and its off
shoot, deconstructionism. The 
postmodernist belief is that real
ity is solely a product of language, 
and that the manipulation of lan
guage causes the manipulation 
of reality. While there may be
Cory Shopper/Tartan Art Staff 
truth in the statement that lan
guage is one of the components in 
realitys formation and percep
tion, the statement that reality is 
merely the result of language is 
laughable. Taking a word out of 
the language does not annihilate 
the concept it describes, even if it 
is a state of mind as opposed to a 
physical object.

Officials cant ignore wordsCompanies followNIGGARDLY, from page 5
Tied with this is the 
deconstructionist belief that 
meaning is nonexistent, since 
concepts that have opposites pre
suppose the existence of the op
posite. For example, the Decla
ration of Independence is actu
ally a statement advocating op
pression and slavery, since the 
concept of freedom would not 
exist without the existence of 
oppression. Since these two con
cepts are interconnected, they 
nullify themselves, since any at
tempt to accentuate one also 
emphasizes the other.
With these tools, political cor
rectness attempts to change the 
way people think by changing 
the words that they are permit
ted to use. By manipulating lan
guage, PC proponents hope to 
clarify matters and to not offend 
people. Instead, the language 
becomes purified, sterilized, and 
obfuscated. Expressing emotions 
becomes more and more diffi
cult, since words of passion, rage, 
and excitement are replaced by
sanitized bromides. Rather than 
clarifyingideas, PC actually stifles 
creativity, for fear of touching some 
forbidden concept or another. 
What results from this is a nation 
of people too afraid to think or 
express their thoughts outside of 
arbitrary boundaries.
The result of the permeation of 
postmodernist philosophy in our 
society is situations such as that 
of David Howard. Rather than let 
discourse go as it may, even valid 
statements are being analyzed 
and misinterpreted. While 
Howard was reinstated, we can 
use his case as an example. If you 
are wrongfully accused of violat
ing a postmodernist more, dont 
give up. Defend the sacredness of 
our language, attack the 
postmodernists with logical 
thought, and most important, be 
absolutely niggardly in the affec
tion you give them.

WINTEL, from page 5
fuss with its high system re
quirements: Microsoft recom
mends at least a 300 MHz pro
cessor with 64 MB of RAM, 
which in my opinion is a rather 
absurd requirement. The rea
son Windows 2000 has such 
high requirements to run is due 
to all the new features it has, 
which bloat the code to 35 mil
lion lines. With that many lines 
of code, its no wonder that 
Microsoft is having trouble fin
ishing it. They cant possibly 
debug 35 million lines of code 
and make Windows 2000 
stable. They cant even get their 
current operating systems to 
run without constant crashes 
and reboots. Microsoft should 
focus on increasing the quality 
and stability of their current 
operating system, rather than 
continuing to add features and 
increase instability.
Because of these problems 
Microsoft is having with Win
dows, many people and corpo
rations are looking into an 
alternative operating system 
for their current hardware. The 
best alternative to Windows 
is currently Linux, which is a 
more robust, stable operating 
system than Windows NT and 
98. However, Linux is still too 
cumbersome on the desktop 
for the average computer user, 
because it is far too difficult to 
configure. Its open-source 
model just speeds development, 
though (the open-source code 
lets anyone freely modify the 
software, as long as any 
improvements get distributed

to the whole Linux community), 
such that soon a consumerfriendly Linux could be created. 
The real market for Linux is the 
server market. A Linux server 
with Samba is a whopping 250 
percent faster than a Windows 
NT server running on the same 
hardware, which proves that Win
dows is bloatware compared to 
the lean and mean Linux.
Linux is also gaining recogni
tion from hardware manufactur
ers who want to include it on 
their machines, such as Dell, 
Hewlett Packard, Compaq, and
Silicon Graphics. And Linux 
also saves a lot of money: Linux 
is free, NT Server costs $809 for 
a five-client license. Linux also 
is more stable than NT and re
quires many fewer system 
reboots, resulting in greater 
server uptime. Since Windows 
2000 may never see 
the light of day without constant 
crashes and reboots, Linux eas
ily could displace Windows NT 
Server. It could also replace Win
dows 98/NT Workstation if it 
becomes easier to use and more 
applications become available. 
Simply put, Linux is faster and 
cheaper than Windows, so why 
not use it instead if you are run
ning a server?
Microsoft is also having trouble 
with the antitrust suit against 
it. The Department of Justice 
has just cornered Microsoft with 
its faked video on how the re
moval of Internet Explorer from 
Windows 98 decreases perfor
mance. I remember adding 
Internet Explorer 4 with Active 
Desktop to my Windows 95- 
based computer. It was about 20 
percent slower after doing so. 
Ziff-Davis also did some tests
program
confirming that Windows 98 isindeed slower than Windows 95 
because Active Desktop takes up 
system resources, even when dis
abled. Microsoft now has no claim 
that Internet Explorers absence 
from Windows 98 would cause it 
to function worse. Internet Ex
plorer was integrated into the 
operating system to gain market 
share and thwart Netscape, and 
is the foremost example of 
Microsoft code bloat: It decreased 
stability in Windows and de
creased performance of the 
whole OS. How can Microsoft
possibly succeed in proving the 
opposite, that Windows 98 per
formance suffers without 
Internet Explorer?
To me, it looks like the Depart
ment of Justice is about to win, 
which would cause Microsoft to 
be punished, and open the door 
even more for the leaner, more 
stable OS, Linux.
On Intels front, the soon-to-be 
released Pentium III is causing 
a fuss with consumer advocacy 
and privacy groups. The prob
lem stemmed from Intels inno
vative processor ID, which tracks 
the user of the computer, caus
ing Intel to disable the processor 
ID to prevent a boycott. How
ever, consumer advocacy groups 
want the ID to be permanently 
removed from the processor. 
Not to mention that Intels 
Pentium III is really just a 
Pentium Pro (circa 1995) with 
70 additional instructions and a 
higher clock speed  nothing 
too innovative about that. The 
processor ID is Intels stupidest 
PR ploy ever (and its worst at
tempt to one-up the competition), 
and its backfiring on them. Why 
would anyone want Intel to track
of failure
who they are by the computer 
they use? It can also open up 
new security flaws, in which 
savvy crackers could write a soft
ware program to disguise their 
processor ID as someone elses. 
If Intel keeps the processor 
ID on the chip, many people 
are just going to buy computers 
driven by rival AMDs 
microprocessors.
AMDs processors do not have 
the processor ID, and from see
ing the reaction of consumer ad
vocacy groups to Intel, they prob
ably will not add them. Their 
forthcoming K6-3 microproces
sor is faster than a similarly 
clocked Pentium II or Pentium
III, and the company just struck 
a deal with Gateway, a company 
long thought to be loyal to Intel 
only. Provided that they can sup
ply an ample amount of chips 
and keep the K7 (their next chip, 
running on Compaqs extremely 
fast Alpha bus) on schedule, they 
have quite an opportunity for 
plucking away Intels market 
share, especially since Intel just 
screwed up big time.
With the stupid decisions that 
the two computer industry gi
ants have made, the alternative 
solutions may become the pri
mary solutions, and cause a 
large shift in the computer 
industry. The giants have just 
stumbled; lets hope the under
dog can push them down 
farther. The next slogans will 
then be:
Intel Inside and designed for 
Windows no more.
Authentic AMD and Linux for 
the 21st century.
And then computer users will 
be able to rejoice that their 
computers wont crash when 
they were just about to finish 
that hundred-page paper they 
were writing.

History & Sex: Using Recent Trends to Deal with Current Core 
Problems
McConomy Auditorium
Peter Stearns, Dean, College of H&SS
This talk will focus on the main trends of sexual outlook and behavior in 20thcentury America and what the results are in terms of current worries and 
opportunities. The discussion and presentation will include questions and 
comments to and from the audience, and will try also to assess why sex worries 
Americans more than it does some other people, and whether these worries 
are necessary.
This program examines what we may infer from the Bible about the intended 
(permitted and blessed) benefits of sex. Many people are familiar with 
prohibitions in the Bible regarding some expressions of sex. The Bible also 
claims that God is the creator of our sexuality, a creative work he assessed as 
good. In addition, the Bible acknowledges several positive purposes of sex 
within the boundaries of moral living.
You will be learning the Merengue - night club style (Down and dirty) a few 
moves from the movie. No experience required! By the end of the night you'll

This program will discuss some of the common uses and abuses of drugs at 
CMU. Substances often associated with sex such as E and alcohol will be 
the focus. Myths and facts will be explained about these so-called aphrodisiacs. 
The date rape drugs like GHB and Roofies will be also be covered.

Wendy Shalit, Carnegie Mellon InterFaith Council
Were the Victorian's really as repressed as we imagine? This program argues that 
modesty is not a social construct nor a form of prudery, but a natural reponse and way 
to preserve the erotic in our lives. Is our "let-it-all-hang-out" mentality, centered on 
overcoming "hang-up"s, fundamentally flawed? Shalit argues that without those 
misnamed "hang-ups", there can be no true surrender, no richness, no depth to relations 
between the sexes.UIvuItvo93 Pe.BK.UAK.Y l^, 1999

Greed rules pro sports
A fans opinion
by Matt Brun
The shortened National Bas
ketball Association season got 
underway last Friday to a welldeserved ho-humfrom the fans. 
Finally, fans are showing the 
world of professional sports that 
the universe does not revolve 
around them and we can sur
vive just fine without them.
For the third time in the past 
five years, one of the big four 
professional sports (hockey, 
baseball, football, and basket
ball) cancelled part of a season 
due to labor strife. In other 
words, a bunch of multimillionares were arguing with 
a bunch of billionares, trying to 
get even more millions.
When exactly did sports becomeso important that the men
who play them are worth more 
money than anyone not named 
Bill Gates or Donald Trump? 
These arent world leaders or 
people saving the world  
theyre just athletes.
The rapid escalation of sala
ries for professional athletes is 
staggering. Just two years ago, 
Kevin Garnett became 
basketballs first $20-million 
man. Just a matter of months 
ago, baseballs Kevin Brown 
became the first player in any 
sport to sign for $100 million. 
At this rate, where will it all 
end? Salaries have become 
more of a status symbol than a 
measure of what a player is 
actually worth.
During the NBA lockout, the 
players tried to generate fan 
sympathy by protesting that 
they couldnt live without their 
$2 million a year. People all 
over the country live quite com
fortably on $60,000 to $80,000. 
Are we really supposed to be
lieve that professional athletes 
need more than 10 times that 
amount each year to survive?
At the short end of this power 
struggle is the fans. To pay the 
exorbitant salaries the players 
are demanding and still make a 
profit, the owners raise prices for 
tickets over and over, and still 
expect the fans to buy them up. 
To date, the National Hockey 
League is setting the pace in the 
race to price their games out of 
the reach of their fans. Standard 
prices for average seats are in the 
$30 range, while lower-level seat
ing jumps to over $70.
With every indication pointing 
to continued rise in salaries, ticket 
prices will have to rise as well to 
match them. Unfortunately, 
there is nothing the fans can do 
about it, but hope the players and 
owners come to their senses. If 
that doesnt happen, it wont be 
long before professional athletes 
are the only ones able to afford to 
see their own games.
Matt Brun is a first-year sports 
nut majoring in electrical and 
computer engineering. He appre
ciates all thoughtful responses to 
his views.
Early struggles 
result in losses
MEN, from page 12 stole a game from them two weeks
feat, dropping their UAA reago, the Brandeis Judges. Carnegie 
cord to 2-7. Mellon was winning late in that
We have to do a better job of contest, but could not hang on for 
making opponents work for the win, losing by one point, 76-75,- 
shots, said Wingen. Basically in the closing seconds, 
we have to generate offense with All we had to do is make a few 
our defense. defensive stops and some free throws
----------------------------------------------------------------- and we didnt,If we continue improving 
on defense, were going 
to see a few more wins 
before the season's over."
 coach Tony Wingen
With the young team that we 
have, I was expecting wed 
struggle at the beginning of the 
season.... I expected to win more, 
though, to be honest, he said.
The Tartans had little time to 
recover from the loss, however, 
as they were back in action Sun
day afternoon versus a team that
we
said Wingen.
He put a lot of 
weight on the 
rematch Sunday. 
This is a game that 
will set the tone for 
the future. We both 
have young teams. 
We will see them for 
the next three years 
so we have to send the message 
that were better than you.  
Overall, Wingen remains positive 
about the team and the rest of the 
season. This is a good, hard-work
ing bunch of guys. If we continue 
improving on defense, were goingto 
see a few more wins before the 
seasons over.

were still 10 minutes left in the period. Time 
passed quickly it seemed, and CMU was unable 
to tie the game. Finally, CMU resorted to pulling 
the goaltender with a minute left in the game. 
Slippery Rock sealed their victory with an open 
net goal with five seconds remaining. The final 
score was 5-3.
On Saturday evening, CMU had the misfor
tune of playing Allegheny College at Neville Ice 
Arena in the South Side. Allegheny appeared at 
first to be interested only in knocking over as 
many of their opponents as possible. They soon 
got bored of this and showed their finesse with a 
goal at 3:43. However, CMU was playing well
this period and managed two goals in the last two 
minutes by Steve Leonhardt and Fitzgerald, re
spectively. The period ended on an optimistic note 
for the Tartans.
This false sense of security was quickly crushed 
during the second period. Allegheny dealt out nu
merous tough hits on Carnegie Mellon players. In 
addition, the presence of three extremely skilled 
players on their roster resulted in an onslaught of 
five Allegheny goals in the period. The third period 
turned out to be a repeat of the second. CMU was 
unable to score any goals while Allegheny added 
more to their tally.
CMtFs next home game will be on Saturday, 
February 13 against Penn State West.

NYU, meanwhile, showed yet

power, switching easily from a 
quick, slashing style to one built 
on ball movement and outside 
shooting. The Violets passed the 
ball with a cool efficiency that 
routinely ended with open looks 
at the basket. In sharp contrast 
to CMUs struggles from the floor, 
NYU nailed almost every shot 
they attempted, from every part 
of the court. By halftime, the 
Tartans were in a 31-point

In simple terms, the second half

Friday night Slippery Rock 
hosted Carnegie Mellon at Blade
Runners ice rink in Cranberry, 
Penn. Although the Tartans 
matched Slippery Rocks style of 
play, the opposition scored the 
only goal of the first period at
12:38. The remainder of the first 
period was well-fought by CMU, 
but the team was unable to put 
the puck in the net.
The second period started out 
badly for CMU as Slippery Rock 
managed to score 11 seconds into 
the period. The Tartans did not 
let this blow affect their play, 
however, and continued to work 
hard. It just seemed like things 
were not going well for CMU  
the puck was taking strange 
bounces which all seemed to ben
efit Slippery Rock. The game ap
peared to be a lost cause when 
Slippery Rock scored their third 
goal with' 51 seconds remaining 
in the second period.
Whatever coach Maddalena 
said to the players in the locker 
room before the third period re
ally worked, as the Tartans en
tered the third ready to play. CMU 
scored two goals in the first 
minute of play, both by fifth-year
senior Scott Fitzgerald. Slippery 
Rock stepped up their play to 
match CMU, and had several good 
scoring opportunities. Great 
goaltendingby graduate student
Jon Kliegman kept the game close 
all throughout the period.
At 13:30, CMU tied the game 
when Steve Woods scored. This 
tie did not last for long, however,
as Slippery Rock beat Kliegman 
two minutes later. The game was 
still looking good, though; the Tar
tans were playing well, and there

The CMU mens basketball team is 
struggling. Theres no other way to say 
it. Owners of a 5-12 record and losers of 
eight of their last 10, the team was 
coming off a close, hard-fought loss ver
sus University Athletic Association 
front-runner Washington University last 
Sunday, January 31. Looking to bounce 
back and gain some ground in the UAA, 
the Tartans took to the court last Friday 
in Skibo Gym to challenge another UAA 
foe, New York University.
There were two phases of their game 
that we felt we needed to do a good job 
defending, said head coach 
Tony Wingen. One was their big center, 
and the other wastheir threepoint shooters.
The Tartans had already been burned 
by this attack once this season, losing at 
NYU 77-66 on January 24. The Violet 
offense seemed simple enough  have 
the big man underneath dominate the 
boards, take up two or three defenders, 
and free up the sharp shooters outside 
the three-point stripe. Defending it was 
another issue.
NYU jumped out to an early 10-7 
lead, and the game quickly became very 
physical. Despite multiple field goals by 
senior Dan Bowersox, junior Brad 
McNutt, and first-year student Ralph 
Deabrunzzo, the team saw themselves 
doubled up for much of the first half. 
They were 2-13 from three-point range 
and had only a 33 percent overall field 
goal percentage, compared to NYUs 9- 
14, 59.4 percent.
We let them get a lot of shots 
we didnt want them to get" 
 head coach Tony Wingen
We shot very poorly in the first half, 
said Wingen. We were settling for threepoint shots that werent good attempts. 
The half ended with the Tartans in a 21- 
point hole, 42-23.
First-year student Ralph Deabrunzzo had 13 points versus NYU,
Part of the first half s disappointing 
performance may have been due to the 
fact that a number of Tartans were strug
gling with injury or the flu bug.
We just didnt have the energy we 
needed to play the game, said Wingen.
McNutt, senior Tommy Praesel, and
--------------------- first-year Dean
DuBois all came down 
with the flu earlier in 
the week, but played 
nevertheless. Firstyear John Poling suf
fered a concussion in 
practice on Tuesday 
and was out for the game, and a number 
of Tartans were banged up from the 
everyday grind of the season.
Weve been pretty lucky as far as 
injuries this year, said Wingen. Other
than the loss of [se
nior Chris Butsko 
(knee injury)] at the 
beginning of the year, 
weve been fortunate 
the injury bug has not 
hit us until now. Now, 
however, its like a big 
snowball rolling 
over us.
In spite of the inju
ries, the Tartans 
came out fired up in 
the second half. 
They went on a 15-3 
run on the strength 
of great play by 
Praesel, McNutt, and 
Deabrunzzo and 
pulled to within 10 
points at 48-38. CMU 
could not hold off the 
NYU attack long 
enough, however, and 
after draining a num
ber of outside shots, 
the lead inflated once 
again and the score 
was 62-42 NYU with 
six minutes left.
We did a good job 
with the big guy, but 
not the shooters, said 
Wingen. We let them 
get a lot of shots we didnt want 
them to get.
Just when the game seemed out of 
reach for the Tartans, they made an
other surge. This time, the streak was 
characterized by frantic play from 
number of Tartans and exceptional de
fensive pressure by first-year Ryan 
Willumson. A field goal by first-year 
Dom Ionadi with three minutes left in 
the game drew the Tartans within strik
ing distance again at 71-60.
The Violets outside shooting game 
was too much for the Tartans to handle 
late in the game, however, and a number 
of strikes from downtown maintained 
the double-digit margin. Despite a solid 
second half and a great late effort, the 
Tartans fell to their second straight dePlease see MEN, page 9

Students delve into computer culture
I
Format incites legal stir
By SRIRAM GOLLAPALLI
Tartan Staffwriter
The recent explosion of MPEG Audio Layer 
Format 3 files (MP3s) allows users to have 
a variety of different music stored on 
their computer to accomodate their mixed 
tastes. On the other hand, this quick growth 
has also sparked a major increase in copy
right law violations.
MP3 is a file format which stores music files 
on a computer in such a way that the file size 
is relatively small, but the song sounds very 
close to CD quality. MP3 compresses highquality sound files so they can be downloaded 
quickly onto a PC hard drive. The size of an 
MP3 file is typically 1 megabyte (MB) per 
minute of music. The Moving Pictures 
Experts Group (MPEG) standard is a method 
for compressing sound and movie files into a 
managable format for downloading or stream
ing across the Internet.
One can use MP3 songs legal! 
if the songs copyright holde 
gave permission to download an< 
play the song. It is also legal t 
make copies from a CD that yoi 
bought for your own personal Uo^. 
it is illegal to encode MP3s from CD and then 
distribute them to others unless you have 
permission from the copyright holder.
The main issue concerning MP3s is 
whether or not any given individual has copy
righted materials available to others in viola
tion of US copyright laws, said John Lerchey, 
the distributed workstations services coordi
nator in Computing Services. The bigger 
issue is when there is a directory full of MP3s 
on the network that is available to a vast 
number of people  this is absolutely illegal. 
Nevertheless, there are many students who 
enjoy listening to these files around campus. 
I am a big fan of MP3s, said first-year MCS 
Chris Anderson. A huge percentage of people 
I know have them. I think theyre unstop
pable from the administrative point of view. 
Theyre convenient especially for cheap col
lege students, said Naseer Siddique, a firstyear electrical and computer engineering 
major. I dont think MP3s will replace CDs 
because artists dont make 
money from MP3s. When 
artists stop making 
money, then they will 
stop making new
The administration does not proactively 
look for MP3s, according to Lerchey. Howev
er, if we get a report about high traffic on one 
area of'the campus network, we will try to 
resolve the issue by looking at the machines 
that receive a lot of traffic, he said. If we 
find that the machine is serving MP3s to 
many people, the person who owns the 
machine will lose network access for the 
remainder of that semester.
Despite the universitys best attempts, 
many people do not think that the pirated 
MP3s can be stopped. Its impossible to stop 
them because they have already been estab
lished so well, said John Hursh, sophomore 
creative writing and philosophy major.
I doubt they are going to be stopped, said 
senior business major Chad Agena, I know a 
lot of people who download all kinds of stuff 
from the network.
But not everyone on campus views this 
medium as unstoppable or even attractive.
here are other students
who believe that MP3s ar 
overrated.
My discerning tastes ar 
not met by the MP3 aud: 
ence, said first-year BEL 
student Ben King. Theyr 
convenient, but you get sic 
of hearing the same song a 
the time.
I think people are mat 
ing a big deal of MP3s, sai 
sophomore business majo 
Harry Tsang. People mak 
mix tapes of songs they lik 
all the time  its like th 
same thing.
There are also many lege

Mail plays essential part
By GREG NOFI
Tartan Features Editor
More than ever, students using the Andrew Mes
sage System (AMS) are facing a recurring obstacle 
whenever they are unable to electronically mail a 
file from their Windows or Macintosh computer. 
Cyrus users will get impatient when they realize 
that they cannot post to a restricted bulletin board 
unless they have an AMS account. How much 
longer is this duality of email servers going to be 
implemented? Like many construction projects 
around campus, CMU is also in a transition phase 
of university-wide networks.
The service in place right now is the Andrew 
system, a university-wide network maintained by 
the Computing Services division. In addition to 
email and bulletin boards, the Andrew system also 
provides file storage, notification services, and a 
number of applications developed specifically for 
the network. The system was originally designed 
to service only UNIX clients, with modifications 
for Windows and Macintosh several years later. 
The implementation of a campus-wide network 
was called for by Richard Cyert, CMU President 
between 1972 and 1990.
[Plans for Andrew] started in 1982 when Cyert 
announced that CMU was going to become a com
puter university ... where every faculty member 
and student would have their own workstation, 
said James Morris, head of the Computer Science 
Department. Morris was also the director of the 
Information Technology Center, a group funded by 
IBM to develop Andrew.
Cyerts decision to install this system was most
ly motivated by a dissatisfaction with the time
sharing system then in use and the potential for 
CMU to become an active leader in personal com
puting. Before the Andrew system, the main com
puting facilities were located on the third floor of 
Wean Hall where large mainframe computers 
were time-shared from various dialup termi
nals around campus. The goal of Andrew was 
to allow a user from any networked computer 
access to such resources.
[Personal computing] was considered the 
wave of the future, and Cyert said that we 
should change the face of CMU to be prepared for 
this trend, said Morris.
When the system was finally completed, there 
was a contest to decide what the name of the net
work should be. Saint Andrew was considered 
heavily, but it was eventually shortened to 
Andrew in honor of Andrew Carnegie and Andrew 
Mellon. There was another reason to choose this 
name, however.
The name also came in the alphabet before 
Athena, which was the name of a comparable pro
ject at MIT around that time, said Morris.
Even though the AMS system used some of the 
most advanced technology at that time, it began to 
show its age after several years of increasing usage 
as more and more non-UNIX platforms emerged. 
Research centers and departments depended heavWINAMP
ily on the accessibility of AMS, 
while students used email to com
municate with others just as much 
as the phone. Computing services 
had trouble developing clients for 
use on Windows and Macintosh 
machines. For example, while the 
UNIX client Sendmessages is able 
to handle MIME-encoded file 
attachments, EzMail and 
MacMail do not support this 
feature. A decade after 
Andrews implementation, it 
became clear that a new cam
pus network was needed.
Andrew II is the project in 
progress right now that is 
trying to accomplish a more 
integrated computing envi
ronment.
The purpose of Andrew II 
is to address the incorpora
tion of personal computers 
and Macintoshes into the 
network, said Brian Ben
nett of Computing Services.
This is important since few 
students have a UNIX workstation box 
on their desks.
The Andrew II network will feature 
Cyrus, an electronic mail and bulletin 
board system that utilizes the Internet 
Message Access Protocol (IMAP4). 
The IMAP4 protocol allows the user to 
access all emails and address books 
directly from the server. This is good 
news since it can be used by many dif
ferent platforms. Moreover, since 
IMAP4 is a common protocol,
o
j kbps   jkHz
there are outside vendors 
who make applications that can be 
used with Cyrus.
With Cyrus, because its standardsbased, we have a choice of clients that we can use', 
said Joseph Jackson of Applications System 
Development, who is involved with the Cyrus pro
ject. We dont have to write and maintain [the 
clients] ourselves.
Computing Services has evaluated the increas
ing number of mail clients that support IMAP4, 
including Pine, Mulberry, and Simeon, the clients 
guarenteed to support the basic email and bboard 
needs for the campus community. Of these three, 
however, Mulberry is recommended for use on 
both the Macintosh and Windows platforms. It is 
favored because it supports many features need
ed to use email at CMU while supporting stu
dents who check their email on more than one 
computer. This is known 
as nomadic usage.
Things started back in 
the fall of 1996 when we 
announced that the Cyrus 
server was going into pro
duction and that anybody 
who wants to use it can 
convert and use it, said 
Jackson. And recently, 
this freshman class was 
given Cyrus accounts 
instead of AMS accounts.

Time out...Photo showing graces 
local black community
A student relaxes one leisurely afternoon to read at Phipps Conservatory.
By LISETTE MILLER-DIXON
Tartan Managing Editor
In the 1960s, images on television 
and in other media helped turn a 
grassroots civil-rights protest into a 
national movement. The University 
Center Art Gallery has chosen Lily 
Chang, a resident of Pittsburgh, to 
help celebrate Black History Month.
Changs exhibit, entitled Amazing 
Grace, is a photographic documenta
tion of the black community in East 
Liberty. This show is Changs second in 
the UC since she has moved to Pitts
burgh. The images collect
ed over the past two years 
vary from religious scenes 
gathered at East Liberty 
Presbyterian Church to 
portraits of children play
ing in the street.
Overall this work repre
sents an Asian womans 
point of view, said Chang.
I try my very best to 
understand other races as well as 
my own. Coming from Taiwan 
we never got in touch with AfricanAmericans. Our views growing up in 
the 60s and 70s were greatly influ
enced by the media. I identify some of 
my own struggles with that of the 
black community.
The artists statement at the exhibit 
explains that coming into Pittsburgh, 
Chang found herself alone, homeless, 
and pregnant. She explains that the 
black community helped her through 
this time in her life and continues to 
support her.
It was the black community that 
took me in, helped me, nurtured me, 
Chang said in her artists statement. 
When I decided to take up the camera 
in March 1997, there was no question 
that the Pittsburgh black community 
would be my center of focus.
Alongside of the artist statement is a 
photograph of the late Teenie Harris, 
to whom Chang has dedicated the 
exhibit. Harris was a Pittsburgh pho
tographer who documented the black 
community for over 50 years. Chang 
explains that Harris was a hero to her 
and that he was always very support
ive of her work.
The exhibit is divided into several 
small segments. There are a few pho
tographs taken of a family Chang calls 
the Homemakers Family as well as
some of Sala Udin in the March for 
Freedom. The majority of the pho
tographs in the exhibit are from 
church gatherings and at the funerals 
of both Ms. Bell and Theme Harris. 
Photographs of gospel singers in 
Urban League Sunday  Voices of 
Faith, reflect Changs own passion in 
singing as well as her dedication to the 
church. The three pieces titled Ms. 
Bells Funeral #1, 2, 3 show Changs 
perspective on grieving. Included in 
this section is a silhouetted image of 
a woman in a dark light, a single cas
ket in the center of an empty room,
and a lily poking through a rusting 
metal gate.
She has her history up on the wall 
over there, said Charlotte Yano, an 
alumna of the School of Art. I think 
one of the most interesting things is 
she tells her story through the stories 
of others.
She captures the moments and emo
tions ... and makes the viewer feel like 
they are part of the exhibit, said 
Gretchen Dematera, a masters student 
in public policy and management and 
University Center Art Gallery manager. 
It makes you feel as if you are standing 
right next door [to the subject].
Separate from the rest of the pho
tographs in the exhibit is a picture of a 
lotus pool with a short statement 
explaining its importance. We must be 
nourished by our own unseen connec
tions  those connections are 
strengthened by understanding. They 
are nourished by awareness of our dif
ferences ... and most importantly, these 
connections are sustained by compas
sion, appreciation of these differences.
Amazing Grace will be on display 
until February 13 in the UC Art 
Gallery. The gallery is located on the 
first floor next to the Information Desk.
The next exhibit, ^Eighty-Six Cries 
for Justicef by Ignacio Fillipini, will 
run from February 15 to 26.
I think one of the most 
interesting things is that 
she tells her story through 
the stories of others.

Students in GSIA have a rep

the point of obsession. They 
also have a reputation for being 
just as willing to put their

Minnie Ko: We have athlete

cheerer or personally worked 
with the athletes?
MK: We spend most of the 
time just talking to the ath

any other kind of volunteer 
efforts.... Having a conversa

than with any other person.

that gap?

siastic. Youre cheering them 
on, and they become excited. 
[The event] allows you to have 
an intimate situation with a 
person you hardly know.
TT: Why is this type of work 
important for people to do?
MK: I think people need to 
find a balance between work 
and personal life. Thats 
enhanced by what they do for 
the community and that trans
making money, but these athlates into positive things you
can bring to the workplace. 
There are more and more orga
nizations encouraging their 
workers to volunteer. Its not 
just all about the bottom line; 
its about bring a positive per
spective to the community.
TT: Would you ever seriously 
consider working for a non
profit organization?
CR: It seems like sometimes 
you can make more of a differ
ence working for a nonprofit 
organization. Maybe later in 
life Ill consider it as a full
time job.
MK: In a nonprofit youre not 
just increasing the shareholder 
value. In some businesses, you. 
dont get that immediate feed
back that you get when you vol
unteer. You might see kids who 
come from a difficult home, or 
who have a handicap. You see 
how your help will impact their 
life for the future. When youre 
creating shareholder value, 
youre just making a whole lot 
of people money. This is a dif
ferent thing. I know at Deloitte 
Consulting, one of the things 
were measured on is how much 
time we give back to the com
munity. Theyre realizing how 
much people should have per
spective on life around them. 
You have to be a real person, 
not just like a machine ... dri

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  8 February 1999L3
Lecturer predicts spirtual machines in future
By ROSIE JONES
Tartan Staffwriter 
& MATTHEW SIEGLER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
 Ray KurzweiFs new book, The 
Age of Spiritual Machines, is 
subtitled When Computers 
Exceed Human Intelligence. 
Kurzweils vision may seem 
incredible, but he identified 
CMU as a center for bringing 
this vision to reality.
Coming to CMU to talk about 
Artificial Intelligence is like 
bringing coals to Newcastle, he 
said in the opening words of his 
talk at the School of Computer 
Science last Thursday. I love 
coming to CMU because the 
demos always work.
Kurzweil demonstrated 
speech recognition technology 
based on his own research at the 
start of his talk. He pioneered 
products in reading systems for the 
blind using speech-to-text technology.
His talents at helping others see 
extends to visionary accounts of the 
fiiture of technology. We will meet nonbiological entities who will claim to be 
human, to feel, and think, and to have 
spiritual experiences.... They will be 
very convincing, he said.
Kurzweils talk was packed, with 
many students, professors, and even 
President Jared Cohon forced to turn 
away as all 257 seats in Wean Hall 
7500 were taken, and people filled the

Attendees of Kurzweils artificial intelligence lecture completely filled Wean 7500.
aisles. We recorded the talk on video, 
and copies will be available in the 
library for courses and individuals by 
the end of the week, said Catherine 
Copetas, assistant dean of industrial
advancement is now reaching the point 
where artificial intelligence (AI) tech
nology will take off and explode.
Right now AI is dominated by idiot 
savants, capable of highly specialized
and alumni relations for the School of tasks, like playing master chess, as
Computer Science.
Kurzweil ascribed his optimism to the 
evolutionary growth of computer tech
nology and backed up his argument 
with Moore's Law, which originally stat
ed that the capacity of integrated cir
cuits doubles every 18 months. He sug
gested that this accelerating pace of
exemplified by Big Blue, the CMU-originated, IBM-developed computer pro
gram which defeated Garry Kasparov, 
the reigning human world chess cham
pion in 1997.
In general, AI work is initially dis
missed as being unfeasible, but gradu
ally projects develop amazing capabilities, said Kurzweil. I like visiting 
CMU every few years, to see ongoing 
progress which is apparent. CMU does 
leading work in the field.
It was so bad that someone with his 
technological background would say 
that kind of thing: just plotting graphs 
and saying its bound to happen,  said 
Daniel Nikovski, a graduate student in 
the Robotics Institute.
One goal that Kurzweil stated is to 
inform the public of the impact of future 
technology. People accept more and 
more that machines are clever, but not 
that they can have plans, intentions, 
and even audiences and artistic agen
das, Kurzweil said. He sees the future 
as changing even that. The impact can 
be constructive or destructive; the story 
hasnt been written.
Kurzweil sees progress as ________
being inexorable. Ethics 
issues are stones in the 
stream, he said. He sees pos
sible dangers both from selfreplicating nano-robots out of 
control, and in the use of 
technology for the 1984 vision 
of peoples every move being 
monitored. So far it hasnt 
worked out that way. Things j 
are too decentralized.
He suggests that machines of the 
future will be a part of us. They will 
have our knowledge and capabilities, 
and will even claim to have spiritual 
experiences. He leaves their actual sub
ject experience as an open question. 
One student in the audience asked at
the end of the talk, Will we want to cre
ate such machines?
Kurzweil sees the ethical decisions 
we need to make as continually taking 
place on a daily basis. Its in the choic
es we make about how to deploy tech
nology, and what projects we under-; 
take. My own work addresses issues 
that are empowering.
The response to Kurzweils talk by 
both students and faculty was strong. 
Ive heard so many talks like his. He; 
equates computational capacity with; 
intelligence, said Sebastian Thrunassistant professor in the computer sci-; 
ence department and the Robotics Insti
tute. The reality is that within AI the; 
goal of the omnipotent machine is dying 
out. Few projects are trying to build; 
that kind of machine.
I like visiting CMU... to 
see ongoing progress which 
is apparent. CMU does lead
ing work in the field. 
 Ray Kurzweil
At the end, a blind man approached; 
the podium to thank Kurzweil for the; 
way his research on reading machines 
for the blind had changed his life. Like 
the blind man, Kurzweil hopes he can 
help us all to open our eyes, and really 
see what lies ahead.Music takes to the road
MP3, from page LI
engine, recently implemented 
an MP3 search engine.
In a press release from last 
Wednesday, the Recording 
Industry Association of Ameri
ca (RIAA) stated that it has 
spoken with Lycos about the 
engine and has committed to 
work the company to develop 
procedures to eliminate 
infringing sites from its direc
tory. Lycos also indicated 
intent to fulfill its obligations 
under the newly enacted Digi
tal Millennium Copyright Act. 
This act requires Lycos to take 
appropriate action whenever it 
become aware of an infringing 
musical recording. The RIAA is 
one of the major organizations 
trying to contain the spread of 
illegal MP3 s.
There are several portable 
MP3 players out on the market. 
Diamond Multimedias Rio is 
the first to be sold in the United 
States. The format and Rio have 
faced stiff opposition from mem
bers of the recording industry, 
who are worried about potential 
piracy problems.
Rios release was almost 
blocked by the RIAA when the 
group tried to delay the release 
of the Rio by filing for a tempo
rary injunction. The motion was 
denied in early October. Never
theless, the RIAA is expected to 
file an appeal.
Regardless of the controversy, 
since the Rios launch in
November, Diamond has 
shipped 100,000 units in the 
United States. The Rio can hold 
about 60 minutes of MP3- 
encoded music on its initial 32 
MB of memory. Since the Rio 
has no moving parts, the player 
does not tend to skip when 
shaken or jostled.
The next generation of Win
dows CE-based palm-size PCs 
will be the next wave of portable 
MP3 players. However, since 
most contain only 8 to 16 MB of 
memory, it will limit the 
amount of music you can store 
on them.
The MPMan from Saehan 
Information has a fast transfer 
rate between the PC and player, 
and is compact, light, and 
extremely sturdy One of the 
models contains up to 2 giga
bytes of space. The H10 carries 
an internal hard drive that 
stores between 360 and 2048 
MB. Saehan is also releasing 
plenty of accessories to go with 
the player, including a cigarette 
jack power supply and a tape 
converter so you can listen to 
your MP3s while driving down 
the highway.
We developed new versions 
of MPMan. The prices are not 
determined.... It is planned to 
be released new MPMan prod
ucts one by one from about this 
March 1999, said Yoonjoo Lee 
of Saehan Information Systems. 
The MP-F10 is the current 
model; the MP-F30 is the new
design, with up to 128MB, 
remote control earphone, voice 
memory, and electronic memo, 
which should be released first 
quarter 1999.
The U-FI from Cambridge 
design is a lot smaller than a 
credit card. A flash card, about 
32 MB, is the storage device. 
You will have the ability to cus
tomize your listening environ
ment. The player includes a dig
ital equalizer and audio com
pressor that store your choice of 
settings for each specific track. 
This will arrive in stores around 
spring of 1999.
It seems that MP3s will 
remain a popular music medi
um for many years. As these 
new players become more main
stream, we will see them appear 
around campus to facilitate the 
digital music revolution.

EMAIL, page LI
around four years, all the stu
dents will be using Cyrus.
Even though Cyrus is stable 
and efficient, there are some 
features that are not available 
simply because email clients 
cannot support them yet. For 
example, instead of merely 
selecting Post like AMS users, 
Cyrus users must type post+ 
and the name of the bboard 
when posting to an AMS bul
letin board. In addition, there 
are some restricted bboards 
that Cyrus users cannot post 
to. Computing Services hopes 
that email clients will eventual

But at the moment, student 
reaction to the current state of

mixed. Many upperclassmen

I prefer AMS because Im 
used to EzMail, I like EzMail, 
and halfway through my senior 
year at CMU, I dont see any 
reason why I should be chang
ing anything, said Eugene 
Kim, a senior social and deci
sion sciences major. Its not 
broken, so I dont see any need 
to fix it.
Nevertheless, there are also 
seniors who have converted to 
Cyrus and favor it over AMS.

I like Cyrus mainly because; 
of the choice of mail clients. I 
dont have to run the one creat-. 
ed by Computing Services,; 
which I may or may not want to; 
use, said Robert Watson, a; 
senior philosophy major. I; 
would imagine that the AMS; 
bboard features that Cyrus; 
doesnt support will exist within; 
a year or so.
Whether CMU likes it or not,; 
the once-powerful AMS will be;

Being a rock and roll star is strenuous 
and unrewarding. Writing lyrics is difficult for 
rhyming is a clever activity and a command 
of one's native language is necessary.
"I liked these two girls, but they liked each 
other/1 guess I'm screwed cuz they're 
teenage bisexual lovers/ She went for a girl 
cuz she couldn't get a guy/ Now she's going 
with a guy so I guess she's bl"
The word "cuz" is quite advanced and 
misunderstood by common folk. Tackling 
controversial social issues such as sexuality 
can puta rock and roll star under persecution 
for his or her beliefs. Rock stars have 
sometimes been referred to as "drunken male 
sluts", "rebels without causes", "sissy la-la's", 
"sociopathic pathetic satanic cultist 
sympathizers", and even stupidheads".
These insults from the greater masses 
are obviously attacks from the ignorant who 
fear the awesome power of the words and 
actions of the genius 'rock star'. The average 
person, when tortured for days on end and 
reduced to an animalistic state, will agree 
that they fear one day the 'rock star' will rule 
the cosmos. After all the cosmos is made up 
largely of rocks and stars (clever ain't it?).
Parallels can be drawn between the 
unjustified degradation of the 'rock star' 
and the persecution of great minds such as 
Bob Dole and Galileo. "Rocker" Tommy Lee is 
an outstanding example of the intelligence and 
worldliness the 'rockstar' possesses, 
his interests span from rock and roll 
to independent filming, [email: jpkenney,

Youve gotta have heart
Sometimes Cupid misses his target
By KATIE KOWALL
Tartan Staffwriter
Valentines Day sucks. 
Mind you, if I had been 
asked my feelings on the 
holiday about a year ago, I 
would have stared into space 
with love-struck eyes and 
thought fondly of my highschool sweetheart, who would 
shower me with poetry and 
roses on the holiday.
No such luck this year. 
The high-school 
sweetheart of 
yesterday is long 
gone, and the 
warm fuzzy feeling 
for February 14 has 
left along with him. 
The possibility of 
Valentines Day being 
spent in the pleasant com
pany of me-myself-and-I 
could very well become a 
reality. But this is coun
tered by the ever
present hope that, by 
some miracle, a 
charming academic 
who also happens to have 
money, a nice car, a love of 
theater, and dimples, will spon
taneously show up at my door, 
profess his undying love, and be 
devoted to me forever. This hope 
is what keeps me from becoming 
a total cynic, i.e. dressingin black, 
blasting Marilyn Manson out of 
my window, and cursing men as 
evil beasts. Yes, Valentines Day 
is definitely designed solely for
the pleasure of those who are 
in love.
Dont get me wrong, I think 
Valentines Day is a great holi
day when handled correctly. Take 
elementary school for example. 
The plan is a splendid one: Ev
eryone spends weeks designing a 
really cool little box, and each 
student is forced to give each or 
his of her classmates a Valen
tine. They are cheap, impersonal, 
and all you have to do is write 
your name on the back.
But, as the years pass, the 
stakes on Valentines Day are 
raised. As soon as the hormones 
kick in, we start assessing 
whether Timmy or Susie gave a 
nicer Valentine to us than they 
gave to Amy or Billy, who hap
pens to be the only other person 
in the fourth grade who is vying 
for Timmy or Susies affection.
Subtle nuances like special 
friend versus cool friend 
become earth-shattering. If 
only Disney and Mattel knew that 
Mickey and Barbie were having 
such profound effects onyoung emotions.
In junior high, pre-adolescents 
are first faced with Valentines 
Day flower sales. You know them 
as well as I do. Student Congress 
sets up shop in the cafeteria sell
ing carnations that are dead by 
the time school lets out in the 
afternoon. But it doesnt matter, 
because its not so much the flower 
but what it stands for.
I remember sitting at lunch 
with my salami sandwich and my
juice box, waiting and hoping that 
maybe that guy from my 
homeroom was buying that car
nation for me. There were always 
those girls who would walk 
through the hall with a whole 
bouquet of those wilting trophies. 
I spent all of seventh grade trying 
to convince everyone that I had 
such a handful of those things 
that I had to leave them in my 
locker because they were too 
much of a hassle. In eighth grade, 
my friends and I wised up and 
started buying each other 
flowers. That took some of the 
pain away.
Valentines Day was definitely 
created for hopeless romantics. 
The aforementioned ex-boyfriend 
would plan for Valentines Day 
for at least a month in advance, 
and shower me with dozens of red 
roses, idyllic poetry, and glutton
ous chocolates.
The first Valentines Day that 
we spent together, I gave him 
socks and a book. However, when 
I gave my presents to him, he 
looked at me like I had just bro
ken the cardinal rule of 
Valentines Day: Ye shall not 
give anything useful.
Valentines Day is all about 
transient tokens, incredibly ex
pensive things that are made even 
more incredibly expensive for 
February 14, all of which die, are 
digested, or are lost in thin air in 
a matter of days. Can we say 
Hallmark Holiday?
There are basically two ways to 
deal with the excessive sentimen
tality and pinkness of Valentines 
Day. The first is to deny its exist
ence. If you really hate it that 
much, spend next Sunday in a 
quiet study carrel on the third 
floor of Hunt Library; no one 
should bother you there. Look at 
happy couples, snicker in their 
general direction, and grumble 
about how their happiness prob
ably wont last long. This is a very 
viable option, but it is also a rather 
lonely one.
The other mechanism for cop
ing is to follow the old adage 
When life gives you lemons, 
make lemonade. Yeah, so youre 
single. Get over it! Last year when 
my man couldnt come home from 
college for Valentines Day, a 
bunch of my friends and I went to 
a Middle Eastern restaurant and 
wallowed our companionless sor
rows in hummus and tabouli. We 
didnt have anyone per se, but we 
had each other.
When it all boils down, the only 
reason anyone really hates 
Valentines Day is because they 
dont have anyone to spend it 
with. Weed out the commercials 
for expensive jewelry and the din
ner specials for two, and basi
cally what youre left with is a 
day meant to thank those whom 
you love and who love you. Maybe 
its not in the romantic sense, but 
it sure is something to be thank
ful for. So when February 14 rolls 
around, give a second thought to 
becoming a recluse and realize 
whats really important in 
your life.
Historians speculate on origins of St. Valentines Day
BY ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter .
February 14, or St. Valentines Day, is 
the time each year when Americans cel
ebrate love and let their loved ones know 
that theyre special. While this idea may 
seem rather sappy to some, Valentines 
Day has nevertheless become one of our 
most popular observances. Each year it 
inspires a frenzy of buying candy, flow
ers, greeting cards, and anything and 
everything shaped like a heart. Yet de
spite such enthusiasm, few know the 
real origins of this day of lovers.
The beginnings of Valentines Day can 
be traced all the way back to the Roman 
empire, but there is still some confusion 
regarding exactly for whom the day was 
named. Some sources claim that St. 
Valentines Day was named after a Ro
man saint, although his beheading in 
270 C.E. seems to have had little to do 
with love. Others believe that the name 
was meant to honor as many as eight 
different saints. In any event, no one is 
certain of how any of these saints be
came the patron saint of lovers. How
ever, there are some theories 
about how the name came to 
be associated with love.
Perhaps the best explanation 
involves the Christian Churchs 
attempt to use St. Valentine as 
a martyr. During the Middle 
Ages, a popular holiday was 
the Roman festival of 
Lupercalia. Part of 
the ceremony in
volved putting 
girls names in a 
box and having 
boys draw them 
out, pairing off 
couples for the 
next year. The 
church attempted to y'y 
make the occasion 
more religious by re
placing girls names 
with the names of saints 
in hopes that each boy would 
model his life after the saint he 
chose. Since St. Valentines death
occurred roughly the same time 
in the calendar year as the festival, 
his name was attached to 
the celebration.
Initially, St. Valentines Day 
caught on quickest in England, 
where many of its modern 
traditions were conceived. 
Englishmen began 
practices like 
writing verses 
and sending 
gifts to loved 
ones. Some 
ideas, like the 
notion that a girl 
should marry the 
first eligible man she 
meets on Valentines 
Day, failed to 
ry\ take hold. 
\y However, the 
British were 
successful at shifting the focus from 
finding a lover to expressing feelings 
to ones significant other. The obser
vation of St. Valentines Day also grew
in popularity in the then-emerging 
United States. Romantic writers from 
Britain came to the U.S. and helped 
shape February 14 into its modern in
carnation. As St. Valentines Day 
gained wider acceptance, it also became 
increasingly profitable. The first mod
ern commercial valentines were intro
duced around 1800, and greeting 
cards eventually became known as 
simply Valentines.
Many of the details of St. Valentines 
Day, such as the use of symbols like 
cupids and hearts to represent love and 
the giving of gifts like chocolates and 
roses, were filled in during the 20th 
century and the remainder of the 19th. 
Giving Valentines has become im
mensely popular  only on Christmas 
are more greeting cards exchanged in 
the United States. Sure, some people 
(generally the ones without dates) may 
grumble when February 14 rolls around, 
but as long as there are men trying to 
gain favor and ladies hoping to receive a 
gift or two, St. Valentines Day should 
continue to come for some time.
Films provide entertainment for rainy holiday evening
BY CLIFF CHBEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Once again, its the time of thp 
year when couples take time 
out to express their love for 
one another.
What better way to romance 
that special someone than witha 
candlelight dinner and snuggling 
to a movie on the couch? Here is 
a rundown on some of the 
best romantic movies made in 
recent years:
5. Sleepless in Seattle (1993, 
directed by Nora Ephron, star
ring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks)
In this romantic comedy, Tom 
Hanks plays a recent widower 
with a young son, Jonah. Sam 
thinks he is ready to get back into 
the dating game, and Jonah is 
looking for a new mother.
One day Jonah describes his 
father on national radio, and as a 
result, hundreds of women be
come interested. One of these 
women, Annie, played by Meg
Ryan, becomes obsessed with 
meeting him. Sparks begin to fly 
and fuzzy feelings begin to emerge 
once she does.
4. The Princess Bride (1987, 
directed by Rob Reiner, starring 
Cary Elwes and Robin 
Wright Penn)
Told by a grandfather to his 
sick grandson, this fantasy/ro
mance comes alive in its telling. 
With guest stars such as Andre 
the Giant and Billy Crystal, you 
cant go wrong. Princess Bride is 
a swashbuckling fairy tale about 
Buttercup, a beautiful young 
woman and her one true love 
Westley, who must find and res
cue her after a long separation.
3. Ghost (1990, directed
by Jerry Zacker, starring Patrick 
Swayze, Demi Moore, and 
Whoopi Goldberg)
Who can forget the theme song 
Unchained Melody when some
one mentions the movie Ghost? 
This is a romantic film in which 
Swayzes character Sam is killed 
at the beginning of the movie. He 
spends the rest of the film in a 
ghostly state trying to warn our 
damsel-in-distress Demi of im
pending danger. The movie is fa
mous for its super-romantic 
pottery scene.
2. William Shakespeares 
Romeo + Juliet (1996, directed 
by Baz Luhrmann, starring 
Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Claire Danes)
Taking place in Verona Beach,
Miami, this film is an MTV-style 
mutation of Shakespeares most 
famous love story. The best scene 
of the movie is when the two 
lovebirds first lay their eyes on 
each other at opposite sides of the 
fish tank during a Montague 
party. With the use of 
Shakespeares original verse in 
this new version of a classic tale, 
can you really get much more 
romantic than lines like: Has 
my heart loved till now? For
swear it, sight! For I never saw a 
true beauty till this night?
1. Titanic (1997, directed by 
James Cameron, starring 
Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Kate Winslet)
While people all over the world 
cried over Leonardo DiCaprios
death in the film, this big-budget 
movie became the winner of 11 
Academy Awards, including Best 
Picture and Best Director. The 
films soundtrack was also the 
bestselling of all time, with more 
than nine million copies 
sold to date, as 
well as being 
named album 
of the year.
With results 
like this, Ti
tanic is by far 
the over
whelming fa
vorite for 
most roman
tic movie of all 
time, even if 
the ship sunk.

[Musical acts spend 
Day, Night wisely
By ROB CULLEN
j Tartan Staffwriter
I This past weekend 
j; the School of Music 
'presented the musi;j*cal A Day in Holly$wood, A Night in the 
Ukraine at the HI
Alumni Concert Hall 'JH
intheCollegeofFine 'jjL M
Arts Building. This 
I was the first time ' ImI
o] nth at I had seen any \
jkind of show that was \ j' j ||li '
(presented by the \ I ||\
 School of Music. I Jl ?i f ffi 1
; was, to say the least, rj W |0/j i* jf\ |M
really impressed. _____ii__W.____zxsGfi  /*? lcS_____
f The show was acJoshua Franzaos
dually a double feaThe School of Music presented two musical one-acts, 
nature consisting of two one-act plays. The plot that served to give direction to the
ftfirst act was A Day in Hollywood, a 
|rl93Gs-style musical revue. Ten sepajl rate musical numbers were tied together 
jtfby the fact that they all related to 1930s 
motion pictures. Aside from Doin the 
^Production Code, which was a spoken 
' iy word, tap-dance number, the songs were 
 ordinary showtunes with somewhat 
idull lyrics.
j However, the musical production and 
|-;the dancing in the show were excellent. 
i;The cast flawlessly worked through the 
^choreography, some of which was veryi
;lintricate, and at times, you could 
only see the dancers feet behind the 
.j singing actors.
One of the more entertaining parts of 
the show was probably in the Richard 
-.Whiting Medley when various cast 
^members played the piano, clarinet, ukuzany Marx Brothers schtick.
Dimitrie Lazich played Groucho Marx, 
who was supposedly playing Serge B. 
Samovar, a Moscow lawyer. His Groucho 
Marx impersonation was accurate. Along 
with Lazich, Jonathan Portera, who 
played Carlo, the widowed Mrs. 
Pavlenkos Italian footman, made a very 
fanny comic team, spouting off the clev
erly inane jokes and puns of the 
Marx Brothers.
Savannah Stevens, who played Mrs. 
Pavlenko, an uppity widow, was a hi
larious straight womon. Christina 
Martos was a convincing Harpo, the 
silent Marx brother with the horn.
The best part of this whole show, 
though, was Kristen Watson, who played 
the maid. All she really did was ran
domly run across the stage and shriek 
when Harpo was chasing her, but itlele, bari sax, some kind of plastic reVcorder thing, and a pair of chopsticks, all just struck me as really funny for 
pretty well. Overall it was a successful 
production of what appeared to be a 
weak show.
The second half of the feature was A 
Night in the Ukraine, a one-act Marx 
Brothers musical. This show had a loose
some reason.
It goes without saying that the people 
in the School of Music are very talented, 
and if you ever get the opportunity you 
should definitely check out one of 
their shows.
Comedy presents quirky look 
at Shakespearean tragedies
By CLINTON FIELD
Tartan Staffwriter
William Shakespeares works came 
from a lifetime spent dedicated to writ
ing and the theatre. Last week, Scotch 
n Soda borrowed the most important, 
meaningful, and dramatic elements 
from this great body of work, threw 
them all away, and presented 
the campus with a hilarious 
evening full of cross-dressing, 
screaming, and audience par
ticipation.
Directed by Donovan Chase, 
the February 5 and 6 showings 
of The Compleat Works of 
WLLM SHKSPR [abridged] 
covered the entirety of 
Shakespeares work with only 
one set and a cast of four. Chris 
Scott, Cheryl Platz, Adam 
Shlian, and John Perkins were 
in turn narrators, actors, and 
impromptu acting workshop 
coaches as they forged through 
each play.
The tone of the production 
was set early, with a short bi
ography of Shakespeare which 
detailed his lesser.-known work 
Mein Kampf and his bloody 
attempt to reestablish Ger
many as a world power in the 
mid-twentieth century.
The cast then moved to Romeo and 
Juliet, presented in a slightly con
densed form. The comedy centered on 
a lascivious Romeo and an obviously 
male and overly excitable Juliet, both 
of whom receive a more thorough treat
ment than most of the other charac
ters in the plays. However, consider
ing the greater familiarity that most 
have with this play than some of the 
more obscure works, this is justifiable.
The other tragedies each received 
their share of attention in turn. Othello 
became a rap; Macbeth was reduced to 
a sword fight with perfect Scottish
accents, and Titus Andronicus hosted a 
cannibalistic cooking show. The title 
characters of Julius Caesar and An
thony and Cleopatra took no more than 
one scene to die.
King Lear tried to escape to the histo
ries, all of which had been condensed 
even further. More than a century of 
British history was summarized in a
their presentation of Hamlet, arguably 
Shakespeares best and most well-known 
play. Chris Scotts heavily pedantic 
Polonius, John Perkins uncertain Ham
let, Adam Shlians flighty, mad Ophelia 
and Cheryl Platzs bad-ass Laertes made 
for an amusingly abridged play, but the 
fun didnt stop there. The super-re-i 
duced minute-long version, the comAnthony DAuria/Tartan Photo Staff

football game in which each king at
tempted to find a suitable heir to pass 
the crown to before the opposing dy
nasty sacked him.
Shakespeares comedies, the largest 
and most formulaic segment of his plays, 
had the most drastic abridgements. Only 
one play remained: a compilation of the 
ridiculous and improbable plot twists 
that Shakespeare often relied on as 
a vehicle for skill and wit with words. 
Likewise, the sonnets had been summa
rized by three lines on a note card, 
which was circulated through the audi
ence after intermission.
The casts best moments came during
pletely condensed three second version, 
and the final backwards version pro
vided the grand finale for the evening, 
with the immortal line, Melt would 
flesh solid too too this that, O. 
Although The Compleat Works may 
not be the definitive scholarly summary 
of Shakespeares works, it was able to 
provide an evening of good, silly fun. 
Even those with little exposure to 
Shakespeare could still appreciate the 
majority of the humor, very little of which 
was based on obscure references. And 
where else could one find an interpret 
tive chicken dance based on Troilus. 
and Cressida?Woven fragments of paper shed light on artists life
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Acting Diversions EditorIWhile Rumplestiltskin may be 
disappointed by the fact that art
ist Margaret Wagner has not spun 
her shredded journals, past art
work, mail, and family photoj' graphs into gold, others will be 
impressed by her new exhibit 
which evolved from her collection 
of paper fragments.
Weaving together thousands

piece, a photograph of a house, 
is not woven. However, like 
its surroundings, it has 
been shredded.
The house has been woven, 
and it has been unwoven, said 
Wagner. Its in the process right 
now. Ive been trying to decide 
whether or not to buy a house, so 
it has potential. But for now, its 
something that is still waiting to
bewoven. And perhaps one day; 
it will be.
Making and Unmaking was 
originally shown in 1996, when 
Wagner wove her two figurative 
pieces for the first time. Since its 
beginning, the exhibit has trav-; 
eled to New York City, Buffalo; 
and Boston, and the weaving 
has continued.
And so, even though the install 
lation presents a finished prod-j 
uct with near-perfect craftsman-; 
ship and highly involved compo-i 
sition, one cannot help but pon; 
der other possibilities as thou
sands of entangled paper frag^ 
ments rest on the floor.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  8 February 1999Lll
By ASEEM GUPTA
Tartan Acting Webmaster 
& SRINIVAS PULLELA
,Tartan Staffwriter
Anne Sophie Mtters enthral
ling performance of Brahmss Vio
lin Concerto in D brought the 
audience to its feet for a standing 
ovation at last Friday nights 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
(PSO) concert. Mtter handled 
the technical challenges of the 
piece effortlessly, allowing her to 
devote much of her attention to a 
masterful delivery of Brahmss 
monumental work.
The Allegro non-Troppo move
ment opened with a passionate 
statement of the first theme. 
Despite the thick orchestration 
of the opening measures, the or
chestra played with clarity and 
precision. The soloists dramatic 
entrance, peppered with succes
sive double-stops, left the audi
ence short of breath and full of 
anticipation for what was to come.
While Mtter handled the solo 
segment of the piece with mas
tery, Mariss Jansons was hard at 
work to ensure that the orchestra 
could hold its own. Jansonss 
love for a full orchestral sound 
was apparent in the several mea
sures leading up to the culmina
tion of the movement. Mtter 
managed the many technical 
demands of the cadenza with
precision and boldness. She 
showed remarkable control and 
fullness of tone even while 
playing the most delicate pianis
simo passages.
In marked contrast to the first 
movement, the Adagio movement 
presented Jansons and Mtter 
with an entirely new set of musi
cal challenges. Jansons was 
forced to abandon his affinity to
wards dramatic orchestral sound
in favor of a more subdued lyri
cism. Mtter responded with a 
splendid and passionate tone that 
few violinists are capable 
of matching.
The lively Allegro Giocoso 
movement opened with an ani
mated violin solo accompanied 
by the strings. Jansonss tendency 
towards dramatic phrasing 
worked in his favor, as it high
lighted the energetic impulse of 
the principle theme. The rondo 
theme is prevalent throughout 
the final movement and is pre
sented at the end of the move
ment in a march-like variation. 
Followed by a triumphant esca
lation, Jansons concluded the con
certo expertly.
Upon conclusion of the concerto, 
Mtter was met with an enthusi
astic response from the audience. 
The crowd was still on its 
feet after the fourth curtain call, 
and Mtter raised her violin, 
signifying the start of an encore.
Mtter chose to play Sarabande 
from J.S. Bachs second violin 
Partita in D major. Although the 
piece was restrained in compari
son to the Brahms concerto, 
Mtter played with just as much 
expression. She displayed a range 
of expression in tone, as well as a 
balance between the voices in the 
occasional polyphonic texture of 
Bachs writing. The audience gave 
Mtter her second standing ova
tion of the night after she con
cluded her encore.
The evenings program marked 
a departure from the standard 
overture-concerto-symphony 
form by switching the order in 
which the symphony and concerto 
were played.
The PSOs overture was Rich
ard Strausss Till EulenspiegeVs 
Lustige Streiche which was first 
performed in 1895, Till
Eulenspiegel served as a delight
ful opening piece to the evening.
Strauss based his comic tone 
poem upon the legend of its name
sake prankster. Eulenspiegel 
was alleged to have lived during 
the 14th century and some doubt 
remains as to whether he was 
simply a mythic character or an 
actual figure who tormented the 
rich and powerful.
Originally Strauss intended to 
write a full opera but soon real
ized that such an endeavor would 
not succeed. Instead he wrote his 
tone poem without any clear story 
line, and was later reluctant to 
provide one. The PSOs perfor
mance of the short piece was im
pressive, and, Jansonss ability
to tease out the comic elements of 
the piece was quite successful.
The piece put a smile on the 
faces of many audience members, 
and there were even a few giggles 
heard during one of the final sec
tions of the piece that represent 
Eulenspiegels death sentence.
Under Jansonss careful direc
tion, the PSO delivered a well 
rounded program that proved to 
be a success. Next week the PSO 
will feature soloist Yefim 
Bronfmans performance of 
Schumanns Concerto in A minor 
for Piano and Orchestra, op. 54, 
as well as works by Haydn, 
Wagner, and Bartok. The PSO 
has exceeded all expectations, and 
all are encouraged to attend.

Lolita
Can anyone tell me how Dolores, the real name of 
Nabokovs femme pre-adolescent, becomes Lolita? I 
just dont understand. Dolores is the name of a 
dumpy girl with glasses and an overbite. (Except, of 
course, for any Doloreses who might be reading 
this.) Lolita is, well, we all know what Lolita is. I 
wouldnt mention it except that, in Lolita, names 
are extremely important to their characters. In this 
version, Lolita is played with slightly understated 
sensuality by Dominique Swain. Jeremy Irons is 
the pedophile, uh, tragically obsessed Humbert 
Humbert. With a name like that how could he be 
anything but? Melanie Griffith plays Lolitas mother, 
Charlotte Haze, who refuses to see Humberts fixa
tion on her daughter. She is also on a massive 
amount of drugs. Frank Langella plays Clare 
Quilty, the playwright of many names and there
fore many identities.

Your Friends and Neighbors
Someone must have hurt Neil LaBute as a child. 
Badly. How else can one explain his obsession with 
the dark, selfish, and cruel side of human nature? 
His first film, In The Company of Men, was about 
the horrible game that two men played to win a deaf 
womans heart as part of a bet. In that film, you 
could at least feel pity for the woman, but this time, 
LaBute kicks it up a notch. There is no one to side 
with in this movie. Most of the characters are 
verbally abusive with one another, and everyone 
cheats on everyone else. But sex is never just sex; 
its power. There are way too many sexual permu
tations to list.
Of course these troubles cause each of the part
ners to stray, sometimes with the other couples and 
sometimes with the two singles  Cary, the human 
incarnation of all things evil, and Cheri, the requi
site lesbian.

Great Expectations
CMU dropout Ethan Hawke stars in this film 
adaptation of the Dickens classic. The names and 
places have changed but the basic idea is the same. 
Hawke plays Finn, formerly Pip, a man who never 
gets over his childhood sweetheart, Estella, played 
in adulthood by a very cold and elegant Gwyneth 
Paltrow. Estellas aunt is Ms. Dismoor, formerly 
Miss Havisham, played by a heavily made-up Anne 
Bancroft. After being left on her wedding day many 
years ago, Ms. Dismoor has taught Estella never to 
let herself fall in love because it can only lead to 
pain. What a happy pre-Valentines day film!

Valentines Day Surprise
I tried to find out what the movie was, I really did. 
But AB is keeping this one pretty tightly under 
wraps. The best that I could get is that its either 
going to be some sort of porno or mushy eighties 
movie. So, basically AB has to decide who they want 
to please this Valentines day: all the single guys or 
all of the single girls. So, be it porno or Pretty in 
Pink, someone is definitely going to be surprised.

Sam Prekop
Sam Prekop 
Thrill Jockey
Easy listening for the jaded? 
Thats one accurate description 
of Sam Prekops self-titled solo 
album. The music he produces on 
the album combines the placid, 
contemplative jazziness of easy 
listening music with an edge of 
complexity and lyrics that some
times drift towards the cynical. 
Granted, this is similar to the 
music that his band, The Sea and
Cake, plays; however, this is an 
effective production.
Along with Prekop, fellow Sea 
and Cake member Archer Prewitt 
appears in a major role on this 
album, with bandmate John 
McEntire appearing intermit
tently. Three-fifths of the band 
appearing on this album results 
in an effort that sounds like The 
Sea and Cake, but in their argu
ably better moments.
Much of the album is reminis
cent of the bands 1995 album 
The Biz. Tracks such as Show
rooms and The Shadow are
standard Sea and Cake fare, with 
smooth vocals and instruments 
that calm while attacking the 
Muzak of modem easy listening. 
Dont Bother includes beauti
ful violin and viola from Julie 
Pomerleau, while On Such Fa
vors focuses on subtle organ and 
muted percussion.
There are two pieces on the 
album that have significant elec
tronics. Faces and People is 
reminiscent of newer material, 
with the beeps and drum ma
chine clatter of the Tiuo Gentle
men EP. The track is interesting
but effectively unfulfilling. So - 
Shy, on the other hand, begins   
with warped electronic trickeryand drifts into ambient acoustic - 
jazz and is the high point ofthe album.
The derivative nature of the ; 
album enhances rather than de; 
tracts; instead of doing precisely 
what his band did, Prekop takes 
The Sea and Cake and adds new 
and different flavors. Even if you 
are not familiar withThe Sea 
and Cake, this disc is definitely 
worth owning.
 ROB JEFFERSONLackluster film scams audience
Outfit. Exactly what they do is never ; 
stated, yet they control an entire hotel. 
Helgeland, who also co-wrote the screen
play, stretches these thin ideas into a fea
ture with the help of plot devices. For 
example, the villain is killed only when 
appropriate, guns are not loaded at key 
times, and a cast of stock characters pep
per the action.
These touches could be overlooked if the 
film had an emotional center. However, 
since the outcome is clear from the begin
ning, the paint-by-numbers script grates . 
on the nerves. Are we supposed to take 
dialogue such as These guys arent going 
to stop until they kill us, are they? seri: 
ously? I certainly hope not. In place 
of witty conversation are platitudes, 
jokes centered around a 
dominatrix, and the bumbling es
capades of two crooked cops.
The movie doesnt do anything 
else to stir up interest, either. Ex
cept for one shot of a prone bulletriddled Gibson, the film steers away 
from interesting visuals after the 
teasing of the opening scene. In 
most places the acting is service
able. David Paymer has flashes of 
life as a drug-dealing taxi dis
patcher, but settles into his stereo
typed role as the narrative contin
ues. On the other end of the scale is 
Henry, who turns in a wooden per
formance as Val. Although his role 
is narrowly defined, his poor acting 
job cant be blamed on the script 
since everyone else managed un
der the same conditions.
If you have a desire to see a string 
of clichs, run out and see Payback. 
Otherwise, read a book. Your brain 
Mel Gibson (I) and Gregg Henry (r) star in the new motion picture, Payback. will thank you later.
BY DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
What do you get when you cross sadists, a 
mysterious corporation, Mel Gibson, and ev
ery expedient plot device in a screenwriters 
arsenal? Paramount Pictures had an ardent 
desire to find out, so it developed Payback. 
Now that I have seen the film, Im convinced 
this sub-par movie is Paramounts payback in 
return for some serious offense I committed 
against the corporation.
Payback opens with a doctor drinking a 
glass of scotch. Director Brian Helgeland cuts 
to a close-up of the doctors face and moves 
down to his hands slipping on surgical gloves.
Finally the camera shows the sterilization of 
a pair of scissors in another scotch glass.
Mel Gibsons first voice-over soon follows - 
unnaturally deep and straight out of a bad 
film noir detective tale. Once he has finished, 
the movie is over; all that remains is an 
exercise in fitting as much cheesy dialogue 
into a script as possible.
The story focuses in on Porter (Gibson), 
whose partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) 
steals his money and shoots him. What Val 
doesnt know was that Porter wasnt dead. 
Now hes back to collect the money and take 
his revenge on Val. Porter must also deal 
with the syndicate which Val bought his way 
into with the stolen money known as The
Violinist receives standing ovations

Th omas Edison meefs Abraham Lincoin
Two geniuses in American history, Abraham Lincoln on February 
12, 1809 and Thomas Edison on February 11, 1847, were born 
this week. Edison was the most outstanding genius in the histo 
ry of technology. He earned patents for more than 1,000 inventions, including the incandescent electric lamp, the phono
graph, the carbon telephone transmitter, and the motion-picture 
projector. Meanwhile Lincoln, with his political genius, changed' 
our societys structure. What would we have done if ~the United 
States had split into two countries, one the United States and the 
other one the Confederate states? Thanks to Lincoln, we dont 
have to worry about that possibility. Where would we be if Edi
son had not invented the light bulb or the phonograph? I guess 
there would not be any monitors or any stereos, and we would
nt be even thinking about MP3*^. The birthdays of these geniuses 
are widely celebrated in two areas of the U.S. There is a week 
devoted to studying and understanding Lincoln and his politics in 
Springfield, Illinois, as well as a festival in honor of Edison in 
Fort Myers, Florida. The Edison Festival of Light started in 1938 
in celebration of Edisons lifetime achievements. The festival 
includes a Coronation Ball, a parade, a band concert, and memori
al services. When you think about how each manthas changed 
your life, you too would want to celebrate their birthdays.
Did you know that when Edi
son was born, Lincoln was 
moving to Washington D.C. 
to assume his seat in the 
House of Representatives?
