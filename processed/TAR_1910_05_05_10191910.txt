TECH LOSES TO GROVE CITY
The Carnegie Tech foot-ball team suffered its 
second defeat this season when Grove City College 
won from us last Saturday by the score of 160. 
The Plaid warriors put up a stiff fight but were 
outweighed and out-played by the seasoned aggre
gation of veterans whom they faced. The Grove 
City team composed almost entirely of old, experi
enced players, some of whom are in their fourth 
year of foot-ball, had a big advantage over the light, 
new Carnegie team and used every opportunity to 
further their lead.
The Tech backfield showed up well throughout 
the game, but the line proved weak, 
especially in the first half. In the second-half the 
entire team took a brace, but it was too late to re
trieve the losses suffered during the first part of the 
game.
While Grove City only made one substitution, 
Tech substituted with prodigal freedom. To this 
may be atributed the lack of team work and concen
trated play which characterized the work of our 
lads on one or two occasions.
Schmucker, who did not appear in the original 
line-up, played a splendid game for Tech. He made 
consistent gains with the ball passed accurately 
and made Carnegies only score by drop-kicking a 
goal from the 20-yard line in the third quarter. His 
punting was above the -average. Hatch, New 
brand, Dyer and Hull showed up well in the tack
ling department.
For Grove City, Marks, Acker and Boone carried 
the ball well while Lamb at center tore great gaps 
in Techs line.
A large crowd of students were in attendance at 
the game and the support given the team was a
credit to Carnegie rooters. During the intermis
sion a snake-dance was performed on the field and 
the rooting throughout the contest was a source of 
pleasure and satisfaction to every Tech man.
The game in detail:
Hatcher won the toss and Lamb kicked off to 
Mandeville on the 5-yard line, from whence he re
turned it to the 20-yard mark. Taylor gained 3 
yards around end, but on the next play the ball was 
fumbled, Hatcher recovering it for no gain. Hull 
then kicked to Marks, McCorkle downing the Grove 
City back on Techs 32-yard line. Marks made 7 
yards through center and Ketler fumbled the ball 
but recovered it on the 23-yard line. On the next 
play, Grover City fumbled again and Tech took the 
ball on the 23-yard line. Taylor went around right 
end for 5 yards and Hull made 4 yards around the 
other end. Taylor could not gain the necessary 
yard and our opponents took the ball. Ketler made 
23 yards on a delayed pass, going through right 
tackle. This was Grove Citys most effective play 
and one which proved a consistent ground-gainer. 
However, the next play ended disastrously, McCorkle 
recovering Boones fumble on Techs 3-yard line. 
Mandy made 3 yards through the center of the line 
and Hull went through right tackle for three more. 
Hun then punted over Kiskaddons head to the 
Grove City 35-yard line, Dyer downing the man in his 
tracks. Boone made 3 yards, but Grove City re
ceived a 10-yard penalty, which again set them back. 
Marks then kicked to Hull at the center of the field. 
He signaled for a fair catch, but was tackled, the 
penalty placing the ball on the 40-yard line. Taylor 
lost 5 yards at tackle and on the next down failed 
to gain. On a fake kick play, Hatcher made 14

yards only, but Tech lost possession of the ball. 
Marks made 9 yards around his right end and Kiskaddon went 30 yards around the other end, Hull 
tackling him on Techs 35-yard line. Ketler, on a 
delayed pass, went through tackle to the 24-yard 
line, Blair finally downing him. From there Marks 
went through the line to the 3-yard line, and time 
was called for the end of the quarter.
The second quarter began with the ball in Grove 
Citys possession on Techs 3-yard line. Engstrom 
went to center in Blairs place, he having hurt his 
shoulder and Schmucker took Mandevilles place 
at full-back. Marks then went through center be
hind Lamb for a touchdown. Lamb kicked goal. 
Score: Grove City 6, Tech 0.
Hull kicked off to Acher on the 10-yard line and 
he advanced it 5 yards before Dyer stopped him. 
Grove City then fumbled, Schmucker recovering the 
ball on the 20-yard line. Hull gained 3 yards in two 
tries and then attempted to drop-kick a field goal, 
the ball going wide of the posts. However, the ref
eree saw Lamb offside and brought the ball back, 
penalizing Grove City 5 yards, giving the ball and 
first down to Tech on the 10-yard line. Hatcher 
lost three yards trying to round Acher. Kesselman 
then went in for McCorkle. Hatcher lost 4 yards 
more and then on a fake kick ran to the 5-yard 
line. This was not far enough and the ball went 
to the Red and White. Kether took the ball from 
there to the 35-yard line, Hatcher getting the tackle. 
Turvis gained 3 yards and Marks made 6 more 
through guard. On the next play Grove City made
4 yards and then Marks carried the ball to Techs
25-yard line. Halton went in for Moorhead. Boone 
failed to gain at center and Ketler made 4 yards 
around the end. Marks failed to gain, the ball 
going to Tech on downs. Schmucker could not 
gain through Lamb and Hull kicked out of bounds 
at the 51-yard line. From there Acher carried the 
ball 17 yards after receiving a forward pass, Dyer 
tackling him. Marks went around Kesselman to the 
10-yard line, but Hull tackled Boone for an 8-yard 
loss. Boone went through tackle to the 5-yard line 
before Hatcher downed him and Marks went 
through behind Lamb to the 1-yard line. Critchlow 
then went in for Dyer. Ketler took the ball over 
and fumbled, but Harbison recovered. Lamb failed 
at goal. Hull then kicked off to Ketler on the 10- 
yard line and he went to the 25-yard line before he 
was stopped. A Grove City man was hurt and time 
was taken out. Marks made a forward pass to 
Acher, who carried the ball 35 yards, only to be 
called back, as play had not been called. Marks 
then made 5 yards through center and time was up. 
Score: Grove City 11Tech 0.
When the men lined up for the second half, it was 
discovered that the coaches had made several sub
stitutions. Hatcher was at end in Dyers place, 
Blanchard going to quarter. Newbrand was in 
Hulls position at half. Lamb kicked to Schmucker 
and he ran it to the 30-yard line. Taylor lost 2
yards and Blanchard 5 more. Schmucker kicked 
over Kiskaddons head and Hatcher recovered the 
ball on Grove Citys 10-yard line. Newbrand could 
not gain and Taylor made 5 yards around tackle. 
Schmucker then went back and drop-kicked the ball 
between the cross-bars from the 20-yard line, giving 
Tech 3 points. Lamb, from the 25-yard line, punted 
out 40 yards to chmucker, who returned it 10 yards. 
Newbrand and Taylor could only gain one yard and 
Schmucker lost 6 on an attempted forward pass. 
This gave the ball to Grove City at the center of 
the field. Turvis gained 10 yards on a forward pass 
and Ketler made 4 more around end. A delayed 
pass was then worked, Ketler carrying the ball to 
the j.0-yard line. Boone failed to gain but Kiskaddon carried the ball over for the third touch down. 
Lamb failed to kick goal. Score: Grove City 16 
Tech 3.
Schmucker kicked off to Marks, who advanced 
it to the 16-yard line. Boone made 6 yards in two 
tries, Taylor and Schmucker making good tackles. 
Marks then kicked to Blanchard at the center of the 
field. 'Here Kesselman hurt his knee, but continued 
in the game. Schmucker failed to gain, but Taylor 
slipped around tackle for 4 yards. Blanchard could 
not gain the necessary distance on a fake kick and 
the ball went to Grove City on the 52-yard line. 
Ensbigler and Boone gained but 2 yards and Marks 
kicked to Blanchard on Techs 40-yard line. Taylor 
gained a yard, and Schmucker made a beautiful for
ward pass to Hatcher, Red going to Grove Citys 
45-yard line. On the next play Schmucker again 
passed the ball, this time to Blanchard. He fum
bled the ball but Hatcher recovered it on Grove 
Citys 34-yard line. The next play was also a for
ward pass, but a Grove City man intercepted it. 
'1 he quarter ended with the ball in their possession 
on the 25-yard line.
Boone opened the next quarter by gaining 8 yards. 
On the next play Hatton tackled Ketler for a 10- 
yard loss. Marks kicked to Hatcher on Techs 40-

ard gained the same distance at center. Schmucker 
kicked to Boone on the 40-yard line. He advanced 
it to Techs 51-yard line. Marks went around Kess
elman to the 25-yard line. Hatcher was hurt in 
tackling him and Dyer took his place at end. Trainer 
Johnson came on the field with a water bucket to 
revive Hatcher and the referee penalized Tech 15 
yards for having an extra man on the field. This 
gave the ball to Grove City on the 10-yard line with 
three chances to gain the distance. Here our boys 
made a magnificent stand and Marks and Ketler 
could only advance the ball 3 yards. Tech took 
possession of the ball. Schmucker kicked to Marks 
on the 25-yard line, Kesselman nailing him before 
he took a step. A forward pass failed but Grove

Smoking in front of the building and in the halls 
is an evil which is becoming worse every day. Most 
of the men know, or should know, that the practice 
is carried on directly in opposition to the wishes of 
the faculty. This should not be. Every man should 
do his part in keeping order. Smoke in the clubroom provided for that purpose. Then there can 
be no possible cause for complaint. The first-year 
men have been more inclined to smoke where they 
shouldnt than the second-year men. This may be 
due in some degree to their newness and ignorance 
of Tech customs. At anyrate, let all of us do our 
best to stamp out the disorder before the faculty 
feels compelled to take a hand. A word to the wise 
is enough.

Carnegie Technical Schools
The New Gym.
Next Saturday will see the opening of the new 
gymnasium. From a view-point of student health 
and physical welfare, the building of the gym has 
been the greatest improvement made in and about 
the Schools for several years. The work which 
must be done by a student in Carnegie Tech is such 
that only downright hard work and perseverance 
will bring success. This state of things is certain 
to result in a low plane of health among the stu
dents unless something can be done to counteract 
the effect of the long hours and deep concentration 
of the class-room. With this end in view the De
partment of Health, under the able direction of Mr. 
McCulloch, has been created and the new gymna
sium constructed. Hereafter the weary student, 
tired and worried by his long journeys into the 
realms of Mathematics, Physics and Economics, can 
throw his cares to the winds and gain renewed vigor 
and strength by a sharp game of basket-ball or an 
hour or two spent in exercise on the mat.
The Physical Director does not intend to see any
one deprived of his chance to improve himself phys
ically. All the new men will receive a physical ex
amination and will be compelled to show improve
ment both in physical development and general 
health under penalty of being refused credits in 
their studies.
The new building will make basket-ball a paying 
Varsity sport at Tech and there is every prospect 
that the Plaid will have an aggressive, winning team 
oh the floor this Winter. The Schools have never 
been wanting in good basket-ball material. The
lack of a place to practice has always been a big 
handicap. As this will be overcome under the new 
conditions, Tech may be cxpected to put forth an 
aggregation of tossers which will be a credit to the 
institution.
The floor of the new building is large and airy. 
If arrangements can be made, it will prove a de
lightful place to hold small school dances and will 
probably be greatly in demand in the near future.
In these and a great many other ways, the gym 
will prove a boone to all Techites and before many 
months have passed we will all be wondering how 
we ever got along without it.
OPENING OF THE GYMNASIUM.
The following invitation has been issued to every 
member of the faculty, sudent and alumnus of the 
Carnegie Technical Schools:
Director and Mrs. Hamerschlag 
Cordially Invite You to the Opening of the 
ATHLETIC FIELD HOUSE 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools 
Woodlawn Avenue, near Forbes Street 
Saturday, October Twenty-second 
Nineteen Hundred and Ten 
From One to Three OClock
The reception to be held next Saturday will in
augurate the completion of the new gymnasium. 
The building has been under course of construction 
since last June, is built of reinforced concrete and 
is in every way a creditable adjunct to the Schools. 
The Director is particularly anxious to meet all of 
the new men of the Day and Night Schools, as this 
is the first opportunity which he has had to get per
sonally in touch with them. The reception will be 
of an informal, nature and every man and woman 
in Carnegie Tech should be on board. As the time 
set is from one to three, everyone will have an op
portunity to afterwards attend the foot-ball game 
between Carnegie and Geneva College. Come around 
and help make this an affair to be remembered.
GLEE AND MANDOLIN CLUBS.
At the meeting of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs 
on Sunday afternoon, the hours for rehearsals were 
definitely decided.upon. The Glee Club rehearsals 
will be held on Tuesday and Thursday afternoon at
5 oclock. The Mandolin Club rehearsals will be 
held on Monday and Friday afternoon at 5 oclock. 
The night men are to come around just as soon after
5 oclock as possible.
Both the Glee and Mandolin Clubs have been 
asked to be present at the Dedication Smoker at 
the new Gymnasium on Saturday, October 26, 1910, 
at 8 oclock.
A list of last years men, eligible for Carnegie 
Musical Club insignia, will appear in the next weeks

RECEPTION TO THE PLEBES.
The annual reception to the Plebes was held at 
school on Friday afternoon, October 14th, from 
three until five oclock. The faculty, assisted by 
the Seniors and Juniors, received the Plebes in the 
Faculty parlors.
The preparations for the affair were well thought 
out by Mrs. Gibbs and Miss Bradt. Decorations of 
greens brought in by the Juniors, and the beautiful 
center-piece of pink and lavendar cosmas on the 
serving table made a charming picture, but chief of 
the beauties of the occasion were the lovely girls 
who comprise the incoming class.
The receiving line was made up of Director and 
Mrs. Hamerschlag, Dean West, Miss Nolen, Senior 
Class president, and Miss Cushwa, Junior president, 
Miss Pendleton, Plebe chairman, presenting the 
girls of her class.
A feature that gave great pleasure to all present 
was the musical program, after which refreshments 
were served by the Senior girls in true Household 
Arts style. A very informal atmosphere prevailed 
during the reception. The upper class girls made 
good use of the opportunity to become acquainted 
with the Plebes. Altogether it was a most enjoy
able affair.

The Plebe class of M. M. C. S. held a meeting at 
three oclock, October 12. The meeting was pre
sided over by Miss Pendleton, the class chairman. 
The report of the color committee was called for. 
After hearing the report, the class voted upon the 
colors and Gold and drown were chosen by a large 
majority. The members of this committee were 
Miss Ash, Miss Layman, and Miss Broadhead.
it was decided that each Plebe wear a knot of the 
colors at the reception on Friday atternoon. These 
Knots were made by tne color committee.
The meeting adjourned.
TENNIS TOURNAMENT.
Physical Director McCulloch has recently an
nounced that two tennis tournaments will be held 
at Carnegie Tech this year, one to take place at 
once and one to come in the spring. The latter will 
be a handicap tournament and will be the first one 
of its kind to be held at Tech. A very interesting 
series of games may be expected in this meet, as 
every one will have an equal chance to win. The 
one now going on will be a great aid to Mr. McCul
loch in determining the handicaps to be given the 
different players in the spring games.
Techs tennis team for the coming year should be 
the best in her history. Last year, with a green 
team, we made an excellent showing at the inter
collegiate tournament held by Pitt. This year Duff, 
Flood and Woods of last years team are back and 
should be better than ever. Several new men with 
good records have entered school and many of the 
unsuccessful candidates of last spring have im
proved greatly during the summer.
The fight for places on the team will be fast and 
hot. The inter-collegiates will be held at Geneva 
this year, and at least four men will be sent there 
for the three days. The tennis men are making an 
effort to secure recognition in the form of a letter 
or other insignia from the Athletic Association, but 
whether or not they will be successful is a matter 
of conjecture.

Professor Trinks says that tardiness would be 
diminished by charging students ten cents and pro

PLEBE CLASS.
The Plebe Class of the School of Applied Science 
held a meeting last week, in which the following 
permanent class officers were elected 'for the first 
semester:
PresidentA. E. Johns. z
Vice PresidentA. A. Schneider.
SecretaryL. R. Maddison.
TreasurerA. M. McKusich.
Tartan RepresentativeH. J. Kennedy.
After discussing plans for the ensuing year, the 
meeting was adjourned.
The Plebe foot-ball team has been organized and 
practice has been started. Quite a bunch of likelylooking candidates have reported and Manager 
Brine expects to have a first-class team back 01 him 
in very little time.
Very few men in the Plebe Class have subscribed 
for the Tartan. This shows a lamentable lack of 
school-spirit upon the part of the new men. The 
Tartan is published in your interest as well as that: 
of the rest of the school. It is up to you to offer 
your support. Subscribe now and know what is 
happening.
TRACK AND CROSS-COUNTRY TEAMS.
As soon as the new gymnasium is opened, Phys
ical Director McCulloch will call out candidates for 
the track and cross-country teams. For a while he 
will spend the greater part of his time with the lat
ter, as he expects to enter, a number of men in the 
big run to be held, by the Pittsburg Athletic Asso
ciation on Thanksgiving morning. He has already 
taken steps toward securing permission from the 
Park Commissioners to lay out a five-mile practice 
course in Schenley Park. If this can be done, Tech 
men will have the best training facilities ever afford
ed a Carnegie team.

The usual inertia which comes with the opening 
of school is over and the students are back in the 
grind again with all the enthusiam that comes with 
the love of ones work.
All the students of last year are back with but 
few exceptions. Many new ones have been added, 
making a total enrollment which is unprecedented.
An Applied Design School foot-ball team is being 
organized and promises to make good. The school 
is well represented on the Varsity this year. Sure
ly the school will be able to furnish a team of their 
own which will be capable of doing things.
AN IMPROVEMENT.
The habitues of Mechanical Hall are pleased over 
the installation of automatic announcers. All 
classes are now regulated by the clanging of the 
bell. Students and professors are alike benefited. 
From now on there will be no straggling of students 
into class for ten minutes after the scheduled time 
for starting. On the other hand, men will not be 
kept in the class-room over-time due to the fact that 
the instructor forgot to look at his watch. Thus 
does modern genius come to the rescue of the seeker 
after knowledge.

Plans for the coming year were discussed and it 
was decided that the Club take an active part in 
school activities as it has done in the past. Several 
dances will be given during the year and open meet
ings will be given to members of the School of Ap
plied Design. The Club anticipates a very success
ful year.
FOOT-BALL BENEFIT.
A smoker and entertainment will be given in the 
gymnasium next Saturday, Oct. 22, at 8 P. M. The 
proceeds of the affair will go toward providing a 
training-table for the foot-ball team, something of 
which they are sadly in need. Owing to the late 
hour at which practice must be held every evening, 
it has become vitally necessary to provide the even
ing meal, at least, for the team. This costs money, 
and as the management is running upon a rockbottom allowance from the Athletic Association, the 
money must be raised by, some especial method. 
Hence the smoker.
During the evening the Tech Glee and Mandolin 
Club will be in attendance, while a couple of pro
fessional entertainers have been engaged to amuse 
those present. Athletic contests are being arranged 
and an enjoyable evening is assured all those who 
attend. An admission of 25 cents will be charged.
Now is the time to help the team. Come out and 
give them your support. Get in the band-wagon 
and boost. Show your Tech spirit.
MHO CLUB MEETS.
The first monthly meeting of the Mho Club was 
held on Wednesday evening, December 12, in room
