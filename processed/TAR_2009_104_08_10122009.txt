Lambda Sigma builds Cardboard City
Jesse Kummer/Photo Staff
Pictured above are the cardboard boxes that participants slept in overnight on the CFA lawn. A one night 
experience on the lawn was supposed to represent a lifetime of homelessness on the streets of Pittsburgh.
ALEXANDRA RIEDL
Assistant News Editor
Last week, an event titled 
Cardboard City took place on 
th Cut to raise awareness about 
homelessness in Pittsburgh.
Every night, over 1000 people 
in Allegheny County find them
selves without a bed to sleep in, 
according to a site created by 
the Carnegie Mellon Student 
Government Executive Branch. 
Homelessness is a problem both 
in Allegheny County and nation
wide, with increasing numbers 
of individuals being put on the 
street due to job losses and fore
closures.
Hosted by Carnegie Mellons 
Lambda Sigma Honor Society, 
the event was open to the cam
pus community, both individuals 
and organizations, to help raise 
awareness. A free event, stu
dents were able to spend a night 
in a cardboard box to experience 
what it feels like to be homeless.
I thought it was a good way to 
raise awareness about issues that 
CMU students are usually insu
lated from, said Anna Goddard, 
a senior philosophy major and 
resident assistant.
According to the site, even if 
students are aware of issues such 
as homelessness, many do not 
know how to help. The informa
tion on the site made helping out 
very easy and manageable for 
students.
Another member of Lambda 
Sigma and a participant in the 
sleepover shared why this was 
an important event to hold: It is 
raising awareness [of] homeless
ness and how it still is an issue to
day. Most people overlook or are 
not aware of the fact that there 
still are a lot of homeless out on 
the streets of Pittsburgh, close to 
our campus, said Christopher 
DiAndreth, a sophomore chemi
cal engineering major.
Student Government meant 
for the event to be informative 
and humbling, reminding stu
dents that while they are busy 
and consumed with schoolwork 
and extracurricular activities, 
there are many other people out 
there much less fortunate than 
they are.
The students were given break
fast the next morning, but were 
asked to leave laptops at home. 
Instead they brought sleeping 
bags, blankets, tarps, and other 
basic items that help in spending 
a night outdoors, though these 
are things that the homeless 
likely do not have.
Some students who could only 
spend a few hours at Cardboard 
City still supported the event by 
giving monetary donations that 
were directly given to a home
less shelter. To raise money, they 
raffled off items from local busi
nesses and donated all proceeds 
from the raffle to Bethlehem Ha
ven.
I think its a great idea in that 
everyone here on campus can get 
involved easily to help out and 
promote awareness and have fun 
doing so. For those who do sleep 
outside all night, it will be a re
minder of how lucky we are to 
have a room, a bed, etc. every
thing that gets overlooked in our 
daily lives, DiAndreth said.
Other Cardboard Cities have 
been constructed to raise aware
ness about the homeless in places 
like Chicago, Illinois, and Mobile, 
Alabama, where the project was 
founded. The title Cardboard 
City comes from the name of an 
area of cardboard boxes near 
Waterloo Station in London, Eng
land, in which homeless people 
lived from 1983 to 1998.

volved in helping this cause, con

reCAPTCHA creation

Pictured above is an example of what a reCAPTCHA looks like. Users must 
type in the correct words in order to continue their webbrowsing.
JENNIFER THARP
Junior Staffwriter
On Sept. 16, Google an
nounced that it had acquired 
reCAPTCHA, a project first cre
ated by Carnegie Mellon com
puter science professor Luis von 
Ahn. Most would recognize the 
program as those distorted lines 
of text that one must type in to 
create online accounts and much 
more; they originate from a pro
gram called reCAPTCHA that 
is able to distinguish between a 
human and an automated user.
The first CAPTCHA, created 
by von Ahn and his Ph.D. ad
viser and Carnegie Mellon pro
fessor Manuel Blum, produced 
a randomly generated series 
of characters that a user had to 
type before accessing a web page 
or other online site to prevent 
spam, among other uses.
The current reCAPTCHA has 
an expanded purpose that the 
original did not: that of helping 
preserve the worlds pre-digital 
era books for generations to 
come.
At some point, we realized 
that about 200 million of these 
CAPTCHAs were typed everyday 
by people around the world, and 
the idea for reCAPTCHA came 
from trying to make good use of 
the time spent typing them. Two 
hundred million times a day is 
equivalent to [about] 500,000 
hours every day, said von Ahn, 
who wanted to harness this hu
man effort for the useful project 
of digitizing old books and news
papers.
The current method used to 
scan old texts is called OCR, or 
optical character recognition. A 
page is scanned into a computer 
as a digital image, and then OCR 
attempts to decipher the words, 
but it is not always right. That 
program is not very accurate 
for very old books or newspa
pers because the ink has faded, 
von Ahn said. That is where re
CAPTCHA begins to solve the 
dilemma.
Words that could not be ac
curately identified by OCR are 
presented to a user along with 
a correct control word. If the 
user types the control word cor
rectly, most of the time the user 
typed the unknown word cor
rectly also. As may be familiar
to users, the words often look 
distorted, as the reCAPTCHA 
program takes the image from 
the text, distorts the image in 
various ways, and then presents 
it to the viewer.
Our goal with accuracy is to 
produce a digital file that is bet
ter than a professional human 
transcriber.... To achieve this, 
we need to combine the output 
of OCR software with the hu
man answers from reCAPTCHA 
and decide, for each word, what 
the correct spelling of the word 
should be, said Colin McMillen, 
a full-time programmer for re
CAPTCHA.
To date, this process has digi
tized copies of The New York 
Times from its 150-year old 
archives, as referenced on the 
companys website, and has 
maintained high levels of pre
cision. So far weve done very 
well on this front  even for 
very old and challenging docu
ments, we get over 99 percent of 
words completely correct, Mc
Millen said.
The use of reCAPTCHA is 
spreading, chiefly as a result of 
its effective deterrence of spam, 
but also because it cannot be 
read by algorithms that worked 
on the original CAPTCHA, and 
because it has been beneficial 
and productive in digitizing the 
worlds literature.
A reCAPTCHA also takes ap
proximately the same time to 
solve as a typical CAPTCHA, 
so the benefits are real. Over 
100,000 websites, according 
to a United Kingdom telegraph 
source, are known to use it, and 
individual users can also down
load an HTML code from the 
companys website to protect 
their e-mail addresses.
In just one year, over 1.2 bil
lion reCAPTCHAs were deci
phered worldwide.
Where Google will take the 
ingenious program remains to 
be seen. This is not the first time 
that Google has worked with 
projects that began at Carnegie 
Mellon. In 2006, the company 
also licensed the ESP game de
veloped by von Ahn that allows 
for images to be labeled through 
online games. Its current name 
is the Google Image Labeler. Von

The campus community has 
watched as Pittsburghs typical 
fall showers have delayed the 
progress of the reconstruction 
on Carnegie Mellons iconic art 
structure. Walking to the Sky 
was created by Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus Jonathan Borofsky, who 
earned his BFA in 1964.
The piece that has resided on 
the Cut since May 2006 is actu
ally a copy of Borofskys Walking 
to the Sky, the first incarnation of 
which appeared in Rockefeller 
Center in New York City in 2004.
It was moved to Dallass Nasher 
Sculpture Center in 2005, where 
photos of it were taken for Borof
skys website. In 2008, another 
copy was installed in front of 
the Kiturami Homsys Company 
building in Seoul, South Korea, 
according to The Korea Times.
In an interview conducted by 
Carnegie Mellon Today in Decem
ber 2006, Borofsky revealed that 
the first version was actually just 
one man walking upward, which 
he created for a 1991 exhibition 
in Kassel, Germany. At the time, 
he said, I thought of the figure as 
pretty much representing myself, 
but also all of humanity.
After creating a second version 
with one woman, he thought that 
the next version should include 
many people walking up toward 
the sky. When he was asked to 
craft a temporary sculpture in 
Rockefeller Center, he took the 
opportunity to create this work.
When a sculpture like mine 
ends up at a particular public 
site, such as this one here at Car
negie Mellon, Borofsky said in 
the same interview, it is not my 
energy alone that has made this 
happen.... There have been many 
serious, knowledgeable, and

Relay for Life
Gesling Stadium hosted the Relay for Life fundraiser created by the American Cancer 
Society. Students camped out on the field in tents and sleeping bags as their team members 
walked, ran, and jogged around the track from 7 p.m. Saturday night until 7 a.m. Sunday 
morning. Little paper bags served as lanterns, each with a message written on it from a par
ticipant in the relay.
This past weekend, President Obama gave a speech to the Human Rights 
Campaign (HRC), the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender

While some critics viewed the speech as nothing more than recycled 
campaign promises, the HRC praised Obama and deemed him as their 
strongest ally in this fight. Here are some statistics about gay rights:

and the MLSAC itself. Projected 
on the wall behind the multilin
gual members was a slideshow 
of pictures taken from students 
recent trips abroad.
Along with the students  
who wore name tags with their 
specialized languages  numer
ous professors and faculty were 
scattered throughout the room, 
ready and willing to talk about 
their area of instruction.
And while there were dozens 
of students with experience in 
the eight languages offered (Ar
abic, Chinese, French, German, 
Italian, Japanese, Russian, and 
Spanish), several others attend
ing the social had no experience 
with languages at the school.
Susan Polansky, head of the 
Department of Modern Lan
guages, spoke of the benefits of 
learning a new language. Stu
dents who pursue the study of 
world languages and cultures 
are especially well-equipped for 
communicating, working, and 
networking in our increasingly 
interconnected world, Polansky 
said.
English may be considered 
the lingua franca in much of the 
working world, but the global 
corporate world ... is recognizing 
the importance of multilingual
proficiency and its economic re
turns.
Regarding chances to improve 
and enhance ones language 
skills, Polansky said, the more 
opportunity one has to do so, the 
better, including study abroad, 
study on campus, or a combina
tion.
While students may suspect 
a language class to be nothing 
more than an hour-long text
book lecture that can easily put 
students to sleep, MLSAC mem
bers assured their audience that 
language courses are far from 
this environment. More often 
than not, the textbook serves as 
just one of many resources used 
by professors to teach students 
not only about the language, but 
also its context within various 
cultures.
These new forms of communi
cation can offer endless informa
tion, if a student is willing. Lan
guages are what you make of it, 
said Nancy Brown, a sophomore 
majoring in ethics, history, and 
public policy. Though languages 
arent an official part of Browns 
academic career yet, shes consid
ering a minor in Spanish. Eventu
ally, shed like to spend a summer 
abroad in Granada, Spain.
Katie Dickson, a sophomore 
creative writing major, said that 
courses can be very demand
ing and often require a good 
deal of outside studying. Dick
son is taking classes toward the 
Foreign Language and Culture 
Certificate in Italian, as it is not 
offered as a minor at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Certificates are available in 
all languages of the modern lan
guage department, except Ara
bic. With her future knowledge 
of the language, working abroad 
in Italy is not completely out of 
the picture; she mentions that 
working for a publishing com
pany dealing with translations 
would be an optimal career for 
her.
Studying a language as a mi
nor can, in the words of Polansky, 
build a students interdisciplin
ary strengths in an exciting and 
creative way, as it enhances com
munication skills and cross-cultural awareness. She also adds 
that the studying and training 
in humanities contribute to en
hanced prospects for themselves 
and enriched fields of exchange 
and knowledge transfer for those 
with whom they interact.
Opinions on the event were 
positive, and several people were 
pleased with the large turnout. 
It was great to see interest in the 
activities of modern languages, 
Polansky said. I was delighted 
by the large attendance.
Borofskys vision in the works
File PhotoKristen Severson/Photo Editor
Jonothan Borofsky has more than one Walking to the Sky piece, but the one on Carnegie Mellons campus has 
been controversial since its implementation in May 2006. The piece has undergone many renovations recently.
$YH,fromAl
well-intentioned people whose 
specific job it is to focus on what 
is best for Carnegie Mellon, now 
and into the future.
Living in New York City, Jill 
Gansman, a trustee for Carn
egie Mellon and an alumna from 
1974, saw the sculpture in New 
York and commissioned Borof
sky to make another as a gift to 
Carnegie Mellon.
This is an inspiring work of 
art by one of our most acclaimed 
graduates, said Jared L. Cohon, 
Carnegie Mellons president, in a 
news flash on Carnegie Mellon Todays website. We are delighted 
that it has come to our campus.
After graduating from Carn
egie Mellon, Borofsky went on 
to earn a masters degree from 
Yales' School of Art and Archi
tecture. He then moved to New 
York, where he taught at the 
School of Visual Arts in New 
York until 1977, moving to the 
California Institute of the Arts 
until 1980.
He quickly became well-known 
in the arts world for his oversized 
sculptures, which became major 
features of many prominent Eu
ropean cities.
At the beginning of this semes
ter, the 100-foot stainless steel 
pole was anchored to the ground 
by cables attached to large ce
ment blocks. When the cables 
were removed later in the semes
ter, the wind flexed the pole so 
that the top swayed several feet 
back and forth.
Every version of Walking to the 
Sky is set at a 75-degree angle 
pointing east. The new steel pole
 which will be oriented in the 
same way  should be sturdier 
to prevent the bowing that wor
ried much of the campus in re
cent weeks.

Skin cancer could 
be hereditary
A study conducted by scien
tists at the University of Queen
sland in Brisbane Australia 
shows that skin cancer could 
be hereditary. Previously it was 
known that patients who had 
family members with skin can
cer were more likely to develop 
skin cancer themselves. How
ever, researchers were unsure 
of whether living in similar en
vironmental conditions caused 
skin cancer or whether it had a 
genetic link.
The recent study tested the 
presence of skin cancer in 
identical twins and in frater
nal twins. The results '".owed 
that in four out of the 27 tested 
pairs of identical twins, both 
the twins developed skin can
cer. On the other hand, only in 
three pairs out of 98 tested pairs 
of fraternal twins did both de
velop skin cancer. These results 
showed that skin cancer has a 
genetic link.

Researchers develop 
cocaine vaccine
Scientists at the Yale School 
of Medicine have created a vac
cine that could potentially help 
cocaine addicts. The vaccine 
causes the body to produce an
tibodies against cocaine.
Thus, when cocaine is in
gested by the addicts, the an
tibodies could destroy the 
cocaine and prevent it from 
ever reaching the brain. Thus 
cocaine consumption will not 
cause the addicts to become 
high. The researchers hope that 
if the users do not get high with 
cocaine, they will eventually 
stop taking it.
The researchers later con
ducted a study with the vaccine 
and found that 53 percent of 
the users who had achieved the 
desired antibody levels reduced 
their cocaine consumption by 
half.

Modified stem cells 
grow blood vessels
Researchers 1 at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology have added some 
extra genes to stem cells to 
enhance their ability to produce 
vascular tissue.
The stem cells were removed 
from the bone marrow of mice, 
and, using specially developed 
nanoparticles, the gene for the 
Vascular endothelial growth 
factor was inserted into the 
cells.
In mice, these cells allowed 
the development of new blood 
vessels near the site of an inju
ry. The scientists believe that 
more work needs to be done in 
this area before human trials 
can be conducted.

H1N1 harms more 
than seasonal flu
According to a recent study 
conducted on swine flu, onefourth of the hospitalized swine 
flu patients needed intensive 
care and 7 percent of the hos
pitalized patients died. These 
numbers are slightly higher 
than those of patients with just 
seasonal flu.
Another fact that makes swine 
flu different from seasonal flu is 
that nearly half of the hospital
ized patients are children and 
teenagers. The elderly are not as 
vulnerable to swine flu as they 
are to the seasonal flu. Only five 
percent of the patients admitted 
in hospitals because of swine flu 
were above the age of 65. This 
is very different from ordinary 
seasonal flu in which the elderly 
are the worst affected.

There was a flurry of excite
ment last week as the 2009 No
bel Prizes were announced. The 
awards in the science categories 
were given to researchers who 
made profound contributions 
to research in their respective 
fields. Presented here are small 
glimpses into the discoveries 
made by each of these research
ers.
The Nobel Prize in physics: 
Awarded to Charles K. Kao, 
Willard S. Boyle, and George 
E. Smith
The Nobel Prize in physics was 
awarded to three researchers for 
two different contributions. Ac
cording to the award statement, 
Charles K. Kao was awarded half 
the prize for groundbreaking 
achievements concerning the 
transmission of light in fibers 
for optical communication. Kao 
provided the basis for making 
usable optical fibers. Willard S. 
Boyle and George E. Smith share 
the other half for the invention 
of an imaging semiconductor cir
cuit  the CCD. This sensor is 
highly beneficial as it is present 
in most high quality cameras.
These two contributions origi
nate from vastly different ap
proaches to the scientific process 
and shed light on the various 
ways in which science can leave 
its mark on society.
Kaos contribution is one de
rived from years of meticulous 
work on an already well-established technology. Optical fibers 
had been around for decades 
when he made his breakthrough 
in the 1960s. Indeed, there was 
already a large market for them in
Regenerative medicine is 
an innovative and promising 
method for disease treatment 
that combines many different 
fields of study to facilitate our 
bodys natural ability to heal. 
The importance of regenerative 
medicine has prompted many in
stitutions to give grants to scien
tists and researchers to further 
the knowledge and applications 
of this breakthrough treatment. 
One such organization is the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH). 
Researchers at the University of 
Pittsburgh have received mon
etary awards to continue their 
work on regenerative medicine.
I The NIH chooses its recipients 
based on research that will ex
plore potentially groundbreak! ing and innovative advances for 
medicine.
Surgeries today are beset by 
tissue rejection, infection, and 
other complications. With re! generativeffmedicine, the cells
various short range applications. 
According to Carnegie Mellon 
physics professor Randall Feenstra, the fibers available had too 
many impurities and so the light 
would be attenuated (lose much 
of its energy). Kao determined 
after extensive research that this 
was due to the fact that the glass 
was not pure enough. This was 
the push that got the snowball 
of innovation rolling. After this, 
the obstacles in the way of useful 
optical cables fell steadily. These 
days, most of the information on 
earth travels by similar cables. 
The Nobel committee showed 
real insight in choosing Kao for 
this prestigious award.
In contrast with Kaos steady 
progress, the CCD  or chargedcoupled device  was invented 
in an hour-long brainstorming 
session at Bell Labs. Boyle and 
Smith wanted to come up with a 
better form of computer memory 
so that the funding to their de
partment would not be cut, but 
they were sidetracked by this 
idea.
According to Feenstra, a CCD 
is a silicon device that is light 
sensitive and records charge. All 
high quality professional cam
eras use CCDs to capture images 
because they have extremely 
high resolution (they can pick 
out fine details) and provide very 
accurate images. Indeed, they 
are responsible for the incredible 
pictures coming from the Hubble 
Space Telescope.
Another interesting fact is 
that the Nobel Prize oscillated 
between highly theoretical and 
practical results. Last year, it was 
awarded for a highly theoretical 
(and extremely important) dis
covery about the universe. This 
year is the other end of that os
cillation, given to three men who 
changed the way light impacts 
our lives.
of an individual can be used as a 
means of treatment, effectively 
eliminating rejection; some re
searchers even foresee tissue and 
organ growth without having to 
perform surgery.
Already, there are major fields 
of research within the study of 
regenerative medicine. It could 
help a person born with a dis
ease that prevents the proper 
functioning of a major organ by 
growing organs in a laboratory 
from the cells of the afflicted 
patient. Tissues, such as those 
found in heart valves, can also be 
engineered in hopes of repairing 
and maintaining tissue function 
with minimal surgery. Regenera
tive medicine works on a cellular 
level to replace cells lost from ac
cidents and other diseases and 
afflictions.
Ipsita Banerjee, professor of 
chemical and petroleum engi
neering at the University of Pitts
burgh, received the $2.2 million 
New Innovator Award for her 
work in the growth and differen
tiation of em^fryonic stem cells.
The Nobel Prize in medicine: 
Awarded to Elizabeth H. Black
burn, Carol W. Greider, and 
Jack W. Szostak
The 100th physiology or medi
cine Nobel Prize was awarded 
for the discovery of how chro
mosomes are protected by telom
eres and the enzyme telomerase. 
This is also the first time in his
tory that more than one woman 
has claimed a Nobel Prize in 
the sciences. Although many re
searchers had observed that the 
ends of chromosomes  telom
eres  served as a protection of 
sorts, no one was quite sure what 
exactly these telomeres were. 
All they knew was that they ba
sically acted like caps at the end 
of the genetic data. Using DNAsequencing methods, Blackburn 
showed that telomeres were sim
ply a collection of repeated DNA 
sequences.
She and Szostak then took an 
organism that lives in a pond, a 
tetrahymena, and discovered 
that the organisms telomeres 
protected it from yeast. Because 
yeast is evolutionarily very dif
ferent from the pond-dwelling 
organism, the two researchers 
concluded that the telomeres de
fensive behavior expands beyond 
that of just the tetrahymena, and 
is a biological feature of most 
other organisms as well.
Blackburn, along with Carol 
Greider, continued to do research 
and experiments that tried to un
derstand exactly how telomeres 
were made from one DNA repli
cation to the next. As stated in an 
article in USA Today, in 1984, on 
Christmas Day, the two women 
found evidence to show that an 
enzyme named telomerase is 
what adds the telomeres to the 
end of chromosomes.
This discovery served as a pos
sible solution to how extra DNA
One objective of her research is 
to come up with a treatment for 
diabetes through the study of 
pancreatic islet cells, which have 
an active role in the regulation 
of insulin. As regenerative medi
cine encompasses many fields 
of science, Banerjee is taking a 
mathematical approach in study
ing the differentiation of these 
cells and the genes involved in 
regulating differentiation. She 
said, The lab experiments will 
provide the dynamic trend on the 
process of differentiation, which 
will be used by the mathematical 
models to capture and predict the 
regulatory mechanisms control
ling the process. Banerjee hopes 
that her research will be applica
ble to the differentiation of other 
cells. The end product of my re
search will be a rigorous mecha
nistic understanding of the pro
cess of differentiation ... but the 
developed methodology will be 
general enough to be applicable 
to any other lineage-specific dif
ferentiation, she said. Currently, 
researchers use their knowledge
could have been added to the 
end of chromosomes during DNA 
replication. This telomorase en
zyme is now known to provide 
a template with which DNA 
synthesis at the ends of chromo
somes can take place. Because of 
this ^discovery, it is now under
stood that telomerase can delay 
the aging of cells and that if the 
ends of chromosomes become 
shorter, the cell is getting older. 
This gives insight into dangerous 
cells, such as cancer cells, which 
have telomeres that do not seem 
to shorten.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry: 
Awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz, 
and Ada E. Yonath
The Nobel Prize for chemis
try was awarded to Venkatra
man Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. 
Steitz, and Ada E. Yonath for 
studies of the structure andfunction of the ribosome.
The three were each indepen
dently responsible for decoding 
the innermost workings of the 
ribosome, which is an integral 
part of the cells that make up our 
bodies. These ribosomes create 
the proteins that form the ba
sis of the building blocks of life, 
DNA and RNA.
Using a method called X-ray 
crystallography that uses X-rays 
to analyze the atomic structure 
of entities, the three laureates in
dependently constructed precise
3-D models of the ribosomes. 
This allowed other researchers 
to study them in much greater 
detail, opening up many new op
portunities. One area affected 
greatly was that of antibiotics. 
Indeed more than half of all an
tibiotics target the ribosome of 
bacteria. Greater knowledge of 
ribosomes enables antibiotics to 
be significantly more effective.
of organ development to recre
ate differentiation of stem cells 
in vitro, or in a laboratory, and 
this method is largely trial and 
error. Banerjees work will help 
researchers understand how 
pancreatic islet cells are derived 
from embryonic stem cells. Our 
integrated approach will provide 
mechanistic details of the func
tioning of embryonic stem cellderived pancreatic islet cells, and 
the predictive model will lay the 
foundation towards an informed 
decision-making in generating 
pancreatic islet cells of improved 
functionality. Keeping the main 
focus of her research in mind, 
Banerjee said, In summary, the 
impact will be in generating fully 
functional pancreatic islet cells 
which can be transplanted for 
treatment of diabetes. Another 
researcher at the University of 
Pittsburgh is Eric Lagasse, whose 
work involves lymph nodes.

Dinosaur prints 
found in France
Footprints belonging to the 
sauropod dinosaur were discov
ered near Lyon in France. These 
are tlie largest dinosaur prints 
to be found to date.
The tracks spread over hun
dreds of meters and research
ers plan to carry out more in
vestigation in the nearby area 
to find out whether it could be 
the largest space inhabited by 
dinosaurs.
The footprints are circular 
depressions surrounded by 
a layer of limestone and are 
around 1.5 meters in diameter. 
This suggests that the dinosaurs 
were probably 25 meters in 
length and may have weighed 
more than 40 tons.

NASA carries out 
moon crash
NASAs Lunar Crater Obser
vation and Sensing Satellite 
(LCROSS) mission, was carried 
out successfully on Friday and 
generated a good amount of 
data for NASA to analyze. The 
main objective of this mission 
was to check whether there is 
any water on the moon.
NASA spent nearly $79 mil
lion on the mission. Two space
craft were sent down into a 
crater on the moon, and the sci
entists wanted to test whether 
the impact with the inside of the 
crater would expel any water. 
Scientists said that after Friday, 
all of LCROSSs controls were 
working fine.
The spacecraft also hit a shad
owed area in the crater like the 
researchers had expected.

Scientists find clue 
to ear evolution
Paleontologists believe that 
studying the fossil of an ancient 
mammal, Maotherium asiaticus, may help us understand 
how the middle ear in humans 
and other mammals evolved.
An article on this subject 
was published in the journal 
Science.
In reptiles, a piece of cartilage 
called Meckels cartilage hard
ens after birth and connects the 
jaw and ear. In mammals, this 
structure is present in fetuses, 
but disappears later in life.
Maotherium shows the pres
ence of this structure, indicat
ing that it lies in the middle 
stage of development between 
reptiles and mammals.
Other characteristics of 
Maotherium, however, indicate 
that it is a mammal and shows 
features distinct to mammals.

Scientists see new 
ring around Saturn
Scientists from the University 
of Virginia have discovered a 
huge new ring around Saturn. 
The results, published in the 
journal Nature, indicate that 
this ring is the largest to be seen 
in the solar system.
The ring marks out the orbit of 
one of Saturns moons, Phoebe. 
Phoebe has an orbit with a ra
dius of around 8 million miles. 
Scientists believe that objects 
colliding with Phoebe caused 
the formation of a large amount 
of dust. This dust could have 
caused the formation of this 
ring.
The scientists believe that 
this ring is most similar to Jupi
ters rings, found in the orbits of 
two of Jupiters moons: Thebe 
and Amalthea.
The team used NASAs Spitzer 
Space Telescope to see the ring, 
which is tilted at an angle of 27 
degrees to the plane of the other 
rings of Saturn.

Health Talk: Hemispatial Neglect
Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons

sents the parietal lobe, which can cause neglect when damaged.

In hemispatial neglect syn
drome, according to Husain et 
al.s definition in the journal 
article Hemispatial Neglectx pa
tients are less aware of the stim
uli on one side of their body, but 
may not necessarily experience 
any sensory loss. This common 
but difficult-to-treat illness has 
forced doctors to gain more in
sight into the behavior and anat
omy of their patients.
The most common type of ne
glect is that of the left visual field 
and occurs after damage to the 
right hemisphere of the brain. 
Neglect of the left side is more 
common because there is re
dundant processing of the right 
visual space by both right and 
left hemispheres of the brain, 
whereas most of the left space is 
predominantly only processed 
by the right cerebral hemisphere. 
Thus, if the left hemisphere is 
damaged, the right hemisphere 
can take control of the right vi
sual space, but if the right hemi
sphere is damaged, there is no 
way for the brain to process stim
uli in the left visual space.
Hemispatial neglect usually 
occurs after brain injury, and the 
patient goes through a variety 
of debilitating behaviors. These 
behaviors include the persons 
inability to orient or respond to 
stimuli in the visual field oppo
site to the side of brain damage 
or lesion. Soon after a right-sided 
parietal lesion, the patient may 
not respond to the entire left side 
of their world. This causes the 
person to completely ignore the 
left side of their world as though 
it did not exist. The person will 
engage in behaviors such as only 
brushing the right set of their 
teeth, only combing the right side 
of their hair, or only dressing the 
right side of their bodies. They 
will not eat food that is on the left 
side of their plates and will only 
read half of a compound word 
(such as reading cream when 
they see ice cream or ball 
when they see football).
Neglect can be easily tested 
using simple bedside tasks. For 
example, from cases reported in 
Halligan and Robertsons Spatial 
Neglect: A Clinical Handbook for 
Diagnosis and Treatment, sim
ple tests like asking a patient to 
draw, copy, read, divide a line in 
half (line bisection), or cross out 
specific targets on a page (cancel
lation), will let the doctor know 
whether the person has neglect.
If a patient is asked to draw a 
clock, the patient will draw all 
six numbers of the right face of 
the clock. They will only copy 
half of a flower when given a 
picture of a whole flower. Also, 
if given a full page of horizontal 
lines and asked to cross vertically 
through all those lines, they will 
only cross through the lines on 
the right side of the page.
According to Freksa, Stiehl, 
and Zangemeister in their book 
Visual Attention and Cognition, 
currently there are three main 
hypotheses trying to explain ne
glect.
The first hypothesis is that 
neglect arises because central 
mechanisms in the brain fail to 
construct an internal represen
tation of one side of space. The 
second hypothesis suggests that 
neglect occurs after a failure to 
attend to stimuli in the region of 
space opposite to the hemisphere 
of damage because the person 
has difficulty disengaging atten
tion to targets on the same side 
as the damage. The last hypoth
esis is that hemispatial neglect 
can happen due to the persons 
inability to sustain movement 
toward or in the impaired visual 
field.
From previous studies, ves
tibular (the region of the inner 
ear that helps with balance) and 
optokinetic (movements of the 
eyes) stimulation may temporar
ily reduce the amount or severity 
of visual neglect. However, these 
treatments are not applicable for 
long-term relief.
Recently, Vallar et al. displayed 
that transcutaneous electrical 
stimulation (TENS) can be used 
to improve hemispatial neglect. 
TENS stimulation affects the 
nerve fibers that go to the brain, 
thus giving rise to more sensory 
input that goes to the brain.
Therefore multiple modalities 
(vestibular, optokinetic, and so
matosensory) are potentially ca
pable of helping to treat neglect 
syndrome, although much more 
work needs to be done to find a 
definite treatment.

How Things Work: Future 
Attribute Screening Technology
MICHAEL KAHN
Copy Manager
It is hard to argue that flying 
home for mid-semester break 
has gotten easier since Sept. 11. 
Security is tighter, lines are lon
ger, and anybody with a stan
dard tube of toothpaste could 
be a potential terrorist. In a few 
more years, however, these in
conveniences may be only bad 
memories, thanks to a project 
under development at the De
partment of Homeland Security 
(DHS). This project, known as 
the Future Attribute Screening 
Technology, aims to revolution
ize security screening in airports, 
stadiums, and other potential 
terrorist targets.
The Future Attribute Screen
ing Technology (FAST), formerly 
known as Project Hostile Intent, 
aims to detect potential secu
rity threats based on behavioral 
factors. Instead of trying to find 
bomb components in a suitcase, 
future security screeners will be 
able to identify telltale signs of 
deception, including subtle reac
tions to nervousness and aggres
sion. FAST consists of an array of 
sensors that work together to de
tect possible signs of hostile in
tent. Almost all of these sensors 
are commercially available, but 
the complete array and the soft
ware that makes it all work, are 
being developed by the Human 
Factors Division of the DHSs Sci
ence and Technology Director
ate. Work on the system began 
in 2007, and tests have been con
ducted throughout the past two 
years.
More realistic tests with a 
more compact array and random
subjects have recently been con
ducted, and researcher Daniel 
Martin claims that results have 
turned out significantly better 
than chance, according to an 
article published Oct. 6 on CNN. 
com. The FAST system is in many 
ways the technological successor 
to the polygraph. Both are based 
on the premise that physiologi
cal reactions are indicative of 
psychological attitudes. By com
bining data from all the avail
able sensors, analysts  be they 
human or software  should be 
able to identify individuals who 
match certain suspicious pro
files. According to a May 2007 
Department of Homeland Secu
rity newsletter, FAST involves 
two main processes: developing 
models that match physiologi
cal cues to threat level, and the 
actual creation of the hardware 
suite to detect these cues.
The combined system would 
be able to identify threats with
out a human screener, thereby 
eliminating both time and sub
jective bias from the screening 
process. One of the stated goals 
of the project is to perform this 
task without ever impeding the 
flow of travelers. While both of 
these tasks are on the cutting 
edge of science, DHS researchers 
have made significant progress. 
Model matching algorithms, 
particularly those dealing with 
human physical responses, have 
been at the forefront of machine 
learning research for several 
years, with many advances hap
pening here at Carnegie Mellon. 
The individual components of 
the FAST system, while available 
by themselves, have not previ
ously been used in such a com
plex environment, and research
ers also had to combine the data 
from these sensors into a mean
ingful result.
Proponents of FAST and simi
lar technologies believe that the 
future of security screening lies 
in being able to screen people, 
not their belongings. Their goal 
is to make screening more ac
curate and more rapid while re
ducing the controlled chaos that 
is an airport security line. These 
supporters hold that the variety 
of data sources will eliminate 
most false positives. As with any 
new technology, particularly 
new security technologies, FAST 
has no shortage of critics. Any 
system that collects the amount 
of data FAST does has signifi
cant privacy implications. While! 
members of the project maintain! 
that no data will be saved about 
an individual after screening, 
this does not satisfy skeptics 
who worry that what equates toi 
a detailed medical examination 
is being conducted without the! 
necessary safeguards.
Furthermore, some experts 
believe that the premise of physij 
ological detection is invalid. In 
an interview for the same CNN.. 
com story, Carnegie Mellons 
Stephen Fienberg, a university 
professor in the statistics anc} 
machine learning departments,; 
said, I havent seen any research 
that shows that those measures 
from the autonomic nervous sys-- 
tem... measuring blood pressure,

next revolutionary step in health

Students should consider

Library closings take away culture from city
Last Tuesday, the Carnegie Public 
Library of Pittsburgh voted on and an
nounced the closing of four of its branch
es throughout the city.
Effective Feb. 3, 2010, the Beechview, 
West End, Hazelwood, and Lawrenceville 
branches will be closed to the public. 
Additionally, the Carrick and Knoxville 
branches will merge, fines and fees ev
erywhere will increase, and the library 
board will implement other, more local
ized changes.
The seemingly sudden announcement 
to the public about the branch closings 
may demonstrate that even things we 
might consider immune from  or at 
least, isolated from  the economy are in 
fact at risk in these hard economic times. 
However, several members of the board 
explained to local news outlets that these 
changes were a long time in the works, 
possibly indicating that the economic re
cession may not be completely to blame
for the weakening of the library system, 
but may rather have been the icing on 
the cake already baked with a number of 
problems.
While we in the Oakland community 
are safe  the Oakland branch is the 
largest and most notable of the Pitts
burgh branches, and is supported by the 
close presence of Carnegie Mellon and 
the University of Pittsburgh  the future 
of other neighborhoods is not so secure. 
Blighted neighborhoods like Hazelwood 
need whatever small elements of outside 
culture and education they have to stay 
in their community.
However, the changes to the Carnegie 
library system are quickly turning into 
food for political debates among those 
vying for office in the upcoming elec
tions. For example, mayoral candidate 
Kevin Acklin has quickly admonished 
Mayor Luke Ravenstaal and the city of 
Pittsburgh for not contributing enough to
the failing library system  the city cur
rently gives $40,000 annually to the Car
negie Public Library of Pittsburgh  and 
has promised to increase that amount to 
$250,000 if elected.
Wild promises of an extra $200,000- 
plus  simply to win over voters early in 
the elections process  will not fix the 
system in the short term, and will not 
encourage outside donors to contribute 
before the four branches in question shut 
their doors in February.
We hope that the loud public outcry 
and protests that have erupted in the 
past week in reaction to the boards an
nouncement will be enough to turn the 
public library system around. While you 
still can, make sure that you visit the four 
branches that will be closing, or even just 
the Oakland branch next to Schenley 
Plaza. Experience the free culture that 
Pittsburgh has to offer before its too late 
for our shrinking city.
FCEs need to be made useful to students, staffLengthening school year is not 
the right way to increase scores
-------------------------------------------------- in our test scores, and where the highCl C /Ti school and college drop-out rates are 30
and 45 percent, respectively, according 
^ tVrw&s to the Department of Education, there is
SABRINA PORTER no doubt that something must be done.
Especially in a time of a strained econ
omy, the cost of adding more school time 
is not 'cheap. Programs that already ex
ist in some Massachusetts public schools 
have shown to cost between 12 and 15 
percent more that what is regularly allot
ted per student in most state budgets.
Many charter schools have imple
mented both longer school days, a school 
day every other Saturday, and a shorter 
summer vacation. It is true that these 
schools eighth-graders have shown to 
exceed their state district average scores. 
It is also true, however, that there are 
many other factors at play here. Students 
attending charter schools are often from 
more enriched societal backgrounds. 
Thus, a divide exists between higherand 
lower-scoring schools. Part of the work 
that must be done should be in evening 
out the education gap.
The President and education secretary 
should also recognize that reducing the 
time students get to take for themselves 
is decreasing a whole other side of educa
tion: the life experience side. American 
students need their breaks to remember 
that there is a life outside of school. 
It is clear that some change must come 
to American education. But, as of now, 
Obamas plan remains unconvincing and 
the answer yet unclear.
Regardless of whether students have 
what they believe to be either the best or 
worst professor in their entire academic 
career, it is highly unlikely that they will 
ever fill out the Faculty Course Evalu
ation (FCE) for the class unless theyre 
offered some highly elusive and coveted 
extra credit.
But that doesnt mean that the admin
istration is going to leave the evaluations 
as is. The Faculty Senate recently voted 
to increase the number of questions on 
the FCEs to 10, a number that had been 
lowered just a few years before.
The FCEs have the potential to serve a 
valuable purpose to the campus commu
nity: providing information about classes 
and professors that could help future stu
dents select the most rewarding classes.
They were originally created with exactly 
this intention in mind  Pi Kappa Theta fraternity decided back in 1968 that 
there was a need on campus for a way to 
evaluate classes and professors, and thus 
the FCEs were born and student-run for a 
number of years. .
At present, however, the FCEs dont 
serve the purpose that they are meant 
to. A very small number of students ac
tually fill them out, or if they do, theyre 
filling them out to get a homework grade 
dropped, or because they want to cause 
that professor as much pain as possible, 
and not really putting any thought into 
accurately evaluating the course. And an 
even smaller number of students actually 
look at these evaluations when choosing 
between one class or another due to the
limited amount of feedback that is avail
able for each.
So instead of changing the number of 
questions back and forth between two 
and 10 every few years, perhaps the focus 
should be more about the FCEs in gen
eral and how to make them useful to the 
students and fac^ty again. Regardless of 
how careful the sehstion about the num
ber of questions is, the FCEs are still irrel
evant until students actually start caring 
about filling them out ancn^ading them. 
The questions, while important, should 
not be the focus of changing FGEs; the 
focus should be finding a better process 
and vendor, encouraging students tofill 
them out, displaying the results in a bet
ter way, and explaining why they are use
ful to students and professors.
The college bubble may soon en
gulf even more of our lives, if President 
Obama and the Secretary of Education 
have it their way. They have proposed a 
lengthening of the required hours in a 
school day or in the school year. They be
lieve that in this global economy, Ameri
can test scores must compete with foreign 
ones, and more school is the answer.
Some flaws exist in this assumed causa
tion, however. First of all, American stu7 
dents already spend more time in classes 
than do many of the countries that con
sistently outscoresour students in stan
dardized tests. The Brookings Institution 
estimated that the average U.S. student 
spends about 1146 hours irtx^chool each 
year, as opposed to Singapore, Taiwan, 
Japan, and Hong Kong, who all average 
about 900-1000 annual hours. Ameri
cans do, however, spend a lesser portion 
of the year in school, with more break 
times than competitive countries.
According to researchers, these ex
tended breaks from school, such as the 
long-awaited summer vacation, have the 
potential to make or break a students ed
ucation. While wealthier children often 
are cared for academically by their par
ents, disadvantaged children fall prey to 
problems of poverty and a lack of paren
tal involvement, and fall behind in math 
and reasoning knowledge.
In a country where we continue to fail
Art on campus should invoke discussion, interest
graces our main grassy spaces: a couple of 
cranes putting back up fake people frozen 
in their journey into the sky, something 
reminiscent of the entrance to a coal mine, 
and a few additional random statues and 
sculptures. Do we wish there were more? 
Of course. More variety, more projects 
that last a couple of months, weeks, or 
even just days (remember the photo boxes 
from last spring?) to create more interest, 
more discussion, and a broader discovery 
of the excellent artists that exist on our 
campus.
Maybe someday we will have that
 art projects springing up out of the 
ground, creating controversy, dialogue, 
disappearing; and making way for new, 
more challenging, more controversial, 
more interesting pieces. But until then, 
we can keep taking pictures of those fi
berglass mannequins.
The pole is down.
Long live the pole.
With the un-eagerly anticipated resur
rection of Walking to the Sky sometime 
this week, our campus will once again 
be graced by a large metal rod hovering 
over the Cut. This new one should hope
fully not strike fear into the hearts of both 
campus administration and passersby as 
they stare at it swaying maniacally in the 
breeze. And isnt that a relief?
While this years seniors may hold on 
to memories of pre-college visits in the 
days before the erection of Walking to the 
Sky, the piece has become central to the 
fabric of the public art scene on campus. 
You might ask, what public art scene? Is 
there more than this giant stick?
And while yes, that is the biggest piece, 
we should not forget about the G20 dis
cussion space that grew out of the Fence
earlier this year, not to mention the Fence 
itself, and of course the big brown wedge. 
That awkward thing that stuck up out of 
the ground was removed this summer, 
and while not actually art, it was cover
ing broken art. But now  it is art again! 
That space has a newly installed ... shack, 
complete with functioning lightbulb and 
not quite so functioning audio recording 
of digging, which seems to have not quite 
lasted 24 hours, probably a fortunate 
technical malfunction.
There are a few other random pieces 
of art on campus  the awkward snow
man next to Doherty, the bizarre plant 
installation on the roof of the walkway 
between Doherty and Wean, and the 
backwards sentence on the outside wall 
of Posner Hall and the giant platform of 
numbers below.
Yes, this is the current variety of art that

Rotimi Abimbola & Adam Klein
All members of Carnegie Mellons Student Government are 
elected for one specific reason
 to promote the interests, val
ues, and activities of the Carn
egie Mellon student body. Over 
the past month, Adam and I, 
as Student Body Vice President 
and President, respectively, have 
placed special emphasis on sup
porting and representing student 
interests.
Though not encompassing all 
of our activities, our promotion of 
the Tartan Rewards Program, the 
G20 Awareness Fair, and efforts 
toward transparency have helped 
to direct the executive branch 
toward better serving Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Each initiative has been met 
with significant success. In the 
midst of the exciting and confus
ing time when the G20 was in 
Pittsburgh, the Student Govern
ment Executive Branch spear
headed the massive G20 Aware
ness Fair, which involved several 
student organizations, bands, and 
interest groups while offering 
a wealth of information to hun
dreds of students.
For the Tartan Rewards Pro
gram, we have worked to help the 
campus community better real
ize the benefits that come from 
supporting one another. In this 
same vein of supporting fellow 
students and organizations, we 
are also beginning to incorporate 
non-athletic activities into the 
program, as well as garnering 
student organization participa
tion and support in hosting games 
as well as participating in small 
competitions. The program has 
proven to be a greatly successful 
venture as we push for a greater 
sense of community here at Carn
egie Mellon.
Lastly, our transparency efforts 
such as the Mad Minute are new 
and innovative ways to offer lots 
of information about Student 
Governments activities and cam
pus happenings in a quick and 
easy way.
For the future, the Student 
Government Executive Branch 
is looking to continue to find in
novative ways to improve the stu
dent experience at Carnegie Mel
lon, as well as working toward 
greater transparency and student 
government reform, boosting the 
Tartan Rewards Program, and 
promoting the expanded Loop 
Bus, which shuttles students on 
the weekend to various popular 
social destinations throughout 
Pittsburgh.
For more information, please 
become a fan of the CMU Student 
Government Executive Branch on 
Facebook, and we will be sure to 
keep you informed. There are lit
erally dozens of new events hap
pening on campus each week, 
and we are working to better 
your Carnegie Mellon experience 
through proper representation 
and hard work.
Awarding of Nobel Prize to Obama undeservedly early
DOUGLAS MCINTYRE
On Friday, the Nobel commit
tee announced from their ivory 
tower in the far northern land of 
Norway that U.S. President Ba
rack Obama would be this years 
recipient of the much-lauded No
bel Peace Prize. The committee 
chair was quoted in The New York 
Times: The question we have 
to ask is who has done the most 
in the previous year to enhance 
peace in the world? Apparently, 
in his nine months as President, 
Obama has done more to effect 
world peace than anyone else 
anywhere, even while attending 
fancy dinners at Phipps Conservatory and lamenting that he 
didnt get any of Pamelas pan
cakes.
I must start by saying that I was 
most certainly one of the major
ity of Pittsburghers who cheered 
when Obama took Pennsylva
nia in Novembers election and 
once again when his victory in 
California cinched his seat in the 
Presidency. It also certainly can
not be denied that the rest of the 
world  especially Europe  was 
pleased to see Obama win, though
many were likely disappointed 
they could no longer use their 
collection of eight years worth of 
George Bush jibes. They wont un
derestimate us any longer.
The committees official rea
soning behind the choice of 
Obama, according to the same 
New York Times article, was his 
commitment to nuclear disarma
ment and his efforts to engage 
the rest of the world in more con
structive dialogue than that of his 
predecessor.
Both of these goals are, of 
course, very noble pursuits. After 
all, how useful is it for Random 
Country Number One to be able 
to say, Random Country Num
ber Two, we have enough arms to 
obliterate your population 3500 
times? Nuclear weapons have 
proven to serve nothing more 
than a potential threat to other 
countries since we slaughtered 
over 100,000 Japanese in Hiro
shima and Nagasaki  as esti
mated in The Avalon Project of 
Yales law school  and crippled 
many thousands more, even years 
later.
But while nuclear disarmament 
is certainly a significant goal, 
Obamas efforts have not changed 
much in the level of nuclear ar
mament in the world. The Associ
ated Press reported last Monday
that Kim Jong II said North Korea 
is willing to attend multilateral 
talks ... depending on the prog
ress in its talks with the United 
States. So if Kim thinks Obama is 
nice enough, he will consider dis
cussing the possibility of reducing 
its nuclear arms. Thats progress.
Obama has been selected 
for one of the most prestigious 
awards in the world based on 
this progress. But, of course, the 
Nobel committee insists that 
they did not select Obama based 
on his potential, but the work he 
has already accomplished, work 
like his extraordinary efforts to 
strengthen international diplo
macy and cooperation between 
peoples, along with his prefer
ence for negotiation and his vi
sion of a cooperative world of 
shared values, an Oct. 9 New York 
Times reported.
This years Nobel Prize in medi
cine went to a group of scientists 
who discovered that the shorten
ing of the ends of chromosomes is 
important in clocking the life span 
of a cell  information that may 
be significant in learning more 
about cancer cells, whose chro
mosomes do not shorten. Herta 
Mller was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in literature for a series of 
works censored in her native Ro
mania because of her depiction
of the political landscape of the 
country.
In short, the other Nobel laure
ates this year deserved the award 
for groundbreaking achievements 
and significant contributions to 
their respective fields. Obama was 
granted an award because he has 
a commitment to making future 
changes. While I certainly did not 
evaluate the 205 nominations the 
committee received for their in
dividual contributions, I can only 
assume at least one person on the 
list must have made an actual ac
complishment worth noting.
Even Obama was surprised at 
his selection, saying I do not feel 
that I deserve to be in the company 
of so many of the transformative 
figures who have been honored 
by this prize, men and women 
whove inspired me and inspired 
the entire world through their 
courageous pursuit of peace.
While this humbling state
ment is the mark of a well-honed 
public speaker  and would be 
the correct thing to say even if 
Obama was certain he deserved 
the award  when the President 
himself says he doesnt deserve 
the award, what can the rest of 
America and the world do but fol
low suit?
Frances president, Nicolas 
Sarkozy, referenced the award as
Americas return to the hearts of 
the worlds peoples.
Others attribute the selection as 
the worlds relief to see Bush out 
of office. From our standpoint, 
you know, we think that this gives 
us a sense of momentum, said 
State Department spokesman P.J. 
Crowley in a Fox News article, 
when the United States has acco
lades tossed its way, rather than 
shoes, referring to an incident 
in 2008 when an Iraqi reporter 
threw a shoe at President Bush 
during a news conference.
Regardless of why he was cho
sen, Obamas award represents 
poor judgment on the part of the 
committee, who unanimously 
voted on the selection. As impres
sive and significant as Obamas 
promises are, they are still just 
promises, and as most everyone 
recognizes, campaign promises 
are worth about as much as the 
paper they are written on. The 
only good thing that can be said 
at this point is that Obama in
tends to give all of his $1.4 million 
of reward money to charity.
Douglas McIntyre (drmcinty@) 
is the editor-in-chief of The Tar
tan and wishes he could have been 
awarded his masters degree based 
on his potential contributions to 
the field.
Mid-semester break is quickly approaching, and many students want to get away from CMU during this time. So we asked,
If you could go anywhere for a quick trip, where would you go?

Freedom of speech, media limited in South America
________HEATHER TOMKO ___
Writing for a newspaper, it is 
fairly obvious that freedom of

to have opinions and write about 
them without having to worry 
about whether Ill get in trouble 
for what I believe. I sometimes 
take this freedom for granted, 
and it is difficult for me to wrap 
my head around the thought that 
people in other countries do not 
all share this same freedom; in 
fact, some countries are taking 
steps backward in regard to free 
speech.
Recently, leaders of several 
Latin American countries have 
taken steps to limit the freedom of 
speech and freedom of the press 
of their citizens. According to a 
Tribune-Review article, in Venezu
ela, Hugo Chavez removed the li
censes of 32 private radio stations 
along with two television stations 
and is threatening to shut down 
even more for supposed tech
nical reasons. The article also 
gives the example of President 
Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, who 
wants to force all private media 
reporters to join a guild that is af
filiated with his Sandinista Party, 
and of President Cristina Fernan
dez in Argentina, who is trying 
to increase the number of stateowned broadcasters while simul
taneously decreasing the number 
of private ones.
These examples on their own 
would be disheartening enough
 proof that in some countries, 
leaders are trying to minimize 
freedom of speech as much as 
possible. Freedom of speech is a 
vital component of any successful 
nation, because people must be 
able to challenge their govern
ment and must be able to make 
their wants and needs known,
without fear of consequences. 
However, it is not just the limit
ing of freedom of speech in these 
countries that is something to 
question. What is even more wor
risome is the motivation behind 
the decision to limit freedom.
Ortegas push to have all pri
vate reporters join a guild affili
ated with his own political party 
is the best example of the reasons 
behind the desire to limit freedom 
of speech in many Latin American 
countries  politics. By limiting 
what group media reporters can 
be affiliated with, Ortega now 
has the power to limit what they 
report about and what spin they 
give news topics. Even if the edict 
isnt coming directly from Ortega
 or any other president  he is 
still behind it. And this gives him 
direct control over what type of 
information every citizen of his 
country receives.
Freedom of speech is intended 
to give everyone the opportunity 
to speak up for what they believe 
in, not to feel like they have to 
conform to others beliefs, to 
gain support for an underdog 
of a cause by getting the word 
out. And there is no subject that 
needs freedom of speech more 
than politics. There will always 
be differing political opinions, 
and because of this, people will 
always want to express which 
one they believe is right  and 
should be able to do so. But it is 
not only the ability to have ones 
own opinion that is important. In 
many South American countries, 
citizens are not happy with their 
governments and are trying to 
speak out against their leaders 
and stand up for what they want. 
Instead of listening and trying to 
make appropriate changes, how
ever, South American leaders are 
trying to squash those unyielding 
voices so that they dont have to 
change anything, so that the only 
news that is portrayed is good 
news.
In controlling the media, the
South American governments 
can essentially have control over 
all aspects of these peoples lives. 
The government would be able to 
stop any reports of any dissenting 
political factions and would even 
be able to get the media to re
port false election results if they 
gained complete and total con
trol. Its a steep and slippery slope 
from limiting freedom of speech 
to taking it away completely, and 
neither action is the correct one 
for government leaders.
Instead of limiting the freedom 
of speech of their people, the 
leaders of South American coun
tries should, instead, welcome 
it and work with their people 
instead of against them to help 
improve their country. People of 
dissenting beliefs surely have le
gitimate concerns and criticisms 
with the current government, 
both in South American coun
tries and elsewhere. And only by 
listening to those concerns and 
criticisms will the country and 
the government be able to grow, 
rather than trying to maintain the 
status quo and becoming com
pletely removed from the people 
they govern.
Although it is South American
countries that are currently try
ing to limit freedoms of speech 
and the press, that does not mean 
that this lesson does not apply to 
other countries as well. All lead
ers should be reminded to really 
listen to their people and to keep 
in mind both what they think will 
be best for the people, as well as 
what the people want, when mak
ing decisions for their country.

DEVIN BEAHM
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon volley
ball team got off to a rough start 
as they traveled to Rochester, 
N.Y. last weekend for the open
ing round robin of University 
Athletic Association play. The 
team played New York University 
on Saturday and third-ranked 
Emory University in their first 
match Sunday but fell 0-3 to 
both teams.
Their luck improved later in 
the day against the University of 
Chicago, when they triumphed 
over the Maroons 3-2. The 
Tartans record for UAA play cur
rently stands at 1-2.
The team was up against NYU 
to open up the first tournament 
of the UAA season. After the 
Tartans started off the first set 
up 7-3, the Violets rallied back, 
sending the Tartans to a 22-25 
loss. Carnegie Mellon went on to 
drop the next two games 12-25,
16-25 to wrap up the match.
Junior Caroline Size led the 
attack with a recorded seven kills 
while junior Cameron Griffin led 
the backline with 10 digs.
To start off Sunday, Carnegie 
Mellon dropped a harsh deci
sion against Emory 0-3 with 
the scores of 23-25, 13-25, 
14-25. Seniors Jess Brackin and 
Megan Killeen each recorded a 
total of seven kills in the game. 
Senior setter Sam Carter also fin
ished the game with 29 assists 
and three digs. Junior Aislinn 
McCloskey also played well with 
seven kills.
In their second matchup on 
Sunday, Carnegie Mellon found 
their way to victory over the 
University of Chicago 3-2. After 
losing the first game 19-25, the 
Tartans brought it back by win
ning the next two games 25-18 
and 25-22 to take a 2-1 lead. 
Chicago pushed back at the 
Tartans win in the fourth game 
25-21, but the Tartans were able 
to pull it out in the end, finishing 
game five 15-9. McCloskey led
the attack with 12 kills, followed 
by Carter with a total of 40 assists 
and 12 digs.
Griffin was optimistic about 
this past weekend despite injur
ing her elbow on the first days 
match. I felt that my team really 
stepped up their play in order 
to help me out. We really came 
together on the second day of the 
tournament, and we played as a 
cohesive unit, she observed.
Carter tried to bring up the 
teams energy as she worked to 
fire up the team by focusing on 
and calling out positive and crazy 
plays. Carter also believed her 
team played well this weekend, 
saying, We still passed  set and 
hit with a lot of success  but 
we need .to focus on perfecting 
everything since our conference 
is full of teams that lead Division
III volleyball.
The Tartans hosted Thomas 
More College on Sunday Oct. 11 
at 2:30 p.m. They will head to 
New York City for the second 
UAA round robin on Oct. 17-18.

Tam continued the success with 
wins, while Hart ended her suc
cessful singles day with another 
dominating victory 6-2, 6-0. 
Liebowitz and Brant also won 
their matches to secure the shut
out victory.
I think these matches are 
a good indicator of favorable 
results to come, Hart said about 
the two 9-0 shutouts. Weve 
been working really hard dur
ing practice, and its nice to see 
it pay off. I think we all played 
pretty decently today.
Chen also shared her team
mates excitement. We have 
been focusing on working on 
little things during practice, 
such as short crosscourt angles 
and moving forward during 
doubles. I think this gives us 
an extra edge, she commented. 
Hopefully we can keep up this 
success next semester when the 
spring season starts.
The womens fall season will 
come to an end after Chen and 
Herrick travel to Alabama Oct.

Mens tennis loses to Duquesne
TENNIS,fromA12
gles tournament last year, making 
him a three-time champion.
After a quick recovery from the 
weekend, the Tartans teamed up 
to face local Duquesne University, 
hoping to repeat last years win. 
Muliawan and Ljuboja lost by just a 
few points, 9-8(8) at first doubles. 
The lone doubles point came from 
the team of Nemerov and junior 
Bobby MacTaggart, 8-3. The score 
stood at 1-2 after doubles play.
However, singles play did not 
yield the expected results for the 
Tartans, who needed to take five 
out of the six matches. The two 
remaining points would come from 
MacTaggart, who upset his oppo
nent at first singles 4-6, 7-5, 10-6, 
and Nemerov, who overpowered 
his opponent 6-4, 6-4 at second 
singles.
Senior Jon Spero offered his 
insight on the loss. We had the 
opportunity to win all three dou
bles but were unable to do so.... I 
also had a set point in the first set 
so it was really a few points that 
separated us from a win, he noted. 
This match was really meant to be 
a warmup for Amherst and I think 
it served its purpose. Everyone 
knows they need to pick their play 
up a notch and hopefully we can 
do that.

Amherst University at home on

are. After they graduate, some 
of them keep running  Brian 
is obviously still in great shape 
 but a lot of them really cant

Womens soccer tops Mount Union
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom
ens soccer team carried over its 
momentum from previous match
es to triumph over Mount Union 
College 4-1 last Wednesday, 
bringing their overall season 
record to 5-4-1.
The Tartans opened the game 
strong, setting the tone with a 
goal off a corner kick by junior 
Alice Mayfield just five minutes 
into the game. With the ball 
rolling in favor of the Tartans, 
sophomore Elsa Wu followed suit 
four minutes later and scored the 
second goal of the game with an 
assist by Mayfield to bring the 
score to 2-0. It was Wus teamleading fifth goal and 10th poiht 
on the season.
Halfway into the 13th minute, 
junior Emily Overstreet started
play with a corner kick, and 15 
seconds later, sophomore Nicole 
Bayley scored the teams .third 
goal. The Tartans kept their 
defense strong, with the first of 
three saves by Anya Rosen just a 
minute later.
Mount Union finally broke 
through the Tartans powerful 
defense with 15 minutes to go in 
the period with a goal by Raider 
Ashley Kuhn to bring the score 
to 3-1. This did not hinder the 
Tartans, however, who contin
ued to push back against Mount 
Union to keep the score at 3-1 
until the end of the first period, 
during which Rosen recorded 
two more saves.
The second quarter saw its fair 
share of action from the Tartans, 
with Wu kicking things off 
again with an attempted header. 
Mayfield garnered her second 
assist of the game, and first-year
Lissie Arndt shot the ball past 
Mount Unions goalie two min
utes later to give the Tartans a 
three-goal lead, 4-1. The two 
teams continued back-and-forth 
play for the rest of the period, 
but neither team relinquished 
any further goals.
I think we really came 
together and played as a team. 
Everyone contributed so we were 
not depending on just one per
son, observed Bayley. Our game 
has improved greatly, but we still 
need to work on putting a full 90 
minutes together. We have the 
opportunity to beat [Washington 
University in St. Louis] and end 
up as one of the top teams in the 
UAAs.
The Tartans also played Sunday 
against number 18 Washington 
University in St. Louis at 1:30 
p.m. Check online Tuesday for 
results.
Fairweather fans, the Tartans 
bandwagon is passing though
LAUREN HIRATA
Junior Staffwriter
Sports fans, we all have that 
friend, and you know who Im 
talking about: hes the number 
one Steelers fan, but doesnt 
know anything about them other 
than the fact that the they just 
won the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh 
is just the ultimate sports town, 
he says, seeing as the Penguins 
just won the Stanley Cup too. 
But hes the one who heckles you 
for staying true to the Pirates 
even though they havent had 
a winning season for 17 years 
because his Phillies won the 
World Series last year; it doesnt 
matter that hes never been to 
Philadelphia in his life. Oh, and 
no matter that Pittsburgh doesnt 
have a basketball team  the Los 
Angeles Lakers just won the NBA 
championship!
We all know him  the fairweather fan, or bandwagon fan.
But as annoying as bandwagoners are, and as much as I dis
like them, I admit that they add 
to team spirit.
Hailing from Los Angeles, I 
have been brought up a Lakers 
fan. However, as great a city as 
Los Angeles is, it doesnt have a 
football team. But when I arrived 
at Carnegie Mellon last year, the 
Steelers just so happened to win
the Super Bowl six months later. 
Without hesitation, I hopped 
on the Steelers bandwagon and 
(safely and not destructively) 
rioted in celebration.
As much as I hated the Lakers 
fairweather fans when I was back 
at home, I have a new perspective 
now that I am coming from the 
other side. After the Steelers won, 
they gave me a reason to watch 
professional football, as well as 
another reason to be proud of 
my adopted hometown. Rooting 
for the same team has allowed 
me to connect to other fans, be 
they hardcore third-generation 
Steelers fans or bandwagoners 
like myself.
So'my suggestion to you, the 
Carnegie Mellon student popula
tion, is to jump on a bandwagon! 
And I have the perfect wagon for 
you to jump on: Tartan athletics.
Carnegie Mellon is known 
for its intense team spirit, if 
you count the computer science 
department as a team. Contrary 
to the overwhelming recognition 
academics receives, support at 
athletic events is lacking, even 
though we have all reasons to be 
loyal to our athletes.
Currently, our football, ten
nis, soccer, volleyball, and cross 
country teams are doing excep
tionally well. We have even fos
tered several University Athletic
Association players of the week. 
Despite our athletic teams 
accomplishments, event atten
dance is laughable. It seems like 
the only people in the stands are 
those who personally know or 
are related to an athlete.
The Student Athlete Advisory 
Council (SAAC) has taken note 
of this display of poor attendance 
and has instated the Tartan 
Rewards Program, which pro
motes event attendance through 
giveaways, prizes, raffles, and 
even a SuperFan banquet that 
will be held at the end of the 
year. Hopping on the Tartan ath
letics bandwagon doesnt sound 
so bad now, does it?
Pittsburgh is the city of cham
pions. Carnegie Mellon nurtures 
its students to become champi
ons in their respective academic 
fields. Tartan athletics can com
bine the two to create a dynamite 
school spirit thatwill resonate 
throughout your college experi
ence. Therefore, attendance at 
such events should be part of 
every Carnegie Mellon students 
life. Although Tartan athletics 
obviously cannot compare to the 
grandeur of Division I sports, 
going to games promotes school 
spirit and shows support for your 
classmates  not to mention get
ting you out of those windowless

The past two weeks have 
been busy for the mens ten
nis team, who competed at 
the ITA Southeast Regional 
Championships in Virginia, 
where seniors James Muliawan 
and Niko Ljuboja captured the 
doubles title. A week later, the 
mens team fell to Division I 
Duquesne University 3-6 to bring
their season record to 2-1.
In Virginia, the Tartans did not 
have as much luck with the sin
gles tournament, with only two 
players  seventh-seeded junior 
Alex Nemerov and ninth-seeded 
first-year Duke Miller  surviv
ing until the quarterfinals.
Doubles play saw better luck, 
with three Tartan teams making 
the second dayof the tournament. 
Muliawan and Ljuboja got off to a 
rough start, barely scraping by in 
the first match 9-7 before rally
ing to win their second match 8-1 
against a Washington and Lee 
team. Sophomore Jeremy King 
and Miller teamed up and upset 
the first-seeded Johns Hopkins 
team 8-4 and then crushed a 
W&L team 8-1. Nemerov and 
senior Ravi Raghavan were the 
third duo to make the quarter
finals, beating out teams from 
W&L and Hopkins 8-5 and 8-6, 
respectively.
During the second day of the 
tournament, Muliawan and 
Ljuboja defeated another Hopkins 
team 8-6 to make the semifinals. 
King and Miller had an easy vic
tory 8-3 to advance to the semi
finals as well, only to be defeated 
by their teammates 8-6. In the 
other half of the draw, Nemerov 
and Raghavan dropped an 8-1 
decision to the second seed from 
Salisbury University.
In the finals of the doubles tour
nament, Muliawan and Ljuboja 
battled for their second ITA dou
bles title. The pair had teamed 
up during their first-year year to 
win the title. After starting slow, 
the two found themselves down 
a set 6-1. The duo fought back 
and took the second set 6-3. The 
resulting tiebreak was a nail-biter 
as the lead ping-ponged between 
Carnegie and Salisbury. Finally, 
Muliawan and Ljuboja were able 
to take a three-point lead before 
closing out the match, 10-8. The 
two will travel to Mobile, Ala. this 
week to participate in the ITA 
National Championships.
It feels pretty good, and brings 
back lots of memories, Muliawan 
said of his previous wins. Its 
really good playing with Niko, 
and its been a good partnership.

As the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans football 
team looks to main
tain their longstanding 
streak of winning sea
sons, they are getting 
some profitable help, 
from outside lineback
er and punter Richard 
Pattison in securing 
their victories. Last 
season, Pattison was 
named to the University 
Athletic Association 
Special Teams First 
Team, as well as being 
selected as Academic 
A! ! District. Recently 
named the UAAs 
Special Teams Athlete 
of the Week, Pattison 
consistently performs 
to get the Tartans in 
good position to end up 
on the left side of the 
final score.
A junior from Rocky 
River, Ohio, Pattison 
has been playing foot
ball since the fifth 
grade. Although he has 
played basketball his 
entire life and consid
ered playing in college, 
Pattison took his inspi
ration from his favorite 
professional team, the 
Cleveland Browns, and 
joined the Carnegie 
Mellon squad. Pattison 
is able to perpetuate 
his first love of basket
ball by playing for his
fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, 
in the intramural league 
and in pickup games dur
ing the football off-season. 
When hes not studying, 
honing his football skills, 
or waiting for the chance 
for a comeback from the 
Beta LeBrons second place 
finish last year in intramu
rals, Pattison enjoys watch
ing comedy movies with 
friends to laugh away some 
of the stress of a busy col
lege schedule.
Pattison is also becoming 
a member of Tau Beta Pi, 
which is the national hon
ors engineering fraternity. 
As a chemical engineering 
major, Pattison cites that 
being a Carnegie Mellon 
student athlete makes him 
wish there were more time 
in a day to balance aca
demics and athletics. When 
all of his hard work pays 
off, Pattison notes that he 
would like to repay his par
ents for their continuous 
support even while he is 
currently away from home 
to attend school and focus 
on football. Until then, 
Pattison can take pride in 
his achievements on and 
off the football field and 
enjoy the friendships he 
values with his classmates, 
fraternity brothers, and 
teammates, while keeping 
the goal of another winning 
season for the Tartans in 
the forefront.

The Tartans womens ten
nis team had their first two dual 
matches of the season as they 
steamrolled their opponents on 
Saturday. They first shut out Case 
Western Reserve University, 9-0, 
before doing the same to Oberlin 
College. The victories kept their 
momentum going after a very suc
cessful ITA Regional tournament.
The Tartans first blowout vic
tory began at noon on Saturday 
against fellow University Athletic

The Tartan football team played 
against the Allegheny Gators this 
past Saturday at Gesling Stadium. 
They battled for just under three 
hours and forced the Gators to 
play their best. Despite their dili
gent efforts, the Tartans fell just 
short of victory with a final score 
of 38-35. Their season record 
stands at 4-2.
After just about 10 minutes, 
Allegheny had already taken the 
lead with a 63-yard drive and a 
subsequent 32-yard field goal by 
the Gators kicker Ryan Zipf. But 
the Cardinal and Gray struck back 
immediately. Two senior Tartans, 
Phil Pantelone and Brendan 
Howe, came up clutch with an 
81-yard drive and a 3-yard touch
down followed up by junior Elliot 
Carnevales extra point, making 
the score 7-3 just before the end
of the first quarter.
As the second quarter came to 
a close, the Tartans were able to 
hold on to the 14-10 lead over 
the Gators after a touchdown 
by first-year Jake Nardone and 
a rival touchdown by Allegheny 
quarterback T.J. Salopek.
The Tartans and Gators battled 
closely in the second half, strug
gling back and forth to keep the 
lead. The Gators came out of the 
gate ready to score after halftime. 
They capitalized on a Tartan 
fumble, making a 17-yard run to 
score another 6 points, followed 
by a successful field goal.
The Gators followed it up with 
some challenging defense shut
ting down the Tartans with a 
three-and-out. With the ball in 
the hands of the Gators again, the 
Tartans were unable to stop the
17-yard run by Brian Tambulin 
causing them to slide further from 
the lead at a score of 24-14.
But the diligent Tartans fought 
on, led by Howe, who caught a 
glimpse of sophomore running 
back Chris Garcia, and got the 
ball to him from 62 yards away. 
This narrowed the gap for the 
Cardinal and Gray to 24-21. This 
was not the end of the roll for the 
Tartans. After a tough defensive 
stop against the Gators, Pantelone 
found another sophomore for an 
8-yard touchdown  this time in 
Zach Gallup  to take the lead 
back for the first time since the 
first quarter, at 28-24. But the 
Tartan lead didnt last long, as 
the Gators scored another touch
down just five minutes later, mak
ing the score 31-28.
Again, the lead went further in 
the favor of the Gators due to a 
Tartan fumble, making the score 
of the game 38-28. The duo of 
Pantelone and Gallup connected 
again to keep the hope of the 
Tartans alive, making the score
38-35 with 3:35 to play. After a 
Tartan unsuccessful onside kick 
and a quick fumble recovered 
by the Tartan sophomore Ray 
Johnson, the Tartans were set 
for victory on the 27 yard line. 
However, the Gator defense was 
just too tough, sacking Pantelone 
twice and maintaining their lead 
to shut the Tartans down with a 
final score of 38-35.
The Tartans suffered a loss, but 
played a great game.
It was pretty disappointing, 
and I thought we didnt do a 
good job of controlling the ball. 
We could have pulled it out at the 
end, but we didnt do a good job 
of protecting the quarterback, 
junior wide receiver John Staso 
said. We have a real tough game 
ahead of us against a good team, 
and we need to stay focused.
In two weeks, the Tartans 
will travel to play Wittenburg in 
Springfield, Ohio.
Cross country sweeps home invitational
ITA tournament, kicked things off 
with victories at first and second 
singles respectively. First-year 
Alex Tapak battled to victory in 
her match up, 6-4, 7-5 and junior 
Jen Chui, Liebowitz, and Hart 
each won their singles matches as 
well, with Hart once again shut
ting out her opponent, 6-0, 6-0.
Senior Alisa Liebowitz shared 
her opinion of the sweep against 
Case Western. Cases lineup was 
stronger this year, and it was a 
good test to see if we could step it 
up a level in our first dual match. 
One thing we need to work on, 
however, is the mental aspect of 
our games. We tend to get a lead 
but at times let the opponent start 
to come back.
Three hours later, the Tartans 
did away with Oberlin, once again 
with relative ease. Each doubles 
team  Chen/Herrick, Chui/ 
Tapak, and Brant/Tam  won 
their respective matches by 8-3 
scores. Playing at first singles this 
time, Chin outdid her opponent

with two 6-1 set wins to take her 
second match of the day. Chui and

On Saturday, the annual 
Carnegie Mellon Cross Country 
Invitational took place at Schenley 
Park. The invitational was a 
huge success, with 18 teams and 
over 300 athletes participating. 
Despite the fierce competition, 
Carnegie Mellons runners rose 
to the top. Both teams placed first 
overall, .with the men scoring 29

points and the women scoring 54 
points. The men competed in an 
8K and the women raced a 5K.
The depth of talent present on 
the mens team shined through 
at the Invitational as five of the 
Tartans finished in the top 10. 
Junior Dan Addis finished third 
overall with a time of 25:56.13, 
followed closely by junior J.P. 
Allera (26:02.99) and sopho
more Matt Jacob (26:04.41), who 
placed fourth and fifth. Junior
Nate Bussiere earned eighth place 
with a time of 26:30.39, pursued 
by senior Dario Donatelli, who 
finished ninth in 26:35.15.
Allera was pleased with the 
results for the mens team. He 
said, I feel like the team per
formed pretty well this week. We 
didnt have a big gap between our 
runners. We dont have [2009 
graduate] Brian Harvey any
more, so we dont have any guys 
really far up [in the pankings],
Kristen Severson/Photo Editor
but we all finished right around 
the same time, which was really 
nice; our spread was really low. I 
think this was a good race to get 
us in a postseason mood. We set 
the bar for the next few weeks. 
One thing that made the

team was the opportunity to

Bible of food world goes out of print
Cooks and connoisseurs mourn the end of GourmetEverything you need to know
About first dates and being a gentleman
On Oct. 5, Conde Nast, publisher of famous 
magazines like Vogue and The New Yorker, 
announced in its memo that the November 2009 
issue of Gourmet will be the last for this 70-yearold magazine. Gourmet is a magazine about food; 
about how food centers our lives; how just like 
culture, people, and thought are the backdrop 
of society, they are the plate for food. This 
announcement will have many repercussions, 
mainly in the landscape of food journalism and 
in the lives of people who are hooked on this 
magazine.
The memo from Conde Nast was not personal; 
it was just business. Looking back, the newer 
issues of Gourmet, especially the issues 
published this year, are thinner compared to 
those of 2007. With an increasing number of 
food magazines and Internet blogs, people can 
just use Google to troubleshoot their cooking 
dilemmas  all for free! It is no wonder, then, 
that Gourmet's readership has taken a hit.
Many people are of the opinion that Gourmet is 
out of date. The magazine has become irrelevant 
in a day and age where more space in the 
supermarket is given to boxed, packed, and 
frozen food than fresh produce. Ultimately, the 
closing of Gourmet is a reflection of the fact that 
people prefer a quicker way to cook. Gourmet 
is not full of quick meals that compromise on

flavor but contains recipes for those who enjoy 
cooking and are not looking for shortcuts. In this 
magazine, recipes are well-experimented, so one 
always ends up with a delicious meal, j,
More than being just a magazine containing 
recipes, Gourmet understands food for what it 
is and what it should be. While many critics say 
that Gourmet is too fancy and only praises chefs 
who cook a $700 meal, they forget that, at the 
same time, Gourmet also features cheap street 
food from around the world. This is not to say 
that the magazine covers every income level, but

volumes of cookbooks published since the '70s.
shows that it realizes the true potential of food.
At a certain level, Gourmet is almost like art.
With all the glory that Gourmet gets for dining 
and talking to Michelin star chefs, the editors! 
remember that its about food and not about 
the convention. In 2008, there was an issue 
dedicated to Italian-American food. The concept 
was deemed as not traditional, not real, and 
therefore not good food. But Gourmet thinks of 
food as a reflection of changes in the culture and 
the way people are living. Americanized Italian, 
or Americanized Chinese, cuisine is just like any 
other cuisine, and it evolves.
The New York Times surprised me when 
it described Gourmet as "sexy, well-read, 
globetrotting. I always think of the magazine as 
rich, complex, and comfortable  I can read it 
anywhere and immerse myself in reading about 
how turkey gravy is velvety smooth or how the 
wine was just a country white, but poured with 
a generous hand from an endless bottle. I did 
not grow up reading Gourmet as many people 
did, but when I chose to study food, Gourmet 
was my textbook.
Numerous James Beard Awards, a.k.a. the 
Academy Awards of the food world, do not 
guarantee the success of what The New York 
Times called the foodie's New Yorker. Food 
lovers are saddened by the pre-manufactured, 
processed, and unemotional relationship 
Americans have with their food, but this 
relationship can be altered, and when the right 
moment comes, I believe that Gourmet will come 
back.

Dear Prerna,
I am very excited. Wait, I am very 
nervous. No, excited. Maybe just 
a combination of both. Well, the 
thing is that I am going on my 
very first date. Ever. Yes, it may 
seem weird that I have never 
dated before, but I finally found a 
girl that interests me. We usually 
do math homework together and 
its fun. Anyway, I dont know 
how to act on this date, what to 
do, or where to take her. Should I 
give her a good night kiss or not 
at the end of the date? I want 
this to be her best date. Help 
me, please.
A Worried Wooer
Dear Worried,
Aww, its your first date! You should 
be excited and not nervous at all. 
After your first date, youll realize 
that along with the date comes the 
unnecessary hype. Im going to tell 
you a big secret: Be yourself on this 
date. Your girl is waiting for a date 
with the boy she does math with, 
so give her exactly what she wants, 
and depending on the type of girl 
she is, plan your evening.
Usually, you would like to keep the 
first date simple, yet fun  a good 
way you both can get to know each 
other. Take her to the movies or out 
for dinner. I would recommend you 
keep schoolwork out of the topic. 
Compliment her at the beginning of 
the date, and give her your constant 
attention throughout, but dont get 
imposing.
About the kiss, depending on 
how the date goes, you can make 
your move. Usually, the girl gives 
indications, so if shes hanging 
around after the date or is being 
flirty, I think she's ready for you to 
make your move. But remember: 
Slow and steady wins the race. If it 
doesn't work out, come to me and 
we can find you a pretty lady.
Enjoy the date!
-Prerna
Dear Prerna,
I have a simple, yet muchdebated, question  should I 
pay for every date? The thing is, 
Im a gentleman  the holdingdoors-open-and-picking-upthe-check kind of guy. Sadly, 
some girls think that its a bit 
too much. My problem is that I 
grew up in an environment that 
makes me think its necessary to 
be chivalrous. Also, nowadays I 
have noticed that when I dont 
pick up the check, I am given 
dirty looks. What should I do?
Old-Fashioned Fella
Hey OFF,
Being agirl, Icananswerthisquestion 
from the bottom of my heart: Id love 
a chivalrous man. Who doesnt like 
a man who holds the door open and 
is polite? However, over time I have 
come across many girls who find 
chivalry annoying and others who 
take it for granted. So I suggest that 
if you see a pretty girl holding a big 
stack of books and she looks like 
shes going to fall over, ask her if she 
needs help. Dont force yourself on 
her, but be the gentleman that you 
are. Every girl loves to be helped as 
long as she doesnt seem helpless.
Also, on a date, I would recommend 
you use the line Oh, let me get this 
one, and how about you get the 
next?" You're subtly suggesting a 
second date, as well as saying that 
you are open to her paying for the 
meal next time, and not provoking 
her feminist side. You will definitely 
find that special girl who loves your 
chivalry and you just the way you 
are.
Good luck,
Prerna

Tales from abroad: Durban
Anti-U.S. sentiments, AIDS discussions, and classroom debates create memorable visit
When deciding whether or not to study abroad, my decision 
was simple. I had spoken with many other college graduates 
that had regretted never having done it, so I figured I would. 
When deciding where to go, my decision was simple again. 
There were many options, but I figured, why not go to Africa? 
It was somewhere I never saw myself going on vacation 
later in life, and being a black American, I wanted to know 
what it felt like to be in the place many dreamed about, but 
would never go to. I entered this situation in a very confident 
manner, but I was soon confronted with experiences that 
challenged me more than I ever thought I would be. I was 
taken out of my comfort zone from the moment I got to South 
Africa.
Durban reminds me a bit of the cities at home. The beaches 
are extremely beautiful and like nothing I have ever seen. 
Going to the beach after class is very popular, so I am 
about five shades darker from lying in the sun all day. The 
city center, on the other hand, is extremely congested and 
reminds me a bit of New York City. The downtown has 
enormous shops and outside vendors, but, partly because 
of the sheer volume of people, pickpocketing is extremely 
common. I have gotten into the habit of not carrying anything 
when I'm out in the center and putting my money and 
valuables in a money belt. There are some suburbs that 
are safe, but I have found that all houses, no matter what 
neighborhood, tend to have very high gates around them.
I have been taking classes that I thought would benefit me 
because I hadnt been able to take them at home, but I never 
realized how much at home I would actually feel in the South 
African classroom. In every one of my classes  English, 
marketing, anthropology, and political science  we discuss 
the United States. We never stop discussing it, and in some

situations it is all we discuss. The United States is looked at 
as a model and pioneer in many fields, and students here at 
the University of KwaZulu-Natal tend to be taught the "right, 
or American, way of doing something and how South Africa 
fits into that picture. It has actually left me in some slightly 
uncomfortable situations where I am called upon to speak for 
a nation of 350 million people, when in some cases my own 
opinions arent even firm.
The best part of my experience here has been getting to know 
the people. I love just talking to the students. I go to school 
with people from all over the world, and somehow, 21-yearold college students always have something in common, no 
matter where they are from. I have learned the most from 
students my own age. They have been more willing to provide 
me with full disclosure about their lives because they are less 
traditional than their parents and are willing to share the good 
and bad about their culture that others may try to hide.
I have, unfortunately, found out why South Africa, for many, 
has simply been known for violence and AIDS, and is now 
known for xenophobia as well. Somehow, in this past week, 
everyone has been rioting and protesting against something.
I have learned that some people have a lot of resentment 
toward the United States, despite the fact that it is idolized, 
and I have, unfortunately, been a target of some of these angry 
feelings.
Many here in Durban watch America on television. They see 
Beyonce and Laguna Beach and think that every city is like 
California and that Americans have more money than can be 
imagined and live in gorgeous condos. I have had to try to 
show people a more whole picture of what our country is like, 
that it has gated communities and ghettos, and even though
the dollar is expensive, not everyone has very many to spend. 
I have learned that rationality is relative, and it has been a 
struggle to separate myself from the situations I have been 
i put into and to try and look at them objectively.
It seems that in every class, the topic of AIDS comes up in 
some way or another, and even though it is a large problem 
here, a lot of the students dont seem to view it as such. When 
I asked some of my friends in the dorm if they get tested, they 
said no and shook their heads as if to say, "Would I ever do 
that? I explained that at my home, friends will sometimes go 
to get tested together, not necessarily because they're afraid, 
but just for good measure.
I have been here for a little more than three months, and 
my trip is almost over. So even though many of my friends 
have just started their experience, I am reflecting on mine 
as though it has ended. I have very mixed feelings about 
experiences in Durban. Dont get me wrong  I would not 
rather have gone to Australia, or Italy, or France, but that 
doesnt mean that its been all good. I have been welcomed 
with open arms by some people and rioted against by others.
I have had the time of my life one week and feared for my life 
when walking down the street in the next. Being in Durban 
has opened my eyes to a nation, although famous, that I 
didnt know much about. All I knew about South Africa before 
coming here was apartheid and AIDS. But since being here,
I have been able to truly see the toll these issues have taken 
on the people. As much as we all may look the same, we 
live in two completely different worlds. Its been a difficult 
experience, but I wouldnt trade it for anything in the world.

CD drop box
Kid Cudi and Flaggs new releases show clever individuality
New music and fresh artists are being churned out 
every day, but it's hard to know which songs are musthaves and which albums have made it big. These two 
musicians have released second tries onto the scene 
that might just be worth a listen  at least some of 
them, anyway.
Kid Cudi  Man on the Moon: The End of Day
Kid Cudi arrived out of nowhere in 2007 with the release 
of Day n Nite," a lonely anthem that received mass 
appeal due to its introverted lyrics and catchy beat. 
Finally, after two years of collaborating with famous 
hip-hop artists, Kid Cudi has delivered a full-length LP, 
now in stores, named Man on the Moon: The End of Day 
(MotM).
MotM is a concept album, or at least Kid Cudi wants the 
audience to see it as such. Interspersed within some 
tracks are pointless monologues that are reminiscent 
of a more serious Kanye West "Skit or Wu-Tang 
interjection. All they tend to do is break Up the songs 
tempo and rhythm, as the monologues add nothing 
conceptually to the lyrical content of the album. Every 
rapper seems to do these monologues during their 
first LP, but I think that instead of focusing on creating 
an artificial narrative throughout his album, Kid Cudi 
should have paid more attention to his songs.
Initially, MotM seems utterly lost in a conceptual 
nightmare that prevents the listener from making 
sense of the album. However, the album finally finds its 
place when Cudi Zone begins. The song is a perfect 
mix of uplifting music that brings Kid Cudi out of his 
depression, and throughout the rest of the album, the 
beats are mainly fresh and light-hearted. Afterward 
comes "Poke Her Face, a lewd mockery of Lady Gaga's 
"Poker Face. Rappers Common and Kanye West 
provide excellent raps on top of the catchy beat.
Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
American rapper Kid Cudi releases his debut album, 
featuring collaborations with stars like Kanye West.
Immediately following is "Pursuit of Happiness, 
perhaps Kid Cudi's magnum opus of the album if 
one ignores the older, but excellent, "Day 'n' Nite.
It deftly mixes the rappers binary personality  the 
playfulness of the public Kid Cudi and the downtrodden, 
introspective Kid Cudi. He sings: I'm on the pursuit of 
happiness and I know everything that shine aint always 
gonna be gold/Hey/Ill be fine once I get it, Ill be good.
Kid Cudis pursuit of happiness involves doing what he 
does best  striving for creating a noble way of going 
through life without hurting other people. While "Day n' 
Nite reveals an attention-seeking, shy person, "Pursuit 
of Happiness" bares the evolution of Kid Cudis thought 
process.
Initially; MotM seems to be a disastrous collection of 
disjointed motivations and goals, but at the end it all 
comes together to form a vague semblance of direction. 
Kid Cudis only problem is the vast expectations placed 
on him, as evidenced by the numerous collaborations 
with other artists for his first LP, Nevertheless, if he 
continues to make albums, he might finally complete his 
pursuit of happiness, and, maybe, well have some great 
Kid Cudi albums.
Ken Flagg  The End of Suffering
Carnegie Mellon alumnus Ken Flagg (CFA 98), will 
be releasing his sophomore album, titled The End of 
Suffering, on Nov. 3 with Eclectic Records. The End 
of Suffering is a very eclectic album, mixing several 
different styles of music to create an indie album that 
is vaguely reminiscent of a combination of the early 
version of Ted Leo and the band The Shins.
The lyrical theme that runs throughout the album is 
universal: love. After singing through the first half of 
Blinded, the track changes into a Sufjan Stevensesque instrumental; and with horns and woodwinds 
blasting, Flagg creates a cacophony of sound that 
elevates the acute listener onto another plane. Flagg 
continually adds layer upon layer of different sounds 
until the track reaches a quite good climactic finish.
When the Sun Sets in the Eastern Sky is a fantastic 
closer to the album: a mellow song juxtaposed with 
eerie lyrics. Flagg sings "as the flesh melts off our bones/ 
we will both be dead but not alone without much 
emphasis or noted distress. With a catchy beat and cool 
tone of voice, Flagg catches the listener off guard while 
listening to the lyrics.
Flaggs style indicates that his music will remain fresh 
for years to come, though in a couple of the songs, he 
fails to create a unique sound. The End Of Suffering is 
an album full of one-off gems, in some of which emotion 
is quite spectacularly displayed. Whether the true 
Ken Flagg is The Shins, Ted Leo, or Sufjan Stevens, it 
is quite easy to see a very bright future for him as he 
further hones his style and music.

On film soundtracks
Music comes to me as a mental picture or as a story, but rarely as 
sound; I hate describing songs in terms of genre or artist; and musical 
performances, for me, are much more about visual showmanship than 
audible resonance. So, it should come as no surprise that film scores 
and soundtracks are my musicai forte.
Ever since Zach Braff put together that music-heavy film Garden 
State, Ive loved film soundtracks. Garden State was the film that put 
The Shins on my radar. The movies claustrophobic traffic sequence 
backed by Dont Panic, made me love Coldplay  for better or 
worse. The music was like the film; it spoke to a generation. Maybe 
when the film played Simon and Garfunkels The Only Living Boy in 
New York, one realized that Garden State was trying a little too hard 
to bring The Graduate to a new audience, but it didnt matter.
Later in life, Ping Island/Lightning Strike Rescue Op by Mark 
Mothersbaugh was the song that got me into electronic music. 
Coming from Wes Andersons The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the 
song was not what one would expect for a daring rescue op, but when 
that song hit its stride, the film was so funny it was fierce. That song, 
along with the rest of the soundtrack, captured Andersons offbeat 
sense of humor perfectly. I wish the rest of his soundtracks had ended 
up half as good.
To me, this is all about Hollywoods gradual appreciation for the power 
of a film score. When Radioheads Johnny Greenwood got tapped for 
There Will Be Blood, I jumped a little, and when I saw Greenwoods 
score working its onscreen magic, I leaped for the rafters. His 
soundtrack carried that film for me in ways that Daniel Day Lewis 
acting never could. I was changed. So I cried a little when I heard 
about the Twilight soundtrack.
In the first Twilight film, I was more than a little hurt that Radioheads 
15 Steps was reserved for the end credits, but when Thom Yorke 
signed on to make music for the sequel, I teared up. Then I thought: 
Yorke, have you no sense of pride? Hopefully, the film wont butcher 
the soundtrack, and as much as I try to keep an open mind, Im more 
than a little nervous.
So, instead of ruminating over what looks bad, I want to end by talking 
about a film score that is bound to do well. Im talking about the score 
recorded by Karen 0 and the Kids for Where the Wild Things Are. The 
soundtrack is already streaming on the Wild Things website, and let 
me say, being a kid never sounded so good, if you dont already love 
the films director, Spike Jonze, go see Wild Things  I guarantee that 
it will be worth it.

Red, white, green, or black  tea is universal
Margaret Harris makes the perfect cup of tea, educates on the medicinal values of the beverage
Last Wednesday, a group of people gathered in the front of 
Margaret's Fine Imports in Squirrel Hill  young and old, 
male and female, tea connoisseurs, and newcomers to the art 
of brewing the world's second-most consumed beverage  to 
learn about tea from a master. At 7 p.m., Margaret Harris, the 
owner of the shop, stood behind the register, which served as 
a teacher's desk, in an apron bearing the phrase: Many have 
eaten here; few have died, and began class.
Harris own story is as unique and vivid as the tea that she 
sells. Harris left her homeland, Poland, in 1985, while it was 
still under Communist rule. In Poland, Harris had a medical 
degree and was a registered nurse, but since her arrival in 
North America, she has opened a number of craft, candle, 
and  most recently  tea stores. Harris has been in the 
tea business for seven years and has taught others about 
tea for three years. By the end of October, she plans to offer 
gourmet deli meats and cheeses in her store as well, with 
some products coming all the way from Hungary and Poland. 
Because of her history in medicine, Harris has an extensive 
knowledge about the health benefits of each tea, which she 
includes in her classes.
Types of tea
The lecture began with introductions, and everyone voiced 
their favorite type of tea. Preferences ranged from Earl Grey
 Harris' favorite  to chai, and Harris informational lecture 
mentioned them all.
There are four types of tea: white, green, oolong, and black. 
Green tea is made solely of tea leaves, and since tea has eight 
to 10 times more antioxidants than any other plant, green tea 
is extremely good for ones health. Green tea leaves undergo 
very little oxidation  the process that causes autumn leaves 
to turn dry and brittle after they have fallen. White tea is a 
form of green tea, but it is made up of. only the buds and 
first leaves of the plant. Oolong is a traditionally Chinese or 
Taiwanese tea, and there are many kinds of it with various 
levels of oxidation. Black tea is a common Western tea that 
undergoes the most oxidation among the types of tea.
A type of tea that doesnt contain parts of the tea plant is a
tisane. Tisane is an herbal tea that originates from both China 
and the Middle East. It can be made from dried flowers, like 
chamomile, or seeds and roots. Another type of herbal tea is 
rooibos tea, which is made from a red tea bush in Africa.
Making the perfect cup of tea
During class, Harris also outlined the steps in making a good 
cup of tea:
Step one involves choosing a tea leaf. Leaves are always 
better and more natural than the ground up contents of tea 
bags.
Step two concerns the tea water. Tap water or filtered water is 
fine for tea brewing, but distilled water is definitely not. Using 
distilled water will cause tea to taste flat.
Step three is about temperature. For regular tea, steep at 
210C, and for green tea, at 180-185C. All tisanes should be 
steeped in boiling water.
Step four is all about the timing. Black tea should be steeped 
for three to four minutes, while green tea should be steeped 
for only two.
Tracing the roots of tea
Harris also briefly described the history of tea. Most tea comes 
from the tea bush plant, or Camellia sinesis. One legend says 
that Emperor Shen Nung of China was resting in his garden 
one afternoon when a sudden gust of wind blew several 
leaves from a tree into a pot of hot water nearby. When the 
emperor drank the resulting mixture out of curiosity, he found 
that he enjoyed the drink.
Tea was first brought to England by the Portuguese, although 
the Dutch were also major distributors. Contrary to popular 
belief, tea did not become popular in England until the 18th 
century, when Queen Anne chose tea over beer for her 
breakfast  yes, downing a beer for breakfast was actually 
common back then. Another common misconception is
that high tea refers to the famous British tea served in the 
afternoon with delicious cakes and sweets. Actually, the 
correct name for this famous tea, understandably enough, 
is "afternoon tea, and it was invented by the Duchess of 
Bedford, who thought that the gap between lunch and dinner 
was unbearably long. High tea refers to the tea that workers 
would take with their dinner at the end of the day, at their 
high dinner table  as opposed to the low tea tables of that 
time.
A cup a day keeps the doctor away
Tea has a special importance in Harris life. I think I had my 
first cup of tea when I was one day old. It was probably fennel 
tea, which they give to babies to relieve colic, she revealed 
to her audience at the beginning of class. Tea has been 
scientifically proven to be an anti-bacterial substance and 
contains fluoride, so it is actually good for your teeth. Women 
who drink tea often have a higher bone density, and tea also 
speeds up the metabolic process: Oolong tea increases the 
speed of metabolism by 10 percent, so it actually helps people 
lose weight.
But aside from health benefits, Harris sees tea as a way 
of creating friendships and understanding other cultures. 
"Knowing tea helps you to know people," she told her class as 
she poured out samples at the end of class, including oolong 
and red tea brewed to perfection.
Through her class, Harris explained how tea influences many 
fields: geography, history, politics, medicine, and especially 
friendship. Her store, as well as her life, are testaments to this 
statement.

Zombieland wakes the dead
Ruben Fleischer's new flick proves to be anything but lifeless in the box office
In a post-zombielyptic world, who better to have taking 
names and kicking ass than a Twinkie-loving man, a neuroticto-the-core college student, a rebellious young woman, and 
her pre-teen sister? Anyone, you say? Well, probably, but they 
definitely wouldnt be as entertaining.
Zombieland is a hilarious film that stars three of the best 
young actors of the last few years, along with one grizzled 
movie veteran, creating a surprising combination that works 
well together. Leading man Jesse Eisenberg has received rave 
reviews for his roles as a neurotic and hopelessly awkward 
young adult in more than a few movies now. He both stars 
and narrates as the character Columbus and explains that 
he has survived because he follows a strict set of rules since 
the beginning of zombie-time-all-the-time on Earth. His rules 
include cardio, beware of bathrooms, don't be a hero, and 
check the back seat, all of which are hilariously displayed 
during the film.
Woody Harrelson, who admitted to initially being hesitant to 
join a zombie film with a first-time director (Ruben Fleischer), 
plays Tallahassee, the grizzled zombie killer who has made it 
his life goal to find the last remaining Twinkies on the planet. 
Harrelson is hick-tastically hilarious and unabashedly honest 
to anyone and everyone. Hes the perfect fit for his role.
Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin round out the cast as 
Wichita and Little Rock, sisters who act as con artists to help 
them survive in the world they've found themselves in. While 
it is clearly Eisenberg and Harrelson who steal the show, 
these two provide some great moments and act as strong 
characters in a film that hands out (non-zombie) speaking 
lines to very few people. Each actor has his or her fair share 
of witty one-liners and laughable moments. Not one of them 
burdens the others by dragging their feet  a solid quality for 
any film.
Our four heroes and heroines, named according to their 
intended destinations, travel across our great  well, not 
anymore  nation in search of various things. For Columbus, 
it's his parents; Tallahassee cant get enough of those 
Twinkies; and Wichita and Little Rock just want to be kids 
again at an amusement park. Along the way, we learn more 
about each characters past and how they got to where they 
are today. In addition, some wonderful antics ensue at gas 
stations, supermarkets, and mansions, where our lovable cast 
kills zombies, acts inappropriately, and  fingers crossed  
finds love, all in a nicely wrapped-up hour and a half.
Zombieland opened across the United States on Oct. 2, 
garnering $25 million in its opening weekend, and has not
lost any steam since  getting many people talking about its 
potential. The horror-comedy has even impressed critics, who 
are usually tough on zombie flicks. But it is clear that this one 
is different. Cary Darling of the Dallas Morning N^ws perhaps 
summed it up best: When it comes to genre filmmaking, 
Zombieland, a grisly comedy about yet another attack of the 
ravenous undead, does just about everything right," she said.
And she is right. Not once did this film feel forced, nor did it 
ever slow down. It was consistently suspenseful, hilarious, 
stupid (in a very good way), or surprising (also in a good 
way). The phrase, Never a dull moment," definitely applies. 
Zombieland was good because it borrowed just a little bit from 
all the best zombie flicks of the last 25 years and still retained 
a great sense of originality in its structure, characters, and 
storyline. Go see it for the following reasons: It is one of the 
best movie experiences you could hope to get nowadays; it 
has the absurdly entertaining zombie kills of the week; it 
shows four people bonding over the virtual ending of human 
life on Earth (how can that not be hilarious); and, above all 
else, it is a solid comedy film. Oh, and did I mention it has a 
surprise and absolutely hilarious cameo from one of the best 
comedic actors of all time? Yeah, go see it for that too.

A look into the life of Ella
Pittsburgh Public Theater beautifully embodies a jazz legend in Ella: The Musical!
Tina Fabrique brought down the house as the title character 
in Ella: The Musical!, the show currently playing at the 
Pittsburgh Public Theater. Fabrique's soaring vocal range 
and exquisite rendering of jazz songs  made standards by 
the late Ella Fitzgerald  left one wondering why the show 
wasnt titled Tina: The Musical!.
A production created by a native Pittsburgh Public Theater 
director, Rob Ruggiero, and Dyke Garrison, Ella is essentially 
a one-woman show, taking place during the rehearsal of a 
concert on the French Riviera late in the singer's career. On a 
stage empty save for a standing microphone, Fabrique spoke 
to the audience like they were all old friends, letting them in 
on the memories and emotions of the modest singer. Known 
as the good girl in the music business, the darker notes 
of Fitzgeralds life are highlighted in this production, which 
weaves the singers broken relationship with her son and 
rocky marriage with a fellow musician into the silky smooth 
renditions of songs like "The Man I Love, Night and Day, 
and Blue Skies.
"Blue Skies is reprised on several occasions in the musical, 
and as the context evolves, Fabrique transforms the lyrics into 
a bluesy lullaby, and then a joyful ditty with a vibrant scat. 
Fabrique carried the two-hour production effortlessly. It was 
only when she discreetly turned her back to the audience 
to gulp down water during instrumental breaks that the 
audience could realize that, in actuality, this was hard work.
A Broadway veteran, Fabrique joins the cast of Ella after 
performing in Ragtime, How to Succeed in Business Without 
Really Trying, and Harlem Song, among others. George
Caldwell, another Broadway veteran (The Full Monty) is both 
musical director and onstage pianist and conductor.
The ensemble also includes Rodney Harper on drums, Ron 
Haynes on trumpet, and Harold Dixon, who plays Ellas 
manager Norman Granz. Each musician doubles as a man
Courtesy of Margie Romero
Tina Fabrique astounds audiences with her extensive vocal 
range.
in Ellas life  bathed in the spotlight, he leans into his 
microphone, and delivers a line to melt or break Ellas heart
 before returning to his instrument. This playful dynamic 
between song and story keeps the plot alive, even when 
Ellas life takes a turn for the worse and the audience is left
wondering if she will be able to pick herself up and keep 
going. When she collapses on stage during her concert 
performance in France, weeping while her elegant sequined 
dress sparkles in the stage light, it is hard to untangle her 
personal sadness from her role as a stage performer, the very 
problem with which Fitzgerald struggled her entire career: 
where her music stops and her life begins. She is never able 
to completely love anything more than her career.
It is this ambition and drive coupled with loneliness and 
heartache that make Ella a sympathetic character, but an 
exasperating one at that. When she leaves her son at home 
with a nanny while she and her husband leave to pursue their 
independent musical projects, the audience is torn between 
wanting Ella's career to flourish and for her son to be wellcared for. Viewers would want to like the singer as much as 
they like her voice, but the productions revelation of Ellas 
true colors leaves her polished legacy a bit tarnished.
Ella: The Musical! will be playing at the Pittsburgh Public 
Theater through Nov. 1. Tickets can be purchased at the box 
office or by calling 412.316.1600. Upcoming plays include 
Lillian Heilman is The Little Foxes and Arthur Miller's The 
Prince.

Hollywood comes to Pittsburgh
Stars filming on the streets, TV shows set in the Burgh, and performers stopping for concerts
 by Meela DudleyAssistant Pillbox Editor
With the recent amount of unending media attention and 
popularity being thrown at Pittsburgh, Hollywood executives 
are finally discovering everything that this city has to offer.
Pittsburgh has it all: a thriving arts scene, triumphant sports 
teams, family-friendly neighborhoods, buzzing urban centers, 
and a rich history. Point blank, as far as cities go, Pittsburgh is 
pretty charming. However, while all of the amazing qualities 
of Pittsburgh have always been evident to the locals who have 
had the privilege of living here, it seems as if others around 
the world are only just starting to catch on.
Recently, Pittsburgh has been getting a lot of attention. 
Through constant coverage of the G20 Summit, people 
have unintentionally rediscovered the city. CNN reporter 
Jordan Valinsky phrases it well. "Ten years ago, you couldnt 
mention the words posh and Pittsburgh' in the same 
sentence without a collective laugh. Not anymore, he said. 
Activity within th Pittsburgh, art scene has been extremely 
conspicuous. Outside of the usual symphonies, cabarets,
and musicals that have become token attractions of this city, 
there has also been a recent flood of foreign artistic activity: 
Hollywood has discovered the Burgh.
This newfound media attention is spreading like the swine 
flu during first-year orientation week. It has extended within 
all artistic genres: music, film, performance, and even visual 
art. It seems as if a variety of intrigued artists want to see just 
what Pittsburgh has to offer them.
Pittsburgh has always boasted a pretty impressive visual 
arts scene. From world-renowned displays like those at The 
Andy Warhol Museum to one-of-a-kind contemporary exhibits 
like those of the Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh has always 
been a notable hub for the visual arts. But, according to the 
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, the call for artists" has never 
been as well-received as it is now.
In the music scene, more artists seem to be making 
Pittsburgh a usual stop on their various national tours. Popular 
mainstream artists like Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson, and 
Daughtry have all made Pittsburgh a destination for their 2009
fall tours. And while more unknown underground artists will 
always find a home here in the Burgh, this recent musical 
magnetism has only added to the torrent of attention that has 
been directed toward Pittsburgh.
Popular unconventional talents are also bringing their acts 
to Pittsburgh stages. Magic shows by David Copperfield, 
international orchestras, and blue-collar comedy acts have all 
found a home here in Pittsburgh. With over 30 active venues 
and theaters in the city alone, there is always some form of art 
to see or partake in.
"In the Pittsburgh art scene, said Alina Narvaez, a first-year 
in the BHA program, there is always something to do, even 
outside of the Carnegie Mellon bubble. Whether its a new 
exhibit at the Mattress Factory, a concert downtown, or a 
new installation at The Andy Warhol Museum, something is 
always happening.
The film industry has also found refuge in Pittsburgh. Just 
recently, Academy Award-winning actor Russell Crowe 
visited Pittsburgh to film scenes for his latest project, The
8 feature
pillbox 10.12.09

---------------------------------------------------

Next Three Days, at the Allegheny County Jail. In a screenplay 
written by Paul Haggis, Crowe plays a man whose life is 
turned upside down when his wife is accused of murder. So 
far, directors have named Pittsburgh the project's sole filming 
location. But this is not an acting debut for the city. Apart from 
being a popular film setting itself, many of the films which 
ostensibly take place in Washington, D.C., Memphis, Tenn., or 
New York City were actually filmed right here in Pittsburgh.
With its quaint suburbs and towering urban features, 
Pittsburgh truly is a directors dream. Pittsburgh has been 
featured in blockbuster films like Flashdance and Dawn of 
the Dead, along with more recent releases like Silence of 
the Lambs and Robert Downey Jr.s film Wonder Boys. As it 
goes, Pittsburgh has a rich cinematic history and has been a 
staple location in over 60 smash hits released in the past two 
decades.
Just recently, the Internet was abuzz when Pittsburghers 
discovered the recent arrival of actor Jake Gyllenhaal and 
actress Anne Hathway to the city. Pittsburgh has been named 
the shooting site of their newest project, Love and Other 
Drugs, a film about a young salesman trying to survive inthe cutthroat business of pharmaceuticals. Based on Jamie 
Reidys memoir Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman, 
the salesman, played by Gyllenhaal, struggles to hawk a male 
performance enhancement drug. The movie production is 
centered in Squirrel Hill.
Similarly, actor Denzel Washington and actress Rosario 
Dawson will also be visiting Pittsburgh to film for their newest 
project, Unstoppable. The film is about a raikoad company that 
frantically attempts to stop an unrestrained freight train full of 
combustible liquids and poisonous gases from destroying an 
entire city. It is rumored that producers have already begun' 
shooting scenes in the Strip District.
Pittsburgh has also made its mark in the world of broadcast 
television. The CBS show Three Rivers is a medical drama that 
takes place right here in Pittsburgh. The show is about the 
complex world of medical transplants, and the worlds most 
established fictional transplant hospital just happens to be set 
right here in Pittsburgh.
All of this publicity has inspired some positive advances in the 
citys dedication and attention to the arts. New theaters have
been opening up, arts-based program expenses have been 
increased, and museums have been experiencing a constant 
influx of new exhibits from various artists wishing to display 
their work. If anything, it is truly the people of Pittsburgh who 
have recognized the benefits reaped from having Hollywood in 
the 'Burgh.
In an attempt to.encourage these positive advances, groups 
like the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council have made it their goal 
td encourage artistic development in the city, and they aim to 
achieve this through a series of loan programs distributed to 
those businesses and corporations involved in the education 
and development of the professional arts.
While the rest of the nation, in light of the recent economy, 
has been forced to make sacrifices and cutbacks to their arts 
programs, Pittsburgh has been fortunate enough to be able to 
do the opposite. This is a city that has truly embraced the arts 
scene as one of its most beneficiary attractions. With all eyes 
on Pittsburgh, standing center stage, the city has only one 
thing to say: Hollywood, here we come!

Back to basics: Fall fashion brings tamer trends
Autumn is finally here: The leaves are slowly turning red, and 
you can feel a crisp wind when you step outside. Pittsburgh 
has a lot of rainy days, but this new, cool weather is a nice 
break from the citys hot and humid summers, and as the 
temperature drops, people are beginning to bring their 
sweaters and coats out of their closets, and everyone cant 
help but wonder about this fall's fashion trends. The economic 
recession has affected the fashion industry greatly, but many 
designers are trying to work with this downturn, and from this 
arises the more tamed fashion trend of this fall  simplicity is 
the way to go.
Neon colors
According to Elle magazine, the New York fashion week for 
fall/winter 2009-2010 featured plenty of neon colors, and it 
was a similar case in the Milan and Paris fashion weeks as 
well. With plenty of colorful options for this fall  ranging 
from reds, oranges, and violets, to indigo blues  there is a 
color for everyone. To really give an accent to your wardrobe, 
you can get a vibrantly colored coat in indigo blue or violet; 
or if you are feeling a little less daring, you can spice up your 
outfit with a pair of neon-colored shoes or a bright bag.
Chunky sweaters
While this falls hot color seems to be vibrant neon, what 
about texture? Texture is often missing from the palette of 
fashion trends in the colder months, but this year is different: 
Texture, in the form of chunky knits, is a-prevalent feature this 
fall. You can try to wear a chunky knit scarf or hat, or you can 
explore more with a knitted sweater or even a coat. Chunky 
sweaters are good investments because they can be a great 
fashion statement and keep you warm at the same time, 
especially during Pittsburghs snowy*winter.
White shirts
With the recession, there is an increased emphasis on the 
basics of fashion. Vogue stylist Stephanie LaCava chooses 
white shirts as one of the fall wardrobes staples in Vogue's
October issue. While white shirts sound trivial, the varieties 
are endless: cotton with stretch, fitted silhouettes, cuff to 
sleeve details, collar variations; but they work with every 
outfit, from under cardigans and jackets to over wide leg 
trousers or skinny jeans. LaCava picks Thomas Pink's RoseMarie shirt priced at $150 and available online at Thomaspink. 
com. If you want a more affordable variety of white shirts, 
try American Apparel  their oxford long-sleeved button-up 
shirts are $54.
Leather
Its no great secret that a simple leather jacket has become 
a widespread wardrobe staple over the last few winters, and 
this year is no exception. In fact, leather has been taken to 
a new level this year, and the New York, Milan, and Paris 
fashion weeks featured everything in leather: pants, skirts, 
shorts, coats, capes, vests, and even leggings. If you are brave 
enough to try the leather leggings, wear them under a large 
sweater with some suede booties. Biker leather jackets are 
also in this fall. If the biker jacket is too plain, try wearing a 
shorter, bolero-style leather jacket instead. According to Style, 
com, wearing a simple outfit with an emphasis on the bolero 
jacket works well for this season. If you want some edgy and 
trendy jackets, check out www.topshop.com, where famous 
British model Kate Moss has her line on sale.
Camel coats
If you are planning on buying a winter coat this year, get 
a camel or neutral-colored coat. These coats are timeless 
fashion pieces and they go with almost everything in your 
wardrobe. The neutral coat, especially in a camel color, is a 
lasting fall classic because it has so many possibilities. It looks 
good with any bottoms, from your everyday jeans to fancy 
skirts. You can also accentuate your coat with vibrant scarves 
and neon accessories.

You have a strange inclination that we are not alone in the universe.
Your dreams become increasingly vivid and disturbing.

from BestCrosswords.com
You awake in the night with visions of twisted, ruined cites imprinted in 
your mind.
Your mind bends and twists to explain the strange things you have seen 
in your dreams.
Your increasingly strange dream voyages now often culminate in images 
of unearthly ruins, the likes of which you have never seen before.
Further inspection of the ruined buildings and dilapidated structures of 
your nightmares reveals them to be non-Euclidean in nature. Everyone 
around you tells you this is impossible, but you remain convinced.
You approach the center of the city, and you see a massive, impossibly

possibly exist in this world.
You notice at the base of the monolith -two great doors that swing 
inward. Tentatively, you tap the first one and it swings open, revealing a

That is not dead which can eternal lie.
In strange aeons, even death may die.

Hilary Masters, an English professor in the creative writing department, 
signed copies of his two newly released books at the Carnegie Mellon 
bookstore last Tuesday. How the Indians Buried Their Dead, a book 
of short stories, and In Rooms of Memory, a book of essays, were 
published in September of this year.
