Skibos Have Good. Chance Against

(?) Quantity.
It was almost a victory for the Plaid 
last Saturday; so close in fact, that 
it was just too bad. After being com
pletely squelched by Pop Carlsons 
Golden Panthers, on Wednesday, 
both the team and students had built 
up hope for a victory over Penn State. 
Right now a Tartan victory would 
mean a new lease on life for the tot
tering Skibo cause.
Taken as it is, without criticism, 
the State game was the best of the 
season, and without doubt the home 
quints closest gesture to a victory. 
Held to a 18 to 5 score at the half, 
the battered Tartans staged a spectac
ular, heart-rending rally in the final, 
pulling up to within two points with 
four minutes to go. However, the 
Lions seemed equal to the task of 
holding the lead, for a whirlwind goal 
by Ultz Reilly, and a couple of fouls 
by Jacobson and Hamas salted down 
the old ball game with a 21 to 25 final 
score.
Faace Different Squad.
The Skibo quint faced a different 
State five than that which had op
posed the Pitt Panthers. Reilly, the 
lanky varsity center, was the only 
: man in the starting lineup against 
Pitt, who got into Saturdays fray. It 
was little Lou Jacobson, with his sen
sational corner shots, who clinched 
the game for the Lions. Looping in 
five beautiful, but exeremely difficult 
field goals from the unprotected cor
ner of the floor and on a parallel with 
the basket, he put the Lions away out 
in the front with an 18 to 5 score at 
the mid point. During that time the 
Tartans had been limited to a field 
goal by Crum and three fouls.
The second half found Carnegie 
playing a much more efficient defen
sive game, one which effectively stop
ped any such whirlwind scoring 
against which they had been power
less in the first half. In the Tartan 
Clan, Bond was without doubt the out
standing player.__Besides shouldering
the major share of the offensive with 
four neat field goals he played a bril
liant defensive. Captain White is al
so to be complimented on his performj 
ance. He played a heart-breaking de
fensive until the last minute when he 
was removed on fouls. Although not 
on the starting lineup, Crum did some 
hard work while he was in the fray.
As for the Pitt catastrophe, last 
Wednesday, it is rather useless to 
comment. Carlsons Panthers are 
without doubt as efficient and smooth 
working a unit as has ever graced the 
Tartan floor. It was clearly evident 
that the Skibo five played to the best

General Chairman Of

Committee for Annual 
Spring Carnival
j Beauty can be even found in silos, 
grain elevators and smokestacks. 
Such was the statement made by Carl 
Sandburg in his lecture at the Y. M. & 
j Y. W. H. A. the other evening.
I This Chicago. boy minstre^ of pur 
alleys and wheat patches outside our 
town, Homer of our sunsets and stock
yards, as Ben Hecht lias defined him, 
gave a very interesting evenings en
tertainment by reading his poems, se
lections from his Abraham Lincoln, 
and singing some of his songs from 
his latest, and what he considers, his 
best book, The American Song Bag.
Carl Sandburg has a charm all his 
own; he reads his poems in a voice 
of melodious rhythm, quite free from 
vehemence, simply used without that 
foreign touch of elocution. Ho has a 
complete command of different effects 
and the nicest possible feeling. His 
is a voice for quiet ironies rather than 
for noisy imbecilities, in short his voice 
is pre-eminently used with the expres
sion of sympathy. Long will we re
member this modern boy playing his 
guitar and singing those dear old bal
lads.
Sandburgs life is unusually interest
ing. He quit grammar school when 
he was 13 to drive a wagon in the Il
linois prairie blizzards. The next few 
years were spent working in stoclcAt the meeting of Student Council 
which was held last Tuesday evening, 
William J. Kunkel was elected Gen
eral Chairman of Carnegies 1928 Cam
pus Week. Kunkel, who will super
vise Carnegies foremost activity is a 
well known figure on the Campus, be
ing one of the most prominent men 
in activities at Carnegie. He is en
rolled as a Senior in Architecture and 
is a member of the Delta Upsilon 
social fraternity. Last year heserved 
as assistant Chairman of the 1927 
Campus Week, and also was the Ad
vertising Manager of the Thistle. He 
is a member of the Scarab, an Archi
tecture honorary and the Pi Delta 
Epsilon, honorary journalistic fra
ternity. He belongs to the Dragon 
Society, Senior activities honorary, is 
President of the Interfraternity Coun
cil, Prsident of the Technon Club and 
a member of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet.
As yet plans for Campus Week are 
still tentative as Kunkel has not yet 
appointed his assistant chairman, and 
the chairmen of the various com
mittees. The appointments and the 
final decision as to the date of the 
ninth spring frolic will be announced 
in the near future.
According to present plans, Campus 
Week will be a two day event with 
the Mardi Gras omitted. No other im
portant event of the previous Cairyms 
Weeks will be omitted and many new 
features will be included to make the i 
two days crowded with gayety.
! yards. His education was continued 
j at a college in Illinois where he won 
an oratorical prize. To finance his 
I college years, Sandburg worked durj ing t.he summer in the Kansas wheat 
fields.
; The writers past college life has 
been as varied as his pre-college life. 
He has washed dishes In Denver ho
tels, shoveled coal in Omaha, saw ac| tive service in 'the Spanish-American 
i war in Porto Rico and as a member of 
| the Sixth Illinois volunteer infantry. 
During the World war he represented 
j a newspaper syndicate in the Scandin
avian countries.
I He is a poet of the commonplace 
people and places, transforming them 
into a thoroughly communicable expe
rience through his insight and sym
pathy. Sentiment characterizes his 
poetry of American life. "Sandburg is 
the poet, to quote again Ben Hecht, 
he plays their dreams on a mouth or
gan, tells them their secrets on a gui
tar." There is a snarl and whine to 
j his poems, and he sometimes writes 
with his fists.
Again the educational program of 
the Y. Mi & Y. W. H. A. has brought 
a great man to Pittsburgh. This in
stitution is a valuable asset to the 
community, by the enthusiasm that it 
stirs up in those people who have an 
appreciation for men of letters.

Interest In Aviation Club 
May Lead To New Course
Interest in the Aviation Club of Car
negie has increased tremendously, as 
its present membership of thirtyseven indicates. This looks promis
ing when contrasted with the ten 
charter members of last month. In 
addition there is a respectable list of 
applicants. The club is not so anxious 
for a large membership as an interest
ed one. Practically the only qualifi
cations necessary are an interest in 
aviation and a willingness to aid in 
what appears to be the coming thing.
This evening the club1 is to be ad
dressed by Mr. Yahner, aviation editor 
of the Pittsburgh Press. He is wellversed in his subject, and is certain 
to be interesting. The society will 
have speakers' from time to time, such 
as managers of airports, mail piots, 
engineers, and other prominent men 
who are versed in the varied field of 
aeronautics.
It is hoped that sufficient interest 
will be developed to have a course in 
aviation offered by Carnegie. Several 
of the members are licensed air pilots, 
and in the absence 'of speakers open 
, forum will be held which will un
doubtedly be both constructive and 
interesting.
Information concerning the club 
may be procured by addressing Box

TRUE LOVE NUMBER OF 
PUPPET APPEARS FEB. 21
Young ladies and gentlemen, read 
intently. The True Love number of 
the Puppet will appear on this cam
pus Tuesday, February 21. Now this 
is the one chance that opportunity 
provides for each and every one of 
the students of Carnegie to obtain all 
of the latest low-down on love, life, 
literature, leap year, and companion
ate marriages. Futhermore, a beauti
ful cover has been designed by J. R. 
Graham, on which all of the tactics 
used by Puppet in its discourse on 
love are presented graphically. Now 
what more could the students of 
Carnegie wish ?
Is love grand? That and many 
more lovely questions will be dis
cussed, with much serious thought 
and preparation, on the editorial page. 
The Sage of Skibo will discourse 
on, and disgorge all of the latest dope 
on leap year and love. It will' even 
go so far as to give special articles 
for the girls a,bout the fraternity 
houses, and to also disclose all of the 
necessary information on the girls 
who are fortunate enough to be in 
the dorms..
Now every bit of this .valuable in
formation may be purchased for only 
twenty-five cents next Tuesday on our 
own campus. Never has any maga
zine opened its heart as wide, that the 
public might view love in its nudity, 
as the Puppet has done in this issue. 
Surely the students will appreciate 
this fact, and not begrudge the dollars 
worth of information which they will 
receive for their small expenditure.
Missoula, Mont.(IP)The Fron
tier, literary magazine of the Univer
sity of Montana has announced its in
tention of becoming an all-midwest 
and far-west literary production, ac
cepting copy from other than college 
students. It Is an effort on the part 
of the editors to create some such 
magazine as the Midland.
Walter Brown Rogers, a senior in 
the Drama department, College of 
Fine Arts, was chosen editor-in-chief 
of the New Literary Magazine at Car
negie, which is soon to become a real
ity, at a meeting last Wednesday in 
room 106, College of Fine Arts, of stu* 
dents Interested in the formation of 
the magazine. Walter Rogers lias 
proved his literary ability in past con
tributions to the Shilling, and his ex
ecutive ability by his work as chair
man of the Campus Week Vaudeville 
show last year. He is a member of 
Beta Theta Pi and of the Druids, hon
orary fraternity, and has been active 
In Student Council. He has been very 
interested in the project of a new 
magazine ever since the idea was first, 
suggested, giving a great deal of time 
to, the preliminary activities con
nected with it. He was at the head of 
the committee that definitely formu
lated the final plan and constitution 
of the new publication.
Walter Rogers, as editor, was given 
full authority to choose the staff for 
the magazine with the, exception of 
the managing editor, who was elected 
by secret ballot. The staff is to con
sist of an editor-in-chief a managing 
editor, and four associate editors, one 
representing each college. Abe Frank, 
a Sopliormore in the Architecture de
partment, a member of the circulation 
staff of the Carnegie Tartan, lias been 
chosen as managing editor. To date, 
only two of the associate editors.have 
been appointed: Margaret Russell,
Senior English Minor from Margaret 
Morrison, and Harold Jacobson, a 
Junior Drama student from the Col
lege of Fine Arts. Miss Russell is one 
of the outstanding literary figures of 
the college; she is a member of Alpha 
Chi Alpha, womens honorary journal
istic fraternity. She has done notable

Ticket Committee Headed by 
Jean M. Springer Popular 
Prices Prevail
Among the chief matters, of im
portance occupying the attention of 
Student Council at; its last meeting 
on February 7, was that of distribu
tion of tickets for plays In the Little 
Theater. After various plans for. .the 
handling of tickets were tried through
out the year, a solution was suggested 
that. Mr. Davis In the Y office give 
them out from 1:00 to 1:30 during 
the time plays are running. Although 
Student Council has been distributing 
tickets in its office for somo time, 
the tickets have unaccountably be
come fewer and fewer In number be
fore many demands were satisfied. 
Mr. Rogers, senior in the drama de
partment has been appointed to in
vestigate the reason why students aro 
not receiving more tickets and as to 
who is, handling them.
As a, final measure of insuring pro
per consideration of the handling of 
social affairs, Student Council has de
cided that budgets for such social 
events must be in to Mr. Seibort at 
least a week before the evont is to bo 
dlscussod at Council mooting. This 
proceodure will bo strictly adhered 
to so that any budgets for affairs un
der contemplation which are not 
handed in to the Council will cause 
the postponement of the affair.
Other business including financial 
statements of condition of Council 
and its subsidiary budget organiza
tions as of February 1, 1928. The 
checking account of Council was 
changed to Mellon National Bank.
Motions were made and accepted 
that three social event budget pro
posals be accepted. They Include bud
gets, for the Womens. Senior Ball, the 
Gambol of the Guilds and for the 1928 
Thistle.
The matter of hazing a plebe named 
by Mr. Wood on the recommendation 
of the Sophomore Committee was ap
proved. Old business under discus
sion included the suggestion and ap
proval of Mr. Kunkel " as Campus

NEXT BASKET BALL DANCE 
AFTER NOTRE DAME GAME
At the meeting of the Womens Se
nior Ball committee on February 7, a 
definite date for the collection of the 
first installment of the payment for 
the dance was decided. During the 
week of February 13 the senior wom
en will pay two dollars to members of 
the committee. It is essential that all 
the girls pay promptly in order to en
able the financial , committee, Dot 
Smith, Betty Calvin and Alice Mclnnis, to have a working basis for car
rying out the plans already completed 
for the ball. In addition to the money 
paid by the seniors, the profits made 
at the tea dance on February 2 will 
be used to make the ball come up to 
all expectations.
It has aready been determined that 
the ball will take place on March 9 
In the William Penn ballroom. The 
favors havb been chosen and pro
grams have been ordered. The next 
important question Is the selection of 
the orchestra, a matter which has oc
cupied Betty Hayes and Evelyn Offut, 
who are in charge of choosing the or
chestra, for some time but which, It 
is evident, will 'soon be settled.
: Scholarship Committee 
I Announce Honor Students
The committee on scholarships and 
prizes, having had a computation 
made of the scholastic work of all 
freshmen for the first semester of 
1927-28, has announced the students 
who have carried their work with dis
tinction, and constitute the freshman 
honor list.
Henry IC. Georgius leads the Engi
neering and Industries freshmen with 
an average of 5.76. Following him, all 
with an average of 5.00 or above are: 
Marvin Fox, Merle J. Frank, Henry
F. Heckroth, John E. Barnes, Jnines F. 
Bisset, Milton M. Leven and Foster
B. Stulen.
Among the Arts freshmen, Elmer A. 
I-undberg leads with an average of 
5.59. Willibald Ryshanek, Sterling B. 
Smeltzer, Evelina Palmer! and Ches
ter C. Williamson -follow with aver
ages of 5.00 or above.
Grace L. Borgerdlng and Ruth TI. 
Lieberman load Margaret Morrison 
with a 5.50 average, followed by Isa
bel Levin, Ruth S. Buckwalter and 
Tressa Petrick, all above 5.00.
The second dance of the series of 
basket ball dances will be held this 
Friday, February 17, in the Union. 
The orchestra chosen for this event is 
the Plaid Revelers, one of the most 
popular campus orchestras. This 
dance will start immediately after the 
Notre Dame-Carnegie game and will 
last until midnight. The price of ad
mission will be the same as last week, 
$1.25.
The opening basket ball dance was
a, great revival of the old tradition. 
The spirit shown at this dance Indi
cated that much effort will expended 
to retain this tradition. Co-operation 
on the part of the students by attend
ing these dances will greatly aid the 
committee In re-establishing the tra
dition of holding basket ball dances.
If the dance Friday evening Is a 
success, another dance will be held 
Tuesday evening from 9 t.o 12, In the 
Union, commemorating Washingtons 
birthday. The orchestra obtained for 
this occasion Is "Ralph Kruck and his 
Tartans. The price of admission will 
bo $1.25. Since this dance J on the 
eve of the PJtt-Carnegle game, this 
will give the basket ball followers am
ple opportunity for bringing their 
spirit for the game to a red heat.
Tonight at ten oclock marks the in
itiation of broadcasting from Carnegie 
Tech. The program will be broadcast 
through station KDKA of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing 
Company on a standard wave length 
of 316 meters or a 63 meter short 
wave. The program, which will he 
one hour in length, will be in the 
hands of Professor Robert B. Leighou, 
associate director of the Night School 
courses.
The underlying theme of tonight's 
program will be "Dear OLD Tech." 
This song is known \ wherever Car
negie is known and the school is Just
ly proud of it, as it is entirely a. Car
negie product. From the time that 
the program opens until it closes with 
the Alma Mater, Intensely enjoyable 
numbers will be given, a program 
which bids to be one of the very best 
from KDKA this year.
Broadcasting as far as Carnegie is 
concerned, is experimental. The stv 
cess of this concert as evidenced "by 
communications received from listeners-in will largely determine 
whether Carnegie will appoiir before 
the "mlko again in the near future. 
Therefore It. is urgently requested that 
all com.moiit on the program bo sent 
to station KDKA that it may bo 
known with what success it is being 
received.
The doors of the Music TIall will be 
thrown open at 9:30 to students ami

scholarships by means of having one 
benefit In which the co-operation of 
all organizations In the school is so
licited.
Oh! Kay," is an example of a mu
sical comedy that has a general ap
peal. It is pot prudish, but is not of
fensive, either., The following are 
some of the song hits: "Clap Your
Hands, "Someone To Watch Over 
Men and Maybe.
The success of this project is laid 
upon the shoulders of the undergrad
uate students but it must also be 
backed by the alumni. Although many ! 
of the alumni are not able to render 
personal assistance on committees, j 
they can be of grejit assistance In pur
chasing tickets when the ticket sale 
is launched. Everyone desiring tick
ets should do his best to attend to his 
exchangeable ticket immediately, as 
explained in the letters sent out.
The Carnegie co-eds are now hard 
at work seeking advertisements for 
the program of "Oh! Kay, the musi
cal comedy to be given Monday, Feb
ruary 20, at the Alvin Theater for the 
purpose of raising scholarship money. 
The Womens Organization has formed 
under the chairmanship of Margaret 
Wagely, president of the Sophomore 
Class of Margaret Morrison, an ex
tensive campaign. Any girl who 
would be interested In soliciting ads 
for the program is urged to get in 
touch with Margaret Wagely at Elm 
Hall or call Schenley 9199 in order 
to get the credentials necessary to 
solocit ads. A profitable commission 
will be offered for all ads.
Miriam Cupps, chairman of the cor
respondence committee has sent 3,000 
letters t the Carnegie Club within a 
30-mile radius of Pittsburgh and to 
faculty. Special letters have been 
sent to prospective patrons.
Jean S'pringer, Senior Painting and 
decorating student, has charge of the 
ticket sale which was launched last 
woek. An exchangeable student tick
et will be jo'ld. In order to insure every
one an equal chance of securing good 
seats.
"Oh! Kay, has beep listed as, one 
of the best and most amusing musi
cal comedies of the season having a 
reputation of being presented to the 
I largest possible audience. All local 
Iheater-goers are looking forward to 
this show which is headed by the ini
mitable Julia Sanderson and Franlc 
Crumlt. Opportunities accorded to 
them in Oh! Kay for fun dispens
ing and hilarity are as yet. to bo onjoyod by Pittsburgh's theater-going 
populace.
The music of the play Is by C.eorge

Allerton House in Chicago is Now
Designated as Intercollegiate Hotel
A nationwide effort to bring alumni mates, it,was believed, in making the
of colleges and universities into closer 
contact has brought the appointment 
or designation of hotels in all the prin
cipal cities of the country as centers 
of alumni activities, say'* officers of 
the Intercollegiate Alumni Extension 
Service, which is the operating head 
of this organization comprised of 
alumni secretaries and editors of col
lege publications of more than one 
hundred educational institutions who 
are participants.
The most recent selection of an
other hotel as an intercollegiate alum
ni mreting place by the Intercollegi
ate Alumni Extension Service was 
that of the Allerton House, Chicago, 
which is now designated as an inter
collegiate alumni hotel,
The aim of the extension service 
has been to promote the welfare of its
selection.
Full records and directories of all 
local alumni groups will be kept on 
file at the Allerton House and will be 
available to alumni residents of Chi
cago and those visiting here, it is an
nounced. Thus far there have been 
40 hotels in the.United States desig
nated as intercollegiate alumni head
quarters.
The alumni, organizations of the fol
lowing colleges and universities are 
participants in the Intercollegiate 
Alumni Hotel movement; Akron, Ala
bama, Amherst, Antioch, Bates, Be
loit, Bowdoin, Brown, Bryn Mawr, 
Bucknell, Buffalo, California, Carne
gie Institute, Case School,, Cliica'go, 
College of the City of New York, Col

rado, Columbia, Cornell, Cumberland, 
Emory, Elmira, Georgia, Georgetown 
(College, Goucher, Harvard, Illinois, InRecent newspaper articles and com
ments we have heard prompts us to 
bring to the attention of our World 
War Veteran Alumni the possibility 
of transfering their Adjusted Com
pensation to the Endowment Fund.
But perhaps better than any ex
planations on our part is he follow
ing letter from Charles Gibbs to Budj dy Overend:
February 7, 1928. '
I Mr. Clarence Overend,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Buddy:
.Prominent in The New York Herald 
Tribune recently were the following 
headlines: 154 ALUMNI MAKE
OVER THEIR WAR INSURANCE TO 
CORNELL and ALUMNI GIVE WAR 
BONUS TO COLUMBIA AND N. Y. U.
Cornell will get 5154,000, Columbia 
will get $200,00, and N. Y. U. will have 
$40,000 for further endowment.
These are all direct giftsthere is 
no three for one provision. Under the 
generous offer of the Carnegie Cor
poration we have the opportunity of 
multiplying our gifts to our school by 
three. The multiplier is more if we 
give cash now, but lets talk only of 
applying Adjusted Compensation Cer
tificates.
These come due just about 1946 and 
will be just in time to be multiplied 
by three in actual dollars available to 
the Carnegie Endowment. No one 
need worry if their certificate cornea 
due in 1947 or later. Our friend, John 
L. Porter, will take care of that I am 
sure and see that due credit is ob
tained.
The time for application closed on 
January 1, 1928, but bills are being 
presented to Congress to extend the 
time limit and heres hoping they go 
through. Anyway, there are lots of 
men holding certificates now, who, if 
they realized, would gladly transfer 
all or part of their certificates to the 
Endowment Fund. The sum of $400 
wduld bring $1,200 to the Endowment 
Fund and wipe out the average mans 
debt to Uncle Andy. No easier way 
can be found.
I hereby challenge every veteran 
Alumnus to fill out a transfer blank 
you have them, Buddyand I do if 
you dontand se$ if we cant equal 
or beat the Columbia record.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) CIIAS. W. GIBBS.
Radio Nite sure did bring the Mil

cording to a copy of the invitations 
sent out, were sorry we couldnt get 
out there to it.
Of course, the radio program wa3 
the feature between 9:00 and 10:00 
oclock (Central Time), but the rest 
of the evening was not to be idle. A 
full fledged bridge party, with prizes 
and everything,. and a buffet lunch 
were other features of the evening.
Of course, we have not yet heard 
of the success, of the party, but here 
is what some of the experts of the

tions:

YALE DAILY NEWS IS
HALF CENTURY OLD
The Yale Daily News lias warrant 
for its jubilation, its special anniver
sary number and the numerous 
blurbs from high places at the end 
of fifty years of campus reporting. 
For besides being the "oldest college 
daily the News is .easily one of the 
most distinctive college' newspapers of 
the time. It has not been afraid to do 
the unusual thing in college journal
ism of speaking out on the American 
campus, a place where narrow loyalty 
always advises and often forces, a 
policy of hush. The Yale Daily News 
does not step put of its way to be
come a crusader but does not dodge 
issues when they arise. Only the 
other day it sensibly .upheld the stu
dents who went to court in defense of 
publicity of striking neckwear work
ers, to the shame of the tongue-tied 
press of New Haven.
, In its make up and news policy the 
Yale News is distinctive. It has cliar.50 ' acter, which cannot be said for more
than a score of the hundred of col
lege papers. True there are. many 
critics who, if' editor, wouljl curb the 
insatiable lust for interviews that 
rages in every Yale heelers bosom, 
causing the paper to be burdened with 
the opinion of every visitor from, 
Johnny Wesmuller to Otto Kahn. In 
the history of college journalism the 
paper will not be remembered for this 
not, for the dubious glory of having 
been tlie first college newspaper to 
have a rotogravure section. The 
palms will be awarded, rather, for hav
ing syndicated to the college press, a 
series of articles on student life the 
world over. It will be remembered for 
its fearless editorial policy in the 
neckwear incident and the "hush 
hall incident of a few years ago, 
when it led a foray on the new Yale 
architecture that was being foisted on 
the campus unbeknown to students 
and teachers. If the present campaign 
for honors courses is successful there 
will be another honor for the News. 
It is . through the influence of sucli 
napers as the Yale Daily News that
DO YOU REALIZE
North New Jersey also planned a 
radio party for Carnegie Radio Nite. 
This one was held at the home of 
Charles Gibbs, that is, if the house 
held them all. Acordlng to the pro-, 
gram, other features of the evening 
were card playing, a buffet supper, and 
sliding downhill (if there was any 
snow left).

Professor Everett Warner of the 
department or Kine Arts has the "oneman show in the annual exhibition 
of the Associated Artists of Pitts
burgh, which opened last Tuesday in 
the  Carnegie Institute Galleries. 
Professor Warner exhibits twentynine canvasses, more than a third of 
which are subjects selected on the 
Carnegie Campus, or in the immediate 
vicinity.
The announcement of the awards 
was made last Thursday, February 3. 
The first, second, and third awards 
present three rather distinct types of 
art.
The first award was made to Nor
man MacGilvary for his picture 
"Circe. It is a picture of a girl about 
12 years old, demurely seated between 
two black cats. The background has 
been highly conventionalized and the 
entire picture is representative of the 
cultural aspect.
The second prize represents the de
cidedly primitime, being a landscape 
titled Turtle Creek Valley. Towards 
Pittsburgh by Kane. Kane is a house 
painter by profession, and his admis
sion into the recent international 
made quite a stir.
Another quite colorful landscape of 
the tempermental type won the third 
award. It is A Family Group, a tree 
vista by M. J. Vick.
There are six other awards that are 
offered, one of them being offered to a 
woman. This was given to Elizabeth 
E. Robb for her picture "Rose of 
Italy a marine study. It is made by 
the Farm'er School of Design for 
Women.
The Carnegie Institute award for 
the best group of oil paintings was 
given to William R. Schulgold.
Flowers a floral picture won the 
A. W. Smith, Jr., award for Sarah C. 
Wilson. This is offered for the finest 
floral subject.
The Art Society Award for the best 
portrait was given to Samuel Rosen
berg for a picture of'himself called 
The Artist.
The Camilla Robb Russell memorial 
award was given to Willard Perkins 
for his picture "A Street in Old Paris, 
and to William Wolfson for his Four
teenth Street in New York, was given 
the anonymous award for the best 
black and white subject.
A very interesting group in the 
sculpture room is that executed by 
Myrtle Altwater in soap. There are 
also fourteen other compositions in 
other materials. Lillian Guiver is 
represented by a small group of minia
tures.
The exhibition this year is not only 
larger but more varied in character. 
An unusually large number of flower 
pictures were accepted, and there are 
also several portraits.
The Gkllaries are open to the public 
until March 9.
Ar$ the sophomores becoming lazy 
or merely big-hearted? Such is the 
j question that many upper class men 
j are asking as scores of plebes coni tinue to parade upon^tlie campus sans 
dink, black tie qnd black sox. During 
the mid-year examinations the plebes 
cannot be blamed for wearing loud 
ties. It is rather disturbing to enter, 
say a Math exam, with a black tie. 
It reminds one too much of the ulti
mate outcome. The psychological ef
fect would very likely prove disas
trous to the plebe.
However, the mid-years are now a 
thing of the past and black ties should 
once more be donned by the freshmen. 
They cannot, be expected to wear reg
ulations if there is no one to see that 
they do. Tradition causes this job to 
fall upon the sophs, and a job once 
inherited should never be given up 
until finished.
True, plebe trials continue to be 
held regularly. But those unfortun
ates who come up to trial are usually 
the ones who have committed some
minor offense as forgetting matches 
or their bibles. The real-culprits, the 
ones entirely out of regulations are 
the ones the sophs should search out 
and punish accordingly.
The girls, too, are having things too 
much their own way. They are seen 
on the campus talking and walking 
with men. without their arm-bahds, 
and committing several other offenses.
It is about time the sophs do some
thing. Perhaps they are being held 
back by thoughts of that day in the 
spring when the plebes, with their 
thirty or so football men, will rush 
down upon them and attempt to tear 
them to shreds in vengeance for all 
the trouble they have caused them. 
One does not like to call the class of 
'30well, afraidbut something is 
wrong.
The campus makes an appeal to the 
sophomore class, its officers and es
pecially the chairman of its regula
tions committees to bear down and to 
uphold the traditions of the school. 
Come on sophs, lets see some action.

Cole Speaks In Union On 
Influence Of Fine Printing
A lecture on The Influence of Fine 
Printing was given in the Union on 
Thursday afternoon, February 9. 192S, 
by Mr. W. Arthur Cole, honorary 
president of the American Institute of 
Graphic Arts.
Professor Porter Garnet,,Master of 
Laboratory Press, who spoke of the 
importance of the American Institute 
of Graphic Arts in stimulating better 
printing in the United States, intro
duced the speaker.
Mr. Cole has had wide experience in 
the fields of printing and advertising. 
He spoke highly of achievements of 
the Laboratory Press and the depart
ment of printing at Carnegie He 
prophesied that the influence of in
stitutes similar to ours would soon af
fect great changes in various fields 
of printing in the direction of better 
quality and higher grade workman
ship.
Mr. Cole presented many illustra
tions from his own experiences in 
the advertising field showing that in
sistence upon artistic excellence is 
likely to be of increasing financial 
profit in addition to affording other 
satisfactions.
It was a very optimistic and en
thusiastic presentation of the possibil
ities in the printing business for the 
use of superior Intelligence and artis
tic taste. The lecture was well at
tended by students of the Department 
oi Printing, students of the Library 
at Carnegie, and a large number of

j against the 2,252 for the first semes-1 
[ ter. The number of new gtiidents 
coming to Carnegie in  February 
reached 82. The 27 hew Freshmen! 
who are entering now, compensate ex-; 
actly, as far as numbers are con
cerned, with the 27. casualties in last 
semesters freshman class. To date; 
the first year students ranks boast a 
total of 647, an increase of 22 over last 
week's figures, 325 of this number be

Students who do not, wish to remove 
their first semester deficiencies now, 
may take their re-exam Illations,,during 
the fall period which begins the week 
preceding the'first semester registra
tion. in September, 1928.
The Hpring re-examinations will bo

At the first Sophomore Seminar lec
ture of the second semester a very in: 
teresting illustrated lecture on Chlor
ine and sanitation was given by Mr. 
H. S. Hutton, of the Wallace & Tiernan Company,
Mr. Hutton's lecture consisted of a 
discussion of the properties, methods 
of commercial preparation, machines 
for handling, and the use of chlorine. 
In this 'discussion Mr. Hutton deI scribed the different methods of preI paring chlorine commercially,, the his
tory of its different forms in which he 
Included the first preparation of. liquid 
chlorine and how this product had 
been developed into its present day 
use. Some time was also spent in ex
plaining to the prospective engineers 
the reasons for the decline in use of 
chloride of lime for disinfecting pur
poses with a great raise in the amount 
of chlorine used for the same purpose.
' Some of the uses of chlorine dis
cussed by Mr. Hutlion, beside that of 
purification of drinking water systems, 
w,ere:' Purification of swimming pool 
water, disinfecting of sewage and dis
infecting of gasses or deordorization.
Other Interesting facts brought out 
by Mr. Hutton are that practically 75 
per' cent of the people of the United 
States drink water purified by chlor
ination, and that by reducing typhoid 
fever deaths by the chlorination of 
water, approixmately 20,000 lives a 
year are saved.
This. Seminar is a part of the re
quired curricula for the Sophomore 
class in Civil Engineering. Prominent 
engineers from the Pittsburgh give 
the lectures. to the students, and the 
faculty feels that this is quite a good 
method of imparting a wider lcnowl, edge of the civil enginneering field to 
. the newer students. After the first 
I five weekk of this semester, the semi. nar is to be conducted by the seniors

Exhibit Of German Brick 
Architecture Held Here
Students in the College of Fine Arts 
-will be interested to learn that last 
Friday, February 10, marked the date 
of the opening of a photographic exhi
bition ofBrick Architecture in 'Ger
many," both medieval and modern. 
This exhibition will be held until Feb
ruary 18 in the Beaux Arts Building, 
Stanwix street, opposite Joseph Horne 
Company, in Pittsburgh. The exhibi
tion Is free of charge.
The exhibition consists of over-500 
pictures which are divided into five 
groups. The groups consist of pic
tures of churches, of buildings for de
fense, public buildings, smaller public 
buildings, and modern buildings. The 
exhibition Is very interesting because 
the architecture of Germany is differ
ent from the architecture of Italy and 
France in craftsmanship and daring 
treatment.
This group of photographs of Ger
man architecture under the personal 
supervision of Dr. Edmund Schugler, of 
Berlin, who, for a number of years 
prior to the World War, had been a 
member of the German foreign office, 
and architectural adviser to the for6 eign secretary. Dr. Schueler was re
sponsible for the exihibit of American 
architecture, collected recently with 
theN assistance of Mr. Arthur Woltersdorf, Chicago architect, which is^now 
circulating in the leading cities of 
Germany. The German exihibit now 
In Pittsburgh was inspired by the suc
cess of the American collection in Ger
many. This exhibition will be shpwn 
in the leading cities of this country, 
after which it will find its home in the 
library of an American architectural 
school. This exhibition is offered in 
the larger cities through the co-opera
tion of the Common Brick Manufactur
ers' Association of America, and un
der the supervision o^the several dis
trict organizations of the association. 
The first showing of these photo
graphs was at the Art Institute in Chi
cago.
Carnegies fire fighting equipment 
has been increased by the addition of 
125 fire extinguishers. These^extinguishers are of the common, portable, 
soda-acid type which are operated by 
inverting the extinguisher. As a re
sult of a recommendation from the 
fire insurance bureau of the Carnegie 
Corporation these new extinguishers 
have been, installed, being placed 
chiefly in the shops of Ihe industries 
building where the danger of fire is 
greatest and at a few points where 
there is a possibility of fire.
The bureau of insurance of the Car
negie Corporation within the past few 
months conducted an invesigation of 
the school property to determine what 
might be done to further the preven
tion of fire and'to improve the fire 
fighting equipment of the school. Be
sides recommending the installation 
of the new fire extinguishers the re
port of the investigation to the Car
negie Corporation complimented the 
school on the completeness of the fire 
fighting equipment and spoke highly 
of the work that has been done to min
imize the danger from fire. 'The pres
ent equipment consists of numerous 
hose connectfons and fire extinguish
ers placed at points where there is a 
possible dangei*\from fire, and where 
the danger is extremely great as in 
the artstheatre an automatic sprink
ler system has been installed.
The location of the buildings of the 
school makes a general conflagration 
impossible and as each building is of 
fireproof construction the danger from 
fire is extremely localized, being 
chiefly in the shops and laboratories. 
*Tlie completeness of the fire fighting 
equipment at these points of danger, 
coupled with fireproof construction of 
the buildings, minimizes any fire haz
ard.
The question asked those inter
viewed this week was: What Do You 
Think About Plebe Regulations?'
A. W. Tarbell, Dean of Men: I feel 
that if we are to have them, they 
should be for a much shorter period 
of time and more thoroughly observ
ed.
Robert Bruce, Freshman in Painting 
and Decoration: "I think theyre uot 
so good. Id rather not have them beI cause they detract from the work of 
the school, and the school could do 
I without them. The bigger colleges in 
j the East are doing away with them,
I and we ought to do the same thing. 
In a way they subordinate the freslii man, but they are not of much good. 
j Joseph Patterson, Sophomore in 
j Music: I think theyre very good be
cause they make the Plebes feel in
ferior. They should be enforced 
more than they have been.
Lewis U .Davis, Sophomore in Met
allurgy: I think theyre all right if 
enforced. They stimulate school 
spirit, makes the Plebes think, and is 
a pleasant diversion from studies. 
They teach the Plebes their place, 
and gets them used to the idea that 
they cant do all that they want to 
do.
H. J. Isherwood, I. & E. Freshman: 
In one way theyre all right, because 
it breaks them in. Some Plebes after 
they graduate from high school prac
tically run wild. I think that  they 
ougTit to let Plebes wear their hats 
since it looks silly wearing the dinks 
off the campus. I think regulations 
ought to be enforced lor only one sem
ester.- The Sophs ought to put up for 
trial only those that violate the regu
lations.
E. tyl. OFlyn, Freshman in ArcliiI tecture: I think that regulations are 
all right. There is only one reason 
for them and that is to keep the fresh
man class together for their benefit, 
but otherwise theyre silly and child
ish.
| J. Fox, Senior in Home Economics:
| They would be all riglit if they were 
enforced. They are getting more lax 
I in the enforcement every year. Plebe 
regulations help the girls  to know 
each other, and as long as" the girls 
j have the right spirit about it, it should 
'do good.
Dr. Barto left yesterday for a week 
of high school visiting in Connellsville, Uniontown, Cumberland, Al
toona, Tyrone, Johnstown, Clearfield, 
DuBois, Punxsutawney, Saltaburg, Latrobe and Greensburg.

The first issue of the new magazine 
will appear as the Spring Issue. The 
magaziue is to be published four times 
a year, beginning with--.the 192S-1929 
school year.
Contributions for the magazine are 
solicited from the members of all col
leges and classes. They - should be 
sent to Walter Rogers, 5549 Forbes 
street, Pittsburgh. The magazine, in 
content, will consist of short stories, 
poetry and verse, plays, book reviews, 
and criticisms of literature, art and 
life. Technical articles also will make 
up a part of the contents. The variety 
and. scope of the material offers an 
opportunity for students in all four 
colleges to contribute to the magazine. 
Features that will interest artists, en
gineers, cooks, seamstresses, scien
tists and future executives will be in
cluded among the articles printed. 
That the magazine will, be representa
tive of the needs and desires of all 
four colleges is assumed by the pres
ence of an associate editor from each 
school on the editorial staff.
The announcement that Carnegie is 
to have a literary magazine has come 
after, more than a year of tentative 
plans, meetings which failed to pro
duce tangible results, and suggestions 
which bore no fruit. That there is a 
need for. such a magazine has long 
been felt. Especially since the Shill
ing and the Technical Journal are no 
longer in existence.
One of the most important decisions 
to be made about the new magazine Is 
Its name. The contest begun In a re

U. S. NAVAL POST-GRADUATES 
TO TAKE METALLURGY HERE
Arrangements are being made for 
two officers of the post-graduate school 
of the U. S. Naval Academy to take a 
course in metallurgy here next year. 
Two officers in 1923 took a similar 
course and were awarded the degree 
of Bachelor of Science in Metallurgi
cal Engineering. The head of the post
graduate school wrote of these officers 
as follows: The courses arranged for 
them were thoroughly satisfactory to 
the post-graduate school and the offi
cers themselves were enthusiastic of 
the treatment received and the facili
ties afforded at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. The men who will 
come next year are the first since 1923 
to be assigned to specialize in ord
nance metallurgy.
At the February 9th luncheou meet
ing of the industrial training section 
of the Pittsburgh Personnel Associa
tion, Director Jewett will be the chair
man and Mr. Beatty the secretary. 
The luncheon will be held at the Hotel

A COLLEGE BOOKSHELF
(By Intercollegiate Press)
The Garden of Eden has been 
"done again. This time the story is 
Eden by Murray Sheehan (E. P. 
Dutton & Co., $2). and it is rather 
refreshing after Adam and Eve 
which Professor Erskine so recently 
imposed NYTXX us.
Mr. Sheehan has had no desire to 
be smart, He has not attempted to 
reproduce in modern dress and langu
age a beautiful old legend. He simply 
lias drawn upon his kindly and hu
morous imagination and enlarged 
upon the story, making it more beauti
ful, if we may say so.
Eve in Eden is not the Eve of 
"Adam and Eve. Rather it is Lilllth 
who is the discordant note. 
For, as we learn, Lillith was not 
of God, nor .of His creation. She was 
a spirit loose in the universe and un
confined; young as a new-born babe, 
and full of evil ways as an old and 
ugly woman: all experience was hers, 
and all wisdom; yet she was avid of 
sensation and eager of the flesh. She 
was not of Gods hands nor His 
mind. Yet she sought the goodliest of 
His works, and knew, when she would, 
the thoughts of His thinking.
So we have Lillith as the cause of 
all trouble, Eve the admirable charac
ter, and Adam a somewhat mistaken 
but noble person.

I attended Michigan State College, 
taking subjects necessary to pa*s 
examinations for a commission in 
the United States Army.. At the 
time, I was a member of the Mich
igan National Guard. Before my 
college work was over, we were 
called on duty in the copper mines 
I of Northern Michigan. Here, 1 
served as first Lieutenant in charge 
of police work In Keweenaw 
County.
This duty lasted about a year. 
Upon my return a very close friend 
explained to me the exceptional 
. opportunitiesoffered^by the Kresge 
company. While this proposition 
was entirely out of my line of work 
it sounded so interesting that I 
decided to give it a trial.-
Starting as a stockman in the small 
store in Zanesville, Ohio, was quite 
a come down and many times 1 
felt that I had made a serious 
mistake. Now, looking back over 
my past twelve years with the 
Kresge Company, I can see how 
fortunate I was to have made the 
change. I have no regret to offer 
and I am positive that from U 
monetary standpoint I am way to 
the good. From a social or busi
ness standpoint the same thing 
is tru.
During the World War I was a 
Major of Field Artillery In the 
32nd Division, and I was offered a 
promotion to Lieutenant Colonel 
if 1 would remaio in Germany to 
assist in taking over the army prop
erty as the troops left for home. 
This I refused to do aa 1 was 
anxious to.get back to the Kresije 
Company and find my place in 4 
9tore again.

football Star Wins
AMONG the many college graduates who have won 
\ success with the S. S. Kresge Company is A. H. 
Ashley, former football star and four letter man of M. S. C.
Like other men who have found their lifes work with 
this organization, Ashley started in at the very bottom/ He 
was led, step by step, through the various positions in our 
stores until he was thoroughly acquainted with every 
branch of our business. Then he was given a store of 
his own to manage  a dignified, well-paying position 
which carries with it a share in the profits earned. '
We now have a few opportunities open for college men 
to do just what Ashley did-start at the bottom and 
work their way to the top. If you are interested in a 
future where hard work brings its own reward, write to 
our personnel department at once. We will gladly arrange 
a meeting with a graduate of your own college who has 
already won success with the Kresge organization.

Jasper, Tenn.March 23, 1927Lams & Bro. Co.Richmond, Va.Gentlemen:
I have always wanted to smoke a pipe. After several attempts I gave my taste up, for with each trial I 
got a blistered tongue.One evening, when looking over a certain outdoor magazine, I read that 
a certain fisherman could catch more fish when using Edgeworth, so I decided I would try his tobacco for I am no poor fisherman!The next day I tried to secure Edgeworth. The local country storekeeper did not have it, so I sent by a friend to the city for my first Edgeworth. Two 
things have happened: I still smoke Edgeworth, and the local storekeeper always has a supply.I catch fish and never get a bite 
from Edgeworth!Yours for keeps,H. V. Massey

At the W. A. A. Board meeting held 
last Wednesday, the point system pre 
viously submitted by the Point Com
mittee, was accepted with a few slight 
alterations. Hiking and life saving 
are to be considered as extra sports 
and are not to be classed as major or 
minor sports. As many as 50 extra 
points may be received for engaging 
in either of these two activities. A 
slight change was also made in anoth
er clause which now freads: No one
is allowed to play on more than one 
minor and two major teams, or the 
equivalent of such, in one year.
Among other matters taken up by 
the Boar'd, was the question 6f rifle 
recognition. It was decided that a 
committee be appointed to. investigate 
the matter and learn what is being 
done at other colleges in regard to 
this sport. The committee appointed 
is as follows: Florence Bright, Eve
lyn Goldenson, Irene LaLonde, and 
Dorothy Roy.
Carnegie,'s tankmen opened their 
season last Friday afternoon by ,droping meets to the Pitt varsity 58 to 8, 
and to the Pitt freshmen 4G to 10. 
The plebes continued their losing 
streak on Saturday when they were 
taken over by the University School 
of Cleveland.
The Pitt contests wore in the form 
of a duel meet being held at the same 
time in the Carnegie pool. A fair sized 
enthusiastic crowd witnessed the 
events. In the races, Pitt held a de
cided advantage but the diving was 
more closely contested. Tlvree men 
tied for second and third places and 
two extra dives were made by each 
of the three before a decision could 
be reached. The diving was especially 
pleasing to the spectators calling 
forth time and again outbursts of ap
plause. Beecji, the diminutive plebe 
diver, gave a neat exhibition which 
evoked much praise.
Despite the score, the Tartan show
ing was not worthy of censure. This 
was their first^meet of the season and, 
for many of the boys, it was their first 
entry into fast competition. Let it 
suffice to say they fought hard, con-^ 
testing every point. Pitt, undeniably, 
has a team that is strong and expe
rienced. Prior to this meet, they had 
been on an'eastern trip where they 
defeated several of the larger col
leges including West Point. The re
turn meet, when Tech lias had more 
opposition, should be decidedly closer.
The plebes defeat on Saturday, 45 
to 14, was not quite expected as Tech 
had been rated nearly an even break. 
Here, again, the diving was. close 
with Rysbanck and Laundon tied for 
second and third places, while Beech, 
running true to Fridays form, cap
tured Hri
There have been no varsity meets 
scheduled for this week. The var
sity's next encounter will be on Sat
urday, the 25th, with Wooster,' in the 
local pool. The plebeB have a meet 
pending with Peabody High, for Sat

The intra-mu'ral basket ball season got under way last Monday, and 
already some upsets have been recorded. Of these, the most startling was 
the 17-6 setback which the Kappa Sigs received at the hands of the S. A.

their league title, but lack of practice, together with a surprisingly good op

The operation was entirely successful and recovery has been so rapid that 
hospital attendants report that Doc will be permitted to return to his home 
tomorrow. If lie-continues convalescing at his present rate, lie will no doubt leave for the coast in about two weeks.*******
The intra-mural basket ball games scheduled for next Monday will prob
ably be called off on account of the benefit theater performance that evening, at the Alvin theater.

BRASENOSE BEER IS
FAMOUS IN RHYME
Retirement of College Brewer Spurs 
Historians
London.  The ale brewed at 
Queens College, Oxford, has over
flowed into the papers of late in con
sequence of the retirement of the 
brewer; but the Queens is by no 
means the only Oxford College famous 
IJnr its ale, Jesus College used also to 
put in a claim, as is attested in the 
familiar Oxford Limerick:
There is a tall freshman o^ Jesus 
Whose looks are sufficient to freeze 
us;
In his boots he wears nails,
And his home is in Wales 
And he lives on the strong beer of 
Jesus.
Most famous of all the Oxford ales, 
however, is that of Brasenose. There 
is a book about it, printed for private 
circulation by Vincent of Oxford, in 
1857, now'lying on the editorial table. 
Its introduction explains its purport.
A series of poems is here present
ed on a theme abundantly familiar to 
all members of B. N. C.; for whom 
alone, in all probability, the following 
pages will possess any interest. To 
tliefn it may seem almost superfluous 
to mention that the Butler of the Col
legeis bound by immemorial custom 
to produce in Hall annually o;i Shrove 
Tuesday a copy of Verses in praise of 
the College Ale; accompying which 
a special brew is made for the day 
and supplied ad libitum to every in
mate of the College.
The Butler Tells 
Butlers, however,' are not chosen 
primarily; for their skill in composing 
poetry; so we are not surprised to 
find the introduction continuing:
The Butler finds it incumbent on 
him to state that though personally 
Responsible for the production of the 
panegyric, his acknowledgments are 
due to the Junior members of the 
College, from some of whom he has 
never failed, on his request, to ob
tain a lcirnl supply. This species of 
literary complicity .is believed to have 
been alwkys an understood arrange
ment; and may be traced by living 
tradition as far back as the time 
when the office of Butler was filled 
by a brother of Dr. Barker, formerly 
Principal of the College.
In an effort to interest the average 
business man in Economics the Pol
lack Foundation has been putting out 
several books of late, all of which are 
so written as to be worthy of reading 
by everyone, economically inclined or 
otherwise.
But by far .the most unique of these 
editions is the latest The Road to 
Plenty, by Professor Foster and Mr. 
Catchings. The. former, it is our be-, 
lief, wrote the book, the latter had 
much to do with paying the expenses.
No matter. The entire book is in 
conversational style. The scene is 
laid in the Pulman car smoker going 
from Boston to Chicago. The various 
types of men who enter and take part 
in the conversation, which a bit of 
unnaturally (of course) tends toward 
the unemployment problem, give the 
various viewpoints and arguments 
which are to be advanced.
There is the Self Made Man, the 
Bond Salesman, the Bishop. These 
three leave early after having contri
buted nothing. Then there are the 
lawyer and the business man and the 
professor, the labor organizer and tile 
typical salesman, and the brakeman.
Each lias his own point of view. 
And strangely enough, since the book 
was written by the professor of eco
nomics that Mr. Foster is, it is the 
business man ho has the right ideaaccording to Foster.
We had a feeling -in reading the 
book that perhaps Mr. .Foster was not 
exactly fair to all of the classes repre
sented. We dislike to believe that 
the average economics professor is 
as snobbish as he of the pulman 
smoker. But we enjoyed the little 
slam made by one of the party when 
he commented, "Economics professor 
write books-to be read only-by other 
economics professors.
However, after several hundred 
miles of travel and several hours of 
bickering, the men come around some
what to the business mans point of 
viewa point of view which we shall 
let you discover-for yourself, for you 
should read the book.
ing fourth place. With a number of 
last years good shots on the team, as 
well as some splendid new material, 
the Carnegie team should be able to 
make an \even better showing this 
year.
University of California.The days 
of forty-nine are recalled when one 
thinks of the Alexander F. Morrison 
Library collection, recently added to 
the University of California library. 
It contains books on California history 
depicting California and San Francisco 
in 1S45, before the gold rush when 
half a dozen shacks, a road, and Tele
graph Hill marked what was destined 
later to be a metropolis.
Books of travel, history, Irish and 
Scottish legend, and national tradition 
are included in the gift. Quaint old 
poetry collections of authors never 
commonly heard of, and much of the 
older fiction are found here.
Brown University.The men stu
dents of Brown University which for 
many years was not a Co-educational 
institution, have finally decided to rec
ognize the college for women in the 
university. The university paper, run 
by the men of course, printed an ar
ticle signed by the majority of the 
men in which it requested the name, 
"Womens College in Brown Univer, 
sity," be changed to Pembroke Col
lege of Brown University.
This marks the doing away with a 
tradition almost as old as the univer
sity itself.
New Haven, Conn.(IP)His train
ing in running the mile was of use to 
George B. Berger, Jr., a senior at 
Yale college recently, when he chased 
and captured a local College Crook 
who for months had been making way 
with campus fur coats.
Berger and Horton Spltzer were 
seated in the Delta Kappa Epsilon 
house on York street, when they 
heard a noise in an adjoining room. 
Upon investigation they discovered 
the cause to be Vincent Bowdon, 
known to police as The College 
Crook, in the act of climbing in a 
window.
Seeing that he was discovered Bow
don beat a hasty retreat, but Bergers 
training on the cinder track proved 
him the better man, and after several 
blocks, during which Bowdon once 
nearly knocked him down, he succeed
ed in. bringing the offender to the 
police.
Vienna(IP)Vienna university
students who object to her appearing 
here have been the cause for throw
ing a police \guard about Josephine 
Baker, American Negro dancer, who 
is appearing here.
Students assembled in front of the 
hotel to which she had been escorted, 
but were kept from doing damage by 
police. At the theater they threw tear 
bombs which caused several women 
to faint. Twelve of them were then 
arrested, according to police head'quarters.
Ohio University.  Dr. Frank D. 
Bachman, a former professor at Ohio 
University delivered himself of the 
following at a recent assembly:

M.VIEW OF THE LOVE NEST
By RING W. LARDNER
Ring W. Lard nor, has suffered as an 
artist, from tlio fact that his caroor 
us a writer has been inovitably linked 
with tho prizo ring, tho national sport, 
and tlio newspaper column.' Not that 
I disparage in any sense these note
worthy and amusing aspects of the 
vast and complicated American pan
orama, for each has its own particu
lar and not vapid distinction. But 
Lardners reputation was first made 
as a humorous writer on sporting 
events, and the public has been loathe 
to distinguish between Lardner the 
real craftsman and Lardner the jolly 
fellow extracting sheckles from the 
newspaper lords.
Years now since Lardner developed 
into a literary gentleman of distinc
tion, the public is still subject to eye
brow raising when his name is men
tioned in connection with the Ameri
can short-story and American litera
ture in general.
Strangely enough, Lardners reputa
tion now rests largely on his ability 
to portray vividly the lives and na
tures of these same people that for 
years he viewed as sport-craftsmen: 
the prizefighter, the ball-player. His 
first distinguished creation, the now 
almost fabulously famous Al, showed 
the effect of years of close study of 
sport types, of yoars of study of hu
man nature in all its phases. But his 
reputation now rosts on a broader 
ground, for there aro dozens of othor 
folk, real folk, of tho soil or of tho gut
ter or of tho loss restricted world now 
under his oyo. No longor is ho confinod, t.horo is rango, there ia tho same 
humor, there is artistry in detail, 
there is humanity.
Many people consider How To Write 
\Sliort Stories the first significant, vol
ume of his stories, tho volume which 
marks definitely the transition from 
reporter to artist. Yet certainly be
fore this volume there had been Al 
who paved the way for others of his 
gallery. Al may have been only a 
stepping stone; certainly he was an 
important one; without Al the now 
memorable and permanent portraits 
qf the Champion and the old couple
New York, N. Y.  So thoroughly j 
convinced 1b Thomas MacLaren, sec
ond Bush research scholar from Great 
Britain to the United States, that 
most scholastic failures in primary 
and high schools may be. avoided by 
specially arranged curricula, that ho 
has come to this country to discover 
what tho American educational sys
tem is doing for the individual stu
dent and hopes to win his Doctor of 
Philosophy degree at Glasgow Uni
versity with the thesis he will prepare 
on the results of his study.
Mr. MacLaren arrived in this coun
try recently tinder tho provisions of 
the scholarship established by Irving 
T. Bush, president of the Bush Ter
minal Company, and awarded by tho 
London Education Course in educa
tion. The scholarship enables a teach-1 
er of Great Britain to pass sOvoral ' 
months in America studying the 
school system. Its first incumbent 
was John Whitley of Oxford Univer
sity, who visited the United States 
last year and made an intensive sur
vey of vocational education.
Backward" Defined.
Mr. MacLaren emphasizes the point 
that when he refers to the "backward 
child ho means the child of. good gen
eral ability who is failing to measure 
up to tho standard in his studies 
which might well be expected of him.
"There can be no doubt that Amer
ican educators have been pioneers in 
coping with preventable backward
ness among students, Mr. MacLaren 
continued. "Most of the books I have 
studied on the subjebt have been' 
written by Americans. Americas 
financial resources for such study are 
far greater than ours.
"My chief interest is in what your 
schools have accomplished practically, 
rather than in the theories they hold. 
My view of tho subject is that practi
cal results aro of. first importance. 
This problem of backward children is 
so common that I wonder UT little has 
been done about it up to the present. 
Intensive Survey.
Mr. MacLaren believes that the 
practice of classifying children by a 
rigid system under which every child 
Is expected to study tho same things 
for the same period does not react to 
the greatest advantage of the child, 
lie believes that an intensive survey 
should bo conducted to determine tho 
needs "Of each individual child and 
that a curriculum should then be 
worked out to awaken its interest and 
co-operation and to strengthen its 
weak points.
"By adapting the curricula to meet 
the varying needs of pupils, a great 
deal of. preventable backwardness can 
bo eliminated, he declared.
Mr. MacLaren referred to the City 
of London Vacation Course, through 
which he obtained the scholarship, 
as an institution which "tends to in
crease international understanding 
and good fellowship.
Contacts With 22 Nations.
Its 10-day lecture courses in Au
gust aro attended by from 500 to 800 
students among which 22 nations 
wore roprosontod last yoar, he said. 
"Tho contacts which aro established 
during tho two-weok poriod must 
broaden and enrich tho students expprionco, and thoy cannot fail to car
ry back t.o their various communities 
and nations something of the outlook 
they have gained."
Mr. MacLarens own exporience in 
acquiring an education was intensely 
practical. Through tho snow and 
rain of rigorous XcoIT,mU,X winters, he 
trudged 11 miles each day to and 
from Ay;r Academy to acquire his 
high school oducation. From' 1905 to 
15)08 he studied at tho University of 
Glasgow, fnpm which he received 
"with special distinction the degree 
of Master of Arts. In 1914 ho re
ceived the degree of Bachelor of Sci
ence from the University of. Londpn. 
In 1919 he was appointed headmaster 
of Mearii8 School, Renfrewshire, a 
post ho still holds.Christian Science.

that is great in Lardner, the observor,

there is always the superficial coat

too, for the more exabting, superb

fiction in its sincerity, its pathos, its

nothing done to equal its power of

THISTLEDOWN
Cardo Chardon Disenwolle.
Thistledown can offer his readers 
this week an unparalleled scoop. This
tledown has had an interview with K.
N.
Wlio is K. S. N.? That, unfortun
ately, Thistledown cannot put down 
here. It was the sole condition at
tached to the interview, that Thistle
down, who interviewed her not as 
Thistledown but as himself, should 
not give away her identity. Yes, her 
Identity, for K. S. N. is a woman. The 
color of her hair, the hang of her
gown, the pictures that hang in her
apartment, the kind of piano she 
plays, the brand of tea she serves, all 
these Thistledown can tell you, but 
her name, never. One hint alone This
tledown will give. Her first name, 
her cognomen, is Katherine.
She had asked me to come to tea, 
at four, and since I was impecunious 
I had walked and got there early. I 
rang the bell, however, and the door, 
opened, and there she was. As we en
tered the living room I gazed in ad
miration at her. mauve gown. Slie 
paused by the table and fingered lov
ingly two or three books carelessly 
strewn ovor it. I saw. at a glance that 
they were by George Jean. "My fav

with an understanding smile. "I was 
just cutting the leaves of the new 
Mercury when you came in.

the barber in colloquial jargon i3 
doubly effective in carrying with it an 
almost visual portrait of the barber 
himself. Each of the characters, even 
the considerably minor one, is etched 
with such awful clearness against the 
drab, village life of the background 
that the small town seems the epitome 
of tragic comylacency itself.
Hardly a realist, Lardner is as im

and almost, I higlit say, Ruth Suckow.

"The Elizabethan setting was most 
illuminating, I replied dogmatically.
She titivated. "Oh, that, it was

green. One of my friends told me, 
"she went on shyly, that my review 
just made that performance. I be

lips moving reminiscently, "O ye im

Cowley, and Nathaniel Field is Isa

about such things, she said turning 
to me. "Such stuff is beneath criti
cism. To criticize it indicates a dis

sais quoi, of critical chic.
"I liked that Shakespeare show, I 
said loudly.
"As I have said, She continued, 
"you are a man. You use your head 
too much; you are stupid about such 
things. Now, take Close Harmony. 
Whoever the presumptuous person is 
who tries to make a funny column out 
of Thistledown, he criticized Miss Copas. How ridiculous! Is she-not one 
person in the drama school born for

right. Anybody knows that.
I murmured something about going. 
She went to the piano and sat down. 
"I am trying to write a musical com

began to hum, "Celt, crit, critical;

I am afraid that I made a very dry

"Remember, she called out as I

The League of Nations was born of 
the spirited yearning for a lasting

As usual, however, as memory lengthened and normal conditions returned, 
nations began to feed their urge for 
expansion, for the fulfillment of their 
"destiny, and all the common rot of 
the old-line nationalism. The League 
slowly lost the center of attention and 
degenerated into a debating society 
and pleasant week-end resort for dip
lomats.
What has the league accomplished 
in its short life? It has without 
doubt been the agency by which minor

Europe have been localized l>y the ap

There is no binding force, however, 
upon the depredations and the careless 
suicidal strategy of the old diplomacy.

force of the League as a poor imita

BOOK OF CONDUCT
RESTRICTED GIRLS
Recently there was found in the 
Harvard university archives a book 
of the rules of conduct for "young 
ladies of Mount Holyoke in the year 
1834 which shows that college in 
those days was a serious affair for 
women students.
One regulation forbade Mount Hol
yoke students reading the Atlantic 
Monthly, Shakespeare, Scott, Robinson 
Crusoo and "othor immoral works. A 
socond rule prohibited young women 
from associating with "gentlemen ac
quaintances unless they happened to 
be "returned missionaries or agents 
of benevolent societies. Added to 
those restrictions each woman student 
was expected to walk at least a mile 
every day unless prevented by "a 
freshet, earthquake or other calamity. 
iSome other rules were: "No young 
lady shall become a member of Mount 
Holyoke seminary who cannot kindle 
a fire, wash potatoes, repeat the multi
plication table and at least two-thirds 
of the shorter catechism.Michigan

Irrepressible admirals will sound 
the warning cry that the other nations

who will take up the hue and cry of'

the imaginary, suspected foe is cre

toes.
Meanwhile the League will sit. Pro
tocols, treaties, finely-worded pleas for 
arbitration will be presented by re

mats. For after all, the common 
masses at home are out of earshot of 
kll this. They know only of the 
threatening bombast and the silly paradings of the domestic chiefs, lately 
graduated from the automobile busi

held out for a growth of power and 
influence for the league is closely de
pendent upon the renovation of states

sincere desire for amity throughout

New Haven, Con.  A concession 
from the British Government to exca
vate a portion of the ancient city of 
Jerash, Palestine, has been received 
by Yale University, the excavations 
to be made with the co-operation of
the British .School of Archaeology, of 
which John W. Crowfoot is the direc
tor. The work is to begin in the 
spring, and will be superintended by 
J. Barbee Robertson, a graduate of the 
Yale Divinity School in 1926, who has 
been trained for this work under W.
F. Albright, director of the American 
School of Oriental Research.
The city of Jerash, known to the 
Greeks as Gerasa, is considered the 
most promising site for excavations 
to throw light on the period, A. D. 1-638 
in the development of the art and ar
chitecture of Oriental Hellenism and 
primitive Christianity. Realizing this,
i the Yale committee on archaeological 
The copy, plates x*esearcli in the Near East last year 
authorized Prof. Benjamin W. Bacon 
to obtain, if possible, the concession 
for excavation. Through the negitiations undertaken by professor Bacon 
with Drs. Albright and Crowfoot, a 
concession was obtained to excavate 
the Church of St. Theodore, built in 
496 A. D., the principal Christian mon-- 
ument of Jerash.
Links With Dura Exploration. 
Professor Bacon, in telling the his
tory of the city, and what the Yale ex
pedition hoped to accomplish, said: 
"The excavations at Gerasa will 
form a useful supplement to those 
Yale is undertaking at Dura on the 
Euphrates for the inauguration of 
which Professor Rostovzeff has just 
taken his departure. Dura was a fron
tier post of Hellenistic civilization at 
its point of contact with the East diying the period from Alexander to Con
stantine, but it appears to offer no 
Christian remains.
"Gerasa was the chief city of the 
Decapolis, or chain of Greek cities 
east of the Jordan in New Testament 
times, which had been founded by the 
Ptolomies and Seleucids to protect 
Palestine from the destructive in
roads of Arab nomads. It is men
tioned in the Gospels as the home of
the demoniac healed by Jesus in that 
region, and an outline of its history 
is given by Josephus.
Abandoned in 600 A. D.
"Like other cities, on the outskirts
 of the Roman Empire, it was aban! doned soon after 600 A. D., and since 
I that time has remained practically un
touched. The ruins are therefore 
largely intact, and furnished a spe
cially interesting field because of the 
largenumber of inscriptions, princi
pally Greek, but with a sprinkling of 
Latin, dating from 22 A. D. to the 
sixth century? and because the very 
extensive and ornate architectural re
mains show Graeco-Roman and early 
Christian developments standing side 
by side.
l"In assigning the concession for 
excavating the principal church in 
Gerasa to Yale the British authori
ties have had in mind the systematic 
and continuous excavation of the en
tire city. Naturally, ^the work must 
proceed from the latest strata toward 
the earlier. Underneath the ruins of 
the Christian period lie those of the 
Greek, and possibly still earlier 
Israelite a\id Canaanite remains.
"This seasons work, if done as it 
should be, should prepare the way for 
further restoration of the ancient city 
to the light of day in a succession of 
years of interesting exploration.
