CMU President Robert Mehrabian 
disputed a recent Pittsburgh Post-Ga
zette article which claimed certain CMU 
administrators were unhappy with his 
performance. The article [Stepping Out 
of CMU Post, 3/26] was written in the 
wake of GSIA Dean Robert Sullivans 
resignation. The article said, According 
to several sources, none of whom would 
speak for the record; Sullivan is not 
alone in his discontent. Others among 
the Universitys seven deans [referring 
to the deans of each college], say, are 
also at odds with Mehrabian....
Mehrabian said he was not aware of 
any dissension in the administration. 
Not except what I see in the papers, 
same as you do. I am not cognizant of 
what the issues are.... Youll have to ask 
the deans .... [Or] youll have to ask the 
writer.
He did say he felt the negative press 
could harm the University, and that did 
upset him. When articles like that come
out, Im concerned that it hurts the repu
tation of our University that everybodys 
worked so hard for, and that it doesnt do 
our University any good to start pub
lishing things with unnamed sources. 
As president of the University my job is 
to nurture and guide the University, 
and anything that is not productive for 
the University is not good.
Mehrabian showed concern that un
named sources were talking to the me
dia in the first place. I hope youre not 
going to make a big deal about it from 
unnamed sources. I cant fight rumors, 
and Im not going to deal with rumors. I 
can only deal with facts, he said.
Sullivan is out of the country and was 
unavailable for comment.
Administrators often have differences 
in working styles, Peter Stearns, the 
dean of the College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences said, Any time you drive 
closely down the same road you hit some 
bumps, and weve hit some of the same 
bumps .... There clearly was some ten
sion, at least as Sullivan perceived it; 
that is factual at least in terms of
Sullivans perception. I think there are 
points at which the president and deans 
have worked very successfully and at 
other points not quite as [successfully].
Susan Henry, the dean of the Mellon 
College of Science, said, I have had a 
very good relationship with [Mehrabian]. 
He has made available a number of 
resources for my college, and I certainly 
have a good working relationship with 
him.
As far as the situation involving 
Sullivan, she said, I dont have any 
particular insight into that situation.... 
You hear rumors about all kinds of stuff, 
and I dont think that those are the 
kinds of things you want to talk about in 
the paper.
The deans of the other colleges did not 
return telephone messages.
Mehrabian has a review of the first 
five years of his term coming up later 
this year, but the CMU Board of Trust-, 
ees has not yet determined how the 
review will be done. The Trustees will 
develop a plan for the review at their 
May 22 meeting, Mehrabian said.
Were ready to roll...

Tau Gamma accepted 
offer to move into the house 
J^erly occupied by Pi Lambda 
ti. Erik Witte, president of Sig 
ill said, The offer was made to 
e on the morning of March 17 
lring a meeting with Janine 
typola, Coordinator of Resi
de Life for Greek Affairs, and 
^ decision was made public later 
lat afternoon.
jhe house was available due to 
Lams eviction last February. 
le eviction followed the tragic 
!ath of a brother before Winter
Break. The brothers vacated the 
building during the mid-semes
ter break. A committee was 
formed to find a fraternity to move 
into the house. The committee 
met with Sig Tau on March 13. 
Coppola said that the committee 
was composed of herself, the 
president of the Greek Council, 
president of the Panhellenic 
Council, President of IFC, as well 
as members of other organiza
tions.
Chris Cenkener, president of 
the Greek Council, said that the 
main purpose of the committee 
was to explain to Sig Tau the 
responsibilities of living in a
house. Living in the house is a 
lot different from living in the 
dorms, so we wanted to make 
sure that Sig Tau had an under
standing of the differences, he 
said.
Witte said that Sig Tau pre
sented a 26-page proposal to the 
committee after it was offered 
the option to try to obtain the 
house. Our proposal contained 
all of our activities, charity pro
grams, and events, he said.
The proposal contained recom
mendations from other fraterni
ties. Witte said, The other fra
ternities were very supportive

For the first time, Spring Car
nival will be opening up on Thurs
day afternoon without the Uni

stead, The Force, 106.7 FM, will 
be starting off the weekend.
The Force will not be broad
casting; however, they will be 
playing music and giving away
promotional ---------------------
items for the 
first two and a 
half hours of 
Carnival. We 
were looking for 
something 
novel and dif
ferent to do to 
attract atten
tion as Midway 
started, which 
was always a 
problem for us,
said Jill Goodall, entertainment 
chair on the Carnival committee.
Steve Auterman, General Man
ager for WRCT, said, We were a 
little disappointed [by the new 
arrangements. They] were made 
prior to any contact we had with 
the Carnival committee. Goodall 
said, [WRCT] hadnt contacted 
the Carnival committee. We 
didnt hear from them until about
two or three weeks ago. 
Auterman said that traditionally, 
the committee and Student Af
fairs would contact WRCT. The 
main contact was Bonnie 
Gorman, who transferred out of 
Student Affairs last fall. This year 
no one contacted WRCT at the 
usual time, so the radio station 
then approached the committee. 
Auterman said that the commit
tee forgot to notify WRCT, and
We were a little disappointed [by 
the new arrangement They] were 
made prior to any contact we had 
with the Carnival Committee. 
 Steve Auterman, 
General Manager, WRCT
The Force was already booked.
Goodall said that The Force is 
charging the committee for la
bor, but she would not disclose 
the exact amount. Its a very 
small fraction, she said. A lot of have been made to see that this
Auterman said Everything that 
WRCT does for Carnival and for 
sweepstakes is voluntary. 
WRCT has been broadcasting on 
the Midway during Carnival for 
years. Auterman said that the 
first contract between WRCT and 
the committee was in April of 
1967. WRCT was actually paid 
for services to broadcast on the 
Midway, he said. It hasnt been 
like that for 15-20 years.
--------------- WRCT plans on
attempting to also 
play while The 
Force is on. Their 
goal is not to disrupt 
the show. Were go
ing to try not to in
terfere with them at 
all, Auterman said. 
If Carnival has a 
contract with them, 
and I believe they 
===== do, then well honor 
that. In the end, 
there will not be any serious re
percussions from this change of 
tradition. WRCT will take over 
after The Force is finished. 
Auterman said that precautions
the local bands are getting more 
money. This is not the case when 
the Universitys radio station is 
working. We dont get any pay 
directly from Carnival,
does not occur in the future: 
[The] chair has assured us that 
we are part of their list of plans of 
contacts for next year and the , 
following years, he said.

Now is the time for a change here at 
Carnegie Mellon. Change is never 
something easy to face or be a part of. 
My goals upon entering the office of 
President of the Student Body come in 
great quantity. Spirit, school pride, 
enthusiasm, and in general, a better 
CMU, are just a few of the themes I 
hope to carry out through my term as 
president.
I do not want to promise the world in 
this document, because that is unreal
istic. I will say that there will be some 
drastic changes made to this commu
nity. Changes for the better.
There is a lot that this campus can 
offer that is not taken advantage of by 
its students. There is also a lot that 
needs to be implemented/created that 
requires someone who is firm, cre
ative, and determined to carry it out. I 
have only been here for a short time,
As your Student Body President, I 
will utilize the position to focus on 
improving the quality of student life 
at Carnegie Mellon University. Ev
eryone who attends this University is 
cognizant of the low student satisfac
tion and Carnegie Mellons low reten
tion rate. The negativism coupled with 
a high-stress environment have caused 
a significant number of Carnegie 
Mellon students to become unhappy 
and depressed.
Given those issues, how do we deal 
with them? It is obvious that a pri
mary cause for low student satisfac
tion is the stressful work load de
manded of students.
However, it is precisely these de
mands which make Carnegie Mellon 
the successful institution that it is, 
and a major reason students decide to 
attend this university. So, given these

Americans detained 
for crossing into Iraq
NEW YORK, March 29 (DJ) Two 
Americans sentenced to eight years in 
an Iraqi jail appear to be haggard but 
in good health and insist they were in 
U.N.-marked territory when they were 
arrested, Cable News Network (CNN) 
reported.
CNN was permitted to visit the two 
Americans, David Daliberti, 41, of 
Jacksonville, Fla., and William 
Barloon, 39, of New Hampton, Iowa 
for a couple of hours in a small room in 
a prison in Baghdad.
The two men were arrested March
13 and sentenced March 25 to eight 
years in prison for entering Iraq with
out permission. CNN correspondent 
Brent Sadler visited them in the com
pany of Polish diplomats representing 
U.S. interests in Iraq, which has no 
diplomatic ties with the United States.
They seemed downcast, holloweyed, tired, and in a complete state of 
uncertainty about what was going to 
happen to them, Sadler said from 
Baghdad.
But overall, they appeared to be in 
good health, he said.
Daliberti, however, said he had suf
fered a heart seizure in Baghdad from 
the stress of the arrest a few days ago, 
and Barloon tried to notify prison 
guards for a couple hours before his 
colleague was treated.
Earlier in the week, the Senate ap
proved a resolution condemning Iraqs 
imprisonment of the Americans and 
urged President Clinton to take all 
appropriate action to assure their 
prompt release and safe exit from Iraq.
The senators did not elaborate on what 
kinds of actions  diplomatic, eco
nomic, or military  might be war
ranted.
The resolution, which passed 99-0, 
said the arrest of the two civilians 
after they entered Iraqi territory from 
Kuwait, worsens already strained 
relations between Iraq and the U.S.
U.S. officials have dismissed sug
gestions by Iraqi officials that the two 
Americans may have been spies or 
saboteurs as preposterous. The State 
Department has said that the Ameri
cans entry into Iraq was inadvertent 
and that the two committed no offense 
justifying imprisonment.
The sense of the Senate resolution 
is nonbinding and serves only to relay 
the lawmakers strong views on what 
direction they would like the Presi
dent to take in dealing with the Iraqi 
action.
The Senate strongly condemns the 
unjustified action taken by the gov
ernment of Iraq against American citi
zens ... and urges their immediate 
release from prison and their exit from 
Iraq, declared the resolution.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole of Kansas advised that 
Clinton riot shut down any options in 
dealing with Iraq and not back away 
from economic sanctions imposed on 
Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. Diplo
macy is certainly what we should start 
with, Dole told reporters questioning 
him about the Iraq situation. We have 
to make it very clear to Saddam 
Hussein we are going to stand firm.
Players union ends strike
NEW YORK, March 31 (DJ)  A fed
eral judge today granted an injunction 
aimed at ending the strike that has 
crippled Major League Baseball since 
last summer. U.S. District Judge Sonia 
Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunc
tion against baseball owners today, end
ing the 232-day strike. After a 90-minute 
hearing, Sotomayor granted the injunc
tion sought by the National Labor Rela
tions Board and ordered owners to re
store free-agent bidding, salary arbitra
tion, and the anti-collusion provisions of 
baseballs expired collective bargaining 
agreement.
The loss of playing time to the players 
cant be more than adequately compen
sated by monetary damages, Sotomayor 
said in an oral opinion that took 45 
minutes to read.
Owners, however, could continue the 
longest work stoppage in the history of 
U.S. sports by locking out the union 
before the season starts Sunday night. 
Management officials have said this 
week that the required 21 votes for a 
lockout dont appear to be attainable. 
The unions executive board voted unani
mously Wednesday to end the strike if 
Sotomayor issued the injunction, which 
was requested by the NLRB last Sun
day. It is now up to owners to accept the 
unions unconditional offer to return to 
work. I assume they will, union head 
Donald Fehr said as he walked out of the 
courtroom. No lock-out was .passed.
The replacement players were all re
leased on Saturday, before midnight. 
The regular season will begin after three 
weeks of spring training.
Clinton defends social programs
TALLAHASSEE, Florida, March 30 
(DJ)  President Clinton defended so
cial programs targeted by Republicans,
 recognizing police, college students, 
and former welfare mothers seated in 
the state House gallery to make his 
point.
Theres a right way and wrong way to 
cut government, he said.
Wrapping up a Southern swing aimed 
at bolstering his sagging political for
tunes in the region, the former Arkan
sas governor made his first address to a 
state legislature as President. He lost 
Florida in the 1992 election. I believe in 
shifting the power back to the states, 
Clinton told a bipartisan collection of 
Florida lawmakers, promoting efforts to 
allow states to craft their own welfare 
plans. Republicans argue that Clintons 
social programs are rife with waste.
Clinton criticized Republican plans 
that would sweep away dozens of wel
fare programs, cede federal antipoverty 
efforts to the states, and cut spending by 
$66 billion over five years.
It would deny cash assistance to sev
eral targeted groups: families on the 
rolls more than five years, mothers un
der age 18 and their children, and chil
dren born to women already on welfare.
I think its weak on work and tough 
on kids, Clinton said.
The federal school lunch program 
would be replaced by block grants to 
states, an idea Clinton said will hurt 
states whose populations outgrow the 
federal grants.
Dont ask, dont tell ruled unfair
NEW YORK, March 30 (DJ)  U.S. 
District Judge Eugene Nickerson ruled 
against the Clinton administrations 
controversial dont ask, dont tell policy 
on gays in the military, saying it was 
discriminatory and yiolated free speech 
rights.
Nickerson issued his ruling on a suit 
brought by six homosexual U.S. service 
members who challenged the policy, 
which calls for the honorable discharge 
of service members who go public with 
their homosexuality.
The policy of the act is not only inher
ently deceptive, it also offers powerful 
inducements to homosexuals to he, he 
said in a 39-page ruling issued in Brook
lyn federal court.
Prior to the ruling, lawyers for both 
sides indicated they expected the case to 
be appealed, possibly all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court.
Discharge proceedings are underway 
against three of the plaintiffs. All six
remain on active duty. Nickerson said 
that even if the government intended 
that the law prevent the commission of 
prohibited acts or appease heterosexual 
prejudices, it had failed to make its 
case.
A key government argument was that 
the presence of homosexuals would dam
age unit cohesion and undermine the 
militarys mission.
Even if defendants do believe that 
heterosexual service members will be so 
upset by a co-workers mere statement 
of homosexuality as not to work coopera
tively in the unit, such a belief does not 
justify a discriminatory policy, he said.
Twelve-year limit fails in Congress
WASHINGTON, March 30 (DJ)  A 
Republican-backed Constitutional 
Amendment to set a 12-year term limit 
on the future service of members of Con
gress failed in the House after falling 61 
votes short of the two-thirds majority 
needed for passage.
The 227-204 roll call last night capped 
a politically charged debate in which 
Speaker Newt Gingrich warned Demo
crats that the GOP will bring the issue 
back as its first priority in the next 
Congress if it retains control ofthe House.
The Contract may have been post
poned ... but it will be back, the speaker 
declared.
While Gingrich sought to shift the 
blame onto his opponents, the GOP lead
ership found itself on the defensive for 
failing to support stricter alternatives. 
On a 316-114 roll call, a majority of 
Republicans joined in killing a tighter, 
six-year limit that came closest to what 
grass-roots activists have won so far at 
the state level.
And on a 265164 roll call, the House 
rejected a measure that would have ex
plicitly allowed states to retain or adopt 
a stricter standard than the 12-year 
limit.
Also defeated was a retroactive alter
native, counting time already served in 
Congress, which Democrats had offered 
in a bit of mischief.
Rejected297-135, the proposal allowed 
up to 12 years of service in the House but 
threatened to take a fierce toll on the 
GOP hierarchy, many of whom have 
already served almost that long.
All of the options took the form of 
Constitutional Amendments that 
wouldnt become effective for years and 
then only if ratified at the state level.
The 12-year limit might have been 15 
or 16 years then as a practical matter for 
incumbents today. Rep. Barney Frank 
(D., Mass.) taunted the GOP for giving 
the term-limit movement ice in the win
ter and, he said, failing to meet the 
promise of its election platform.
Senator makes Presidential bid
WASHINGTON, March 31 (DJ) 
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, sound 
ing a ringing call for religious tolerant 
and a flat-tax system, formally launche 
his long-shot bid for the RepublicaJ 
Presidential nomination.
At a rally near the Washington Moni 
ment, the Senator signaled that, regard 
less of how well he does at the polls, 
will transmit one of the most unortho, 
dox messages in the Republican 1 
dential field. He firmly and explicitly 
called for preserving a womans right to 
choose an abortion and directly attackei 
the Republican Partys religious conser 
vatives for blurring the line betweei 
church and state.
Specter also devoted a significan 
chunk of his announcement speech t( 
advocating a switch to a flat income tax 
an idea that is gaining proponents acros 
the Republican Party. He proposes 
placing the current tax code with a sir 
20 percent flat rate on all business ant 
wage income.
Specter called the current incometax system bizarre, burdensome and hi 
ased against growth. A flat tax, he ar 
gued, would be simple, fair and progrowth, and would encourage savings 
by exempting interest, dividends, am 
capital gains.
Only two deductions would be allowed: 
one for as much as $100,000 of honif 
mortgages and one for charitable deduc 
tions. Family exemptions also would be 
granted to married couples and for chil 
dren under the plan.
Overall, the 65-year-old Specter de
scribed himself as the heir to the 
losophy of Barry Goldwater, the Repub
licans arch-conservative 1964 Presiden
tial candidate: I agree with Barry 
Goldwater when he said we need to keep 
the government out of our pocketbooks, 
off our backs, and out of our bedrooms.
Specters role as the sole champion of 
a womans right to abortion in the Re
publican field has changed with thf 
decision of California Gov. Pete Wilsoi 
to begin moving toward a candidacy, 
Specters stance as an advocate of 
womens rights is undercut by memories 
of the role he took in grilling Anita Hill 
the woman who accused Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual ha 
rassment during Thomas confirmation 
hearings.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  3 April 19953
University Center lacks name
Building planned to be named after major donor
By SAMEER KARIM
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Construction began on the 
new University Center early 
last semester. Though most of 
the funds for this project have 
been collected, $20 million is 
needed to finish. It is hoped 
that a single donor will make 
the remaining payment. The 
University Center will be 
named after this donor.
The center construction is on 
a tight schedule, with work be
ing planned on a weekly basis. 
Construction is running on 
schedule and this has been 
helped along by a surprisingly 
forgiving winter.
The last steel I-beam is 
planned to be set in early April 
by University President Rob
ert Mehrabian.
The center is hoped to be com
pleted before the start of the 
1996-97 academic year.
The usable space of the Uni
versity Center will be approxi
mately 2.5 times that of Skibo. 
There will be a gross area of
250.000 square feet, with
45.000 square feet left unfin
ished in the basement so that 
there will be space for future
expansion. There is alack of funds 
to finish this space at present.
The side of the center facing 
Warner Hall will have a series of 
columns and will have an inte
riorwalkway, vaguely resembling 
the internal walkway ofResnik. 
There will also be an entrance 
facing CFA. All of the entrances 
will meet in a large area that will 
act, in some ways, as a central 
area for the building.
The information desk will be 
located here and will act as a 
convergence area for all students. 
The center will contain two swim
ming pools  one for diving  
two small basketball courts, racquetball courts, a large area for 
Scotland Yard, a 450-seat audi
torium, and many other things 
that are presently scattered 
throughout the campus. Club of
fices will also be located in the 
University Center.
Clubs will have to apply for 
spaces, and approval for clubs 
will have to be renewed every few 
years. For those who do not gain 
offices, there will be storage space 
available; work can also be done 
out of these spaces. Skibo was 
torn down during the summer of 
94. The buildings four original 
posts were still standing when
students returned to campus 
in August. The reason for this 
was that the materials that 
Skibo was constructed of were 
being recycled as best they 
could. The building was com
pletely gone a few weeks later.
The frame of the University 
Center started to appeal* last 
semester. Slowly it has began 
to take shape and start to look 
like the pictures that have been 
displayed to the CMU commu
nity.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy says the 
former Navy Building, the Uni
versity Centers temporary re
placement, is serving the cam
pus community well.
The problem of where to place 
clubs during the interim be
tween the tearing down of 
Skibo and the opening of the 
new center was one problem 
that Mehrabian and Murphy 
had been considering for a long 
time.
Murphy said there is more 
office space in the Navy Build
ing than there was in Skibo. 
He also stated that more 
classes will be placed in the 
Navy Building after the new 
center is opened.

athletics, facilities upkeep, resi
dence life, and overall student 
satisfaction are going to be my 
primary areas of focus. Now that 
does not mean alternative or 
supplementary projects can be 
undertaken.
Something that has bothered 
me from the time that I have 
arrived here, until now, is the 
invisibleness of the Student 
Body President. I will support 
each and every student here upon 
entering the office, and hope to 
make Student Senate affairs, spe
cifically those handled by the 
president, more visible. During 
my term, I want ideas and sug
gestions to be brought to my at
tention. I want to help as many 
people as I possibly can. That is 
why I am campaigning for the 
office of the President of the Stu
dent Body. That is also the pur
pose of the office.
The president is a voice of the 
entire community. This is some
thing extremely important, and 
cannot be forgotten.

conflicting values for higher stu
dent satisfaction and top-notch 
graduates, how do we address 
this situation?
An important place I would like 
to start is attacking the problems 
which add to the stress. For ex
ample, inadequate advising in 
some departments, limited Ca
reer Center services, poor qual
ity in Health Services, and, of 
course, the disgusting food served 
by our very own Dining Services. 
These factors contribute to the 
daily frustrations which we 
should not have to deal with!
Within the position of Student 
Body President, I will use the 
background of my Policy and 
Management major to find work
able solutions to these issues and 
others. For example, students are 
often distracted byworries of find
ing a job after graduation.
I am currently trying to expand 
career services offered by the Uni
versity by assisting in the plan
ning for.a H&SS/MCS Career Fair 
as well as working with the ca
reer center and SDS students. In 
response to the issue of inad
equate academic advising, I will 
take a closer look at the feasibil
ity of appointing full time advi
sors for the departments which 
currently assign professors as ad
visors. Currently, many students 
are confused about the direction 
that they want their career to 
take. Given the diverse academic 
opportunities offered by CMU, 
and the various combinations 
that we can derive from these 
opportunities, every department 
should have an advisor who is 
able to fully devote his/her time 
to helping students work through 
their indecision and help them 
answer the question, What do I 
want to do with the rest of my 
life?
Why do I and others know so 
many people who have been in
correctly diagnosed by Health 
Services? I intend to place pres
sure on the administration to 
determine the problems and to 
find solutions.
There is no reason why we 
should tolerate the current poor 
quality of health services! Al
though the issue of low student 
satisfaction is not a simple prob
lem to solve, as president, I can 
help attack many of the smaller, 
more specific issues. Please take 
the time to write in my name 
when you vote for Student Body 
President.

throughout the process. They have al
ready offered to help us when we move 
fa. Sig Taus move into the house will 
mark the fraternitys second move since 
1986. From 1986 to 1993, Sig Tau lived 
in Doherty A Tower.
In 1993 they moved to buildings 102 
and 134 in Margaret Morrison. Building 
102 was a former sorority house which 
housed 16 people, and building 134 was 
a special interest house of 8 people. The
new house will have an occupancy of 32 
people. Michael Murphy, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, said that Sig Tau will fol
low the normal leasing arrangements 
given to all the fraternities.
This arrangement stipulates that all 
fraternities must agree to a leasing for
mat every three years, while signing a 
lease every year.
There are 12 houses in the quad which 
all house up to 32 brothers a piece. 
Murphy said that four of the houses
were built in the 1960s while the other 
eight houses were constructed in the 
1950s. The only difference is that the 
older houses have a basement while the 
newer houses have more space in the top 
floors. Witte expressed enthusiasm for 
Sig Taus new possibilities.
[There] is definitely a brighter fu
ture for Sig Tau because we will now be 
closer to the other fraternities. Cenkener 
added, This is [very] positive for the 
chapter.

RAs entitled to free 
housing, hourly salary
. Being a Resident Assistant (RA) 
at Carnegie Mellon is a full-time 
job and one that is important as it 
helps students adjust to college 
life. Because of the time and com
mitment that it takes to be an RA, 
i We feel that RAs should have their 
; rooms paid for by the University 
and receive hourly pay for the times 
that they are on duty and for train' ing sessions.
, Several colleges and universities 
; around the country compensate 
: their RAs by providing them with a 
free room. SUNY-Binghamton 
! gives RAs a free room and half 
board. Penn State pays for their 
rooms and gives them salaries. In 
; some schools, even positions lower 
' than an RA get their housing paid 
for, and a substantial salary.
Unfortunately, at CMU the RAis 
getting a room which is more ex
pensive than what they may want 
to pay for. This is true at CMU 
where RAs are placed in singles  
automatically raising their hous
ing costs.
As a result, RAs end up putting 
their salary directly back into 
CMUs and Residence Lifes pock
ets. In some cases, RAs wont see a 
cent from their paychecks and will 
still owe money for their room.
RAs also have responsibilities to 
Res. Life. They must arrive on cam
pus two weeks before classes start 
each fall. They are encouraged not 
to take other campus jobs. They 
must stay until the dorms close at 
the end of both semesters, and they 
must participate in training ses
sions that can last up to eight hours 
a day. They are also expected to 
maintain a minimum QPA. RAs 
are evaluated by their residents. 
They must meet with the differing 
levels of the Res. Life hierarchy on 
a regular basis. This is not the 
typical 9 to 5 campus job.
Res. Life and CMU need to start 
paying RAs back  they must be
gin to follow the models of other 
colleges and universities. RAs 
should not pay CMU to look after 
their dorms.
Carnival band choice 
reflects poor planning
. Who the hell is Yo La Tengo? 
may be the most common state
ment about Spring Carnival 1995.
' Spring Carnival has always been 
one of the few times students at 
this University can unwind and 
iave a good time. The headlining 
jand has always been a nationally 
mown group. In the past, Spring 
Carnival has hosted They Might 
3e Giants, Live, and Belly. This 
year, the big act will be Yo La 
Tango. This is a huge disappoint
ment. We deserve a popular band 
or Carnival this year.
Why have we gotten ourselves 
nto this situation? The organiza
tions responsible for booking bands 
iave offered excuses, but they are 
unacceptable. There is no excuse 
'or messing up Spring Carnival.
The organization lost its leader 
earlier in the year, but he was not 
the only person responsible for get;ing a big name band  there was 
an entire committee involved. A 
irst-year student, who has never 
attended Carnival, was then put in 
charge of lining up the main act. 
This choice seems strange to us  
low can a first-year student lead 
the hunt in finding bands for an 
event he has never experienced?
The committee also seems afraid 
of attracting a large number of 
people from off-campus to the con
cert. A really good band could cause 
students from local colleges and
high schools to flock to campus, 
creating additional parking and 
security problems. However, a band 
that would attract CMU students 
would attract other students as 
well. The only way to avoid crowds 
of people having a good time is to 
book an unknown band that no 
body will want to see. Unfortu
nately, that is exactly what the 
committee did.
Obviously, Yo La Tengo wont 
cost that much, so the committee 
has quite a bit of money left over. 
With the extra cash that was sup
posed to be used to get one great 
band for Carnival, there will be a 
concert series for the remainder of 
the semester. Where will this con
cert series be held? So far, the bands 
have been playing in Doherty Hall 
2315. This is an insult. The money 
should be going toward a good na
tional band instead of a bunch of 
Pittsburgh bands playing in a lec
ture hall.
The groups involved with getting 
a big-name act for Spring Carnival 
accepted a huge responsibility 
when they took on this job. They 
were responsible for getting a nationally-known band that Carnegie 
Mellon students would like to see 
perform on campus during Spring 
Carnival. However, they dropped 
theball. They disappointedthestudent body, and did not carry out 
their duties.
Editorial dissent
Spring Carnival has always been 
a big deal, because its one of the 
few things we can count on hap
pening every year. The main idea 
of Carnival has always been to 
have fun and to take the edge off of 
the tense life of Carnegie Mellon. 
When did having a large main
stream band pei'form become a 
necessity?
Last year we had Belly, an act 
that-was huge in the pop stream at 
the time. In 93, Live played. When 
Live played here, they had not re
leased Throwing Copper and they 
were an unknown band. The Spring 
Carnival bands have not always 
been celebrities; yet if some were 
to play today, we would pay for the 
chance to hear them.
Concert Chair Drew Ross death 
last semester caused an upheaval. 
After much searching for a new 
chair, freshman Doug Mosurak
took over with a different approach 
to the job. Rather than focusing on 
one large band at Carnival, he has 
been organizing weekly concerts 
in various locations.
It is absurd to say there is no 
excuse for there not to be a main
stream band at Carnival. It is 
equally absurd to demand that any 
of the high-calibre choices we bid 
for at the start of the semester take 
time out of their schedules to come 
to Pittsburgh and play for a group 
of college kids.
Instead of whining about not get
ting a band we see on MTV every 
day, maybe we should base our 
assessment on the quality of the 
music. Maybe then, we can enjoy 
the band, instead of bemoaning it.

CMU disregards 
student rights

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am writing concern
ing the Quality of Life 
survey addressed in 
your February 27,
1995, issue. This sur
vey has the pretense of 
a questionnaire asking if youre having 
fun yet? ... College is not supposed to be 
fun, it is work; otherwise, a degree 
would not mean so much. Therefore, I 
find questions concerning sleeping, eat
ing, and campus aesthetics inane and 
questions pertaining to suicide, depres
sion and discrimination important is
sues covered by Federal Law.
Concerning the suicide issue; CMU 
ranks second in the nation for campus 
suicides, yet weTank 24th academically. 
Schools in the top 10 do not seem to have 
this problem; therefore, I feel that aca
demic requirements of this school are 
not a stress factor with students. How
ever, an unsupportive administration 
may be.
The next issue I will address is the 
discrimination questions on this survey.
I am a non-traditional student who has 
returned to school after a 15-year career 
in the fields of science and art. Working 
in such male-dominated fields as aero
space and nuclear design, I have never 
seen the blatant disregard for civil rights 
as Ive seen on CMUs campus. Because 
Ive worked in these fields, I witnessed 
Affirmative Action offices rarely doing 
anything more than victimize the com
plainant after filing a discrimination 
complaint. So many feel to avoid such 
difficulties is the most effective response 
to these situations.
Unfortunately, I did not do so while 
attending CMU this year and subse
quently have dealt with the repercus
sions. Presently I have filed complaints 
with the Human Relations Board and 
the Board of Education for violations of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (I am 
legally disabled with the condition 
Chronic Fatigue; the school knew this 
upon my admission). I will not embellish 
issues of the case, but will state my 
allegations: refusal to provide me ac
commodations for my disability, and 
retaliation of administration and fac
ulty for having filed this complaint. 
Fortunately, I have friends and rela
tives who reminded me of my accom
plishments (i.e., educational waiver for 
officer placement in the U.S. Air Force, 
educational waiver for a tenured college 
instructor position at CCAC, self-employed nationally-renowned painter) and 
told me to seek other educational op
tions. I have been accepted by four uni
versities and art schools that far out
rank CMU in their graduate depart
ments. So if my complaints are unsuc
cessful with Federal Agencies, I will use 
the option to prosecute CMU in Civil 
Court, whfere other issues about this 
campus may also be brought up and still 
have a better deal educationally. There 
is much to learn from this experience, 
however; that is why I am writing. The 
first thing anyone should do is read ones 
rights as a student in the U.S.A.; some 
laws to review are: Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Edu
cational Amendments of 1972, Section
Letter to 
the Editor
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
and the Age Discrimination Act of1975. 
Discrimination and reverse discrimina
tion happen. Students should be aware 
of discrimination and how to negotiate a 
problem before it reaches the point of 
taking it to court, and if one must go to 
court, the knowledge of the law will 
avoid feelings of intimidation brought 
on by the defense. Also, most impor
tantly, believe in yourself; CMU is not 
the end of the world and by no means 
should cause anyone to acquire low self
esteem or serious depression.

Scotch n Soda 
aware of issues
Editor: =- g
This letter is meant 
to address concerns re
lated to Scotch n
Sodas recent produc
tion, Into the Woods.
Although the produc
tion was weeks ago, Scotch n Sodas 
board of directors would still like to 
address issues raised during the perfor
mances, especially related to seating, 
ticket sales, and handling the line.
Many questioned the way we designed 
the seating arrangement for Into the 
Woods. We do regret that for many, 
visibility was poor. Unfortunately, our 
organization was caught in a familiar 
dilemma. We realized that there would 
be a sizable interest in the show. In the 
interest of seating as many people as 
possible for a short run (only three per
formances), we designed the seating ar
rangements as seen. Unfortunately, 
while that seating arrangement has 
worked for us in the past, the fact that 
our stage was not raised did cause some 
visibility problems. We do regret any 
vision problems that prevented audi
ence members from fully enjoying what 
we considered a great show.
Also, some voiced concerns that tick
ets should have been pre-sold for Into 
the Woods. Here, we simply didnt an
ticipate the numbers that would try to 
attend the performances. While we did 
realize that the show was popular, we 
never imagined that we would be turn
ing away a total of over 300 people. 
Traditionally, our performances have 
trouble filling the house. Having rarely 
done a show with the draw of Into the 
Woods, we were not prepared for the 
interest it received. Again, we would 
like to apologize to those who stood in 
the long lines, some of whom were even
tually turned away. Unfortunately, 
there is only so much we can do to 
anticipate such a draw. We were under
staffed to more adequately handle the 
line. Performing in the Drill Deck and 
other factors have made this year an 
unpredictable one for Scotch n Soda in 
many ways. Therefore, we are continu
ally learning as we go. We would like to 
thank the Carnegie Mellon community 
for the outstanding response to the show, 
and ask all to consider that our organi
zation will certainly learn from each 
production.
We encourage the community to at
tend our Carnival production, Lucky
Stiff, and our final show of the season, 
Sun Country, a student-written work to 
be performed in late April or early May. 
We will continue to work to provide 
entertainment for the community and 
good experiences for our members, while 
also keeping the interest of the audience 
in mind.

Election process 
raises concern
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Sometimes the act 
fools everyone, the ac
tor included. Im at 
Scotland Yard, the sec
ond of the three ru
mored to exist. Num
ber Two here owes its existence in no 
small part to an alleged minor criminal 
and former Student Body President. He 
is of note, particularly because he was a 
fraud, too, although a crafty one. Only 
after .his election did his true nature 
reveal itself, and only then with time. 
He was put into office, really, by .default. 
But, honestly, who did he have to fool to 
win the election? An election is, lets face 
it, an unreal thing. People putting em. phatic marks in little square boxes o 
rectangular sheets of paper. No reason
able person imagines this activity could 
decide issues of genuine concern. Also, 
note the questions left unanswered in 
any campaign. Important issues, like 
.the nature of the candidate, or the nobil
ity of his heart, require too great i 
effort in a world lacking general agree
ment on what nobility of heart is. And, 
even with an exceptional spending of 
effort, he might have fooled us anyway.
I am not a cynic. A consideration of my 
own heart reveals, however, that when 
looking deep enough, the thing that 
stares back freezes my heart in a black 
ice. I believe in evil as well as good. Only 
the strongest civilization can hold back 
the beast. Let us simply accept that 
within our mind lies vestiges of the ani
mals we are so similar to. And that this 
animal part is very strong, capable of 
driving us to greatness or destruction. 
That strength must be held in respon
sible check. For with any strength comes 
the temptation to misuse the power it 
grants. Finally consider that most people 
cannot handle even trivial powers prop
erly, and now the stage is set for i 
tragedy to unfold. And one has been 
played out. It happened, and now I fear 
we have not learned from it. Too few 
people have considered the questions 
raised, and their votes will be drowned 
against the static of people too busy to 
think hard for once, and care for some
thing that will speak either ill or good ol 
them in times to come. The pessimism 
here ends. For the realist knows that 
was due to a certain mans understand
ing of power that I can sit in Scotland 
Yard. From a man hiding a petty evil 
was birthed a small good, and for thatl 
can be glad.

Rationalizations prevail over logic
Matt Ball
One of our most interesting 
quirks is the ability to see (hear, 
etc.) what we want. The ability to 
see things that are not there has 
been common for readers of this 
space. For example, when it was 
suggested here that parents re
search the relative risk and effi
cacy of vaccines, one reader ac
cused me of telling parents not to 
inoculate their children against 
any diseases. This reader went 
on to build a series of insults 
based on this not-even-half truth.
Encouraging people to think for 
themselves and base their beliefs 
and outlook on their own experi
ence instead of the traditions and 
superstitions of others has met 
with the fiercest criticisms and 
cursing. Extolling our ultimate
virtue  free will  has elicited 
the slander of bigotry and worse. 
As one who has always spoken 
against prejudice and for openminded understanding of and re
spect for the interests and rights 
of all, these accusations are ludi
crous and laughable.

that my actions affect fellow sen

though acting from the tradition
of might makes right is evolutionarily sound, this philosophy 
is subject to creating abuses that 
are not, and should not be, ac

If animals can feel pain as hu
mans can, and desire to live as 
humans do, how can they not be 
granted similar respect?
As moral beings, how can we 
justify our continued exploitation 
of them? We must stand up 
against the idea that might makes 
right.
We must question the status 
quo which allows the unques

what we are told.
If we dont, we abdicate our 
highest ability and potential, and 
we deny everything that is unique

Alleged suicide arouses suspicions
James Stepanek
Now as I recall, there was a huge scan
dal about a break-in which occurred about 
20 or so years ago. This crime led to a huge 
media eruption and the destruction of a 
president. This was Watergate. President 
Nixon or his aides, in an attempt to gain 
advantage over political foes, arranged to 
have a felony committed and followed this 
with a major cover-up. We seem to have 
the makings of another such incident wait
ing in the wings, and yet the major media 
really isnt running with the story very 
hard.
A man named Vincent W. Foster Jr. 
allegedly committed suicide in July ofl993. 
This man was a long-time associate of 
President Clinton in Arkansas and was a 
lawyer in the Rose Law firm, which Hillary 
Rodham Clinton was a partner in. It would 
appear that Foster had been involved in 
some of the Whitewater dealings. These 
are a series of questionable financial deal
ing which the Clintons were involved in 
during Bills governorship.
This suicide is surrounded by a string 
. of obtuse occurrences and improprietous 
actions by the administration. The sui, cide itself seems unlikely to actually be 
. one. A review by forensic experts shows
that the manner in which the gun, which 
was not known to be Fosters, was held in 
a position which was not only awkward, 
but almost capable of prohibiting firing. 
The powder bums on the hands of Mr. 
Foster show that the gun was held with 
the hands on both sides of the chamber, 
with no grip on the handle. If you can 
picture this you could easily get the image 
that Foster was trying to force the gun out
of his mouth rather than firing it ______
himself.
The location of the body has 
also been a matter of dispute. The 
body was originally found by a 
witness who is keeping his iden
tity to himself. He has since con
tacted the FBI and aided the in
vestigation, but he disavows the 
results of the preliminary find
ings of Special Prosecutor Fiske.
He claims that the report mis
quotes him repeatedly. The location where 
the body is said to have lain in the report 
does not jibe with the report of the man 
who found it. The new Special Prosecutor, 
Kenneth Starr, has re-opened the investi
gation.
This case was also handled in a rather 
odd fashion. The incident was reported as 
a suicide from the get go. This is not in any 
way a standard operating procedure. Usu
ally in a case of death, the incident is 
considered a homicide until at least some 
positive evidence to prove otherwise is 
found. Also, the investigation was left to
the park police. Somehow the fact that a 
close confidant of the President died in 
shady circumstances and he left the inves
tigation to the park police seems some
what troubling to me.
Now about the gun (of course a hobby of 
mine). Nobody in Fosters family recalls
The independent counsel charged with 
investigating the Whitewater Affair has 
begun further investigations into this 
alleged suicide and has subpoenaed the 
park police who investigated this inci
dent. In a very recent development, the 
interviewed officers invoked their Fifth

him purchasing it. Of course this may well the investigators. This means that they

tration. The suicide itself seems 
unlikely to actually to be one.
Washington D.C., but the additional fact 
that no ammunition for the gun was found 
in Fosters domicile leads to some trou
bling questions. Considering that a gun of 
that type holds at most six rounds, and 
ammunition is sold in boxes of 20 or 50, 
whered the rest go?
As if this rather dark cloud that hangs 
around this isnt enough, how about the 
fact that Fosters office wasnt sealed off 
for a number of hours after he was re
ported dead. In fact some of the Whitehouse 
aides raided the office to recover materi
als. What these were remains a mystery.
may incriminate 
them. Id say this 
bodes quite ill for the 
Clinton administra
tion.
Twenty years ago, 
a Presidential admin
istration went down 
in flames because of a 
burglary and the 
cover-up (not all, but 
the core of it). Now we have the case of a 
possible homicide and the ensuing coverup. Will this administration follow the 
same course? The election of a Republi
can Congress is likely to give some impe
tus to an investigation which had been 
stalled by a Democratic majority in the 
prior Congress. Only time can tell, but Id 
have to say that this time, the stakes look 
a little more severe than a burglary. 
Murder is serious business.

three days away, students are

Baseball Club opens season
0y MATTHEW SOLITRO
far tan Sports Editor
While owners, players, and judges arrued about the 1995 major league basejall season, the CMU Baseball Club was 
jut there playingball. They started their 
spring season this past week with four 
is, including a doubleheader on 
Saturday. They came away with one win 
and three losses, but the Club President 
nuj Gupta is very pleased with the 
learn.
Were a lot better than we were in the 
said Gupta. We have three new 
guys who are making a big impact.... Im 
really optimistic about the season.
He is also excited about the develop
ment of the program. Its gone beyond 
my expectations. If you would have told 
last year that we would have a 20-
Volume 89. Issue 20The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania3 April 1995
game schedule, full uniforms, and a 
coach, I would have said no way!
On Saturday, the team struggled 
against CCAC-Main Campus in both 
games of their doubleheader, as they 
lost 173 and 9-3. They also lost to 
Westmoreland Community College 15 
7 on Thursday. However, the team 
opened its season with a 9-7 win over 
CCAC-Boyce Campus on Tuesday.
The lack of practice facilities has hin
dered the teams performance during 
the games in this early part of the 
season. We just havent had enough 
practice time, said Gupta. Intramurals 
take precedence over us in the gym, and 
the field at Mellon Park wasnt in good 
enough condition to practice on until 
last week.
Pitching and the infield are the 
strengths of this Tartan squad, accord
ing to Gupta. The top four hurlers for the 
team are junior and co-captain Eric 
Boduch, sophomore Scott Kept, junior Tom 
OFarrell, and freshman Alec Maki.
The base of the field players is fresh
man. Utility infielder/pitcher Jay 
McCormack, first baseman Ed Cudahy, 
and third baseman Brian White are all 
freshmen.
Sophomore catcher Joe Smarrelli is the 
informal team glue according to Gupta. 
Junior Mike Monico has been hitting well, 
and solid defense has been provided by 
senior Mike Foley and junior Dave Hines.
The team has two big events later this 
season. For their first home game, they 
will play a former big-time Division I team, 
the University of Buffalo, at Pullman Park, 
a former minor league park in Butler. On 
April 20, they will play a game in Three 
Rivers Stadium.

Senior attackman Steve McAlonan takes a shot on the lllinios goal.
Lacrosse team hosts 
tournament with Pitt
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
This weekend, 12 teams from six 
states descended on Oakland for 
the fifth annual Pittsburgh Lacrosse 
Shootout. This event, held in CMUs 
Gesling Stadium and Pitts Cost 
Center, pitted teams against each 
other in tournament play, with one 
point being awarded for each quar
ter won, three points for each half, 
and five points for winningthe game. 
After each team played three games, 
point totals were used to determine 
which teams would play in the fi
nals on Sunday.
The top six teams fought for the A 
bracket championship, and the next 
four teams battled for the B bracket 
championship, while the two low
est-ranked teams were eliminated 
from competition. Participating in 
this year's tournament were teams 
from Brockport Lacrosse Club, Vir
ginia Tech, Fordham Rams, 
Fredonia State, University of Illi
nois, University of Michigan, Uni
versity of Kentucky, Penn State 
University, Pittsburgh Lacrosse 
Club, and Shippensburg University, 
along with host teams Pitt and CMU.
CMU began the tournament with 
a 9-3 loss to Brockport, in which 
midfieldman John Seekings scored 
two goals. They came back strong 
on Saturday morning with a 6-4 
win over Shippensburg. Scoring 
was highly spread out in this game, 
with freshmen midfieldmen Jay 
Miolla and Derek Jander and 
attackman Jason Louie each con
tributing to the win. CMU took an
other loss that afternoon 11-3 
against Illinois, despite the efforts 
of senior attackman Steve 
McAlonan, who scored two goals,
and Louie, who scored one. This per
formance earned them a game on Sun
day, which they were unfortunately 
forced to forfeit.
Virginia Tech went home with the 
championship title after defeating the 
University of Michigan.
About the teams performance, 
sophomore defenseman John 
Brzustowicz said, Weve been seeing 
a lot of individuals with good stickwork, 
but weve had a problem jelling as a 
team. Overall, the players are im
proving. Friday, we had definite prob
lems working as a team, but... in the 
win [over Shippensburg] we were do
ing good. Sophomore midfieldman 
Aron Ralston said, The scoring was 
very spread out, more so than usual. 
Jander said, I thought we showed 
great effort... we just got out-shot a 
couple games. We were able to come 
together and show some team cohe
siveness. We didnt play like that the 
whole tournament, however.
Coach John Moriarty said, It was a 
great tournament. It was a chance to 
bring some really good lacrosse to Pitts
burgh. The tournament is meant as a 
chance for a large number of teams to 
get together and play competitively 
against teams that they normally 
wouldnt see during the course of a 
season. Brzustowicz said, Its kind of 
like a big lacrosse party. Its a chance 
to hang around with other lacrosse 
players instead of just getting in the 
bus after the game and leaving. 
Moriarty was pleased with his teams 
performance, saying that CMU played 
better than was expected of them.
In the upcoming weeks, the CMU 
Lacrosse team will be participating in 
a tournament at St. Vincents College, 
as well as competing against Grove 
City College and Slippery Rock Uni
versity, who are both in the division.

the last article in this weekly seCorey: Well, It looks like Im 
not too far off. My pick for leader 
in the Central Division was De
troit, and surprise! Detroit is on 
top of that division by six points. 
Chicago, St. Louis, and Toronto 
arent out of the picture by any 
means, but Ill stick to my guns 
and continue with Detroit.
Eric: I chose Detroit in another 
shocker, but I also predicted that 
the Blues and Hawks would chal
lenge. Detroits still the team to 
beat in the division, and now Im 
not so sure the Blues can catch 
them. Actually, though, Im go
ing to go out on a limb and predict 
the Hawks will win the division. 
Theyve really impressed me with 
the way theyve gone and sud
denly found some offense. Their 
special teams play has been phe
nomenal, and you have to love Ed 
Belfour! Five words: Bernie 
Nicholls, He Da Man!
Corey: Interesting. Moving on, 
though, to the Pacific Division: I 
chose Calgary to lead the divi
sion, and theyre on top by seven 
points over L.A. I must admit 
that Im surprised L.A. is that 
close, but this whole division is 
tight with only a 13-point spread 
from top (Calgary) to bottom (Ana
heim). So, once again, Ill stick to 
my choice and say Calgary takes 
the Pacific.
Eric: Bye bye Sharks! I picked 
them to challenge Calgary. 
Calgary has to deal with losing 
some key players to injury; I dont
know if they can hold on. In gen
eral, the Pacific Division is pretty 
pathetic. Calgary may limp into 
the playoffs as the division-winner, but watch out for the young 
legs of Edmonton.
Corey: In the Northeast, I 
originally picked the Pens. Even 
though they are currently in sec
ond place behind Quebec, I will 
still say the Pens. Theyre my 
team, you know, and theyve had 
to work through some key inju
ries (Stevens, Barrasso, Wregget, 
Ulf, Chris Joseph, and the list 
goes on). Quebec will be pesky. In
four games this year, Quebec won 
two and Pittsburgh won two, with 
none of the four games decided by 
more than two goals. These teams 
are very close. The rest of the 
division is behind, with Boston as 
the next competitor, 1 Opoints be
hind Pittsburgh. The Bruins will 
make the playoffs, but wont last 
too long.
Eric: I picked the Pens, too. 
Quebec sure looks good, though. 
The Pens really need a young, 
quality defenseman. If they can 
get one, and their goaltending

There are high expectations for 
 mens and womens tennis 
*ams this spring. Both teams, 
ached by Pete Moss, are aiming
0 do well in the UAA ChampionlhiPs in Atlanta hosted by Emory 
University.
Senior Mike Macedonia said, 
Were looking to have more sucess than last year. This is the 
longest mens team weve had 
^ the past four years. 
Assistant Coach Sharyn 
tunno said that the womens 
eam fliay have a tough year since
this is primarily a rebuilding year 
and the team is facing a tough 
conference.
The top six players on the mens 
team are freshmen Jim Freese, 
Navroze Marshall, and DanVilco, 
seniors Macedonia and Bill 
Mathy, and graduate student 
John Muza. Macedonia said that 
both Freese and Marshall had 
high rankings in their respective 
states of Hawaii and California.
The womens team consists of 
freshman Jackie Autieri, sopho
mores Michelle Cook and Shauna 
Quill, juniors Namita Amin and 
Miriam Huang, and senior 
Stephanie Kukura. Rotunno said
that most of these players will be 
playing together for the first time.
We had two seniors graduate 
last year so some players were 
able to move up, said Rotunno.
The season officially started 
with competitions held at Hilton 
Head, South Carolina. Both 
teams played a series of matches 
for one week. The mens team 
finished with three wins and four 
losses.
Freese, the number one seed, 
stated that the team did well con
sidering the long winter. We 
didnt get to play much over win
ter so we could have done better 
had we been in better condition.
The team has defeated two UAA 
opponents, Johns Hopkins and 
Case Western, so far in the sea
son, he said.
The womens team finished 
with one win and six losses. 
Rotunno explained that the team 
progressed throughout the week 
and finished with a win on the 
last day. The trip was beneficial 
because the team got to know 
each other.
Coaches and players on both 
teams agree that there is little 
intra-squad competition. Accordingto Macedonia, players are very 
cooperative and supportive of 
each other and they are all look
ing to benefit the 
team.
The womens team 
will travel to Allegh
eny College on Mon
day afternoon, and 
the mens team will 
host Westminster 
College on Tuesday at
4 pm. The mens team 
will travel to Penn 
State-Behrend Col
lege on Saturday.
The UAA Tennis 
Championships will 
be held at Emory Uni

UCLA, Arkansas close out March Madness
Below the Rim
by Darren Chiapetta
Well, weve made it. From 64 down to 
two. Three weeks of basketball ecstasy 
comes to a close tonight in Seattle as 
Arkansas and UCLA square off for the 
NCAA championship. Arkansas will be 
making its second straight appearance 
in the title game, looking to become the 
second team to win consecutive tour
neys in the last five years. UCLA, on the 
other hand, will be making its first trip 
to the finals since 1980, when they lost 
to Louisville.
After escaping a second-round game 
against Syracuse when Lawrence Moten 
called a timeout his team didnt have, 
Nolan Richardsons Hogs are peaking 
now, holding North Carolina to 25 per
cent shooting in Saturdays semifinal 
win. After point guard Tyus Edney went 
coast-to-coast to beat Missouri in the 
second round, the Bruins have picked up 
momentum as well, with Edney scoring 
21 points, including 9 of 11 from the free 
throw line, to lead the Bruins past Okla
homa State in the other semi.
The key to the game for UCLA will be 
pressure. On the court, the question will 
be whether or not Edney will make good 
decisions against Arkansas 40 Min
utes of Hell pressure defense. Off the 
court, the question will be whether or 
not Bruins coach Jim Harrick will fi
nally be able to escape the shadow of 
John Wooden.
Now, a head-to-head comparison of 
the two teams (UCLA listed first):
POINT GUARD: Tyus Edney vs. Corey 
Beck. Edney has been phenomenal in the 
tournament, with the highlight being the 
full-court mad dash-and-basket with no 
time remaining that beat Missouri. Has 
done a good job handling pressure, and 
must continue to do so for the Bruins to 
have a chance tonight. Beck is not the 
scorer Edney is, but is a great playmaker, 
a smart leader, and a tenacious defender. 
He is perhaps the only guard in the tour
nament who might be able to keep up with 
Edney, speed-wise. Edge goes to Edney.
GUARD: Toby Bailey vs. Clint 
McDaniel. Freshman Bailey is a great 
talent, but hes young and inconsistent. 
Followed up a 26-point performance 
against Connecticut in the regional final 
with a one-for-two, two point performance 
Saturday. In a one-game scenario, how
ever, he could be the X Factor. McDaniel is 
a senior with one-and-a-half Final Fours 
under his belt. That experience, along with 
McDaniels tremendous defensive ability, 
could make it a long night for Bailey when 
Arkansas plays man-to-man. Edge goes to 
McDaniel.
CENTER: George Zidek/J. R. Henderson 
vs. Elmer Martin/Dwight Stewart. Zidek 
is solid when hes not in foul trouble. Hell 
spend much of his time if the Bruins go 
man chasing Stewart, who plays the ma
jority of the minutes in the middle for 
Arkansas. Whoevers at center will give 
away a few inches to Zidek, whos a sevenfooter. Freshman J. R. Henderson gets 
substantial minutes in the paint for the 
Bruins. A toss-up, but give the nod to 
UCLA.
FORWARD: Charles OBannon vs. 
Scotty Thurman.
Charles, the younger of the two OBannon 
brothers, is a solid player and can usually 
be counted on to score at least 15 points a 
night. Thurman is Nolan Richardsons 
erratic but immensely talented Cool Hand 
Luke. So relaxed on the court he some
times looks asleep, he can go on a scoring
spree at any time. He can also go ice cold 
at any time, as he did Saturday when he 
scored six points on two-of-ten shooting, 
including two-for-nine behind the arc. He 
usually comes up big in pressure situa
tions, though. He has four game-winning 
shots this season, and, remember, it was 
Thurman who won last years title game 
against Duke with a three-pointer as the 
shot clock expired. Edge goes to Thurman.
FORWARD: Ed OBannon vs. Corliss 
Williamson. A contrast in styles is the 
best way to describe the talents of these 
two. OBannon, who has won several 
Player of the Year awards, is a smooth 
small forward-type who can shoot out
side and drive to the basket equally well. 
Williamson, last years Final Four Most 
Outstanding Player, is a bull inside, and,
Francine Gemperle/Tartan Art Co-Editor
despite the fact he is only 6'7", rarely 
strays further than 10 feet from the bas
ket, but he -can score outside when called 
upon. He almost knocked CBS announc
ers out of their chairs when he hit two 18- 
foot jump shots in the regional final win 
against Virginia.
Despite all of OBannons accolades, he 
has been relatively quiet the last few 
games. He may be ready to bust out. Edge 
goes to OBannon.
BENCH: Despite the fact that UCLA is 
such an up-tempo team, they have a fairly 
thin bench. Other than the Zidek/ 
Henderson rotation at center and the fairly 
substantial minutes guard Cameron Dol
lar receives, youd be hard-pressed to find 
anyone else on the UCLA roster that gets 
on the court too often. When Harrick puts 
Dollar on the point and moves Edney to 
the two-guard, look for matchup problems 
for Arkansas. The Razorbacks often go 
nine or 10 deep, one of the reasons why 
they always seem so fresh late in games. 
Stewart gets most of the minutes at center 
anyway, and Davor Rimac gives 
Richardsons squad an offensive spark 
Look for Richardson to substitute fre
quently and try to wear down the Bruins 
Edge goes to Arkansas.
COACHES: Jim Harrick vs. Nolan 
Richardson. Harrick needs to win this 
game to get the media, who have blamec 
him for much of UCLAs tournament 
troubles in recent years, off his back 
Richardson is trying to do what only two 
other coaches have done in the last 22 
years  win back-to-back titles. Harrick 
has done a nice job realizing that his team 
with dynamo Edney at the point, must run 
to win. This sometimes-frenetic, alwayshectic tempo has brought UCLA to the 
title game with a 30-2 record and a streak 
of not being held under 70 points in any 
game this season. Richardson coaches de 
fense and conditioning, two factors which 
always seem to put Arkansas in a position 
to win games. It hasnt hurt that the Hogs 
have had quite a bit of luck in the touma 
ment this year, but as Richardson keeps 
telling everybody, theres usually a reason 
why good teams seem to get lucky. Edge 
goes to Richardson.
So whos going to win? Two fairly evenly 
matched teams, both of which have fine 
coaches. Again, the key may be how well 
Edney reads Arkansas constantly-chang
ing defenses and handles their pressure.

Track teams compete at Emory during break
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan. Assistant Sports Editor
The CMU Track and Field 
team hit the road on Saturday, 
March 25, to participate in the 
Emory Spring Break Invita
tional.
The mens team was led by 
sophomore Ron Polcawich, who 
won the 3,000-meter steeple
chase in a time of 10:18.59, and 
placed fifth in the 5,000-meters 
with his 16:25.48 time.
Junior Zack Conly also had a 
strong showing, placing fifth in 
the 110-meter hurdles in 16.06 
seconds and sixth in the 400- 
meter hurdles in 57.05 seconds. 
Junior Hiro Kanaya also con
tributed with his third-place, 
50.01-meter throw in the jav
elin.
The mens team placed ninth 
out of the 12 teams participat
ing. The womens team also did 
well, finishing eighth out of 14
participating teams.
Junior Melissa Baustert led 
the women by winning the 800- 
meter run. Her time of 2:17.66 
set a new school record.
Sophomore Leslie Brown 
threw the hammer 31.48 meters 
for second place and threw the 
discus 35.60 meters for third 
place.
Freshman Melissa Lott fin
ished fifth in the 3,000-meters 
in 11:03.66. Sophomore Becky 
Buchheit finished right after 
Lott in the 3,000-meters to gain 
a sixth-place finish and a time of 
11:07.01. Buchheit also placed 
sixth in the 1,500-meter run in a 
time of 5:00.39.
The track teams also travelled 
to Bethany on Saturday to par
ticipate in the Bethany College 
Relays. The mens team placed 
fourth out of the five teams with 
43 points, and the womens team 
placed second with 45 points.
The men were led by outstand
ing performances by Conly and 
freshman Jeff Jones in both the 
hurdles and their other respec
tive sports. Sophomore Joe 
Rogishs performance in the jav
elin was also noteworthy.
For the womens team, the
sprints were strong all day, high
lighted by their win in the sprint 
medley; the team was made up of 
freshman Kelly OBrien, fresh
man Jessica Connolly, sophomore 
Vonquitra Bebee, and Baustert. 
Sophomore Penny Summerville
provisionally qualified for nation
als with her performance in the 
javelin.
The Tartans will be participat
ing in one of their few home meets 
this coming Sunday as they host 
the Carnegie Mellon Invitational.

experience to be the difference 
in their race with Quebec. If the 
Penguins cant find some D and 
consistent goaltending, the 
Nords have it.
Corey: The Rangers are in 
fifth place in the Atlantic Divi
sion but only nine points out of 
first. I had picked them to win it. 
Philadelphia has come on really 
strong lately, and is four points 
up on New Jersey. Eric Lindros 
is a force to be 
reckoned with, 
and Philly has 
a good chance 
to take this di
vision with the 
addition of 
LeClair and

they cant hold 
up, look for 
New Jersey to 
slip into first, 
if their goaltending tan
dem of Brodeur andTerreri plays 
up to potential. Dont count 
Washington out as divisionleader, especially now with the 
young goaltending star Jim 
Carey and the new-found offen
sive prowess of Bondra. How
ever, I dont look for them to go 
too far in the playoffs unless
Mark
they find another offensive for
ward.
Eric: Lindros, Renberg, 
LeClair, wham\Need I say more? 
Thats one line of monstrous pro
portions and skill. Too bad they 
dont have much depth, but those 
three guys just may be enough. 
Check out the Caps, who I pre
dicted would win the division, 
by the way! After starting off 
horrendously, the Caps have 
stormed back into it. Rookie 
goalie Jim Carey is amazing, 
and the Caps 
finally have 
some offense. 
Any team with 
a New in 
front of its lo
cation can for
get about it! 
Caps all the 
way, baby! 
Cmon!

Corey is a senior MSE JEcon

Eric's heart and dedication,

toward the local adult beginner's 
league to draft him as their goon 
defenseman.

According to President Mike Sheldrick, 
paintball is a very safe sport. All players 
are required to wear specially de
signed paintball goggles and 
masks. Players are also advised to 
wear long-sleeve pants and shirts 
for extra protection. Sheldrick 
said, The most commonly asked 
question is always about the pain 
after getting hit by a pellet. All I 
can say is that it does sting, but 
the adrenaline from the game 
keeps you from noticing any pain. 
Commenting on the gender stereotypes 
of the sport, Sheldrick said, Although 
paintball is a male-dominated sport, 
there are more females getting involved 
with the sport. Presently the club has
some very talented females. Sheldrick 
also said that the sport does not require
Alan Petrillo/Tartan Artist 
athletic talent but is solely based on 
skill. Everyone who plays paintball al
ways start on the same foot.
The equipment used in paintball var
ies. Beginners usually use a basic pump
gun. After some experience players can 
also play with semi-automatic or follyautomatic guns. In addition to guns, 
players must also purchase their own 
paint pellets. Total costs of the sport 
range from $50 to $1,500. However, play
ers can also rent equipment which typi
cally costs from $20 to $25. All equip
ment can be purchased through the 
paintball club.
The club participates in games at reg
istered fields. The three most common 
areas are Urban Assault (outdoor, in
door) Hamburger Hill (outdoor), and Fort 
Splat (outdoor). Outside terrain consists 
of specific boundaries and is specifically 
designed for paintball. Indoor games are 
held in a warehouse lit by a black light
and consists of many obstacles. The two 
main types of games are scenario and 
tournament and consist of two teams. 
The object is to capture the opponents 
flag and take it back to the flag station. 
In tournament play, only one flag is 
placed in the center of the field and the 
purpose is to take possession of it. Al
though games are held throughout the 
year, the peak season is in the fall.
The club also introduces the sport to 
many students on campus. Sheldrick 
said,
The club likes to work with the RAs, 
fraternities, and other student organi
zations to get the students involved with 
the sport. The college atmosphere is the 
ideal situation to learn paintball.

95 Spring Carnival Preview:Animation in Action
ceph!Hed Stnr!H!r!tn thd!Hth c,u Lflh!rG
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Staffwriter
To me, Spring Carnival is the most 
important event on this campus. For one 
weekend, people come together in order 
i have fun, something rare at CMU, 
aid Siddharth Suri, senior electrical 
ind computer engineering/industrial 
lanagement major and member of this 
years Spring Carnival committee. With 
hat in mind, this years Carnival theme 
s A Few Strokes for Wild Animated 
Action, which is centered around our 
favorite cartoons, ranging from the 
Animaniacs to Itchy and Scratchy, and 
will kick off this Friday.
To come up with a theme, we [booth 
chairs] basically brainstorm for half an 
hour then decide on a few through elimi
nation. We then present the idea to the 
Carnival committee, who decides on the 
slogan. The committee usually holds a 
contest of some sort, asking people to 
submit ideas for a logo, T-shirts and 
other such purposes, said Suri.
This years logo is half a TV screen 
spewing out, Spring Carnival 95. There 
are also two new mascots, Mr. Pencil 
and Smiley Brush, in spirit of the chosen 
theme.
The main purpose in having a theme 
for Carnival is to unite the Midway in 
some aspect. Its a lot easier to throw 
out a theme, then ask various groups 
) build a booth, rather than 
asking them to come up with 
something random. It gives 
direction to the project, said 
Suri. This years theme also 
allows for much 
ibility, acting as 
inspiration as
to a limitaSpring Carnival has 
been held in the Skibo 
parking lot in the past, but 
will take place behind Morewood 
Gardens dormitory this year. The far 
side of the Morewood parking lot, 
ing Fifth Avenue, will be set up with 
atentforperformances and other 
featured shows of the event, 
while the Midway will 
hold a variety of 
booths repre
senting a 
variety of 
campus
organizations. The remaining area will 
hold rides and other miscellaneous ac
tivities. Due to insufficient parking ar
eas, cars will be taken by valet from 
Morewood Gardens on Friday, only to be 
released on Monday after Carnival. 
Hence, those parking on campus will not 
be able to access their vehicles during 
the weekend.
Spring Carnival can be broken down 
into two competitions, Booth and Buggy, 
both offering an array of activities 
throughout the festival. The buggy ac
tion all begins with a buggy design com
petition on Thursday, with the prelimi
nary races starting at 7:30 am Friday. 
The final race takes place Saturday 
morning at the same time, the awards 
will be held on the Cut at 7:30 pm that 
evening. As for the rest of Carnival, the 
fun kicks off with opening ceremonies on 
the Midway at 5 pm Thursday, which 
will be followed by live entertainment 
from a magician, hypnotist, or singer. In 
light of the theme, Billy West, the voice 
of Ren and Stimpy, will be giving a 
lecture from 7:30-9 pm in Doherty Hall.
There will also be activities for chil
dren on the Midway, on Saturday 12 - 
1 pm. Other events to look forward to on 
Saturday include Virtual 
Reality 3000 and 
the acousfolk-rock of Roger Gillen in the Midway 
tent. The rest of the afternoon is filled 
with concerts under the tent and finally 
live entertainment at the closing. CMUs 
talents such as the Kiltie Band and the 
Jazz Esemble will perform on Sunday 
along with more fun with Virtual Real
ity from noon to 6 pm.
Another concert on the Cut follows at 
3 pm, with the closing ceremonies begin
ning at 11pm. Booths and rides for all 
ages will be held on the Morewood lot 
throughout the weekend. WRCT (88.3), 
as well as other local radio stations will 
be covering all Carnival events.
The first annual Mobot competition, 
in which teams of CMU undergraduates 
race small, autonomous vehicles, will 
take place during Carnival. Each Mobot 
must navigate through gates placed 
along a white stripe painted on the side
walk in front of Wean Hall (near the 
Fifth Floor entrance). The final Mobot 
competition offers students an opportu
nity to enjoy technology in action, and 
will take place on Saturday, April 8, 
from 11am to about 1:30 pm. The Mobot 
course is a short walk from the Buggy 
course (a few hundred feet from Buggy 
Hill 4).

Oh, what a year it has been. A new 
chute. Great weather. Plenty of 
rolls. The occasional chow at the 
bridge (thanks to all who 
obliged). Sounds like the mak
ings for a perfect day of races.
Seriously though, it appears 
that Mother Natures kind 
heart and the Dept, of Public 
Works may combine to make 
Sweepstakes 95 the year to 
beat all others.
With all of the organi
zations having lots of 
time to qualify, this years 
raceday weekend prom
ises to be action-packed! 
Look for a close race between 
PiKA and Spirit this year (re
ally?).
The two have combined for more wins in recent 
years than ... well Ill be damned, they are the only 
organizations to have won in recent years.
In 94, PiKA swept the whole dealmens, womens, 
and mechanics  but dont look for a repeat this 
weekend.
Unless their push team can make it by 
on ego (because they sure dont have 
the experience or bodies), PiKA looks 
to be a good candidate for a consolaprize.
Spirit, on the other hand, who deci
sively lost the title last year due to a poor push 
earn, has made strides toward improvement. Their 
pushers look good and their buggies can still cut the mustard, making 
them my pick for first place in 95 (as long as those crazy joggers can stay clear of 
the chute).
Meanwhile, look for more of the same from everyone else, as none of the other

Remember Saturday 
morning cartoons? Everyone 
has awakened early on a Sat
urday to vegetate in front of the 
television eating cereal and watch
ing everything from Scooby-Doo to 
Bugs Bunny.
Though many CMU students have 
outgrown this particular weekend ritual, 
cartoons are a part of our childhood and 
culture. The 1995 Spring Carnival, with its 
theme of A Few Strokes for Wild Animated 
Action, is sure to bring back some of those 
, cherished memories of hyper-animated Satur
days. Booths are a key component of the Carnival 
experience, and are sure to add to the animated 
,eXcitement this weekend.
Ive been impressed with the booths Ive seen so 
jfer. Ive already seen seven two-story booths, said
Greg Mumpower, junior mechanical engineering 
major and Phi Kappa Theta booth chair.
This years booths promise to be as impressive as 
those in past years, if not more so. Phi Kappa 
Theta, which has won in the fraternity category for 
the past five years, has chosen The Addams Fam
ily as their theme.
We thought it would be fun to have a haunted 
house for the kids, because we usually dont do a lot 
for the kids. We hope to be competitive but we 
really just want to go out and have a good time this 
year. We want to build something better than we 
ever have before, said Mumpower.
The location of the Carnival Midway in Morewood 
Parking Lot, due to the construction of the student 
center, has meant big changes for those working on 
booth.
With no construction allowed between 10pm and 
8 am, organizations are finding it difficult to find 
the time to do any significant work on the booths.
Its a hindrance having Carnival in Morewood, 
said Nicole Duguay, a senior industrial manage
ment and Kappa Kappa Gamma booth chair. We 
can only build at certain times because we have to 
stop making noise at 10 pm. We used to stay out 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. KKG is doing 
Scooby-Doo as its theme.
Most the time we cant get people out on Midway 
until late at night, so we dont get as much done,
said Corwin Yu, a senior in industrial manage
ment and Asian Student Association chair. I think 
we also probably have the longest trek to Midway 
 all the way from the Tech garage, and our booth 
is almost 20 feet tall. Its a real pain.
For Sig Tau, moving their Mickey Mouse booth 
onto the Midway has presented a plethora of prob
lems. Weve completely changed what were doing 
because of Midway being in Morewood, said Erik 
Witte, a junior math/computer science major and 
Sig Tau booth chair. Were doing something to
tally different from the way we usually build our 
booths. Essentially, were doing a miniature golf 
course.
Moving was especially hard. The size of the 
booth made it nearly impossible, said Mumpower.
Although the location of Midway has caused 
problems for the organizations participating in 
booth, most students see it as a trade-off.
The restricted hours and further distance are 
balanced by the sheer size of Morewood Parking 
Lot  a huge improvement on the tiny space of 
Skibo Parking Lot.
Its harder for the organizations, but its better 
for Midway. You can have more rides in a larger 
area, and the main tent will be closer to Midway, 
said Mumpower.
Carnival will be much bigger in scale this year, 
agreed Yu, The parking lot is almost bigger than
all of Skibo was! I dont think people really care 
where Midway is. I dont think having fun at 
Carnival has anything to do with where Midway 
is, he said.
Despite the problems, booth participants are 
offering an impressive line-up of structures and 
games, all harkening back to our cartoon days.
Delta Upsilon has chosen the popular Smurfs 
for their theme, with Alpha Epsilon Pi taking 
Animaniacs and Pi Kappa Alpha doing Batman.
More traditional themes that some organiza
tions are following will be Popeye by SOP, HeMan by Delta Tau Delta, Yogi Bearby PiLam, 
Peanuts by SDC, the Flinstones by KSA, Fat 
Albert by Spirit, the Road Runner by Fringe, 
Winnie the Pooh by ASA, and the Jetsons by 
Delta Delta Delta.
Some of the organizations have chosen more 
eclectic themes, with Kappa Sig doing the grue
some Itchy and Scratchy, the baseball team doing 
Speed Racer, KAO doing Dungeons &Dragons, 
the Swim team doing the Tick, SAE doing Ren 
and Stimpy, and Beta choosing Beavis and 
Butthead.
Other booths to look out for are the Pioneers 
Ghostbusters, KGBs Peter and the Wolf, Kappa 
Delta Rhos Conan the Barbarian, Delta Gammas 
Charlottes Web, and the Hockey teams Peter 
the Puck.

CMU rapes contradict national figures
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriter
The topic of rape is rarely mentioned 
at this University. This is a baffling fact 
considering that statistics indicate that 
one in four women in college will experi
ence rape or attempted rape by the time 
she graduates. It can only be concluded,
, then, that women who have been raped 
and will be raped exist at CMU. Its not 
a shocking fact. Rape occurs anywhere. 
CMU is not exempt.
Rape and sexual assault are prob. lems at large, and I think that college 
. campuses like ours are no different,
. said Harriet Schwartz, Assistant to the 
, Dean of Student Affairs and Coordina
tor of Sexual Assault Advisors.
Based on a _____________________
myriad of na. tional surveys, 
a woman is 
raped every 10 
seconds. How
ever, the fact 
that only one in
10 rapes is re
ported must be 
considered.
Approximately
the actual experience is a disruption of 
the victims life. For some women, it 
changes their outlook on life especially 
those women who have been date raped. 
They have to come to terms with the fact 
that they truly cannot trust anyone. For 
others, it is sort of a turning point. It 
makes them view the world in a com
pletely different light. Its difficult for
Someone will accompany you to the 
hospital and let you know what your 
resources are, she said.
However, Schwartz recognizes that 
while many victims want help, they ex
perience much internal conflict over be
ing counseled. Its often very difficult 
for someone who has been raped or as
saulted to reach out for help. There is a
many women to deal with the sense of lot of good support here on campus to get
victimization that they feel. The whole 
experience is overwhelming.
Fortunately, CMU, as well as Pitts
burgh, offers outlets for victims of rape 
to get help, counseling, and support.
The Counseling Center which is lo
cated in Morewood Gardens offers a 24- 
hour hotline at 268-2922. The center 
will connect the caller to one of the 25

85 percent of rapes that take place on sexual assault advisors. This group of in many instances, those who have been

10 date rapes go unreported.
A number of reasons go into why a 
woman does not report a rape, said 
Kristen Eisenbraun, Emergency Advo
cate Specialist at Pittsburgh Action 
Against Rape (PAAR).
Many times the woman is in denial 
and cannot identify with the rape. She 
may be afraid of the perpetrator, espe
cially in the instance of acquaintance 
rape. Rape laws are not victim-friendly. 
They make it difficult for those who have 
been raped to come to terms with the 
rape.
Victims of rape also have to deal with 
the social stereotypes as well as their 
families and friends. Society has a set 
image of a rape victim and why that 
person was raped, she added.
The effects a rape can have on a person 
are profound. The aftermath of rape 
ranges from denial and fear to anger and 
helplessness.
Eisenbraun said, Each woman deals 
with rape in her own different way, but
faculty, staff, and students.
Schwartz said, The advisors have 
undergone extensive training designed 
to provide them with facts on rape and 
sexual assault and also a sense of the 
campus andlocal residences, legal, medi
cal, and safety issues, as well as training 
and experience with helping skills.
Sexual assault advisors have been 
trained to provide support for anyone 
who has been assaulted or raped. They 
provide support for someone with a friend 
who has been raped as well. Anyone can 
turn to us, she added.
Sexual assault advisors also hold 
group lectures and programs. If an RA 
or student leader wants us to talk to a 
group, we are more than willing to do 
that, said Schwartz.
Schwartz encourages those who have 
been raped or assaulted not to hesitate 
to contact someone on campus. If some
one doesnt know where to turn, contact 
an advisor, Campus Police, or the Coun
seling Center.

raped can go to or call Pittsburgh Action

Fight censorship on Net
Focused on the Internet
by Kenton Shaver
Lately some of our politicians have 
been pining to dictate laws to assert 
their control over the Internet and 
computer networks in general. Promi
nent among recent attempts is a bill 
entitled The Communications De
cency Act of 1995, to be shortly con
sidered by the U.S. Senate. Lets look 
at a few of the things that will happen 
should technologically-ignorant legis
lators pass this ill-conceived bill.
First, this medium, computer tele
communications, is in danger of be
coming a tool of censorship and thought 
control of an awesome scale that 
George Orwell never dreamed of, no 
matter what the purported intentions 
of its would-be regulators. At best, 
passage of this bill will make it your 
responsibility to become a lawyer, like 
Senator Exonis, lest you unknowingly 
violate one of our countrys laws be
cause what you now send, electroni
cally, would be material to use against 
you in a court of law.
Lets examine further that facet  
the issue of censorship of electronic 
text messages. Senator Exon would 
lead his fellows to deprive you of the 
ability to send indecent electronic 
material. This is merely a blunt in
strument of harassment. Indecency 
has been and by precedent will con
tinue to be defined in terms of what is 
acceptable to the community.
There is obviously no way to gauge 
the standard of the Internet commu
nity, by its very definition, and at
tempt to limit it so that it, as a commu
nity, may be isolated and defined, rips 
out its heart  the free exchange of 
ideas and information  and decapi
tates its body to imprison in frag
mented local fiefdoms.
To you, the Andrew System user, 
this law and laws like it will make
your possession of an account a liabij. 
ity which can be used by your enemies 
if ever you are so unfortunate to accu. 
mulate these, as well as unseen network saboteurs  hackers  to put 
you under harrowing pain of signig. 
cant federal punishment for a crime' 
based on hearsay evidence.
It is in your best interest, clearly, jn 
this nightmare world of email censorship, not only to forego sending mes
sages of any sort, so that there 
nothing unscrupulous lawyers can use 
against you should you find yourself in 
such straits, but also not to have an 
account at all lest it be broken into 
mimicked either by directly breaking 
into it or by forging electronic mail in 
your name.
Weve glimpsed the ugly solutions 
proposed to some unpalatable use o! 
the Internet, but lets look at a parto: 
the problem that it aims to solve 
Most of us have seen the USENET 
message groups and have appreciate! 
their tremendous usefulness as a clear
ing house of information, where it is 
possible to get questions answered 
sundry relevant topics. As new 
newsgroups become needed, they typi 
cally gestate in the alt tree.
Later, if merited, they will transfei 
to one of the sanctioned trees of mes 
sage groups. Even groups that never 
complete this process of obtaining 
official sanction drain irrelevant 
untopical discussion from sanctionei 
discussion groups. As the Internet ant 
the USENET expand, this becomes 
more and more valuable a mechanism
Fortunately, no one here on this 
campus is helpless to prevent so-callet 
controls that do nothing but destroj 
structures already in place. If you 
vote, your congressman or congress
woman must know your feelings. Pe
tition sites on the Net have been opened 
to take your electronic signature 
graffiti, communica-tions-decency-actof-1995 contains the text of the bill in 
its original form which has since been 
altered but not improved.

PREDICTIONS, from page LI
organizations seem capable of 
capturing the throne so long 
held by you-know-who.
Also, look for SAE around 
the chute on raceday, as they 
will be trying to scrounge to
gether the necessary materi
als to compete next year. Mis
fortune (and destiny) have 
guaranteed these guys a view 
from the curb this year.
This years dark horse con
tender  Beta. They have the 
muscle (as always) to get over 
the hill, but this year they seem 
to have a buggy that matches 
their brawn.
Although I dont foresee a 
Beta victory outright, they 
have my vote if somebody (gee, 
who???) manages to spin like 
mad again and they remember 
that rule about the push bar 
and the finish line.
Then we have Sigma Nu, al
ways a bridesmaid, never a 
bride. Yes, those weird-looking kids on the comer always 
look to contend, but never seem 
to have what it takes to climb 
to the top.
Some time spent building 
pushers might benefit Sigma 
Nu more than building bug
gies ... maybe next year, guys.
Ahhh, Phi Kappa Theta ... 
these guys warm my heart and 
wet my eyes.
I think Phi Kap is the most 
enjoyable bunch to watch, be
cause they keep coming up with 
new ways to chow.
I just cant say enough about 
the joy they inspire as they 
roll, slide, bounce, grind, and 
tumble through the hay. An 
A for effort, but thats about 
it.
Lets see, whos next? OOOH, 
KDR, KDR!!! Yeah, if they can 
get off of hill one this year, they 
might just end up in the top 10.
After having spent the off
season doing some serious 
stress analysis, they could be
poised to keep it all together and 
make a respectable showing.
If the city lets them keep the 
course open over night, AEPi 
might make it through the chute 
by day two.
In all honesty, though, dont 
look for anything special from 
AEPi except maybe anti-lock 
brakes and a drivers side air bag.
What does CIA stand for any
way, and why do they bother? I 
suppose if their push bar deploys, 
they can cross the line, but its 
safe to say they wont be wres
tling away any trophies.
Oh boy, who else...? Fringe has 
bad design to the power of three, 
Kappa Sigma is rolling a barge 
that even Compubookie could fit 
into, and DTD just keeps pouring 
on the psychedelic paint. Give 
them all credit for coming out, 
but save the spotlight for the big
ger guns.
It appears that Sig Tau has 
been so busy looking for cheap 
movers that they have neglected 
their buggy program. Wait, my 
fault, they never had a chance 
anyway.
At least that camouflaged crate 
is easy on the eyes, but they ought 
to try the paint on their pushers 
(then we couldnt see any of them).
The Pioneers chair and his wife 
will be leading the way to the bar 
after day one, and the closest 
race of all will be had by DU and 
Theta Xi  on the midway.
Best of luck to all three, but I 
wouldnt worry about having time 
to spend with friends on day two.
Finally theres SDC. What can 
I say? Shut up?
I think theyd stand a better 
chance if the girls kept their 
mouths shut in an attempt to 
reduce drag. Thanks, but no 
thanks; better luck in 96.
As for the womens races, look 
for the same trends as above.
Im tempted to say that it could 
be Thetas year to shine behind 
Sig Nus buggies (in the absence 
of the womens soccer team be
hind PiKAs), but one just cant 
overlook the women of Spirit.
Without any real challenges 
this year, the Spirit girls stand 
the best chance of winning and 
maybe even breakingtheir own 
course record.
I just hope the lead truck can 
beat Spirit womens A-team up 
hill one.
If I have forgotten anyone, 
theres probably a reason.
As for everyone else, get 
ready for another exciting 
weekend of thrills and spills, 
as the newly paved course 
promises to provide broken 
records, broken buggies, and 
broken dreams.
Remember, the Chute is the 
place to be. So bring a camera 
and a broom, and Ill see you 
there.
Toward more picturesque 
speech:
Beta: Beta? F-CKYEAH!
CIA: C us lose.
DTD: They just arent really 
there, are they?
DU: Ducks Unlimited.
FRINGE: Keep trying.
KDR: 3-2-1 Bang! Crack
Phi Kap: Nothing like a roll 
in the hay ... LOOK OUT!
PiKA: Maybe with Betas 
pushers.
Pioneers: Yeah, right.
SAE: Save me a seat in the 
chute, guys.
Sigma Nu: Extra fast bug
gies, Extra Slow Pushers.
Sig Tau: Bye-bye ... Buy a 
buggy!
Spirit: Kings of the re-roll, 
kings of the spin, minus those 
PiKAs, theyll probably vfan.
SDC: Buy some muzzles.
TX: A rebuilding year?
Kappa Sig: Not enough hair, 
too much buggy.
Pi Lam: Ooops, sorry.

between living and living well after your working years 
are over.
Contributions to your SRAs are deducted from 
your salaiy on a pre-tax basis. That lowers your 
current taxable income, so you start saving on taxes 
right away. Whats more, any earnings on your SRAs 
are also tax-deferred until you receive them as income.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  3 April 1995L3
CMU Sweepstakes competition stands the test of time
gy JAMES STEPANEK
Tartan Staffwriter
Well, now that Carnival is right 
around the bend, youve probably 
noticed some strange activities 
that go on at night and on week
end mornings if you have a car. 
Its probably caused you some 
form of confusion or inconve
nience.
. The closed roads and interest
ing people inhabiting streets at 
odd hours may have left a strange 
impression. So whats going on? 
you may ask. This is Buggy, or 
Sweepstakes. Sweepstakes is one 
of the things that makes CMU 
unique. It is a race which consists 
of buggies which are pushed up
hill and rolled downhill.
; A small woman usually drives 
lit and they all tend to be torpedoshaped with three wheels. And 
'that is about the end of what 
igeneralizations apply to buggy.
 There are many people involved 
an this sport on campus, but the 
'rest of you folks probably wonder 
'what the hell all of it is about.
I can remember when I first 
joined a buggy organization all 
those years ago.
You have to be at freerolls; 
thats at dawn on a weekend, 
they told me.
What? Dawn exists on a week
end?!? I thought to myself.
1 I persevered one way or an
other and managed to make it to 
rolls. In fact, I actually managed 
;to get interested in rolls and the 
'rest of the mania that is Sweepstakes.
: Unfortunately this involves a 
whole lot of time put into a rather 
strange sink. You spend hours 
and hours working to win a race 
'which only CMU people care 
about. There are mechanics, de1 sign people, drivers and pushers.
Mechanics maintain the bug
gies and race prep them. Design
ers build them, and enhance their 
appearance for the design com
petition.
The drivers, who are, as previ
ously mentioned, just about all 
-small women these days, pilot 
_the odd vehicles around the 
course. They actually have a job 
which is envied by many a me
chanic and designer who, while 
they spend hours making these 
creations, never get to try them 
themselves.
The pushers, the other half of 
the equation with the buggies, 
work out and practice technique 
for their time of glory which will 
amount to somewhere under 20 
seconds each (thats two days of 
races if true glory is involved).
Of course there is also the nebu
lous support category with 
flaggers, sweepers, Chute
flaggers, timers, and all the rest 
who fill in the gaps.
Mind you, describing all of these 
positions independently is not 
that accurate since there is very 
often overlap in who does what.
The time commitment is huge. 
You sacrifice weekend mornings 
and most weekday nights at the 
very least. The designers and me
chanics lose even more time. 
Freerolls are the weekend morn
ing practice runs which allow 
drivers to gain experience rolling 
the course.
To qualify for races, drivers 
have to attain a prescribed num
ber of rolls in the buggy 
they will be competing 
in. Freerolls occur at 
this ungodly hour sim
ply because thats the 
only time that the city 
will grant a permit to 
close a stretch of public 
streets.
There is also push 
practice which is when 
pushers get to try their 
hands at pushing the 
buggies up the course 
as they will on raceday.
This occurs late at night 
for permit reasons (and 
to get out of the way of 
traffic) as well. Push 
practice often runs un
til 2 am for some orga
nizations, so it is easy 
to understand that this 
is a major commitment of time 
and effort.
Now why do we do this? I cant 
say. Why do people climb moun
tains? I guess its a challenge. In 
fact, its a hell of a challenge and 
one which evolves with time and 
technology.
It pits the best this school  
which is no mediocre institution 
 has to offer, against one an
other. It allows tests of engineer
ing and physical prowess to coin
cide and result in a very exciting 
and gripping race.
The race is about as old as the 
University, having started in the
early 20th century. Rules were a 
bit different then as were buggy 
designs and the course itself.
The race was between teams 
from different fraternities and 
was intended as a display of engi
neering, design and mechanical 
competence. Mechanical compe
tence was shown in many ways 
including a gladly-lapsed rule 
which stated that the buggies had 
to stop after the chute (the turn 
at the end of the downhill rolling 
portion) and the driver had to get 
out and rotate the tires. This rule 
was removed to enhance the ex
citement of the race.
some professors will. They had 
four wheels and consisted of a 
tube made of aluminum and a 
nose cone probably made of sheet 
metal or fiberglass. They were 
also quite heavy. A buggy of that 
era weighed around a 100 pounds 
even without the driver.
Lucky for the pushers of today, 
that number has dropped sharply. 
The last of the four-wheel bug
gies were phased out in the late 
80s. The last, I believe was Black 
Magic, CIAs buggy, which col
lected a few first place trophies in 
its day.
The 60s also saw an introducRobert Earhart/ Tartan Photographer 
Theta Xis buggy speeds through the Sweepstakes course during Saturday freerolls.
Buggy technology has long been 
a key factor in the race. Buggies 
began looking like soapbox derby 
cars with brothers of the frater
nity driving in a sitting position. 
I have inspected a buggy which 
remains from the fifties, and it is 
quite large with shock absorbers 
and a quite advanced steering 
system. The technology began to 
change in the sixties when ad
vanced aluminum alloys and the 
notion of driving headfirst were 
introduced.
Of course there are few people 
youll meet on campus wholl re
member this kind of buggy, but
tion ofthe independent organiza
tions. Fringe was the first of them. 
They were followed by CIA, SDC, 
Pioneers, and Spirit (not in this 
order). This changed the nature 
of the competition from a Greekonly event into a more campuswide event. CIA was the first of 
the independents to win the race, 
with triumphs in the late 70s 
and early 80s. Spirit is the cur
rent champ of the independents, 
having won Sweepstakes six time 
since 1987. This is a remarkable 
achievement for an organization 
which only stared participating 
in Sweepstakes in the mid 80s.
The early 80s featured the in
troduction of the three-wheel bug
gies as the dominant breed. Leg
end, from Pi Lambda Phi, was 
one of the earliest. It was not 
from one ofthe major buggy orga
nizations, so it never finished in a 
winning position.
Lemur from Sigma Nu was the 
first of the three wheelers to win 
the race. That was back in 1982. 
Since then all organizations have 
gone over to three-wheelers.
That is, except for the flirtation 
with two-wheel designs which 
was practiced by Delta Upsilon 
throughout the 80s.This was a 
tumultuous history 
which featured bug
gies falling over and 
not finishing the race.
The history of twowheelers culminated 
in 1988 when Delta 
Upsilons King Eider 
turned in a 2:08 course 
time the first day only 
to fall over shortly af
ter the hill two pushoff 
the second day. After 
this display the rules 
were changed to dis
allow the design due 
to inherent safety and 
stability problems.
The advent of com
posites such as fiber
glass and kevlar have 
done a great deal to 
make the buggies 
much lighter. Their weight has 
dropped from over 70 pounds 15 
years ago to some organizations 
having buggies weighing in well 
under 30 pounds (this is sans 
driver of course).
Of course the other aspect of 
buggy technology is tires, which 
is easily the topic on which orga
nizations are the most tight 
lipped. This is due to the simple 
fact that fast tires mean a fast 
buggy. One now has to wonder as 
to the future of buggy designs. 
There seem to be two schools 
which are in eminence at the 
moment. There is the one wheel
in front as in the Spirit design. It 
is merely an evolutionary pro
gression towards the more aero
dynamic design of the standard 
one-wheel-in-front buggy.
Spirits adoption (they were pio
neered by other organizations) of 
wheel farings is part of this aero
dynamic consideration. This is a 
straightforward adaptation ofthe 
design originated in Legend. For 
this reason Ill refer to these as 
Legend style.
The other advanced design is 
the two-wheels-in-front, com
pletely enclosed teardrop design. 
Two wheels in front buggies have 
been around for quite a while, 
with examples from SDC, Fringe, 
Phi Kappa Theta, CIA, and Pio
neers.
The Fringe example, Lunatic, 
was completely enclosed in a shell 
and possibly inspired Sigma Nus 
Jama, which was the first of this 
type to make the top five, with a 
third place finish in 1990. Since 
Fringe dismantled Lunatic to 
make it Legend style, I will refer 
to these buggies as Jama style.
Spirit has had their design imi
tated by many organizations in
cluding Phi Kappa Theta and 
SDC. Spirit first stunned observ
ers with a course record of 2:06.2 
with Quantum Leap in 1988, in
troducing this design.
Phi Kappa Theta managed to 
come in second last year with 
their entry, showing what is likely 
to evolve into a solid position as 
one of the top buggy organiza
tions. Sigma Nu exhibited a 
strong showing capturing fourth 
and fifth place with two of its 
Jama -style buggies. Pi Kappa 
Alpha won last years Sweep
stakes with a buggy of the Jama 
type. Delta Upsilon has also made 
a buggy of this design. Rumor 
has it that more organizations 
will be making Jama style bug
gies, but that remains to be seen.

DIVERSIONS
______________ ___________The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania3 April 1995Entertainers, rides add to this weeks festivities
gy PAUL TABACHNECK
fartan Diversions Editor
For many years, Spring Carnival has been a 
tradition at Carnegie Mellon University. Its effect 
on the Greek system is apparent; fraternities work 
on their buggies from the beginning of the semes
ter until two minutes before the final roll, and 
many a 4-foot freshman girl 
has the fond memory of a bunch 
of frat guys chasing her down
beg her to be a human mis
sile for them (See the buggy 
article on page LI).
But theres more to Carnival 
than the buggies and booths  
the entertainment aspect is one 
of the main attractions of 
Spring Carnival, possibly thr 
one that attracts such a wide 
range of people from across the 
city and brings a lot of the stu
dents out of their dorm rooms.
Music
This year, because of the de
struction of Skibo Hall, things 
are going a little different. The 
Midway is now located in the 
Morewood parking lot, and in
stead of playing on the Cut, 
most of the bands will be per
forming on the Drill Deck (Yo 
La Tengo will still set up on the 
Cut).
This has its advantages and disadvantages; if it 
rains, the bands are lucky to have a performance 
space where they can finish out the set (which, as 
last years patrons may recall, Belly did not get to 
do).
However, the only concert I recall in the Drill 
Deck (independent folk-rock group Settie played 
there last semester) was rudely interrupted by the 
Student Centers notoriously obnoxious fire alarms, 
which forced the band and audience to stand out
side while campus police tried to figure out in 
which sector of the building a cigarette was lit.
The list of musical guests goes on and on, as the 
local scene is represented in a better way than Ive 
seen on this campus in years. On Thursday, we can 
look forward to a performance from both Franken
stein (brought to you by your friends at SDC) and 
Squonk Opera (courtesy of AB Coffeehouse), two of 
Carnegie Mellons own 
bands, both of whom did 
highlight sets at the Beaux 
Arts Ball earlier this semes
ter.
Frankensteins style of 
heavy fusion blends a 
punk undertow with an ac
cessible pop feel, with a little 
funk thrown in to make the 
mix sweeter. Squonk Opera 
(who, apparently, have 
killed off their pseudonym 
MegaSquonk) are notori
ous for their elaborate stage 
designs and bizarre tunes; 
if King Missile, Ween, and 
Gwar were to somehow have 
a child, this would be it.
On Friday, look for per
formances by pop/rock 
group Lava, as well as a 
return engagement by 
acoustic folkie Roger Gillen 
(Gillen played at last years 
Carnival, as did Franken
stein). Also, sets will be per
formed by a cappella group Distinguished Gentle
men, and Blogurt, Pittsburghs finest satirical band 
to date. Continuing through the afternoon, we will 
also see Stitch (who also played Beaux Arts), who 
describes their style as hard-hitting rock with soft 
melodic overtones, and Latin dance group 
Orquestra Tropical.
Finally, on Saturday, we finish Carnival out 
with the traditional Kiltie Band performance, as 
well as an engagement with the Carnegie Mellon
Lordly and Dame, Inc 
Billy West, the current voice of both Ren 
and Stimpy, will be lecturing on Thursday 
night, courtesy of AB.
University Giants of Jazz Ensemble. Also in that 
afternoon, Yo La Tengo will take the main stage 
and give CMU a taste of its punk-grunge-meetsSonic-Youth stylings.
Comedy
Every year, we are treated to 
a couple of comic acts, and 1995 
is no exception. On Thursday,
Taylor Mason, who performs 
with a mixture of comedy, mu
sic, and ventriloquism, will 
have a stay in the tent. Could 
this be the last remaining 
vaudevillian? Friday night,
Camival-goers will be treated 
to the humor of Mark Britten.
To wrap it up, Saturday 
evening will feature an 
Evening of Comedy, thanks 
to comedy troupe Selected Hi
larity and comedienne Cathy 
Ladman.
Miscellaneous Highlights
Get ready for a treat, CMU!
Billy West, the voice behind 
Ren and Stimpy, that crazy 
chihuahua and cat team, will 
be speaking on Thursday in 
the Tent, courtesy of AB Lectures! Wests work as 
both animals can be heard on the You Eediot album 
release, as well as later episodes of Nickelodeons 
Ren and Stimpy Showt and his voice as Stimpy is 
heard from the beginning of the first season (Cre
ator John Kricfalusi did the voice of Ren for the 
first few seasons; West took over the role when 
Kricfalusi was ousted from the show). Also on 
Thursday will be a performance entitled Ijits: a 
cornucopia o music and fun.
Many students look forward to the annual Scotch 
n Soda Spring Carnival Musical. This year, the 
offering is that of Lucky Stiff, a musical comedy 
about a fortune, an heir, a short-sighted extortion
ist lover, and a corpse that needs to be laid to rest
in Monte Carlo before his will can be executed.
And, of course, there will be rides. At press time, 
a description of all of these structures could not be 
found, but we can tell you that there will be at least 
five kiddie rides, including a train and a dragon 
roller coaster. 
Also, the pirate 
ship (a large 
wooden craft 
which moves in 
a sickening ver
tical arc) will 
return, as well 
as the gravitron 
(aka vomitron, a huge 
centrifuge 
which literally 
drops the floor 
from under
neath its vic
tims). There 
will definitely 
beaferriswheel 
of some sort, and 
something 
nailed the Ring 
of Fire. And, 
naturally, there 
will be the traGiant Sucking Sound Blogurt, one of Pittsburgh's finest sources of satirical 
music, will play on the Drill Deck this Friday. For more 
information, check the Carnival Supplement.
ditional bumper cars.
All in all, the Spring Carnival looks like it will be 
a success; the entertainment is eclectic (and, for 
the most part, inside), and there are more rides 
planned than we had last year. Once again, the 
campus has planned an event which will entertain 
us without breaking our budgets. My suggestion? 
Save $20 for rides, booths, and funnel cakes (mmm 
... funnel cakes), and see as many bands as you can. 
And above all, enjoy yourself! We have to do our 
homework on Sunday, and finals are coming up.
Exact times and locations can be found in the 
Carnival Supplement, inserted in this publication. 
Enjoy the Carnival, everyone!
Gump grabs box of Oscars at 1995 Academy Awards
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
They say that to be nominated is just as good as winning, but at the 
67th Annual Academy Awards, there was plenty of competition and 
only a handful of winners. Hosted by David Letterman, and tele
vised live to over 50 countries on Monday night, the Oscars were 
filled with humor and some bitter3ss, but all in good fun.
In this article, Ill be giving you 
my opinion on the Oscar ceremony, 
and why I think that handful of 
people won. Keep in mind that any 
mention of Runner Up is my opin
ion on who I think would have won 
had the actual winner suffered a 
fatal car accident the day before the 
ballot closed. The following list is in 
order of the list found on the Internet 
at http://guide.oscars.org/.
Best Achievement in Art Direc
tion
Bullets Over Broadway 
Forrest Gump
Interview With the Vampire 
Legends of the Fall 
The Madness of King George 
Winner: The Madness of King 
George. Well, I didnt see the movie, 
but based on the 10 second clip they 
showed us during the telecast, it 
looked quite pretty.
Best Achievement in Cinematography
Forrest Gump 
Legends of the Fall 
Red
cfdlh!nr t>e!htn mf wehNn' Eenr
Walt Disney entertainment 
Disney also got its Lion's share, taking Oscars for 
both the Hanz Zimmer score and the Elton John/Tim 
Rice tunes.
The Shawshank Redemption 
Wyatt Earp
Winner: Legends of the Fall. The incredible artistry of this film 
made it a wonderful treat for the eye. Or maybe that was just Julia 
Ormond.
Best Achievement in Costume Design
The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert 
Bullets Over Broadway 
Little Women 
Maverick 
Queen Margot
Winner: The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen 
of the Desert. Wow. This film (about a bunch 
of transvestites in Australia) had the most 
incredible costumes, based on the 10 second 
film clip.
Heck, even one of the designers accepting 
the award was wearing a dress made out of 
American Express Credit Cards. (After the 
commercial break, David Letterman com
mented that her dress had just expired.) 
Best Achievement in Film Editing 
Forrest Gump 
Hoop Dreams 
Pulp Fiction
The Shaw-shank Redemption 
Speed
Winner: Forrest Gump. Since they did a 
great job putting that long movie together, I 
guess the people who had to sit there and go 
through every single scene over and over again 
deserve something for it.
Runner-Up: Speed. Talk about adrenaline. Wow. Pity it didnt 
win, though.
Best Achievement in Makeup
Ed Wood
Forrest Gump
Mary Shelleys Frankenstein
Winner: Ed Wood. Having never seen Martin Landau before this 
film, I was surprised to see what he really looked like. A well done, 
job, if I dont'say so myself.
Runner-Up: Forrest Gump. Come on! How much makeup does 
it take to make Tom Hanks look like an idiot? Seriously, the wigs and 
makeup used were wonderful in recreating the 60s, 70s and 80s. 
Best Achievement in Music (Original Score)
Forrest Gump  Alan Silvestri 
Interview With the Vampire  Elliot Goldenthal 
The Lion King  Hans Zimmer 
Little Women  Thomas Newman 
The Shawshank Redemption  Thomas Newman 
Winner: The Lion King. No surprise, considering Disney has won 
this category every year that theyve released a full-featured anima
tion film since The Little Mermaid.
Best Achievement in Music (Original Song)
Can You Feel the Love Tonight from The Lion King (Music by 
Elton John, Lyrics by Tim Rice)
Circle of Life from The Lion King (Music by Elton John, Lyrics by 
Tim Rice)
Hakuna Matata from The Lion King (Music by Elton John, 
Lyrics by Tim Rice)
Look What Love Has Done from Junior (Music and Lyrics by 
Carol Bayer Sager, James Newton Howard, James Ingram and 
Patty Smyth)
Make Up Your Mind from The Paper (Music and Lyrics by Randy 
Newman)
Winner: Can You Feel the Love Tonight. Once again, Disney 
wins. Has it ever lost? As for Look What Love Has Done, you have 
such musical stars as James Newton Howard, Patty Smyth, etc., and 
I bet you cant even'hum a few bars of the song.
Best Achievement in Visual Effects 
Forrest Gump

If you hadnt already heard,

best picture. But that kind of ac

after a million B-movies, he's

memorable performances. 
Bachelor Party
Fresh from his starring role on 
the classic TV staple Bosom Bud
dies, Hanks took a shot at the big
screen with this gem.
Toms getting married to Tawny 
Kitaen, so its time for a bawdy, 
rip-roaring bachelor party with 
pal Adrian Zmed. You can be sure 
theres plenty of excessive sexual 
overtones, and the laughs dont 
start! This is a great movie to 
watchas the last movie in any 
marathon. And, hey, its got 
Adrian Zmed! You cant lose!
The Man With One Red Shoe
No discussion of Tom Hanks 
flicks would be complete without 
at least mentioning this-classia. 
Hanks, a world-class violinist, is 
mistaken for a spy after buddy 
Jim Belushi jokingly leaves Tom 
with a mismatched pair of shoes.
From then on, its wacky non

Dabney Coleman, rifle through

Yo La Tengo misses the mark
By DAVID KORAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Artist: Yo La Tengo
Album: Electr-O-Pura
I was originally supposed to investigate why 
we didnt have a big-name band for this coming 
weekends Carnival until I got a message re
garding this band. Immediately, I went looking 
for some background material atthe local stores, 
going through the little unregarded sections of 
the alphabet in search of their possible other 
albums, with mixed success. I then came back to 
preview the promowe.or rather AB, received for 
this band, and boy, waB I shocked. I guess as the 
saying goes, beggars cant be choosers, and since 
we went through top names such as Toad the 
Wet Sprocket, Sonic Youth, Luscious Jackson, 
and our hometown favorite Rusted Root, I 
figured that we were close to, if not already at, 
the end of our choices, and I was right.
The group is fresh out of the studio, just
releasing Electr-O-Pura as a sequel to their 1993 
album Painful. They soundlike a garage band, and 
although I cant vouch personally for their origins, 
the new album doesnt sound like theyve overcome 
the well-known [at least in the recording industry I 
sophomore blues.
They do make an honest effort to crank up the 
musicianhip on this album, but most of the guitar 
riffs and other instumentals are very muddy, and 
the lyrics are virtually intelligible.
One noticeable stylistic trend is an instrumental 
fade-in which, if you have any background in Beatles 
music, sounds like a modem version of a clip from 
Revolution #9 [The Beatles (aka The White 
Album)] and could be foreshadowing the groups 
track Paul Is Dead. The music isnt very upbeat, 
and it ends up sounding like they went to the studio 
drunk or asleep [once again I cant vouch for their 
state during the studio session].
Instrumentally they sound like Mazzy Star 
wanna-bes, lyrically like no one Ive ever heard, 
thankfully. I would like to say nice try, but come 
Saturday, I would hope for rain.

Gump sweeps Academy Awards; Hoop Dreams gets shafted
OSCARS, from page L7
The Mask 
True Lies
Winner: Forrest Gump. If I had my way, Id give 
the Oscar to all three. But Gump definitely had the 
best effects. For removing Gary Sineses legs, and 
having Gump meet three Presidents, Forrest Gump 
certainly deserved the Oscar.
Best Screenplay Written Directly for the 
Screen 
Bullets Over Broadway 
Four Weddings and a Funeral 
Heavenly Creatures 
Pulp Fiction 
Red
Winner: Sadly, this is the only Oscar that Pulp 
Fiction won. It probably deserved more than this, 
but as Quentin Tarantino said when he accepted 
the award, this is all Im going to get.
Best Screenplay Based on Material Previ
ously Produced or Published 
Forrest Gump
The Madness of King George 
Nobodys Fool 
' Quiz Show
 The Shawshank Redemption 
. Winner: Forrest Gump. The script was legible. 
The book was not. I happened to look at Winston 
Grooms book while in a Waldenbooks a few months 
ago. The whole thing was written like Forrest 
talks.
That is not how I want to spend a couple of hours, 
but the content is what counts, and once again, 
Gump got what it deserved.
Best Performance by an Actor in a Support
ing Role
Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction 
Martin Landau in Ed Wood 
Chazz Palminteri in Bullets Over Broadway 
Paul Scofield in Quiz Show 
Gary Sinise in Forrest Gump 
Winner: Martin Landau played an over-the-hill, 
drug-using, alcoholic actor, which most of the mem
bers of the Academy can relate to. The role was also 
done nicely.
Runner-Up: Samuel L. Jackson would have 
gotten the Oscar for his very powerful role in Pulp 
Fiction, but since most members of the Academy 
arent hit-men, they just didnt relate to it.
Best Performance by an Actress in a Support
ing Role 
Rosemary Harris in Tom & Viv 
Helen Mirren in The Madness of King George 
Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction 
Jennifer Tilly in Bullets Over Broadway 
Dianne Wiest in Bullets Over Broadway 
Winner: Dianne Wiest played an over-the-hill, 
drug-using, alcoholic actor, which most of the mem
bers of the Academy can relate to. And the role was 
also done nicely.
Runner-Up: Uma Thurman had a decent chance 
of winning, but the members of the Academy prob
ably arent too keen on having adrenaline injected 
into their hearts.
Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading 
Role
Jodie Foster in Nell 
Jessica Lange in Blue Sky
Miranda Richardson in Tom & Viv 
Winona Ryder in Little Women 
Susan Sarandon in The Client 
Winner: Jessica Lange won, which is sort of odd, 
yet I felt that she would win regardless.
It could be one of those sympathyvote things, but 
since I didnt see Blue Sky, I really cant make a 
decision.
Runner-Up: Jodie Foster should have won for 
Nell. I mean, if they gave the Oscar to Holly 
Hunter last year for playing a mute, the least they 
could do is give it to Foster for singing gibberish. 
But Foster already has a few Oscars, and Lange 
doesnt have as many.
Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading 
Role
Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemp
tion
Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump 
Nigel Hawthorne in The Madness of King George 
Paul Newman in Nobodys Fool 
John Travolta in Pulp Fiction 
Winner: Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar for his 
portrayal of Forrest Gump, but it is a bit odd for 
him to win, considering he won last year for Phila
delphia. He is also the first actor to win two Oscars 
in the Best Actor category since Spencer Tracey in 
the late 1930s.
Runner-Up: John Travolta had a good shot, but 
ever since Look Whos Talking Now, it just hasnt 
been his time. But, expect more serious roles for 
him in the near future.
Best Achievement in Directing 
Bullets Over Broadway  Woody Allen
Forrest Gump  Robert Zemeckis 
Pulp Fiction  Quentin Tarantino 
Quiz Show  Robert Redford 
Red  Krzysztof Kieslowski 
Winner: Robert Zemeckis, for Forrest Gutnp 
Allen is still immersed in controversy over that 
whole Mia Farrow thing; Tarantino is too new and 
violent; Redford already got one for Ordinary People 
and no one can pronounce Kieslowskis name.
So Zemeckis gets it, not just because of the abovi 
reasons, but also because he did a good job. (Also 
it doesnt seem right for a film to win Best Pictur< 
and the Director not to win as well.)
Best Picture of the Year 
Forrest Gump
Four Weddings and a Funeral 
Pulp Fiction 
Quiz Show
The Shawshank Redemption 
Winner: Forrest Gump. A movie that parent! 
can take their kids to see, Gump won because ofita 
humanity, and because of those really cool special 
effects.
Runner-Up: Pulp Fiction. This film is too cool 
to miss seeing, and its a shame the Academy didnt 
give it what it deserved. But it did win at the 
Cannes Film Festival, so whos complaining?
Overall, this was not a bad ceremony. Ther< 
werent a lot of surprises. Hugh Grant was a bit 
upset over not being nominated for Best Actor (and 
he didnt hesitate to mention so), and Hoop Dream 
got shunned big time.
But Letterman was funny, the musical routine 
was cheesy as always, and the speeches ran too 
long. All in all, not bad for 1994.

Turner and Hooch
Back before people were trying to Free 
Willy and getting into all sorts of Mon
key Trouble, Hollywood was making do 
with mans best friend. Jim Belushi 
made K-9, television had Rin-Tin-Tin 
K9 Cop as well as The New Adventures 
of Lassie, and Tom ended up in Turner 
and Hooch.
Toms a cop, and his new partners a 
filthy mutt. Although both the Mis
matched Cops and the Cute Fuzzy 
Animal genres are overdone, this was 
the first time they had been combined 
into one film. Its Lethal Weapon meets
Hanks achievment as da Gump is 
incredible, especially when you look at 
his past projects.
Old Yellerenough said. And hey, lets 
not forget the medium-speed car chase: 
definitely a first!
Mazes and Monsters 
Remember the good old days, when 
every parents group wanted to banDungeons and Dragons'?
Well, this made-for-TV flick explores 
the question: What would happen if 
Tom Hanks were a D&D-type roleplayer 
who ran around in the sewers, and fi
nally lost his mind believing himself to 
be in a medieval world?
Its good anti-D&D propaganda. You 
may even be lucky enough to find the 
subtitled version, Rona Jaffees Mazes 
and Monsters, although I have no idea 
who Rona Jaffee is.
Joe vs. the Volcano
If you ever wanted to see Tom as a 
terminally ill character, but Philadel
phia is too sad for your liking, try this

Whatever Happened to Baby 
Jane?
You know, I dont think its fair to all the other 
rooms that DH2210 gets all the attention. So, for a 
little something different, well see whats going on 
in the Drill Deck. The nice lady on the phone, up at 
the Information Desk, told me that there was a 
tango, something with SDC in it, and some more 
crazy tango stuff later on. Pretty hep, if you askme. 
So anyway.
Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is about James 
Taylors addiction to stuff that makes him really 
mellow. No, thats Baby James. This one stars 
Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as sisters who are 
kind ofwacked out. See, it goes something like this: 
Davis is a cripple and Crawford is a mean kitten, 
and they just mess with each other in a fairly scary 
way. I was made in 1961 and is a bit over-the-top 
but interesting enough to warrant a look see. Adult 
material, adult situations, adult language. Morally 
objectionable.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
Friday, April 7
Stand By Me
Another of a long line of Stephen King docudramas, youve probably already seen this movie 
and kind of enjoyed the puking parts and the part 
where he takes a leech off of his pants monkey. 
Stand By Me stars River Pheonix, that kid from 
Star Trek, Corey Haim, and this chubby kid who 
went on to work at Kentucky Fried Chicken be
cause I havent seen him since.
This is all about these four kids who go hiking in 
search of clean air, good times, and a bloated, dead 
body. They travel from their little clubhouse out to 
these railroad tracks where they fight Pheonixs 
older brother over who gets to sell the story to the 
news. Theres a lot of nice moments, like the stories 
the Star Trek kid tells and the time the Star Trek 
kid meets a deer. It also stars Richard Dreyfuss and 
was directed by Rob Meathead Reiner. Adult 
language, dead, bloated bodies. Morally objection
able.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

20th Annual Tournee of Ani
mation
This is a movie that has a lot of little moving 
picture shows in it, kind of like Mickey Mouse on 
crack or a Tenness6 Williams play done by a troupe 
of horses. There will be very interesting animations 
in this animation tournee, which roughly trans
lates to something in French.
Im sure itll be very interesting and something 
fun to see. Ive seen quite a few of these, and theyre 
a mish-mash of computer animation and regular 
art that is really nice and has a picquant flavor, like 
chives.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Reefer Madness
Ahh, there, now thats better.
So, Reefer Madness, huh. Theres got to be some 
law that says this has to be shown on every campus, 
over and over again, at least bi-yearly. Oh well.
This touching portrayal of a young man and his 
doobies is one of the most heart-warming and frank 
discussions on smoking pot one could hope for. Full 
of fine 50s acceptance and tolerance, this movie 
follows the characters through the ups and downs, 
the trials and troubles, and the loves and hates of 
recreational drug use. Dont apply for a job for at 
least three months after seeing this movie. Drug 
use, reefer toking, and adult situations. The boys 
alright, the boys out of sight.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Belly makes strong comeback with King
By DAVID KORAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Artist: Belly 
Album: King
Well, our band from last year 
just hit the big time with this one, 
making the cover of every repu
table pop music magazine in the 
country. There is a reason for
the disc resides at the end, fol
lowing the old wives tail of saving 
the best for last.
Judas My Heart presents it
self as a relatively melodic song 
about living not so well among 
todays society. Not to give any 
real deep meaning-to. 
the; song,T jxlst think
bum they stuck with one roster, 
which contains Tanya Donelly 
(vocals and guitar), Chris Gor
man (drums), Tom Gorman (gui
tar and piano), and their newest 
member, bassist Gail Greenwood.
Like their previous 1993 release 
Star, the melodic lyrics still have 
their dark and mysterious over
tones. The musicianship on ,tMs it sounds cool. Another 
album has increased;at lst tenitem on this tantaliz 
fold and each, track on the 
disc which has been re
leased on cassette for the 
Stone Agers (and cryptic

There are certain songs 
on this disc that^ how do

release or a video. You can 
tell that some of them were 
favorites. Since we were a
the single which has them being 
their own roadies, which they al
most were in their visit to us last 
year.
Belly has released a total of two 
albums and three singles, all of 
which are available through any
ing disc, for me at least 
is The Bees. The 
songs all about friends 
and the nasty little 
things they do to each 
other, but once iagain, 
the musicians skills 
stand out above all, 
with neat little guitar 
techniques that make 
this song go beyond:

Bye Bye, Love should be Bye Bye, Plausibility
By DAWN WALLHAUSEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Movie: Bye Bye, Love
Starring: Paul Reiser, Matthew Modine, Randy Quaid
Bye Bye, Love is about three men who are divorced... with children. 
The guys relationships with their ex-wives vary 
in degrees from love to hatred, and their rela
tionships with their children vary from slightly 
complex to nearly non-existent.
Paul Reiser plays the typical good guy; still 
in love with the wife who left him, trying desper
ately to mend the rift between himself and his 
daughter. Matthew Modine stars as a womanizingDon Juan type who loves his children, maybe 
even loves his ex-wife a bit, but cant seem to 
grow up. Finally, Randy Quaid gives us a char
acter who thoroughly despises his ex-wife (and 
purports to dislike most women), but who has an 
almost idyllic rapport with his children.
Rich and I went to this picture together, in
tending to review it together as we would nor
mally. However, after watching the movie, he no longer wanted to be 
responsible for what was said about it in this review. He hated it that 
much.
As for me, I didnt exactly hate itit had its good aspects and bad 
aspects. Its definitely a film that you must watch as an innocuous bit 
of diversion, not even remotely as serious cinema. In fact, I thought 
it was okay, pretty much, until I really thought about it. When I sat 
down to figure out how I would comment on it in this review, I became 
aware of some holes in the plot the size of Pittsburgh.
One serious flaw in the plot revolves around the fact that the whole 
film is supposed to take place over a period of 48 hours. The time 
frame was not made abundantly clear, but on reflection, the talk 
radio psychologist/disc jockey (Rob Meathead Reiner) who appears
early in the film says For the next 48 hours, well be talking about 
divorce ....Then, he shows up time and again throughout the movfe, 
taking callers and offering advice (read: screaming at them) on the 
topic.
Once that was clear to me, I thought it rather ridiculous that in 
that short time span, the good guy dad would finally give up on 
getting his ex-wife back and find another lover  and for that 
matter, find that lover in his buddys ex-wife. 
Also in that time, the good guy repairs the 
problems separating him from his daughter, 
the Don Juan grows up and commits, and the 
woman-hater falls for a flaky-but-strong 
woman; oh, and he becomes an on-air per
sonality with the pop psychology DJ, too. If I 
could change my life in 48 hours as much as 
any of these characters, youd find me living 
on a mountain in Montana eating berries 
and writing poetry for a living by Wednes
day.
Richs objection to the movie was the theme. 
I believe he said something like, We need.a 
film in the 90s to tell us that divorce is 
difficult?!?!? He went on to say that I probDean a
(L to R): Randy Quaid, Paul Reiser, and 
Matthew Modine star in Bye Bye, Love, a 
comedy about divorce in the 90s.
ably didnt despise it as much as he did because I come from a home 
where the parents are still together. I dont know how much that 
actually has to do with it, but thats not the point anyway. I digress.
I should point out that the aforementioned flake, played by Janine 
Gorofolo, went a long way towards saving this movie. She was 
hysterically funnyRichard the cynic agrees with me on that point. 
Surprisingly, her character has a certain chemistry with Quaids. 
This was a good thing to me, since Quaid played the character I liked 
most out of the three men.
To sum up my feelings on this movie, Id like to quote a friend who 
said, If youre going to see this movie, leave your brain at home. 
True enough: if you dont think too much about this movie, you might 
enjoy it. It is the not-quite-as-funny Parenthood of the 90s.

ANCIENT CHINESE SECRETS
By Ido Ben-Shachar 
and Aaron Weisberg
This week we will be discussing Chinese food, 
and how it relates to your digestive process. We 
begin by examining th
Emergency! Emergency! We interrupt our nor
mally scheduled bull to bring you this important 
public announcement. As you may well know, 
recent floods in California have destroyed a 
large portion of this years broccoli crop. This is 
not a test. Broccoli prices have tripled over the 
past few weeks, and the catastrophic effects are 
already being felt nationwide.
What does this mean to American Chinese 
food consumers? Well, we see three possible 
scenarios: first, it is quite possible that prices at 
Chinese restaurants will simply go up; second, 
certain establishments may decide to simply use 
less broccoli in their entrees; and finally, there is 
a slim chance that Combinations Number Three, 
Four, and 11 will simply no longer be available 
at Yum Wok. (We shiver in fear...)
Dont panic! We have begun an in-depth inves
tigation into local Chinese restaurants, asking 
them about the broccoli issue. An anonymous 
source, China Palace, told us, This is only tem
porary. We do not plan on changing broccoli-dish 
prices. They also assured us that they would 
use the same amount of broccoli in their dishes 
as they normally use.
Other restaurants in the area gave us 
similar responses. It seems that Pittsburgh 
will be saved the agony of such dishes as 
Beef with Parsley and Sauteed alfalfa 
with garlic sauce. We now return you to 
your normally scheduled bull.
 And so, we told the guy that if he 
thought the toilet would flush, he was crazy! 
And so we conclude the dramatic tale of 
Chinese food and your digestive process.
This week, we decided to order Silk Pa
goda (4070 Beechwood Boulevard, 521-8620) 
delivery, rather than go to a restaurant. 
With vacation just over, and cruel teachers 
assigning work due right after break, the 
time just couldnt be found to go out.
After ordering our food, we had only to 
wait 35 minutes until it arrived. This is 
about as fast as pizza, but not quite as fast as 
Ramen Noodles. Needless to say, we had 
Ramen Noodles while waiting for the food.
Something that every Carnegie Mellon 
student should know about Silk Pagoda is 
their GREAT CMU specials. For $5.75, you 
can get a dinner which includes a soup, rice, 
an eggroll, and your choice of 21 entrees. 
And of course, a fortune cookie!
The wonton soup is a bit salty. The broth 
is mostly just water, but what do you expect 
for $5.75? Nevertheless, its edible.
Actually, this reminds us of a story about 
one of Silk Pagodas soups. Several months 
ago, an anonymous friend of ours and his 
anonymous friend discovered that Silk 
Pagodas hot and sour soup lacked one key 
quality: that edibility thing. It also bears a 
striking resemblance to hurl. (Boy do we 
hope this isnt slander). Determined to get 
the most for their money, and needing to 
empty the soup containers, these two stu
dents lit upon a creative idea: Make a loud
hurling noise and pour the soup out a high 
window. Hours of joy.
Anyway, the Silk Pagoda dinner also 
comes with an eggroll. As our friend Mike 
puts it, The only good thing about the 
eggroll is the outside. That about covers 
it.
We ordered General Tsos chicken and 
Hunan beef. The Tsos is by far the best 
dish at Silk Pagoda. Depending on the 
position of the stars, they sometimes make 
this dish spicy, and other times dont. So 
be sure to tell them exactly how spicy you 
want it if you care.
Their sauce is actually quite good, and 
although a bit thick, it does the job. Tliey 
dont use the best chicken available, but 
again, what do you expect for $5.75? Dont 
get us wrong, its definitely worth the 
price.
Now a strange thing happened. I or
dered Hunan beef, but the tray I got from 
them was clearly labeled Human beef. I 
was disturbed at first, but realized it was 
probably just a typo. I was a bit wary when 
I first tasted it, but hey, it tastes like 
chicken! (Sorry for that joke ...)
The Tso was good, the soup containers 
are reusable, and soup comes with crunchy 
noodles. What else could you want for 
$5.75? We realize that many students al
ready order Silk Pagoda, and hope that 
many do in the future. Its a good deal. We 
give Silk Pagoda 2.5 Tsos out of 5.
Fortune of the week: You will fail; in 
everything you attempt. Lucky numbers: 
13, 666, 687-7777.
So where are we going next week?! An
cient Chinese secret!

Spring Carnival 1995  A Few

---------------------------------------------------

Carnival Committee Focus
SPRING CARNIVAL 95 ENTERTAINMENT INFOZINE
From the Carnival Chair
Well, its here yet again! Soon, another Spring Carnival will be 
gone, and well all be hitting the books again. Every Carnival is 
different, but what sets this one apart is the move from outside 
of Skibo to the Morewood Gardens Parking Lot. We are ex
tremely fortunate in that not only has this move allowed us to 
continue offering the Midway entertainment and rides that have 
been so popular in the past, but weve been able to expand to 
bring in bigger and better entertainment, more rides and even 
more booth building organizations.
The move to Morewood brought with it its share of 
challenges. The sites close proximity to both the Devonshire 
Road neighbors and the Morewood Gardens Residence Hall nec
essarily brought several changes in our procedures. As a cour
tesy to the folks that live, eat and sleep within earshot of the 
Midway, organizations will not permitted round-the-clock con
struction; late at night, only quiet construction was permitted 
so there was minimal disruption to the community. The restricted 
construction hours prompted us to allow organizations three ex
tra days to build their booths. This, of course means that from 
April 3 through April 7, we will be displacing cars from the 
parking lot. These cars will be redistributed throughout the rest 
of the Morewood Gardens Lot and on the roof of the Parking 
Garage by a local valet parking company. We hope this ap
proach to solving our parking problems will minimize the in
convenience to the permit holders in these parking areas. We 
truly appreciate everyones cooperation on this matter.
Though Carnival itself will be exciting, I cant forget 
all of the people who helped pull this off. First and foremost is 
the Spring Carnival Committee itself. Without the support and 
dedication of all of the committees, Carnival never would have 
happened. Special thanks goes to Howard Meisner, Becca 
Albrecht, Suri, Dan Lim, Sushen Gupta, Jill Goodall, Christa 
Sherwood, and Peter Weiland (committee heads), as well as their 
assistants for all of the work they have done.
People too numerous to recount, ranging from Student 
Affairs, to Facilities Management Services, to the Parking Of
fice have all helped us in more ways than I ever dreamed pos
sible. Without these people, Carnival would not be here.
Now, join me in an adventure into the world of car
toons! In this tabloid, youll find activities to keep you busy 
throughout all of Carnival weekend! So enjoy!

Entranceway Co-chair Jenna 
Yerger, Entranceway Co-chair 
Christa Sherwood 
This years Carnival includes a 
comeback of an old tradition. Back 
in the days before the New Dorms 
and Gesling Stadium were built, 
Carnival was held in an IM field 
(now Gesling Stadium). There was 
only one entrance to Carnival, 
known as the Entranceway, which 
was usually celebrated by a ban
ner, arch, or gateway under which 
people could walk. Spring Carni
val 1995 will once again have an 
Entranceway, and it will be better 
than ever with a few interesting ad
ditions!
As Entranceway Co
chairs, we had nothing to begin 
with except for a few old photo
graphs and hazy memories of what 
the Entranceway once was. So we 
began anew with the idea of a 
simple, yet eye-catching 
Entranceway that could be used 
again next year. One of the most 
exciting things that we have added 
are three neon faces which will be 
suspended from the Entranceway. 
These abstract cartoon heads will 
be raffled off at the end of Carni
val (so buy your raffle tickets now 
for only $1!). So as you step into 
the wild world of cartoons, take a 
look above you!

ing from Scotts technical, theory-based style, to Anns foundation in 
hard rock, to the chunky, bittersweet style of Andy. The three come 
together to form powerful, hard-hitting rock with melodic overtones

contrasting dynamics. And it tastes good, too.
