DECISION TODAY
Before approaching any discussion 
motifs for the annual costume ball 
: the School of Applied Design, a 
nort resume of it_s history, and a 
tatement of its scope and reason for 
)eing, is permissable.
The inception of the idea was at 
he time of the Pageant of the laying 
3f the corner-stonein 1912. This 
;event consisted of a very spectacular 
Diit-door parade of the Peoples of 
1 Earth, bearing appropriate gifts and 
I trophies to be placed in the corneri stone casket of the newest temple of 
'art. The presentation of the gifts 
( took place under a huge tent shelter
ing many invited guests of internai tional repute and concluded with a 
pantonima^ and tableau of inspiring 
beauty and magnitude.
From this auspicious beginning de
veloped the idea of the costume ball 
on lines suggested by the PatVon Mr. 
Henry Hornbostel. In 1913 the Ro
man Ball was given in Architectural 
Draughting room of the newly com
pleted building. This was a rather 
unstudied affair in the matters of both 
decoration and costume, but in it was 
Tiorn a spirit of artistic revelry, an 
abandonment to the Idea of the Night, 
and the thing that signals the dawn of 
esthetic appreciation.
The Oriental Ball of 1914, promoted 
this spirit, and was characterized by 
-the transformation of the foyer and 
corridor into a Selamlik in a red, 
-gold and black decorative scheme. The 
costumes were splendid and showed 
plainly the study and care given in 
their fabrication.
The Medieval Ball followed in 1915, 
and had for its feature The Masque 
of Charlemague, a spectacle deplet
ing the return of the Paladius from the 
Wars in Africa.
Recognizing the ascendant influence 
in modern art, the Slavonic Ball was 
given in 1916, and in the decorations 
were shown the primitive peasant art 
contrasted with a forecast of the 
Slavic art of the future.
It will be seen that a definite idea 
dominated each of these events: The 
decoration of the foyer and corridor, 
the study, planning arid execution of 
the costumes, the seection of the mu
sic and the creation of the atmosphere 
and spirit of the period presented 
problems to be overcome only by careiul study and research. IThe ball, 
-then, becomes a problem in Archaeo
logy, and as such is recognized and 
approved by the school authorities; 
and in it an opportunity is given the 
student body to select a period in art, 
to study it in detail, to become there
by acquainted with its beauties, to 
exercise intelligent and artistic dis'Crimination in adapCng it to the condtions present, and best of allto 
complete the final sc'iemeby student 
craftsmanship.
The selection of r otif for the ball 
-of 1917 presents several problems. The 
military idea is, of course, uppermost 
in all minds. It would seem a good 
thing to break awr. y from all this, 
and consider the calmer realms of 
history and art, yet not losing the pa. triotic impulse. Compatible with this 
is the suggested title. The Ball of 
Historic America.
It is the epitome of history and of 
art: a history datin.r from a few cen
turies after the Great Flood, a geo:graphical extent of r. hemisphere from

INDUSTRIES SECURES BONDS FOR MEMORIAL
FOOTBALL DANCES ARE PROVING SUCCESSFUL
The second in the series of three 
football dances was held with con
siderable success in the Union last 
Saturday evening. The crowd of 
about seventy-five couples was not 
quite so large as in the previous 
week, but that made the actual danc
ing all the better.
The third and last of the series is, 
however, expected to draw an even 
greater attendance than the first, 
since it comes aftei* the important 
Allegheny game. The dances are 
held for the. benefit of the football 
squad by the Athletic Association, 
and consequently deserve all the sup
port possible. Sweeneys orchestra 
has been doing noble work with the 
music.
SECOND TEAM DEFEATED BV ERIE DIGH SCHOOL
Erie High defeated the Tech second 
team six to two at Perry Field, in Erie 
Saturday. The game was played on a 
heavy, 'Slippery field; which impeded 
the work of the lighter Tech eleven. 
Injuries and the lack of substitutes 
contributed to the, defeat. Schmucker 
sustained a severe hip injury in the 
first three minutes of play and was 
forced to retire. Gove who succeeded 
him played gamely through the sec
ond half with a broken nose. Swift 
at fullback for the Scrubs was a con
sistent ground gainer through the line. 
Gove repeatedly skirted the ends for 
substantial gains.
Turner kicked off for' Erie and the 
ball was returned to midfield. Tech 
was unable to make first down, so 
Huggins punted to Erie. Erie was 
held and punted. Schmucker ran the 
ball back ten yards, but was thrown 
hard and injured. Tech was again 
held and Higgins punted. Erie after 
a couple of attempted passes was 
forced to punt. Tech was penalized 
for being offside and Gove relieved 
Schmucker at quarter. Higgins punt
ed and after holding Erie for two 
downs with little gain, Sullivan broke 
away on an end run and went thirty 
yards for a touchdown. The attempt 
to kick goal failed, as the quarter end
ed.
Score: Erie 6, Tech Seconds 0.
The second quarter consisted of 
straight football, neither side being 
able to gain much ground; but the 
Tech team showed stronger. Turner 
kicked off at the beginning of the 
third quarter to the twenty yard line 
and the ball was brought back ten 
yards. Tech was unable to gain and 
Higgins punted. Erie was soon forced, 
to do likewise. Higgins ran around 
right end for nine yards. Anderson 
added another through the line for

Day School, and one from Design 
Night complete this list.
Wednesday, October 17, at the reg
ular weekly assembly the School of 
Applied Industries established her 
/first big tradition in the passage of 
Liberty Loan Memorial. Mr. Baird, 
chairman of the committee on the Lib
erty loan memorial fund, read aloud 
to the assembly the article which ap
peared in last weeks Tartan, stating 
the purpose of the memorial and the 
means whereby it was to be establish
ed. It was passed unanimously. It 
was decided to purchase two one hun
dred dollar bonds to be held in trust 
by the cashier of the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology until the time of 
their maturity, when an assembly | 
will be called to decide on a suitable 
memorial. Even as they passed the 
bill it is doubtful whether the stu
dents of Industry School grasped the 
full significance of what they were 
doing or realized what it would mean 
to the school and Carnegie Tech as 
:as a whole in future generations.

NEW SYSTEM OF PLEBE GOVERNMENT IN DESIGN
At a. meeting of the Senior Class 
of the School of Applied Design Fri
day, October 19, a new system was 
introduced by which Plebes charged 
with violation of the rules, were 
brought up for trial in a more serious 
and dignified manner than has been 
the custom up to the present time. 
Each case was discussed Individually 
and a fair sentence imposed, accord
ing to the offense. The cases were 
then turned over to the Sophomores 
who executed the sentences. The 
main idea of his new system is to 
avoid the unfairness of the former 
horseplay method of trial, and to in
still in the Plebes a feeling of respect 
rather than resentment. It is hoped 
that the under classmen will recognize 
the value of this system and give it 
their support.

ed for Lack Since Open
ing of School
Next weeks football games present 
quite a problem for Tech teams. ^Tlie 
varsity plays Alegheny College at 
home. Allegheny is fortunate in hav
ing five of her men from last year 
again in school, and besides has a 
promising bunch of newcomers. Their | 
team had no difficulty in simple wiping 
up the map With Geneva last Satur
day, and from, all reports they confi
dently expect a victory again this 
week. One of the Pittsburgh sporting 
writers is credited with saying that he 
thinks Tech will be doing very well to 
come out ahead by a close margin.
The second team plays Indiana Normay away from home. The fact that 
twenty men are to be taken on the 
trip should induce more men to report 
for the squad regularly this week. 
Indiana has a wonderrul team this 
year. They held W. & J. to a low 
score, and defeated Bellefonte Acad
emy by over a hundred points.
PLEBE SQUAD STARTS BASKET BALL PRACTICE
Basket ball practice starts for men 
in the Plebe class on Tuesday after
noon at 4:30. The system of hav
ing the Plebes report earlier than 
the upper classmen was very suc
cessful last year, since several of the 
men made the varsity and others of 
course made the Plebe team. There 
is an equally good opportunity this 
year to take the places of the men 
who have-left school, in spite of the 
fact that the basket ball squad is in 
better shape than any other in the 
school. Coach McCulloch will have 
Foxon, Abrams, Gretzler, Carey, Wil
liams and others of last year's squad 
to begin with in addition to the men 
who will be developed from the 
Plebe squad.
GLEE CLUB ORGANIZED BY GIRLS J0RM1T0BY
A Forbes Hall Glee Club has been 
organized with Miss Hilda Cooper as 
director and Miss Helen Black as ac
companist. Fourteen girls*are enroll
ed and the quality of the voices show 
that some spirited chorus work will be 
accomplished. A dormitory orchestra 
is also being organized to accompany 
the Glee Club and the girls are very 
enthusiastic to begin real work.
Forbes Hall is showing Its dormi
tory spirit by the hearty co-operation 
which the girls are giving in all things 
which promote democracy.

COMMONS CLUB GIVES FIRST SMOKER OF YEAR
To start the social ball a rolling for 
the coming year, the Carnegie Chapter 
of the National Federation of Com
mons Clubs held a smoker last Friday 
\night at the house on Murrayhill ave
nue. Cards and music, plus "eats 
and smokes, together with a spirit 
of good fellowship, made a long even
ing pass quickly.
SCIENCE PLEBES PLAN SMOKER FOR NEXT MONTH
Science Plebes are not slow when 
it comes to doing things. A smoker 
is being planned for November 2, and 
success is assured. The Union will 
appear in gala attire when this years 
nev/comers have their first real gettogether. Of course the seniors are 
invited. The evenings entertainment 
is already planned and a wonderful 
headliner will greet the Plebes, and 
others. At this time, no definite speak
ers have been selected. It is assured, 
however, that they will meet the oc
casion.
SENIORS OF DESIGN ELECT CLASS OFFICERS
Design School Senior Class Officers 
were elected as follows:
President, L. C. Smith,
First Vice President, C. C. Pribek, 
Second Vice President. Grace Lysinger,
Secretary, Keorge E. Trent, 
Treasurer, Alex Sharove.
As a result of the numerous com
ments aroused by our bare flag-pole, 
a new American flag was raised on it 
last Wednesday. The raising of the 
flag was due directly to the following 
letter, which was sent by President 
R. T. Soule of the Science School 
Senate, to Director I-Iammerschlag, in 
accordance with a resolution unani
mously adopted by the Science stu
dent body:
Dr. A. A. I-Iamerschlag,
Director C. I. T.
Director I-Iamerschlag:
These are indeed stirring times. 
Evidence of this is brought home to 
every American citizen by the great 
fact that we are engaged in the great
est war for democracy ever known in 
history. The spirit of patriotism and 
loyalty to our flag is being fostered in 
every way possible throughout the 
country.
The schools and collegesof the na
tion should be and are the nuclei of 
patriotic spirit and devotion to the 
country.
in view of this fact it has been 
very noticeable to the student body of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
that the national colors are not dis
played on the campus. In consequence 
the student body of the School of Ap
plied Science has unanimously re
quested the Senate of that school to 
make an appeal to the administration 
of the Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy that a flag be raised on the now 
bare pole on the lawn of the School 
of Applied Design.
It is certainly not in keeping with 
the dignity and prestige of this In
stitution that this should have been

GIRLS OF FORBES HALL APPRECIATE SERENADE
Last week one night, the gills in 
Forbes Hall were startled upon hear
ing some music and singing coming 
from somewhere in front of the house 
at a very late hour.
It was later discovered that there 
were a few fellows, reviving, an II. 
were, the ancient .Qustome of serenad
ing.
After a short program the mysteri
ous musicians disappeared, having re
ceived a shower of apples from one 
of the upper windows.
The girls are anxious lo know who 
the serenaders were and .hope that; 
they will come again at a more ap
propriate hour.
BOND COMMITTEE HAS SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN
Bonds to the amount of $46,550.00 
have been solicited by the M. M. C. S. 
Womens Liberty Loan Committee. 
This is exclusive of the bonds bought 
on the 20 month plan, payable to the 
cashier of the institute.
VIOLATORS OF RULES SUFFER PUNISHMENT
Plebes who violated customs and 
traditions at the Dorms, by the same 
violations breaking Dorm Association 
rules, are examples of those who learn 
by experience. If the Plebe who was 
secured in the stocks one and one-half 
hours Thursday afternoon had been 
permitted to speak during his confine
ment, he would have said that to throw 
ripe things from a window, especially 
at more than a mere Plebe, is very 
unprofitable and uncomfortable.
On the same day, the two men who 
thought that two wrongs make a 
right, made unsurpassably odd statu
ary standing, each on one of the stone 
columns between the dorms. They 
expected tdv break even by stacking 
the room of men whom they suspect
ed, but reports indicate that this also 
is unprofitable business.
On Monday, another room-slacker 
a Soph in this case, suffered his time 
in the pillory. Plebes will note noth
ing partial in these transactions.
But the seriousness of the boards 
that tried these men shows that all 
rules must be lived up to. Obey the 
old customs and traditions of Tech, 
andavoid untimely haircuts.

MILITARY DRILL IS NOW A PLEBE PROJECT
Editors NoteThis subject Is

One class meeting, several section

again put military drill on the map at 
Tech. The drill which was started 
last spring has not been continued 
this^fall. The Science Plebes, aware 
of the necessity of drill in these trying 
times, felt that their greatest duty to 
the country and-the best thing for the 
school wHs in military drill. The en
thusiasm with which the class took up 
the proposal already indicates the suc

Playing Not Up To Standard 
Set By Other Games 
Of Season
SCORE 21-0
Tech defeated the Ohio University 
eleven on Tech Field Saturday 21-0. 
The game was marred by loose and 
unnecessarily rough playing by both 
teams. The tackling was not sure 
and hard, the forward passing below 
par and in interference alone did the 
Tech squad show as well as in the 
previous, games.
But to give credit where due, the 
backfield showed well on the offen
sive. Bloom ran (lie ends and team 
well. Ginn played his usual consist
ent, hard game and Lynn skirted the 
ends well although his punting was 
not up to his capabilities. Gretzler 
manifested his usual propensity for 
breaking up passes. Williams played 
well in spite of his bad log.
For Ohio Fullback Krieger was the 
most dependable ground gainer. His 
punts averaged about forty yards and 
ho played a clean, hard game.
First 'Quarter.
Grover kicked off for Ohio to Lynn 
on the 10-yard line and ho was tackled 
on tlio 35-yard line by Ferguson.

Lynn made eighteen yards from punt 
formation. On the next play his pass 
was Intercepted by Krieger who was 
downed on his own 35-yard lino.
Rlfo went off loft tackle for four 
yards and Watkins made two around 
right end. Krieger was held for no 
gain at the lino. He then punted thir
ty* five yards to Bloom who was down
ed on his thirty-five yard lino.
Alexander mado oightoon around 
loft oiicl and Ginn ploughed through 
loft laeklo for eight more. Buchanon 
broke through and spilled Bloom for 
Q| slight loss on an attempted forward 
pass. Alexander was good for one 
yard at the lino. Bloom added fifteen 
yards on a run around right ond. 
Alexander made three through the 
line and Bloom was held for no gain. 
He then made four around right end 
bringing tlio ball to tlio Ohio 25-yard

DOND TO BE PURCHASED BY SCIENCE SENIORS
At a special meeting of the Senior 
Class of the School of Aplied Science 
it was decided to use the money, left 
undeposited in Mr. I-Ieyls office, to jurcliase a U. S. Government Loan Bond.
This money which amounted to 
over two hundred dollars, resulted 
through an action taken by the class 
in their Plebe year. Tlio class at this 
time voted to contribute tlio remain
der pf their breakage fees each year 
to a fund with which a memorial to 
tlio school would be purchased.
XI tlio splendid opportunity of a 
Bond presented Itself, the class unani
mously decided to purchase one and 
at the time of the expiration of the 
bond, a committee of the class of 191.8 
will present a memorial to the school 
from the proceeds.
This is a very patriotic action on the 
part of the Seniors and it is hoped 
that many other classes will follow 
their splendid example.

OUR LETTER
At last Wednesdays General As
sembly of the Science School the chief 
subject discussed was Liberty Bonds. 
Mr. R. W. Frank, president of the 
United Engineering Foundry Company 
spoke very interestingly concerning 
his personal observations of the pres
ent war, and made a spirited appeal 
for the Second Liberty Loan. A com
mittee of two from the Margaret Mor
rison School also made a silent, but 
none the less effective plea for the 
same cause.
The Senior class held a short meet
ing following the assembly, and voted 
that the two hundred dollars in its 
treasury be. used to purchase Liberty 
Bonds.

INGSOCIETY :
Gentlemen of the Faculty and Student Body:
' The Tartan realizes that the following suggestion is going to be 
unpopular. Lack of popularity is, however, no indication of the basic 
right ir wroilg of any proposition. Peace and brotherly love have 
certainly met with no cordial reception at the hands of the German 
Government during the past few years, yet no one will argue openly 
against those propositions of fundamental right. Similarly we sug
gest that you give the following matter your careful consideration 
before exhibiting any of that aversion which has been only too evi
dent in some quarters in the immediate past.
Gentlemen, do you realize that it is now well into the second 
month of school and that practically nothing has been done in regard 
to the setting-up exercises announced so confidently at the first gen
eral assembly? Design School has made some attempt, but the at
tendance record has been so farcical that drastic rules in that respect 
have become necessary. Industries School has gymnasium periods on 
its schedule, but they aro there for no purpose. Science School does 
not even have those hours scheduled. In limes like these, when the 
only logilinmte reason a man has for being here is the opportunity for 
increased service which comes after increased edncation, in times like 
those, we say, men are not being kept physically fit. In Ihcsc days 
of War, men aro not now getting even the amount of gymnasium 
work which they had in former years, far less any increased amount.
No doubt I he intent ions of the various faculties are perfectly 
good, no doubt the exercises are going to come some of these days, 
but, that is not the point. Whatever may be the obstacle to the speedy 
completion of arrangements, remember that no difficulty is insm 
mountable, and many a perfectly good scheme has been ruined by 
too great delay.
The ofloct of all this dilly-dallying is only too evident among the 
student body. Practically every conversation which we have started 
upon flie subject, has elicited some such comment as this: Aw, let 
if drop, or Oh, koep that qnief. I'm hoping the faculty has for
gotten that, and so on. This comes not only from the rank and file 
of the student hotly, but i'l'onl the leaders of student affairsfrom 
the officers of the school senates, from men connected with athletic 
activities, from men in the Y. M. C. A., from members .of our own 
stafffrom everyone, in fact, is that Carnegie spirit?
We realize that the men are busy, yet lack of time comes far 
from being a valid excuse for the execrable spirit exhibited. Gen
tlemen, the Piches arc not too busy! As you know from the accom
panying columns of The Tartan, if not from personal observation, 
the Seienoc Plebes have instituted a system not only of exercise but 
of regulation drill. We wonder what the alumni will say when they 
find that Carnegie has come to such a pass that her incoming classes 
lead the way for her uncnthusiastic upperclassmenmen who call 
themselves so busy that they are tip-toeing around for fear someone 
will discover that the faculty has forgotten to make them do what is 
only their duty. We wonder.
We sympathize in a way with those men of Design, who have 
objected to the stringent regulations adopted there, but only to this 
extent:it is manifestly unfair to punish their men for non-attend
ance when it is obvious that they lack the spirit just as thoroughly as 
men from other schools, who are not punished. If we are going to 
do the thing, let us all do it right. If the faculty cannot find time or 
accommodations for us, or if the students are going to renounce the 
ideals set up at the first military meeting last year, then it is time to 
say so openly. But if we are going on with the thing, it is more than 
time to begin.
TARTAN BUYS LIBERTY BONDS
The Tartan has decided to buy two fifty dollar Liberty Bonds. 
After a conference at tho Oakland Savings and Trust Company, last 
Saturday, Manager Rice readied the decision that the paper should 
invest, in two of the smallest variety of coupon bonds.
It. is not too late for us to say, How about, you ?" The campaign 
docs not come to a close until Saturday of this week. There is still 
plenty of time to follow the example of the Industries Assembly, the 
Science Senior Class, and now The Tartan. Buy a bond!

DIJQUESNE' THEATER
Elizabeth Marbury and Frederick 
McKay, who have formed a partner
ship In the production of musical 
plays, will present We Should Wor
ry, the first result of their collabor
ation, at the .Duquesne theater, open
ing on Monday, October 29, for an 
engagement of two weeks. "Wo 
Should Worry is by Henry Blossom, 
author of Princess Pat, The Only 
Girl and Eileen, which are cur
rently successful throughout the 
country.
The theme of the piece is based 
upon what is generally referred to 
by old-time theatergoers as the best 
larce ever written by the late Charles 
I-I. Hoyt, A Texas Steer.
Miss Marburry is best known to 
the theatergoers through her identi
fication with the production of No
body Home and Very Good Eddie, 
both of which had very long runs in 
New York and toured since with sev
eral companies; and Mr. McKay is 
known to local theatergoers through 
his presentation here of The Yankee 
Girl, The Wall Street Girl aria 
When Claudie Smiles, with Blanche 
Ring as the star.
We Should Worry concerns the 
putting through the election of a 
wealthy Texan to Congress much 
against his will, and in fact without 
his knowledge, thanks to the efforts 
of his enterprising daughter, Bossie.

the Parry Islands to the Cape Horn, 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific; peo
ples, who, even now, show all stages 
of social and economic developement, 
and the remain^ of a glorious art.
, Let us but lightly touch upon the 
sources of inspiration for costume and 
decoration to be found in historic in
cident.
A splendid civilization was erected 
by the Taltic and Inca peoples, de
graded by the marauding Aztecs, and 
finally overthrown by the bigoted 
Spanish under Cortez and Pizzano, 
following the arrival on this continent 
of Columbus and Vespucci, who were 
preceded by the Norsemen headed by 
one Olaf. The Spanish worked the 
silver and gold mines of Central Amer
ica with Indian slaves, hoarded the 
bullion in two or three fabled treas
ure cities until sent to Spain in the 
Blate Fleets, which were harried 
by pirates and buccaneers, of whom 
Kidd Blacltbeard and Bonnet are not
able.
The picturesque Missions of Califor
nia. and Old Mexico, the colorful cre
ole settlements in Louisiana, the 
camps of Pilgrims and Puritans fol
lowed after the explorers and dis
coverers Hudson and Balboa, and De 
Sota.. Boone and his men in Ken
tucky at the opening of the Revolution 
were rugged masterfpl men. The Hu
guenots and later the emigrants flee
ing the French Revolution, the naval 
expedition against the Barbany States, 
the Louisiana Purchase, the War with 
Mexico, the gold rush of 49, the quiet-, 
ly romantic dute-bellum days, the Civil 
War, the Ku-Klux, the imigrations of 
the Mormons, the White Caps, Coxeys Armyevery one a distinctive 
costume note in the American Page
ant, the melting pot, the grand en
semble leavened by Indian peon, Ne
gro, Esquimaux, Patagonian, and the 
peoples of the east.
The field of decorative schemes is 
no barren one, when spread before 
one's eyes is the mighty panorama of 
the frozen north and Esquiman iglovos 
the medicine lodges of /the Senecas 
and Iiurous, the teepees of the Navajos and cliffs of the Hopi.
Look about youthe chamber is 
large, the mad flickering light from 
two huge firebaskets show the stone 
walls to be richly carved in pictographs, grotesque and complicate 
ornament, all impelling the eye to
ward the great figure seated beyond 
the altar and the calendar. The fea
tures of the image are indistinct but 
as the light steadies, for an instant 
all impression is gained of revolting 
hideousness bestiality, inhuman cruel
ty and implacable hate, yet fortified 
by calm and majesty, patent wrath, 
and awful fury. Upon ones sense 
throbs the pulse of muffled drums, 
cresende on cresende until the mad 
cacophony of crash and peal of drum 
and cymbal is risen by the frenzied 
shriek of pipe and horn. The studied 
clamor dies, a wail of woe incarnate, 
sweeps low over - the heads of the 
kneeling thronga choir of priestly 
voices chants the Hymn of Awful 
Nightmad figures dancethe lights 
die outthe throng is gone.
Such was a night ip the Temple of 
I-Iintzilopochtlithe implacable one.

cinity, of the Central Building. Here
after at most hours, one or more sec
tions of Plebes will be found drilling; 
about the campus. The admirable fea
ture is that no one is obligated to put. 
in extra time. Each section drills at 
its own convenience, at times when, 
the extra hour would no doubt be 
wasted. Such instances are, when the=. 
first hour of the day is vacant, when 
there are two hojirs for lunch, and', 
when the day is short. Each section 
is expected to drill three, four or fivetimes a week, and later on frequent, 
reviews and company drills will take 
place.
In again starting this drill, it islioped that the seriousness of the par
ticipants will influence the remainder 
of the students to fall in line and do 
their bit. Most of them are ready 
and willing to get down to business.

FORMER TECH STUDENT ENGAGED BY GOVERNMENT
The manner in which the Govern
ment is being served by trained men 
in other capacities than that of a 
private soldier is again shown in 
the calling of one cr the most suc
cessful of Techs graduates.
Because of his expert mechanical 
engineering skill, Raymond F. Crom 
of 545 Hawkins avenue, North Braddock, has been given an office in the 
War Department in the bureau of en
gineering and designing, and left 
yesterday for Washington. He will 
take up his duties tomorrow. He will 
be a designer of heavy artillery in 
the gun division.
Mr. Crom was graduated from the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology in 
1913, and as a designer of coke en
gines for the H. Koppers Company 
of Pittsburgh, made a reputation. 
The War Department, it is said, 
made two requests for his services.

ILAWTOCHFRARIE HELD | j BANQUET LAST THURSDAY
Last Thursday evening the annual 
Lawtochfrarie banquet was held. 
At that time the* following men were 
taken into the society: Foxon, Wen
ning, Giflen, Emerich, Schmucker, 
Herrmann, Benson, Swift, Gare and 
Fleming.. These men now take up the 
active work of the sophomore hon
orary society.
(Continued From Page One.) 
Conelley, brought this point home in 
a short address to the students in 
which he commended the assembly 
very highly on its prompt action. In 
a visit to Harvard University during 
the past summer, the speaker was 
greatly impressed by the memorials 
of that university, the stress that was 
laid on them, and the pride the fac
ulty, alumni and the student' body 
took in them. There was a monu
ment erected to the memory of Har
vard men who fought with the boys 
of '76. There was another to those 
in the war of 1812, the war with Mex
ico had its ,memorial and other tab
lets listed the names of those who 
left their alma mater to help keep the 
Union intact in 61.
Compared in years to the above in
stitution the School of Applied Indus
tries is but an infant. We have but 
little to do with the past. The ques
tion is What will the traditions of 
Industries be when it has withstood 
the ravages of time as Harvard has 
and what tribute can she pay to the 
heroes who left school tjti offer their 
lives for the cause of humanity.
A committee of seven has been ap
pointed to collect the money from the 
students, the results to be posted each 
day until the specified amount has 
been reached.

INDUSTRIES GRADUATE GOES TO CAMP MEADE
The following letter, which ex
presses In plain terms one old Tech 
man's attitude toward the war, and' 
also his feeling for his school, was 
recovied by the Tartan 'a. few days 
;igo. The whole school joins in wish
ing Levin "happy chance:"
"Dear Friends at Tech:
"1 have received The Tartan and it 
seems lo me that it is better than 
ever. It brings back to me all the 
happiest days of my three years at 
Dear Old Tech. I have been employed 
in the Navy Yard from the day I 
left. Tech until today, five months. I 
have been drafted and been accepted. 
After a consultation, the doctors said 
that a new ruling was that if a mans 
eyes, regardless now poor, are cor
rected with glasses he is acceptable. 
Believe me, I was happy to hear that 
because while in Pittsburgh I tried to 
get in the engineering corps but my 
eyes were not good enough. So at 
last I am going to get into the great
est show on earth. That is "where 
I feel I belong. Today I am going 
to pack up my belongings and wait 
for that green card whichwill notify 
me that in three days I am to report 
to Camp Meade, Md. But until fur
ther notice, send The Tartain to my 
home address, 54 Wintlirop street, 
Hartford, Conn. With best regards 
to all the boys back at Tech, I am,

BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 
CLUB HOLD BANQUET
At eight oclock Monday night the' 
Building Construction Club held a 
banquet and regular meeting, at the 
Laurel. About thirty men were pres
ent including Faculty members and 
Plebes.
One object of the banquet was to 
acquaint the Plebes with the ideals 
and purposes of the club and to ac
tually show them the club's workings.
Great regret was expressed over 
the leave of absence of Mr. Wagoner, 
instructor in the brick shop, which 
shop is an important factor in the 
Building Construction course.
This was the first meeting of the 
year, but all indications point toward 
a very successful year for this pro
gressive organization.

ficer on the Board of Control. He is 
remembered as having served in the 
same capacity for the day students 
for several years, and thereby needs 
no further introduction.
And for the rest of the officers 
elected for the forth coming year, the 
night students of the Applied Design 
School should feel highly compliment
ed in having made such a judicious 
selection, for each man seems to be 
amply qualified to fill their respective 
positions.

DESIGN SCHOOL NIGHT CLASSES lELECT OFFICERS
The night students of the School of 
'Applied Design met".on Friday even
ing, October lOtli, to elect officers, but 
since the president and secretarytreasurer of last years officers were 
called to defend the nations colors 
and honor, (lie duty devolved upon the 
vice president, Mr. lv. B. Weber, who 
called tho meeting to order.
After the rending of the minutes of 
the last, meeting and the report of the 
treasurer the meeting proceeded to 
the election of officers for the ensuing 
year.
Mr. Tv. B. Weber of the Architec
tural was elected president, with A. 
IT. Fitz of the Painting and Decorating 
seqtion as vice president.
Mr. George N. Pauly of the Archi
tectural was elected as secretary 
treasurer.
For Student Senate the following 
men were elected: B. C(. B^er and S. 
Jvitay of Painting and Decorating, 
Edgar Hazel, J. C. More and Richard 
Halle of the. Architectural.
Messrs. K. B. Weber and Richard 
Halle were elected to the Thistle 
Board.
Fred C. Williams of Painting and 
Decoarting was elected representative 
to the Student Activities Board.
Mr. J. M. Adams of the Architectur
al was elected as representative to 
the Board of Control.
Much is expected from this selec
tion of officers and what the night 
students expect, they can confidently 
rest assured to realize. The newly ap
pointed president, Mr. Weber, is well 
known as one who does things, for, 
last year he had charge of the dance 
held by the night schools which was 
credited as being a success in every 
way. Then matters pertaining to the 
Thistle benefited by his expert lead
ership.
For Student Activities, F. C. Wil
liams ought to take care of the night 
students. Mr. Williams is well known 
as tho president of the Nite Tech 
Design which has continued its meet
ings as well as conducted sketching 
tours during the summer vacation. Its 
meetings and success was at once 
enjoyable, Instructive and profitable 
to all its members and the night stu
dents of the School of Applied Design 
may well rest assured that Mr. Wil
liams will do all in liis power to work 
for their interest.
Mr. Pauly as secretary-treasurer 
will be a capable man to augment the 
treasury of this organization by the 
proper collection of the members 
dues.
Mr. Adams proved to be a loyal ofTliis week brings the return of Don
ald Robertson to the dramatic depart
ment of\ Design School to produce sev
eral plays.
This is the second visit of Mr. Rob
ertson to the school; the first was dur 
ing the firs^ year of the existance of 
this' department. During this visit 
Mr. Robertson produced the first big 
production of the department, "Two 
Gentlemen of Verona. T-Ie also pro
duced TVIoliedes "Tartuffe. Mr. Rob 
ertson is a producer of note in addi
tion to being a playwright, actor and 
poet. He has collaborated at different 
times with Mr. Stevens, head of the 
dramatic department in the produc
tion of pageants, one of their most 
recent productions being "The Page
ant of tho Dunes, produced in Chi
cago last spring. The students of the 
department realize the advantage of 
working under such a man as Mr, 
Robertson, and are making the best 
of his visit here.'
EXHIBITION OF DESIGN STUDENTS SUMMER WORK
A collection of summer work done 
by some of the students of the Paint
ing and Decoration department of the 
School of Applied Design is now on 
exhibition in the Junior and Senior 
Illustration Room. This exhibit, al
though small, is well worth seeing, as 
it represents work done on the stu
dents own initiative, without super
vision or instruction of any kind. Per
haps the best thing in the collection is 
a small decorative drawing by Helen 
Freeman, although the sketches by 
Jeannette Shirk are extremely well 
done.
Some outdoor studies in oil by 
Readio show wonderful feeling and 
composition, and a set of book-ends 
by Florence Schell attract immediate 
attention, as does also a unique pho: 
tograph album decoration by A. J. 
Knorr.
The most striking exhibit is no 
doubt the "Batik work. This is done 
by an ancient Japanese process which 
is achieved by the use of beeswax 
and dyes in a very intricate and deli
cate manner. The chief work of this 
nature is a nude by Stiffler. He also 
exhibits a bag in Batik which is an 
artistic gem.
GIRLS HAVE BUREAU OF RECOMMENDATION
This year the Bureau of Recom
mendations has decided to include the 
girls in its scope. Miss Zeta Senn 
from Central building, has been in
terviewing girls in M. M. C. S. and 
Design School as to the kind of work 
they would be willing to do provided 
the bureau could procure Saturday or 
after school jobs for them.
Several very attractive offers for 
girls wishing to earn board and room 
have been received, and calls for girls 
to stay with children come in fre
quently. However, this phase of the 
work is new and another year will 
find it giving better service.

P. P. CLAXTCN S MESSAGE TO COLLEGE STUDENTS
(From the Patriotic News Service of 
the National Committee of Patrio
tic Societies.)
The defeat of the German auto
cracy is not only the task of armies 
and navies, but of every one who be
lieves in the principles of democ
racy. It is not alone our soldiers 
and sailors who are fighting Ger
many but every true American should 
also be doing what lie can to bring 
about a speedy victory.
Young men and women in our 
American universities and colleges 
will soon be playing a very real 
part in our national life. You are 
preparing yourselfi now for future 
usefulness. You should remember 
always that your first duty is to the 
nation and that you will find your 
highest personal success in public 
service.
The fact that your country is at 
war imposes on you a double ,duty 
to study as hard as possible and to 
make yourself as valuable economic
ally as you can. Live up to your 
duty as well as the men in the 
trenches are living up to theirs.
There is however, one way you 
can be of immediate assistance to 
your country. You can purchase and 
help sell Liberty bonds. Put what 
money you can spare now into the 
safest investment in the world. The 
cash, into which you can at any time 
convert these interest-bearing bonds, 
may prove useful when you are 
starting to earn your own living. 
Buy  Liberty bonds and urge others 
to buy them.
Yours sincerely,
P. P. CLAXTON, 
Head of the U. S. Dept. of Educa
tion.
The above articlewas contributed 
by the National Committee of Pa
triotic Societies with the following 
explanation: *
October 20, 1917. 
Dear Sir:You will readily make
this out J# be a form letter. It is 
however of the vitalest importance 
and deservesyour most careful at
tention. The reason we will seldom 
he able to write you a special person
al letter is that we will always wish 
to send the same message to the ed
itors of papers in about three hun
dred colleges and universities 
throughout the United States.
Realizing how much the nation 
will depend in the future on the 
young men and women who are nowstudying in our colleges and universi
ties throughout America, the Nation
al Committee on Patriotic Societies 
is going to attempt to co-operate with' 
each higher institution of learning

J. WOODMAN THOMPSON 
DOING NOTABLE WORK
The work of Mr. J. Woodman 
1 hompson, whose scene designs for 
plays produced in the Little Theater 
of the School of Applied Design have 
drawn expression of apreciation from 
every one who saw them, is becom
ing known outside the circle of the 
school and its immediate vicinity. 
T he work which he does here, no mat
ter how beautiful, necessarily reaches 
only a limited number of people, but 
even this small number have succeed
ed in malting him well known.
Mr. Thompson recently costumed, 
directed, and designed and executed 
settings for a Pageant of Columbus, 
which was-produced for a week in 
Cathedral Hall, and was pronounced 
an artistic triumph by all who wit
nessed it.
This was not the flrst work of this 
nature done by Mr. Thompson, but is 
perhaps the flrst time due credit has 
been given him. He also designed and 
executed several tapestries for the 
settings of Baa, Baa, Black Sheep 
at the Duquesne Theater this week.
