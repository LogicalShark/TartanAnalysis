WRCT provides Senate forum
By SHARMILA 
VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Whats wrong with Student 
Senate? Ever wanted to answer 
that question, but were too busy 
or intimidated to go to a Senate 
meeting? In order to encourage 
interaction between student 
senators and the student body, 
Student Senate has reinstated 
Student Senate Hour, a weekly 
radio show aired on WRCT. The 
station broadcasted Senates 
third show of the semester last 
Tuesday. The show ran once be
fore in 1993.
Executive committee members 
mediated the talk show, which 
has initiated conversations about  
campus related issues such as 
the cancellation of classes in re
membrance of Martin Luther 
King, Jr. and parking problems.
It was kind of like [a student 
senate meeting], except on air 
and less formal, said executive 
committee member Mike 
Szudarek, a senior social and 
decision sciences major. We 
tried get people to call in, to stir 
up debate.
The resurrection of GSAs pro
posal to separate from Student 
Senate, which will be proposed for 
a third time at Thursdays Senate 
meeting, is this weeks topic for 
the show. Senate members hope 
to provide ample venues for dis
cussion of the proposal before the 
vote; the resolution was rejected 
last semester by one vote mainly 
because senators did not fully un
derstand what GSAs separation 
from Student Senate entailed, said 
Student Body President Bryon 
Krug, a senior electrical and com
puter engineering major.
[Krug] has done a good job of 
gettinghis name out and Senate is 
often overshadowed by him, said 
Szudarek. ...I want Student Sen
ate to shine on its own. Its not a 
slam against Bryon, but its time 
to push Senate into the spotlight.
Szudarek said he made a recom
mendation to Senate that Krug 
not be invited to participate in the 
show. Although Krug along with 
other officers will sit in on 
Tuesdays broadcast, Student Gov
ernment executive officers were 
not invited to sit in on the show in 
an attempt to separate Student 
Senate from Student Government.
I like to think that most 
people on Student Government 
care more about results than 
who gets credit, said Krug. I 
think we get more done by work
ing together... than by creating 
imaginary boundaries.... 
If the proposal to split GSA 
from Student Senate passes, 
then there will be a stronger 
need to distinguish Senate 
as its own identity, accord
ing to Student Senate Chair 
Will Toransson, a junior 
physics major. Then Stu
dent Senate will really be 
independent of Student Gov
ernment, he said.
The radio show also opens 
Senate issues up to a different 
audience, said Szudarek. I 
dont know how many people 
are actually listening [to the 
show], and WRCTs news re
lated shows dont generally 
have a large following, but if it 
helps at least one person get 
involved, then its worth it, 
he said.
Future topics planned for 
the show include online reg
istration and the upcoming 
Senate elections.

Tartan Managing Editor
For the third time in the last two 
semesters, Student Senate will vote on a 
plan to redefine the role of graduate 
students in Senate. The plan, similar to 
the one proposed last semester, will make 
the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) a 
separate governing body with 
its own financial resources and 
bylaws. Last semester, the 
proposal was only one vote shy 
of being passed. If passed at 
this Thursdays Senate meet
ing, GSA will become the offi
cial representative of gradu
ate students, and Senate will 
represent only undergradu
ates. Activities Fee allocation 
will become the joint responsibility of 
GSA and Senate. Both branches will op
erate under one constitution.
Graduate student representation is 
the issue that just wont die. Since last 
summer (1996), GSA and Student Gov
ernment have been discussing ways to 
improve this representation.... I think 
the proposal will be a very effective
change, said Bryon Krug, student body 
president and senior ECE major.
A proposal was created by a commit
tee of graduates and undergraduates 
last semester after a problem was recog
nized with inadequate graduate student 
representation. The proposal was not 
voted in by Senate primarily because 
Senators were given insufficient infor
mation about the proposal. This semes
ter, John Muir (a senior SDS major), 
Will Torraason (a junior physics major), 
and Krug explained the proposal to sena
tors at individual committee meetings. 
According to Krug, the small group dis
cussions allowed individual senators to 
raise objections and ask questions that

dollar, both of which go to the United

Time and attention are some of the 
scarcest resources on campus, so re
minding people in a simple and effective 
way once a year is a convenience, said 
Mark Kamlet, dean of the Heinz School 
and the Universitys campaign coordi
nator.
Last year, [CMU] had been identified 
by the United Way as one of the organi
zations that they wanted to make a 
special effort to increase giving. And we 
rose to the challenge, said Kamlet.
Part of the reason for United Ways 
recent push for an increase in Univer
sity fundraising has been the downsizing 
of Pittsburgh big businesses like 
Westinghouse. In years past, United Way 
has relied on such businesses for sizable 
contributions. In the crunch, they have 
had to rely more on help from other

WorldCom makes hostile 
bid for MCI Corporation
NEW YORK ( AP)  WorldCom Inc. 
made a hostile $29.4 billion offer to 
buy MCI Communications Corp. 
Wednesday morning, a bold attempt 
to become a giant in long-distance tele
phone and Internet service and break 
up British Telecoms deal to buy MCI.
The WorldCom bid, if successful, 
would be the largest merger in corpo
rate history.
WorldComs offer takes advantage 
of recent troubles between British 
Telecom and MCI over projected losses 
in MCIs local phone business. BT in 
August said it would pay significantly 
less for MCI.
WorldCom, the nations fourth-largestlong-distance company, has already 
been on a buying binge to increase its 
business of providing Internet service. 
In the last month, it struck a deal to 
acquire CompuServe Corp. and divide 
it with America Online.
The combination of WorldCom and 
MCI, already the nations second larg
est phone company, would not eclipse 
No. 1 AT&T.
WorldCom is a distant fourth in the 
long-distance market. The company pre
dominantly serves corporate customers.
WorldCom said its offer would be 
better for MCI than British Tel ecoms
because it already has built an ex
tensive local phone network in the 
United States.
BT and MCI are both great compa
nies in their own rights, but the fit just 
isnt right, WorldCom president and 
chief executive Bernard J. Ebbers said.
Asked about the chances of complet
ing the acquisition despite the exist
ing BT deal, Ebbers said, Were going 
to see this thing through.
BT in late August cut its purchase 
price for MCI by 20 percent after MCI 
projected its local phone business would 
lose $800 million this year trying to 
grab market share from the Baby Bells.
WorldCom is offering $41.50 worth 
of its stock for each MCI share. British 
Telecoms revised deal is for a combi
nation of BT stock and cash currently 
worth about $34.15 a share, valuing 
MCI at $24 billion.
British Telecom and MCI had al
ready cleared all regulatory hurdles 
for their merger, which was first an
nounced in November. However, 
shareholders of both companies have 
yet to approve the revised terms.
MCI declined to comment on 
WorldCom-s bid, but said it wouldhave 
a statement later in the day. British 
Telecom also declined to comment.

Bernard Ebbers, CEO of WorldCom Inc., announced that WorldCom has made a bid 
for MCI Communications during a news conference in New York on October 1.
Fraternity pledge 
dies from alcohol
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)  A fresh
man found unconscious amid vomit and 
empty liquor bottles at a Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology fraternity has 
died of alcohol poisoning. Scott Krueger, 
18, of Orchard Park, N.Y., died late 
Monday, three days after the fraternity 
pledge was discovered in his basement 
room at the Phi Gamma Delta house.
His parents said his blood-alcohol level 
had reached .410 percent  five times 
the legal limit for drivers in Massachu
setts. Authorities say that means he 
consumed about 16 drinks. The medical 
examiner said Tuesday that Krueger 
died of an alcohol overdose.
It was at least the second such death 
at an American university this semes
ter. In August, a Louisiana State Uni
versity fraternity pledge died at a hospi
tal after a night of drinking.
A clean-cut three-letter athlete who 
graduated in the top 10 of the 325 stu
dents in his high school class, Krueger 
had attended a party at the fraternity 
earlier that night where he was paired 
off with a big brother, and where alco
hol was served, school officials said.
Police have begun a criminal investi
gation, and licensing authorities in Bos
ton, where the fraternity is located, have 
charged it with serving alcohol to mi
nors, allowing an overdose of alcohol, 
and other violations. The drinking age 
in all states is 21. MIT has also sus
pended Phi Gamma Delta from partici
pating in campus social activities.
Students said Phi Gamma Delta pro
moted an image of itself as MITs Ani
mal House fraternity. Several said they 
had been offered beer there during the 
freshman summer rush week, despite 
university regulations banning alcohol 
at the event. Officers of the MIT chapter 
and the fraternitys national headquar
ters declined to comment.
MITs other fraternities and its dormitory 
council have agreed to ban alcohol indefi
nitely, and the school is sending letters to 
students, holding seminars and asking resi
dent advisors to counsel freshmen.
Jon Tong, 21, an MIT senior, said 
the heightened awareness wont last 
long. Two years down the road, I 
question whether people will remem
ber this incident, he said. My per
sonal opinion is that things will just 
continue as they were.

Researchers find 
new cold remedy
TORONTO (AP)The next best thing 
to a cure for the common cold is on the 
way: a medicine that helps you feel only 
half as rotten as you ordinarily would 
when the sniffles do strike. Researchers 
on Tuesday described the successful 
human testing of the first medicine that 
eases cold symptoms by attacking the 
cold virus itself.
Its still several years away from the 
drugstore, cautioned Dr. Ronald B. 
Turner, who said he could not be more 
specific. A genetically engineered medi
cine called ICAM-1 clearly seems to make 
colds less severe if sprayed into the nose 
around the time of infection.
Standard cold remedies try to tone 
down the bodys reaction to the cold 
virus rather than thwart the germ itself. 
Antiviral approaches have been tried 
before, but they did not work.
One obstacle to finding an effective 
medicine is that so many different bugs 
cause colds. The most common by far is 
the rhinovirus, which accounts for about 
40 percent of them. But there are more 
than 100 different strains of rhinovirus.
A few years ago, scientists learned 
how almost all the rhinoviruses get
into the body. They attach themselves 
to a particular protein on the cells of 
the nasal lining. Scientists call this 
protein intracellular adhesion mol
ecule-1, or ICAM-1.
Train sets speed 
record in Japan
TOKYO (AP)An experimental Japa
nese train set a world speed record Fri
day, reaching 279.6 mph on a test track 
in central Japan, railroad officials said.
The three-car MLX01 beat the record 
for a manned, magnetically levitated 
train set June 1993 by Transrapid, a 
similar manned train in Germany, by .6 
mph, said Nami Kobayashi, a spokes
woman for railway company JR Tokai.
The train, which doesnt touch the 
track when powerful magnetic fields al
low it to levitate, carried 16 researchers 
on the test track in Yamanashi prefec
ture (state) southwest of Tokyo. The 
train was developed by JR Tokai and the 
Railway Technical Research Institute.
Researchers hope the train will reach a 
velocity of 341 mph by next spring, which 
would surpass the 1979 world record of 
320.5 mph reached by an unmanned ve
hicle at a test facility in Miyazaki prefec
ture, southwestern Japan.
Museum buys complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton at New York auction
NEW YORK (AP)A Chicago 
museum paid nearly $8.4 mil
lion Friday for a 65-million-year 
old dinosaur skeleton  the most 
complete Tyrannosaurus rex 
ever recovered.
The virtually complete 50-footlong skeleton  named Sue  
was sold to the Field Museum of 
Natural History in Chicago, 
where it will go on exhibit in the 
year 2000.
Bidding at Sothebys auction 
house started at $500,000 before 
reaching the selling price of 
$8,362,500, minutes after the 
morning sale began. Sothebys
officials expected the fossil to sell 
for more than $1 million, though 
no pre-sale estimate was set.
Among the donors who helped 
buy Sue are McDonalds and Walt 
Disney World Resorts. Both com
panies will get replicas of the 
original for display in Florida and 
for a tour of the country.
This dinosaur is a world trea
sure, something so irreplaceable, 
David Redden, executive vice 
president of Sothebys, said be
fore the sale.
We have never sold anything 
of this importance, and nobody 
else has either.
The skeleton includes a tooth 
fragment from a rival T-rex em
bedded in a rib, and a gouge on 
the side of her skull, a wound 
that may have caused her death. 
Her lower left jaw is crushed, and 
she suffered a broken leg. One toe 
claw weighs two pounds.
Most T-rexes are only 40 to 50 
percent complete. Sues remains 
approach 100 percent.
The middle-aged female T-rex 
was discovered in 1990 by Sue 
Hendrickson, who was walking 
on a Cheyenne River reservation 
ranch in South Dakota, owned by 
Maurice Williams. It arrived in
New York last October, packed in 
130 crates and boxes.
Although not the biggest dino
saur ever discovered, the Tyranno
saurus rex, which lived during the 
late-Cretaceous period, 65 to 85 
million years ago, is certainly one 
of the largest terrestrial carnivores 
of all time. The biped was known 
for its speed and agility despite its 
underdeveloped forelimbs. It had 
4-foot long jaws with 6-inch ser
rated teeth. Its long, thick tail pro
vided balance and quick turning. 
Tyrannosaurus rex was about 40- 
50 feet long, about 15-20 feet tall, 
and about 5-6 tons in weight.

50 YEARS AGO, November 
11, 1947  Food prices at Skibo 
went up the week before due to 
rising wholesale food costs. Prices 
at the restaurant had remained 
the same for over four years until 
the increase occurred. When the 
increased wholesale prices meant 
Skibo would have to take a loss, 
Skibo was forced to pass on the 
costs to its consumers. It was 
emphasized that Skibo was a non
profit organization, but it had to 
cover its own bills.
25 YEARS AGO, October 17, 
1972After heated debate, Stu
dent Senate tabled a motion to 
increase the Activities Fee from 
$10 to $15 per semester. Until 
the time of the debate, Student 
Government had received $10 
from the administration for each 
full-time day student. This made 
the effective tuition $1240. The
money was used to fund the Ac
tivities Board, The Tartan, 
WRCT, and other campus orga
nizations. Today, Student Sen
ate is having a similar debate on 
the same issue.
10 YEARS AGO, October 6, 
1987  Two Delta Upsilon (DU) 
brothers were injured in an as
sault by unidentified Alpha Tau 
Omega (ATO) brothers while try
ing to enter ATOs porch on pledge 
night. Bill Richardson, a senior, 
received lacerations to his right 
eye and right side of his face. 
Evan Klein, a junior, was hit twice 
in the nose. Kleins broken nose 
eventually required surgery. The 
two were members of a group of 
30 to 40 DU brothers and pledges 
going to other houses in a pledge 
night tradition. On pledge night, 
about half the houses get all the 
brothers and pledges together and
go to the other fraternities and 
sororities. When they get to an
other house, they make a lot of 
noise and charge the porch. After 
attaining the porch, they usually 
get a beer and leave. When some 
of the DU brothers got to the ATO 
porch, they were told to stay off 
the porch. Ignoring the warning, 
DU charged the porch. They were 
stopped but DU charged again, 
after which punches began to be 
thrown by the ATO brothers. DU 
retreated and skirmishes broke 
out on the lawn.
FIVE YEARS AGO, October 
5, 1992  Student Senate 
passed a resolution condemn
ing the actions of the Office of 
the President for failing to con
sult with or notify them regard
ing the rephrasing of the State
ment of Assurance that is placed 
on University documents that
leave the school. According to 
the Student Handbook, any rec
ommended change in the State
ment of Assurance should be 
discussed with Faculty Senate 
and Student Senate before sub
mission to the President.
ONE YEAR AGO, October 7, 
1996The Faculty Search Coin* 
mittee continued its search for a 
replacement of then-president 
Mehrabian. At the time, they were 
busily in the process of searching 
their list of approximately 530 
people to find suitable candidates 
for the presidency. Prospects were 
considered not only from aca
demic areas, but also industry, 
government, and foundationsThe committee eventually settled 
on Dr. Jared Cohon.

Unlike some of the amenities in CFA, 
the 24-hour multimedia cluster is open 
to all students, regardless of their home

requiring that students wishing to use
the specialized hardware in the cluster 
take a training course.
The purpose of this course, said Tracey 
Futhey, Director of User Services (a di

only to instruct the students how to use 
the machines responsibly, but also to 
inform students of all 
the different applica

sectors, such as the education sector.
Pittsburgh is going through a transi
tion period with bigbusiness, and United 
Way has had to look to other markets to 
make up that loss, said Deborah Smith, 
the United Way campaign associate as
signed to CMU.
It might be unrealistic to expect, how. ever, that educational institutions like 
CMU can make up the difference.
I dont think youre going to replace 
the giving from corporate Pittsburgh
with the giving from non-profit Pitts
burgh, said Don Hale, vice president of 
University Relations. Were prepared 
to step up and do our part, but I dont 
know if its going to replace a need like 
that.
United Way has also faced difficul
ties in recent years on the national 
level. In 1992, the president of United 
Way was accused and later convicted of 
swindling the organization out of more 
than $1 million. It took a few years for 
the organization to recover from the
scandal, and only in the last couple of 
years have contributions returned to 
pre-1992 levels.
As for the University campaign, con
tribution numbers have not been as 
greatly affected as they have nationally.
I dont know that it had that great an 
impact, said Hale, who coordinated the 
CMU campaign at the time of the scan
dal. I think we all recognize there are 
needs to be met in the local community, 
and United Way is an organization that 
addresses those needs.

they would feel uncomfortable asking 
in a large group. Hopefully they will 
understand it better now, said Mike 
Szudarek, chair of the campus affairs 
committee and a junior IDS major.
We have tried our best to communi
cate to the senators, the merits of the 
proposal, said Jay Shankavaram,
president of GSA and a graduate ___
student in architecture.
Currently, there are no gradu
ate students in Senate, but there 
are approximately 36 active mem
bers of GSA. According to Krug, 
undergraduates and graduates 
are not interested in discussing 
the same issues. By creating separate governing bodies, represen
tatives will be able to better serve the 
student body.
Under the current plan, 40 percent of 
the Activities Fee paid by graduate 
students is given directly to GSA. The 
other 60 percent is given to Student 
Senate. The new plan will give 100 
percent , of th.e funds from graduate 
students to GSA, although 90 percent 
of the money will be channeled into the 
Joint Funding Committee (JFC).
This new committee formed by the 
Senate proposal will pool money from 
Senate and GSA Activities Fees. The 
committee will be composed of six un
dergraduate and three graduate stu-^'i 
dents. A majority will have to approve 
any decisions made by the committee,- 
including at least one graduate and one  
undergraduate student. The commit-'

responded that he had none. The 
officer then put his hand on the 
actors right shoulder and said 
that he would have to come down 
to the police station. The actor 
said Okay, but then pushed 
the officer with both hands in 
the chest.
At this point, the other officer 
began to assist the first officer in 
handcuffing the actor. However, 
before the handcuffs were ap
plied, the actor broke free of their 
grasp and started to swing his 
clenched fists. He struck the first 
officer in the lower jaw. After the 
two officers wrestled him to the 
ground, they finally got hand
cuffs on him. The actor contin

causing a crowd to form. The 
actor was examined as best as 
was possible by CMU EMS. The 
actor persisted in his combative

be carried to the police van, dur

officers. One officer was lacked

COMMUNICATION, 1:15 am 
The officer on duty took a harass
ment report over the telephone 
from an Austin, Texas resident. 
He said that he had had a dis
agreement with a CMU student
on a newsgroup. The student 
emailed the victim saying that 
CMU students are hackers and 
that he would not be able to stop 
the deluge of emails he was to 
receive. The victim took this as a 
threat and emailed 
Abuse@andrew.cmu.edu about 
the situation. The next day, he 
received a phone call from a 
DataCom employee concerned 
about the situation. The employee 
said he would look into the mat

officer that he had received over 
700 messages, each three pages 
in length, consisting of random 
text. The mail came from a CMU 
address. The victim believes that 
the student with whom he had 
earlier troubles is responsible and 
also said that email of this vol

his Internet service provider.

| To tackle the age-old problem 
; of lack of event publicity on camigus, Student Activities is once 
 again looking for ways to create 
!new venues for student groups 
| to advertise their programs. But 
! the solution to the problem is not 
; necessarily more advertising out; lets, but a revamping of the ones 
that are already in place.
; The Event Publicity (EventPub) 
! calendar, which was implemented 
jlast fall by Student Activities 
comes out three times a week to 
inform the campus of upcoming 
events. It has proved to be an 
| ineffective resource due mainly to 
poor location and distribution. 
Most students do not know where 
to find the EventPub because it 
;has been placed in obscure spots 
such as on the backs of doors and 
an low traffic areas on campus. 
The calendar is printed on an 8- 
1/2 x 11 inch sheet of paper  
:barely large enough for passersby to notice, let alone read.
EventPub also fails to provide 
a complete listing of events, 
mainly because of poor coordi
nation with organizations.
For the past several years there 
have been plans to create a Mas
ter Calendar, a web-based cen
tral database of event listings, 
but Student Activities has 
dragged their feet on this proj ect. 
The Website, which is due out in 
December, would link together 
calendars from different depart
ments and organizations. This
site will supposedly act as a cen
tralized source of information on 
campus events, eliminating some 
of the problems of the EventPub 
calendar.
One of the biggest resources at 
CMU is students  Student Ac
tivities should make use of them. 
Pooling the talents of design and 
business students to act as adver
tising consultants for event plan
ners would help improve the qual
ity and effectiveness of current 
advertising techniques. Student 
Activities should consider creat
ing a reserve of funding desig
nated to help support such a group 
and also help student organzations 
cover publicity costs.
When the University Housing 
Office added cable television ac
cess to campus dormitories and 
apartments, certain channels 
were reserved for CMU to broad
cast over the air. Televised ad
vertising of event listings would 
improve publicity for activities 
ten-fold.
While such ideas have the 
potential to be successful strat
egies in drawing larger audi
ences to campus events, the 
main factor which generally 
prevents them from living up 
to expectations is that no one 
takes ownership of these plans. 
It is up to those initiating the 
project to makes these re
sources easily accessible for stu
dents to use as a marketing aid 
and as a source of information.

Last week, the English 
departments Student Advisory 
Council once again brought to 
the table plans for a Humanities 
Opportunties Conference (HOC).
While last years H&SS/MCS job 
fair provided technically-oriented humanities majors ample 
opportunity to make connections 
with potential employers, few of 
the companies that were invited 
offered jobs to liberal arts stu
dents. Organizers should make 
sure that the conference does 
not turn in to another measure 
for companies to recruit pro
grammers  the focus of the job 
fair needs to rest on the needs of 
english, philosophy, modern lan
guage, and economics majors as 
well as a variety of other fields in 
which students tend to have dif
ficulty finding jobs.
To begin with, organizers must 
solicit the proper companies  
those that recognize and desire 
the skills that liberal arts ma
jors possess. Some organizations 
that come to mind are govern
ment and non-profit organiza
tions, start-up companies, other 
colleges that offer graduate projgrams, as well as publications,
social research institutions, and 
ipublishing firms.
Some of these companies, such 
as non-profit organizations, 
might have limited financial re
sources; they might not be able 
;to pay the fee of up to $450 that 
the BOC and TOC typically 
charges per booth. In these

Letters to the Editor
Senior responds to Ethnic debate
Editor:
After reading Dave 
Libers article on Eth
nic Clubs last week, I 
wondered why Mr. 
Liber felt he was in
Wihfenty Centn Bra. jn
cases perhaps organizers of the 
HOC should look regionally for 
such companies so that they 
can afford to attend by cutting 
travel costs.
The organization of a job fair 
requires the strong leadership 
of students willing to put in the 
time and dedication. Coordina
tion, ample planning, communi
cation, and a pooling of skills 
and talents are needed to it pull 
off successfully. Most of these 
companies will judge the quality 
and caliber of CMU students 
based on their interactions with 
HOC committee members; 
these students should create a 
professional impression for po
tential employers. Events do not 
run themselves and more often 
than not, the best results hap
pen when students are involved 
because their own interests are 
at stake.
A Humanities Opportunties 
Conference has the potential to 
provide liberal arts students with 
the jump starts they need in 
launching their careers. Students 
should take ownership of the 
project and starting planning now 
 with sohd leadership and focus, 
the fair can give humanities stu
dents the proper direction in their 
job search that they need. Stu
dents in these majors are typi
cally the ones that have the most 
difficulty searching through the 
j ob market. Lasting venues to help 
them through the process need to 
be implemented.
Letter to the Editor
the position to make such amazingly 
broad statements. Just for the record, I 
too am a white male, and my experi
ences at CMU seem to stand in direct 
contradiction to Mr. Libers statements.
Mr. Liber is a freshman. How does he 
expect to know about the Lunar Gala 
Fashion Show, Midnight Bowling, 
Paintball, river-rafting, Valentines Day 
Candygrams, Booth at Carnival, and 
everything else student groups such as 
ASA do for the campus community as a 
whole, regardless of ethnicity, gender, 
or anything else?
I wonder if Mr. Liber has been to any 
of the parties at the ASA House. If he 
has, then he would know that these 
parties are packed with representatives 
from every ethnic group on campus  
even white males  all getting down 
and having a good time together. Divi
sion and segregation arent exactly 
the words I would use to describe this 
sort of thing.
The second problem I had with Mr. 
Libers article was his lack of effort in 
finding out about the organizations that 
he sees fit to attack.
When I came to CMU, I had no desire 
to join any sort of student organization 
whatsoever. But since then, Ive not only 
been an active member of ASA, but House 
Manager for the ASA Special Interest 
House, and ASA Booth Chair for last 
years Carnival (assisted greatly by my 
good friend Steven Yu).
If these organizations promote segre
gation and division among the campus 
community, then how, as a white male, 
did I end up with good friends in just 
about all of them, whether based on 
ethnic, philosophical, or Greek princi
ples? I wonder if Mr. Liber has even had 
time to see the whole campus yet.
I wonder if he feels that having a 
Womens Center promotes sexual segre
gation at CMU.
I was at the ASA meeting that took 
place during Orientation, and while there 
was only one other Caucasian there, her 
name was not Dave Liber. What Mr. 
Liber doesnt seem to realize is that 
CMU is already a white male Club.
If you were to break down the student 
body by gender and race, the overwhelm
ing majority would be white males, so 
why have a club?
On the other hand, if I was at a 
university in Borneo, I just might want 
one, and in that case, it would make a 
lot more sense.
Mr. Liber has a problem with these 
organizations being funded by the Uni
versity.
I would think that Mr. Liber would be 
better off attacking the system that 
gives the bureaucrats of CMU the right 
to take his money and redistribute it 
where they see fit, without his permis
sion, rather than attacking the orga
nizations themselves.
If I could choose where my money was 
going, Housing and student organiza
tions would have a lot more, and CMU 
Police would consist of three officers 
riding around in a yellow Dodge Omni. 
But thats where your personal agency 
and responsibility comes in.
If you want ASA to provide you with 
their services, then go join, and theyll be 
happy to do so.
But if you dont want to learn about 
Asian culture, then dont worry about it, 
and they wont bother you either. Just as 
I consider it my responsibility to tell 
people about the myth of freedom in a 
representative democracy, you should 
consider it yours to look beyond what the 
centralized power structure of CMU pre
sents to you and discover what the indi
vidual humans have to offer.

Editor:
Regarding Luke 
Brindles article [9/29] 
on President Clintons 
remarks on fast-track 
authority to negotiate
MERCOSUL and strengthen the U.S. 
position in the FTAA negotiations.
The important conclusion for the 
American political/diplomatic establish
ment is that trade negotiations with the 
Southern Cone require different strate
gies from previous dissimilar negotia
tions with Mexico. President Clintons 
upcoming state visit to Brazil and Ar
gentina may be an opportunity to foster 
mutual understanding, although, as of 
now, Mr. Clinton has not shown the 
willingness to go beyond the usual photo 
ops and politically correct speeches.

Letter to the Editor
trade deals with South American coun
tries, one point that is widely missed by 
the American media is that the cur
rent proposal to expand NAFTA to the 
entire hemisphere also faces signifi
cant opposition within the Southern 
Cone of the continent itself.
Unlike Mexico or Central America, 
which are highly dependent on the U.S. 
market, countries like Brazil, Argen
tina, and Chile are said to be global 
traders, meaning that the destination 
of their exports is more equally divided 
among a variety of regional markets, 
including not only the U.S., but also the 
European Union, the Asia-Pacific re
gion, and other Latin American coun
tries. The geographical diversification 
of the southern countries foreign trade 
reduces the urgency of a NAFTA-like 
association with the U.S.
An important factor in the equation 
was the creation in the early 90s of the 
Southern Cone Common Market (or 
MERCOSUL), originally a customs 
union including Brazil, Argentina, Uru
guay, and Paraguay, with later bilateral 
agreements with Chile and Bolivia. The 
success of MERCOSUL strengthened 
the position of the southern countries 
vis--vis the U.S. and enabled them to 
come to the trade summits with a com
mon position.
The problems in the trade negotiating 
process come in a time where the State 
Department is showing extreme incom
petence in its relations with the South
ern Cone. The recent decisions by the 
U.S. government to sell advanced jet 
fighters to Chile and to extend extraNATO preferential ally status to Argen
tina have caused tension in the region. 
On the other hand, Washingtons move 
to support a permanent Latin American 
seat in the U.N. Security Council has led 
to uneasiness between Brazil and Ar
gentina/Mexico. Above all, these moves 
are seen in the Southern Cone as rather 
childish attempts by Washington to 
break up the cohesion within
Editor:
James Stepanek 
asks, Why does any
one need a gun? but 
continues to give only 
a partial answer. The 
most important answer is stated clearly 
in our constitution. A well-regulated 
militia, being necessary to the security 
of a free State, the right of the people to 
keep and bear arms, shall not be in
fringed. Stepanek is only half correct 
when he says, Its simply about free
dom. It is also about life. The disarming 
of the German population in the 30s 
was a necessary precondition for the 
following Holocaust. While it is unlikely 
that any of the people supporting gun 
control in America have such designs, 
gun control will make another Holo
caust easier to pull off. Despite what the 
writers of our Declaration of Indepen
dence thought, the equality of man is not 
self-evident to everyone. In practice, it is 
due to the simple ability of any person to 
kill any other person. If some persons, or 
a people, allow their right to bear arms 
to be eliminated, they will become mili
tarily inferior and must depend on a 
superior group to protect them.
We have the choice of accepting a defi
nite loss of 10 or 15 lives every few years 
as someone with a gun flips out, or we 
can put ourselves at much greater risk 
of a few million lives being lost when 
only the crazy men have the guns. Please 
dont put all of us at risk of a Holocaust 
by telling yourself that it will never 
happen here. Obviously, the many mil
lion persons who died in Germany didnt 
believe that they would be killed by their 
government run amok.
Waiting periods before buying weap
ons and mandated training will not put 
our life and liberty at risk, but outright 
prohibition of weapons could be disas
trous. When we decide what weapons 
may be held by a regular adult citizen, 
the main criterion we should look at is 
whether the weapon is made for defense 
or for offense. We should not worry about 
what one psycho may do with the weapon; 
the vast majority of killings involving 
guns have been committed by regular 
men with the support of their communi
ties.

U.S. melting pot 
risks cooldown
David Liber
The United States is a nation 
made up of immigrants or de
scendants of immigrants. 
Whether your ancestors came 
over by the Bering Strait land 
bridge as did Native Americans, 
on a ship crossing the North 
Atlantic as, or on a Boeing 747 
from Hong Kong as many do 
today, we are all immigrants in 
some way. I freely admit that, 
as a nation, we have always 
been reluctant to welcome all 
immigrants to this country, and 
for mostly racist or bigoted rea
sons. However, even though 
Congress still maintains quo
tas on the amount of Europeans 
and Asians that may immigrate 
to this country, the attitude 
Americans have towards immi
grants has changed to some
thing totally different.
A belief in multiculturalism 
lias helped destroy the cliched 
idea of the melting pot and 
turned it into a tossed salad. 
This latter idea states that we 
must all keep our heritage and 
ancestral identity and coexist 
together instead of blending our 
cultural identities to form and 
contribute to the American cul
tural identity as a whole. This 
beliefin multiculturalism, while 
trying to be holistic in its re
spect to other cultures, is slowly 
tearing apart that national 
unity needed for any country to 
exist as one people in the world. 
The American cultural identity 
is not made up of Africans, 
Asians, and Europeans all ex
isting in our own separate com
munities wearing our traditional 
dress and eating our traditional 
food while respecting each other. 
The American cultural identity 
is made up ofNike-wearing, punkrock-listening Asians; classicalmusic-listening, Calvin-Kleinwearing Africans; and curriedtofu-eating, Pet-Shop Boys-listening, Structure-wearing Europe
ans. Yet this belief in 
multiculturalism denies people 
the right to give up their ances
tral heritage as they want so that 
they may assimilate.
Ah yes, assimilation  that 
dreaded word that frightens 
multiculturalists. Yes, we must 
all learn to assimilate in some 
way. To learn to speak English 
so we may communicate with 
each other; to learn what goes 
on a Big Mac, to learn the Pledge 
of Allegiance, the national an
them, and why every first Tues
day in November we show up at 
the polls to conduct the great 
democratic experiment.
We must all sacrifice some form 
of our heritage to assimilate into 
this nation. Only by assimilating 
do we have a say in the change; 
only by giving up some part of 
ourselves.For the sake of the 
United States and its existence 
as a nation, we must all learn to 
assimilate ourselves into this 
American cultural identity. Fail
ure means a loss of pride in our 
nation, its people, its communi
ties, its heritage, and the philoso
phies of Locke and Jefferson that 
give us this democratic heritage 
that, while flawed, is remarkable 
in the course of social history.

Quirks spice up CMU
r Justin C
The thickly stuffed envelope fit snugly in my 
grasp. It had a good, solid weight and ached to be 
torn open in wondrous frenzy. Carnegie Mellon 
was printed in enticing red letters accompanied 
by the strangely tilted square outline by its side. 
An even stranger cylin
drical architecture that 
we all now know adorns 
Hamerschlag Hall 
proudly situated itself 
amongst the mail that 
would change my life for
ever. I knew that this let
ter was different. All the 
other responses had been 
flimsy single page notes 
with stamped signa
tures, and unless this 
was a really well-articulated rejection letter, I 
had the optimism that I 
was finally in. But what 
was I about to enter?
Of course I had visited 
CMU and done my re
search prior to applying, but just as in any 
experience, you really have to be there to know. 
The essence of CMU had eluded me and, conse
quently, the culture had remained hidden. All I 
had known as my eyes grew wider observing the 
envelope containing the prospect of my future 
was that it had a unique name and a computer 
that couldnt print squares straight.
After I arrived and became situated in my 
new university life, CMU rapidly revealed its 
hidden nature. Visions of ivy, sun-drenched 
greenery, and the random interspersing of 
couples situated Indian-style under a grand
father oak were soon replaced by white brick 
arches, dark Pittsburgh days, and 24-hour 
work schedules.
Crisp autumn tailgates, and even the pre
tentious coat of arms upon the university 
entrance gate perceptibly transposed to 
thistles, terriers, and bagpipes.
As I continued to be integrated into this strik
ingly different college community, things got 
stranger. How do I get involved? Well, I have the
choice of either stuffing one of my smaller friends 
into a streamlined bubble and propelling him or 
her to the highest velocity possible, or maneuver
ing my very own robot through a series of complex 
curves to victory.
And what of school colors? Not one, not two, but 
a full-fledged pattern: Tartan Plaid.
Where were the stereotypes? What had hap
pened to that college that was so clearly depicted 
for me in the movies and on the brochures?
CMU took that idea and turned it upside-down.
Things are different 
here, strange, but 
unique and special. 
And as much as our 
S3,mbols and culture 
reflect the spirit and 
traditions of Carnegie 
himself, they have 
also evolved to create 
the peerless atmo
sphere of CMU as we 
know it today.
Things have defi
nitely changed, but 
they have done so to 
transform CMU into 
an altogether differ
ent institution.
From Booth to KGB, 
that which makesMark Adato/Tartan Art Staff
CMU CMU is found in the details. Our symbols 
and nuances of culture seem to define the school as 
a whole, and separate our student body from all the 
other generic clones.
Our differences at CMU become a bonus rather 
than a disappointment. They attribute individual
ity to all of the activities we see around us and that 
define what Carnegie Mellon stands for. These 
differences allude to the diversity of talent and 
character that we all know persists around us.
So when others look upon our unique community 
and perceive our student body as being crazy for 
continually painting the same fence over and over 
again, and when the rumors start to spread about 
mysterious campers courageously daring the bitter 
cold of Pittsburgh winter in defense of a paint job 
that really doesnt seem that altogether well done, 
think about the singleness of your experience and 
the challenging of perceptions you will bring to the 
curious bearer of the CMU envelope.

Cable television shuts off intellectual growth
Jeff Thibert
Theres been quite a bit of discussion around here 
these past few weeks regarding the installation of cable 
TV in the dorms.'
Before, we got the broadcast networks, but you had to 
pull some interesting contortions with the antenna in 
order to get a signal that didnt look like something out 
of that Bing Crosby classic, White Christmas.
At any rate, there are three basic opinions about the 
cable. Some people love it, some people hate it, and some 
.people dont care all that much. Does it matter, though? 
I dont think so. I think any problems (or benefits) lie in 
television itself, whether broadcast or cable  the 
.problem is far more general. It goes beyond cable TV at 
CMU to television in general at CMU j cable or not, 
.most of it is harmful. See, television is an excellent 
medium, but its misused constantly.
. People in general waste so much time watching 
television thatits astounding. Lets not talk about 
people in general, though  lets talk about people here 
,at CMU. Ill bet that a lot of people spend their Thursday 
nights watching the Thursday night shows on NBC. 
You know, Friends, Seinfeld, and the like. At any 
rate, I have a minor problem with this, because I just
cant understand why people here would want to spend 
their time in front of the television when there are so 
many more interesting, enlightening, and produc
tive things they could be doing, since theyre on a 
college campus.
Some might say, to counter me, that television actually 
brings people together. Well, I find it really odd how TV 
brings people together; it does it in an entirely imper
sonal way. Ive seen fairly large groups of people watch
ing TV and when the session is over, they all scatter to 
their respective corners.
Sure, during the show, they heckle the screen and 
maybe they chit-chat during the commercials, but how is 
this bringing anyone closer together?And maybe some 
just use television as a background noisemany people 
say they cant studywithout something going on, whether 
it be music, chatter, or the television. But even if you are 
using it just for background noise, there are backgrounds 
that would be more conducive to thinking  like classi
cal music, or nature sounds, or something.
The most common argument that people give regard
ing the worth of television is that its a wonderful relax
ation aid. Watching a comedy like Seinfeld is great 
because you get to laugh; watching a good drama lets you 
cry, or to emote in some other way. I havent been able to 
figure out sports yet. Maybe its nice to watch other 
people running around because we feel as if we, too, are 
being active, rather than lying around like bums. At any 
rate, I think the real reason people enjoy these shows is 
because they dont make you think. I mean, with com
edies, the jokes float in, and the laughs float out, but its 
hard to know exactly why youre laughing, and its 
hard to remember afterwards what you thought was 
so funny. Same goes for sadness with dramas, and 
excitement with sports.
TV doesnt always have to shut off your thinking, or 
make you passive, of course  its just that most of the 
popular shows do those things. There is good TV, or 
worthwhile TV, that can educate people, or cause 
some sort of inner reflection. Well probably have 
classes here over the television sooner or later, and 
there are some thoughtful shows that make you 
think meaningfully.
So Im not knocking all television, but more often than 
not, I think ignoring other pursuits to watch it is terrible 
 especially here. I mean, were at college! There are 
people you can talk to, there is research to be pursued, 
there are professors who would probably love to discuss 
your favorite subjects. There are plays to be seen, music to be 
heard, walks to be taken, books to be read, and self-reflection 
to be done. Id be perfectly happy if we lost the majority of the 
cable, and even most of whats on the standard networks  
lets just keep the things that are helpful. After all, college is 
supposed to be a time for growth, and how are we growing 
while were passively, transfixed in front of a screen? Well... 
maybe you can tell me.

Program. He welcomes, and even goes so far as to encour
age, respectful replies to his column.

It may sound surprising, but 
attraction does bloom at CMU. 
To prove that, we asked stu
dents: What aspect do you 
think about when checking 
someone out?

CARNEGIE MELLON POLICY ON UNIVERSITY FINAL EXAMINATIONS 
PREAMBLE
The Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of final examinations for the undergraduate 
courses (defined as courses that are numbered xx-6xx or below). These policies represent an understanding between 
faculty and students concerning an important but often stressful period at the conclusion of each academic semester. 
There should be no expectation that the following points will cover every conceivable situation. The student should 
anticipate the demands of the end-of-semesler schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty 
should recognize that the student is encumbered with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this 
period over which he or she has no control; expectations should be reasonably consistent with the number of course 
units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in advance of the final examination period.
DEFINITIONS
The university's official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of 
classes and continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s).
nation in the course, no classes other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. Review 
sessions should be scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort should be made to accommodate students 
who cannot attend. In appreciation of the time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, 
portfolio reviews, critiques, or juries shall be scheduled within four days of the final examination of the same course.
^"Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave earlier nor 
pressure students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examinations.
5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 24-hour period. A student 
who has more than two examinations scheduled within a 24-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the 
same time should contact first the instructor of the course for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the problem cannot 
be resolved by that means, the student should contact the associate dean of his or her home college.
6. Take-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the student's choosing during the final 
examination period.
 Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by Enrollment Services. An instructor may choose not to fix a 
schedule for the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are 
called self-scheduled examinations.
 Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering 
only a part of the course.
POLICIES
1. All scheduled final examinations are held at the end of the semester during the university's official final examina
tion period. Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the 
department or instructor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for 
examination purposes of any kind, unless a student opts to. take a self-scheduled examination during this time. Noncomprehensive final examinations or final projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period 
only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive examination.
2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than 72 hours before the final examination in the 
course. In cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided 
unless the final examination will not cover material in work that has not been returned.
3. No other course work, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final examination period unless 
it is assigned in advance and in lieu of the course's final examination. Regardless of whether there is a final exami
7. Students are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the examination; late arrival will 
reduce the total time a student has to complete the examination, unless instructor's course policy indicates otherwise. 
Instructors reserve the right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who miss an examination 
with a reasonable excuse and wish to petition for a make-up final examination should check with the instructor. 
Instructors are encouraged to include late arrival policy and make-up exam policy in the course syllabus.
8. Any student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final examination in the presence of an 
instructor or a teaching assistant. Any controversy arising from this review shall be dealt with in accordance with the 
university procedure for the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination which is not returned to a 
student will be kept available for a year for review. In the event that the instructor or teaching assistant is not available 
for the review, the responsibility shall rest with the department head of the instructor offering the course or his or her 
designee. Since instructors are expected to return all work assigned before the final examinations, they are not 
responsible for retaining unclaimed course work.
9. Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final examination policy or alterations of 
the final examination schedule should be directed to the department head of the instructor offering the course or to 
the associate dean of the student's home college.

Questions concerning this policy or its intent should be directed to: Edmond Ko, Vice Provost for Education, x8-

IT roles in global investment banking
No-one should underestimate what it will take to become 
one of the dominant players in the global investment 
banking market of the 21st century.
No-one should underestimate the absolute seriousness with 
which we're setting out to achieve that goal.
Our strategy hinges on pushing the power of information 
technology out from our domain into that of our customers
- giving our clients tools with which to make decisions on 
their overall risk management. Such an approach will lower 
the total cost of using derivatives in advanced strategies 
by bringing to bear the power of mathematics and leading 
edge technology.
We have total commitment from the banks most senior people, 
backed by massive investment - but they will be seeking 
early evidence of significant progress.
We have a mandate to think the unthinkable, subject only to 
the guiding principle of adding substantial, visible value.
Our IT team has a new nucleus of exceptionally talented 
individuals who already have an unrivalled reputation in 
developing radical banking IT solutions. They urgently seek 
new colleagues - based in London or in other financial 
centres across the world - who want to make their own 
reputations. People who are top-flight graduates and whose 
IT careers to date have already demonstrated the potential 
for outstanding achievement. Specifically, we need people 
who are already highly proficient in any of these areas -
or who could quickly become so in a company where 
training and development is high on everyones agenda.
Fully distributed global OO systems
Electronic commerce
Leading-edge risk management approaches
Advanced mathematics
Visual Studio, C++, ActiveX, Java, DCOM, CORBA, HOP, 
Orbix, Versant.
For a programme of such far-reaching, fundamental change, 
technical competence - even brilliance - is not enough. 
Because with our new focus on the ultimate customer, you 
need to be credible with top client management, and to 
make your proposals and ideas as clear to them as they 
are to you. You also need an exceptional and original 
intellect, the stamina to thrive on punishing workloads, 
and the desire to do things with new technology that have 
not been done before.
Software engineers, applications developers, systems 
architects - whatever you aim to be and whatever salary 
expectation you may have, we expect to better it.

An examination of classical Israelite prophecy 
shows it was characterized both by strong 
protests against social abuses, power politics, 
and religious hypocrisy, and by an urgent 
call to return to the roots of the Israelite 
faith. The presentation will focus on the 
prominent theological themes which typified 
the Old Testament prophets as they sought 
to remain faithful to God's word by making 
it a word heard in their day. It will conclude 
with a consideration of some implications of 
this study for prophetic witness in our day.

Sports personalities swap shows, cause scandals
Lifes a Sport
by Chris Cannon
As many of you know, a great transi
tion happened on July 1 of this past 
summer. Robert Mehrabian passing the 
torch to Jared Cohen? Nope. Hong Kong 
going back to China? Try again. How 
about Keith Olbermann leaving ESPNs 
nightly Sportscenter show? Bingo.
If you havent noticed the drop-off in 
humor from what was TVs funniest live 
show (including Saturday Night Live), 
its because Olbermann has hopped from 
the Disney-ABC-ESPN media-conglom
erate to the MSNBC version of media for 
the masses. Monday through Friday, 8- 
9 pm ET you too can see what the man 
who brought us Its deep and I dont 
think its playable, From way down
town, and Guh! is up to.
Keith Olbermanns The Big Show (a 
name that for
merly be
longed to his 
Sportscenter 
show) is ad
vertised as a 
newscast with 
a different set 
of rules!
So what new lev
els of journal

who never 
failed to an

sometimes even funnier than Olbermann 
and always meaner. Be sure to tune in 
Wednesday, when Janeane Garofalo is 
on. Garofalo and Kilborn have some spe
cial spark going on.
Speaking of announcers leaving net
works, its time to mention Marv. No 
base wig-jokes here, I want to discuss 
bites. Only in the world of sports can 
Mike Tyson be fined $3 million for two 
bites and Marv Albert $2,500 for at
For Olbermann, one of few sportscas]ters whos even spoken marginally 
against Albert, it might mean another 
job. Is there a law of conservation of 
sports announcers at NBC? Is this, an 
invasion of Sportscenter anchors into 
real news? Will Olbermann, like Horig 
Kong, be given back in 99 years? Or 
will Olbermann one day reveal himself 
to be a biting tranvestite when his 
lover doesnt bring a third for a good 
old three-some? As Mr. Olbermann

isnt the first sportscaster to leave ESPN. 
Former sportscaster Craig
Kilborn left two years ago for the greener 
pastures of Comedy Central and now 
hosts The Daily Show Monday through
least 17 distinct impressions on the skin. 
At 850 percent the number of bites for 1/ 
1200 the price, Marv got a lot more 
utility out of his munches.
Whats worse is how big media has 
treated the two cases. Tyson was front 
page news, but some magazines, nota
bly the National Enquirer, have refused 
to run stories on Albert.
What does this mean for announc
ers, who arent exactly new to scandal

Tartans win three tourney games
WIN, from page 16
never give up in our quest to win 
a match.
But Saturday, the gel that Webb 
has been waiting for all season 
had finally set. The team beat La 
Roche College for their first win, 
15-6,15-7, and 15-9. Each point 
was hard-fought, and in the last 
set, much celebrated over, as the 
women sensed their first victory 
at hand.
The bigger and stronger 
Bethany College forced the Tar
tans to work harder than the pre
vious team, but sophomore out
side hitter Ashley Kinsey took 
the defense to the floor digging 
hard to keep the ball in the air. 
Webb made smart substitutions, 
resting her starters with reserves, 
including sophomore Rachelle 
Abati, who stepped into play cold 
and pounded away.
CMU took two sets 15-7 and 
15-9, but lost the next two 6-15 
and 12-15. After almost two hours 
of play, the final set went to rally 
points where every play counted 
as points regardless of serve. 
CMU won 15-6, sealing their top 
spot in their pool and moving 
them on to play the second-place 
team in the opposite pool, Uni
versity of Pittsburgh-Johnstown.
Weve been playing like this 
all year, weve just played some 
really tough teams  and we 
could hang with them, but this 
is great, said assistant coach 
Patti Bruno.
With little rest between 
matches, CMU came out swing
ing; led by captain Brittany 
Rutter and Sekowski, the team 
beat up on UPJ15-8. The second 
set displayed team chemistry as 
they found UPJs 6-foot-tall 
middle player needed to be 
double-teamed. Szobota and 5'4" 
Putaro quickly put her down, 
sending the ball back into UPJs 
face. When you get a really good 
pass and good set, you can really
pound the ball, said Szobota.
CMU found a hole left by 
UPJs disoriented 5'10" middle 
hitter, attacking her and forc
ing errors to take the second 
game 15-5. They closed out the 
set with some fancy finger-work 
around the net; rolling the ball 
towards th UPJ floor, CMU 
blocked the J attempts at 
power aiid held onto a crushing 
15-3 win.
Lycoming was a challenge in 
the championship round, not al
lowing the Tartans to keep pos
session of the ball long, as they 
had managed to do most of the 
day  forcing them to work for a 
side-out. The first game featured 
great volleys but Lycoming came 
out on top 15-13.
In the second set, Kinsey and 
junior captain Jenn Sutherland 
played strong, but the team fal
tered, losing 8-15. CMU couldnt 
stop the booming smack of 
Lycomings huge middle and out
side hitters any longer, losing 8- 
15 again.
Abati and Szobota credited the 
passing and strong defense with 
much of the strength on the day. 
D was awesome and passing was 
fantastic, said Szobota.
Its the first time that we have 
really played together and 
though [Lycoming] was a better 
team, we played our hardest, 
said Kinsey.
The Tartans face Carlow College 
at Carlow at 6 pm on Thursday.

Atlanta Braves will win World Series once again
The Hot Corner
by Matt Cuccaro
Most of you baseball fans have seen so 
many playoff previews in the past week 
youll probably throw up if you see one 
more. Well, puke away kids, because heres 
another one! What I mean to say is that 
 here I am, simply offering to you my opinever pitching staff can be less miser
able. Andy Pettitte leads the Yankees 
staff, followed by an unhealthy Dave 
Cone, suspect David Wells, and, umm, 
Dwight Gooden. The Indians will un
fortunately depend on Orel Hershiser, 
Jaret Wright, and Charles Nagy. This 
borders on pathetic. However, both 
teams really know how to smack around 
the baseballs. Tino Martinez, Bernie 
Williams, and Paul ONeill pace the 
Yanks, but the powerful strokes of Jim 
Thome, Matt Williams, David Justice, 
and Manny Ramirez more than makes 
up for that of the Bronx Bombers, and 
that will make the difference in this 
series. Oh yeah, I hate the Yankees, 
too. Cleveland in five.
Mariners should have little trouble with the 
Tribe (unless they lose in the first round, in 
which case they would have a lot of trouble).1
; ion on the 1997 playoff picture. And even 
though half of the first round will be over 
before you read this, I made these picks 
. before the playoffs started. Trust me. 
New York vs. Cleveland 
This series will be decided by whichBaltimore vs. Seattle
In Mike Mussina, Jimmy Key, and 
Scott Erickson, Baltimore has quite an 
impressive set of starting pitchers. But 
Seattles trio of Randy Johnson, Jeff 
Fassero, and Jamie Moyer won more
games (53) than any other in the Ameri
can League. And if Seattle is going to 
win this series, their starting pitching 
has to be awesome. That is because the 
Mariners have the worst bullpen in the 
history of the playoffs. Led by fearsome 
closer Heathcliff Slocumb (0-9, 5.16), 
no lead is safe for the Ms. But 
theres no needtofear,Su
per Junior is 
here. Griffey 
Edgar Martinez 
Jay Buhner, and Alex 
Rodriguez lead a power
ful lineup that (probably) 
will not be shut down. My 
deep insight on the series is this:
If Seattle can play Mariner baseball 
like they know how, and keep the 
Orioles from doing what theyve 
been doing all year, I think 
theyll have a good shot at 
putting some Ws on the Q) 
board. My pick: Seattle in 
five games.
Florida vs. San Francisco
This series should provide 
a little more excitement than 
the Braves-Losers series, but 
not much. The Giants pitch
ing has surprised all year with 
Shawn Estes, Mark Gardner,
and Kirk Rueter having fine seasons, 
and mid-season pickup Wilson Alvarez 
has also done well. But in my opinion 
they cant compete with Kevin Brown and 
Alex Fernandez. Pirate fans know how 
well Barry Bonds has fared in the post
Atlanta vs. Houston
I think the Astros should be congratu
lated on their hard earned National 
League Central crown with some early 
plane tickets home. I see no need to even 
play this series. After Biggio and
season (career average. 190), and the rest Bagwell, Houston has no one that cap 
ofthe Giants hitters wont equal the timely touch the likes of Maddux, Glavine,
hitting Marlins. Florida in four.
orR :6eOiuM0ome9m2 3e9 F9m..
Smoltz, and Neagle. The mighty Bravejs 
are on a mission, and the Stros are tob 
weak to stop them. No surprises her: 
Atlanta in three.
League Championship 
and World Series 
In the American League 
Championship Series, th 
Mariners should have littlfe 
trouble with the Tribe (unless they 
lose in the first round, in which case they 
would have a lot of trouble). And while 
Florida owned Atlanta in the rgulai* 
season, the Braves will easily coast by the 
inexperienced fish here in October in the 
NLCS. In the Fall Classic, it will once 
again be all-Braves, the Team ofthe '90$.
Coox would appreciate it if, in fact, his 
column does make you want to throw up, 
you chose a different page to do it on. Hf 
would offer his suggestions as to which 
page if he didnt think he would be fired 
for doing so.

styles are a perfect match for the 
doubles game, and the fact that 
. they are both terrific tennis players
 in general certainly doesnt hurt.
Of course, almost all athletes 
are superstitious to some degree, 
and Brown is definitely the su
perstitious one on the team. I 
always take six sips of water on a 
changeover, and seven if its a tiebreak, said Brown. I bounce the 
ball three times before I serve, 
and two times on a second serve. 
The good karma seems to be 
working, and the doubles team 
feels confident going into the na
tional competition. I think we 
have a good chance at this tour
nament, said Mills. Its always 
a pretty good competition, and 
Im looking forward to it. The
combination of camaraderie, ex
perience and excitement that the 
duo possess bodes well for their 
chances of success during this 
tournament and for the spring 
season next semester. Mills sums 
up both the remarkable qualities 
of her own doubles team and the 
meaning of teamwork in gen
eral. We bring out the best in 
each other, said Mills.

Baseball club finishes fall 
season with tough losses
By STACEY REED
Tartan Staffwriter
The baseball club finished 
their fall season with two 
losses to the University of 
Pittsburgh at Greensburg this 
weekend. Despite scores of 8- 
3 and 15-6, they played to
gether as a team and their 
defense tightened up notice
ably during the doubleheader; 
they played like champs.
The infielders were talking 
to each other and yelling encouragement at the pitcher. i 
Whaddya say number 
eight?
Starting pitcher and fresh
man Brian Yuen responded 
with an awesome performance Z 
on the mound. Not only did he 
pitch well, buthe covered the plate 
for tags at home and made several 
difficult snags, all while keeping 
close tabs on the runners. This 
was Yuens thirdstartfor the team. 
I think this was my best start yet. 
Fve been working on building my 
arm strength, he said.
Jon Mayes relieved Yuen as 
pitcher in the fourth inning. 
His pitching was consistent, 
and well-liked by the opposition
 so much so that he gave away 
two home runs in the bottom of 
the sixth inning. He made up for
this by continuing his five-game 
hitting streak with a base hit that 
ended in an RBI.
Defense remained impressive 
during this game. We got to
gether this game and our defense 
held up. We had very few errors, 
said Mayes. Senior Ed Cudahy 
and junior Ramon Poo both had 
great games on the field. Cudahy, 
at first base, was responsible for 
several plays, making great stops 
and finishing the plays alone.
Poo caught everything within
Im a god.
 Tyler Burke 
sophomore catcher
his reach in left field. Even after 
being hit by a pitch earlier in the 
game, his performance at the 
plate was strong. He hit a double 
to left in the top of the seventh 
and stole several bases. CMU 
dropped the first game with a 
final score of Pitt 8, CMU 3.
The second game was almost 
over at the end of the second 
inning. Pitt went through their 
batting order like a little-league 
team, scoring ten runs during 
these two innings.
Team captain, senior Jay
McCormack, started the game on 
the mound, but was moved to 
shortstop in the second inning 
and Mayes relieved.
Beginning with a three-run home 
run from sophomore catcher Tyler 
Burke, scoring McCormack and 
Mayes, the team responded to the 
beating in the top of the third in
ning. Tm a god, said Burke.
Yuen, Cudahy, and junior Mike 
Porpora all had base hits while 
there were two outs during the 
same inning, but all three wer
- left on base.
Team captain McCormack 
had a solo home run in the top 
of the sixth inning, after tak
ing one for the team in the 
fourth inning.
Moral of the story: get hit by 
a pitch, bat like a pro.
The outfield got a little exercise 
during this game. Poo and cocaptain senior Jon Zubiller were 
all over the grass, robbing Pitt of 
base hits, but it wasnt enough to 
recover from the damage done at 
the beginning of the game. Pitt 
took the game 15-6.
The club finished its fall sea
son with a record of 1-7. They 
are on hiatus until the spring 
semester. I look forward to the 
spring season and to seeing some 
new names on the roster, said 
coach Bob Janeda.

Pair excels in doublesComeback kills CMU
By RYAN E. WILLHITE
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU football team made 
their return home last Satur
day, to meet rival Dickinson
yards in 12 plays ending with a 5- 
yard run by HB Chris Neupaver. 
After Dickinson fumbled the ball, 
CMU quickly took advantage. The 
Tartans went 69 yards in four 
plays. This put the Tartans up

After leading 30-9 in the fourth quarter, the Tartans couldnt get a 
hold of Dickinson, losing 44-37 in double overtime.
College. However, the Tartans 
were disappointed as Dickinson 
College won a thrilling double 
overtime game, 44-37.
The game started out fast for 
the Tartans as they raced 70 
yards in six plays and jumped 
out to a 7-0 lead. The touch
down came off of a 6-yard run 
by RB Mike Campie. Dickinson 
responded quickly with a field 
goal on their next possession.
With the score at 7-3, the Tar
tans went on a tear. On their 
next drive, the Tartans drove 80
21-3 and brought the first quar
ter to an end.
The second quarter started off 
a bit slower than the first. Nei
ther team took advantage on of
fense as both teams punted away 
their first possessions. On the 
Tartans second possession, they 
reasserted themselves. With sec
ond and 20 at the Dickinson 35, 
QB Tom Pirosko threw a 3 5-yard 
touchdown pass to WR Ricco 
Parrish. This put CMU up 27-3 
at halftime, and the rout was on.
However, coming out of halftime, Dickinson had other plans. 
On their second possession of the 
half, they marched 64 yards in 
eight plays and received a touch
down. The touchdown came off of 
a 20-yard pass from QB Dan 
McGee to WR Mike Bright. After 
a failed two-point conversion, the 
score was 27-9 entering the 
fourth quarter.
The Tartans responded by 
opening the fourth quarter with 
a 45-yard field goal to put CMU 
ahead 30-9. Then, the unbeliev
able occurred. With CMU up 30- 
9, Dickinson put on a show that 
only Reggie Miller would love.
On Dickinsons next possession 
with third-and-seven on their own 
18, QB McGee threw an 82-yard 
pass to WR Dwayne Shoemaker. 
After the extra point, the score 
was 30-16. On the ensuing kickoff, Dickinson caught CMU off 
guard with an onside kick. 
Dickinson recovered the kick and 
went 55 yards in five plays for 
another touchdown. The touch
down was the result of a 13-yard 
pass to Bright.
Leading 30-23, CMU tried to 
regain control. But, with third and 
seven to go on their 38, QB Russ 
Clay was sacked for a loss of eight.
Dickinson wasted no time on 
their next possession. Working 
with second and 19 at their 39, 
McGee connected with Bright for 
a 61-yard touchdown. Dickinson 
moved 86 yards in six plays on 
the drive. The score was now knot
ted at 30.
CMU had another chance to 
regain the lead as they attempted

CMUs womens volleyball won their 
first match ofthe season, including three 
in a row to power them to second place in 
their own six-team tournament this past 
weekend. Every element, from the 
matching light green, blue and yellow 
scrunchies that each player wore in her 
hair to the quick, definitive passing 
around the court, showed the unity of 
this squad.
Much of the teams success can be 
attributed to the triumphant return of 
sophomore middle hitter Steph Szobota, 
whose 5'11" height and incredible pres
ence up front was just what the Tartans 
needed to finish the games with the 
points to seal victory.
It feels so great. Its wonderful to be 
back. Things are looking up, said 
Szobota, who, along with sophomore set
ter Sarah Putaro, won a spot on the all
tournament team.
Budda was so great in the middle, 
said sophomore Beth Sekowski, referring to Szobotas nickname, which the 
team chanted from the bench while she 
received her award for the tournament.
The team had struggled in the previ
ous weekend, dropping eight straight 
matches at the UAA Tournament in 
Rochester. They lost in straight sets to 
six teams and then, heartbreakingly, 
Brandis 13-15, 8-15, 15-8, 6-15, 13- 
15. The last set of that match was typical 
of a problem that 
Coach Julie Webb is 
trying to get the team 
to work through.
We lose so many 
games by two points, 
its awful. We will just 
work harder in prac
tice this week and 
play our best all of the 
time. If that brings us 
a win, great, and if it 
doesnt, its OK be
cause we are playing 
our best. But that 
doesnt mean that we 
like it, she said. The Tartans dug in
The Tartans were a 0-18 team, but 
Webb was not daunted, pointing out 
that the average digs per match were 
up to over 11. The competition is just 
so tough at UAAs and those teams 
were more talented than we are, said 
Webb. The other coaches just love our 
team because we are fighters and never 
give up. Our spirits are up, and we will

CMUs Crew competed Saturday with 
over3,900otherparticipantsinthe 11th 
annual Head of the Ohio, the second 
largest event of its kind in the nation.
The competitors, which included the 
Canadian, German, and U.S. national 
teams, raced down a 3.1-mile stretch 
of the Allegheny River and finished 
almost at the point. Because of the 
enormous amount of competitors, 
teams raced down practically one af
ter the other the entire day, rather 
than in separate heats.
Its going from technique and train
ing to more hard core, club president 
senior Klaus Moser said of the progres
sion the team is trying to make. The 
team is trying to get past the technical 
stage of just rowing together to compet
ing and winning. According to Moser, 
this was the first time the mens group 
had rowed together competitively.
Themens-eightfinishedthe 5 Kcourse 
in a time of 13:40.5, tenth out of 12 club 
teams. The Canadian team had the fast
est eight-man boat, with a time of 
12:42.6. The womens-four was 13 of 20 
clubs at 16:48 over the same distance.
Fundraising tents lined the north side 
of the Allegheny, directly across from 
down-town. The team arrived at 7:30 
am, two hours before their first races and 
stayed, competing twice, until the late 
afternoon. During the long layoff be
tween races, the team was careful to stay 
out ofthe Saturday sun and to eat correctly.
I dont eat too much before a race, 
said Thomas McElroy, who limits him
self to grains, fruits, and water. Because 
ofthe nature of the exercise, Crew mem
bers take a little extra care as to what they 
let sit in their stomachs. Part of [rowing] 
is using your abs. Youre sort of compress
ing and decompressing your stomach. 
The men rowed without Julian Kinal, 
there top rower from last year, whos 
nursing a sore back. He hopes to be back 
and competing in four weeks. Kinal didnt 
let his sidelined status keep him from 
supporting his teammates.
I got on one bridge, raced down; just 
caught them, shouted; went down to 
another bridge, shouted, said Kinal, 
describing his efforts to cheer the team 
on a borrowed bicycle. One reason for 
the popularity ofthe event is Pittsburghs 
picturesque bridges.
This is a nice course because on the 
second half theres all the bridges, said 
Amy Ng. On most other courses theres 
nothing to see.
Kinal, an architecture student, is de
signing a river-side indoor sports arena 
as a class project. Itd be kind of nice ifthis 
race was five weeks ago, then Fd have 
gotten my site data while I was here. 
The teams were pleased with their 
times, but look forward to improving.
We were goingagainst international com
petition and we wanted to give our best, 
said Moser. All and all, were optimistic.

In Hollywood, the story of a 
spunky rookie being paired with 
a cool veteran has become some
thing of a movie clich. However, 
for Elisabeth Brown and Keri 
Mills of the CMU Womens Ten
nis team, its a storyline that 
couldnt be more true to life.
At the 1997 
Womens Rolex 
Northeast Region 
championships,
Mills, a junior from 
Houston, won the 
singles title for the 
third year in a row, 
while freshman 
Brown finished 
third after initially 
being seeded sev
enth. The two then 
paired up to sweep 
through the 
doubles competi
tion without losing 
a set to take the 
title. While many 
schools bring at 
least four people to 
the tournament, 
the CMU duo bested them all 
 they brought the fewest ath
letes but took home the most 
trophies. What all this means 
is that the doubles team ad
vances to the Rolex National 
Small College Championships 
in Memphis, Tennessee in two 
weeks, while Mills will play in 
the singles competition.
That Mills and Brown have 
achieved remarkable success af
ter being paired for only a short
time is a testament to how well 
their individual approaches to the 
game and styles of play comple
ment one another. Doubles ten
nis is indeed a team sport, and 
simply pairing the two best play
ers on the squad does not guaran
tee that a team will do well. In 
this case, however, Browns enerment. She can sympathize with 
her partners anxiety. [As a 
freshman] I didnt know what to 
expect. Its not the same level of 
play as in Texas. In a game 
where mental attitude is every
thing, the pair seem to balance 
each other well.
[Elisabeth] brings energy; she
getic attitude and Mills voice of is really pumped up out there, 
experience prove to be the perfect said Mills. Her partner readily
responds: I get 
really psyched 
in doubles! But 
dont count out 
emotion from 
Mills, either. 
During the first 
game of the fi
nal doubles 
match, Brown 
watched her 
partner return 
overhand lobs 
from the other 
team while 
shouting, Come 
on! Bring it on! 
The combina
tion of enthusi
asm and expe
rience means 
the team can 
maintain an even keel and keep 
their play steady throughout 
the match.
The mental part of the game 
isnt the only aspect in which the 
pieces fit together nicely. Brown 
describes herself as A baseline 
player. I usually dont come to 
the net unless I have to. Mills, 
on the other hand, plays more of 
a full court style, and doesnt 
mind going to the net. Their

Feminist ideals

Mira Schor is an artist con
sumed by -isms. She believes 
her work takes place at the 
intersection of three -isms: 
modernism, feminism, and 
postmodernism.
Schor, a painter and writer 
I from New York City, spoke last 
Thursday in McConomy Audifrom her dreams and repre-, 
sented self-discovery and 
sexual exploration. In these 
early works, Schor included an 
image of herself as a way to 
insert her personal narrative 
irito the work.
Schor explained that she 
stepped away from the tradi
tional paintbrush and easel in 
the late 70s and used her hand
writing as a medium to express

Mira is one of those, rare 
persons who combines practice 
and theory in a very symbiotic 
way. Shes an accomplished 
painter and also a much pub
lished and quoted writer about 
art, said Faith Wilding, a vis
iting professor in the School of 
Art and a college classmate of 
Schors.
Schor attended the feminist 
art program at California In
stitute of the Arts where she 
began a career that would un
dergo several changes in direc
tion, but would always focus on 
feminist ideals. One of the rea
sons that I was attracted to 
feminism was that I was inter
ested in bringing into art a per
sonal narrative. At a point in 
my early 20s, [I wanted, to] use 
art as a place to watch myself 
grow and understand my own 
growth, said Schor.
Schors first work after col
lege, a series of paintings called 
Story Paintings, was derived
ground so that it stood at eye 
level with a man of average 
height. A man walking up to

some of the writing illegible.

this work seemed very aggres

ures] were so delicate, but in 
their own space just hover

apparently makes [the men] 
quite nervous, Schor said.
The next works Schor showed 
were from the early part of this 
decade. These pieces continue to 
rely on Words to paint a political 
message. In 1991, after the con
clusion of the Gulf War, Schor 
decided to create a circular paint
ing'that would run around the 
walls, of a room. She worked on 
the piece, War Freeze, for four 
years, but never finished it.

Hoppers mind. He studies 
words; he writes about 
words; he teaches words. 
Language has always been 
the one thing that has fasci

Hoppers intense work in 
discourse studies, grammaticalization, and linguistics 
has enabled him to be re.

Peter Stearns, chaired professors 
are recognized for extraordinary ac
complishments. Funds for some 
chairs are given by donors who want 
to assist the University or a special 
program within the University.
According to David Kaufer, head
of the English Department, the 
Baker Chair was establishedin 1969 
by the estate of the second presi

instructing at CMU does not 
compare to instructing at any

the students are so very sharp 
and articulate. They are easy to 
get along with and eager to learn.

chose to stay here in Pittsburgh. 1 have always been 
interested in personal ideas but having some public
contribution. I love it here in Pittsburgh because you 
can contribute and see the contribution, said Dorsey.
For Dorsey, bringing his art back to CMU was 
a great reminder of the past. I feel rooted here; I > 
am proud of my roots, said Dorsey. Also, bringing 
his art to CMU gave Dorsey the chance to look - 
back on the past three years of his life and reaf
firm what he is doing. The show gave Dorsey a  
chance to breathe after the death of his mother, an 
event which took place within the past three ; 
years. It also gave him confidence as an artist and - 
a chance to see how his abilities relate to each' 
other and with the world.
[The show is] very touchy and moving and  
interesting, said Seldon Yuan, a senior in hu
manities and arts.
While the pressure at CMU turned him away 
from art, his trip abroad to France showed him the 
true value of art to the comrmmity. Working on 
community projects at CMU allowed Dorsey to 
experience the full diversity of the campus. [CMUs] 
diversity was one reason [I] came here, said Dorsey.
Dorsey urged students who have questions to 
call him. He says one major factor in his success 
was not limiting himself to the department alone. 
He recommends that students interested in doing similar things should get involved with some< 
thing in the community and to network. Use CMU  
as a great resource  it has so many connections 
but dont be limited by that, said Dorsey.

Who doesnt enjoy walking across 
The Cut at dusk in the spring, watch
ing the sun set and listening to the 
Pipe and Drum band? Its truly a CMU 
experience, and part of the reason for 
that is because CMU is only one of 
seven or eight colleges in the United 
States with such a group. Not only are 
we unique to have such musical talent, 
but CMUs Pipe and Drum band are 
also frequent award winners.
The [win] at the Ligonier Highland 
Games was probably the most impor
tant to us because it was close to home 
and almost all of the local Pipe bands
were there competing against us, said 
Larry Allen, drum instructor.
Allen said that the Pipe and Drum 
band is especially good this year, having 
competed in four contests and taken 
first place in three of them, including 
the recent win at Ligonier. They came in 
second overall in the fourth competition, 
and the drum line is undefeated in indi
vidual rankings. The CMU Pipe and 
Drum band must contend with some of 
the more established bands which prac
tice all year long and have been playing 
together for many years.
The turnover that the band experi
ences and the fact that they can only 
practice nine months of the year should 
make it difficult for the Pipe and Drum
band to succeed against this kind of 
competition, but they overcome the odds 
almost every time.
Weve been very close [to winning the 
National Championship] because nor
mally when we go, we win, said Allen. 
In 1995, we finished fourth overall. 
Last year we came in second overall and 
won the Champion Supreme Contest, 
which is almost like a National Contest, 
but the bands are awarded twice as 
many points toward the overall win.
According to Allen, there is usually a 
Pipe and Drum competition every week
end, although CMU only competes in 
seven to eight a year spanning from the 
late spring to early fall. There are over 
a hundred other Pipe and Drum bands
in CMUs grade IV division, and seven 
local groups. Compare that to the seven 
or eight universities throughout the 
nation which have Pipe and Drum 
bands, including The Citadel and St. 
Andrews College, and its easy to see 
that CMU has a valuable resource in 
the talented group.
I think we are starting to get a lot 
more recognition. We had a really big 
crowd after we played at freshman con
vocation and more people wanted to 
sign up than I had ever seen, said 
Allen. Its really rewarding for me; Iin 
very serious about [the group]. I think 
if the University really puts some en
ergy behind this thing, theres no limit 
to what we can do.
D1Tue9i ilmeu Q2rLauOsu 9lerksl -29ueg6uL
If you could talk to anyone, dead or 
alive, who would it be? What would you 
ask? These questions have always been 
popular after-dinner conversation sparkers, but with new technology that has 
been developed at CMU, these questions 
are no longer hypothetical in some cases.
For example, would you like to ask 
Albert Einstein a few questions ? Thats a 
real possibility with Synthetic Interviews.
Dr. Scott Stevens, senior systems scien
tist in the HumanComputer Interaction 
Institute, developed 
Synthetic Interviews 
along with Don 
Marinelli, an associate 
professor of drama.
The two are co-direc
tors of the Entertain
ment Technology Cen
ter (ETC), which is a 
joint program between 
the School of Computer 
Science and the Col
lege of Fine Arts.
The ETC believes it 
is possible to combine 
the strengths of 
drama and technol
ogy to develop cutting-edge projects 
that can provide 
unique educational experiences for stu
dents studying in the field while at the 
same time furthering multimedia, en
tertainment-related research initia
tives.
Stevens shared some of the back
ground behind Synthetic Interviews and 
some of the interesting aspects of the 
Einstein Interview.
The Tartan: Can you explain what Syn
thetic Interviews are?
Scott Stevens: Its a lot easier to show 
than tell. The idea is to try to create a 
one-on-one between a person and a 
synthetic person. If you think about 
chat rooms  theyre a one-on-one 
between a celebrity and a lot of people. 
But with this kind of technology, our 
goal was to recreate a computer em
bodiment ... so that you could sit down 
and talk to [the person].
This grew out of work we were doing in 
many areas and came out of the knowl
edge that computers we have in the 
home just about have the power to take 
things out of the lab and put them to use.
TT: Why chooseEinstein for a Syn
thetic Interview?
SS: There are a couple of reasons. We 
did this for the 50th anniversary of the
conference was we had Einstein on a 3D 
projector so Einstein literally floated out 
in space so you could just walk up and talk 
to him. We probably had a couple thou
sand people talk to Einstein. One janitor 
came by every morning to say hello to Al.
TT: Who played the part of Einstein in 
the Interview?
SS: Jerry Mayer, a professional actor 
from New York. Don Marinelli knew 
him. He actually wrote a one-act called
Association for Computing Machinery 
(ACM), the Computer Science profes
sional association. Raj Reddy, the dean of 
Computer Science, was invited to give a 
talk.... He knew of our work and asked us 
to put together a presentation. When 
ACM heard about it, they were inter
ested. We wanted to pick an interesting 
character whom everyone had heard of 
and who was also in the realm of science.
We went everywhere from fourth grade 
classes to different Internet groups and 
asked them, If you could ask Einstein 
one question, what would it be? We had 
quite a few hundred questions that were 
returned from these people. There is 
also a lot that Einstein has written, so 
we went to those books to find appropri
ate answers to some questions.
The other thing we did at the ACM
You Know Al, Hes a Funny Guy, and 
performed it at CMU. We hired him not 
only because he understood about 
Einsteins life, but he also had a lot of 
insight into his work.
TT: Are there going to be more Syn
thetic Interviews?
SS: One of the things we are trying to 
do now is something with Herb Simon. 
University Archives has a lot of resources 
for us, and hes agreed to let us do some 
interviews with him as well. We hope to 
have the ultimate Herb Simon Web site.
TT: What is the larger purpose of the 
Synthetic Interviews?
SS: In general, access to experts doesnt 
scale very well. To be able to capture 
some piece of experts and take care of 80 
percent of the possible questions for that 
expert is a goal.
Another goal is to build the Interview 
over time and add more and more infor
mation so that all questions get covered.
TT: Has Einstein ever missed a 
question posed to him?
SS: We arent perfect. When we were 
out at the conference, there were 30 to 
40 legitimate questions that we missed. 
But one person asked, Why are 
lips black? Well, we didnt think wed 
get a question like that. If we dont 
understand the question, 
we have defaults like 
Thats illogical or I dont 
understand. But if we 
were to develop Einstein 
more, we would capture 
those [obscure] questions 
and build up answers over 
time.
TT: What benefits do the 
Interviews bring to CMU?
SS: Hopefully in the long 
run, well have more acces 
to people like Herb Simon. 
And there are a number of 
students who are working 
on these projects, so we 
want to work toward ia 
graduate program. We 
have a golden opportunity 
between the [School of] 
hmRui Cr7r226ue0oartan Art Staff Computer Science and tKe
School of Drama. Weve also gotten a lot 
of positive feedback from places like 
Disney Interactive, places that would 
love to have students come out of 
program like what we are planning on 
and I think in order for students, to have 
that opportunity, they need to work on 
cutting-edge material in order to posi
tion themselves in the marketplace.
TT: Whos the one person with whom 
youd like to have a Synthetic Interview?
SS: Thats a rough one. I think it 
might be Thomas Jefferson. My favorite 
monument in Washington, D.C. is the 
Jefferson Memorial. The things he had 
to say were so right-on, all so poetic. I 
think itd be fun to sit down and havera 
conversation with him. Weve been toy
ing with doing a Synthetic Interview 
with Marilyn Monroe, too, so....

will address issues concerning primate 
communication and ways in which hu
mans relate to it.
Chimpanzees are trained to do some
thing analogous to human language. 
This is important in that we can find out 
what language is, Hopper said.
In addition, Hopper plans to teach an 
upper-level undergraduate English gram
mar course next semester. For the class, 
Hopper will use a book he has written, The 
Grammar of Standard Written "English.
Grammar is so very important. As a 
linguist, I think of grammar simply as 
something we are supposed to know. 
People misunderstand grammar. Its 
much more than the structure of things 
we say or write, he said.
I can remember at age 11,1 loved dia
gramming sentences, he said. Ive always 
thought as a teacher and researcher. I 
flirted with journalism, but Ive always 
come back to teaching, he said.
According to Barnard, Hoppers love 
for teaching has a direct impact on 
his students.
Dr. Hopper developed interesting 
class activities that excited the students. 
He relates the coursework to our inter
ests and our needs as developing writcourtesyof Paul Hopper
Hoppers unique contributions to the CMU community qualify him for this Chair.
ers. Overall, the reason he is such a 
compelling instructor is that he is very 
knowledgeable in the field of discourse 
analysis. The passion for his studies 
pours over into the classroom, she said.
When hes not teaching, Hopper spends 
a great deal of time writing books. His 
first book, Comparative Germatics, deals 
with syntax and the early stages of lan
guage. The book also reconstructs the 
earlier syntax of grammar.
In his book Grammaticalization, co
written with a Stanford professor, 
Hopper exposes the ways in which 
language creates grammar.
For example, when you say Mary is 
going to have a baby, the word going 
does not mean motion, but rather it 
indicates the future tense, said Hop
per. Language is full of this. Lan
guage uses ordinary words and action 
to create grammar.Language conveys life for artist
WORDS, from page LI
One panel of the painting that she 
showed consists of the words, Pub(l)ic 
Hair going down into a blood-filled toi
let. She got the idea for the panel after 
hearing about the Clarence Thomas/ 
Anita Hill hearings. Another panel works 
off the phrase, Its the economy, stu
pid, from President Clintons first cam
paign. She painted the words Its mod
ernism, stupid to look bloody and hairy 
and made the suffix -ism to look like it 
js going down into another blood-filled 
toilet. The flushing of -ism reflects 
Schors freedom from artistic and politi
cal movements.
Schor has continued to paint with
words. She said that she still refers to 
the body as in her early work, but now 
she does it entirely through language. 
Explaining the transition in her work, 
Schor said, You have to go where your 
work takes you.... There might be a time 
when Ill return to a work that is more 
polemic, which I think is what people 
are thinking about when they think of 
political art.
For now, Schor says shell continue to 
use color and shape to portray words 
and their meanings with less obvious 
political overtones. She explained that 
in her latest works, she is trying to take 
oil painting to the edge.
One painting that she worked on last
spring has the word black broken up 
into a series of paintings. She created a 
tar-like look with the paint. Schor said, 
Not only is my painting more out of 
control, but it seems that the words I 
want to be speaking are more uncertain. 
Complementing her work as a prac
ticing artist, Schor is also an editor 
and a writer about art. From 1986 to 
1996, Schor was co-editor ofM/E/A/ 
NII/N/G, a magazine she helped to 
begin when she could not find a forum 
for her writing. Her most recent book, 
Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art 
Culture, is a collection of essays that 
addresses issues central to the prac
tice and theory of postmodern art.
Association honors Health Services
ACCREDITATION, from page LI
 lealth Services within the student body 
-'ary greatly. They do what they can, 
and what they cant handle, they refer 
uo someone who can, said Javier 
Sanchez, a senior music major.
- Many students complained that 
Health Services wasnt open on week
ends, a fact that has been corrected 
now, since it is open from 11 am to 3 pm 
on Saturdays.
When you go into health services, 
you have to wait and make an appoint
ment before you can see the nurse. And,
if youre sick, you dont want to be wast
ing time, you want to be in bed, and 
then you have to come back later on and 
wait again. One time I called to make 
an appointment and I couldnt get in for 
three days, said Steve Diamante, a 
sophomore chemistry major.
Health Services saw over 16,000 stu
dent visits last year. We could never 
handle that amount of cases if we saw 
everyone on a walk-in basis, Barkin 
said. If you walk in and have a cold, 
no, Im not going to see you this 
minute. However, most students are
usually seen on the same day or 
within 24 hours of making an ap
pointment, and in emergency situa
tions, no person is going to be .de
nied treatment just because they 
dont have an appointment.
Barkin hopes that students will take 
this accreditation as a sign that there 
is a quality health care service on 
Carnegie Mellons campus. If you 
dont feel youve received proper care, 
or youre not happy, Im always will
ing to hear about what patients have 
to say, said Barkin.
Stereotypes hurt 
Womens Center
r
1 .
' ^_____y
Cracking the Myth
by Elizabeth Irvine
Feminism is a negative word. The best 
example of this is easily found at CMU. 
The campus Womens Center is constantly 
associated with negative connotations 
that it cant shake. No matter how many 
outreach programs, lectures, or social 
activities it provides, the Womens Cen
ter is always seen as an enigmatic, frivo
lous organization. Most people think its 
an exclusive organization with a highly 
political agenda. How many times in my 
four years here have I heard that the 
Womens Center is unnecessary? Why 
isnt there a mens center? is a question 
always used as a cpunterargument. Many 
times I have heard snide or malicious 
comments about a poster advertising a 
lecture the Center has sponsored.
Even though the Womens Center is
dissatisfied with the present state of 
things are often portrayed as de
pressed, militant and frightening. 
Feminists are shown in the media as 
man-hating, angry, and strange. They 
become the other to women in 
America. American women are sup
posed to embody contentment and se
curity. News programs and periodi
cals constantly make American women 
aware that they have it so much better 
than women in other parts of the world. 
So, women who arent satisfied, who 
see injustice in the everyday, are con
sidered ungrateful.
Women have been historically con
structed to not be angry. Tradition
ally, women are the calm, quiet ones 
who stabilize the home. Discontent
ment, although negative in both men 
and women, is far more acceptable 
in men. For example, in Rebel With
out a Cause, James Deans rebellion 
was problematic, but at the same 
time, because he was male, his dis
content was a product of his envi
ronment, so the viewer can sympa
thize with him.
When women rebel, their mental 
stability comes into question. Society 
doesnt want women to have angry
Groups with different focuses dont seem 
to be as threatening as the Womens Cen
ter.... Even on a university campus, where 
one would think people would be open to 
new ideas, feminists are marginalized. 
an object of ridicule, other womens 
organizations dont seem to receive as 
much criticism. Groups with different 
focuses dont seem to be as threaten
ing as the Womens Center, with its 
liberal agenda. Even on a university 
campus, where one would think people 
would be open to new ideas, feminists 
are marginalized. Cultural studies 
classes that focus on feminist issues 
are often questioned as a necessary 
part of the curriculum. The general 
campus population tends to wonder if 
there is any validity to these courses. 
Unlike physics or statistics, cultural 
studies courses are seen as threaten
ing the status quo, which tends to 
make people a little uncomfortable.
Those who choose to go against the 
status quo are stigmatized. People who 
are, passionate about the environment, 
race equality, world peace, or are simply
feelings, and as a result, the social 
conditions which are causing this re
bellion are ignored and the problem 
becomes internalized in the woman. 
People are usually uncomfortable 
when men question institutions as 
well, but when they do, the general 
public is more apt to pay attention to 
what issues they are addressing. Male 
rebellion, while problematic, has the 
potential to bring about change. But 
when women rebel, it brings up inter
nal disorder inherent in them.
The Womens Center is seen as a 
strange negative place because soci
ety dictates that it is not needed. It is 
abnormal, because it goes against the 
norm. Its unfortunate that the 
Womens Center is stigmatized, be
cause if students could get beyond 
their misconceptions offeminism, they 
could benefit from what it offers.

All early U.S. Interstate Highways were built with a 
straight, one-mile stretch every five miles so that planes 
could land there during wartime. Furthermore, all east-west 
interstates are numbered even, while all north-south interstates 
are odd-numbered. You can always figure out where you are 
because the east-west Interstates were numbered starting in 
the south, and the north-souths in the west (Route 1 runs 
through California). Pass it on.

Seven Years in Tibet opens October 8.
want to get into an argument with any 
Brad Pitt fans, but that reference does 
not make me very anxious to see a movie.
The film begins when Pitts character, 
Heinrich Harrer, embarks from Nazi
Germany on an expedition to climb the 
Himalayas Nanga Parbat peak. Harrer 
leaves his pregnant wife behind, and we 
hear Pitt say in a bad German accent, We 
have discussed this before, I am going to 
the Himala-YAS! Not too promising. 
Luckily, from that point on, the movie 
progresses by leaps and bounds.
Harrer and the expedition 
team led by Peter 
Aufschnaiter, played by David 
Thewlis, are sent off to 
Himalayas, where we see some 
breathtaking views of the se
rene mountains. This phase of 
the movie is cut short when 
World War II erupts and the 
British take the expedition 
team as prisoners of war. The 
crew is sent to a prison camp 
in the southern foothills of the 
Himalayas.
Harrer is determined to es
cape back to his home country of 
Austria. After many solo at
tempts, he manages to escape 
with another group of prisoners, 
including his former expedition 
captain Peter. Once outside of the com
pounds, Harrer leaves the rest of the 
prisoners to make his way alone to
wards the Himalayas.

The Philadelphia Story, which opened 
Friday in the Kresge Theatre, is a rich 
and enjoyable, if a little old-fashioned, 
romantic comedy about the aristocratic 
Lord family and the turmoil they go 
through when two magazine reporters 
come to write a story on how they live. 
The story centers on Tracy. Lord 
Dagmara Dominczyk) and her soon-toe second husband George Kittredge 
(Paul Domencic). The reporters have 
come to the Lord home to write about the 
upcoming wedding, but duringthe course 
of the play, Tracy begins to question her 
love for George when she is won over by 
the timid charms of one of the reporters, 
Mike Connor (Michael Zlabinger).
This leads into some of the plays subtextual issues of class and independence. 
Tracy is a fiery, hard-to-please, qickto-anger divorce who, through the 
course of the play, is softened into a 
more accepting, more yare (easy-tohandle) woman with a capacity to for
give human frailty.
To our eyes it looks as though Tracy 
goes from an independent, free-think
ing woman to a submissive and, well, 
yare wife.
But if one forgives Philip Barrys play, 
which is almost. 60 years old, the Drama 
Departments production of it becomes a 
moving experience. Superbly directed
by Dexter Fidler, the show is seamless 
and captivating. The actors make full 
use of the stage and S. Scott Welborns 
beautiful set, but they dont look as 
though thats what theyre trying to do. 
One never sees the actors at work, with 
the possible exception of Dagmara 
Dominczyk, who appears to be trying so 
hard for a high class voice, endlessly 
drawing out all the vowels, that she 
comes off at the start like a Katherine 
Hepburn impression.
But Dominczyk grew on me, and by 
the middle of act II, I was admiring her 
mannerisms and facial expressions, 
which spoke of her characters emo
tional turmoil. Equally convincing is 
Adam Donshik as C.K. Dexter Haven, 
Tracys first husband. He is clearly still 
in love with Tracy, but hides his feel
ings behind witty one-liners and aristo
cratic demeanor.
Another lovely performance comes 
from Terace Yeatts as Tracys younger 
sister, Dinah. She is utterly charming in 
her awkward attempts to be more grown 
up and in her adolescent obnoxiousness.
The production is visually impressive 
in all aspects: The costumes by Martha 
Pearanda are beautiful but not 
distractingly so, and David Manns light
ing design is refreshingly simple. All in 
all, under Fidlers direction, the CMU 
School of Drama has put together one of 
the finest shows Kresge audiences have 
seen in the last three years.
Three artists and a robot went ex
ploring in the wide, wild universe this 
summer. While Sojourner the rover 
scuttled around Mars, dutifully tak
ing pictures of cuddly rocks and red 
dirt, sophomore art students Emily 
Merz, Sam Wheeler, and Terry Young 
explored the worlds of their personal 
interests and perceptions. The prod
uct of their journeys, the collaborative 
exhibition Mission to Mars, was on 
display this weekend in The Frame, 
CMUs student-run art gallery.
Young and Wheeler invited me to do 
some personal exploring with their in
stallations. At the rear of the gallery, a 
green curtain with golden brocaded 
flowers veiled the entrance to Youngs 
installation, entitled Imprinting.
Through a curtain into the ante
room, the drone of a distant highway 
and the rumble of trucks emanated 
from a tin wash tub hanging on the 
wall. Above, a stylized bird peered 
down from a small print on the wall. 
Behind a white veil in a darkened 
room were three more tubs filled 
with water. Projected onto the rip
pling surface of the water were vid
eos of trucks, massive icons of speed 
and machined strength transmuted 
into wavering, silent transparencies 
rolling past on some unknown high
way. In the third tub, tiny goldfish 
chirped and chattered like birds and

blissfully flitted to and fro, oblivious to 
the dump trucks barreling over them.
Leaving Youngs installation, I de
scended down the dark and narrow 
stairwell to the basement of the gallery 
to experience Wheelers installation, 
which he described as having a sexual 
theme with overtones of opposition and 
anticipation. The centerpiece of the in
stallation was a worn and naked bed.
Heaving up from a 
gigantic rent in its 
cover, a mound of 
corn kernels 
spilled onto the 
floor, a floor which 
was itself inches 
deep in more of the 
yellow seed. 
Trapped inside 
clear bulbs hung 
around the bed, 
pairs of small crick
ets chirped. Near 
the opposite wall 
sat a seatless white 
arm chair. Beneath 
the springs of the 
empty seat more 
corn poured onto 
the floor. Posted on 
either side of the 
chair like guards, 
bug zappers added 
their erratic crack
les to the rhythmi
cally suggestive 
noises emanating 
from the bed area.
In contrast to the 
stark sexual nature 
of Defense, 
Wheeler also con
tributed three 
paintings to the 
main gallery space. 
Two he describes as
iconic conglomerations that he ere-; 
ated with his parents in mind. Both! 
paintings use layers of paint, crayon,; 
varnish, and stencils on wood, with' 
color schemes augmented by splashes! 
of gold and the regular shapes of rect-i 
angles and dots. The third painting is a; 
study in blue tones with spaces defined 
by a piece of string.
Deviating from the abstractness of! 
Young and Wheelers work, Merzs con
tribution to the exhibition is a series of 
large, bright portraits emphasizingj 
light and shadow. In the center of thej 
gallery hangs Isaac II, a portrait ofj 
the artists brother. His skin glows a; 
healthy peachy rose color, and his eyes! 
seem to look upwards to some ideal! 
cloud in the blue sky. Yet he is inhu-i 
man, like an angel or a Noxema Com-j 
mercial.
The reality of Isaac II is further! 
eroded by his skewed angle on thej 
patchwork canvas, which Merz cre-j 
ated to question dimensionality, and, 
by the contrasting harshness and re-1 
ality of the other portraits: Zoe,i 
Olivia, and Isaac I. The roundness' 
and vulnerability of the wary features 
of Zoe are emphasized by the smoothi 
ness and light colors of the paint. Yet 
the visage is clouded by dark shadows; 
which obscure and flatten the face 
into the background.
The work exhibited by Youngs 
Wheeler, and Merz, in Mission to| 
Mars was awesome. I was im-j 
pressed by the way the exhibition! 
combined three visions without ob-> 
scuring or subverting any of theii| 
individual uniqueness and clarity J 
Mission to Mars gave me a de-i 
lightful taste of some of the talent iq 
the College of Fine Arts, and hope 
fully, the trio will continue to brin, 
back such great pieces from theiij 
artistic journeys.

When judging art in todays 
world, everyone has their own 
two cents to contribute. History 
shows that some cultures have 
always been more receptive to 
certain art forms than others.
Mad, Fold 
This Book! 
Author: Al Jaffee 
Company: Warner 
Treasures
Frances government promotes 
graffiti and areas are even desig
nated for artists to tag up the 
walls. Yet, a thousand miles over 
the ocean, the United States looks 
at graffiti as a symbol of gangs 
and inner city violence.
There also exists an art form, 
which every American has picked 
UP at least once or twice, that is 
Ruite an indicator of the times.
The art form I speak of is Mad 
Magazine, more specifically, the 
fold-in pages of the book. For those
of you who have never had the joy 
of viewing a fold-in page, it is a 
cartoon that, if folded in, reveals 
another related comical cartoon.
Al Jaffee, the artist behind all 
of Mad magazines fold-ins, has 
compiled a book of fold-ins and 
named it Mad, Fold This Book! 
April of 1964 {Mad #86) began 
the long era of Mad fold-ins. Mr. 
Jaffee originally picked up the 
idea after seeing Playboy 
magazines fold-out of beautiful 
women. The cartoons caught on 
with the audience, and he went 
on to produce 33 issues with foldins until 1968.
Then the printer Bill Gaines 
wanted to move into color foldins. The concept was difficult for 
Jaffee to grasp, as he was used to 
working with black and white. At 
that time, the art form only re
quired manipulation of shapes 
and sizes, but color further com
plicated the spectrum of work.
After he was offered more 
money, he naturally adapted to 
the change, and almost all the 
issues that followed contained 
the infamous Mad fold-in.
Although most of us arent ter
ribly analytical of Mad maga
zine, when you actually 
begin to look at its 
inner properties, 
you can find a good 
indication of history 
at the time. Histori
ans might even ar
gue that Mad foldins are indicative 
of the culture and 
politics at the time 
of publishing.
Jaffee pokes fun 
at topics through
out history, such as 
the Tailhook scan
dal of the early 
90s, the pro
test movement 
of the 60s, and 
the Republican 
convention of 
1964. Po
litical 
figures, 
like Richard 
Nixon and 
Barry Goldwater, 
popped up often in his 
drawings.1997 E.C. Publications
There is more to the 
art form of creating 
a fold-in than 
merely matching 
two pictures to 
form one; it is also 
a literary art form 
that tends to re
ceive less praise 
from the reader, 
but it is equally 
complicated. 
Jaffees mas
tery of taking a 
continuous 
paragraph and 
folding it to 
form another 
continuous 
comical sen
tence is also 
worth accla
mation.
The 
folds y m - 
bolic of 20th 
century history. For 
example, in a picture published 
in July of1964, the question arises 
of how to go about dealing with
the overall obsession of the coujntry with the Beatles. Al Jaffees 
solution is for the Beatles to pre
maturely lose their hair. Al
though my interpretation might 
not seem all that comical, the 
illustrations done by Jaffee gjre 
outstandingly funny. In another 
interpretation of the times, J afl 
deals with the issue of unempU 
ment, which unfortunately fac,ed 
many college graduates in the 
early 90s.
The Mad series in general ap
pears to most Americans as sim
ply a humorous magazine, but I 
look it as a modern way of teach
ing and recording history. Al
though all our PhD-holding his
tory professors will probably 
take much issue to that state
ment, the fact that people w^nt 
out to spend money for the maga
zine should say something, j
Even though it is ridden with 
useful information and history, it 
is still a great laugh.
If youre a fan of Mad magazine, 
definitely go pick.up the bookj if 
youre like me and are a bit skep
tical, borrow it before spending a 
hefty $15.95 to own it.

ings of the characters to an En
glish-speaking audience through 
their skill in singing. The cast of 
the opera is made up of under
graduate and graduate students 
from the School of Music, led by 
Kevin Hanrahan, who plays 
Nerone, and Priya Palekar and 
Zanna Fredland, who are double 
cast as Poppea. They, along with 
,the rest of the cast, sing their 
roles with strength and skill. Be

and director of choral studies at 
CMU. He is also the music di
rector/conductor of the 
Mendelssohn Choir of Pitts

phony Orchestra.
Coronation of Poppea takes place 
in Ancient Rome. In the opening 
scene the goddess Virtu argues with 
Fortuna about which one of them
parts were those of Seneca (sung has more power over mortals.
by both Sean Cooper and Daniel 
Klein) and Arnalta (sung by 
Donna Janusko).
Coronation of Poppea is directed 
by Elizabeth Bachman. She has 
directed with several opera com
panies in North America, includ
ing La Traviata (with Sherrill 
Milnes and Plcido Domingo) and 
LElisir dAmore (with Kathleen
At this point, Amor enters and 
criticizes the goddesses. An ar
gument ensues, and Amor be
comes determined to prove the 
power of love. To this end, 
Nerone, the emperor of Rome, 
and Poppea fall in love with each 
other. Poppea rejects her former 
lover, Ottone, and likewise, 
Nerone rejects his wife, Ottavia.
In love with Poppea, Nerone 
tells her that he will divorce 
his wife so they can get mar
ried. Poppea then sings of the 
joy of becoming empress. 
Arnalta, her nursemaid, 
warns her not to be too over
confident with her chances of 
becoming empress.
Now the action switches to 
_ Ottavia, who is sad about 
being abandoned by 
Nerone. Drusilla, Valetto 
and Seneca all try to com
fort Ottavia by offering her 
different advice. Next, Sen

him that he should not be 
^ led by his emotions. Nerone 
says that he will marry 
Poppea no matter what any
one thinks.
Later, Poppea, worrying that 
Seneca might stop her mar
riage, tells Nerone that Seneca 
claims he is true ruler of Rome. 
Enraged, Nerone orders 
Senecas death.
Now the audience sees Ottone 
depressed over the fact that he 
lost Poppea. Drusilla enters and 
tells him that it is what he de
serves for ignoring her love for 
him. Ottone, determined to do 
the right thing, proclaims his 
love for Drusilla.
As the opera approaches its 
climax, the audience contin
ues to see the power of Amor in 
the actions the characters are 
willing to take for love.

was staged in Alumni Concert

Black comedy at its finest...Morbid film amuses writer
By RYAN DONOVAN
TartanAssistant Diversions Editor
Sometimes, in the desert, 
people just go crazy for no good 
damn reason. This line, said by 
one of the most insignificant 
characters in Oliver Stones new 
movie U-Turn, sums up the 
mood of the film: crazy.
What: U-Turn 
\ Director: Oliver Stone 
1 Company: TriStar Pictures
The movie, starring Sean 
Penn, Jennifer Lopez, and Nick 
Nolte, along with a swarm of 
other recognizable stars, follows 
a small potatoes hustler (Penn) 
whose car breaks down in the 
middle ofthe Arizona desert and 
is forced to make his way in a 
small town while his car is fixed 
by a dim-witted mechanic 
(played wonderfully by Billy Bob 
Thorton). Once in town, he meets 
the beautiful and alluring Grace 
(Jennifer Lopez), and thats 
where all the fun begins.
U-Turn is a masterfully con
voluted movie, which leads the 
viewer through every fetid ab
scess of the human psyche. 
But the movie isnt exactly 
what youd expect from Oli ver 
Stone, director of Natural 
Born Killers. Unlike Killers, 
this movie can safely .be called 
a comedy, albeit the blackest 
comedy in existence.
The comedic aspects arent
what one would normally expect. 
The morbid and perverse become 
funny: a sex scene with the dead 
husband watching the action, a 
brutal beating, and a man being 
left to die. Through masterful tim
ing and performances, these ac
tions are pulled off as comedic.
On the down side, some of the 
delivery of the story seemed to 
want to be more serious than it 
should have been. The movie has 
a series of black punchlines, 
leading up to the iiber-cool 
kicker at the end. But there 
were times that the film tried to 
be serious and the audience just 
laughed at it. Maybe that was 
the point, just to get all of us to 
laugh at the morbid, the repul
sive, the truly depraved, and 
show us how ever-present it is 
within ourselves.
The highlights, though, are the 
performances themselves. And 
the performances are good be
cause the characters are so well
drawn. And the characters are 
so good because the script and 
plot are amazingly done. The 
result is good actors in good roles 
with a good script. You cant go 
wrong. Kudos to Nolte as the 
scummy husband, Penn as the 
wiseguy whos really a loser, 
Claire Danes as the ditzy coun
try gal, John Voigt as the blind 
Indian, and everyone else whp 
appeared on the screen for mor,b 
than ten minutes.
Besides the amazing cast df 
name stars, Oliver Stones other 
film trademark is present: th 
cinematography. The way the 
whole movie feels is solidly Oliver 
Stone. Every non-plot item here 
reveals his touch: the music, th 
editing, even the choice of cam
era filters is distinctly his, and iii 
this movie, it works great. Even if 
you dont like some of his stylistic 
techniques, youve got to admire 
the guys innovation and preci
sion in filmmaking.

tion of that first bite is high, but the 
r'taste is surprisingly bland.
Who: The Refreshments 
What: The Bottle and Fresh 
Horses
Company: Mercury Records
Not that the album is badits just so 
average. Modern rock fans will remem
ber the Refreshments from their 1996 
break-out hit Banditos, a song with 
entertaining lyrics, fresh concepts, and 
a downright catchy tune. For the most 
part, unfortunately, the new album fails 
to recapture this  the lyrics border on 
cheesy, the concepts are recycled, and 
most ofthe tunes leave the listener more 
sleepy than enthused.
The first track, Tributary Otis, is 
solid, but its just not very interesting, 
which basically sums up the whole al
bum. Preachers Daughter is the old 
clich of bad-boy-falls-for-good-girl, of
fering no new insight. Songs like Buy 
American, Una Soda, and Fonder 
and Blonder are prime examples of 
lyrics that are just silly. Your hair 
seems to get just a little bit blonder? 
Come on.
You have to give the band some credit
 they mix the typical rock chords and 
rhythms with a uniquely Southwestern 
flavor, so the album isnt completely 
rehashed.
They take this to an absurd extreme, 
however, with Horses, a song that 
sounds like it was stolen from a drunk 
ranch hand.
Still, sticking close to the formula 
isnt necessarily bad, provided its done 
with some emotion. This they accom
plish with Dolly, a song thats fun to 
listen to despite its lack of adventure. 
Birds Sing shows flashes of lyrical 
brilliance and blends the groups West
ern style well.
Broken Record is ironically the 
albums best song, standing out amongst 
the repetitiveness. Its the only one
where the listeners dont find 
themselves hoping the song will 
end soon. A funny story (No, 
Im not a quarterback/Im not a 
fireman/Still I could have any 
girl in Japan) combined with a 
great beat and melody easily 
make it the best song on the 
CD. But for unknown reasons, 
its buried deep in the 13-song 
monotony at track 12.
The rest of the songs fall 
somewhere between Broken 
Record and Una Soda as de
cent but fairly boring.
Even the stronger songs fail 
to approach the level of 
Banditos or even the theme 
music they recorded for the Fox 
show King of the Hill, so the 
album is something of a disap
pointment. Overused storylines 
and melodies ensure there is 
little thats refreshing about 
this CD. Unless you dont al
ready know what rock music 
sounds like, leave this one on 
the shelf.

Breaking the Waves
For those of you who missed The Kingdom, when it 
screened at the Harris last year, look out! Lars von 
Trier is Denmarks answer to David Lynch. Know 
this: The man started shooting a film in 1991 that 
uses a three-minute shot from a different city in 
Europe every year for 33 years. The 99-minute film 
is expected to be released in 2024.
So this movie is another oil-rig romance in north
ern Scotland. Bess loves Jan so much that she 
wishes he will come back from the rig for good. She 
ought to have been more careful what she wished 
for, as Jan comes home paralyzed with a broken 
neck. So, obviously, the two arent really getting it 
on much anymore, so Jan urges Bess to bring brawny 
guys home so he can watch.

Swingers
This movie is so money. Its written by Jon Favreau, 
who plays Mike, a New Yorker who just moved west 
to pursue a career as a bad stand-up comic after 
breaking up with his girlfriend of six friggin years. 
The guy is miserable. Luckily he hangs out with a 
bunch of drunken rabble-rousers who spend all 
their unemployed time getting womens digits. Vince 
Vaughn plays the asshole in the bar and does a 
terrific job.
Amazingly, the director was also the director of 
photography. (I know you care.) The flick is the apex 
of independent filmmaking and a brilliant lampoon 
of life in Los Angeles.

Trial and Error
Michael Richards and Jeff Daniels star in a com
edy where an actor attempts to pretend hes a 
lawyer to save his drunken friends ass. The ad 
campaign claims its the second most outrageous 
trial in history, so I guess the first would have to be 
the Scopes Monkey trial. Or the Pamela Anderson 
Lee breach-of-film-contract case.
When did Jeff Daniels agent decide that he was 
only going to get him roles in goofy-ass comedies? 
Ever since Arachnophobia, the guys been popping 
up in the most unlikely places, usually playing the 
straight guy to some whacked-out hipster doofus. 
Does anyone think hes funny? Thats what I thought.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Sean Connery, in 
his most challenging role ever. And as an added 
bonus, I give you John Boorman, director of such 
notable filmic explosions as Point Blank, Deliver
ance, and Excalibur.
In a future Metropolis-like world, humankind is of 
course divided into brutes and gentlemen. But when 
a nasty case of the flu hits the gentlemen, they lose 
all interest in polo and sex with gentlewomen and 
just lie around watchingMcHales Navy all day and 
eating Fritos by the wheelbarrow load. Thats when 
super-brute Sean Connery kicks into action (aw 
yeah), crossing the eternal vortex and ripping the 
space-time continuum with his bitching accent.

Album breaks no new ground
By ANDREW FRANCIS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The past decade has seen an 
influx of new musical styles that 
have shaped the face of modern 
rock-and-roll, from alt-rock to 
punk to metal and even rap. The 
new EP Forever Up, from altpunk band Stem, tries to com
bine each of those styles into 
about 25 minutes of music with 
limited success.
I Who: Stem j What: Forever Up 
 Company: Ignition 
I Records
For the most part, Stem seems 
to be striving for the rap-metal 
fusion that defines such popular 
acts as 311 and Rage Against the 
Machine. Perhaps the fact that 
those are two of my favorite acts 
makes Stem seem even more dis
appointing. Stems rhythm sec
tion, consisting of Edd on drums
and Bill on bass, provides a de
cent foundation for their tunes, 
but seems to lack the drive and 
the punch that would drastically 
improve the bands sound. The 
first two tracks, Pinch and 
Drop the Bomb, both feature 
solid guitar work from axeman 
Skat and some interesting hooks. 
However, they are nearly devoid 
of anything that would really 
inspire a listener.
As the six-song disc nears the 
end, the album grows even slower 
and more ponderous. The 
songwriting changes more to
wards heavy metal than alterna
tive metal, which makes the rap
ping of frontman Ocean seem that 
much more out of place.
While Pressure Fits, the 
next-to-last song on the album, 
progresses slowly and never re
ally establishes a groove, 
Ground is a heavy-metal 
style completely lacking any 
hook or riff.
In addition to the music, 
Oceans lyrics have little or no 
depth to them. They evoke stan
dard punk themes of misguided 
aggression, and Oceans 
annoying delivery takes 
all of the urgency out of 
the message. A casual 
listener might be too dis
tracted by the challenge 
of searching for a melody 
to pay any attention to 
what Ocean is saying.
Stem certainly has the 
right elements and styles 
to be successful, but the 
music simply has no 
bouncenothing that is 
really engaging and ur
gent. Fans of the Stem 
(assuming they exist) 
may argue that the reason311andRage Against 
the Machine are more 
successful is because they 
sold out to the public. 
However, it is my opinion
that Stem is largely unheard of 
simply because they dont have 
any material that can really incite 
fans to give them a listen.

Stem strives for a mix of rap and metal.
Movie surpasses stars image
) 1997 TriStar Pictures 
Brad Pitt (right) stars with Jamyang 
Wangchuk in Seven Years in Tibet.
TIBET, from page Lll
Harrer travels alone through the 
Himalayan foothills stealing food and barely 
surviving. One day, in a remote part of north
ern India, he encounters Peter once more. The 
British had recaptured all the remaining es
capees, so Peter had set out in search of 
Heinrich. Peter and Heinrich embark together 
towards Tibet.
They eventually sneak into the Forbidden 
City of Lhasa, where no foreigners are allowed. 
They are soon welcomed by the nobles of the city 
and invited to begin new lives for themselves 
after their long journey. Heinrich and Peter 
become unofficial architects and engineers for 
the Tibetans. Peter marries a Tibetan woman, 
and Harrer becomes a close friend and semi
official tutor for the then-teen-aged Dalai Lama.
This film does a wonderful job of giving view
ers insight on Tibetan culture. It captures the
beauty of Tibet and the pure simplicity of 
their culture. The film is crafted to make Us 
empathize with the Tibetans. The people, anil 
customs that are described in this movie a|e 
extraordinary, and the viewer actually be
comes caught up in Tibetan society.
Seven Years in Tibet is based on a true stow 
written by Harrer himself. The actual Heinrich 
Harrer and the Dalai Lama remain friends to 
this day. At the end of the film, viewers are 
reminded that one million Tibetans have been 
massacred by the Chinese, who also destroyed 
many monasteries.
Those with short attention spans migiit 
find it difficult to sit still for this 135-minute 
movie. The movie kept my interest through
out, and I found the plot well-crafted. I defi
nitely recommend it for those who are inter
ested in Tibetan culture, or just like to hear'a 
good story.
Actors return home
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
As I made my way towards 
my seat for the Friday night 
showing of Love Letters, I felt 
both underdressed and under
age. I scanned the crowd of 
people my parents age for a 
familiar face and finally found 
some: the ushers.
After being so distracted, I 
only casually glanced at the props 
on McConomys stage: a rug, two 
wooden desks, and chairs in front 
of a black curtain. As the lights 
dimmed and only a soft blue re
mained, I found myself asking, 
How much acting can you do 
behind a desk?
As Jill Eikenberry and husband 
Michael Tucker (A 66) would 
demonstrate: plenty.
Eikenberry, as Melissa 
Gardner, and Tucker, as Andrew 
Makepeace Ladd III (Im not 
making this up) engage in a life
long relationship that starts in 
second grade.
After an awkward apology writ
ten to Melissas mother, Andys 
first letter, the pair quickly de
velops a fondness for each other. 
The play lets the audience dis
cover their young age, with a 
comic flair thats alive from be
ginning to end.
Will you be my Valentine? 
writes a young Andy.
Are you the one who wrote me 
the letter that said Will you be 
my Valentine?  Melissa writes 
back. If so, then I will, unless I 
have to kiss you.
These first exchanges left me 
happy and stunned. Of the two, 
Eikenberry especially came 
across child-like, instead of 
merely childish.
Now well have to write let
ters, which I hate, says the ar
tistic Melissa, who encloses pic
tures with her letters, including 
those of a bedpan, her cat, and 
Andys dog Porgie. She prefers 
the telephone, meeting in per
son, and therapy. All this letter 
writing has messed us up. Its a 
bad habit.
The play progresses through 
history and their lives.
Rather than let the letters tell
the whole story and appear con
trived, the play lets the audience 
read the characters. In a rela
tionship that spans over 40 years, 
even Andy and Melissa have 
their secrets. They periodically 
stop writing, and more than one 
letter starts, Did you get my 
last letter?
Eikenberrys face turns tremen
dously dead-pan and melts into 
anger while Tucker reads his 
mass-mailing of a yuppie Christ
mas greeting. The performances 
were terrific to watch in the close 
quarters of McConomy, where the 
actors were just a few feet away 
from the front row.
It was wonderful, Liz Bolton, 
one of the younger faces in the 
audience, said of the performance.
As the more loquacious of the 
two, Andy writes a lot. But, oddly, 
its Melissa who has more to say, 
as Tucker plays the straight man 
to her jokes.
I should have known youd 
join the navy; now, once again, 
you can be with all boys, Mel
issa tells him.
Later, when Andy runs for Con
gress, she asks, Are you getting 
stuffy and all self-important?
Ive decided to write laws, which 
are, after all, the letters civiliza
tion writes to itself, Andy replies.
Yes, you are getting stuffy, 
Melissa concludes. To his credit, 
Tucker played up his wifes per
formance, never over-perform
ing his role as Andy. In the end, 
Tuckers Ladd never quite grows 
up; he still talks in much the 
same voice as a youth as when 
hes a senator. Melissa seems to 
grow old and cynical early, but 
maintains an emotional depen
dence on Andy.
For the plays finish, 
Eikenberry is called upon to 
add a level of personal fear 
and embarrassment to the 
story, and succeeds powerfully.
The audience agreed, giving the 
performers a standing ovation be
fore the lights came on, which 
spoiled any hopes for a curtain 
call. Peter Frisch, head of the 
Drama department, described the 
performance as having a depth 
of feeling that transcends the 
roles in the play.
History, versatility 
define acting skill
THE CRITICAL EYE
by Alex Lewin
The story goes like this.
Dustin Hoffman starved him
self for three days so that he 
could better portray Babe, the 
protagonist of Marathon Man, 
who is captured and tortured 
by an escapedNazi named Szell 
(Laurence Olivier). Szell is a 
dentist and tortures patients 
with his tools. After days in 
captivity and more than one 
torture session, Babe is beyond 
exhaustion. Hoffman hoped 
that fasting would produce a 
comparable fatigue. But while 
shooting one of the torture 
scenes, he was having trouble 
remembering his lines, and 
they had to cut many times 
and start again. At one point 
between takes, Olivier looked 
down at Hoffman and said, My 
dear boy, why dont you try 
acting. Its so much easier.
Like most Hollywood folk
lore, this tale could be false 
just as easily as it could be 
true. And, like most Hollywood 
folklore, it doesnt really mat
ter if its true or not  the 
storys the thing.
But the anecdote raises in
teresting questions about act
ing. To what extent should an 
actor share the feelings of his 
character in order to make his 
portrayal realistic?
What constitutes good act
ing? Well, we know it when we 
see it. How do we know it? We 
believe the actor he or she is 
genuine. Thats what Hoffman 
was going for, after all. And 
Hoffmans performance in 
Marathon Man is perfectly 
good. He creates a believable 
and sympathetic character, and 
we dont see him at work.
On the other hand, we can 
look at a performance that ev
eryone pretty much agrees is 
terrible: Keanu Reevess in 
Bram Stokers Dracula. (Or 
Keanu Reeves in anything, ex
cept maybe Parenthood.) His 
portrayal of Jonathan Harker 
is stiff, expressionless, unin
teresting. We never know what 
hes feeling or why he does what 
he does. Do we really believe 
hed be dumb enough to spend a 
week in a big, empty, gloomy 
castle with an old, emotionally 
unstable, big-haired Romanian 
count who casts no reflection 
and sleeps all day? Reeves is 
simply not genuine.
But what about somebody 
like Bruce Willis? Hes been 
playing the same role since Die 
Hard: the tough, everyday guy 
with a quick wit, but who oth
erwise keeps to himself. He 
plays the role well, which is 
presumably why he keeps play
ing it. But does that make him 
a good actor?
A difficult question. Certainly 
Bruce Willis is good at what he 
does, but so was, say, Laurence 
Olivier. And Olivier, who could 
play anything from Nazi den
tists to lonely billionaires, did a 
lot more than Bruce Willis does. 
So much more, in fact, that the 
comparison seems quite ridiculous. History remembers 
Laurence Olivier. Will anyone 
remember Bruce Willis in 50 
years? Probably not. If Keanu 
Reeves is remembered, it might 
be as the worst actor of his 
generation. Dustin Hoffman, on 
the other hand....
Perhaps thats how we rec
ognize good acting  in a per
formance we remember. Or a 
performer we remember. But 
good actors and good perfor
mances often tend to slip 
through the cracks. Gary 
Oldman in JFK. John 
Goodman in Barton Fink. 
Michelle Pfeiffer in The Rus
sia House. Lets remember 
these, for the actors sake.
