Time-Sharing
Started Here
On Friday afternoon. April 24, 
at approximately 4:20 p.m. in the 
Computation Center on the third 
floor of Scaife Hall, Carnegie Tech 
became a remote user for the ex
perimental time-sharing system 
TSS on the AN/FSQ-32V Com
puter located in Santa Monica, 
California.
Time-sharing is a fairly new 
concept in the computer world. It 
means roughly that when a com
puter is in the time-sharing mode, 
as many as twenty-five users may 
operate the computer simultan
eously from remote teletype sta
tions in parallel fashion.
Since TSS is still in the experi
mental stage, it is only operating 
about six hours per day. How
ever, this figure is expected to 
rise steadily,. until the computer 
is put on time-sharing on almost 
a twenty-four hour basis. The 
number of simultaneous users is 
also expected to increase in the 
next lew years to about 250.
Mr. Clark Weissman of SDC, 
while on his way back from the 
Spring Joint Computer Confer
ence, demonstrated the time-shar
ing system to several graduate 
students in order to familiarize 
them with the system. It will be 
used primarily to further work 
currently being conducted, here at 
Carnegie Tech in the area of ar
tificialintelligence, particularly in 
language analysis and chess, 
playing.
Draft Age Drop 
Poses Threat 
To Students
The draft age has dropped from 
23 years to nearly 21 years m a 
period of six months. The Selec
tive Service Systems has no idea 
where the draft age will level 
off.
Men planning to return to col
lege next tail at Carnegie Tech 
or any other institution are ad
vised to write their local board 
in the early part of June.
. Their letters should include 
these important points in the fol
lowing order:
1. Students name and Selective 
Service System number,
2. Students academic class and 
major.
3. A request for continued de
ferment for study during the 
next academic year.
.4. A statement that the stu
dents university will certify 
full-time enrollment shortly 
after the opening of the next 
academic year.
During registration at CIT next 
fall, men should be sure to supply 
accurate and complete informa
tion on the reverse side of the 
Dean of Students Card. Then 
proper certification can be forewarded to the students local 
board.

graduate school. At the close o 
the talk, he was warmly applaud
ed by the members.
The new Congress policy, aa 
outlined by Sandulli, calls for in
ternal communications, closer 
work among Committee 
heads and among the members of 
Congress, and more concentration 
on Committee work.
A commitlee member shall'be
long to only two committees 
rather than three as in past yearsj

more intensely and have more re
sponsibility toward fewer commit
tees. Committees shall also be 
limited in size.
Externally, Chairman Sandulli 
called for closer ties with the ad
ministration, and cited the fact 
that two vice-presidents of Car
negie Tech had come to speak to 
open meetings of Congress in the 
past two weeks, and two had 
been seen actually enjoying them

ROTC Fights 
Mock Combat
Last Saturday, 18 ROTC cadets 
from Carnegie Tech participated 
in combat field problems with 
Marine Reserve units from the 
Pittsburgh area.
The Tech detachment, made up 
chiefly of members of the Persh
ing Rifles, served as the Ag
gressor force and proved to be 
a very efficient enemy.
Under the command of cadels 
Blocker, Davis, Pevenstein, and 
Reeder, the Carnegie Tech con
tingent proved themselves equal 
to all situations in which they 
were placed.
The maneuvers were the sec
ond in a series of two, and lasted 
from 12:30 p.m. to 12:00 midnight. 
Actual combat conditions were 
simulated with the aid of blank 
ammunition, smoke grenades, and 
other explosive devices.
The Tech Cadets greatly appre
ciated the opportunity to partici
pate in the maneuvers, for they 
provided excellent experience for 
ROTC Summer Camp.

Tartan Policy
It shall be the policy of this newspaper to print any 
view on any subject by any person, only if that person 
shows a definite regard, consideration, and respect for the 
intelligence of our audience. For although this paper has 
stated that it will speak for the students, it must in all fairliess to its power as a college and an American newspaper, 
reserve the right to discriminate among articles with regard 
to their usefulness to the reading public.
Contrary to what many believe as freedom of the 
press, we, like many other judicious publications, do not 
print everything because we feel that not everything is 
worth printing.
- - Anything which flagrantly disregards the rules of logic, 
common sense, and above all, fact, is by its own right, biased 
and incorrect.
We challenge those with radical views to advance a 
logical statement based on truth, not false assumption, 
slander, or contrived hypothesis. Any statement for publica
tion must be accurate, for beyond all considerations this 
paper is a publication oftruth.
Conjecture is not truth. Personal opinion is not public 
opinion.
Anything of this sort, the staff of the Tartan will strive 
to remove from the. pages of this paper, for we must pre
serve and promQte'what integrity this newspaper represents 
to the free press.
Editorial policy on this paper is determined by the entire 
staff, not the soie opinion of the Editor-In-Chief.
. Jeffrey Axelrads column, A Candle, in the Darkness, was 
discontinued last week because it Was felt, that, although all 
students have a definite right to speak out against what they 
consider wrong, they do not hive the right to base their 
arguments on contrived facts or false accusations.
It had been stated that Axelrad signed a two-year con
tract for the writing of his column.
No such contract was ever made.

Editor, The Tartan:
May I offer my heartiest con
gratulations on your, eminently 
sensible and intelligent editor

leaving Tech this year, I wish 
io thank you for treating me to 
three Axelrad-less issues be
fore I go as I was tired, of seeing 
his drivel clutter the pages of *he 
Tartan. If he . has a right W a 
coltimn, so do conservatives and 
liberals, both of which consti
tute rnuch larger blocks of opin

Thanks for the support, Phil.

This Week in Pittsburgh?
Letters To The Editor
Seven letters to the editor were  received at our office 
this week, five of which referred . to Thomas Rodds stand 
against the draft, one in support of Tartan discontinuing 
Jeffrey Axelrads political column, A Candle in the Dark
ness, and one against the administrations recent move to 
prevent a repeat spring fever riot. All have been printed 
in this issue.
Although we welcome views on any subject, space does 
not permit us to print unusually long letters. Therefore, it 
shall be our choice in the future to print only those letters 
which conform to the following recommendations: 250 word 
limit, typewritten double-spaced on standard unlined paper, 
or legibly written on every other line of lined paper with 
the same word limit.
All letters of irrelevant content will be rejected, arid 
those which seem repetitious may be quoted in part. No 
letter will be edited or re-worded, and none-will be returned. 
All letters must be signed, and the author may request that 
his name be withheld.

Student Questions 
Public Freedoms
Editor, The Tartan:
I thought of college as a safe 
haven where views could be ex
pressed and .actions would be 
corrimitted w i t h .o u t. incurring 
punishment for fear of bad pub
licity, and yet this is the rea
son given for not allowing 
groups of over five students to 
assemble. (The school definition 
of a mob is five people.)
The school fails to'realize that 
future .publicity will stem from 
students, and.that our ranks will 
make upthe alumni in years to 
come.
1 Two things that stand out in 
my mind are having to gel bulle
tins approved, (for they, might 
1 bring Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology derogatory publicity) and 
not being allowed to associate 
with over five people on this 
campus.
Perhaps, the course of action 
this school is  taking -is more 
detrimental in the long run than 
preventing freedom of speech 
- ajid . assembly. 'So. in the years, 
to come, for G-ds sake if not 
for your own, look and act in
telligent at all times. (Remem
ber our reputation is at stake!)
Mike Malako/T
It might be wise to re-evaluate 
your stand and decide for what 
you need this unusual freedom.' 
Think, too, that the situation  
two-sided, not one-sided, as you 
and so many others believe. See

Wrong On Rights
Last Thursday, the administration successfully prevented a 
planned riot on the campus of Carnegie Tech, Mr. Malakoff dis
agrees toith the methods the school used in doing so. ^
The administration here was not set on preventing any stu
dent opinion or gathering. There are ways to express opinion  
letters to the administration, letters to the newspaper, persona! 
interview. There' are proper places to meet and discuss impor
tant matters  Sltibo, c/assroo-ms, auditoriums.
If we think back to what mob gathering did at the. Univer
sity of Mississippi last year. (2 dead), we realize then that once 
people begin to gather in mobs, there is no way .to accurately pre
dict what wilt happen.
Under proper authorities with permission, free thought and action are encouraged. *
.Further, whew ones actions or thoughts affect the. group to 
which, an individual has pledged his allegiance, whether infended or not, then the group has the right to check -his actions.
Freedom is not disregard for established orders. Rights aren't 
claimed by a .single person without concern for any one of the 
other 3.5 billion people on this earth.
When a person starts to feel a loss of freedom when he is re
minded of his social responsibilities, then those who do'respect law 
st set him .straight as to his true rights and responEd.

Pacifists Stand Draws Replies
Teacher Demands 
Apology To Rodd
Editor, The Tartan:
Even if only a few of us at 
CIT agree with Tom Rodd, he 
has rendered an invaluable, ser
vice in arousing us lo the mod
est debate now'being carried on 
in scattered cases of this cam
pus. Only infrequently do we 
at this institution fervently dis
cuss important issues of our day. 
Last week in this column we 
rend several expressions of opin
ion on the matter, and I hope 
that they will be. followed by 
others. Mr. Fritzs letter was es
pecially thoughful, but it is most 
regrettable that students Jansson and Krall felt moved to 
stoop to name-calling, com
pounding their offense by couch
ing it in verse.
Their doggerel is deplorable 
and inexcusable. The university 
community by definition is open 
to frank consideration Of all 
points of view  indeed it must 
encourage variety of opinion 
and, its m<embers should not be 
so intellectually restricted that 
ihey; resort to ridiculing ideas 
novel to them.
Obviously these two self as
sured j'oung men have not de
veloped to the stage where they 
can participate in the exchange 
involved in free .inquiry; What 
they wrote is not only juvenile, 
it. jeers at and insults a. person 
who was a giiest at Tech and 
who is supported in his view
point by members of this insti
tution.
Jansson and Krall have In
dulged themselves in bad taste 
and have violated the basic tenet 
of free expression in the univer
sity. They owe both Mr. Rodd 
and this academic community a 
forthright apology.
Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr 
English
Self-Preservation 
Considered Basic
Editor, The Tartan:
I imagine there will be many 
letters written in response lo Mr.
Rodds explanation of his con
victions. Since the issue is a 
public one, I feel free to write 
at least one other view of what 
he acr considering. .
It is well known human's o;>t 
to live and .in this -process kill 
many organisms. Further onc?s 
body fights a constant battle 
against foreign life forms. A 
simple fact is that one must 
kill in order lo Jive. The more 
foreign, the life form, though, 
the less, the repugnance at this 
deed. Thus it is generally con
ceded that these lower life forms 
should be excluded from argu
ments and that the matter of 
killing is strictly,  human affair. 
But note, in any case, that the 
notion of taking life is more 
fundamental than just wars.
Now, a case to consider is 
what to do when attacked by 
a man gone berserk. If non-vio
lence were a'universal principle 
then one .would not ever be jus
tified in killing the man in a 
case of personal .assault. But 
many people would say in this

Self-Preserva don 
Considered Basic
(continued jrom page 4) 
case that self-preservation is as 
important a principle as non
violence. Yet, Mr. Rodd might 
permit an exception . h ere be
cause one does not often meet 
men gone berserk.
This issue, however, points 
out that while love' is. an ideal 
(Mr. Rodd draws little distinc
tion between love and non-vio
lence so I wont either) so is 
self-preservation. Individual sit
uations demand tailored an
swers. Thus while Mr. Ghandi 
may win India from Britain by 
non-violence, the. 13 colonies had 
to light a revolutionary war. It 
is in this manner-imagining a 
nation as a'persoii-that an argu
ment for a protective branch to 
guard the national personality, 
against attack by berserk nations 
is justified. To restate and il
lustrate the point, non-violence 
makes little sens When it can 
have a result of ths . national 
populace being shuffled ' off to 
crematoriums.
And finally I would like to 
make one personal point; Tor
ture is a strong word -ia load
ed word. Torture implies to me 
as I am sure it does to others 
Nazi terrors and middle age 
persecutions. If Mr, Rodd had 
bamboo splints driven, under his 
nails or was put against wet 
plaster walls while current was 
run through it then'he'was in
deed tortured. It seems more 
probable that he' was roughed 
up, maybe even beaten; but not 
tortured.
Cl.Tyler Burt
Past Letter to Rodd 
Misdirects Attach
Editor, The Tartan:
The letters concerning Thomas 
Rodds position in last weeks 
Tartan left me in some dismay, 
because they were not directed 
toward his basic arguments. .The 
letters, argued against the politi
cal position of pacifism and 
against Rodds illegal actions; < 
however Thomas Rodds position 
is based on neither political 
theory nor legal' facts. It is based 
on moral beliefs.' :
These beliefs appear to be3.) It is wrong to kill other 
human beings.
2.) It is wrong to require that 
men learn to kill.
3.) A man must base his con
duct on the law c?f God 
and on his conscience.
The. positions of pacifism, uni
lateral disarmament; and civil 
disobedience follow necessarily 
from these moral convictions. 
No effective attack on these po-. 
sitions can be made until it has 
been shown that it is not wrong 
to kill and -that;-the laws ofsor 
ciety. are superior to those of 
God and human conscience.
It was said concerning the 
present draft laws that while 
they are in. effect, it is the duty 
of every citizen in our demo
cratic society to uphold , them. 
Thoreau has indicated that if 
mans, conscience tells him a law. 
is wrong, it is his duty to op
pose that law. and if necessary, 
to break it. Such civil disobedi
ence will usually lead to punish
ment from the government, and 
Rodd has accepted that.
Mr. Rodd is hardly just cov
ering up those yellowstreaks. 
It hardly seems reasonable that 
any person would offer himself 
for up to five years, of imprison
ment out of cowardice." I 
would suggest that it takes more 
courage to act from conscience 
than to blindly follow the law 
when those two are at odds.
Thomas Rodd has .specifically 
refused to allow anyone to hire 
a lawyer to run Toms show. 
Because there .are ho legal is
sues at stake (Rodd has ad
mitted his guilt under the law), 
he has felt the presence of le
gal defense unnecessary and in
deed a hindrance to his witness. 
Legally he is a criminal' and 
must go to prison. The ques
tion is entirely one of moral 
judgment.
The writers who encourage 
history instructors to study his
tory might look at it themselves. 
5,000 years of recorded history 
show hundreds of armies main
tained because they were nec
essaryto avoid war. None pre
vented war, each helped, con
tribute to. the fear and bitter
ness that led to the next w 
Pacifist non-violent resistance 
may not be the best alternative 
to militarism, but at least. it is 
an .alternative to an historical 
dead-end road.
t Many British would give more 
credit to Ghandi than have last 
weeks, belittler. Non-violent re
sistance has been shown quite 
effective also in the American 
South. The most recent example 
would be. in Princess Anne, 
Maryland. Several students there 
have had to leave Maryland 
State  College to recover from 
police-dog bites which they re
ceived in passive protest of eglegation in the town. They had 
the courage not to act in hate 
or fear. Now these men have 
won the right to eat in the res
taurants near campus, a right 
they -were denied where the 
bulwark of freedom In .this world 
' .is the,, military strength of the 
United States .of America.
If we are to seek only nega
tive evidence on pacifist non
violence, let us at least consider 
the negative evidenceon mili
tarism. If anyone wishes to at
tack Thomas Rodd's position, 
then I would ask that he direct 
his arguments toward the -moral 
position upon which Rodd bases 
his action.
David M. Adams
Writer Replies To 
Rodds Challengers
Editor, The Tartan:
Both of the intelligent attacks 
on Mr. Thomas Rodds views 
published in the May 6th issue 
of the Tartan contained the same 
two arguments against pacifism: 
first, men of more experience do 
not. advocate it, and second, 
pacifism shows no historical evi
dence of working.
Neither of these^ arguments is 
a significant rebuttal of pacifism. 
The first argument supposes that 
men f more experience are in
herently more perceptive than 
their contmporaries. The lives 
of such people as Socrates, Co
pernicus, Darwin, F. L. Wright, 
and Walt Whitman, however, 
seriously question this suppo
sition.
The second argument employs 
history to demonstrate the fu-r 
tility of pacifism. If history 
demonstrates the futility of pac
ifism, however,, it also demon'- 
strates th futility of war, es
pecially in the last fifty years. 
The first World War was to end 
all wars; instead it Created .a 
fertile bed for the Second World 
War in an oppressed Germany. 
Then* even as the Second World 
War ended the German and,Jap
anese threats', it stimulated the 
. Russian domination of Eastern 
Europe and aided the rise of 
Mao Tse - tung in China, thus 
initiating a cold war which has 
resulted in Korea, the .Middle 
East, Cuba, Laos,, and South 
Vietnam. Clearly,- both were and 
unsteady peace are, historically, 
equally as useless in the'estab
lishment of peace as pacifism is 
claimed to be.
Despite its history, pacifism 
may still be the valid solution 
to world peace. Mr. Fritz cites 
four circumstances which con
tributed t Mahatma Ghandis 
victory over the English. He implys that in the absence of these 
circumstances, Ghandis victory 
may not have occurred. Indeed, 
it may not have, but would any 
historian c 1 a i'm that Ghandi 
could not possibly have won, or 
that the Indians would never
have achieved peacefully their 
indepndnce. This point is hot 
made to stimulate discussion on 
Indian independence, but to em
phasize. the impossibility * of se
lecting a single set of circum
stances as the essential cause of 
a historical event, as Rodds 
challengers do by implying that 
pacifists have been defeated sole
ly because they were pacifists. 
Thus, the second argument ap
pears equally as questionable as 
the first.
The other objections to paci
fism assert that unsteady peace, 
enforced by military strength, or 
total surrender are the only pos
sible alternatives to war. Un
fortunately unsteady peace is no 
alternative at all. For unsteady 
peace, assuming it doesnt de
generate into war, gives central 
government the opportunity to 
interfere in business labor dis
putes, to direct educational en
terprises, and; to-restrict the free
dom of individuals u n d e r the 
guise of 'national security. Such' 
interference results in less lib
erty for the individual, and con
ditions him to accept even great
er. government intervention in 
his daily activities; a more sub
tle dictatorship than the one he 
is fighting results. Thu, the su
perficial success of unsteady 
peace is negated by its deeper 
failure.
The prcceeding arguments im
ply that just as^acifism .appears 
to be a practical failure, so does 
war and unsteady peace.-The 
question of which form of -ac
tion should be employed cannot, 
therefore, be decided by appeal 
to the physical world; it must 
be answered by philosophy. Phil
osophy, however, yields no abso
lute solution; thus individuals 
must make, the decision for 
themselves. Mr. Rod,d has. de
cided that pacifism is the only 
solution and that the draft vio
lates his freedom to live as he 
feels' he must. Moreover, he is 
willing to test the validity of his 
belief in the courts .and to ac
cept the consequences of'his ac
tions if the courts do not concur 
with his argument. In doing so, 
he is accepting the responsibility 
of the citizen in a democracy, 
not violating them; he is exer
cising his right to object,' not 
abusing it.

Jack Missimer
Student Defends 
Tom Rodds Stand
Editor, The Tartan:
The sides need to be evened 
up .a bit. Two weeks^ ago this 
paper printed , one of the finest 
. statements I have ever read  
the one . by Thomas Whitney 
Rodd-. Last week three .-letters 
disagreed with him. ily compli
ments to both Mr. Rodd and his 
written opposition for taking the 
tinte and effort to compose mean
ingful and worthwhile argu
ments. Although I must say that 
the two authors of last week's 
ppem should be reminded of the 
fallacy of name-calling, I sym
pathize with Mr. Rodd, though I 
have never met him.
The stands taken by the let
ters of last week are well sup
ported. It is hard for anyone 
to dispute that history has, in 
general, proved the futility of 
pacifism and the necessity for 
armaments. Yet there are nu
merous, well-known, pat ar
guments for pacifism: that it's 
morally and religiously -wrong 
to wage war and/or kill, that 
arguments shou Id be settled 
peacefully, that the theory of 
nuclear force as a deterent is 
ridiculous and cannot be truly 
al-judgmenl and rather theorctical-oriented. For those who 
believe in them, as myself, they 
carry great weight'. But I grant 
that they are not very convinc
ing to the opposition who points 
to past history. For the more 
practical side of pacifism, and for
whether .in fact disarmament 
. either unilateral or .multilateral, 
can actually work economically, 
politically, and socially,-! refer 
readers to last year's Sntudaij 
Revieio serial on "World Without 
War.
But as I said, most of the 
above arguments are the pat 
expected ones. The crucial is
sue, as I see it, is whether re
ligion is a meaningful influence 
today, or ah outgrown euphe
mism. If it is meaningful, then 
lets net it; leis live religiously. 
If it's not, lets throw it away 
I pray we don't come to do the 
latter.
With the letters attacking Mr. 
Rodd last week was one, writ
ten by a minister, discussing the 
deletion of under God from the 
Pledge. It is ironic, almost sadly 
coincidental, that this letter con
tained the sentences, But to me 
religion is a matter for home and 
church or synagogue  or' io1.' 
discussions as part of the. schoo 
curriculum  and for individual 
living. But religion neither needs 
nor benefits from government in
volvement. But is the reverse 
true? That is, does government 
neither need nor benefit from 
religion? My feelings commit me 
to say that religion, to be force
ful, useful, and meaningful,, must 
pervade all of our existence. A 
that includesgovernmentgovernmental foreign policy and 
governmental domesticpolicy.
Now if we are going to al
low religion to permeate all_.our 
lives, what does it mean? r,*sthat we cannot .preach one be
lief and act another. We cannot 
say that war is bad, and yet 
prepare for it. Second, that we 
are guided by principles of love, 
not determent or retaliation. 
Third and most important, that 
we are not alone; that God is 
with us. On this third point lies 
the crux ol our issue. It is my 
belief that the reason most 
Americans do not have a mean
ingful, active religion is because 
they lack the necessary faith 
demanded by this thud point 
Only when we have faith, and 
believe that God is a present, 
able active, and loving force 
a force that can affect the course 
of history  only then, will
religion be truly worthwhile and 
meaningful, and not the blase 
thing it is now. Only Ihen can i 
we follow the Bibles teachings 
without hesitation; only the can 
we live with honor; only the, 
can we love in peaceful brother
hood with earnestness; only the* 
can we disarm without fear, do 
away with the draft without] 
misgivings. When religion is 
again meaningful for all of us 
will we have the courage to be 
I -criminal like Jesus, George 
Fox, Martin Luther King, or one 
Tom Rodd.
one can see that I believe 
pacifism, eriminar aets such j.s 
refusing to register for the d.aft, 
and even unilateral disarma
ment can be condoned But my 
main issue is not aimed at any 
one of these, but at the whole 
of our lives, ad specifically ieligion has not been based on 
cold facts and irrefutable logic. 
Rather, it comes from a personal 
experience M the power of re
ligious love, and the resultant 
commitment. 1 do not wish to 
modify my position by saying. 
-You cant really argue with me, 
since you dont really iJhow 
forceful religion can be. On the 
contrary, please do argue. Th. k 
I am a crazy idealist if you will, 
but also consider the part re
ligion is now playing in Ameri
ca, and the part it will play. De
cide whether we are going 
make it work for us ami w*t" 
us, or whether its time to foiet the whole idea.
 For my part, I would feel 
safer if we were disarmed now, 
,vcn with Russia bristling with 
arms. For we would not be alone. 
Lets take a stand for what God 
really is! .Thomas W. Clements

Hauge Talks 
To Be Sold 
By Tech Press
A volume of three lectures 
given last fall at Carnegie Tech 
by Gabriel Hauge. president of 
Manufacturers . Hanover Trust 
Company, New York, will be pub
lished by The Carnegie Press 
under the title Is the Individual 
Obsolete?
Dr. Hague made three separate 
talks for the 1963 Benjamin Fairless Memorial Lecture series on 
the overall theme The Individual 
m the Modern Economic World. 
The volume, the first in an an
nual series, was off the presses 
April 30.
Each year an outstanding au* 
thority on subjects related to 
business administration, econom
ics, management and labor, hu
man liberty and individual enter
prise. will be invited to lecture at 
Carnegie Tech under the Fairless Memorial Fund.
The guest lecturer will give 
three separate talks and when 
possible will spend some time on 
the campus to meet with students 
and faculty members.
Mr. Fairless, in whose honor 
the lectures were established, was 
a friend of Carnegie Tech and 
served on its board of trustees 
for 10 years. He was named hon
orary chairman of the board in 
1959 and was a leader and cochairman of Techs ten-year $32,- 
225,000 development program 
from its beginning in 1957. Mr. 
Fairless was chairman of the 
board of United. States Steel.
Alumni Appointed As 
Admissions Authorities
A relatively new student recruiting program here at 
Tech got underway in late 1962. Aiming directly at estab
lishing Carnegie Tech as a logical and desirable choice for 
the nations most talented and creative students, it involves 
alumni more and more actively in its search for the best.
.A-------------------------------------------------- Those alumni who;ive their 
time and efforts to this program 
are appointed by President War
ner and are members of the Car
negie Admissions Council, (CAC) 
which, was instituted in 1963. 
Now located in seven cities, 
Akron, Cleveland, Chicago, Phila
delphia, Rochester, St. Louis, and 
Washington, D.C., the Council has 
a membership of 130 alumni, 
serving a total of 154 schools. 
Each has a Chairman, Alumni Ad
visors, and Special Area Advisors. 
The Area Chairman is responsible 
for CAC in his area, coordinating 
and directing its operation and 
supervising the activities of the 
Advisors. The Alumni Advisors, 
assigned to one of two specific 
secondary, schools, interview ap
plicants, serve as continuing con
tacts with prospective and ad
mitted students as well as upperclass C.I.T. students from their 
schools, and act as liason between 
the schools and C.I.T. Special 
Area Advisors, not assigned to 
particular schools are on call 
when their services are needed.
The program, which envisions 
nation-wide coverage within the. 
next several years, is not en
deavoring to increase the number 
of applicants for admission, but 
rather to interest more and more 
of the most able high school stu
dents to matriculate at Carnegie 
Tech. Competition for the best 
among the nations many fine col
leges and universities has become 
exceedingly keen. Carnegie Tech 
wishes still to search out firstrate students. About 600 schools 
were visited by members of the 
Admissions Office.

Carnegie Thindads Lose to Westminster; 
Post 6-2 Season Record Under New Coach
The Track Team ended their season on a sour note last 
Saturday, going down tQ defeat against a strong Westminster 
team 82-58. The Tartans thus completed the season with a 
6-2 record in dual meets and a second in one triangular meet. 
A large portion of the credit for the good season must go to
first year coach Ed Vamos, who*--------------------1------:-----------------------------*
will be back next year to try for
Standout performer for the Titans 
was Armstrong, who placed first 
in both hurdles and the triple 
jump, setting a track record of 
41.6 in the 330 intermediate 
Hurdles. Westminster had another 
double winner, Bailey, who won 
the 100 and the 220.
Running in his last track meet 
fpr Carnegie Tech, Andy Niedra 
was Techs only double winner, 
taking first in the 440 and the 880, 
finishing the season undefeated in 
the 440. Andy ended a 12 letter 
varsity career at Tech the same 
way he started, finishing first. His 
first try was in cross-country 
freshman year. Yesterday he com
peted in an individual quarter 
mile at Shaler High School, and 
he plans to continue competition 
in the regional AAU meets.
This was also the last meet for 
senior Joe Thomas, who set a 
school record of 41.8 in the 330 
intermediate hurdles, Gus Kalogeras, Tom Bednarz, Ben Long, 
and Jim Hamilton.
Other strong performances 
made for Tech were Chris MacKosko, running an outstanding 
mile; Roger Cairns in the two 
mile, Bob Diskin in. the broad 
jump; and Tony Williams in the 
pole vault. With the holdovers 
for next year, and freshmen like
