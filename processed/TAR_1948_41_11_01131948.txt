rapidly changing world, named four main points to be considered 
at the conference. '
The topics involve methods of 
training the professional man to 
deal with specific problems in his 
own field, conditioning him to see 
his problems in relation to their 
social, legal and other implica
tions, the making of the profes
sional man as a citizen, and pre
paring him for professional or so
cial change.
Prof. Smith has announced the 
selection of the chairman of each 
of the three sessions of the con
ference. These leaders, in educa
tion are Donald K. David, dean 
of the Harvard Graduate School 
of Business Administration; Kar]
T. Compton, president, Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology; 
and Arthur T. Vanderbilt, dean 
of the Law School, New York 
University, and former president 
of the American Bar Association.
Dr. B. Richard Teare, head, de
partment of Electrical Englneerin, Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology, will be the engineering 
representative on the speakers 
platform during the second ses
sion of the congress which, un 
der the Chairmanship of Pres
ident Compton of M. I. T., will be 
devoted to Content and Methods 
of Instruction in Professional Sub
jects.

Will Be On Sale At Registration
The first issue of Form, the arts school magazine, will be sold^-
at registration for the spring semester. This announcement was 
made after a meeting of the new staff last Thursday.
The feature story of the long-awaited first issue will be about 
the Beaux Arts ball, which is to be held the Friday after Form 
appears. Other articles include some reviews of New York plays, 
the story behind the Take It Easel Club, and a history of the 
Beaux Arts Balls. ?-------------------------------------------------
Form will first appear as a 24 
page issue, with advertising kept 
at a minimum. Last Saturday the 
staff gathered in Fine Arts to lay 
out the first copy of the magazine.
Several stories from previous 
staffs are being incorporated into 
the new Form.
Interest has been growing con
tinually since we got under way 
two weeks ago, stated Jack 
Hackler, editor of the magazine.
Not only have new members 
shown enthusiasm, but good sup
port is being received from those 
associated with the old staffs.
In commenting on the use of 
the Beaux Arts theme for the is
sue of the long delayed arts mag
azine, Hackler noted that he hop
ed that this issue would become a tradition.
He noted however, that there 
are still a numbsr of positions
open on the staff and that work
ers in all fields of publications 
skills and interests are needed.
Meetings are held in Room 107, 
Fine Arts, every Wednesday and 
all Arts students have been invited to attend.
The final plans for the produc
tion of Form were completed with 
unexpected swiftness. Two previ
ous attempts to establish an Arts 
School having failed, considerable 
difficulty was expected in the 
third try. The problems were 
solved quickly, however, and 
preparations were made with the 
co-operation of members of for

Protesting the Student

into every open position after 
an unexpectedly light ballot

results set aside on the basis 
of a supposed Council Consti

Led by Robert Crago, Electri

direct violation of the Student 
Council Constitution, specifying 
Article 4, section 2, which states: 
The Student Council shall pub
lish in the Tartan a complete list 
of the offices to be filled at least 
one week before candidates peti

Student observers of the cam

violation claim would be upheld, 
and that a completely new elec

Editorial
Protest Unjustified
Protesting the recent Student Council 
election on the ground that not enough time 
elapsed between the announcement of the 
event and the balloting, a group of Indepen
dents are attempting to have the results set 
aside.
We believe this action to be unwarranted 
by the facts.
The fraternity ticket was elected to 
Council, with its low man receiving twice the 
points recorded for the highest Independent 
candidate, when fully three quarters of the 
small number of people who voted appear to 
have been fraternity men.
Denouncing fraternity rule and extolling 
the virtues of the defeated candidates make 
impressive talk, but we fail to see the logic 
involved when so few of the overwhelming 
number of potential independent voters on 
campus bothered to spend the five minutes re
quired to cast a ballot.
This campus, like any democratic unit, does 
not belong to the inert majority. Democracy 
and full representation are not birthrights but 
privileges which require re-earning at fre
quent intervals.
The issue at stake here is comparatively 
trivial. The technicality involved is just that, 
and the campus has simply passed by a rather 
astonishing majority into the hands of those 
who are interested in its future.
Perhaps the student electorate will remem
ber this incident at the spring election (a new 
election now is hardly justified or even fair), 
and will remember it once again wThen they 
become responsible citizens.
For elections such as this are one of the 
reasons that there are so few functioning democracries in the world todayand are one of 
the reasons why our national future is now 
uncomfortably obscure.
Improvement Note
To descend briefly to more mundane topics, 
the mens rooms in Industries, Engineering, 
and presumably Machinery hall would be much 
improved by the inclusion of wooden racks for 
coats and books. Washing Pittsburgh from 
ones person seems to be a rather futile thing if 
the city is to be smeared back on by articles 
of clothing and equipment which have been 
laid on floors and atop dusty marble partitions 
for want of safer parking space.

Can She Prance up a Hill?
Can She Dance a Quadrille?
It is difficult to give it sufficient thought, rum
inated the pundit, what with the ear-splitting 
racket from that brassy chorine, and the impolitely 
merryman at the next table. Blast it, does he have 
to laugh so loud? Something to calm the nerves, he 
thought. If I dont get something quick Ill have 
a dome-ache and lose my stoic calm. Drat it, Garcon. Ah, here comes the waiter with the drinks. 
Half an hour Ive waited, mumbled the great man. 
Not even the Marshall plan can improve a Paris 
liquor joint, he sighed.
But now again to the significanceprancing up 
a hill . . . Ah, here comes my disciples, Francine, 
Fifi, and Francois, all leaders of international 
thought in their chosen field, which is Significance. 
But they must come to me, to me the chimney 
sweeps son, to learn about existentionalist signi
ficance. How gratifying! Oh, my ego, how dare you 
dissipate my stoic calm! Well, since the ego ex
ists, doesnt extentionalism demand that it be 
used? Perhaps.
At the other tables the American reporters and 
literati, vacationing well-to-do people and their 
wives, lean forward in eagerness to absorb every 
movement of the learned savant who can discern 
the meaning of life looking through the stem of a 
cocktail glass. Now look! The profound philosopher 
fingers a maraschino with the long fingers of an 
artist turned intellectual disciplinarian. He dis
courses . . .
Again, my followers, I ask what is the signi
ficance, for that is a question we must all ask or

such folk songs are the unconscious voice of the 
soul? Divine its significance and you have found 
the souls own song.
The vulgar man at the next table roared like a 
sick dog. No doubt he means it again for a laugh. 
M students, he disturbs me, that braying one. 
Make a sign to the proprietor. Whereupon the 
waiter came with the drinks.
Now, said the exalted 9ne, prancing up a 
hill, that is symbolic. For when we prance up a 
hill we overpower our troubles, our trivial prob
lems we prance over. That is just it. To existenti
ate we must prance. But a quadrille cant be 
pranced, only a hill. Notice how the simple peas
ant mind subconsciously perceives this cosmic 
existism and puts it in verse. A quadrille can be 
danced, but only after a hill is pranced. Over.

students.

Right Face!
By Robert Charpie
Thank God the Communists are out of Holly
wood and the movies are pure!!
But is kicking the Communists out of Holly
wood going to be enough? It seems to me that there 
have been other influences, just as damaging to the 
nation, at work there for years.
It is high time the movie industry grew up. Pic
tures are no longer, as they once were, pure en
tertainment. Their influence on the thinking of the 
American people is not small. Therefore they should 
provide a more realistic and wholesome outlook 
on life than they now do.
I object to the personal conduct of the inhabi
tants of the movie colony. Their merry whirl of 
marriages, divorces, fights, and court cases is suit
able pap for some newspapers to print, but it in
dicates a group of ill-adjusted individuals.
There are many very fine artists in Hollywood 
who have been able to live normal home lives 
despite their place in the public eye. Some stars, 
though, change husbands and wives almost as often 
as they change hats. Certainly such an example is 
a dangerous one to set for the public at large.
We are too apt to rationalize the insane antics 
of the movie colony as being necessary accompani
ments of artistic temperaments. It seems more 
reasonable to me to charge it off to emotional un-j 
balance. Whichever way we choose to explain such! 
behavior, the United States is not benefited when 
the rest of the world thinks that the American! 
people are typified by our movie stars.
In striving for what they call realism the movie
makers have succeeded in releasing an unbeliev
able number of sordid pictures. The plots concern

Letter to the Editor
Election System Criticized
January 7, 1948 
Editor, the Tartan:
Congratulations to the fraternity 
election system for the most suc
cessful coup in its history. For the 
first time Carnegie Tech has an 
all-fraternity Student Council.
We can attribute the success of 
the bloc in this election, as in the 
past, to the system of controlled 
voting which it has developed. 
Under this system, each fraternity 
man is given a preferential list to 
vote from.
These lists are made up and 
distributed in such a way that 
each machine-backed candidate 
gets an approximately equal num
ber of votes. In this way no votes 
are wasted on some candidate who 
may be very popular and might 
otherwise get more than enough 
votes to be elected. The effective
ness of the system has been dem
onstrated in the election just held.
But there is one thing which 
has not been clearly demonstrated. 
Does the fraternity election sys
tem give any consideration to the 
best interests of the school?
It is difficult to justify the list 
of candidates supported by the 
Fraternity Election Committee on 
such a basis unless one is willing 
to admit that because a man be
longs to a fraternity he will make 
a better Council member than a 
man who does not belong to a 
fraternity. It is not necessary to 
belabor this statement with dis
cussion; it is just not true.
Within fraternities and without 
there are men who will make good 
Council members. When, there
fore, the Fraternity Election Com
mittee supports only fraternity 
candidates, it must set the inter
ests of a fraternity above those of 
good student government.
Fortunately, the fraternities, in 
their own private primaries be
fore the recent all-school elec
tions, chose some very good can
didates for Student Council. The 
independents need have no fear 
that Council will become a par
tisan group to aid the fraternities 
at the expense of the other stu
dents on campus. The new Councilmen have far more sense and 
vision than was used in setting up 
the system which elected them. 
They are, on the whole, a capable 
group, and well-suited to carry on 
the affairs of the school.
It is in the best interests of 
every student on campus that can
didates be elected Re their own 
personal merit.
The fraternities as well as 
the independents must determine 
that in future elections men will 
be supported on the basis of merit 
so that some of the unfortunate 
features of this election will not, 
be repeated.

Leaman Dies

Killed In Accident
Stop All Key Awards 
Pending Checkup99
Jack Seward Hits Too Liberal 
Policy, Asks Full Council Study
By F. R. Johnson
Suggesting that Student Council stop all distribution of keys 
by campus organizations pending the results of an investigation, 
Councilman Seward keynoted the first meeting in 1948 of that or
ganization at the Carnegie Union, Wednesday afternoon, January 7.
Another highpoint of the meeting was the announcement that 
the student council election held just before the Christmas recess 
had been protested and that it was possible that the election might 
be declared illegal. Other subjects on the agenda included the Stu
dent Council banquet at the Carousel January 16 and the investi
gation of food prices and quality on campus.
A lengthy discussion of the key situation was initiated by a 
report from Miss Knee of the*
Points and Keys Committee. She 
opened her report with a motion 
that keys be awarded to the mem
bers of Delta Skull. This motion 
was approved and a statement of 
the key policy of Cano followed.
A motion that the Cano key 
policy be approved started an at
tack on campus key distribution 
in general and on Cano in par
ticular. Jack Seward, asking for 
a study of key distribution on 
campus stated that the present 
key policy is too liberal. Ques
tioned by Councilman Ewart,
Would you like to see all distri
bution ' of keys on campus 
stopped?, Seward answered with 
a curt Yes after a seconds 
pause.
Budget chairman Naylor at
tacked Canos key policy indi
rectly by repeatedly asking Coun
cilman Gustavson, editor of Cano, 
that the magazine submit a budget 
to council. After saying that all 
the financial transactions have 
been highly irregular, Naylor 
moved that the approval of Ca
nos key policy be postponed in
definitely. Following the defeat of 
this motion, Council decided that 
the matter would be postponed 
one week.
Mr. Shapiro announced the re
sults of the December student 
council election and moved that 
Council approve the election.
President Marshall recommended 
that the matter be tabled pend
ing the settlement of a protest 
that had been registered at the 
office of the Dean. Commenting 
that the charge had been made 
that Council was illegal in its 
method of conducting the elec
tions, Marshall said Actually it 
doesnt amount to anything.
Councilman Shapiro led an op
position of seven against the Stu
dent Council banquet to be held 
at the Carousel, suggesting that 
the $250 budget might better be 
spent to aid worthy campus or
ganizations. His motion that the 
banquet which already had re
ceived Councils approval be post
poned was overwhelmly defeated.

devoted to new business Jerome

Chester W. Leaman
Chester W. Leaman, a teaching 
assistant in mathematics, was kill
ed early New Years day when his 
automobile crashed into a service 
pole on Second avenue in Hazel
wood. Mr. Leaman, who was 26 
years old, was married and had 
one son.
He received his B. S. degree in 
physics and mathematics upon 
his graduation from Hamline 
university, St. Paul, Minnesota, in 
1943. Before he was inducted in
to the Army in 1944, he taught 
mathematics at Hamline and physics at CIT.
After his discharge from the 
service in 1946, he became a 
teaching assistant in the physics 
department. He had received his 
M. S. degree in mathematics in 
June of 1947. In October of the 
same year he took the position of 
part time instructor in mathe
matics. When the regular school 
session opened last year, he was 
appointed to the position which 
he held when he died.

I further cannot see where we 
have a democratic Student Coun
cil. As it stands now, no man has 
a chance to be elected unless 
backed by fraternities.
Perhaps if Council had seen 
fit to send representatives to the 
NSA conference at Penn State on 
December 20 which dealt with 
democratic student governments, 
it would have found out that NSA 
does have plans whereby truly 
representative governments may 
be set up on every campus. 
When the Tartan interviewed 
Student Council president George 
Marshall, whose vigorous attack 
in Council on NSA was largely 
responsible for the vote which re
jected CIT affiliation with the or
ganization, it found his views on 
the subject to be even stronger 
than before.
I dont think that NSA is what 
Carnegie Tech needs, he stated. 
The National Student Associa
tion is a union of students, which 
seems pointless for a college man 
who spends four years in school.
Since our enrollment is large
ly composed of engineers who are 
potential managers, there could 
be little interest in an organiza
tion which borders on unionism. 
For this reason, I do not feel that 
Student Council would have the 
unanimous approval of the stu
dents for putting us in NSA.

Last night marked the beginning of a week of hilarious en
tertainment and boisterous comedy that will continue through Jan
uary 20 in the Little Theatre. The gala occasion was the opening 
of the drama departments presentation The Great Magician, writ
ten and directed by Lawrence Carra of the drama faculty. The 
play will have a matinee performance on Friday.
The purpose of the play is to*------------------------------------------------
attempt to recreate for the con
temporary audience the gaiety 
and spirit that once enthralled the 
spectators of the 16th century.
Each troupe consisted of famil
iar tumblers, lovers, comic and 
serious actorsstock characters 
easily recognized by their weird 
masks and costumes. They trav
elled from town to town perform
ing on open stages in the streets, 
public squares, courtyards, and
indoor theatres. To recreate this 
effect no setting is being used in 
the current production except for 
a curtain background.
The comedy types in The Great 
Magician have been created in 
terms of popular modern day 
comedians. For instance, the doc
tor, played by Bill Leech and Bob 
Reynolls, is a W. C. Fields type; 
Pantalone, played by Bert Pol
lock and Mary Kolatch represents
an old Jewish merchant type of 
comedy.
Pulcinella, played by Wes Ken
ny and Joe Beruh is a stooge. The 
blustery and bravado Capitano, 
played by Lee Vogel and Eddie 
Edmonds, is really a weakling 
with big talk. The Brooklyn type 
is played by Bob Challener and 
Bill Clark. Zanni is an acrobatic 
clown and imitator played by 
George Corvin and A1 Lehman. 
The weird and mysterious magi
cian is played by Joe Schlafman 
and Bill Putch.
Others in the cast include Emily 
Barnes, Sada Thompson, Ken Garlinger, Bob Casey, Collette Craw
ford, Gaye Jordan, Jim Lang, 
Marty Gal, Louie Knaak, Joe 
Dove, and Ken Welch.
At the suggestion of the Stu
dent Conference Committee, the 
Cashiers Office will now cash 
checks of up to $25.
The original request was made 
to President Robert E. Doherty at 
the last Student Conference committee meeting by George Bickerstaff, president of Interfraternity 
council. It was viewed favorably 
and was passed on to Mr. H. R. 
Patton, comptroller of CIT, who 
agreed to raise the check cashing 
limit to the amount asked. The 
new ruling was put into effect on 
January 5, thus providing a $10 
increase over the sum previously 
obtainable at one time.
Rendering services such as this 
is one of the primary purposes of 
the Conference committee. The 
group was established by the 
President as a means through 
which the student body could have 
direct contact with him to make 
the service more effective.

Clark Sloan, Jim McMichael, 
and Mike Bodnar were elected respectively morning, afternoon, 
and evening program managers. 
Robert Coddington was elected 
business manager and Harold 
Lipchik advertising manager. 
Other new members of the executive board are Gail Bank, chief 
announcer; Pat Williams, publicity manager; Otto Abraham, chief 
operating engineer; Dave Royce, 
chief construction engineer; and 
Sema Moskovitz, chief secretary.
College radio stations at Bucknell university, Ohio university, 
and Mt. Olivit college as well as 
Carnegie Tech were represented 
at the regional conference which 
was to allow the representatives 
from each campus to seek and 
give information which wc lid be 
of use in the operation of their 
individual stations.
Abramsons criticism, however, 
introduced an entirely new note 
into the discussions. Stating that 
the present rates set by the network precluded the building of 
any volume of advertising, he 
suggested lowering the rates and 
thus increasing the total revenue. 
He further suggested that upon 
building up a larger volume, de
pendent upon the lower rates, the 
system would be able to set up a college-to-college network by 
means of long distance telephone 
lines. Thus the original purpose 
of the IBS could be fulfilled. 
Representatives from the other 
three schools present at the con
ference expressed themselves as 
being in accord with Abramsons 
views.
Lucky Seniors 
Attend Class 
Next Summer
Because of the large number of 
requests, the departments of elec
trical and mechanical engineering 
are planning to offer second se
mester senior courses during the 
summer of 1948 with commence
ment exercises scheduled for 
September 19.
The summer semester will ac
commodate 126 students, divided 
into three sections of electrical, 
two of mechanical, and one of 
aeronautical engineering.
The following subjects will be 
offered: for electricals  E-410, 
E-416, E-422; for mechanicals 
E-452, E-516, E-518, E-520; and 
for aeronauticalsE-452 E-524,
E-520, E-534. Seminar will be 
omitted and all requirement^ 
waived. ROTC will be handled 
by special arrangement, for which 
those involved should consult Cap
tain Dogan during pre-registra
tion for the spring semester, 1948.
In addition to the subjects list
ed above, some of the social rela
tions senior electives will also be 
taught. A survey will be taken to 
determine which of these courses are in the greatest demand.
Registration for the summer 
semester will be June 21 with 
classes from June 22 to September
18. Final exams will be taken at 
the last meeting of each class.

St. Justins Graduate Takes Over 
Guard Berth On Carnegie Varsity
When Bill Donohoe looked for some talent as the nucleus of 
this years edition of the Tartan cagers, he found two regulars 
and several reserves on hand from last years squad. Among those 
reserves was John Riehl, who has since worked his way to a 
starting guard position.
St. Justins high school served as Jacks scholastic training 
ground before his entry into CIT in the summer of 1945. While at
St. Justins, Jack labored for two 
years at a varsity guard berth.

Council Election
[Continued, from Page 1]
Kane were elected from Margaret 
Morrison.
A breakdown of the voting in
dicated that most of the ballots 
were cast in the Engineering Col
lege, where 35 percent voted. Only 
22 percent of the electorate ap
peared at the polls in Fine Arts, 
and Margaret Morrison trailed the 
school with but 19 percent.
Fraternity resistance to the 
proposed voiding of the election 
results is being based on this 
analysis of the voting, claiming 
that its small size was caused 
largely by ft general lack of Inde
pendent interest.
This point of view is being 
sharply attacked by Cragos group 
which holds the Election Commit
tee failure to comply with the 
Council Constitution to be the 
chief source of the low vote and 
the overwhelming fraternity vic
tory.
The extent of this success was 
indicated when it was revealed 
that the lowest fraternity man re
ceived 3282 points under the new 
preferential balloting system, and 
that the leading Independent re
ceived but 1773 points.
Also included in the protesting 
statements of the Independents is 
a claim that the new balloting 
system was inadequately explain
ed before the election, and that 
this failure played directly into 
the hands of the fraternities.
Fraternity leaders have denied 
the validity of this objection by 
pointing out that the Tartan has 
fully reported each Council meet
ing, including within these re
ports the details of the progress 
and changing nature of the new 
measure as it passed through the 
legislative mill.
Jack Seward, one of the frater
nity leaders, summed up his point 
of view on the entire affair by 
stating bluntly: The whole thing 
should stand just as it is.
He will be sharply disputed by 
the Independent opposition, how
ever, which expects that the De
cember 18 election will be voided 
and hopes to give the fraternities 
a hearty fight at the next trip to 
the polls. ,

Although the squad was not of 
championship calibre, it gained a 
lot of satisfaction by finishing in 
the number two spot in local Cath
olic B league competition.
Last season was Jacks first 
fling at college basketball, and as 
a result he was used sparingly, 
usually only in the closing min
utes of the games. While the op
position was rolling over the Tar
tans, Jacks playing improved to 
such an extent that he soon began 
bounding over the hardwood long 
before the final whistle blew.
In spite of his lack of experi
ence Jack was able to win a var
sity C and was able to play enough 
ball to emerge as the seasons 
most improved player. His best 
basketball attributes are speed 
and ball handling, but when the 
opposition has Theodore and 
Katselas tied up, Jack can do his 
share of scoring.
During the 1946 soccer season 
Jack held down one of the out
side left positions on Pat Con
ners varsity aggregation. He also 
has been active in intramural 
sports, performing with the Sig
ma Nus. In the summer months 
Jack plays sandlot basketball with 
the Warrington recreation team in 
Mt. Washington.
Jack is now a typically confused 
junior in the Electrical depart
ment, intent primarily on play

All CIT Students 
Are Eligible For 
Gunnery Awards
The National Rifle Association 
has announced a new series of 
awards for college students mak
ing qualifying scores in either rifle 
or pistol firing. The awards are 
available not only to varsity 
teams, but also to any other stu
dents who wish to enter the com
petition.
M/Sgt Reed, rifle instructor of 
the Carnegie ROTC has announc
ed that anyone wishing to fire may 
do so Monday through Friday from 
9:30 to 10:30 a. m. All equipment, 
including rifles, loading blocks, 
shot spotting scopes, shooting 
jackets, shooting gloves, targets, 
and mats will be available to those 
interested, but because there is no 
appropriate fund students must 
supply their own ammunition.
The new awards will be on the 
order of keys; after the firer has 
qualified he must pay a fee of one 
dollars and have his score certified 
by Sgt. Reed. As many targets 
may be fired as desired and the 
fee need not be paid until after 
the qualifying score has been at
tained.

In Rough Game, 46-40
Pitt Five Solves Carnegie Defense 
After Trailing In Second Period
In a rough and tumble battle at Pitt stadium on January 7, 
the University of Pittsburgh Panthers clawed out a 46-40 victory 
over Carnegies basketball quintet. It was the first game of the 
annual home-and-home series between the two schools which be
gan back in 1907.
The first quarter found Pitt unable to crack through CITs de
fense as they were limited to one field goal. Although the Tartans
found it equally hard to get near^-------------------------------------------------
the basket, they were successful 
enough with far out shots to get 
a lead of 9-5 at quarter time.
Pittsburgh changed their tac
tics in the second quarter as their 
hefty forwards shoved their way 
in under the bucket. The inabil
ity of the Skibos to clear the ball 
out of their defending zone proved 
costly as Doc Carlsons men took 
shot after shot from close-in.
Midway in the period Pitt .took a 
lead which they never relin
quished. 
The third period was almost a 
duplication of the second as the 
Panthers maintained a bruising 
tempo which Bill Donohoes 
charges found hard to beat. Spec
tators were treated to a rough 
game which included such plays 
as Sammy Davids flying tackle 
of Bob McCullough and the three f
man wedge put on Jack Riehl.
Pitt and Carnegie fans both claim
ed robbery, but few fouls were 
called during the course of the 
evening. >
The shooting consistency of 
Cecconi, Canterna and David 
eliminated any hope Carnegie had 
as they widened the Pitt lead to 
six points in the fourth quarter.
In the closing minutes, with Dave 
Ellies and Len Bianchi in the 
Plaid attack, the Tartans fought 
hard and managed to narrow the 
gap to six points before the final 
whistle. ,

Despite a new starting line-up, 
Carnegies hard-luck cagers went 
down to their fifth straight defeat 
on January 10, bowing to Wash
ington and Jefferson 57-35 on the 
Washington high school courts.
After scoring the first point of 
the game, the Tartans were un
able to keep pace with the Jays 
who were more accustomed to the 
fan-shaped backboards. Several 
of the Plaid floormen tightened 
up completely which resulted in 
the amazingly poor shooting aver
age of only 11 successes out of 68 
tries from the floor. They also 
missed 23 of the 36 free throws 
awarded them. The Presidents on 
the other hand, converted 19 of 
28 charity tosses. Ten of these 
came in succession in the second 
half.
The game from a spectators 
standpoint was strictly between 
referees Gallo and Hickes who 
were prone to blowing whistles. 
In a period of three minutes at 
the start of the second half, the 
sound of a whistle pierced the air 
an even dozen times.Trying to eliminate the mistakes 
which cost them a victory over 
Pitt, the Tartans were confront
ed with an entirely different style 
of play as they attempted to break 
into the side of the basket. Their 
most efficient type of shot in pre
vious gamesa one-handed push 
from about fifteen feet outwas 
either over-shooting or falling 
short of its mark.
The Presidents found the basket 
difficult to locate in the first fif
teen minutes but after that they began sinking shots from all po
sitions. Don Campbell and Tom 
Osso evenly divided 22 points for 
the winners. Mike Theodore took 
individual scoring honors with 16 
points.After the Prexies built up a big 
lead at the start of the second 
half, the Skibos began playing 
desperate ball. This enabled W&J 
to draw steadily to their game 
winning margin.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1948THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Creguts Sports Scope
Basketball League Standings 
To Determine School Champion
This week will see the start oi 
the second major intramural 
sport of the school year when 
basketball teams representing 
nearly every organization on cam
pus swing into the competition 
that will determine this years 
school cham
pion. And with 
the oncoming 
hoop season 
there will arise 
again the most 
ubiquitous prob
lem that faces 
the intramural 
departmentthat 
of officiating.
In many in
stances in the 
past few years,
_ . _ , the caliber of thePete Cregut offlclatillg in both
football and basketball has been 
so poor as to nearly destroy the 
spirit of friendly rivalry which 
should prevail. Anyone who 
watched the football games last 
fall knows what poor officiating 
can do, and officiating is even 
more important in basketball than 
in football. Laxity on the part 
of the officials causes the game to 
get rough and out of hand while, 
at the other extreme, calling the 
plays too closely can slow the 
contest unreasonably.
This year Mr. See, who has tak
en over the supervision of the in
tramural program in a very com
petent manner, is going to try to 
do something to overcome the de
ficiency. The first step will be the 
use of two men to handle each 
game. This is a very important 
advancement as it is nearly im
possible for one man to cover the 
whole game by himself. While 
only one man has been used in 
the past, the result is usually that 
he can call the plays properly on 
the side of the floor which he is 
on, but has to rely on a good deal of guess work on plays on the 
other side. Two men should elim
inate this guess work to a large 
extent.
The second step will be to in
crease the amount paid the of
ficials with the object of making 
it worthwhile for a man to work 
the games. The pay has been ten
tatively set at $1 per man per 
game with the assurance that 
each man will have the opportun
ity to work two games in an even
ing. Considering that the games 
usually take less than an hour 
apiece, it is a good Way to make 
a little extra money during the 
next months.
The third step is an attempt to 
improve the embryo official tech
nical knowledge of the game. Mr. 
See has engaged A. L. Walsh, one 
of the best collegiate officials in 
the district, to come here to hold 
a clinic for the men who have 
signed up to referee the games 
and to go over the theory and the 
interpretations of the rules and to 
answer any questions that may 
arise. The meeting will be Mon
day night, January 10, at 7 o?clock 
in the gym. All those interested in 
refereeing the games, regardless of 
whether they are playing the 
league or not, are urged to sign in 
the intramural office. Officiating 
schedules will be arranged for 
those who intend to play, to avoid 
conflict with their games.
We think that this program 
which has been outlined here is 
just the kind of thing that is 
needed to remove the black mark 
on the intramural program. Our 
congratulations go to Mr. See for 
the work that he has done to make 
this possible.

Betas, Theta Xi Keep 
Lead In Both Leagues
The holidays didnt affect the 
Citcom bowlers very much. They 
came away with all honors last 
Saturday when intramural bowl
ing competition resumed.
Citcom leads all departments in 
their league, the Strikes, except in 
standings. They are tied for sec
ond with Delta Upsilon, having 8 
wins and a single defeat. Beta 
Theta Pi, idle this week, retains 
their lead with an unblemished 
record of 6 and 0.
Citcom blanked Delta Tau Delta 
No. 2 three games to none as they 
turned in the high team game of 
the season at 892. This elevated 
the team average to 804.2 pins 
per game.
Defarrari helped his team and 
himself with a series of 213, 189, 
202, His 213 was second high for 
the day and ties Weinreichs lead 
of high individual game in the 
Strike league. Defarraris aver
age of 187.5 is tops for both 
leagues, however, leading 
Schwendner of Sigma Nu No. 1 
who has a 178.8 average.
The DUs dropped one game to 
Combine but remain in a tie for 
second. Brents 185 in the second 
was high for the winners but 
strangely enough it was the sec
ond game that Dorm Combine 
won. Similarly, Myers 181 and 
Cunhas 181 in the third for the 
Combine wasnt enough.
Sigma Nu No. 1 fell to fourth 
place as they took two of three 
from Kappa Sigma. Schwendner 
had a series of 159, 206, 205 for 
the winners.
In the other Strike match, the 
Phi Kaps took the first two but 
dropped the last to ATO. Tricaricos 211 in the first was top 
score for the Phi Kappas as Lar
sen and Schier of ATO had 189 
each in the second and third re 
spectively.
Theta Xi remained undefeated 
in the Spare league with 9 wins 
and no losses. They bowled over 
Sigma Nu No. 2 despite Roths 
high game of 215, which takes in
dividual honors in both leagues 
thus far this season.
Delta Tau Delta No. 1 placed 
second in league standings when 
they beat SAE 2 to 1. Beals 201 
in the first helped SAE win that 
game.
While the keglers were holding 
the center of the sports scene, the 
volley ball swatters brought their 
season to an emphatic close. Emanon gave the TXs a struggle in 
the first playoff game before bow
ing out 21-18. This win gave the 
TXs plenty of inspiration and 
they trounced their opponents 
21-13 and 21-5 to sweep the 
match.
The SAE squad, representing 
the Tartan league, received a gift 
as the Emanons failed to floor a 
team in the second leg of the 
playoffs and a forfeit was declar
ed. This eliminated the no name 
spelled backwards team and 
threw the battle to the SAEs and 
TXs.
The final series of games proved 
to be no contest. The TXs took

Plaid Swimmers Lose 
To Kent State, 35-31
After losing to a powerful Slippery Rock aggregation in a pre
vacation duel, the Carnegie Tech swimmers were edged out in a 
meet with a surprisingly scrappy Kent State squad at the Ohioans 
pool last Saturday by a score of 35 to 31.
The meet was a battle all the way as the lead changed hands 
four times. The final event proved to be the meets clincher. It was 
then that Kents team pulled ahead by defeating the Tartan four
some of Luckey, Coathe, Zukas-4 
ky, and Sapper.
The Skibo mermen were out
numbered in firsts, taking only 
three winning places compared to 
their opponents five. Carnegies 
unbeaten medley team of Schroeder, Luckey, and tapper came 
through in fine fashion to start the 
meet off.
Later in the 150 yard back
stroke, Molny produced Carne
gies second win with Schroeder 
swimming to second place after 
overcoming his opponents terri
fic lead. Dave Luckey and Bill Zoller accounted for the final 
wins by finishing one-two in the 
200 yard breaststroke, and from 
then on it was a matter of Kents 
catching up.
The battle for second place 
points was the cause of greatest 
excitement, however, and Sap

State in for a tie in the 220 had 
the spectators on their feet.
The lack of freestyle strength 
and the fact that the diving com
petition was not held made it pos
sible for the Kent State team to 
avenge last years defeat at the
the first 21-15 and then went on to stomp their adversaries 21-6 
and 22-20. This championship 
gave the TXs a tighter hold on 
the lead in the all points trophy 
race since they previously won 
the football championship.
The hottest news on the intra
mural scene is that basketball 
will begin its season Wednesday, 
January 14. Most teams have been 
practicing since the end of foot
ball season and the outlook is for 
some keen competition.
Handball and table tennis art
ists will be interested to note that 
individual and doubles tourna
ments are planned to take place 
during the coming two weeks. 
Anyone interested in competing 
should contact Mr. See at the in
tramural office.
Any grunt and groaners that 
are running around the campus 
might get in touch with Mr. Alex
ander or Mr. See. West Virginia 
University and Waynesburg have 
contacted CIT with the request 
that informal wrestling practice 
meets be arranged with the Tar
tans. A few more men are need
ed to fill out the squad before such 
action can be taken.
The cauliflower kids might 
further observe that they could 
compete in these informal meets 
and also in the intramural tour
nament that is being planned. In 
addition, Pitt is interested in 
matching their intramural champs 
with the best Carnegie Tech has 
to offer from our winners.
hands of the Tartan swimmers.
Again displaying the power for 
which they are - respected, the 
Slippery Rock speed merchants 
downed the Carnegie team in a 
home meet on December 17 by a 
score of 39 to 26. The Tartans 
were limited to three firsts: Dave 
Luckey in the breaststroke, Robin 
Molny in the backstroke and the 
medley relay outsplashed the Rockets men.
On Saturday the Skibo tankers 
will again be running up against 
tough opposition as they meet 
Oberlin at the Carnegie Tech 
pool. Oberlin sports power in all 
events this year, and if their ver
satile ace Bruce Kinsey is turned 
loose there is no telling how many 
records will fall.
The meet with Oberlin will 
probably start at 2:00 and admission is free.
Larsen Backs NSA
[Continued from page 3] 
pie that NSA borders on labor 
unionism. Perhaps it would be a 
lot better for the country if en
gineering students had a better 
understanding of the values and 
principles of unions.
Attacking the value of partici
pation in NSA from another point 
of view, Marshall alleged that 
We have too much to give and 
nothing to receive.
Larsen offered evidence to the 
contrary as he continued to ex
plain the* utility of NSA.
In order to derive benefits 
from an organization, individual 
members must contribute ideas, 
time, and abilities, he noted.
As evidence of the part which 
we could play in NSA, I have re
ceived requests from three uni
versities for copies of our Student 
Council constitution. These 
schools have decided, since their 
participation in NSA, that their 
present student governments were 
not adequately fulfilling the needs 
of their students.
Marshalls comments on CIT 
athletics reiterated the present 
arguments being used in defining 
the extent and nature of the 
schools participlation in intercol
legiate sports.
Many seem to feel that we 
could have a class A football 
team if we were not dominated 
by the administration.
But these people are just not 
acquainted with the manner in 
which technical schools are rated. 
In order to have a crack football 
team, it would be necessary to 
give the players a simple course, 
and although this is possible, it 
is not very probable, as it would 
materially reduce our present 
high scholastic reputation.

Veterans Interrupting 
Work Must Inf orm VA
Deadline For Reinstatement Of 
GI Insurance Extended To July 31
Veterans who graduate in February, who will not continue at 
Carnegie after the first semester, or who desire to interrupt train
ing between semesters should submit a request for interruption of 
training to the Veterans administration office on the campus, R. E. 
Haynes, training officer, said this week.
Definite times have been set for each of the three groups to 
report to IH 144-A. Day school GI Bill men who graduate in Feb
ruary should report January 14# 
and 16.
Veterans other than graduates 
who do not plan to return for the 
second semester should appear 
January 14 and those who desire 
to interrupt training to save en
titlement between semesters 
should report January 16. All re
quests must be submitted by Jan
uary 16.Evening school veterans who 
fall into any of these groups are 
requested to report on either Jan
uary 16 or 23 between 6 and 8 p. 
m. All evening school requests 
must be submitted by January 23.
Veterans presently enrolled for 
study who discontinue their train
ing under the GI Bill before their 
period of entitlement is used up 
must obtain a supplemental cer
tificate of eligibility before re
entering training. This certificate 
indicates the amount of additional 
training that the veteran is enti
tled to at government expense.
If the veteran has satisfactorily 
completed the previous course, 
the supplemental certificate can 
be issued almost immediately. If 
he has failed in his original pro
gram, he must receive complete 
professional counseling before a 
new certificate can be issued.
The deadline for reinstatement 
of GI insurance has been extended 
from December 31, 1947 to July 
31, 1948, the VA announced. This 
extension gives World War II 
veterans additional time to Rein
state lapsed National Service Life 
Insurance without necessarily tak
ing a physical examination.
To reinstate prior to July 31, a 
veteran usually needs only to cer
tify that his health is as good as 
it was at the date of lapse and 
pay two monthly premiums.
In answer to numerous in
quiries, the Veterans administra
tion said that there is no provi
sion in the GI Bill which permits 
VA to make loans or -advance sub
sistence payments to veterans en
rolled in educational or training 
programs.
Public Law 16 veterans may re
ceive advancements not exceed
ing $100 from a revolving fund 
which has been provided under 
the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. 
This advancement, givn to dis
abled veterans who are entering 
training, must be repaid to the 
VA in regular installments.

Buttles Resigns Post, 
Returns To Germany
Professor Bruce Buttles has resigned as head of the printing 
department after having been called by the army department to be 
director of information control in Berlin. Assistant Professor

Having been continually requested 
by the Army department since 
May he said, I am sorry that I 
can not remain as head of \he 
printing department, but in view 
of the circumstances in Germany, 
which are not ordinary, I feel that 
I can best apply myself in this post 
of public service and responsibil
ity.
He went on to say, I do not 
consider that the acceptance of 
this post will cause a severance of 
relations with this school. I feel 
that as an alumnus I shall be able 
to help almost as if I were here.
In 1946, Mr. Buttles served as a 
lieutenant colonel and Assistant 
Military Attache of the American 
Embassy in Moscow. Prior to this 
he had been assistant city edi

This dance is one of a series of 
activities being initiated by Cit
com to expand its social program. 
The most recent of these affairs 
was the Snowball, a picnic held 
last Saturday afternoon at the 
Totem Pole lodge in South Park. 
Although the picnic could not live 
up to its name, the absence of 
snow did not dull the appetites of 
the seventy revellers who attend

AIGA Chapter 
Formed At CIT
Says Who?
The first college chapter of the 
American Institute of Graphic 
Arts, a national printing organ
ization, was formed last week at 
Carnegie Tech. The CIT chapter, 
which was founded by the organ
ization formerly localized around 
New York City, preceded the for
mation of a chapter at Dartmouth 
college by just three days. Other 
college groups are already being 
organized at MIT, Syracuse uni
versity, and Yale.
To date, the group has a mem
bership of 73, which includes two 
faculty members of the printing 
department. The purpose of the 
Carnegie chapter is to raise and 
uphold the standards of graphic 
arts. It is hoped that this will be 
achieved by bringing exhibits on 
printing to the school. The pres
ent aim of the organization is to 
have the Fifty Books of the 
Year exhibit brought to Car
negie. These books were selected 
as the best in type, layout, and 
general design that have been 
printed within the past year.
Official installation of officers 
and presentation of a charter will 
be made about January 15, dur
ing National Printing Week.

Council Meeting
[Continued from Page 3]
Bell recommended that a com
mittee be set up to make a study 
of the food situation in other non
profit institutions from a stand
point of cost and quality to in
crease the quality of Skibo serv
ice. Councilman Bell said that he 
wanted to make it very clear that 
no charges are being made that 
the present prices are out of line. 
President Marshall appointed Bell 
and Johnson to a committee to 
make the study.
A $266 deficit on the Military 
Ball was reported to Council and 
an appropriation amounting to 
one-fourth of the cost of the dance 
was made to help cover the loss. 
Other matters settled included ap
proval of the constitution of the 
Debating Society, approval of all 
the action taken at a special meet
ing of Council on December 17, 
approval of a closed dance to be 
held by the Teknon Club in This
tle Hall Friday, January 16, and 
a similar affair to be held by the 
Citcom Clan the following even
ing.
During the course of the meet
ing Councilman Gustavson pre
sented the election policy of Cano 
for approval. The policy was ap
proved without any discussion.
The scheduled regular meeting 
of Council on December 17 de
teriorated into a special meeting
when sufficient number of repre
sentatives to make a quorum 
failed to appear. A discussion of 
a loan to the Kiltie Band for con
cert instruments occupied most 
of the short meeting. During the 
course of the discussion an accusation was made that a member 
of the administration had prom
ised the backing of Student Coun
cil in a letter to the Executive 
Committee before the matter of 
the loan had been brought before Council.
Councilman Schucker, asking 
for approval of the loan, said that 
the concert instruments are badly needed by the Kilties. He said 
that some of the instruments have 
already arrived on campus and 
that several more have been con
tracted for.
Councilman Shapiro moved that 
the administration be sent a let
ter asking them not to force Councils hand in a similar man
ner again. The motion was de
feated.
It was announced that the Debating Society was reorganizing 
and would participate in intercollegiate debates during the com
ing semester. A motion was made 
that their constitution be reaf
firmed but the matter was tabled 
until a regular meeting.

social committee gained approval for a closed dance to be held by

Council without the full authori

GETTYSBURG ADDRESS

One of the Girls
By Sada Thompson
-better knownA bouncing joviality identifies Ruth Gubermanas Gubey.
A tall, striking girl, she has a wonderfully mobile, expressive
face, round jolly cheeks and very sad, wise eyes. One of the drama
departments most electric personalities, she is also one of its most 
gifted actresses; an intuitive sense about people makes her hon
estly concerned with them and enables her to dig with real con* centration into the characters she 
plays.
Gubeys laugh has become her 
trade mark. Explosive, uninhib
ited, and infectious, it proclaims 
her genius for seeing the humor 
in any situation. Not only has she 
a flair for telling a story that is 
unequalled in pure hilarity, but
she is a most appreciative audi
ence for her fellow dramats. 
Everyone knows when Gubey is 
in the house by her audible and 
very heartening enjoyment. Re
sponding as enthusiastically to 
casual bon mots as to elaborate 
stories, she is a popular person on 
whom to try out a new joke rou
tine.Her voice is probably Gubeys 
biggest asset in dramatic work 
great clarity, power, and flexi
bility enabling her to play a wide 
variety of roles. Little Theater 
patrons will ^remember her work 
in The Trojan Woman two years 
ago. Last year, as a junior, her 
maturing abilities were evidenced 
especially in King Lear and 
People at Sea, while this year 
she has added to her laurels with 
work in The Wingless Victory. 
Terribly absent-minded, she has 
been known to walk out of the 
Beanery on a freezing day with
out her coat. Just watch her 
when she puts anything down. 
Ten to one she never picks it up.

character types which most of us 
have never heard of or seen. For 
example, how many psychologi
cal mysteries have been released 
during the last few months?
The greatest single fault I have 
to find with the movies is in their 
treatment of what they call 
love. A great deal of unhap
piness in real life has unquestion
ably resulted from the erotic 
love so frequently depicted on 
the screen.
Many of our divorce and child 
delinquency problems can be 
traced back to movie-like love 
at first sight and sudden mar
riage beginnings. Wouldnt a more 
wholesome, not to say more truth
ful, treatment of love and family 
life serve to give children a bet
ter chance to start life with high 
ideals?
What is the solution? Censor
ship from outside the industry is 
a poor remedy. It only gives hardshelled producers free publicity, 
and assures their cheap produc
tions commercial success  wit
ness the case of The Outlaw.
I can only conclude that the 
movie industry must make itself
responsible by more rigid regula
tion from within. The recent Con
gressional investigation of Com
munist activities in Hollywood is 
a ready-made springboard to get 
an industry-wide reform started.
Adequate reforms will be forth
coming only if the public demands 
them. Hollywood will always pro
duce what the moviegoers want, 
or seem to want. The full poten
tial benefits of the movies will 
never be realized through the con
tinued production of cheap, lusty, 
inartistic, unentertaining films. 
The public can effectively boy
cott these poor productions by 
showing taste in selecting its en
tertainment fare.
We have already put up with 
enough growing pains from the 
movie industry. Lets use the boy
cott rod nowor well risk spoil
ing the child.

10THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 13, 1948
Synchro-Cyclotron Laboratory 
Will Be Finished Next Summer
Carnegie Techs nuclear physics department has announced that 
the syncho-cyclotron laboratory is expected to be completed some
time next summer. Actual operation of the synchro-cyclotron will 
begin in about two years. The laboratory will be built away from 
the campus at a location not yet determined.
Among those from the physics department who are working on 
the project are Professors Creutz, Sutton, and Fox; Messrs. Foss, Lasday, and Rose are the principle^------------------------------------------------
graduate students who are assist
ing in the design and construc
tion.
The development of this machine 
will make Pittsburgh one of the 
most important centers in the 
country in nuclear physics be
cause of the wide range of appli
cation of the synchro-cyclotron in 
industry. It will also be of great 
benefit to Carnegie Tech because 
it will produce radio-active iso
topes for research in the chemis
try and metallurgy departments.
Appropriations for this project 
have been received by Carnegie 
Tech from the Buhl Foundation 
of Pittsburgh. In addition, the 
Westinghouse Corporation has of
fered equipment at reduced prices.
Parts of the machine are being 
designed in CITs electrical engi
neering department. There, Pro
fessor Williams and Mr. Thomas 
DeBolt, a graduate student, are 
being assisted by other graduate 
students in designing a model 
oscillator.
Following are a few significant 
figures about various parts of the 
synchro-cyclotron: it will contain 
about 1,060 tons of steel; the cop
per coil will weigh 100 tons and 
will produce a current of 10,000 
amperes; the magnetic pole pieces 
will be about 130 inches in diam
eter; the oscillator will have a 
frequency of 32 megacycles per 
second and will be frequency mod
ulated at 26 megacycles per sec
ond.
It is expected that the machine 
will produce protons of 300 million 
electron volts of energy with 
velocities of 120,000 miles per 
second.

WSSF Drive 
To Commence 
In February
The Womens Athletic Associa
tion sponsored an old-fashioned 
square dance last Friday night at 
eight oclock in Thistle hall. With 
Sy Braley calling the dances, the 
blue-jean and plaid shirt attired 
couples had a real hill-billy 
time. Thistle hall was also dressed 
for the occasion.
The World Student Service 
Fund will begin its campaign on 
campus the first week in Febru
ary. The appeal was started by 
college students in this country to help war-racked universities 
abroad. It is being handled by the 
cabinets of the CWCA, YMCA, 
and the presidents of other or
ganizations.A sound movie depicting condi
tions in those countries whose 
students need our aid was shown 
to a selected group of campus 
leaders and faculty members yes
terday. It is hoped that the film 
will be available during the first 
days of the campaign this Feb
ruary. Originally taken 'to be 
shown as a short in regular thea
ters, some of the scenes were 
judged to be too shocking for 
commercial use.
Notices will be posted at the 
start of the WSSF campaign con
cerning the second showing of 
the movie.
by Olga Sampias
The story of Alexandra, Gladys Schmitts third novel, should
be of interest to Carnegie Tech students for it was inspired by the
authors work as an English teacher in the Fine Arts College.
Pittsburgh is the background for the greater portion of the 
book, and familiar places and scenesShadyside, the bridge above 
the railroad tracks, Schenley Park and the panthers at the entrance 
are often mentioned. The novel deals with a portion of the popula
tion not often written about: the^ 
lower middle class intellectuals.
In contrast to Miss Schmitts 
earlier work, David the King, 
on which she worked for five 
years, Alexandra was finished 
in only eight months. In David, 
the author was concerned with 
mans relationship to his God; in 
Alexandra, she studies an art
ists relationship to the common, 
ordinary mortals of the world.
The theme of the novel had 
long been a haunting one for Miss 
Schmitt and so, finally, slie laid 
aside another novel, which she 
had been writing, to start work on 
Alexandra. During the latter 
part of the past summer, she 
worked as much as twelve hours 
a day.'
As soon as one begins to read 
the novel he is struck by the fact
that it is very concise. There are 
no superfluous words or actions; 
the story is trimmed to the bare 
essentials. Yet there is no lack 
of vivid imagery, no skimping in 
development of characters.
The story is told by Sophie Littman, a good, solid girl who meets 
Alexandra while they are both in 
grade school. In contrast to her, 
Alexandra is highly imaginative, 
too intense and too sensitive.
There are three parts to the 
book. The first deals with Alex
andras childhood and is based 
largely on the authors own exper
iences as a child. It ends on a high 
note, Alexandras first success 
as Rosalind in the high school 
production of As You Like It. 
At this point, her genius is be
ginning to be sensed. Sophie, the 
good, the practical, was awed by
her friends performancewon
der struck as a child who car
ried home a muddy ring and 
hears it called pure gold.
From here, the story carries 
Alexandra to the realization of 
her ambitions. Spurred onward 
by an innate fire, the rejection by men who could not bear her 
too great intensity, and the stub
born pride which would not ac
cept defeat, achieves fame. Yet 
her days of glory are overshadow
ed by the tragedy of not finding 
what she truly wants, or perhaps 
of not knowing what she truly wants.
Alexandra is a tragedy but 
it is not morbid. A fitting sequel 
to David, it is a short, relax
ing book with a smaller, more 
limited thesis. If David is the 
complex work, the symphony, 
then Alexandra may well be 
called a nocturne for the piano.

PGP Announces Plans For Membership Drive
Phi Gamma Pi has announced its plans for enlarging active 
membership this spring. The campaign is in effect immediately, and 
the group urges all who are interested and eligible to apply as 
son as possible.
Any girl who has been enrolled in evening classes at Carnegie 
Tech for the current semester and plans to enroll next semester is 
eligible to apply. Because the groups membership is limited in
number, it is important that those < 
interested apply now.
Elsie Capelli, Phi Gamma Pi 
president, has appointed Mar
guerite Wylie pledge mistress in 
charge of the spring class. Ad
dress all applications to Miss 
Wylie, Pledge Mistress, Phi Gam
ma Pi, Box 256, Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, Pittsburgh, 
13, Pa. In applying please in
clude the following details: name, 
home and business address, home 
and business phone, course in 
which presently enrolled and 
evenings on which class meets.
Phi Gamma Pi is a young or
ganization but nevertheless its 
record is interesting. The group 
was formed by girls who an
swered several articles in last 
years Plaid. Its first meeting was 
held in December, 1946, and since 
that time the group has signed 
its constitution and was recog
nized by evening student council.
Because Phi Gamma Pi is the 
only organization for women 
evening students, there is a defi
nite need for just such a group. 
Members are aware of this need 
and have worked hard to make 
the organization the fine one it is.
Miss Capelli commented in re
gard to the current drive for 
members I hope that all girls 
will consider membership in our 
group. We are looking forward 
to receiving applications and com
pleting plans for initiating our 
first pledge class.
Provost Smith
[Continued from Page 1] 
light on some basic and challeng
ing questions.
The final session, headed by 
Dean Vanderbilt of N. Y. U., will be concerned with Education of 
Professional Students for Dealing 
with Human and Social Problems, 
for Leadership of Public Opinion, 
and for Humane Living. Prof. 
Smith will address the educational 
leaders as spokesman for the en
gineering profession.
CIT Teacher 
Is A Native 
Of Pittsburgh
It may be interesting to note 
that our versatile, young, English 
Composition C-110 A, teacher, Mr. 
G. E. Schindler, is a native of 
Pittsburgh, born in Carnegie, 
Pennsylvania.
He attended the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology as a chemical 
engineering student. While study
ing at Tech, he worked in the 
mineralogy department of the Car
negie Museum.
During the war, Mr. Schindler, 
as a meteorologist in the United 
States Army Air Force, attended 
the University of Chicago. After 
his discharge from the Army, he 
turned to the University of Chi
cago where he earned a Bachelor 
of Science degree. Science is his 
hobby.
At the present time, Mr. Schindler is working for an M. A. de
gree in English at the University 
of Pittsburgh. He teaches engi
neering at Pitt, and is particularly interested in teaching Eng
lish to engineering students since 
he has a profound interest in both 
of these subjects. He says that 
his evening school students at 
Tech are eager to learn and co
operative.
Mr. Schindlers ambition and 
hard Work should provide in
spiration for the many evening 
school students at Carnegie Tech.
Council Membership 
Problems Discussed
Happy New Year everybody! I 
suppose after a two week lay
off you all were full of pep, vim, 
and vigor at the start of this 
week of school. Okay, I know 
what you are thinking Who is 
he kidding?
One of the new arrivals this 
year is a baby girl at the home of 
Mr. and Mrs. Schindler. He is an 
English composition teacher. Yes, 
the boys received cigars.
Here is a quotation by a man 
named Fairfax who is in psycho
logy class  Work is for Fools 
and Mules, hmmmm.
A man by name of Barthel in 
the same class was absent last 
week, the Instructor said, We 
missed you last time, the reply 
was I wasnt here.
Mary Coscia and Charlene 
Tohey, the doodling twosome, 
came up with a slight difference 
of opinions. Mary decided she can 
do without shoes and Charlene 
objects.
Our Ex-editor Betty Ashcraft 
sent a card wishing everybody a 
Merry Xmas from her and her 
hubby.Same to you folks!
One of the girls of PHI GAM
MA PI, name of Betty Hensler is 
reported engaged.
A plea to Miss Ethel Witzel Please return to English Com
position, the boys are getting fran
tic,with only 3 girls in one class and 
one missing. Thing of the com
petition.
At their December meeting, the members of the evening Stu
dent Couneil heard a report on evening student registration com
pared with the number of representatives on Council. It was pointed 
out that council is sadly deficient in representation from most of 
the departments. In pre-war days, this group was at times comprised 
of forty students but now it is down to seventeen members.
Half of Councils membership is from the electrical and mechani
cal engineering departments. Fine 
Arts school has only one person 
to uphold its rights. That one 
member is from painting and de
sign. There is a need for students 
from the architecture, drama, 
music and sculpture departments 
to speak for their fellows. Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie college 
as well, has only one member.
In the engineering school, 
chemical engineering has two and 
management engineering one rep
resentative. The civil and metal
lurgical departments have none.
A committee has been appoint
ed to attempt to correct this sit
uation. The group is composed of 
Elsie Capelli, MMCC; Elizabeth 
Lang, Mgt. E; Ray Schwain, M.E.; 
Will Schnarrenberger, Chem. E.; 
and John Vranic, P& O. Any stu
dent interested in helping to solve 
this problem may do so by con
tacting Louis Adams, the commit
tee chairman, at Ma. 2600 Ext. 
391 during the day or at Fe. 2966 
on Tuesday and Thursday eve
nings, or by seeing one of the 
committee. Your suggestions are 
requested.
Pool Is Open 
Wednesdays
Swimming, one of the most 
healthful athletic recreations, is 
available to evening school stu
dents every Wednesday evening 
from 7:00 to 10:00. The CIT pool 
is equipped with both high and 
low diving boards and the water 
is always kept warm for the com
fort of the swimmer. A lifeguard 
is always in attendance and will 
give instructions to those inter
ested. After the swim, hot and 
cold showers provide a tonic for 
tired muscles. Bathers must fur
nish their own suits and must 
present their registration cards in 
order to gain admittance.
If the demand is not great 
enough, this privilege will be dis
continued, so lets all set Wednes
day night aside for swimming.
COKE
Mr. Simms thinks that most 
people drink too much and his 
system is a little different. He 
juSt drinks to increase the com
edy.
John Vranic has been search
ing for a pot of gold for a long 
time and he has finally came up 
with a prize. Its a Packard.

Pittsburgh has been very lucky 
in missing the big snow storms of 
the past few weeks. Then the 
students returned to campus and 
the shoveling started.
Biggest news of the weekend 
was the IF formal  everyone 
wore shoes. And some of the

Visiting Critic 
Lecture Series 
Aids Architects
The sub-senior architectural 
classes will gain practical experi
ence from the services of a ser
ies of visiting critics, each of 
whom will take one major project 
for a month. The critics are from 
the Pittsburgh district, being ac
tively engaged in various aspects 
of professional architectural work.
The first speaker scheduled is 
John Marsbee Simonds of Simonds and Simonds, landscape arch
itects. His topics of discussion will 
be centered on the integration of 
landscape and architectural de
sign.
Mr. Mario Celli, chief architect 
for Rust Engineering company, 
will be the second critic. Mr. Cel
li will conduct the students 
through a study involving small 
industrial buildings. The purpose 
of such a plan is to give the sen
iors an insight into the various 
aspects of architectural work.
A student jury plan has been 
initiated into the department. 
From each class two students will 
be appointed to aid the instruc
tors in judging the work of their 
respective classes. They will par
ticipate in judging the problems, 
recording the jurys opinion, and 
posting this record for the benefit 
of the class. Jurists will be no
tified of their appointments 
shortly before the completion of 
each problem. Each time a differ
ent set of students shall be ap
pointed to act as jurist.
