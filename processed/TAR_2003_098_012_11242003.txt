Hazing at Kappa Sigma uncovered ECEadds
^ ^ jifJvisnr*? 1"oMembers of spring and fall pledge classes cite hazing and unfair practices as some of the reasons for leaving the fraternity en masse
by Matt Rado
Staffwriter
Eleven members of Kappa Sigmas 
spring pledge class and five out of 
ten members of the fall pledge class 
de-pledged recently amidst allega
tions of hazing. Members of the 
spring pledge class, who did not wish 
to be named, say they were forced to 
chug 24 ounces of maple syrup in 
one incident and at one point were 
forced to run through a gauntlet in 
the fraternitys hallway in which 
they had to carry a ball and were hit 
with punching bags. The hallway 
was filled with obstacles such as 
couches and trip wires. Pledges 
emerged with rug burns and three of 
them puked as a result of the inci
dents. They also said one of the 
pledges suffered a minor concussion.
Pledges were also threatened with 
other activities, such as dumpster 
diving, milk chugging, and wrestling 
in the cages by the buggy garages.
A confrontation between brothers 
and spring pledge John Boucek, 
H&SS sophomore, provided the cat
alyst for pledges leaving. Boucek was 
asked to leave by brothers after a 
meeting, at which time the other 
pledges began to question why such 
a decision was being made. 
According to the pledges, brothers of 
Kappa Sigma referred to Boucek as a 
cancer on the brotherhood and 
said he was trying to destroy their 
fraternity. Pledges say they were not 
given satisfactory answers and 
announced that they all would be 
leaving as a result. In a period of a 
few minutes, the entire Kappa Sigma 
spring pledge class had quit.
Boucek said he was forced to leave
because he would not lie for the 
brothers.
I wouldnt lie to the new fall 
pledges about what goes on in the 
house, said Boucek.
Pledges say that the brothers told 
them that the 
new pledges 
would learn 
what they know 
later on and at 
the discretion of 
the brothers.
Four days after 
members of the 
spring class de
pledged, mem
bers of the fall w.th e.ar1o 
pledge class did the same. The end 
result was that five out of ten mem
bers of that pledge class also quit. 
Members of the spring pledge class 
say they simply told the fall pledge
class about their experience.
The reason they de-pledged is 
because of what we told them had 
happened, said Boucek.
Spring pledges say their experi
ence changed distinctly after their 
first semester. A week after the class 
before them initiated, they said, the 
brothers started having midnight 
meetings. These meetings involved 
yelling and verbal abuse and were 
held in a secluded part of the house. 
The larger brothers were present and 
the fraternity members had what the 
spring pledge called a commanding 
presence.
They would never look you in the 
eyes. They knew it was all bullshit, 
said one member of the spring 
pledge class. Pledges also said that 
brothers tried to keep you up late 
and fuck with your academics and 
that some pledges were told to run
errands late at night, such as buying 
a pack of cigarettes for a brother. 
Pledges say brothers disregarded 
school and academics and that the 
pledge class grades suffered as a 
result.
Spring pledge class members also 
discussed other aspects of their expe
rience. Pledges had to carry around a 
pledge book with them and gather 
signatures and quotes from the dif
ferent brothers of the fraternity. 
Pledge books are common at frater
nities, but if a pledge lost their 
pledge book, which happened to 
some members of the spring pledge 
class twice, the brothers would hold 
an auction dinner, where sugges
tions were taken from brothers as to 
how the pledges could get them 
back. The pledges would then be

Busted
The burglars behind the theft of a $2000 bronze 
bust of Andrew Carnegie relate their tale.
by Lucas Yiannatji
Staffwriter
Two weeks ago, the University 
regained a stolen object worth 
$2000 and significant historical 
value. The bust of Andrew 
Carnegie, kept at the Hunt Library, 
was recovered after being missing 
for over a month and a half.
Gabrielle Michalek, head of 
Archives and Digital Library 
Initiatives at Hunt Library, 
explained the statues worth.
Its part of our history. These 
busts were given to Carnegie-fund
ed libraries ... but the libraries are 
getting old and disappearing from 
the landscape, and so are the busts. 
So theyre becoming more valuable 
because there are fewer of them in 
the world, she said.
The two thieves agreed to talk 
about the caper on condition of 
anonymity.
According to V.K., one of the 
thieves, it was not for monetary 
gain or for bragging rights that 
they decided to take the statue, but 
because of how easy they thought 
the caper would be.
We joked about stealing it, and 
one night, we were just chilling 
around, and me and [G.R., the 
other actor] are like, Lets go do it. 
It was more of'an impulsive deci
sion, said V.K.
The statue sits atop a large mag
azine stack, and the perpetrators 
went there first. In the Campus 
Police incident report, it was 
reported that a magazine, called 
Cavalier, was put in the statues 
place, implying that it was a clue or 
symbol to explain the suspects 
actions.
They thought the magazine 
being there was some kind of sym
bol. Not true. We didnt mean to 
put any magazine there. People 
would be walking by and wed just 
flip through random magazines,
said V.K.
We were sitting there, some 
kids were studying, and we were 
being shady as hell. I tried to lift it 
by myself, but it was [very] heavy. 
So me and [G.R] counted, pretty 
loudly, and lifted the statue, pretty 
loudly. Some kid who was studying 
turned around, saw the statue 
missing, moved on, he said.
When they found that the statue 
would not fit into the duffle bag 
they had brought, the two left the 
statue on the floor and went out
side to discuss the matter. About 
ten or fifteen minutes later, they 
returned.
The duffel bag wouldnt fit 
around the entire statue, so we just 
draped it over, shoddily.... We 
walked it over to the elevator, and 
went down, said V.K. Once on the 
bottom floor, V.K. left to make sure 
the coast was clear, leaving G.R., 
the other thief, in the elevator with 
the bust.
Im waiting in the elevator, and 
I get a call from [V.K.] saying not to 
come out, because the first thing 
that hed noticed was this camera 
just blatantly sitting right there, 
said G.R.
Everybodys like What is that? 
and Im trying to play it off like its 
an art project: a big, bronze, art 
project, said G.R.
He continued to ride up and 
down the elevator for about five 
minutes before getting off on the 
second floor and, with V.K.s help, 
moving the statue into the stair
well.
Now is the riskiest time, cause 
we have to take it down the stairs 
and walk it out the door.... Were 
discussing the strategy to get it out 
in the stairwell, and voices kind of 
echo, and people are walking by 
looking down at this thing, giving 
us weird looks, so basically every
body, in the library except the

program
by Kevin Chang
Staffwriter
The electrical and computer engi
neering department launched a new 
advising program last week that will 
put students in contact with more fac
ulty members and give students more 
information about their interests. ? r.
Organizers of the new program 
said that they were responding to stu
dents complaints about the old pro
grams inability to handle their needs:
There are so many more students 
than there were when the old pro
gram was put in place, said SuZie 
Laurich-Mclntyre, director of alumni 
and student relations for ECE. The 
ECE department currently has about 
600 students. Also, the department 
has grown in terms of course offer
ings and has added new degree 
tracks, including integrated mas
ters/bachelors programs and special
ty fields.
Under the new program, ECE stu
dents will be paired with advisors as 
sophomores and get mentors for the 
junior and senior years. Previously, 
professor Charles Neuman handled 
all advising roles. He has been the 
sole advisor for all ECE students since 
1994.
This isnt a reflection on professor 
Neuman at all, said Janet Peters, 
assistant for undergraduate educa
tion. Its impossible for one person to 
be meeting with 600 students and 
give good information.
He [Neuman] seemed very busy, 
went to him twice; it seemed like 1 
was really impatient, said Jem 
Zhang, a junior in ECE.
Neuman will serve as an advisor 
under the new program.
The 12-member Undergraduate 
Advising Committee will assign facul
ty advisors to all sophomores. In the 
fall of their sophomore year, students 
will take a weekly seminar about how 
the ECE department is organized, the 
curriculum, and what opportunities 
are available.
At the end of the sophomore year, 
each advisor will help his students 
choose a mentor for the junior and 
senior years, as well as the fifth year 
for students participating in 
integrated masters/bachelors pro
grams.
Last year, the department tried 
assigning each student a mentor at 
random to relieve stress on Neumans 
position, hut students complained 
that their interests often did not 
match their mentors specialty areas, 
so they did not get all of the benefits 
of having a mentor.
I wished I could have an advisor 
who would listen to me and who was 
interested in what I was interested 
in, said Zhang.
The faculty mentor will be based 
on [student] interest in the new pro
gram, so the mentor will be more 
helpful, said Laurich-Mclntyfe. It 
gives a student who really wants to do 
applied physics an advisor whose spe
cialty field is applied physics.
Laurich-Mclntyre also said that

Speaker lectures on life in Middle East
Nonie Darwish spoke to CMU students last Thursday about her childhood experiences in the area now known as the Gaza Strip
by Alexandra Kilduff
Staffwriter
Last Thursday, the Adamson 
Wing in Baker Hall was host to 
guest lecturer Nonie Darwish, a 
noted writer and speaker on ArabIsraeli relations. Sponsored by the 
Young Zionist Organization of 
America, Darwishs lecture was 
well-attended by students and pro
fessors of various backgrounds and 
opinions. The lecture focused pri
marily on Darwishs childhood in an 
Islamic nation and the cultural 
changes she has witnessed over the 
years, both in the Middle East and 
in America.
Following last months lecturer 
Ishmael Khaldi, Darwish also spoke 
from tne point of view of an Arab 
raised in Muslim culture who now 
supports the cause of Israel.
Darwish was born in Egypt and later 
spent part of her childhood in what 
is now considered the Gaza Strip. 
Her father was a prominent military 
officer who was later killed in action 
when Darwish was eight.
Darwish continued to live in 
Egypt until 1979, when she immi
grated to the United States. She now 
resides in southern California with 
her husband and three children.
Darwish decided to begin lectur
ing after September 11, 2001, 
regarding Muslim culture and antiSemitism in the Middle East.
Her talk on Thursday focused 
primarily on her support for Israel 
and her experiences with the 
Islamic culture and government in 
the country of Egypt during the 
50s and 60s, under the adminis
tration of President Nasur.

 University Police received a 
report that one of the two eight-foot 
cinder-block columns located on 
each side of the Morewood Gardens 
breezeway entrance door had fallen.
The columns weight was suspect
ed to have caused the anchors to 
separate from the building. The col
umn fell to the ground breaking it 
into pieces and blocking the 
entrance door.
The columns had been mostly 
used for decorative purposes, and 
the buildings support is not in dan
ger.
Loud Noise, 11/15/03, 1:49 am
 An officer responded to a noise 
complaint in a Morewood Gardens 
common area. Several students 
were dancing to music, and other 
people were also present.
The officer spoke to the resident 
providing the music, who claimed 
she had permission from her RA.
As the RA could not be found, the 
CA confirmed that quiet hours were 
indeed in effect.
The music was subsequently 
turned off.
Fighting, 11/16/03, 1:42 am 
Two males were reported on the 
Margaret Morrison St. helping 
another male who seemed intoxicatedwalk. They seemed to be fight
ing with each other, so the officer 
stopped the men and asked for their 
IDs.
They were CMU students, and 
one of the males was having diffi
cult standing up on his own, was 
slurring his speech, had red, glassy 
eyes, and smelled of an alcoholic 
beverage. The officer contacted 
EMS, and after their assessment it 
was decided that a doctor should 
see the student. City medics were 
dispatched and the intoxicated male 
was issued a state citation for the 
purchase, consumption, possession, 
and transportation of liquor or 
brewed malt beverages.
Fraternities: Locked in,
11/16/2003, 5:03 am  Two
police officers were dispatched to 
the Theta Xi fraternity house in 
response to a call from a brother 
who had claimed he was being 
locked in a room and beaten.
When they arrived on the scene, 
they heard loud yelling and things 
breaking. They knocked on the door 
and received no response, so the 
officers resorted to using a TESA 
card to gain entrance. They then 
noticed a young man running down 
the stairs in panic after he saw the 
officers presence. The man ran 
back into the house and began 
swinging at 5-6 brothers uncontrol
lably.
The officers took this young man 
aside and discovered he was the 
brother that had called the police. 
He stated that his brothers had 
locked him in his room, refused to 
let him out, and took $200 from his 
wallet. The brothers at Theta Xi told 
the officers that he was out of con
trol and had to lock him in his room. 
The officers took the him out of the 
room with some belongings and 
brought him to the station.
He went to stay with a Theta Xi 
brother that lived off campus.
Theft from Cyert Hall, 
11/17/03, 12:51 am  Several 
items were stolen from the Cyert 
A70 conference room. The com
plainant said that she had unlocked 
the room for occupants that were 
going to use the room on November 
12 at 3:00 pm.
Missing items were two empty
blue vases ($8 each) and a hot water 
pot ($150). These items had been 
sitting on the window still facing 
Forbes Avenue. The occupants that 
had used the room before said the 
items were still there when they had 
left.
Injuries to vehicle and foot, 
11/17/03, 11:22 am  A creamcolored 1999 Volkswagen was seen 
hitting the rear end of a 1989 
Oldsmobile. The driver of the 
Volkswagen said she didnt see that 
the Oldsmobile stopped, at which 
time she hit the car. A passenger in 
the Oldsmobile, a CMU student, had 
been exiting the right rear door at 
the same time as the impact. This 
caused his right foot to get caught 
under the right rear wheel. The 
damage to the Oldsmobile was a 
dented rear fender. The injury to the 
student was a brush burn to his right 
foot.
Criminal mischief, 11/19/03, 
5:50 pm  Campus police respond
ed to a call at Whitfield Hall, where 
a CMU administrator had discov
ered that the rear window of his 
2000 Honda CRV had been 
smashed. Nothing had been stolen 
from the vehicle and repair costs 
were unknown at the time.
Property Destroyed, 11/20/03, 
1:54 am  A fixture in Morewood 
Gardens E-Tower had been broken. 
Several witnesses were on hand and 
claimed to have been present at the 
time of the incident. The responding 
officer questioned three witnesses, 
none of whom could say they had 
actually seen the incident take 
place. The officer then questioned 
the suspect, who maintained that he 
did not destroy the fixture. The sus
pect was asked to remain in his 
room while the officer went to ques
tion several others. After question
ing several others, the officer could 
not conclude that the suspect had 
broken the light. The broken fixture 
was removed and placed in a dump
ster.

Gay frat begins 
colony at Syracuse
*
: (U-WIRE) SYRACUSE, N.Y.  Two 
Months ago, a Syracuse University 
4nd State University of New York 
(College of Environmental Science 
and Forestry (SUNY ESF) chapter of 
a gay fraternity was littie more than 
an idea in the heads of eight students.
; This weekend, the idea is nearly a 
reality.
Within the span of a week, we 
defined who we were, got a sense of 
where we were headed and started in 
that direction, said James Kaechele, 
an SUNY-ESF sophomore and presi
dent of the group.
Delta Lambda Phi (DLP), a nation
al fraternity for gay, bisexual and 
straight men, will become a colony 
Saturday at Syracuse University and 
SUNY ESF, officially becoming a part 
of the greek system.
To become a colony, the members 
must be inducted through rituals that 
will mark the formal beginning of the 
pledge education process, said Paul 
Mercurio, a SUNY-ESF graduate stu
dent in landscape architecture and
mentor of DLP. All of the members 
will receive a pin as well.
At least 11 brothers from different 
chapters around the country will 
come to Syracuse in celebration of 
the advancement, Kaechele said. The 
main event, a reception at the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender Resource Center on 
Saturday night, will allow guests and 
certain members of the university 
community to learn more about DLP 
and the pledges. The SU and SUNYESF members also will learn more 
about the fraternity as a national 
organization.
The colony will become a chapter 
by next December at the earliest, 
after three more pledge classes have 
gone through, Mercurio said.
DLP also challenges stereotypes of 
what it means to be in the Greek sys
tem and gives gay men another arena 
on campus to share a common identi
ty, McIntosh said. He said he does not 
yet know which fraternity council 
will recognize DLP.
When brainstorming how the 
group could raise funds, Mercurio 
thought of a cookie delivery service 
in Boston where people could order 
cookies that would arrive still hot at 
the buyer's door.
With that idea in mind, everyone 
met one Saturday at Mercurio's offcampus apartment for a full night
and day of baking.
I wonder what our heating bill 
will be like after having the stove on 
for like 24 hours, Mercurio said with 
a laugh.
Throughout the day, I kept going 
in there to steal cookies.
Together, they sold 101 boxes of 
the dozen chocolate chip and sugar 
cookies, at a price of $6 a box. After 
considering expenses, the group 
raised about $530, said George 
Northy, a sophomore and treasurer of 
the group.
But while the eight men filled out 
forms, held meetings, planned their 
goals and mastered their culinary 
skills, they developed the most 
important requirement for the frater
nity: brotherhood.
They bonded so deeply and quick
ly, Mercurio said.
They all get along so famously. It's 
a good number of people to be a 
founding class.
Accents trouble 
the hunt for jobs
(U-WIRE) PROVO, Utah  Many 
believed California Governor Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's foreign roots and 
Austrian accent would stop him from 
being elected as California's gover
nor.
But his diverse upbringing and 
intense drive proved critics otherwise 
 many immigrants face similar crit
icism.
Foreign accents are a continued 
obstacle for immigrants looking for 
employment and desiring to climb 
the latter of success.
Each country has its own linguistic 
sound. Accent-free speaking is hardly 
a reality.
Studies show people with foreign 
accents are discriminated against for 
not speaking crystal-clear English.
More than two years ago, a study 
by Blendstrup & Associates and inter
national professionals found that 
peoples accents get in the way of 
being hired.
Five individuals who were 
employed in the Silicon Valley and 
the San Francisco Bay Area were 
taped during a session of answering 
questions about their job.
The individuals were Korean, 
Japanese, Chinese, Argentine, French 
and German.
The study showed that individuals 
who could not be understood clearly 
were less likely to be hired. 
Employers said they worried that the 
peoples accents would interfere with 
customers, but said they would hire 
them for internal work.
More disturbingly, employers.... 
told me they actually would not hire
any of the people on the tape for 
more than low and mid-level jobs, 
stated the Blendstup & Associates 
report. And, if the accents were 
eventually not reduced to the point of 
being more understandable, the 
employees would probably not be 
promoted.
Employers listening to the tapes 
were not aware that the five individ
uals they had listened to already had 
prestigious, high-paying jobs as engi
neers, doctors and business consul
tants.
According to a report by Derwing, 
Rossiter, & Munro, a significant 
body of research shows that speakers 
with foreign accents may be viewed 
as less intelligent, less competent and 
even less attractive than native 
English speakers.
When employers discriminate 
because of accents, its usually 
because of ignorance, said 
Jacqueline Deaton, a Brigham Young 
University Spanish professor. People 
can tell I have an accent by just saying 
hi, but Ive never been denied a job 
or felt discriminated because of my 
accent.
Kwan encourages employers to 
learn more about different cultures 
and languages.
She said having a diverse work 
staff can only help to enhance busi
ness capabilities.

Georgian president 
resigns amid protests
TBILISI, Georgia (AP)  Georgian 
President Eduard Shevardnadze resigned 
Sunday as the opposition threatened to storm 
His residence. His fall sparked fireworks and 
chancing among tens of thousands of protest
ers, and ended a political crisis astonishing for 
its speed and lack of violence in a bloodwashed region.
I Shevardnadzes resignation caps a political 
career during which he won admiration in the 
\yest by helping guide the Cold War to an end 
ajs Soviet foreign minister under Mikhail 
Gorbachev. But during 10 years as president 
of Georgia, he became despised for rampant 
corruption.
! Residents of Tbilisi poured into streets and 
partied late into the night after the resigna
tion was announced, honking car horns and 
waving flags on the capitals main Rustaveli 
Avenue. Champagne corks flew, and revelers 
placed flowers into the machine gun barrels 
of two armored personnel carriers blocking a 
street.
* The United States and European Union 
expressed cautious support for the new lead
ers while urging them to pursue stability, 
abide by the constitution and hold democrat
ic elections.
Georgia lies at a crossroads important to 
both the United States and Russia, on the 
planned path of an oil pipeline between the 
landlocked Caspian Sea and the ports of the 
Black Sea. The Caucasus nation has seen two 
bloody separatist movements under 
Shevardnadzes rule since 1992.
Throughout nearly three weeks of protests 
 since parliament elections that the opposi
tion said were rigged  both sides, mindful of 
Georgias history of fatal political conflicts, 
had pledged to avoid provocations. 
Shevardnadze said maintaining peace was 
paramount in his decision to resign.
1 realized that what is happening may end with 
spilled blood if I use my rights to use force against 
the protesters, he said on national television.
During the crisis, Shevardnadze consulted 
by telephone repeatedly with Russian 
President Vladimir Putin, with whom he had 
often quarreled. The decision to resign just 
hours after the arrival of the Russian foreign 
minister could indicate the Kremlin is trying 
to reassert influence in Georgia.
Work on N. Korea 
reactors suspended
NEW YORK (AP)  The United States, 
South Korea, Japan and the European Union 
decided Friday to suspend construction of two 
nuclear reactors in North Korea, which is sus
pected of secretly developing atomic 
weapons.
The four are members of the Korean 
Peninsula Energy Development Organization 
executive board, which had been building the 
light-water reactors under a 1994 deal 
between the United States and North Korea. 
The reactors were meant to come online in 
2007.
The light-water reactors, difficult to adapt to 
nuclear weapons production, were meant to 
replace three North Korean reactors that are 
able to produce weapons-grade plutonium.
Recently the Bush administration is talk
ing about offering a security guarantee for our 
country, but the slander by Rumsfeld, who 
leads the U.S. policy, shows that the security 
guarantee is nothing more than a play aimed 
at deceiving us, KCNA, the Norths official 
news agency, said in a commentary. The com
mentary was monitored by South Koreas 
Yonhap news agency.
This shows that it is only right for us to 
increase the nuclear deterrent force, KCNA said.
North Korea has accused Washington of 
planning a pre-emptive attack against it, after 
labeling the communist country part of an 
axis of evil along with Iran and Iraq.
Diplomatic efforts to resume the six-nation 
conference gained speed last month after 
North Korea agreed in principle to return to 
the negotiating table. Pyongyang also 
dropped its demand for a nonaggression 
treaty with Washington, saying it would con
sider President Bushs offer for written securi
ty assurances from the United States and 
North Koreas neighbors.

2004 class of Rhodes 
Scholars announced
BOSTON (AP)  The newest class of Rhodes 
Scholars includes a soldier on his way to Iraq, a 
political science major who has worked with 
refugees in the Balkans and Afghanistan, and a 
national Frisbee champion who was a contribut

As the winners were announced late Saturday 
and early Sunday, many of the finalists waited 
impatiently at ceremonies in cities around the 
country.
Harvard led the class of 2004  the 100th

dren, and his bizarre but short-lived attempt to 
represent himself at trial.
Although prosecutors in the two cases pre
sented much of the same crime scene evidence, 
the juries direct exposure to the men on trial for 
their lives has been dramatically different.
During a week of testimony on the shootings 
that killed 10 and wounded three in the 
Washington area last fall, Malvos jurors heard 
more than three hours of taped police and FBI 
interviews. In them, Malvo confessed to pulling 
the trigger in each shooting, bragged about his 
shooting prowess and explained the sniper plan 
by weaving together the philosophical, logistical 
and nonsensical.
I intended to kill them all, said Malvo, 17 at 
the time of the interviews.
Prosecutors say Malvo knew exactly what he 
was doing, while defense lawyers argue he was 
brainwashed by Muhammad and legally insane 
at the time of the shootings. He is charged only 
in the killing of FBI analyst Linda Franklin, shot 
outside a Home Depot store in Falls Church on 
October 14,2002. A short drive away, in Virginia 
Beach, Muhammads jury, which convicted him 
last week in the killing of Dean Harold Meyers at 
a Manasass gas station and resumes sentencing 
deliberations Monday, has heard no confession, 
no testimony from the defendants and no men
tal health information.
Malvo told police the shootings were all about 
money and would have continued until the gov
ernment paid them off if they hadnt been cap
tured.He also said he expected them both to be 
executed.
Thats the consequence of failure, death, he 
told FBI agent Brad Garrett on one tape.
What Muhammads jury knows of him per
sonally comes from the two days in which he 
represented himself, other peoples testimony 
and home videos of him playing with his chil
dren. Before the trial began, Muhammad 
refused to meet with the states mental health 
evaluators, which barred his lawyers from pre
senting their psychological evidence.
The defense expects to put up to nine mental 
health experts and more than 60 lay witnesses 
on the stand.

Carnegie Library 
branch reopens 
PITTSBURGH (AP)  The fist 
branch of the Carnegie Library of 
Pittsburgh to be completely reno
vated under a project worth more 
than $40 million has reopened.
Library staff, patrons and com
munity leaders over the weekend 
celebrated the completion of the 
Homewood branchs $3.5 million 
makeover. \
The 100-year-old building had 
been closed since January as work
ers remodeled the branchs eleva
tor, auditorium, meeting rooms, 
restrooms, and several other 
amenities.
The library system was paid for 
$2.5 million of the project through 
a bond issue by the Allegheny 
County Regional Asset District, 
which collects a one percent sales 
tax add-on. The rest of the money 
came from the state Department >f 
Community and Econorrfic 
Development and other agencies.
The Homewood branch is the 
first of 14 libraries, including the 
main library in the Oakland sec
tion of Pittsburgh, to undergo ren
ovations, said library spokes
woman Lane Cigna.
Few healthI
workers in PA
I
PITTSBURGH (AP) 
Pennsylvania has the fewest public 
health workers per capita than any 
other state in the nation, according 
to a report recently presented to 
the American Public Health 
Association.
The state has 37 public health 
workers for every 100,000 people, 
while the national average is 1^8 
for every 100,000 people. Soufh 
Carolina, which has the most pub
lic health workers per capita, has 
566 for every 100,000 people, 
according to a report presented to 
the association last week.
The report, compiled for the 
U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services by Kristine 
Gebbie of the Center for Health 
Policy at the Columbia University 
School of Nursing, examined 
staffing in 50 states, six territories 
and Washington, D.C.
Pennsylvania is a large state; 
its an important state, Gebbie 
said. It has major transportation 
and tourism, and so its surprising 
that the system is not more devel
oped. \
When the state experiences a 
public health emergency, such as 
the hepatitis A outbreak in Beaver 
County, its resources are pushed to 
the limit, said Dr. Stephen B. 
Thacker, the director of the 
Epidemiology Program Office at 
the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.
The Pennsylvania Department 
of Health is leading the investiga
tion into the hepatitis A outbreak 
that killed three people and sick
ened more than 600 who ate taint
ed green onions at a Chi-Chijs 
restaurant in Beaver County. The 
investigation is entering its fourth 
week and many public workers 
have had to work long hours, offi
cials said.
Thacker said the CDC can help 
out during public health emergen
cies, but theres going to be a limjt 
even to the CDC.
Public health experts have not 
criticized how the state health 
department handled the hepatitis 
A outbreak, but Gebbie doubis 
whether the state would have been 
able to handle a second public 
health emergency during the last 
few weeks.
When you dont have much 
depth, the secondary emergency 
becomes a disaster, because ycai 
have to either pull people off thye 
first emergency or you dont eveji 
notice the second one is starting; 
Gebbie said.
The hepatitis A outbreak 
demonstrated that the states 
health department responded 
quickly, department spokesman 
Richard McGarvey said.
Fortunately, there wasnt a sec
ond outbreak at the same timej 
McGarvey said. Can I predict fc 
response? No.
Pennsylvanias lack of local 
health departments is one of the 
reasons for the states low ratio of 
health workers per capita. 
Allegheny County and seven other 
counties and municipalities have 
local health agencies, but many 
Pennsylvania counties, including 
Beaver County, do not.
The state has 4465 public health 
workers who are employed by 
state, local and private agencie$, 
according to Gebbies report. 
About 1400 of them are employed 
by the state, McGarvey said.
In South Carolina, which leacCs 
the country in the amount of public 
health workers per capita, every 
county has a health department 
and the state provided some money 
for those agencies, Gebbie said.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 24, 2003
Senate committee publishes budgetsrlccl tpukl cesousn 
eslis ofs SM dlEpTu
HAZING, from page A1
by Christina Kung
Assistant News Editor
At the beginning of the fall 2003 
semester, Student Senate set in 
motion a new committee to super
vise budget allocations for every stu
dent organization. The 
Transparency and Accountability in 
Student Government Committee 
(TASC) convened on October 17 to 
publish the Senate budget for 2003.
To be a good Senate, we have to 
be responsible for every action we 
take, and that includes how we 
spend, and how much. This is what 
transparency in a government is all 
about, said Sivanipriya Nattama, 
co-chair of TASC and a fifth-year 
senior in CS.
The Student Senate allocates 
approximately $30,000 every year to 
various organizations, apart from 
their original budgets, for the bene
fit of the whole student body. While 
the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) 
was created to supervise and work 
with funded student organizations, 
TASC was designed with the goal of 
publishing this budgeting and 
spending of the Senate. Currently, 
the TASC is concerned with the 
budgets of the Senate, and especial
ly its allocation to the Student 
Activities Board.
The Student Activities Board is 
really intertwined with the Senate, 
they act as an ex-officio at the meet
ings, said Steven Kling, the other 
co-chair of TASC, They are an exter
nal standing committee. AB receives 
approximately 35 percent of the 
funds in JFC. At the beginning of 
every semester, every student, 
undergraduate and graduate, pays 
$74 for a student activities fee. This 
money is then split up for under
graduate use (special allocations) 
and graduate use (Graduate Student
BUST, from page A1
librarian knew, said G.R.
Finally, 45 minutes [after we 
started] it was go-time. We just open 
the door, pick up the statue, and 
walk the hell outta there, said V.K.
They then carried the statue about 
100 yards from the door of Hunt to 
Frew Street, where they waited for 
another friend to bring a car. After 
being accosted by six or seven guys 
asking for handshakes and compli
menting the two on their bravery, 
the escape car drove up, and they 
returned to their house with every 
reason to believe they had been suc1 cessful.
As soon as we noticed it was miss
ing, I searched the entire library. 
Once I did that, I realized it was no 
' longer in the building, so I felt it was 
' necessary to cast a wider net, said 
Michalek. I knew that the sooner 
we got it back the better, because the 
longer these things go, the less likely 
you are getting something like this 
back.
Michalek also called several par
ties at student life and Student 
Affairs, and began the campaign to 
recover the bust. There were many 
possibilities to examine.
We didnt know if it was a staff 
member, or a subcontractor for the 
university, or a student. We didnt 
want to jump to the conclusion that 
it was one type of person or anoth
er, she said.
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs, wrote in an e-mail to The 
Tartan saying the administration 
contacted Campus Police, members 
of the Student Affairs staff, and stu
dent leaders to ask them to be vigi
lant.
It was clear that it was a prank, 
with no malicious intent, so we 
expected that it would show up 
unharmed, wrote Murphy, still, 
the amusement of it wore off pretty 
quickly when it was not returned, 
and we became concerned that 
someone might damage it, even if 
[sic] unintentionally.
Meanwhile, the thieves and their 
housemates, after seeing e-mails 
sent out by the administration 
regarding the bust, and hearing 
numerous warnings from concerned 
friends, moved the bust from its for' mer spot in their living room to the
Association). However, both sides 
contribute money to the Joint 
Funding Committee (JFC), which 
allots the initial budget for each rec
ognized student organization.
In past years, the Student Senate 
has tried to pass legislation to organ
ize and handle this division of treas
ury in a more accountable manner. 
The Freedom of Information Act was 
passed by the Senate last year, but 
vetoed by then-Student Body 
President Brian Namey. The Tartan 
reported 
[Namey vetoes 
freedom of infor
mation act,
10/14/02] that 
In his veto,
Namey stated 
that a non-trivial number of 
students do not 
understand the 
legislation, [it] 
is unnecessarily 
ambiguous, Student Government 
does not have the resources to exe
cute the legislation, and the process 
by which the legislation was passed 
was unconstitutional. 
To address the concerns that the 
Freedom of Information Act 
attempted to address, the Internal 
Affairs Committee of the senate 
formed the TASC, which accounts 
for mostly AB and Senate alloca
tions.
I think, if implemented correctly, 
[the Freedom of Information Act] 
could clean up a lot of things that 
arent so great about the JFC 
process every spring and the record
keeping process during the year. 
However, there are many issues to 
think about before simply making 
everything available, said Chris 
Smoak, chair of Activities Board and 
senior in computer science and psy
chology.
basement as a precaution.
We dressed it up, put hats and 
ties on it. We even named it: we 
called it Andy, said G.R.
Although they never openly 
demonstrated their possession of the 
bust, they also did not hide the fact 
that they had the artifact in their 
possession, which led to the eventu
al leak to the administration of their 
identity. They also refuted the rumor 
that there was a party, or multiple 
parties, celebrating the theft, 
though they did have parties while 
the bust was in their possession. I 
asked John Hannon and Jamie Rossi 
[who lives across the street from the 
suspects] if they would talk to the 
students and tell them that we 
would consider it a harmless prank,
... they said ...if 
we didnt let 
them in, the next 
people to come to 
my house would 
be the Pittsburgh 
police.
 V.K.
however misguided, if [they] could 
ensure its immediate safe return. 
They agreed, and so it went, wrote 
Murphy
According to the culprits, their 
confrontation with Hannon and 
Rossi caught them completely off
guard. V.K. described the encounter, 
saying that it started when he heard 
a knock on his door one afternoon.
All of a sudden, I turn around and 
I see my neighbor from across the 
street and this other guy come in, 
V.K. said. Expecting to hear a com
plaint about noise, he was surprised 
to hear them begin talking about the 
missing statue, and say that some
one identified their house as being 
in possession of it.
They wanted to see my base
ment, and I wasnt about to let them
The smaller scale allows Student 
Senate to pay close attention to their 
budget and account for their own 
spending.
The budget information that is 
posted is password-protected, so 
only Carnegie Mellon students and 
faculty may view it.
The Activities Board works like a 
business; it makes sense for students 
to see budgets, but it doesnt make 
sense for the outside world to see 
how AB gets money, said Nattama. 
They are only trying to protect their 
interests and the interests of the stu
dent body.
There is the feeling that we 
should be free and open to the entire 
campus, said Kling, but we need a 
level of confidentiality. For example, 
AB holds many concerts, and if a 
company were to see our budgets, 
they might base their prices on how 
much we can offer.
Nattama believes the goal of TASC 
is to work on a smaller scale and 
then gradually work up to a point 
where all organizations will have 
their budgets set and published for 
all CMU students to view.
One of the challenges of this is 
that many of the clubs would be hes
itant to be accountable for every 
dollar they spend, said Nattama, 
given our hectic schedules, it 
would also be hard to put it all 
together.
TASC is still in the process of post
ing up actual expenditures, and 
forming a written policy. Kling said 
he hopes to have this done as a part 
of a final report by December 4. In 
this way, student government will 
have something to work with in 
future years.
TASC is necessary because if we 
dont feel comfortable sharing what 
we spend, said Kling, we shouldnt 
even be spending it. This is the 
rationale behind it all.
... but then they started telling me 
that nothing would happen, and that 
wed get total immunity, but that if 
we didnt let them in, the next peo
ple to come to my house would be 
the Pittsburgh police.
V.K.s next move was to go upstairs 
and wake G.R. At first, G.R. was in 
disbelief, but once he saw that V.K. 
was serious, they discussed what to 
do. Rather than have the police and 
other parties come by, they gave 
Hannon and Rossi the statue.
We had our fun with it, said V.K. 
But what seemed the most ironic 
to them was the speech Hannon and 
Rossi gave them.
They told us, You cant imagine 
how many university hours have 
been spent strategizing on how to 
get the statue back. I was like, wow, 
you guys shouldve put one hour in 
beforehand to put a glass case 
around it, said V.K. I could go back 
and steal it again right now.
The point raised by V.K is the 
question of how adequate is security 
around such an artifact that could 
allow such a hastily-planned heist to 
succeed. Murphy wrote in his e-mail: 
I dont think we need to take any 
action to prevent such activities in 
the future. I imagine the bust quick
ly became something of an albatross 
for them, and I suspect they were 
glad to get it back safe and sound. 
The students who took the bust 
were disappointed at its loss. They 
mentioned plans to keep the statue 
after they graduated.
Michalek said, We do have secu
rity around our artwork. I dont want 
to tell you what steps are taken, but 
we do have security around our art
work. We put it out there. We believe 
that our University is a cultural cen
ter, and that part of that environ
ment is to expose people to works of 
art.... I would say that what you see 
on display has less monetary value, 
so we put it out there, and we hope 
that people wont steal it.
Michalek said that library staff 
had been reminded to keep a better 
watch over the library, but that there 
were no plans to bolt everything 
down.
We want to be able to trust stu
dents; we want to believe that our 
students are mature enough to 
respect artwork and the environ
ment were trying to build, she said.
given the option to start a new 
pledge book and obtain signatures 
from brothers for it again, or per
form the ascribed task. Pledges also 
say that they were forced to take and 
paint the fence to get two of the sig
natures they needed for their pledge 
books. They had to pay for the sup
plies with their own money. The 
night they took the fence also hap
pened to be the night of a violent 
thunderstorm.
Spring pledges say that the frater
nity strongly promoted the idea of 
moving into the house. Pledges that 
did move in say that were charged 
for items they were never told about 
which they discovered only later 
when receiving their bills. They also 
say they were charged for things 
they did not receive, such as tshirts, or formais that they did not 
attend.
Pledges that moved in also added 
that they were inconvenienced 
many times by brothers claiming to 
need them to vacate their rooms for 
meetings. They say they would often 
come home to the fraternity to find a 
sign on their door saying that they 
had to leave the house for the dura
tion of the meeting and they would 
have to find somewhere else to stay 
for the night. One pledge said on 
more than one occasion he ended up 
sleeping in the Morewood lounge.
I was very disappointed in the

mentor changes would be allowed at 
any time for students whose inter
ests change or for any other reason. 
Current ECE upperclassmen 
received an e-mail on October 16 in 
which they were asked to select 
three possible mentors from among 
the staff or provide an area of inter
est.
Student reaction to the program 
was positive.
I think [the new program] is 
good because its more personal and 
less confusing, said ECE junior 
Neema Jain.
The faculty seem, for the most 
part, pretty excited about the new
whole experience. This was a housespecific problem, said one of the 
pledges, also saying that he supports 
the fraternity system as a whole but 
was not happy with what happened 
at Kappa Sigma. Pledges also said 
that they felt that the entire pledg
ing process at Kappa Sigma was 
really just a business transaction.
[The fraternities] want double 
digits [number of pledges]. Its a 
business pretty much, said a mem
ber of the spring pledge class. 
Boucek also noted that the attitude 
of the brothers changed a lot once 
they were no longer pledges.
Its a business proposition. As 
soon as youre out of the house, its 
like see ya,  said Boucek.
Pledges also say that brothers 
have apologized to them for what 
happened and made a concerted 
effort to get the pledges back.
They have told us they fucked 
up, said one of them.
According to Renee Camerlengo 
of the Universitys Student Life 
office, the University has not a 
received a formal report of the alle
gations but the University would be 
willing to assist anyone who would 
like to file a report.
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs, said he was not aware of the 
situation.
Adam Welander and Chris 
Racusen, outgoing and incoming 
Kappa Sigma Presidents, had no 
comment.
program, said Peters.
About 50 faculty members have 
signed up so far to be sophomore 
advisors, upperclass mentors, or 
both.
We are going to be assessing the 
project as we go along, said 
Laurich-Mclntyre. She said that 
deployment of the project is ongo
ing.
We have to follow this and make 
sure its working, said Peters. We 
need to find out if this will meet the 
needs of the students.
Participation in the advising pro
gram is not mandatory. About half 
of the students have already signed 
up, and sign-ups are continuing 
now.
Arab-Israeli
relations
discussed
DARWISH, from page A1
Although from a Muslim back
ground, Darwish stressed repeatedly 
in her lecture the detrimental influ
ence of a militant government on 
Middle Eastern Islamic culture.
The perception I see in the Middle 
East is that one has to hate the enemy 
of Islam to be a good Muslim, she 
said.
She also stressed her involvement 
with the Israeli cause, referencing 
her membership to Hadassah, a 
Jewish womens organization, and 
her personal experiences with 
Israelis both in the Middle East and 
in America.
Darwishs appearance was 
arranged by the Young Zionist 
Organization of America, a student 
organization.
The club was founded by CMU stu
dents Polina Vanyukov, Jacques Katz, 
and Kobi Wimisberg.
Im not a confrontational person, 
said Vanyukov, a senior in modern 
languages. But I feel that it is very 
important for me to get involved 
somehow. At the very least, this 
shows that people are aware.
Besides those who support the 
Zionist movement, the audience 
included people from various back
grounds and ethnicities. This includ
ed students of Muslim religion and 
Palestinian or Egyptian ethnic back
ground.
The Tartan attempted to reach 
members of the Arab Students 
Organization and the Palestinian 
Solidarity Committee, but they were 
unavailable for comment on the lec
ture.
After the lecture, students and fac
ulty were invited to ask Darwish 
questions regarding her background 
and opinions.
Concerned about the controversy 
surrounding Khaldis lecture and the 
political charge of Darwishs state
ments, CMU had posted a police offi
cer in the hall. However, the question-and-answer period was unevent
ful.
They asked me to come down 
here, just in case, but I think they 
were expecting something, very dif
ferent, said officer Ivan Howard. 
Indicating Mrs. Darwish, he added, 
She sure does bring a lot of ques
tions, though.

Berkeley prof 
lectures on 
game theory
by Alex Meseguer
News Editor
When people are selfish, networks 
dont work as well  so said Christos
H. Papadimitriou, a professor of com
puter science at the University of 
California at Berkeley, in his lecture 
to a packed Wean 7500 last Thursday. 
People sat on the steps of the inclined 
lecture hall to hear Games and 
Networks, an overview of his effort 
to find out how to build computer sys
tems that take human behavior into 
account.
The Santa Claus-like
Papadimitriou spoke with a thick 
Greek accent, inserting witticisms 
and jokes that, although sometimes 
labored, the crowd ate up nonethe
less.
He started with 
a very simplistic 
overview of the 
first 50 years of 
the Internet, 
mentioning that 
at first there 
were all these 
computers, and 
some clever 
people created a 
ltfMcn.c network that
zbsbuMdMnfM.a connected them
all.
[The] Internet is novel because its 
not a thing designed by a single enti
ty, said Papadimitriou. It is made by 
thousands of selfish, greedy entities. 
He said that computer scientists must 
study the Internet as other scientists 
study nature  through developing 
mathematical theories. He went on to 
enumerate the reasons why it is 
worth studying, mentioning that 
some people might not think it is 
worth studying because it already 
works. Papadimitriou said that 
computer scientists had no choice in 
studying it  that it was a fascinating 
artifact and also not a finished 
product, because it is always evolving

Entertainment Technology Centers Building Virtual Worlds class.
by John Davin
Contributing Editor
About two miles from the CMU 
campus, in the Entertainment 
Technology Center (ETC) building, 
students are worldng to build inter
active virtual worlds.
Building Virtual Worlds (BVW), a 
twelve-unit class offered by the 
ETC, is likely the only course at 
CMU that motivates undergraduate 
students enough to take a bus two 
miles to get to class, and sometimes 
spend over 40 hours a week in their
home away from home.
In the class, groups of students 
from different majors create virtual 
reality environments in five twoweek-long projects. The typical 
group has a programmer, modeler, 
painter, and designer or producer. 
This semesters class has 50 stu
dents, about half of them under
graduates and half ETC masters 
students.
The class is taught by Randy 
Pausch, a professor of computer sci
ence. Pausch and Don Marinelli, a 
professor of drama, are the co-direc
tors of the ETC. BVW has a reputa
tion for being fun, yet time-intensive.
Some people work here 40 hours 
a week, said Kyle Gray, an ETC 
masters student.
Towards the end, some people 
will just sleep here, he said.
Regarding other courses, ETC 
masters student Brad Stokan said, 
Everything else gets prioritized to 
the bottom of the list.
The course is unusual for its very 
diverse teams  students from art, 
design, computer science, mechani
cal engineering, music, and other 
majors all work together on virtual 
worlds.
Im in design, and we usually 
dont get to work with really nerdy 
kids, said senior Sam Hart.
Robert Gordon, an ETC masters 
student, felt that the course is chal
lenging because it involves so many 
different fields.
You have to deal with artistic 
constraints, technical constraints, 
and other peoples time con
straints, said Gordon.
Historically, many of the stu-. 
dents in this course go on to work at 
places like Electronic Arts, Disney 
Imagineering, Pixar, Industrial 
Light & Magic (ILM), and other 
high-profile companies, wrote 
Pausch in an e-mail to The Tartan.
Each year, the class holds an end 
of the year show, which has tradi
tionally had enough attendees to fill 
McConomy Auditorium. This years
show will be held on December 10 
at 7 pm in McConomy. Students in 
the course will demonstrate their 
creations by donning a virtual reali
ty helmet that will put them inside 
their 3D virtual world. All worlds 
are interactive, so the student wear
ing the helmet will make decisions 
and affect outcomes within the 
world.
The students virtual reality dis
play will be duplicated to a large 
projection screen for the audience 
to see.
It all comes down to 90 seconds, 
and youre like, Oh god, please 
work, said John Bellinger, a 
mechanical engineering senior in 
the BVW class. Since the human 
interaction with the virtual world is 
not pre-scripted, there is potential 
for mistakes or unexpected results 
during the show.
According to Pausch, about 15 
projects will be presented during 
the show.
He also hopes to have some of the 
student worlds available for guests 
to try before and after the exhibi
tion.
In early December, a jury will 
judge the projects submitted for 
consideration and select those to be 
presented in the show. Most groups 
submit their final project for consid
eration, and some also submit pro
jects that were done earlier in the 
course.
Jesse Schell, a professor of enter
tainment technology, was on the 
selection board last year and will be 
on the jury again this year.
The most important thing is, is it 
entertaining? said Schell. BVW 
stresses that each project should 
impress the audience in some way 
and make them say wow.
Sometimes people overreach so 
far that they cant possibly succeed, 
said Schell. If a group attempted 
something very difficult, but were 
not able to get it to work as hoped,

These days, its fairly easy to take 
high-quality printed output for 
granted. Desktop laser printers can 
be had for a few hundred dollars, 
and here at Carnegie Mellon, you 
can print all you want for free to any 
number of printers operated by the 
University. I have three laser print
ers in my room, two of which I res
cued from the trash.
But certainly you remember the 
days of clunky, noisy dot-matrix 
printers that really couldnt rival 
the clear, crisp text of an electric 
typewriter. And even long after 
laser printers had become common
place in businesses, their high price 
meant that home computer users 
usually had to settle for inkjet print
ers that produced laser-quality 
text (as long as you didnt actually 
compare it side-by-side with a laserprinted document).
The laser printer has come a long 
way since researchers at Xeroxs 
Palo Alto Research Center (also the 
source of the Graphical User 
Interface and Ethernet) developed 
their first working prototype in 
1971.
Its not hard to figure out that a 
dot matrix printer pushes an inky 
ribbon against your paper in a tight 
matrix of pixels, and that an inkjet, 
as its name implies, squirts dots of 
ink onto the page to accomplish the 
same thing.
Whats not so obvious, as youre 
standing there waiting for the cover 
sheet with your Andrew ID to get 
spit out by the whirring machine, is 
what a laser has to do with putting
an image on a piece of paper.
The laser doesnt actually interact 
directly with the paper. To get the 
image on the paper, the laser print
er relies on a process known as 
xerography, which was patented in 
1938, and made its commercial 
debut ten years later in the first 
clumsy photocopiers.
When a laser printer receives a 
print job from your computer, its 
onboard computer turns those data 
into a pattern of dots (pixels) corre
sponding to the printers maximum 
resolution. While this is happening, 
a photosensitive (i.e., light-sensi
tive) roller is rotating so that its sur
face passes by a wire that gives it a 
positive charge of static electricity.
Then, the laser works its way 
across this roller, pixel by pixel, line 
by line. As the roller rotates, the 
laser beam moves across it, turning 
on and off, drawing the image on 
the roller by discharging the pixels 
that make up the image. Since the 
roller is sensitive to light, any area 
on which the laser shines develops 
a negative charge.
A rotating mirror assembly and a 
special lens keep the laser beam 
perpendicular to the paper at all 
times, maintaining the proportions 
of the image.
After a part of the photosensitive 
roller gets drawn on by the laser, 
it comes in contact with another 
roller thats part of the toner car
tridge. If youve ever wondered why 
the black stuff that you put in laser 
printers (and photocopiers) isnt 
called ink, its because that rather 
than a liquid, its a powder. The 
toner roller has a negative charge, 
which allows the positively-charged 
toner to stick to it (you may remem
ber from physics class or a previous 
edition of this column that opposite 
charges attract). However, the neg
ative charge on the toner roller isnt 
as strong as the one that the laser 
imparted to selected areas of the 
photosensitive roller  when the 
two come in contact, toner is trans
ferred to the negatively-charged 
areas of the photosensitive drum.
As the paper is drawn through 
the printer, it comes in contact with 
a wire or roller that gives it a nega
tive charge stronger than the one 
that is binding the toner to the pho
tosensitive roller. When the paper is 
brought into contact with the pho
tosensitive roller  you guessed 
itthe toner representing the 
image is transferred to the paper. 
(Immediately after picking up the 
toner from the drum, another wire 
discharges the paper so it doesnt 
cling to the roller.)
So now you have what looks like 
a laser-quality printed page. The 
only problem is that the image on 
the page is made up of loose pow
der that will blow away in a slight 
breeze, which brings us to the last 
part of the printer that your paper 
passes through: the fuser. The fuser 
is basically an oven that, as its name 
suggests, fuses the toner to the 
paper. The heat melts the toner as 
the paper is passed between two 
hard metal rollers. Thats why the 
printed output from laser printers 
and photocopiers is always warm 
when it comes out.
The image is melted into the top 
layer of the paper, so while inkjet 
output will get runny and fade 
when it gets wet, laser printer out
put will hold up to the rain as long 
as your paper will.

found that most American students do less than an hour of homework a night.

CMU researchers find constant amount over last half-century
by Susan Peich
Junior Staffwriter
In high school, sophomore cre
ative writing major Allison Pottern 
recalls doing a lot of homework.
I probably did about two or three 
hours per night, she said.
Like most Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, Potterns high school curricu
lum followed an academic track lit
tered with honors and Advanced 
Placement courses. Although most 
high school courses demand hours 
of homework nightly, a recent study 
shows that the majority of Americas 
students spend less than one hour 
per day doing homework.
Steve Schlossman, a Carnegie 
Mellon professor of history, and 
Brian Gill, a CMU alumnus and 
researcher for the RAND 
Corporation, conducted a study of 
exactly how much time students 
spend doing homework per night 
and found that the amount has held 
relatively constant over the last fifty 
years.
Their motivations for doing the 
study were both historical and per
sonal.
Homework is a bond between 
the teacher, parent/and student, 
said Schlossman. His child went 
from a public elementary school 
that didnt give out homework to a 
private school that gave five to six 
hours of work per night.
Since the beginning of the 20th 
century, the arguments against the 
amount of homework assigned to 
kids have been the same: 
Homework interferes with family 
life and undermines parents ability 
to judge how kids use their free 
time.
According to Schlossman, the 
argument against homework comes 
from a vocal minority.
The media has misrepresented 
what most parents think, he said, 
citing that most parents want chil
dren to have homework; they just 
question how constructive the work 
is and what value the teacher places 
on it once it is complete.
Schlossman and Gill focused their 
study on how many kids said that 
they did more than two hours of 
homework per day. They looked at 
students in kindergarten throughSee HOMEWORK, page A6

50th anniversary 
of Piltdown hoax
The Piltdown man was the oldest 
fossil humanoid found in Britain. For 
almost 40 years, the fragmented 
remains were the closest thing that 
paleontologists had found to the 
missing link between humans and 
lesser apes.
But in November 1953, tests proved 
that the fossils had been chemically 
aged to appear much older than the 
few hundred years old that they were. 
Far from being the missing link, the 
bone fragments were from a medieval 
orangutan.
This confirmed the suspicions that 
scientists had about the fragments, as 
research that was going on then sug
gested that the shape of mans skull 
had evolved in a different way. The 
original fossils are back on display at 
the Natural History Museum in 
Britain.

Southern speech 
confounds system
The police department in 
Shreveport, Louisiana, is taking a 
technological step back from their 
new voice system, as Southern drawls 
made the system untenable.
In Louisiana, we have a problem 
with Southern drawl and what I call 
lazy mouth, said Captain John Dunn, 
who oversees communication in the 
department. Because of that, the sys
tem often doesnt recognize what 
[callers] say.
The system was used to route noncritical calls to the person or depart

Congress passes 
bill to thin forests
Last Friday, Congress passed a bill 
that will spend about three-quarters 
of a billion dollars to prevent under
growth from causing massive forest 
fires like the recent ones in southern 
California.
The bill will ease environmental 
reviews and judicial processes for fed
eral forests, and allow the local 
foresters more input on how suscepti
ble an area is to a large fire.
President Bush, who had spoken 
out about the danger posed by mis
guided forest management last year, 
is expected to sign the bill when it 
reaches his desk.
Environmental groups and some 
Democrats spoke out against the bill, 
saying that the bill doesnt target the 
areas most in need of forest thinning
 those near residential areas. They 
also fear that the bill was crafted to 
favor the lumber industry.
At least half of the money allocated 
in the bill must go to forest thinning 
around residential areas. Another 
requirement of the bill is that the U.S. 
Forest Service and courts must explic
itly evaluate the risks of inaction and 
action, and propose an alternative, if 
possible.

Hole in ozone has 
closed up again
The hole in the ozone layer over 
Antarctica has sealed itself as the 
temperatures there have risen. The 
hole had lasted for a longer time than 
had ever been measured before, and 
also matched the greatest area cov
ered  10.81 million square miles, 
last reached in 2000.
The ozone hole first formed in the 
mid to late 1980s and is caused by 
chemical pollutants, chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
These chemicals have been phased 
out worldwide, though their effects 
are still being felt. It will take approx
imately 50 years for the level of CFCs 
to go low enough that the hole will no 
longer form.
Ozone is one of the primary com
ponents of smog. In the upper atmos
phere, ozone breaks down when 
exposed to ultraviolet radiation, dissi
pating the radiation, and then slowly 
reforms.

Prof talks about games
GAMES, from page A5
as more and more users add to and 
change the network.
He went on to give various exam
ples of situations where game theory 
can be applied to determine the ben
efits, and hence the behavior, of all 
involved. Among these was the game 
of chicken, which he compared to 
traveling on a two-way highway in 
Greece. Players of some games 
should introduce elements of chance 
into their strategies, he said, and gave 
the example of the goalies options in 
soccer.
This is what all goalies do; they 
flip a coin, said Papadimitriou.
After introducing game theory, he 
placed it in the context of computer 
systems and networks. The price of 
anarchy, or letting people do what
ever they want in using a system, 
opens up the possibility that they will 
use the system in as selfish a way as 
possible. According to Papadimitriou, 
everyone is selfish, so everyone will 
pick the quickest path in any net
work, causing traffic congestion and 
slowing it down for everyone else. 
However, when there is social inter
vention, efficiency is maximized, but 
people may feel like they are not ben
efiting as much as others.
He later said in an interview with 
The Tartan that the point of his work 
is to come up with a methodology to 
design computer artifacts that take 
into account the selfish behavior of 
users and are robust in the face of 
such behavior.
Papadimitriou offered the Vickrey 
auction as an example of game 
design that takes selfishness into 
account. In a Vickrey auction, also
known as a second-price sealed bid 
auction, bids are submitted in written 
form with no knowledge of the bids 
of others. The person who bids the 
most is the winner, but the winner 
pays only the second-highest amount 
bid.
If you think for ten seconds, you 
will [decide to] tell the truth, said 
Papadimitriou  that is, bid the 
amount the item is worth to you, 
instead of an inflated or reduced bid, 
which is counter-productive. This 
type of auction links the benefit of 
one to the benefit of all, reducing the 
presence of selfish behavior.
At the end of the lecture, someone 
pointed out that Vickrey auctions do 
not work in eBay, because everyone 
waits until the last second to bid. In 
response, Papadimitriou said, [It] 
makes you question the wisdom of 
computer scientists and the rationali
ty of humanity.
Some pointed out that Vickrey auc
tions do not take into accountall the 
human factors. I think some people 
in the low-price eBay markets fre in it 
for the thrill of the chase, said Mary 
Shaw, a professor of computer sci
ence.
The lecture ended with multiple 
rounds of applause. Its nice to have 
someone here from the area [of game 
theory], said John Dorsey, a doctor
al ECE student whose research con
cerns game theory.
In an interview after the lecture, 
Papadimitriou related his long histo
ry with CMU, which he said he has 
been visiting for 25 years. [It is] one 
of the greatest [CS] departments, 
one of the most active and richplaces 
in CS, he said. I have lots of friends 
here.
Students today do no less homework

twelfth grade from 1948 through 
 1999.
i Their findings disproved the cliche 
that kids today dont work as hard on 
their homework as they did in the 
old days.
According to their study, kids are 
the same today as they were 50 years 
ago.
The results show that ten percent 
of the nations high school students 
spent more than two hours per night 
on homework.
The exception to this trend 
occurred from 1952 to 1962, when 
the Soviets launched Sputnik into 
orbit. Being in the midst of Cold War, 
the American government looked at 
this as defeat, and they pinned the 
blame on the education system.
Their solution was, among other
things, the National Defense 
Education Act (NDEA) of 1951, the 
first large-scale infusion of federal 
money to improve our education sys
tem. Americas educators were 
expected to assign more homework 
in an attempt to match or pass the 
existing workload carried by Soviet 
children.
The proportion of students who 
spent more than two hours per night 
on homework doubled to twenty per
cent.
But as the cultural revolution of 
the late 1960s evolved, students 
attention to homework whittled itself 
back to ten percent, where it remains 
today.
The government tried to again 
spark interest in homework in the 
early 1980s with A Nation at Risk. 
In this report, the government 
showed how American students were
behind their Japanese peers.
American students didnt respond 
to A Nation at Risk as they did to the 
NDEA.
In fact, the only group that showed 
improvement in the amount of time 
spent doing homework were children 
in kindergarten through second 
grade. A 2003 study done by 
Missouri researcher Harris Cooper 
claimed that for children in this age 
group, Homework does not seem to 
matter much for academic achieve
ment.
Schlossman suggests looking at 
homework in terms of its effective
ness as opposed to how much time it 
takes to do it.
Homework is a mountain that 
needs to be moved, he said. If [gov
ernment] continues doing what it has 
been [doing], we arent going to 
change.

ing tool for teaching middle, school

called Panda3D  which was devel
oped by the Walt Bisney

The big improvement over ALICE 
is that you can import animations 
directly from Maya and 3D Studio

Students in the course expressed a 
preference for Panda3D, saying it is 
a more professional program.

Most artists paint about their personal experiences (for how else do we experience the world?), yet I strive to use a new language to describe experi
ence. That is the language of the biological or cellular, or what I coin cellular portraiture. Since we feel our experiences, our bodies record our feelings
 so my question is what does that look like at the cellular level?  wrote Jill Palermo in an e-mail to The Tartan.
The above painting, titled Gateway, is an oil on canvas measuring 78 by 144. Gateway (2003) is part of Palermos current exhibition Out of 
Nothing at Springboard Space on the South Side.
Many of my pieces deal with the concept of threshold, of standing on the precipice of one world, mindset, or emotion, and entering anotherby force, 
by curiosity, or by fate, wrote Palermo. This piece in particular was inspired by a friend I recently met in Arizona. As a white southern woman, she 
worked with MLK Jr. and Maya Angelou on the civil rights movement. She has a stack of degrees and opened up an AIDS hospice in Atlanta before there 
was any tolerance, let alone acceptance of people with the disease. She has spent her entire life being of service to others, in particular brain-injured 
patients. Recently, she found out she has ovarian cancer and was given three months to live. It is within this context I spent the most incredible weekend 
laughing with her, learning from her, and giving her hope about the spirit of people in OUR generation.

Mass. gay marriage ruling 
is a long time in coming
Gays will now have equal footing with their 
heterosexual counterparts in Massachusetts,

against by their government. With marriage, 
uy,'ays will have the legal right to reduced taxes 
Oilirough marriage incentives, access to a part~|V ners health benefits, and most importantly, a

t1 Marriage, one of the oldest social institu
tions, is undergoing a change as American 
society redefines its role in life. The sanctity of 
i ;;jnarriage no longer exists. The new ruling will 
continue to impact the evolution of marriage,
- which continues ever more. With lifeexpectancy ever increasing, it is futile to 
believe that most marriages can span over fifty 
years.

a significant minority of people that are bound

~ ' "legal benefits, there is no rational reason as to

riQr.take center-stage in marriages, having been
limited to designing the wedding dress and 
flower arrangements for too long.
If marriage has been reduced to a fashion 
statement, gays should be entitled to participjate and hopefully illustrate the pinnacle of

Marriage.
With any lesbian couple adopting children, 
society should want to preserve unions in an 
effort to provide stable homes to children. 
Marriages represent a bond, although not nec
essarily physical, that helps to maintain 
unions that may have otherwise dissolved. 
Had Melissa Etheridge and her now-estranged 
lover had the opportunity to marry, Melissas 
children may not have been reduced to partic
ipating in the most bastardized form of family 
life, by visiting their two mommies who live 
next door to each other because no legal 
means exist to arrange custody and visitation 
rights.
Marriage should have been the precursor to 
gay-adoption rights, but with a lax govern
ment, gays have been forced to a lifestyle mir
roring my babys daddy arguments on Jenny 
Jones. The availability of marriage could have 
prevented the formation of the gay stereotype: 
sex-starved and incapable of committing to a 
long-term relationship.
Massachusettss ruling is a step in the right 
direction, although bound to ignite a confla
gration between Americas Alabama-WalMart-shoppers and urban, intellectual metrosexuals. Gay marriage is not an issue that will 
go away if we ignore it.
The federal government needs to take 
proactive steps to legalize gay marriages to 
prevent likely interstate disputes in the 
upcoming homosexual civil war. One thing 
that the country can agree on in this debate  
no tongue-in-cheek sequels to Father of the 
Bride, please.
The unfortunate debauchery that the institution of marriage is suffering in America should 
not be driven by self-righteous, liberal judges with an agenda, such as Massachusetts's Supreme 
Court. One of the dissenting judges was a lesbian who felt that the court overstepped its bounds 
with this ruling. Other judges should consider that dissent before crusading to bypass the legJ1Jlslative body of our government  a body that represents the people, only 32 percent of whom 
' favor gay marriage.
Turkey-day traditions: what 
we are truly thankful for
The Port Authority has broken out the long 
busses for 28X service. Christmas lights line 
> the streets of Shadyside. Turkeys start to trem
ble in fear and prepare to hear less from their 
relatives. Among these, the signs of the 
.approaching holiday, CMU students are 
.preparing to participate in an annual event 
that is uniquely American in nature: 
I^SBianksgiving.
As citizens of this country, we celebrate with 
traditions so long a part of the late-November 
landscape that a year without them would be 
% scrape at our national heritage. For one day 
aL year, a majority of us manage to put aside 
.differences, even sharing a nationally common 
meal, giving thanks to our friends and family 
and whatever higher power we feel deserves 
aliem.
While some of our holidays consistently
- push the envelope of commercialism, nearly to 
the point of suspected Hallmark and florist 
interference, Thanksgiving is never disap- pointing, mostly keeping separate from ecoflomic intrusion. But Thanksgivings effect on 
eapitalism is not to go unnoticed; it always 
-"^allows us a second national holiday: the day
ter.
The day after for many is a day of recovery 
om consumption, ingestion of turkey left
overs, and a most-American beast, the doorbuster sale. Millions of Americans flood the 
malls and mega-stores at unheard of hours in 
the morning to snag extraordinary deals on 
consumer goods.
 J*. And while the gross consumption on 
Thanksgiving afternoons and evenings may 
!!fre gluttonous beyond the reach of many of
the worlds inhabitants, Americans always 
band together, giving food and time, even on 
their days off, to those less fortunate who 
deserve one of our treasured national holi
days just as much. Carnegie Mellon sponsors 
various charitable drives during the preced
ing month; University staff annually gathers 
both non-perishable items and holiday-related foodstuffs for the Greater Pittsburgh Food 
Bank. We support similar charitable contribu
tions from anyone able to do so since they, 
and all Americans, have been irrevocably 
blessed.
For contributing to our shared experience, 
we must also give thanks to Macys depart
ment store in New York City for their produc
tion which entertains us every year on 
Thanksgiving morning by sponsoring hun
dreds of marchers trekking down Broadway, in 
good weather and bad, always followed by 
their ever-growing troupe of comical inflated 
floats; bands from high schools, colleges and 
military organizations; and A1 Roker.
We gather during and after our meals, 
either suffering from or appropriately grati
fied by our tryptophan-filled feast (s) to watch 
as the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys play 
games started as local traditions, but now 
inseparable from the lore of Thanksgivings 
past. Whether we love them or, as is the case of 
most of the east coast, hate the Dallas 
Cowboys, theres something in store for any 
football fan.
We must give thanks especially for 
Thanksgiving, an experience irreplaceable to 
anyone who has ever attempted to seize the 
wishbone.

Republicans Iraqi agenda: election 2004

President George Bush doesnt like news
papers. In a recent interview with Fox News, 
he said, I rarely read the stories, and get 
briefed by people who are probably read the 
news themselves. Bush prefers his news 
from what he calls his most objective 
sources ... people on my staff. Aside from 
the obvious charge that his policy advisers 
are not objective, Bushs recent statements 
show a surprising indifference to reality and 
a very simplistic view of the world. This atti
tude may demonstrate Bushs lacking a 
basic understanding of the world or it may 
exhibit a political attempt to ignore the facts 
and distort the issues in ways favorable to 
his reelection campaign.
During Bushs recent trip to reaffirm 
Americas special relationship with 
Britain, perhaps our closest ally, between 
70,000 and 200,000 people protested the 
war in Iraq. A majority of Britons originally 
supported the war, but many now feel they 
have been misled, and many are scared by 
what they feel is arrogant unilateralism, 
leading 60 percent of Britons in a recent sur
vey to say they consider Bush a threat to 
world peace.
Ignoring claims of deception and the fact 
that many supported the war when they 
believed Bushs claims that Iraq was devel
oping weapons of mass destruction, Bush 
told an interviewer that if he faced protest
ers, hed tell them, I understand you dont 
like war, and neither do I. But I would hope 
you understand that I have learned the 
lessons of September 11,2001, and that ter
rorists declared war on the United States of 
America and war on people that love free
dom.
Ignoring the legitimate arguments of pro
testors and opposition, Bush chose to por
tray the issue in a light that had nothing to 
do with their claims. During his visit, Bush 
largely ignored his opposition, canceling a 
speech in front of the Parliament and spend
ing much time visiting privately with Prime 
Minister Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth.
Then there is Bushs infamous quote in 
response to the growing quagmire in Iraq, 
when he said, The more successful we are 
on the ground, the more these killers will 
react. In other words, the fact that more 
Americans have been killed in under a year 
in Iraq than in the first three years in 
Vietnam indicates that the U.S. is making 
progress because it means the Iraqi insur
gents are becoming desperate.

Parting knowledge: true love knows no labor or loss
umRrgw Jnhmynm
In four and a half years at Carnegie 
Mellon, Ive attended remarkably few class
es, and my interests have changed annually. 
As the rest of the editors and I sit here on 
Sunday, I write my closing remarks about 
my experience at Carnegie Mellon, as this is 
my last paper  I will graduate in 
December. This article breaks a number of 
rules: being written on Sunday, referring to 
The Tartan directly, and being on a topic 
that is not timely. I am at a loss to talk about 
an academic career at CMU, or disclose any 
general revelations I have had. What I have 
consistently been involved in are relation
ships.
My life from 15 to 21 has involved primar
ily three women, with a smattering of trysts 
along the way. I dated one for about 5 years, 
one for forty days, and one since June. I told 
the first girl that I loved her, but I question 
that now as she did then. I told my current 
girlfriend that I do not believe in love. I dont 
even tell most of my family I love them any
more; some I still do because I always have.
I feel a great deal of duty towards friends 
and family, and I am doggedly loyal. Most 
people would tell you these things are a part 
of love. I object to the phrase I love you, 
because we point to couples that differ by 
leaps and bounds, and say they are all in 
love. I love you to me just means We are 
engaging in our unique relationship. Either 
that, or it means that whoever is saying it is 
not engaging fully in the relationship, and is 
using this powerful little phrase to plug the 
holes in a relationship. It also might mean, 
Im still committed, just letting you know.
We are all, to different extents, not per
fectly reliable. Myself, Im a little lazy with 
time, taking after my father. He once suc
cessfully interviewed for a job, but warned 
his prospective employer that he does not do 
nine to five. Upon being asked what he does 
do, my dad said he could be reliably 
expected at work by 10 am, but that 10 am 
meant any time before 10:30 am.
When I would fudge the time on some 
date or errand with my girlfriend of many 
years, I of course told her again and again 
that day that I loved her. In regards to when 
Id lie to her, conceal things from her, or dis
regard her time, Id argue that I did not love 
her, and that we do not always love anyone. 
I think now that it is better to concentrate on 
making your girlfriend always know she is 
loved, rather than remembering to tell her. I 
used to put a lot of stock in the phrase. I did
nt tell my girlfriend I loved her for months. 
If I still liked the phrase, I think that would 
still be my policy.
A good relationship, or love, is made of 
consistency, of days, weeks, months, and 
years of loyalty, of keeping promises, and of 
being open.
I think the good relationships last because 
peoples lives overlap in a pleasing way. 
Anyone who tells you a relationship is hard 
work has never been in a good one. Hard 
work implies that the task at hand is 
unpleasant, or that you dont get out as 
much as you put in. Love does not require so 
much hard work as foresight and patience. 
Good friendships are not hard work, so why 
should good friendships with copious 
amounts of sex be hard work?
My second relationship, with a mentally 
unstable computer science student who 
would graduate 40 days after our first date 
and move to California, would not have last
ed anyways. Its not that I did not like her a 
great deal. I still chat with her via instant 
pestering to this day. When we parted, after 
a relationship we both knew would be fleet
ing, it made us both sad. I reflected on sad 
ideas like the fact that we had met our first 
semester at CMU, but did not have any kind
of friendship until the very end. But as they 
say, we were too different. I think the main 
difference is that she was full of (psychotic) 
passion, and I am extremely dispassionate, 
except about my work sometimes.
I think I scared my current girlfriend 
when I told her I broke off a five-year rela
tionship in 20 minutes. My ex had no idea it 
was coming, because I would lie constantly 
to her.
Ive averaged well under a 3.0 throughout 
my CMU career. I couldnt tell you a good 
method to pick up a girl. But there are a few 
truths I think Ive learned about what hap
pens once you actually do get the girl. I cant 
comment on womens views, or the gay view 
of relationships.
One is that without lies, there is no work 
and no pain, though there may be quick 
break-ups.
Good relationships involve people who 
like each other more than they like most 
other people.
If you are a considerate guy, there are 
women out there who will reward you for 
this. If youre half asshole and half jerk like 
me, then there are women who will put up 
with you.
Good relationships do not have to include 
lots of time on the telephone.
Good sex is learned from books, and lots 
and lots of practice.
The only way you can know if a relation
ship is going well is if you are happy a lot.
Marriage is for children, because people 
shouldnt lock themselves in when an easy 
parting may be a better idea as people 
change.
And from looking back on this final col
umn, I conclude that I know remarkably lit
tle about love.

GOP deceptive 
about Iraq, 
election hopes
BUSH, from page A7
Iraqi insurgents hate freedom: 
Never mind the fact that while many 
Iraqis appreciate the oustingnof 
Saddam Hussein, they wish the 
United States would let them manage 
their own country and see the United 
States as reluctant to cede controLln 
fact, leading architects of Bushs Iraq 
policies originally didnt intend to 
cede control quickly. rAr1
According to a Knight-Ridder arti
cle, Richard Perle and other top advi
sors for Bush had wished to install 
Ahmed Chalabi as leader of Iraq. 
Chalabi was leader of the Central 
Intelligence Agency-backed Iraqi 
National Congress, supplied much 
intelligence on Iraqs weapons pre
grams to them, and told tfifoe 
Washington Post that American com
panies will have a big shot at Iraqi 
oil. Bushs Iraq policy team supports 
Chalabi despite the facts that make 
many in the CIA and State 
Department wary, including that<iie 
has been sentenced to 22 years in jail 
in Jordan after being convicted of 
charges including embezzlement 
from a bank he managed, and that he 
is unpopular in Iraq. Many political 
pundits attribute the lack of planning 
for post-war Iraq to Bushs most 
objective sources believing that they 
could easily install Chalabi as leader.
Some people might believe the rel
atively innocent explanation that 
Bush simply doesnt understand the 
world very well. After all, his news 
comes in filtered by advisors who are 
close with radical groups such as the 
Project for the New American 
Century, which wants to use 
American power to drastically 
reshape the world. This explanation 
could be right. According to a recent 
New York Times article, George Bush 
had a puzzled look on his face after 
meeting with moderate Islamic lead
ers in Indonesia, asking his advisors if 
they really believe that we think al} 
Muslims are terrorists? The article 
said that Mr. Bushs aides concede 
that Mr. Bush has only begun to dis 
cover the gap between the picture of a 
benign superpower that he sees, and 
the far more calculating, self-interest) 
ed, anti-Muslim America the worlcj 
perceives as he speeds by behind dark 
windows. On the other hand, it 
could be that Bush is using Orwellian 
doublespeak in order to reframe the 
issues as a choice between extremes. 
Perhaps he wants voters to choose 
between good and evil in 2004, good 
being the Republicans and evil being 
the Democrats.
Indeed, there is evidence of this in 
an obscene ad that Republicans am 
starting to broadcast in Iowa feliaS 
exploits the fears of a post-SeptemBef
11 world, and Im not referring to th 
2002 ad that accused a Democratic 
senator who lost three limbs in 
Vietnam of being unpatriotic. This 
new ad is absurdly claiming that 
Democrats are attacking the 
President for attacking terrorists.1 
Democrats are just as patriotic a$ 
Republicans; the former simply thinly 
the U.S. should focus on destroying 
al-Qaeda rather than getting he? 
army entangled in a quagmire that 
dops not help national security. One 
would hope that George Bush soon 
realizes or acknowledges that ther 
are people who are against terrorises 
but who disagree with the specifics^ 
U.S. foreign policy.

President Bush will indeed pardon two turkeys 
this week for Thanksgiving, as it has become a tra
dition for Presidents of the United States to do. 
Following another tradition, he will then sit down 
with his family to a Thanksgiving meal which will, 
undoubtedly, include turkey.
While there is perhaps nothing more American 
than apple pie, the tradition of eating turkey on 
Thanksgiving must be close. To deny this most 
basic of practices is to deny those people who first 
celebrated and gave thanks so many years ago; it 
is to deny who we are as Americans.
The concerns given by PETA showcase that 
organizations tendency: highlighting the very 
worst examples available in the world. In any case, 
the conditions to which animals are subjected are 
an undeniable consequence of our capitalist econ
omy: the relatively short life spans of these birds 
make it desirable to maximize output per unit area 
of farm space.
Mass commercial farming of turkeys lowers 
their cost so that all of us can more easily enjoy 
this tradition. The relatively low price of turkey 
means that even the destitute will be able to share
in the traditional Thanksgiving celebration.
To call turkey less than nutritious may be slight
ly misguided. A full turkey leg makes much more 
than one serving, and it includes a large amount 
of skin. For the true nutritional value of turkey, 
consider the following figures from the United 
States Department of Agriculture.
The skin of a turkey contains three times as 
many calories and eleven times as much fat per 
ounce as the white meat portion; if one eats only 
the meat, turkey becomes one of the most nutri
tious food choices available.
Turkey is full of iron, zinc, phosphorus, potassi
um, and B-vitamins. White turkey meat takes 75 
percent of its calories from protein, not fat. While 
a serving does have more than 70 mg of choles
terol, this isnt exactly a large amount: for a serv
ing of meat, its quite low compared to, say, beef. 
In a rather low 2000-calorie diet, thats only onequarter of the USDA recommended daily 
allowance.
Besides, turkey is chock-full of amino acids like 
tryptophan, which acts as a precursor to serotonin 
and provides that nice full satisfied feeling to 
which weve all become accustomed on 
Thanksgiving evening.
All humans  including those who dont con
sume turkey  are prone to health troubles, 
including heart disease, cancer, strokes, and dia
betes. Vegetarians, in particular, are also prone to
problems stemming from malnutrition and defi
ciencies in vitamin B-12 along with iron and zinc.
While pumping food full of antibiotics is never a 
good idea, we can all agree that a living turkey is 
better than a sick and dying turkey.
Speaking of bacteria, they occur in meat just 
like anything that has a tendency to crowd around 
sources of energy. Most meats, and for that mat
ter, many of the foods that we all eat will have 
potentially harmful bacteria in them. This is why 
we cook meat.
The popularity of free-range birds  most of 
whose conditions arent nearly as bad as UPC 
would make them out to be  suggests that the 
industry responds to public pressure about the 
treatment of the birds and in the end deliver what 
the consumer demands. This demand, as it would 
seem, is for turkey.
This Thanksgiving, I will be giving thanks to 
God for family, friends, health, life, and many 
other things. I will also be eating one of the 
44,999,998 turkeys that havent been spared.
After all, if we werent meant to eat turkey, then 
why is it so tasty?

President Bush will officially pardon two 
turkeys this week for Thanksgiving. About 45 mil
lion others wont be so fortunate. Americans cele
brate gratitude, family, and other righteous values 
on Thanksgiving. As victims of nefarious factoryfarming, turkeys have nothing to be thankful for. 
Thanksgivings centerpiece-of-attention contra
dicts the positive values associated with the holi
day.
Turkeys cant stand their abhorrent conditions 
because they cant stand or move at all. Factoryfarmed turkeys live in cages so tiny that they can
not even stretch or flap a wing. Most do not have 
more than three-and-a-half square feet of space, 
according to People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals (PETA).
Additionally, factory-farmed turkeys are fed 
excessive growth hormones and antibiotics, and 
are bred, such that they quickly gain weight. 
These birds are so top-heavy that their bones and 
leg muscles often cant support their bodies. As 
the animal rights group United Poultry Concerns 
(UPC) noted, they are doubly imprisoned, in 
unnatural bodies and confined living quarters.
Factory-farms remove turkeys beaks and ampu
tate their toes. This reduces the damage that peck
ing and scratching would otherwise cause in an 
overcrowded environment. These procedures are 
performed without anesthetics. According to UPC, 
sensitive beak tissue suffers lifelong pain after
debeaking and resembles human phantom limb 
and stump pain.
Artificial insemination is the most obscene, 
unnatural process for factory-farmed turkeys. The 
birds are so obese and deformed that they cant 
mate naturally. Phallus manipulating teams, 
according to UPC, milk male turkeys. Operators 
then insert the semen in a hens vagina with a 
hypodermic syringe or by breath pressure down a 
tube.
Factory-farmed turkeys grow up motherless. 
UPC says that in nature, young turkeys stay with 
their mothers for up to five months. Factoryfarmed turkeys live for less than that time-span. 
Like the rest of factory-farming conditions, this 
aspect of their lives is completely warped.
Unsurprisingly, factory-farmed turkeys suffer 
myriads of diseases. Artificial insemination often 
results in fowl cholera. Many birds experience 
starve-out, according to PETA, in which they 
dont eat because of stress incurred from 
debeaking and transportation. Their gigantic size 
causes swollen joints, crippled feet, and heart 
attacks.
Humans who consume turkey are also prone to  
health troubles, such as heart disease, cancer, 
strokes, and diabetes. Food poisoning is also a crit
ical concern; the Institute for Agriculture and 
Trade Policy and the Sierra Club found last year 
that 45 percent of ground turkey contains salmo
nella bacteria.
Turkey isn't the most nutritious of dining 
options  it lacks fiber and is high in cholesterol 
and fat. A turkey leg has 72 mg of cholesterol and 
roughly half of its calories come from fat, accord
ing to PETA. That's more than many cuts of beef!
Slaughter comprises a brief concluding chapter 
in the life of a turkey, but its an abominable 
process nevertheless. At the slaughterhouse, 
workers suspend turkeys upside-down by their 
weak legs. Their heads pass through a stunning 
tank which renders them immobile, but not 
unconscious. Many birds dodge the tank, such 
that they are fully alert when their throats are slit. 
If the automated knife doesnt kill the birds, they 
will be boiled alive in scalding water intended to 
remove corpses feathers.
Some consumers reject factory-farming condi
tions, and instead choose free-range birds. The 
Associated Press wrote last week that some freerange turkeys have plenty of room to roam and 
socialize. This freedom is by no means the norm.
To be USDA-certified as free-range, birds simply 
require access to the outdoors.
No other criteria, such as environmental quali
ty, size of area, number of birds, or space per bird, 
are included in this term, explained UPC.
Factory-farmed animals, and most of their freerange counterparts, suffer unjustifiable cruelties. 
Agribusiness inflicts this suffering because it sees 
livestock as economic tools of production rather 
than feeling beings. Free-range meat and poultry 
are not much of a superior alternative.
Compassion is left to the general public. The 
consumer must eschew factory-farming, pardon 
the turkeys, and give thanks in a vegetarian, cru
elty-free way.

ticularly against the run, and a great 
coach who has proven he can lead 
them to a championship. Their 
offense is suspect, however, and will 
be their Achilles heel come playoff 
time. I think the Patriots will make 
the playoffs, even if Miami steals the 
division, and I also think they will 
advance past the first round. 
However, they are not a Super Bowl 
team this year, not with the other 
jiowerhouses throughout the confer,rente.
AFC West: Speaking of power
houses, lets move to the division 
-containing the mighty Chiefs whose 
might was questioned following a 
loss to the revitalized Bengals last 
week. There is no doubt in my mind 
that the Chiefs will win this division, 
but they could use a win at Denver 
W prove they are a legitimate Super 
-Bowl contender. Denver is the sec
ond-best team in this group, but only 
if Jake Plummer can stay healthy for 
the rest of the year. Not having a 
decent quarterback has hurt the. 
Broncos in a couple games this sea
son (a last-second loss to New 
England didnt help either), but this
team is dangerous with Plummer 
and Portis running the show. 
Oakland and San Diego both suck 
this year, but both could play spoiler 
for Denvers wild-card hopes (partic
ularly if Flutie starts to work his old 
magic for the Chargers). I think that 
Denver will not make the playoffs; 
the wild-card spots should go to the 
second-place finisher in the East and 
South divisions. Once the Broncos 
get a full season out of Plummer, 
however, they will be a playoff team.
I conclude this semester with my 
playoff and Super Bowl picks, as the 
next time you hear from me, the 
postseason will be in full swing.
From the NFC, I pick the Eagles, 
Packers, Panthers, Rams, 49ers, and 
Vikings; and in the AFC it will be the 
Ravens, Colts, Patriots, Chiefs,

Bowl will feature the surprise 
Panthers and the get-the-monkeyoff-Paytons-back Colts, with 
Carolina winning.

Same teams, 
new leader in 
AFC playoffs
Colin Holloway
It is late November, and that can 
only mean one thing is around the 
corner: finals. That is right, my 
friends, as we pump ourselves full of 
coffee and knowledge in preparation 
for the next couple of weeks, the 
NFL is heating up. Playoff hopes are 
on the line now, and every game 
matters for teams who want a shot at 
the Super Bowl.
The last of the unbeaten teams fell 
last week, the Titans continued to 
roll along, the Colts bounced back, 
and the Bengals found themselves in 
first place for the first time in over a 
decade. With that said, I take a look 
at the AFC:
AFC North: Perhaps the weakest 
division in football, the AFC North 
has provided us with some of the 
biggest surprises of the season. To 
begin with, no one in this division is 
all that good, and had either the 
Bengals or Ravens (who share the 
lead at 5-5) been in any other 
grouping neither would make the 
playoffs. As it is, they both stand a 
chance. Marvin Lewis has proven 
himself worthy of the head coaching 
job he has fought for over these last 
couple of years. Even though they 
had an impressive win over the ex
undefeated Chiefs last week, I am 
still not sold on the Bengals. I dont 
think theyll make the playoffs; that 
honor should go to the Ravens from 
this division. Baltimore has the bet
ter defense, and a strong running 
attack that can dominate football 
games. The loss of rookie QB Kyle 
Boiler will hurt them, but Baltimore 
should hang on to this division. 
Pittsburgh continues to falter, failing 
to build any momentum that would 
spark a midseason turnaround; how
ever, this division could be won with 
an 8-8 record, so no team is out of it. 
Clevelands offense scored big last 
week, and the Browns are closer to 
the top than Pittsburgh. If Cleveland 
can find their offense consistently, it 
isnt too late for them to come from 
one game back to take this division.
AFC South: This division contains 
two of the best teams in the league 
in the Colts and Titans, matched 
with two of the young, up-and-coming-but-still-bad-teams in the 
Jaguars and the Texans. That said, 
this year Jacksonville and Houston 
have no chance, though they might 
if they were in the AFC North; how
ever, they both have good young QBs 
and will be a force over the next few 
years. This year, the battle for the 
top is as intense as any in the NFL. 
Steve McNair is having an MVP sea
son, and Peyton Manning is finally 
winning some big games in Indy.
Both defenses have proven them
selves this year, and once again 
offense is not a concern for either 
team. Marvin Harrison could deter
mine this division; if he can come 
back 100 percent, then the Colts 
should be able to hold out. However, 
without him, I dont think 
Indianapolis can beat Tennessee 
again. McNair is a gutsy QB, but 
there is only so much he can do 
against a better Colts team. The 
Colts already won the head-to-head 
match-up in Indy, and (unlike past 
Colts teams) have proven themselves 
in must-win games. I think whoever 
comes out ahead has a legitimate 
shot at the Super Bowl, and I pick 
the Colts.
AFC East: An historically hardfought division, this one is not pro
ducing the close races it has in the 
past couple of years. New England is 
finding ways to win football games, 
and has taken some control over the 
division. Both the Bills and Jets lost 
too much in the beginning half of 
the season to mount any successful 
comeback, and the Dolphins cant 
seem to get anything rolling.
Because of good competition from 
the AFC South and West, the winner 
of this division may be the only one 
to make the playoffs. The Dolphins 
tend to choke in December when 
they are in the lead, so going into 
the later months, in second place 
doesnt bode well for them.
However, dont count them out.
Ricky Williams is still the most tal
ented back in the NFL, even if he 
doesnt have the necessary support. 
Brian Griese, for all his bad games, 
can produce great games on occa
sion, and the Dolphins defense is 
among the better units in the NFL. If 
this team gets rolling, they can move 
past New England and steal this divi
sion. The Patriots ruined Miamis 
season last year, and you can bet the 
Fish have not forgotten and are look
ing for revenge. However, the 
Patriots are in the drivers seat right 
now. They have a great defense, parMens team off to first 2-0 start since 1996
Tartans defeat Grove City, Washington & Jefferson with strong second half performances; Kaitz named MVP, Divens named to all-tournament team
by Daniel Ceppos
Staffwriter
The mens basketball team started 
the season off on the right foot this 
weekend, winning their first two 
games by large margins against the 
Grove City Wolverines and the 
Washington and Jefferson 
Presidents. Carnegie Mellon co-hosted the West Penn Classic, which fea
tured Grove City, Washington and 
Jefferson, and Allegheny, and was 
the only team to leave the weekend 
undefeated, a feat not accomplished 
by CMU since 1996.
The Tartans played at Grove City 
on Friday night in the premier 8 pm 
game. Foul trouble dictated play in 
the first half for Carnegie Mellon. 
With eleven minutes remaining, the 
Wolverines were already in the dou
ble bonus. Despite controlling play 
for the most part, Grove City failed to 
penetrate the tight Tartan defense 
and convert on scoring opportuni
ties. Their favorable calls from the 
referees led them to lead only 34-30 
at the half.
In the second half, however, the 
Tartans were a new team. Fueled by 
determination, they came together 
and capitalized on Grove Citys early

Head coach Tony Wingen entered his fourteenth season with CMU Friday night.
missed chances to take control of the 
game. Five minutes into the half, 
Carnegie Mellon took the lead and 
never looked back, forcing an 
impressive 22 turnovers and outscoring the Wolverines 49-28 in the half. 
The Tartans also grabbed more 
rebounds than Grove City, a team 
previously recognized for their 
rebounding skills. An all-around 
strong team performance was led by 
senior forward Matt Kaitz, who had
14 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists. 
Junior forward Michael Divens also 
contributed to the effort by leading 
the team with 15 points and 9 
rebounds, and sophomore guard A. J. 
Straub added 13 points.
The final score was 79-62, as 
Carnegie Mellon defeated Grove City 
for the first time in seven years.
On Saturday night, in the homeopener before a supportive crowd, 
the Tartans defeated Washington 
and Jefferson at Skibo Gymnasium. 
Much like the night before, Carnegie 
Mellon played poorly in the first half, 
and the Presidents led by as much as
11 points. However, with eight min
utes remaining in the half, Carnegie 
Mellon put together an 8-0 run and 
cut Washington and Jeffersons lead 
to 2, leaving the halftime score 
33-31.
The Tartans continued their strong 
play into the second half. After a 
quick 3-point bucket from President 
guard Michael Chicone, Carnegie 
Mellon went on a 13-0 run,' capped 
off by a pair of Straub three-pointers, 
and took a commanding lead. 
Washington and Jefferson cut the 
lead to 2 at one point, but the 
Tartans were too much for the 
Presidents and scored 20 points in 
seven minutes to ensure victory by a 
score of 86-60. Kaitz and Straub, 
each scored 17 points to lead the 
team in the winning effort.
Head coach Tony Wingen 
described the Tartans early victories 
as the product of a good work ethic 
in practice.
We had an excellent preseason, 
said Wingen. All the hard work the 
team put in really came to fruition 
this weekend. [The coaching staff] 
told the guys all preseason to contin
ue to stay with our style of play and 
we will just wear our opponents 
down, which is exactly what hap
pened this weekend.

First-year center Greg Gonzalez (left) has made an immediate impact for CMU.
Kaitz earned Most Valuable Player 
recognition for the West Penn Classic 
and is looking forward to a season 
filled with success for Carnegie 
Mellon.
If we continue to play like we did 
in both games, were in very good 
shape, said Kaitz, the teams cap
tain. I like the way we look. We had 
a very good start to the season.
Divens, who was also honored by 
being named to the West Penn 
Classic All-Tournament Team, was 
wary of speaking too soon about the 
teams future success, but looks for
ward to intra-conference competi
tion.
These teams were a good test, but 
we will compete against far better 
teams in our conference. However, if 
we can stay consistently strong like 
in the second halves of both games 
[this weekend], then were set to 
have an exciting season, said 
Divens.
The next game will be played 
against Kenyon on Saturday, 
November 29 at 3 pm, when 
Carnegie Mellon hosts the annual 
Ramada Plaza Suites Tournament.
I strongly encourage anyone to 
come and watch our team play, said 
Wingen. Were ready to have an 
excellent season.

The Tartan womens basketball 
team opened their 2003-04 season 
in a four-team tournament at 
Capital University in Ohio on Friday 
with questions regarding the soli
darity of their team following the 
graduation of three of last year's 
starters.
Also missing this year is last 
years leading scorer, Carissa Sain, 
who will be redshirted this season 
following a preseason ankle injury. 
Sain will return to play as a fifthyear senior next season.
Senior guard Danyelle Sinclair 
returns this year to anchor a new set 
of starters with the common goal of 
improving on last years 12-13 
record.
Joining Sinclair in the backcourt 
are junior forward Lisa Seacat and 
sophomore guard Ashley 
Mazziotta; starting in the front 
court are senior center Elizabeth 
Painter and sophomore 
forward/center Rebecca Shore.
Sinclair, effectively the only 
returning starter, is optimistic about 
the teams chances this year in spite 
of their relative inexperience.
I think we have a lot of growing 
to do.... We do have a very young 
team, she said.
The weekends tournament 
opened with CMU against Alma 
College and home team Capital fac
ing Bethany College. The Tartans 
game against Alma started with a 
strong showing from Almas 
Fighting Scots, who held a com
manding lead of 22-10 after 10 
minutes. During the remainder of 
the first half, however, the Tartans 
prevented Alma from increasing 
their lead over 12. Early scoring 
runs in the second half twice 
brought Carnegie Mellon into strik
ing distance of taking the lead, but 
each time Alma managed to pull 
away to hang on for their first victo
ry of the season, 62-53. Sain, play
ing in her only game of the season, 
and Seacat each led the team with
dMMcn 
8pS5 OdsO4
12 points.
I made the decision on Monday 
... that I wanted to give it a shot, 
Sain said, after playing 30 minutes 
in Fridays game. But the post-game 
condition of her ankle after two 
months in a cast combined with the 
foreknowledge that she will be 
remaining at Carnegie Mellon for 
next season prompted her decision 
to forgo a year of eligibility this sea
son.
In the other Friday game, homecourt advantage was insufficient for 
Capital to overtake Bethany, which 
seems poised to improve on last sea
sons PAC standing. The Bison won 
the game 68-64.
Saturday afternoons contest fea
tured the Tartans and Capital in the 
consolation game of the tourna
ment. Even without their leading 
scorer, the Tartans jumped out to an 
early six-point lead, but the 
Crusaders managed to mount a 
24-4 run to give them a comfort
able 14-point lead 10 minutes into 
the half.
By halftime, Capitals lead was an 
apparently insurmountable 21 
points. Despite an outstanding con
tribution by Shore with 14 points 
and 14 boards in the game, 
Carnegie Mellon did not shave 
much off Capitals lead during the 
second half. The Crusaders took the 
contest 69-54.
Sinclair, who tied Shore with the 
team-high 14 points, expects 
improvement from the team in the 
coming games.
I think 0-2 now will make us 
want to get our first win and play 
harder to get it.
Saturdays championship game 
pitted Bethany against Alma. The 
contest was dominated by Scots 
senior forward Karen Hall who 
scored 10 of her game-high 28 
points in overtime as Alma won the 
game 77-72 to take the tournament 
title.
The Tartans (0-2) next take the 
court at La Roche College Saturday 
before opening their home season 
against Grove City on December 2 
at 7 pm.
Swimming teams split at Case
by Colin Holloway
Staffwriter
Over the course of this fall season, 
the mens varsity swim team has 
rocketed itself to a quick start that 
saw several national cuts by junior 
Brian McCarthy and sophomore 
Chris Pearson and strong perfor
mances by the rest of the squad. 
Proving itself to be filled not only 
with talent, but also with depth, they 
have built on their fourth-place 
national finish of a year ago, and 
started a run towards a better rank
ing at the national tournament this 
coming March.
On the womens side there has 
been constant improvement. Going 
up against top national competitors 
in every meet, the CMU women have 
made their mark as an improving 
team who will not quit against even 
the most difficult competition. Both 
teams have displayed depth and 
improvement, particularly among 
the first-years who have acclimated 
well to collegiate swimming. This 
past weekend the season-long trends 
continued against Case Western 
Reserve, with the team splitting the 
results.
The mens team once again came 
away with a victory, as the women 
again swam well in defeat against 
their nationally-ranked opponent.
The meet went really well, said 
senior co-captain Brian Belowich. It 
was the seniors final dual away 
meet, and were happy with the 
results. We saw a good performance 
from everybody this weekend, David 
Krzemenski, a first-year, won his 
event; the team as a whole did really
well. Senior Brian McCarthy echoed 
this sense of satisfaction, It has been 
a good year so far for us, and it was 
nice to continue our success this 
weekend. Weve seen everyone con
tribute all year long, and we saw it 
again this weekend. We just have to 
keep this up.
Keeping it up is something the 
team has excelled at all year, regard
less of the ease with which they win.
Even though most of the meet 
scores have been in our favor this 
year, our team continues to keep 
doing their best in every meet, said 
coach Dave Belowich, Im very 
pleased with the way the guys are 
swimming right now.
As the guys.continued to roll, the 
women suffered a tough last-event 
defeat against a difficult Case 
Western team. The final event of the 
meet, the 200-yard freestyle relay, 
was the event that would decide the 
meet, and the CMU women won by 
close to 3 or 4 seconds. However, one 
of the judges called a foul for one 
swimmer leaving the block before 
she had touched the wall. As a result 
both CMU teams were disqualified 
from the event, and Case Western 
took the points and the meet.
It was a judgment call, said 
coach Belowich. The official made 
that call and DQed both our relays. 
We were disappointed, but it doesnt 
take away from how well the girls 
swam. They fought for every event. 
Despite the defeat, the women 
continued to show signs of improve
ment, particularly among ihe 
younger swimmers. Every first-year 
swimmer has swum a personal best 
time this season. The high level of 
competition that the lady-swimmers
face on a regular basis has thus led to 
an increased effort and better results 
each time out. With constant 
improvement the team has matched 
their male counterparts if not in 
meet success, then in effort and per
sonal best performances. Against 
Case Western, first-year Emily 
Rhodes swam a lifetime best in the 
1000-yard freestyle and the 500-yard 
with times of 11:55.83 and 5:54.47, 
respectively, while first-year Jennifer 
Sieger also swam a lifetime best in 
the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 
:56.37.
The first-years were not the only 
members of the women's team that 
put up personal bests, however. 
Junior Samantha Monda swam a life
time best with a 1:02.02 in the 100- 
yard butterfly, while junior Kate 
Riche finished the 100-yard back
stroke in a season-best 1:04.76, and 
junior Jennifer Wong finished sec
ond in the 500-yard freestyle with a 
season-best time of 5:20.73.
As the teams look forward to the 
remainder of the fall and beginning 
of the spring season, they can look 
back on a start that has seen not only 
amazing' individual performances, 
but consistent team effort and 
improvement as well. In a semester 
that welcomed several new firstyears, and saw participation and 
leadership from upperclassmen on 
both teams, the varsity swim team 
has come together to improve their 
performance and their national rank
ing. They finish up their semester 
with meets at Miami of Ohio and 
Grove City in early December before 
starting their winter training session 
in early January to prepare for the 
spring half of their season.

Academic pageantry
Miss Pittsburgh vies for Miss PA  and writes a thesis about it
This years Miss Pittsburgh goes to Carnegie 
Mellon. After senior anthropology and interna
tional relations major Jennie Schweitzer heads 
to the Miss Pennsylvania pageant this coming 
weekend, she will turn her experience at the 
pageant into a thesis that combines historical 
analysis and ethnography.
Under the guidance of her research advisor, 
professor Judith Modell, Schweitzer is writing 
her thesis paper using inside knowledge to 
enhance her research on the topic of beauty 
pageants.
The inside world of beauty pageants is not 
one that is seen by many people and through 
this experience I hope to get a glance at what 
beauty queens and beauty pageants are really 
like, she said. She is investigating what she 
calls the culture of beauty.
Shes a little surprised that shes involved in 
something like this because she didnt set out to 
do it. It just kind of found her, said her moth
er, Lorraine Panikoski. According to Panikoski, 
Schweitzer has had only one other pageant 
experience, back in high school. She competed 
in the local VFW pageant, making runner-up 
first time and later ending up winner of the dis
trict.
Panikoski said that Schweitzer did it for her 
grandfather; when they were girls, Panikoski 
and her sisters never wanted to participate in 
the pageant despite her fathers wishes. 
Schweitzer did it to make her grandfather 
happy, but ended up having fun, said her moth
er.
If she wins the statewide pageant at the air
port Marriott hotel this weekend, Schweitzer 
will represent the state of Pennsylvania in the 
Miss USA pageant. Though she hopes for the 
best, she doesnt expect to win.
My goal is to make it to the final ten, she 
said.
Lasting three days, the Miss Pennsylvania 
USA pageant includes four major events: swim
suit, evening gown, interview, and the final 
crowning. Panikoski expects Schweitzer to do 
best in the interview section.
Shell show up well when she interviews, 
she said. She comes across as caring, as bright, 
as articulate. I think thats what shell do best 
in.
The most important thing to Schweitzer has 
been the experience of competing.
Win or lose, I do not believe the pageant has 
really changed my goals for the future. My life 
goal is to become an attorney. I do not believe 
having a crown would make this goal any hard
er or easier, said Schweitzer.
Its good for her; its good for her self
esteem, said Panikoski. This is more fun and 
more of a diversion and more of something she 
never thought shed do. Shell give it her best.
Schweitzers family hasnt been involved in 
much of the pageant. Schweitzer made the 
decision to participate in the pageant herself, 
but asked her mother for her opinion.
Shes very independent and does a lot of 
stuff on her own.... She decides she wants to 
do something and she does it, said Panikoski.
Panikoski is flying up from Florida on 
Saturday night to see the last day of the pag
eant, but wont see most of the competition, 
due to having a busy family and work schedule.
Shes not going to do this ever again  
unless she wins, which would be nice, she 
said.
If the Miss Pennsylvania USA pageant is'real
ly looking for the most well-rounded young 
woman in Pennsylvania, Schweitzers many 
interests could give her a good shot at the 
crown.
She likes to see herself as someone who 
cares about learning a lot, said Panikoski. She 
always has, she always likes to learn things. I 
think education is more important to her.... 
Shes not a beauty queen, shes a pretty girl.

cmu.meat.market
A new campus bboard for singles is becoming a forum for more than dating
At Carnegie Mellon, bboards devoted to different 
topics have taken on a life of their own; now, theres 
one that can help students find that special someone. 
cmu.misc.singles gives students an opportunity to 
meet other CMU people, as opposed to using an 
[internet matching service], said founder Johnny 
Lee.
Lee, a third-year Human-Computer Interaction PhD 
student, started by placing a personals ad on 
cmu.misc.market a month ago. Lee does not actively 
post on bboards, but since he had posted on 
misc.market a few times before, he decided to place 
his ad just for the hell of it on a quiet weekend.
I received about ten to twelve e-mails from guys 
saying what a good idea it was, Lee said. As a result 
of the positive responses, Lee decided that a matching 
system for Carnegie Mellon singles would be a good 
idea. Many students, especially the older ones, feel
pressure to pair off, he said; Lee sometimes feels that 
pressure himself.
My view about the CMU dating scene is probably 
different from most undergrads, Lee said. As a PhD 
student, Lee rarely meets people outside of his office. 
Most of his office mates are either married or in long
term relationships. Im the only single person I know, 
and that makes things a little hard. When he began 
his PhD program at Carnegie Mellon, it was [my 
hope] that something like this would have actually 
existed before, he said.
Unfortunately, cmu.misc.singles has not yet been 
actively used for its main purpose. Most of the posts 
so far have been comments on the few ads placed on 
the bboard, and Lees efforts to remind the users of a 
polite code of conduct have also provoked some criti
cism on the bboard. This is the sort of culture present 
on misc.market, Lee said. Any time there is some
thing to argue about, people will leap on it. Since 
cmu.misc.singles is a loose spin-off of misc.market, a 
lot of people assume that the same culture applies 
here, Lee explained. However, I dont feel like its 
appropriate for this board at all.
Fifth-year chemistry major Jacqueline Cipa did not 
see arguments on the bboard as a problem. Flame 
wars are a lot of fun, she said. Its probably the only 
time students are almost completely uninhibited in 
expressing their opinions on controversial issues.
Cipa sees the bboard as a welcome new develop
ment. Since the bboard is exclusive to members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community, it is likely to have the 
benefits of dating websites, without some of the has
sles, said Biba.
Anyone who responds is likely to be rather intelli
gent, and theres a good chance the two of you know 
at least one person in common, she said. Plus, they 
can probably relate to your life much more easily than 
people from outside CMU.
Even though cmu.misc.singles has not yet been 
crowded with ads, it has gotten some positive 
responses from those who were familiar with it.
Id be disappointed to see the bboard empty, Lee 
said. My hope is that the bboard will take off, and 
people will use it for what they are supposed to.
Any bboard needs a critical mass for it to take off, 
Lee explained.

Finding the Center
There are a whole slug of sitting groups, she said, 
but Deep Spring is the only temple in the area with a 
resident priest. Roberts runs the center with the help of 
several lay practitioners and encourages anybody with 
interest to attend an introductory evening. Amongst 
local colleges, much of the interest comes from com
parative religion classes; several colleges visit the cen
ter regularly, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania 
has a regular overnight retreat, said Roberts.
Munnich studied Zen under many leaders and in 
many places. From 1975 until 1990, she studied under 
the late Dainin Katigiri-Roshi in Minnesota; she has 
since studied in California and Japan and is currendy 
the Head Priest at the Zen Center of Asheville, N.C.
A common misconception about meditation is that inAnnalisa Schaefer/Copy Staffr
Reverend Teijo Munnich introduces campus to Pittsburghs Zen community
[Munnich] has, for 30 years, been working on a 
womens practice center, said Roberts, and in the next 
year Munnich hopes to open the Great Tree Temple,-a 
place where practitioners can discover the spirituality 
of the feminine. The lecture was a stop on Munnichs 
fundraising tour for the temple. During the lecture, 
Munnich discussed the difficulty of reconciling knowl
edge with experience. According to her, the problem 
with truth is that humans like to think of it as some
thing they can get  something constant and attain
able. When one sits down quietly, the realization comes 
that everything is constantly changing, that one cant 
hold on to something that continues to change, she 
said.
Silence can be hard to find in college: the stress of 
classes and work creates an environment that is some
times far from serene. But for an hour on Friday, medi
tative quiet filled McConomy Auditorium as Reverend 
Teijo Munnich lectured on Zen meditation. The lecture, 
titled What is the Sound of Sitting Meditation: Zen 
and Experience, was sponsored by the office of the 
Vice Provost for Education, Indira Nair, and attracted a 
diverse crowd of students and other locals.
There has been a long tradition of studying the 
mind, said psychology professor Patricia Carpenter, 
who organized the lecture. This tradition extends to 
both the world of psychology and the world of spiritu
ality. When Carpenter learned that Munnich, a wellx 
known and respected American Zen teacher, would be 
in Pittsburgh, she asked Nair to sponsor a visit to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Munnich was visiting the Zen Center of Pittsburgh at 
the Deep Spring Temple in Sewickley. The head priest 
there, Reverend Kyoki Roberts, gave some insight into 
Zen and the local area. She said that while local groups 
of immigrants have been following Zen Buddhism as 
their native practice for generations, it is only in the last 
fifty years that there has been an increase in general 
interest in Zen in the United States.
order to succeed, it is necessary to stop thinking. 
Cessation of thought is impossible; it is more a matter of 
clearing the mind of too many thoughts.
Thoughts are secretions of the brain. If our stomachs 
secrete too much gastric juice, we get sick, said 
Munnich. If our brains secrete too many thoughts, we 
get sick as well. In Munnichs view, there are two 
major perspectives on reality.. The ultimate is that 
nothing exists in a permanent and independent state. 
The absolute comes from a broader view of reality 
that comes from just experiencing life, from just sitting 
down and shutting up. Any given group of people who 
sit in a room create a new possibility, a new combina
tion. The sound of these people sitting quietly is some
thing that can only be experienced; to talk about what 
it might be is useless. This is one of Munnichs reasons 
for wanting to create a Zen center for women; it would 
be the only way to discover the sound of women sitting 
quietly, she said.
The point of meditation, said Munnich, is to have an 
experience. When someone claims that he or she has
failed in meditation because his or her mind was too 
busy, that person has experienced the awareness of 
what is happening in his or her mind. Just that aware
ness is enough to be awakened.
Such a realization is very valuable to Munnich. As 
such, for a college student buried under a load of work, 
her suggestion is rather simple: Sit down and shut up 
for a bit.
The Zen Center of Pittsburgh is located in Sewickley. 
Evening of Zen: An Introduction will take place 
December 12, at 6 pm. Daily events on Tuesday through 
Saturday include zazen, or meditation, at 5:30 am, 
morning service at 6:45 am, and zazen again at 6 pm.

A surf-rock Christmas
Los Straitjackets put the novelty back into holiday music
The members of Los Straitjackets are indistinguishable during performance 
because of the Mexican wrestler masks they wear. They were formerly known as 
The Straitjackets, but the masks changed that.
We decided to put [the masks] on during our first gig. It just worked; people 
liked it. They thought it was interesting to see us wearing these masks and playing 
instrumental rock n roll... said Los Straitjackets drummer Jimmy Lester. Danny 
[Amis] wanted to play a tribute for some of the 50s and 60s Mexican rock n roll 
bands. I guess that kind of has something to do with it. The band formed in 
Nashville in 1994.
Danny Amis, Eddie Angel, and I started the band in Nashville along with Scott, 
who was the original bass player and who quit after about four or five years, said 
Lester.
Lester (the former drummer of Webb Wilder), Angel, and Amis met at a bar in 
Nashville, where they are all originally from. Pete Curry, who plays the bass for the 
band joined in when Danny Amis moved out to California. Following The Velvet 
Touch of Los Straitjackets, the bands first album, came Utterly Fantastic and Sing 
Along With Los Straitjackets. Then came Damas Y Caballeros ... Los Straitjackets, 
which was their first live album. They decided to release another album for the 
2002 holiday season. The album, titled Tis the Season for Los Straitjackets, contains 
their renditions of 11 traditional Christmas carols, and two original tracks.
The biggest influence on their making a holiday season album was the fact that 
they all love the Christmas season.
An instrumental Christmas record just seemed like the most natural thing for us 
to do, said Lester. With the added touch of their surf-rock sound, they turned 
Christmas carols such as Feliz Navidad, Jingle Bells Rock, and Rudolf the Red 
Nosed Reindeer into danceable instrumental songs.
We play for people ranging from four year olds to CEOs, said Lester. At a 
Straitjackets show in Washington, D.C., a couple of weeks ago, the audience ranged 
from 21 to 61.
The next day we had a kids show. We played for children between four and 17, 
he said.
The feedback they get from their listeners shows that the bands last album is the 
best record they have done.
 [The song] Supersonic Guitars in 3-D is a departure from what we have been 
doing in the past, said Lester; compared to the other albums, he said, they used a 
darker and more secretive sound.
They are very different, said Israel Shalom, a junior computer science major. 
Its a fun album and it puts me in a holiday mood.
But Los Straitjackets also fall under the heading of novelty music, and especially 
around Christmastime, competition may be stiff.
I might listen to it when I am not listening to my Disney Christmas album, said 
Morgan DiLeo, a sophomore chemical and biomedical engineering major.
Pittsburghers will get to see and hear the four mysterious seores of Los 
Straitjackets at Rosebud Caf on December 6. Call 412.261.2221 for details.

8so Sifc0- 4raDs^p0
One of Wagners wackiest operas at the Benedum last week
Wagners love of Germanic myths and legends drove several of his best-known 
works, including his revered Ring Cycle. He was bitterly disappointed when the 
public received the premiere of The Flying Dutchman in 1843 with distaste.
He blamed it on poor staging in two separate productions, but the real culprit 
may have been his overweeningly wild stories, which do better in a modern direc
tors hands. The Pittsburgh Operas production of The Flying Dutchman, which 
ended yesterday afternoon, was bold enough to hold all Wagners sturm und drang. 
Though many of his touches felt hyper-modern, director Christopher Alden con
ceived the story in the grand style Wagner must have intended.
The tale itself is spooky  part ghost story, part lovers demise  but starts sim
ply. Off the coast of Holland, a sea captain and his steersman eagerly search for the 
shore. They havent been home in a great while. The Captain goes below to rest, and 
the Steersman is left on deck alone.
Courtesy of the Heinz History Center
Baritone Greer Grimsley, as the Flying Dutchman. The opera finished its run yester
day afternoon at the Benedum Center.
Because the Steersman is daydreaming, he doesnt notice at first when a huge 
ghost ship anchors next to his own. A stranger  the Flying Dutchman  boards 
their vessel, and offers the Captain a heap of jewels for the hand of his daughter in 
marriage. The Captain excitedly agrees.
Meanwhile, at a factory on shore, the Captains daughter, Senta, daydreams 
about a legend she cant seem to get out of her head. In the story, a phantom Dutch 
sailor disembarks every seven years in search of a faithful woman who will lift the 
curse from his soul and redeem him with her love. As Senta sings of the dead 
Dutchman, the factory girls laugh at her, and Mary, Sentas older companion, warns 
her that when her father returns, he will take away Sentas portrait of the 
Dutchman.
When her father brings home the mysterious stranger, Sentas daydream quickly 
turns into reality. Forsaking her huntsman boyfriend, Erik, Senta accepts the 
Dutchmans proposal and vows eternal affection. The town turns out for a joyous 
wedding. But when Erik shows up and issues the obligatory jealous threats, Senta 
is faced with a quandary: choose or die (or, quite possibly, choose and then die 
either way).
Alden has set the disturbing tone for this ultra-mod production with a startlingly 
tilted set (the scenery and costumes were originally created for the Canadian Opera 
Company). Set and costume designer Allen Moyer imagined the world of the play 
as a huge, blue-toned, wooden box, with a spooky feel that is part log cabin, part 
warehouse. The room even had a ceiling, presenting exquisite challenges for light
ing designer Annie Militello, who was forced to angle lights through windows and 
up from the orchestra pit.
Musically, Wagner has rarely been so warm and inviting. Conductor John 
Mauceri handled the orchestra with deft affection, delivering a sweet, full-bodied 
interpretation of Dutchmans otherwise icy tones. Instead of bowling us over, 
Mauceri teased the string section until they all but oozed tearful longing.
He also manages to wheedle electrifying performances of these difficult roles out 
of every singer onstage. Margaret Jane Wrays Senta is pure and less top-heavy than 
the usual Wagnerian soprano; without the traditional turkey-wattle vibrato and 
overgrown embouchure a la Elizabeth Schwartzkopf, this Deutsch daughter could 
actually be under 35. Though Wray scraped some of her highest notes toward the 
end of the show, she was otherwise solidly in control. Her extensive range is thor
oughly tested during the difficult, haunting aria that retells the legend of the 
Dutchman, but Wray has both the pipes and the lungs to fill each phrase all the way 
through.
Baritone Greer Grimsley is rich and crisp vocally as the Dutchman, and a formi
dable stage presence as well. He throws his imposing stature and a sinister sense of 
melodrama behind every line, pacing around the stage like a hungry tiger. Operatic 
acting was never more grounded, or more genuinely creepy.
As the Steersman, Jason Collins has the rich, bright sound normally associated 
with a heldentenor role  his lovely tone proves that even impossibly tough music 
can be made to sound easy by people with good technique.
In smaller roles, supporting cast members hold their own, but are less impressive. 
As Erik, Thomas Studebakers light heldentenor is barely audible at times  though 
his character is just as ineffectual as his voice, such a tinny performance is hardly 
enjoyable.

All of his operas seem to end like this, with a forbidding boom  quintessentially Wagner. But as in many myths, the moral of the Dutchmans story is muddled, 
and we are left to wonder what human feelings Wagner wanted to inspire with all 
his majestic music. Though the plotlines of his operas often seem to have little to 
do with the composers famous nationalism, Wagner always offered one tautolog
ical explanation for why he Wrote the way he did. In his diary, he boasted:
Question the incomparable magic of my works, compare them with the rest: 
and you can, for the present, say no differently than that  it is German.

Continued from p. 7
As Mary, Susan Shafer gives an older, more traditional sound. Her vibrato wob
bles, she wears a grey wig, and like every good Wagnerian mother figure, she 
warns everyone against everything, all the time.
And in the end, it turns out she was right; as all lovers must at the end of a trag
ic opera, Senta and the Dutchman die. Different versions of the libretto had Senta 
declare her undying fidelity to the Dutchman and fling herself off a cliff, while her 
lovers ghost ship sank out of sight. In this production, Erik shoots Senta as she 
holds a painting of the Dutchman to her breast. When she dies, a white light opens 
above the Dutchman, and he suddenly drops Sentas bridal veil to the ground and 
ascends a staircase toward the afterlife.

Outfoxing the Fox himself
Larry Gelbarts frontier revision of a classic deception farce skewers the American dream
The School of Dramas production of Larry Gelbarts Sly Fox left the audience 
rolling with laughter. Gelbarts comedic vision clearly played out in this wittily 
written drama. Based on Ben Johnsons Volpone, a classic play about greed and 
deception, Sly Fox is re-imagined in San Francisco during the late 1880s gold rush. 
The plays director, drama professor Jed Allen Harris, and set designer, masters 
student Veerachai Vorraratchaikul, took this theme a step further by setting the 
classic story in a saloon where greed and deception flourish. Gelbart has written 
for M*A*S*H, won two Tony awards for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to 
the Forum and City of Angels, and was nominated for an academy award for Tootsie.
Foxwell J. Sly is a devious miser whose motto is Gold is God with an L.  He and 
his indentured sidekick Able delight in tricking three old cronies out of everything 
they are worth. The two con artists start by pretending that Sly is a filthy rich, sick, 
old man on his deathbed. Three cronies, Lawyer Craven, Jethro Crouch, and Mr. 
Truckle, each have their eyes set on Stys inheritance and proceed to give him all 
they own as bribes. With Sly and Abies prodding, the men compete against one 
another by giving Sly stolen gold trinkets, helping him write up his will, offering 
him Mrs. Truckle, and other such despicable acts. While they wait by his bedside 
for him to die, each hopes that Sly will name him as his sole heir. The three men 
are almost caricatures of stereotypical sleazeballs, and will even betray those clos
est to them in order to gain Stys gold. When Sty and Abies schemes go a little too 
far, these two end up in court, facing the hilarious Bible-thumping Southern 
Baptist Judge Bastardson. Hoping to gain Stys favor, the three men rally around 
him, defending him against the charges of defiling Mrs. Truckle, until he is 
declared innocent. Sty and Able decide to skip town after their close encounter, 
but not before pulling one last trick on Craven, Crouch, and Truckle by Stys feign
ing death and naming Able his heir. The play closes with Abies attempting to pull 
one over on his master, but no one can outfox Sty, and Able is left only with his 
greed to comfort him in the end.
The cast plays well off of one another, and portray their over-the-top characters 
without being over-dramatic. Each character represents a different stereotype, 
from the gold-digging prostitute, Miss Fancy, to the slimy lawyer, Craven. They 
have flat, pigeon-holed personalities, but the play is more about entertainment 
than character development. It is the interactions of their stereotypes that create 
the comic genius of the play.
Seniors Nicholas Webber and Casey Spindler work well together to create the 
master-protege relationship. As Sty, Webber is a heartless miser who cares little for 
anything or anyone but his gold and himself. He lacks the capacity to care about 
people and only views them as entertainment; even Able is only a pawn and offers 
more amusement than camaraderie. Spindler is a little less convincing as Able, a 
quick-witted swindler with a gambling problem; this Able seems to have too much 
heart to be driven by pure greed.
Seniors Alex Cendese, Matthew Scott, and Ryan Young provide much of the 
comedy of the show as Crouch, Craven, and Mr. Truckle, respectively. Their elabo
rate costumes and make-up make them almost cartoon-like. Craven has long 
pointy fingers, which he drums like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. Crouchs snake 
walking cane and his hunched back add to his persona. Mr. Truckle has an Abe 
Lincoln-esque nose and beard, a point of irony, considering he is the opposite of 
honest. The brazen hussy (senior Lexy Fridell), the dim witted overly religious 
Mrs. Truckle (senior Audra Blaser), the over-the top, gavel-wieldingjudge (senior 
Tyler Poelle), and the sexually depraved police chief (senior Ben Murray) are more 
than just supporting characters  they are unique, and each adds his or her own 
bit to the comedy.
Vorraratchaikuls set design is incredibly clever. The furniture for each scene is 
incorporated as part of the wall and slides in and out as needed. Stys big fourposter bed is the center of the stage and Stys schemes. He spins his web of lies from 
his deathbed while those most affected come to watch him die. On either side of 
the bed, a stuffed snake and vulture hang on the wall. They silendy hint at the 
themes of the play and add to the western frontier atmosphere. The Tucker resi
dence consists of a comical full-wall mural of the Madonna, as overdone as Mrs. 
Tuckers religiousness. The courtroom scene is actually a saloon with a judges 
bench. This set-up makes comedy out of the judges admonishment to the trial 
audience, Settle down! This is not a saloon. Instead of darkly dressed, silent stage 
hands, the scenes are changed by the period-dressed saloon characters and ser
vants. Each scene change is its own small comedy act.
The characters convincingly delivered the well-written comedy and effectively 
carried off the physical comedy as well. While the play was highly entertaining, it 
dealt with a few real issues like the consequences of blind greed and misplaced loy
alty. The static characters added to the comedy, but didnt diminish the moral of 
the story. Even though Gelbarts play ran on the longer side, the show kept its audi
ence entertained until the last.

Center. Call 412.268.2407 for details.

Where can a Pittsburgher go to see a concert? With 
all the changes that have been sweeping the citys 
nightlife and concert scene in recent months, this sim
ple question is getting harder to answer.
Pittsburgh, it seems, has a cycle of changing venues; 
established midsize venues lose out to increasing real 
estate costs and close. Promoters must then find new 
venues to house their shows, while other venues pick 
up the slack and fill the void left by the closed estab
lishments. But by the time new venues establish them
selves, the same process can start over again. In the 
past few years, this cycle has cost the city such estab
lished hubs of nightlife as the Beehive, Graffiti, and 
the Millvale Industrial Theater.
To say that the Pittsburgh music scene is changing 
is kind of a redundancy, said Ian Lipsky, owner of the 
Quiet Storm, a coffee house and local venue in the 
Garfield/Friendship neighborhood. I dont think that
the music scene has ever been really stable here.
In a town already dominated by colleges, property 
values are always on the rise. Colleges are capable of 
buying property and increasing its value, and they are 
increasingly willing to do so.
Nonprofit groups run Oakland: hospitals and col
leges, said John Hayes, a reporter for the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette and the author of many articles dealing 
with Pittsburghs club scene. Schools and hospitals 
keep growing; they realize the value of real estate. 
Since nonprofit buildings dont pay taxes, they can 
buy and sell easily.
Many venues are finding it increasingly difficult to 
make money on concerts, and find they have to close.
Im sympathetic to venues closing down, said 
Lipsky. Its really difficult... the little fraction of the
money we take out of the door doesnt make it worth 
it [to have live shows].
The Quiet Storm doesnt have to worry about real 
estate issues because of arrangements with landlords, 
but Lipsky said he understands the problems other 
venues have.
Everything has to be something in addition now, 
he said. The Rex couldnt survive just as a venue, it 
had to be a bar. Mr. Smalls has to be a recording stu
dio. Quiet Storm has to also be a coffee shop.
Metropol was one of Pittsburghs largest venues, 
and by far the most popular venue of its size with 
artists. One of the few venues capable of seating over 
1000, it attracted the majority of nationally-known 
artists, and was the hub of the Pittsburgh concert 
scene. In mid-October of this year, however, the club 
was finally bought out and closed for concerts until

Clubbed to death
Can Pittsburgh concertgoers support a mid-sized musical venue?
Ruya Baraz/Darkroom Manager
Crowds gathered last Thursday night to hear DJ Paul Oakenfold at Club Laga; the club is one of the citys most popular all-ages venues, but its future is uncertain.

---------------------------------------------------

further notice.
The abrupt loss of Metropol caused a ruckus in the 
concert scene in Pittsburgh; promoters were forced to 
scramble to find new venues for their artists. Most of 
the shows were shifted to Club Laga, although some 
were transferred to other venues such as the Rosebud 
in the Strip District, Nicks Fat City in Southside, and 
Mr. Smalls Funhouse in Millvale. Although popular, 
none of them can hold the volume of people that 
Metropol was capable of holding.
In fact, the only venues of comparable size now 
available in Pittsburgh are theaters, such as the Palace 
Theater in Greensburg (which holds 1350) or various 
larger theaters owned by the Pittsburgh Cultural 
Trust  but these are not as suited for general admis
sion concerts as Metropol or Laga. Fat City, Rosebud, 
Mr. Smalls, and other comparable venues do not hold 
more than mid-sized crowds, in the 500-700 range.
The loss of Metropol might also spell trouble for 
nightlife in the Strip district.
Metropol and Rosebud [were] the anchors of that 
area. That district exists because those clubs [were] 
established, and other stuff built up around them. If 
you lose them, [youre] left just with the fluff, said 
Lipsky./
There really isnt anything left like Metropol for the 
kinds of shows that draw crowds of 1000 or more. 
Still, despite the general instability of the music scene 
in Pittsburgh, Hayes does not believe the industry is in 
real trouble.
In the short term, we might lose shows that we 
might want, but people can always find a way to open 
a new place, he said.
Not long after Metropol closed, the Post-Gazette ran 
a story about Lagas closing in the near future. Laga 
owner Ron Levick had right of first refusal on the 
building, and said he would try to buy it when he 
could raise the capital but planned to eventually turn 
it into office space or apartments.
Losing Laga would be a tremendous blow to the 
concert industry, which has just been crippled by the 
loss of Metropol. Laga holds upwards of 800 people 
and took on the majority of Metropols cancelled 
shows. As well as being one of the few remaining 
options for artists who draw large crowds, Laga is also 
an establishment in Oakland nightlife, as it holds the 
Attic, a 21+ bar/nightclub, and the Upstage, which 
both holds shows and has dance events regularly on 
weeknights.
Club Lagas proposal to sell was a surprise, because 
it deprives the whole Oakland set of kids, said Todd 
Twiss, theater manager for Mr. Smalls.
However, Club Laga mainly focuses on rock shows, 
and Levick feels that the market for such shows is on 
the decline. According to the article, he said, The
concert industry is in trouble. Were going to have to 
start charging a convenience fee for people under 21 
because the shows theyre attracted to dont make 
money for the clubs. Even on the nightclub side, some 
nights are on and some nights are off.
Shows that are doing well for promoters are all
ages shows, said Hayes. Venues dont make as much 
money on these because of the younger crowd  
there is no drinking.
Now, Lagas future is up in the air. Although Levick 
said he is definitely considering selling the space, it 
might not be cause for worry just yet.
My business is doing very well; Im just exploring 
my options, he said.
The scene changes every few years, said Mark 
Wilkes, former patron of Metropol. The Pittsburgh 
nightclub scene tends to bitch but wont go out and 
support the system.
Wilkes sentiment is shared by many owners and 
proprietors of venues throughout the city. Much of 
the problem with the concert scene now is not the 
venues, but the concert-goers themselves. Young peo
ple in particular dont show up in numbers like they 
used to, say proprietors.
Its hard to get 100 people in here sometimes, said 
Bill Ferchak, co-owner of Southsides Rex Theater.
When the show-goers are not involving themselves 
with the music scene, the price is the venues, said 
Mike Speranzo, president and joint owner of Mr. 
Smalls.
There are a number of different reasons that could 
account for the gradual decline in the customer base 
for rock venues throughout the city. One reason is 
that the youth population of Pittsburgh is shrinking.
\
People come to Pittsburgh to go to college and 
then leave, said Hayes. And although there is still 
market potential for older demographics, it doesnt 
pay as well. There is a growing market [aimed at] 
older people ... but they go to fewer shows.
Hayes also blamed part of the loss of business on an 
industry readjustment.
In the mid 90s, there was an explosion of enter
tainment in Pittsburgh. There were more entertain
ment seats than people who could fill them, he said. 
However, when it became clear that people werent 
going to stay longer, the Pittsburgh market pulled 
out.
This downsizing of the industry has gradually taken 
its toll on venues all over Pittsburgh, causing them to 
either shift emphasis onto other things, such as bars, 
or to shut down entirely. This phenomenon might 
account for the loss of Metropol, and possibly soon 
Laga.
I just think there are too many clubs, said Levick. 
They expanded too much.
Lipsky has another theory.
Things are changing, technology is changing ... 
causing big media corporations to act differently, he 
said. Its possible for anybody to lay out tracks, to mix 
them, to produce them ... theres no longer the role 
that the businesses play in whos going to get record
ed and whos not, which optimistically speaks to a 
democratization in music. What that might mean... is 
that it will have an effect on live music. Theres always 
going to be the giant venues, because theres a clear 
demand for that, but it doesnt represent the kind of 
overwhelming majority that it used to. And a lot of the 
middle-sized venues dont necessarily have the con
sistent draw that they used to.
Music in bars is what Pittsburgh primarily has to 
offer, said Lipsky. Mr. Smalls sometimes holds all
ages shows, Laga is almost entirely all-ages, and the 
Quiet Storm is general admission. For the average col
lege student, who is under the age of 21, however, the 
future might hold quite a lot of change.
Theres a lot of turnover in this business, said 
Hayes. Metropols gone, Laga might soon be gone, 
and a number of well-established clubs of the past, 
such as the Beehive, Graffiti, and the Millvale 
Industrial Theatre have closed, but that does not 
mean they are irreplaceable. There are a lot of 
rumors about other places opening. There may be a 
new showcase for music in the Strip. Clear Channel, a 
major promoter of concerts for Pittsburgh venues, 
recently merged and lost money, but may be interest
ed in recouping by building a new place.
And in the meantime, Laga is still open, and there 
are several reputable, mid-sized venues available to 
see shows. Among these are Mr. Smalls Funhouse, in 
Millvale, which seats 650 and also holds recording 
studios and a comprehensive skate park; the Rex 
Theater on the Southside, which hosts, according to 
Fenchak, a little bit of everything; the Strip 
Districts Rosebud, which Wilkes says holds classier 
acts, and Nicks Fat City, on the Southside. And for 
those more inclined toward more obscure, indie 
music, Quiet Storm is in Garfield/Friendship, a short 
trek off campus, and hosts bands with small draws in 
a comfortable coffee-house atmosphere, while the 
more club-like Mr. Roboto Project hosts shows with a 
harder sound.
Theres still a lot of things to do in Pittsburgh, said 
Lipsky, and anyone who complains that there isnt is 
foolish.

Paul Oakenfold
Club Laga still attracts high-profile DJs
The two best DJs of the commercial culture  Sandra Collins and Paul 
Oakenfold  got together at Pittsburghs Club Laga last Thursday, leaving fans 
scurrying to find tickets for the event.
Those who were not able to get their tickets before the show had to wait in line 
with hundreds of other electronic music lovers. According to Steve Quinlin, a staff 
member at Club Laga, the club can hold about 1500 people. Around 700 tickets 
were sold for the Oakenfold show, but the line outside the club was the longest 
Quinlin has ever seen.
The concert, which was supposed to begin at 11 pm, started with Sandra Collins 
performance, who was the special guest of the event. After a half-hour delay, the 
show started, and Collins disappointed the crowd with unpleasant tunes that 
sounded like they came from broken speakers.
This DJ was given the DJ of the Year award by Dance Star USA this year, and 
was not even DJing. During half of her performance, she played CDs instead of 
mixing them.
It was impossible to see her on stage, even with the best view in the room. She 
spent half her time looking for her CDs while torturing the audience with unpleas
ant tunes. She played things like a trance mix of Nirvanas Smells Like Teen 
Spirit right next to tunes by DJ Sasha.
The crowd enjoyed the music at first, but later when Collins started playing 
slower songs, they lost interest. When it was almost time for her to leave the stage 
for the next DJ, she started playing beats that kept the crowd entertained. People 
were slowly getting into the party mood. Of course, for those who actually went to 
the show to hear some good trance...
After two hours of agony, the big name of the night came up on stage (with a 
45-minute delay, of course). As could be expected from one of Englands and the 
worlds most recognized DJs, Paul Oakenfold took over the turntables like a pro, 
and the positive energy in the crowd intensified.
Oakenfold used the same sounds as he did in his last album, Great Wall, which 
included remixes of Justin Timberlakes and Madonnas songs, proving how com
mercial Oakenfold has become over the years.
People were shaking their booties, instead of feeling and enjoying the journey 
that trance music could take them on. Since Oakenfolds show started at 2 am on 
a Thursday night, the audience started leaving the venue about an hour after he 
went on. There were only about 100 people left by 3:30 am.
When Oakenfold first started spinning in the 80s, he was considered one of the 
best DJs of his time. Now, he can be considered the best mainstream/commercial 
DJ of our time. His albums are sold in the same music market as Britney Spears.
However, Oakenfold demonstrated his talents by successfully mixing his 
records. He spun as if he was trying to show off his 20 years of experience in the 
music business.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
The world was not ready for the reckless abandon with which 
Rupert approached it. He was eschewed by the church, shunned 
by the townspeople, and ostracized by the other ducks. They  *
would not accomodate Ruperts wild lifestyle, and Rupert would 1
not conform. He accepted their judgments and censorship with 
duckly grace and dignity. Still, it was a lonely existence for Rupert; his only compa
ny was his daring adventures. Rupert had long ago acquiesced to a life alone. He had 
yielded to what seemed like his inevitable fate, until one day a duck came along that 
gave him a reason to believe that love could once again exist in his empty heart. Her 
name was Cookie, and she was as sweet as the name that was given to her.
