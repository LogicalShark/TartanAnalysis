Science & Technology Editor
The Fence got a fresh coat of paint; 
chalkers made their mark on the top 
of Wean Hall; CS students vied for 
tickets to a 10 am lecture; and a tieless University President Jared Cohon 
introduced the speaker personally. It 
was official: Bill Gates was at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Gates, the chairman and chief soft
ware architect of Microsoft 
Corporation, visited CMU for the first 
time last Wednesday as part of a fivecollege speaking tour. He toured CSrelated areas of campus and spoke to 
professors about their research 
before giving a lecture titled 
Software Breakthroughs: Solving 
the Toughest Problems in Computer 
Science to an audience of about 650 
students and faculty in Rangos 
Ballroom; approximately two or
Senate 
continues 
allocations
by Jenny Kim
Staffwriter
Last Thursday, Student Senate con
vened to discuss any allocations and a 
change in how the student govern
ment recognizes organizations for 
funding.
According to Megan Flocken, fund
ing and recognition chair, the meet
ing was lengthy because there were 
many topics they had to touch upon. 
She reported that Senate allocated 
$7800 last week following the $9660 
allocated two weeks ago, and that 
there would be a change to the conthree hundred more who could not 
get tickets filled McConomy 
Auditorium to watch a simulcast.
The lecture covered a number of 
topics, including a quick overview of 
computings history thus far, current 
Microsoft products and projects, 
pressing problems in computer sci
ence such as security and artificial 
intelligence, and the position of CMU 
and the United States in the field of 
computers. At the beginning of his 
speech, he said, Computing has 
gone through a big transition in the 
last 30 years, but he closed the 
speech by saying, I think the mile
stones of greatest interest will take 
place in the next 10 years.
This institution [Carnegie 
Mellon] has made phenomenal con
tributions in engineering and com
puter science, Gates said. Microsoft 
has benefited greatly from CMU. 
Microsoft employs many CMU 
graduates and faculty, including for
mer senior faculty member Rick 
Rashid. Rashid runs Microsofts 
research program, Microsoft 
Research, which is based on SCS. The 
company hired 25 CMU graduates 
and 25 CMU interns last year, and 
currently employs 138 CMU alumni.
Gates said that an early ALTAIR kit 
with an 8008 processor motivated 
him to found Microsoft. The company 
hit a major milestone when comput
ers from several companies began to 
carry MS BASIC, Microsofts version 
of the BASIC programming language. 
However, said Gates, the 64k limita
tions of those systems held us back.
The arrival of the IBM PC was a 
milestone, he said, because it started 
a cycle of making PCs more wide
spread, which fueled software devel
opment, creating a market for even 
more PCs. The next problem was that 
companies were not creating compat
ible hardware and not even thinking 
about software.
Microsoft said, We will be neutral 
to these big companies, and make 
those systems absolutely compati
ble,  Gates said.
Computings next significant 
achievement was moving from char
acter-based interfaces to graphical 
interfaces, followed by the arrival of 
the Internet. That became, by the 
early 90s, scary. The idea that things 
could change overnight [frightened 
people], said Gates.
Volume is the secret of the soft
ware industry.... As we move for
ward, its really software that will be 
the key element, said Gates, who 
acknowledged that hardware 
improvements have helped as well. 
However, he pointed out that 
advances in hardware have hap
pened more quickly than advances in 
software, and predicted that even so,

Students may find their spring 
shopping slightly more convenient 
this year. Since the beginning of last 
January, student government has 
been trying to pass a proposal to 
start a shuttle bus that would run 
continuously from Carnegie Mellon 
to the Waterfront on weekends. This 
proposition was put forward by stu
dent body president Daniel Gilman, 
a senior in H&SS. He, like many 
other CMU students, recognizes the 
inefficiency of the public transporta
tion system.
The Waterfront debuted in 1999 
and is planned to be one of the 
largest developments in 
Pennsylvania, including 500,000 
square feet of the nations premiere 
retailers, theme restaurants and 
more than 700,000 square feet of 
the nations premiere big-box retailers. The Waterfront intends to be the 
hub of shopping, dining, and 
nightlife, which students from all 
over Pittsburgh frequent via the Port 
Authority Transit (PAT) bus system. 
However, these buses can get crowd
ed on weekends, often skipping 
stops because the occupancy is 
already filled.
There are a lot of students that 
want to go to the Waterfront on 
weekends. But on weekends, the 
buses get absolutely packed, said 
Gilman.
Serious discussions on the shuttle 
system commenced a few weeks 
ago. The details of the proposal are 
still being worked out between 
transportation officials and 
Carnegie Mellon University. Gilman 
hopes to institute buses to run from 
one stop on campus to a couple of 
stops at the Waterfront.
According to Gilman, these stops 
will most likely be at the Loews 
movie theater and the Giant Eagle
Waterfront shuttle a possibility
supermarket. There will not be any 
stops in between campus and the 
Waterfront.
We need to make sure we arent 
causing any problems with the PAT 
bus routes or conflict with their 
stops, said Jennifer Church, associ
ate dean of student affairs. We just 
want to provide student a direct line 
to the Waterfront.
Church is currently working with 
the departments of legal affairs and 
risk management to ensure that the 
University can effectively meet stu
dent demands. She said that their 
greatest concern is making sure that 
the students can all get back to cam
pus safely. Since the buses will run 
from approximately 6 pm to 1 am, 
students may find themselves rush
ing to get on the last bus back to 
campus. To address this concern, a 
ticket system which forces students 
to be issued a ticket as a round-trip

Carnegie Mellons Board of 
Trustees authorized a five percent 
increase in undergraduate tuition at 
its February 20 meeting. Effective 
this fall, tuition will be $30,650 for 
students who entered after fall 
2003, and $30,200 for students who 
entered 2000-2002.
Unlike last year, this years tuition 
increase is the same for all classes. 
Tiered undergraduate tuition levels 
were instituted beginning in 2000, 
but the University has now adopted 
a single tuition increase for all stu
dents.
There is also a new $150 technol
ogy fee, to be used to support and 
upgrade the computing environ
ment (see related article below). 
Housing costs increased 5.5 percent 
to $4964, and board costs rose 4 
percent to $3590.
Last year, CMU increased tuition 
by 8.5 percent. Carnegie Mellons 
tuition remains higher than 
Princetons and Cornells. Next 
years tuition for Princeton will be 
$29,910 and for Cornell will be 
$30,000. Princeton and Cornell, 
however, have much larger endow
ments from which to draw than 
CMU does.
The Board of Trustees does not 
consider the current tuition rate 
increases of other institutions in 
their decision because the informa
tion is not yet available, and it
would be illegal for colleges to con
sult each other over tuition rates.
According to William Elliott, vice 
president of enrollment, decisions 
on tuition increases are made with 
CMUs Strategic Plan in mind. The 
financial section of the Strategic 
Plan states that CMU aims to 
increase the size of the endowment 
by expanding fund-raising, and re
evaluating investment and spending 
strategies.
The Universitys draw on the 
endowment is based on a three-year 
running average of the endowment 
levels. According to Elliott, although 
the endowment has grown over the 
last six months as the economy has 
improved, the two prior years were 
down periods. Since the endow
ment has decreased over the past 
three years, the University draws 
less money from the endowment for 
next year.
Elliott also added that there will 
be an increase in financial aid pack 
ages comparable to the tuition 
increase, including both loan and 
grant aid.
Last semester, a meeting between 
students and administration was 
held to discuss the plans for tuition. 
Elliott said that about 100 students 
attended the meeting in September, 
and although most students did not 
want tuition increases, the senti
ment was that quality of education 
was the most important issue.
Its about the value  whats

j A $150 technology fee will appear on tuition bills this fall. It will serve in addi
tion to the existing funds allocated toward computing technology.
by Lucas Yiannatji
Personnel Manager
Next years tuition, already 
increased, will have an additional 
$150 technology fee, the first of its 
kind at Carnegie Mellon. This fee, 
similar to technology fees instituted 
at other universities to face rising IT 
(information technology) costs, will 
be employed not as a substitute for 
the general funds already going 
towards computing technology on 
campus, but as an addition to those 
funds.
Joel Smith, vice provost for com
puting services, explained the pur
pose of the new fee in an e-mail to 
The Tartan on Friday.
[The fee] will be used to address 
issues in need of attention because 
of insufficient current funding and 
to confront some new challenges, 
e.g. the increasing demands on the 
wireless network and computer 
security. Some of those issues and 
challenges, frankly, involve making 
sure that things now aging in our 
infrastructure (one of the disadvan
tages of being an early leader) dont
break and some involve addressing 
new demands, wrote Smith.
Admittedly, the fee may bring 
criticism from the student body, 
especially since the funds will not be 
used for highly visible projects, 
instead addressing deferred main
tenance issues, as well as assuring 
that Carnegie Mellon infrastructure 
remains reliable.
Ran Yi, a sophomore in business 
administration, when told about the 
technology fee, responded, I dont 
see anything wrong with the clus
ters anywhere right now, and 
theyre already taking away from 
our tuition. Now theyre gonna raise 
our tuition and charge us an extra 
$150. What kind of changes are we 
going to see?
William Elliott, vice president of 
enrollment, said Friday that he felt 
the reactions of students and their 
families to the tuition increase, 
including the technology fee, were 
mixed, but were positive overall.
Obviously, they didnt want the 
tuition to go up at all, but they 
understood. The most important

Crime & Incident
Trespassing, 2/20/04, 7:03 
pm  Campus Police responded to 
a call made by the University Center 
manager. He reported that there 
was a man sleeping in the mens 
room of the University Center. Upon 
the officers arrival, an unknown 
person was found lying on the floor 
of the bathroom. He stated that he 
had come to the University Center 
to get something to eat. TThe male 
admitted to drinking, and claimed 
that he was homeless. He was asked 
for his identification. A check for a 
warrant came up negative. He was 
given a final warning not to return 
to campus, or he would be arrested.
Spilled Water, 2/20/04, 11:19 
pm  A resident at Morewood 
Gardens E tower reported harass
ment to Campus Police. An 
unknown male had poured water 
on his floor in an attempt to threat
en him. The actor was described as
a 6'4 male, short bleached blonde 
hair, with a thick build. Upon inves
tigation, a small amount of water 
on the carpeting was observed. 
Officers informed the resident that 
he could either pursue the matter 
internally or through the local mag
istrates office. He chose to do nei
ther.
Threat, 2/21/04,3:47 am  An
unidentified male was reported by 
a student to Campus Police. The 
student claimed that he was being 
followed by a 510" white male, 
average build, brown hair, and a 
groomed full beard. He stated that 
while walking back home, he 
noticed the unknown male by the 
entrance to the Tech Garage on 
Beeler Street mumbling to himself. 
When he reached the rear door of 
Pi Kappa Alpha house, the student 
had trouble accessing the door with 
his card. At this point the male 
approached the student and said, 
Remember my face; Im going to 
kill you. The student gained entry 
into the fraternity and shut the 
door. He was informed to contact 
Campus Police immediately if he 
sees the man again.
Ride Home, 2/22/04, 2:54 
am  On a routine fraternity 
patrol, an officer observed a large
group in a minor scuffle at Beta 
Theta Pi fraternity. However, all 
persons dispersed when the squad 
car pulled up for investigation. 
While sitting in the car, the officer 
was approached by a female who 
requested a ride to Duquesne 
University. The officer explained 
that she could take a cab, catch a 
bus, or take the shuttle. The female 
become argumentative and stated, 
1 dont know why you cant just 
take me the fuck home. At this 
point she was asked to show her 
identification. She gave a drivers 
license and a University of 
Pittsburgh ID. Upon a background 
check, the name on the drivers 
license was inconsistent with the 
number. After insisting that the 
license was real, she was taken to 
the police station for further ques
tioning. The officer searched her 
purse and found a PNC Bank credit 
card with a different name. The 
female became cooperative, and 
told the officer that her name was 
the name on the credit card. The 
officer conducted a check with 
Duquesne University and verified 
the name. Thenceforth, all informa
tion given by the female was accu
rate. She was issued six various cita
tions for underage drinking, disor
derly conduct, and false identifica
tions. Her mother was notified.

2/22/04, 5:18 am  A student 
called from the Donner laundry 
room to report a unknown female 
student who had passed out on top 
of a washing machine. The student 
was entering the laundry room to 
gather her clothes when she 
noticed the female. When two offi
cers arrived on the scene, the vic
tim was unconscious with her pants 
and underwear around her knees. 
Her buttocks were inside the frontload opening of the machine, plac
ing her in a squatting position. The 
officers shook the female to wake 
her up. She awakened glossy eyed, 
slightly incoherent, and with an 
alcoholic odor. She dressed and 
attempted to sit on a chair before 
she stumbled and fell to the 
ground. Carnegie Mellon EMS

Students protest 
: computer disposal
 TUCSON, Ariz. (U-WIRE) 
! Students decked out in Hazmat suits 
.at University of Arizona had a mis
sion: to show their peers that comput
ers could kill.
The students, who wore the 
Hazmat suits to protect themselves 
from toxic computer parts on a 
nearby table, were members of the 
Arizona Student Recycling 
Association (ASRA), and the suits 
were used to attraction attention to 
the national Computer TakeBack 
Campaign.
Rob Wild, president of ASRA and a 
physics senior, said many students 
arent aware of how toxic discarded 
computers are to the environment.
Alex Perwin, a pre-business junior, 
said the suits were worn to demon
strate that computer waste is danger
ous.
Education is the biggest way to 
help change, Perwin said.
Members of ASRA asked students 
to sign a petition, and wore the haz
ardous material response suits to 
protest the disposal of computers. 
The petitions and the suits will be
sent to Michael Dell, chief executive 
officer for Dell Computers.
Wild said Dell Computers, along 
with other computer companies, 
sends old computers to agencies 
that ship them to foreign countries 
where they are improperly discard
ed.
Emily Kara, an environmental sci
ence senior, said the restrictions on 
computer disposal are not as strin
gent in developing countries, and 
thus various toxins end up in the 
water supply.
As a result, Laura Showalter, vice 
president of ASRA and a sophomore 
in biology, said citizens of other 
countries are dying.
Wild said the petitions will hope
fully get Dell to produce less toxic 
computer parts, recycle responsibly' 
and take computers back from users 
for free, rather than charging con
sumers a $15 fee.
Wilson Hughes, a waste reduction 
planner for the City of Tucson 
Environmental Services, said prop
er computer disposal is a laborintensive process, and is done over
seas at a cheaper cost.
But the toxins in computers are 
not benign chemicals, Hughes said.
According to an ASRA handout, 
overexposure to the mercury from 
the light bulbs in a computers flat 
display panel may result in brain 
and kidney damage, while barium 
in the front panel can cause brain
swelling, muscle weakness, and 
heart, liver and spleen damage. In 
addition, each computer monitor 
contains four to eight pounds of 
lead, and chromium on the steel 
plates can cause DNA damage and 
asthmatic bronchitis.
Alana Levine, program coordina
tor for Recycling and Waste 
Management and faculty adviser for 
ASRA, said the petitions and 
Hazmat suits are an effective grass
roots technique for raising aware
ness and initiating change.
It was student activism against 
Nike and sweatshops that caused 
change, Hughes said.
Wild said the national campaign 
is already making progress and has 
caught the attention of Michael 
Dell, who stopped shipping to com
panies that use prison labor last 
summer.
Pornographic 
events protested
MEDFORD, Mass. (U-WIRE)  
The Tufts Republicans criticized 
several student organizations and 
Tufts University administrators for 
their obsession with promoting a 
degraded view of sexuality in a 
February 26 press release as a 
response to recent sex-related 
events on campus.
The group objected to students, 
faculty, and administrators tastetesting lubricants, taking part in the 
Condom Olympics, and marking 
on life-sized, fully-nude drawings 
where they most like to be rubbed, 
touched, kissed, or licked, during 
Sex on the Hill, a February 11 sex 
and sexuality fair organized by 
Tufts Voices for Choice (VOX).
The press release was issued by 
the Tufts Republicans to protest 
recent events on the Medford cam
pus. The groups media campaign 
received coverage in the Boston 
Metro newspaper, New England 
Cable News, Fox25 (WFXT), Google 
News, World Net Daily, and 
Newsmax.com.
[The fair] was pretty outra
geous, and in very poor taste... 
there was nothing meaningful 
about relationships, loving, and 
caring, president of the Tufts 
Republicans Philipp Tsipman said. 
The display of pornographic 
posters of reproductive organs and 
the distribution of genitalia-shaped 
cookies at the fair played into a 
campus culture in which all [stu
dents] are doing is thinking about 
sex.
The Tufts Republicans release 
asked fellow Tufts students to 
reconsider the hook-up culture on 
the Tufts campus by promoting 
the truly healthy conceptions of 
love and relationships.
Tufts VOX president and Sex on 
the Hill organizer Judith Neufeld 
responded by saying, in many 
ways, I think were combating the 
hook-up culture. Many relation
ship problems stem from the lack of 
communication between partners, 
and the use of alcohol. We encour
age safe sex and responsibility 
among partners..
Neufeld called the release 
shocking, and out of left field. 
According to Neufeld, the event 
drew 400 to 500 attendees to the 
event in the Mayer Campus Center, 
and garnered an extremely posi
tive [response] from the general 
campus community.
Nothing at the fair would be 
considered legally pornographic...it 
was less about raunchy sex and sex
ual acts and more about promoting 
healthy sex, Neufeld said. 
Organizers deliberately avoided 
placing anatomically correct, med
ically accurate, drawings in the 
main lobby of the Campus Center, 
and opted instead for the more dis
crete conference room downstairs.
Though Tsipman said he has 
received several e-mails in support 
of the Tufts Republicans protest, 
Reitman said, I have not heard 
complaints from anyone [other 
than the Tufts Republicans]. I have 
heard from many parents  they 
thought the programs were very 
valuable and well done.

Polish soldiers fire on 
Muslim pilgrims
KARBALA, Iraq (AP)  Polish soldiers shot 
at a bus full of Shiite Muslim pilgrims when it 
failed to stop at a checkpoint on Sunday 
,February 21, wounding several Iraqis and one 
Pole.
A witness said the troops opened fire after 
the bus apparently lost control of its brakes, 
hit a minivan and then swerved into a con
crete barrier at the checkpoint manned by 
Iraqi and Polish forces.
The Polish military said the troops believed 
they were coming under attack.
Abbas Hassan, a member of the U.S.-trained 
Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, said the troops used 
heavy firepower for several minutes, targeting 
all cars coming in on the highway from 
Baghdad. He said the gunfire destroyed the 
right side of the bus.
Bleeding passengers were pulled from the 
bus and another vehicle behind it carrying 
more than a dozen people, witnesses said. 
Hassan said one Civil Defense Corps officer 
lost his leg when a piece of the bus struck him.
Col. Zdzislaw Gnatowski, a military 
spokesman in Warsaw, initially described the 
incident as a suicide attack using a car bomb. 
But he later gave an account more in line with 
that of the witnesses.
He said one Polish soldier was evacuated to 
a hospital in Karbala, 12 miles south of the 
checkpoint and that a number of Iraqis were 
wounded but he didnt know how many.
Shiite Muslims are traveling to the holy city 
of Karbala, 50 miles south of Baghdad, for the 
10-day mourning festival of Ashoura.
The festival marks the death of one of the 
Shiites chief saints, Imam Hussein, a grand
son of the prophet Muhammad. It is expected 
;to draw 1.5 million pilgrims, including about 
100,000 Iranian Shiites.
Further south, hundreds of Iraqis rallied 
against coalition troops Sunday after U.S. sol
diers fired on a car that failed to stop when a 
military convoy passed by, killing one Iraqi 
!and critically injuring another.
The shooting took place near Rumaythah, 
135 miles south of Baghdad, near the city of 
:Samawah where Dutch soldiers and some 230
Japanese troops are based. The soldiers are 
working to supply Iraqis with clean water, 
rebuild schools and bolster local hospitals.
A crowd gathered around the site of the 
shooting, where the car sat with its windows 
broken, chanting Down with America! Down 
with Bush! U.S. soldiers and Dutch marines 
trying to clear the roadway were pelted with 
rocks and taunted.
The rally caused Japanese commander Col. 
Koichiro Bansho to cancel his trip to the town.
Couple marry in 
popular supermarket
LONDON (AP)  Instead of walking down 
the aisle, the bride  and her 11 bridesmaids 
 glided up a supermarket escalator.
On Saturday, February 28, scores of shop
pers filling up their grocery carts in a store in 
the northern English town of York paused to 
watch as Jill Piggott, 42, and Pete Freeman, 
54, tied the knot.
The couple, who became the first Britons to 
officially marry in a supermarket, chose the 
location where they met when Freeman was 
shopping and Piggott was working the check
out aisle.
People get talking at the checkouts. Its 
often the same regular faces, said Asda super
market spokesman Ed Watson. With Jill and 
Pete, they got talking over the baked beans 
and they took it from there.
The bride made her grand entrance up the 
stores escalator, wearing a strapless white 
gown, and was accompanied by the bridal 
party through the menswear and underwear 
sections to the ceremony in the shoe depart
ment.
The couple departed after the ceremony for 
110 official guests to the sound of Scottish bag
pipes.z
Our friends thought we were crackers, 
said Piggott shortly after she became Mrs. 
Freeman.
Britain has strict rules governing civil wed
dings, and until 1994 nonreligious ceremonies 
were restricted to official registry offices. 
Couples now have a slightly wider choice, such 
as hotels and manor homes, for their nuptials 
if the sites are licensed by local authorities.
The Asda supermarket in York, which sells a 
range of goods from groceries to clothes, was 
the first to receive a license to conduct wed
dings on the premises.

Cops caught in issuing 
tickets as a contest
PORTERDALE, Ga. (AP)  A contest 
between two police officers in a small 
Georgia town to see which one could issue 
the most traffic tickets was stopped by a 
judge who overheard the apparent winner 
talking about it, the mayor of Porterdale said.
Part-time Porterdale police officers Erin 
Cox and Frank Jackson wrote about 150 tick
ets in January, which was significantly high
er than in previous months, Mayor Paul 
Oeland said.
Some tickets were for minor offenses 
including not reporting an address change to 
the state or having defective equipment on a 
vehicle. The contest was first reported in The 
Covington News.
The contest was revealed when City Court 
Judge C. David Strickland overheard the offi
cers talking about it recently. Oeland said 
Jackson indicated he had won the contest.
I think it was sort of bragging rights, said 
Oeland, a lawyer. They would make a traffic 
stop for a legitimate reason and then try to 
find anything else they could possibly write a 
ticket for.
The mayor added: It is not anything that 
we as a city support.
Both officers were asked to resign by 
Friday, February 27, by city manager Tom 
Fox, Oeland said. They have been with the 
department less than a year, he said.
Neither could be reached Friday. There 
was no answer at the police department.
Marines sent to Haiti 
after president departs
WASHINGTON (AP)  President Bush on 
Sunday, February 29, acknowledged the con
stitutional successor in Haiti after the depar
ture of Jean-Bertrand Aristide and sent 
Marines to help quell violence on the turbu
lent island nation.
Its the beginning of a new chapter in the 
countrys history, Bush told reporters as he 
returned to the White House from Camp
0v
David hours after Aristide departed the 
Haitian capital by plane.
Bush acknowledged that Haiti now has an 
interim president as per the constitution in 
place, but did not refer to the new leader, 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Boniface 
Alexandre by name. Bush urged Haitians to 
reject violence and give this break from the 
past a chance to work.
The United States is prepared to help, 
Bush said.
The democratically-elected Aristide left 
Haiti with help from the United States, State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher 
said. He provided no further details.
When asked where Aristide went, Bushs 
national security adviser Condoleezza Rice 
replied, A third country. She would not 
elaborate.
The U.S. forces are the first phase of an 
interim international force to help stabilize 
Haiti, wracked by a deadly four-week upris
ing that has killed more than 100 people.
The administration planned to consult 
with allies about seeking a U.N. Security 
Council resolution that would authorize 
international support for a peaceful and con
stitutional transition of power, Boucher said.
He said other countries are prepared to 
join the military mission, and want to help 
Haitians quickly form an independent gov
ernment.
We call on all Haitians to respect this 
peaceful and constitutional succession, 
Boucher said.
Earlier Sunday, a senior administration 
official said after the one-time U.S. ally left 
Haiti that Aristides decision was in the best 
interest of the Haitian people.
Marines assembled to help repatriate 
Haitian migrants aboard Coast Guard ships.
Rather than send the Marines by ship, as 
was considered before Aristides departure, 
they were expected to go by air in order to 
arrive more quickly, said defense officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity.
The plan was to fly in as many as several 
hundred Marines to assist the Coast Guard at 
one or more Haitian ports, the officials said. 
Such a force, known as a special Marine AirGround Task Force, was standing by at Camp 
Lejeune, N.C., a major Marine Corps base.
The centerpiece of such a task force would 
be elements of a Marine infantry battalion 
that is always on short-notice alert at Camp 
Lejeune, supplemented by Marine aircraft, 
and logisitcs.

Organ requiem for 
Rogers at church
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A church 
organist raised on the music of Fred 
Rogers, better known as Mister Rogers, 
will debut a requiem Sunday that he 
composed for the late childrens televi
sion pioneer.
Luke Mayernik, 21, studied the 
organ at Duquesne University and 
musical composition at Carnegie 
. Mellon University. Hes the organist at 
St. Justin Church, a Roman Catholic 
parish on Mount Washington, which 
overlooks the city. He got the idea to 
write In Memoriam: A Requiem for 
Mr. Rogers from one of Rogers 
friends.
Maggie Stewart, who portrayed 
Mayor Maggie on Mister Rogers 
Neighborhood, turned to Mayernik 
with her idea of a musical farewell. 
Having grown up on Rogers music, 
Mayernik ran with the idea and com
posed a one-hour requiem in 11 move
ments based on the Catholic Requiem 
Mass.
Anyone who watches his show 
immediately feels the invisible arms 
just wrapping you, Mayernik said of 
Rogers, who died last February 27 of 
stomach cancer. Mayerniks requiem 
debuts on the first Sunday after the 
one-year anniversary of Rogers ^eath.
Mayerniks work will be intro
duced by the Slippery Rock University 
Orchestra and Chorus.
The requiem will be the first of two 
musical tributes to Rogers in 
Pittsburgh.
On March 27, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestras gala concert 
will feature The Music of Fred 
Rogers, an event hosted by game 
show host Pat Sajak and CNN News 
anchor Paula Zahn.
Before Rogers studied child psychol
ogy and theology, he got a college 
degree in music composition. Rogers 
played the piano at age five and the 
organ at seven.
Rogers best known song is Its a 
Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
To write anything, even one song, 
that absolutely becomes part of the 
national consciousness is pretty amaz
ing, and he wrote so many, said David 
Stock, a composer and artistic director 
of the Pittsburgh New Music 
Ensemble.
Of course, theyre simple, but sim
ple is not simple-minded. Theyre 
beautifully crafted. Its very difficult to 
write things that are uncomplicated 
and direct that are of high quality.
Mellon sued over 
Dreyfus marketing
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A federal 
lawsuit charges that Mellon Financial 
Corp. and its Dreyfus Corp. subsidiary 
wrongly spent mutual fund assets on 
marketing expenses, including pay
ments that induced brokers to push 
Dreyfus funds to their customers over 
other investments, a federal lawsuit 
charges.
The U.S. District Court lawsuit was 
filed in Pittsburgh earlier last week by 
Noah Wortman, a Dreyfus investor 
from New Castle, Del., who owns 
shares of a Dreyfus stock-index fund.
It alleges that those who guide the 
Dreyfus investment funds violated 
federal securities laws surrounding 
what are known in the industry as 
12b-l fees, which are named for a 
section of mutual fund laws.
The fees, devised in 1980, are gen
erated by liquidating a small percent
age of a funds assets to pay for mar
keting fees which, in theory; help the 
fund to grow even more.
But in practice, while funds have 
grown, theres been little reduction of 
fees along with those economies of 
scale, said Kerry OBoyle, a mutual 
fund analyst at Chicago-based 
Morningstar.
Wortmans lawsuit says that hun
dreds of thousands of investors have 
been harmed because the marketing 
fees are paid to brokers. The practice 
created an undisclosed conflict of 
interest and caused brokers to push 
clients to Dreyfus funds, regardless of 
the funds investment quality relative 
to other investment alternatives.
The marketing fees were used to 
pay for sales contests and other incen
tives for brokers to sell the Dreyfus 
brand funds, the lawsuit states.
A spokeswoman for New Yorkbased Dreyfus declined comment last 
Thursday, saying the fund company 
hasnt seen the lawsuit.
Wortman is seeking unspecified 
damages, saying his investment 
prospectus didnt disclose that 
Dreyfus would improperly siphon 
assets from his fund to cover Dreyfus 
marketing expenses. The lawsuit, 
which was filed last Wednesday, also 
says that 22 Dreyfus funds were 
closed to new investors so a marketing 
fee could not possibly have been 
used to market and distribute them 
to new investors.
Wortmans attorney, Alfred Yates of 
Pittsburgh, is hoping to get the law
suit classified as a class action.
The lawsuit highlights a growing 
area of controversy in the mutual 
fund markets, OBoyle said.
Lawmakers have even talked about 
abolishing 12b-l fees, though no for
mal action has been taken.
This is a serious matter thats get
ting widespread attention because it 
gets to the heart of how funds are sold 
and how fees are charged, OBoyle 
said.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN  MARCH 1, 2004
New tuition surpasses $30,000
TUITION, from page Al
delivered for dollars charged, said 
Elliott. He explained that rising costs 
necessitate tuition increases in order 
to maintain the standard of educa
tion we have currently.
I do worry... that the everincreasing tuition might prohibit 
students of lesser means from 
attending CMU, eventually deter
ring quality students from applying 
based on staggering cost, wrote
Paul Richelmi, student body vice 
president for finance, in an e-mail.
The student activities fee 
increased 10 percent to $163. 
According to Megan Flocken, chair 
of the Student Senate funding and 
recognition committee, the increase 
was necessary due to greater needs 
for organizational funding. Theres 
been an incredible increase of stu
dent organizations over the last five 
years, said Flocken.
Over the past several years, some
students have campaigned to open 
the books on the Universitys budget. 
They want to be able view Carnegie 
Mellons budget in order to see 
where students money is going.
Until detailed information about 
Carnegie Mellons operating budget 
is known by students, were in the 
dark, wrote senator Daniel 
Papasian, a sophomore social and 
decision sciences major who is run
ning for student body vice president 
for finance in April.Technology fee effective this fall
FEE, from page Al
issue was quality, quality, quality. 
We dont want the quality of the 
place to go down, and wed obvious
ly like to continue to improve, and 
we understand on the margin that 
may cost more, said Elliott. You 
and I enjoy a network here thats 
probably better than any.
Gerrit Betz, a first-year in ethics 
history and public policy, already 
knew about the fee.
I dont really see the point of it, 
considering that theyve been paying
for computing stuff the whole time 
anyway, so obviously theyve been 
getting the money from somewhere. 
Why they cant just take more money 
from there, and why theres a sepa
rate fund I cant understand.
Elliott explained that the comput
ing fee will be instituted largely for 
economic reasons.
The real issue is an accounting 
issue that the committee tries to take 
into consideration. You and I are just 
part of the users. We ought to not 
necessarily pay for the whole thing, 
nor have we paid for the whole
thing, but this is basically a way to 
spread the costs in a better way, so 
that those who use the facility get a 
chance to pay their fair share, said 
Elliott.
Weve now got a cost structure, 
so that we can basically go over to 
somebody whos in the research 
industry [who uses our systems] and 
say You gotta pay your fair share. 
Smith wrote, I see this as a need
ed change, and, yes, definitely as a 
commitment to providing highest 
quality computing infrastructure 
and services.
Senate members see improvement
SENATE, from page A1
stitution concerning the recognition 
of funded organizations. Senates 
constitution now requires a non
funded organization that wishes to 
attain funded status to be recog
nized for a full year. The rule can 
only be overruled by a 2/3 majority 
vote of Student Senate. 
Organizations seeking funding from 
student government may now be 
forced to re-plan their funding situa
tion. According to several senators, 
the rule makes official a long-standing tradition in Senate to hold off 
from funding organizations until 
they have been recognized for at 
least a year.
Senate Chair Vito Fiore said the 
changes are cosmetic and there are 
debates at times over where the sur
plus money will go. He believes that 
the excess funds should go back into 
the budget for student organiza
tions. Nicholas Scocozzo, internal 
development chair, agreed with 
Fiore.
The Senate works hard to repre
sent students and not ideals of the 
individual, Scocozzo said.
Some of the campus organizations 
and events that Student Senate has
allocated money toward are the 
Water Polo team and the paintball 
team. The money will cover the 
entrance fees for an upcoming paint
ball tournament. Other organiza
tions such as the Thai Students 
Association and the Vietnamese 
Students Association were given 
money to support their respective 
events, such as Thai Night 2004.
Flocken also felt that Senate is 
improving, despite what she calls 
minor controversies it may face from 
an ambiguous constitution. She said 
she appreciates how bright and tal
ented the senators are and how they 
put their hearts into their work.
Fiore said he looks forward to new 
ideas. He mentioned how Senate, 
and especially the Academic Affairs 
board, is attempting to expand 
library hours. In addition, dining 
services is deciding on opening new 
facilities and changing the meal 
plans.
So far 15,000 out of the 63,000 
dollars were used for special alloca
tions, Fiore said. The pace at 
which Senate is giving money seems 
to be going well.
Several Senate members con
curred, saying that not as much 
funding will be allocated during the
rest of the semester because the 
majority of expected requests have 
been dealt with. There are six more 
meetings for Student Senate. To 
make changes to the constitution 
and to discuss these future plans, 
Scocozzo hoped to confront these 
difficulties during the meeting held 
on the first Thursday after spring 
break.
To keep track of Student Senate 
plans, Flocken encouraged people to 
listen to the radio station WRCT for 
Senate News. She said that Senate 
gets a minute and a half at 8 pm to 
make announcements. This is a less
er known method that Student 
Senate is using to broadcast their 
plans. Senator Ed Ryan from 
Senates communications committee 
is in charge of this project.
Fiore and Flocken both encour
aged students to get involved in the 
upcoming elections. Fiore said that 
those interested in holding an execu
tive position should hand in their 
petitions by March 22 and that those 
interested in a Senate position 
should hand in their petitions by 
March 27. x

SHUTTLE, from page Al
pass is under debate. These tickets 
would give an estimate as to how 
many students are boarding the 
buses, thus allowing the University to 
provide an appropriate amount of 
seating.
The prospect of a private CMU 
shuttle is not a new one. In 1998, 
Student Affairs instituted the Tartan 
Express, a bus that ran from campus 
to Squirrel Hill, Edgewood, and 
Monroeville. The bus ran every week
end from 10 am to 8 pm, so there was 
not as much concern returning peo
ple back during the late hours. 
However, after the University author
ized an agreement with PAT in 1999, 
students were permitted to ride the 
bus with their ID as a pass; thus, 
Tartan Express was no longer need
ed.
After the demand dropped, we felt 
that the shuttles were not needed 
anymore, said Michael Murphy, 
dean of student affairs. To my 
knowledge, Dan Gilman was the first 
one to propose another shuttle sys
tem.
The shuttles will be modeled after 
the Tartan Express.
We know how to run this, said 
Church. We are going to be doing 
the same things we did six years ago.
The buses are intended to be stan
dard Laidlaw school buses with an 
approximate occupancy of 60 people. 
In previous years, the costs for run
ning these buses for two nights each 
weekend were $600, but final totals 
for this coming spring re still being 
worked out with the bus company. If 
all goes as planned, student affairs 
will sponsor the emergent shuttle 
system and cover the costs for this 
year. In the upcoming semester, after 
observing how successful the system 
works, the student body will discuss 
possible extra costs being integrated 
with students tuition.
If all goes well, we should be able 
to start it as a pilot program some
time this month, said Murphy.

CMU Red Team favored in desert race
by James Tetlow
Staffwriter
Imagine a ten-hour race over 
extremely rough terrain from 
California to Nevada between twen
ty unique vehicles, each designed 
with cutting-edge technology for 
maximum speed and durability, with 
the winner taking home a million 
dollar prize. Now imagine that same 
race, but without any human control 
after the Start button gets pushed. 
Carnegie Mellons Red Team is one 
of the twenty robot-racing teams 
entered in the Defense Advanced 
Research Program Agencys Grand 
Contest, a race intended to acceler
ate the development of autonomous 
vehicle technologies that may even
tually be used in military applica
tions.
The problem is conceptually sim
ple  you have to pass through a 
desert, said Sam Harbaugh, a 
Carnegie Mellon Software 
Engineering distance instructor and 
Red Teams system engineering 
leader. Red Team is composed of two 
parts: the vehicle team and the map
ping/routing team. The vehicle team 
is currently preparing for the race in 
Nevada, running the teams heavily 
modified Humvee, christened 
Sandstorm, through routines being 
sent to them by the mapping/rout
ing team. The mapping/routing 
team, which is currently based in the 
Planetary Robotics building on cam
pus, has to plot Sandstorms course, 
a duty Harbaugh compared to lay
ing out breadcrumbs to smooth out a 
path.
The most interesting thing about 
this is the sheer volume of data and 
editing we have to do, and how we 
handle that, said William Starmer 
of TerraSim, a local company provid
ing the Red Team with its core map
ping tools. The route the vehicles 
will take will not be disclosed by the 
DARPA until two hours before the 
race, so each team will need to plan 
its routes extremely quickly. There 
are roughly a thousand waypoints 
within the route, and they vary from 
areas as wide as several miles to as 
narrow as a railway underpass. 
Currently, the Red Team can plan

(left), head of the mapping/routing team, in the Red Teams war room.
out a route within an hour, but the 
extra hour will be needed to double
check and smooth out the course 
so Sandstorm wont fall into a ditch 
or careen over a canyon rim.
Red Team is currently testing 
Sandstorm to reduce the danger of 
Sandstorm encountering such obsta
cles.
The agenda changes every day, 
said William Red Whittaker, direc
tor of the Field Robotics Center and 
the leader of Red Team, which is 
named after him. Yesterday 
[Sandstorm] was slugging out every 
mile in deep mud and water was 
spraying up over the height of the 
vehicle. Were here to run a race in 
the desert, but what people dont 
realize is when it is the rainy season 
and there is a water crossing, it is a 
testimonial to the machine that we 
can progress in all situations we 
encounter. Sandstorm is built to be 
as rugged as possible, and has a 
range of 320 miles.
According to Harbaugh, 
Sandstorms engine was just turboHow Things Work:
Trackpads
Since I explained traditional 
mice, optical mice, and trackballs 
in this column last year, a number 
of laptops have felt left out of the 
fun, because I didnt explain their 
trackpad pointing devices. I would 
have done it sooner, but its not an 
easy mechanism to understand, 
and I fear that readers without a 
strong background in physics will 
have no idea what Im trying to say, 
and those of you that have taken a 
few physics classes will find this 
column about as interesting as see
ing how fast you can make your 
cursor trace circles by swirling your 
finger around on the trackpad.
The trackpad, also known by the 
less-descriptive term touchpad, 
was invented by a fellow named 
George E. Gerpheide in 1988. 
Gerpheide and his small company 
patented the technology and called 
it GlidePoint, but it didnt see com
mercial success until Apple 
Computer introduced its 
PowerBook 500 series laptops with 
trackpads in 1994. Since the track
pad mechanism doesnt have any 
moving parts, its less prone to 
being fouled by dirt and dust.
The trackpad relies on a princi
ple called coupling capacitance to 
know where your finger is. This has 
been defined as the transfer of 
energy from one circuit to another
Kevin Chang/Science and Technology Editor
by means of the mutual capaci
tance between the circuits. 
Capacitance is a measurement of 
the ability to store electric charge
 its the potentially lethal charge 
stored in a very large capacitor that 
makes opening up a television or 
CRT monitor dangerous.
Underneath the trackpads sur
face are two layers of tiny rows of 
parallel wires known as electrodes. 
One row runs from side to side, 
and the other from top to bottom, 
with a thin layer of material 
between them. The two layers form 
a grid  any point on the grid can 
be identified by the two wires that 
cross paths at that point. 
Alternating current runs through 
the wires, and there is a measur
able capacitance between the two 
layers of electrodes. When you 
touch the pad, a tiny amount of 
current from one of the wires trav
els through the surface of the pad, 
and through your fingers, to anoth
er wire. This miniscule change in 
the current through the wires 
changes the capacitance between 
the two wires that cross paths 
under your finger. This change in 
capacitance can be measured, and 
is associated with that spot on the 
grid, so that the computer knows 
thats where your finger is. As you 
move your finger across the tiny 
grid, the computers cursor tracks a

charged, and the vehicle's speed is 
much faster than the published 
speed of a normal Humvee. Speed is 
extremely important for the Quality 
Inspection and Demonstration, or 
QID, which takes place from March 
8-12 and features a 1.5 mile obstacle 
course with an overpass, a ditch, a 
route bounded by boulders, a steep 
hill, and similar obstacles. The time 
each vehicle takes to complete the 
QID will determine the order in 
which the vehicles will begin the 
race, and because vehicles stir up 
dust and are difficult to pass safely, it 
pays off to start first.
The biggest challenge comes 
from the combination of speed and 
pounding terrain, said Whittaker. 
In extreme terrain, a machine is 
jolted and jittered, and at high 
speeds youve got to compute at the 
rate that the world is flying by. The 
Red Team has created perception 
software that adapts the speed of the 
vehicle to the terrain and perceived

University presenting Feynman Lectures
by Karen Hoffmann
Contributing Editor
Richard Feynman, the brilliant lec
turer and Nobel Prize-winning physi
cist, spoke to students and faculty on 
The Law of Gravitation in an over
crowded Adamson Auditorium last 
Tuesday. Despite the hot, standingroom-only hall, the audience hung on 
every word and the room often rip
pled with laughter.
He did not just describe the history 
of the law of gravity, the method and 
character of its discovery, its range of 
application, or its limitations; he 
emphasized the people behind the 
science. Physically expressive, he told 
jokes, gave some of his observations 
on life, and told anecdotes about his 
family.
But Feynman, who, alas, passed on 
in 1988, was only present on film. He 
originally gave the lecture in 1964 at 
Cornell University as part of the 
Messenger Lecture Series, called 
The Character of Physical Law, 
while he was a professor of theoreti
cal physics at the California Institute 
of Technology. The hour-long lec
tures were recorded on 16mm film by 
the BBC and recently became avail
able on video. The remaining six lec
tures in the series will be shown in 
the coming weeks (see sidebar). In 
next weeks lecture, The Relation of 
Mathematics to Physics, Feynman 
will elaborate on his first lecture by 
talking about how gravity works.
Jim Hoburg, professor of electrical 
and computer engineering, who 
organized the lectures with Indira 
Nair, vice provost of education, said 
that he has admired Feynman since 
he first saw the lectures 30 years ago.
Theyre certainly timeless, he 
said. Thirty years makes absolutely 
no difference. Indeed, although the 
audience in the black and white film 
looked different from the one watch
ing the film, with a lot more ties and 
thick black glasses, Tuesdays audi
ence reacted the same way - with fre
quent outbursts of laughter and, at 
the end, with appreciative applause.
Few of the massive crowd stayed 
for the scheduled post-lecture discus
sion, prompting Hoburg to say, I 
have the feeling that we dont need to
have a discussion after each lecture. 
People just want to come and hear 
the lectures.
But several interesting points did 
come out during the discussion: 
Kunal Ghosh, a physics professor, 
elaborated on the physics problems 
Feynman had described, saying they 
hadnt been solved in the intervening 
40 years, though theorists had made 
some progress. And Nair, who earned 
her PhD in the field of physics, said, 
There was nothing I could catch in 
the lecture that was not true, that 
had been displaced.
The first lecture was repeated on 
Friday afternoon for those who were 
unable to see it in its original show
ing. The next lectures will be moved 
to larger rooms to meet the over
whelming demand.
I thought the response would be 
good, but the attendance of students 
exceeded my expectations, wrote 
Nair in an e-mail to The Tartan.
We simply didnt realize what the 
response would be, wrote Hoburg in 
an e-mail. But, he said, he was not 
completely taken by surprise. We're 
a community of people who value 
rich, stimulating ideas, he wrote. 
So it's certainly not surprising to see 
lots of people show up to learn and be 
inspired by a great mind.
The idea for showing the lecture 
series at CMU began when Hoburg 
found a source for the old lecture 
series on video several months ago. 
He contacted Nair to see if she would 
be interested in getting them for CMU 
as a university celebration of univer
sal ideas. She was.
To many of us who were in under
grads in the 60s and 70s, Feynman's 
teaching was known as legendary, 
wrote Nair. Feynmans populariza
tion over the years through main
stream media, in books like Surely 
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, has 
made him well-known to the general 
public, wrote Hoburg. But in my 
view, it's when Feynman talks about 
physics that his genius and passion 
for truth, which extend far beyond 
physics, are most apparent.
Students at the lecture called it 
interesting and fun. Neil Halelamien, 
a senior computer science and psy
chology major, said he plans to come 
back to see the rest of the lectures.
Bill Gates gives software lecture at CMU
GATES, from page A1
processors will double in power every 
two years, will hold for 15 to 20 more 
years. The hardware is not holding 
us back, he said.
The watch Im wearing has a tiny 
microprocessor.... Its got a million 
times as much power as an original 
IBM PC. If you compare it to a US 
nuclear submarine, its got more pro
cessing power, Gates said.
Networking was a major theme 
throughout the lecture, and Gates 
anticipated that it would be a field of 
major progress in the near future. 
Ultra-wideband networking has let 
us disaggregate PCs, he said, and 
predicted that advances in WiFi, 
peer-to-peer filesharing, and the 
802.16 networking standard should 
bring broadband costs down for rural 
areas and poor countries.
Gates also spoke about the eco
nomic impact of software develop
ment. The economy is largely made 
up of people dealing with informa
tion, he said, noting that businesses 
current system of dealing with simple 
things like handling invoices can be 
unnecessarily complicated.
Advancing productivity is the 
major thing.... As software progress
es, we can make these information 
processes more efficient.
The talk wasn't completely serious; 
to address the problem of spam, 
Gates pulled selected pieces of junk 
mail from his own inbox and poked a 
little fun at himself. One piece 
offered quick degrees online (Gates 
dropped out of college to build 
Microsoft). Another hawked a solu
tion for getting people out of debt 
(nobody in the world has as much 
money as Bill Gates). A third offered 
legal advice cheap (Microsoft shows 
up in the news perennially on charges 
of acting like a trust).
Gates used some of his time to 
show off recently unveiled and 
upcoming Microsoft products, the 
first of which was the SPOT Watch, 
also known as the Smart Watch, 
which displays weather forecasts, 
stock information, and short text 
messages in addition to serving as an 
appointment calendar and clock. He 
also showed pictures of the soon-tobe-released Portable Media Player, 
which will be able to play movies and 
show pictures in addition to playing 
music files.
On the software side of things, 
Gates presented two Microsoft pro
grams that were nearing the end of 
development. The first was Media 
3D, a program that lets users cycle 
through movies and then select films
with the same director, actors, posi
tive reviewers, genre, or other simi
larities. The other was MediaFrame, 
a graphical display for photo and 
movie organization. Thumbnails of 
pictures and movies seem to stack 
themselves based on a number of fea
tures, including time/place taken, 
prominent colors, whether they were 
taken inside or outside and whether 
or not they include faces.
Microsoft has shown its optimism 
about these things by putting so 
much money into research and devel
opment, Gates said. Microsoft spent 
$6.8 billion on R&D this year alone.
We and our counterparts here at 
CMU are working on very similar pro
jects, Gates said, adding that he was 
impressed by much of the research
I love every day. 
Coming in every 
day, working with 
smart people, 
solving these 
problems.
 Bill Gates
CMU students and faculty are per
forming. Microsoft gives between 
$200,000 and $400,000 in grant 
money to CMU research every year, 
and helped found the CMU west 
coast campus at Mountain View.
Several students got the opportu
nity to ask Gates questions after his 
lecture concluded. Ed Ryan, a junior 
in physics and president of KGB, 
asked him whether he ever used 
Linux, and presented him with a copy 
of the Linux distribution Knoppix. 
Gates did not keep the CD, saying, 
We have Linux up and running at 
plenty of places at Microsoft; its not a 
hard operating system to get.
Linux is out there, we take it very 
seriously, said Gates about the chal
lenge it poses to Microsofts Windows 
operating system. At any part of 
Microsoft history, theres always 
something people were holding up as 
the dominant paradigm shift [away 
from Windows]
KGB's activities for Gates visit were 
not limited to the question-andanswer session. KGB members took 
the fence and used it to parody the 
Blue Screen of Death, the bright 
blue display that old versions of 
Windows would show when they

Benjamin Greene, a senior computer 
science and English major, said he 
wished more professors could be as 
engaging as Feynman.
Its too bad he didnt give lectures 
on how future lecturers should lec
ture, he said.
It is great to see the students come 
together for such an intellectual 
activity, wrote Nair. I hope this 
attendance continues. Feynman's 
clarity and simple ways of explana
tion are timeless in their ability to 
educate and impress!
crashed. An unknown group also 
chalked BILL PH34RZ WEAN!!!1!1 
onto the top of Wean Hall. 
Additionally, students put a penguin 
on the University Center, but security 
removed it before Gates arrived.
Gates visits universities often, but 
last week's trip was the first time he 
has ever visited several schools con
secutively to speak to students. In 
addition to CMU, he visited the 
University of Illinois, Cornell, and 
MIT, which all have top-ranked com
puter science/engineering programs, 
and Harvard, where he attended 
school as an undergraduate before 
dropping out to work on Microsoft.
The end of the lecture comprised a 
question and answer session for stu
dents moderated by Randy Bryant, 
head of the computer science depart
ment. During the Q&A session, he 
said that the two recent advances in 
technology that surprised him were 
the Internet and wireless technology. 
We went all these years ... and then 
at CMU and elsewhere, the Internet 
hit critical mass, he said.
Addressing one students concerns 
about technology erasing human 
uniqueness, Gates said, the nature of 
computing connected to the Internet 
leaves leeway for individuality.
Gates said that his goals had not 
yet been fulfilled, but that he was 
happy with the current state of the 
world, in terms of both geography 
and technological advances. I love 
every day. Coming in every day, 
working with smart people, solving 
these problems, he said, though he 
added, Only about a third of the 
Gates/Allen dream has been ful
filled.
Many people in technology fields 
today express worry about outsourc
ing of jobs to countries such as China 
and India, but Gates downplayed 
those fears, saying, The best work
force during my lifetime will be in the 
United States. He also said that with 
networking technology, manufactur
ing can be outsourced while engi
neering and science remain in the 
US. However, he did call on the U.S. 
to renew its edge and return to the 
days of the 1980s when it was on top 
in tech fields.
After the lecture, Gates attended a 
demonstration of projects by stu
dents and researchers at the 
Entertainment Technology Center at 
which he discussed more specific 
issues, and a roundtable session with 
journalists including The Tartan (See 
related article to the right).
Editor's note: Ed Ryan is a member of 
The Tartan's comics staff.
Roundtable 
features Gates
by Kevin Chang
Science and Technology Editor
Bill Gates, the chairman of 
Microsoft, spoke of the past, pre
sent, and future of his company and 
computing in general last 
Wednesday. (See related article in 
News.) After his lecture concluded, 
he met with journalists from the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the 
Cleveland Plain Dealer, the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and The 
Tartan for a short roundtable dis
cussion.
Kate Kirsch, Microsofts Eastern 
Region Public Relations Manager, 
gave Gates a shortintroduction. 
She said that Gates often visits uni
versities, but has never before lec
tured to students like he did at 
CMU. He often speaks to faculty 
about their coming innovations, 
areas of specialty, and big bets for 
the future.
After Kirsch's introduction, the 
roundtable discussion began. The 
Tribune-Review asked for elabora
tion on the position of the U.S. in 
the international technology field, 
on which Gates had touched during 
his lecture.
Were a little concerned that CS 
enrollment rates in the US are 
going down, though not at CMU, 
he said. Other countries CS 
enrollments are going up.... As the 
worlds getting better with all these 
advantages, as a creator, we have to 
renew our commitment.
However, Gates said that for 
now, the U.S. remains on top of the 
field, and he expressed his respect 
for Carnegie Mellon.
Carnegie Mellon is fantastic, 
just knowing the work that goes on 
here. The guy who runs Microsoft 
Research [Rick Rashid] used to be 
a professor here, he said, noting 
that Microsoft hires about 30 CMU 
graduates every year. Its hard to 
think of some collaboration in CMU 
that were not interested in.
Gates attributed much of 
Microsofts good relationship with 
CMU to alumni who keep in touch 
with professors and the opportuni
ties the company offers to Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Our internship program is the 
most important thing, he said. 
Typically grants from Microsoft to 
CMU run $200,000 to $400,000 a

ROUNDTABLE, from page A5
year, Gates said. We have a strong 
relationship, and were very openminded to doing more. He declined, 
however, to say whether Microsoft 
would occupy any space in the 
Collaborative Information Center 
currently under construction in 
Panther Hollow or make any gifts to 
the University beyond the usual 
grants.
The Post-Gazette asked Gates to 
further explain his position on Linux. 
Linux is out there, and we take it 
very seriously, he said. [It] is a 
major phenomenon, and in some 
ways it is a competitor to Microsoft.
We [at Microsoft] believe very 
strongly that in almost every scenario 
we can provide better value through 
our innovation and ongoing things 
we provide to the consumers, he
said. The open-source people dont 
want there to be software jobs and 
software companies and things like 
that. We believe in a mixed model 
where there is free software and com
mercial software. Some of their peo
ple dont believe in a mixed model.
Gates also expressed his apprecia
tion for biomedical research at the 
roundtable, once again as a follow-up 
to a part of his lecture.
The pace of innovation in these 
two fields is amazing; in the next 25 
years, well have understandings of 
heart disease and cancer, he said, 
adding that he hoped that new dis
coveries in the disciplines of comput
ing and biomedical fields would feed 
off of each other.
[Even] somebody who is going to 
write C code the rest of their life bet
ter read The Iliad and understand 
public policy issues, Gates said.
Bill Gates, chairman and chief software 
architect of Microsoft, lectured before 
going to the roundtable discussion.

Electrical conduction is how trackpads work
TRACKPADS, from page A5
similar path across the screen.
Since trackpads dont rely on pres
sure or heat, you cant use one if 
youre wearing mittens or have par
ticularly greasy fingers  electricity 
has to be able to flow through your 
fingertip. So, while these devices are 
generally impervious to the dirt and 
dust that can foul a trackball, water 
droplets on the pad will confuse the 
circuitry, since water conducts elec
tricity. Likewise, if you accidentally 
touch the pad with two fingers at 
once, it detects a change in capaci
tance at two non-adjacent points on 
its grid, and doesnt know what to do 
with that information, so the cursor 
may jump around erratically on the 
screen.
Thats the one major drawback to 
trackpads from a technological 
standpoint  they actually measure 
position, rather than movement. 
Trackballs and mice cant only know 
when theyre being moved, so they 
just tell the computer to move the 
cursor in a given direction  theres 
no way to make a jump from one 
point to another without passing 
through the points in between. If you
touch a trackpad with multiple fin
gers, or get it wet, it will tell the com
puter to display the cursor at nonadjacent locations, which results in 
cursor behavior thats largely incon
sistent with what we expect from our 
computers. The trackpads inventor 
saw the device as a more natural way 
for humans to interact with graphical 
human-computer interfaces, but this 
unnatural behavior (and the advent 
of affordable optical mice that also 
benefit from a lack of moving parts) 
has limited the appeal of the technol
ogy to laptops and devices like 
Apples iPod.

risk factor of a route.
The greatest problem is innovat
ing a new system, and getting it to 
work at the high operating perfor
mance we need ... and until we have 
both, there is risk at every instant. 
High speed in these conditions can 
cause things to go wrong very quick
ly, and the consequences of colliding 
into a canyon wall or driving over a 
cliff can only happen once, said 
Whittaker.
It is actually possible that none of 
the teams vehicles will make it to the 
end of the race  the time con
straints, range, and ruggedness of the 
Grand Challenge are unprecedented. 
If none of the teams complete the 
race within ten hours, the Grand 
Challenge will continue to be held 
every year until 2007. Currently, the
Roundtable
Red Team is the favorite for this race, 
due to a combination of factors 
including superior funding and 
CMUs history with robotics and rac
ing.
The most interesting thing for me 
has been to see how much you can get 
done when you get the right partners 
together, said Juan Pablo Gonzalez, 
a second-year PhD student in robotics 
and one of the many student volun
teers working with the Red Team. 
We have the best technology, lots of 
people who normally would not be 
working for the same cause, and right 
now were getting really good things 
done.
This is a pickup team of volun
teers, students, and sponsors, and it 
has astounded me that such a great 
team, so competent and committed, 
has risen up, said Whittaker. The 
extent to which people have exhibitcoming up
ed greatness in doing this continues 
to be an inspiration, and it is a privi
lege to lead this team. The Red Team 
members have been working since 
April 2003 to be prepared for the 
race, which is on March 13.
If nobody wins, we will re-commit, said Whittaker. It would be a 
tremendous opportunity to restart 
and evolve and reiterate... if we win, 
it would be even more wonderful. We 
will have the opportunity to evolve 
and reiterate, but also have the 
resources and culmination of what 
we set out to do. The third option 
doesnt exist  nobody can lose by 
participating in this kind of con
test.... This movement is not about a 
machine, a race, or an event. It is 
about the evolution of thinking 
machines at work in the world.... 
This is much more of a beginning 
than an end.

PITTIS TB TUI RGHTBS
Editor:
Lift Every Voice and Sing was written to 
commemorate Abraham Lincolns birthday 
in the year 1900. This anthem is a hymn of 
solidarity. The past editorial concerning this 
second anthem makes very general state
ments about blacks and whites^, while 
accusing the administration and this 
anthem of dividing the community along 
racial lines.
This outrages me and many other mem
bers of this community. Various people 
might not react the same way to this 
anthem, but the beauty of this anthem is in 
showing triumph over oppression, struggle, 
and adversity. This is relevant for ANY peo
ple in present-day America.
This isnt an attempt to be separate but 
equal; it is also about instilling a sense of
birthright and heritage in a people who have 
been denied these rights for over 400 years. 
Why attack an anthem that gives legacy to 
people who cannot trace their family history 
back more than five generations, primarily 
due to slavery? Slavery, Americans best 
kept secret.
After reading this poorly researched edi
torial, I have only one response: Know your 
history. President Bush was quoted in a 
2002 article: Nobody can understand this 
country without understanding the AfricanAmerican experience.
The Black National Anthem is not just a 
part of Black history; it is American history. 
This anthem is a part of the bigger picture: 
our collective history.
Should there be a national anthem that 
only a certain percentage of Americans feel 
comfortable singing in public? The StarSpangled Banner doesnt apply to every per
son in America. Yet we sing it often, without 
written words, although its outdated and 
doesnt represent the new ethnic world to 
which the editors refer.
James Weldon Johnson didnt intend to 
write, Lift Every Voice and Sing as an 
anthem, but he did agree that the song not 
only epitomizes the history of the race, and 
its present condition, but voices their hope 
for the future. In remembrance of this past 
and a testament to the future, various peo
ple in Black History Month and throughout

Adult-themed college magazine 
welcome on Ivy League campus
The phrase H-Bomb has been used by 
Harvard students for years to describe how 
name-dropping their alma mater can immedi
ately boost their workplace credential. Now, 
however, the name has taken on an alternate 
face: H-Bomb, a student sex magazine con
cept brought to Harvards Committee on 
College Life.
H-Bomb was almost unanimously approved 
after members of the committee perused an 
issue of Vassar Colleges similar erotica maga
zine, the five-year-old Squirm. Contrary to 
accusations of chauvinism, it was two female 
undergrads  Katharina Cieplak-von Baldegg 
06 and Camilla A. Hrdy 05  who proposed 
the magazine, and they are thinking about 
passing out the first issue during commence
ment ceremonies in May.
H-Bomb, which will publish twice annually, 
will feature articles on sexual issues and  as 
you may have guessed  will contain several 
spreads of nude photography featuring 
Harvard undergraduates. Because of liability 
issues, nude photos will not be shot inside 
Harvard buildings; but other than that, the 
students have free reign. Although it has been 
approved, H-Bomb wont necessarily receive 
funding by the University; instead, its mem
bers will have to apply for outside grants.
The easy response to this news is to laugh. 
Naked Harvard students? Thatll be a small 
readership. Even the Harvard Independent, a 
weekly newsmagazine, jokes sarcastically: 
Will there be faculty cameos? Does anyone 
want to see a faculty cameo? Not only is the 
issue far more complicated than such humor 
implies, but its also addressing a much larger 
crowd than one might think after entirely too 
much of a wait.
Open sexuality is not a novel idea on the 
Harvard campus, which in recent years has 
been surprisingly more liberal than its stodgy 
Ivy League status suggests. For example, every 
semester for at least the past thirteen years, 
Harvard undergrads have participated in an 
event dubbed Primal Scream. At midnight
on the night before finals, hundreds eagerly 
gather in Harvard Yard and strip down to their 
socks and shoes. The crowd then gathers en 
masse to run circles around the yard in -a 
naked craze that could only result from a 
semester at one of the most stressful universi
ties in the country. In that respect, its almost 
a wonder Carnegie Mellon had not thought of 
it first. The band even plays  naked, of 
course, except for their band jackets.
Although it is not an officially sanctioned 
Harvard event, Primal Scream is an accepted 
tradition; one might wonder how they get 
along during the December run. In fact, its 
such a regular event that Harvards 121-yearold paper, the Crimson, even runs yearly arti
cles and (cropped) pictures. As further testi
mony to the campus sexuality, one might also 
remember last winter, when members of the 
Harvard Crew Team erected a ten-foot-tall 
snow penis in the middle of their 
Tercentariary Theater.
So is the induction of an erotica magazine 
such as H-Bomb really such a surprise, espe
cially after universities such as Vassar, Smith, 
and Swarthmore already publish versions of 
the idea? Yes, Harvard still has its conserva
tive bastions: a bi-weekly journal, Salient, was 
founded in 1981 to provide an alternative to 
predominantly liberal campus press and has 
recently published an article addressing such 
open sexuality in a publication.
Such sentiments cannot, however, skirt the 
fact that this is an important moment in con
temporary college social history. It breaches 
the taboo ice on the traditionally delicate 
topic of sexuality; hopefully, if done in a taste
ful manner, it will help put a more comfort
able and lighter spin on something that our 
puritanically-born society can take such pains 
to hide. The introduction of H-Bomb will not 
be a revolution, but neither will it go unno
ticed. Instead, it merely supports the concept 
that as college students, free speech should 
be upheld, especially when concerning an 
issue so basic and undeniable to our rights.
University must better justify 
tuition hikes to student body
The fall of 2004 will offer yet another 
tuition increase to Carnegie Mellon students. 
The five percent increase will escalate tuition 
over the $30,000 barrier; first-years and 
^sophomores will pay $450 more than juniors 
.. and seniors.
A recurring theme among tuition increases 
over the years has been the lack of explanation 
provided by the University as to why they 
actually occur. A press release sent out ten 
days ago read, Funds resulting from the 
tuition increase will be used by the University 
to attract and retain outstanding students and 
faculty. This statement is quite vague and 
unsubstantiated. Exactly what will be done 
with the extra tuition to retain the current stu
dents attending Carnegie Mellon? What 
impact will this extra tuition have on attract
ing students and faculty?
These questions have not been addressed by 
the University (and if they have been, they 
have not been made public), and thus remain 
unanswered. Again, students remain left out 
in the cold, wondering how they themselves 
will actually be impacted by the increase in 
tuition.
Furthermore, the University seems disinter
ested in making any statements about tuition, 
only willing to use broad cookie-cutter attri
butions. Case in point: in the aforementioned 
press release from ten days ago, President 
Cohon states that Because of our national 
and international reputation, we have been 
able to attract students of the highest caliber. 
These students come to Carnegie Mellon with 
high expectations, and we are required to 
meet those expectations with educational pro
grams, technology advantages, and student 
services and facilities that are of the highest 
quality. In last year's version, the same quote
 word for word  is attributed to Vice 
President for Enrollment Bill Elliott.
Students at the University of Chicago knew 
prior to this year where their extra tuition 
funds were going. Their university debuted a
$50 million, state-of-the-art athletics facility 
last August. The building features a high-tech 
gymnasium, two floors of workout ?areas, 
numerous conference rooms, and a row of tro
phy cases that display the Universitys accom
plishments over the years. As a full-service 
building, there is almost always a free workout 
machine tooise somewhere.
Carnegie Mellon currently has but six tread
mills across the entire campus  residence 
halls notwithstanding  for use by thousands 
of students, faculty, and staff. A new athletics 
facility would not only benefit current stu
dents at the University, but it would attract 
prospective students. The former athletic 
areas could then be allocated toward improv
ing technology, an aspect of our campus com
munity that is already state-of-the-art.
On that note, in addition to the extra $1500 
that each student will have to pay next year, a 
$150 technology fee will also appear on our 
invoices. Once again, Carnegie Mellon stu
dents have received vague, unexplained rea
soning for why this fee is being applied. Nearly 
every student at Carnegie Mellon owns at 
least one personal computer, which asks the 
question why it is necessary for everyone to 
dish out an extra $150 to improve the technol
ogy in clusters. For many students, the clusters 
1 serve as nothing but midday road-stops to 
check mail or to do word processing  appli
cations for which the clusters are already suf
ficient.
If the University is going to require students 
to dole out more money every year, in addi
tion to the already high tuition, room, and 
board costs, it must begin to substantiate its 
reasoning to all members of the campus com
munity.
Theres very little question that Carnegie 
Mellon is able to do amazing things with the 
tuition money they bring in, but continued 
skirting around the concrete benefits of large 
yearly increases will only make people look 
forward to graduating.

Gibsons Passion fails to realize potential
Bary Dunn
This is ridiculous seemed to be the 
recurring quote from the moviegoers who 
sat a row behind me at a Friday evening 
showing of The .Passion of the Christ. 
Ridiculous it was, as Mel Gibson portrayed 
the brutal battering of Jesus in his final 12 
hours of life throughout the majority of the 
film. There was very little educational value 
to be gained from watching this film, as 
Gibson failed to depict Jesus as the didactic, 
prophetic leader he truly was. Instead, view
ers watched as he was tortured for two 
hours.
The film began in a dark, vaporous 
Garden of Olives, with the films cinematog
raphy at its best. I was waiting for a sponta
neous battle to strike up the opening credits, 
but the brief battle did not come until 15 
minutes of the films calmest scene had 
passed, and the credits never came  per
haps because Gibson attempted to stress as 
best as he could the importance and impli
cation of the film. Gibson cornered himself 
by depicting the Jews as backstabbers from 
the start of the film, as they found no alter
native to submitting Jesus to the Sanhdrin 
for his insane beliefs and proclamation of 
being the Messiah. The Sanhdrin, a politi
cally empowering group of rabbis, was 
responsible for the mans ultimate demise. 
However, the vast assembly of Jews (whose 
beliefs were not necessarily embodied by 
the Sanhdrin)  the people whom Jesus 
educated  were not responsible, as Gibson 
led the viewers to believe.
After being captured by the Sanhdrin,
and then submitted to the Romans, Jesus 
was battered for nine straight minutes  
nine minutes which felt like an hour. With a 
host of Romans (and some Jews, with looks 
of agony) watching this inhumane carnage, 
the Roman soldiers continually whipped a 
helpless Jesus who, after having fallen from 
being whipped so many times, gained the 
strength to stand back up and endure even 
more. The leader of this group of inhuman 
Roman soldiers, who maintained the samq, 
insistent-upon-more-beating look on hijs 
face throughout the scene, ordered his 
brainwashed soldiers to put down the sticks, 
and continue the thrashing with metal rods 
decorated with spikes on the end. Gibson 
had one of the soldiers strike the metal rod 
into a large piece of wood prior to paining 
Jesus, probably to stress how treacherous

Ethical treatment of animals key to safe food
'pUdhjii Mirage
Michael Croland
The meat industry employs cost-efficient 
means to exploit animals for food. Animals 
are sentient beings who deserve better treat
ment than high-risk, cost-cutting strategies. 
Consumers should be skeptical of any busi
ness practice that disregards ethics in favor 
of profit. The recent wave of disease among 
American poultry, cattle, and fish demands 
a long overdue wake-up call.
Last week, Mexico, the European Union,
and several Asian countries enacted or 
strengthened bans against American poultry 
imports. These actions followed the discov
ery of avian influenza on a Texas chicken 
farm. Paranoia stems from a similar out
break in Asia, which led to the deaths of at 
least 22 people and precautionary slaugh
ters of more than 25 million chickens and 
ducks.
These tough times are commonplace in 
the livestock industry. In the last few 
months, numerous reports and crises have 
called into question the safety and merits of 
consuming animal products from a horren
dous system of mass production.
In December, a cow in Washington state
tested positive for bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy, the brain-wasting disease 
commonly known as mad cow. Remairis 
from that single cow were feared to have cir
culated and entered the food chain in about 
a fifth of U.S. states. Many countries 
throughout the globe banned U.S. beef and 
American consumers grew rightfully wary.
Until the mad cow outbreak, cattle who 
were too diseased to stand or function regu
larly entered the food chain. The beef indus
try found it more profitable to keep socalled downers alive until they were 
slaughtered for consumption.

Film takes 
poor angle 
on Christ \
PASSION, from page A9
these weapons truly were. It was at 
this point that the whispers began 
throughout the movie theater: This 
is enough. ,
To the crowd of Jews and to th;e 
crowd of moviegoers, Jesus, the car
penter and alleged (at least to some) 
peacemaker, unfortunately was not 
the retaliating soldier they wanted 
him to be. There was no fighting 
back, no escaping, just tolerance, as 
Gibson proclaimed. And the thrash
ing of the mans body continued.
When his hike to the top of the 
mountain began shortly after the 
halfway point in the film, I had 
expected more post-crucifixion 
action. But the walk surely did last fdr 
the majority of this second hour, a 
Jesus fell time after time after time 
while the Romans continually bat
tered him. His third collapse, like 
many of the others en route to his cru
cifixion, was shown in slow-motion. 
The whispers throughout the audi
ence commenced once again  it wajs 
quite enough. We got the point.
The brutalities continued at the 
peak of the mountain; and believe 
that the actual posting of Jesus onto 
the cross was just as gory as the pre
ceding action throughout the film. 
The blade as it sliced through his 
hand, the hammer as it hit the blade, 
the blood as it squirted through the 
backside of the cross  Gibson 
showed it all. Again I was forced to 
watch with one eye opened, shriek
ing, much like Mary did at the sound 
and sight of every moan, every beat|- 
ing that Jesus endured, as she wit
nessed his plight firsthand.
Passion failed to capture the true 
essence of Christ. Sure, his passion 
was undoubtedly portrayed through
out the film  his passion for Mary, 
for the Jews, and even for the 
Romans: Love your enemy, he stag
ed. But the goriness and violence 
superseded the educational value 
that could have been gained from 
watching the film.
Americans across the country have 
been warned to base their decision of 
seeing the film not on whether they 
wish to learn more about the final 12 
hours of Jesus, but whether they can 
withstand two hours of blood and tor
ture. Furthermore, the films likely 
detriments profoundly outweigh its 
benefits. Many viewers anti-Semitic 
interpretations may lead to pre
dictable extremes. In response to thj 
concern, Gibson softly added that the 
film is not anti-Semitic and he is not 
an anti-Semite. If truth be toie, 
Gibson failed miserably by not apologizing to the public for his fathers 
open statement that the Holocaust 
never existed.
I understand the importance of 
portraying how tough Jesus was, but 
Gibson took the absolute wrong 
approach, and the movie was thus 
way over the top. As a result, this film 
will never be considered among the 
better movies on the subject of Chris! 
and his crucifixion. What saved the' ' 2film from suffering even more was 
the tremendous acting, namely that 
of Jim Caviezel, who played Jesusl 
Otherwise, the cheap, fluffy flash
backs of Jesus bond with the Jews 
and his visionary leadership just did: 
nt cut it, and the film failed the 
potential it could have ultimately, . - KSSiS)achieved.

Steroid cover-up damaging our role-models
Ceppos
Somewhere in San Francisco there 
is a small, dilapidated, recently 
abandoned building. Unlike most 
vacant buildings, there are fresh 
coats of white paint covering up 
what used to be the most distinct 
parts of its faade, including a sign 
which formerly read BALCO (Bay 
Area Laboratory Co-Operative), but 
there was no way BALCO could keep 
covering up its performance-enhanc
ing steroid ring from the Justice 
Department.
In December, numerous 
high-profile clients  profes
sional athletes  were sub
poenaed amidst little fan
fare to testify before a 
federal grand jury 
about their connection 
to the lab. It wasnt until 
two weeks ago when 
attorney general John 
Ashcroft announced a 42- 
count indictment of 
famed sports nutritionalist Victor Conte, BALCO 
vice-president James 
Valente, Olympic cham
pion track and field 
coach Remi
Korchemmy, and 
Greg Anderson,
Barry Bonds per
sonal trainer 
and long-time 
associate, that 
BALCO 
became a
household 
name.
Apparently,
BALCO, as well 
as the designer 
steroid tetrahydragestrinone 
(THG), have
been names
known in locker 
rooms and clubhouses 
around the world for 
some time. At least five 
international track champions 
involved with the Bay Area 
Laboratory Co-Operative have tested 
positive for THG and face loss of
medals as well as the possibility of
lifetime bans from International 
Association of Athletics Federations 
competition. Anonymous random 
drug testing conducted last season 
by Major League Baseball revealed 
that over five percent of players test
ed positive for steroid use, forcing 
the league to ban all non-employees 
from clubhouses and implement a
stringent new testing policy, 
promising to enforce fines and sus
pensions for repeat offenders. This 
replaced the leagues former drug 
policy, which depended wholly on a 
players initiative to seek treatment.
The only thing more insulting 
than the long overdue intention of 
MLBs policies to act as a deterrent, 
years after performance enhancing 
drugs first became an issue, is the 
current policy taken by the Justice 
Department dealing with the crimi
nal action of athletes. This policy of 
indictment by rumor, innuendo, and 
idle threats 
i  i instead of
\ I \ through
 Lizza McGregor/Art Staffrecourse is a 
true travesty.
Federal agents in their investiga
tion uncovered over $60,000 divided 
into envelopes from individual play
ers, invoices listing charges for 
growth hormones and the clear, a 
product containing THG, as well as 
e-mails to specific named players 
with nutritional schedules.
In a statement made by Anderson, 
the trainer admitted to selling illegal 
substances to many baseball and 
football players. With the ostensible 
plethora of evidence being more 
than enough to build a case against 
the four men charged for selling 
steroids it is hard to believe that all 
of BALCOs customers were unaware 
of what they purchased.
Issuing the indictments, Ashcroft 
said, Illegal steroid use calls into 
question not only the integrity of 
athletes that use them, but also the 
integrity of sports they play. Steroids 
are bad for sports, theyre bad for 
athletes, and theyre bad for young 
people that hold athletes up
models. 
Action, or inac
tion, on behalf of the government 
only perpetuates the conception of 
athletes as role models and mani
fests into a grotesquely obvious double-standard.
Athletes themselves have only 
fueled further controversy through 
the press. This week Colorado 
Rockies reliever Turk Wendell open
ly accused Bonds of using steroids
and lying about it to the public, as 
did Wendells teammate Denny 
Neagle who also questioned New 
York Yankees first baseman Jason 
Giambis connection to BALCO.
Although it has been several 
months since he testified before the 
grand jury, Yankee outfielder Gary 
Sheffield continues to demand that 
he be tested to clear his tarnished 
name. Astros second baseman Jeff 
Kent has gone as far as to say Babe 
Ruth could have been taking perfor
mance-enhancing drugs.
Even managers have testified in 
the court of pubic opinion. Bonds 
former coach and current manager 
of the Chicago Cubs, Dusty Baker, 
drew parallels between the 
current steroid scandal 
and the Red Scare of 
the 1950s.
Its like
McCarthyism or 
something, Baker 
told ESPN. Theyre 
looking to see who 
looks like a commu
nist. Ill probably get 
in trouble for [say
ing] that too, but 
thats how I equate 
it.
In response,
Anaheim Angels 
manager Mike 
Scioscia gave the 
Associated Press 
his opinion: I
dont have the per
ception its a witch 
hunt. I see it as a 
priority in the sys
tem to make sure the 
playing field is level 
for everyone, he said. 
And if testing were in 
place earlier, a lot of 
these guys would have 
been exonerated. 
However, testing was not 
previously implemented 
and the path to clemency 
can no longer be decided 
through the media or in a Major 
League ballpark or an 
International Association of 
Athletics Federations hearing or 
even through belated drug testing.
The current Red Scares grasp on 
the sports world can only be released 
from the place in which it was first 
addressed. The Attorney General 
and the Justice Department must 
quickly bring formal charges against 
these criminals and restore integrity 
to our role models.

Experts claim animals diet causing diseases
DISEASE, from page A9
Unsurprisingly, downers are the most likely candi
dates for mad cow; however, only 10-15 percent 
of downers are tested for mad cow, according to a 
syndicated column by Wayne Pacelle, senior vice 
president of the Humane Society of the U.S. 
Typically, over 70 percent of downers are 
processed into food. Animal advocacy groups have 
toiled for years to outlaw the slaughter of down
ers, favoring euthanasia to put a more immediate 
end to their suffering. Although such legislation 
has passed both houses of Congress several times 
in recent years, it has been repeatedly squashed by 
industry lobbyists in conference committees.
On December 30, the USDA instituted an inade
quate ban against using downed cattle for human 
food. Congress must follow suit by banning the 
slaughter of cattle and other animal species for 
food and the skin trade. This ban is the only ethi
cally and healthfully sound solution for all con
cerned parties.
Some beef-eaters contend that they will be safe 
so long as they dont outright eat cattle brains or 
nerve tissue, but veganism advocate Dr. Michael 
Greger urges them to reconsider. As Greger notes,
stunning methods preceding slaughter tend to 
scatter prions, the brain proteins most feared for 
mad cow, to meat areas of cows bodies. Beef 
stock, beef extract, and beef flavoring are often 
made from skeletal remains, including the verte
bral column. In 2002, a USDA report found that 
35 percent of risky meat products contained cen
tral nervous system tissues. Many cuts of steak, 
such as T-bones, contain bovine spinal cords.
Even animals muscle cells may contain danger
ous prions, according to research conducted by 
Stanley Prusiner, who won the Nobel Prize in 
Medicine for the discovery of prions.
In January, the L.A. Times reported on a study 
published in Science, noting that factory-farmed 
salmon contains perils which people should not 
consume in significant quantities. The study said 
that there are approximately 10 times as many 
PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), dioxins, and 
pesticide residues in farmed salmon versus their 
counterparts in the wild. More than 80 percent of 
salmon in this country come from such farms.
Much like feeding cows to each other was not 
taboo until recently, the salmon problem also 
results from the feed. Salmon farmers use pellets 
ground up of small fish, which are rich in oils that
expedite growth but contain environmental tox
ins.
If [nations like Japan that banned U.S. meat] 
cant import beef, they cant import chicken. They 
are probably going to start depleting the oceans of 
fish pretty soon, panicked a U.S. Poultry and Egg 
Export Council spokesman to Reuters last week. 
Maybe the non-Western world can return to a nat
ural way of life, not pressured to consume 
unhealthy U.S. meat and poultry.
American consumers must accept that weve hit 
upon a trifecta of diseased poultry, cattle, and fish 
in our food supply. Industry practices are so hor
rendous that sheep and pig meats may soon be 
found to be contaminated, as well.
The livestock industry exploits food-producing 
animals for profit without adequately considering

POLO, from page A12
was making several spectacular 
saves, the barrage of shots from 
CMU forwards got four through in 
the first quarter and five through 
before Pitt was able to retaliate. The 
Pittsburgh effort, though strong, 
was unable to counter the initial 
five-goal lead and the hat-trick by 
Lustgarten within the second quar
ter alone.
By the end of the third quarter, 
the CMU team had all but wrapped 
up its portion of the tournament, 
holding a 9-2 lead over Pitt, and 
while Pitt scored several goals in the 
trash time, the CMU lead was too 
great to overcome; the Tartans won 
11-6.
Some of the teams leadership 
were hesitant to comment on perfor
mances of specific players, noting 
that in such an involved team sport, 
no member is more nominally 
important than another.
What most impressed me about 
the tournament is [that] I cant say 
anyone screwed up, said 
Lustgarten, commenting on how the 
team pulled its play together for the 
games.
The final standings for the tourna
ment had Army taking first with an 
undefeated 4-0 record, home-team 
CMU taking second at 3-1 and 
Toledo in third with a .500 record 
over the two days. No team, howev
er, left disappointed because of the 
quality of competition.
not only did we stretch our 
legs, said Lustgarten, we estab
lished a rapport with the other 
teams. He added that their oppo
nents tentatively invited them to 
their events and expressed an inter
est in returning here next year.
Eventually the team might make a 
move toward varsity status, a move 
whose difficulty is easily seen in the 
struggles of other club sports, but 
their short-term goals are welldefined. There are both advantages 
and limits to being entirely studentrun, but expansion will require more 
manpower than the players can con
fidently provide.
We would really like a coach, 
said Lustgarten, explaining that it 
was a key to some of their future 
plans.
For now, theyre content with 
themselves, proud of their achieve
ment, and looking forward to their 
next tournament at Virginia Tech 
next month.

given day, and theyll need them in 
order to take the division, which 
could happen. However, I think 
Anaheim and Seattle are too 
strong. Pitching wins in the play
offs, but some offense is required to 
get there. If Oakland gets in, how
ever, they couldwin it all, so any 
team that draws them in the post
season could be in trouble.

Georgia Tech has been surprisingly 
good, as well, and the resurgence of 
North Carolina under Roy Williams 
is one of the biggest college basket
ball stories of the year. Florida State 
has also turned a bunch of heads, 
and is on the bubble for an invitation 
to the Big Dance. (Perhaps some of 
the Wingenville magic rubbed off on 
them, after their winter break prac
tice at Skibo.) And when two of your 
three worst teams are Maryland and 
Virginia, your conference aint shab
by.
And then there was Duke. That 
would be No. 4 should be ranked 
higher Duke. In Mike Krzyzewski, 
they have the classiest coach in 
Division I basketball. In freshman
Luol Can Do All Deng, they have 
one of the nations premier diaper 
dandies. They are so good, in fact, 
that when players on opposing 
teams try to criticize them, the best 
they can come up with are childish 
jibes. (To J.J. Redick: The last time I 
saw Scooter Sherrill, he was playing 
Frisbee, so dont let him get to you.) 
I am not necessarily predicting them 
to go all the way this year, but it also 
wouldnt surprise me if they did.
The most fervent Duke haters 
often bring up the fact that Blue 
Devils dont do well in the NBA. First 
of all, Elton Brand and Carlos Boozer 
would beg to differ. If you subscribe 
to this flawed school of thought, I 
wouldnt want to run into either of 
them in the alley behind PHI at

has been a while (read: forever)

If you cant go to Duke go to 
State. If you cant go to State go to

cant do that, you could probably 
play ball for Pitt.

Mens basketball loses tough game to Rochester
J.T. Trollman/Photo Editor
Junior guard Eliot Goren drives down the lane against the Yellow Jackets.
 by Khalid El-Arini
 StaffwriterJf
I The Carnegie Mellon mens bas* ketball team finished off its regular
 season in heartbreaking fashion on 
 Saturday, as they lost to No. 3 
I University of Rochester in a hard 
*' fought 73-71 game. A raucous
crowd of over 600 in Skibo 
Gymnasium watched the Tartans 
compete with one of the premier 
Division III teams in the country, but 
the crowds cheers were not enough 
to prevent Rochester from winning 
the University Athletic Association 
title, and an automatic bid to the 
NCAA Tournament:
The Yellow Jackets narrowly
avoided what would have been only 
their second loss of the season, and 
moved to 13-1 in the conference 
(24-1 overall), while the Tartans 
dropped to 6-8 in conference play 
(14-11 overall). This was only the 
Tartans second loss at home this sea
son.
The game was close throughout, 
with the largest lead of the after
noon, a six-point Carnegie Mellon 
advantage, coming in the first half. 
The Tartans led for most of the game, 
but fell behind in the closing minute 
and could not come away with the 
victory. Carnegie Mellon went into 
the half down 33-30.
Solid Carnegie Mellon defense 
forced eighteen Rochester turnovers, 
in comparison to the Tartans twelve. 
Shaky ball-handling by the Yellow 
Jackets guards led to fifteen 
Carnegie Mellon steals, including 
one by junior guard Jason Walters to 
start off the second half, which he 
punctuated with a fast break dunk. 
Walters had four more steals on the 
afternoon.
The Tartans were led by junior for
ward Michael Divens, who had fif
teen points and nine rebounds, and 
sophomore forward Clayton BarlowWilcox, with thirteen points and 
eight rebounds. Junior guard Eliot 
Goren added ten points and eight 
assists. Seth Hauben and Andy 
Larkin each had a double-double for 
the Yellow Jackets, with twenty and 
eleven points, respectively.
The lead changed hands several 
times in the second half, all the way 
to the dramatic ending in the final 
minute of play. With 43 seconds left
on the clock, Divens put Carnegie 
Mellon up 70-68 with two clutch 
free throws.
A defensive breakdown, however, 
allowed Rochesters Tim Brackney to 
hit a three pointer, giving the Yellow 
Jackets a one-point lead with 27 sec
onds left in the game.
Senior forward Matt Kaitz then 
turned the ball over on an inbounds 
pass, and had to commit the quick 
foul, putting Hauben on the line. 
After Hauben missed one of his two 
shots, Carnegie Mellon had a chance 
to take the lead or tie, but Goren 
turned the ball over with four sec
onds left.
After a quick foul and one made 
Rochester free throw, Goren took the 
rebound and quickly tried to drive 
down the court in order to shoot the 
game saving three.
He was fouled with a second left 
on the clock, and made the first free 
throw.Goren intentionally missed 
the second one, but because the ball 
did not hit the rim, possession was 
awarded to the Yellow Jackets, who 
ran out the final second of the game.
I have to trust my players to make 
plays. Usually they do, but this time 
it didnt quite work out, said Tartans 
head coach Tony Wingen.
The goal was for Eliot to hit the 
front rim and get the ball to one of 
our guards for a shot, said BarlowWilcox. It was frustrating that we 
couldnt win it for Matt, but the most 
important thing is that we know we 
can play with the best in the coun
try, he added, referring to Kaitz last 
regular-season game in a Tartans 
uniform.
Kaitz, who was honored before the 
game in a ceremony at half-court, 
finished his career in seventh place 
on Carnegie Mellons all-time scor
ing list.
Every Senior Day is hard, but 
Matt Kaitz has really embodied 
everything I want in my players, 
said Wingen. He works hard in the 
offseason, he works hard in the class
room, and hes a wonderful citizen.
Whereas Rochester is guaranteed 
an NCAA bid, the Tartans must wait 
until Monday to determine whether 
or not they receive a bid to the 
regional ECAC tournament. The 
tournament committee, made up of 
five administrators and coaches, 
selects the top eight teams in the 
region that do not get NCAA tourna
ment bids. Carnegie Mellons region 
includes the states of Pennsylvania 
and Maryland.
Who knows what is going to hap
pen on Monday? I think were good 
enough to play in this tournament, 
said Wingen. I am so proud of this 
team. In our last meeting in 
Rochester, we were really outmanned. This time we had a good 
week of preparation, and today we 
were ready. Save for a couple plays, 
we had the win.
Kaitz was optimistic, adding, We 
still have a chance to make the ECAC. 
My hope is that well have games 
next week. The truth of the matter is 
that we played our hearts out. The 
coaches and the rest of my team
mates have been great. It has been a 
great four years, though I hope its 
not over yet. This team still has good 
basketball left in it.
The Madness 
has arrived
ckays, LyCvGsos
I feel the soul of the game coming 
over me. Im not talking about that 
v rookie phenom playing professional 
basketball two hours northwest of 
here, in the city that gave us, well, 
Dennis Kucinich. (Can I get a lay-up?) 
And no, Im not talking about that 
creepy national anthem duet with 
Nona Gaye and her late father, 
Marvin, which kicked off NBA all-star 
festivities a couple of weeks ago in 
Los Angeles. Im talking about basket
ball in its purest, finest, most exciting 
form: March Madness. The Big 
Dance. The Tourney. Whatever you 
choose to call it, college basketball 
reigns supreme this time of year.
In a hypothetical conversation, the 
ever-so-eloquent Allen Iverson might 
agree: We talkin about college bas
ketball. Not the NBA. College, man. 
College. We talkin about college. Not 
the pros.
Never one to leave well enough 
alone, I decided to go for the followup question: So Allen, hows G-town 
doing this year? Note: Rest of column 
written from the intensive care unit at 
UPMC Presbyterian.
Speaking of Georgetown, lets start 
at the bottom. The Big East has been 
very disappointing this year. 
Connecticut is a good team, and 
Emeka Okafor is a great player, but 
the word that keeps popping into my 
head when I watch UConn games on 
television is underachieving. 
Syracuse hasnt been able to muster 
much after losing Carmelo Anthony, 
and frankly, lets not even get started 
about St. Johns. I could devote an 
entire column to their problems. Its 
true that Providence has been a 
bright spot in the league, and could 
very well surprise some people in the 
NCAA Tournament (i.e. win a game). 
It is also true, however, that Pitt is 
overrated. Again. Because of a gener
ally weak conference schedule, and a 
weaker non-conference schedule 
(Robert Morris, anyone?), Pitt is 
again flirting with a No. 1 seed for 
The Tourney. Expect an early round 
March Madness defeat.
The same thing applies to St. Joes 
and Stanford. If a tree falls in the for
est, and nobody hears it, does it real
ly fall? If a team goes undefeated, and 
doesnt play any good teams, are they 
really worth a damn? Renowned 
sports enthusiast Mark Twain once 
said, Reports of the ACCs demise 
have been greatly exaggerated. As 
possibly six Atlantic Coast 
Conference teams are poised to make 
a run in the NCAA Tournament this 
month, those preseason commenta
tors that said that the Big East would 
be the new dominating force in col
lege basketball will soon be eating 
their words. Under the leadership of 
coach Herb Sendek (CMU repre
sent!), N.C. State has shown the rest 
of the conference that they are for 
real, with only three ACC losses. 
Wake Forest is as strong as ever, espe
cially after winning close games this 
week against Duke and Florida State.

Men's water polo team hosts first tourney
by Adam Greenberg
Forum Editor
It's quite a different event when, 
sitting in the press box, you still get 
wet. This weekend the Carnegie 
Mellon Water Polo club (CMUWP) 
hosted its first-ever tournament in 
the main pool of the University 
Center. Created in the spring of 
2000 by water polo enthusiasts, 
former swimmers, and as an exten
sion to the intramural version still 
offered, CMUWP grew from a few 
members to having over 50 duespaying members today. In spite of 
the team's long history, having been 
recognized four years ago, the sport 
is blossoming during the 
2003-2004 season.
This is the first real organized 
year, said Jonathan Hurst, a PhD 
student and one of the team's 
founders.
In the fall, they started compet
ing with other universities club 
teams and started to plan their own 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational. On 
Saturday and Sunday, the invita
tional was their fifth competition of 
the year. With funding help from 
Student Senate and the donation of 
a clock from the Carnegie Mellon 
varsity swimming teams, they invit
ed five universities: Millersville 
University of Pennsylvania, the 
University of Pittsburgh, the 
University of Toledo, and the 
United States Military Academy 
(Army). Bloomsburg University of 
Pennsylvania was invited but was 
unfortunately unable to attend.
In the first game on Saturday, 
CMUWP faced Toledo. The game 
typified how the team would play 
the rest of the afternoon: quick 
play, particularly to start each quar
ter, and contributions from all play
ers. Despite an attempt by Toledo to 
tie the game, the closest they were 
able to come was one goal with 2 
1/2 minutes remaining in the last 
period. Carnegie Mellon won the 
game 10-8.
The next game was scheduled, 
between Millersville and the absent 
Bloomsburg, so, following a pause, 
the tournament moved on to a 
match between Pitt and the appar
ent powerhouse Army. Army man
aged to dismantle any chance Pitt 
had at a victory after only a quarter, 
eventually winning the match 
17-1.
Theyre better skill-wise than we 
are, said Mike Miles, a rare.left
hander on Carnegie Mellons team 
and a sophomore in mechanical 
engineering. ... but theyre in the 
Army; they run 10 miles a day.
Another match that afternoon 
put the fresh Millersville squad 
against CMU. Big games from 
Jonathan Lustgarten, a senior utili
ty player and the teams captain, 
and Dan Sunday, a sophomore and 
the teams organizer, helped to 
solidify their position against Ville. 
But while those two together 
accounted for five goals in the third 
quarter alone, Millersville. was able
Senior captain Jonathan Lustgarten (bottom) shoots and scores against the team from the University of Pittsburgh.
to tie before the end of regulation.
Lustgarten attributes the 
Millersville comeback partially to 
who was in the pool. At a few parts 
[of the game] the whole starting 
team subbed out, he said. The dif
ference, he said, was not that play
ers who entered the game were any 
worse athletically, but rather with
out a solid leadership structure in 
the pool.
In overtime, however, with their 
starters reinserted, they proceeded 
to dominate the game again. After 
the first half of the dual two-minute 
overtime periods, they led by four 
goals, and eventually won 19-13.
Following a few more interced
ing games, Carnegie Mellon read
ied themselves for the biggest 
match of the afternoon. They faced 
Army and had the goal of doing bet
ter than Pitt had done against 
Army. In fact, they started the game 
skillfully, scoring two of the first 
three goals and maintaining a tem
porary lead, but Armys defense 
kept them from scoring again in the 
first half. The halftime score was 
accordingly 6-2 in favor of the 
cadets.
Coming out of the break, CMU 
seemed refreshed, keeping pace 
with Army through the quarter, but 
not cutting into Armys lead. At the 
end of the third, it was 9-5 Army. 
Army capped off the scoring with a 
pair of goals in the last period to 
take the match 11-5.
The team members were quite 
pleased with this performance 
against the obvious dominating 
force of the tournament, and attrib
uted the differential not entirely to
Armys skill but partially to their 
organization.
We have the basics of offense 
and the basics of defense; it would 
be nice if we have some moves, 
said Hurst, referring to designed 
plays that Army was using.
On the second day, CMU had 
only Pitt left to face in the roundrobin tournament. They were confi
dent based on their Saturday 
records against common oppo
nents, in spite of losing two of three 
in scrimmages against the cross
town rivals.
Their aim for the match was 
defined within the first five seconds 
of play. Thats how long it took for 
the first Carnegie Mellon player to 
score. Though the Pitt goalkeeper

challengers in 
Central, West
Shafe qhaahinm
Last week, I discussed the two 
biggest teams in the AL, and possibly 
in baseball, in New York and Boston. 
While I argue that one of these two, 
probably Boston, will come out of the 
American League, there is a possibili
ty that another team in the league 
represents in the World Series.
Since the division rivals of the 
Yankees and Red Sox wont keep 
them from the playoffs, what teams 
could possibly knock these two off 
the pre-season pedestal they have 
bought their way to the top of?
There are a few contenders:
Kansas City Royals: While the addi
tion of Juan Gonzalez and Benito 
Santiago makes up for the loss of 
Raul Ibanez; the Royals are not a 
World Series contender just yet. The 
pitching, was hot last year, but this 
year well find out if the arms in the 
staff are good, or just good enough to 
win games.
I think that KC is finally going to 
challenge Minnesota for the AL 
Central title. People consistently 
underestimate the Twins, so Ill play 
along and say that the Royals bats led 
by all-star Carlos Beltran and young 
sensation Angel Berroa push KC into 
the playoffs for the first time in a long 
time. However, they should get swept 
by the Yankees in the first round; they 
just dont have the pitching to com
pete.
Minnesota Twins: The loss of closer 
Eddie Guardado highlights a slow off
season for the defending AL Central 
champs. Although their hitting 
remains strong, their pitching is not 
what it used to be, particularly late in 
the game.
In addition to Guardado, they lost 
middle relief star LaTroy Hawkins, 
and without depth in the bullpen. I 
can see Minnesota losing a lot of 
games late. Whether or not they 
defend the Central tide depends on 
the offense led by Torii Hunter and 
Shannon Stewart.^
Homegrown rookie catcher Joe 
Mauer could be a huge difference 
maker if he lives up to expectations, 
but even if the Twins take their third 
straight division title, they dont have 
the pitching to get past the first play
off round.
Anaheim Angels: The champs of 
two years ago went out and made a 
statement that theyd like to return to 
glory, and with the off-season acqui
sitions of Bartolo Colon, Kelvim 
Escobar, and baseballs best, Vladimir 
Guerrero, the Angels have a legiti
mate shot at doing just that.
If Jarrod Washburn has a season 
like he did two years ago, the pitching 
staff has a serious 1-2 threat, with 
Escobar providing a solid third start, 
but the strength of this team is the 
hitting, which rivals the AL East pow
erhouses. A lineup of Guerrero, 
Garrett Anderson, Tim Salmon, and 
Troy Glaus should scare any pitcher, 
and this team could average around 
four to five runs a game.
Because they are the best-hitting 
team in the West, look for them to 
take that division, and any 5-game 
series with either New York or Boston 
is winnable. I would not be surprised 
to see them in the ALCS with poten
tial to win it all, and I would rank 
them only slightly behind the Yanks 
and Sox.
Seattle Mariners: Not to be out
done by their SoCal counterparts, the 
Emerald City has loaded up another 
talented team. Stealing Eddie 
Guardado from Minnesota solidifies 
their bullpen, and signing Raul 
Ibanez and Rich Aurilla gives them a 
threatening lineup. Starting off with 
Ichiro, then Brett Boone, Ibanez, 
Aurilla, Scott Spezio, John Olerud, 
and Edgar Martinez this team can 
definitely hit.
If Freddie Garcia can figure out 
how to pitch like he did two years 
ago, the staff is going to be strong as 
well, with Gill Meche and Jamie 
Moyer looking to have strong sea
sons. This team will put pressure on 
New York and Boston to win the AL 
Wildcard, and could come up with it 
if either of those teams slips. While all 
the hype is surrounding the East, I 
could see both Anaheim and Seattle 
making the post-season.
Oakland As: Finally, the As, the 
team which consistently loses great 
hitters and manages to find new 
ones. Eric Chavez and Jermaine Dye 
are solid hitters, but they alone can
not carry the offense. But, of course, 
the As have arguably the best staff in 
baseball led by the triumvirate of Tim 
Hudson, Mark Mulder, and Barry 
Zito.
The staff got even stronger with the 
addition of Mark Redman from the

Speak up and be heard
Mudge House hosts singers, poets, and more
The pink lighting, casual and compact setting, 
and comfy chairs made Mudge Houses piano 
lounge a rather pleasant venue last Tuesday at 
Open Mic Night. The night was an opportunity 
for students to come and perform musical or 
poetic pieces, or basically do anything that fits 
hence the idea of open mic - anyone is allowed 
to come up and perform without being pre-registered. Though the cookies and chocolate milk 
outside the door were inviting, the stacks of 
boxes, presumably left by AB Tech, as well as the 
height of the chairs prevented the audience from 
seeing most of the stage. After a few checks to 
lights and sound, the show began at last.
Kaitlin Fague, a sophomore in chemistry, per
formed a very peppy tap dance with quick steps 
and a bright smile. The most disappointing part 
about her performance was the lack of visibility 
from anywhere but the front row. Her piece was 
also impressive because it was not even set to 
music; she kept time merely by her steps.
One of the few non-musical acts of the night 
came from Eugene Hsia, a first-year in H&SS. He 
elected to perform a monologue from Good Will 
Hunting - a well known part of the film in which 
Matt Damon rejects a job offer. Shiu pulled off 
this monologue, a challenging piece that 
required speedy speech and hefty memoriza
tion, with only a few hitches. The passages 
humor remained clear and Shiu got laughs in the 
same way that Damon did in the film.
The audience seemed full of energy and pre
pared to have fun; shouts from the crowd gave 
the impression that everyone knew one another. 
From a few of the jokes bantered between per
formers and viewers, it seemed that everyone in 
attendance lived in Mudge, even though Open 
Mic Night was not exclusive to people living at 
the house. It seems that the night would have 
been even better if more people were aware that 
it was going on.
One of the most accomplished acts of the per
formance was by Jeannie Choi, a senior English 
major who played a piano piece she wrote and 
who had performed at several Mudge Open Mic 
Nights in the past.
She declared, I thought this would be cool....
I came full circle, referring to the fact that this 
was her final performance at the Open Mic 
Night, and she was performing the same song 
she had done at her first. Her song, A Little 
More, was rendered beautifully with powerful 
lyrics complemented by her strong voice.
Evan Sundwick/Pillbox Co-Editor
Takaaki Agawa and Coleman Rusnock cover the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers hit Under the Bridge.
Another equally pleasing performer was Adam 
Edison, a first-year in CIT, who covered two 
blues pieces and also sang a self-composed song 
bemoaning his love life entitled, Why? (as in 
Why am I single?). His cover of Fire and 
Rain, originally by James Taylor, maintained 
the sound Taylor created; Edisons piano work 
was flawless on this, as well as all of his other 
pieces.
Edison was performing for his first Open Mic 
Night, but he seemed rather confident in the 
public eye. In reference to his song Why? he 
mentioned, It is exciting performing it on the 
piano I made it up on. Perhaps this is why he 
seemed so at ease.
Open Mic Night at Mudge had plenty of ener
getic students - some read poetry full of rage, 
others sang familiar pieces along with their own 
creations, but all seemed comfortable in the 
small, welcoming Mudge piano lounge. The 
night closed on a somewhat humorous note, and 
students milled around just as they had at the 
nights opening, exchanging pleasantries and 
probably thoroughly satisfied with the diverse 
performances of the night.

Small towns, big plans
Students documentary examines Americas tiny towns
It was like going back in time, thought Michael 
Gutenplan and Benjamin Loving when they reached 
the first town. Though it wasnt Gutenplans first time 
behind the camera, capturing small-town life across 
the country was a new experience for the Carnegie 
Mellon University seniors. While learning firsthand 
how to handle the financial concerns and artistic con
tent of a film, the student filmmakers were coming 
into contact with a world they thought had all but dis
appeared. The resulting documentary, All-American 
Road Trip: Searching for America, should be finished 
sometime this month, and on March 3, Gutenplan will 
lead a Soup and Substance lecture on how to produce 
a student film.
Gutenplan, a drama major, has worked in the enter
tainment industry as much as time would allow dur
ing college, and has been producing film projects of 
his own for several years. His small-town America 
project started as an idea for a film about dying pro
fessions  blacksmiths, cowboys, and the like. After 
talking it over with his mentor, dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy, Gutenplan realized that small-town 
America was at the heart of his questions about 
changes in the American way of life. Murphy loved the 
idea, and agreed to provide $2000 for shooting 
expenses through the school.
This is quintessential Gutenplan, said Murphy. 
He simply came forward with good ideas, good ways 
to cut his costs, and compelling arguments for the 
funding he needed. It is important for us to fund pro
grams and initiatives such as these, and that commit
ment is bolstered, certainly, by student success in such 
endeavors.
Murphy also helped Gutenplan realize why certain 
parts of our heritage and values are becoming scarce 
in metropolitan environments.
I call it the mailing of America,  said Gutenplan. 
Suburban sprawl has overtaken the American small 
town and homogenized everything, he said, and the 
purpose of this film was to capture what made indi
vidual places special.
For help with getting started, Gutenplan turned to 
Benjamin Loving, his fraternity brother at AEPi. 
Loving, a mathematical sciences/computer science 
major who would become his associate producer, 
cameraman, and catch-all partner in crime. The pair 
arranged free hotels, equipment and other necessities
 once they explained what they were doing, people 
were more than happy to help, said Gutenplan.
They began the trip in Los Angeles, once Gutenplan 
had finished his internship there. On August 8, 
Gutenplan and Loving posed in front of the 
Hollywood sign, then set off for Bishop, Calif., the first 
town on their itinerary. The pair would drive until

they hit another dot on the map, where they sought 
out local businesses, culture, landmarks, and most 
importantly, townspeople. Gutenplan would 
approach interview subjects with a consent form 
while Loving handled the camera. By the end of the 
summer, the two crossed the country in an almost per
fect horizontal line, landing back in Pittsburgh in time 
for class. But after another meeting with Murphy, 
Gutenplan was back in the car, this time to look for 
more geographic and human diversity. Before school 
started, he set off to explore the Northeast, including 
Pittsburghs Bloomfield, and traveled the South dur
ing winter break, after returning from a semester 
abroad in London. By the end of filming in midJanuary, they had captured 27 towns, said Gutenplan, 
but had visited close to 60, some of which were sug
gestions from interview subjects.
In Cody, Wyo., most of the 9000 residents structure 
each fiscal year around the summer, when an average 
of 450,000 people pass through on their way to and 
from the east gate of Yellowstone National Park. 
Founded by Buffalo Bill Cody, the town boasts a histo
ry studded with big names, the worlds largest collec
tion of American firearms, and one of the most exten
sive collections of Old West artifacts in the world.
But small businesses play a major role in the towns 
economy even when city folk arent clogging the 
streets, said resident Margie Johnson. Johnson owns
Cody Trolley Tours  during her popular one-hour 
ride, Gutenplan and Loving chatted with their fellow 
sight-seers, an elderly tour group called The Rascals.
Were a very entrepreneurial town, she said. We 
take the Western way of life, and we use it. We have 
horse shows and all those kinds of events.
In small college towns like Tuskeegee, Ala., home of 
Tuskeegee University, college students mingle with an 
aging population, bringing a change of pace to the 
towns economic and cultural life.
When we talked to [vice president of Tuskeegee, 
Ala., Chamber of Commerce Charles Thompson], he 
said that about half of the town is older people who 
want a slower pace; the other half is college kids who 
want change, like they see on TV, said Loving. Part 
of [the towns] problem is creating that change while 
at the same time preserving what they have.
Historically, though the university and the small 
town have always worked well, few young people stay 
in town after they graduate, said Thompson.
Big is in, said Thompson. Supersize your meals, 
big towns, big corporations, big, big, big. But what 
made America great was the fact that when people 
came here, they were running away from big 
things.... I think small towns are going to be that

anchor that people are going to be able to hold onto 
and come back to, to get America back on its keel 
again.
As Gutenplan explores avenues for screening, 
broadcast, and distribution, he hopes he can work 
within the system to effect a greater change. His own 
company, Close-Up Productions, may seek distribu
tion with a friends larger production company. 
Gutenplans ultimate goal is an airing on WQED-TV, 
and as soon as editing is done, he will send a copy to 
the channels director of programming, Chris 
Fennimore. To be suitable for WQED, the film must 
have sufficient production quality, said Fennimore, 
but also a human touch.
Its not rocket science, said Fennimore. When
you make a documentary, youre looking for some
thing interesting. When you include people and try 
to make the story universal, as Gutenplan and Loving 
are doing, youre on the right track, he said.
Meanwhile, Gutenplan and Loving are spending 
late nights sifting through 17 hours of footage, trying 
to decide on the final format of the film. They could 
go with a roadtrip format, a chronological treatment 
of their travels, said Loving, or they could try to organ
ize thematically, turning the footage into an essay. For 
this task, Gutenplan has also enlisted the help of sen
ior philosophy and English major Dana Vinson, his 
classmate in a screenwriting class; when the final 
form of the film is Headed, her job will be to weave a 
narrative out of all the interviews.
I think the project they've undertaken is large, but 
the message is so important, said Vinson. I think for 
many of us who are now coming into adulthood, 
we've grown up struggling with the idea of what 
America is.... I consider myself to be from a small 
town, but we still have all the fixings of a suburban 
supercenter  a Gap, a Target, etc. This documentary 
is really a journey to try and rediscover the towns, 
people, and ideas that made America what it is.

Village Idiot:
Live music by this student band pleased Skibo diners
If you havent already, go check out Skibo 
Coffeehouses weekly Wednesday night concerts at 8 
pm. You wont be disappointed. With decent acoustics 
and a small stage accompanied by the well-worn, 
overstuffed navy couches, its a good place to bring 
your laptop and program along with the unique tal
ent, or to eat a late dinner with your buddies.
This weeks performance showcased a four-piece 
band called Village Idiot, which crooned out soulful 
mellow tunes that went just right with a sip of Skibos 
vanilla nut coffee. This acoustic group seemed to be 
made for a coffeehouse as they churned out fan 
faves and sing-alongs. Popular covers, such as 
Fleetwood Macs Landslide and Didos Here with 
Me, filled up their set list and kept the audiences 
keen interest.
With 14 songs in total, the concert went for a little 
over an hour, but people came in and out of the cof
feehouse as they pleased. Most audience members 
crowded the back half of the room closest to the stage 
and stayed glued to their seats throughout the whole 
set.
The interplay of the two vocalists switched from low 
and high parts skillfully and showcased each singers 
adept abilities. They seemed very comfortable playing 
with each other and the groups light-hearted nature 
made the venue feel easygoing and uplifting, despite 
all the sad, lonesome songs.
The lead singer, Joanna Lovering, senior BHA in 
drama, directing, and psychology, had a clear-pitched 
voice that drew the listener in. Her voice dripped with 
melancholy as each song was presented with a 
mournful sorrowful undertone that made the listen
ers heart wrench to even Sarah MacLachlans Ice 
Cream Song.
The other members of Village Idiot include lead gui
tarist Carsen Kline, a graduate student working for
Janet Park/Staffwriter
Joanna Lovering (vocal), Carsen Kline (guitar), Jeannie Choi (vocal) playing at Skibo (Not pictured: Christopher Stratis, on percussion)
the ECE Department; percussionist Christopher 
Stratis, a grad student in the business school, and 
backup vocalist Jeannie Choi, a senior in English.
Other songs included pieces from the Indigo Girls, 
Third Day, the Beatles, Radiohead, the Eagles, and the 
Grateful Dead. Village Idiot is derived from the band 
Idiot Boyfriend. Its half of Idiot Boyfriend, com
mented Lovering.
Its the acoustic version of Idiot Boyfriend, added 
Choi. Village Idiot is actually Idiot Boyfriend sans the 
bassist.
Happy about their debut performance, Village Idiot 
plans to perform at least one more show. They are 
scheduled to play during the Spring Carnival Concert 
and again in Skibo Coffeehouse. Their influences 
include top 40 rock hits from the 70s and 80s, clas
sic rock, modern folk, and pop, listed Kline.
As the evening wound down, the sets last song sur
prisingly featured Choi playing a solo performance, 
guitar and all, with her rendition of Cyndi Laupers 
Time After Time. But the show was not over  
Lovering jumped at the hint of an encore, and the 
band was on stage again to finish up with 10,000 
Maniacs These are the Days. The audience enthusi
astically clapped along with the bongos on this piece, 
reflecting the brightness that Village Idiot exudes 
with their playing, a good compliment to the campus 
music scene.

David in Wonderland
An eclectic mix of office humor and solemnity
David W. Jacobsens Cubicle Wonderland puts 
the listener in a real dilemma: do you treat it as 
a humor album, or do you take it seriously?
Its a problem that never quite gets resolved. 
In Cubicle Wonderland, Jacobsen, a New York 
guitarist, singer, and songwriter who has been 
performing and recording for over 10 years, has 
actually combined two albums into one. The 
first half of the CD is titled Cubicle in th Sky; 
Excerpts from Cubicle: The Musical. Mr. 
Jacobsens unfinished musical consists of eight 
tracks that reflect on the drudgery of working in 
the corporate world, and can be very clever and 
insightful. His style ranges from funk in the 
opener Another Day, Another Dollar to coun
try in Cubicle Cowboy and Reorganization 
Time.
In Cubicle in the Sky, the instrumentals take 
second fiddle to the biting lyrics and funny 
delivery: I cant remember the melody to the 
scathing Proper Work Ethic, but I do remem
ber the chorus: Screw your job 
before your job screws
you/Laugh at your boss, 
cause theyre screwing him 
too.
In Great Cubicle in 
the Sky, Jacobsen 
mourns, Even when 
you die, youll still commute 
every single day to that cubicle 
in the sky. He then describes 
Jesus and Mohammed attempt
ing to cut a business merger in 
heaven until Buddha steps in with a better 
deal. One thing is for sure; there is no shortage 
of cynicism in Cubicle. It would be the perfect 
soundtrack to the film Office Space, if that movie 
didnt have an amazing soundtrack already.
The first half of the CD fares well, simply
because Jacobsens a pretty funny guy. His take
on the corporate ladder isnt exactly original, 
but it offers some laugh-out-loud moments. The 
listener is, at this point, primed for a subtle, 
focused humor album. Unfortunately, thats not 
what they get.
The second section of the CD, titled 
Wonderland Fades, focuses more on musician
ship and less on material, with mixed results. 
Certainly, Jacobsen is able to show off his skill 
as a guitarist in these later tracks. The all-toobrief Watching the Sunrise When You Havent 
Slept and All Stops to Dover are wellarranged and very pretty, and Allison, borrowing from Latin and jazz 
influences, is the best 
song on the album.
However, these 
songs are, for 
the most part, 
played straight, 
without any of 
the tongue-in-cheek 
humor that made Cubicle in the 
Sky fun. There are a few refrains 
from Cubicle nicely placed 
throughout songs such as Every 
Suburb, Every Strip Mall, which laments the 
same sort of middle-class disillusionment that 
Another Day, Another Dollar does.
There is also a quick, goofy ragtime piece 
called I.N.A.S.A.I.L. (which stands for Im 
Not As Stupid As I Look). Overall, however, 
everything in Wonderland feels like its being 
taken too seriously.
Jacobsens vocals also feel misused in 
Wonderland Fades. In Cubicle, his offbeat voice 
and exaggerated tone make his lyrics even funnier. 
In Wonderland he tones down his freer musical 
style to deal with more serious subjects, but doesnt 
make the same impact. Instead, he ends up sounding a 
little too much like hes trying to emulate James 
Taylor, and plays with his pronunciation so much its 
sometimes hard to tell what hes saying.
At the end of Wonderland Fades, there is a bonus 
track that harks back to the earlier Cubicle, where 
Jacobsen rails at his theoretical boss and announces 
hes quitting. It seems to be intended as a resolution to 
the misery projected in Cubicle and offers a nice 
wrap-up to the CD, but never reaches the same 
momentum that the earlier songs did.
David W. Jacobsen is one of those independent 
artists that forms the bastion of the litde-known New 
York underground music scene, and his dedication to 
his craft is admirable. Unless you like jarring contrasts 
in style, however, I would recommend listening to the 
two halves of this CD separately and let the mans skills 
speak for themselves.

Guster rocks Laga
Clubs final days lit up by energetic rock
Opening alt rock/emo band Graham Cole walked 
off into the dim backstage of Club Laga last Tuesday 
night amidst enthusiastic applause. The lights came 
on and the rare sold-out crowd gradually packed in 
toward the stage in anticipation of the main act to fol
low. People casually watched the crew prepare the 
stage until the lights began to dim and Gerry 
Raffertys Baker Street came on over the sound sys
tem. Guster strode on stage about to perform a won
derful show.
The Somerville, Mass. band showcased their wide 
array of talent, creativity, and instrumental range of 
from the first note of their opening Careful until the 
final chord of the entirely acoustic performance of 
Jesus Over the Radio, (their final encore song).
Our manager came up to us right before the show 
and said that tonights crowd was feisty, Ryan Miller, 
lead vocalist and guitarist, quipped to his fervent audi
ence. Im not too sure what that means, but it sounds 
like a good thing.
And the feisty nature of Gusters fan base was evi
dent as they were playfully pelted with ping-pong 
balls at the climactic finish of Airport Song, as well 
as when they goaded the band onto playing their 
inventive Channukah-themed introduction to What
You Wish For.
The listeners energy was more than matched by 
Gusters performance as drummer Brian Rosenworcel 
exhibited through many of his highly animated, signa
ture stick-less solos in songs like Center of Attention 
and Demons. Adam Gardner provided the lead gui
tar and harmonized with Miller on Diane among 
many others even taking the lead for Barrel of a Gun 
and Happier while interacting with fans and main
taining a powerful stage presence.
A roadie even let his hair down and fittingly con
tributed his lengthy mane, rocking with Guster in 
their exceptional rendition of the throwback 
Scorpions hit Rock You Like a Hurricane.
That was the last song of our set but were not 
going to get off the stage and leave you with a mystery 
of what were doing back there before we return, 
Miller said. Instead were going to leave all the mys
tery in the hands of Brian [Rosenworcel]. If you make 
him want to come back out here then he will. 
Otherwise, well just play without drums.
After Rosenworcel had disappeared in a room 
behind the stage, the lead singer silenced the ram
bunctious crowd.
Quiet down, everyone, Miller implored teasingly. 
Lets see if hell still come back without cheering. 
The drummer did return, however, and was met with 
light-hearted chuckles, receiving a deserved ovation 
until the encore began.
Once it was underway, Guster continued its nearly 
flawless performance with the only disappointment 
being the concert's inevitable end. The finale, though, 
only further displayed Gusters ability and presence as 
they unplugged their instruments, abandoned their 
microphones, and lined up with one another on the 
stages edge to play.
Although Jesus Over the Radio was overwhelm
ingly lauded, the concert ended on a bittersweet note 
as Miller pointed out a sad coincidence, that the past 
three venues they played at in Pittsburgh have been 
closed or will be shortly.
As the fans herded toward the exits they were left 
with a mixed set of emotions for the quickly approach
ing loss of a beloved venue but overwhelming grati
tude for another unforgettable event.

god forbids new album ups the bar
Three years have passed since god forbids last fulllength was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. In 
an uncertain time, when unspeakable rage would 
build up inside the collective belly of this country, 
when radio stations and MTV would censor them
selves hoping to quell that fury, or at least to ignore it, 
there stood a band and an album that serves as a tes
tament to the people of America.
Determination, to stand tall, to smash weak think
ing and corresponding cowardice; this is the American 
spirit, and in my opinion god forbid is Americas band. 
Where else would you find a metal band that is 4/5 
African-American with technical chops to match their 
European counterparts, and unbridled fury to blow 
them away?
The band almost self-destructed after years of con
tinuous touring but emerged stronger than before. A 
band that released a genre-defining album, only to fol
low it up with a completely re-tooled approach to 
metal-core, finds themselves once again at the fore
front of metal itself.
meltdown these guys had, it is a thing of beauty. 
Picking up where the last one left off, g.f. mixes 80s 
thrash with brutal chuggah-chuggah hardcore stomp. 
A little harmony reminiscent of Dirt-era Alice in 
Chains can be found here and there, and it works.
These melodic meanderings intertwine beautifully 
with the squealing solos that come out of the guitars 
of the brothers Coyle (Doc and Dallas.) They stand out 
even more so when juxtaposed with Byron Davis gutteral screams. Case in point is Anti-Hero, the second 
track: the first 60 seconds are straight up g.f, then a 
tease of a solo reminiscent of Randy Rhoads, then 
back to the destruction, only to have more Doc ala 
Randy/Eddie V, then back to the stomp, all in four

Production-wise, the mix is a little greyer and gritti

Carnegie Mellon Escort
Taking the long trip home so you dont have to
Youve just finished your (insert big project/home
work here), its two in the morning, youre tired, and 
its a long trek home which youd rather not walk 
alone. Too far for Safewalk and reluctant to spend a 
night on a couch in the lounge  who knows whats 
been done on those things  your only option is 
Escort.
Escort is one of several options CMU students rely 
on to get home safely from a long day of working in 
the lab, studio, or cluster. Running from 6:30 pm to 
6:30 am, Escort is truly the night owls weapon of 
choice for getting home within 1.5 miles of campus.
Students riding home can take the opportunity to 
start unwinding from a long day by listening to music 
or chatting with other travelers and the drivers, who 
are usually more than happy to discuss the days 
events.
Usually operating two vans, they cover routes going 
to North Oakland/Shadyside and Squirrel Hill with an 
occasional third van taking up overflow from the first 
two. Escort drivers deal with the more dangerous half 
of the day, facing treacherous black ice, blinding bliz
zards, drunken Pitt students, overflowing vans, and 
the constant, impatient demands of a caffeine-driven 
student body.
According to a soon-to-be-published interdiscipli
nary class project in EPP, SDS, and the Heinz School, 
over 90% of students surveyed have heard of Escort. 
The project, supervised by EPP professor Edward 
Rubin, focused on personal safety on campus, looking 
at factors such as FBI statistics, exterior lighting, and 
security cameras while devoting an entire section to 
Escort. According to University Police Chief Creig 
Doyle, the report also reveals a higher awareness of 
campus safety features among female students.
Kathleen Madonna, assistant director of Annual 
Giving and Director of Telemarketing, and Heather 
Wells, a junior in drama, both use Escort as a way of 
getting home safe in the wee hours of the night.
Without Escort Id probably be dead, said 
Madonna, adding that One of her concerns was the 
danger associated with traveling on Beeler Street at 
the times she goes home. Students also appreciate 
Escort for giving them the freedom to utilize campus 
facilities for their work at odd hours.
While traversing Pittsburghs streets at night may 
not necessarily be a lethal affair, it may be a pungent 
one.
[There are] lots of smelly people.... I couldnt get 
my homework done without Escort, said Wells. This 
appreciation is especially true of students working in
the International Networking Institute, who use 
Escort almost exclusively to get home at all hours of 
the night.
Escorts main strength is not in their cell phones, CB 
radio, or their nondescript white vans, but its drivers. 
Bob Peace, an Escort driver from 6:30 pm to 2:30 am 
Monday through Friday, is best known to students as 
the driver who knows where kids live. Peace esti
mates that he has memorized about 150 destinations, 
mostly in Squirrel Hill with some in Shadyside. Peace 
empathized with students, saying they want to do 
what everyone else wants to do  earn a decent living, 
an undertaking in which CMU plays a large role.
If you keep [students] happy, theyll want to 
learn.... Escort is for hard-working students, not for 
trips to McDonalds.... By the time they get to you, 
theyre tired and want to get home as soon as possi
ble. .
Peace said the biggest day-to-day problems on the 
job are the same that other drivers have: meeting 
demand and dealing with the occasional inebriated 
student. During their busiest trips, Escort vans take on 
up to 13 seated students. Although Doyle discourages 
drivers from taking on more students than they have 
seats  the extras manage to find a place to stand 
within the van  Peace and the others hate to leave 
them standing on the side of the road, especially when 
the weather is threatening.
The other complaint brings to mind some of the 
most interesting times to ride Escort. One such time, 
Halloween, is one of the biggest party nights here at 
CMU. One Halloween, drivers dealt with at least one 
group of girls requesting to be taken to Pitts campus.
The girls approached a driver and he asked them 
what school they were from. When they responded 
that they were from Pitt, the driver expressed his 
regret that he could not take them anywhere and 
drove off despite the cajoling of the small, rambunc
tious crowd.
Although students might think of Escort as being an 
independent arm of the University, it actually operates 
under the auspices of Campus Police and Doyles over
all command.
Officers treat us like one of them.... [Its] great 
cause they dont have to do that, said Andre 
Copeland, an Escort driver from 8 pm to 4 am Monday 
through Friday.
Also, Escort hasnt always been operated by full
time employees. According to Doyle, the University 
stopped hiring students through the work-study pro
gram about six years ago. Those involved with Escort

operation.
think the change is largely responsible for the increase 
in reliability, which caused the services popularity to 
rise as well.
According to Peace, when he started his route six 
years ago, he was driving 25 people and driving 30 to 
40 miles during his shift. Peace, a certified state 
inspection mechanic, commented that it has grown 
unbelievably, and now regularly drives 110 miles a 
night while talking with students and other drivers 
about car repair. He said he likes to make sure people 
dont get taken for a ride by dishonest mechanics. 
Peace also attributed the rise in his routes popularity 
to cuts Port Authority Transit has made in Squirrel Hill 
bus routes. Escort has been able to fill the gap and 
keep up with demand so far.
However, according to Doyle, the Universitys risk 
management department is mandating a change from 
15-passenger vans to 13-passenger models due to an 
unacceptably high rate of rollover incidents for the 
bigger vans.
The new vans will all have driver-operated doors 
(think: school buses), which both Peace and Copeland 
prefer to student-operated side doors, which are often 
closed improperly. However, he also fears that the 
costly new vans the University is considering  mod
els Doyle is looking at are priced between $47,000 to

Doyle said that the new vans would be about the 
same size with fewer seats and a raised roof, recog
nizing the need for the new vehicles to be as nimble as 
the ones used now. There will also be one handi
capped-accessible van, which can be called on 24 
hours before its needed by handicapped patrons. 
Doyle said that the new vans will also be powered by 
compressed natural gas as part of the Universitys 
effort to incorporate green practices in campus opera
tions.
that he didnt come because the bus was full, and that 
hed be there at 1:10 am. He came at 1:15 am, said 
Holwill. However, I had another experience where I 
rang at 3 am and the bus picked me up right away. My 
experiences with Escort have made me less inclined to 
use the service, but it is still preferable to walking 
alone at night.
Some drivers find it necessary to brace themselves 
before hitting the streets to shuffle students around 
the Burgh. You have to love this job to come here 
every day, said Copeland. Before I come to work, I 
meditate.... You need clarity of mind to work here.
One feature of Escort students take advantage of is 
the requisition of cell phones for each of the vans run
ning routes, especially after 2:30 am when the service 
switches from making regular rounds to operating in 
an on-demand mode.
Thick accents and noisy roads make the system less 
than ideal, but Doyle estimates that it has reduced 
undesirable workload on Campus Police dispatchers 
by 40-60 percent since it was introduced in fall 2002. 
Doyle said this system allows them to concentrate on 
being available to answer the emergency line. 
Students can call 412.268.RIDE to get the numbers for 
the individual vans and general Escort information.
In a marriage of high technology and student con
venience, Escort vans may soon be installed with GPS 
systemsDoyle has expressed interest in the idea and 
says that there is a strong possibility there could be a 
pilot program to test the effectiveness and popularity 
of the system.
More than simple chauffeurs, Escort drivers are 
agents of observation, using their contact with 
University students to come up with new ways the 
school could better serve its students. During his 
rounds, Copeland spoke of an outreach effort hed like 
to see from the University to foreign CMU students.
Id like to see CMU show them their neighborhood 
... [and] increase their awareness of their surround
ings, said Copeland.
He elaborated, observing that foreign students tend 
to lead rather secluded lives, depriving themselves of 
knowing the streets and the neighborhood at large 
that surrounds their homes.
Oakland is sometimes a predator spot, said 
Copeland. They know that the kids here are from 
other places. He added that cocaine addicts some
times wander down Centre Avenue, which is a com
mon destination for students taking Escort.

When I came to CMU, I definitely thought about 
safety when walking to my apartment. It was a new, 
foreign place, and I was unsure of how dangerous the 
area is, especially at night, said Juliet Holwill, a sen

lot fewer people around then. I was also approached 
by a man begging for money one night, so since then I 
have been more cautious about walking by myself.
While Escorts operations are well-defined and 
manned by full-time staff, there are unpredictable 
delays and gaps in service that occur on occasion. 
Escort is like an engine.... [Were] always fine-tuning 
it, said Doyle.
I have had mixed experiences with Escort.... One 
night I rang for the Escort and the driver said hed pick 
me up at 12:35 am. At 12:55 he hadnt arrived, so I 
went back inside and called again. The driver said
Except for a few years in Las Vegas, Copeland has

and that the majority of his problems come from deal

... out of duty.
According to the Shuttle/Escort Schedule, Escort 
runs for all but nine days of the year, including the 
summer months. It also takes students between offcampus, University-owned buildings. Whether its to 
parties, home, or school, CMU students value Escort 
as a crucial service to the campus community.

The Academy Awards
Return of the King takes the crown
Hollywood slipped into its finery and onto the red 
carpet for the 76th Academy Awards last night. This 
year, Billy Crystal hosted once again. This was the 
eighth year that Crystal has served as host. Crystals 
routine was a bit hackneyed and weary, leading one to 
question if there should be a limit on the number of 
times one person can host. It has been the year of the 
comedy. The Academy often turns up its nose at 
humor in favor of pathos. This year, we had a little of 
both. Pirates of the Caribbean, Lost in Translation, 
American Splendor and Somethings Got to Give, among 
others, have all received Oscar nods.
The style of the Oscars was bright and colorful. The 
art for the Oscars banners, posters, and invitations, 
created by Carnegie Mellon graduate Burton Morris, 
dragged the Awards kicking and screaming into the 
modern era with its distinctive and playful pop art 
style.
Unlike last years ?ceremony, which maintained a 
solemn tone under the long shadow of the war, this 
year was more lively and playful. A few people even 
had the gall to make a few political jokes. So much 
has changed, said Crystal, The first time I hosted, 
Bush was in the White House, the economy was in the 
toilet, and we had just had a war with Iraq!
Tim Robbins took home the Oscar for Best 
Supporting Actor for his role in Mystic River, but did 
not use the podium as a soapbox for political state
ments. Errol Morris, however, after winning the Best 
Documentary Oscar for his film The Fog of War, used 
the opportunity to compare the current conflict with 
Iraq to the Vietnam War. His observation drew 
applause from the audience.
The big winner of the night was The Return of the 
King, which won in every category in which it was 
nominated. It received a total of eleven Oscars, tying 
with Titanic and Ben Hur for the most awards ever 
received. It received the coveted awards for Best Art 
Direction, Costumes, Makeup, Visual Effects, and Best 
Picture. Peter Jackson, who spent the past seven years 
of his life working on the trilogy, won an Oscar for Best 
Director. The Academy has pretty much overlooked 
LOTR for the past two years, undoubtedly biding their 
time for the last film. LOTR is the second trilogy, after 
Francis Ford Coppolas Godfather epic, to reap Best 
Picture nominations for each installment. Its a shame 
that Godfather III wasnt as good as the Return of the 
King. Years of filming, a budget of $300 million dollars 
and an almost religiously devoted crew of over two 
thousand people signify how much work went into this 
epic.
While Return of the Kings sweep was not terribly 
surprising, there was some tension lurking in the Best 
Actor Category. Sean Penn won for his portrayal of a
uourtesy or New Line uinema
Lord of the Rings final installment, The Return of the King, was as victorious on the battlefield as the heroes of the film.
and Catherine OHara of The Kiss at the End of the 
Rainbow from A Mighty Wind. In a lighter moment, 
Jack Black and Will Ferrell sang a duet, making up 
words to the song that the orchestra plays when a 
recipients speech goes on too long. Annie Lennoxs 
song Into the West from Return of the King took the 
Oscar. Return of the King also won for Best Original 
Score.
Sofia Coppola, who lost in both the Best Picture and 
Best Director categories, received an Oscar for Best 
Original Screenplay. This was the only category in 
which she did not have to compete with Return of the 
King, which, not surprisingly, took an Oscar for the 
Best Adapted Screenplay. She appeared on stage with 
her father, director Francis Ford Coppola.
This years Academy Awards were not as full of sur
prises as some years have been, as Return of the King 
had been favored in many categories. Many will likely 
feel that this honor was deserved by the film, but oth
ers will wish that there was more variety in the films 
which received awards.

The Passion of the Christ
A controversial film that should not be missed
Perhaps there has never been a movie more hotly 
debated even before its general release as Mel 
Gibsons The Passion of the Christ. Some have been 
calling it the best thing ever made while others have 
been accusing the director of creating the biggest 
piece of anti-Semitic propaganda since Nazi Germany 
in the 1930s.
Say what you may about his motivations, but it 
remains that Gibson has succeeded in creating one of 
the great epic movies of our time, a cinematic master
piece capable of drawing out the emotions of even the 
most jaded person.
The Passion is brutally violent, depicting the torture 
and death of Jesus in the most graphic way possible. 
Prolonged scenes show lashings and scourgings with 
dripping pools of blood and flying chunks of flesh.
The continual whippings that Jesus endures are 
enough to turn most any stomach; throughout, the 
tearing of flesh and crunching of bones use Dolby 
Digital to its full effect.
The movie begins after the Last Supper, with Jesus 
praying in the Garden of Gethsemane. Almost from 
the beginning, James Caviezels portrayal of Jesus 
temptation by the devil is nothing short of amazing. 
He manages to express the suffering and pain that 
Jesus endured with brilliant realism, almost singlehandedly turning the movie from just another film 
into a total experience.
Some of the other performances lack the same 
depth: Hristo Shopov as Pilate is a bit waffly and 
entirely too sympathetic of a character, and Luca 
Lionellos Judas character is weak and thrown aside 
enough to de-emphasize the importance of Judas 
betraying Jesus.
Additionally, the depiction of Satan (Rosalinda 
Celentano) is a bit questionable; Gibson took clear 
artistic license, and while the androgynous form that 
appears in the movie is sufficiently disturbing, it casts 
a bit of an eerie, fantasy spin on something that is oth
erwise very real. Celentano does seem a bit out of 
place, but any director would have to portray this sub
Pittpunk Showcase
Crowds the already crowded Quiet Storm
The Pittpunk Showcase had four bands on their line
up Saturday night: Unarmed, Better Off Dead, Sixty 
Four, and Tabula Rasa. The performance was at the 
Quiet Storm, a quaint caf in Friendship, known for 
their iced tea and soup, vegan Monday dinners, and 
Tuesday night dinner club meals.
Audience members were greeted by a smiling door
man with a wad of bills in his hand, who happily took 
the door charge and handed each guest a hand 
scrawled homemade CD sampler of four Unarmed 
songs and a leaflet promoting Sixty Fours upcoming 
EP debut.
Although handicapped with lousy acoustics at the 
Quiet Storm, the venue books local talent every week
end to utilize the makeshift stage in the back that is 
already crowded with sofas and tables. However, not 
being able to hear the higher notes of the guitar and 
vocals melodies is a small price to pay for experiencing 
the different shades of local Pittsburgh rockers.
Better Off Dead, a screamo/hardcore four-piece 
band, made sure the vocals were clearly heard as the 
lead singer ran frantically back and forth on stage per
forming his throat out. They played songs from their 
EP, including Four Words, and Days of Friendship 
Faded. The little guitar chords rang out clear and 
melodic, while the head-banging drummer seemed to 
play with his eyes covered by his long swinging hair.
The show was acrobatic with deftly-timed fly kicks 
and swinging microphones. In the last song, the vocal
ist dragged a chair on stage and danced around the 
overturned prop. The emcee described the unexpect
ed feat as, very neo-valiant and went on to tell a few 
jokes before introducing the next band, Sixty Four.
Sixty Four is a recently signed band on Pittpunks 
new label. Described as a local power-pop band by 
Pittpunk, this band featured younger faces and a 
makeshift bass-drum cover with a painted on logo. 
Dressed in matching black-collared dress shirts, they 
belted out tunes with hints of Jimmy Eat World and 
pop punk elements. The guitar was heavily distorted 
with repetitive chord progressions and systematic 
bland beats.
Tabula Rasa was the highlight of the night as the 
audience cheered heartily after being introduced. The 
bands sound is post-punk and indie accentuated with 
brisk drumbeats and progressive melodies. They 
seemed to have a professional edge over the other 
bands, as they moved around with rock-star flair. They 
had cleanly timed breaks and well-tuned transitions. 
The band has toured with Anti-Flag, A Static Lullaby, 
Darkest Hour, and The Vacancy.
The lead singer Rob Spagiare and rhythm guitarist 
Andrew Grossmann are both graduates of Carnegie 
Mellons design program, and currently reside in
jectively.
If you can manage the violence, the movie reveals 
itself as something filled with scene after scene of gutwrenching, touching cinematography: when Mary 
and Mary Magdalene mop up Jesus blood after the 
beating; when Simon carries the cross for Jesus; even 
when Jesus prays for his killers while hanging on the 
cross.
Say what you will about the light that the movie 
shines on the Jews, or what Gibsons motivation was. 
All external factors aside, this is a movie that everyone 
who sees it should judge for themselves. The film is 
still provoking enough that anybody who doesnt see it 
is missing what may become one of the most impor
tant movies of our day.

Nickel and Dimed
Drama continues series about money with hard-hitting expos on poverty
The arts have often been a venue to express socio
economic issues, bringing them to the attention of 
broader audiences. Such an artistic event occurred 
last Monday when the school of drama presented a 
staged reading of Nickel and Dimed by Joan Holden in 
the Chosky Theatre. Coming in a series of productions 
by the School of Drama that explore the role of money 
in our world and throughout history, the play is adapt
ed from Barbara Ehrenreichs 2002 book, Nickel and 
Dimed, Or (Not) Getting By In America.
Presented by the students and faculty of The 
Purnell Center for the Arts and directed by masters 
drama student Laura Gross, Nickel and Dimed details 
the true story of an investigative journalist, Barbara 
Ehrenreich, who went undercover into low-wage 
America to see whether or not she could keep herself 
clothed, housed, and fed on jobs such as waitressing, 
house-cleaning, and working in "Mal-Mart."
Barbaras character, performed by faculty member 
Claudia Benack, starts off thinking that with the right 
planning one can live off the wages one earns. 
Through experience, a gloomy picture develops of 
how entry-level work cannot adequately support even 
one person. Joining Benack on stage, playing the roles 
of co-workers and bosses, were drama majors junior 
Gaius Charles, senior Ian Christiansen, junior Aimee 
DeShayes, and junior Claudia Duran, and drama fac
ulty member Ingrid Sonnichsen.
Barb first job, as a waitress in Florida, earns her 
$2.15 an hour plus tip. (Barbara takes the nickname 
Barb while she decides to live in poverty) She quick
ly learns the hectic life of the American diner, and 
consequently of the low-wage American, as she is 
rushed by her boss, lives in a small trailer, and is 
forced to get an additional job cleaning motel rooms 
to make ends meet. The grim reality of low-wage life 
hits the theater patron with poignant force.
Overwhelmed by the experience of waitressing, Barb 
moves on.
Employed by a housecleaning team in Maine, Barb 
scrubs the homes of the rich. This job provides a peek 
into why poor Americans continue to stay poor. 
Uninformed about their rights, Barbs co-workers are 
essentially powerless to improve their lot. They are 
ignorant of workers compensation and fearful of los
ing their jobs if they press for their legal rights, such 
as maternity leave.
When Barbara calls the office posing as a customer 
to ask how much cleaners earn, the figure is more 
than twice the actual $6.65 an hour. Grateful for a 
job, workers make excuses for the difference. Despite 
her efforts, Barbara is unable to get her co-workers to 
stand up for their rights because of their fear of losing 
their jobs. Barbaras middle class instincts alienate her 
from her co-workers.
Moving to Milwaukee, Barb is employed by a large 
discount retailer, the thinly veiled Mal-Mart. After 
taking a urine test and a ridiculously indoctrinating 
test whose questions direct the worker toward an 
unquestioning allegience to the boss, she is not told 
her pay until after she starts working. Already facing 
long hours at $ 7/hour, Barb is ordered to clockout 
and return to work unpaid.
Finding a place to live proves impossible due to a 
tight housing market. This situation forces Barb to 
sleep at shelters and eat at pantries, while waiting for 
an apartment that never materializes. Barb quips at 
how Mal-Mart vests are hiding the always-present 
possibility of homelessness. With a sense of despera
tion Barbara finally uses her credit card and returns to 
her real life, an option low-wage Americans dont pos
sess.
Not wholly depressing, the play does have moments 
of warmness and laughter. Despite not having much, 
some of Barbs co-workers show surprising generosity, 
such as offering her a place to stay when she cannot 
find an apartment. Comic relief is perhaps the best 
asset. When considering the socioeconomic problems 
faced by Barb and her fellow co-workers  lack of 
health insurance, job insecurity, etc.  one can quick
ly become depressed with the conditions of how the 
other half lives. While scrubbing other peoples bath
rooms, Barb, in an aside, comments on three different 
types of fecal stains and of how America is losing 
pubic hair at an alarming rate. Additional wisecracks 
are peppered throughout the play both in terms of 
satire and character interactions. The depressing 
nature of the play becomes bearable in large part due 
to Barbaras wit.
A discussion led by Lowell J. Taylor, a Heinz School 
economist and former senior economist at the 
Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office 
of Bill Clinton, followed the play. Presenting poverty 
statistics, Taylor reiterated many of the points raised 
in the play, confirming Barbaras statement that 30% 
of Americans survive on less than $8 an hour jobs and 
that poverty is defined as the most basic food budget 
multiplied by three. The problem, according to Taylor, 
is that food in America is cheap. Taylor added that one 
in eight Americans is poor and one in six children lives 
in poverty.
More statistics referenced by Taylor can be found at

HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNiCK

Hypocrisy Now by Tim Kelly and Rashan Walker
Inevitable is such a heavy word by Chris and Ben
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Tomorrow, you will eat a real piece of whole fruit, not 
from a can.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Making your boyfriend stay up 
late so hell nearly fail all of his classes and graduate with the 
lowest passable GPA will not prove to be the best way to stop 
him from leaving you for graduate school, forcing you to other 
options, like talking.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): The way things are looking now, 
you may well grow up to have the huge, bulbous, bright yellow LEGO car 
(or as some people say, SUV) that you always dreamed about as a child, with room 
enough in the back for Barbie, Barbie's friends, her mansion, and her red convertible.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Thanks to your inherently late nature, losing your watch 
will have little impact on your day-to-day life. Losing your glasses, however, may result 
in some embarrassing close-talking scenes with your neighbors and nearly deaf, eld
erly philosophy professor.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): With warm weather coming, you can no longer use your 
calf-high winter boots to hide those funny holiday-patterned socks from your Mom that 
you wear to extend your laundry cycle. You will be forced to chose 
between the dreaded embracing of embroidered furry animals and 
the even more dreaded increased frequency of clothes washing.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Your lack of chop stick 
skills will become a blessing when you begin to use them reg
ularly at meals to slow down food consumption and improve 
digestion. Unfortunately, your abilities may improve with prac
tice.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): To seduce your crush, you will take a brief hike 
up Flagstaff Hill and lay out in the grass, pretending to enjoy nature and stifling your 
asthmatic wheezing just long enough to make your muddy butt worthwhile.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Cleaning your apartment would not normally 
double count as working out, but in rare disaster area cases such as yours, the heavy 
lifting and stair-stepping to and from the dumpster outside your building 17 times 
may just make quality.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Whatever your statistics professor tells 
you, the connection between the shoes you wear and daily precipitation levels is not 
an illusory correlation, but a causal relationship thanks to magical weather powers and 
their reckless sense of humor.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): You will find yourself insisting, in an argu
ment with a 4-year-old, that having two favorites of anything is impossible and there
fore not a valid reason for demanding two ice cream scoops. As word spreads, this 
unfortunate scene will quickly make you very unpopular among chil
dren 5 and under in the Pittsburgh region.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): While completing 
a fascinating 32-page midterm paper for class you will be 
able to enjoy this week's beautiful weather from the window 
of your dorm room, basking in the light reflected off of the 
brick wall your window faces.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): This week you will 
learn that the new dog you adopted from the pound is 
great at picking up girls, though actually in the being 
hurled into the air by the hulking mass of an excited 
beast without many marbles" way and "the dragged through 
Laura Semesky/Art staff the grass by the shirt collar way more than anything else.

duckbar r o
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond > *r*
Kent began his tale slowly and purposefully. About a hundred ^
and fifty years ago, our ancestors were fed up with how the pond was being gov
erned. One duck in particular especially hated the way things were being run. He 
tried to mind his own business, but the other ducks would disrupt his attempts 
at a peaceful life. Kents voice had an apocalyptic tone. Finally, this duck decid
ed to do something about the atrocities going on in the pond. He and some of his 
compatriots decided to form a secret society. They called themselves The 
Whales.  Kent whispered these last two words as if they were too sacred to even 
be uttered. An inopportune crack of thunder made them both jump. Kent looked 
around nervously and then continued. There was a reason they decided to name 
their group The Whales. Rupert nodded and leaned forward in his chair, eager 
to hear the rest of Kents story. Their leader had a very unique marking under his 
tailfeathers. And, if I am not mistaken, I saw the very same mark on your bottom 
when you leaned over to pick up some soap in the shower last week.

Comickaze:
To Whom It May Concern
Dear comic book publishers,
Comics feature not only super-powered beings, 
but also super-powered fiction. Issues are packed 
full of danger, intrigue, and triumph. Yet the great
ness of the comic book is no excuse for the short
comings of the medium. Just as congratulations are 
in order for great work, constructive criticism is 
imperative for improvement. The following letter is 
a list of grievances, with appropriate solutions 
attached.
1. Stop Killing Characters and Bringing Them 
Back
It seemed as though this unfortunate trend 
would end when Colossus took his own life recent
ly in the pages of UncannyX-Men. The beautiful and 
unexpected moment marked a turning point for 
comics, especially when Marvel declared his death 
permanent. The past is littered with great deaths of 
superheroes that have been scuttled away by their 
sensational return. The Dark Phoenix Saga was 
groundbreaking. But when Jean Grey returned 
from an ocean cabinet in a nearly unexplainable 
chain of events, the magic faded.
Similarly, the murder of Jason Todd (a.k.a. 
Robin) at the hands of the Joker was a defining 
moment. Yet when Jason Todds form was revived 
in order to batde Batman in the excessive parade of 
villains known as the Hush storyline, something 
just screamed gimmick. Months after the return 
of Jason Todd, Marvel sank the ship with Grant 
Morrisons not-so-shocking return of Magneto. 
Apparently the master of magnetism didnt die, 
although readers may have seen Wolverines three 
claws slicing right through Magnetos chest only 
two years before.
It becomes confusing as fans and creators 
attempt to remember when and how a hero may 
have died in the past. Truthfully, it doesnt matter 
all that much, considering the fact that these are 
fictional heroes unbound by any physical limits. 
But it becomes irritating to continually send heroes 
to the grave, only to resurrect them shortly there
after.
The solution: create new heroes for readers to 
bond with. Some classic characters have seen birth 
in the past couple of decades, such as Hellboy, 
Gambit, and Deadpool. But the current trend, 
marked by Jean Greys most recent martyrdom, 
points towards existing character death and 
rebirth. This is not to say that creating a great char
acter is an easy task. But this productive creativity 
is unquestionably superior to recycling a superhero 
from the grave.
2. No More Alternate Dimensions to Explain 
Away Confusing Continuity
It is only fair to condemn -a clich of storytelling 
when it begins to pervert the quality of the stories. 
This perversion is none other than the alternate 
dimension. Currently, the X-Men are embroiled in 
their own horrible alternate-dimension-style future 
known as Here Comes Tomorrow.
Strangely enough, the most relevant example of 
alternate dimensions is both the problem and solu
tion. DC Comics Crisis on Infinite Earths was an 
alternate reality crossover event which was used to 
par down the DC continuity to just one DC 
Universe. In theory, the idea sounds great  have 
the confusing continuity work for itself by being the 
reason for the elimination of all alternate dimen
sions. But the result was utterly more confusing 
than the concept.
The way to fix the problem of the alternate 
dimension comes in two parts. First, just pick one 
universe and stick with it. No more of Marvels 
Earth-616 being one of many. Rumors are circulat
ing that the new Superman stories are related to 
multiple dimensions manifesting different versions 
of the hero, causing these versions to crossover. 
Enter the second part of the solution: theres noth
ing wrong with different interpretations, just save 
it for a separate title. Marvels Ultimate Universe 
may be the best current example (along with DCs 
Elseworlds), in which heroes have the freedom to be 
unique from their original inceptions while being 
contained within their own realities.
These are only two prevalent clichs plaguing 
comic book storytelling today. By being critical, the 
intent is not to take for granted all the great tales of 
the past. Instead, the purpose is to build upon the 
strength of comic books and eliminate the bother
some weaknesses. Both the Back from the Dead 
and Alternate Dimension syndromes have had 
their place in comic book history. However, creat
ing new characters and building strong founda
tions within the boundaries of a comic titles reality 
have important and lasting benefits for fans and 
creators.
Sincerely,
Comickaze
