TECH WINS DUAL TRACK MEET 
WITH WESTINGHOUS.
Score 5234.
Last Saturday evening the uphold
ers of the plaid went out to Wilkinsburg and proceeded to get sweet re
venge for the defeat they suffered in
1912. The contest was for the Smith 
trophy.
This trophy is a beautiful silver lov
ing cup for which Tech and Westinghouse must battle, for three years. 
Last year Westinghouse won it by a 
score of 51 to 37. This year Coach 
Dull and his team decided they would 
win it by a better score. When the 
final count was taken it showed a 
score of 52 to 34.
Tech should have had five more 
added to her total, but on account 
of poor judgment, Kirk, who tied for 
first place in the 30-yard dash, did 
not even get a chance to run over. 
It was a very strange way to judge, 
all the spectators seemed to think. 
The fact that several of the judges 
sympathies were against Tech did not 
dampen the boys spirits as was shown 
by the vim with which they proceeded 
to break records.
The performance of Hazeltine, 
Techs distance man, was remarkable. 
In the two-mile race he lapped all his 
opponents and lowered the record to
10 33 1-5 min. That was exceptionally 
good for that track. He also came 
within five seconds of the one-mile 
after he had made such good time in 
the two-mile. There seems to be no 
limit to the endurance of that speedy 
man.
The treatment the Westinghouse 
Club accorded the Tech men was 
greatly appreciated. The dance was 
a fitting climax for the evening, and 
certainly showed the good will and 
friendly feeling which exists between 
Westinghouse and Tech.

TEMPORARY HYDRAULIC 
LABORATORY.
Will Be Fully Equipped.
TOSSING IN THE BLANKET
A picture combining a moral for the Plebes and a suggestion of the proper 
way to work up an appetite for lunch in the Beanery.
Foundations are now being laid at 
the west end of the Science Building 
for a temporary hydraulic laboratoryThe building will be of brick and tile, 
reinforced with steel beams, of one 
story in height, and will be 105 feet 
long by 45 feet wide. The floor will 
be of concrete.
At one end will be an open circular 
steel tank, 20 feet in diameter and 6 
feet in height. This will be used for 
storage purposes and will be con
nected to the suction end of the 
pumps. There will also be one wier 
tank, 10 by 4 b^ 3 feet deep, for 
experiments on different types of 
wiers.
The pumping equipment consists of 
the following machinery; one two 
stage centrifugal pump, capable of 
delivering 500 gallons per minute 
against a 200-foot head, and direct 
connected to a 50 H. P. variable speed
After warning students several 
times not to eat lunch in the halls 
or locker rooms, the upper class men 
finally carried out their threats by 
to.ssing the offenders in the blanket. 
In any group of humanity there are 
always a few who do not or will not 
pay heed to the warnings of those 
higher up, and the students at Tech 
seem to be no exception to the rule. 
Announcements were made at the gen
eral lectures that the locker rooms 
were not to be used as restaurants, 
but still the usual few scorned the 
rule laid down. A little surprise party 
was secretly planned for these per
sons and carried out much to their 
own dismay, but to the amusement of 
all others.
Two weeks ago yesterday, a num
ber of seniors and juniors raided the 
locker rooms and found several plebes
and a sophomore quietly partaking 
of their midday meal. This place was 
quickly disturbed and the scene of 
action was changed to the campus. A 
blanket was stretched, and one by 
one the trembling victims were tossed 
into the air. It was very evident that 
they were no gymnasts and their wild 
and weird gyrations furnished great 
sport for the spectators.
The precedent set is a good one. 
It should prove to the student body 
that the upper class men mean what 
they say when they threaten punish
ment for refusal to respect rules laid 
down by them. These rules are made 
in the interest of the schools, and 
should, therefore, be followed by every 
student. It is to be hoped that no 
further infringement of this or any 
other announcement will be attempt
ed. A hint to the wise should be 
sufficient.
motor; one double suction single stage 
centrifugal pump, delivering 750 gal
lons per minute against a 40-foot head, 
and direct connected to a 15 H. P. 
variable speed motor; and one small 
triplex pump, belt driven from the 
same motor. The laboratory will also 
be provided with a 12-inch double
impulse water wheel, a reaction 
turbine, and a Rife hydraulic ram.
A full equipment of miscellaneous 
machinery will be obtained. These 
will include measuring tanks, pitometers, venturi meters, and simple

THE BEANERYPAST, PRES
ENT AND FUTURE.
It certainly is unfortunate for some 
of us when The Tartan decides to get 
out a special on our dear old Beanery 
(from bean, meaning Boston, the 
brainy, and ry, from the Rushinandhelpyourself for feast). It means that 
to some one is given the joyful as
signment of writing an editorial on 
the past, present, and future of our 
one permanent, changeless, constant, 
immutable, invariable, steadfast, un
changeable, and unchanging institu
tion, The Beanery. With this rather 
nifty little introduction we will get 
down to the real task of giving to the 
long-afflicted student-body the true 
history of the Beanery and the out
line of the future of forementioned in
stitution.
One might be considered fairly 
clever and happy if one cared to make 
up a little creed for the Beanery, be
ginning, let us say, with,
I believe in Beans,
Pea soup, and 
Chronic indigestion, etc.
We refrain from that, however, out 
of consideration of the guy who de
signed the Senior (?)tables. WTe would 
not want to hurt his feelings. He did 
the best job around the place. Wre 
state the positive reason for our re
fraining, because we do not want to 
have anybody think that we even 
thought for a second that we could 
wound thus the feelings of any other 
part of the establishment. W'e could 
not. with stress on the not. You 
all know that nothing we could pos
sibly say in print would cause the 
food to feel any worse in your diges
tive apparatus. The only other part 
of the Beanery worth considering is
the cash register, not meaning to in
sult you by calling your digestive 
apparatus a part of the Beanery. Un
derstand? When this assignment was 
given to us, we at once started in 
to interview all the prominent per
sonages around, from the head to 
the boy who delivers the beans. We 
thought we could get some interesting 
and instructive views on the Beanery. 
We didbut we cant print them. If 
anybody would really like to hear 
them they can do so appearing on 
the top of Flagstaff Hill tomorrow 
night at midnight. If you come, be 
sure to hand the cop on the bridge 
fifty cents. Thats to be his rake-off 
for not breaking up the meating 
notice how the very thought of it af
fects our spelling. Youll be there? 
Thats good. You never dreamed 
there were such naughty words.
One time, long ago, the .Faculty 
thought that the students who were 
trying to take an engineering course 
in three years had not enough trouble 
and so they gave them the Beanery. 
That is how it happened. Per
sonally, we think the Faculty 
must have been over at the Oakland 
Beanery Lunch for a banquet the pre
vious evening, and that the food was 
a little richer than that to which 
they were used to carrying in their 
lunch boxes. Be that as it may, the 
Beanery happened thus and such is 
its past. Its present wre need not 
dwell upon. We all know it, particu
larly by smell. Its future is too sad 
to consider. If we tried to do jus
tice to the future of the Beanery, the 
four Deans would get together and 
sue us for causing the students to fail 
in their work, due to acute melan
cholia, superinduced by our treatment 
of the subject. The very nearest we 
dare to go is to say that the Beanerys 
past was intermittent dyspepsia; that 
the Beanerys present is chronic in
digestion; and that the Beanerys 
future is a slow and painful death for 
such as will feed there.
PRINCETON DINING HALLS.
Plans Under Way for General Re
organization of the System.
Princeton, X. J.Plans are under 
way in the dining halls of Princeton 
Lniversity for a general reorganiza
tion of the system which has been 
in vogue there for many years. These 
dining halls are the eating quarters 
of the two lower classes of Princeton 
L niversity and are directly under the 
management of a student committee 
including about twenty members. John 
M. Colt of Brooklyn has just been 
chosen Chairman of this committee 
for next year, and to him will fall 
the duty of directing the reorganiza
tion of the system.
The greatest innovation will be the 
introduction of student waiters, the 
newest way which will be provided 
for Princeton men who are in need 
of financial help. Heretofore a re
mission has been given needy students 
on their board bill, but the services 
which they have rendered have been 
merely nominal. Within the past year 
these students have complained to
the authorities on the plea that they 
are not earning their remission and 
have requested that work be pro
vided for them. The only work that 
would accommodate all the men who 
are in need of remissions is the serv
ing of the food, and it is expected 
that by next Fall Princeton will see 
this system thoroughly installed. In 
connection with this innovation the 
organization of a co-operative store 
is being considered which will pro
vide the upper-class clubs and the 
university dining halls with goods at 
wholesale prices.
CORRESPONDENCE.
[The Editors of The Tartan are 
pleased at all times to receive com
munications from any member of the 
Faculty or student-body upon sub
jects of timely interest. Such articles 
as are deemed of sufficient interest 
will be published at the first oppor

cannot be considered, but the names 
of correspondents will be withheld 
when so desired.]
PLANS FOR MASSACHUSETTS. 
TECH.
New Dormitories Are to Be Along 
Novel Lines.
Boston, Mass.The report of the 
special committee on dormitories for 
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology was presented this week to 
the council of the alumni. It was 
read by Charles W. Eaton of Haver
hill. The committee made an inspec
tion of all the newer college dormi
tories in the country, and those of 
the University of Pennsylvania come 
in for special consideration.
Mixing of the classes is advocated 
in the report by the technical com
mittee. Harvard at present is build
ing special dormitories for freshmen. 
The 'stairway system of housing, a 
small number of rooms on a floor clus
tered about the stairway for the house, 
is oarticularly favored.
There is an entire absence of 
lounges or dining rooms in the houses. 
The Walker Memorial Committee has 
a fund of $250,000 to provide a social 
buildmg for the students, and the 
plan is for a Commons for eating.
With reference to the Commons the
suggestions call for a building 100 
feet square which will have cooking 
and serving facilities for 1,000, with 
rooms great and small, and capable 
of various mergings of the smaller 
rooms by the removal of sliding par
titions.
One of the most striking features 
of the report was the evident desire 
to provide houses for the fraternities 
in units of the dormitories. The 
adaptations that are necessary may 
easily be made, and if necessary pub
lic rooms and dining halls may be 
provided. The fraternities will then 
be on the campus and they will be 
saved the expenditure of some hun
dreds of thousands of dollars that 
separate buildings would demand.
The plan contemplates three gen
eral types of apartments, single rooms, 
suites for one and suites for two. It 
is proposed to mix them up so that 
the student who finds a single room 
to be the limit of his purse will be 
in the house with more fortunate in
dividuals. It is proposed also to make 
all the sleeping rooms in the suites 
so nearly as may be fresh air rooms 
by windows running from ceiling to 
floor. The plan is to furnish the 
major articles of furniture.
Six hundred thousand dollars is the 
sum that will be necessary to expend 
on the dormitories in the beginning 
and eight acres of space are called 
for in the report.
Provision in this space is made for 
the growth of the institute, and the 
complement of dormitories will in 
the end cost fully $1,000,000. It is 
further stated that they should be 
ready in 1915, when the educational 
structures are finished. There will 
he a good deal of activity on the new 
site by the Charles when once the 
buildings are started, and the expen
ditures above the cost of the site will 
nearly touch $6,000,000.

THE TARTAN3
Whats What and How
That close corporation of unworld
liness known as the Faculty, fondly 
believes that it held the preliminary 
elimination trials for the Senior Mar
athon, prize,one cultured section of 
sheeps clothing, decorated with con
ventional designs,during <the first 
week of February. Natural but humil
iating error. The real trial, vulgarly 
known as the Junior Prom.; prize 
one share of stock (assessable for 
breach of promise) in the college 
widow, occurred more recently. How
ever, let us take a dispassionate glance 
at this matter of exams so recently 
epidemic in our midst.
It seems that at regular intervals, 
like the crises of a malarial fever, the 
Faculty falls victim to an exigent pas
sion for prodding around in the echo
ing intellectual caverns of the under
graduate system for dejected frag
ments of useful information, that it 
has made frantic, often despairing 
efiforts to insert despite the victims 
struggles and rather high state of con
stitutional resistance.
Finally, it resorts to hot applica
tions of mimeographed documents 
containing inquiries of an intrusive, 
often personal character relative to 
some incredible doings of supposed 
friends of the sufferer using the 
aliases of A, B & C. These hot ap
plications are designed to bring out 
to the surface the rash of formulae 
and fact that may or may not lurk 
in the gloomy and congested interior 
of the patient undergoing intellectual 
repairs.
This pedagogical third degree has 
the curious effect of developing a pas
sionate and previously unsuspected 
yearning for the activities of one of 
the other schools.
Especially the fellow who has sat 
gayly on the parlous edge of the edu
cational car, with his manicured feet 
hanging over the right of way, is 
sure to offer a transfer when the con
ductor comes along for his fare.
This Lenten season, knowm as ex
am week, is an era of ashes and sack
cloth for the membership of the 
Ancient Order of Knights of Rest, 
who have put their faith in the abil
ity of a wet rag and the rich essence 
of midnight oil to beget a lusty in
spiration just before the bell taps. 
The trouble is that the child is usu
ally born with infantile paralysis.
It is curious how prevalent is the 
undergraduate opinion that one can 
sneak up on wisdom from the rear 
and capture her with a species of 
bird lime known as a good bluff.
And then again it is sad but pain
fully true that even the faithful dis
ciple who has been industriously filing 
away fact and theory on his mental 
shelves all through the semester, too 
often finds (| when he confidently 
reaches for them in the throes of an 
exam that they have fused and run 
together into a mess that suggests 
a chapter from Mary Baker G. Eddys 
gospel of Christian Science.
Any way you look' at it an exam 
is a sporting proposition. --
There be those who have been ex
posed daily to the contagion of learn
ing and have not had even a mild at
tack of information, and who in a 
three-night Cooks tour of the pre
scribed courses have shown up at the 
end of the exams with all the symp
toms.
They have, so to speak, picked the 
winners miraculously out of a discouragingly large field. On the other hand 
consistent virtue too often sits down 
on the tack at the end, as the result 
of an unkind push from fickle fortune. 
In the last analysis the only safe bet 
is to take a stiff dose of nerve tonic 
and approach the exam like him who 
wraps the drapery of his couch about 
him, having first located the fire es
cape.

No, Clarence, that low, rakish build
ing with the 30-days-and-costs style 
of architecture is not the work-house, 
it is the School of Applied Indiges
tion, vulgarly known as the Bean
ery; and those grim-faced youths 
with the clamped teeth, and noble de
velopment of jaw muscles, are not 
criminals, they are heroes rushing 
forward to take another desperate 
chance on the mean-you.
Some of them will squander as 
much as ten or fifteen cents in a mad 
pursuit of gastronomic adventures, 
and they will get the worth of their 
money, in assorted lots, solid, liquid 
and gaseous.
And those others emerging with 
the rapt and introspective expression 
have just gotten theirs, and are ex
pecting a report from their depart
ment of the interior with mixed feel
ings of hope and apprehension.
It is a fascinating game as you see; 
let us go in and take a chance.
Now, Clarence, sit down in front 
of this bill of lading so beautifully 
engraved with chalk, and see if you 
can reach an agreement with yur 
stomach as to the form of dietetic 
rough house it would prefer to en
gage in. What is Irish stew? Come 
right in the waters fine; so much 
cannot be said, perhaps, of the other 
ingredients. It is born of poor and 
it is to be feared, dishonest parents, 
and came to the land of the free in 
the steerage. It doesnt understand 
our gastric language very well, ex
cept the cuss words. It formerly had 
a side partner known as Hungarian 
Shoelatch, but the latter was excluded 
by the immigration laws.
No, that is not a mob storming this 
shrine of hamburger steak (a dark 
and bloody mystery, by the way, with 
a recoil like an army musket), it is 
merely a stampede of Plebes, in fran
tic alarm lest before they can get an 
opportunity to whisper their hearts 
desires to the imposing corps of two 
pie-chaperones behind the breast
works, the upper classmen will have 
grabbed all the indestructible rolls 
(warranted for one year), and have 
retired ravening with them to their 
corners; or that the surviving baked 
beans will have been transferred to 
the Carnegie Museum as has-beans.

It is a notable scientific fact, Clar
ence, that these Plebes are evolving 
craws, due to the lamentable cir
cumstance, that after by prayer and 
fasting they finally succeed in aqcuiring the peculiar forms of consolation 
they seek, they have no time to mas
ticate within the time limit.
That gracefully drooping line they 
form, where those at the rear in their 
anxiety show tendency to fletcherize 
the necks of those in advance of them, 
has for its equation:
1 plate of beans plus 2 white-hope 
rolls, minus 10 cents, equals belly
ache.
That corner where the small tables 
form a meager fortification is the 
private ward for the Faculty, where 
they may practice their gastronomic 
vices in partial seclusion, and per
form the internal and external calis
thenics necessary to a temporary vic
tory over their food electives.
That group bent absorbedly over 
the rear table is engaged in a heated 
dispute as to whether the film on the 
butter plate is really an order of but
ter, or the cooks finger print. Those 
who so fatuously contend that there 
is no such concrete thing as a geo
metrical plane have never witnessed 
one of these buteric phenomena.
But you must not let this divert
ing vaudeville prevent you from se
lecting prizes from this charming in
ventory of more or less obsolete corpestibles. Now here is some pie a la 
morturi salutamus; be a sport and 
try a few rounds with it, Irish picnic 
rules, and no fouls called. If you 
last one round you get honorable 
mention; two rounds you get a hero 
medal and a student athletic ticket 
admitting you to all games except 
to those you most wrant to see.
You think it looks too much like 
suicide. All right, be a molly-coddle 
and dilute your manhood with toasted 
excelsior and vitalac. What! you 
think you will take an apple and a 
glass of water. Oh fie! fie, Clarence, 
youre a quitter.

MEMORIES.RESULTS OF VOTE IN APPLIED 
INDUSTRIES SENIOR CLASS
Did you ever take out a half hour 
and live in memories of past occur
rences? You probably have and if 
you will remember you thought then 
only of good times and pleasant 
things. Memories are wonderful 
friends to a fellow after he grows a 
little older. Even now you must get 
together with old Prep School chums 
once in a while and recount old times. 
It is surprising, isnt it, how the de
sire to purr comes over you at such 
times? If you have enjoyed yourself 
in this way, and we trust you have, 
you can certainly appreciate what a 
lot of those pleasant thoughts of old 
friends, good times and things will 
mean to you some time in the future 
when everything has a tendency to 
go wrong and when you are taking 
various kinds of indigestion tablets in 
hopes of relief from hotel or possibly 
your wifes bum cooking. If you dont 
have a number of agreeable things 
in common' with a lot of people you 
will find that you are proportionately 
shy of friends and old acquaintances 
will find you pretty dull and uninter
esting. You must, therefore, vibrate 
in synchronism with people or you 
will find no ties of friendship.
Seriously we hope you have thought 
of these things and that you have 
profited thereby. They are recalled 
to your memory because the purpose 
of this article is to have every fellow 
appreciate fully what social and other 
activities at Tech really mean to him. 
Every one of such student events 
should be supported by more men 
than usually attend, not only for the - 
friendships formed, the immediate 
good time and for himself generally, 
but also for his Alma Mater. We 
quote the mother of an engineering 
student in an eastern institution as 
saying that her son was instructed 
not to miss an event that did not 
seriously interfere with his work. That 
family is not overburdened with 
wealth but the father, a college man, 
knew what he was talking about when 
he instructed his son.
There are a number of things which 
you can do this year to show your 
spirit. Are you going to the Ten
nis Dance tomorrow night? Have 
you subscribed for your copy of The 
Thistle yet? There are a lot of home 
games scheduled for the baseball team 
which you should attend. The team 
is practising now and your presence 
and encouragement will be welcomed 
every afternoon you can arrange to 
be in the stand if only for a little 
while. If you will take the trouble 
to keep track of things you will find 
lots to do instead of going to the 
show, and if you will keep this in 
mind, and put it into practice things 
will become much more live and 
snappy around here than they are.

THE TARTAN5
MUSICAL CLUBS DELIGHT 
WEST VIRGINIANS
During the Easter vacation the 
Musical Clubs were taken on a threeday trip into West Virginia, giving 
concerts in Fairmont and Mannington. The following expurgated diary 
of the three days may give an idea 
of their achievements and joys.
Wednesday, the nineteenth, 8:00
a. m.
We are waiting for the train to start, 
but have 12 hours to get to Fairmont, 
so theres no hurry. Fellows are com
ing in like animals into the ark, in 
pairs of assorted sizes. Schuchman 
just discovered he forgot his break
fast and has gone out for some. . . . 
First cry of All aboard. Madison is 
just coming through the gate, and will 
probably hold us up until his digni
fied gait brings him aboard. He made 
it without running, and were off the 
same day. Must be a record for the
B. & O., judging from the attitude 
of the special agent. Now to catch 
up some sleep.
Same day, 9:05.
Just passed Washington with its 
usual delegation of students at the 
station. We have posters on all of 
the windows, but no streamers on our 
special car.
Also, 10:10.
Arrived in Wheeling only 15 min
utes late, but didnt stop over as in
tended.
Ten minutes later: Pulled into, or
beside, Benwood Jet. Have a 50-min
ute layover in a town of a station, a 
saloon and a grocery store.
B. J., 11:00 also morning.
Just leaving this burg. A couple 
of baseballs and a big flat below the 
railroad helped give the boys exercise 
and let them forget their troubles. 
Stewart couldnt find a barber shop 
and his face is in fnourning yet.
12 oclock, high noon.
Just got off to stretch a few legs. 
This town is called Cameron, and 
Jack must think he owns it. He point
ed out the Cameron Butcher Par
lor, the Cameron Dry Goods Em
porium and the Cameron Post Of
fice, and even spoke to a couple of 
Cameron Girls. Off again. No 
more poker for me, with Scalzo in 
the game.
2:00 P. M., Watson Hotel.
Arrived at Fairmont at last and 
fed the inner man. Head waitress 
warned us against loud conversation. 
As if we would make any noise. Stew
art found a barber shop.
5:00 P. M.
Mandolin quartet and Crawford and 
James gave a short concert at the 
Normal School and another at the 
High School, and Glee Club rehear
sal was held in the High School, where 
we appear tonight. We were divided 
mto pairs and escorted to homes of 
townspeople for dinner. Drew a place 
on the seventh hill from the Hall. No 
chickens in the family either. Must 
be unlucky. Crawford gave orders 
not to eat any dinner. . . .
2:00 A. M.
Concert went off fine before big 
crowd. Heard all sorts of compli
ments on the music and the render
ing. Mr. and Mrs. Chas E. Reed 
gave reception for the fellows and 
the High School seniors at the Reed 
home. Met all of the prettiest girls 
in Fairmont, and there was some 
crowd. . .
Thursday, 1:00 P. M.
Up at 8 and had breakfast with 
family. Swell boarding house. Did 
the town, ending up at the H. S., 
where friends of last night demon
strated Domestic Science.  Just fin
ished dinner at the Watson. Train 
leaves for Mannington at 1:25,, per
haps.
Thursday yet, 5:00 P. M.
Reached Mannington at 2:07. Took 
our car on to Wheeling, without us.
Glee Club rehearsed in School Hall, 
then we were taken to our homes 
for the night. Drew a nice quiet 
place, with two H. S. boys in family.
Saw an ox-team in the streets, which 
is typical of the town. A very pretty 
location.
Thursday, 11 P. M.
Concert went through as smoothly 
as possible. An immense crowd for 
the size of the town. Every ableminded inhabitant must have been 
there. Music was greatly appreciated.
This is the first affair of this class 
ever seen here, and we took them by 
storm. . . . Nothing but a drug
store here for amusement, and they 
wont sell cigarettes while the village 
police force is looking. As soon as 
he turns his back you ask for a sar
saparilla, and wink. Everyone is 
tired tonight, and there is no fun 
abroad.
Friday, 9 A. M.
This must be the country. Was 
called at 7 oclock, but the sun was 
up. Good breakfast. Have had fine 
weather so far, but it is starting to 
rain now. Train leaves at 10:12.
En Route, 11:30.
Made a mistake, forgetting we were 
to ride on the B. & O. The train 
did not leave at 10:12, being but an 
hour late. Some one discovered rasp
berry cider and almost missed the 
train. It is a dry beverage, so they 
say. Just lost Hamilton at Moundsvills.
Benwood Jet., 1:20.
Back again. Ten minutes stop for 
pictures and pie.
3:30 P. M.
Arrived in Wheeling 12:40, and 
waited while Hollister scrapped with 
Station Master about our special car.
Peace declared, we hiked for the McLure Hotel, where we had some meal.
Had the Grill Room all to ourselves.
Had one hour to visit in Wheeling, 
then train left at 3:20. Postcards, 8 
for a nickel.
B. & O. R. R., nr. Pgh., 5:30.
Just lost eight straight games of 
500 with different partners. We have 
passed the last tunnel and are almost 
home. Am certainly glad we took 
the trip, and "the natives must be, 
too, if one should believe the local 
papers of the two towns. Hollister 
and Crawford bought out one whole 
issue. The editor may now buy a 
hair cut. Back in Smoketown again, 
almost on time, and its' all over.
