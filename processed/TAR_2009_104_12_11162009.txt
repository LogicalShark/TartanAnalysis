City proposes fair 
share tax on tuitions
House passes 
healthcare bill
SABRINA PORTER
Personnel Manager
Last Monday, Pittsburgh 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl pro
posed a 1 percent fair share 
tax that would add about 
$400 to Carnegie Mellons 
annual tuition. The mayor 
proposed the tax in order to 
fill a $15 million void in the 
city budget for pensions and 
the Carnegie Library of Pitts
burgh system. If enacted, the 
tax would be the first to tax 
college tuition in any city in 
the nation.
Carnegie Mellons official 
position is with the Pittsburgh 
Council on Higher Educa
tion (PCHE), a coalition of all
Pittsburgh colleges and uni
versities, which opposed the 
tax at a press conference last 
Tuesday.
Mayor Ravenstahl wants 
to solve his budget problems 
by taxing this financially 
stressed group of students. I 
cant find fairness in this pro
posal, said the president of 
the Association of Indepen
dent Colleges and Universities 
of Pennsylvania (AICUP), Don 
Francis, in a press release.
Student Body President 
Rotimi Abimbola, a senior 
double major in political sci
ence and international rela
tions, voiced her opinions,
. much in line with the AICUP.
To be honest, [my initial
reaction was] that it was ab
solutely preposterous. I am 
shocked that the mayor thinks 
that $400 is just spare change 
to us, Abimbola said.
Abimbola also brought the 
issue back to a lack of mayoral 
involvement with students.
It felt like another low 
blow after he had failed to 
show up at the Mayoral Fo
rum that Student Government 
[at Carnegie Mellon] hosted a 
week before the election, she 
said.
Teresa Thomas, assistant 
vice president for media re
lations at Carnegie Mellon,

Recent graduates will feel the effects of the new healthcare bill.
In a unanimous vote taken Thursday, Student Senate passed a preliminary resolution against the fair share 
tax." The Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education also chose to oppose the tax last Thursday.

On Saturday, Nov. 7, the 
U.S. House of Representa
tives passed the Health Care 
Reform Bill, H.R. 3932, in 
the late hours of the night 
under the full name Afford
able Health Care for America 
Act. The margin was quite 
narrow, with the votes 220 
to 215. Specifically, only one 
Republican voted for the bill, 
Joseph Cao of Louisiana, and 
39 Democrats voted against 
it. The purpose of the reform 
is to attempt to provide cov
erage for the more than 45
million Americans without 
health insurance.
Though the reform bill 
has passed the House, the 
Senate must now vote on 
its own reform bill, as both 
houses of Congress must ap
prove their own bills before 
a single bill from both hous
es can be presented to the 
President. The process can be 
complicated  each bill must 
travel through committees in 
the houses before the actual 
vote, similar to the one on the 
night of Nov. 7 in he House 
of Representatives.

Bookless libraries increase accessibilityCarson Loop Bus may draw additional fees
Michelle Liu/Photo Staff
Many libraries are moving toward bookless collections where publica
tions would be made available online in an electronic format. Elec
tronic books increase longevity and accessibility of publications.
COURTNEY WinEKIND
Assistant News Editor
The Carson Loop Bus is 
one of Carnegie Mellons new
est services. It was initiated by 
former student body president 
and vice president Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole and 
began running as a trial service 
during the spring semester of 
last year. According to the Stu
dent Government website, the 
bus is a weekend, nighttime 
loop bus for undergraduate 
and graduate students that 
encourages students to ex
plore other Pittsburgh neigh
borhoods. Stopping at 11 
locations, the Loop Bus pro
vides opportunities to travel 
to a variety of neighborhoods 
that offer bars, shopping, and 
entertainment throughout 
Pittsburgh.
The Loop Bus operates 
Fridayand Saturday nights, 
from 7 p.m. -to 2 a.m., run
ning between the University 
Center turnaround and a va
riety of local Pittsburgh loca
tions along Forbes and Fifth 
Avenues and into the South 
Side. It runs hourly from 7 
p.m. to 9 p.m. and half-hourly 
from 10:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., 
leaving from the University 
Center.
Currently, the Loop Bus is 
free for all students with an 
ID and even allows students 
to bring a non-student guest 
along. However, the adminis
tration is considering charging 
students an extra fee for ac
cess to the bus. The fee will be 
discussed at the next Student 
Senate meeting on Thursday
at 5 p.m. in Breed Hall, Mar
garet Morrison Carnegie Hall 
103.
The bus was originally 
modeled off Duquesne Uni
versitys SGA Loop and Port 
Authoritys former UV Loop.
Duquesne Universitys 
Loop bus is free of charge. Ac
cording to Duquesnes student 
government website, Fr. Ho
gan, the Executive Vice Presi
dent for Student Life and Stu
dent Government jointly fund 
the loop bus as a service for 
students. This joint effort is 
so students can go and come 
back from different city loca
tions safely.
The Port Authoritys UV 
Loop was to be a hip new 
urban bus loop that will link 
many of Pittsburghs diverse 
neighborhoods on - Friday 
and Saturday nights. 
Starting in
2002, the bus traveled every 
weekend from Downtown to 
the South Side, through Oak
land and the East End, then 
back through Lawrenceville 
and the Strip District until re
turning downtown. The route 
was chosen, the Port Author
ity explained, to join many 
of Pittsburghs great neigh
borhoods and entertainment 
highlights including theatres, 
restaurants, and other perfor
mance and cultural destina
tions. The bus ceased opera
tion soon after it began based 
on low ridership and broader 
financial issues.
I would be abnormally 
astounded if there would be 
a charge for the Loop Bus. It 
is a breach of my trust in the 
institution. This is an exercise 
in exhortation and the fee is 
ridiculous, said Harrison Ap
ple, a first-year art student.
Student Government plans 
to have a final decision about 
the fees in the coming 
weeks.

Cushing Academy in Mas
sachusetts gained national 
attention in September when 
it announced plans to replace 
its collection of more than 
20,000 books with a massive 
electronic database.
Carnegie Mellon has for 
years already been building 
its own bookless library: 
For the nearly 15 years Ive 
been in the Carnegie Mellon 
Libraries, weve been work
ing hard to provide the cam
pus with what I think is a very 
realistic view of the library of 
the future. We are working 
towards a hybrid of an on
line and paper-based library, 
computer science librarian 
Missy Harvey explained.
We have become a leader 
in the field of digitizing im
portant materials to make 
them available online. Car
negie Mellons libraries are 
currently working on a num
ber of [digitization] projects 
to expand its inventory of 
online books and resources, 
Harvey said.
The rarity of many works 
in the Posner Memorial Col
lection highlights the ad
vantages of the increased 
accessibility and longev
ity of electronic republish
ing. Rare books [can be] 
scanned and delivered via the 
World Wide Web to scholars 
in places such as Argentina 
and Germany who could not 
visit the books, Mary Catha
rine Johnsen, the special 
collections and design librar
ian, said. Electronic versions 
save wear and tear on using 
the physical book, which is 
important if you are a book 
from 1755 and your leather 
spine is dry and cracking.

Student Senate votes to oppose fair share tax on college tuition
TAXES, from A1
contributions that Carnegie 
Mellon students already make 
to the city.
Last year, students, fac
ulty and staff logged more 
than 117,000 hours of com
munity service to the regions 
schools and cultural institu
tions, Thomas said. Many 
students work in Pittsburgh, 
some holding down multiple 
jobs. We support the use of 
mass transit and the citys mu
seums. Working students pay
the city a range of taxes from 
wage to real estate and fees.
Ou Thursday, Student Sen
ate Chair Aaron Gross, a junior 
social and decision sciences 
major, identified such benefits 
as the reason behind Carnegie 
Mellons and Pittsburgh col
leges roles as an economic 
engine for the city.
Abimbola echoed both 
Gross and Thomas when she 
said, The state of the citys 
finances is not our fault. We 
are the life of the city. We will 
continue to make great contri
butions to the city, but I dont 
think we are giving less than 
we should be.
The official position of 
Student Senate is against the 
tax. In a unanimous vote, Sen
ate agreed Thursday to pass a 
preliminary resolution against 
the fair share tax.
Students mentioned ideas 
such as a night of all Pitts
burgh college students boy
cotting Oakland and Southside to show the city just how 
much they contribute to local 
businesses. Senate has formed
Pittsburghs Mayor Luke Ravenstahl proposed a 1 percent fair share tax" on student tution. The tax would 
add around $400 to Carnegie Mellons annual tuition. On Thursday, Carnegie Mellons Student Senate passed 
a preliminary resolution against the tax.
a special committee for this is
sue. They met for the first time 
this past Saturday and will be 
planning how to work within 
Carnegie Mellon, with other 
Pittsburgh schools, and with 
the city to fight the proposed 
tax.
Students at the Senate 
meeting mentioned a long 
list of problems, including 
double taxing if a students 
family lives in Pittsburgh and 
the added burden placed on 
the institutions to cover these 
fees as part of the cost of at
tendance.
The students eligibility 
for aid would be based upon 
the inclusion of this fee in his 
overall educational expenses, 
said Linda Anderson, director 
of student financial aid at Car
negie Mellon.
Anderson, Thomas, and 
the press release from AICUP 
all indicated they did not ex
pect that this bill would pass. 
The AICUP added in their 
press release that if it were to 
pass, they would be prepared 
to take the city to court for the 
legality of such a tax.
The vote is expected by the 
end of this year. With weeks 
left in the semester, there is 
little time left to fight the tax, 
according to Gross.
I was a part of the Stu
dents for Obama group that 
did a lot of work on campus 
last spring. In that time, I saw 
students at Carnegie prove 
that we are not apathetic. I 
think that the mayors office 
and some city council mem
bers are under the impression 
that college students will not 
organize themselves to fight 
against [this]. We will, and 
when we do, we will shake up 
the city, Abimbola said.

Senate prepares to 
vote on healthcare
HEALTHCARE, from A1
The bill has inspired con
troversy throughout" the
country, especially along 
party lines. There are sev
eral key features of the bill 
that can be found within the 
approximately 2000-page 
text. If enacted in its current 
state, it would create the 
Health Choices Administra
tion, an independent agency 
with a Health Choices Com
missioner as leader. An ad
ditional Health Insurance 
Exchange program through 
the Health Choices Adminis
tration would provide health 
care coverage to Americans, 
including a public option pro
vided through the govern
ment.
The public option is a 
proposed government health 
care plan that would be de
signed to compete with regu
lar insurance companies, 
said Aaron Marks, a senior 
business administration ma
jor, who noted a possible flaw 
in that the government does 
not have [to] turn a profit to 
stay in business, while insur
ance companies do.
The bill includes a pro
hibition against insurance 
companies denying cover
age to those with preexist
ing conditions and forbids an 
essential benefits package 
from implementing annual or 
lifetime coverage limits. A 5.4 
percent tax would be applied 
to single individuals earning 
over $500,000 a year and to 
couples earning over $1 mil
lion a year, while another tax 
could affect those without 
any coverage and employers 
who fail to cover their em
ployees. The plan itself could 
reportedly cost over one tril
lion dollars, adding to the 
United States debt.
As the Senate prepares to
vote on its own health care 
reform bill, there are several 
obstacles in its way, mainly 
differences between the 
two houses and filibuster at
tempts. The senior director of 
health care services and ini
tiatives in the Heinz College, 
David Dausey, explained that 
the largest challenge facing 
the passing of any legislation 
will happen in the HouseSenate Conference Commit
tee, where leaders from the 
House and the Senate will 
have to iron out the differ
ences between the bill that 
was just passed in the House 
and whatever bill gets passed 
in the Senate.
If the bill is passed within 
the next year, it would not 
take full effect until 2013, the 
year in which most first-years 
will graduate. Thus, the ef
fects of the bill will mostly be 
felt by those who have recent
ly graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon and are entering the 
job market. Primarily, stu
dents would be able to expect 
medical coverage with their 
first jobs, which is not neces
sarily true today. The maxi
mum age for dependents to 
remain on their parents in
surance plan is usually 25 or 
2,6.
Martin Gaynor, an eco
nomics professor in the Hei
nz College, said, One group 
it very likely would affect is 
recent college graduates.... It 
is a very common situation to 
graduate from CMU and ei
ther not have a job right away 
or not have a job that has 
benefits. Most of these people 
would find... that they would 
be much more likely to have 
insurance after graduating 
college.
In the coming weeks, the 
country must await the deci
sion of the Senate in regard to 
its health care reform bill.

eJournals  for many years. 
We are purchasing eBook 
versions of reference books 
because they lend themselves 
to being used primarily on
line, Harvey explained.
There are many who have 
concerns about transition
ing to an electronic medium. 
Johnsen points out that the 
idea of a bookless library is 
still very new and its execu
tion has not yet been perfect
ed. I know of a project where 
many books were sent from 
the United States to foreign 
countries for cheap scanning. 
The books returned disbound 
and tied in bundles and un
usable as books, recounted 
Johnsen. The pixels were 
not sent back to the United 
States in an accessible form. 
Therefore, until the pixels 
are accounted for, the books 
have died.
Johnsen also said that even 
in successful scans of books to 
electronic formats, the many 
subtleties in a books presen
tation and metadata may be 
lost in an online medium. 
For literature students, you 
really want to see the origi
nal format of the work as re
ceived by its first public. Was 
it a fancy coffee-table book? 
Was it a cheap paperback or 
flimsy pamphlet? Was it a col
orful book to tempt you in a 
Victorian train station or an 
airport bookstall?
Even in more quantitative 
and technical subjects where 
aesthetic presentation is of
ten not as important as actual 
content and data, many still 
seem to prefer books to elec
tronic documents. ,
When learning about 
quantum mechanics, mathe
matical logic, polymer chem
istry, and numerous other 
complex fields, I continue to 
observe users preferring to 
touch pencil to paper  to 
engage the physical book  
rather than read the dense 
content solely online, Har
vey said. Some think that 
the sciences, in particular, 
lend themselves to shifting 
towards accessing every
thing online. Yet so far, the 
evidence doesnt support the 
hypothesis.
In fact, according to Har
vey, the most popular library 
books at Carnegie Mellon are 
in computer science.
Regardless of whether 
they have books or not, both 
Harvey and Johnsen pre
dict that libraries will keep 
their roles as areas of study, 
research, and learning. A li
brary is still a place to come 
to think, ponder, read, study 
with others, and other ac
tivities of learning, Johnsen 
said. One of our main mis
sions is to help students and 
faculty learn how to use dif
ferent types of information 
and to access them and to use 
them efficiently. This is now 
more important than ever. 
Harvey also said, Our ed
ucational community looks to 
librarians to help them learn 
how to navigate the complex 
information landscape. 
However, James Tiacy, the 
headmaster of Cushing Acad
emy, explained his decision 
to replace his schools books: 
When I look at books, I see 
an outdated technology, like 
scrolls before books.

Qatar first-years spend the weekend after midterms in Muscat, Oman. Students played games and went rock climbing and mountain biking, admir
ing the scenery of Oman while also learning about the lifestyle and culture of the Omanese people.
Qatar students engage new culture in Oman
Safety was of prime impor
tance and the safety mea
sures taken were impressive; 
many students overcame their 
fear of heights after the rockclimbing activity. Mountain 
biking was yet another activ
ity by which the bikers were 
rewarded with a closer view 
of Omans natural beauty and 
village lifestyle, something 
that is rare in this part of the 
world. Most students complet
ed two activities and by the 
time we reached the resort, it 
was time to pack up.
This trip was truly a memo
rable one; it was the greatest 
opportunity for each indi
vidual to interact with other 
students, faculty and staff. 
The trip was thoroughly re
freshing, especially after the 
stressful midterm week. Such 
trips, along with enriching 
our cultural knowledge, also 
increase our understanding of 
the lifestyle of people in dif
ferent nations.
I am completely sure all 
who went on the trip share the 
same view and also hope to be 
able to undertake such trips in 
future.

Special to the Tartan
After a series of never end
ing midterms, eighty fresh
men, accompanied by about 
fifteen faculty and staff, gath
ered at the Doha International 
Airport for what would soon 
be their best weekend ever. 
Each student present, even 
though a little weary after the 
Java midterm, gleamed with 
excitement.
It was amazing to see about 
a hundred of us move in a line 
towards a separate counter 
arranged just for Carnegie 
Mellon University Qatar. We 
finally boarded the flight to 
Muscat, landing at the Seeb 
International Airport later in 
the evening. Then onwards 
we traveled 40 kilometers by 
bus to the Al-Nahda Resort 
and Spa, Barka.
At the resort, we were as
signed our villas in which 
we were to stay for the next 
two days. The villas housed 
3-5 persons each and the 
roommates were grouped 
randomly in order to encour
age interaction between every
student. The resort was colos
sal  we used bicycles to get 
from one place to another. 
This was the best part: about 
fifty of us, cycling around the 
resort at 3 a.m. Nobody was 
ever in the mood to sleep, thus 
there were gangs of bikers all 
around the place.
The following morning, 
breakfast was arranged at the 
restaurant; everybody was 
fresh and excited about the 
days activities, despite last 
nights sleeplessness. After 
breakfast, all of us gathered at 
the football field for a briefing 
after which we were divided 
into groups randomly to par
take in various games. There 
was a math puzzle, a canalbuilding game and several 
other team-building activities. 
It was interesting to see how 
people, who barely knew each 
other, cooperated and pro
gressed as a team. The days 
fun concluded with a lavish 
lunch at the restaurant with 
various kinds of meals, salads 
and of course, dessert!
Next, we assembled at the 
field again. We were divided 
into groups for archery and
the crate building game. 
This game was peculiarly in
teresting, as we had to stand 
on a crate, maintaining our 
position and balance while 
adding more crates to the 
crate tower. Some students 
actually reached the maxi
mum of nine crates, which 
was admittedly a very hard 
goal. Archery was another 
interesting activity, since the 
majority of students were 
trying it for the first time. Al
though very few hit the target, 
it was unanimously enjoyed. 
Then, for the following three 
hours, there was the ultimate 
Frisbee; a game I thought was 
pretty dumb before the Oman 
trip. My opinion soon changed 
though; it is an excellent game 
and requires good reflexes and 
Frisbee estimation skills.
The next day was a big one, 
with all sorts of activities that 
most of us were attempting for 
the first time  rock climbing, 
mountain biking, Via-ferratta, 
village walk and even yoga for 
the ladies. Rock climbing and 
Via-ferratta were unquestion
ably some of the more physi
cally challenging activities.

Future contacts include head-up display
Researchers at the University of Washington led by Babak 
Parviz are developing contact lenses that include the necessary 
components to produce virtual images in users eyes. The circuit
ry included in the lens projects an image directly into the eye, 
without blocking the field of vision. The devices can be powered 
by nearby radio sources. Eventually, the research team hopes 
that cell phones will be able to power the lenses at the same time 
they send content.
Current implementations of head-up displays often have a re
stricted area, but the technology under development by Parviz 
should be able to project images across the entire field of view. 
The applications range from recreational use an4 gaming to mili
tary information systems. While this technology is still only in 
the prototype stage, the team will be presenting their findings at 
the Biomedical Circuits and Systems conference this month.
Scientists find new dinosaur species
A team led by Adam Yates of Johannesburgs University of the 
Witwatersrand has uncovered the bones of up to four new dino
saur species. The fossils were found in Spion Kop in the South 
African province of Free State, a location of many paleontologi
cal sites. While the team expected to find fossils from massospondylus, a common dinosaur of the area, they actually found bones 
from the species now named Aardonyx celestae.
The significance of the Aardonyx find is that it fills a gap in 
the evolutionary history of dinosaurs. At one stage in their evo
lution, huge sauropods such as brontosaurus began to separate 
from the earlier bipedal dinosaurs.
The Aardonyx specimens found were young, but Yates claims 
that an adult might have grown to 50 feet and weighed half a 
ton. Yates hopes that continued excavation at the site will reveal 
more about the other new species found.
NASA finds water on the moon
Scientists studying data returned by an October lunar mission 
announced Friday that they had definitive evidence of water near 
the lunar surface. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing 
Satellite (LCROSS) was a NASA mission that on Oct. 9 crashed 
a spacecraft into a crater near the moons south pole. Scientists 
projected that the impact would send a plume of debris several 
miles high. Since that time, the team has been working to ana
lyze the data picked up by spectrometers, which can analyze the 
components of the plume.
After a month of work, Anthony Colaprete, the projects lead 
scientist, announced that they had found over 25 gallons of wa
ter. This confirmed the long-held belief that water did exist on 
the lunar surface, and it encourages proponents of lunar colo
nies. Astronauts would be able to use existing resources insteadof bringing everything they needed from Earth.
Science & Technology
Seminar teaches strategies to expose liars f,LmjaLK '---------rHearing loud sounds
from inside the head
BRIAN LEE
Assistant SciTech Editor
Try and imagine this pe
culiar scenario  you are 
laying in your bed, about to 
fall asleep after a long day, 
when suddenly you are jolted 
awake by a bright flash of 
light and the intense sound 
of a cannon shooting right in 
your own room. Puzzled and 
shocked, with your heart rac
ing, you look around anxious
ly for the source of the noise 
only to realize that there was 
no cannon, and that it had 
originated from within your 
own head.
This is typical of the 
strange disorder known as 
exploding head syndrome, 
a condition that causes a 
person to hear an incompre
hensibly loud noise that is 
merely a vivid auditory hal
lucination.
However, unlike the name 
suggests, heads do not actu
ally explode, and it does not 
usually cause the sufferer any 
physical harm.
In some cases, however, 
a sharp stabbing pain can 
accompany the sound. The 
sound varies between people 
with this condition, hav
ing been described as a loud 
explosion, waves crashing, 
people screaming, or a loud 
ringing, among others.
People with exploding 
head syndrome usually report 
hearing the noises one or two 
hours after going to sleep.
However, these sounds 
can also happen when wak
ing up from a deep sleep, and 
during the day when the suf
ferer is wide awake.
This shows that exploding 
head syndrome is not a sleep 
disorder.
Many people who hear 
the noises have associated 
them with certain scenarios, 
as these hallucinations sound 
so real: The noises sound like 
a train is going through the 
room, a car is crashing out
side, or someone is firing a 
gun next to their head.
Although these halluci
nations are thought to be 
harmless, a person who has 
heard the noise will develop 
anxiety and an accelerated 
heartbeat.
Sudden, unexplained, and 
extremely loud noises would 
cause any person to be shak
en; however, personal ac
counts reveal that sometimes 
the related anxiety is not due 
to the sound itself, but rather 
is a physical reaction that' 
may happen some time after 
the noise. Hearing the sound 
may actually feel as if a pres
sure were being relieved from 
inside the head.
Along with the bright flash 
of light that is known to ac
company the noises, muscle 
twitches and breathing diffi
culty are also associated with 
the noise.
Although exploding head 
syndrome may not cause ad
verse physical effects, it may 
lead to the sufferer being un
able to sleep due to a fear of 
hearing the noise or experi
encing the other symptoms. 
This may lead to other sleep 
disorders, such as insomnia.
On the other hand, in 
some cases, the sufferer may 
actually become accustomed 
to the noise, and will no lon
ger experience the anxiety 
and fear that usually devel
ops after hearing the loud 
noises.
Currently, there is no 
known reason for the causes 
of these sounds. Some re
searchers have linked the 
syndrome to stress and sleep 
deprivation, as these are 
common among sufferers.
Another explanation is a 
small seizure in the temporal 
lobe, which is a part of the 
brain that contains the cells 
responsible for hearing.
A physical reason has also 
been proposed, explaining 
that a component of the mid
dle ear or of the Eustachian 
tube may suddenly move.
The Eustachian tube is re
sponsible for the popping 
in the ear during pressure 
changes, like when one swal
lows during the descent of an 
airplane.
Currently, tests are being 
done on people who suffer 
from exploding head syn
drome. These may lead to 
insights on the phenomenon, 
as well as how the brain inter
prets noises.
No pattern of occurrence 
can be discerned for explod
ing head syndrome, as its 
frequency may decrease or 
increase over time. Some re
port hearing a series of noises 
over the course of a few days 
before stopping completely, 
but then the noises will re
turn a few months later.
Some people experience 
exploding head syndrome 
only once in1 their lifetimes; 
for others, it is a recurring 
event that they gradually 
learn to control.
However, a few general 
trends have been observed; 
for example, women expe
rience exploding head syn
drome more than men, and 
people over the age of 50 are 
more likely to have exploding 
head syndrome, although it 
has been reported in patients 
as young as 10.
Reducing the frequency 
of exploding head syndrome 
symptoms can be done indi
rectly, through stress man
agement.
In addition, time manage
ment has been shown to help, 
as it enables sufferers to sleep 
more, lessening their sleep 
deprivation.
It has been reported that 
doing stress-relieving activi
ties before sleeping can re
duce the occurrence of hear
ing noises. These include 
yoga, meditation, hot baths, 
and walking.
In some cases, clomip
ramine, a drug clinically 
shown to treat depression, 
has been shown to help the 
patients.
Frank Marsh, a former Marine Corps intelligence officer, gave a lecture on lie detection last Thursday. Marsh discussed topics such as handwriting 
analysis and cues given by people when they lie.
ABHAY BUCH
Junior Staffwriter
You do not lie to Frank 
Marsh. There is no point, 
because he will know when 
youre lying. It is his job to 
know. A former Marine Corps 
intelligence officer, Marsh 
now studies the ways in which 
people deceive others and 
themselves. Last Thursday, 
Marsh gave a lecture about 
how to detect lies and the 
ways in which people dem
onstrate their true intentions 
with every word and deed.
As one would expect from 
an expert in understanding 
people, Marsh knew how to 
play the crowd. Skilled in the 
art of deadpan, he had people 
rolling in the aisles without 
ever actually seeming any
thing less than serious.
His vivid, sometimes dis
turbing descriptions certainly 
brought out his guiding prin
ciple: What you say tells me 
what you see; what you see 
tells me what you think; what 
you think tells me who you 
are. Marsh spent much of his 
lecture discussing the impor
tance of words, saying, By 
your words youll be justified; 
by your words youll be con
demned. He noted that word 
choice subconsciously conveys 
intent, pointing out that when 
one takes the elevator to the 
top floor of a 50-story build
ing, the verb used is that one 
went to the top floor, but 
after climbing the stairs to the 
top of the same building, the 
verb is that one got to the 
top floor.
Marsh demonstrated the 
fact that people use incorrect 
grammar to subconsciously 
mark something as bad and 
to distance themselves from 
it. Also, he showed how ly
ing, obfuscating, and conceal
ing things requires a form of 
verbal surgery where the 
omissions and deceptions can 
be seen, just like the scars of 
a physical surgery. But omis
sions are not the only ways 
that people give themselves 
away: Liars will also include 
excessive detail in their de
scriptions in an effort to con
vince the listener. When he 
talked about detecting lies, 
Marsh said that everybody 
must follow Millers Law, 
which states: If you want to 
tell if someone is telling the 
truth, you must believe that 
what they are saying is, in fact, 
true. Marsh said that studies
have shown that police offi
cers and other people who are 
suspicious by nature or train
ing are actually much worse at 
spotting lies accurately. This 
is because even liars tell the 
truth more than 90 percent of 
the time. Indeed, most people 
lie by omission rather than by 
commission, in that they leave 
truths out more often than 
they add lies in. Marsh said 
that people must start with a 
mindset along the lines of I 
know what you are telling me 
is the truth, but what is true of 
it?
Marsh then moved on to 
non-verbal clues that indicate 
deception. His strategy is to 
look for abnormal behavior 
as an indicator of deception. 
However, he stressed that the 
search for abnormal behavior 
is futile unless one knows what 
is normal and what is not for a 
particular person. That is to 
say that it is necessary to estab
lish a baseline before actually 
saying anything about a per
sons behavior. His approach 
to questioning involves asking 
a number of innocuous ques
tions before moving on to the 
real, pressing ones. Marshs 
last point about behavior as 
an indicator echoes a funda
mental principle of body lan
guage: that gestures must be 
studied in clusters and in con
text. Isolated gestures have 
no meaning. A single motion 
can mean many things. Thus, 
gestures must be grouped 
into related clusters and then 
analyzed. The same set of ges
tures performed by a man and 
a woman may mean different 
things. Likewise, the same 
set of gestures performed by 
people from different cultures 
may mean different things. 
Thus, context is also essential 
in looking at gestures.
Marsh is also a qualified 
handwriting analyst, and he 
walked the audience through 
the various techniques which 
he uses to analyze texts 
and their authors. He said, 
A change in spacing and a 
change in slant are the two 
biggest indicators of decep
tion in handwriting. He also 
highlighted changes in sizing, 
tone, darkening, and pres
sure as ways to determine the 
mood and intent of a writer. 
Darkening and underlining 
can also be seen as a form of 
overcompensation, where au
thors attempt to direct atten
tion away from the area they 
think is suspicious.

Plextronics improves 
LEDs and solar cells
mimGSWQRK
Pandora: Internet radio with personalized music
DYLAN MORI
Junior Staffwriter
If youre familiar with 
Sony technology, particularly 
the 2007 OLED digital TV, 
youve witnessed technology 
currently being refined by a 
team led by Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys vice president 
for research, Richard Mc
Cullough.
In addition to his duties as 
vice president for research  
which include managing cor
porate research and campuswide projects and overseeing 
student-inclusive research 
projects  McCullough man
ages his own spin-off compa
ny, Plextronics.
Launched in 2002 by Mc
Cullough and its current 
CEO, Andy Hannah, Plex
tronics is based in Harmorville in the University of Pitts
burgh Applied Research Park 
with a current staff of about 
70 people.
The mission of the com
pany  Light. Power. Cir
cuitry  describes one of 
the companys projects: the 
development of printable so
lar cells made completely out 
of plastic.
McCullough points out 
the scope of this project: 
Imagine plastic that can be 
coated on any surface that 
could be harnessing power 
outside and even in low-light 
conditions.
The other area of focus for 
Plextronics is display tech
nology. The centerpieces of 
this technology are the or
ganic light-emitting diodes 
(OLEDs).
Screens using OLEDs have 
paper-thin layers where dis
plays can be made of plastic. 
The colors on such screens, 
according to McCullough, 
turn out better than plas
ma.
The OLED technology 
improves upon the contem
porary liquid crystal display 
(LCD) technology by correct
ing for viewing angle prob
lems.
With LCDs, one cannot 
see the screen unless one is 
sitting directly in front of it, 
due partially to a series of 
liquid crystal pixels located 
behind the screen either 
allowing or prohibiting light 
produced by the device to 
pass through.
- In OLED technology, such 
liquid crystal pixels are not 
used, allowing much better 
visual effects while employ
ing little energy. Light emit
ting diodes have been in ex
istence for a while  similar 
technology is used in redlight clock radios  but only 
recently have they been made 
with organic materials.
Organic diodes require 
much less arduous work than 
do inorganic, which need to
be processed in a clean room.
Research has been a chal
lenging process. Swati Varshney, a senior chemistry major 
and member of McCulloughs 
research team, has worked 
on synthesizing materials for 
OLEDs and solar cells. She 
worked on a polymer that 
could emit a stable, bright 
white light. She modified 
the molecular structure of 
polyfluorene, a fluorescent 
blue substance that, despite 
having a high quantum yield, 
decomposes in current LED 
applications.
I modified the reaction 
to give living conditions, 
meaning we could get poly
fluorene molecules with uni
form chain length [so] that 
they can ... stack properly, 
said Varshney.
This means that the 
polymers could be more 
easily made into thin films 
to make OLEDs. When 
other reactive monomers
 simpler molecules  are 
added to polyfluorene, the 
reaction produces tunable 
colors. The result is a stun
ning visual. Another problem 
in the process was removing 
organic molecules from the 
gold circuit board responsible 
for printing the images.
Junior chemistry major 
Rebecca Potash worked on 
a deposition process that 
would detach organic mole
cules while leaving the circuit 
itself unaltered. By creating 
these thin, flexible electron
ics, the gold patterns can be 
backed directly onto the 
circuit while cutting down on 
cost and energy.
Television only scratches 
the surface in applicable 
technology, however.
OLED has the potential to 
improve any technology that 
uses high-resolution micro
displays, including computer 
screens and mobile phones.
In the future, McCullough 
and Hannah will look to com
mercializing OLEDs, as well 
as their solar cells and inks, 
while increasing their ef
ficiency and lowering their 
cost.
Solar cells have a prom
ising future. Instead of the 
traditional silicon, which is 
costly and time-consuming 
to use, organic molecules 
could be used to make solar 
cells effectively and cheaply. 
This would be, according to 
Varshney, especially useful 
for applications in develop
ing countries.
For example, solar-pow
ered OLEDs could provide 
low-cost lighting to children 
in sub-Saharan villages so 
that they could study past 
sunset after school or work, 
Varshney said, citing a pre
sentation from the Pople Lec
tures held at the Mellon Insti
tute in September.

Pandora Radio can be run in a web browser as shown, or as a standalone application. By categorizing music based on certain criteria, called 
"genes, Pandora will intelligently select music to play based on a listeners preferences.
ZACHARIAS GEORGE
Junior Staffwriter
Since its introduction in 
2005, Pandora Radio has 
steadily developed a strong 
following. Internet radio has 
been around since before 
Pandora, and many stations 
began to offer music recom
mendation services, gently 
directing the listener to other 
songs they might find inter
esting based on the tastes of 
other listeners.
Pandora Radio differs from 
other Internet radio stations 
in that song recommendations 
are unique to each user. Pan
dora allows its users to choose 
paths of music they find per
sonally tasteful. Notably, none 
of these recommendations are 
based on the preferences of 
other users.
The Music Genome Project 
was started in January 2000 
with the aim of studying all 
music at a fundamental level. 
The project aimed to catego
rize all music based on certain 
basic musical traits. Five years 
of research led to a means to 
do just what they set out to 
achieve. To date, the Music 
Genome Project has identi
fied nearly 400 musical traits. 
Some of these are commonly 
understoodacoustic rhythm
guitars, repetitive chorus  
while most others are more 
complex. These are referred to 
as genes. The project breaks 
down each song into its com
ponent genes. The genes may 
vary from song to song, with 
rock music having fewer genes 
than a classical piece.
Each of the selected genes 
is then assigned a value be
tween one and five in incre
ments of one-half, with higher 
values indicating a stronger 
presence of that particular 
musical trait.
The bank of songs that Pan
dora uses to select and make 
recommendations is called the 
library. This library, according 
to the Pandora team, consists 
mainly of English songs and 
has well over half a million 
songs, with more being add
ed every day. Approximately 
15,000 songs are added to the 
library every month. Before it 
is added to the library, a song 
is studied by a trained analyst 
who lists the various genes as
sociated with the song. The 
entire genetic structure of a 
song is identified in about 20 
minutes.
Knowing the genes of a 
particular song, a computer 
creates a simulated spatial 
representation. This is done 
by a classifier program. The
function of this program is to 
identify the song by its spatial 
genetic representation. When 
a listener inputs a personal fa
vorite, the system studies the 
characteristics of the song and 
creates a vector based on its 
genes. This vector then points 
to the next song having similar 
genes arranged in space in a 
similar manner. In addition to 
this method of recommending 
songs to the listener, Pandora 
allows the listener to provide 
feedback to the program, in
dicating an interest or dislike 
for a particular song. Allowing' 
the program to recommend 
songs without providing any 
feedback to it can result in 
highly varied song recom
mendations. A rock song 
could theoretically point to a 
classical music piece. The rec
ommendations allow the user 
to remain within the general 
area of their personal musical 
interests.
Submitting a Thumbs 
Up vote causes the program 
to select and play songs that 
more closely resemble the 
song currently playing, while 
a Thumbs Down vote bans 
the song from the station tem
porarily and also avoids simi
lar music when making new 
recommendations. Another 
constraint on the songs played
stems from the music license 
issues. Pandora is not allowed 
to play songs on demand, re
play songs, or play more than 
four songs by the same artist 
in an hour. Songs cannot be 
skipped more than six times 
an hour or more than 20 times 
in a day, depending on the 
kind of subscription.
As Pandora depends on a 
human analyst  at present, 
at least  the costs incurred 
are higher than most other 
Internet radios. To counter 
this problem, Pandora Radio 
offers a free as well as paid lis
tening experience. The former 
allows only 40 hours of music 
a month interspersed with ad
vertisements.
Pandora Radios Internet 
presence allows it to be highly 
accessible by todays genera
tion of mobile phone users. 
Over time, Pandora has cre
ated a number of desktop 
gadgets and applications for 
phones to allow listeners to 
tune in on the go.
Tim Westergren, the found
er of Pandora Radio, told the 
Chicago Tribune how effective 
releasing a single Pandora 
mobile phone application 
was. Within the first 10 days 
of releasing the application in 
July 2008, Pandora listeners 
doubled to 40,000 a day.

fMLItLUiMoving off campus may not be as attractive as it seems
Maria Raffaele/Assistant Art Editor
New research caf a boon for CMU, Pittsburgh
Congratulations to the 
Social and Decision Sci
ence Department on get
ting press: The Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette covered the 
opening of its CMU Re
search Caf downtown, 
an initiative of the Center 
for Behavioral Decision 
Research (CBDR). The fa
cility took three rooms on 
the second floor of Fifth 
Avenue Place that used to 
hold a Sam Goody store 
and transformed it into a 
space that benefits Carn
egie Mellon, its students, 
Highmark (the main ten
ant of the building), and
the vendors providing the 
food.
Of course, the CBDR has 
already made use of an un
usual strategy for getting 
the citizens of Pittsburgh 
involved with its studies: 
The Data Truck was rolled 
out in June 2007 to travel 
around Pittsburgh and 
perform studies with large 
crowds (Steelers games 
and shopping malls). This 
resource is important for a 
highly varied sampling of 
subjects  an important 
aspect of any fair study  
which is not readily avail
able on a college campus.
The introduction of the 
caf adds another, even 
more attractive option 
to take advantage of this 
same resource.
With all the hype about 
this new research caf  
CMU news and H&SS are 
all a-Twitter with excite
ment  its easy to get 
caught up in celebration. 
And why not? Not only 
will CMU researchers ben
efit, but the Pittsburgh 
economy will as well. Like 
the Waffle Shop is do
ing for East Liberty, this 
CMU-specific locale will 
draw more students down
town. Its location in Fifth 
Avenue Place makes it an 
easy place for those work
ing in the building to drop 
by for a bite, meaning that 
students get the benefit 
of more subjects and the 
vendors get the benefit of 
more diners.
Ultimately, this caf is 
a fantastic idea  it gets 
the public to the research
ers who need an unbiased 
sampling for the best re
sults, and it can only help 
make Carnegie Mellon 
look more innovative as it 
spreads further into Pitts
burgh.
Mayors Fair Share tax an unfair burden on students
Mayor Ravenstahl has 
been re-elected, and now 
he wants Carnegie Mel
lon students to pay more 
than $400 extra each year 
because the city of Pitts
burgh needs to balance its 
budget.
This one percent tax 
targets post-secondary 
tuition, which is basi
cally any college student 
in Pittsburgh, and because 
Carnegie Mellon students 
already have high tuition 
costs, under this budget 
measure, wed be paying 
the highest tax.
A large portion of the 
funds would help cover
higher pension costs  
costs that college stu
dents do not benefit from 
 and a little of it would 
help keep neighborhood 
branches of the Carnegie 
Libraries from closing. To 
justify this tax, the mayor 
has said that the city can 
no longer provide city ser
vices to those who are not 
paying their fair share. 
However, we students do 
contribute to Pittsburghs 
economy  we go out to 
eat at restaurants and we 
spend money at local and 
chain retailers.
Mayor Ravenstahl also 
said that this is a fair
way to share the burden 
of paying for public ser
vices. Clearly something* 
isnt fair. Why should the 
tax be based on the tu
ition of an institution; are 
Carnegie Mellon students 
the biggest freeloaders of 
the city? Carnegie Mel
lon students are already 
burdened with the large 
amount of tuition we pay, 
and this only adds to our 
troubles. This added price 
could prevent prospec
tive students from coming 
to Carnegie Mellon and 
Pittsburgh would be miss
ing out on some of the best 
talent from around the
world. Carnegie Mellon 
University was just named 
a Best Neighbor to the 
city of Pittsburgh because 
of our positive impact on 
the community, including 
commercial and residen
tial activities. Maybe the 
mayor missed that issue of 
The Tartan.
Instead of taxing our 
education, perhaps the 
mayor should embark on a 
plan to bring more people 
to the city, and encourage 
college students , to stay 
after graduating. Creating 
more taxes on the popula
tion of college students will 
only drive people away.
New $7M land purchase needs to prove its usefulness
According to a Nov. 10 
press release, Carnegie 
Mellon has just agreed to 
spend $7.5 million on a 
half-acre plot of land that 
previously housed a gas 
station. The land, located 
on Forbes Avenue east of 
Craig Street but west of the 
Collaborative Innovation 
Center on campus, could 
serve as a bridge from the 
main campus buildings 
to the small Craig Streetbased commercial district 
so heavily populated by 
Carnegie Mellons stu
dents.
With an ever-expanding
student population and a 
need to keep up with its 
top academic competitors, 
it makes sense for Carn
egie Mellon to want to buy 
more land and physically 
expand its main campuss 
grounds. But is spending 
$7 million on a plot of land 
that will likely sit empty for 
years the most financially 
viable option for a univer
sity whose own president 
has expressed concern 
over the institutions finan
cial woes?
Moreover, following, 
the universitys plan for 
expansion as outlined by
the Campus Design and 
Facilities Development 
master plan, new physical 
development of the cam
pus looks more spread-out 
than dense. While it is im
portant and impressive that 
this plan exists, and that it 
is more or less consistently 
evaluated and updated, 
the scope of development 
for Carnegie Mellon might 
not be thinking enough 
about the landscape of the 
Oakland region and city at 
large. As we become less 
of an industrial urban area 
and more of a technologydriven, education-based
urban powerhouse, our 
architecture should re
flect this: We need denser, 
taller buildings. We need 
to build upon what we 
have  we can have taller 
buildings on campus; we 
can go underground; we 
can expand upon already 
sprawling parking lots and 
open areas on campus.
While more develop
ment in any way is good 
for the university and will 
draw more people to the 
city of Pittsburgh, it is im
perative that these chang
es reflect the direction of 
the university itself.
I know its a little early to be 
thinking about this, but if you are 
considering moving out of those 
smelly, cramped, noisy, and expen
sive dorms, this piece is meant for 
you. Anything, you might be think
ing, anything will be better than a 
minuscule room in which you cant 
even fit all your belongings. Any
thing would be better than having to 
use earplugs at night to block out the 
noise coming from that Guitar Hero 
party next door. Anything would be 
better than having to carry all those 
pots and pans into a kitchen at the 
other end of the dorm only to find 
that someone else is already cook
ing.
This was exactly my argument 
when I gave up my room in Morewood Gardens for a beautiful little 
studio apartment. I fell in love with 
the place when I saw it. It had its 
own little balcony, and best of all, 
it was cheaper than a prime double 
in Morewood. To top it all, it was a 
short 15-minute walk to campus; the 
Escort shuttle stopped right in front 
of the apartment; and the landlord 
was a nice old man who even offered 
to lend me his mothers old crockery. 
Perfect ending, you say? Well, Ive 
been living here for a semester now 
and have a different story to tell.
No, I dont have plumbing prob
lems; my landlord didnt suddenly 
turn evil; I didnt find out that the 
apartment was breaking apart  
everything is actually quite perfect. 
What Ive realized over the course of 
the semester is that I miss the cam
pus life. I know it is partly because 
of the person I am  I like to come 
back home after classes, change into 
my PJs and curl up on my couch and 
study  and that someone who 
takes conscious efforts to be on cam
pus and come back to the apartment 
at 3 or 4 a.m. will have a different 
take on this. But if you are like me, 
you should think about this decision 
more carefully.
My little room in Morewood was 
always more full than this spacious 
apartment usually is. I always had 
someone popping in, whether it was 
the RA telling me to come to a house 
event or my friend from across the 
hall coming in to tell me how her day
was. Although I disliked these inter
ruptions when I was trying hard to 
study, they livened up my day.
The only time anyone has 
knocked on my apartment door has 
been when Ive invited them to come 
over. The only time Ive had more 
than two people in the apartment 
is when Ive thrown parties in here, 
which, with this being CMU and 
CMU students being CMU students, 
has been thrice this semester.
Apart from friends and people 
in general, I miss campus itself. Be
ing a junior biology major, I spend 
most of my weekdays in the Mellon 
Institute which, despite being a part 
of Carnegie Mellon, is 20 minutes 
away from the main parts of cam
pus. Since Mellon is a mere five min
utes away from my apartment, I had 
initially found the decision to move 
here all the more appealing.
I have two classes on campus 
and they are in Doherty and Por
ter halls. Anyone who knows how 
to cut through Newell-Simon Hall 
would know that you wont even 
see the Fence if all you do is wait 
through Newell-Simon, attend your 
classes, and rush back to your next 
class at the Mellon Institute. So ba
sically, the first day when I walked 
to campus from the front side, I was 
surprised to see the Walking to the 
Sky pole being taken apart. The next 
time I walked, it was there again. I 
miss walking to campus looking at 
the announcements chalked all over 
the sidewalks. I miss walking out of 
Doherty Hall to the sight of numer
ous tables filled with candy, brown
ies, pamphlets, apples, and anything 
else you could imagine. In short, I 
just miss our campus that is always 
full of so much life.
I know that my case is quite spe
cific. Im not expecting everyone 
making this decision to be a Hunt Li
brary-avoiding person who is forced 
to stay in Mellon Institute, but you 
have to carefully think everything 
out before making this decision. 
Moving off campus is a big change, 
so take time to decide whether this is 
something you really want. You have 
nearly an entire semester to make 
this decision; think about what you 
want and make sure that you wont 
regret your decision later.
Akanksha Vaidya (awaidya@J miss
es almost everything about dorm life 
except those Guitar Hero parties, and 
is glad to be away from that, at least.
Alum shares opinion on tax
I will not ever be in a position to 
pay Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahls proposed 1 percent college 
tuition tax, but I must decry its un
fairness.
Taxing college tuition will place 
an even greater burden on strug
gling students and the families who 
want them t receive the best edu
cation they can afford. At pricey in
stitutions of higher learning, the tax 
could amount to more than $500 per 
year, a highly significant sum which 
would be a hardship to many.
At the federal level, wage-earning, investment, and saving, activi
ties that we should be encouraging, 
are taxed, and there is a great push 
in this Presidential administration to 
impose additional burdens on those 
whose hard work and ingenuity have 
made them successful.
In our high-tax, big-government 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 
Governor Rendell continues to sup
port the imposition of a uniquely
cruel and savage death/inheritance 
tax, which steals from the graves of 
decedents 4.5 to 15 percent of ev
ery dollar of inheritance, the only 
exemption being for a surviving 
spouse.
Mayor Ravenstahl would make 
a similar mistake at the local level, 
providing a disincentive to engage in 
the laudable pursuit of higher edu
cation.
Pittsburgh has driven itself into 
a fiscal ditch through poor steward
ship of public dollars. Local college 
students did not contribute to these 
wounds, and they should not be 
called upon to bail out those who 
mismanaged the public purse.
Would Pittsburghs sports-ob
sessed mayor ever propose a new 
tax on hockey, football, and baseball 
tickets to stanch the flow of red ink? 
Not a chance!

Brazilian student expelled for short skirt
Lanas prosprefarsLeaders urge action on new tax
Weve all heard the widely propa
gated stereotypes about women in 
Latin America  namely, the way 
they dress. I know the pictures that 
are popping to the front of your 
minds right now  nude beaches, or 
barely-there bikinis, women provoca
tively swinging their hips while they 
sashay down the street. While this 
article isnt meant to either further or 
diminish those stereotypes, it actu
ally describes a situation that clearly 
goes against anything even remotely 
associated with them.
Last month, Geisy Arruda, a 
20-year-old student at the privately 
owned Bandeirante University in Sao 
Bernardo de Campo, outside of Sao 
Paulo, wore a short, hot pink mini
skirt to classes, which incited major 
ridicule and taunting from her fellow 
students and eventually led to her 
expulsion and then reinstatement. 
The university took further action 
by taking out advertisements in local 
newspapers that publicly decried her 
immorality, according to an article 
from the Associated Press. Videos of 
the humiliation that Arruda endured 
as she was escorted from campus by 
the police, covered up with a profes
sors white lab coat, can be seen on 
YouTube and were played on many 
major Brazilian television stations. 
Arruda has been told she will be al
lowed back to the university, but she 
has not yet stated whether or not she 
will do so, citing safety concerns, ac
cording to the same AP article.
I know that as Carnegie Mellon 
students, weve seen our fair share 
of, lets say, differently dressed stu
dents. I will never forget walking into 
Wean Hall my first year and seeing 
someone dressed as a Teenage MuSAY.M! , ;________ .Anti-evolution statement published in Darwins text
On Nov. 19, a California-based 
religious organization says that it is 
coming to Carnegie Mellon to hand 
out copies of Charles Darwins On 
The Origin of Species, edited to in
clude a 50-page introduction. This 
addition essentially claims that the 
theory of evolution caused Nazism, 
the field of biology is populated by 
dishonest frauds, and that if you be
lieve the scientific evidence for evo
lution, then you are stupid.
Someone has written a 50-page 
introduction to On the Origin of Spe
cies to prove he has never read On 
the Origin of Species. This introduc
tion, currently available in full on 
the website of Living Waters Min
istries (check the tab next to their 
merchandise section), also takes 
a sentence here and there to com
pare being gay to terrorism and to 
call Buddhism a religion of denial. 
Who is it thats bringing such state
ments to campus under the guise of 
reasoned debate? None other than 
Ray Comfort, who you may recall 
from the infamous Banana: Proof 
of God video on YouTube. Think 
of it as the theological equivalent 
of Fat Kid with Lightsaber. Comforts other works include Evolution: 
A Fairy-Tale For Grownups, Militant 
Evangelism, and the 1991 classic 
Russia Will Attack Israel, in which he 
apparently foresaw a Soviet invasion 
of the state of Israel to trigger the 
battle for Armageddon. Hopefully 
his latest work will be as prescient 
and thoughtful as the rest. The in
tent of this campaign is to distribute 
thousands of copies of the book (mi
nus a religiously inconvenient chap
ter or two) to young people across 
Americas top 100 college campuses. 
Carnegie Mellons secular student 
group  Atheists, Humanists, and 
Agnostics (aha!)  encourages all 
students to pick up a (free) copy of 
this 50-page personal attack on your 
intelligence, your personal beliefs, 
and your lifestyle if it is brought to 
campus this Nov. 19. That way, the 
next time anyone tries to pretend 
with a straight face that theres a 
real, reasonable debate between sci
ence and creationism, youll have 
it straight from the mouth of a cre
ationist that there is none.

Humanists, and Agnostics.
ROTIMI ABIMBOLA AND ADAM KLEIN
My fellow constituents, class
mates, and friends, it is time for us 
to organize.
Some of you may have heard 
about the 1 percent tuition tax 
that the recently re-elected mayor 
of Pittsburgh, Luke Ravenstahl, is 
pursuing.
Without going into a great 
amount of detail, the city needs 
about $15 million to boost its pen
sion and to help balance its bud
get.
The mayor says that college 
students place a major burden on 
many of the citys services and re
sources, and therefore, we should 
be taxed 1 percent of the cost of 
our tuition. If this bill passes, Pitts
burgh will be the first city to insti
tute such a tax.
What do we do now? Tuition 
costs increase every year, and Car
negie Mellon is one of the most 
expensive universities in the city. 
How do we show the mayor and 
the city council that we will take 
a major hit, financially, from this 
tax?
I have been in discussion with 
several students from different 
schools in the city, as well as ad
ministrators on our own campus, 
and I am hearing the same mes
sage: This should not be happen
ing. In a time of great economic 
uncertainty, the last thing we need 
is to be taxed for choosing to seek 
higher education in the city of 
Pittsburgh.
All affected students must 
speak up and take matters into our 
own hands.
This may be a great time for 
all of us to begin to learn about 
Pittsburgh politics and the ways 
in which our student experience 
in the city can be impacted. In the 
next week, you can expect to hear 
a lot of buzz around campus con
cerning this issue.
I ask that you tune in and find 
out what is going on and that you 
take an interest in an issue that 
could have a direct impact on your 
time here as students.
The only way that we can fight 
this is by showing the power that 
college students in Pittsburgh 
have.
We bring so much to this city
 we help local businesses, we 
do research, we do a tremendous 
amount of social work and commu
nity service, and so much more.
There will be more informa
tion concerning this tuition tax 
released to the entire campus later 
this week.
In, the meantime, get informed, 
tell a friend, call the city council, 
and be on the lookout for petitions 
outside of Doherty Hall.
tant Ninja Turtle  costume, mask, 
and all  with a piece of cake shoved 
around the mouth-hole of the mask, 
just laying, sprawled out, in the mid
dle of the floor right inside the main 
doors. After doing a double take to 
make sure my already sleep-deprived 
mind wasnt hallucinating (which it 
wasnt), I looked around to see how 
other people were reacting, and was 
greeted with complete and total in
difference. While I know that a TMNT 
costume isnt exactly the same thing 
as a hot pink miniskirt, I still cannot 
believe that the students in Brazil re
acted the way that they did.
Both the universitys and the stu
dents actions were inappropriate. 
Students of any age, no matter what 
country they go to school in, should 
know that taunting their classmates 
because of what they are wearing is 
wrong. While a few jokes or whistles 
could be expected  these are boys in 
college, after all  harassing some
one, yelling puta (whore) at them, 
and taunting them so much that 
they need a police escort to leave the 
building is completely unacceptable. 
Even if the skirt violated the schools 
dress code, thats an issue for the uni
versitys administration to deal with, 
not a matter that the students heed 
to take into their own hands. I just 
cannot imagine why a student wear
ing a miniskirt, no matter how short, 
would result in such mass chaos as 
Arrudas did.
The university did not take the 
correct course of action, either. As 
Arruda asserts in the AP article, she 
is the victim in the situation, not the 
perpetrator. She is the student that 
was attacked by her fellow class
mates. And yet, she is also the one 
that was punished. Not only did the 
university decide to expel her, but 
they also decided not to inform her 
directly; instead, Arruda learned of
her expulsion from the advertise
ments taken out in newspapers  
advertisements that claimed she was 
wearing inadequate clothing and 
that her attitude was too provocative 
for the school environment. Whether 
or not this is true (I doubt that it is
 its hard for me to imagine that Ar
rudas skirt was so short and her ac
tions so provocative that students felt 
that they couldnt learn), the univer
sitys first priority is still the safety of 
its students. It seems that Bandeirantes administration forgot this some
where along the way; probably at 
about the same time they purchased 
advertisements in newspapers to humiliate her further. Instead of help
ing to calm the situation and protect 
Arruda from any further danger, the 
university helped to make the situa
tion bigger, an action that was unnec
essary and childish.
I hope that the university sees the 
error of their ways, and helps to make 
Arruda feel safe enough to come back 
to school, because nothing should get 
in the way of obtaining an education, 
not even a little, pink piece of cloth.
Heather Tomko (Titomko@j honestly 
thinks her education would be more 
disrupted by someone in a TMNT cos
tume than someone in a miniskirt.

Unsportsmanlike conduct is expected in competitive sports
SPORTSMANSHIP, from A12
reflects todays simple philos
ophy in sports: If you can play, 
you are going to play. Those 
tasteless gestures mean little 
to the coach or the fan. They 
reflect you as a person, but if 
you can shoot three pointers 
or drive a ball 700 yards, you 
can keep that sailors mouth. 
There are consequences, but 
they are not nearly severe 
enough because the fans just 
do not care.
Are the students going to 
boycott football games be
cause their starting running 
back decided to start a post
game boxing match? Are fans 
going to stop paying ridicu
lous prices for tickets to the 
next game? The answer to 
both is a resounding no.
Speaking of fans, they are 
guilty as well. Sporting events 
have transformed from a day 
for the entire family to a guys 
day out at the bar. Try rooting 
for the Bengals at Heinz Field; 
if you do not attract racial 
slurs, swear words directed at 
your poor mother, or an invi
tation to a fight, you probably 
took the wrong exit on the 
expressway. The best part is, 
the fans still pay top dollar for 
a ticket.
In the huge business of 
sports, money drives every
thing, and if there is anything 
Hollywood can teach us, its 
that bad feelings equals more 
ratings. That only explains 
why the highlights of Phila
delphia Phillies pitcher Pe
dro Martinezs performances 
at Yankee Stadium are his 
plunking of Derek Jeter and 
his infamous takedown of 
then-Yankees bench coach 
Don Zimmer. Fans barely rec
ognize the 11 wins and 3.20 
ERA against the Yankees, of 
all teams.
. Lets face it  indecency in 
sports is here to stay, wheth
er the parents, motivational 
speakers, and old tradition
alists like it or not. Embrac
ing the idea would set sports 
back to the Russell Crowe 
[ITAL] Gladiator[ITAL] days. 
Scoffing at every unneces
sary touchdown dance gives 
you a seat at Bingo Night in 
the senior center. So for now, 
tolerance would be the best 
solution. This trend may die 
out like those attractive shortshorts of the NBA of yester
year. Or it could be the future 
of sports, where every players 
career can be chronicled in 
outrageous autobiographies 
and movies.
Whatever the result may 
be, this new age of indecency 
and bad sportsmanship has 
done some good for sports.
There is no bigger motiva
tion in sports than a kick in 
the face or a challenge to a 
players manhood. Sports fans 
would have missed out on the 
likes of basketball great Mi
chael Jordan. Fortunately, 
Jordan returned the favor by 
criticizing and belittling all 
his opponents and even some 
of his coaches and teammates 
in his Hall of Fame induction 
speech.
If Michael Jordan can 
teach us one thing other than 
his basketball skills, its that 
the jury is still out on this new 
book of sports etiquette. The 
future of sports will be the 
only determinant of the suc
cess or the failure of this era 
in sports. If successful, sports 
will continue to gain in popu
larity nd they may replace 
other entertainment indus
tries, such as movies. Failure 
of this era will turn sports into 
an obscure part of our culture 
followed by societal outcasts.
However, for now, its go
ing to be the same repetitive 
argument every time a sucker 
punch is thrown, a ponytail 
is pulled, or a bleeped out ti
rade is played on SportsCenter. Hopefully, this is start of 
what basketball enthusiast 
President Obama would call 
change we can believe in.

Cross 
country 
competes 
at Mideast 
Regional
On Saturday, the Carn
egie Mellon cross country 
team competed in the Mid
east Regional in Bethlehem, 
Pa. Hosted by Muhlenberg 
College, and with over 300 
athletes competing on both 
the mens and womens 
sides, the Tartans were set 
up for a competitive day. 
The men competed in an 
8k, placing second overall, 
while the women ran a 6k 
and came in seventh at the 
Regional. This being their fi
nal meet before NCAAs, the 
Tartans set out to achieve 
impressive results.
The top performances 
for the men came from 
sophomore Matt Jacob 
(third, 25:09), junior J.P. 
Allera (12th, 25:28), junior 
Dan Addis (14th, 25:31), 
junior Nate Bussiere (19th, 
25:39), and finally junior 
Justin Kurp (21st, 25:48).
Due to their outstand
ing results this season, the 
mens cross country team 
will continue on to NCAAs.
The women were not as 
successful, however, with 
only two Tartan runners 
in the top 15  first-year 
Emily Wobb (sixth, 21:54) 
and junior Courtney Baker 
(13th, 22:25).
Wobbs sixth place fin
ish at the Regional sets her 
up to receive an at-large in
dividual bid to compete at 
NCAAs.
The NCAA Division III 
Cross Country Champion
ship will be held next Satur
day in Cleveland, Ohio for 
both the men and women.
Cross countrys Emily Wobb runs on success
SARA WINGEN
Staffwriter
In only her first year at 
Carnegie Mellon, Emily Wobb 
is already making the most 
of life as a busy student ath
lete. Between balancing the 
challenging first courses of a 
major in fine arts and bond
ing with her dorm-mates over 
her projects, Wobb has been a 
top performer for the Tartan 
womens cross country team. 
Earlier this season, Wobb was
recognized by the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) as 
the Womens Cross Country 
Athlete of the Week when she 
finished first at the Waynesburg Invitational, helping the 
team take first place out of 
eight teams.
This past weekend, Wobb 
led the Tartans to a seventh 
place finish out of 44 teams at. 
the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association (NCAA) Mid
east Regional held at Muhlen
berg College.
Finishing in sixth place 
overall individually, Wobb 
earned an at-large bid to the 
NCAA Division III Womens 
Cross Country Championship 
meet and the chance to extend 
her superb season.
Cross country has served 
other purposes for Wobb be
sides giving her an outlet for 
athletic success. Although 
she tried lacrosse in middle 
school, Wobb gave cross coun
try a chance at the urging of 
her stepfather. She said, He
said he would leave it up to me 
to continue or not. After I ran 
my first race, I was hooked. 
Wobb said that the friend
liness and acceptance from 
her teammates and peers at 
Carnegie Mellon has given 
her more confidence to tackle 
her schoolwork, and that the 
schedule of practices and trav
eling to meets has allowed Her, 
to focus on time management. 
Wobb is also thankful for the 
nonjudgmental attitudes she 
has been greeted with from
the people she has met, which 
is one of the best things she 
has experienced so far in her 
first year of college.
After a strong first season 
with cross country, Wobb 
plans to stay involved with in
door and outdoor track. While 
she is still not sure where she 
would like to end up for a ca
reer, Wobb still has plenty of 
time to work hard at school 
and enjoy her impressive per
formances on the cross coun
try trails.

Tartans football 
loses to Maroons
FOOTBALL, from A12
Weve had a lot of ups 
and downs throughout this 
season. When we play at our 
best we can match up toe to 
toe with anyone, but at times 
we hurt ourselves and come 
up short. Im very satisfied 
with our season; we had a 
young team to start the year
and I think we proved our
selves week in and week out, 
Howe said.
Howe is also Carnegie 
Mellons single-season leader 
in receptions, tallying six for 
the game and ending the sea
son with 50 receptions.
The Tartans have finished 
competition for the year, and

Mens swimming 
and diving takes 1st, 
women's lose 138-158
DEVIN BEAHM
Staffwriter
The Tartans swimming 
and diving team competed 
at Grove City last Saturday. 
The women fell 138-158 
while the men were able to 
pull out a win with a score of 
176-124.
The team started out the 
individual events strong with 
sophomores Victoria Adams 
and Jen Sung placing first 
and second, respectively, in 
the 1000-yard freestyle. Se
nior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki 
also finished strong in the 
1000 freestyle, placing first 
by over 11 seconds. Team
mates first-year Brandon Yee 
and senior Gates Winkler fol
lowed in second and third.
Despite the sweeps, the 
Tartan men and women were 
surprisingly trailing going 
into the first diving break af
ter the 50 freestyle, prompt
ing team meetings. We were 
down ... coming into the first 
break, senior Sara Andrews 
said. When we found that 
out, we definitely came to
gether as a team by cheering 
and racing much better and 
harder.
Junior Molly Evans had 
three victories on the day, 
taking the 200-yard freestyle 
with a pool-record time of 
1:54.32 before winning the 
200 backstroke in 2:07.87 and 
the 400 individual medley in 
4:32.62. All three swims were 
provisional qualifying times 
for the 2010 NCAA champi
onships. First-year Dorothy 
Yu also scored points for the 
Tartans, placing first in the 
100 backstroke with a time 
of 1:01.80 and beating out 
Grove Citys Kate Wilt in the 
200-yard breaststroke by just 
over a second with a time of 
2:28.39. Sophomore Hannah 
Gonzalez tied the Wolverines 
Jenny Ryan in the 100-yard 
butterfly in 1:00.94.
Among other great swims 
for the Tartans were first-year 
Breanna Stillo placing second
in the 100 breaststroke, Gon
zalez and junior Rebecca Ussai finishing second and third 
in the 200 butterfly, respec
tively, and junior Brianne 
Burton finishing third in the 
50 freestyle. For the mens 
swim team, first-year Daniel 
Glaser-Garbrick had a solid 
race in the mens 200 butter
fly, placing first with a time of 
1:56.69 and also winning the 
mens 100 butterfly. Fellow 
teammate junior Alex Han
son also had a great day, win
ning the 200-yard backstroke 
and the 400 IM. Yee finished 
first in the 500 freestyle after 
barely touching second in a 
controversial 100 freestyle.
For the Tartans diving, 
sophomore Olivia DeFazio 
placed second with 179.25 
points in the 3-meter diving, 
and the mens team swept 
the competition, with se
nior Matt Kuhn placing first, 
sophomore Eli Fatsi taking 
second, and sophomore Mike 
Alexovich rounding out with 
third.
We had a rough start to 
the meet, but we really man
aged to turn it around in the 
second half, senior Jason 
Huber said. It was great 
to see the way the team re
ally rallied around each other 
and came together to win the 
meet. I think the performance 
of Brandon Yee in the 100 
free and again in the 500 as 
well as that of our backstrokers coming up with a really 
big 1-2-3 finish in the 200 
back really helped to get us 
back on track and jumpstart 
the team for the second half 
of the meet.
The Tartans swim team 
will next be in action oft Fri
day for their CMU Diving In
vitational, and the swim team 
will be hosting a tri-meet at 
home on Saturday against 
Washington and Lee and the 
University of Rochester at 11 
a.m.

Expectations were high for 
the mens soccer team as they 
went into the NCAA Division
III mens soccer tournament 
with an impressive 14-2-1 re
cord for the season and ranked 
second in the Great Lakes re
gion by the NCAA.
As a result of their success 
during the regular season, 
Carnegie Mellon was granted
the right to host the first two 
rounds of the NCAA tourna
ment. Carnegie Mellon played 
Thomas More College in the 
first round. The Tartans could 
also potentially get revenge 
on their Great Lakes rival, 
Ohio Wesleyan University, in 
the sectional finals, who two 
months ago gave Carnegie 
Mellon its worst defeat of the 
season.
Carnegie Mellons first 
match of the tournament
against Thomas More proved 
to be an exciting one. Right 
from the beginning, both 
teams came out playing a very 
fast-paced game in search of 
the first goal.
After some quick pressure 
from Thomas More, Carn
egie Mellon answered back 
by netting the first goal of the 
game. Senior forward and 
University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) Player of the Year 
Ricky Griffin was able to find
fellow senior Ryan Browne 
with a short pass behind the 
defense, and Browne was able 
to do the rest. To the Tartans 
surprise, Thomas More came 
back with an impressive attack 
themselves four minutes later, 
as Carnegie Mellon senior 
goalkeeper Maks Khurgin was 
forced to make a tough save. 
The Tartans were not able to 
take advantage of their onegoal lead as Thomas More was 
finally able to score in the 36th
minute.
The Tartans came out in 
the second half very eager to 
win the game and move on to 
the next round of the tourna
ment.
The Tartans elevated 
their level of play and tore 
up Thomas Mores back line
4 with some excellent passing. 
The buildup led to a great ef
fort by senior Pat Lutz to score 
Carnegie Mellons second goal 
of the game five minutes into
the second half. Browne got 
his second of the game in the 
65th minute and teammate 
senior Jon Simon secured the 
win four minutes later. Thom
as More got a consolation goal 
toward the end of the match 
and Carnegie Mellon went on 
to win 4-2.
Carnegie Mellon played 
their second round game in 
Gesling Stadium this past Sun
day. Details on the game will 
be available online Tuesday.
Mens basketball opens season with 65-70 loss to St. John Fisher
DEVIN BEAHM
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team hosted their 
first game on Sunday against 
St. John Fisher College, losing 
a close game 65-70. The start
ing line up consisted of senior 
co-captain Jack Anderson, 
juniors Matthew Pettit and 
Shane Rife, sophomore John 
Duhring, and first-year Chris
tian Shepley.
Other players who con
tributed to the team were se
niors Jon Wolleben and Dan 
Lavallee and first-year guard 
Andre Moore.
After the first half, the Tar
tans trailed St. John Fisher 
with a score of 27-39. The 
team fought back in the sec
ond half and caught up to the 
Cardinals with 8:38 left in 
the half, pushing the score to 
49-48.
Unfortunately, the Tartans 
couldnt hold off St. John Fish
er and ended the game with a 
score of 65-70.
Rife led the team with 11
rebounds to go along with 17 
points during his 36 minutes 
of play time. Pettit had 10 re
bounds and Duhring raked in 
six. Duhring and Anderson 
each played 34 minutes of the 
game, with Pettit playing 33 
and Shepley getting 27 min
utes on the court. Duhring 
hit two of his 11 three-point 
shots and Anderson made two 
of six. Anderson also led the 
team with 20 points during 
the game.
The Cardinals gave up 12 
turnovers during the game, 
while Carnegie Mellon only al
lowed seven.
Pettit observed during a 
pre-game discussion, Were 
all naturally excited for the 
game Sunday, being that it 
is the first game of the sea
son. After two scrimmages, 
we have picked up on a lot of 
our mistakes and look to bring 
more intensity this week lead
ing up to our game Sunday.
Anderson also commented 
on the game, I do believe that 
our team is prepared for our 
first game on Sunday. We have

worked extremely hard in the 
preseason, and have played 
two good scrimmages so far. 
We are excited to officially
start the season and to see our 
hard work begin to pay off. 
The Tartans hope their 
work pays off better next
Friday and Saturday at the 
Wooster Tournament held in 
Ohio.
The Tartans will play at 8

Good behavior on the court is 
secondary to producing wins
Football is defeated by Chicago 7-21 in final game of the season
FERMIN LIANG

Last week, womens col
lege soccer made national 
headlines, but not for a cham
pionship, an outstanding 
player, or even a long goal. 
Instead, it was a five-minute 
montage of University of New 
Mexico junior defender Eliza
beth Lambert kicking a ball 
at a defenseless opponent 
on the ground, punching an 
opposing player in the back, 
and  for the knockout blow
 pulling an opponent to the 
ground by her ponytail. That 
video of her ferociousness 
even made its way past ESPN 
to the likes of CNN and other 
news networks. Of course, the 
University of New Mexico sus
pended Lambert indefinitely 
for her actions.
The day after that an
nouncement, the University 
of Oregon reinstated their
running back LeGarrotte 
Blount for his incident after 
a loss at Boise State. During 
the post-game handshakes, 
Blount landed a punch to the 
face of a Boise State player. A 
few seconds later, while being 
escorted out of the stadium, 
he proceeded to start yelling 
at the home fans, threatening 
to charge into the stands. And 
heres the punch line: This 
was during college footballs 
Sportsmanship Week.
Unsportsmanlike behavior 
is even worse in the profes
sional ranks. In a game played 
in polo shirts and khakis, its 
greatest player Tiger Woods 
can be heard dropping Fbombs after a tee shot landing 
in the rough. Bill Belichick, 
the coach with the highest 
winning record of the New 
England Patriots, cannot 
even properly congratulate or 
shake hands with the oppos
ing coach after a loss.
And yet Blount still gets 
to play football for Oregon, 
Woods gets to win his majors, 
and Belichick is still regarded 
as one of the greatest coaches. 
With that, its only a matter of 
time before Lambert is rein
stated to her team.
All these stories have the 
same timeline. ESPN will 
play the clip at least 30 times 
during SportsCenter and 
its sports talk shows. Itll be 
discussed by the sports writ
ers and pundits the next day. 
Then, a public apology is is
sued by the offender or, for 
the inarticulate or unapologetic, through an agent. Then 
some governing body issues a 
fine or suspension. A month 
or so later, when everything 
has quieted down, the offend
er gets to return to his or her 
glory.
If anything, that timeline

The Carnegie Mellon 
football team traveled to the 
Windy City last Saturday for 
their season closer against 
University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) rival, University 
of Chicago. The Tartans fell 
to the Maroons with a score 
of 7-21, putting their season 
record at 5-5 and their UAA 
record at 1-2.
It was a scoreless first quar
ter, and Chicago tallied the 
first score of the game at the 
beginning of the second quar
ter. Chicago quarterback Mar
shall Olium connected with 
Dee Brizzolara for 28 yards 
and the touchdown. The extra 
point was good, putting the 
score at 0-7 with 14:11 left in 
the first half. The rest of the 
quarter was an equal battle 
and neither team scored.
Despite the scoreless first 
half for the Tartans, they were 
not deterred and remained 
positive, as senior wide receiv
er Brendan Howe explained, 
Our defense did a great job 
holding them to only seven 
points in the first half; unfor
tunately our offense couldnt 
get anything going. Coming 
out after halftime, we knew 
we were still in the game and 
just had to do a better job pro
tecting our quarterback and 
getting our running game 
moving.
Coming out of the halftime 
break, the Maroons had a 
quick score, again with Olium 
finding Brizzolara  this time 
on a pass for 42 yards. With 
8:20 left in the third quarter, 
Carnegie Mellon began to pick 
up momentum as the Cardinal 
and Gray made a 7-yard drive 
before pushing, Chicago to a 
drive of -1 yard.
Senior running back An
drew Lovrovich made several 
plays on the offensive end to 
spark the Tartans, until senior 
quarterback Phil Pantalone 
was sacked with 3:35 left in 
the quarter. Chicago picked 
up a quick seven points by the
end of the third, making the 
score 0-21.
The Tartans came out 
strong for the final quarter. 
Capitalizing on a penalty 
called on Chicago for pass 
interference, sophomore run
ning back Chris Garcia and 
junior fullback Justin Pratt 
rushed for 8 and 3 yards, re
spectively, to pick up the first 
down. On the next play, Pan
talone found Howe for 19 
yards and the touchdown. Ju
nior kicker Elliot Carnevales 
attempt was solid and the 
Tartans were on the board, 
7-21. Carnegie Mellons de
fense was able to stop Chi
cago from scoring for the rest 
of the game, but the Tartans 
offense could not make any 
gains either, even with a 38- 
yard drive.
Despite the loss to con
clude the season, the Tartans 
are happy with how it devel
oped.

Rogers, Masloff inaugurate museums new building
Shortly after 10 a.m. last Saturday, the ToonSeum, 
Pittsburgh's cartoon museum, opened the doors of 
its new location in the Cultural District, Downtown. 
About 25 visitors, mostly teenage boys, stood 
outside the entrance waiting for the ribbon to be 
cut and the new space to be unveiled. Joe Wos, 
executive director of the ToonSeum, spoke to the 
group before the event about the evolution of the 
museum from occupying a wing of the Childrens 
Museum of Pittsburgh on the North Side to moving 
into its own space.
After Wos speech, ToonSeum president and 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorial cartoonist Rob  
Rogers (CFA 84) introduced former Pittsburgh 
mayor Sophie Masloff to perform the ribbon cutting. 
The dynamic between the two entertained the 
group, as Rogers had spent much of Masloffs time 
in office caricaturing the mayor. The ceremony was 
soon complete, and the ToonSeum staff welcomed 
visitors into their new home.
The opening exhibit of the new ToonSeum appeals 
to both new cartoonists and those with decades 
of memories. This exhibit, Enchanted Drawings:
A Century of Animation, even has something to 
offer visitors who are not comic enthusiasts. The 
collection includes such varied works as concept art 
for the Batmobile and pencil drawings of Dora the 
Explorer. Walking through the museum is like taking 
a trip through the development of some of the most 
beloved and iconic images in popular media. Also . 
included is an animation desk from Disneys early 
Hyperion Studio, above which hangs a drawing of 
Donald Duck.
Soon after the grand opening on Saturday, a 
more varied crowd started to filter through the 
1000-square-foot museum. Patrons had the 
opportunity to talk to Masloff and Rogers, both of 
whom stayed to talk about the museum and sign 
Rogers new book  No Cartoon Left Behind. Some 
visitors remarked that they had come to know 
Masloff through the drawings of Rogers. Across the 
room, Wos drew personalized cartoons for visitors.
While its new space is a significant improvement 
over the old location, the museum still tries to fit a 
lot of content into a small space. With the visitors, 
press, and special guests that were present for 
the grand opening, the exhibit hall felt cramped at 
times, but on a normal day patrons will have plenty 
of room to admire the cartoons on the walls and the 
personal atmosphere.
According to its website, the ToonSeum is one of 
only three museums in the United States focusing 
on the cartoon arts  the other two are in New 
York City and San Francisco. While it was originally

supported by its home in the Childrens Museum, 
its move is being financed largely by the Grable 
Foundation.
In recent months, the ToonSeum has collaborated,
 with other cultural institutions in the city. During 
the G-20 summit in September, it co-sponsored the 
Drawn to the Summit exhibition at The Andy Warhol 
Museum (see An artistic look at the G20," from the, 
Sept. 21, 2009 edition of The Tartan).
While the ToonSeum will not attract the crowds of 
visitors that the Carnegie Museums do, it still hopes 
to find its niche in Pittsburghs unique culture. The 
new location in the Cultural District means that 
passersby will be able to walk in and learn about 
a century of animation. Amateur and professional 
cartoonists alike will have a location to meet others 
and refine their craft. Like any small art museum, the 
ToonSeum will succeed with a small and dedicated 
group. In this case, however, anybody can walk 
through the museum and develop an appreciation 
for the art of animation.

When a couple decides 
to break up, why does 
everyone around have 
to suffer? My two good 
friends were dating for 
a very long time  the 
perfect couple, or so I 
thought. They broke up 
two years ago, but my 
best friend still doesnt 
approve of me hanging 
out with her ex. Its been 
such a long time, and 
both of them have moved 
on in their own ways by 
dating other people. So 
why must I, a person who 
isnt even directly involved 
in the breakup, pick a side 
or compromise on my 
friendship with the other?
Stuck in the Middle
Dear Stuck,
Didnt it just seem like an 
ideal situation when your best 
friends were dating? Anyway,
I think your best friend just 
feels uncomfortable around 
her ex. However, you should 
explain to her that her ex is 
your friend, too, and as much 
as you love her, you would 
rather not have to choose 
between the two.
You should probably not 
encourage her ex to bring a 
current girlfriend to events 
with your best friend and 
vice versa. It takes a while for 
people to get comfortable in 
such situations. Try keeping 
out of their breakup  you 
are entitled to your opinion 
and your friendship, both of 
which are independent of the 
other.
Time heals everything, 
Prerna
I cant get myself to 
sleep soundly anymore. 
Every night I go to bed 
and wake up a few hours 
later. Sometimes I feel like 
I am wasting time while

tired, but it hasnt helped. 
I have tried the whole 
movie-and-heavy-snack

work. What should I do?
Student Needs 
Overnight Rest, Easily!
Dear SNORE,
The usual advice column 
answer would be: Dont 
drink caffeine too late; dont 
work out after 4 p.m.; have 
a stable sleeping schedule; 
and so on. However, being 
college students, we know 
that advice is hardly realistic.
So, lets get to the 
suggestions that fit the bill: 
Dont do any really exciting 
activity before going to bed. 
If the noise down the street is 
keeping you awake, get an air 
purifier to make white noise 
or a fan in the summer. Dont 
think about stressful topics; 
instead, just relax and think of 
something soothing. Usually,
I like to recap a nice episode 
of my day or just imagine 
something that makes me 
happy and peaceful. If this 
still doesnt work, I suggest 
you find a history book and 
start reading. Nothing calls' 
sleep faster than an extremely 
dull book.
Good night,
Prerna

Tales from abroad: Italy
Living by the beach, tasting gourmet dishes, and teaching children English
Arrive in San Remo, Italy by 6 p.m. June 1 with minimal 
traveling luggage. These were the instructions I 
received upon my acceptance as an English tutor with 
the Associazione Culturale Linguistica Educational 
(A.C.L.E.), based in northern Italy.
The organization was looking for young native English 
speakers from around the world to spend a summer 
leading camps for Italian children throughout the 
country. Although I have studied Italian at Carnegie 
Mellon for the past five semesters, the organization 
preferred to have students not familiar with the Italian 
language in order to force the children to practice their 
English skills. After one week of orientation aimed at 
familiarizing the tutors with interactive learning, we 
were broken into smaller groups and sent by train to 
towns somewhere in Italy.
At the train station, tutors were received by the camp 
director for that week. At that time, the tutors would be 
informed of their housing situation. I was fortunate to 
experience many different types of living situations. For 
my first camp, I got to live with a family in a house close 
to the school where the camp was held. The first night, I 
was introduced to the entire family  the mother, father, 
daughter, aunt, uncle, grandparents, and cousins  for 
an elaborate dinner authentic to Abruzzo.
The next week, my fellow tutors and I were given keys to 
a flat, right on the beach. Although I didnt get my meals
cooked by an Italian grandmother or have my clothes 
washed that week, every afternoon after camp was a 
relaxing evening on the beach with my new friends.
When I thought that I had found paradise, I was met 
with the biggest surprise of the summer. Week three 
had me staying in a five-star resort on the Sorrento 
coastline, overlooking the beautiful island of Llsola di 
Capri. Beyond the delicious food we had for lunch and 
dinner in the restaurant attached to the resort, our resort 
apartment had a theater setup, three bedrooms, two 
bathrooms, and a kitchen. There was nothing better 
than sitting by the pool with a book after camp and 
watching the sunset over the water. It was all too good to 
be true; the organization paid for travel expenses, living 
expenses, and would pay each tutor a couple hundred 
euro each week for their work.
I use the word work very loosely when describing my 
summer experience. Each morning would begin with
1 greeting the campers (who ranged from six to 16 years 
old) and a group game, song, or warm up. After that, the 
campers would break into their smaller classes, where 
the tutors would lead a lesson on a grammatical topic. 
Lunch was served in a cafeteria and lasted anywhere 
from one to two hours. After lunch we would once again 
break into smaller groups and work on "Show Practice." 
Every Friday, the campers would put on a short show 
in English for parents and community members. The 
show was a great way to get each camper involved and.
comfortable speaking in English. I hate to admit it, but 
sometimes I would feel sentimental after working with 
an incredibly talented or endearing group of campers. 
Students in any discipline would benefit from the 
experience I was able to enjoy. Although tutoring Italian 
children in English has next to nothing to do with my 
information systems major, I was able to fully immerse 
myself in a foreign culture. The tutors I worked with and 
befriended came from countries all around the world: 
England, Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New 
Zealand, and Canada are only some of the countries 
that sent tutors to the program. Eventually I adapted to 
talking with someone from Britain by describing where I 
go to uni and what I study.
By living with Italian families, it is possible to see the 
country from an Italian perspective. One week, I stayed 
with a top-rated chef in the Brescia region and ate the 
most expensive, delicious meal of my life at Vittorios 
elite restaurant with him and his family.
If you are interested in pursuing a similar experience, 
feel free to e-mail me at rh@cmu.edu or visit the A.C.L.E. 
website at www.acle.org.

CD dropbox Paperhouse
New releases from Swltchfoot and Dashboard Confessional m nllim On moving music
Among the many new album releases coming out 
this winter, Switchfoot and Dashboard Confessional 
are two relatively big names that, though not new to 
the music scene (Switchfoots first CD was released 
in 1997, Dashboards in 2000), are still producing 
fresh music. i 
JThe boys of Switchfoot released their seventh album, 
Hello Hurricane, this past Tuesday. The San Diego 
group has been able to mix guitar-driven pop-rock 
songs and heartfelt ballads on the same CD for the 
past decade, and Hello Hurricane is no exception. 
This is the bands seventh studio album and it 
comes just under two years after their previous 
release, Ohl Gravity, which was met with mixed 
reviews.
If some of the lyrics seem to allude to religion, its 
no accident. Foremans a devoted Christian, and 
he allows his beliefs to influence his music, but not 
define it. "Calling us Christian rock tends to be a 
box that closes some people out and excludes them. 
And thats not what were trying to do, he said in 
an interview with the Boston Globe, regarding the 
pigeonholing of a band to a genre.
If youre looking for a 49-minute undulation of 
sounds, then Hurricane is definitely for you. 
Foremans rough voice suits th heavier songs 
(Mess of Me, Bullet Soul), but turns soft  and

Switchfoot's lead singer Jon Foreman's versatile

still powerful  as he croons about life and love 
("Enough to Let Me Know, "Always). When 
Hurricane's songs lack guitar riffs, they are quickly 
made up by Foremans inspirational, mature, and 
poetic words.
Sure, the band tried to change their style a bit this 
time around, but Hurricane is powerful enough to 
attract new listeners and keep old fans smiling.
Also released this past Tuesday was Dashboard 
Confessionals latest project, Alter the Ending. Its 
the bands sixth album, though frontman Chris 
Carrabba also sang with the band Further Seems 
Forever, formed before Dashboards beginnings.
Time has allowed Carrabba to mature not only 
vocally, but also lyrically. In the bands early years, 
they were often labeled as the face of emo music, 
but with their recent releases, theyve gained a 
wider audience. With Alter the Ending, the band 
keeps some of its signature summery motifs (We 
watched the sun burn down into cinders) while 
extending into somber metaphors about sticking 
together (Therell be ash and dust to bury us but I 
will keep you clean).
There are some "typical Dashboard songs for the 
fans  simple arrangements of verses with gradual 
build-ups to a peppy, catchy chorus where Carrabba 
tells the world, Life is always hard for the belle of 
the boulevard.
Songs like Water and Bridges and I Know About  
You reflect the albums being more guitar-driven 
than previous releases (most notably, 2007s The 
Shade of Poison Trees, which featured a total, barebones, stripped-down, start-to-finish acoustic set 
list), but the change isnt overwhelming, as every 
song dedicates itself to its words and vocals.
After the band takes listeners on 39 minutes of a 
musical journey, Dashboard sends them off with 
the pleasant closer, Hell on the Throat, which 
introduces strings into the albums instrumentation. 
And so Alter the Ending ends, unless listeners have 
picked up the deluxe edition, which has a second 
disc in which the band performs acoustic versions of 
all 12 songs.
Check out the bands that brought you Dare You 
to Move and Screaming Infidelities in their 2009 
new releases. Hello Hurricane and Alter the Ending 
are two thumbs-up albums that are definitely worth 
a listen.

If sex is considered as impersonal as a handshake, Im 
worried about what people are coming to think of music. The 
MP3 has been getting around for almost a decade now. In the 
beginning, MP3s moved through a point of contact; people 
exchanged mixed CDs looking for new music. People talked 
about their musical choices. They exchanged their musical 
intuitions. It was wonderful; it was convenient; and it never 
cost anything.
Nowadays, moving music around is so much less personal. 
People are searching through the Internet reading blogs, 
articles, Tumbles, and Tweets, searching for good music 
instead of sitting down and finding it themselves. Any song 
can be found and downloaded off some file-sharing website 
on the Internet. Its all too cheap.
People arent finding new music together. With sex, at least 
someone else is there, but with music, were looking for 
action from something as impersonal as a computer.
?
Music has become a private affair  almost too self-indulgent. 
People arent exploring their boundaries. Theyre just finding 
more and more of what they already know they like. What 
are we going to do next? Take music off MP3s and remix it 
ourselves?
Obviously, thats what weve come to do. Remixes and 
samples abound in music right now. Its getting a little old now, 
though. Originally, remixes seemed like compliments to an 
artist; remixes were your personal connection to your favorite 
musician. Now, however, remixes are getting produced on an 
assembly line with a standardized set of instructions. What is 
the definitive sound of this generation?
Im almost afraid to say it, but this last decade of music is 
going to be known for the technology. Music seems to be 
amalgamating into some indefinable blurb. Over the last 10 
years, no artist has really grabbed our attention. The big 
bands we hear now are the same ones we listened to back in 
the early 90s. This generation has gone to the MP3 and the 
MP3 moves songs around like a musical prostitute.

AB brings hip hop to Carnegie Mellon
Aesop Rock and opening performers The Cool Kids rocked Wiegand Gym last Saturday
Saturday night, hip hop lyricist Aesop Rock performed at 
Wiegand Gym, and opening for him was a hip hop duo 
from the Midwest  The Cool Kids.
The Cool Kids is an alternative hip hop group consisting 
of two young men, Antoine Mikey Rocks" Reed and 
Evan "Chuck Inglish Ingersoll. The band took the stage 
and began their performance with some of their wellknown songs. The audience members played their part 
and sang along, screaming and making the concert 
memorable. The Cool Kids even gave the audience a 
taste of the music that will be coming out with their new 
album, which is scheduled to be released in spring 2010. 
Look for The Cool Kids new album and hear their music 
on MySpace at www.myspace.com/thecoolkids.
Following a great performance, Aesop Rock took the 
stage and put on another fantastic show. The hip hop 
artist was originally born Ian Matthias Bavitz in 1976 in 
Long Island, N.Y., and emerged during the new wave 
of underground and alternative hip hop during the 
late 1990s and early 2000s. He is currently signed to 
Definitive Jux label and is a member of The Weathermen. 
He says that the name Aesop came from a character 
he played in a movie, and it stuck. The rock part came 
from being in so many of his rhymes.
Aesop Rock is a very unique artist and has tattoos on his 
forearms: The one on the left arm says Must Not Sleep, 
and the one on the right says Must Warn Others. He 
takes these lines from the 1956 sci-fi movie Invasion of 
the Body Snatchers and used them in his lyrics in the 
chorus of his song Commencement at the Obedience 
Academy.
Aesops lyrics are sometimes seen as complex and 
abstract, but the interpretation is subjective. Different 
styles and kinds of people showed up to hear his 
performance, and he captured the crowd, getting the 
audience swaying and bopping to his lyrics. Even if its 
not laid out in perfect sentences  is any rap?  youd 
have to be an idiot to not at least grasp a few things from 
these songs. Or have had no interest in pulling anything 
from them in the first place, he said, commenting on his 
lyrical style.
Aesop Rocks music is available for all to hear on his 
MySpace page at www.myspace.com/aesoprockwins 
along with several videos that give the fans an inside 
look into who he is off stage.

Drama department gets down to business
Carnegie Mellon drama students debut How to Suceed in Business Without Really Trying
The business world of the 1950s was apparently rife with 
men who did nothing but spit out a lot of pretty words  
at least according to Shepherd Mead in How to Succeed 
in Business Without Really Trying. The book, originally 
published in 1952, satirized the corporate sector by 
reminding the reader that his attractive secretary may 
have been placed with him as a test, as someone may be 
interested in her career and wanted to tempt him.
The satirical humor was brought to life in a 1961 musical 
adaptation of the same name by Abe Burrows, Jack 
Weinstock, and Willie Gilbert. Last weekend, How 
to Succeed... opened in the Philip Chosky Theater to 
uproarious laughter.
In the play version, Meads original ideas were employed 
by J. Pierrepont Finch (played by senior drama major 
Skye Scott). Finch begins the show washing windows 
and reading Meads book. The narrator, voiced by Tony 
McKay (an associate professor in drama), tells him he 
can build his way up to running a large company.
Through the first act, Finch succeeds in becoming vice 
president of advertising for Wgrld Wide Widgets by
following the advice in his book, which, unfortunately, 
tells him in the second act that only a brilliant idea can 
save him. Finch now must rely on his own abilities to 
carry him onward in the company.
While he is building his career, Finch is supported by a 
secretary at the company  Rosemary (played by senior 
drama major Lora Lee Gayer)  who took a liking to 
him when he first bumped into company president J.B. 
Biggley (played by senior drama major Chase Newell).
Gayer, simply put, stole the show. This high-belting, 
extremely expressive actress drew eyes and ears to her 
every time she was on stage. A sharp twang to her voice 
brought to mind Broadway and television star Kristen 
Chenoweth, which was only supported by her comedic 
timing and charming carriage.
The minute details of the casting were on point for each 
character, from the threatening scratch Newell added 
in his voice to the perfect permanent scowl worn by 
senior drama major Tess Soltau in the role of Biggley's 
secretary, Miss Jones. Even the short stature of senior 
drama major Nick Cosgrove embodied the insignificant
pest that was his character, Bud Frump, the president's 
good-for-nothmg nephew.
In some songs  such as "Coffee Break  the 
choreographic timing, especially on moments intended 
to be synchronous, tended to falter; however, overall 
the dances only added to the adorableness of the show. 
For "The Company Way, Scott and senior drama major 
Ty Michael Robinson (as Twimble, the head of the 
mailroom) box-stepped on time and with gusto.
Director Daniel Goldstein truly took every advantage 
to play up the charm. Near the end of the first act, 
when Finch and Rosemary first kiss, lighting effects 
suggesting fireworks went up on the back of the stage. 
Some attempts were slightly over the top, such as the 
spotlight on Finch when he had a particularly successful 
moment, accompanied by brief chime from the pit; 
nevertheless, How to Succeed... never failed to win the 
hearts of its audience.

Rockettes put on spectacular show
Witness Christmas celebrations, from Santa to fairies to camels, at Benedum Center
This past weekends temperatures reached the 60s, but 
it was snowflakes and sparkles at the Benedum Center 
as The Radio City Christmas Spectacular opened for its 
two-month run. The Rockettes, in all of their kick-line 
glory, are performing in Pittsburgh until Dec. 6. The twohour-long show is a whirlwind of Christmas motifs: Santa 
arrives by sleigh but is upstaged by a sugarplum fairy 
bear, and Christmas shoppers  like models in a Gap 
commercial in bright scarves  hurry through New York  
City streets to find that last gift.
The Rockettes oldest and most famous routine is that 
of the wooden soldiers. Included in the Spectacular 
since 1933, it is a seven-minute test of the Rockettes 
uniformity. In high-waist, white sailor pants and red 
military jackets, the line moves about the stage creating 
star and circle patterns, culminating in a domino effect 
with each toy soldier falling down on the other.
break everything down. Go over every little step  its 
very tedious. We run things over and over again to get 
up our stamina, she said, explaining how the troupe 
perfects the uniform look for which it is famous.
Although most of the cast was trained in ballet, jazz, or 
tap, Larson-Hauk emphasized that the Rockette style is 
so much different than any other. Its its own beast  
its own style. Getting it into your body is difficult on top 
of trying to be in line, be on the right number. Then, of 
course, you have the directors and dance captains in the 
front," she said.-
Not only does a Rockette have to be a fully trained 
dancer, she must fit the look as well. Larson-Hauk is 
5'9" tall but says that dancers heights range between 
5'QVz" and 5'10y2", with shorter ladies at the end in order 
to create the optical illusion of a line of identical dancers.
an inaccuracy. The closing scene is that of the Nativity, 
with live-camels and farm animals accompanying the 
actors onstage, and although this is the most dazzling 
effect of the night, it is also the most out of place.
The first hour and 40 minutes of the show was an 
exaggerated spoof of the Christmas holiday  with 
"little people playing elves and actors, dressed in 
various animal costumes, reenacting a dance from The 
Nutcracker ballet  so the stark change to religious 
history is unsettling.
Nonetheless, for those who break out their Christmas 
decorations at Halloween and who are in contention 
with their Housefellow for permission to put up a 
personal dorm Christmas tree, this performance is not 
to be missed. For everyone else, take your children 
someday.
Christina Larson-Hauk, who has been with the Rockettes 
for 10 seasons, spoke about the rigor of the Rockette 
dance regimen. We rehearse for about three weeks 
before we open in Pittsburgh, six days a week for seven 
hours per day. We rehearse for a good portion of the 
morning, lunch break, and then the rest of the night. We
While for most of us, the Christmas season ends with the 
new year, Larson-Hauk attends charity functions and

honor to say Im a Radio City Rockette, she said.

Hidden treasures: DIY accesories and vintage boutiques
Homemade crafts make trendy additions to stylish wardrobe from resale, thrift stores

The '20s were defined by short cropped hair and fringeedged shifts while the power-obsessed 80s were more

Todays fashion world, however, does not have such de

as much hype as new clothes that have just made it off 
the drawing board and onto the racks.
DIY (no power drills needed)
Another rising theme in fashion is the age-old motto of 
handyman dads and neighbors: DIY, or do it yourself." 
Todays interpretation of DIY is a far cry from that of 
stubborn fathers and obnoxious neighbors armed with 
power tools; making your own jewelry, clothes, and ac
cessories can be a great outlet for creativity, a way to re
lax with friends, and a perfect way to obtain high fashion 
looks without dishing out large amounts of money. DIY 
is also one of the best ways for creating a unique look:
By making it yourself, you are ensuring that no one else 
will have it  unless a style spy is hiding in your closet 
as you break out your hot glue gun and sewing kit, but 
thats unlikely.
Headbands
Materials needed:
1 plain headband (preferably thick)
1 bag of mixed jewels, featheis, ribbon, or lace 
1 hot glue gun
First check that your closet is clear of spies. Then plug 
in your glue gun so that it warms up and plan out your 
headband.
Feathered and jeweled headbands have been every
where in magazines and stores, but its also possible to 
try out other ideas like wrapping a ribbon around the 
headband while leaving space between wraps so that 
both the color of the band as well as that of the ribbon 
are showing or by gluing small circles of pretty lace to 
the side of the band. By layering smaller circles of lace on 
top of larger ones, you can make the fabric look like little 
lace flowers.
One material that shouldnt be mixed with headbands is 
glitter  that is, unless you like having sparkles in your 
scalp all day.
For jewels and feathers, thick headbands are definitely 
better to use because you have a larger area to work 
with, and both of these materials stick to cloth head
bands better than plastic ones. With this in mind, youre 
free to feather and bejewel to create a unique headband.
Bib necklaces
There has to be a more flattering name for this acces
sory. However, in spite of its title, this necklace is really 
unique, stunning, and surpnsmgly easy to make.
Materials needed:
Cloth for the back of the necklace (mesh or felt are both 
preferable)
Bag of mixed jewels or beads 
1 thick, silky ribbon 
1 hot glue gun 
1 pair of scissors 
Needle and thread
First, cut the back" cloth into a pretty shape  this is 
like the base of the necklace, on which you will glue the 
jewels or beads, equivalent to the pendant part on a ba
sic necklace. Shapes like half-moons or those resembling 
shirt collars (bibs) work well with this style.
Then, use the hot glue gun and decorate the cloth 
however you want  some suggestions include lining 
the edges of the cloth with smaller beads and filling the 
middle with chunky gems.
Once the glue has dried and the gems are secure, cut 
the silky ribbon in half and sew the edges to either side 
of the cloth shape.
You can adjust the size of the ribbon to however long you 
want the necklace to hang  this look is usually best 
when it hangs just over your collar bone, so adjust it as 
needed. Fasten the necklace by tying the ribbon behind 
your neck.
Braided scarves
By braiding yarn or jersey fabric, you can put a new spin 
on the typical knitted scarf that your grandma loves to 
make so much.
Materials needed:
5 feet of fabric (jersey cotton or thick yarn)
1 hot glue gun
Scissors and a serrated knife
This DIY can by done in several ways. Feel free to experi
ment with the fabric choice  flowing mesh and other 
types work just as well as those suggested. You are free 
to buy fabric of the same color, or to pick three different 
colors.
Cut the fabric into thin strips, and separate it or the yam 
lengthwise into three sections. Tie the edges of these 
strips together so that they resemble three ponytails. 
Braid these strips together, and then tie the ends to
gether to create a braid of fabric. Wrap this around your 
neck to create a unique and gorgeous braided scarf. To 
create a less-finished look, use a serrated knife to rip the 
edges of the strips.
Create your own stylish feathered hair accessory by 
gluing feathers onto a hair clip.

Vintage and resale
Another way to create a unique and classic style is to 
take advantage of the many thrift, vintage, and resale 
stores in the area. Pittsburgh has an amazing offering 
of vintage and resale stores that vary in price, style, and 
theme  all of which offer unique and inspiring pieces 
to add to your wardrobe.
Avalon Exchange
5858 Forbes Ave. 412.421.2911
This shop is located in Squirrel Hill but has its roots 
in Oakland, where it was created in 1988 as a vintage 
clothing store. Today, its main focus is on the resale of 
contemporary pieces, but both old and new styles fill 
their shelves at very affordable prices. All kinds of fash
ion are sold here: shoes, coats, skirts, dresses, jewelry, 
and sunglasses. Apart from great pieces for everyday 
wear, Avalon Exchange also has amazing wigs and cos
tumes for Halloween, and in addition to selling clothes, 
the store is a place where you can sell your old ones, too.
Style is really what this stores all about," said Stuart 
McLane, the owner of the store. Good style seems to 
last forever, and its about the attitude just as much as 
the clothes."
A great place to find affordable fashion from both the 
past and the present, Avalon Exchange also has loca
tions in St. Louis, Mo. and Mt. Lebanon, Pa.
Hey Betty
5892 Ellsworth Ave. 412.363.0999
Located close to Walnut Street in Shadyside, this store 
has a great offering of genuine vintage clothing. Though 
the average price tag of this store is higher than Avalon 
Exchange, Hey Betty only sells genuine vintage pieces 
from the 1970s or older, so this is definitely a store for 
vintage lovers and those in search of statement pieces. 
Owned by Michael Ferrucci and Sandera Lawton, Hey
Eons Fashion Antique
5850 Ellsworth Ave. 412.361.3368
Just down the street from Hey Betty, Eons Fashion An
tique sells mainly vintage fashion, although there are a 
few more modern pieces available as well.
Yet another great place to find unique fashion, the store 
is also covered from floor to ceiling with everything from 
purses to pearls. Military and fur coats line the walls, and 
the racks are full of dresses from various eras. Stands of 
turquoise and silver jewelry, vintage sunglasses, scarves, 
and earrings are in abundance near the register; every
where you turn there are clothes and endless inspiration. 
Though slightly more expensive, Eons offers a great 
shopping environment and quality vintage clothing.
Betty has provided vintage dresses, coats, shoes, ac
cessories, and jewelry for 21 years. The shop is covered 
from floor to wall with pieces of the past  a fluffy white . 
crinoline hangs from the ceiling by the entrance, and 
jewelry covers the walls with silver, gold, and old gems.
According to Ferrucci, Hey Bettys focus is displaying 
the best of what we can find, and editing everything else 
out.
Offering everything from cowboy boots to vintage prom 
gowns, one of the special pieces found at Hey Betty is a 
black cocktail dress from the 1960s, which was owned 
by the first wife of Mel Torme of the Mel-Tones.
There is definitely a new appreciation for the unique
ness and timelessness of style in todays society. Fashion 
today can be seen as a mix of lessons learned in the past 
and the progress of the future, a mix of personal inter
pretations and inspiration drawn from others, constantly 
moving forward but always remembering where weve 
been. As legend Yves Saint Laurent once said, Fashion 
fades. Style is eternal.
Clockwise from left: Eons Fashion Antique is a great 
place to look for fashion finds. Eons offers up a 
wide selection of clothes and hats. Glittering beaded 
jewelry is on display at Eons for affordable prices.

Hemp, cotton, and bamboo: Eco-friendly fashion
These days, people are starting to become more 
and more aware of the environment. They try to buy 
products that are more environmentally friendly in 
every aspect, and fashion is no exception. Every 
year, eco-friendly materials appear on the runway; 
however, many people are not used to eco-fashion 
and are not really sure what it is. Here is a brief 
introduction to eco-fashion and some tips on how to 
translate eco-friendliness to your own wardrobe.
Eco-friendly clothes are made of raw organic 
materials that do not use pesticides. In addition, 
they do not involve the use of harmful chemicals 
or bleaches to color the fabric. These materials 
are often made from recycled and reused textiles. 
High-quality garments can be made from second
hand clothes and even recycled plastic bottles. 
Finally, eco-friendly clothes are made in a fair trade 
environment. People involved in the process of 
making these materials are treated and paid fairly.
Hemp
The textile with the highest potential for being 
eco-friendly is hemp. The ecological footprint of 
hemp is significantly smaller than any other fabric. 
Hemp plants grow quickly and densely, so it makes 
it difficult for weeds to interfere with the harvesting. 
The use of pesticides and other chemicals is also 
greatly reduced. In addition, hemp does not require 
much water, so no irrigation is needed. Hemp fibers 
are naturally long and require minimal spinning and 
processing work. Thus, hemp is very eco-friendly 
and long lasting. If you are interested in hemp 
clothing, try www.hempest.com. The site offers 
organic hemp clothing, accessories, gear, paper, 
food, and body care products. They have anything 
you can imagine in hemp.
Organic cotton
. .' ~ . ''O' ' ,
More farmers are getting involved with organic 
cotton  the process of growing cotton in which, 
during the growing cycles, farmers do not use 
pesticides, herbicides, or insecticides. Moreover, in 
the process of manufacturing clothes from organic 
cotton, producers use natural dyes to reduce the 
amount of artificial chemicals. In recent years, new 
cotton growing techniques have emerged that grow 
colored cotton. The process naturally grows cotton 
in shades of blue, green, and other colors. In fact, the 
color of the cotton gets more vibrant as the clothes 
are washed. Loomstate (Loomstate.org), a clothing 
brand based in New York City, uses 100 percent 
certified organic cotton from various regions of the 
world such as Turkey, Peru, Africa, India, and the 
United States in all their clothes. They were also 
featured at Barneys New York.
Soy silk
Frances Soong | Art Staff
Soy silk is a byproduct from making tofu. The 
liquefied proteins are extruded into fibers that are 
then spun and used like any other fiber. It is easy to 
purchase this silk yarn and make your own scarves 
or sweaters. Try www.soysilk.com to order some.
The high protein content makes it easier to dye 
colors, so you can even create your own color.
Bamboo
It may be surprising, but bamboo is actually highly 
renewable grass. Because it is highly renewable, 
it is classified as eco-friendly. Bamboo grass also 
has natural antibacterial properties so it is easily 
biodegradable. If you want to see what kind of 
clothing can be made out of bamboo grass, check 
out www.organicbambooclothing.com. They offer a 
, variety of clothing made from bamboo.
Wool
Wool can be an eco-friendly material as long as 
conscious effort is made in processing. With high 
emphasis on productivity and speed, wool is 
produced from factory-farmed sheep. These sheep 
live miserable lives and their handlers do not care 
for the condition of these sheep. It is common to cut 
off a sheeps nose in the shearing process. With a 
responsible, eco-friendly manufacturer, most of these 
issues can be alleviated and truly eco-friendly wool 
can be produced.

You will meet your end when you choke to death during an 
attempt to prove your manliness (or womanhood) by eating 
15 entire burritos in one sitting.
You will die a traumatic death involving spider monkeys, 
potato chips, and celery in a scene too gruesome to describe 
in print.
Your unfortunate death at the hands of an amateur stage 
magician (he forgot to use the trick swords), will not go 
completely unnoticed, as the entire audience runs screaming 
from the theater.
Starvation deaths work in a funny way. That is, you dont 
actually die until you realize you should be dead. Thus, I can 
honestly say that you abruptly starve to death.
Your proclivity for getting overwhelmed with work takes a 
bad turn when you take on a job re-sorting the entirety of 
the Library of Congress. You are killed by a falling stack of 
Thomas Jefferson biographies.
Your death, though entirely accidental, hilariously involves a 
pickax, a set of crampons, and a posthumous Nobel Prize.
Records show that all Libras died sometime in the past 
month of a relatively rare and easily preventable infection. 
Interesting coincidence.
Your death, though otherwise uneventful, is marked by your 
choice of final game with death. Monsters and Mortuaries, a 
six-hour-minimum game with 15 rulebooks, does not sit well 
with the Angel of Death.
Though ballooning certainly is a fun and noble pastime, 
proper equipment is crucial. Ten thousand helium balloons 
strapped to a lawn chair is not proper equipment. Also, the 
stratosphere is much colder than you thought it would be.
Though highly improbable, even the best doctors are 
speechless and helpless when all of your internal organs 
suddenly transform into delicious chocolate chip cookie 
dough.
Remember that whole thing about Pop Rocks and soda? You 
will discover that, though very fun for the first few minutes, 
the reaction has drastic implications for the structural integrity 
of your stomach.
Desperation can lead to bad decisions, but that still doesn't 
justify eating something called Take Seven Steps and Die 
poison.

Kappa Alpha Theta hosted Mr. Fraternity, an annual charity event last 
Friday. Participants from campus fraternities strutted their stuff as they 
catwalked down a ramp during the toga, swimwear, and formal wear 
rounds of the contest. Junior mechanical engineering major and Sigma 
Phi Epsilon brother Charles Rawlins was crowned Mr. Fraternity at the 
event.
