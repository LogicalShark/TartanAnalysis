Carnegie Institute 
Head Dies At 82
Last week Carnegie Tech was 
grieved by the news that Samuel 
Harden Church, famous industrial
ist and scholar, had died. Mr. 
Church, who was president of Car
negie Institute and chairman of the 
Board of Trustees of Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology, received nation
wide attention when, in 1940, he of
fered a reward of a million dollars 
to the person who would delived 
Adolph Hitel alive, unwounded, 
and unhurt to the League of Na
tions, within one month.
Mr. Churchs career is another 
Horatio Alger story. Starting out 
by working as a cash boy in Joseph 
Horne Co. for $1.50 a week ,he had 
by 1928 retired from the Pennsyl
vania Railroad Company with the 
rank of vice-president.
In 1895, when Andrew Carnegie 
was starting on one of his philan
thropic enterprises, he appointed 
Mr. Church one of his trustees. Mr. 
Church acted as secretary of the 
Carnegie Institute until 1914 when 
he was elected president.
Ever taking an active part in na
tional affairs, Mr. Church had 
spoken for the Republican party on 
many occasions, and in 1904 he was 
a delegate to the Republican nation
al convention. Mr. Church had al
ways been an advocate of world 
peace and has written many articles 
for leading newspapers and mag
azines.
During World War I when King 
Albert of Belgium visited Pitts
burgh, he personally presented Mr. 
Church with the decoration of Com
mander of the crown of Belgium for 
his fine work in gathering American 
sympathy for the Belgian cause. 
Mr. Church also was decorated by 
the French government, but in June 
1941 he returned his Legion of Hon
or award to the Vichy government 
with the words that honor is dead 
in a country wfiich abjectly bows to 
Hitlers wishes.
During his long career, Mr. 
Church wrote many books and had 
conferred upon him rriany honorary 
degrees.

Col. Frank Pirkey 
New Commandant
We are proud to present to you 
Colonel Frank Z. Pirkey, the new 
commandant of the ASTP and 
ROTC units of Carnegie Tech.
Many of you know  the Colonel 
already, for in the week he has been 
here he has gone all around the 
campus trying to become acquaint
ed with Tech, its students and its 
faculty. It is easy to recognize him
- -the Colonel is tall, pleasant and 
for his high rank very young look
ing. But for the eagles on his 
shoulders and his air of authority 
one might mistake him for a new
ly commissioned lieutenant.
Colonel Pirkey came to West 
Point from his native California 
some twenty-five years ago, and 
graduated from the Academy in 
1921 as an officer in the Corps of 
Engineers.
During the last twenty years the 
Colonel has seen active duty almost 
everywhere in the United States as 
well as in Hawaii and in PuertoRico. He advanced rapidly, and in 
1941 became a regimental com
mander in our West-Indian terri
tory. Before coming to Tech, 
Colonel Pirkey served for a few 
months at Fort Belvoir in Kentucky.
Our commandant looks forward 
to a pleasant, though difficult and 
exacting job. He likes the school, 
and is full of praise for the high de
gree of cooperation he found among 
faculty and students alike. Of course 
he is fully aware of the impending 
problems, and he realizes that the 
relations between army and civil
ian students can be improved con
siderably. However, with the pros
pect of a canteen and a few other 
projects that will bridge the gap, 
he is confident that complete amity 
will soon be established, and he 
pledges the full support of the mil
itary authorities.
AST-Civilian Canteen 
Now Planned For Hut
The long-awaited PX for the sol
diers has been combined with a 
canteen to be set up in the Hut 
which will be open to both military 
personnel and civilians alike. Plans 
are not yet complete in regard to its 
exact nature but it is expected that 
the canteen will provide a meetingplace for the students and fill the 
gap which has existed in campus 
facilities.
The books in the Hut will be di
vided between Margaret Morrison 
and Industries, the Margaret Mor
rison section consisting only of those 
books which are most used by the 
students in that college. The re
mainder of the books will be placed 
in room 240, the present location of 
the Military Department cadre. The 
men in room 240 will move to some 
other room in Industries, probably 
room 335. Definite announcements 
of the hours and other particulars 
have not been made, but the situa
tion should have crystalized by next 
week.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1943
fsditot. A>UHchafo
Despite the fact that the dance last Saturday night was allegedly an 
all-campus affair, it had a decided leaning to the militaristic atmosphere, 
as have all the mixed soldier-civilian affairs. It seems that the civilian male 
population at Tech is afraid to come to any affair where he is likely to run 
up against military competition.
However, the civilians who do try to attend these social gatherings have 
found quite the opposite to be the case. The girls are naturally attracted 
to a man in uniform because in these days they feel it is their patriotic 
duty to entertain the men who are going, eventually, to fight in the front 
lines. But only a -few man-hunters actually exist; most of the girls are 
just as happy to dance with a civilian as with a soldier. The trouble now 
seems to be that girls come to dances and are left en masse like a bunch of 
wallflowers for the lack of men to dance with. The thing for the civilians 
to do is attend these dances and see for themselves just what conditions 
are. The soldiers we have talked to have expressed their desires for civilian 
attendance at the mixed dances. So come on, civilians, lets see you turn 
out for the next soldier-civilian dance!
Apology
The repercussions from last weeks editorial by our regular editor have 
been quite heavy, and we feel that an apology is in order. The information 
reaching our editor was grossly misrepresented, and conveyed the wrong 
impression. We engineers, who have been in better contact with the re
turned ROTC know that, on the whole, there is no harsh feeling between 
the two groups. Reports of such feeling spring, probably, from a couple 
of the malcontents who always manage to associate themselves with any 
group.
On our part, we wish to express our deepest apologies for the im
pression given by last weeks editorial and we would like to express our 
hope that nothing will come of this beyond criticism of this newspaper 
for printing the article.
Acting Editor.
one of the profs
Hearsay from the editor
In case some of the seniors have 
lost count, there are sixty-one days 
left.
Amazing circumstance: It looked 
as though nearly everyone from 
Dear Old Tech had turned out for 
the pep rally on Friday night. Come 
Saturday, and! Where is the spirit 
that sent nearly all Tech to cheer 
our team through rain and foul 
weather while it held Notre Dame 
16-0! Or did that kind of spirit pass 
out with the mens dorms?* * *
Both soldiers and civilians should 
welcome the new canteen being set 
up for the benefit of all Techites 
in the Hut. For those living on or 
around campus, it will provide a 
nice place to get cokes and incident
als at decent prices. We dont know
exactly what plans are, but we 
might suggest that they sell sta
tionary and gym suits as well as 
other things.
Now to cap the climax: The art 
exhibit is ^a marvelous thing. If 
any of you want to see some real 
works of skill and brush from the 
old school, just look for some of the 
unmentionables. We are not art 
critics, but it would be a fool indeed 
who could not tell applied skill, pa
tience, and inborn sense of balance 
when viewing some of the better 
paintings as compared to the prize 
winners. We would like to have 
someone from the P.&D. Depart
ment just tell just what a modern 
art critic goes for so we can blob 
up a canvass in our undelicate way 
and walk off with a prize with our 
slap-happy rendering.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

According to traditional college 
stories, when the student body hears 
that a teacher is leaving the campus, 
' their remarks are Thank good
ness! or Its about time! But 
when Carnegie Tech students were 
told of Prof. M. Leo Carrolls de
parture, there were many reluctant 
goodbyes and even a few tears 
from the soft hearted females.
But the tears and farewells were 
sincere  not just put on to make 
Mr. Carroll feel good, for he was 
really one of the boys. In the days 
of Skibo, it was not unusual to see 
him in that coke-and-bridge hang
out drinking coke and mixing with 
the students. Recently he ate lunch 
in the grill with several South 
American students, both because he 
liked to speak Spanish with them 
and because he was a students 
friend.
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, he 
attended Harvard College where he 
majored in Romance languages with 
emphasis on Spanish and French. 
After his graduation in 1924, .he 
went into business for a year be
cause, as he so aptly puts it, he was 
fed up with too much grind on the 
books. While at Harvard he had 
his own dance band which helped to 
pay his way through school. He also 
was a member of the famous Har
vard Glee Club, whose director is 
Archibald Davidson. He became in
terested in folk songs, particularly 
French, Spanish, and Italian. An
other of his interests was drama.
While in Pittsburgh, he was a 
member of the Stage and Play So
ciety where he appeared in several 
plays under the direction of Chester 
Wallace who was then the head of 
the Carnegie Tech drama depart
ment. During the years between 
1932 and 1938 he played the lead in 
the annual three-act plays given by 
the language department which 
were directed by Prof. Parisi.
Mr. Carrolls teaching career start
ed after his year in the business 
world when he became homesick 
for languages. He accepted a posi
tion at the University of Michigan 
and while he taught there, he pre
pared for his doctors degree. He
. . . M. Leo Carrol
never received it, howver, for in 
the midst of his study he received 
an offer from Carnegie Tech.
He arrived at Carnegie in the fall 
of 1927 and taught French exclusive
ly until recent years when Spanish 
became vogue and he included that 
language in his teaching program.
In spite of his work at Carnegie, 
Mr. Carroll found time for outside 
affiliations. He became active in 
Alliance Franaise and Foyer Fran
aise, two Pittsburgh French organ
izations, the Harvard Club of West
ern Pennsylvania, and served as an 
honorary member of the Pittsburgh 
Junior Chamber of Commerce. He 
was also the faculty advisor of the 
Rho chapter of Phi Kappa here at 
Carnegie.
The Phi Kaps, as well as other 
fraternities may remember Mr. Car
roll for the entertaining moments 
which he created by playing fourhanded duets with his wife, who is 
an accomplished pianist.
Leaving Tech after 16 years, I 
know Im goings to miss all my cam
pus friends terribly and I think Tech 
students are the salt of the earth, 
said Mr. Carroll. He added, with a 
gleam in his eye, When I come 
back I hope to see Tech with a real
ly, sharp football team!
Mr. Carroll is leaving Carnegie 
Tech to accept a position with the 
United States government in Wash
ington where he will be working 
with languages.
In appearance, Mr. Carroll looks 
like an answer to Coach Skladanys 
request for football players, for he 
is a large man, standing over six 
feet tall. In fact, he actually looks 
like a tough guy but when one 
gets to know him, hes very friendly 
and amiable.
We speak for all the students at 
Carnegie Tech, Mr. Carroll, when 
we say that we will miss you more 
than you can ever miss us.
According to the way you taught 
us, let us say Hasta La Vista, Au 
Revoir, and Bonne Chance which in 
plain English means Goodbye and 
Good Luck. Youre a swell prof and 
a sweller guy!

TUESDAY, OCTOBEK 19, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
one of the boys
The returning ROTC boys 
brought with them several former 
BMOCs, including Bob Galbraith, 
former Student Council President. 
Bob, with four other Carnegie Tech 
boys, spent the summer at Camp 
Abbott, Oregon a beautiful place, 
right in the middle of the moun
tains, but that doesnt matter. One 
went to West Point; the others are 
back. Bob will take up his studies 
as a Mechanical General in the 
special classes set up for returning 
Mechanicals and Electricals.
Bobs views on coming back to 
Carnegie are entirely standard, 
Good to be back to school and see 
familiar faces. People are warmer 
now than when we went away. He 
notices some changes around cam
pus though. Its funny to see 
everyone marching to class. I miss 
the Beanery and Skibo, but then, 
theres no free time anyway. Looks 
as though the fraternities are rath
er dormant. The boys have been 
told that they are here waiting for 
openings in officer candidate schools, 
which means that none of them 
knows when he will be leaving. At 
least thats one thing they share 
with the civilian men.
In agreement with the opinion of 
many students are Bobs views on
. . . Bob Galbraith
civilian-Army relations. As he sees 
it, when the civilians outnumbered 
the Army they tended to let the 
ASTP go its own way, and when 
the Army became a dominant force 
on campus it was too late, and the 
civilians gave up. The main ob
stacle to better understanding now 
is the factions in both the civilian 
and Army bodies that oppose any 
attempt to bring the two groups to
gether. The ROTC boys dont have 
much trouble, however, he says, 
Because they know people on the 
campus.
Bob cant see much chance for the 
fellows who came back to get into 
school activities because of the lim
ited free time. Theres always an 
assembly to go to here or something 
else there. When asked for some 
information for the TARTAN, he 
answered, Thats funny, but might 
as well be humorous.
In addition to his work on Stu
dent Council, Bob was a member of
O. D. K., Scabbard and Blade, the 
swimming team, and unofficial head 
of the Theta Xi bull session squad. 
He came originally from Tulsa, Ok
lahoma, choosing Tech because he 
wanted to go to a good engineering 
school.
Kiltie Band Success 
At Tech-Leliigh Game
Giving striking evidence of the 
times with the unprecedented addi
tion of three girls and 35 ASTP 
men to its roster of 40 civilian stu
dents, the Kiltie band made its first 
appearance this semester at the Le
high game on Saturday. And what 
a sensational opening. The^ mem
bers of the band are really to be con
gratulated for their fine playing 
and all Tech is mighty proud of 
them.
With Robert Davis as Drum Ma
jor, the band is under the direction 
of Mr. James Morrow. Though Sat
urday was only its initial appear
ance, Robert Altman, manager of 
the Kilties, announced that the band 
now has high hopes of appearing at 
many of the forthcoming school 
functions.
It is hoped that the Kiltie Band 
will make an appearance at the 
Carnegie-West Virginia game to be 
held next week at Morgantown,

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1943
Hundred Tliirty-five 
Volunteers Signetl For 
Tech Blood Bank Day
Last winter the Red Cross Mo
bile Unit was set up in Rec Hall 
and met with encouraging response. 
This year, however, the Red Cross 
has advised us that the Mobile Unit 
is urgently needed in outlying dis
tricts. We students can do our part 
by going downtown to the main 
Blood Bank in the Wabash Build
ing.
Encouraging response to the first 
Carnegie Day led 'the committee to 
plan a series of similar days 
throughout this year. So far the re
sponse has been good. One hundred 
thirty-five volunteers have signed 
for Saturday, October 23. To ac
commodate those for whom Satur
day appointments are inconvenient, 
plans are being made to get 10 vol
unteers for each day from Monday 
through Friday at any time between 
9:45 a. m. and 8:00 p. m., leading up 
to another Carnegie Day on Novem
ber 20 with an expected 100 volun
teers.
Registrations as blood donors will 
be taken every Tuesday throughout 
the year at both the entrance to Ad
ministration Hall and the entrance 
to Maggie Murph; registration 
hours are 11 to 2.
On The Record
The following programs have 
been chosen for the record recitals

Colonel Samuel Harden Church 
was one of Pittsburghs best-known 
citizens and one of her most dis
tinguished leaders. As president of 
the Carnegie Institute he contribut
ed significantly to the civic and cul
tural life of this community 
throughout a long period, and his 
notable services in many fields won 
for him national and world recogni
tion. Colonel Church had a long 
career as an official of the Pennsyl

Last week, young Americans 
from every state in the union and 
from Alaska and Haiti stood in long 
imes on the parking ramps of 
eleven advanced flying schools in 
the great Southwest to receive their 
silver pilots wings. The occasion 
was graduation of the Army Air 
Forces Central Flying Training 
Command.
Precision-trained in modern air 
combat, the bronzed and husky 
flyers need but brief transitional 
schooling before taking their places 
in the fighting armadas already 
blasting at the Axis on the globestraddling fronts. The graduating 
classes included, to a greater extent 
than ever before, a substantial per
centage of commissioned officers 
who had left tactical and adminis
trative assignments to receive flight 
training.
Central Flying Training Com

Gehron, from Williamsport, Pa and 
Ellington field, Lt. Victor R. Kregel, 
of Irwin, Pa. and Blackland field, Lt. 
Lt. Paul S. Warren from Riverside, 
Illinois and Eagle Pass field, and 
Lt. Arthur T. Tuthill, from Cutchogue, N. Y. and Foster field.
From Oklahoma City Air Depot 
at Tinker Field, Okla., come news 
of the promotion of Second Lt. 
Elmer L. McCall to the rank of 
First Lt. He is assigned to a depot

Langs Tests Positive; 
Skibo Springs Pure
There is one very famous land
mark on the campus of which most 
Techites are unconscious. Beside the 
old Skibo Inn, which now serves as 
a barber shop for the ASTP, there is 
a fountain which constantly keeps 
flowing. There is no magic about it, 
but actually the water comes from 
an underground spring whose 
source is somewhere high in Squir
rel Hill. The spring runs down 
through Schenley Park and the golf 
course, finally coming out in front 
of Skibo.
Behind this little spring stands a 
group of odd experiences. About 
thirty years ago, the school was very 
interested in finding out if the waiter 
was polluted. A city company con
ducted a series of tests with the con
clusion that the water was contam
inated. However, a short time after
ward, Professor Lang who teaches 
biology at Margaret Morrison, also 
held some tests which proved that 
the spring water wasnt polluted. 
Consequently, the school left the 
spring open, and students occasion
ally drank this water which doesnt 
contain the typically bad taste of 
regular Pittsburgh water.
Every year Professor Lang gave 
his biology students samples of the 
water to test, and one year the 
water did prove to be contaminated. 
Hence, Carnegie Tech finally decid
ed to close the spring.
Years went by, and the ownership 
of Skibo Inn again changed hands. 
The new owner, finding a nice fresh 
spring, decided to open it up. Pro
fessor Lang made another test of th'e 
water, and since he concluded that 
it was safe to drink, it has been kept 
open.
Every so often during the week, 
if you are careful to notice, a zootlooking car rolls up in front of 
Skibo. The chauffeur steps out and 
proceeds to fill up about five onegallon jugs with the spring water. 
Now if you pass by Skibo and youre 
thirsty, take a drink. You might 
swallow an amoeba or two, but 
youll never notice it.
Ah! Sweet Misery, Etc.
The Tartan team got in and fought 
Through mud and wind and rain, 
They stopped the ball at the very 
goal,
But Lehigh did the same.
Refreshment vendors gave up hope, 
Of ever making a sale,
The boys on the field looked up at 
the rain 
And feared itd turn to hail.
The stands were really empty,
Our spirits were running low,
But we knew wed seen a football 
game
When we got up to go.
All this and a good many other 
verses also are the collective opinion 
and viewpoint of a rank amateur 
a freshman, no doubt. At any rate, 
we are happy to print anyones re
actions to the game we play, we 
being a liberal newspaper staff.
Life is beginning to get tough! 
We just cant take the cold weather 
anymore  at least we couldnt that

know, every day in Pittsburgh is a 
dirt filled day but thats not the kind 
of dirt we gather.)

Comrade X Reports 
From Sports Heaven
By Walt Darby, Acting Editor
Well, this is the experience of a 
lifetime! Did you ever, while view
ing an exciting game of football 
from behind a curtain of cold, chisel
ing rain, look up at the nice, cozy 
press box and wish the whole sta
dium was built in like that and 
heated? Well, stop wishing, because 
those places are sclusive and be
sides that, whats football without 
a cold the next morning?
Yours truly has sat through rain, 
hail, sleet, snow, cold and hot, cloud 
and sun to see his dear old team 
go on to victory, ignominious or 
glorious defeat, but last Saturday 
he got a terrific opportunity to view 
a game from a different attitude  
the attitude of the much-envied 
press box.
It happened like this: the subject 
of this discussion walked to the 
game through the gathering cold, 
and watched the sun almost put in 
an appearance. This made him very 
happy because he still believed him
self destined to watch from the 
stands like any other student from 
the Land of the Cameron Plaid. But 
his mind was drastically changed 
the minute he attempted to enter 
the gate. One of the men inspecting 
registration cards there was an old 
pal from the TARTAN of the old 
days, and he jokingly suggested that 
yours was going into the pressbox 
(maybe?). Mr. Moses was punching 
the tickets, and he did not know 
that this minute suggestion caused 
a change of heart in the gray matter 
of Comrade X, so he quietly punch
ed the registration card. Mr. Nemo, 
always willing to carry a joke to the 
extreme, jokingly asked if it would 
be possible to go on with the joking 
suggestion and enter to the box of 
the fourth estate, high up in the 
stadium and closed in. Mr. Moses, 
observing that Scotty was a member 
of the TARTAN staff, said sure, but 
continued on page 7
At the dance we saw Dan Schocter showing his Winchester-Thurston partner, Elaine Frankel how 
Tech does things . . . Ditto Ted 
Gazda and Bob Charpie, Delts, 
whose dates were from their homeOhio, respectively . . . Tom Bokman must have feared someone 
would steal pretty Jo Sunseri, Kap
pa pledge, away from him, judging 
from the way he held on to her all 
evening . . . Naval Aviation Cadet 
Ash Etkes came in on a 24-hour pass 
to escort blonde Lois Frishkorn . . . 
Nick Yaru forsook Eric, the D.U. 
Great Dane, Saturday night to take 
a date to the dance . . . Dr. and 
Mrs. Chapman really cutting a rug 
to a fast jump tune . . . Isa Lazaer 
and Tau Delt pledge Eph Abramson 
... Merle Wolff and Betty Ayers, 
a non-Techite . . . Sam Duff and 
Pete Cook . . . Aldies Hugh
Smith and Martha Sekey, Bill Wolf 
and Shirley Swaney, Ruth Beall and

Pvt. Jim Balmer and 2nd Lt. Fritz 
Morgan . . . Mike Gingold, but we 
couldn't decide whether his date 
was with a blonde or a camera . . . 
Johnny Lindberg escorted his cane 
and Janet Armstrong . . . Beta Sig 
Bob Marcus and Maggie Murph 
freshie Jolene Svirman . . . Irv 
Aisenberg showed up in spite of a 
broken arm sustained in the Tau 
Delt-Beta Sig game last week . . . 
The orchestra helped Techites cele
brate Bob Davis birthday ... A 
highlight of the evening came when 
the orchestra played Pistol Packin 
Mama and held out the micro
phone to various students to allow 
them to show the world what radio 
had missed. When the crowd swung 
out on the chorus they probably 
shook the hotel guests out of bed 
. . . Several mainstays of our foot
ball team were seen at Joe Mazers 
after the dance rehashing the after
noon game.
We hear that Ted Drabers, Delt, 
caused Eleanor Wilsons heart to 
flutter an extra flutter when he gave 
her his fraternity pin last week.
Marine Lieutenant Len Chotiner, 
editor of the TARTAN last year, 
returned to the campus to visit his 
old haunts last week while on a 
15-day leave. We shudder to think 
of his reaction on finding his child, 
the TARTAN, nursed and put to bed 
in the cold Pattern Making Room 
in Industries Hall instead of in the 
luxurious suite in the Union.
Large Charge Jane Branagan 
spent her time at the dance with her 
Southn smoothie, Jim, of Company
D.
If we were asked to vote for the 
AST soldier who knew most Tech 
girls, we would write the name 
George Reynolds on our ballot. That 
guy sure gets around!
We feel the cold germ (we call 
him Chum because hes become an 
intimate friend of ours) getting 
ready for another attack so we must 
put aside our little shovel and take 
out the cold preventative pills (sold 
in the doctors officeplug) and 
sulphur and molasses and Rem and 
every other medicine we have ac
cumulated on our bed table. We 
simply must be out in time for 
Junior Prom, which, incidentally, 
comes off on November 13th.
So from our ' towns, Sharon, Pa., and Cleveland,

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1943
A Tech back takes the ball as the strong Lehigh line surges in. But 
good blocking by Tech guards netted our runner a gain in this play.
* * * * *
Tartans Fumble First Chance 
Tie With Brown and White 0-0
Co. B Football Race Tightens 
B 21 Overthrows B 12, 19-6
Two determined teams slid, fum
bled, and crawled to a scoreless 
deadlock Saturday as Lehighs un
tried eleven met our victory-hungry 
squad.
For a change, Tech was the favor
ite. This choice was based largely 
on two facts. First, Techs squad 
had two tough games behind them 
while the Lehigh boys were untest
ed; and second, both are army 
schools, consequently, neither has 
much material. However, no one 
actually knew just what Lehigh had, 
and the experts  judgment was 
not altogether sound. As it turned 
out, Lehigh had something of a star 
in Majczen, a light but fast and shif
ty back. More than once, Mr. Majc
zen left Techs would-be tacklers 
with their noses deep in the muddy 
field. Techs tackling was poor, es
pecially in the open. Littons effi
cient punting was partially nullified 
by runbacks which might by some 
be called spectacular, but were due 
more than anything else to the fail
ure of the tartans to connect with 
their tackles. Many Lehigh gains 
could have been nipped in the bud 
if only one of the many hurtling 
bodies had hit its target. Many 
strangle-hold tackles resulted in a 
couple of extra yards before the 
runner was finally thrown.
Our pass defense, it seems, will 
never click. Fortunately, the ball 
was wet and Lehigh receivers were 
butterfingered. Of the many incom
plete Lehigh passes, more were 
muffed than were broken up. But 
this same wet ball worked against 
us when Les Wahrenberg barely 
missed an interception while an 
open field beckoned him to pay dirt.
The game produced nothing spec
tacular. Neither team had a power
ful offense and neither had much of 
a defense. Ground gains were short. 
Lehighs passes were good, but re
ceivers threw away many a scor
ing opportunity. Techs passes were 
bad and the receiverswell, they 
could never get near the ball, let 
alone attempt to catch it.
Late in the third quarter, the 
Skibomen were well within striking 
distance of a score, but passed it up.
A Lehigh punt was downed on the
Tartans 26-yard line. Dunn picked 
up three yards. Vokel smashed 
through to the 33 and then went on 
for a first down. Vockel and Dunn 
each lost a yard and Litton punted 
to the Lehigh 39. Lehigh picked up 
7 yards on the first play, fumbled on 
the next, McAninch recovered for 
Tech on the Lehigh 38. McIntosh 
broke loose to the 30 as the quarter 
ended.
On the first play of the final quar
ter, McIntosh drove 4 more yards 
for a first down. McIntosh faked a 
pass and turned the right end for 6 
yards. This made it 2nd and 4 to 
go on the Lehigh 20. Ground gain
ing had been substantial, but of five 
passes attempted up to this point, 
none had been completed. Never
theless, Tech passed three in succes
sion  all incomplete  and the last 
scoring opportunity of the game 
soared out of reach.
At the end of the third quarter a 
familiar figure darkened the side
lines. Immediately cries of We 
want Al! went up from the postage 
stamp crowd. After a little coaxing, 
off came the topcoat and suitcoat 
and a booming voice issued forth 
from the sturdy little man. Are 
you ready? Lets go! As we 
launched into The Institute, we 
wondered if weather conditions 
might not alter Als technique. The 
big moment approached, and the 
crowd grew tense. Then it came  
the last Rah  and Al somersault
ed in the muddy track. Hats off to 
Al and to the little band of Techites 
who braved the driving rain to see 
their boys in the first home game of 
the season. Also, we wont forget 
the appearance of our cheer leaders. 
Theyre not bad (as cheerleaders, 
of course) and if the crowd had 
known the cheers, the yells might 
have been very impressive. The 
Kiltie Band showed up in all  its 
skirted glory, and, though dismissed 
before the half, looked very sharp 
in its pre-game antics. The loyal 
dancers pepped up the spirit with 
their traditional dance, kick, or 
whatever one chooses to call it, and 
the other Kilties who remained af
ter dismissal kept us warm with a 
little jam session.
With three games left to play, 
the Intra-sectional race resolved 
itself into a mad scramble for the 
top positions. The league leaders 
seem assured of ending in their pres
ent order, but the fifth to ninth po
sitions may see some changes by 
October 21st, when the 72 game 
schedule will come to an end.
In the first games of the week B12 
scored an easy victory over a passdefenseless B41 squad. The end of 
the 32 playing minutes marked the 
12-0 victory for the first platoon 
team. The other game of the day 
had B22 battle B51. The missing 
spaifc plug, Matt Maley, counted 
heavily as the 22 team beat the tired 
warriors by one touchdown. Price 
Harrison scored the victory as the 
B22 team picked up the greatly 
needed percentage points to show a 
.250 mark.
Thursday, October 14th, saw a 
battle royale. The elimination of 
the B12 squad by B21, and the in
tense rivalry between the first and 
second platoons promised a good 
game for the 12-21 contest. The rain 
plus the condition of the alreadysoaked field made a prediction im
possible as both teams took the 
field. B12 was out for blood and 
proved it in the first few minutes 
of play. They completely dominated 
the first quarter. There was no 
score, however, as the 2nd team 
tightened each time to withstand the 
scoring attack. The half ended with 
the 22 men slipping and sliding on 
a mud covered field. In the first 
few minutes of the half Billy DeVos 
intercepted a 12 pass deep in his 
own territory. He put on a beauti
ful running exhibition as he picked 
up interference and ran 70 yards 
through both teams for a touch
down. The attempt to convert failed 
and the score stood 6-0. There was 
some argument as to 12s tagging 
the runner, but Head Ref DeHaan 
upheld the play.
On the kickoff to B12, Little Ed 
Selke evened matters by picking up 
the kick and running it the length 
of the field to even the score. The 
try for the extra point failed and 
the teams stood at 6-6. On the kickback Anderson imitated the DeVos, 
Selke act with a terrific 90-yard run 
through the 12 line. The last at
tempt to catch the flying Kentuckian 
failed as the 12 man made a flying 
leap for Ambitious Andy. The point 
after touchdown was scored by a 
pass from Joyce to Anderson, and 
the score moved to 13-6. On the 
kick-off 12 took the ball and moved 
it down the field on successive plays. 
First Kennedy and the Selke tried 
the ends; making two first downs 
before the 21 line stiffened. Joyces 
men took the ball after 12 failed to 
make the required distance in four 
downs and the ball started back 
down the field. A pass to Hill, an 
end run by Joyce, and short bullet 
pass to Anderson netted the 2nd 
squad twenty yards. The third at
tempt for a first down failed and the 
first took the ball again. The rain 
must have affected the play, because 
on the snap-back form center Selke 
fumbled the ball and recovered at
the expense of ten yards. The next 
play saw Kerr intercept a pass 
bound for Humphreyville and the 
2nd squad took up the march again. 
A long pass by Joyce had Hal Birkenstock jump above a mixed group 
of 12 and 21 men to catch the ball 
and fall over the goal line for an
other six points. The score moved 
to 19-6 as the 2nd failed to convert. 
On the play Birgenstock was knock
ed out of the game and Dusek sub
stituted. Kid Birkenstock played a 
"fine game and had he been knocked 
out earlier the score might have 
been different.
B12 took the ball on the kick-off 
and tried to score thirteen points in 
two minutes. Kennedys time out 
cry helped give the 1st a chance at 
the poto gold, but despite the 
hard and fast playing of the 12 men, 
the game ended in a B21 victory. 
Final score 19-6.
With three games left on the In
tra-Mural schedule; first place is 
still a toss-up among B21 and B31. 
Second place is cinched by the 12 
eleven and unless 11 ties with 32 or 
22, the first four teams seem to be 
in. In either event the top four 
will play off to pick two teams to 
play the Civvie Shamps some eight 
man games before furlough time.

he didnt know how to get there. 
But Mr. Brain got a press box ticket 
straight from Mr. Moses pocket, byMr. Moses own hands, and went 
aloft to observe the game in the 
name of THE CARNEGIE TARTAN.
Z-29 eventually found the way 
into the press box and sat down in 
his front-row seat among all the 
newspaper correspondents. The 
huge windows in the front of the 
box were open, and the dreary field 
presented itself in the close pan
orama below. The Kiltie Band 
bounced down the soggy field with 
a little of the usual spring gone 
from their by-now-frozen limbs to 
the familiar strains of Dear Old 
Tech, stopped in the middle of the 
field and played The Star Spangled 
Banner, and was seated.
Ace was ready for the game by 
this time, having borrowed a pencil 
from somebody else (not having ex
pected this opportunity, he had not 
brought his own) and dragged some 
scratch paper out of his raincoat 
pocket. Lehigh kicked to Tech, and 
yours, copying the manner of the 
sports writer to his left, began tak
ing notes on every play that hap
pened. Then he discovered that the 
guy with the field glasses was a 
scout, who naturally observed every 
play and the intricacies of the vari
ous plays and such stuff. In other 
words, he was doing about five times 
as much work as a sports writer, 
and therefore yours of the untrained 
school of sportsmen was imitating 
the wrong personality.
By this time, the sun had gone 
for good, with no hope of return. 
The rain was dribbling down and 
spattering in through the open win
dow, and the cold breeze was play
ing havoc with us. An attendant up 
there rolled down the huge window, 
and the breeze stopped with the 
elimination of the splattering of 
rain. But yours was lost, because 
it was no longer possible to hear the 
loud-speaker announcing who was 
in what play! Immediately in his 
amateurish notes, our friend of the 
enviable position began to note 
Tech (or Lehigh) did so-and-so 
instead of Whosis (or Dosis) doing 
this-and-thus.
The breeze and infiltration of 
moisture had been stopped, but the 
cold was still with us. Our fingers 
were blue with cold (the scout be
side us had a little bottle to keep 
him warm, but it didnt contain 
hot water), and we stiff-fingered 
our pencils on for our heroic job of 
reporting the game.
Incidentally, we might mention
here that the unprepared reported 
had only taken upon himself the 
job of noting the game when he got 
in the press box, because he did 
not want to feel strange up here, 
with everyone else writing. But 
writers were in the minority up 
here in the peanut heaven of the 
privileged. Yours was one of the 
few.
We dont know what people have 
to do to get up in the shelter of the 
fourth estate. Evidently, there is 
little requirement needed or asked. 
A couple of men from the band 
sought haven there, and a lot of 
people were there who seemed to 
have just come up there because 
they could. (Not to mention yours 
truly, of course.) One person we 
talked with was there because some
one had slipped him a couple of 
tickets. Oh, well, barring rain or 
hurricane yours truly will be just 
as contented with the standsmay
be!

This Saturday the Tech team will 
take the field against the University 
of West Virginia. Once again Tech 
will be fighting a heavier team. 
Once again the injuries that the 
team has sustained will be an added 
factor in favor of the opposition. 
Once more Techs sloppy playing 
will probably enable the Mountain
eers of West Virginia to walk off 
with the decision. This time we are 
not playing a team that has yet to 
play its first game of the season, 
for West Virginia has already play
ed four games to our three.
But maybe the Tartans will 
buckle down this time and play 
some of the type of ball that they 
played against the star-studded 
Rochester team three weeks ago 
. . . time will tell.
According to the latest informa
tion, Errett Rodgers, coach, is still
undecided about his starting line, 
but the backfield combination is 
fairly certain. At quarterback will 
be Bob Dutton, one of the four re
turning lettermen. Kenneth Fryer, 
returning to W.V.U. after two years 
in the army is a sure choice at full
back. At right half will be Scotty 
Hamilton of basketball fame, while 
left half is still to be decided be
tween Wilson and Helsinski.
Probable starting lineup:
LE W. Anderson.. 22 180 5-2
LT Tony Paulin... 23 190 6
LB Charles Boyles 18 175 5-10
C Russel Lopez . 20 183 6-3
RG Richard Pence 17 170 5-11
RT Smith .............. 185
RE Patrick Pike . 20 195 6-1
QB Robert Dutton 24 190 5-7
LH Chas. Helsinski 22 188 5-11
RH Scot. Hamilton 22 200 5-10
FB Kenny Fryer .. 25 210 5-11
NOW signalmen can 
wear helmets with this 
INT headset!
SIGNALMEN formerly saw action without helmets because 
old-style headsets were too bulky. Now miniature re
ceivers with earplugs are being used for both radio and 
telephone work.
Fitting snugly under the helmets they give better recep
tion by keeping out battle noise ... they are cooler, more 
comfortable.
Signal Corps engineers working with Western Electric 
and Bell Telephone Laboratories developed this new all
purpose military headset.
Here is another instance of Bell System ser
vice to our nation at war.
War calls keep Long Distance lines busy

Former Eve. School Student 
Distinguishes Self Over Italy
Back from the fighting front has 
come First Lt. Arnold P. Anex. 
Night school studentswill remem
ber Lt. Anex, who attended the eve
ning College of Engineering for four 
years before enlisting in the Army 
Air Corps two and one half years 
ago. He is a member of Nu Sigma 
Alpha and Sigma Delta Phi frater
nities.
Lt. Anex has many interesting ex
periences to tell. As navigator on 
a flying fortress, he has completed 
50 missions in the Mediterranean 
war theater. On one of these mis
sions over the San Giovanni ferry 
near Messina, he narrowly escaped 
when a piece of flak tore in the plane 
and lodged in the radio near the ta
ble at which he was sitting. He was 
with the first flight of planes that 
took part in the historical bombing 
of Rome.
After his visit with his parents, 
Mr .and Mrs. Arnold A. Anex of 
557 Shelbourne Street, Wilkinsburg, 
Lt. Anex will leave for the air base 
at Dversburg, Tennessee.
Heres wishing Arnold the best of 
luck and Happy Landings until 
he again resumes his studies in the 
evening school of Carnegie Tech.
*7<4e CdlitoA,
As a first year evening student at 
Tech, I am going to express my 
opinion of the water situation, 
which is very easy. The fountains 
that work spout forth warm water. 
Just how long this condition has ex
isted. I do not know, but it should 
be eliminated because any student 
who will sit in class for 50 minutes 
studying a dry subject deserves a 
cool, refreshing drink of water or 
some other stimulant to revive him 
for the next class. I believe that if 
some effort is made to get adequate 
drinking service in the school, the 
necessary equipment could be se
cured. It is my belief that if cool
ers are being made at all, Tech 
should be able to secure at least a 
few to relieve the situation.
I have talked to numerous stu
dents and the reports that I have 
received have all bee n in total 
agreement with those which I have 
expressed.

What Romeo garbed in G. I. cloth
ing met Norma Boss, Fine Arts stu
dent, after class Monday night?
. . . Indian Summer cant be the 
cause of this, or can it, Norma?
. . . We hear that Lawrence Diener 
purchased a dictionary recently 
. . . Hm! Wonder if thats where 
he got all those big words for his 
English theme . . . Unveil that
beautiful vocabulary, Larry, and let 
us hear more of it . . .It may be 
worthy to note that a few of the 
Evening students were seen to 
have been helping out over in Car
negie Inn lately. Nice going, girls. 
.Thats what I call ambition . . . 
Something new has been added. The 
Plaid staff is rapidly increasing in 
number. A few new ager report
ers turned up last week  Their 
scoops? Anything from soup to 
nuts . . . Incidentally, one could 
hardly help noticing that A1 paced 
the floor last weekWe cant figure 
out why Nancy didnt show up 
either, Al. (Chin up, A1 . . . Pan
ama Hattie wont be gone forever)
. . . We hear she has adopted a 
theme song that fits the situation 
like a glove. She now goes around 
singing, Goodby dear, Ill be back 
in a year . . . Couldnt help notic
ing a few Maggie Murphs walking 
around the campus starry-eyed 
Yes, girls, were also sorry that the 
A. S. T.s have to leave their Juliets 
to return to an evening of study at 
7:30 P. M. . . . Wonder why Mil
dred Papa changed her mind about 
attending the election party at Mar
garet Morrison  Could it be that 
Paratroopers have a habit of drop
ping in unexpectedly? Gee ! Its 
amazing what we know nowadays 
. . . What Cinderella in borrowed 
clothing left a pair of brown gloves 
at the Election Party? . . . Haste 
makes waste they say . . . Glad 
to see the Evening school students 
at the Pep Rally last Friday night at 
the Gym  Their familiarity with 
the yells was proof enough of their 
loyalty to dear old Tech . . . Whats 
this we hear from the staff about 
Square dancing and Polkas? Seems 
to me that things are jumping lately

Professor Trinks 
Letter of Thanks
Dear friends:
Many thanks for the part which 
you took in making the Carnegie 
Tech Trinks testimonial dinner a 
success, no matter whether you con
tributed time and energy in making 
the arrangements, or your presence, 
or a letter, telegram or long distance 
call, or sharing in the expense.
So much honor was bestowed 
upon me that I almost broke down. 
However, I managed to keep a stiff 
upper lip and a smile.
My work in the war effort is 
scheduled to last until August 1944. 
Revision of my books will require 
another year. I expect to be active 
in engineering for several years and 
to finally retire to Fort Necessity 
Junior, which is located two and a 
half miles from Fort Necessity.
With kindest regards,
Willibald Trinks.

Election Party Highlights
In order to let you 755 who 
werent able to attend the election 
party know just how much fun and 
frolic you missed, wed like to give 
you a few of the highlights that oc
curred during the evening.
As human beings, our primary 
thoughts were the food situation. 
Our council president very accom
modatingly put our minds at ease by 
ushering us into the kitchen upon 
our arrival. Low and behold  
plenty of eats for all. As the gath
ering grew and the last of we fortyfive had been ushered in, our atten
tion was centered on the dance 
music furnished by a recording ma
chine. Dancing continued until the 
arrival of the KDKA Television 
Kids, one of whom was a black boy 
who played the drums; another 
member of the duet was an accordian player. The music was so 
solid the boys were summoned 
back to the stage by our applause.
Council president opened the 
meeting, and* the College Officers 
were appointed. Before the meet
ing adjourned, Nancy Lewis, who 
will soon be leaving for Panama, 
was presented with a shoulderstrap bag as a parting gift from her 
friends.
We were all pleased to see Lt. Bill 
Hurtt and Pvt. Bob Augnst present 
at the party.
When the meeting was closed we 
resumed our dancing and were un
expectedly entertained by the agile 
Joe Ryman who showed us a new 
type of Virginia Reel. Joe became 
so engrossed in the dance he for
got to keep his feet on the floor, and 
dispelled the theory that reflex re
action is quicker than normal reac
tion. Quicker than a flash grace
ful Joe was flat on his dorsal area. 
After his composure, dancing was 
continued by the group, including 
polkas which tired us sufficiently to 
speed us on our homeward way. 
How about it, you 755, why not 
join the fun next time?
