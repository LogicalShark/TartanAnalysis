P. A. A. WALKED AWAY.
The only way to describe the basbetball game between the Varsity and 
Pittsburgh Athletic Association of last 
Thursday night is to say that it was 
an off night for the Carnegie five and 
the veterans had everything their 
way. This does not mean that our 
boys lay down on the job, but they 
never got started.
The P. A. A. team is made up of 
amateur stars whose names are known 
to every follower of the floor game 
in scholastic and collegiate circles of 
this region. They have acquired ex
cellent team work and now form one 
of the strongest aggregations around 
the city. The only noticeable hole in 
their team was that left by the ab
sence of Dr. Marks, their captain and 
our coach.
The game started with a rush on 
the part of the Association team, our 
boys appearing nervous and uncer
tain. Ralston secured the first goal 
from the floor, which was followed 
by a foul on Lambie. Douthett was 
successful in shooting the first. The 
remainder of the initial period was 
monopolized by the P. A. A., except 
for one goal from the floor by Hall. 
Our boys had but few chances to 
shoot and failed to make good on 
those.
In the second half Colvin broke 
away for two baskets in a short period 
and redeemed himself somewhat. 
Heisel shot the only other goal of 
the game. Kesselman caused some 
amusement to the spectators with the 
energy with which he guarded his 
man, but he was quite effective.
No other player on the team even 
approached Foster Ralston in starring 
ability. The former Pittsburgh High 
School star, who also played on our 
190S team, showed a wonderful 
amount of basketball ability. Not 
only did he secure six goals from the 
floor, but he scored on ten free chanc
es out of eleven possibilities, running 
up a score of 22 points. McGary also 
performed briliantly for the veteran 
team. Rosser showed up well in floor 
work, but failed to score until the 
second half.
The Plaid five took their defeat 
very much to heart and the result will 
not be duplicated this season. Daily 
practicewhich had been lacking dur
ing the preceding week on account of 
the severe weatherwill be resumed 
and the work of the five brought up 
to its former standard.

THE UNIVERSITY CLUB 
CONCERT.
The annual University Club concert 
given by the Tech Musical Clubs 
last Saturday night was a com
plete success, being enjoyed by every
one. Located in front of the big fire
place, in the game room, the Tech 
men were kept plentifully supplied 
with oil and combustible materials 
while playing. At the conclusion of 
the concert all adjourned to the ban
quet hall where a bountiful repast 
was served, and, with plenty of song, 
everyone filled up till a tickling sensa
tion behind the ears indicated quitting 
time.
With cigars, speeches were made 
by the officers and directors of the 
clubs. Director Scalzo and McDowell 
of the Mandolin and Glee Clubs, point
ed out a number of points to be ob
served to make a succesful club. The 
gist of the remarks by the officers 
dwelt on the faithful efforts of the 
individual as necessary to a harmoni
ous whole. After the Alma Mater 
and a round of cheers the affair broke 
up.
PRIZE COMPETITION.
Mr. Hornbostel, of the Design 
School, has offered a prize to the Il
lustrators for the best series of six 
drawings showing the adventures or 
misadventures of tyvo students or 
near-students. The first prize is 
$35.00, and the second $15.00. All 
drawings must be completed by Feb. 
12th, and it is hoped that the. Tar
tan may be able to secure the prize 
series for publication.
CIVILS MEET.
The January meeting of the Civil 
Engineering Society was held last 
Saturday evening in Room 55, Science. 
The proposed Articles of Federation 
of the Federated Engineering Socie
ties were accepted by a big majority 
vote. Mr. Boyd and Mr. Bailey were 
appointed to take care of the societies 
representation in the Thistle. Mr. 
Kaul was appointed to represent the 
Civils upon the committee having the 
Engineers hop in hand.
After the transaction of business, 
Prof. Stanton gave an illustrated lec
ture upon Railroad Signaling and 
Interlocking. The lecture wasvery 
interesting because of its practical na
ture.
Smokes and refreshments concluded 
the program.
THE BIG EVENT.
Dont forget that on the 16th of 
February, 1912, the most successful 
social even*, ever held at Carnegie is 
to be pulled off. When some ivory 
top asks you what this is dont cut 
him all up. Just tell him that it is 
the Junior Prom of the class of 1913. 
Heap coals of fire on his head and 
tell him that it is to be held at the 
Hotel Schenley and also that it is 
bound to be a hummer. Elucidate 
further and tell the wop that all he 
needs to join the merry throng is a 
good reputation, five (5) beans and 
membership in an eligible class. Good 
wops that are eligible must be mem
bers of one of the following classes 
of the Science or Design School: 
Junior Day, Senior Day, Fourth Year 
Might, Fifth Year Night.
And say, boys, by the time you read 
this model of modern English litera
ture the tickets will be out and half 
sold, so squeeze your way through 
the crowd to Chairman Parry and get 
your permit to swing. If the fiver 
sticks to your cigarette rollers, just 
think of Gounods best playing In 
the Shadows for a schottische, and 
there will be no pain at all in the 
parting.
And the programs. Just wait till 
you see thotee programs. There is just 
one word in the English language 
that describes them and that word is 
classy. From the gold monogram 
on the front cover to the watered silk 
back they are class and thats all 
that can be said about them.
A tip from the inside says: Boys, 
get there if you have to mortgage 
your homes, and you will have some
thing good to tell to your grandchil
dren.
THE PROM COMMITTEE.
FACULTY PLAY HARRISBURG.
The Faculty bassketball team, min
us the services of Dr. Marks, who was 
detained in Pittsburgh by sick stu
dents, took a flying trip to Harris
burg. There they put up a classy 
game, losing to the Harrisburg Col
legians by a score of 39 to 33.
The pedagogues were seriously 
handicapped by a waxed floor, but 
wound up the first half with the score
25 to 24 against them. The intense 
cold affected the gas lights, which be
came dim during the final period and 
finally caused the calling of the game 
with seven minutes to play.
Rosser, of the P. A. A., filled Dr. 
Mark's position, and Ranck, of Lan
caster Y. M. C. A., took the place 
of the fifth man. Ranck and Ramsdell starred for the Faculty. The lat
ter, playing his first game in five years, 
secured four field goals and threw 
seven fouls out of nine trials. Nebinger and Gaffney starred for Har
risburg.

THE DIRECTOR TO SPEAK AT 
WESTINGHOUSE CLUB.
IT COSTS $2.00
to take your girl to the theatre. Why 
not buy a Thistle and spend two or 
three evenings showing it to her?
On Thursday, January 18, Director 
Hamerschlag is to deliver an address 
before the Westinghouse Club of Wilkinsburg. His subject is Educational 
Efficiency, with the sub-title, Con
trasting the European methods with 
American, showing the relationship 
of systems to the individual and how 
the method is affected by the demand 
for trained experts.---------o-------
IT IS A MISTAKE 
to say that the Thistle Board edit The 
Thistle. They are merely chosen by 
their classes to systematize and man
age the work. YOU furnish the ma
terial.
MHO CLUB.
The January meeting of the Mho 
Club was held last Wednesday at 8:30 
p. m. in Room 121. The business dis
cussion was short. The speaker of 
the evening was J. A. Clark, a 1911 
graduate of the Electrical Depart
ment, and now with the MacbethEvans. Glass Co. Mr. Clarks general 
topic was Illumination. He dis
cussed the characteristics and the val
ue of all lamps in practical use today. 
He also explained the method used 
in practice for determining the size, 
number, and position of lamps to be 
used in satisfactorily illummating any 
space.
To say that the talk was a hit 
would be expressing it mildly. It was 
very interesting as well as very in
structive, and was greatly appreciated 
by everyone present. The one regret
table incident was that the attendance 
was not up to the standard. How
ever, the ones who had enough spirit 
to show up were fully repaid.---------o---------
THERE IS NO EXCUSE 
for not buying a Thistle. If you have 
the money pay $2.00 and dont be 
tight;* if you havent, solicit advertis
ing and get a liberal commission, or 
sell 30 books and get one free.

Owing to the favorable comment 
concerning the cartoon which ap
peared in last weeks issue of The 
Tartan, the Editorial Board has de
cided to make this a regular monthly 
feature. Any suggestions as to the 
subjects to be touched upon will be 
very welcome.
THE BEANERY ISSUE.
Next week is one of the semi-an
nual gloom weeks, at least for the 
students in the schools of Applied 
Science and Design. Despite the hero
ic efforts made by the various mem
bers of The Tartan staff we are afraid 
that some premonition of our pre
destined predicament may have been 
precipitated into this issue. When 
such events bear upon maturing minds 
it is difficult to cast them off long 
enough to get to press with our pul
sating publication. And so, looking 
ahead into the gloom, we determined 
to see at least one bright spot. The 
harder we looked, the darker did the 
gloom loom. Hence the next issue 
of the Tartan will be called The 
Beanery Issue. Do you get it?
It is with pleasure that the Tartan 
makes the announcement that during 
the second semester the Thursday 
Morning Lectures for all day Science 
men, which were so popular last year, 
will be resumed. This is a means of 
bringing all of the students together 
once a week, a need which has been 
greatly felt during the first term. It 
is not only a pleasure to listen to the 
addresses of men who have attained 
high places in their chosen fields, but 
a great advantage to the students 
where they can meet once a week on 
common ground and discuss matters 
of general interest. And the fact that 
Mr. McDowell will again be with us 
from time to time is good news to all 
who know him, for who ever heard such
cheering and singing in 209, as when 
we were led by the smiling face and 
inspiring gestures of Mr. McDowell. 
o 
EXAMINATIONS.
The following communication was 
received from Dean Leete on the sub
ject of examinations and it is with 
great pleasure that The Tartan pub
lishes it on its editorial page. It is 
upon a subject of timely interest and 
with the thoughts expressed The Tar
tan is in entire accord. The attitude 
the Dean recommends is the only one 
which a true student and future en
gineer can possibly take. It is 
to be hoped that the course so clearly 
pointed out by the Dean will be fol
lowed by all the students during the 
coming week. The communication is 
as follows:
To the Tartan:
I always approach an examination 
period with foreboding, for too often 
some thoughtless student succumbs to 
the strain that comes from the extra 
demand made upon his honesty and 
integrity. Such a thing is, I am glad 
to say, becoming more and more un
usual here. It is to avoid a single 
such occurrence that this letter is 
written.
Students sometimes regard the sem
ester examinations as a battle between 
Faculty and Students. From this 
viewpoint the work of the semester 
becomes a preliminary maneuvering 
for position, with daily skirmishes, and 
at monthly intervals a minor engage
ment attended by more or less severe 
casualties. At the close of the semes
ter the lines of battle are closely 
drawn. The Faculty have secured 
the advantage of position. They are 
drawn up on an almost unscalable 
height, securely intrenched behind 
fortifications, with sharpshooters 
placed at every loophole ready and 
anxious to pick off every man in the 
attacking force who shows a single 
vulnerable point.
Such an estimate of examinations 
is, of course, utterly foolish. The 
Faculty and Students are not drawn 
up on opposing sides, but are together 
attacking the problems of technical 
training. The instructors are the offi
cers leading the charge, after a semes
ter of coaching and training to pre
pare the men to surmount the diffi
culties before them. The examina
tion is but a trial, to assist in de
termining whether the joint work of 
student and instructor has afforded the 
training necessary to enable the force 
to go on with the campaign success
fully. A true understanding of the 
reasons for and value of examinations 
would prevent many thoughtless 
lapses in honesty.
It is generally not difficult to draw 
the line between honesty and dishon
esty. The line between what may 
be done with honor and what spells 
dishonor is, however, not so easily 
determined. It is the cultivation of 
this finer sense of honor for which 
we are striving in these Schools.
President Tucker of Dartmouth Col
lege saysThe training toward honor 
is a training first toward sensitiveness 
to what is just, right, and true, and 
then a training of the will to enforce
this finer sense in action. It is this 
finer sense that makes for good sports
manship in athleticsa quality which 
insures something more than a formal 
observance of the rules of the game. 
The teams of these Schools and the 
student body at large have already 
made a determined stand in this direc
tion. It is this finer sense of honor 
that in industrial work assures not 
only compliance with legal require
ments as to honest products, but also 
inspires trust and confidence in the 
man behind the product. It is this 
finer sense of honor which in the pro
fessional man guarantees his clients 
not only learned opinions, but disin
terested and loyal service. This finer 
sense of honor in matters of scholar
ship would prevent not only the dis
honest act in examinations, but would 
produce such an attitude that all tempta
tion toward dishonesty would be re
moved.
The adoption of the honor system 
in our Senior Class is a marked step 
in advance  toward the cultivation of 
the sense of honorable responsibility. 
The gain has been not so much in 
the fact that the slight possibilities 
toward dishonesty which might have 
existed in a Senior Class have been 
eliminated, but because the class has 
taken a positive stand by pledging 
its honor to maintain honesty with
out supervision. I hope that this 
action will have a great influence upon 
the attitude of the three lower classes, 
and that there may be no lapse on 
the part of a single individual in the 
coming examinations. A reputation 
for thorough training and for the de
velopment of the finest sense of honor 
would prove the greatest asset these 
Schools could possess.
Yours sincerely,
JOHN H. LEETE.

THISTLE SUBSCRIPTIONS OUT.
For the past ten days, the Subscrip
tions to the 1912 Thistle have been 
solicited, and have met with a ready 
response in several of the classes, 
while in the other classes the re
sponses have been slower. This should 
not be the case, as The Thistle is an 
all-school book, published by the 
classes in the four schools which are 
representative of the Junior year, in 
the Day and Night Classes. The book 
will be absolutely non-partisan to any 
school, and it is up to the members 
of the different schools to see that 
plenty of material is supplied.
There will not be any more books 
printed than there are subscriptions, 
so that it will be necessary to sub
scribe before February 15th if you 
wish a book.
The subscription price of $2.00 is 
less than that paid for any college 
annual in this vicinity and much less 
than in the big eastern universities 
where from $3.00 to $5.00 is the pre
vailing price. It has been found from
6 years experience that there was al
ways a big deficit by charging $1.50, 
so that the Thistle Board only charge 
$2.00 to meet expenses.
Therefore Subscribe Now.

PRINCETON ELECTS NEW 
PRESIDENT.
Dr. Hibben Succeeds Gov. Wilson.
Last Thursday the Board of Trust
ees of Princeton University elected 
Dr. John Grier Hibben to succeed 
Woodrow Wilson as President of the 
University. Dr. Hibben now holds 
the Stuart Chair of Logic and is very 
popular with both students and alum
ni. He graduated from Princeton 
with the class of 1882, being the class 
president during the Senior year which 
means that he holds the office for 
life. In recent years he has been in 
great demand as a speaker at under
graduate and alumni gatherings on 
account of his great popularity.
Dr. Hibben has lectured and writ
ten much upon his subject. In the 
Faculty Song, which is sung by the 
seniors every spring he is called the 
whitest man in all the .fac. His 
choice by the Trustees promises to 
be a universally popular one. The 
office of president has been vacant 
now for over a year, Dr. Wilson re
signing on October 20th, l9l0.

WOULDNT YOU BE PROUD
to say that Carnegie Tech has 1,200 
persons in school who have spirit 
enough to buy the year-book? Last 
year there were only 450 out of an 
enrollment of 2,400. Have you gotten 
yours yet?

THE TARTAN3
OZUMaEu Klw OwsG FX$ UaM2B
To Be a Traveling Fellowship.
A new club has been or is to be 
formed, we are told, by some of the 
members of the Faculty. The new
comers have decided to call them
selves The Amalgamated Society of 
Auto-Talkers, and it was stated to 
us that we should from the name be 
able to gather the purpose of the or
ganization. Now far be it from us, a 
humble reporter, to cast disparaging 
remarks in the face of such a resolute 
body, but we must rise to remark 
that we are of the opinion that a more 
suitable cognomen could have been 
chosen. It should have been possible 
to get one with more distinctive value. 
Everybody knows by this late rate 
that our grand institution is not one 
for the teaching of the deaf and that 
in order to disseminate a goodly 
amount of the learnings of the ages 
to a goodly number of attentive (?) 
learners the Faculty auto talk, al
though they sometimes get around it 
by giving us a taste of the tortures 
of the damned, as witness the ordeal 
prepared for us next week. Of course, 
they auto and just why they should 
pick on such a name as The AutoTalkers auto talk for the balance of 
us for some time to come.
Now, as we said before, we have 
nothing to do about this matter but 
to present to our readers the facts as 
handed to us. Here are the facts. 
The Auto-Talkers have decided to 
have four classes of memberships and 
they are as follows. First, and high
est, the Active Members; second, the 
Near-Active Members; third, the Pas
sive Members; and lastly and lowest, 
the Near-Passive Members. The Ac
tives are those fortunate ones who are 
in the proud possession of autos and 
the Near-Actives are those who auto 
be. At the present time there are 
three Actives: the Director, Professor 
Wurts, and Mr. Weidlein. The NearActives consist of Mr. Orbin. There 
was considerable discussion as to the 
standnig of Dean West, as it was held 
by several that she should come under 
this classification on the grounds that 
if she did not own a taxi by this time 
she auto. (Notice that we can not re
strain ourselves when we have a 
chance to work that joke.) The mat
ter was finally referred to the Com
mittee of Classification and will prob
ably end in the creation of a new class 
called the Autobnear-Actives. We 
think that the best way out.
The third, or Passive section, is by 
far the largest in point of size if not 
of pocket-book. The following men 
are members: Prof. Willett, Prof. Mott, 
Prof. Hower, Prof. Bergey, Mr. 
Pfouts, and Mr. Field. These are all 
men who have passed through the 
Near-Passive stage, and are in fact 
fast approaching the Near-Active de
gree. The fourth section, called the 
Near-Passive, is the lowest and con
sists of those men who have been 
seen riding in public on the front seat 
of an automobile. Coach Ramsdell 
and Mr. McCullough are members of 
this branch.
The general qualifications for mem
bership are: First, that the applicant 
be in good standing; second, that he
have the ability to talk to an automo
bile agent for twenty-seven minutes 
with a straight face. The first buyer 
is to be club demonstrator and the 
initiation fee is a free ride to all the 
other members. Prof. Trinks has un
dertaken to be the auto-sparker for 
the society while Mr. Weidlein took a 
contract to supply all the gas and air 
needed by the members. However, 
since Mr. Weidlein was placed in bad 
standing for exceeding the smoke or
dinance it is an open question wheth
er or not he will be allowed to fulfill 
his desired contract. Mr. Connelley 
said that he had no need for an auto 
as he could make speed enough with
out one and therefore refused to join.
We predicate a great future for this 
organization. Nil admirari.
IRISH PLAYERS.
The College Club has secured an 
engagement with the Irish National 
Players from the Abby Theater Co. 
of Dublin, who created such a sensa
tion recently in N. Y. The date is 
Tuesday, January 23rd, at Carnegie 
Music Hall, and they will present The 
Playboy of the Western World, and 
the Workhouse Ward. It is hoped 
that there will be a good turnout from 
the Schools, as special rates, as low 
as fifty cents will be given to stu
dents.

-----------------------------o-----------------------------------
NEW TEXT BOOK.
Prof. Thayer, of the Civil Depart
ment, has written a book on the Ele
ments of Structural Design, which 
is now in the hands of the publishers. 
It is a treatise on the details of de
sign in wood, and covers materials 
and methods in steel construction.
The volume is to contain about 250 
pages, one-sixth of which are to be 
given to illustrations, and it is hoped 
that it will be ready by the beginning 
of next term, so that it may then be 
used here as a text book. It is in
tended to be the first of a series of 
three, the second of which will deal 
with the design of simple structures 
and the third with that of more ad
vanced structures.
ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST.
There will be a mass meeting of all 
the night students in the School of 
Applied Science on the evening of 
Friday, January 19th, upon the close 
of the final examination. The ques
tion to be taken up is that of the fix
ing up of the general club and smok
ing room.* * *
There are many interesting things 
happening up in the Shanty about 
which the average student knows 
nothing. Recently a pair of boxing 
gloves was purchased and the manly 
sport indulged in by the various mem
bers on the Shantys corps. Some 
very fine talent was uncovered and 
now, through the efforts of Victor 
Rigamount, these artists may be pro
cured for outside exhibits. A chal
lenge is to be issued by Manager Rig
amount on behalf of his protege, M. 
M. Steen, to meet all comers at 165 
lbs. A dark horse now known as 
Scotty, is to be shortly brought to 
light. One old favorite now work
ing there is to go into training and 
his advent into the field should make 
things all the more interesting. We 
mean Red Jones. Manager Riga
mount promised to keep the public 
informed as to the state of affairs and 
will _ gladly make arrangements to 
show at any smokers or entertain
ments, only a fee large enough to sat
isfy the managers needs being asked.
* * *
The members of the M. M. C. S. 
Dramatic Club are at present vieing 
with one another for the principle 
characters in As You Like It. Only 
the woodland scenes will be played 
I as the performances will be given out 
of doors during the last of May.
Little John was reported as doing 
very nicely at the Mercy Hospital, 
where he was taken last week. He is 
expected to be in condition to be 
: about shortly.? * *
T. J. Williams, Plebe in Section F. 
Science, was taken ill with pneumonia 
last Friday and was taken to the 
Mercy Hospital by Dr. Marks.
* * *
The M. M. C. S. Alumni Associa
tion gave a dance at the Bellefield 
Club on Tuesday evening, January 
9th. There were about forty couples 
there to enjoy the affair.* * *
Director Hamerschlag and Dean 
Leete spoke at the dinner given by
the Dartmouth Club of Western Pennj 
sylvania to President Fox, of Dart-1 
mouth College, at the University Club 
on the evening of the 9th.* * *
Mr. Tarbell was called East last 
week by the sickness of his sister, 
who was forced to undergo an oper
ation. The Tartan trusts that it will 
not prove serious and that we may 
soon have Mr. Tarbell with us again.* * *
Last Friday evening Dean West 
spoke to the Hilltop branch of the 
Young Womens Christian Associa
tion.* * *
Mr. Richard T. Crane, of Chicago, 
died on January 9th. It will be re
membered that Mr. Crane was a 
strong hater of colleges and what col
leges stood for and seldom lost an 
opportunity to relieve his mind on 
that subject. He had made his way 
in life without the advantage of a 
college training and he was of the 
opinion that all others should do the 
same as the time spent in an institu
tion of higher learning was wasted. 
He took occasion to say many things 
about Carnegie Tech and its founder, 
which we know to be untrue and the 
remarks of a biased mind.* * *
Throughout the second semester the 
hour from 11 to 12 on Thursday morn
ing, will be given up to a course of 
lectures before the students of all 
classes of the School of Applied Sci
ence. Some of the time of this period 
will also be given to school singing 
under McDowell.
* *
It is proposed to move the Electri
cal Department from its present loca
tion to Machinery Hall and devote this 
entire building to the use of the Sta
tionery, Mechanical and Electrical 
Departments. One of the features of 
the building will be an automobile 
testing laboratory and a street rail
way materials testing plant.
* * *
A Power Plant Committee, to en
large and develop the power plant at
C. T. S. has been appointed by the Di
rector. It consists of Supt. Weidlein, 
Supervisor of Equipment Orbin, Prof. 
Trinks and Prof. Wurtz.
* * *
Mr. and Mrs. Leete are to enter
tain the Executive Council and the 
Faculty of the School of Applied Sci
ence on Saturday evening, January 
30th.* * *
Dr. Davisson, of the Heat Depart
ment has been asked to deliver a 
paper before the annual meeting of 
the American Electro-Chemical So
ciety at Boston next April. He will 
probably take for his subject, Elec
trical Emission from Heated Salts.* * *

THE CARNEGIE MEMORY BOOK
Just the thing you have been looking for.
A LITTLE CATECHISM ON 
EXAMS.
A Tartan reporter was standing in 
the corridor the other day when a 
visitor chanced to stop near him. 
Thinking that perhaps he might be 
able to obtain a story from such a 
distinguished looking person, the re
porter spoke to the gentlemen. In
stead of obtaining any item of news 
the reporter was put through a cate
chism which ran something as fol
lows:
What is this constant noise I hear 
in these buildings?
That, Sir, is the noise of the grinds 
turning the grindstones.
Is it always as loud as this?
No, but you see at this time of the 
year all excepting a few are hard at 
work at the wheel.
What, may I ask, are the few doing?
Wishing, O Ignorant One, that they 
had been grinds also.
Can you tell me, You Giver of Light, 
if the grinds are innocuous?
To all except themselves. To them
selves they are------------. There goes
one. See how his shoulders are 
rounded. Notice how pale his face 
is. Observe how pointed his nose is. 
Deduce the result.
Sad, sad, especially in one so young. 
But why is it that at this season of 
the 365 days that go to make up the 
year of 1912 that all desire to imitate 
the example of yon?
Because Mid-Years come next week.
And what, pray tell, are Mid-Years.
They are a spasm which attacks all 
except the grinds of grinds in the 
middle of the year.
Painful?
Damnable.
To what purpose then are these 
spasms?
That, dear learner, is just the rea
son, to find the purpose.
Elucidate. Keep me not in sus
pense.
It is simple. It is to find the pur
pose of our taking residence in such 
a wind swept portion of the City of 
Pittsburgh, state of Pennsyldelphia, as 
Schenley Park that these agonizing 
institutions are perpetrated upon the 
innocent students, follow me?
What is the efficiency of such a 
medieval weapon?
The in-put divided by the out-put, 
they like to tell us.
Can you not give me a figure. I 
always like to be definite and accurate, 
you know. That is the only frame of 
mind for an engineer, as is proven 
by the slide rule.
The efficiency varies for the differ
ent classes. Take the Seniors for 
example. This will make the sixth 
test to which they protestingly have 
had to submit. They are on to all 
the tricks of the trade, as the boys 
say. They do not lose their heads, for 
example. Therefore, their efficiency 
is higher.
This is all very strange to me. Does 
any single person like this sort of a 
week?
Only the janitors.
Why the janitors, Fountain of Light 
that you are?
Because they do not have so many 
rooms to clean. Goodbye, my friend, 
call again. I have a friend who has
promised to turn the stone for me 
and so I must away. Adieu, but not 
goodbye. I may meet you out in the 
great wide world after next week.
-------------o-------------
FULCRUM CLUB HAS MEETING.
The Fulcrum Club had its regular 
monthly meeting in the club room 
last Wednesday evening. The meet
ing was of a purely business nature, 
many things of importance being set
tled. After adjournment refresh
ments were served and enjoyed by 
all.
The next regular meeting will be 
held on February 14th, and as the 
officers for the second term will then 
be elected, it is hoped that the full 
membership will turn out.
--------------o-----------------------
BAND.
Until further notice, the Tech Band 
will hold rehearsals on Monday and 
Friday evenings of each week at 5 
oclock sharp.

sity Club next Saturday night with
out fail. There will be rehearsals of

typographical error.
This usually veracious (or is it vora
cious?) and conservative document 
proclaims a lecture on the Evolu.tion of Architecture. It must mean supposing that you can lightly assume 
the "Evolution of Anarchy, or nerlhc mher hubbard manners peculiar

reverent use of the manifold hard

mal dinners, and this last is going 
some. But dont make the mistake of
or per 
Artistic
Temperament. You will observe the 
alliteration. After all it is not im
possible that the official announce
ment may be correct. The evolution 
of the vociferous style of architecture 
prevalent in this strident Twentieth 
century, must be attended by more or 
less explosive violence. Incidentally 
there is a quite obvious explanation 
of what is professionally termed de
fective acoustics by the scientific ex
perts called into consultation -over 
these delirious modern auditoriums, 
where irate patrons of lecture or al
leged musical entertainment are wont 
to protest that they did not part with 
their late lamented cash to hear ora
tory apparently afflicted with the 
blind staggers, nor music with the 
Katzenjammers. It is really not de
fective construction at all, as the sound 
doctors assert, it is the disorderly ar
chitectural trimming with which the 
walls are afflicted.
No human voice and no conspiracy 
of musical instruments could hope to 
contend with the yallerlujah chorus ! 
of the decorations (?) This explana
tion is not patented and no consulta
tion fee is asked.
Whatever be the character of the 
rites performed in this before menj 
tioned witching hour, which may 
be quite aptly called, high noon, the 
Plebes emerge in a state of spiritual 
effervescence, sus^cesting that they 
must have bee;^B arged with some 
kind of oratorical soda1 water. It re
quires a cold shower bath of physi
cal, chemical and mathematical for
mulae, with some verbal massage by 
instructors to overcome their tendency 
to float up to the ceiling like toy bal
loons.
This artistic temperament myth is 
a funny thing, when you sit down and 
contemplate it, now isnt it?
One is apt to need a first dose of 
it quite suddenly, especially if one has 
just had a heart to heart talk with 
the Dean.
As an e. restorative in the
educational world, it merits a rank 
quite co-ordinate with the perennial 
Lydias celebrated Pink Pills for Pale 
People.
When administered to students in 
the last stages of scholastic debility, 
the patients have been known to im
mediately revive, and with the subse
quent co-operation of a small sangui
nary cap, to achieve a certain serio
comic merit in a sort of ladylike sci
ence and math. But it is almost cer
tainly fatal to parrots. In incipient 
cases patients are subject to curious
to this soi distant temperament, un
less you have the nerve of a lightning 
rod agent to back them up. Other
wise, you are likely to be returned 
to your place of residence in a state 
of disintegration requiring a basket 
and cracked ice.

On Monday, January eighth, when 
Mr. Hornbostel failed to appear to 
deliver his architecture lecture, the 
Plebes held a meetjng. After con
siderable confusion, someone finally 
made himself heard, and it was moved 
and seconded that the president ap
point someone to take Mr. McCluskeys place on the board of control. 
There was a great deal of objection 
to this motion, but after some lively 
discussion it was finally passed. Mr. 
Balsinger appointed Wilmot, of Sec
tion F.
The class gave its unanimous ap
proval to this appointment on Friday, 
January twelfth.

On Friday, January twelfth, imme
diately before the Physics lecture, Mr. 
Balsinger came into the lecture room 
with his arms full of hats, caps, and 
ties of all descriptions. This was the 
signal for a wild scramble, followed 
by the disappearance of caps and ties 
(regardless of ownership) in all direc
tions.
