By Georgia White
Are Americans failing to per
ceive some excellance in Edgar 
Allan Poe that Europeans are 
conscious of? Has Poes work 
been evaluated justly?
These questions and others 
concerning this mysterious liter
ary figure will be discussed by 
Mr. Earle R. Swank, assistant 
professor of English, at next 
Tuesdays assembly, March 3, 
in the Fine Arts Theatre.
Problem Figure 
Poe seems to be a problem fig
ure in American literature. He is 
widely read but (perhaps due to 
his unusual personality) is not 
susceptible to the same kind of 
critical evaluation Americans ap
ply to other authors. He is read 
mostly in high school and appears 
neglected in college curriculum.
In Europe and particularly in 
France, Poe enjoys a tremendous 
reputation and is not restricted as 
somewhat juvenile literature. Eu
ropeans especially seem to like 
Poes innovations of a decided 
emotional quality in writing that 
he achieves through sounds of 
words and immagery .
Short Life 
Born in 1809 and living only 
until 1849, Poe experienced his 
most productive period about 
1835 when he lived in Richmond, 
Virginia, and was editor of the 
Southern Literary Messenger. 
At this time he wrote such 
things as The Narrative of 
Arthur Gordon Pym, Fall of the 
House of Usher, and The Ra
ven.
Scholarships
Scholarship applications for 
next year are now available 
in AH 154. All present schol
arship holders must reapply 
for next year regardless of 
the kind of scholarship held.
Applications must be in by 
March 15.
Greek Sing 
Tickets Needed
By Mike Brunt
Everyone attending this years 
Greek Sing competitions Friday 
evening, February 27, at Carnegie 
Music Hall must have a ticket of 
admission, according to the Panhel and CFP Greek Sing co-chair
men Marge Warner and Jack 
Roose.
The Greek Sing committee has 
issued free tickets to the sororities 
and fraternities in proportion to 
their size. A reserve of tickets has 
also been kept for the members of 
the faculty and administration 
who wish to attend the perform
ance; these tickets may be ob
tained from Jack Roose at the 
.Beta Theta Pi House.
A limitation has had to be 
placed on the number of people 
attending Greek Sing in order to 
comply with the fire ordinance. 
Previous years audiences have 
been as large as 2600, while the 
Music Hall was designed to hold 
2000 people.
The Greek Sing committee has 
suggested that inviting people out
side the Tech community to Greek 
Sing be discouraged in.order that 
more Tech students may attend 
the performance.
Greek Sing will begin at 8:00 
Friday evening and will be fol
lowed by Greek Swing Saturday 
evening, February 28, at 9:00 in 
the Syria Mosque. The Panhel 
and CFP scholarship and the 
awards for Greek Sing will be pre
sented during the intermission of 
the dance.
CFP Court of Justice Gives 
Delta Upsilon Stern Reprimand
The CFP Court of Justice, meeting last Tuesday and 
Thursday, February 18, 19, gave Delta Upsilon fraternity a 
reprimand, a disciplinary warning, and an order to submit a 
formal letter of apology to the administration for setting off
fireworks which disturbed the#---------------------------------------------------
neighborhood.
The court also recommended 
that the administration make
DUs apology known to the an
noyed neighbors. The' charges 
were brought by the school.
Disciplinary warning indicates 
that the fraternity will be held 
to a standard of behavior above 
that usually expected of the fra
ternity system.
The formal draft of the writ 
follows:
Charges
On Thursday evening and Fri
day morning, February 5th and 
6th, pledges of Delta Upsilon 
Fraternity discharged fireworks 
so as to disturb neighbors in the 
vicinity. This action has been de
trimental to the reputation of the
fraternity system and is thus a 
violation of C.F.P. regulations.
Decision
The C.F.P. Court of Justice 
finds Delta Upsilon Fraternity 
guilty of the specifications set 
forth in the charge. The Court 
herewith administers the follow
ing disciplinary actions:
1. The Court reprimands the 
members of Delta Upsilon 
Fraternity for their actions 
which, it feels expressed poor 
judgment and created ill feel
ings between the fraternity 
system and its neighbors.
2. The Court places Delta Up
silon on disciplinary warning 
for the remainder of the 
semester; similar occurrences

A Campus-to-Career Case History
Bill Burns (far right) reviews a plan for expanding Syracuses 
toll-free calling area with some fellow supervisors.
AtHe wanted more than 
just an engineering job'
William G. Bums majored in Civil En
gineering at Union College. But he had 
his own ideas about his engineering 
future. I wanted a job with a growth 
company, he says, where I could de
velop and move ahead a6 a member of 
management.
Bill found his growth companyand 
his management opportunity. On gradu
ating in June, 1954, he started work 
with the New York Telephone Company.
Six months of training and job assign
ments in Albany familiarized him with 
the Plant, Commercial, Accounting and 
Traffic functions of the telephone busi
ness. Then came 18 months as engineer 
in the Long Range Planning Group. In 
October, 1956, he was promoted to Su
pervising Engineer.
Bill was transferred to Syracuse in
August, 1958, as Supervising EngineerFundamental Plans, with a staff of four 
engineers and two clerks. In this job, 
he studies and forecasts the future tele
phone needs of customers in a 4800- 
square-mile area, planning from three to 
20 years ahead. He then co-ordinates 
the development of plans to meet future 
needs with the various engineering 
groups involved. Bill calls it manage
ment engineering.
Bill is married, has three youngsters 
and owns his ow7n home. A man has to 
build his own securityT he says, and 
finding the right place to do it can be 
mighty important. Choosing a Bell Tele
phone career was the best decision I ever 
made. I dont know where an ambitious 
young fellow can find more or better 
chances to move ahead in management.
Many young men, with degrees in the sciences, arts, engi
neering or business, are finding interesting and reward
ing careers with the Bell Telephone Companies. Ixok

interviewer when he visits your campus. And read the

44Barefoot Boy with Cheek)
THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SMOOCH
Back in my courting days (the raccoon coat was all the rage, 
everybody was singing Good Morning, Mister Zip Zip Zip, and 
young Bonaparte had just left Corsica), back, I say, in my 
courting days, the standard way to melt a girls heart was to 
write poetry to her.
I dont understand why young men today have abandoned 
this gambit. There is nothing like poetry for moving a difficult 
girl. Whats more, poems are ridiculously easy to write. The 
range of subjects is endless. You can write a poem about a girls 
hair, her eyes, her lips, her walk, her talk, her clothesanything 
at all. Indeed, one of my most effective love lyrics was called 
To Mauds Pencil Box. It went like this:
1oTflmfo pencil W' It wt likeiS'.
In your dear little leatherette pencil box 
Are pencils of yellow and red,
And if you dont tell me you love me soon,
Ill hit you on top of the head.
Honesty compels me to admit that this poem fell short of 
success. Nothing daunted, I wrote another one. This time I 
pulled a switch; I threatened myself instead of Maud.
Oh, Maid, pray stop this drivel 
And tell me youll be mine,
For my sweetbreads they do shrivel 
And wind around my spine.
My heart doth cease its beating,
My spleen uncoils atid warps,
My liver stops secreting 
Soon I needs be a corpse.
When this heart-rending ballad failed to win Maud, I could 
only conclude that she was cruel and heartless and I was better 
off without her. Accordingly I took back my Hi-Y pin, bade her 
adieu, and have not clapped eyes on her since. Last I heard, 
she was working in Galveston as a Plimsoll line.
But I did not mourn Maud long, for after Maud came Doris 
Doris of the laughing eyes, Doris of the shimmering hair, Doris 
of the golden tibiae! Within moments of meeting her, I whipped 
up a torrent of trochaic tetrameter:
Oh, my sweet and dulcet Doris!
1 love you like a Philip Morris 
With its mild and rich tobacco 
In its white and scarlet pack-o.
Id swim from Louisville to Natchez 
For Philip Morris and you and matches.
Well, of course, the dear girl couldnt resist a poem like that 
what girl could?and she instantly became my slave. For 
the rest of the semester she carried my books, washed my car, 
and cored my apples. There is no telling where it all would 
have ended if she hadnt been drafted.
So, men, you can see the power of poetry. Try it yourself. All 
you need is a rhyming dictionary, a quill pen, and a second
hand mUSe. C 1866, Mu Bhulnuta
  
Lets drop rhyme and turn to reason. The reawn Marlboro

Editor, the Tartan;
Last Fall, the organizations ed

cated with the various organiza
tions on campus about the possi
bility of reserving one full-page.
The purpose of this new system 
was that the organization could 
show what they do by means of 
candid pictures rather than cus
tomary stiff, line-up shot and as 
of this date, there have been very 
few organizations that have noti
fied us about their activities to 
which we can send a photogra
pher. It is important to us that 
we have all the organizations 
pictures taken no later than 
March 16. (We have a deadline to 
meet with our printer.)
Utmost cooperation from all 
organizations is requested. It is 
not a good policy to set down 
ultimatums, but due to lack of 
time we must state that if an or
ganization does not cooperate, 
we will have to cut down the lay
out of the book. There is no one 
that knows your organization 
better than the members them
selves. Please help us meet our

ground of Judo to be quite inter
esting.
Judo is a philosophy as well as 
an art and' sport. Its goal is pro
ficiency of both mind and body. 
In Japan, there are many special
ized schools which teach only 
Judo.
Kodokan Judo
^Kodokan Judo, the type to be 
Presented, has evolved from older 
systems, all of which sought a 
system of training the mind and 
body most efficiently. Judo in 
Japanese, means the gentle way.
I Gentleness may not be too ap
parent during the exhibition of 
the 26th.
The Pittsburgh Judo Club, 
whose exhibition will be seen, 
perfects its bodily skills in prace sessionsv called randori. 
ssions are held twice a week for 
advanced students and weekly for 
beginners.
Japan
In Japan, randori are held in a 
Dojo, Japanese for gymnasium. 
Although often attended by large 
crowds, an air of solemnity and 
ritual prevades these spectacles.
In these matches the costume, 
or Judogi, is very important. Alost all of the holds used are acally grips on the Judogi. The 
belt, or Obi, is the insignia of 
rank in the world of Judo. A 
black belt is the symbol of the 
mastery of the art and few men 
claim this title.
Shale Paul, the instructor of the 
Pittsburgh group is a holder of 
the black belt. Pauls movements 
are amazingly fast and he is con
sidered unapproachable in skill in 
^his area.

Car Pools Can 
Clear Techs 
Parking Tangle
By Dan Smyers
To relieve the parking problem, 
as well as to save cash, and to 
promo+e fellowship, students are 
urged to join car pools.
There is almost certainly some
one from your neighborhood trav
eling to and from Tech at ap
proximately the same time you 
make the trip. If class hours dont 
work out exactly right, the per
son who has to wait can benefit 
by using this time to study.
To facilitate the forming of car 
pools everyone interested is in
vited to post the following in
formation on the evening bulletin 
board located in Administration 
Hall on a sheet headed Car Pool.
Post your name, address, phone 
(home and work), days and hours
nf classes, liie watch the board 
for the ride or riders which suit 
you best. Mr. McKelway, also has 
a geographical file which may be 
used upon request to assist th^ 
forming of car pools.
Mrs. Czernek 
Speaks At Tea
Evening Student Council spon
sored a tea for all women attend
ing evening school on Sunday, 
February 15, at 2:00 at the Car
negie Union. Phi Gamma Pi 
members were the hostesses for 
the tea.
Mrs. Ralph Czernek arranged 
for Miss Peggy Quinn, a repre
sentative of Manufacturers Light 
& Heat Company, to present a 
message, technical in scope, but 
conversational in make up, on the 
discovery and progress of uses.
This was done very cleverly with
the use of aprons depicting vari
ous phases of her talk. It was en
lightening, though t-provoking, 
and certainly a different form of 
talk especially for the subject, 
and wante dto take his proposed 
Ronald Craig, vice president of 
Evening Student Council address
ed the group on the merits of 
working with and joining coun
cil. Jancy Spannuth on behalf of 
Phi Gamma Pi explained its

By Mike Berman
The Comeback Plaids of Coach Mel Cratsley managed 
to win their last two home contests against Waynesburg and 
Slippery Rock without the services of sophomore star Bill 
Soffa. Sof sustained a fractured finger in the Indiana game 
and will be lost for the remainder of the campaign.
The Tartans were able to find a very capable sub for the 
ailing Soffa in senior Tom (Whitey) Mueller. In these last 
two games Whitey hit for 28 and 21 points respectively and 
was a key driver in these two victories.
Down Waynesburg ?------------------------------------------------------
The Skibos roared in to the 
gym last February 18 fresh from 
two road victories over Allegheny,
72-55, and W&J, 70-62, and a de
feat to ISTC. They chalked up a 
76-64 victory over Waynesburg 
that night, a team which they had 
previously downed by thirty 
points.
The first half found a seesaw 
battle with neither side able to 
lead by much, but Waynesburg 
had the decider at half time 31- 
29.
The two teams continued to 
trade buckets until the mid sec
ond half when the Skibos, down 
by three points, 51-48, put on a 
spurt which gave them a 59-51 
lead which they maintained for 
the rest of the contest.
Slippsry Rock Falls
Thursday evenings contest was 
much more nerve racking as the 
semifilled gym crowd witnessed a 
narrow 84-83 victory over Slip
pery Rock Teachers.
The lead changed hands many 
times in this game while the 
score was knotted at seven in
stances. The Teachers managed to 
outplay Tech in the first half, 
leading by as many as six points,
33-32, and walking away with a 
49-39 edge at the recess.
Too Close
The Skibos bounced back from 
the break with a few quick hoops 
and some fine shooting by Whitey 
Mueller who tallied most of his 
points in this half. The deadly 
Plaids led by as many as nine 
67-58, and 77-68, with just five 
minutes of playing time left. But 
in those ensuing minutes the 
Rockets outdid our Tartans 15-7 
falling one shy of a tie.
Ken Denne threw in the equal
izer for Slippery Rock with two 
minutes to go to make the score 
82-82. In the next few minutes, 
play was fast, but shooting was 
off. Techs Miller made the final 
hoop for the Tartans while the 
Teachers Bill Keenan was only 
able to make one of two from the 
charity line giving Tech the 84- 
83 win.
Last Game
This was the last home game 
for the Tartans, who ended with a 
5-5 record at the Skibo Gym, and
tossing in which department he 
leads his teammates. He was^one 
of the big three for the Tartans 
and will be missed in that corner 
spot next season.

Englishmen, Falcons, ATO, 
K-Sigs, Favorites In B-Ball
By Chuck Vodvarka
Within the past two weeks the 
basketball leagues have unscram
bled themselves and each shows 
a prospective winner.
ATO-A downed TKN 36-29 to 
become the first place team in 
the Long Shots league. ATO has 
a well balanced team of eight 
players with game point average 
between 6 and 8. Jim Muth and 
A1 Phillips led TKN scorers with 
8 points apiece while George 
Paris scored 10 and A1 Valentine 
8 in the ATO victory.
Drive Shot League
In the Drive Shot league, the 
Kappa Sigs have sewed-up the 
title with the Delts finishing sec
ond, and the DUs third, KS, like 
ATO, has a well balanced team 
with 11 players with averages be
tween 6 and 9 points per game.
The Delts have three boys av
eraging over 10 points per game, 
and as a team they have averaged 
50. These three fellows are: Bob 
Montgomery, John Brown, and 
Jim Scott, a freshman. The total 
DU strength lies in>> the hands of 
Fred Ewing and George Eisbacher.
Set Shot League
In the Set Shot league, the Met 
Grads should take first place, but 
a scrappy Tau Delt team will 
contest them for the honor. Frank 
Spriggs and Pete Bouxsein led a 
good Sigma Nu team which bare
ly missed second place by a mar
gin of one point in a crucial 
game.
The Met Grads are a real threat 
to any team in the school. Be
sides having Ben Patz for re. 
bounding they also have scoring I 
threats in Bob Rapp, Reini Nor
man, and Burny Flur. The 
Delts rely on Bennie Perlmutter I 
and A1 Wolfson.
The Falcons have easily taken 
first in the Foul Shot league and 
are afiout an even match for the 
Met Grads. They have three AllSchool players from last year and 
the year before in Jim Trageser, 
Ed Horey, and Kemp Beall. Joe 
Ludwig and Fritz Schneidmiller 
give them added height and str
ing power. Mike Flynn, probably 
this years MVP, has made the 
Phi Kap B a contender. Alevel, led by Otto Leone, and the 
Beta Sigs, led by Bruce Wallerstein are fighting for third place 
Hook Shot League
In the Hook Shot league we 
find both the schools most well 
balanced league and the strongest 
team. The Englishmen have AllSchool choices from previ#$ 
years in Jim Beisler, Boyd Doxtader, and Jack Mehalko.
The rest of the league is one 
big battle. There are four betterthan-average teams battling for 
second place. The strongest ap
pears to be TX with two fresh
men scoring stars, Enn Epner and 
Bill Slama. Epner is a real stand
out inasmuch as he is but only 
5-6.
