DR. YUI AT 
CHAPELMON.
Special Commissioner to Dis
armament Conference 
Sec. of Chinese 
Y. M. C. A.
DISCUSSES CHINA
Carnegie Tecli was highly honor
ed last Monday By the presence of 
a distinguished visitor to our coun
try. Dr. David Yui Chinas special 
commissioner to thfe Disarmament 
Conference at Washington, spoke to 
as many students as could crowd in
to the little theater at the noon-day 
chapel meeting.
Dr. Yui is also representing the 
United Chamber of Commerce of the 
United Educational Association of 
the Chinese Empire. He has an 
M. A. degree from St. Johns Col
lege, China, as well as a honorary 
Ph. D. from the same college. In 
addition he is general secretary of 
the Y. M. C. A. of China.
Due to his travels he is in a po
sition to tell the truth to the peo
ple regarding the conditions in 
China which are much different 
from those pictured in many high-, 
ly colored newspaper reports.
lie said that, at present China is 
both divided and united. On the 
one hand are the small political 
and militaristic bodies who are con
tinually struggling for their own 
personal selfish gain, while the 
great mass of people, at large, have 
not been particularly interested. 
Rather they have grown united and 
live as happily as the people in 
other parts of the world.
Dr. Yui also spoke of the new 
movement in China termed, the 
Renaissance, which has for its pur
pose, tfie securing of a constructive 
scientific attitude amongst the mass
es, starting first with the student 
body. They are investigating the 
best that can be found in all the 
other countries of the world and to
gether with the good in their own 
land hope to establish a government 
which will be the best for China. 
They want to create a good attitude 
toward the West. At one time it wa9 
thought that China was the the cen
ter of all things,, by her people. This 
idea has changed by the methods of 
the West. This Renaissance has al
so undertaken the simplification of 
the written language which is dif
ferent from the spoken. This will 
mean greater education for the mass
es. They are striving to establish 
a 'phonetic language. Therefore 
they feel that the Renaissance will 
fill the hearts with hope and expec
tation of great things.
He poirted out just what a pow
erful factor public opinion is In 
China and cited instances to show 
this.
Referring to the Disarmament 
Conference he said that he has found 
the world at large rather skeptical 
as to the outcome of the Disarma
ment Conference, but the Chinese 
people have the utmost confidence 
in Americas leadership and they be
lieve that if Americans stand for 
constructive and Christian policies 
the success of the conference is as
sured.
Their delegation had come to pre
sent no demands, although they 
could make many. They have no 
petitions, no accusations, for which 
they have good cause and they have 
no diplomatic aspirationswhen they 
wish to accept a thing they accept 
it outright, not "in principle or 
basis for discussion.' (Great ap
plause.) They have come with a 
constructive program and if all 
came to give rather than take, much 
can be expected.
He spoke of Chinas vast re
sources, both in raw materials and

GRAPHICA XMAS CARDS
y
Over 500 Christmas cards have 
been sold already by the Graphica, 
since the opening of the campaign, 
Friday, November 18. These cards 
are being sold among the students 
and throughout Pittsburgh, by 
Graphica members and several 
agents.
This year the Graphica has seven 
very attractive cards on sale, and 
the designs on them are very ap
propriate for Christmas. These 
cards are entirely the work of th 
printing department of Carnegie 
Tech, therefore similar cards can' 
not be purchased elsewhere. For 
an exclusive Christmas card, Tech 
students cannot find a more suitable 
greeting than one of the Graphica 
cards.
The cards may be procured at the 
printing department. Room 122, In
dustries, or from any printing stu
dent. During the noon hour, sales
men with samples wi'l be stationed 
in the Central Building, the Bean
ery and the Margaret Morrison 
Cafeteria. The name of the purchase 
of the card will be printed on the 
card if it is desired. The cards are

Dancing in Langley Lab 
Little Theater Crowded
The party in celebration of the 
birthday of Andrew Carnegie, unique 
in every particular, fittingly com
memorated the anniversary of the 
birth of our Founder.
The Arts Building was decorated 
for the occasion and could not help 
but leave a most favorable impres
sion on those who attended.
Vaudeville acts were given con
tinuously iff the theater to accom
modate the seventeen hundred cele
brants and each performance boast
ed of a full house. Newmans 
darkie songs created a great deal 
of laughter as did the one act play 
The Wreck of the Hesperus."
Langley Lab. was the scene of 
dancing. A nine-piece orchestra fur
nished the harmony and many re
mained in the lab. throughout danc
ing to the latest airs.
Practically all the students who 
were in Pittsburgh over the Thanks
giving recess were there as well as 
a large number of alumni and mem
bers of the faculty.
The administration certainly de
serves a vote of thanks and we hope 
and except the Carnegie Birthday 
Party will become a tradition at 
Tech in order that we might annu
ally celebrate the birthday of the 
founder of Carnegie Tech in a fit
ting manner. Judging from the sue 
cess of the present party, a tradi
tion it will be,, and we will not for
get the "man of vigorous will, who 
used his wealth to serve his fellowmen.

Fifty Men Report to Coach

From Football Squad 
Schedule Under Way
GIBSON IS CAPTAIN
At the first call for basket bi\U 
last week more than 50 candidates 
reported to Bob Waddell who is 
handling the men until Hal hidings, 
last years coach, returns. The new 
material looks good and will make 
the veterans from last season hus
tle to hold down their jobs. Cap
tain Gibson, Bell, Dosey, Pittman 
and McCaw are the members of last 
years squad who are on deck again 
this season.
Last year the team played through 
a schedule of 26 games, winning 10 
and losing 16. Many of the games 
were lost by only a few points. The 
team always fought hard but seem
ed to lack the punch at times which 
was necessary to put across7 a vic
tory.
A very attractive schedule is be
ing completed for the winter months 
which guarantees Tech supporters' 
some good basket ball. ' As yet a 
number of the dates' are pending. 
During the holidays the team ex
pects to make a trip up through 
Ohio and into Michigan ' playing 
teams at Akron, Ann Arbor and 
Lansing.

CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM
At the first call for cross-country 
men this fall, three letter men, Cap
tain Miller, Greenlaw and Cavett re
ported along with a squad of 65 
men -with more or less running exeprience. From the new men Coach 
Thomas developed the following: 
Kelley, Dykeman, Tubbs, Menden
hall, Long, Gotham, McKelvey and 
Gottwals.
This was Captain Millers third 
season on the team. Starting as 
Freshman, it was not long before 'he 
attracted the attention of the coach 
and was placed on the regular team. 
Last year his record was perfect. 
He finished well up in both meets, 
setting a new record for the local 
course, only to .break it this year 
against Lafayette. The new record 
stands at 31:56 2-5. Miller is 
hard worker and puts everything he 
has into a race. Anyone who saw 
him finish against Lafayette will 
vouch for this.
Greenlaw, captain-elect of the 1922 
team, is another veteran who ha3 
been running several seasons. lie 
is a long-legged chap with a treM. M. SENIOR BALL

Tech Runners
Great Record
Vanquish Lehigh, Lafayette 
and State
The most successful cross-country 
season in the history of Tech closed 
with tho simultaneous ending of a 
similarly successful football year, 
The Plaid has conio to the front in 
one of its minor Sports, in a fash
ion which forecasts a most ?promis
ing future. Cross-country is a man's 
game, if there ovor was one. It 
takes those attributes known as en
durance and gamonoss along with 
inborn ability to run, to make a 
good liill and dale runner.
The men on the Tartan squad 
have put their best efforts toward 
tho goal of a successful season and 
tlioy have succeeded. Their collogiate record is untarnished after 
four straight victories and tho show
ing in the National A. A. U. Cham
pionship was remarkable.
It was by no means a weak sched
ule that tho toairi went' through. 
Their first victory over Lehigh was 
by a perfect score, 15 to 40. Six 
Tech mon finished before a Lohlgh 
man appeared. A week lator they 
met the strong Lafayette team, last 
season's Intorcolloglato champions, 
winning, by tho score of 18 to 37. It 
was the first defeat Lafayette had 
suffered In 12 years. Crawford, La
fayettes .tar, was headed by three 
Tech runners, finishing in fourth 
place.
Then to offset 1onn Stat.os foot
ball victory ovor Tech, tho Plaid 
harriers came through with a 2*1 to 
31 victory over tho State runners. 
Previous to this Penn State had not 
been defoated in llvo years over 
their own course. On Armlstlco Day

Quoting from tho recent articlo by 
William S. Whito in. the Pittsburgh, 
Post, And in the book of sports as 
it pertains to tho Plaid Institution, 
most certainly must be inscribed: 
1921'greatest of all up to this 
time,  the fact is more definitely 
than ever emphasized that the foot
ball team of this year has done won
derful work, that may have demon
strated to the satisfaction of the most 
exacting that they have placed Car
negie Tech teams in the Class A Di
vision. Looking back over the sea
son, it is a pleasure to recall the 
spirit with which the routine of prac
tice was gone through, the fellowship 
which existed and the consideration 
shown by every individual of the or
ganization for the welfare of every 
other person and factor and to realize 
how these different considerations 
made for the best team that has ever 
represented Carnegi^ Tech. The rec
ord of seven starts out of nine won 
is all the more remarkable in view 
of the fact that the team lacked in 
weight as compared to the average 
Class A team. All hail to Coach 
Wally Steffen, his assistant, Wad
dell, and all of those fine lads Of 
1921 varsity!
Those individuals who have been 
prophesying that Coach Steffen could 
show some real progress with a team 
of veterans can now surely say, "I

PLANS SUBMITTED
Although nothing definite can bo 
reported at the present time concern
ing the new gymnasium, suggestions 
and plans for the same and the pro
posed stadium in connection with it 
are numerous and of interest The 
committee appointed to caro for tlio 
planning of the building are at pres
ent considering the various locations 
on the campus that might prove suit
able.
There are five sites that are avail
able and under consideration. Tho 
first of these is the pilot now occupied 
by Woodlawn Hall on tho corner of 
Forbes street and Woodlawn' avenue. 
Then thero is tho tract of land on 
which tho present gym is greeted, 
across from the mons dormitories. 
This site Is one which 1S woll adapt
ed to tho proposed gymnasium, as It 
is closo to tho athletic field, and at 
the same time is near to tho othor 
school buildings.
Two sites which do not seem so 
desirable from tho standpoint of con
venience aro one, tlio ground now oc
cupied by tho Open Air Theater, and 
tho othor tho slto of tho Library hut. 
The former Is Illogical, as It would 
prevent addition to tlio building of 
tho Colllogo of FIno Arts should such 
additions bo contemplated, and at 
tiho samo tiino It is inconvonlont to 
the presont athllotlc field, us is also

cause of tho Tact that tlioy would

Novembor 19 closod tlio most 
successful season of football Carne
gie Tech has ovor known. Succosh 
was not duo to tho playing of any 
one Individual, but to the combined 
efforts and lighting spirit of every 
man on our football squad. Spirit 
alone will not win football games 
we must have men first of all. We 
were very fortunate this year in 
having back with us fourteen letter 
men .who have workedunder Coach 
Steffen one or more years; this, to
gether with the brilliant new talent 
that entered Tech this fall nas 
given to us a team that will go down 
in Tech football history. #
This year we have clearly demon
strated to the public that we can 
be no longer called Class B, but 
must be ranked Claps A, standing 
out with the best in the country 
Coach Steffen was more than pleased 
with the season ju&t closed as it 
was the first time in his seven 
years at Tech that he had such a 
grand array of substitutes, to choose 
from, which goes to show that every 
man was out there working for all 
that was in him and too much

Athletics, as every one knows, aro 
the life, tho spirit and one might 
say, almost tho soul of the Ameri
can college. They constitute the 
chief activity throughout tho year, 
and are s fast. bocoming compulsory 
throughout tho schools of tho coun
try.
Athletics, in ono rorin or another, 
work to tho advantage of both tho 
participant and the college ho rep
resents. They not only provide Tull 
play for brain and muscle, but aro 
invaluable as ameans of recreation 
and as a dovolopor of spirit, tradi
tion and closer understanding be
tween great institutions of learning 
that otherwise would have littlo or 
no Intercourse.
A collogo without athletics would

It, "doddering old jnon, at tho qml

Last, but not least:, athletic aro a 
wonderful medium of advertising.

It Is not too much to say that in

REV. M. CAMPBELL
AT V" CHAPEL
Rev. M. Campbell, pastor of tha 
First Baptist Church, will be the 
speaker at the next Y. M. C. A. 
chapel meeting to be held in the 
Arts Theater as usual on Monday, 
December 5, at 12:50 p. m.
The Y. M. C. A. is co-operating 
with the Y. W. C. A. in their ef
forts to obtain Jane Adams as 
speaker for the chapel meeting of 
December 12. This will be the last 
chapel of the year and it is felt 
that Miss Adams is one of the most 
prominent women in the United 
States in social service work and 
would be^ a very appropriate speak
er on that occasion. Every effort 
Is being made to bring her here on 
that day.
As one looks backward, over tho 
football season, just completed, he 
cannot help but feel very much elat
ed The season was a most pronounc
ed success, and will go down in his
tory as the most successful of all Car
negie Tech football campaigns.' In 
games won and lost, there was no 
difference ovor many other seasons, 
for two games were lost, and seven 
won. There have been many seasons 
in tlie past in which tho same per-' 
centage was attained.
But never in the-history of Tech's 
football has there boon a season dur. 
ing which teams defeated were over
whelmed with such groat ease as was 
tho caso during the past season. 
There woro Uliiroe games in which the 
score was 42-0, whllo in one gamo 
the points mounted to 56-0. Only 
throe" teams scored against us, and 
when it is considered the record 
these throe teams made for thonisolvbs during tho season, no excuses 
are forthcoming; rather it might ho 
to our distinct credit that they woro 
not permitted to score moro than 
they did.
A crodltahlo review of the team 
might bo taken from any doslrod 
angle and In oach and overy caso 
only good can be found. Tho team 
performed throughout the season in a 
most wonderful manner, ever outstriding tho most sanguine hopes of 
her followers. Tho team did not play 
to victories bocauso of tho exception

but bocauso tlio men played to

It did, at tho very first ol! tho soar

hardest games, because at that; tlmo

Tho Penn State, Washington Hr.

Of course the final game with the

game, tflo, but Tech rose to hor 
greatest heights, and completely 
routod their Southern opponents with 
a terrific attack that was not to bo 
donlod.

CONGRATULATES TEAM
Football at tho Carnoglo Institute of Technology during the past 
season was a stimulating and Inspiring experience for us all. Tho 
team was so responsive to the best Ideals of sportsmanship, and made 
such a remarkable record that they havo earned a placo and fame as 
the best team the Institution has ever produced. Tlioy gained public 
confidence and friends among tho collogo mon of tho community.
This record has boon built on tho sound performance and splendid 
traditions of the teams_ which preceded them, and Coach Steffen 
ought to he proud to havo been the teacher who has contributed the 
most in this achievement. Whenever good results aro-obtained by 
constant and well-sustained effort, it establishes a standard which 
will undoubtedly bring about evon more brilliant attainments In tho 
future.
The team of 1921 has, by its success, brought immeasurably near
er, the hope that we may bring to realization at an earlier date than 
would otherwise have been possible, an enlarged athletic field and 
stadium.
I voice the congratulations and esteem of my colleagues.

TO THE FOOTBALL MEN
Although the football season is over and the winter sports are 
now the attractions, the Tartan turns back to pay homage to the war
riors oJ! Carnegie Techs gridiron. ,
To those follows who so ably represented Carnegie lech in the 
greatest oJ: inter-collegiate sports, and their coaches we wish to ex
tend our congratulations. Although two games were lost the show
ing oil the team wus far better than was expected and every llaid 
follower is more than proud of his football team.
We. hope that every one of the football men will be back to work 
with AValley Steffen, because we see great things ahead of next years 
team. The student body will be ready to back the team 011 the field 
and off. Together, Carnegie Tech should have, next year, a football 
team ranking with the foremost of the country.
THE BAND
Rain, shine, warm or freezing, the great Tech Band was out to 
represent and encourage the true Tech spirit at every giime during 
tho great football season just completed. To be better, bigger, more 
influential "toward the success of the season, and untiring in its effort 
to do all that could be desired in a collogo activity, was the hope and 
accomplishment of that organization. Few of the student body rea
lize what it meant to. the fey men to spend two or more hours two 
evenings every week at hard practice, when studies piled higher 
and higher, and dates and entortainmcnts had to be forgotten, that 
tho band might be able to represent fitly the kind oL! activity which 
Tech puts into the field. IP.Cw realize what it meant to bo week alter 
week spending a whole afternoon in the cold wind and rain, as they 
did at nearly every game; or to march three miles at dog trot, grab a 
cold lunch, and then while in the midst oJ! a freezing snowstorm, give 
cheer and confidence to our rooters and compete favorably with a 
band ol! more than twice its size, as was tho .circumstance at State. 
^ _ ho band fe]t that it had a big responsibility to J'uliill, one which 
was worlife while making any effort for. It showed that it could be 
depended upon to do what was expocted of it, and thus on its merits 
it has won tlio admiration ol! those t have heard and seen it.CONTRIBUTED.

COMMENTS
ACTIVITIES VERSU8 8TUDIE8
There havo boon many arguments 
over the effect of ntudent activities 
upon achool work. Since it in custo
mary to lay Uluo blame for any condi
tion upon any other causes than tho 
true ono. provided that true cause Is 
a pet of tho Investigator, professors 
havo been in tho habit of laying moBt 
of tho blame for neglect of studies 
upon extracurricular activities, main
taining that men who indulge in stu
dent .activities are Interested primar
ily In thoflo and thus lose much time, 
to tho detriment of other work, A 
professor at Columbia, tired of judg
ing upon moro guesses, recently took 
It upon himself to examine six hun
dred typicuJl cases'^to boo how muCh 
truth there is in this charge. Tho 
Columbia Spectator reports thus on 
tho results:
'There noed he no moro discussion 
anont the activities versus student 
controversy. It is a purely mythical 
strife, if wo accept the conclusion of 
Dean I-Iawkes made public at yester
days assembly. My investigation of 
more than six hundred typical cases, 
reports Professor I-Iawkes, 'shows tliat 
tho man engaged In extracurricular 
activities lias a better scholastic aver
age than the man who devotes Ills 
time solely to his studies.'
"For some time past many young 
authors who take a particular delight 
in advising college students through 
the medium of tho popular novel, 
have solemnly recounted ta/les of how 
classroom, studios aro sacrificed for 
gridiron or journalistic activities. 
Main street, of course, lias swallowed 
this thumbnail philosophy with its 
usual voracity.
"Knowing lull well that the dean 
hias tabulated his statistics carefully, 
it would bo to his advantage and to 
the advantage of students in general, 
were he to give his momentous fig
ures still further publicity. At any 
rate, he can pride himself in having 
thoroughly settled a venerable edu
cational issue.Daily Texan.

1 Happenings on ttie Campus
SELF-CONFIDENCE
Most of us know men who succeed 
in a big way, and yet who really ex
hibit only an average amount of 
sense 'and ability. If we analyze 
their success wo shnJU generally find 
that they are conspicuous above other 
men, ovon above those of greater 
acumon and ability, in ono striking 
particular(iliey havo ^ confidence in 
thomselyes.
It Is true that such men sometimes 
falU to accomplish what they set out 
to do, hut In tho main they succeed, 
and their successes aro tho only 
things they permit their minds to 
dwell upon. Whllo tho timorous man 
knowingly wags his lioad and dochlos 
that ho cannot accomplish this or 
that  for tho bears will surely got 
himtho self-conflddnt man is busy 
listing the things ho can do, and ar
ranging to carry out tJlio program.
Wo are reminded by these thoughts 
or a story handed down from the old 
days in tho grout Soutlnvost. Some 
docades ago there was a riot in a 
little Texas town. Tho sheriff sent 
an S. O. S. call to tho governor to 
solid him a, troop of the Texas
Rangers. The governor wired back,
"Rangers on route. Tho sheriff
anxiously met. the train. Ono lonely
Ranger got off. The sheriff llhrew 
up his hands In despair. Oh, my 
^ord, wheres tlio rest of your out
fit?" ho cried.
Rost, hell, replied tlio Ranger, 
as he nonchalantly took a chow of 
tobacco you aint got but ono riot, 
here, have you?"Ex.
Last Saturday I walked up tlio 
campus. I did not mind 'cause I 
had no date. But same how I was 
lonesome, for there was no football 
game. Sb I Btrollcd onto tho field, 
/anyhow, and sat down. First I saw 
the crowdB begin to gather. And 
everyone seemed to say, "I -yonder 
if TeCli can stand tho gaff today. It 
is time for their luck to break. For 
a moment I was skeptical Until I 
heard a hand. And then m7 spirits 
rose. It was Techs own band play
ing the old familiar tune. They were 
dressed in kilties, which reminded me 
that wo had tho most distinctive ag
gregation in the country. They 
marched around. One hundred strong. 
And everyone cheered. Because they 
knew that the day would not be com
plete without them.
Then the cheer leaders came out. 
All dressed in white After which a 
mighty roar welcomed the visitors. 
As they came down the gym steps. 
Dressed in orange and black. And T 
remembered wo wore playing. Prince
ton that day. They looied big and 
strong. With a couple of fast men In 
the backfiold. When all of a sudden 
one of them put over. A fifty yard 
drop kick. Just like rollin off a log. 
And I said a lil prayer 'cause I knew 
Tech must fight hard to win.
Then came a terrible roar as Tech 
came out. They did not make a big 
fuss. But there was the methodical 
thump of heavy shoos with each 
"Shift! Shift! Tho old familiar and 
snappy bark of the quarterback, "47- 
1-82 B J X. Everyone moves in uni
son and then I know. Some Prince 
ton man is going to eat dry bread 
for a week.
The game started and see-sawed 
back and forth for three quarters. 
While the stands Implore for a 
"Touchdown Tech. Then Wally 
sends in a man. Who never -wears a 
headgear. And on the flrbt play he 
runs across the goal line. While bats 
go up in the air. While the boys for
got themselves huggin' their sweeties, 
since Tech. lias accomplished the 
seemin impossible. With two minutes 
to go. Princeton is marching toward 
the goal line. When the final whistle 
blows.
I turned around cause someone is 
siiakin my seat. While a low down 
Plebe whistles at mo with a "Hey, 
you dumib bell, gonna sit there all 
winter. We want to get these bleach
ers away."
I was mad1, because I had been 60 
rudely. Awakened. But I was happy 
when I tliot of how in a few years. I 
would come back with a. Life-time 
date and see it all happen In real
ity.
Horse-shoe pitching is one of the 
new sports at Iowa State College. A

In Cornell they have the competi

sport manager wear black cloth' caps 
with red bands, bearing also the 
first letter of the sport for which 
they are competing. This has been 
adopted as a means of showing the 
college what men are interested in

TEKNON MEETING
According to a recent ruling made 
by the college authorities at the Uni
versity of Toledo, absence excuses 
of students must be signed by the 
parents1 or guardian of the student 
concerned. The Teaser, the official 
newspaper of the institution, made 
the following comment on the rul
ing: "Imagine a Senior chasing
home with his absence excuse wait 
ing for fond parents to sign 'name.''
Yassar College is democracy per

student is allowed to have an auto

All rooms in I he dormitories are the 
same price. If you were to visit

difference in dress between the 
daughter of a millionaire and the

Student loans at the University of 
Oregon may be limited in the future 
to non-smokers, according to the 
trustees of 'the loan fund. "The 
amount of money spent for tobacco 
by the average smoker is $50.00 or 
more during the school year, says 
Dean Straub of the school, "and at 
is felt that if a student really needs 
help he should eliminate this item 
of expense.
At the meeting of the Teknon 
Club Thursday night, November 17, 
Mr. Hartman, who is president of 
the Pitkin Club of Pitt, was a guest. 
He gave a short talk in which he 
expressed the hope of better rela
tions being established between Pitt 
and Tech. As a means to that end 
'he suggested a combined meeting 
of the Teknon and Pitkin Clubs to 
be held sometime in the near fu
ture. Mr. Hartman complimented 
the Teknon Club on the work they 
were doing and expressed the idea 
that the two clubs would be able to 
accomplish much moro if , they were 
connected more closely.
The Pitkin Club is analogus to 
the Teknon Club and is doing very 
fine work at Pitt. It is reported that 
a similar club is being organized 
at the Pennsylvania College for 
Women.

RIFLE CLUB COMPETITION
Much enthusiasm is being shown 
over the contest now going' on at 
the rifle range. There should be 
lots of good team material among 
those who have come up to the 
range. If you have not entered the 
contest yet, do so tomorrow after 
4:30. This is not a match between 
expert rifle shooters, so, if you have 
felt that you would not have a 
chance, forget it'and come up to the 
range to enter into the competition. 
The range is bn the top floor of the 
Arts Building over the P. & I. De
partment.
The Teknon Club will hold its reg
ular meeting tomorrow evening at 
6:00 oclock. The members of this 
club will remember that they have 
been picked from the student body 
to help carry on the more religious 
aspects of college life. If any mem
ber finds it impossible to attend a 
meeting, he is to see the President 
or some member of the Executive 
Committee so that the proper prepa
rations can be made.
The membership has been filled up 
to its maximum memberforty. If 
each one of those forty pull together 
and it has . already started to pull 
togetherwe will have a club of 
which every live member will be 
proud of owning as his club. ' Lets

recting for performance tonight and 
the rest of the week, with matinee 
Friday afternoon. The play itself 
caused quite a sensation wihen it was 
done by the Irish Players in New 
York a few years ago, and it will no 
doubt be equally interesting in this 
case. Nothing has been cut from the 
original text, in which there is really 
nothing objectionable. The cast in 
this Instance is practically all Irish, 
and -while that may not in any way 
add to the effectiveness of the per
formance, it is an interesting fact 
that, the Irish spirit and humor is 
caught and held throughout the play.
Anyone who remembers Mr. Oshovnos direction of "The Well of tlio 
Saints" two years ngo, will bo con
vinced that this play, with tho same 
careful, almost, inspired hnndling of 
difficult paasagos of crowd movement 
and buslnosa, cannot help hut be a 
huge onceoaa. Tho pormnnont sot

performance Is wonderfully atnioaphorle, and will add another triumph

DO YOU KNOW THE LARGEST ELEVATOR INSTALLATION IN THEJORLD?
The efficiency achieved at the huge 
United States Army Supply Base in 
Brooklyn, N. Y., is largely attributa
ble to the use of Otis Push Button 
Control Self-Leveling Elevators  in 
conjunction with tractor trains.
This.is the largest elevator installa
tion in the world, consisting of ninetysix elevators, ninety of which are 10,- 
000 pounds capacity Otis Freight Ele
vators of the self-leveling automatic 
type.
The elevators in the warehouses 
are operated in banks of ten and 
seven, by means of simple dispatch 
boards, so that one dispatcher oper
ates an entire bank of elevators. No 
operators are needed on the elevators 
themselves.
Due to the elimination of operators 
salaries alone, this Otis installation 
saves about $160,000 a year in operat
ing expense. *
The same efficiency and proportion
ate savings will be obtained through 
the use of Otis Push Button Auto
matic elevators in any' industrial 
building of two or more floors.

SENIOR TEA
Last Tuesday evening a joint meet
ing of' alii four Senior classes was 
held on the Recreation Hall of Mar
garet Morrison. A short business 
meeting preceded the dancing which 
was indulged in until lights out. Pep
py music, "lionest-to-goodness punch, 
and cut-in dances provided an evening 
which all considered well spent. If 
any of you Senior stay-at-homes are 
bashful, get over it and put on that 
clean collar and step out. The spirit 
of friendship which permeates die 
atmosphere at these affairs is highly 
commendable as well as pleasing and 
when the girds are willing enough to 
come out and dance it is up to the 
men to come, one and all, and help 
boost the Senior class at Tech.
SCIENCE SOPH MEETING
The Sophomores of Science held 
a class meeting last week after as
sembly. It was a very enthusiastic 
meeting for the chief subject of dis* 
cussion was the Soph banquet. After 
the smoke of battle had cleared 
away it was decided that a com
mittee should be appointed to look 
into the advisability or inadvisabil
ity of having a three school ban
quet and to report their recommen
dations about Decomber 6 or 7. It 
was also decided that the class dues 
for tho present quarter be collected 
in a lump sum.

seems rather early to be discussing 
it. It was suggested that it be held

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1921THE TARTANPAGE THREE
RESERVES HAD 
COOD SEASON
Played Seven Games  Met 
Some Strong Teams
The Reserves have finished a sea
son of a varying amount of success. 
During the season of seven games, 
only two games were won and one 
was tied. This is, however, no sign 
of a weak team when its schedule is 
taken into consideration and its 
method of getting men out for the 
team. The first game was lost to the 
Kiski Reserves 20-7. This team is 
the strongest Reserve aggregation of 
any Prep School in the country. The 
next two games were won, Butler 
High 27-0, and Westinghouse Tech 
61-0, the latter being the only home 
game for the Skibos. The week after 
this contest the Reserves traveled 
to Bellefonte Academy and held that 
eleven to a scoreless tie, which was 
very creditable considering that 
Bellefonte looms up as one of the 
strongest Prep Schools in this sec
tion. The remaining three games 
were lost to Rochester High) 13-7, 
Slippery Rock Normal 13-0 and to 
Waynesburg College 13-0, all topnotchers in the Prep and High School 
class. One notable fact stands out 
above the rest and that was: The 
team was not scored on once dur
ing the second half of any game.
An explanation of the management 
and handling of our Reserves team 
will enlighten us, some, to the diffi
culties in getting one representative 
team to play the entire schedule. Out 
of the 60 men reporting at the begin
ning of the season about 25 turned 
out each night and of this 25 only 
about half appeared on two consecu
tive , nights. Imagine then, the diffi
culties of Coach Parks, who, after 
drilling and instructing several men, 
finds that these men are not at prac
tice the next night. He must start 
over again with some new men, and 
what happensthe same thing, these 
men do not show up the next night, 
but perhaps one of the men out. of 
the week before is back and must 
receive his instructions all over 
again. Ttye writer wondered, as per
haps many others do, what the cause 
for this apparent indifference was. 
The answer is simple, Student Sup
port. The team must play practical
ly all its games away from home be
cause of expenses. The players know
ing that they will not perform be
fore their fellow students do not take 
enough interest in turning out every 
night and working as hard as might 
be. Threy cannot be blamed much for 
that, as no team will do its work 
without the support of the student 
body.
Playing its schedule is not the most 
important work of the Reserve team, 
To develop material for the Varsity 
squad is perhaps its most important 
duty, and in connection with this, to 
furnish practice scrimmage for Squad
B. In this the Reserves did veiy 
well.
Taking these facts into considera
tion, the, Reserves have had a very 
successful season.
A summary of the games played 
witln respective scores appeared be
low:
Kiski Reserves ...............20 T. R. 7
Butler High ..................... 0 T. R. 27
Westinghoilse Tech ......... 0 T. R. 61

TECH RUNNERS GREAT RECORD
(Continued From Page One.) 
with a triangular meet against Al
legheny and West Virginia. The 
score was: Tech 22, Allegheny 41.
Virginia 57. The team then enter
ed the National Championships with 
Captain Miller and Dykeman unable 
to run due to injuries. Nevertheless 
the old fight was there and third 
honors went to the Plaid. Kelley, 
finishing in fourth place, proved 
himself a distance runner of' the 
highest caliber. ,
The second team also made 
good Record, finishing third in the 
A. M. A. Championships and beatin, 
the Homestead Steel Work in a dual 
meet. -Coach Thoma developed this 
second team with Che idea of keep
ing the men interested in the work 
and also to give them an opportunity 
to get experience for the varsity.
Much praise is due the coach fcr 
the way in which he put out a win
ning team. He was continually in 
personal touch with the men and 
always was careful of their physic
al condition. Although this is his 
first big experience in coaching, he 
has proven himself entirely capable. 
No doubt he is as good a can be 
found in this section.
CO-EDS PLAY 
BASKETBALL
Have Attractive ScheduleMiss Bowman to Coach
The most colorful party ever 
staged for a Pittsburgh debutant 
Ailsa Mellon's included  faded far 
into 'the insignificant when five Mar
garet Morrison girls made their de
but as members of the first girls' 
varsity basket ball team. Although 
they lost their only game to Geneva 
suffice it to say that the visitors 
heaved a mighty sigh of relief when 
the final whistle blew, for only then 
had they the game safely tucked away.
Undaunted by this the fair co-eds 
are starting out on a more strenuous 
season this year, and with a good 
number of the old varsity back, Tech 
will be represented by an aggregation 
fit to give any team in the country 
the battle of their lives. Add to this 
a few of Pitt's team taking work at 
Tech and eligible to play, and you 
have only to provide the score keeper 
with enough figures to give Techs 
total at each game.
Miss Bowman will act as coach and 
will undoubtedly live up to the stand
ards set up by other Tech coaches in 
the work of her department. Regular 
practice periods are to be allotted to 
the girls in the mens gym and with 
the full support of the athletic council, 
the administration and faculty the 
only thing needed to put through a 
successful season is the vigorous use 
of all three lungs by every student, 
men and women alike.
Rest assured that the girls will 
fight to the last minute and as for 
Lenglen stuffwell, this institution is 
of Scotch descent. To the girls, get 
out and try for the team, if you cant 
make it, do as the men will do 
support it.
An effort is being made to have the 
team play prelim to the men at Gen
eva February 18. The other games 
booked this far are: Westminster,
away, March 4; Beaver, at home, 
February 4, and Westminster, at 
home, pending.

man-power, 400,000,000 strong, also 
coal enough to last the world at

They wish to develop these things 
for the entire world, and thats why 
they have come to the conference. 
But they should be freed from the 
shackles by which they are held. 
However, they are to continue with 
their constructive program until they 
are successful. China is taking 
Christianity as a last and most 
promising great principle to fulfill 
their need. He asked that all pray 
for the success of the conference

them. The following year proved to 
be Techs best to that time, only 
one game being lost and tliat only 
alter a hard struggle to Pitt.
The season of 1917 was greatly 
upset by conditions created by the 
World War. Several games were 
cancelled and no true line could be 
gotten on the players. The follow
ing year the entire schedule was 
cancelled due to the same condi
tions!.
Nineteen-nineteen saw Tech re
sume where she left off In 16, and 
a fine - team bore her colors. The 
memorable battle with Pitt was one 
of the greatest, ever played on 
Forbes Field. A better fate than be
ing on the short end of a 17 to 7 
score, was deserved.
An even better team marked tne 
efforts of both coach and1 players in
1920. The outstanding feat being 
the defeat of W. & J., 6 to 0. Ath
letic relations with Pitt had been 
broken off and consequently no 
game was played.
The season of 21, still fresh in 
the minds of all, has been Coach 
Steffens and Carnegies most bril
liant and successful, a season that 
places Carnegie Tech once and for 
all on the football map of the coun
try^ May fortune smile upon her!
TRACK
Track has always been, as in most 
technical schools, successful as 
major sport.
The first team represented the 
Plaid in 1906, and in 1908, Tech 
won the Western Pennsylvania In
tercollegiate relay at the Penn re
lays. In  190D the relay feat was 
duplicated. Two years later the 
team started its annual annexation 
of the W. P. I. C. title, which it held 
in 1911-12-13. Good teams were 
turned out each., year^ and 1920 saw 
the most successful season in the 
schools history, every meet bein; 
won easily. IThe Ceam of '21 again 
annexed the coveted Tri-State title, 
and with a veteran squal on hand, 
hope is high for another great year.
The records rank well among the 
colleges of the country. Some of 
the best are Kellys 10 flat for the 
100-yard dash and Pittman's 22 feet 
7 inches in the broad jump. The 
time of 9:57 for the two-mile run 
is also exceptionally good. 
BASEBALL AND BASKET BALL
These two sports could aptly be 
termed hard-luck sisters, or broth
ers as the case may be. Since the 
time of their initial season at Tech, 
never has thero been what could 
really and honestly be called, a suc
cessful team. 
vThe best baseball team, in 1912, 
won two more games than it lost. 
In 1919 Hans Wagner took up the 
coaching burden but the ever-ready 
faculty ax fell not at all gently up
on tho team, ruining its prospects. 
In fact, these two sports are annu 
ally hit harder by ineligibility than 
any other. Better luck this year.
HOCKEY
This exciting sport was inaugu
rated at Tech in 190C and in 1909 
and 1910 the Tartan captured the 
W. P. I. C. Lack of a rink caused 
the abandonment of hockey on a col
legiate scale for several years.
In 1920 a team again represented 
Tech, with varying success. The 
status for this year is at present un
known.
On The Plaid Screen
BY H. F. SIMPSON
WALTER P. STEFFEN
As the football season goes into history, the great personality of our 
coach conies more and more into the front rank of the countrys football 
world. Wally Steffen lias been nt Tech for seven years now. and so far 
as we students are concerned, is a fixture. During that time lie has raised 
the football team from a low standard v to the present high. He lias suc
ceeded in making the team good enough to combat on equal terms with the 
best in the country. He has succeeded in instilling that spirit of fight and 
determination into his men that means victory, or. if defeated, a victory in 
defeat. He has done this because of his great hold on his men.
Every single man on the squad thinks most highly of Steffen, because 
he is a man among men. He is at once, friend, comrade, coach and adviser. 
He has never been known to discourage a man out for the team. He-has 
never been known to make an enemy on the squad. Every single man on 
the squad looks up to him with that devotion that only exists between men, 
for they have learned to know him as a friend who will always prove true: 
who will aid them in whatever way he can, and a man who knows football 
from the very ground up, and a man who has just that amount of sympathy 
and knowledge of world affairs as to be able to give good and sound advice.
As a football coach there is none better in the country, and Tech is most 
fortunate in that Steffen desires above all things to remain at Tech. Many 
schools and colleges throughout the country want him, but in his own words, 
he loves Carnegie Tech, and for that reason his one desire is to finish his 
coaching days where he first began.
ROBERT N. WADDELL 
ROBERT PARKS
The success of a football season hinges greatly upon tho type of men 
selected to direct the Freshman team, and upon the assistant coach. In 
"Bob Waddell and Parks, Tech had two very valuable additions to their 
football coaching staff.
Waddell was a most potent factor in the successful season just com
pleted, for Steffen used his keen ability to diagnose the tactics of our oppo
nents to good advantage. Waddell scouted our opponents, and in every case 
brought back to Steffen a full and accurate account of their style of play. 
During the week, lie gave these plays to the second team, who put them into 
play for the benefit of the varsity. Too much, therefore, cannot be said in 
favor of Waddell.
Waddell is a regular good scout, and is liked 'well by every member of 
the squad, on account of his good nature, natural ability and dovotion to the 
game as played at Tech. This column hopes he will be with us again next 
year.
Coach Parks did his work well. He took the green material and suc
ceeded in molding them into a good team. The handicaps were many, and 
for that reason Avhat success he did have is greatly to his credit. He brought 
out much latent ability, which it is predicted will greatly benefit the varsity 
next season.
CROSS-COUNTRY
The cross-country season just finished was the most successful in tho 
history of the sport here at Tech. In every meot witli colleges, Tech mon 
finished out in the front, which is deserving of praise wlion it is considered 
tho type of opposition faced. In Lafayette and Penn State, two of the 
strongest teams in the country were met. Cornell is tho only team that is 
placed above Tech, and had the two teams met, perhaps a different story 
would be told.
The schedule was hard, but not quite hard enough. Dual rnoets are all 
right, but not good enough. When the schodulo for next season is made 
out, it seems to this column that triangular or four-cornored moots should bo 
scheduled wiierever possible. Tho advantages are obviousit makes a pos
sibility of winning over a larger field, and at the same time lessons tho 
chances of a complete defeat. If Tech wins a triangular moot, they win ovor 
two teams, while on the othor hand, should tlioy fail to win, they at least 
have a chance to still defeat one of their opponents.
So, as a suggestion to tho schedulo makers, tho following combinations 
are given: Tecli-W. & J.-AUegheny-W. Vn.; Tech-Lohlgh-Lafayotto;. Tech*
Bucknell-Penn State; Tcch-Syrueuso-Cornoll; Toch-RutgorBGolumbla. Any 
of these combinations would make interesting hieets, whether run lioro oil 
the local course, or abroad.
A few words of praise and comment in regard to Coach Thomas would 
not be amiss at the present time. It seems that this much Is duo him, for 
when he took up tho coaching burdens, he found only on<! fully dovolopod 
cross-country manMiller. But, ho found a ready and willing group of men 
with the proper spirit and determination. Out of those, such mon as Kelly, 
Dykeman, Greenlaw, Tubbs, Mendenhall, Gottwalls, Cavot, MoKolvoy and 
Long were developed. Although this is Thomas's first experience as a 
coach, he proved that he can deliver tlio goods. His raising of Kelly from a 
new man, fresh from high school, to a position on a level with tho host In 
the country can bo ranked as a groat achievement in cross-country coaching 
this with duo rospoct to Kellys natural ability. The same might ho said 
in regard to the development of Dykeman, Groonlaw, and Cavot.
CONGRATULATIONS
Carnegie Tech takes this opportunity to extend congratulations to tho 
two schools in tho Western Pennsylvania district, OUR district., who had 
successesONE, for the season, and tho OTHER, for imishing in a blaze 
of glory.
Washington & Jefferson, we congratulate you, for your wonderful soaHon. 
PITT, we congratulate you too for your great showing and 'come-back 
against Penn State.
Tech is always glad to see a school in our district roach a high pinnacle 
of success. Maybe we are a little bit selfish in this, but who is not? Your 
success raises us a bit higher, for we remember our hard and thrilling game 
with you in Little Washington.
PITT, youre a Pittsburgh school, and ,our friendly rivalry wishes you 
success except when you play us. May luck attend you in all your games 
except against us. Thenwell, you know what we wish then!
A CRITICISM
Men of Carnegie Tech, there is too much of a tendency here at Tech to 
criticize existing conditions. Men are prone to speak without a thorough in
vestigation of the matter, and as a result often get their ideas somewhat 
twisted. Again there are many who by careless use of their tongues give 
out impressions that they themselves do not believe. This works to the 
disadvantage of yourself and to the school.
Three Football Captains
LEFTGODDEN, CAPT., '20 
RIGHTIRWIN, CAPT., 21
For the first time in its history, 
Tech lias three football captains in 
school at one time.
Red Godden, our flashy end, cap
tained tho 1920 team through a victo
rious year* the climax of which wras 
the Tech 6, W. & J. 0 game at tho 
end of the season last year. Godden, 
although lie played in tho backfiold 
last season, appeared this year at an 
end position, where his excellent work 
showed up to good advantage. Ho 
is a Senior in Industries, 21 years old 
and weighs 157 pounds. He is a 
member of the Dolta Epsilon Onioga 
fraternity.
Al Irwin, center and captain of this 
years team, also played his last 
game with the Skibos a week ago 
Saturday. Al has an envious record 
as a centor and cou'ld always bo de
pended upon to snap tho ball just 
right, no matter how muddy tho flold 
or liow adverse the conditions might 
bo. He came to Tech nftor a year at 
W. & .T., and finished his third sea
son on tho varsity olevon after tho 
Maryland game this yoar. It is go
ing to bo difficult to fill his posi
tion next yoar. He is a mombor of 
tho Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Jimmie Ahderson, captaln-oloct of 
tho 1922 team, has Just complotod his 
second successful soason as a half
back,. having made lifa lottor last 
year ins well as this yoar. Anderson 
won tho captaincy by dint of1 hanl 
work and by his oxcollent playing 
both yoars. No ono on tho squad had 
tho team and school moro at heart 
than "Andy." With, tho loss of only 
three of tills yoars men It Is hopod 
that Captaln-oloct AndorBon will havo 
the most successful soason of Tech's 
football history noxt year. Ho is a 
mombor of tho Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
fratornity.
Our athletic affairs are in the process of development, so mistakes are 
bound to be made. Nothing ever became perfect without many failures. 
This column admits the failures of the men in charge of our athleticsso do 
they. But they are doing more than wethey are doing their level best to 
correct them. Let us help them! If you want to criticize, go to the office of 
the graduate manager and do itdont get in your own gang and do it; 
thats doing it behind ones back. It doesnt do any good there, it only re
sults in good when done in the open.
To every question there are two sides. Both are not entirely wrong, 
nor are they both entirely right. The right is usually a combination of the 
two. So, this column is going to print both sides of the athletic question, 
and in that manner hopes to bring out the good in both, discarding the bad, 
and thereby make out of the two, one big; strong Tech athletic body.
TENNIS
This most strenuous sport seems 
to be one that attracts Techites. All 
tennis teams have , been at least fair
ly successful.
The team of 1914 made a splendid 
record while under the present cap
able coach, Colonel Brooks, the 
tams of 1919, 20 and 21 have been 
by far the best. The team of '20 
was one to make all Tech mon 
proud. It lost hut one match during 
the entire season, and that to Mich
igan, Conference Champion.
NEW SPORTS
Wrestling, boxing and swimming 
were only last year inaugurated and 
great possibilities are in Btore for 
each.
In closing, it is felt that a word 
must be given to Frank H. Haarun, 
who, since he took charge of ath
letics, in 1913, has always capably 
and conscientiously handled the man
agerial reins and done much to put 
Tech on the high plane she now oc
cupies.

WHEN you get out into the medical world, youll find 
young doctors are judged by something more than 
diagnostic ability and knowledge of their subject. The at
mosphere of success plays its partthe evidence that you 
have arrived. And among the little details that indicate 
success, theres the habit of preferring

City of New York, Columbia, and 
West Point. The gymnasium of the 
Madison Square Garden in New York 
and of Goodyear and Firestono Rub
ber companies in Akron, Ohio, were 
also inspected by him at this time.
Th&t the ailumni are vitally inter
ested in this project is shown by two 
plans drawn up and submitted by 
William H. King, Jr., a local archi
tect. One of these plans is repro
duced elsewhere in this issue, and 
shows the gym in conjunction with 
the hoped-for stadium located front
ing on Woodlawn avenue. The 
stadium as here planned, would seat 
twenty-two thousand people without 
balconies. Resorting to balconies, 
and counting-standing room also, the 
stadium could accommodate between 
fifty thousand and sixty thousand peo
ple. The main entrance to the stadium 
would be across from the gymnasium 
fronting on Forbes street, and ade
quate parking facilities ars provided 
for by opening up Forbes street as 
shown.
While all of these are merely plans 
and discussions, they, nevertheless, 
show that the thing which every un
dergraduate has hoped for tho last 
half-dozen years is iiually actually 
crystalizing into definite forms, and 
in the near future will be an actual 
reality.
Our representatives on the Gym
nasium Committee are Edna Smith, 
'0.9, and Helen Stewart, '11. This 
committee, appointed by the Federa
tion president, is working on the 
problems of location and activities for 
the new gymnasium, wfclcli is to be 
built soon.
ChrlBtma Party.
This event will ho held in the Rec
reation Hall Decemlber 15th. at eight 
oclock. It Js to bo a real merry 
Christmas party suchi as we enjoyed 
in days gone by. The students will 
rovive for our delectation the old 
Boar's Head Procession and the 
alumni will put on some vaudeville 
acta reminiscent of undergraduate 
days. There will be carol singing and 
music by the StrlngerB, also a Santa 
Claus and Christmas tree.
Do you think you can afford to 
miss it?
The only admission charged will be 
a small toy suitable for a sick child. 
These toys noed not cost more than 
ten cents or a quarter, but please do 
put a little thought into their selec
tion as they aro destined for the chil
drens ward in some lilospital. Come 
out and get some real Christmas 
spirit before the holidays. Call up 
your classmates and invite them. 
Some of them perhaps do not get the 
Tartan and will not know about it. 
The students are working hard to 
give us a pleasant evening. Lets 
show them a little appreciation. You 
will have such a good time that you 
will forget liow many years havo 
passed since you were one yourself.

MARGARET MORRISON ALUMNAE 
BAKE SALE
A GOOD TIME
If you would like togo to a good 
dance next Saturday or any Saturday 
night the Ata Zeta Club will entertain 
you at Ruddys, 4616 Forbes, just 
above Craig. They have a good fivepiece orchestra. Dont stay home be
cause you havent a girl.
We refer to the sale of haked goods 
which the Alumnae Association held 
in the Gainaday Electric display 
rooms in East Liberty last Saturday. 
It is an old story nowin more 
than one sense. But that, as Mr. 
Kipling would say, is another tale 
and will furnish copy for another 
issue.
The idea of holding the sale orig
inated with the Ways and Means 
Committee and the success of r.he 
venture proved its worth as a means 
of increasing our funds. Several 
times the amount of goods could 
have been disposed of and the head 
saleslady almost wept because she 
could not supply the demand. We 
were sold out by mid-afternon and 
so had to miss the regular Saturday 
night trade and the music of Its 
shekels clinking merrily in our cash 
box. Next time we will do better.
Much credit is due Miss Leech 
and her entire organization. Those 
who worked did yeoman service as 
usual. The class solicitors had es
pecially tedious work. In all about 
one hundred members contributed. 
Where were the other ninety, and 
nine? The publicity was exceeding
ly well handled by Lorna_ Williams, 
Mrs. Redenbaugh, Irma Friedman 
and their assistants. The newspa
pers treated us very generously and 
with street car posters, movie slides 
and special cards of announcement 
our fair name was .spread throughout 
the town. Never again can citizens 
of this community say they have 
not heard of Margaret Morrison.
The window display at the sales
room which proved such an attraction 
was arranged by Dorothy Skinner. 
Mention of the sales-room also
brings to mind the courteous treat
ment and kindly assistance of Mr. 
Craig and his staff to whom we are 
greatly indebted.
Among the girls who helped t.o
make it a success were Millicent 
Le6ch, Alberta Greene Redenbaugh. 
Florence Bechtel, Eliza Dickey Blair, 
Madeline Meese Rowley, Mary
Young, Mary Williams, Genevieve 
Cuslnva, Mildred Knapp, Fannie
Woodside, Lily Crosby Chalinor. 
Irene Quinn Harnack and Elizabeth 
Caulfield.
