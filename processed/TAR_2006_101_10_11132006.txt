Pennsylvania has been ranked the fifth most 
expensive state in which to attend public col
lege and the 10th most expensive state in 
which to attend private college, according to a 
November 6 issue of Time magazine.
The College Board compiled the rankings, 
which are based on the average tuition rates 
of public and private colleges and universities 
statewide.
Pennsylvania tuition rates at four-year pub
lic campuses moved from most expensive to 
number five, while tuition figures in the fouryear private sector fell from sixth to tenth.
According to the College Boards nation
al pricing report, tuition and fees paid by 
Pennsylvanians are about $9041 at public fouryear campuses and $25,591 at private fouryear campuses. As it is, these figures remain 
thousands of dollars over the national aver
ages  $5,836 and $22,281, respectively.
Tuition rates at both Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University of Pittsburgh 
exceed not only the national averages in their 
respective categories but those averages for 
Pennsylvania as well.
At the University of Pittsburgh, a public 
university, the typical in-state undergraduate 
tuition is approximately $12,000  more than 
double the national average and a full $3000 
above the Pennsylvania average.

High schoolers 
take on Siemens
Competition
Professor Alfred Blumstein, who teaches in the Heinz School, was 
awarded the Stockholm Prize in criminology last week.
Professor wins award 
for criminology work
by Justine Rae Lee
Staffwriter
Alfred Blumstein, a professor 
in the Heinz School of Public 
Policy and Management, was 
awarded this years Stockholm 
Prize in criminology last week.
The current director of the Na
tional Consortium on Violence 
Research, Blumstein won for his 
analyses of developmental and 
life-course criminology and for 
his influence on public policy in 
criminal justice over the past 40 
years. He shares the prize with 
Terrie E. Moffitt of Kings Col
lege, London.
Blumstein is a former dean of 
the Heinz School and the J. Erik 
Jonsson university professor of 
urban systems and operations re
search. He holds a bachelors de
gree in engineering physics and 
a Ph.D. in operations research 
from Cornell University. He was 
first exposed to criminology in 
1966 when he was recruited to 
lead a task force on science and 
technology for President Lyndon 
Johnsons Crime Commission.
They came to feel that sci
ence and technology were get
ting a man to the moon  so 
it certainly ought to be able to 
solve the urban crime problem, 
Blumstein said.
After he was introduced to 
the field, he submitted a few 
papers using his background in
engineering and operations re
search for perspective on crimi
nology, but found the field tough 
to crack.
My first few papers were 
turned down by criminology 
journals, Blumstein said. So 
its really very satisfying to be 
accepted as a significant player 
in that field.
In 1969, Blumstein was hired 
as a faculty member by Brian 
Cooper, the dean of Carnegie 
Mellons School of Urban and 
Public Affairs (SUPA), now the 
Heinz School.
It sounded like an exciting 
opportunity partly because the 
kind of work that I did, which 
was somewhat technical, would 
be much more appreciated in a 
techy place like Carnegie Mel
lon, Blumstein said. And that I 
could interact with people with 
analytic orientations.
Blumstein went on to become 
the dean of SUPA, renamed the 
Heinz School in 1992, for seven 
and a half years (1986-1993). 
In that time, he became a men
tor to many, including the Ph.D. 
advispr to Daniel Nagin, now 
the Teresa and H. John Heinz 
III professor of public policy and 
statistics.
Now considered his colleague 
in the field of criminology, Nagin 
wrote Blumsteins nomination 
letter for the Stockholm Prize.

Smart People on campus
Movie set at Carnegie Mellon in second week of filming
by Andrew Peters
Assistant Personnel Manager 
& Laura Thoren
Staffwriter
From the writer to the director to the extras, ev
erything about Carnegie Mellons lastest stint in 
the spotlight is smart.
The movie Smart People will be filmed entirely 
on location at Carnegie Mellon and around Pitts
burgh. Filming started on November 6 in Baker 
Hall. Other filming locations on campus include 
Hamburg Hall, Doherty Hall, Donner House, and 
Skibo Gym.
While the bulk of filming will end this Wednes
day, the production team will return in December 
to finish shooting the film.
The movie will also feature university staff and 
students in small roles and as extras, interns, and 
production assistants.
By having this movie feature the university 
prominently, were building national awareness 
for Carnegie Mellon, said Marilyn Kail, assistarit 
vice-president of marketing communications, in a 
Carnegie Mellon press release.
Smart People, written by Mark Poirier, chronicles the relationship between widowed English 
professor Lawrence Wetherhold, played by Dennis 
Quaid, and Wetherholds son and daughter, played 
by Ashton Holmes and Ellen Page.
According to Poirier, Wetherholds children are 
faculty brats, forced by their father to attend 
Carnegie Mellon for the free tuition. Wetherhold 
ends up falling for a former student, played by 
Sarah Jessica Parker. The film also features Thomas 
Hayden Church as Quaids brother-in-law.
Unlike the last movie filmed here, Wonder Boys, 
Smart People will refer to Carnegie Mellon by 
name.
According to Poirier, the screenplay is based 
on his own experience as the son of a professor at 
the University of Arizona. He later transferred to 
t Georgetown University to major in writing and ini
tially wanted to film in Washington, D.C., but direc
tor Noam Murro decided he preferred the look and 
feel of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon.
We wanted a selective university, but the build
ings here arent generic academic buildings, Murro 
said, singling out Wean Hall as disgusting, but its 
beautiful in its own way.

together to showcase projects 
based on months of original, 
graduate-level research.
Theyre also vying for a 
spot in the national finals, 
the winner of which receives 
$100,000.
This weekend, five individu

chosen as Mid-Atlantic regional 
finalists out of a pool of 300 
semifinalists.
The intricacies of their proj

The competition, now in its 
eighth year, is sponsored by the 
Siemens Foundation, an orga

high school programs in math 
and science. The competition 
operates in conjunction with 
the Educational Testing Ser

26 teams and 30 individuals 
who become regional finalists 
out of an applicant pool of 600 
students.
Theyve sought out Carn

fellSmartP
/ BrBradford Yankiver
The first-years who enrolled this 
fall came to Carnegie Mellon paying 
$44,048 in tuition, room and board, 
and other various fees. Thats 8 percent 
more than the class of 2009 paid a year 
earlier, and about twice what students 
paid in fall 2000.
Carnegie Mellon and other top uni
versities are stuck in a cycle of set
ting tuition rates, trying hard to avoid 
appearing too expensive, and trying 
harder to avoid appearing too cheap.
As a result of this competition, the 
cost of a college education is soaring, 
and thats especially true at Carnegie 
Mellon. The trustees and administra
tors charged with setting tuition rates 
have been deliberate in their strategy 
of catching up and keeping pace with 
the tuition rates of top-tier universities.
Every semester, Carnegie Mellon 
loses students as a result of the finan
cial burden  Im sure many more dont 
bother applying. Others work hour af
ter hour to make ends meet, struggling 
along the way to keep their grades up 
to snuff. 
One student wrote to me recently, I 
barely made it back to school this year 
because I could not make my tuition.... 
Working three jobs to make tuition is 
very hard, as it significantly impacts my 
performance in school. I register for my 
classes late every semester because I 
have a hard time making payments.
Still others let the loans pile up as 
they kiss goodbye to the ability to have 
free choice of what they do when they 
graduate.
One friend told me, I only hope that 
it will not affect me to the degree that 
I have to forego a position that I would 
really love for one that pays more so 
that I can pay off loans.
Another said that she wouldnt have 
the option of attending graduate school 
because of the loans shed accrued.
As Ive written before, I have confi
dence in Carnegie Mellons administra
tors our university is world-renowned 
for its ability to create and implement 
strategic plans  and I wont say I have 
an exceptional understanding of tuition 
pricing. But the tuition game feels like 
it is out of control, and students are tak
ing a beating as a result.
At Carnegie Mellon, students usually 
get a lot of chances to offer their input. 
But tuition is one issue on which stu
dents have not been able to offer their 
input in any meaningful way.
Each fall as administrators plan the 
following years tuition, vice-president 
for enrollment Bill Elliott e-mails a 
handful of students, inviting them to be 
a member of the Undergraduate Tuition 
Committee. In the past, that meant 
that those few students would attend 
a fancy dinner in the University Center 
with faculty, trustees, and parents of 
currently enrolled students listening 
to the administrators present reports 
about how Carnegie Mellon is spending 
money and how the university has fared 
in the rankings. Then theres time for 
dinner and discussion.
I was honored that Elliott invited me 
to last years Undergraduate Tuition 
Committee, but by the end of the meet
ing I was frustrated and bitter. While 
the e-mail I received read, We need 
your help in formulating this recom
mendation [to the trustees on the 2006- 
2007 tuition], I left the meeting feeling 
like it had been more like a pep rally 
than a focus group, like it was just a 
way to be able to say that students and 
parents were part of the process.
Somewhat to my surprise, I received 
an invitation to this years meeting too. 
The e-mail was nearly identical to last 
years  essentially a copy-paste job 
with a new date.
Heres to hoping that the meeting 
itself will have changed a little more 
than the e-mail did.

without having to pay the bond 
and are required to reappear at 
their future court date.
According to Caroline Roberto, 
Pauls attorney, the charges 
against Durvasula and Paul 
remain. Durvasula has been 
charged with criminal conspir
acy, and Paul has been charged 
with criminal trespassing.
All of law enforcement agreed 
this was a simple trespass and not 
what they thought it was Sunday 
morning, Roberto said.
Bill Ward, Durvasulas attor
ney, declined to comment on the 
pending case.
Paul is a member of the Un
dergraduate Finance Associa
tion. The clubs president, Ramzi 
Ramsey, a senior in business ad
ministration, stated in an e-mail 
that Paul is glad to be back to 
school and that his main worry is 
catching up on the schoolwork he 
missed last week.
Although the police response 
was a bit heavy, it is to be ex
pected in times like this, Ramsey 
stated.
Durvasula is a member of the 
Undergraduate Entrepreneurship 
Association and the chairman of 
the Tepper Venture Challenge.
Both students are members of 
Carnegie Mellon University Mock 
Trial.
Neither student was available 
for comment.
According to the Post-Gazette 
article, the mens attorneys pre
sented the judge with letters 
from the university stating that 
they were both welcome back as
students in good standing.
While it is my prerogative 
to review cases in which stu
dents have been convicted in 
the public courts of certain seri
ous crimes, this matter does not 
warrant any judicial review at 
this time, stated Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Jennifer Church in 
an e-mail, referring to disciplin
ary activity on the unversitys 
part.
Church stated that she was 
relieved to learn that Durvasula 
and Paul would be able to re
sume their studies.
I trust that they have found 
the Carnegie Mellon community 
to be helpful to them during this 
time, Church stated.
Both students are required to 
appear at a preliminary hearing 
on November 29.

Our Young Black Men Are Dying, and No One Seems to Care
James Chapmyn, writer of Our Young Black Men Are Dying, and No One Seems to Care, spoke at the show of 
the same name last night in Rangos Ballroom.
Pa. tuition within top 10 highest in U.S.
TUITION, from Al
Carnegie Mellons tuition 
deviated Similarly from the aver
age. Tuition for the 2006-07 aca
demic year totals about $34,000 
 nearly $11,000 above the 
national average and $8000 
above the Pennsylvania average.
This is a very expensive busi
ness, said vice-president of 
enrollment Bill Elliott. How do 
you maintain and improve while 
at the same time trying to main
tain costs?
Over the past year, the aver
age tuitions of both four-year 
public and four-year private uni
versities have increased by 6 per
cent nationwide. This percent
increase is equivalent to $344 at 
public universities and $1238 at 
private universities. Over the past 
five years, overall tution costs of 
both private and public universi
ties have risen 35 percent.
In addition to administrators, 
students are trying to rationalize 
the high costs of tuition.
I feel like tuition is so expen
sive because it isnt being used 
correctly, said H&SS first-year 
Barbara Matthews. It should be 
used on things we really need. 
Maybe its just a byproduct 
of an increased cost for stan
dard of living ... everything from 
health insurance to food servic
es, said H&SS first-year JoAnna 
Hartzmark.
At a news conference in
Washington, D.C., the College 
Board reported that, even though 
tuition increases this fall have 
slowed for the third consecutive 
year, college costs continue to* 
outpace inflation.
A similar story can be seen 
when college costs are compared 
to the cost of living. According 
to a March 17 Time magazine 
article', the increase in college 
tuition from 1977 to 1997 was

Campus News in Brief
Cell phone tower on Warner
by Patrick Pettibon
Staffwriter
Cingular Wireless in
stalled a new cell phone 
tower on the roof of War
ner Hall three weeks ago.
Telecom, a division of 
Carnegie Mellons Net
work Services Depart
ment, has worked on a 
project to increase cell 
phone reception across 
campus for the past de
cade, stated Chuck Bartel, 
the director of network 
services for the Division 
of Computing Services, in 
an e-mail.
Bell Atlantic Mobile 
placed the universitys 
first cell phone tower 
on top of Wean Hall in 
the mid-1990s and paid 
$1000 per month, accord
ing to Bartel.
The major cell phone 
carriers, which now in
clude Cingular, Verizon 
Wireless, Sprint, and TMobile, each pay monthly 
leases between $1000 and 
$2000 to place their tow
ers on the roof of Warner 
Hall.
According to Bartel, 
that money is used to im
prove cellular reception 
all across campus by al
lowing the installation of 
vendor neutral systems 
in areas where coverage is 
poor, such as in the base
ment of the University 
Center.
We recognized early 
on the potential needs for 
a mobile campus commu
nity, Bartel stated.
Telecom is responsible 
for the voicemail system, 
cable TV, and long dis
tance and local phone ser
vice on campus.
Telecom is working to 
improve campus televi
sion service for students 
by bringing new stations 
to dorm rooms, stated 
Kevin Deak, assistant 
manager of Telecom.
Citizens near campus 
areas also benefit from 
the towers, Bartel wrote, 
because any customers of 
the carriers now get bet
ter reception.
Network services and 
Telecom plan to spend all 
of the revenue from the 
tower leases to improve 
existing infrastructure on 
campus to get signals in 
places on campus where 
students, faculty, and 
staff still cannot make or 
receive calls. Bartel said 
there is no financial im
pact on students or the 
campus community.

MOVIE, from Al

and Murros constant joking has 
made the filming process very en
tertaining.
He has a great aesthetic eye, 
and he is very decisive, McCurdy 
said, praising Murros work over 
the past few weeks.
According to McCurdy, this de
cisiveness has extended to cast
ing extras. While many directors 
have their assistant choose extras, 
Murro selected many of the extras 
himself.
Noam looked at [the picture 
of] every extra, McCurdy said. 
She added that before filming, she 
and Murro were scouting one of 
Carnegie Mellons dorms for ex
tras when they encountered one 
student with hair like a modern 
sculpture.
Murro immediately said I want 
him, and walked away.
We love the people, love the
school, love the atmosphere, 
Murro said, after quipping sarcas
tically that filming the movie had 
been the worst experience and 
that he enjoyed being at Carnegie 
Mellon because he loved New 
York.
Although this is his first film, 
Poirier has taught writing at a 
number of universities, including 
Johns Hopkins and Stanford.

can Dreamz, a satire of American 
Idol, while Parker, the star of Sex 
and the City, has recently starred 
in Failure to Launch and The Fam

According to McCurdy, Carn
egie Mellon administrators have 
approached the films producers 
seeking a preview sceening for 
Carnegie Mellon students before 
the film is released. The films 
producers, however, have not yet 
replied to the administrations re
quest.

elusive gem.
In the early 1900s, several Japanese entre
preneurs figured out how to induce oysters to 
form pearls. The procedure, called nucleat
ing, involves planting both a piece of oyster 
tissue and a nucleus of a mollusk shell inside an 
oyster. From there, the process occurs just as it 
does in nature.
Nucleating revolutionized the pearl indus
try, transforming a commodity historically 
reserved for the rich and privileged into the 
hands of everyday consumers. Pearls may no 
longer occupy the forefront of the gem market, 
but their legacy will always serve as a reminder 
of their iridescent past.
Though the market for pearls is not what it 
used to be, the demand for gems and minerals 
as a whole is on the rise.
Its almost like a cult-group, said Robert Patak, owner of the Shadyside Mining Company. 
Patak has attended the Gem & Mineral Show 
every year since its debut.
You get a person who collects this stuff  
they become a junkie, basically, he said. They 
get addicted to minerals and rocks and beads 
and anything gemstone-related.
As addictions go, this ones expensive. Its 
nothing to pay five, 10 thousand dollars for a 
specimen anymore, said Patak. You could get 
the same specimen 10 years ago for $500. 
According to Patak, in recent years the Inter
net has spread the appeal of gems and minerals 
to a broader group of interest.
Its really a world market now, he explained.

were. Patak cited Germany and Russia as two

Diamonds might be a girls best friend  but 
pearls saw her first. Today, a 50-pearl necklace 
could cost anywhere from $500 to $5000, but 
throughout history, the value of the pearl has 
been immeasurable. Choosing pearls for its 
ninth annual theme, the Gem & Mineral Show, 
running from Friday through Sunday at the 
Carnegie Museum of Natural History is tap
ping into centuries worth of pursuit and fasci
nation.
Pearls have long been symbols of luxury and 
celebration. At the legendary Pearl Banquet 
in Egypt, Cleopatra is said to have crushed a 
pearl from a pair of earrings and drunk its dust 
mixed with vinegar in front of Marc Antony. 
Supposedly, such unconventional disregard for 
material wealth was enough to win the young 
Romans heart. Pliny the Elder, the original 
gemologist, recorded in Natural History that 
Cleopatras pearls were equivalent in value to 
approximately 1,875,000 ounces of silver (24 
million of todays U.S. dollars).
Pearls form naturally when a foreign object 
becomes lodged in the tissue of an oyster or 
other mollusk. A substance called nacre sur
rounds the irritant, forming in layers; this be
comes a pearl over time.
Nacre is made of calcium carbonate crystals, 
and mollusks also use it to prevent their shells 
from becoming rough.
Until the start of the 20th century, pearls 
were extremely difficult to harvest. Pearl hunt
ing was what it sounded like: Pursuers dived 
up to 100 feet below the surface and checked 
oysters manually, one at a time, in search of theSee GEM, page A7

Scientists discover new atomic baryon
Robert Kaminski/Photo Editor
Research scientist Tanja Schultz is one of the team members working on 
the lip-reading translator.
by Kathy Chiapaikeo
Staffwriter
Move over, protons; scientists 
at the Department of Energys 
Collider Detector at Fermilab 
(CDF) discovered two rare types 
of Sigrna-b baryon particles.
The discovery was made last 
month, leaving some scientists 
to question the correctness of 
the standard thought that the 
nucleus is made of only protons 
and neutrons.
The CDF is composed of 500 
physicists from around the 
world who work together at the 
federally funded Fermi National 
Accelerator Laboratory to bring 
new discoveries and advance
ments in understanding matter 
and energy.
Baryons are particles that 
contain three quarks. Scientists 
consider quarks to be the most 
fundamental building blocks of 
matter.
There are six different types 
of them: up (u), down (d),
strange (s), charm (c), bottom 
(b), and top (t).
Protons and neutrons are 
each made of three quarks, uu-d and d-d-u, respectively. But 
scientists at the CDF discovered 
two new baryons composed of 
up and bottom quarks (u-u-b), 
as well as down and bottom 
quarks (d-d-b).
These particles are like rare 
jewels that we mined out of our 
data, said CDF spokesperson 
Jacobo Knigsberg. Piece by 
piece, we are developing a bet
ter picture of how matter is built 
out of quarks. We learn more 
about the subatomic forces that 
hold quarks together and tear 
them apart. Our discovery helps 
complete the periodic table of 
baryons. 
Robert Roser, another CDF 
spokesperson at Fermilab, 
stated, This information is one 
more piece of the puzzle in try
ing to understand how you can 
make matter out of these small 
atomic particles.
Physicists use Fermilabs Tevatron collider, billed as the 
worlds most powerful particle 
accelerator, to re-create the 
conditions of the universe as it 
was in the moments after the 
big bang.
In the Tevatron, protons and 
antiprotons are accelerated by 
an electric field until they ap
proach the speed of light. The 
particles then collide, releasing 
a significant amount of energy 
and transforming into mass. 
The physicists then study the 
properties of these particles.
Over a period of five years, the 
Tevatron produced over more 
than 100 trillion high-energy 
proton-antiproton collisions. 
The CDF experiment identified
103 u-u-b particles (positively 
charged Sigma-b particles) and 
134\d-d-b particles (negatively 
charged Sigma-b particles).
Using the data from the CDF 
detector, Carnegie Mellon pro
fessors Manfred Paulini and 
James Russ study a wide variety

A new device could allow us
ers to say something in another 
language without actually hav
ing to speak the language  or 
speak at all for that matter.
A team of researchers at the 
Language Technologies Institute 
(LTI) has developed a prototype 
for a device that translates what 
a user is saying, but does not re
quire the user to speak the words 
out loud.
Instead, the device relies on 
electrodes attached to the mus
cles on the face and neck to de
tect small electrical currents that 
are produced whenever someone 
moves his or her lips to speak.
These electrical currents form 
typical patterns when the user is 
speaking certain words. A com
puter chip in the device monitors 
these patterns and recognizes 
the words.
The text is then translated to a 
different language, and the de
vice speaks the translation using 
a synthesis program developed 
by the company Cepstral.
Currently, the prototype sup
ports English to Spanish or Ger
man and Chinese to English.
But a new development in 
October shifted the focus of the 
research from monitoring stan
dard patterns of whole words to 
monitoring specific phonemes, 
the smaller units of sound that 
compose different words. This 
makes the device more flexible 
because it allows the device to
link together the sounds to form 
many more words.
So far, the prototype only has 
about a hundred words in its vo
cabulary, allowing users to cre
ate 30 to 40 sentences. But the 
average person can create more 
than 40 sentences on any given 
day. This presents a challenge for 
the translator to remain stable 
and accurate.
The more units you allow in 
your search, the higher the confusability. The higher the confusability, the higher the chances 
that you can confuse words 
among each other, said research 
scientist Tanja Schultz.
We havent really fully ex
plored this technology for a large 
vocabulary. We dont know what
the performance would be if we 
do this.
Although there are other 
translators available on the mar
ket, they dont function like the 
teams translator does. Current 
translators use microphones and 
recognition software to listen 
to what the user is saying. As a 
result, they dont work as well 
when there is a lot of background 
noise, especially in crowded en
vironments such as airports or 
emergency rooms. The transla
tion is less accurate when the 
speech is unclear.
But because the new translator 
functions even when the user is 
silent, it would reduce situations

Helpful devices :
The assistive technology field continues to rapidly expand
by Albert Lin
Staffwriter
According to a 1999 report is
sued by the U.S. Census Bureau, 
approximately 1.6 percent of 
Americans would not be able to 
hear a car approaching if they 
were crossing the street  if as
sistive medical technologies had 
not been developed, that is.
Assistive technology can be 
seen almost anywhere today, 
from people using wheelchairs 
and prosthetic limbs to the 
closed captioning that comes 
standard on a typical television 
today.
The medical technology field 
consists of two separate parts. 
The first is biomedical technol
ogy, which focuses on saving 
lives and temporarily dealing 
with acute injuries. The second 
part is assistive, or rehabilita
tive, technology that primarily
deals with long-term disabili
ties and improving the 
quality of life for the 
disabled.
Rory Cooper, a 
professor at the 
University 
of Pittsburghs 
Human En
gineering 
Research 
Laboratories, 
iStockPhoto.com/Mark Evans Said that assistive technology is 
a scientific and clinical under
standing of the interaction of peo
ple and the importance of fitting 
the technology for the user. 
Standard assistive technolo
gies include wheelchairs, canes 
and crutches, and communica
tion devices. These devices facil
itate and promote independent 
living for those with permanent 
disabilities or injuries. Assistive 
technologys main goal is to try 
to restore a normal, functioning 
lifestyle for disabled persons.
With developments in medical 
practice and biomedical technol
ogy, patient survival has risen 
dramatically since World War 
II, when the federal government 
first initiated formal research 
and development programs for 
biomedicine. Recently, the ap
plication of computers in the 
field has led to numerous tech
nological advances.
Personal computers had just
begun to become commercial, 
and the use of microprocessors 
was slowly becoming integrated 
with rehabilitative technology, 
said Mark Friedman, an adjunct 
biomedical engineering profes
sor at Carnegie Mellon.
For example, the hearing aid 
is a common form of assistive 
technology, but it did not always 
incorporate electronic compo
nents.
A hearing aid from the late 
18th and 19th centuries con
sisted of a long tube with a 
flared, horn end directing 
sounds to the patients ear. In 
contrast, its modern relative 
now utilizes micro-electronics 
to deliver an extremely mobile 
hearing system for patients.
Wheelchairs have also expe
rienced technological improve
ments. In the past, wheelchairs 
were constructed from heavy 
steel or wood frames with 
leather cushioning. Now, wheel
chairs are constructed from 
lightweight metals, such as alu
minum or titanium alloys, to 
make transportation much less 
taxing on the user.
Wheelchairs can now also be 
juiced up. Some use motors to 
drive the wheels. Power wheel
chairs utilize electronic technol
ogy to read user input from a joy
stick, which controls the wheel 
motors to propel the wheelchair 
in a specified direction.
But having the latest technol
ogy usually comes with a large 
price tag.
Friedman said that many of 
his students approach assistive 
technology with a skeptical eye. 
Students look at technology 
and say that they can do it for 
much less. What they fail to re
alize is that the technology must 
be robust, intuitive, reliable, 
serviceable, and marketable.
And medical centers now ac
commodate people who need 
assistive technology. The Cen
ter for Assistive Technology at 
University of Pittsburgh Medi
cal Center is one such facility. 
According to the centers web
site, it helps people function 
normally with their disabilities 
by providing them with assis
tive technologies such as wheel
chairs, speech output devices, 
and even recreational devices 
like specialized skis and cycles.
Friedman and Cooper ob
serve certain similar trends in 
the use of assistive technology. 
Due to drastic improvements in 
health care, more people now 
require assistive technology to 
help overcome their disabilities, 
which means a more diverse 
user population.
New models of existing de
vices are beginning to account 
for the many variations in pa
tient age and disability type, 
such as technologies for disabled 
infants and for people with obe
sity problems.
Medical Note: The common cold
by Sarah Mogin
Assistant Pillbox Editor
Over the years, scientists have 
engineered vaccines for some of 
the most widespread and dev
astating diseases, including po
lio, tuberculosis, and smallpox. 
But even modern medicine is no 
match for one of the most preva
lent ailments: the common cold.
Though the common cold is 
usually a minor affliction, its 
cumulative effects are severe. 
Adults contract two to four cold 
viruses a year, while children 
suffer anywhere from six to 12.
In 1996, the National Center 
for Health Statistics reported 
that approximately 22 million 
student sick days were coldrelated.
The common cold isnt just a 
virus  its about 200 different
viruses. Each virus has a unique 
set of antigens, chemicals that 
cause a response from the im
mune system.
Depending on their severity, 
cold symptoms may vanish after 
two days or persist for up to two 
weeks. These symptoms, includ
ing difficulty breathing through 
the nose, headache, cough, and 
sore throat, are actually caused 
by the bodys own immune sys
tem.
When nasal cells succumb to a 
common cold virus, white blood 
cells arrive at the area of infec
tion and release various immune 
system chemicals.
Scientists suspect that these 
emissions cause the symptoms 
associated with the common 
cold.
The common cold is not with
out its myths. Though exposure 
to winter climates is often as
sociated with catching a cold, 
there are no data to support 
such a correlation. In reality, 
cold weathers only effect is that 
it inspires more people to stay 
indoors, thus encouraging the 
spread of germs.
Traditionally, un
healthy habits in 
diet and exercise 
have also been 
linked to increasing 
an individuals 
susceptibility 
to the com
mon cold.
However, current available 
research suggests that poor diet 
and exercise are unrelated, un
like stress, nasal allergies, and 
menstrual cycles, which have 
been linked as causes.

How Things Work: Mechanical hearts
Michael Whiston
According to the Current Sci
ence and Technology Center,
16,000 Americans are in need of 
a heart transplant. Only a cou
ple thousand of these patients, 
though, receive treatment.
Shortages in treatment for 
heart-failure patients has led 
researchers to develop mechan
ical hearts that are capable of 
doubling peoples life expectan
cies.
But what all goes into a me
chanical heart? There is more 
than just nuts and bolts to a de
vice that keeps people living.
William Devries developed 
the first replacement heart in 
1982, called the Jarvik-7.
This aluminum and plastic 
device is driven by air that trav
els from an external compres
sor and into the patients chest 
through external wiring.
The Jarvik-7 replaces the 
left and right ventricles of the 
patients heart, which are the 
two main parts of a heart, and 
pumps blood to the body using 
rubber diaphragms.
The more recent version of 
the Jarvik-7 is SynCardias CardioWest Temporary Total Ar
tificial Heart. This air-driven 
mechanical heart performs the 
work of the ventricles and four 
heart valves.
The CardioWest completely 
replaces the original heart. Like 
the Jarvik-7, it connects to an
air hose that originates from a 
machine containing pressur
ized air.
The CardioWest operates by 
dividing each ventricle into two 
regions. One region of the ven
tricle fills with air, placing pres
sure on the other region, which 
pushes blood out of the heart 
and into the body.
The CardioWest is meant to 
be temporary. Approved by the 
FDA in 2004, the CardioWest is 
designed to support the bodys
circulatory system only until a 
heart donor is found.
Similarly, ventricular assist 
devices (VADs) are artificial 
hearts that assist the actual 
heart, usually by pumping blood 
from the left ventricle to the 
aorta. VADs are used to support 
hearts that have been weakened 
by heart attack or surgery.
The Jarvik-7 and CardioWest 
both require external wiring, 
called drivelines, for opera
tion. However, Massachusetts 
health-care company Abiomed 
developed a completely selfcontained artificial heart in 
2001. It is called the AbioCor 
Replacement Heart.
The AbioCor heart pumps 
more than 10 liters of blood per 
minute, thereby supporting the 
bodys entire circulatory system. 
It replaces only the ventricles of 
the heart, however, leaving the 
left and right atria, aorta, and 
pulmonary artery.
In an actual human heart, 
the atria contract simultane
ously and send blood into the 
ventricles. The ventricles then 
contract and send blood into 
the body. AbioCor, though, only 
pumps blood out of one ventri
cle at a time.
The two-pound AbioCor heart 
consists of a hydraulic pump, 
porting valve, and wireless en
ergy transfer system.
The hydraulic pump performs 
most of the work. The pump 
pushes fluid to the left and right
of the heart through the porting 
valve, causing blood to circulate 
to the lungs and throughout the 
body.
This pumping action can 
be managed by the controller, 
which is located within the ab
domen.
The wireless energy system 
is the means by which energy 
is transferred from the external 
battery to the internal battery 
of the artificial heart. The energy system transfers energy by 
sending it across the skin from 
the systems external coil to its 
internal coil.
Through this process, the 
larger battery recharges the 
smaller battery.
Prior to surgery, doctors per
form X-ray and CAT scans to 
ensure that the heart will fit in 
the patients chest. During the 
seven-hour surgery, the left and 
right ventricles of the original 
heart are completely removed 
and replaced by the AbioCor 
heart.
The AbioCor heart is only 
meant for heart-failure patients 
who have a life expectancy of 
less than 30 days. It is intended 
to double the life expectancies 
of these patients in order to give 
them more time to find a trans
plant.
Abiomed is currently develop
ing the AbioCor II heart, which 
will be 30 percent smaller than 
the AbioCor I heart and will 
have a five-year reliability.

Tests underway for 
fake pancreas
Scientists at Cambridge Uni
versity are currently testing an 
artificial pancreas for children 
with Type 1 diabetes. The de
vice, which consists of a glu
cose sensor, insulin pump, and 
a processor, would be partially 
implanted into children whose 
bodies are incapable of produc
ing insulin.
The glucose sensor will con
tinuously monitor blood sugar 
levels and signal the insulin 
pump when sugar levels become 
too high, replacing the normal 
functions of a pancreas.
Scientists are optimistic with 
the initial results, which have 
been shown to significantly im
prove blood glucose control, 
and hope to have a commercial 
version available in four to seven 
years.

Vision restored in 
blind mice
Research on blind mice has 
shown that immature lightdetecting (rod) cells injected 
into a mouses retina will au
tomatically align themselves 
properly in their host, helping 
to restore the hosts sight.
Previous studies have only 
been able to salvage vision that 
was deteriorating by providing 
nutrients to dying cells; this is 
the first study to show that the 
retina from a completely blind 
animal can be repaired and 
made functional.
The cells used are ones that 
have matured beyond the em
bryonic stem cell stage but have 
not fully developed into rod 
cells. The specific defect treated 
in the mice is similar to macular 
degeneration, which is one of 
the leading causes of blindness 
in humans.

FCC gives legal 
okay for BPL
The FCC has officially en
dorsed Broadband over Powerlines (BPL) as an information 
service, giving it the same legal 
status as conventional broad
band services, such as cable and 
DSL.
BPL uses existing electrical 
power lines to deliver high-speed 
Internet content, but is still in its 
infancy and is currently only re
sponsible for a very small share 
of the broadband market. This 
FCC ruling goes far in alleviat
ing concerns about its future, 
clearing the way for growth of 
the industry.

New DVD formats 
mean more extras
Wasting no time in the format 
wars between HD-DVD and Bluray, movie studios have started 
releasing movies in these new, 
high-definition formats. With 
six times the storage capacity of 
traditional DVDs, the extra space 
in the formats allow for more indepth special features, including 
extra commentaries and interac
tive content such as games.
Some are skeptical, however, 
of the revenue-generating ca
pability of these special features 
because it is unclear whether 
customers want or are interested 
in any of the additional content

Translator 
eliminates 
voice need
LIPS, from A5
where this could occur, and it 
is much easier for the user to 
make sure that only what he or 
she is saying is actually being 
translated. In any case, an ac
curate translation is vital.
The other intriguing thing 
about the prototype is that you 
can mouth words, Schultz 
said. For everybody whos do
ing speech recognition and who 
knows how challenging it is to 
get speech recognition to work 
in these noisy environments, I 
think thats another very neat 
aspect.
While the translators cur
rently on the market allow a 
user to review the recognized 
text on a screen before they 
speak the translation, the pro
totype aims to speak the trans
lations instantaneously.
The user could check the 
translation before it goes out to 
the listener by having the trans
lation run in the background, 
but it would require a longer de
lay to respond and it would be 
distracting to check the transla
tion and speak at the same time. 
Researchers have to ensure the 
device is accurate enough that 
users can be confident of the 
translation without needing to 
review it.
A silent translator would 
also be useful in situations that 
require someone to be quiet, 
such as a meeting. In one of the 
demonstrations of the device, 
the user answers the phone and 
responds to the another person 
without causing a disturbance 
because he spoke silently, let
ting the device speak for him.
Although the device has a 
lot of potential uses, imple
mentation of the device for the 
broader public could be more 
difficult. The prototype re
quires wired electrodes to be 
attached to the face and throat, 
making the unit difficult to 
carry around.
However, Schultz believes 
this might not be such an issue 
in the future if researchers can 
develop wireless electrodes 
that could be inserted into the 
face.
People do all sorts of pierc
ing and tattooing, and so maybe 
at some point we can, for ex
ample, inject little pieces into 
our cheek, said Schultz. Who 
knows whats coming?'
People might not welcome 
the idea right now, but these 
minor enhancements could end 
up being very persuasive, espe
cially because they would en
able people to communicate ef
fectively in multiple languages. 
By building technology that 
powers translation, researchers 
could help eliminate the differ
ences between the thousands of 
languages in the world.
It would really allow us to 
tear down the language bor
ders, said Schultz.

Aside from research at Fermilab, they are also looking

Simulating particle decays 
using computer programs and 
tracing particle trajectories 
through a computer image of 
the CDF detector are essential 
for understanding where in the 
real detector we might have 
missed recording Sigma-b par

I think particle physics 
is moving to its very excited 
times again because different 
fields of physics are coming 
together to answer the same 
question, What happened in 
the early universe and where 
did everything come from? 
Paulini said.
I think a lot will be discov
ered in the next 10 years. Its 
a privilege to be a part of this 
revolution in science.
Gem & Mineral Show to feature pearls, exotic jewels
GEM, from A5
the gem and mineral market.
The Carnegie Museum of 
Natural Historys annual Gem 
& Mineral Show has mirrored 
the trend of rising global inter
est. It has gotten bigger in all 
aspects, said Leigh Kish, a mar
keting assistant at the museum. 
Its consistently voted one of 
the best gem and mineral shows 
in the country.
The growth is evident in the 
participation of vendors. The 
museum provides nearly all of 
its available space to make room 
for their booths, suites, and dis
plays. The vendors are inter
national, Kish explained, so 
we have people flying all over 
the world to participate in the 
show.
Another important part of 
the Gem & Mineral Show is its 
appeal to children. Its a lot of
hands-on and take-stuff-home 
sort of activities, Kish said.
Children have the opportunity 
to learn how to identify stones, 
including birthstones. Theres 
also a mining car exhibit in the 
works, where a car will drop off 
stones to be categorized.
Probably the most exciting 
of the childrens activities is 
sluicing (panning for gold).
Its an actual working sluice, 
Kish said, and once the children 
find the specimens they take 
them back to identify them and 
learn about them.
For adults visiting the mu
seum, vendors are the primary 
educators.
Its a learning experience for 
everyonenot just for children, 
Kish said. All the vendors are 
experienced in their fields and 
so they give little mini-lessons 
while youre at their booth. 
Moses Jewelers, a familyowned chain of stores in Butler, 
Pa., is one such vendor. This will 
be Moses Jewelers eighth year 
participating in the Gem & Min
eral Show.
We bring rare pearls that 
people dont see very often, 
said Tim Moses, a member of 
the staff.
The show is an event for the 
vendors as much as the patrons. I 
buy minerals every time, Moses 
said. I think the most interesting 
things I find are the mineral spec
imens that can be purchased.
Kicking off with a Sea of 
Pearls Gala, this weekends Gem 
& Mineral Show is the culmina
tion of a lot of hard work, plan
ning, and passion.
The whole thing is a bazaar, 
and so its a really great oppor
tunity to see things that you 
wouldnt normally see, said 
Kish. Theres really something 
for everyone.

New memes spread like viruses 
through the body of the Net
Evan Sundwick
You may have seen some peculiar cats 
lately. Kittens with sniper rifles, big fat 
cats with jars on their heads, felines 
trapped in the shower, and of course, 
cats eating invisible sandwiches. The 
source of these ridiculous household 
pets? Its just another Internet meme 
 a cultural tidbit that has been passed 
from person to person a little bit like a 
virus.
You will hear over and over that the 
Internet is one of the most important 
technological advancements of our time. 
My journalism professor, Tom OBoyle, 
frequendy stressed this fact: We are liv
ing, at this moment, through what could 
very well be the biggest, most funda
mental change in the way people think 
and communicate since Gutenberg cre
ated moveable type.
The Internet is an organism, in a loose 
sense of the word. It has its own brand 
of intelligence, thanks to the distributed 
intellect of millions of users around the 
world. The power behind Wikipedia, 
YouTube, and even Google is all built 
around the sheer volume of users and 
content on the Internet; problems are 
solved faster than ever when hundreds 
of brains are churning away at a single 
question. It has never been easier to be 
exposed to brand new ideas and ways of 
thinking, and the impact of that is start
ing to be felt in popular culture.
In a world where your friends might
ens of altered images using the catchphrase  taken from a poorly-translated 
Nintendo game  in real-world situa
tions (on movie theater marquees, on 
church signs, on the sides of jetliners, 
etc.), hit the Internet in 2000. It spread 
rapidly across the Web and into the 
minds of Internet users, and now the 
phrase will trigger instant recognition in 
many people, though being in tune with 
Internet culture is obviously going to 
influence that recognition.
That is the really interesting thing 
about these Internet memes  they can 
be a clear indicator of how aware a per
son is of the subculture that the Internet 
has created. Some things have hopped 
over the boundary from Internet culture 
to the larger Zeitgeist of popular culture: 
Snakes on a Plane, for instance, first 
gained notoriety because some people 
on the Internet thought that the movie 
had an absolutely ridiculous title for an 
equally ridiculous premise.
Think backwho first told you about 
Samuel L. Jacksons travails on an air
craft with legless reptiles? It was proba
bly a friend sending you a link accompa
nied by commentary along the lines of 
dude check this out, this looks wicked 
hilarious! This is a prime example of 
how memes can spread.
Odds are youve run across a great 
deal of memes in your time here. The 
recent explosion of Chuck Norris wor
ship? Thats a meme. It all started, prob
ably, with Conan OBriens Walker; 
Texas Ranger Lever, in which OBrien 
would pull a giant lever, triggering the 
display of a short clip from Norriss midThink back  who first told you about Samuel 
L. Jacksons travails on an aircraft with legless 
reptiles? It was probably a friend sending you a 
link accompanied by commentary along the lines of 
dude check this out, this looks wicked hilarious! 
This is a prime example of how memes can spread.
send you dozens of YouTube links, ran
dom blog posts, and weird news sto
ries every day, memes can be born and 
spread in a matter of hours. A meme 
is like a gene of culture  a con
cept, idea, phrase, picture, even video 
clip  that is transmitted from person 
to person. Its the individual unit that 
makes up culture. They are transmitted 
like genes, passed on from one person 
to the next.
If this sounds familiar, it should; 
viruses spread the same way. You have 
probably heard of the term Viral adver
tising, a method of getting word out 
about a product or service through ads 
that dont try to push a product. They 
rely solely on people showing it to oth
ers, saying Hey, this is so weird, or 
Dude, check out this kickass video. 
You can find viral videos and websites 
everywhere, but most of them end up 
finding a home on sites like YouTube. 
A recent hit was an ad for Sonys Bravia 
line of HDTVs, which featured a large 
apartment building and the surrounding 
neighborhood engulfed in thousands of 
gallons of exploding paint.
Viral advertising is one thing  the 
viral spread of random funny memes 
is something else entirely. There is no 
greater cause here, no product to adver
tise, no idea to spread; these memes 
spread because people find them funny 
and they send them to their friends, who 
also find it funny, and the cycle repeats 
from there. One of the earliest and best 
examples of the power of these memes 
was the Flash animation All Your Base 
Are Belong To Us.
The animation, which featured doz90s TV show. Later, a website called 
Chuck Norris Facts gained popularity; 
the site allowed users to submit littleknown facts about Norris, which were 
actually fantastical accounts of Norriss 
godlike power. There was no real rea
son for this sudden spike of interest
 Walker, Texas Ranger was never a hit 
with our age group when it aired, and 
has only recently gained cult status. 
Nevertheless, the repeated exposure led 
to Norris development as an Internet 
meme, which seems to have propagated 
from pop culture to Internet culture and 
is now coming back into mainstream 
pop culture.
As for the cats? Each picture is accom
panied by a humorously misspelled mes
sage loosely tied to the content of the 
image  im in your sammich hiding 
ur meats, for example  and like many 
Internet memes, the images seem to 
have originated from an Internet mes
sage board (in this case, 4chan.org, 
a message board devoted to creating 
images of all kinds), and are starting to 
filter down through mass culture  the 
Facebook group Im in yo fridge! is 
devoted to these cat images, along with 
other Internet-centric pictures.
So the next time you read about a 
viral video or get a link to a seemingly 
nonsensical image, stop and think  
you might be helping to start something 
really big.

The excitement and inconvenience of CMU on the silver screen
The movie Smart People, about a wid
owed Carnegie Mellon English profes
sor, has been filming on campus for the 
past week, injecting a little glamour into 
the lives of students, faculty, and staff 
who frequent the second floor of Baker 
Hall. A few scenes are also taking place 
in Donner and Skibo Gym, and stu
dents have taken rubbernecking to new 
heights, trying to sneak a peek at the 
bearded Dennis Quaid or the sensual 
Christine Lahti.
Whats more, hearts pounded in antic
ipation at every high-heeled echo down 
the second-floor corridor, hoping to spot 
a pair of Manolo Blahniks clip-clopping 
down the gentle slope with Sarah Jessica 
Parker at the helm. Students clumped 
together in crowds around the directors 
chairs stenciled with impressive names,
proving a new truism: If you film it, they 
will come.
However, CMU on the silver screen 
hasnt been entirely excitement and 
glitz. Theres been a fair amount of in
convenience to contend with, too. Most 
students were not aware that Smart 
People would be filming here, and those 
who did werent prepared for the trucks 
and trailers that would monopolize 
parking behind Hunt and Baker for a 
week, leaving no alternative for the stu
dents, faculty, and staff who usually use 
the lot.
Then there are the key grips. Or gaf
fers, or best boys, or whatever those 
egomaniacal tech types in black T-shirts 
and headsets are called, shushing pro
fessors and locking down the hallway 
at every call of Action! Is it really nec
essary to film at peak hours, when stu
dents and faculty have no choice but to 
navigate the narrow path carved out by 
equipment and lights stacked in bulky 
rows? All parties are inconvenienced by 
the traffic.
However, the groans and gripes might 
just be our way of keeping cool in all the 
excitement, offsetting our impulses to 
gush to Dennis Quaid about how much 
we loved The Parent Trap or The Rookie, 
asking him to sign a baseball for us, or 
what it was like to work with Lindsay 
Lohan before she learned the C-word 
and used it to describe Paris Hilton.
Our complaints are belied by the pop
ularity of the I was (sorta) in the Movie 
Smart People group on Facebook.

and deep down, we secretly love it.

One million dollars.
When you draw out the first vowel in 
million and place the tip of your pinky 
next to your mouth, you comically con
jure Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.
When you assign it as bond for two 
students trying to scale a wall with a 
folding chair, you emphasize the role of 
racial profiling in law enforcement.
We were shocked to hear that our 
peers, senior Sudeep Paul and junior 
Anand Durvasula, were caught break
ing into Heinz Field a few hours before 
a Steelers game last Sunday. The two 
were attempting to film a final project 
video for a class. Trespassing is a crime 
regardless of movie-making intentions, 
and we dont want to disregard the con
sequences of their breach in common 
sense. Especially coming on the heels 
of a serious terrorist threat to NFL sta
diums a few weeks prior, the act should 
have been taken very seriously  and 
we were glad it was.
But we were appalled to hear how 
quickly the police assessed the situ
ation as an act of terror  especially 
without commanding evidence: Though 
they first walked away when a security 
guard approached them, Paul and Dur
vasula never resisted apprehension. 
Though they first lied about their reason 
for being there, the pair told the truth 
quickly thereafter. Though four bomb 
dogs were brought in and two positive 
hits for explosives were made on Paul 
and Durvasulas vehicle, police never 
found explosives. In fact, false positives
are common with bomb-detection dogs
 especially around camera equip
ment, which the police found in the car, 
and which makes sense within the video 
project explanation.
However, the initial police report re
veals authorities prejudice. It identified 
the pair as 2 Middle Eastern males. 
Paul and Durvasula are U.S.-born citi
zens of Indian descent.
It doesnt add up, then, for the magis
trate to assign an exceedingly high bond 
of $1 million to students held on counts 
of trespassing and conspiracy  not on 
a more grave offense such as treason, 
attempted murder, or making threats of 
terrorism.
Since 9/11, citizens have insisted on 
living in a highly secure society,' and 
we commend the Heinz Field security 
personnel for taking action quickly and 
decisively. But we dont understand 
holding two students on a $1 million 
bond for trespassing because they look 
Middle Eastern.
It would not unduly burden security 
officials to remember the difference be
tween a sovereign Asian subcontinent 
thousands of miles from a fractious geo
graphical region.
This element is especially disturbing. 
Not only are local law enforcement of
ficers woefully ignorant of ethnic iden
tities, but they proved such identities 
are enough to consider offenders guilty 
until proven innocent. Even if Paul and 
Durvasula were of Middle Eastern de
scent, that should not have been a rea
son enough to hold them on such a hefty 
bond  especially because their names 
were not on any potential terrorist list 
and they had no prior arrests.
That said, this event has been highly 
instructive. It emphasizes the impor
tance of our Constitutional right and 
civic duty to monitor government and 
law enforcement. Security and scrutiny 
must go hand in hand. It is up to us to' 
maintain the right balance.
In that vein, we also commend and 
thank the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for 
its November 8 editorial, which pointed 
out almost immediately how the situ
ation was blown out of proportion. A 
news article the next day revealed that 
a city magistrate set their [Pauls and 
Durvasulas] $1 million bond on his own 
without input from the district attor
neys office, the U.S. attorneys office or 
the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Being considered innocent until 
proven guilty is one of Americans 
inalienable rights, and thankfully, the 
district attorneys office recognized this 
when it released Paul and Durvasula on 
their own recognizance last Wednesday 
evening.
In the end, everyone screwed up. Au
thorities set bond before considering all 
the evidence, and Paul and Durvasula 
sullied CMUs intellectual reputation 
by being thoughtless enough to break 
into a stadium one week after a credible 
bomb threat. Felonies are never justified
 even when committed in the name of 
homework.

Carnegie Skills 
Workshop to 
enhance CSW
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Carnegie Mellon isnt like just 
any other university. We should 
celebrate our uniqueness. You 
might laugh if I said that this 
could start with  and you might 
have to read this twice  CSW.
But why not? This is the single 
course on our campus that ev
ery undergraduate must take. 
We dont want to make passing 
CSW harder to achieve, we just 
want to make it more enjoyable 
and worthwhile to achieve. CSW 
should be an effective, efficient, 
and important class. It should 
reflect who we are.
CSW should reflect the pride 
we have for our campus, and it 
should give us the skills we need 
to succeed within our campus 
community. A functioning level 
of computer skills is necessary to 
be successful at Carnegie Mellon 
 but we need to know more 
than AFS to make the most of 
our time here. CSWs course de
signers have recognized this and 
have most recently expanded the 
curriculum to include respon
sible computing and university 
libraries components. Its time 
for another expansion.
We have resources to offer that 
students need to know about. We 
have a Career Center, an Office 
of International Education, and 
a Fellowship Resource Advising 
Center. We have a worldrenowned conservatory with 
shows every week, and sports 
teams that are breaking records.
Students need to know about 
tutoring, CMARC, and syncing 
calendars. What about green re
sources on campus, public trans
portation, and athletic facilities? 
This is all knowledge that stu
dents (hopefully) acquire during 
their tenure at Carnegie Mellon. 
It just shouldnt take two or three 
years to collect all that informa
tion. Navigating your way around 
campus is important to succeed 
at this school, and a Carnegie 
Skills Workshop would go be
yond the digital.
CSW is a course with a great 
history; it recognizes the spe
cial demands of. the Carnegie 
Mellon student. From its incep
tion, it has aimed to arm stu
dents with skills they will need 
in our particular environment. 
It is, and should be, about cam
pus literacy. Computing skills are 
an integral and important part 
of these, but as the history of 
the course has shown us, not the 
only ones. Library research skills 
and responsible computing was 
a start. Its time to expand the 
course goals again. Its time for a 
Carnegie Skills Workshop.
Andrea Hamilton, student body 
vice-president, and Evan Osheroff 
the Student Senate Academic 
Affairs chair; are meeting with 
the CSW committee today. And 
remember; please let them know 
what you think!
Last week, scenes from the movie Smart People were shot on campus. We wondered,
If a movie were made about you and your life at Carnegie Mellon, what would it be called?A PERSONS OPINION
Compiled by Joshua Bordin and James Ramp
Preserving free (if controversial) speech; updating Hunt
In the Executive Privilege dated No
vember 6, 2006, Brad Yankiver incor
rectly mentioned Malik Zulu Shabazz 
as a member of the Black Panther Party 
for Self Defense (BPPSD). Mr. Shabazz 
is the leader of the New Black Panther 
Party (NBPP), a group that is ideologi
cally aligned with the Nation of Islam.
The Black Panther Party for Self 
Defense was formed in 1966 by Huey 
Newton and Bobby Seale, and was 
formed for and fought for the goal of 
securing social justice for black people 
living within the United States. It pro
vided social services to the community, 
at one point feeding over 10,000 in
ner-city schoolchildren breakfast ev
ery morning. It organized against the 
reality of police brutality and racism 
during the 1960s and 1970s. Opera
tions all but ceased by the early 1980s, 
largely due to coordinated police and 
FBI oppression as a part of the COINTELPRO program.
The Ashanti Alston event happened 
in the post-Shabazz atmosphere not 
because of the input from university 
officials, but in spite of it. There were
requests from the university to post
pone or cancel the event, but I and 
others refused. After all, I set about or
ganizing the event after learning that 
Mr. Shabazz would be coming to our 
campus because it was important to me 
that the campus be exposed to a posi
tive black radical voice.
The most surprising aspect of my 
closed-door meetings with university 
officials was a concern that Ashanti 
might discuss Israel, because they had 
circumstantial evidence that Ashanti 
supported the Palestinian right to selfdetermination. While I vehemently re
fused to add any rider to his contract to 
forbid Ashanti from discussing Israel, 
other students, in my place, might have 
caved to the universitys demands.
I wish to make this clear: Just be
cause Ashanti was able to speak does 
not mean that everyone, in practice, 
has freedom of speech on our campus. 
Policies alone cant create that free
dom.

The libraries thank Andrew Peters for his 
eloquent and thoughtful piece Hunt should 
be redesigned for the 21st-century student 
(November 6). Peters ideas coincide with 
our plans.
To recapture space for students, we built 
an offsite storage facility in 2005, which 
enabled us to transfer many older materials 
out of the libraries. Users can request stored 
materials and have them within 24 hours.
Our first project repurposing space 
was Maggie Murph Caf, funded by over 
$350,000 in gifts from alumni and friends of 
the Margaret Morrison College for Women.
In the last five years, other generous do
nors have also improved the library experi
ence for students: Margaret Cyert funded 
and then endowed finals study breaks, Vir
ginia Schatz seeded development of a recre
ational DVD collection, and Cyert and other 
alumni met a $500,000 challenge grant to 
establish a $1 million endowment for new 
electronic resources.
Other student-centered initiatives:
Plans are underway to create group study 
areas in Hunt and E&S libraries by fall 
2007, a napping pod is being considered, 
and Facilities Management will bring more
electrical outlets into Hunt by fall 2007.
Based on student requests, Hunt has al
ready instituted an extra week before finals 
of 24-hour opening to facilitate students 
completion of papers and projects.
The Libraries are seeking a student advi
sory group to assist planning and decision
making. I am in contact with student gov
ernment, graduate student associations, 
and dormitory council to identify inter
ested students who are willing to serve in 
an advisory capacity to the libraries.
Funding, of course, is the constraint, 
both in renovation plans and in hours of 
opening. Students expectations for the 
library  made plain by surveys, focus 
groups, and articles such as Peters  will 
always influence our thinking and plan
ning. The popularity of the renovated caf 
area this fall tells us that students enjoy the 
open, inviting atmosphere of Hunts glass 
and aluminum structure. We will continue 
to direct fundraising and other activities 
toward supporting 21st-century learning 
in all of the University Libraries.

The Democrats are coming! 
The Democrats are coming! Is it 
possible that the United States, 
after voting conservative in 
2000, 2002, and 2004, suddenly 
took a hard turn to the left? The 
spin on these past midterm elec
tions is composed mainly of the 
misconception that the United 
States has become increasingly 
liberal. While Republicans did 
lose, this switchover in Con
gress was a result of conservative 
backlash over a Republican fail
ure to stick to their conservative 
principles.
This was an in-house clean-up, 
not a blue tsunami.
The Democrats did a great job 
of creating media-led emotional 
banter and getting out the vote 
in higher numbers than usual. 
Yet turnout alone never fully ex
plains Democratic victories.
When Republicans lose, it is 
not because of higher liberal 
turnout, but due to a Republican 
failure to convince the base that 
they represent, and have acted 
on behalf of, core conservative 
values. These values are (and 
continue to be) fiscal conservativism, small government, the 
preservation of the family, bor
der control, a strong military, 
and steadfast conservative lead
ership. When Republican lead
ership violates these principles 
as they have in recent years, the 
base first warns them, next de
mands action, and finally kicks 
them out if their calls for action 
go unheeded.
Republicans run on principles, 
and are accordingly held to those 
very principles by the base.
There was, and remains, an 
entire faction of the Republican 
base  the true conservatives  
that has been hung out to dry over 
the past six years on almost every 
issue outside of the judiciary and 
the war on terror. Bushs insane 
desire for amnesty for illegal im
migrants, the runaway Congres
sional spending, and the failure 
to deliver decisive, punishing 
victory over our enemies in Iraq 
are responsible for turnover pro
duced by the conservative base.

In the 2006 midterm elections, 
the administrations continued 
snubbing of the base led to wider 
than expected losses across the 
board for Republicans.
The unhappiness with the 
incumbency disorder that af
flicted Republicans over the past 
six years caused the true base to 
turn incumbents out, while still 
protecting conservative values 
through referenda and other 
ballot measures. Completely un
known, to the party-line-only, noroom-for-debate liberals, there 
occurred a bout of intellectual 
honesty within the Republican 
Party which had the unfortunate 
repercussion of installing a so
cialist into House leadership, in 
the form of prospective Speaker 
of the House Nancy Pelosi.
The campaign that Pelosi and 
the liberal leadership orches
trated highlights another reason 
behind the continued existence 
of a conservative nation. Many 
of the newly elected Democrats 
ran on campaigns making them 
out to be more conservative 
than even their Republican op
ponents. The Democrats found 
moderate candidates, often so
cial conservatives or former ser
vicemen (and women), who for 
one reason or another were will
ing to run under the Democratic 
banner.
Heath Shuler is an example of 
a social conservative running, 
and winning, under the Demo
cratic banner. Another example 
is the apparent win of Harry 
Mitchell over J.D. Hayworth in 
Arizonas fifth Congressional 
district. Mitchells campaign 
depicted himself as an even 
stronger opponent of amnesty 
than the incumbent Hayworth. 
Senator-elect James Webb in Vir
ginia is another example of the 
approach to reduce the outward 
appearance of liberalism of the 
Democratic Party in a bid to se
cure power in Washington.
Make no mistake: The Repub
licans suffered widespread losses 
due to punishment by conserva
tive core value voters, not some 
spread of national liberalism.
This country is not liberal. If 
you turn on the dinosaur media 
(thanks Laura Ingraham), the ac
tion line is that the country has 
made a hard left turn. Wrong. 
The disparity among the many 
conservative ballot measures 
that passed and the GOP incum
bents that were not returned to 
office fleshes out the realization 
that the majority of the country 
retains conservative core values
while attempting to punish a 
party that violated its principles.
Take the example of Virginia. 
The voters of Virginia passed 
Ballot Question 1, a measure that 
proposed an amendment to Vir
ginia Constitution defining mar
riage as a contract between one 
man and one woman, by a 14- 
point margin. That strong conser
vative showing took place while 
incumbent Republican Senator 
Allen lost by a razor-thin margin 
of less than 1 percent to moder
ate Democratic challenger Sena
tor-elect Webb. Here, the base 
turned out, supported conserva
tive values, but did not support 
their incumbent.. The upholding 
of marriage as a union between 
a man and a woman passed in 
nearly every state  including 
Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina, 
South Dakota, Tennesee (81-19 
percent), and Wisconsin  with 
the exception of Arizona, where 
it failed 49-51.
There are countless other ex
amples of conservative values be
ing upheld nationwide from these 
most recent midterm elections. 
Take the example of Michigan. 
Three years ago, a pre-Roberts 
U.S. Supreme Court decided in 
favor of the University of Michi
gans affirmative action program
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff *
in a 5-4 decision. However, the 
people of Michigan decided 
that the courts did not speak 
for them when the voters acted 
in restricting and removing af
firmative action by a 16-point 
margin. In Arizona, English as 
the official language triumphed 
74-26 percent, while incum
bent Republican Hayworth lost 
a close race. Again, the conser
vative base upheld their values, 
while punishing a Congress 
they viewed as having let them 
down on principle.
While all true conservatives 
are saddened by the loss of a 
few true statesmen such as Al
len, Hayworth, Santorum, and 
Steele, do not let the big lie of 
increasing national liberalism 
take hold. This conservative 
market correction provides an 
opportunity for Republicans to 
reconsider, and acknowledge, 
the people that swept them into 
office in 1994, and for the GOP 
to regroup and get back on mes
sage. Republicans acted like 
Democrats and they lost. That 
is a lesson the GOP leadership 
should not soon forget.

Before the meet, the coach 
was telling us how Grove City

in the 200-yard breastroke. Seo 
won the 200-yard breaststroke

said. Last year we almost lost 
to [Grove City] at their invite. It 
came down to the last relay and 
we ended up winning, so based 
on that we thought it would be re

this year than they did last year, 
but we were able to sweep a cou

SPORTS COMMENTARY
First-ever Sports Elections
Doug Fricker
In lieu of the real elections 
this past Tuesday, the sports 
experts at The Tartan came up 
with the idea of the first-ever 
Sports Elections. Would you 
like to see Lance Armstrong 
as your commander-in-chief, 
or possibly Troy Polamalu 
stepping in to replace Donald 
Rumsfeld, our ex-secretary of 
defense?
We chose six political posi
tions, each with two candi
dates, and let the varsity ath
letes here at Carnegie Mellon 
vote for one candidate for each 
position, based on whos the 
most qualified, who theyd 
like to see in that position, or 
whoever they liked more.
The election for the Presi
dent of the United States pitted 
Lance Armstrong against Mi
chael Jordan. Armstrong won 
the Tour de France a record 
seven times after recovering 
from cancer, whereas MJ is 
considered by many the great
est basketball player of all 
time.
The Vice-President position 
showcased LeBron James and 
Derek Jeter. LeBron, consid
ered the Chosen One, is one 
of the top candidates for the 
NBA MVP award, Jeter is one 
of the most clutch players in 
all of Major League Baseball.
Troy Polamalu and Mike Ty
son were vying to be the next 
secretary of defense. Polamalu 
is the starting strong safety for 
the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tyson 
knows a thing or two about 
fighting, with a once-promis
ing boxing career undermined 
by personal problems and 
periods of imprisonment. He 
now spends much of his time 
tending to his coop of around 
350 pigeons in Phoenix, Ariz.
Secretary of state saw Yao 
Ming versus David Beckham. 
Yao is one of the premier cen
ters in the NBA and stands 7'6" 
tall. Beckham is a celebrity 
even outside the football (soc
cer) world.
The secretary of the trea
sury came down to Tiger 
Woods and Alex Rodriguez. 
Woods, golfer extraordinaire, 
was the highest paid profes
sional athlete in 2005. A-Rod 
is currently the starting third 
baseman for the New York 
Yankees. Hes known for sign
ing the largest contract in 
sports history.
Last is the attorney general 
position, for which Terrell 
Owens and Barry Bonds were 
candidates. Owens has been 
among the. NFLs best wide 
receivers, as well as one of 
the leagues most controver
sial players. Bonds holds the 
record for most home runs in 
a season, but journalists have 
alleged that he used perfor
mance-enhancing substances.
Voting took place Friday 
night and all day Saturday. 
A record number of votes  
zero is an easy record to beat
 were cast over this period.
The voting for President 
was close, but His Airness 
Michael Jordan defeated the 
seemingly invincible Lance 
Armstrong 57 to 43 percent. 
Lance Armstrong shrugged 
off the defeat, saying that, 
deep down, he really wanted 
to be like Mike and actually 
voted for Jordan. He added 
that Space Jam was his favor
ite movie ever.
LeBron James was appar
ently too young to instill con
fidence in the voting public, 
falling to Derek Jeter 55 to 
41 percent. The other 4 per
cent went to Troy Polamalu. 
Some voters got confused 
and started voting for Steel
ers players at every position 
hoping it would translate into 
some victories for the team.
Polamalu won in a land
slide to become the secretary 
of defense. Mike Tyson failed 
again, this time so badly that 
some write-in candidates 
drew more votes than him. He 
announced that hes taking his 
pigeons and moving to Mon
golia, where he hopes he can 
start a new life.
Yao Ming nipped David 
Beckham 52 to 46 percent in
secretary of state voting. It is 
believed that Yaos close ties 
with China proved the decid
ing factor in this race. Yao 
became the tallest person ever 
on the Presidents cabinet. He 
arrived in Washington, D.C., 
earlier today, but couldnt fit 
inside the White House, so 
he stayed outside and spoke 
to the media while architects 
redesigned the entrance to the 
building.
Tiger Woods embarrassed 
Alex Rodriguez to become the 
new secretary of the treasury. 
Woods did his trademark fist 
pump upon hearing the news 
and gave a big smile. A-Rod 
was too busy watching replays 
of himself strike out in the 
MLB playoffs to comment.
No candidate received the 
necessary 50 percent majority 
in the attorney general voting. 
Bonds and Owens tied at 46 
percent, with Tiki Barber and 
Pete Rose among others also 
receiving votes.
In a case like this, we re
sorted to rock-paper-scissors, 
best out of three, between 
Bonds and Owens. Bonds won 
the first game and TO took the 
second.
At this point, Rose was ac
cused of betting on the first 
two games and banned from 
the rock-paper-scissors hall 
of fame. Barber announced 
his retirement, vowing never 
to run for public office again. 
Bonds won the third game on 
a controversial rock to paper 
switch that appeared to be 
after shoot was announced. 
Instant replays proved incon
clusive.
The play stood and Bondss 
paper defeated TOs rock. TO 
accused Bonds of using per
formance-enhancing drugs, 
claiming they allowed Bonds 
to gain an unfair advantage. 
Owens then badmouthed the 
referees, his coach, his politi
cal advisor, his hands, and his 
limo driver. Bonds became the 
new attorney general.
This concludes the Sports 
Elections. Thank you to all 
the athletes who voted.

Ice hockey 
wins two
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
The ice hockey club came 
from behind to defeat Califor
nia University of Pennsylvania 
two times in two weeks to bring 
its season record to 3-4.
On Sunday, November 5, the 
Tartans beat California 5-4. 
The Vulcans scored first with 
a power-play goal in the first 
period. Junior Tom Yaniglos 
scored short-handed to even 
the score at 1-1 going into the 
second period.
California came back to score 
twice in the second period be
fore sophomore Alex Brant 
scored on a power play. The 
Vulcans regained their twogoal lead, bringing the score to 
4-2.
In the third period, first-year 
Rorry Brenner scored a powerplay goal, bringing the Tartans 
within one. Senior Dan Gilmour scored on a five-on-three 
disadvantage to even the score 
at four apiece. Sophomore 
Steve Karolyi scored the gamewinning goal with a slap shot 
minutes later.
In a rematch against Califor
nia on Saturday, the Taftans 
quickly fell behind 2-0. Mas
ters student Matt Hawryluk got 
the Tartans on the board in the 
second period with a powerplay goal. Yaniglos scored less 
than a minute later to even the 
score. California came back, 
tipping the score 3-2 back in 
the Vulcans favor. Late in the 
second period, junior Ed Bergin 
flipped a shot into the top cor
ner of the net to even the score 
at three apiece.
California regained the lead 
within the first minute of the 
third period; Bergin made 
another shot seconds later to 
retie the game. Hawryluk gave 
the Tartans their first lead of 
the game, scoring twice in the 
next five minutes of play. The 
Vulcans regained one, but ulti
mately fell to the Tartans 6-5.

to nationals, but as long as were 
going, its fine, Haley said.
Womens cross country
On the womens side, Dickin
son College ran away with the
team title with 49 points. Haverfofd finished second overall with
104 points.
For the Tartans, first-years 
Hallie Espel and Danielle Sedlack 
ended rookie seasons by finish
ing 22nd and 38th overall in the 
6K race with times of 24:27 and 
25:00, respectively.
The course was sloppy and 
muddy, and people were fall
ing and slipping throughout the 
whole race, Espel said. I think 
it made the times comparably 
slower than last time at Waynes
burg.
Senior Jerri Castillo finished 
third for the team and 74th with 
a time of 25:58. Sophomore Car
olyn Clayton followed finishing 
with a time of 26:13. Senior cap
tain Stefani Penn finished fifth 
for the team in 27:29. Sopho
more Chrissy Krutz and junior 
Carrie Kmetzo rounded out the 
top seven with times of 27:43 
and 28:15, respectively.
Espel was named to the 
All-Mideast Region Team by 
finishing 22nd overall. She was 
also one of the top four first-years 
in the race.
Although no one qualified 
for the NCCA Championships, 
the womens ninth-place finish 
was one place better than their 
finish last year. It was good to 
see us improve from our 10thplace finish last year, Krutz said. 
We have a lot of young runners 
and I think we will continue to 
improve in the future.

senior midfielder Will Schlough. 
The ball bounced free in the box 
and Browne one-timed a shot
from five yards out past Gettys
burgs goalkeeper.
Standing near the right post, 
Browne registered the hat trick 
in the 16th minute when he onetimed a pass from Park into the 
goal. This marked his third ca
reer hat trick and first since his 
sophomore year.
Park added a goal of his own 
in the 56th minute when he col
lected his blocked shot and laced 
the ball inside the far left post 
from 18 yards out. Gettysburg 
added a late goal in the 80th 
minute to prevent the shutout.
Tartan sophomore goalkeeper 
Matthew Bazin and senior goal
keeper Robert Vargo combined 
to allow only one goal in their 
three tournament games. Bazin 
finished the season with nine
shutouts in 19 games and only 11 
goals allowed on the year.
Playing soccer at Carnegie 
Mellon has been the best thing 
for all of us really, Park said. 
Weve found a good group of 
friends that were going to have 
forever. I consider all the guys 
on the team my best friend. Ive 
definitely enjoyed the last four 
years. We had a disappointing 
stretch this season, but we got 
past that and went on and won 
this tournament.
Browne was named the Most 
Outstanding Player of the ECAC 
South tournament, thanks to his 
six goals in the three games. He 
finishes his career with 58 goals 
in 62 games played. The Tartans 
end their season with a record of 
14-5.
Football finishes perfect
FOOTBALL, from A12
rushing yards.
I said it last week [after top
ping the 1000-yard mark], Sivek 
said. Id like to thank everyone 
who Ive played with, this year 
and in the past. Everyone gives 
it their all every game.
Despite Siveks historic day 
and the valiant effort by the de
fense  holding Thiels potent 
offense to just 140 yards  the 
games most critical play came 
from a seldom-used special 
teams unit.
After LaScolas touchdown, 
3:33 remained in regulation  
plenty of time for the Tomcats to 
manage another score and pull 
even with the Tartans.
Thiel opted for an onside kick, 
but Carnegie Mellons hands 
team proved worthy of their 
nickname when first-year wide 
receiver Brendan Howe snatched 
the ball after it glanced off one of 
his teammates.
Knowing we had the ball, 
in their territory, with three 
minutes to go in the game, and 
knowing what we were able to 
do with Travis, we felt pretty 
good that we could get him up 
through there and get some 
yardage, Lackner said.
Sivek did just what his coach 
asked'of him. Six straight car
ries from the junior, followed by 
an eight-yard effort from junior 
running back Robert Gimson, 
produced two Tartan first downs. 
With less than a minute showing 
on the clock, the offense ran two 
final plays to close out the Tom
cats and escape Greenville, Pa. 
with a 14-7 victory.
The victory over a solid Thiel 
team not only cemented a bid 
for a postseason spot, but also 
fortified the Tartans big-game 
nerve.
Saturdays victory was just 
the second time this season 
that Carnegie Mellon defeated 
an opponent by fewer than 10 
points; the UAA championshipclinching defeat of Washington 
University was a 10-7 overtime 
victory. The Tartans cruised 
through their first eight games 
by a 30-8 average score.
The excitement that infused 
Thiels Alumni Stadium Satur
day afternoon should serve the 
Tartans well once the second 
season begins.
We made some mental mis
takes today, Sivek said. I think 
its good to get those out of the 
way now, rather than in the 
playoffs. Its good to be in that 
atmosphere before you go into 
the playoffs.
That unique playoff atmo
sphere along with the Millsaps 
College Majors  arrives at Gesling Stadium on Saturday as the 
NCAA Divison III playoffs com
mence.
Playoff teams are pretty spe
cial football teams, Lackner 
said. Theyre there for a reason. 
Its going to be a great challenge 
for our kids. But our kids came 
to Carnegie Mellon because of 
challenge. They came because 
they wanted to challenge them
selves academically, and they 
wanted to challenge themselves 
on the football field. So an op
portunity to play in a national 
playoff game is something they 
absolutely relish.

On Saturday Carnegie Mellons cross country teams re
turned to action to race at the 
Division III NCAA Mideast Re
gional in Waynesburg, Pa. The 
mens team finished third out of 
39 teams with 123 points over
all. The womens team finished 
in a ninth-place tie out of 41 
teams with 349 points.
Mens cross country
Haverford College defeated 
Allegheny College by three 
points to win the overall mens 
title, 51 and 54, respectively. 
Both Haverford and Allegheny 
automatically qualify for the 32- 
team NCAA championships by 
finishing in the top two from one 
of eight regional championships. 
The Tartans also qualified for 
the championships by securing 
one of the remaining 16 spots.
The field was soggy and 
muddy from the rain in the 
morning before the start of the 
8K race. It was impossible to get 
any momentum going because 
the footing was so sloppy, soph
omore Breck Fresen said. The 
conditions today definitely put 
the X back into XC.
Despite the wet and muddy 
running conditions, sophomore 
Brian Harvey led the Tartans, 
finishing sixth overall with a 
time of 26:33. Harvey indi
vidually qualified for the NCAA 
championships by finishing in 
the top seven runners.
Senior captain Geoff Misek fol
lowed to finish 19th overall with 
a time of 27:03. Fresen and firstyear Dario Donatelli finished 
closely behind Misek, both with 
times of 27:14. Fresen edged out 
Donatelli at the finish line to fin
ish third for the team.
We had really hoped to beat 
Allegheny and to at least be close 
to Haverford, but both teams had 
really strong performances and 
ran away with the race, Misek 
said.
Sophomore Mike Haley fin
ished fifth for th team with 
a time of 28:00. Junior Jason 
Jura and sophomore Bill Lordan 
rounded out the top seven with 
times of 28:56 and 29:22, re
spectively.
Harvey, Misek, Fresen, and

Carnegie Mellons womens 
soccer team wrapped up its sea
son this week with a 4-2 win 
over Emory University. During 
the game, junior midfielder 
Amanda Rose set up an assist 
that gave sophomore Abby Cof
fin her second hat trick of the 
season. This was Roses eighth
assist on the season, and her 
24th as a Tartan, breaking the 
former school record of 23 ca
reer assists. This week, The Tar
tan met with Rose to discuss the 
teams season, her success, and 
her new record.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing soccer? How did you get 
into the sport?
Rose: I started playing in 
first grade. Soccer was just get
ting really popular and all of my 
little friends were going to play 
and kept talking about it. So one 
day I kind of just went home and 
was like Hey mom, I want to 
play soccer. I really liked it and 
had fun and just stuck with it.
T: Did you always plan on 
playing in college?
R: Actually, yes. Most people 
arent always sure, but it was 
something I always knew I 
would want to do.
T: Have you always played 
midfield or have you switched 
positions a lot, especially since 
you started playing so young?
R: Well, when I first started 
playing, we were all really little, 
so it didnt matter too much 
they pretty much stuck you on 
the field somewhere. But then 
when you get older, they start to 
sort out which people are better 
suited for some positions, and 
Im strongest at midfield so Im 
happy to be there.
''  \
T: How do you manage Carn
egie Mellons academic load and 
soccer?
R: Im not going to lie, it can 
be pretty hard. Basically, you 
learn to manage your time re
ally well, and Im a junior now, 
so at this point I have the time 
thing pretty much down and it 
isnt too bad.
T: What do you focus on dur
ing a game to stay competitive?
R: I try to really just focus 
on the game. Try and block out 
everything else and just focus 
on whats going on and playing 
well.
T: Do you have any rituals or 
good luck charms for a game?
R: Obviously we all wear 
matching high socks, but un
der them, I always wear a little 
pair of pink ones  same socks, 
every game. I do wash them, 
though. I know some people
go the season without washing 
things, but at least I wash them.
T: Any accomplishments you 
are particularly proud of?
R: Im really excited about 
the assist record. I was kind of 
shooting for it, and Im only a 
junior, so it was really great to 
get it now and still have a whole 
season ahead of me.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable game?
R: Absolutely: last year, at 
home, when we beat Chicago. 
They were ranked eighth in the 
country, so everyone expected 
us to lose, and we all just got re
ally psyched up, went out and 
played really well, and had so 
much fun, and ended up beat
ing them 2-0.
 T: Do you have a favorite 
place to travel to?
R: Probably Chicago. Im 
from Colorado, so its hard for 
my mom to make it to a lot of my 
games, but Chicagos like a half
way point, so she always makes 
it to that one. Its really nice to 
get to see her and hang out, but 
the citys pretty fun too, I always 
have a good time there.

Last week, the Carnegie Mel
lon mens soccer team qualified 
for the 2006 Eastern College Ath
letic Conference (ECAC) Division 
III Mens South Soccer Champi
onships. As the number-two seed 
in the eight-team tournament, 
they defeated Westminster Col
lege on Wednesday and Alvernia 
College on Saturday to reach the 
championship game yesterday. 
Continuing their strong play, the 
Tartans defeated visiting Get
tysburg College 4-1 to win the 
ECAC South Title.
The Tartans opened the ECAC 
tournament at home against 
Westminster oh Wednesday, de
feating the Titans 3-0. Senior 
forward Andrew Park netted 
the Tartans first goal in the 
17th minute when he collected 
the ball outside the 18-yard box 
and blasted it past Westminsters 
goalkeeper.
On a wet field like this, the 
ball can pop out anywhere so you
have to be ready for it, Park said. 
I just got a lucky break and was 
able to get past one defender and 
the keeper wasnt ready for it.
Senior forward Jonathan 
Browne collected two goals late 
in the first half to finish off the 
scoring for Carnegie Mellon.
In the semifinals on Satur
day, Carnegie Mellon defeated 
the visiting Alvernia Crusaders
3-0. After a scoreless first half, 
Browne got the Tartans on the 
board in the 51st minute. Firstyear midfielder Jonathon Simon 
crossed the ball from the left end 
line back to Browne in the center 
of the box, who one-timed the 
pass into the net.
Park had a breakaway in the 
56th minute and, with Alvernias 
goalkeeper charging, Park ran 
onto the ball first, and his sliding 
shot from 30 yards out bounced 
past the goalie and into the net. 
The Tartans wrapped up their 
scoring in the 63rd minute when 
Simon headed in a cross off a 
pass, from first-year midfielder 
Ryan Browne.
Jonathan Browne capped an
illustrious career by scoring 
three goals in the championship 
game, all in the first 16 min
utes. Browne, Carnegie Mellons 
all-time goal and points leader, 
scored just 83 seconds into the 
game by using his head to rediby Adam Lazarus

Just like last years regular 
season finale, the Tartans and 
Tomcats put win-loss records, 
playoff dreams, and personal sta
tistics aside and simply brawled 
for 60 minutes.
The game wasnt over until it 
was over, head coach Rich Lackner said. It was a great team 
effort. .
Last year, the 5-4 Tartans bat
tled tooth and nail through three 
overtimes with 9-0 Thiel be
fore falling just short at Gesling 
Stadium 50-48 as the Tomcats 
secured their first-ever playoff
spot. In an ironic twist of fate, 
this year it was the 9-0 Tartans 
who outlasted 5-4 host Thiel 
to clinch their first post-season 
berth since 1997.
By consistently grinding out 
short yards and first downs 
through Thiels front seven, 
Carnegie Mellon clawed out a 
14-0 late-fourth-quarter lead.
Thiel snuck right back in the 
game when quarterback Billy 
Blankenship lofted a pass to a 
wide-open Marc LaScola in the 
back of the end zone for a 14- 
yard touchdown pass that cut the 
deficit in half.
The Tartans had built that lead 
mostly on the ground and mostly 
on the back of the University Ath
letic Associations (UAA) leading 
rusher, workhorse Travis Sivek. 
Last week, the junior became the 
second player in school history to 
top the single-season 1000-yard 
mark, but he had not finished 
compiling milestones.
After diving over a pile of Tom
cat defenders on the opening 
drive for his 12th rushing touch
down, Sivek gave the Tartans a 
quick 7-0 lead. As the game wore 
on, Sivek carried the ball a sea
son-high 40 times for 172 yards 
on the way to becoming Carnegie 
Mellons all-time leading rusher, 
surpassing Mike Crumpies 
1996-1999 mark of 2910 career ,

TA-TAs at The Frame
Breast-themed exhibit is both playful and informative
Boobies. Melons. Twins. Fun Cushions. "TA-TAs." 
That's the title of the newest exhibit to hit The 
Frame, focused on what is arguably the most 
prominent part of the female anatomy. TA-TAs, 
designed by fifth-year architecture majors Nina 
Barbuto and Jenna Kappelt, opened last Friday 
night.
Family, friends, and art lovers milled about the 
exhibit, chatting about the fact that the show 
was, indeed, all about breasts. It's something 
that we both wanted to show in our work, but 
its hard to show in architecture. But at the same 
time, there are still architectural aspects to the 
art," said Barbuto. Everything was planned down 
to the very last detail; even the food took on the 
theme of breasts.
Visitors were invited to take a sip of wine-filled 
bags mounted on the wall, with nipples as taps. 
The walls were also decorated with photos 
and drawings, each showing an element of 
architecture or machinery that took the shape of 
breasts. Bean-bag chairs (with painted nipples) 
faced a looped video of a woman's cleavage 
exploding out of her shirt. Next to the video 
presentation, there was a table with place 
settings in which the bowls, knives, forks, and 
spoons were all in the form of breasts.
Overhead, a canopy of bras netted together 
stretched halfway across the room. "Being in 
architecture, its hard to remove yourself from 
defining spaces," Kappelt said. At least 30 bras 
of different brands, shapes, sizes, colors, and 
styles were hooked together to form the canopy. 
A lot of the bras are ours," she said. We also 
just started asking our friends and people in our 
studios and they donated them.
Creating a border around the entire main room, a 
banner featured Kappelts and Barbuto's breastprints. Neither of the artists was self-conscious 
about this part of the exhibit. For anyone who 
knows us, it's not exposing any more than we 
would in our personal lives, Kappelt said. In 
the other room, whose walls were covered with 
white paper, visitors of either gender had the 
opportunity to contribute their own breast-prints. 
Prints varying in shape and size adorned the 
walls in various colors, peppered with names and 
phrases. Visitors could also put their faces in a 
cutout and be photographed next to a breast.
The awareness wall, the most powerful part of
Jenna Kappelt (left) and Nina Barbuto 
(right) celebrate busting out into the 
art world at the opening night of their 
exhibit at the Frame.
the display, featured graphic images of women in 
various stages of breast cancer, from untreated 
infections to post-chemotherapy. The photos 
were startling illustrations of cancer-ridden 
breasts, flesh eaten away, surgery scars, and 
seemingly normal inflammations gone awry. Most 
people found them so horrible that they couldn't 
help but look on with unwavering stares. You 
hear about breast cancer, but you dont know if 
its really scary," Kappelt said. The artists had 
originally planned to put the photos up against 
a landscape background, but felt that the white 
walls made them stand out and-elicited a greater 
viewer response.
Strategically placed in the center of all the 
pictures were the typical breast examination 
instructions that are available at almost every 
health clinic, but with flair. The hand-illustrated 
tutorial was created in a style similar to that of 
a comic strip. The written instructions were 
simple, lacking the impersonal medical tone. The 
instructions were appropriately titled Touching 
yourself for happier boobs."
Jenna made it fun to touch yourself, explained 
Barbuto. Usually you go to the doctor and get 
the examination instructions and you're like 'Oh,
I don't want to touch myself; these pamphlets 
are boring and weird and in black and white.'
But [you need to] touch yourself because your 
bodys going to hate you if you dont and you get 
cancer.
Breast cancer is a rising epidemic. Over 215,000 
American women get breast cancer every year, 
and worldwide it is the second most fatal cancer 
in women. One in eight women will get breast 
cancer today, up from one in 20 in 1960.
Despite the comedy and occasional awkwardness 
of the topic, both Barbuto and Kappelt made an 
active decision to address a somber topic. The 
artists showed that however funny and playful a 
topic breasts may seem, breast cancer is serious, 
though preventable through awareness and 
vigilance. Its a celebration of breasts, Kappelt 
said, but you can't understand them unless you 
know how you can lose them.

week. A sketch depicted two students chatting 
with the subheading Wilbur just woke up to 
the fact that hes in class! and warned against 
drowsy feelings cramping ones style. Stay mod 
and take your NoDozes  experts say they're 
as safe as cigarettes!
Carnegie Mellon landscapers planted trees in 
an effort to beautify campus. The greenery was 
thought to give a more comfortable feel to the 
previously sparse environment. Unfortunately, 
some of those trees are now being uprooted to 
make room for the Gates Center for Computer 
Science. The good Carnegie Mellon giveth, and 
the good Carnegie Mellon taketh away.
Pittsburgh held a film festival featuring the movie 
Chung King Express. Most viewers reactions 
were positive, although few seemed to get 
it. Such confusion is typical when it comes 
to viewing films from abroad. You know, like 
when you saw Ichi The Killer in McConomy last 
week?
A Tartan cartoonist expressed his rage towards 
The Original Hot Dog Shop by depicting an O 
burger made of feces. Adjacent to the illustration 
was an ad for the O. I guess that was the last 
time they advertised in The Tartan.
A staffwriter commented on Carnegie Mellon 
students' desire to win what had been dubbed 
The Suffering Game. The game consisted of 
peers comparing and complaining about the 
amount of work in their respective majors. The 
rules are simple: whoever sleeps the least wins. 
I dont know what the big deal about this article 
is, since I havent slept in 48 hours and obviously 
my major is harder than anyone else's!

Blackalicious and Andrew Bird perform at CMUs fall concert
Counterclockwise from top right: Audience 
members enjoying the show; Blackalicious's 
' producer, Chief Xcel; Andrew Bird, the 
opening act; Blackalicious MC Gift of Gab.
For weeks, I had been waiting to ask the guys in Blackalicious 
one question: What do you think of modern hip-hop, and how 
do you see yourselves fitting into this structure? Talking to 
the kings of underground hip-hop, I expected  and wanted
 Blackalicious MC Gift of Gab and producer Chief Xcel 
to bash the shameless antics of modern hip-hop, claiming 
Blackalicious itself to be an alternative to mainstream rap.
Chief Xcel said nothing of the sort. "Were 20-year veterans, 
he explained. "I dont even consider us fitting into modern 
hip-hop; we are modern hip-hop. If anything, hip-hop fits into 
us, he boasted. Although his confidence may come across as 
arrogance, it is more a sign of risks taken, innovations made, 
and challenges overcome throughout his career. And from the 
minute the lights dimmed at AB Concerts fall performance 
Friday night, Blackalicious played with the energy, bounce, 
and confidence of true 20-year veterans.
Storming the stage with an infectious flow and a maniacal 
smile between verses, Gift of Gab bobbed, strutted, and 
waved through politically-charged tunes like Paragraph 
President. His voice, building in intensity and tension, finally 
escalated to a scream as he shouted, "I pledge allegiance to 
the pen and the pad and the mic! After a crowd-pleasing 
freestyle from Gab, Xcel pulled out the hard rock-influenced 
"Supreme People. The crowd bobbed their heads in time 
with the ever-thumping backbeat that barreled through the' 
subwoofers and echoed off of Wiegand Gymnasiums ceilings. 
In Your Move," Gift of Gab rapped with Twista speed, Nas 
grit, and Eric Sermon flow. Combined with his own catchy, 
West Coast hook (including the soulful "Youve Got to 
Groove"), Gab created a brilliant mixture of the now-polarized 
music form. In Deception, off 2002s NIA, the crowd joined 
Gift of Gab in humming the chorus' "la-di-da-da-da-di-da in 
not-so-perfect harmony (but blissful nonetheless), bringing 
smiles to long-time Blackalicious fans and newcomers alike.
The climax of the show, though it came earlier than expected, 
was simply fantastic. It happened during "Rhythm Sticks, a 
brooding, eerie track with subtle drum syncopations cracking 
behind Gift of Gab's acronym-based rhymes about the name 
of Blackalicious. Gab got the crowd jumping with hands in 
the air while the beat pounded away, bringing the energy in 
the gymnasium to an impossibly high peak.
"We love playing at colleges," Chief Xcel said backstage 
before the show. It's a naturally creative, thinking, and fertile 
environment. It sure seemed like students here at Carnegie 
Mellon loved them, too.
Despite doubts that the difference in act styles between 
Blackalicious and opener Andrew Bird would cause some 
audience confusion, students were receptive to Bird's 
bizarre, yet creative, live show. With a violin resting on his 
arm, a vintage Gibson electric guitar slung over his shoulder, 
and a glockenspiel at his side, Bird and drummer Martin 
Dosh eased their way through a slew of originals, including 
Skin," a samba-influenced groove with touches of whistling 
and plucked violin. During the shows energetic opener,
A Nervous Tic Motion of the Head to the Left," Bird raked 
double-stops on his violin and Dosh pounded on the drum kit 
with snappy brushes as the crowd bobbed and cheered along.
Of those who knew Bird's records but had never seen him 
live, many were surprised at the discrepancy between his 
recordings and his concerts; Bird is notorious for performing 
songs on stage differently from the way they are on the 
record. Would you rather see a show with people taking 
risks, or playing exactly whats on the record?" asked Bird 
after the show. And even though it seemed at times like he 
could have used a bigger band behind him to add depth to his 
compositions,'Bird enjoyed the liberty of having just him and 
a drummer. It gives me a lot more freedom, and keeps me 
on my toes," he said. Bird definitely seemed to be on his toes 
throughout, laying down bluesy violin lines and then quickly 
switching to guitar riffs. Bird was once a violin performance 
major at Northwestern University, and even now he is far 
more proficient on violin than on any other instrument (voice 
included). Throughout the show, Birds eclectic arsenal of 
music was a step in the right direction for both of the boxedin indie rock and singer-songwriter genres.
Even though ticket sales Werent up to par with last year's 
fall concert (the gym was only slilghtly over half filled), Friday 
night's show was a "success for AB Concerts and also CMU, 
according to AB Concerts co-president, Eileen Angulo, a 
junior psychology major. She added, We may not have had 
a sold-out show, but when four-fifths of the tickets sold go to 
CMU students who are moved enough out of their element 
to dance, jump, and even scream at a concert, we've done 
our job. Agreed. Now, onto Spring Carnival... Arcade Fire, 
anyone?

Emerging from the darkness: The Haunted returns with The Dead Eye
From Birmingham to Belo Horizonte, metal has evolved 
from its primal roots and created many different 
subgenres. Thrash, death, prog, grind, and many other 
classifications populate the conscious of the metal fan 
today. (For a good rundown, check out the excellent 
anthropological documentary Metal: A Headbanger's 
Journey.) Bands that start off in one subgenre can 
successfully transition their style to another; Carcass' 
progression from grind to thrashy death metal is a good 
example. Not all bands are able to pull it off, but I believe 
that The Haunted's latest could be a work of transitional 
genius.
Gothenburg is a pivotal stop on the world tour of our 
beloved genre's evolution. Swedish death metal is 
responsible for much of what is coming out of America 
today. Bands are encouraged by the success of At The 
Gates to incorporate melody along with razor-sharp 
guitar work. I would even go so far as to say that the 
technical level of guitar players here improved because 
that band set the bar so high. Sadly, the U.S. didnt 
get to see too much of ATG before its break-up, but 
out of the ashes of that band came others, notably The 
Haunted.
Beyond musicianship, what set The Haunted apart was 
the ability of its singer to infuse an eerie uneasiness into 
his vocals. Something about Peter Dolving's delivery  
his spoken word interludes  can make a persons skin 
crawl. Dolving communicates his rants on humanitys 
sickness with the tone of a serial killer. It made me pay 
attention from beginning to end, and for a whole year 
it was my wake-up music, my gym music, and my 
right-before-going-out music. The debut was that good. 
Like most great bands, The Haunteds first album was 
a huge success that couldn't be topped. Dolving left 
and Marco Aro (Face Down) took his place, resulting in 
a couple solid albums. When Aro returned to Sweden, 
and eventually to Face Down, the remaining members 
of The Haunted shocked everyone by picking Dolving to 
once again take up the vocalist's position.
It was a reunion that many thrash-metal fans had 
wanted for years. Dolving, as I said before, has that je 
ne sais quoi that separates him from other vocalists.
The reunion album, 1EVOLVE1, was well thought-out 
and well received. The only sad part about the whole 
endeavor is that Dolvings return to America was on the 
Damageplan tour of 2004, which saw "Dimebag" Darrell 
Abbott murdered on stage. As the cycle for that album 
ended, the band returned to Sweden and planned its 
next move.
The next move has turned out to be The Dead Eye, a 
slightly confusing album from one of the leaders of the 
field. Starting off with the aptly titled The Premonition," 
the album kicks into The Flood," which is standard 
Haunted fare. "The Flood" segues into clean vocals
 and the trademark eerie delivery that Dolving has 
mastered  before returning to a harsher sound. All 
along, the rest of the band plays with a precision that 
reflects a hard-won maturity. "The Medication is 
further evidence of The Haunted's evolution. Following
its path tangentially, the thought would be that The 
Dead Eye will be what catapults the band into that next 
level alongside Slayer.
The mystique is there, the talent is obvious, and all 
that separates The Haunted from large-scale fanatical 
devotion is clear, consistent arrangement. Songs like 
"The Fallout seesaw between singing and screaming, 
synth and drum machine, and the result makes me 
want to press "next" on my iPod every time I listen to 
this album. I look to The Haunted to reflect the sickness 
of modern society, to mirror the latent frustration that 
we all share, and perhaps to arouse us from that sleepy 
state in which we often find ourselves. Their first album 
did that. To a point, so did rEVOLVEr.
The Dead Eye builds on that history to a large extent, 
but it goes further. There are fresh riffs here, personal 
lyrics, and with repeated listening, the genius of the 
work really comes through. All bands evolve, and none 
can hope to maintain the fan base and momentum 
of its largest success. Still, what The Haunted was 
able to achieve with its debut  that immediacy that 
grabbed you through the speakers  has been replaced 
with a work that takes many listenings to appreciate. 
With Dolving back in the band, The Haunted has 
the capability to put out albums that shake the core 
of metal. I think the next album will be the one that 
cements the band in the mainstream of metal, making 
them true stars in America.
Before I go, please come out to support live metal here 
in the Burgh: Check out Norma Jean, Misery Signals, 
and the rest of the Radio Rebellion tour at Club Zoo on 
November 26. (Its a Sunday, so go!) Also, Sworn Enemy 
returns to Western Pennsylvania in the next few weeks
 more on them soon.
Until next time,
Up the irons!

Before you go-go
In all my preparation to study abroad in Switzerland this semester,, 
one thing I did not figure out was how often the soundtrack of 
my travels would come to the forefront. From the first exhausted 
step into my temporary home, I began to see American music in a 
completely different light. I was shocked  nay, disgusted  by the 
popularity of the breathy voice of Paris Hilton when I first turned on 
the TV. MTV Europe is one of three channels in English we get in our 
apartment. I thought I was in serious trouble, musically speaking... 
but it hasnt been that bad.
Shortly after I moved in, a town festival blasted 2 Live Crew only 
a street down from the Beatles, with the Swiss drunkenly milling . 
about and mumbling heavily accented lyrics to Pop that Pussy and 
Yesterday. Aloha Night" at a local club promoted American surf 
music," which turned out to be wedding reception favorites like The 
Twist together with some stranger selections: Johnny Cashs Ring 
of Fire mixed into Justin Timberlake. Even on the bus, I can usually 
pick up the faint sounds of Beyonce or The Killers leaking out of the 
headphones of at least one fellow rider.
My favorite encounter with American pop music thus far has been 
in Hamburg, Germany. I had the intriguing opportunity to go to a 
karaoke bar, where 1 heard a passionate medley of Elvis tunes sung 
in a faux-American accent. That same night, I witnessed reasonably 
sober grown men singing along to the Backstreet Boys without 
any shame. (I sang along to ABBA, but that hardly counts; they're 
Swedish.) A day later, i witnessed an extraordinarily amusing German 
hip-hop show, which, suffice it to say, deserves its own article.
Fortunately for me, the pervasiveness of American pop music 
here has been an advantage. My classmates know the perfect 
pronunciation of promiscuous thanks to Nelly Furtado, and they can 
drop it like its hot with the best of them. Getting away with listening 
to Justin Timberlake for the past three months has been fun, but it 
isnt enough to satisfy my ironic hipster tendencies for much longer.
I have to switch to something more disgustingly infectious to amuse 
myself, and Wham! is climbing up my Most Played list in Tunes.
Ive got to cleanse my system and return to the too-cool U.S. of A. 
where this musical sacrilege isnt tolerated on a regular basis  and 
listen to some 80s-inspired indie remixes in somebodys basement, 
stat.

Sirius-ly a hit
Satellite radio attracts listeners
Dont touch that dial! With satellite radio, finding stations 
that cater to specific tastes is easy. Sirius Satellite Radio has 
almost 200 channels, many of which are specialized. Channel 
13, Elvis Radio, is just one example. Its all King, all the time.
The number of subscribers to satellite radio has jumped 
from 28,000 in 2001 to more than 11.3 million in 2006, 
according to a July 20 article on CNN.com. Keep in mind 
that one subscriber usually means two listeners," added , 
Steve Blatter, senior vice-president of music programming at 
Sirius. Though XM Satellite Radio is its largest competitor, 
the strongest effort at Sirius is to attract listeners from 
"terrestrial" radio  the new industry lingo for AM and FM 
radio.
Gone are the days of desperately trying to find reception for 
a hip-hop station in the middle of Mississippi. Now, with 
satellite radio, listeners can enjoy their favorite music at any 
location  without interruption. "[Satellite radio] is able 
to provide to consumers a solution to local radio's biggest 
problem; namely, commercials, Blatter said. According to
Blatter, Sirius' 69 commercial-free music channels inspire 
many listeners to switch from terrestrial radio.
Satellite radio also can get away with more than terrestrial 
radio because were packaging radio tailored to specific 
markets," said Blatter. This means that satellite radio can give 
new bands an opportunity to be heard by a wider audience. 
Sirius has an entire station devoted to new rock that plays 
new and unsigned bands. Mixing mainstream and new 
music on one of its Top-20 stations, XM also does its part to 
give exposure to upcoming artists.
However, there are some drawbacks. Our DJs ... really like 
mixing genres in their shows, in contrast to satellite carving 
things up into tiny little boxes," said Alex Smith, general 
manager of CMU radio station WRCT. Smith's opinion is 
representative of much of the terrestrial scene. Additionally, 
many believe that satellite radio lacks the personal touch of 
terrestrial radio. "Outside of music, satellite certainly isn't 
covering locally produced Pittsburgh talk shows or Tartan 
sports events, Smith said.
Patricia Smith: An American poet
Visiting writer addresses sex, Katrina, and childhood
She runs in and sneaks to her seat against a wall in the front" 
of the recently reananged Maggie Murph Cafe as if hoping 
to be unnoticed, possibly as an attendee of her own reading. 
However, Patricia Smith  a four-time individual champion 
of the National Poetry Slam  is unlikely to remain hidden in 
any room for long.
She takes the podium, starting slowly. She introduces the 
first poem she will read to her packed corner of Hunt Library. 
Its the poem she always reads first, inspired by Nicole, a 
sixthgrade student who wanted to be taught poetry so she 
could write about her mother, who died only a week before. 
And as the reading begins, she erupts into a different person.
As the glasses come off, she becomes the characters in the 
poems she reads: the children she teaches, older men she 
honors, victims of Katrina, younger and older versions of 
herself. Smith moves the audience from smiles to laughter 
both in her poetry and through conversation. She says, "We 
are having a party for her [Smith's granddaughter] where 
everyone has to wear red," to celebrate her transformation 
into a woman, the lead-up to a poem chronicling the blood of 
a woman throughout her life.
Her poems tell the stories of America: scenes of reality told 
through the voices of those who are living it. As the evening 
continues, the,conversation is spotted with poetry, which 
is itself sprinkled with rhythmic screaming. Her eyes are 
squeezed shut as she opens her mouth into an expanse 
that beats into the microphone. The energy rises until she 
announces: "I am not going right into the masturbation poem 
after that."

So after a brief pause she recites the evenings centerpiece, 
a poem describing her experiences with self-pleasuring, in
which she mentions the world record for multiple orgasms in 
an hour. A young man in the crowd with a dark grey Adidas 
asks, "Do you have that womans number?" Displaying the 
wit of a poet trained to act in front of'a live audience, Smith 
replies quickly: He is trying to get her digits! She dont need 
you." The crowd rises up with a chorus of schoolgirl giggles.
From here the subject matter shifts toward the serious. Smith 
performs a series of five poems about the impact of Hurricane 
Katrina on New Orleans. These best illustrate her ability to 
represent a variety of characters: from her portrait of Ethel 
Freeman, the 91-year-old woman who  left dead in her 
wheelchair  became an image of the poorly handled relief 
effort, to her 34-verse memorial for the 34 residents left to 
drown at St. Ritas Nursing Home. While the devastation of 
Katrina has become a popular device for many artists, Smith 
brings to her poetry a characterization which truly defines her 
work, impassioning the audience as she moves through her 
thoughts on Hurricane Katrina, the blood dazzler.
Smith ends the evening with a description of her relationship 
with her father before reading Hot Water Cornbread," a 
narrative recollection of his presence ir\her childhood, of 
his teaching her to cook as they danced in the kitchen to 
the disapproval of her mother. He asked her that, when she 
became a famous writer, she mention the evenings they spent 
together. As the words of her poem dance between his death 
and their culinary lessons together, she creates one more 
portrait of humanity in this bittersweet closing, honoring her 
fathers inspirational request.

Regardless of the arguments for or against it, satellite radio 
has one market it has yet to conquer: college students. Smith 
said, It seems to me that people are more drawn to Internet 
radio as opposed to satellite, at least around CMUs campus." 
This is something that XM and Sirius hope to change. Both 
companies have Internet radio companies that are free with 
subscription to satellite radio. By itself, the Internet radio the 
companies offer can cost at least $7.99 a month.
Despite the new Internet radio companies, satellite radio 
seems to have a long way to go to win over the college 
demographic. But right now, conquering higher education 
is a low priority. "Radio fell into the hands of people who 
completely forgot about the human touch, said Sirius 
programmer Meg Griffin in Rolling Stone. They wrecked it. 
And now were un-wrecking it.

Odissi by Operajita
CFA speaker revives ancient form of dance,
Dha Dhin Dhin na ... the small drums beat. Enter Oopali 
Operajita. A virtuoso of the Indian classical dance styles of 
Odissi and Bharatnatyam, Operajita performed in CFA's Kresge 
Theatre this past Thursday.
The dance form Odissi is well over 2000 years old, with 
ancient temple sculptures mirroring its smooth curves. Odissi 
is famous for its aesthetically enticing postures, such as the 
tribhanga.
Recently, Odissi was revived by the late guru Kelucharan 
Mohapatra, and the standard dances of Odissi repertoire are 
mostly choreographed by him. Meera Das, a student of the 
late guru and winner of many prestigious dancing awards, 
understands the reason Operajita chose to share Odissi in 
America. Das wrote in an e-mail that dancers "wish to share 
with the world the incomparable beauty and richness of Odissi 
dance. She also teaches students Odissi in Cuttack, Orissa; 
and says that every Odissi teacher's goal is the same: "to 
take Odissi dance and music to a pinnacle not glimpsed or 
imagined so far."
Operajita studied under Mohapatra during her adolescent 
years in Orissa, the home of Odissi. He was so pleased with 
her dancing that he chose to cast her beside him in the lead 
female role of one of his dance dramas. From there, Operajitas 
career took off.
Operajita's dancing career has earned her international 
acclaim; shes received awards and recognition from the U.S.
and Canada, in addition to her home country of India. In fact, 
her 1996 performance at Carnegie Mellons Rangos Ballroom 
was voted one of the top 10 classical dance performances by 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Despite Operajitas devotion to Odissi, she has managed 
to make time to formalize her education and raise a family. 
Operajita's business card labels her as a politician and 
choreographer. After obtaining her M.A. from Delhi University 
and an MAPW (similar to an MBA in writing, communication 
planning, and design), Operajita embarked on a career 
separate from dance. She now works as an advisor to Naveen 
Jindal, a member of the Indian Parliament.
Operajita began her concert with the traditional 
Manglachaian, which translates to "invocation. The 
Manglachaian sets the stage for the rest of the dance. 
Typically, a dancer begins by choosing one deity and paying 
him or her obeisance through dance. Operajita skillfully 
showed her abhinaya, allowing her to tell a story through her 
emotions and eye positions.
After heiManglacharan, Operajita moved on to a pure dance 
item called pallavi, or elaboration. In this type of dance, the 
performer takes a simple line  in this case Ta re jhum
 and adds more beats to it until it evolves from slow, bodybending positions to quick, intricate steps. Operajita's pallavi, 
performed in the raag (melodic style) of Shanktabaianam, was 
only half finished before she ended. But even an incomplete 
version of the dance revealed a varied combination of steps
along a beat, typical of Indian classical dance.
It is one thing to master an art form, but to teach it to others 
is another skill entirely. Operajita's reputation comes from 
having that ability Performing in front of an audience that 
knew little about Odissi, Operajita decided to preface her 
last dance with a bit of tutelage; she offered a slideshow 
explaining the originals of Odissis many postures. 
Meanwhile, Operajita demonstrated certain postures herself, 
such as the chowk position, which imitates the position of an 
Odissi perfomances presiding deity, Jagannatha.
Operajita finally ended the event with an abhinaya piece, 
which is her specialty. In it she depicted the legend of Radha 
and Krishna  Radha sits in wait for her Krishna to come 
anoint her with sandalwood paste and dress her in gossamer 
and garlands.
Though Odissi sometimes seems like a neglected art form 
in America, performers like Operajita are part of the effort 
to revive it. Her gift to the attendees, a heightened cultural 
awareness, is perpetuated with a few drumbeats and the 
distant jingling of ankle bells.

"The only other option was a basement show at some 
punk house.
The Mr. Roboto Project provides an alternative to 
commercialized music and commercialized venues. 
"They'll never be on MTV, but they sure as hell 
wouldn't want to be," said Briselli. "if the community 
loses interest, then we cease to serve a real function. 
With stable funds, a strong membership, and even 
tentative plans for expansion, the success of the Mr. 
Roboto Project reflects its significance in Pittsburgh.
French existentialists, hippies, hip-hop emcees, graffiti 
artists, punks. Although these alternative.cultures each 
represented a minority in their respective heydays, 
their effects on society are clear. Alternative cultures 
have taken on many different ideals, structures, and 
memberships over time and continue to leave marks 
on contemporary life.
Pre-Roboto, small bands playing music drastically 
different from Top 40 pop were forced to perform 
illegally at basement shows, if at all. The Mr. Roboto 
Project provides an alternative to the bureaucracy 
of larger corporation-driven venues as well as the 
unreliability of house shows. "This way were legit 
but still do it our way. You dont have to worry about 
getting shut down by the police, Briselli said.
Alternative cultures are so called because they provide 
alternatives to popular or mainstream culture. They 
form when a society isnt able to provide for the needs 
and desires of all of its people. "In the late 90s there 
was no consistent venue for punk-hardcore-indie 
shows, said Mike "Q Roth, one of the creators of the 
Mr. Roboto Project, an important part of alternative 
culture in Pittsburgh.

Like Roboto, The Big Idea Infoshop provides a space 
for alternative media. Instead of music, The Big Idea 
focuses on radical literature, both in books and in 
magazines. It started out selling books by tabling at 
festivals and events, including shows at the Mr. Roboto 
Project. The Big Idea now operates out of a store in 
Bloomfield  about a 10-minute bus ride from campus.
Among the core values of the Mr. Roboto Project are 
community involvement and democratic control," 
Roth explained. Thus, Roboto is run as a cooperative. 
Members buy an initial $15 share in the organization 
and pay a $10 membership fee every year. Membership 
comes with discounted ticket prices for shows at 
Roboto and the freedom to rent the space for concerts 
or as practice space. In general, the direction the 
space takes is up to the membership, said Briselli. 
Members can vote on issues at monthly meetings and 
annually vote to elect the board of directors.
Theyll never be on MTV, but they sure as hell 
wouldnt want to be.
The Mr. Roboto Project, a small storefront in nearby 
Wilkinsburg, is a venue used mainly for musical 
performances. Roboto primarily hosts punk and 
hardcore bands, although members of the project are 
welcome to use space for any category of event or 
performance.
Ever since its inception in 2001, The Big Idea has 
been the only store of its kind able to succeed in 
Pittsburgh. There was a huge need for something like 
this: a radical bookstore venue for getting out these 
ideas, said Nathan Iverson, a.volunteer and financial 
coordinator at The Big Idea. We provide a lot of access 
to independent publishers, to local writers, and a lot 
of radical thought that doesn't get any shelf space 
anywhere else.
Robotos do-it-yourself (DIY) mentality can be 
attributed in part to the DIY imperative of the 70s 
and '80s punk movement. A proactive approach 
encouraged artists to create their own record labels 
and venues; it also provided an escape from the control 
of mainstream influences. In our society we are taught 
to be passive consumers of just about everything,"
Roth said. For us, Roboto is one way of... taking back 
control of our music scene.
Since its creation in 1999, Roboto has been a home to 
alternative music culture. The idea arose from the need 
for legitimate venues to accommodate non-mainstream 
bands. "Back when Roboto was first being created, if 
you wanted to do a show at a big space you had to go 
through a professional promoter and agents and all that 
stuff," said Jennifer Briselli, the secretary and public
In the store, you can find anarchist literature, queer 
literature, and books on environmental and labor issues 
that aren't sold at any chain bookstores. I kind of 
see it as a safe place for people to come and explore

providing an alternative to motor vehicle transportation 
but also an alternative to capitalist consumerism by 
offering bikes and repairs free of charge.
We want a bigger space and more freedom.
In Pittsburgh, as in most metropolitan areas, 
opportunities to escape mainstream culture are 
available. Besides musical, literary, and transportationbased subcultures, Pittsburgh is also home to 
alternative cultures of vegetarians and vegans, 
independent media reporting, and centers of radical 
political thought that serve not only as alternatives but 
as platforms for resistance.
Motivated groups like the Mr. Roboto Project, The Big 
Idea Infoshop, and Free Ride proactively organize to 
fill the gaps left in society by popular culture. These 
groups provide more than just resources: They provide 
support. The Big Idea offers copies of Alexander 
Berkmans ABCs of Anarchism, but whats even more 
important is the community of people eager to discuss 
it. We want a bigger space and more freedom, 
Manheim said. "(Alternative culture] is being part of a 
group of people that are all interested in sharing this 
kind of experience."

search of recycled building supplies. According to 
its mission statement, Free Ride aims to "enhance 
the health of our community and environment by 
promoting active living and encouraging bicycle 
transportation. The pro-bicycling organization is, like 
The Big Idea, non-profit and run largely by volunteers 
(although there are a few paid employees).
Free Ride also follows a DIY ideology: volunteer 
mechanics teach people how to repair or even build 
their own bikes. Instead of paying for these services, 
those helped are asked to contribute to Free Ride 
by doing some volunteering of their own. The time 
volunteered is typically used dismantling the donated 
bikes that we dont want to circulate parts around the 
shop," said Free Ride volunteer Elijah Matheny.
Free Ride provides the Pittsburgh community with 
alternatives to fossil-fuel-burning transportation. This 
is playing a larger and more important role in how a 
city is going to be able to function. Bicycling basically 
is non-polluting and were recycling bikes, so we 
don't even support the industry that makes bikes," 
Matheny said. Free Ride is helping to create a more 
environmentally sustainable city, despite the presence 
of vehicles that bum pollutants in today's mainstream 
culture.
Free Ride is also an alternative to spending money on 
transportation. The more free things, the better, said 
Matheny. People can have transportation for free and 
dont have to drive in cars that are horribly destroying 
the earth. This allows people of all cultures and classes 
to have bikes. In this sense, Free Ride is not only

some ideas that they wouldnt get exposed to in other 
bookstores that are around, especially in Pittsburgh, 
said Marisa Manheim, another volunteer.
The Big Idea has managed to keep its doors open 
despite the challenge of maintaining a business that 
is both independent and radical. There was a store 
in South Side that carried a lot of queer authors and 
that closed down a couple years ago, Iverson said. In 
the face of huge booksellers, The Big Idea is able to 
survive because of its alternative business ethics. In a 
pamphlet available in the store, The Big Idea defines 
its business practices as following an anarchist 
model. The pamphlet defines the cooperative as "a 
working example of an alternative to capitalism, the 
hierarchical workplace, and wage labor, The store 
is run entirely by unpaid volunteers, and all profits 
generated are used to maintain the space and buy 
books.
As with Roboto, The Big Idea involves all volunteers 
in decisions concerning everything from day-to-day 
operation to placing orders. Volunteers dont pay for 
memberships; instead, they contribute their time and 
ideas. We actively try to make everyone involved a 
decision-maker in the process, Iverson said. "We're 
nicer than the people that work at Borders."
The more free things, the better.
Free Ride is another organization that follows the 
philosophy of the Mr. Roboto Project. Its primary : 
location is now at Construction Junction in Point 
Breeze, a mecca for home improvement DIY-ers in

Enlist: Only your identity will be sacrificed
Bertolt Brechts Man is Man explores yesterdays propaganda machine through a modem lens
Recruitment rather than relaxation framed either side of the 
performance of Bertolt Brechts drama Man is Man. Calls 
for new recruits came at the beginning and end of the play, 
urging audience members to. step on stage at any time if they 
felt the need to join up.
Before the play began, audience members sat on wooden 
benches of all shapes and sizes and watched the actors 
apply makeup and perform warm-up exercises. If you 
were expecting a play that allowed you to lose yourself in 
the setting, you were wrong. The actors, all junior drama 
majors, prepared for the show while sitting on crates inside 
cubbyholes. Powder, cloth scraps, and water bottles were 
abundant, enabling the audience to see the students 
transform into soldiers before their eyes.
When the play began with a song urging the audience to 
join the army and see the world, one thing was made certain: 
Civilians were looked down upon.
Brecht's work did not originally include musical numbers, 
but director Kathleen Amshoff asked cunent drama graduate 
student Chris Diamond and Michael Kooman, a graduate of 
the music composition program, to collaborate on a few songs 
for the piece. "The songs and the frame at the very beginning 
and end are the only 'contemporary moments' in the play, 
said Amshoff, referring to recruitment calls surrounding the 
body of the performance.
Though it was hard for audience members to suspend any 
disbelief while seated less than 10 feet from the actors, 
the venue itself was an excellent choice. Man is Man was 
performed at the Sage Room on Fifth Avenue, a former 
childrens clothing store. All the players were dressed in dirty 
uniforms or ragged civilian clothing, and the venue gave the 
appearance of something old and worn as well.
Amshoff fought hard to secure the venue, which is about to 
be torn down. "It had everything we needed," she said of the
space, which included old rolling ladders and a large wall full 
of wooden shelves. The entire feeling of the venue enforced 
the roughness, the dirtiness, and the even the directness of 
the subject matter.
Man is Man tells the story of a porter named Gayly Gay (Sean 
Hamrin) who  according to his wife  cannot say no. One 
day Gay goes out, innocently enough, to buy a fish and is 
coerced into posing as a soldier by a ragtag group of machine 
gunners who have lost the fourth member of their unit. From 
the moment Gay is introduced to the gunners, he starts to fall 
away from who he once was.
Tim Israel, a drama junior who served as a dramaturg for 
the play, explained that Brecht originally wrote Man is Man 
as a celebration of socialism. Israel said, He was looking to 
mobilize the masses; he was looking to celebrate that a person 
can be reconstituted to fit in with the masses." After the Nazis 
gained power, Brecht rewrote the play as a condemnation of 
conformity, Israel explained.
The play, adapted by Amshoff from the original, devotes most 
of its time to exploring how Gay changes after spending time 
with the machine gun soldiers. At first, Gay is devoted to a 
pregnant wife (played by Allison Byrnes) and eager to return 
home. But the friendship of the soldiers influences him so 
much that when Mrs. Gay inquires after him at the army 
canteen, her husband pretends not to recognize her so that 
the soldiers wont be punished for losing a man. By the plays 
end, Gay no longer even knows who he is.
It is a negative view of the military," said Amshoff of the 
play. I really wanted to keep emphasizing to people in the 
production that to me the military was a metaphor for any 
institution that demands conformity."
Israel viewed the play in its present adaptation as an attack 
on propaganda more so than the military. "If were being 
radical its because we feel within our right in this current
atmosphere of bumper-sticker slogans.... You can slap a 
sticker on your car and feel that you've done your job."
Whether it condemns the military or not, the play spends 
considerable space exploring the theme of identity. Towards 
the end, one of the machine gunners, Uriah (Dusty Alvarado), 
sinisterly begins to suggest that there are several stages to 
removing a man from his identity. In these darkly humorous 
scenes, the machine gunners trick Gay into buying a fake 
elephant and then put him on trial for attempting to sell it.
While Gay is being transformed into a permanent fourth 
man for the machine-gun unit, the commander of the 
troops, Bloody 5 (Jarid Faubel), is experiencing the opposite 
transition. Faubel was excellent in both his roles, one as 
Bloody 5 and the other as Wang, the guardian of a pagoda.
It is through Bloody 5 that we see the mirror to Gay's story: 
Fallen from his position as a feared leader, Bloody 5 is beaten 
and ridiculed by his own men when his "desires get the 
better of him. (When it rains, Bloody 5 is taken over by the 
desire for female company.)
Though Amshoff said she made cuts to the end of the play, 
the performance lost momentum under the weight of its 
rhetoric and started to drag. It sparkled best in its moments of 
humor, such as when the machine-gun unit gets stuck in tar 
while stealing from the pagoda. Despite the slower pace of the 
plays second half, there couldnt have been a more ideal time 
to watch a play about the dangers of a military state than the 
week of the 2006 midterm elections.
The play was overly heavy-handed in its attempt to caution, 
but perhaps that was the intent. "It's provocation in whatever 
way, said Amshoff, "We really want, more than anything, 
discussion."

Smokeout or smoke less?S'
Campus group supports kicking the habit
The objective of CMU Smokeout, a, new anti-smoking group 
on campus, is to raise awareness about the environmental, 
political, and health-related effects of smoking. The groups 
actions, however, go a step further. CMU Smokeout has been 
working to assist Student Health Services in Healthy Campus 
2010, a national initiative designed to make participating 
college campuses smoke-free by the end of the decade.
Healthy Campus 2010, a program designed by the American 
College Health Association, "establishes national college 
health objectives and serves as a basis for developing plans to 
improve student health," according to its website.
Eliminating smoking is just one of the program's initiatives. 
According to CMU Smokeout president Jared Ross, a senior 
chemistry major, Healthy Campus 2010 is "a comprehensive 
solution  not just a ban on smoking." Instead of just 
prohibiting smoking on campus, Healthy Campus 2010 also 
intends to raise awareness about the dangers of tobacco, 
provide smoking cessation programs, and stop campus
vendors such as Entropy from selling tobacco products. The" 
organizers of this initiative are starting with small changes, 
such as moving ashtrays farther away from buildings.
According to CMU Smokeout vice-president Alisa Brown, a 
senior psychology major, information and support for those 
interested in quitting are already available at Carnegie 
Mellon. "Student Health Services offers counseling, as does 
the American Cancer Society," she said. Highmark, an 
insurance provider that offers the Carnegie Mellon health 
plan, even offers monetary incentives to those who are willing 
to quit smoking.
"Did you know that $75.5 billion per year of the government's 
money goes to health care costs for smoking-related 
illnesses? asked Ross. "Doesnt that seem like a huge burden 
for taxpayers?
Regardless of the reasons for not smoking, any program that 
intends to eliminate smoking from our campus will receive
backlash from the smoking community. "Yeah, it's harsh to 
ban smoking, but everybody agrees that its bad for you, 
said Brown. Even all of the opposition doesnt really make 
an argument for the benefits of smoking, but rather, that 
eliminating smoking is destroying our freedom of choice.
Ross and Brown want to make it clear that CMU Smokeout 
is not anti-smoking or putting forth any political views; 
the primary goal is to help people who want to quit but 
cant. CMU Smokeout also intends to work with outside 
organizations such as Highmark, bring in speakers, and open 
the lines of communication about the impending Healthy 
Campus initiative.

a hard act to follow.
Justin Brown | Assistant Photo Editor

combined voice, violin, and even a glockenspiel to set the mood for 
the rest of the show.
