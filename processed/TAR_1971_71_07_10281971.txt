State's College Editors Vote On Priorities
In case you might from time to 
time fail to appreciate the editor of 
the TARTAN, he has, this week, 
included some snippetts of the 
trash written by other collegiate 
editors, and the results of a prior
its poll in which they engaged.
Though the editor naturally did 
not engage in the voting, he does
offer an analysis of its results, that 
being that the only participant 
with any brains was Margaret 
McCarvill of Villanova University. 
Margaret pointed out that colle
giate editors dont know anything, 
and is to be commended for her
The Pittsburgh Peace and Free
dom Center is currently organizing 
buses and car caravans to transport 
hundreds of people from CMU and 
the Pittsburgh area to Cleveland on 
November 6th for the mass anti
war demonstration scheduled to 
take place there on that day. This 
action is one of a series of demon
strations occuring in 17 major 
cities on November 6th.
The demonstrations are being 
jointly sponsored by the National 
Peace Action Coalition and the 
Peoples Coalition for Peace and 
Justice and will reflect the broad
est base of opposition to the war in 
this country to date-.
The most significant aspect of 
the support generated for Novem
ber 6th is the entry of the labor 
movement into the organized 
anti-war effort. This is a trend 
which began after the May 70 stu
dent strike and which first began 
to really develop around the build
ing for the April 24th march on 
Washington. In organized labor the 
anti-war movement has more than 
a powerful ally. The working 
people of American represent a 
powerthe only powerwhich 
can actually end the war. The 
November 6th demonstrations are 
the first anti-war actions which the 
labor movement has taken a really 
big part in building.
NPAC has been circulating an 
Open Letter to Trade Unionists 
on the Wage Freeze and the War. 
The letter is signed by 160 union 
leaders and relates the wage freeze 
to the war-caused inflation, urging 
workers to march against the war
insight.
What follows is a Pennsylvania 
Collegiate Press Association report 
on how the editors rate the Top 
30 problems and the Top 30 
non-problems of America today:
Pollution environmental 
health received the most votes for 
the second straight year in a survey 
of Pennsylvania collegiate editors 
to determine the greatest prob
lems and challenges facing Amer
ica today.
Fifteen of the 25 editors voted 
for Pollution in the poll conducted
on November 6th. The Minnesota 
and Washington, D.C. AFL-CIOs 
have recently passed resolutions 
calling for immediate withdrawal 
from Indochina.
In the Cleveland area labor par
ticipation has been the decisive 
factor in building for the demon
stration. Over 20 local union 
leaders have given their endorse
ment and are actively building the 
action. In addition, Local 1746 of 
the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees, 
UAW Local 1045, district 7 of the 
United Electrical Workers and 
Local 427 of the Amalgamated 
Meat Cutters and Butcher Work
men of North America have 
endorsed as unions and will be 
marching behind their own ban
ners in the demonstration. Thou
sands of workers will be marching 
in Cleveland and across the coun
try on November 6th.
The participation of organized 
labor in the November 6th actions 
is a direct result of the consistent 
work the student anti-war move
ment has carried out in the past. 
Students, many of whom have 
been marching against the war for 
years, no longer have to feel alone. 
But students will have an impor
tant role to play and a massive 
student turnout on the 6th will be 
necessary to ensure the effective
ness of the demonstrations.
With the vast majority of the 
American people against the war it 
is no longer as much a question of 
convincing people the war is wrong 
as it is convincing people that they 
have the power to end the war and
by the Pennsylvania Collegiate 
Press Association. Race Relations, 
Wage and Price Controls, and Wel
fare Policies tied for second-place 
with nine votes each.
Editors dropped the Vietnam 
Wara close second in 1970to 
fifth-place this year with eight 
votes. Race Relations moved up a 
notch from its third-place 1970 
rank.
Each editor was given a fist of 
30 items and asked to check the 
five areas they considered most 
important and the five areas they 
considered least important.
mobilizing them to action. The 
November 6th demonstrations are 
a major step in building a move
ment which will involve millions of 
people and which can literally 
force an end to the war.
Bus tickets are $6.00 round 
trip. If you would like to reserve a 
seat, would like to help or simply 
get more information call Peace 
and Freedom Center at 362-9000 
between 3 and 6 PM. An infor
mation and ticket table will also be 
set up in Baker Hall the week be
fore the demonstration.
Invites Shoplifting
According to the manager of 
the CMU bookstore, an estimated 
2% to 3% of its total sales is stolen. 
This amounts to about $14,000 or 
$15,000 a year.
Mr. Charles Floyd, manager of 
the bookstore, noted that these 
figures have remained constant for 
the last few years and that they are 
no better or worse than the re
ported figures of other on-campus 
bookstores.
Mr. Floyd also noted that the 
biggest dollar loss in stolen mer
chandise is that lost on stolen text
books. He said that this was so 
simply because textbooks are 
expensive and that every student 
has to have them. Other items fre
quently stolen are film and small, 
hard to mark supplies.
When asked if there were any 
way to stop theft, Mr. Floyd said
Pornography (20) and General 
Morality and Religions Decline 
(15 each) ranked 1-2 among the 
areas considered least important 
by the editors. Religions Decline 
and Pornography were 1-2 in
1970.
Seven problem areas not on the 
list were cited by the editors: revi
sion of current draft system and 
the 18-year-old vote; organized 
crime; ending the draft; govern
ment spending; school policies and 
administration especially in state 
and community colleges; judicial 
system decline;aid to cities.

that all he could do was keep an 
alert staff and remind students 
that strong disciplinary action will 
be taken against those who are 
caught.
He mentioned that the present 
layout and location of the book
store invites shoplifting, and hopes 
that when the addition to Skibo is 
built, it will include a properly de
signed bookstore.
Losses in textbook inventory 
do not now threaten the standard 
10% textbook discount.
Mr. Floyd noted that several 
other campus bookstores have 
resorted to over-the-counter sales 
in order to cut theft rates and 
maintain the 10% textbook dis
count. Carnegie-Mellons book
store has been self-service since 
1948, and has no plans of going to

Editor's Note
Real cute. Here I am, a junior in 
the wopping new College of Hu
manities and Social Sciences, with 
$6,000 already invested in a col
lege degree, and I find out that the 
chairman of the admissions com
mittee at Yale Law School feels a 
credit/no entry grade. . . really 
amounts to the equivalent of no 
grade at all.
Here I am, planning to invest 
another $4,000 of poppas money 
into my very own credit/ no entry 
college degree, and the director of 
the University of Pittsburgh Law 
School says of credit/no entry gra
ding; we dont know how to take 
it; generally, we just pass right over 
it.
Just pass right over it! Howd I 
do? According to my computa
tion: $ 10,000 + 4 years = one puz
zled admissions director -+the 
equivalent of no grade at all-one 
credit/no entry B A. in English =0.
I think I blew it.
Well, where did I go wrong? 
First of all, I failed to recognize 
what every decent graduate school 
in the world recognizes: mainly, 
that not only is the typical college 
undergraduate one of natures 
least imaginative and uninspired 
creatures, but that it is without 
doubt unequalled by any other 
creature in its lack of motivation.
Consequently, during my first 
two years here I swallowed all that 
avant-garde academic tripe about 
an education without grades, an
education in which you compete 
only with yourself. I like the idea, 
it presents an ideal situation, it de
scribes true education; but true 
education requires true students, 
students who are disciplined, dedi
cated scholars, not the intellectual 
dabblers and academic hedonists 
that we are.
So dont talk to me about edu
cational ideals. For $2500 a year 1 
will not be sacrificed on the altar 
of educational experiment to the 
god of educational innovation. I 
want a good job, and I want a 
future. If I only wanted an educa
tion I would have got myself a 
library card and read good books..
for free. But Im paying for a 
college degree; get me into a good 
graduate school.
Most graduate schools are quite 
willing to accept credit/ no entry 
grades in non-major courses. But, 
according to the admissions di
rector at Stanford Medical School, 
when a student must or does take a 
majority of his courses on a pass/ 
fail (credit/ no entry) basis, ... it 
is absolutely mandatory that the 
admissions committee receive very 
detailed information regarding his 
instructors perception of his (the 
students) ability to do course 
work in order that he receive a fair 
hearing. This puts the H&SS gra
duates at a disadvantage, since 
many graduate schools dont have 
time to read recommendations, no 
matter how flattering.
A recent study done at the Uni
versity of Minnesota indicated that 
students who took a course pass/ 
fail did poorer than students who 
took the course on a graded basis. 
A study at Dartmouth revealed 
that pass/fail students did much 
less required work, attended class 
less often, and would have received 
a final grade one full letter lower 
than other students. The same was 
found to hold true at Princeton.
Thus, the attitude of a graduate 
admission officer at the University 
of Miami, As far as insuring a firm 
command of a particular disci
plines basic skills is concerned, it 
(pass/fail, credit/no entry, etc. . .) 
is not such a hot idea.
Great.
Fortunately, H&SS does offer 
an honors (H) rating in its courses, 
which may be some aid in graduate 
admission. H represents H&SSs 
acknowledgement of the practical 
necessity of the traditional lettergrading system. But will some Hs 
in a portfolio of passes be enough 
to keep graduate schools from 
passing right over H&SS tran
scripts?
Education is not necessarily inconsistant with traditional gra
ding. Is the credit/no entry system 
worth the problem it presents? 
Dean Steinberg, say something 
reassuring.

Letters
Editor, the TARTAN:
As a freshman, I would like to 
compliment the CMU Administra
tion on one of the things which has 
impressed me about this placethe 
maintenance. A particularly good 
example is Doherty Hall. The first 
time I saw it after arriving here, it 
looked like an ojd gray building 
which for some reason had a first 
floor divided in the middle.
However, the steam-cleaning of 
Doherty Hall has transformed it 
into an attractive building which 
looks much better sitting next to 
(actually, connected to) Stever 
Hall. The first floor still has me 
puzzled, though.
The grounds of this university 
are also in exceptional condition 
for a mid-city campus with the ex
ception of those ugly brown 
patches created by ecologically in
considerate students taking short
The Largest Selection of 
Imported and Domestic 
Tobaccos and Pipes 
in the City
cuts.
The reason I am mentioning 
this is that most university admini
strations which find themselves in 
a financial squeeze instinctively 
postpone their maintenance 
projects. I am glad that CMU has 
been wise enough not to follow 
such a disasterous policy.

Editor, the TARTAN:
We, the bike bitchers, are tired 
of having no place to chain our 
bikes, tired of sap running over the 
handle bars where we have des
perately chained them to trees, 
tired of hanging them on stair 
railings (and people tripping over 
them), tired of locking them to fire 
hazards, tired of the visual pollu
tion of fifteen or twenty bikes all 
clumped together, and also tired of 
having these expensive bikes (as
much as $175) being ripped off!
Weve decided to get together 
and do something about the pro
blem. What we need most of all is 
bike racks, lots of them. We need a 
minimum of 12 large racks distri
buted throughout the campus. 
Eventually we might get shelters 
for protection against rain and 
snow and possibly lights to dis
courage vandalism.
In order to do this we need 
help. For one thing we need more 
participation. So, if you are inter
ested in achieving these goals too, 
contact Holly Foss (Morewood). 
Weve had three meetings already 
as a group and will notify you of 
when and where the next one will 
be.
We all share the problem and 
can solve it if we unite now!

Scobell Hall Incident Prompts 
Presidential Concern
***
In light of the growing number 
of assaults, robberies and burgla
ries in CMU dormitories, President 
Stever last Thursday sent a letter 
to his Security Policy Advisory 
Board requesting they immediate
ly undertake a review of Dormi
tory Security on this campus. His 
letter follows:
During the last four weeks there 
has been an alarming increase in 
the number of incidents of armed 
robbery. Fortunately, because of 
the way in which our students 
comported themselves, only minor 
injuries have been sustained. And, 
although three known suspects 
have been apprehended, there is at 
this time no assurance that we will 
not have similar incidents in the 
future.
Since the most recent incident 
on October 18, 1971 various indi
viduals within the campus com
munity have requested one or 
more types of action, some of 
which are: security personnel sta
tioned in each residence hall, more 
security personnel generally, 
changing locks on residence hall 
doors, arming all of our security 
personnel, special training for our 
security personnel.
I am interested in taking such 
action as will both benefit the cam
pus and be accepted by the cam
pus,- and such afction should be ta
ken as promptly as possible. But
the determination of what would 
benefit the campus and what 
would be accepted by the campus 
is not immediately apparent. I 
should like the Security Policy Ad
visory Board to undertake prompt
ly an analysis of the present situa
tion and make appropriate recom
mendations to Vice President 
Strathmeyer.
Mr. Strathmeyer and his staff 
are at this time attempting to de
fine the role of our security per
sonnel in the performance of the 
security function, and 1 know that 
he has asked you to assist him in 
doing this. It is probably true that 
you cannot avoid some considera
tion of this question in your analy
sis of the present situation affect
ing our residence halls. However,! 
believe the present situation to be 
of sufficient seriousness that I am 
asking you to devote your immedi
ate attention to recommendations 
for coping with our new situation 
I believe that by so doing you can 
make an immediate and significant 
contribution to the safety and 
sense of well-being of individuals 
on our campus.

Thursday, October 28, 1971 - The Tartan - Page 3
Several full-time undergradu
ates receiving remission of tuition 
have also been granted scholar
ships by the Pennsylvania Higher 
Education Assistance Agency 
(PHEAA). The PHEAA indicates 
in its award notice to the Univer
sity that the recipient may retain 
any other scholarships or gift assis
tance he has received, provided the 
total of all awards does not exceed 
the amount he needs to attend the 
University. The "need" of each 
student is also provided by the 
PHEAA. The University is also per
mitted, under PHEAA regulations, 
to reduce its commitment to the 
student and allow him to retain the 
PHEAA award if his need would 
otherwise be exceeded.
It is therefore recommended 
that each student be permitted to 
retain those funds he needs to at
tend the University. Any necessary 
adjustments will be against the
remission grant provided that the 
amount of assistance the student 
finally receives be not less than 
that for which he is eligible under 
the remission regulations.
If no objections to this recom
mendation are received by Octo
ber 25, 1971, notification of ne
cessary adjustments will be mailed 
to the students involved.

Student Editors Priorities

to get things moving. Something 
must be done. Government spend
ing must be more thoroughly con
trolled and more sensibly used. Id 
rather tax dollars go to people who 
need help and are less fortunate 
rather than some space exhibition 
that results in inflation, indirectly.
Also state spending should be 
limited to requirements similar to 
national spending involvements. 
The hell with Sky Bus. People have 
many thousands of hours to live 
and saving 20 minutes of a lifetime 
(spent at bar anyway) is not worth 
the added expense.
Student unrest should result in
good for the community and bet
terment of their education. I think 
we students are yelling about 
wrong things. Vietnam will end 
when Nixon wants it to. No 
sooner!!

Margaret McCarvill, VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY-Do you
On Wednesday, November 3, 
Carnegie-Mellon will participate in 
a nation-wide effort aimed at help
ing the nine million East Pakistani 
refugees now in India. THE NO
VEMBER 3 FAST TO SAVE A 
PEOPLE will involve a massive 
fund-raising campaign, coupled 
with an attempt to return the criti
cal situation in West Bengal and 
the other refugee areas to the awareness of the American public.
The refugees from East Paki
stan were victims of a devastating 
cyclone last November which 
claimed half a million lives and ef
fectively removed the years food 
crop, and then, in March, of an 
eruption of civil strife which re
sulted in the violent deaths of ano
ther quarter million people. These 
events precipitated a massive exo
dus of terrified East Pakistani citi
zens out of their country and into 
neighboring India, where their pre
sent number, nine million, is en
larged by thirty thousand daily. 
They are crowded into makeshift 
camps whose facilities are most 
generously described as extremely 
inadequate; in many cases, the 
camps serve merely as grisly arenas 
in which starvation and disease end 
the long journey arbitrarily for 
thousands of people.

anything? There is in your ques

VANIA STATE UNIVERSITY 
The big topic on the campus this 
fall is the right for 18-year-olds to 
vote. As was expected, the candi
dates are attempting to reach this 
group and pull the support of the 
student.
Robert F. Stein, CLARION 
STATE COLLEGE-Of course, it 
is always difficult to pick a n)ost or 
least important problem from such
Outside aid is desperately 
needed, and unless generous amounts of it are forthcoming, it is 
generally feared that a significant 
fraction of the refugees will starve 
to death, or die of exposure and 
the attendant diseases, during the 
coming winter.
THE NOVEMBER 3 FAST TO 
SAVE A PEOPLE, jointly spon
sored by Oxfam-America and Pro
ject Relief, is designed to focus 
national attention upon these 
facts. On that Wednesday, the stu
dents of the nations high schools 
and colleges are being urged to skip 
one or all of the days meals, and 
donate the money thus saved to 
the relief operation.
All money collected during the 
FAST will go directly to Oxfams 
Field Director in India, where a 
dollar can provide one refugee for 
an entire month with supplement
ary high-nutrient foods, multivita
mins, powdered milk, medicines, 
and sanitation services, basic clo
thing, corrugated plastic shelters, 
and tarpaulins. No administrative 
costs will be deducted from the 
proceeds of THE NOVEMBER 3

in India.

their being on the list, they are all 
important. I must admit the 
choices were difficult, but one area 
stood out as the most pressing to 
me.
Our nation, and the rest of the 
world for that matter, is on the 
road to ecological disaster. It is 
true that people are more con
cerned today with the woes of the 
earth than just a year ago, but our 
government seems unconcerned, 
not willing to make the effort to 
save the land or just unaware of the 
magnitude of the problem. But 
something has to be done soon.
FAST on November 3 will trigger a 
nationwide response, whose form 
might be individual and collective 
efforts to raise money and to 
resurrect the issue as headline 
news: artists, musicians, educa
tors, clergy, all Americans of 
means or talent may take their cue 
from the student action and do
nate whatever services are charact
eristic of their professions.

EPA Discovers Mental Illness In Fish
The Environmental Protection 
Administration (EPA) is evalu
ating a worrisome report from the 
owner of a Florida diagnostic 
laboratory who has discovered a 
number of human mental illnesses 
in fish observed in the waters near 
Miami.
Among the disorders named in 
the report are: well-integrated 
paranoid schizophrenia in starfish, 
and catatonic schizophrenia found 
in halibut.
We know that cats and dogs 
can acquire some of the habits and 
mannerisms of their owners, but 
this is the first time that symptoms 
of pressures from one life form 
have affected in any way, another 
life form. Dr. Gerald Berg, chief 
virologist at EPAs Cinncinnati
laboratory, told reporters.
The discovery was made by Dr. 
Glenn Waddell, a psycholgoist of 
West Palm Beach, who says he de
tected the disorders after observa
tions made from a bathysphere, 
and after several conversations 
with some starfish.
I dont know what the impli
cations of the discovery are, but it 
is a very frightening thing, said 
Dr. Waddell.
Dr. Waddell concluded that the 
halibut were catatonics after ob
serving that every time he would 
approach one in his bathysphere, it 
would try to cover itself with 
sand and thus appear to be a part 
of the ocean floor. Human cata
tonics sometimes imagine them
selves to be trees, or other inani
mate objects, and imitate these 
objects, as faithfully as they can, 
sometimes for days on end. Dr. 
Waddell noted, some of the fish 
would remain covered with sand 
for hours. Ive never seen one stay 
in one place for more than five 
hours ... I guess they dont have 
the patience of humans.
The doctor also claimed to have 
had a number of conversations 
with starfish, who, according to 
tapes made from the conversa
tions, fear that the humans are 
trying to make the starfish into 
humans. This, says Dr. Waddell is 
characteristic of a well-integrated 
paranoid schizophrenic, who has 
an almost air-tight story to explain 
some fantasy in his mind. The doc
tor says that the starfish believe
that the increasing amount of mer
cury found in the water is passing 
human traist on to the starfish. 
They say that they have five arms 
because two are going to be arms, 
two are going to be legs, and the 
other eventually will be a head. 
The doctor reported that one fish, 
when asked why his mouth was in 
his middle, replied that theyre 
going to put another mouth in 
with the rest of the face and this 
mouth will become a navel.
When asked if the tapes of the 
fish conversations were available, 
Dr. Waddell said that they had 
been seized by the Pentagon, 
which is studying them in hopes of 
communicating with the starfish, 
and getting them to report the pre
sence of Russian submarines.
Dr. Waddell warned: The hali
but are harmless; scared but harm
less. Weve got to watch the star
fish though. Theyre smart and 
theyre organized. Some starfish 
have begun to stir up others by 
calling humans racists and saying 
that were trying to make them 
look like us. If they get violent, 
they can make the beaches unus
able, and drive the oyster business 
bankrupt!
At least four south Florida 
citiesMiami, Pompano Beach, 
West Palm Beach, and Lakeworthhave large starfish popula
tions.

In SEE NO EVIL Mia Farrow 
gives an excellent performance as a 
blind girl menaced by a homicidal 
maniacs Her performance is the 
only reason to see the film, how
ever, for she not only carries the 
entire motion picture, but also 
makes the thing seem actually be
lievable at times. Without Miss Far
row this film would have been no
thing at all, for its flaws are all too 
apparent. Yet, she does her best to 
help conceal these weaknesses, and 
to her credit, almost succeeds.
If nothing else, SEE NO EVIL 
clearly shows Mia Farrows ma
turity as an actress. Her blind girl is 
a real person whom the audience 
can sympathize with while feeling 
the utter horror of her situation 
without once feeling sorry for her. 
In a role such as this it is all too 
easy to let the audience pity such a 
character and then capitalize upon 
this emotion with a series of heartrendering expressions. Miss Far
row did not choose to take this 
route, and the film is the better for 
her decision. Her character is ab
solutely normal in every respect 
except that she is blind, and it is 
this fact which makes her predica
ment so horribly shocking.
Director Richard Fleischer is 
definitely fortunate that Miss Far
row is the star of his film. Another 
actress might not have been able to 
give the part such depth and 
Fleischers inadequacies might 
have been all the more apparent. 
The gimmick of just showing the 
bad guys boots and nothing more 
until his identity is revealed at the 
end of the film is one that may
have been used just a little too 
much over the years. Perhaps 
Fleischers biggest mistake how
ever, is his decision to keep in the 
film those parts of Brian Clemens 
screenply which thoroughly tax 
the credulity of the viewing audi
ence.
Clemens and Fleischer would 
have the audience believe that a 
man will go bananas and kill four 
people just because they were in a 
car which happened to splash mud 
on his boots. This may be hard to 
swallow, but it is the only incident 
that the audience gets to see of the 
killer being given any reason for his 
actions, so they must assume thats 
why he did it.
The audience also has a little 
trouble swallowing the scene 
where Miss Farrow is found in a 
God forsaken muddy pit by a pair 
of searchers who just happen to 
hear her banging on an old car 
hood with the remnants of a 
muffler. These men have just 
discovered that she is missing, and 
happen by where she is while 
randomly searching an extensive 
section of countryside in a 
Land-Rover. It would have been 
far more dramatic to have her 
hysterically wandering around the 
countryside blindly groping for 
something or someone to aid her, 
but Clemens and Fleischer have to 
bring her back so that she can face 
her tormentor once again and have 
the whole thing wrapped up 
neatly. It is unfortunate that the 
director and screenwriter chose to 
go in this direction, for they ap
pear to have missed a golden op
portunity to intensify their drama 
as well as enable Miss Farrow to 
make the most of her acting abili
ty. What these gentlemen did not 
capitalize on was the fact that to a 
blind person the outdoors, no mat
ter how beautiful it may be to one 
blessed with vision, can be a horri
fying experience frought with all 
sorts of terrifying danger 
infinitely more so than can a house 
or a room which the person can 
find his way around in because he 
is familiar with the placement of 
the various objects.
Where Fleischer does succeed 
however, is in keeping the entire 
film moving at such a fast pace that 
the audience has little time to con
centrate on its flaws. Whenever a 
flaw does glaringly reveal itself, 
Fleischer manages to minimize the 
damage by seeing to it that the 
events which follow it move along 
quickly enough so that the viewer 
has little time to dwell on what he 
has just seen. It is this sense of 
timing as well as Miss Farrows 
acting which couple to save SEE 
NO EVIL from being the bomb 
that it really deserves to be. In
stead of being a far worse picture, 
the film comes off as being rather 
mediocre showcase for Miss Far
rows considerable talents. Hope
fully, in the future Miss Farrows 
efforts will be exhibited in a much 
more carefully constructed frame.

Hello, art lovers.
Occasionally during ones life
time, one finds himself discovering 
fundamental laws of nature to 
which he will steadfastly adhere 
and promote for a period of time, 
until they wear out. Everyone has 
pet theories. The purpose of this 
article is to share with you some of 
the relationships I have discovered
between man and himself. So 
much high school influence. The 
ambitious reader should recognize 
the satirical intent presented. On 
with the show.
FIRST THEOREM: This idea is 
the earliest profound thought clus
ter I now recall. It states: For 
every comfort or pleasure, there is 
an accompanying unpleasant
physical or mental reaction. When 
the pleasure exceeds the pain, the 
experience is positive. When the 
pain is equal to or greater than the 
pleasure derived, the experience is 
negative. I must add that positive 
experiences are not exclusively 
beneficial, and that negative exper
iences do not necessarily exclude 
beauty. Only a logical conclusion,
09

able fo be deduced from your own 
experiences.
I derived this first theorem as a 
Cub Scout several years ago. I had 
been attending a baseball game 
with my troop (Pack No. 3) at 
Oaklands own Forbes Field. It 
was^a, night game, Pittsburgh op
posing the San Francisco Giants. 
In the seventh inning, my body 
informed me that I had eaten too 
many hot dogs. I realized at that 
time that, although I was enjoying 
myself (and had relished the hot 
dogs), that I was feeling discom
fort. The theorem struck me in its 
crude form: you pay for all your 
pleasure. As I held onto the 
theory, I made refinements in it 
until it became the idea presented 
above.
I no longer push this ideathe 
object is to derive pleasure without 
sacrifice, mental or physical. I thus 
leave the theorem unproven, for I 
believe there should be a way to 
experience the former without the 
latter. As of yet, however, I have 
met no man who can shape his own 
conditions.
SECOND THEOREM: Con
cerns religion, and has been greatly 
chopped down since it first ap
peared to me in order to accomo
date my widely varying attitudes. 
The only section of this idea I still 
retain is: Early man created gods 
to explain phenomena man him
self could not explain. As science 
explained these events (e.g., wind, 
motion of planets, etc.), man 
found he needed less and less gods, 
until. The idea stops there.
These thoughts were produced 
under pressure in my high school 
English class, and the more pres
sure applied to me, the more I ad
hered5 to my ideas. At that time, 
the theorem had a conclusion,
.. Until there was one god, 
which is todays God. This God is 
needed by man to explain first, the 
origin of the matter in the uni
verse, and second, innate good. In 
its most radical form, it concluded 
that when science found answers 
to both of these, God would be 
dead to man, and vice versa.
. I had to abandon the remainder 
as I realized how little I really 
knew of religion. Having been 
familiar with only the Christian 
and Hebrew faiths, I actually had 
no real basis for the follow-up of 
my idea. Also, complications arose 
when objectiveness departed in the 
midst of wanting to believe in a 
higher being.
Does God exist? Look around, 
at anything. Nature? A perfect 
system, though defiled by imper
fect man. Look at anything manmade and think of its existence. 
Look at anything. Is man so crea
tive, so intelligent to have fostered 
all these things alone? I do not 
think so. Look at life. An endless 
cycle, self-preserving, yet it cannot 
be explained in terms of science, 
mathematics or by any form of 
mans intelligence. We cannot even 
prove that we are alive. Maybe 
were the product of an imagina
tion or possibly we are dream char
acters. Who can truly explain the 
birth, life and death of life? That 
answers my question.
The preceeding passage, not my 
own, doesnt complete the 
theorem, though.
THE FRIENDSHIP THEORY: 
That of the decay of friendships. 
A barometer of friendship is the 
amount each party learns from the 
other. A fresh and thriving alliance 
is one whose members are continu
ously developing with each other. 
A friendship which relies upon the 
remembrance of past experiences 
and discoveries to push it ahead 
has a stagnating future. This idea 
is about five years oldI still give it 
credibility. At least it still applies 
to my environment. By now, those 
of you reading probably think this 
entire article to be satiric. The odd 
part is that it is not. I do not hold 
these suggestions as profound, or 
even generally true, and I am sure 
most people have experienced 
them themselves. So, my purpose 
is to document them, in an article 
you still might believe to be a jag.

THIRD THEOREM: I was pre
sented once with the problem of 
deciding what to do with a parti
cular mixed-media thing I was 
working on in art. In high school. 
Looking at the object carefully, I 
decided that the piece had limits 
if I tried to exceed these limits, the 
nature of the work itself would 
detract from any extra effort and 
make it look strange. Thus the 
third theorem: It is better to do 
a good mediocre job than a medi
ocre good job. The latter case 
shows your objective to be a good 
job. In order to be acceptable, the 
objective should be reached. Medi
ocrity, however, makes a good job 
incomplete. On the other hand, a 
good mediocre job both meets the 
objective (the mediocre job) and is 
also good. I hope you realize that a 
good good job is better than either 
of these, and a mediocre mediocre 
job worse than both. If you per
ceive the limits of any task, then 
try to fulfill the task within the 
limits, not straying beyond the 
limits without completing it, you 
will have performed well. .
Another way of looking at it is 
this. You hear two songs on the 
radio. One is generally unimpres
sive, but it has a certain section
where the drum, tambourine, lead, 
rhythm and bass guitars go toge
ther fantastically. You listen to the 
song repeatedly to hear that one 
part. The other song is very com
petently produced and performed, 
but the lead guitarist poops up in 
the middle (probably from Creedence Clearwater) and ruins the 
song with a few muted notes. Of 
course, you listen to the song re
peatedly to hear that one part.
BEHAVIOR OF MAN: Men 
hurt and kill from fear, not from 
hate. This may seem simple to 
everyone, anyone who has read a 
psychology book skimpily or lis
tened to Walter Cronkite. Its dif
ferent when you discover it your
self though. I did just a few weeks 
ago when I was having invasions of 
spiders in my room. You may say, 
I kill spiders because I hate them 
and theyre ugly. What you mean 
is, I kill spiders because I fear 
them (ugliness being a fear stimuli) 
and I hate spiders because my fear 
causes me to want to kill them.
The next issue of Psychology 
Today contains such articles as . . .
So I see a large ciliated spider 
walking along the hall today so I 
grab a handy piece of wood and
squish. I do not display the same 
behavior with small spiders or 
beetles . (or praying mantises) 
which I have no fear of. I even like 
praying mantises. My theory still 
holds.
DISHHEADS STICK TO
GETHER: This theory states: 
Dishheads Stick Together. They 
do, too. All your favorite dish
heads seem to know one another, 
sit together in class, eat together, 
etc. You always see them in groups 
of two or more. Sometimes they 
will surprise you. You might see 
one of your least liked dishheads 
walking somewhere, only to ob
serve he was going up to meet 
another of your favorite menaces 
you never saw him with. And then 
theres YOU. Who do you hang 
around with, Joe Cool? Or are you 
a loner? Be comforted. Someone 
somewhere considers you a dishhead and will begin to watch your 
companions for the same traits.
I just came up with that one

burst through the door, followed 
by the rest of the crowd plus all the 
curious people picked up on the 
way.
The girls of 6B were more hos
pitable. Having shown the least 
positive reaction to 5Es appear
ance on the floor, they were drawn 
in with unconscious enthusiasm, 
and before realizing it, a girl was 
walking down the aisle. The wed
ding was over as quickly as it be
gan, whereupon 5E said their 
goodbyes, thank yous and their 
congratulations and withdrew 
down the stairs in the same manner 
in which they came. The only 
thing that remained was the echo
In looking over the mail which 
comes into the TARTAN office 
each week I found the following 
letter. In my opinion it did not 
belong in the letters column. Not 
only was there a letter but pictures 
were enclosed. I did not believe the 
letter at first. But the pictures con
vinced me. The copy is as follows-.
Dear Editor:
I wish to complain about the 
strange goings on at Morewood 
Gardens. Specifically coming from 
the fifth floor of E Tower. The 
gentlemen, and I use the term 
loosely, that occupy that floor call 
themselves the Magnificent Bas
tards, a name which hardly des
cribes them. As a matter of fact, I
dont believe that there is a word in 
the English language which could 
be used to describe them.
In the past couple of weeks, 
there has been a number of un
usual activities emanating from 
5E. This letter was written mainly 
to inform the rest of the campus 
about these boys. At first these 
events appeared to be just harmless 
little pranks which usually happen 
at the beginning of the year. Now, 
Im beginning to wonder what to 
expect next. I must warn though 
that these are only the events that I 
have seen, but rumor has it that 
there are countless numbers.
The first one, which I had the 
unpleasantness to observe, started
at 11:30 PM on Monday, October 
4. It all began with the phone ring
ing on 5B. The girl who answered 
the phone, after having put the
of the floor counselors repeated 
words Parietals are over. So 
much for wedding number one.
The second wedding was fo
cused on 6A. It was like the first 
except that this wedding was an
nounced, and preplanned even to 
the flowers. Only half the wedding 
party is in the picture I have en
closed. Following the various pic
tures, the groom was escorted to 
the front of Morewood Gardens 
where he promptly had his bridal 
shower courtesy of the Morewood 
Gardens fountain. End of wedding 
two.
The next unusual event that 
took place was a meeting of the 
Board of Directors of 5E. As I was 
waiting in line for dinner, I recog
nized the various gentlemen who 
entered wearing jackets and ties as 
being members of 5E. I even was 
more shocked when these gentle
men set up four round tables at the 
vertices of a square in the back of 
the Morewood cafeteria and held 
their board meeting.
These are all the occurences 
that have come through my per
sonal observations. I am sorry that 
I cannot tell you more, but until I 
find out the rest of their shenani
gans (which are estimated already 
to be approaching triple figures) I 
will make them available to you as 
soon as I learn of them. This floor 
should be watched closely in the 
near future, for I dare not think of
receiver to her ear, heard instead of
the usual Hello, is ------there,
was asked Hello, would anyone 
on your floor like to get mar
ried???? Thinking that this was 
the usual prank, she said Yes 
and after a few choice words, she 
hung up. Ten minutes later, all hell 
broke loose. 5B had been invaded 
by 5E, including a preacher, a vio
linist, a photographer, a cast of 
thousands and even a groom. 5B 
promptly retreated to their rooms 
and locked themselves in. But this 
did not stop the bastards. They 
immediately proceeded to pick up 
the phone and call 6B. The girl had 
barely said Yes (falling to the 
same fault as before) and was still

of all our military forces from Indo-China. I believe that if the billions of dollars 
the war is costing, us would be applied to the problems of our cities it would help 
end racism and violence
Newsweek Magazine featured youth on its cover last week. Everyone is interested In how 
the newly enfranchised young voters will turn out at the polls. It isnt so much how 
you will vote as it is whether you will vote. For the first time here in Allegheny County 
young voters can take part in a Congressional election. It's the only Congressional elec
tion in the nation this year. It is no overstatement to say that the eyes of the nation 
are upon you. The rest is up to you.
Here is what JOHN CONNELLY stands for:
DRAFT: "I 'm fed up with the military-industrial complex 
planning wars for young men to die instop this stupid war 
and end the draft/'
NEW PRIORITIES: "I believe if we cut the defense budget by 
at least $20 billion, we could move forward to an end to 
poverty, pollution, rot and decay of our cities and an end to 
racism."
PRISON REFORM: "The conditions of our prisons are appaling ... I will give my full support for prison reform. There 
must be no more Atticas!"
EDUCATION: "I will fight for higher state and federal appro
priations for universities and students/7
WOMEN: "I support the equal rights amendment guaran
teeing an end to discrimination against women/7
JOBS: "I would give top priority to Federal action to insure 
a job for every American/'

Sports
Varsity Football Triumphs, Big!
Apparently, CMU has been sit
ting on a powder keg for six weeks, 
but it wasnt until last Saturday 
that it finally blew sky high. The 
Tartans explosive offense was fi
nally ignited at the expense of 
Franklin and Marshall College, and 
the result was a five touchdown 
second half barrage that gave the 
Plaid their third victory in six 
games, by a score of 40-7.
Throughout the first half it ap
peared to be all F&M, as their 
highly touted, 8th ranked defense 
in the nation continually forced 
the Tartans to punt away the ball, 
keeping their backs pinned to the 
goal. The Tartans only formidable 
offensive feat of the half was an 
early Rich Squires bomb to Brian 
Carlock. However, the Diplomat 
defense forced Tech to punt from 
its own goal line, resulting in F&M 
possession at our 25. Five plays 
later it was a tie ball game, and so it 
was at halftime, 7-7.
But then Tom Lombardo began 
to run. And run. The Dips couldnt 
tackle him. The first time Tech got 
the ball, Lumpy accounted for 50 
of the 60 yards it took to score. 
The last 11 he picked up as he 
broke 5 tackles and dragged 3 
players into the endzone with him.
But Lumpy didnt stop there. 
The next time the Plaid got the 
ball, Lumpy chewed up some more 
turf (and a few more Diplomats) as 
CMU marched 75 yards for a score. 
This time it was Rich Squires, 
pitching his best game of the sea
son, who sparked the drive, along 
with an F&M pass interference 
penalty called in the endzone. And 
Lumpy got the TD. Squires then 
hit Carlock in the corner for two 
more points and at the end of the
Cross Country Victory
Meets that are close are sweet, 
but only when theyre over and 
youre on top. Thats how Coach 
Meckleys harriers defeated 
Waynesburg 27 to 28. Injuries con
tinued to hamper the small squad 
as Dennis Sullivan reinjured his 
pulled muscle to finish his season 
and Dave Byers literally ran the 
callous off his left heel (yet still ran 
his fastest time to date on the 
Schenley course). But after Ken
third quarter it was 21 -7.
Once again the Big Red D 
came, saw, and conquered and the 
offense was back. Well, it would 
have been ridiculous for the Plaid 
to score again, so the referees 
called Brian Carlock for offensive 
pass interference after he caught 
another pass in the endzone. Had 
the game been close, the call would 
have been questionable, but at 
that point, who really wanted to 
bicker over 6 more?
Nevertheless, the offense 
wasnt finished. Tom Lombardo, 
of all people, pitched a 40 yard 
fullback pass to Charlie Price, who 
had his defender beat. Would you 
believe 33-7?
And for the finale, with 30 se
conds left, reserve linebacker Bob 
Pyzdrowski picked off an F&M 
pass and returned it 20 yards to the 
Dip 40. On the next play, Jim Allera hit Charlie Price at the one and 
two plays later, Allera scored with 
one second left! Mike Stevens 
added the point and the final was 
40-7.
So. . . when youre hot youre 
hot! This week Tech faces its big
gest challenge of the season against 
a big, strong Washington U. of St. 
Louis. If the Tartans can boost 
their record to 4-3, you can count 
em as one of the strongest small 
college teams in the East, despite 
their slow start. Its your last 
chance to see the Tartans at home 
and the last home game for 8 
seniors, who have over 25 years of 
starting experience between them. 
Come out, support your team, and 
thank your Seniors. Big Red is for 
real!.
Scotch Guard
Kloes and Tony McKay took the 
easy 1-2. Tom Silvis, Greg Hyatt 
and Wayne Bingham came through 
beautifully spaced, as in a coachs 
dream, only seconds apart with 
7th, 8th, and 9th to achieve the 
narrow victory.
October 23 took the harriers to 
Westminster where they faced 
Westminster and St. Vincent. CMU 
fell 23 to 35 to Westminster while 
romping over St. Vincent 21 to 34.

Future Varsity Football
Eight CMU seniors will be 
playing their final home game this 
Saturday, Oct. 30, when the Tar
tans take on Washington Uni
versity of St. Louis at Tech Field. 
Game time is 1:30 PM.
The eight seniors are all starters, 
six offensively and two on defense. 
On the offensive line are tackles 
Denny Weakland, Scott Calvert 
and Guard Denny Doran. In the 
backfield are quarterback Rich 
Squires and running backs Tom 
Lombardo and Terry Bell. Defen
sive end Gary Meilahn and safety 
Tom Sumpter will also be playing 
their last home game for the Tarof Westminsters squad, CMU run
ners turned in exceptional perfor
mances. Most notable was Ken 
Kloes blistering under five minute 
a mile pace over 4.9 miles which 
force the Westminster home
coming crowd to watch the red 
and white of CMU set a 24:10 
course record. McKays 25:16 
fourth place (pretty good for a 
sprinter, huh?) was followed by 
Bingham, Silvis and Hyatt with 
times of 27:20, 27:28, and 28:34
tans Saturday.
Last week at Tech Field, the 
Tartans rolled over previously un
defeated Franklin & Marshall by 
the score of 40-7. It was only 7-7 at 
half-time but the Diplomats never 
had a chance in the second half. 
Terry Bell and Lumpy Lombardo 
combined once again for over 200 
yards on the ground and two 
touchdowns. Rich Squires com
pleted 14 of 24 passes for 190 
yards and two touchdowns. The 
Tartan defense held F&M to 83 
yards on the ground and picked off 
four Diplomat passes. Everything 
seemed to click for the Tartans, as 
evidenced by fullbadc Lumpy 
Lombardos 35-yard touchdown 
pass to flanker Charlie Price. The 
Diplomats began to pass heavily 
late in the game but they could 
never break the Tartans grip and 
the final score is indicative of the 
fine all-around game CMU has put 
together in its last two outings, 
both of which theyve won by 
large margins.
Senior Quarterback Rich 
Squires has provided CMU fans 
with many exciting pass plays over 
the past four years and holds alrespectively.
And so for MVP Ken Kloes, co
captains elect Dennis Sullivan and 
Wayne Bingham,for Tony McKay, 
Tom Silvis, Greg Hyatt and Dave 
Byers, another cross country 
season comes to a close. Predic
tions for next year? Well, one 
would have to be more than cau
tious to make predictions about 
cross countrys future at CMU, it is 
always unexpected.
Cross country is consistent in a 
few things. One of the most impor
tant is the extra effort of the indiv
iduals; Kloes did not have to run 
over 1000 miles this summer. . . 
but he did. And coach Meckley 
doesnt have to be dedicated to the 
teams success.. .but he is.
This effort and this dedication 
make cross country what it is, and 
it is within these that its true vic
tories lie.
Dennis Sullivan
most every Tartan passing record, 
including most career yardage, a 
record he broke in last weeks game 
with F&M. Backing him up as run
ning backs is a pair of seniors who 
have been outstanding the past 
three years, each gaining over 500 
yards per season. Terry Bell and 
Tommy Lombardo have provided 
the explosive power necessary to 
sustain the CMU ground attack, 
with Bell rushing for over 6.5 yards 
per carry and Lombardo averaging 
just under 5 yards per carry. Terry 
is only two points away from his 
brother Dicks career scoring mark 
of 138 points and should easily 
break it before the season is over. 
Without blockers a running game 
does not function, but the Tartans 
have three four-year starting 
linemen that have provided Bell 
and Lombardo with many holes in 
their careers. Seniors Denny Weak
land, Scott Calvert, and Denny Do
ran have been important factors in 
the success of the Tartan offense 
and their loss at graduation will 
hurt the offensive line consider
ably next year.

I.M. Football
Last week saw three big games 
in IM action. And in a new surprise 
this Tuesdays big game is included 
here.
ATO and Pika met last Thurs
day, and the Pikas ended up on 
top 36-22. The first quarter ended 
in a 7-7 tie, with an opportunistic 
ATO defense being very stingy 
with long passes. Pika scored again 
in the second quarter to move to a
14-7 halftime advantage. ATO 
fought back, and their second 
touchdown knotted the score at
15-15. In the fourth quarter 
though, Pika scored first and most 
as their three touchdowns, the last 
on an impressive catch, were 
enough to offset some excellent 
late game running plays by the 
ATOs. Final again 36-22.
SAE and Beta clashed for the 
first time last Tuesday and the Sig 
Alphs were victorious 15-14. 
Tough defensive exchanges led to a 
scoreless first quarter, but some 
good catches gave SAE an 11-0 
halftime lead. They built it to 13-0 
before Beta came back with 7 third 
quarter points. An SAE first down 
and another Beta TD tied the game 
at 14-14. A scramble for the final 
point of the game gave SAE the
15-14win.
Beta rebounded to slaughter SN 
58-5, and set up a rematch with 
SAE.
The rematch was far different 
from the first meeting, as it was 
Beta taking the quick lead and the 
Sig Alphs trying to play catch up. 
Beta put together a 22-10 win to 
nail second place in the American 
League. Beta scored first on a short 
pass to Crapster. Sae came back to 
score a safety, and the first quarter 
ended 6-2. Mike Niles ran in from 
the 2 and Beta added a safety to 
move out to 13-2 at the half. SAE 
came back with an 8-yard pass to 
Sacco, and closed the gap to 14-9 
after three. A good catch between 
defenders by Dexter Murphy 
ended the TD scoring and Beta 
took it 22-10. ,
Come out and see the playoffs. 
IM volleyball playoffs start this 
week, with Beta A, SAE Derelicks, 
Sigma Nu A, and ATO B winning 
their leagues. The Second place 
finishes entering the playoffs are 
DTD A, Old Folks, Black Majics, 
and Feva. -

Soccer
While most Pittsburgh residents 
were busy proclaiming how sweet 
it was after the Pirates victory 
over the Orioles, the members of 
CMUs tenacious soccer team had 
even more reason to celebrate. For 
the second consecutive game they 
had outclassed what Jimmy the 
Greeks amateur athletic-oriented 
friends would have labeled a fa
vored opponent.
Last Tuesday when Slippery 
Rock came to the Skibo Bowl, the 
booters faced a potentially disap
pointing season, but, with the re
cent addition of Juan Neffa (Need
less to say, a prodigal son) they 
were able to stymie the opponents,
1-0. Peter Moses scored for CMU 
with but 20 seconds gone in the 
game with Napoleonic authority. 
There is no doubt that CMU will 
start to enjoy some of the success 
which had previously eluded them.
As the team rolled into Indiana, 
they again faced the formidable 
opponent, and by the half time 
intermission they were down 2-0. 
However, Dan Streyley, the poten
tial all WPSIA freshman carried the 
momentum of the game to CMUs 
favor, and ultimately they won,

4-3, on an overtime goal by A1 
Koblan. Peter Moses was unable to 
play on his sore right knee, but 
Neffa moved up to the offensive 
line in the second half and pro
vided two important scores. Joel 
Kneisley, Ken Kern, Peter Schul
ler, and Mike Smith also per
formed well for the winners.
Then the soccer team traveled 
to Cambridge Springs, Pa., to take 
on Alliance. They were accom
panied by a wildly attired con
glomerate India. Nazir Sunderji 
(whose other seven names I will 
disclose at some later date) was in 
full dress uniform, complete with 
wiesel tails and back rattle, to 
honor CMUs surging team, which 
has not lost in its last five games.
The booters made Alliance 
their most recent victims, 1-0, and 
in doing so netted the first goal by 
an Alliance opponent this year in 
beautiful downtown Cambridge 
Springs. In the game, the 
ubiquitous CMU defense, sup
ported by goalie John Lape, was 
the obvious standout. As usual, 
Bad Dan Streyle played very 
well; meanwhile, Goran Bencic 
provided the margin of victory 
with his first goal of the year, un
assisted. Kenny Kern, who had the
toughest job of anyone, won his 
private battle, whil Nazir, per
forming the Clark Kent tricks in 
reverse, nevertheless took care of 
his position. Mike Smith, who (be
lieve it or not) found his Skibo 
breakfast slightly upsetting before 
the game, ate a victory meal after 
it. Peter Moses, whose sore knee 
seems to have only cut down the 
time of his one man act, provided 
the finess and Alan Koblan, the 
punch. Juan Neffa, heading the in
ternational group of booters, 
which makes the UN look like a 
playgroup gathering in New Yorks 
West Side, was his old self, the 
veritable Mountain Man.
There are some who are 
skeptical about the soccer team 
and its international merits, afraid 
of possible internal problems. 
There is, however, nothing but 
respect throughout the whole 
club, which now has a winning at
titude that will be hard tosubdue. 
CMU will not lose any more games 
this year, and since they are all at 
home, you had better get your 
tickets now. They are free,

Will CMU Join An Athletic Conference?
A letter from President Stever 
released to the Tartan last week 
makes known that before Dr. Kibbee left, he sent President Stever 
notice of the recommendation 
made by the CMU Athletic Board 
that this University seek member
ship in the Presidents Athletic 
Conference. The letter stresses 
the importance both to the confer
ence and to CMUs varsity sports 
teams that a decision be forthcom
ing before the conference meets in 
early December. Membership in an 
inter-collegiate conference was 
proposed by the Athletic Board 
last year and was the result of a 
decades attempt to interest the 
Administration in the idea of en
tering an athletic conference. Ap
parently not wanting to make a 
hasty decision President Stever has 
agreed that Dean Swank, &ho now 
serves as Chairman of the Athletic 
Board, will request the prepara
tion of a series of position papers 
from various campus groups fami
liar with CMUs varsity athletic 
program.
The groups asked to prepare
position papers were the Athletic 
Board, the Athletic Department, 
and the Student Affairs Council of 
the Faculty Senate. These position 
papers are to be an attempt at - 
assessing the future place of varsity 
athletics in the range of opportuni
ties afforded by this University to 
its students.
It was not expected that the 
Student Seante would prepare a 
position paper since there is stu
dent representation of both the 
Athletic Board and the Student 
Affairs Council of Faculty Senate. 
However, should the Student Sen
ate wish to prepare a position pa
per it would be welcomed by Presi
dent Stever.
The position papers are to be in 
President Stevers hands no later 
than the 29th of October. At that 
time President Stever will appoint 
a special University committee to 
assist him in evaluating the reports. 
A final decision on entering the 
PAC is expected by mid-Novem
ber.
