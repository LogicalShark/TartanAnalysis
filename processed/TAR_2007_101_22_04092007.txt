Transit 
update: 
28X to stay
by Claire Morgenstern
News Editor
Attention, travelers: The 28X, 
the Port Authoritys Airport 
Flyer, initially slated for elimi
nation by PATs proposed budget 
cuts, isnt going anywhere. On 
March 30, the Port Authority 
board of directors approved a 
15 percent service cut. While 
this does mean that 29 other 
routes will be eliminated come 
June 17, some 95 originally fac
ing elimination will remain in 
service, including the 28X.
The cut is the largest in the 
Port Authoritys 43-year history, 
according to an April 3 article 
in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
The change will save $35 mil
lion of the companys projected 
$80 million deficit in fiscal year 
2008. Though drastic, the cuts 
are less severe than the origi
nal plan, a one-time cut of 25 
percent. The plan passed by the 
board of directors involves the 
initial cut as well as a potential 
second cut of 10 percent, which, 
if passed, will go into effect Sep
tember 2. The second cut would 
address the remaining $45 mil
lion deficit.
Under the new plan, the 28X 
would come less frequently, but 
the routes customary minibuses 
would be replaced by regular 
40-foot buses. In addition, four

The truth about summer internships
Searching for Senators: CMU elections delayedStudents recall genocide
of both past and present
importance of networking and landing that 
highly regarded internship position. Through
out the year, the university Career Center 
holds numerous workshops to assist students 
with interview skills, rsum writing, and the 
entire internship search process. The campus 
hosts several career fairs, including the TOC 
and BOC, which are both student-organized 
job fairs that bring hundreds of recruiters 
to campus each fall. Even this past summer 
alone, over 300 students in the College of 
Engineering received internship positions, 
according to the Career Center.
While building skills and making connec
tions with companies are beneficial, students 
should not feel required to land an intense 
internship that mirrors a full-time job every 
year to keep up with other students, said Su
san Timko, career consultant for the Career 
Center.
One substantive internship is fabulous, 
Timko said. While there are some students 
that [complete internships] all three sum
mers, its kind of that last summer which is 
critical. There are a lot of different permu
tations, but gaining some type of real-world 
experience is vital.
Students seek out these experiences, many 
of which are unpaid, require temporary resi
dential relocation, or involve monotonous 
office tasks, in order to build their re
sumes.
Students that do internships have a 
strong competitive advantage against 
those that do not, stated Erin Baker, the 
recruitment manager for the Regional Intern
ship Center of Southwestern Pennsylvania, 
which provides a website database connect
ing students with local organizations as well 
as additional internship search advice. The 
National Association of Colleges and Em
ployers reported that of the graduating class 
of 2006, about 62 percent had completed internships. Employers are expecting to see that 
experience on a resume, and internship expe
rience will lead to more advanced internships 
and job offers.
The opportunity to beat the competition is 
a major incentive for students. The internship 
experience is not only beneficial to students 
future careers after graduation, but is also 
viewed by Carnegie Mellon career advisers as 
an important exercise in leadership.
Internships are part of a larger ex
perimental education component that all 
undergraduates should participate in some 
way in their careers, said Stephanie Wallach, 
director of the Undergraduate Research Of
fice. It gives students the opportunity to test 
a career direction. Also its a great way to see 
the application of things that are learned in 
the classroom and how they play out in a real 
work situation.
Baker added that students across all majors 
should think outside the box when search
ing for work experience that will help them 
in the future.
Even if your field is not traditional in 
the realm of internships, there are things 
that you can do to get real-world experience 
 whether it is volunteering, job shadow
ing, or writing a letter to a company that may 
not have an internship program in place and 
expressing interest in getting involved some
how, Baker said.
Carnegie Mellon students have the op
portunity to participate in a wide range of 
on-campus organizations to develop skills 
that can be used in the workplace. Timko sug
gests that campus involvement and commu
nity service can be as impressive on a resume 
as a traditional internship.
She also emphasized that students dont 
necessarily need to follow the traditional

Last Friday, the student 
government Elections Board 
postponed elections from today 
until Tuesday, April 24. By the 
original deadline, the Elections 
Board, a committee of represen
tatives from the Student Senate 
and the Graduate Student As
sembly, had received only 10 
petitions for the 30 vacant spots 
in the Student Senate.
The deadline for petitions has 
been extended to Wednesday, 
April 11, at 5 p.m. Platforms are 
due Tuesday, April 17, by 11:59 
p.m.
According to the Senate by
laws, each college is required 
to have a certain number of stu
dent representatives. Many of 
the empty seats this year belong 
to historically underrepresented 
colleges, such as CFA.
With the approaching dead
lines, however, the forerunners 
in the presidential and vice presi
dential race have already made 
themselves known.
We hope this year left the stu
dent body with the impression 
that student government can 
and should be a positive agent 
of change on behalf of students, 
said Karl Sjogren, a public policy 
senior and the current student 
body president. Andrea Hamil
ton, a senior public policy and 
art major, is currently vice presi
dent.
Three pairs of students have 
come to the forefront in hopes of 
winning the title of president and 
vice president for the 2007-2008 
academic year.
Colin Sternhell, a junior eco
nomics major, is running for 
president. His running mate, 
Lauren Hudock, is a junior public 
policy and philosophy major.
Alan Eaton, a junior public 
policy major, is running for presi
dent. His running mate, Abiola 
Fasehun, is a fourth-year in the 
five-year scholar program as an 
ethics, history, and public policy 
major.

For those walking along the 
Cut last week, the three series of 
signs detailing the experiences 
of Holocaust victims were hard 
to miss. The signs were intended 
to bring people on campus to
gether in remembering their 
collective past. The organization 
of the event itself was collective 
 the signs and all the mem
oirs and facts that were on them 
were a result of the first year of 
collaboration between the Hillel 
Jewish University Center (JUC) 
of Pittsburgh, Amnesty Inter
national, and Allies, Carnegie 
Mellons Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, 
and Transgender (GLBT) student 
organization.
Every year, the JUC organizes 
events on campus to commemo
rate the tragic events of the 
Holocaust, which took the lives 
of approximately nine to 11 mil
lion Jews and non-Jews under 
Adolf Hitlers regime. This years 
events included screenings of 
the films Au Revoir and Paper 
Clips. Au Revoir depicts the Jews 
defiance of German anti-Semitic 
policies by enrolling Jewish chil
dren in schools in France. Paper 
Clips documents the efforts of a
middle-school class in Whitwell, 
Tenn., to collect one paper clip 
for each life lost as a result of the 
Holocaust.
The JUC decided to imitate the 
project by asking students to do
nate bottle caps to several boxes 
in the University Center. The 
project was an effort to help the 
campus community understand 
how the Holocaust impacted the 
lives of millions of Jews as well 
as those of other groups, such as 
Communists and the disabled.
Last Thursday, members of 
the JUC volunteered to read the 
names of children who died in the 
Holocaust. Although the reading 
was from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the 
group could not get through all 
the names. Members of Amnesty 
International and other groups 
also participated in the reading.
Jewish culture is really 
about remembering the past, 
and thats why its important to 
remember all the people that 
lost their lives because of the 
Holocaust, said David Rush, 
a senior in psychology and 
human-computer interaction and 
former co-president of the JUC. 
I definitely feel that people that 
people are impacted by such ef
forts. For example, some students

Internships have become an 
essential component to under
graduate, education. In many 
fields, applying for internships 
has become as stressful for 
students as applying to col
lege itself was. In order to be 
considered for competitive 
jobs, students at colleges and 
universities across the coun
try feel that they must grapple 
for an internship to gain skills, 
improve their resumes, and 
get work experience before 
graduation. Carnegie Mellon 
students, in particular, are no 
exception.
Between the Career 
Center, Technical Op
portunities Conference 
(TOC), and Business 
Opportunities Confer
ence (BOC), students 
are constantly re
minded of the
Sean Weinstock, a junior busi
ness major and political science 
minor, is running for president. 
His running mate, Adi Jain, is a 
junior electrical and computer 
engineering major and econom
ics minor.
Sternhell serves on the 
Student Senate Finance Com
mittee. A brother of Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, he has been on the 
chapters Standards Board and 
served as member development 
coordinator. Within the Greek 
community, he was appointed 
IFC recruitment chair and Greek 
Sing cochair. He received the 
award for Outstanding Young 
Greek by Greek Council.
Hudock is the Student Sen
ate Communications Committee 
Chair. In addition, she is a 
member of the Social and Deci
sion Sciences Student Advisory 
Council, musical director for 
Soundbytes, a choreographer for 
Dancers Symposium, and Carn
egie Mellons ACLU coordinator.
Sternhell and Hudock stated 
that, if elected, they aim to 
improve student life and that 
they have have several starting 
ideas with which to do so. How
ever, they stated that they do 
not want to place a number on 
the possibilities for campus, and 
instead plan on developing and 
modifying their platform as each 
challenge comes along.
Last year, Weinstock served 
as communications chair for 
Student Senate. A brother of Pi 
Kappa Alpha, he has served as the 
chapters treasurer and a member 
of the executive board of Greek 
Council. Jain is the president of 
Mayur, the largest South Asian 
organization on campus. Mayur 
sponsors cultural and social ac
tivities reflecting its heritage and 
ethos.
I knew that as student body 
vice president, I could act as a 
voice to encourage collabora
tion between cultural groups, 
Jain said, and it was this that 
made me especially want to play 
such a large role in the student 
government.

Campus mourns loss of Mimi Lerner, voice
by Claire Morgenstern
News Editor
Mimi Lerner, head of the 
voice department, renowned 
opera star, and Carnegie Mellon 
alumna, died on March 29 at her 
Oakland home after a 12-year 
battle with cancer. She was 61.
Lerner received her masters 
degree in voice from Carnegie 
Mellon. She went on to perform 
with opera companies around 
the world, including the Metro
politan Opera in New York.
When Mimi was still a gradu
ate student, there was so much 
buzz about her that the gradu
ate recital had to be moved 
off campus, to Synod Hall, to 
accommodate all the people 
who were expected to attend, 
said Riccardo Schulz, associate
teaching professor.
Robert Page, professor of mu
sic and director of choral/opera 
studies, conducted Lerners per
formance of Orfeo in the Opera 
Theatre of Pittsburgh in 1975. 
The theater was founded by 
Mildred Miller Posvar, artist lec
turer in voice and Lerners long
time mentor.
I told my manager about 
her, and she nurtured her along 
the way, Posvar said. She was 
such an example to all of us in so 
many ways. She was a woman 
who had such passion within her 
that it exuded in her perform
ing. That is so memorable in my 
mind  she could move people 
to tears through the wonderful 
communication of the text.
Kenneth Keeling, professor 
and former head of the School 
of Music, emphasized Lerners
commitment to her students.
We had a number of meet
ings ... as she sought to perfect 
every aspect of her service as a 
faculty member. I will never for
get how impressed I was with the 
depth of her commitment to her 
students while still working for 
uncommonly high standards for 
her own musical performance, 
Keeling said.
[Mimi] was the kind of per
son who would walk into a room 
and people would instantly fall 
in love with her. Her strength 
was that she made everyone 
feel at ease, which is so impor
tant when you are working with 
students, said Stephen Totter, 
artist lecturer.
Lerners students exuded sim
ilar praise.
When I think of Mimi, I dont 
think of her as a professor first;
I think of her as a dear friend, 
a mentor. She taught with a 
beautiful spirit and unbeliev
able grace. She was a brilliant 
woman inside and out, said 
Alexa Devlin, a first-year voice 
major and one of Mimis stu
dents at the time of her death.
I had the privilege to have 
coached with her on the role 
of Bradamante in Alcina. Those 
coachings were so inspiring 
and uplifting. She always had 
so much energy and spunk and 
spirit. I always looked forward 
to those coachings and got so 
much from them, said Chrystal 
Williams, a junior voice major.
Sophomore voice major Adam 
Richardson described Lerner as 
a factor in his decision to enroll 
at Carnegie Mellon.
Mimi called my house in 
April of 2005 to see if I was com
ing to CMU. I felt as though this 
woman must have seen some
thing special inside of me tht 
I didnt see, and I should go to 
CMU, Richardson said.
On March 29, students, fac
ulty, and staff from the School 
of Music gathered in Kresge 
Hall to mourn the passing of 
their colleague, teacher, men
tor, and friend.
I have never experienced 
anything like the devasta
tion at the voice faculty and 
students shared in Kresge, 
Posvar said. We just tried to 
console each other and stood 
and spoke up. Faculty spoke up 
with memories of Mimi. It was 
a wonderful healing event but 
excruciatingly painful. I had 
never experienced anything 
like it before. This was a special 
person, this really truly was.

University invests in new CIO
by Matthew E. Campbell
Copy Manager
Last month, Carnegie Mellons 
newly appointed treasurer and 
chief investment officer, Edward 
Grefenstette, took office.
Grefenstette, a native of Pitts
burgh who received his MBA 
from the Tepper School of Busi
ness in 1998, stated that he was 
very pleased to be back at Carn
egie Mellon.
Grefenstette has been ap
plauded by members of Tepper.
The appointment of Ed 
Grefenstette reflects Eds out
standing qualifications. His 
appointment also reflects the rig
orous nature of the MBA program 
at the Tepper School, where our 
alumni are prepared to make an 
immediate and sustained impact 
in the world, stated John Sengenberger, director of alumni /or 
the Tepper School.
In his new position, Grefen
stette will execute policies 
decided upon by the Investment 
Committee of the Board of Trust
ees, which invests funds from the 
universitys endowment.
This is a task at which Grefen
stette is very experienced: He 
was cofounder and managing 
director of Commonwealth Capi
tal Group, LP, a private equity 
investment firm.
The success of the universitys 
investments during the six-year 
term of John Mazur, the previous 
treasurer, was mixed.
During the 2003 fiscal year, the 
universitys investments grew at 
a slow rate of 2.3 percent, accord
ing to the 2003 annual report. 
However, this was an improve
ment over the last two years, 
when the universitys invest
ments lost value.
In 2003, the endowment made 
up only 5 percent (an amount 
fixed by the Board of Trustees) 
of the universitys operating rev
enue. Tuition and fees, on the 
other hand, made up 34 percent. 
Because the amount of money 
that can be taken from the en
dowment each year is limited, the 
rest has to be made up through 
research and alumni giving.
Grefenstettes primary goal, he 
stated, is to continue the growth 
of the universitys endowment. 
Since 2001, the endowment has 
increased 30 percent to approxi
mately $1 billion. While setting 
tuition rates is outside the juris
diction of the treasury, a larger 
endowment could mean less 
reliance on tuition rates to fund 
university activity.
Still, we all understand 
that the universitys strategic 
objective of strengthening the 
endowments contribution to 
the operating budget will cer
tainly support the efforts to 
control tuition levels in the fu
ture, Grefenstette stated.
Every student has heard Carn
egie Mellons Cinderella story: 
The university started as a re
gional technical school and grew 
to a top-25 university in less than 
100 years. However, the univer
sitys endowment has not grown 
as quickly. While Carnegie Mel

World Reports Best Colleges of

that pass by listen to the names 
being read for up to 15 minutes. It 
is a powerful statement of where 
the world has been, where it is 
going, and how it should be.
Yom Ha-Shoah, meaning day 
of sacrifice, is an international 
remembrance day of the Holo
caust established by Israeli law 
in 1959. Every year, the holiday 
falls on the 27th day of the month 
Nisan in the Hebrew calendar. 
This year, Yom Ha-Shoah aligns 
exactly with the annual Day of 
Silence on April 18. The Day of 
Silence is a demonstration against 
GLBT segregation, harassment, 
and bullying within school com
munities. Participants refuse to 
talk to mimic the metaphorical 
silence faced by members of the 
GLBT community.
This year, the JUC opted to 
hold Holocaust Remembrance 
Week prior to April 18 because 
of the original days proximity to 
Spring Carnival. The group felt
that the commemoration of the 
Holocaust would not have the 
same impact on the community if 
it were followed immediately by 
Carnival.
Members of Amnesty Interna
tional hoped to have the same 
kind of impact on the community. 
However, while Rush emphasized 
that Jewish culture is a reflection 
of the past, Amnesty Interna
tional president Nessa French 
underscored the importance of 
raising awareness of atrocities 
that are happening right now.
French is a sophomore major
ing in philosophy.
We put up signs in conjunc
tion with JUC and Allies because 
were remembering a past geno
cide, but we also want people to 
be aware of current genocides, 
she said.
Amnesty International aims 
to increase awareness of the 
genocide taking place in Darfur, 
Sudan. The organization is hold
ing a march and rally on April 18 
to increase the visibility of the is
sue and encourage more people 
to get involved.
Never again, one of the 
many messages displayed on 
the signs along the Cut, reflects 
the missions of both Amnesty 
International and the JUC 
regarding the Holocaust and the 
current genocide in Sudan.
Rush emphasized that it is im
portant to take action to remind 
the public that the events of the 
Holocaust should never be toler
ated again.
You can live your entire life 
and never have an impact on any
one, and to me that doesnt seem 
to be a life well-lived, Rush said. 
A life well-lived is one where 
you endeavor to understand 
the cultures of different people, 
where they are coming from, and 
where they have lived. It does not 
signify ignorance if these things 
arent known, but it is important 
to know what other peoples ex
periences are and how that has 
bought them to where they are 
now.
Due to lack of interest, board post
pones student government elections
ELECTION, from A1
of student cultural groups. The 
pairs third idea is to implement 
a new speaker series.
If we could just reallocate 
some of the funds from the of
ten niche speakers we seem to 
feature and put them into more 
universal speakers, like Steve 
Jobs for example, we could get 
the attention of students from 
different disciplines, Weinstock 
said.
The pairs fourth goal is to in
crease use of the Tartan-Wiki, 
a database for all student orga
nizations started by the current 
president and vice president to 
promote institutional memory.
The final component of Wein
stock and Jains platform is the 
Greek Initiative, in which the 
two plan to dispel myths about 
Greek life and integrate the 
1000 .students who participate 
in Greek life into the larger cam
pus community.
In addition, Weinstock and 
Jain have a sixth goal that they 
believe will be more difficult to 
implement.
Inspired by first-year aca
demic policies at competing 
institutions such as MIT, Johns 
Hopkins University, and Brown 
University, Weinstock and Jain 
would like to bring up the idea 
of pass/fail grading options for 
first-year students. The main ob
jective of this program would be 
to allow first-year students some 
time to adjust to a college set
ting and not immediately delve 
into the high-stress world of 
Carnegie Mellon.
However, Weinstock and Jain 
said that if elected, their impact 
would not be limited to these 
issues.
We want to emphasize that 
there clearly are more than five 
issues, Weinstock said. How
ever, we believe these to provide 
an excellent starting point and 
that other issues, such as the 
PAT changes, we will address as 
they come to us.
The pairs competitors, Ea
ton and Fasehun, have just as 
extensive a platform. Issues 
they propose to tackle include
restructuring environmen
tal policy, reforming campus 
transportation, and increas
ing student interaction during 
events like Homecoming.
Like their fellow candidates, 
both Eaton and Fasehun have 
had their fair share of leadership 
experience on campus.
Eaton served as finance chair 
of Student Senate his sophomore 
year. He is currently a member of 
the Joint Funding Commitee and 
a brother of Phi Kappa Theta.
Fasehun is the founder of wom
ens leadership groups Strong 
Women, Strong Girls, and 85 
Broads. She is also the president 
of the Pre-Law Society, a writer 
for The Triple Helix, an eco-rep, 
a sexual assault advisor, and a 
member of both the Presidents 
Student Advisory Council and 
the Modern Languages Student 
Advisory Commitee.
As a fifth-year scholar, I have 
already seen almost four years 
of the CMU community, and I 
feel like this role would just be 
a culmination of my whole CMU 
experience, Fasehun said.
Eaton and Fasehun hope to 
build on current sustainability 
policies and increase student 
involvement in this university 
mission.
We have this great program 
that gets students papers for 
free, for example, Eaton said. 
But then there are barely any 
recycling bins on campus to 
dispose of the papers when fin
ished.
They also plan to restructure 
the current Safewalk and Carn
egie Mellon shuttle systems.
In addition, the pair plans to 
increase collaboration between 
Carnegie Mellon faculty, ad
ministrators, and students by 
enforcing the campus morato
rium.
We have always had a mora
torium from 4:30 to 6:30 each 
weekday in which students are 
supposed to be free of classes 
and all academic commitments, 
Eaton said. Yet, this is rarely en
forced and even known about by 
many students.
They also plan to increase 
school spirit by increasing fund
ing for club sports, promoting 
the use of the Tartan-Wiki, and 
publicizing the arts and cul
ture opportunities on and off 
campus.
We have so many resources 
here on campus, Fasehun said. 
It is key that the students know 
so they can take advantage of 
them.
All six candidates praised the 
campus bike initiative as one 
that brought the campus com
munity together.
We would love to have every 
day show our year-round com
munity with Frisbees, painting, 
and tons of people outside, not 
just special days like that, Ea
ton said.
Eaton and Fasehun hope to 
improve campus-wide events. 
They plan to add a dance and 
crowning of Homecoming king 
and queen in an effort to attract 
more students to the event. They 
hope to use this event and to 
foster diversity and leadership 
among students.
They hope to institute a blog 
where students will have the op
portunity to post their thoughts, 
ideas, and feedback.
If elected, they also aim to im
prove Student Senate itself.
It is almost a tragedy that 
Student Senate gives out over 
$80,000 each year, yet could 
only garner 10 petitions out of 
30 needed, Eaton said.
Eaton and Fasehun have sug
gested filling the representative 
vacancies with members of dif
ferent colleges. However, this 
change would complicate things; 
A CIT student acting as a repre
sentative for CFA, for example, 
must have the support of CFA 
students in order to be elected to 
represent that groups interests 
in the campus community.
While the future of the Stu
dent Senate is not yet clear, 
Sjogren is confident that his suc
cessors, whoever they are, will 
have a positive impact.
Regardless of whos elected, I 
think, and I really hope, that stu
dent government will continue 
on its course to being a more 
visible section of the campus 
community, he said.

Internships not the only option this summer, experts say
Its not the job that matters; its the skills the student gains as a result. Here are some creative internship alternatives.
INTERNSHIPS, from A1
nine-to-five route when deciding 
on a position.
That term internship can 
be interpreted many different 
ways. Every higher-ed institution 
is going to have a different term 
for it, Timko said. Students 
should take advantage of any 
opportunity that will give them 
leadership experience and pro
fessional development.
There are a variety of alter
natives for students looking to 
develop skills without enter
ing a traditional internship. Re
search and working with faculty 
members are popular ways that 
students gain experience by fur
ther exploring their major or 
hobbies. The Undergraduate Re
search Office awards fall, spring, 
and summer grants to help pay 
for expenses, as well as $3000 
grants for full-time summer re
search fellowships. Working 
part-time also enables students 
to earn extra money while gain
ing real-world job experience.
Timko also points out the ad
vantages of working on campus. 
Campus employment is a great 
way for students to gain expe
rience in the workplace, said 
Timko. While these activities 
may not be traditional intern
ships, they offer students the 
same opportunity to develop
skills that will be useful in their 
future careers.
Carnegie Mellon students 
arent waiting around for the 
perfect company internship to 
present itself, either. Instead, 
several campus organizations 
are creating their own unique in
ternship experiences. Students in 
Free Enterprise (SIFE), an under
graduate business organization 
on campus, works together to 
create outreach projects and 
compete with other SIFE groups 
in national and regional com
petitions. The competitions are 
often judged by corporate board 
members, which gives students 
the opportunity to connect and 
network with potential future 
employers.
The International Association 
for the Exchange of Students for 
Technical Experience (IAESTE) 
is another student organization 
creating unique internship ex
periences for students. IAESTE
works with other domestic and 
worldwide IAESTE chapters to 
help students land international 
technical internships. The intern
ships serve a wide range of ma
jors. While IAESTE internships 
often supply funds for housing 
and food, the emphasis is on the 
cultural experience of working 
abroad.
Going abroad is something 
that everyone should be able to 
do, said Angela Moy, a junior 
business administration major 
and local committee president of 
IAESTE. You experience so much 
more and you find out what your 
limits are. It challenges you and 
really teaches you how to survive 
on your own. It makes you more 
tolerant to other cultures.
For students working within 
the United States, the univer
sity offers a limited number of 
summer grants to help fund ex
penses. The Milton and Cynthia 
Friedman Grants and the Thomas
Johnson Engineering and Public 
Policy Fellowship allow funding 
for students interning in Wash
ington, D.C. over the summer. 
The Dozzi Grant gives money to 
students working in Pittsburgh 
organizations. There" are also 
summer opportunity grants for 
H&SS students. The grants are 
given to sophomores and juniors
with strong academic records.
Housing, travel, and food 
are some of the additional ex
penses that students will have 
to consider. Wallach emphasized 
that grants may not cover all 
expenses.
There are some opportunities 
for financial support from the uni
versity, but either way if you have 
to move and support yourself in 
a different city, its an expensive 
proposition,-Wallach said.
Regardless of whether stu
dents choose an internship, re
search, or an on-campus job, it 
is important for students to seek
out opportunities that show in
volvement, development, and 
community leadership in order 
to create a well-rounded under
graduate experience.
Students should demonstrate 
leadership capacity on campus or 
in the community. Todays most 
competitive employers look for 
students who are not only ac
tive participants on campus, but 
are leaders. Whether they are 
directly related to your major, 
or can supplement it, I would 
recommend getting involved, 
Baker stated.
While these additional activi
ties do provide assistance when 
landing a future job, the best 
preparation for post-graduation 
is the effort students put into aca
demics, Wallach said.
Students most importantly 
have to put their academics in 
the center of things and then 
from that point on they need to 
start looking at how they want 
to contribute to the campus and 
the community, Wallach said. 
There are many ways to connect 
on campus to broaden the scope 
of your experience here. Thats 
what internships are, thats what 
research experience is, as well as 
many of the campus activities. 
You just want to be able to look 
back at your undergraduate years 
and say, this is what I did, this is 
what I accomplished.
New CIO 
starts term
INVESTMENT, from A3
2007, the National Association 
of College and University Busi
ness Officers ranked Carnegie 
Mellon 69th among colleges 
and universities in regard to its 
endowment in 2006.
In contrast, the University of 
Pittsburgh was ranked 57th aca
demically by U.S. News despite 
having an endowment ranked 
28th by the National Association 
of College and University Busi
ness Officers.
[CMU] has done a terrific job 
of making the most of the money 
we have, which is sometimes 
referred to as endowment ef
ficiency. The university has, in 
fact, achieved and maintained 
an impressive standard of excel
lence with far fewer funds than 
many other elite institutions, 
Grefenstette said.
Grefenstette also feels that 
the university is well-positioned 
for expansion. The university 
funds new buildings on cam
pus and renovations to existing 
structures through private do
nations but usually by issuing 
university bonds.
The rating agency Standard 
and Poors renewed Carnegie 
Mellons AAbond rating for
2006, which affirmed the over
all strength and stability of the 
university, Grefenstette stated.
That term internship can be interpreted many different 
ways... Students should take advantage of any opportunity 
that will give them professional development.

Officials to keep 28X and 500, eliminate 501 as of June 17 in latest PAT decision
TRANSIT, from A1
routes serving the Oakland com
munity that were originally to 
be eliminated will now be re
tained. These routes are the 500, 
61F, 67E, and 69A. One Oakland 
route, the 501, will be discontin
ued under the new plan.
Despite the Port Authoritys 
money troubles, Carnegie Mel
lon students will continue to 
receive the same discount on 
public transportation.
Although our contract pro
vides for unlimited access at 
the negotiated price, our annual 
rides exceed one million which
equates to only about 70 cents 
per ride compared to PATs cur
rent base fares which range from 
$1.75 to $2.75, stated Jennifer 
Church, dean of student affairs, 
via e-mail. It is expected that 
our contract will maintain simi
lar terms for the upcoming year 
as in past years, which usu
ally includes a modest increase 
around four to five percent.
However, regular Pittsburgh 
residents who rely on the bus 
system arent as lucky.
We must remember that the 
[Pennsylvania Transportation 
Funding and Reform Commis
sion] recognized a significant
shortfall of state and local fund
ing to sustain current transit 
system operations throughout 
Pennsylvania, said Steve Bland, 
Port Authority CEO, in a series of 
remarks to the board of directors 
during a meeting on March 30. 
Despite community disagree
ments over our service plans or 
internal changes, this fact re
mains unchanged and we must 
all begin to unite around a strat
egy that achieves a longterm so
lution.
In addition to the service cuts, 
the board approved a series of 
internal cost reductions, includ
ing freezing the salaries of Bland
and Port Authoritys senior staff, 
restricting benefits and pension 
plans, and reducing the compa
nys staff, according to a March 
30 Port Authority press release.
The cuts have been met with 
opposition by riders and activist 
groups, such as Save Our Transit. 
On March 29, the group gathered 
outside across the street from 
Port Authoritys main offices in 
the Heinz building downtown 
to put pressure on the board of 
directors to vote against the pro
posed service reductions.
We as transit riders and sup
porters wanted to show our 
support for the transit system in
hopes that the board would vote 
no on the 15 percent cuts, said 
Amanda Zeiders, chairperson of 
Save Our Transit.
Zeiders estimated that about 
30 people attended the event.
While the vigil ultimately 
did not affect the boards deci
sion, customers have made an 
impact by participating in pub
lic hearings and sending public 
comments. Port Authority re
ported that 13,000 Pittsburgh 
residents, business leaders, and 
local government officials at
tended a series of public hearings 
held by PAT between January 22 
and February 7. In addition, the
company received over 22,000 
comments from concerned citi
zens. Of the comments, 1240 
were in support of the 28X, ac
cording to the Post-Gazette.
While Zeiders and members of 
Save Our Transit recognize the 
companys need for reform, they 
believe there are other ways be
sides instituting service cuts.
Wed like Port Authority to 
take a different approach com
pletely, Zeiders said. Wed like 
to see them increase ridership, 
increase service, to be more ef
ficient in that respect.
The Port Authority could not 
be reached for comment.

Magnets at CERN 
fail in test
The inner triplet of magnets 
within CERN, the worlds largest 
particle collider, burst during a 
high-pressure test on March 27, 
potentially resulting in its com
pletion being delayed.
According to both CERN and 
Fermilab, the U.S.-based pro
ducer of the magnets, there was 
an imbalance in forces that had 
not been considered, which re
sulted in the magnets failing un
der high pressure. No staff were 
harmed in the accident.
The particle collider was orig
inally scheduled to begin opera
tion in November 2007. How
ever, a spokesperson said that it 
is too early to tell if this schedule 
can be maintained. Another test 
is scheduled for June 1. Scien
tists have continued to develop 
the Large Hadron Collider.
Among experiments sched
uled to begin when CERN is 
operational are probes into the 
properties of dark matter and 
the origins of the universe. The 
tunnel, which is 17 miles long, 
will house particle collisions 
that are meant to imitate the big

Tropical storms 
predicted for 2007
Forecasters from Colorado 
State University predict that 17 
tropical storms, including nine 
hurricanes, will occur between 
the months of June and Novem
ber. Five of these hurricanes are 
expected to be of at least Cat
egory 3, and wind speeds are 
expected to be over 110 mph.
Tropical Storm Risk, a fore
caster located in London, also 
predicts nine hurricanes for the 
season, as well as up to 17 tropi
cal storms. If the predictions 
hold, storms this year may rival 
the devastation of 2005, when 
Hurricane Katrina caused more 
than $80 billion in damage 
along the coast.
Last year, there were only
10 tropical storms, including 
five hurricanes; this was likely 
because of an El Nio system 
that caused more storms in the 
Pacific. This year, a La Nia sys
tem means that there will be 
more storms in the Atlantic. Re
searchers from Colorado State 
claim that there is a 74 percent 
probability that the U.S. will ex
perience a major hurricane this 
year.

Religion may have 
genetic aspects
A study published by Laura 
Koenig in the Journal of Person
ality indicates that religion and 
selfless behavior may be a result 
of genetic predisposition.
No single gene was identified 
to influence spirituality. How
ever, the study showed that in
dividuals act in certain ways be
cause of their genetic makeup. 
Researchers found that the cor
relation between altruistic and 
religious personalities is due to 
both environmental and genetic 
factors.
A field of science called 
neurotheology has emerged 
around the investigation of how 
the human brain processes reli
gion and spirituality. This field 
studies similarities between 
religious practices across the 
globe, as well as the effect that 
religious activities have upon 
the limbic system, the part of 
the human brain that regulates 
ones emotions and sense o 
well-being.
Researchers at the University 
of Pennsylvania performed the 
studies using brain-scanning

How Things Work: Carbon-14 Dating
A6 THE TARTAN
Sarah Mogin
While some college students might 
have trouble figuring out how long that 
Pad Thais been sitting in the refrigera
tor, scientists can use carbon-14 dating to 
determine the age of materials as old as
60.000 years.
Carbon-14 dating, or radiocarbon dat
ing, uses the amount of carbon-14 in a 
substance to calculate its age.
Scientists can detect the amount of car
bon in a material using a process called 
mass spectronomy, where a magnetic 
field is used to direct particles toward a 
sheet of metal with a tiny slit. The mag
netic field will curve the paths of the less 
massive particles to a greater extent than 
those of the more massive particles, and 
the slit is placed so that only the particles 
with the desired mass (that of carbon-14) 
will go through it.
Carbon-14 dating was developed in 
1949 by Willard Libby, who later won the 
Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discov
ery and advancement of the procedure.
Radiocarbon ages  those deter
mined by carbon-14 dating  are often 
labeled as years BP (Before Present), 
which means years before 1950. This 
scale reflects the level of carbon-14 in the 
atmosphere in 1950, as determined by 
Libby and his team.
Currently, the maximum ages scientists 
are able to determine using carbon-14 
dating are within the range of 50,000 to
62.000 years.
Carbon-14 dating is commonly used 
to determine the ages of old artifacts 
such as mummies. For example, ages 
determined by carbon-14 dating were 
included in a traveling exhibit called The 
Mysterious Bog People, which visited the 
Carnegie Museum of Natural History 
July 2005 through January 2006.
The exhibit featured seven bog bod
ies, mummified for thousands of years 
within the peat bogs of Northern Europe. 
The airless bog environment is a natural 
mummifier, preserving both skin and|-------- -----------_J_
in living things; once an organism dies, 
it ceases to gain new carbon dioxide and 
loses remaining carbon dioxide through 
a process called beta decay.
Beta decay, more formally radioactive 
beta decay, is a process by which carbon14 produces nitrogen-14 by emitting an 
electron and anti-neutrino (a neutral par
ticle produced during the decay). Here, 
carbon-14 is called a parent isotope, 
which decays to produce a daughter 
isotope, nitrogren-14.
When dealing with radioactive decay, 
scientists often speak of half-lives, the 
amount of time it takes for a substance to 
decrease to half its original amount. The 
half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years, plus 
or minus 40 years.
If you know how much carbon-14 was 
originally present in a given substance, 
and how much there is left, you can plug 
these values into an equation and solve 
for time. Essentially, this is how scien
tists use carbon-14 to determine the age 
of a material.
The amount of carbon-14 in the Earths 
atmosphere, however, is a fluctuating 
quantity. Solar storms can affect the in
tensity of cosmic rays, which affect the 
rate of carbon-14 production.
Also, following the carbon cycle, 
carbon-14 is present in the ocean and 
sedimentary rocks. When the climate 
changes, it sometimes affects the trans
fer of carbon between these reservoirs 
and the atmosphere.
Humans can affect these changes as 
well. In the 50s and 60s, atomic bomb 
tests nearly doubled the amount of 
carbon-14 present in the atmosphere. 
Recently, however, the quantity has been 
reduced as a result of fossil fuels, which 
do not release carbon-14.
With all of these influences, it is nec
essary to calibrate radiocarbon ages. 
Scientists use the growth rings of trees, 
samples of coral, cave deposits, and 
other sources to determine the amount 
of carbon-14 present in the atmosphere 
at a given time._______________i

often call the police, mistaking a wellpreserved, thousand-year-old body for a

Mellon College of Science has 
created the Astrid and Bruce 
McWilliams Fellowship to sup
port graduate students who are 
pursuing scientific research. The 
fellowship is funded by a $1 mil
lion gift from Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus Bruce McWilliams and 
his wife Astrid McWilliams.
McWilliams received his B.S., 
masters and Ph.D. (1981) in 
physics at Carnegie Mellon.
The McWilliams Fellowship 
will pay for the tuition and fees 
of three doctoral students. The 
fellowship lasts for one year, be
ginning in July.
Rea Freeland, associate dean 
for special projects for the Mel
lon College of Science, said the 
McWilliamses wanted to sup
port advances in research areas 
important to the college, includ
ing nanotechnology, which is 
important both to Bruce McWil
liams and to Mellon College of 
Science.
Freeland said that McWilliams 
is interested in helping Mel
lon College of Science achieve 
its goals. Freeland stated in an 
e-mail, He wants to support our 
ongoing initiatives and catalyze 
great progress on those while he 
also supports excellent graduate 
students.
McWilliams said that he hopes 
the fellowship will contribute to 
education and meet the needs of 
society and industry.
I think it will make the uni
versity more competitive, 
McWilliams added.
McWilliams said that before 
making his donation, he first 
asked President Cohon what 
would most benefit the univer
sity. McWilliams said that many 
graduate students are not funded 
internally, and the new fellow
ship is meant to allow students 
and their professors expand their 
research.
In particular, the fellow
ship is intended for students 
who are conducting research 
in nanotechnology, biophysics, 
and cosmology.
Thats a personal interest of 
mine, he said.
McWilliams is CEO, president 
and chairman of Tessera Tech
nologies, which is headquartered 
in Silicon Valley and has offices 
around the world.
Tessera Technologies con
structs parts for various types 
of electronics, including MP3 
players, computers, and hearing 
implants.
We do all kinds of things with 
materials, McWilliams said.
According to a Carnegie Mel
lon press release, three students 
were selected to receive the 
fellowship, and they all con
duct different types of research.
Chemistry doctoral student 
Andrea Benvin is researching 
fluorescent DNA nanotags, for 
which she was published in the 
January issue of the Journal of 
the American Chemical Society. 
Fluorescent nanotags are bright 
labels on DNA molecules that 
enable researchers to detect can
cerous cells.
Haifeng Gao, another chem
istry doctoral student, is 
researching polymeric nanogels. 
Nanogels are insulation materi
als that may, in Gaos research, 
influence drug delivery.
Physics doctoral student Sandeep Gaan, on the other hand, is 
studying the surface of semicon
ductors using scanning tunnel 
microscopy. Freeland said that 
the McWilliams Fellowship will 
allow Gaan to direct more atten
tion toward studying pentacene 
molecules on the surface of semi
conductors. Pentacene molecules 
are special types of hydrocar
bons, compounds that consist of 
hydrogen and carbon atoms.
Meeting the students was a 
rewarding experience for me, 
McWilliams said.
According to Freeland, one of 
the benefits of receiving this fel
lowship is that the recipients do 
not have to become teaching as
sistants. She said that the fellow
ship also provides graduate stu
dents with greater flexibility in 
conducting their research.
The McWilliams [Fellow
ship] is the largest endowed 
gift in recent years for graduate 
fellowships in MCS, Freeland 
said. She noted that the physics 
department received a signifi
cant gift in 2005 from the estate 
of George Pake that also sup
ported doctoral students.
The McWilliams Fellowship 
also includes $1000 for travel to

Free your music
EMI music label will begin to offer music free of digital rights management software
Attack on bilingual education 
lacks cultural awareness
The Beatles once sang You say you 
want a revolution/Well, you know/ 
We all want to change the world. Last 
week, The Beatles record label, EMI, 
took a big step toward changing the 
world  at least the world of digital me
dia  for the better.
Last Monday in London, EMI, one of 
the big four record labels in the music 
industry (the others being Sony BMG, 
Warner Music Group, and Universal 
Music Group), announced a shocking 
change in its digital music sales strategy: 
The company will begin offering its en
tire catalog of music on iTunes without 
any digital rights management (DRM) 
software, for an extra 30 cents tacked 
on to the price tag of each song.
Since Apple first launched its iTunes 
Music Store in 2003, every single song 
it sold has been laced with a technol
ogy called FairPlay. This software limits 
the songs playback capabilities; you 
can only play it through iTunes or on an 
iPod, or burn it to a CD. Nothing else was 
capable of playing it. It was tied to your 
e-mail address, with which you could au
thorize up to five computers to play any
East Carson
After a long week of grueling problem 
sets or headaches, on the job, many a col
lege student or local Pittsburgher seeks 
respite in the cool comfort of a couple 
of drinks at a local bar. On East Carson 
Street, in Pittsburghs popular South 
Side neighborhood, there are plenty of 
bars to choose from.
In fact, the Pennsylvania Tourism 
Office says that on East Carson there 
are more bars per capita than almost any 
other place on earth. To many college 
students and Pittsburgh enthusiasts, 
the billions of bars crowding the South 
Side seem more like a bragging right 
than a civic problem. Unfortunately, 
Pittsburghs City Planning Commission 
doesnt feel the same way.
The commission has voted unani
mously to recommend that the City 
Council pass a bill that would prohibit 
the distribution of new liquor licenses 
for establishments that are within 150 
feet of two existing licensed bars on East 
Carson Street.
song linked to your account. If you tried 
to play the song on a non-authorized 
computer, you would receive an error 
message.
And so, in almost four years, nothing 
changed in the system. Apple sold hun
dreds of millions of iPods and more than 
two billion songs on iTunes, and hardly 
anyone batted an eyelash. For users, 
songs worked with their iPod and with 
their computer, and thats all that really 
mattered. Several foreign governments 
started recognizing Apples dominance 
in the music sales field as a monopoly of 
sorts, and demanded they allow other 
music stores to use their FairPlay en
cryption, in order to loosen the grip of 
the iPod-iTunes hegemony.
The music industry repeatedly 
shrugged off claims from a vocal minor
ity that its insistence on DRM technology 
was hurting consumers. When Sonys 
rootkit security debacle compromised 
thousands of computers thanks to the 
companys own brand of DRM in 2005, 
the concept of DRM encryption reached 
the public  and while there was a brief 
outcry at the time, the issue, and the
The proposed bill comes in the wake 
of growing complaints among South 
Side residents that bar patrons rowdy 
behavior is a disruptive force within the 
neighborhood. Also cited among resi
dents complaints was the apparent lack 
of available parking in the area.
Arresting the growth of one of 
Pittsburghs most attractive and vibrant 
neighborhoods does not bode well for 
the future of the city, nor will it solve 
the existing problems of raucous behav
ior and an absence of parking.
Especially with the citys brain drain
 talented youth bleeding out of the 
city at an alarming pace  it seems as 
though Pittsburgh should be doing all it 
can to keep itself attractive to a younger 
demographic. In competing for smart 
young things against metropolises like 
New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles, 
Pittsburgh has a long way to go before it 
can even begin to stack up against their 
efficient public transportation or hum
ming social scenes.
technology, soon faded. The party line, 
that customers wanted their music crip
pled with DRM, continued.
So imagine the publics surprise when 
the CEO of EMI, Eric Niccli, announced 
that starting next month, every single 
song from EMI available on iTunes was 
going to be sold without any encryption 
and with higher-quality sound for $1.29, 
as opposed to the standard 99 cents persong price. Normal, FairPlay-compliant 
versions of the tracks would still be 
available for 99 cents, and the full-album 
pricing structure would remain intact, 
even with the higher-quality tracks.
Steve Jobs was quoted last week by 
Gizmodo, a personal technology blog, as 
saying that he expected more than half 
the songs on iTunes in DRM-free ver
sions by the end of the year. Microsoft, 
too, is likely to follow suit and offer 
DRM-free songs for its fledgling Zune 
platform. This past week saw a wel
come change to how the music industry 
regards its customers, and one can only 
hope that the rest of the market follows 
EMIs forward-looking decision that 
benefits consumers.
Most importantly, South Side resi
dents complaints could be addressed 
without implementing drastic policy 
changes. Crowd control could be man
aged by upping the number of security 
guards at bars or the amount of police 
presence in the area at nighttime. In 
regards to the parking problems in the 
neighborhood, passing the proposed 
bill to limit new liquor licenses is an in
credibly roundabout way of decreasing 
traffic in the region. Furthermore, park
ing is always difficult to find in cities 
and is still far easier in Pittsburgh than 
in many other urban meccas that are 
more populated.
Lets keep the lawmakers out of this 
situation. The South Side is an impor
tant part of Pittsburghs economy and 
character, and certainly provides a fun 
and interesting atmosphere worth pre
serving. In a city overwhelmed by snow 
and rain showers, East Carson Street is 
certainly a ray of sunshine. Well drink 
to that.

Language is active. It is dynamic. 
Its function and form evolve with the 
changing needs and uses of communi
cation in society. It allows for a sense of 
unity; it expresses culture. Language 
highlights difference and variety, and 
when properly respected, can be used 
to emphasize cultural uniqueness and 
appreciation. However, when its pur
pose is misunderstood, language can 
be used to segregate and subvert entire 
cultures.
Such cultural derision was recently 
committedby Newt Gingrich, the former 
speaker of the House and social blunderextraordinaire. In a March 31 article 
titled Abolish bilingual education, 
Gingrich urges, CNN.com reported that 
Gingrich equated bilingual education 
with the language of living in a ghetto. 
According to the ever socially conscious 
political orator, English should not only 
be the official language of the United 
States, but immigrants should be forced 
to abandon their native language (and, 
subsequently, their native culture) and 
be educated only in English  whether 
or not they understand it.
First of all, what does the language 
of living in a ghetto even mean? This 
statement is nothing but derogatory. Is 
he talking about ghetto as an infor
mal manner of speech or as an actual
low-income housing region? Either 
way, its insulting. If anything, cultural 
awareness  that respecting ones na
tive language encourages  which is 
promoted by recent immigrants con
tinuing to communicate in a language 
other than English, should be encour
aged in public education rather than 
wholly squandered.
And what about diversity? Gingrich 
told the National Federation of Re
publican Women that The American 
people believe English should be the 
official language of the government. 
This follows his 1995 comment that 
bilingualism (perhaps not even just in 
terms of education) poses long-term 
dangers to the fabric of our nation and 
is very dangerous.
Yes, the concept of people learning in 
multiple languages, rather than one, so 
that they can truly succeed is terrifying. 
How can we remain homogeneous and 
judgmental if we have to sit next to other 
students who are also learning in Span
ish? I mean, if the kid who takes math in 
Spanish and history in English can now 
compete at my level (you know, since he 
can actually learn math in a language 
he understands), then what if he does 
better than me? According to Gingrich, 
that would destroy the entire fabric of 
our countrys culture!
Gingrich went on in his speech to 
mock the federal requirement that 
voting ballots be printed in multiple 
languages in areas that are largely mul
tilingual. This, he insisted, is because 
Citizenship requires passing a test on 
American history in English. If thats 
true, then we do not have to create bal
lots in any language except English. 
Because, you know, that test always 
means that recent immigrants totally 
understand the language of the U.S. 
Why, Seor Gingrich, is it a bad thing 
to retain ones heritage and language? 
Why is bilingualism  understanding 
two languages, two cultures, two new 
ways of interpreting the world  such 
a bad thing?
The article noted the response to Gin
grich by Peter Zamora, cochair of the
Hispanic Education Coalition. Accord
ing to Zamora, the Coalition, which 
backs bilingual education, has research 
that shows that bilingual education is 
the best method of teaching English to 
non-English speakers.
Moreover, no one can claim that im
migrants are avoiding learning English 
at all. Zamora noted, Everyone wants 
to learn English because its what you 
need to thrive in this country. No one 
is hiding in their supposedly desolate, 
unwanted ghettos and devising ways 
to take down the English language, 
Gingrich. Theyre not conspiring to 
make sure every written word is writ
ten in Spanish. Your teleprompter wont 
suddenly be en espaol. But if it is, dont 
worry: The Spanish language only bites 
a little bit before running back to its 
ghetto, where it (of course) knows it 
belongs.
Besides the blatant racism being prop
agated by Seor Gringo  Im sorry, I 
mean Gingrich  the argument against 
bilingualism, particularly in schools, is 
potentially very damaging to American 
students. There is a ridiculous amount of 
evidence out there that shows that bilin
gualism, particularly in regards to two 
different forms of languages (Romantic 
versus Germanic, for example), teaches 
individuals, particularly children, to 
think in new and different ways. This 
means new thoughts, new ideas, and 
new ways to advance the world.
I dont want to ignore the counterargu
ment to my assertion that bilingualism
and bilingual education are, well, nec
essary. There are some logistically valid 
arguments against bilingual education, 
such as the problem of semi-lingualism 
and a lack of qualified teachers. Semilingualism relates to the idea of an in
dividual being near-fluent but not com
pletely comfortable in a new language, 
and also feeling subsequently alienated 
from his or her native culture after be
coming assimilated to the new one. I 
can also understand citing a need for a 
national language for a unified system 
of economic, political, and social com
munication, and maybe  just maybe
 to encourage American patriotism. 
However, even if such arguments are 
acceptable, Newt Gringo neither cites 
them nor proposes a solid argument. 
Rather than arguing in terms of these 
logistical difficulties of bilingual educa
tion, Gingrichs argument is tainted with 
white supremacist ideals and an unwill
ingness to encourage Americans to be 
culturally heterogeneous. He comes off 
as closed-minded and oppressive rather 
than well-reasoned or well-intentioned 
(or, you know, kind).
Instead of encouraging this system 
of oppressive hegemony and citing the 
use of the English language to back it, 
we as Americans need to be more cul
turally aware. Instead of aiming to dis
tance ourselves from the wide array of 
immigrant groups living and working 
in our nation, we need to realize that 
America is nothing without cultural 
diversity. The hegemony of a closedoff, culturally muted ruling class will 
do nothing but stunt our growth as a 
cultural world power. The English lan
guage itself is the result of the mixing 
of several other languages. Rather than 
using it to segregate the American ma
jority culture from other groups iden
tified by speaking other languages, we 
should use language to become cultur
ally aware and accepting, to understand 
other groups customs, and to be united
 not divided  as a nation.

Perspectives
Seniors should 
consider future 
alumni relations
Kart Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
As I checked the event sched
ule for graduation, I couldnt 
help but notice the free food and 
cash-bar party (on Sunday, May 
20) at the Pittsburgh Deli Com
pany. Sounds fun, but it was re
ally the title that caught my eye. 
Billed as a Zero-Year Reunion, 
the event got me thinking about 
the relationship alumni have to 
Carnegie Mellon.
As graduating seniors, we re
ceive new information almost 
weekly about special events or 
tasks we need to take care of in 
order to make sure were ready 
to receive our diploma. This is 
a good thing: We have the op
portunity to catch mistakes in 
our transcripts and learn about 
adult matters like buying versus 
renting a home. We have also 
received invitations to network
ing events. These are all great 
resources Carnegie Mellon pro
vides for us, and we are smart to 
take advantage of them.
Recently, the university has 
also moved its alumni database 
online, making networking 
much easier (see http://alumni. 
cm u.ed u/foryo u/c urre nt stu
dents/career.html). Seniors 
have received e-mails telling us 
about The Bridge, a guide for 
graduating students to make the 
transition to life outside of Carn
egie Mellon (http://alumni.cmu. 
e d u/fo ryou/alumnibenefits/ 
bridgenews.html). Theres also 
Linkedln, the premier profes
sional networking site, where 
you can join the Carnegie Mellon 
alumni group {http://link.edin. 
com).
This year, Alumni Relations 
has also begun to step it up. Led 
by Judith Cole and Roshawn 
Palmer, Alumni Relations re
cently began discussions with 
groups of students about our im
pressions of Alumni Relations, 
the contact we would like to have 
with alumni, and the contact we 
would like to have with the uni
versity after we graduate. This is 
a step in the right direction, and 
they bring up good questions. 
How do we want to shape our re
lationship with our alma mater, 
and with each other? How can 
Homecoming become more like 
Carnival? If you would like to 
share your input on these ques
tions or have other concerns, 
contact us at sbp@, or contact 
Alumni Relations directly at 
alumni-house+@andrew.cmu. 
edu.
Its time for us to take our leg
acy into our own hands.
An extra note: YOU should run 
for Student Senate, become a 
GSA rep, or run for student body 
president, VP, or VP of finance. 
Contact us at sbp@ and well be 
happy to tell you more! Petitions 
are due this Wednesday at 5 p.m.
 so get to the UC Info Desk to 
pick one up!

Social norms: Everyone
knows them. Dont chew with

lic. But are these rules really 
necessary? If youve got an itch 
that cant be ignored, is it not 
well within your right to scratch 
it?
What is it about the word nor
mal that makes people think its 
definable? There is nothing nor

human nature. The term is so 
relative that it differs slighdy for 
every single living thing. Whats 
normal to me (eating exorbitant 
amounts of Chinese food, gro

no means normal to the person 
living down the hall from me 
(HI!!!!!!).
Whenever you see a group of 
young kids out in public, at least 
one of them is picking their nose. 
Our parents ingrained in us the 
notion that this was a bad thing 
to do, probably because their 
parents did the same to them. 
And whenever you ask why, the 
response given is Its rude, or 
my personal favorite, Because. 
Its rude because people say it 
is, not because they actually 
believe it is. People are afraid of 
being ostracized, so they dont go 
against the grain.
Follow me on this one: 
Irrational codes of decorum 
lead to an overall resentment of 
authority figures and a popula
tion-wide decrease in imagina
tion. In the Disney movie The 
Lion King, Simba has an entire 
musical number dedicated to 
how much he detests being told 
what to do. In the end, Simba 
comes up with a clever plan
to reclaim his place as king. In 
between all this, Simba was in a 
beautiful jungle paradise with no 
parents and no constraints. Most 
important, Simba had the ability 
to grow unfettered, both physi
cally and mentally. Life turned 
out pretty well for Simba, and 
nobody died because he burped 
a lot.
Now, Ill be the first to say that, 
yes, some standards are good. 
Watching someone talk with their 
mouth full of food is one of the 
grossest things about day-to-day 
life. Most people shower and 
wear clothing. Hopefully thats 
because everyone realizes that 
the Garden of Eden is a little 
too idealistic to be imposed on 
todays world. If humans were 
not sentient beings, clothing 
wouldnt be an issue, but they 
are, so Modesty clothes us in 
whatever it can find. When a 
rule of propriety is based on logic 
or other rational thinking, I can 
agree with it, but there are just 
some expectations that can not 
even begin to be explained.
Burping, for instance; whether 
out loud or not, is widely con
sidered to be rude. Whether at 
the dinner table at home or else
where, anywhere a burp is heard, 
a resounding gross is heard 
after it. The thing is, the person 
who says gross burps, too. This 
kind of double standard (read: 
hypocrisy) leads me to believe 
that theres no actual reason for 
this ban on burping. In some cul
tures, burping is considered a 
compliment. If you appreciated 
the meal, show your thanks by 
sounding a resonant burp.
The same goes for passing gas, 
more colloquially known as fart
ing. Women do it. Men do it. Hell, 
even animals do it. If people are 
going to get huffy and upset every 
time someone lets one slip, then 
they should be consistent about it. 
All other bodily functions should
be equally detested: breathing, 
sneezing, yawning, going to the 
bathroom, bleeding. The list goes 
on. None of these things can be 
controlled, so society shouldnt 
try to control them, especially by 
imposing an unspoken morato
rium on them.
Even among close friends, 
social norms are still upheld, 
at least superficially. Someone 
burps and the group they are 
surrounded by erupts into laugh
ter amid groans of sick, nasty,
and dude, gross. They dont 
really mean it though. Its a 
trained reaction based on years 
of questionable parenting and 
even worse societal expectations. 
Your friends appreciate you for 
who you are, bodily processes 
included. Thats why theyre your 
friends, not parents or superiors.
Victims of this nonsense: 
Rejoice. You are not alone. I, too, 
have suffered countless looks 
just for being myself. I burp 
around my friends and yawn
Michael Menchaca/Art Staff
without covering my mouth. Im 
fine with it. There is nothing nicer 
than acting the way you were 
meant to act. It makes me feel 
good when the people around 
me are comfortable enough with 
me and, most importantly, them
selves, to burp, yawn, and snort 
in my presence.

most of Hollywood, all the 
way from movie production 
to distribution. Valenti, in an 
attempt to revolutionize movie 
watching, formed what we know 
today as the MPAA film rating 
system.
You see them everywhere: 
in movie trailers, before mov
ies, after movies, and in every 
advertisement for any movie that 
wants to have a fighting chance at 
the box office. This rating system 
is voluntary, and is allegedly 
designed to protect children from 
being corrupted by evil movies'. 
By voluntary, of course, this 
means that if you want any major 
distributor to pick your film up, it 
has to be rated by the MPAA, and 
if you want any major theater 
chain to play your movie, it has 
to be rated by the MPAA, and if 
you want anyone under the age 
of 18 to see your movie at all at 
almost any theater in America, it 
has to be rated by the MPAA. But, 
of course, you dont have to get it 
rated if you dont want to.
Like Communism and campus 
bikes, the MPAAs rating system 
sounds good in theory. Making it 
harder for children to be exposed 
to excessive violence and other 
influences deemed morally cor
rupt by our society sounds like it 
could only have positive effects. 
Unfortunately, the rating system 
as it stands today hardly does the 
job it claims to do, and does the
jobs it doesnt want to admit to 
very well.
How does one quantify the 
violence in a movie? How many 
times can someone say shit on 
the big screen before it starts 
to adversely affect a 13-year-old 
child? The MPAAs answer is to not 
have a definite answer: Instead 
they have a secret board of rat
ers who decide what Americas 
youths need and doesnt need. 
There are hardly any concrete 
rules for justifying the rating a 
movie receives, and when rules 
are put into words, they just 
sound ridiculous: Frontal nudity 
for a woman is okay as long as 
no pubic hair is seen, and the 
F word can be used once in a 
PG-13 movie as long as its not 
referring to the action of sexual 
intercourse.
The MPAA handpicks the 
people for its ratings board, and 
injects itself into society as a nec
essary entity so that it can retain 
power. No one else has any say in 
what the MPAA does. Not even 
the people it is supposedly pro
tecting.
Over the last few years there 
have been many legal battles 
between the MPAA and the rest 
of the U.S., mostly over copyright 
issues. But recently the MPAA 
did something that really caught 
my attention. After Dark Films, a 
partner of Lionsgate films, recent
ly put up controversial billboards
in Los Angeles and New York City 
that showed graphic scenes from 
its upcoming torture-themed 
movie Captivity. Graphic, in this 
case, means close-up pictures of 
Elisha Cuthberts frightened face 
meant to market the movie as a 
terrifying horror flick. Usually 
theres nothing wrong with put
ting up advertisements that 
will negatively impact youth in 
a city  there are alcohol ads, 
gambling ads, and countless ads 
featuring distorted, perfect 
female bodies sexed up to the 
point of demeaning running ram
pant through every major city. 
This ad for the movie Captivity, 
however, had not been approved 
by the MPAA. The line had been 
crossed.
The MPAA has now suspended 
its rating of the movie until May
1, and even after that the movie 
will be given no priority sched
uling, according to an MPAA 
press release. Furthermore, they 
have required that every single 
piece of Captivitys advertising go 
through the MPAA for each spe
cific advertisement, location. The 
film was originally scheduled for 
release on May 18, but After Dark 
Films may have to delay it while 
they wait for the MPAA. Without 
an R rating (instead receiving an 
NC-17) and with Hostel II (a simi
lar torture-themed movie) being 
released on June 8, Captivity has 
little chance of success. Its only
option at this point is to apolo
gize profusely to the MPAA and 
agree to all of its demands. Then 
the producers might at least 
make their money back. And this 
in a day when Wild Hogs can be 
top at the box office.
I would rather not have cen
sorship at all. The world is an 
utterly disgusting place, with its 
human inhabitants equally as 
disgusting. It is the job of those 
who raise the pure and innocent 
to protect and adjust them to 
the harsh realities they face. But 
if censorship is deemed neces
sary in certain cases, like not 
allowing a billboard with sug
gestive, disturbing images to be 
placed in NYC where schoolchil
dren might see it, I can accept 
that. What I cannot accept is that 
this censorship is unregulated, 
run by a monopolistic group of 
.multi-billion-dollar corpora
tions whose agendas are decided 
politically and monetarily, with 
no regard to who they claim to 
protect  parents and their chil
dren. The MPAA goes beyond 
Orwellian. It isnt even the gov
ernment thats censoring artists. 
This is a trade association, more 
powerful than the government, 
imposing and enforcing its own 
rules on an entire society.

There are often battles between 
government agencies and free 
speech advocates over what 
should be allowed and what is 
punishable bylaw. You can swear 
all you want, but if it creates a 
public disturbance then you can 
get reprimanded for it. And yes, 
it is illegal to yell FIRE! in a 
crowded movie theater.
Movie theaters, however, have 
hundreds of other more subtle 
regulations that are neither welldefined nor transparent to the 
public. Whats worse, these rules 
are not checked by any sort of 
governmental agency  they are 
not created by the government 
at all, and while they are not 
legally enforceable, they have 
been adopted and enforced by 
the movie theaters themselves.

Whos hot and whos not in sports
Mapping the highs and lows of this seasons teams and players
Doug Fricker
Anybody remember when it was 80 
last Tuesday here in Pittsburgh? How 
about last Thursday when we saw a 
high temperature of 32? This substan
tial plunge in temperature compares in 
magnitude only to the collapse of the 
1964 Philadelphia Phillies or Jean Van 
de Velde at the 1999 British Open. Last 
Tuesday was hot like the Florida Gators 
athletics programs, while Thursdays 
cold weather resembled the current play 
of the Milwaukee Bucks  cooler than 
the other side of the pillow.
The Gators not only took home the 
college football championship in Janu
ary, but followed that up with the college 
basketball title a week ago, becoming the 
first school to hold both championships 
at the same time. Milwaukee Bucks fans 
cant quite share in this happiness, with 
the Buck(s) stopping here, losing nine of 
their last 10, positioning themselves with 
the Boston Celtics and Memphis Grizzlies 
in the Greg Oden sweepstakes.
Sticking in the NBA, the Dallas Maver
icks have been hotter than the Spice Girls
in their prime, and will lock up home 
court advantage throughout the playoffs 
any day now. The Washington Wizards 
arent hot, having lost superstar Gilbert 
Arenas for two or three months with 
a knee injury and forward Caron But
ler for six weeks with a fractured hand. 
Theyll limp into the NBA playoffs with 
a probable matchup against the Atlantic 
Division-leading Toronto Raptors.
Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim is eating pitchers alive 
in the first week of the major league base
ball season. Through six games Guerrero 
is hitting .524 (11-21) with three home 
runs and 10 runs batted in. Alex Rodri
guez is hotter than the girl next door, 
with his walk-off grand slam on Satur
day putting him on Yankee fans good 
side for once. Micah Owings is scorch
ing, winning his major league pitching 
debut on Friday by pitching five shutout 
innings as the Arizona Diamondbacks 
defeated the Washington Nationals. Dat
ing back to last year, hes now won 13 
straight decisions.
Former major league pitcher Ugueth 
Urbina was sentenced to 14 years in 
prison in Venezuela (not hot) for the
attempted murder of five workers on his 
familys ranch. Make sure not to draft 
him in your fantasy leagues; it doesnt 
look like hell be pitching any time soon. 
Xavier Nady of the Pittsburgh Pirates had 
a moment hed like to forget in Saturdays 
game against the Cincinnati Reds. The 
Reds Adam Dunn hit a blast to deep right 
center field and as Nady went to jump up 
about a foot from the wall to make the 
catch, the ball landed in his glove and 
then bounced out and over the fence for 
a home run. After the game Dunn said, 
I owe him some beers. It doesnt happen 
every day.
In college hockey, one of the hot
test teams in the nation won the Frozen 
Four Final on Saturday. The Michigan 
State Spartans came into the final as the 
underdog against the Boston College 
Golden Eagles. The Spartans, down 1-0 
most of the game, scored to tie the game 
with 10 minutes left and then netted the 
game-winning goal with only 19 seconds 
remaining to stun BC. It was a tough way 
for BC to end their season, having lost in 
the Frozen Four Final last season.
Thursdays cold weather was like the 
NHLs Colorado Avalanche this season,
missing the playoffs for the first time 
since 1994. Tuesdays warm temperature 
was more like the Buffalo Sabres, the 
team with the best record in the NHL. 
It was like former Georgia Tech wide 
receiver Calvin Johnson and his perfor
mance (4.33 in the 40 yard dash) in the 
NFL pre-draft workouts. Thursday was 
like former USC wide receiver Dwayne 
Jarrett whose draft stock fell as he lacked 
quickness and explosion in addition to 
his unimpressive route running.
Radio host Don Imus is colder than ice, 
with his inappropriate comments about 
the Rutgers womens basketball team. 
Nobiz like Shobiz is hotter than an ant 
under a microscope in Mississippi in July. 
The horse regained its reputation as a le
gitimate Kentucky Derby candidate with 
its performance this past weekend.
Never did I imagine Id include Nobiz 
like Shobiz and the 1964 Philadelphia 
Phillies in the same article. With it snow
ing on Easter and warm on Christmas 
Day, the weather shows that therell 
always be things you cant explain. Un
til then, well just have to grit our teeth 
and put up with weather thats as cold as 
Oksana Baiul.

Carnegie Mellon track and field hosts Geneva and Allegheny colleges
by Sam Kim
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon track 
and field teams returned home 
to host Geneva College and Al
legheny College last Tuesday. On 
a beautiful afternoon, the mens 
team easily defeated Geneva 
138 points to 59, and Allegheny 
108 to 81. Although the womens 
team put up a strong fight, they 
narrowly lost to Allegheny 76 to 
94, but rebounded to beat Ge
neva 116.5 to 68.5.
For the mens team, senior Eric 
Tang won the 100-meter dash 
with a time of 11.43. Fellow se
nior Russel Verbofsky (22.64) 
took first place in the 200-meter 
dash, while junior Kiley Williams 
placed first in the 400-meter dash 
with a time of 51.21. Sophomore 
Carlton Reeves (52.06) finished 
behind Williams in second place.
Sophomore Brian Harvey won 
the 1500-meter run with a time 
of 3:53.57. Behind Harvey, senior 
Davey Quinn finished second 
with a time of 3:55.20. In the 
3000-meter steeplechase, junior 
Jason Jura placed third with a 
time of 10:17.00.
Sophomore Craig Hahn and 
senior Jeff Polack controlled the 
400-meter hurdles. Hahn (57.78) 
won the event and Polack (58.74) 
finished in second place. Junior 
Scott Fortune (1:59.99) and 
first-year Dan Burrows (2:01.55) 
finished second and third, re
spectively, in the 800-meter run.
In the high jump, sophomore 
Colin Marks led the team with a 
jump of 1.75 meters. First-year
Chris Bridgeman won the pole 
vault with a vault of 3.95 meters, 
while Tang jumped 6.37 meters 
to place third in the long jump.
First-year James Hulley took 
second in both the shot put 
(13.87 meters) and discus throw 
(42.74 meters). Junior Mike Reg
gie (48.12 meters) and senior 
Rory Kaclik (36.74 meters) took 
first and third, respectively, in 
the hammer throw. Junior Chris 
Uhrinek won the javelin throw 
with a throw of 48 meters. The 
mens 4xl00-meter (43.60) and 
4x400-meter (3:25.30) relay A 
teams easily handled the com
petition, finishing first in both 
events.
On the womens side, sopho
more Carolyn Clayton (4:58.44) 
won the 1500-meter run, while 
junior Ashley Bakelmun con
tinued to have success in the 
800-meter run, finishing first 
with a time of 2:26.45.
It was great to have a home 
meet in such great weather, 
Clayton said. We had a great 
fan turnout. It was really helpful 
to have our friends out cheering 
for us, especially since we hardly 
ever have home meets. It really 
motivated me and I ran one of my 
best races at CMU thus far.
First-year Timi Abimbola 
(13.71) placed second in the 100- 
meter dash, while sophomore 
Jackie Andreozzi (27.94) took 
second in the 200-meter dash. 
First-year Diane Mattingly placed 
fourth in the 400-meter hurdles 
with a time of 1:11.71.
Timi and Diane have both 
been solid additions to the girls 
team as freshmen, Andreozzi
Sophomore Carolyn Clayton (#610) runs with the lead pack during Tuesday's track meet at Carnegie Mellon. Clayton went on to win the 1500-meter race 
with a time of 4:58.44.
said. Timi brings personality 
to the team and Diane brings a 
strong work ethic.
Sophomore Jess Meng once 
again won the high jump with a 
jump of 1.55 meters. Meng also 
placed second in the triple jump 
(10.59 meters) and third in the 
long jump (4.81 meters). Behind 
Meng, sophomore Sami Simmons 
took third in the triple jump with 
a jump of 10.51 meters. In the 
pole vault, senior Heidi Grothaus 
(2.75 meters) and first-year Anna
Lenhart (2.60 meters) finished 
second and third, respectively.
Senior Becky Metier took 
second in the hammer throw 
(42.88 meters) and third in the 
shot put (11.40 meters), while 
fellow senior Lizza McGregor fin
ished third in the hammer throw 
(30.82 meters) and the discus 
throw (34.42 meters).
Although the Tartan womens 
4x400-meter relay A team took a 
sizable lead in the first few laps, 
they lost a close race to the Ge
neva team and finished second 
with a time of 4:14.25. The Tar
tans also fell to Geneva in the 
4xl00-meter relay, finishing sec
ond with a time of 52.98.
Unlike some of the other 
meets, students who normally 
would not qualify for a major 
meet had the opportunity to par
ticipate in Tuesdays dual meet. I 
think the coaches do a good job 
[enforcing] a policy where you 
are guaranteed a fair number of 
meets despite your skill, firstyear Ronell Auld said. I think 
this enforces the idea that every
one is equal on the team and it is 
more about your work ethic than 
your talent level.
Carnegie Mellons track teams 
will host a tri-meet against Seton 
Hill University, the University 
of Pittsburgh-Johnstown, and 
Waynesburg College on Tuesday, 
before traveling to Robert Mor
ris University to compete at the 
Bennie Benson Invitational on 
Saturday.

The Carnegie Mellon mens golf 
team began the spring portion 
of its season this past weekend 
by winning the Westminster 
Invitational. Tartan sophomore 
Alex Timmons won the individ
ual portion of the tournament. 
Last week, the Tartan sat down 
with Timmons to discuss the 
tournament and the golf season.
Tartan: When did you start 
golfing?
Timmons: I started playing 
in about fifth grade, at a club 
and individual tournaments, and 
then I played in high school too.
Tartan: Was golf part of your 
decision to come to Carnegie 
Mellon?
T: Yes. It was definitely a big 
part of my decision to come 
here. I came on a recruiting trip,
I didnt stay overnight or any
thing, but I met some of the 
players, and went to a couple 
of classes, and really liked the 
school. I knew I really wanted to 
play in college and was excited 
that I could play here.
Tartan: How do you handle 
the academic load at Carnegie 
Mellon and athletics?
T: I actually do better
academically during the golf 
season, when I know I have very 
limited time, and have to get my 
work done. I pretty much just sit 
down and do it instead of pro
crastinating like I can do in the 
off-season.
Tartan: Do you play just for
individual scores or team scores 
as well?
T: How it works is [that] for 
every tournament we can send 
at least one team of five play
ers, and they tally the top four 
scores as your team score, and 
the scores count for individual 
players too. Most tournaments, 
were only allowed one team, 
sometimes we can take two, and 
there are usually ten to twelve 
teams at the tournament.
Tartan: Do you have any ritu
als or superstitions for during a 
tournament?
T: Golf is such a mental sport; 
its really all about confidence, 
so some people really go out of 
their way with things like that. 
Personally, Ill only use golf balls 
with the numbers four or one on 
them, and then I mark them with 
a silver Sharpie.
Tartan: Are there any ac
complishments that you are 
particularly proud of?
Ti^Well this weekend was the 
first college tournament that Ive 
won so Im proud of that, and I 
think being on the team in itself 
is an accomplishment.d
Tartan: Do you have a most 
memorable shot or tournament?
T: I have a couple memorable 
shots from the tournament last 
weekend, but thats probably just 
because it was only a few days 
ago. Our conference tournament 
last year was pretty memorable 
for me; I didnt play very well, 
but our captain played really 
well, and ended up in a playoff 
and won the tournament, so it 
was really exciting.
Tartan: Do you have a favor
ite place that youve visited for 
golf?
T: Arizona is really nice for 
golf. The weather is really 
nice, and they have lots of nice 
courses. With the team, the only 
place weve traveled to a lot is 
Florida. We went to Florida for 
spring break, and were holding 
our conference tournament this 
year, in Florida, so thatll be fun.
Tartan: Do you have any per
sonal or team goals in mind?
T: Winning another tourna
ment is a good personal goal, 
and then I would really like for 
us to qualify for NCAAs this year 
as a team.

Pittsburgh tea party
From 61C to Kiva Flan
There's nothing like a good cup of tea to warm you on 
a cold morning, to soothe a sore throat, to 
energize you for a long day of class, or to accompany 
a good book and maybe a cookie or two. Whether you 
like your tea hot, harsh, and caffeinated or delicate, 
herbal, and laced with honey, youll find a good cup at 
these Pittsburgh cafs.
T Caf, Murray Avenue, Squirrel Hill
No one in Pittsburgh takes tea more seriously than T 
Caf. In the winter, the shop fogs up like the inside of 
a teakettle. T Caf serves over 100 kinds of tea. When 
you order, your selection comes on a tray, served 
loose-leaf in its own teapot and accompanied by a 
tea timer. Complete with three different hourglass 
chambers, a tea timer allows you to brew a perfect 
cup of weak, medium, or strong tea  you'U only see 
'them in the really serious tea shops. I particularly 
enjoyed the rose tea, but you cant get a bad cup 
of tea at T Caf. All the teas that the caf serves 
are also available to take home. With free wireless, 
a quirky assortment of chairs and tables, and the 
occasional musical act or poetry reading, T Caf is 
by far Pittsburghs best spot for tea.
61C Caf, Murray Avenue, Squirrel Hill
Just up the street from T Caf, 61C Caf is named 
for the bus that stops just outside. The caf serves 
41 kinds of tea, everything from simple black teas to 
obscure flavored blends. The tea comes loose-leaf in a 
nice teapot, but the caf doesn't provide anything to 
put the infuser on, which either leads to overstewed 
tea or a soggy table. With so many choices, you 
can order a different kind of tea each time you visit 
the caf and never be disappointed. The cafs free 
wireless and overpriced but delicious pastries attract 
everyone in Pittsburgh with a laptop, and during peak 
hours it can be hard to find a table (and impossible to 
find an outlet). A cash-only policy is a bit discouraging 
for those who prefer plastic, but 61C Caf is still a 
great place for a relaxing, homework-accompanying 
pot of tea.
Quiet Storm, Penn Avenue, Garfield
Although Quiet Storm offers a comparatively piddling 
16 teas, each is served loose-leaf in a generous 
Chinese restaurant-style teapot with a strainer and 
a honey pot. The lounge in the back features several 
old-fashioned arcade games and a rack of magazines. 
A combination coffeehouse and restaurant, Quiet 
Storm offers excellent hippie-watching, which is a 
nice change from the Starbucks crowd. Last weekend, 
a mother and daughter came in with matching hot 
pink hair. Quiet Storm is definitely a worthy spot for 
tea and conversation  though its probably wise to 
avoid Penn Avenue at night.
Kiva Han, South Craig Street, Oakland
Although this coffee joint only offers tea in bags, 
theyre organic and tasty (the Earl Grey with 
lavender is particularly good) and served in colorful
Everything you need to know
About ditching the bar, and getting the giri
mismatched mugs. What Kiva Han lacks in customer 
service it makes up for with lots of seating, wacky 
art, and huge people-watching windows, perfect for 
laughing at the fools going to Starbucks across the 
street.
Briefly Noted:
Coffee Tree Roasters: Although the tea is served 
in teapots  a plus  the tea is bagged (the shame!) 
with only a few worthwhile flavors. The Walnut Street 
shop is worth visiting for the yuppie-watching, but 
not particularly for the tea.
Starbucks, Borders, and Barnes & Noble: All
serve dull Tazo teas. Boring! At least Borders offers 
loose-leaf Tazo.
Margarets Fine Imports: No tea fan can live in . 
Pittsburgh without visiting this Forbes Avenue shop. 
Margaret's Fine Imports offers a wall of loose-leaf teas 
and shelves of bagged teas from several countries, 
plus teapots of all sizes, shapes, and colors. Margaret 
even holds a tea class at the beginning of every 
month.

Squirrel Hills 61C Caf and T Caf are two local 
options to satisfy all your tea-drinking needs.
Dear Janet,
i dont really have people on the 
weekends to go out with ... a lot 
of the people I hang out with 
during the week are busy on 
weekend nights. So weekends 
kind of suck. I want to pick up 
some girls but I dont really feel 
like drinking and I dont know 
where else to go. Im really not 
good at picking up women. Im 
really fcad at that pivotal step, 
you know, the one where you 
make a move.
A Lame Openings Never 
Enough
Dear ALONE,
See, heres where I think you're 
making your biggest mistake: I 
dont know that many people go out 
to bars for the express purpose of 
being picked up. Oh, it might happen 
as a random byproduct, but people 
dont tend to venture singly to bars. 
They go in groups, which makes 
finding people who are single and 
available quite difficult, especially for 
people in your situation, without a 
dedicated group of friends to go out 
with on the weekend.
Why do you keep going to bars? 
Find a hobby! The best place to 
meet girls is the places you already 
go, or doing the things that you 
already enjoy. Meeting someone is 
less about making a move" and
more about starting a conversation. 
Just start talking about something; 
be friendly. Even if youre just at 
the grocery store, getting the 
conversation started is about 60 
percent of the battle (another 30 
percent is getting her number, and 
the remaining 10 percent is not 
embarrassing yourself during the 
actual conversation). Once you're 
talking, stay alert to any relationship 
status clues and whether she seems 
to be digging you or not. Then go for 
it!
Heres my rationale when it comes 
to situations like this. Generally, you 
can tell at least if someone finds 
you somewhat interesting and/ 
or attractive. If you genuinely feel 
theres a connection and you'd like 
to see them again, what do you have 
to lose? As long as its not someone 
you work with, the absolute worst 
thing that could happen is you ask 
for her number and she says no. 
However, the best case is that youll 
fail in love, have lots of hot crazy sex, 
get married, and live happily ever 
after, which is nothing to sneeze at. 
So hop to it, OK? Youve got to date 
a few that arent perfect before you 
find one that is.

On the hunt with Deerhunter
Underground rock band plays at...The Underground
Arranged urbanely around a large gray van, each bearing 
a cool, devil-may-care gaze, three of the five members of 
Atlantas Deerhunter loiter, hours before their show, behind 
The Underground  an appropriately named venue for a band 
that started out playing raucous Atlanta-area house parties 
and hole-in-the-wall joints packed with sweaty hipsters. 
Bassist Josh Fauver  the most vocal of the band members
 was starting to get restless. Of life on the road, Fauver 
says, "I hate it. Its boring."
Despite the temporary ennui, this has been an eventful 
year for Deerhunter. Before playing at Austins megafestival 
South by Southwest, the band recorded its latest album 
Cryptograms in Commerce, Ga., a podunk town outside music 
mecca, Athens. Deerhunter also has a new EP scheduled for 
release on April 16, and if its new album and 2005's turn it up 
faggot are any indicator of the band's progress, the upcoming 
EP should be another delightfully dark and noisily intriguing 
journey into the murky depths of post-punk psychedelia.
If you went to grab an order of provolone sticks at The 
Underground on Tuesday, you might have noticed something 
different about this campus food destination; if four quirky 
looking guys with plaid shirts and scruffy beards playing 
instruments wasnt weird enough for you, then a 6'5" 
singer weighing no more than 80 pounds clad in a womans 
dress was probably the clincher. This is what Deerhunter 
brings in style; in the words of singer Bradford Cox: "white 
trash." Musically, Deerhunters perspective is much more . 
sophisticated; their sound is blissful and chaotic at the same 
time. Its trippy, yet totally danceable.
Playing in a venue clearly smaller than what they were used 
to, the band members were cramped onstage as they blasted 
their way through jams heavy in texture and energy. Drummer 
Moses Archuleta never lost his youthful spirit as he pounded 
out beats that had a hint of Ringo on The Beatles's Tomorrow 
Never Knows," and  alongside Fauver  Archuleta made 
for a rhythm section powerful enough to make the puny walls 
of The Underground wobble. The guitar work of Locket Pundt 
and Mee was always tight, always interesting; even when 
the band veered off into a trippy jam toward DJ Shadow-land, 
both guitarists were in sync, as if they had the whole thing - 
planned out. But in the end, it was Cox's vocal work that set 
the band apart from its often whiney and obnoxious peers. 
Cox', whose microphone was jacked with reverb and looping 
effects, created sheets of sound with his voice (no sign of 
vocal melodies anywhere). The energy of the show climaxed 
when Cox jumped on tables chanting and pushing the band 
at the same time.
It is this tightness that has earned the band recent critical 
acclaim. Archuleta books Deerhunter's shows, and by making 
friends with other bands they have scored gigs with such 
notables as Liars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Ex-Models, and Lightning 
Bolt. Evidently being sociable has paid off, and not just with 
other musicians; Fans like you! says a friend accompanying 
the guys on the tour.
And with good reason. In addition to being friendly, 
Deerhunter offers a fresh mixture of electronic and 
underground-rock music, and has a, well, interesting style 
that nobody has seen since the filthy beauty of Janis Joplin.
But with the band's growing popularity, who knows where it 
will be stylistically in the coming years. According to Fauver, 
the members of Deerhunter plan to record an album in their 
tour van. Avant garde? Maybe. Ambitious? Certainly.

When conductors compose
PSO performs Salonens Foreign Bodiesl'!'tMIPaPerhouse
" On Justin Timberlake
This weekend, Michael Christie will conduct the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) in Esa-Pekka 
Salonen's 2001 orchestral work Foreign Bodies." 
Salonen, better known as a conductor, has been the 
head of the Los Angeles Philharmonic since 1992. When 
the PSO plays Foreign Bodies, however, there will be 
no need for Salonen to have a baton handy.
In the world of classical music, I've noticed that pianists 
always want to conduct (Daniel Barenboim in Chicago, 
Christoph Eschenbach in Philadelphia, and Vladimir 
Ashkenazy being the most notable), conductors always 
want to compose (Salonen and Wilhelm Furtwngler), 
and composers always want to conduct  at least, their 
own music.
Salonen and these other artists have all been fairly 
successful  although they all seem to be a little 
streaky in the consistencies of their interpretations  in 
whichever path they have chosen, and are generally 
able to continue working as pianist/conductors and 
conductor/composers.
However, some, like Furtwngler (who died in 1954), are 
known exclusively as conductors, though Furtwngler's 
most ardent wish was to be etched in posterity as a 
composer. Furtwngler only conducted in order to make 
a living. Salonen is a similar case: He told the London 
Telegraph in 2005 that I only conducted to  what is it 
you English say?  keep the wolf from the door. Also, I 
wanted to hear my music conducted by someone who 
was really keen on it! But then my Philharmonia concert 
went well, I got asked to do more things, and  I don't 
know, things took off."
Salonen, born in 1958, studied composition during his 
years at the Sibelius Academy of Finland. Conducting 
has monopolized Salonen's time, so much so that in 
2000, he took a sabbatical to compose. Salonen is 
already an accomplished conductor, but whether or 
not he can make that transition to become a successful 
composer is a different story.
Salonens conducting experience translates into 
music that is skillfully orchestrated. As a conductor,
Head of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, Es-Pekka Salnon is a 
conductor-turned-composer. This 
weekend, the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra will perform Salonens 
Foreign Bodies.
Salonen has learned all of the tricks for scoring music. 
Salonen has forgotten more about scoring than most 
film composers ever learn, no matter how many 
two-and-a-half-hour sequels they get to write music 
for. Foreign Bodies is worth hearing if only for the 
lavish and skillful orchestration. In "Bodies, you've got 
everything you could imagine  huge wind, brass, 
and string sections, and an enormous complement of 
percussion (including some unusual instruments, whose 
interesting effects I won't spoil). Salonen recorded the 
work with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, 
which was released by Deutsche Grammophon in 
February 2005.
But thats the problem with Foreign Bodies: Its main 
virtue is its lavish orchestration. Sure, in carefully 
listening to Salonens recording of the piece, I detected 
some musical arguments and motives, but they just 
weren't that interesting. After listening to the piece 
several times, its charm wore off. Perhaps I was blinded 
by the pieces accessibility, which deceived me into 
thinking it was superficial.
From "Foreign Bodies," it is obvious that Salonen is a 
skilled orchestrator, which comes from his conducting. 
But as for actual composition, when all the orchestral 
effects are out of the way, I am still on the fence as to 
Salonen's status as a composer. Salonen has the clout as 
a conductor and is making the time to write new works 
and record them. But once Salonen is no longer around, 
will anyone play his music?
Even if Foreign Bodies doesnt make a profound 
impression on you, it is definitely worth hearing this 
week at the symphony. The virtuosic PSO promises 
to deliver a knockout performance of this orchestral 
showpiece.

Monday, March 19, Justin Timberlake performed to a near-capacity 
crowd at the Mellon Arena in downtown Pittsburgh. His act featured 
an array of dancers and four runway-type structures along which 
Justin strutted during his act. The seats that lined these bars, which 
reportedly sold for upwards of $500 a pop, were regarded as the 
best in the house. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that Timberlake 
f performed as a superstar, and the production racked up style 
points.
A few days later, on March 22, Field Music and Land of Talk 
opened for Menomena at Lawrenceville Moose on 52nd street in 
Lawrenceville. Amidst a crowd of hipsters and undergraduates 
looking forward to the headliner, Reid Music might have felt a smidge 
underappreciated (this author missed Land of Talks performance), 
but in fact they simply fell victim to the infamous Pittsburgh 
audience, whereby the crowds reaction, even to precise, virtuosic 
performances of solidly intoxicating pop or what have you, is a bit of 
polite applause along with the continuation of ongoing conversations. 
Its not that we don't appreciate the music  because we do, really
 we just dont feel obligated to show it.
Justin Timberlakes performance, by my rough and by no means 
authoritative estimates, could have raked in close to $1 million in 
ticket sales. Admittedly, this might not have paid off all the dancers 
and event staff, but simply as a matter of scope it is impressive, 
compared to a few hundred folks in a dimly lit moose lodge 
auditorium decorated with strings of  70s aluminized confetti.
Some time after the Timberlake performance, one of the staff 
members at WRCT, who was in attendance during an executive 
meeting, suggested that we add Timberlakes newest album, 
FutureSex/LoveSounds, into our regular rotation. This sparked what 
could be called a spirited debate as to the relative artistic quality 
(some asserted the term was being loosely applied) of Timberlake 
and, say, Electric Wizard, which I was not qualified to evaluate 
critically. I am not too familiar with either artist, though in the interests 
of disclosure I must admit a measure of considered displeasure at 
the notion of Timberlakes sensational stadium-raising. But I do hope 
to say with some measure of authority that Timberlakes album shall 
never be shown the light of our record library, except possibly in the 
future, in the. interests of archival. He doesnt need our exposure.

David Sedaris
New Yorker essayist visits
Carnegie Music Hall was packed last Monday night  a few 
bodies short of maximum capacity, the crowd neared 2000. _ 
Tickets for the event were selling on cxaigslist.orgfor upwards 
of $50, more than double the $20 box office price. It's rare for 
the Drue Heinz Lecture Series to fill an entire venue, as Scott 
Hamley, director of WDUQ 90.5 FM, mentioned before the 
podium. It takes a lot for a single lecturer to fill a music hall, 
and David Sedaris was just the person to do it.
Sedaris is perhaps the most accessible of the writers who 
have spoken as part of the lecture series. A pop culture 
icon in the world of words, his humor and straightforward 
writing style attract fans both literary and not. Though he 
has authored a number of best-sellers, including Dress Your 
Family in Corduroy and Denim, Naked, and Me Talk Pretty 
One Day, it was evident on Monday night that Sedaris is as 
much a performer as he is a writer.
Sedaris's introduction gave everyone a chance to adjust to 
his perhaps unexpected voice: Though he's a consistent 
contributor to NPR and has sold recordings of his readings, 
his distinct, slightly high-pitched voice still punctures 
the eardrums a bit more than anticipated. Once he gets 
going, though, his voice is an obvious fit to his personality, 
which comes through with clarity in both his writing and 
speaking. Sedaris spoke of truths" in his writing, a popular 
topic for many literary journalists and creative nonfiction 
writers. Satirically,-he confessed to the audience of some of 
his published inaccuracies {the color of a station wagon in 
one story; an incorrect quote in a line of dialogue). Sedaris 
provoked a steady stream of laughter until, in classic Sedaris 
style, he pushed his humor to its limit, evoking both nods and 
groans of disgust with his vivid description of a disconnected 
uteruss "blood bubbles" and "little hairs.
Following this introduction, Sedaris read two stories, 
beginning with the sentimental "The Heart is a Lonely 
Menagerie. In the narrative, Sedaris poked fun at his own 
youthful affinity for all things antique, however gaudy. From 
this premise, the audience followed Sedaris into a wacky 
boarding house in Chapel Hill, N.C., which he chose for its 
'30s decor. Sedariss timing was impeccable, including even 
his water breaks, which doubled as cues for the audience to 
pause and laugh.
His next story was All the Beauty You Will Ever Need, 
an essay recently published in The New Yorker, which he 
claimed to be reading for the first time. In the story, Sedaris 
visited a trailer park with his brother to buy marijuana. The 
key to his writing is how he understands the comedy of 
standard conversations: In recalling a dialogue with the drug 
dealer's wife, Sedaris touched on the misguided fascination 
many heterosexuals have with the sex lives of homosexuals 
(Which one of you is the woman? the wife asks).
Sedaris ended with book recommendations. His pick of the 
evening was Max Brookss The Zombie Survival Guide, a 
book he said is hilarious because it doesn't try to be. While 
answering questions from the audience, Sedaris sometimes 
fumbled his replies, struggling to be witty on the spot. The 
words would have come easier, Sedaris explained, if he hadn't 
quit smoking in January. I didnt quit for health reasons.... I 
think that's a myth, he joked. Rather, Sedaris claimed it was 
the Ritz-Carltons ban on cigarettes that finally got him to quit. 
The audience chuckled in amusement. With David Sedaris, 
even tobacco is something worth laughing about.

This movie was the first Indiana

This weeks International Film 
Festival movie is from Japan. 
Iden&Tity is the story of a 
Japanese rock band discovering 
the meaning of rock music and 
nonconformity, and finding the 
balance between their own 
identities and the bands identity 
as a whole. Obvious jokes 
about Japanese learning about 
nonconformity aside, this should 
be a great change of pace for 
moviegoers on campus, and 
a great twist on the rock band 
movie. Also, many of the actors 
in the movie are actual musicians 
(even the director used to be in a 
punk rock band), and the scenes 
of the band playing at concerts 
are supposed to be great.

Forrest Whitaker won a ton of 
awards, including a Golden 
Globe and an Oscar, for his 
performance in this movie as 
Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. A 
quick history lesson: Amin seized 
power violently in 1971 and 
was known for being eccentric 
(bordering on clinically paranoid)
 his regime killed several 
hundred thousand people in the 
eight years he was in power.
The movie is based on a book 
of the same name and shows 
Amin through the eyes of his 
physician. The title is a reference 
to one of the many absurd and 
grandiose titles Amin bestowed 
upon himself as his sanity waned. 
It should be a good time, and 
a great look at a dictator that 
time has already come close to 
forgetting.
Pans Labyrinth
Saturday, April 14

Youve probably heard about this 
one already. Directed by Guillermo 
del Toro, its a story about a young 
girl during the Spanish Civil War 
who escapes into a fantasy land 
with hopes of saving the life of her 
unborn baby brother. The movie 
is far darker than a tiny synopsis 
like this can convey; the creature 
design is unsettlingly alien, and the 
girls stepfather (an officer in the 
Spanish army) demonstrates very 
little restraint when dealing with 
captured rebels. The narrative leaves 
some holes open for you to fill in for 
yourself, but this isnt necessarily a 
bad thing  it gives you plenty to 
talk about with your friends after you 
leave the theater. And you will want 
to talk.
Monty Python and the

A recommendation: Do not go 
see this movie alone. Go with your 
friends, because its guaranteed 
that everyone else will be in the 
theater with friends, reciting every 
single line and laughing hysterically 
afterwards. Youre going to need 
your own friends with you so you 
can make snide remarks about your 
fellow moviegoers! Thats not nice, 
of course, but you should know 
what youre getting into. Monty 
Python and the Holy Grail is one 
of those movies everyone at this 
school has seen approximately
17 times, and, sure, its funny as 
hell (Who can say no to the Black 
Knight, who keeps spouting insults 
and challenges even after all his 
limbs are gone?), but if youve 
seen it once, or even twice, youve 
probably seen it enough times to 
skip out this Sunday.

Pittsburgh is home to art studios, galleries, independent museums, music venues, 
and a grassroots culture that is rapidly expanding and attracting out-of-towners to 
the city  and most people dont even know it. In every neighborhood of Pittsburgh, 
movers and shakers are creating new works and contributing to the art community that 
pervades the citys cultural underground. Yet, without a forum to discover artists new 
projects, many visitors and residents alike tend to overlook Pittsburghs various forms of 
artistic representation.
Nathan Martin and Carl DiSalvo of the art group Carbon Defense League and 
DeepLocal.com are working to solve this problem. The pair collaborated with friends 
at the Andy Warhol Museum on the Mapping Pittsburgh project, which produced an 
interactive map website called Altwarhol [altwaihol.maphub.org). The site allows users 
to add hotspots, photographs, and videos, as well as make comments and suggestions 
about places on the map. In celebration of Mapping Pittsburghs-site launch, the Warhol 
Museum held an event Friday evening complete with DJs, a feminist punk band, 
clothing reconstruction, sticker-making, and local art exhibits.
With the hope of better enabling community members to collect and share information 
from their neighborhoods, Martin, a College of Fine Arts alum, and DiSalvo formed 
DeepLocal.com to develop business solutions using information systems technology. 
Were not content creators, were technology providers," Martin specified. Even before 
the invention of Google Maps, he, DiSalvo, and fellow techie Jess Maki were hatching 
plans for an interactive maps website, MapHub.com, a project now three years in the 
making.
Given the popularity of Wikipedia and Urban Dictionary, it may come as no surprise 
that PopCity magazine called MapHub the Wikipedia of maps. In addition to 
developing MapHub, which should benefit all of Pittsburgh, DeepLocal has worked 
with residents of the Homewood area, collecting videotaped oral histories, mapping 
assets, and determining the area's amenities. Using this information, DeepLocal helped 
Homewood to capitalize on resources that had previously gone unnoticed and increase 
the revenue of local businesses.
Though altwaihol.maphub.org is only a few days old, several points of interest have 
already sprung up on the map, including independent movie theater Melwood 
Screening Room (Melwood Avenue, North Oakland) and an alternative gallery space 
called ON (Penn Avenue, Garfield). Martin intends for the site to give a forum for 
artists, musicians, and DJs to publicize their own work and get some exposure. He 
believes that the assets in a city like Pittsburgh are hidden, and so the website will 
reveal the numerous underground activities that, in Martins words, don't happen in 
[just] the Cultural District and in the South Side bars. In addition to benefiting locals, 
the site should influence Pittsburgh visitors; if local artists and other contributors to the 
site add their favorite hip bars, funky art spaces, and quirky music venues to the map, 
it should encourage people to get out and see all that the city has to offer in the way of 
cultural activity.
Warhol Museum Director of Education Leslie Clague did not hesitate to help DeepLocal 
achieve its goal of exposing art in Pittsburgh. Clague, another College of Fine Arts 
alum, advocates using the Warhol's resources to not only showcase and preserve 
Warhols work and link Warhol's legacy with contemporary [work]," but also to unify 
what she called the citys "disconnected grassroots culture."
In addition to employing local artists, the museum contributes to the local art scene by 
holding showcases of local art; Clague is campaigning to organize happenings such as 
Fridays gathering more often. Much like Martin, Clague wants the Altwarhol website 
to be a resource and an archive, especially for those unaware of the arts in Pittsburgh. 
Regarding her experience as a student at Carnegie Mellon, Clague said, The kids 
on campus did not leave campus. They never got out and werent aware of the city. 
Theres this weird Pittsburgh phenomenon [that keeps people from exploring the city]." 
Clague attributes part of the problem to Pittsburghs disconnected topography and the 
separated neighborhoods that make up the city. To counter this effect, Clague said, 
"[Pittsburgh] needs that connectivity to really make things start to happen." Projects 
like Mapping Pittsburgh will hopefully inspire people to take advantage of the clubs, 
bars, restaurants, galleries, and music venues that make Pittsburgh a diverse and 
interesting place to five.
Another point on the map that enhances Pittsburghs art scene is the Cogniscenti 
Art Gallery in Bridgeville, a studio owned and operated by artist Wendy DiNicola.
With the aim of bringing various art forms together, DiNicola added yoga classes 
and aromatherapy to her repertoire and plans on holding drama classes and open 
mic nights in the near future. After working out of her home for nine years, she 
opened her own gallery a year ago. Now, though DiNicola has high expectations for

Last Friday, local artists gathered at the Andy Warhol Museum to celebrate the 
launch of the Mapping Pittsburgh project.

community outreach programs, her primary 
goal is to let "everybody express themselves. 
Acknowledging the difficulty inherent in an 
artist's career, she said, "Its not a glamorous life. 
Theres a lot of sacrifice. We are unique people." 
Even if her gallery may take time to be profitable, 
she asserts, I'm doing my own thing and Im 
happy with it.
Likewise satisfied with her art is DJ Mary 
Mack, a local artist who got her start DJing for 
Carnegie Mellon's radio station WRCT as an 
undergraduate. A performer at Friday nights 
event, Mack organizes themed dance parties 
and gives the proceeds to organizations such as 
the alternative Big Idea Info Shop. Past themes 
have included Flashdance and Hot For Teacher. 
On April 20, Mack will host a railroad-themed 
party in a storefront space at 5020 Penn Avenue 
in Garfield to inform the public about the 1877 
railroad strike. In Mack's words, her parties 
attract primarily "punks, artists, and activists, 
but she wants to cross over into other social 
circles as well. Summarizing her contribution 
to Pittsburghs alternative art scene, she said, 
"We like throwing parties and supporting good 
causes. Mack, who strongly supports Altwarhol, 
said, "Theres been a need for a while for people 
who are doing events to communicate with 
each other. I hope this site will serve as a big 
connector for art, music, and activism. Mack 
said she may add to the map two of her favorite 
hangouts: Lawrenceville dive bar Belvederes 
and North Side coffee shop Beliza. Theres 
a lot of love for Pittsburgh and funny little 
idiosyncratic things about the city," she said.
Manny Theiner, director of Garfield Artworks 
and another Carnegie Mellon alum, also sees the 
need to make art accessible to the public. "My 
favorite phrase is 'frame of reference,  Theiner 
said. If people dont have the ability to relate to 
something, then its hard to explain to them or 
attract them in any way. As director of Garfield 
Artworks, he books local bands, schedules 
touring acts, selects artwork for display in 
the gallery, and works with independent film 
organization Jefferson Presents... to show 
experimental and avant-garde films every month. 
Theiner characterizes Pittsburghs art scene as 
fragmented by neighborhoods and cliques and 
who has the money and who doesnt, but still 
believes that the city booms with activity given 
its size. Having witnessed students failure to 
explore Pittsburgh while at Carnegie Mellon, 
Theiner said that people on this campus [need] 
to leave it to find out whats going on.

Stephen Lynch
Still a little bit specialDance Alloy Theater's Fragile
Pay what you can to see three works by a successful local company
In the spirit of Easter, Pittsburgh is welcoming a musician 
whose parents were formerly a priest and nun. Although 
such an artist may seem like a saint-tumed-entertainer, once 
Stephen Lynch opens his mouth to sing over his melodic 
strumming, it's easy to see the devil within.
Lynch, playing the Byham on Thursday, April 12, brings 
with him a sense of humor that can be considered a little bit 
special.
Friendships with the likes of Jay Mohr and radio hosts Opie 
and Anthony aided Lynch in gaining his foothold on the' 
comedic landscape. With several appearances on Comedy 
Central, Lynch has worked hard since the early days of cutting 
his first album, A Little Bit Special. Four albums later, Lynch's 
career has him touring the country.
So long as your sense of humor has a slight air of comedic 
darkness, Lynch may tickle you in some interesting places.
His music, a guitar-driven singer-songwriter style, is both 
melodic and jovial, without betraying his lyrical excesses.
A fair warning to audience members would be: "If you laugh 
at this material, there is a high chance that you are going to 
hell.
Lynchs music has gotten him in trouble before. In Kill a 
Kitten, Lynch sings If life makes you feel like quittin, itll 
help a lot of you kill a kitten. These lyrics stirred some PETA 
activists, but Lynch resolved the issue by explaining that he 
was not actually promoting violence against kitty cats.
One of the most important things to understand and 
appreciate in Lynch's music is that it is not serious.
Regardless of the political incorrectness or supposed 
offensiveness of Lynch's touchy subjects, he is there to 
entertain, not insult or denigrate. The controversy that 
surrounds his songs (because, yes, they are purposely in 
bad taste) only serves to cement his reputation among the 
Comedy Central crowd of semi-jaded Generation Xand Y-ers.
In "Priest," Lynch touches upon the Catholic Church sexual 
abuse scandals from the viewpoint of a priest tempted by an 
alter boy You will find the grace of God inside my rec ... tory, 
he sings. Still, not all of Lynch's songs pertain to disturbing 
realities. Less serious subjects, such as the erotic effects of 
rodents in the rectum or unintended sexual encounters with 
hermaphrodites, are also included in Lynch's repertoire.
Lynchs music requires a regression to earlier, less mature, 
states of development. We have to allow the id to run free.
But given his popularity and success in the mainstream, this 
seems quite easy for most of us to do.

An important member of Pittsburgh's cultural scene, Dance 
Alloy Theater (DAT) is well known for its flair and style 
in productions of contemporary dance works. Under the 
supervision of Beth Corning, the company's director, the upand-coming presentation of Fragile promises to match DATs 
tradition of excellence.
A three-piece show meant to explore the power of human 
connections through movement, Fragile's choreography is 
the product of three creative minds. Fragile features two 
debuts, Tony Award nominee Donald Birds "No Consolation" 
and Comings "Flight, in addition to a signature piece by 
Susan Marshall, Arms." All three works speak to the theme 
of human interactions, the impact each pass-ing exchange 
or loss leaves on individuals, as well as the human desire for 
contact and intimacy.
Bird created "No Consolation" specifically for DAT. He was 
inspired by a program he watched about a young mans 
death in a bicycling accident and the steps his family took to 
ensure his memory lived on. [Bird] saw this and he was so 
moved by the way they had come together that he created 
this piece," said Lauren Urbschat, the public relations official 
for DAT. Its about all the things there really are no words for, 
like when a young person is taken totally unexpectedly.
First performed in 1984, Marshalls Arms" is a five-minute 
duet depicting a conversation between dancers that is 
almost entirely performed through arms. Fragile will be the 
Pittsburgh premier of this rendition of "Arms.
The final piece is the artistic vision of Corning, and was 
inspired by a poem she read about the migration of birds 
titled Accidents by Norwegian poet Dag T. Stramsvag.
An air ballet, "Flight encapsulates the world of the 
poem through dance, in addition to exploring a sense of 
community. It's about being part of a group versus being 
alone  and how youre always sort of doing both," said 
Urbschat. Corning choreographed the piece for DATs 
company of five dancers.
Founded in 1976, DAT began as a company of eight 
dancers. Four years later, the studio opened its own classes 
for prospective students in the neighboring Pittsburgh 
area. Throughout its history, DATs dance pieces have 
been commissioned by both established and emerging 
choreographers alike, allowing DAT's company to tour both 
nationally and globally. The company performances have 
ranged from seasons in New York City to tours abroad, 
including countries like Hungary and Bulgaria. DATs 30-year 
history has been a successful one, especially given its growth 
in national and international acclaim, and its popularity 
throughout Pittsburgh.
Additionally, DAT offers classes in many different styles of 
dance, including ballet, modern, jazz, and hip-hop. These 
non-competitive programs offer students several diverse 
ways to express themselves through movement. Dancers of 
all levels are welcome and encouraged to visit the studios.
What is particularly interesting about Fragile is its target 
audience: college students. Students will receive $2 
discounts on tickets, and one of the performance nights
 "College Night with European Dessert Intermission  is 
specifically themed to attract local students. Also, the Sunday 
matinee performance is "pay what you can," meaning the 
show has no official ticket price. With the combination of 
discounts and cake, who could refuse a trip this weekend to 
Dance Alloy Theater?
Su Chu | Staffwriter
Fragile is to be performed April 13-16 at the New Hazlett 
Theater in the North Side. Tickets are $20 general admission, 
$15 for students and seniors ($2 discount with reservations 
and ID). The performance is scheduled for 8 p.m. on Friday 
and Saturday, 2 p.m. on Sunday, and 7 p.m. on Monday.

Seinfeld on Sat.
Whats the deal with that?
What would you do if you were offered $5 million to make a 30-minute 
television episode? If you answered Walk away, then you and Jerry 
Seinfeld are thinking on the same level. In 1998, Seinfeld, one of the most 
popular sitcoms in American television history, was so big that NBC 
offered Seinfeld $5 million per episode if he did a 10th season. He turned 
it down and made that year the shows last.
Since then, Seinfeld has remained relatively active on the comedy circuit, 
releasing an immensely popular and side-splittingly funny standup 
album, I'm Telling You For The Last Time. He has also appeared on TV, 
including a cameo on Saturday Night Live when Julia Louis-Dreyfus (who 
played Elaine on Seinfeld) was hosting. Additionally, Seinfeld appeared at 
this years Oscars, presenting the award for Best Documentary.
In 2002, Seinfeld released a childrens book, Halloween. Although the 
book is animated and young in its theme, it still carries Seinfelds 
cynicism and wit, mocking the ridiculousness of Halloween (remember 
when your Mom made you wear a jacket over your Superman costume?).
Recently, Seinfeld has been working on the animated Bee Movie. Due in 
November, the movie follows Barry Benson, a bee who has just graduated 
from college. Unlike many bees, however, Benson is unsatisfied with a life 
of making honey. As he develops a relationship with a New York florist 
named Vanessa, Benson begins to see the wasteful ways of humans and 
their obsession with honey. In turn, Benson decides to sue the human 
race for honey, entangling the bee community and the human one.
Having done so much since Seinfeld, you'd think Jerry would want to 
spend some time with the family, enjoy his nice Porsche collection (rumor 
has it that he has one of the world's largest), and relax. But lucky for us, 
Seinfeld is still performing standup all over the world. On Saturday night, 
he comes to the Benedum Center for back-to-back standup performances.
Seinfeld was immensely popular for its show about nothing" attitude, 
exploiting the perils of day-to-day living (pressing questions such as "What 
does one do with the bottoms of muffins?" were frequently explored). 
Seinfelds standup isn't much different. Compared to other giants like 
Chris Rock and Robin Williams, Seinfeld's standup is pretty simple; you 
wont find any political commentary or over-the-top antics in his routine. 
Instead, Seinfeld usually digs into the atrocities of taxi driver body odor, 
and how the cherry air freshener in the back just makes things worse.
Jerry Seinfeld was behind one of the most successful television shows 
ever (76 million people watched the Seinfeld finale). In fact, Seinfeld was 
so popular that reruns still run in syndication. If the immense success and 
influence of his past career dont make it worth going to see him, then his 
fabulous sense of humor definitely does.

Deren Guler | Photo Editor*
Friday night, the CMU Robotics Club gathered in the UC pool to watch 1986 classic 
Short Circuit. It's a good thing the club members left their robots at home  otherwise, 
the film's title might have taken on an unfortunate double-meaning.
