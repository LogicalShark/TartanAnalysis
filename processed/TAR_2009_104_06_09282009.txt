Gates commends Carnegie Mellons ambition and advancements
MARIUM CHANDNA
Senior Staffwriter
Bill Gates, co-chair and trustee 
of the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation and chairman of 
Microsoft Corp., dedicated the 
Gates Center for Computer 
Science to the future of tech
nological progress at Carnegie 
Mellon.
It is an honor and privilege 
to be involved with Carnegie 
Mellon, said Gates in a keynote 
address to students and faculty. 
A ribbon-cutting ceremony fol
lowed the address.
Im always inspired when I 
come here  inspired by the 
great minds that are here and the 
ones that will be coming here, 
said Gates. Ill be following your 
work, and I cant wait to see 
these great advances [that] are 
delivered and the progress that 
will enable.
The Gates Center adjoins 
the Hillman Center for FutureGeneration Technologies, an
other research building where 
principles of computer science 
and robotics will be applied at a 
larger scale. Together, these two 
buildings house the School of
Computer Science (SCS), which 
contains classrooms, offices, 
research space, and a 360-foot 
long helix.
Designed by the renowned 
Mark Scogin Merrill Elam 
Architects of Atlanta, Ga., the 
centers sit at the crossroads of 
the campus, connecting it liter
ally from one end to the other. 
The new complex has five main 
entrances, as well as two pedes
trian bridges branching out to 
major parts of the campus, in
cluding Newell-Simon Hall.
The Randy Pausch Memorial 
Footbridge, a separate bridge 
that will be dedicated to late 
computer science professor 
Randy Pausch as a tribute to 
his vision for marrying areas of 
computer science with those of 
the arts, extends from the Gates 
Center to the edge of the Purnell 
Center for the Arts, the facil
ity that houses the universitys 
School of Drama.
It is great to see the ambition 
taking place in this particular 
project that the Foundation is 
helping to fund, Gates said of 
the new research center dediSee GATES, page A3

As part of the G20 events 
on Carnegie Mellons campus, 
Kevin Rudd, prime minister of 
the Commonwealth of Austra

to the campus community last 
Thursday. The prime minister
was among the 20 heads of state 
present in the city to discuss is
sues pertinent to global eco

After introducing the prime 
minister, Matthew Craig, a mas

Australia, and Patrick Bourke, a 
doctoral student in electrical and 
computer engineering, reflected
on how their Carnegie Mellon 
education coincides with Austra

Leaders of the worlds most 
prominent industrialized nations 
gathered in Pittsburgh last week 
for what will become a regular 
meeting to make economic deci
sions that will impact the econ
omy of the world.
This group of 20, or G20 
Summit, ran over two days, with 
dignitaries arriving Thursday 
for a working dinner hosted 
by President Obama at Phipps 
Conservatory. The Summit itself 
was held on Friday at the David 
L. Lawrence Convention Center 
downtown. It began at 9:30 a.m.
and concluded with press confer
ences given by leaders from vari
ous countries at around 5 p.m., 
with Obamas conference kicking 
off the string of meetings to fol
low.
Before discussing the results 
of the Summit, which focus on 
stabilizing the market and pre
venting another economic crisis 
like the one of fall 2008, Obama 
stressed the importance of na
tions working together to solve 
problems and thanked the peo
ple and the city of Pittsburgh for 
hosting the summit.
Many of the leaders, he said, 
were so impressed with the revi
talization of city since their last
visits, reinforcing Obamas choice 
to hold the Summit in Pittsburgh. 
Another signature Pittsburgh fea
ture the leaders were impressed 
by was a breakfast food.
Japanese Prime Minister 
Yukio Hatoyama ate breakfast 
at Pamelas in Millvale and was 
very pleased with the pancakes 
he was served.
Im a little resentful that I 
didnt get to Pamelas for pan
cakes, Obama joked.
Despite the lighthearted com
ments, Obama soon explained 
the results of the conference, and 
the four main points that the delSee G20, page A3

The Fence at Carnegie Mellon 
has traditionally been the meet
ing spot on campus where stu
dents voices resonate the loud
est.
On Saturday, a dozen protest
ers dressed in HAZMAT suits, 
green hard hats, and surgi
cal masks gathered around the 
shantytown to educate passersby 
on the current problems regard
ing the G20 and climate change. 
Others marched around the 
Fence beating drums, and some 
created flags and signs that could 
be used during the rally.
One activist, Dea G, march
ing with the Green and Black 
Contingent, stood near the Fence 
to bring attention to the need for 
radicalism in the climate change 
policies discussed in the G20.
The industrialization policies 
of the G20 have led to a com
plete destruction of our Earth, 
G said. Instead of asking Obama 
to make changes, [radicalism] 
means that if he doesnt make a 
change, we will stand here and 
make the change ourselves.
Gs message to Carnegie Mellon 
students was that although it is 
really easy to get trapped into a 
pattern of classes and activities, 
it is really important to become 
active.
During the week of the G20 
conference, picket signs with 
pleas to world leaders lay strewn 
around the Fence as a part of a 
senior project for art students

G20 protest groups organized at the Fence, ready to march downtown. The 
Fence also hosted an art project designed by Carnegie Mellon students.
Carolina Ramos and Austin 
Redwood.
The purpose of their project 
was to create an art space in 
which people could tangibly 
advertise their take on the G20 
summit. They used the Fence and 
its surrounding shantytown as 
a symbol of the great contro
versies that the G20 brought to 
Pittsburgh.
Dean of Student Affairs Karen 
D. Boyd felt that this shantytown 
resonated with the concept of 
students becoming involved in 
their passions, and said she be
lieves that this is what Carnegie 
Mellon is all about.
From an administrative stand
point, Boyd is there to allow 
Ramos and Redwood to achieve 
their dreams and help them com
ply with the safety parameters 
in place. I live in a country and 
a campus that shares the same 
beliefs as me, that the idea of 
the free exchange of ideas is al
ways better, Boyd said. I believe 
more students need to engage 
and think about what they are 
engaging in; thats the only way 
they will be able to grow.
For example, a group came 
to the Fence to join a rally that

and mass unemployment has become 
a durable, structural feature of South 
African society. Ferguson suggested 
that the South African experience 
reveals, in an extreme and clarify

drama and music professor at Carnegie 
Mellon, direct a concert for First Lady 
Michelle Obama and the other spouses 
of the G20 world leaders last Friday 
morning.
The performance was held at 
Pittsburghs Creative and Performing

Walking to the S
The infamous Walking to the Sky 
sculpture will see some construction 
this week, beginning today. The pole 
central to the art piece has often been 
seen wobbling, even in the face of no 
wind or compromising weather condi
tions.
At one point, the art structure was 
anchored by two cement blocks at
tached to cables in order to keep the 
pole from swaying. A new stainless 
steel pole design that will replace the 
current structure is proposed to mini
mize movement and maximize the sta
bility of the structure.
Jonathan Borofsky (A64) designed 
the piece, located in front of Warner 
Hall.
cy art excavated
The construction work will begin 
with an excavation of the base of the 
art piece. With the current plan, the 
existing sculpture will come down al
together beginning on Wednesday, and 
the construction work will continue 
for approximately two weeks. Most of 
the work will have to be done at the 
site of the sculpture; therefore, most of 
the Cut will be inaccessible during the 
time of construction. Other affected ar
eas include the two sidewalks between 
Forbes Avenue and the far end of the 
Purnell Center for the Arts.

Panel members focus on 
the role of art in protests

the panel discussion last week.
COURTNEY WinEKIND
Junior Staffwriter
The varied roles of perfor
mance as a part of protest, as 
a means of communication, 
and as a form of collective 
democracy were the focus of 
Power, Protest, Performance: 
A Panel Discussion, held last 
Wednesday.
Organized by Paul Eiss, direc
tor of Carnegie Mellons Center 
for Arts in Society (CAS), the 
panel was made up of three ex
perts on tactical performance: 
Larry Bogad, distinguished 
lecturer in performance and 
politics at the University of 
California; Richard Maddox, 
professor of anthropology and 
history at Carnegie Mellon; 
and Wendy Arons, associate 
professor of drama at Carnegie 
 Mellon.
The main speaker, Larry 
Bogad, highlighted the impor
tance of performative dis
ruption with examples from 
his experiences working with 
guerrilla theater groups includ
ing the Clandestine Insurgent 
Rebel Clown Army (CIRCA) 
and the Yes Men.
These groups attempt to 
get a dialogue going where 
we can explore not just what 
we are saying, but how we say 
it, Bogad said. One such ex
ample was the creation of the 
Oil Enforcement Agency  an 
agency devoted to ending what 
George W. Bush, in his 2006 
State of the Union address, 
called Americas addiction to 
oil.
There was a great space 
between [Bushs] rhetoric and 
reality. This space becomes a 
place for performers to dance, 
Bogad said.
The agency was deployed 
during the 2006 Los Angeles 
Auto Show, where the it tied 
crime scene tape around large 
vehicles, claiming that they 
were protecting the public from 
oil addiction. CIRCA, another of 
Bogads creations, is described 
on the website clownarmy.org 
as approximate and ambiva
lent ... the place in-between 
order and chaos.
CIRCA is known for showing 
up to protests and marches, in
terrupting rising tensions with 
spectacle.
The most intense moments 
of conflict can be defused by 
providing protest in a different 
form, Eiss said. You must be
the absurd change you wish to 
see, Bogad said.
Following Bogad were Wendy 
Arons and Richard Maddox, 
who both explored broader 
concepts pertaining to the G20 
Summit. Arons discussion, en
titled Why Am I Wearing this 
Polar Bear Mask? discussed 
the history of dramatic masking 
in relation to Section 601.19, a 
highly debated motion prohib
iting the use of masks,\hoods, 
or other identity-concealing 
devices during protests. Arons 
surmised that perhaps the law 
was asking the wrong ques
tion.
We should not ask, why do 
individuals wear masks, but 
what happens when they do 
so, said Arons. The effect of 
the mask is universal  it li
censes uncommon and often 
unruly behavior.
If we deny the power of the 
mask to move the wearer, we 
forget the joy of metamorpho
sis and change, said Aron.
Maddoxs piece was entitled 
Domestication, Disorder, and 
the Pittsburgh G20. The G20 
is a spectacle of legitimation 
for world leaders. Their main 
political agenda is to show the 
world that the right people are 
in charge and making correct 
decisions, said Maddox.
The choice to hold the G20 
in Pittsburgh has brought this 
spectacle to the universitys 
backyard. This choice has had 
dramatic effects on the city.
The messes of the past and 
present are to be swept under 
the rug.... Theres a tremen
dous sense of popular resent
ment; it isnt our city or our 
people being represented, said 
Maddox.
While Power, Protest, 
Performance focused heavily 
on the concept of performance, 
the questions raised by the 
panel reached past the form 
of protest and outside of the 
realm of the arts.
The panel was really posi
tive and gave a lot of interest
ing facts pertaining to protests 
and protesters, said Marielle 
Saums, a first-year art student.
The idea of involvement was 
also crucial, whether it takes 
the form of voting, protesting, 
or performance. We hope peo
ple walk away thinking not just 
about performance or about 
the G20, but asking Do we 
have a collective role in democ
racy?  said Eiss.
Top 20 economies discuss reform, policies
From G20, page A1
egation agreed upon.
First, he said, was sustaining 
recovery plans until economic 
growth is restored not just for the 
upper classes and businesses, but 
also for the working and middle 
class families who need to be able 
to pay their bills. We cant toler
ate the same old boom and bust 
economy of the past, he said.
To achieve this, he said, it was 
important to implement tough, 
new financial regulations. More 
transparency in business is a key 
element of this point. Those who 
abuse the system must be held re
sponsible, he emphasized.
A second point of the plan 
ties executive pay to long-term 
performance rather than short
term.
The third element is to phase 
out subsidies for fossil fuels, 
which will increase our energy 
security and decrease the threat 
posed by climate change.
The fourth point builds on 
Obamas earlier remarks about 
nations working together and 
reforms the system* of global 
economic cooperation and gov
ernance. This means that rather 
than only including alreadypowerful industrial nations, the 
International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) will begin to include 
emerging economies as well, and 
a new World Bank Trust Fund 
will be established.
The nations of the world share 
mutual interests, he said, and 
stressed that they should act on 
behalf of shared prosperity.
The cooperation on which 
Obama spoke Friday has been seen 
already in the response to Irans 
nuclear facilities. Intelligence 
agencies from the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and France 
each investigated whether Irans 
statements about their facilities 
were truthful or whether they 
were in violation of international 
laws. After they confirmed the 
violation, other countries, in
cluding China and Russia, joined 
these countries in condemning 
Irans actions.
Leaders from these countries 
will be meeting with Iran on Oct. 
1 to try to solve the problem dip
lomatically, but Obama said that 
he would not rule out any options 
or possibilities for further action. 
Iran is on notice. They are going 
to have to come clean and make 
a choice, he said. The first path 
leads to peace, and the second to 
confrontation.
While these things were occur
ring on the international political 
fronts, protesters gathered out
side, surrounded by swarms of 
police dressed in riot gear.
All week, demonstrators 
have gathered to protest vari
ous causes, ranging from the war 
to capitalism to the G20 itself. 
Some protesters, like those de
siring to free Tibet and the op
pressed Chinese religious group 
Falun Gong, were peaceful, but 
other protests became riotous 
and violent.
Obama was not concerned 
about the riots. Its important 
to keep things in perspective, 
he said. In London, there were 
hundreds of thousands on the 
streets [as compared with the 
just over 5000 reported to be out
side of the Convention Center]. 
Pittsburgh deserves credit for 
managing a very tranquil G20 
Summit.
While the Summit may have 
been tranquil compared to 
other Summits, the protesters 
certainly caused a stir in the city. 
Throughout the course of the 
week, nearly 20 businesses were 
damaged, reportedly by the same 
protesters from California, and 
over 100 people were arrested for 
refusal to disperse.
In Oakland last Thursday, stu
dents gathered to protest, and po
lice broke up the group with the 
use of OC gas, which is slightly 
different from tear gas, as it is 
a different chemical compound 
more similar to pepper spray. To 
revolt against police actions, stu
dents gathered again Friday and 
were met with equally strong riot 
dispersal tactics.
Twitter updates and YouTube 
videos gave the world a close-up 
look at the police actions and 
protests happening in the city.
Two students from Carnegie
Mellon created a website that 
compiled the most recent videos 
and Tweets relating to the G20. 
Haris Krijestorac and Manolis 
Kounelakis, masters students 
in information systems manage
ment, originally did not intend 
for their website, www.exponentialweb.com, to focus on G20. 
We both have many theories 
and ideas about where the social 
web is taking the world, and we 
wanted to share our youthful yet 
academic perspective with the 
world, Krijestorac stated in an 
e-mail.
The site was created Sept. 20, 
and by Sept. 24, the first day 
of the Summit, Krijestorac and 
Kounelakis began posting live 
updates from social websites, al
lowing people to follow what was 
going on in real time.
We hope that ExponentialWeb 
will not only give us the outlet to 
report social web news and ex
press our opinions on the subject, 
but inspire others to engage in 
it, Krijestorac wrote.
This website, as well as the 
original sites from which the ma
terial was taken, engaged many 
in the events of the weekend, 
supplementing traditional news 
sources with information straight 
from the participants.
Whether through protests, 
art, or social websites, very few 
people managed to avoid partici
pating in one way or another in 
this event.

Carnegie Mellon student 
Elaine Lee has been awarded the 
Vanguard Women in Information 
Technology Scholarship for 2009 
for her work in math and com
puter science.
Originally from New Jersey, 
Lee is a senior math major on the 
occupations research track and is 
looking at a minor in computer 
science and statistics.
Math just made sense to me, 
Lee said. Her interest in math, 
and specifically occupations re
search, sparked during her se
nior year of high school, where 
she and a partner participated in 
the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science annual 
meeting in 2006. Their project 
was about using genetic algo
rithms in order to solve the trav
eling salesman problem. At the 
competition, she met with the 
American Mathematical Society, 
which provided her with infor
mation about jobs for math ma
jors once they leave college.
She was immediately drawn to 
the pamphlets about operations
cated by his foundation.
Gates previously visited 
Carn6gie Mellon last February. 
He was once again welcomed 
to the campus last Tuesday af
ternoon by a throng of students 
and faculty members in Wiegand 
Gymnasium, in the University 
Center, where he shared his 
thoughts on the universitys tech
nological initiatives, as well as 
technological outreach world
wide.
Pioneering work in computer 
science has been going on [at 
Carnegie Mellon] for over half a 
century, said Gates.
Gates acknowledged the farreaching accomplishments of the 
SCS in computer science, robot
ics, human-computer interac
tion, and artificial intelligence. 
He also recognized the schools 
Open Learning Initiative: a proj
ect that uses online interactive 
material to adapt to students 
learning needs. It enables profes
sors to gauge classroom perfor
mance and spot where gaps in 
knowledge need to be filled in.
The potential for using comput
ing in areas like computational 
biology will not only continue, 
but accelerate, he said.
Robotics is a great example 
 whether its learning, vision, 
speech-recognition, or mechani
cal modeling  all of these things 
get pushed to the state-of-the art 
here; [Carnegie Mellon] has been 
a leader in that, said Gates.
The layout of this new com
plex strengthens the collabora
tion between different fields of 
study  an important trend here 
at Carnegie Mellon, Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared L. Cohon 
said.
Students and faculty of the 
School of Computer Science 
moved into the new buildings in 
August.
The Gates Center provides

ronment for computer science 
projects, said Hatem Alismail, a 
masters student at the' Robotics

ing projects, she said. Its about 
how to use resources as efficiently 
as possible. From the math field, 
Lee hoped to go into whatever 
technical field she wanted.
Once she arrived at Carnegie 
Mellon, she also gained an ap
preciation for computer science 
and statistics.
The Vanguard Women scholar
ship grants merit-based financial 
aid of up to $8000 each year to 
any female college undergradu

She first heard about the schol
arship from Vanguard itself. After 
being turned down for an intern
ship, she continued to receive 
news on their affairs. She occa
sionally gets e-mails on scholar

One day, Lee received an email about the scholarship and 
decided to apply. She also re
ceived some information through 
Carnegie Mellon. To enter, she 
had to get a copy of her transcript

a new alcove or meeting space. 
The common areas and offices 
are comfortable places to work 
and collaborate with my peers.
Bernardine Dias, an assistant 
research professor in the Robotics 
Institute, said, The new complex 
is an inviting space for people 
crossing the borders of all disci
plines and reaching out to each 
other; it is very accessible.
This university earned its rep
utation by marching in the direc
tion of new concepts with a vision 
and courage to go where others 
would not tread, said Randal 
E. Bryant, dean of the School of 
Computer Science. And this has 
been a catalyst for us to grow in 
our partnership with our con
tributors, he said.
According to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, a $20 million gift 
from the Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation and a $10 million 
gift from the Henry L. Hillman 
Foundation led to the completion 
of this new research complex.
The generosity of the Gates 
and Hillman Foundations and 
our many other donors will have 
a lasting impact on our univer
sity, said Cohon. These buildplication. It included a personal 
statement of about 200-300 
words in which she had to in
clude the reasons why she should 
win the scholarship and what her 
future career plans were.
Ultimately, she would like to 
work for a company in which 
she could work on data analy
sis and simulation. She hopes 
her research could come to 
some interesting conclusions 
that can influence the way we 
do things. Lee shows particular 
interest in global warming and 
climate change. The data just 
isnt there, she said, which she 
attributes to the reason so few 
bills on the subject get passed. 
Theres not a lot of work going 
on in that area.
One of Lees many accomplish
ments on campus was a com
puter science research project 
her sophomore year. As part 
of the Intel First Year Research 
Experience (IFYRE), she worked 
with professor Martial Herbert 
on new video surveillance tech
nologies. They focused on event 
detection in crowded videos. Lee 
said, The goal of the research 
was to teach the computer to 
identify people.
According to Lee, the most ful
filling class that shes taken at 
Carnegie Mellon is data mining, 
which she is taking this semes
ter. Part of the statistics depart
ment, the class is concerned with 
learning different techniques for 
extracting meaningful parts from 
large pools of information. It 
was very real-world, Lee said.
She traveled abroad during the 
spring semester of her junior year. 
She spent five months overseas 
at the University of Manchester, 
where she enjoyed the luxury 
of taking few technical classes 
and exploring Europe, including 
Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Italy, 
and France.
In addition to her course 
load, shes part of the Student 
Technology Outreach Center on 
campus, in which shes worked 
on a number of projects, from 
teaching basic courses on com
puting for students and adults to 
computer recycling.
Her plans for the award 
money? Paying for tuition here, 
she said.
ings have already transformed 
our campus, making it more 
cohesive, more functional, and 
more beautiful. They have been 
designed from the ground up 
to meet the needs of our com
puter science students and fac
ulty, whose work continues to 
transform science, society, and 
the arts.
Carnegie Mellons long-stand
ing tradition of collaborative 
work appeared to be in sync with 
Gates vision for the future of 
learning on a global scale. We 
need to revolutionize education, 
said Gates. The experience that 
[students] have at Carnegie 
Mellon is unfortunately an excep
tion, not the rule, he said.
Gates also said that having a 
sound and up-to-date education 
is one of the most critical steps 
toward personal and professional 
development, as well as global 
socioeconomic progress. On his 
philanthropic efforts, Gates said 
that it is fun giving money away 
and seeing it being used wisely. 
This is an historic day not 
just for the School of Computer 
Science, but for all of Carnegie 
Mellon University ... and for all 
of Pittsburgh, said Cohon. It 
signifies the absolutely crucial 
role that this [university] plays... 
in the world, he said.

there, said Craig, a resident of 
Adelaide.
The Heinz College Australia, 
an extension of the Heinz College 
in Pittsburgh, began operations' 
in 2006 and has produced over 
130 graduates. Carnegie Mellon 
is the first foreign university to 
have been granted permission to 
offer its own degree program in 
Australia.
This university has grown to 
become one of the great Ameri
can universities, Rudd said. It 
is a global research university 
that is making a great contribu
tion to higher education in Aus
tralia, he said.
The prime minister also recog
nized Andrew Carnegies instru
mental role in the progress of the 
steel industry in the past and the 
present leadership of Carnegie 
Mellon in technology and inno
vation.
But Carnegies university, 
rather than a steel company, is 
what provided a transforma
tional vehicle for the old city 
of heavy industry to become 
the new city of the future, one 
grounded in the globalizing 
knowledge economy of the 21st 
century, Rudd said.
The prime minister has been 
among the most outspoken and 
most forceful heads of govern
ment in the world when it comes 
to global warming, said Carn
egie Mellon President Jared L. 
Cohon.
Unlike heads of most govern
ments in the world, he has made 
actual commitments, something 
we all should be very grateful 
for. His leadership has had a big 
impact, he said.
Rudd displayed his knowledge 
of Pittsburghs history and cul
ture, blending humor with rele
vant facts about the G20 host city 
and its historic feat at economic 
recovery since the collapse of the
steel industry.
This is my first time to Pitts
burgh, and my first time to this 
university. So as a very proud 
self-proclaimed nerd, I sat down 
last night to Google a little about 
what I was to come to discover 
here in Pittsburgh, said Rudd. 
And knowing that Ill be speak
ing to a room full of nerds, I 
thought youd appreciate that, 
he added, drawing laughter from 
the audience.
The prime minister said that 
while the agenda of the G20 is 
broad, it essentially deals with 
two sets of fundamental threats 
to our common future: the global 
financial crisis and the looming 
crisis of climate change. He also 
said that these two themes make 
Pittsburgh an ideal location for 
this Summit.
Pittsburgh harbors a culture 
of constant reinvention. Both 
these crises represent transfor
mational opportunities for the 
future, transformational oppor
tunities for the world, just as you 
have succeeded in transforming 
this great city, said Rudd.
The prime minister went on to 
focus on strong climate change 
policies as a catalyst in trigger
ing lasting economic progress. 
He stressed the importance of 
carbon capture and sequestra
tion  an area he said was of 
crucial concern to the G20.
Climate change presents a 
long-term threat to our planet, 
said Rudd.
He explained that by 2020, 
between 75 and 250 million peo
ple could be exposed to climate 
change-induced water shortages. 
Also, rain-fed agricultural yields 
could drop by 50 percent in some 
African countries.
Further, rising sea levels could 
affect more than 1 million people 
in such countries as Bangladesh, 
Vietnam, and Egypt. If due action 
is not taken, global temperatures 
could rise more than 10 degrees
Fahrenheit within this century 
alone.
These changes will affect 
everyone, irrespective of na
tion or people  this is a global 
challenge requiring a global re
sponse, said Rudd.
I think that [Rudds] explana
tions of the numbers related to 
the carbon emission reduction, 
and sequestration projects over 
the country really show how im
portant he thinks the problem 
is, said Urmila Rosario, a junior 
in business administration.
I really think that this makes 
him unique in comparison to the 
other leaders of developed coun
tries, but then again, I think that 
all world leaders talk too much 
and actually do nothing, she 
said.
Rudd also talked about the sig
nificant role that educated youth 
plays in bringing about a positive 
change in both the economic and 
environmental architecture of 
the post-crisis world.
Our core challenge will be to 
convert adversity into opportu
nity, threat into possibility, and 
deploy the technologies that lie 
within our reach and the finance 
necessary to deploy them to deal 
with climate change, and as a 
result, create new skills, jobs, 
and industries for American and 
global economies for the 21st 
century, the prime minister 
said.
A panel .discussion on the 
prime ministers talk and the 
G20 agenda followed the key
note address. Meanwhile, the 
prime minister spoke to the local 
and school media in a separate 
press conference.
During the press conference, 
he elaborated further on how the 
G20 will aim to transform the 
global economy to a lower car
bon world through carbon mar
kets, private and public global 
finance, and applicable technol
ogy platforms.

From PROTEST, page A1
wanted world leaders to focus on 
issues such as education, rather 
than ones such as militarism.
After making signs that read 
Students, not Soldiers, they 
hung up the signs as art in the 
shantytown.
Boyd said that this physical 
expression of a social event truly 
embodies the purpose of the 
makeshift slum. The signs and 
protest later made the New York 
Times. Ramos and Redwood ex
emplified the engagement that 
both Boyd and G encourage.
Ramos, who has been work
ing extensively with her partner 
Redwood, was inspired to build 
the slum culture as her project to 
visually represent those who are 
unrepresented in the G20.
I have a lot of separate issues 
that I think the G20 could ex
press, but as I see it, all they are 
focusing their energy on is the 
massive amount of money they 
are going to be redistributing 
to the International Monetary 
Fund, Ramos said. I think the 
IMF is an organ of government 
that has caused a lot more harm 
than good to the world.
She feels that the structural 
readjustment policies threaten 
the social safety nets of the in
dividuals that live in poverty. In 
order to express her passion for 
this issue, Ramos and Redwood 
set up the shantytown to repre
sent three different aspects of 
the G20.
First, Ramos painted a utopian 
kingdom on one of the makeshift 
walls to represent the idealism 
that is often associated with the
G20.
Boyd interpreted that on one 
side of this wall is art that repre
sents what some students feel is 
the reality of the conference.
Graffiti with messages of de
spair and broken, boarded walls 
surround this section. This sec
tion is to represent those who are 
unrepresented and often lost in 
the sea of poverty.
Boyd said that the final section 
of the structure is to represent 
that even those who live in mid
dle class America are affected 
by the lack of progress made in 
the G20.
A major aspect of this set up, 
however, is that the Fence ex
presses not only the idea of the 
founders of the project, but the 
beliefs and ideologies of every 
passerby who wishes to contrib
ute to the structure.
Boyd feels that all students, 
in one way or another, should 
get involved and truly interact in 
what they are passionate about.
Her belief in freedom of ex
pression held strong even when 
the Fence was taken over by 
Kappa Sigma on the night of 
Sept. 24.
Another exciting thing is that 
the frat took the Fence, and thats 
an example of freedom of expres
sion too, Boyd said. Now they 
are coexisting with the shanty
town, which just reinforces what 
it means to be a part of Carnegie 
Mellon.
As Boyd states, the !Fence is a 
way to express the frustrations 
and passions of the people, but it 
is also a way to document some 
of the major themes that have 
surrounded the G20.

AIDS vaccine shows 
promising results
According to a study con
ducted in Thailand, a new 
vaccine for HIV has been 
shown to reduce the risk of be
ing infected by the virus by 31 
percent.
The study was conducted on 
more than 16,000 volunteers 
and has shown the best results 
out of such tests conducted so 
far. The vaccine administered 
was a combination of two 
vaccines, each of which has a 
different method of agency. 
Each vaccine was not very 
effective when administered 
individually, but the combina
tion of the two proved to be 
good at preventing infection. 
Researchers do not think that 
the vaccine can be released 
just yet, but are starting to plan 
ways to improve the vaccine 
so that its effectiveness can be 
increased.

Early antiviral use 
helps with swine flu
The World Health Organiza
tion believes that administering 
antivirals to patients displaying 
symptoms of swine flu early on 
will help cure the patients and 
prevent the disease from be
coming more severe.
Statistics from across the 
world have shown that treat
ment of patients with drugs like 
oseltamivir and zanamivir right 
after the onset of symptoms 
prevents the development of 
further complications from the 
disease.
The WHO recommended that 
people should not take the anti
virals as a preventive measure 
before they have symptoms of 
the disease, as this could exacer
bate the development of a drugresistant form of the virus.

MRSA infections 
spread to pets
The drug-resistant Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus 
Aureus (MRSA) bacterium has 
typically been common in hu
mans, especially in those who 
have been hospitalized for a 
long time. However, recently 
the germ has started infecting 
animals including dogs, cats, 
and rabbits. Researchers now 
believe that it is easy for animal 
caretakers to contract MRSA.
Researchers believe that the 
germ may have been initially 
transmitted to these animals 
from humans.
As a preventive measure, 
doctors recommend pet own
ers wash their hands before and 
after playing with the pets and 
not allow the pets to lick their 
faces.

Alcohol may help 
with brain injury
According to a study pub
lished in the Archives of Sur
gery, alcohol may help patients 
recover from traumatic brain 
injuries.
Out of the patients studied,
38 percent had alcohol in their 
bloodstreams, and these pa
tients had a lower risk of dying 
than those who did not have 
any alcohol in their blood.
Since alcohol consumption is 
the major cause for many acci
dents leading to brain trauma, 
researchers do not believe that 
drinking is good for the pa
tients, but believe that this new 
discovery could lead to the de
velopment of better treatments.

The DeLorean from Back to the 
Future set the standard for cars 
of the future  cars of 2015, ac
cording to the movie. In 1985, 
when the movie was released, 
most cars still resorted to using 
wheels driven by piston engines. 
Around the same time, a less fa
mous engine was only being per
fected and was assumed to be the 
real future of cars. The Wankel 
engine was this little-known en
gine that promised so much.
The Wankel engine is a type 
of rotary engine. Rotary engines 
have been in existence since 
World War I and have been used 
in some aircraft, motorcycles, 
and automobiles ever since. The 
Wankel engine was invented 
by Felix Wankel, an engineer at 
NSU Motorenwerke AG. In 1964, 
NSU unveiled their first car to 
use this engine, the NSU Spider. 
Time magazine explained that it 
took NSU 10 years of engineer
ing before this new engine could 
be commercially produced with 
satisfactory results. This new 
engine, weighing about half as 
much as a conventional piston 
engine of the same capacity, 
seemed promising at the time. 
High-profile companies such as 
Curtiss-Wright Corp., Outboard 
Marine Corp., and Rolls-Royce 
paid NSU licenses for the Wankel 
engine, as it was the belief at the 
time that Wankel engines would 
replace piston engines.
Over the years, the Wankel 
engine has been put to a number 
of uses that include airplane, mo
torcycle, and race car engines. 
However, very few automobile 
companies have adopted this 
engine. The Japanese automo
bile manufacturer Mazda Motor 
Corp. is notably the biggest user 
of Wankel engines in their ve
hicles. The Wankel engine pro
duces energy by turning a rotor 
within a housing. The rotor is tri
angular, with convex sides and 
pockets on the three faces. These 
pockets hold the fuel and provide 
the chamber for fuel ignition. The 
housing is roughly oval in shape, 
resembling a figure eight with a 
broader mid-section (this figure 
is called an epitrochoid).
Within the housing, the rotor 
spins about a central gear and 
output shaft. The fuel inlet and 
exhaust outlet ports, along with 
the spark plugs, are on the walls 
of the housing. These ports do 
not require valves as in standard 
piston engines, and are directly

Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
(SMA) is the name given to a 
group of inherited genetic dis
eases characterized by the loss 
of motor neurons, which are 
the nerve cells that transmit im
pulses from the brain or spinal 
cord to muscle tissue.
This inability of the brain and 
muscle tissue to communicate 
with each other results in se
vere muscle weakness and atro
phy in the muscles closest to the 
trunk of the body, which are the 
muscles necessary for crawling, 
walking, sitting up, and head 
control, though other muscles 
can be affected as well.
SMA is an autosomal recessive 
genetic disease, which means 
that for a child to have SMA, both 
parents must be carriers of the 
abnormal SMA gene, and both 
must pass this gene on to their 
child. This makes the chance 
of a child inheriting the disease
and speaker? This new nano has 
some things weve never seen 
on an iPod before  or at least I 
havent seen; I was still boppin 
along to the nano from 2005.
Along with the new finish and 
bigger screen, the most notice
able physical change is the ad
dition of a video camera on the 
back of the iPod. Owners can 
now capture live footage of pro
testers at the Fence or friends 
snoring in class, in portrait or
connected to the throttle and 
exhaust, respectively. This helps 
reduce the complexity of the en
gine by decreasing the number of 
parts involved.
The rotary engine conserves 
some of the energy that otherwise 
would have been lost in changing 
the direction of motion of the pis
tons by using the energy to turn 
the rotor. In internal combustion 
engines, pistons  or the rotor as 
in the case of the rotary engine
 are driven by fuel ignition. In 
the case of reciprocating engines, 
these pistons are allowed only 
a single degree of freedom. The 
pistons have to move up along 
an axis before changing their 
direction of motion and moving 
down along the same axis. In the 
rotary engine, the rotor is again 
allowed only one degree of free
dom: rotatory. This allows the 
rotor to be driven continuously 
along the same direction. As the 
rotor spins, the engine sees the 
same four strokes a conventional 
piston engine does. The fuel enfrom two patients who are car
riers one in four, or 25 percent. 
The gene that is affected is sur
vival motor neuron 1, or SMN1. 
This gene produces the survival 
motor neuron protein, and a de
ficiency of this protein can have 
a severe effect on motor neurons. 
Without the protein, the motor 
neurons can atrophy, shrink, 
and eventually die. One in every 
40 people, or 7.5 million Ameri
cans, is a carrier of the gene that 
causes SMA, which leads to one 
in every 6000 children being 
born with SMA.
SMA is broken up into differ
ent types, or categories, depend
ing on the age of onset and the 
diseases severity. Type I SMA, 
called Werdnig-Hoffmann Dis
ease, is the most severe of the dif
ferent types, and the diagnosis of 
children with this type is usually 
made before 6 months of age.
Patients with this form are 
generally unable to sit unsup
ported, have trouble eating and 
swallowing, and have underde
landscape mode. With the big
ger 2.2-inch screen, you can also 
choose from 15 video effects to 
jazz up your home videos, such 
as sepia, black and white, and 
kaleidoscope, according to the 
advertisements. I have been un
successful in trying to find these 
cool features, but Im sure Ill 
come across them. With the click 
of a mouse, the videos are on a 
laptop, posted on Facebook, and 
now everyone can watch someters the housing through the in
let port in the inlet stroke before 
the rotor compresses the fuel 
in the second stroke. The spark 
plugs ignite the fuel in the third 
stroke, causing a rapid expan
sion of gases, which turns the ro
tor further and pushes the waste 
gases to the exhaust port in the 
fourth stroke.
The Wankel engine is also com
posed of fewer and less complex 
parts than in piston engines. This 
has allowed for extremely small 
such engines to be built. In 2001, 
Carlos Fernandez-Pello, from the 
University of California at Berke
ley, successfully tested a Wankel 
engine the size of a penny. The 
idea behind micro-sized engines 
is that they produce more power 
than contemporary power cells 
for the same size. They can also 
be refueled instead of discarded, 
reducing costs associated with 
waste and disposal. While the 
Wankel engine has an innova
tive design and a satisfactorily 
high power-to-weight ratio for
veloped lungs and a weak cough. 
Type II is usually diagnosed in 
patients less than 2 years of age 
and is less severe than Type I. Pa
tients can often sit unsupported, 
and can get into a standing posi
tion with some sort of assistive 
device. Scoliosis, or the curving 
of the spine, is very common 
in Type II patients, as are weak 
lungs like patients with Type I. 
Type III SMA is also known as 
Kugelberg-Welander or Juvenile 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy and has 
a much greater range in time of 
onset.
Patients with Type III can stand 
on their own and walk, though 
they may have difficulty walking 
at some point in their life, usually 
associated with a growth spurt 
or illness. These patients often 
have difficulty walking, and will 
fall more than normal and have 
a more difficult time righting 
themselves.
The last form of SMA, Type 
IV, is the adult onset form of the 
disease, and is much rarer than

an engine, it has not seen wide
spread use, and this is primarily 
due to the comparatively high 
emissions. The shape of the rotor 
introduces a number of problems 
involving the seals of the rotor 
and housing. This engine also 
uses more fuel than a piston en
gine, rendering it an expensive 
proposition for a mainstream 
car. In races and for propeller 
airplanes, this engine is partic
ularly advantageous due to its 
light weight.
The Wankel engine today sees 
more applications in fields other 
than the automobile industry for 
which it was initially intended. 
Apart from its use in races and 
aircraft, this engine is used in a 
number of recreational applica
tions, such as model planes and 
go-karts. The engine is still far

periods of time.

to a great increase in knowledge 
and understanding about how 
the disease works. Not only was 
the SMN1 gene identified as the 
cause of SMA, and its produc
tion of the SMN protein found 
to affect the motor neurons, but 
another gene was also found: 
SMN2.
This gene is believed to be a 
partially functioning backup 
gene that makes about 10 per
cent as much of the SMN protein 
as a healthy SMN1 gene would 
produce. The current research 
is focusing on drugs and treat
ments that could help enhance 
SMN2s production of the SMN 
protein in order to bring them up 
to healthy SMN1 levels.

Research deciphers 
images in brain
Scientists have come up with 
a new method to model images 
based on neural activity from 
the subjects. In the future, this 
technique could possibly lead 
to the development of devices 
like dream readers or thoughtcontrolled computers.
In the study, published in the 
journal Neuron, researchers col
lected fMRI data, which mea
sures blood flow in the brain, 
from three subjects as they 
looked at pictures of ordinary 
objects and scenes. Later, after 
coming up with a model based 
on this data, the subjects looked 
at another set of pictures, and 
by analyzing the neural output, 
the researchers were able to 
pick the corresponding pictures 
from a set of around 6 million 
images.

Data shows water 
on moon
Data from three different 
spacecraft show that there may 
be water on the moon. The most 
recent space mission to show 
that the moon contains water 
was Indias Chandrayaah4 
mission. Chandrayaan-1 col
lected data of the sunlight re
flected from the surface of the 
moon and found that light was 
absorbed at the wavelength at 
which water normally absorbs 
infrared light.
Data was also analyzed from 
NASAs Cassini spacecraft, 
which passed the moon nearly a 
decade ago, and from the Deep 
Impact spacecraft. Analysis ;of 
data from the Cassini spacecraft 
indicates the presence of hy
droxyl molecules mostly at the 
poles on the moon. Data from 
the Deep Impact spacecraft also 
indicates that the absorption of 
light changes with differences 
in temperature.

MIT develops eye 
implant
Researchers working at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology have developed 
an eye implant that could help 
restore vision to the blind. As 
of now, the implant has been 
designed for patients suffering 
from retinitis pigmentosa or 
age-related macular degenera
tion.
The prosthetic device makes 
up for a damaged retina by elec
trically stimulating the nerve 
cells that normally carry the 
visual stimulus from the retina 
to the brain.
Although such a device can
not completely restore vision 
to the visually impaired, it can 
help them perform daily tasks, 
such as navigating through a 
room, far more easily.

New find strengthens 
dinosaur-bird link
Chinese scientists have found 
new evidence that agrees with 
the hypothesis that birds de
scended from dinosaurs. The 
researchers have found a very 
well-preserved fossil of a dino
saur species known as Anchiornis huxleyi. The fossil shows 
that the species had four wings 
and also had feathers.
This finding indicates that 
that the Anchiornis huxleyi 
could be the missing link be
tween dinosaurs and birds. 
Anchiornis huxleyi was present 
even before the Archaeopteryx, 
which is considered to be the 
earliest bird. Since bird-like fea
tures were found in the Anchi
ornis huxleyi, it indicates th$t 
features resembling birds were 
present in the early dinosaurs 
as well.

Brand new eco-friendly iPod nano boasts extra features
IPOD, fromA6
friends listen to the new CD 
you purchased and put on your 
iPod. If they liked the sound of 
that band, you can use the click 
wheel to create a Genius playlist. 
Just like in iTunes, the iPod nano 
will create a new playlist with 
similar songs, and you have the 
option of saving the playlist if 
you like what you hear. The only 
thing about this feature on the 
iPod, just like on iTunes, is that 
you only get a good Genius mix 
if you have a lot of music that fits 
the right profile. If you only have 
a few similar songs on your iPod, 
dont expect an amazing Genius 
playlist. Go purchase more music 
instead.
In case you get tired of listen
ing to your own music, just turn 
on your iPods FM radio. Compat
ible stations will scroll the name 
of the song and artist, and along 
with this new radio comes Live 
Pause and iTunes tagging, de
signed to enhance the listening 
experience.
Live Pause enables listeners on 
their way to class to pause their 
favorite station and talk to some
one, then resume listening to 
their station again.
Thetechnology even allows 
rewinding as far back as 15 
minutes and fast forwarding to 
catch up with the live station. Its 
pretty nifty. iTunes tagging is for 
every person whos ever heard a 
song on the radio and wanted to 
download it, but couldnt remem
ber the name of it. Users can sim
ply use the click wheel to tag the 
songs they hear on the radio that 
they like, and the iPod makes a 
list of the tagged songs.
When you connect the iPod to 
your computer, the tagged list is 
in iTunes and you can purchase
the songs. Unfortunately for in
ternational students, so far this 
technology only works in the 
United States.
So theres video, theres radio; 
what else is so amazing about this 
thing? The pedometer, because 
everyone has always wanted
one of those. No, really, for the 
motivated people who keep up a 
fitness plan, or for anyone whos 
just curious, the new pedometer 
feature offers a daily step goal or 
the option to continually count 
steps all the time. It can also keep 
track of how many calories you
Celia Ludwinski/Assistant Photo Editor
burn a day.
And while listening to your 
iPod on your bike or on your run, 
as the pedometer counts your 
calories and steps, the new Voice 
Over technology seamlessly tells 
you which song is playing. This 
technology is already popular on
the iPod shuffle, but maybe hear
ing it on the nano is different be
cause it sounds rather computer
ized.
I feel like its rather unneces
sary, but I guess if you really have 
so much music that youve forgot
ten the name of the song youre 
listening to, and your hands are 
occupied with whatever, it could 
be nice.
Most users would agree that 
there are certain new features 
that trump the Voice Over. I 
think the best thing they put 
on the new nano was the video 
camera and the built-in mic and 
speakers, said Cole Vandross, a 
first-year mechanical engineer
ing major. Others agree that the 
new nano is supreme.
The 2.2-inch screen and 240- 
by-376 resolution really maxi
mizes the look of the videos and 
the cover art flow, said James 
Williams, a sophomore computer 
science major.
It makes me feel like my old 
new iPod is obsolete now; I have 
to get this new one. Apple did 
more than just add new shiny 
features to the nano, and Van
dross noticed this. I also appre
ciate Apples efforts in being a 
part of the green movement with 
the mercury-free LED-backlit 
display and the recyclable alumi
num case. So when I am on my 
way to class, the sounds of the 
traffic on Fifth Avenue cant com
pete with the environmentally 
friendly iPod nano, counting my 
steps all the way to Wean Hall.

G20 Summit turns all eyes onto the city
We learned this past week that 
Pittsburgh is not London. This 
April, the previous years G20 location 
saw several thousands of protesters 
along with a very violent police response 
that ultimately resulted in two deaths 
and a bank robbery that occurred dur
ing the ensuing chaos.
The police presence that Pittsburgh 
residents saw was much stronger and 
more forceful than it probably needed 
to be for the number of actual protest
ers  compared to gawkers, onlookers, 
and people with cameras (i.e. students)
 who actually took part in the dem
onstrations and marches that were di
rected at world leaders.
The experience of walking around in
side the security perimeter downtown 
was like starring in an end-of-the-world
#
 Carnegie Mellon carried itself in
credibly well through this past 
week. Right off the heels of the Gates 
Hillman dedication, the university 
transformed itself into an efficient ma
chine for dealing with Pittsburgh being 
in the spotlight on the world stage.
The university successfully and safely 
hosted both the richest man in the world 
and the prime minister of Australia, with 
the help, of course, of the large numbers 
of police and security officers that could 
be found in every corner of the campus. 
Police officers could also be seen being 
transported around Oakland in PAT
While there was a pervasive campus sentiment of whats-that-junkon-the-fence, the art project that created 
a haven for education, discourse, and 
free speech was successful.
The project was actually approved be
forehand by the administration, and was 
a unique way of speaking out against the 
G20 in a manner that could not be found 
elsewhere in the city.
However, it might have been nice to 
get more of the campus community inWith the White House already 
planning to demand nuclear in
spections in Iran, progress was indeed 
made at the G20.
We arent so sure, however, that the 
limited time spent locked up in the Con
vention Center was the sole source of 
these developments. Our world leaders 
should continue to communicate regu
larly, with events like the G20 Summits
film, with the National Guard on every 
corner and tall steel barricades lining 
the streets. While several University of 
Pittsburgh students are still shouting 
about the injustices that occurred on 
their campus, we think it is likely both 
the protests and resulting police behav
ior will fade.
Pittsburgh  Sixburgh  has re
cently recovered from the riots after the 
Steelers won the Super Bowl in Febru
ary. Once again, in response to the G20, 
crowds of people streamed through 
Oakland, causing inexplicable prop
erty damage in the forms of rocks being 
thrown at storefront windows due to 
peoples heightened emotional state and 
mob mentality.
While McDonalds and Subway can 
certainly recover from a few smashed
buses marked as special.
There was a great deal of uncertainty 
and wild anticipation throughout the 
campus. Students and faculty alike la
mented the late notice about building 
and road closings, with some professors 
even insisting at the beginning of last 
week that they would still be holding 
class, only to be undercut by official emails later. However, campus admin
istration cannot be faulted, since they 
were likely awaiting information from 
government officials. Safety for both 
students and staff as well as the visiting 
world leaders had to be considered when
volved, or at least aware of, the projects 
intentions. If more students across mul
tiple disciplines were involved in and 
made aware of the faux-tent citys inten
tions and creation, the shantytown could 
have been taken a bit more seriously by 
the campus community as a whole.
Many students were unhappy with 
the projects placement at the Fence, be
lieving that that was not the appropriate 
place for the project and as students of a 
privately owned university, they should
acting as milestones to solidify the work 
that theyve already been doing.
In terms of the lasting impacts of the 
G20 Summit, it is hard to say as of now 
what the outcome will be. It is too soon 
to see if any of the decisions made at the 
summit will be cemented and expanded 
upon in the future by the nations and 
leaders involved.
It is safe to say, however, that Pittswindows, local establishments like Pa
melas will find recovery a bit harder. 
This local Pittsburgh business, which 
actually received a lot of great press 
this week from leaders fantastic experi
ences with the pancakes, was unneces
sarily targeted, undermining the whole 
point behind the protesters actions, 
which were supposedly demonstrations 
against big business.
It is certainly important for people 
in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas 
to come together and protest to take a 
stand for what they believe in, and we 
are glad to know that Pittsburghers have 
an opinion about something other than 
football. But just as we stated after the 
Steelers riots, breaking windows and 
causing other violence is not the correct 
way to show what you believe.
making the closings, even if teachers 
would have preferred to keep teaching.
Road and building closings happened 
mostly as planned, and the campus 
generally maintained a level of sanity 
throughout Thursday and Friday as the 
various G20-related events were occur
ring downtown. While individual stu
dents likely took part in the protests, 
Carnegie Mellon as a whole was not as
sociated with the rowdy nature of the 
crowds passing through Oakland and 
downtown. Instead, the campus main
tained control over events at and around 
Carnegie Mellon.
not have to see the demonstration on 
the campus. They were not in support of 
the message that the shantytown stood 
for and did not approve of the message 
being advertised at one of the campuss 
most visible locations.
However, all appropriate steps were 
taken for those associated with the shan
tytown to take control of the Fence, and 
we are proud that Carnegie Mellon stu
dents found a peaceful, productive, and 
sanctioned way to question the G20.
burghs reputation has risen in the eyes 
of many on the national and interna
tional stages.
Though it is unfortunate that the vio

in the news over the good work that the 
city was doing during the Summit, the 
important leaders that visited surely no
ticed and appreciated the work that was 
put into the Summit.
S. African education system 
in need of radical reforms
SABRINA PORTER
For South Africa to produce the worlds 
next generation of engineers or doctors, 
extreme reform is in order. In fact, change 
is needed if the country even hopes for 
over 50 percent of its elementary school 
population to pass the matric, the main 
nationwide test at each grade level.
Currently, the public education system 
is stuck in the apartheid legacy in which 
the Bantu system was established to 
make blacks subservient laborers. This 
system not only plagues the students but 
also hurts todays teachers, who were 
taught under the outdated system, mak
ing for a network of undereducated and 
unprepared South Africans.
Adding to the problem of outdated 
and repressive education, teacher ab
senteeism is at an all-time high. Teach
ers who fail to show up are not held ac
countable. Even when they do show up, 
they teach only for about half of the five 
hours they are expected to, spending the 
rest of the time immersed in paperwork. 
The knowledge they are imparting also 
brings up some doubts. In a study of lit
eracy in third grade teachers, the major
ity of them scored less than 50 percent on 
a test for sixth graders.
With South Africa hoping to become a 
new, competitive global power, it is time 
for its public education system to reach 
the level of these grand hopes.
The new government after apartheid 
made a number of changes that they 
claimed would bring the education sys
tem up to par. Many of these changes, 
however, have been disastrous. In chang
ing the curriculum, the government 
came up with a lesson plan far too so
phisticated for current teachers. Many 
teacher colleges were shut down, and no 
programs or reforms were established 
in their place. In this illogical move, the 
government ensured that the network 
of uneducated South Africans remain in 
the midst of this new education system. 
South Africa has one of the worlds high
est rates of teacher unionization. Howev
er, the emphasis is on teacher rights, not 
responsibilities, which needs to change.
Angie Motshekga, South Africas new
ly appointed Minister of Basic Education, 
has proposed some changes in the right 
direction. Motshekga has proposed that 
school principals be appointed directly 
by the education department, given more 
authority over teachers, and held ac
countable by the education department. 
She has also come up with a system of 
monitoring teacher attendance by having 
them respond to electronic queries.
However, Motshekga has shown that 
she is not willing to fully embrace radi
cal reform. She has already been labeled 
as giving in to the demands of the South 
African Democratic Teachers Union. And 
though this proposal was scrapped, lqv\fering the pass rate of the countrywide 
matric from an 80 percent to a 70 per
cent was at first seriously considered.
What is needed now in South Africa 
is a leader of education who is unafraid 
of complete departure from the apart
heid public education system. It is true 
that the education department does not 
have much money to work with, but mass 
amounts of capital are not needed for re
form. A change in mindset is needed in 
South Africa  a new age has dawned, 
and if South Africa aims to compete in 
the global economy, its reforms must be 
as determined as its hopes for change.

G20, riots provide excitement 
for students in Pittsburgh area
^ i I'ati
AKANKSHA VAIDYA
As I was walking through Oakland 
on Friday night, I was treated to some 
strange, or rather, stranger than usual 
sights. First were the boarded-up win
dows of many restaurants  evidence of 
the protests of the day before. A sign on 
the boarded-up windows of Pamelas Din
er caught my attention. It was a note to 
the protesters telling them that they had 
broken the windows of the only Mom 
and Pop restaurant on that block and 
that they had forgotten STARBUCKS.
As I laughed at the wit of the owners, I 
also wondered why the protesters had, in 
fact, targeted Pamelas. Pamelas, a local 
joint that started in Pittsburgh, seemed 
to have nothing to do with world poli
tics, global economics, or trade policy; in 
short, it had nothing to do with the G20.
What point were the protesters trying 
to get across by damaging restaurants 
like Pamelas? That they were angry? 
Ive tried looking for reasons of the pro
test since then and have found all sorts of 
answers. The protesters seemed to want 
a wide range of things: more jobs, fair 
trade, better educational policies, and no 
war, to name a few. It seems that these 
protesters took advantage of the fact that 
people from some big countries were 
meeting together and decided to vent 
their anger on basically anything and ev
erything that was bothering them.
The Summit seems to have ended suc
cessfully, with the leaders making the de
cisions that they had anticipated. What 
effect, then, did all these protests have?
Personally, I think that the only effect 
they seem to have had is to have stirred
up the Pittsburgh community. For the 
Average bogged-down-by-work, lookingfor-some-excitement college student (in
cluding me), the protests were a source 
of entertainment. I was working on a 
group assignment, and for the first time, 
instead of talking about classes, we were 
talking about how protesters were beat
en up by police downtown. I had never 
seen so many police cars around campus 
before; I was actually silly enough to run 
after the sound of sirens in the hope of 
catching a glimpse of some action.
I went to Oakland on Friday night on 
the pretext of having some ice cream, but 
was delighted when I saw a policeman in 
complete riot gear buying ice cream Tor 
a group of his colleagues sitting in a van 
outside Dave and Andys. I could have 
taken the bus back, but wanted to walk 
back so that I could see the news vans 
and the police, all in riot gear, lined up to 
face the oncoming assault. After getting 
back, I read live feeds on the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette about how the police had to 
use OC gas and smoke grenades in order 
to disperse the crowd of protesters. I was 
scared, yet excited, to think that I was 
there mere minutes ago.
The G20 Summit came right in the 
middle of the semester; just when we 
were getting caught up in some serious 
work. I believe that for many, it came as 
a nice break to the mundane college life. 
The protests seemed to add to this feeling 
of a nice break from the usual routine. I 
vaguely remember the G20 Summit be
ing about some climate and economic 
policy reforms, but for me, it was a fourday weekend, a nice time to sleep in, and 
a large amount of excitement.
Akanksha Vaidya fawaidya@J doesnt 
want to get back to work and wishes Pitts
burgh would have more G20 Summits.

CMU showcases 
commitment to 
global presence
Rotimi Abimbola & Adam Klein
Whether it was through panel 
discussions, guest lectures, or 
open discussion among peers, 
my hope is that Carnegie Mel
lon students now feel as if they 
were a part of the Summit. This 
university and its students have 
demonstrated their dedication to 
freedom of expression and open
ness to the sharing of different 
perspectives and ideas.
Moving forward this year, I 
hope the passing of the G20 has 
stressed the importance of Car
negie Mellons commitment to a 
global presence. Finding a way 
to connect students from each 
global campus and doing it in a 
manner that improves the day-today lives of students is a difficult 
problem. While Carnegie Mellon 
boasts campuses in Greece; Sili
con Valley; Qatar; Japan; Austra
lia; Portugal; Washington, D.C.; 
India; and South Korea, the Qatar 
campus is the only one besides 
Pittsburgh that is home to under
graduate students.
With this in mind, the social in
teraction between graduates and 
undergraduates becomes even 
more pivotal. The global commu
nity familiarity and international 
work experience that graduate 
students possess is incredibly 
valuable to undergraduates. Likewis^the Tartan culture  play 
hard, work harder  that is creat
ed by undergraduates is appreci
ated by graduate students. In the 
future, Timi and I, as your student ^ 
government leaders, expect to 
collaborate with various colleges 
on campus to facilitate more in
teraction between graduates and 
undergraduates. Reflecting back 
on the G20, it is my belief that the 
free exchange of ideas between 
graduates and undergraduates 
a social arena is just what our 
university needs to continue the 
trend of our global presence.
With our normal routine in 
mind, next Saturday, Oct. 3, the 
soccer team is playing at 11 a.m. 
inGesling Stadium. Beat Chi
cago! Free Ritas will be served, 
and any student who signs up for 
the Tartan Rewards Program will 
be entered into a raffle that in
cludes such prizes as a flat-screen 
HDTV, MP4 player, and various 
gift cards. Plus, after attending 
your third Tartan Reward event, 
you receive a free Tartan T-shirt. 
Also, next Saturday is the inaugu
ral night of the Loop Bus. The first 
pickup is at the University Center 
turnaround at 6:30 p.m. More in
formation and schedules will be 
available later this week at the UC

Leadership personalities: Leaders are like plants
Racism, discrimination still exist in Southern schools
CYNTHIA PENG__________
Leaders have been likened to 
many things. Most have been po
etic: The Bible says leaders are 
like those who move boundary 
stones, and some music nerd on 
the Internet says leaders are like 
maestros  something about 
reaching beyond the notes to 
reach the magic in the players.
Then there are the less elegant 
metaphors. German Chancellor 
Angela Merkel has been likened 
to a frumpy Hausfrau. French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy has 
been likened to a sex symbol, 
the 68th best-dressed person in 
the world, and even James Bond. 
George W. Bush has been likened 
to, well, an ape.
But with 20 of the most power
ful people in the world strolling 
into Phipps Conservatory last 
Thursday, it was only natural to 
liken leaders to plants. After all, it 
was 20 of the worlds most power
ful people in a super-green build
ing, with presumably 20 species 
of the worlds greenest plants. 
Everyone was most likely caught 
up in a big hubbub of power, pres
tige, personalities, and... plants.
Im no plant expert, but appar
ently some garden aficionados 
have a quiz you can take online 
called Find Which Plant Reveals 
the Real You, which will tell you 
how your personal style trans
lates into your plant personality. 
Ive always wanted to know! But 
this article isnt about me. Its 
about leaders. So I took the quiz 
for what I know about individual 
leaders of G20 economies. Since I 
regretfully do not know them on 
a personal level, I went off on a 
lot of presumptions and general
izations.
% HEATHER TOMKO__________
I remember going to my senior 
prom in high school: spending all 
day getting dolled up  doing my 
hair, my nails, my make up; put
ting on the dress I had spent (too 
many) hours picking out; taking 
millions of pictures with all of my 
friends until we saw flashes every 
time we blinked; dancing away at 
the Hilton downtown for hours. 
And then I think about what my 
night vyouldve been like if only 
somejpf my friends had been 
able to go with me, and I know it 
wouldnt have been nearly as fun 
as it was.
Unfortunately, that is the kind 
of prom that students in Mont
gomery County, Ga. experience. 
In this county, segregated proms 
have been held almost every year 
since 1971, when its schools were 
integrated, according to a New 
York Times article. The white stu
dents attend prom on one night, 
and the black students attend 
a different prom on a different 
night; while no black students 
are allowed at the white students 
prom, white students are invit
ed to the black students prom, 
though, according to the article, 
few actually show up.
It isnt only in Montgomery 
County where segregated proms 
are a tradition. Last year, Morgan 
Freeman offered to pay for the 
first-ever integrated prom in his 
hometown in Mississippi. While 
students were open to the idea, 
the parents were against it and, 
according to the Times, organized 
a competing private prom on the 
same night.
It is the parents who seem to be 
central to the continuation of the 
segregated prom in Montgomery 
County, as well. The prom is not 
planned by the school but rather 
by outside committees of stu
dents and parents. According to 
the article, it is not the students 
that would have a problem with 
an interracial promfriendships 
between black and white students 
are common  but rather, their 
parents.
Most of the students do want 
to have a prom together. But its 
the white parents who say no.... 
Theyre like, if youre going with 
the black people, Im not going to 
pay for it, said Terra Fountain, a 
graduate of Montgomery County 
High School, in the article.
Its hard to imagine that such 
blatant racism exists. And while 
the parents clearly are in the 
wrong in this situation  who 
goes against Morgan Freeman?  
I cannot place the blame fully on 
them; the schools administration
and students are also at fault.
The parents are the most vocal 
about their opinions  they are 
doing almost everything they can 
to ensure that an integrated prom 
doesnt happen, even if it means 
planning a rival prom on the 
same night. But this doesnt mean 
that they have ultimate control 
over the situation. Are they in 
the wrong? Absolutely. Are they 
teaching their children a poor set 
of values, and making themselves 
look bad in the process? Definite
ly. But are they the only ones that 
have a say? No.
The students that are attending 
these segregated proms are at the 
end of their teenage years, get
ting ready for their first taste of 
independence  college. There, 
they will no longer be able to rely 
on their parents to tell them how 
to think and act, and they will 
have to make their own decisions 
about what they believe. Theyre 
old enough to know right from 
wrong and to stand up for what 
they believe. This means that if 
they have friends of another race 
at school, they should be brave 
enough to want to spend time 
outside of school with them as 
well and share high school mile
stones like prom with them.
I fully believe that racism 
and discrimination is an impor
tant enough issue to risk going 
against ones parents wishes.
When I took the quiz for 
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio 
Hatoyama, I picked answers like 
Zen-like balance and minimal
ism and Japanese silver grass. 
When I took the quiz for Mexi
can President Felipe Calderon, 
I picked answers like Mexicaninspired crafts and a wreath 
of dried chili .peppers. Dream 
house question? Nicolas Sarkozy 
matches with Versailles while 
Gordon Brown matches with 
English cottage. The quiz lent 
itself to presumptions and gener
alizations a little too easily.
It was then time to buckle 
down and scour the Phipps web
site in my search for analogous 
truth. I found that Russian Presi
dent Dmitry Medvedev was most 
like a coneflower, which is a big, 
bold daisy that adds oomph to 
any garden. Medvedev isnt bad 
looking himself, and quite the 
character, too. As a youth, he 
made copies of Deep Purple re
cords, though they were on the 
state-issued blacklist. As a flower, 
the coneflower is purple. Tenu
ous connection? Well, ruminate 
on this: the coneflower attracts 
bees and butterflies, as does Med
vedev, as evidenced by his lovely 
wife, Svetlana Medvedeva.
Our German Hausfrau Angela 
Merkel is quite like the bottle
brush buckeye. Consistently not
ed for her spot on Forbes Most 
Powerful Women, Merkel com
pares incredibly well to the ex
ceptionally expansive suckering 
shrub. Meanwhile, Indian Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh, who 
as a boy studied by candlelight, 
can be compared to an azure 
sage, a perennial that can grow in 
poor soil conditions.
I got very excited when I came 
across an ugly carnivorous fly
trap, immediately assigning it to 
Kim Jong II. Then I realized that 
Kim Jong II, his unfashionable

gray pajamas, and his no-label 
sunglasses were nowhere near 
Pittsburgh. Kim Jong IPs invita
tion wasnt lost in the mail. It was 
never sent.
What about President Obama? 
No need to stretch our imagina
tions to find a plant for him. As 
of February, Dutch growers are 
developing a special chrysanthe
mum that is expected to sell 250 
million in the next three years. 
Those Dutch flower growers like 
to capitalize off American Presi
dents. The Reagan flower also 
sold well. Bush? Not so much.
Time also recently did a num
ber on the personalities of poli
ticians. It likened Australian 
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to 
having the attractiveness rating 
of a church mouse and suggested 
Manmohan Singhs speeches as 
a natural remedy for sleep disor
ders. My treatment of comparing 
leaders to plants is much kinder, 
especially when all the aforemen
tioned plants in this article are on
the Phipps Conservatory Top 10 
sustainable plant list for 2009.
Leadership? The ability of the 
plant to grow and encourage its 
fellow plants to thrive. Pittsburgh 
G20 Summit? All these sustain
able plants coming together, mi
nus the flytrap, to work toward 
sustainability, climate, and the 
environment.

junior science and humanities 
scholar.
Why havent any of the students 
refused to attend their respective 
proms, or why havent they in
vited all of their friends  black 
or white  to join them, regard
less of any rules their parents may 
have put in place regarding who 
is allowed to attend? The students 
here have a real chance to make a 
difference and to show their par
ents that their beliefs are wrong, 
but they ignore it for a night of 
dancing and partying with only a 
select group of their friends.
The administration, too, could 
have taken steps to combat the 
parents plans years ago by plan
ning a school-sponsored prom 
open to all students. The New York 
Times article mentions that Luke 
Smith, the principal of Montgomr 
ery County High School, said that 
there are no plans for a schoolsponsored prom in the future 
because at the last one, in 1995, 
attendance was poor.
But what Smith fails to realize 
is that one year is not enough of
Maria Raffaele/Assistant Art Editor
an effort to go against decades of 
tradition. Of course attendance 
was poor the first year; not only 
was it a huge change from the 
past, but its also likely that many 
of the students who likely would 
have attended 
not to by their parents.
The administration is not sup
porting racism, but they are also 
not taking a stand against it. By 
allowing the proms to continue, 
they are only supporting, al
though passively, the discrimina
tion the parents are espousing.
Perhaps if the administration 
and students both stood up for 
what is right, and a school-spon
sored prom were held for several 
years in a row, it could replace 
the tradition of segregated proms 
that currently exists, giving stu
dents the push they needed to go 
against their parents outdated 
beliefs.
Heather Tomko (Titomko@J would 
never go against Morgan Freeman.

Running to exercise? Quite the contrary
NADIR SAHIDA
Gluttony will collide with 
athleticism this weekend at 
Carnegie Mellons most ironic 
sporting event. The CMU Donut 
Dash, a fundraiser for the Chil
drens Hospital of Pittsburgh, is 
a combination competitive eat
ing contest and two-mile run 
that will be held at 10 a.m. on 
Saturday behind Hunt Library. 
The brothers of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon, the organizers of Do
nut Dash, are hopeful that this 
strange hybrid of endurance 
and appetite will help them 
raise their goal of $5000.
The rules of the race are sim
ple to understand but poten
tially nauseating. Competitors 
will be asked to run a mile from 
the library around campus to 
the UC turnaround. Krispy 
Kreme donuts will be distrib
uted at the turnaround for par
ticipants to quickly eat before 
finishing a grueling second 
mile down to Schenley Drive 
and back up Frew Street to the 
finish?
The events website specifi
cally addresses what many may 
consider the inevitable: We 
cant technically stop you from 
throwing up, but please dont 
make yourself throw up.
There are three ways for po
tential athletes to participate 
in the CMU Donut Dash: a com
petitor can either run in the In
dividual Challenge, in the Team 
Challenge as a group of three, 
or in the Casual Division. As 
an individual challenger, each 
person must eat a full dozen 
donuts, while in the team com
petition the 12 are spread out 
among the three competitors. 
Casual runners are welcome to 
eat as much or as little as theyd 
like, but they are not eligible 
to win. Each participant will 
receive a free T-shirt to com
memorate the event.
As of writing this article, 
there are already about 70 
participants stretching their 
quads and readying their elas
tic waistbands in anticipation 
of Saturday morning. Holly 
Hippensteel, Carnegie Mellons 
director of student life, will be 
on hand to eat the opening do
nut. After the races conclude, 
the brothers of SAE will have 
music, awards, and festivities 
for all participants.
The Greek community is ex
pected to have a strong show
ing. Im not going to ask some
one to do something I wouldnt 
do myself, said Paul Jasinto, 
assistant philanthropy chair
man for Sigma Alpha Epsilon. 
Im going to run with them, 
eat with them, and take that 
last miserable mile to the finish 
line.
In preparation for the Donut 
Dash, there will be a training 
session Wednesday from noon 
to 3 p.m. outside of Doherty 
Hall. Donuts will be given in 
return for donations and brave 
students can try their hand at 
quickly eating a donut and com
pleting a short sprint.
To sign up to run or help out 
for this event, students can visit 
the CMU Donut Dash website, 
cmudonutdash.com.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon has al
ready raised over $3600 for the 
Childrens Hospital and will 
accept donations and registra
tions until the day of the event.

Golf team takes second 6th place finish at Guy W. Kuhn Invitational
CASEY GARTH
* Staffwriter
Six seems to be the number for the 
Carnegie Mellon mens golf team, which 
finished sixth at the Guy W. Kuhn Invi
tational hosted at The Country Club of 
Meadville by Allegheny College, follow
ing their prior sixth place finish at the 
Lamkin Fall International.
The Tartans were led by sophomore 
Terrance Einhorn, who carded a two-day
total of 149 (73-76) and placed sixth in
dividually. As a team, the Tartans scored 
a 310 on Sunday followed by a 311 on 
Monday to finish the Invitational with a 
combined 621.
Division II California University of 
Pennsylvania led the 18-team field both 
days, finishing the 36-hole event just 26 
strokes over par with a 602. Taking sec
ond place and ending seven strokes back 
from the leader was fellow Division II 
school Clarion University. Daemen Col
lege finished third (610), followed by 
University of Rochester (615) in fourth, 
and St. Vincent (619) placed fifth.
Jared Schmader of Clarion was the 
individual leader, completing the twoday event even par with a 144 (71-73). 
Steve Fiori of St. Vincent, Zack Oyer of 
Muhlenberg, and Austin Stoddard of 
California University of Pennsylvania 
all finished tied for second, shooting just 
three over par.
Sophomore Michael Cheng helped the
Tartans to their sixth place finish with a 
141, shooting a 73 on Sunday and a 78 on 
Monday, finishing tied for 13th overall.
Seniors Christopher Lee and Brett Cannaday came in third and fourth for the 
Tartans, carding a 160 (83-77) and 162 
(82-80), respectively. First-year Charles 
Windon finished with a 167 (82-85) to 
round out the field for the Tartans.
While Einhorn has been the leading 
golfer for the Tartans this year, he is not 
completely satisfied. This past week
end, I really was in a great position to 
win the tournament but made a couple 
of uncharacteristic mental errors com
ing down the stretch, which cost me the 
tournament, Einhorn said. So, while 
Im happy with my game, I really want to 
try to keep it all together next week and 
get an even better result.
The Tartans will hit the links again 
Oct. 4-5 at the California (Pa.) Vulcan 
Invitational to be held at Cedarbrook 
Golf Course in Belle Vernon, Pa.
SPORTS COMMENTARY
Its all mental for us athletes
: ASHLEY HERRICK
As L sit at the International Tennis 
Association (ITA) Championships, I 
question the recipe for success on the 
tennis court. While I know that there 
are girls here-who spend plenty more 
hours practicing on the court, in the 
weight room, and getting match-play 
experience than their opponents, I 
see them losing in the first or second 
rounds. There is a distinctly common 
pattern among the players that fall 
early on: they lack mental toughness.
After the 5 a.m. wake-up this morn
ing and a several-hour rain delay, 
players everywhere are hungry, tired, 
worried about homework, irritated at 
waiting, and ready to go home. Though 
the fundamentals of practicing are cru
cial for competing at any high level of 
athletics, the mental toughness of an 
athlete is what really makes them suc
ceed. I assert that sports are 85 percent 
mental, 15 percent skill and prepara
tion.
Many people often feel a tightness of 
muscles when their mental side fails, 
causing them to move more slowly. 
They may feel butterflies and a fear 
of losing, or embarrassment, which 
drags down their performance.
It occurred to me that this problem 
is particularly prevalent and more dif
ficult to overcome in individual sports. 
When players are surrounded by team
mates who can loosen them up, replace 
them at their position, cheer for them 
on the sidelines, and cover for them, 
then their mental toughness can be 
weak and the team can still prevail. 
However, in an individual sport such as 
tennis or golf, players success depends 
solely on themselves.
As I look around at this tournament, 
I realize there are about 20 teams from 
various colleges and universities. How
ever, right now, there are only 12 girls 
competing on the six courts. Every 
court will have one winner and one 
loser, and during the next 90 minutes 
or so, all the attention of the 200-plus 
people gathered at the site will be on 
these 12 girls.
What separates the winners from the 
losers are the skills teammates need to 
keep their peers mentally tough and 
performing at their best. These boil 
down to four main skills: concentra
tion, control, confidence, and commit
ment. Concentration can be so easily 
interrupted by the slightest of events  
weather, delays, spectators, etc. These 
interruptions may cause athletes to 
miss crucial moments, which may de
termine the outcome of a competition, 
such as when a girl completely missed 
the ball while watching a point on an
other court.
Control refers to the athletes abil
ity to maintain his or her composure
on the court. I just watched -a match 
where a losing girl got angry, so She 
rushed every point and the match was 
instantly over. She still had a chance in 
the match, but her attitude pulled her 
far away from victory. She slammed 
the balls into the backdrop, hit them 
into the net, and screamed at the top 
of her lungs. Her behavior was not 
only embarrassing; it completely un
dermined her impressive tennis skills. 
Had she kept calm and stayed in con
trol of her emotions, she would have 
easily had a chance to change the path 
of the match.
Confidence is important to perform
ing at the highest level possible. De
spite any prior preparation that ath
letes may have done, if they dont have 
confidence in their personal or team 
ability to win, they will likely be un
successful.
Athletes often choke during games 
or matches. Since we .have such a large
team and many people play at once, 
my coach often makes me an assis
tant coach. When I sit on the courts 
and people walk up to me while they 
are panicking, they constantly report 
feeling that they are bad at tennis and 
cannot win. With this type of attitude, 
there is no chance for success.
Commitment is the diligence to stay 
focused on the task at hand. Instead 
of thinking about other relationships, 
homework, or events in life while on 
the court, the only thing that should 
matter is the sport. If athletes have 
problems in other aspects of their lives 
and that carries over into their athletic 
performances, they arent fully com
mitted to succeeding.
Ultimately, despite any preparation 
or skills an athlete has, if their mental 
toughness fails on the court, they will 
probably lose. There is more to a sport 
than force and athleticism, and who
ever is mentally the strongest will win.
Volleyball loses to Mount Union 3-1
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Co-editor
Last Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon volleyball team traveled 
to Alliance, Ohio to compete 
against Mount Union College 
but were unable to overcome the 
Purple Raiders tough defenses 
and dropped a 3-1 decision. The 
Purple Raiders move to 12-2 for 
the season while the Tartans shift 
to 9-5.
The Tartans started off strong, 
decisively -taking the first game 
25-13. The momentum began to 
change after the second game, 
where the Tartans narrowly lost 
25-22. The Purple Raiders pulled 
ahead and took the second game 
25-21 and held their defenses
tight to prevent the Tartans from 
taking the fourth game, winning 
it 25-18.
Defensively, Junior Cameron 
Griffin led the team with total 
digs, taking 24 for the match. 
Following Griffins example were 
sophomore Emily Baddock with 
10 kills and senior Cara Fatigati 
with eight kills.
On the offense side, seniors 
Jess Brackin, Megan Killeen, and 
Sam Carter led the Tartans and 
each contributed eight kills. Ju
nior Caroline Size added seven 
kills. Carter also had 34 assists 
against the Purple Raiders.
The Tartans hit the court 
Wednesday, when they travel to 
Beaver Falls, Pa. to play Geneva 
College.

The Carnegie Mellon football 
team is back in the winners circle 
as they defeated Hiram College 
with an overpowering 42-3 vic
tory last Saturday. The game took 
place in Hiram, Ohio, but that did 
not stop the Tartans from beating 
the Terriers for the seventh time 
in a row. With the win, the Tar
tans record moves to 3-1, while 
Hirams drops to 0-3.
First-year Jake Nardone in par
ticular had a breakthrough per
formance, scoring his first colle
giate touchdown and rushing for 
a career-high 97 yards. The Tar
tans opened up the scoring with 
7:12 to play in the second quarter 
when senior quarterback Phil 
Pantalone hit sophomore running 
back Chris Garcia with a 26-yard 
pass, who then broke two tackles 
en route to diving into the end 
zone for a 7-0 Tartans lead.
The Tartans scored their sec
ond goal 1:44 later when junior 
running back Justin Pratt scored 
on a 5-yard run, bringing the 
score to 14-0 two plays after ju
nior Tom Todd blocked a Hiram 
punt at the 12-yard line. Carn
egie Mellon scored once more in
the quarter when Nardone ended 
a 44-yard drive with a 1-yard 
touchdown run, giving the Tar
tans a commanding 21-0 lead 
going into halftime.
Pratt scored another touch
down on a 12-yard run with 18 
seconds remaining in the third 
quarter to cap a 67-yard drive. 
The Tartans then raised the 
score to 35-0, when first-year 
Dave Birsen made an 11-yard 
run to the end zone. With 5:48 
remaining in the game, the Ter
riers finally broke the Tartans 
shutout with a 22-yard field goal. 
The momentum was short-lived, 
though, as Birsen scored another 
touchdown five minutes later to 
cap the scoring at 42-3.
Beating Hiram was a great 
way to get back on track after a 
tough loss last week against Ho
bart, senior captain Brendan 
Howe said. Our offense moved 
the ball very well and our defense 
did a great job holding them to 
only three points. Its obvious 
weve been getting better every 
week and we look to continue our 
success next week at Kenyon.
The Tartans will look to carry 
this momentum into their next

keeper to put the Tartans up 1-0. 
Six minutes later, Griffin used his 
speed on a breakaway to bury the 
ball in the left corner of the goal.
In the second half, Griffin 
came out hungry for more as he 
scored three more goals within 
the first eight minutes of the half. 
His third goal of the day, and 
second unassisted, was scored 
off a 15-yard blast into the upper 
right corner. Shortly thereafter, 
Griffin took an assist from senior 
Ryan Browne to score his fourth 
of the day. Three and a half min
utes later, Griffin netted perhaps 
his most brilliant goal of the day 
as he scored off a beautiful diving 
header. Sophomore Kyle Young 
topped off the scoring in the 76th 
minute, making his first goal of 
his collegiate career.
The onslaught continued on 
Saturday as the Tartans downed 
Grove City College in a rainsoaked home fixture. The team 
maintained possession through
out the vast majority of the first 
half, but initially had trouble 
getting on the score sheet. Soph
omore Brad Edelman looked 
dangerous early on as he contin
uously put pressure on the Grove 
City back line, but was unable to 
take advantage of a few opportu
nities.
The team was also hampered 
by two offside calls before finally 
scoring in the 36th minute on 
yet another goal by Griffin. The 
weather conditions worsened 
after the half as the rain and 
wind picked up, but the Tartans 
played on unaffected. The goals 
came easy for seniors Pat Lutz, 
Ryan Heuler, and Griffin, as each 
scored in the second half within 
a 10-minute period to put the 
Tartans up 4-0. Senior Jon Hall 
then joined the parade with his 
first goal of the season to seal the 
5-0 victory. SenioY goalie Maks 
Khurgin continued his excellent 
play as he posted his sixth shut
out of the year.
The Tartans next match will 
be at home against the Bison of 
Bethany College this Tuesday, 
Sept. 29 at 7:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon mens soc
cer team recorded their sixth and 
seventh consecutive wins this 
week after shutting out both St. 
Vincent College (6-0) and Grove 
City College (5-0). In the span 
of two games, the team scored a 
whopping 11 goals against their 
opponents and allowed none in 
goal. The wins put the Tartans at 
8-1 for the season and will most 
likely push them down in the 
NSCAA/Adidas Division III rank
ings in the upcoming week. The 
team is currently ranked number 
12.
Perhaps the most incredible 
feat of the week came from se
nior forward Ricky Griffin, who 
scored a record of five goals in 
one game against St. Vincent last 
Wednesday afternoon.The goalfest began in the 20th minute of 
the match, when Griffin received

The Carnegie Mellon womens soccer team re
versed their recent bad fortunes with two victories 
this past week. The team first pulled out a 1-0 nailbiter over Allegheny College on Wednesday before 
asserting themselves in a 2-0 win over John Car
roll University on Saturday. The victories improved 
the Tartans record to 3-4 on the season and give 
the team some momentum following a three-game 
losing streak.
The victory over Allegheny was not just the end 
of Carnegie Mellons losing streak; the 1-0 victory 
in regulation also broke a streak of four straight 
overtime matches between the two teams. The 
games only goal came when sophomore Nicole 
Bayley broke through the Gators defense in the 
59th minute, taking a pass from junior Alice May

the goal. The goal was Bayleys first of the season. 
Alleghenys only threat came in the 38th minute 
of a scoreless first half, when Gator Abby Silves
ters shot was saved by Tartans junior keeper Anya 
Rosen. The Tartans defense shined, making sure 
that Silvesters kick was Alleghenys only shot on 
goal all game. Rosen was huge for the Tartans, 
playing a steadfast, scoreless game to allow for. 
Bayleys goal to stand up for the victory.
On Saturday, Rosen earned another shutout win 
as the Tartans defense shined once more, this time 
allowing John Carroll no shots on goal. In the first 
period, junior Emily Overstreet and sophomore 
Elsa Wu each took shots that were blocked by the 
Blue Streaks defense while senior Casey Garths 
shot in the sixth minute was saved by John Carroll 
keeper Molly Gradowski.

ATHLETE PROFILE: J.P. Allera
SARA WINGEN
Staffwriter
For most athletes, sports like cross country seem 
more like punishment than fun, but the Tartans 
prove that success can be found in these grueling 
races. J.P. Allera is an example of this success, hav
ing recently been named University Athletic Asso
ciation (UAA) Mens Cross Country Athlete of the 
Week. As a junior at Carnegie Mellon, Allera looks 
to be harnessing what he calls Pittsburghs active 
atmosphere in his efforts, consistently appearing 
in the top 10 at the finish line. Allera is a native of 
Columbia, Md., and while he enjoys the city scenery 
for college, his hometown is not so limited when it 
comes to strategic running routes.
Allera, majoring in chemistry and chemical en
gineering, said his most memorable class is organic 
chemistry. He credits his professor, Bruce Armitage, for maintaining the students interest during 
the early 8:30 a.m. hour. Allera decided to complete
v *
his second major in chemistry because he enjoys 
the science and engineering facets of the subject. 
When hes not studying or running through the 
woods of a cross country course, Allera maintains 
musical interests by playing the saxophone and 
teaching himself the harmonica.
Allera played soccer growing up before reaching 
high school, but he was really inspired to pursue 
cross country by his pastor, who also happened to 
be his high school coach. A past cross country great 
himself, Alleras coach was a mentor and a factor 
in Alleras present achievements. Allera hopes that 
his personal and team goals, such as reaching the 
top four at the conference meet, can be attained 
this season. He keeps a positive disposition, saying 
I never go into a race with the mindset that some
one is going to beat me, so when I toe the line, I 
concede nothing to anybody. With an attitude like 
that, its no wonder that Allera has been able to per
form at top level, and he will be able to continue to 
persevere to make sure his goals are met.

Eat, Pray, Love inspires all Everything you need to know
Gilbert writes about her journey searching for meaning About finding true love online or in the classroom
Eat, Pray, Love is the memoir of Elizabeth Gilbert, 
who travels across Italy, India, and Indonesia to 
pursue pleasure, devotion, and a balance of the 
two.
After her divorce, Gilbert decides to discover 
what she really wants in life and goes on a 
personal journey across nations to find her 
balance. She tells the truth" through 108 tales, 
distributed equally among all three countries, 
and she has the same number of stories as the 
numbers of beads of the japa mala. Japa malas, 
literally meaning prayer necklaces, are strings of 
108 beads used by Hindu and Buddhist monks to 
-repeat a mantra on every bead.
Concentrating on her spiritual journey through 
this mala, Gilbert first takes us to Italy. There, 
she spends four months, learning Italian and 
eating gelato for breakfast in Rome and pizza in 
Naples. During her time in Italy, she rediscovers 
what pleasure means. Making new friends and 
learning the Italian way of living, she explores 
the meaning of the word pleasure and what it 
means to enjoy life. Truly in love with Rome, she 
tries to understand if Rome is where she belongs. 
Her friend Guilo tells her how the secret to 
understanding a city and its people is to learn
 what is the word on the street? While for 
Rome the word may be sex and for the Vatican 
power," Gilbert tries to find out the word that 
describes her. At the end of her time in Italy, she 
decides to attaveisaie, meaning cross over, to her 
next country.
Trading worldly pleasures for an austere life, 
Gilbert then heads to an ashram in India. She 
tries to get used to a simple life of doing seva, or 
social service, and performing meditation. During 
her time in India, she describes her struggles 
with meditation and leading an austere life and 
how she manages to find her divine connection. 
At the ashram, Gilbert meets Richard from Texas, 
who nicknames her Groceries and guides her 
through her internal struggles. Any reader who 
has ever tried meditating on a regular basis may 
have encountered struggles like Gilbert did, and 
her having achieved a state of meditation gives 
hope to all the readers that they can achieve it 
too.
To combine the lives of pleasure and devotion 
and find a life of balance between the two, 
Gilbert's final destination is Bali in Indonesia. She 
meets the medicine man, Ketut Liyer, and lives 
in Bali for the next four months improving his 
English and learning more about his practices. 
She also meets Wayan, a Balinese healer and a 
single mother, and becomes good friends with 
her. Growing close to her, she raises funds to help 
build a permanent house for Wayan and learns 
how things work differently in Bali, especially
when one is a foreigner. She also meets Felipe, 
a Brazilian jeweler living in Bali. She comes to 
terms with love in Bali, where she starts dating 
Felipe, whom she later marries. At the end of 
her year-long journey, Gilbert learns more about 
herself and decides to attaveisaie into her new 
found life.
Last Monday, Gilbert kicked off this years Drue 
Heinz lecture series at the Carnegie Music Hall. 
Gilbert was recently in Rome for the filming of 
the movie Eat, Piay, Love starring Julia Roberts 
and Javier Bardem. She read an introduction to 
her forthcoming book Committed, which is about 
how she came to terms with marriage, especially 
after her first unsuccessful one.
Answering questions from her admirers, she gave 
advice to budding writers and mentioned how 
she has no trouble telling the truth about her 
life. She mentioned that even though people think 
that she has achieved a perfect life, nobodys life 
is perfect every day. Each day is a new struggle 
to make it the ideal day. Lastly, she closed her 
talk by telling us all how we should try to live our 
dreams, one step at a time. It may not happen 
overnight, but if we keep working toward our 
goals, we will achieve them.
Eat, Pray, Love is the true life story of a 
womans international quest to find herself.
Eat, Piay, Love is every persons journey and 
what each of us decides to do with it. It truly 
is, as the cover says, one womans search for 
everything across Italy, India, and Indonesia." The 
book is about asking yourself the right questions 
for discovering your own life. It is a memoir and 
a travelogue  have an inward odyssey while 
traveling the world with Gilbert.

Dear Rohit,
What do you think about online 
dating? My real life experience 
hasnt been all too great Its so 
much easier online, and you can 
learn whether somebody would 
be compatible with you even 
before meeting them. Whats 
your say?
 Online Dating Devotee 
Dear ODD,
Ive experimented with online dating 
myself {have you tried match.com?) 
and it definitely has its pros and 
cons. Sure, it seems like you can 
get some idea of your compatibility 
with a person before meeting them, 
but that doesnt mean it will turn out 
the way you think.
You might have a lot in common 
with somebody who turns out to 
be an ultra-weird mustache-fetishist 
pediatrician (unless youre into that, 
in which case, thats... great for you) 
or somebody who turns out to be 
a 500-pound middle-aged guy 
named Mike instead of a 19-year-old 
blonde. Besides, you always have 
to factor in the chance that your 
blind date will kill you  always take 
your first dates to well-lit, crowded 
places or take along a burly friend. 
With all that said, online dating can 
be a great way to build up your 
confidence, and you might  just 
might  actually meet somebody 
that you would be happy with.
So, I would say keep it up, but be 
really careful. A much easier and 
successful way, though, according 
to me, would be to join a new club, 
take up a new sport, or volunteer 
somewhere; trying something new 
is a great way to meet new people, 
not to mention a great way to learn 
about yourself. Oh, and one more 
thing: If you find a site that is really 
good, send me an e-mail!
Dating is reality,
 Rohit

Dear Rohit,
I have a huge crush on the TA 
for a course I am taking this 
semester. Every time I am in 
recitation, I have very naughty 
thoughts. I have spoken to him 
quite a bit after class - course 
material only, mind you. Should I 
ask him out yet?
 I Love Recitation 
Dear Recitation,
Thats messy, but not something 
I cant help you handle. Look on 
the bright side: At least youre 
not thinking about romancing a 
professor. A TA, on the other hand, 
is so much more within your reach. 
You dont always have to meet him 
in a classroom setting; you can try 
and run into him somewhere else 
on campus and then you would be 
more like peers than teacher and 
student.
But hold on just a minute. The 
semester is only four months long. 
When hes no longer your TA, there 
is no harm in the two of you dating. 
But if you ask him out right now, it 
could mean a lot of trouble (issues 
with partiality and whatnot). If you 
really like him, then hes worth the 
wait. If not, then look in the mirror 
and ask yourself: Are you excited by 
him or by the teacher-student fling 
idea? Meanwhile, hit those books 
hard to impress him.
The wait is worth it,
 Rohit

Tales from abroad: Brazil
Experience the diversity of this South American countrys population, music, and culture
"Bern Vindoa Sao Paulo" read the nine-foot sign at the 
baggage claim. Twelve hours, two planes, a 30-minute train 
ride, and a three-hour long drive later, I had finally reached my 
destination: the immense city of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
I rushed out of baggage claim only to find that the study 
abroad program coordinators had left the airport, as I had 
arrived after the scheduled pick up time. Immediately, Thiago, 
my new Brazilian friend from the plane, offered to take me to 
my final destination.
There I was, on my way to the hotel with Thiagos mother, 
father, sister, and niece. They greeted me as if they had 
known me their whole lives, took me to lunch, and dropped 
me off at my hotel, and Thiago's mother went in with me to 
ensure that nothing was out of order with my reservation.
They gave me all their contact information and insisted that 
I call them if I needed anything. That was my first glimpse of 
the welcoming, cheerful nature of Brazilian culture.
Generally, a persons physical appearance can provide 
some insight into what their ethnic background may be.
For Brazilians, this does not apply. Brazil is a melting pot of 
cultures, ethnicities, and languages.
Brazilians are Brazilians, whether they 
are from Rio Grande do Sul with 
Germanic and Polish roots, from 
Salvador da Bahia with a 
distinct African heritage, 
or from an Indian tribal 
village in the centralwest region of the 
country.
Brazil also houses the largest Japanese population in the 
world  after Japan, of course. Each region has its own 
culture; music and colloquial language are very much 
influenced by their ethnic roots and many times differ 
drastically from one another. Brazilian music captures the 
nature of this diversity very clearly.
The smooth, jazz-like sounds of bossa nova, the pop-like songs 
of Musics Popular Brasileira (MBP), the very inappropriate 
lyrics of baile funky, the country-like songs of sertanejo, and, 
my personal favorite, the samba with its lively African beats, 
all contribute to the mosaic diversity that characterizes 
Brazilian music.
With regard to my educational experience, I would not change 
a thing  besides my morning class at 7 a.m., that is. I study 
at a university called Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV), and our 
classes are quite rigorous with the standard of education on 
par with that of Carnegie Mellon. Much of the work is group 
based  which can be a setback considering the very relaxed 
attitudes of many Brazilian students.
Brazilians are great hosts; hence, a group meeting for a 
project easily turns into a few beers, great food, and a good 
selection of Brazilian music. Besides school, I also work as a 
research analyst for the Center of Finance and Private Equity 
at my university, which is an experience I value very much 
considering FGV is a highly regarded business school in Latin 
America. I enjoy my academic curriculum here and absolutely 
love my job; I feel like I am learning so much so quickly.
I have enjoyed Sao Paulo very much. Its an immense city with 
so much to do  including an incredible night life  and I 
have made an amazing group of friends with whom I share it 
all. However, my heart belongs to the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 
all my life, I have never experienced something as incredible 
as the first weekend I spent in Rio. Im almost hesitant 
to put my experience in writing because I dont 
think my writing will do the city justice.
We arrived at Rio on a Thursday night, and as we were 
driving into the city, the first visible sight was the image of 
the famous Cristo Rendedor, a 100-foot high statue of Jesus 
Christ (pictured below). The Christ stands almost mystically 
on the very tip of the mountain, and clouds surround its base, 
giving the appearance of its being suspended in the air.
The first thing that came to mind was disbelief that I was 
actually here. The lively, fiesta-like, very laid back culture of 
cariocas is uplifting  it makes me smile. The world-famous 
beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana are a sight to see.
The views from different parts of the city are incredible. 
Theres samba in the streets of Lapa, where much of the 
nightlife happens, every night until 6 in the morning.
My friends and I walked into a bar where a group of musicians 
were playing at a single table with hundreds of people 
surrounding them, dancing to their hearts content. We 
danced along with them, with absolutely no idea how to 
properlyexecute their signature dance moves, but I think we 
did a fairly good job  if I do say so myself.
With my broken Portuguese and mediocre samba skills, I am 
immersing myself fully in the Brazilian culture and loving 
every minute of it. I would say to any student considering 
studying abroad that it's important you do. It is part of your 
education, because what you learn about the world, the 
nature of people, and most importantly yourself is invaluable.

Tragedies, comedies, and musicals
Bring some drama into your life with this seasons performances
The School of Drama and Carnegie Mellons studentrun theater group ScotchnSoda offer a menu of 
performances this fall semester that will appease every 
theatrical appetite.
The School of Drama kicks off their theatrical season 
with The Grapes of Wrath, playing Oct. 1-10, with 
performances Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
a matinee performance on Saturday at 2 p.m. Adapted 
by Frank Galatic from the novel by John Steinbeck, the 
play follows a family of sharecroppers, the Joads, as 
they travel across America searching for a better life in 
the years following the Great Depression. Winner of the 
Tony Award for Best Play in 1990, The Grapes of Wrath 
holds particular relevance in todays economic climate.
Maria Raffaele I Assistant Art Editor
On the other side of the spectrum is a satire of the 
white-collared corporate world: The musical How to 
Succeed in Business Without Really Trying will open 
Nov. 12 and run through Nov. 21. With music and 
lyrics by Frank Loesser and based on the book by 
Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock, and Willie Gilber, this 
musical satire of the business world will be directed by 
Broadway import Daniel Goldstein. Goldstein comes to 
Pittsburgh after having worked as associate director for 
the Broadway musical All Shook Up, a musical revolving 
around the songs of Elvis Presley. The Broadway 
production ran from September 2004 through March
2005. How to Succeed premiered in 1961 and ran for 
four years, picking up seven Tony Awards and a Pulitzer 
Prize for Drama. The musical was revived in 1995 with 
leads played by Matthew Broderick and Megan Mullally.
The Scotchn'Soda theater group will be putting on a 
musical adaptation of Charles Dickens last, unfinished 
mystery novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, over 
Halloween weekend (which is also Homecoming
weekend). As it is a "participatory production, the 
audience is asked to vote for the ending they wish to 
see performed at the end of each show. Student director 
and senior music major Scott Wasserman brings British 
humor and murder mystery to life in a production that 
features actors from all departments of the university. 
Even if musical theater isn't your thing, youll love 
the high energy, humor, and audience participation in 
Drood," Wasserman said.
The School of Dramas Three Days of Rain by Richard 
Greenberg is a surreal, three-act play that delves into 
the impact of relationships, with both short-term and 
lifelong repercussions. This play received widespread 
(mostly negative) press during its production on 
Broadway, which starred television and film actors Julia 
Roberts, Bradley Cooper, and Paul Rudd, who were 
criticized for not delivering the presence or range in 
acting necessary for this play to succeed. However,
Three Days of Rain, which has since been performed 
in London's West End (with the title character played 
by Atonement's hunky James McAvoy) is a thoughtprovoking, fast-paced piece that requires the audience 
to ask questions of themselves as much as Greenberg 
asks them of his tormented characters. The play will 
only be performed for a limited time, Oct. 28-30, and 
should not be missed.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned: Medea by 
Euripides is another short-running play which will be 
put on Dec. 2-5. The plot revolves around the revenge 
of a woman who has been betrayed by her husband. 
Another Greek tragedy, Burial at Thebes, opens on Nov.
11 and runs until Nov. 13. This is Seamus Heaney's 
new translation of Sophocles Antigone and explains 
Antigone's punishment  being walled up inside a cave
 after she defies the king of Creon in protecting the 
dignity of her brother.
Looking forward into the spring semester, the School of 
Drama has planned the following productions:
The Winter Festival of New Plays, premiering new works 
by Carnegie Mellon dramatic writing students. Jan. 
29-Feb. 27.
Dead Mans Cell Phone by Sarah Ruhl. Feb. 10-12.
In The Blood by Suzan-Lori Parks. Feb. 16-24.
The Inspector General by Nikolai Gogol (a new 
adaptation by Michael M. Chemers). Feb. 18-27.
Slow Dance on the Killing Ground by William Hanley. 
March 17-19.

On understanding changes
Youll have to forgive me if I dont feel like writing about music today. 
Its a cold and rainy Saturday morning, about the usual I would expect 
from a Pittsburgh fall, but in light of the past few days events, I cant 
help but feel uneasy. Sure, theres been that overwhelming sense of 
doom since all the helicopters, barricades, and less lethal weaponry 
started arriving, but now its that calm period, that waiting to see when 
its all going to be over and we can have our city back. A little while 
ago, I was reading David Foster Wallaces essay published in the 
early 90s about the then-new David Lynch film Lost Highway. As he 
discusses various reasons why this film is (going to be) awesome, he 
mentions an aspect of why Lynchs films are also really unpleasant to 
watch. "We need to believe, he writes, that our own hideousness 
and darknesses are secret.
Weve all had that experience reading a book or watching a movie and 
suddenly its over and you feel absolutely miserable and hopeless about 
this whole being a human business. I had this reaction most strongly 
while watching the latest Batman installment, The Dark Knight. I saw 
this movie three times in the theater, and unlike other movies where 
once you know how it ends you become less responsive, I became 
increasingly more upset each time I saw it. Part of what was frustrating 
about this experience was not being able to put my finger on what 
exactly it was that troubled me so much. A good friend of mine went 
with me every time to see the movie and had a similar reaction. For 
months, neither of us could figure out what it was about The Dark 
Knight that was so upsetting. At different points along the way, we 
made small progresses  something about the capacity and affinity in 
all of us to be violent and destructive, the mirror between Batman and 
the role of the United States, the idea of there being nowhere safe and 
no one to trust  but for the most part, the only thing we were ever 
really certain of was that the movie seemed to pull something together 
for us, even though we werent sure what that thing was.
So all week Ive been thinking about The Dark Knight, and I have that 
same feeling I did each time I left the theater, taking the long road 
home, lying in bed and thinking about how quickly everything can be 
turned on its head. We know that something big has happened; that 
something has been set into motion that cannot be taken back. And 
maybe Im being melodramatic about this; maybe by the time you 
are reading this Monday morning, Pittsburgh will have returned to its 
regularly scheduled programming. But my guess is that somethings 
changed, even if, like The Dark Knight, its going to take me a while to 
realize what exactly that means.

Pittsburgh Opera brings Russian tragedy to life
Actors and orchestra put on a spectacular performance of Eugene Onegin to audiences delight
From the first note played by the orchestra to the last 
emotional chords sung by Onegin and Tatiana, the Pittsburgh 
Operas presentation of Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin last 
Saturday was a huge success.
Tchaikovskys opera, first performed in 1879, is based on 
Alexander Pushkins novel, written in verse, of the same 
name. Much of the verse sung in the opera is taken directly 
from the novel, and the entire opera is sung in Russian.
Tatiana (Anna Samuil) and Olga (Lindsay Ammann) are 
sisters, and are two of the main characters. Olga is in love 
with their neighbor, Lensky (Raymond Very), who brings a 
friend and neighbor, Eugene Onegin (Dwayne Croft), to their 
house to visit.
Tatiana immediately falls in love with Onegin, only to be 
rejected by him after sending him a letter. Despite the fact 
that Onegin and Lensky are friends, they quarrel in the 
second act and ultimately fight a duel. In the third act, Onegin 
realizes that he is in love with Tatiana, only to find that she 
has married his older cousin and is no longer available for him.
All of the cast members were wonderful performers with 
powerful voices. In each scene, the characters' emotions 
showed both through the tone and volume of singing and 
through physical actions, and each note sung contained 
meaning and emotion.
When Tatiana is thinking about writing to Onegin, her 
excitement, anxiety, and worry show through her actions. She 
often looks at herself in a mirror, and when she sings that she 
is ashamed, her voice transmits her emotion, and one cannot 
help but sympathize with her.
This scene was also particularly interesting because it took 
place in Tatianas bedroom. The way that this was portrayed 
was to have a room seemingly floating above the stage.
The space around it was unused, and it was clear that her 
bedroom was on the second floor of the house, which looked 
almost like a dollhouse.
Doors led to balconies and out of the room, and when Tatiana 
observed that it was morning and she had not slept, sunshine 
(or what looked very much like it inside of the theater, 
anyway) crept in through her window and her outside door.
After Tatianas old nursemaid, Filipyevna (Susan Shafer), 
agrees to have someone deliver the letter, the scene changes, 
.and the room disappears to give way to woods and peasant 
women picking berries. The women sing of how they will pelt 
men with berries and then leave the stage for Tatiana.
Tatiana is frantic, and the worry and regret over sending 
the letter show in her singing, her breathing, and her frantic 
movements around the stage. When Onegin comes into the 
forest, he pulls the letter out of his coat pocket and not-sosensitively informs her that its no use pretending she didnt 
write it.
After Tatiana sits on a bench  her face distraught, her 
breathing heavier and shakier  Onegin tells her to be more 
careful next time; other men might be less kind to her about 
it than he was. Tatiana is crushed, and the act ends with her 
sitting alone on the stage.

The next act focuses on Onegin and Lensky, but perhaps 
the most entertaining character is Monsieur Triquet (Joseph 
Frank). Triquet is French and is visiting a friend in Russia. He 
sings a song to Tatiana with lyrics so amusing to the crowd 
that Olga audibly laughs in the middle of a verse. The party 
guests applaud him when he stops, but once they stop, he 
starts again.
It is at this same party that Lensky and Onegin agree to duel, 
resulting from jealousy and conflict over Olga.
The duel is regarded as one of the most important points of 
both the opera and the novel. It is a powerful scene in which 
two friends must fight because of a rash decision made at a 
party. It results in the death of Lensky, who feels that he has 
lost everything anyway, having told Olga the night before, 
farewell... forever.-
The end of the opera takes place in a palace in St. Petersburg, 
and Tatiana is shown as a changed woman. Now married to 
Prince Gremin (Oren Gradus), she is no longer the country girl 
she used to be. In earlier scenes, her hair was worn down and 
her dresses were usually white and simple.

Onegin explains to an embarassed Tatiana that he cannot 
reciprocate her love.
different from before. Onegin attends the ball and sees her, 
deciding that he is in love with her.
Perhaps the most entertaining part of this scene is when 
Onegin realizes that he loves Tatiana. His enthusiasm is 
comical, and his facial expression is like that of a child.
His grin takes over his face, and he looks toward the ceiling, 
hands clasped under his chin. This, coming from a character 
that is very stoic through the rest of the opera, was surprising 
and showed a marked change in Onegin.
The final scene takes place in a private room in the palace 
with Tatiana and Onegin. He begs her to leave her husband 
for him, and she refuses, even after admitting that she still 
loves him. She bids him farewell forever and leaves the stage. 
Onegin, crushed and kneeling on the floor hunched over, is 
the last image shown in the opera.
While the singing, set, and costumes were all very important 
to bringing out the emotion and meaning in the show, it 
would be wrong to leave out the influence and importance of 
the orchestra.
Conducted by Antony Walker, the music provided the perfect 
backdrop for all of the events. The intensity or calmness of 
the music drove the emotional feeling even in large scenes, 
and Walker's animated movements contributed to the feelings 
evoked by the opera as a whole.
This tragic story of friends and lovers who must be parted 
was a huge success on the stage, with shouts of bravo" 
coming from the audience at the end of nearly every song. All 
of the emotions transmitted through the singing of the very 
talented cast contributed to a highly successful rendition of 
Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin.

Aliens and humans battle it out in District 9
Blomkamp and Jackson put together a riveting science fiction flick based on a historical short film
Director Neill Blomkamp and producer Peter Jackson team 
up in this falls new science fiction film District 9. This 
movie is based on the short film Alive in Joburg, released 
in 2005, which deals with the issues of social segregation, 
xenophobia, and racism (in the form of speciesism) between 
humans and aliens. The movies title and plot were inspired 
by the events that took place in South Africa during the 
apartheid regime in 1966 in a place called District Six in Cape 
Town. During that time, 60,000 people were forcibly removed 
from District Six, and the area was declared as "whites only 
by the government.
The film begins in Johannesburg, South Africa as a 
.documentary type film and has interviews from all 
departments of Multinational United (MNU), a private military 
contractor, in which people describe the situation they were 
in. An alien spaceship had stopped over this city in 1982 
and was stranded due to tne loss of its command module. 
When the malnourished aliens, or "prawns as they are called, 
are found, they are placed in District 9, separate from the 
humans.
This place soon becomes a slum and a breeding ground for 
illegal activities, such as black market weapon sales and 
prostitution. Wikus can der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an MNU 
field operative, is assigned to lead the relocation of the aliens 
to District 10, farther away from the angry citizens. During
the relocation, Wikus raids one of the aliens houses and he 
discovers a small canister containing a drop of chemical 
liquid that he accidentally sprays onto his face, after which he 
passes out and is taken t'o the hospital. The doctor discovers 
that Wikus left forearm has mutated into an alien appendage 
and Wikus is immediately isolated by MNU. The MNU team 
realizes now that Wikus had mutated DNA in his alien hand 
he can operate the alien weapons that humans werent able 
to utilize.
In a panic, Wikus escapes from MNU as a fugitive and takes 
residence in the one place he knew they wouldnt look for him
 District 9. There, he once again meets the alien whom he 
had taken the canister from. The alien sees Wikus' physique 
and immediately realizes what has happened. The alien 
explains that the canister contains just enough liquid for him 
to fly to the mother ship and leave the planet. According to 
the alien, the mother ship has medical equipment that would 
transform Wikus back to his human form, so Wikus and the 
alien decide to invade MNU in order to retrieve the canister. 
But, in order to do so, they will need some alien weaponry, 
and Wikus goes to the black market to obtain some.
At the black market, Wikus runs into some trouble when 
the leader of a gang captures Wikus and tries to cut his arm 
off. Wikus, however, grabs an alien weapon, overpowers his 
captors, and escapes with some weapons. Upon breaking into
MNU offices, Wikus finds the canister while the alien mourns 
his fallen friend, whom, the alien realizes, has been subjected 
to medical experiments by MNU.
After returning to District 9 with the canister, the alien 
decides that he wants to go to his home planet and seek help 
for his people before curing Wikus. However, the alien told 
Wikus that this would take three years and promised to come 
back for Wikus. In a whirl of anger and frustration, Wikus 
knocks the alien out and, with the help of the aliens son, 
powers up the command module only to be shot down soon 
afterward by MNU. Wikus and the alien are captured by MNU, 
and the movie takes some interesting plot twists and leaves 
the audience curious about their fate.
This film really keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. 
The movie, with its documentary style filming, makes the film 
seem rather realistic. It also portrays an important message 
about the world's police and how they respond to situations 
like segregation and racism. Wikus is a character that is 
confusing because he doesnt seem like an antagonist, nor 
does he seem like a protagonist, so the audience can decide 
whether to cheer or boo this main character. District 9 is a film 
that will keep you interested and definitely make you think.

The highest-grossing R-rated movie 
in history is coming to campus. What

plenty of nudity (male and female, of 
course), expletives, babies, tigers, 
tasers, boozing, Mike Tyson, etc.
Not to mention the hilarious Zach 
Galifianakis in his first major film role. 
The plot seems simple enough: some 
guys bachelor party goes out of 
control and we see the repercussions. 
But there's so much more to The 
Hangover than that  namely, a 
magnificent script and'cast to go with 
hilarious one-liners. See the movie and

us back to 1962, where a new kid in 
the neighborhood is just trying to fit in

Political activism and free expression take ov
Students protest the G20 by building a shantytown made up of different pieces of artwork that sp

created a shelter for ourselves, very literally, but also a politico 
shelter where we can foster ideas safely.
Those involved with the CMU G20 Arts Base know that not 
everybody has understood their metaphor. The idea of a 
shanty is so foreign for this atmosphere; just the juxtapositior 
of that image, I feel, has been really powerful for those who 
realize it is a shanty and associate it to shelter, said Ramos. 
A lot of people can't even make that foreign association 
because were so privileged. I think that end of it has been ar 
interesting message about poverty and about how sheltered 
we truly happen to be."
The CMU G20 Arts Base has also been a center for those 
students managing independent G20 art projects to convene 
All over campus you can find their work, from stickers to 
sidewalk chalk to yarn sculpture. Projects have been as simp: 
as wheat-pasted flyers stating <3 G20 or as complicated as 
a gigantic HELP WANTED poster that covered the entire 
intramural field. Whatever the project, its clear that Carnegie 
Mellon students want to have their opinions heard.
With few limitations, no part of the campus has been left 
untouched. In windows and archways all over Carnegie 
Mellon, students have seen the eyes of Big Brother, a 
character from George Orwells novel 1984, staring back at 
them. The half faces are the workings of Nina Sarnelle, 
said Redwood. They are referencing the hopeless nontransparency of the G20 and how we are left only to watch 
these world leaders. We see what they do and decide when 
they discuss all of these important topics that affect our lives 
behind closed doors and we wanted to narrate the Orwellian 
fiction a little bit.
Aside from the shantytowns appearance, there is a 
plethora of other ways in which the G20 Arts Base has been 
misunderstood, and members involved were eager to explair 
We had a really unorthodox way of building in this space;

said Redwood. "People have been saying we took it from the
J by Meela Dudley | Assistant Pillbox Editor J
This past week, in light of the G20, students from Carnegie 
Mellon transformed the Fence into a patchwork quilt 
of political messages. However, many of the messages 
themselves were left unclear, and the site of what appeared to 
be a spray-painted junkyard imprisoning the Fence generated 
a feeling of opposition and disdain for the project. Those 
involved were left with a whole mess of misconception to sort 
out.
Somebody was like, 'I heard anarchists took the Fence,  
said Carolina Ramos, a senior in the Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts program. It was kind of funny; these girls walked by, 
and they were like I can't believe campus is letting them do 
this. Why dont they just stop them? 
Truth be told, there seemed to be a lot of rumors going around 
about the intentions of those involved in Project Shantytown. 
I kind of like the legend of it all, said Austin Redwood, also a 
senior in the BHA program. "That is why I havent been very 
vigilant about turning out rumors.
The G20, established in 1999, is a group of 20 international 
finance ministers and bank governors who come together 
once a year to discuss the global economy, and opposition 
against the conference is usually due to the exclusivity of it 
all.
This year, with the conference held right here in Pittsburgh, 
opposition forces have been plentiful, especially here at 
Carnegie Mellon. However, those opposed to the student 
activity at the Fence were not necessarily in favor of the G20. 
A majority of the opposition facing Project Shantytown was 
mainly because of its aesthetics.
I dont particularly see what their stance on the G20 is, said 
Ha Foley, a sophomore English major, so I dont think its a 
particularly effective protest. I dont understand what they're
trying to get across; its just a shantytown. I only saw one 
piece of art that actually said G20 GTFO, so other than that, 
it really just looks like a bunch of frat boys camped out at the 
Fence."
Because of the peculiar way in which those at the Fence went 
about protesting the G20, most onlookers assumed the worst. 
Apparently people thought we werent even students, said 
Redwood. They would yell at us, If you dont go here, you 
cant have the Fence, and then we would poke our heads out 
and they would be like, Oh, Im in a class with you. 
The best way to solve a confusing problem is to head straight 
to the source. In the heart of the Carnegie Mellon shantytown, 
over a soundtrack of hammering and laughter, Redwood was 
ready and willing to set the record straight. This is the CMU 
G20 Arts Base," said Redwood. It is a space in which people 
can build things and express themselves in relation to the 
G20. We see that people dont get a voice when summits like 
this come to town and we wanted to utilize a space in which 
they could make banners, have discussions, hold workshops, 
screen films, and give their side of the argument. The world 
leaders arent necessarily going to hear what we have to say, 
but we can at least hear it ourselves.
It turns out there was a lot more to this shantytown than 
expected. All throughout G20 week, students and professors 
alike gathered at the CMU G20 Arts Base to host parades, 
screen films, listen to lectures, and even participate in 
religious sermons. But as visitors soon found out, there was a 
reason for the Arts Bases less-than-appealing exterior.
We basically built a shantytown because we wanted to at 
least reference a little of the political impoverishment that 
comes with not being able to attend certain meetings that 
dcide the fate of a lot of people," said Redwood. Here were 
trying to build a structure that can evolve, that anybody can 
add on to. All of the art you see in here is somehow related 
to peoples ability to create something for themselves. Weve

so maybe we can set that straight. We had the Fence and the 
pledges were really nervous because they didnt want to be 
out here in November, so we lent part of the Fence to them. 
They were fine neighbors."
Many reported hearing that those camped at the Fence were 
serving punishment for their actions. "Thats a really funny 
story; Ive heard we got up to $1,000 in fire hazard fines, said 
Ramos. "The officers just came to tell us that we couldn't use 
tarps, so we stopped using tarps, simple as that.
The artists and protesters at the G20 Arts Base have tried 
to remain optimistic. Through all of the negative publicity 
and rumors, they have kept their shanty house doors wide 
open. Redwood put it best when he said, "we like building 
and talking and teaching and learning, even with those who 
disapprove of what were doing. Tell people to come by. In 
this glance into the inside of the G20 Arts Base, one thing 
became increasingly clear: You cant judge a movement by its 
appearance, even if it really looks down in the dumps.

Cook up simple but satisfying kai jeaw
Fried eggs, rice, and chili sauce create a delicious meal
As much as I love foie gras, oyster, and vin blanc (white 
wine), it is the simple dish of fried eggs that I always crave.
I fell in love with fried egg in high school; sure, I made 
spaghetti alfredo for my school lunch box, but kai jeaw, fried 
egg made Thai style, was my dinner.
Kai jeaw is a simple staple dish of Thailand  something like 
the peanut butter and jelly sandwich of America. This golden 
dish is something your mom makes when you complain 
of hunger at midnight. But you dont need to trouble your 
mother every time you crave it; you can buy a freshly fried 
omelet over rice for 20 baht (approximately $0.50) on the 
streets of Thailand.
Kai jeaw, simply put, is a deep fried omelet, and although it 
sounds easy to make, it is a dish that requires attention and 
involvement.
Heres my take on how to cook up light and airy, luminous 
gold, nutty tang, its-so-oily-dont-tell-my-mom kai jeaw.
Ingredients: Egg(s). One or two, depending on preference. 
Rice. Try pairing the dish with jasmine rice as well. One 
cup of oil. Peanut oil or olive oil is recommended if you can 
indulge in some. Wedge of lemon or lime.
Optional but highly recommended: Prik Nampra, a 
delicious Thai chilies and fish sauce and Thai chicken chili
Thai street vendors use a black wok on a blazing Asian stove 
to cook up some kai jeaw, but here in America, we must 
make do with a saucepan. I like my kai jeaw light and fluffy, 
and to do this you need cookware that is comparatively deep. 
Depending on your cookware, make sure the depth of oil in it 
is approximately an inch, and slowly heat the oil to a medium 
to high temperature.
Crack an egg in a separate bowl  theres a reason this 
instruction comes after you start to heat the oil  and while 
waiting for the oil to heat up, beat the egg with fork for a 
minute and add in a few drops of lemon juice.
To check if the oil is hot enough, drizzle a little bit of egg into 
the saucepan; the egg should fluff up immediately. If the egg 
takes a couple of seconds to bubble, the oil is not hot enough; 
make sure theres no smoke either.
Once the oil is hot enough, pour the egg into the 
saucepan. Start pouring the egg near the oil, and as you 
continue to pour, slowly lift the bowl higher so that 
the egg gets fluffier. Even when cooking with just 
a single egg, I fry them in two batches, ensuring 
enough room for the egg to expand to its full 
potential.
At this point, lower the heat to medium  you 
want to make sure you dont burn the egg.
Flip it once the top catches a golden touch and 
repeat so that the other side does too. Then serve 
the golden, fluffy kai jeaw on hot rice.
Some people like eating their egg with ground 
pork, sliced onion, or basil leaves. You can add 
these ingredients to your recipe as well, but 
remember that the more additions you make, the
less fluffy and more meaty your kai jeaw gets. Experiment 
with both and then take your pick.
You can also add some sticky sweet Thai chili sauce, bottles 
of which are often seen at the white trucks serving Thai food 
on Margaret Morrison Street. It adds flavor and spice to the 
dish, so go ahead and give it a try.
I enjoy my egg golden-brown and eat it with chilies and fish 
sauce. The sauce is pretty easy to make and can be done in a 
few simple .steps.
Ingredients: A few Asian chilies. Fish sauce. Wedge of 
lemon. You can use the same wedge used to make the fried 
egg; only a few more drops of lemon juice are needed. A 
couple cloves of garlic. In my opinion, much like butter, garlic 
makes everything tastier.
Cut the chilies crosswise and make them very thin, then 
put them into a small sauce bowl. Thinly slice the garlic as 
well  again, the thinner the better  and place them with 
the chilies. Squeeze a few drops  three to five drops  of 
lemon juice, and add just enough fish sauce to cover all the 
ingredients. Let the sauce sit until your meal is ready.
I prefer to make the chili and fish sauce before cooking my 
meal to give some time for the flavor of all the ingredients 
to come together. This sauce can be eaten with just about 
anything. It is a good idea to refrigerate leftover sauce and 
add more chilies, garlic, or fish sauce when needed. This 
allows the flavor to develop well.
Just as a warning: this dish, along with anything fried, is not 
recommended to be cooked during the winter by people who 
have their own kitchens. Clothes and beds  and the entire 
apartment, for that matter  will end up smelling like kai 
jeaw for the entire week.

battle of the bands
Sigma Phi Epsilon hosted their annual charity event, Battle of the 
Bands, in Rangos Hall in the University Center on Saturday. Pictured 
is the winning band, Argyle's Revenge, that played music from the 
acoustic alternative genre and had a great stage presence. Last year's 
winner, Tim Ruff Trio, returned to put on a special performance that 
the audience enjoyed immensely.
