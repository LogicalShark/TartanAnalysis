year." ;  For  even ' non-partisans Y<m .Admit, that, - although the Ski* bos'got the breaks to win in 1920, Carnegies first victory . over the President, the Black and Red has received the major portion .of the breaks; in every game eince.
' Another 'angle of the case is .that Carnegie has never, won -la Little Washington. Puttingthese two together, it might be said that W. and J; always got the breaks on their home field. In fact, to make ise' ot  pun, they, got a big break n their favor last year, just when heTartans got started.  ^ '
This ,year the game., is being played on a neutral field, so neither team can claim an advan: ge ou this point. ;lt Is the first % tent of the year for1 Both teams, J should prove to be. a thriller, irnegie has won-iits first . two mes In 1 easy .fashion, 'but some lettion whether'these easy vloiorlea were due to strength of .the Plaldi or to lack of strength: of their opponents.

It is the general opinion of footbatl eXporlB that the winner; of Saturda.y6'game 1 hasa very good chanco -to cop Tritato honors for this yehr; ' 1u connection with thla. it might be sald that 'there Is now a Tri-State "Big F*onr-Caniogio, ..Pitt, -W. andJ., and West Virginia, each of which 'mete all others for..tbe' first time this year.
i -Andy-JCerr,: W. and oH2. hew coach, Is very hnxloua to win this game for'two; reasons; because It Is hlfl first big test. ^ as a head coach;' and because of bis. former affiliation with :the TJrilverelty of Pittsburgh: It>111 be-remeln'bcfed Ihftt he at  one time -coached' ,the Preahmoa football teamat -Pitt/ as well N the varsity basketball and track team.
