I WHITE FRIARS 1
v&o&o
If any writer ever desired a superlative expression 
i'cir business, he should just drop in at a rehearsal of 
the W hite Friars andever after when desiring to 
make me of the expression say, As busy as a White 
Friar a half week before the show. The chorus 
"gii'ls in scanty attire and with dark rings under 
their eyes from extra rehearsals, may be seen going 
through their stunts as tho life itself depended 
thereon, and the members of the cast, tired out, are 
at the stage where the very words they say in the 
course of the play loose all meaning, and find that 
their conversational ability is sadly impared to the 
extent of consisting of extracts from 'the lines of the 
play. The glee chorus sit up in bed at night with 
visions of horrible tangles occuring in the finalles of 
the acts where they are compelled to try to keep up 
with 'the bewildering movements of the dancing 
chorus, and all the members of the orchestra can 
see when they close their eyes, ds a half bald-headed 
man, red in the face from howling, shaking a rail
road tie at them. The business manager and all the 
mebers of the executive staff are at their wits end, 
and the stage and musical directors have an appear
ance of being well on the road to insanity, that is to 
anyone who happened in on the doings and was not 
familiar with the mystic rites of stage craft. In 
reality nothing unusual Is going on at all; the hardest 
rehearsing has been put off until the last minute, as 
usual, and the dress affair is according to precedent 
the worst imaginable. So that is all there is to be 
expected. To the initiated, it means that things are 
going on at their normal rate and that the Show will 
be in good condition by the opening night.
His Highness, the Chef has presented an appearence not unlike the one described all week, and ac
cording to what those qualified to judge have said, 
will be in the best shape when the company of 60 
take it to Sewickley this Saturday night, to give the 
first public performance. The entire' company will 
make the trip returning the same night.
The date for the exchanging of the tickets marked 
Subscriber's Cards, is May 24, at 9 a. m., at the 
Nixon, and the big show will play an afternoon and 
an evening performance at that theatre on May 29.
At the present writing everything points to a suc
cessful opening this week, so that by the time the 
Pittsburg date has arrived, the clever musical comedy 
will be in a most polished condition. The Tartan 
will give a full account of the initial performance 
in next weeks issue.

Oh, the pretty, pretty flowers, sang out a child
ish voice.
I had not time to turn before a little figure shot 
past me and sped across the road. Instinctively I 
paused, expecting to see the beautiful red and yel
low tulips crushed under the childs ruthless feet.
I was pleasantly disappointed, however, as I watched. 
Flitting from flo\yer to flower, like a big butterfly, 
the little girl threaded her way among her delicate 
playmates. Here, she would close up the cup of the 
flower in her tiny fist; then, she would otpen it gently 
and gaze in childish wonder at what lay revealed. 
Then, with a wave of her hand she scampered off 
and was (it the wind that inclined every gay tulip 
head in the direction she had gone?

Thursday morning the girls of the C division of 
the Plebe class held a class sleeper in the English 
room. The exercises were opened by Miss Fisher, 
who gave a short and pointed talk from the text, 
"There is no excuse for not handing in themes. 
She then inquired what time we had gone to bed the 
night before. The answers showed that many of us 
had been up long after the hour judged correct by 
the health department. Of course we had been 
studying! So we were invited to put our heads down 
over the tables and rest. Ten minutes of reposeful 
silence followed, each girl doing her best to get in 
all the sleep possible. At the end of this period, 
Miss Fisher gave another address on Why Girls 
Run Down. Themes were then served with garnishings of Ls and Fs, and all left voting the affair 
a most unique and memorable occasion.

Last Wednesday afternoon, Prof. Esquerre and 
Dr. Martin took the Senior Household Arts girls 
through the Childrens Hospital for the purpose of 
studying the effects of mal-nutrition. This is a part 
of the field work of the course in Chemistry, Diete
tics and Home Nursing. The suffering of the poor 
little innocents and their pitiable condition was too 
much for some of the girls and for a time it looked 
as if u-iey might require the attention of the hospital 
staff. However, a dose of fresh air and sunshine 
revived them and all were able to return to their 
homes. It isn't likely that any of us will ever forget 
the visit on the lesson it taught us.
'Thursday, sixty visiting club women from Monongahela were served with luncheon in the apartment. 
The lunch was prepared and served by the dietary 
division of the Sr. H. A. under the direction of Miss 
Nickerson. The menu was dainty and attractive 
and, what is more to the point, furnished the proper 
number of calories.

The doorbell broke the other day, 
Pop couldnt make it ring,
Said he: Ill have to get a man 
To fix the blamed old thing.
My mother said: "Oh, dont do that, 
Think what youd have to pay. 
And then she took a hairpin out 
And fixed it right away.
We lost the back door key last week, 
Twas when the door was locked;
Pop fumed around and said things till 
The neighbors were all shocked;
Then Mom she got a hairpin out 
An poked, an' pretty quick 
She had the bolt turned in the lock,
The hairpin did the trick.
Theres nothin' much that Mom can't do 
With hairpins, see.ms as like,
One day shell fix Potps busted watch, 
An next twill be my bike;
If we wuz poor Ill bet that she 
Could make hard luck take wings 
By goin round the city with 
A hairpin, fixin things.

On last Friday the night schools closed for the 
remainder of the school year. This marked the com
pletion of the fourth consecutive year of their ex
istence, and in one more year there will graduate 
the first class from the night school of Applied Sci
ence. The night school for Apprentices and Jour
neymen, due to its shorter course, already has a 
graduating class, and so from now on the schools 
will be running with every class in each of the 
schools represented. A good many seem to have 
fallen by the wayside during the past year, but there 
still is a large class, and the fact that it is so large 
speaks well for the staying qualities of the men who 
are compelled to go to school four and five nights 
a week after working all day.
During the year past there seems to have been a 
considerable growth of good feeling between the day 
and night schools, due probably to a better under
standing of each other and also due to some extent 
to the fact that the newness of things has worn off 
to most of us and has left us better able to appre
ciate the other fellows viewpoint.
The Tartan extends the night men its best wishes 
for a prosperous summer and hopes to see every 
night man back next fall.
During the last few lectures on Music that have 
given by Mr. Heinroth, it has been noticed what an 
unusual and entirely unnecessary amount of noise 
goes on. The disturbance reached a climax last 
week, when several persons occupied seats in the 
gods of the lecture hall, and proceeded to conduct 
themselves in a maner that would be more in keep
ing with the same location in certain burlesque play
houses of Pittsburg, than in a splendid and instrucAVVVL ARUAVLLE SPJAEC
A very enjoyable dance was given by the combined 
Civil and Crucible Clubs on Friday evening, May 7, 
at the Keystone Club. Dancing commenced at 8.45 
and lasted until midnight. We might mention how 
NireJlas men discoursed sweet strains, how the 
beautiful ladies and handsome men tripped the light 
fantastic, and how Uncle G. W. Ketler shone, as a 
fusser, but time and sipace forbid. Suffice it to say 
everybody enjoyed it and went home tired, but 
happy.

Tech lost a hard luck game to Oberlin last Thurs
day by a score of 50. Tech had not been together 
for nearly two weeks and the leek of practice was 
easily seen in the early part of the game. Kemp 
was on the rubber for Tech and pitched a nice, 
steady game. Erratic fielding behind him in the 
first and third innings gave Oberlin their five runs. 
In the fifth inning Tech got three men on but Green 
Pea Harrison was not there with the necessary hit 
and they all died on bases. In the ninth Capt. Coldren landed on one for what seemed to be a home 
run, but the ball struck a house which forms part of 
the left field fence and bounced into the fielders 
hands, and Cold fen was held on first. Barclay was 
in the game again playing at 'his old position behind 
the bat. He landed on the ball in his old-time form, 
but on account of his lame knee, was not able to run. 
There seems to be a good deal of dissatisfaction 
about the action of the Board of Control in closing 
up the new field until fall. If some further action 
is not taken it seems likely that the ball team will 
go to pieces. The home games will have to be can
celed, and it is not very probable that the out-oftown games will be played, as they are nearly all 
return games. The score of the Oberlin game by 
innings:

The question is often asked, How much of Techs 
student body is local and from how wide a field is 
the remainder drawn? With a view toward answer
ing that query the following statistics were pre
pared. They show that the non-local student body 
has been drawn from a wide area, and that contrary 
to what a great many think, the night schools draw 
almost as large a proportion of their patronage from 
places at a distance as do the day schools. The 
distribution literally includes the four corners of 
the United -States and a majority of the other States 
are represented:

Well, at last Spring 'has arrived after rather a 
rough voyage. But none the less are we delighted at 
its appearance. And while the birds may sing and 
other signs make themselves apparent, the merry 
crack of the base-balL bat presses Itself upon us 
with ever increasing force.
And here is the gist of the story. The Plebes 
have a team, a good one. Since early spring, in 
spiite of adverse weather conditions, Captain Mullen 
has had the candidates hard at work. Pfouts and 
Dosey have Lent a hand and demonstrated that they 
have not forgotten their hase-ball days. Their coach
ing was of great value to the fellows. Finally, the 
class responded nobly and furnished uniforms for 
the entire team.
So here they are, fully equipped and ready to tackle 
the hard schedule which Manager Keally has ar
ranged for them. We still like to think of our foot
ball team and we certainly wish the hase-ball team 
as much success. So get out, Plebes, and support 
the team. Show them that you have their success 
at heart and that it means something to you.
Although no official announcement has been 
made to the class, it is the hope of the officers that 
the Plebes attend the play to be given by the White 
Friars at the Nixon on the eventing of 'May 29ith. It 
is very seldom that the entire class gets together 
for a social time, and this is a splendid opportunity. 
We shall not only have a good time but help the 
White Friars along.
Now that the free tickets are all out, we probably 
feel better.
A banquet is to be held by section D in Prof. 
Doyles banquet hall on Thursday morning. There 
will .be a feast (?) of wit, hut, alas, no eatings.
We were delighted to hear of ithe increased en
trance requirements. Misery loves company. So 
heres to the next years Plebes.
Dr. James has a great plan of putting Spiegal into 
iron. Little did we think that Spiegal would attain 
such fame.
