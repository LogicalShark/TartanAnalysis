VOL. XIII. NO. 4.CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIAFEB. 19, 1919
(UNUSUAL SCHOLARSHIPS OPENED TO SCIENCE MEN
The (School of Applied Science of 
he Carnegie Institute of .Technology 
las received notification from the 
College of Engineering and Engineerng Experiment Station, University of 
llinois, announcing some post-graduite assistantships, which will be of 
reat interest to graduates who have 
ieen considering furthering their 
ducation at the close of this current 
Lcademic year. The announcement 
tates that there will be eight vaancies to be filled in the Research 
(Graduate Assistantships, which are 
inaintained by the Engineering Ex
periment Station of the University of 
Illinois. These assistantships, for 
ach of which there is an annual 
tipend of $500 and freedom from all 
lees, except the matriculation and 
iploma fee, are open to graduates of 
pproved American and foreign uniersities and technical schools who 
re prepared to undertake graduate 
,tudy in engineering, physics and aplied chemistry. The course contitutes two consecutive years, at the 
xpiration of which period, if all the 
requirements have been met, the de
cree of Master of Science will be conierred.
In addition to these -assistantships, 
;here are available two Research 
raduate Assistantships in Gas En;ineering, which are supported' by the 
llinois Gas Association, carrying 
rith them the same amount of money 
,nd the same Conditions as are aplied to the Assistantships formerly 
lentioned.
Nominations to these positions are 
lade from applications received by 
e Director of the Station each year, 
t later than March 1. The nominaons are based upon the character 
,nd scholastic attainments, and!
romise of success in the principal 
ine of study or research to which 
;lie candidate proposes to devote himelf. Preference is given those aplicants who have had some practical 
xperience following - the completion 
if their undergraduate work. Appointents are made in the spring, and 
ey become effective the first day of 
iie following September. Any aditional information may be obtained 
)y addressing the Director. Engineer
ing Experiment Station, University 
)f Illinois, Urbana, 111.
It is thought by Dean Mott of the 
School of Applied Science that it 
(would be well worth the while of the 
Students of the Senior Science Class 
3 conscientiously consider this oportunity. If any student feels, with 
is former training, that his future 
ork could be furthered and bettered 
y such a post-graduate, course, it 
ould be well for him to put in an 
jpiieation for such unusual and fariching scholarship as the above ofirs.
UIIDING CONSTRUCTION CLUB HELD DANQUET
That much heralded Building Con
duction banquet finally came to 
ass. It was held at the National Resaurant, Tuesday, February 11.
After P. 0; Good had completely 
onquered a double serving, the evenigs program began. There were
lany and interesting talks by both 
acuity and students.' Included in 
aese was a talk by Professor Dunells in which he related the hisory of the club, and of the graduates 
f the Building Construction course, 
le also encouraged the members to 
:eep up the spirit with which they had 
tarted. Included' in the other talks 
rere many helpful suggestions for the 
etterment of the club.
Judging from the spirit shown by

TECHS BIGGEST EVENT
EVERYBODY COME
MUSICAL CLUBS TO HOLD SMOKER FEB. 25
February 17, 1919.
The Carnegie Musical Clubs are 
looking forward to the get-together 
smoker on February 25, in the Union. 
Buchanan, the reader for the last 
year, has a new stunt up his sleeve. 
He is being pushed hard by many 
new stunt1 makers. All are working 
hard to put their stunts across, as 
these stunts will be specialties on the 
program. However, the executive 
committee feels that there is much 
talent in the club which has not de
veloped. The committee, therefore, 
urges that this latent talent get busy. 
Have your stunts ready for a tryout 
on the night of February 25.
The contract has been signed for 
the annual concert at Mayview on 
March 3. This year GO men are mak
ing the trip, instead of 40 men, as in 
previous years. The Tech Musical 
Clubs have a monopoly on this con
cert, as this is the sixth consecutive 
year for a concert. The clubs have 
always been received royally, and no 
doubt the same shall be extended this 
year. In summing up the concert it is 
about the same as ever.
The same week, on March 7 and 8, 
the clubs make a trip to Latrobe and 
Greensburg. The concert will be at 
Latrobe on Friday night, March 7. 
After the concert the club will enter
tain at a dance. After spending the 
night in Latrobe, the club will -give 
a concert in Greensburg on Saturday 
night, March 8.
All men must attend all practices, 
in order to make these trips. Also, 
they must be in credit standing. 
Plans are already under way for the 
Home Concert', which will come some
time in April, the exact date not be
ing set as yet. Watch The Tartan 
for the announcement.

TRACK OUTLOOK BRIGDT; TECHS LARGEST SQUAD REPORTS IN FIRST WEEK
TECH AND WASH-JEFF RESUME FOOTBALL
Track is^ showing indications this 
year of taking its place beside foot
ball as one of Techs most popular 
sports. In the past track work has 
had more participants than the other 
sports, but this year promises to 
break all records. Seventy-five men 
are now enrolled. Many of last years 
men have not yet reported and the 
squad is growing at the rate of 10 to 
15 men a day. Much good material 
from first year men, athletes with 
high school records, has appeared, 
and many upper classmen who are 
new in this sport, have come out for 
the intensive physical training to take 
the place of gym class. A series of 
inter-class and inter-school track 
meets is being scheduled. These will 
start about the middle of April.
I After a break in football relations, 
dating back to the game of 1912, Carregie Institute of Technology and 
Washington and Jefferson College 
have decided to resume competition 
on the gridiron next, season, and last 
night a game was arranged t to 
be played in Washington on October 
11. Tech athletic officials are think
ing of trying a session of spring foot
ball practice this year. The gridiron 
schedule of the Skibos, as arranged 
thus far, follows:
October 11W. & J. at' Washing-'

CARNEGIE GRADUATE TO RETURN AS INSTRUCTOR
Mr. George Me. Porter, graduate of 
the School of Applied Science, Car
negie Institute of Technology, has re
turned to that institution to resume 
his duties as instructor of electrical 
engineering. Mr. Porter served 14 
months as lieutenant, junior grade, of 
the U. S. Naval Reserve; nine months 
of this time he was on the U. S. 
Steamship Wyoming, which was with 
the British-Grande Fleet in Foreign 
waters. During his overseas service, 
Former Lieutenant Porter had many 
eventful experiences and feels that 
the time spent with the U. S. Navy 
was interesting as well as instructive. 
It will be of interest to the stiulentbody to learn that Mr.. Porter was one 
of the privileged 8,000 who witnessed 
the ignominious surrender of the Ger
man fleet on November 21, 191S. Mr,. 
Porter expressed his opinion of the 
surrender in the words of a famous 
old sea captain who said, A ship is 
made for one of two purposeseither 
to fight or to sink.
LUMNI ORDERS TARTAN
The Tartan was surprised and 
eased, too, the past week, to reive an order for a subscription from 
le of its old timers, Wrarren K. 
illiams, better known as Schoppy. 
Williams is in the 308th Ammunition 
rain in France: This was followed
y one from H. R. Averswald from 
ulsa, Oklahoma.
Th Tartan is now mailed to the 
>ur corners of the earthone to 
apan, one to India, one to France 
fid one to Oklahoma.
This is the spirit for which Tech 
noted. It is the spirit that will 
lake it famous and it is this spirit 
bat the undergraduates must show, 
/ake up, Freshmen! Show your

and through his efforts the material 
subv/itfced by the various Instructors 
of the course was assembled into 32 
chapters, making it about ready for 
publication. An interesting feature 
concerning this work is the fact that 
the data for the manuscript, together 
with the cuts, was gathered and com
piled in the Electrical Engineering 
Department, and turned over to the 
United States Government for Its 
use. Mr. Dennison re-wrote some 10

LETTERS RECEIVED FROM VET WILLIAMS
Members of Zigma Rho fraternity 
received a letter recently from Vet 
Williams. Vet, the captain-elect of 
our football team, is getting in shape 
to play the best ever game this com
ing fall. He is assistant superintend
ent of the Vanadium mine of the 
Standard Chemical Company, at Naturita, Colorado. Just now he weighs 
192 pounds. His work is entihely of 
an out-of-door nature, so of course, he 
is becoming better off, physically, 
every day. We can look for some fine 
playing from Vet this fall, for he 
promises to be back.
FIRST STUDENT ASSEMBLY HELD IN MUSIC HALL
On Wednesday morning, February 
12, tht entire student body met in a 
general assembly for the first time 
this year, in response to a request 
from President Hamerschlag. The 
program was opened by singing the 
National Anthem. An orchestra of 30 
students of the musical department, 
under the direction of Professor J. 
Vick OBrien, played several selec
tions which were greatly appreciated 
by the audience.
President Hamerschlag then out
lined the policies of the Institution 
for the future and presented the plan 
by which military science will become 
a factor in the school. Showing the 
responsibilities of citizenship of the 
educated and the vital necessity of an 
elficient reserve army, he asked the 
students of Tech to consider whether 
they shall put themselves outside 
the pale of the duties, of citizens, or 
shall do as the students of many 
other institutions of learning are do
ingkeeping a large part of the 
student body prepared to help the 
Nation when necessary. He pointed 
out that the traditions of the Institute, 
while against the establishment of an 
Infantry sectionof the Reserve Of
ficers Training Corps, are not. op
posed to formation of special, sec
tions. such as Artillery, Aeronautics, 
Signal Corps, Ordnance, and Engi
neering and Metallurgical sections. | 
Therefore, this 11. O. T. C. Unit will / 
be established in the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology as such sec
tions have already been established 
at Yale, Harvard, Cornell aiid Prince
ton. Those students _ choosing this 
work will receive, upon graduation, 
a commission as second lieutenants 
in the Reserye Army in addition to 
their diplonjas from the school. Four 
units of the R. O. T. C.' are hoped to 
be established by next fall: Field
Artillery, Aeronautics, Signal Corps 
and Engineering Corps. 'Pile stu
dent body will be divided into two 
groups; those preparing for commis
sions and those who, instead of 
military work, must take a program 
of physical training. The institute 
itself will be divided Into six groups: 
First, Academic; second, Engineering 
and Science; third, Arts; fourth, 
Margaret Morrison Croup; fifth, It. O. 
T. C.; sixth, Personnel and Psycho
logical Group.
President Hamerschlag thon an
nounced new appointments to official 
positions as follows: Mr. Tarboll, to
bo Dean of Mon; Dr. Frank Day as 
Dean of the Institute; Mr. Esqilerre, 
as Professor of Hygiene and Dietetics, 
who, with Dr. Day, will have charge 
of the physical program; Dr. Thomas 
S. Baker as Secretary of the Institute. 
The enthusiasm of (he students was 
unbounded when President Hamer
schlag announced the engaging, as 
athletic director and the worlds 
greatest baseball player, John II. 
(I-Ionus) Wagneir; and, when Honus" 
appeared on the stage, the enthusiasm 
was deafening. 1-Ie spoke a few j 
words, dealing with the bright pros
pects for Tech in the athletic line! 
The securing of Walter P. Steffen as 
football coach was announced. An
nouncement was also made of the or
ganizing of the Department of Educa
tional Research, under Dr. Guy Whip
ple, who was Professor of Psychology 
at Johns Hopkins.
The Y. M. C. A. hut has been ac
quired by the Institute and will be 
turned over to the students as a 
recreational center in connection with 
the Union. As soon as the weather 
permits, work will be started on 
tennis courts, whch will occupy the 
ground in front of the hut. A house 
on Woodlawn avenue has been ac
quired and will be fitted up as a club 
and dining hall for the faculty.
Dr. Day gave a short talk In which 
he emphasized the need for military 
training. His speech was very inter
esting, not only because of the hu
morous trench stories that he told, 
but because of his personal acquaint
ance with the necessity of prepared
ness.
The Glee Club made its debut, un
der the leadership of Mr. Harvey B. 
Gaul, and pleased the audience with a 
catchy Tech song.
The meeting closed with mass sing
ing of Dear Oid Tech.
Tech won from Westminster, Fri
day night, in one of the fastest games 
this season. The first half was any
bodys, one side being in the lead one 
minute and the other the next. The
first half ended with the score 16-14,
Westminster.
The second half Tech came back in 
whirlwind style, and Westminster 
was "out of luck. The shooting of 
Hamman and (he fast floor work of 
Abrams established Techs suprem
acy, Hamman getting 12 out of 17 
floor baskets. Armstrong starred for 
Westminster.

NEW YORK PRODUCER ENTERTAINEDBYDRAMATS
Mr. B. Iden Payne, the New York 
producer, was the guest of honor at 
a Valentine dinner party, which was 
held, between the afternoon and even
ing rehearsals of "The Rivals."
The table was laid in the dining 
room, which was docoratod for I ho 
occasion In pink and white, Limerick 
cards which revealed the sallont 
traits of each guest, and his name, 
wore used to assign the places. The 
huge heart-shaped cake w/is carved" 
with the ponderous scimitar of 
Karadjordgd, which figured In the 
Red Cross Pageant, In which the 
Dramatists made their initial bow In 
Now York.
Haron MuonehenhouHon, who has 
rocontly returned from camp, gave a 
very clovor reproduction of the "hero 
speaker, who has suffered from too 
much of his own gas." The "Plobo 
Pledge," to which the new members 
gracefully sumblttod, contained some 
rather startling additions to the al
ready numerous obligations under 
which they labor, and, Impressed upon 
them, permanently, It Is hoped, the 
absolute superiority of all upperclass
men.
All tin* new students present had re
turned since registration day. Former 
members of the department who have 
been In service are gradually return
ing to the fold, and it is expected that 
In spite of the late start, this will be 
one of the most successful seasons 
In the history of the department. A 
number of plays are being prepared 
for an early production, announcements of which will be made later.
FRESHMArrp LOSES
The Freshmen team returned with 
the short end of the score, but with 
a satisfaction in defeat that was 
commendable.
At DuBois they played a splendid 
game, fighting every minute of the 
game. They played the DuBois regu
lar line-up, and were also hampered 
by a low ceiling.
The Freshmen line-up was:
Gibson ............................................. Forward
Weaver ........................................... Forward
Harberger ........................................ Center
Skym .................................................... Center
Helfrich ............................................. Guard
Godden .................................................. Guard
Helfrich and Weaver starred for 
Tech.
Score39-19, DuBois.
At Punxsutawney the score was a 
little more one-sided, being 52-29 for 
the opponents but at the end of the 
first half their lead was only (5 points. 
It was a case of a one-maii team 
Jordan starring with 15 baskets. '

Mr. Percy L. Reed, formerly in
structor in Civil Engineering, is now 
First Lieutenant in the Ordnance 
Corps. He ws recently transferred 
from Mussel island, Alabama, to Ni
trate Plant No. 3, Ordnance Depot, 
Toledo.
Mr. A. P. Kruger, formerly in

elected a director of the Squirrel 
Hill Board of Trade.
Mr. George W. Lyon, formerly in
structor in English Industries Facul
ty, is now principal of the Sewickley 
High School.
The Wtir is won but it isnt over! Nor will it be oyer while there 
are a million and a hall! American soldiers in France. True, the Hun 
is down and out, but it is a little preposterous for us to array our
selves in gaudy apparel and parade around when Hie government is 
urging us to buy Thrift Stamps and is promulgating plans for an
other loan!
Congratulations, girls! You have set the pace and the men have 
followed suit. . No flowers. Instead of putting this five dollars into 
these fading symbols of extravagance, while our debts are still un
paid, let us now as last%ycar, lend it to Uncle Sam. Buy J lirift 
Stamps.
THE CAMPUSWHAT?
Keep oil' the grass; yes or no? To look at it now, one would 
think it doesnt matter, but spring isnt far away. Then truly can 
.you sec what Keep oil! the grass means. It is the Tech campus, 
your campus. .Help to keep it clean.
After much delay and labor grass has been started around, tlie 
fronts of the buildings. Why tramp it outV Last week the Tartan 
asked students and faculty to keep ofC the grass. We hope they 
will comply.
The Tartan aims to boost everything that will go to make a 
bigger and better Tech and it solicits the support of every student 
in policies that make for a liner school. It believes that a campus 
is a prerequisite to the appearance of any college and therefore sug
gests again tlmt ovcry one refrain from tramping out the grass by 
using the walks. That is what walks are made for, walk on them!
Help the Tartan get what the majority of the students want 
by complying with I his request.
CHANGE IN STAFF
Mr. Kmriek, the editor ol! this paper, has found it necessary to 
resign from (he stali in order that he may devote more time to his 
studies. The stall feels the loss of Hj&or-in-Chicl! Emrick and wishes 
him every success in his studies.
His piace will be taken by T. W. Allsworth, the present business 
manager. Mr. Allsworth is a, graduate of the University ol. Denver, 
in the department ol! English and journalism and was editor ol' the 
Denver Clarion the last year he was at that school. He believes that 
with the support ol: the students he can guide a good, progressive 
Tartan.
POLICY
The policy of the Tartan will be aggressive. It will boost every
thing that will benefit the school and will knock anything that 
hinders its progress. A school paper is the students paper. Every
one take part.

FROM PRESIDENTS OFFICE
President Lowell, of Harvard, puts the truth plainly when he 
says in his annual report that There seems to be no doubt that our 
losses in battle were much larger than they need have been if the 
officers had been more familiar with the conditions they were called 
upon to meet. * * * Surely it ought to be possible to teach the
art of war as other applied sciences or arts are taught. Therefore 
he earnestly recommends the giving of military instruction and'practical training at colleges and universities. Nothing could be more 
inspiring and auspicious than the utterance of such sentiments by the 
head of the senior American university. But we are afraid it will 
cause Dr. Lowell to be condemned as a bloody-minded and murderous 
imperialist by those gentle souls who think it better that a thousand 
men should perish on the battlefield because of lack of training, than 
that one should receive instruction in advance in the art of war.
THE NEW PROGRAM.
The policy for the coming year, as 
outlined last Wednesday by President 
tl-lamorschlag, illustrates that the trus
tees and faculty are beginning more 
and more to appreciate that an educa
tion to bo of greatest value must have
the proper background, it Is obvious  develop a great team if the student
in athletics, leadership in scholarship; 
all three tend to develop a firm foun
dation upon which to develop a con
st motive mentality.
All of the attractive environments 
which the faculty may place about, our 
school life can be of little value if w 
do not utilize them. We may hav 
the best of coaches, but he can not
that, It. is necessary to study those 
things which we will need to know In 
later life. But really, the greatest 
value of an education is to develop the 
quality of leadership. In school we 
may best develop this by entering 
whole-heartedly into school activities. 
Leadership in class affairs, leadership

president offered to see whether ma
terials for the erection of a partition 
similar to that surrounding the tables 
of the Turbine Engineers should be 
erected. At the same time it was 
suggested that tentative plans looking 
toward the housing of the Faculty 
Club in a building of its own were

Standing pn a high hill among the 
ruins of a tower from which the 
lcalser viewed the battle of Verdun, 
was a thrill enjoyed by Sergeant 
Sunny Kesner of Natrona, former 
Carnegie Tech star quarterback who is 
now in France with the Pittsburgh 
engineers, the 15th regiment, accord
ing to a letter received yesterday by 
his sister, Miss Inez Kesner of Na
trona Heights.
He declares the Fifteenth Engi
neers recently completed construction 
of a single track railroad from Ver
dun 'to Sedan. He intimated his regi
ment would likely be home some 
time in February.
In part he writes:
1 am not admitting .that today is 
anything other than the 25th of De 
cember, still It isnt so bad as it 
might, be. Your 9x4x3 arrived 
today and surely was appreciated 
for its the first time Ive seen can
dy for a long time. .We have been 
up in this country .lor over a month 
and have not seen such a thing as a 
Y. M. C. A. or a newspaper, nothing 
but work, mud and rain.
We are repairing the railroad 
from Verdun to Sedan and have it 
just about completed, that is, one 
single track. The Germans just filled 
the place full of holes, and dynamited 
almost, every rail joint, so we had 
 quite a little job. This is the valley 
that the Americans came up. the val-. 
ley of the Meuse river, and this 
place is as far as they got when the 
armistice was signed on the eleventh.
In Historic Place.
This place, too, is quite historic, 
as a battle ground of other previous 
wars'. There is a 'tomb in a little 
place' right here where you can see 
lying on the floor the .skulls and 
skeletons of 900 Frenchmen, killed at 
the Battle of Sedan in 1870. All 
the skulls are lying there In a per
fect straight line, and you can see 
the old rotten clothin'g dropping 
down around the bones of the skele
tons. On the other side of the same 
tomb 1,100 Bavarians lay buried, in 
this case, as the Germans in coming 
through this country in 1915 picked 
theirs up and buried them. The 
country up and about here is shot up
slightly, but not nearly so much as 
the places down about Verdun, which 
is called the underground city, there 
being movies and everything under-* 
ground, but above all is a huge pile j 
of rocks, although the ancient walls 
about the city still are pretty good. I
"You should see the thing we call | 
home. We have a train of box cars, | 
which we call Colonel Sturtevants 
Flying Circus. In each car there 
are 33 bunks, or just like shelves, 
for 33 little men, the littler the bet
ter. Said shelves are built three 
high, and there isnt enough room in 
them to sleep on your side. If you 
are on your stomach and want to 
turn over you must get out of bed 
and turn and get back in that way. 
The aisle down the middle of the 
car is just about two feet wide, and 
quite dark. Just imagine 33 men 
rolling out of said shelves into said 
little aisle all at once and trying to 
get dressed in record time so as not 
to be late at the morning formation, 
revelle, boots, shoes and everything 
imaginable having been dropped into 
said aisle the night before. Wow! the 
mad house. I sleep in a bottom 
bunk, consequently I can get on the 
floor easily.
Souvenirs Plenty.
This country is just full of Ger
man souvenirs, but one cant carry 
the stuff along and it is very incon
venient and such a red tape opera
tion to ship anything, and besides 
souvenirs mean so little that we let 
them lay. However, I did start a 
helmet, a belt buckle and some Ger
man cartridge holders which I found 
in some of the trenches near Mouzon; these I mailed but they may 
never get home. I still have a few 
souvenirs which I got when I was up 
at St. Mihiel, in the trenches and 
dugouts of the Germans, shortly after 
the Germans were chased out. Of 
course I was just visiting; and also 
a few of the trips I mentioned be
fore, up at Mont Faucon, when the 
fighting was still going on at that 
place. That was the only time I was 
actually under shell-fire, and they 
sure were bursting around there, 
with soldiers walking around paying 
little attention to them. I think the 
closest I had was a shell passing di-1 
rectly over my head, about 20 feet 
above it and hitting a building right 
in back of me. The scream of the 
shell sure is. a thrilling sensation. 
The air up there had 30 and 40 air
planes up at once, with anti-aircraft 
shells bursting all about them. Five 
observation balloons were up at once, 
and you could hear machine guns 
popping away.'
I stood on the high hill in the 
remains of the tower from which the 
kaiser watched the battle of Ver
dun, and looked down on miles of 
the American artillery banging away 
at the Germans, some of them were 
behind me. I visited Nancy a couple 
of times, which is a nice little city, 
though shot up some; ,and went 
from there up to the third line, where 
not much could be seen, as things 
were usually quiet along that front. 
For quite a while I was stationed at 
Neufchateau and for still, a longer 
time at the Jonchery, near Chaumont, where General Pershing had 
his headquarters at the time. We 
built a 'big ammunition depot and 
railroad yards there and I had quite 
a bit to do with the engineering 
of it.
Now we have only a couple days 
job left on .this railroad here and it 
is rumored that we start back. Truly 
I expect to get home n February 
some time.

Many Australian birds, such as the

black-and-white fantail and bush lark, 
sing regularly at night. During the 
mating season the blue wren occa
sionally charms the night air with his 
delightful music. The magpie, too, at 
times breaks into song when most of 
the other members of the choir are in 
the , land of dreams. Many bush 
dwellers contend' that the magpies 
nocturnes denote fine weather. The 
persistent calls of the coaehwhip and 
the satin bird, they say, ;herald the 
coming of wet weather. Another har

LEWIS B. FRANKLIN,
War Loan Director.
Those are the things for which we 
are going to pay with the Fifthand) 
lastLiberty Loan, Mr. Franklin ex
plained at a meeting of Liberty Loan, 
county chairmen in this city.
That is what I .mean when I say. 
that this money you are going to raise 
through the things already bought 
with the credit of itis paying for 
the saving of a half a million Ameri
can lives.
The speed and bravery of the 
American dough-boy affected the 
German on the front line more than it 
did the men at German general head
quarters; but the fact that America, 
had ten tons of mustard gas ready for 
shipment in 1919, to every ton that 
Germany had; the fact that we were 
going to have a tank on the front line 
for every 75. feet of the line in 1919; 
the fact that we would have thou
sands of batteries of guns where wedid not have a single one in 1918 
those facts had an influence on the 
German General Staff.
And, far from that money, those 
millions and billions of dollars wasted 
in an unnecessary preparation, I feeP 
that the fact that the money was spent 
and that that enormous output of 
munitions was ready, was the con
trolling factor in the weakening ot 
the German General Staff, and that 
it caused their message to the Kaiser 
that they were beaten, and that he 
must sue for peace. And the way I 
see it is that this money, instead of 
being wasted, can be written down ashaving .,aved the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of American men who 
would have been sacrificed had the. 
war continued another year.
I do not believe that we are going 
to be troubled with this loan. I look 
for at least 20,000,000 subscribers to 
the next loan.
We must let the people of the 
United States know why there is a> 
Fifth Loan, what the money went for, 
what it didand that is the most im
portant part of it, what it did. We 
mu&t tell them that it brought back 
two or three or four or five hundred 
thousand safe, live American boys, 
instead of having them buried in 
France. And I cannot conceive o! 
the American people failing to respond 
to that kind of an appeal.

Flore Rosalie Flapper was one of 
those cute, young things. Dressed to 
be seen she did not cause a per
ceptible strain on the eyes or the 
imagination. She talked too much, 
had studied French and had won a 
cup in a tennis tournament.
Flore had been raised among booze 
comedians, and at the age of 22 was 
permitted to leave the nursery and 
become a bashful debutante.
Her mother (the Mrs. Flapper, the 
one who had so nobly and patriotically 
collected the money to buy and do
nate a fire engine to Belgium), now 
taught Flore how to reject aspiring 
young suitors successfully, giving 
each one some encouragement and a 
rain check to be used when he could 
produce something besides Love. Un
fortunately, Jupiter Pluvius contract
ed the flu and Miss Flapper was in 
no great need of a rain check printer.
However, one bright summer 
morning, there appeared upon the 
matrimonial horizon one Cyril Geroncious Heller. He was a full mem
ber of Phi Tappa Key, had spent six 
years at the University of Siamhis 
favorite years being the Sophomore 
and Juniorand had established a

losing the dice. Incidentally, his 
father was awfully wealthy.

floundering out on the matrimonial 
horizon. But there is always Hope.

home, and we next see Cyril stagger-ST. PAULS CATHEDRAL| ing from the Teafull of ambition.

The Junior Prom
FEBRUARY 28
A story of originality and engross
ing qualities has been put into picture 
foijm by Clara Kimball Young in 
"Cheating Cheaters, the attraction 
which will be presented at the 
New Million Dollar Grand all next 
week, starting Monday morning, 
February 24. The photoplay is made 
from Max Marciens play of the same 
name, which has been a great success 
on;the speaking stage. Miss Young is 
supported by an all-star cast, includ
ing Anna Q. Nilsson, Jack 1-Iolt, Frank 
Cajnpeau. Tully Marshall, Frederick 
BuVton, Edwin Stevens, Mayrne Kelso, 
Nicholas Dunnew, Jess Singleton, 
Eleanor Hancock and W. A. Carroll. 
Allan 'Dawn directed and Kathryn 
Stwart prepared the scenario.
Cheating Cheaters will head 
a bill of the best motion pictures can 
provide. It will include a. Fox Sun
shine comedy of the uproarious kind, 
"Thp Musical Sneeze; a Burton 
Holmes travelogue, War Women of 
England; the Grand Novelette, of
fering numerous odd bits of motion 
picture photoplay collected here and 
there, Including more work of that 
new discovery, th "slow camera; 
and the Grand News Weekly, bringing 
scenes of interesting happenings from 
all parts of the world. A program of 
excellent, music by the symphony or
chestra, under Director David Broudy, 
is being arranged.
Miss Young is charming in "Cheat
ing Cheaters/ She enacts the role 
of Ruth Brockton, clever girl who be
comes head of a notorious band of 
crooks. Her charm of personality, 
her beauty, her acting ability, and 
her skill at selecting and wearing 
wonderful clothes, gives her a fasci
nation that is unsurpassed. The story 
of the picture is one of action and 
mystery, dealing with the activities 
of two bands of thieves. It allows 
Miss Young and her company un
usual use of their splendid histrionic 
qualities.
As head of her gang, Ruth estab
lishes a home in a fashionable section 
of New York, with the purpose of be
coming acquainted with the Palmer 
family, whose jewels are world fa
mous. There is a rumor of the 
proximity of Ferris, a famous detec
tive, so the Broclctons plan to work 
rapidly. Ruth obtains an invitation 
to spend the night with the Palmers, 
but instead of stealing the Palmer 
jewels, she discovers that they are 
paste, and that the Palmers theihselves are crooks and are planning to 
rob the supposedly wealthy Brockton 
family. The events that result are 
both thrilling and unusual. A big 
surprise comes when Ferris appears 
on the scene, and the story develops 
through a series of complications and 
exciting situations until the numer
ous problems that have arisen are 
solved. Of course, va romance de
velops, with Ruth in the principal 
feminine role, and it is declared to be 
the most charming love story in 
which Miss Young has ever acted.

organ will play throughout each day, 
and performances will be continuous

Owen Lovejoy, social worker and 
prominent secretary of the Child 
Labor Association, gave an interest
ing address on Tuesday, February 4, 
in the M. M. C. S. Assembly Hall, on 
the appauling facts about Child Labor 
in America. He particularly dwelt on 
the ignorance in rural communities.. 
In connection with this Mr. Lovejoy 
said thatdue largely to many teach
ers not getting a living Wage, a good 
portion of the country scliools 
throughout the United States are 
without teachers or with teachers 
who are utterly incompetent. Also 
compulsory education is not enforced 
in some districts, the parents being 
too stupid, poor or unfortunate to 
care. Contrary to general opinion, 
said the speaker, the majority of child 
factory workers 'are of pure Ameri
can stock, and here he referred par
ticularly to the mountaineers in some 
of the Southern States.
Then he told of visiting a factory 
town in the South, and of being 
awakened at 4:30, before dawn; of 
seeing the lights come up in the 
miserable little village houses, and at 
5:30 of seeing the little children pour 
down the hills to the factory, there 
to work at some stupid, monotonous 
job, till the whistles blew at G:30, an 
hour after sunset. There was no 
thought of education, far less of rec
reation.
Mr. Lovejoy also told of the Federal 
Child Labor Bill, which was declared 
unconstitutional by the Supreme 
Court of the United States, and of the 
new Federal Child Labor Bill, drafted 
in a different way, and now before 
Congress.
The speaker ended by making a 
plea to the colleges to become the 
leaders in social reform and progress.

Wednesday afternoon, in Room jt04, 
Industries, the Science Civils heard 
the first of four lectures to be given by 
representatives of the Barrett Com
pany.
The lectures aro of one-hour, dura
tion, and aro illustrated with slides 
and moving pictures.
This first lecture, was upon the con
struction of roads for war-time pur
poses. . The United States, we are 
fold, has no system of highways like 
the European countries, Those high
ways were the savior of France In the 
early days of the war when troops 
wore transported by motor lorries to 
tin' front, it would be impossible to 
transport troops or freight in this 
country by means of motor vehicles. 
We have the motors, but, oh! the 
roads!
We were then told what could be 
accomplished if the emergency de
manded it. In the large cantonments 
in the East, many miles of roads* had 
to be built in each camp. These roads 
had to be completed in ninety days. 
It. was found that tar macadam roads 
could be built the quickest, and that 
they were the most serviceable for 
the purposes to which they were to 
be put. These roads consist of a layer 
of three-inch stone; a layer .of sand 
which fills up the openings between 
the stones; a layer of inch-stone; and 
then a layer of Tarvia, which binds 
the substances and completes the road 
after chips have been spread over the 
tar. The road is then immediately 
thrown open to traffic.
The lecture was. interesting and in
structive. It would have been much 
more so if one had been able to see 
the moving pictures with any degree 
of accuracy. A great deal was left to 
ones imagination.
