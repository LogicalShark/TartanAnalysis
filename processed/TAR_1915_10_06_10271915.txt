TENTATIVE NANS 
FOR (ARNE DAY
Third Observance.Several New 
Features This Year. Many 
Guests Expected.
Carnegie Day this year marks the 
celebration of the eightieth birthday 
of our founders and also the fifteenth 
anniversary of the founding of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
Although it is not fifteen years ago 
since Tech opened Its doors to the 
first students it is fifteen years since 
the plans for the Institution was first 
commenced. The intervening time 
between the opening of the school 
and its first conception is possibly 
the most important time in the his
tory of the school, for it is due to 
the work done in this period that so 
much of the success of the school is 
due. And inasmuch as the anniver
sary this year marks the passing of 
the fifteenth milestone of the prog
ress of the school, special effort is 
being made by the committee in 
charge to make this the most success
ful of all Carnegie Days.
More than three thousand invita
tions have been extended to both 
local and out of town guests to par
ticipate in at this anniversary. The 
guests will include presidents of Uni
versities, colleges, and Technical 
Schools, and also distinguished per
sons who are interested in the field 
of technical education. Considerable 
effort is being made by the commit
tee to afford adequate entertainment 
to all the guests.
Special commemoration medals are 
being made for both the guests of the 
occasion and the students.
One of the main reatures of the 
occasion will be an address to be deContinued on Page 5

HIRAM TO BE IKE 
NEH VICTIM
Before a large crowd in the some
what disabled grandstands Grove 
City was decisively defeated in a 
rather uninteresting gamecaused by 
the visitors playing for time and their 
unorganized attack. They were the 
first on the field .and it seemed that a 
well-balanced struggle was imminent 
for these young giants averaged over 
ten pounds above our juvenile per
formers. However, the spectators 
were sadly disappointed for in the 
first few minutes of play it was evi
dent that speed was an unexpected 
and almost unknown quality with the 
visitors.
Line Stars.
From the first the line severely out
played their heavier opponents, were 
through on every play and always 
dependable and on the juup. The 
average spectator does not usually 
appreciate the importance and the 
skill, grit, and fight that is necessary 
in this department. It is with pleas
ure that we point to the work of the 
two guardsFletcher and Kelly 
whose work is the bright spot of the 
game. McFeaters, likewise played 
fast and furious and heady defense 
as did his partner Kutz on the oppo
site side of the line. Hellstrom un
doubtedly had his heavy opponents 
goat from first to last and featured 
in most every play. Lauer and Levy

play on the endsLauer handled the 
forward passes most effectively, mak
ing several gains and scoring.
Fletchers Thrilling Feat.
Shortly after the game was under 
way for the second quarter Grove 
City had failed to gain on three at
tempts on account of the excellent 
work of the line and called for a punt. 
The whole line was through and 
blocked the kick which sent the ball 
bounding towards their own goal 
amid a scramble of feet and arms. 
Suddenly one particular long arm shot 
out, scooped the spheroid from mid
air and a large mass was soon rolling 
toward the goal. This massive streak 
was soon recognized as good old 
Fletcher, who does most of his work 
on the bottom of the pile instead of 
in the focus of the lime-light. This 
resourcefulness and speed on the part 
of a guard is a most welcome discov
ery and theres no one we would 
rather see shine than the fellows who 
take usually the brunt of the work 
without the glory that is more an 
accompaniment of the other positions.

Perhaps once in the life of a plebe 
there comes the chance to show the 
fact that he has some true value. 
This chance was surely made the 
most of on last Friday evening.
The annual Plebe smoker, given by 
the Plebes of this school to the up
per classmen, was this year changed 
to an informal reception and dance. 
This was done so as to give the girls 
of the Design school a chance to be 
represented. And incidentally to 
give the upper classmen a way of be
coming acquainted with .the Plebe 
girls, who seem to be quite numerous 
this year, and also good looking.
A committee of eight were ap
pointed to manage this affair. This 
committee was composed of four men 
and four girls. Due to the present

Interesting Program.
Edison Day, October 21st, was 
celebrated on Friday, October 22nd, 
in the assembly room of the Indus
tries School. The exercises were 
held under the direction of the Avo 
Club, classes being dismissed at 2:30 
in order that the entire school might 
attend. The introductory address 
was to have been given by Dean 
Connelley, but as he was unavoid
ably detained he could not be present 
to deliver it. However, he made up 
for his absence later on in the pro
gram by an interesting talk appro
priate to the occasion. E. J. Carlson 
gave an interesting sketch of the life 
of the great inventor, followed by 
Mr. C. W. Ward, superintendent of

Hiram College will be a complete 
stranger in our midst next Saturday. 
Never before has a football team from 
the Ohio Institution played in Pitts
burgh, although our baseball teams 
have played on their field during the 
Ohio trips.
Consequently Carnegie is lining up 
against a rather unknown proposi
tion. Scouts from the Hiram-Geneva 
game and the game last week where 
Hiram won from Defiance 71-0, re
port a light but hard fighting team 
with two good ends, heavy tackles, a 
fast back field with a wonderful full
back, and a large variety of open 
plays. But most important of all is 
the fact that the Ohioans are under 
the impression that they are going 
to have a cinch with the Carnegie 
eleven and will walk away with our 
goat; hide, carcass, and wool. It is 
to be hoped that a large crowd will 
be on hand to view their disappoint
ment.
Our eleven is just hitting its stride 
and should be in perfect running or
der by the Pitt game. Coach Steffen 
is now bending all his efforts with 
that and the Case game in view. New 
plays are being tried out and the 
whole machine is being polished up. 
No one who has seen the team could 
fail to be impressed with the fact that 
Carnegie is going to surprise some 
one mighty hard before the season 
is over. The charging of the line, 
the speed of the backfield, and the 
interference has improved wonder
fully, and loud was the praise of all

THE CASE TRIP.
We do not feel it necessary to say 
much in reference to the Case trip, 
for we feel that every true Techite 
will do his best to help cheer the team 
to victory at this occasion. If there 
are any amongst us who do not har
bor a keen desire to be present at 
Cleveland November 6th, we do not 
feel it too broad a statement to say 
that such individuals are suffering 
from some form of ailment which is 
decidedly abnormal. Remember first 
of all you owe it to your school, to 
your team, to yourself to make every 
effort to take this trip. A team which 
is playing with the continual assur
ance of confidence resounding over 
the gridiron, in the form of loyal root
ing and wild cheers is far more able 
to bring victory from the camp of 
the enemy. And for this reason you 
owe it to your team to be at this 
game.
Aside from the viewpoint of loyal
ty, we might suggest that the pleasure 
of such a trip should be a welcome 
break in the every-day routine of 
school life. And this is one of the 
occasions which justifies a small out
lay on your part.
Assured that it is not only your 
duty to go to .Case, but also to your 
advantage, we know that Cleveland 
will see a record-breaking attendance 
of true Techites.
only between one or two men, as has 
been the method heretofore.
AS TO GROVE CITY.
We feel that the student body are 
heartily sick of seeing the brand "df 
athletics displayed by Grove City. As 
far back as we can remember contests 
with that institution have been mark
ed by roughness and unsportsmanship 
on their part. The spirit displayed 
by their team Saturday, who, when 
they found winning impossible, delib
erately tried to injure our players, 
can not be too strongly condemned. 
Last year the Grove City football 
game, although the easiest won, was 
the most costly df the season in in
juries, and it was only by lck that 
some of our players^ did not escape 
serious injury last Saturday. We 
find it hard to criticise some of our 
players for losing their tempers, as 
there certainly is a limit to human 
endurance.
Carnegie has this fall taken a pub
lic stand against an ethical breach of 
athletic principles. Let us take as 
decisive a stand against a practical 
display of dirty athletics. We desire 
no more of Grove City.
COMPETITIVE MANAGERSHIP.
The present system of electing man
agers of athletic teams, publications 
and clubs, with its multifarious de
tails, its incorrigible propensities 
toward corrupt politics, has been, and 
is, one of the non-progressive phases 
of our student life. This is the age 
of competitionan age when the 
man best for theplace usually obtains 
it. We have competition for our ath
letic teams, for our clubs, for the ediE T i -torial staffs of our college papers, blit 
we still have an old and inadequate 
system of electing managers. The 
efficiency of our athletics is due di
rectly to its competitive methods.
We do not mean to insinuate that 
the managerships in the school have 
not been well filled, but we believe 
that only by a system that shall per
mit the most efficient and most thor
oughly equipped man to get the posi
tion, will the care of managerial bur
dens be in the most efficient hands. 
We are not advocating a radical or 
untried propositiona proposal which 
could not be accepted here in Carne-. 
gie, for we believe that which has 
been most successful m our leading 
colleges, is sure to meet with the 
hearty approbation of the student 
body here. Competitive managerships, 
run on the same plan as our competi
tion for the staffs of the college pub
lications, is no longer an innovation 
but a part of the system in the man
agement of student activities in al
most a majority of our colleges. Let 
a number of men compete for a man
agerial position, instead of choosing
THE TECH STADIUM.
Owing to the record-breaking 
crowds that have been present for our 
last few football games and the in
creasing interest in Techs athletics 
by the Pittsburghers, we should turn 
ouf attention and the administrations 
to providing for this new .movement 
and influbc of interest. Since the . 
school was founded we have been 
looking at architectural sketches of 
thie proposed athletic field* with the 
good looking bridge, at the Morewood 
avenue entrance over the much talked 
of gymnasium and permanent housing 
of the Union, said club to. be the 
Holy of Holies for Tech spirit.
When we consider the wonderful 
housing and equipment of every other 
department of the school the present 
athletic department does not fit in 
with the general scheme. When a 
prospective student inspects the 
schools he is awed by its wonderful 
completeness of every other depart
ment but the physical training and to 
most wide-awake students, especially 
those athletically inclined, this is like 
a dash of cold water.
Our present gymnasium and ath
letic field are inadequate in all man
ners. The present grandstand is not 
as safe as it should be. It is about 
seven and one-half years old and the 
lumber from which it was built was 
second hand, so you can see that it is 
not in a very safe condition. True, 
it is being repaired but that does not 
eliminate possible collapse at any mo
ment. It would be a black eye to us 
to have any bad accident on our field.
It is a well known fact that people 
judge a school by the success of its 
athletic teams, if they are made up 
of bonafide members in good stand
ing in the school that they represent. 
Whether this sort of. judgment is very 
sound or not is another matter, but 
we do know that we have to be guid
ed by results.
ATHLETIC NOTES.
It was evident that the Grove City 
team were out to get Sunny Kesner. 
One got rather accustomed to look
ing back after the play was over to 
see how many of the Crimson play
ers were piled on top of him or whe
ther some big linesman was not en
deavoring to work the strangle hold. 
Several times after tackled the crowd 
expected to see Kesner carried off 
as the Grove City men would un
intentionally fall on his head, but 
luck was, with Sunny Saturday.
Even Whitey Hellstrom grew 
peeved.
Tech only punted once when Kes
ner got off a long high one in the 
third quarter.
After Grove City scored their 
touchdown the Scrubs went to work 
in earnest and showed up excellently. 
McSorley ran the team well, using 
Brunwasser for long gains through 
the line.
The newspapers at last realized 
Sunday that in Kelley and Fletcher
we had two guards that are largely 
responsible for the gains that our 
backs have been making through the 
opposing lines. Both drew1 a large 
amount of praise; in the writeups.
It was with relief that every one 
saw Altdoerfer walk off the field 
after alighting on the back of his 
neck. It looked at first as though 
the big fullback was laid out for 
good. A weeks rest will bring him 
around in first-class shape; Kutzs 
knee is also bothering him again, 
though it doesnt show in those splen
did kickoffs he has been producing.
West Virginia is certainly acquir
ing some reputation in this district 
for unclean athletics. Their coach 
withdrew the team, from the field 
Saturday just as Washington and 
Lee were about to score the winning 
touchdown during the last minute 
of the game.
Basketball practice started Monday 
with a squad of forty men reporting. 
This augurs well for a successful sea
son. Dr. Marks has taken charge of 
the squad for the present.

1915 BOARD OF CONTROL
MEETS FOR FIRST TIME.
Officers Elected.McCullochs Ac
tion in W. Va. Game Supported. 
Graduate Manager Discussed.
The first regular monthly meeting 
of the 1915 Board of Athletic Control 
was at 8:00 P. M. in the Science 
Study Room last Wednesday, Oc
tober 20, 1915.
A -revision of the constitution was 
planned. Filling the vacancy caused 
by the resignation of Mr. Fred E. 
Foster as Graduate Manager, was dis
cussed; this office will be filled at the 
meeting of the Board this evening. 
Mr. Schwerin was elected Track Man
ager for the coming season. Other 
athletic managers and their assist
ants will be chosen this evening.
The most important business to 
come before the board was the con
sideration of the position of grad
uate manager in charge of athletic 
schedules arid student activities. The 
sentiment of the board was largely in 
favor of a full time man, and the Stu
dent Activities Committee, which met 
on the same night, decided to support 
the engagement of a full time man. 
The part time man was thought not to 
be sufficient for the requirements of 
the office. It seems that John R. Gear
hart, an electrical engineering gradu
ate of 1913, is the only full time man 
with whom they have yet gotten in 
touch who will accept the full time 
job. Gearhart was cheer-leader and 
baseball captain while in -school, so 
that he is well fitted for the job. In 
the course of the evening a motion 
supporting the action of Director of 
Athletics McCulloch in canceling the 
West Virginia game on account of 
Rodgers^ ineligibility was passed.
The election of officers resulted as 
follows:
W. F. McCaughey, President.
J. M. Miller, Vice President.
F. A. Finlay,' Secretary. . , 
W. P. Lippincott, Treasurer (elect
ed last year).

B. & O. ENGINE ENTERTAINS 
CROWD.
Engine Atlantic is the Oldest in 
Existence.
Through the courtesy of the B. & 
O. Railroad, a rare treat was given 
the Carnegie Tech students, when the 
antique engine Atlantic was ex
hibited before a large crowd of spec
tators from the Tech-Grove City foot
ball game. The announcement of the 
exhibition was made between the 
halves of the game and as a result a 
goodly portion of the on-lookers 
wended their way over the new ath
letic field and down into Panther 
Hollow where the primitive engine 
had been placed on a siding. Unfor
tunately one of the gears were lost 
on the way out from town and it was 
impossible to run the engine. With 
this gear missing the engine went 
through the antics of a mule when the 
throttle was opened. Since there was 
no connection to the driving wheels 
the big vertical pistons caused the 
engine to rear violently up and down. 
With a new gear in place another ex
hibition was given on Monday, with 
a little better success. On Saturdays 
trip from Allegheny, although eightyfour years old, the engine maintained 
a speed of fifteen fniles an hour almost 
all the way. It pulled a passenger 
coach of the earliest type.
The principal dimensions of the en
gine are: length over all, 14 ft.; height 
over all, 14 ft.; steam pressure, 50 lbs.; 
cylinder stroke, 18 in.; driving rod 
stroke, 28 in.; track gauge, 56^ in. 
standard.
The Atlantic was the first loco
motive to haul a train into Washing
ton, D. C., over the B. & O. Railroad. 
This trip was made in 1834 and Presi
dent Jackson and many other notables 
were at the station when it arrived. 
In 1861, the Atlantic hauled Presi
dent Lincoln from Baltimore to 
Washington for his inauguration. In 
1882 it was replaced by a more mod
ern type and has since been used for 
exhibition purposes only.

The first Choral Club Meeting was 
held on Tuesday at 3:30. Between 65 
and 70 people were there. This seems 
to be a very good beginning, but the 
leader, Mr. Weber, is looking for still 
more members. So if anyone has yet 
the desire to join, be assured they will 
be given a hearty welcome. The club 
will meet every Tuesday afternoon 
in the M. M. C. S. Assembly Hall at 
3:30. Songs are being practiced for 
Carnegie Day.
REGULAR ASSEMBLY.
At the regular Assembly on Wed
nesday for upper classmen, Dean 
Breed gave a short talk on Disci
pline. She pointed out the necessity 
of winning fairly and honestly what 
we are striving for; also that since we 
had so far a clean slate let no one 
mar it by infringing on the rules of 
honesty and uprightness in school 
work. It is better not to have a thing 
at all, if not obtained by straight-for
ward methods. The Dean also men
tioned that fact that the combinations 
on the lockers are to USE. So learn 
your combinations, girls, and use 
them every day.
GUILD DANCE.
Girls, do you like to dance? Have 
you ever grumbled and asked, Why 
doesnt someone have a dance? If 
so, come to the Recreation Hall, Fri
day night, October 29th, to the Hal
loween Dance of the Guild. It is 
only 75 cents and is a small sum con
sidering the good time you will have. 
Programs will be made out before
hand and everyone will be sure to 
have a wonderful evening.
The proceeds will be for charity 
and will be used by the Guild in its 
work this winter. Help the Guild 
and incidentally enjoy yourself at the 
same time. Ask your man, NOW!
PARTY FOR THE SENIORS.
Friday afternoon in the Recreation 
Hall, the Plebes entertained the Sen
iors at a party which showed the re
sourcefulness and ability of the
youngest class of all. Two of the 
girls sang, Miss Phyllis McMarlin and 
Miss Margaret Brooks, and their 
music was greatly enjoyed by all 
present. Dancing was general most 
of the afternoon. French Blind Mans 
Buff was also played. In this game 
each girl is given a number. In the 
center of the ring stands a blind-fold
ed girl. She calls out several num
bers and they must change places 
while the girl in the center endeavors 
to catch them. It proved quite ex
citing.
Later ice cream, cake, and wafers 
were served and all the Seniors cer
tainly had a most enjoyable time and 
wish to thank the Plebes for the pleasafternoon. Miss Winifred Linn, tem
porary chairman for the Plebes, and 
her committee deserve great credit 
for the manner in which the details 
were arranged.
ALUMNAE MOVIE BENEFIT

ized as clear profit. This affords great 
pleasure to the girls because the en
tertainment was to raise money for 
the annual scholarships which the 
Association provides. Everything was 
donated and the girls wish to take 
this opportunity to thank anyone who 
contributed in any way to the suc
cessful outcome of the evening.
The committee who attended to the 
details and who deserve much credit 
is: Helen Anderson, chairman, Mar
garet McClintock, Katherine Dermitt, 
Marion Redenbaugh, Eliza Dickey, 
Eleanor Law, Edna Stoebener and 
Marguerite Law.
HIRAM NEXT VITIM
Continued from Page 1 
the Grove City game.
One of the most pleasing thoughts 
to the students is the remembrance 
of the showing of the second string 
men. In Brunwasser we have a full 
back who can be depended upon for 
a steady ground gainer. He hits the 
line hard and low and plays a good 
defensive game. McSorley has also 
developed wonderfully and ran the 
team Saturday like a veteran. Smith, 
Bollinger, and Garrett all played 
steady gamesr keeping their feet es
pecially well in a broken field. Cupid 
Young must also be mentioned f.or 
the hard and steady game he played 
at guard when he replaced Fletcher.
ACCESSION OF JOHN HENRY 
MacCRACKEN, L. L. D., AS 
PRESIDENT OF LA
FAYETTE COLLEGE.
The inaugural exercises at the ac
cession of John Henry MacCracken, 
L.L.D., as President of Lafayette Col
lege, is an occasion of marked import
ance to the educational realm. More 
than three hundred college presidents, 
Deans, delegates, alumni and guests 
from all sections of the United1 States 
were present at the inaugural dinner 
given at the Hotel Karldon, October 
nineteenth and twentieth.
The undernamed responded to 
toasts:
John Grier Hibben, L.L.D., President
of Princeton University.
John Huston Finley, L.L.D., Presi
dent of University of the State of 
New York.
George Morris Phillips, L.L.D., Prin
cipal of the West Chester Normal 
High School.
Harry B. Hutchins, L.L.D., President 
of the University of Michigan. 
Ethelbert D. Warfield, L.L.D., Pres
ident of Wilson College.
Walt M. Emery, M.A., Vice President 
of Lehigh University.
Samuel Black McCormick, L.L.D., 
Chancellor of the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Charles Alexander Richmond, D. D., 
L.L.D., Chancellor of Union Uni
versity.
Elbert H. Gary, Sc.D., chairman of 
U. S. Steel Corporation, spoke at 
length with regard to the Relation
ship of Capital to Workmen. Mr. 
Gary gave voice to a fervent expres
sion in his belief in the wisdom of the 
workingman.
Thomas Hastings, the well known 
architect of New York City, was con
ferred with the honorary degree of 
Doctor of Laws. Winston Churchill 
was also conferred with the Doctor 
of Laws, and distinguished himself 
at the luncheon by an astute address 
upon The General Tendencies of 
American Civilization, emphasizing 
the criterion of the Anglo-Saxon 
work in favor of individualism, free
dom and equal opportunity. He also 
scored an excellent point when he so 
keenly emphasized the fact that col
lectivism and centralization, no mat
ter how fit for the German Empire, 
was in no manner fit for us.
All of the. speakers spoke of the 
charming site of Lafayette College 
and often referred to it as. Lovely 
Lafayette. These buildings, so clev
erly located,, rest upon a hill whieh 
overlooks the river and the New Jer
sey hills.
Probably the most touching inci
dents of the whole exercises was the 
inaugural prayer offered by Henry 
Mitchell MacCracken, D.D., L.L.D., 
Chancellor Emeritus of the New York 
University, the aged father of La
fayettes new president. This fervent 
invocation for the success of his son 
in gathering his new duties was hearttouching.
One, if not' the most artistic inci
dents of the exercises, was the torch 
light parade. Here the varied col
ored caps and gowns under the glare 
of the blazing torches of the immense 
gathering afforded a pi-cture long to 
be vivid in the; memory of. those pres
ent..
Mr. Bossange, Secretary of the 
School of Applied Design, repre
sented this institution at the exer
cises.
Following is a copy of the resolu
tion sent to* Lafayette College:
The Faculties of the Carnegie In

Stye artatt5
The names of the winners of the 
two scholarships which are awarded 
annually to members of the Middle 
class of the School of Applied Indus
tries, were recently announced.
These scholarships are awarded on 
a basis of merit for scholastic record 
maintained during the first year, per
sonality, conduct, part taken in activi
ties, and finally, need. The commit
tee, consisting of members of the fac
ulty, whose duty it was to decide the 
winners of the scholarships were con
fronted with a very difficult task, 
since there were seven men in the 
running for the prizes, all standing 
very close in the requirements.
After very careful consideration the 
following awards were made. The 
first scholarship, consisting of $100 in 
cash and refund of tuition for the year 
1915-1916, was equally divided be
tween Cronise K. Koontz, Waynes
boro, Pa., and Raymond J. Wean, 
Pottstown, Pa. The second scholar
ship, consisting of refund of tuition 
for the year of 1915-1916, was award
ed to Nicholas Tramonte, Hartford, 
Conn. The following men were given 
honorable mention: W. H. Payne, B.
C. Speicher, H. W. Miller and A. M. 
Pringle.
We were all greatly pleased to re
ceive our first monthly reports, void 
absolutely (?) of Ps, Fs, Rs and Ds.

the cause of Woman Suffrage.

gameon November 6th and the im
portance of having as many Tech men 
as possible in Cleveland on that date, 
to help cheer our great team on to 
victory.
The Middle class held a meeting 
last Thursday afternoon.. W. D. 
Greene, Printing, NAIV was elected an 
associate editor of The Thistle. Next 
year the office of editor-in-chief of 
The Thistle will be his and Green is 
indeed a capable man for an office of 
such responsibility.
Last Thursday evening, 45 members 
of the Pittsburgh Builders Exchange 
visited the Industries School and 
were shown through the building by 
members of the Upper Building Con
struction, class.
Dean Connelley spoke on Thurs
day evening at the Prosperity Ban
quet of the Duquesne Light Co.s 
chapter of the National Electric 
Lighting Association, which was held 
in Kaufmanns store. His subject 
was Prosperity, the result of prop
erly investing our time.
On Monday evening, October 18th, 
Mr. Ffouts gave a very interesting 
talk to the members of the Junior 
Order of American Mechanics at their 
rooms on Fifth avenue, his subject 
being, The Young American,
Merker (in Assembly): We will 
open the meeting by singing No-. 1.

velopment of the Edison storage bat
tery.
The next number on the program 
was an exceedingly interesting talk 
by Mr. T. B. A. David, who was as
sociated with Mr. Edison in his 
earlier work. Mr. David told of 
many interesting and amusing inci
dents in the early career of the Wiz
ard of Menlo Park. R. W. Cost 
gave a very interesting account of 
the development of the incandescent 
lamp. This portion of the program 
was concluded by Mr. Calderwood, 
whose remarks were in the nature of 
encouragement for those who are 
just starting in their careers, to as
pire to do as great things as have al
ready been accomplished. He com
mended highly those who had charge 
of the affairs of the day. The audi
ence was then entertained with a 
few reelsof Edison Photoplays. 
Owing to lack of time the program 
had to be cut short, but the club 
hopes to present the remaining por
tion at an early date.

and our boys will have to extend 
themselves to the limit and open up 
their whole game for the first time 
this fall.
The round trip fare will be $3.70, 
which certainly will be within reach 
of everyone, at least within pawning 
reach. We go by special street cars 
to New Castle wher the whole body 
will parade through the business sec
tion of the city behind the band as 
they go from one car line to the 
other. More special cars will carry 
the crowd to Youngstown, Ohio, 
where a special train will be boarded 
for Cleveland. The total running 
time will be four hours and a half, 
the probable time of arrival in Cleve
land being twelve-thirty.
Notices have been posted in each 
school asking for the signatures of 
those intending to take the trip. 
These should be signed at once in 
order to give those in charge some 
idea of how many to prepare for. 
Tickets will be placed on sale in the 
Bursars office on Friday for the 
round trip to Youngstown, the price 
being one dollar. Tickets for the 
remainder of the trip are to be pur
chased by the students at the rail
road ticket office in that city for 
$2.70.
Arrangements are to be made so 
that anyone may return either on 
Saturday or Sunday, according to the 
state of their pocketbook. Those de
siring to return by some other route 
may purchase a one-way fare for 
$2.35, which is ninety-five cents 
cheaper than the regular railroad 
fare.
A special car will be reserved for 
those desiring to have the pleasure of 
the companionship of one of the fair 
sex. The price of a ticket in this 
car will be $4.25, each holder beingguaranteed a seat.
Half the style o a tailored suit is

tute and students are urged to visit 
there before the closing date, Novem
ber 23.
Three of the most noted of todays 
artists visited the Design School last 
week and expressed a marked sur
prise at its beauties, and a keen in
terest in its future. Mr. William Merth 
Chase was titled at a recent banquet 
as the Daddy of American Painting, 
and he may correctly be remembered 
as the instructor of the present gen
eration of our painters. Mr. Chase 
spoke here recently upon the cubist 
and futurist art.
Mr. Charles W. Hawthorn is an 
American painter whose school at 
Provincetown, Mass., is known the 
world over. He is represented in all 
big American museums and has taken 
high honors in current exhibitions. 
As well known as he is for his paint
ings, he is even more widely known 
for his golf. . S
Mr. William S. Robinson is repre
sented in the Carnegie Institute by a 
permanent collection of landscape 
paintings and is a teacher of great in
fluence upon American art.

exciting time getting together. Con
ferring with a member of the girls 
committee was apt to be seen by the 
ever watchful eye of the Sophomores 
whose fondness for giving haircuts 
sets terror into the heart of every 
Plebe.
The idea of giving a dance for the 
entire school and faculty, instead of 
the usual smoker, was original with 
the Plebes. The idea was at first 
disapproved of by a few, but the ma
jority thought it a good plan, and it 
was pushed forward into complete 
success.
A four-piece orchestra, under the 
direction of Mr. Wm. F. Diehl, a 
Design senior, furnished the most ex
cellent music. Cigars and cigarettes 
were placed at the disposal of the 
men, while there were also refresh
ments of sweet cider and doughnuts.
Because of the non-arrival of the 
favors, it was necessary to drop the 
reception part of the program, which 
was much regretted by the commit
tee. It was also regretted that the 
date was set for the same night as 
the M. M. C. Alumni movies, as there 
was a possibility of it interfering with 
their success.
The usual good time, where there is 
excellent music, a good floor, and 
plenty of room, was had. And the 
Freshmen were surely made happy 
when told by those present, that the 
entire affair was the most delightful 
ever given by a first year class of the 
school.
DINNER FOR DR. BRASHEAR.
Plans are being formulated for a 
dinner which is to be tendered Dr. 
John A. Brashear at Memorial Hall 
on November 24. Dr. Brashear 
(Uncle John) is a man well known 
to the old students of Tech and, be
sides being one of the most popular 
men connected with Tech, has the dis
tinction of being named by Governor 
Brumbaugh as the most distinguished 
citizen of Pennsylvania. The bulk of 
the entertainment for the dinner is 
in the hands of Dramatic students of 
the Design School. Some assistance 
is being given by Pitt student^, how
ever. At the* present 'writing the na
ture of the entertainment is not 
known. A more detailed account will 
follow in a later issue of The Tartan.

influence will be exerted by such an

Too much praise cannot be show

outfit. Their gnral play Saturday 
was a repetition of their work against 
Allegheny College a week ao, and 
although the strength of Grove City 
does not compare with that of the 
Methodists, Tech showed the differ

No, Philburt, I am not a-arguing with you. 
P m just a-telling you
when you want a real smoke, get behind a pipeful of 
Tuxedo and watch all the big and little Worries that 
have been a-besieging you, evacuate their trenches 
and make a rushin advance to the rear. Those fragrant 
whiffs of Tux make them feel too joyful  no sclfrespecting Worry can stand for that.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
The combination of the best smoking-tobacco leaf in the world and the best method ever discovered for refining 
and mellowing tobacco puts Tuxedo in a class by itself.
Kentuckys ripest, mildest Burley 
leaf, when treated by the original 
Tuxedo Process loses every trace of bite  develops a wonderfully 
pleasing fragrance and flavor that 
are not found in any other tobacco.
No other manufacturer knows 
the Tuxedo Process; thats why 
no imitator ever equals Tuxedo!

scrubs did not accumulate points as 
readily as the varsity had been amass
ing them, but were holding their op
ponents in a creditable fashion. Grove 
City at the same time took advantage 
of her weaker foes and held them for 
the remainder of the period without 
a score.
Tech Subs Also Shine.
However, with the beginning of the 
final period, the scrubs started a 
stronger offensive, and rolled up 19 
more points although they scored 
through a longer combination of 
plays. Tech started towards her op
ponents goal posts, when Bollinger 
intercepted a forward pass from Pen
man. By a series of line plays, the 
locals gradually worked the ball up 
to Grove Citys 10-yard line, from 
where Brunwasser on two tries, car
ried the ball over, Lauer kicking goal.
Grove City scored their only points 
of the game a few minutes later. First, 
a forward pass from Friedly to Al
bright, gained six yards, then a for
ward pass, Thorn to Friedly netted 
25 yards. Techs chances for a shut
out were sent a-glimmering, when still 
another forward worked by the same 
two resulted in the visitors touch
down, Tech kicked off, but the vis
itors were unable to penetrate the 
locals line, and were held for downs. 
Tech then went on one straight 
stretch from the 34-yard line across 
her opponents goal, Brunwasser car
rying it over from the 15-yard mark. 
Lauer scored the final touchdown as 
the result of a freak play for which 
the visitors were responsible. Thorn 
was about to make a heave for a for
ward pass but before be had a chance, 
Kelly had broken through the line and 
was about to block his attempt. 
Thorn, to evade the Tech guard, ran 
back about 10 yards, and then threw, 
Lauer intercepting and taking the 
ball over.

EAST DORM DEFEATS WEST.
Saturday morning the dormitories 
played their second game, which re
sulted in a victory for East, 12 to 0. 
The game was well played except for 
the fumbles which were made.
No scoring occurred until the third 
period, when Russell, of East, picked 
up a fumble on Wests 20-yard line 
and ran for a touchdown. The second 
touchdown for East resulted in the 
latter part of the last quarter. West 
had worked the ball well down the 
field by a series of well executed for
ward passes and threatened to score 
a touchdown, when a fumble caused 
them to lose the chance. Then with 
about four minutes to play, East car
ried the ball the entire length of the 
field for another score, a long end run 
by Crandall, a recovered punt by 
Ward, and another end run by Wilson 
brought the ball over the line. The 
try at goal was missed.
Ward, Furber, and Crandall were 
the stars for East, while DeLavan 
and Alcorn played the best game for 
West.
