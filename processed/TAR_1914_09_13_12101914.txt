"SAFETY EIRSI
L. H. BURNETT SPEAKS TO 
SCIENCE STUDENTS.
The Safety First movement of the 
U. S. Steel Corporation was the sub
ject of the Wednesday morning lec
ture to the Science School by Mr. L. 
H. Burnett, assistant to the president 
of the Carnegie Steel Company. The 
talk, which dealt with the organiza
tion of the movement and the results 
obtained was illustrated with many 
slides.
In opening, Mr. Burnett explained 
that the U. S. Steel Corporation does 
not own or operate any plants, but 
that it is the one big stockholder in 
all of its under plants. Between the 
time of formation of this billion dol
lar and a half holding company in 1899 
and 1906, the numerous accidents oc
curring in their mills led to the start 
of the safety movement as an organi
zation at the latter date.
The smallest units of the plan are 
the workmens committees which 
serve two or three months, and are 
in charge of the safety of their own 
department. Occasionally they visit 
other departments and thus stimulate 
friendly rivalry. In this manner the 
workmen are kept interested, which is 
one of the biggest factors in the suc
cess of the movement.
Going up the scale, there comes 
each departmental committee of two 
or three foremen and the head of the 
department, which supervises the work 
of the workmens committees, next 
the plant committees with their paid 
inspectors, then the company com
mittees with monthly meetings, the 
corporation committees, and finally 
the permanent New York Bureau of 
Safety, Sanitation and Welfare.
The results of the campaign as 
shown by the slides were of several 
classes; safety proper, abolition of 
dangerous practices, cleanliness, first 
aid, sanitation, and social work. The 
first class dealt with the safeguarding 
of machines, the red disk as the uni
versal danger signal, and other safe
ty devices. The slides showing the 
remarkably clean and sanitary con
dition of the millyards, buildings, hos
pitals, and communities as a whole, 
evidenced the great advance of 
the. movement. The swimming and 
wading pools of the works play
grounds certainly looked inviting as 
they were thrown on the screen.
It is just as much a part of the 
plant superintendents business to see 
after the welfare not only of his men

PLAY DUQUESNE UNIVERSITY 
FRIDAY NIGHT.
One of the most important meets of 
the year, the Press Meet, will be held 
in Duquesne Garden on Saturday, De
cember 12. The meet promises to be 
one of greatest interest and Carnegie 
is entering a team which should make 
a fair score. As a result of the cross
country teams defeat on Thanksgiv
ing Day by P. A. A., our fellows will 
be out for revenge next Saturday and 
from the good form which the team 
has been displaying they give every 
indication of gaining their purpose.
The Press Meet, combined with the 
P. A. A. Meet for the A. A. U. champ
ionship, which takes place in March, 
are the two most important indoor 
meets on the schedule.
The Plaid competitors in the com
ing meet are entered as follows:
Mile Handicap  Rieser, Walker, 
Moore, Handelman, Krebs, Cary, Bentu, Bayard, and De Young.

Carnegie will suffer a great disad
vantage in the absence of one of their 
most valuable men, Dunseith. His 
absence is caused by an injured nerve 
in his leg, received in the cross-country meet with P. A. A. on Thanksgiv
ing. The injury, however, is not ser
ious and he will be able to run again 
after the Christmas recess.
Friday night at 8 P. M., an All Car
negie Plebe team will meet the Du
quesne University Freshmen five. 
This is the first opportunity that the 
basketball enthusiasts have of seeing 
a regular game. The Plebe team 
will be picked from the Varsity can
didates in the Plebe class and will 
probably include such good men as 
Crawford, Slater, Seagraves, Craig, 
Ferber, Holzworth and Green. A 
dance will follow the game. Dont 
forget, Friday at 8 P. M. Student 
tickets will be honored for admission.
BUNDLE DAY AT CARNEGIE.
Next Monday, December 14, there 
will be a general collection of all kinds 
of spare clothing, for the relief of war 
sufferers. Rooms will be designated 
at which all donations can be left. 
Every student is requested to put all 
his or her surplus clothing in a bun
dle, and bring it to school. All clubs 
and fraternities are urged to make a 
collection. Watch the bulletin boards 
for particulars as to rooms, etc.
NEW S(HEDULE 
IS ANNOUNCED
BASKETBALL MEN HARD AT 
WORK.
There will be a luncheon of the 
New York State Club at the Schenley 
Friday evening, December 11th. All 
New York State men are requested to 
attend. Assessment, 50 cents.
Last week closed the first session of 
real basketball practice. Now that 
football season is over, all the men 
are beginning to report to Coach 
Marks and a good sized squad is out; 
in fact the squad has been so large 
that it was found necessary to sub
divide it. About twenty of the men 
are reporting for practice on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday, while the re
maining fifteen are being drilled on 
Tuesday and Thursday. It is a little 
early to make any predictions about 
the season yet, the prospects for a 
successful team are good, judging 
from the squad. There are quite a few 
large, fast men who have a lot of bas
ketball sense. Hines, Meredith, Craw
ford, Seagraves, Curtis, Henning, 
Levy, Slater, Green, Craig and Kreid
er have been showing the best form 
of late and give promise of forming 
a nucleus of a good team.
Manager Boyer has announced a 
tentative schedule for the coming sea
son. Several changes are expected to 
be made and two or three games will 
no doubt be added to the present 
list. There ar seventeen games 
scheduled at present, nine of which 
are to be played at the Field House 
while two others, the Pitt and Westinghouse games abroad, will be played 
at places where it will be possible for 
the Tech adherents to see the con
tests. The management hopes to ar
range the matter so that there will be 
a dance after each game. This is a fea
ture that makes the basketball game 
enjoyable affairs and which serves 
to bring the alumni back to Tech. It 
is hoped that the dances will be con
ducted on a sound and reasonable 
basis in order that everything may be 
made as pleasant as possible for all.
The team makes three trips, one 
into Ohio, when Manitoba and Musk
ingum will be met; a norther trip, in
cluding Grove City, Allegheny and 
Hiram, and a trip east to meet Juniata 
at Huntingdon. In previous years, 
the team usually played Penn State on 
the same trip, but not so this year. 
Manager Boyer has been unable to 
arrange a suitable date with State and 
as a result no game has been scheduled. 
It is regretable that we must break 
our relation with the Center County 
institution.

PITTSBURGH, PA., DEC. 10, 1914
THE POOR SERVICE AT THE 
BEANERY.
If patience is a virtue, we are be
coming very iniquitous, judging by 
the alarming proportions our impa
tience regarding the service at the 
Beanery is assuming. After watchfully 
waiting six weeks we have been able 
to perceive no improvement in the 
rapidity of that service. At the begin
ning of the school year, the Seniors 
attempted to enforce a regulation re
quiring the Plebes to wait a definite 
length of time at the noon hours be
fore obtaining their meals, in order to 
afford the upperclassmen and faculty 
the opportunity to secure their lunch
es without the inconvenience of stand
ing in a long line. The plan was being 
successfully worked out when faculty 
pressure practically demanded its 
withdrawal, not, however, without the 
very fair assurance on the part of the 
faculty members in charge that imme
diate efforts would be made to facili
tate the Beanery service. On the 
strength of that promise we would 
like to inquire in the interest of all 
those concerned, the reasons for no 
manifest improvement in the rapidity 
of the frequently mentioned Beanery 
service. If the present method of giv
ing out lunches cannot be bettered, 
the regulation proposed by the Seniors 
should be re-enforced.
ARE YOU ONLY A GRIND?
We believe in originality, but so do 
hundreds of others in our position. 
We frequently happen upon editor
ials by our contemporaries which 
phrase in better style than our own, 
pertinent comments on undesirable 
conditions existing in some particular 
college. In such cases, we do not hesi
tate to quote our fellow editors and to 
give them the credit they deserve, es
pecially when the faults they criti
cize are evident at Carnegie. The fol
lowing editorial from the Thanks
giving issue of The Fulcrum of the 
Armour Institute of Technology is 
the kind of article to which reference 
has just been made. It should be 
seriously considered by many Car
negie Tech students including, it is 
sad to relate, an undue number of 
Seniors.
There is an element here at college, 
altogether too large, and so exclusive 
that to reach them is a problem more 
difficult than any of Dr. Campbells 
Calculus stickers. They never go 
to Rooters Association meetings or 
class-meetings, which they are really 
obliged to attend, and in fact can only 
be found in the class room and some
times at assemblies. They slide 
around the halls, trying to keep from 
being observed, afraid that some one 
will speak to them and ask them to do 
something. And they are not all 
freshmen either, nor yet sophomores. 
Though the word may be a strong 
one, we do not hesitate to call them 
contemptible, for their motive is a sel
fish one in that they are trying, (for 
they do not succeed) to profit at the 
expense of their fellows. While the 
latter are devoting a proper part of 
their time to athletics, clubs, publica
tions and other activities, the pikers, 
to use a very appropriate expression, 
are grinding along, trampling their 
fellow-students in the scholastic mud 
by their concentrated efforts.
Now, who are these silent grey 
ones? We venture to say that you 
could not name two off-hand. But 
take the list of the members of your 
class and see how many of the names 
you can correlate with the faces of 
their owners. See how many really 
have their names spoken by a class
mate. And, most important of all, 
consider yourself. Are you doing 
your part? Do your friends know you 
by a term other than the shark? 
Do your classmates speak of you, if 
they do at all, in terms of fellowship 
and friendship, or in a sneering way 
with a gesture of impatience? In 
other words, are you known by your 
classmates outside of the classroom, 
and have you given cause for them 
to know you so? Ask yourself these 
questions, answer them honestly, and 
see if you are satisfied. If you are 
not, bestir yourself and get into the 
spirit of things. Do something besides 
grind. Above all kick in and make a 
noise:lend a hand!
LECTURES ON SAFETY FIRST
Continued from Page 1 
but also of the community in which 
he lives, as it is to make good steel, 
remarked the speaker in regard to 
the effects of the campaign. The 
safety movement is responsible not 
only for making equipment and 
plants safe, but it has improved 
the community where the workmen 
live. This increases the value of the 
workman to his employer, so that the 
movement is far from being a char
ity; but it is a business project, pure 
and simple.
According to the best calculations, 
the safety movement has resulted in
the prevention of 11,704 serious and 
fatal accidents, which is certainly 
worth while. In closing, Mr. Bur
nett spoke thus: The time is com
ing when the mans record in safety 
and welfare of his men will have just 
as much to do with his promotion as 
his ability to make good steel.
DEATH OF ALUMNUS.
Word was received Monday of the 
death of William F. Burkhart, of the 
class of 1911, Night Design, at Greensburg, Penna. Mr. Burkhart has been 
employed up to his illness with Pal
mer, Hornbostel and Jones, of New 
York. He was one of the oldest stu
dents of the School of Applied Design 
and had given promise of becoming 
one of the Institutes most brilliant 
graduates.

BUREAU OF 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
As the Christmas vacation ap
proaches, it is requested that all who 
desire work for that period keep in 
constant touch with the office. This 
will facilitate the apportioning of all 
work which comes to the attention of 
the Bureau and will make it easier to 
put the applicant in touch with the 
job for which he is best equipped.
The official bulletin board of the 
Bureau has been placed in the outer 
office and will be used for announce
ments concerning employment. No
tices will be placed on it from time to 
time describing available positions.
Oakland, Dec. 2, 1914. 
Students of Carnegie 
Technical Schools;
The Oakland Board of Trade, in 
meeting assembled, desires me to ex
press its appreciation and thanks to 
the students of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology for their aid in mak
ing successful the recent Halloween 
celebration. The ready response to 
the call; the admirable showing of the 
student body in the celebration, and 
the get-together-for-Oakland spirit 
exhibited received well merited praise.
This helpful attitude and hearty co
operation that has marked the Tech 
men since the Schools inauguration is 
deeply gratifying to the Board, and 
this recent example further indicates 
the spirit of neighborly good-will in 
our own Oakland district.
Yours very truly,
CHAS. H. CHANCE, 
Chairman.

CONTRIBUTION OF A STUDENT 
FROM INDIA.
Among the many students of Car
negie, there is one who hails from the 
far off land of India. In his search 
after knowledge he has traveled from 
his home in Calcutta through France 
and England to Scotland, and finally 
to America. He has studied in the 
university in Calcutta, in the Univer
sity of Glasgow, and now he is com
pleting his education here in the engi
neering school at Tech. This young 
man, Bivuty-Vushon Mukherji by 
name, is a countryman of the famous 
Hindu poet, Rabindranath Tagore, 
who in 1913 was proclaimed the great
est poet of his age when he was 
awarded the Nobel Prize For Litera
ture. Mr. Mukherji, unlike many 
scientists, is a lover of poetry and an 
ardent admirer of his distinguished 
countryman. During his few spare 
moments he has found time to trans
late a number of Tagores short poems 
and has been kind enough to offer 
them to us for publication. We are 
exceedingly grateful to Mr. Mukherji 
for the opportunity he has afforded us 
to print material of real literary 
merit.
Translated from the original Bengali 
of Radindranath Tagore, author of 
Gifanjali, Nobel Prizeman in Lit
erature, 1913.

Golden Bengal is the pet name of

THE GUILD DANCE.
DRAMATIC CLUB.
Instead of the Burglar that Failed 
as previously announced, the Dramat
ic Club will give The Gentleman 
Next Door, from Dickens Nicholas 
Nickleby, in connection with the 
Swiss Times. This change is due 
to difficulty in securing the book, but 
the substitution is a good one, and 
will entirely equal the first selection 
if, indeed, it does not excell it. Try
outs for the parts will take place 
Monday and hard work will imme
diately begin for the girls chosen, so 
that a successful evening may be as
sured. It behooves all the girls, but 
those belonging to the Dramatic Club 
most of all, to do everything in their 
power to help. It is a big undertak
ing and so far, the work has been done 
by a few, while various comments as 
to how, when, and where, have been 
heard. Instead of criticizing, girls, 
make a suggestion which will improve 
the special point you are worrying 
about, and alsobesides suggesting, 
put your shoulder to the wheel and 
pushbut do it in harmony with the 
other girls, for only by joint effort 
will anything worth while be accom
plished.
PLEBE OFFICERS ELECTED.
At the Plebe Class Meeting held on 
Thursday the following class officers 
were elected: President, Helen Senn; 
Vice President, Janet Mandell; Secre
tary, Helen Bosworth; Treasurer, El

Rachel Pollack. This seems to be a 
very capable array, and shows wise 
judgment on the part of the Plebes.

Owing to several minor reasons and 
one reason in particular, the Guild 
Dance, which was to have been last 
Friday night, was indefinitely post
poned. The one particular and allimportant reason was the lack of sup
port of the girls. Now, when the 
only charitable organization in the 
school goes to the trouble of planning 
such an event with the proceeds for 
carrying on its work, it seems that 
the least the girls can do, is to help in 
every possible way to make it a suc
cess. If a dull and tiresome lecture 
or other boresome evening had been 
planned, the attitude of the girls could 
be understood, but when the enter
tainment offered was a real, live and 
interesting dance, one fails entirely 
in comprehending the reason.
After Christmas, the Guild is plan
ning another social event based on 
entirely different tactics which prom
ises to be original and right up-to-theminute. So the girls are all emphat
ically urged to use just a little of that 
wonderful and elusive thing called 
school spirit and make the affair a 
most brilliant success, in order to 
cover up the failure of the first at
tempt.
The Margaret Morrison School 
team will receive Varsity sweaters 
this year for the first time. Conse
quently the kind of letters or emblem 
to be used is a question for considera
tion. This is of interest not only to 
the basketball teams, but to those who 
expect to play in the Spring Tennis 
Tournament for the same kind of 
sweaters will be awarded to the ten
nis champion as will be given to the 
girls on the Varsity team.
The Athletic Association is anxious 
to have the opinions of the students 
upon the matter, and it is hoped that 
every girl will give this her consider
ation, and will help the Association to 
decide the question.
We want a letter or an emblem 
which will meet the approval of the 
students because we expect and hope 
that it will remain the same for the 
teams of the coming years. There
fore, we do not want to inflict on them 
any kind of an emblem, but rather, 
something which will look good for 
all times, and something representa
tive of our college. The Athletic As
sociation will present the subject at 
a Students Assembly in the near fu
ture, and it is hoped that some good 
ideas will be suggested.

MUSICAL CLUBS FIRST 
CONCERT.
The musical clubs gave their first 
concert of the season on Saturday 
night, December 5th, at Marshalsea, 
Pa. Both clubs made a good showing, 
and with the wealth of material at 
hand, there is no reason why this 
should not be one of the most success
ful seasons in the history of the or
ganization.
A special private car was provided 
for the musicians both to and from 
Pittsburgh. Upon reaching Marshal
sea the men were served with a sump
tuous supper. The clubs returned to 
Pittsburgh about eleven oclock that 
night. On Tuesday of this week they 
appeared in McDonald.
BOOST.
The Boosters Committee, which, 
during the past year, rendered such 
valuable service to Carnegie Tech, is 
again in operation.
The object of this committee, as 
was the case in the past, is to encour
age every student to get some high 
school seniors interested in Carnegie 
Tech, as the institution for their fu
ture education. Circulars and cards, 
which set forth the advantages of this 
Institution will be distributed during 
the general lectures of the various 
schools, and if each student, during 
the coming Christmas vacation, will 
hand these to the seniors of the high 
school of home town, we will not only 
spread the name of our Alma Mater 
far and wide, but next year we will 
have the largest Plebe class in his
tory.
Any information or help of any kind 
will be given gladly by the committee 
representatives of the various schools.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
The discussion concerning the es
tablishment of a Carnegie Union in 
the upper floor of the Central Build
ing brought forth a number of wor
thy suggestions at the meeting of the 
Student Assembly last Wednesday as 
to how this new club room should be 
furnished. Upon vote, the majority 
of the students are inclined to object 
to having the room entirely given over 
to club space but are of the opinion 
that provision should be made for 
holding dances similar to those which 
have lately brought this spacious hall 
into local prominence. Those who 
believe the room should be given over 
wholly to club room equipment are in 
the great minority and represent the 
non-dancing student body.
We are heartily in favor of any ar
rangement which would permit the 
continuation of recent school func
tions, and, at the same time, give 
ample space for the establishment of 
such a Union as exists at Michigan, 
Harvard, Trinity and other colleges.
An Industries Plebe was the unfor
tunate victim of Sophomore hazing 
last week when, after repeated warn
ings, he arrived at school minus the 
regulation cap. The forge shop tank 
proved very effective and since the 
occurrence of this act the bell hat is 
very much in evidence. The neglect 
in carrying out school customs ap
pears to be, in the minds of some of 
the Plebes, an act of bravery but ex
amples made of these offenders should 
be of sufficient interest to their class
mates to warrant closer attention to 
Senior regulations.
Another matter concerning which 
Plebes of all schools should give at
tention is in the form of a warning 
that the tables reserved in the Com
mons are for Seniors only. A number 
of freshmen have made these tables 
their own and are requested to use 
any in the Commons other than these.
W. W. Mitchell, Plebe president 
and Varsity end, has left for his home 
in Illinois to recuperate from recent 
illness at the West Penn. A number 
of his classmates saw him off at the 
station wishing him an early return.
Adamson and Bushong, Industries 
Thistle representatives, are actively 
engaged in getting work through for 
the next issue of the Tech year book. 
Any assistance students can give them 
will be appreciated by these men.
The new clubroom is soon to be 
fitted up with additional chairs, and 
other equipment. Another request 
goes out for more pennants. As a 
suggestion to the various classes, it 
might be befitting for them to club 
together and have a large banner made 
representing the year these classes 
graduate.

only take a cure for the annexing

I remember, I remember thee, O fair

Thou stayest far across the sea, O

I have seen thee in autumn dawn,
I have seen thee in moon-lit eve;
I have visioned thee in my heart, O 
maiden from afar,
I have listened to thy songs that 
melted in that yon blue sky;
I have consecrated my soul to thee, 
O maiden from afar;
I have wandered from land to land, 
Till at last I am come to thee as thy 
guest unawares.
In The Electrical World was re
cently printed an article on electric 
supply stations in great cities, from 
which it appears that New York now 
has the greatest connected load, 
while Chicago has the lowest aver
age price and the greatest average 
per capita consumption. The small
est per capita consumption is credited 
to Paris. The striking feature in re
cent electrical progress is the great 
observable trend toward the consoli
dation of stations and the installation 
of large units. Some of the more in
teresting facts in the article have been 
summarized in The Wall Street 
Journal as follows:
London, where a movement has 
been started for centralization of power-supply, leads all other cities in the 
number of stations, being served by 
no fewer than 70 stations, with an av
erage capacity of but 5,400 kilowatts 
each. London, with a population of 
7,250,000, has an area of 693 square 
miles, and its annual consumption per 
capita is 130 kilowatt-hours and the 
average price for current for all pur
poses is 4:5 cents. The connected load 
of all London is 523,865 kilowatts.
New York, which twenty years ago 
had twenty systems, now has but four, 
serving an area of 131 square miles 
and a population of 4,754,000. The 
connected load of all New York sta
tions is 782,682 kilowatts, the greatest 
of any city in the world and the aver
age capacity of the main stations is
94,000 kilowatts, with an estimated 
average annual consumption per cap
ita of 360 kilowatt-hours at an average 
price of 5.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for 
the New York Edison.
Chicago, which has one of the 
greatest electrical outputs of any city, 
has an average station capacity of 90,- 
000 kilowatts with a connected load 
of 545,235 kilowatts, and the largest 
annual per capita consumption of any 
city in the world, with 425 kilowatthours. The average price in Chicago 
also is the lowest in the worlds great 
cities, being about 2.18 cents a kilo
watt-hour. Chicago has 191 square

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
T. A. C. PLANS MANY FEATURES
At a meeting of Tech Architectural 
Club in Design School last Wednes
day evening many interesting topics 
were discussed. Among the most im
portant is a banquet to be held in 
Hotel Schenley on Tuesday, Decem
ber 15. It is to be held after initiation 
ceremonies. The charges will be borne 
by the club.
A competition was suggested and it 
was decided to hold one in the very 
near future. The subject will no doubt 
be some small architectural feature 
embodying monuments, rest houses 
and the like. A first and second prize 
will be awarded.
It was decided at the same meeting 
to hold a dance after the Christmas 
vacation. The T. A. C. has made great 
progress so far this year and intends 
to do better. There is an interest 
taken which has never been expressed 
before.
JUNIOR SMOKER POSTPONED.
The Annual Junior Smoker, held by 
Design Juniors has been postponed 
on account of Class A charette and 
other definite reasons. Watch for the 
date and support it. The committee 
promises a bigger and better smoker 
than ever before. Big surprises are 
being worked out.
NEW FUND STARTED.
The new Design School Activities 
Fund has begun its operation. The 
fund was fully explained in the issue 
of The Tartan November 25. If the 
students will render their support the 
organization will be a success and in 
the future will do away with untimely 
assessments. A student in each de
partment is a representative. Dont 
fail to see him and talk business.

The Symphony Orchestra of the 
Department of Music, School of Ap
plied Design, made its initial bow be
fore a discriminating, as well as an in
dulgent audience, in the Theatre on 
the evening of Carnegie Day, Novem
ber 25th, under the baton of the Di
rector, Mr. Vick OBrien, who is to 
be congratulated upon the results 
achieved in the short period he has 
had this student organization in hand 
to say nothing of the handicaps un
der which this department has had to 
labor.
That this body of students was able 
to present so varied a programme, em
bracing a Haydn Symphonytwo 
Movements from Massenets Thais, 
two Grieg numbers and the always 
welcome Blue Danube Waltzes, in the 
finished manner and with the variety 
of tone-color necessary for the con
trasting numbers, reflects much credit 
on the individual performers and more 
on the man who has succeeded in 
welding their crudities into so smooth 
a performance.
The prompt response to the baton
was particularly noticeable in the sec
ond movement of the Symphony and 
the ensemble, a most, if not the most 
important feature in orchestral, work 
was good. The Massenet numbers 
were given with much feeling and met 
a hearty response, while in Griegs 
Hall of the Mountain King was dis
played all the grotesqueness and hopgoblin effects which our imagination 
has taught us to expect in this fan
tastic number.
Not a little pleasure and interest was 
added to the programme by the ap
pearance of Miss Adele Henig, stu
dent, as soloist in two piano numbers, 
Gavotte by DAlbert and Etude by 
Liszt. She was most cordially re
ceived and acquitted herself in a man
ner which reflects credit on her train
ing and her knowledge of the re
sources of her instrument. The cantabile character of the Liszt number was 
well brought out, the tone being rich 
and full.
Mr. OBrien, head of the Depart
ment of Music, may feel that he has 
achieved something worth while in 
presenting this programme to the pub
lic, who hopes to hear from him again, 
in like manner. The thing that proves 
it a success, beyond question, is the 
fact that Director Hamerschlag de
clared, publicly, that he was becoming 
optimistic in regard to this Depart
ment and when the Director becomes 
optimistic on the subject of Art, some
thing of moment has happened. We 
rejoice with him.

Sixes that is said to contain more 
hea'rty laughs to the minute than any 
other play in recent years begins a 
return engagement at the Alvin Thea

Herz and Hale Hamilton play the two 
leading comedy roles. Myrtle Tannehill is the leading woman in the farce, 
and Coddles, the slavey, who made 
New Yorkers sit up and take notice 
when the farce was first presented 
there, is still in the capable hands of 
Maude Eburne.

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
hr aran
The electrical laboratories are as
suming a very businesslike appearance 
with the introduction of the new 
switchboards. The boards are all 
black slate and are equipped with the 
regular plug type connectors. Each 
board has an ammeter and voltmeter 
attached so that readings may be tak
en whenever necessary. Power may 
also be relayed to all parts of the 
building very easily.
The work of installing the large 
100-K.W. transformer in Machinery 
Hall is being rapidly carried on. When 
the laboratory, which will be fully 
equipped, is completed, we may boast 
of one of the best high tension labs 
in the country.
ELECTRICAL STUDENTS TO 
GET RARE TREAT.
Perhaps few of the students in the 
Electrical Department realize the 
great opportunity that is presented to 
them in the proposed trip to Niagara 
Falls in February. The enormous 
station of the Niagara Power Co., 
which is one of the greatest of its 
kind in the world, shows clearly the 
rapid advancement of hydro-electric 
development.
The Seniors and Juniors of the 
Electrical Department should all avail 
themselves of this chance not only to 
take a fine trip but also to get in 
touch and learn by practical investi
gation how a large power plant is laid 
out and conducted.
JUNIOR CIVILS HOLD BIG 
LEAGUE CHARETTE.
#lPop Tliayor announced to his 
class last week that there was going 
to be a big examination held on Tues
day of this week. He also stated that 
those having their problems in to 
date would be excused from that ter
rible punishment. Well, they gathered 
in room 42 of the Science schools. 
That is, all but one of them did. They 
worked and ate by the light of candles 
till twelve oclock, when they went to 
one of the neighboring houses and 
held session there till six in the morn
ing, only stopping long enough to 
drink a cup of coffee, for every tenth 
problem. They used up 10 pounds of 
coffee, and 1,000 sheets of paper.
Besides working a lot of stress 
problems the Junior Civils feel that 
they had one of the best nights enter
tainment that they have ever wit
nessed. The spirit was great and the 
fellows became so intimately acquaint
ed that they were addressing each 
other in all kinds of endearing tones.
SCIENCE STAG IN CARNEGIE 
UNION ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
As December 12, the date for the 
first Science Stag of the year, ap
proaches, the students should look 
forward expectantly to the entertain
ment the Ways and Means Committele 
of the wives of the members of the 
faculty, will have provided for Satur
day evening. Perhaps a hasty trip to 
Jerusalem has been planned or 
some faculty member will give an ex
hibition of the modern dances? Who 
knows? We do, but we refuse to tell. 
The committee and your classmates 
want you to come to enjoy with them 
the mutual benefit to be derived from 
one anothers company, and to help 
judge the winner of the inter-class 
cake walk competition.
A slight change in the method of 
defraying the students share of the 
expense has been made. Instead of 
taxing the students who attend the 
party of 15 cents, every member of the 
Science School, whether he is pres
ent or not, will be assessed the mod
erate amount of ten cents. Remember 
the date, Saturday, December 12; the 
time, 8:15 P. M.; the place, Carnegie

VOLUME II OF STRUCTURAL 
DESIGN.
Volume II of Prof. Thayers book 
on Structural Design has just been 
received. It is entitled Design of 
Simple Structures, and is devoted ex
clusively to steelwork covering I-beam 
Bridges, Plate Girders, Viaducts, Ele
vated Railroads, Riveted and Pin-con
nected Trusses, Mill and High Office 
Buildings, Miscellaneous Buildings, 
Standpipes, and Elevated Tanks. The 
general method of treatment is to 
first describe each type, then to give 
the theory on which its design is 
based; next, sample computations and 
details, and finally, the bibliography. 
A great deal of importance is attached 
to the latter means of supplementing 
the matter given in the book. For ex
ample, the engineering periodicals 
publish from time to time more or less 
complete designs for bridges of var
ious kinds. These are divided accord
ing to traffic which they carry, (single 
track railroad, double track railroad, 
highway, etc.) and then arranged in 
order of span length. This makes 
current technical literature quite ac
cessible for anyone, be he student or 
engineer, who may have to design such 
a structure, let us say, a double track 
railroad bridge of two hundred feet 
span.
The author takes occasion in his 
preface to thank the Carnegie Library 
for the facilities which so many of 
us have had occasion to use. He also 
mentions among his reviewers two 
Tech alumni: Siesel, 08, now a con
tractor in Milwaukee, Wis.; and 
Latham, 09, a detailer with McClinticMarshal Construction Co., at Rankin, 
Pa.
The book has 495 ix pages, 8vo, and 
is freely illustrated with both half 
tone and line drawings. The list price 
is $4.00 and it is published by D. Van
Nostrand Co.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime

Paris has practically reduced its 
generating companies to one with an 
average station capacity of 54,000 kilo
watts, supplying an area of 31 square 
miles and a population of 2,800,000. 
The total connected load of the gener
ating stations is 226,890 kilowatts, 
which is sold at an average price of 
10.2 cents a kilowatt-hour, the highest 
in any of the worlds great cities. The 
average annual consumption of elec
tric current in Paris is but 27 kilowatthours per capita, the smallest in the 
great cities.
Berlin, with 2,200,000 population 
and an area of 24 square miles, has an 
average station capacity of 40,000 kilo
watts and a connected load of 255,721 
kilowatts. The average annual con
sumption per capita is 111 kilowatthours at an average price of 3.4 cents 
a kilowatt-hour. Hamburg, another 
German city with an area of 30 sqaure 
miles and a population of 1,000,000, is 
served by four generating stations of 
an average capacity of 11,000 kilowatts, 
and the average per capita consump
tion is but 43 kilowatt-hours a year. 
It has a connected load of 100,000 kilo
watts, and the average price for cur
rent for all purposes is 6.16 cents a 
kilowatt-hour.
It will be seen that the great cities 
of the United States compare most 
favorably with other cities in the price 
of current and far outstrip them in 
connected load and also in per capita 
consumption. In all the cities the 
tendency is toward consolidation, and 
in Paris but one company will gener
ate current and it will have but two 
stations. In Berlin and Hamburg the 
supply is in the hands of one company 
in each city.Literary Digest.

DRAMA STUDENTS WILL PRE
SENT GREEK PLAY.
The faculty and trustees of the In
stitute have been invited to be present 
at a production of Euripides tragedy, 
Iphigenia in Tauris, in the Design 
Theatre, Saturday, December 12th. 
This performance is one of the series 
to be given this winter in which the 
finest examples of dramatic art will 
be offered to the faculty and students 
of the schools.
A short musical program will be 
rendered by the symphony orchestra 
under direction of Professor OBrien.
A description of the play by Gilbert 
Murray follows:
The Iphigenia in Tauris ... is 
one of the most beautiful of the ex
tant plays of Euripides, not really a 
tragedy, in our sense, nor yet merely 
a romance. It begins in gloom and 
rises to a sense of peril, to swift and 
dangerous adventure, to joyful escape. 
So far it is like romance. But it is 
tragic in the sincerity of the charac
ter-drawing. Iphigenia, especially, 
with her mixed longings for revenge 
and for affection, her hatred of the 
Greece that wronged her and her 
love of the Greece that is her only 
home, her possibilities of stony cruel
ty and her realities of swift self-sac
rifice, is a true child of her great and 
accursed house.
The plot is as follows:Iphigenia, 
daughter of Agamemnon, who was 
supposed to have been sacrificed by 
her father at Aulis, was really saved 
by Artemis and is now priestess to 
that goddess in the land of the Taurians at the extremity of the Friendless 
Sea. The Taurians are savages who 
kill all strangers, and if ever a Greek 
shall land in the wild place it will be 
her task to prepare him for sacrifice. 
She lives with this terror hanging over 
her, and the first Greek that comes is 
her unknown brother, Orestes. Their 
recognition of one another is, per
haps, the finest recognition scene in 
all Tragedy; and with its sequels of 
stratagem and escape forms a thrill
ing play, haunted not, like a tragedy 
by the shadow of death but rather by 
the shadow of homesickness. The 
characters are Greeks in a far bar
barian land, longing for home or even 
for the Greek sea. The lyrics are 
particularly fine, and most of them full 
of sea-light and the clash of waters.

There was an old geezer, and he had 
a wooden leg.
A ride he couldnt steal, and a ride 
he wouldnt beg.
So he took two spools and an old 
tin can,
And he made a little Ford, and, by 
gum, it ran!
