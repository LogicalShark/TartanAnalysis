Campus reacts to 
failed tax increase
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan News Editor
Many campus community members 
couldnt have been more relieved when 
voters in eleven counties rejected the 
Regional Renaissance Initiative (RRI)
last Tuesday. Others, like Mark ______
Kamlet, dean of the Heinz school, 
were more apprehensive.
The region has serious eco
nomic problems, and I think that 
the initiative would have been 
one step in the right direction,
Kamlet said.
The initiative called for a temporary .5 percent sales tax in
crease in Allegheny and surrounding coun
ties which would have been used to fund 
various projects to revitalize the city.
Kamlet and his colleagues conducted a 
study along with researchers from Pitt, 
Duquesne, and Price Waterhouse LLP 
which projected that the RRI would create 
between 22,000 and 30,000 new jobs by the 
year 2006. The study also projected an
increase of between 21,000 and 29,000 new 
tsresidents and $1.1-1.5 billion in personal 
income.
But not everyone bought into what the 
study implied  that the tax could have 
meant a time of economic prosperity of Pitts
burgh. A common criticism was that the
I think people felt that they 
were being hoodwinked.

majority of funds would have been used to 
build new stadiums for the Steelers and 
Pirates, which led opponents to dub the ini
tiative a stadium tax.
There was tremendous opposition, said 
Kamlet. The fact that it went down was not 
a surprise at all ... I think people felt that 
they were being hoodwinked.

Group begins plans for 
Morewood basement
By MICHELLE HAN
Tartan Staffwriter
A plan is currently underway 
to renovate the recently vacated 
Morewood Basement into a stu
dent hangout which will resemble 
the original Scotland Yard, once 
a popular gathering place for re
laxation, friends and food.
Most people just want a stu
dent space, said Mike Szudarek, 
member of the Morewood Base
ment Committee and a senior so
cial and decision sciences major. 
You might say Kirr Commons is 
a hangout but its basically a 
bunch of chairs in the middle of a 
building. Were thinking about 
different things that you dont 
find on campus.
Besides being a regular stu
dent hangout with late hours for 
relaxation or study, visions for 
the space include a place for stu
dent organizations to hold par
ties or other social events, perfor
mances by local bands, poetry 
readings, and other gatherings 
needing an on-campus space. The 
space will also include a desig
nated smoking area.
Realistically, without any
major unforeseen barriers, the 
place could be opened by next 
fall, said John Paul, a senior in 
mechanical engineering and 
leader of the Morewood base
ment committee.
The committee, consisting of 
student senators and members 
of the Student Dormitory Coun
cil (SDC) and working in con
junction with Hospitality Ser
vices and University Housing, is 
in the process of drafting a vi
sion statement which will out
line plans for the Morewood 
space. The next step in the pro
cess will be to obtain the funds 
needed for Facilities Manage
ment Services (FMS) to perform 
a feasibility study of the space, 
to see what renovations need to 
be made  to the bathrooms, for 
instance  to bring the building 
up to code.
The committee hopes to enlist 
the help of Student Senate, 
alumni relations, and possibly 
SDC or other contributors for fi
nancial resources for the study.
' Once we get that money, it will 
get the ball rolling, said Paul.
While obtaining funding for the 
FMS study  which will cost an
estimated $2000  will not be 
a . problem, according to 
Szudarek, funding issues could 
cause delays down the road.
I am concerned because we 
dont know where to go [for 
funding], said Szudarek. In 
the long run, we dont know 
where the moneys going to 
come from.
Funding is a huge issue, said 
Michael Murphy, dean of stu
dent affairs. Clearly, there will 
need to be some up-front capital 
support, but it will [also] need to 
have a viable business plan.
Provided the initial funds are 
obtained, the committee will 
have more time to work out 
further details of what the space 
will look like during the FMS 
study, which will take a few 
months, said Paul.
We really want to see stu
dent involvement in the ac
tual design and look of the 
room, said Szudarek. We 
have a lot of talented students 
here. Designing it ourselves 
will give the place meaning 
and spirit... and will give the 
students a reason to go there.

and Bayard Avenues.
The gunmen demanded their
According to the police file the 
students reported that the gun
man ordered them give him their 
money and then asked if they 
had any other valuables in their 
possession at the time. He then 
took both of their watches and 
left the scene.
I walk [along that route] quite 
often, actually, said Phua. I 
never felt like that would hapwallets and watches, both of pen  I always felt safe around 
which the students surrendered, that area.
Students David 
Newell, a junior Art ma
jor, and Hee Phua, a se
nior biology major were 
walking to campus after 
a midweek service at St. 
Andrews Church be
tween 9:30 and 10 pm.
They were stopped by 
a man wearing a camou
flage jacket and dark _____
pants with a dark gray mt^m 
mask over his nose, according to 
Phua. The man was in his mid
twenties, 62, 190 pounds with 
an athletic build, he said.
David saw someone from 
across the street, said Phua. 
[When he reached three yards 
within our vicinity] I could tell 
this was going to be trouble, 
said Phua. He saw the man had 
a gun, similar to a nine millime
ter, in his right hand.
Newell and Phua walked back

happen  I always felt

to their dorms located in Amberson 
Apartments where they first 
checked email, then canceled their 
credit and MAC cards.
After approximately thirty 
minutes, they called campus po
lice. When security arrived at 
the apartment complex, they ad
vised the students to call Pitts
burgh Police. The officer an
swered their call five minutes 
after it was made.
I still feel a little less safe, 
said Phua. Now Im checking 
every few minutes or so around 
my shoulder.... Im going to take 
that walk anyway.
Im not really all that different 
about [taking that route] because 
its a very safe neighborhood, 
said Newell.
Campus police put up crime 
alert flyers around campus, 
mainly in dorm rooms to in
form students of the dangers 
of theft in the area. We en
courage people to use 
the Escort system be
cause it keeps you off 
the street, said Ser
geant William 
Kozikowski of Cam
pus Police.
Escort wasnt 
meant as a conve
nience, he said. Its 
I a necessity.
Newell has some advice for 
students in a similar situation.
Students need to know 
what their immediate reac
tions should be-...just hand it 
over. Everything in your wal
let, everything you wear on 
your wrist is still replace
able, said Newell.
Dont walk alone, said 
Kozikowski. Use well-lighted 
areas and use Escort service.

Department head receives award
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
The Paul Pimsleur award, 
recognizing exceptional pub
lished foreign language re
search work, was given to G. 
Richard Tucker, head of CMUs 
Department of Modern Lan
guages. His award winning 
paper, Monitoring and Assess
ing Japanese Foreign Lan
guages in the Elementary 
Schools Program: Ambiance 
and Achievement, was a re
sult of his extensive research 
on teaching Japanese to el
ementary school students.
Rick Donato, from the De
partment of instruction and 
Learning at the University of 
Pittsburgh and Janis Antonek 
from the Department of Cur
riculum and Instruction at the 
University of North Carolina 
worked with Tucker on his lan
guage learning research. The 
team received a $180,000 grant 
from the U.S. Department of Edu
cation to aid with the develop
ment of second language profi
ciency for American students.
We were both surprised [to 
win the award] because theres 
really little attention placed on 
young children, said Tucker. 
According to Tucker, most re
search ventures regarding lan
guage acquisition involve stu
dents in middle school or higher 
levels. Tuckers project aims to 
give young students a competi
tive edge, by preparing them to 
succeed in the global economy of 
the 21st century.
Tuckers paper, published in
Language Learning in Septem
ber 1996, outlines the three pri
mary results of the study. The 
study, conducted on students 
at the Falk school in Pittsburgh, 
determined that young children 
are positively motivated to 
study Japanese. The children 
began developing the building 
blocks of language acquisition 
and formed the ability to ex
press themselves. Additionally, 
the children expressed a desire 
to continue their study of Japa
nese. We think there are ben
efits to an early study. 
Childrens 1 ack of self conscious
ness allows them to plow right 
in, said Tucker.

researcher, Tucker has pub

UNITED NATIONS (AP)  Iraq 
said it moved sensitive equipment to 
protect it from American air strikes 
and blamed the United Nations for the 
suspension of weapons inspections in 
the country. The chief U.N. weapons 
inspector, Richard Butler, had hoped 
to get his experts in this week to verify 
whether Iraq had been tampering with 
surveillance cameras at the sites and 
removing sensitive equipment.
But the inspections were scrubbed 
after Iraqis  for a fourth straight day
 refused to admit
American mem
bers of the team. It 
looks a little bit like, 
the cats away, the 
mice will play, 
Butler said. He also 
said U-2 surveil
lance flights, which 
were suspended 
this week, would 
resume Monday.
In a letter to the 
Security Council, 
Iraqi Foreign Min
ister Mohammed 
Saeed al-Sahhaf 
acknowledged 
moving some 
equipment, but

Mike McCurry said Iraqs action 
proves our concern about (Iraqi Presi
dent) Saddam Husseins unwillingness 
to comply with relevant Security Coun
cil resolutions is well-placed.
Vice President A1 Gore said the loca
tion of the cameras and the timing of 
the inspections are worked out labori
ously by the U.N. inspectors. Saddam 
must know that he has to comply with 
the will of the international commu
nity as expressed in the resolutions 
and as enforced by those  including

undertaking to 
make sure that 
he complies, 
Gore said.
Iraq did not 
prevent the 
monitoring 
groups from con
ducting their in
spection visits. 
Rather, it re
quested the 
Americans not 
enter, alSahhaf said. He 
said Butler 
bears full re
sponsibility for 
...preventing the 
inspection teams 
from conducting 
their functions.
U.S. air strike was imminent. He 
said the equipment would be re
turned to the original location and 
the United Nations would be allowed 
to inspect it once any threat of an air 
strike ends.
Theyve turned the|ightsoff,,and 
its pretty hard to take pictures when 
youve got no lights, Butler told CNN. 
In other places, theyve simply ob
structed the cameras, put bags over 
the lenses. Butler had informed the 
Security Council on Wednesday that 
it would take only a few hours to adapt 
some of the equipment involved to 
produce seed stocks of biological war
fare agent. White House spokesman
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz also lashed out at Butler, accus
ing him of trying to mislead the Se
curity Council and to escalate the 
situation with the aim of misleading 
international public opinion.
Each time the U.N. teams tried to 
resume inspections since Monday, they 
were turned back because they in
cluded Americans. The inspections are 
meant to check whether Iraq has de
stroyed all long-range missiles and 
weapons of mass destruction, includ
ing poison gas and lethal biological 
toxins. That is the key requirement for 
lifting strict U.N. sanctions imposed 
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Federal antitrust 
review delays deal
ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP)  The 
merging of Power Computing Corp. and 
Apple Computer Inc. has been delayed 
by a federal antitrust review, a Power 
Computing Corp. official said. U.S. at
torneys may be using the review to look 
for evidence in the U.S. Justice 
Departments case against Microsoft 
Corp., John Teets, Power Computings 
corporate counsel, said Wednesday.
Teets says the attorneys in San Fran
cisco have asked for thousands of items 
including some that have little to do 
with Apples acquisition of Power 
Computings key assets.
It appears that theyre fishingfor some
thing more than our transaction with 
Apple, Teets said. Tt appears to pertain 
to their ongoinginvestigation ofMicrosoft.
A provision of federal law known as the 
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improve
ments Act requires review by either the 
Justice Department or the Federal Trade 
Commission of corporate mergers or acqui
sitions valued at more than $15 million.
Justice Department spokeswoman Gina 
Talamona would confirm only that the 
U.S. government is reviewing the deal 
between Apple and Power Computing.
The agreement calls for Apple to pay 
$100 million in common stock for Power 
Computings database of customers, in
tellectual property, and other major as
sets. Power Computing, once a Mac-clone 
maker, is winding down its Macintosh 
business by the end of the year. The delay 
in executing the agreement is slowing 
Power Computings move into the IBMcompatible laptop business.
Officials from both Apple, which is 
based in Cupertino, California, and 
Power Computing expected at least a 
cursory review of the agreement that 
was announced September 2.
Bird brain might 
be complimentary
CHICAGO (AP)  Polly want an edu
cation?
Maybe Polly doesnt need one. New re
search seems to indicate that parrots, like 
chimps and dolphins, are capable of mas
tering complex intellectual concepts that
children cannot handle until the age of 5. 
Pet experts gathering in Chicago today for 
the American Veterinary Associations 
annual animal welfare forum believe the 
parrots intelligence is why the popularity 
of the bird has grown faster than any other 
pet over the past decade.
Irene Pepperberg is an ecologist and 
evolutionary biologist who studies the 
intelligence of parrots. Pepperberg, of 
the University of Arizona in Tucson, has 
focused her studies on a parrot she 
bought at a Chicago pet store in 1977.
That bird, Alex, can name 50 objects 
when shown them, knows colors, knows 
numbers up to eight and even under
stands the concepts of same and different.
All of the tests weve done with dol
phins and great apes to investigate their 
intelligence, weve done with Alex, 
Pepperberg said. He scored as well as 
they did in many of them, better in some.
Bird brains are different from those of 
advanced mammals, catching the interest 
of neurologists, psychologists, and others. 
I compare parrot brains with chimp brains 
like people compared the old Macintosh 
computers with IBM computers. They are 
wired in different ways and they use dif
ferent software to do the same things, but 
when the same data goes in, the same 
answers come out of both systems.
Intelligence doesnt always equal a 
good pet, however. Experts say the bird 
is domineering and sometimes difficult 
to understand, and although they can 
live up to 80 years, many people give up 
these pets after the first five years.
Barney files suit 
against chicken
SAN DIEGO (AP)  Barney may love 
you and he may love me, but he doesnt 
love The Famous San Diego Chicken.
The purple dinosaurs owners have 
filed a copyright and trademark in
fringement lawsuit against The Chicken 
for ridiculing and assaulting a Barney
like character during performances.
Texas-based Lyons Partnership said 
the red and yellow chicken mascot, Ted 
Giannoulas, was first notified in 1994 
that using the Barneylike costume in 
his act constituted infringement of Lyons 
trademarks and copyrights and violated 
state and federal laws.
Specifically, Giannoulas would punch, 
flip, stand on and otherwise assault the
putative Barney,  the lawsuit alleges.
The company wants a permanent in
junction against use of the dinosaur cos
tume and a minimum $100,000 for each 
time Giannoulas has performed a skit 
with the dinosaur in it.
The complaint said that, because 
Barney consumers are young children, 
they arent likely to know the difference 
between the real Barney and the one 
getting knocked around by San Diegos 
infamous fowl.
Kenneth Fitzgerald, an attorney for 
The Chicken, said the act is a parody 
protected under the Copyright Act, trade
mark laws and the First Amendment.
By engagingin slapstick physical com
edy with a break-dancing Barney, The 
Famous San Diego Chicken.humorously 
portrays the real Barney as naive, gull
ible, clumsy and just plain goofy, 
Fitzgerald said in a statement.
Congress passes 
FDA legislation
WASHINGTON (AP)  Culminating 
years of work, Congress on Sunday ap
proved legislation that will bring basic 
changes to the Food and Drug Adminis
tration and accelerate the approval of 
lifesaving drugs.
The bill gives Congress one major 
achievement as it brings a quarrelsome 
and highly partisan session to a close.
The bill expands patient access to new 
drugs, provides for accelerated approval of 
some drugs and medical devices and allows 
the Health and Human Services secretary 
to accredit independent third-party groups 
to speed up reviews of low-risk devices.
It also reauthorizes a five-year pro
gram under which fees paid by drug 
companies have gone to hire 600 new 
reviewers who have helped cut the back
log in new medicine approvals.
The process of moving this bill to 
enactment over the past four years has 
been long, difficult and contentious, said 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who 
held up the legislation for weeks this fall 
as he fought for changes in provisions he 
thought were detrimental to consumers.
The industry was generally pleased. 
Congress has written a prescription that 
will bring safe and effective drugs to 
patients sooner, said Alan F. Holmer, 
president of the Pharmaceutical Re
search and Manufacturers of America.Maueioubcew tDo mbo bunw hmcvua sta tGubibh ts cvu Srev DiFamay
COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
(AP)  They came by the thou
sands to honor George Bush. 
Three past presidents. Notable 
U.S. leaders. Former prime min
isters and diplomats. Sixty-plus 
members of his own family. And 
the most memorable story came 
from an uncle who recalled their 
baseball days at Yale Univer
sity, particularly a game about 
50 years ago.
It was a match-up between the 
team that Bush led as captain 
and an alumni team, with Uncle 
Lou Walker pitching smoking 
curveballs. Until George stepped 
up to the plate. In the sixth in
ning, were leading them 4-1, and 
one of my curves didnt break and
he hit it, Walker said, laughing. 
Its still going.
With the George Bush Presi
dential Library and Museum offi
cially opened Thursday, the former 
presidents glory days from Yale 
baseball to the White House were 
captured for the nation to see.
America has had a good man 
whose decency and emotions served 
our country well, and that is the 
story this library will tell for gen
erations to come, said President 
Clinton, the man who forced Bush 
into retirement five years ago.
An estimated 20,000 people, 
including former Presidents 
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, 
gathered for the dedication of the 
library at Texas A&M Univer
sity. The schools band played, its 
cadets sang, and a team of para
chutists bailed out overhead, 
trailing colorful smoke.
The $80 million complex, built on 
what once was a Texas A&M hog 
farm, includes displays that trace 
Bushs life, from young World War
II bomber pilot to Yale baseball star 
to oilman who drove his wife, Bar
bara, and growing family to West 
Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
Other exhibits address his ten
ure as CIA director, U.N. ambas
sador, liaison to China, vice presi
dent under Reagan, and then 
president. He lost his re-election 
bid to Clinton in 1992. Nancy 
Reagan, representing her ailing 
husband, said former President
Ronald Reagan treasured his 
weekly lunches with Bush in the 
White House.
He enjoyed your counsel so 
much, Mrs. Reagan said. I wish 
Ronnie could be here today and tell 
you in person what I know he would 
say thank you for  your service 
and your steadfastness, but most 
of all for being his good friend.
Bush declared himself the 
luckiest man in the world. There 
is one thing left for me to do  
apologize to my mother, Bush 
told the crowd. Im afraid some of 
these exhibits today might violate 
her no bragging5 rule. I just hope 
weve in some way given proper 
credit to all with whom I worked 
during every chapter of my life.

50 YEARS AGO, December 16, 
1947All students received their 
Christmas present from the ad
ministration a little early. They 
got their gifts in the form of the 
suspension of classes on the previ
ous Friday afternoon and Satur
day morning. The heat was shut 
off temporarily, due to a break
down of electrical equipment in 
the heating system. The heating 
was not restored until the next 
afternoon. The breakdown, beside 
freeing thousands of students for 
a long weekend, caused a post
ponement of the performance of 
Wingless Victory, which had to 
be rescheduled.
25 YEARS AGO, November 
14, 1972  While today CMU is 
preparing online registration for 
its debut, 25 years ago, CMU was 
just starting to give priority to 
from National Weather Service bulletins and other sources majors by pre-registering. It was
Carnegie Almanac
decided that the individual de
partments would handle the pre
registration. There were differ
ences between the way pre-regis
tration was handled. Students 
who pre-registered were given 
preference over all students who 
did not pre-register, regardless 
of their major or year.
10 YEARS AGO,November 10, 
1987At about 8 am, November 
8, a jogger found the body of Car
negie Mellon student Thomas 
Godfrey under Schenley Park 
Bridge. Godfrey, who was a jun
ior statistics major, apparently 
jumped from the bridge around 3 
am. There was no evidence of foul 
play nor any indication of alcohol 
or narcotics use. According to 
some friends, Godfrey entered 
CMU in 1984 as a Civil Engineer
ing major. He returned to his 
home in Illinois where he enrolled
in mathematics and arts courses 
at University of Illinois in Chi
cago. He then came back to CMU 
for the fall 1987 semester. Dean 
of Student Affairs Brad Walter 
explained that [Im not trying 
to] protect the student body from 
this thing, but on the other hand, 
I dont want it to be romanticized. 
It was a tragic death to a young 
man... clearly an awful tragedy.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Novem
ber 9, 1992  A CMU professor, 
J.S.G. Boggs, was given the label 
of counterfeiter by the United 
States Secret Service. Boggs would 
make his money by drawing or 
painting it with acrylics and/or 
ink, and then printed it with a 
laser copier. But the reproduc
tions were intentionally not iden
tical. He would reverse the plates 
on the back, replace the signature 
of the Secretary of the Treasury
withhisown, orwould even change 
the inscription This Note Is Le
gal Tender for All Debts, Public 
and Private with his own inscrip
tion, The Note is Legal Art for All 
Those Who Agree, See? Boggs 
did use his money in exchange 
for goods and services, but he 
would make it clear to the pur
chasers that they were getting a 
work of art, not hard cash.
ONE YEAR AGO, November 
11,1996  On November 2, Cam
pus Police was alerted that a new 
computer was stolen from a Mate
rials Science Engineering Depart
ment office. Sergeant Sima said 
that to remove a computer like 
that, the room had to have been 
left unsecure or the thief had to 
have had access to the room.

Students react to 
renaissance taxes
TAX, from page 1
Among the initiatives harshest crit
ics at CMU was Herbert Simon, win
ner of the Nobel Prize for Economics 
in 1978 and University professor of 
psychology. Simon called the initia
tive a lot of hogwash.
I was extremely skeptical at the claims 
that we were going to produce ... a sig
nificant amount of jobs by spending that 
money on stadii, said Simon. I really 
did not see the justification for spending 
tax money to support a private enter
prise.... The largest part of it went to 
stadiums, lets face it.
Even our projections never showed 
that stadiums by themselves are big 
engines of economic growth, said 
Kamlet. Sports teams dont do that. 
Kamlet said there were more impor
tant development projects proposed in 
the initiative, such as the expansion of 
the convention center, the plans for a 
cultural district and for park space along 
the Allegheny river, and development at 
the Brownfield site.
Simon said he had not looked at Kamlets 
study in detail, but noted, That kind of 
crystal-ball gazing doesnt come easy. 
Simon said that certain assump
tions have to be made in any eco
nomic study, to which Kamlet agreed. 
There were a lot of assumptions, 
great and small, he said.
For example, the study group counted 
on the eventual augmentation of state 
funds to local and private monies to 
assist with development projects. The 
study also assumed a significant amount 
of private investment.
Another concern Simon raised was 
that there are two different kind of jobs: 
those in what Simon called export in
dustries, which bring money into the 
community from outside, and those that 
merely reshuffle the way we spend 
money with each other.
And the winner is...
The latter, which Simon likened to 
taking in each others laundry, brings 
no new money to the community.
I dont have any objection in principle 
[with tax initiatives], said Simon. I 
think that municipalities can have good 
reasons for putting money into the in
frastructure ... [that] are perfectly le
gitimate if you can justify [them].
Of course things need to be done for 
the economy of the city of Pittsburgh, 
and I wish people would think of the 
right things so I could vote for them. 
We tried very carefully to make 
sure that we didnt count the re
shuffled jobs as new jobs, said 
Kamlet. If we had done that that 
would have been a mistake.
Simon, who has lived in Pittsburgh for 
47 years, arrived in the city during the 
first renaissance. He said the economy 
has since taken heavy hits as the na
tional economy has changed, but adds, 
Wishes cant always be the fathers of 
good thought.
On the way to the polls, I thought, I 
like the Pirates and the Steelers, and its 
only going to cost me pennys a day, so 
why not? said David Klahr, professor of 
psychology. Then ... I realized that I 
had the same feeling about this proposal 
as I get when I read a pretty good first 
draft of a paper from a student: some 
good ideas, some not so good, and a lot of 
room for improvement.... I voted no.
I guess I have mixed feelings [about 
the defeat], said Kamlet, who has lived 
in Pittsburgh 20 years. I am disap
pointed that the initiative didnt pass. I 
worry that the region will adopt a sort 
of defeatist approach towards its fu
ture, but I do think that the debate that 
took place did highlight a number of 
problems that the region has to ad
dress.... And Im glad the debate got 
started. This is just the beginning of 
that debate.
Group plans to fill vacant space
AWARD, from page 1
It [will be] their space and theyll 
have pride in it.
The decision to create a student 
hangout came from a variety of input, 
including studies by the departments
of Statistics and Indus_________
trial Management sur
veying how students 
wanted to see the space 
put to use.
Dean Murphy said the 
space has been allocated 
to student affairs and 
that he supports the stu
dents in their decision on 
how to use it. I think it is Call 
great that students are 
taking the initiative [that] they are, 
and we have to be helpful in making 
their vision come to reality.
The committees decision to have 
designated smoking space was nearly
unanimous, said Szudarek. Smoking 
students pay just as much Activities Fee 
as non-smoking students [do], and theres 
no place on campus to smoke except 
Highlander. And you have to pay to get 
in there, said Szudarek.
Realistically; without any major 
unforeseen barriers, the place 
could be opened by next fall.
 John Paul 
Morewood basement committee
While plans to begin work are under
way, Paul said that a project of this kind 
requires time and support.
Right now [the basement] looks like 
a construction site, said Szudarek. Its
in shambles. Its going to be a major 
job to fix it up.
We have to go through all the proper 
channels to make sure things are up to 
code, said Paul. Unfortunately, this 
means bureaucracy and time delays
_______ that come with any major
renovation project.
Paul said issues such as 
food regulations, handi
capped accessibility, and 
smoking codes will have to 
be addressed as well.
There are a lot of people 
really working on this com
mittee, said Paul. Theyre 
5 all students and [are] putting 
in a lot of time on this thing.... 
We really need a lot of student support. 
Students who wish to express inter
est or additional ideas for the space 
should send email to John Paul at 
jp5y@andrew.cmu.edu.

cmuOut sponsors 
Gay Jeans Day
cmuOUT, Carnegie Mellons student 
organization for gay, lesbian and bi
sexual concerns, is sponsoring a 
celbration of Gay Jeans Day, Wednes
day, November 12. cmuOUT invites 
everyone in the campus community to 
wear jeans to show support for gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual students, faculty, 
and staff. Colleges across the country 
have held Gay Jeans Days since the 
early seventies.
For those who wish to express their 
support but cannot wear jeans on No
vember 12 for whateverreason, cmuOUT 
will provide denim ribbons to pin on 
clothes or backpacks.
Members of the campus community 
can join the discussion by posting to 
cmu.student.out.opinion, or can mail 
cmuOUT confidentially at out@andrew.
CMU switches to 
online registration
Thanks to the ongoing Enrollment 
Process Reengineering initiative, stu
dents will use Carnegie Mellons OnLine Registration (OLR) to register for 
their Spring 1998 classes. Seniors and 
graduate students will be the first to 
use the system starting 6 am, Monday, 
November 17.
OLR was tested by computer science 
and electrical and computer engineer
ing students in a pilot program last 
spring. Students will log into OLR 
through the HUBs Web site, enter their 
Andrew user ID and password, and follow the instructions to enter their de
sired courses and sections.
Course prerequisites are checked au
tomatically. Students attempting to en
roll in classes that are already filled 
will be given the opportunity to join the 
waiting list.
The only priority status to be given 
will be to primary majors.
Eight workshops to help students learn 
how to use the new system are sched
uled for this week. Two one hour ses
sions will be held November 10-13 in 
Doherty Hall 2210. Instructional hand
outs are also available for students 
throughout campus.
Group speaks on 
renewable power
Next week, the Western Pennsylva
nia Sustainable Energy Association 
(WPSEA) will be sponsoring a campus 
presentation to provide an overview of 
utility deregulation and to explore the 
prospect for renewable power genera
tion in the region.
Making Cents Out of Deregulation: 
Bringing Renewable Energy to Western 
Pennsylvania will be held in the Single
ton Room of Roberts Hall on Wednes
day, Nov. 12, at 7 p.m.
Given the Ridge Administrations 
desire for Pennsylvania to be a low-cost 
energy supplier on a national scale, the 
regional effects of deregulation are ex
pected to be sweeping and unprec
edented in scale, said WPSEA Presi
dent Marc Mondor.
What has particularly raised suspi
cion among environmental groups is a 
clause effectively barring the genera
tion of renewable power on the basis of
cost, as well as the laws attachment 
to an unrelated piece of legislation, 
effectively avoiding an open floor vote. 
The result has the potential not only 
to further increase reliance on fossil 
fuel burning plants, such as oil and 
coal, but to reopen nearby polluting 
plants that are currently unused due 
to their inefficiency.
Presenters will include Bill Hopwood, 
a nationally renowned renewable en
ergy expert; David Hughes of Citizen 
Power, Inc.; Jan Jarrett of the Pennsyl
vania Campaign for Clean Affordable 
Energy; and Bob Orchowsky of Duquesne 
Light, Inc. A $5 donation is requested for 
non-WPSEA members. Refreshments 
will be provided.

Crime and Incident Report
10/31 CRIMINAL MIS
CHIEF, 10:28 am  An officer 
was sent to take a report from a 
person who noticed that someone 
had painted the face of Athur 
Arton Hamerschlag green. The 
relief is featured on a bronze 
plaque in Baker Hall. The woman 
said that she doesnt usually look 
at the plaque but that she noticed 
the paint that day. The officer 
asked secretaries in the surround
ing offices if they had seen the 
painter in the area. They had not. 
The officer contacted Central 
Property Services to have the 
defaced likeness cleaned up.
10/31 TRESPASS, 10:37 am 
Aman called Campus Police to 
report that two or three individu
als were sitting outside on the 
ledge of the roof of Resnik Hall. 
Three officers reported to the roof 
where they spoke with three 
males, two being CMU students 
and the other a visitor. The offic
ers informed the two of CMUs 
policy on outside roofs and para
pets and also of the danger of 
being on the roofs in general. The 
three understood the dangers and 
were apologetic about the inci
dent, saying it would never hap
pen again. Nevertheless, they 
were issued internal citations.
11/1 UNDERAGE CONSUMPTION, 12:02 am  Two
officers patrolling the fraterni
ties observed a male stagger, 
stumble, and fell down the rear 
stairs of a fraternity house. Upon 
checking his well-being, the offic
ers noticed the odor of alcohol on 
his breath.
They asked the actor his age, 
and he said he was 19. He went 
on to say that he had not been 
drinking but that he was very 
tired because he had not slept the 
night before. The officers didnt 
buy it, and they issued him an 
internal citation. The actor was 
released into the custody of the 
fraternitys president and a highranking official in the Inter-Fraternity Council.
11/2 MEDICAL,3:49 pm  A 
security monitor informed a Cam
pus Police sergeant that three 
days ago she had jammed her left 
wrist while reaching for a stair
well door. She said that she was
in the stairwell of Wean Hall at 
the fifth floor door, and, as she 
reached for the doorknob to exit, 
an unidentified person opened the 
door from the hallway side. At 
this time the victim was struck 
with the door, pushing her left 
hand back and into the wall. Her 
hand was still hurting when she 
gave the report and she was trans
ported to Shadyside Hospital.
11/3 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 1:07 am  A security 
guard radioed Campus Police to 
report that an individual was 
throwing objects out of a McGill 
Hall and towards Hamerschlag 
House. The guard had stopped 
and identified the actor by the 
time the officers responded to 
the call.
The actor had a slingshot in his 
hand, and admitted to propelling 
projectiles at Hamerschlag. He 
was issued an internal citation
for propelling missiles from win
dows. A check of the surrounding 
area revealed objects such as fresh 
ketchup, an empty can of shaving 
cream, and a disposable lighter 
as well as small pebbles and pieces 
of pumpkin.
 Chief of Campus Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the Editor-inChief, the News Editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of complain
ants, victims, suspects, andfratemity 
names are omitted from the printed 
report. Ethnic descriptions and other 
personal details are given only in the 
context of complete descriptions.
 Not every incident that occurs 
appears in the report.

Letters to the Editor
As it stands, University policy 
does not allow for double majors 
and minors to receive any kind of 
priority during registration, but 
most departments had lessened 
this inconvenience by allowing 
these students to pre-register for 
classes at the same time as ma
jors. With the advent of on-line 
registration (OLR), this adopted 
procedure will no longer be an 
option. The only students who 
will receive registration priority 
are primary majors, but the new 
technology should allow for al
ternative systems that can still 
give double majors and minors 
priority and at the same time 
accommodate the needs of pri
mary majors.
Starting this semester, depart
ments will reserve a certain num
ber of seats in classes for primary 
majors; there is no reason why 
the same cannot be done for sec
ondary majors and minors as 
well. These students should be 
able to receive priority on the 
wait list. Right now, many stu
dents are worried about getting 
into their classes because the sys
tem is new to them, and because 
they fear students plan to log on 
to their computers at six am. If 
the University implements a 
method of giving prioritization 
for students with double majors 
and minors 9Which includes most 
students) much anxiety will be 
quelled, leading to a smoother 
registration process.
Another solution would be to 
set up a multi-tiered system in
In a little more than a week 
from now, students will be asked 
to vote on a referendum to in
crease the Student Activities Fee 
by 30 percent. They will be asked 
to pay an extra $15, increasing 
the fee from $50 to $65 a semes
ter and chances are the easiest 
choice that most students are opt 
to make is to vote down the refer
endum. But most students do not 
see where that money goes and 
how it is used. More importantly, 
they do not see that an increase 
is sorely needed because of infla
tion and a significant increase in 
the number of student organiza
tions on campus.
Since the last Activities Fee 
hike in 1991, the number of stu
dent organzations has nearly 
doubled, which means the num
ber of groups requesting Senate 
funding has significantly in
creased as well. In addition, the 
cost of running a student orga
nization has gone up in the last 
four years due to inflation. The 
discrepancy in the financial 
needs of student groups and 
Senate allocation of funds has 
lead to a strain on many organi
zations budgets. Initiators of 
the increase hope to put the 
extra monies towards these 
groups to alleviate existing bud
get crunches.
After the Graduate Student 
Assemblys (GSA) autonomy from 
Student Senate takes place, the 
amount of funding Senate will 
have available to give to student
which OLR spans over a longer 
period. With this system, primary 
majors would register the first 
week, double majors and minors 
during the second and non-majors would register in the third 
week. In this way, students who 
need certain classes as require
ments would not be competing 
with non-majors and primary 
majors would not be competing 
with double majors and minors. 
In addition to the loss of 
prioritization, students will no 
longer be able to overload classes 
during registration without ad
visors to help override the sys
tem  another method students 
must sometimes resort to in or
der to complete their secondary 
concentration on time.
Enrolling in a second discipline 
provides students with the op
portunity to broaden their edu
cation and explore areas of per
sonal interest. In fact, a number 
of departments require that their 
undergraduates declare second
ary concentrations. Yet without 
any sort of jump start during 
registration, many students shy 
away from pursuing other ma
jors out of fear of struggling to fill 
requirements. Taking on a double 
major takes planning since most 
programs of study at CMU tend 
to be structured to the point of 
rigidity. It is important that the 
University provide students with 
vehicles to make such endeavors 
easierespecially now at a time 
of transition when the possibility 
is clearly within reach.
organizations will decrease. Even 
with the help of GSA funds, Sen
ate will still need to cut budgets 
with the limited amount of re
sources that are are currently in 
circulation.
With the increase in funding 
student organizations will be able 
to expand their activities which 
will benefit the entire campus. 
During the last budgeting pro
cess, many groups offered a num
ber of projects and events that 
were forced to be cut out of bud
gets simply because Senate could 
not provide the resources for 
these organizations to carry them 
out.
Not only will individual organi
zations benefit from the hike but 
Student Government as a whole 
will have more money to initiate 
major campus-wide projects such 
as the addition of a 35 millimeter 
projector in McConomy Audito
rium. There will also be more 
opportunities for the Activities 
Board to bring big name bands 
and speakers to campusevents 
that the entire community can 
enjoy.
By taking part in the upcom
ing vote, students have the op
portunity to affect the quality of 
their campus experience. By tak
ing the time to educate them
selves about Senates referen
dum, students can adequately 
weigh both sides and make an 
informed decision  one that 
should be in support of the in
crease in the Activities Fee.
SBP comments 
on space issue
Editor:
I would like to re
spond to your Novem
ber 3 editorial on 
empty spaces on cam
pus. I agree whole
heartedly that these 
spaces need to be put to good use for 
students, and I understand that the 
purpose of an editorial is not to report 
facts. However, the explanation offered 
for why these spaces are not being uti
lized is factually incorrect. You state 
that the only thing preventing the 
[Morewood Basement] space from be
coming a campus resource is student 
initiative. I really wish that this were 
the case, because it would make my job 
a lot easier. Unfortunately, the obstacle 
to the development of the Morewood 
Basement space is not lack of initiative
 it is lack of money. Student Govern
ment simply does not have enough money 
to fund these renovations.
It has been seven years since the Ac
tivities Fee was raised, and during these 
seven years, the number of funded orga
nizations has more than doubled (from 
33 to 69). So, while inflation has sub
stantially decreased the value of the 
Activities Fee that Student Government 
allocates, the amount of money avail
able to each organization has decreased 
due to the increased competition for fund
ing. This leaves us with very little extra 
money to spend on worthwhile campus 
projects like the development of the 
Morewood Basement space or the former 
WRCT space.
We would like to be able to afford 
projects like the development of the 
Morewood Basement and the WRCT 
space. We want to give more money to 
organizations so that they could offer
more things to the campus community. 
We wish we could have a bigger Carni
val with better bands and more enter
tainment options, or have an even better 
Fiesta de Primavera (last day of classes 
party) this year. The campus would ben
efit if projects like the 35 mm projector 
for McConomy could happen every year. 
This school would be more fun if big 
bands and entertainers performed here 
more often.
The reason that all of these things 
have not happened is not a lack of stu
dent initiative. A lack of money prevents 
them from happening, but an Activities 
Fee increase would solve this problem. 
So, we have proposed a $15-per-semester increase in the Activities Fee. A ref
erendum has been scheduled for No
vember 20-21 in Kirr Commons (the 
airport lounge). Students will have the 
opportunity to vote in this referendum 
on whether or not to support Student 
Governments recommended increase.
I urge all students to vote in this 
referendum and to support this initia
tive to improve Carnegie Mellon, es
pecially those who would like to see 
these spaces utilized.

Quoted story 
violates privacy
Editor:
In response to Anne 
Rays article [Victims 
heal through relating, .
10/27], I am appalled 
by the blatant violathe Editor 
tion of trust in the decision to print a 
confidential story. Rebecca, the fresh
man in the article, is a dear friend of 
mine who would not have shared her 
story at the candlelight vigil if she were
not secure in the knowledge that the 
vigil was a safe environment. After tell
ing her story at the microphone, 
Rebecca was approached by Ms. Ray, 
who insisted on knowing Rebeccas 
name. Rebecca told Ms. Ray she pre
ferred not to have her story printed; the 
only reason she shared her story was 
because the vigil was a comfortable en
vironment for support and help.
Victims go to the microphone to share 
their experience in a safe and supportive 
environment. Many like Rebecca have 
suppressed the experience to forget the 
pain. It took a lot of strength to get up 
and relate this story of being raped 
twice at age 13 when she was drunk. To 
say that she told her story at the rally 
without flinching and with barely any 
sign of emotion is an unfair criticism, 
especially since it required so much in
ner strength to share a-painful memory 
with a group of strangers.
The microphone at the vigil gives an 
opportunity to survivors to have a voice. 
By publishing Rebeccas story after 
she clearly stated that it was deeply 
personal and should not be published for 
all to know, her voice is silenced.
She cannot write this letter for her
self since if she signs her name, every
one will know her experience. If she 
writes anonymously, her letter loses 
credibility with no one to back it up.
As Ms. Ray wrote, The goal [of Take 
Back the Night] is to create an environ
ment where women do not have to live in 
fear of violence, and where survivors of 
past violence can feel supported.
I feel Ms. Ray could best show her 
support for survivors by respecting 
the confidentiality of the Take Back 
the Night vigil. Remember, whatever 
the question is, Yes means Yes, No 
means No.

You might have to sit for 
this. Are you sitting? OK, here 
it goes. There comes a time in 
every students life when he or 
she has matured enough to 
know about some of lifes little 
secrets. If your parents havent 
told you, heres the birds and 
bees of Carnegie Mellon: work.
Regardless of which school 
we attend within the univer
sity, we have it, and more than 
our fair share. Some of us have 
to solve equations; others have 
to memorize monologues. As 
long as we attend CMU, we are 
going to be assigned enough 
work to keep us busy for, lets 
just say, a while.
Strangely enough, the 
amount of work we have fluc
tuates according to the amount 
of work we think we have. As I 
stated above, now that were 
big and what I want to do 
when I grow up starts here,
its time to realize that hard 
work will be a part of our 
life, something most of us 
will have to deal with from 
now on.If were smart, well 
deal with it effectively and 
efficiently, as if its just as 
important as doing the 
homework or studying for 
the exam.
Of course, there are many 
ways of reducing the stress 
and coping with responsi
bility, but Im not intending 
to plagiarize the freshman 
pamphlets that plagued ori
entation week. Rather, my 
suggestion is of a much 
lighter note and may very 
well rival the infamous birds 
and bees.
A wise person once said: 
When traveling down lifes 
path (or across the Cut), stop 
and smell the roses, and wise 
that person remains. In my 
slight modification ofthe same 
theory, I have one smelling all 
the flowersgeraniums, daf
fodils and carnations alike  
as a guide to the good life.

Instead of getting utterly 
absorbed in whatever work 
or works that you may be 
involved in, and practically 
ceasing to breathe because 
there simply isnt enough 
time, take the break you de
serve to appreciate and ab
sorb the fabulous experience 
thats happening all around 
you. Its as simple as that.
The unique culture of CMU 
contributes a lot to the activi
ties one can be involved in or 
merely observe. The archi
tecture (HamerschlagHall lit 
up at night, or backed by a 
brilliant sunset), the front of 
Doherty Hall (with activities 
and energy galore), Schenley 
Park (always the spot to soak 
the sun and nap away home
work horrors), and, if one has 
a more literal interpretation 
of stopping to smell the 
roses, Phipps Conserva
tory (relaxation central), all 
have their legitimate quali
ties of breakhood.
Breaks can be long or short, 
yet regardless of their
length, they serve to divide a 
day that oftentimes may be a 
solid, continuous block of in
tense drudgery.
By scheduling a days 
events without time for 
smelling the flowers, people 
can often reduce their pro
ductivity rather than in
crease it.
Any break can serve as a 
recovery time in between con
centrated sessions of work or 
can simply be spent in the 
leisure time that we all know 
and love.
So let that be a lesson to 
you. Now that all the re
sponsibilities of big boys 
and girls have necessarily 
infiltrated our nap time, we 
should attempt to dispel the 
birds and bees ethic of 
work till you have to go 
potty and reminisce about 
the value we previously 
placed on our recess.

sign major. He welcomes any re
sponsible replies to his column.

Government begins terrorist witch-hunt
Luke Brindle
This October was the 50th an
niversary of the start of the Com
munist witch-hunt.
You werent paying attention 
to this American triumph? Be 
careful,'lovers of democracy and 
free markets  those Redsll 
sneak up on you!
On October 20,1947, the House 
Un-American Activities Commit
tee (HUAC) had its first hearings 
on Communism in America. The 
witch-hunt over the next few 
years resulted in the investiga
tion of millions of Americans for 
subversive activities.
But the real story here has little 
to do with the numbers investi
gated. The real story is about the 
vast popular support for the in
vestigations. At no time since, in 
that climate of mass anti-Communist hysteria, has the Ameri
can public been more united in its 
beliefs. That is all about to change, 
however, and probably within the 
next decade. We no longer have 
Communists to worry about, but 
our new enemy is just as sinister 
 he is faceless,, lurks in the 
shadows, and has no conscience. 
That foe, that wicked un-Ameri
can subversive, is the terrorist.
For you future McCarthys read
ing, there are two things you need 
to carry out an official witch hunt: 
popular support and a legal means. 
The HUAC, the government body, 
was, of course, one of the legal 
mechanisms for weeding out Reds. 
And then there was this hysteria 
we mentioned.
The country  or its establish
ment  had a real threat from the 
Soviets: potential nuclear war, loss 
of trade markets in Asia, Africa, 
and Latin America to Communists, 
and, of course, the overthrow of 
democracies in these places.
Add to that some internal hype, 
and you get a real fear of Commu
nist domination.
In todays country, there is a 
similar fear of terrorism. Fear of 
rogues has stretched back hun
dreds of years. Included on the list 
of historical subversive scum are 
George Washington and his guer
rilla (i.e. terrorist) army and the 
abolitionists, just to name a few.
But it is recently, in the 1980s, 
that terrorism came to the fore
front of popular fear. Most of the 
bad guys were from the Middle 
East. In Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983, 
100 U.S. Marines were killed by a 
bomb. Libya was held respon
sible for numerous attacks on the 
West, including the bombing of a 
Pan Am airplane in 1986. They 
were also thought to be involved
in hijackings and kidnappings. 
The Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization, since the 60s, was 
considered a terrorist gang by 
the U.S., and Palestinian Arabs 
are characterized even today by 
their supposed links to terrorists.
It was not just confined to the 
Middle East: The African National 
Congress and Irish Republican 
Army were long on the U.S. State 
Departments Profile ofTerrorists.
But the kicker has been the last 
few years. This was when terrorof legislation, the second ingre
dient for a witch-hunt: its legal 
mechanism for hunting out and 
prosecuting terrorists.
The Anti-Terrorism Bill did not 
make terrorism illegal  aiding 
foreign terrorists had long been 
criminal. What the bill did, then, 
is give the government new weap
ons in prosecuting terrorists. 
Suspected terrorists  that is, 
people whom the President de
clares terrorists  first have 
their phones tapped and are subWe no longer have Communists to 
worry about, but our new enemy is 
just as sinister  he is faceless ... 
and has no conscience. 
ism has hit the homefront. The 
World Trade Center attack was 
a symbol of terrorist destruc
tion, only to be supplanted a 
year later with the Oklahoma 
City disaster.
And on the heels of such ter
rorist attacks, the U.S. Con
gress passed the Omnibus AntiTerrorist Act in April of 1996  
on the one-year anniversary of 
the Oklahoma bombing  by a 
near-unanimous margin. The 
government has, with this piece
ject to searches without warrants. 
When they get arrested, they lose 
their protection of habeas corpus 
they can be held without charge. 
They have no chance to challenge 
the governments incriminating 
evidence, and this evidence re
mains secret from them even in 
trial and on appeal.
The worst part of this legislation 
is not the unconstitutional denial 
of the rights of the accused, or the 
secret kangaroo courts it will set 
up. The worst part is that 90 per
cent of Congress approved it; the 
worst partis that vast segments of 
the population approve of it; the 
worst part is that it could lead to 
another Red Scare. Instead of our 
radicals having specific ideolo
gies and goals  anarchy, so
cialism, abolition, and civil 
rights  we have randomized 
under the terrorism umbrella.
The image is of an evil man 
whose purpose is the simple de
struction of society, not to bring 
about any specific change.
Never mind that the conqueror 
of apartheid, NelsonMandela, was 
considered an illegal terrorist by 
our government, as was his fellow 
Nobel Prize winner Yasser Arafat.
Irish political leader Gerry 
Adams was not allowed to come to 
America in the 1980s because he 
was a terrorist godfather, but 
his work in bringing peace to Brit
ish-occupied Ireland will probably 
win him the Nobel Prize.
So the point is this: Be careful of 
being too hasty to denounce every
one who challenges the established 
authority as a terrorist. But most 
importantly, be careful of getting 
swept up in anti-terrorist lunacy.

nists, and illegal immigrants.

It has become an issue on this campus 
recently of whether or not the school should 
allow students the day off in order to ob
serve Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s birth
day. President Cohon probably has been 
showered with emails by students asking 
for the day off. I believe that there is a true 
way in which to celebrate this holiday not 
addressed either by simply giving students 
the day off to play, or by refusing to observe 
this federal holiday, but through a day off 
with reflective programs.
The observance of Kings birthday, like 
Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, 
and Columbus Day, was created for the 
expressed purpose of allowing Americans 
the chance to stop and reflect upon our 
national heritage and identity. The true 
meaning of this holiday, much like that of 
the mentioned observed holidays, has been 
lost in the world of department store sales 
and trivialized disputes over what the holi
day means. All these holidays serve a higher 
purpose than to give Mac/s an excuse to 
knock down prices on bedding and bath; 
they are the holidays that serve to remind 
us of who we are as a nation and what we 
have been. Martin Luther King Day is surely 
no exception to this rule. One should not 
spend this day doing homework, sitting in 
class, or recovering from a hangover. In
stead this day should be spent focusing on 
the history of race relations in this country. 
The problems this country faces in dealing 
with race cannot be cured by simply giving 
the day off to schools, banks, and govern
ment offices, nor can it be solved by refusing 
to acknowledge this day and its meaning 
altogether. Kings birthday should be spent 
in a constructive manner by having a dis
course on race and America. By allowing 
students the time to participate in proMark Adato/Tartan Acting Art Co-Editor 
grams that address the issue of race, we 
seek to advance the ideals of King instead of 
ignoring them or forgetting them.
The reluctance of this administration to 
reflect this fact by observing Kings birth
day is frightening. Simply providing pro
grams after classes does not reflect an ob
servance of the holiday, as many students 
simply do not have the time to go to these 
events. If the administration truly wishes to 
observe this holiday correctly, they will give 
the students the time and programs needed.
. The way Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s 
birthday should be spent here at CMU is by 
allowing students to have the day off so that 
they may reflect upon the ideals of this 
great man and the issues of race that still 
confront modern America everyday.
By providing programs to address race, 
and by providing the time in which to take 
part in them, CMU offers a fitting obser
vance to the late King.

Just this past week were the elec
tions. A couple of governorships were 
up for grabs, the mayorship of New 
York City was on the ballot, and a good 
number of local ballot initiatives were 
brought up in various places. It wasnt 
a groundshaking election, but it did 
serve to continue the trend of conserva
tive dominance.
In New York City, Rudy Giuliani 
won in a landslide after promoting and 
enforcing a number of solid crime-fighting initiatives. Owing to a more vigor
ous policy of policing even small crimes, 
the overall crime rate in the Big Apple 
is at a low point unmatched in de
cades. This has led to something of an 
economic boom.
Christine Whitman, the governor of 
New Jersey, narrowly squeaked by to 
victory with only 49 percent of the vote. 
According to national political pundits, 
Whitman, a darling of the media, should 
have had an easy re-election. However, 
Whitman discarded her GOP grassroots 
support. Her militant support of partial-birth abortion and complete disre
gard for the concerns of gun owners led 
to a disaffected voting block which al
lowed her Democrat challenger to come 
extremely close to an upset.
In Virginia, the Republicans gained 
major ground, not only retaining the 
governors mansion, but also taking a 
majority in the state senate, an occur
rence which is a first since Reconstruc
tion. This race was never in doubt, and 
the new governor, Jim Gilmore, struck 
a chord with voters by running on a 
tax-cutting agenda.
In Virginia, people have to pay prop
erty taxes on their cars (no, I am not
kidding), and Gilmore vowed to do 
something about this. Looks like he 
will be given a chance to do so.
There were also a number of ballot 
initiatives around the country. In the 
local elections, there were a few of 
them. The one which had garnered all 
the news was the Regional Renais
sance Initiative, or the stadium tax to 
the non-propagandists.
This, as you probably know by now, 
was an attempt to boost sales taxes 
all over southwest Pennsylvania to 
help fund new stadiums for the Pi
rates and Steelers. It was also meant 
to promote regional infrastructure, 
which is also known as pork. This 
went down to a crushing defeat. Looks 
like people might have seen the light 
on income redistribution and 
Keynesian boondoggles.
The other local initiatives, which did 
pass, included a change in the state 
parole process to make it harder for a 
life sentence to be commuted, a change 
in property tax laws, and a liberalizing 
of the absentee ballot process.
The parole amendment is the only 
one of this bunch which is a good thing. 
The property tax change opens the 
door to progressive property taxes by 
removing Pennsylvanias constitu
tional protections against unequal 
taxation rates, and the liberalizing of 
absentee ballots opens the door to vote 
fraud as has been seen in various elec
tions, including those in Orange 
County, California.
Ml in all it was a pretty good election, 
if youre a conservative. It wasnt per
fect, but are they ever?

Baby-faced rookies adjust to big time hockey
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
Rooks. This past week in the NHL, 
some new faces were sent away for the 
year to the minors. It doesnt mean that 
they wont be called up again, but it does 
mean that they will probably need a few 
years to develop before they can really 
get it going with the big boys. After 10
dont have lots of money or (usually) 
attitude. They live with players fami
lies, or families designated to care for 
them away from home. Rookies make 
me feel old and rookies constantly renew 
my love for the un-jaded elements of the 
sport: a great pass, the first goal, coachs 
hand on your shoulder after a good play.
This year, there were many strong 
draft picks. But those draft picks usu
ally get kicked back into the system 
before they can make an impact in the 
Show. One exception this year was the 
Bruins Joe Thorton, for whom in play
ing in his 11th game this pastweek 
means that this season will officially 
count against his three-year contract 
(about $3 million). But head coach Pat 
Burns told The Boston Globe that he is 
reserving his Rick Pitino rights to deOne of the beauties of hockey is seeing

sion to farm them or roster them  and 
the players remaining then scramble 
for the rest of the year for rookie honors 
and respect.
One of the beauties of hockey is seeing

of the game. Rookies are pure. They
cision reversal and may send the 18- 
year-old down anytime.
When I asked around about good rook
ies, I got email from a local Flyers zealot 
who said that Vaclav Prospal will be the 
one to watch. I recognized the name, 
because the Flyers had brought up the
22-year old before, but not kept him 
rostered. Prospal was drafted in the third 
round in 1993. A left-winger, he was in
the running for rookie of the month 
honors for October (won by Colorado 
defenseman Eric Messier) and led rookie 
scoring as of late last week with 12 
points (three goals, nine assists) in 17 
games. His shot totals are high, indicat
ing that at 6-feet 2-inches tall (although 
a mere 167 pounds) he is getting to net. 
As rookie assist leader, he is doing what 
a winger does best  passing and get
ting the puck in for rebound attempts. 
But he is minus-seven in his rating, 
maybe showing some flub-ups on the 
defensive side of his offense.
But the league chose Messier, a 24- 
year-old d-man with the Avs, to receive 
the first round of top honors. His plussix rating leads all rookie defensemen, 
not hard to do considering how Colorado 
is barreling along in the league
with only three losses.
Though he has only 
played 12 games, he has 
five assists and, importantly, 
two goals. Every team needs 
defenseman who can score and scrum.
Quebec-born and just turned 24, 
Messier played roller-hockey profession
ally in Canada until 1995 when he quit 
and decided to concentrate on ice hockey. 
He was drafted by the Avalanche in
1996 and was rostered for 21 games last 
season  but a rookie stays a ROOKIE 
until he has completed 35 NHL games in 
his career. So since he hadnt reached 
that total last year, he is still considered 
a rook. Messier played six Stanley Cup 
Playoff games with the Colorado Ava
lanche before their elimination in the 
Western Conference Final by the Detroit
Red Wings in 1997. The second-year pro 
was then immediately returned to 
Colorados AHL team in Hershey for the 
completion ofthe Calder Cup Playoffs (AHL 
Championships).
The Washing
ton Capitals have 
two rookies who 
are performing 
well, Richard 
Zednik and Jan 
Bulis. In 16 games,
Zednik 
has 
four 
goals
(tied for _
second in /),
rookie goal-scoring) and Bulis has 
a solid five assists. 
Zednik also is sec
ond in rookie shots 
with 38.
But probably the
most impressive start is that of New 
Jerseys Patrik Elias, who in only 10 
games has scored six goals and has two 
assists. Three of his goals were crucial 
game-winners for the Devils, who are 9- 
5 this season. With almost a-point-agame average for scoring, Elias is cer
tainly on track to win Calder Trophy 
Honors for himself.
Oh, give them all the time in the 
world to prosper. It seems like season 
night, everyone (including me) in the 
Pittsburgh sports press was crying 
out young Patrick Lalimes name as 
the next Roy of goaltending. A lot of 
the time rookies will streak and then 
sputter and, like Lalime, are rarely 
heard from for the rest of their career. 
True NHLers will skate and stay, it 
just may take a little while to get 
there. Not even Bobby Hull was made 
in one day.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  10 November 199711
Tournament closes 
out volleyball year
TOURNAMENT, from page 12
The team is only losing one player to 
graduation this year, but she is their 
leader and captainoutside hitter Brit
tany Rutter. Brittany was a great cap
tain. She was always looking out for 
everyone and working hard every day, 
said sophomore setter Sarah Putaro.
She put so much into the team and 
deserved a great final season as cap
tain, said freshman Jeri Goede, a middle 
hitter for the team.
Her sentiments were echoed by 
Szobota, who recalled a letter that she 
received the summer before her first 
season from Rutter. She offered her 
support and she definitely lived up to it, 
Szobota said. And her serve is also one 
of the best on the team. Theres been 
games where Brittany literally served 
i the other team off of the court.
Im sad to leave because the program
I is improving, and I wish that I could stay
I and grow with it, said Rutter.
Brittany did a tremendous job and 
kept us together as a team. She worked 
hard and improved tremendously and 
Im sad to see her go. It was a pleasure 
coaching her, said Webb.
Look for this young team to go over
.500 next year and improve their UAA 
record (which stood at 1-11 this year) 
a lot. Coach Webb was happy with the 
play of the entire team this season, 
and is optimistic about incoming re
cruits for next year. In addition, fresh
man Rebecca Barkin and sophomore 
Rachelle Abati were seeing more play
ing time as the season rolled on, and 
are expected to be even bigger con
tributors next year.
Notable achievements also came in 
team defensive work, where CMUs 
ranked fifth in the conference. Sopho
mores Ashley Kinsey and Putaro av
eraged almost 2.6 digs per game for 
the season, by far the best numbers on 
the team.
Sarah Putaro ran her ass off for us 
this weekend. As always, she did an 
incredible job. Beyond incredible. She 
has gone from being a very good set
ter, to being one of the best Ive known, 
all in one season, said Szobota.
I think that we really came to
gether as a team this year and we are 
all planning to work hard in the off
season. Our opponents better be look
ing out for us next year, said sopho
more Beth Sekowski.

After losing to Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania Friday in the first dual 
meet of the season, CMUs swimming 
and diving teams came home to break 13 
pool records in 24 events Saturday.
TUP swam well, we swam well, it just 
happens sometimes, said head coach 
David Belowich of the close loss to IUP.
The circumstances surrounding the 
meet on Friday werent conducive to 
good times, said Belowich. [But] the 
kids did a nice job. They stayed focused.
After a full day of classes, the team 
hopped on the bus at 4:30 pm. The bus 
driver took the scenic route, as it took 
two hours to get to IUP. The team ar
rived half an hour before the 7 pm start 
time, but the races were pushed back to 
give CMU time to warm up.
It threw a couple of us off mentally, 
freshman Melissa Schmelzer said of the 
longbusride. [But] the team didreal well.
I knew that after the meet at IUP, after 
the distractions, wed have a pretty good 
meet [Saturday], said Belowich. The Tar
tans would have a good meet. The women 
started things off right again, breaking 
the school record in the 400-yard medley 
for the second time in a week.
Junior Jen Skuly, sophomore Erin 
Rockwell, and freshmen Amy 
Reckdenwald and Julie Tseng swam in at 
4:13.14, also a pool record in the two-year 
old UC pool. Since the end of last season, 
CMU has broken the record with teams 
consisting of six different swimmers.
Thats good versatility and pretty 
good depth, said Belowich. The coach 
now has the difficult task of deciding 
which of the record-breakers will swim 
on the relay.
Itll depend on what our line-up looks 
like ... and also theres a chemistry fac
tor, said Belowich. The competition was 
only the fifth dual-meet in the pool, but
its still uncommon for so many good 
times to come so early.
Most of us were pleasantly surprised 
on Saturday, said Schmelzer, who broke 
the pool record in the 1650-yard free, the 
second event. Schmelzers time of 18:15.68 
is two minutes faster than the old record 
and two seconds off the school record. 
Junior Michelle Kondo, who still holds 
the record, was second; as CMU took the 
top four places in the event. As the day 
went on, the records continued to fall.
Virtually everybody had a very good 
meet, said Belowich. Schmelzer also 
took the pool record in the 200-butterfly 
and was close to the NCAA B-cut in both 
events. Pool records fell to Tseng in the 
200-free, Skuly in the 200-back, sopho
more Kara Cook, Scmelzer, freshman Ann 
Rectenwald, and Kondo in the 400-free.
The men made eight new pool records,
(48.12) pool record once in the open event, 
then again leading off the 400-free 
(47.99). Robinson was joined by fresh
men Jon Alpert and Jonathon Hurst and 
McGuire in setting yet another pool 
record for the 400-free in 3:14.10.
Additional pool records fell to Grove 
City swimmers in the womens 200- 
breast and the mens 1650-free.
Added to the swimming results, jun-^ 
iors Sam Malloy and Don Park took both 
first and second respectively in both th 
1-meter and 3-meter diving events.
The first three dives I did were really 
bad, but my last three dives I did ex
tremely well, said Malloy.
I like him, said Malloy of diving coach 
John Soulakis, a fifth year senior at Pitt. 
Soulakis dove off the 10-meter board in 
NCAA competition last year. Hes pretty 
good at giving feedback, said Malloy.
We had a lot of team unity and we hung In 
there to the end... We had a lot of good 
swims; we had a lot of good runs. Together 
we can win.
 freshman Jason Striner
starting with the 400-medley team of 
sophomore Eric Melymuk, freshmen 
Jason Striner and George Heidinger, 
and senior Mike Foster.
Pool records fell to sophomore Mike 
Robinson in the 200-intermediate 
(2:02.77), Striner (200-breast, 2:17.54), 
junior Jake McGuire (50-free, 21.52), fresh
man Tim Kendig (200-butterfly, 2:01.56), 
and Melymuk (200-back, 2:02.41). The 
men won 148-84, but the last events didnt 
factor into the scoring as coach Belowich 
chose to run them as exhibitions.
Mike Robinson was really outstand
ing, said Belowich.
Robinson tied junior Jake McGuires 
school record and broke the 100-free
Most of my goals are for the 3-metei! 
board, said Malloy, who has seven years of 
gymnastics experience. After placing sixth 
at both the 1-meter and 3-meter boards at 
UAAs in his first season of diving, Malloy 
plans to work on his reverse-back 2-1/2, his 
triple-twisting front 3-1/2, and clean up his 
other dives this season.
It was a really good meet. We had a lot 
of team unity and we hung in there to; 
the end, said Striner.
[The] womens team is improving inleaps and bounds and is going to sur-; 
prise, said Schmelzer.
We had a lot of good swims; we had a 
lot of good runs, said Striner. Together 
we can win.Fast start keys Tartans win

OHara said.
With one of those goals in

Bethany Saturday in the season 
finale and hope they get placed in

end of December.

Rogish. Some

TEAM, from page 12
Min had 21 saves on the night, 
while CMU was being outshot 
almost 3:1.
But Allegheny continued to 
roll over CMU, even with the 
change. They were in the right 
place at the right time for al
most every play, including scor
ing on Kliegman on their first 
shot. He held up to close the 
period, down 8-1.
CMU improved greatly in the 
third, probably because 
Alleghenys first line forwards 
already had a hat trick a piece, 
and the team had finally started 
to rotate in other players. 
Kliegman had 14 saves, almost 
shutting the opponents out in the 
third, except for an early bobble. 
When Duncan left the game, 
freshman Rick Ebert stepped in 
for him on the first line, and man
aged to add some vigor to the 
tiring the squad.
Jon was making some crazy 
saves, but it was too late, said 
Voulgaris. With the loss, CMU 
relinquished its secure hold in 
the division, knocking down their 
overall record to 2-3.
We did do better in the third 
period and killed some penal
ties, thats encouraging, 
Maddalena said about the team.
Some lines just did not click at 
all passing. We really need to 
know what everyone is doing, 
said Voulgaris.
But the loss wasnt any one 
players fault, it was a team let
down. Allegheny wasnt better 
and CMU knew that, but it didnt 
matter. Desire is an integral part 
of hockey and when its not there 
for the team, nothing else any 
individual does matters.
We have to work on not being 
afraid. Their two biggest kids
were all over me, all the team had 
to do was go in with the puck, but 
they didnt, said Berkowitz about 
CMLPs tendency to shy away from' 
hitting, and hesitation with rush
ing the puck down the ice.
We gotta suck it up and go 
on. We are better than we were 
when we started the year, but 
we still have a long way to go, 
said Maddalena.
CMU plays Robert Morris Col
lege at home this Saturday, 8 pm 
and then faces Edinboro away 
Sunday.

Tartans finish sixth 
in UAA tournament
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The CMU womens volleyball team 
finished their season last weekend 
playing in the UAA championship 
tournament at New York University 
by beating the host team to end their 
season sixth overall in the conference. 
It was quite an accomplishment, espe
cially since the team went 0-18 durgrabbed the third game 15-10 and 
iced the next two (15-7 and 16-14)  
winning the final set when senior cap
tain Brittany Rutter bobbled the ball 
over the middle and simply watched it 
drop to the floor on the NYU side.
They took us for granted and we 
hung in there and won. It was just 
tremendous, said coach Julie Webb, 
who brought the team to an overall 9- 
25 season in her second year.
For as long as I can remember, we have 
always been close to beating them. But 
next year it's going to happen. 
 sophomore Steph Szobota
ing the first month of play.
The team opened up the New York 
stint playing Washington University 
and losing in three quick sets, 5-15, 
6-15, 415. Our team played well 
against them, but the Wash. U girls 
have a way of getting into your head, 
said Steph Szobota, sophomore middle 
hitter. The last time that the team 
faced Washington, CMU only man
aged to score 11 points in three games.
The next challenge for CMU came 
when they faced NYU, a team they 
were raring to beat. CMU dropped the 
first game, 10-15, and were creamed 
in the next one, 1-15. During the 
regular season, the team had struggled 
when playing down, but with nothing 
to lose, CMU poured it on.
In the next three sets, errors were 
down and blocking was huge with 
Szobota coming up big at the net; she 
had nine blocks in the match. They
We played our hearts out, said 
Szobota. The rest of the tournament 
was not as rewarding. Although the 
team continued to play hard, the 
rally game with NYU had taken its 
toll. CMU went on to lose to Case 
Western in straight sets, 5-15,2-15 
and 5-15; winning the match would 
have brought them to fourth place in 
the tournament.
In facing Rochester the next day, 
CMU struggled again. The team lost 
the first set, 12-15, but took the sec
ond in rally points, 16-14. Then they 
dropped the next two in close games, 
10-15 and 11-15. Rochester is going 
down next year, without a doubt, 
said Szobota about the final match of 
the season. For as long as I can re
member, we have always been close to 
beating them. But next year its going 
to happen.

CMU rides big first half lead to victory
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
The Tartan football team won 28-13, 
improving to 7-2 Saturday afternoon 
and owning Muhlenberg on both sides of 
the ball early on before holding on for the 
win. After holding the opponent to one 
first down on their initial drive, CMU 
got on the board early, marching 75 
yards to the endzone, most of it on a 54- 
yard bomb from sophomore Russ Clay to 
senior Ricco Parrish. After streaking 
down the middle of the field, Parrish 
caught the ball at the 20, kept his feet, 
and outraced the secondary to the 
endzone. Sophomore Pat OMalley 
missed the extra-point.
Its coming on strong, Parrish said of 
the passing game. Russ is being real 
patient and we have a good game plan.
Clay could do no wrong early on as he 
found TE Chris Barnicle on a 12-yard 
TD strike after the defense forced a 
fumble deep in the opponents territory. 
Senior Chris Neupaver hauled in a pass 
from Clay ofr the 2-point conversion.
Two possessions later, CMU put to
gether their first sustained drive. After 
long runs by Neupaver to the right side, 
sophomore Mike Campie punched the 
ball in from the 1-yard line.
Up until this point, CMUs defense 
had kept the pass-happy Muhlenberg 
offense in check.
Coach [Bodnar] really knows what 
hes doing when he sets up the game 
plan, said senior comerbackPhil OHara. 
The players are out there doing it, but he 
puts us in the right position.
But the game wasnt over yet. The 
opposition entered the game averaging 
over 400 yards of total offense a game. 
They put together their first sustained 
drive, going 33 yards before being shut 
down again.

The Tartans then put together their To make matters worse, the one 
most impressive drive of the afternoon, completion resulted in an injury. Senior 
aided mostly on runs by Neupaver and receiver Rick Steiner ran a hook route, 
Kreuger. The touchdown came on a fourth jumped to catch a high pass, andwashit 
down pass. Parrish adjusted to the ball in hard from behind. Steiner broke his right
the endzone, catching a 25-yarder in front 
of the defender. Up until this point, Clay 
was 7-9 passing for 129 yards, three 
touchdowns, and a 2-point conversion, 
easily his best start as a Tartan. Every
thing seemed to click today, especially in 
the first half, said senior comerback 
Jody Rogish. The rout was on.

By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
There are a few basics in hockey. 
Hit. Skate. Talk to your linemates. 
Keep your sticks on the ice, dont 
let break-aways happen, and 
never allow shooters free space in 
front of the net. Saturday night at 
home, CMU forgot everything and 
it showed when Allegheny Col
lege drummed them into oblivion,
9-1.
CMU lost control of the game 
;early, allowing four unanswered 
goals in the first period alone. 
The team let men skate right into 
the offensive zone and set up 
plays. With only four defensemen 
skating most of the game, sloppy 
work from the CMU second line 
contributed to a majority of the 
opponents goals.
Nobody was covering in front. 
There would be rebounds and three 
guys would be standing in front. 
How can you stop that? said Paul 
Voulgaris, senior captain and 
defenseman. He and fellow senior 
defenseman Dave Mitzel were the 
only kick that the D-line had all 
night, and even then it was inter
mittent. The Allegheny D was big
ger, but not stronger, but too much 
play will wear any man.
Allegheny managed two more 
goals to start the second period, 
frustrating sophomore goaltender 
Gil Min by intentionally crash
ing the net. They knocked him 
down and threw the net off its 
moorings, with no call from the 
referees. In the commotion, Al
legheny took advantage of the 
confusion by putting the puck 
past Min. Overall, they managed 
to frustrate CMU into racking up 
22 penalty minutes, including 
another 10 minute misconduct 
by Adam Duncan  his third in 
three games.
But the first line was not dead. 
Senior Scott Fitzgerald and gradstudent Jonathan Berkowitz 
smacked the opposing squad 
around all they could. Fitzgerald 
was especially effective, pinning 
the larger Allegheny players 
against the boards and opening 
up room for the speedy Berkowitz 
to spirit the puck down ice.
Halfway through the second, 
down 6-0, Voulgaris and fresh
man defenseman Aaron Hula con
trolled the disk deep, then got it to 
Berkowitz sprinting up the right 
side. He blew through the neutral 
zone and all alone threw the puck 
backhand into the net, scoring the 
lone CMU goal of the evening.
We were mostly faster than 
them, but didnt do anything with 
it. We can do it, when were deep, 
but they controlled the neutral 
zone, and that was our problem, 
said Berkowitz.
Sophomore P.J. Grzywacz 
was the saving grace of the sec
ond line throughout the game, 
rushing the puck hard when
ever he could and trying to do 
everything alone, including 
move the puck through a tight 
Allegheny defense. Errant 
passes up the middle from his
linemates didnt make his job 
any easier.
If I didnt go after it, I didnt 
get it, that was about it, said 
Grzywacz. His hard-hitting, 
stand-up style struck fear into 
the Allegheny lines, but couldnt 
spark the CMU players enough 
to rally.
After Allegheny scored a powerplay goal a few minutes after the 
Berkowitz tally, head coach Fred 
Maddalena pulled Min and sent 
in grad-student Jon Kliegman.

Tartans show confidence about upcoming Dickinson course
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
The Tartan mens cross-coun
try team ran to a third place finish 
in the UAA championships Sun
day, November 2. Brandeis fin
ished first with 22 points, followed 
by Washinton U. (59) and CMU 
(80). It was the teams best show
ing at the meet in recent years.
Coach [Gary] Meckley knows 
what hes doing, so we pretty 
much go along with whatever he 
says, Kriechbaum said of the 
coachs workouts. The team has 
certainly come together, as the 
top five runners finished within 
22 seconds of each other.
Sophomore Bryan Myer led
the team over the 8 K course, 
finishing 12th in 26:09, but se
nior Josh Donner was just two 
places and two seconds behind. 
Senior Maliek Washington, 
sophomore Kristo Kriechbaum, 
and junior Kenn Oldham cap
tured places 17-19 in 26:25, 
26:27, and 26:31 respectively.
Meckley has the tough task of 
trimming three runners from the 
competing roster.
At regionals, a team consists of 
seven athletes, but all 10 runners 
who competed at UAAs are still 
practicing with the team.
This whole season, on any 
given day, any five guys could 
score, said Kriechbaum. Coach 
will probably take eight [runners],
in case one of us gets injured at 
the last minute.
Were all looking forward to 
the Regionals meet and prepar
ing ourselves mentally, since we 
have to race as a team, said 
Meyer. CMU faces a dominant 
Haverford team, ranked fifth in 
the nation, and also must race 
the College of New Jersey. CMU 
was ranked 19th before the UAA 
meet and is trying to get to the 
national meet, where they fin
ished 16th last year. The top two 
winners from the Regional meet 
will go on to compete Nationals.
New Jersey beat us this year, 
said Meyer. I think they had three 
guys in front of our first, but thats 
not to say we cant change that.
I think weve got a great shot, 
said Kriechbaum, noting that the 
course at Regionals wont be as 
tough as the hilly courses that 
the team is accustomed to. If we 
run like we did at UAAs, [quali
fying for nationals] shouldnt be 
a problem.
Were all getting psyched for 
next week, said junior Kelan 
Wieloch. Were all going to have 
[personal best times] and shock 
the region.
CMU will have the advantage 
of being familiar with the course. 
The meet will be this weekend at 
Dickinson College.
We go there at least twice a 
year, said Meyer. Im looking 
forward to it.
Women win UAAs 
with team depth
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
The CMU womens cross
country team won its second 
UAA championship Sunday, 
November 2, but it wasnt easy. 
Junior Maureen McGranaghan 
paced the team, finishing third 
in 18:23 over the Franklin Park 
course in Boston. Senior Mel
issa Lott, and juniors Marga
ret Powers and Andrea Byrnes 
soon followed in fifth, sixth, 
and eighth,in 18:50,18:52, and 
19:01 respectively.
But CMUs second tier of run
ners came on strong, led by 
sophomore Melissa Sloan, who 
finished 30th in 20:24. The comI felt sick during the first 
mile, said Powers.
It was actually sort.of a dan
gerous course because the foot
ing was muddy. It was actually 
one of my slower times. I was 
really thankful that I was able 
to finish the race, said Currid, 
whos happy to be healthy after 
being bothered by perpetual 
leg injuries this season.
With one championship se
cured, the undefeated women 
look forward to Regionals this 
weekend on a smoother course 
at Dickinson College.
Franklin Park is really beau
tiful. Its right there where the 
zoo is. Its different, a change of 
pace, said McGranaghan. But
We have a shot at first, but... it will 
require several good races. 
junior Maureen McGranaghan
bined places of the top five times 
just beat out Emorys, 52-57.
I wasnt happy with my time, 
said Sloan, who has a personal 
best of 19:40. Less than a mile 
into the race, Sloan passed gradu
ate student Becky Buchheit, who 
usually places in the top five for 
the team. Buchheit was unable 
to finish the race.
I got really scared because 
that made me the fifth run
ner, said Sloan. [Coach Dario 
Donatelli] was screaming for 
me to go faster.
It was awesome. It was really, 
really exciting to be on the same 
course as all the big meets, said 
sophomore Liz Currid, CMUs 
seventh finisher. The Franklin 
Park course was difficult because 
of rain, and according to Currid, 
it was actually 17 meters longer 
than the standard 5 K
Im happy with [the results], 
but I think weve hadbetterraces 
as a team, said McGranaghan. 
Her teammates agreed.
Dickinsons a good course; you 
know what to expect.
Its kind ofhard to tell [which 
is tougher], Powers said when 
asked to compare the course for 
the UAA meet and the one at 
Dickinson. We ran Franklin 
Parks when it was soggy and 
drenched and weve run 
Dickinson so many times. 
Actually its not a bad 
course, Sloan said of the 
Dickinson course. Its a fast 
course; Im pretty excited. 
We definitely have a shot at 
first, but theres going to be com
petition from the College of New 
Jersey, McGranaghan said. It 
will require several good races. 
The Tartans go into the meet 
with guarded optimism. They 
were ranked fifth nationally 
before UAAs and have yet to 
lose this season.
Right now were ranked first 
in the region, said Currid. 
[But] something can always 
go wrong.

Program fosters 
leadership skills
By KENNETH J. KRAEMER
Tartan Contributing Editor
The Office of Student Af
fairs wants you to invest in 
yourself. At least thats one of 
the goals of its ongoing Di
mensions program, which is 
enjoying its inaugural semes
ter as a resource for personal 
and professional development 
for members of the CMU com
munity. It is one of the many 
programs offered by Student
reach, most of which continues 
appropriately to be centered on 
hall floors, student groups, and 
other affiliations.
Church said that this se
ries exists in addition to pro
gramming available in resi
dential halls, and is of par
ticular value to students if 
they are not involved in cam
pus residential living.
Offering eight sessions a 
week, touching maybe 50-60 
students in a week, is a nice

Life and the Office of Student 
Affairs that promote leader
ship skills among students.
In general, were hoping to 
provide a series for the campus 
community to come together to 
develop personal/professional 
skills, said Jennifer Church, 
assistant to the dean of Student 
Affairs and administrator of the 
Dimensions program.
The program is a series of 
hour-long - seminars dealing 
with a broad range of topics 
that are intended to impart 
basic skills and awareness to 
participants. The series deals 
with topics that range from re
search opportunities at CMU 
to stress management to con
flict resolution to nutrition.
I think Dimensions has been 
a great addition already, even 
in its infancy, said Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Af
fairs. Dimensions is only a very 
small part of the personal and 
professional development outcomplement to those other ef
forts, perhaps laying a founda
tion for interest in other such 
initiatives, said Murphy.
The sessions, each offered six 
times per semester, are prag
matic and informative in their 
dealing with current thought 
and research on a given topic. 
[I invested] a great deal of time 
and thought thinking about the 
program in advance, said 
Michael Groat, coordinator of 
Student Life and presenter of 
the Wellness component of the 
Dimensions program.
During his program, Groat in
troduced a model for wellness and 
discussed how each component of 
wellness emotional, occupa
tional, physical, etc.  impacted 
other components of wellness. 
After a wellness test which each 
member of the audience took, the 
group discussed strategies for 
improving personal wellness in 
the context of life at CMU.

Emerging Leaders attain perspective
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
Obstacles are those frightful things you 
see when you take your eyes off the goal.
These words by Henry Ford define an impor
tant lesson gained by last years participants in 
the Carnegie Mellon Emerging Leaders Pro
gram, a program designed to promote leader
ship development among first-year students.
The six-week program is held during the 
spring semester and is designed so that

first-year students can both explore their 
leadership potential and their personal 
potential by focusing on ideas such as deci
sion making, creativity, and teamwork.
The Emerging Leaders Program was es
tablished in January 1996 and interest in 
the program has significantly grown since 
then, according to Kevin Hughes, the coor
dinator of Student Life for Leadership and 
Service Learning.
[The program] connects the students 
to the campus in a different way and it 
provides them with the opportunity to 
pursue a non-academic education, said 
Hughes. It also helps the students learn 
a lot more about personal leadership, 
which helps with adjustment to college 
life, according to past participant Kate 
Williams, a sophomore electrical and com
puter engineering major.
The program begins with an overnight 
retreat, which consists of either a ropes 
course or various adventure activities, help
ing the participants begin their journey in 
personal exploration and focus on team
work in small and large groups.
Unless you really have to put your strat
egies to the test, you never know which 
skills are the most valuable for you or 
which [skills] other people respond well 
to, said Margot Bloomstein, a sophomore 
communication design major, who partici
pated in the program last year.
The retreat greatly helped the partici
pants build relationships in a completely 
different atmosphere than is possible on the 
campus, which helped facilitate better com
munication in the sessions that followed, 
according to past participant Sumit Lohia, a 
sophomore international student majoring 
in electrical and computer engineering.
At the beginning [of the retreat], we all 
wrote down our short-term and long-term 
goals and put them in an envelope to open at 
the end and review what we had set out to 
do. It was a very good way of focusing on our 
goals and in a way helped us to reach them, 
said Williams.
Another activity the students took part in 
was a value auction in which they had to 
prioritize values, deciding which were the 
most important in order to succeed with lim
ited resources.
This really helped everyone understand 
what they want out of life. The concepts were 
presented in a playful way, which made the 
impact even stronger, said Lohia.
According to Lohia, one of the most effective 
activities that took place during the program 
was the very first activity, in which the facili
tator organized a simulation of surviving 
through college. A 40-foot line was marked 
off, with the beginning representing orienta
tion and the end representing graduation. 
Groups of students were given blocks of wood 
as resources.
The students were instructed to get from 
the beginning to the end without touching the 
ground. Any resources which were unusedwere taken away.
This simulation helped us realize that if 
you are not using your resources well, your 
journey through college will be very rough. 
We learned that one of your best resources in 
college is your friends, and if you are not 
aware of your resources and do not use theirf, 
the journey will be much harder to complete, 
said Lohia.
It helped us as freshmen to realize that 
success in college is not just getting yourself 
to graduate, but getting eveyone you started

rganization heads explore leadership qualitie
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Contributing Editor
I dont think anyone wakes up 
in the morning and says, Im 
going to be a student leader 
now,  said Bryon Krug, stu
dent body president and a se
nior electrical and computer 
engineering major. People decide to take 
on leadership roles because they think 
that their participation in that role will 
have a positive effect.
The 150 student organizations 
on campus provide the opportu
nity for students to learn leader
ship skills. Leadership workshops 
and seminars can help 
leaders shape their 
abilities, but the expe
rience of leading an or
ganization at the uni
versity level is invalu
able. Only by taking on 
the role of leader can 
one really understand 
the part. By sharing 
their experiences, cam
pus leaders help to ex
plain what makes a
strong leader and what a leadership 
position entails.
With leadership comes responsibil
ity. Any leader, especially a person 
with limited experience, may find himor herself in the unfamiliar position 
where he or she is faced with making 
decisions that affect many and 
have broad repercussions.
By far the best training is 
experience  you have to get 
your feet wet, said Brian 
Bluth, president of Student 
Dormitory Council and a se
nior biology major. Every 
student leader makes mis
takes, especially at the begin
ning. Ive certainly had my share, and 
Ive learned a lot from them.
Organization, ability to delegate re
sponsibility, patience, and tolerance are 
some of the qualities any. leader must 
possess to be successful. For each leader, 
the extent to which he or she possesses 
these skills plays a role in the type of 
leadership he or she presents.
It is really important to listen to 
people, said Renee Littleton, president 
of Spirit and a senior chemistry major. I 
maintain the practice of listening to ev
erything and everyone first and then 
making a decision. Also, people must 
feel like they can talk to me as a leader 
and as a friend.
I think that the best qualities I 
have are that I am very organized 
and motivated to make 
change, said Lori 
VanNewkirk, president of 
the Panhellenic Council 
and a senior social and de
cision sciences major. I 
think that these qualities, 
plus having time and energy 
to want to do a good job in the 
position, are essential to being 
a leader on campus.
Student leaders face the added 
pressure of m anaging their time between 
school and leadership responsibilities.
Campus leaders need to have really 
good time management skills. The ones 
who cant manage their time either 
end up letting 
their group down 
or doing really 
poorly academi
cally, said Krug.

College Briefs I Students must break silence about rape
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Though the Campus Police re
port indicates that no incidents of 
sexual assault occur at CMU, one 
must remember that almost half 
of the rapes committed nation
wide go unreported.
Because of this fact, CMUs Stu
dent Life office and Sexual Assault 
Advisory Team joined forces last 
Wednesday to inform the commu
nity about sexual assault at the 
annual Breaking Silence seminar, 
a three hour program presented in 
three segments.
Though the statistics portray 
CMU as exceptional in that sexual 
assault does not take place here, 
there are some who insist that the 
statistic is misleading.
Most of the data on assault is 
only for survivors who have chosen 
to prosecute, which, unfortunately, 
is very few. Cases of sexual assault

Shakespeare takes spotlight in Last Lecture
By ANAND MARATHE
Tartan Staffwriter
Before John Hart the actor could take the 
podium last Monday to deliver his final 
lecture, Lewis Middleman explained to the 
Adamson Wing audience, who were also 
actors, that he felt a little out of place being 
the only real person in the room.
Middleman, a former student of Harts 
and the first male English major to have 
graduated from the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences (H&SS), was poking 
fun at the Last Lecture series, and the 
thought of Hart, an emeritus professor of 
English, actually giving his last lecture. 
Middlemans introduction called to mind 
the purpose of the Last Lecture series, 
which is for the speaker to expound upon 
the subject he or she would want to share in 
their final speech.
Harts Last Lecture topic revolved around 
Shakespeare, Harts specialty in English. 
In his years here, he has gained recognition 
for giving veiy interesting lectures, and 
this one was no exception. Hart covered 
many areas of Shakespearian interest durLisette Miller-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager

some of Shakespeares works, critical views, 
and some of the attempts at rewriting 
Shakespeare for more modem times.
I found the lecture [to be] veiy interest
ing. Itisthefirstlectureof[Harts]rvegone

trial management major.
Hart began by discussing his career at 
CMU, which spans 51 years, and focused on 
the Shakespeare group that he helped to 
form. Hestressedthebeginningsofthegroup, 
and that there were many things that he took 
from them and they learned from him.
The major element of his discussion, 
however, was the way that some have tried 
to resurrect Shakespeare for a modem 
time. According to Hart, there have been 
two horrible attempts to bring Shakespeare 
to more contemporary times, one in the 
18th century and one in the 20th century. 
He also told of an attempt to make an 
edition ofFamily Shakespeare based on the 
popular game show Family Feud. All of 
these attempts, said Hart, were perver
sions of the texts.
I was expecting to hear a lecture on what 
the person is interested in. [The lecture] 
was what I expected, said Tseng. I gained 
a better understanding of Shakespeare 
and what he stands for.
Hart also went into a detailed review of
King Lear as a study of old age plagued by 
pure power. He followed King Lears life 
and the events surrounding it, explaining 
his interpretation of the events.
Shakespeare was not a preacher, teacher, 
or moralist, said Hart. He also cited quotes 
fromtheplay,andshowedhowShakespeares 
use of words are crucial to his works.
One desire Hart expressed in his lecture 
was that at some point, one of the Last 
Lectures should be given by someone of a 
younger age. According to him, everybody 
has something good to say, and perhaps a 
future Last Lecturer should not necessar
ily be an older faculty member.
The Last Lecture Series creates an op
portunity for the campus to gather to hear 
a distinguished members views on issues 
of pervasive, often philosophical, impor
tance to us all, said Michael Murphy, dean 
of Student Affairs, the office which orga
nizes the Last lecture series. These lec
tures have a special place because they are 
not focused on immediate issues, but rather 
on grander overarching themes. The fact 
that they are so profoundly thought-pro
voking makes them of special value.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  10 November 1997L3Society will limit female president
PamgIibh cvu Uycv
by Elizabeth Irvine
While keeping up with election cover
age, I noticed how many women were 
increasingly visible in the race. Since first 
ladies have been taking a more active role 
in White House activities, it seems fea
sible that a woman could be on the Presi
dential ticket in the 
next election. Even 
Bob Dole recently 
made the comment 
that he could see his 
wifes name making 
the Republican ticket 
in the future. While 
many people may 
think the hard part 
would be getting on 
the ballot or getting 
elected, the real prob
lem emerges after the 
first female Presi
dent takes office.
The fact is, women 
and Presidents do 
have something in 
common  they are 
both socially constructedimages. Be
cause there has 
never been a female 
leader of this coun
try, the first female President will be 
analyzed in terms of the male standard. 
Like any profession that is male-domi
nated, every mistake, every move, will 
be under scrutiny. Her mistakes wont 
be the mistakes of a President, but of a 
female President, and there will be no 
escaping this title. The first woman Presi
dent will have to work so hard to over
come the stigma of being the first woman 
in office that she might work against 
womens interests.
Women are viewed as passive 
nurturersnot pro-active leaders. They 
are constructed as objects of beauty or as
mothers, and their actions are rational
ized because of their femininity. Presi
dents have expectations as well. The 
idea of a charismatic strongman is one 
that must always be maintained in the 
Presidency. The Chief Executive must 
be in control, be rational, and be au
thoritative. After all, he is Commander 
in Chief of the Armed Forces; therefore; 
he is unquestionably aggressive with 
policy and firm in his convictions.
The President and women are highly 
visible figures but in veiy different ways. 
Women are under constant surveilance 
and have been historically judged on their 
appearance. Therefore, the outward ap
pearance of a female President will be 
dissected. Her clothing, appearance, hair,

The attention Hillarys hair gets doesnt 
bode well for the first female President.
courtesy New York Times 
The appearance of the most powerful 
U.S. law official is constantly mocked.
and speaking manner will have to border a 
fine line of appropriateness. Considering 
the amount of attention the press gives to 
Hillarys hair, a female President will be 
doomed to hair publicity. Every change, 
cut, or slight coloring will be a scandal.
A female President of the U.S. wont 
be too pretty or she wont be taken seri
ously  she will be seen as a Miss 
America type with no brains. But on the 
other hand, she cant be too ugly. Look at 
the commentary on Supreme Court Jus
tice Ruth Bader-Ginsberg and the highest-ranking law official in the country, 
Attorney General Janet Reno. The fact
that they are not beauty queens has 
been a big issue and made them the 
brunt of many jokes.
The President needs to be a family 
man, and this will be expected of a 
female President as well. But the role 
of a father and the role of a mother are 
different. How will this play out in the 
White House? The Presidents place in 
the First Family is one of a figurehead. 
Will a female President become a fig
urehead mother? The problem of the 
contradiction of mother and political 
leader has not been solved yet. It is 
still an either/or situation for women 
in the workplace. Mom power is the 
traditional root of white, middle-class 
feminism, and our first woman presi
dent will definitely 
be white and 
middle-class. Her 
experience of moth
erhood will in a way 
justify her leader
ship, but of course, 
she will have to 
have the profes
sional credentials 
as well.
The first female 
President will be 
placed in a delicate 
situation when she 
meets the leader of 
a country where 
women are op
pressed. It is pos
sible that because 
she is a woman, the 
leader of the free 
world might wear a 
veil in Afghanistan. 
That is, unless the 
whole sticky situation is remedied by 
the meetingtakingplacein, say, Geneva. 
The interesting aspect of the situation is 
that the leaders of other countries might 
perceive afemaleU.S. President in such 
a way that it will alter the relationships 
the U.S. has with those countries.
It is comical, in a way, to invert the 
gender of the President. The expecta
tions of our leaders seem weird and 
ridiculous when we change the sex. I 
dont know when the election of a fe
male President will occur, but it will be 
very interesting when it does. I hope 
she knows what she is getting into.
Festival focuses on 
empowering women

Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Womens sexuality is something that 
isnt discussedeven women dont know 
how to talk about themselves sexually. 
And its important because how you feel 
about your body is how you feel about 
yourself, said Janel Hamner, a junior 
English and chemistry double major and 
organizer of this years 
Womens Festival, 
which took place this 
past Saturday. Spon
sored by the Womens 
Center, the festival of
fered a full day of lec
tures, workshops, and 
panel discussions that 
focused less on womens 
issues in the academic 
arena and more on per
sonal issues, from self 
defense and rape sur
vival to female mastur
bation and sex toys.

Wilding, one of the founders of the firsi 
Womens Studies program at California 
State University at Fresno in the 70s! 
has been teaching art at CMU for three 
years now. Through her work she has 
tried to represent the female experience 
sans the cultural contexts and steregtypes that are generally attached to ther$ i 
The program was based on an ideft 
of Simone de Beauvoir that woman is
more
based, said member of the Womens Cen
ter Erica Brusselars, a senior math major. 
I dont think [the Womens Center festi
val] was about that. We wanted programs 
that were more empowering in nature. 
According to Hamner, programming 
about womens issues on campus, which 
generally act as a useful resource for 
addressing problems that women are 
faced with in certain settings, tend to be 
negative in scope. Its good information, 
but its not very positive. We wanted to 
show feminism is applicable, she said. 
Its something you use in your work. 
Speakers such as visiting professor of 
art Faith Wilding were perfect examples 
of women who have successfully incorpo
rated their ideas of feminism into their 
careers. Through a lecture and slide pre
sentation on the historical development of 
feminism and art from the 70s into the 
90s, she traced her own achievements as 
an artist and educator.

made, not born,  said Wilding. [This 
is] a really important issue that femi
nism uses  that women are a socially 
constructed category. All realms and 
feelings come about through social con
ditioning.
Sacrifice, one of her earlier worlds 
from her time at Fresno, is a room-size# 
installation that consists of a sculpture: 
of her body at the foot of the cross. The 
sculpture, which is torn at the torso to 
reveal her inner organs, brings together 
issues associated with womens bodies 
through images of roses, blood, and birds.- 
Women have to tell the truth about 
their bodies, but they are held back from 
[doing so] because men get freaked out 
by it, said Wilding.
Wilding showed slides of her perfor
mance pieces she exhibited at Woman 
House, a 20-room space she rented wi1$i.

Following the retreat, topical 
sessions are held once a week in 
the evenings to focus on various 
components of leadership devel
opment through small 
groupwork, lectures, case stud
ies, or other interactive activi
ties.
The sessions are facilitated by 
CMU faculty, staff, and admin
istration, from departments 
such as the Office of Student 
Activities, Office of Student Life, 
and the Career Center. The pro
gram thus allows students to 
interact with several different 
members of the community, in
cluding facilitators and other 
students, many of whom are 
outside of the students own ma
jor. According to Hughes, this 
increases learning.
I could discuss issues with 
[the other participants] which 
were beyond the ones discussed 
in the classroom, which helped 
me understand them better as 
well as form a niche of my own, 
said Lohia. This spring, the 
topical sessions will focus on 
the areas of integrity and val
ues, flexibility and change, cre
ativity, and decision making.
The people who have gone 
through [the program] have 
taken several leadership posi
tions at CMU, whether they 
are positions in student orga
nizations, or as student staff 
members such as RAs or TAs, 
or as student office assistants, 
said Hughes.
Williams said that her par
ticipation in the program last 
year greatly influenced her de
cision to become an RA. The 
leadership classes given here 
are a necessary part of being a 
positive influence on your com
munity, said Williams.
Past participants also are in
vited to be student facilitators 
for the program to help out 
with the activities. After go
ing through this program and 
other similar programs, I feel I 
have gained a lot which I can 
offer back to other students, 
said Lohia. It has changed my 
leadership style and has ex
posed me to new ones, which 
has helped me become an inte
gral part to any organization.
Any first-year student who 
is in good academic standing 
and has been enrolled at CMU 
for at least a semester is eli
gible to apply. Participants are 
chosen based on their time 
commitment, involvement in 
activities, work experience, 
volunteer work, honors, and 
awards, as well as their rea
sons for wanting to be part of 
the program and their goals as 
a student at CMU.
Nominations for the pro
gram are taken from deans, 
department heads, RAs, CAs, 
and student organizations, in 
order to identify some stu
dents who will benefit from 
the program and to encourage 
them to apply.
However, all first-year stu
dents interested in the pro
gram and further developing 
their leadership and personal 
potential are highly encour
aged to apply.
Everyone has leadership po
tential within them, and it is 
important to cultivate that, 
said Hughes.
All freshmen interested in 
participating in the Emerg
ing Leaders Program are wel
come and encourged to pick 
lip an application in the Stu
dent Life Office. The com
pleted applications are due on 
November 24, 1997.

house represented a different stereo
type of femininity such as motherhood 
and menstruation. The house became a 
sort of shrine and a prison, she said.
Other presentations shifted in focus, 
from the work of other artists to discus
sion-oriented sessions on female sexual
ity. Representatives from Eves Garden, 
a sex boutique based in New York City, 
presented two discussions, one on sex 
toys and another on masturbation. We 
brought [Eves Garden] to the festival 
because they are popular, for one thing, 
said Hamner. But also because we need 
to create a place to talk positively about 
women as sexual beings.
Mara Gottlieb of Eves Garden opened 
her session with an ice breaker where 
she asked participants to list all the 
synonyms for male masturbation they
could think of and then, list the same 
for female masturbation. The ratio of 
names, as she demonstrated, was an 
uneven 20:3. Her point was that there 
is no context for discourse on the sub
ject of female masturbation.
Approximately 200 students turned 
out for the lectures, said Hamner. The 
Womens Center hopes to create simi
lar programming in the next year, but 
according to Hamner, it will only be 
possible if there is enough interest 
generated. Most people get excited at 
the idea of having a festival, but a lot 
of people burn out half way through, 
she said.
Although the discussion group Cof
fee Talk was recently canceled, 
Hamner said the Womens Center 
hopes to create other such forums on 
campus next semester.
Organization leaders examine CMU issues
LEADERS, from page LI
I think that because of the time com
mitment regarding classes at CMU, hold
ing a leadership position can sometimes 
be a draining experience, said 
VanNewkirk. However, it is a great 
community and the number of students 
on campus make it possible to really do 
some interesting activities and reach 
out to other community members.
The student leaders became leaders of 
their respective organizations because 
they were interested in having the abil
ity to make change. They often saw prob
lems with the way the organizations 
were being run and wanted to make a 
positive change.
Being a student leader means to moti
vate yourself and others to achieve a set 
of goals, whatever those goals may be, 
said Bluth. I became president of [Stu
dent Dormitory Council] because I love 
the organization and wanted to take it to 
new heights. Helping improve residence 
life on campus was certainly a motivat
ing factor, but it was my desire to see the 
organization succeed at everything we do 
that really drove me to the top.
The leaders also can use their positions 
to make changes to the campus commu
nity. Issues on campus that affect mem
bers of organizations can be explored and
changed under their leadership.
This campus is not as representa
tive of minorities as it should be, said 
Littleton. However, I feel that groups 
on this campus are here to promote 
cultural identity. They also serve as 
tools for educating not only minori
ties, but the majority as well.
Student apathy is often cited as a 
problem at the University. With stu
dents too busy to take an active role in 
issues affecting the campus community, 
leaders face the challenge of gaining 
interest and support for their activities.
I just think that most students dont 
think that their participation in some
thing will make a difference or that 
they will be unaffected by the result of 
an issue or event. People at Carnegie 
Mellon are very busy. They dont have 
time for things that they cant change 
or will not be affected by, said Krug.
While leaders provide direction for 
a group of people, they are just one 
part of the organizations they lead. 
No matter how strong their skills 
may be, leaders must share their re
sponsibility with others and not be 
afraid to ask for help.
A leader must realize that it is the 
people of the organization who make it 
work, not the leader, said Littleton.

They danced, they sang, they 
showed off their muscles. They dem
onstrated their creativity, and they 
made their fraternities proud as they 
all tried to be the one to come away 
with the crown.
Last Saturday night in Rangos 
Ballroom, representatives from 12 
fraternities on campus vied for the 
coveted title of Mr. Fraternity. 
However, the point of Mr. Frater
nity, sponsored by Kappa Alpha 
Theta, wasnt just for entertainment 
purposes or to showcase the talents 
of a few select individuals.
Kappa Alpha Theta holds the Mr. 
Fraternity contest each year in or
der to raise money to donate to the 
Central Ohio Lung Association. This 
is done in memory of Karin Johnson, 
a former sophomore at CMU 
and Theta sister who passed 
away in November 1984 due to 
a fatal asthma attack. The 
Central Ohio Lung Association 
has since created the Karin 
Johnson Memorial Asthma Re
search fund, and this year 
$3,400 was donated to the fund 
from money raised through the 
Mr. Fraternity contest.
So it was for two reasons that 
people gathered in Rangos on 
Saturday night to see who 
would win the title Mr. Fra
ternity. First, they wanted to 
be entertained, and second, at 
least for many people, they 
wanted to support a worthy 
philanthropy. Its a lot of fun, 
but the most important part is 
for people to realize that theyre 
not just here to see [the show]. 
Theyre here to raise money for 
a good cause, said Yuan Qiong Wang, 
a first-year student in H&SS.

From the very beginning of the competi

Skiadas, a sophomore industrial i

Upson, a senior IM major of Delta  
Upsilon. Ryan Christian, Mr. Theta ( 
Xi and a sophomore IM major, even  
graced the crowd with his interpre| 
tation of the song Barbie Doll. 
Members of the audience reacted to j 
the acts in various ways, and booing, i 
clapping, and cheering could all be i 
heard simultaneously. I think that i 
theres a lot more talent than last i 
year, and although its hard to be; 
lieve, people are more polite than last ; 
year, said Jared Schneider, a junior  
industrial design major.
Mr. Fraternity ended with a ! 
formalwear segment followed by a ; 
question-and-answer period. Each j 
contestant was asked onfe 
question and given a few 
seconds to answer. For ex
ample, Richard Simmons, 
a junior chemical engineeri 
ing major and Mr. Pi \ 
Kappa Alpha, was asked j 
what three things he would { 
like to have with him if he 
were to be stranded on a j 
deserted island forever, j 
Beast, PiKA, and j 
Chatham, he responded. > 
In order to decide who j 
would become Mr. Fraterj 
nity for 1997, participants j 
were judged on five differj 
ent categories based on fac\ 
tors including originality, j 
stage presence, and qualj 
ity, and given points for each / 
competition by a group of i 
judges. In addition, the au! 
dience was given the oppor: 
tunity to vote, and these votes were { 
tallied and added to the point total. j 
When all the points were totaled and all \ 
the votes were counted, Metzner, Mr. j 
Phi Kappa Theta, also known as Elvis, : 
was named Mr. Fraternity for 1997. ;
Im proud of this event because it f 
pulls together a lot of the Greek comj 
munity, and people outside of the j
and Sigma Phi Epsilon brother, came 
out doing flips, handsprings, and other 
gymnastic maneuvers to amaze the au
dience, while others danced and often 
went a little farther than just dancing. 
Sam Abhyankar, a junior psychology

PROGRAMS, from page LI
Despite the goals of the Dimen
sions program, it seems to suffer 
from poor attendance. The Wellness 
program was attended by only three 
students, and the Nutrition pro
gram had only five participants. 
However, Church commented that 
attendance is growing.
Attendance is an issue for some 
of the Dimensions programs, 
said Groat. We are currently re
viewing those programs with 
lower attendance numbers and 
asking the critical questions of, 
Is this program meeting a per
ceived need? Are there better 
ways of marketing this program? 
and What can we do to increase 
awareness and understanding of 
the benefits of participation?
We [Dimensions] have had 
over 300 students participate in 
the various programs, which has 
been encouraging. Our range of 
participation in any given ses
sion on any given night has been 
from zero to over 30, but our am
bition is to have 8-12 students at 
each session, said Murphy, who 
presents the session Decision 
Making and Problem Solving.
Though the Dimensions pro
gram does not specifically work 
to be a leadership program, the 
topics dealt with work to instill 
leadership skills. I believe that 
if you look at the array of pro
grams offered ... you will find in 
each of them the necessary skills 
to become competent and suc
cessful leaders in todays globally 
competitive world, said Groat.
The Student Life office, however, 
offers several programs similar to 
Dimensions that focus solely on lead
ership and its skills and concepts.
Everyone has a leader within, 
said Kevin Hughes, coordinator 
f Student Life and administra
tor of leadership programs. Were 
here to help cultivate that.
The Emerging Leaders (CMEL) 
program and the Carnegie Mell
on Leadership Institute (CMLI) 
are both longer-term programs 
offered to help qualified appli
cants develop as leaders and ex
plore what it means to express 
personal leadership capabilities, 
according to Hughes.
For both programs, partici
pants must either be nominated 
by an outside party or nominate 
themselves, and then must un
dergo an application process to 
enter the program.
According to Hughes, the 
CMEL program targets secondsemester freshmen and usually 
involves 50-plus students. The 
series lasts six weeks in the spring 
and is a lecture-based program 
that focuses on the development 
of leadership skills.
The CMLI program delves 
deeper into the concepts and 
thoughts behind leadership. The 
program deals with such issues 
as leadership, followership, and 
integrity, and typically draws 
around 15 to 18 participants.
According to Hughes, a thirdtier, immersion-based program 
is currently in development, 
where students will spend three 
to five days working on leader
ship issues. Student Life is work
ing with the Executive Educa
tion program in GSIA to develop 
this program and find appropri
ate speakers.
Not everyone is enthusiastic 
about the leadership programs 
offered by Student Life. The pro
gram was just dumb. I really 
didnt get anything valuable out 
of it, said one past CMLI partici
pant, who prefers to remain 
anonymous. This participant ex
pressed that some of the prob
lems arose from the way partici
pants were selected, noting that 
some people were selected as 
natural leaders, while others were 
people who needed to be lead
ers. However, this student also 
said, I met some great people 
[through the CMLI] who I other
wise would not have met.
For students who are not inter
ested in formal, prolonged lead
ership programs or the commit
ment that is attached to them, 
the Student Life office offers the 
Leadership Lunch series and 
Snapshots programs. Both are 
one-shot programs, as Hughes 
calls them, that do not delve as 
deep as the sustained programs.
The Leadership Lunch series, 
new this semester, offers a halfhour to an hour-long discussion of 
some leadership topic. Participants 
are given general knowledge about 
a topic, not a specific skill, accord
ing to Hughes. The program is of
fered twice this semester, with the 
next installment on November 18.
The Snapshots program is more 
of a conference-style series. Lasting 
a half-day on a weekend, the pro
gram is offered twice per semester 
and can be either skillor conceptbased, according to Hughes. The 
program offers a keynote address 
and multiple workshops in which 
students participate.
Attendance at one-shot pro
grams has varied, with as many 
as 50 participants at a Snapshot 
to 10 at a Leadership Lunch. Ac
cording to Hughes, hopes are that 
the Lunch program will reach 
what he considers a substantial 
attendance of about 20 students.
The Student Life office will also 
offer support for students wishing 
to participate in off-site programs 
located across the country.

makers. You have to be fast, you have to 
]mderstand people, you have to be nice,
: |ou have to flatter them ... you have to 
1 et them where you want them to go.
| But when you are the director of an 
inderfunded independent film, this bejomes a far more complicated issue. Its 
fyard to do that when you dont pay 
jieople, said DeSandire.
 Independent filmmakers are a rare 
breed: people who will dedicate them
selves to a proj ect completely for the love 
(jf it. They often have to find all the 
ihoney themselves, which, could mean 
tjhey pay out of their pocket. There is a 
light chance that their film will be dis
covered, but usually they make the film 
at no profit or even a loss.
; The road to producing a film starts 
with an idea. Not all ideas can make it 
into film. [You have to] figure out what 
youre goingto need, figure out is it going 
to be feasible, and how to make it fea
sible, said Lucas Hudak, a senior com
munications design major. Hudak is di
recting a short film, Franks Wild Life, 
which is based on a Tom Waits song, for 
filmmaking@cmu.
Once the idea is determined to be 
feasible, it is turned into a script. This 
is one of the most critical portions of 
the filmmaking process. Scripts are 
the foundation of the film. You can do 
anything if you have good writing, 
said DeSandire.
Whether the film is a short film or a 
feature-length film, they must be funded. 
This is the point where independent 
films diverge from studio films. Studio 
films have the big money backers, 
whereas the independent films are 
funded entirely by those people involved 
in. its creation, which often means-the 
director. Independent films are often 
funded by grants, private investors, or 
straight out of the directors pocket.
In making a feature film, everything 
is exponentially larger, said Brady 
Louis, of Pittsburgh Filmmakers. This 
is especially true of the costs. Some
times, to come in under budget, some 
filmmakers will try to get actors and
crew to work on their project without 
pay. If an actor has a lot of film experi
ence, then they are expecting to be paid, 
said Louis. But if you get an actor whos 
maybe only worked on stage, they might 
be more likely to do a film they arent 
sure about, just for the experience.
Equipment for independent films is 
usually rented or borrowed. The best 
resource for equipment in Pittsburgh is 
Filmmakers. For a nominal yearly mem
bership fee, Pittsburgh Filmmakers 
lends out their cameras, as well as giv
ing access to their editing facilities. Very 
few independent filmmakers do not uti
lize Pittsburgh Filmmakers resources 
for their projects.
Then comes the planning and shoot
ing of the film. Every day of shooting 
takes, several days of planning, said 
Louis. Everything needs to be set up 
beforehand: the camera shots, re
hearsal, organizing all the people in
volved, setting up the catering, getting 
costumes, renting equipment, etc. 
Sometimes, the planning takes longer 
than the shooting. We actually worked 
on [Crank] for a year before we shot it, 
said Sharon Dilworth, associate profes
sor of English and writer and 
producer on Crank.
But, as they say, the best laid 
plans often must change. I plan 
[the shots] out with 
storyboards and a shot list, 
said Hudak. But then when 
we get on the set and we take 
a look at whats actually hap
pening, weve got to rear
range the shot. This can 
cause further problems.
We wasted so much 
money redoing and re
doing and redoing, 
said Dilworth.
In independent 
films, absolute 
perfection is not 
the key. Youre  
not going to make a 
perfect feature film on 
$15,000, said Dilworth. The 
same goes for shorts. Every as
pect of the film cant be absolutely 
perfect for a small budget. In the end, 
though, what really matters is the very 
existence of the film, and the new ideas 
the filmmaker can bring across.

Directors exhibit novel cinematic story-telling skills
By WLADIMIR 
LABEIKO V SKY
Tartan Staffwriter
At some point in his career, 
Godard flatly renounced the 
rhythms of story-telling, broke 
the dictates of pace and decided 
to try and reinvent cinematic 
narrative. The result is a won
derful cinema of aphorisms where 
the threads are only alluded to, to
What: Forever Mozart 
Director: Jean-luc 
Godard 
Company: New Yorker 
Films
be assembled elsewhere. He says 
it best during Forever Mozart, 
This is what I like best about 
cinema, a saturation of grandiose-signs bathing in the absence 
of their explanation. Orson 
Welles said that movies are pieces
of time  Godard likes the pieces 
that venture outside of it.
Forever Mozart starts with one 
of the moments in filmmaking 
that belies its artifice the most 
casting. Aging director Victor 
Vitalis (ludic pun) has been hired 
by a Baron and a writer to direct 
the latters novel, Fatal Bolero. 
Soon after, were introduced to 
the centerpiece of the film Vitalis 
daughter (and Camus grand
daughter) together with his 
nephew plan on trekking to 
* Sarajevo to mount a Musset play 
in the middle of the war. It is a 
bizarre decision, a contradictory 
combination of both aggressive 
action and solipsism. But suicide 
is the ultimate freedom and the 
only interesting philosophical 
problem, so off they go.
Godards philosophizing actors 
. betray their aimlessness and ego
tism early on; they argue that 
their intention is to find a sense of 
freedom. It can be grating to see
adults act like literate teen-agers 
but their sadness suggests a 
strange and almost wise resigna
tion. As they find themselves 
smack in the middle of war, their 
determination doesnt seem that 
silly. Godard predictably shows
"The writer and producer 
[of Forever Mozart] do 
not apologize for their 
self importance. ___________
the front as a chaotic environ
ment of ego, children with toy 
guns clinging to authority. Life 
and war are the same for the sol
diers, one of them carries an auto
matic camera  the roll both 
containing pictures of her family 
and of corpses of their enemy.
When Godard returns to 
Vitalis, he has moved into a world 
equally horrible, a filmshoot. The
crew bark at each other much 
like the soldiers, scraping for au
thority. The writer and producer 
do not apologize for their self 
importance and when pressured 
to cut costs they recruit the home
less as actors .Fatal Bolero seems 
to be a bad art-film 
a pandering to 
pseudo intellectu
als but Vitalis is 
able to draw mo
ments of beauty 
shown in one of
-------:------ Godards most
wonderfully evoca
tive shots: Vitalis and his cin
ematographer filming the char
acters through a dirty window.
For ever Mozart alludes to an
other parallel. It is hinted that 
the Baron is backing the movie 
out of guilt. He is trying to re
deem himself to some extent by 
creating what he believes is art. 
Godards privileged suicidal ac
tors cannot bear to go on being
safe when the world is ripe with 
death. The play is not the thing, 
but it is all they know, and in 
reality it is all the shelter they 
need. Vitalis understands this but 
also its futility. As the Parisians 
flock to the canon of art them
selves also sheltered by it. Vitalis 
sees no better action than to lis
ten from outside to Mozart going 
from A to B, from B to C.

Director Billie August is a chief

At the beginning of Jerusalem 
August paints a telling political

City offers locally-based artists variety of resources
By-GREG MARCKS
Tartan Staffwriter
I was leafing through the latestr edition of Filmmaker, the 
Magazine of independent film, 
when I came across an article on 
alternative film venues. There, 
alongside theaters in New York 
and Los Angeles, was the Orgone 
Cinema, run by three Pittsburgh 
^dependent filmmakers who 
spruce up film screenings with 
raffles, snacks which rhyme with 
titles, and homemade posters. 
Two weekends ago, the mobile 
^rgone had a showing at the 
Silver Eye gallery, on East
Carson Street in the Southside, 
in which films were viewed not 
for content but for their amazing 
color photography.
The city of Pittsburgh really 
provides for its independent film
makers. Inspiring works of art 
can be viewed at its many eclec
tic theaters, including the Rex 
on the Southside, the Harris 
downtown, or the Melwood 
Screening Room in 0 akland. The 
latter two are run by Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers, a truly excellent re
source. In addition to running 
its two theaters, Filmmakers also 
serves as a filmmaking institu
tion and equipment house. Once
you have the technical knowl
edge to operate the equipment, 
membership rates are so low that 
it would actually cost more to 
rent equipment elsewhere for a 
single day than it would to have 
unlimited Filmmakers equip
ment access for an entire year. 
The new Filmmakers facility on 
Melwood Avenue also has a vari
ety of editing suites and a sound 
transfer facility for assistance in 
post-production.
A variety of small production 
companies operate in the local 
area. For those with bigger bud
gets, the Pittsburgh Film Office 
is a local facility dedicated to as
sisting larger-scale productions. 
Nearby in Trafford is Pinnacle 
Studios, a fully-equipped 
soundstage where scenes from 
Kingpin were filmed. Several 
other features, such as Batman, 
Desperate Measures, and the up
coming Superman, have chosen 
Pittsburgh as a location because 
of its picturesque exteriors. And 
many of you may remember that 
the made-for-cable movie The 
Assassination File was filmed 
right here on campus.
But these productions are 
studio-funded, whereas indie 
filmmakers have to raise their 
own finances. Many use per
sonal funds, some get grants, 
and others simply beg, borrow, 
or steal in true guerrilla filmmaking fashion.
But I have found that in Pitts
burgh, people are generally will
ing to help indies out. On the 
shoots I have worked on, local 
film officials such as police liasion 
Lt. Walter Oggier and weapons 
expert Wild Bill Laczko have 
gone above and beyond in assist
ing on independent productions.
New organizations are form
ing to irespond to a growth in 
interest in independent filmmak
ing. CMUs own film production 
club, filmmakingcmu, has
grown substantially in size in 
recent years. The Pittsburgh 
Film Colloquium, a recently es
tablished group of film scholars, 
filmmakers, and industry pro
fessionals, meets once a month 
at the University of Pittsburgh. 
And, of course, each year there is 
the Three Rivers Film Festival, 
showcasing local talent as well 
as outside submissions.
As an independent filmmaker,
I feel extremely fortunate to have 
attended college in a city which 
nurtures creative expression in 
film. With initiative, time, and 
funding, there is literally no limit 
to what Can be accomplished here. -

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  10 November 1997Guitarist gives Giant interview
By CHRIS CANNON
tartan Sports Editor .
' Friday afternoon, a stout security.man 
idth dreadlocks led me into the make
shift dressing room for the impending 
They Might Be Giants (TMBG) concert. 
There was plenty of food and one other 
ian in the room, but my eyes passed over 
fom as I scanned the place for, well, 
iants. He welcomed me to the food as I 
thought, Who are you and what have 
^ou done with ThemT 
1 The man had day-old stubble, squar
ish silver-frame glasses, and short 
Straight black hair. Thats when I no
ticed his black t-shirt, which pictured ai
quor bottle with a portrait of the late 
ndre the Giant on it.
! The band Lincoln was a perfect pre
amble to They Might Be Giants. Their 
uirky lyrics, high voices, and heavy 
litar jams had the crowd revved up for 
ijiore of the same. When TMBG finally 
(jame out, excitement was at a peak.
1 But before shooting shredded money 
(jut of a cannon, inspiring students to 
ijiake the floor of Rangos Hall bounce like 
a trampoline, and before playing a smat
tering of songs covering six albums, John 
Flansburgh of TMBG sat down for a chat.
John Flansburgh: So what are the big, 
hard-hitting questions?
The Tartan: Do you remember play
ing here four years ago [for Carnival]? 
i JF: Im trying to think, where did 
\ye play?
TT: How about when you came to 
Ijletropol last December?
\ JF: We do like 200 shows a year; I 
ifemember a lot of them.... I realize this 
domes across as the full-on stoned rock
guy going, Whu? I dont remember it, 
but you know most people dont remem
ber every day of their job. I remember 
the gigs where things break.
TT: How about the Milwaukee show 
where the stage collapsed?
JF: I remember the whole preamble of 
people jumping up on stage.... It was 
getting towards the end of the show nd 
it seemed oppressive that they werent 
letting people dance in the aisles.... So 
very cautiously, I said, Im sure the fire 
marshal wont mind if you get up and 
danced. Then all of a sudden people in 
the front of the crowd just jumped up on 
the stage.... I was just thinking This 
show is going to end really soon. Then, 
all of a sudden, there was this huge cloud 
of smoke, and as the smoke cleared, all 
the people were gone. I was like, Whoa, 
its like some kind of magic trick! Then I 
looked down, and I saw this crazy, like 
smashed-up jumbled pile of 10-foot long 
beams sticking at really precarious angles 
out of the floor. I looked out and it was 
just like Wow, what a drag.
TT: Why are there so many car crashes 
in the album John Henry?
JF: I didnt realize that there were. 
Weve written a lot of songs about trans
portation.... Were Americans, we drive 
around a lot. There are a lot of crazy 
people in our songs, there are a lot of 
murders in our songs, there are a lot of 
car crashes in our songs.
TT: Whats the coolest sound youve 
ever created?
JF: I immediately think of the guitar 
sound in Ana Ng.... Very early on in 
the era of using computers with musical 
instruments, before samplers really ex
isted.... We hooked up a computer that 
would open and close a noise gate which
would basically enforce these really hard, 
total silent rests between the phrases of 
the riff of the song.
TT: Do you find that you each sing the 
songs you write yourself?
JF: Weve both sung songs that the other 
person has been the primary instigator on.
I realize this more and more, you write to 
compliment your own strengths as a vocal
ist.... There are a couple of songs that 
[John] Linnell has written that I think my 
voice [fits better]. Theyre like Paul Simon 
songs that Art Garfunkel sings better.
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor
John Flansburgh, a member of TMBG, 
played in Rangos Hall on Friday night.
TT: How would you describe your music 
to the guy behind the desk in the hotel?
JF: We say its rock music. And theyre 
like, Oh. Sometimes, if thats not a good 
enough answer, well say, Its kind of like 
Beatle-based pop music with some kind 
of personal lyric, and that stops them.
Critic tests borders of mainstream films
The Critical Eye
When critics look back on the 1990s, 
they will doubtless characterize it as the 
decade of the independent film. The trend 
that started with occasional low-budget, 
artsy flicks like sex, lies and videotape 
has grown into a force that has chal
lenged our perceptions of Hollywood.
Indie flicks have moved from artsy 
to cool  its cool to see them, coqler to 
make them. They have divided movies 
into two factions: Hollywood movies 
and independent movies. In doing so, 
they have given critics and audiences 
license to be snobs, because the aver
age independent film is better than 
the average Hollywood film.
Which is not to say that there are no 
bad independent movies. Four Rooms 
and The Low Life are two of the less 
memorable ones. At the same time;, 
there are good Hollywood films, like 
Contact and Donnie Brasco. Holly-: 
wood wants to make quality movies, 
but quality is in the eye of the be
holder, and one of the reasons indie 
films are better than Hollywood films 
is that there are fewer people in
volved in an independent film, and, 
therefore, fewer opinions.
That is the only real difference be
tween anindependentmovie and a main
stream one. Independent is usually a 
label for anything produced by a studio 
other than the major Hollywood ones. 
But now that Disney owns Miramax 
and 20th Century Fox has launched 
what it calls its independent arm, Fox 
Searchlight, the indie/mainstream line, 
is becoming fuzzy. This, shows in the 
products; A major Hollywood film like 
Jerry Maguire feels like an indie flick 
because there is so much talking and so 
much emphasis on character. And 
Miramaxs The English Patient feels 
like a Hollywood film in its brash ro
manticism; war-tom lovers are the old
est story in the Hollywood Book of Plots.
Which begs the question: What is 
the future of independent film? Is it 
possible that the two factions are merg
ing? Probably not, but we might start 
to see more cases of filmmakers like 
Martin Scorsese who work through 
the Hollywood system but, because of 
their status, are riot controlled by it. 
Scorsese makes independent films in 
the philosophical sense of the word, 
but he manages to do it. via main
stream methods. The handful of film
makers who can walk the indie/main
stream line will, no doubt, grow in 
years to come. In the meantime, the 
indie scene is here to st&y.
AlexLewin is a senior creative!profes
sional writing major who is not ashamed 
to admit that he hated Jerry Maguire 
and loved The English Patient.

handled the statement in stride, 
though, and the. question and

from there.
Richter seemed easy to relate 
to throughout the program. He 
spoke in a diction that was very 
youthful; the way he told anec
dotes sounded exactly as if a teen
ager w;as telling them. He pre
sented himself without nervous
ness at all, and obviously very 
comfortable in front of a crowd. 
A self-described introvert with 
extrovert tendencies, that night 
Andy was unguarded and spoke 
his mind on any topic that came 
up. He was moderately funny, 
but it became evident that he 
works better in tandem when he 
doesnt have to run the show by 
himself. On the Conan OBrien 
Show, Andy is well-known for 
his occasional interjections 
rather than as a source of con
stant humor.
Richter played many video clips 
of himself on TV shows from his 
past and present. Many of these 
clips were funny, in particular 
the music video spoofs he made, 
featuring himself on vocals as 
well as playing every character 
in the video. It was unfortunate 
that the audience had to sit on 
the floor (perhaps the least com
fortable place to sit for any 
amount oftime) because it seemed 
to me that the program started to 
feel longer than it was. At the 
conclusion of the show, after the 
jokes passed about how they 
should have held the program in 
the Connan Room on the floor 
below, the students filed into the 
hallway. The speech was inter
esting, I thought, mainly because 
never had I seen an actor speak 
before. Now, when I watch the 
Conan OBrien Show, I can say 
Ive seen Andy, and with some 
degree of confidence, I can say I

nCd njtDwR Campaign Finance Reform and the Future of American Democracy
Erik A. Devereux is senior lecturer in politics at the H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy 
and Management and director of the Master of Science in Public Policy and Management 
Program. His research interests are media politics, elections, and public policy. He is 
particularly interested in the ways in which the media and campaign financing affect the 
American political process. Devereux frequently appears on radio and television programs 
devoted to politics, has published many essays on national and local politics in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, and has been quoted in a wide variety of media on current political topics. He 
writes:
This talk inevitably will lead into some fundamental issues of democratic theory that raise disturbing 
questions about how the public can influence the actions of the government.
Two books will be at center stage. The first is Thomas Ferguson, Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of 
Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago 
Press, 1995). This is one of the most important books on campaign finance issues, and one that demonstrates 
how much of the current debate is missing the point.
The second is Dan Clawson, Alan Neustadtl and Denise Scott, Money Talks: Corporate PA Cs and Political 
Influence (New York, NY: Basic Books, 1992). This book delves into the specific mechanisms that 
organized interests use in the U.S. to shape legislation. It directly confronts a rather voluminous literature 
in political science that claims interest group spending in politics does not have tangible impacts on the 
policy process.
These two books about campaign finance reform illuminate the influence of organized interests in U.S. 
politics. They also raise important questions about the theory and practice of politics in America.

Film examines seventies suburbia
By ALEXLEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The Ice Storm is a film that 
speaks its own language. It is 
heavy on the visual and light on 
the dialogue. It imbues simple 
situations, like a family dinner, 
with unstated emotional turmoil. 
Where we expect loud confronta
tion, there is silent disdain.
What: The Ice Storm 
' Director: Ang Lee 
I Company: Fox Search
light
The film explores the dynamics 
of two New Canaan, Connecticut 
families on Thanksgiving of1973, 
when a furious ice storm hits. 
Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is having 
an affair with his neighbor, the 
aloof Janey Carver (Sigourney 
Weaver). Bens wife, Elena (Joan 
Allen) doesnt know how to feel 
about her husbands infidelity, 
except to contemplate commit
ting the same act. Meanwhile, 
the Hoods daughter, Wendy 
(Christina Ricci) is experiment
ing sexually with the Carver boys, 
Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy 
(Adam Hann-Byrd).
The actors are truly superb, 
particularly Weaver, whose por
trayal of an unhappy woman who 
doesnt know how to be a mother 
is subtle and stirring. When she 
catches Wendy and Sandy liter
ally with their pants 
down, she tells Wendy,
A persons body is their 
temple. But we know 
Janey doesnt believe 
what shes sayingshes 
saying what she thinks a 
mother ought to say, and 
her'point is lost on Wendy 
(who is, of course, not 
her daughter).

to create you, and try as you might 
to escape those confines, you are 
always a part of the family unit 
your family is who you are.
But The Ice Storm never 
reaches the level of 
such great family 
drama as, say, Ordi
nary People because 
it is so wrapped up in 
its own profundity; it 
takes itself so seri
ously. While the char
acters are fascinating 
and the situations 
dramatic, one cannot 
help but wonder; 
what are these people 
so upset about?
The power of the 
story, though, lies in 
its incidents of mis^ 
communication. The adults speak

keys is the man they go home 
with. But while the adults are 
engaging in all this contrived 
custom, the children are taking 
a simpler approach; Can I sleep 
in your bed with you? Wendy 
asks Sandy.
The screenplay, by James 
Schamus, closely follows Rick
Paul (the remarkably talented 
Tobey Maguire). In the film, he 
interjects oddly philosophical com
ments here and there, the most 
interesting being the bit of narra
tion which opens the movie (and 
closes the book), in which Paul 
compares the idea of family to the 
Fantastic Four (hes a comic book 
nut). His point is that your family
and when the adults try to reach 
out to the kids, they invariably 
screw it up. The Kevin Kline char-* 
acter, for instance, attempts to give 
his son Paul a lesson about the 
facts of life, but all he can manage 
to say is that Paul shouldnt mas^ 
turbate in the shower because it 
wastes water. Pauls response? 
Dad, Fm sixteen.Album piques interest for CMU concert
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The common view of the European music 
industry is that all the really compelling rock 
and roll originates from Britain, while other 
countries produce fast-food pop and dance 
tunes. However, these assumptions overlook 
the work of German rockers The Notwist, 
who are set to play a November 11 concert at 
CMU. Their latest album, 12, a blend of 
Sonic Youth-style noise with modem sounds 
and song structures, can only build anticipa
tion for their show.
I Who: The Notwist 
What: 12
Company: Zero Hour
Markus Acher, Micha Acher, and Martin 
Messerschild rip through nine well-balanced 
tracks on 12, as well as five remixes on Loup. 
The album is best understood when listened 
to chronologically. On the first track, Tor
ture Day, Marku Acher uses relentless riffs 
and mournful vocals to create a hypnotic 
sound. Then the band breaks out the noise, 
in thrashers like My Phrasebook, and M. 
Many of these songs seem to be out of order,
such as My Phrasebook, and M, but each 
element contributes to the loud, atmospheric 
sound. The record then shifts between mel
lowness and darkness. Slow, anxiety-filled

The Notwist will be playing special blend of noise and 
music in McComomy Auditorium November 11.
song, contrasts the pop sound identified with'- 
Palmers version and the noise-rock of The' 
Notwist, creating a satisfying mix.
The String, located near the end of 12,! 
contains everything that defines the! 
band and is perhaps the strongest 
track on the album. It starts with a! 
chord pattern that propels most ofthe melody and is separated by astrong, disorganized interlude. Thesong ends in a blast of noise that 
should really make the listenerthink. In additon, the song is aidedby Markus Achers vocals, which al
ways add another dimension to theband. His lyrics often add a fearfulquality to the songs, enhancing their 
impact. In addition, his melancholy 
voice often sounds like an additonal 
instrument, adding more depth to 
The Notwist.
The Notwist have been labeled as 
both progressive and modern rock, often in
dicating an album that is difficult to listen to. 
However, The Notwist has created an album 
that at times seems obnoxious and random,
tunes such as Noah and 12 are inter
rupted by alt-metal songs like Instr.
The EP Loup adds little in addition to 12, 
but is nevertheless a decent effort. Remixes
of Noah and The String retain many of but always manages to achieve coherence, 
their original qualities. However, Johnny Perhaps when they come to CMU, students 
and Mary, a remake of a Robert Palmer can find out what they are all about.
Festival joins lauded films with local works
FESTIVAL, from page Lll
is time to leave for the mothership. 
The converts are off to Jerusalem 
convinced that Armageddon is 
near. This break from the town is 
one of the most interesting the
ses of the film, suggesting a mu
tual dependence between secular 
community and spirituality.
It is not clear whether family 
ties are stronger than faiths.
The towns patriarch-to-be, a mix  
between Forrest Gump and Clint 
Eastwood, is absently trying to 
rebuild his town, or rather claim 
what is thought to be rightfully 
his, the role of leader. This some
times whimsical mingling of 
Arthurian and Biblical legend is 
also very telling of how ideolo
gies are built solely on the basis 
of stories.In the end the cult (or
is it religion?) betrays the con
verts. The unbalance is surpris
ing how disturbing it is to watch 
the villagers lose their faith. 
Augusts last scene is remark
able in the understatement and 
in how it finds the core of the 
religious problem. In some ways, 
Jerusalem is a political film, 
sweetly wrapped in a family saga 
and a love story. It is a timely
film and it is a shame that it is in ; 
such a limited release.
Jerusalem and Forever Mozart \ 
are part of the Three Rivers Film \ 
Festival, which runs until Novem\ 
ber20. Films will be held each day \ 
at six area theaters: The Byham, J
