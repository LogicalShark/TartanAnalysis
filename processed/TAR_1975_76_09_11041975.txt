Architects Meet to Present Demands
by Charles Mitch
Complaining of deficiencies in the 
Department of Architecture and interfer - 
ence by the administration in Warner Hall, 
over two hundred architecture students 
assembled on Sunday, November 2, to dis
cuss their greivances. Over 130 of the de
partments 300 students signed a petition 
declaring that the students are opposed to 
precipitous actions by the universities adDorina Spelman
ministration to alter the structure or 
composition of the Department of Arch
itecture. Immediately after this first meet
ing aproximately 100 students met with 12 
faculty members to discuss the situation.
Fifteen seniors from the department 
met on October 30 with President Cyert, 
Akram Midani , Dean of CFA and Edward 
Schatz, Povost of CFA. The students pre
sented the following problems as represen
tative of the viewpoint of the students: 1) 
lack of organization in the departmenal ad
ministration, 2) absence of direction in the 
administration of the department, 3) lack 
of cooperation or communication among 
the administrations of the university, the 
department, the faculty, and the students,
4) an ingrown faculty, with about nine of 
twenty-five members graduates of this de
partment, 5) the loss of three of the nine 
members of the design faculty last year

It is clear we can never be better than 
the established Ivy League schools in the 
humanities, President Cyert commented 
last week, adding that he didnt like being 
in a position of being second or third best 
in anything.
The statement was made during an 
hour long interview between Dr. Cyert and 
student leaders, broadcast on WRCT.
In discussing the humanities program 
at CMU, Dr. Cyert went on to say that we 
must look for those areas where we have 
strengths, such as the technical writing or 
applied history programs. We must find 
unique thrusts where we can do a super job 
in the departments of English, History, and 
Modern Languages or rethink the whole 
issue. When asked about a recent editorial 
in the TARTAN calling for discontinuing 
the granting of degrees in the humanities, 
Dr. Cyert commented that the editorial 
was saying the right things.
Later in the interview, Dr. Cyert was 
asked about difficulties the TARTAN had 
encountered in attempting to obtain the 
agenda of the recent meeting of the Board 
of Trustees. He sta.ted that there was 
nothing secretive taking place at the board 
meetings and added that he saw no reas
on why meetings couldnt be open to a re
porter.
Similarly, Dr. Cyert was asked about 
the refusal of the Athletic Director, James 
Banner, to provide the TARTAN with this 
years budget for the department. He re
sponded by saying that he would prefer 
to have specific questions asked, adding 
that he thinks Jim Banner will be open 
about it. He went on to say that he would 
try to make it [the budget) accessible in 
terms of total amounts.
In response to questions involving 
opening up the tenure process, Dr. Cyert 
commented that he would like to see either 
each department or college post a list of 
people up for consideration, adding that a 
list of the final decisions could be given to 
the TARTAN and the FOCUS for publica
tion.
One caller to the show asked about 
statistics indicating that the quality of stu
dents at CMU has been dropping. Dr. Cyert 
commented that statistics on the quality of 
the student body suchas predictive grade 
averages should be made available for pub
lication.
Another caller asked about rumors 
that a mandatory food service plan would 
be imposed next year for dorm residents. 
The President responded by saying that the 
matter had not been discussed with him, 
adding that for the university as a whole , 
there is definitely no such proposal. 
In answer to another callers question 
about low voter turn out for Student Sen
ate elections, Dr. Cyert agreed with a com
ment made by Doug Konopka, President of 
Student Government, that if the activities 
fee were increased to $75, maybe more pe
ople would vote in order to protect their 
pocket books.
and the eminant loss of more this year: the 
turnover of one-half to two-thirds of this 
most important part of the faculty is indic
ative of the inability of the department to 
retain experianced and qualified personel, 
6) the low quality of the facilities and the 
scattering of these facilities, especially the 
studio space, impeeds the educational pro
cess amd prevents the interaction between 
students necessary to an architectural edu
cation, 7) the overcrowding of the fresman class without proportional increase in 
facilities, budget, or faculty, is affecting 
the ability of the department to provide 
quality educationto that class now, and 
throughout the department in years to 
come, 8) the low level of salaries paid to 
faculty in the department prevents the de
partment from acquiring and retaining 
.-highly qualified faculty. 9) the desire of 
the university administration to gain con
trol of the department by installing the 
department head of their choice, and to 
transform the undergraduate program into 
one patterned after the Advanced Building 
Studies graduate program, at the expense 
of a strong education in Design and History 
of Architecture.
Acting as leaders for the students, who 
identify themselves as the Associated Stu
dents of Architecture (ASA), were Fred 
Schuster and Robert Skydell. They dis
claimed any responsibility for leadership, 
stating that they were running the meeting 
only because we happened to have a 
typewriter  for preparing the petition and 
the other documents which were distribut
ed to the students.
In the summary of the meeting beContinued on page eightNeeds Determined
by Stephen Warren
Ms. Rita Cohen, who was recently ap
pointed Assistant to the General Manager 
of Campus Services for Food Service Plan
ning, remarked that the program is now 
trying to determine the needs of the cam
pus, so that effective changes can be made.
For instance, she suggested that the Tar
tan Grill, a big, open room, might be re
modeled to convey a different atmosphere. 
Would students prefer a waitressed restau
rant where they could bring dates? Might 
not the Grill feature forms of entertain
ment, sponsored perhaps by the Activi
ties Board? All of these are ideas of 
Ms. Cohen.
Ms. Cohen and the Food Committee 
are investigating more interesting menu 
selections, probing for dietary alterna
tives. The immediate evaluation should be
completed by Christmas; student input 
will surely influence Food Services fu
ture.
General Manager Zalewski comments, 
though, that this is only the planning stage 
that major changes will not show until 
next fall.
Coupon meals and a renovated Skibo 
may become Food Service realities in Fall
1976.
Mr. Steve Zalewski, General Manager of 
Campus Services, and the Food Committee 
are now evaluating various plans that might 
best satisfy students. These considerations 
affect menu selection as well as dining en
vironment .
A coupon option could be available as 
early as the spring semester: rather than

On Sunday, Nov. 2, the Activities Board 
Executive Board elected Dorina Spelman, 
formerly the Coffeehouse Head, as the new 
Chairperson.
Dorina feels that the former chairperson 
Patty Aerni has finally stabilized the

Henderson Residents requested to be locked up.
Dorm Lockup
by Debbie Rosenkrantz
Following the almost unanimous re
quest of Henderson residents, Henderson 
Hall has been locked from the hours of 
midnight to 6 a.m. seven days a week. 
The residents circulated a petition and 
submitted it to Student Dorm Council 
for approval and support. With the 
backing of SDC and the approval of the 
administration, the procedure was put into 
effect three weeks ago.
SDC has come up with some guide
lines that are subject to approval from the 
housing office. They are: 1) A dorm can 
request to be locked from midnight to 6
a.m., 2) 85% of the residents must request 
the locking, 3) The policy for each dorm 
will be reviewed each September, 4) Lock
ing time for all dorms will be standardized.
If the fourth guideline were to be 
adopted, this would mean that Woodlawn 
appartments which are presently locked 
from 12 a.m. to 7 a.m. and Morewood 
Gardens which is presently locked from 
1 a.m. to 8 a.m. would adopt the standard 
times. This would make it easier for 
security to help enforce. SDC is not 
pressuring any dorm to lock itself, says 
SDC president Bill Jacobs, we just want 
everyone to know that we will support 
them if they want it. There has been only 
one incident of someone propping the door 
open during the locked hours, according to 
Jacobs. Each resident has a key. Guests 
are asked to call ahead to inform the 
person they are visiting that they are 
coming so they can open the door.
suggestions for new forms of entertain
ment. As AB is now beginning to plan its 
programs for next semester, Dorin^ hopes 
that students would contact them soon 
concerning what they would like to have 
on campus after the Christmas holidays.
Internally, AB will strive under its new 
chairperson for greater cooperation among 
the committees - each of which will hope
fully not compete with the other but 
rather interwork for better scheduling 
and more popular forms of entertainment. 
Dorina wishes for the committees to grow 
in size and become more representative of

Whv didn't we think of this before?
A CIRCLE GAME
The year is 1984 and a Student Committee is meeting 
with the CMU Business Manager. The students have just sub
mitted a proposal concerning what should be done to Carne
gie -Mellon in order to make it a more pleasant and function
al environment.
The students suggested that the lower level of Skibo be 
reconstructed so as to be more functional. They suggested 
that it would be much more efficient if the Art Store and the 
Bookstore were combined, eliminating the need for two sup
port staffs, and it was thus recommended that the Art Store 
be moved to Baker Hall. It was also noted that the Design 
Department studios were located in Baker, resulting in the 
new location being more convenient for them.
The students further suggested that the area currently oc
cupied by the Art Store and Meeting Rooms 1i, 12 and 13 
be converted into a new location for the Bureau of Place
ments. It was noted that Placements could then use the re
maining meeting rooms for interviews, 'making use of the 
rooms during the day when they are not in heavy demand by 
students.
To compensate for these converted rooms, the students 
suggested that the rooms currently used for student offices 
be converted into rooms twice as large by .knocking down 
eyery-other wall. The students noted a structural engineers 
report which stated that the walls in question could be easily 
removed since they were only plasterboard. "It seems, 
stated the report, that these walls are superflous to the gen
eral structure of the building and are in no way necessary. 
The students also suggested that a lounge area be con
structed somewhere in the middle of the long hallway which 
currently services the student offices. They believed that 
there was a need for an open area in which to place a coke 
machine. The structural report stated that "similarly, there 
is a wall along the lain corridor. . . which is made of a simi
lar plasterboard material and thus easily removed. 
Another recent student proposal calls for the separation 
of the United Fraternal Organization into two independent 
groups: one for the fraternities and one for the sororities. 
It was pointed out that the two groups have very few com
mon concerns and that there was no need for the joint 
venture. The current President of UFO commented that he 
agreed and didnt understand why no one had thought of 
the idea earlier.
A TART A Si reporter contacted the President of the 
Student Dormitory Council and asked him if SDC should be 
similarly divided into male and female independent units. 
The SDC President informed the TARTAN that SDC was in 
the process of opening their Donner Hall Darkroom and invi
ted him to do a story on it.
Finally, still another student committee recommended 
that instead of switching to a different registration procedure 
each semester, the University should adopt one in which 
each department set up a table in the gymnasium so that each 
student could travel from line to line, adding and dropping 
courses as necessary. This system would eliminate the need 
for the student having to run all around campus just to make 
a few simple changes to his schedule.
The committee further recommended that instead of 
using the cumbersome 3-D form, the university switch to 
individual computer cards with each card containing certain 
relevant data. It was argued by the student group that instead 
of the three month lag time needed to process the 3-D forms, 
the computer cards method would only take a few weeks.
A11 three student proposals were submitted to the Board 
of Trustees for consideration but were temporarily tabled 
due to the fact that the Board is currently entrenched in 
work, deciding whether the name of the University should be 
changed to Carnegie Institute of Technology, a name some 
members of the Board feel is more indicative of the schools 
actual orientation.

The Plato Experiment 
Editor:
This letter is in response to 
the letter in the TARTAN of 
October 28, 1975 concerning 
the inaccessibility of the Plato 
system.
While I sympathize with the 
letter writer and anyone else 
who has been unable to use 
Plato as they desired, the writer 
has simply reached wrong con
clusions based on numerous mis
conceptions which should be 
cleared up.
1. Plato was never intended 
to be a free and unconstrained 
service. We simply do not have 
sufficient facilities to offer such 
a service. First, there are only 4 
terminals on campus. Second, 
the present memory allocation 
(in Urbana) for each Plato ter
minal on the system is not suf
ficient to allow general self pac
ed instruction. This has been 
stated by CERL in its reports 
to the NSF and is evident both 
from comparisons of average 
lesson size versus average core 
allocation and from recent sys
tem hang-ups.
The terminals are here for an 
experiment in their utility. It 
is only by use in courses that we 
will gather information which 
may convince the University
that Plato is worthwhile, for us, 
on a larger scale. The terminals 
are or will be in use in projects 
in many departments of the 
University. As the scheduled us
age increases, we expect most 
idle time to disappear. So long as 
there is time available, I wel
come inquiries for any sort of 
supervised use.
2. It simply is not true that 
no one can use it! Over 200 
students currently have signons for Plato at CMU. That num
ber is increasing steadily. Based 
on average weekly usage rates 
per student obtained from Ur
bana, heavy usage by 150 stu
dents would saturate all the terminal-hours available during 
non-maintenance times. Termin
als are often available because 
people sometimes share the fa
cility with the maintenance peo
ple and because not all those 
students who are signed up use 
their full allotment. (I might 
point out that at Urbana, the 
physics department alone has 30 
terminals which are essentially 
available only on a scheduled, 
course-associated basis.)
3. The abuses of the system 
were neither fleeting nor trivial. 
Over a period of many weeks, a 
small group of Plato freaks 
attempted to monopolize and in
capacitate the system. A multi
hour password-stealing session
was not unusual. They wrote 
letters to other sites to obtain 
illegal sign-ons. They would lock 
the door to other students. They 
would refuse to relinquish ter
minals to legitimate users. They 
attempted to tamper with course 
records both here and else
where. They attempted to crash 
the system. This was done de
spite hours spent trying to reason-cajole-threaten them out of 
it. As they were told, the ulti
mate result has been to reserve 
use of the system to course 
users enforced by system blocks 
at Urbana. I have attempted to 
create sign-ons for non-prime 
usage, but that has been abused. 
(There simply is no system facile 
ity to declare that certain signons can be used only a certain 
times.)
4. Finally, I must say that I 
made the decision to limit sys
tem use very reluctantly and 
only a) after many attempts to 
solve the problem in a more lim
ited fashion; b) after complaints 
by students unable to do course 
work; c) at the insistence of the 
course instructors who found 
their students unable to get on; 
and d) after consulting with 
numerous colleagues irvolved in 
the Plato project.
I, too, hate to see any avail
able facility going even partially

made for educational reasons only.

Stingy Student Senate
Editor
^ To anyone who has attended 
Student Senate meetings this 
semester, it would appear as if 
Senate has already over alloca
ted its funds for the year. Sen
ates constant stand against im
proving those things that the stu
dents at this university really 
want is, in my opinion, as stupid 
m and unreasonable as most of 
Senate members Lets face it - we 
give money to every group on 
campus from the Saturday 
Walk through Schenley Park 
Club (which has three members 
and we buy their shoestrings) to 
the CMU Marshmallow Roas
ter for whom we buy the mat> ches. However, when we talk 
about those activities in which 
many students actively parti
cipate, we start cutting throats. 
One case in point is Buggy, 
where the Fianance committee 
again and again makes cuts in 
the budget, reduces the freerolls, and, in general, enjoys 
p pulling the wheels off buggy. 
Another sad situation concerns 
the Student Senates refusal to 
do anything to improve the ten
nis courts. Although I do not 
play tennis, and dont really give 
a damn if we make it a sandbox 
for the administrators to play in, 
I do feel the idea of bettering 
^ the courts is a worthwhile pro
ject. A large part of the student 
body does play tennis, many 
quite avidly, and Senate does 
represent the student body (at 
least in theory). Yet another 
example is the Carnegie Tech
nical - a truly fine publication 
that CMU should be proud to 
publish. This year the Tech
nical was gunned-down in mid
flight by Student Senate. Come 
on Senate - get your asses in 
gear and support the worthwhile 
activities of this campus instead 
ot killing them.
These cases in themselves do 
not sound overly terrible until 
you realize that Senate still has 
approximately $8,000 for 
which it has no immediate plans. 
The Finance Committee claims 
it is waiting for a worthy activi
ty. After seeing the activities 
that are being cut or reduced, I 
am curious as to just what the 
hell they feel a worthy activi
ty exactly is. The only plan for 
the moment is to save the mon
ey until they feel they are justi
fied in handing it out. Sounds 
like its time to start checking 
for secret bank accounts.
I somehow feel that the stu
dents will, and rightfully should, 
show anger and disgust with the
I
present Student Senate.
Daniel Capouellez
Senator - CiT
Under Representative Senate 
Editor:
I just read the front page 
story in todays (October 28) 
TARTAN regarding Student 
Senate elections. When 1 finished 
it my mind read???. I simply 
find the decision made by Sen
ate to be absurd and to me, un
acceptable.
As I interpret the article, 
Student Senate feels that people 
who have less than five votes 
cast for them, or less than 1% 
of their constituency, can be 
responsible student leaders. But 
what kind of leader is this that 
we are talking about? It is not a 
leader of a small special interest 
group. It is the role of Student 
Senator that we are talking 
about, supposedly a person rep
resenting the needs and wishes 
of the students of his/her con
stituency here at CMU to Stu
dent Senate - the body charged 
with the representation of the 
wishes and needs of the students 
to the University, and also the 
body responsible for the use of 
funds every student pays as his/ 
her Student Activity Fee. Does 
Senate seriously believe that a 
person who carries less than 1% 
ot his/her constituency can do 
this? I know that I dont want 
someone who is not definitely 
representing the students of his/ 
her constituency deciding what 
happens to $25.00 of my mon
ey.
Although I myself am a can
didate for Student Senate, and it 
would hurt my chances of being 
elected, I strongly urge that 
Student Senate reconsider the 
matter of Senate elections. I 
hope that elections can be 
changed from a farce to viable 
selection process so that stu
dents can have fair representa
tion and leadership.

I would like to respond to a 
statement in the Food Service 
article of the October 28 Tartan 
in which it was stated that I agree with Ms. Cohen that stu
dents are generally satisfied with 
Food Service and are not so firm 
in their desire for a seconds line 
at the Skibo cafeteria. This 
statement is a complete fabrica
tion. I in tct, I have requested 
that the SDC Food Service com
mittee, in conjunction with 
f ood Service, publish a survey 
to find out this particular infor
mation.
I fail to understand how the 
Tartan can know my opinions 
on this particular topic when no 
Tartan reporter has ever con
tacted me to discuss it. I hope, 
that in the future, the Tartan 
will be a little more careful in 
what it prints and will be cer-.
tain that what they do print is

Last week Mr. Willie Roy 
Thompson submitted a letter to 
comment on my last column, 
BUGGY COMMENTS. 1 would 
like to take this opportunity to 
respond to some of Mr. Willie 
Roy Thompsons allegations and 
misconceptions.
Mr. Willie Roy Thomp
son seemed rather distressed that 
my column does not bear my 
full name, only my initials. I 
would like to know if it would 
really make any difference if he 
knew my full name. If it did, 
Im sure that with the proper 
motivation, Mr. Willie Roy 
Thompson or anyone else on 
this campus, could, with a few 
discrete inquiries, discover my 
identity. For now though, it is 
known to my editors, and that 
is all that is required. Let me 
also make it clear that my col
umn is an opinion column. It 
expresses my personal opinions 
on various subjects, based on the 
facts as I believe them to be. It 
in no way reflects the opinions 
or viewpoints, either personal or 
official, of the Sweepstakes 
Chairperson, the individual 
buggy chair people, or anyone 
else associated with Sweep
stakes.
Mr. Willie Roy Thomp
son went to great lengths to 
proclaim the ability and right of 
the Student Government Fi
nance Committee to require 
fees and specify income. To 
illustrate his point he cited 
several examples of how the 
Finance Committee has raised 
the fees of W3VC radio club, 
Spring Carnival Midway, Cheer
leaders, Gaming and Simulations 
Club, and Karate Club. He also 
stated that the Tartan, U.F.O.,
S.D.C., and A.B. were required 
to increase their income con
tributions to the programs which 
Senate has funded.
Since Mr. Willie Roy 
Thompson is a member of the 
Finance Committee it would be 
logical to assume that his facts 
are correct. This, however, may 
not be the case. According to 
the official uWM.hlS for leh past 
two academic years as published 
by Student Government, the 
Radio Club has not changed its 
fees at all and its allocations 
from Senate has risen by 13 per
cent. The Cheerleaders budget

the allocation from Student 
Government, so it doesnt apcontinued on page five
View from Warner Hall
Each student  some with ease and others with difficulty 
 experienced Enrollment Day on Monday, September 2,
1975. The next Enrollment Day is scheduled for Monday, 
January 5, 1976. Since September, several debriefing 
meetings have been held with faculty, academic department 
personnel, administrative personnel, and students. The 
problems which caused difficulty on the September Enrol
lment Day are now well known to those people responsible. 
Several of these problems occur only in the first-semester: 
production of ID cards, special departmental and college 
meeting for new students, processing of Personnel Action 
Notices for graduate students, and pending bank loans. While 
there has been much thought and several proposed solutions, 
we will have to wait until next fall to assess our performance 
in solving these problems.
In spite of the September problems, it is estimated that in 
excess of 60% of the undergraduates encountered no diffi
culty in the fall enrollment process. We would hope to do 
much better this January. Several September problems will 
be corrected for January. The cashiers office will send out 
invoices to include full tuition charges, activity fee and hous
ing and food service charges well in advance of the due date 
for fee settlement. This will prevent the hurry up phone 
call to mom and dad for more money in order to settle your 
student account. The collection of enrollment data will be 
improved so as to produce more accurate class lists in a 
shorter period of time. Refinements of the add/drop proce
dure are also planned.
The first step in a successful Enrollment procedure is to 
have a successful Registration period. I have talked with 
many students about demand scheduling or interactive sche
duling and I firmly believe that such aprocedure can improve 
the scheduling process by better matching of student requests 
for courses and departmental offerings. Such a procedure will 
hopefully be ready for a test run in the spring semester of 
1976-77.
The Registration plans for this fall will be similar to those 
used last spring. During Registration, students have time to 
review the academic schedule, consult with their faculty advi
sor and make enrollment plans. The delay of course selction 
until Enrollment Day may mean desired courses selections 
are closed, faculty advisors are not available for consul
tation, or an adjustment to the invoice is necessary. 
Add/drops on Enrollment Day are to be expected, but they 
should be reserved for changes to an already-existing aca
demic schedule, not for the intial creation of an academic 
schedule.
The Registration and Enrollment procedure is designed to 
provide the student with a systematic procedure which allows 
sufficient time to make academic and financial plans. Such a 
procedure requires the flow of information between students, 
faculty, academic departments, registrar and cashier. The 
timetable for second semester Restration and Enrollment is:

dules or other information through the U.S. mail or campus 
mail. The U.S. mail is prohibitive because of cost, time de
lay and in many cases, the lack of valid addresses. Campus 
mail, while being very useful, also has the drawback of not 
having an address for every student. Distribution of informa
tion is not easy. Several suggestions have been proposed, but 
the strongest has been the creation of a set of student mail 
boxes in Skibo or some other central location, where every 
student could receive campus correspondence. Such a facility 
would prevent the necessity of informing the registrar every 
time you move (which you dont do now) and insure that 
important information would reach you. What do you 
think? Stop by and chat or drop me a note.

STEAM TUNNELS 
OF LIMITS
Steam tunnels under the CMU campus 
have been locked since last Friday. This 
action .was taken as safety measure after 
work installing safety valves and air vents 
was completed. Locking had been planned, 
but the certainty of the need was rein
forced last week when some student 
tampered with the progress of the work. 
According to Dean Swank, this student was 
risking his life. The tunnels carry steam at 
extremely high pressure and temperature. 
The incident was reported by the contract
or. In the past, the tunnels have been used 
as unauthorized access to buildings. Any 
one caught in the tunnels is subject to 
disciplinary action.

One recent act in the steam tunnel; could have cost 
the lives of its perpetrators.
THISTLE ANTICIPATES GOOD YEAR
By Stephen Warren
Because of an increase in student intetest and improved marketing strategies, 
Editor-in-Chief Kevin Scott expects sales of 
Thistle 76 to exceed last years edition.
Nearly 600 yearbooks might be sold 
during the once only campaign in Baker 
Hall: Nov. 11-14, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. This
would mark another sales increase since the 
annuals rebirth in 1974.
Seniors buy about half the books, so 
they are being coaxed with a special price: 
$9 instead of the usual S10. For a small 
fee, senior pictures will be taken. A ticket 
will be given to each purchasing; this of
fers him a chance to win some prize in a 
drawing.
Partially funded by student government, 
the yearbook may eventually be supported 
solely by advertising and sales. Despite in
flation, its publisher still offers competative rates. Andrew Funk, business man
ager, noted: Prices are better, but our
yearbook retains its quality.
The Thistle in order to make students 
aware that a yearbook exists, has publi
cized through posters, WRCT and The Tar
tan. Campus organizations and individuals 
are encouraged to suggest how theywant 
Carnegie-Mellon portrayed; student input 
is the best representative of school life, 
Editor Scott explained.

DR. FIX APPLIES MATH
by Thomas Kendig
As of the Fall semester, the CMU math 
department has been operating under a 
new head, Dr. George Fix. The new head 
has brought with him a new degree, Ap
plied Mathmatics.
Dr. Fix was asked to come to CMU last 
fall from the University of Michigan where 
he was working as an Associate Professor, 
He was asked to head the Math department 
and formulate a new program for an ap
plied math degree. I think this is a most 
fantastic thing, said Fix. The new pro
gram is meant to train people and give 
them a workable repertoire in the areas of 
1) numerical methods, 2) operations re
search and 3) probablity and statistics. All 
of these will be heavily computer oriented. 
The new option will hopefully produce 
better, more industrially oriented problem 
solvers. This is very much in tune with 
Dr. Cyerts new concept of the direction 
the University should take.
We are going to emphasize applied 
mathmatics, Dr. Fix reports. Dr. Fix 
does not feel this will hurt the other 
branches of math at this university because 
the same, very top notch people we have 
here will be staying and continuing their 
research as before. The department has an 
internationally recognized effort in the 
area of continuum mechanics and in addi
tion it is hoped that it will open up into 
the new area of numerical analysis and 
optimization. This means the department
is offering new courses in such areas as data 
analysis, computing, and operations re
search. There is a possibility of additions to 
the faculty, which has been shrinking over 
the last few years. Dr. Fix feels Applied 
Mathematics is a subject whose time has 
come, the computer is mostly responsible 
for this whole new era in mathematics. At 
present there are only two other universi
ties who offer programs that are similar to 
the CMU applied math program, MIT and 
Rensselaer. Dr. Fix commented our pro
gram will be better because we work 
harder than they do. CMU is also offering
a Masters program in applied math. 
Another extension of the department facil
ities is the making of an educational Film 
on applied math.
Dr. Fix received his PhD from Harvard 
in 1968 and was working at the University, 
of Michigan on some interesting research 
projects which he is continuing at CMU. 
The one principal and most controversial 
interest at present, has to do with the 
amount of freon in the upper atmosphere. 
Using the idea of predictive modeling 
and mathematical finite element tech
niques as well as computers, Dr. Fix has 
come up with preliminary results on a 
highly simplified model which indicates 
that fluorocarbons can have deteriorating 
effects on the upper atmosphere (i.e. 
80 Km). However the time scales over 
when this occurs appear to be on the 
order of 20 to 30 years. Dr. Fix hopes 
now to go back and retry the analysis

using a more accurate model.
He has also completed a preliminary 
study on the Gulf stream current. He has 
published a paper which explains a model 
he developed which accounts for the 
meandering of the stream. Oceanographers 
from around the world (including the 
USSR) are soon to start collecting data to 
be used as initial and boundary conditions 
of the model.
Other interesting applied math problems 
in addition to the efforts in continum
has brought with him a new degree. Applied
mechanics include Dr. Curtins and Dr. 
MacCameys work in the numerical 
modeling of evolutionary equations with 
memory effects. By applying these to 
population models they have shown that 
certain changes in the environment can 
result in extinction. Dr. Kortanek has been 
wofking on a project in pollution abate
ment which uses environmental quality 
optimization. The problem is how do you 
model the optimum control of the pollu
tion in a particular area.
Food Needs Examined

subscribing to regular contract service, an 
individual on this plan is allotted a certain 
value of coupons per week. He may spend 
as he pleases at either Morewood Gardens 
Cafeteria or Skibo - perhaps neglect break
fast one day but later enjoy a steak dinner. 
Thus, the student has greater freedom to 
choose how much he wants to eat, when he
wants to eat.
It is possible, according to Mr. Zalewski, 
that Mudge House may offer limited food 
service and that cooking facilities will be 
improved in dormitories wherever possible. 
Food contracts might be mandatory, how
ever, for Morewood residents, in order to 
eliminate safety hazards (people cooking in 
unsuitable areas).

Last week's passersby may have noticed an interesting clue in the case of the missing portrait of Andrew Carnegie, if they read the fence: 
"Andy Carnegie hung on a wall, Andy Carnegie had a great fall, all of Security and all the greenmen, couldn't find Andy to hang him again!

THE TARTANNovember 4, 1975Page 10
TIME OF THE CUCKOO
villianies of the main characters. Thompson 
is Oscar Levant on a bad day, totally con
vincing insofar as he is nothing like we be
lieve a madman to be. We see him extoll
ing the virtues of Big Nurse, telling us with 
each blessed word how he despises the 
bitch. His stoop-shouldered, broken little 
man expression, his trembling walk, which * 
looks as if with the next step he might 
accidently reveal himself, all add up to 
sheer brilliance. If the PPT has any sense of 
survival at all, it will scoop up these three 
artists for its permanent company.
The idea behind the creation of Chief 
Bromden, the supposedly deaf and dumb 
Indian who narrates the Ken Kesey novel v 
on which the play is based, goes totally 
against the rules of dramatic action, mak
ing him the most difficult character to 
bring to life. Playwright Dale Wasserman
strives for accessibility by giving the Chief 
several interior monologues that were, un
fortunately, pre-recorded in this produc
tion. A poor sound system, aggravated by a 
disconcerting musical track, left the audi^ 
ence cold to the Chief, until at last McMurphy draws him out of his catatonia.
But by then it is too late to become in
volved with this man, whom the play 
finally focuses on. The fault lies neither 
with Ralph Roberts competent portrayal, 
not with the excellent direction of John 
Going, but with the problem of bringing 
the ideas of a novel onto the stage intact.
The playwright should have brought some 
fresh conceptions of his own to the adapta
tion, rather than settle for occasional com
promises.-,
So flock to the North Side and catch 
the citys tyest available theatre experience. 
Cuckoos /Vest is playing through Novem
ber 16, with student tickets available for ^ 
matinee performances. I would recommend 
the spacious seating in Deck A, but the 
cramped quarters of the stage level are just 
right for striking up intimate friendships by 
the mere placement of an elbow or thigh.
by John Mangano
After a rather inauspicious debut, the 
Pittsburgh Public Theatre has suddenly 
become an invaluable force in the cultural 
life of the city with its amazing production 
of One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. Here 
is the perfect play for the unique environ 
ment of the Allegheny Community The
atre, with its multi-tiered seating arrange
ment which surrounds the playing area.
Totally inappropriate for the premiere 
presentation of The Glass Menagerie, it 
works wonderfully in creating the oppres
sive mood of the mental hospital in which 
Cuckoos Nest transpires.
j One of the big plusses is the strength 
of the ensemble as they unravel the saga of 
Randle P. McMurphys fight for the rights 
of his fellow patients to booze, gamble, 
screw and enjoy all other rights of the 
average male. His one incubus is Nurse 
Ratched, the heavy-duty matron who 
manages to squelch every revolt and 
insidious desire (such as the right to 
watch the Worlds Series on the ward 
TV); and ultimately, as a symbol of the 
establishment, (as the director so help
fully informs us in a program note) she 
triumphs by cutting all thoughts of insur
rection out of McMurphys head with a 
surgical knife. Still, Nest is predominately 
a comedy, as all good message plays are.
There is an uproarious basketball game, 
complete with a rim and backboard that 
suspiciously resembled a catatonic patient 
we had encountered in an earlier scene.
And the wedding of the wa/ds young 
virgin to McMurphys ex-flame is not only 
great fun, but good theatre as well: The 
toilet paper decorations, potted plant as 
wedding bouquet, and pre-nuptial toastmixed in a plasma bag and spiked with Tom Atkins bucks a world of sterile'sanity'in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest

?????????????????????
by Michael Marinangeli
November, the harbinger of bitter, 
biting frost, crispy brown leaves and 
Thanksgiving vacation, has finally arrived! 
Three more ruthless weeks and well be 
free, but until then we will presumably be 
diligently nurding away in our solemn 
campus cubicles. Dont despair though, 
there are plenty of ways to pass the time 
and alleviate some of the mental and 
physical strain that college excerts on our 
frail bodies. November is frothing with a 
variety of dazzling events that should 
definitely keep you and your friends out of 
the studious confines of your rooms.
To make things quick-and concise, there 
will be seven heavy-duty concerts this 
month. They are:
Civic Arena:
Nov. 7--Frank Zappa 
Nov. 14--B.T. Express and Cosey 
& the Sunshine Band 
Nov. 20~Edgar Winter 
Stanley Theatre:
Nov. 11-Crosby and Nash 
Nov. 18--Roxy Music and the Tubes 
Syria Mosque:
Nov. 17--Ritchie Blackmore 
Nov. 28--Janis Ian 
To my knowledge, none of these shows have 
been sold out yet, but if you want to see 
how much I really lie, call National Re
cord Mart at 687-9433 for further infor
mation.
Two other big bands are also coming 
back. On Sunday, November 9 at 7:30 pm 
Woody Herman and his Thundering Herd 
will appear in concert with the Ozanam 
Strings at Heinz Hall. Woody Hermans 
music spans not only generations but 
situations. He keeps up with the new, 
but he never forgets the great sound of the 
old. The Ozanam Strings have performed
in New York, Washington D.C. and New 
Orleans. Last year they sold out Heinz 
Hall for their benefit performance with 
Manny Ferguson. The teaming of the 
Ozanam Strings with Woody Herman and 
his Thundering Herd should produce a 
veritable stampede of musical delights. 
For more intense information call 371- 
4930.
Still on the subject of audio aesthtics, 
good vibes will be sounding forth at Walt 
Harpers Attic when the great vibraharpist 
Roy Ayers brings his very hot recording 
group to the Attic for five days beginning 
tonight, November 4th, through November 
8th. Roy, who for years was featured with 
the great Herbie Manns group (in fact, 
he was a member of the group when 
Herbie Mann played the Attic three years 
ago,) has since gone on to become a 
recognizable force in jazz himself. Attuned 
to the best elements of a wide variety of 
music, from jazz to soul to Latin and rock, 
he has gathered around him a crew of 
musicians who share his tastes and talents. 
Live and on record, their work is consis
tently exciting, soulful, and dynamic . . . 
and increasingly popular in both pop and 
jazz circles. Alltogether, Roy Ayers is one 
of the brightest aggregations in con
temporary music. There will be three 
shows nightly at the Attic. Remember 
though, no kiddies under 21 admitted here, 
so bring your I.D.s!
Gem enthusiasts should note that the 
Arts & Crafts Committee of the Duquesne 
University Program Board is sponsoring a 
Mineral and Gemstone Fair for the third 
consecutive year. The exhibit and sale will 
be held November 19-21 /in the Union 
ballroom, from 10 a.m. ^o 9 p.m. The 
fair features fossils, minerals, semi-precious 
and precious gemstones from around the 
world. A variety of articles will be for sale,

THE TARTANNovember 4, 1975Page 14sports
by Gerry Fraley
Being humiliated is never nice. The 
thought of what happened sticks in your 
mind, a nightmare that will-not leave. D0 
matter how long it takes, getting revenge 
is the only thing that can erase the memo
ryIt took a year to the day, but the Car
negie -Mellon Tartans got their revenge 
Saturday when they blasted the Allegheny 
Gators 23-3 in the season finale at Tech 
Field. A year ago, the Tartans were humil
iated 40-13 by Allegheny. It was a bitter 
defeat that ended a trying season.
Allegheny came into Tech Field with a 
big reputation.Ineligible for the Presidents 
Athletic Conference title due to a rules 
violation, they nonetheless possessed a 
5-1 season record, the second best overall 
defense among NCAA Division III teams, 
and a ranking of tenth among Division III 
teams nationally a week ago.
Their impressive credentials did nothing 
for the Gators. Pull out all the plugs, 
dish out more than they can handle, go 
completely berserk, and win the football 
game said a sign that hung in the Tartan 
locker room all week prior to the game. 
That is exactly what happened. Tech won a 
football game that definitely has to be a 
turning point in their football rejuvenation 
program. They proved that they can handle 
the big boys.
The game started out like it would be 
no contest, as Alleghenys offense moved 
quickly down the field on their first pos
sesion. The Tartan defense set their pattern 
for the day on this first series as they 
bent but didnt break, a rubber band de
fense of the first degree. Allegheny was 
able to move the ball all game, they picked 
up 272 yards total offense; 247 of it on the 
ground, but they were denied the big scor
ing play all day.
The Tartans got on the board early in 
the second quarter following a scoreless 
opening period. Starting with excellent 
field position on the Allegheny 49 follow
ing a weak punt, Tech put together their 
first offensive drive of the day. Quarter
back Pete Antamarino, making his first 
collegiate start, showed exceptional poise 
for a freshman when he withstood a heavy 
rush and hit split end Billy OMara for an
11 yard completion on a third and six sit
uation.
The completion to OMara moved the 
ball to the Allegheny 22. Tech was unable 
to generate any offense from here, so kick. 
er Tom McMeekin came in on fourth down 
to attempt a 40 yard field goal. McMeekin, 
a bare-foot, soccer style kicker, was perfect 
and the Tartans led 3-0 with 12:53 re
maining in the second quarter.
Calvin Scott recovered a fumble on Al
leghenys nexi possession but Tech was un
able to capitalize on the turnover. Dick
Allegheny's offense couldn't make the big plays in Saturday's
game against CMU. The win leaves CMU with a 5-3 record overall and a conference record of 4-3.

Jay Duquette, CMU's quarterback, scrambling for extra yardage against Allegheny.
31 to the Tartan 29 to move the Gators in
to scoring position. Just as Techs offense 
bogged down after big plays, Allegheny 
was unable to move after Matlacks big 
play. Allegheny kicker Nick Nardone came 
in to try a 39 yard field goal and was suc
cessful to cut Techs lead to 6-3 at the half.
The defense was directly responsible for 
the first touchdown of the game. On a 
second and ten play from his own 20, Al
legheny quarterback , Jim Schaeffer, rolled 
to the left looking to pass. Schaeffers pass 
was intercepted by strong safety John Bar
bour on the Gator 28. Barbour returned 
the interception to the Allegheny 4.
A motion penalty moved the ball to the 
nine. West picked up eight yards to the 
Gator one and crashed in on the next play 
for the score. McMeekin added the con
version and the Tartans led 13-3 with 
5:34 left in the third quarter.
West added credence to those who be
West, who averaged 41.8 yards on six 
punts, pinned Allegheny on their own 12 
with a 45 yard punt. Two Gator offensive 
plays produced nothing so they resorted 
to a quick kick on third down. The surprise 
tactic was not totally effective as it gave 
Tech possession on the Allegheny 40.
The combination of Antamarino to 
0Mara again came to the front as Tech 
moved for another score. The pai? came 
through again on a third and six situation, 
OMara making a 12 yard grab to move to 
the Gator 10. Alleghenys defense stiffened 
forcing McMeekin to make another appear
ance. The attempt was from 32 yards and 
there was never any doubt as McMeekin 
hit his second field goal of the game, to 
give Tech a 6-0 lead with 5:48 remaining 
in the half.
Allegheny did get their offense going 
after the ensuing kickoff. Fullback Mark 
Matlack rambled 40 yards from his own
lieve that he is the best back in the confer 
ence when he scooted 68 yards for a score 
early in the fourth quarter. West, a junioi 
from Monroeville, Pa., picked up 106 yards 
on 14 caries for the day to finish the sea 
son with 644 yards on 112 carries. West 
averaged 5.18 yards per carry for the sea
son. His touchdown run came on a perfect 
example of how the veer offense should be 
run. A perfect pitchout from quarterback 
Jay Duquette and super seal block by 
offensive tackle Eldridge Dudley and West 
was gone. McMeekin added the conversion 
and Tartans led 20-3 with 10:45 remaining 
in the game.
This score ended any doubt over the 
games outcome, but the Tartan offense 
wanted more. Duquette, who had replaced 
Antamarino in the second half, engineered 
a drive that moved from the Tartan 34 
to the Allegheny 20. McMeekin came on to 
do his thing from here when the march 
stalled. His 38 yarder was good and Techs 
lead was enlarged to 23-3, the games final 
score.
We did everything right both offen
sively and defensively said Tech head 
coach Joe Gasparella in the joyous locker 
room after the game.
The win ended Techs season with a 5-3 
mark, 4-3 in the conference. With only 
three seniors on the squad, the outlook for 
the 1976 edition of Tech football is bright. 
Saturdays win could be a preview of things 
to come.

CMUs Hockey leam opened its 1975-

Vincent College last Sunday evening in 
Greensburg. It took the Tartans two 
periods to get going as CMU broke a 2-2 
tie with two third period goals. Dave 
Cornelius, last years leading scorer, scored 
the winner on a quick wrist shot from the 
middle of the face off circle. Tom Grimm 
assisted on the goal as well as putting in 
an insurance slapshot from just outside 
the blue line.

Showing spirit and control, CMUs 
Womens Varsity Volleyball team beat 
Chatham College in a close match with the 
scores of 14-16, 15-8 and 15-2. Leading by 
only three or four points most of the first 
game, CMU was struggling with inconsis
tent services. Chatham played a defensive 
game and waited for CMU to make the 
mistakes. CMUs lead dwindled and 
Chatham tied up the score to 14-14. Un
settled by Chathams advance on their lead, 
CMU lost the next two points and there
fore lost the game to Chatham.
On the offensive for the second game, 
CMU exhibited the talents of their two 
setters and four spikers as they passed, 
set and spiked most of Chathams returns. 
Chatham tried valiantly, but were unable 
to return the direct offensive hits by Elly 
Zimmerman, Judy Parker, and Audrie 
Goldstein, and could offer none of their 
own to challenge CMUs control of the 
game. The offensive strategy and team 
communication brought the second and 
third games to CMU without a glimmer of 
hope for Chatham to take the lead. CMUs 
JV team also won their game against 
Chatham. They lost the first game to 
Chatham, but soon found their feet and 
won the next two games.
The second win of the season against 
W&J University, where the varsity team 
won easily in two games 15-0 and 15-11 
The first game began with W&J serving. 
The serve was no good so CMU got their 
chance. With their starting server, Judy 
Parker, serving 15 straight points, CMU had 
the first game in the bag. W&J was only 
able to return three of Judys serves and 
these returns were easily handled by Alrie 
Christian and Davina Davies, who set pertheir effortless win in the first game, CMU 
missed several serves and * made errors 
which could only have been a result of 
their relaxed state. W&J took the lead by 
four points. Judy Parker then served sever
al points which enabled CMU to pass W&J. 
From then on, the team showed their good 
form as they racked up another win. The 
JV also won easily in two games.
The team has a few difficulties to work 
out. One of their major difficulties is their 
services. The team plays well together, and 
with such a winning start can look forward 
to a great season. The next home game is 
Monday, November 10th at 7:00 against 
Seton Hill.

THE TARTAN-November 4,1975-Page 16
Buggy Comments
by L.S.D.C.
The third scheduled freeroll practice 
of the fall buggy season was cancelled the 
morning of Sunday October 26th due to 
the wet condition of the course. There had 
been a light rainfall the previous night but 
most of the buggy course had dried out by 
early Sunday morning and a safe freeroll 
should have been possible. However, the 
City of Pittsburgh came through and 
ruined the day. One of their street clean
ing machines was wandering through 
Schenley Park and very thoughtfully 
cleaned off the most crucial part of the 
course, the bottom of the hill coming into 
the turn. Its possible that the street clean
er was directed to .this part of the course 
by someone involved with Sweepstakes as 
no other part of the street in that area was 
cleaned. Street cleaning machines, in add
ition to cleaning streets, also make them 
very wet, as this helps in the cleaning pro
cess. The cleaner came by just before sun
rise and with the cold weather there was 
just not enough time for the street to dry 
out.
* There were quite a few organizations 
out that morning and they were all very 
anxious to roll. This presented Ms. 
Bothwell, the Sweepstakes Chairperson 
with her first tough decision. After careful 
consideration, she decided, shortly after 
7 am, that the course was too wet to 
safely conduct a freeroll at that time. 
While everyone there was quite anxious to 
roll, and some people probably thought 
that there should have been a freeroll, Ms. 
Bothwells decision was a good one and 
really, the only one that could logically 
have been made.
On another note of safety, the
Carnegie -Mellon University Radio Club 
has agreed to provide two-way radios to 
help with traffic control during all of the 
remaining treerolls this fall. Everyone 
involved with Sweepstakes is undoubtedly 
most thankful to the Radio Club for this 
service and the extra margin of safety that 
it will add to freeroll practices. The ROTC 
department had agreed to provide twoway radios for freerolls but their equip
ment will not be available utitil the spring 
so the Radio Club will be providing cover
age until then.
With Spring Carnival occurring so early 
next semester there may not be enough 
good weather before the races to insure an 
adequate amount of freeroll practices. 
With this in mind, the Sweepstakes Chair
person has scheduled seven fall freerolls, 
up to and including the morning of Nov
ember 23rd. With Pittsburghs quite 
unpredictable weather being better in the 
fall than in the spring during the past few 
years, these fall freerolls should insure 
a sufficient amount of practice time. 
However, only about half of all of the 
buggy Taring organizations have been out 
so far this fall. All of these organizations 
should be out practicing now because there 
may not be enough good weather next 
spring to provide an adequate number of 
freerolls for everyone. The more practice 
that your drivers get, the better your 
chances of winning are, and more impor
tantly, the safer the races will be next 
spring.
After the first fall freeroll three weeks 
ago, approximately fifteen bales of hay 
disappeared. If anyone happens to find 
these hay bales, please return them to Ms. 
Joan Bothwell, the Sweepstakes Chair
person.

SCORE 1305 AT MEET
by Mark Smith
The Tartan marksmen brought their 
season record to 2-1 and also posted 
the teams highest score in four years.
CMU was 5| points up on Grove 
City in last Wednesdays match. Steve 
Strom recorded his best match to date 
by shooting an excellent 276. Klemencic 
recorded his highest score to date with a 
261. The addition of Smiths 266, Beebes 
252; and Azingers 250 pushed the total 
to an outstanding 1305.
The first loss came Friday at the hands 
of perennial league champion, I.U.P.. They 
shot 1340 against CMUs 1271. The
scoring team consisted of Smith, Strom, 
Klemencic, Azinger, and Cicerchi. 
Mark Smiths 280 was the highest score 
shot by either of the two teams.
Next weeks match against another 
strong team, Clarion, should determine 
whether the Tartans will be competing 
against I.U.P. for the first place league 
standing.
