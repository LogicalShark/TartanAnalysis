Students and faculty were 
forced to end classes early and

Wednesday after a fire began on 
the roof. The building was evacu

ter a propane tank fell over.
Five roofers were iri the middle 
of repairs when the tank came in 
contact with a torch they were 
using, said Don Hale, vice presi

in front of Hunt Library reported 
seeing large flames arid billows 
of smoke coming from the 
buildings rooftop.
I was more impressed by 
the black smoke and the tar
odor than the flames, said 
Amanda Spear, a senior En

really short lived.
Two workers from Triangle 
Roofing suffered second de

West Penn Hospital.
The building was re
opened by 7 pm.
I was riding the bus up Forbes

Student Life official resigns from post
userte Miner-uixon/uarKroom Manager 
Allison Riley has announced her resignation 
after four years of service in Student Life.
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan News Editor
Allison Riley, associate director of Stu
dent Life and director of student develop
ment, has announced she will resign her 
position at the end of this semester. Riley is 
.moving to Boston where her husband has 
acquired a job with Bay Networks.
The thing that Im going to leave here 
knowing is that I was able to make a difference 
in the time that I was here, and I leave here 
having developed meaningful relationships 
with faculty, staff, and students, said Riley.
Her responsibilities have included coordi
nating development of first-year student 
programs, family programs, community ser
vice, and judicial affairs, as well as fostering 
leadership and personal development among 
students.
Allison Riley is an exceptional individual, 
said Michael Murphy, dean of Student Af
fairs. She has demonstrated through her 
own commitment what it means to be a 
member of a community of caring.... The 
very capable staff of professionals and stu
dents with whom she has worked will miss 
her profoundly.
Among Rileys.specific accomplishments 
has been her work with gender issues. 
She was on the planning-committee which, 
founded Mosaic, an annual CMU womens 
conference held in March. She has also 
worked closely with sexual assault advi
sors, a group of faculty, staff, and stu-. 
dents who are trained to counsel victims 
of sexual assault.
Allison has taught me a lot about how to 
be a leader, especially as a woman, said 
Christina Lopez, a senior in psychology who. 
has worked with Riley on gender issues. I;. 
just really admire her and am happy to have 
had the opportunity to learn from her. 
Riley said her commitment to gender is, 
sues at CMU, while part of her job, has also, 
been in large part a personal project.
Whats been nice for me about working 
with Dean Murphy is that hes allowed me to 
combine my areas of personal interest with 
areas that also fit under the umbrella of 
Student Life, said Riley.
There are lots of new initiatives happen
ing in gender issues [at CMU]. I see that that 
area is just going to continue to expand [in 
my absence], said Riley. I see that theres

Originally the band had asked for

has compromised and backed down on a

Roadblock runner 
wins settlement
PITTSBURGH (AP)  The city has 
agreed to pay $1.5 million to a motorcy
clist injured 18 years ago when he ran 
into a roadblock while fleeing police.
Henry F. Jodzis Jr. lost part of his leg 
after police chased him for running a 
stop sign. When Jodzis did not pull over, 
officers used a car as a roadblock on a 
narrow street.
Two juries, one in 1987 and one in
1995, found police violated a rule 
against using deadly force by setting 
up the roadblock without providing an 
escape route.
If the city had agreed to the original 
jury award, it would have paid Jodzis 
just $60,000. But a string of appeals 
ordered by the City Council led to heavy 
interest and a higher award.
City Solicitor Jacqueline Morrow said 
she decided not to appeal to the state 
Supreme Court because chances were 
slim the court would hear the case.
Jodzis will receive his first payment of 
$250,000 on November 30, said his law
yer, Edward Friedman.
Untreatable strain 
of TB emerges
WASHINGTON (AP)Hot zones of 
untreatable tuberculosis are emerging 
around the world and threaten a global 
crisis, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) said Wednesday.
A study of50,000 patients in 35 nations 
found that a third of the countries have a 
form of TB resistant to multiple drugs. 
Untreatable cases account for two per
cent to 14 percent of the world total.
That number is low, but WHO said 
lethal tuberculosis could spread rapidly 
because only one in 10 patients gets 
medical care appropriate to curb drug 
resistance.
Hot zones in India, Russia, Latvia, 
Estonia, the Dominican Republic, Argen
tina, and the Ivory Coast have so much 
drug-resistant TB that it threatens to 
overwhelm local health systems, said the 
study by WHO and U.S. health officials.
This study shows definitively, and for 
the first time, what we most feared but 
could not previously prove: Our world 
again faces the specter of incurable tu
berculosis, said Dr. Michael Iseman,
TB chief at the National Jewish Medical 
and Research Center in Denver, who 
reviewed the study. Drug-resistant TB 
is on every continent, probably in every 
country, he said.
Tuberculosis is the worlds top infec
tious killer. It is spread through cough
ing and sneezing and can be highly con
tagious the average patient infects 10 
to 20 people a year.
The World Health Organization an
nounced last spring that TBs global 
spread had finally leveled off, but the 
new study looks specifically at killer 
drug-resistant forms.
Tuberculosis often can be cured with a 
combination of four drugs taken for six 
to eight months.
But many patients, especially in poor 
countries, stop taking the drugs when 
they feel better or run out of money, 
which allows the TB still in their bodies 
to mutate so that one or more medicines 
no longer work. This acquired drug re
sistance is entirely preventable with 
proper care, WHO said.
These people also can spread drugresistant TB to new patients, a circum
stance that gives patients what is called 
primary drug resistance.
The WHO study found spots where 
resistance to a single drug is alarmingly 
highit reached 100 percent of treated 
but not cured TB patients in Ivanovo 
Oblast, Russia, about 180 miles east of 
Moscow. These people can be treated 
with other drugs, but theyre in danger 
because the TB germ must make just 
one more mutation to become multidrug 
resistant  and lethal.
Places with low levels of multidrugresistant TB included Kenya, with no 
cases; Australia and New Zealand, each 
with less than one percent; and the 
United States, with two percent.
Hundreds protest 
in Israeli capital
JERUSALEM (AP)  Hundreds of 
Israelis demonstrated Friday outside 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus 
home, demanding he resign for saying 
dovish Israelis have forgotten what it 
means to be Jewish.
Among the 400 demonstrators were 
two dozen middle-aged army reservists 
who had marched for three days, start
ing out at the Tel Aviv square where 
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
was assassinated by an ultranationalist 
Jew in November 1995.
Other demonstrators carried signs 
saying, There is no peace and there is 
no security, a reference to Netanyahus 
1996 campaign slogan promising he 
would deliver both.
Netanyahus opponents have accused 
him of willfully destroying the peace 
process with the Palestinians by going 
back on earlier agreements and refusing 
to make concessions.
US citizens turn 
back the clocks
WASHINGTON (AP)  If youve not 
already set your clock back an hour, 
your first class today probably looked 
remarkably empty.
For those who remembered on Sun
day, it was time for another American 
ritual: setting the clocks back.
The official hour of change was 2 am 
Sunday, local time, though most folks 
made the change before hitting the sack, 
gaining an extra hour of sleep.
Daylight-savings time returns the first 
Sunday in April.
New test product 
reduces smoke
NEW YORK (AP)  Philip Morris 
Cos. is testing a tobacco system that 
uses a special cigarette and pager-sized 
lighter to reduce smoke, ash, and odor.
The company said today it plans to 
give the Accord smoking system to about 
100 adult smokers in the United States 
and Japan.
The battery-powered system allows 
the cigarette to burn only when smokers 
lift the entire device to their lips and 
take a puff, the company said.
The device is designed to eliminate 
the smoke from a burning cigarette that 
accounts for 90 percent of secondhand 
smoke. Smokers will still inhale the same 
amount of tar and nicotine in conven
tional ultralight cigarettes, and they will 
still exhale smoke.
The company said smokers can wait 
as long as they want between puffs. 
After the last puff, the smoker ejects the 
cigarette. The cigarettes will cost up to 
$2.75 a pack. The cigarette holder, a 
battery charger, and a pack of Accords 
will be sold in starter boxes for $50.2An/ Aefrcrsf cFfrs iFSsr 2Oen hOen bFcgrfs fO TFCC fO rFcUCOen COx
HONG KONG (AP)  Hong 
Kong stocks suffered their worst 
fall in a decade Thursday in a 
burst of panic selling triggered 
by rocketing interest rates and 
fears that the vibrant Hong Kong 
economy may be infected by tur
moil elsewhere in Asia.
Financial Secretary Donald 
*Tsang disclosed that monetary 
authorities were forced to dip into 
Hong Kongs foreign exchange cof
fers to sell U.S. dollars overnight 
and support the Hong Kong cur
rency. This triggered interest rate 
bikes that pounded the stock mar
ket Thursday morning, he said, 
but added that it was the price of 
defending the currencys peg to the 
XJ.S. dollar, our top priority.
The key blue chip index, theHang 
Seng, shed 14 percent in morning 
trading before recovering slightly. 
The losses hammered down 
Tokyos Nikkei Stock Average by 
3.03 percent, and shares also took 
a further battering in Malaysia, 
Singapore, Indonesia, and the Phil
ippines  as well as halfway 
around the world in London.
Analysts said the Hang Sengs 
plunge raised the question of 
whether Hong Kong can continue 
to insulate itself from the rest of 
Asia despite fundamental eco
nomic distinctions.
Where other Asian economies 
are perceived as suffering seri
ous institutional flaws, Hong 
Kongs system is the Interna
tional Monetary Funds model. 
Its problems stem mostly from 
having the only Asian currency 
still pegged to the U.S. dollar.
That makes it the only currency 
that could still tempt concerted 
speculative attack. Hong Kong au
thorities say they will fight back 
at all costs because they view a 
stable, dollar-pegged currency as 
vital to maintaining international 
confidence in Hong Kong now that 
China has taken the former colony 
over from Britain.
Steven Xu, an economist at 
Standard Chartered Bank, said 
he was confident the peg would 
stay, but if every country in 
Asia, starting with Japan, has to 
go through a deflationary pro
cess, it seems Hong Kong cannot 
be spared.
Thursdays plunge followed three 
days of falls that had already 
shaved 14 percent from the 
markets value since Friday. The 
market has lost one-third of its 
value since hitting a high of 
16,673.27 on Aug. 7. The Hang 
Seng, which closed at 11,637.77 
Wednesday, dipped below the
10,000 level Thursday. It closed at 
10,426.3, down 10 percent for the 
day and 23 percent for the week.
Anson Chan, Hong Kongs top 
civil servant, urged calm. Hong 
Kong cannot escape being af
fected in the short term by whats 
happening in the region, she 
told reporters.

50 YEARS AGO, No vember 25, 
1947  President Robert E. 
Doherty deliveredhis State of CIT 
address to the student body at the 
culmination of the annual Carn
egie Day exercises. He said that 
despite the fact that students 
rarely see him, they should not 
conclude that he is not interested 
in them. I am in there working 
for you to get the best faculty, best 
educational program, and as good 
facilities as possible. He also ad
dressed frequent requesst from 
the students for a better football 
team. We cant have both Class A 
football and professional educa
tion unless we set football up with 
special educational programs for 
the squad, and this we cannot do.
25 YEARS AGO, October 31, 
1972  Rev. Jesse Jackson was 
the guest lecturer for the course 
Power Structures and Organiza
tional Activity. Jackson said he 
believes that if one accepts his 
own essence and condition, the 
first criteria for power is fulfilled. 
If ones personality is split, his 
mind will be weak, and he will 
not hold any power. Ultimately, 
he says, the way to reach the 
power within ourselves is to ad
dress oneself to the needs of the 
people. He also discussed how 
Americas power structure was, 
according to him, headed in the 
wrong direction.
10 YEARS AGO, October 27, 
1987  A memorial in honor of 
Carnegie Mellon alumna Judith 
Resnik was planned to be erected 
in front of Hamerschlag Hall. The 
memorial was sponsored by Tau 
Beta Pi, the engineering honor 
society of which Dr. Resnik was a 
member. Patterned after Tau 
Beta Pis official symbol, the tri
angular bent, the monument rep
resents over a year of organiza
tion and effort towards a more 
permanent and visible reminder 
of the humanity vested in the 
engineering disciplines. The me
morial is made from solid brass 
and is set into a semi-circular 
slab of granite. The face of this 
base is covered by a bronze plaque 
detailing the career of Resnik 
including her tenure with NASA.
FIVE YEARS AGO, October 
26, 1992  Estimates made by 
the student government trea
surer indicated that Student Sen
ate would encounter some prob
lems at the budget hearings. He 
said that the remaining $95,000 
from the years Activities Fee 
would not be enough to cover the 
budgets of student organizations 
that are recognized and funded 
by Student Senate. He said that
Senate needed to be especially 
aware of the situation, and that it 
could not rely on the appearance 
of magic money.
ONE YEAR AGO, October 28, 
1996  Computing Services had 
been working on upgrading the 
campus network in a project still 
being implemented, called Net
work 2000. The Network 2000 
initiative officially started in 
January of 1996. The long-term 
plan was to deploy the new sys
tem in all academic buildings on 
campus with dormitories and fra
ternities to follow. The final goal 
was to increase the bandwidth of 
all networked computers by hook
ing them up to either a shared 
100 Mbps (megabits per seconds) 
line or a switched 10 Mbps line.

[The problem] is not so much

that Rangos doesnt have some of

Fire causes evacuation of Wean Hall

someone had stolen a purse. 
While the injuries from the fire 
were kept to a minimum and evacu
ation of the building occurred 
within 15 minutes of notification of 
the fire, a number of doctoral stu
dents have been wary of Weans 
fire alarm system for some time 
now  they fear that Wean Halls 
alarm system is outdated to the 
point that it is a fire hazard for 
occupants of the building.
Almost everyone ignored [the 
alarm] until the police came in 
and evacuated personally, said 
Corey Kosak, a doctoral student 
in computer science. It seems to 
be a big problem if you cant hear 
the alarm well if your door is 
closed or if you have music play
ing in your office.
Kosak and a number of his 
colleagues in the computer sci
ence department have been ac
tively complaining about the 
poor sound quality of the fire 
alarm systems in Wean and
Doherty Halls for two years 
now. The current bell that is 
activated in these buildings re
sembles a cowbell, according 
to David Eckardt, a doctoral stu
dent in electrical and computer 
engineering. And [it] only rings
Once the alarm sounds, the 
paper tape system that is in 
place in these buildings 
punches a bell pattern on to a 
tape that fire fighters read in 
order to identify the exact loca
tion of the fire. The ringing

utes of activation in order to 
prevent the pattern from run

This is really ancient tech
nology, he said. Were stunned 
that its legal.
But according to Vice Presi
dent of Business Affairs Ron 
Carter the alarm system works 
fine. Perhaps if we actually held 
fire drills more often people 
would be more familiar with the 
sound of the alarms, he said. 
Mock drills will make people 
more aware of the system.
While GSA representative in 
computer science Will Yuther 
claims there hasnt been a will 
to move forward on any kind 
of renovation of Wean alarms 
on the part of administration, 
plans to modernize the sys
tems are underway, accord

two years, he said.
But I dont think they real
ize that its serious that the 
alarms lack that certain alarm

[GSA] is setting wheels in 
motion to approach the admin
istration about this problem so 
it can be dealt with soon.
Crime and Incident Report
10/18 HOT-AIR BALLOON 
DEFLATION, 1:30 am  While 
on fraternity patrol, an officer 
noticed three males run across 
Forbes Avenue and jump into the 
Homecoming hot-air balloon. The 
actors then proceeded to turn off 
the compressor, causing the bal
loon to deflate. The officer stopped 
the actors and identified them. 
While interviewing the actors, the 
smell of alcohol began to perme
ate the air. The officer asked them 
if they had been drinking. They 
admitted they had had some beer 
and were issued state citations 
for underage consumption. They 
were also issued internal cita
tions for disorderly conduct.
10/19 MUSIC CONTRO
VERSY, 12:04 amA dispatcher 
received a call from a woman ob
jecting to the lyrics being played 
on WRCT. She said that she heard 
countless obscenities and was of
fended by them. She maintained 
that a censored version of the rap 
music was available and that 
WRCT is breaking federal law by 
airing such trash. When the po
lice further investigated the mat
ter, they found that WRCT was, 
in fact, not breaking the law. The 
FCC only prohibits the DJ from 
using obscene language. While 
the radio station does not favor 
such music, it has a safe harbor 
period from 10 pm until 6 am 
when any type of music is permit
ted. The next day, the woman 
called to complain that WRCT 
continued playing offensive rap 
music despite her requests. The 
situation was explained to her.
10/19 MEDICAL, 9:07 pm  
An officer was dispatched to Skibo 
Gym for a medical call. Upon ar
rival, a member of CMU EMS 
was already examining the in
jured person. During a game, he 
had been struck in the mouth 
with the butt end of a hockey 
stick. He sustained small cuts to 
the lips and had a front tooth 
broken in half. He was trans
ported to UPMC.
10/20 POSSESSION OF 
FALSE ID, 3:59 pm  While on 
patrol on September 5, a detec
tive spotted two students carry
ing a case of beer. One of them
possessed identification saying 
that he was a CMU alumnus. 
Subsequent investigation re
vealed that he was not who he 
claimed to be. The detective ob
tained a search warrant and went 
to their room in Resnik. After a 
search of the area, he found a half 
empty 1.75 liter bottle of Bacardi 
Rum. He searched the person who 
previously had the false identifi
cation. The ID was found on him, 
and it was confiscated along with 
the rum.
10/23 MEDICAL, 8:00 pm  A 
CMU student requested medical 
transport, so an officer was dis
patched to his Cathedral Mansions 
apartment. He said that he slid 
across the floor of his apartment, 
and that was when the two-inch 
splinter entered his foot. He had 
spent 45 minutes trying to get the 
splinter out but to no avail, and now 
he was getting desperate. He was 
driven to Presbyterian Hospital.
10/25 UNDERAGE POSSES
SION OF AN INTOXICATED 
PERSON, 12:51 am  A secu
rity guard radioed Campus Po
lice to inform them of two males 
carrying a third up Forbes Av
enue. An officer responded and 
stopped the trio. The three were 
identified, and all were under
age. The person who was being 
carried was highly inebriated, 
and so he was issued a state cita
tion for underage drinking. The 
pair who were assisting him said 
that they would keep an eye on 
him for the remainder of the night.

Study Abroad Office 
should be expanded
Although study abroad pro
grams are gaining popularity 
each year, CMUs Study Abroad 
office fails to provide students 
with proper direction when they 
approach the idea of spending 
time in another country. The 
problem is not a lack of avail
able information; the office 
shelves are stacked with books 
full of information about many 
study abroad programs and op
portunities. Rather, the prob
lem lies in inadequate human 
resources to provide students 
with the advice and guidance 
they need in order to make the 
necessary decision wisely.
As it stands, students are gen
erally directed toward one or 
two study abroad advisors, 
while more than 120 students 
per year show interest in po
tentially studying abroad. 
Though the current advisors 
can successfully point students 
to the right books to find the 
programs they might be inter
ested in, students need more 
than a librarian for a decision 
that affects them not only aca
demically but also personally.
Students need study abroad 
advisors that can connect their 
needs with appropriate pro
grams.
Students also need an advi
sory system that will help them 
coordinate course credit trans
fers between universities and 
determine what kinds of finan
cial help is available to them. 
Since the majority of students 
enter into programs which are 
not CMU-sponsored, there is
little information about the pro
cedures of study abroad host 
schools.
Students are told to seek 
scheduling help from academic 
advisors, but it is the responsi
bility of the study abroad office 
to provide guidance to students. 
They should be the link between 
CMU and the host schools. Too 
often students dont know who 
to talk to and go on faith that 
their courses will transfer.
Students wishing to study 
abroad also have difficulty in 
assessing their options of finan
cial aid. As The HUB is rarely 
familiar with the policy of host 
schools, it is up to the Study 
Abroad Office to provide infor
mation on possible resources.
It is true that students must 
take initiative in endeavors 
such as studying abroad. While 
they dont need someone mak
ing all the decisions for them, 
some direction is necessary. 
Currently, the study abroad of
fice holds an information ses
sion each semester for students 
interested in studying abroad 
and an orientation for students 
prior to their departure. These 
are helpful steps, but more per
sonal interaction is needed. The 
study abroad office should be 
an open resource of informa
tion and support for students 
who are making important aca
demic and social decisions. 
More advisors and better com
munication and coordination 
between students, host schools, 
and home departments are a 
necessity.
Family Weekend 
needs student focus
Family Weekend provides a 
time for parents and siblings to 
acquaint themselves with their 
students life at college, but the 
current program serves to high
light University achievements 
rather than students experiences 
and accomplishments. While 
Student Life plans a myriad of 
events for families to partake in, 
these events lack proper focus.
Lectures such as The Social 
Security Crisis for Real  The 
Economic Impact of an Aging 
Population and NASAs 
Manned Spacecraft Computers 
give families a slice of successful 
faculty research and tout CMUs 
reputation as a leading research 
institution, but by this point, 
most families are already sold on 
the school. They attend Family 
Weekend so they can see how 
students spend theirtime, where 
they eat, and who they live with 
and to meet their friends.
While events such as the 
Presidents address generally 
catch the eye of visiting parents, 
the overall program would be 
enhanced with events geared to
wards both students and par
ents. For example, a parent-student dinner in Rangos hall would 
give families an opportunity to 
meet other families. In addition 
to the typical campus tour that 
most students take before they

Recycling on cam
pus has come under 
fire lately, and the 
controversy that has 
ensued only serves 
to complicate the isdecide to attend CMU, a tour of 
different academic buildings in 
relation to the amount of time 
students spend there might be 
more beneficial over Family 
Weekend. Families might find a 
tour of dorm rooms to be a good 
way to acquaint themselves with 
life at CMU. While details such 
as on-campus eating venues, 
study areas, and classroom 
spaces might seem trivial, it is 
important to remember that not 
all family members have at
tended college and have never 
experienced what life is like on 
campus, especially this campus.
Another problem that stifles 
the potential of Family Weekend 
programming is that it shares a 
weekend with the International 
Festival. While many families 
both attend and appreciate the 
events planned by Student Ac
tivities for the International 
Festival, Family Weekend tends 
to get lost in its shadow. Perhaps 
with better publicity of Family 
Weekend events, Student Lifes 
hard work in planning these 
events would pay off in higher 
attendance rates. But the best 
way to make Family Weekend 
meet the interests of students 
and visiting families is to create 
more family-oriented programs 
as opposed to an entire weekend 
of CMU promotional events.
sue. Whats the issue? Whats up with recycling on campus? 
What is our deal here at CMU? The deal is really quite simple 
 CMU is a very environmentally 
conscious school with a potentially ef
fective program that has always and 
will always require the help of us, the 
students.
The facts simply cannot be ignored.
Our past and present recycling efforts 
are significant and plenty. In 1990, we 
adopted a university policy that has 
since been exceeded and improved.
For example, in 1990 we adopted Penn
sylvania Act 101 that, for the munici
pality of Pittsburgh, requires office 
paper, cardboard, aluminum cans, and 
leaf waste to be recycled. CMU has 
exceeded the provisions of Act 101 to' 
include numerous different types of 
paper (including telephone directories, 
newsprint, magazines, and many 
more), steel cans, glass (of all colors), 
beverage container lids (must be removed from bottles), and 
plastics (#1 and #2).
In addition, considering our extensive computer use, we 
have enacted different programs for recycling computers, 
disks, manuals, and toner cartridges.
The organization of the program has also been continuously 
reconsidered. The most recent effort is to redefine the existing 
university policy to a more active standpoint stressing the 
reduction of materials, resources and waste. The list really 
does go on, from efforts of alumni to the Green Design 
initiative. From the Recycling Advisory Board meeting quar
terly from 1990 to 1996 to review the recycling policy to the 
various student organizations concerning environmental prac
tices, one can observe the various efforts supporting our 
program. It is impossible to deny that there is a significant 
incentive at CMU towards environmental practice, especially 
when considering its milestone victory in 1994 when receiving 
the Three Rivers Environmental Award.
This is not to imply that the program is perfect. The clarity, 
ease, and accessibility of the program is dubious. Recycling 
containers are sometimes indistinguishable from trash con
tainers. No one seems to be clear enough on what goes where. 
Also the organization, or hierarchy of the coordinators, of the 
program has some quirks that may ultimately result in an 
unintentional lack of initiative.
Yet these minor inadequacies pale in comparison to the 
mammoth responsibility of us, the 
students, to getting the job done. 
Reduce and reuse always should 
be our motto. But when it comes to 
recycling, we must recycle, and 
make the effort not only to recycle 
but to recycle rightly.
To recycle means that when we 
come into possession of a recyclable 
material we must actively seek a 
means to recycle that product. In 
addition, we must actively seek 
recyclable products made from re
cycled materials.
To recycle rightly we must not 
contaminate recycle containers. 
These containers, usually marked 
in some distinguishable manner, 
cannot be used as substitutes for 
trash receptacles. When a recycle 
container gets contaminated past its acceptable level (which 
is practically any contamination at all), the materials, and, 
consequently, the efforts put into recycling those materials, 
get thrown away.
This is not done in brash, unwarranted opposition by the 
custodial services to the student body but is a contracted 
policy and remains a codified method. Another right mea
sure we can take is designating recycling containers in our 
rooms and in any common academic setting that requires 
our daily attendance.
Its just the attention to detail in our lives and the informed 
decisions we make that can forge the gap in CMUs already 
motivated policy. For any recycling program to work, it must 
have recyclers recycling rightly, contributing to make a 
difference.

I have noticed that students around 
here are not quite cognizant of the ethi
cal implications created by their field of 
study. I have pondered over this matter 
ever since setting my toes here. Although 
I agree with the students ideas for a 
durative period, my beliefs on ethics 
now as related to general fields of study 
rest at the opposing end.
Everyone who attends college must 
necessarily notice the differences in vari
ous fields  particularly if the fields are 
distantly related, that is, fields that af
fect or involve differing sectors of soci
ety. For example, a man creating an 
ultra air compressor for hand-held drills 
will influence society quite unlike an 
owner of a small business. The ways 
that they interact with society and the 
roles associated with having such an 
interface differ radically. Thus, for one 
or the other, ethical correlation might 
present itself more directly. What this 
means is simply that one man needs to 
regard direct ethics as opposed to side
long ethics.
In my example, I think most would 
abide to the declaration that the small 
business owner (say, named Tetsuo) 
deals with ethics more nakedly than the 
air-compressor-toggling mechanical en
gineer (lets say, Dr. Sload). Throughout 
Tetsuos day, he must deal with immedi
ate consequences to his decisions and 
their ethical validity: A) If he fires a good 
man, the good man and his family will 
suffer unjustly, which could eternally 
rest on Tetsuos conscience if the good 
man chose to commit suicide thereafter. 
B) It might be cheaper to dump the 
companys garbage into the nearby brook, 
or release an illegal amount of danger
ous emmissions into the environment. 
However, the legal problems and 
Tetsuos conscience (or concern for his 
and others posterity) will chide him into 
making the righteous decision.
Tetsuo must deal with ethics daily; 
they are a fundamental element in his 
routine. Now, consider Sloads case. 
Lets say, he nudges a slot in his air 
compressor standard model which causes 
it to blow up when the hand drill is used 
for two hours without interruption.
Unless a fanatic driller manages to 
use a hand drill for two hours straight, 
Dr. Sload will never even know he dealt 
with an ethical problem when revolu
tionizing the air compressor.
If Sload does consider ethics, it will be 
an ethics too distant to instill fear or 
ethical weight upon his compressor de
cisions. In truth, his work does not nec
essarily require a familiarity with ethi
cal concepts; his is a virtual ethics: when 
it does come up, he merely instructs his 
intellect to be more meticulous in his
calculations where they might affect hu
mans or their safety. But, most  or 
much of  scientific work does not di
rectly affect humans in the way that 
Tetsuos work does, and Sload can go 
back to.being less careful  and less 
ethical  about his calculations.
My point? Ethics and fields of study do 
not always relate to each other in com
patible or adhesive fashions. Of course, 
every field has its ethical worries. And 
so does every unrolling of toilet paper. 
But, such a hiatus exists between the 
degree with which ethics affects one 
field in contrast to another that an Ab
solute Ethical Inclusion theory cannot 
apply to all fields of study.
If Logouda studies Mathematics, she 
is entitled to worrying less about ethics 
than her friend Semotoi, who studies 
Medicine. I think ethics should indeed 
serve as a crux to facing the importance 
of ones studies, but do not see it either 
as a necessity or an impediment to(func
tioning in society.
If the Sloads of the world thought too 
much about the ethical implications of 
their work, they would turn into manda
rin-robed ascetics, totter their way up 
the Himalayas, and leave us with handdrills that blow up after two hours of 
continuous usage.

Lets talk about whining. Im willing to bet 
I that weve all done it countless times during 
our respective stays at CMU, and that well 
jail continue to do it until we graduate, at 
J which time we can either start complaining 
I about graduate school or the rat race. Now, 
I typically, the term complain has negative 
I connotations.
j So, why do we do this? Have you ever 
J wondered? Have you ever even noticed that 
I we do this so often?
I Well, I have noticed it among the students, 
I and I think that one reason we complain so 
 often is because we feel the need to vent 
I almost constantly. Thats understandable, 
I thoughCMUs a tough school, and classes 
| can get to us sometimes, so we feel better 
when we complain about them.
Heres an example: Lets say Im having 
trouble in 15-127. (Imagine that!) So, I call 
the class dumb and worthless, wondering 
why we could ever need to know all that crap 
we learn in there (when will I ever need 
mathematical induction outside of class?), 
and my day brightens immeasurably.
Brightens, that is, until I have to sit down 
and tackle the material again; and then its 
stress city, all over again  as much as I 
complain, Im always going to have to come 
back to the work, so complaining just wastes 
my time because its only a temporary relief. 
And this short-term relief is hardly justified 
in the long term, not only because its fleet
ing, but also because it comes only at the 
expense of others happiness.
See, when Im feeling pretty happy about 
my life, the last thing that I want to hear is 
somebody telling me how terrible things are 
with class, or life in general.
That just depresses me, and I end up 
writing an article like this, complaining about
the complainers! Putting aside the hy
pocrisy for now, though, there have to be 
other ways to vent.
For example, if you need to complain, 
then write about it. Maybe you can write 
an email to a friend and then just not 
send it (silent venting).
Of course, there are other ways to 
vent, and ultimately, we wouldnt have 
to vent at all if we could see things in a
a difficult class, and then I did what I 
could  to learn things as well as 
possible and if I made a C on that 
quiz, or only got half the points on that 
homework, I realized that it didnt 
matter in the long run (there are more 
important things in life than my 127 
grade).
I just made sure to learn from my 
mistakes. So proper perspective can
proper perspective.
Back to my 15-127 example. If Im 
having difficulties, then I should just 
admit to myself that its hard, that I 
cant do it by myself, and that I need to 
go get help.
This example is somewhat reality-based 
(like one of those inane TV movies): The 
class is hard, but Im not just complaining 
about it. (Well, all right, I do sometimes, 
but Im getting better.)
Rather, I recognized that it was simply
Mark Adato/Tartan Assistant Art Editor 
take away a need to vent, which can 
take away a need to complain, which 
can actually make you (and others) 
happier people.
But what about the other times we 
complain, when were not just venting? 
What if we complain just to complain? 
Like how some people are towards the 
Purnell Center.
Well, think about it: you might as 
well be optimistic about it because, 
unless youre one of the more highly
ranked officials here, youre not going to be 
able to do a thing about it.
In fact, most times when we complain 
just to complain, its absolutely worth
less, because we cant do much about it 
anyway. Take the time youd spend com
plaining and do something concrete in
stead; complaining alone gets you nowhere. 
Maybe, though, people are complaining to 
fit in!
Lets say that I want to get to know the 
people in my biology class a little better, 
but I dont really have anything to say to 
them. Well, wait  I can always com
plain to them about class!
We have that in common, right?
So Ill make fun of the teacher, or talk 
about how impossible the class is, or ... 
well, you get the point.
Complaining to make friends is point
less, though, because friendship based 
solely on a common link of complaint 
probably isnt going to turn out to be 
much of a friendship at all; I tend to look 
for deeper connections in my friends.
So there are plenty of reasons to com
plain, and there are really plenty of things 
about which to complain, even if I do, 
perhaps, make it seem as if the com
plaints center around classes and con
struction.
I chose these two because they seem to 
be hot topics around here.
Perhaps my arguments will make you 
think a little; but if they dont, then at 
least try this little experiment: Try lis
tening to people sometime when theyre 
whining about something or other, and 
think objectively about what theyre say
ing and how it sounds.
Tune in attentively  Ill bet that you 
wont like what you hear and think: Do 
you want to hear this in yourself?

Back in the days of the 
Watergate hearings, there was a 
large quest for a smoking gun: a 
piece of evidence which would be. 
blatant enough' to finally send 
Nixon packing.
It took quite a while for one to 
surface, but when it did, things 
went quickly after that. The piece 
of evidence was a missing section 
of some tapes which were kept for 
biographical purposes. Right now, 
another smoking gun in the con
temporary scandals may well 
have come out, and its on tape 
again.
Clinton has been having his 
presidential reign captured on 
video for posterity (actually van
ity), and the release of the tapes 
is getting him in trouble much 
like in Watergate.
Well, I suppose, as a contrast, 
Nixon did erase his tape, while 
the coffee videos including the 
incriminating evidence from the 
Clinton White House passed on 
through. Actually, just some of 
the incriminating evidence was 
allowed to pass; it appears from
sound tracks which arent wholly 
present and other irregularities 
that some of the tapes may have 
been altered.
The funny thing is that, after 
six months of ignoring requests 
for the tapes from a Senate com
mittee, the White House sent 
them along just as Attorney 
General Janet Reno announced 
that there was no evidence immemos that had come out a while 
back  memos which to Reno 
werent evidence. These were in 
tandem with the renting out of 
the Lincoln Bedroom for around 
$50K a night.
The most interesting thing seen 
in the tapes so far (other than the 
possible editing) has been a sec
tion where Clinton admits using 
soft money to promote his re"The most interesting thing seen in the 
tapes so far (other than the possible ed
iting) has been a section where Clinton 
admits using soft money to promote his 
re-election campaign.
plicating the president. Of 
course, there already was evi
dence, even though many key 
witnesses have fled the coun
try. Yet this new bit was so 
blatant that even Reno had to 
start looking like she was on 
the job.
These tapes are from the fa
mous coffee klatches. These were 
fundraising events where time 
with Clinton was sold for $15K a 
head. They had been discussed in
election campaign.
I know most people dont know 
what soft money is, so Ill give a 
quick run-down. Under the cur
rent campaign finance laws, do
nations are divided into two 
types  hard money and soft 
money. Hard money is quite 
straightforward: It is the money 
that is given directly to a 
politicians campaign.
A single donor can give a 
maximum of $1000 in a single
year. Soft money donations 
can be of unlimited amounts, 
but can only be given to par
ties, not candidates, and can
not be used for anything other 
than party-building activities.
This means that I can give a 
check for $50K to the Democrats 
(not bloody likely), and they can 
spend this on ads which promote 
their views against those of their
-------- opponents, but cannot
use the money for ads 
which promote a specific 
candidate, or as part of 
such an election program. 
Yes, I know this is .a bit 
convoluted, but thats the 
law.
So where did Clinton 
go wrong? Well, on one of
-------- the videos, he came out
and bragged to his do
nors how he had found a way to 
use the big donations in his favor.
He talked about using soft 
money to design and run com: 
mercials in areas where he had 
done poorly in the previous elec
tion, and how this allowed him to 
just go after the big donors.
The tape shows that he was 
quite proud of finding his way 
around the laws, and using the 
soft money to prop up his poll 
number (which he bragged about).
This is a clear example of a smok
ing gun.
He both conspired to violate, 
and did violate, the campaign fi
nance laws which do exist. This is 
illegal, plain and simple.
If one did have a reason to ad
mire a man for being a scoundrel, 
one would certainly admire 
Clinton. Even as the extent to 
which he manhandled and broke 
the current finance laws is be
coming public, he has been push
ing for new laws.
Of course, these new laws dont 
give a damn about constitutional 
free speech concerns.
Of course, they also assume 
that for some reason people will 
be more likely to follow them 
than the current ones which 
Clinton and company have so 
blithely disregarded.
Of course, the press doesnt 
have the common sense or the 
journalistic integrity to bother 
running down these stories  
not that Im surprised. Im just 
hoping that eventually people will 
get sick enough of the sleaze to 
finally shut them down.

In the wee small hours of 
the morning on Saturday, Oc
tober 18, several other mem
bers of the CMU Objectivist 
Club and I painted the Fence, 
covering up Communist sym
bols and slogans and replac
ing them with dollar signs and 
praise for capitalism.
The Fence stood as we left it 
for all of Saturday, and I hoped 
to see it that way through Sun
day, as well.
My hopes rose as I saw the 
Fence unchanged at 1:30 am 
Sunday morning.
When I returned two hours 
later, however, the Fence had 
been vandalized.
Not painted over, but liter
ally vandalized. Someone with 
a couple of cans of spray paint 
had changed and distorted our 
words, leaving the Fence to 
equate capitalism with fas
cism and stupidity.
The majority of the Fence
Thus, I meet many people who 
disagree with me on fundamen
tal principles. Whenever I speak 
or discuss or argue, however, I 
retain a certain respect for ideas 
as such, not just the ideas I 
personally hold.
The Fence itself, whose very pur
pose is none other than to broadcast 
messages to the entire campus, is a 
symbol of [respect for ideas]. 
stood as it had two hours ear
lier; but the essential parts had 
been mutilated.
I decided that while I did not 
have the resources to repair the 
Fence, I could at least make 
sure that the derogatory com
ments did not last until dawn.
With a brush and a can of 
white paint from the closet in 
Doherty Hall, I covered over the 
markings, leaving the Fence in 
a confused and disorderly state. 
I returned to my room disheart
ened and disgusted.
I had expected to see the Fence 
covered. I had not expected to 
see it desecrated. The vandalization of the Fence is an attack 
on one of the fundamental prin
ciples of this university: the 
principle that ideas are 
important.As a student of phi
losophy, I hold opinions on al
most every intellectual topic, 
from metaphysics to morality 
to economics.
As a student of objectivism, 
the philosophy of Ayn Rand, 
most of my ideas run counter to 
the dominant opinions of today.
However wrong I may judge 
another person to be, I still hold 
him in esteem simply for think
ing, for having a mind and be
ing willing to use it.
As an institution of learn
ing, Carnegie Mellon Univer
sity has always respected 
ideas in this way, and this has 
been a defining part of its 
spirit and character.
CMU has always realized 
that in order for ideas to pros
per, ideas must be regarded 
as important  that people 
may disagree on which ideas 
are right and on which ideas 
are moral, but that they must 
always have the common 
ground of ideas as such.
The Fence itself, whose very 
purpose is none other than to 
broadcast messages to the en
tire campus, is a symbol of this.
Those who desecrated the 
Fence, however, rejected this 
premise. Their aim was not to 
promote their ideas, but to ridi
cule ours.
Nothing they left on the Fence 
supported any position; every

word was meant to distort what 
we had originally put there. 
They did not seek to claim the 
Fence for themselves, only to 
take it away from us.
This is not the method of the 
thinker, who seeks to defeat his 
opponents on intellectual 
grounds, by means of discourse 
and argument. This is the 
method of the child who fights 
his opponents with jeers and 
name-calling.
If those who disagreed with 
us had painted the entire Fence, 
replacing our words with praise 
for socialism or altruism or reli
gion or any other idea, they 
would have at least retained 
the dignity that belongs to those 
who think.
By using a constructive, in
tellectual method, instead of a 
destructive and anti-intellectual one, they would have left 
the way open for discussion, 
debate, and, eventually, intel
lectual progress. But by turn
ing the Fence into a mockery, 
they left only a sneer upon the 
campus and a bitter taste in 
everyones mouth.
The vandalization of the 
Fence shows a great disrespect 
for ideas. It betrays an intel
lectual nihilism whose only 
purpose is to destroy the ideas 
of others.
As such, it flies in the face of 
the spirit of the Fence and of 
this University.

Editor's Notebook
Couscous, lots and lots of 
couscous  thats what this 
years International Festival 
meant to me. At lunch time on 
Friday, I was able to walk into 
Rangos Hall and order a plate
ful of this delicious North Afri
can grain.
Anything which brings good 
food to campus is a treat. Yet 
an International Festival 
should mean a bit more than 
just an opportunity for an ex
otic lunch.
Well, I could have cut my 
classes on that Friday after
noon to go to an African drum
ming workshop. I could have 
skipped some homework the 
night before or any other 
evening that week to see any 
number of interesting-sound
ing speakers and films. I could 
have gone to several programs 
on Saturday if I didnt need 
that afternoon for work.
But thats precisely where the 
problem lies. The University 
expends so much time and ef
fort to give us all of these nifty 
cultural opportunities.
Yet, no one thought to lessen 
our academic burden for this 
week. Were left juggling typi
cally gargantuan workloads, 
with next to no time to take 
advantage of all of these great 
opportunities.
So many of these events were 
scheduled during weekday af
ternoons. I dont know about 
you, but Im pretty busy at
tending classes during those
times. How many students did 
they really expect to be able to 
attend a panel discussion on Eth
nic Gridlock and Politics in Af
rica in the oh-so-convenient time 
slot of 34 pm last Wednesday?
Even worse, the students who 
would make the effort to attend 
such programs are probably the 
ones whod be wracked with the 
most guilt if they cut class to do 
so. Its also pretty difficult to make
how beautifully it would solve 
the problem.
But Student Activities 
could realistically shift some 
of the events around, making 
it easier for students to actu
ally attend them.
For example, the Sunday of 
the International Festival 
this year didnt have much 
scheduledto occur. Next year, 
maybe more could happen on
",International Festival should 
mean a bit more than just an op
portunity for an exotic lunch. 
time to attend weekday evening 
programs, especially when 
crushed under the midsemester 
deluge of exams and assignments.
Obviously, all of the Interna
tional Festival events are forced 
to squeeze into a couple of days 
time. In order to fit them in, its 
understandable that some of 
them will have to take place 
during afternoon class time or 
busy evenings.
But these problems can be 
solved. Imagine a pristine, beau
tiful, class-free Friday. With this 
big fat chunk of time just waiting 
to be filled with activities, thered 
be no need to schedule events for 
Wednesday afternoon.
More importantly, students 
would have time to attend 
these activities without con
signing themselves to staying 
up until sunrise doing home
work while humming African 
tunes to themselves.
Okay, a three-day weekend for 
International Festival is probably 
not going to happen, no matter
Sunday and less could be 
stuffed into the week. That 
way, students could attend 
without needing to put classes 
or homework aside.
Or perhaps there could be a 
greater focus on activities 
such as exhibits that can re
main open throughout the 
week while people attend at 
their convenience.
It would be great if better 
scheduling permitted me to 
participate more in the Inter
national Festival when it fo
cuses on Europe next year. 
But, if nothing else, I know I 
can look forward to the chance 
to nibble on yummy French 
baguettes and Italian pasta.

Ifhe were still alive, French com
poser Georges Bizet would have 
celebrated his 159th birthday Sat
urday. Bizet composed the music 
for Carmen, whichis an opera about 
a love triangle and bullfighting. 
Its really macho and Ernest 
Hemingway would have loved it. 
One of Carmens songs is the 
March of the Toreadors. Its all 
aboutkillingbulls, see, and Torea
dor is Spanish for bullfighter.
If youve ever seen any of the 
Bad News Bears baseball mov
ies, youve heard this song. Its 
the one they play whenever they 
want to show a montage of the 
Bears letting grounders go be
tween their legs, watching the 
opponents home runs cruise over
the outfield fence, andrunninginto 
each other trying to catch pop-ups. 
Its a real comedy of errors.
If someone were to make a 
movie on the NFLs Chicago Bears 
this season, theyd probably put 
the song on repeat-play for these 
bad-news bears. And that goes 
double for the Indianapolis Colts. 
This week, both clubs marched 
into opponents stadiums 0-7 as 
sacrificial bulls to teams needing 
wins. The result?
The Colts got slammed 35-16 
as the Chargers scored the first 
19 points of the game, and the 
Bears received a one-day reprieve 
against the Dolphins because the 
World Series went into game 
seven in Miami. The Bears took a 
team without a single Pro-Bowler 
three years ago and won a playoff 
game before losing to the even
tual champion 49ers. Two sea
sons ago, the Colts were a play 
away from the SuperBowl. How 
did two teams fall so fast?
Chicago has horrible special 
teams and RB Marshall Faulk 
will be the first to tell you that 
Indys offensive line is the pits.
Both teams are in the bottom 
third in the league in first 
downs, TDs produced, and 
TDs allowed. Neither de
fense is bad, but they 
are not good either. The 
Colts ranked 12th in 
the league and Chi
cago 16th before the 
games. But whats 
the final answer?
Offense.
Indy is last in the
league, averag
ing just 258.9 
yards a game. 
Chicago isnt 
much better. 
They are 
283.7
per game is 
27th. (Its not 
but interesting
that the NFC West teams besides 
the San Francisco 49ers rank 
23rd, 26th, 28th, and 29th in total 
offense.) Its popular opinion 
in every sport that defense 
wins games. But its just as 
true that offense loses them. 
The only question is why 
do the teams offenses suck? 
Although its true the Bears 
have limped through the sea
son with injuries to their 
young talent (WR Curtis 
Conway and RB Rashan Sa
laam), they shot themselves 
in the foot by creating a quarter
back controversy. In the off-season, the team traded the tenth 
overall pick 
in the draft 
for the much-maligned 
Rick Mirer. This was 
foolhardy, not because the
gamble on Mirer Tom Blrdsey/Tartan Art Staff ,, ihasnt panned out,
not because the past draft was so
deep, but because they already
had a franchise play-caller in
Erik Kramer.
Kramer had a career year two
seasons ago and is another Bear
trying to get untracked after a 
serious injury. If there ever was a 
bad time to bring a new leader 
(Mirer) to a team, the Bears ad
ministration picked it.
Both teams are now firmly en
trenched in the race to draft Uni

luck. Theyve lost free agents 
(most notably Ashley Ambrose), 
had players retire (including early 
retiree, former #4 pick Trev 
Alberts), and their Pro-Bowlers

these teams finish 0-16? No ones 
ever done it.
Chicagos best hopes for a win 
come in week 14 and 15 when 
they entertain the hard-luck Buf
falo Bills and travel to St. Louis 
to play the Rams. Theyve been 
close to wins the past two weeks 
though, losing by a field goal to 
New Orleans Saints and a point 
to the defending SuperBowl 
Champion Green Bay Packers.
The Colts, on the other hand, 
have simply found a streak of bad
combined 17 points.
Indys best chance to get a win 
comes in two weeks when the 
Cincinatti Bengals come to town. 
Besides that game, the Colts dont 
face another team that currently 
has a losing record. Four of their 
last five games are also on the 
road. Somebody give this team

dominant squad at the time. Former 
CMU player Billy Sofa is now the dean of 
engineering at Pitt.
He was [onlyl about 5'9", but he could 
shoot, said OBrien.
OBrien has taught at Point Park, 
RMC, and Pitt and was once offered a 
teaching postion at CMU. He credits 
CMU English professor Lois Fowler as 
being the first person to take an interest 
in his writing. Fowler was his 11th grade 
English teacher at Taylor Allderdice 
High School.
One day, I turned in a paper, and she 
questioned its veracity, said OBrien. 
After reading an in-class paper of his, 
Fowler introduced him to liberal-arts 
oriented people in high school.
She lifted me to a different level, said
OBrien. She secretly gave him a copy of 
The Catcher in the Rye, which was a 
controversial book at the time. The books 
content was hidden from students.
That tells you what the times were 
like then, said OBrien. At that par
ticular time I thought it was the autobi
ography of Yogi Berra.
His best selling book, Pittsburgh: The 
Story of the City of Champions, has sold 
37,500 copies. He has published a book 
in each of the last seven years.
Ive sort of fixed it on nine months 
because its like having a baby. At least 
its the closest that Ill ever come.
His next book, We Had Em All the Way: 
Bob Prince and his Pittsburgh Pirates, 
details the life of Prince, a Pirates sportscaster from 1947 to 1975. OBrien was 
given the Bob Prince Memorial Award
this year. As he had done before, OBrien 
kept returning to the topic of college.
I think college was the greatest, and I 
still enjoy being on campus, he said. I 
would bet that students in the 20s were 
involved in far more student activities, 
said OBrien, in reference to the 1922 
Thistle. Today we have so many students 
who come to school and they dont get 
connected with anything. They get con
nected with the computer.
CMU was the first of four stops for 
OBrien Saturday. He was later scheduled 
to give a talk on his interests and appear 
at two local malls for additional book 
signings. He fondly recalled a recent trip 
to a middle school.
They paid me the greatest compliment 
Ive ever had, OBrien said.  You are 
what we call a life-long learner .

TOURNEY, from page 14
they would give up, but that they didnt 
believe that they could win  and with 
any mind game, you need to think that 
you can win, even if the opponents are 6 
feet tall and All-Americans.
We can make one mistake and think 
to ourselves that its almost expected 
of us instead of getting angry and not 
making the mistake again, said 
Kinsey about the struggles of the 
young team. But we have come a long 
way this season and I think that we 
will continue to improve over the next 
few years.
But after Wednesdays loss, Webb said 
that they still expected to win the tour
nament at LaRoche on Saturday, and 
her prediction was money when CMU 
proved that they could overcome their 
demons and won the entire tournament 
in four straight matches.
It was a battle, said Webb. The first 
showdown was against Waynesburg; 
CMU took the games in three sets 15-6, 
16-14,15-10, battling back from a defi
cit in the second game which was some
thing that the team had struggled with 
all year.
Next, CMU faced Pitt-Greensburg, also 
taking that match, killing them 15-2, 
15-8. 15-9. Spurred on by the win, the 
moved to trounce the host team LaRoche 
15-10, 15-3, 15-7.
After some difficulties with other 
teams and waiting four hours before 
the other finalist team was decided, 
CMU was pitted against Pitt-Bradford, 
a bigger team with stronger hitters, 
and more of them. CMU lost the first 
game 7-15, then slapped them right 
back 15-7, lost the third set 13-15 and 
then blew Pitt-Bradford away 152 in 
the fourth game.
The all-tournament team had been 
announced before the final match and 
two Tartans  including stellar sopho
more Steph Szobota, a middle hitter  
were included on the roster. A PittBradford player was named MVP, but 
when Szobota stuffed her for game point 
of the final match  which CMU won 
15-13  it was very clear to Webb who 
the MVP should have been.
Our confidence was through the roof; 
I was really proud of my girls, said 
Webb whose squad faces'Washington 
University and New York University to 
start off the UAA tournament starting 
next Friday. We were louder yesterday 
than we have been all year, and we 
never gave up.
It was so awesome. We did so many 
good things that weve been working 
hard on. We were intense, we were physi
cal and we pushed it out, said Webb, 
who also cited Sekowski for continuing 
her outstanding play at this tourna
ment where everyone contributed to 
pushing the team hitting and defensive 
numbers to new heights.
CMUs final regular season record is
8-22, but all eight wins have come in 
their last 12 games. The team will be 
watching NYU game tapes this week in 
preparation for this upcoming final week
end of play at UAAs. We are so psyched 
to beat NYU, said Webb.
The Tartans have finished their regu
lar season.
SINKS, from page 14
in the nation. A win would bring atten
tion and respect to CMU.
The game started off evenly. CMU 
and Rochester battled for control of 
the ball and offensive opportunities. 
After the first 10 minutes, Rochester 
seemed to gain more control of the 
ball. CMU had not managed to get a 
shot on goal, and now Rochester was 
using its speed on offense to create 
opportunities.
With 32 minutes left in the first half, 
Rochester got its first very good opportu
nity to score when a fast break lead to a 
break away for a Rochester player. The 
Tartan goalie, sophomore Ben Kartzman, 
was able to give the player only a small 
amount of space to shoot at and easily 
made the save on the shot.
Less than four minutes later, how
ever, Rochester was able to score. CMU 
gave up a free kick 35 yards out on the 
right side of their own goal. As CMU 
was setting up its wall of defenders in 
front of the ball, a Rochester player 
took a quick shot. Kartzman was 
caught unprepared, and the ball 
skipped quickly on the wet turf just 
inside the left goal post to give Roches
ter the lead.
CMU did not give up and immedi
ately began to put offensive pressure 
on Rochester. The Tartans missed few
good scoring opportunities with 23 
minutes left in the half when senior 
Jason Beulow got a low, hard shot on 
net and, ten minutes later, a shot off a 
corner kick rebound was barely saved 
by the Rochester goalie.
Finally, with eight minutes left, 
CMU tied the game. Beulow carried 
the ball down the right side of the 
field until he crossed the ball in. Fresh
man David Zupon was able to get a 
shot on goal that beat the Rochester 
goalie to the lower left-hand side of 
the goal.
The second half started quickly for 
both teams. Only three minutes into 
the half, Rochester went ahead by a 
goal again. CMU didnt cave in, though, 
and six minutes later, junior Harry 
Ulrich scored to tie the game. Beulow 
won the ball at near mid-field and led 
a two-on-one break with Ulrich. 
Beulow brought the ball in and then 
passed off to Ulrich, who touched the 
ball once and shot the ball just past the 
Rochester goalie.
The tie was short-lived, however. 
With 20 minutes left in the half Roch
ester scored for the final time in the 
game. CMU lost some of its wind after 
that. Although Kartzman came up with 
some more spectacular saves and the 
offense managed to get a few more 
shots, they were unable to score again.

for two extra points, and failed.
The Tartans scored in six plays, 
one of which was a 20-yard pass to 
LH Brian Krueger on fourth and

attempts. TE Chris Barnicle re
ceived four receptions for 55 yards, 
while Krueger, Neupaver, and 
Campie rushed for a combined 
163 yards and three touchdowns.
After the dramatic comeback, 
which primarily used passing 
plays, does Clay have anything to 
say to the Playa Haters who think 
he cannot pass?
No, I just let my play prove 
myself, Clay said. I will do what

During the last week of regular sea
son play, CMU womens volleyball 
stormed towards the upcoming finals. 
Despite a loss to College of Wooster, 
they will sail into the UAA tourna
ment next weekend in New York City 
coming off winning four straight 
matches in a weekend tourney at 
LaRoche College.
Playing their last home game in 
Skibo Gymnasium against Wooster, 
the team didnt want to go out without
The team had been working on de
fense all week at practice and it paid 
off. It took a lot of heart to step up to 
the challenge, and not give up on the 
drills, but that kind of intensity is 
what were striving for in the games, 
said freshman Cindy Kos, a middle 
hitter. Sophomore setter Sarah Putaro 
had 20 digs for the match and Rinsey 
had 16 in what Webb called incred
ible defense.
Ending the drills is like getting to 
15 first, you give an all-out effort 
throughout, and are all the more proud 
when you finish, said Kos.
In the fourth set, CMU came close,
We have come a long way this season and 
I think that we will continue to improve.

another point in the standings. They 
dropped the first game, scoring only 
five points. The second game was also 
a struggle but the team managed to 
score nine, and really came to life 
towards the end of it.;
Coach Julie Webb made a change in 
the third game, taking out senior Brit
tany Rutter, co-captain and outside 
hitter, and replacing her with fellow 
captain, junior Jennifer Sutherland.
Jenn played well, she came in and 
slammed a couple of hits and really 
picked up the momentum for us, said 
Ashley Kinsey, sophomore and out
side hitter. The Tartans took that game 
15-13.
but Woosters defense was excellent 
too, and the Tartans lost, 11-15. None
theless, sophomore Beth Sekowski had 
a career high of 16 kills, averaging 
four per game as the team posted their 
highest dig rate of the year, 19.25 per 
game. Considering that in the first 
game of the match they only managed 
11 digs, they really picked it up over 
the next three matches, scoring 66 
more.
Like any other sport, volleyball is a 
mind game. Many times this year, the 
CMU women would get behind early 
in a game and the momentum would 
drain out of their bodies. It wasnt that

Upset-minded Tartans play highly ranked Rochester
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Sports Editor
CMUs womens soccer team took an
other step up on the ladder to success 
Friday night in a rain-saturated battle 
with #3 Rochester. The Tartans entered 
the contest emphasizing their sound 
defense, as the team had only allpwed 
two goals in the past four games. One 
of those games was a 1-0 upset win 
over then-ranked #9 Gettysburg, on 
October 11.
Everyone was playing to their fullest 
potential, senior Mary Wall said of the 
Gettysburg game.
, We knew how they played and had a 
game plan for the way they attack, said 
head coach Ann Haggerty. I dont think 
Gettysburg was ready for that.
But Rochester fielded a stronger 
squad and surely wouldnt come to CMU 
unprepared, especially after the 
Gettsyburg upset.
They were excellent, Frank Sum
mers said of the Rochester team. Sum
mers is the president of a graphics com
pany in New Hampshire, a youth soccer 
coach, and the father of freshman Alex 
Summers, a backup goalkeeper. [Their] 
trapping and passing was overwhelm
ing. But the CMU girls, they played 
hard, they played well, he said.
They were fast, said Stephany Sum
mers of the opponents forwards. Mrs. 
Summers was in town for Family Week
end with her husband and other daugh
ter, Sarah.
We did a good job defending them. We 
had to play very defensively, said 
Haggerty. CMU was indeed forced to 
play defensively all night. They were 
outshot 15-2 and lost 3-0 to Rochester.
Lindsay Smith has had a great

year, Haggerty said of CMUs goal
keeper. Smith, a junior, had 12 saves 
Friday; most of them sliding stops on 
the wet turf.
Our goalie had a great game, sopho
more Romy Fischbr agreed.
Rochesters three scores were a combi
nation of skill and luck. On the only goal 
of the first half, a Rochester forward 
rocketed a shot on goal from 35 yards 
out. A little to the left and the ball would 
have been wide, a little to the right and 
Smith would have made another save. 
Instead, the ball hit the left post and 
bounced directly to another Rochester 
forward. She controlled the bounce and 
booted it to the back of the net.
That comer was just awesome, said 
sophomore Jocelyn Pollack, recalling 
Rochesters second goal. A Rochester 
comer kick floated up in front of CMUs 
goal and was headed in by a big Roches
ter forward, who could simply jump 
higher than the Tartan defenders.
The third goal was just as perfectly 
executed. With a CMU defender on her 
back, one of Rochesters quick forwards 
deflected a deep centering pass on the 
fly. Smith could only watch the ball skip 
to the left side of the goal.
Except for a brief calm in the second 
half, the entire game was played during 
the rain.

Our beloved Tartans traveled to Chi
cago last Saturday to meet the Maroons 
of Chicago. Coming into the game, the 
Tartans had never lost to Chicago, win
ning by an average of 31 points. This 
game extended the streak as the Tar
tans came from behind to beat the Ma
roons in overtime, 35-34.
The Tartans gained first possession of 
the ball, and they were poised'to attack 
from their 11-yard line. Chicago, not 
wanting to lose their homecoming game, 
also came out with a vengeance. On the 
second play of the game, QB Russ Clay 
fumbled the ball and Chicago recovered. 
Three plays later, Chicago QB James 
Judd rushed six yards for a TD. The 
extra point was blocked, and the score
was 6^0 Miaroons.
The Tartan offense was struggling 
against the Chicago defense and was 
forced to punt away their next two pos
sessions. The second punt was a disaster 
as punter Ray Crux punted the ball for 
only 14 yards. Chicago received the kick 
at CMUs 23-yard line and looked ready 
to add another TD to the score. On their 
first play of the drive, Chicago RB Way 
rushed 18 yards to the Tartans 5 yard 
line. However, the defensive line of the 
Tartans would not bulge as the Maroons 
tried to rush in for the touchdown, twice. 
On fourth down, the Maroons kicked an
18 yard field goal that put them up,.9-0.
The Tartans, fortunate to be down by 
only nine, needed to gain control of the 
game. They were not playing the way 
conference leaders play; this was not the 
way teams played under Coach Lackner.
Evidently, the team was not as inspired 
as this writer. On the first play of the 
drive SE Rick Steiner fumbled the ball 
on the Tartans 21-yard line, only to 
have it recovered by the Maroons. The 
defense of the Tartans did its best imita
tion of the U.S. Government handing
The Tartans converted two third downs 
on the drive. One was a 35-yard pass to 
Barnicle that put the Tartans deep into 
Chicago territory, the second was a TD 
run by RB Mike Campie. The drive went 
95 yards in 15 plays. After, the extra 
point, the Tartans only trailed, 9-7.
I will do whatever it takes for my team to 
win. Whatever it takes. 
 Russ Clay, sophomore quarterback
out welfare cheese, as they got stingy 
and refused to allow the first down to 
Chicago.
The offense of CMU, taking a cue from 
the D, came out tough. On their second 
possession of the second quarter, the 
Tartans came out with nothing to lose.
The defense of the Tartans treated the 
Maroons like rag dolls again, and re
fused to give up any yardage. On the 
third play of the drive Chris Schmitt 
intercepted a Maroons pass, and the 
Tartans were rolling on the river.
It only took the Tartans six plays and
36 yards to score another touchdown. 
The touchdown came off of a 5-yard run 
by RH Chris Neupaver. After the failed 
extra point, CMU was ahead, 13-9.
The Maroons, however, would not go 
down without a fight. With 1:32 left 
until half-time, the Maroons fought back 
like Marv Albert will in jail, as they 
drove 68 yards in six plays for another 
touchdown. The Maroons went into halftime up 16-13.
The second half saw a complete rever
sal of what had occurred. The Maroons 
took advantage of the Tartans, like Presi
dentClinton does to his secretaries,  
they scored two touchdowns and went 
up 28-13, to end the third quarter.
But the Tartans were about to come 
back like Jason in Friday the 13th. They 
began the fourth quarter extending their

My books arent really about 
sports. Thats the lure. Theyre 
really about life; about people, 
said author Jim OBrien, who 
made his third trip to the Univer
sity Shoppe Saturday morning. 
People have always been much 
more fascinating to me than 
games. OBrien grew up in 
nearby Hazelwood and has writ
ten nine books about Pittsburghs 
professional sports teams.
Its always exciting to learn 
new things, said OBrien, who 
learned that Honus Wagner was 
the baseball coach at CIT after 
seeing a copy of the 1922 Thistle.
I was sort of a street-student, 
he said, remarking that he spent 
time at Frankie Gustines (who 
played for the Pirates), a bar in 
Oakland thats now called 
Hemingways. I wasnt always 
in class, but I was learning.
I signed up for The Pitt News 
before I signed up for classes, 
said OBrien, who did a large part 
of his learning working at vari
ous sources. He worked for Pitts 
biweekly paper, the yearbook, and 
the radio station. OBrien bought 
a toy printing press at the age of 
9, and was the sports editor of a 
local newspaper in high school 
before becoming Pitt sports edi
tor.
At the time, the position was 
reserved for seniors and carried a 
scholarship that covered half of 
tuition. Murray Chass, who now 
covers baseball for the New York 
Times, nominated him for the job 
as a sophomore.
Everybody at Oakland bars 
assumed I was a senior, so I was 
able to drink at an earlier age, 
said OBrien.
While in the army, he was sent 
to Alaska to be an assistant edi
tor of a 12-page paper.
Two weeks later I was the edi
tor, said OBrien, who said the 
paper actually printed twice as 
many pages. Unlike his Pitt job, 
the Alaskan paper carried no ex
tra frills. I got paid as much as 
the guys who paraded and did 
push-ups. But OBrien recalls 
his college days most vividly.
When I was a student, every
thing happened in Oakland, he 
said, noting that the Steelers and 
Pirates both played at Forbes 
Field. He enrolled at Pitt in Sep
tember of1960. One month later 
the Yankees were in town for the 
World Series, said OBrien. Oak
land was kind of an oasis. Ac
cording to OBrien, a nature mu
seum was once across from Phipps 
Conservatory, and museums 
were free of charge. He recalls 
visiting CMU to see the Tartans 
basketball team, which was a

first-time organizer of CMUs annual 
International Festival. Let the Festheir families, said Midkiff.
According to Justin Mingo, a junior

member of the International Festival 
committee, variety was key to the com
mittee as they tried to have as many
events as possible to give people what 
they wanted while still keeping with the 
theme of Africa.
I guess it depends on what youre 
interested in. If you are interested in 
music, you should go to the drum work
shop.... We had some lectures to give 
an idea of life over there and the

I would say that for each festival

JOURNEYS' OPEN STUDENTS' EYES
By NEEMA AVASHIA
Tartan Staffivriter
Everyone journeys through life 
on their own path. No matter the 
manner of embarking on these 
journeys, everyones experience is 
a life story. Through the sharing 
of these journeys, we can learn 
about each other and ourselves. 
The Personal Journeys series that
took place this past weekend is 
the perfect example of this, since 
so many were willing to share 
their lives in order to open the 
Grinds of others to countries and 
cultures they have had little expo
sure to in the past.
The Personal Journeys series 
that took place last Wednesday
through Saturday, was an inte
gral part of the International 
Festival this year. The purpose 
of the Personal Journeys series is 
to be able to broaden the focus of 
the' International Festival, and 
to introduce people to more spe
cific topics in smaller groups, 
said Linda Melville, foreign stu
dent advisor and organizer of 
Personal Journeys.
Personal Journeys presenta
tions took place every afternoon 
with the topics ranging from Eth
nic Gridlock and Politics in Af
rica to Senegalese Dance: An 
Introduction for Beginners. The 
styles of the Personal Journeys 
also varied greatly, with some 
panel discussions, some lectures,
and some slide shows. Present
ers included students, profes
sors, and members of the local 
community.
We were trying to get a 
variety of different cultures 
and places in Africa repre
sented, said Melville. In ad
dition, this year CMU was 
honored by the presence of 
Hassan Adamu, Ambassador 
to the U.S. for Nigeria, who 
spoke on Transition to Civil
ian Rule in Nigeria.
Several African countries, in
cluding Ghana, Uganda, Nige
ria, Kenya, South Africa, and 
Egypt, were represented 
through the Personal Journeys 
series. At the Carnegie Mellon 
Action Project (CMAP) Student 
Panel titled Unraveling the 
Myth of Africa, students from 
Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and 
South Africa spoke about vari
ous aspects of their respective 
cultures, of their experiences 
in Africa, and about their lives 
in the United States.
Growing up, the three of us 
[siblings] had a lot of conflicts 
about what was right and 
wrong, said Kodwo Dadzie, a 
junior mechanical engineering 
major whose father is from 
Ghana and whose mother is an 
African-American. He discussed

Highland Park Clean Up was another

but it was canceled due to the weather.
We didnt get the volunteers we

cooperated and the trip was canceled, 
said Brann. She added that the event 
will probably not be rescheduled since 
the weather will be getting worse as 
winter approaches.
With the trip to Highland Park can

to the ARL, which houses stray and 
abandoned animals while preparing 
them for adoption.

Frew and Brann both stressed love of 
animals as a major reason why volunteers 
went to the ARL. Brann said that many of 
the volunteers had animals at home which 
they missed deeply and the ARL service trip 
was a good way for them to get to play with 
animals and remember their pets at home.

group made some particular friends, said 
Brann. [There] was a giant Irish Setter 
named Rusty who liked to shake hands 
and cuddle. Another favorite was a quiet 
dog named Duchess who stuck close to 
her volunteer ... for most of the time. 
Besides getting the dogs out of their 
cages and giving them attention, the 
volunteers got to make comments on the
individual dogs in an effort to give the 
prospective owners some background on 
each dogs personality. Brann said that 
all the volunteers hope the dogs find 
suitable, loving homes soon.
Another nice thing about SDC goingto 
the ARL collectively is that now indi
vidual volunteers from that group can 
go on their own initiative, since they 
have completed the training.
After we [took] all of the dogs out, 
we sat back and relaxed over Subway 
lunches provided by SDC. Everyone 
was bursting with excitement and sto
ries about the animals we worked 
with, said Brann.
Before I left, I talked to the orga
nizer because I plan on going back, 
said Frew.
The event was so popular that Brann 
has decided to begin a monthly trip to 
the ARL. If students arent comfortable 
going alone, the next opportunity to vol

The session is geared toward those

full-time or internship position at 
the firm.
Now that its getting colder, it's the 
opportune time to start staying indoors. 
If you're on campus, this may mean 
spending more time in the University 
Center, and if this is the case, you might 
want to start visiting the University Cen
ter Art Gallery. Featured there as part of 
the International Festival: Africa 97 is 
artist Saihou Njie.
Originally from Gambia, Njie moved 
to Pittsburgh in 1985 because his wife 
is a Homestead native. Njie has trav
eled extensively as an artist, dancer, 
and photographer. His current exhibi
tion in the UC Art Gallery is entitled 
Lifes Dreams and features his origi
nal display of innovative African ba
tik pieces.
The way he approaches his art seems to 
be the same way he approaches his life  
as an amalgam of different media which 
combine to produce a piece of work fol
lowing in the steps of tradition but forg
ing a new path.
The Tartan: Could you tell me about 
your experiences as a dancer and artist?
Saihou Njie: I went to school in up
state New York and studied Fine Arts. I 
was exposed to art and artists; Ive al
ways been interested in dance, and in 
my travels I ended up in Boston where I 
met a group that did very good African 
dance. I joined them and traveled with 
them for three years.
From that experience, I traveled to 
Europe and ended up in Scandinavia, 
in Sweden. There I landed a job doing 
dance. The Swedish government had 
some philanthropic projects going on 
in my native country, Gambia, and 
they wanted me to help them raise 
money for their projects, so I put on my 
hat as a dancer and percussionist and 
travelled to 98 Swedish cities. It was a 
great experience.
From there I went back to Africa, to 
Gambia. There I founded the Youth 
Fund Against Drugs and Alcohol. The 
organization is still thriving even 
though it took me several years to get it 
off the ground.
TT: What do you think of CMUs Inter
national Festival: Africa 97?
>S7'/: I think its agreatidea. Itexposesthe
students to whats in the rest of the world. 
I feel good that I can participate in it and I 
hope I can do the same next time around.
TT: Have you had much experience 
with CMU?
SN: I used to frequent the art supply 
store. Ever since they tore down [Skibo], 
I havent been [to CMU] much. Now 
its so busy and big! The other day I 
came to drop off my artwork, and it 
took the guard one minute to turn 
around and give me a ticket! But we 
worked it out. The Student Life Office 
made arrangements for me to stay 
parked where I was.
CMU is a great school and Ive been 
looking at continuing my education
there. Ive become very interested in 
architecture. Maybe I can arrange an 
exchange  I can teach my art and take 
classes. Well see what happens.
TT: How does the way you create batik 
differ from the original practice? Why do 
you do it differently?
SN: I do it differently because batik
 even though its a very old art form
 you have the same look. It doesnt 
matter where the piece is from, as 
long as its batik, you can tell its 
batik. With all batik, you dip the fab
ric into a dye bath which gives it a 
uniform color. This makes it very flat; 
there is no movement. Its very rigid 
and structured.
My style, I apply my colors with a 
brush before dipping, just like watercolor. So you can actually see 
brushstrokes of color. A lot of people, 
when they come very close [to the piece], 
they think Oh, its watercolor. But 
when they come even closer and they see 
its on fabric, they say, Oh, its on fabric! 
Oh, its batik!
TT: Why is it important that your work 
be different from other batik artists?
SN: In the art world, there are so 
many of us [artists]. Its important that 
we stand out. If we have a style, we can 
stand out, someone can recognize [a par
ticular artist].
I feel blessed that my style of vvork is 
not realism but is in between realism 
and fact. In each and every last piece 
there are so many stories and ideas 
going on. Every day you look at the piece 
there are more things going on. What 
you see depends on your experience as 
an observer.
For example, say there is a person in 
an art gallery. His back is to you and all 
you can see are his shoulders shaking. 
What do you interpret that as? Well, it 
depends on where you come from. Say 
you come from a funeral home, you may 
interpret his shaking as weeping. But if 
you come from a party with your friends, 
you might think hes laughing. It all 
depends on where you come from.
TT: What is the one thing you would 
want someone looking at your art to 
come away feeling?
SN: Happy. Because of the color, the 
harmony, the movement, the energy. 
There are a lot of professionals, doctors 
especially, who buy my work. I dont 
know why, but every time they buy a 
piece, I can tell in their face that its like 
a candy lover buying a box of candy  
they cant wait to get home, open the 
package, and start getting down. I can 
see these people rushing out of my 
workspace and rushing home to open 
the work and hang it up.
I feel that even though I may want to 
be many different things  an architect, 
a doctor  I cannot. I am an artist. But 
if a doctor goes home and my work in
spires him to do what' he does, I have 
become a part of that person.
Chris Cannon/Tartan Sports Editor
Njie finds happiness in the fact that he can be a part of others lives by inspiring them.

We are concerned about our 
health. We are concerned about 
trees. If you want to take our oil, you 
should not also take our health and 
our environment.
This was Dr. Owen Wiwas mes
sage to Shell Oil Company on behalf 
of Nigerias Ogoni people as he ex
pressed it to an audience 
in Rangos Hall last 
Thursday evening.
Dr. Wiwa, brother of 
the late Nigerian writer 
and activist Ken SaroWiwa, is a physician and 
human rights activist 
from Ogoniland.
We brought Owen 
Wiwa here to heighten 
awareness of environ
mental racism and the 
plight of the Ogoni 
people of Nigeria. Speak
ers like Wiwa are impor
tant because they expose 
the student body to is
sues beyond Pittsburgh 
and beyond the U.S., 
said Melissa Chan, a jun
ior chemical engineering 
maj or and member of the 
AB political speakers 
committee.
Before Wiwa even spoke a word, 
the audience viewed the atrocities 
against the Ogoni people through 
Delta Force, a video composed pri
marily of footage smuggled out of 
Nigeria. The introduction to the 
video featured Saro-Wiwas son 
speaking about his father.
My fathers only crime has been 
to organize a successful and non
violent struggle against the exploi
tation of the Nigerian people and 
their land by the Shell Oil company 
and the Nigerian government, said 
Saro-Wiwas son.
Ken Saro-Wiwa led the Movement 
for the Survival of Ogoni People 
(MSOP), a grassroots group, now 
consisting of 2000 members, which 
was organized to highlight the
plight of the Ogoni people. The 
Ogoni people contend that Shell 
Oil has not consulted or compen
sated them for the environmental 
damage they have done to the oncefertile Ogoniland. The video showed 
a farmer standing next to a rup
tured gas line spilling onto his 
fields. According to the video, there 
are approximately four oil spills 
per week in Ogoniland, most due to

equipment failure or corrosion.
There was a time in my home 
when we didnt have water to drink 
because most of the rivers were pol
luted because of leakage from oil 
fields. So, we looked up to God and 
the rain came. But the rain was also 
black from the gas lines from the oil 
fields. There was a time when even 
drinking water was a luxury, said 
Wiwa after the video.
The response of the Nigerian gov
ernment to MSOPs protests has 
been quick and brutal. Ogoniland is 
now sealed off and under martial 
law. Recent attacks scattered across 
10 villages resulted in 750 deaths 
and left 30,000 homeless. The video 
featured graphic depiction of the

who are actually from a feminist club at

over the PA, which set a tone for the 
night. During the march, several people 
earned signs bearing messages like Hey 
hey mister keep your hands off my sis

Passers-by had mixed reactions as they 
witnessed the march push on through 
the rain. Some cheered as they walked 
by or honked their horns and waved, 
while one man in his car stuck his downturned thumb out the window.

By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
Last Friday, despite the rain and cold, 
a group of women marched down Forbes 
Avenue, chanting: Were women! Were 
here! Were fabulous, dont fuck with 
us! They yelled atthe top oftheir lungs, 
fists raised, taking over the whole side
walk. Even though many of these women 
had never met each other, they were 
drawn together under one common pur
pose, which was clear by listening to 
their chants. What do we want? Safe 
streets! When do we 
want em? NOW!
This group, which is 
not actually comprised 
of all women (there are 
men, but you could 
count them on one 
hand out of a group of 
150), is raising aware
ness of violence 
against women, 
through the annual 
Take Back the Night 
rally. The goal is to cre
ate an environment 
where women do not 
have to live in fear in 
of violence, and where 
survivors of past vio
lence can feel sup
ported. Both survivors 
of rape and supportersof rape survivors at*-as* Friday, victims of sexual violence and their supporters took back the night.
tended the march and vigil.
Before the march, the group, made up 
mostly of students from CMU, Pitt, and 
Chatham, met in Doherty Hall 2210, 
where Patrice Walters of Pittsburgh 
Action Against Rape (PAAR) spoke 
briefly on rape. Walters works with rape 
victims and survivors, which means 
anyone at any stage of recovery from an 
act of violence.
People ask me if I like my job, said 
Walters. I say, Sure. But really, Id 
prefer not to have to do it. But the reality 
is that its not going to happen in my 
lifetime, or in your lifetime, but I have a 
six-year old daughter, and shell have a 
daughter who wont know the meaning 
of sexual violence, and I want to thank 
you for being the first step in making 
that happen.
On the outside, this rally appeared 
aggressive, radically feminist. Before the 
program got underway, the organizers,
William Pitt Union, the aggressive
ness subsided into empowerment, as 
a candlelight vigil was held in sup
port of survivors.
For victims, one of the first steps to 
recovery is to tell and re-tell their sto
ries. And the stories told at the rally 
were powerful and difficult to hear. 
Walters said that alcohol and drugs are 
the biggest connection to sexual vio
lence, and many of the stories related to 
times when the victim, or the perpetra
tor, was drunk or high.
Rebecca, a CMU freshman who wanted 
her real name withheld, told of how she 
was raped twice at age 13 when she was 
drunk and blocked it out until she came 
to college. She told her story at the rally 
without flinching and with barely any 
sign of emotion.
Other stories, like Katherines, made 
it clear why Rebecca wanted her name 
concealed. She told of two instances of
violence, once in her own neighborhood, 
when two men chased her in a truck 
until she climbed a tree to escape. And 
another time, when she was raped at a 
party by someone who she thought was 
her friend.
Theyll call you liar, slut, cunt, 
bitch,  Katherine said. They told me 
because I was drunk that it wouldnt be 
wise to press charges.
As the vigil progressed, the stories the 
survivors told became more emotionallycharged, and the night took on the pur
pose of more than just awareness  it 
allowed people to 
take steps toward recovery. Another 
young woman said 
that it was the first 
time shed spoken 
about her experience 
of abuse since she 
was seven years old, 
when she was 
pushed away by 
unsupportive family.
Even though the 
rally started on the 
CMU campus, only 
a handful of the 
group actually were 
CMU students.
I think its be
cause this campus is 
so fucking apa
thetic, said Emily 
Gustabsen, a sopho
more design major. I think the event 
could have been publicized better, but I 
think people just didnt care.
Its ironic that Im asked [about why 
Im here], said Jay Woodward, a junior 
computer science major, one of the few 
CMU men present at the rally. I actu
ally support this cause, yet you ask me 
why. Its like I cant be supportive. Its an 
issue that everyone should support. 
Everybodys hurt if a woman is hurt. 
Sexual violence stops love from work
ing. Thats why Im here.
One of the leaders from Chatham 
summed up the night with her com
ments, as she abandoned the micro
phone and shouted to the crowd. 
Within us is the power to do what
ever we want. Find that light like 
those candles, take that control. Some 
people dont know the power that they 
have  believe in yourself, no ones 
going to do it for you.

The Ballet Ngoma is an African

The personal journeys are lec

environment and explained the 
benefits and detractions of his liv
ing situation. I found the entire 
situation helped me learn how to 
deal with people, and to under
stand that there are good things 
and bad things about everything.
Other items discussed by pan
elists included race and ethnicity 
in Uganda, growing up in South 
Africa, dispelling myths about 
what people think of Africa ver
sus what it is really like, and the 
experience of returning to ones 
native country for the first time.
Other talks included one by Dr. 
Vincent Sinabulya, a Pitt gradu
ate student, who spoke about the 
experiences of women in Uganda. 
Sinabulya described many of the 
hardshipswhichwomeninUganda 
face, from hard labor to widespread 
occurrences of sexually transmit
ted diseases. Women process the 
coffee from the growing point to 
the selling point, but at the selling 
point, the man takes over, said 
Sinabulya. The money goes in the 
mans pocket.
Sinabulya gave an in-depth 
description of the problems that 
are arising due to an outbreak 
of AIDS among the women of 
Uganda. He explained that af
ter Idi Amin was overthrown, 
Amins men went all over the 
country raping women, thus 
making Uganda a country with 
numerous AIDS cases, of which 
most are women. However, 
Sinabulya also pointed out that 
Uganda is ranked second after 
the United States in the fight 
against AIDS. In addition, 
Sinabulya discussed the recent 
move to power that women have 
taken, becoming more involved 
in government, and taking a 
stronger stand on issues impor
tant to them. You can convince 
a man to be corrupt very easily, 
but you cant convince a woman 
to be corrupt so easily. 
[Sinabulyas lecture] gave an 
insight into how women in other 
countries strive to gain freedom, 
said Ridzwan Nordin, a sopho
more information and decision 
systems major.

Some of the Personal Journeys were comprised of student panels.
Students at the Personal Jour
neys lectures left with their eyes 
opened to new aspects of culture, 
and new ideas about countries 
that they might have never 
thought of before. It was inter
esting, because living in the U.S. 
we arent exposed to anything 
like this, said Nordin.
The Personal Journeys series 
served as a way for people to learn
about Africa in a more casual set
ting, making the experience ex
tremely interactive. Theyre re
ally interesting. I know nothing 
about Africa, but after [one of the 
Personal Journeys], I felt like I 
knew at least a little bit, said 
Heidi Adick, a junior majoring in 
psychology and German. These 
things only happen once in a while, 
but they can be really cool.

While there is drilling in other parts

severe in Ogoniland because the land is

make a barrel of oil in Ogoni com
pared to about 10 dollars in the 
United States. Wiwa attributes the 
seven dollar difference to environ
mental and human-rights debts 
placed upon his people.
About 55 percent of the oil Shell 
produces in Ogoni is exported to the 
United States. Wiwa urged the au
dience to write to their congress 
members in support of an embargo 
on Nigerian oil now being consid
ered in Congress. Wiwa also urged 
consumers to write or send the post
cards that were distributed before 
his talk to President Clinton and 
the CEO of Shell Oil.
We ask consumers to think about 
this oil you are using. People are lulled, 
women are raped before it comes here 
[to the U.S.]. We arent asking for 
moneywe are asking you to write to 
Shell. As long as you go on using that 
oil, they will think everything is okay,

Food, money, and a pat on the back. 
Family Weekend seemed to be the 
perfect opportunity for students to 
refuel themselves for the second half 
of the semester. Many students took 
advantage of the University-sponsored events while others just spent 
quality time with their families. Re
gardless of which ac
tivities they partici
pated in, the week
end left students feel
ing a little fatter, a 
few pennies richer, 
and proud to be CMU 
students.
The weekend is an 
important time for 
students, family mem
bers, faculty, and staff 
'to join together to 
share information and 
discuss issues, but 
also to relax and en
joy one anothers com
pany, said Dean of 
Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy.
For the freshmans 
parents its impor
tant that [the Uni
versity has] events.
When [our daughter] 
was a freshman, we 
went to see the presi
dent speak. We felt 
that our daughter had really landed 
in the right spot, said CMU parent 
Joan Rowland.
The University planned a variety of 
events, from a robotics seminar to facscheduled events. Seven student am
bassadors were hired to greet and as
sist families during the weekend. They 
were here to provide exceptional cus
tomer service, said Hoover.
In spite of the many resources, some 
families were confused by the over
whelming number of events and an 
incomplete program that did not list 
the locations for events. The way it
ties, especially because of the combi
nation with the International Festi
val, said Murphy.
Those who did attend the events 
appreciated a place for parents and 
students to interact. At the same 
time, many of the lectures and pro
grams were geared to interest par
ents rather than students. There 
wasnt anything we could do toulty speeches to tours of Pittsburgh.
The weekend, titled A Gathering of bombarded with too many options, oth
ers found the activities enhanced the 
weekend. [International Festival] is nice 
because it gives students something to 
do with their parents, said junior psy
chology major Rachel Schwartz.
Some say they do like it. Others say
Friends, was planned extensively by 
Mary Hoover, director of Family Week
end and a coordinator of Student Life. 
To ensure success, pre-registration was 
available and an informative Web site 
was created. An information hotline,
in addition to the Web page, allowed its too much, said Hoover, 
students and their families to obtain My sense is that there is a bit more 
information about hotels, parking,.and - going on than at many other universiwas arranged was really strange. It gether.... I was surprised. Last year
was so much bet
ter, said Starr.
Parents, however, 
valued the events 
which kept them 
busy while then chil
dren were unavail
able. You can let 
them have their 
space and at the 
same time grab them 
whenever you can, 
said CMU parent 
Gerri Huryk.
The Huryk fam
ily attended the 
mens soccer games 
to cheer on their 
sons team. Its 
good to have them 
support the team 
because not a lot of 
kids come out, said 
David Huryk, a 
sophomore biology 
major and a mem
ber of the CMU soc
cer team.
Low publicity for Family Weekend 
made it difficult for some families to 
attend University-sponsored events. I 
didnt really notice anything going 
on, said Skevos Psaras, a junior me
chanical engineering major. Poor ad
vertising and the overwhelming num
ber of activities. contributed to low 
attendance at many events.
We havent seen [our daughter] in 
two months. We wanted to see how 
she was doing, said CMU parent 
James Liu.
Were just using this weekend as an 
excuse to see our daughter, said CMU 
parent Richard Rowland.

we wanted to do were hard to find for

admit tolerance, Addou said.
Because of the authoritarian 
power and corruption that gov
erned Algeria, the people be
came ^increasingly dissatisfied 
and revolts occurred. In 1984, 
the Islamic political party took 
control of the government with 
the hopes of suppressing the dis
content of the masses.
At that time, all the 
rights of Algerian women 
were, taken away. The Is
lamic government felt this 
was necessary in order to 
restore the strength of the 
patriarch.
The leaders of our coun
try would say that the 
women have to go home.
They are taking our jobs.
If they go home, we will 
bring back moral order,
Addou said.
In addition to women 
being denied the oppor
tunity, to work, they were 
also forced to wear veils

People say, Why do they go to 
work? They can be killed. I 
have never thought to stay

Despite the restrictions that 
women must face every day, they 
are, in fact, major players in the 
political system.
Unlike other places, women
power over the Algerian people. 
While resistance to the partys 
power has been increasing, 
200,000 people have been killed.
The organizers of the Interna
tional Festival felt Addou was a 
timely speaker in that the Ameri
can media has recently been giv
ing the situation in Algeria a great 
deal of coverage. While Addous 
speech was moving, it also was 
informative in that it shed light

Women who refused risked the in Algeria are very different. Alchance of being killed or gerian women have a part in the

sexual slavery.
The government does not want 
to lose the upper hand over 
women. They have taken away 
the womans stature, Addou said.
I was not shocked by the

Ive had the same kind of ex

Addou said.
While the mid-80s brought 
oppression into the lives of Al

I was pleased to see people 
engaging in discussion follow

The University Center is a fairly ster
ile space. High, brightly-lit ceilings have 
their merits, but where is the sense of a 
gathering place for people? This week, 
when walking through the wide, hollow 
corridors, occasionally you might have 
heard the sound of drumming. It is a 
little odd, given the nature of the place. 
The sound of a drum is a very human 
sound; it is the sound of civilization and 
culture. It is the sound of people working 
together, exactly the opposite of the sort 
of interaction implied by the design of 
the University Center.
This past Saturday I had the chance to 
watch a group of people working to
gether with the dance form Capoeira. 
Gapoeira 'tomes from the .Caribbean, 
parts of Angola, and Brazil. It was in
vented by slaves out of the traditions 
they brought with them from Africa. 
The movements are low, quick, and fluid. 
Though it is very rhythmic, it is hard to 
ever be sure of what the dancer will do 
next. Capoeira is functional; it served as 
a combative training tool. The planta
tion owners believed it was only danc
ing. Slaves werent allowed to learn to
fight, so they learned Capoeira.
Capoeira is also an art form; the noncombative versions of the dance are a 
celebration of the human form. It was 
the celebratory form of Capoeira that 
the workshop I watched focused on.
The instructor was a lady with a lot of 
energy, assisted by three drummers; 
she lead a group of eight students 
through a Capoeira series. She encour
aged each student to strive for perfec
tion. Frequently she would send a dancer 
back to try it again. Everyone found 
some degree of success, but those who 
were able to release themselves and 
really listen to the sound of the drums 
made the greatest connection to the 
movement.
As the workshop progressed, a small 
group of people gathered outside the 
glass window of the aerobics room. Many 
watched the entire class, and several 
expressed interest in trying the dance 
themselves. Because there were no 
breaks, and because the dance became 
more difficult and complex as the work
shop progressed, it was almost like 
watching a performance.
When Capoeira was developed for com
bat, the movements were designed to be 
intimidating. The dancer tries to fake
out his competitor through unpredict
able and surprising moves. In the joyful 
version of Capoeira, the moves once de
signed to fake out become moments of 
discovery for the dancers and audience. 
One particular movement, asuddenjump 
in the air resolved upright with the hands 
on the hips, caused a reaction of delight in 
the audience outside of the room. The 
jump came right out of the quicker lower 
movements, and was still a surprise, 
even the third or fourth time.
The workshop required some dance 
experience  so only a few people had 
the opportunity to really participate. 
The joy of Capoeira is in have the oppor
tunity to try the movements. Perhaps 
some of time could have been devoted to 
the beginners.
The workshop altered the environment 
of the University Center. For awhile we 
were all watching or dancing together. 
It is the strength of the art form that 
allowed a sense of community is what is 
normally a cold place.

semble Kuumba Workshop will perform 
Langstons Hughes Black Nativity De
cember 5-21 at the University of Pitts
burgh. Tickets are $15.00.

The show 
gave an 
excellent 
represen
tation of African fashion, which 
most Americans would be 
clueless about.
Ayala set up the typical stereo
type of the African fashion: na
ked upper body, bare bosoms with 
breasts flapping in the air, and 
raffia skirt for the lower body. 
Then she and the models dis
pelled this idea as the fashions 
were displayed. African people 
have always been fashionable, 
said Ayala.
The fashions were full of bril
liant colors and vibrant pat
terns, hand and machine
There is no beauty in a headtie that is 
not wrapped properly, neither is there 
beauty in a properly-wrapped headtie that 
does not fit the head of the wearer."
 Yoruba proverb
erb about headties: There is 
no beauty in a headtie that is 
not wrapped properly, neither 
is there beauty in a properlywrapped headtie that does not 
fit the head of the wearer. 
The patterns on the clothing 
were also traditional, having 
history of their own. The mud 
cloth pattern, traditional to the 
people of Mali, appeared on sev
eral of the more modern out
fits, modeled by Karim, 
Michelle Manson, a freshman 
in CIT, and Justin Mingo, a 
junior in IM.
One of the most interesting pat
terns was a wedding outfit, mod
eled by Aminita Croulet, a fresh
man in H&SS. The outfit was 
printed with the picture of the 
bride, a common way Nigerian 
people honor the bride and groom.
Jumoke K. Ewedemis store, 
Alafia, an Africashop, provided 
all of the fashions seen in the 
show. She set up a table out
side the auditorium, to display 
and sell clothing and jewelry. 
Much of the jewelry was sym
bolic, the elephant symbolizing 
good luck, copper for healing, 
masks for protection, and the 
cowrie shell for life and abun
dance of blessing.
_________________ But none
of the items 
for sale 
were used 
in the traditional 
Yoruba 
rituals. 
Those are 
too sacred 
to sell, said 
Ewedemi.
The show was a fun and lively 
occasion, in large part because 
of the crowd. Ronald 
Fernandes, a PhD student at 
Heinz, commented on the 
shows variety. I thought it was 
a great, great idea, he said. It 
was good that all the models 
werent African, that all differ
ent countries were repre
sented. This statement is just 
proof that even to the casual 
observer, African styles are uni
versal, appropriate, and fun for 
all people, regardless of race or 
nationality.

Kayaga of Africa graced the Inter
national Festival with a drum work
shop that not only entertained and 
informed, but gave participants an 
opportunity to understand a culture 
by being a part of it.
The main element in their work
shop was; of course, the drums.
One was a bare wooden piece, 
double-headed with supple light 
tan leather that matched the 
unadorned wood. The heads, 
arching over the sides of the drum, 
were bound by criss-crosses of thin 
leather. The hide of a scaly reptile was 
smoothed on to the head of a long highpitched-drum. Three kettle-like drums 
of decreasing size sat in a line on the 
floor. Covered with luxurious brown and 
black spotted cowhide, they called to 
mind papa bear, mama bear-, and baby
bear. Around the rim of the drums I saw 
how the wear of vigorous playing had 
smoothed and shined the head, and I 
realized that despite my reverence of 
their natural and simple beauty, they 
were not objects merely to stare at.
A young woman cheerfully waved us 
toward the drums circled in the center of
the room. The group was from Uganda, 
she explained, and they would be teach
ing us four pieces from east Africa. She 
introduced the masters Dan and 
Mohammed and immediately the lesson 
began. The Kayaga players smiled, 
pointed us toward drums, and began to 
play. After a few minutes they indicated
that we should join in. We tried to keep 
up but after a few phrases, Mohammed 
stopped us and clapped out the rhythm. 
Gwanga mujje! Gwanga mujje! We 
beginners repeated it, Gwanga mujje! 
Gwanga mujje! On the drum, he com
manded. I held the stick limply and beat 
out Gwanga mujje. The others joined 
in faster, and faster, louder 
and louder. Gwanga 
mujje! Gwanga mujje! 
Gwanga mujje! called the 
drums. People come! 
they pleaded urgently. 
Outside, parents and sib
lings and students milled 
around, eating O-fries, and talking about 
the new Purnell Center for the Arts, and 
how cold it was. How could they resist 
the call of the drums? But it didnt mat
ter because we were all in a groove. Our 
minds and bodies were completely fo

I must admit that my expectations 
were not too good for A Life Less Ordi
nary. When I first learned that the plot 
involved two angels coming down to earth 
and getting two people together, all I 
could think was cheese city. Since the 
film is the work of the same people who 
created Trainspotting, I wondered how 
they could go from one extreme to the 
other. Needless to say, I was pleasantly 
surprised with A Life Less Ordinary. By 
no means the striking, film that 
Trainspotting was, it nevertheless is a 
pleasantly absurd take on the romantic 
comedy.

 1997 Twentieth Century Fox 
Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) plays an assertive yet out-of-work janitor.
Our first clue that this is not a normal 
film from the genre comes in the opening 
scene. Amidst an all-white background 
that recalls George Lucas THX-1138, 
angels in white suits and dresses scurry 
in an office-like environment. Their ob
jective is to bring romance to various 
people on earth. OReilly (Delroy Lindo) 
and Jackson (Holly Hunter) havent been 
doing so well lately, and so they receive, 
an ultimatum: They must succeed on 
their newest case or be banished to earth 
forever. The potential match? Robert 
(Ewan McGregor), a cleaning man in a 
gigantic corporation, and Celine 
(Cameron Diaz), the daughter of the 
companys boss.
Robert has recently been fired and
unsuccessfully demands his job back, 
and after he escapes the security guards 
who try to eject him from the office, 
kidnaps Celine.
Unfortunately for him, hes not very 
good at it, and she has to help him quite 
a bit. From here on out, the angels have 
a lot of work to do bringing the two 
personalities together.
The whole film feels 
absurd, from  Roberts 
bad hairdo to Celines 
habit of shooting apples 
off peoples heads, and 
this is what separates it 
from the normal roman
tic comedy.
The fact that the angels appear as normal humans and not 
muted supreme beings keeps them from 
being a painfully cute plot device. Their 
superior, Gabriel (Dan Hedaya), is 
grumpy enough to be an inner-city de
tective, yet he is drawn lightly enough to . 
come off as laughable. The plot itself 
also seems to be a nudge from the film
makers; it is entirely unbelievable and 
knows it.
The direction by Danny Boyle is 
above-average, with many tilted cam
era shots and unusual angles, and he 
has the ability to make the ordinary 
interesting. He has good help in cin

The only thing I would say detracts 
from the film is the mysterious ending 
that includes kilts, claymation-style 
animation, and a castle. I didnt really 
understand it, but then again, maybe I 
wasnt supposed to. I got the impression

play the songs to an extent where you 
become tired of listening to them.
After listening to the album over and 
over, I found that this is the wrong way 
to approach the album. Scan through 
initially and, depending on your mood, 
home in and pick a song to listen to. 
Afterwards, scan forward and find the 
song which sounds the most similiar 
and repeat the process.
Although this might sound somewhat 
absurd, its the only way you can gain a 
true appreciation for the album and all 
its qualities. Some of 
the songs are quite

you in with mere 
rhythm and finesse of

I dont really know 
where to begin when I 
start to speak about the songs. To say 
that they are merely a blend of different 
sounds of this era would do it no justice. 
Alternative music is something I wont 
really pick up on unless its drilled into 
my head by the radio stations, so natu
rally you wont find me at the store 
buying alternative albums, but 
McNarlands album is excellent. Even 
the extremely hardcore alternative songs 
are somewhat easy to listen to. You can 
actually go through the 11 songs with

wonder how she goes from screaming to

WRCT to host local bands at monster mash
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
In 1947, back when CMU existed prima
rily as an engineering school, a student in 
electrical engineering started a small radio 
station for his class assignment. As a small 
carrier-current project, Radio Carnegie Tech 
broadcasted through mainly dorm rooms 
and major academic buildings. Today the 
1750-watt freeform station not only reaches 
listeners throughout the city and its sub
urbs, but is also one of the leading influences 
on Pittsburghs independent rock scene.
In honor of its 50th anniversary, WRCT 
will host Tainted Candy, its own monster 
mash this Halloween in the Weigand Gym
nasium. With 10 bands, three DJs, hor
ror films, and the traditional (and not-sotraditional) party games just-like-mommade-you-play-back-in-the-day, the radio 
station plans to celebrate its birthday 
and at the same time show off some of 
Pittsburghs indie-rock talent.
The station started in the direction of 
independent rock about 15 years ago with 
local discoveries of punk rock and new wave, 
said Doug Mosurak, WRCTs jazz director 
and a senior English major.
The costume ball will feature Don Cabal
lero, a local group that has been touted as 
one of Pittsburghs best kept secrets. As a 
heavy instrumental rock band, Don Cabal
lero has defeated the popular contrivance 
that modern listeners need vocals.
These guys are excellent musicians  
and they dont let that get in the way of 
making good music together, said Neil 
Donnelly, general manager of WRCT and a 
junior materials science engineering stu
dent. [WRCT1 has been supporting [Don 
Caballero] since they started outand 
theyre still getting a lot of airplay. 
Don Cab havent played locally in 
three years, as they have just recently 
reformed in town, said Mosurak. But 
just about every time I saw them live ... 
it was an epiphany.
While most Pittsburgh bands tend to 
stay close to home, Don Caballero has 
snagged numerous gigs from Cleveland 
to Chicago.
When Pittsburghs rock scene gained 
some local momentum between 1988 
and 1989 WRCT members were inte
gral participants in the local music 
scene as well, said Mosurak. As the 
years progressed it seems to me that 
the influence the station had on these 
people managed to shape the direc
tions of what was to come, what we 
have now, and what will continue to 
happen, he said.
Other bands to play at the benefit 
include Young Pioneers, Rye Coali
tion, Four Hundred Years, The Im
possible Five, Operation: Re-informa
tion, Jumbo, The 1985, Lustre King, 
and Hurl. The costume ball will be the 
last show for both Don Caballero and 
Hurl, another local group supported 
by WRCT. I feel really excited that 
such a momentous occasion could be 
tied in with the 50th anniversary, 
said Mosurak. Ive been to at least 75 
percent of the shows Hurl has played 
around here in the last five years.... A 
lot of their songs carry very special 
meanings with me.
These [local indie-rock] bands play
live on WRCT and we spin their records as they 
come out. I think the station plays a pretty big part 
in getting the bands noticed around town, which is 
a pretty big step to start regional touring, said 
Mosurak.
Each set will last roughly 45-minutes, 
with DJs spinning in between sets. 
Donnelly expects a minimum of 200 people to 
attend the concert. This is a good chance to hear 
good bands  a chance to expose yourself to a lot 
of different kinds of music, said Donnelly.

Don Caballero, a local band, will play on Friday night

Tribal Ugandan dances 
praise traditional rhythm
By TOM LIANZA
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The African dance on Friday night 
was one event in particular as to which
I was completely uneducated. I was not 
sure what to expect, but I was looking 
forward to seeing something that I had 
never seen, perhaps experiencing a cul
tural activity that I never understood. 
Indeed I got what I expected  colorful 
costumes, rapid dancing, and music cre
ated by not much more than the mouth 
and the hands.
The opening dance was said to have 
been performed in front of a Ugan
dan king. This dance set the tone for 
the evening. Two brightly clad 
women danced at high speeds, mak
ing music as they went because there 
appeared to be bells on their ankles. 
Two men dressed in white played 
drums with their bare hands, and 
the rest of the music consisted of 
shouts and singing.
Perhaps the most enjoyable part of 
the show was when the Kayaga dance 
group asked for volunteers to come up 
and play the drums. Five kids got up, 
and a man gave them each a rhythm to 
play. Once they had all got going, the 
man on-stage started to dance to the
music. The audience smiled in particu
lar to a young boy who was beating the 
smallest drum.
The audience was then taught a com
mon greeting where we ask phonetically 
copano? meaning How are you? and 
they respond copei! meaning Fine, 
thank you. This was a small break from 
the action and it regulated the pace as to 
not let the audience forget that they 
should be participating. The actors kept 
the viewers involved in the show, and 
asked all of us to move up so we could be 
in a group.
They next did a dance in praise of the 
cow. The dance itself simulated the 
movement of the animal, and this con
cept was extremely foreign to me. Ameri
can tradition doesnt involve worship of 
or behaving as animals.
Watching the dances was very inter
esting, and it broadened the horizons of 
the ethnically diverse crowd.
In a time when dances like this are 
only seen on PBS specials, it is great to 
see them in person. Whereas your aver
age American viewer might change the 
channel past traditional dances, the au
dience was completely into it. A good 
time was had by all who attended, and 
the beautiful Ugandan dances will not 
soon be forgotten.

The Hewlett Gallerys new exhibition 
is dry despite its content. Trek of Tears 
consists of color photographs that docu
ment recent migrations of people in 
Rwanda and Burundi. Though the art
ist, Martha Rial, gives us a frank por
trait of migrant life, there is something 
lacking in the presentation and compo
sition of some of her photographs. The 
photographs are journalistic, in that the 
event occurring in the photograph is 
often more interesting than the raw 
image itself.
The photos are mounted beneath glass, 
flat on the wall, more in the style of a 
museum placard than artistic prints. 
An enlarged color print, Grateful, domi
nates the gallery depicting a small boy 
surrounded by the hands and feet of 
adults. The boy smiles up at the viewer.
The photos are colorful, bright and 
realistic. It is refreshing to see a photo 
show that is more real than artistic. 
Looking at color prints reminds us of 
family photo albums, or newspaper ar
ticles; this connection brings Rials im
ages closer to the personal world viewer. 
Still, Trek of Tears, like other color shows, 
wrestles with the problem of maintain
ing cleanliness of composition.
Rials composition, in many of the 
photographs, is far from striking, and 
is even, at times, cluttered. A photo
graph of several people in a graveyard, 
consisting of dark mounds of dirt and
twig crosses, seems almost mundane 
until I read the tag: Graveyard of Chil
dren. Once I knew the significance of 
the image, I began to feel something. 
The photograph on its own was mean
ingless. Similarly, a man sitting out
side of a thatched roof construction look
ing at the sky has little significance, 
unless you know that it is his First 
Taste of Freedom.
The shows lack of drama can be seen 
as something of a strength. Because 
the images are not stark and dramatic, 
the subjects are humanized. When look
ing at the shows charter imageBitama, 
it is easy to forget that she doesnt 
speak English. She looks familiar, like 
the girl next door. All of Rials images, 
even Dying Alone, which depicts an 
orphan crumpled with hunger and dis
ease in a hospital bed, are immediate 
and real. Because her images are real, 
we know that the pain and suffering 
depicted in this exhibit is a part of our 
world, not some ideal world of art be
yond our own experiences.
Some of the images are quite strong: 
notably, Moment of Solace, in which a 
small boy clings to his mothers bright 
blue apron. The apron dominates the 
frame. It is an excellent use of color. The 
title Moment of Solace is a bit narrative, 
but excusable because of the connection 
between the concept of solace and the 
color blue. Another strong photograph is 
Food Distribution Day, in which several 
people stand behind a rough hewn fence 
waiting. The feeling of hunger is made
evident through their hands, which they 
rest through the fence. The fence be
comes obstacle seeming to hold the people 
back, despite their relaxed attitudes. It 
is a image that shows the suffering that 
occurs when a persons life is forced to be 
primarily concerned with most basic of 
human needs.
The arrangement of Trek of Tears is a 
bit haphazard. The images come in no 
particular order. This lessens the possi
bility of story telling through a series of 
related images, or a sense of journey for 
the gallery visitor. Rials enlarged im

dom. Its position at the center of the far 
end of the gallery causes the visitor to 
expect Grateful to hold some special 
significance. I was puzzled as to why 
this image was more important then the

of life and death does causes the viewer 
to see the migrants as whole people, 
with lives consisting of both beautiful

Band rules historic indie scene
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
With record companies toting 
the coming of the British 
reinvasion, Britpop, which went 
out when grunge came in, is sud
denly fashionable again. Bands 
like Oasis and Elastica are all
Who: Pulp
What:Greatest Hits
Company: Red Rhino
experiencing the sort of sudden 
fame that hit the Stones and the 
Beatles 30 years ago. However, 
some bands have been waiting 
around for a good 10 to 15 years
terial, which for the most part, 
has never been heard by their 
new fans.
Aside from discs like Count
down Pulp, which is sort of a 
chronicling of greatest hits, Pulp 
has also re-released their first 
and second full-length albums in 
their entirety. These albums may 
be a surprise, though a pleasant 
one, to fans of Pulps most recent 
incarnation. They are clearly ex
perimental and reflect a great 
deal of the bands maturity, or 
lack thereof.
It, released in April of 1983 
by Red Rhino Records, is a much
Hold Your Hand. However, some 
of Pulps current trademark sar
casm is evident even in this first 
album when one hears lyrics like 
Ive got this love inside of me 
and then notes that the name of 
the song is Wishful Thinking. 
Pulps second album, Freaks, 
released a full four years later, 
sees the band leaving the 
navet of It far behind. The 
first song, Fairground 
aquaints the listener rather 
quickly to Pulps newfound dis
illusionment and anxiety. 
Cocker is certainly not refer
ring to a Barnum and Baileys
for their overnight success. 
Pulp, formed in 1978 by a 15- 
year-old Shefieldian named 
J arvis Cocker, is one of these over
looked bands. Pulp has been an
different Pulp than the one of type fairground.
Different Class, mainly beSome sort of freakish Ray 
cause, well, its happy. This Bradbury creation maybe more 
poppy album exhibits the song accurate. Instead of idealizing
love, Cocker mocks the 
joy he once found in it. 
Songs like  I Want 
You are sweet pop 
tunes without lyrics 
like I want you/1 need 
you / Ill keep you / Ill 
keep you and Ill throw 
myself away. Sugary 
flutes have been re
placed by darker in
struments like clarinets and 
violins (played masterfully by 
Russel Senior, who has unfor
tunately left the band recently 
to pursue other interests).
These albums may be a surprise, though 
a pleasant one, to fans of Pulps most 
recent incarnation. They are clearly ex
perimental and reflect a great deal of the 
bands maturity, or lack thereof.  __________

TICKETS ON SALE NOW
By ANDREW FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Although they have had a profound impact 
on the rock and roll of the past few decades, 
it has been quite some time since the Rolling 
Stones have released anything really com
pelling. Their recent albums, including Tat
too You, Steel Wheels, and 1994s Voodoo 
Lounge, are all solid efforts, but dont ap
proach the impact of watershed discs such as 
Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street. 
However, their most recent effort, Bridges to 
Babylon, is the Stones most engaging album 
in years. Songwriters Mick Jagger and Keith 
Richards enlisted a slew of producers to shape 
and enhance their tunes, and have produced 
a brilliant record that is neither formulaic 
nor untrue to the Stones roots.
Who: The Rolling Stones 
What: Bridges to Babylon 
Company: Virgin Records
The Rolling Stones are as proficient a band 
as ever, with Richards and Ronnie Wood 
creating blues-based rock melodies, Jagger 
bringing out various shades of emotion, and
drummer Charlie Watts effortlessly propel
ling each tune. In addition, they get some 
help from producers Don Was, Danny Saber, 
and the Dust Brothers, which gives the al
bum a varied yet still cohesive feel. Was 
produces the first and last portions of the 
disc, which include driving rockers as well as 
poignant ballads. The first track, Flip the 
Switch, as well as the first single, Anybody 
Seen My Baby, both balance classic Stones 
melodies with new styles to create energetic, 
meaningful pieces. The album concludes with 
several slower tunes, including Thief in the 
Night, a ballad sung by Keith Richards, 
featuring mellow layers of sound to back 
Richards contemplative vocals.
While the Was-produced tunes are cer
tainly worth a listen, up-and-comers the 
Dust Brothers (Beck and Beastie Boys) and 
Danny Saber of Black Grape give the album 
its real depth. Saber contributes Gunface, 
a powerful, driving tune with aggressive 
vocals from Jagger. The Dust Brothers help 
out on Saint of Me and Might as Well Get 
Juiced, perhaps the two best tracks on the 
disc. The former builds a slow groove and 
explodes into a hook-filled chorus, while the
latter creates a rather modern-sounding 
soundscape to enhance a very engaging song.
Throughout Bridges to Babylon, Jagger dis
cusses topics such as relationships and vio
lence, as is customary. What makes Bridges 
different is Jaggers ability to do so from a 
mature perspective, without seeming out of 
date. Indeed, that seems to be the purpose of 
this record: to bring out the old styles that have 
defined the band for so many years and add 
new influences to create something compel
ling. And did they ever pull it off.
The classic Stones return with a new album.

Welcome to the not too distant 
future. In this time humans give 
birth to children with all genetic 
imperfections removed, and all 
aspects of their chemical makeup 
recorded on a computer. But young 
Vincents (Ethan Hawke) parents 
decided to give birth the traditional 
way; without the aid of geneticists 
or DNA manipulation. Thus he is 
born with a 99 percent chance of 
heart failure and an estimated 
lifespan of thirty years.
| What: Gattaca 
1 Director: Andrew M.Niccol 
J Company: Columbia Picj tures
In the future, genetic deficien
cies qualify you as an in-valid 
citizen, and the only jobs you can 
get are menial ones. This reveals 
discrimination in its purest form. 
It is Vincents dream to be a pilot 
in space, but his genetics make 
him too inferior to be hired by 
Gattaca Aerospace Corporation 
as anything but a janitor. How
ever, like today, there are illegal 
ways of falsifying ones identity.
Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) is a 
manparalyzed from a car acci
dent with flawless genetics. For a
price which Vincent 
gladly accepts, Jerome 
provides him with blood, 
urine, hair, and any 
other bodily debris re
quired to pull off a switch 
in genetic identity.
Thus Vincent becomes 
Jerome Morrow to the 
rest of the world. He is 
then faced with the chal
lenge of traveling into 
space, while competing 
with his genetically su
perior co-workers, and 
meticulously concealing 
his true identity.
His plan starts to dete
riorate near the scene of 
a murder in Gattaca, 
where they find one of 
his eyelashes that they 
identify as belonging to an in
valid. Vincent is the chief suspect 
of the murder, but no one knows 
who Vincent is. They all know 
him as Jerome  one of the best 
workers on the force, due to travel 
into space at weeks end.
Gattaca presents a fascinating 
scenario in which a man, doomed 
from birth, is pitted against the 
ideals of a futuristic Earth. Ethan 
Hawke does an excellent job in 
playingthe role ofVincent/Jerome, 
and he does a decent job of show
ing the audience the intricacies of
Uma Thurman co-stars with Ethan Hawke
his character. On this character 
rests the message of the movie  
that the human will is stronger 
than the human body. Perhaps 
the most intriguing individual in 
the entire movie is Jerome Mor
row. This actor does a superb job 
with the most complex role, and 
vividly shows the audience the 
emotions involved in relinquish
ing ones own identity.
Uma Thurman plays Irene 
Cassini, Hawkes love interest in 
the film. The romance aspect of 
the movie was neither necessary
in the techno-drama, Gattaca.
nor interesting. Uma Thurman 
did not play an important role, 
and her acting talents were not 
taxed at all. There seemed to be 
very little depth to the love story, 
and the focus of the viewers emo
tions was definitely on the plight 
of young Vincent.
Keep your eyes peeled for a cameo 
from Gabrielle Reece, and dont for
get that this is Andrew M. Niccols 
first time directing a major motion 
picture. The film is fairly emotional 
and fits its slogan well: There is no 
gene for the human spirit.

over the new respiration tax. One of the riot police 
trainees drops his gun and runs crying home to

To quote the guy who wrote the column before me, 
these creatures are just like Muppets, except the 
Muppets are angry and have big teeth. What a 
perfect Halloween movie. Heidi the Hippo finds her 
husband Bletch the Walrus in bed .with a sock 
puppet and Trevor the Rat is trying to score himself 
some hippo action of his own. Theres drag abuse, 
venereal disease, extortion, colorful Vietnam flash
backs, robbery, AIDS, and murder all wrapped up in 
a soft flour tortilla served with your choice of Span
ish rice or refried beans. Its kind of like Pulp Fiction 
in the guise of a puppet show, except its more sick 
and tasteless and goddamn funny.

Men In Black
When I was in Los Angeles this summer I was 
working at a Starbucks Coffee shop in Brentwood. I 
had served the same black-haired woman on several 
different occasions when finally I took a good look at 
her and said, Has anyone ever told you you look a 
lot like Linda Fiorentino? She kinda looked at me 
funny and then mumbled something about yeah she 
had heard that before. When I came back with her 
drip coffee, she said, You did a good job with the 
name, though. Most people mutilate it. I said thank 
you, wondering what she meant exactly. After she 
took her seat, the girl I was working with punched 
me in the arm and said, You idiot, thats her! I felt 
stupid, so I offered Linda a free chocolate graham 
cracker. She didnt take it.
Linda won her role in this movie and $1200 from 
Barry Sonnenfeld in a poker game. If I had $1200 Id 
buy a plane ticket and fly to Ghana.

Rhythm masters rejoice in steady beats
Stones come out from under their rock
DRUMS, from page L9
riding the energy of the other players to nirvana, and then 
Mohammed signaled the end. The 
wave broke in a thunderous clap 
on the upbeat and there we were 
looking around at each other, 
laughing and. completely dazzled 
that we had pulled it off.
Dan introduced the next piece. 
Sagala agalamide... that means 
... keep working! Get up! Dont be 
lazy. After teaching us the basic 
rhythm Mohammed introduced 
breaks that began on the down
beat and then resumed mid 
phrase. Sagala agalamide,
sagala agalamide, sagala 
agalamide... GA'-la-MI-de. But 
once we had mastered that 
Mohammed pushed us further. 
Each drum has a voice and we 
want to hear each voice. said 
Mohammed. Some drums say 
Hey!  He growled the word. 
Some drums say, Heyyyyy!  
He stretched it out in a wavering 
falsetto. Other drums say TIEY! 
 he said in a deep James Earl 
Jones voice. He began the piece 
again but this time in a round. 
All the drums started together 
and then after the break he si
lenced all the drums save one. A
lone voice called out to the oth
ers Sagala agalamide! Come and 
work! and then the others, heed
ing the call, rejoined.
The last two pieces were more 
narrative. The rhythms of the 
Baki Simba mimicked the move
ments of different members of 
the ancient kings court during a 
festival dance. The larger drums 
that set the pace represented the 
kings stomping round the court 
while higher pitched drums and 
shakers mimicked the graceful 
shimmying of the women and the 
agile steps of the young men. 
Lastly the Kizino dance mimicked
the movements of cows, animals 
that were once very important to 
Ugandans. The piece began with 
a steady downbeat. The cow is 
sedately, slowly walking. Then 
the beat is doubled and the cow 
begins to walk a littler faster, a 
little more eagerly. It is doubled 
again and then syncopated. Now 
the cow is running and jumping 
around, overjoyed just to be a 
cow, and suddenly the piece ends. 
For an hour we had been united 
children of Uganda, and through 
our drumming we carried on her 
traditions while experiencing 
something pure.
