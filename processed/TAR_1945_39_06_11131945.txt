Womens Guild Dance Promises 
To Be An Outstanding Success
L,K,
Dr. D. F. Miner 
Selected Director
Dr. Douglas F. Miner, Westinghouse professor of engineering at 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
since 1933, has been named Assistant 
Director of the College of Engineer
ing and Science. Dr. Miner has been 
on leave of absence the past three 
years while serving as a Lieutenant 
Colonel in the Army Air Forces. He 
will continue as the Westinghouse 
professor and as a member of the 
faculty of the Department of Elec
trical Engineering.
Dr. Miner came to Tech in 1938 
from the Westinghouse Corporation, 
where he was manager of the En
gineering Laboratory and Stand
ards. A native of Connecticut, he 
was graduated from Clark Univer
sity, Worcester, Massachusetts, with 
his Bachelor of Arts degree, later re
ceiving his Bachelor of Science and 
Electrical Engineering degrees at 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute. In 
1940, the University of Pittsburgh 
conferred on him honorary Doctor 
of Engineering.
At Carnegie Tech he has been in 
charge of the Carnegie-Westing
house Cooperative Plan by which 
the George Westinghouse Scholars 
combine their college work with 
work for the Westinghouse Corpora
tion. He has served on various com
mittees including the Admission 
Committee, the Defense Committee, 
the Junior Social Relations Commit
tee, and others.
P&D Dept. Bestows 
Martin Leisser Award
Three members of the P&D de
partment have received a prize of 
forty dollars each for their entries 
for the Martin B. Leisser Award. 
Gus Kermes won the junior award; 
Lynn Wallace the sophomore award; 
and Louise Richards, the freshman. 
The work done by Gus Kermes and 
Lynn Wallace is now on display on 
the top floor of the Arts Building. 
Guss work contains a notebook of 
sketches from the Mississippi River, 
sketches of the Pennsylvania Dutch 
in Lancaster County, a group of 
water colors, and a brief written 
statement. Both Lynn Wallace and 
Louise Richards submitted written 
material which pointed out their 
purposes and interests.
This competitive award was open
ed to the members of the three 
classes: junior, sophomore, and
freshman, the award was to encour
age personal and professional ini
tiative, intelligent self-direction and 
coherent self-appraisal. This years 
award was based on the statement 
which revealed the highest value in 
the students development resulting 
from the constructive use and in
telligent appraisal of his summer 
activity.
These awards are made possible 
by the Leisser Art Fund which was 
set up by Charles H. Leisser upon 
the death of his brother, Martin B. 
Leisser, a well known Pittsburgh 
artist.
Final arrangements have been 
completed and it appears that Techs 
first semi-formal dance will be one 
long remembered by every student. 
The dance, sponsored by Wom
ens Guild, is being planned un
der the co-chairmanship of Jane 
Branagan and Dorothy Federman. 
It is to be held in the mens gym
nasium on November 17, from 9:00 
until 1:00, with music furnished by 
Brad Hunt and his orchestra.
The dance, a girl dates boy af
fair, will be the Tech girls chance 
as Sadie Hawkins to grab the boy 
for an evenings entertainment. As 
previously announced, when the girl 
extends the invitation, she is to buy 
the ticket while leaving incidental 
costs including flowers up to the boy. 
So, girls, why not give the boys a 
break and ask them to the dance if 
you have not already done so? The 
time is drawing short and many of 
the boys are biting their fingernails 
still hoping to get an invitation to 
the dance that every boy and girl 
should look forward to as one of the 
real highlights of the first post-war
Notice to Vets
A bulletin board has been placed 
outside of Room 155 on the first floor 
of Industries Hall for posting notices 
for veterans. All veterans are re
quested to refer to this bulletin 
board at frequent intervals as the 
Veterans Center will use this means 
of contacting veterans.
social season at Carnegie Tech.
The price of tickets for this func
tion has been set at $2.40 per couple, 
including tax. They may be secured 
from any member of the Womens 
Guild, although they are being 
handled under the chairmanship of 
Mary Keefer.
Decorations are to be handled by 
Dorothy Federman and her commit
tee including Ann D. Groomes, An
na Jane Zimmerman, Jane Culp, Jo
anne Hipp, and Joy Ray Clark. Re
freshments will be handled as usual 
by the very capable APOs.
During intermission a new form 
of entertainment is being planned 
which will vary greatly from that 
of the past. The Womens Guild has 
planned a big surprise for those who 
come, a surprise which should prove 
to be of great enjoyment to all. We 
cannot tell you what it will be; so 
come, satisfy your curiosity. It will 
be a surprise even beyond your ex
pectations.
I reiterate, Carnegie has entered 
its first social season since the col
lege has returned to a peace-time 
basis; so your cooperation in this 
and the coming social affairs may 
greatly decide the status of campus 
social life for seasons to come. Every 
girl likes to go to a semi-formal 
dance. Here is her chance to ask a 
boy and assure herself of a wonder
ful evening. So, girls, get on the 
beam and dont let the other girl 
beat you to that guy you have been 
eyeing.
Freshmen Blacksheep 
Receive Punishments 
At Campus Fun Night
Came Friday, November 9th, came 
oodles of Frosh, came FUN NIGHT
 the night when the books were 
balanced by Student Council and 
the freshmen were obliged to pay 
off or be rewarded accordingly. All 
who passed their traditions exam 
and obeyed regulations are now 
proud owners of Tech buttons, but 
those who were naughty had to per
form to the satisfaction of the up
perclassmen.
The evening started out with a 
bang  in fact quite a few bangs  
as the Freshman band gave their 
rendition of a few Tech songs. To 
insure the safety of those involved 
names must not be published. (Mor
al: Never sit in the front row.)
Adeline Hildegarde H e r 1 i c k 
then called for the first offender to 
lead the crowd in a cheer and a song. 
With grim determination the frosh 
set forth to do his best  but the 
crowd of seasoned Techites were a 
little ahead of him. He was still 
pushing the Tech locomotive after 
the last sound from the multitude 
had drifted off into space.
I bet Audrey Green and Ellene 
Milie will obey regulations if they 
ever get a chance again. Try to sing 
the Alma Mater unaided by the 
Glee Club. The victims tried. Bob 
Tattersall, second semester fresh
man, who had to try twice to pass the 
traditions exam and regulations, was 
called upon to propose to our mis
tress of ceremonies. He did a much 
better job evading the exam, be
lieve me! I suppose freshmen dont 
get to propose very often.
A little leg art  pull up those 
trouser legs men  Betty Ann Boch 
had to satisfy those bloodthirsty 
upperclassmen by obtaining various 
articles from the audience, among

QdUta'i'l A>uncltcU>i
Nobody Reads the Darn Thing Anyhoo!
Since editors are always griping, and since people are always griping 
about editors griping too much, and since people are always griping about 
editors not griping enough, were going to try to satisfy everybody this 
week by griping and not griping which is impossible and well probably 
get knifed in the back instead. (So were doing a very poor job of imitating 
Casey Stine. Or is it Gertrude?)
Oh no! No. No, no, no, no, no!
What is this horrible rumor were hearing? Somebody tells us that our 
beloved faculty, bless em, is arranging a sweet little iron maiden for us 
next semester. It seems that a lot more students are expected at the begin
ning of next semester and that a lot more faculty members are not ex
pected at said time sooooooo in order to even things up the braintrusters 
have devised a lush little schedule for the kiddies which will run from 
8:30 to 5:30 Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Tuesday and Thursday too! 
There must be an easier way! Were definitely in favor of 8:30 to 4:30 
classes because we could get started on our extra-curricular activities even 
earlier in the day that way. But 8:30 to 5:30, oh NO!
Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes;
We hear that Council is feeling quite low because their Frosh regula
tions didnt pan out quite as beautifully as they expected. Rumor has it 
that a couple of the counselors were thinking of buying one gun and two 
bullets (we must stay within our budget you know) to do away with them
selves. We intended to agree with somebody and here we are disagreeing 
again. We think they did an excellent job. Hanging up a hoary tradition 
is not so easy to do as it sounds. It takes quite a while for the thing to get 
firmly attached to the wall. Boy, we really stretched that poor little meta
phor, didnt we? The guys and gals on Council who know what they planned 
to do naturally feel that the product does not live up to expectations, but 
to the frosh it looks pretty good. To quote one of the young and innocent, 
Sure we had fun obeying regulations. They made us feel it was worth 
while getting into the joint. Fun Night may not have been a howling 
success, but the Frosh had fun so what the heck? If Council just hangs 
onto the advantage theyve gained by overcoming campus inertia and 
starting Regulations, and if a few other organizations such as Interfra
ternity Council have enough school spirit to support the project, next 
years freshmen should have a really wonderful time.
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh my.
Why is everybody not there when they should be? Why is everybody 
ready to do everything until theyre needed to do something? Why aint 
nobody dependable? Why does everybody complain all the time about the 
publications not doing this and that, and the frats and sororities not doing 
this and that, and the administration not accomplishing that and this, 
and not doing anything about it themselves? So were complaining again! 
Why is it that only two of the Bond Queen candidates care enough about 
the victory loan to turn in bonds? Why is it that everyone is willing to 
enjoy the decorations at the dances and no one is willing to do the decorat
ing? Why dont we all give up and go to night school? Life is a trap.
Tch, tch, tch, tch!
A couple dozen of the P&Ds have turned in a slight complaint. It 
seems they crave illumination. Theyre all going rapidly blind in their 
hideaway on the fifth floor of Fine Arts. They think it would be nice to have 
a few fluorescent lights and some of those cute little glass walls like in 
the Coffee Shop. They are now slinging palettes and easels all over the 
fifth floor in a mad battle over whether they want their projected redecorat
ing job to be done in two shades of gray like Dr. Watkins office or black and 
aaahhh-no-not-that orange like the beanery.
Daaaaaaaaaaaa
Reason for the above screwy mess: (Could there be a reason?) Your 
editress is not mad asdfjkl; she merely wanted to see if there is anyone 
who reads the silly column. Shell know if the complaints start rolling in, 
cause this one it would have been just as well if you hadnt.

One of the Girls
Its the way of all flesh! . . . 
Does some one have an extra hair
net? . . . All right mother Wagman 
. . . May I help you pick your trous
seau? ... I can never get any 
books from that Library ... 
Thank you, Sound Effects Man! 
Your reporter is desperately trying
to get an interview. I say Miss 
Wagman ... Yes ... oh there 
goes the bell, I have a cookery 
class. Well, (sigh) its all in the life 
of a reporter and a home ec stu
dent!
Time passes by and we find Mar
tha Kaye Wagman in civilian clothes 
and ready for the great ordeal. Al
ways on a reporters list of popable 
questions are activities. So:shes 
president of AEPhi; shes a repre
sentative on Senate; she was on the 
Tartan for two years; shes a senior; 
and she has never used Ponds.
Martha, known to the gang as 
Mattie, adapted the latter varia
tion from the fashion designer, 
Hattie Carnegie. You know Hattie 
and Mattie  well, Mattie thought 
perhaps she could divert some of the 
talent of said designer by a sim
ilarity of names. So dont forget the 
name . . . Who knows, in a few
Martha Wagman
years you may be wearing a Mattie 
original.
Business and pleasure seem to run 
along the same lines for Mattie. She 
just loves to cook. As a culinary art
ist she has achieved fame for her 
chocolate cakes. In a few weeks she 
will be in Home Management House 
and has promised her fellow inmates 
that theyll have chocolate cake for 
dessert seven days a week. (The 
proof of the pudding is in the eat
ing, so I hope, ahopa, hopa.)
Believe me, this sophisticated miss 
has other talents too. She can talk 
with her eyesoh and what else she 
can do with those brown orbsask 
any engineer. Last year she was vot
ed the girl with the most beautiful 
eyes on campus. (Chalk up another 
for Miss W.)
Lost: One fur coat. Finder please 
notify Miss Wagman. Over the sum
mer it seems that Matties coat just 
vanished into storage never to be 
found again. It might be insured but 
that isnt any consolation to Mattie. 
I quote: I dont want a fur coat, I 
want my fur coat. So keep your 
eyes peeled for my fur coat when 
the weather gets cold. Well track 
it down yet. (M. W. See Business 
Manager for cost of this advertise
ment.)
Matties favorite topic of conver
sion is beyond a doubt her brother 
who just returned from India. He 
certainly must be a wonderful guy. 
(Im plugging for an intro!)
I guess if Mary had a lamb, Mattie 
can have a dog to follow her to 
school. However, shes one up on 
the booksshe occasionally brings 
her dog to school. Torchy, just a 
bit of a pooch, is a quiet, attentive 
scholar when permitted to attend 
classes.
Ah to the realm beyond  MEN! 
Mattie just loves them and insists 
she is playing the field (with the 
call of a wolf in the distance.) She 
likes to pick out her own men how
ever and dislikes people who go

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
One of the Veti
Don Lewis, Electrical Engineer 
Interviewed by Tartan Reporter
Plaid red shirt . . . friendly smile 
. . . brown, laughing eyes . . . 
thats Don Lewis, the electrical engi
neer from Mercer, Pennsylvania. 
Don spent a little over five years in 
the Army before he came to Tech; 
it was the first time in his life he
had been away from home for any 
great length of time, and on this 
occasion he traveled half way 
around the world. Of all the occult 
places he saw in his journeyings, 
Don says that South Africa was the 
most enjoyable. In his own words, 
They rolled out the carpet for us. 
Getting back to the U.S. after such 
wanderings excited no delirious joy 
in Dons mind, but rather just a 
feeling that its good to be back 
along with a sort of pleasant numb
ness that accompanied the realiza
tion of what had seemed a near im
possible dream.
When asked, Why did you come 
to Tech?, Dons eyes lit up; he gave 
a little chuckle and said, Well, to 
tell you the truth, I had a hard time 
convincing my Dad that his Alma 
Mater, Penn State, couldnt compete 
with C.I.T.s engineering reputation,
CIT Lags in Fund Drive 
With One Week To Go
Kent Shaffer, head of Carnegie 
Techs War Fund drive has announc
ed we have given two-thirds of our 
quota to the drive so far this year. 
Of this, 1,060 dollars came from the 
students, both day and night; the re
mainder from the paid staff. Al
though Mr. Shaffer thinks it is well 
that the downtown office has decid
ed to continue the drive through 
November 21, he doubts that we 
will make a perfect tally. Fortunate
ly, this is due not to the student 
body, but to the staff, some mem
bers of which are rather slow in 
making good their promises.
Theres more than dollars and 
cents involved in the United War 
Fund campaign. That is why, 
points out chairman N. H. Weidner, 
if we lack 10 per cent, fewer chil
dren will be given the services of 
our child welfare agencies and 10 
percent less care will be given to 
our old folks, our homeless, and 
physically handicapped.
Every contributor and every vol
unteer worker was urged by Mr. 
Weidner to work and give freely 
j and generously for human welfare.
but I finally did it, and here I am! 
And here he plans to stay until he 
gets his degree.
Don complained about the lack of 
social life at the Beaneryoops, 
excuse us, we mean Skibo. As far as 
dancing in the afternoon is concern
ed, he thinks that its usually most 
appropriate in night time but in 
college anything can happen and 
usually does.
His hobbies, secondary to women 
of course, include photography and 
that Tech prerequisite, bridge! On 
top of that, hes finding time for 
the wrestling team. His philosophy 
of life is that everything happens 
for the best. Although Don ordi
narily refrains from committing 
himself on controversial subjects, 
we did manage to wangle an opinion 
out of him on the Skybo-Skeebo 
question: Don just calls it the mess 
hall!
Dons friendly manner and easy
going disposition have made him 
one of the really popular fellows in 
hft class, and our opinion is that if 
he is typical of the veterans coming 
back to school  well, send us more 
vets. Welcome, Don  Youre one of 
us and were really glad to-have you.
Outlines
On November 6 an exhibit on The 
Camera in Science and Art will be

not possible, wear jeans or any other 
old clothes you have handy because 
a rough but enjoyable time has been 
promised all.
AIEE Plans Smoker 
In Faculty. Lounge
Next Friday, November 16, the 
student branch of the American In
stitute of Electrical Engineers is 
sponsoring a Get Acquainted 
smoker in the Faculty Lounge ad
joining the new Skibo. The meeting 
proper will start at 6:30 p. m. fol
lowing an informal dinner in the 
Skibo to which all Electrical Engi
neering students are invited. Fresh
man are particularly urged to attend.
The highlight of the meeting will 
be a talk by Dr. E. M. Williams on 
Radio and Radar Warfare, fol
lowed by discussion and questions. 
Refreshments will close the meeting 
at about 9:30.
Dr. Williams is particularly well 
qualified to present such a subject. 
He came to Tech from Wright Field 
where he was in charge of the de
velopment on radio counter meas
ures and of radio control for guid
ed missiles for the Army Air Forces. 
In addition, he was in charge of all 
army television.
Fun Night

them a mans garter. The boys prov
ed to be mighty shy  but chivalry 
eventually took precedence over 
modesty and a garter was brought 
into sight!
Lady killer Vince Benja had to 
woo Sid Berkowitz! Bribing him 
with a beautiful bouquet of roses, 
he made him pin up boy of Scobel 
Hall. . . . Nadine Henry then com
mitted herself to a little experiment 
to determine the advisability of tap
ping in size 14 GI shoes. . . . Bashie 
Burnside auctioned a vase which 
turned out to be a clay head  but 
who minded with such a beautiful 
auctioneer?
Freshman regulations were then 
formally concluded. A funeral march 
around Thistle Hall, with all fresh
men bowing in sorrow to the sym
bol of dead Freshman Regulations, 
frosh hats and ties in a casket, fin
ished regulations for the year. The 
rigors of six weeks of regulations 
were forgotten in the dancing that 
followed.
HEADS GOT 
TOGETHER
RESULT: MORE TRANSCONTINENTAL 
TELEPHONE CIRCUITS
With wire scarce and wartime calls increasing, 
telephone engineers made existing pairs of long 
distance wires carry nearly four times as many 
calls as before. This was done through installa
tion of additional carrier equipment, requiring 
closer spacing of the wires on the line and trans
positions at shorter intervals.
Three pairs on the Southern Transcontinental 
Route were rearranged, and in a 430-mile section 
this had to be done while keeping the urgently 
needed wires in service all the time. To do this, 
new tools and new methods had to be devised 
in the laboratories and on the job.
This is another among many examples of how 
Bell System teamwork and engineering skills 
maintained telephone service under wartime 
conditions.

Four Burps to the Breeze Depart
ment: Burp One (and it gives no 
end of pleasure to write this) is for 
that vile movie downtown called 
Johnny Angel. In the publicity 
blurbs in the news-sheets, it says 
Hear Hoagy Carmichael sing 
Memphis in June.  I would have 
loved it. Burp Two is directed to
wards those people at the Autumn 
Frolic who made remarks like this: 
Oh, THOSE dramats are giving en
tertainment AGAIN! Little do they 
know how much work it takes to get 
an entertainment such as that to
gether! Burp Three is for the Tar
tan review of the recent play in 
the Little Theatre. Burp Four is for 
those persons who painted the Sen
ior Fence white. It, at least, looked 
rustic before.
Mundane Mummery: The Stine 
description of Kahns: Where The
Girls of Birch Hall Give 
Party for Frat Men
Saturday evening, the girls of 
Birch Hall threw a party in the 
Carnegie Union, for the purpose of 
getting acquainted and having a 
good time with the fellows from 
Delta Tau Delta and Beta Theta Pi.
The Union was decorated with 
pink rats and pink streamers, in 
keeping with theme, A Pink Rat 
Party. A bar was set up in the din
ing room where punch, pretzels, 
sandwiches, and cake were served.
The dorm girls did much to put 
over a good party, and (apparently) 
were also interested in trying to 
make the Thanksgiving dance a suc
cess.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
 CIT SPORTS 
Oberlin Booters Lose to Tech
The Magnificent Mudders did it 
again! Were not referring to any
bodys relatives, but to the Carnegie 
soccer team which rolled along to 
its fourth straight win last Saturday 
by whipping Oberlin, 4-1.
For a while last week it looked as 
though the boys werent going to 
have their usual mud-puddles to 
play in, but, come Friday, sure 
enough, Ole Man Mose turns on the 
heavenly faucet and by Saturday 
morning the field was in its usual 
condition. All things considered, the 
weather wasnt so bad as game time 
rolled around, though, and a respect
able brand of soccer was forthcom
ing at the start.
Perry Scores
The teams were evenly matched, 
and as things moved along, a ter
rific game was on the fire. Neither 
side would give an inch, but Tech 
got a break at the end of the first 
quarter which spelled Oberlins 
downfall. The Tartans slammed the 
ball into the mouth of the Oberlin 
goal and the Oberlin goalie dropped 
it, After a big scramble (which 
changed Techs colors from red and 
white to black and black), Oberlin 
got the ball out of immediate dan
ger. Just then Bill Perry, outside 
left, pulled one of the best shots of 
the season by shoveling the ball 
over the mass of humanity lying on 
the ground and into the goal for 
the first score.
Second Goal Added by PerryAfter the teams changed ends, 
Perry again demonstrated why he 
is considered one of the best out
sides in the district (thats O.K., 
Bill  any time) by looping in a 
shot from ten yards to the left of 
the goal. I have no doubt that any 
Prof in school could have proved 
that that shot was mathematically 
impossible, but Tech wasnt going to 
quibble over technicalities and the 
score stood 2-0. Nothing momentous 
happened in the next ten minutes 
except that some of the clouds over
head started to drool and the field 
became a sea of mud. Taking ad
vantage of the situation, Perry slid 
past the Oberlin backs and lofted a 
shot toward the center. The ball 
bounced off an Oberlin fullback and 
into the reach of Ray Aynaoglu. 
Ray made short work of it as he 
banged it home for another tally. 
The Crimson and Gold were not to 
be outdone, however, and they too 
took advantage of the mud to beat 
the Tartan defense and make the 
score 3-1 at the half.
Tech did its best to rack up some 
more in the third period and came 
awfully close on several occasions, 
but luck was with Oberlin and noth
ing came of it.
Down Went Williams
Comes the fourth quarter and Bob 
Williams provides the laugh of the 
day by landing flat on his back in 
the middle of a puddle. I wont say 
he was black, but word has it that 
he was offered a contract in a min
strel show right after the game. 
After the applause quieted down 
play was resumed and Tech showed 
some of the teamwork that coaches 
dream about. Erkun grabbed the 
ball, beat the Oberlin halfbacks, 
passed it to Aynaoglu who in turn 
sent it along to Mellott. Cloyd made
all the effort pay off as he sent the 
ball through the uprights for the 
final score and another win to add to 
Techs unbroken string. Lineups:

Intramural 
Round-Up
The schedule is drawn and com
petition is starting tonight for the 
Intramural Volleyball Cup. Eight 
frats  Beta Sigma Rho, Beta Theta 
Pi, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon, 
Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon, Tau Delta Phi, and Theta Xi 
and one dorm-combinegoing un
der the handle of Scwelchform 
the complete list of entries. All are 
to play on Tuesday and Wednesday 
nights with the first two contests 
getting underway at seven and the 
third at eight. 21 points is a game, 
and two out of three games consti
tutes a victory. There will be no 
action next week because of the 
holiday.
Schedule:
Tuesday, November 13 
7:00 SAEs vs DUs 
Betas vs Delts 
8:00 PiKAs vs Scwelch 
Wednesday, November 14 
7:00 Beta Sigs vs Tau Delts 
TXs vs Delts 
8:00 SAEs vs Scwelch 
Betas Take Cup 
The Betas won the touch football 
trophy in spite of themselves or 
rather because of the PiKAs in the 
only activity on the intramural 
scene last week. It was the SAE 
slaughter at the hands of the PiKAs 
that handed the championship to 
the Betas who found themselves a 
bit roughed up by the Delts in a
17-1 ball game.
Table Tennis 
Table tennis entries are due in 
the Intramural office this Friday, 
November 16, at five. There will be 
singles and doubles tournaments for 
the campus crowns and team com
petition for the trophy. The teams 
must have at least four men as the 
matches will be decided by four 
singles and one doubles.
All-Points Trophy
The Intramural Board has an
nounced that the All-points Trophy 
will be awarded again. The trophy 
goes to the organization with the 
greatest aggregate of points at the 
end of the winter semester. The sys
tem gives a certain number for team 
entry, games won, and campus 
championship depending on the par
ticular sport. Touch football is 50 
for team entry, 10 for each victory, 
and 100 for campus championship
Varsity Sports 
Taking Spotlight
The situation in Thistle Hall every 
Monday, Wednesday and Thursday 
at five does not speak too well for 
Tech students. With over six hun
dred boys spread between Engineer
ing and the Arts and only two var
sity sports on campus it seems there 
should be slightly more interest in 
wrestling than has been shown to 
date. Only four boys have come out 
to take advantage of the first-rate 
instruction offered by Coach Alex
ander. It is good clean sport that 
will put you into shape and provide, 
a great deal of pleasure and satis
faction. Experience is not necessary
 a coach like Mr. Alexander can 
make a grappler out of anyone with 
a few brains, a little strength, and 
a touch of muscular coordination. 
Swimming Team
Swimming Coach Risedorph has 
been training a squad of thirty-one 
men for the past two weeks. In 
order to have the team well equip
ped for the coming meets, the Coach 
has been grounding the team in the 
fundamentals, and stressing devel
opment exercises. Since nothing else 
has been done at this point all oth
ers who are interested should re
port at the next session. The team 
is in particular need of divers, so 
come on fellows, all you men with 
potentiality come out and show your 
stuff. This is a good time to improve 
your style, and be the pride of the 
pool.
At this time Mr. Risedorph thinks 
that the team looks a little stronger 
than last years, but he is reserving 
further comment until after he is 
able to see his boys in real competi
tion.
with 50 going to the runnerup. Vol
leyball and table tennis have a 35-5- 
50 distribution with the second team 
getting 25.
The story on handball is sad. Un
less a few more entries turn up, 
that lone application in Coach Risedorfs office is headed for the scrap 
basket.

In last weeks issue a certain gang 
was slighted, this being the swim
ming team. For those who dont 
know it, Coach Riesdorph has been 
putting his squad through their 
paces for the last two weeks. No
body seems to know how many are 
out for the varsity because no two 
guys show up at the same time, but 
its in the neighborhood of 30 and 
prospects are bright for Tech to be 
well represented in the H20 this 
winter.
PiKA Actives Meet Their Match
The few people who were around 
the Cut Friday afternoon were 
treated to a rare sight. The PiKAs 
had themselves a football game be
tween the actives and the pledges. 
Needless to say, it was raining like 
mad, but undaunted, the teams 
took the field and soon became in
distinguishable from each other. 
When the game was finally called 
(because nobody could find the 
ball), the pledges held the upper 
hand by approximately 16-0.
Tech Team Can Make History
Rummaging through the records,
I find that this years soccer team 
has a chance to make history. Tech 
has never before had an unbeaten, 
untied soccer team. The boys have 
but one game left before they hang 
up their size No. 40 pants for the 
year. If they can beat Grove City 
this Saturday, the drinks will be 
on the house (Heaven knows they 
wouldnt be on the Skibo.) Every
body who wants to see history in 
the making, get out there Saturday 
morning and give the boys a little 
moral support.
Techs cheerleaders made their 
debut at the game last week. The 
only comment I can make is that 
they were lucky the Delts were 
there en masse or they wouldnt 
have had anyone to lead.
Backfield Lauded
Credit where credit is Due Dept.
 What is behind the scores of the 
soccer team? Sure, its teamwork 
and sure, the line has been playing 
wonderful ball, but its mostly due 
to three solid citizens of the back
field. Im talking about Joe Hart
man, Red Kindblom and Bob Wil
liams. These guys dont get their 
names in the papers for scoring 
goals. Neither does anybody cheer 
when they break up opponents 
plays, but they have a lot to do with 
the final score whether anybody 
realizes it or not. Williams undoubt
edly has the most powerful feet in 
Pittsburgh and has a terrific knack 
for being in the right place at the 
right time. Hartman and Kindblom 
can both give that ball a jolt and 
usually give the opposing offense 
quite a jolt too. Yes, theres more 
to this game called soccer than you 
read in the papers and its very 
comforting to a goalie to have three 
rugged customers like these out in 
front of him. (Believe me, brother,
 I know.)
Notice
There will be a meeting of anyone 
interested in working on the fea
tures staff of the Technical on Tues
day, November 19 at 5 P. M. in the 
Union.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1945
One of the Boys
Bob Skinkle
Hear that brisk step; hear the 
cheerfully whistled strains of Co
relli in the old Corral or Bachs 
little G Minor Fugue coming your 
way? You wont have to wait for an 
engaging grin to appear in the door
way to know it Bob Skinkle, a jun
ior in the music department. Yes,
:Spi .
..
m
youve heard of him before. This 
year hes president of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon, director of Interfraternity 
Council, student director of and 
chief agitator for the Mens Glee 
Club, and a writer for the Scottie.
That Bobs Tech career has been 
varied is a gross understatement. 
It all began August 27, 1942, at 3 
oclock in the afternoon when he 
started out to be a chemical engi
neer. For five semesters a certain 
engineering student spent his 
spare (?) time in the music depart
ment writing on reams of manu
script paper, playing the piano, and 
gathering As in evening school har
mony courses. Came the turning 
point . . . Fall 1944 saw a first se
mester sophomore in music emerge 
from the chrysalis of a second se
mester junior in chemical engineer
ing.
Now his activities on campus 
could keep two men busy; and as for 
his work in the music department, 
he is a composition and public 
school major studying double bass

and bassoon, learning to play, write 
and arrange for a wide variety 
of other instruments, playing the 
piano, and composing (all this be
sides the required music courses). 
But Skink is more than a campus 
leader and an avid music student. 
He is a top notch telephone operator 
you should hear his Presbyterian 
Hospital, one moment plee-uz. He 
is one of those bridge players who 
knows whats in everybodys hand 
(without peeking, mind you) before 
they play their third card. He is a 
gourmetan authority on such del
icacies as poached eggs, shad roe, 
iced tea, and blueberry muffins. But 
his favorite food is the avocado pear. 
(While we are on favorites, his fav
orite instrument is the symphony 
orchestra; his favorite composers 
are Tschaikowsky and Shostakovich, 
with Chopin, Beethoven, and Bach 
right in there, too.)
He has been active in SAE and the 
Mens Glee Club all the time he has 
been a Techite. He has worked part 
time and summers as a telephone 
operator at Presbyterian Hospital 
and on the Tech switchboard. (Bob 
made a lot of Tech friends through 
his cheerful manner and his rich, 
vibrant telephone voice even before 
they met him in person.)
There are two memorable Tech 
legends about R.L.S. No one who 
attended Greek Sing and Swing last 
spring will soon forget the SAE 
quartet which entered, organized by 
Bob, directed by Bob and singing 
music arranged by Bob, with Bob 
as second tenor. Their only purpose 
was to make a showing so that the 
large groups wouldnt have too easy 
a time winning the cherished cup 
but SAE won, in the midst of much 
hilarity. The other story concerns 
a famous political campaign quota
tion, I will not be terrorized by the 
administration, which Dr. Dawes 
used as a question in last springs 
campus queen contest.
Bob Skinkle is giving his best to 
Tech; Tech, in return wishes him 
(1) the best of luck while he is still 
on campus (2) his ultimate hearts 
desire. If he gets what he deserves, 
someday well all celebrate together 
at the premiere performance of a 
great American symphony.

Business Mixed With Pleasure 
Highlighted Assembly Party
The revision of the Constitution of 
the Evening Student Council was 
presented to the student body by 
President Chester Biscup at the As
sembly Party on November 10. The 
Preamble of the revised Constitu
tion is as follows:
So that the Evening Students of 
the Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy may be served more efficiently 
through the Evening Student Coun
cil and taking cognizance of. the 
many changes put into effect on the 
campus since the Constitution of 
the Evening Student Council first 
went into effect, a revision of the 
present Constitution of the Evening 
Student Council is hereby adopted 
in order to reflect the present growth 
and trend.
The purpose of the Evening Stu
dent Council is to create interest in 
the extra-curricular activities on 
the campus, to establish harmony 
between the numerous departments 
on the campus, to present the stu
dent problems, viewpoints and 
needs to the faculty and adminis
tration so as to bring about a better 
understanding. It is the medium 
through which student opinion is 
reflected to and from the adminis
tration and faculty.
The Evening Student Body will 
be afforded closer and better repre
sentation and cooperation through 
the medium of the amended Consti
tution and this should work towards 
bringing into the extracurricular ac
tivities more students and thereby 
spread the work of Conncil through
out the entire evening campus.
The entertainment planned for 
the party by the social chairman, 
who toiled long and hard, was en
joyed by all. First on the program 
was a magician who held his audi
ence in spellbound attention. Dur
ing one of his acts, Mr. Yohi asked 
Fred Vichich to assist him. No 
doubt Fred thought he would see 
all and know all, but when he left 
the stage, he scratched his head in 
dumbfounded bewilderment.
The next presentation was a mo
tion picture entitled Unfinished 
Rainbows, a picture showing the 
discovery of aluminum and the fore
sight, courage and ability of the 
men who founded The Aluminum 
Company of America. Although 
rather a technical subject, it was of 
great interest and the appearance 
of Alan Ladd in the cast was quite 
a surprise.
Then came the time everyone was 
waiting for  refreshment time, and 
the delicious minced ham sandwich
es, cookies and pop were quickly 
devoured. Between bites of these 
hunger-satisfyers, the jovial group 
raised their voices in a community 
song fest. Such favorites as Ill Buy 
that Dream, Till the End of Time 
and of course that song that is al
ways heard when good friends get 
together, Down by The Old Mill 
Stream were sung, screamed shout
ed or what have you.
Everyone was disappointed when 
twelve oclock rolled around and 
they had to go home.
JletieAA. tothe
This is a letter of thanks to the 
Editor, and members of the PLAID 
staff for the warm welcome I re
ceived the first evening I visited the 
PLAID office.
This is my first semester at Car
negie Tech and still having School 
Spirit from years gone by, I de
cided to visit the PLAID. The editor 
and staff of the PLAID were very 
friendly and initiated me by having 
me write my first article. It wasnt 
very good, Ill admit, but it was pub
lished.
Many students coming to evening 
classes have never heard of the 
PLAID so you can do your good 
deed for the day and on Tuesday 
evening pick up an extra copy to 
hand to the student sitting next to 
you in class. You may have heard 
of the PLAID but he or she, as the 
case may be, may not have. It wont 
be any trouble on your part to take 
along an extra copy, you know it 
doesnt cost anything. The first copy 
of the PLAID that I read was given 
to the members of our class by a 
considerate teacher. You can show 
your school spirit by picking up that 
extra copy of the PLAID on Tues
day evening.
Most new students coming to Tech 
for the first time feel that this staff 
is comprised of a certain clique and 
outsiders are unwelcome. Thats 
where youre wrong, I really know. 
You too can participate in school 
activities. I did it! So can you.
In the PLAID columns I noticed a 
letter to The Editor which provoked 
considerable thought in my mind 
and prompted me to endeavor to re
ply thereto. The particular letter 
appeared in last weeks issue and so
licited information regarding the 
evening campus in general. The 
thoughts contained in the letter are 
well put and, althought it would re
quire several columns to fully pre
sent all the answers, efforts will be 
made to give pertinent information 
on the various interesting points.
The first thing to remember is 
that the activities, like everything 
else, have suffered because of the 
war. Most everything attempted on 
the campus has been handicapped in 
one way or another. Even the func
tions of the Evening Student Coun
cil have been curtailed greatly.
From the time the Evening Stu
dent Council was formed and or
ganized until the year 1943, the even
ing students were presented with 
an Evening Student Council Hand
book. This handbook contained in
formation which would have an
swered most of the questions pre
sented by the questioning evening 
student. The Council endeavored to 
meet the emergency by publishing 
a little supplement which was dis
tributed to the students as they regSocial Committee Need 
Support of Students
The Evening School Council has 
appointed for the year 1945-46 Frank 
Mihelich as Social Chairman and as 
his assistant, Virginia Ehni. Betty 
Ashcraft was appointed Publicity 
Chairman and will be assisted by 
Ann Rawlings. It is the responsibil
ity of these people to plan the social 
events for the Evening School cal
endar. This is a real task and pro
vides a man-sized job for the com
mitteemen. They need your support 
to make these events a success, so 
when you see the advertisements 
announcing the dates, come out and 
back them to the limit. They need 
you, therefore plan to attend all 
functions arranged by the workers 
and make your time at C.I.T. as 
Evening School Students provide 
more than book work.
Bulletin Board for Vets
A bulletin board has been placed 
outside of Room 155 on the first floor 
of Industries Hall for posting notices 
for veterans. All veterans are re
quested (to refer to this bulletin 
board at frequent intervals as the 
Veterans Center will use this means 
of contacting veterans.
Drama Dept. Presents 
The Trojan Women
The Drama Department has an
nounced The Trojan Women by 
Euripides as the second production 
of the season. It will be presented 
in the Little Theatre, College of Fine 
Arts, from November 16-20; three 
additional performances will be 
given November 26, 27, and 28. 
There will be a matinee on Satur
day, November 17, at 2:30 p. m.
Tickets for this play may be ob
tained in the Evening School Office,

istered. In the Foreword it can be 
noted that reference is made to the 
causes of the curtailed program.
Now that the war is over, or at 
least many of the restrictions are 
being lifted, it is hoped that next 
year the Student Handbook will 
make its appearance regularly 
again.
The PLAID has also attempted to 
make the evening students acquaint
ed with the activities program by 
publishing items of interest. In the 
columns also have appeared invita
tions and solicitation for evening 
students to come out and register 
their names as workers. Every Fri
day evening, after class, the PLAID 
is made up and considerable work 
is done and workers are needed. An
other invitation is herewith extend
ed to any evening student to come 
out and meet the workers and Coun
cil.
