SDC, Student Life plan to end dorm solicitation
by Laine Towey
TUUEUSDAS YHiU 52ES/L
CMU has recently been the target of many com
panies attempting to get students to use their ser
vices, but many students feel some companies 
have gone too far. A recent rash of door-to-door 
solicitations within the dorms prompted Student 
Life to send out a campus-wide email reminding 
students about solicitation policies and also 
attempting to increase security so that it will be 
harder for companies to get into the dorms.
Representatives from VarsityBooks.com and a
hair salon located in Shadyside allegedly entered 
into the dorms without permission and went 
door-to-door, knocking on students doors and 
attempting to solicit business. Many of the stu
dents who felt uncomfortable and threatened 
contacted Student Dormitory Council about what 
had been going on.
Earl Crane, President of SDC and a senior 
mechanical engineering major, said that student 
action is important when it comes to combating 
the solicitations. Its essential that we have the 
support of everyone to enforce these policies; the 
RAs and the campus police can only do so much, 
said Crane.
The increase of commercialization on campus 
has not gone unnoticed by many students, but for 
a long time, advertising was limited to posters in 
the UC and chalk on the sidewalks around cam
pus. Much of the campus now feels that compa
nies actually going into the dorms is too extreme 
a form of advertising.
I just think that there are other ways of adver
tising and reaching students without invading 
their space; its kind of intimidating when people 
come up to you and you feel very pressured when 
they ask you to buy stuff, said Kirsten Raschdorf, 
a first-year music performance major.

Members of Indiegrrl came to CMU on Tuesday February 15. Lis Harvey and her band, as shown above, were one 
of the groups to perform at the event. Indiegrrl started with about 10 women in May of 1998 as a mailing list 
for women in the independent music industry and is now a major method for networking between female artists.
Dining Services changes food provider

Where can you find Smiley cook
ies end fresh food made from 
scratch? While they may not be 
available at Highlander or the UC 
now, a new agreement with 
Parkhurst Dining Services, a divi
sion of Eat n Park restaurants, may 
soon bring items such as these to 
i campus. Dining Services plans to 
! improve the quality and service of 
campus food by hiring this new 
food provider.
The University has signed a 
short-term agreement effective 
through the end of the academic 
year with Parkhurst Dining 
Services. Parkhurst will head the 
new management team and Jane 
Fahringer will serve as the on-site 
general manager.
We will implement Eat n Park 
items where and when we can, 
however, some of the items are

strictly controlled, Fahringer s?id. 
She is concerned that the university 
may not be currently outfitted with 
some of the equipment needed, and 
there is also the issue of employee 
instruction.
Fahringer has a positive outlook 
on the training portion of the new 
services. We plan to bring out the 
talents of the staff by doing a lot of 
training from a culinary aspect as 
well as customer service training, 
Fahringer said. She said she doesnt 
expect any major increases or 
decreases in staff, but the focus will 
be on increased communication 
and a lot of training.
As a freshman I remember 
Smiley cookies being given out at 
Highlander ... I welcome any 
improvements to Dining Services, 
said Heather Wightman, a junior 
mechanical engineering major.
I used to eat at Schatz and 
Highlander pretty regularly, but 
over time Ive seen the quality of 
the food deteriorating. said

Although students may see some 
of the famous Eat n Park menu 
items around campus, Fahringer 
said the Parkhurst corporation 
offers a variety of food. The new 
items should be offered in the facili
ties that Dining Services manages, 
including Highlander Cafeteria, 
Schatz Dining Room, Chic-Hens, 
Grab &' Go, Roseli, and catering ser
vices. Outside vendors maintain the 
other campus eateries and will not 
be affected by the change. At this 
point the new items are not expect
ed to change the way students pay 
for meals, and no decisions have 
been made regarding future 
changes to this process.
Other current Parkhurst clients 
.include the Carnegie Museums,

Brawl erupts 
on Quad
by Sara Stille
YHiU 52ES/L
Late Friday night, students on the 
Carnegie Mellon fraternity quad 
came face to face with several mem
bers of the campus police and the 
Pittsburgh police force. After a fight 
broke out at one of the fraternities, 
campus police felt additional back
up was needed and called the city 
police to aid them in dispersing the 
crowd. Some students, however, 
feel that the methods used by the 
Pittsburgh police were excessive.
While patrolling the quad area, 
two campus police officers heard 
yelling coming from the porch of 
Kappa Sigma (Kap Sig) and arrived 
on the scene to see 75-100 students 
in front of the house. The officers 
radioed for backup from campus 
police and city police, along with 
members of the city K9 unit.
The situation was very danger
ous because of the large numbers, 
said Sergeant William Ricci of the 
campus police. We needed backup 
by the city because of the sheer 
numbers of people involved.
It was a very unfortunate incident 
all the way around. Theres a lot we 
want to know about the evening, 
including how the animosity grew 
and why city police intervention was 
necessary, said Paul Fowler, the 
associate dean of Student Affairs.
Campus police reported that the 
incident began when a group of , 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) brothers 
were asked to leave the Kappa Sigma | 
party. One of the SAE members then 
became irritated and a fight ensued.
According to CMU police, the ; 
crowd continued to grow as city and 
campus police attempted to break up i 
the group located around the Kap ! 
Sig sidewalk. The Pittsburgh Police 
report stated that as officers were i

Updates and suggestions on 
changes for the campus were dis
cussed at the third Campus Master 
Plan town meeting held Thursday, 
February 17. Paul Tellers, the 
University Architect, and Kevin 
Lamb, director of Planning 
Services, were present to discuss 
the preliminary plans of 
Ayers/Saint/Gross, the consulting 
firm for the Master Plan.
The process is moving pretty 
i quickly. There will be three more 
monthly visits from the contractors 
before May. By May, we will be pre
senting a final draft to the Board, 
and over the summer we will be 
finalizing the document and work
ing on some of the special issues 
such as traffic studies, said Lamb. 
The expected release of the final 
plan to the campus is fall of 2000.
In the meantime, there are sev
eral plans for the immediate 
future. One of the priorities is to 
try to find a large recreation space, 
big enough for a soccer field, 
which is something we have been 
informed is lacking on the campus 
now, said Tellers.
Lamb and Tellers also feel that 
the campus is not nearly as pedesPaul Fowler, the associate dean of 
Student Affairs, said that there have 
been heightened concerns about the 
area around the streets Morewood, 
Fifth, and Ellsworth. While there 
doesnt seem to be a tremendous 
number of incidents occurring, it is 
one of our main concerns, said 
Fowler. Sergeant William Ricci of 
the campus police agreed that there 
doesnt seem to be an increase in the 
crime off-campus, or even on-campus, but that the distress is still 
there.
A major security issue is simply 
people being less protective. For
that will be showing Wonder Boys 
when it is released this Friday. 
Delaney said that the motivations 
for her company and Paramounts 
decision were no secret. This 
film needs to make money some
how, said Delaney.
Hale said that he was aware that 
the companies just want to make 
money off the movie. He went on 
to say that the companies know 
that CMU students are going to see 
the film in theaters if they cannot 
see it on campus. Even though the 
date for the screening is approach
ing quickly, Hale expressed some 
hope that the University might be 
able to get Paramount and 
National Amusements to agree to 
more than two showings. [We 
will] see what we can do to move 
them off the dime, said Hale.

trian-friendly as it could be. Plans 
are being made to overlap the larg
er spaces of the campus such as the 
Cut with a series of smaller spaces 
to provide connections around 
campus.
Another immediate concern 
deals with the issue of parking. 
Theres not enough parking on 
campus for students and faculty. I 
think the topic of parking needs to 
be dealt with before anything 
else, said William Bennett, a 
junior civil and environmental 
engineering student.
Plans for the relocation of park
ing are underway. One idea is to 
get rid of surface parking because 
it is a waste of space. The topogra
phy of the campus allows parking 
to be placed under fields and other 
green areas. Another popular idea 
is the park and ride shuttle that has 
been successful on many college 
campuses such as the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Part of this process is going to 
include a special task force to look 
at the demands for parking on 
campus. A parking committee will 
work to find ways to get more uti
lization out of the spaces we have 
now and perhaps to allow for more 
flexible permitting, said Lamb.
More long-term plans include a 
See PLAN, page 3
example, leaving doors unlocked 
and walking home alone. Students 
just arent taking enough protective 
measures, said Fowler.
I dont use the shuttle because I 
don't find it very convenient. Its 
much faster for me to walk. In the 
interest of safety ... Ive never felt 
unsafe, said Jon Mayer, a sopho
more industrial design major.
Fowler said he encourages the use 
of the CMU escort and shuttle sys
tems and of the buddy system. We

i-OFF THE WiRE^
Iranians hopeful that moderation remains
TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  On 
rooftops in a leafy suburb above the 
smog, some satellite dishes have 
come out of hiding.
Their owners know its still illegal 
to watch foreign broadcasts.
Theres just not much pressure to 
maintain the old deceptions such as 
concealing the dishes behind laun
dry lines or crates. A few exposed 
dishes hardly count as a bold cry 
against Islamic rulers and their 
controls. Its a murmur.
But listen closely around Irans 
capital and you hear it everywhere: 
a confidence that the breathing 
room opened by moderate 
President Mohammed Khatami two 
years ago is not .going to be choked 
off by his hard-line critics.
At Tehrans first Internet cafe, 
patrons browse almost any Web 
site. Once-banned nationalist songs 
and satire are performed at dinner 
clubs. Underground entrepreneurs 
deliver bootleg videos to peoples 
homes for a weekly rental of 50,000 
rials ($6.25).
Outside, young lovers hold hands 
in public and the Islamic coverings 
for teen-age girls grow shorter and 
tighter with diminishing regard for 
the basij, the volunteer squads 
that were once the unchallenged 
morality enforcers.
I wouldnt say this is paradise.
But at least were not always look
ing over our shoulders all the time 
now, said Ahmad Esteqalian, who 
runs a catering company.
Many still do, however. Twenty 
years of being hyper-cautious is 
hard to wipe away. At the 
Alighapoo restaurant, the host 
takes the stage between sets of 
Persian music to remind women to 
have fun but keep their head 
scarves on.
This is the kind of seesaw world 
experienced these days by most 
Iranians: Buoyed by new freedoms 
one minute; pulled back to earth by 
realities the next. Somewhere there 
may be an equilibrium. But likely 
not until after parliamentary elec
tions in February.
The outcome of the polls could 
help cement Khatamis vision of a 
nation less obsessed with being an 
Islamic standard bearer and more 
occupied with the business of try
ing to fix its many problems, includ
ing sticky relations with the West 
and a stumbling economy.
 But religious hard-liners are not 
prepared to step aside quietly and 
are mobilizing to try to block

Khatamis allies from sweeping the 
polls.
Abdollah Nouri, a former interior 
minister and a close Khatami ally, 
was proclaimed guilty by a jury of 
clergymen November 11 on some of 
the most serious charges ever 
brought against a senior politician 
in Irans Islamic government. The 
jurys opinion was sent to a judge 
who will issue the actual verdict, 
which could include jail time.
The decision by a seven-man jury 
covered 15 charges ranging from' 
publishing lies, insulting Islamic 
sanctities, and advocating better 
ties with Iran's archenemies, the 
United States and Israel.
The legal action appeared aimed 
at preventing Nouri from running 
for parliament speaker. A hard
liner, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, has 
been the speaker of the 270-seat 
chamber since 1990.
Fearing defeat in the elections, 
the hard-liners have escalated their 
pre-emptive strikes.
Government agencies still domi
nated by the hard-liners have 
closed several newspapers  most 
recently the crusading Neshat, 
whose top editor has been charged 
with insulting Islam. Nouris popu
lar newspaper, Khordad, could also 
become a target.
The conservatives may still have 
judicial clout, but public backing is 
clearly waning.
Publisher Hamidreza Jalaei Pour 
believes its only a matter of time 
before the conservatives are shoved 
aside.
We need to begin looking at 
Islam as just a religion, not an ide
ology, he said.
Both sides, however, are being 
extremely careful not to rekindle 
the student-led protests that 
gripped Tehran in July. The rallies 
began as denunciations of the press 
clampdowns and escalated after 
thugs raided a student dormitory.
There are more potential flash
points. A probe into the killings of 
intellectuals and reformers has 
allegedly implicated factions in the 
intelligence service. On November 
2, a court sentenced three people to 
prison terms ranging from six 
months to three years for publish
ing a play in a student journal that 
allegedly blasphemed Islam.
At the base of the uncertainty lies 
a creaky economy. Iran is blessed 
with huge oil reserves. But thats 
not enough to fuel an economic 
engine for a nation with weak inter
national investment, a burgeoning 
young population and an economy 
largely controlled by huge founda
tions that answer only to the 
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei.
The United States blocks all U.S. 
trade with Iran and threatens sanc
tions against others who do.
The desperation for foreign capi
tal creates some interesting con
trasts. Iran  never shy about sup
porting an Islamic cause  has 
been conspicuously silent about 
Russia's military offensive against 
Muslim insurgents in Chechnya. 
Russia is helping Iran build a 
nuclear reactor.
In a basement apartment off a 
Tehran side street, Ramine 
Sadaghieh lives with his 25-yearold wife. He spends his days look
ing for a job. He studied computers. 
But now hed take anything with a 
steady paycheck.
Costs rise on fluctuations in the 
rials value against the dollar. A 
pound of chicken has doubled in 
price since May to the equivalent of 
62 cents  the daily wage for some 
workers.
Even if we wanted to emigrate 
we cant, he complained. We 
dont even have the money for a 
ticket.
The superficial prosperity of 
Tehran frustrates him even more. 
Shops are filled with items that he 
 and many Iranians  couldnt 
dream of buying. Our expectations 
have gotten so high, admitted 
Sadaghieh, 29. We measure our
selves now by what we own. This is 
the new Iran.
A drive (or, rather, crawl) 
through Tehrans traffic-clogged 
streets reveals a keen, almost comi
cal, desire to join the world main
stream. A strange homage is paid to 
America through fast-food fakes: 
Pizza Ehute, Kabooky Fried 
Chicken and mockups of 
McDonalds golden arches.
At a major plaza, a giant mural of 
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini stares out past a bill
board for Cacol, a candy that fea
tures an exact copy of Coca-Colas 
famous logo.
The reformers are trying to find 
a new face for Islam, said 
Houshang Golshiri, one of Irans 
leading writers. Twenty years ago, 
when the clerics said, Go to your 
rooftops and shout Allah Akbar 
(God is Great), everyone was doing 
it. Not now.
National News
Bush defeats 
McCain in S.C. 
primary
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP)  George 
W. Bush energized the conservative 
core of the South Carolina GOP to 
score a much-needed primary victo
ry and stall the surge of rival John 
McCain.
With 99 percent of the vote count
ed, Bush had 301,050 votes, or 53 
percent, to McCains 237,888 or 42 
percent. Alan Keyes was a distant 
third at 25,510, or 5 percent.
The candidates later flew on to 
Michigan where Republicans select 
delegates on Tuesday.
Bush told about 150 loyalists 
assembled at a Grand Rapids hotel 
that he wanted their help in spread
ing his message of lower taxes and 
government reform.
In two days time we have a 
chance to continue what we started 
in South Carolina and that is the 
beginning of the end of the Clinton 
era in Washington, D.C., he said.
Several hundred supporters 
chanting Go, John, go greeted
McCain in the lobby of a Detroitarea hotel. The Arizona senator 
spent about 15 minutes shaking 
hands, but didnt speak publicly.'
The race now heads into an 18- 
state sprint over the next 17 days.
Bush badly needed Saturdays win 
to slow McCain. For months his 
campaign had looked at South 
Carolina as a tradition-minded fire
wall state which could blunt any 
damage from New Hampshire three 
weeks ago, where he lost to Bush.
The Texas governor had a very 
large lead in early polling but 
McCain closed the gap in the past 
ten days  only to see Bush mount a 
$4 million campaign with help from 
special interest groups and surro
gates who questioned McCains con
servative credentials. Six out of ten 
people who voted in the primary 
were Republican, and Bush won 
two-thirds of those voters.
Michigan may be a must-win state 
for McCain on Tuesday, and a poll by 
the Detroit News showed the candi
dates in a tight race. Exit polls in 
South Carolina on Saturday showed 
that McCain failed to best Bush on 
some of his strongest points.
California crash

GILROY, Calif. (AP)  A car mov
ing at least 60 mph crossed the cen

California early Saturday and 
smashed head-on into a pickup 
truck, killing all seven people in the 
vehicles, the Highway Patrol said.
The crash happened on state 
Highway 25 near Gilroy, about 75 
miles south, of San Francisco, at 
about 4:20 am, Highway Patrol 
reported.
Two men in the car, three adults 
and two children in the pickup were 
reported dead at the scene. The car 
was believed to be moving between 
60 and 65 mph in a 55 mph zone.
Witnesses traveling in a vehicle 
behind the car told police they made 
several attempts to get the car back 
onto the right side of the road by 
flashing their headlights, Highway 
Patrol Officer Adam Rodriguez said.
Its very surreal, very disturbing 
to see such death has to happen that 
way when its actually all very pre

Austrians protest 
against Haider
VIENNA, Austria (AP)  More 
than 150,000 flag-waving demon
strators crammed a historic Vienna 
square on a cold, rainy Saturday 
evening in the largest protest yet 
against a far-right partys inclusion 
in the Austrian government.
Throughout the day, tens of thou
sands of protesters gathered for 
smaller rallies at different spots 
throughout the city. Others 
marched through the streets blow
ing whistles and shouting slogans 
critical of the government and 
Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider.
We have to prevent right-wing 
nationalism from creeping into 
Austria again, Hans Marschalek, 
head of the inmates association 
from Austrias Maiithausen concen
tration camp, told a cheering crowd 
of 30,0007 A banner hung from 
police barricades around the build
ing read Haider is Hitler.
Vienna police estimated 150,000 
people attended the main rally. It 
ended peacefully Saturday night 
after four hours.
The Ringstrasse, the main road 
around Vienna, was a sea of mostly 
hand-painted, colorful banners: 
Being ruled by the Freedom Party 
hurts our souls, Join in to help in 
the retention of human dignity, 
Austria, you mournful country, 
being ruined by black and blue 
hands. The latter slogan referred 
to the political colors of the 
Freedom Party and its coalition 
partner, the mainstream conserva
tive Peoples Party.
It is scandalous that racism and 
anti-Semitism have once again 
become harmless crimes, Ariel 
Muzicant, president of the local 
Jewish Community, told the crowd. 
It is a scandal that these crimes 
have been legitimized by the 
Peoples Party.
Anti-government rallies have 
become a near-daily practice in 
Vienna since the new government 
coalition took office Feb. 4.
The European Union, Israel and 
the United States have recently 
taken measures to isolate Austria 
diplomatically.
The outrage stems from Haiders 
opposition to immigration and rapid 
EU expansion, as well as previous 
statements praising some Nazi poli
cies. He has since apologized.
Dozens of anti-Haider protests 
have been held in other cities 
around Europe in recent weeks. In 
Paris on Saturday, up to 9,000 peo
ple demonstrated against the 
Austrian coalition.
Arafat critic is 
arrested again
JENIN, West Bank (AP)  
Palestinian police have again 
detained a professor who circulated 
a manifesto holding Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat responsible for 
corruption in his government, the 
detainees wife said Sunday.
Two police officers took Abdel 
Sattar Qassem from his home late 
- Friday in the northern West Bank 
town of Nablus, Amal Qassem said.
Palestinian police were not imme
diately available for comment.
The 56-year-old political science. 
professor was among 20 intellectu
als and politicians who signed the! 
petition in November that broke an' 
unspoken rule against criticizing1 
Arafat directly. Past corruption allegations had focused only on those ' 
around Arafat.
Several signatories recanted after! 
Arafat jailed some, put others under ' 
house arrest and threatened to lift' 
the legislative immunity of the law-, 
makers who signed it. Qassem spent, 
40 days in jail but was never, 
charged.
A few days after his release last, 
month, Qassem held a press confer-, 
ence accusing the Palestinian; 
Authority of stealing from his com-; 
puter a letter he had written to 
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
Qassem wrote in the letter, which 
was never sent, that not all 
Palestinians agree with Arafatspolicies in peace talks with Israel, 
his wife said.
Arafats critics say hundreds of 
millions of dollars in Palestinian 
Authority income are unaccounted  
for each budget year, including rev-; 
enues from the governments' 
monopoly on the import of cement' 
and fuel.
Arafats aides have said the mani
festo amounted to incitement.
Neither Qassems wife nor his 
lawyer have been allowed to see him 
since his most recent detention, 
Amal Qassem said.
She said that her husband called 
her Saturday from his jail cell in the 
West Bank town of Jericho and 
assured her that he was safe.

Campus works to end 
solicitations in dorms
SOLICITATION, page 3 
If a student sees a solicitor or 
solicitation that they think is inap
propriate they should call campus 
police or the student life office, 
said Crane.
Tracey Thompson, a sophomore 
majoring in communication 
design and a marketing represen
tative for bigwords.com, agrees 
that many of the recent measures 
conducted by some of the compa
nies had gone too far. It really 
feels like a violation of someones 
personal space....Its one thing to 
put up posters, but its another 
thing to go door to door. 
Thompson also had representa
tives from the hair salon coming 
to her dorm room in Morewood. 
It worried me, she said. I didnt
polite, but it was a lot of pressure 
to buy something right then. 
Thompson thinks that there are 
some measures that could be 
taken to prevent too many adver

campus advertising that became 
an issue. It might be useful to 
have bulletin boards just for solic

SDC has not yet contacted the 
companies that were involved in 
the door-to-door advertising. 
Crane said that the council did

promotion was over. However, 
Crane and SDC are prepared in 
case this ever happens again.

Warner and Cyert Halls are now. 
Plans to give Donner Hall a new

mentioned. The Hill area will be

also being discussed.
The area around Morewood is the 
focus of several future develop

fronting Forbes may be replaced by 
a new building that would provide 
student services and student orient
ed functions on the first floor with 
housing above that. However, the 
University is committed to keeping 
all 12 fraternities on campus, said 
Tellers.
The master plan aims to connect
the campus with the surrounding 
areas. Encouraging the develop
ment of commercial areas on Craig 
Street would help to create a college 
town environment. Ideas about a 
bike path have also been suggested.Ive heard rumors about a pedes
trian bridge to Craig Street being 
built; I think that would be helpful 
for students, said Jason Weill, a 
first-year CS student.
The plan is constantly evolving 
and there are lots of opportunities 
for people to be involved in the 
process, said Lamb. In addition to 
the monthly town meetings, stu
dents and faculty are encouraged to 
contact Lamb or Tellers with sugges

dont want any students to feel like 
they dont , have any options for 
transportation, said Fowler. The 
shuttle and escort have been heavi
ly used and now there is also the 
Port Authority service to help stu
dents with transportation needs, 
said Ricci.
Sometimes I have people drive 
or walk me home if its late, but 
otherwise I just walk. The problem 
with the shuttle and escort service 
is that it takes longer than walk
ing, said Phebe Taylor, a sopho
more music theater major.
Ricci said that many incidents 
that occur off-campus arent 
reported to the campus police. 
When they are reported, a crime 
alert is issued in order to warn and 
give recommendations to other 
students about the potential prob
lem.
Dana Mock, a junior history 
major, is an RA in off-campus hous
ing. She has been strongly encour
aging her residents to take advan
tage of the shuttle and escort sys
tem since her supervisor was 
recendy harassed on his way home 
to Marybelle Apartments.
I think there is a constant threat 
to students walking home at night 
to off-campus apartments. We are 
constantly reminded to enforce 
options such as escort to take stu
dents home at night, but unfortu
nately this is not always an effec
tive solution. Maybe we should 
insist on having a stronger campus 
police presence at these sites, 
specifically near Amberson 
Apartments and Cathedral 
Mansions and Marybelle, said 
Mock.
Campus Police and representa

Affairs, and Enrollment Services 
have been meeting every 
Wednesday since last spring to 
review previous incidents and

Crime and Incident Report
2/19 Theft - 6:30 am A campus police 
officer was dispatched to Donner Hall to investi
gate a theft report. The office had been 
informed that individuals were taking ping pong 
balls from the machine, which is attached to the 
Donner Hall attendant desk. Upon arriving, the 
officer disovered the machine with an 8x8 inch 
hole smashed in the side, with two balls inside of 
it and two balls on the floor. All of the other ping 
pong balls were unaccounted for. Also, the 
machine had written on it in black marker need 
something to smack with your paddle?-buy 
some ballz.
2/18 Medical - 2:32 pm A campus police 
officer and an EMS worker were sent to the UC 
to investigate a Dining Service employee who 
had been hit on the head by a 10 lb. box of pasta
and knocked unconscious for a few seconds. 
The employees supervisor reported that he had 
bent down to tie his shoe and bumped the shelv
ing unit where the food was kept. As he did this, 
a 10 lb. box of Roseli enriched Mafalda fell, strik
ing the employee on the head as he walked 
through the door. The victim was taken to 
UPMC Shadyside for head and neck pain.
2/11 Medical - 6:53 pm Campus Police 
received a call from the Purnell Center, request
ing medical attention for a student who had a 
screw in his finger. Upon arriving, the officer 
discovered the victim with a hole in his finger 
gained from operating a screw gun while work
ing on the set of the Chosky Theatre. There was 
no bleeding at the time of injury or at the time of 
the officers arrival. The victim was immediately transported by the officer to Shadyside 
Hospital Emergency room for treatment.

Wonder Boys showings 
limited due to finances
MOVIE, from page 1 
headed by Dawn Kezer, and Hale 
have worked closely to arrange for 
the showings. According to Kezer, 
CMU students got more than what 
they originally agreed to, which 
was just one showing. We 
thought it was a really good deal, 
said Kezer in regards to Paramount 
and National Amusements agree
ment to show the film twice. At one 
point, they were not going to do any. 
Theyre in the business to make 
money. She said this agreement is 
being done as a thank-you.
According to both Hale and Kezer, 
the University and the Pittsburgh 
Film Office have worked relentlessly 
to get Paramount and National 
Amusements to agree to further 
showings. [CMU] has done every
thing that they could for the stu
dents, as have we, said Kezer. I 
think its just big business. We wont 
quit trying. Kezer was preparing 
for a trip to Los Angeles this past
weekend and said that she would 
continue to press Paramount execu
tives for more screenings. I deal 
with the people who tell the distrib
ution company what to do, said 
Kezer. Paramount usually tells 
National Amusements what to do.
We, as Paramount, could not do 
that, said Delaney regarding the 
Universitys request for more than 
two showings. She said that the 
decision is coming from higher up. 
While Hale has made several, 
requests, Paramount has been 
unable to fulfill them.
Kezer said that her office had only 
recently become aware of students, 
continuing unhappiness over the 
agreement and her office is continu
ing to work with CMU and 
Paramount to try to come up with a 
more palatable agreement for CMU 
students. Representatives at 
Paramount Pictures headquarters 
in Hollywood could not be reached 
for comment.

POLICE, from page 1 
focusing their attention to this area, 
another fight broke out in front of 
Delta Tau Delta (DTD) as SAE mem
bers were returning to their house.
It was at this point that a CMU stu
dent was arrested. Pittsburgh police 
reported that as officers were break
ing up the second fight, another stu
dent attempted to interfere with an 
officer three times and was warned 
on each occasion. The officer said 
that the student began to approach 
him aggressively. At this point the 
K9, Benji, reacted and apprehended 
the student by attacking his upper 
left arm. The student was charged 
with disorderly conduct, failure to 
disperse, and obstruction of justice.
Another student was arrested for 
aggravated assault, resisting arrest, 
and disorderly conduct. According 
to Pittsburgh police, the student was 
swearing and confrontational to the 
officer. When asked to leave, the 
student lunged at the officer, who 
then took the student to the ground 
and handcuffed him.
One member of the DTD fraterni
ty, Dan Isaacs, a senior mathemati
cal sciences major, witnessed the 
incident from the front porch of his 
house. He claims that when mem
bers of SAE ran to Kap Sig, he went 
out on the DTD porch in order to 
warn his fraternity brothers of what 
was happening. Isaacs said that as 
he was standing on the porch with a 
friend from SAE attempting to find 
out what had happened to a friend, 
he was approached by a Pittsburgh 
police officer, asked to leave, 
pushed, and then hit in the head 
with a flashlight. According to 
Isaacs, when he realized he was 
bleeding, he sat down and was then 
handcuffed by a CMU officer.
Later the handcuffs were switched 
to city police cuffs, and Isaacs was 
taken to the Pittsburgh police wagon 
where he waited for an ambulance. 
According to Isaacs, he heard CMU
police and Pittsburgh police dis
cussing what to charge him with. The 
CMU police believed he was trying to 
flee the scene. I took three steps to sit * 
down. I was bleeding out of my 
head, said Isaacs. The Pittsburgh 
police then charged him with disor
derly conduct. He was issued a cita
tion and was taken to the hospital' 
where he received staples in his head.
Other students, who were on thescene but wish to remain anony-1 
mous, claim that they also saw> 
Isaacs and another student being hit 
by a flashlight and injured.
Isaacs said that the only reason he 
was on the porch was to attempt to 
get his brothers back into the build
ing and out of the way. He is unsure 
why the police felt threatened by him, 
and believes the charges to be unfair.,
Another member of DTD, who 
was on the scene and received a dis
orderly conduct charge, agreed with 
Isaacs that the force used by the 
Pittsburgh police officer seemed 
unnecessary. The fight is sec
ondary and stupid, and the CMU 
police handled the situation fine. 
My problem is with the excessive 
force used by the Pittsburgh police, 
said the DTD member.
The main concern on Saturday 
was community safety and the con
ditions of injured students. Now we 
can start investigating, said Fowler. <
In response to the comments of, 
excessive force, Fowler said that if, 
students were injured by police offi-. 
cers, he would hope that it was only 
done to restore peace and subdue 
aggression. Its hard to tell right, 
now, especially in a mob scene when 
many were in an intoxicated state. 
Hopefully, we will have a lot of eye-' 
witnesses, said Fowler.
Ricci said that, given the number of 
people involved and the danger of thesituation, all officers simply did what, 
was necessary to end retaliatipn.
At press time, no city officers from, 
the scene were available for comment.

Forum
21 February 2000THE TARTANResearch center must not divert resources from main campus
This semester CMU administrators 
announced a possible partnership with 
NASA to plan a new branch campus at 
the Ames Research Center in Silicon 
Valley. The branch campus, if estab
lished, will be a research facility utiliz
ing CMUs strengths in computer sci
ence and information technology. The 
center has many benefits, including 
increased exposure of Carnegie 
Mellons name, and more opportunities 
for students. However, the University 
should tread carefully, as the new part
nership could pose several difficulties.
One of the risks the school runs is 
poorly allocating tight resources. CMU 
has one of the smallest endowments for 
a university in its tier, which has been 
pointed out by President Jared Cohon 
on several occasions. Cohon, as well as 
alumni relations, must gauge whether 
opening a new branch in Silicon Valley 
will divert attention away from the 
Pittsburgh campus itself  alumni 
might choose to donate money exclu
sively to Silicon Valley. In addition, 
Cohon, who is partially responsible for 
raising money for the school, may divert 
his attention from fund-raising for the 
Pittsburgh campus in favor of Silicon 
Valley. To prevent this from happening, 
perhaps a portion of the money that 
goes towards the new branch would 
automatically go to Pittsburgh.
The new center will surely generate 
new opportunities for students in com
puter-related disciplines. However,
there has been no mention to date of 
additional opportunities for the rest of 
the CMU students that attend the center 
in fields such as professional writing, 
economics, or mechanical engineering. 
The administration must make sure it 
does not ignore these students. CS, for 
instance, is not a department that is 
clamoring for recognition. Other 
departments, such as Modern 
Languages, and the Mellon College of 
Science sorely need more resources and 
attention. Thus far, it seems the new 
center is targeted only at helping the 
computer sector of the University. Until 
a CMU Drama branch opens in 
Hollywood, or a business financial cen
ter opens in New York, the Silicon Valley 
branch should accomadate more than 
just the computer fields.
Professors might be enticed to leave the 
campus in favor of a temporary post at the 
new research center. A general rule 
should be that departments affected by 
faculty leaving should pay close attention 
to how classes and students will be affect
ed. If too much disruption occurs, and the 
quality of education declines, the depart
ment should reconsider allowing profes
sors to leave Pittsburgh.
Above all, the administration must 
make sure that the Silicon Valley ven
ture is really just a branch campus. 
Under no circumstances should the 
interests of the Pittsburgh campus, 
where the majority of students and fac
ulty live and work, be compromised.Computer Skills Workshop fails to meet needs of students
Carnegie Mellon University requires 
all undergraduates to take one class, 
Computer Skills Workshop (CSW). This 
class is meant to be universally helpful 
to all students who have to take it. 
Increasingly, CSW is failing to help the 
students who need the computer basics 
it is supposed to provide, and is useless 
for the students who possess these skills 
already. CSW faces the challenge of cre
ating a course that is useful to students 
who have computer experience and cov
ers the entire spectrum from beginner 
to extremely advanced. This challenge 
has become hard to meet, and it is time 
to restructure the way computer skills 
are taught at Carnegie Mellon.
Many students feel that Unix and 
Andrew skills are some of the most use
ful aspects of CSW, but are concerned 
that they are being emphasized less in 
the course. Students need to learn from 
CSW more than simple tasks for pro
grams like Microsoft Word and Excel. 
Students should also be trained on how 
to use computer programs and skills 
specific to the University and to their 
classes. For instance, in CS and ECE 
classes, Unix is necessary to run much 
of the software necessary for everyday 
coursework. Students should learn 
more practical applications like how to 
create dlists and where to send large 
print jobs. In addition, CSW teachers 
should emphasize the fact that there are
multiple ways of accomplishing many of 
the tasks they teach within various com
puter programs.
While the creation of the CSW 
Student Seminar Series, which allows 
students to further their computer edu
cation through a variety of workshops, 
is a positive step in the right direction, 
CSW itself is still in need of help. 
Perhaps these seminars could be avail
able as modules. If the University can 
use this modular approach to teaching 
CSW, students may stand to gain a lot 
more from the program. For instance, 
the University could require students to 
take four different modules, where two 
are centralized and required for all stu
dents. Some departments, such as 
Design, require specific computing 
skills. Thus, the third module could be 
specific to a departments needs. 
Students could choose from a list of top
ics to fulfill their fourth module. Such 
topics may include useful real-world 
applications such as QuarkXPress, 
Adobe Photoshop, and Microsoft 
Project.
Finally, a frequent complaint from 
some students is how easy CSW is. 
Perhaps some of the modules, espe
cially those specific to home depart
ments, could be tiered from beginning 
to advanced levels so students can 
take a version of CSW that is specific 
to them.

Letters to the Editor
MPAA violating rights?
Editor:
Laine Toweys article on the DVD soft
ware controversy indicated the complexity 
of the issues involved, but Im afraid some 
of the comments attributed to Associate 
Dean Paul Fowler may create a false 
impression among your readers. I hope 
you will allow me to give a clearer picture 
of the situation.
Currently available software DVD play
ers dont run under Linux, and wont play 
disks purchased in Europe or Asia. This 
restriction, known as region codes, 
allows the MPAA to sell the same content 
for less overseas, and to restrict access to 
content to specific geographic regions. 
Some countries refuse to require DVD play
ers to support region codes because they 
recognize this scheme as contrary to con
sumer interests. ' The US is not yet so 
enlightened. To remedy these problems, 
Linux enthusiasts are constructing their 
own DVD players which are open source 
and freely available to all. A necessary 
component of such players is a module to 
read encrypted DVDs. The source code for 
this module, called css-auth, is currently 
available on my Web site.
This has nothing to do with copying 
DVDs. For technical reasons, consumer 
copying of DVDs is presently uneconomi
cal. And large-scale commercial copying of
f .C.'I ~ v.VVDVDs by pirates in Asia is done with entire
ly different technologies that do not rely on 
decryption. Hence, the only practical use 
for the css-auth software is to play DVDs 
that have been legally purchased.
The Motion Picture Association of 
America alleges that css-auth is a circum
vention device whose distribution is pro
hibited under the Digital Millenium 
Copyright Act. The DMCA is a poorly con
structed law written by the industry itself, 
and has not yet been tested in the courts. It 
curtails some well-established rights of 
American citizens in order to advance the 
economic interests of a private cartel. But 
the DMCA cannot be used to suppress 
source code without doing violence to the 
First Amendment. Although the matter has 
not yet been reviewed by the Supreme 
Court, several lower courts have found that 
source code can indeed enjoy the same 
First Amendment protections as other 
forms of speech. The MPAAs attempt to 
interfere with speech it doesnt like should 
be rejected and roundly condemned.

Hillary Clinton embarks upon foolish Senate run
Sean Mintus
Hillary Rodham (pronounced roadham) Clinton inspires me. Rarely does 
there come along a person who has such 
poise, such chutzpah, such persistence. 
Someone who, against all odds, all misfor
tune, and all common sense, stands up in 
the face of adversity and proclaims I am 
going to ride this scorned-wife rap all the 
way to the Senate. Yep, all that and she 
still has the sharpest fashion sense this side 
of Janet Reno.
underprivileged, lower-class, white youth 
who lost his legs by stepping on a land 
mine on the way to church, Hillary and her 
photographers probably wont pay me any 
mind in the near future. I am, however, a 
Polish asthmatic, so theres still hope.
Now, her outlandish and eminently 
unsuccessful plot to salvage some shred of 
political dignity aside, I would love to 
know what this leggy Illinois blonde has to 
offer the Big Apples inhabitants. After all, 
theres no real reason to place in the 
Senate the mayor of New York, Rudy 
Guliani. Its not like he has cleaned up the 
city of New York and made it a livable, 
vibrant metropolis once again, all while his 
competition was busy standing by her
Ill swear on a pile of Communist Manifestos 
that if Hillary Clinton were a deceptive, prag
matic, manipulative individual responsible for 
the operation of a massive, presidential denial of 
fact, I would not vote for her.
I have taken her run for Senator of New 
York to heart. Thus, even though I have, 
since my entrance into this school, been a 
card-carrying H&SS scholar,. I have decid
ed to relocate to CIT, a faction of this col
lege that I have held in the highest esteem 
for so long, and to run for Student Senate.
Now, I have never resided in CIT before. 
I dont really know that much about it, and
I doubt that many of the people there 
would even like me very much, but when I 
shut my eyes real tight, I can genuinely see 
myself occupying an office in a college 
which, to this point, might as well have 
been located, say, I dont know, a couple of 
states away.
But seriously, am I the only one who fails 
to comprehend what this woman is think
ing? If given the opportunity, I would like 
to sit our first lady down and speak with 
her. However, seeing as how I am not an
man and discerning the correct size 
Yankee hat to don at her next press confer
ence.
If lthere is one thing that Hillary has 
going for her, however, it is her strength of 
character. I wont tell you why I would vote 
for her, but I will tell you why I wouldnt. 
Ill swear on a pile of Communist 
Manifestos that if Hillary Clinton were a 
deceptive, pragmatic, manipulative indi
vidual responsible for the operation of a 
massive, presidential denial of fact, I 
would not vote for her.
Honestly, if she so much as once con
vinced her husband, our beloved hornball 
of a president that he and his cabinet 
should deny a young interns allegations, 
and then went on Matt Lauers show to 
blame it all on right-wing (as opposed to 
wrong wing, I suppose) conspirators, 
knowing full well that the media would eat
it like a big collusion cake, I would certain
ly not vote for her.
Lucky for Hillary, she is not like that, and 
she never did any of those things.
So let us concentrate on what she has 
done. Lets see, while living in Arkansas, 
Hillary worked hard to increase state fund
ing for Arkansas Childrens Hospital. We 
will not discuss the fact that this institution 
was a major Clinton campaign contributor.
While living in our nations capital, the 
task of revamping our nations health care 
plan was given to our bright first lady by an 
even brighter president. Now, I dont have 
time to go into the intricacies of that 
bureaucratic debacle, but rest assured, she 
is to this day, still doing her best to raise 
the insurance premiums of children of 
working-class families.
When asked what she would focus on, 
would she be elected Senator, Rodham 
Clinton mentioned that she would like to 
ensure that the development of young 
minds would be a top priority. When asked 
if she had any specific plans for the city of, 
New York, Rodham Clinton declared that; 
the development of young minds would be 
a top priority. And when asked what she ; 
felt could be most improved upon by the 
state of New York, she announced that the 
development of young minds would be a j 
top priority.
Hence, I really see no reason not to vote: 
for out first lady. Is she still considered the j 
first lady? She might be the third or fourth 
for all we know. Anyway, so long as you do 
not value such outdated notions as hon
esty, reputable impetus, and common 
sense in your politicians, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton is the senator for you.
Back to the point! Vote Mintus for CIT i 
Senate in 2000! Im ready to go to bat for 
you guys and gals. And rest assured, ifj 
elected, this institution would no longer be 
just a university. It will be ... a village.

RU-486 presents new cultural problems
Blake Engel
Last Friday; RU-486, often 
referred to as the abortion pill, 
took another step toward approval 
when the Food and Drug 
Administration told the Population 
Council, a not-for-profit research 
group, that the drug is approvable.
The drug, already in use in 
Europe, is administered orally at an 
abortion clinic. It blocks the produc
tion of progesterone, 
which is needed to 
sustain the pregnan
cy. In a separate visit 
to the clinic, a drug 
called prostaglandin 
is administered, 
which ultimately 
causes the uterus to 
bleed and to expel 
the fertilized egg. A 
third follow-up visit 
is then required.
RU-486 is not the 
only medical abor
tion option avail
able; A drug called 
methotrexate has 
been available for some time. Yet, 
surgical abortions continue to be 
the most common form of abortion.
Medical abortions are commonly 
chosen for the one fewer visit to a 
clinic they require and their less 
intrusive procedures. However, they 
are less effective and often require a 
surgical abortion in the end. After a 
medical abortion, the woman 
watches the aborted fetus leave her 
body.
If approved, abortions could 
become markedly more accessible 
to women. Some would argue that 
an increase in the accessibility of 
abortions is needed, but the poten
tial cultural impact of such a change 
is an extremely undesirable one.
Since 1973 when Roe v. Wade 
legalized abortions, abortions have 
risen each year, peaking at 1.5 mil
lion abortions in 1993. Since then, 
abortions per year have declined to 
around 1.2 million per year, about
the population of Allegheny County.
Will RU-486 cause resurgence in 
abortions? Consider this: according 
to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an 
abortion rights research organiza
tion, teenagers commonly avoid 
abortions because of inaccessibility 
to abortion clinics. But because of 
the relative simplicity of administer
ing RU-486, more, abortion clinics 
would be able to stay afloat, thus 
creating a presence in areas current
ly without a clinic.
Some contend that such a change 
in accessibility is desirable, but 
there are direct consequences asso
ciated with such an increase.
For instance, the threat of sexualabortion as birth control. And if that 
birth control fails, STDs have a 
chance.
The Guttmacher Institute says 
young people ... are most likely to 
be single and to be involved in sexu
al relationships with more than one 
person over a short period of time. 
And to prevent the contraction of an 
STD, they recommend limit[ing] 
intercourse to one uninfected part
ner.
Using abortion as contraceptive 
represents a lack of responsibility to 
oneself, ones partner, and the con
ceived child.
Researchers are currently study
ing the use of microbicides - female

ly transmitted diseases (STDs) is 
very present on college campuses. 
Each year, there are 15 million new 
cases, with genital warts the most 
prevalent. Twenty-five percent of 
these new cases occur among 15 to
19 year-olds, and 42 percent among
20 to 24 year-olds.
These numbers would be even 
higher if  condom use had not 
increased significantly in the past 
years. However, easier abortions 
provide an easier approach to birth 
control.
The National Abortion Federation 
claims that increased accessibility 
has no bearing on contraceptive use. 
They claim women are not using 
abortion as a method of birth con
trol. Rather, it is used when people 
forget to use preventative contra
ceptives, or when those contracep
tives fail.
But if conception occurs and a 
woman chooses to end the pregnan
cy, she has, in fact, chosen to use

contraceptives able to kill microbes 
before they infect an individual. 
These STD prevention methods are 
still in test, and will take years to 
develop and get approved.
Even if they pass through the 
process and enter the market, there 
is no guarantee that their cultural 
impact will be a positive one. A 
world with significandy less risk of 
STD contraction allows less respon
sibility to our partners. Besides, new 
diseases spring up very quickly and 
could catch microbicide users off 
guard.
The Food and Drug 
Administration and Congress need 
to carefully consider the repercus
sions the use of RU-486. It may sati
ate Americans unending desire for 
rights, but it could put the entire 
population at severe risk.

LaRita Y. Hamilton
You would think that after a wave 
of high school shootings across the 
country, groups that promoted 
diversity and understanding would 
be welcome in our country. Thats 
apparently not so. Schoolyards are 
now turning into battlegrounds over 
gay-straight alliances  studentorganized clubs that promote the 
rights of gays, lesbians, and bisexu
als. Though there has been a rise of 
such groups for the past decade, 
there was a surge of the formation 
of the clubs after the 1998 beating 
and murder of college student 
Matthew Shepard.
Under the Federal Equal Access 
Act it is unlawful for schools to ban 
some extracurricular clubs if it 
allows others. It was actually 
Christian conservatives who pushed 
for its passage. The Federal Equal 
Access Act makes it legal for public 
schools to have faith-based organi
zations.
15-year-old Anthony Colin of El 
Modena High School in Orange 
County, California founded a GayStraight Alliance in order to pro
mote understanding and diversity 
on his campus. Rival schools in 
Orange County began to call the 
school Homodena and both anti
alliance and civil rights activists 
have flocked to the campus in order 
to protest or rally around the
selves or becoming violent, students 
like Colin are taking action. High 
school is already a difficult time 
without being harrassed for your 
sexual orientation. I would never 
justify a violent act against another 
person, but students who lash out 
are the students who feel that they 
have no one to turn to who will 
understand their feelings. Talking 
problems over with a group of peers 
is the perfect way to alleviate feel
ings of rejection and misunder
standing. Groups that are studentrun and that dont impose their 
beliefs and standards upon other 
students are what make high school 
a rich experience. Protesting groups 
that do not infringe upon the rights 
of others is wrong.
Some people are under the 
impression that the right to pick and 
choose is one of the provisions of 
the Federal Equal Access Act. The 
fact is, there are going to be some 
organizations that do not interest 
some students or that some parents 
object to.
In order prevent local schools 
from having alliances, a school 
board in Salt Lake City, Utah decid
ed to ban all extracurricular clubs. 
There is clearly no winner in this sit
uation. Now, not only are the stu
dents interested in forming an 
alliance prevented from meeting, 
the entire population of the school 
has had their right to meet with peo
ple with similar interests revoked.
Its very disturbing to me that 
people are holding their heads in
A group that provides students with an 
opportunity to share their feelings with 
one another should be more than welcome on any campus.
alliance.
Why do high school students 
resort to violence? It seems to me 
that these students are merely fol
lowing the examples of their elders. 
Colin was hit on the head by a 
demonstrator on the way to school. 
Time magazine reports that gay and 
lesbian youths are seven times as 
likely as straight kids to be threat
ened or injured by a weapon at 
school and five times as likely to 
skip school because they feel 
unsafe.
A group that provides students 
with an opportunity to share their 
feelings with one another should be 
more than welcome on any campus. 
Opponents of the club are more fix
ated on the sexual aspect of homo
sexuality rather than the fact that 
these alliances bring together both 
heterosexual and gay students. 
Arguments used against the forma
tion maintain that Gay-Straight 
Alliances will promote destructive 
lifstyles. Teaching teen-aged stu
dents to hate is destructive. 
Protesting groups that are about tol
erance and working together is 
destructive.
Campus violence occurs when 
students feel like they dont belong. 
Rather then retreating into them
their hands pondering what can be 
done to prevent school violence one 
minute and then the next they are 
willing to resort to violent actions 
and words because they dont 
approve of an extracurricular 
activity.
Instead of being rewarded for tak
ing action, students are finding 
themselves engaged in petty legal 
battles. The all-or-nothing approach 
seems to be the only truly fair solu
tion, but is it really? Taking one per
sons rights away strips everyones 
rights along with it.
I can only hope that those parents 
that are so strongly oppose to GayStraight Alliances realize that they 
are only hurting their own children. 
By opposing these measures to pro
mote understanding they are teach
ing their kids to hate and that toler
ance really isnt important.
Hopefully, the controversy in El 
Modena will die down, but 
undoubtedly the same problem will 
arise elsewhere. Tolerance is some
thing that can be taught and I hope 
that people would just stop fighting 
it.

Tartan women fall short against record-setting Washington
BASKETBALL, from page 10 
Washington was able to put togeth
er a few effective possessions, going 
on a 6-0 run. The Tartans, however, 
gradually fought back to tie the 
score at 15-15 with seven minutes 
remaining in the half. Again, the 
Bears jumped out to a lead, 20-15, 
a quick run. And once again, 
artans fought back to keep it
.close, bringing the score to 20-19 in 
favor of the Bears at the 2:25 mark 
of the first half. The energy of the 
raucous crowd seemed to be rub
bing off on the the women during 
their tenacious scoring runs.
Nevertheless, Washington was 
not yet finished for the half. The 
Bears stormed into halftime with a 
9-2 run that brought their lead to
29-21, a fairly difficult deficit for 
Carnegie Mellon to overcome 
against such a tremendous oppo
nent. At halftime, Alia Fischer had 
scored nine points and grabbed five 
rebounds for the Bears, while the 
Tartans biggest contributor was 
Kara Coval with eight points and 
five rebounds.
The second half began with
Matt Brun/Special Projects Manager
Womens basketball coach Gerri Seidl looks on as first-year guard Michelle Sodini looks for a cutter in last Fridays wellattended game versus Washington University. Washington won, getting its NCAA-record 61st consecutive victory.
another effective Washington push, 
a 13-6 scoring span in which the 
Bears capitalized on six Tartan 
turnovers. The up-tempo offensive 
style of the Bears and the all-around 
inside play of Fischer continued to 
pound the Tartans further into their 
deficit. At the 12:35 mark of the sec
ond half, the Bear lead had bal
looned to 42-27, the biggest lead of 
the game. Almost midway through 
the second half, the once-boisterous 
home crowd had been all but 
silenced.
Carnegie Mellon didnt fare well 
the rest of the half. After the Tartans 
cut the deficit to 11 points at the 
9:43 mark, Washington went on a 
9-0 run to put the game out of reach 
for their opponents.
The game ran scoreless for almost 
three minutes with 6:20 remaining, 
but the Bears eventually resumed 
their barrage to push the lead into 
the 20s for the rest of the game. The 
final score of the contest was 61-38 
in favor of the Bears. Fischer, with
22 points and 11 rebounds, and 
Tasha Rodgers, with 13 points and 4 
steals, turned in excellent perfor
mances for the Bears, while Coval 
finished a strong night with 10 
points and seven rebounds for the 
Tartans.
When time ran out, the 
Washington team celebrated the
record-setting victory by exchang
ing hugs and congratulations for 
one another. No wild celebration, 
such as carrying someone off the 
court or dumping water on the 
coach, ensued. The Washington 
players and coaches retained their 
reticent manner after the game, 
downplaying the significance of the 
game itself and offering a modest 
amount of praise for one another.
We treated it just like any other 
game, said Rodgers.
When this first started up we 
didnt talk that much about it, 
Washington Head Coach Nancy 
Fahey said. But when we reached 
60 and now 61,1 wanted this group 
of kids to experience it. I do think it 
is a unique and special group.
The Carnegie Mellon players and 
coaches offered praise for the 
Washington team.
They are a very well-coached 
team, Carnegie Mellon head coach 
Gerri Seidl said. They know your 
offense inside and out and have 
very good post players. They were 
the difference.
The Tartans also acknowledged 
the enjoyment they felt from the 
presence of the multitude of Tartan 
supporters.
That was awesome. That was so 
much fun, Coval said about the 
crowd. Usually the supporters con
sist of athletes and roommates, but 
it was different this time. Everybody 
seemed to be there.
Seidl also recognized the crowd, 
saying, Because of the students, 
faculty, and staff, there was a real 
excitement in the gym. We really 
appreciated it.
After the excitement of Fridays 
game, the Tartans practiced on 
Saturday to prepare for their next 
game, which was yesterday, against 
the University of Chicago.
The teams stifling defense held 
Chicago to 29 percent shooting for 
the game and forced 24 turnovers. 
Junior guard Lauren Petruzzi rang 
up 11 points, four steals, and three 
assists in 30 minutes of play, leading 
all players in those areas.
The Tartans won, 52-37, despite.a 
scoring drought of six minutes in 
the second half, thanks to a strong 
first half of play. During the game, 
the Tartans trailed only once, for 
one minute midway through the 
first half.
Center Kara Coval contributed 
nine points and ten rebounds, while 
guard Michelle Sodini added ten 
points, six rebounds, and two 
assists.
The Tartan women (14-10 over
all, 9-6 in UAA games) head to

Rodmans encore: at least another half-season of distractions
RODMAN, from page 10 
teams are bruising their index fin
gers working the phone lines before 
the trade deadline, trying to make a 
deal that will elevate them to the 
stature of the well-stocked Western 
Conference. Yes, we know that 
Michael Jordan is gone and a team 
from the West won the title last 
year. We got it. And still more tales 
of Jordan taking over the 
Washington Wizards and treating 
Wizards rookie Laron Profit to a 
game of one-on-one.
All right, so Michael isnt really 
gone, so heres yet another reason 
we should continue to tune in and 
watch the NBA. Dont touch that 
dial, kiddies.
The breathless way this message 
^delivered by the media and league 
spokespersons, night after night, is 
what makes Rodman so appealing 
tome.
; Rodman joined the Dallas 
Mavericks last week only after being 
turned down by every other team in 
the league, and only after complet
ing his obligation to throw a killer 
Super Bowl party. He moves into 
new owner Joe Cubans guest 
house. He negotiates a deal that will 
pay him the league minimum, and 
that also reportedly stipulates that 
he wont have to practice if he does
nt want to. A stationary bicycle 
stands ready, and the leagues pub
lic relations team paces back and 
forth nervously.
Meanwhile, Rodman goes out and 
does what he does best.
He rebounds. He defends. He 
gets tossed in the second game he 
plays with the Mavericks against 
Milwaukee after protesting an ille
gal defense the Bucks were running 
and didnt get called for. Rodman 
received a technical for arguing 
with the refs and then got ejected 
after walking to the opposite foul 
line and sitting down on the court in 
protest. Okay, so maybe weve seen 
this before, too.
Last year Rodman signed with 
the Lakers in mid-season and his 
circus act lasted only 23 games 
before the team cut him for being a 
distraction. Indeed, everywhere 
Rodman has gone in the league he 
has created a stir. But thats what 
Im finding so appealing right now 
as were caught in the doldrums of 
winter sport. Rodman speaks to me 
in a way that Tim Duncan and Karl 
Malone cant.
I told the referee, Why dont 
you kick me out for a reason? Let 
me hit somebody first. Thats a 
good reason. Dont kick me out 
because I sit down/  Rodman said 
of his ejection. Ive been a marked 
man for years. Nobody else in the 
league would have gotten kicked 
out for that.
Funny, but I dont see anyone 
else in the league even thinking of 
doing that! It seems to me that 
Rodman would be the only player 
who might get away with it. 
Everyone else plays basketball, 
while Rodmans mind is on other 
things. Like challenging NBA com
missioner David Stern to a 
wrestling match, which Rodman 
did after being ejected.
I expect David Stern is going to 
do something, but I dont give a 
damn, Rodman said. Me and 
David Stern need to clear our differ
ences. Like I said ... lets go into 
the ring. He gets naked, I get naked, 
and lets go in and get it on, broth
er.
Now who wouldnt want to see 
that?
Okay, so I wouldnt, either. But 
its a highly original idea, Ill give 
Rodman that much. Still, perhaps 
what intrigues me the most about 
Rodmans return to the NBA is the 
possibility  unlikely though it 
may be  of Rodman playing the 
rest of the year without incident, 
neglecting to add to his career total 
of 23 ejections while pulling down a 
ridiculous number of rebounds 
instead, and inspiring his new 
teammates with his tenacity and 
hustle.
What would be truly different is if 
Rodman bucks his career-long trend 
of being a parasitic personality, 
proving his critics wrong and going 
out a winner. Now, wouldnt that be 
something?
But, would it be as fun to watch?
What Colt Foutz really wants to see 
is the Pirates win a World Series, 
Foosball become an Olympic Sport, 
and the streets of Pittsburgh close per
manently for running trails. Oh yes, 
and for pigs to fly, too.

at least another half-season of distractions
I Column As I See
by Colt Foutz
Em
Call me crazy, but Im finding it hard not to like 
Dennis Rodman these days.
Thats right. Dennis Rodman. The Worm. The 
Weird One. The man who is to rebounding and 
multi-colored hair and tattoos and redundant jer
sey numbers and cross-dressing and stationary 
biking and cameraman-kicking, what former 
teammate Michael Jordan is to winning champi
onships.
Carmen Electras better half.
Before the Dallas Mavericks picked up Rodman 
off the Super Bowl party circuit a couple weeks 
ago, the sports world was looking a little bleak to 
me. Maybe we as sports fans have been just a lit
tle bit spoiled lately. Or a lot. Take a look at . 
what weve witnessed in the past year.
When we wanted a reprise of the great 1998 
home run race, Mac and Sammy were only too 
happy to oblige, and this time without the 
andro. When we thought the Broncos would
in the World Cup as 80,000 spectators screamed 
their approval. And even when we didnt think it 
was possible, we became stunned witnesses to 
the triumph of medicine and the healing power of 
the human spirit as Lance Armstrong, cancer sur
vivor, won the most grueling bicycle race in the 
world at the Tour de France.
So, maybe its no wonder that the sports world 
today seems to suffer a little in comparison. After 
all, its only been three weeks since maybe the 
greatest Super Bowl ever was played. But I think 
its been a long three weeks.
Call me impatient after you call me crazy, but 
the sports news items Ive been coming across 
lately just havent captured my imagination the 
way a McGwire home run or an Agassi return 
does.
Everyone else plays basketball, 
while Rodmans mind is on 
other things, like challenging
nothing if they dont trade him where he wants to 
go? Hm, that hasnt happened since, oh, last year, 
with Roger Clemens pulling the same stunt with 
the Blue Jays.
Congratulations though, Cincinnati, lets hope 
you really can lock him up for the next ten years 
so you dont experience what Seattle is feeling 
right now.
Everywhere were seeing the same old story 
played out in front of our eyes, only with differ
ent characters playing the roles. Mariano 
Rivera turns down $9 million before salary arbi
tration and ends up only getting $7 million, 
which means hell only double his salary from 
last year after quadrupling it the year before. 
But hell have another chance next year. 
Everywhere, reruns. Jazz forward Karl Malone 
_ continues to display his unparalleled ability 
to make five contrasting statements all with
in the same quote. Mercenary agent Scott 
Boras airs his opinion on ESPN radio that 
fifth-year player Alex Rodriguez is an up
coming legend and should be paid like it. 
The XFL is added to the ever-expanding listnever be usurped as champions again and the 
NFL was becoming as top heavy with haves 8F T LANNECC7D77IL SA A of alternative sports leagues. Setting aside
lording over the have-nots as baseball, the the recent cases against Ray Lewis and John
whole league did a Popeye impression and WT'C.StliTLQ TTldtch Rocker  both morbidly fascinating, if not
gave us Kurt Warner and the Rams sucking & utterly depressing  the sports news of the
down spinach and beating the Titans in the
Super Bowl.
When we wanted out-of-this-world consisten
cy, we looked to golf and Tiger Woods winning 
six straight tournaments. When we wanted a 
comeback story to be inspired by, we saw Andre 
Agassi resurrecting his tennis career with three 
Grand Slam championships. When we wanted a 
convincing argument that womens sports could 
captivate the nation as much as mens, we 
watched the U.S. soccer teams shootout victory
So Ken Griffey has signed with his hometown 
Cincinnati Reds? ^side from local merchants 
jumping the gun and printing up truckloads of 
#24 jerseys before Griffey had a chance to hold a 
press conference and let us know he was wearing 
#30, his Dads old number with Reds, theres 
nothing about this story that we havent heard 
before. Superstar player nears the end of his con
tract and holds his team hostage with a list of 
demands while threatening to leave them with
past few weeks has been nothing if not 
achingly familiar.
Until Rodman.
This, just when I thought Id be subjected to 
four more months of how Tim Duncan keeps 
sneaking up on the opposition. Okay, Duncans 
probably the best player in the game, but hes 
got the personality of a sweat sock. We got it.

Women outplayed in 
Bears record victory
Matt Brun/Special Projects Manager
Center Kara Coval forces her way through the paint and to the basket during 
Friday's game against Washington.
by Damian Olesnycky
7RAE/L oSD44iLESHL
Last Friday evening, an enthusi
astic mass of Carnegie Mellon stu
dents and supporters packed Sldbo 
Gymnasium to watch the Womens 
Basketball team take on the sub
stantial task of facing the 
Washington University Bears, who 
were tied with the NCAA all-divi
sions record of 60 consecutive wins 
in womens basketball. In the min
utes before tip-off the capacity 
crowd of 1,085 generated an elec
tric atmosphere of uninhibited 
school spirit, one that seldom 
emerges at Tartan athletic contests. 
Many of the cheering students bore 
items appropriate for an exciting 
sporting event, such as homemade 
signs, body and face paint, kilts, 
and many other forms of Tartan 
paraphernalia.
The setting of the game con
tributed to the buzzing atmosphere 
as well; the walls of the gymnasium 
were adorned with posters display
ing messages of encouragement
and appreciation for the Tartans, 
and several commercial camera
men and photographers could be 
seen around the court. Skibo truly 
took the form of a clash between a 
couple of major college basketball 
programs in both look and spirit.
The game began with the Bears 
controlling the tip-off. Carnegie 
Mellon started out playing strong, 
scoring the first basket of the game 
and stopping the Bears on their first 
three possessions, to the delight of 
the capacity crowd. The stingy 
defensive play of both teams result
ed in many stifled possessions early 
on.
Just over five minutes into the 
game, the Tartans held a 10-9 lead, 
highly attributable to Amy Novaks 
two points, two assists, and three 
rebounds. This gritty tempo favored 
the Tartans, who ran mostly slower 
half-court offensive sets, rather 
than the quick fast breaks that the 
Bears pushed offensively.
In the ensuing minutes of the 
game, the score seesawed. 
Following the early Tartan lead,

After brief high, Tartan men drop two
by Nathan Steinwald
9/ASLEWRSEA6 52ES/L
After winning two straight games 
for the first time this season, the 
mens basketball team returned to 
its home court only to lose two 
straight.
The losses came at the hands of 
two of the best teams in the 
University Athletic Association  
Washington University (16-7 over
all, 9-4 in the UAA) and the 
University of Chicago (20-3,14-0). 
The games were not only chances to 
salvage some pride as the season 
winds down, but also the last 
chances for the Tartans to win at 
home, something they have not 
done all season.
In Fridays Washington game the 
opening minutes started out well 
for the Tartans. After falling behind 
8-12, they called a 20-second time
out and came back -and traded the 
lead with Washington for a few pos
sessions.
That, however, did not last. CMU 
took the lead at 18-17, but for the 
remaining nine and a half minutes
of the first half they were outscored 
18-10. The Tartans missed 9 of 14 
shots in that time period, including 
open shots and lay-ups, and had 
several shots blocked.
Washington wasnt putting on a 
shooting clinic either, though they 
did shoot well from three-point 
range. The second half did not start 
out well for CMU. Washington 
scored the first seven points of the 
half to stretch their lead to 14, and 
didnt look back after that. CMUs 
shooting percentage fell further, 
and they couldnt keep pace with 
Washington. The Tartans had more 
shots blocked, and turned the ball 
over nearly twice as many times as 
Washington.
All in all, the game was poorly 
played. The pressing defense seen 
at the beginning of the season was 
not used as much, and the offense 
continued to struggle, making it 
very difficult for CMU to think of 
winning. Sophomore Dom Ionadi 
led the team in scoring for the third 
game in a row, finishing with 18 
points, and sophomore Matt 
Beaujon led the team in rebounds 
with 12. He was also second on the
team in scoring with 10 points.
The University of Chicago game 
was also senior day for the Tartans, 
as they played their last home game 
of the season at Skibo Gym and the 
last home game of Chris Butskos 
career. Butsko has been hampered 
by a knee injury all season that had 
kept his playing time down. 
However, on Sunday he played 28 
minutes and finished with nine 
points and four rebounds.
Unfortunately for Butsko, 
Sundays game against the 
University of Chicago started out 
and finished in a manner very simi
lar to Fridays game. CMU even 
enjoyed a three-point lead with the 
score at 20-17 in the first half, but 
things quickly disintegrated from 
there. With only six and a half min
utes left the team surrendered the 
lead and scored only two more 
points in the half.
At the half, the score was 22-30 
in favor of the University of 
Chicago. Like Washington 
University, Chicago was not inter
ested in relinquishing its lead. In 
the first five minutes of the second 
half, the Tartans saw their deficit
swell to as much as 17 points. 
Sophomore guard Jim Abel picked 
up a technical foul for shoving a 
Chicago player, an act that he told 
the referees was motivated by being 
struck in the groin by the same 
Chicago player.
The incident had little effect on 
the outcome of the game, which the 
Tartans lost, 68-46. The Tartans 
were simply outmatched, and it 
wasnt long before Chicago began 
looking deeper onto its bench to 
give people playing time. CMU fin
ished the game with only 33.3 per
cent shooting and 18.2 percent 
shooting from three-point range.
Once again they turned the ball 
over nearly twice as many times as 
they tallied assists. No player fin
ished in double digits in either 
rebounds or points.
Yesterdays defeat, coupled with 
Fridays loss to Washington, 
brought CMUs record to 3-21 over
all and 2-12 in the UAA. The 
Tartans last game of the season will 
be away at Emory University, 
another UAA team, which beat the 
Tartans 52-44 the last time they 
met earlier this year.

Balm in Gilead successfully debuts in new Chosky Theatre
by Beth Powell
7RAE/L oSD44iLESHL
Balm in Gilead by Lanford Wilson opened this 
past Friday in the Philip Chosky Theatre, the new 
450-seat main stage theatre in the Purnell Center 
for the Arts. The show is a wonderful display of the 
innovation of Carnegie Mellons Drama 
Department and the technological capabilities of 
the new theatre.
The show has drugs, alcohol, sex, whores, drug 
dealers, bums, lesbians, male-types who are much 
more comfortable with their feminine side, lots of 
coffee, and even some trick-or-treaters. What more
could one ask for in a play?
When you walk into the theatre, you wonder if 
the show is really ready to go on. The actors and 
crew members are just hanging out, you can see all 
the way through the backstage doors, and there 
are various pieces of the set and some theatre 
equipment scattered around the stage. Then, sud
denly, the lights dim a little, the music starts, and 
the cast and crew put the set together before the 
audiences very eyes. You are transported to a cof
fee shop on the Upper West Side in New York City, 
as it was in October 1967.
The play is based on hours and hours that 
Wilson spent in just such a coffee shop, observing 
the people who passed through and spent their
lives there. The characters are the people that you 
and most others would avoid when passing them 
in the street, but these people are portrayed as 
normal, with lives, feelings, and problems that 
everyone can relate to. They were searching for 
their respective places in life, even though they 
were the bottom rung on societys ladder. In the 
end, they were just as human as we are.
The play seems to show how repetitious every
day life really is. In another perspective, Balm in 
Gilead also resembled many stories that tell the 
dismal tales of drug addicts floating through life, 
subsisting in the comfort that each day will be no 
different from the next. Yet at the same time, it 
was a powerful commentary on how quickly life
can change when your entire existence is depen
dent upon feeding a drug addiction. Whether it be 
promiscuous crack-head women, nervous dealers, 
or the shaking burn-outs without any grasp on 
reality-the lifestyle of an Upper East Side heroine 
addict was a tortourous existence. Of course, the 
pain would never be enough to look for a way out, 
perhaps because that option never existed, a sadly 
accurate observation that writer Lanford Wilson 
observed nearly every day of his life in Manhattan.
The pressure was on for director Jed Allen 
Harris, a senior lecturer in directing here at 
Carnegie Mellon, to deliver, and he did. There are 
disturbingly-real portrayals of drug addicts,

Tony-award winning Titanic 
premieres at Benedum Center

Released the same year as 
the blockbuster film Titanic, 
Broadways Titanic: A New 
Musical may have been over
shadowed -a bit by its recordbreaking cousin. Nevertheless,
dreamed about making it big in 
America. Eventually, the social 
inequality issue started to 
become tedious. Fortunately, 
Titanics remarkable musical 
numbers compensated for its 
sluggish plot. The shows Tonywinning score made bitter
sweet or even sad moments feel

Cast of Broadway musical
the production became an 
enormous success, winning 
heaps of critical praise and five 
Tony awards, including Best 
Musical. Now on a national 
tour, Titanic: A New Musical 
came to the Benedum Center 
Friday night for a performance 
every bit as grand and epic as 
its legendary namesake.
For much of Act One, the 
audience may have wondered 
what all the fuss was about. 
Early on, the plot focused pri
marily on establishing differ
ences between the classes of 
people on the Titanic. While 
the first-class passengers 
enjoyed' elegant dinners with 
the captain, the second-class 
passengers aspired to mingle 
with the boats millionaires and 
the third class passengers
courtesy Marcus Chait
bESDAEya performed Friday night at Pittsburghs Benedum Center
composer Maury Yestons soar
ing arrangements.
Titanics inevitable collision 
with an iceberg marked the end 
of the first act; following the 
intermission, the musical really 
hit its stride. From the begin
ning of Act Two, when the pas
sengers are awakened, until the 
final scene with Titanics sur
vivors, the performance was 
compelling and almost without 
a dull moment. Author Peter 
Stone wisely shifts attention 
away from the privileged class 
monopoly of the lifeboats, a sit
uation with social implications 
that might have detracted from 
the performance. In addition, 
Stone is able to introduce a 
rather large number of charac
ters, enabling him to bring out
the various shades of .despair 
and hope of those faced with 
their doom.
With such a big cast, it was 
difficult for any of the players 
to really steal the show. As 
Captain E.J. Smith, William 
Parry is the closest thing 
Titanic has to a lead, but the 
real star of the performance is 
its no-expensespared production. 
Particularly 
impressive was the 
stage design; welldeployed back
drops and lighting 
allowed for lots of 
quick scene
changes, which let 
the audience keep 
track of what was 
going on all over 
the ship. This 
aspect of the musi
cal was integral to 
the second act, 
given the amount 
of action com
pressed into the 
limited time frame 
of Titanics sinking.
Titanic: A New Musical has 
been so successful because it 
offers something for almost any 
fan. The show achieves a good 
balance between comedy and 
drama, dialogue and music, 
and fact and fiction, wrapping 
the whole performance up in 
the epic packaging one would 
expect from something named 
Titanic. Admittedly, the 
musical was less than interest
ing early on, and seemed rather 
aimless prior to the run-in with 
the infamous iceberg. 
However, the performance 
rebounded very well for the 
second half, and delivered a 
lively, energetic show that 
might even make James 
Cameron a little bit envious.
CMU: Actively involved campus 
or group of apathetic zombies?
Less Stress? 
by Emily Landes
Much has been said of the apathy which exists here 
at CMU. Many of our organizations are in a constant 
struggle to get and keep members. Those running for 
Student Senate often do so unopposed. The atten
dance for Master Plan meetings, which will shape the 
future of CMU, only half fills McConomy.
But our apathy goes deeper than simple communi
ty non-involvement. As long as it doesnt involve 
them directly, nobody seems to care what anyone 
else is doing. If you walk across campus screaming, as 
I do occasionally, nobody stops and asks if you are 
okay, or even stares at you. They simply shrug their 
shoulders and keep soldiering.
There is one issue, however, which excites almost 
every member of this seemingly uncaring university. 
Whenever it is discussed, it never fails to elicit a 
response of some kind. And it is our incessant pursuit 
of and fascination with this one thing that I believe is 
the root of our apathy in all other endeavors. If I may 
paraphrase one of our generations most famed 
poets: Here at Carnegie Mellon, its all about the
Benjamins, baby. In other words, we are obsessed 
with money: who is making it, how they are doing it, 
and how we can make some of our own.
Of course, this phenomenon is not only limited to 
our institution. It used to be that people graduated 
college, got a job, and slowly worked their way up 
through their company until they were comfortable 
enough to retire. But now, there is no reward for com
pany loyalty, no gold watch. And so more and more 
people are working for themselves, with mixed 
results. But of course, who hears about all those start
ups that fail? As far as we know, if you havent 
become a millionaire by age 30, there must be some
thing wrong with you.
Living in this era of skys-the-limit startups, run by 
27-year-old millionaires in ripped jeans, the fear has 
been firmly implanted in our young brains: Everyone 
is getting rich except me. Money has more control 
over us than it ever did, just because there seems to 
be such an overabundance of it, right within our 
reach. Issues like homelessness, welfare, fading 
opportunities for those in blue-collar fields, and an 
increased reliance on part-time employees who work

all those start-ups that fail miser
ably, we push these issues out of 
our public discourse.
So, if these issues do not get us 
up in arms, then what does? I find 
it quite telling that in my nearly 
three years at this university I 
have never seen more public out

additional profits for getting their

and several already have. Some 
have even been lured into drop
ping out of school or leaving early 
in order to jumpstart their earn
ing potentials. Of course, some 
majors are being wooed more 
than others. Just look at the dif
ferences in company turn-out for 
the BOC and the TOC versus the 
H&SS Job Fair.
I think that this disparity in 
career opportunities, and thus 
future wealth, is the reason for 
many of the misconceptions about 
workload at this school. Think
about it, who do we perceive as 
having to do the most work? I 
would venture that the answer is 
computer science, engineering, 
and perhaps business majors. And 
who do we perceive as making the 
most money after graduation? 
Again, I would say that the answer 
is computer science, engineering, 
and business majors.
I wonder how our perceptions 
would change if computer scien
tists were expected to make about 
25K per year, and philosophy 
majors were being courted by 
companies offering free cars, a
---------------- starting salary of
60K, with signing 
bonuses and stock 
options. I predict 
that we would see a 
starding increase in 
the respect that we 
all have for the work 
of philosophy 
majors.
This is the point 
that we have 
reached. What peo
ple do is not as 
s how much theyimportant 
make. As such, it is not so surpris
ing that we arent more involved 
with the community. After all, 
there are no financial incentives to 
joining an organization, running 
for a student office, or even asking 
someone why or what they are 
screaming about. And thus, what 
students appear to be saying is, 
Whats the point?

Human calculator mystifies audience 
with his mathemagical abilities
by Blake Engel .
IHLU/AAHn 8DAD6HL
Dr. Art Benjamin could school 
you. That is, unless you can 
remember strings of sixteen 
digits, fill in magic squares, and 
multiply four-digit numbers. All 
in your head.
How does Dr; Benjamin do all 
this? Its in your tie! quipped 
one of the audience members, 
referring to the Doctors kitschy 
calculator-pattern tie.
Benjamin wowed the audi
ence when he asked for their 
birthdays, upon which he 
promptly named the day of the 
week their birthdays fell on. All 
the while, he had a volunteer 
search through a binder of cal
endars for verification. Not sur
prisingly, the volunteer took 
much longer than Benjamin did 
to find the right day.
Spectators shouted out 
threeand four-digit numbers 
for him to multiply, which he 
did with remarkable efficiency. 
He does all multiplication from 
left to right, not vice-versa, as 
was learned in elementary 
school.
To recognize when a number 
has a zero in it is key, he notes. 
Factors of ten are much easier 
to multiply. He also takes 
advantage of factorization to 
multiply: I will always look for 
a feature in the problem that I 
can exploit.
One person named 729 as a 
factor, and Benjamin respond
ed, Which of course is 3 to the 
sixth, but I wont take advan
tage of it. His sense of humor 
was almost as entertaining as 
his skill.
Squaring large numbers also 
presents little difficulty. He 
demonstrated how to square
Lisette Miller-Dixon/Cohlributing Editor
Dr. Art Benjamin astounds his audience by showing how to calucuate any
thing from square roots to large digit multilication and factorization
large numbers using quadratic 
principles. He did each problem 
without more than a seconds 
hesitation.
When asked how he does his 
tricks, he said magicians dont 
share their secrets so people 
dont leave saying that was 
dumb! But because of the 
sophisticated audience, he 
shared many of his secrets.
To memorize numbers, he 
uses what he calls a phonetic 
code. There is an accepted 
alphabet for each digit; for 
instance, 1 is represented with 
a T or D sound, 2 with N, 
and so on. With these conso
nants, he puts the characters 
end to end and mentally fills in 
vowels, creating a word to
remember and not a number.
He then recites the words in 
his head repeatedly, later to 
decode their consonants into 
their original numbers.
His skill, Benjamin says, is a 
very auditory process. If he 
were given the numbers on 
paper, he would have to pro
nounce the numbers out loud to 
fully understand them.
Benjamin graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon in 1983, and 
has done work with Bill Chase 
to disprove the old belief that 
human brains can only remem
ber seven digits (give or take 
two) at once. Since then he has 
been a professor at Harvey 
Mudd College in Claremont, 
California.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 21, 2000
Balm in Gilead suceeds
CHOSKY, from page LI 
whores, drug dealers, and bums. 
Everyday life is all these people 
have. The various conversations 
and actions that all go on at the 
same time are extremely well 
choreographed and they 
enhance the realistic qualities of 
the show. For the most part, the 
cast,., made up of undergraduate 
students from Carnegie Mellons 
drama program, did a great job. 
Victor Quinazs performance as 
Dopey was especially convincing 
and his witty narrations were 
extremely entertaining. Pay 
close attention when he wakes 
up after passing out on the bar 
stools.
The new theatre, which was 
named in honor of Philip 
Chosky, is equipped with stateof-the-art capabilities for sound, 
lighting, and staging. The audi
ence became very aware of these 
capabilities as soon as the show 
started and the set was built. 
The windows, which are the 
most interesting part of the set 
and were brought in smoothly,
as are the curtains, if one even 
noticed their appearance.
The lighting changes appeared 
to be effortless and the quality of 
sound, with all the different con
versations happening at the 
same time and music in the 
background, was amazing. 
Interestingly enough, music 
selection ranged a great deal, 
even including Nirvanas Smells 
Like Teen Spirit as part of the 
finale. Maybe it was a way of 
connecting this play with many 
of the equally disturbing lifestlyes that continue to permeate in 
many aspects of modern day 
society. Thus, the play conclud
ed in a powerful explosion of 
truth.
In addition to an astounding 
opening night, Balm in Gilead 
will be performed in the Philip 
Chosky Theatre February 22-26. 
The performances begin at 8 pm 
with a matinee on February 26 
at 2 pm. For tickets or more 
information, the Drama box 
office can be reached at (412) 
268-2407.
Performers at UC Berkeley discuss dramatic art
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. Ask any 
non-Californian to name the first things that 
come to mind when they hear the word 
Berkeley, and they might answer: hippies 
and hard sciences. But what about drama and 
dance? 
While the UC Berkeley theater arts commu
nity may not be one of the campus crown jew
els, sophomore Jonathan Whittle-Utter says 
the dramatic art department is going no place 
but up, and deserves recognition accordingly.
From what Ive heard we are in an upward 
swing right now, Whittle-Utter says. Theres 
a great deal of talent and a great deal of tenac
ity (in the department).
An accomplished actor and director, WhittleUtter says he expects to end up directing, per
forming or producing five or more student 
productions this semester alone. That, he says, 
is all due to the dramatic art departments 
tight-knit environment and endless opportuni
ties.
Its so non-conservatory, Whittle-Utter 
says, adding that the curriculum at prestigious 
drama conservatories is virtually planned out 
for students. The structure at this department 
really fosters an independent drive for selfimprovement; it becomes very much a thing of 
student choice. The fact that theres a lot of 
student theater going on is indicative of that.
Saying that there is a lot of student theater 
does not begin to describe the proliferation of 
student theater that is permeating the campus, 
he adds. Currently, there are approximately 10 
student-led productions simultaneously in 
performance or rehearsal, Whittle-Utter says. 
Til be directing my third show (this semester), 
and its only my second year, he says. Thats 
an opportunity that I know I wouldnt have 
gotten anywhere else.
It is not an easy job, he adds. Producing or 
directing a show involves countless hours of 
working through all the odd tasks associated 
with putting a show together, rental of theater 
space, costume design, set, lighting, and cast
ing, he says.
Yet Whittle-Utter is not wary of pointing out 
the dramatic art departments weak spots. He 
says that even though the department has a 
couple of really fabulous teachers, the small 
community that it fosters tends to be isolation
ist.
These weaknesses aside, Whittle-Utter says 
the community and top-notch instructors 
attracted him to the department first. Still, he 
had not planned on intensely pursuing drama 
before arriving in Berkeley.
A fellow drama student, senior Scott Rabe, 
agrees, saying the department attracts some of 
UC Berkeleys top students. He adds that the
stereotype of dramatic art as an easy major 
should not be believed.
Where (pre-med students or engineering 
students) stay up all night doing labs, we stay 
up all night to do rehearsals, Rabe says. Its 
still an academic major - its not all acting.
Thats one of the good things about 
Berkeley. Its still an academic department and 
you cant get away from that. In addition to 
the UC Berkeley Center for Theater Arts dra
matic art major, a dance major is also offered, 
and there is a strong technical theater compo
nent to the curriculum, Rabe says.
With all these theater arts disciplines, he 
adds, the time commitment required remains 
as demanding as any other course of study. 
Typically, students rehearse three to four hours 
a week outside of acting or directing classes, 
which are another five to six hours a week. 
And since most students also perform in the 
student productions, four to five hours of 
rehearsal are added to their full weekdays. Yet 
all of this hard work pays off, both in the pro
ductions as well as after college.
But the question remains: What do dramatn 
ic art majors do after they graduate? The proi 
gram helps students develop. Its a social 
major, he says. You have to discuss and work 
out the problems (related to producing a 
show).
Carnegie Almanac
50 YEARS AGO
February 21, 1950 A survey conducted by the 
United World Federalists revealed that 71 percent of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology students favored a 
one-world government. These students felt that the 
nations of the world should come together under one 
government with an international legislature, police 
force, and system of courts.
The threat of war was presumably a major reason 
why students felt this way. Over half of CIT students 
felt that a third world war was likely. They said that 
if a war were to develop, they believed A and H 
bombs and other weapons of mass destruction would 
be used. They felt that a one-world government 
would help alleviate this threat.
Those students opposed to this type of government 
felt that economic and other causes of war would 
have to be eliminated before peace could prevail. 
They said that a world legislature would not accom
plish this goal.
25 YEARS AGO
February 18, 1975 Summer school tuition was 
increased from $20 to $24 per unit. Vice President of 
Enrollment Planning William Elliot said that the 
increase was because programs like Pre-College must 
be completely self-sufficient and financed by educa
tion fees paid by students.
A new program for the summer was also developed 
to help prospective students get a better idea of how 
to choose a college. Dean Allen Strehler said that too 
many students chose colleges for the wrong reasons 
and ended up in a place that was not right for them.
10 YEARS AGO
February 20, 1990The Student Affairs Office 
changed its policy regarding student emergency 
loans after a student reported unauthorized charges 
on his student account. Apparently, another student 
fraudulently obtained two student loans using a 
replacement identification card of the victim. The ID 
Center did not keep photos on record so was unaware 
that they had issued a fraudulent identification card.
After this incident, Acting Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy said that students requesting loans 
would have to fill out additional information. In 
addition, he said that a credit history check would be 
conducted so that students with poor credit histories 
would not be given loans.
FIVE YEARS AGO
February 20, 1995 At an emergency Student 
Senate meeting Student Body President Declan 
McCullagh announced his resignation, which he said
was for legal reasons. McCullagh was the center of a 
controversy relating to how he spent Student Senate 
funds. Campus Affairs Chair Brenden Mielke distrib
uted a handout showing that McCullagh circumvent
ed the Treasurer. He also distributed a receipt that 
showed that McCullagh had purchased alcohol on his 
American Express Corporate Card.
At the meeting, McCullagh thanked those with 
whom he had worked. He also highlighted his 
accomplishments, which included establishing office 
hours with President Mehrabian, reopening Scotland 
Yard, and reorganizing the disciplinary process.
ONE YEAR AGO
February 15, 1999  Student Dormitory Council 
and the Activities Board held Sex Week 99, an event 
that included lectures, workshops, and free condoms. 
According to the event organizers, Sex Week was an 
annual event at CMU until 1994.
The events included a talk by Dr. Ruth Westheimer, 
who had been named as College Lecturer of the 
Year. There was also a lecture called Creative 
Dating: Th Cure for the Common Relationship, 
where pick-up lines, inexpensive dating options, and 
general romantic tips were discussed.

Amateur hackers disable prominent web sites Secure yoUT box
by Thaddeus Billman
oSD44iLESHL
Who is mafiaboy and how can 
we find him? That is the question 
on the minds of FBI investigators 
this week, as they narrow in on the 
hacker Suspected of taking down 
CNN.com, E*Trade, and several 
smaller sites on February 8th and 
9th.
Mafiaboy, who is being 
described as a 15-year-old 
Canadian, took credit for the attacks 
and was able to give specific details 
about how they were done. 
Additionally, he is believed to have 
asked others in a chat room what 
sites to take down shortly before the 
attacks. Mafiaboy is believed to 
have been copying the coordinated 
attack on Yahoo.com, in which he 
had no apparent involvement.
Yahoo.com, the worlds largest 
and most popular Web site, was 
effectively disabled on February 
7th. At approximately 1:15 pm EST, 
Yahoo was bombarded with huge 
amounts of data in what is known as 
a denial of service attack. The huge 
amounts of fake traffic insured that 
no legitimate users were able to get 
through to the Yahoo Web pages. 
The attack was able to bypass Yahoo 
security precautions because it 
came from a large number of dis
tinct sources - about 50 separate 
computers. According to ABC News, 
Yahoo officials said that such 
attacks had been attempted and had 
failed in the past. The attack lasted 
until approximately 4:25 pm. At its 
peak, the attack was flooding Yahoo 
with more than one gigabyte per 
second of data. The attack is 
believed to have been highly coordi
nated and not the work of an indi
vidual.
On February 8th, eBay.com, 
Buy.com, CNN.com, and 
Amazon.com were taken down in 
similar attacks. It is now believed 
that eBay, which disabled the site 
for two hours, was hit by the same 
people as Yahoo. The Buy.com
fi
attack, which lasted for 
over three hours, may 
also be related. The 
other attacks were likely 
perpetrated by copycats, 
as a different set of soft
ware and slightly differ
ent techniques were used 
in those attacks.
The attacks continued 
on February 9th, as 
ZDNet.com, E*Tradc, and 
a number of smaller sites 
were hit. These attacks 
were likely also the work 
of copycats. Since then, a 
number of small sites 
have been attacked. FBI 
officials fear that these 
copycat attacks are gain
ing popularity and may 
lead to substantial prob
lems down the road.
There has been at least 
one documented case of 
a non-hacker trying to 
use the tactic. He was 
quickly caught and now 
faces jail time of up to 10 
years.
The attacks were 
accomplished by flood
ing a victim site with an 
unusually large amount 
of data, effectively keep
ing legitimate users out.
The hacker first finds a computer 
with a security hole that allows him 
to program the computer to launch 
an attack at a future date. These 
computers are known as daemons. 
When the hacker is ready to launch 
the attack, he sends instructions 
from his computer, known as the 
intruder, to another computer 
known as a master. The master then 
sends instructions to the daemon to 
start sending data. The instructions 
may go through many masters 
before reaching the daemon, mak
ing a trace nearly impossible. The 
daemon then starts sending data to 
the victim using a large variety of 
fake IP addresses, making it look as 
if the data is coming from many 
sources. This bypasses most security

THE GEEK BEAT

filters that look for unusually large 
amounts of incoming data.
Although denial of service attacks 
are effective, they are looked down 
upon by most hackers. Since the 
practice is easy and requires little or 
no knowledge, few hackers condone 
its use. Instead, they prefer to actu
ally infiltrate a system. Once inside, 
tactics vary. Many enjoy defacing 
the Web page to show their skills, 
while others seek to obtain confi
dential data. Still others do nothing 
at all, pleased just to get in and 
prove their skills. Brian Martin, edi
tor of attrition.org, was quoted by 
ABC News as saying these attacks 
are worthless and childish. There is 
no grace, no skill, and no intellect 
behind these attacks. Hacker mesMike Zimmer/Dossier Design Editor
sage boards and chat rooms also 
showed a total lack of support for 
the attacks.
Both Martin and Space Rogue, a 
member of LOpht, said that software 
exists that can stop such attacks, but 
most Web sites will not use it 
because it increases load time. They 
added that the software used to 
coordinate the attacks is not fool
proof and can be traced. However, 
its creator, Mixer, disagreed. He 
believes that as long as one is care
ful, they cant be caught using the 
software. He adds that he created 
the software specifically to demon
strate his principle.

Remember the campus security 
lecture we undergraduates all had 
to sit through during Orientation 
Week? Chief Lapaglia reminded us 
that security is everyones respon
sibility  we all have an obligation 
to participate in keeping ourselves 
and our community safe.
The same thing is true of the 
Internet. Last week, an unidenti
fied party launched denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against major 
Net hotspots such as Yahoo!, eBay, 
and Amazon.com. The nature of 
the attack serves as a reminder 
that, as citizens of the Net, we are 
all responsible for keeping our 
online community safe.
What makes this type of attack 
difficult to stop once launched is 
that, from the point of view of the 
individual machine and the net
work it resides on, the outgoing 
packets look completely legiti
mate. The, utter typhoon of packets 
or bogus IP addresses associated 
with a traditional DoS attack  
both of which are easy to detect 
and stop  arent present. The 
attack only becomes apparent 
when the many smaller streams of 
packets converge at the target site, 
and by then its too late. The victim 
is already drowning.
It follows, then, that the best  
and perhaps onlyway to prevent 
such an attack is to cut it off at its 
source. But wheres the source? 
According to reports, a number of 
the computers hijacked by the 
attackers were in university envi
ronments. These systems are often 
not protected by the firewalls 
guarding corporate networks, and 
they often are not all administered 
by a central bodyfor example, at 
Carnegie Mellon, computers in 
dorm rooms and faculty offices are 
managed by students, faculty, and 
departmental staff, not Computing 
Services. Universities also have 
access to the high-speed connec
tions needed to effectively swamp 
the target site, making them a 
prime target for establishing one or
more nodes for a distributed 
attack.
The responsibility, then, falls on 
all of us to do our part to keep the 
Internet secure, especially those of 
us running Linux or another Unix 
variant on our home systems. 
Systems running Windows or Mac 
OS are inherently more secure 
against being hijacked by a distrib
uted DoS attacker because its not 
as easy for an attacker to start a 
program remotely on these 
machines unless you install a tool 
allowing them to do so. For this 
reason, attack programs are typi
cally written to run under one of 
the various Unix-flavored operat
ing systems. It is certainly possible 
to restrict or disable protocols such 
as Telnet that allow you to start 
programs remotely on these 
machines, but its still more likely 
that an attacker will find a home 
on a Unix-based system, such as a 
PC running Linux, than on a 
Macintosh or a Windows-based PC.
Fortunately, DoS attacks have 
been a known vulnerability for 
some time now, andCMLPs very 
own Computer Emergency 
Response Team (CERT) has 
released several helpful advisories 
about how DoS attacks work and 
how system administrators can 
prevent them. Read them online at 
http://www.cert.org. There are 
also a variety of tools available, 
such as Satan, that will check a sys; 
tem for potential vulnerabilities 
and alert you to them. Run them. 
Keep an eye on your system, dis
able unnecessary or outdated 
accounts, check your log files, and 
remove services that you dont 
actually need running.
After all, security is everyones 
responsibility.

Take a chance at omniscience in Maxis latest simulation game, The Sims
GAME REVIEW
by Adam Steele
7RAE/L oSD44iLESHL
The Sims is a new game from 
Maxis, the creators of the Sim line 
of games; SimCity, SimLife, 
SimThemePark, and many others. 
The premise of the game is simple. 
Lead your Sim or family of Sims in 
their virtual life. The usual way to 
begin is as a single bachelor, with 
some starting money to buy a small 
home and your basic necessities: a 
refrigerator, a table to eat on, a toi
let and shower, maybe even a stove 
and a computer. You choose a 
career path, all of which are simi
lar in benefits but require different 
skills to succeed. The funniest thing 
about this game though is that there 
isnt anything in it that you couldnt 
just as easily experience in real life. 
When people would walk in and see 
me playing it, each of them in turn 
would comment on how stupid they 
thought it sounded. Although sure 
enough, whenever any one of them

Two oENU play pool after work in Maxis' inventive new 
simulation game, bCH oENUM 
got a chance to play the game, they 
became thoroughly addicted.
A typical day in the life of your 
Sim might go something like this.
First you wake up and make yourself 
breakfast. Then you take a shower 
and use the toilet. You know your 
car pool will be arriving soon to take 
you to work, but you decide to get in
Roboroaches save the world
On another interesting science 
note, researchers at Tokyo 
University have created a robotic 
cockroach. Japanese scientists 
implanted a big brown American 
cockroach with a microrobotic 
back pack that allows them to 
control the insects movements.
Researchers insert a tiny micro
processor and electrodes where 
the insects wings and antennae 
used to be. Then they use a 
remote control which sends sig
nals to the electrodes, making the 
roach turn left or right or go back
wards and forwards.
The head of the research team 
says the benefits of this 
Roboroach for mankind could 
be immense.
Within a few years he hopes 
electronically controlled insects 
carrying mini-cameras could be 
used for a host of sensitive mis
sions, like crawling through

victims.
And the roaches? Well, theyve 
asked for an infra-red camera, 
making it easier to find those

a short game of pool 
first. Then you go to 
work. Since you 
never actually see 
any place aside from 
your own home, the 
clock just fast-forwards for the next 
eight hours or so. 
But in that time per
haps your maid 
comes over and 
deans up your dirty 
dishes and your fish 
tank, the gardener 
stops by to water 
your plants and 
bushes, and the 
mailman delivers 
your mail (although, the only mail 
you ever get is bills). Now that 
youve gotten home from work, you 
decide to call up a few neighbors 
and have a small party. 
Unfortunately, one of them asks if 
he can bring a friend or two and it 
soon seems like you have the whole 
neighborhood coming over. After 
greeting them each in turn and 
inviting them in, you whip up a 
quick dinner for all of your guests. 
Afterwards you listen to music, per
haps play a game of chess, or watch 
TV. Unfortunately, you get another 
knock at the door. Its the police and 
they say you must quiet the party 
down. You ignore their warning 
and sure enough the police return 
and you receive a fine. Its 2 am 
before you can get into bed and your 
Sim knows he isnt going to get 
enough sleep. Tomorrow is going to 
be tough to get through.
The game was designed to be 
played such that each game session 
would be akin to an episode of a sit
com or soap-opera, and to me it 
seems to pull that off very well.
From a technical standpoint the 
game is truly amazing. It was 
designed from the start to be totally 
expandable and customizable. Dont 
like the music that plays on your 
stereo system? No problem, just 
replace the standard tracks with your 
favorite mp3s. Care to make your 
Sim look just like you? Just use a 
scanner or digital camera and one of
the many skin programs developed 
just for this game and import a Sim 
who looks like you. Dont like the 
paintings or wallpaper included with 
the game? Well then simply import 
your own. It is incredibly easy to cus
tomize the game to suit your own 
preferences. In fact I expect big con
versions to come out in time which 
will allow you to change the whole 
theme of the game. Does The Sims in 
1000 BC sound more fun, or perhaps 
you would enjoy suburbia in the year 
3000 AD? It is all possible.
Another fascinating aspect of this 
is that it has what I like to call 
multi-player with yourself. What 
this means in the context of the 
game is that you can start multiple 
families, and while you are control
ling one, your other one will contin
ue to exist and live, since the whole 
game takes place all in one neigh
borhood. So you could, while play
ing one family, call up one of your 
other players and invite him or her 
over. Your other character will act 
as best it can with the same person
ality you had been playing it with.
The game even keeps a photo 
album of the life of your Sim and 
will take photos of important events 
in the lives of your Sim. It will typi
cally consist of things like break-ins 
(yes, you can be robbed), wedding 
pictures, and pictures of your chil
dren. This photo album can even 
automatically export itself in HTML 
format so you can easily put your 
familys history up on the Web.
The game is not without faults, 
however. The only big mistake I 
think the game makers made is that 
there are no weekends. Your Sim 
has to go to work every single day. 
You can miss a day now and then, 
but definitely not two out of every 
seven. I suppose this was done to 
make the game more challenging 
but I still think it is a mistake. 
Another gripe many people have 
about the game are things like, 
why does my Sim take 25 minutes 
to take a bath? Again, I believe this 
was done to both make the game 
more challenging and to make up 
for the fact that there are many 
things you will never need to do,
like go to the supermarket. (The 
game just charges you whenever 
you make a meal, the fridge is never 
empty!) One other irritating thing 
is that the pathing could use a little 
work; sometimes it takes the Sims 
several minutes (in game, time) to 
decide who needs to move so they 
can get around each other. But all in 
all the game is quite well made. I 
have not encountered any real bugs
and the game has never crashed.
The game can appeal to a very : 
broad variety of players. I would 
recommend it to anyone who likes 
strategy games, role-playing, or 
even someone with a casual interest 
in architecture or interior design. 
Be warned though, this game is 
highly addictive and will try its best 
to suck up every minute of your 
spare time.

A day In the life of the Sims

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN - FEBRUARY 21. 2000Southern Illinois University Computer science departments struggle to handle popularity performs germ cell research
; (U-WIRE) CARBONDALE, 111. - 
Germ cell transplantation research 
at Southern Illinois University could 
eventually help correct genetic dis
eases and preserve rare or endan
gered species for future genera
tions.
Professor Lonnie Russell of the 
Physiology Department is the head 
of research at SIUC under a grant 
from the National Institute of 
Health.
Germ cell transplantation 
involves  the removal of the stem 
cells that produce sperm from the 
testes of one animal and transplant
ing those cells into a second animal. 
The second animal then begins to 
produce the sperm of the first.
I thirik its cutting edge of the 
field, said Professor Andrzej 
Bartke, chairman of the Physiology 
Department, about the researchs 
potential. The possible practical 
applications for this technology are 
three-fold, Russell said.
First, there is a potential to correct 
genetic diseases. Germ cells from an 
individual with a genetic disorder 
could be removed, altered genetical
ly to remove the inherited disease, 
and returned to the same individ
ual. All the other genetic character
istics of the individual would 
remain, minus the genetic disease.
That means your children would 
not have a particular disease, a fatal 
disease like cystic fibrosis, Russell 
said.
The second application is the 
study of the production of sperm. 
For example, rat sperm takes 53 
days to develop, while mouse sperm 
takes 35. Stem cells, transplanted 
from a rat to mouse still take 53 days 
to develop sperm, showing that the 
stem cells determine the rate of 
development, independent of the 
host animal. The third reason is the 
potential to preserve rare and 
endangered species by collecting 
stem cells. Stem cells could be 
frozen and later used to reproduce
as many germ cells as needed.
As the stem cells divide and 
rearrange themselves, you get dif
ferent gene combinations, Russell 
said. Thats one reason children of 
a family are so different.
That is also one reason stem cell 
transplants may have an advantage 
over cloning in the preservation of 
endangered species, Russell said.
While research in the past has 
included the transplantation of 
germ cells between different 
species, such as from a rat to a 
mouse, current SIUC research is try
ing to determine how far apart 
genetically two mice can be before 
transplantation can be successful.
Just as an organ transplant 
between humans requires a genetic 
match to prevent the immune sys
tem from causing rejection of the 
transplanted organ, transplanted 
stem cells also require a close 
match, Russell explained.
Fernando Alves, a visiting 
researcher from Sao Paulo, Brazil, is 
working with livestock to determine 
the feasibility of a similar procedure 
on farm animals. So far, Alves has 
been injecting the testes of hogs 
with dye to follow the injection 
through the structure of the testes. 
Alves said that the actual transplan
tation of germ cells would take place 
in early April.
The tests in April would involve 
transplanting the germ cells from 
one breed of hog into a boar of a dif
ferent breed. After a few months, 
the recipient boar would be allowed 
to breed to determine if the trans
plant was successful.
If he has a different color or a dif
ferent distribution of colors in his off
spring, then well know he produced 
sperm from the donor, Alves said.
The $900,000 NIH grant is shared 
with Washington State University, 
where professor Mike Griswold is 
heading up collaborative research 
using mice. The WSU portion of the 
research is studying the effects of 
mutated cells.
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. - 
The boom in the Internet economy 
has proved to be a' double-edged 
sword for university Computer 
Science departments nationwide.
While a massive rush to major in 
the lucrative field has spurred 
demand for faculty in the depart
ments, the Internets lure is siphon
ing off those candidates who were 
previously more likely to enter 
academia.
At Princeton, where the number 
of majors doubled from 42 in 1994 
to 85 in 1999, the Computer 
Science department has been 
bursting at the seams, said the 
department's acting chair Ken 
Steiglitz in an email.
Part of the pressure on the 
department comes from an expand
ing interest by non-majors to learn 
computer basics they will need for 
the future, according to Dean of 
Engineering and Applied Science 
James Wei.
We felt that all engineering stu
dents should take a computer sci
ence class, but increasingly all the 
liberal arts students feel they cannot enter todays working world 
unless they know something about 
computers, Wei said. He added 
that the trustees have discussed a 
goal of 100 percent undergraduate 
participation in computer science 
courses.
Achieving this goal would 
require the department to expand, 
finding new faculty and resources, 
while retaining its current staff.
There is of course fierce compe
tition for the best people today, and 
resource allocation at the universi
ty is always difficult, Steiglitz said.
The university is not the only 
school facing enrollment increases. 
The number of computer science 
majors at schools such as the 
University of Michigan, Stanford, 
Yale, Cornell and Rice Universities 
have all doubled during the past 
few years, according to officials at 
those institutions. Stanfords 
Computer Science Department, 
which graduates approximately 
380 undergraduates a year and 
enrolls almost 85 percent of all 
undergraduates in its two introduc
tory courses, has found itself rely
ing more on outside lecturers and
its PhD candidates to cover teach
ing sections, according to depart
ment manager Peache Turner.
We have a lot of former students 
in the industry who are willing to 
help us out, Turner said, citing as a 
chief reason the schools proximity 
to Silicon Valley - the symbolic core 
of the countrys computer business.
Moshe Vardi, the chair of the 
Rice Computer Science depart
ment, said his university has expe
rienced an explosion in computer 
science course enrollment - caus
ing the faculty to strain to keep 
pace.
We are trying to increase our 
faculty, but that does not happen 
overnight. The job market is such 
that the industry is attracting peo
ple who usually enter academics. 
This is the case in small, large and 
tiny schools across the country - all 
over the place, he added.
Larger research universities 
such as Cornell are battling the 
same problems with large classes 
and competition for experienced 
faculty.
The department used to be dri
ven by people purely interested in
the science, and there are still 30 to 
40 of those a year, chair of 
Cornells Computer Science 
Department Charles Venloan 
explained. But the 'growth has 
been in the commercial end, with 
more and more ending up on Wall 
Street, to use a metaphor.
Within the Cornell department, 
which has doubled in the past five 
years at a rate of 10 to 15 percent a 
year, Venloan noted that under
graduates have been planning at 
least a dozen startups.
PhD candidates now face the, 
question, Do I go into academia or 
industry? Venloan said. And the 
salary differential generally points 
to industry.

Critic finds The Boiler Room to be merely lukewarm
MOVIE REVIEW
by Thaddeus Billman
oSD44iLESHL
How far would you go to make a 
million dollars? Would you push 
yourself really hard? Would you do 
something illegal? Would you sacri
fice your morals? Those are the 
questions Seth Davis (Giovanni 
Ribisi) must ask himself in the new 
movie, The Boiler Room.
Seeking his fathers approval and 
influenced by the wealth he sees 
everywhere, he sets out to make his 
fortune. After dropping out of col
lege, he runs an illegal casino. Hes 
making good money, but he isnt 
exactly getting rich. His father soon 
learns about the casino and, as a 
prominent judge, orders Seth to 
shut it down. Shortly thereafter, 
Seth is introduced to the J. T. 
Marlin brokerage firm and decides 
to interview for a job.
What Seth finds is nothing like he 
expected. To start, J. T. Marlin con
ducts group interviews. The inter
view begins with head recruiter Jim 
Young (Ben Affleck) asking if any
one has a series seven license. He 
proceeds to kick out anyone who 
does. J. T. Marlin is not interested in 
hiring brokers; it is interested in 
training them. Jim then proceeds to 
promise that anyone who works 
there will earn $1 million within

three years. How is this possible? J. 
T. pays higher rips (commissions) 
than any firm on Wall Street.
Seth decides to take the job and is 
soon moving up the brokerage hier
archy. He passes the series seven 
tests in record time and accumu
lates the 40 accounts required to 
become a full broker in less than a 
month. He is now ready to start 
opening accounts for himself. All 
appears to be going his way, but 
things turn quickly. He begins to 
learn the brokerages dark secrets 
and is soon under attack from all 
sides.
First time writer/director Ben 
Younger has created a realistic, 
well-researched piece. However, his 
inexperience shows. In general, his 
writing is strong, but at times it falls 
to the level of clich. He has some 
interesting ideas and writes effec
tive dialogue, but the story lacks 
any real depth. Attempts at emo
tional conflict fail miserably, com
ing off as fake and superficial. 
Consequently, such scenes are 
downplayed considerably. Thus, 
one can never quite relate to the 
characters.
The main problem, however, is
the directing. The plot line offers a 
substantial opportunity for a fastpaced thriller. Unfortunately, 
scenes run too long to achieve this 
effect. Other scenes serve no partic
ular purpose or are just plain bor
ing. Things dont flow well from 
one scene to the next. It isnt all 
bad, however, as Youngers style is 
unique and enjoyable. His deficien
cies are likely related to inexperi
ence and, hopefully, can be over
come with time.
The acting in The Boiler Room is 
fairly good. Giovanni Ribisi is profi
cient as Seth and Nia Long does a 
fine job playing the firms secretary. 
However, as a couple they fail, with 
no real chemistry between them. 
Vin Diesel as Chris, a senior broker 
at J. T. Marlin, is excellent. His per
formance really stands out. Other 
good performances come from Ben 
Affleck and Scott Caan as Richie, 
another broker at the firm.
Overall, The Boiler Room is a fair
ly average film. It has parts that are 
good and parts that are not. Like 
many films, it had the potential to 
be a great motion picture, but set
tled for mediocrity instead. I would 
recommend it to people interested 
in an unusual tale about the inner 
workings of a corrupt brokerage 
firm, but would not recommend it 
to someone who expects a fastpaced dramatic thriller.

that youve been invit
ed to dinner at some culinarily 
enabled friends house and the real
ization that you can talk as loudly as 
you want without bothering too 
many strangers. The dining rooms 
look elegant but not intimidating, 
with walls the color of guacamole 
and a well-chosen set of decorations.
DINING OUT
Traditional-looking tapestries and 
religious folk art mix with dangling 
red pepper mobiles. The creativity 
extends to the tableware. For exam
ple, the fajitas  even the non-beef 
ones  come on cow-shaped metal
and-wood serving plates.
Unfortunately, we had to wait a 
long time before we ever got those 
fajitas. Service, while friendly, tends 
to be on the slow side. While some 
delays are certainly understandable,
food was brought to our table. By the the fajitas, on the grounds that there 
time our waiter came back with the must be a reason for the restaurants 
salsa, the chips were already long name. Theyre always delicious, no
gone. We got to stare longingly at the 
salsa for 10 or 15 minutes before we 
finally got another batch of chips.
On the other hand, the chips and 
dip tasted great, as did everything 
that came after them. Both the menu 
selection and the cooking are a step 
up from the usual Mexican restau
rant. You can get flavorful versions of

especially considering how tables are 
scattered all over the place, long ones 
can get annoying. For instance, we 
ordered chips with boat dip  gua
camole, cheese, refried beans, and 
other yummy stuff all layered togeth
er  as an appetizer, then realized 
we wanted salsa as well when the
old standbys like enchiladas and bur
ritos as well as the kinds of dishes 
that will never find their way to Taco 
Bell  chicken with pumpkin seed 
sauce or fish a la veracruzana, with 
tomato sauce, olives, capers, and 
chiles.
When Im there, I generally order
matter if you get chicken, steak, or 
shrimp. Perfectly-grilled meat com
bines with moist tortillas and all the 
guacamole, cheese, etc., you could 
ever want. Even the grilled onions 
served along with the meat, not usu
ally the most exciting part of fajitas, 
have lots of flavor. The only problem 
is the price  $9.95 for vegetarian
____________ fajitas, $13.95 for
chicken, and more 
______'  for everything else.
In fact, most things 
here seem a little too 
expensive. The only 
entrees under $10 
are things like the 
burritos or
chimichangas, and 
most of the rest 
approach $15 or even 
$20. But somehow, 
when youre scoop
ing up the last of the 
guacamole or ensur
ing that theres no bit 
of meat you some
how overlooked, you 
dont really mind the 
price. At least, not
too much.
To get to Fajita Grill from campus, 
make a right onto Fifth Avenue 
towards Shadyside, another left onto 
Negley Avenue, and a right onto 
Ellsworth. The restaurant will be a few 
blocks down on your left.
New Music
Two-Disc compilation blends multiple genres
Album Title: bCH mHUS mHUS /4 sHnD fRSE
Artist: Fela Kuti
Label: Universal Records
out of four stars
by Aseem Gupta
0HWNDUSHL
Fela Kutis newest compilation of his pieces, 
The Best Best of Fela Kuti, has been met with 
critical acclaim both in the United States and 
in Europe, where Kuti was educated in music. 
Kutis pieces are a dynamic blend of African, 
European and American music styles. While 
most artists who attempt to mix the unique 
styles of three different continents fail miser
ably, Kuti is gloriously successful.
Threads of all three regions are clearly audi
ble in Kutis eclectic music. Perhaps the most 
notable influence in his music is American 
jazz, which is clearly heard in his magnificent 
vocal overlays as well in his improvisational 
style of songwriting. Kuti called his style of 
music Afro-Beat while he was in Los Angeles, 
and his unique style continued to influence 
others even after his death in 1997. Kutis 
inspirational music lives on throughout the 
world and is unique because of its noteworthy 
meaning.
The Best Best of Fela Kuti is comprised of two 
CDs whose span of music covers 17 years. The 
influence of time on Kutis music is clear. In 
the first few tracks, including Lady, 
Shakara, and Gentleman, Kutis music 
makes heavy use of the guitar, providing for 
sound that is more rock and roll than Kutis 
later works which are more subdued musical
ly. Some of the later tracks on the CD are qui
eter in terms of music  Kuti laid off of the 
guitar  but the tracks are more powerful in 
their political messages. Kuti, a Nigerian 
native, spent several months in Nigerian 
prison on trumped-up charges, and he has 
always been vocal about political issues in 
Nigeria, Europe, and the United States. Dont 
get the impression that Kutis music is dark, 
serious, and laced with deep political mes
sages that take away from his tracks musicality. Kutis music can be appreciated by any
body. Even without taking Kutis meaning of 
the music into account, the tracks are 
extremely rich, based on musical content 
alone.
Cheap Movies(for cheap students)
movies you may have seen before
BY ANDY FRANCIS
The General
Thursday, February 24
As part of this month of classic or old Thursday movies 
comes this 1927 Civil War-era comedy written and directed by 
film legend Buster Keaton. Buster. Theres a name I could def
initely live with. No one gets cool old-guy-sounding nicknames 
anymore, like Red, Lefty, or Shaq," which is a sad thing.
Regardless, this movie is apparently some sort of classic in 
the silent film comedy genre. Having never seen a silent film 
before (although I made this amazing flipbook in second 
grade), it seems to me quite a challenge to be really funny 
without sound. Im trying right now, and I dont see you laugh
ing one bit. Maybe I should try some slapstick or some gratu
itous nudity.
I dont want to slight The General, though - its influence on 
film comedy is still felt today, particularly the scene where 
General Robert E. Lee has sex with an apple pie and General 
Stonewall Jackson walks in on him and suggests they tell 
Jefferson Davis they ate the whole thing. Classic stuff.
At 8, 10 pm, and midnight

Star Wars Episode I: 
The Phantom Menace
Friday, February 25
As Im sure every CMU student knows already, Star Wars was 
canceled two weeks ago. Nevertheless, SDC is bringing it back 
this week. So without further ado, heres Nick Winters (Bill 
Murray) once again in an encore performance:
And hey, how bout that nutty Star Wars bar?
Did you see all those creatures in there?
And hey, Darth Vader with that black and evil mask
Did he scare you as much as he scared me?
At 7:30, 10 pm, and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
The World is Not Enough
Saturday, February 26
Everybodys favorite action hero/pimp, James Bond, is back 
to battle the bad guys once again. This is the 53rd installment 
of the popular Bond franchise. (Sure, I made 53 up  to be 
perfecdy honest, its not worth my time to find out how many 
Bond movies have been made  youd just forget anyway.)
Although the series has enjoyed a resurgence with Pierce 
Brosnan as superspy 007, the quality of villain has dropped off 
a tad. Worlds enemy, for example, is a man impervious to pain 
as a result of a bullet lodged in his head. I remember the good 
old days, back when Bond would take people on just because 
they were clearly communists and damnit, thats what com
munists deserved.
Maybe the U.S. (or the U.K., perhaps) needs a new arch
nemesis (Canada? Iceland? I dont want hate mail from 
denizens of either country -1 assure you they were chosen at 
random) to make the whole good versus evil thing a litde 
clearer for us moviegoers. I, for one, am tired of movies mak
ing me think and form my own conclusions. If I want that, Ill 
read a book (empty threat) or a magazine (probably Mad).
At 10 pm and 12:30 am
In McConomy Auditorium
The Rocky Horror Picture Show/ 
Shock Treatment
Sunday, February 27
The mother of all cult movies, The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show has been described by some fanatics as the greatest 
movie of all time. Other less-substance-abusing filmgoers 
have described it as simply a movie. Either way, the tale of 
Dr. Frank-N-Furter and his friends from the planet 
Transsexual shows no sign of letting up after 25 years of mid
night showings.
A big part of this movie is audience participation during the 
floor show; various parts of the film require rice tossing, can
dle lighting, and responding to parts of the dialogue. (Well, 
actually, if you do either of the first two of those actions in 
McConomy, the movie will end and everyone will be kicked 
out immediately. And dont even think about throwing rotten 
eggs at Meat Loaf. However, youre still more than welcome 
to come dressed as a transvestite.)
So, make sure to clear some space in your busy Sunday 
night schedule for the first ever showing of The Rocky Horror 
Picture Show and its sequel Shock Treatment at CMU. Most 
of these italics are unnecessary, but as usual, I dont care.
Rocky Horror Picture Show at 6:30 and 10 pm (floor show)
Shock Treatment at 7:45 and 11:45 pm

One of the nicest things about Europe is 
the dining experience. People eat for hours, 
socializing, toasting, drinking, spending 
money, which I have plenty of because my 
comic is nationally syndicated. My favorite 
restaurant is by far Baldies, quirky yet classy.
.L-D-Up 0u9hM.!* 
-sssss^ 70.00 chf
Baldies is ahead of its time, it represents 
the future of dining. At Baldies each 
customer is not only given the opportunity, 
but is required to eat their meal off the 
beautiful balding head of a middle-aged 
man. Believe me, it is worth every franc.
I never realized how exciting an ordinary 
meal could become until it was served 
to me, at scalding temperatures, on the 
bald head of a tranquilized employee.
A 3-d meal, every fork-full taken from a 
new region of this pliable, fleshy landscape.
I went to the owner himself and asked how 
he could afford such an undertaking. He 
said it was not easy to change the world, 
but he had to start somewhere. He also 
whispered that the cost of plates is actually 
more than his smooth-headed slaves' wages.

Hello, everyone. This is Dr. Vox. P. Remember me? Come on. It 
has not been that long since I wrote words into sentences which 
made absolutely no sense. Well, I am glad to be writing again to 
whoever reads. 2000 is here but are we here as well, or are we 
parting as its 1999? I hope we get some of our fence back and 
finished with the pipes, so we can walk to Doherty from UC with 
absolutely no worry. Well, it's almost mid-semester. But not yet. 
I will talk to you more about that next time. Peace out.
