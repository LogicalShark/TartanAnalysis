Student Congress Plays 
Active Campus Role
by Liz Greeley and Yum-Yum
r
Elections for next years 
delegates will be held on May
The Student Congress this year' 
has been one of the most active 
organizations on campus.
During the course of the year, 
Congress members have proposed 
such amendments as the place
ment of pencil sharpeners in 
strategic places in school build
ings.
They have also spent long hours 
trying to pass a motion that will 
provide students with aluminum 
ping pong tables in Skibo.
After several weeks of discus
sion and questions, it was agreed 
The tables have not yet been put 
that some sort of action be taken, 
in at Skibo. Possibly, something 
will be done about them by 
June, the Sharp Committee head 
has been quoted as stating.
,Congress president, Soe Anan1 dillac asked members to please 
report congress proceedings back 
to the groups they represent. 
Apparently, said the presi
dent, no one knows what has 
been going on about campus.
He also requested that the Tar
tan give more of a spread to Con
gress proceedings.

ITecli To Build 
Seven Houses 
For Sororities
oStudents Rally 
To Defend 
Civil Rights
As a result of the current 
civil rights struggle in the 
south, hundreds of Carnegie 
Tech students demonstrated 
^on the Cut last Friday.
The demonstration began spon
taneously at 8 p.m. and ended at 
dawn.
Students, many with signs, 
marched around Baker Hall, sing
ing We Shall Overcome.
A collection was taken in order 
to finance the chartering of two 
buses to travel to Selma, Alabama. 
96 students of both sexes boarded 
the buses Sunday night armed 
 with a petition signed by 1,122 
students and professors demand
ing an end to racial discrimina
tion.
Upon arrival in Selma, they 
plan to march up and down the 
towns main street singing. They 
then plan to march to the state 
capitol, Montgomery, where they 
hope to present Governor Wallace 
with the petition.
The Carnegie Tech administra^ tion has declared a 3-day holiday 
beginning Monday. Dr. Gordon 
Hoford Stover personally tele
phoned Dr. Martin Calvin Lutherstein, Jr. to ensure him that he 
has full Carnegie Tech support in 
his struggle against racial in
justice in Alabama.
SC Meeting
Student Congress will 
meet today at the 
Greeks from 4:30 p.m. 
to 4:30 a.m. The major 
topic of discussion will 
be concerned with the en
forcement of the Penn
sylvania State Liquor 
control laws on campus.
The seven Carnegie Tech 
sororities are making plans to 
build sorority houses.
The Administration Planning 
Committee has been working with 
the sororities, with the goal of 
having final building plans com
pleted by March, 1970.
The planning committee feels 
that with the addition or sorority 
houses more rooming space will 
be made available in Morewood 
Gardens. The houses will also 
permit a larger female enrollment 
in the University.
Approximately $125.000 will be 
appropriated to the seven sorori
ties for building houses.
The sisters have already put 
in their bids for land and archi
tectural designs.
Dr. Bathhouse, chairman of the 
Housing Committee, said that the 
project has turned into a three 
little pigs affair. One group has 
planned on a glass house, an
other on a log cabin style, and 
a third on a colonial brick de
sign.
The Carnegie Tech administra
tion, however, may play big 
bad wolf, according to Mrs. Gillfavor, resident head at Morewood 
Gardens. She feels that the ad
ministration may ccnsor some 
of the elaborate schemes dreamed 
up by the girls.
The sorority houses might turn 
out to be glorified lean-tos, said 
Zelda Zilch, president of KKK 
Sorority.
More planning w il 1 go into 
these plans before ground is 
broken on the football field. The 
football team has objected to 
losing their play area, but pro
visions will be made for a new 
stadium.
Any suggestions for house plans 
s h o u 1 dbe submitted to Linda 
Lion, president of the Pan Hell 
organization.

Tweed Chosen 
Best-Dressed 
On Campus
The Best-Dressed Man on 
the Carnegie Tech campus 
was announced by the Tartan
today.
Clyde Tweed, sub-senior finger 
painting, from Hoboken, New Jer
sey, was named winner of this 
all-campus competition.
Tweed, more commonly referred 
to as Tweedy, is a member of 
Sigma Pigma Sty fraternity. He 
is a counter-goralla for ROTC and 
during his spare time he delivers 
pizza for Shadytown Synthetics.
Many eligible young males 
floating about campus participated 
in the contest.
General standards for the com
petition were: high sneakers,
white socks, green work pants, 
flannel shirts, bow ties, crew cuts, 
glasses, and slide rules. Occasion
ally a beard or mustache would 
appear on the campus face, but 
little attention was paid to such 
growths.
When asked where he purchased 
his cool wardrobe, Tweed reBest-Dressed Candidate And 
Friend
plied, From the army-navy sur
plus store in Hoboken.
For the final judging Tweed 
wore black high sneakers, argyle 
socks, skin-tight tan levis, a Sig
ma Pigma Sty sweatshirt with 
cut-off sleeves and finger paint 
smears, his double H (Hoboken 
Heifers) baseball cap, and a plaid 
ponchow. He carried a Smoker 
he Bear flashlight, and bifocals, 
and a single gold earring.
Carnegie Tech Cited 
As Collegiate Model
The editors of I.V. League Magazine, Allen Ginsbig and 
Jack Carroway, have chosen Carnegie Tech as The Most 
Collegiate Campus of the Year.
They made their selection on*

the basis of school spirit in cam
pus activities and appropriateness 
of student dress for ivy league 
campus life. The content of school 
publications was also given con
sideration.
According to the magazine, the 
percentage of Carnegie Tech stu
dents involved in extracurricular 
activities is higher than in any 
other comparable institution.
Student participation was par
ticularly noted in Student Con
gress, publications, and religious 
activities.
We have observed that Stu
dent Congress has 100% attend
ance each week. As far as publi
cations are concerned, each has 
received first place prizes in the 
Columbian Press Competition. It 
is inspiring to see the participa
tion in religious activities, in par
ticular, the Wednesday Free 
Church Suppers, said Ginsbig.
Ginsbig and Garroway also cited 
student participation in the burn
ing of Windgrass Pharmacy as an 
example of undergraduate enthu
siasm in community events.
Carnegie Techs best-dressed 
man, Clyde Tweed, was mentioned 
by the editors of I.V. League as a
The winner of WRCTs Name 
the Birds contest is Gary Lindstrom, a senior and past president 
of Phi Kappa Theta. The win
ning names were Arcy for Bird 
one and Tee for Bird two. The 
names were selected by a panel 
of judges set up by WRCT Radio.
The management of WRCT 
wishes to thank all persons who 
entered the contest for their in
terest. If you would like to serve 
on the WRCT staff, stop in to the

flop-notch representative of cool. 
According to Ginsbig and Gar
roway, The Grit Skit, Carnegie 
Techs humour magazine, influ
enced us greatly in our choice. 
Not only is the humour timely, it 
is also clever without being crass 
or gross.
Obiks will be situated in 
Schenley Park, covering an area 
of 200 feet by 150 feet. In addi
tion to the buildings of the stu
dent union, Obiks will include an 
out-door swimming pool, which 
will be used as an ice-skating 
rink during the winter.
Besides having a cafeteria, stu
dent activities offices, two main 
ballrooms and lecture halls, Obiks 
will contain many new features.
The snack bar will consist of 
asorted sized tables and chairs, 
a horse-shoe shaped bar, and a 
free juke box. Food and drink 
machine will be set off by a par
tition. The walls will be done in 
walnut, creating an atmosphere 
conducive to student relaxation.
There will be two co-ed loung
es, One will contain sofas, loung
ing chairs, and a juke box. The 
larger will have tables and chairs 
for two, a juke box, and a soda 
machine. This will be mainly for 
dancing.
Obiks will also contain a pingpong room, a pool room, a tele
vision room, and a record room.
Obiks will be open from 9 a.m 
to 12:30 a.m. weekdays and Sun
day, and from 10:00 a,m, to 1:15 
a.m. on Friday and Saturday. On 
big weekends Obiks will remain 
open until 2:30.
Library Lists 
Revised Hours
As a result of inadequate use. 
Hunt Library has revised its 
hours to the following schedule: 
weekdays, 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.; Fri
day and Saturday, 9 p.m. to 1 
a.m.; and Sunday, 8 a.m. to 11 
a.m.
The library staff felt that these 
hours would meet the needs of 
the majority of the students,
In order to reduce the high 
rate of book less from the li
brary, Rent-a-Cops will be on 
duty at all times to check the 
books, brief cases, and purses of 
everyone who walks past the li
brary.

Tartan Opens 
Pan Heel Plot 
Against WCTU
In a daring raid upon a 
secret meeting of Pan Heel, 
this reporter, while posing as 
a statue, was able to gain 
shocking information which 
heretofore has never been 
made public.
At this meeting the social chair
man of SAP, Sigma Alpha Pie, 
threatened to boycott Pan Heel 
if it continued the drive to bring 
WCTU under its jurisdiction. The 
social chairman of SAP, who 
wishes her name withheld for 
security reasons, feels that 
WCTUs influence is not to be de
sired at Friday night parties.
However, the WCTU move is 
directly in line with Pan Heels 
planning board. This group feels 
that tea is a much more sophisti
cated beverage than others in 
vogue, and that women of Pan 
Heel are losing their poise by at
tending functions where certain 
drinks are served. It was even 
rumored that Pan Heel may boy
cott Carnegie Techs Greek men 
if they persist in present party 
habits.
A move wos also made to limit 
rushing to four semesters in order 
that women being rushed might 
graduate in five years.

Say girls in More wood, when 
you call WRCT for requests and 
dedications on Sunday nights, you 
dont want to have to spend your 
dimes do you? Well, now you 
dont have to! You can now call 
('/WRCT completely free of charge. 
Just stroll on over to the phone 
(thats the one without the slot 
for the money), pick it up, and 
dial 11. You will now be con
nected with a direct line to the 
WRCT studios.
Installed last Saturday, the 
WRCT staff reports the line is 
working better than expected. 
Even though this phone service is 
not free and the cost is being 
f borne by WRCT, the staff thinks 
that this will provide a valuable 
service for the girls in Morewood.
As a result of the addition of 
this extension to the phone lines, 
the WRCT staff can also call the 
girls on the house phone after 
curfew.
New Courses
(continued from page 2)
mund Freud, has not yet ap
pointed instructors for these 
courses.
The economics department has 
added a course entitled Local 
Monopolies I and II. This course 
will include study of such local 
monopolies as Skibo, Woodlawn 
and the Bookstore. Their poli
cies and prices will be carefully 
^alyzed, and an attempt will be 
made to arrive at a solution for 
the problems created by these 
establishments.
.Courses as yet unclassified as 
to \ department include Astron
omy, MS V. Towel Hoarding, and 
ivanced Physical Education. 
The astronomy course will be an 
elective carrying no academic 
credit. It will meet nightly from 
9 p.m. until your eyes get tired, 
and classes are to be held in the 
PKA house, third floor front.
MS V, or Advanced Mud Sling
ing, is highly recommended for 
home economics students, jobless 
humor magazine staff writers, 
and bi-partisan rat finks. This 
course is not to be confused with 
one with similar course letters 
which is taught by the U.S. 
Army: fifth and sixth year
ROTC. This latter course is not 
an elective.

This reception wil be along the.

The traditional receptions were 
held before a dress-up dance. 
Students were received by the

duced to sophomore escorts. These 
escorts led the students into the

According to past sophomore 
escorts, the affair was quite im
pressive.
Said one boy, I got to meet the 
freshman girls that night. An
other remembered counting the 
lines to see who Id be stuck 
with.
But the presidents found the 
proceedings rather painful.
It has been said that several

and swollen fists after the affair.
The administration will give no 
reason for their cancelling of the

Youll obtain valuable junior management experience ... a fuller and richer 
campus life . . . extra spending money ($40 per month during your junior 
and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) . . . and, 
when you graduate, an Army Officers commission as Second Lieutenant.
Then youll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often 
abroad with opportunities for travel.

opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.
Or send in the coupon below for complete information. Theres no obligation 
involved, and youll not be subjected to any "hard sell recruiting effort. ,

Athletic System Revamped;
Forbes Field In New Plan
by Robert Clemente
Prompted by Student Congress requests for an improved 
athletic system at CIT, the Carnegie Tech administration 
has reorganized the schools athletic program.
It arranged a high-level sum
mit meeting to analyze the prob
lems of Carnegie Tech athletic 
teams and to put forth some defi
nite statement on the future of 
sports at the school.
Last Saturday, Mel Stevecrats, 
Director of Athletics, announced 
that a sports renaissance will 
occur at Carnegie Tech in the 
next few years. A number of 
well-known sporis figures have 
been recruited to direct the vared manager of the Carnegie Tech 
towel department.
All football games in 1965 will 
be played at Forbes Field, said 
Mr. Stevecrats. CIT is currently 
negotiating the purchase of the 
Pirates home. We also hope to 
purchase the Civic Arena dome 
for installation at Forbes Field. 
The present Tech Field will be 
flooded and used for yachting and 
fishing during the summer and 
ice-skating in the winter months.sity teams next year, according to 
Stevercrats. Present members of
the athletic staff have been reasTowel Reassigned
signed to posts commensurate; Basketball will also be an im 
with their past performance. i portant part of the new sports
Micholosen Hired
The 1965 football team will be 
coached by John Hung in Effigy 
Micholosen. Micholosen was for
merly employed by the University 
of Pittsburgh. Howard Buddy 
Parker and James J. Dillon will 
head Micholosens staff. Parker 
was formerly associated with the 
Pittsburgh Stealers. Dillon comes 
to Tech after a term as head of 
rackets (the tennis type) for the 
city of Pittsburgh. Ex-headcoach 
Joe Gasparella has been appointpicture at Carnegie Tech. Frank 
Towel will direct the Tartan basketballers next year. Towel is a 
veteran member of the Carnegie 
Tech athletic staff. In an exclu
sive interview with Towel last 
week in the mens shower at 
Skibo Gym, the Tartan learned of 
plans to expand the present gym 
to accommodate approximately 
12,000 spectators.
Carnegie Tech will sponsor var
sity teams in track, golf, swim
ming, and egg-tossing next year.
Arnie Palmer has already been 
signed as golf coach. All golf 
matches will be played at the new 
Pebble Beach Country Club in 
Pittsburghs Hill District.
Leonard Woods, presently the 
chef at Woodlawn Pharmacy, will 
instruct the Tartan egg-tossers.
Stevercrats concluded his news 
conference in the State Depart
ment Auditorium with the dis
closure that Carnegie Tech will be 
a charter member in the Big 
Thirteen, a new intercollegiate 
athletic association which will in
clude Notre Dame, Michigan State 
University and Midland High 
School.
Tech Profs Form 
Skateboard Team
It was observed on Monday 
afternoon that the members of the 
English department have assem
bled an intra-faculty skateboard 
team.
They have not officially de
clared their intentions but an 
alert Tartan reporter spied Dr. 
Talkasoph careening down Hill 2 
of the buggy course in Schenley 
Park. He was closely followed by 
Dr. Silencio, on one leg, and Mr. 
Footrest, who was assuming the 
position nf a handstand.
Freshmen Introduce 
Tiddlywinks To CIT
by Alfred Newman
If Carnegie Tech cannot win at conventional intercolleg
iate sports such as basketball and football, perhaps we can dc*. 
better at the English game of tiddlywinks. ___________J*
In keeping with Carnegie Techs 
well-known policy of recruiting 
outstanding high school athletes, 
several outstanding athletes, sev
eral outstanding tiddlers were 
convinced to enroll at Tech last 
semester. These gung-ho freshmen 
have exhibited their talents at 
Freshman camp, Morewood Gar
dens, and Skibo. They also engage 
in regular week-end games in the 
Hammerschlag House lobby.
Using such exotic terms as 
squidger, squop, desquop, and 
rnowski, these dedicated athletes 
are now in training for future in
tercollegiate competition. This is 
not as far-fetched as it sounds  
Harvard and M.I.T. in the U
and Cambridge and Oxford in 
England, have competing teams.
Having recently associated with 
the English Tiddlywinks Associa
tion (ETWA), Techs team is hard 
at work arranging a challenging 
schedule for next season.
Last semester the CIT Tiddly^'j 
winks Team posted a challenge 
on the bulletin board in the Pitt 
Student Union. No one has ac
cepted  therefore, Carnegie 
Tech has finally beaten Pitt in an 
intercollegiate sport, even though 
could accomplish it only by
