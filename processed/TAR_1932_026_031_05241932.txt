Unmanageable Doors On Campus Bring
Envy, Wrath, Chivalry In Students
By MARY McCULLOUGH
Having always been very meek, 
peaceful and entirely harmless, we 
never venture our supposed opin
ions on the depression, the weather, 
Manchuria, or kidnappings. Never
theless, when things come to such 
a state that' our response in an 
association test in psychology is 
so far from normal that even the 
instructor is astonished, we feel 
that we have a right to soliloquize 
on doorsdoprs . being the word 
that invoked the response.
The doors on our campus, which 
must have been responsiblefor the 
abnormality, are notable, or as we 
sometimes maliciously think, noto
rious. First of all is the door to
Administration Hall. It holds a 
unique place as the most resistent 
compound.of glass and metal ever 
set up. Every time that we have 
to enter by thatdoor, we begin to 
brace ourselves for the ordeal yards 
away. Feeling just like a Volga 
boatman or part of . a tug of war 
crew, we charge upon it with all 
our strength. There is, however, 
one redeeming feature about that 
doorit brings out all the latent 
chivalry in the men of the school. 
Such a phenomena , is decidedly 
satisfying to our sense of roman
ticism and to our little white arms. 
We remember, with chagrin one 
lad who didnt go chivalrous. Just 
as we were about to lunge up

CARNEGIE STAFF 
AIDS CAMPAIGN
Each Employee Requested to 
Contribute One Days 
Wage
The Carnegie committee of the 
Family-Hclp-Family Campaign, ap
pointed by the College Administra
tion, has unanimouslj' agreed that 
each employee of the college be 
requested to contribute an amount 
equal to a days wages. This ac
tion is 1 due to the committees 
realization that human lives depend 
on the success of the campaign.
So far the Family-Hclp-Family 
Workers, in an extensive three 
weeks campaign in the business 
districts of Pittsburgh, has raised 
only $500,000, enough to care for 
5,000 families for three months. 
The funds of the Emergency As
sociation, raised in the joint cam
paign with the Welfare Fund last 
fall, and used to care for not only 
these 5,000 but 23,000 additional 
families, are now exhausted. The 
only relief for these families is 
that to be provided by the FamilyHelp-Family Campaign which 
should be aided by every working 
man and woman.

SENIORS INVITED 
TO ALUMNI DANCE
Annual Dance to be Held 
in Thistle Hall 
Saturday
The Alumni Dance, which is being 
given by the Engineering Alumni 
Association of the Carnegie Alumni 
Federation, will be held in Thistle 
Hall Saturda}r evening from 9 to 
12. Will Ryshanck and his band who 
will be playing on the campus for 
the last time this year will furnish 
the music. Invitations have been sent 
to all members of the graduating 
class, and they ma}r secure their 
tickets at the Alumni Office any time 
this week free of charge. This dance, 
to which the seniors arc invited to 
bring a guest also, is given each 
year at this time by one of the four 
divisions of the Alumni Federation.
At the present time the Margaret 
Morrison seniors are leading in the 
campaign for membership which ends 
on June 14. Alumni duc^ to seniors, 
if paid before Commencement Day, 
are $2.00. These dues, which entitle 
the member to the Tartan and the 
Carnegie Alumnus for one year, arc 
payable either to the senior solicitors 
or at-the Alumni Qffice. Seniors arc 
equested to  pay bhci-r dues - as soisn, 
as possible.
To the question of "Why join 
the Alumni Association now?" which 
is being asked by many of the seniors 
still enjoying campus life, Director 
William E. Mott replies: "After four 
years of undergraduate life on the 
campus it is hard to realize that a 
few months ina}' mean such a com
plete break with Alma Mater as 
occurs so often in the life of the 
recent graduate. It seems axiomatic 
that a relationship which has been so 
natural will continue without any 
special effort on ones own part.
"Experience has demonstrated that 
this is not the case and it is only 
by a positive effort on the part of 
the majority of the graduates that 
they wiil maintain even a moderate 
amount of.interest in their college.
"In order to make possible the 
maintenance of an effective organ
ization it is the duty of allnot just 
a fewbut of every graduateto 
bccomc a member of the Alumni 
Federation.

Silhouettes Drawn On Walls of Smoking
Room By Inspired Carnegie Decorators
By ROSEMARY SAXTON
The innovation of the smoking 
room in the Women's dormitories 
has brought to light a new art 'in 
the line of interior decoration. 
Shiny black silhouettes sharply 
outlined against the white plaster 
walls adorn the smoking room of 
Forbes Hall. Not only arc these 
silhouettes cleverly constructed, but 
each of them is an accurate pro
file of a resident of the dormitory.
It all began one evening during 
the course of an after-dinner cig
arette when two energetic P. &
D.s conceived the idea of prac
ticing portraiture 011 . the inviting 
blankness of the plastered walls. 
With the aid of a dramat and by
fair means or foul, scene paint was 
secured from the Drama Depart
ment, Within a few hours the 
walls were lined with the likeness 
of each head in the room, as the 
models were eager and willing to 
pose, although it meant holding a 
very motionless head close to the 
wall with a lamp to cast the shade 
which soon became permanent, 
There arc 23 of these gleaming 
black profiles, each with its own 
characteristic up-turned nose, tan
gled lock of hair, or high smooth 
forehead. On the far wall back 
in the shadows, there is plenty of 
room for new faces, so in all 
probability Forbes Hall will some
day have a permanent collection 
of all its illustrious beauties.

Intramural Softball Championship 
Gamos Will Bo Played 
Tonight At 5:30.TARTAN SPORTS PAGE
Final Track Meet of the Season 
with Grove City Thursday 
Afternoon.-J
JOE BRONSON
THE TARTAN TRACKERS were sort of bumped up and 
down the old cinder paths last week when the Skibo runners 
were forced to look at the heels of their opponents on two dif
ferent occasions. The traditional Pitt Panther was the conquerer in the first meet taking the measure of the Scotch on Tues
day evening by the score of 88-47. Saturday the Temple Owls 
left their home in the city of Brotherly Love and arrived in 
Pittsburgh with the "victory cry" on their lips and avenged the 
defeats of their football and basketball teams by trimming the 
Skibo runners 79-50.* * * *
The large crowd of spectators which witnessed the Satur
day contest saw one of the best meets of the year. No less 
than three Track records were broken and two more were tied 
in the course of the afternoon. The 880, the mile, and the two 
jmile marks were broken while 100 yd. dash and the 120 yd. low 
/hurdle times jvere tied. To the Temple Owls goes the credit 
of setting the new records and of tying the Century^ mark 
while Capt. Tom Coulter equaled his last years mark in the 
, Hurdles.-* * * *
Burke of the Carnegie Plebes and Kiger of the Panther 
Frosh put on the most thrilling race of the day in the Pitt 
meet... These two yearlings fought it out the whole way in the 
880 yd. event, and in the last few yards Burke pulled ahead to 
win the race and equal the school mark. This is Burkes first 
year of running and he has already set a course record Cross 
Country.* . * * *
The Tartan Plebes Tennis players scored the first Athletic
victory by the Tartans since the Cross Country season over 
Pitt when they downed the rival Freshmen 4-3 on Monday 
afternoon. The Varsity Racquet wielders ?ifter getting off to 
a fine start dropped three matches in a row last week when 
they were defeated by Pitt, John Hopkins and Georgetown. 
One more match remains to be played and a victory in this 
one will still make it a successful season for the Court Men.* * * *
ANOTHER INTRAMURAL CHAMPIONSHIP seems to 
be in the making for the Kappa Sigs. With but one game to 
be played they have as yet to taste defeat in the softball tourna
ment. Last week they won two exciting games; one with the 
Betas and the other with Rho Damit Rho. In each of these 
contests the Clyde street boys emerged victorious by a 5-'
score. Lou Jagnow, their stellar pitcher, has had his opponents
guessing by virtue of his amazing speed and change of pace, 
The final game of the series will be played tonight with the 
Kappa Sigs meeting Kappa Delta Rho and the Senior Archi
tects playing Rho Darnit Rho.* * * *
THE ANNUAL INTERFRATERNITY SWEEPSTAKES 
camc to a successful close Saturday morning with the Betas 
once again emerging victorious. The race this year was closer 
than usual with all six cars being bundled together until the 
final stretch. Tljc Phi Kappa Psis were in the lead down the 
straight away but were disqualified when George Kavel let go 
of the Buggy before he had crossed the finish mark. The old 
mark of 2 min. 57.5 sec. set by the Betas two years ago was 
broken by three seconds.+ * * if
CARNEIE TECHS COMPETITION IN INTER
COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS comes to a close this week when 
the Tennis Team meets W. & J. on Monday and Guy Halfertys 
Trackers take on , the Grove City runner Thursday. It has 
been oi\e of the most successful seasons in the history of the 
Plaid At.liletics with nlmoBt all of the teams turning in excel
lent recoils.
SKIBOS MEET 
GROVE CITY IN 
TRACK FINALE
Armentrout, Price, Merten 
and Barger in Last Plaid 
Contest
Thursday afternoon in the Bowl 
the Carnegie trackers meet Grove 
City in the seasons windup. To date 
the Tartans boast four wins as 
against three losses and a victory 
over the Crimson would give the 
cinderites a very creditable record 
for the season. Grove City should fall 
before the Tartan onslaught although 
some of the Plaid strength so notice
able at the .first of the season is 
now strangely lacking,
Last year Carnegie had little 
trouble trimming the Grovers and 
advance reports show no great in
crease in Crimson strength. It was in 
this same meet a year ago that Tom 
Coulter established the school mark 
of 49.2 for the 440 and George Ncasc 
tied the "century" mark.
As last years Grove City meet 
wrote finis to the collegiate athletic 
careers of some famous Carnegians, 
so will Thursdays contest ring down 
the curtain on a number of sterling 
Skibo track and field men. Murray 
Armentrout, one of Carnegies great
est all-around athletes and present 
holder of the school hammer throw 
record, will wear the Plaid for the 
last time. Army has also been the 
teams best in the shot this season 
and his graduation will leave a big 
hole in the weight events. Blaine, 
another weight man who has only 
been with the team -for two years, 
and Dick Brindel, who tossed -the 
javelin into many first places, will be 
among the missing next spring.
Ralph Merten and Ray Barger, two 
of Carnegies most versatile field 
men, also make their final bow on 
Thursday. Ray holds the school 
rccbrd in the pole vault and Ralph, 
in addition to being a competent 
vaulter, has piled up many points in 
the high jump and broad jump. Both 
of these men arc performers of 
much greater than average ability, 
and the problem of replacing them 
will indeed be a difficult one.
The Tartan tracksters lose only 
one man from the cinders, but' what 
the team will do without the de
pendable Jess Prices usual two mile 
victory has not yet been decided. 
The ex-cross country captain has been 
Carnegies foremost distance man, 
with the exception of Dykcmnn, pres
ent possessor of the school mile and 
two mill records. Jess, in addition 
to holding the cross country record, 
has seriously threatened the two mile 
mark and may surpass it yet.

Games In Intermural Mushball 
Championship Played Tonight At 5:30
The lengthy struggle for the Intermural softball cup has at last readied 
the climax for tonight the final two 
games of the tournament will be 
played. At the present time the 
Kappa Sigs seem to have the cup 
almost in hand. Thursday night they 
defeated Beta Thcta Pi in a close 
contest by the score of 5-4. Friday 
night they stepped right out and de
feated the up and coming Dorm men 
from Rho Darnit Rho by the same 
score of 5-4. These two victories 
gave them a clear slate for' the win
ners side of the bracket, and yester
day they met the Senior Architects 
who were victors in the losers side. 
The Kappa Sigs should have won 
their game yesterday and their final
game is with the Kappa Delta Rho 
team this evening.
The Architects won their right 
into the finals by defeating the Delta 
Tati Delta nine on Thursday night 
and coming right back on Friday 
to take over the Kappa Delta Rhos 6-5.
In the other games in the semi
final round, the Kappa Delta Rhos 
defeated Tau Delta Phi, and Rho 
Darnit Rho defeated the Phi Kappa's.
In this tournament four teams en
tered the finals two being from each 
side of the brackct. These teams 
were Kappa Sigma, Kappa Delta Rho, 
Senior Architects, and Rho Darnit 
Rho. Each of the four team's is 
scheduled to play each of the othr ones.
Burke Ties School 
Record As Plebes 
Lose To Panthers
Although the Plebes lost to the 
Panther Yearlings, the meet brought 
forth an individual effort which 
 started Carnegie Track men thinking 
of next season. Lawrence 
Burke, sensational Plebe runner and 
holder of the difficult freshman 
cross-country course mark, nosed out 
Kiger of Pitt to win the SS0 yard 
run and tie the school all-time record 
of 2:01.4. Coach Halferty is shy 
when predictions arc in order but 
will watch with interest Burke's progress next season.
Allen won the high hurdles and 
Kopriva copped the lows against 
Pitt. Pcrina had to be content with 
a third in Ihe 100 and a second in 
the 220, but gained some measure of 
revenge by winning the broad jump. 
The Pitt frosh, boasting ex-high 
school stars in almost every event, 
were too strong for our Plebes and 
the showing which Carnegie made 
s satisfactory considering the grade 
, opposition, 
he, Plebes closed their season 
h a 41 to 29 victory over Schcnley 
.igh School. Pcrina was a triple 
winner in this meet by virtue of his 
victories in the 100, 220 and broad 
ump. Burke won the mile run and 
ippriva took the low hurdles. Davis

Poor Weather 
Hinders Golfers 
At First Meet
With the arrangement of a few 
informal matplics and practice ses
sions, Carnegie Tech intercollegi
ate golf is at last taking definite 
shape. Recently Graduate Man 
agcr Overends call for interested 
candidates was answered by some 
twenty enthusiasts and an informal 
match was run off at the Pitts
burgh Field Club. Due to th 
very poor weather, good scorcs were 
impossible, but the showing that 
the contestants made gave prom
ise of furnishing Carnegie with 
competent golfing material if the 
powers tha: be decide that. Tech 
will be represented on the greens 
and fairways next season.
Low scorc for Manager Overends match was turned in by Joel 
Haverstick, a sophomore and one 
of the semi-finalists of last years 
West Penn Tourney. Other golf
ers of local prominence who show
ed some promise are Bob Sigler, 
E.d Reese, A1 Burgoyne and Car
son. All of these plaj^ers have 
had tournament and match experi
ment Avith varying degrees of suc
cess.
After these boys have practiced 
more and have been tested in col
legiate competition, the status of 
golf at Carnegie will be better 
known. At present, however, Mr. 
Overend is pleased with the inter
est and enthusiasm shown in the 
sport and from all indications Car
negie will add golf to her list of sports.

The Tartan tracksters lost an
other meet to Pitt last Tuesday,, 
when the Panthers romped off with 
points while Carnegie was gar
nering 47. Some consolation is 
due Tech in that her stellar cap
tain, Totn Coulter, camc home 
with individual honors. Tom won 
both high and low hurdles in good 
time and then pushed Woody Har
ris, colored sprint star, to a fast 
21.8 in the 220 yard dash.
In all, Tech annexed five firsts 
as well as a tic for first three seconds, 
and numerous thirds. Jess Price clip
ped off the fastest two-mile of his 
career when lie broke the tape in 
10:03, far in front of the nearest 
Panther rival. Murray Armen
trout got off a beautiful throw and 
tossed the' big ball and chain 131 
feet to win his event. Bargers 
11 feet 6 inches winning vault was 
his best effort of the year and 
marks Rays second victory in -two 
years over Pitt competitors. Car
negies tic for first place was gain
ed by Merten |n the high jump. 
Lew Ewing and Wilbur Ramsay 
both ran good races in the 440 
and mile respectively, but the op1 
position was of such a caliber that 
they were forced to accept third 
place,

Always a lot of it, now

wou! ,d be doing something and 
^lll? , lose my name of being idle.
* * * .*
At last I found out where I 
stood in regards to my work for 
the year. Believe it or not, but I 
rate P Qs in all my subjects. The 
Fs and Rs prevail in every in
stance. It wasnt at all what I 
expected would happen. I did think 
I would get through on the skin 
of my teeth, at least, but 
Now I will have to take all the 
courses over again next year. 
V/hats a poor fellow going to do? 
Everybody is down on me. I 
tried to be congenial, but it didnt 
help me one bit. The day of 
judgment came and found me 
wanting. So, there you are; dont 
make the same mistake that I did.
Sure, Im coming back next 
year. How could I do otherwise^: 
,1 made the flunking grades men
tioned above, so I will be one to 
,1 /register in the fall and sign on 
the dotted line. I am, however, 
going to >look up some of the 
courses which arc given in the 
Arts school. It may be that I can 
pass them, but as an engineer, I 
assure you that I would make a 
better architect. They deal in froz
en music, and when it comes to 
harmony, it takes physics to tell 
. you how many cadenzas there arc 
in Offenbachs Tales of Hoffman.jV Physics; you know, is a 
subject dear to the heart of an 
engineer and in the course of 
0f this subject, one is ex
posed  to t'lc phenomena of sound, 
and soi ,nd is a musical tone, which 
all lea ds to a cadenza. Yes, we engiiii^ccrs certainly can .show the 
tv ay t0 knowledge. Our slo,gan >s Engineers lead the way, 
but I . here to be showndidnt 
I fail.

LOST
Embarrassing 
Moments At 
Carnegie Tech
The night we asked custodian 
Kap of the Arts School if it was 
going to rain, and received the 
ironical reply: "It will if it comes 
down.
The night of a sudden down 
pour, when we rushed to shelter 
beneath the circular entrance to 
Margaret Morrison College, and 
found that it is uncovered.
The night at the Forbes street 
shelter when someone called us : 
wart, and we never saw the cul
prit before (or after).
The night that Professor Warner 
was shown an article of our con
coction in the Plaid, describing 
him as completely bald, and he 
condemned it as gross exaggera
tion because he still has his eye
brows left.
The night everybody was inquir
ing of everyone else who the night 
art critic is, and we were so con 
spicuous at a time when detection 
might have been fatal.

UNMANAGEABLE DOORS
(Continued from Page One) 
against the door, a brawny, footballish-looking person arrived. He 
grasped the offending door and 
heaved it open as if it were a 
mere screen door. We were ready 
to step through and to smile our 
grateful thartks when he walked 
on, leaving us stand there, gazing 
vacantly at the closed door.
Another door which almost ex
cites us to wrath is the front door 
Maggie Murph. Theres somequeer about it; we dont 
quite trust double doors of which 
only the left one opens. We have 
a feeling way down deep, that 
when we come back as alumni, 
well niakc the horrid mistake of 
pulling on the side'of the.door that 
is firmly and permanently closed. 
And wC have never ceased to be 
awed by the imtnCnse door 'way 
back by the ' discreetly hidden 
smoking room:
Being a very loyal Maggie 
Murph, we preserve the tradi
tional, somewhat cynical, attitude 
toward Art, students and their 
school. There is one thing, how
ever,"whicli we gladly concede to 
themthe supremacy of their front 
door. When the wind is not 
strong, and there are not many 
people passing in and out, a 
healthy tug at the outer door will 
make an air-pocket or something 
which causes the inner door to 
open all by itself. We hereby 
offer homage to the powers that 
executed such an arrangement, and 
We Earnestly hope that they soon 
get to work on the entrance to 
Administration Hall.

Powys, Successful 
Author, Departs 
For Parts Unknown
John Cowpcr Powys has left for 
parts unknown. Gone to lead the life 
of a hermit, a recluse. Many readers 
of Powys books have beendelighted 
in the past by his clear, lucid, and 
unusual writings - on a wide range 
of subjects. The readers of his "King 
Lear, David Coppcrficld, The 
Possessed, and Wulhcring Heights, 
Were no doubt pleased to hear that 
he was publishing a new book. Al
most simultaneously came the sudden 
announcement that Powys was leav
ing his New York farm, where he 
had spent three years in writing his 
latest book, and was going away to 
live by himself far from the taint 
and restraint of the masses. The 
desire for solitude and leisure in 
order to think out the many and 
fine thoughts which constantly sweep, 
through his brain has no doubt 
brought about this sudden shift of 
action. No man of Powys ability 
would stoop to such a move in order 
to secure publicity or acclaim. His 
works have already done this for 
him.
PoWys treatment of a subject 
smacksof philosophical romanticism.. 
He leads one through by-ways that 
the reader often felt existed but 
which 'he has never been able to 
find unaided. He has a sweeping 
style and a piercing vision that looks 
into the core of -things and presents 
them as they really arc. "A Glaston
bury Romance," his latest work is a 
talc of life in and around Glaston
bury, the home of the ancient Druids 
in England. It took three years to 
write this melodramatic version of 
present day lifein a region belonging 
to the mystic past. Comedy, tragedy, 
triumph, and despair arc, all com
bined to show the eternal struggle be
tween good and evil.
Powys has gone to live the life of 
a hermit. He has gone away so that 
he may live the lazy, carefree life 
which he loves so wellfree from 
the petty cares and annoyances of a 
mechanized and realistic age. This 
does not mean that his genius will 
become atrophied, lost, to those who 
admire him. Out of the wilds and 
depths in which he seeks the soli-: 
tude he craves there will conic some 
day more; of his. writings; writings 
combining the wisdom of prophet and 
seer. And maybe someday Powys 
will return to the world which has 
acclaimed 'him; return to seek again 
amids.t the mazes of life the truths 
which are hidden from all but the 
clcctcd few. But whether he returns 
or whether he. remains hidden away 
from the world, Powys has left be
hind him enduring monuments to his 
genius.

EDUCATION
The steady drone of collegc life 
gods on like some giant bumble-bee 
winging his way through the swectsccnted honeysuckle. Just a few short 
weeks and this life will ccasc, and 
out of the jaws of the institutes of 
learning, colleges and universities, 
will be expelled the thousands of 
eager but ignorant-of-lifc men and 
women who will have to face the 
problems of living and a thousand 
and one attendant details. Most of 
the chaff of college learning will 
have to be discarded and the few 
kernels of learning and wisdom will 
be carefully held and treasured. Some 
wont even have the kernelsjust the 
chaff.
Four years! Four years in a hot
house atmosphere and 'then the cold 
blighting winds of the open fields. 
The transplanting will accentuate the 
hardy stalks, but the weak (so many 
of them) will fail under the strain, 
shrivel and die. Some have the idea 
that cramming facts is the thing, 
others can solve any problem or 
make dozens of tests, still others 
know whole books of words and 
lines, but that proves nothing. More 
and more it will become evident that 
the art of living is the primary im
pulse which should be obeyed and 
catered to. What is the value of all 
of our devices of civilization if we 
neglect the true end of all our effort? 
Of what avail is it to build our
selves tools only to find that they 
cannot be used for the job? Is it 
right to build palaces for beggars, 
or golden thrones for dogs to lie 
upon?
Not that it is the job of tile col
leges to teach its students these es
sentials, but the}' can in a measure 
help along in the process. The es
sential thing is to make students 
realize that what they have learned 
is but a prelude to lifes song; an 
overture that tempts the listener with 
a vague delight and promises much 
in the later passages. This is the 
value of education. A fine tool to be 
used in turning out a good job, noth
ing more. When this is learned, and 
when an honest effort ismade to 
apply our imaginations, and when 
we awaken our inherent resources to 
seeking the hidden. delights of life, 
then, and only then will we have a 
civilization and a culture comparable 
to those of the past.
Inter-Night ­­College 
Dance Big Success
A beautiful evening, delightful 
music, and elaborate dccoraiions were 
all combined to make the InterNight College dance held recently 
in the gymnasium a gala event and 
an outstanring sitcccss.
Never before have decorations cxcccdcd these in novelty and grandeur. 
Lighting effects that were both un
usual and decorative have never been 
attempted on such a large scale, and 
the part they played in enhancing 
the gaycty of the evening attests to 
the originality of the night group who 
arc always striving for the unusual 
in decorations.
Numerous colored spotlights were 
focused at various angles upon.a re
volving sphere suspended high over 
the center of the floor and Studded 
with a myriad of tiny mirrors that 
reflected light like phantom snow
flakes. Many colored lights that gave 
a warmth and variety to an other
wise monotonus surface flooded the 
surrounding walls, while powerful 
flood lights, ingeniously placed under 
the stage threw out rays at inter
vals when all other lights were 
darkened.
Hundreds of many eolored balloons 
and pcnants were strung in dazzling 
fashion high over the floor and at 
the proper moment the balloons were 
released upon the dancers who 
fought with great zest to recover 
as many as possible of them, mean
while thenoise of bursting rubber 
spheres sounded not unlike a minia
ture war.
Carl Ludwig and his popular band 
upheld their reputation as one of the 
finest orchestras to appear on the 
campus. Tremendous rounds of ap
plause after each dance number at
tested to the big hit that they made 
with the dancers.
It is with a tinge of regret we 
recall that this is the last dance of 
the season but we look forward with 
pleasant anticipation to the renewals 
next year, and in the words of an
other, well be "sccnya.

to which any Carnegie students

VACATIONS
Theoretically the night students arc 
enjoying a vacation. Be that as it 
may, several things seem to point 
to the fact that a night students 
vacation is a more or less chimerical 
period, during which his evenings arc 
ruined by a feeling ofguilt for 
wasting so much time, and awaken
ing in the middle of the night won
dering about which assignment lie 
forgot to work out before retiring.
Perhaps, in fact, certainly, the 
large .majority of the night students 
are not affected so badly, but never
theless, most of them will, admit 
that after the first few nights of 
idleness, there is a somewhat vague 
feeling of unrest which crccps into 
their minds that certainly doesnt 
help them enjoy life any more. Per
haps this all seems far fctchcd, but, 
from personal cxpcrienccs and inter
views with fellow students, the idea 
seems to prevail. It is fortunate that 
most of us really .need the vacation 
period to rest a bit, and,we quiet our' 
conscicnccs by arguing that way, 
otherwise the lctrdown following 
the first elated feeling after the last 
night of school might have disastrous 
consequences. In fact, it might make 
some of us crazier than we arc at 
present.
Speaking of vacations, it is surpris
ing the number of students who ar? 
doing a considerable amount of sparetime work in an effort to booster up 
the exchequer which has suffered con
siderably during the past two years 
of booming business. Aside from 
the financial advantages accruing to 
an evening position in addition to 
their daytime work, the night students 
find a way to remove the restless 
feeling by doing something.
Unfortunately this restlessness docs 
not get in its evil work until the 
time for registration in the supple
mentary term classcs is at least two 
weeks past, so that strenuous and 
sudden efforts have to be made in 
order that we wont feel too idle. 
However, most of us find that tennis, 
dates, sleeping for a change, reading, 
and a lot of other things that wore 
sacrificed during the school term 
supply us with sufficient food for 
thought to prevent our doing any
thing rash. 1
Tickets For Dances 
Should Be Cleared
There arc a number of tickcts 
for cach of the four dances held 
by. the Night Student Council 
which have not been cleared. It 
is important that these tickcts be 
settled for, so that credit can be 
given to the students for the same. 
Returns should be made to Henry 
If.. Mauro, Treasurer, Night Stu

feeling, when the time comes for senior farewells one must 
admit a certain amount of sentimentality.
;t With this issue the senior staff of the Tartan takes its 
final bow, for , once again the old order must give way to 
the new. It ahvays seems somewhat ironical that a group 
should spend four years gaining experience in handling the 
school affairs and just when they are becoming of real 
vajue, along comes graduation which transplants them into 
new fields where again they begin as a cub reporter. 
The Tartan is a great teacher and as such undoubtedly con
tributes more to the education of its staff than they to the 
advance of the paper. The removal of anything so. definitely 
a part of ones existence as the work on the Tartan be
comes, leaves a quite a void in the minds of the senior 
staff. 
The present school year when viewed somewhat in 
retrospect appears to be one of more than ordinary achieve
ment. The campus has developed somewhat on the exterior 
but considerably more so in spirit and tradition. Both the 
school and' the newspaper integral with it appear to have 
been progressive enough to make their position increasing
ly'secure. May they continue to do so.
But little remains other than to express appreciation 
for the kindness and interest of those, who have made our 
work as fruitful and enjoyable as it has been. To the 
incoming staff members we wish 'the best of success in 
their most interesting adventure.

The Spring Carnival
The Spring Carnival Committee is to be highly com
mended for its splendid work in (lie planning -of this years 
Spring Carnival, it was one of the most successful car
nivals held since the revival of the annual good time several 
years ago. Student interest in all of the events, especially 
the roller skate races and float competition, new features on 
1 he program, should prove gratifying to the committee, 
which has worked zealously for more than a month.
Deserving ofespecial praise is the work of the Bac
chanalians, a newly formed organization on the campus, in 
presenting the satirical revue Tar and Feathers, Saturday 
night. The revue was one of the high lights of the carnival 
revue. It had al^ of the characteristics of a hilarious pro
fessional presentation.
The committee has given Carnegie a spring carnival 
. filled with good clean fun which will be remembered for 
years as one of the best.
The Passing of the Subsidized Athlete
Last week the Middle States Association of Colleges 
and Secondard Schools, an association of the leading col
leges -and universities of New York, Pennsylvania, New
 Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, 
announced that it was opposed to the subsidation of ath
letes and adopted resolutions which after September, 1933, 
will exclude from its approved list schools which continue 
to give scholarships for athletic achievements alone after 
that'date. This move is the result of the financial difficul
ties many colleges and universitieshave experienced with 
their athletic programs during the past several years.
........JFor sometime it has erroneously been believed that a
school must have winning athletic teams to attract stu
dent's. The fallacy of this belief was recently shown in 
this .column. As a result, many institutions have spent 
tremendous amounts of money building mammoth stadiums, 
until through necessity, college athletics have become a 
commercialized proposition. It is openly admitted.at many
 schools that football is the only paying sport and that 
enough money must be made during the football season to 
iirjah.ee all other athletic teams. Smaller gate receipts dur
ing the past few years and a decided reduction in donation's 
usually given by wealthy alumni have caused a curtailment 
ill the giving of athletic scholarships, and some schools 
have ;gpnc to the extent of entirely abolishing the practice. 
It;.is safe to predict that quite a number of the colleges 
which have so .boldly dispensed with athletic subsidation 
will not have winning teams within a few years, unless 
i\iatiy more schools, adopt the same policies. The move 
taken bv the Middle States Association is a definite step 
in an attempt to force the wide-spread abolition of athletic 
scholarships.
When college athletics become a matter of dollars and 
cents to participants, their real purpose has been defeated. 
But a . few days ago several athletes withdrew from com-, 
petition on an athletic team in one of the smaller colleges 
in Western Pennsylvania because the administration .had 
abolished athletic scholarships. What has become of the 
spirit of athletic achievements and the zeal for competi
tion ? '
Athletics, as are all campus activities, are planned for 
the benefit of the students, who in all institutions naturally 
have diverse interests. Why, then, should athletes be lured

FROM THE FENCE
A Perfect Carnival
The Carnegie Spring Carnival lias come greatly anticipated and has gone as probably the most successful of all Carnegie Carnivals. No end of credit is due to WillHolloway and his very capable committee. They presented a well organized program of splendid entertainment that gave the students the biggest $1.50 worth theyll ever see. And on top. of all. that a very gorgeous and gracious Queen to rule the .festivities. The whole affair could leave nothing but pleasant memories for those who participated, a marked contrast to a similar festive period at a nearby college.* * * *
For the Scrap Book
Thoughts of school work -.thrown iar.away late Thursday afternoon. All set'for a couple of days of carefree "college life as pictured in stories and movies and as found-in small colliches. . . . A gorgeous evening that, an . author. could-waste half 
a novel in describing. . . . Were wc ever surprised at finding, an honcst-to-goodness 'fountain trickling up among ferns in the middle of the Gym floor. With the-waterworks and many varicolored lights 
theveryathletic gymnasium was transformed into a rather, nice ballroom after the roughness was worn out of the floor. . Marshal-Field and Co. managed to keep the Gym well heated with their music. . . . The exotic , modcrne Thistle Hall crammed with dancers easin around to Jack Bruces, very swell daiice music:' Say, can he do faultless imitations of all types of dance music from Cab Calloways torrid tunes to Guy Lombardos rythm and Wayne Kings wavy waltzers?! Then that. grand Mood Indigo .every sooften. Not much wonder the Intcrsorority wfeht wild over 
him. ...* * * *
Third and Last Day
Those that woke up Saturday morning and were able to get to the campus saw the imposing R. O. T. C. review and the thrilling finals of the sweepstakes classic. . . . Saturday afternoon saw the presentation of awards and the selection of next 3rears big shots. The Kappa: Sigs rather cornered a large percentage of the awards.. Sid Krasik -was well chosen as the outstanding senior engineer. . . . Say, could they get funny noises out of that public address system. The noise at the 
call to: Cwcns sounded like a tiger's, roar... ...* * * *
Mary, Queen of Scots, Crowned
As quite a delightful change from the fairy tale coronation pageants of past years this time Ave had a peppy crowning in the modern manner. What with stompin Russian dancin, a "knock, down and drag out German jig, nice English (?) croonin, and vododeodo American highkicking. The Queen chose 
the American type but we prefer the Teuton type. . . .The crown was very nice and all that but a bit in the way while dancing, so the King carried it on his arm while shoving the Queen around among the dancers. . ..* _ * * *
Hey! Hey Day!
The day. of abandon, hey, and joy unrefined started off with a bang with dashing sweepstakes races that caused plenty of thrills and heartthrobs. The Betas trick. tricycle was destined to win the finals in a new record time of 2:54.8. The Phi Psi car crossed the finish ; line. first but did it so. easily that it didn't need a pusher at the finish so was' disqualified. ... The afternoon program wasinaugurated with, heat roller skate races.
Mellon Hall managed to get a member among the first three in each heat so . ran away with the cup. . . . The Parade of Floats had any sideshow you ever saw backed way off the map. The S. A. E.s had a real water wagon trying to' clear up false impressions but well bet there wasnt any water in it. . . . The T. X. dormitory, scene was very typical. . . . The Birch Stables float' had all the trimmings, steps and all. At the end of the parade one of the school workmen dove through the false steps and lost plenty of skin. ... Th farmer Dlts were there a such. ... The Alpha Sigs must have dug deep to unearth such an antique fire 
ciigine. . . .ThePhi Kaps ' Indians must; have been trainingfor weeks to ke.ep up their war dance so long without biting dust, from exhaustian rather than from cap pistol wounds. Custers horse wasgreat.. . . The Packard load of gangsters look j,ust that. Sorry we werent around earlier. Frank Len.nb.etg of the local motor-moUnted police succumbs easily .to the lure of lucre. . . . The raditor cap girl on the Music float had a real job. . . . Well bet you never saw a horse coasting downhill onroller skates before, wot? ... A splendid team the D. U.s had for their chariot. The mule half must haye been harnessed so tight to save the chariotfrom destruction. . . . Did the Sigma Nu.s .everhave fun with their short wheelbase Phord? 1 And did they take, the Librarians for a rid? . .. . No, sir, theres nothing ..like I-Iey day. . . .* * * *
Mardi Gras!
Early in the evening of the costume ball most of those present did not have costumes and it looked like any informal dancq. But a littljtt came kiddies, peasants, cosmopolitans, cowboys and Indians, Hindus, Time to Retires, white robed Greeks, Hula Hulas, Suthern Cunels, nightshirts, pajamas, flour bag suits, Spaniards, sailors, .. ct cetera, and so forth, etc. . . .The cowboys periodically shot up the place. . . The Indians broke out with a massacre ever and anon. . .  The costume ball was a grand finale to a day of hey. . . .* * * *
Tar and Feathers
Of course the title had nothing -what-so-ever to do with the revue Saturday night. We mentioned before that the revue was sure to be a $4.40 attraction. It was better than that; it was at least a 
$6.60 attraction. It was no end of improvement over the old Campus Week shows. If the sponsoring group is not recognized after that noble effort there are plenty of less deserving organizations that should be elected to oblivion. Herewith arc bouquets for all that had, anything to do with the very successful Tar and Feathers. . ... TheCarnival was brought to a dose with a fine ceremony in the Sylvan theater thus bringing, to an end not a practically perfect Carnival but a wholly perfect Carnival. . . .* * * *
Note
We wish to say that We nevqr'before in our lift saw the fellow in the picture on the backJ page of last weeks Tartan. It must have been a typographical error. We also wish to thank the many conscious and unconscious contributors to the colyum during the past year. Also many thrix to.June Fuhs who has done much of the cartoon work herewith presented, just for the devil of it. : Orbin has turned athletic! His hurdles at the front of Machinery Hall are swell, but a little too high for any Carnegians bronching Lizzie. Its a good idea, though. Whats next?
to college by athletic scholarships when students with the 
same degree of "ability in other extra-curriculum activities 
are not enticed with publication scholarships and the like?
The ideal situation would not call for the complete 
abolition of scholarships for athletes who have accom
plished-proficiency, for surely athletes are entitled to finan
cial aid if other students in extra-curriculum activities are. 
A plan which might be offered' to supplant the present 
method of subsidationone. which should meet with the 
approval of the Middle States Associationwould provide 
for the awarding of scholarships to juniors and seniors who 
have shown ability, interest, and sportsmanship in athletics. 
This plan would follow the s^me .used; in awarding scholar
ships for scholastic attainments, as. well as - the customary 
method of; paying salaries to students, usually seniors, who 
head college publications. \
If such a plan were widely adopted by associations 
throughout, the country,-, much would be accomplished to
ward restoring 'coilege athletics to -a level which is not 
tainted with aspects of commercialization. Athletes who 
care little about academic work would not have an artificial 
incentive ;to enter college only, to' 'find that they cannot main
tain the scholastic eligibility requirements. After all, 
scholarship should be considered -first and extra-curriculum 
activities second.
AN APPRECIATION
The Spring Carnival Committee wishes to thank the many people responsible for the successful Carnival of last week. Without their untiring energy and the co-operation of the students attending the various functions, we feel that the Spring Carnival would have been doomed forever. To Colonel Fairley and Mr. Orbin, ,we are exceptional grateful for their ceaseless efforts to help the committee at all times. To the social fraternities, honorary organizations, mens and womens dormitories, we are thankful for the spirit with which they responded to the program. And to the members of the cast of Tar and Feathers and the others responsible for the musical revue, we wish to expres sour exceptional gratitude for the unending work and co-operation which they put into their work.
We hope that the number of students attending future Carnivals will increase each year, for we feel that nowhere can there be found the entertainment afforded by the very reasonable rates offered in the past.
