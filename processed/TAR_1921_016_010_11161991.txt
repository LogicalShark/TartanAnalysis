Articles of Interest to All 
Make Issue Attractive
Today marks the beginning of the Tech Branch Y. M. C. A. membership 
enrollment in the three mens colleges, and with about one-sixth of the men 
of Tech already behind the movement, its success is assured.
At an organization supper last night almost three hundred of the male 
students of Carnegie pledged their support to the enrollment campaign, not 
only by enrolling themselves, but by agreeing to interview five men each in 
their respective sections in the interest of the Y. The canvassers re
ceived many helpful suggestions from 
the speakers of the evening, who 
were Pittsburgh men actively inter
ested in Y. M. C. A. work.
C. P. Johnson is chairman of the 
student enrollment committee and 
Hedluad, Kothe and Ray are the di
rectors in Science, Industries and 
Arts, respectively. Under these men 
is an organization consisting of class 
presidents, section leaders and indi
vidual canvassers who have been as
signed to five men in their sections.
It is the plan of the committees to 
make this enrollment 100 per cent.
It has been left entirely up to the 
individual what he should pay as a 
membership fee, and this amount, no 
matter how large or small, may be 
paid in full at the time of subscrip
tion or in installments as-late as Jan
uary or February.
The metropolitan Y. M. C. A. of 
Pittsburgh has contributed .$1,000 in 
order that the work might have an 
unhampered start, but $2,500 addi
tional is necessary to carry on the 
work throughout the year. This 
amount is to be raised through the 
membership enrollment among those 
of the student, faculty and alumni 
bodies who believe in the Y. M. C. A. 
and are earnestly interested in see
ing it established as a permanent in
stitution at Tech.
The Tech Branch Y. M. C. A. is 
for every Tech man regardless of 
race, nationality or creed, it is an 
institution which can have none but 
a beneficial influence on life at Tech 
and this influence will be measured 
by the extent of the support which it 
receives from the student body.
The committees and individual can
vassers are hard at work today and 
by tomorrow evening every man in 
the day schools will have been inter
viewed.
This is the critical period for the 
Tech Y. M. C. A, but once it is pass
ed, the "Y will be permanently es
tablished and another milestone in 
the development of a greater Tech 
will have been reached.
Join the "Y and help serve Tech.
Make Tech as famous for the char
acter of her graduates as for their 
professional ability or athletic pow
ers. THINK IT OVER.
CARNEGIE DAY PARTY
IN ARTS FOYER
Observation of Carnegie Day this 
year will take the form of a party 
to be held in the Arts School foyer 
on .Friday evening, November 26 
It promises to be one of the most 
enjoyable events of the school year. 
Dr. Baker is general chairman of 
the committee in charge of the pro
gram and arrangements. The en
tertainment will consist of dancing 
in the foyer and various stunts in 
the Little Theater.
Allan Bright, Nation and Burko 
are in charge of the dance and have 
arranged to have Hughes augmented 
orchestra furnish the music. The 
orchestra has several unusual and 
attractive features worked up for 
presentation. It will be the biggest 
and best" orchestras that has ap
peared on the campus for several 
years.
The entertainment committee, con
sisting of Reid, Walton and Mc
Clure, have been working hard with 
the result that they have some in
teresting and entertaining stunts to 
offer. However they have room for 
a few more stunts and anyone hav
ing any suggestions for further 
stunts should give them to Carl 
Reid. Publicity for the day is in 
charge of Blesch, Unzicker and Tilbrok.
This day has been arranged for 
by the Administration and is free 
to all students at Carnegie Tecii. 
Tickets can be ' secured at Dr 
Bakers office any day between the 
hours of twelve and one.
CITMAS CLUB TO MEET
The Citmas Club will hold their 
regular business meeting next Thurs
day evening 8 p. m., in the Y. M. C. 
A. club room.
INDUSTRIES SOPHOMORE
CLASS MEETING
The Sophs in the College of In
dustries held a class meeting Tueday, November 8, In Room 104, Ind. 
President Bob" Smith urged the 
Sophs to enforce the Plebe regula
tions more strictly and to see that 
the Freshmen all attended the as
semblies. Plans for holding a three 
school Sopl; banquet were discussed 
and it is hoped that this plan will 
materialize. The Sophomores decided 
to hold weekly meetings.
The first issue of the C. I. T. Tech
nical Journal will make its appear
ance on the campus tomorrow. Em
barking upon the second year of its 
career with many improvements our 
contemporary is well on the road to 
success and as a permanent part of 
the institution has come to stay. The 
change to a larger size of paper is 
quite pleasing and gives added pres
tige to the publication as a Techni
cal magazine. Tappan Collins is at 
the helm this year as Editor-in-Chief.
A new addition to the staff of 
great importance is found in the per
son of Mr. P. S. Donnell M( E. E., of 
the Department of Electrical Engi
neering as faculty associate., As an un
dergraduate at Harvard Mr. Donnell 
was manager of the Technical Journal 
of the institution and his experience 
with one of the foremost and oldest 
publications of that nature will prove 
a valuable asset to our Journal. Aside 
from this he has had a wide and 
varied experience in the engineering 
world which will aid materially in 
producng a magazine second to none. 
Articles by Engineers and Students.
There is one article at least of in
terest to every student in the institu
tion, while many will find the entire 
issue invaluable. The high spot is 
perhaps to be found in an article by 
Mr. E. B. Roberts, Educational De
partment, Westingliouse Electric and 
Manufacturing Company, entitled: 
"Electrical Engineering in a Manufac
turing Organization, and written by 
special request. He outlines briefly 
the development of electricity in its 
various branches and from this points 
out the places and divisions which the 
Technical graduate may fill. While 
written primarily for students of elec
trical engineering, Mr. Roberts shows 
how the placement of liien in the 
other branches of engineering pre
sents a problem quite analogous.
Colonel Bingham, director of the 
Division of Co-operative Research, 
enlightens us in the activities of that 
department and a careful perusal of 
his article leaves one with the im
pression that Tech is actually en
gaged in a new work quite distinc
tive. He outlines briefly the need 
for such research as is being under
taken, describes the various branches 
of research and finally enumerates 
some examples af active work which 
has either been completed or Is still 
under way.
The Technical Man and the Army 
sets forth the opportunities open to 
the recent graduate in the service of 
his country as a result of a change 
in policy and for those to whom such 
a profession may appeal the article is 
replete with valuable Information.
That the Journal is as much a stu
dent affair as anything else Is shown 
in the appearance of a very ingeni
ous article by W. W. MacAlpine, 22, 
entitled, The Ringing of Church 
Chimes. A concrete example is dealt 
with and while the average person 
may have the impression that the 
task is an easy one, he mil find after 
a study of the problem with the au
thor that the solution was realized 
only through the cleverness and In
genuity of the engineer. Unique in it
self the article is well written and 
deserves the attention of all readers.
Aside from these high spots there 
are numerous other articles of inter
est to all along .with several depart
ments, including editorials, faculty 
notes and alumni notes. The maga
zine as a whole compares most favor
ably with those published by other 
colleges and in existence long before 
the project was launched at Tech.
Should the magaine continue to im
prove as this issue has over those of 
last year it is destined to become an 
important factor at the institution, 
and no one has any excuse for failing 
to plpce a copy of this first issue on 
his desk top.

That world history is being made 
because French engineers in charge 
of the coal mines of the Saar Basin 
have been trained to get along well 
with human beings, was the state
ment made at General Assembly last 
Wednesday by Whiting Williams, 
formerly vice president of the Hy
draulic Steel Company of Cleveland 
Says Mr. Williams:
The Saar Basin in Germany: 
This district was taken from Ger 
many to be governed by the League 
of Nations for fifteen years, and the 
coal mines put under the control of 
the French government, In return 
for the damage done the coal mines 
at Lens in north France. As a 
worker among them, I found the mi
ners very busy on the job. Part of 
the reason was that they were tyeing 
paid in francs, and receiving there
for a much greater number cf 
marks per day than thoir fellow 
German miners up in the Ruhr 
Basin around Essen. Another big 
reason was that French engineers 
are trained1 to visit the bottom of 
the mines every day, and to taik 
with the miners for overcoming the 
mental as well as the physical obs
tacles of daily operation. This tho 
German engineers seldom did.
Mr. Williams spent the summer 
working in the mines aud steel 
plants of France, and tried to get 
a job at Krupps, but was rofused. 
He continued:
Less Unemployment in Europe. 
Both France and Germany have 
considerably less unemployment than 
America or Great Britain. The bigbest thing about Germany is its un
certainty as to the future, it Is 
very far, in my opinion, from being 
back to normal.
In all these countries, as In Great 
Britain, where I worked last sum
mer as a laborer, tho working men 
discuss international relations and 
politics much more than we do 
here. This is because good interna
tional relations mean steady jobs. 
The biggest cause of unrest today 
is tho world-wide joblessness. Be
cause it is world-wide in its. causos,
I believe It will need world-wldo and 
concerted treatment for Its cure. 1 
was happy to find that Prime Min
ister Briand agreed with this. In

The annual varsity clan banquet 
will be held in the cafeteria Saturday 
following the Maryland game at 6:30. 
All students are invited. The cost 
will be about $2.50 a plate. Tho 
squad will be guests and at this time 
the next vears captain will be elect

ception for Coach Steffens. There 
will be some prominent speakers 
present. All students aro urged to 
attend.
Following the banquet there will 
be a football smoker and rally at the 
Union. A good program has also 
been arranged for the event. Tags

THREE ONE ACTS BY 
DRAMATS THURS., SAT.
DEBATE TRYOUT ON 
PANAMA CANAL TOLLS
On November 18 the Tech De
bating Society will havo its third 
meeting of the year. At this meet
ing there will be a qualifying de
bate on the question, Resolved that 
United States coastwise vessels 
should not pay toll through the 
Panama Canal. All men qualifying 
are eligible to the debating society. 
At this meeting certain revisions to 
last years constitution will be mad*1..
. Debating has started periodically 
at Tech only to die from want of 
support. Last year Mr. Peterson 
developed a team from green ma
terial which made a very creditable 
showing against W. & J. and Wes: 
Virginia. This year with an earlier 
start and some of last years men 
as nucleus we should turn out a 
very capable team.
With an enviable record in foot
ball and other athletic sports there 
is no reason why we should not 
have a good record in debating, a 
leading non-athletic activity.
One of the most frequent com
plaints made by employers of tech
nical men, Tech graduates included 
is their inability 'to talk in public 
os even to make an oral report. 
This is a condition that should b 
remedied and can be remedied most 
effectively through debating. So, 
if you have ever debated or think 
you have ability come out for your 
own sake as. well as for dear old 
Tech. If you cannot make the team 
come out to the meets. We need 
you.
Y. M. C. A. ACTIVITIES
Y SWIM TONIGHT
What promises, to be a program of 
unusual interest and entertainment 
are the performances to bo given by 
the drama department in the theater 
of tho Fine Arts building, Thursday 
and Saturday nights of this weolc, 
November 17 and 19.
The evening can be well spent wit
nessing the throe one-act plays that 
will comprise the evening bill. This 
is the first of the many like perform
ances to follow, when the entire pro
duction will be dovoted to worth
while one-act plays. Many of our mod
ern and oven past dramatists havo 
found the onc-act play a good medium 
for expressing' some wonderful Inci
dents or a story that could not fill 
the bounds of a full evening show, 
and thus giving us many flno and 
worth-while stories that might other
wise have beon lost or usod for short 
stories.
Tho three playfota to bo given this 
week are especially fine and enter
taining. "King Renes Daughter/ tho 
first of tho three, tells passionately 
the story of a blind girl who gains her 
sight through love and her own will 
power. It Is a costume play with a 
very large cast and mnsslvo stngo 
settings. Equally as much attontlon 
is being givon to the production side 
of these ono-acts us given a full ovonings show.
The Poem of David, tho socohd 
on tho bill, Is a remarkable ploco of 
modern roallsm. It tolls tho story of 
an old blind man living in tho Ghetto 
of Chicago. Ho Is a firm bollovor of 
Marionettes and tho Hollinoss of Art, 
and even though, his daughter baa 
married a Gentile, his principles re
main the name. This Is ono of tho 
strongest and most emotional plays 
ever given on tho Tech stago. Those 
who come looking for a flno modem 
play will find it in tho "Poem of Da
vid.
The closing number Is a very flno 
fantasy written by Mr. Kennedy of 
the Science school. It is a very amus
ing farce done in a very amusing 
set, and called "Love the Locksmith.
These productions promise to bo 
very successful and ought to give 
much enjoyment to the large number 
of people who have been attending 
the performances. Tickets can be ob
tained at Dr. Baker's office, Central 
building.
Tonight at 7:00 p. m., the weekly 
Y SWjm -will be held at the 
Schenley High School. The swim 
last week was largely attended but 
even more can be accommodated. 
The Y. M. C. A. has provided for 
instructing those who cant Bwim.
CLUB ROOM
All organizations wishing to use 
the Y club room 12-A, Industries 
Building, may do so by making res

SIX HUNDRED THISTLES SOLD
The Thistle Sales manager reports 
that about six hundred copies of the 
Thistle have been sold to date. How
ever, the Sales Campaign has not 
met with the response that is wished, 
as it is desired that fifteen hundred 
copies be sold in order to secure the 
financial success of the publication. 
But Theres a Reason.
The Sales Campaign has never been 
carried on so early during the school 
year and this coupled with the finan
cial condition around school has had 
considerable effect on the sales of 
the Thistles. With money so scarce 
and a raise in tuition it is no wonder 
that the students think a while be
fore Investing. And then it is pos
sible that some of the Plebes that 
might buy havent been here long 
enough to learn what the Thistle 
really is and what It meanB to them 
to have one.
The Sales Campaign officially end-' 
ed two weeks ago. It was short and 
snappy. A committee was appointed 
from each school to personally carry 
on these sales. However, these com
mittees were not connected with tho 
Thistle Board in any way but were 
appointed by tho Sales Manager from 
tho Junior class.
STUDENTS 
HEAR FOCH
Great War Leader and Staff 
Honored by Students at 
Carrieg ie Music 
Hall
CHURCH PRESIDES
Very unexpectedly last Thursday 
morning the opportunity caiue for 
the faculty and students of Tech to 
see and hear the great Marshal of 
France Tech was ready, on her 
toes, to crowd tho Music Hall to 
capacity. Mr. Charles HeinrotU 
played several selections during the 
few moments before tho arrival of 
.Marshal Foch. Seats on tho stage 
were occupied by the faculty and 
di rec tot's of Tech aud by the staif 
accompanyftig the Marshal.
As the Maishal entered all arose, 
and Mr. Hertz led in a skyrocket*1 
and an accenter for Foch. Mr. 
.Heinroth then offered ono of vtho 
Marshals favorite seleations; Piece 
ileroique by Caesar Franck, a 
French composer.
A short address by tho Marshal 
followed: As he spoke in French
his staff interpreter repeated his
message. Marshal Foch spoke as 
follows:
After all the horrors of war 1 
have seen, it is particularly gratify
ing for me to in this center of 
America aud of manufacture, art 
and science, to soo tlioso tilings
which we again have taken up in
I he interest of civilization. I con
gratulate you upon being presom 
among tho arts, and sciences while 
bringing forth tills royal march of 
culture/
I-Ils kindly voice, though not lit
erally understood by tho many, im
pressed all with Ills groatnoss.
It was an unusual occasion for
Carnogle to pay rospoct to, and bo 
honored by ono of tho groatest of 
all soldiers.
PITT-TECH SMOKER 
WELL ATTENDED
In uocordanco with tho plan out
lined In a lottor sent to all Pitt and 
Toch fratornltlos by XI Slgilia Upsllori, a smoker was hold at tho houso 
of tills fraternity at 5840 Bartlett 
street, oh Wodnosdiiy evening, Novombor 0. The smoker was attend
ed by representativos of Pitt and 
Toclh fratornltlos, as well as by 
Coach Steffen, "Buddy Ovorond, 
Frank Ilaaren, Bob Waddoll, Dr. 
Marks, Prot. Kidd and BUI Pfouts, 
several of whom gavo short talks.
At 10 o'clock tho meeting was 
called to order with Leo Sawders 
prosldlng. Ho explained that the 
smoker had been called as a moans 
of bringing about bettor relations 
botween tho two schools. The 
Speakers woro then Introduced. 
Coach Stoffon said that he could 
see no roason for such bad feeling 
botween the two schools when the 
students Intermingle socially. It 
was Ills opinion that such rowdy
ism as was shown at. tho last PittTech game was duo to a low olomont in school and cited) the Yale, 
Harvard, and Princeton games as ex
amples where rivalry was particu
larly keon but not rowdy. Stoffon 
ended liis talk with a tributo to the 
Pitt authorities and best wishes for 
the success of tho movement.
Professor Kidd1 drew a comparison 
between the smoker and the Disarm
ament Conference, and asked Pitt 
and Tech to disarm. He cited tho 
Carnegie-Frick Steel War as ono of 
the primitive causes for the rivalry. 
Buddy Overend gave a brief his
tory of the development of the PittTech rivalry. Ho said it should bo 
natural for Tech to support Pitt and 
Pitt to support Tech when either 
plays other teams.
Bob Waddell gave Warner and 
the Pitt team unlimited praise, and 
said that Tech was also reaching 
the top notch In athletics. Bob said 
that a Pitt-Tech game would event
ually come but that the proper spir
it must be fostered first. He urged 
that each man present exert influ
encein this regard within his own 
organization.

In tlio greatest homo gamo of the season, the Plaid machine triumphed 
ovor tho Bethany Btlffalos by the sheer brilliance of tliolr team play. Tho 
scQe, 21-12, very clearly shows what kind of an opposition tho Plaid was up 
against. The total of ono touchdown and three goals aftor touchdowns was 
tlio margin. For throe and ono-lialf quarters, tho game, while from a score 
standpoint, was Techs, was in reality anybody's gamo, lor Tech was lead
ing by the very narrowest of margins, two pointsone field goal would liavo 
altered tho advantage, or one touchdown would havo snatched the gamo
completely away from either ono. Un
der such a charm,, the spectators 
wore spell-bouud with oxcitement and 
expectation, for at any moment the 
unexpected might have happened 
and it did, too.
There are many who believe that 
had tho field been dry, the gamo 
would have beon Bethany's, but again 
there are those who think that it was 
only tho wot and heavy field that 
kept the Tech score as low as it was, 
for it must be admitted that with a 
dry field, tho faster and liglitor Toch 
backs might have brokon looso much 
of tenor, and for larger gains. But to 
suppose along that lino is only to 
SUPPOSE and nothing else, and sup
positions fail to make much headway. 
It Is only regrettable that such a 
gamo, important as it was to both 
Tech and Bethany, had to have tho 
fato of being played on such a Hold.
Bo that as it wa| tho issuo must bo 
mot. Carnegie Tech won the game. 
Bethany was outplayed at times, and 
again it was vlq'e versa. Bethany 
brought a groat team to Tech Field, 
and' It playod ontlroly up to expecta
tions, going down In dofoat by tlio 
margin of ono touchdown, just as pre
dicted. It was without a doubt tho 
greatest and best team, outsldo of 
tho Tartan machine, that has playod 
on Tocll Flold tills season. Toch admlros, and pays homoago to, and con
gratulates such a team, and Its coach.

In Randolph and Jean Bothany has 
a pair of backs who would bo a cred
it to any\teain. They are heavy, and 
despite tilut. fact show an uncanny 
ability to got a quick Htart, and onco 
started their weight works greatly to 
tliolr advantage, an uwowu Viy tlio fact ' 
that thoy made many long gains 
through tho Toch lino. This typo of 
play had quite a bit ol success, and 
was responsible for practically all of 
Bothmiys ground gaining. Their 
forward pass did not como up to ex
pectations! The gVeator number of 
them were grounded, and those that 
did succoed gained only a very short 
distance, and In many places, even 
lost ground.
Btowart, who threw the forwards 
for Dothany was good In this respect, 
but was hampered by the wot and 
slimy ball, and by the fact that the 
men were so covered with mud from 
head to foot as to be unrecognizable. 
With a dry ball to handle Htewart 
would have made (|ulte a bit of trou
ble for Tech, Bethanys lino was al
most Impregnable, as shown by the 
fact that very fow of Techs gains 
wore made through It. Tech had to 
depend on tho //\oot-footod Robertson, 
for most of tliolr gains. But In tho 
long , run, and (Inal computations, it 
will bd found that Tcch with her end 
runs wore much more effective than 
was Bothany with her heavy llnobucklng, and right thoro Is whore the

station to tho press box at the field, 
which Is a half mile away. This job 
was dono In record tlmo. Tho plays, 
as thoy woro mado were telephoned 
over this specially constructed lino. 
At the radio station, officially known 
as 8XE, they wero sent out by wire
less. Two stations In Pittsburgh then 
picked them up and re-transmitted tho 
story of tho game by radio telephone 
for tho benefit of tho public.
The annual oloctlon or tho offi
cers of the Night College of Engi
neering took place on Monday even
ing, November 7, at tho Carnogle 
Union, at 8:30 oclock.
President Hamerschlag addrossed 
the students on tho scientific devel
opments which had taken place re
cently. He congratulated the men 
for their unselfishness in depriving 
themselves ol many of the pleasures 
of life and the sacrifices which they 
were making in an endeavor to se
cure technical training; but in the 
great attempt to procure this educa
tion, tho students should not over
look the fact that it is highly essenial that they should outline a plan 
covering whatever spare time they 
may have for their physical and 
mental recreation.
Director Mott next spoke regarding 
the distinction between "Regular" 
and "Special students in the col
lege. It was brought out that those 
students who have met the entrance 
requirements were classified as 
Regulars, and at the same time were 
candidates for the diploma; while 
those who did not meet the entrance 
requirements were not eligible for 
the diploma and were consequently 
called Special students,
Dean Tarbell spoke on the sub
ject of tho Night Students Activi
ties Foe, stating that as yet tins 
question j)as not beon doflnltoly sottled, either ono way or thn other 
and I10 urged that when the question 
v/nu brought for action before the 
night students onco more that all 
should cast thoir voto, either affirm
atively or negatively, In order that 
tho question may be permanently 
settled.
Dr. Ihrlg told tho studonts that 
this year tho student registration In 
all of tho night classes had dropped 
to approximately 50 per cont of last 
year's figures and ho gave some of

THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE AND THE COLLEGE MAN
I-Iovcring above all things, the Washington ooni'creneo should 
demand the attention of every American, and more than anyone else 
the college man and. woman. Besides looking for technically trained 
men, the world places the moral responsibility oi! leadership upon the 
college mans shoulders. To him the world is looking for a leader 
and he must meet their expectations. He must have, not only the 
knowledge and information of his profession at his finger tips, but 
he must also know something of the affairs of the world; he must 
have a clear understanding of the Washington conference.
What is the real issue of the conference, limited armaments or 
Japans attitude towards the Open. Door policy in China? Shall 
the British swing with us or go to the Japanese side? The Washing
ton conference, will either un-make or hasten the impending war in 
the Pacific. The situation is extremely delicate; it is a world crisis. 
'Whether we have another war depends upon the outcome of the 
Washington confftence, not a war for future generations, but a war 
in which we, ourselves, will be participants.,
This should vitally interest every college man and woman and 
it behooves ail of us to follow the conference as closely as possible 
and learn all wc cun. ______________________________________

.the probable causes for tills drop
ping off. There can bo no doubt 
that tho dropping off of tlio student 
registration is moro than made up 
by the pop of those In attendance 
this year.
It was quite noticeablo by this 
time that tlio audience seemed to 
ho a bit iamlHhod hud to relieve 
^ frhelu. xolnUiU'ol! IJo thoughts of star
vation, a largo supply of apples and 
doughnut were produced; these 
made a hit..
Tho last, but not tho loast Important of tho evening's events, tho 
oiootion oi! tho officers l.o servo 
throughout tho your 1021-1922. The 
following were elected to hold office 
during tho your:

a rooont conversation ho expressed 
hlnuiolf that In bln opinion. It will 
bn just sh proper for tho statesmen 
of Mm various nations to got tor,other to (llsoilss ways and moans 
of preventing world-wide JobloMsnoUi, 
dad tho settlement of boundary dls 
putes him been for the Hlutesmon 
of tho times when jobs wore loss 
noctunary to a happy and contented 
body of oltlzGUa."
"Without some suoii world action, 
both for preventing joblessness and 
for easing off tho sharp corners of 
distrust and unhappiness betwoon 
tho nations, thero la., likely to bo 
ai:other world war before 1935. One 
moro war will deatroy civilization."
A Bolshoviat leader in tho mines 
where I worked laat year in South 
Wales, disagreed with me on this, 
lie said:
 'No. One more war will not de
stroy civilization, but it will destroy 
capitalists, the present system of 
society. So all we Bolshevists ne8d 
to do is to wait until the nations got 
to lighting again, and then wo will 
go In and gather up the pieces with
out the firing of a shot."
Mr. Williams was received with 
keen interest by the students. His 
talk did much to emphasize the im
portance of the present Conference 
for Limitation of Armaments and its 
timeliness.
Next, Mr. H. W. Dunlap of the 
Pittsburgh. Chapter of the American 
Red Cross, spoke of the coming 
membership camflialn. IIo explain
ed that the Rod Cross is operated 
under a chartor from Congress, and 
that Its purpose is not only to pro
vide relief hi wartime, but to servo 
in times of local disasters, and Is 
now caring for thousands of injured 
veterans of tho late war who are 
under Its care in hospitals bore and 
elsewhere. Not only Is tho subscrip
tion fee badly needed, but also a 
better and moro sympathetic under'standing of the Rod; Cross and its 
work to bo hoped for.
Steffen Receives Gift.
As a pleasant surprise) our old
standby of tho ,gridiron, Wally*
Steffen, football coach, was present
ed with a beautiful and complete
chest of*, silver by Frank Haarou, 
graduate manager, on behalf of the 
student body of Tech. "Wally"
Was almost too pleased to spealc. but 
expressed his gratitude for tills dem 
onstration of appreciation by tho 
students; and then he continued in 
reviewing'our game with State and 
in giving pointers on the Bethany 
game.
Credit is due to Assistant Coach 
Waddell for tho spectacular double 
pass that scored at Stato, ho said 
It was Waddell's idea, and ho who 
induced the squad to try it.
Colonel Brooks announced that 
Mr. Evorlmrdt of Arts, was: tho win
ner of the fall tennis tournament. 
Ho then presented; Mr. Evorlmrdt 
with a silver loving cup, Four very 
good now men for tho tennis quad 
wore discovered during tlio tourna
ment, and those in addition to tho 
old squad, iihould make a winning 
aggregation noxt spring.
Mimical numbers included a lively 
march by tho band at tho opening 
/6f the assembly, and a concert by 
tho Stringers and the Mandolin 
Club at the eloso. The latter had 
an added feature in tho appearance 
of "Alabam" in ills most clovor 
dark face comedy presentation of 
popular songii.
The groat variety of Important and 
lnferentlng ovonts which occurred 
ni this assembly made it a most 
momoruihlo tune, in tho opinion o 
many of the older studonts, it was 
tho greatest aeriemlbly over hold at

Happenings on the Campus
DR. RAYMOND CALKINS
VI8ITS MARGARET MORRISON
Last Wednesday afternoon tho Y. 
W. C. A. had the opportunity to listen 
to a great student leader, Dr. Ray
mond Calkins of Cambridge. Massa
chusetts. Dr. Calkins was in Pitts
burgh. In connection with religious 
week at tho University of Pittsburgh. 
Ho oponed his talk by telling us that 
there was one thing that, ho had put 
his foot down uponand that was his 
determination to come to see the girls 
of Carnegie Tech no matter what
ever else he did.
Dr. CalkinB was at Eaglesmere last 
Juno and was a great favorite amdhg 
the delegates there. Ho talked to us 
last Wednesday on the question of 
prayer. Ho talked as friend to friend 
and said the only way in wihiich. ho 
had any advantage over us was that 
ho had lived longer and that what 
he was today was tho result of his 
longer experience. I-Ie then adviaed 
us of tho importance of making our 
daily prayers, for only in that way 
could wo treat God as personal and 
not as someone out of our under
standing. We can pray for anything 
that is in our hearts and know there 
will be underatanding always. In
stead of praying for things to come 
in the way wo want, we should pray 
that wo will come to do things in 
His way.
Evory one present was very much 
Impressed by his talk and after tlio 
mooting Dr. Calkins said ho had 
never tallcod to a moro attentive 
group, tho highest compliment ho 
could possibly havo given us.
SENIOR PICTURES

COSMOPOLITAN CLUB

members of the club,aro all expected

THE ARTS LIBRARY
The Library or Arts la really one 
of the attractive features at Tech. 
Few people realize the exceptionally 
lino collection of works on line art 
which are to be found on the 
shelves there. A branch of the C. I. 
T. hut library, it contains a special 
collection on architecture, painting 
decoration, illustration, costume and 
the theater. There being about 3,000 
bound volumes, 6,000 bound and 
mounted photographs, 15,000 mounted 
plates of various kinds and about 
6,000 post dirds.
It is ujp to tho art student ' to 
 browse over this collection to his 
hearts conten tmerely taking care 
of the books and respecting the 
rights of others to study quietly. 
Since the collection is a reference 
one, no material can be taken from 
the library except with special per
mission.
Many students, even accustomed 
users, do not realize the resources 
of the collection. The plate and 
scrap book collections are not pecu
liar to a few, but every student can 
benefit by knowing how to use them. 
Tho mounted material is excellent 
and the following is the most im
portant:
1Architecture and decoration, 
showing styles and principal edifices 
of all iporiods,
2Illustration  Good representa
tions of objects which tho illustrator 
constantly nooda In tills workchil
dren, animals, plants, treos, birds, 
fishes, poster works, color studies, 
ships, stroot scenes, studies of alti
tudes and texture,- practically ovorything ono is likely to need. This 
collection is being enlarged and im-i 
proved Constantly.
3CostumesPlates showing his
toric costumes of tho various periods, 
fancy and bizarre costumes, uniforms, 
theatrical, Shakespearean, etc.
The assistant In charge is always 
glad to help in every way.
In the hut library, just across the 
street, there are to be found nil sorts 
of books on literature, history, man
ners, costumes,' drama and -fiction. 
This C. I. T. hut library is Intended 
for all students of Tech.
On Friday at 5 p. m., the Junior.! 
and Senior of the Architectural De
partment started to work on the 
Warren prize. The Warren prize Is 
the gift of Messrs. Whitney Warren 
and Lloyd Warren, offered for ex
cellence In planning a group of 
buildings. This prize is given each 
year to the two beet solutions sub
mitted for the competition. The 
first prize is $50.00, and the second 
$25.00. The problem this year is 
"A Hotel Establishment," consisting 
of a hotel proper, 40 cottages, 
swimming pool, tennis courts and 
power plant. The problem ,was due 
Monday. November 14, at 10 a. m,
 Tho Juniors aro working on "A 
Golf iCluib" which is due Novem
ber 26.
RADIO CLUB MEETING
The Radio Club of Carnegie Tech 
hold its regular meeting Monday, 
October 7, in the Tower Radio 
Room. The attendance was not as 
good as at former meetings, which 
was probably due to the fact that 
many of tho men were tired from 
the Penn State trip. We hope tha. 
the next meeting will be better at 
tended.
After the reading of the minutes 
of the previous meeting, the busi
ness was rapidly transacted. Re
port was made on the Student 
Councils decision on the obtaining 
of the Union for the dance, and i. 
was decided to postpone the dance 
till after tho Christmas holidays, 
thereby obtaining more time in 
which to work out several novel 
features for the same.
Committee was appointed to take 
care of the ordering and buying of 
the materials for the radio sets, and 
actual work to be tailed tonight m 
the tower at 7:30, and members 
who have time and wish to help are 
invited to come.
The secretary was instructed to 
obtain quotations on club pins, from 
several of the manufacturers. The 
proposed pin is of rather novel de
sign, and will mean something to 
the members, both as an emblem of 
"Tech" and Radio.
The business being cleared, the 
speaker of the evening, Dr. O. T. 
Cruiksliank was introduced. Dr. 
Cruikshank gave an interesting talk 
on radio topics in general. Among 
the subjects was the description of 
satiesfactory indoor aerials, the com
ing of a new two element vacuum 
tube, which was discovered by a 
German scientist, Dr. Julius E. 
Lilienfeld, of the Leipzig University.
This new tube will have no fila
ment, but will contain only a plate 
aud another pointed electrode, the 
vacuum of the tube to be very high, 
and by use of a potentialof lesa 
than a hundred volts the tube will 
function as a detector of radio sig
nals.
The next Radio Club meeting is to 
be held Wednesday, November 30 
in the Tower Radio Room, and all 
men interested in the clubs work 
are invited! to attend the meting.

"THE THUNDERBOLT CRITICISM THE SCIENCE PLEBES BANQUET
Though tho play is somewhat oldfashioned in characterization, as well 
as in plot development, we thoroughly 
enjoyed the performance on Thurs
day evening, and offer the following 
criticism:
The direction oil tliie whole was 
splendid. The old school was, of 
course, obvious, and we are certain 
that a little moro suppression and 
restraint might have added greatly 
to tho effectiveness of some scenes. 
The continued shouting by several 
members of the Cast was somewhat 
annoying, especially in a play of this 
nature, where the emotion if unre
strained Is apt to run away with the 
character. At times the grouping 
was clumsy and unbalanced, but aa a 
whole tho complicated movements 
and business showed a great deal of 
clovemoss in direction.
Mr. Willard was at his best as 
ThaddOus Mortlmoro, and wo feel that 
tlila la tho moat finished work that 
till young man lias done. Wc might 
suggost. that he watch his walking 
and try to improve it, as n singularly 
comic strldo tondp to lessen greatly 
tho offoctlvonoas of his soiious mo
menta.
.Tames Mortlmoro, as playod by Mr. 
iSchaughoncy, was at times convinc
ing. Some of his work in tho lust iict, 
and li/Is final exit, was dono with 
groat aliicoiity. His continued shout
ing and hi bad diction detract a groat 
deal from his chnractorizatlon, but. Ills 
work shows Improvomont over what 
he has provlously dono.
Mr. Paquins Colonel Ponting was 
splendid. Always in character, always 
pleasing uml amusing without a hint 
of overplaying.
Mr. Caldwell, as the second brother, 
Stephen, had the same tendencies as 
Mr. Schaughoncy  his shouting 
marred his diction. His long drawn 
out All!" in tho third act was a par
ticularly jarring note in a good char
acterization.
A word should be said for Mr. Hoag. 
This young man has always shown a 
keen perception of his work and an 
earnestness which always makes 
whatever he does worth while. His 
big scene in the third act would have 
been more convincing had he shown 
less hurry and more weight and au
thority. Otherwise, he did exception
ally well.
Miss Osborne and Miss Ziele were 
both splendid. Their characteriza
tions were smooth and unbroken and 
secured the entire sympathy of the 
audience. Miss Osbornes appearance 
was altogether charming, but Miss 
Ziele often spoiled her effect by too 
violent arid too open weeping. She 
does not cry well, and on that account 
some of her scenes became unreal 
and a little tiresome.
The wivesLouisa, Rose and Ann 
are badly drawn, and. were played by 
the Misses Lowe, Hannon and Nortlidurft in a rather colorless manner. 
Miss Lowe overacted at times, and 
subcoeded in making her part a bur
lesque. Her peculiar, trick of too 
throaty diction hinders her to a great 
oxt.ent. MIsS Harmon lookod lovely, 
and yet abaolutoly in character, which 
sooms rather odd, but is true. Her 
hysterical laughs woro bad  not so 
much on account of poor acting, but 
of tliolr unfortunate placing. Miss 
Nortlulurft was sincere in hor bit. 
Miess Ripley as Joyce, tho little girl, 
was wholly childish and lovablo.
Tho play afforded a very pleasant 
evening's entertainment.
Respectfully,
"THREE, PATRONS."
Dear Dad: 
Well, we had our banquet. Some 
banquet, too, Dad! rIhe fun began 
Tuesday morning when some of the 
Sophs succeeded in capturing H. N. 
Smith, the chairman of the commit
tee. After this they developed a 
great love for. section leaders and 
succeeded in kidnapping practically 
all of them.
They had a merry time trying to 
discover where . the banquet waB to 
be, but nobody knew. Many Plebe 
rescue parties were formed to free 
the unlucky section leaders but none 
were successful. In fact, one of the 
parties was taken in and all kept 
"pantsless" in one of the dorms. 
Even this did not prevent some 
from escaping, who passed for cross
country men on the campus.
About six o-clock the Sophs de
ckled that their captives knew noth
ing about the banquet and so their 
pants were returned and they were 
released. Everyone headed for the 
banquet or a route by which they 
would eventually arrive there. First 
we found it necessary to shake some 
of the Soph "Bhadowera" after 
which wo found ourBelves at the 
Fort Wayne station. Whore bound? 
No 0110 knew, until finally we all 
Started through the gutes and tlion 
we woro auro of a ride. Wo trav 
eled to tho wilds of Sewickly, Fa., 
many procautions being taken to aee 
that there were no disguised Sophs 
on the train.
Banquet at Elmhurst Inn.
At Sewickly we marched (yea! 
we were orderly) tothe notedElm
hurst Inn aud scattered, ourselves 
at the numerous tables. Then the 
question arose. Would Moessner, 
cur president, be here. Suddenly 
everyone began yelling and cheering. 
Ah! Moessner! What more could 
we wish! The class intact! Moess
ner made a short speech after which 
we all proceeded to dig in.
Music by the Plebe orchestra and 
singing and entertainment by the 
two noted performers, Thelka Neely 
and Billie Kines.
Sophs Offer Congratulations.
During the progress of the ban
quet who should walk in but eight 
or ten Sophs. We were doubtful as 
what was about to happen but Han
na, their president, congratulated us 
on our banquet and, after we had 
heartily cheered the classes of 24 
and 25, withdrew.
The first after dinner speaker 
was Dean Mott, who gave us some 
very good advice about our reading. 
He was followed by Dean Tarbell, 
who gave a very interesting talk on 
activities and sand, enumerating the 
various periods in the life of a 
Plebe wheu sand is needed. Al 
May told some of liis experiences as 
a Freshman and of his work with 
various other schools during the 
past. year. The success of tire ban
quet is duo to Al May, as well as 
Jack Evans, who gave. us soijie 
sound advice concerning Tech an-1 
tho Tech Clan.
Upon returning to Pittsburgh 
we indulged in a snako dance am 
minor festivities. Everyone agreed 
that they had experienced the best 
time of their lives and, after sever 
al school yells delivered in front of 
tho dorms tho party brolco up.
Woll, Dad, I guess thats about 
all for tho banquet. It sure was 
some banquet.
Yours,
A PLEBE.

FINAL GAME 
SATURDAY
Strong Maryland Eleven to 
Face Plaid Machine in 
Last Football Game 
of Season
Carnegie Tech will close her 1921 
football season this coming Satur
day with the University of Mary
land grldders. In briuging tho 
Marylanders to Teoh Field Gradu
ate Manager Haaren will bring an 
entirely new opponent in a team 
that has never before performed be
fore the Pittsburgh football bugs. 
Furthermore, it is 'believed that a 
master-stroke in tho scheduling of 
Techs opponents has been made, for 
it denotes the starting of a new 
policy in the Plaid football world 
Heretofore it has been the policy of 
Tech to play more in this district 
rather than go outside of the Wostcrn Pennsylvania territory. It fur
ther indicates that Tech is starting 
to step out and add stronger anti 
stronger teams to their playing 
schedule, which cannot help but 
work to their advantage, for it must 
be admitted that a teiim must play 
good) teams in order to develop it
self to a point where it can success
fully cope Avitli the best.
Maryland Had Hard Schedule.
Last season the University of 
Maryland had one of the strbngest 
teams in tho East. This year, they 
have been meeting many reverses, 
but this cannot be traced to the fat; 
that they have a poor team, but 
to tho fact that thoy have taken on 
teams that have always stood Jn 
the limelight of the football worlU. 
The general average of teams aa 
played by the Marylanders is much 
higher than those iplayed by Carne
gie Tech, that is to say with tho 
exception of Techs games with 
Penn State, Washington and Jeffer
son and Botluiny. Maryland, in play
ing through a schedule including 
Yale, University of North Carolina, 
Virginia Polytech, St. Johns and 
Syracuse has surely playod through 
a much harder scliodule than has 
Tech when such teams as Thiol, 
Westminister, Alleghony, St. Bonaventure and Goneva wore played.
When it is considered that Mary
land has Bucceodod in winning only 
ono of these above-named gamos, 
the Plaid adherents aro likely to 
got it into their heads that tlio gam< 
will bo a soft proposition. But this 
column would like to warn tlio av
erage football enthusiasts around 
Tech and Pittsburgh not to tako too 
much for granted. It is a generally 
/admitted fact up in tho North that 
tho Southern footiball teams aro 
much inferior to tho Northorn foams. 
As a result tho average football 
coach or a Northern college is like
ly to underestimate his Soulhorn 
opponent. For Toch to make that 
mistake at tho present time would 
very likely play havoc with their 
good record as mado . tills soaaon.
This column further would 111(0 
to emphasize tho fact that Southern 
teams are far above what tho North 
ernor imagines, whlcfli can be taken 
to insinuate that a Southorn team 
is most likely to come up North and 
pul. a serious crimp into uif other
wise successful campaign. For in
stance, note should bo mado of the 
Cl eorgia-4-Iarvard, Centor-IIarvard, or 
Tennossee-Dartmouth games.
Style of Play Not Scouted1.
Nothing whatever is known of the 
type of game as will be employed 
against the Tech team, but it is 
known that Maryland includes on 
her roster men who are good at 
brokenrfield running, as well as men 
who can hit the line hard. Her line 
will out-weigh the Tech line by 
about five pounds to the man, which 
will be a big handicap to overcome, 
but in the past this has been suc
cessfully done, as witness Bethany. 
In Captain Untz Brewer, Maryland 
lias perhaps one of the best punters 
in the country, a man who has not 
failed once to outpunt his opposing 
punter during the past two seasons. 
This same man is very dangerous 
in drop-kicking as evidenced by tho 
fact that he won the game from Vir
ginia Polytech by kicking three field 
goals. As a Baltimore paper com
ments, Brewer is "a good brokenfield runner, whose dodging ability 
has few equals in the South."
Another item of interest gleaned 
from reading the Baltimore Sun was 
the fact that Semley is good on 
hurling forward passes. Therefore 
it would do Tech good to spend 
some time on breaking this game up. 
While they are already fairly good 
in. this respect, an especially good 
team at this type of play might get 
away. It was further noticed that 
while they are themselves good in 
the forward passing game, they aro 
not especially good In t^eaklng-up 
such a gamo when resorted to by 
their opponants.
The educated toe is something 
that Toch has not beon compelled 
to run 111 against ho far this sc'a 
son, and exactly this is ono of the 
parts of Maryland anatomy. Tho 
educated toe of Captain Untz Brew
er has succeeded four times this 
season, against ho opponents listed 
above. This does not tell how many 
times it has been successful against 
weaker opposition.
TOUGH SCHEDULE
FOR RIFLE TEAM
Tho rtflo team will havo about the 
hardest schedule of any team in 
tho country Tor tlio coming season. 
Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Colgate 
and M. I. T. have already beon 
scheduled while matches with Penn, 
Cornell, Syracuse, Illinois, Boston 
College, Georgetown and Columbia 
are still ponding. These teams will 
probably all bo placed ou the Tech 
schedule in tho near future.
The three hardest matches will 
be with Yale, Princeton and Harv
ard. They aro the Big Three in 
ritle as In football. In regard to 
Tech it may bo said that we are 
particularly fortunato in having sev
en of last years men in school and 
with tho abundance of new material 
there is no reason why Tech will 
not have one of tho best teams in 
the country.
Team practice has been started 
while tho club has been preparing 
for tlie> school championship compe
tition which began on November 1*1. 
Each competitor will turn in two 
official targets a week for a period 
of three weeks. At the end of that 
time two gold and two silver med
als will be awarded. Ono of each 
for two positions, standing and 
prone. All club members who wore 
not on last year's team are eligible 
for the competition.
. The range is open for practice on 
Tuieisdays, Thursdays and Fridays 
from *1:30 to 6:00 p. m. Saturday 
morning is reserved for tlio team. 
Menibersliip' cards can be obtained 
at tho range during any practice 
period. Tho range is located on 
the fourth floor of tho Arts Building 
over the P. & I. Department

THE PENALTY OF EFFICIENCY

POOR LECTURERS
Join the Y and liclp serve 
Tech.
About this period of tho sosslon, 
ovory year, eomos a sorios of com
plaints from studonts about profess
ors -and lecturers who insist on 
sponding more than the time allotted 
to thorn each day hi discussing thoir 
subjects. Many of them will con
tinue speaking far after the boll has 
rung for the conclusion of their lec
ture, and, as a consequence, tlio fol
lowing lecturer has necessarily to 
curtail his subject in order to keep 
within the time allotted to him.
If the lectures were particularly in
teresting the students might not no
tice the fact that tho time was pass
ing, but it is a notable fact that the 
poorest and most uninteresting lec
turers are those who are unable to 
finish their subjefct within the time 
allowed to them.
Students are being continually told 
to arrange their work in a schedule 
so that a certain amount of time will 
be given to each part of their work. 
It is rather difficult for them to follow 
the advice given to them when the 
lecturers themselves have no trace 
of system in the way they conduct 
their coursesMcGill Daily.
INTELLIGENT DRESSING
How a college girl may be comfort
ably, suitably and economically
clothed for all occasions, was ade
quately discussed by Mrs. Chester 
B. SLory, in the Assembly held in 
the Little Theater. Mrs. Story 
is the dress economist for the
Joseph Horne Company, and as
such, was heard wlLli deep interest, 
After Mrs. Story was introduced by 
Mrs. Scales during which time the 
boys warts requested to leave, Mrs. 
Story regretted their departure. She 
said she had hoped for an opportun
ity Lo beg them not to wear red 
ties with green socks and purple 
striped suits, and a few other such 
pleasing combinations. However, her 
attention boJag entirely given over to 
the consideration of clothes for the 
girls, several very good-looking 
dresses were shown. Tho over pop
ular Peter Pan was shown In both 
Mohawk and Beige. A convertible 
jersey suit, sweater and skirt, and a 
canton crepe model were repreeentatlve. The hints as to the various 
points to be considered in clioowing 
a wardrobe were timely and were 
thankfully received.

TARTANS TRIM STRONG
BETHANY BUFFALOS
(Continued From Page One.) 
gaining through tho lino, Shoemaker 
punted for Bethany, and right hero, 
tho Plaid started to "put a Plaid 
blanket over the Buffalos" by march
ing straight down tho Held until nine 
yards separated them from tho Beth
any goal lino. Here with just ono 
yard to go for first down, a bit of 
poor judgment lost the ball. Instead 
of trying to buck the ball over for 
that remaining one yard, a forward 
across the goal line was attempted. 
Bethany immediately punted out of 
danger  seemingly  to Robertson, 
who was downed In Ills tracks. But, 
hardly stopping, not oven to clear the 
players eyes of "Toch Field, the 
Plaid bogan its second march to its 
first touchdown. This time with suc
cess attending its efforts. Robertson 
with Ills end runs preceded by perfect 
interference, and aided by tho linobucking of Mills, brought tho ball 
right under the very shadow of Beth
anys goal lino. Mills tlion carried it 
ovor tho remaining ono yard. Com
fort, as usual, klckod goal.
About this time Bothany throw the 
"Plaid blanket" off, and procoodod to 
nialco tho spectators wonder just how 
bad thoy woro going to cloan up Toch. 
Thoir llno-buclclng backs Homod to hit 
tho lino with an irresistible force bo 
often that boforo Toch know what 
had happened, found thomsolvos trail
ing Bothany by ono whole touchdown, 
and tho Buffalo now soomlngly mad, 
mad, mad. Randolph scorod both of 
Bethanys touchdowns, while Shoomaker inlssod both goals afterwards.
Robortson Makes 36-Ynrd Run.
After the above damago had boon 
done, tho Tartan hordo seomod to 
again roull/.o that thoy woro up 
against a roal foe, and forthwith pro* 
coodod to get busy and even up tho 
count, and for good measure kick tho 
goal afterward. Robertson wan again 
tho chief onomy of Bothany, for ho, 
In making Tooli's second touchdown, 
raood around Bethanys right ond for 
86 yards, one of tho prottlQBt runs of 
the gamo.
Aftor this nothing olso happonod to 
make the score otherwise until late 
In the gamo, when under tho cover 
of darkness and porfoct Intorforoneo 
Eddlo Low Is broke loose and galloped 
around Bethanys left ond for a 22- 
yard gain aud touchdown, This foal: 
speaks highly for Lewiss ability as a. 
football player, for prior to this no 
Toch man had boon able to ovou so 
much as closely approach the Both
any goal lino since Robertson's spec
tacular 40-yard run towards tho end 
of tho second quarter. This Is Lew
iss first year at Tech, and ho will no 
doubt develop Into one of Tooli's most, 
dopondablo and Imrdost working foot
ball mon ore next season has ad
vanced any dlstanco whatovor. Carnoglo Toch was lucky to be able to 
offor tho courso Lewis desired, for 
many southorn colleges were vielng 
for Ills services, among them woro 
Georgia Toch, tho University of Ala
bama, Alabama Polytech and tho Uni
versity of tho South.
Just prior to this last touchdown 
for Tech, with the score standing at 
14-12, the Plaid adherents in the 
stands were thrown Into a near panic 
by the final and desperate effort of 
Bothany to escape defeat. Bethany 
suddenly, like the drowning man 
grasping towards a mere straw, 
launched a forward passing atttack. 
The darkness was intense, and the 
fear that a Bethany man would under 
cover of darkness manage to escape 
with the ball unseen and race over 
the Tech goal line made the final epi
sode of the gamo intensely interest
ing. The spectators could not see 
where the pail was, but were never
theless thankful that the Tech play
ers could. Bethany alternated her 
forward passing game with attempts 
to bewilder the Plaid by having sev
eral men rush away from the playing 
center doubled up as if they had the 
ball, hoping thereby the man who did 
have the ball would escape detection 
long enough for him to race across 
the Tech goal line, some eight yards
away and thereby snatch the game 
away from Tech. But Bethany did 
reckon with the cat-like watchfulness 
of tho Plaid, for every such attempt 
was smeared oven in the making, tho 
ball Anally going over to Toch, when 
tho break came, and Lewis scored his 
touchdown, thus giving the game 
without disputo to Tech.
All In all it was a brilliant gamo, 
full of Interest aud oxoitement, and 
ono that Tech fully deserved to win, 
and one that was hard for Bothany 
to place iu her lost column.

The Reserves were defeated Satur
day by the Slippery Rock Normal 
school at Slippery Rock, Pa.
The field was a sea of mud and the 
heavy. Normal school team got two 
touchdowns in the first half, before 
the Skibos had started to play their 
best football. As usual the Reserves 
Vallied in the second half and put on 
a real exhibition of football, but were 
unable to force the ball over the Normalites goal line.
The tackling, which has been a 
weak point right along showed the 
greatest improvement of the season. 
Saturday. Several forward passes 
were completed for large gains. 
Smith, right half, starred for Tech

ART CLASS IN MAINE
Prof. C. J. Taylor of the College of 
Fine Arts, fourteen students, several 
large boxes of paintings, posters, pen 
and ink drawings, sketches and one 
tattered Carnegie Tech flag returned 
safety to Pittsburgh after a ten and a 
half weeks cruise in and about Boothbay Harbor, Maine.
They left Pittsburgh June 28 with 
stop-overs in New York, Boston and 
Portland, Me. The stops were full of 
adventure and wonderful sight-seeing. 
In New York the Metropolitan Mu
seum of Art and the Woolwortli Tower 
were the favorites. In Boston numer
ous historical places were visited and 
Harvard explored. A very busy day 
was spent in the Capital of the Bay 
State. Longfellow's home and other 
points of interest were visited in 
Portland. The last lap of the trip 
was passed uneventfully, and the par
ty landed in Boothbay Harbor on June 
30th.
The mornings work was indoors, 
consisting of poster work, illustrations 
and commercial art; the afternoons 
were given to landscape painting, pen 
and ink work and landscape drawing 
in pencil. Everything was not work 
as lots of play was mixed with it, and 
a happy medium established. Some 
became very adept at late afternoon 
fishing when the tide suited, and a 
large supper haul of cunners was the 
result. There was canoeing, boat 
trips down the rivers to the sea, and 
even a baseball team was * formed, 
which although defeated by the local 
team, made a creditable showing.
Editor of The Tartan:
Dear Sir:
I agree entirely with what Bill 
Says regarding the cheers and 
have only one remark to make. 
When we of 14 were at Carnegie 
we cheered with a "rah. It has 
only been during the last five or six 
years that the weaker word, "ray 
has been instituted. If you stick 
to traditions you will use the snap
pier form of yell with a "rah.
My heart is with the team at 
State today, and I believe that our 
best team in history will come out 
on top. If they dont I am sure 
that the Tech rooters will show good 
spirit at all times.
About two weeks ago I had the 
opportunity to attend a game in the 
southern part of this state between 
the home team and _ a team from 
Ohio. There was a crowd of 45,000 
of which about 8,000 were Ohio sym
pathizers. The Ohio team showed 
the home team how to play and 
those 8,000 rooters "out rooted the 
home crowd. While it was a fine 
example of cheering by the winning 
side, the home crowd did not be
gin to rise to the occasion and 
cheer their team on. As a result 
the gloomy feeling seemed to spread 
tc the players and the game was 
lost.

Oliver B. Shallenberger
I
T, IS ONE THIN^r to produce n new idea 
that is simply of theoretical interest. It is 
another to make the new idea into a commer
cial success.
This is the story of Oliver B. Shallenberger, 
and how in 1888 lie discovered the principle 
that led him to invent the watt-hour meter, 
the familiar little device that makes practica
ble the commercial distribution of alternating 
current, which means 95% of all the elec
tricity that is distributed.
Shallenberger, who resigned a Naval com
mission, to take up his work with Westinghouse, made his discovery while experiment
ing, with a newly devised alternating current 
arc lamp. His attention was attracted bj^ the 
behavior of a small spring which had fallen 
upon the main magnet of the lamp, into such 
a position that the forces proceeding from 
both the magnet coil and the extended soft 
iron core affected it. And the simple little 
thing that he noticed was merely that the 
spring was slowly rotating! But to the in
telligently curious observer, that was enough.
Further experiments having satisfied him 
that the action was caused by alternating
electric currents, he set to work, encouraged 
by his knowledge of Westingliouse policies, to 
make practical the newly found principle. 
Three weeks of almost uninterrupted toil, and 
lie had produced the first practical alternating 
current meter of the induction typethe uni
versal type of the present time.
Thus for the first time the measurement of 
the quantity of alternating current passing 
through a line was made commercially practi
cable and its distribution became possible 
from an economic as well as an engineering 
point of view. In fact, the whole structure o 
our great power systems depends upon the 
accurate measurement, by millions of such 
meters, of the electricity used in the homes and 
industries of the nation. So well was Shallenbergers work done, and so complete was his 
conception of the possibilities of his discovery, 
thatfor more than thirty years his fundamental 
idea has been in use in many and various forms.
The encouragement which Westinghouse 
has always given to new ideas, and the judg
ment with which they have been evaluated, 
are nowhere better exemplified than in this 
story of the alternating current meter.

April 3Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie vis
ited the school, going to each of the 
four schools. Mr. Carnegie was very 
well pleased with work of the school, 
and showed considerable interest in 
the new athletic field.
April 4Monday, Mr. and Mrs. 
Cai-negie visit Tech.
Perhaps the greatest event in the 
history of Techs five years of 
growth was the occasion of Mr. and 
Mrs. Carnegies visit to the schools. 
The party arrived Monday morning, 
and was met by Director Hamersclilag. Dean Connelly escorted 
them through the Apprentice and 
Journeymens Building, Mr. Carnegie 
expressing keen interest in Mr 
Doseys Foundry and Mr. Taylors 
Forge Shop. Mr. Carnegie had a 
hearty handshake With the Scotch
man, Mr. Whyte, in charge of the 
tool room in the machine hop. 
From there he went to the Pattern 
Shop, and had quite a chat with Mr. 
Pfouts. Mrs. Carnegie was very 
much interested in tho mottoes and 
terse sentences pinned to the bulle
tin board in the Pattern Shop.
Dean Goodwin then took them to 
the part of the building occupied by 
the School of Applied Design, wlieio 
Mr. Carnegie gave a short informal 
talk. Ho sold to the students: I 
am sure you will be famous, for 
you come from a famous school. 
The party then left for an Inspec
tion of the aeroplane being con
structed by the Aero Club.
Ho viewed the Athletic Field, 
where Mr. Conway explained the 
sacrifice that the students' made to 
secure the field. This impressed 
Mr. Carnegie very much, and he 
commented on the need for bodily 
development along with mental de
velopment. The gymnasium in the 
M. M. C. S was an object of inter
est. He gave a talk to the girls, 
emphasizing the necessity for them 
to dress in a plain and permanent
The new gym is to be a part of the 
alumni and student bodies. The trus
tees have authorized an Alumni Fed

This has been done because the trus
tees feel that the alumni and students 
as a part of the school, have a deep

gymnasium and should have a me
dium through which to make sugges

project. Any ideas wlilcli the stu
