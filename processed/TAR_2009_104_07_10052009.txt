I On Sept. 26, several Carn
egie Mellon students, along with 
other Pittsburgh community 
members, were arrested by Pitts
burgh police and charged with 
disturbing the peace.
Junior art major Casey Li 
Brander was walking across the 
lawn of the Cathedral of Learn
ing when riot police came onto 
the scene. She stated in an email that the police used smoke 
bombs and pepper spray on the
crowds on the lawn.
According to Brander, she was 
not aware of any organized pro
tests happening at the Cathedral 
of Learning, and was crossing 
the lawn to get from Fifth Av
enue to Forbes Avenue. v
According to another Carnegie 
Mellon student, who wished not 
to be identified due to his pend
ing trial, there was an organized 
protest occurring downtown at 
the Allegheny County Jail.
He said that he was downSee ARRESTS, page A3
The changes that have been 
made to dining services at Car
negie Mellon have been obvious 
to anyone who has a meal plan, 
but recently, it has been revealed 
that there might be some things 
about the new company that stu
dents cant see.
A flyer was circulating the 
campus last week that suggested 
CulinArt is treating its employ
ees unfairly. The flyer states that 
workers are accusing CulinArt of 
eliminating their salary contri
butions to their health care and 
pension plans and that CulinArt 
is refusing to honor worker se
niority.
The flyer also stated that Culin
Art is proposing more contract 
changes that would be detrimen
tal to employees. These changes 
include no first year wage in
creases, a dramatic increase in 
health care costs, and elimina
tion of longand short-term dis
ability coverage and benefits.
CulinArt management was ei
ther unable or unwilling to com
ment on these accusations when 
questioned by The Tartan.
CulinArt workers refused to 
comment on their feelings about 
the situation. Many said they 
were worried that their jobs 
would be threatened if they pub
licly gave their opinion.
The director of Housing and 
Dining Services, Kim Abel, was 
limited in what she could discuss,

interaction is valuable to their dining experience.
although the proceedings and ne
gotiations between CulinArt and 
its employees are continuing. 
She was able to comment on who 
these negotiations are affecting, 
however: CulinArt employs
both union and non-union staff. 
They are currently in negotiation 
with the union staff. Union ne
gotiations are confidential, and 
therefore, CulinArt is not able to 
provide information about any 
concerns being addressed during 
the negotiations.
Abel added, Housing and Din
ing Services has explained the 
negotiation process as students 
or staff have asked. We also con
tinue to support the negotiating 
that is occurring between union
employees and CulinArt.
At this point, the campus com
munity cannot be made aware of 
what is happening in these nego
tiations, but a concern for many 
students is that they are going 
to lose some of the food workers 
that they have built relationships 
with.
Senior directing major Tina 
Robinson said, I hate to think 
that we could lose some of the 
workers. Ive been here for a full 
three years, and the best part of 
getting a meal [is] the interaction 
that I get to have with the work
ers. They are more than workers. 
They have become my friends. I 
want to help them fight against 
this injustice.
Abel said that student opinion 
matters in all areas of Housing 
and Dining Services, but given 
the confidential nature of the la
bor negotiations, it would be dif
ficult for a student to generate an 
informed opinion.
However, the workers are call
ing for student support during 
this negotiation process. There 
will be a meeting for students 
who want to get involved. The 
date and location of this meet
ing have yet to be announced. 
They have also asked students 
to call (412) 471-0690 or to email rgray@seiu32bj.org and 
leave a message with their name 
and contact information to show 
their support for the workers.

Carnegie Mellon 
has recently wel
comed computa
tional biology as an 
official department 
in the School of 
Computer Science. 
Along with this newr 
expansion and fu
ture possibility comes 
a unique prestige, as the 
Lane Center for Computa
tional Biology is the first 
computational biology de
partment in the country to 
be part of a computer 
science school.
Carnegie Mellon has strong tra
ditions of interdisciplinary research 
and of pioneering new fields, such 
as computational biology, [which] 
occur at the intersections of those 
disciplines, said Randal Bryant, 
dean of the School of Computer Sci
ence, in an interview for the School 
of Computer Science website.
Daryl Yeo, a sophomore computer 
science major, also spoke highly of 
the addition to the university, and 
said he could not deny the proposed 
success. It is a new and emerging 
field ... and combines two ground
breaking fields together for the bet
terment of mankind. Biology will go 
far with the marriage of a renowned 
CS school. He also went on to say 
that by having a research center for 
computational biology readily avail
able, prospective students will defi
nitely be attracted to Carnegie Mel
lon, and it could not have come at a 
better tiihe.
One practice that the Lane Cen
ter employs is active learning. This 
process, in basic terminology as 
explained in a separate interview 
by Robert Murphy, director of the 
Lane Center, involves using com
putational models [to] determine 
which experiments are best. 
This will reduce the amount and 
frequency of physical experi
mentation as countless trials can 
be tested virtually.
Murphy also brought up 
the Expeditions Grant, whose 
computational biology focus 
is model checking. This is, as 
Murphy describes, a com
plimentary method to active 
learning that potentially 
allows us to decide whether 
or not a model is internally 
consistent. So, as evident 
from both active learn
ing and model checking, 
computational biology 
can definitely help us 
out as humans.
When discussing 
specific uses, Yeo 
brought up genomics

International Festival on diplomacy wraps week of theater
Wrath playing this week in Purnell
Carnegie Mellons School of Drama 
will perform John Steinbecks The Grapes 
of Wrath every day this week, with* 
the last showing occurring on Oct. 10. 
Directed by professor of acting Barbara 
Mackenzie-Wood, the performances are 
at 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, 
with an additional matinee performance 
at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
The Grapes of Wrath is one of 
Americas favorite novels, and, due to 
the work of the adapter Frank Galati, 
now one of its greatest theatrical inven
tions, said Peter Cooke, "head of the 
School of Drama.
I chose the work to open our sea
son, in collaboration with director 
Mackenzie-Wood, as I believe the play 
holds a mirror up to a contemporary
fiscal and environmental landscape that 
is truly alarming. The theater at its best 
should provoke, move, question, and en
gage, and I hope the audience attending 
the production experiences all of these 
actions.
A story of courage and endurance 
in the face of overwhelming hardship, 
Steinbecks Nobel Prize-winning novel 
examines a family of sharecroppers who 
strive for the American dream in an 
environment that raises, then shatters, 
their hopes, dreams, and aspirations.
Ticket prices begin at $23 for adults, 
$14 for senior citizens, and $10 for stu
dents with valid Carnegie Mellon identi
fication. For complete ticket prices, call

Title: The Humanities Center
Lectures  Global Connections, Global 
Responsibilities
The Basics: Sponsored by the univer
sitys Humanities Center and the Center 
for the Advancement of Applied Ethics 
and Political Philosophy, this lecture 
series focuses on the diversity among 
affluent and economically challenged 
countries and their influence on one 
another.
James Ferguson, professor and chair 
of the department of anthropology at 
Stanford University, will talk about po
litical and social issues in South Africa. 
South Africa has in recent decades gone 
through a wrenching transformation 
from a labor-scarce society to a laborsurplus one.
Labor scarcity through most of the 
19th and 20th centuries led to forms 
of social solidarity and social identity 
that had significant continuities with 
the pre-colonial past. In recent decades, 
however, economic restructuring has 
radically reduced demand for lowskilled, manual labor, and mass unem
ployment has become a durable struc
tural feature of South African society.
When: Today at 4:30 p.m.

Title: University Lecture Series  
The Global Environmental Impact of 
the United States, in Peacetime and 
Wartime
The Basics: Richard Tucker, ad
junct professor of environmental his
tory in the School of Natural Resources 
and Environment at the University of 
Michigan, will discuss the influences of 
the United States on the global environ
ment throughout history.
In the 20th century, a major driv
ing force for global environmental de
terioration was the vast , reach of the 
American economy in its worldwide 
search for natural resources. We are 
only beginning to recognize the global 
ecological consequences of corporate 
enterprise and consumer culture.
This lecture will allow the audience 
to understand the changes in our en
vironment due to the United States 
decisions and how the present global 
environment came to be.
When: Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Title: Listening to Students: Using 
Survey Data to Improve the Student 
Experience
The Basics: This lecture will focus 
on how Carnegie Mellon utilizes stu
dent survey responses to understand 
students experiences. Speakers will; 
include Janel Sutkus, the director of 
Institutional Research and Analysis; 
Indira Nair, Vice provost for educa
tion; and Karen Boyd, dean of Student 
Affairs.
Sutkus is responsible for the anal
ysis of both administrative and aca-; 
demic functions throughout Carnegie 
Mellons campus and especially within 
the colleges. Her Ph.D. is in education 
organizational behavior and manage
ment from the Center for the Study of 
Higher and Post-secondary Education! 
at the University of Michigan.
In the first part of the lecture, Sutkus 
will discuss the standards used to ana
lyze the students of Carnegie Mellon,; 
such as self-assessment, time spent on 
academic versus non-academic activi
ties, opinions of the promotion of the 
universitys values, and meaningful in
teraction with others, among several 
other topics.
When she concludes, Nair and Boyd 
will explain how these methods are 
used to create student opportunities,, to 
make campus resources and prograins 
more accessible, and to develop aca
demic and meta-curricular program
ming.

town when a friend sent him a 
text message about the protest, 
and so he joined a group of Car
negie Mellon and University of 
Pittsburgh students, as well as 
individuals he identified as an
archists.
He referred to the protest as 
quiet, and said that some of 
the protesters who grew bored 
decided to run a few blocks away 
to confuse the police. The po
lice followed them down a block, 
but otherwise did nothing else 
threatening, unlike Branders en
counter. *
He said that it was not until af
ter he was leaving the protest that 
he and the others were arrested. 
While some of the protesters left 
on buses, he was among a group 
who walked from Downtown on 
Forbes. After passing Duquesne 
University, he said, the group no
ticed that they were being trailed 
by a group of police. They were 
also being approached by police 
in front of them.
The officers in front of the 
group told them they could not 
continue up Forbes and needed 
to turn around. It was at this 
point that he said the group was 
trapped, and the police came 
through the crowd to begin ar
resting some of the people.
The student was charged with 
disturbing the peace, and he said 
it was because they had assem
bled too large of a crowd. He was 
detained for several hours at Al
legheny County Jail and will go 
to trial on Oct. 21.

Tuition devoted 
less to instruction
TUITION, fromAl
63 percent. At public community 
colleges, the budget went from 
52.8 percent to 50.2 percent, but 
private research universities, on 
average, suffered the most.
Instruction at private research 
colleges went from being al
located a 62.3 percent share in 
1995 down to 57.9 percent in
2006. Essentially, education 
shares declined everywhere.
Additionally, the portion uni
versities allocated to adminis
tration and support rose every
where.
However, at private research 
institutions, tuition increased to 
match spending on educational 
instruction,' meaning that the 
amount spent on instruction 
rose.
At public research universi
ties, had tuition increased just 
to match educational instruction 
spending, prices would have in
creased only 2.5 percent, as op
posed to 29.8 percent.
Similarly, state and commu
nity college tuition would have 
declined by 2.1 percent and 5.8 
percent instead of rising by 29 
percent and 18.1 percent, re
spectively  in large part due to 
decreases in government spend
ing.
I find it somewhat a portrait 
of society. The rich get richer, the 
poor get poorer, and the middle, 
well, they get poorer too, said 
R.F. Culbertson III, Carnegie 
Mellon professor of entrepre
neurship.
Some students do qualify for 
aid, though, because of their ex
ceptional intelligence or finan
cial circumstances.
I heard once that tuition has 
an element of progressive taxa
tion.
Something like 70 cents of 
every dollar of tuition increase 
is returned to students with 
greater financial need, said Ba
ruch Fischhoff, head of the deci
sion science major at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Students in the American 
middle class are in a tough po
sition, said Sarah Strano, a se
nior civil engineering student at 
Carnegie Mellon. Often, their 
parents cant afford to write a 
check for their tuition, but they 
dont necessarily qualify for a lot 
of aid either. Having to worry 
about paying back student loans 
can significantly decrease the 
opportunities students are will
ing or able to take.
The Delta Projects study does 
suggest that students at Carnegie 
Mellon and other elite private 
research institutions are getting 
an advantageous return on their 
investment.
A reasonable question for any 
institution is whether it provides 
something valuable that stu
dents cant get elsewhere. Id like 
to think that discussions  both 
class and individual  project 
work, and participation in re
search projects here fit that bill, 
Fischoff said.
Culbertson said that the best 
students go to good schools 
that attract the best professors 
and the best-paying jobs  so 
the vicious cycle begins. I actu
ally see CMU  and all the top 
10 institutions  being huge 
beneficiaries of this cycle, and I 
suspect the brand will continue 
to improve because of it.

H1N1 vaccine to 
arrive on Tuesday
The vaccine against the H1N1 
virus is scheduled to arrive in 
21 states and the cities of Washirigton D.C., New York, Chicago, 
and Los Angeles by this Tues
day. Around 600,000 doses will 
arrive at these places.
Additionally, 300,000 doses 
of the antiviral Tamiflu are ex
pected to arrive at various lo
cations over the coming week. 
The initial doses of the vaccine 
will be in the form of a nasal 
spray. Health officials will be 
given the first available doses of 
the H1N1 vaccine.
Health officials do not recom

Vitamin D reduces 
risk of falling
According to research pub
lished in the British Medical 
Journal, a dose of 700-1000 
international units (IU) of vi
tamin D can reduce the risk of 
falling in those over 65 years of 
age. IU is the international unit 
for measuring vitamins.
The research has also shown 
that doses below 700 IU are not 
effective in preventing falls.
Yearly, one in three persons 
over the age of 65 experiences a 
fall and 6 percent of those falls 
can result in fractures.
Thus, vitamin D, which in
creases the strength of the el
derly and also improves their 
balance, could help prevent 
such falls.

responsible for 8 percent of all 
the cancers in Europe.
Some studies have shown 
that in the United States, obe
sity was responsible for almost 
20 percent of all cancers.
Scientists believe that with 
more people quitting smoking, 
obesity may soon become the 
leading cause of cancer within 
the next decade or so.
Of all the cancers linked to 
being overweight, colorectal 
cancer, breast cancer, and en
dometrial cancer accounted for 
65 percent.
Although scientists are un
sure of why obesity can cause 
cancer, they believe that it has 
to do with the fact that more 
hormones are released with 
obesity. Hormones like estro
gen, secreted in excess, could 
help tumors grow.

Anti-smoking drug 
may not cause suicide
In July, the United States or
dered black box warnings on 
anti-smoking drugs like Chantix and Zyban following re
ports of depression and suicidal 
thoughts following the use of 
these drugs.
However, recent research 
published in the British Medical 
Journal shows that there is no 
strong evidence indicating that 
Chantix is linked to suicide.
The findings were based off 
of data obtained from 80,660 
people who used such drugs 
from Sept. 2006 to May 2008. 
Researchers did not find any 
reports of serious mental health 
problems in these users while 
they were using these drugs or 
even three months after they 
stopped using them.

Evidence proves presence of water on moon
ABHAY BUCH
Junior Staffwriter
After much debate and with 
some degree of disbelief, scien
tists have announced in Science 
that they have conclusive proof 
that there is water on the moon. 
While the current findings speak 
of minuscule amounts, the au
thors are cautiously optimistic 
that more will be found on suc
ceeding missions.
The actual discovery was made 
by the Moon Mineralogy Map
per, or M3, built and operated 
by the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA). 
The M3was fitted on the Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe launched 
and operated by the Indian 
Space Research Organization 
(ISRO). Many of the scientists 
involved were suspicious of the 
results and sought corroboratory 
data, which they found in the 
information collected by NASAs 
Deep Impact (2005) and Cassini 
(1997) missions. These two mis
sions had previously directed 
sensors similar to the M3 toward 
the moon. However, their find
ings had not been fully analyzed 
due to the fact that their primary 
missions did not involve the 
moon. They had merely used the 
moon to configure their sensors. 
The data was further corrobo
rated by NASAs Lunar Recon
naissance Orbiter (2009 and still 
active). Indeed, rocks brought 
back to Earth by the Apollo mis
sions had also shown evidence 
of water, but this was written off 
as contamination by the humid 
Houston air.
According to an interview with 
one of the co-authors of the pa
per, Lawrence Taylor, director of 
the Planetary Geosciences Insti
tute at the University of Tennes
see at Knoxville, the most popu
lar hypothesis for the formation 
of water is that it is due to the re
action of solar wind protons with 
a highly reactive soil. The moon 
is subjected to intense ultraviolet 
radiation and other influences, 
which cause the particles in its 
soil to become highly unstable 
and reactive.
This is because the radiation 
breaks the bonds between atoms 
in the molecules. Many of these 
unstable particles are oxygen at
oms. When an atom attached to 
another atom is knocked away 
by ultraviolet radiation, it leaves 
a sort of void which renders the 
remaining atom unstable.
These voids are what Taylor 
calls dangling bonds, which

need particles like protons to 
stabilize them. The sun ejects a 
constant stream of such protons 
(the solar wind), some of which 
are captured by the lunar soil, 
forming OH and H20 molecules. 
According to Taylor, When sun
light hits a substance, it reflects 
certain wavelengths which are 
signatures of its composition. 
The M3 was looking for the signa
ture associated with OH and H20 
with a device called a reflecting 
spectrometer, which measures 
wavelengths that are just a bit 
longer than those that are visible 
to us.
Comets, often called dirty 
icebergs, may also be a possible 
contributor to water resources. 
They occasionally strike the 
moon and may leave significant 
deposits of water when they do.
One important thing to note 
is that the distribution of water 
changes constantly as it evapo
rates  the moon has no atmo
sphere, and water can evaporate 
at the extremely low tempera
tures found there. This evapora
tion is much more pronounced 
closer to the equator, where there 
is more sunlight and higher tem
peratures. Less water was found 
in the equatorial regions than 
closer to the poles.
The authors theorize that 
much of the water accumulates 
in regions that Taylor calls cold 
traps, permanently shadowed 
craters where evaporation is less 
likely to occur and where tem
peratures never rise above -380 
degrees Fahrenheit. As Taylor 
explains, Sit down with a glass 
of iced tea in front of you, wait 
about two minutes, and youll see 
it starts to perspire. Its gathering 
moisture out of the air. This is an 
example of a cold trap, a region 
that is colder than its surround
ings, attracting and collecting 
moisture. These may provide us
able sources of water for future 
lunar missions. "j
Serendipitously, NASA actu
ally has a mission in progress to 
find water in such cold traps. 
Called LCROSS (Lunar Crater 
Observation and Sensing Satel
lite), it will  at around 7:30
a.m., Oct. 9  launch its own 
spent rocket engine at a crater in 
order to generate a plume of de
bris. If there is indeed water ice 
present in the shadowed areas of
the crater, the plume could be as 
high as 70 kilometers. The probe 
itself will then fly through the 
plume and see if it can find any 
evidence of water. Spectroscopes 
and telescopes on Earth will also 
be directed toward the plume.
While the authors of the paper 
are certain that there is water, 
they are not yet sure if it is actu
ally usable and are being cautious 
as to the ways in which the water 
might be employed. It is easy to 
see, however, that if the water is 
usable, it would make a big dif
ference for NASAs plan to build 
a base on the moon (to be set up 
by 2024, according to National 
Geographic). With the presence 
of water, oxygen and fuel in the 
form of hydrogen would be avail
able, simplifying the process and 
reducing the amount of both ele
ments that will have to be carried 
there.
 The discovery of water on the 
moon is significant not just be
cause of the technical skill in
volved or the direct results, but 
also because it implies greater 
possibilities and allows human
ity to hope that the moon is not 
as harsh a mistress as she seems.
How Things Work: Microsofts Sensecam
ZACHARIAS GEORGE
Junior Staffwriter
Human memory is not without 
faults, and forgetfulness is one 
such characteristic fault of mem
ory. The idea of storing and im
planting memories has existed in 
science fiction for decades. Philip 
K. Dick, in his novelette We Can 
Remember It for You Wholesale,
describes a procedure for im
planting prefabricated memories 
in a patients mind. While creat
ing and implanting memories to
day seems a far-fetched concept, 
recording memories is not new. 
Man has recorded scenes from 
his life on cave walls, canvas, 
celluloid, and, of late, even on 
silicon.
An average photographer 
would take a series of timedisconnected pictures or videos 
while not recording any particu
lar event in its entirety. There
fore, as a recording of 
memories, this 
system yields 
an incomplete 
documenta
tion of the 
particular 
scene. A 
team at Mi
crosoft Re
search has 
attempted 
to overcome 
this problem 
by devising a 
camera with 
certain built-in 
sensors that auto
matically take pic
tures of the users envi
ronment.
This provides a constant 
stream of pictures, similar 
to those in a movie reel, only 
separated by a few seconds in 
time. The team christened the 
camera Sensecam.
This is the main input device 
for MyLifeBits, a project run by 
Microsoft Research. The goal 
of this project is to provide a
Courtesy of www.wikipedia.org
means by which a user can docu
ment and browse through his 
memories using pictures, vid
eos, and other media. In 1945, 
the American engineer Vannevar Bush proposed a system 
that would allow the user to sift 
through media using hyperlinks. 
He called it Memex, a portman
teau of memory and index. This 
system was vaguely similar to 
the World Wide Web as we know 
it today, and the idea has been 
adopted for the MyLifeBits proj
ect.
According to a paper published 
by the Microsoft Research team, 
the Sensecam is fitted with a 
number of sensors that measure 
such parameters as body heat 
and motion, among others. An 
onboard microcontroller moni
tors the status of the different 
sensors and makes decisions re
garding the capturing of images. 
The camera can be set to take pic
tures every 30 seconds, though it 
also automatically takes pictures 
if any of the sensors detect inter
esting occurrences. For example, 
a camera around the users neck 
will take pictures every 30 sec
onds and will also capture on 
film any person who steps in 
front of the user.
Existing models are provided 
with 1GB of memory, allowing 
the device to store up to 30,000 
images captured by its VGA cam
era. The fish-eye lens allows for 
a much wider area to be photo
graphed, making the pictures 
more faithful to images captured 
by the human eye. The recharge
able battery attached allows the 
camera to operate for periods 
longer than 24 hours, assuming 
it captures an image every 30 
seconds.
Capturing memories is only
half the objective. The team has 
also created an application to 
navigate through the many pho
tos that the camera takes. This 
software can smooth out pictures 
that are distorted by the fish-eye 
lens, edit poor quality pictures, 
and rapidly display pictures as a 
time-compressed slide show in a 
method known as rapid serial vi
sual presentation.
The Sensecam was initially 
meant to be a camera to help pa
tients suffering from memory ail
ments. It was meant to be worn 
by the patient or clipped onto a 
belt or pocket, from where it can 
take pictures. The pictures are 
then stored and reviewed by the 
patient to recall various memo
ries.
The Sensecam is not currently 
available for personal use, and 
only a handful have been made
 only for research purposes. 
The biggest user of the Sensecam 
is Gordon Bell, a researcher work
ing with Microsoft Research. He 
has volunteered to be the first 
test user of the MyLifeBits. Bell 
carries a Sensecam with him 
most days, makes a copy of all 
his bills, and even documents the 
different sites he visits online.
To date, his e-memories ex
ceed 350GB of stored data, and 
he constantly adds to his bank of 
memories. When CNN asked Bell 
if he felt this kind of technology 
would make humans mentally 
sluggish, he stated that it was 
one of the general concerns, but 
he did not believe that would be 
the case.
To me, I feel a lot freer. In a 
way, I feel like I still remember 
all that stuff, but I generally re
member that [the computer is] 
remembering something for me 
so I can find it, he said. >

Scientists find old 
fossil of skeleton
A fossil of the skeleton of a 
human ancestor, nearly 4.4 
million years old, was found in 
Africa recently. The skeleton 
belongs to the species Ardipithecus ramidus and has replaced 
the famous skeleton Lucy as the 
oldest known human ancestor.
The fossil was of an adult 
female weighing around 120 
pounds and standing four feet 
tall. The feet of the specimen 
had not developed the curved 
arch found in humans, and the 
length of the arms and legs re
sembled that of primitive apes 
or even monkeys. Scientists be
lieve that this new Ardipithecus 
genus has helped clarify many 
doubts regarding the evolution 
of humans.

Telescope uses 
infrared light
The Herschel Space Tele
scope, launched by the Euro
pean Space Agency, has cap
tured images of the Milky Way 
galaxy using infrared light. The 
telescope was able to sense the 
small amount of heat radiating 
from some of the coldest objects 
in the galaxy, using infrared 
light.
The telescope was able to ob
tain images from a region of the 
galaxy that is usually obscured 
in normal light. The images re
vealed that a number of stars 
are being born in this region 
and that this region contains a 
large amount of cold and unsta

shown that gas is constantly 
condensing in this region and 
that young stars in all stages of 
development are interspersed 
throughout the region.

proteins and induce the destruc
tion of the cell by macrophages, 
which engulf and digest the vi
ruses. One of the vaccinations 
was an injection of proteins 
found on the surface of hu
man immunodeficiency viruses 
(HIV). With the injection, more 
antibodies .would be produced, 
reducing the likelihood of con
tracting AIDS. Unfortunately, 
on its own, the protein vaccina
tion did not produce a sufficient 
number of antibodies.
The second vaccine involves 
the white blood cell response in 
the body. There are two types of 
T cells involved in immune re-, 
sponse: helper T cells (Th cells) 
and cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells.) 
The Th cells are involved in all 
aspects of the immune system, 
including the production of an
tibodies.
Individuals develop AIDS 
when the Th cells are infected 
by HIV. The Tc cell specifically 
recognizes proteins on HIV and 
kills them. The second vaccina
tion increases the population 
of Tc cells in the body, allowing 
more foreign cells to be identi
fied and killed. This method did 
not work on its own, however, 
and researchers speculate that 
the bodys resources would de
plete in the production of Tc cells 
and cause even more harmful 
effects. It is important to note 
that RV144 is not completely 
protective. The methods in
volved in vaccinations only offer 
partially preventive measures, 
since the vaccination does noth
ing to lower the level of HIV in 
the bloodstream after infection. 
Rule advised, People shouldnt 
be careless..
Of the future for AIDS re
search, Rule said, The first thing 
I would try to do would be to see 
if you could boost or enhance 
the immune response, especially 
with the Tc cell activation, to see 
if you could put different HIV 
proteins on there that would 
lead to more responsive Tc cells. 
He also discussed changing how 
the vaccinations were applied. 
Varying the schedule of when 
people were vaccinated may im
prove the response.

It has eluded scientists for 
nearly half a century. It has 
been one of the biggest issues 
in the medical field. And now, 
in a Thailand laboratory, a sig
nificant step has been taken in 
prevention of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS): 
ScientJSts have developed a vac
cination that shows more po
tential in preventing AIDS than 
ever before. The experimental 
process was the largest and most 
expensive AIDS research project 
ever conducted. With 16,000 
participants, the entire process 
cost a total of $105 million. The 
study began six years ago, and 
only now has it reached a pal
pable conclusion.
According to the National In
stitute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, one of the organiza
tions that conducted the study, 
the experiment tested a new 
type of vaccination known as 
RV144. In the two experimental 
groups  one of which received 
the vaccination while the other 
received a placebo  the vac
cinated participants contracted 
AIDS at almost one-third the rate 
of the control group. The partici
pants consisted of individuals 
aged 18-30 from several prov
inces near Bangkok and they 
were recruited from the general 
population, rather than from sex 
workers, drug injectors, or any 
other high-risk groups.
Gordon Rule, a biochemistry 
and immunology professor in the 
biological sciences department 
of the Mellon College of Science, 
expressed his pleasure at the dis
covery Its a big step forward, 
Rule said. The RV144 vaccina
tion itself consisted of two sep
arate vaccinations, neither of 
which worked effectively by it
self. The two different vaccines 
were directed at two different 
immune responses, Rule said. 
When the immune response rec
ognizes proteins on the surface 
of h Virus as foreign, the body 
produces antibodies (known as 
neutralizing antibodies). The

On his first visit to the Carn
egie Mellon Caf, electrical and 
computer engineering masters 
student 'Isaac Jones got an un
expected surprise. His chocolate 
shake hid a toxin-laden garnish ^n 
the form of a rolled wafer cookie 
 Jones is allergic to the hazel
nut contained in the cookies fill-. 
ing. Nuts are common irritants 
for those who suffer oral allergy 
syndrome  a fancy name for 
allergies that originate from the 
mouth, or food allergies. Along 
with nuts, many fruits and veg
etables also set off allergic reac
tions in sensitive individuals.
For Jones, the list includes not 
only a variety of tree nuts (not 
peanuts or pine nuts  they are 
not technically nuts, as the for
mer is a bean and the latter a 
seed) but also some vegetables 
like carrots and celery.
When Jones eats an estimated 
four or five baby carrots, he be
gins to experience what he de
scribes as a tingling in his mouth 
and uncomfortable restriction 
in his throat. Allergy symptoms 
are caused by mistakes in the im
mune system. According to Dis
covery Healths website, the body 
produces antibodies to anything 
it perceives as a foreign invader. 
In the case of allergens, the im
mune system incorrectly identi
fies certain chemicals as toxic. 
This is what creates the allergic 
response.
In vegetables, the body is react
ing to specific proteins in the cell 
walls. These proteins are impor
tant in the structure of the cell 
wall. One such protein, called an 
extensin, ties together the outer 
and inner layers of the cell wall. 
Similarly, Jones allergy to tree 
nuts is also set off by a protein. 
However, there is no evidence 
that the two allergies are related. 
Jones explained that while he ex
periences very similar symptoms 
when he eats nuts, he also begins 
to salivate uncontrollably. When 
Jones was a sophomore in high 
school, he had his first encoun
ter with nut allergy. At a Super 
Bowl party, he was eating from 
a bowl of mixed nuts  mostly
cashews and hazelnuts  when 
he found his mouth was tingling. 
His mother, an emergency room 
doctor, advised him to avoid nuts 
in the future.
Later on, Jones began to feel a 
similar reaction when eating car
rots. While he did not commonly 
eat many nuts as a child, he said, 
it was reasonably common to 
have a package of raw carrots in 
lunches. They were very often an 
after-school snack.
While it is more common for 
allergies to be lost during pu
berty, an article by the Canadian 
Society of Allergy and Clini
cal Immunology explained that 
the chemical changes the body 
undergoes during puberty may 
cause allergies to either worsen 
or even develop during adoles
cence.
Allergies that develop in later 
life are most commonly airborne 
allergies, however. Allergist Clif
ford Bassett, M.D., explained 
that many times, oral allergy 
syndrome is connected to sea
sonal airborne allergies  one 
out of every three people who 
suffer seasonal allergies may ex
perience oral allergy symptoms.
Specific kinds of pollen that 
set off seasonal allergies relate to 
foods that are genetically simi
lar. For example, people who find 
their nose running when they 
encounter ragweed pollen are
more likely to be allergic to ba
nanas or melons. In the case of 
Jones allergy, carrots and celery 
are related  both are part of 
the parsley family, including not 
only parsley, but also dill, anise, 
cumin, coriander, and mugwort. 
However, Jones said, Ive never 
knowingly consumed raw mug
wort or dill in quantities that 
would be large enough to trigger 
a reaction.
One important element of that 
statement is the word raw: in 
those who suffer oral allergy 
syndrome, the food irritant is no 
longer effective when the food 
has been cooked. The website of 
the Childrens Hospital of Phila
delphia explains why: The cook
ing process changes the protein 
enough that the immune system 
does not recognize [the allergen] 
anymore. Like anyone with al
lergies, Jones must pay close at
tention to what he eats to ensure 
he does not react negatively to 
the food. Though he can no lon
ger eat ants on a log  a raw 
celery stick with peanut butter 
and raisins he used to enjoy as a 
child  he is aware of his limi
tations. Now he knows not to eat 
the wafer cookie in his next Car
negie Mellon Caf milkshake; he 
can give it to his friend instead.

Police response to riots unnecessarily harsh
Welcome to the unlawful assembly. 
Please fasten your seat belts tightly 
around your waists, note we have riot 
troops surroiinding all the exits, whose 
guns are loaded with rubber bullets. In 
the event of tear gassing, oxygen masks 
will not be provided, so be prepared to 
cry. Please relax as you begin your final 
dispersal while several of your fellow 
passengers are arrested. Thank you for 
flying G20 Pittsburgh Air.
This is, of course, the scene at Schenley 
Plaza late last week recast as a particu
larly bad airplane trip. Why? Because we 
have all heard this story told and re-told 
since the G20 ended; we have seen the 
videos; we have heard the official reports 
and the news coverage. Yet we are still 
trying to put together the events in our 
own heads; we are still trying to make 
sense of the events in Oakland.
Why are students showing up with 
bruises on their bodies? Why were Carn
egie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh 
students held overnight in Allegheny 
County Jail? Why is YouTube filled with 
videos of students trapped in stairwells 
and shoved to the ground? How did 
this happen in our city; what did we do 
wrong? How could the police here have 
possibly been that cruel, that brutal?
These questions will not all be an
swered to our and your satisfaction, but 
we can now begin to reflect on what oc
curred. The G20 came like a whirlwind 
and inconvenienced people across Pitts
burgh. It shut down parks, streets, and 
institutions of higher education so that 
the most powerful rulers of our modern 
world could have dinner and shape our 
futures. Not everything went according 
to plan, and we wish some events would 
have unfolded differently.
We could wish a bit more common 
sense into the college kids who believe 
that by simply standing and gawking at
what seemed to be a scene from a mov
ie, they were innocent. Simply by being 
present at the protest, they were taking 
part in an assembly, a non-registered, 
after-hours gathering of protesters and 
passersby that was deemed unaccept
able. And some got caught up in events 
that they could certainly have avoided by 
staying in their homes and rooms.
And while they could have stayed 
home, they didnt. Many behaved like it 
was a normal Friday night in Oakland, 
which to the police lining the streets was 
most certainly an unfamiliar sight. We 
do wish the police would have used less 
force; it was not necessary. They could 
have been kinder to the protesters who 
by all accounts were mostly college kids 
with cell phones and a bit too much cu
riosity. But even as our city and our stu
dents may feel beaten, the trip is over, 
the plane is landed, and we wont be fly
ing with that airline again.
Pgh. kids without vaccines forced to stay home
When a child has not been vaccinated 
and has the potential to spread highly 
contagious diseases  or cannot prove 
that they were vaccinated with a viable 
shot record  the child should not go to 
school. We dont need any scares like that 
of the swine flu in colleges in elementary, 
middle, or high schools.
But there are always extenuating cir
cumstances  what if your family just 
moved to the area and the shot records 
are still being sent? According to Alleghe
ny County regulations, that student shall 
not attend school if there is no present 
documentation proving that he or she 
has been properly vaccinated.
As of last Thursday, at least 4000 stu
dents were barred from attending school
if they had not received the proper vac
cinations, or if they could not provide 
proof. We understand the school officials 
concerns over the health and safety of ev
eryone in the Allegheny school district, 
but applying such a broad standard may 
not be the best remedy.
In the case of the 4000 students, many 
of their shot records are missing. Missing 
documents of a shot, especially since in 
many cases, the shots were administered, 
shouldnt keep a child out of school.
And by being so willing to keep stu
dents from attending school on the off 
chance that they might spread uncom
mon illnesses, the schools are creating 
problems for themselves in the future. 
Often, it is not possible to get a doctors
appointment for the very next day, tak
ing up time in which the students could 
be learning and time that will have to be 
made up. In addition, for the students 
who already have been vaccinated but 
have missing records, they are missing 
school for absolutely no reason. This 
means more work for the students and 
staffwork that could have been avoid
ed.
Keeping students out of school for 
health concerns is valid, but perhaps the 
administration should come up with a 
compromise, and provide on-site after
school clinics where students could eas
ily and quickly get vaccinations.
We hope the county is as cooperative 
as possible with the students.
U.S. senators vote down health care amendments
By now, almost every American is 
aware of President Obamas push for 
health care reform. One of the most pro
gressive ideas involved has been the cre
ation of a government-run public health 
insurance option that would compete 
with private insurance companies.
On Tuesday, the Senates finance com
mittee turned down two amendments to 
include this option on what CNN: com 
refers to as the only compromise health 
care bill so far.
In an expected party divide, all of the 
Republican senators on the committee 
rejected the amendments proposed by 
Democratic senators Jay Rockefeller and
Charles Schumer. However, the amend
ment also lacked the support of commit
tee chair Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) 
because he was afraid the Republicans 
on the Senate would filibuster the bill to 
death if such an option were included, as 
reported by The New York Times.
The inclusion of a more affordable gov
ernment-run insurance plan would force 
private companies to reconsider rates to 
remain competitive.
Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) 
argued that such competition would ul
timately drive private companies out of 
business, effectively creating a government-run health care system.
This government-run health care sys
tem Republican senators are so fright
ened of operates successfully in Canada. 
The idea that a public insurance option 
would lead to socialized medicine  a 
system like that of many industrialized 
nations  is considered nothing more 
than hot air by 59 percent of Americans.
At the moment, the health care bill of
fers only small nonprofit cooperatives as 
an alternative to expensive private insur
ance plans. At some point, America needs 
to hop on the bandwagon being ridden 
by the rest of the world, because our 
stubborn resistance is crippling America
 literally and figuratively.
Illegal immigrants should 
follow United States laws
AMANDA COLE
The discussion about illegal immigra
tion in the United States  and what to 
do about it  has taken a new turn with 
the Obama administration. This week, 
American Apparels Los Angeles factory 
was forced to fire nearly 2000 workers, 
all of whom were illegal immigrants. In 
the past, the workers would have been 
deported back to their home countries, 
but now they are just being told that they 
are not allowed to work in the United 
States.
Supposedly, this is being done in order 
to preserve families and cause the least 
amount of trouble. While this may be 
true, it still is not right. If a person breaks 
the law, in this country or anywhere 
else, and they are caught, they must face 
the consequences. If the consequences 
of people coming into and living in the 
United States illegally are only that they 
lose their jobs, what kind of message are 
we sending?
People who are in this country illegally 
should not be permitted to stay, regard
less of whether they are working for 
American businesses or whether they are 
unemployed. It isnt about whether they 
are paying taxes or whether they are tak
ing jobs that Americans should have, be
cause, jets face it: Most of the jobs illegal 
immigrants have are jobs that the major
ity of Americans wouldnt want to work.
Rather, it is about respect for the 
law. Immigration laws are in place for 
a reason, and even if people disagree 
with them, until they are changed, they 
should be respected. It is incredibly frus
trating that people who seem to want to 
be in this country are disobeying its laws 
from the very start.
I understandthat it is often difficult to
get into this country legally, but that does 
not justify breaking the law. Anything 
worth doing is worth waiting for, and if 
someone really wants to be an American 
citizen, they will wait as long as neces
sary to do it through legal means.
In many cases, .illegal immigrants in 
the United States are looking for ways 
to earn money, not citizenship. They 
are here to work, and they then, send 
the money back to their families, if this 
is what they want, they should apply for 
work visas and come legally; this will be 
better not only for the United States, but 
also for the immigrants, Work conditions 
will be better monitored and minimum 
pay will be enforced  benefits that il
legal immigrants generally do not cur
rently receive.
A common argument in favor of 
changing immigration laws and grant
ing amnesty to those illegal immigrants 
already in this country is that people are 
unable to afford to immigrate legally, 
emphasizing that it is expensive and time 
consuming to become a legal citizen of 
the United States. Perhaps this argument 
comes from a growing need to have in
stant gratification. Throughout history, 
when immigrants came to this country 
in great surges, they saved their money, 
often for years and years, to be able to af
ford to do so. For the most part, people 
came legally. They went through the ap
propriate steps to become citizens, even 
if that was a long and painful process. To
days immigrants should be no different; 
they should also have to follow the4egal 
guidelines for immigration.
Everyone should have the opportunity 
to make a better life, but this opportunity 
should be seized through legal means 
and not through breaking the laws of the 
country to which one desires entry.

Eastern women harmed more 
than helped by Western media
MARIUM CHANDNA
In the past, violence against women 
in South Asia and the Middle East was 
largely taken as an inevitable part of life. 
Eastern women were often not just vic
tims of abuse at home, but also criticized 
by their Western counterparts for being 
passive and poor portraits of feminism.
However, when specific cases of forced 
marriage and gang rape in those regions 
sprung to international attention, it be
came apparent that this violence was not 
an inherent ingredient of any culture. 
While the Western media was quick to 
transform the victims into heroes, the 
celebrity status came with a price  pro
longed scrutiny of these womens lives.
Without realizing that the reality tele
vision culture is not the preferred ticket 
to fame in many cultures, Western media 
does more harm than good by putting 
these women under the spotlight. Two 
examples that illustrate this are the sto
ries of Mukhtar Mai and Nujood Ali.
In 2002, Mai took the media by storm 
when she pressed charges against her 
rapists in a country where society de
mands silence from rape victims. Mai 
was gang raped by six men on the orders 
of a council of tribal elders, which is akin 
to legal authority in the impoverished vil
lage of Meerwala where Mai resides.
Despite her circumstances, Mai did not' 
commit suicide, which is often the cho
sen course of action for raped women 
in Pakistan, as it signifies cleansing the 
tainted reputation of the victims family.
She took her rapists to court, only to 
discover that five of the six men were
released. Mai was awarded about $8000 
from the government, which she used to 
establish the Mukhtar Mai Womens Wel
fare Organization, a center for educa
tion, rehabilitation, and refuge for rural 
women. Mai became a symbol of courage 
and hope for oppressed women.
However, Mais image as a brave.and 
progressive woman seemed to pale when 
she married a police constable who was 
responsible for her security. Mais mar
riage was conditional; she married her 
husband in order, to prevent him from 
divorcing his first wife  a threat he 
repeatedly gave her along with suicide 
if she turned down his proposal. How
ever, Mais personal decisions should be 
viewed in the context of her own culture 
and should not be a point of disapproval.
Similarly, 10-year-old Ali set an exam
ple for victims of child marriages. When 
Ali was beaten and raped by her husband, 
she hailed a cab and took it to the court
house, where she demanded a divorce.
Ali vehemently avoids any media atten
tion; she unwillingly sat with CNN for a 
recent interview because the news chan
nel had earned permission from her par
ents in advance. At this point, the media 
needs to leave the child alone instead of 
trailing an already tortured individual.
Acknowledgment of these heroic wom
en by the West is highly appreciated. But 
the constant scrutiny of their personal 
lives is unfair and detrimental to their 
emotional well-being. In the name of em
powering these women, the Western me
dia claims ownership of these heroes 
and builds certain expectations of them, 
which if not met, portray these women as 
symbols of continued passivity.

fMRImatch.com: Online dating, scientific mating
CYNTHIA PENG
I tty not to use my knowledge 
for evil purposes. With that being 
said, fMRImatch.com is probably 
the best unethical idea Ive had, 
ever. Not that there have been 
many. fMRImatch.com is a dating 
website where one is matched via 
the most important component of 
compatibility: the brain. Ignoring 
the fact that I have morals, and 
the fact that I know little about 
braini imaging, absolutely noth
ing about online dating, and next 
to zilch about business and entre
preneurship, I decided to take my 
brainchild and run with it.
It seems that most dating web
sites-suck. You take some quiz, 
and wait and see which losers 
have' similar answers on said 
quiz. I would imagine it feels like 
youre being psycho-evaluated, 
clicking through strongly agree 
to neutral to strongly disagree 
buttons. I strongly agree that 
these quizzes suck.
On the other hand, functional 
magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) doesnt suck. Its 2009, 
people! Matchmaking has got to 
get more scientific. If you really 
think about it, public opinion is 
largely driven by fanatical crowds 
with little regard to scientific un
derpinnings (read: those miracle 
pill mails in your spam folder). 
They just have to be told that its 
scientific. And functional mag
netic, resonance imaging sounds 
pretty damn scientific.
Without sounding like a text
book. you should know that fMRI 
is a ,$piffy new form of neuroim
aging that measures the hemo
dynamic response in the brain. I 
could tell you more about hemo
globin-dependent measures, ce
rebral blood flow, magnetic sus
ceptibility, glucose, oxygen, etc., 
but those are just fancy words 
for the fact that we stick peo
ples heads in giant magnets and
watch the blood flow through 
their brain, allowing scientists to 
get a glimpse inside. Like God. Or 
McDreamy from GreyAnatomy.
What Im proposing is a re
markably high-resolution way to 
look at neural structures in the 
brain for a humanitarian purpose. 
(Theres nothing more humani
tarian than helping people find 
love.) Experimental subjects  I 
mean valued customers  would 
come in for a short scanning ses
sion to acquire their neural im
ages. This would be most ideal 
since fMRI has been noted for its 
low invasiveness and lack of ra
diation exposure, which means 
that unlike other dating sites 
deep probing questions, you will 
come out unscathed.
In science and medicine 
a.k.a. normal, non-sketchy  
fields this technology is usually 
used in, one can take advantage 
of the fact that fMRI is amenable 
to event-related design. This 
means that in addition to get
ting astructural image of your 
brain, we can tell you to look at 
or think about certain things and 
see which parts of the brain get 
activated at that point in time. 
So if the amygdala, the struc
ture responsible for emotion and 
arousal, gets activated in males, 
were going to assume its sex. If 
the amygdala in women gets ac
tivated, were going to assume 
its about shoes. Again, very hightech, very scientifically accurate.
I havent yet worked out exact
ly how were going to determine 
if two brains are compatible. The 
best Ive got is to go by some arbi
trary standard, pull out a number 
from midair, and tell people that 
they are x percent compatible. 
No need to hire neuroscientists 
and statisticians to analyze voxel 
patterns or run ANCOVAs. Like I 
said, the public is susceptible to 
being airheadedly swayed.
Since my brilliant brainchild 
obviously has a lot of kinks, I con
sulted the best in the field to find 
out how to make it better. I asked 
the opinion of a trusted friend
who knows a lot about relation
ships. She glossed over my bloodoxygen-level-dependent explana
tion of how fMRI works, being 
more concerned whether pic
tures of peoples faces were going 
to be on their profile. I said that 
this would defeat the purpose 
of the site, since compatibility 
is going to be based on scientifi
cally driven neural structure and 
activation, not how hot people 
think their peers are, like on subpar sites such as eHarmony and 
match.com. She said I was being 
too dry and should work on the 
fuzzy feeling other sites have.
So in response to that, I remem
bered that fMRI has a high spatial 
resolution of 2 to 3 millimeters.
This would allow you and your 
mate to admire the sheer beauty 
of your brains. This is possible, of 
course: A business major friend 
informed me of the business tac
tic that people feel better when 
you throw in freebies. Easy  Ill 
throw in a couple of free neural 
images. Successful couples can 
frame them side-by-side or what
ever. Youll get the love of your 
life and a free framed picture of 
your brain! Theres your fuzzy 
feeling for you.
Lastly, I consulted a fellow 
neuroimaging colleague whom 
I dearly trust. He fired questions 
at me, including what magnitude 
scanner would produce the best 
results, the effects .of poor tempo
ral resolution and non-localized 
causality, and the process of back
ing up data with electroencepha
lography or magnetoencephalography  basically things I failed 
to consider, dont really care for, 
and am too lazy to figure out.
But were not going to accredit 
the lack of progress on this idea 
to my laziness. When it comes 
down to it, I have morals. Like I 
said, I try not to use my knowl
edge for evil.

SayWhat?i
Abortion issue needs to be separated from health care debate to allow majority
The word abortion imme
diately draws up powerful feel
ings in many people; the topic 
shows up almost daily in one 
news source or another. Its most 
recent hot-button reference is its 
connection to the major debate 
in Washington: the health care is
sue.' If not center stage, abortion 
has'certainly taken a spotlight in 
the health care debates.
What it amounts to is that abor
tion opponents in the Senate and 
the House are fighting to block 
women who are receiving federal 
subsidies for their health insur
ance from selecting plans that 
maycover abortions.
There are many private insur
ance companies from which free 
Americans have the right to se
lect. One of the effects of the bill 
going through Congress is to help 
lowerand middle-income Ameri
cans afford insurance by subsidiz
ing that cost. Pro-life advocates 
are attempting to block any insur
ance company that might cover 
aboftions from that choice.
Health insurance covers a lot of 
things  depending on the com
pany. Regardless of anyones opin
ions on abortions, the free market 
can only thrive if consumers are 
able to make informed choices 
among many alternatives.
Abortion has now overshad
owed the myriad implications 
that this health care reform 
could carry. Hospitals are suffer
ing because patients cant afford 
procedures that insurance wont 
cover. Many people go without 
insurance because the premiums 
are too high. And now the bill 
that could alleviate some of these 
problems is being delayed further 
because some pro-life pundits are 
afraid that government money 
might be funding abortions.
The literal meaning of that 
phrase would suggest that the 
government is paying for women 
to have abortions performed. 
Since this is clearly not-happening, the reasoning stands at this: 
The government would be help
ing to subsidize the cost of insur
ance for lowerand middle-class 
individuals to put Americans on 
more equal footing in terms of 
their health care. Some of the 
health plans that women might 
choose might cover them if they
ever opted to have an abortion. 
Ergo, the government would be 
funding their abortions. Or not.
Federal restrictions on financ
ing abortions have been in place 
since 1976, according to the Chi
cago Tribune, when Medicaid was 
banned from funding abortions 
unless the woman in question 
either would have her life threat
ened by carrying to full term or 
became pregnant as a result of 
rape or incest.
The New York Times reported on 
Wednesday that Senate Finance 
Committee Chair Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.) authored a bill that 
would force insurance companies 
that allowed abortions to separate 
money to be used for abortions 
from the consumers premiums. 
This was a clear move to take the 
question of government funds 
being put toward abortions out 
of discussion so that the bill could 
be sent through the proper chan
nels and dealt with in a timely 
manner.
As expected, however, the 
move was not strong enough for 
the pro-life side of the equation. 
Republicans in the Senate were
of U.S. citizens fairly-priced
not satisfied with having mere ac
counting technicalities determine 
the difference between individu
als paying for their own abor
tions and taxpayers doing so.
In response, Republican Sena
tor Orrin G. Hatch of Utah pro
posed an amendment that would 
essentially blacklist any health 
plan that included coverage of 
abortions. No money from the 
health care legislation would be 
offered to any insurance plan if 
that plan might cover abortions.
Such an idea would force insur
ance companies to either change 
their policies so they would be 
able to compete or else die in a 
market where socially conser
vative companies get the upper 
hand. Fortunately for the insur
ance market, the finance commit
tee voted down the amendment.
It would seem social conser
vatives are trying to press their 
opinions on all Americans  crit
ics of the idea to have insurance 
companies separate the money 
cite that the government subsi
dies would still help people to af
ford health coverage that would 
include abortions.
insurance coverage
Another New York Times article 
cited a Kaiser Family Founda
tion survey showing that half of 
American women covered by an 
employer-sponsored health plan 
have policies that would cover 
abortions. If forced to choose be
tween paying more for a plan that 
would cover abortions and having 
the government help pay for one 
that wouldnt, most people would 
opt for the latter.
Another option brought up 
by conservatives is that women 
could opt to purchase supplemen
tal insurance to cover abortions. 
The problem with this is that most 
women will not anticipate having 
an unwanted pregnancy.
The power of abortion is al
lowing an only marginally related 
issue to overshadow the concern 
on the table: Health care in Amer
ica needs to see some changes, 
because the current state of af
fairs benefits no one.

ALLIES sponsors 
many activities 
for Pride month
Joe Eliot DeGolia
It would be a lie if I were to say 
that during my time here at Car
negie Mellon I have become less 
involved. It would also be a lie if 
I said I didnt embrace Carnegie 
Mellons crowning attribute  di
versity. One of the ways I like to 
balance my many roles and keep 
my sanity is either to make lists 
or to make riddles. Here, I have 
made a riddle:
We were part of the first com
petitive blitz booth experience. 
There is one day a year when all 
(or most) of our members remain 
silent.
If you guessed the Graduate 
Student Assembly, youre close 
but no cigar. Hello, my name is 
Joe Eliot DeGolia, vice president 
of ALLIES, and Im here to recruit 
you.
This year has been an exciting 
One to plan with October Pride 
Month events trickling into the 
calendar and organizing our up
coming events for Spirituality 
Month (November) and World 
AIDS Day on Dec. 1.
This Sunday, we are traveling to 
Washington D.C. for the National 
Equality March, where people 
from all over the country will be 
gathering to march in support 
of LGBT rights. Members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community will 
be joined by other Pittsburgh stu
dents and residents on our long 
bus trip. Tickets are still available, 
so contact allies@ if you are inter
ested in participating.
The day after, we are hosting 
events for Coming Out Day at the 
Fence and in Rangos. From 12-3 
p.m. at the Fence, ALLIES mem
bers will be discussing coming 
out stories and connecting with 
the campus. Then, beginning at 
6:30 p.m. in Rangos 2, we will be 
joined by GLENDA for a coming 
out social, where more members 
of Pittsburghs LGBT community 
will connect and show each other 
support.
Octobers keynote event is a 
screening of the local documenta
ry Out in the Silence, a story about 
how newspapers, like this one, 
can change the way people think. 
One of our newest initiatives this 
year has been a collaborative ef
fort with several Pittsburgh orga
nizations to endorse and utilize 
local LGBT resources.
In my third year of contribut
ing to campus organizations, I am 
always reminded of the necessity 
for a student organization to be 
multifaceted. Whenever I think 
of Carnegie Mellon, I think of di
versity. And often when I think of 
diversity, I think of many differ
ent kinds of people and organiza
tions. But it is also true that one 
individual or organization can be 
diverse in that it has many inter
ests and qualities. This is what I 
believe makes someone a mem
ber of Carnegie Mellons geekdom. And with my juggling act, I 
embrace it.
Bill'Gates, the richest man in the world, was recently on campus. So we asked,

Mens soccer sweeps Chicago 3-0
Volleyball suffers 3-2 loss to Geneva

Luck was not on the side of 
the Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team, which last week traveled 
to -local Geneva College but fell 
in five games 2-3. The Tartans 
record moves to 9-6 after this 
match.
The Tartans are currently in 
the midst of their University 
Athletic Association play, held in 
Rochester, N.Y.
The match momentum 
switched back and forth between 
the Tartans and the Tornadoes, 
with the Tornadoes grabbing 
the first game 19-25. The Tar
tans rebounded and took the 
second game 25-17 but dropped 
the third game at 22-25 after a 
tough back-and-forth battle. The 
Tartans won the next game by a 
hair (25-23) before falling in the 
tiebreak 10-15.
Leading the Tartans with kills 
were juniors Aislinn McCloskey 
and Caroline Size with 17 and 
15 wins, respectively. Seniors 
Jess Brackin and Megan Killeen 
added nine to the total, followed
File Photo
by senior Sam Carter, who, in 
addition to six kills, added 50 
assists and 14 digs. Junior Cam
eron Griffin kept the ball in play 
for the Tartans with a match 
high of 21 digs.
McCloskey, Size, and Killeen 
are currently the team leaders in 
kills, while Carter holds the title 
of most team assists and Griffin 
the record of most digs across all 
categories.
Killeen was optimistic about 
her teams future performance, 
and noted some observations 
for the past games. The game 
highlighted some of our weak
nesses, and over the next week 
and the course of the season we 
will work on remedying those. 
When playing Mount Union, 
every aspect of our game broke 
down slightlyour offense, our 
defense, even our communica
tion on the court was not where 
it usually is, she said. We have 
to work on maintaining all of 
these aspects of play even in 
high-stress situations.
The Tartans will host Thomas 
More College Oct. 11, with serv
ing set to begin at 2:30 p.m.
Character, not athleticism, makes biggest impact
LAUREN HIRATA
Junior Staffwriter
Almost everyone was forced to 
participate in a sport when they 
were a kid. I was one of those un
lucky  or luckykids. Whether 
it was ballet and tap lessons, club 
basketball, track, water polo, or 
swim team, my parents always 
supported my participation in 
athletics. While I complained 
about going to practice instead 
of being able to hang out with 
friends, participating in sports 
has had its benefits  namely, 
developing leadership skills.
As a child, I thought a leader 
was the loudest one on the field 
or the one with the best jump 
shot. But as an older and more 
mature athlete, Ive realized that 
leaders might not be designated
as captain; they might not even 
see playing time. There are dif
ferent types of leadership, and 
most of the time, the unassuming 
go unnoticed.
Carnegie Mellon athletics has 
taken note of this, and every 
year athletes attend the Lead
ership Symposium, led by Greg 
Shelley, associate professor of 
exercise and sport sciences at 
Ithaca College. Shelley has pub
lished articles and given presen
tations that show how to apply 
sports psychology to athletic 
performance, team building, 
and leadership.
At Carnegie Mellons Leader
ship Symposium, Shelley stresses 
the idea that leaders arent al
ways the ones who are being 
interviewed after the game. Behind-the-scenes leaders are just
as effective, usually leading by 
example.
Anyone who hasnt been liv
ing under a rock for the past two 
decades has heard of Michael 
Jordan. Hes known for his ridic
ulous jumping ability, his shoes, 
for helping the Looney Toons de
feat the aliens in Space Jam, and 
for leading the Chicago Bulls to 
six NBA championships. But have 
you ever heard of Josh Pastner? 
Probably not, because he wasnt 
the one on the Wheaties box. 
Despite the fact that his skills 
were less than his teammates  
players who went professional, 
including Mike Bibby and Miles 
Simon  it wasnt for his bas
ketball skills that his teammates 
called him a leader.
Pastner was a prime exam
ple of leading by example: He
showed an unrivaled dedica
tion to his team. He was the first 
one to practice and the. last one 
to leave. He was unselfish and 
cared less about his own skills, 
but more about improving the 
team as a whole.
Pastner didnt care if his team
mates didnt accept him as a 
walk-on at first, but he gained 
their respect with his work ethic, 
willingness to be a team player, 
and most importantly, his leader
ship.
Pastner, like most athletes, 
didnt go professional. However, 
the leadership skills and passion 
he showed for athletics landed 
him an assistant coaching job. 
Similarly, I know that I, like most 
athletes at Carnegie Mellon, 
wont go professional and, when 
it comes down to it, wont be re
membered for my athletic perfor
mance. But what Carnegie Mel
lon athletes will be remembered 
for is their leadership on and off 
of the field. The leadership skills 
I acquired while participating 
in athletics translate over to the 
classroom and probably into my 
professional life after school as 
well.
As a kid, I was naive in think
ing that the best leaders were the 
most popular, most talented, and 
maybe even the most self-righteous athletes.
But after 14 years of competi
tive sports, I have realized that I 
appreciate the athletes who are 
selfless, earn their respect, and 
lead by example. I know that I 
admire these types of athletes 
and, in turn, have tried to emu
late their good example.

lowed suit with 8-4 and 8-3 
victories to set up a semifinal 
showdown against their team
mates. Chin and Tam completed 
the day two dominance with 
8-1 and 8-6 victories.
Laura and I had a great year 
last year so we hoped we would 
have a good tournament to start 
this year, Herrick said. There 
were a lot of great doubles 
teams this year that made us 
work extra hard.
Carnegie Mellon continued to 
showcase its prowess on the fi
nal day of the tournament. Chen 
won her semifinals match over 
Hopkins Carolyn Warren, and 
Chin followed suit and nabbed 
another win 6-2, 6-2 to reach 
the finals as well. The resulting 
all Carnegie Mellon singles final 
was a showdown of intensity 
and skill; Chen triumphed over 
Chin 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (4) after a 
grueling two and a half hour 
match. Later that day, Chen 
teamed up with Herrick, and 
the duo beat their teammates 
Chui and Tapak 8-3 to advance 
to a tough finals match against a 
team from Johns Hopkins.
Chen and Herrick eventually 
won the marathon matchup 
6-2, 4-6, 10-8 to claim Carn
egie Mellons second title of the 
meet.
It feels great winning two 
[ITA] titles, Chen commented. 
Im excited for the [ITA] na
tionals that are coming up. It 
was great to see all Carnegie 
Mellon finals for both singles 
and doubles. I think its a good 
sign that our team is going to 
have a very good season. Per
sonally, for the spring season, 
I hope to continue playing well 
and maybe have a better record 
than last year. For the team, I 
would definitely like us to be 
able to go to the NCAAs again.
The spring looks hopeful 
for our team, Herrick added. 
We have a lot of great depth; it 
seems that everyone came back 
ready to compete and were all 
looking forward to seeing what 
we can do. I think the team as 
a whole has a great shot at win
ning the conference and doing 
some exciting things.
The team will ride their mo
mentum into a dual match at 
Oberlin on Saturday, Oct. 10 at
9 a.m.

Special to the Tartan
Welcome to the 21st cen
tury. The past 50 years have 
seen remarkable innovations in 
technology, medicine, and even 
physical fitness training. People 
are starting to understand the 
health benefits of proper daily 
physical activity. This could be 
due to the increase in lifestylerelated illness and pathologies. 
The latest data released by the 
Centers for Disease Control in 
2008 showed that every state 
but Colorado had a 20 percent 
or higher obesity rate. However, 
its easier than one might think 
to achieve a healthy lifestyle 
through physical activity.
The previous installment of 
Fiber Content emphasized 
static stretching  specifically, 
the increased health and perfor
mance that results. This article 
will focus on slightly more com
plex methods of stretching. Prop
rioceptive neuromuscular facili
tation (PNF) stretching has been 
a staple for high-level athletes for 
the past 30 years and has finally 
trickled down to the general fit
ness enthusiast.
Many experts consider PNF su
perior to other forms of stretch
ing because it facilitates muscu
lar inhibition. One of the main 
drawbacks to static stretching 
is the possibility of stretching 
an overactive muscle. When 
performing static stretching, 
opposing muscles (agonist and 
antagonist) may sometimes co
contract, not allowing for full 
relaxation of the muscle being 
stretched and yielding a less 
than optimal result. If done cor
rectly, PNF stretching eliminates 
this possibility.
During PNF stretching, three 
specific muscle actions are used 
to create the relaxed state and 
passive stretch. Concentric  ac
tive shortening of the muscle  
and ometric actions  prevent
ing the muscle from changing 
length  are performed on the 
antagonist muscle (the muscle 
being stretched) followed by a 
concentric contraction of the ag
onist (the muscle being trained, 
opposite the antagonist) to cause 
reciprocal inhibition.
Reciprocal inhibition is the 
bodys ability to allow one mus
cle group to relax so the other 
can contract fluidly. If this did 
not happen during normal move
ment, both the agonist and an
tagonist would contract simul
taneously, causing jerky, almost 
robot-like movements. During 
the stretching, the terms contract 
and hold are used to describe the 
concentric and isometric con
tractions, respectively. During 
the contraction of the agonist 
muscle, there is a passive static 
stretch applied, referred to as 
relax.
There are three basic tech
niques of PNF stretching used: 
hold-relax, contract-relax, and 
hold-relax with agonist contrac
tion. In performing all these 
exercises on the hamstring, for 
example, a long piece of sturdy 
rope or a lengthy belt will be 
needed. In all three examples, 
the rope or belt will be looped 
around the arch of the foot of 
the leg being stretched, and the 
person should be lying on the 
ground with enough rope or belt 
remaining to hold on to during 
the stretch. It is imperative dur
ing the stretch that the leg re
mains as straight as possible to 
ensure proper stretching of the 
full muscle. Each stretch has a 
starting position when the belt 
is used to apply just enough pres
sure that there is mild discom
fort, and this position is held for 
10 seconds  this static stretch 
allows the muscle to be relaxed.
Hold-Relax: Begin with the 
aforementioned starting po
sition. While maintaining a 
stretch, begin to pull slowly on 
the ropeto cause an increase
in tension while trying to hold 
the position of the leg, causing 
an isometric contraction of the 
antagonist (hamstring) muscle 
for six seconds. Lastly, relax and 
statically stretch the hamstring 
muscle group for 30 seconds, in
creasing the range of motion of 
the leg.
Contract-Relax: Begin once 
again with the starting stretch. 
While maintaining tension in 
the band, concentrically extend 
the leg down to the ground or 
through a full range of motion. 
Relax and passively bring the 
leg up to an increased range of 
motion by pulling on the belt 
and holding the hamstring in a 
relaxed and statically stretched 
state for 30 seconds.
Hold-Relax with Agonist 
Contraction: This technique
is identical to the hold-relax 
method mentioned above in the 
first two phases (relaxed and 
contract). Following the isomet
ric contraction of the hamstring 
muscles group, contract the 
quadriceps and hip flexor mus
cle groups by bringing the thigh 
closer to the body. Simultane
ously pull on the belt to increase 
the active range of motion.
With all three techniques, each 
subsequent relaxed static stretch 
should be at an increased range 
of motion. These techniques can 
be repeated anywhere from 2-3 
times on each limb. Perform only 
one of the three stretches per 
session and try to vary the tech
niques weekly to stay interested.
Like static stretching, these 
stretches can be performed be
fore, during, and after training 
sessions to promote increased 
flexibility, increased strength 
performance, and increased re
covery time.

quiries regarding both static and 
PNF stretching, the Internet is a 
great place to start. If you have

The Carnegie Mellon womens 
tennis team traveled to Freder
icksburg, Va. to compete in the 
Wilson ITA Southeast Regional 
from Sept. 26-28. The Tartans 
went into the tournament with 
three top-10 seeds in singles, and 
the doubles team of sophomore 
Laura Chen and junior Ashley 
Herrick seeded first in doubles; 
they left the tournament with 
Chen as the singles champion, 
sophomore Courtney Chin as 
the runner-up, and the team of 
Chen and Herrick as the doubles 
champions.
The Tartans entered the tour
nament with high hopes, with 
Chen seeded first overall in sin
gles, Chin seeded fifth, and firstyear Alex Tapak seeded ninth.

Chen won her first match 6-0, 
6-3 over the University of Mary 
Washingtons Jocelyn Lewis be
fore taking down Washington 
and Lees Ashley Leinweber 6-1, 
6-3. Chin also took her first two 
matches, defeating Washington 
Colleges Brittany Marshall and 
Swarthmores Emily Rosenblum, 
both by scores of 6-1, 6-1.
Tapaks first foray into ITA 
competition went well, as she 
also took both of her opening 
matches, winning 6-3,7-6 (7-2) 
over Washington and Lees Ann 
Morris before handling Kelly 
Fahmer of Salisbury University 
6-1,6-2. She would go on to win 
once more on day two before los
ing to Carolyn Warren of Johns 
Hopkins in the quarterfinals.
In doubles on day one, Chen 
and Herrick defeated Hopkins 
Ellen Berlinghof and Courtney
Boger 8-3 while junior Jen Chui 
and Tapak won 8-5 over Jackie 
Burr and Melissa Follet of Salis
bury. Senior Alisa Liebowitz and 
junior Kelly Hart also won their 
match 8-3, while Chin and soph
omore Cze-Ja Tam defeated their 
opponents 8-2.
Chen and Chin continued to 
roll in singles on the second day 
of the tournament. Chen won 
her round of 16 and quarterfinal 
matches 6-1,6-1 and 6-0,6-1 to 
make it to the semifinals, while 
Chin punched her ticket to semis 
with wins 6-1, 6-1 and 6-2,

Coming off of a victorious weekend at 
the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) 
Southeast Regional tournament, Carnegie 
Mellons womens tennis team is on track 
from their strong showing last season. Most 
notably, sophomore Laura Chen and junior 
Ashley Herrick brought back the doubles 
title and earned a trip to the ITA National 
Tournament later this month. Chen also 
garnered the singles title at the region
al tournament, although it was over 
sophomore teammate Courtney Chin.
Despite this, Chen, Herrick, and 
the rest of her fellow tennis players 
are extremely team-oriented and dis
play a positive relationship with one 
another, which is prevalent in their 
athletic, collegiate, and social 
endeavors.
A sophomore from Port 
Washington, N.Y., Chen is 
majoring in information sys
tems. Last season, Chen was 
named ITA National Rookie of the 
Year, and she seems to be living up 
to the title admirably. Chen chose 
Carnegie Mellon for its strong aca
demics that accompany her chance to 
play tennis, and she says, A student 
athlete is a student first. An avid fan 
of the Food Network, Chen concedes 
that one of the teams favorite tra
ditions is to eat their favorite foods 
together, whether it be to fuel up for a 
match or just to spend time together.
Herrick, a junior from Amherst,
Ohio majoring in psychology and biol
ogy, follows suit with the notion that 
both academics and athletics were driv
ing factors for her to attend Carnegie 
Mellon. The daughter of a tennis instruc
tor, Herrick was inspired by her mother 
to start tennis at the age of 6. She loves 
that the team is close-knit, citing their 
trip to Minnesota last season where they 
took the ITA Indoors National title as 
her most memorable event with the 
Tartans. Herrick emphasizes the value 
of the teams relationship: The close
ness of our team is what makes me 
love tennis so much.
By maintaining these tight friend
ships off the court, the Tartans tennis 
team is sure to continue their success 
on the clay.

Football defeats Kenyon 17-14 to complete three game road trip
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon football 
team completed its three-game 
road trip successfully on Satur
day with a 17-14 victory over Ke
nyon College. The win, the Tar
tans second in a row, put their 
record at 2-1 for the trip and 4-1 
for the season.
Although the Tartans would 
eventually spoil Kenyons home
coming celebrations with the vic
tory, it was the Lords who drew 
first blood. Carnegie Mellon 
started the game by returning 
the opening kickoff for 29 yards 
and driving another 29 yards 
before turning the ball over 
when junior running back Justin 
Pratt was stripped at the Kenyon 
6-yard line.
The Lords then completed an 
eight-play drive that ended with 
File Photo a 41-yard touchdown to put Ke
nyon up 7-0 with 10:25 to go in 
the quarter.
Carnegie Mellon senior quar
terback Socrates Zacharias was 
intercepted in the second quarter 
at the Kenyon 8-yard line, but ju
nior linebacker Mike Shedlosky 
then stripped Kenyons Mike Hermanson, and senior Josh Kresge 
recovered the fumble at the Ke
nyons 28-yard line. The Tartans 
ensuing drive resulted in Pratt 
scoring on a 1-yard touchdown 
run to knot the score at 7 with 
12:12 to go in the half. Shedlosky 
wound up with nine tackles in 
the game.
Carnegie Mellon sophomore 
Ray Johnson had a 55-yard fum
ble return later in the quarter, 
but the team turned the ball over 
at the Kenyon 30-yard line. The 
Tartans managed to take the lead 
in the third quarter after taking 
advantage of a Kenyon missed 
field goal. After the Lords Harry
von Kanns 23-yard attempt went 
wide, the Tartans executed a 14- 
play, 71-yard drive, leading to a 
26-yard field goal by junior place 
kicker Elliot Carnevale and a 
10-7 Tartan lead. The lead was 
short-lived, however, as Kenyon 
followed with a 75-yard drive of 
their own and a touchdown to 
take back the lead, 14-10.
Carnegie Mellon was not to 
be deterred, and first-year Dave 
Biersen returned the kickoff for a 
65-yard run to Kenyons 18-yard 
line.
Pratt ended the ensuing sixplay drive with a 2-yard run for 
what would prove to be the win
ning touchdown, putting the car
dinal and gray up 17-14. Pratt 
finished the day with two touch
downs and 68 yards.
The team played very inspired 
and came away with a hardfought win, head coach Rich 
Lackner said. Our offensive line
came up with a very critical drive 
in the fourth quarter.
There was still a lot of game 
left to play after scoring that fi
nal touchdown, however, and 
the Tartans made sure that the 
Lords didnt pose any threat to 
regain the lead.
After keeping Kenyon con
tained in two separate minutelong drives, the Tartans came up 
big time with a 17-play drive that 
took seven minutes off the game 
clock, giving Kenyon only 1:06 to 
garner a comeback.
We moved the ball well all 
day, Lackner said. But the big
gest drive of the game was the 
last one, which took up about 7 
minutes and gave Kenyon the 
ball back with very little time 
left.
The football team will play at 
home in Gesling Stadium this 
Saturday against Allegheny Col
lege, with kickoff set for 1 pjji.
Womens soccer beats Grove City 3-2, ties with #15 Chicago 1-1
2-1.
Unfortunately, Grove City fired 
back with a goal of their own in 
the last few minutes of the game, 
which brought the score to a nailbiting 2-2, and the game transi
tioned into overtime. At 3:47 
after overtime started, first-year 
Lissie Arndt kicked the ball to the 
left corner of the box, where it 
was received by Wu. With a swift 
kick in a tension-filled stadium, 
Wu scored, ending the game at 
3-2.
Wus performance during this 
match was exceptional, as this 
was her first hat trick of her soc
cer career. With this win, the 
Tartans record rose to 4-4 for 
the season.
That following Saturday, the 
Tartans played at home in Ges
ling Stadium against the Ma
roons. The first goal of the game 
was nearly scored by Carnegie 
Mellons own junior Val Corvino, 
but her shot was blocked at the 
six-yard line. A minute later,
Chicago scored a goal of their 
own, improving their score to 
0-1. The excitement of the game 
continued during the second 
half, when Chicago attempted to 
score again 67 minutes into the 
game but was intercepted by ju
nior Emily Overstreet. Just two 
minutes later, Overstreet made 
a corner kick to first-year Katie 
Davis, who in turn went for the 
goal, but that was saved again 
by Chicago. With 3:37 left in the 
second half, Overstreet passed a 
corner kick to junior Alice May
field, who scored on a header, ty
ing the game.
The match continued into 
overtime, where Mayfield took 
another shot at the goal but was 
then blocked by the Maroons 
goalie. Next, Chicago attempted 
to make a goal of their own, which 
was luckily saved by the Tartans 
junior keeper Anya Rosen. The 
action continued two minutes 
later when Tartans sophomore 
Elsa Wu and  another two min
utes following  Mayfield each 
nearly scored yet another goal, 
which were once again blocked 
by Chicagos goalie. This shutout 
sent the game into a second over
time period. In the last minute 
of the game, Chicago attempted 
to make two corner kicks, but 
the Tartans defenses were too 
strong, and both were blocked. 
The game ended in a tie, with a 
final score of 1-1.
This game was a morale-boost
ing indicator for the Tartans, and 
forecasts positive results in the 
next few weeks. It was a great 
performance against Chicago 
and a much-needed tie, com
mented Overstreet. Playing so 
well in our first UAA [University 
Athletic Association] game was 
extremely important and hope
fully leads to a strong UAA sea
son.
The Tartans will hit the field 
next on Oct. 7 against Union Col
lege in Alliance, Ohio with kickoff set to start at 7 p.m.

From game board to Google Maps
Popular tycoon toy expands to Web 2.0
Everything you need to know
About cheating on homework and relationships
Wall Street. Whitehall. Bourbon Street. Sunset 
Boulevard. Pennsylvania Avenue.
Property magnates like Donald Trump can only 
dream of owning all of these iconic spaces. Of 
course, the same property magnates probably 
wouldn't choose to construct a sewage treatment 
plant on the National Mall or a power plant at 10 
Downing St., but with the new Monopoly City 
Streets (www.monopolycitystreets.com), all these 
things, and many more, have already happened 
on properties worldwide.
Monopoly City Streets, which went live on Sept.
9, brings the greed and scheming of the classic 
Monopoly to a new level. In order to promote 
the newest edition of this board game, the 
producer of the game, Hasbro, has leveraged the 
scalability of Web 2.0. Anybody who has wasted 
hours exploring the world using Google Maps
can understand the appeal of being able to own 
property on any street on Earth.
Celia Ludwinski | Assistant Photo Editor
The few weeks since Monopoly City Streets 
launched have not been without the usual 
problems faced by online services, however. 
According to the official blog, the site recorded 
over 1.7 million unique visitors on its first day, 
which quickly overloaded the servers. Since then, 
the game has expanded its capacity and is now 
operating more smoothly. The first few weeks 
of service were rife with glitches and bugs, but 
Hasbro engineers have now addressed most 
of these issues. A complete game reset took 
place a week after the release to prevent unfair 
advantages due to early bugs. As with the classic 
game of Monopoly, though, cheating players 
have been a problem since the game's launch.
While cheaters in a board game are fairly obvious 
and easily dealt with, cheaters online can be 
more difficult to catch and have far-reaching 
consequences. Players using multiple accounts
can take advantage of more starting funds, which 
allows them to control more property  imagine 
being able to start with $30,000 instead of the 
usual $1500 in the board game. More money in 
the game also causes inflation, which means 
normal players have a harder time finding 
. property at reasonable prices. <
Game play in Monopoly City Streets is 
straightforward. Starting with $3 million, players 
try to find streets to buy. According to the 
official FAQ, all streets in the OpenStreetMap 
database are available, which allows for a lot of 
choices. After buying streets, players'have the 
option of using their remaining funds to build 
on those streetsPossible options include the 
frugal Green House, costing $50,000 and giving 
$8000 daily Tent, all the way up to the "Monopoly 
Tower, which costs an impressive $100 million 
and yields $850,000 in daily rent. Earning money 
in City Streets is deterministic: A certain rent 
is paid daily based on the number and type of 
buildings owned, provided a player logs in on 
that day. After two weeks of inactivity, the bank 
repossesses all properties. As with any Monopoly 
game, Chance cards appear from time to time, 
in this case at random intervals. These cards 
might add or detract from a players balance, or 
they might allow the construction of a special 
building, such as a stadium or power plant.
Other Chance cards contain codes for discounted 
purchases on Hasbro's online store.
At its heart, Monopoly City Streets is still a 
marketing tool, and is not enough to displace 
the popular World of Waicraft. The initial appeal 
of being able to buy the street where one grew 
up does not last for more than a few days, and 
most major streets are already taken and require 
a large sum to buy, so owning Forbes Avenue 
will be out of most peoples price range. The 
deterministic nature of rent payments detracts 
from the games excitement. The Monopoly 
board game is fun because of the luck involved; 
one can win or lose on a single roll of the dice.
In the online version, players can try to buy 
properties from other players and use special 
buildings to sabotage their opponents, but often 
the people on each side of this transaction will 
only know the other's username.
While Monopoly City Streets will not replace the ' 
classic fun of the board game or the city-building 
strategy of games like SimCity, it displays 
great creativity on the part of its designers.
The breadth of information freely available on 
the Internet means that this will not be the last 
attempt at integrating classic games with novel 
technology.

Dear Prerna,
I am a first-year computer 
science major and I have a lot 
of work to do, but, like every 
other student, I want to do well 
in school and still have a great 
time. For my programming class,
I had an assignment that I knew 
would take me a while to crack.
I had initially intended to stay in 
that night while my friends went 
out, but while I was about to 
begin, I happened to see that my 
roommate had left his homework 
assignment finished and open 
on his computer. I sneakily 
e-mailed his assignment to my 
computer and used his solution 
as an outline for mine, and so I 
was able to finish my homework 
quickly and go out with my 
friends. However, now I feel 
guilty about my actions. What 
should I do?
 Guilty Roommate
Dear Guilty Roommate,
College is a place where you will 
make several choices  some good, 
others bad. However, you need to 
be aware of the repercussions of 
your actions at all times. Parties 
and other fun opportunities will 
come and go, but it is up to you to 
make the better choice. Sometimes, 
people forget that they are in college 
to study and build a future for 
themselves, yet each one of us has 
our weak moments, so don't beat 
yourself up over it.
My suggestion would be to speak to 
your roommate and own up to your 
mistake. Since he is your roommate, 
chances are that he might help you 
understand the homework better the 
next time, not get you into trouble, 
and be supportive  of course, 
this depends on your relationship 
with your roommate. There are 
other places on campus where you 
can find help, too, like Academic 
Development, which offers tutoring 
services. Start working on your own 
homework assignments early; it will 
only benefit you.
Good Luck,
Dear Prerna,
I am starting to develop 
feelings for this girl I just got 
to know. Shes great, funny, 
and gorgeous. However, there 
is a slight problem  her 
football-playing boyfriend. In my 
defense, she flirts with me and 
treats me specially. I dont know 
what to do. Should I confess my 
feelings to her and sabotage her 
relationship or simply suppress 
my growing feelings?
 The Better Bet 
Dear Better,
Wow, youve gotten yourself into 
quite the situation here, and with 
a footballers girlfriend. Firstly, I 
suggest you find out whether her 
feelings toward you are romantic 
or if shes just being a great friend. 
Some girls also have the tendency 
to be extra friendly with boys just to 
make their boyfriend jealous.
My recommendation would be to 
awaken that tough football player
like attitude within you and go speak 
to her. Tell her how you feel and ask 
her how she feels. If she says she 
likes you or is interested, I think 
your road is pretty easy from there. 
If she is confused, then be there 
for her, and support her decision. 
If she is using you, or is simply not 
interested, then youre just wasting 
your time  there are many other 
fish in the sea. Speak to her directly 
and confidently, and if youre afraid 
her boyfriend might beat you up, 
come to me, and Ill teach you how 
to throw a couple of solid punches.
Man it up!

Tales from abroad: Morocco
Bargaining in Rabat, touring Marrakesh, and crafting wood in Essaouira
Last summer, I traveled to Rabat, Morocco to take part In 
the SIT Morocco Intensive Language and Culture Program. 
The program consisted of several parts: cultural experiences, 
excursions, lectures, Arabic class, and home stay. The goal 
of the study abroad program was to provide an eight-week 
introduction to Moroccan culture and standard Arabic, and 
this was achieved through cultural immersion and weekend 
trips intended to explore Moroccos vibrant culture. The 
language component of the program was rigorous and 
consisted of an introductory language class. The cultural 
component also had an introductory cultural class, and all 
these classes had a course load of nine to 13 units. Both 
classes included participatory roles and field trips to help 
enhance the learning experience. In addition to learning 
Arabic in the classrooms, the program also offered eight 
weeks of language and cultural practice in the city of Rabat.
Classes were held every day (including Saturday during the 
first two weeks) for three hours. I learned the alphabet in 
one day and spent more time practicing it and learning how 
to write the script and the exceptions in connecting Arabic 
letters. The instructor of the course did not speak English, 
so body language and the translations from the two French 
speakers in the class were my only form of communication. 
But as the class progressed, she began to communicate with 
me using simple grammar and vocabulary words with which I 
was familiar.
The streets of Rabat proved to be my biggest learning ground 
during my time there, and I saw, heard, and learned how life 
in Morocco operated. For instance, crossing the streets is a 
gradual process, and one does not typically wait for the lights 
to change. Shortly after arrival, I had difficulty crossing the 
streets and walking in the streets due to my fear of bumping 
into people. As my stay progressed, I noticed that the natives 
stopped in the middle of the street and even bumped into 
each other, and this made me begin to feel more and more 
comfortable walking.
The program included an introduction to bargaining in which 
I was given 10 dirhams and asked to shop in the market. In an 
effort to make up for my lack of language ability, I motioned 
to the shopkeepers to write the price. As I became more 
conversational in Arabic, I would greet the shopkeepers
in Arabic and have conversations with them. I learned the 
games that they play as well: The first price is always a teaser 
price, which they do not expect to be paid. I remember an 
instance when I went with a friend to buy a soccer jersey.
The shopkeeper said the price was 100 dirhams, but before 
I began serious negotiations, he lowered the price to 90 
dirhams. Not all shopkeepers bargain, however: Shopkeepers 
that sell toiletries are very friendly but have fixed prices.
The objective of the excursions during the program was to 
show different parts of Morocco to the participants in order to 
allow them to develop a better understanding of the culture. 
There were two excursions: the first was to Marrakesh and 
Essaouira in the south, and the second was to Fez and a 
village called Briksha in the north.
At Marrakesh, I visited the mansion of a former slave built 
by his previous master. The temperature during my stay 
was quite high at around 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Overall, 
Marrakesh was not a very welcoming city, and having lived 
in Rabat, the amount of tourism and the way locals were 
primed to sell to foreigners was not appealing to me. When I 
arrived at Essaouira, the annual Gunawa music festival was in 
session. The music festival included various genres of music 
and gave me a view into the music of southern Morocco, 
which is similar to sub-Saharan African music. At Essaouira, I 
got a chance to see how woodworks are crafted and was even 
able to try and make part of a piece.
The northern excursion to Fez included a visit to the medina, 
which is Arabic for city, specifically the walled parts of the 
city. Being in the medina was like being transported in time. 
There were no bikes or cars, and only donkeys and horses 
were used to transport goods. As part of the tour, I visited a 
tannery that used traditional methods of dying leather.
During my time in Morocco, I had the opportunity to live with 
a family in the medina of Rabat. The houses are built in an 
Andalusian style  a square design with a large open hole in 
the center. My family was made up of six members: a father, 
mother, two sisters, and two brothers. Dinners were eaten late
 around 11 p.m. or midnight  and the family always ate 
together. The family ate from a single large plate and bread 
was used as a spoon. On Friday, we always ate couscous for
lunch, and in an attempt to make me eat more, food would 
always be pushed to my side of the plate and I would be told 
to "kull"  meaning eat in Darija, Morroccos dialect of 
Arabic.
Unfortunately, my home stay mother was very sick, and I 
believed it would be best if the family focused on her rather 
than on me. After much contemplation, I went through with 
a switch and moved into a new family's house. The first night 
with my new family was rough, as I kept thinking about the 
decision and its possible impacts. After the change, I visited 
my first home stay mother often to see how she was doing, 
and I would typically meet members of her family on the 
streets.
My new family was made up of a father, a mother, and three 
sons. The new family gave me an opportunity to validate 
some of my cultural observations. I noticed that shay  
Moroccan tea, which is mint tea with a lot of sugar  is a 
staple and is served in all homes. Based on the activities of my 
previous family, I had assumed that most Moroccans did not 
pray frequently, but my new family prayed a lot and were a lot 
more religious in general. This realization gave me a better 
understanding of Islam and its various levels of participation.
The power of language became apparent to me during 
my time in Morocco. Though I entered the country with 
practically no French or Arabic experience, I was able to 
communicate within the first three weeks of my stay. Using 
body language and the words I had learned, I was able to 
confidently order coffee from a coffee shop and communicate 
where I was going to my host family.
Apart from the language skills, cultural awareness, and 
understanding, I also learned that other ways of life are 
possible and do exist. After living in the same Britishdominated systems for such a long time, it becomes easy 
for one to forget that other ways of living are viable. This 
reawakening enabled me to expand and challenge myself to 
think in new and different ways.

Ideas, waffles make tasty contest
Competitors present ingenious concepts for the future
Imagination, utopian societies, and waffles made last 
Saturday night an excellent creative combination. 
Visionary Ideas for this World or Another, an event 
sponsored by the Waffle Shop, a Carnegie Mellon art 
project, was a satellite event for the Miller Gallerys 
current exhibit 29 Chains to the Moon.
In the gallery exhibit, artists display innovative design 
ideas that envision a better future for humanity. The 
Visionary Ideas event used this same concept, but the 
contestants displayed their ideas for the future through 
presentations, and the person who presented the best 
idea was awarded a years supply of waffles and a $250 
cash prize, as well as the opportunity to have his or her 
vision broadcast to the cosmos.
...listening to Mozart would 
power a toaster and dancing 
in the kitchen would turn on 
the lights.
At 9 p.m. at the East Liberty Presbyterian Church, eight 
contestants with very different outlooks on life gathered 
to present their perspectives on how to better the future 
of humanity. Each had five minutes to explain their 
vision and then two minutes to answer questions from 
the three judges. An impressive-looking organ provided 
atmospheric music, playing a series of intimidating 
chords when a contestants time was up.
Ken Binsley and Less Jangley also addressed the issue of 
communication in their presentation, which embodied 
many a music-lovers most cherished dream: to replace 
normal speech with song. This, they claimed, would 
reduce the spending of individuals and government on 
health care and would advance the cause of interspecies 
and extraterrestrial communication. Plus, making every 
day 42nd Street Day would undoubtedly brighten the 
lives of many.
Oscar Peters described his theory of Accelerated 
De-evolution, in which people, though keeping their 
minds intact, would devolve more and more with each 
generation, so that a family portrait five generations from 
now would include some Homo sapiens, but also some 
chimps, a Neanderthal, amphibians, and other members 
of our inauspicious beginnings.
Vanessa German drew upon the power of the human 
mind in her vision of the future, which was titled The 
Power of Imagination. Pointing out that it is scientifically 
proven that human minds are at their most energetic 
when creating something, she proposed a society in 
which imagination is literally used to power life  
listening to Mozart would power a toaster and dancing in 
the kitchen would turn on the lights.
Contestants had varying beliefs as to why their own 
innovations were the best. Contestant Gregg Pangle, who 
sported a Salvador Dali-esque mustache that disappeared 
by the end of his performance, explained why he wanted 
to fill the world with clones of himself in simple terms: 
Because Im a genius
The youngest innovators were Alex Korzeniwsky and 
Avalon Perdriel-Arons, fifth graders at the Waldorf School 
of Pittsburgh who presented their idea for a "Gel House. 
Together, they described a house that would build itself, 
growing in size until it was told to stop. It would supply 
its own heat and lights and decorate itself according to 
its inhabitants' moods.
After the presentations were completed, audience 
members voted for the winner. The runners-up were 
Pangle, Korzeniwsky and Perdriel-Arons, and the winner 
was German, who mamboed her way to the stage to be 
wreathed in two flowering laurels and carried out of the 
church in a chair, heralded by organ music and cheers 
from the audience.
When asked how she felt about her victory, German 
poetically referred to both her personal experience and to 
her ride out of the church on a chair. You will rise, hot on 
your own, but on the shoulders of others, she said. After 
the event, judges, contestants, and audience members 
met at the Waffle Shop to partake in some delicious 
midnight waffles.
The judging table was composed of Janera Solomon, 
the executive director of the Kefly-Strayhorn Theater;'
Bill Peduto, a Pittsburgh City Councilman; and Renee 
Piechocki, an artist and the director of the Office for 
Public Arts of Pittsburgh.
"Well, I knew it would be diverse and creative and 
compelling, and thats what happened tonight. [The 
Waffle Shop is] a wonderful example of the artist being a 
civic engagement instigator, Piechocki responded after 
some thought.
The event was filled with creative and mind-blowing 
ideas, which kept the audience laughing and caused 
them to truly think. All in all, it showed newcomers and 
reminded old customers what the Waffle Shop project is 
all about.

E%aiPaperhouserattrontiMOn culture in the Burgh
A couple weeks back, I was hyping Eugene Onegin, a performance 
that showed at the Pittsburgh Opera House through Oct. 4.
I was lucky enough to catch it last Tuesday (no small feat considering my 
schedule nowadays), and watching it, I realized just how far Pittsburgh 
has come. Pittsburgh was  and still is  thought of as a workingclass, hard-times town, complete with bad air, broken factories, and 
the like; not necessarily the place youd expect to find great opera, 
dance, classical music, or other high culture things.
But with the Pittsburgh Symphony, Pittsburgh Opera, and other worldclass cultural institutions, its a great time for the arts in Pittsburgh.
With the economic rebound comes a greater rebound in culture, and 
the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, along with smaller arts institutions, has 
been a major part of this rebound.
Not only do we get the popular musicians of the day, but we have 
a wide variety of international artists coming through. Just this past 
March, Portuguese superstar Mariza was at the Benedum Center, part 
of a line of artists brought to the Byham Theater.
Starring in Onegin was Anna Samuil, a rising Russian opera star, 
along with Dwayne Croft and Suzanne Mentzer, both mainstays at the 
Metropolitan Opera in New York City.
The Pittsburgh Symphony has a world-renowned conductor in Austrian 
Manfred Honeck, and its Pops wing has the great Marvin Hamlisch, 
one of only two people to have won an Emmy, an Oscar, a Grammy, a 
Tony, a Golden Globe Award, and a Pulitzer Prize.
Broadway musicals routinely come through Pittsburgh on tour, with 
performances of Rent and Fiddler on the Roof featuring original cast 
members headlining shows in recent months.
Pittsburgh has also been the host of a dancing explosion, with many 
new experimental and modem dance troupes springing up.
So go out, see a show, catch a concert, or watch a dance performance, 
and remind yourself how lucky you are to be going to school in a city 
that is blossoming culturally.

Sugar, cream cheese, raisins create delicious dessert
Bake some warm, creamy cheesecake to sate your sweet tooth during these winter months
There are different types of recipes  some that train us on 
specific techniques, some that take us on exotic adventures, 
and others that inspire us to put a new spin on the recipe.
For me, making this cheesecake lets me take a break 
from whatever is going on. The recipe requires minimal 
preparation with a good balance of technique, but it is not so 
complicated that I am overwhelmed when I am making it on 
a bad day.
Generously butter a 9-inch Springform pan. It helps to cut a 
piece of parchment paper for the bottom of the pan for easier 
pan-to-plate transfer when serving. If you try this, make sure 
you also butter the parchment paper. In the case that you do 
not have a Springform pan, you can use a regular baking pan, 
but definitely line your pan with parchment paper.>s _ ' ,
Ingredients for the crust (measure everything out and chill 
it in the fridge while you make other preparations):
Three-fourths cup all-purpose flour
One-fourth cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, chilled
3 teaspoons granulated sugar 
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ice-cold water
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
For the crust, put all the ingredients, except for water, 
together in a bowl. Every ingredient must be cold, because 
you dont want to melt the butter in the process. With a fork, 
or a pastry knife if you have one, mash in the butter and the 
other ingredients until the mix resembles moist sand.
Add half a tablespoon of ice-cold water at a time and keep 
mashing the crust mixture. You are looking for a large lump 
that still retains a moist, sandy resemblance, not a paste.
Dump the crust mixture into the pan, and with a glass 
covered from the outside in cling wrap, pat the mixture evenly 
over the pan. I find that its best to start with the glass and 
then finish patting with your hand. You dont have to worry 
about making the crust perfectly even, as it will be covered 
with cheesecake mixture.
Once the crust is even, use a fork to poke the crust all over, 
leaving around a quarter inch to an inch between each poke.
Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove.
Cool the pan on a rack, or by the window if the weather is 
cool, before starting to mix the cheesecake batter. You want 
the batter and the crust to be at the same temperature so 
that the batter will be cooked evenly and gently. If you use a 
Springform pan, wrap the bottom of the pan with aluminum 
foil, as the pan tends to leak.
Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Ingredients for the cheesecake:
2 packs of regular cream cheese, room temperature
1.5 cups granulated sugar 
1 cup yogurt, the regular packaged cup
5 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
One-half cup of raisins, cranberry, or any dried fruit of 
preference. Chocolate chips are optional.
Soften the cream cheese with an electric 
mixer at medium speed; then cream it 
with sugar. Creaming is a process in 
which sugar is slowly added to softened 
cream cheese or butter. The two are then 
mixed together for about five to seven
minutes at medium speed until light and fluffy. This process 
incorporates little air bubbles into the batter, and as the cake 
is baked, the air bubbles expand and elevate the cake.
Add the yogurt. I have never tried flavored yogurt, but 
attempt it if you dare. Make sure you mix it thoroughly.
Add one egg at a time while beating the mixture at medium 
speed. Mix well before adding another egg. After the third 
egg, I usually stop and use a rubber spatula to scrape down 
the entire bowl to ensure the ingredients have mixed well. I 
repeat this process again after the fifth egg. Add the vanilla 
extract and mix for another five to 10 seconds.
Pour the cheesecake mixture into the pan. If you want to 
put in any dried fruit or chocolate, drop them into the cake 
after youve poured the mix in. As a safety precaution, I 
generally put the cake pan over a larger rimmed baking 
pan. This makes sure that if theres any leaking, the oven is 
protected.
After 50 minutes of baking, gently tap the pan with a wooden 
spoon. The middle of the cake should still jiggle a little bit like 
uncooked egg. With the center slightly uncooked, turn off the 
oven and leave the oven door partially open. This way, the 
cake cools slowly and continues to cook even after the oven 
is turned off. Slowly cooling the cake prevents cracking of the 
cake and, hopefully, youll get a smooth cheesecake.
You can also bake cheesecake in a warm water bath by 
placing the cheesecake pan in water in another bigger pan. 
Cover the cake pan with several sheets of aluminum foil to 
ensure no leaks. The water bath allows the cheesecake to 
cook at a gentler temperature.
Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least four hours before 
serving or keep it in the fridge overnight.
If you dont have a Springform pan, run a small knife under 
hot water, pat it dry, and gently run it around the perimeter of 
the pan. Using a plate that is slightly smaller than the pan and 
covered in cling wrap, invert the cheesecake out of the pan; 
be careful, as the cake is very soft.
This is a cook-friendly recipe, as the ingredients require a 
minimum amount of measuring. The cream cheese, eggs, and 
yogurt akeady come in fixed quantities, and all that needs 
to be measured is the sugar and a little bit of flour. After all, 
you can practically eyeball the amount of vanilla extract and 
raisins. With cooler weather and closed windows, baking 
this cake will fill your room with the delicious smell of sugar, 
vanilla, and cheesecake.

Sushi, sashimi, and mochi-, best in Pittsburgh
Campus sushi will never be enough after you taste some from Chaya
Just the way everyone has a favorite burger place or coffee 
spot, they also seem to have a different opinion on which is 
the best sushi restaurant. Pittsburgh, being the land-locked 
city that it is, doesn't give too many options to choose from, 
and most students either settle for the boxed sushi available 
on campus or go'without it, not knowing that one of the citys 
best places, Chaya, is right up the street.
The nondescript windows facing out onto Murray Avenue 
leave this place known only to people who have sought the 
best sushi in Pittsburgh. A small restaurant, Chaya is barely 
able to hold 30 or so people and is packed on most nights of 
the week. The restaurant is warm and cozy, and the servers 
are quick to get the drinks while customers decide on their 
main course.
The menu is extensive, with traditional Japanese fare from 
appetizers to tempura to teriyaki to fish, ending with mochi 
for dessert. The sushi and sashimi menu is equally long and 
has a lot of variety. Beginning with appetizers, gyoza is a 
great place to start. This dish consists of pork and cabbage 
dumplings that are perfectly pan-fried, leaving just enough 
moisture to offset the crisp outside. Seaweed salad is a unique 
twist on the traditional garden salad and the grated seaweed 
leaves have much more texture than taste.
While ordering sushi, there are two ways to go about doing it. 
One can either get a combination platter or order from the a la 
carte menu. There are many different platters to choose from: 
deluxe and regular platters, as well as fish-specific platters to

Chaya ships its fish fresh from New York and Japan, 
ensuring the best taste for its customers.
suit all desires. One of the favorites is the sushi boat, and it is 
recommended that at least three people share this dish. The 
tuna at Chaya is renowned for its flavor and tenderness, and 
it only takes one bite of the fish to realize that this is as fresh 
as fish gets in Pittsburgh and that it is really good. For a little 
kick, opt for the spicy tuna. To make it hot, a mayonnaise and 
chili pepper mix is daubed on the fish, adding just the right 
amount of spice to make this one of Chaya's top orders.
The shrimp tempura roll is a combination of a piece of shrimp 
tempura, rolled in traditional sticky rice and covered in an 
addicting eel sauce. The shrimp is covered in batter and
cooked to a golden hue, giving the roll a crispy texture, while 
the sweet eel sauce plays off the shrimp flavor, leaving the 
mouth watering for more.
Other notable rolls are the cucumber roll, California roll, and 
salmon roll. The cucumber roll is crunchy, and the cucumber 
slices are refreshing, so this choice is available for vegetarians 
or those who want some variety. The California roll is the 
standard starter sushi, and Chaya makes this combination 
of crab, cucumber, avocado, and fish egg well. Finally, the 
salmon roll, much like the tuna, is full of flavor. The salmon is 
easy to chew and goes well with a dab of soy sauce.
An important thing that one can tell from the sushi at Chaya 
is that it is fresh. Fumio Yasuzawa, the executive chef and 
owner of Chaya, ships his fish in from Japan and New York.
He has a rule that fish should never be frozen but chilled on 
ice until served at the restaurant. Since the restaurant opened 
in 2001, word has gotten out about this place and there is 
usually a line waiting for a table. Surprisingly, the prices at 
the restaurant are quite affordable. Regular rolls cost no more 
than $5, and it is reasonable to expect to spend under $30 for 
a dinner for two. This is an unbeatable value for this quality of 
sushi.

The Girlfriend Experience is an 
interesting take on a drama. It follows 
the story of Chelsea, a call girl, in the 
days leading up to the Presidential 
election as she tries to balance her 
boyfriend, clients, and work. One of 
the more entertaining aspects of the 
film revolves around Chelseas highend clients, who spend thousands 
to be with her, yet she constantly 
worries about the economic climate. 
The film is an original, visually 
stunning, and crafty take on a wellworn topic that deserves a chance. 
Fun Fact: Chelsea is played by 
pornographic film actress Sasha Grey 
in her feature film debut  well, nonX-rated debut.

Well, you know what they say: Fool

Indeed, this is a fine movie, so despite 
the fact that the striptease may not be all

 otherwise known as anything you 
could want from a movie. In the flick, 
we follow a group of misfits who

Bringing the world to a campus near you
China, India, and Germany celebrate the coming of autumn with cultural staples and iconic dances \
\
J by Meela Dudley | Assistant Pillbox Editor J 
J by Shweta Suresh | Pillbox Editor jj
This past week, Carnegie Mellon witnessed a plethora of 
cultural holidays from all over the globe. Students were able 
to celebrate the start of a new, colder season in their own 
traditional ways.
Mid-Autumn Festival
Last weekend, students gathered together to celebrate the 
Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon 
Festival, in the University Center.
The Mid-Autumn Festival is usually held in late September 
or early October, on the 15th day of the eighth month in 
the Chinese calendar. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and 
Korean cultures all celebrate this popular harvest festival 
in their own ways. It is one of the most important holidays 
on the Chinese calendar and marks the end of the summer 
harvesting season.
Apart from being a harvest festival, this celebration also has 
a history of legend and myth surrounding it. The Chinese 
relate this day to the one on which a young girl, Change, was 
lifted from the Earth and placed onto the moon. This story of 
how her fate came to be has many different versions and is 
a favorite among Chinese poets. Another legend associated 
with the moon is that of the Jade Rabbit. The Jade Rabbit is 
supposed to reside on the moon with Change, and this myth 
seems to have sprung from the fact that the dark spots on the 
moon resemble the form of a rabbit.
Some traditional practices are used when celebrating the 
Mid-Autumn Festival. Festival-goers indulge in delicious 
mooncakes  called yuebing in Mandarin  and pomelos, 
citrus fruits native to Southeast Asia. Popular Chinese 
mooncakes are small, rectangular, or circular, mildly sweet 
pastries that are filled with a moist lotus seed paste and 
surrounded by a thin crust that is made from the yolks of 
salted duck eggs. Parties are decorated with floating sky 
lanterns, autumn flowers, and traditional Asian dragon 
displays. People come together to celebrate the spring 
equinox and witness the moon at its biggest and brightest. 
While there are many ways of celebrating, the Asian 
communities are unified in their recognition of the holiday.
In Korea," Jeongyoon Yu, an undecided first-year in H&SS, 
said, the concept of the Mid-Autumn Festival is much like 
the American Thanksgiving. Instead of the Chinese and 
Japanese mooncake, however, [Koreans] all gather together in 
our traditional clothes and make a large honey rice cake to be 
shared by the entire family.
Last Friday, students at Carnegie Mellon University also 
celebrated the end of the summer harvest season in their own 
special way. Students gathered at the University Center for 
music, dancing, traditional Asian cuisine, and socializing.
The party acted not only as a traditional Mid-Autumn Festival 
celebration, but also signified the start of a new academic 
season: fall.
What I liked best about the festival," Jing Jing Li, an 
undecided first year in H&SS, said, was how inclusive it was. 
I didnt feel as if any culture was excluded. It really was an 
all-Asian celebration.

Oktoberfest
Students were also given a glimpse into the German 
Oktoberfest in the Schatz Dining Room on Sept. 24 when the 
kitchen staff served up some traditional German cuisine.
Oktoberfest is a 16-day festival held in Munich, Germany 
every year. It is one of the largest world celebrations, 
attracting some six million people every year.
Michael Kahn | Copy Manager
It is safe to say that food and drink are huge components 
of Oktoberfest. During celebration, visitors dress up in 
traditional garb and eat vast amounts of traditional German 
food, including pork, sausage, chicken, pretzels, potatoes, 
pancakes, and dumplings.
But more than food, this German festival is about the great 
German beer. Oktoberfest is known for its giant beer mugs
 steins  and almost endless supply of beer, and people 
from all over the country and world flock to Munich to enjoy 
some of the alcohol during this time.
The original Oktoberfest began in 1810 when the Crown 
Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen 
celebrated their marriage. In 1819, Munich took responsibility 
for the festival and agreed that it would be celebrated every 
year without exception.
Reviews of the quality of food at the Schatz Oktoberfest 
varied, but overall students found the idea of a traditional 
German celebration on campus to be exciting and 
internationally interesting.
I love it when campus recognizes international holidays," Li 
said. It allows students to experience the world right here on 
campus.

Dussehra and Diwali
Celebrations during this time are not restricted to East Asia 
and Germany; they extend to the country of India, as well. 
Diwali, the biggest Hindu festival, and also celebrated by 
Sikhs and Jains, falls during this time of the year. The dates 
vary every year according to the Hindu lunar calendar, and 
this year Diwali will be celebrated with its usual pomp and 
show on Oct. 15.
The reasoning behind celebrating Diwali, also called 
Deepavali, which literally means festival of lights, draws 
from an ancient Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The Ramayana 
tells the story of a young prince  Ram  who is exiled 
from his kingdom along with his beautiful wife Sita and loyal 
brother Lakshman, and who is condemned to roam the forests 
for 14 years.
During their exile, Ravana, a 10-headed demon and the ruler 
of an island called Lanka  analogous to present day Sri 
Lanka  hears about Sitas wondrous beauty and decides to 
kidnap her for himself. Once he succeeds, he brings Sita back 
with him to Lanka and keeps her prisoner in his vast palace 
gardens.
Overcome with grief, Ram summons all the help he can 
get, builds a bridge of stones to Lanka, and succeeds in 
defeating Ravana in a final battle. This day, on which good 
triumphed over evil, is a special one in Hindu mythology and 
is celebrated as Dussehra. This year, Dussehra was celebrated 
on Sept. 28, and roughly two weeks later, when Ram came 
home with his rescued wife, Diwali is celebrated to rejoice in 
his return.
The night of Rams return to his kingdom was a new moon 
night, causing the entire city to be cloaked in darkness. In 
order to brighten up the city, all the citizens of the kingdom 
lit lamps in their hom6s and lined their courtyards and 
windows with lights, making the city bright and beautiful.
To this day, on Diwali, Hindus light lamps and celebrate 
Rams homecoming. They also burst firecrackers and set
off fireworks  the Indian sky on Diwali night is a sight to 
behold.
The Sri Venkateswara temple in Pittsburgh has an annual 
Diwali celebration that is open for everyone to attend. They 
have delicious Indian food, sweets, dance performances, 
and firework displays  all the components of an enjoyable 
Diwali. OM, the spiritual organization for Hindus, Jains, and 
Sikhs, usually organizes a bus to transport students to the 
temple. Check their website st www.cmu-om.org/ioi more 
information.
The legend of Ram and his journey is of such great importance 
to Hindus because Ram is considered to be a reincarnation 
of one of the three most important Hindu gods: Vishnu. 
Hinduism mainly worships three gods: Brahma, the creator; 
Vishnu, the sustainer; and Shiva, the destroyer. Vishnu is 
the peoples god and solves their problems and soothes their 
miseries. From time to time, he takes the form of a human 
or animal and comes to the Earth to directly influence the 
people. Ram is one of Vishnus most popular reincarnations.
Due to the vast number of gods in Hindu mythology, 
the festival of Dussehra has more than story behind its 
celebration. Like most cultures, the change of seasons has a 
significant impact on the festivals in Hinduism, and Hindus 
celebrate Navaratri, literally meaning nine-day festival, 
at the beginning of autumn every year. This festival, which 
culminates on a 10th day  Dussehra  celebrates the 
female goddess Durga, because she finally slays a demon 
she has been battling for nine days. Thus, in both traditions, 
Dussehra represents the triumph of good over evil.
Apart from the usual forms of celebration like visiting temples 
and distributing sweets, Navaratri is characterized by a 
popular form of Indian dance called gaiba. Gaiba originated in 
the western state of Gujarat, and during this festival, people 
get together and dance gaiba to catchy music.
The colorful dance forms of gaiba are not just seen in India, 
but here on our campus as well. Last Friday, OM organized

their annual Navaratri Garba, giving a chance for the student 
body to take part in Hindu traditions.
Carnegie Mellon has a truly diverse population, and it is 
great to see a facet of every culture being celebrated here on 
campus. If you want to learn more about other countries and 
their customs, try to attend the events happening around 
campus  people are more than welcoming and are happy 
you want to learn about their traditions.

According to an article in this weeks 
issue, 50 people showed up for the first 
glee club meeting of the year, which the 
writer notes is a harbinger of what could 
be the best year ever for the group. 
Honestly, this just reminded me that the 
new television series Glee, shown on 
Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on Fox, is pretty 
solid and you should consider watching 
it. Also, Did you know? will now be

students outside the Margaret Morrison

nunchakus to the altercation and caused

Pop artist John Mayer returns with 
his new album Battle Studies, a 
collection of songs that boast his 
great voice and excellent guitaring 
skills.

Real music, new sound
John Mayer brings it back with Battle Studies
If John Mayer was at the top of your music list or held a 
sacred place in your iTunes memory, worry no more, because 
Mayer is resurfacing with his new album, Battle Studies, 
which will be released Nov. 17, 2009 on Columbia Records. 
This fourth studio album is co-produced by John Mayer 
and Steve Jordan, and includes sounds from 70s and '80s 
California rock and pop. Battle Studies was recorded in a 
private home in California where Mayer lived for six months 
before heading to Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. The album 
has some great new songs, including the first single "Who 
Says," in which Mayer questions conventional society norms, 
along with Heartbreak Warfare," Assassin," and War of 
My Life, which feature universal themes. Rock Song and a 
reinterpretation of "Crossroads" give us a chance to hear the 
famous guitar playing we know Mayer for.
A John Mayer tour is currently being planned to begin in 
early 2010, following the release of Battle Studies. Until then, 
fans can see Mayer in concert in two performances with 
the John Mayer Trio, composed of Mayer, Jordan, and Pino 
Palladino. The first performance is on Dec. 29 in San Diego 
at the Copley Symphony Hall and a New Years Eve show on 
Dec. 31 at the Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las 
Vegas. The first concert is replacing Mayer's annual Holiday 
Revue performance, and both events will be raising money for 
Military Outreach Ministry Camp Pendleton (MOM) and the 
Veterans Health Research Institute (NCIRE), two veterans 
charities.
Battle Studies can be expected to be a great album, 
considering Mayer's notable history. Aside from the seven 
Grammys (one of which he won in 2003 for the Best Male Pop 
Vocal) that he has under his belt and the 12.5 million albums 
he has sold worldwide, Mayer was placed on Time magazines 
Time 100 list of the most influential contemporary thinkers, 
leaders, artists, and entertainers in May 2007. He was also 
featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazines annual 
"Guitar issue. Mayer achieved multi-platinum status with
his first two studio albums, Room for Squares and Heavier 
Things, and his music has been featured in hit movies such 
as The Bucket List. He has even written pieces for magazines, 
including the likes of Esquire, a men's magazine.
Mayers 2006 album, Continuum, was also produced by Mayer 
and Jordan. The first single on this album, Waiting on the 
World to Change, is a song that almost everyone knows and 
loves, and it became popular very quickly. Within a week of 
its release on July 11, 2006, it was the third-most downloaded 
song of the week on the iTunes Music Store.
On the performance side, Mayer has collaborated with a wide 
variety of artists across the genres, including hip-hop, rock, 
and the blues. He has performed or recorded with BB King, 
Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and The Dixie 
Chicks, and his upcoming album features new teen sensation 
Taylor Swift in the song Half of My Heart.
Fans take Mayer very seriously as an artist, but he shows 
himself to be another person. Here it is. Gibberish. Lyrics 
that mean nothing. Arrangements set in sand. But a vibe. 
Maybe it grows into a full song, maybe it just informs another. 
But being my own producer, as all songwriters are, means 
saying to myself,.just write it,  Mayer said on his website 
johnmayer.com. "Judging a song while writing it is like 
grounding a toddler. I dont know how, but trust me." And 
from words like these, we get the John Mayer we know and 
love today.

of a lecture.
Your chronic underachievement starts to impact your personal life when 
you are turned down for a date because your lifetime Pac-Man high 
score is insufficient.
The stars' suggest you adopt a schedule that devotes at least three 
hours a day to worshiping the Egyptian god Maat. If you do so, you 
will be blessed with an increased stomach capacity.
Your week will come to a high point when you discover that you 
have the ability to generate an ultrasonic pulse that repels insects. 
Unfortunately, this is also the mating call of common toads, who find 
you irresistible.

Last Friday, Dress-for Success, an organization that helps 
underprivileged women by providing them with profes
sional attire, held a concert called "Women Rock!" that 
benefited the organization. Many women artists performed 
musical pieces; pictured is a group of women who, while 
dancing, removed their bras and dumped them into a trash 
can. Just before the performance ended, all the women 
took their T-shirts off, as well.
