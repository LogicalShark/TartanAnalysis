Miss Ida Tarbell at The Margaret Morrison Carnegie School.
Miss Ida M. Tarbell made a short visit on Friday 
afternoon to the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School. 
Accompanied by Mrs. A. Leo Weil, Mrs. Enoch Rauh, 
Miss Elizabeth G. Mitchell and Mrs. Dr. Richard E. 
Brenneman, she visited the various departments with 
Dean West. Before she left she made a short ad
dress to the girls, saying in part:
I am very, very gald to meet you. I have but one 
day in Pittsburgh, and this morning when I came to 
my friends and learned that I had been invited to 
visit the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School, I said,. 
That is the one thing in Pittsburgh that I meant to 
ask to be taken to. I have heard vague rumors of 
what you are doing here, and I have felt that you 
are working out something that I have had on my 
mind and heart for years. I think the reason it has 
been on my heart so much is that my own educa
tion was so neglected, for, while I have been working 
and studying all my life, I have never been able to 
learn the things that are most closely related to a 
womans life. I am a great believer in the profession 
of being a woman, and I think we should be taught 
to do in a scientific way the things that naturally, 
unavoidably and fundamentally should be ours. I 
am quite overpowered on being shown here in a few 
minutes that you are doing all these things. I feel 
that you are working out a tremendous problem, and 
are going to be an inspiration and suggestion to the 
whole country. I shall do all I can to carry your 
message elsewhere, for I believe that the things we 
study should be related to the life we lead. Life is
a profession and a science, and we should be taught 
to so regard it. I am very glad to have this oppor
tunity of meeting you, and thank you for your cordial 
greeting.
MHO CLUB VS. ARCHITECTS.
The Mho Club baseball team again displayed their 
superiority over their old rivals, last Saturday morn
ing, by annexing nine runs in their column to six by 
the Architects. Although the Mho Club does not 
claim a victory since the Architects did go to bat in 
the last inning, still it is doubtful whether this lead 
would have been overcome. The Mho Club outbatted 
their rivals at all times and only the intervening of 
the groundkeeper, who stopped the game, saved the 
Architects from evident defeat.
Prof. Hower's course in photography promises to 
be popular this spring if present indications are to be 
considered.
A report has been started which indicates that cer
tain members of the Junior Electric class will secure 
summer positions teaching electricity.
The Mho Club would like a baseball game Satur
day morning. See McCorkle for arrangements.

WESTMINSTER WINS.
Tech Unable to Hit Sampson.
Westminster came down to Pittsburgh on Saturday 
and took the game away from Tech. It was mainly 
due to the masterly pitching of Sampson, who allowed 
only five hits, keeping the same far enough apart to 
save his team mates any worry. He also struck out 
15 of the men that faced him. As a whole, his pitching 
was the finest seen around here in college circles for 
some time.
Beisgen also pitched good ball, the Westminster bat
ters connecting safely only eight times. They man
aged, however, to get their hits well bunched and 
scored thereby.
Tech did not ge't a man past second base until the 
last inning, when, with two down, Wehr, was hit by a 
pitched ball, Vail received a free pass, and Gerhart hit 
towards third. McClure made a good stop, but per
mitted the ball to get away from him. It rolled to 
Woods, who rhrew to the plate, catching Wehr.
Westminster scored right off the bat, getting one 
run across. In the sixth, on error by Morehead, a 
three-base hit by McClure, a single by Sampson, and a 
two-bagger by Parrish, netted the visitors three runs. 
He secured another in the ninth as the result of an 
error, a base on ball and a single.
Westminster had a double play to its credit. Morehead singled, Wehr then flied to Woods, who threw 
to first before Morehead could get back.
Sampsons all around work was the feature of the 
game. Besides his masterly pitching, he had two hits, 
one of which would have counted as a home run if he 
had not failed to touch second base.
In the fifth Morehead played the entire inning for 
himself, so to speak, getting all three put-outs. Vatz 
and Morehead played the star games for Tech. The 
score:

THE DENNISON GAME.
What promises to be one of the best games on the 
schedule will be played Saturday afternoon between 
the Varsity and Dennison University of Ohio.
It will be remembered that Tech and Denison played 
a oo score in foot-ball last fall. Consequently the 
game Saturday will be full of interest.
The Varsity has been practicing hard this week in 
preparation for the game Saturday.
FREDERICK HURT.
William Frederick, 09, Electrical, was painfully hurt

PLEBE BASE BALL.
Nn the first scheduled game of the season on the 
home grounds, the Freshman team won easily from 
Aast Liberty Academy by the score of 4-1. But six 
innings were finished, as the grounds were vacted 
at 2:45 for the Hech-Westminster game.
Hhe Freshmen took a batting streak in the first 
half of the seventh, piling on five more runs, but the 
inning not being completed, these scores were dis
carded.
Schad had the Academy team at his mercy, allow
ing but four scattered hits and striking out eight 
men in the six innings. Fisher was somewhat wild 
at times, but otherwise threw steady ball. Clements 
three-bagger in the first inning was a feature. Score:

TO CHEER OR NOT TO CHEER.
When its a fine day, and the team is winning and 
all of the girls you care about are nearby and keep 
saying, Oh! Isnt it just splendid, it is a very easy 
thing to cheer from the very joy of being alive. In 
fact it would be decidedly inappropriate not to mani
fest pleasure at having such company and fairly 
chortele at the oodles of money you were winning on 
bets. Your lungs would ache and creak to say noth
ing of what your voice would sound like. Everybody 
happy, and lots of noise.
Now when it has been raining and the damsel^ 
finery has been slightly dampened, to say nothing 
of her ardor and enthusiasm, and the team has a 
loosing streak and the band is not playing, we ac
knowledge that it is a difficult task to rah-rah. To 
act cheerful in the face of defeat is neither easy nor 
pleasant, but what of it? To be forced to look at the 
spectacle of a loosing team is no novelty for the stu
dent body of Carnegie Tech, but this business of 
getting a grouch over it is something not to be added 
to our accomplishments. Its anything but a thing 
to be proud of.

APPLIED DESIGN MAN HONORED.
The Department of Architecture has just received 
the information from the Chairman of the Committee 
on Education of the Society of Beaux Arts in New 
York that William H. King, Jr., a senior student, has 
been successful in gaining admission to the final com
petition for the Paris Prize, offered to students of 
architecture in the United States, under the auspices of 
that Society.
This is a signal honor in the architectural world and 
Mr. King is the first student from Pittsburgh who has 
won it. The Paris Prize is offered yearly by the So
ciety of Beaux Arts and consists of $2,500.00 to cover 
the expenses of the winner for two years study at the 
Ecole de Beaux Arts in Paris, and travel in foreign 
countries. It is offered through the munificence of 
various wealthy American patrons of the arts, among 
whom is Mr. Andrew Carnegie. The current prize 
this year is offered by His Excellency Robert Bacon, 
American Ambassador to France.
The competition for the prize is open annually to any 
American student registered in the educational classes 
conducted by the Society for the instruction of stu
dents in architecture. The students of the Carnegie 
Technical Schools are among those of the various 
other schools so registered. The winner of the prize 
is admitted without examination to advanced studies in 
the Ecole de Beaux Arts by a special decree of the 
French Minister of Public Instruction. This is a priv
ilege not accorded by the School to the sUidents of any 
other country, not exceptingthose of France. In con
sequence the competition for this prize annually enlists 
the efforts of the most brilliant architectural students 
of America, and the winner is regarded as having at
tained especial distinction. Three competitions are re
quired of the contestants. The first preliminary con
sists of a 12-hour sketch problem in design which must 
be made en loge, that is, without reference to books 
or photographs or assistance in any way. This year 
about 100 contestants entered this first trial of strength, 
by which 20 were chosen for the second competition. 
This second competition consists of a 24-hour sketch 
problem in design which is also completed en loge. 
From the second preliminary competition five students 
are chosen for the final competition, which consists of 
a problem in design of a monumental character, for 
the solution of which the competitors are allowed 
about two months. The five final competitors or 
logists, as they are called, are required to prepare 
their drawings for this design in New York City and 
are allowed by the Society a sum sufficient to cover 
their expenses during the period covered by the com
petition.
The logists in the final competition for this year 
are:
Wm. H. King, Jr., Carnegie Technical Schools.
 Valere de Mari, Atelier Burnham, Chicago, 111.
K. E. Carpenter, Mass. Inst, of Technology, Boston,
C. E. Hall, Atelier Hornbostel, New York City.
A. F. Adams, Atelier Prevot, New York City.
Among others, students of the following architectural 
schools were enlisted in the competition:
Columbia University.
University of Pennsylvania.
Atelier Ware, New York.
Atelier Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio.
Atelier T Square Club, Philadelphia.
Drexel Institute, Philadelphia.
Atelier McKim, New York.
Atelier Boston Architectural Club, Boston.
NIN ETEEN-THI RTEEN NIGHT.
A Memoir.
History was made on Wednesday evening, April 13,
1910, at the Hotel Lincoln, for tis safe to say that we 
can go down oil record as being the first second 
year class of Carnegie Tech to turn out en masse at 
the annual banquet. Never could a more jollyficated 
crowd than the one that calls itself Thirteen be 
rounded up. Excitement reigned for about fifteen 
minutes before President Farrell put in his appearance, 
which happened about 9 o'clock P. M. Nineteen-Fourteen were just about to be the objects of a hunt, and 
subsequently the recipients of a mauling and a possible 
dip in the drink, when his highness hove in sight, 
one block away, walking at a gait that seemed to defy 
us to go on without him. Tis needless to say the 
joy then dethroned excitement.
Hats off to Toastmaster Cole. It was an program 
(exclusive of the execution of Dat Mendelssohn 
Tune by Bauer). However, Prof. Lowes (we call 
him one of the fellows now) words of consolation 
washed the execution from our memories for the re
mainder of the evening.
His easy manner, and ability to speak delightfully 
on any topic, whether scientific or every day, makes 
him a universal favorite in the class. That magnetic 
power of commanding ones full attention is the accom
plishment of a rare few. He is at home with the 
fellows. Due praise must be given -g108Si01x th.0( 
Who knew that we had such a flowery speaker in our 
midst? He handled the affair with all the dignified, 
yet whimsical air of a really toastmaster.
Each of the members of the Faculty came in for a 
merry jolt at the hands of Hark-a-lu-lu Berg, while 
on the other hand, Farrell handed out a few to divers 
of us. Bannens talk on The Night Student was 
based on facts, and true to life. He depicted the 
enormity of the work required of a practicing student.
Madgetts Athletics was well done. While we 
might say that he was a wee bit harsh in his denuncia
tion of the average night students view of school ath
letics, yet his idea of school spirit is feasible.
Jimmy McIntosh, our Vice, still holds that he is 
not gifted with gab, and rather resorts to reading 
his speeches. He thinks we have forgotten of his oc
casional arguments during class meetings. As a mat
ter of fact, Our Jim is an orator, but is a little lack
ing of confidence in himself, when it comes to a formal 
talk. His essay on the coming base-ball season, with 
his abounding new stories were delightful.

turing Company. Hhis occasion was taken by the 
aforeivamed to cite a few incidents of their practical 
experience in the field of electric engineering, which 
proved very interesting to the members and also 
served as a stimulant to the Mho Club members to 
be more efficient in laboratory testing at school. Hhe 
appreciation of the address was obviously manifested 
by the hearty applause and subsequently, the vote 
of thanks attributed Messrs. Casey and Slocum.

a suitable token, bearing the Mho Club design, and 
present the same to Mr. Dentonin advent of his 
leavingin behalf of his loyal and serviceable efforts 
toward the Mho Club.
Hhe members then retired to partake of the sump

were exchanged to float upon the breezes of the silent 
night. John A. Clark, Secy.

No! the secret, please, keep;
Indiscretion in Diet 
Made all go to sleep.
Cecilia K. Bradt.
Miss Ida Tarbell visited school on Friday afternoon, 
and after being shown through the building, addressed 
the student body. Miss Tarbell stayed only a day in 
Pittsburgh, so we should be complimented that she 
gave some of that short time to our school.
On Saturday the Senior Household Arts Class had a 
pretty luncheon at the Fort Pitt, afterwards going to 
the Nixon to see De Wolf Hopper. Everyone en
joyed herself to the fullest and feels better after hav
ing relieved the tension of their winter of work.
Miss Bradt wrote some very appropriate verses which 
she presented to the girls on the occasion. They ex
plain the affair clearly, and for the benefit of those who 
have not read them they are published here:
A group of Scotch lassies 
All weary of books 
Of studying diets 
And how to be .cooks,
Decided one spring day,
(All to advice deaf)
Theyd sample a real meal 
Cooked by a real chef.
They went to the Fort Pitt,
A dozen, all told,
And ordered viands,
Some hot and some cold,
Regardless of knowledge 
Theyd gained at their school,
That foods, raw or cooked, should 
Be eaten by rule.
At the end of the feast 
They hastened to go 
To the Nixon to see 
De Wolf Hopper's good show;
Theres nothing that gives us 
Such pleasure, folks say,
When weary and heartsick,
As some lively play.
At first they wTere happy,
But ere long waxed sad;
Think you twas the music 
Made them far from glad,
Made them all so quiet?

LECTURE COURSE.
The first lecture in the series being given under the 
direction of the faculty of* the School of Applied Sci
ence took place last Wednesday night, when Prof. 
Keller delighted a large audience by his account of 
the heavenly bodies. The Assembly Hall filled to the 
doors, presented an unusual spectacle bn account of 
the large number of-women present. Prom the start 
to the beginning the lecturer held the attention of the 
throng by his breezy style and quaint humor.
One of the greatest objects of having this , series of 
talks on scientific subjects was that the outside public 
might have the chance to keep abreast of the times in 
this direction. The marked attention paid the speaker 
throughout his discourse, and the number of the gen
eral public who accepted the invitation made it certain 
that the object of the course is not going to fall short 
of the .original intention.
Dr. John A. Brashear lectures this week on the 
camera as related to our advanced knowledge of the 
heavenly bodies.

The first of the general elections under consideration 
by the Board of Control as the best solution of the prob
lem of getting the interest-of .the student body was 
tried last Friday. From the result it looks as though 
this method will be successful for the selection of all 
assistant managers. The election resulted in making 
Hecker and Manker official occupants of the places of 
assistant managers for the present season.
