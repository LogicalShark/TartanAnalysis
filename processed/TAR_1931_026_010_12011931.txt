Drama Students
Performance To Continue 
From Saturday 
Dec. 5-16
BIG CAST SELECTED
Franklin Heller to Portray 
Famous Character 
Of Hajj
With the presentation of Edward 
Knoblocks Kismet, under the di
rection of E. W. Hickman, students 
in the department of drama will, 
undertake the most ambitious pro
gram of the year. The play will 
run from Saturday, December 5, 
through the sixteenth, .covering ten 
evening performances and a matinee. 
Nearly every student in the depart
ment will take some part in the pro
duction, if not in the cast, then in 
the crew or in the technical staff. 
Directors in charge of costumes, 
lighting and scenic construction, have 
combined effort and ingenuity to make 
this play a colorful and delightful 
pageant, and arc using entirely new 
ideas in the design of the scenery. .
In 1911, when "Kismet wasfirst 
produced in America, it crowdcd the 
Knickerbocker theater in New York 
from December until the ensuing 
summer. Ivnoblock made a fortune 
from "Kismet and Otis Skinner 
says: "Hajj brought me more wide
spread success than any part I ever 
played. (

version in 1920 by the Robcrtsonj Cole Company, and in the talkies in

Christmas Chapel 
Will Be Dec. 15
The next and also the last chapel 
before Christmas vacation will be 
held December 15, at 12:30, in the 
Little Theater of the Fine Arts 
Building. Dr. Thomas S. Baker will 
preside. This Chapel is interdenomi
national, and everyone is invited, to 
come. Most of the time will be de
voted to the singing of Christmas 
carols, which will be the main fea
ture of the service.
This is the best attended chapel 
of the year. Almost everyone comes 
out to join in the caroling, the music 
for which will be provided by the 
Music Department. A Bible reading 
will precede the singing. The pro
gram . of the songs has not been 
made up yet, but it will probably 
consist of those Christmas carols that 
arc well liked b3r everyone.
This service gives everyone a

Players Will Buy Tickets 
To Enter Charity Game
For the first time in the his
tory of any sports event in the 
Greater Pittsburgh District, and 
probably anywhere in the world, 
.participants in an athletic event 
will pay their way into the 
scene when the members of the 
Carnegie Tartans and Duqucsne 
Duke football squads purchase 
tickets to the post season bene
fit tilt which, will be held in 
the Stadium Saturday after
noon, December 5.
Speaking for the Tech squad, 
Captain Armcntrout said: It 
is a small contribution but we 
are happy tc do this much for 
the unemployed of Allegheny 
County in addition to giving 
our services.
"Those are our sentiments 
too, declared Captain Mike 
Fcrrarc, of the Duqucsne 
Eleven. We were tickled also 
when w.c heard that the sports 
writers had to pay as well.
Professors Direct 
Research Work
Seven Fellowship Students

Problems
Under the direction of four of 
the professors of the Chemistry 
department, seven fellowship stu

lems which include several liighlytcchnical subjects.
Richard Hcrter and James McAteer, graduates of Carnegie in 
1931, are working with Dr. Seitz in 
the examination of their research 
subjects. Hcrter is. studying The 
Raccmization of Optically . Active

Thtf Soph Hop committee will hold 
a meeting this week to make final 
plans for. the annual dance of the 
Sophomore class. The date for the 
danc: has been definitely set as Fri
day, January 8, and, if plans for the 
work are not interrupted, the New 
Union, will be .used for the first 
time on that occasion. If the work

committee will try to hold the dancc 
off-campus.
Programs have been selected and 
decorations have been s planned by 
Mary Husband. The admission price 
for the dance will be lower than it 
has been in previous years, but as

Maggy Murph Frosh Burn Symbols
In Great Sacrificial Conflagration
Solemn Rites Mark End Of Plebe Regulations Period 
As Freshmen Sing Dear Old Tech
Over Dying Embers
The class of 1935 of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College cele
brated the end of plebe regulations 
with the. solemn burning of their 
armbands, on Wednesday, Novem
ber 25. The bright yellow arm
bands with the stripes of plaid, 
symbolic of all freshmen classes 
of Margaret Morrison, were sac
rificed to the great god of fire.
The stretch of open land between 
Beeler Street and Woodlawn Ave
nue proved a perfect setting for 
the ceremony held by these plcbcs, 
The sacrificial fire was built by 
the more energetic of the mourn
ful throng and soon was burning 
briskly. Then th occasion took on 
a real significance for the girls, 
forming a circle, slowly marched 
around the brightly burning funer
al pyre and threw their armbands 
into the flames. As the jcll'jT'-, 
blue, and red tongues of fire gro.'* 
ily licked up these symbols oi 
ireshman days* the girls solemnly
sang "Dear Old Tech, Fight for 
the Glory jof Carnegie, Alma 
Mater, and "Taps. As the last 
of the yellow armbands became 
blackened crisps among the ashes, 
silence reigned while the freshmen 
thought seriously of the years 
ahead of them and gazed sadly at 
the charred remains of their first 
introduction to college life.
This was an occasion when the 
plebes stood alone watching the 
slowly dying embers, for the soph
omores, usually present at all fresh
man undertakings, were conspicu
ous by their absence. It is also 
interesting to note that the Oak
land Police Station failed to re
spond to a hurried call by an over
excited individual w'ho feared for 
the safety of the students of Car
negie Tech.
The Class of 1935 established a 
* tradition when it inaugurated the 
burning of armbands as the finish
ing touch to "plebe regulations.

Christian Gauss 
To Give Lecture
Who Shall Go To College 
Topic Of Princeton 
Authority
Christian Gauss, Dean of Princeton 
University, will lccturc this evening 
on "Who Shall Go to College at 
the Y. AI. & W. Hi A. on Bellcficld 
avenue. He has acquired a store of 
knowledge of collegiate life and col
lege students, and is well able to 
define the type of person who .should 
be admitted to American universities 
and the type of educational program 
which should be presented.
Dean Gauss has studied extensive
ly since his matriculation from the 
University of Michigan in 1898. He 
received his degree of Master of 
Arts at the University, which offered 
him a position as instructor in ro
mance languages. He left Michigan 
in 1901 for a similar post at Lehigh. 
In 1905 he became Assistant Pro
fessor of Romance Languages at 
Princeton, and was promoted to pro
fessorship in 1907, and to head of 
his department in 1913. Gauss was 
appointed Dean in 1925, although lie 
continued his classes and occupied 
the Chair of Alodern Languages at 
that time.
Gauss is the author of four books 
which are frequently used as refer

Seriously Speaking
A Column of Curious Comment 
By NATHAN MILLER
Civil Servants
We suffer today from an oversupply of men who are motivated 
solely by acquisitive instincts, by the 
desire to gain and amass personal 
wealth. This type is of course a 
vast improvement upon the savage 
plunderer of old, over the pirate and 
the swashbuckler But the difference 
between them is one of degree rather 
than one of kind.
On the other hand, the pages of 
history attest to the influence, slight 
and sporadic to be sure, of the edu
cated and disinterested type of man. 
H. G. Wells, in his most recent 
work, "The Work, Wealth and Hap
piness of Mankind, draws the origin, 
of this strain from the priestly class 
in whom resided the  first instincts 
of the detached scientist and the 
learned and unworldy student.
Throughout the modern world of 
business, finance and education we 
find-the dispersal of these .various 
personal typesthe distinctive .fea
ture being this ultimate source of 
inspiration for personal conduct, the 
rapacious self-interest usually built 
around a core of money gain, or 
the disinterested attachment to ideals 
or professional standards of work 
and service. Often the motives arc 
mixed but by and large, one pre
dominates over the other according 
to the nature of the work.
In the civil service of the world, 
for instance, one finds the largest 
body of individuals' specialized out 
for the latter type of endeavor. 
These personsthe permanent staffs 
of governmentsrepresent that ideal 
of  disinterested work for the com
monweal which must infect the entire 
body of modem work before we 
shall even begin to be able to see 
the solution of the grave problems 
affccting us. In other professions, like 
the law and medicine, we still wit
ness the struggle between the selfseeking money-getter and the sincere 
student and public servant.

Eminent English 
Statesman Urges 
Friendly Relation
Sir Harry Brittain Predicts 
Airline Within 
Two Years
ENGLAND ADOPTS TARIFF
Relations Between Eng
land and U. S. Best 
In History
Sir Harry Brittain addressed the 
student body Carnegie Day on 
relationships between the United 
States and England.
The theme of Sir Harrys re
marks was that the  relationship 
between the United States and 
England should be a cordial one 
at all times, for although the 
United States sometimes considers 
itself a melting-pot for all nations, 
is was originally founded by Eng
lishmen and given the basic ideals 
of English government.
The difference between the gov
ernment of England and that of 
the United States lies in the fact 
that England docs not have a writ
ten Constitution, while the United 
States has. Their laws arc passed 
by the House of Commons, the 
House of Lords, and the assent of 
the king. According to Sir Harry, 
people arc quite satisfied with this 
form of rule.
Jus recently England has been 
forced for protection to break 
their free trade rule and adopt a 
tariff. This has been due to tjic 
tariff increase on imports by the 
United States. The tariff question, 
however, should not cause a break 
in the friendship of the United 
States and England which has 
within the last decadu been brought 
together in a firm bond of union 
by the modern methods of com
municationthe radio and the air
plane.
Sir Harry predicted that within 
two years there would be an airline 
connecting Great Britain and the 
United States. Tlic airships would 
be launched from floating ships 
'stationed at various points in the 
ocean.
At present the feeling between 
the United States and Great Brit
ain has never been better, and it 
is hoped that there will no inter
ruptions to these cordial relations.

Aeronautic Dept. 
Starts Research
Study Of Water Channel 
And Wind-Tunnel 
Taken Up
Pioneer research work on air flow 
in its relation \ to aviation is now 
getting well under way in the Aero
nautic Department of Alechanical En
gineering. Air condilions around air
plane wings and bodies, not yet well 
understood, will be investigated with 
a water channel, now constructed and 
ready for use, and in a wind-tunnel, 
the acccsories for which are not yet 
quite finished.
One type of experimenting employs 
a wooden channel filled with water. 
The model which is being studied is 
towed through the water and photo
graphs of the stream lines arc taken 
by a camera on the same mounting 
as the mo'dcl. Deductions about air 
flow can be made from these pic
tures because of similarity in this 
respect between air and water.
The other method is concerned 
with photography of actual air flow, 
using a wind-tunnel in which the 
model is mounted, A stream of air 
which has been heated in layers by 
a platinum grid is passed by the 
model at high velocity. The air cur
rents around the tunnel can be 
photographed because of the diffcr(Continucd on Page Two)

PRICES ARE REDUCED
Two Football Teams Will 
Meet For First 
Encounter
When the Plaid of Carnegie meets 
the Red and Black of Duqucsne in 
the charity benefit gridiron tilt in the 
Pitt Stadium Saturday at 2 p. m., 
the occasion will mark, the first meet
ing in a major sport of teams rep
resenting the two schools.
Elaborate preparations have been ' 
made for the game of which the 
entire proceeds will be turned over 
to the joint relief organization of 
the Welfare Fund and the Allegheny 
County Emergency Association. The 
game is one of a large number of 
charity contents being staged between 
leading teams throughout the country 
in response to the invitation of Owen 
D. Young.
Aside'from tlic charity benefit the 
game has aroused interest because it 
is believed that the meeting will lead 
to others in the future and may, in 
time, assume a traditional aspect such 
as that which now exists between 
Carnegie and Pitt.
Price reductions have been an
nounced in the belief that the game 
should be brought within the reach

This is the story of the depres
sion in Southern California and 
elsewhere, or rather, to be exact, 
in the University of Southern Cali
fornia, the University of Arizona, 
Northwestern University, Univer
sity of Utah, and various other 
western centers of culture and 
learning,
The story begins with a "once 
upon a time the girl.s of U. S. C. 
got together and . . decided 
that something ought to be done 
about the high cost of dating. 
Forthwith they announced a com
prehensive program. They agreed 
to pay the full cost of a date if 
the man in the case measured up 
to their standards ,of a "perfect 
man, and if he rated only 50 per 
cent, they agreed to pay a propor
tionate part of the expenses.
Here is their rating of a model 
man:
Intelligence, 20 per ccnt.
Cultural Background, 15 per ccnt.
Personal Appearance, 15 per cent. 
Courtesy, 10 per cent. 
Personality, 10 per cent.
Sense of Humor, 10 per ccnt 
Physical Fitness. 5 per ccnt. 
Social Poise, 5 per ccnt.
Clear Understanding of the word 
"No, 5 per cent,
Dancing Ability, 5 per ccnt. 
Promptly upon their decision 
came the announcement of the 
University of Arizona girls that 
they had formed a Spinster Chtl* 
whose members promised to split 
the costs of dates with their es-< 
corts. At the same time, the men 
at Arizona formed a Bachelors 
Club. The members pledged them
selves to date no girls but those 
who would go dutch.
Their near neighbors, the Uni
versity of Utahitcs, immediately 
began considering the idea of the 
50-50 plan. Some of them adopted 
the plan without further ado, but

C
ARNEGIES DISPLAY OF EAST AND FURIOUS football against the N. Y. U. Violets 
last Thursday convinced many more grid fans 
that the Skibos reputation for a lighting team 
is well founded. The Steffen-Waddell machine coped with their opponents rough and 
tumble gridiron manners to such an extent 
that the New Yorkers were outplayed for the 
first three quarters. An apparently invincible 
Plaid team swept the field with an accurate 
serial offense during the first thirty minutes 
of play, but, with the aid of strong substitutes, the Violets overcame a tired combination ol 
Scotchmen by a one-point margin in the final 
ll frame.******
TYPICAL FOOTBALL THRILLS kept the crowd from 
their seats, and, no doubt, severely strained the necks of those riding by in the "Ls. Stewart, Ostrosky, Ewing, and Vorderbcrg all shared in that art of snagging passes from Stew Ducger. This method of attack upset the "woiks" at an early stage when 
the Plaid machine pulled a fake line buck that turned out to bra successful thirty-yard pass. Red Stewart made a nice 
citch of the oval and then raced the remaining thirty yards for the Tartans lone six-counter. Any eye-witness to this touch
down will always remember that it was Chuck Ewing who put Tanguay out of running commission so that Stewart could pass 
the goal line unmolested.b * * * * *
DURING A FRUITLESS INVASION into the Violet 
territory Elmer Vorderberg caught a forty yard pass at the ex
pense of his personal embarrassment. The New Yorkers had been tackling at a hard rate, but this time their ire was aroused to such a point that they literally tore the hide off Vorderberg. 
When he rose from the turf his hare leg was in plain vic\y of 
the Skibo fans. Bertie MUnhail rushed to .the situation with 
his faithful adhesive and then the game proceeded.
Although Captain Armcntrout's playing was versatile, wc 
fail to agree with the statement that he led the Skibo Band. However, the Kilties put on. their usual colorful performance 
that adds so much to a Carnegie game.
+ * * # +
CARNEGIES UNHERALDED BASKETBALL combina
tion will give their first public appearance of the season to
night when they meet the Y. M. H. A. tossers in the, home 
gym. Coach Hogan is still in the process of rounding the 
squad into shape, and might find plenty to work on after this 
evenings practice scrimmage.The Plebca are due to takfc the floor at 7 p. m. with some opponent yet to be named. A large freshman squad promises a 
game full of action. Students will be admitted with the athletic 
book, general admission being one dollar.
*****
MOKE MONEY FOR C'liARTTY -will be realized from a 
charity boxing show which is bcirtg arranged in the near future. 
From the Carnegie stables Waldron, Kurke, Carr, and Coach 
Scsto will ably assist in making the show a huge success. As yet the details of the bouts, arc not known, but there is but ittlc doubt that, they will all be top-nbtchers. The Skibo team 
has been working out for some time now, and accqrding to 
Coach Scsto, are rounding out in good shape. Burke put in a good bit of road-work over the last week-end when he attempt
ed to thumb his way from New York to Pittsburgh, and should 
he quite a few weeks ahead in that phase of his-training.
* * *' * *
THIS CHARITY IDEA has finally reached the limit with 
the thought that each player must pay for his admission to the game. If this scale of prices is carried out thoroughly, theres 
a chance that some people, excluding students, will pay ten 
dollars for a hot dog.
This Saturdays grid fracas with Duquesnc will not only 
wind up the 1031 season for Carnegie, but will be the final appcarancc of Armcntrout, Ducanis, and Fletcher, mainstays of 
the past three Tartan teams. Other seniors leaving the College 
gridiron arc Potts, Pounccy, Skctres, and Ewing.
******
THE SPIRIT OF THE WELL KNOWN GOLF BUG has permeated the Carnegie campus in such a fashion this fall 
that the amount of interest directed upon a proposed golf team 
to represent the school is quite pcrcepitilble. Such a creation could easily find its place in the Skibo sport program that has 
grown in the last few years.The powers that be, in the Athletic Office are also in favor 
Oi* a Tartan golf team, and accordingly Mr. Overend' has sug
gested that any players of note, or lesser note, should turn in their three best scores of last summer to his office sometime 
this week. This census will help to determine Carnegies potential strength on the golf course.
Golf is such a game that the team must practice frequently tobe in shape for a match. Since the Schenley course is only 
pen to Pittsburghers, the question of training facilities might 
prove to be a serious one. With this in mind it seems that fall competition would be the only practical time, for the various 
stars would be in top form after a summer of playing. It also seems that matches in the spring would not prove so success
ful, for it is only the ardent playerswho would keep in shape 
over the winter season.
It seems that the Duquesne gridders hit their stride against 
the North Dakota 'Flicker,tails last week. A scrappy Duke eleven, showing diversity of plays, managed to win, i3 to' 7. 
With all speculations aside, the Bluffites must take bigger and better strides to cope with the Steffen-Waddell machine. ******
TARTAN HARRIERS worked up their Thanksgiving 
appetite with the N. Y. U. runners in the big city last week. Although their efforts did not close the season with a win, the 
runners coped everything in the turkey course on the following day. Running true to form, Captain Price, Ramsay, and Schcil carried the heavy part of the Skibos scoring.
Coach I-Ialfcrtys men have closed a rather successful season, winning three out of the five meets. This fact is reason 
to believe that the long distance events in next springs track 
meets will be well taken carc of, for the cross-country runners continue their efforts in this line.

TARTANS CLASH 
WITH DUQUESNE 
IN CHARITY GAME
Game Marks Initial Relations 
Between Carnegie 
And Dukes
'SCOTS ARE PREPARED
This Saturday secs the Tartans 
engage in the last game of the 
scascpi with Elmer Layden's Dukes 
at the Stadium and a big time is 
in store for everybody. It seems 
that finally the Bluff school has 
succccdcd in matching up with the 
Carnegie outfit and there is but lit
tle doubt that they will try thenbest to show the football world 
that they are anything but just 
another fdotball team.,
The whole thing started when 
the local higher institutions of 
learning, desiring to do something 
to aid in the rasing of funds, went 
into a huddle with the Charity 
Cpmmittce, and decided that a 
game between the two local 
schools. would be just the thing. 
For some time previous the Duquesnc boys have been waiting for 
a chance to tackle their larger 
neighbors and this Charity game 
.ideit came like a gift out of heaven.
The clash should.provide1 for the 
local football fans just the thing 
they have been waiting for, and 
by the present indications the scats 
in the Stadium should be very near 
filled. Prices for all seats have 
been lowered so as to make it 
possible for everyone to witness 
the fracas. .
Carnegie Ready
The* Steffen-Waddell outfit is be
ing. carefully groomed for the 
game and arc waiting in prepared
ness-for Saturday. They came out 
of the N. Y. U. tussle with little 
or no injuries and will be able to. 
go on the field in full strength 
for one of the few limes this sea
son. The team realizes what this 
game will, mean to cither school 
and ^consequently is endeavoring 
to brush up every little Haw and 
not leave a stone unturned in doing so.
With both squads ready to go, 
and their respective schools and 
fails behind them, the affair should 
not 'only pack the stands to capac
ity, but should provide a treat for 
King Football and . directly: aid in 
swelling the Pittsburgh' Charity' 
Fund.

Archery
The .contest which took place No-, 
vetnber 36* ended the fall archery 
aensop. As a whole the season was 
very successful because many fresh
men girls came out for the sport 
and placed high. Tlie five contest 
winners were as' follows:
Mary Warner, Alice Warner,
Ncdra Jones, Virginia Linn,
ElizabethLowry,
Tlie other contestants were: Betty 
Libby, 1ranees Hall, Margaret Par

Frances Brdwn, Lucinda Smith, 
Christine Chandler, Rutli Gustafson, 
Beatrice Moorebcad, Thelma Shelly 
and Margaret Watters.
A total of eight practices was re
quired by Manager Helen Smith for 
participation in the tournament..
In the spring there will be another 
archery season. All who have not 
come out for the fall season arc 
urged to take part then. Archery 
is a very interesting activity and an 
enjoyable sport for those who do 
not care for the more strenuous out
door games.;
Freshman Representative 
Virginia Linn has been elected 
Freshman Representative on ' the 
Womens Athletic Association Board. 
Her duties are to attend all Board 
meetings and to interest^ the girls of 
the freshman class in the minor and

Red Colin Stewart
With Rejl Stewart playing on left end, the Tartans have a 
potent part of their aerial attack in working order. One of his 
best catches of the season occured last week in the N. Y. U. 
game when Ducger heaved the oval for thirty yards to Red who 
raced another thirty for the lone touchdown.
Although Stewart carries one hundred eighty pounds, he is , 
known as one of the Skibo speed merchants. This season closes his. 
first year on the varsity squad, and much is expected of him 5n the 
next few years.

WIN CHAMPIONSHIP 
OF PA. DISTRICT
Regain District Laurels; 
Outlook Bright For 
Next Season
In the season which just closed, 
Carnegie Tech  regainedpossession 
bf the district cross-country cham
pionship which. it lost last year. 
'I'he. title came ba.ck by virtue of 
victories over Geneva, Westmin
ister and Pitt, and the repossession 
is all the sweeter since the Pan
thers aro the dethroned champs. 
The hill and dalcrs enjoyed a very 
good season and proved to be 
good losers when it was not Car
negie's day, for victory."
The lirst meet of the Season re
sulted in a victory over Geneva. 
The second contest also found Tccli 
on top but not Until a strong West
minister team pushed them to the 
limit. The Skibos first loss was 
administered by the undefeated 
West Virginia aggregation in 
meet which was too'fast for Tech. 
Then came the victory over Pitt 
and with it came the .district title 
and assurance of a successful, sea 
son.
Violets Defeat Plaid
In the last meet of the season, 
New York U's crack outfit defeated 
the Tartans 21-34 in a race which 
found Price, Ramsey and Schcil 
performing like true champions. 
N. Y. U. recently placed fourth in 
the National Intercollegiate Cham
pionship, so Carnegies defeat is by 
no means a sorrowful one.
The .cross-country squad will lose 
Jess Price and Johnny Lord by 
graduation next June. Jess has 
been captain and head man for the 
last two j'ears and his loss will 
be keenly felt. Lord is a letter 
man but had an off-year and did 
hot figure in the scoring this sea
son. Wilbur Ramsay, William 
Burns, Emil Stankey and Harold 
Neff arc juniors who will be back 
next year; the first three are letter 
men. Tlie sophomores were repre
sented this season by Shorry' Allen, 
.Bobbie S.chell, Stew Wilson and 
Alfred Prycc-Jones. The freshmen 
will send up Burke, Blair, Hoffman, 
Neff, Adams and Kulos as their 
contribution.

A SECTION OF THE TARTAN 
DEVOTED TO THE 
NIGHT STUDENTS.Ube Carnegie flMai
NIGHT ARTS DANCE 
UNION 
DECEMBER 5
Recently I read in one of the daily 
papersyes I find them to do that 
also, that the inventor of the electric 
cars, away back before most of lis 
can ' remember, came' to Pittsburgh 
to. inspect the new high-speed cars 
which promenade along our heavily 
trafficked streets. In company with 
several officials and otherwise, both 
of the Wcstinghousc and. the street 
railways company, the inventor took 
a trip along one .of tiic routes and 
at the termination of the trip lie 
congratulated  those in his company 
_at the big progt'ess. which had been 
made and also the comfort which 
the passengers were afforded when 
riding in the new high-speed cars. 
I know the individual did not ride 
at one of the peak hoursthe story 
would be different if he had. Wc 
. poor' strap hangers know how un
comfortable tese high-speed cars are.
Why. yu I,avc lo k&ep skids on 
your feet all the time you arc riding. 
First you are jolted in one direction 
find then in another, and before you 
have gone very far you -wonder if 
you are a jelly fish or soihc such 
supple objectassuming all kinds of 
shapes and forms. And if you happen 
to obtain a scat it is almost worth 
the token you pay for the ride to 
manage to keep in your scat. I have 
scot more than one person dosing 
in the car throzun into space with 
the one-man high-speed cars. But
that is the joy of being one of the 
dear public, and if you happen to be 
a night student you arc afforded the 
opportunity of riding in these omni
buses four times during the twentyfour hours. The next .thing ivc knozu 
they  will  be installing some kind of 
a bilge contrivance like they have on 
large liners to take care of the
oscillation of the cars on tlie tracks.
Now theres an idea for so^ie en
lightened engineerI'm not.
Well that Thanksgiving number of 
Puppet was surely a great number. 
" Xlie supplement was worth the t\yo 
bits aloneand that prize winner of 
a, painting of the Undcrwherc in 
Suicidewell you will have to get a 
copy to enjoy it. The numbers of 
the Puppet arc getting better and 
better if that is possible, arid I cant 
wait for the next number after I 
iiave read the current one. If you 
arent a subscriber, my advice to you 
it get this fun-making, jokc-producing college monthly and get in the 
swim of those with the perpetual 
smile. Itll help along with the hard 
' grind of attending night school.
I have noticed, there you are Didja 
Noticcand thats not your word, 
the zcay the Art students turn signs 
to the wall, that is Smoking Signs. 
Evidently they dont believe in-signs, 
or else they arc ashzmcd of them. 
Every place you go in Arts they 
have turned the signs reading "No 
Smoking to the wall and you see 
 a blank. This indicates that they 
want to smoke so all they have to do 
is obliteratethats a good term 
the offensive noticc and prestono 
rule is broken. Bctzucen no smoking 
in Margaret Morrison and in the 
Arts, we will have a No Smoking 
schoollioiv nice.
L see that our Engineering Tower 
is still dark at night while there is 
a big red star shining atop the 
Cathedral of Learning just across 
the waysorta looks down on us 
an I there is no reason for it. Why 
we generate all the power in the 
base of tha't tower and it would 
seem just the thing to transfer the 
flame to the top. Well, well, keep 
on hoping that some day the torch 
will blaze forth never to be quenched.
Night Arts To 
Hold Party 
December 5
On Saturday evening, December 
5, the *Night College of Fine Arts 
will hold the first social of the 
present school year. The Union 
has been reserved for the affair 
which will be a dance, and all in
dications are that it will be well 
attended. The committee in charge 
.of the social is working up some 
new scheme which will be a sur
prise on Saturday evening next.
All Night College of Fine Arts 
students are welcomed to attend 
this ,affair and tickets are nowbe
ing . distributed for admittance, 
which, when presented at the door 
in conjunction with your night 
registration card will pass one night 
art student and a partner.
For the benefit of the new stu
dents in Arts, the Union is located 
on the third floor of the Admin
istration Hall, and has been" the 
scene of many enjoyable night art 
functions. Any night student who 
has ever attended one of these 
affairs knows what is in store for 
them, so you new students just ask 
the older members of your class 
about it; and arrange to get your 
ticket and attend the partythe 
aommittec will do the rest.
NIGHT ENGINEERS 
TO HOLD BANQUET 
DECEMBER 19
The annual banquet of the Night 
College of Engineering will be held 
on December 19, and plans arc 
being made to make this banquet 
as successful as any ever held.
In the next issue of the Tartan 
more details will be published rela
tive this annual affair of the enginccririg college. In the mean
time the night engineers should 
mark this dateDecember 19so 
that it wont be overlooked.
Night Arts Workers 
To Rtpait At Union 
Saturday, December 5
All those students in. the Night 
College of Fine Arts who have 
sent in their names as willing to 
work are requested to be at the 
Union on Saturday afternoon, De
cember 5, at 1:30 oclock in order 
to make arrangements ' for the 
dance which will be held in the 
evening. The workers'at this func
tion will be given points which 
will apply towards securing the 
award which is made annually by 
the Night StudentCouncil. '
Bulletin Board Signs
During the past two weeks two signs 
advertising the Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance of the Night Student Council 
have been taken from the bulletin 
boards located at two different places 
on the campus. Signs are put on the 
boards for particular purposesin 
this case to advertise the Night Stu
dent Council Danceand while the 
particular signs removed were real 
works of' art still they arc adver
tisements and it is hard to believe 
that anyone would want such signs 
for a decorative purpose.
Night students are handicapped at 
the best and when they do manage to 
spare a little time to devote to extra 
curricular activities and produce signs 
of such merit as those taken, it is 
hoped that these signs will be left 
undisturbed on the bulletin boards. 
If the parties who removed the signs 
would only stop to consider the ad
vertising value of these signs which 
is lost to the Night Student Council 
wc arc sure that they would not 
take the signs. The Council there
fore makes the request that all signs 
placed by the Night Student Council, 
or its individual colleges, be left 
undisturbed.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT those Puppet hawkers seem 
to, meet you at .every turn.
THAT the night student who is 
writing his impressions of the Inter
national seems to know his stuff. 
Good work, fellow, keep it lip;
THAT several night art students 
are getting steamed up over their 
dance to be held this week.
THAT a certain first year girl .in 
P. & D: has the Romeos standing in 
line.
THAT this columtj still seemsto 
be leading a gypsy's life and keeps 
moving-all over the sheet.
THAT tlie Coal conference just, 
held here was attended by scientific 
miners.
THAT the loafing Idle Night Stu
dent is copying my style. Oh, well, 
all great columnists have imitators.
THAT the Art International is 
out for next year. Hope some 
philanthropist can spare the funds 
to hold this worthwhile show.
THAT the Engineers arc getting 
hot and bothered over that banquet 
of theirs.
THATS that and Ill be secnya!

PHI NU FRATERNITY 
HOLDS FALL MEETING
On November 14 Phi Nu, Night 
School social fraternity, held its' 
fall meeting at the Carnegie Inn, 
Following the dinner meeting; the 
semi-annual election for officers 
took place. The fraternity hopes 
to have a very active year and at 
this meeting several plank were 
discussed which iricluded a varied 
program of social activits.
NIGHT STUDENT COUNCIL 
ELECTS OFFICERS
At the November meeting, the 
first meeting of the new members 
of the Night Student Council, the 
following officers were elected: 
Vice president, Martin B. Hudale; 
Secretary, John F. Simpson; and 
.Treasurer, Henry E. Mauro. The 
four representatives which each col
lege  elects constitutes the Night 
Student Council, and this bod}' 
elects its own .officers. President 
Hodder appointed James H. Sansonetti the Night Student Council 
Social Chairman, and T. J. Werner 
Assistant Social Chairman.
Nu Sigma Alpha To 
Celebrate Fourth 
Anniversary
Nu Sigma, Alpha fraternity is 
 making plans for the fourth anni
versary celebration of the founding 
of the organization, and the com
mittee in charge has several ideas 
in mind.. However, at this time, 
nothing definite has been decided 
upon, but announcement ' of the, 
completed plans will shortly be made.
Philosophy
Some one once said that philos
ophy was the salt which seasoned 
our lives. This was meant to con
vey, of course, that after all ar
guments, discussions and facts were 
collected together, the seemingly 
incoherent mass of material was so 
arranged that some concrete ideas 
would be evident. Aside, from the 
purely traditional problems of 
philosophy which have beset the 
minds of mankind from centuries 
back, there are problems which are 
very close to the'individual. Prob
lems of ethics and the schools of 
new thought are examples of how 
philosophy has stepped forward and 
attempted to balance our thoughts 
and ideas. The question arises 
Can philosophy help us in our 
every day lives?
It needs only a little study ot 
philosophy, to bring forcibly to 
ones mind that this study tends to 
make one look at matters in a 
different light. The deeper one 
goes into philosophical problems 
the greater is the tendency to 
adopt a higher and finer standard 
of values. Although the pure 
philosophers dislike ethics, never
theless, they have been forced to 
try their hand at weighing ethical 
problems. Psychology,K that increas
ingly interesting subject made so 
on our own .campus by Dr. Sclioen, 
is a very important branch of phil
osophy. But is it not psychology or 
pure philosophy, or behaviorism or 
hedonism which is the subject oi 
this articleit is instead the at
titude which arises from the study 
of philosophy.
We study the  calculus and then 
apply it to the solution of our en
gineering problems. We study so
ciology and then attempt to rectify 
our social conditions. Why not 
then study philosophy and allow 
our change in attitude resulting 
from such studies to balance our 
lives and firid: expression in our 
actions.
This new change in attitude is 
met witli in every field, whether it 
be industry, art or in the social 
world. No longer do wc find one 
particular school of thought domi
nating our interests. Instead, we 
listen to a man and try to find out
CHRISTMAS CHAPEL
(Continued from Page One) 
chance to get the true Christmas 
spirit. The leaders hope all will be 
present as they have spent much time
if his words arc an honest expres
sion of his feelings and if so, can 
anything of use be found in his 
words. Take art, for instance. To 
be more specific, let us take paintihg.  Shall wc always permit paint
ers to portray exactly what they 
see or try to make a beautiful can
vas. If one is only interested in 
sheer beauty, then all is well and 
good.' But'art'"is a dynamic thing. 
Art tends to imbide new ideas, to 
express the artist's feelings. This 
expressionism in art originated. 
The painter tired, of being an ex
ponent of only beauty. He wished 
to express hiriisclf in a more cryp
tic style as an author or writer 
does.
In a recent issue of the Plaid an 
article entitled "A Night Students 
Impression of the Art Internation
al, was in direct line with popular 
expression. Quite true that beau
ty was lacking in all of the prize 
winners. But were the pictures 
judged by virtue of their appeal 
to ones sense of beauty? Of 
course not. Still some people rave 
on about this, modern art. Is it 
modern? Archaeologists have thou
sands of examples of this tendency 
to express ideas and thoughts 
which they have found inscribedupon ancient walls and relics.
Now, it is not the purpose of 
this article to try to win over any 
one to approving the prize winners 
in the Carnegie International. It 
would seem, however, more fitting 
and in line with present day 
thought to not hastily condemn 
something because it doesn't meet 
with one's approval.. To shout 
abuse at a painting because it 
hasnt met o'nes unqualified ap
proval is an insult to the artist 
and a shadow upon one's ability to 
look at a thing and judge it, for 
Avhat it stands for. It used to be 
that Americans eyed foreigners 
with disapproval. Because of the 
change in attitude they are accept
ed, and why not? Are they not 
human beings, are they not of the 
same intellectual and social level as 
we are?
By this time, the reader will 
wonder how all this talk of paint
ing bears upon philosophy. Just 
this muchphilosophy tends to 
broaden, to accept what is offered 
in a disinterested manner. This 
acceptance of ideas which are ne> 
to ones experience is unconscious
ly spreading everywhere. Painting 
is only a very small example. To
day we view, the problems of sex, 
economics, social relationships and 
almost anything, in a light which 
was impossible in the cramped, 
stifled era of fifty years ago. This 
change in attitude has brought us 
out of the darkness which is due 
alone to ignorance and the desire 
to adhere to a code of false stand
ards to a point where real progress 
can be made. Progress which shall 
be determined by a truer concep
tion of values. It has been the 
glorious task of philosophy, al
though it has often masqueraded 
under another name, to bring about 
this change in attitude.

A Night Students 
Impression Of The 
Art International
(Continued from Last Week)
In the French gallery I stopped to 
look at a painting by the artist 
Picasso,. no one could possibly over
look this artists work-no, I didn't 
exactly pass it by with criminal con
tempt. I once heard a lecture in 
which the speaker elevated this form 
of art to celestial heights, explaining 
that these artists really belonged to 
the highest order, that they strove 
to give expression to modern scien
tific knqwlcdgc. It -is claimed, .for 
example, that matter is not real 
were it not for the resistance in the 
aotrns, objects could pass through 
each other; as I gaze through The 
Window I see that the atoms had 
lost their resistance, the iron balcony 
rail, trees, grass arid buildings had 
become transparent and appeared as 
abstract. Whether Picasso arid his 
school have the solution to modern1 
expression by this form of art is 
a matter of opinion. But here is 
the question that Raffles mewhy 
does lie use paint and canvas when 
wrapping paper and show card colors 
would suffice as well ? "Odalisque, 
by Matisse, is perhaps tli,c first of 
his work I have ever dared to ad
mire, even from a distance. Two 
Nudes,! by Scgonzac, is almost re
pulsive.
The . Music Room in another 
gallery is one I would like to have 
in mjr own den. Then comes Duffys 
third prize. My art appreciation has
PROMPT RETURNS FOR 
THANKSGIVING RECESS 
DANCE REQUESTED
Returns foi; the Thanksgiving Re

the Night Student Council, to be 
made as soon as possible to Henry 
E. Mauro, Treasurer, Night Stu
dent Council, Box 137, C. I. T., 
Schcnlcy Park, Pittsburgh, Pa.
not yet developed to the point where 
I cari appreciate this one in even the 
remotest degree, . for as far as I 
can reason, Mr. Duffy must have 
quit art school after his first draw
ing lesson-and started painting with
out any training whatever in color 
application. The House of GerbcroyEvening, is interesting, blit why 
not take a photograph of the house 
and save time? Great Britains gal
lery is interesting. Tlie Sisters 
holds interest in its pattcrncsquc 
treatment. Probably a clue to. the 
meaning of the word "Viekanada 
would help to solve the meaning of 
the picture by that title in the Swit
zerland gallery. In the Polish gal
lery. Nude has good conception and 
treatment.
Another step takes me into the 
gallery of the U. S. S. R-. or ma
chine worshipers,, and lo a painting 
of a machine takes the cake, or 
black bread as the. prolctcriat would 
say. This is pcrhiips the only gal
lery in which all the paintings at
tempt to interpret the spirit of a
new regime. The galleries of Bel
gium, Spain, Germany and Austria 
took up much of. my time because 
there is much to admire in them all.
\s I enter the Italian gallery the 
first painting to attract my attention, 
is the much discussed Fishermen, 
by Siroui. Why those cnonrious legs? 
Well, here is my conclusion, if art is 
the expression of a physical reac
tion, then this is Sironis way of ex
pressing the t tremendous power lie 
felt was in those legs as lie watched 
the fishermen launch their heavy 
boat.
As I strolled through the balcony 
I find that for the first time Hun
gary is well represented by a good 
collection of paintings, and while I 
would not personally want to own 
all of them, a few would be ac
ceptable.
Now that I have seen the exhibit, 
here arc my conclusions : First, I 
am aware of a number of unneces
sary nudes that were not even good 
studiesmost of them were of fat 
women, badly drawn, carelessly paint
ed. and neglected background. Strange 
why some reformer had not ordered 
their banishmentI could almost 
sympathize with him. I have men
tioned mostly typical paintings, but 
there arc so many good ones in 
every gallery that time and . space 
would not permit their mention, and 
anyway your opinion is as good as 
mine. Second, that after viewing 
the paintings that belong to the class 
of isms, as impressionism, expres
sionism, etc., I think that the time 
is now ripe for some enterprising 
young artist to invent a newer form

Camels are never parched or toasted
15.0 you noticed the new trend in cigarettes?  
freshness is the popular thing.
Thats because a fresh cigarette, as demonstrated 
by Camels, is something smokers have discovered as 
better than anything they ever tried before.
Camels are fresh in the Camel Humidor Pack be
cause theyre made fresh to start with  blended of 
choice, delicately mild, sun-ripened tobaccos in which 
the natural moisture and fragrant flavors are vigi
lantly safeguarded.
The tobaccos in Camels are never parched or toasted 
 the Reynolds method of scientifically applying heat 
guarantees against that.
Thats why we say with so much assurance that 
Camels are truly fresh. Theyre made fresh  not 
parched or toasted and then theyre kept fresh in 
the Camel Humidor Pack.
Try Camels freshness for a change. Switch over 
for just one day, then change back  if you can.

Welcome Duquesne
Carnegie welcomes Duquesne University to its 1931 foot
ball schedule, and is quite pleased that the initial gridiron 
encounter between these two neighbors is to conic in the 
interest of the needy, of the communities which these insti
tutions serve.In arrangingto meet Duquesne both on the basketball 
court and on the gridiron for the firvst time this year, Carnegie has acted in the best interest _ of-the sport, and has 
secured a worthy opponent in addition to a natural rival. 
Full recognition of the improved quality of the Duquesne teams has been accorded the school in being placed on the 
schedules of both of its. larger city rivals. We wish the 
Dukes the best of luck, and welcome the attempt at a more 
representative intra-city competition. KSaturdays Charity Game
Next Saturday in the Stadium, Carnegie will stage a football game with Duquesne in a-sincere'attempt to raise funds 
to alleviate the plight of the unfortunates of this district. 
The student body at Carnegie, whose response to the Wel
fare Drive contributions was but slight, is asked to aid in making this contest a success, as Regards the present emer
gency. : Within the space of two weeks during this month hun
dreds of charity games are being played all over the coun
try, in response to the call from Owen D. Young, the spokesman of the President. This nation-wide post-season 
is something absolutely new in the history of the game and is tremendously significant. Everyone is co-operating to 
the fullest extent; officials donating their services; busi
ness men purchasing blocks of tickets, football players and sports writers buying tickets to their games,;all in order 
that every cent secured from the public will apply directly 
to the unemployment relief.Of importance is the methodby'which the students of 
. this school can do their bit for the needy. Their attend"ance alone will not total much in the general fund. The 
game must be generously patronised by'the friends of the students and the general public in order to fulfill their pur
pose. Those unable to attend the game, or fearful of bad weather, can back the movement by buying tickets regard* 
less. Every cent spent for admission will reach the hungry 
and destitute, and through an intelligent organization for 
relief.In addition those that do attend the game will be assured of a good exhibition and a game played in a different 
atmosphere from the regular season encounters. There will 
be no championship at stake and the tense seriousness that often prevents a football game from being a purely sport
ing event will be eliminated. A more daring game, with 
unusual formations and strategy not attempted in a regular season contest, should mark the game , as something new 
and not just another football game.
Should the element of the unusual about the coming game not reach the public the attendance is bound to be 
disappointing and the receipts arfe bound to fall far short of what those who are carrying the responsibility of collect
ing relief funds are expecting and are relying upon.Doubtless many arc opposed to post-season games or 
benefit games and feel that they are not in the interest of 
football. In fact the recent meeting of the university professors has gone on'record as opposing any games which 
lengthen the season and further interfere with the .players 
studies. While such opinions are perhaps correct, the fact that the present emergency is so extreme, and also the 
wholehearted action of the players in offering their time, surely justifies the special attempt. K.
Rushing Rules and Penalties
Despite a decided opinion last year against the rule in the Interfraternity Rushing Rules, which states that in case 
a fraternity is found guilty of an infraction in its rushing 
it may not pledge the person concerned, this year finds the rule continued.
Perhaps the new Council is not familiar with the hardship which such a rule might work upon a rushee who is 
greatly concerned about making a certain fraternity and then finds himself barred for a year because of some illadvised action by an over-zealous .fraternity man. When it has come to a showdown in thepast and the rushee 
shown to be innocent, as is always the case, the Council., 
has waived its by-laws and permitted the man to make his choice.
Unless an extraordinary season is.to. be conducted this 
year doubtless some similar case, will, arise again. Will not 
the Council soon realize that only through the medium of i heavy fine can a fair penalty be enacted that will not 
injure an innocent party? This years group would do 
well to again waive the portion of the by-laws ' affecting 
the rushees, and to increase the amount of the fine levied on the fraternity found guilty of a violation. K.

AFamousFeud Carnegie vs.Frick
Editors Note: To the majority of students at this school the name Andrew Carnegie is but a legend, a symbol for unprecedented charity, and a name made famous as a steel-baron. New and interesting insights into this mans personal life arc appearing in his latter day biographies. The following story taken from an article by Forrest Davis# of the New York Telegram and the newbook by John K. Winkler titled Incredible Carnegie, reveals the story of the famous feud between Carnegie and the other great steelmaker. Henry Clay Frick.
Andrew Carnegie, the outstand
ing owner in the steel industry at* 
the start of, the twentieth century 
was closely allied in business with 
Henry Clay Frick, the coal oper
ator and steel-maker. When but 
new in the game they had become 
associated and together these strug
gling titans had shaken the steel 
heavens, showering millions;.* upon 
themselves, arid upon the lesser 
steel-mongers. Their relations 
after twelve years of prosperity 
and ever increasing number of tiffs, 
wore, thin under the strain of 
Fricks chaffing under the mastery 
of Carnegie.
When in the winter of 1900, Car
negie returned from his 40,000 acre 
Scottish estate,' Skibo, with its 
forty guest suites, yachts, golf 
courses, salmon run, deer forests 
and $50,000 organ which awoke 
the household at 8 a. m. every day, 
he returned to do business with 
Frick. Carnegie was majority own
er of the giant steel works of the 
Pittsburgh district, and Frick the 
chairman of the board. Carnegie 
callcd upon Frick one January 
morning supposedly to settle the 
price of coke, a commodity con
trolled by Frick. Instead of bother
ing about this errand Carnegie pro
posed the real reason for his visit. 
He suggested that Mr. Frick with-, 
draw from the company, selling his 
stock at book value under the in
genious arrangement devised by 
I Carnegie to evict partners as he 
j so desired. The book value of the 
i stock held by Frick in Carnegie 
] Steel Company was nearly $5,000,-
000 while its actual value was three 
or four times greater.
In( describing the . scene, George 
Harvey, author of a biography of 
Frick recounts the affair.
. The colloquy had been carried 
on thus far, by Mr. Frick in nota
bly distinct but even tones, by Mr. 
Carnegie toward the end impatient
ly. There was nothing more to be 
said  by way of explanation. The 
case was closed, the verdict ren
dered. Mr. Frick looked long and 
intently into Mr. Carnegies defiant 
eyes, while, one cannot doubt, the 
steel was creeping slowly into his 
own. /
"Then .speaking still evenly but 
with steadily rising inflection/his 
anger, writes Mr. Bridge in his 
history of the Carnegie SteelCom
pany, ..burstinto flame, and his 
pent-up indignation was finding full 
vent when Mr. Carnegie, who had 
been edging toward the door, sud
denly hastened his steps and dash
ed, into the hall, closely followed 
by Mr. Frick.
Another author, the late Senator 
Philander C. Knox, a one time 
Secretary of State, recalled the 
ludricrous scene more vividly.
The white whiskers of the 
Scotch iron-master. sang like the 
needles ori the barrel of a music 
box, Kriox reported, "in the 
breeze made by Carnegies energy 
in seeking a place where Frick 
was not.
In the . woiMs of Forrest Davis, 
feature writer for the New York 
World-Telcgram,The thumping 
ruckus between Andrew Carnegie, 
r,oIy-poly Scotch dcii, and H. C. 
Frick, pile-driving.- steel-maker and 
labor-buster, took its* rise from a 
ribald* personal encounter. It in
directly fashioned the greatest of 
trusts, showered millions on the 
feudists and lesser steel-makers and 
endured into the next \Vorld which 
neither feared.
Frick, unforgiving, 4iard-bittcn,
it soured. The fucd classic drove 
Frick into school boy emulation of 
his buoyant, master in the unrelated 
fields of Fifth Avenue mansions, 
culture and Pittsburgh skyscrapers,
But if Uncle Andy, ostensibly 
friend of mankind, pawky laird of 
Skibo, suffered from the violent 
-estrangement he displayed 
scars.
The suit brought ' by Frick to 
collect the full value of his equity 
was happily compromised in the 
famous Atlantic City conference, 
the following March, when the 
Frick and Carnegie corporations 
merged, forming a gigantic steel 
trust. The law suit was closed 
soon enough however, to prevent 
the radicals and. dispossesed ele
ments in the country from learn
ing, that the Carnegie steel barons 
were to make a profit of $40,000,- 
000, in the current year on a capi
talization of but $25,000,000.
Carnegie soon decided to with
draw from active business and 
secure the peaceful life of a benev
olent squire. He jockeyed Morgan 
into buying his interest for a sum 
of $300,000,000. Frick withdrew re
ceiving a total of $60,000,000.
Out of'.the .steel business, Frick 
turned' to finance and a life-long 
hatred. He retained the fury of 
liis wrath. His cold eyes gleamed 
icily at the mention of Carnegie 
and lie silenced underlings . who 
spoke the detested consonants. His 
metabolism gradually decreased and 
lie was taken to bed with cramps.
Carnegie turned to patronizing 
music, b6oks and practical learn
ing, and startled the world with 
his philantropies. He became a 
friend of the hones)- workingman 
and many a speech of his attacted 
the intense working conditions in 
the steel mills. He built libraries, 
church organs, subsidized educa
tion and enjoyed the life which he 
had dedicated to doing good for 
mankind and then dying poor.
Frick became a patron of the 
picture ' galleries and secured 
collection second to none in his 
time. His jealousy over the evi
dences of Carnegies wealth knew 
no bounds. lie erected a twentyfour story office building in Pitts
burgh to dwarf Carnegies twelvestory building iri the same block, 
and then established an annex to 
his office building on one side and 
a hotel on the other side in order 
to blanket Carnegies holdings. Ill 
make that one look like a bake 
oven, said Frick. The press com
mented on the spite building and 
became superstitious of its future.
When Carnegie built a fulsome 
mansion on Fifth Avenue in New 
York, Frick, tormented by his 
jealousy and taunted by mischiev
ous frierids, set about, "to make 
that house look like a miners 
shack." Pie built a $5,000,000 home, 
a sensous Florentine mansion with 
art galleries, and museums. This 
home is now the museum of the 
New York art.
-"The implacable Frick continued 
as Davis records It, humorless, just, 
after hislights; ruthlessly breaking 
the strike of the ragged, violent 
Homestead mill hands; overpower
ing the nervous homicide Alexander 
Berkman, anarchist; greedily buy
ing the old masters, ("I can make 
money, but I can't make pictures) 
and refused Uncle Andys amends 
to the end.
Winkler tells of the attempt of 
Carnegie to carry the olive branch 
to Frick, through a mutual friend. 
"The usually impcrturable Frick ex
ploded. His eyes narrowed. His 
lips drew back into a half snarl. 
,Tell your friend, Carnegie, lie 
grated, that I will see him in hell, 
where we arc both going.
Originally warm friends, Frick 
and Carnegie died estranged in the 
same year. The implacable Frick 
outlived the Scotch steel-master by 
four months. Carnegie died in 
August 1919; Frick in December.
University of North Carolina
Not to let the co:eds at this 
school outdo them in returning to 
old styles by' the donning of Eu

dents have formed an anti-shaver 
club and arc growing Van Dykes, 
long sideburns and Franz Joseph 
mustaches.
University of Michigan  Stu

outsiders crashing classes.
Ball State Teachers. CollegeA
home economics class conducted 
an endurance contest in hose 
wearing at Ball State Teachers 
College. On investigation it was 
found that some girls could wear 
a pair of hose only one week, 
while others require eight to' twen
ty-five pairs each year. This is a 
good experiment to give during 
the time of depression, so hfcrcs 
to your hose, girls, long may they 
wear.
University of ChicagoA new

CONTRIBS
THE FIGHTING SCOTCHMEN
Carn.egic followers have mani
fested great pride in its 1931 foot
ball team, which has earned a name 
for itself by its gallant, fighting in 
the face of defeat and unlucky 
breaks. That this pride is not 
misplaced is affirmed by the re
marks of sports writers of the big 
city newspapers. A few of these 
arc quoted:
Philadelphia Public Ledger: 
Carnegie doesnt play a conser
vative game on the attack and the 
unusual plays keep the opponents 
gucssiri. . . . Pitt, is considered 
to be oiic of the very high rank
ing teams of the East. Carnegie 
stopped the Panthers  on the 
ground and outscored them in 
downs. . . . The Skibos held 
Nolte Dame scoreless in the sec-, 
ond half, although the Irish' play
ed their first team throughout al
most all of the fourth period. . . 
Having seen the South Benders, I 
offer Carnegies second-half show
ing against them as convincing 
.evidence that Wally Steffens club 
is no pushover for any opponent. 
Ed. Pollock.
New York Times:
"The Tartan has lost a ^number 
of games this season, but a team 
can sometimes make a stronger 
iiriprcssion in defeat than in vic
tory, and certainly Carnegie looked 
anything but weak in holding Pitt 
to 14-6,and Notre Dame l9-0,- 
Allison Danzig.
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:
"Aside from the Army game 
here, there will be more "color 
aU the Tech-Dukc game than any 
other this season. Carnegies great 
stand against New York U docs 
not augur well for Duciucsnc suc
cess next Saturday.Ilavcy J. 
Boyle.
The Pittsburgh Press:
"For the sort of couragc and re
fusal to bow under adversity, which 
is ever admirable, Captain Armcntrouts squad will rank with any 
the Plaid has turned out.Ches
ter L. Smith.
With Coach WallySteffen plan
ning to retire from1 coaching at 
Carnegie this year, it is regretted 
that a more perfect record for the 
season docs not mark his passing. 
It is evident from the above, quo
tations that the team has given its 
best. It is in the development of 
the splendid spirit of the players, 
that our coach should doubtless 
feel some pride and in the molding 
of men with characters. The com
muting system in vogue at Car
negie as regards her head coach 
is doubtless unsatisfactory to both 
parties as it is essentially an im
practical plan. Coach Stettin has 
a great record and will be accorded 
fitting tribute when he retires, but 
sentimentality in the passing of a 
great-man must not rulo in looking 
to the best interests of the school. 
A revamped coaching staff should 
be secured that is complete in 
each necessary branch and has 
neither business nor public office 
competing for its time, N.
BATTLE RAGES
(Continued from Page One) 
the rest of them began research 
work on the subject preparatory 
to a dignified debate on "Resolved, 
That the co-eds of the University 
of Utah should adopt the 50-50 
plan of dating for the year 1931-32 
in the school Assembly, with a 
silver loving cup offered to the 
winner. Curiously enough, the 
affirmative was upheld by a group 
of co-eds.
A writer in Northwestern Uni
versitys Daily grows caustic over 
the subject. Says he to the girls: 
"If you think lie ought to pay for 
you, then you arc not 'the kind of 
women lie should be withif he 
has to sacrifice to take you out.
