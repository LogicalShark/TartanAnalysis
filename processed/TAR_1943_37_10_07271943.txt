ACAC Asks for Student 
Opinion On Dropping 
Of Army-Civilian Sport
Last Thursday at the ACAC meet
ing a report was read from the 
Physical Education Department re
questing that intramural sports be
tween soldiers and civilians be 
dropped for the coming semester |
Next semester all intramural 
games will be contact sports such 
as touch football. The Physical Edu
cation Department feels that the 
present Carnegie Students, most of 
whom are eighteen years old, are 
too young and too light for Army 
competition. There has also been 
some complaint about intramural 
sports interfering with the ASTP 
educational program.
It has been suggested that Army 
and civilian teams play in separate 
leagues, but the final decision de
pends on the sentiments of the stu
dent body. For this reason it will be 
important for all Tech students to 
relay their feelings to the ACAC 
members so that the intramural 
athletic program will be adopted.
Notice
Bob Redelfs, manager of the Mens 
Glee Club, has announced that there 
are still openings in the different sec
tions of the Glee Club. Any student, 
especially the newly arrived A.S.T.P. 
men, who is interested is asked to 
come to rehearsal Monday or Wed
nesday at 5:00 oclock for tryouts. 
The rehearsal is held in Margaret 
Morrison Building.
Three Tech WAVES 
Celebrate Birthday
When the WAVES celebrate their 
first birthday on July 30, three Tech 
graduates who are going to be of
ficer candidates will join in the par
ties. These girls who will leave for 
the Naval Training School for Of
ficer Candidates at Northampton on 
the 31st are Florence Catherine Mc
Laughlin, 28; Ruth Elizabeth Sayre, 
40; and Marjorie Ann Weatherwax, 
43.
The Business and Professional 
Womens Association will give a 
luncheon at the William Penn for 
the WAVES in this district on the 
afternoon of the 30th. That evening 
the AWVS is having a ball in the 
William Penn Ballroom for all the 
friends of the Navy. The officer can
didates and their escorts will also be 
guests at this affair. At the ball there 
is to be a birthday cake baked by a 
chef especially sent from New York 
to make it. Commander and Mrs. 
Lynch of the local Navy office will 
lead the Grand March. All the 
friends of the Navy in the Pitts
burgh district are invited to the 
birthday dance; the admission 
charge is $1.10.
Swimming
Until August 9 the swimming pool 
will be open for mixed swimming for 
faculty, administration, and students 
from 12:00 Noon to 1:30 P. M., Mon
day through Friday. There will be 
a life guard in attendance.
Company B Presents 
Social Committee Plan
Because they feel there is a lack 
of social functions provided for the 
Tech army students, the members 
of Company B last week drew up a 
constitution for a social committee 
which has been accepted with revi
sion by ACAC.
The Constitution provides for a 
committee of eight men whose main 
duties are to arrange dances for the 
Company, set up a date bureau, and 
plan for picnics and other entertain
ment. Company A is drawing up a 
similar constitution and the other 
companies will probably follow 
suit.
The present members of the Com
pany B committee, headed by Mike 
Gingold, will hold office until a com
mittee is elected (from the other 
men). The new committee and all 
succeeding ones will be in office for 
the duration of a twelve-week 
ASTP semester.
The committee also provides in 
their constitution that all the money 
raised by Company B social affairs 
will be used for Company B. This 
money will be used to buy athletic 
equipment for the group, phono
graph records, and other types of 
recreational facilities.
Since there are five platoons to 
a company, membership will con
sist of at least one man from each 
platoon. The remaining three men 
will be chosen from any of the pla
toons. In that way the committee 
will be composed of at least five 
men, but not more than eight.

Your Contributions 
Provide Scholarships
While you, dear reader, are scan
ning the contents of this paper, 
there is probably a desperate, wild
eyed young woman standing behind 
you, waiting for you to turn 
around. Immediately she will 
thrust a little American flag into 
your hand; and before you have a 
chance to regain your composure, 
she will breathlessly ask you for a 
silver contribution. Dear reader, 
do not be dismayed. Do not yell for 
Dean Murphy, the football team, or 
Colonel Bass to rescue you. It wont 
do any good at all. You see, poor un
fortunate, they too have been ac
costed. This is the day that Wom
ens Guild goes on its annual spree. 
Yes, this is TAG DAY. This is the 
day on which everyone on Tech 
campus should be displaying a lit
tle flag. If he isnt, he is complete
ly out of step, is a non-comformist; 
in short, doesnt rate.
Womens Guild is an organization 
of Tech women whose aim is to pro
vide scholarships for needy and de
serving women students. Scholar
ships mean money, and money 
means student support. The Guild 
sponsors an annual dance, but too 
many Tech students are stay-athomes: hence, TAG DAY. BUY A 
TAG!
Gobs Go For Tech Glamour Girl; 
Helena Seamen Honor Rea Simon
The oft-repeated complaint of 
Carnegie men to the effect that 
97% of the American girls are 
pretty; the other 3% come to Tech 
is definitely not shared by th sail
ors of the recently sunk cruiser, the 
U. S. S. Helena. Rea Simon, a Car
negie Household Ec. student, re
cently received a letter from Sea
man First Class Eroll Cantlin of the 
Helena, in which he informed her 
that she had been elected queen 
of his ship. The chain of events 
leading up to this choice is rather 
obscure, but it seems that through 
devious means the men of the 
Helena obtained a copy of the 
May Queen edition of the SCOTTIE. In this edition there appeared 
the pictures of seven candidates for 
the title of May Queen. Besides 
Rea, the candidates were Marge 
Maddox, Martha Sekey, Peggy Cole, 
Helen Robinson, Gladys Mattson, 
and Janie Swearer.
The winner, selected by Holly
wood director and former Carnegie 
student Robert Cummings, was Miss 
Maddox. The sailors of the Helena, 
however, did not agree with Mister
Cummings decision and selected 
Miss Simon as their queen.
Seaman Cantlins letter was dat
ed July 2, just three days before the
Pin-up girl oj the Helena
9,700 ton Helena was sunk by Jap 
torpedoes in the battle of Kula Gulf.

The ever growing military staff 
here at Carnegie Tech gained four 
new officers last week. These of
ficers, namely First Lieutenant 
Thomas, and Second Lieutenants 
Lester, Dyer, and Courtney, are 
needed to keep the fast enlarging 
ASTP working properly.
Lieutenant Thomas arrived last 
Monday to assume command of 
Company E which has not yet been 
formed. He comes from a small 
town fifty miles south of Minneap
olis, Minnesota, joined the Army in 
March, 1942, as a Second Lieuten
ant; a rank he attained through his 
service in the Civilian Military
Training Corps. Before going over
seas to the South Pacific war zone, 
however,' he became First Lieu
tenant Thomas; because he con
tracted malaria during his stay
there, he was returned to the
States.
Lieutenants Dyer, Lester, and 
Courtney are on the administrative 
staff. They arrived last Saturday 
from Officers Training School at 
Grinnel, Iowa, where they received 
their Second Lieutenant commis
sions.
Lieutenant Dyer left New York 
City and a job as purchasing agent 
for an oil refinery construction com
pany when he joined the Army in 
July, 1942. He received his Bach
elor of Arts in Philosophy from 
Tufts College, Medford, Massa
chusetts and is the officer in charge 
of Supply and Transportation on the 
military staff at Carnegie.
Lieutenant Lester is second in 
command of Company D. He comes 
from Dennison, Iowa, and has been 
in the Army since September, 1942. 
Lieutenant Courtney, acting Assist
ant Adjutant attached to the Head
quarters Staff here at Tech, joined 
the Army at Chicago, Illinois, in 
October, 1942.
Get Hep! Summer 
Session To End Soon
Have you noticed the increased 
restlessness among Techites, the 
gradual slackening down in their 
studies, the increasing number of 
cuts,
We cant blame this on the forth
coming stage show at the Stanley 
or the promise of a second front; 
the most logical answer to this un
usual behavior is the fact that edu
cation at Tech will be momentarily 
halted by the ending of the semes
ter on August 21 (we think). The 
misses of Maggie Murph can for
get Guild and economics, the P&Ds 
a* the art school can claim a tem
porary intermission and the engi
neers can cast aside their slide rules

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JULY 27, 1943
diio^L Anmckaisi
In line with our policy of trying to give the students as much of the 
news as we can gather, we started out this week by trying to dig up the 
facts on the current bone of contention: whether the week of August 16-21 
is to be a regular school week, an examination period, or a vacation.
Almost every civilian was rather perturbed because he had gone to 
classes on his scheduled vacation days, May 31 and July 5, along with the 
ASTP students, who had been required to attend on those days. It seem
ed like adding insult to injury for the powers-that-be to hand the Army 
boys an 8-day furlough and give the civilians only 5 days of vacation. We 
certainly admit that the primary reason for attending college is to gain an 
education, but we also felt that a slight vacation might refresh the civilian 
students, too, and pep up their morale for next semester.
Our first stop in our search for information was at the office of our 
chief guide and pal, Max Hannum. Max reasoned that since the Execu
tive Board handled all affairs of this kind, we should go to see Dean War
den, the secretary of the Executive Board. But Dean Warden could tell us 
nothing that was definite, other than pointing out on his calendar that 
classes were scheduled up to August 13 and that Final Exam Week had 
been set for the week of August 16 to 21. Then he showed us a ruling of 
the Executive Board (which we later copied from the Faculty Bulletin of 
June 23):
Due to the lack of space caused by the fact that the ASTP will be 
holding regular class sessions at the time final examination periods were 
provided for civilian students, the Executive Board has voted that final 
examinations be given during the regular class periods from August 16 
to 21, 1943.
From these two sources we came to the conclusion that this would 
mean that the regularly scheduled classes would be completed by August 
13 and that any teacher desiring final examinations would schedule them 
during what would ordinarily be class hours in the week of the 16th to 
21st. But it scarcely seemed to mean that the periods of instruction 
would be extended for an extra week if no examination was to be given 
in a course. In most courses the instruction is so well arranged that every
thing would be covered by the last class day, the 13th. With these ideas 
to go on, we continued our quest.
Our next stop was the Department of Humanistic and Social Studies. 
Those professors, we had heard, had been left to decide for themselves 
whether or not to hold classes during the disputed week. There we gain
ed little information other than that its head, Dr. Hotchkiss, preferred to 
be lenient in the matter of detail, and allow his co-workers to interpret the 
ambiguous statement as best they could. We were sent to Mr. Collins. 
He, however, was absent, and we were referred to Mr. McKelway who is 
in charge of all school scheduling. He felt that inasmuch as this was a 
regular week of school, there was no reason why instructors couldnt do 
as they please with it.
With this we threw in the sponge. We had followed the passing buck 
from pillar to post. We found that our bone of contention was deeply 
buried and wrapped in yards of red tape. The faculty is not only unhappy 
over the fact that they can have no resthaving to teach civilians during 
the ASTP furlough and soldiers during the student five-day vacation 
but they are hopelessly confused by the different interpretations that can 
be gleaned from the ambiguous statement of the Executive Board. We 
see no reason for this indefinite state of affairs, when a definite statement 
by the Administration could have prevented all of this confusion. Lets 
hope that in the future we may depend on the Scheduling Committee to 
stipulate clearly when our classes will be held, and then that we may be 
allowed to follow their rulings unhampered.

to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

Editors Note:
And we havent heard the worst of this. Not only do the civilians heckle 
the Army and vice versa, but we are flabbergasted by the feud between the 
Army boys in basic training and those in the advanced training, the overqualifieds. If all this jealousy is running riot in a peaceful place like Tech, 
we are wondering what will happen when these boys are under actual fire. 
Lets get down to the fact that we are all in this together and each of us 
should realize the worth of the other and stop this silly quibbling!

Dear Editor:
I am not an A. S. T. P. man fran
tically trying to crowd in college ed
ucation with military training. 
Neither am I a male civilian stu
dent who is racing his studies 
against time and the draft board. I 
am an expedited Maggie Murphy, 
and instead of lounging at the sea
shore, I am spending my summer 
pounding the books. When I first 
heard that soldiers were to arrive on 
campus, I, like every other Tech co
ed, was thrilled. What an exciting 
place Tech will be, I thoughta mil
itary camp with a collegiate at
mosphere.
But there is one thing I definitely 
do not like. That is the petty bat
tle of words that is being waged in 
this column every week. One week 
Private So and So says this, the next 
week Mr. Whats His Name says 
that. Should soldiers play on Tech 
teams? Are A. S. T. P. men more 
valuable than civilians? 
Do you think, Mr. A. S. T. P., that 
when you are fighting for your life 
in some remote country, that your 
CO is going to give one snap of his 
fingers whether or not you played in 
the Pitt-Tech game? And you, Mr. 
Civilian, is it really so terribly nec
essary to have a football team? I 
have sat through three seasons of 
Techs football games, and it seems 
to me that a lot of jangled nerves on 
the part of the girls and broken

Eleventh Meeting 
July 22, 1943 
The meeting was called to order at 
5:15 p.m.
Present: Messrs. Fairchild, Futchik,
Noyes, Peterson, and Sher; Misses Beall, 
Rial, and Bloom; and Mrs. Marshall. 
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Social
Miss Rial moved that ACAC accept the 
petition of the Womens Guild for per
mission to have a Tag Day on Tuesday, 
July 27.
Motion carried.
Publications
Mr. Noyes reported that the Publica
tions Committee had selected Mr. Bernard 
Marcus as ASTP representative to ACAC, 
subject to approval of Colonel Bass.
Mr. Noyes moved that his resignation 
as Publications representative on ACAC 
be accepted and that he be succeeded by 
Mr. Merle Wolff.
Motion carried.
Special Committee
Mrs. Marshall reported that notice of 
the date of freshman traditions examina
tions had been published in the TARTAN. 
OLD BUSINESS
Mr. Murphy reported that athletic 
schedules had been checked to determine 
the availability of soft-ball fields. Until 
August 9 the fields on the Cut will be 
available on Mondays and Tuesdays from 
1:00 to 4:00 p.m. These same fields are 
open all day Saturday, with the excep
tion of two Saturdays when twofields 
will be in use. Permission must be se
cured from Mr. Moses; such permission 
is final. Availability of shower rooms 
no longer offer any problem as civilians 
are now admitted at any time.
It was decided that the constitution 
of Company B should be returned to 
them with suggestions for changes.
NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Peterson submitted a suggestion 
from the Physical Education Department 
that intramural sports between Army 
and Civilian students be discontinued for 
the coming semester for two reasons: (1)
arms on the part of th players 
could be saved 
But the main issue seems to be 
whether we are going to extend a 
welcome and helping hand to the 
soldiers. Or whether we are going 
to have to listen to more disgruntled 
male students complain that the 
Army has taken their place on cam
pus. You civilians are not really so 
unlucky as you would lead us to be
lieve; you still have your school ac
tivities, your favorite profs, your 
places to study, and your places to 
loaf. And no one thinks that you 
are not doing your part; but if you 
continue to harp on the fact that 
you are valuable, we shall soon be
gin to wonder. '
Im not saying that you have to 
rush up to every A. S. T. P. man 
and call him your brother. But lets 
see a little more cooperation be
tween the two groups on campus. 
Remember, were all working to 
win the war.
NAOMI ELLMAN.

for six glorious days (we think).
The summer session has been a 
new experience to most Carnegie 
Tech students and not especially an 
unpleasant one. Having previously 
spent the summer period vacation

whether or not Seaman Cantlin was

Seamon Cantlin, in his letter, also 
complimented Rea upon her hair-do 
which he termed a little bit of all 
right. Most of us, after examining 
Reas picture are inclined to agree 
with the navys judgment, although 
Robert Cummings knows beauty 
when he sees it. Were willing to 
call it a draw between Marge and

back in your corner and be satisfied 
with the Maggie Murphs and dramats: Theyre good enough for the 
navy.

the Army physical education program 
and (2) because most of the civilian stu
dents are too young and too light for 
Army competition in contact sports such 
as touch football. It was decided that 
ACAC should attempt to find out 
through the TARTAN, personal conversa
tions, and letters to the fraternities, dor
mitories, and the Citcom Clanhow civil
ian students feel toward intramural com

If you happen to see a concentrat
ed bundle of efficiency in a package 
about 5T high dashing toward 
Maggie Murph with blue eyes posi
tively fired with determination, you 
are seeing Sally Moir Marshall in 
action. This tiny secretarial really 
seems to thrive on workthe more 
she has to do, the more efficiently 
she gets it done. But this summer 
she is really outdoing herselfas 
vice president of the Senate she is 
representing Margaret Morrison on 
AC AC this semester; she is public
ity chairman of Womens Guild and 
is on Mortar Board. Being vice pres
ident of her sorority, Kappa Phi 
Delta, makes her that organizations 
social and rushing chairman. But 
she is used to being busy. When 
she was a freshman she was presi
dent of her class; the next year she 
was a Cwen and sophomore repre
sentative on Senate; in her junior 
year she was Assistant Secretary of 
Student Council.
And she keeps house. On May 10
 registration day  Sally married 
Matthew Marshall, USNR, who is 
a medical student at Pitt. Besides 
getting married that day, she came 
out to school to registershe really 
can get a lot accomplished in one

apartment in the Pennsylvania 
where each of their families happen 
to have apartments too. Sally eats 
breakfast at her mothers so she 
wont wake her husband when she 
has to leave early enough to make 
an eight oclock. Their home is fur

belonged to her grandmother. She 
loves everything about housekeep

It was in a California night club not 
so very long ago that George Olson 
tried to persuade her to enter a jit
terbug contest, but Sally wasnt 
having any of it. When he tried to 
drag her onto the floor, she got her 
first taste of what celebrities can be 
likeshe bit Olson. Her chasing 
back and forth to the coast has made 
an interesting thing of her school 
career; she was in thirteen different 
schools before she came to Tech. 
The only changing that she has done 
in Tech was switching from being a 
teacher training to being a straight 
secretarial after she was married.
Besides collecting antiques for her 
apartment, she collects dolls and In
dian bracelets which she wears ten 
at a time. The dolls in her collec
tion have come from all over the 
world. Although you wouldnt know 
it to look at her this very very small 
person eats chocolate ice cream 
every day of her life. As for things 
that make life worth-while  for 
Sally there are Bacardis, historical 
novels and Andre Kostelanetz. The 
something blue at her wedding was 
the wedding dress because blue is 
her favorite color.
Private Bernard Marcus has just 
been selected as publications rep
resentative on ACAC, and there is 
no one I can think of who is as well 
qualified for the job. Bernie was 
one of the first ASTP men to join 
the TARTAN staff, and many 
articles by him have appeared in 
our issues. To write is one of 
Bernies favorite pastimes, but to 
be the subject of an interview seems 
to be his pet peeve. However, when 
he made his usual Friday night ap
pearance at the Tartan office, I 
backed him into a corner and 
eventually convinced him that my 
assignment was to find out the de
tails of his life, and I intended to get 
them. (It was like extracting blood 
from a turnip).
Bernie first saw the light of day 
nineteen years ago, and ever since 
that time he has constantly been 
on the alert for pretty girls and 
Canadian whiskey. Each pay day 
he attempts to find sufficient time 
to quench his thirst with a tall 
frosted glass filled to the brim with 
his favorite liquor, but as pay days 
are few and far between, he ac
cepts as an unsatisfactory substi
tute plain beer. As an afterthought 
on the subject of refreshing bev
erages he commented, Carnegie is 
quite a haven for any soldier desir
ing very nice coeds as companions.
Although Bernie regards the 
ASTP program as a great oppor
tunity, it does not represent his 
first taste of college life. Before en
tering the army, he was a consci
entious pre-law student at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania; but he 
found sufficient time to participate 
in many school activities. His lust 
for writing asserted itself early in 
his college career and prompted him
to join the school newspaper, and 
throughout his days at Penn he was 
active on publications. Consider
ing Bernies great reluctance to be 
interviewed, it was quite a shock to 
me to learn that his second hobby 
is drama. Bernie would never wow 
an uncompromising group of re
nowned drama critics, but he had a 
hell of a good time as a member of 
the Penn Players.
One would think that school work, 
writing, drama, and women (he re
fuses to forget the women) would 
have occupied all of his available 
time. Nevertheless, he was able to 
participate in his three favorite 
forms of athletics: tennis, swim
ming, and basketball. Most of Car
negies sleepless wonders would 
have a hard time matching a pro
gram like that.
As a member of the ASTP, Ber
nies spare time is very limited; but 
he still finds time to take part in 
some extra-curricular activities. As 
I have already mentioned, he is a 
member of the Tartan staff and will 
shortly assume a position on ACAC. 
In addition, he has participated in 
several intramural tennis matches. 
Like most soldiers, Bernie has paid 
a visit to Pittsburghs renowned Can
teen. Its really swell, he com
mented, the feature attractions be
ing the very pretty girls and the ex
cellent reading room. (Quite a con
trast). At this writing his favorite 
of all pastimes is checking off the 
days on the calendar.

In order to augment the circula

magazine Esquire (yes, we are kid
ding) we devote this weeks column 
entirely to Espys Vitticism.
First a little unwishful thinking 
by Parke Cummings: READY,
GIRLS? (with the draft age lower
ed to eighteen many authorities be
lieve there will be no intercollegiate 
football next fall) Good-afternoon, 
ladies and gentlemen, here we are at 
the Yankee Stadium for the game 
of the year in the East, the field 
hockey game between Smith and 
Vassar. Both of them are undefeat

last week Gean Baber was coking 
with her partner after a hard tennis

the tennis player beat a hasty exit. 
However, Whiteys time ran out and 
so did he. The grill door made one 
complete revolution as Whitey left 
and the tennis man re-entered to 
take his place by Gean.
Incident of the Week: Billie McIlrath decided to become engaged 
last week, and for lack of an immi

10c and the incidental carfare Billie 
bought a ring for the third, left 
hand. For two days the boys wished 
her the very best, the girls ohed 
and ahed as Billie flashed her 
dime item. But little Becky wanted 
to be engaged too, so she borrowed 
Billies ring and lo and behold! the

Nelesen Is Defeated 
In Tournament; Other 
Seeded Stars Advance
A major upset was recorded in 
the All-School Tennis Tournament 
last week as A1 Nelesen, seeded 
number two in the singles division, 
was defeated by Leon Forman, 6-4, 
6-4. No other casualties occurred 
during the week as the tournament 
entered its final stages.
Two of the players entered the 
semi-final round. Top-seeded Frank 
Showman disposed of Gail Litton, 
6-0, 6-2, and Monroe Munsell, 6-2,
5-7, 6-1, to enter the coveted bracket 
along with Bill Lankford, who de
feated Buzzy Greenberg, 6-2, 6-0. 
Jack Hugus, seeded number four in 
the tourney, continued in his win
ning ways by downing L. P. Barker,
OAKDALE 
MINING CO.
OAKDALE, 
PA.
6-1, 6-1. In other matches played 
last week Bill Wolfe defeated Larry 
Shutzer, 6-0, 6-0, and Bill Griffen 
downed Grant Cavendar, 6-0, 6-0.
Two matches were played in the 
doubles division last week. The sec
ond seeded team of Lankford and 
Hugus defeated the Munsell-Dunn 
combination, 10-8, 6-3, to advance to 
the semi-final round. In the other 
match, Moses and Owens defeated 
Yeakel and Lyman, 6-2, 6-2. The 
feature match scheduled for this 
week has the number one seeded 
combination of Nelesen and Show
man pitted against Wolfe and Grif
fen.
One of the longest matches in the 
history of Carnegie Techs tennis 
was played last week in the mixed 
doubles division. The unbelievable 
total of 48 games was played in the 
two set match in which Frank Show
man and Tassie Truxell defeated 
Bill Griffen and Gean Baber, 16-14, 
10-8. The feature attraction this

First Platoon of Co. A Again 
On Top of The Second League
In contrast to last weeks rapid 
developments, the league standings 
remained relatively stable this 
week; the only exceptions being 
A-3s remarkable jump from third 
to first place in league III and the 
A-4s pulling ahead of the Tau Delts. 
The powerful A-l team, led by hurler Steve Gaza, swept all opposition 
before it, winning its fifth straight 
game of this round, to lead league II 
with the whopping percentage of 
.1000. In league III a general reshufflling of league leaders resulted 
in A-3s coming out on the top of 
the heap.
The rampaging A-ls defeated the 
PiKAs; the final score being 3-1. 
This game was a heartbreaker; the 
PiKAs, unable to score after the 
first inning, helplessly watched the 
Army boys nose them out. The A-2 
team holds the weeks record for 
hits. They slugged out 16 hits to 
beat the Betas, 16 to 6. Paul Wood
land of the Army held the Betas to 
13 hits. Brooklyn Benko of A-3 
allowed the Tau Delts only 2 hits to 
help his hard-hitting team to a 
crushing 12-4 victory. The A-4 team 
walloped the Delts 14-2 by batting 
out 17 hits to the Delts 6.
Tuesdays games were cancelled 
because of rain. Wednesday, Paul 
Woodland of the A-2s led his team 
to their second win of the week by 
holding the SAEs to two hits. The 
A-2s knocked out 9 hits to win 12-2. 
An Army team lost a game Wed
nesday, but only to another Army 
team. The A-4s vanquished the 
B-5s; 9-3. Fred Wunderlich of the 
A-4s held the strong opposition to 
four hits, a good job. The A-l team 
kept on the ball by taking over B-3;
3-1. This was the second win of the 
week for A-l. B-4 won from A-5;
5-1 to boost themselves into fourth 
place in league I. Irwin Breier, of
the PiKAs led his team to an 8-4 
victory over the fighting Theta Xis.
Thursday, A-5, smarting from its 
defeat of the previous day, nosed 
out B-l; 3-1, although the B-l team 
collected 8 hits to the A-5 boys 7. 
Malcolm Mattox and Leon Forman 
held each others team to 8 hits 
apiece, but Mattoxs team, B-4, man
aged to get five runs over the plate 
while Cameron Hall only tallied 
three. The powerful B-2 team led 
the Beta Sigs in the early innings 
of their game, and maintained that 
lead, despite a gallant three-run 
rally by the Beta Sigs in the fourth 
inning, to win; 11-4. Dave Crump of 
the Kappa Sigs and Bob Scott of 
B-5 put on a tense pitchers battle; 
the final score being 1-0, favor of 
B-5. Bob Scott allowed four hits to 
Dave Crumps five. B-3 tumbled the 
Betas 6-3 by coming from behind in 
the last two innings of the game.
Fridays game betwen A-3 and 
Citcom Clan was a real thriller. In 
the tenth inning, Brooklyn Benkos boys managed to pull ahead of 
Citcom to win by a whisker; 7-5. 
The Betas and the SAEs fought it 
out for last place. The Delts slugged 
out fifteen hits to the Tau Delts 7, 
but lost the game 12 to 10. Merle 
Wolff and A1 Sher were the respec
tive pitchers. The fighting PiKA 
team won their second game of the 
week by being the only civilian team 
to defeat an Army team, A-2, this 
week. Irwin Breier held the A-2s to 
6 hits, his team winning 6 to 4. A-4 
snowed under the Kappa Sigs to the 
tune of 22 to 4.

TUESDAY, JULY 27, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
Should Army And Civilian Students 
Have Touch Football Competition?
Are the civilian students at Tech so inferior physically to the Army 
boys that a touch football competition would be dangerous? This is what 
the Physical Education Department feels, but is it true? Ill grant that the 
ASTP boys are about two years older than the average civilian student 
nowadays, but this should not amount to a sufficient difference to make the 
sport dangerous. The Department of Physical Education, considering this 
state of affairs, would like to see the Army boys dropped from this com
petition, and have it run on an entirely civilian basis.
This desire to separate the Army
and the civilians was partially 
brought about by the fact that the 
Army boys are supposedly taking 
advantage of the intramural pro
gram to evade the Physical Fitness 
Program, but isnt this rather a false 
assumption? There are 50 men to 
a platoon, of whom but 12 are ex
cused from class for intramurals, 
leaving 38 in each class. However, 
these 12 are only excused on the 
days they play, usually once or 
twice a week, two out of a total of 
6 hours a week. Therefore I can 
hardly see that this is sufficient rea
son to take the Army boys out of 
competition with the civilians.
Perhaps the Army boys are 
much better developed physically 
than the civilians, and perhaps in
tramurals do interfere with the 
Physical Fitness program, but I 
dont believe either is true. In that 
case is there any reason that the 
two groups should be separated? 
Were the Intramural Program run 
on an entirely civilian basis the two 
groups would lose nearly all of their 
contact with each other, for it is 
through sports that they have their 
greatest association. Of course the 
plan as it now stands is merely to 
separate them in Touch Football, 
but a precedent would be set which 
might be carried on and on when 
the time comes for other activities 
to commence.
What do the rest of you students 
think about it?* * *
To those of you who are interested
in obtaining practice fields and room 
for non-intramural games, the cut 
is free on Mondays and Tuesdays 
from one to four and all day on Sat
urday, according to Mr. Moses. To 
obtain use of the fields, they should 
be reserved by signing up for them 
with the Physical Education De
partment.
* * *
Another gripe about that same old 
thing. The other day a mushball 
game was being played in the Bowl 
at the same time that a Phys. Ed. 
instructor was giving calisthenics to 
a group of Army boys, also in the 
Bowl. It so happened that the in
structor had his men in such a spot 
that they were right in the middle 
of the ball diamonds left field. 
When asked to move down, a short 
distance, which could very easily 
have been done, the instructor re
plied sarcastically, I dont see why 
I should. Why the hard nose?

Army Golfers Defeat 
Small Civilian Team
The A.S.T.P. men have another 
bright spot on their record  the 
civilians another black mark. All 
because of a golf match.
The student body got off to a bad 
start by not showing any interest in 
the elimination for the team. The 
services of six Tech golfers were 
promised so that the scheduled 
match with golfers from the Tech
A.S.T.P. might be played. However, 
only four of these players showed 
up at the match; so Pvt. Frank Studer, head of the Army team, agreed 
to play a four-man match.
The total score of the match was: 
Army, lVz\ Civilians, 4 %. The indi
vidual scores were: Riddell 3, Pvt. 
Horner 0; King Vz, Pvt. Mikolvich 
2Vz\ Breier Vz, Pvt. Muligan 2y2;

some of the matches were rained 
out on the I7th or 18th holes, 
these scores were agreed upon. The 
best individual scores were: Riddell

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN TUESDAY, JULY 27, 1943
The TARTAN Presents ...
The Carnegie Grill at Work
The time is twelve noon of any 
school day at Tech. Book-weary stu
dents stream out of Industries Hall, 
Engineering Hall, Margaret Morri
son  in short, from all parts of 
Techs campus. Carnegie has recess
ed for an hour; its time to eat! Now 
there is no need to ask what is the 
most popular place on campus. Just 
follow the crowd to that little white 
building half a block down the street 
from Margaret Morrison. Race down 
the steps, jostle your way to the 
head of the line, and grab a tray. 
Now start ordering: chip steaks,
jello salads, huckleberry pies, ice 
cream cones. Its easy; just grunt to 
the waitress, point to a dish, and 
there it is on your tray. But look be
hind the scenes, see what really 
goes on in the kitchen, and see just 
how much work and worry goes 
into that 35-cent lunch of yours.
A typical week-day at the grill be
gins at six oclock. This is long be
fore the average Tech student rolls 
over for his last forty winks before 
his mad dash to make an eight 
oclock class. But in the clean, effi
cient kitchen of the grill, all is ac
tivity. Breakfast must be prepared 
and fruit juices, cereals, and muffins 
must make their appearance behind 
the counter.
After breakfast comes lunch, but 
its not as easy as all that. Late-comers for breakfast, the ones who took 
more than forty winks, continue 
drifting in till eleven oclock, about 
the time that some students begin 
arriving for lunch. So ham sand
wiches and chocolate cake are put 
on the counter beside the breakfast 
dishes. At eleven-thirty the upstairs 
inn is opened and remains thus until 
one-thirty, while the harried kitchen 
staff tries to supply both cafeterias 
with highly rationed meat and can
ned foods.
After lunch come the mid-after
noon snacks, and this goes on while 
dinner is being prepared. Diners 
start arriving at five-thirty and stay
until eight oclock. They cant hang 
around much longer because the 
grills busy day is over at eightthirty oclock. The grills staff then 
wearily crawls home, adding up ra
tion points and wondering how 
theyre ever going to make tomor
rows allotment of hot roast beef 
sandwichesbut they always seem 
to manage.
Despite all the confusion outside, 
the grills kitchen with its efficiency 
gives the impression of being con
structed and directed by one of 
Techs own methodical engineers. 
At one side are the ice-boxes con
taining meats, vegetables, butter, 
eggs, and other perishables, and 
canned goods and staples. On the 
other side of the room are the bakery 
division and the dish-washers (me
chanical, by the way). The grill 
does all its own baking except its 
bread and rolls. The dishes come to 
the dish-washer from upstairs 
through a chute. After they go 
through the machine, which looks 
like a miniature water-wheel, they 
are dried by hand. Any suggestions 
for mechanical driers should be for
warded immediately to the grills 
manager, Miss Mary Maxwell.
In the cellar of the grill are the 
warehouse and rest-rooms for the 
forty-odd employees. If plans go ac
cording to schedule, the cellar will 
soon be remodeled and fire-proofed. 
The grills cellar also serves as a 
sort of cross-roads. Many pipes from 
other buildings on campus pass 
through there.
The grill serves from 1,200 to 1,300 
meals daily. This number represents 
a considerable increase over the to
tals in previous years and may be 
attributed to the closing of the 
Beanery to civilian students and to 
the ration situation. Many students 
who formerly ate at home now eat 
at the grill where ration points are 
not yet taken. Thus the inside story 
of inside upholstering at Carnegie.
At Right:
Fay Colman is shown here as she punches the machine that swallows 
all your pennies, dimes, and dollars. The machine may seem pretty hungry 
for such a small place as the Grill, but youd be surprised at the expenses 
the little food dispensary runs up.
Below Right:
We wont bother with names here, since they are students whom prob
ably everyone knows. They seem to be just about through their portions of 
chefs boondoggling, and are enjoying a little, shall we say, chat? Anyway, 
they seem satisfied.
Below:
After the fun is over for the customers, the work starts for the cleanup 
squad. Here Betty Bucci clears away the last remnants of the mealthe 
dishes. Another day has drawn to a close at the Carnegie Grill.
Chef William Angeloff smiles menacingly at the helpless particles of 
food in the pots before him as he makes the food ready for eating. One 
often wonders who does the cooking at the chefs home.
Mrs. Sue Rush turns for a moment to smile at the camera, look at the 
little birdie, or whatever you want to call it. Everyone else looks too, in
cluding the customers. The girls are quite tired by now, for the end of their 
day is fast approaching, and, they are just waiting for the tail end of the 
early evening rush of business.
