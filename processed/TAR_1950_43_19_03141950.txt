Mens Dormitory Rental Rates 
To Be Increased Next Semester
Although the final rate schedule is not yet available, the ad
ministration has announced that increases in mens dormitory rates 
will be made and will become effective next year.
The following announcement from the Committee on Auxiliary 
Enterprises explains the necessity and the approximate amount of 
the increase. Full details will be published in a future issue of the 
Tartan.
For several years the costs of providing: dormitory service have 
continued to increase, and Carnegie has been delaying what seemed 
to be inevitable increases in mens dormitory rntal rates in the hope 
that the general price level when stabilized might make further in
creases unnecessary. It has now become clear, however, that in
creases can no longer be postponed.
In the announcement of the new rates, which will become ef
fective at the opening of the 1950 fall term, it is deirable to men
tion a few points that may give the students a better understanding 
of the situation and thus of the necessity for the present increase.
In the first place, the financial operations of the mens dormi
tories are kept separately from the other financial operations of CIT. 
In other words the funds for both the maintenance and rehabilita
tion of the dormitories have come, and must continue to come, from 
dormitory rentals. And thus when, on account of continued in
crease in costs of maintenance and rehabilitation, the total income 
is not sufficient to meet those financial requirements, the rentals 
must be increased. And this is the condition we face.
A careful study of costs made by the Controllers office shows 
that there must be an increase in total income from dormitory fees 
of approximately 15%.
A few comparisons may be in order. The new rates are, on the 
average, only 30% higher than prewar (1941), whereas jnost items 
in the cost of living have practically doubled. Another indication 
of the rise in costs of other operations of CIT since the war is that 
it has been necessary to increase the tuition in two of our three 
colleges by 67%. It may be of interest also to note that CIT is not 
the only institution that has found it necessary to increase dormitory 
rents. The general average of rates in comparable colleges centers 
around $200 to $220 per year. The range of rates in these colleges 
is from $120 to $380. CITs new rates will cover the range from 
124 to 268, with the general average around $200.
It is recognized that there are different types of mens dormi
tory facilities. For example, the FPHA units, Engelbrecht, and Miller 
Halls might be considered in one group, Scobell Hall in a middle 
category, and Henderson, Welch, Boss and McGill in another cate
gory. It will be noted therefore that a slight differentiation has 
been made in the percentage increases for these different groups, the 
average of all being approximately 15%.
Committee on Auxiliary Enterprises.
Tarquans To Present 
Swimmin And Swayin
Featuring a variety of dance styles set to water formations, the 
Tarquans of CIT will present a water ballet entitled Swimmin 
and Swayin  on Friday and Saturday, March 17 and 18, at 8:00 p. m.
The tivo performances will include many tempos, such as the 
tango, the old fashioned squared
dance, and several syncopated 
numbers. The music ranges from 
the classical Liebestraum to the 
popular jazz version of Darktown Strutters Ball.
WAA Production 
Although sponsored by the 
Tarquans, the production is the 
result of many hours of work and 
effort on the part of all the mem
bers of the WAA. All the work, 
including the lighting, planning, 
props, publicity, and acting has 
been done by the girls under the
direction of Miss Ruth Bush of the 
womens physical education de
partment.
The Modern Dance Club will 
combine their dances with the 
water show, performing at the be
ginning and again at the finale. 
They will present special synco
pated dance numbers.
One of the main attractions is 
an original routine developed by 
June Miles and Analee Gelman in 
which they perform to a special

Placement 
Bureau Moves 
To New Wing
Priority System Used 
For Senior Interviews
In their new wing at IH 240, the 
Bureau of Placements in continu
ing the work o' placing graduating 
seniors and alumni with jobs. Now, 
at last, they have their own com
fortable modern rooms, instead of 
empty classrooms and borrowed 
offices, in which representatives of 
the various companies can inter
view the applicants.
The interview system, begun 
about 40 years ago, continues in 
operation as one of the most ef
fective ways for companies to 
evaluate prospective employees. 
Every year the bureau writes to 
over 500 companies to find jobs 
for the new and old alumni.
Representatives Sent 
Companies send representatives 
to the campus or else write what 
qualifications they want in appli
cants. In the latter case, seniors 
send in applications. In the for
mer, interviewers come to talk to 
those interested and qualified for 
positions in the various companies.
This year, since there are more 
students than interviews, a prior
ity system has been initiated. The 
graduating senior fills out three 
cards, one for each of the three 
companies in which he is most in
terested.
Appointments Arranged 
When and if these companies 
send out" their interviewers, the 
student is informed, and appoint
ments are arranged. In this man
ner, the average student has a 
better opportunity for interviews 
than the rush and scramble, first 
come-first served method of for
mer years.
Since no system is infallible, the 
bureau is constantly striving to 
better the chances for post-gradof singers and directors alike 
came to a conclusion at the Car
negie Music Hall in one of the 
most successful Greek Sings ever 
held. Saturday nights Swing, fea
turing Bill LeRoys orchestra, put 
a fitting climax to the musical 
week-end.
Theta Xi, under the direction 
of Duane Sample, sang The 
Theta Xi Hymn, Vagabond, and 
Dry Bones. Kappa Alpha Theta, 
led by Herb Wilson, presented 
Little Boy Blue,. Spring Is 
Here, and Oh, Kappa Alpha 
Theta.
Sponsored by Pan-Hell and 
CFP, the Sing included groups 
representing twelve fraternities 
and seven sororities. Few of the 
singers had any musical training 
prior to the Sing, Jaut many of the 
groups had the quality of profes
sional organizations.
Judges for the Sing included 
Dr. Sterne and Dr. Barwick from 
the Univeristy of Pittsburgh, and 
Dr. Akmajian of PCW. All three 
are doctors of music.
Greek Sing is held each year in 
an endeavor to create an affair 
that will stimulate competitive 
spirit on an amateur level and to 
develop more spirit in the sorori
ties and the fraternities.

Editorials
Action Now
Councils recent action in discontinuing plans 
for organization of the sophomore class was due 
not only, as Council stated, to a lack of interest 
on the part of the students, but also to a degree of 
mismanagement on the part of council.
We will grant that Councils action would 
have been entirely justified if the students in
volved had shown this apathy to a well organ
ized and well publicized program of elections, 
but Council's plan left something to be desired.
The first call for petitions gained few candi
dates; most students had little or no idea at this 
time that an election was to be held. Many of 
the remainder did not know the final date that 
petitions would be accepted or the date of the 
election. This, combined with the beginning of 
the Christmas recess, brought the first attempt to 
a sorry conclusion.
Postponing the election date, Council called for 
more petitions. Many of the candidates had their 
campaigns set; they were waiting only for Council 
to give the green light. But, after a wait of several 
weeks, the only announcement forthcoming was 
that the elections were cancelled due to a lack 
of student interest. The reasons given were that 
one position was uncontested and that no soph
omore had inquired about Councils long silence 
on the election date.
Does one uncontested position indicate dis
interest on the part of the students? We dont 
believe so. Was Council planning to gauge the 
degree of student interest by the number of 
individuals inquiring about Councils inertia? 
This seems a poor policy  most students 
expected Council to do its job correctly and 
announce elections procedures according to plan.
The blame is equally shared between Council 
and the students. We believe that there are as 
many, if not more, interested individuals in the 
sophomore class as in the freshman. The sopho
mores should make use of every channel  
speaking before Council, pressure on Council 
members, or the procedure of initiative as out
lined in the Handbook  to force an election to 
be held. Councils action is not yet legal, for a 
quorum was not present at the last meeting.
The response of the sophomore class to this 
unwarranted action on the part of Council will 
be a true measure of the interest and initiative 
of the Class of 52.
A Good Sign
We do not imagine that the increase in dor
mitory rates will make anyone happy, but the 
administration policy of giving a full explanation 
for the increase is something to applaud.
There has always been a great amount of 
misunderstanding on the part of the student 
body about the allocation of fees. A clear cut 
statement concerning the distribution of money 
within the various school budgets, such as has 
been given in the announcement of dormitory 
rent increases, would prevent students from 
erroneously concluding that Skibo profits are 
paying for the new addition to Engineering hall. 
That is just one misconception about the finan
cial operation of the school that we have heard. 
There are many others and probably all justified 
in the students minds since the true facts have 
not been made available to them.

THAT SUNDAY MORNING FEELING
Council Concludes 
Sophs Uninterested
An open letter to the sophomore class:
Some of you may be puzzled by the recent 
resolution adopted by Council, which will result 
in a discontinuation of all efforts to organize the 
Class of 1952.
The Class Reorganization committee strongly 
urged the passage of such a measure because it 
felt that the sophomore class has little or no in
terest in such a program. This lack of interest 
has exhibited itself in many ways: a lack of
candidates for positions (one position had only 
one nominee), two delays in the closing date for 
election petitions to secure even those few can
didates, and no inquiries by sophomores as to 
why the election has been postponed as long as 
it has. Furthermore, the committee feels that any 
further attempts to organize a disinterested soph
omore class will have detrimental effects on the 
attitudes of the present and incoming freshman 
towards class organization. The attitude of the 
sophomore class towards the school and campus 
life are already too well developed for any sys
tem of class organization to achieve its estab
lished purpose.
The idea of class reorganization is not being 
discarded. Council is merely concentrating all 
such efforts on the freshman class and conceding 
that organization of the class of 52 is, at pres
ent, futile and therefore should be abandoned. 
Council also feels that if the class of ^52 really 
wants a class organization, they will have enough 
initiative and interest in such ari organization to 
submit an initiative, as stipulated on page 27 of 
the handbook, urging Council to reconsider or
ganizing the Class of 52.

Class Showed Little InterestStudents Will Investigate Industry
A project to help students gain a better understanding of the 
problems of industry facing our society today, and a study of these 
problems and areas of tension in the light of the ideals and prin
ciples of religion is being sponsored by the National Intercollegiate 
Christian Council. ,

Live Cooperatively
Students will live cooperatively 
as far as possible, sharing the 
costs of room and board. A resi

Outstanding play was seen in 
the Federal League this week as
all-campus basketball crown last 
Tuesday afternoon.
With the seasons end only three 
days away, the board approved 
legislation which will inaugurate 
a sudden-death tournament in
volving six teams to replace the 
round robin play off of three 
league titlists.
The boards decision, as rapid 
as it was unexpected, found little 
opposition. The new ruling throws 
second place teams in each league 
into the playoffs this week.
Unbeaten Emanon and Beta
the Phi Kappa A five rolled over Theta Pi drew byes in the first

Carnegie Athletic Director Retains 
Spirit From Era of National Fame
Clarence Buddy Overend is not only the mainstay of Carnegies 
athletic program, but he is also a swell guy.
Does anyone need first h#md information concerning Techs his
tory? Then make an appointment to see Mr. Overend.
-----------------
Though far behind in the total 
team standings, the 1950 track 
team showed surprising strength 
in the dashes in the annual Jun
ior A.A.U. championships held at 
Schoonamaker Hall in South Park 
last Saturday. Even without their 
top men in action, the Pitt Pan
thers were able to cop the meet 
with 39 points. Other teams repre
sented local high schools and col
leges and some entries from East 
Ohio.
Jim Andrews, who transferred 
from Geneva College last year, 
and Johnny Luchok took the first 
two places in the 50 yard dash to 
score the only points for Tech. 
The winning time of 5.6 is one 
of the best times in the South 
Park field house for this year. In 
the mile, which was run in two 
heats, Carmen and Cooper took 
second and third in their heat, but 
the times of the other heats were 
faster and neither boys time was 
placed in the final standings. Lead
ing midway in the race, Connie 
Hamman missed a high hurdle 
and did not finish the race. In the 
50 yard lows, Hog Wiewel placed 
fourth in the final.
Coach Halferty has made a sur
prise showing in this meet inas
much as the team has not been 
on the track all season and all of 
the other teams have been prac
ticing for some time. On Satur
day, March 25, the Senior AAU 
Championships will be held in the 
field house with all of the out
standing athletes of the district 
eligible for action. With  two 
weeks of practice the Plaid team 
should show better in the meet 
than expected at first.

Editor, The Tartan:
I would like to call your atten
tion to an error in the March 7th 
issue of the Tartan. On page four 
in the article concerning the PennOhio meet credit is given to Tim 
Astle for swimming the second
100 yards in Techs 400 yard free 
style relay team. Bill Slowik 
swam this 100 yards instead of 
Astle. He turned in a fine per
formance and was essential to 
the teams winning second place. 
Credit should be given where 
credit is due. Bill Slowik deserves 
this credit.
Sincerely,
Tom Astle.
[We sincerely regret the error 
in last weeks issue which erro
neously named the wrong man to 
the second palce relay team. Bill 
Slowiks performance was indeed 
essential to the win.Ed.]

His appearance belies his age, 
but he will admit being the vice 
president of the first class to enter 
Tech in 1905. Since then he has 
| been connected with Carnegies 
j athletic program almost continu
ously.
Active AS Student
As a student he was captain of 
the hockey team, the first team to 
represent Tech in intercollegiate 
athletics, and chairman of the Stu
dent Athletic Board. He was an 
active and interested alumnus un
til 1920 when he become chairman 
of the Athletic Council. Upon the 
death of Mr. Harren in 1923, he 
became graduate manager of ath
letics. In 1937 the Council was reI organized and he was named di
rector of athletics. Although his 
official title has often changed, his 
actual work has not.
Buddy Overend reminisced 
about the Athletic program at Cari negie. He remembered that the 
1 schools original gym was the 
| building now called the Inn. Then 
; he said that the varsity baseball 
was discontinued in 1925 because 
the team had no place to practice, 
j The Athletic Council, which at one 
time was more independent of ad
ministrative jurisdiction than at 
present, gave the school $15,000 
toward the purchase of the 
grounds now used as the soccer 
field.
Reminiscing
One of Buddys stories concerns 
the finances of the teams. Mr. 
Overend has seen CIT teams rise 
from humble beginnings to the top 
of the scale. In 1905, the 120 stu
dents enrolled here were asked to 
contribute to an equipment fund. 
The total came to $7.50. This was 
the humble beginning. During one 
of its peak years Tech played 
Couthern Cal in the Collesium in 
Los Angeles. CITs share in the 
gate was over $75,000. This was 
the top of the scale.
Mr. Overend added that al
though we lost this game, we made 
a fine showing. Pitt, who played 
Southern Cal in the Rose Bowl 
that year, lost their game by two 
points more than we lost ours with 
U.S.C.
Favorable Outlook
Mr. Overend feels that Tech's 
outlook for future varsity teams 
is favorable. The school will con
tinue in its Class B schedule, he 
commented, but if the teams con
tinue to improve at this year's 
rate, Tech will soon regain all the 
respect and prestige that were 
j once hers. And Buddy Overend 
will share a part of that respect
i and prestige.
Six Fra tern ities En ter 
IM Rifle Semi-Finals
With the first round firing completed, eight of the fourteen

sudden-death rifle match.
Tuesday saw the Alpha Tau Omega No. 1 team fire into first
In its second revolutionary move of the year, Carnegies 
intramural board has inaugurated a new method of determin
ing the all-campus basketball championhsip.
By doing away with the cumbersome and colorless round 
robin playoff and instituting a six team sudden-death tourna
ment, the student governing body revived a rapidly dying 
interest in post league games.
The new legislation, following in the wake of the abolish
ment of the all-points trophy, is indicative of a progressive at
titude gradually rising within the board.
The shortcomings of the previous method have long been 
a source of irritation to many followers of intramural ath
letics. The most glaring weakness was evident in the soft
ball round robin matches. This left the championship as un
decided as when the playoffs had started.
The approach of final exams forced one team to drop out 
of the second round. Ironically, this was the very team that 
would have been declared champions had the original round 
been of the sudden-death variety.
This sudden-death procedure, involving elimination upon 
the loss of one game and the awarding of byes in certain 
rounds, is really nothing astounding. It has long been the ac
cepted practice in all major collegiate tourneys and in most 
intramural playoffs over the country.
By adding the second place teams to the tournament rolls, 
the current system offers a more accurate final ranking of the 
teams. It is quite conceivable that a second place team in a 
league may also be the number two team of the whole school.
Significantly, the first place team, all of whom finished 
their leagues unbeaten this year, retain the awards and points *as league title holders regardless of their showing in the tour
nament. In this way the system can give a team that may have 
been upset in one contest the opportunity to take the champion
ship. Yet it still can retain credit for the upset in the form 
of league crowns. 
The board is also now in the process of revising its con
stitution. Although this will probably not produce anything 
of a cataclysmic nature, it should serve to clarify present poli
cies and pave the way for more far reaching revisions in the 
future.

Inquiring
Reporter
Wandering about in the maze of 
hallways and dim-lit stairways, 
this inquiring reporter looked for 
Pitt students who might be hidden 
in some nook around the Com
mons Room. Knowing Pitt stu
dents to be intelligent and ob
servant individuals, the reporter 
asked their opinionWhat do Pitt 
students think of Carnegie?
Jack Shano:
I dont think there are a finer 
bunch of people 
anywhere; they 
tap beer well. 
There is an 
over - emphasis 
of tec hnology 
at Carnegie. I 
believe in a 
more liberal 
education. It is 
a real tragedy 
that Tech 
doesnt have a better football 
team. An intra-city competition 
would benefit Pittsburgh as well 
as the colleges. But Tech is not in 
our league right now. Something 
should be done to improve PittTech relations. By the way, theres 
a fine view of the Pitt cathedral 
from the Tech campus.
Charles Jarrett:
I like Tech very much; in fact,
I went there in 1944. But I dont
are a. very friendly bundi. Techs 
football team is doing well under 
the circumstances. Do you know 
that there are five or six Tech 
graduates in our law school at 
Pitt? There should be a friendly 
feeling between our two colleges.
I suggest an annual beer party 
on the cut. 
Joanne Gray:
Tech is wonderful. All my 
family went there and by brother 
goes there now. Morewood Gar
dens and the 
fraternity 
houses are 
beautiful. The 
only thing I 
dont like is 
that Tech stu
dents are cold 
to outsiders. 
Although Tech 
had a wonderf u 1 spirit a t 
that joint rally last year, they 
dont seem too interested in their 
team. There were not many peo
ple at the games I went to. Id like 
to see Pitt and Tech play each 
other again, but Techs not in con
dition now. Maybe later, with inprovement, that could be done. It 
would be better relations between 
our colleges. I have heard about 
the old Tech teams; they must 
have been really good.
Dolly Martin:
Tech is not a friendly school; 
the atmosphere there is different. 
Students concentrate too much on 
academic standards. Although this 
is admirable it can be overdone. 
I think the architecture is per
fect and the plays far surpass 
anything Pitt could hope to do. 
The Tuck Shop is much more 
attractive than Skibo. Come to 
think of it, Tech kids as a whole 
are very nice. Relations should be 
improved between our colleges. 
That demonstration last year was 
terrific, with the cheerleaders, 
band, and all. We need more 
things like that. Why dont Tech 
and Pitt have organized pep ral
lies together? That would be good 
for the spirit of both colleges. 
Now Carnegie students, what do 
you think oi Pitt?

to an early death because of its 
inability to overcome the inertia 
of the social organism it seeks to 
correct.
UWF advocates the transforma
tion of the UN cnarter into a 
world constitution. This consti
tution would establish world leg
islative, executive, and judicial 
branches. It would make mem
bership open to all nations with
out right of secession, give all 
powers not expressly delegated to 
the world government to the 
member nations, and make its 
laws directly enforceable on the 
individual. It would include pro
visions for taxation, amendments, 
and proportional representation. 
Armament Control 
Above all, the UWF wants to 
see the control of national mili
tary establishments and arma
ments, particularly weapons of 
mass destruction, vested in the 
world government. Adequate in
spection and enforcement systems 
are also a necessity here.
National and international sen
timent appears to be with the 
UWF. Their chapters embrace 
twenty counties; sixteen of our 
state legislatures have voted fav
orably on plans for a world gov
ernment. The lists*of influential 
organizations and individuals said 
to support UWF views are lengthy 
and imposing. But the fact re
mains that the Congress still 
turns a cold eye upon the UWF
and others seeking to remake the 
world.
How many of the favorable res
olutions and opinion polls repre
sent only lip service to an ideal 
is a matter of conjecture. For 
each advocate of the plan we find 
an opponent. Major George Field
ing Elliot, in a recent Pittsburgh 
address, commented that it is 
necessary to dispel certain dan
gerous illusions . . . that a world 
government will establish world 
peace ...
Granted that tne majority of 
people will work for world gov
ernment, there still remain several 
questionsas those mentioned re
cently by Assistant Secretary of 
State John D. Hickerson:
1. Will the United States agree 
to a common citizenship, a com
mon currency and taxes, and a 
common standard of living?
2. What if the laws and institu
tions of the United States are not 
used as a basis for the world gov
ernment? Will we accept the new 
ones?
3. Are we willing to have the 
American people represented by a 
minority in any powerful world 
legislature?
4. Is the will to survive strong
er than economic, social, and po
litical differences?
Without Russia?
Another interesting fact is that 
Russia and her satellites now. con
trol more of the worlds popula
tion than do the Western Demo
cracies. Can a world government 
succeed without them?
As the UW1? says, the time for 
action is now. The question is 
whether or not the plan of world 
government advocated by the 
UWF can succeed without first 
resolving the basic economic, so
cial and political differences 
which exist between nations. In 
the past, these obstacles have 
proved to be the downfall of all 
well intentioned attempts at world 
federation.
Is the public fear or mass de
struction weapons stronger than 
nationalism or public apathy 
and inertia? Past history seems 
to indicate tlie negative.

Phi Gamma Pi 
Sponsors Tea 
For Pledges
Phi Gamma Pi, the Evening 
School sorority, held a tea for 
this seasons pledges on Sunday 
afternoon, March 5, at the Union. 
The sorority, although one of the 
younger social organizations on 
the campus, is always in the fore 
when it comes to campus activi
ties.
Pledges were selected from 
women evening school students 
who expressed a desire to join 
the membership of Phi Gamma 
Pi. These pledges must have 
maintained satisfactory grades in 
their various subjects.
Each pledge has been assigned 
two big sisters, who are fullfledged sorority members. These 
ladies have the pleasant task of 
acquainting the novice with the 
aims, objectives, and functions of 
Phi Gamma Pi; past, present, and 
future.

Healthy Competition
Election of officers for the administrative body of Evening 
Student Council for the 1950-51 school year took on a bit of 
the old fighting spirit that previously prevailed at these elec
tions.
For the last several years, election of officers has been a 
more or less spiritless affair with those who were willing to 
sacrifice themselves being elected to take over these tasks.
This year there was more than usual pre-election stumping 
for candidates. It was not at all unusual for several different 
people representing their own favorite candidates to attempt 
swaying your opinion in favor of their special candidate.
This pre-electioneering is a healthy sign, for it denotes a 
return of greater interest in the affairs of Council, and there
fore in school extracurricular activities.
It is hoped that this interest in activities spreads to the 
student body as a whole. Can \ve look forward to the early 
return of general elections of the Student Council officers and 
representatives T General school election of Council represen
tatives is the true democratic way of student body participa
tion in student government.

News
And
Views
There are still some students on 
evening campus who do not know 
where the Study Hall in The In
dustries Biulding is located. We 
were approached Friday evening 
by one of the evening students 
who was wandering aimlessly 
about Industries Hall in search 
of a study room. Of course, we di
rected him to Study Room 132 H. 
This room is across the hallway 
from the Registrars office.
We have mentioned this fact 
many times in the Plaid, but ob
viously there are still some stu
dents who never trouble them
selves to pick up a copy of the 
Plaid.1So that our readers will not get 
the idea that we intend to use this 
column to berate our fellow stu
dents, we will turn to more pleas
ant thoughts and mention that the 
Semi-Formal Dance to be held by 
Evening Student Council, Satur
day, March 18, is as fine a time 
and place as any, for evening stu
dents to express a feeling of so
cial regards for evening school 
and its aims.
Just to keep the records straight, 
we would like to mention that this 
years Shakespearean Play to be 
directed by Iden Payne and pre
sented in the Little Theatre will 
be Richard III. This is a his
torical play dealing with the final 
conclusion of the Wars of the 
Roses between the rival houses of 
York and Lancaster.
Sigma Delta Phi, evening school 
fraternity will hold a Social Sat
urday evening, March 28. New 
pledges are to be presented to the 
members at this affair.
Ray Schwalm, Chairman of the 
Decorating Committee for the 
Semi-Formal Dance to be held 
Saturday, March 18. would appre
ciate as many of the gevenin 
school fellows as possible to show 
up Saturday, any time from 9:00 
, a. m. to 4:00 p. m. to help with 
1 the decorating of Thistle Hall.
