Carnegie To Train 
Overqualified Men 
In ASTP Program
Carnegie Tech has just been 
chosen one of the few schools to un
dertake a special task for the ASTP. 
Recently an additional group of 
soldiers has been sent to Carnegie 
Tech under the ASTP. These men, 
who are clasified in a new advanc
ed phase curriculum category, are 
soldiers who are thought to be 
overqualified for regular ASTP 
work and need the individual atten
tion which is given to post-graduate 
students.
In the many Replacement Train
ing Centers and troop units have 
been discovered soldiers who have 
engineering training of even a wider 
range than that required in the 
ASTP. All of these men are college 
graduates, and some even have a 
doctors or a masters degree.
Field boards have been recom
mending these men for the ASTP 
because with just a little more train
ing they can be made familiar with 
recent developments in engineering 
fields as these apply to Army prob
lems, and they will be ready to an
swer the demand of the ASTP for 
advanced technicians. Although 
some of the men will require addi
tional specialized training, others 
need only to refresh their minds.
The new Advanced Phase Curric
ulum will be a combination of a 
delicate placement problem and a 
highly specialized advanced tech
nical training. \
Most of the men will be assigned 
to remain at Carnegie Tech for 12

Congress Annuls NY A; 
Aid Still Available
One of the recent measures taken 
by Congress has been the abolish
ment of N. Y. A. Throughout the 
depression years many Carnegie 
students received much needed 
financial aid from N. Y. A., but the 
present war boom has decreased 
the necessity of such subsidies.
The original purpose of the N. 
Y. A. college program was to em
ploy needy students and thus ena
ble them to remain in school. Al
though the jobs created by this 
agency were non-essential, the stu
dents doing them received valuable 
experience
At one time there were about 250 
Carnegie students affiliated with 
N. Y. A.; however, last fall that 
number dropped to 40. It is obvious 
that N. Y. A. has served its purpose 
and is no longer needed. Increased 
family incomes and numerous op
portunities for students to obtain 
higher paying jobs in industry are 
responsible for the decreased stu
dent interest in N. Y. A. The em
ployment office announces that 
there are plenty of jobs available 
for all students desiring employ
ment through the school.
Attention, ASTPers
This Thursday a box will be plac
ed in the lobby of Scobell Hall with 
the laconic word TARTAN in
scribed on the front.
In this box Carnegie servicemen 
are requested to deposit all items 
they would like printed in the Tar
tan in the next issue. Gripes, hilari
ous stories, suggestions, photo
graphs. and just plain old news will 
be warmly welcomed.

MR. KECK, GARDENER
The Carnegie Union in its years 
of existence has seen many activi
tiessorority meetings, publica
tions, solemn gatherings of the Stu
dent Council and ACACbut for 
the first time some actual manual la
bor is being done: two Victory Gar
dens have been planted in the back 
of the building by members of CarFreshman Organization 
Plan Meets With Approval
Overwhelming approval was the first reaction of the freshmen to a 
proposal to organize, presented at the Alpha Phi Omega Orientation Pro
gram meeting last Thursday. The proposal, presented by two freshmen in 
short talks following the regular program, followed close on the heels of 
an editorial in the Tartan urging that freshmen take more interest in school 
 activities.Captitain Motnick Joins 
ASTP Cadre To Head 
Incoming Company
Because of the new group of men 
expected to arrive here at Tech for 
the ASTP program, the cadre has 
been increased by six enlisted men 
and one officer, Captain Motnick.
negies Administration staff. The 
amateur farmers are Miss Elizabeth 
Moore, secretary to Mr. Charles 
Eliot; and Mr. Frank Keck, super
intendent of Buildings and Grounds. 
In addition to the usual harvest of 
blisters, backaches and sunburns, 
these Tech gardeners can look for
ward to a sizeable crop of various 
vegetablesand weeds. Already 
Miss Moore and Mr. Keck have had 
home-grown dinners picked from 
their rows of beans, tomatoes, corn 
and radishes.
There is no reason why these pi
oneers should be the lone ranchers 
of Carnegie Tech. Behind the 
Union there is an acre of land, which 
according to Mr. Keck offers def
inite possibilities for additional Vic
tory Gardens. The soil is there; how 
about it, faculty members? Here is 
a chance to work with something 
that cannot talk backno bean will 
complain about too much home
work, no tomato argue about a high
er grade. If in the next few days, 
professors have new excuses for 
unmarked bluebooks and unprepar
ed recitations, we will know that 
our suggestion has borne fruit.
CAPTAIN MOTNICK
He will command the company 
which the new men will comprise. 
There are, at the present time, three 
companies, commanded by 1st Sgt. 
Sommers, 1st Sgt. Dobbs, and Lt. 
Pickrell.
Capt. Motnick comes to Pittsburgh 
from the Third Service Command at 
Baltimore, Maryland. He is now 
classified as a limited service officer 
because of a foot injury.
He enlisted in the army in 1928 
and served as a non-commissioned 
officer. During this period he had two 
years foreign service in Hawaii. He 
has also had previous experience in 
the ROTC at Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute.
Captain Motnick is a graduate of 
the infantry officers course at the 
Infantry School, Fort Benning, 
Georgia; and he also graduated from 
the Administrative School at Fort 
Washington, Virginia.
It is expected that the new com
pany will be quite large, and for this 
reason plans have been made to 
house them in Cedar Hall and in 
some fraternity houses. The PiKA 
and the ATO houses have already 
been evacuated.
Chapels Discontinued
C. W. C. A. announces that they 
have discontinued Sunday chapels. 
These were held every Sunday aft
ernoon in Little Theater or Sylvan 
Theater. They will be discontinued 
indefinitely.
Suggesting that Freshman Class 
Organization would be of great help 
in orienting freshmen at Tech, the 
first speaker presented a four-point 
program for the organization. Fol
lowing a show-of-hands vote, which 
showed the majority of those pres
ent to be heartily in favor of the 
program, the second speaker pre
sented a suggested pattern of organ
ization. This suggested pattern, 
which provoked many questions dur
ing the discussion period following 
the talks, has been tentatively ap
proved by the Army Civilian Activi
ties Council, pending the adoption 
of a formal constitution by the class.
The main purpose of the organ
ization, quoting from the four-point 
program is to get Tech interested 
in the freshmen, and the freshmen 
interested in Tech. Other points of 
the program are:
1. To foster school spirit among 
the freshmen.
2. To establish a spirit of coop
eration among the freshmen, 
through social and athletic activi
ties.
3. To encourage and assist fresh
man participation in extracurricular 
activities.
4. To sponsor an orientation pro
gram to acquaint freshmen with the 
particular department of engineer
ing in which they are enrolled.
Activities to carry out these pur
poses would include support and as
sistance of the Alpha Phi Omega 
Traditions program, social affairs for 
freshmen, intersectional athletic 
competition, tours of student activ
ity offices, joint facultv-administration-freshmen smokers to introduce 
students to school officials, and tours 
Continued on page jour
Freshman Senate Planned
The Army Civilian Activities 
Council has approved the following 
p^an of organization for the first 
Freshman Senate. Complete de
tails of the organization and its pur
poses are given in another article 
elsewhere in this issue.
1. Each of the seven freshman 
sections will elect two representa
tives to the first Senate. Elections 
will be certified by the faculty mem
ber in whose room they are held.
2. These representatives will 
meet, elect a chairman, and draw up 
a constitution.
3. The constitution will be pre
sented to the students for ratifica
tion, and then presented to the 
ACAC for approval.
4. If the ACAC approves the con
stitution, the Freshman Class organ
ization will become a regular stu
dent activity.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943
CditoA AnsncUain.
Can You Do Business With The Administration?
We have always considered the TARTAN as a clearing house for cam
pus opinion, as well as for news. Recently an attitude has been growing on 
the part of the students that has become hard to pass off. They feel, and 
with a great deal of justification, that the administration is not being fair 
to its civilian students. They do not especially begrudge the Army its 
sudden favor in the eyes of the officials of Tech government, but they do 
feel that their best interests are being ignored out of all proportion to 
their standing on the campus.
The event that has brought this feeling to a head was the recent sus
pension of a fraternity for what appears to be a minor and unnecessary 
reason. This one-year suspension was decided upon by the administra
tion because the fraternity had a hell week, a thing that has become fra
ternity tradition on Tech campus. The same sentence of one years sus
pension was given to another fraternity less than three months ago for 
the most flagrant violation of school and fraternity regulations. Two years 
ago, a third fraternity gave an unchaperoned, drunken party that lasted 
until four in the morning, and their punishment was merely a semesters 
stay on social probation. Is it any wonder, then, that these students be
lieve that their suspension is unjust? We can see their side of the ques
tion when they maintain that the only logical answer to the situation is 
that the administration must want to dispense with fraternities at Car
negie Tech.
Sorority activities are laboring under the burden of old-fashioned 
ideas held by the administration. In the first place, it took a terrific strug
gle on the part of the students to have sororities permitted on campus 
at all. They were finally allowed to exist with the provision that they 
would not join a national sorority for ten years. At the end of that time, a 
rule was passed in Intersorority Council to the effect that any sorority that 
wished could then go national. Last year one sorority was all ready 
to join a national sorority, when they were stopped by the administration 
with only the war and expense as the vague reasons for this denial of 
permission that is not constitutionally theirs to grant.
Publications are another sore point in the eyes of the student body. In 
spite of the fact that it costs more to publish a magazine or a newspaper 
now, the school has cut its appropriations to the publications although they 
expect the same quality and regularity as was formerly possible. The 
SCOTTIE, for instance, has an accumulated debt of nearly $400. Suddenly 
they have been told that this debt must be paid before their budget can be 
approved for next semester. This is a certain impossibility. The SCOTTIE 
has begun to make money; eventually the debt could be wiped from the 
slate, but they are not being given a chance to work it off. Why? The 
TARTAN, itself, has been increasingly subjected to the wishes of the Ex
ecutive Board as to what it shall print, and what it must not. On occasion 
they have even criticized the manner in which we have relayed news to 
the students. Perhaps it is too strong to say that the freedom of the press 
can be jeopardized by just such small matters of regulation, but we are 
trying to print a newspaper for the students, not a faculty bulletin.
Success Through Cooperation
Last year there was a rumor that spread most quietly around the 
school to the effect that some members of the administration wanted fra
ternities, sororities, publications, and all forms of student government 
done away with, and Carnegie Tech returned to its status as an institution 
of purely academic and technical learning. We gave no credence to this 
preposterous-sounding suggestion. Reluctantly we are coming to the real
ization that such a rumor is, at least, being substituted by the grad
ual tightening of the administration hold on campus activities. Isnt it 
a well-known fact the an institution of higher learning is respon
sible for the development of its students into well-rounded human 
beings capable of self-government, as well as reasonable facsimilies of 
textbooks? Surely, they do not want to turn Carnegie Tech into a mere 
factory for the production of 21-year old puppets with no real mental ma
turity. Every student active in campus affairs to whom we have talked has 
maintained that he is gaining more in responsibility, in initiative, and in 
human understanding by working at his chosen avocation than he ever did 
by simply attending school for sixteen years. In the final analysis, isnt 
that the goal of all education?
The students do not want to run wild; they merely want a chance to 
govern and express themselves without having to face what they believe 
to be unjust opposition on the part of their administration. We civilian 
students know that the governing board of Carnegie Tech has had to make 
readjustments because of the war and the situation it has forced upon the 
school. We would be interested and willing to co-operate with the adminis
tration in this readjustment, if we could be taken into their confidence. 
Therefore, what we primarily ask is a statement of policy on the part of 
that administration with regard to our campus activities; and we feel sure 
this is not too much to ask.
Opinion expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

Letters To The Editor
Freshman Organization
Dear Editor:
Exactly two months ago, some 160 
Freshmen entered Carnegie Tech. 
Everybody expected these new stu
dentsin spite of the added strain 
imposed by the accelerated course 
to carry on the Tech spirit by par
ticipating wholeheartedly in extra
curricular activities.
But have these Freshmen lived up 
to expectations? Have they direct
ed their energies toward making 
Tech a better place in which to live, 
instead of merely study? No! Less 
than one-fifth of the Class of 1947 is 
engaged in extra-curricular activi
ties. When Alpha Phi Omega call
ed an important meeting to orient 
the Freshman Class, a mere 66 
Freshmen found time to attend.
If Carnegie Tech is to retain its 
rank as an active, progressive
school, this situation must not be al
lowed to continue. Realizing this 
fact, a few members of the Class of 
1947 have drawn a tentative plan 
for Freshman Organization to pro
mote school interest among the 
Class of 1947. This plan is now pre
sented on the front page of this 
weeks Tartan. Freshmenread it; 
think it over; discuss it with your 
classmates; show your interest by 
constructive criticism. By all means, 
take it seriously. It is your organ
ization, and if it is successfulwith 
your cooperationit will make your 
college years ones which you will 
be able to look back upon with 
pleasure, for they will have taught 
you far more than you could have 
learned from books alone.

To the Editor:
In last weeks TARTAN there ap

about ASTP soldiers participating 
in varsity athletics here at Carnegie 
and at other army schools through
out the country. It is our belief that 
the subject deserves some additional 
comment.
To us the reason the Army wont 
allow ASTPers to compete in inter
collegiate sports isnt a mystery at 
all. It is quite obvious that we, all 
of us, are here for strictly business. 
The scholastic and military schedule 
bears this fact out. No time has 
been provided for such high-powered publicity sports as big-time foot
ball and hot-shot subsidized tennis 
stars. Let us remind all of you, and 
especially Pvt. Scott, that we are 
engaged in a war for our very lives 
and that the future engineers of

come from the playing fields of Car
negie Tech; they will come from the 
classrooms.
We are quite certain that the Gen
eral Staff has taken into considera
tion the necessity for a well-round
ed athletic program. But the pro
gram is for the benefit of the whole 
country, not just for the glory of a 
few high - pocketed basketball 
squads. Let Pvt. Scott answer this 
question: Would a soldier rather 
have a knowledge of baseball or a 
good practical repertoire of old 
fashionedruffantumble boxing and 
wrestling  when he is faced by a 
leering Jap with bayonet attached?
The ASTP physical exercise pro
gram includes one hour of boxing 
every weekto teach coordination 
and muscle control; one hour of hand 
to hand combatfor use in any bat
tle situation; one of tumblingthis 
will be a great help when a quick fall 
proves necessary; one of swimming 
/ self explanatory; the obstacle 
course and track practices  a re
production of battle conditions; and 
an hour of team sportsprimarily 
for recreation.
Why such human sports as 
baseball, football, and lacrosse are 
not indulged in is an easy problem 
to solve. Honest-tQ-God conscienti
ous ASTP men do not have ade
quate time for practice. Going in
to games unprepared and with the 
wrong muscles on edge, as it were, 
would undoubtedly result in poor 
performances, and more important, 
numerous injuries. On the other 
hand, men can play and enjoy soft
ball, volleyball, and tag football 
even if they have no special athletic 
experience. Too, no one will doubt 
but that they are much safer.
Pvt. Scotts statement about civil
ian students giving up athletics for 
the duration because of the pres
sure of essential, war-effort studies 
is quite silly when one considers 
that we soldiers, already veterans 
of the Army, are infinitely more val
uable to the government. If this 
were not true, not one of us would 
be studying engineering. Perhaps 
we would even be out of uniform. 
We must therefore concentrate on 
what the Army decides is of pri
mary importance. At present this 
is engineering, not next falls PittTech football game.

one of the girls
Helena Aronson came to Tech be
cause she was looking for a good 
school not too far from Cumberland, 
Maryland, which is her home town. 
Why she picked a school near home 
is one of those things that is hard 
to understand because although she 
loves to jaunt around on weekends 
she visits almost any place but Cum
berland. She started her mixed up 
career at Tech as a Costume Ec. The 
next year she was general studies 
and now she is a secretarial minor 
and very worried about whether or 
not she can get a job. At this point 
$he feels her education is a bit too 
scrambled for anyone to want to 
hire her, but she is about the only 
one who feels that way. She is tre
mendously interested in writing and 
started to work on the Tartan in 
her freshman year. When she was 
a sophomore, she was called to Al
pha Chi Alpha, national journalistic 
sorority, and in her junior year Pi 
Delta Epsilon, national journalistic 
fraternity. She was a junior edi
tor of the Tartan that year too. Now 
in her senior year she is co-managing editor. Besides work on school 
publications she was on the College 
Board of Mademoiselle.
Writing is not her only activity 
in school. She is president of 
Womens Guild, one of the most ac
tive womens philanthropic organ. . . Helena Aronson

she was president of Birch Hall, a 
freshman dormitory; this year she is 
vice-president of Whitfield. This 
spring Helena achieved the highest 
honor that can come to a Carnegie 
femmeMortar Board. In addition, 
she has the distinction of being one 
of the eleven remaining charter 
members of Mu Alpha Gamma 
sorority.
She is one of those unusual per
sons who is extremely well read, but 
who never has time to read any
thing except school books. As a re
sult two of her favorite courses have 
been creative writing and novel 
which require a lot of outside read
ing. She likes all kinds of music ex
cept hot brassy stuff; she has never 
learned to jitterbug because it is too 
tiringits more fun to watch other 
people knocking themselves out. 
Her most valued piece of jewelry is 
a little finger ring that looks like a 
buckle. Her jeweler father had it 
made for her on her sixteenth birth
day which was five years ago to
morrow. Right now she has a 
beautiful suntan which she must 
have got on one of her weekends be
cause she spends most of her week 
days in the Tartan office, the News 
Bureau or Maggie Murph.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTNTESDA, JLY 13, 1943
Freshmen Organize ...
Continued from page one
of the different departments, such
as Mechanical, Electrical, etc.
The suggested plan of organiza
tion, tentatively approved by the 
ACAC, calls for a freshman senate, 
made up of two elected representa
tives from each of the seven sec
tions, to serve as the governing body 
for the class. These fourteen men 
will elect one from their number to 
serve as chairman and such other 
officers as may be necessary. The 
senate will have power to appoint 
committees to carry out its pro
gram and activities.
Complete details of the method by 
which the first senate will be elected 
are contained in another article on 
page one. Probably the first act of 
the new senate will be to adopt a 
constitution for the class, secure the 
approval of the students for it, and 
then present it to the ACAC for 
approval. With the ACACs ap
proval, the class will become a reg
ular student organization.
As planned, the class will include 
only those freshmen who entered in 
May, 1943.

Monday the Beta Sigs were 
swamped under a barrage of hits 
and runs as they lost to A-5 to the 
tune of 17 to 1. Corwin gave up 14 
hits to the A-5s. The Delts lost to 
Citcom, 7 to 6, in a game that was 
tightly contested all the way. The 
commuters scored the winning runs 
in the seventh. On field one, Tues

Barr of the Kap Sigs and Wolff of 
the Delts gave up but three hits 
apiece. Citcom lost its second game 
of the season, 4 to 3, to Tau Delta 
Phi. Yorkin of the Tau Delts allow
ed but three hits to Citcom. B-4 took 
its first game of the second round 
from A-5, although outhit 10 to 6. 
Company A, platoon 3, keeping in 
their first round form, defeated the 
Kappa Sigs by the score of 8 to 3. 
Benko, pitcher for the Army team, 
held the fraternity men to four hits, 
which they didnt collect till the 
seventh.
Wednesday, Wylie of the SAEs 
let A-l collect 15 hits for a 13 to 3 
loss. A-2 came through with an easy
11 to 1 decision over a weak TX 
squad. It was no pitchers battle as 
there was a total of 27 hits made in 
the game. Citcom, with some classy 
playing, won their second game by 
defeating A-4 5 to 0, Arnold of Cit
com gave but 4 hits. Cameron, re
maining in the .000 class, lost to B-l 
to the tune of a 9-1 score. The game, 
promising to be close, went out of

over the DUs, 7 t 6 in what proved 
to be a tight pitchers battle. The 
PiKAs in their appearance of the 
second round, lost to B-3 6 to 5. The 
fraternity men gave up 10 hits to 
the ASTP boys while collecting 15, 
but they couldnt seem to connect 
with men on base. B-5 shut out the 
Delts 3 to 0 behind Scottys magnifi
cent one-hit pitching.
Cameron Hall, seemingly com
pletely routed this session, lost to 
A-5, 2 to 1, in a game halted at the 
end of 6V2 innings because of rain, 
very wet rain. The A-l aggregation 
defeated the Betas 5 to 0 in a game 
which was halted at the end of five 
innings because of rain. A-3 took a 
tight battle from A-4, 2-1. Benko, 
pitching his second four-hit game 
in a week, was the winning pitcher. 
Wunderlich, for A-4, also allowed 
just four hits but was not so fortu
nate in the run column. The PiKA, 
A-2 game down in the bowl was 
completely washed out and will be 
played at a later date, 
and the S.A.E.s, comingfi4nineoJf
Saturday, B-2 defeated B-l, 4 to 2, 
and the S.A.E.s, coming back from 
their previous defeat of the week, 
took a hot game from the Betas 10 
to 9.
The league leaders of the previous 
session, with the exception of Cit
com, appear to be badly shaken. 
Cameron has won none and lost 
three. Citcom can stand improve
ment as it boasts but a .667 percent

game played.

TUESDAY, JULY 13, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
How About A Football Team?
By Chuck Peterson, Sports Editor
The question of the prospect of a 
Tartan football team this coming fall 
has been hashed over many times 
before, but the time has come for 
action, rather than discussion. Every 
school in the country has been hit 
hard by the drain on manpower 
caused by the war, and, many, if not 
most have ben hit harder than Tech. 
Thus we ought to have a team on 
the field to take advantage of the 
easy pickings. The University of 
Pittsburgh, our greatest rival, has 
had a team on the gridiron practic
ing for the past two weeks, and 
there is no reason to believe that we 
here at Tech are not capable of 
doing the same.
It is fairly certain that there are 
and will be enough players on the 
campus from which to form a team, 
then why not get started? Of course 
the very important question of 
coaching facilities has yet to be fac
ed, but we already have part of the 
answer to that question. Joe (Mugsy) Skladany has been an assistant 
coach for the Skibo elevens since 
1937, and is still available as a coach 
for the coming fall. Perhaps, how
ever, he would not be able to devote 
much time to the team this early in 
the season, a fact which would 
throw another barrier in the way of 
starting workouts now. However, 
John Lindberg, stellar varsity tackle 
for the past two seasons, has offered 
a solution to that problem. He has

One of Mushball Race
volunteered to take charge of night
ly workouts, putting the hopefuls 
through calisthenics, blocking drill, 
and signal practice. A team could 
thus be conditioned in a very simple 
manner and be thoroughly ready to 
take the field when the first game 
rolls around next fall.
Therefore, Mr. Overend please 
note, there are no serious difficulties 
in the way of getting the Tartan 
g:;dders on their way. We definitely 
ought to have a team, so lets sec 
some action, NOW!
The civilian teams at Tech still 
have not been able to find sufficient 
room in which to practice during 
the week. Could not something be 
done to correct this situation? The 
Army teams get plenty of practice 
in their many Physical Education 
hours, and this leaves the civilians 
with a handicap at game time. The 
teams from the various departments 
have also found it difficult to find 
fields on which to play, even though 
the physical education department 
has promised them the use of a field 
for their game.

Tau Beta Pi Initiates 
Nine New Members
The initiation of nine of the men 
who were recently elected for Tau 
Beta Pi was held in the Union at 
4:30 on Tuesday, July 6. Following 
the initiation was a banquet at 
which Leo F. Reinarz, manager of 
the Middletown Division of the 
American Rolling Mills Company 
and one of the initiates, was the 
main speaker.
Bob Noyes and Bob Riddell were 
the two honor juniors initiated at 
this time; the third, Rodes Trautman, left for the Naval Reserve at 
Yale University before he was ini
tiated. Senior initiates were Wallace 
Carpenter, Bill Newton, Bob Tofee, 
and James Hamilton. Seniors Bill 
Purcell, Ed Tennyson, and Earl Obringer, who were elected, are now 
serving in the army and were not 
able to attend the initiation.
Emmert Harchelroad, a night 
school student who was elected last 
semester, and Norman Eckler who 
was elected by the Massachusetts 
Epsilon Chapter at Northeastern 
University, were also initiated at 
this time.
Tau Beta Pi is the outstanding 
engineering honorary on the cam
pus. In order to be elected for this 
honor one must be excellent schol
astically and must be engaged in 
extra-curricular activities. We 
heartily congratulate the new ini
tiates.
