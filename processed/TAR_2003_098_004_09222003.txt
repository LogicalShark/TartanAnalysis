ACE Fellow studies CMU administration
by Chris Casinghino
Junior Staffwriter
Normally a stalker is served with 
a restraining order, but the one now 
trailing University President Jared 
Cohon has his own office on the 
fourth floor of Warner Hall. Jeffrey 
Docking, vice president of adminis
tration at Washington and Jefferson 
College, will be shadowing Cohon 
and other key administrators on 
campus over the next four months. 
Docking is participating in the 
American Council on Education 
(ACE) Fellows program which 
allows up-and-coming college and 
university administrators to spend 
time learning important leadership 
skills at other institutions.
While at CMU, he will sit in on 
administrative meetings in an
attempt to learn new skills and gain 
experience in college administra
tion.
Docking, who moved to CMU in 
late August, was nominated for the 
program by Brian Mitchell, the pres
ident of Washington and Jefferson 
College.
Jeff has done wonderful work 
with us, Mitchell said. As he 
begins to focus his attention in other 
areas he will be able to come back to 
Washington and Jefferson with new 
experiences and a broader outlook.
Docking sits in on confidential 
administrative meetings that Cohon 
attends, but is not allowed to discuss 
what occurs during those meetings.
The program condenses years of 
on-the-job experience and skills 
development into a single semester 
or year, Docking said. I am a fly on 
the wall at key meetings of adminis
trative groups on campus as well as 
other meetings around the region. 
Carnegie Mellon is an excellent 
place for an ACE Fellow to learn 
about university administration, 
according to Cohon.
This is a particularly interesting 
place to see administration hap
pen, said Cohon. We are quick to 
change ... and ACE Fellows can real
ly see things happening here.
One other ACE Fellow, Steven 
Michael, a professor and adminis
trator from Kent State University, 
has spent his Fellowship at Carnegie 
Mellon during Cohons administra
tion.
He claims it was an extremely 
valuable year for him, said Cohon.
I quickly came to understand 
why this is a world-class institution, 
said Docking of his first three weeks. 
People at CMU blend high intelli
gence and sophistication with gen
uine warmth and congeniality. I 
have felt very at home here.
ACE Fellows are selected yearly 
after a rigorous application process. 
They must then apply to the presi
dent of the institution at which they 
would like to serve their Fellowship.
Cohon said Carnegie Mellon 
accepts ACE Fellows in part to be 
helpful and supportive of the ACE 
Fellows program. I think its a good 
program. Weve had one of our staff 
members, Susan Ambrose, be a 
Fellow.
Ambrose is currently director of 
the Eberly Center for Teaching 
Excellence and principal lecturer in 
the department of history. She 
spent her fellowship at Connecticut 
College and the University of Rhode

Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist joins H&SS
Contemporary Journalism undergoes professional treatment
by Hannah Yi
Staffwriter
The new adjunct associate profes
sor of journalism walked in ten min
utes before the start of class carrying 
a bundle of newspapers with a 
leather bag slung over his shoulders. 
Dressed in a shirt and tie after a day 
of work at the Pittsburgh PostGazette, Thomas OBoyle laid out his 
folders and papers as 17 of his stu
dents walked in for the three-hourlong class Contemporary Journalism 
(76-372).
This fall semester, OBoyle filled 
the vacant position left by Jim 
Davidson, his predecessor of nine 
years. Davidson resigned last semes
ter to become ordained by the 
Presbyterian Church (USA).
Davidson had been with us a 
number of years, said Karen 
Schnakenberg, the director of pro
fessional and technical writing. 
When he announced that he would 
leave, we knew we had to find some
one roughly equivalent to him.
Rumors of an open position got 
around by word of mouth within the 
small journalism community of 
Pittsburgh. Eight people expressed 
interest in the job, but only three 
were called back for an interview, 
which was conducted by 
Schnakenberg, Davidson, and David 
Kaufer, head of the English depart
ment. Input was also solicited from 
the students about what they 
thought was invaluable to the 
course and what fundamental traits 
they looked for in a professor.
The students proposed the same 
qualities we looked for, said 
Schnakenberg. We required two 
main things: first, a very experi
enced journalist who was working 
the field with current contacts, and 
second, someone who could teach.
Experience in journalism does not 
necessarily mean ease and effective
ness in teaching the craft. The inter
viewers Were wary to look for some
one who not only had a full compli
ment of credentials but also an ade
quate background in teaching.
You find many journalists who 
have been in the business but never 
taught before, said Kaufer. We 
needed someone who could be a 
pedagogue that would break down
the course into teachable sequences 
for students. Davidson is a tough act 
to follow, but OBoyle had the right 
mix of a journalism and teaching 
background.
OBoyles previous three years of 
experience as the journalism 
instructor at Duquesne University 
was a green light. He also worked 
for The Wall Street Journal, where he 
reported on and wrote more than 50 
front page articles over the course of
11 years.
The Journal has its own way of 
training journalists, said 
Schnakenberg. The stint on the 
Journal on his resume was very 
important.
OBoyle also wrote a book, At Any 
Cost: Jack Welch, General Electric, 
and the Pursuit of Profit, which was 
published in 1998 by Alfred Knopf. It 
has been reprinted in soft-cover 
twice and translated into four lan
guages.
According to Schnakenberg, 
Knopf is a prominent and indemand publisher.
On top of teaching this semester, 
OBoyle currently works full time at 
the Post-Gazette as the circulation 
marketing manager. Juggling both 
his responsibilities at the PostGazette and those for his class cre
ates a pressure similar to that of 
working on a deadline.
Its a little stressful, but Im used 
to dealing with stress as a journal
ist, said OBoyle. I kind of like it. 
Classes are held once a week on 
Thursdays, which doesnt encroach 
too much on his work throughout 
the week.
Its stimulating, fun, and I like 
doing it all at once in a three-hour 
gag slot, said OBoyle. Theres an 
intensity in it. We can take on an 
entire topic and feel like were really 
biting into it. In most cases, the pro
fessors done clearing his throat in 
80 minutes, but we have a good 
amount of time.
It was a rocky start for most stu
dents; it took time for them to adjust 
to the three-hour class.
Its hard enough staying focused 
in an hour-twenty class, said Corey 
Ginsberg, a senior creative writing 
major. But it seems like its getting 
better.

HUB stumbles on start of semester
by John Davin
Contributing Editor
At the beginning of every year, one 
of the familiar back-to-school rituals 
for Carnegie Mellon students is stand
ing in long lines at the HUB. This ye^r, 
long lines were not the only frustra
tions that greeted students.
They charged me a late fee and I 
havent even signed up for classes, 
said Salim Mawani, a masters student 
in information systems management.
He said that the HUB thought he was 
a full-time student even though he 
had sent them an e-mail saying that 
he was a part-time student and there
fore should not be billed for full 
tuition. Like other students, Mawani 
also found the lines at the HUB to be 
aggravating.
I think the problem here is that I 
had to wait here 30 minutes, said 
Mawani.
Sometimes theyre rather misinformative about things you need to

SCS Dean Morris to step down at end of next semester
by Andrew Johnson
Editor-in-Chief
After completing a five-year term 
at the end of the spring 2004, James 
Morris will step down as Dean of the 
School of Computer Science and 
return to teaching and research. 
Morris has received much praise for 
his administrative work. During his 
tenure, the schools research rev
enues have increased by 50 percent 
and the school now has a budget of 
over $100 million.
Morris also headed the initiative 
to form the West Coast branch of 
CMU. With a heavy CMU alumni
presence in Silicon Valley, the cam
pus creation was part of one of his 
larger goals of strengthening alumni 
ties to the School. The West Coast 
campus just held its first graduation 
ceremony.
Along with his external relations 
role and beyond his impact on the 
growth of research, Morris is credit
ed by the associate dean of SCS 
Peter Lee, as being a big believer in 
undergraduate education.
He should get a lot of credit for 
the many improvements that have 
taken place in the last five years, 
said Lee. He was pretty tireless, 
going all over the country to be pre
sent at alumni events.
Lee said Morris believed in 
emphasizing student satisfaction, 
and also in broadening computer 
science to include not only super
hackers, but also those who had 
interests in things such as politics or 
literature.
Agata Bugaj, a senior computer 
science student, worked with Morris 
on planning SCS Day, an event that 
showcased all of the talents of SCS. 
Morris emceed the event.
He was great. He was very enthu
siastic about the event, she said, 
adding that he always seemed very 
on top of things and well-prepared.
It is unknown who the next dean 
will be, though Morris said that
Provost Mark Kamlet is appointing a 
committee to look into it.
Morris said he enjoyed his term as 
dean, and that he enjoyed advancing 
the institution.
Not only was I an undergrad at 
CMU, but I am also a native 
Pittsburgher, he said. He will not, 
however, miss the myriad meetings 
he often faced where the purpose 
was not clear, or worse, those meet
ings where the person wanted some
thing, he said.
Morris said he used to teach 
Fundamental Data Structures and 
Algorithms (15-211), and might go. 
back to teaching that course, but he 
also has interests in teaching classes
related to Human-Computer 
Interaction. Some of his research 
interests also lie in this direction.
On November 10, Morris will 
emcee the ceremony that inducts the 
first group of robots and their inven
tors into a project he conceived, the 
Robot Hall of Fame.
With the Robotics Institute, CMU 
is the center of robotics, said Morris, 
adding that this joint project of CMU 
and the Carnegie Science Center will 
help spotlight this region.
As he returns to teaching, Morris 
said he will continue to tend to 
administrative duties, but on a vol
unteer basis. He may also write a 
book.
Athletics to 
fill vacant 
SID position
Since early July and into the foot
ball season, the Carnegie Mellon 
sports community has lacked a Sports 
Information Director (SID). After the 
previous director resigned to accept a 
position at her church, a hiring freeze 
was enacted, preventing the search 
and hiring of a replacement.
William Elliott, vice president of 
enrollment, lifted the freeze on 
September 12, according to Athletic 
Director John Harvey. Officials from 
the athletics and media relations 
departments, which jointly oversee 
the SID position, have begun looking 
for a new SID.
Im not aware of any hiring freeze 
on the [SID] position, said Teresa 
Thomas, assistant vice president of 
media relations.
I would say were going to [hire 
someone] pretty quickly because we 
need someone, said Harvey. The 
application process began over the 
summer though no recruitment was 
done due to the hiring freeze, accord
ing to Harvey. Thomas said an inter
est in rewriting the SID job descrip
tion derailed active recruitment over 
the summer.
We have a number of resumes, 
simply through word of mouth. John 
Harvey and I believe we can move to 
fill the position quickly, said 
Thomas. According to Harvey, there 
are already three or four top candi
dates and the athletics department 
hopes to hire a new SID in approxi
mately three weeks. However, the 
department is still looking for appli
cants.
Were going to need a solid sports 
writer with an appreciation for the 
academic side of things, Thomas 
said.
The lack of an SID has been a bur
den on the athletics department but 
did not cause any major problems, 
according to Harvey.
I think weve been slowed up, he 
said. We have been attempting to 
keep up with the work of that posi
tion. Its put us in a hole because we 
dont have the expertise.
It took me a little longer to report 
not just scores, but [also] write-ups 
[to major newspapers], said Harvey. 
Also, weve been a little slow getting 
stuff into the University Athletic 
Association.
Overall, the lack of an SID has not 
been too much trouble, according to 
Harvey.
People here have been holding up 
pretty well, he said.
The intramural sports program was 
less affected by the SID vacancy, 
according to Mike Grzywinski CMUs 
assistant intramural director.
The effect on intramurals is not 
very much right now, he said. We 
handle our own publicity through 
The Tartan by sending in the IM News 
each week. -
. The SID helps us get our brochure 
out at the start of the school year but 
we usually do that work in early May 
(before the last SID left for another 
job) so it is ready for the freshman 
packet, Grzywinski said.

Putin decries U.S. 
handling of Iraq
MOSCOW (AP)  Americas fail
ure to stabilize Iraq has left Russian 
President Vladimir Putin convinced 
he was right: The war was a bad idea. 
That conviction has boosted Putins 
confidence, and at their summit this 
week, President Bush will encounter 
a man willing to challenge America 
on Iraq, Iran, and even the war on ter
rorism.
Before meeting Bush at Camp 
David later this week, Putin will 
address the UN General Assembly 
meeting that will focus on Iraqs 
future. With Washington seeking to 
maintain its hold on administrating 
the country, the Russian leader insist
ed over the weekend that the United 
Nations must have a real role, not a 
decorative role in Iraq.
Germany, France, and Britain have 
also called for more authority for the 
world body in Iraq, as Washington 
debates with its allies over a new UN 
resolution. British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, however, has not joined 
Frances call for a handover of power 
to Iraqi authorities within months, 
backing the U.S. stance against what 
he calls a too-hasty transfer.
Putin says hes ready to negotiate 
 and ready to be blunt about 
Russias stance.
During a four-hour interview with 
a group of U.S. reporters that lasted 
until early Saturday evening, the stiff
ness that characterized Putins early 
meetings with Western media was 
gone. It was replaced by boldness, 
even spontaneity and an occasional 
phrase in English. His tone was harsh 
when it came to his least favorite sub
ject: the war in Chechnya.
Putins way of responding to ques
tions on Russian conduct over Iraq, 
Iran, and Chechnya is to accuse the 
West of acting improperly. Such feints 
draw attention away from the ques
tion but they are not very illuminat
ing.
Russia strongly opposed the war in 
Iraq, and Putin said that Russias posi
tion hadnt changed, and that the sit
uation that is developing in Iraq is the 
best confirmation that Russia was 
right.
Putin said his relationship with 
Bush was strong enough that they 
could express their views bluntly 
and say things the other might not 
like. But we listen to each other and 
we are looking for a solution, he 
said.
Putin defended Russias nuclear 
cooperation with Iran, saying his 
country was doing all it could to 
make sure Russias nuclear assistance 
could not be used to help Iran devel
op nuclear weapons.
Then, he turned on the West, 
accusing it of double standards, say
ing Russia had evidence that Western 
companies, including American ones, 
were selling so-called dual use tech
nologies, material that can be used 
for peaceful, as well as military, pur
poses. In answering questions about 
Chechnya, Putin also lashed out at 
the United States. He had scathing 
words for Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of State Steven Pifer, who last week 
warned that Kremlin policy in 
Chechnya may be among the most 
troubling issues at the summit.
Envoy seeks Nobel 
laureates release
YANGON, Myanmar (AP)  An 
Indonesian envoy arrived in 
Myanmar Sunday in a fresh effort to 
seek the release of detained pro
democracy leader and Nobel Peace 
Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Suu Kyi, 58, is currently recovering 
in a private Yangon hospital after 
being admitted last week for what 
was described as major surgery, but 
has not been allowed visitors. Doctors 
have declined to give details about 
her operation.
Her personal physician, Tin Myo 
Win, said Sunday that she was well, 
and able to eat solid food for the first 
time since surgery.
Former Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas told reporters he 
had been sent to Myanmar as a spe
cial envoy by President Megawati 
Sukarnoputri. He declined to provide 
details about his visit.
But Alatas is expected to convey 
the growing concerns among the 10- 
nation Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations about Suu Kyis detention. 
Myanmars fellow ASEAN members 
have been reluctant to criticize the 
military regime.
Myanmars ruling junta, already 
shunned by many Western nations 
because of its poor human rights 
record, was further isolated when it 
detained Suu Kyi in May after she and 
her followers were caught in a violent 
clash with a pro-government mob in 
northern Myanmar.
Since then, Suu Kyi, who won the 
1991 Nobel Prize, has been held at an 
undisclosed location, despite appeals 
from world leaders for her release. 
The junta has said she will be freed, 
but have refused to specify when.
9/11 mastermind 
deposition revealed
WASHINGTON (AP)  Khalid 
Shaikh Mohammed, mastermind of 
the September 11 attacks, has told 
American interrogators that he first 
discussed the plot with Osama bin 
Laden in 1996 and that the original 
plan called for hijacking five commer
cial jets on each U.S. coast before it 
was modified several times, accord
ing to interrogation reports reviewed 
by The Associated Press.
Mohammed also divulged that, in 
its final stages, the hijacking plan 
called for as many as 22 terrorists and 
four planes in a first wave, followed 
by a second wave of suicide hijack
ings that were to be aided possibly by 
al-Qaida allies in Southeast Asia, 
according to the reports.
Over time, bin Laden scrapped var
ious parts of the September 11 plan, 
including attacks on both coasts and 
hijacking or bombing some planes in 
East Asia, Mohammed is quoted as 
saying in reports that shed new light 
on the origins and evolution of the 
plot of September 11, 2001.
Addressing one of the questions 
raised by congressional investigators 
in their September 11 review, 
Mohammed said he never heard of a 
Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi 
who provided some rent money and 
assistance to two hijackers when they 
arrived in California.
Congressional investigators have 
suggested Bayoumi could have aided 
the hijackers or been a Saudi intelli
gence agent, charges the Saudi gov
ernment vehemently deny. The FBI 
has also cast doubt on the congres
sional theory after extensive investi
gation and several interviews with alBayoumi.
In fact, Mohammed claims he did 
not arrange for anyone on U.S. soil to 
assist hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar 
and Nawaf al-Hazmi when they
arrived in California. Mohammed 
said there were no al-Qaida opera
tives or facilitators in the United 
States to help al-Mihdhar or al-Hazmi 
settle in the United States, one of the 
reports states.
Mohammed said he communicated 
with al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar while 
they were in the United States by 
using Internet chat software, the 
report states.
Mohammed said al-Hazmi and alMihdhar were among the four origi
nal operatives bin Laden assigned to 
him for the plot, a significant revela
tion because those were the only two 
hijackers whom U.S. authorities were 
frantically seeking for terrorist ties in 
the final days before September 11.
The interrogation reports make 
dramatically clear that Mohammed 
and al-Qaida were still actively look
ing to strike U.S., European, and 
Israeli targets across the world as of 
this year.
Gates gives $168M 
to malaria research
MANHICA, Mozambique (AP)  
Touring a malaria clinic where they 
sat on reed mats while coddling 
babies, Bill and Melinda Gates 
announced a $168 million grant 
Sunday to accelerate research into 
malaria, a disease that kills over a 
million people each year, most of 
them young African children.
The grant, by the worlds richest 
man and his wife, is the largest ever 
single donation towards fighting the 
mosquito-borne disease. Malaria is 
making a deadly comeback in Africa, 
the worlds poorest continent, as 
strains of the disease become increas
ingly resistant to treatment.
Funding from the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation is for three 
research grants, with $100 million to 
go towards finding a vaccine, $28 
million to use existing drugs to cut 
down the number of infections in 
babies, and $40 million for the devel
opment of new medicines to combat 
drug-resistant strains.

Gene linked to 
binge drinking
(U-WIRE) LAWRENCE, Kan.  
Blame your parents for that hang
over you had last weekend  binge 
drinking could be in your genes.
In a study released this month, 
college students with a particular 
version of a common gene tended to 
have more harmful drinking habits 
than students with a different ver
sion.
Researchers say the link could 
possibly lead to future medications 
for those with a drinking problem.
Obviously its going to take a lot 
more work, says Paolo D. 
DePetrillo, National Institute on 
Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse clini
cal investigator and co-author of the 
study.
For the study, researchers sur
veyed 204 male and female 
Caucasian college students, all 
between the ages of 17 and 23. The 
participants answered questions 
about their drinking habits and pro
vided saliva samples.
Researchers used the saliva to 
look for the serotonin transporter 
gene known as 5HTT. The gene is 
responsible for recycling serotonin 
in the brain. DePetrillo says that this 
gene was targeted because of its 
known connection to anxiety.
Everyone is born with either short 
or long versions of this gene. This 
leaves the possibility of three combi
nations: two long strands, two short
strands or one long and one short 
strand.
Researchers with the NIAAA 
found that binge drinking was more 
prevalent in students who had two 
short strands of the gene. These stu
dents reported binge drinking twice 
as often as students with different 
forms, DePetrillo says.
This isnt to suggest that 5HTT is 
the only gene involved with the 
binge drinking habit, DePetrillo 
says. But the research does prove a 
strong relationship that could lead 
to a possible cure for serotonin 
imbalance.
Binge drinking, defined as five 
drinks in a sitting for men and four 
drinks for women, is a common 
problem on college campuses.

Georgetown University was 
closed Thursday and Friday, all 
classes were canceled, and student 
clubs suspended their activities in 
anticipation of the storm, a category 
two hurricane that brought exten
sive wind and rain to the District 
early yesterday before the arrival of 
the hurricane around 2 am this 
morning.
The National Weather Service 
had a tropical storm warning in 
effect for the Chesapeake Bay area 
from Smith Point northward, which 
includes the tidal Potomac River 
area.
After making landfall off the 
Outer Banks in North Carolina, the 
storm moved north through Virginia 
and Maryland before continuing 
through Pennsylvania and as far 
north as Quebec.
Washington D.C. Mayor Anthony 
Williams declared a state of emer

Wednesday afternoon in anticipa
tion of localized flooding, heavy 
rain and winds of up to 60 mph that 
are predicted to continue today as a 
result of the storm. The Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority 
suspended Metrobus and Metrorail 
operations Thursday beginning at 
11 am.
Heavy rainfall in the spring and 
summer has left the ground water
logged, which increased chances for 
flooding along the riverfront, local 
authorities have warned.
University officials had been

to take.
UPMC to bring 
services to Italy
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A hospital 
venture between the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center and its 
Italian partners will bring medical 
care to poorly served parts of Italy.
UPMC is footing the bill for about 
25 nurses, doctors, technicians and 
administrators while Italy is paying 
for construction of a 70-bed hospital 
in Sicily. The $55 million hospital is 
scheduled to open next March.
The hospital will be known as 
UPMC Mediterranean Institute for 
Transplantation and Advanced 
Specialized Therapies and will be 
home to a program intended to serve 
as an organ-transplant center in 
southern Italy.
Officials say the hospital will boost 
UPMCs prestige overseas.
Rendell asks US 
Airways for jobs
PITTSBURGH (AP)  Gov. Ed 
Rendell wants US Airways to guaran
tee jobs in exchange for the states 
help in lowering the cost of doing 
business at Pittsburgh International 
Airport, but the airline contends that 
it cannot make that promise.
Rendell said he will not rely on 
increasing taxes to generate a $500 
million debt reduction sought by US 
Airways at its southwestern 
Pennsylvania hub, with nearly 400 
daily departures.
Were certainly not going to wipe 
out the debt using direct tax dollars, 
Rendell said Friday during a news 
conference in Harrisburg. First of all, 
that doesnt make sense. Second, its 
not the right thing for the taxpayers 
of Pennsylvania or the citizens of 
Pittsburgh.
US Airways spokesman David 
Castelveter declined to comment on 
the airlines plan to use hotel, sales, 
and car rental taxes to raise $31 mil
lion a year to pay down debt. US 
Airways wants a $500 million reduc
tion in the $673 million it owes bond
holders for the construction of 
Pittsburgh International.
The airline currently pays about 
$50 million a year.
US Airways has opposed job and 
flight guarantees because they would 
restrict its ability to react to react to 
industry ups and downs, airline offi
cials said.
The airline abruptly canceled its 
leases and contracts on March 31, just 
before it exited bankruptcy protec
tion. The cancellation is effective Jan. 
5 and US Airways Chief Executive 
David Siegel has said the carrier is 
prepared to leave Pittsburgh as a hub 
if it does not get a better deal.
Allegheny County Chief Executive 
Jim Roddey ruled out the use of tax 
money and said he will demand job 
guarantees during the next meeting 
between the airline and government 
officials, anticipated to occur in 
October.
Despite ongoing negotiations, the 
airlines hub in Pittsburgh could be 
doomed if the carrier continues to 
remain unprofitable, Roddey told a 
gathering of local leaders Friday in 
Richland.
News Oddities
Fifty-nine-yearold man joins frat
(U-WIRE) PULLMAN, Wash.  
David Blue Waterstraat doesnt 
see what the big deal is  hes just 
another fraternity member.
NBCs The Today Show, how
ever, seems to disagree.
Reporters from the national 
morning program will visit WSU 
next week to tape a segment about 
the 59-year-old Blue.
Blue, who joined Phi Kappa 
Sigma in early July, received pub
licity in The Daily Evergreens Aug. 
19 issue and was featured in the 
Spokesman Review last week. 
Producers at Today saw the 
Evergreen article while sorting 
through human-interest stories, 
and contacted Blue the next week.
I was really surprised, he said. 
My first reaction was disbelief.
Today5 told Blue it plans to film 
for two days to capture the life of 
an almost-60-year-old returning 
student who discovered Greek life.
Its a unique story, Kapp said. 
We are always looking for stories 
or events that convey inspiration 
or entertainment to our viewers.
Blue, who earned his nickname 
from a character in the movie Old 
School, led an enterprising life 
before coming to Pullman, Wash.
Originally from Spencerport, 
N.Y., Blue spent 12 years in the 
Marines as a translator.
Blue got involved with the Phi 
Kaps after seeing an associate 
member at My Offices steak night.
He was introduced to other mem
bers and made a visit to the frater
nity house, where he was asked to 
join. My primary goal here is to 
get an education and get back out 
to the work market, Blue said. If I 
have a little fun while Im here, I 
have no objection to that.
Flash mobs make 
people confused
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis.  
Hundreds of people walked into an 
Irish pub in New York City on July 
24, swarmed around the jukebox 
and began chirping like birds. 
Within five minutes, the crowd 
had disappeared completely, exit
ing the bar just as quickly as they 
had appeared. Was it some sort of 
strange new club dedicated to 
bringing the music of birds to the 
general public? Perhaps it was 
some sort of Prohibition-type 
movement to scare patrons out of 
bars?
No, the jukebox incident was 
just the latest spectacle in a fastgrowing trend known as flash 
mobs.
Part performance art, part sur
prise party, and mostly just for fun, 
flash mobs are socially organized 
events meant to confuse and 
bewilder the general public, usual
ly organized using cell phones, 
pagers, and e-mails.
Created by a mysterious individ
ual known only as Bill from New 
York, flash mobs came into exis
tence this past summer and have 
already been spotted everywhere 
from San Francisco to Minneapolis 
and even as far as Europe.

SCS receives $7M 
grant from DARPA
The Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) has award
ed Carnegie Mellons School of 
Computer Science (SCS) a $7 million 
contract to develop the software for a 
personal cognitive assistant. 
Nicknamed project RADAR for 
Reflective Agents with Distributed 
Adaptive Reasoning, the team that is 
developing the software hopes that 
the final product will be able to assist 
managers with menial, day-to-day 
tasks like scheduling meetings, 
addressing routine e-mail messages, 
and offering appropriate responses to 
other e-mail messages.
Project RADAR is part of a larger 
program called Personal Assistant 
that Learns (PAL) being funded by 
DARPA and handled by DARPAs 
Information Processing Technology 
Office (IPTO), which also manages 
the Internet, the offspring of the 
IPTOs ARPANet, and other largescale, critical computing technolo
gies. The program ultimately hopes to 
develop software that can aid man
agers in handling some of the more 
complex decisions that they face, 
decisions which must often be made 
in conjunction with other decisions.
Should the program prove a suc
cess, its implications will extend far 
beyond the realm of cognitive assis
tants. Computers could be engi
neered that became more compliant 
with their users needs over time, and 
which would also be superior at han
dling unexpected errors and input 
than computers of current design.
DARPA has also awarded SRI 
International a contract for the PAL 
project in the amount of $22 million. 
SRIs project is called CALO, which 
stands for Cognitive Assistant that 
Learns and Observes, and will devel
op software that can handle interre
lated decisions and unexpected 
events by learning from and working
with its users. The SRI contract 
includes a subcontract with Carnagie 
Mellon.
The investigators at CMU hope to 
run several tests with project RADAR 
to illustrate the effectiveness of'the 
software. Daniel P. Siewiorek, direc
tor of Carnegie Mellons HunianComputer Interaction Institute and 
one of the principal investigators for 
project RADAR, said, With each task, 
well run experiments to see how \vell 
people do by themselves and m,ake 
comparisons. We will also look at 
people plus a human assistant,and 
compare that to the software agent.
Principal Research Computer 
Scientist Scott Fahlman, another 
principal investigator for the project, 
said about the challenges facing the 
project: The key scientific challenge 
in this work is to endow RADAR with 
enough flexibility and general knowl
edge to handle tasks of this nature," 
said Fahlman. "Like any good assis
tant, RADAR must understand, its 
human master's activities and prefer
ences and how they change over 
time.
ICEC held for the 
first time in U.S.
tThe International Conference on 
Electronic Commerce (ICEC) will be

Janitors to lobby 
for fringe benefits
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  After 
negotiating a new contract with the 
University of Pittsburgh, the workers 
in the purple shirts are back, and 
this time, they're going downtown.
On Oct. 31, the contract for the 
approximately 1,000 Service 
Employees International Union jani
tors, who clean many of the offices 
downtown, expires. So SEIU, the 
union that includes Pitt's custodians 
and grounds crew, is organizing the 
Downtown Contract Campaign to 
support their interests.
Wednesday night, Tom Hoffman, 
SEIU's spokesperson, and Jim Bird, a 
custodian and SEIU steward for the 
One Mellon Center building, met 
with Students in Solidarity to dis
cuss their issues and plans for the 
campaign.
Hoffman said that, although SEIU 
supports the fight for a living wage, 
the main focus of the campaign is 
obtaining affordable health care 
coverage, particularly for families.
According to an SEIU news 
release, 15 percent of workers in 
Allegheny County making between 
$20,000 and $30,000 go without 
health care coverage because they 
cannot afford the premiums.
William Modoono, spokesman for 
UPMC Health Plan, said the rising 
cost of health care affects all parts of 
the country. He explained that 
health care costs are rising in 
response to emerging technologies 
that can better prevent and treat ill
nesses, rising pharmacy costs 
prompted by better drugs and 
increased direct advertising, and the 
region's aging population.
The SEIU Downtown contract 
campaign is part of the union's larg
er Justice for Janitors campaign, 
which works for affordable health 
care and janitors' interests in cities 
around the country. Hoffman said 
that, during the spring, SEIU sup
ported a strike in Boston and 
obtained health care for 600 jani
tors.
He added that, though SEIU work
ers at Pitt had recently accepted a 
contract with enough of a wage 
increase to cushion their rising 
health care costs, some appeared at 
last week's convention to show their 
support.
Study shows high 
stress in college
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  Stress, 
a non-specific response of the body 
to a demand, has increased among 
college students in the last few 
years, according to recent reports 
about college students' mental 
health.
Mental illness  sometimes a 
severe result of stress  among col
lege students has climbed to 20 per
cent, making it close to that of the 
general population, according to 
U.S. News and World Report.
But don't burn your books and 
book a flight for Tahiti just yet. 
James Cox, interim director of 
University of Pittsburgh Counseling 
Services said the report is not cause 
for alarm, but simply concern.
Cox is particularly concerned 
about the cause of rising stress levels 
among seniors, he said, since recent 
reports focus mainly on freshmen's 
mental health.
"People often think of freshmen, 
but our data shows that, increasing
ly, seniors are stressed," said Cox.
Data from Counseling Services 
during the last three years shows a 5 
percent drop in freshmen seeking 
the services, while the number of 
seniors seeking help has risen by 10 
percent.
"The question is, 'why is this hap
pening?"' Cox said. "If the problem is 
internal, we can fix it. But if it is 
external, what can we do?"
The internal stresses Cox 
described often arise from common 
stress-inducing issues in students' 
lives, ranging from relationships to 
academic problems.
External stresses, on the other 
hand, can develop from a high 
unemployment rate, a struggling 
economy or the threat of war.
"It is much harder to help the stu
dents," Cox said, referring to exter
nal problems. "I saw a student yes
terday who - I don't think he knows 
how he can pay for next semester. 
And that's got to be really stressful."
While Cox couldn't say for certain 
that the problem is because of recent 
economic pressures on students, he 
suggested that anxiety about money 
has risen with students' ambitions 
for higher education.
More than ever, students hold out
side jobs or carry multiple majors, 
according to Cox.
Cox pointed out that seniors who 
are entering the job market have 
fewer options.

FBI, DOJ attend civil liberties talk
Area experts debate effects of USA Patriot Act and current state of library privacy rights.Minor mistakes plague The HUB

Junior Staffwriter
Last Tuesday, the League of 
Women Voters of Greater Pittsburgh 
and the Allegheny County Library 
Association collaborated to host Civil 
Liberties: A Free Public Forum at the 
Rodef Shalom Congregation on Fifth 
Avenue in Oakland. Moe Coleman, 
director emmeritus from the Institute 
of Politics at the University of 
Pittsburgh, moderated the discussion 
of six panelists.
Attended by over a hundred guests, 
the main topic in the two-hour forum 
was how the civil liberties of 
Americans have been affected since 
the controversial Patriot Act legisla
tion was passed by Congress in 
October 2001. Each speaker was 
allowed a five-minute monologue to 
explain his or her views.
After their monologues, panelists 
were allowed to question other pan
elists. Finally, the moderator chose 
five questions supplied by the audi
ence and summarized each panelists 
argument while giving his own input 
on their views.
Several issues were discussed, 
most notably the issue of the federal 
governments detaining suspects, 
witnesses, and persons of interest 
in the war on terrorism.
Over 12,000 aliens were impris
oned for over 24 hours without 
access to communication and with
out right to counsel, and none of 
those were even charged with a crime 
relating to terrorism, said panelist 
Jules Lobel, a professor of law at the 
University of Pittsburgh. Many were 
even held for months, some cases 
over a year. The government used the 
term enemy combatants to hold U.S. 
citizens for over a year without charg
ing them. After the Patriot Act, they 
can just pick any one of us and you 
have no rights and can remain indefi
nitely in solitary confinement.
Panelist Mary Beth Buchanan, a 
United States Attorney for the 
Western District of Pennsylvania, dis
puted Lobels statistics.
There are not 12,000, but 763 
aliens detained, and over 500 were 
illegal aliens charged on other offens
es. No one has ever been detained
indefinitely. That has never been 
used, she said.
Vic Walczak, a panelist and the 
legal director of the Pittsburgh chap
ter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, asked why the federal govern
ment would not reveal the number of 
suspects being tried in war tribunals 
or so-called secret courts.
We dont disclose because that 
information is classified, said 
Buchanan. The audience erupted 
into boos after Buchanans response.
Under the Patriot Act, the infor
mation is provided to Congress, said 
Buchanan. She later explained that 
some information should remain 
confidential so potential terrorists 
and criminals are not aware of law 
enforcement progress.
Another highlight was the conflict 
between the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ) and the American
We need a better way of 
explaining why some things 
are classified and we need a 
better way of explaining 
issues to the public.
 Mary Beth Buchanan
Library Association (ALA). According 
to panelist Cynthia Richey, director of 
the Mt. Lebanon Public Library and 
President of the Association for 
Library Service to Children, the DOJ 
is potentially violating peoples right 
to privacy by demanding that 
libraries keep personal information 
and records of its users so the DOJ 
can request it at any time.
Our library was created on the 
belief all people should have free 
access to information, said Richey. 
Our policy safeguards the First 
Amendment right and free access to 
information without intimidation or 
incrimination. Without a court order, 
we must protect confidentiality of all 
users. Were bound by law not to 
divulge information without court 
orders. Based on my experience, just 
because a person checks out a book 
or views a website does not necessar
ily mean he agrees with what he
views.
Richey also explained it was almost 
impossible to start keeping records 
since the computer programs used 
cleaned their logs routinely.
Panelist Erin Beckman, a supervi
sory special agent of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, Pittsburgh 
Division, said that not allowing the 
government quick access to those 
files would make libraries a refuge for 
terrorists. Richey said that libraries 
would only comply with proper sub
poenas from judges.
Attorney General John Ashcrofts 
effectiveness was also discussed, and 
he was not spared any criticism. 
Walczak said Ashcroft behaved in a 
manner similar to a monarch and 
accused him of using executive 
orders to undermine the federal judi
cial branch. During an interview after 
the forums conclusion, he suggested 
things that Ashcroft could do to ease 
the publics fear of losing their civil 
liberties.
He should resign, said Walczak.
Panelist Dennis Roddy, a columnist 
and reporter for the Pittsburgh PostGazette, also ridiculed Ashcroft for 
making crude public comments about 
his detractors like the ALA while 
rarely addressing them directly.
Countering this criticism of 
Ashcroft from several panelists, 
Beckman said, The media [are] one
sided. A lot of reporters dont show 
the Justice Departments side.
Despite the debate, all the pan
elists agreed that each side was mak
ing better efforts in communicating 
and understanding each other.
I understand the concern because 
of this forum, said Buchanan. We 
need a better way of explaining why 
some things are classified and we 
need a better way of explaining issues 
to the public.
Jean Burke, the head of the League 
of Women Voters of Greater 
Pittsburgh, expressed satisfaction 
with the discussion, despite unal
tered concerns that the Patriot Act 
has negatively impacted peoples 
right to privacy and their civil liber
ties.
Our basic purpose was getting out 
information, Burke said. Were an 
educational organization and we 
want informed voters.
HUB, from page Al
do, said Ben Magallon, an anthro
pology junior who had initially been 
told his account would be balanced, 
but was recently told that he still 
owes $2500.
During the first and second weeks 
of classes, students were unable to 
get refund checks due to a glitch in 
the computer systems. A sign posted 
outside The HUB stated that refund 
checks were temporarily unavail
able. According to Linda Anderson 
and John Papinchak, co-directors of 
Enrollment Services, the software 
that automatically issues refunds 
was modified during the first week 
of classes. However, the new code 
had problems, prompting 
Enrollment Services to stop issuance 
of refund checks for three days.
The software system controlling 
refund checks is programmed to 
issue checks whenever a students 
account has a credit balance and 
meets certain criteria.
The process takes into account 
federal regulations, loan regula
tions, cash management, and audit 
regulations, said Anderson. The 
modifications to the software were 
designed to relax the restrictions on 
automatic issuance of refund checks 
to allow more students to get checks 
without going to The HUB to request 
them.
We were trying to expand the 
pool so more students would get 
automatic refund checks, said 
Papinchak. According to Anderson, 
between 7500 and 8000 checks are 
issued in the first two weeks of the 
school year. Some students are 
issued multiple checks because they 
may have credits from scholarships 
or loans that post at different times 
after the school year begins. The 
automatic refund system has been in 
place since March 2002.
Enrollment Services has received 
additional questions from students 
in the past several months regarding 
the student health insurance charge.
SID, from page Al

and was available on The HUB web
site. Enrollment Services also 
increased the maximum allowable 
outstanding account balance at 
which a student can enroll in classes 
to $814, the amount of the health 
insurance charge. This helped stu
dents avoid losing enrollment status 
if they forgot to have the insurance 
charge waived.
Some students were incorrectly 
charged a CampusXpress activation 
fee even though they had already 
joined the program in a previous 
year. According to Papinchak and 
Anderson, a new CampusXpress 
billing system was put in place over 
the summer. However, upgrading to 
the new system caused the records 
of students past enrollment in 
CampusXpress to get left behind in 
the old system.
As a result, some students were 
mistakenly charged a $15 
CampusXpress activation fee. The 
HUB assistant directors have been 
entering refunds for students who 
were incorrectly charged, and the
gram this summer, said Thomas.
According to Thomas, the SID

Despite glitches, most students 
are satisfied with the service at The

ble towards the students, said 
Jenny Cheng, a junior in biology.
I think theyre pretty helpful, just 
the lines are pretty long, said Ariel 
Levavi, sophomore in mathematics. 
To help with the early semester rush, 
The HUB had a separate line for stu
dents picking up refund checks.
Enrollment Services is working on 
several initiatives to offer more ser
vices online. They hope to eventual
ly allow direct deposit or on-campus 
mailing of student refund checks. 
However, it will be at least a year 
before all the issues can be worked 
out and the new changes put into 
effect. They would also like to offer 
online ordering of official tran
scripts so that students would not 
have to go to The HUB to order tran
scripts.

I wanted to go to a small liberal arts

experience at other types of institu

most valuable professional develop
ment experiences Ive ever had.
0 Ambrose was given the position of 
associate provost for education upon 
her return from the fellowship.
Another ACE Fellow, Samuel 
Attoh, is currently scheduled to 
spend his Fellowship semester at 
Carnegie Mellon in the spring. Attoh 
is the chair of the Department of 
Geography and Planning and a pro
fessor at the University of Toledo.
Fellows pick what ACE calls an 
Individualized Learning Project to 
research while learning about
administration as part of the applica
tion process. Docking will work on 
his project, which involves education 
in ethics, during his time here.
I am interested in ethics and 
whether human beings can identify a 
common set of shared values that 
transcend national, ethnic, gender 
and cultural boundaries ... values 
such as compassion, benevolence, 
honesty, respect, individual responsi
bility, and others, said Docking. He 
will be researching this topic in part 
by studying the CMU student body 
and the type of education that occurs 
here.
Cohon said he believes the 
University fares well in this respect.
We are an ethical institution and 
administration.... I believe students 
are exposed to ethical issues; its 
something weve worked on in the 
past, he said.
Docking will research how to tie
ethical issues into the existing cur
riculum.
Education must be more than disr 
seminating and assimilating informa
tion, he said. It should be a univer
sity experience that encourages 
reflection on the highest ethical val
ues ... and then energizes students to 
craft their life and their vocation... in 
ways that manifest these values.
This research will come together in 
a paper that will be completed by 
May 2004.
I hope that my paper will inspire 
administrators and faculty members 
to consider ways that ethics can be 
woven into the tapestry of higher 
education, said Docking.
Cohon said he would not be sur
prised if Dockings work causes 
changes at CMU.
This is a place where were always 
looking to get better in everything we 
do, he said.

because he is really focused and 
doesnt drag.
It is a difficult transition for not

Davidson taught the course in con
junction with editing a faculty publi
cation, FOCUS.
This is the first time that some
one is teaching journalism and not 
editing FOCUS, said Kaufer. We 
decoupled teaching and editing this 
year.
There are more differences 
between Davidson and OBoyle aside
from the responsibility of editing 
FOCUS. OBoyle said that he has 
looked over his predecessors course 
layout and syllabus.
Davidson took the class more in 
the direction of the mechanics and 
basics of writ
ing and the 
discourse of 
nonfiction 
writing. He 
tended more 
towards the 
practical side.
My course is 
very hands-on 
and illustra
tive, he said. I hope to teach them 
to think as well as organizational 
skills because writing is a reflection 
of clear thinking and purpose.
Most students are getting the most 
out of OBoyles teaching style.
Im not looking at my watch 
when in class, said Meghan Young,
THOMAS O'BOYLE
a senior in BHA. We are looking at 
journalism from the story perspec
tive; were trying to find the unusual 
angles, and he allows for that.
OBoyle is signed for two semes
ters. What will happen next year is 
still up in the air.
We hope hell stay, said Kaufei. 
There are no slave contracts in 
America, but just like all adjunct fac
ulty, he will have to let us know after 
the fall and spring semesters. Blit 
rest assured, we are committed to 
having staff in journalism.
There will be an evaluation of the 
course come the end of fall semester. 
OBoyle is currently in the midst 6f 
planning the spring semester jour

If youre like me, you drink 
coffee (or Mountain Dew) in the 
morning for the energy boost 
that caffeine provides. Thats 
great, until you get addicted to 
caffeine. If youre already awake, 
and just really like the taste of 
coffee or tea, you probably drink 
a decaffeinated version of such a 
beverage to avoid the whole 
addiction routine. But just how 
do they get over ninety percent 
of the caffeine out of a coffee 
bean, anyway? And where do 
they get all of the caffeine that 
they put in Mountain Dew and 
energy drinks like Red Bull?
To answer the second question 
first, some caffeine occurs natu
rally in colas, but most of the caf
feine that you encounter in highcaffeine soft drinks has been 
added. All that caffeine comes 
from decaffeinating naturallycaffeinated beverages such as 
coffee and tea.
The decaffeination process 
itself isnt all that complicated, 
but theres some interesting 
chemistry involved. There are 
actually several different 
processes that can be used, but 
the principle is basically the 
same.
Legend has it that in 1820 the 
famous German poet and heavy 
coffee-drinker Johann Wolfgang 
von Goethe asked a chemist 
friend to see if his insomnia 
could be attributed to all the cof
fee he drank. This friend, 
Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, figVanessa Shyu/Art Staff
ured it out, and is generally cred
ited with being the first person 
to successfully extract caffeine 
from coffee beans. But it wasnt 
until the turn of the century that 
commercial decaffeination was 
made feasible and decaf was 
born. Ludwig Roselius, a 
German coffee importer, hired 
researchers to develop a viable 
decaffeination method. Treating 
the beans with steam before 
decaffeination turned out to be 
the ticket, and in 1906 Roselius 
Sanka product (the name comes 
from sans caffeine) hit the 
market.
All of the various decaffeina
tion techniques involve exposing 
the beans to a solvent that will 
bind itself chemically to the caf
feine. Pre-treating the beans 
with steam makes them swell, 
increasing the surface area and 
weakening the bond between 
bean and caffeine (not unlike 
soaking dirty dishes to facilitate 
washing). The solvents used ide
ally dont take too much flavor 
away or leave too much of them
selves in the coffee. But the 
process isnt perfect, limiting us 
to chemicals that wont kill us, 
should trace amounts end up in 
our coffee. Two such chemicals 
are methylene chloride and ethyl 
acetate. The latter occurs in 
nature, so coffees and teas decaf
feinated with ethyl acetate can 
be sold as naturally decaffeinat
ed.
Another approach is to use 
carbon dioxide as the solvent. At 
roughly 70C/160F and 300 
times atmospheric pressure, it

Russian hangover 
cure comes to U.S.
A newly-released pill may be able 
to reduce hangover symptoms. Spirit 
Sciences, a Los Angeles-based firm, 
imports the pills from Russia and 
markets them as RU-21 (as in, Are 
you 21?).
RU-21 works by blocking an 
enzyme that turns one alcohol 
byproduct into acetic acid. Russian 
researchers believe that the buildup 
of acetic acid causes hangovers and 
organ damage. By preventing acetic 
acid buildup from the start, the dam
age presumably never occurs.
The drug was invented in the Cold 
War-era USSR to prevent KGB agents 
from getting drunk on top-secret spy 
missions. The pill proved ineffective 
against drunkenness, but its anti
hangover properties were discovered 
later.
Many skeptics, including Reef 
Karim, a psychiatrist and addiction 
specialist at the University of 
California at Los Angeles Medical 
Center, say that no studies other than 
Russian research confirm that RU-21 
works. Its effectiveness is hard to 
judge because the product has not 
been on the market very long.

CMU psych professor discusses Buddhism and science with Dalai Lama
by Karen Hoffmann
Science and Technology Editor
The Dalai Lama was in attendance 
at a dialogue between Western sci
entists and Tibetan Buddhists, the 
Investigating the Mind conference, 
sponsored by the Mind and Life 
Institute and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technologys McGovern 
Institute..
Marlene Behrmann, a CMU psy
chology professor who studies the 
visual system, was invited to be on 
the Mental Imagery panel.
Behrmann said she didnt know 
much about Buddhism before the. 
conference, but she learned a lot in 
preparation. I felt like an under
graduate student, she said. I 
crammed like mad.
The conference, held two week
ends ago in Boston, was originally 
scheduled for 18 months ago. 
However, at that time, the Dalai 
Lama wasnt well, so the conference 
was postponed.
The conference room was set up to 
resemble the Dalai Lamas living 
room in India. The Dalai Lama and 
the presenter of each segment of the 
conference sat in comfortable arm
chairs, surrounded by ornamental 
rugs and flowers.
Scientists and Buddhists engaged 
in four panel discussions, each last
ing two and a half hours.
Behrmann was interested in how 
the visual system can be utilized to

perform feats of visual mental 
imagery. For the most part, seeing 
with the eye and with the minds 
eye are the same, said Behrmann. 
They piggyback on the same sys
tem.
Buddhists visual imagery allows 
an individual to refine his mind and 
achieve pure awareness and very 
refined mental states  not
respond so strongly to stimuli in the 
world that are aversive, said 
Behrmann.
Behrmann wondered whether 
the principles derived by Western
science are limited by the design of 
their experiments, perhaps because 
mental imagery is not as utilized in 
Western cultures as in Tibetan 
Buddhism.
The monks were interested in 
learning how to train young monks 
better, but they were also interested 
in knowledge for knowledges sake 
 a basic scientific perspective. For 
Buddhists, the purpose of studying 
the mind is to stabilize the mind in 
order to generate mental states 
which result in the cessation of suf
fering, said Tova Tarr, a clinical 
psychologist who practices in 
Pittsburgh. Tarr also attended the 
conference.
One of the things that came to be 
understood is that for the Buddhists, 
investigating the mind is a means to 
an end. And the end is the premise 
of Buddhism, which is to reduce suf
fering in the world, said Tarr. 
There is an intention to their inves
tigation. She said the Dalai Lama 
recommended that Western scien
tists also consider the ethical aims of 
their investigations.
Galia Avidan, a graduate student 
who works with Behrmann, felt the 
scientists and the Buddhists were 
looking for answers to some of the 
same questions, like What is 'con
sciousness? What is perception? 
What does it mean to have impaired 
perception?

beams across country visible on site
by Kevin Chang
Staffwriter
A team of graduate students at CMU has devel
oped a database of over a thousand cameras that can 
be viewed by anyone on the Internet.
Working under computer science professor 
Latanya Sweeney in the Data Privacy Lab, the team 
created Camera Watch, a website that lists and links 
to a host of webcams.
[Camera Watch] is basically a database of pub
licly available cameras, said Sweeney.
The team intends to study privacy issues relating 
to the use of surveillance cameras and the availabil
ity of those cameras online.
If all these cams can be used for surveillance pur
poses, that raises privacy issues, Sweeney said.
The Camera Watch project is part of the CS 
departments larger Surveillance of Surveillances 
effort, in which researchers study how to make sure 
that people who monitor public places and access 
sensitive data do not take advantage of their power.
You have to ask what is private and what is pub
lic, said team member Brad Malin, a software engi
neering doctoral student.
According to Malin, people can be identified from 
camera pictures even when faces are blacked out.
For example, one of the questions I was looking 
at is that peoples clothing is pretty indicative of 
identity, said team member Ralph Gross, a research 
programmer at the Robotics Institute.
You could track people pretty easily using color 
... because ten people on the street will probably be 
wearing different clothes.
The Camera Watch database includes traffic cam
eras in Montgomery County, MD, cameras at CMU 
and P'tt, and at beaches around the country.
Some of the cameras listed in the database have 
already run into legal trouble for privacy issues.
According to Sweeney, there are no laws regarding 
video-only recording in public places in
Pennsylvania now, but some wiretap laws do apply 
to cameras that have microphones.
With jail cams, people had the ability to post 
comments, said Malin. Several privacy watchdog 
groups have been worried about innocent people 
being labeled criminals after being seen in jail. 
Those groups and the posting of inappropriate com
ments led to lawsuits against operators of cameras 
monitoring jail bookings; many of those cameras are 
now unavailable pending the outcome of the law
suits.
The project is currently working only in the U.S. 
because the research team felt that international law 
was too different to take into account in security and 
privacy studies.
Team members said that it was important for peo
ple to feel safe in addition to actually being safe.
Right now, people are scared of cameras because 
they dont know what the cameras are being used 
for, said Kishore Madhava, a web programmer and 
analyst at the Institute for Software Research 
International.
So, public awareness is a big thing.
To create the database, the team searched the 
Internet for lists of cameras and web pages with 
names like webcam.html or camera.html.
The version of the database online now is sort of 
the baby version, said Sweeney. The next version 
will include over six thousand cameras. We have 
sort of a central repository, said Gross.
Though the project has not officially started, the 
website has already received a lot of attention, 
receiving links to their website from newspapers and 
the popular technology web portal Slashdot.
The team noticed several trends related to the 
location of cameras and the people they monitor. 
Some interesting artifacts came out right away, 
said Sweeney.
The team was especially surprised to find that 
many cameras are in homes and other private

pm on Thursday, will include James 
McClelland, the co-director of the

Cognition and the Walter Van Dyke 
Bingham Professor of Psychology 
and Cognitive Neuroscience at CMU. 
McClellands talk will include data 
and theory about the impairment of 
the hippocampus and how this dis
ability affects learning.
I have over the years been devel
oping a theory about how learning 
works in the brain, said McClelland.
He explained that the hippocam
pus is critical for allowing people to 
learn new information and recall it 
later, but that even in the absence of 
a hippocampus, people are still capa
ble of learning. For instance, he said, 
a person could learn to read back
wards in a mirror, but would not 
ever remember having done it.
The crux of the theory is the dif
ference between implicit knowledge,
like riding a bike, and explicit knowl
edge, like recalling words one has 
read.
He said his theory helps explain 
why, when you first learn something 
in class, you can roughly grasp it, but 
not until later can you completely 
understand.
First, you memorize, but if you 
have repeated exposure, [the knowl
edge] gets gradually integrated, he 
said. But it doesnt happen instant
ly.
Besides the above renowned 
speakers, Science2003 will include a 
barbecue, networking events for 
emerging scientists, displays of new 
technologies developed by CMU and 
Pitt, and exhibits from over 50 pri
vate companies.

How coffee is decaffeinated
DECAF, from page A6
displays properties of both a liquid 
and a gas. The small carbon diox
ide molecules attract the small caf
feine molecules, but dont affect 
the larger flavor molecules.
Water is also a great solvent for 
removing the caffeine from coffee 
beans. The trouble is that it 
removes all the flavor as well (that 
is, after all, how the coffee flavor 
gets from the bean to your cup  
exposure to hot water).
Fortunately, there are several 
solutions to this problem. One of 
the most popular is to expose the 
water to methylene chloride or 
ethyl acetate after its absorbed all 
the flavors and caffeine from the 
beans. Those chemicals remove the
caffeine but leave the flavor in the 
water, to which the beans are 
exposed a second time to recover 
their flavor. This method can also 
be used with a charcoal filter.
Another solution is to expose the 
beans to coffee-flavored water, so 
there isnt any room left in the 
water for flavor molecules to make 
a chemical bond and leave the 
beans.
Only the caffeine bonds to the 
water and is removed, leaving you 
with yummy coffee without the 
side effects.
Goethe died twelve years after he 
inspired the discovery of decaf, but 
thanks to the wonders of twenti
eth-century science, you can enjoy 
caffeine-free coffee and tea for 
years to come.

BUDDHISM, from page A6
synthesis between Buddhism and 
science at the conference was, in 
Avidans opinion, that science 
wants proofs for everything. Its 
very different. You have to come 
with a different attitude to these 
issues. She gave the example of 
meditation, saying some scientists 
wont even try it if theres no proof 
that it works.
As a scientist, youre taught to be 
critical, to doubt, Avidan said.
Many of the Buddhist monks held 
doctorates, Avidan said. One had a 
PhD in molecular biology.
There was something really 
inspiring about the monks, said 
Avidan. The French monk, 
Matthieu Ricard, was very special. 
He explained complicated things in 
a simple manner, she said. He was 
very charismatic.
The Buddhists understood the 
scientists better than the scientists 
understood what the Buddhists 
were talking about  it was almost 
like trying to explain colors to a 
blind person, said Avidan.
I was surprised by the lack of 
knowledge of the brain scientists in 
how Buddhists train the mind, Tarr 
said.
The Dalai Lama spoke both 
English and Tibetan, with the aid of 
his translator, Thupten Jinpa, a phi
losophy PhD.
There were communication dif
ficulties, Behrmann said. 
Behrmann said that in the areas of 
cognitive control and attention, 
there is debate among even scienvisualize 700 deities for hours and 
hours at a time.
The outcome of the meeting was 
to lay out a research agenda. 
Monks are a model population to 
explore sophisticated and refined 
cognitive functions, said 
Behrmann.
I do think that they have ideas 
that are very interesting, very 
provocative. There are experiments 
to run with virtuoso monks.
It was really inspiring, but as a 
scientist, I remain perplexed, she 
said.
I think we achieved more than 
we could have expected. The goal 
was to take the first step in a collab
orative effort, and that goal was 
achieved.
From a scientific point of view, it 
was very special, said Avidan. The 
scientists on stage with the Dalai 
Lama  I felt really, really lucky to 
be there. It was very inspiring, the 
fact that this dialogue could actual
ly happen.
Avidan is considering attending 
the Mind and Life Institutes sum
mer program.
The Mind and Life Institute is 
about two cultures fertilizing and 
affecting each other, said Tarr. 
The Buddhists are very eager to 
receive the advancements of sci
ence. My hope is that scientists will 
open their minds to the richness of 
ways of investigating the mind and 
the whole ethics behind it.
Any change will be slow, said 
Behrmann, but there is increasing 
openmindedness, and that is the 
most reassuring of all.

tists, so the Dalai Lama couldnt 
have been expected to grasp it all.
In the mental imagery section, 
presenter Stephen Kosslyn of 
Harvard gave the Dalai Lama 
instructions in English to rotate the 
letters D and a J to form an umbrel
la.
Avidan was surprised by the 
Dalai Lamas inability to grasp such 
very trivial experimental proce
dures.
But she also recognized, and Tarr 
pointed out, that the visualizations 
that Buddhists perform are far 
superior to merely rotating letters.
I felt that the Western scientists 
failed to acknowledge the immense 
capacity of Buddhist monks to visuAny change will be

alize and rotate mental objects, 
such as the mandalas, said Tarr. 
Specifically, the Dalai Lamas 
capacity to memorize and visualize 
the details of the Kalacakra man
dala [a very intricate design].
It was humbling as a scientist to 
talk to these people, said 
Behrmann. Lab experiments are so 
contrived  we focus on a small 
corner of mental ability. Monks are 
virtuosos of mental imagery; they

The number of cameras on the 
Internet also surprised 
researchers.
When we first started, my esti
mate was that there were six thou

Sweeney. Then when we 
approached six thousand, I 
thought ten thousand. Now, we 
have six thousand hard links and

Letters to the Editor
rum
THE TARTAN
Give us now our daily free 
time, CMU administration
meetings. What if your club president sudden
ly has class this semester at 5:00 pm during 
your meeting? Scrapping the free afternoon 
means that the next available class-free time is 
not until 9:30 pm at night. If the moratorium 
on 4:30-6:30 pm classes continues to fade, 
student groups and athletic teams will 
inevitably suffer. Such organizations are vital 
to preserving a vibrant campus and need 
every chance to function well.
Besides athletics and student organizations, 
individual students depend on having the late 
afternoon free. Many students value having 
this time to meet with advisors and other staff 
who leave campus at 5:00 pm. The early 
evening, before night classes, is essential for 
many students to fit dinner into a busy sched
ule. Theoretically, a student could have class
es that stretch from morning all the way to 
9:30 pm. Such a long day is detrimental to 
students academic performance as well as 
health.
As any student who has had to wrestle with 
the HUB will tell you, student welfare is not at 
the top of the Universitys list of priorities. In 
addition to the HUBs attitude of apathetic 
sloth in dealing with everyday student busi
ness, the University has been in the habit of 
breaking its own rules.
Recently, the University developed the bad 
habit of violating its own final-exam schedul
ing policies. The policies exist to minimize 
academic stress on students and to give every
one the best opportunities possible to do well 
on finals. In response, Student Senate had to 
take action with a resolution to require the 
Universitys compliance with the policies. It 
looks like Student Senate needs to give the 
Universitys leash another yank, this time with 
a resolution to preserve our time  the most 
valuable asset in college.
A new academic year at CMU brings new 
faces, a higher price for meal blocks, and, 
unfortunately, more late-afternoon classes. 
The moratorium on 4:30-6:30 pm classes that 
existed a few short years ago is quickly tum
bling down a slippery slope created by profes
sors concerned for their personal teaching 
convenience and a University that does a woe
fully inefficient job of utilizing its limited 
classroom space.
From last spring semester to this fall, 34 
more classes start at 4:30 pm, bringing the 
total up to about 130. Students take signifi
cant advantage of the 4:30-6:30 pm timeblock to fulfill their college experience outside 
of classes. Eliminating this free time in the 
afternoon seriously damages student life at 
the University.
Athletic teams also depend on holding prac
tice between 4:30 and 6:30 pm when no mem
bers have to worry about class conflicts. For 
example, the mens swimming team starts 
practices at 4:30 pm. Waiting until 9:30 pm 
for practice, when all classes end for the day, 
is not feasible because the pool closes at 9 pm. 
Thus, some members of the team must miss 
half of practice or more.
The same is true for other athletic teams.
The football team practices during the 
afternoon, along with mens and womens soc
cer. Missing players for part or all of every 
scheduled practice seriously harms these 
team sports. Even if teams moved practice 
later, holding practice at night benefits no 
one. Who wants to run around after a ball in 
the dark?
Having afternoons free is also vital for stu
dent organizations. A quick glance at the 
schedules of the meeting rooms in the UC 
reveals that student groups need a time that 
they can count on everyones showing up for

Whoa there, Windows: 
truth will set you free
ly, and Microsoft is no different. You might 
say no one should be running a seven-yearold operating system, and while you might 
be correct, many organizations are in fact 
doing just this ... running a Windows NT 
Server, because it worked and they had no 
need to upgrade.
If I were faced with upgrade fees for NT to 
2000 to 2003, I might also consider just 
skipping 2000. Red Hat, similarly, also has 
specified end-of-support dates for their 
products.
Finally, you compare a $2,500 PC to a 
$12,300 UNIX workstation, and yet your 
entire piece is supposedly about Linux. 
While I dont particularly like the 
Unix/Linux distinction, I cant help but 
believe the comparison was based on a nonLinux platform.
In general, I believe that a one-operatingsystem world is bad. It leads to stagnation in 
development, and gives one company too 
much control.
I wont say that Linux is the answer, but I 
would prefer to see pieces that rely on hon
est facts to compare systems.
were not created in a vacuum, but the wgrld 
in which we live still exists in one, while God 
and the Truth on which everything relies 
transcends even the vacuum of our space; 
faith is our way of transcending.
No matter what you believe or dpnt 
believe, the truth is that the Bill of Rights 
does not give anybody anything; it merely 
recognizes, as the Declaration of 
Independence states, that these truths 
[are] self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by the Creator 
with certain unalienable Rights, (Creator 
... thats another name for God, Dain). 
Somewhere in the midst of the enlighten
ment pseudo-intellects like you lost sight of 
the importance of Truth regardless of its 
source; thank God our founding fathers did
nt.
Furthermore, despite your historical gym
nastics you fail to show how a religious devo
tion or believed divine association of a list of 
ten laws somehow disqualifies it as appro
priate art in a courthouse.
You are obviously a man so deeply sub
merged in a doctrine of anti-religion that 
you cant even see your own biased disdain 
for anything associated with belief ina 
Divine Being. (Thats another name for God, 
Dain).
Instead of wondering whether this 2.6, 
ton granite monument taught us anything, 
which it obviously hasnt done for you, Dain,; 
why doesnt someone as enlightened as you 
address an even greater threat tq 
church/state separation....
Why are Mr. Bill Clinton and the Reverend 
Jesse Jackson allowed to preach their poli-j 
tics in churches throughout the country, and 
why can those same churches illegally take 
up tax exempt collections during these ser
vices?
I wanted to address a few points in 
[Windows Forever, Linux Never, 
September 8] that are incorrect or mislead
ing. I wont disagree that Windows as a 
desktop operating system is far easier to 
install and manage than Linux or Unix solu
tions.
I use Windows and Office for 95 percent 
of my e-mail reading and document pro
cessing, and believe these are the best solu
tions currently available.
However, I also run a few dozen Linux 
servers. Having experience trying to run 
Windows servers in similar situations, I will 
take a Linux platform any day. In terms of 
remote maintenance, its clearly the winner. 
Some comments specifically about your 
piece:
There are certainly a large number of 
Linux distributions, but there are also a 
much smaller number of flagship distribu
tions, like Red Hat, Debian, and SuSe. I 
would guess that a majority of people that 
use niche distributions find specific reasons 
that the distributions are more suited to 
their needs. However, companies interested 
in Linux can turn to Red Hat for long-term 
support (at a price, of course).
I am curious what evidence you have that 
the University of Pittsburghs conversion 
away from Linux was influenced directly by 
the many distributions available. Again, I 
will note that if you buy a Red Hat distribu
tion, you can also elect for long-term sup
port.
This allows you to be immediately noti
fied of security patches.
You state that there is a team of develop
ers who ... monitor and patch holes in 
every Windows product, supporting that 
product for as long as its in use. Here, you 
are absolutely wrong. No vendor in the 
world can support their products indefiniteSecurity a boon to campus
are immediately informed of crimes on cam
pus and able to adjust their behaviors. The 
new first-year class was greeted with such an 
e-mail, but though crime still exists, at least 
students are made aware so that they can 
make informed choices about traversing cam
pus and surrounding areas.
Emergency blue phone lights are now wellpositioned throughout campus, after the 
installation of new phones began in December 
of 2002.
Working with former Student Body 
President Brian Namey and current Student 
Body President Dan Gilman, Doyle identified 
key locations for blue phones, such as areas of 
past crimes. By retrofitting old phones with 
blue lights and placing some in prominent 
areas, the lights are a pervasive part of cam
pus, signaling the Universitys commitment to 
safety.
Unlike last semester, a student can no 
longer walk around campus without spotting 
one of the abundant emergency devices. The 
wealth of lights, more than one could find at a 
K-Mart, has created a management problem: 
one blue light near the Alumni House, for 
example, was lit for nearly three weeks.
Other blue lights have been plagued by the 
same problem, undermining the purpose of 
lights. Crying wolf 24/7, the phones have 
become a joke rather than a beacon to draw 
help.
We applaud Doyle, and University adminis
tration, for efforts in improving campus secu
rity. CMU Campus Police also established a 
network with other local universities to ana
lyze and track crime in our community.
Through the past couple years, the campus 
community has been shocked by some 
heinous crimes. Each time, however, the 
University has listened and successfully, if 
sluggishly, reacted to student concerns.
At the dawn of another academic year, we 
ask that the University take control of the hap
hazardly flashing emergency lights before 
they adorn campus like disco lights at Studio 
54. Although fun for the eyes of inebriated 
students, the lights should only signal a plea 
for help.
. Last August, the first-year class was wel! corned to campus by a sexual assault in 
! Gesling stadium the Saturday before school 
began.
The unfortunate incident highlighted the 
pitiful shape of campus security, which lacked 
effective crime reporting, prevention, and 
presence on campus.
After the sexual assault in August of 2002 
near the epicenter of student life, a chorus of 
disapproval erupted with the incident even 
; entering some class discussions. Campus 
; Police Chief Creig Doyle ramped up patrols
 around campus, but more importantly contin_ued to keep an open ear to student dissent.
Although initially the patrols seemed to 
provide only a faade of security, Campus 
Police remarkably have become a significant 
deterrent to campus crime. Crime reports now 
sometimes end with an accomplishment  
Campus Police apprehending criminals.
Once only considered useful for unlocking 
the door of a drunkards dorm room, Campus 
Police now regularly patrol campus at night,
; on the lookout for suspicious behavior.
The University successfully responded to 
 the student body's desire to see a police presence at night around dorms and academic
 buildings.
The dearth of information surrounding the 
1 stadium sexual assault incident created out
cries from the campus community. Students 
complained that they were ill-informed of the 
severity and frequency of crimes on campus. 
The posters used by Campus Police were inef
fective in communicating to a tech-sawy stu
dent population that disregarded bulletin 
! boards like they were highway billboard 
! advertisements.
| Taking a suggestion from students, the 
; University refined the information dissemina
tion protocol to include e-mailing students 
1 about severe crimes.
Concise and vivid, the crime reports have 
been effective in alerting students to the dan
gers on campus. With many students coming 
from relatively crime-free suburbs, walking 
alone at night does not seem dangerous. 
Thanks in part to the e-mail system, students

Help Wanted: Moore no good for left
Academy Awards, people felt he was so 
brash that they tuned him out as an eccen
tric loudmouth. Despite obvious physical 
hindrances, Moore isnt content with stay
ing behind the camera. In addition to being 
the director, producer, and writer in last 
years documentary Bowling for Columbine, 
for example, Moore was the visible star.
He almost always puts his scruffy self in 
front of the camera. Although he docu
ments and works for altruistic social issues, 
one cant help but question whether his 
presence is merely intended to further his 
own celebrity power. Moores humor is per
fect for a leftist laugh, but this doesnt 
advance his opinions substantially to non
leftists. To spread his views, he needs to 
reach out to those who arent already in his 
corner. There are certainly moderates, aside 
from the polar opposites of the political 
spectrum, to whom Moore could reach out.
These nuances hardly serve as concrete 
examples to justify Moores larger success. 
Moore arguably profits most from progres
sives like me; I dragged friends and family 
with me all three times that I saw Bowling 
for Columbine in theaters.
Much of Moores criticism has of course 
come from conservatives, not moderates. 
The National Rifle Association abhorred the 
anti-gun message of Bowling for Columbine, 
dismissing the movie as a series of unpatri
otic lies that most ordinary hard-working 
Americans will never pay to see.
The NRA, in an April 2003 article, was 
most critical of Moores manipulation of 
facts and chronology. For example, a pivotal 
scene in Bowling for Columbine accused 
NRA President Charlton Heston of visiting 
the sites of school shootings right after they 
transpired to insensitively promote gun vio
lence. The time-frames Moore implied, 
however, were distorted. Moore even used 
an excerpt from a distinct North Carolina
speech to falsely summarize Hestons com
ments in Littleton, Colorado, the town 
where the Columbine High School mas* 
sacre occurred.
The aforementioned Salon review 
accused Moore of comparable dirty-work in 
Stupid White Men and his debut film, 1989s 
Roger & Me. Moore has a bad reputation for 
consistently getting his facts wrong and 
manipulating time-frames. His movies are 
vastly comprehensive works where itd be 
hard to fact-check every minute detail, but 
even a genre-breaking documentary should 
accurately document social realities.
Moores most irksome pitfall is the redun
dancy of themes, and even nigh-identical 
segments, throughout his works. The Big 
One primarily served as a documentary 
about a promotional tour for his 1997 book 
Downsize This; it even opened with a reen
actment of the Would Pat Buchanan Take a 
Check from Satan? chapter.
Moores greatest redundancy is the 
Michigan Militia, which received coverage 
as Mikes Militia in Downsize This and 
Michigan Militia in TV Nation. Moore then 
followed up with the same group in Bowling 
for Columbine. I havent read Adventures in a 
TV Nation, written by Moore and co-pro
ducer Kathleen Glynn in 1998, but its very 
purpose is to rehash the TV Nation series. 
Seeing his favorite contact from the 
Michigan Militia on the books cover indi
cates that Moore needs a bigger Rolodex. At 
least when Moore plagiarizes himself, it 
isnt illegal or unethical; its just redundant 
and shows a lack of new, original ideas.
Moore has shown some growth, though, 
and no longer reuses the same ideas as ago
nizingly as before. Stupid White Men, last 
years top-selling non-fiction book in the 
U.S., was an insightful and timely political
Michael Croland
Michael Moore released his debut film in 
1989, and now the activists progressive pol
itics have conquered media ranging from a 
best-selling book to an Oscar-winning docu
mentary film. Moores success brings wide
spread exposure to his unconventional 
views, but hes a disappointing mouthpiece 
for the leftist opinions he purports.
As a filmmaker, television producer, mag
azine editor, and author, Moore has worked 
in many media as an all-around political 
activist. His liberal slants often focus on the 
tyranny of corrupt politicians and big busi
ness. Moore excels in satire: his true talent 
is portraying the horrors of reality by comi
cally pinpointing its absurdities. Moores 
cocky I-must-obviously-be-right attitude 
penetrates most of his work. He sticks up for 
the common man so well because he is the 
common man. Many people dont want to 
listen to him, because they think he doesnt 
know what he's talking about.
I had no college education and flunked 
twelfth-grade English, conceded Moore in 
his 1997 film The Big One. He might be an 
admirable self-made man, but he is not 
much of an intellectual. Criticisms like One 
Moore stupid white man, the title of a 2002 
Salon article reviewing Moores book Stupid 
White Men, seem inevitable.
The key to furthering against-the-grain 
political views is to appeal to new audi
ences, but many superficial factors keep 
Moore from making such strides. Hes over
weight, homely, and unkempt. He almost 
never dresses decently, as seen in his trade
mark sloppy attire and baseball cap. Even 
when he donned a tuxedo at this years

Social Security:
\ Time to Privatize
Ben Hackett
Even though polls commissioned by the Cato 
Institute show that over two-thirds of Americans 
support privatizing Social Security,  the issue is 
rarely brought up. It goes without saying that the 
majority of the left is against privatization, even 
though most Washington politicians are investors 
themselves. They would be against anything that 
seemed to remove any part of power from their 
hands. What better election platform than one that 
says, We brought you these social programs, we 
administrate them, and we make sure that there 
are funds for you when you are ready to retire?
We have scare tactics being used against a most
ly uninformed constituency, specifically the elderly 
end of the spectrum, to secure votes and preserve 
the status quo. A recent Cato Institute policy analy
sis shows irrefutably why Social Security, 
Medicare, and the like are in need of dire reform 
and/or privatization. The analysis, written by 
Chris Edwards and Tad DeHaven, highlights a 
problem that in the future may cause either the 
collapse of the American economy under the 
weight of its social programs, or a generational 
resentment towards the elderly.
The study indicates that by 2040 the number of 
elderly will have risen by 116 percent, while the 
number of new workers will have only risen by 22 
percent. This data indicates that these new work
ers will have to bear a heavier load than any group 
prior. Even today, the federal government spends 
35 percent  already too much  of its 2.2 trillion 
dollar budget on programs for the elderly. This is a 
case of vote-pandering politicians making promis
es with the pens and money from your checkbooks.
In Edwards study, the country is looking at 
Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and other 
programs for the elderly making up 27.4 percent of 
the Gross Domestic Product  todays figure is 20 
percent. This outlay is devastating to an economy 
of growth. It is not simply a matter of more spend
ing on these programs; it also concerns the loss of 
money for use in other, more efficient investments.
. Think of what the workers, the ones paying the 
'taxes to support these programs, will say when the 
weight of these entitlement programs begins to 
force funds out of other programs such as unem
ployment compensation. There is a basic demo
graphic problem here as the baby boomers begin to 
retire. Coupled with the longer life expectancy and 
an overall higher standard of living now for the 
elderly, a fiscal crisis develops. While longer life 
expectancy and an increase in the standards of liv
ing are wonderful things, the burden placed on the 
youth of today and tomorrow will become unbear
able without substantial reform. And from an eco
nomics and taxes perspective, the burden is 
increasingly unfair.
For example, a National Bureau of Economic 
Research Working paper shows that todays 25- 
year-old will pay over 500 thousand dollars in 
taxes, while receiving only 200 thousand dollars in 
benefits. This is a net loss of over 300 thousand 
dollars. To compare, todays 65-year-olds have paid 
less than 200 thousand dollars, and will receive 
around 250 thousand dollars in benefits from the 
government.
Examine, then, new legislation such as the pre
scription drug benefits plan. This plan would sim
ply add on to the burden currently placed on the 
; working youth by Social Security, Medicare, and 
Medicaid. Thus, the plan is effective political pos
turing in an election year, but economically 
unsound.
Popularly supported, but demonized by politi
cians, especially on the left, privatization of Social 
Security and the establishment of Medicare and 
Medicaid savings accounts would do wonders for 
the future of this countrys workers and economy. 
People are more experienced with personal fund 
management than ever before, as over half of fam
ilies own stocks or are involved in mutual funds. 
The payroll taxes could be put into private savings 
accounts. Thus, instead of the government borrow
ing the money from its citizens, the citizens would 
be earning interest and controlling their own earn
ings. Even at the most modest growth rates, the 
average citizen could do much better in financing 
the Social Security burdens than the federal gov. ernment. As is typically the case, less governmen
tal involvement and more personal responsibility 
leads to progress and a brighter future.

/ Andrew Johnson
Moore's Law: Preaching falsities to the choir
Lawmakers and judges often flail away at 
problems when the solution lies deeper than 
they either comprehend or care to acknowl
edge. Take, for example, the recent landmark 
Supreme Court case Gratz v. Bollinger, essen
tially a reaffirmation of affirmative action 
and diversity measures in higher education. 
Yet these measures can only be justified  if 
they can be justified at all  in a society 
where blacks and Hispanics face unequal 
conditions and garner unequal resources in 
primary education. Similarly, politicians 
struggle to deal with rising prison popula
tions due to laws that lock up dope smokers at 
astronomical rates, while fatal drunk driving 
episodes, alcohol-related spousal abuse, and 
just the general opinion of U.S. society ought 
to make marijuana legal in the first place, 
based on relative potential harm compared to 
alcohol.
Consider, then, another weed at which pol
icy-makers hack away while ignoring the 
roots of the problem. An acquaintance of 
mine, soon after the Republicans romped the 
Democrats in the last congressional elections, 
adopted into his instant messenger profile the 
phrase Canada is looking better every day, 
and I must agree with that sentiment as 
Canadian lawmakers continue to struggle for 
what is right. Just last Thursday, Canadian 
parliament killed another bill aimed at defin
ing marriage as the union of a man and a 
woman, and we all know in which country 
marijuana decriminalization will happen 
first.
In another Supreme Court case this sum
mer, Lawrence v. Texas, the justices struck 
down anti-sodomy statutes, affirming that 
relative morality does not rule our country 
completely, at least until money is involved. 
We at Carnegie Mellon are lucky to be 
enmeshed in a community that provides 
same-sex partner benefits to its employees, 
while just down the street the University of 
Pittsburgh wont get with the times. This is a 
common trend  the state institution wont 
provide the same benefits to gays the private 
sector already does. Why cant the rest of the 
U.S., like Vermont, offer gays the same bene
fits for marriage?
Its the taxes, stupid. Beyond the qualms of 
the conservative religious war-mongering
propagandists who somehow snuck into 
power, the states and the federal government 
just do not want to dole out the tax breaks to 
these same-sex couples. And though it 
becomes increasingly unwise for politicians 
to preach anti-homosexual rhetoric, George 
W. Bush can still urge Congress to define a 
marriage as the union of a man and a woman. 
But then again, thats just the visible issue 
that politicians choose to debate.
Underneath it all is the sanctity of mar
riage. Gays fight for the right to the institu
tion, for the tax money, and for the recogni
tion that their lifestyle is as moral as the rest 
of ours.
They should have the right to this union, if 
anyone should, but that's debatable.
Marriage is no longer a sacred affair. 
Catholics ought to be daunted by U.S. Census 
Bureau statistics that show about half of all 
couples will be divorced within 15 years of 
wedlock. Thats a scary proposition when failAnnalisa Schaefer/Copy Staff
ure to make it work could land you in hell for 
all eternity, or at least with another sin on 
your soul. Perhaps the Vatican should recant 
its stance against same-sex marriage and let 
homosexuals get in the handbasket. Why 
should the state, with tax breaks, sponsor an 
institution that has failed? Instead, the state 
should concentrate on making sure unions 
that foster children are reinforced, whether 
the children be the product of raunchy het
erosexual sex or adoption by responsible 
homosexual partners. The U.S will get 
nowhere by remaining trapped in backwards 
customs, and meanwhile our northern neigh
bors march forward, though even they 
restrict themselves to a poor framework of 
progress.

commentary that moved beyond a series of 
short endeavors to elicit laughter, just like 
Downsize This. Moores new book, Dude, 
Wheres My Country?, comes out next month, 
and will hopefully continue where Stupid 
White Men left off. Moores films generally 
provide instant gratification by documenting 
actual success. The Big One showed how 
Moore was able to persuade Nike CEO Philip
Knight to donate charitable funds to Moores 
unemployment-scarred hometown of Flint, 
Michigan. In tackling the overwhelming topic 
of gun violence in Bowling for Columbine, 
Moore recruited actual Columbine survivors 
to convince K-Mart to stop selling bullets. This 
kind of activism is inspirational to the 
already-converted masses, and why Moore is 
so beloved by his supporters.
Michael Moore is an impressive filmmaker 
and author whose political views are comfort
ing and hilarious to those already in agree
ment, but for those with alternative political 
ideologies, little will change from exposure to 
Moores redundant and distortive hijinks.
Michael Croland (mic@) is a junior creative 
and professional writing double-major, with a 
minor in religious studies. Although disap
pointed to learn The Awful Truth, he still cant 
wait to see Moores new film, Fahrenheit 9/11, 
next year.

CMU Tartans kennel Terriers in 59-6 blowout
Shafeeq Sinnamohideen/Junior Staff
Adam Bowland, junior defensive back (#13), helped to complete in a near shutout of Hiram.
Thistledown
Whos next: Carnegie Mellon (3-0) v. 
Johns Hopkins University (3-0) 1 pm, 
Saturday, September 28 on WRCT, 88.3 
FM.
Last meeting: In Baltimore last year, 
the Tartans were pushed around like 
chess pieces by a stronger Johns Hopkins 
team in a 28-7 defeat. The Tartans also 
pushed around each other. After a fum
bled snap, senior quarterback Robb 
Finkey and offensive coordinator Rich 
Erdelyi enganged in a brief shouting and 
shoving match that led to Jarrod 
Highbergers first action as CMU QB. 
Highberger played well, but committed 
four turnovers. The Tartan defense was 
no match for the JHU ground game, 
allowing 236 yards.
The skinny: Johns Hopkins, ranked 
32nd according to d3football.com, 
cruised to a 24-0 win over Randolph 
Macon Saturday. Running back Adam 
Cook had 133 all-purpose yards in the 
win. CMU opponents have had success 
running the football against the 3-3-5 (or
3-5-3) nickel from a spread formation.
Look for: Tom Pfister. The CMU line
backer seems to be everywhere on the 
field. He returned an interception 60 
yards for a touchdown Saturday.
Result: The Tartans have dieted on 
cupcakes for the first three weeks of this 
season. This is the first real test of the sea
son for CMU. Victories have not been won 
as much as they have been handed to 
them. If CMU cannot stop the run, it will 
be a long afternoon for the Tartans. Johns 
Hopkins 17, Carnegie Mellon 7.
Team Notes: Senior linebacker Roman 
Feola and running back Joe Hurley were 
out with a hamstring injury and twisted 
ankle, respectively. Both should be avail
able against JHU. Wide receiver Kevin 
Manley is doubtful for the game. He was 
in street clothes and on crutches Saturday 
with a knee injury. With Saturdays game 
well in hand, just about every man on the 
Tartan roster played. Defensive linemen 
Judson Kroh and Marvin Ward recorded 
the only sacks against Hiram.

The Tartan gridiron squad was able to 
improve its record to 3-0 last Saturday when 
it faced the Hiram Terriers at Gesling 
Stadium. CMU had the game wrapped up 
from the beginning, as they went on to win 
big by a score of 59-6.
To say that the Hiram Terriers lacked com
petitiveness might be an understatement. 
CMU was able to do whatever they wanted to 
on offense all day, totaling 45 points in the 
first half alone.
Hiram is a very young football team, said 
head coach Rich Lackner. Coach Myers is 
trying to rebuild the program there, and that 
takes time.
The Tartans struck first blood two minutes 
into the game. A 54-yard reception from 
junior quarterback Jarrod Highberger to 
junior halfback Ryan Neupaver would set up 
a one-yard run by junior fullback Brad 
Stanley.
Hiram wasnt really prepared for the 
offensive scheme that we showed them, 
said Neupaver.
Not much later, a Hiram fumble recovered 
by first-year Aaron Lewis put CMU in posi
tion to score again. This time, sophomore 
halfback Jon Cakert crossed the goal line 
from 5 yards out to put CMU ahead 14-0.
On Hirams next drive, it turned the ball 
over on downs. Two plays into the following 
CMU drive, Highberger connected for a 
touchdown to his main receiver, senior Chris 
Kay, on a 58-yard bomb.
In the films this week we saw we could go 
deep on them, said Kay. It was a play action 
pass. I faked a block, then turned it on, and 
got a great ball from Jarrod.
Kay put forth a nice extra effort to shed a 
couple tackles for the score.
That concludes all the action the offense 
would see in the first quarter, but it picked 
up right where it left off in the second. 
Things started with a seven-yard Brad 
Stanley touchdown run at 13:51.
Perhaps the most impressive drive of the 
day came after a Tartan muffed punt return, 
where CMU found themselves starting on 
their own 1-yard line. They eventually would 
go 99 yards, finishing to the tune of a 24- 
yard left sideline jaunt by Neupaver. The 
score was now 35-0.
The CMU defense was determined not to 
end the game without a scoring contribu
tion.
On the next play from the line of scrim
mage, sophomore defensive back Thomas 
Pfister intercepted a Tom Roszell pass and
returned it the distance to put the Tartans up 
42-0.
I saw Roszell looking at my receiver, said 
Pfister. I waited for the throw, made a break 
on it, tucked it in and ran. I got caught from 
behind at Bethany after an interception, and 
I never would have lived it down if that hap
pened again.
Before the half ended, the Tartans were 
able to convert for another score. It came 
from a 22-yard field goal by first-year Neil 
Stegall. At this point, the game was only half 
finished and CMU had a 45-point lead.
We came out ready to do our best and 
overall we performed well, said senior 
defensive tackle Patrick Marcotte. We 
appreciate the points the offense has been 
putting up recently, but there are still places 
where we all need to improve.
Because of the disparity in the score, the 
second half was largely uneventful. Though 
Tartans were able to get two more touch
downs, they also allowed the Terriers their 
score, losing the shutout.
Just the win wasn't enough for us this 
week, said Pfister. We were going for a 
shutout. We knew we had to develop some 
killer instinct, or else Johns Hopkins will tear 
us apart.
Tartan first-year halfback Kevin Haney 
struck with the first score of the second half 
on his 32-yard rush. The last CMU touch
down came on a 7-yard rush by first-year 
halfback Michael Ginestra in the fourth 
quarter.
Hirams only touchdown came with 4:10 
remaining in the third quarter. Roszell found 
Darrin Brounce in the end zone for a 15-yard 
reception. After all was said and done, CMU 
was on top 59-6.
Its difficult to identify standout players in 
the game because the Tartans were able to 
rotate nearly everyone into the game. A lot of 
young faces got to see playing time, one of 
the few positives about playing an unskilled 
team.
Even when the second and third teams 
got in the game they played the way they 
should against a team like Hiram, said Kay.
Next weeks challenge is going to be a bit 
different for the Tartans. Johns Hopkins 
University comes to Pittsburgh, and with 
them a higher level of play.
The caliber is going to be quite a bit high
er next Saturday, said junior defensive back 
Adam Lovrovich. We all want to win this 
next one pretty bad.
The Tartans have a good sense of the need 
to avoid complacency this week as they work 
on preparing for Johns Hopkins. Only time 
will tell, as they hit the field once again at 
Gesling Stadium this Saturday at 1 pm.
Soccer team kills Hiram
by Andrew Johnson
Editor-in-Chief
The womens soccer team gave the 
Hiram Terriers their annual paddling 
in Gesling last Tuesday, after a score 
of five to nothing put the Tartans at a 
record of four wins and a draw. The 
Tartan goalkeepers might have rather 
spent the day at home and the 
Tartans would have faired about as 
well without them, as Hiram 
launched just one shot on goal; by 
contrast, the Tartans managed to fire 
20 shots at the Terriers goal.
Sophomore midfielder/forward 
Julie Richter led the team with two 
goals and an assist. She scored first in 
the 23rd minute of play and again in 
the 52nd minute.
A minute after Richters second 
goal, senior midfielder Merry 
McConnochie blasted in the fifth 
score with an assist by Richter. 
Sophomore midfielder/forward 
Nadya Yaghoubi scored the second 
goal of the game unassisted. 
Sophomore midfielder/forward 
Kristin Bevilacqua-Linn tallied the 
third point with an assist from sopho
more backfielder Margaret Beck.
A nearly breathless Terrier team 
shook hands with the Tartans at the 
end of the game, and it seemed the 
home team had hardly broken a 
sweat. Almost the entire game, as evi
denced by the disparity in shots on
goals between the teams, was spent 
in the Terrier end as the CMU squad 
relentlessly fired shots with their 
heads and feet at the Hiram net. The 
Terriers could hardly inbound a ball 
to their own players, and when they 
managed to, the ball was swiftly 
taken back by the Carnegie Mellon 
team. By the second half, the Terriers 
tongues lolled out of their mouths, 
the players lacking even the hustle to 
fetch a loose ball.
One thing thats hard in a game 
like this is to not get too lackadaisi
cal, said team co-captain 
McConnochie. We had to come out 
playing hard to make a statement. 
McConnochie has a bright outlook 
on the season.
Were confident. Its just a matter 
of if we can come out [strong] for 
each game, she said.
Bevilacqua-Linn said the team 
needs to increase its intensity before 
conference games in October, where 
they will be tested by nationally 
ranked teams like Washington 
University and the University of 
Chicago, but she said the teams syn
ergy continues to grow.
We have to finish our chances bet
ter and then well be good, she said. 
Every time we play together, we get 
to know each other a little better.
I am pleased with the way the 
team is coming together, stated head 
coach Heather Kendra via e-mail. 
Our play is improving every day.

The mens and womens tennis team began 
their season last Saturday with an outstanding 
win of five sets to two and eight sets to one respec
tively over the Spartans of Case Western Reserve 
University (CWRU). This match marked the 
Tartans first dual-match of the season and the 
mens retaliation of last springs loss to the 
Spartans in the UAA tournament.
The Tartans have thus far participated in a few 
weekend round-robin matches where they have 
done pretty well, according to coach Andrew 
Girard.
Junior history major Steve Ehrlich and junior 
ECE student Boris Sofman began the dash for vic
tory as they defeated Steve Hsu and Ben Sinder of 
CWRU in #1 doubles 8-6.
Second doubles consisting of sophomore ECE 
student Carl Yang and Jordan Koslosky swept Eric 
Ranke and Jon Waldman eight sets to three. 
Bringing up the anchor was the duo of sophomore 
Paul Buyanovsky and first-year Rex CarazoZapetis, completing the doubles wins with a score 
of 9-7.
The mens singles were able to crush CWRU 
four sets to two. Ehrlich displayed an excellent 
show of talent over Steve Hsu of CWRU in the first 
singles, with a 6-4, 6-1 win.
Other singles contributing winners were #4 
senior Jason Zucker, #5 Yang, and #6 Koslosky,

The mens and womens doubles teams swept six straight matches in their season opener against Case 
Western Reserve University.
Tennis men, women dominate
with victories of 6-4, 6-3; 6-2, 6-1; and 6-0,5-7, 
6-2 respectively.
Sofman lost his second singles match to Sinder 
despite claiming the first set via tie-breaker. 
Sofman fell 6-7(4), 6-2, 6-4. Buyanovsky also 
had trouble with CWRUs Radke who defeated 
him 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.
The womens team opened their season with an 
impressive 8-1 victory over the Spartans. The 
women, like the men, were able to take all three 
double matches. Leading the pack with the #1 
doubles were first-year Mona Iyer and junior 
Christiana Weng, who defeated CWRUs Steph 
Tande and Steph Polites eight games to two. The 
#2 doubles victory was led by sophomore Ali Liu 
and sophomore Grace Hwang eight games to two, 
and the #3 singles junior Ann Kozlowski and Mai 
Otsuka won 8-5.
The singles performed just as well, only giving 
up one match, resulting in a 5-1 win. Second sin
gles Iyer won over Tande 6-2, 6-1. Third singles 
Liu won 6-1, 6-2, #4 singles Hwang defeated 
Cindy Hsieh 6-1,6-2, #5 singles Kozlowski swept 
Sarah Langhorst six to zero both games, and #6 
singles Kavita Shah defeated Christiana Yun 6-0, 
6-2.
Both the mens and womens teams have a lot 
of depth this year, said Girard, also noting that 
even the first-years are putting up impressive per
formances.
The Tartans will face the Alligators next at 
Allegheny College in another dual match on 
Tuesday at 4 pm.
Future a bit hazy 
for football seer
Take note: I hate writing a football column 
that comes out on Monday. I cannot write it 
on Sunday and talk about the day's events; the 
strain of editing it that same day for publica
tion is too much. I have to write it mid-week 
and talk about what I think will happen on 
Sunday, but my predictions are not useful and 
they dont give readers anything to look for 
because the game has already happened. 
Needless to say, I cannot predict the future, as 
was evident from last week's prognostication 
debacle that saw my mighty mountain fail to 
make 2 field goals and an extra point against 
the offensively inept Carolina Panthers. Not 
that I hide it well, but Im sick of the NFL sea
son making me look the fool these first two 
weeks. Yes, like any football dramat I enjoy 
seeing the early surprise success stories such 
as the Bills and the Panthers.
Yes, I love watching Kurt Warner get hurt, 
Jeremy Shockey let a touchdown hit him in 
the hands and bounce off, and Ill be damned 
if I didnt enjoy watching Jamal Lewis break 
the single game rushing record while racking 
up points for my fantasy team. But if just once 
the teams who are supposed to be good would 
be good, thatd be great. Not to beat a dead 
horse, but what the hell, John Gruden? You 
were supposed to be an offensive guru, and 
the Bucs cant kick a damn field goal? Not to 
mention the champs impeccable timing; I 
raved about them for a few thousand charac
ters in the last column, only to look stupid 
Monday afternoon as thousands of greedy 
Tartan readers clawed their way to the nearest 
newspaper distribution shelf and tore through 
to the sports section to marvel at my work. 
Thanks, Tampa Bay, that was cool of you.
But enough of them; how bout them 
Eagles? Their faltering is actually a satisfying 
event for me. I loathe Philly fans. No one is 
more annoying, pretentious, or flat-out disillu
sioned than the resident crazies in Philly. 
Memo to Eagles aficionados: your team sucks, 
deal with it. McNabb is missing his receivers 
this year, and his scrambling ability seems to 
be gone or forgotten; maybe hell find it over 
the bye-week. The only negative to all of this 
is that I ruefully proclaimed him to still be 
great, and this team to be a contender.
Reality: 2, Colin: 0. Fantastic.
Switching divisions, a minor victory 
occurred in the AFC when the Dolphins finally 
got rolling, or at least they may have. A win 
over the hapless Jets proved they can run the 
ball and it does lead to victories. However, did 
they look like a Super Bowl team? No. Im 
down 3. The Steelers, yeah, they did me good. 
One week after I figured them to be a domi
nant team in the AFC, the Chiefs give it to 
them in KC. Maddox shows his inconsistency 
and goes from offensive player of the week in 
the first week to offensive goat of the week 
against the Chiefs. Colin falls behind to what 
really happened by 4.
Finally, I figured I was safe with Monday 
nights match-up featuring the Tunas still-notgood-Cowboys vs. the New York Giants, who 
had shut down the Rams in week one. Well, 
once again, the joke was on me. Dallas won an 
emotional OT battle and proved that in some 
cases a good coach can spark a poor team. 
Good for them, bad for me, Im down 5. Of 
course by the time you read this, all that will 
have happened two Sundays ago will be 
replaced by week 3 action. Ah well, c'est la vie, 
as they say.
Okay, enough of the past. Time to focus on 
the future: week 3. After the touch of grey was 
revealed in the Bucs silver lining, they look to 
find some offense this week against another 
strong division rival, Atlanta, who lost a heartbreaker to Washington last week.
I still think the Bucs are the best defensive 
team in the NFL, even though Carolina has 
flexed its muscle the last two weeks. Atlanta is 
not the same team offensively without Vick, 
but they are no slouch. Peerless Price has yet 
to pay off, but Doug Johnson is starting to find 
a groove, and soon enough I expect big things 
from this team - but not this week. Tampa Bay 
should hand th Falcons another loss. 
However, if my prognostication status quo is 
maintained, by the time you read this, the 
Tampa bandwagon I leapt on after week one 
will have lost another wheel, leaving my repu
tation to cling to a broken axle as its dragged 
through the mud. But so it goes.
The games of the week this week are found 
in the AFC, and both are at night. First, on 
Sunday night the surprise Bills square off 
against the should-be-better Dolphins in 
Miami. This game should be an offensive 
showdown as Drew Bledsoe leads an efficient 
Buffalo passing game against Rickys dominat
ing running attack. This is a chance for both 
teams to make a statement: Buffalo wants to 
prove their 2-0 start isnt a fluke while the Fins 
need to show the league they are a legitimate 
Super Bowl contender after faltering against 
Houston. Because Im still on the Florida 
bandwagon, I pick Miami.
The Monday night game is a great one, too: 
an intense AFC West rivalry in Denver. Rich 
Gannon is showing some age this season as he 
leads the Raiders into the Mile-High City. 
While Jake Plummer may not be the best 
option for the Broncos, they dont need a good 
QB: just give the ball to Portis and watch him 
run. The Raiders barely escaped the Bengals 
last week, but can still play and are a threat. 
However, I think the Broncos will win if Portis 
makes it through the entire game.
Hopefully this weeks statements will not 
bite me in the butt like they did last week, but 
either way, enjoy the games (which you 
already should have done by the time you 
read this).

Baby, you can ride my bike
AB Greenbike offers freewheeling fun and practical transporation
Alex Meseguer/News Editor
Chris Smoak and Matt Toups with the green bikes now available free at the UC Info Desk.
Beginning Tuesday, students without wheels of 
their own can take advantage of AB Green Bike, a 
new project of the Activities Board (AB). 
Students, faculty, and staff can go to the UC Info 
Desk to sign up free of charge. After filling out a 
form and showing their CMU IDs, they will imme
diately be eligible to go to the UC turn-around, 
unlock one of 10 green bikes, and use it for up to 
48 hours.
Matt Toups, a senior in computer science and 
history, has wanted to start up a program like AB 
Green Bike since learning about a similar pro
gram at the University of Michigan two years ago. 
Last spring, Toups and current Activities Board 
Chair Chris Smoak, a senior computer science and 
cognitive science double-major, felt the timing 
was perfect. With leftover funding from the 
Activities Board, sunny weather, public transit 
woes, and access to bikes, the idea came together.
There was this access to dirt-cheap, unwanted 
bikes, explained Toups.
The bicycles were purchased inexpensively 
from Free Ride, an organization in Wilkinsburg 
that facilitates a large-scale bike-recycling pro
gram. Since many students lack cars and find the 
bus system inadequate, Smoak said, the program 
will be a big hit.
The eventual idea, said Smoak, is that well 
have lights on the bikes, and baskets, so people
can go to [Giant Eagle] at night and get gro
ceries.
If the program has initial success, another 
twenty bikes will also be added.
The program also teaches students about main
taining and repairing bikes. The Activities Board 
will sponsor a bike workshop on Friday at 3 pm on 
The Cut, near the flagpole. The event will feature 
a one-hour tutorial on fixing bikes, followed by 
another hour of question-and-answer and 
instruction by request. The workshop, Green 
Bikes fourth on campus this semester, will be 
conducted by representatives from Free Ride.
Following the two-hour workshop, cyclists can 
tour Pittsburgh during the monthly, city-wide 
Critical Mass. Students can meet the group near 
the flagpole at 5 pm and then join an estimated 
100 people cycling on city streets. Toups called 
Critical Mass a celebration of the Pittsburgh doit-yourself bike community, adding that there 
was a contingent of Green Bikes from Carnegie 
Mellon in last months event. AB Green Bike, said 
Toups, provides a healthy, fun, and safe alterna
tive to other forms of transportation for the cam
pus community. These ten new bikes may also 
prove to be the perfect vehicle for students to con
veniently explore the off-campus offerings of 
Pittsburgh.

Over the summer, more rooms were added to Morewood 
Gardens, so that its occupancy totaled 429 female students. 
As regular as rain and wind each spring and fall is the assort
ed array of feminine legs, arms, and torsos hanging from the 
windows of Morewood Gardens, read the Tartan article from 
the date. Yes, Morewood is literally bulging at the seams, with 
a capacity crowd filling the luxurious, palatial mansion.

The Tartan ran a poll about underclassmen drinking and smok
ing, asking whether being at college had affected their smoking 
and drinking habits. Among the published responses were: 
Yes, beer is nutritious. I drink it after I run, Yes! Wouldn't 
you if more beer than water poured out of the frats?, and No, 
I dont smoke or drink. Im a pretty boring person as a whole.

Outraged students protested limited hours at Hunt Library by 
staging sit-ins and going before the Student Senate. The Senate 
met with University Librarian Charles Lowry to discuss the 
change, but after the negotiations, the prevailing feeling among 
students was one of being ignored and underrepresented.

Companies used aggressive recruiting tactics at the Technical 
Opportunities Conference to access a broader spectrum of stu

focused on narrow segments of the population.

Design for living
John Maedas Wats:0n? Festival lecture packed a visual punch
Courtesy of Eric Sloss
John Maeda, head of MIT multimedia
On any given day, design and art are 
somehow equal, said John Maeda, 
after typing in art and then design 
into the search engine Google, as part 
of his lecture this past Wednesday in the 
Purnell Center.
The audience of Carnegie Mellon fac
ulty, students, and associates may not 
have been expecting a renowned com
puter scientist and head of the MIT 
Media Labs Physical Language 
Workshop to be giving a lecture using 
Google, where sugar packet contents 
became stimulating media art, or where 
the letters of the alphabet blew up like 
balloons on the screen, but that is just 
what Maeda had in mind  to make his 
audience see computers in an entirely 
new light.
John Maedas surprising lecture was 
just the beginning of Wats:on?, the 
sixth annual Jill Watson Festival Across 
the Arts. Maedas use of Google to com
pare the two disciplines may have 
seemed out of the ordinary, but the bal
ance between art and design that 
resulted from Maedas inquiry was no 
coincidence.
The two-day festival is a tribute to the 
late Jill Watson, an alumna of Carnegie 
Mellon University and accomplished 
architect whose interests spanned a 
variety of artistic disciplines. The cele
bration of interdisciplinary activities 
included workshops, performances, 
and lectures by both recognized and 
emerging artists from Europe and
North America.
Dan Boyarski, who heads the design 
program at Carnegie Mellon and who 
was part of the committee that chose 
this years presenters, called Maedas 
work exemplary.
[John] has [kept] one foot in the 
design field and one foot in the comput
er field ... and he has done so with great 
grace, Boyarski said as he introduced 
Maeda to a packed auditorium.
After earning his undergraduate and 
graduate degrees at MIT, he received a 
PhD from Tsukuba University of Art and 
Design in Japan. He then went on to 
become the associate director of the 
MIT Media Laboratory, Sony Career 
Development Professor of Media Arts 
and Sciences, associate professor of 
Design and Computation, and the 
director .of the Physical Language 
Workshop.
He is also the author of two books, 
Design by Numbers (which he wrote to 
simplify coding vocabulary) and 
Maeda@Media, and he created a series 
of Reactive Books, currently out of 
print, whose short texts are accompa
nied by software on topics such as 
sound and time.
Besides the family that he called his 
most rewarding honor  the honor of 
being husband to his wife and father to 
four daughters  Maeda has received a 
multitude of awards for his work. 
Among the most prestigious are the 
Mainishi Design Prize, Japans highest 
honor in the field of design, and the 
National Design Award, the U.S.s 
equivalent honor.
He has also displayed his multimedia 
artwork all over the world. His most 
recent show at Cristinerose Gallery, in 
January of 2003, was titled Food. The 
exhibit involved the scanning of foods 
like Cheetos or pretzel sticks that 
Maeda transformed with his computa
tional skills into a type of Cheeto paint 
brush. He then created a virtually edi
ble butterfly made from the familiar 
bright orange cheese. This type of inge
nuity  mixing tactile reality with digi
tal design  has earned Maeda respect
in both fields, and makes him a great 
teacher.
My father always told me teaching 
was a giving profession, he said.
And in todays troubled times, teach
ers should strive to give students as 
many tools and resources as possible, 
said Maeda.
One of the premises of my new proj
ect [The Creative Digital Economy] is to 
show that creativity has a direct eco
nomic value. Im trying to make artists 
who can make a living, he said. I want 
the computer to support people who 
want to live a creative life.
Work ethic helps, he said, but dont 
overdo it.
You have to be intense, but you have 
to be able to let go, said Maeda. 
Happiness is everything to me.
Maedas visually stimulating lecture 
spanned a lifetime of his questions 
about computers, design, and the 
future of the artist. But before Maeda 
presented his past and current experi
ments, he told his personal story, from 
the very beginning. Maeda grew up in 
a tofu world, he said, doing hard 
physical labor from 6 pm to 2 am for his 
familys tofu manufacturing store in 
Seattles Chinatown. Between work and 
school, he had little time for other 
things, and when his father bought him 
a computer, he had no idea what to do 
with it, he said.
For a long time, said Maeda, the com
puter was a black screen that did noth
ing unless he typed in code. Through 
the years, Maedas interaction with his 
own computer evolved as the computer 
itself evolved from a box that did noth
ing, to more graphical, and eventual
ly to what most people assume the com
puter has always been, a tool, he said. 
However, Maeda encouraged his audi
ence to seek a more fluid relationship 
with the machine and to view it as a 
material.
[Maeda] picks people who are good 
visually as well as good computational
ly to work with him in his workshop at 
MIT, said Boyarski. Basically, they
explore these amazing digital artifacts, 
the sheer beauty of them, the amaze
ment. I think he teaches people how to 
talk to the computer directly because 
software is limiting.
Maeda held a workshop the following 
day, where many eager students of the 
arts hurried to sign up and learn his 
secret programs. However, much like 
his lecture, the content proved to be 
unexpected. When asked what he 
thought of the workshop, Vincent Lai, a 
sophomore in industrial design, said: I 
thought we were going to do program
ming of some sort or even use one of his 
programs he created. Instead, it was lit
tle computer interaction. We did fun 
exercises and played games. I guess he 
was trying to convey to us to use less of 
the computer.
Carin Rogoff, a sophomore design 
major, felt liberated by the experience.
We played a lot of games, and my 
computer wasnt working, but then I 
realized it didnt even matter because I 
didnt need it, she said.
I wanted the students to feel that 
even though life is moving around 
them, sometimes parts come together, 
and if you dont keep watch, youll miss 
them, said Maeda. You have to make 
something different, it has to be diffi
cult to create, and it has to be deep.
We say to our design students, 
Anything you design is going to impact 
peoples lives; be aware of that. Youre 
going to affect someone.  Boyarski 
agreed.
Teaching computer science can be 
strenuous due to the speed at whch the 
programs and software change, but stu
dents are changing with them, he said.
Students are the smartest people at a 
university, he said. Every day, I see 
students doing something that I can 
never do. You have two options: you can 
give up, or you can labor at night to 
catch up to them. That is what I do  
labor at night.

Incredible but true
Fight club author Chuck Palahniuks radical research makes for an explosive lecture
According to The Pitt News, Victims 26 through 29 were reported here in 
Pittsburgh last Tuesday. Two nights before, New York EMS had whisked number 25 
to a nearby hospital. The epidemic has already hit several major cities and universi
ties around the United States, and is only getting started  on average, said Chuck 
Palahniuk at his September 16 lecture in Oakland, two people in every audience 
faint when they hear his new short story, Guts.
The story, which describes in graphic detail the consequences of adolescent sexu
al experimentation using pool maintenance equipment, wont be published until it 
appears in the February issue of Playboy. But in choosing between cannibalism and 
a watery death, the storys protagonist has already turned stomachs nationwide.
Palahniuk, bestselling author of Fight Club, did little to publicize his appearance as 
part of the University of Pittsburghs Contemporary Writers Series. Twice that day, 
he held court at Pitts Alumni Hall auditorium, with lectures followed by screenings 
of Fight Club.
His afternoon appearance was more intimate, but by evening, the word had gotten 
out. The packed auditorium buzzed as the crowd clamored for novelty prizes like 
large plastic baby bottles, given to fans picked to ask questions about his life, his 
work, his celebrity status, and his fantasies.
When one fan asked whether he used libraries, he offered a unique rejoinder.
You want research? Call a phone sex chat line, one of those 900 ones. Say, hey, I 
want to get off on a hot brother-on-sister story. Literally you will have hundreds of 
horndogs coming onto that line and telling you stories, he said.
Like his characters, Palahniuk goes to support group meetings and twelve-step 
programs to collect other peoples thoughts.
Any place people go to tell their stories are excellent places to just hear the rich
ness and fantastically inspiring ideas and observations people have. Youre just con
stantly sort of touched and amazed by how brilliant people are, he said. Thats a 
hell of a lot better than sitting in a library. At any rate, I love the expression I get from 
my accountant when I see he gets a $900 sex chat phone bill.
Phone sex research is only one of the many occupations that have given Palahniuk 
his unusual perspective. After majoring in journalism at the University of Oregon 
and spending six months in a minimum-wage job with a local newspaper, he became 
a truck mechanic.
In his early thirties, Palahniuk began attending writing workshops with a few 
friends. It was there that his mentor, Tom Spanbauer, introduced him to Gordon 
Lischs technique of minimalism, for which Palahniuk is now known.
Writing had become a way of socializing, a way of being with people, so writing 
became a joy, he said. It was sort of like being in a band. You had five or four other 
people encouraging you. Supporting you. Being with you. It doesnt have to be this 
lonely thing.
Womens literature has reflected community for years, said Palahniuk; when he 
conceived Fight Club, he was setting out to define the same kind of community for 
men. He drew from  and inverted  the sewing circles and sisterhoods found in 
the popular genre of womens fiction to come up with Fight Club's grisly message.
I was ripping off Amy Tan, The Joy Luck Club. Women have a whole strain of books 
and they still have enormous successful books. The Joy Luck Club. How to Make An 
American Quilt. The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Basically, these movies and 
these books present a social model, a structure in which women can come together 
and share their lives, tell their stories to each other, he said.
But when it came to expressing the male psyche, there werent any social models 
in literature that worked, said Palahniuk.
Courtesy of Fox Films
There really werent any sort of books about that presented alternative social 
models for men to come together and share their lives, he said.
For inspiration on how to adapt the idea into male terms, Palahniuk turned to 
nature.
Fight Club is just sort of based on athletics. Its based on college and professional 
wrestling. Its based on how my dogs play. I really saw it more as play, really full out 
play, than as fighting or aggression or violence, he said. I cant write a book like 
that called Play Club or Laundry Club. It had to be a social model for men. 
Palahniuk finished the North American leg of his tour at Pitt. The writer will now 
move on to Europe to continue promoting his newest novel, Diary, about a womans 
investigation into the motives of her husbands botched suicide attempt through the 
cryptic messages scrawled on walls of rooms hed worked on as a carpenter.
Palahniuk is also the author of Survivor, Choke, Invisible Monsters, and Lullabye. 
Choke has been adapted to a screenplay and optioned by Artisan Entertainment, 
makers of Requiem for a Dream and jt./ *
Shooting will begin in the spring. Palaniuk is currently in development with 
Miramax Pictures for the rights to a film version of Invisible Monsters. Universal 
Studios is negotiating for the rights to Diary.
Now forty-one, Palahniuk resides in Portland, Oregon, where he continues to 
shake things up as a known member of the International Cacophony Society, 
whose sole dedication, according to its website, is to celebrate and emulate aes
thetic lumpiness and quixotic idiosyncrasies wherever they can be found.
As for other peoples opinions of his writing, Palahniuk has never been less inter
ested.
Heres a tip: when youre working on a writing project and people are interested 
in reading your work, always have a fart handy, he said. Itll chase them right 
away.

Dueling Improvs
Off The Top and the No Parking Players work hard to please Friday night audiences
Its fun, but sometimes embarrassing; its common at college campuses all over 
the country; and doing it, whether for an hour or 24 hours straight, can be really 
exhausting. Improv may be the most fun you can have with a roomful of strangers, 
and last Friday night, two campus troupes entertained crowds and themselves. 
Despite scheduling their performances on the same night, Scotch n Sodas No 
Parking Players and Off The Top get along great with each other.
It was National Talk Like A Pirate Day, and the No Parking Players were up to the 
challenge; their show, Improvisers of the Caribbean: The Curse of the No Parking 
Players, was supposed to be performed entirely in pirate voice. The seven per
forming members persevered with their piracy long enough to pay respect to the 
title of the show, but the evenings theme didnt stand in the way of other equally 
funny devices. During the course of the performance, the troupe parodied a halfdozen television shows, lampooned Elvis, Scotsmen, parrots, and everything and 
anything else that popped into their heads. As they streamed into the UCs 
Danforth Lounge to begin the show, a crowd had already been waiting for twenty 
minutes. Many of the same people come to all NPPs shows, said performing mem
ber Brian Gray, a sophomore IS major.
We offer two workshops a week, open to everybody, said Gray. The focus of 
our organization is more on the teaching aspect.
Some audience members are also members of the troupe who just come to the 
practices, but arent interested in performing just yet, said Gray.
The performance group is people who have come to enough workshops, who 
are experienced and know the basics of improv, said performing member Scott 
Dai, a junior CS major. We try hard not to give a sense that were above the rest of 
the membership.
Aleksey Kliger, a doctoral student in CS, had never performed with NPP before, 
but has been going to workshops since his first semester at CMU. He says he con
tinues to enjoy the workshops as a personal, high-energy way to relieve stress.
There are a lot of benefits to improv that arent directly rooted in performance, 
like having to think on your feet, he said.

Drew Pavelchak is held down by Joe Oduroe and Jason Boxerman as David Camillus 
looks on at Off The Tops show at The Frame last Friday.
Its a very therapeutic experience, said Phil Ayoub, a sophomore mechanical 
engineering major who joined NPP his first year. I try to come out at least once a 
week. I need a release  otherwise, Id go nuts. This is the only place you can go 
nuts with a whole bunch of people you dont know.
It takes a lot of courage to get up there, said Megan Flockin, a senior ethics, his
tory, public policy and English major. So even if its not always laugh-out-loud 
funny ... I certainly couldnt do it.
On the same night, at the other end of campus, another performance experiment 
was about to draw on a different kind of fortitude. Starting last Friday at 8 pm, the 
Off The Top players started doing improvisation at The Frame. They didnt stop 
until 8 pm the next day.
Im exhausted in many, many different ways, said John Oduroe, a CMU archi
tecture alumnus and troupe member, at the end of it all.
The 24-hour improv was their idea, and has never before been done at CMU. The 
event was set up in a series of intervals, each of which experimented with a partic
ular aspect of performing. From 8 pm until about 10 pm, the group performed 
straight, extended improvisation for an audience. After 10 pm, the audience was 
allowed to move around while the performances continued in various places, 
changing the atmosphere to a social event in which the audience could participate. 
As evening turned into morning, the actors changed from straight acting to some
thing more like rehearsal, critiquing their own work in front of the audience and 
allowing the audience members to participate. For most of the day Saturday, in 
between trying to catch a few hours of sleep, the actors allowed any interested 
audience to participate in open workshops. Finally, as the actors ceded to exhaus
tion, they wrapped up the evening with more longform, with the added incentive 
of free spaghetti for audience members. The troupes goal for the experiment was 
to learn as much as possible about how playing off the responses of different kinds 
of audiences would affect the improv.
Its one thing to perform in different places, but when youre in the same place, 
and that place is constantly changing around you, what does that feel like? How 
does that change? How do you react to that? How would we react to that? asked 
Oduroe. The experience was something of an ordeal; aside from not sleeping and 
keeping up a constant energy level, the actors had to contend with having no place 
to change or shower.
We have a bathroom with a toilet but its uber-stanky, so we try to stay out of 
there, said John Thompson, an undeclared sophomore from the University of 
Pittsburgh. Generally we all smell kind of bad.
Its still worth it, but I dont think Id do it again. I think once did it, said 
Oduroe. In the meantime, the group has The Frame reserved until Wednesday and 
plans to leave up the wall display that cropped up during the show. Photos taken 
by audience members throughout the night and posted by the hour fill one wall, 
next to the groups mission statement and a sign-in sheet that holds around a hun
dred names, Camillus estimated. Although they dont yet have a calendar for the 
year, they expect to do a show about once every five weeks; once hooked, several 
members agreed, its hard to get enough.
Its really, really hard to stay focused for that length of period. But its very inter
esting to see people almost have to stop being creative and start working off them
selves, and who they really are. All the faades break down, said Bill Schott, a jun
ior art major. And you get to see people get wet.

Trip: the light fantastic
Wood Street Galleries showcases the beauty of LED technology
Most people who pour in and out of the commuter 
train station at the corner of Wood Street and Liberty 
Avenue every morning and evening do not have the 
time to look up, but if they did, they would be staring 
directly at some of the most innovative art in town.
Located directly above the Wood and Sixth Street 
metro station, the Wood Street Galleries strive to 
import cutting-edge artists whose work relies heavily 
on the conceptual. Its current exhibit, After Image, dis
plays the multitude of uses of light-emitting diode 
(LED) technology and the many ways in which art can 
be absorbed.
Works by the three featured artists  Erwin Rendl, 
Jim Campbell, and Leo Villareal  use LEDs, which 
use a certain type of circuit to emit light, typically in a 
pinpoint.
Some are arranged in the form of screens that dis
play pictures much like the simplest of computer 
screens, but because most of the art in the exhibit is not 
representational, it is processed by the eye and emo
tions more directly.
The ideas that the artists are trying to express are 
very straightforward. The viewer intuitively knows 
what the artist is trying to say, said curator Murray 
Horne.
The confusion of the senses starts with the entrance 
to the first piece of art. Erwin RendFs Matrix II fills an 
empty white gallery with a three-dimensional grid of
pinpoint green lights.
Depending upon the viewers place in the room, the 
lights can look well-defined and geometric by creating 
a pattern of squares, or more difficult to organize into 
shapes; this illustrates the idea that the viewers under
standing of art can be changed by his physical location. 
The interactive nature of this art  people can and do 
walk into the grid  allows the viewer to take in the 
experience by being a part of it, and prepares him or 
her for the other pieces.
Rendls other piece of art also focuses on the posi
tioning of small pinpoint lights. Flow, a blanket of red 
lights covering the side of the Wood Street T station, 
also plays off of the idea of perspective; the size and 
location of this piece allows external forces like weath
er and position of the sun to influence how the artwork 
looks and flows across the building.
While Rendls art focuses mainly on the idea of per
spective, Jim Campbell has brought back the concept 
of impressionism within LED technology; with more 
pinpoint lights, he reduces the information the viewer 
sees to the minimum necessary to understand an 
image.
Campbells Motion and Rest Series consists of 
screens with a moving image created by distinct points 
of light. Each of the screens depicts a person with a 
walking impediment moving or resting. Despite its out
line in what seem like huge pixels, the viewer is still 
able to recognize the human form, and its movements
are realistic enough to win an instinctual sense of 
empathy.
Campbells other piece, Wavelengths, which consists 
of five screens each depicting part of a wave?s travel 
from sea to shore, subverts the typical idea of how to 
view museum art. When standing near it, the viewer is 
unable to comprehend the image, but can distinguish 
what is happening up close if he or she already knows 
what the actual image is.
Leo Villareal, focuses on the color of light and how it 
affects awareness of surroundings. His piece 
Lightscape is a computer program that projects upon a 
screen different colors and patterns over a strong grid 
pattern. The sequence of colors flows from calm pastel 
colors to extreme, emotional reds and deep blues.
The idea of perception comes into play as the levels 
of light emitted by the display fluctuate to make the 
rest of the room becomes clear or invisible. Between 
cycles, the display fades to black, leaving the room in 
complete darkness.
Like Rendls Flow, both of the other artists have work 
positioned around downtown near the museum. 
Villareals Sequencing Experiments and Campbells 
Untitled are presented on the Jumbotron screen locat
ed at Theater Square. The exhibit runs through 
October 25. Call 412.471.5605 for more information.

MXPX/Vertical Horizon
On the path to stardom, genuine potential can be a dangerous thing
Before Everything & After, MXPX, A&M, September 16, 2003
Be true to yourself/ And stop tryin to be just like somebody else, sings MXPX on 
Play It Loud, one of many shiny, happy tracks on the bands latest album, which, 
ironically, could use a healthy dose of that very advice. Unlike previous recordings, 
Before Everything & After is disappointingly like everything else on top-40 radio.
The lyrics are trite, and the music is indistinguishable from all the other pop-punk 
acts clogging the airwaves. Its sad because MXPX used to be original. They put on 
a great show. But with this release, its obvious that theyre pandering to the legions 
of Good Charlotte and Sum 41 fans around the world. That isnt necessarily a bad 
thing  the lyrics are positive, the three chords are played with energy, and its 
easy to picture an arena full of people jumping up and down with big smiles on their 
faces.
All bands change during the course of their careers, especially ones that begin as 
early as MXPX did. They formed in their sophomore year of high school, got signed 
to Seattle-based Tooth & Nail Records as seniors, and left on their first national tour 
the day after graduation. Released during high school, their first two albums, 
1994s Pokinatcha, 1995s Teenage Politics, and other early CDs helped spread the 
concept of Christian punk beyond the boundaries of the Christian community. 
Their infectious beats and astute lyrics were a rare combination in religious music, 
especially at that time. Their first few albums established them as frontrunners in 
the still-underground pop-punk genre.
So where are they now? Some fans would be pleased by Before Everything & 
Afters improved production quality. However, theyve traded rough for too slick  
Before Everything & After is hopelessly overproduced. Its very accessible music, and 
since theyve been teetering on the edge of the underground for a while, this album 
will probably tip them into stardom.
That said, the album is a bit derivative. Well-Adjusted, the second song on the
album, would fit disturbingly well onto a Green Day album, and the rest of it i 
much more original. Every CD MXPX puts out moves them a little farther away fi 
Christian punk towards pop stardom. And thats fine; it sells. MXPXs salad days 
over, for better or for worse.
Go, Vertical Horizon, RCA Records, September 23, 2003
DJs for a top 40 station on the lookout for something to contrast with all the R 
tinged pop besides Creed  are in luck, as are fans who love outstandingly gei 
ic rock; Go, the new Vertical Horizon CD, comes out on Tuesday. It unflinchir 
delivers 11 tracks of music carefully designed to be not too hard, not too soft, 
just right for fans whose other favorite bands are Third Eye Blind and 3 Dc 
Down. It wont rock anyones socks off, but itll certainly rock them back and fo 
perhaps even in time to the beat.
In all honesty, this album isnt bad. Go will continue Vertical Horizons imme 
popularity that stemmed from their major label debut, Everything You W< 
However, there isnt a song that stands out with great potential to become a bre 
away hit, as the title track from Everything You Want did. The first single off of 
Im Still Here, is a standard boy-loves-girl, girl-leaves-boy, boy-is-sad lament w 
out much else to recommend or distinguish it.
Parts of the album do show musical progress, however. Inside, the secom 
last song on the disk, has a marvelous intro that lets a full string section carry 
melody while the guitar and bass interact sparsely in the background. This s> 
could be a hit, as it has a sort of emotional immediacy that most of the rest of 
album lacks. The lyrics of Go are good but in no way great. The instrumentals 
mediocre and unoriginal. The songs never venture beyond love and breakups, 
do they offer insight on either.
Seeking corporate-flavored rock thats appropriate to play while babysitti 
Vertical Horizons Go will do  but just barely.

Johnny Cash: 1932-2003Man in Black
Cash was a singular presence
I was hoping to start this piece with a telling story of 
how I discovered Johnny Cash in the angst and anger 
of my adolescence, or inside a bottle during a drunken 
stupor, or maybe even at the end of some shift when 
my feet were sore and my head ached. But to be hon
est, Johnny Cash has always just been there.
Even before the world knew it, he was the definition 
of cool: authentic, ingenious and hell-bent on sticking 
out like a hitchhikers thumb. Born and raised in 
Arkansas, John R. Cash started writing songs at age
12, inspired by the country music he heard locally and 
on his radio. After finishing college, he moved for a 
short time to Detroit before joining the Air Force at the 
beginning of the Korean War. Once his stint in the 
service was over, Cash moved to Memphis, where he 
formed a trio with guitarist Luther Perkins (brother of 
[Dont You Step On My] Blue Suede Shoes writer 
Carl Perkins) and upright bass player Marshall Grant, 
and almost immediately set to courting the interest of 
Sun Records owner Sam Phillips. Though he turned 
down Cashs first demos, which were more in line with 
a country gospel approach, Phillips liked what he 
heard in Hey Porter, a song about the joy of a man 
returning to the south on a train, and released it on 
the B-side of the classic Cry, Cry, Cry. The single was 
a solid hit, and Cashs career started in earnest.
The first great period in Cashs career started about 
the same time as rock and roll began its rise to popu
larity. I Walk the Line, Cashs first #1 record, hit the 
charts in 1956, the year after Chuck Berry released 
Maybelline and the year before Buddy Holly 
released Thatll Be the Day. At first glance, the ener
gy that drives this early rock seems to be the same 
force that makes Cashs early work so compelling and 
captivating. His rebelliousness, swaggering tone, and 
some of the instrumental similarities seem to rein
force this  the interplay between Cashs rhythm gui
tar and Luther Perkinss lead can sound a lot like thenSun Records label mate Elvis Presley and his lead play
er Scotty Moore  but that is where the similarities 
end.
Even on those early records, Cashs aesthetic was 
laced with traces of the conflict common to many 
singers from the beginning of the American recording 
industry (soul singer Sam Cooke is another example). 
Artists raised in the gospel tradition were being asked 
by their managers and record companies to produce 
records that sold, which in country music were songs 
about honky-tonkin and hell-raising. Walking the line 
between the sinfully secular and the righteous but 
broke became both a musical and personal theme that 
continued throughout Cashs life.
But that same duality was part of what helped him 
straddle the lines between genres. In 1959, the year 
after he left Sun for Columbia Records, Cashs Dont 
Take Your Guns to Town became a crossover success 
when, after hitting #1 on the country charts, it rose to 
the top of the pop charts as well. This was followed by 
a string of slightly more modest successes, including 
Frankies Man Johnny and Five Feet High and 
Rising. Success was sometimes a burden too heavy to 
bear; around the same time as his crossover boom, 
Cash developed an addiction to the amphetamines he 
took to help him through the 300 shows on average 
that he played a year. By 1963, this addiction had 
become debilitating, causing the stream of hit singles 
to slow to a trickle, and causing Johnny to move to 
New York, leaving his wife and family behind.
There was a brief comeback in 1964 with Ring of 
Fire, a tune written by June Carter, daughter of coun
try music pioneers The Carter Family, about the 
descent into a maddening love which the singer com
pares to a ring of fire, an analogy equally applicable to 
Cashs raging addiction. However, the comeback did 
not last long; 1965 saw Cash arrested in El Paso for 
attempting to smuggle amphetamines into the United 
States in his guitar case. Shortly thereafter, he kicked 
out the footlights at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville 
when they refused to book him, beginning a feud with 
the Nashville country elite that would last till his 
death.
This feud is one of Cashs greatest legacies to coun
try music, starting what has become almost a tradition 
of animosity between rhinestone-studded Nashville 
and the renegade country artists such as Willie 
Nelson, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earl, etc.  those 
willing to work outside the polished and static world 
of contemporary country. After his wife Vivian 
divorced him in 1966, Cash moved to Nashville, 
where, after a period of raising hell, he beat his addic
tions and recorded another string of hits including 
Jackson, a duet with June Carter, who had been a 
major force behind his recovery and whom he would 
marry in 1968. The second great period in Cashs 
career began with the release of Johnny Cash at 
Folsom Prison, his best-selling album, and a chart-top
ping #1 hit at the time. Its release began a string of 
socially aware albums, including another live-inprison album, Johnny Cash at San Quentin, and Bitter 
Tears, an album created to build awareness of the 
plight of American Indians.
Cash once again built up momentum, scoring num
ber one hits off of both prison albums (Folsom Prison 
Blues, and A Boy Named Sue, respectively), appear
ing on Bob Dylans 1969 country-rock effort 
Nashville Skyline, and hosting his own short-lived 
variety show on ABC.
Cashs early seventies singles show a man aging 
gracefully but still not willing to be old. From the per
fect spiritual hangover soundtrack of Sunday 
Morning Coming Down to the guarded condemna
tion of the war in Vietnam The Man In Black, he 
made visceral and real records at a time when many 
artists were experimenting with the lighter side of 
country-rock songwriting.
In the late seventies and through most of the eight
ies, Cashs sales and popularity declined. With the 
exception of a few chart-reaching hits such as Ghost 
Riders In the Sky, and a few collaborations in the 
mid-eighties with Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, 
and Kris Kristopherson under the name the 
Highwaymen, Cashs visibility dropped mightily as 
disco and more polished country music grew in pop
ularity.
It was in the early nineties that the third period of 
his career began, when, after switching labels twice, 
he recorded the elemental country album American 
Recordings for Rick Rubins American Records. This 
and the series of albums that followed featured beau
tifully raw takes on tunes ranging from traditional 
country tunes to Cashs interpretations of a new gen
eration of songwriters work. Everything his voice 
touched glowed with a fragile understanding of the 
ravages of time (Trent Reznors Hurt, Will Oldhams 
I See a Darkness) and the pleasures of a simpler life 
(his own Country Trash, and Gallespie and Smiths 
Lucky Old Son). At their lightest, Cashs tunes can 
be novelty ditties (One Piece at A Time, in which an 
assembly line worker  a job that Cash held for a 
short while in the early fifties  steals a car piece by 
piece over a period of twenty years, only to find that 
the pieces arent compatible) or nostalgic fluff 
(Daddy Sang Bass, in which the singer reminisces 
about a quaint musical childhood). At their best, they 
explore the fine line between strength and weakness, 
pleasure and addiction, as well as examining the 
archetypes of good and bad, and how easy it can be to 
be bad, and how very hard it can be to be good.
What makes Johnny Cash singular is that while 
many comparable artists (Hank Williams, Robert 
Johnson, et al.) made compelling material out of chas
ing redemption, Cash had tasted it and knew that 
redemption wasnt the same as satisfaction. He strove 
throughout his life to connect and balance the ele
ments he was built of; his addictive weakness and reli
gious strength, his love of country music and his dis
trust of Nashville, to produce truer music and strive 
toward perfection as a human being. When he died 
last week at 71, he had come as close, as anyone ever 
has to either.

The talk of the town
A few commercial sources have also influenced the 
language. Klondike ice cream bars and chipped 
ham came from the Isal^s company. The origin of 
gumband is suspected to be a market name for rub
ber bands. Jumbo lunchmeat also came from a com
mercial source.
Carnegie Mellon drama professor Natalie Baker 
Shirer attributes the Pittsburgh dialect to the workers 
Andrew Carnegie brought into the city for his facto
ries. They came from the East End of London, some
times called Cockney, and had many similar speech 
patterns to the lower-class dialect spoken by its resi
dents.
A characteristic of the Pittsburgh dialect is that the 
ls, like those of the Cockney people, are always swal
lowed. They say skoo, instead of school. Sometimes 
the sound comes out as a w, for example the 
Stillwers,  said Baker Shirer.
Celanie Polanick/Pillbox Editor
Paul Shatlock and Lenny Lucas toast the Steelers during lunch at Sigma Phi Epsilon.
When the Stillers are playing dahntahn, its impor
tant to remember to pack some jumbo (bologna), some 
pop (soda), some Ahrn (Iron City Beer), and some 
pierogies, wrap them up in a big gumband (rubber 
band), and make sure to drive dahn ere in plenty of 
time to beat the crahds.
But before leaving the hahs, it might be a good idea 
to redd up (clean) the place, and maybe run the sweep
er (vacuum the floor) so that no one finds the carpet 
too slippy. (Might want to trim the jagger bush out
side, too.)
The more often students venture off-campus, the 
more Pittsburghese they will hear. And though the 
Pittsburgh dialect has not gone unnoticed locally or 
elsewhere, local residents often are unaware that their 
speech is any different from anyone elses.
Myron Cope, the WDVE sports announcer famous 
for his Pittsburghese, never realized that he had an 
accent until a few years ago.
I argued with my friend for years that I did not have 
an accent, and that I sounded the same as people in 
many other areas of the country. Finally, one day I 
went out to lunch with my friend and several other 
gentlemen. I had to repeat myself to one man from 
Florida several times because, as my friend explained, 
he couldnt understand my accent, he said. That was 
when I stopped disputing that I had a Pittsburgh 
accent.
But the sounds and phrases many people think of as 
unique to Pittsburgh speech have origins elsewhere, 
said Carnegie Mellon professor of rhetoric and linguis
tics Barbara Johnstone, whose extensive research of 
the dialect has concluded that Pittsburgh speech
shares many traits with the speech of the Appalachian 
region.
Words such as yinz are found throughout the 
Appalachians in various forms such as youuns. The 
grammatical construction of needs washed is used 
further to the west through the central Midwest. Also, 
the pronunciation of steel as still can be heard 
throughout the country. Even the most local features 
of Pittsburghese can be heard in a fairly large area of 
central and southwestern Pennsylvania.
This dialect can be attributed to the first Englishspeaking settlers of the area and later immigrant set
tlers. According to Johnstone, many of these first set
tlers of the Pittsburgh and Appalachian areas came 
from northern England and Ireland.
The northern English settlers, including Quakers, 
first came to eastern Pennsylvania and then migrated 
west to central and western Pennsylvania. Scotch-Irish 
(also called Scots-Irish) immigrants, who had migrat
ed from Scotland to Northern Ireland, later settled in 
the Pittsburgh area, and brought with them nebby, 
slippy, and redd up, phrases still used all over the 
region today.
The grammatical structure of needs washed and 
using the word diamond to signify town square also 
owe their origination to the Scotch-Irish immigrants. 
There is still a Diamond Street in downtown 
Pittsburgh.
Some foreign contributions to Pittsburgh language 
eventually appeared elsewhere, but some never left 
Pittsburgh. The early German population brought 
words with them such as Gesundheit and sauer
kraut. African-Americans introduced as slaves
Another one of the most noticeable characteristics 
of Pittsburgh speech is flat vowel sounds. The ow 
sound in downtown, house, and Southside is replaced 
with an ah sound to produce dahntahn, hahs, 
and Sahside, spoken with a. nasal tone.
The Pittsburgh dialect is thought of as being very 
lazy, since the lips arent used. It is also somewhat 
closed off because of the nasal and hard r sounds, 
said Baker Shirer. Pittsburghers tend to glottalize 
sounds and ignore diphthongs when they speak. This 
is Western Pennsylvania, so that means that its speech 
is influenced somewhat by Appalachia, the Cockney 
from way back, and German.
Even within the city, said Shirer, different neighbor
hoods have their own versions of the dialect.
The South Side is different from the North Side. 
They take one particular characteristic, such as nasali
ty, and use it more. Squirrel Hill has a more nasal 
sound than other parts of the city, she said.
Each sub-dialect of Pittsburgh may have its idiosyn
crasies, but sometimes, the dialect may be an effort to 
blend in, said Johnstone.
Theres preliminary evidence, and it would not be 
surprising, that the local accent is the strongest among 
working-class men. It has to do with the social value of 
sounding like a regular guy. In manufacturing jobs, it 
doesnt really matter what your accent is. The real 
social value is in sounding like the other guys. Even the 
managers might want to sound like the other guys, 
said Johnstone.
I think a lot of it has to do with occupation. Bluecollar workers dont have to constantly think of using 
proper speech. Its acceptable to use their slang, said 
Paul Sciullo, a native Bloomfield resident.
College professors from out of town like to do 
papers on Pittsburghese, said Cope, and I always
When it comes to regional dialects, native Pittsburghers gotta leg up on yinz guys
brought widespread words such as jazz. The words 
babushka, salami, pierogi, halushky, and 
flanken came from the languages of continental 
European immigrants.

detect a certain amount of snottiness in the papers and 
articles that Ive seen in the newspapers.
Some of the same sounds Johnstone researched can 
be heard on campus; with a high concentration of local 
students, Pittsburgh pride is every bit as present here 
as it is Dahntahn. But most of the CMU community 
doesnt respond positively to that sound, *says senior 
mechanical engineering major Lenny Lucas.
People think [Pittsburghese] is on a different level, 
he said, putting fries on his sandwich in typical local 
style at Sigma Phi Epsilon last Wednesday at lunch. 
People really notice it, and they think it means were 
really dumb. The Boston accent, people arent dumber 
for having it, but a Pittsburgh accent makes people 
assume the worst.
I redd up my room a lot, agreed senior IS major 
Paul Shatlock, demonstrating how easy it is for him to 
lapse into Pittsburghese. My mom used to run the 
sweeper all the time. I just found out yesterday that 
that was a Pittsburghism.
Shatlock and Lucas decided to live together because 
of the Pittsburgh connection, and recorded a 
Pittsburghese version of a popular Christmas carol 
about Santa Claus, in which he comes dahntahn. It was 
nice to have someone with whom to joke about local 
culture and watch local sports teams, said Shatlock; 
the transition to college was tough enough to digest 
sometimes.
In my [high school] senior class, when we were get
ting ready to graduate, we actually had a seminar 
about not saying yinz,  said Shatlock. Until recently, 
he said, he used the same vowel sound for pole and 
pool, and couldnt hear the difference.
None of us really knew that it was Pittsburgh lan
guage or dialect until we started to mix with people 
from other places, said senior mechanical engineering 
major Justin Marini.
Typical of the ethnic makeup of Pittsburgh, the her
itage of the three fraternity brothers reflects Italian, 
German and Eastern European heritage; Shatlock used 
to be spelled Shattlach, he said, and Lucas was once 
Lukachevitz.
Things like saying something needs fixed still 
creep into their vocabulary sometimes.
The other day at crew practice, I said the boats 
needed rigged, and they said, What?  said Marini.
Yinz comes out all the time. Im never going to get 
rid of that, said Lucas.
But for true sports fans, Pittsburgh pride comes in 
handy on the dating scene, said Shatlock, who once 
met a Pittsburgh girl in Ohio who loved the Steelers 
and the Penguins as much as he did.
Were right in the middle of making out, and we dis
engage for a second, and she goes, God damn, I hate 
the Browns!\and then we kept kissing, he said. It was 
the hottest thing ever.
Its in our best interest to scare all normal people 
away so we meet more people like us, joked Lucas.
The dialect also lends a human touch that can dif
fuse potentially dangerous situations, said Shatlock.
Once, we were drinking after a Steelers game, and 
we were making noise and shouting at some people in 
the street, and the cops came, said Shatlock. We 
ended up engaging him in conversation, and eventual
ly admitted we were the ones making noise, because 
we were celebrating the Steelers victory. Aint nothin 
wrong with that, the cop said, and just went away. As 
the car drove around the block, the bullhorn came out,
and the dude said, in a very official voice, Go Steelers!if
Still, some people will always feel self-conscious and 
try to hide the fact that they are from Pittsburgh. 
Shatlock and Lucass apartment wall features a lifesized cutout of Christina Aguilera, who grew up in 
Wexford, a half-hours drive north of the city; she 
famously tries to mask her local connections, and 
never mentions Pittsburgh. Shatlock has proof, in the 
form of a tape of an old Penguins game, where a 
twelve-year-old Aguilera sang the national anthem.
She should be proud. Im proud. You guys sahnd 
like youre not prahd, he laughed, switching to 
Pittsbughese to accuse Marini and Lucas.
Im not proud. Its weird, said Marini. Sometimes 
it comes out without my wanting it to.
When the three went to the recent Technical and 
Business Opportunities Conferences, Shatlock said, he 
chatted with recruiters from Pittsburgh without feel
ing self-conscious at all.
Tell everyone theyre overanalyzing things, he 
said. We sound fine.
But to Baker Shirer, region-neutral speech repre
sents a quality of education not afforded to everyone. 
Her project, Speech Phonetics Instruction and 
Outreach Course (SPIOC) tutors students at Holy 
Rosary in Homewood, St. Agnus in Lower Oakland, 
and St. James in Wilkinsburg, where the fifth grade 
classes spend one year trying to speak without any 
regional sounds or phrases.
Each Friday, CMU theater students who have taken 
Baker Shirers Speech and Phonetics meet at the UC 
turnaround and head to three local parochial schools 
in disadvantaged neighborhoods to teach local ele
mentary school children how to speak the neutral 
dialect, Standard American English.
[The children] say dahn as in I want to go dahn
tahn, Humstead instead of Homestead, and Stillers. 
Theres definitely a dialect within the community, 
said Johanna Brickey, a sophomore drama major.
Baker Shirer was invited to create SPIOC by the 
Extra Mile program, a charity started by local busi
nessmen who raised millions of dollars to keep open 
Catholic schools about to be closed by the bishop due 
to lack of funds and sliding academic standards.
[The community] realized that their way of speak
ing was holding them back later in life. Were giving 
them an optional dialect to try for a year to see if they 
like it, but were never telling them to turn their back 
on their heritage, said Baker Shirer. Now people real
ize that speech is the last great cosmetic. You can get 
your hair done and dress appropriately, but how you 
sound is even more important.
Gwendolyn Young, the principal of Holy Rosary, 
commented on the importance of the SPIOC program 
in her school.
When our students leave and move on they are 
aware that they can participate in whats going on in 
the world. They have a say, or at least have a voice that 
will be heard. The only way to do that is to communi
cate clearly, she said. The program teaches children 
how important the voice can be, while we stress the 
importance of knowing who you are and where you 
came from.
But acknowledging our roots is important, too; 
according to Rick Sebak of WQED, Pittsburghese only 
makes Pittsburgh a better place.
Im thankful that some people around here still 
speak with a Pittsburgh twang, or dialect, because its 
nice, he said. Its something that I like along with the 
fact that we have Primantis sandwiches, and still have 
inclines. These are all things that make Pittsburgh dif
ferent from other cities, and I think all of those things 
are good.
I often drop the verb to be and will catch myself say
ing the car needs washed or the bed needs made. 
Thats another Pittsburgh thing which I think is kind of 
fun, Sebak said. Ive come to sort of appreciate it as a 
part of Pittsburgh culture, which is sometimes not cel
ebrated in the way that it could be.

Left Cold
As a pale imitation of Hitchcock, Cold Creek Manor falls fiat
Classic suspense films like J. Lee Thompsons Cape 
Fear, Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window, or Brian 
DePalmas Blow Out manage to grip the audiences 
attention and make them desperate to know what will 
happen next. Unfortunately, Mike Figgis new film Cold 
Creek Manor doesnt live up to its heritage, or its prom
ising setup: the affluent Tilson family, desperate to get 
away from the dangers of Manhattan, buys a creepy 
house in upstate New York. They are able to afford it 
because the bank foreclosed on the previous owner, 
Dale Massie (Stephen Dorff). Cooper Tilson (Dennis 
Quaid) is a documentary filmmaker who is excited 
about researching the history of Cold Creek Manor. His 
wife, Leah (Sharon Stone), is a business executive who 
dreads abandoning her career for a life in a one-horse 
hayseed town. Together, the Tilsons explore their new 
house and try to make friends with the unfriendly, 
insular locals.
The trouble begins when Dale gets out of prison and 
comes back to visit. Dale invites himself to stay and 
help renovate Cold Creek Manor. From the very begin
ning, it is obvious that Dale is supposed to be unlikeable. He gets into fights, he hits on Mrs. Tilson, and he 
beats his trashy girlfriend Ruby (Juliette Lewis). It is 
also obvious that Dale is not too happy about having
lost his house to a bunch of city slickers. When strange 
things start happening around the house, there is only 
one person that could possibly be the bad guy, but 
Cooper takes much longer to figure this out than the 
audience does. Usually, this sort of dramatic irony 
would create suspense. In Cold Creek Manor, however, 
there isnt enough happening to make the audience 
care about the flat characters or the weak plot.
Who put the snakes under the bed? Who tried to run 
Cooper off the road? Who cares? After Figgis other 
acclaimed films, Leaving Las Vegas and the innovative 
split-screen experiment Timecode, its surprising that 
he could create a film with so many tired clichs and 
predictable moments. The plot borrows directly from 
several other better films. A beloved pet is dispatched  
la Fatal Attraction. Someone falls down a well  la The 
Ring (or Silence of the Lambs, for that matter). The 
characters in this film do things that make no sense. 
Why do victims always run up onto the roof when a 
killer is after them? Why would a person lean over an 
abandoned well in the middle of the woods at night 
with a killer on the loose? The characters constantly do 
ridiculous things in order to expedite the plot, and the 
results are both predictable and frustrating.
Courtesy of Buena Vista Pictures
Quaid is decent as Cooper, but never seems invested 
in his role. He delivers his lines like he has somewhere 
else to be. Stone, who has all the warmth of an Eskimo 
Pie, creates absolutely no chemistry with Quaid or 
with Dorff, to whom the film really belongs. His per
formance as Dale is both amusing and poignant. He 
makes a frightening villain and has some of the best 
lines in the movie. As he threatens Cooper with a ham
mer, he shouts, Let me ask you two questions. Do you 
think Im crazy? No? Wrong. Let me ask you another 
question... oh, f*** it, lets just do this.
After almost two hours, the audience is really grate
ful for a villain just wants to get on with it and kill the 
family, already.
mpEEn mwyeNcl6 SPlbp, oAcrrt,bAT,Underdone
Underworld feels like a video game  enough to warrant a lawsuit
Simply put, Underworld is a lot like Romeo and 
Juliet  except with guns, vampires, leather, and a 
lot of rain.
In Underworld, however, the feud is between vam
pires and Lycans (or werewolves). Selene (Kate 
Beckinsale) is a werewolf hunter. A vampire death 
dealer, she runs around the streets in a black leather 
trenchcoat, stalking known Lycans and executing 
them. Soon, she thinks, she will be out of a job; the 
vampire leadership believes that the Lycan leader, 
Lucian (Michael Sheen), is dead, and that the species 
is on the brink of extinction. The Lycans are after a 
hospital intern named Michael Corvin (Scott 
Speedman). Though human, he is a direct descendant 
of the forefather of all vampires  and in his blood is 
the key to ending the conflict. But true to the films 
Shakespearean roots, a coup is brewing within the 
vampire bureaucracy. Kraven (Shane Bolly), a vam
pire, wants power, and the easiest way he knows to get 
it is to become the leader of the vampires. He has no 
ties to either side of the larger battle, but makes a deal 
with a still-living Lucian (whom he supposedly killed 
centuries ago) to help him rise to power.
Selene finds out that the Lycans are tracking 
Corvin, uncovers the fact that Lucian is still alive,
awakens the former vampire leader, Viktor (Bill 
Nighy), and somehow manages to fall in love with 
Corvin, an act that goes completely against the vam
pire covenant. After the Lycans assassinate a vam
pire elder, Viktor leads a posse to attack them and kill 
Kraven. The climactic battle between Corvin, Selene, 
and Viktor blatantly sets the movie up for a sequel.
The performers almost manage to rise above the 
material they were given  almost. Beckinsale makes 
a convincing hunter and handles her guns confidently. 
Speedman doesnt have to do much besides act con
fused, which he executes admirably.
Nighy believably creates an imposing image for 
powerful patriarch Viktor, and Bellys crafty work as 
the mutinous Kraven is as authentic as it is fun to 
watch.
All in all, however, this movie relies on archetypes as 
a vampire subsists on blood. Cliched characters and 
situations abound: warring factions, forbidden love, 
betrayal, and power struggles between the undead 
would be hard to resuscitate regardless, but without 
some original element to keep it conscious, the 
movies credibility goes under immediately and never 
recovers. None of it is very original, but at least its
entertaining.
Underworld would have been received with open 
arms as a typical summer movie if it hadnt been 
released a little too late. Its not of the caliber of Blade, 
or even of other more serious vampire movies, but two 
months ago, audiences might have swallowed it with
out chewing. As the weather turns colder, though, 
new releases are measured against the tightening 
autumn standards that always lead up to winters 
Oscar race and the flurry of heavy-duty dramas that 
come with it. In Underworlds case, all the thrills and 
chills are simply too little, too late.
And apparently, being derivative is sometimes more 
than an artistic problem. Sony Pictures, Underworlds 
distributor, is currently being sued on seventeen 
counts of copyright infringement and unfair business 
practices by White Wolf Incorporated, the publishing 
company responsible for the role-playing game 
Vampire: The Masquerade. Underworld shares an 
alarming number of plot elements and details with 
the world of Vampire: The Masquerade, which are 
detailed at http://www.penny-arcade.com/dl/whitewolfcomplaint.pdf.

The tender trap
Bob Lott puts the ninny back in femininity
All you have to do is get up, dust yourself off, get on your bicycle, and go find 
him, tigress!
So proclaims Bob Lott in his ridiculous and insulting relationship guide, How to 
Date and Marry a Wonderful Man. In fifteen succinct chapters, Lott gives his read
ers terrible advice on how to overcome fear, meet a wonderful man, hold on to him 
and, eventually, marry him. It is important to note that Lott, a native Pittsburgher 
and former Pitt student, is not a doctor of medicine, psychology, counseling, or 
divinity. Rather, he has a doctorate in marketing. This is not very surprising, as his 
prose reads very much like the spiel of a traveling salesman. His approach to 
attracting the opposite sex could be used just as well to sell swampland in Florida. 
The book itself is filled with condescension, absurdity, and incompetence. He plays 
fast and loose with grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Lott has the discon
certing habit of trying to convey emotion by using all capital letters.
People substitute worldly pleasures and activities to fill a void, because they 
have no REAL LOVE in their lives, he fairly shouts, as if using instant messenger 
software. Throughout, he hovers a few emoticons away from having the narrative 
voice of a fourteen-year-old girl. The main problem with Lotts book, however, lies 
not in its technical construction but in its content. Most of his counsel is blatantly 
sexist.
You must no longer be that dominant, aggressive, repulsive, female you.... You, 
as a woman, must become kind, considerate, respectful, loyal, thoughtful, gener
ous and passive with todays men, he writes. Ladies, put down that briefcase and 
slap on that apron: you need all of your energy to keep your man happy. Some of 
Lotts advice is worded so oddly that the reader might be too confused to be offend
ed: Here is where you must show him that you are the weaker sex (swallow your 
pride). He is the stronger sex who will take you in his arms and lick and heal your 
wounds, reviving you to good health. Oddly enough, however, Lott inverts gender 
stereotypes at certain points in the book  but with the same larger-than-life sex
ism as before. He depicts women as violent, nymphomaniacal savages.
The hunter (woman) goes after the hunted (man). With her war club, she 
expects to clonk him in the head and drag him to her cave.
The book insinuates that most women are oversexed tigresses with anger man
agement issues. While most women would disagree with this accusation, they 
might find it refreshing to be insulted in such a non-traditional way. After all, it is 
much more common for women to be mocked for weakness than it is to be mocked 
for aggressiveness. The most uproarious advice that calls for a reversal of gender 
comes in Chapter 11, when he teaches women how to propose marriage to their 
wonderful men. It speaks for itself: When you propose, address him by his full 
name, asking him to marry you. Take the friendship ring (that you purchased espe
cially for him) out of your purse and place it on his ring finger.... Handle this right 
and hell magnetically draw towards you, and say yes after taking the time to 
think.
Although some of Lotts advice calls for a transposition of traditional gender 
roles, most of his hackneyed motivational pap reinforces the stereotypes that 
women have been trying to overcome for the past forty years.
Let him know that your life is wonderful and totally fulfilled by being with him, 
states Lott in the third chapter. In other words, women need men to be happy, and 
in order to get men they must become docile, man-worshipping sheep. As insulting 
as some of his implications are, Lott does provide some truly unique suggestions on 
how to pick up a man. The most amusing suggestion is to pick up men while driv
ing.
Bridget Lewis/Art Staff
Turn your head and make eye contact. Smile and ask him a question, whether 
at a traffic light or driving down the road. If hes interested, he will pull in at the 
next deli or restaurant and join you.
This advice might fit better in the book How to Get Car-Jacked by a Wonderful 
Man, or How to Have a Collision with a Wonderful Man..
This is not just bad advice. Its dangerous. Lotts double standard manifests itself 
perfectly in the titles he chooses. His other dating guide, for men, is called Dont Be 
Afraid to Ask: How to Date a Beautiful Woman, which sagely declares: Mens initial 
reactions are primal, simple, and to the point. Women are cool with that. Thats 
why that neurosurgeon gal is wearing the tube top/mini skirt.
The two books, when taken as a whole, form an alarming picture. The title How 
to Date a Beautiful Woman, when compared with How to Date and Marry a 
Wonderful Man, reinforces the antiquated notion that women only care about mar
riage and personality, and men only care about physical beauty. If women only care 
about marriage and men only care about getting beautiful women into bed, then 
there is no way any relationship can possibly work. Following his advice, there
fore, will lead only to the purchase of more self-help books. At last, they have found 
a way to self-replicate. Perhaps the strangest thing about How to Date and Marry a 
Wonderful Man is that Lott never clearly states exactly what constitutes a 
Wonderful Man. The endpaper reveals that Chris Steele, the cheery Adonis on 
the cover, was chosen because of his special inner qualities that women are look
ing for in a man. As his special inner qualities are not visible in the photograph, 
it is obvious he was chosen for his looks  maybe when Lott says wonderful, all 
he means is beautiful. Other than that, the book itself is vague on what it means 
to be wonderful. The only time Lott comes close to defining the term is when he 
writes, If hes wonderful, hes just a snap of his finger away from dumping you and 
finding someone else.
The only clear implication there is that a wonderful man is too good for anyone 
who doesnt cater to his every whim. By never developing the characteristics of a 
wonderful man clearly, Lott also indirectly implies that all women want the same 
exact thing. Well, they might not all want the same thing, but they probably would 
all agree that they dont want to shell out twenty bucks for this book.

Ever since that fateful day on the pond, Rupert and Amy were 
inseparable. They went to the park together, flew south together, 
voted together ... did everything as a pair. Their friendship prov 
gressed for many months and they grew very close. It was bittersweet J
for Rupert though, for he had fallen in love with his new friend. He 
tried to suppress his emotions for fear that his love would be unrequited. Finally his 
torturecf soul could not conceal his true feelings for Amy any longer. He looked deep 
into Amys eyes and told her that he loved her. But Rupert was unaware that behind 
those big, bright eyes, Amy had an even bigger secret.

I SEE THAT YOU'VE 
CLEVERLY AVOIDED MY 
ACTUAL QUESTION IN 
FAVOR OF AN IMAGI
NARY ONE INVOLVING 
DELIVERY TIKES.
NOW I'M FANTASIZING 
ABOUT RIPPING OFF 
YOUR MUSTACHE AND 
USING IT TO SHINE 
YOUR HEAD.
I HEAR THAT 
A LOT.
STEP ONE : BECOME 
A CEO. STEP TWO : BE 
THE SORT OF PERSON 
WHO WOULD BUY THESE 
AUDIO LESSONS.
ARE
YOU
TIRED?
I AM TRAINED 
TO ONLY SLEEP 
DURING 
NATIONAL 
HOLIDAYS.
AT THE INDIA INSTI
TUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, 
I LEARNED TO USE 
MY HUGE BRAIN.
BUT I TRY NOT TO 
FRIGHTEN ORDINARY 
PEOPLE WITH ANY 
GRATUITOUS DISPLAYS 
OF MENTAL SUPERI
ORITY.
003
FOR EXAMPLE, I NO 
LONGER REHEAT MY 
TEA BY HOLDING IT 
TO MY FOREHEAD 
AND IMAGINING 
FIRE.
I RECOMMEND THAT 
WE LOOK AT THE BIG 
PICTURE AND VIEW 
IT FROM 20,000 FEET.
DRIFTING.. .FLOATING 
ABOVE THE EARTH... 
WAIT.. .A PLANE IS 
COMING RIGHT AT ME! 
NO0- 0- 0III
WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
MAKE A HUNDRED 
MILLION DOLLARS FOR 
JUST SHOWING UP AT 
WORK?
MY AUDIO LESSONS 
TEACH YOU HOW TO 
BECOME AN UNDER
PERFORMING CEO.
BUT IT CAN BUY 
EXPENSIVE POSSESSIONS 
THAT MAKE OTHER 
PEOPLE ENVIOUS, AND 
THAT FEELS JUST AS 
GOOD.
LUCKILY, I'M AN I.I.T. 
GRADUATE, MENTALLY 
SUPERIOR TO MOST 
PEOPLE ON EARTH,SO I 
FINISHED THE PROTECT 
MYSELF.
DID YOU ORDER THE 
PLASTIC CASINGS I 
NEED?
THEY TAKE 
TWO WEEKS
FOR DELIVERY.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD 
IMAGINE YOU'RE IN 
THE PLANE.
GAAAA! ! I'M 
IN COACH!
BOB, REMEMBER THAT 
MONEY CANT BUY 
HAPPINESS.
AND YOU 
CAN PAY 
TO HAVE 
PEOPLE 
WHACKED. 
I
CAN I 
TRADE MY 
HAPPINESS 
FOR SOME 
MONEY?
SINCE I BECAME 
PROJECT MANAGER,
NO ONE HAS RETURNED 
MY CALLS OR RESPOND
ED TO MY E-MAILS.

The most magnificent minor marvels part one
Some heroes have all the luck. Marvel Comics has a 
stable of first-tier characters known all over the 
globe. Spider-Man, Captain America, the X-Men, 
and the Hulk are just a few of these household 
names. But Marvel also has a large quantity of lesser 
known heroes filling the supporting roles in the 
pages of their popular comics. As a longtime reader, 
Ive become acquainted with some of the most 
intriguing and overlooked minor Marvel heroes.
Most Magnificent Minor Male: The Falcon
Soaring high above the buildings of Harlem, The 
Falcon was introduced early on as Captain Americas 
modern sidekick. In a ridiculous origin thats too 
long for words, Sam Wilson found himself with a 
psychic connection to falcons. The character was 
often used as bait by Caps many evil pursuers, and 
was at one point even revealed to be a pawn of Caps 
most dangerous foe, the Red Skull. Despite the writ
ers who have tried to endlessly complicate Sam 
Wilsons life, the hero endures today in the pages of 
The Avengers.
But Sam Wilson doesnt just fight his battles in the 
air as the Falcon. Sam is also a social worker deeply 
concerned about the people of Harlem. He eventual
ly broke with Captain America and was gifted a high 
profile mini-series in the early 80s. But Sams star 
has never reached the same heights. The Falcon has 
loads of potential in his superhero identity and per
sonal life yet to be touched by Marvels comic cre
ators. Most recently, writer Geoff Johns featured The 
Falcon in a standalone issue of Avengers vol. 3 #64.
Most Magnificent Minor Female: Valkyrie
I have to admit, I dont have a lot of reading experi
ence with Valkyrie. I have, however, found her to be 
one of the finest female fighters since I began read
ing comics. Maybe its her strong personality, or pos
sibly its that skimpy Viking get-up she rocks that 
draws me to her. Either way, the Norse warrior 
known as Brunnhilda is definitely one of comics 
most unique heroes. Furthermore, through some 
simple online research, Ive learned shes one of 
comics few feminist voices.
In Avengers vol. 1 #83, Valkyrie leads a female insur
rection of Earths mightiest heroes. Although the 
spotlight didnt last long, Valkyrie was able to get her 
words in: Male chauvinist pigs ... BEWARE! 
Beware... the VALKYRIE! For one glorious issue, 
Valkyrie and the Lady Liberators kicked butt all over 
town. At the end it was revealed it wasnt really 
Valkyrie after all but The Enchantress, who wanted 
to steal some sort of parallel time device. Whatever. 
Valkyrie or not, shes still hot, and most recently 
fought for the good guys in The Defenders series.
Next week Ill feature part two of the most magnifi
cent minor Marvel heroes: mutant and villain. In the 
meantime, head down to Phantom of the Attic on 
Craig Street, and pick up The Falcon mini-series or 
The Defenders #2 from the back issue boxes of 
comics.
