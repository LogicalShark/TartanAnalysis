INTER-COLLEGIATE FIELD 
MEET.
On Monday afternoon the In
tercollegiate Field Meet, which 
had been postponed from Satur
day on account .of the inclement 
weather, was run off at Friend
ship Oval. The day was fine, but 
the track was not in the best of 
condition, due to the recent heavv 
rains. The jumping pit was al
most entirely filled with water, 
making it very unpleasant for the 
contestants. Tech was fairly 
well represented, as the faculty 
had kindly consented to give us 
a half hoiidav. It is useless to 
say that all availed themselves of 
the opportunit to escape a little 
work, but not all attended the 
meet.
W. & J. had a few rooters who 
did not make themselves heard 
until the last of the events. The 
W. & J. men showed the effects 
of careful training, especially in 
the distance runs.
Dowling was the star for Tech 
and lost the individual cham
pionship of O. Banbury, of W. U. 
P., by the small total of two 
ponts. However, he did good 
work for his school, and we can 
easily let the rest pass. Charles 
showed up in fine form, and took 
the quarter mile easily, and also 
made his opponents hustle in the 
relay race. Griffith, although 
badly crippled by a sore knee, 
managed to land second place for 
Tech in the high jump.
(Continued on page 6.)
EDUCATION AND SELFCONTROL.
The moral responsibility rest
ing upon the educated man is al
ways held to be greater, by the 
mass of humankind, than upon 
the uneducated. His training is 
supposed to fit him peculiarly to 
assume civic burden, because of 
well-balanced judgment, and a 
perfect understanding of the re
sults consequent upon his inabil
ity to carry out public service 
with signal devotion. To such 
casualists there is no distinction 
between education of the mind 
and education of character; the 
two ideas seem synonymous. 
Yet, in the last analysis, was 
there ever, could there possibly 
be, a grosser fallacy? Education 
in self-control, or education in 
characterfor character is es
sentially the result of self-control 
is by no means dependent upon 
a primary integral efficiency of 
either the receptive or reasoning 
processes. It is concerned wholly 
and entirely with will, and will 
may be associated with the last 
degree of ignorance or of stupid
ity. A mans education or lack 
of education is not always re
sponsible for his acts. Stronger 
than any uplift derived from a 
leading out of the mind are nat
ural individual proclivities and 
the degree to which they are in
dulged. Curiously enough, the 
duty of self-control is one of the 
last things learned by the college

EDUCATION AND SELF-CONTROL.
(Continued from page 1.) 
student; and by many who grad
uate in good standing it is never 
learned at all.
The primary impulse to selfcontrol comes most often from 
early childhood environment, es
pecially when this environment is 
that of wholesome religious influ
ence as exerted by parents. The 
kind of sanctity that is merely a 
hollow sphere of goodness, and 
the percussion note of which 
peals out indifference or falsity at 
its center, can seldom or never be 
productive of good on the grow
ing mind of the child, whose psy
chological insight into the deeper 
significance of the lives of his el
ders is scarcely paralleled by any 
oerfection in the art of mental 
science to which his subsequent 
life as a student may lead him. 
Education in self-control, then, 
must be primarily a congenital 
affair, increased and perfected in 
the life of the adult by his recog
nition of the wiser policy of re
straint as affecting his best inter
ests. There need be nothing 
morbid, nothing emotional, noth
ing intellectual about it. More
over, self-control may be mani
festly limited to a restraint over 
a single tendency to excess, or it 
may be normal and complete over 
all wayward tendencies save one, 
and that one be deep-seated and 
seemingly ineradicable.
There is no denying that in 
these days of feverish anxiety for 
riches, the temptations held up 
before the man of influence in 
business are especially strong, 
and many of them are not eth
ically wrong in the beginning, 
but become so ere the unwary 
has had a chance to stop and con
sider. We may rely on the con
stancy (or inconstancy, if you 
please) of human nature, so that, 
in the long run, the result to the 
State or nation is scarcely likely 
to be a permanently damaging 
one. The outlook for business 
integrity and popular honesty is, 
we believe, quite as good as it 
ever was; and duplicity and dis
honesty are not proportionately 
greater than they have always 
been in the history of the world 
as we know it.Harpers.

. CONCRETE.
Are otir structures of armored 
or reinfoced concrete, now so 
popular as a building material 
likely to be permanent? It has 
been assumed hitherto, and no 
facts to the contrary have been 
adduced, that the concrete envel
ope protects the iron rods or bars 
imbedded in it so that there.is no 
danger of rust. Recent experi
ments, however, show that where 
there are electric currents in the 
vicinity corrosion may take place 
within the concrete very quickly. 
The latest tests are those made 
by A. A. Kundson, of New York, 
and reported a few weeks to the 
American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers. The experiments 
were carried out as follows: 
Blocks of one-to-one Portland 
cement sand concrete were mold
ed in a common metal water-pail, 
with a piece of two-inch wrought 
iron pipe placed vertically within 
the blocks to a depth of eight 
inches. When the blocks were 
three years old one of them was 
placed in a tank of sea-water and 
another in a tank of fresh water, 
and direct currents was fed to the 
iron pipes in the center of each 
block, the negative electrode, con
sisting of a piece of sheet iron 
placed in the tank. A third block 
similar to the other two was 
placed in a tank of sea-water, but 
wras not subjected to the electric 
current. After a period of thirty 
days the last named block was 
found to be in perfect condition
and the embedded pipe was per
fectly bright. But the two other 
blocks which had developed
cracks during the test were easily 
broken ooen; yellowish deposits 
were found in the cracks, where 
the concrete had deteriorated to 
such a degree that it could be cut 
easily with a knife, and the pipes 
were considerably corroded, 
showing a loss of weight of over 
two per cent. Similar results 
were obtained in tests with blocks 
of Standard Rosedale cement, 
made in the same mold, although 
in this case the blocks were test
ed thirty days after they had been 
made.
That these results are of pro
found significance is asserted by 
the writer, who is of the opinion 
that they call.for careful investi
gation on the part of concrete en
gineers, and the provision of 
special insulation in all cases 
where embedded steel or reinforc
ing material, is liable to attack by 
stray currents near wet founda
tions. He concludes:
The whole subject of elec
trolysis, which because of the ex
aggerated use to which it has 
been put by a sensational press, 
has not received from technical 
men the attention which it de
serves, should be made the sub
ject of searching investigation 
with a view to determining the 
laws and limits of this form of 
corrosiop.Literary Digest.

INTERCOLLEGIATE FIELD MEET.
(Continued from page 1.)
In the hurdles Dowling, Urling and Dornberger ran easily in 
the trial heats so as to be in good 
condition for the finals.' Buck 
Thomson had the misfortune to 
be pocketed at the beginning of 
the fourth lap in the mile run and 
so did not take a place. Bates 
showed up well in this event con
sidering the lack of training he 
has had, and finished third. In 
the half-mile run Beeken became 
confused on nearing the finish 
line and stopped running just a 
trifle too soon, thus allowinpWilson of W. & J. to finish third. 
His disappointment was great,but 
he ran well and was a good 
ground gainer in the relay race. 
In that event there was some talk 
of penalizing the winner on ac
count of coaching he had on the 
home stretch. Techs relay team 
consisted of Beeken, Bell, Bates 
and Charles, the time was fast 
and Charles had a hard fight in 
his attempt to win.
Techs weak point lies in her 
lack of good men at the weights, 
and thus we lost second place. 
Kohler came within an inch of 
finishing third in the shot-put. 
In the hammer and discus throws 
Zieg, of W. U. P., broke both of 
his former records.

Extracts from A Report on the 
Examinations in English for 
Admission to Harvard 
College.
A question that has puzzled edi
tors for many years is answered, at 
least in part, in A Report on the 
Examinations in English for Admis
sion to Harvard College, now pub
lished by Messrs. C. N. Greenough, 
F. W. C. Hersey, and C. R. Nutter, 
instructors in English at Harvard 
College.
Most of the young men who apply 
for employment as reporters or edi
tors are graduates of colleges or 
universities, and desperate chief 
editors have long torn their scanty 
hair and wondered where and how 
these polished youths have learned 
to maltreat the poor old English 
language so diabolically. Now the 
secret is out.  Prep. school is the 
place.
This, as least, is the conclusion that 
one draws from reading the awful 
messes of words perpetrated by care
fully tutored boys seeking admission 
at Harvard. Ample official warning 
is published that no candidate will 
be accepted in English whose work 
is seriously faulty in spelling, gram---------------------------------------------------

Macbeth was an able general, and 
did not have any traits to kill any 
one.

I like Shakespeare very well, and 
have read most of his Waverley 
Novels.
Indeed! Wasnt it Bacon who wrote 
Sir Walters stories?
Here is rare news:
Addison passed his early life in^the 
place in which he was born. It was 
situated a little way from Harvard 
College on what was then called 
Torys Row. He was educated by a 
private tutor, and, at the age of six
teen, entered Harvard College. He 
had no rooms at the College, but lived 
at his own home. The beauty of the 
country around his place afforded 
him many topics for his books.
Addison was a student-loving boy. 
Now I was enthused by the pleas
ure I found in The Lady of the 
Lake. 
Imagine how severe a blow feels

I have read from several different

The Autocrat was full of fresh 
ideas, and, in the main, little stunts 
of pleasant nonsense.
Although his bad points are 
showed up rather plainly, he has some 
good ones.
His younger brother was kind of

Miss Pfeil is like her pencil 
she has to be lead. Volunteers 
are called for.
Some of us welcomed our last 
holiday while others did not. 
While a few members profited by 
their experience in home mak
ing arts, others, judging by ap
pearances, spent the day in many 
and varied amusements. One' 
young lady might well be taken 
for the athletic girl in the College 
Widow. But this is the price 
every one must pay for canoeing 
with the Ksun beaming in their 
blushing faces. With sighs others 
relate their marvelous feats at 
tennis and basket-ball. But 
speaking of sighs, the most dreary 
of all came from those who with 
flying hair tell their troubles to 
their sisters in misery.
The faculty must have enjoyed 
their vacation immensely and we 
are glad to say were in excellent 
humor after their extra long 
sleep, and we trust that their bub
bling good spirits will continue 
till our next vacation.

THE IDIOSYNCRASY OF 
THE CIGARETTE.
Cigarettes engage the attention 
of American State Legislatures 
so persistently that any fact not 
generally known about them is 
worth imparting. It is often said 
that .they afiford rather a mild 
form of smokiner, and that the to
bacco in them is mere tobacco, 
and mild at that, and incapable 
of such crimes as are charged 
against it. That is true, and 
some of the Western Legislatures 
seem a little crazy about cigar
ettes, which, indeed, do great 
mischief to some children, but are 
not nearly so dangerous to 
grown-ups as western legistors 
seem to think. But cigarettes are 
not mere rolls of tobacco. They 
are not drugged with expensive 
poisons, as is absurdly charged, 
but they have a peculiarity. The 
combination of burning paper and 
tobacco makes a chemical com
pound which is neither tobacco 
smoke nor paper smoke, but has 
a name which chemists know and 
a smell which everybody knows. 
There is not much of the new 
compound, but in what there is 
of it lies the idiosyncrasy of the 
cigarette.Harpers.
