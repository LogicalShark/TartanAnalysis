DRAMA SCHOOL TO PRESENT LA GIOCONDA
Gabriele DAnnunzio, Ital
ian Poet, is Author of 
Tragedy
MATINEE MARCH 27
Characters in Play Are 
Taken From Artistic 
Class
La Gioconda by Gabriele DAn
nunzio is to be presented by the 
Drama Department, with the first 
performance scheduled for Thurs
day night, March 26, at 8:15 oclock 
in the .Little Theater, One of the 
most difficult plays ever to be pro
duced by the Drama Department, it 
is also one of the most interesting 
and unusual, and its many possi
bilities have been utilized -to the 
full by Professor Hickman and his 
aides.
Rain Effects to Be Featured
A special unit set for this play 
has been designed by Mr. Weningcr and Dean Curry, which in
cludes among other features, the 
staging of a real rain storm.
DAnnunzio has set the action of 
the four-act play in modern Flor
ence, Italy. It is  an interesting 
variant of domestic tragedy, as the 
characters belong to the artist class 
rather than to the merchant or 
professional circles which,form the 
background of the usual bourgeois 
tragedy. La Gioconda was writ
ten for Eleanore Duse, the prom
inent Italian actress, who died a 
few years ago in Pittsburgh! and 
is a fine expression of the authors 
love of beauty. One of the main 
tenets of his creed is that we should 
Irink in whatever we can of beauty 
i/ the few hurrying moments of 
^cmorselcss time that arc allotted 
o each of us.
.Author Bccame Known it* War
-DAnnunzio is a contemporary. 
Italian poet, man of letters, and 
soldier, The period from 1908 to 
1921 was the most active in his 
career, not only in.the literary field 
but' also in war and politics. It 
might be said that his realization 
of the necessity for Italy's partici
pation in the war increased his 
literary activity father than de
creased it for lie wrote numerous 
stirring articles addressed to the 
people of his country  on the obli
gation of Italy toward the rest^pf 
Europe. From the moment. Italy 
declared war, DAnnunzio's career 
became one of the extraordinary 
romances of modern times. The 
man hitherto regarded as a sensu
ous aesthete and a decadent, whose 
only claim to distinction was his 
exquisite sense of beauty and his 
mastery of the language, was now 
to prove a man of action, a soldier 
of almost incredible bravery, and 
a politician who, for many months, 
monopolized the attention of the 
world, ..and defied powerful govern
ments. The eloquence of his 
speeches and writings, which gain
edhim his position in Italy, is 
found again in La Gioconda.

Two Carnegie Architects 
Are In Beciux Art Finals
D. R. Jones, graduate student and 
instructor in the Department of 
Architecture at the Carnegie In
stitute of Technology, has been 
selected by competition as one of
a. group of eight architects who 
will enter the final competition for 
the Paris prize, the most important 
scholarship grant awarded in this 
country, according to word received 
here by W. F. Hitchens, head of 
the Department of Architecture. 
Mr. Jones, who graduated from 
Carnegie Tech in 1929, lives in the 
100 block Seventeenth Avenue, 
Homestead.
Another graduate of Carnegie is 
also included among the group of 
eight finalists. He is William. H. 
Schieck who is now at the Uni
versity bf Illinois.
The Paris prize is sponsored by 
the Beaux Arts Architects. It is 
of national extent and carries with 
it. two and a half years of foreign 
study and a money value of $4,000.
The eight finalists have been se
lected after two preliminary com
petitions, and even though only ofte 
of the eight can win the scholar
ship, it is considered a great honor 
to "be included -.amqng the group of 
finalists.
The subject of the competition 
was a museum and laboratory for 
stud and leseaxch in
Where do I get off? Arthur 
Brisbane will answer the question 
for you, says Merle Crowell after 
a recent interview with the famous 
editor. Well, maybe, but were in
clined to skepticism. What would 
he have said about Friday night, 
when Bettys 'mother telephoned a 
cooing little message to the effect 
that Bcttina was awfully ill and 
wouldn't be able to go to the 
Prom? And wed just gotten an 
almost unnecessary liair cut, and 
hired a tux for the evening, not to. 
mention ordering flowers and the 
cab. If Bettina had only been 
thoughtful enough to send over the 
ticket. No, Mr. Brisbane couldnt 
have told us where to get off, for 
we didnt. We .got into bed. 
But, then, we do not wish to ask 
Mr. Brisbane . embarrassing ques
tionsthat one just popped out by 
mistake. On the' contrary, we de
sire, in a spirit of helpfulness, to 
point out to our budding young 
geniuses in wide trousers and lit
tle round black bonnets, some of 
the qualities that help a man to 
demand and receive from his boss 
a salary of $260,000 per year.
Gasps to the right,' gasps to the 
left. You dont believe it? Well,
then, Hie yourself to 'the library 
or the newsstand (the publishers 
would prefer the newsstand) and 
turn to page 63 of the April Amer
ican Magazine. There it is ' in 
black figures on white paper: His 
salary is $260,000 a year. Why? 
For one thing, he has spent the 
last 32 years of his life writing 
editorialsa Today column every 
day, a This Week every week, 
and a full page editorial for every 
Sunday. Easy? Try it once, and 
hand the result to your English 
teacher. Outside of his facility in 
writing, what else helps. Brisbane 
make his $260,000 a year He 
clicked back instantly to the exact 
point in the exact subject we ,were 
discussing. Thats somethng for 
the Plebes to remembernext time 
they write for a history exam.
... . he never hesitated for an 
answer or groped once for 
word. Take a hint from tjjat 
and confront the next prof 3rou 
meet with poise and assurance.
Of course, though, we realize 
that its necessary to know some
thing to say and know how to say 
it if there is to be no hesitation 
as groping for words. Only talk(Contihued on Page Three)

Temporarily Lifted
For the 1931 Easter holiday 
period, the penalty of one count 
for an unexcused absence on 
the day immediately preceding 
or immediately following the 
holiday will be discontinued.
This is being done only as a 
tentative plan. The administra
tion feels that the penalty of a 
count is not a fair punishment 
for the offense. A study will 
be made of the absences of the 
Easter holiday period, and if 
. the plan works successfully, th$ 
penalty of a count will be 
abolished for all holiday pe
riods. On the other hand, if 
absences are encpuraged to any 
great extent, the count will be 
replaced, or some other penalty 
will be administered.

Thistle Staff Desires 
More Freshmen 
Salesmen
All freshmen who wish to become 
Thistle salesmen should report to 
either Raymond Knopf,, business 
manager of the Thistle, or to Mr. 
Davis, at the Y office between
12 and 1:30 oclock tomorrow after
noon.
This is an unusual offer as, previ
ous to this year, students have not 
been permitted to sell Thistles dur
ing their freshman year.
By selling Thistles now, the 
freshmen will have a wonderful 
start toward securing a major posi
tion on tfie yedr-book staff in their 
junior year. A position as Thistle 
salesman, also, entitles the fresh
man to an activitys credit.
In order to secure a copy of the 
Thistle, this year, it is necessary 
to purchase a subscription before 
the books are issued. The number 
of books printed will be thus lim
ited to the number of subscriptions 
sold, therefore eliminating any pos
sibilities of sales after , the books 
are issued.
The subscription price is $5 of 
which only $2.50 need be paid now 
and $2.50 paid when the book is 
received.
Professors Are 
Preparing Slides 
On Architecture
A new bulletin on The Study of 
Architecture is being prepared by 
Professor Keeble, chairman of the 
Faculty of Fine Arts, and Profes

purpose of the lecture is to in
troduce the prospective students to 
the problems that he will have to 
contend with, the qualities a stu
dent should have in order to be 
successful, and to show the advan
tages of an education in a school

DELTA UPSILON WINS 
POSSESSION OF CUP
JIMMY LEONARDS ELECTION to the. captaincy of next years quintette comes without surprise to those who have 
followed him through the past seasoh. Pee Wee was also captain of'the Plebe team of two years ago, so that his leader
ship has received recognition before this year.Jimmy will have the honor of leading the Plaid team into 
battle against several teams which have not graced the Skibo schedule in recent years. Yale and Princeton arc newcomers from the east, while Chicago, a Big Ten quint, will be added 
from the mid-west.,Pee Wee will stack up against one of the most celebrated midgets in the sport world when the Elis come here December 
23 with Albie Booth as their Captain. While the appearance of Yale on the cage card may be somewhat of a novelty, it is by no means the first time the Blue and White has scheduled the 
Tartans. There was a time when Carnegie used to open the Elis football season as a set up, but the Skibos kept improving until in 1922 they held a strong Yale eleven to a 13-0 score 
which resulted in the Bull Dogs looking elsewhere for their 
set ups.

FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON, the jiewly'organized boxing team competed in a match without scoring a point. Last Saturday night the boxers lost to Bucknell at 
Lewisburg by a 7-0 -score.
This match concluded the season's schedule of five meets,and although the Skibos failed to win any, they showed strong
possibilities for a good team next year.The squad worked under the severe handicap of being without reserve material to step in when illness, injuries, and 
ineligibility took the mark of the first stringers,necessitating 
the forfeiture of a number of individual bouts.
Several promising men who should more than balance the 
loss by graduation of Eddie Ashe and Tank Highberger 
will be advanced to the Varsity ranks from the Plebe squad.
* * * * *
.INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL has recently decided
that the annual Greek track meet shall be held early in May, 
rather than in April previous to the opening of the Varsity and Plebe schedules. It was also advocated that a change in the eligibility rules be effected which would eliminate all track
men, whether on the Varsity or Plebe squads, who had scored 
nny points during the season.
Such changes should receive more consideration than was 
evidently given them before being accepted as final. For one 
thing, the meet, if held on a Saturday* as, was recommended, will interfere with school meets which are scheduled to take place in the bowl every Saturday during the month of May except the twenty-third, which immediately precedes examination week. Then too, if all trackmen who have scored any points whatever 
for the school arc barred, the meet will lose in interest and will become a dub affair. It must be remembered that men 
who make a letter one season will be eliminated the next, there by making it impossible for any one fraternity to win consistently through the merits of several Varsity men.'
Recalling that the basketbnll rules were also changed during this past season, it might not be a bad policy for the counril to adopt the practice of changing the rules a year in ad vance so that all talk about discrimination would be eliminated, 
For there will always be someone that feels that the new rulingIs made to keep his team from presenting such a formidable
j ppcarans.c.

BY WINNING SIX out of eight meets this season, the Plebe natators have set a fast pace for I he yearling teams of the 
future. Tho truth of it is that this year's outfit is the best on record. A consistently good performance throughout the entire 
season makes their bid for Varsity berths a welcome one.. Of the nine men scoring points, all made the required nlimber to 
.be awarded numerals. The individual points scored are: Captain Miller 77, Vondcr Lancken Boyer 49, LaChance 34, 
Derdeyn 24, Treat 23, Dennison 22, Thompson 18 and Bright 18.

After having visited the various 
fraternal mansions of Forbes street 
for the past six ycar, the InterMural Swimming Trophy ha* found 
its final resting placc on the mantel
piece at the D. U. house. WJien the 
mist cleared away last Friday the 
score books showed a balancc of 21 
points for the D. Us, 19 for the 
Kappa Sigs, and 16 for. the Betas. 
Otherteams followed in the onedipit column.
The close scores are typical of 
the events that took place. A light
ly swollen entry list of 97, repre
senting IS teams, made it necessary 
to swim two or three heats for 
each race. However, the tide of 
interest was always at a high level 
for the performance of some campus 
notables among the ripples of the 
pool was a fascinating sight to be
hold.
The D. Us and the Kappa Sigs 
emerged from the first four events 
with about equal honors. A fast 
victory in the breast stroke by 
Clinginger put the D. Us in the lead 
which was held to the end.
The meet was not without its 
record-breaking events. In the first 
race the Kappa Sig t relay team 
crossed the finish line with a sub
stantial lead. Their efforts cut two 
and onc-half seconds from a record 
of their own making in 1929. Coulter, 
of the Beta's, splashed through the
25-yard dash in two tenths 1 of 
second better than the record set by 
Williamson in 1929. '
This year is the first time that 
dormitory men have shown an in
terest in the annual swimming gala. 
Skectres, of. Welch Hall, succeeded 
in taking a placc in the. 50-yard 
free style. It is though that more
hidden talent will conic forth next 
year to vie for first place honors.

NIGHT INDUSTRIES SMOKER 
MARCH 28- 
MENS GYM.
NIGHT INDUSTRIES 
TO HOLD SMOKER 
IN GYM ON MARCH 28
Kiltie Band to Play
For the Occasion
Did you ever see anything like it? 
But then, it is just as I expected.
; 'be night students came across again.
' This tjme it is the Arts Ball poster 
contcst. I am glad I didnt try for 
one of those prizes because if I 
had, I am sure Robert Boston wou|d 
not now be the possessor of a 
ticketthe first prize' in the com
petition. Anyhow, congratulations 
Bob and/ may you win more prizes. 
Take it from me your poster was a 
clever piece of work. By this I do 
not mean to minimize the efforts 
of the other contestants in the night 
competition. They certainly showed 
great spirit More power to them. 
From indications it won't be long 
until they hang out the sign S.R.O. 
translated"Standing Room Only 
for the Arts Ball. The tickets are 
being subscribed for in large num
bers. A little advice to the night 
group, better get your first deposit 
made.before they are all sold.
I see by the papersPLAIDthat 
the other two colleges are all going 
up in smoke. One of them is holding 
a. smoker on 21st and the other one 
is held on the 28th. Now wouldnt 
I look nice at a smoker, that is, if 
they are like those you hear about 
I am told you could cut the smoke 
in pieces andthat they would make 
excellent laboratories to test gas 
masks in. Well'-'that may all be true, 
hut over in Arts, if the smoke is 
all that counts, we have smokers 
every night. Sometimes you need a 
gas mask if you expect to get out 
alive. My curiosity is all worked up 
over these smokers, and I am going 
to try some stunt or another so that 
I can obtain admittance to one or 
the other of these smokers.
Now isnt that just like some archeologistgee, Im glad I got that 
word out of my system, to find that 
over in London they bury works of 
aYt under grime and dirt Wonder 
how many -centuries it took to pile 
iip such a quantity ? Bet those angels 
feel like flying now that the load is 
/i;-f;tcd from their wing^. But why go 
to" London to fmd'thirtgs hidden and 
buried under dirt and soot I think 
we in Pittsburgh would make fine 
candidates for first placc in this 
competition. And we wouldnt have 
to go off our Campus, for material. 
Did you ever see such a hodge podge 
assortment of debris as was. strewn 
around the halls the past while back? 
.Looked as if they discovered antiques 
\yhich Noah had in the ark. Chests, 
boxes, cupboards, bed, chairs, stools, 
in fact there wasnt any article that 
you couldnt find. What surprises 
me is where did they keep all this 
stuff, and who used it, and why did
NOTICE TO NIGHT 
INDUSTRIES WORKERS
Preparations are about completed 
for the Night Industries Second 
Semester smoker which will be held 
this Saturday evening, March 28, in 
the auditorium of the mens gym
nasium. The program is all arranged 
and promises to be one that will be 
greatly .enjoyed by everyone.
Again we will have the Kilty Band 
with us. The boys and leaders of 
the band arc always willing to co
operate with other organizations on 
the campus to promote a greater in
terest in student activities. (You will 
recall that at the Industries smoker 
last fall, the band played at the foot
ball game at Cleveland that after
noon and then jumped a fast rattler 
backr to Pittsburgh where a special 
car awaited them so that they could 
play at the smoker that evening.) 
That's the-spiritthat cant be beat 
and the co-operation that counts.
There will several reels of good 
movieswhat titles we cant say, 
but you can count on very good 
comedies.
Other novelty forms of entertain
ment will include a pair of young
sters who know how to force music 
from one of those things which 
folds up like it wasnt muchbut 
the musicwell you have heard it 
before. Dont ask their names now 
for there isn't enough matrices in a 
linotype to spell them out, but they 
will be introduced at the proper 
time. There will also be some other 
forms of amusement offered that 
we dont care to tell you about just 
now. Well hold back a little bit and 
let you enjoy the surprise. Itll be a 
big surprise-r-and how.
For the athletic end of the pro
gram there will be a wrestling match 
and two boxing bouts. The wrestling 
match will be between Jimmy Geyser 
of Industries and another bone 
crusher from the Sewickley Y. M. C. 
A. This bout should be a hummer 
for the Sewickley lad was defeated 
by Geyser in the State championships 
about two years ago and that lick
ing still sticks in his craw. The 
boxers are, well we "aint going to 
tell you because wedont know. But 
we do know this; they have never 
appeared at an Industries smoker 
before so its not those plug-uglies 
that "performed at our last smoker.
The door prizes will _be, as usual, 
some useful articles for one who 
smokes. There will be novelties and 
noise makers galore. Also plenty of
On Saturday afternoon, March 28, 
preparations for the smoker to be 
held in the evening will be made, and 
all those interested in the Work are 
expected to be on hand. Work will 
commence at 2;00 p. m. in the Men's 
Gymnasium.
Arts Ball
During the last several days the 
question has been asked the writer 
what costumc are you going to 
wear at the Arts Ball? The interest 
which has developed is indeed amaz
ing, but nevertheless expected, be
cause an arts ball has,been, some
thing which the night students talked 
about but could not participate in 
very much until this year. Now that 
the ball is an assured thing and 
everybody is going, the question of 
the costumes is uppermost in every
one's mind. A few students have 
given us an inkling as to what they 
will wear, and believe, me there will 
be some surprises coming to the multi
tude. What am I going to wearwell, its just an idea now, and 
that's startling to say the least.
The sale -of tickets has certainly 
been encouraging and now all that re
mains is the coming of April 10 for 
the great event
The committee in charge of the 
Arts Ball has been diligently at 
work and all the details arc about 
taken care of. Take a tip. from one 
who knowsNight Artsthis year's 
Arts Ball is going to be more 
memorable than any thing of the 
past.

ANNUAL MEETING OF 
NU SIGMA ALPHA 
HELD MARCH 14
Nu Sigma Alpha fraternity held 
its regular annual meeting on March 
14 at the Carnegie Inn. The meet
ing was preceded by a dinner. A 
large number of the members were 
present for the occasion.
The election of new officers for 
the coming year took place at this 
timeThe members elected to 
office were: William R. Hodder,
preceptor; James H. Sansonetti, 
mentor; James J. Leindecker, rccordcr; and James S. Geyser, war
den.
Plans were made for a dance to 
be held by the fraternity in the 
Union on April 18. Permission to 
hold the dance has been sccured 
from the Night Student Council.
GENIUS BUDS
TOOTIN PUPPET NOW
Your darn tootin" the Tootin 
number of Puppet will be out on 
sale Monday evening, March 30. 
This will be a real sensation, so 
get your copies early from the 
night salesmen. Dont be surprised 
if they arc all sold out. A sugges
tion would be to order a copy in 
advancc from your salesman.

without them, Im asking you?
Last on the program will be what? 
You guessed itl Sure! EATS1 And 
how 1 When that Industries gang put 
on a smoker they do everything in 
a big way, but they seem to handle 
the food end of it in the biggest 
way. Exactly what victuals will be 
served to you, we are not prepared 
to say, but rest assured that there 
will be plenty o:f everything.
Remember, this Saturday evening 
at the gym, 7:30 p. m. Admission 
free to Night Industries students 
only, who have a ticket and their 
registration card. Tickets arc being 
distributed through the corridors of 
Industries this week.
Just a word of warning. Many of 
the students who will be at the 
smoker drive cars. Please observe 
all parking rules as published in the 
Plaid and in your handbook for they 
are enforced on Saturday evenings as 
well as other nights of the week.

OUT IN THE COLD
The staid and dignified Public 
Library, New York City, is being 
torn and shaken by internal dis
putes, and the famous stone lions 
wish themselves with their flcslland-blood brethcrn in the more 
quiet confines of Central Parle.
The dissensions alluded to were 
caused by a new ruling, which, 
oddly enough, bars all high school 
and collegc students from the 
reference rooms. Too crowdod 
is the excuse. While the writer 
has never had the opportunity to 
keep this special library under sur
veillance, if the New Yorkers arc 
much like other humans, there is 
probably more need of excluding 
t|ic usual collection of bums that 
infest all such public places.
The librarians claim to be able 
to distinguish a collegc man at a 
glance, so they shouldnt have a 
hard time in developing their 
eagles eyes to the point of detec
tion of loafers. The reference 
rooms, hereafter, are, according to 
the ruljng, to be reserved for real 
scholars, and while this remark 
is not only disparaging to some 
students, but downright insulting 
to many of them, it is to be hoped 
that a graceful gesture in the part 
of the authorities will keep Walker, 
Doolittle and their associates out, 
too.

IN MEMORIUM
Word has just been received by 
tho Plaid that Louis M. Campbell, 
a night student in the Electrical 
Engineering. Department of the 
Night College of Engineering, died 
on February 25. He had been a 
former student of M. I. T., but 
left Cambridge, Mass., to accept a 
position with the Wcstinghousc in
terests at East Pittsburgh and at
tended classes at Carnegie. Had he 
lived he would have completed his 
coursc this June when lie would 
have\carncd a Bachelor of Science 
degree.
We wish to extend our sympathy 
to the members of his family in 
their recent loss.

Cigarette!
T
HE whole country is talking about the throateasy mildness and the prime freshness of Camel 
Cigarettes in the new Humidor Pack.
The above chart prepared by the Pittsburgh Testing 
Laboratory tells you why.
Please examine it carefully. It is an unfailing guide 
to cigarette selection and enjoyment. .
As you can quickly see by the three upper curves on 
this interesting chart, cigarettes that lack the protec
tion of the Humidor Pack lose their moisture rapidly 
from the day they are manufactured.
And day by day as this moisture disappears, the 
smoke from these cigarettes becomes harsher, liotler, 
more unkind to the smokers throat.
Not so with Camels!
The Humidor Pack is moisture proof and sealed air
tight at every point. It protects the rich, flavorful
aroma of the choice Turkish and Domestic tobaccos 
of which Camels are blended.

It is so easy to tell the difference between parched dry 
cigarettes and fresh prime Camels that it is no wonder 
everybody is reaching for a frenh cigarette today.
Your fingers identify stale, dried-out tobaccos at once. 
While a Camel is flexible and pliant.
Your ears can tell the difference too. For a dust-dry 
cigarette crackles under pressure.
But the real test is taste and there is simply no com
parison between the rich mildness of a Camel and the 
hot, brackish smoke from a stale, dry cigarette.
Switch to Camels just for today then leave them 
tomorrow if you can.

Tartan Platform
More and better equipped club-rooms.
Better seating accommodations for students at athletic events.
More interest in student activities.Faculty co-operation in regard to three hour exam limit.
An increase in the activities fee or a re-apportionment of 
the present fee to aid student publications.
Co-operation
For the first time since its existence, the Tartan is publishing a definitely outlined platform which* we believe, will re-act 
to the best interests of the school if sufficiently followed by the proper authorities. We realize that most of the items 
listed above cannot be taken care of immediately, but if any forward action whatsoever is taken this semester we will feel 
compensated for our endeavor to improve the conditions of student life at Carnegie.
.The combined efforts of Student Council, the Administra
tion, and the Athletic Association will be necessary to remedy the present conditions and the Tartan hopes they will act immediately and effectively. Lets drop the lethargy and take a 
'stride forward.
Count System
President Baker's recent announcement that the count system will be abolished for the approaching Easter holidays is 
a very welcome one. It is a step toward modernization and a realization that college students arc fully able to govern themselves and do. not need to be bound by a group of regula
tions such as arc in vogue at preparatory school.It is often necessary for a student to leave classes an hour 
or two early in order to make proper train connections and he should be allowed the privilege of deciding whether or not he can fi/Tord to miss class. The new system may be abused by 
some, but it is the individuals problem and his loss if he cuts' too many classes.
. One of the principal reasons for sending people to college 
is to give them an opportunity to think for themselves. Fewer 
childish regulations is the best way to accomplish this purpose.

new laboratory in the basement of' 
Engineering hall. Through the in
terest and co-operation of Mr. 
Orbin this laboratory has been re
modeled and rebuilt. Together 
with the new coal research labo
ratory and the materials testing 
laboratory, it is a credit to Car
negie.
Dr. V. N. Krivobok, head of the 
department, announces that the'.students of advanced standing include 
four men from the United States 
Navy and two from Norway and 
Italy. They are working on prob
lems of various natures, some deal
ing with corrosion of metals and 
some with strength of metals at 
elevated temperatures. The amount 
of graduate work being done is 
very creditable, as the department 
advertises little or not at all for 
graduate students.

HtAvdy, Yo* All!
If that Grande Marche has un
tangled itself yet, the Womens J. P. 
is over for another year. Helen 
Prosser made a left turn instcid of 
a right turn and led the following 
couples into a, spiral that ended up 
with her in the middle and no way 
out except up. The line was forccd 
to unwind in order to get anywhere. 
All the while Dofi Bcstors boys 
played Ninety-Nine Out Of A 
Hundred and we hope it wasnt a 
wise-crack.
They tell us all wen I well Friday 
night, except for the absence of the 
grape-fruit from the dinner. Perhaps 
the committee wanted to protect Don 
Bcstors black and blue tux in case 
he should play "Give Me Something 
To Remember You. By." Don's crown
ing achievement of the evening was 
his announcement that "The second 
contingent of the groceries is now 
being served, at the close of the 
first meal. He didnt play "The Pea
nut Vender," cither, assuring his suc
cess.
The dance was properly called the 
Junior "Promenade" because most of 
the time was spent walking from 
here to there, talking to Dean Green, 
and eating. A small part of the 
time was devoted to dancing. Mortar 
Board held their usual party pre
ceding the dance and then ate again 
at the regular dinner. Avoid that 
future shadow 1
Saturday was the first day of 
Spring, according to those who 
know. Sch.enley Park is open to ap
plicants from now until the end of 
school. The tops may officially come 
down on the roadsters, and hats may 
be discarded. The, Senior Fence is 
open for occupation from 11:30 
until 1:30 every day for the coming 
season. Roller skates may be rented 
from some of the dorm boys upon 
sufficient notice. The. architects will 
lend their kites to those wishing 
such a pastime. The kites cant he 
rented because the inexperienced 
architects rent most of, ..them last 
year.
Doc Baker officially recognized the 
advent of spring last week with his 
announcement of the .abolittan of 
counts for inexcused absences be
fore and after the Easter vacation. 
We hope there will be enough stu
dents in school April 7 to outnum
ber the faculty, at least.
Washington and Jefferson students 
insist that cither their athletes will 
be taken care of, and they will be 
allowed to wear corduroys and hob
nails, or else their President will 
preside over a flock of empty class
rooms and half a faculty. At this 
sitting they arc still out of school 
after their official walk-out last 
week. All we can say is, we admire 
their spirit, but what a high-priced 
vacation!
The combined Glee Clubs arc of
fering a free concert and not-so-frcc 
dance  Friday night. The far-famed 
new Slcibo Song will no doubt he 
featured at ifoth affairs. A personal 
appearance of the author, that bloom
in Hcnglishman Freddie Lathain, is 
expected by the more optimistic. It 
is hoped that a large number will 
attend the dance in order that the 
Glee Clubs may buy some more sheet 
music.

Ritters Turn in Best 
Telegraphic Score 
of Year
Last week the Tartan riflers, evi
dently suffering no ill effects from 
the Navy trip, turned in their best 
score of the year in telegraphic 
competition, hitting the targets for 
a total of 1857. However, this was 
just five points below the mark 
needed to capture first place, be
cause a strong University of Ken
tucky team turned in a score of 
1862. Western Maryland took third 
with a good 1850, and Gettysburg 
trailed with 1803. The University 
of Pennsylvania failed to report a 
score.
This week the team will con
clude its telegraphic schedule with 
one of the hardest groups of op
ponents to be encountered this 
year. The opposition will consist 
of Cincinnati, Nebraska, Columbia, 
Kansas, Georgia Tech, and David
son.
The big event on the weeks 
program, though, will be the an
nual national N. R. A. intercollegi
ate shoulder-to-shoulder tournament 
to be held, at Morgantown this 
Saturday. The team will leave on 
Friday afternoon and expects to 
return Sunday morning. Strong 
competition from all parts of the 
country will be encountered, but 
Carnegie is expected to make it 
tough for them all.
In a special three position tele
graphic meet last week, Carnegie 
defeated the University of Mary
land, 1380 to 1365. This is an 
exceptionally good score, and if 
such a performance had been turn
ed. in against Navy, the result
might have been different.

Faculty To Give 
Play At Annual 
Party March 28
The annual faculty party spon
sored jointly by the Carnegie 
Womens club and the General 
Faculty organization will be held 
in the Union on Saturday, March 
28. As in previous years an en
tertaining program has been ar
ranged and a large crowd is ex
pected.
The feature of the party will 
be the presentation of Stephen 
Leacocks humorous melodrama, 
Cast Up By the Sea. The char
acters in the play will be por
trayed by faculty members, but 
their identity is being kept secret 
and will be one of the suprises of 
the evening.
A part of the evening will be 
given over to cards and dancing. 
Door prizes also will be presented.
According to Miss Mary Wat
son Green, Dean of Women, this 
is the one social event of the ycar 
which all the faculty look forward 
to with enthusiasm. As it is to be 
the only all faculty party this 
year, no efforts are being spared 
to make it a success.
Mrs. Thomas D. Mylrea is chair
man of the committee in charge of 
.the event. Mrs. Walter F. Rittman is president of the Carnegie 
Womens club, and Prof. Harry 
S. Hower is president of the 
general facult3r.
SENIORS MAY ORDER 
DEGREE RINGS NOW
Degree rings should be ordered 
as soon as possible by prospective 
graduates, according to the request 
coming from the Alumni office 
where samples of rings arc now 
on display in the Gymnasium and 
Room 206. A deposit of $4 must 
be made on all orders. .
The rings arc made,in two sizes: 
mans ring at ?16, and the womans 
ring at $14. When a $4 deposit is 
made the ring is ordered, but held 
at the factory until the day of 
graduation, at which time the. ring 
is. mailed to the graduate with the 
remainder of the charges* C. O. D. 
This enables those who wish to 
pay only the deposit to have their 
rings about a week after gradua
tion.
. .Rings mayalso be paid for in 
full at the time of ordering. In 
this case they arc sent at oncc to 
the Alumni office, where they arc 
held until the day  before gradua
tion.
Students who clo not wish to 
order their rings before graduation 
may do so at any time afterward 
by communicating with the Alumni 
office.
Dr. Ross Continues Dis
cussions of Governmental 
Stabilization of Prices
The same stabilization game has 
been tried in copper to the grief 
of many an honest investor. The 
Copper Exporters Incorporated 
stabilized -the price at 18 cents 
during the year ending March, 1930. 
After this date the self-destructive 
forces that1 stabilization calls into 
action cut the price in half.
Chadbournc Agreement Arises
Sugar has been a more recent 
subjcct for the schemes of stabi
lizers. In February seven nations 
controling only 45 per cent of the 
worlds crop entered into the Cliad.bournc agreement to restrict ex
ports. Judging from the experi
ence in rubber, coffcc, and copper, 
only the greatest optimist can cxpect anything more than a small 
and temporary benefit from sugar 
stabilization.
Such stabilization projects obvi
ously are not remedies or cures for 
sick industries. Indeed to call

THE PUBLIC NUISANCE
What Little Girls Think of Little 
Boys
When the Public Nuisance show
ed his last column"Feminine Edu
cation a'Flop?? to several campus 
queens, they shouted:
Huh. Let us talk. You dont 
dare. Why shouldnt we be dis
satisfied with the average man! 
Huh. .
 So the Public Nuisance opened 
wide his columns and said:
O.K. Tell us what you think 
of the average college man.
Well, honi soil qui mal y pense. 
Thcy/re all flops.
Men are all wet smacks.
. Men are conceited asses. Thcy;rc 
negligible intellectually..
There was much more, and much 
stronger, and some, as the tabloids 
quaintly say, Daring, frank, un
printable revelations, but a hur-< 
ried summary of these four-charm
ing young ladies opinions is print
ed here.
Omitting sex, in this discussion, 
since all the Amazons,' even the 
most fiery, admitted that Man Avas 
at least a biological "necessity, or 
at least biologically satisfying, \men 
were absolutely negative quantities.
First of all, men couldnt talk. 
They didn't know anything about 
.anything. The acme of musical 
conversation, except for the music 
student, was represented by a 
knowledge of the latest Victor, 
Brunswick, r Hit-of-the-Weck rec
ords. Air. Lopez or Lombardo 
was known; Mr. Stokowski or 
Gabrilowitch were unknowns. Art 
John Held, Jr., with perhaps Max 
Parrish as a high level, completed 
took the field, from M. Picasso. 
The theaterexcept for the re
views and musical comedies was 
non-existent;- Strictly" Dishonor
able, was known because there was 
a dirty line in. it. The efforts of 
Mr. ONeill and the Theater Guild 
were relatively unheard of. Books 
the boys never read anything; a 
girl would always have a book with 
herboys read the newspapers.
Magazines  masculine standards 
rose to a high with Saturday Eve
ning Post and Colliers, while a 
surprisingly large average read the 
detective, air-war, and western pulp 
stories. So you see, men were
intellectuallyblah!
When a man went out, the only 
thing he could talk about was him
self. Some got deep and discussed 
mutual friends. But what man
could ever hope to plumb the
secret motives of a mutual girl
friend with the same depth, ac
curacy, and intuition as the aver
age sorority sister.
Men were not stimulating; it was 
an effort to be with most of them. 
The only reason one went was be
cause despicable as their company 
might be, it was all sorts of hell 
to sit alone in a dormitory of 
nights and Watch the other girls
prance outeven, to waiting morons. 
Ones pride demanded datesbut 
the  actual date was nothing. It 
was the thrill of the scalps hung 
up, and not the thrill of the chase 
itself' that counted. (The Public 
Nuisance feels that with men it is 
tli2 chase that counts and the vic
tory is merely a passing by
product).
Oh, there was a lot more, but 
the gist of it is above. When I 
asked about politicsfraternity or 
nationalthe maidens. admitted ig
norance, but said they could talk 
the boys deaf, dumb, and blind, 
because the boys didnt really 
know anything either. Religion 
nobody, talked' religion any more, 
so. they did not know how the men 
stood. Sex was the big topic of 
conversation, but on straight theory, 
any girl after six months in a 
sorority house could out-talk the 
most -sophis'ticated  of collegiate roues. , -. .. .........
So there we are,, and; if it-weren't 
for that saving grace of biological 
necessity, the 'PublicNuisance is' 
afraid we boys would have to 
commence getting cultured.
them poor palliatives is to exag
gerate their usefulness.
One of the strongest forces con
flicting with the success of stabi
lization is the international move
ment of capital. This has grown 
so rapidly since the nineteenth 
century that it is almost a new 
economic phenomenon. For ex
ample, while the British Govern
ment was restricting production of 
rubber in the British colonies and 
thereby raising prices, British ca
pital sought investment in Dutch 
rubber plantations and defeated, 
stabilization.
When American copper producers 
tried to stabilize the price of coppcr, American and British capital 
seeking profitable investment poured 
into Canada and Africa to develop 
sdmc of the richest copper mines 
in the world. In the latter part 
of 1931 the Rhodesian mines are 
expected to be able to deliver the 
metal at eight cents per pound in 
London or New York.
Monoply Price Factors Undermine
Substitution, alterations in de
mand, development of new produc
tion, the appearance of invisible 
stocks and' many other monoply 
price factors undermine the effec
tiveness of stabilization and upset 
the best laid schemes of stabilizers.

If stabilization is not economic
ally sound one. may naturally, ask 
for an' explanation of the Farm. 
Boards effort to stabilize the price 
ofwheat. Politics, not economics 
is the answer.
Contented farmers give Repub
lican votes. Wheat prices and Re
publican majorities rise and fall 
together. The success of the Farm 
Board depends not upon its ccontpmic wisdom, but upon. its ability 
to stabilize the western , wing . of 
the Republican Party. 
With a fivc-bijlionrbushcl world 
wheat crop in. 1930, as compared 
with the average three and a halfbillion-bushcl crop for preceding 
years and with Australian produc
tion doubled, the Farm Board; wjll 
have to briiig off, a miracle or 
spend hundreds. of millions to
temporarily stabilize wheat, hold 
the wheat farmers in line, and 
bring the Party of Prosperity and 
Economy home triumphant in 1932.

BOLTS
8 times as strong under super
heat as "before the war"
Trace the evolution of the bolt since 1913 
and you trace the amazing post war advance of 
power and industrial processes . .. and the 
Crane contribution to help make it possible.
In carefree days before the war, a steel 
bolt was a steer bolt. It was made of any 
easily obtained steel that forged easily and 
took threads well. Industry moved forward '
... stronger bolts were asked for. Ordinary 
steels were improved to tensile strength of 
45TTT pounds. Not enough. A bolt with 
forged-on head and tensile strength of
50.000 pounds was developed. Still not 
enough. Cold rolled steel bolts with tensile 
strength of 80,000 pounds were offered.
They had a tendency to snap.
To fully meet the demands of modern high 
pressure and temperature technology, Crane 
Co. brought out for its cast and forged steel 
materials their Triplex steel stud bolts, of 
chrome nickel steel with tensile strength of
125.000 pounds. The limit is not yet. Even 
now, Crane Co. can supply bolts for valve 
bonnets and flanges with tensile strength of
140.000 pounds and retaining strength at 
well past 1000o F.
By exhaustive laboratory investigations, long 
carefully charted creep tests, detailed study 
of service conditions, Crane metallurgists 
have helped this development. With the 
same scientific methods they have as strik
ingly improved bodies, bonnets, discs and 
seats, stems, packing boxes ... so that Crane 
valves and fittings can be supplied for higher 
pressures and temperatures than have yet 
been commercially projected.
