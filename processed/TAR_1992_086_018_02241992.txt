Referendum inconclusive: 
Senate upholds resolution
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Asst. News Editor 
& GREG LEVRAULT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
At their meetingTuesday, Student Stu
dent decided 15-111 to uphold the Reso
lution Against Discrimination by ROTC 
at CMU, in spite of the 714-629 referen
dum vote to rescind the resolution.
Accordingto Senate Chair Chris Neigh
bor, the referendum results were so close 
that Senate could not act on them. The 
referendum results were not conclusive 
enough, said Neighbor.
Student Senate, with the assistance of 
statistics professor David Banks, deter
mined that the results of the referendum 
actually overlapped. Approximately 47 
percent of the votes were in favor of the 
resolution, while 53 percent were in favor 
of rescinding the resolution. These fig
ures are so close to the margin of error, 
that the two figures overlap. Its so close 
that it should be considered as a tie, said 
Neighbor.
Senates decision to uphold the resolu
tion in spite of the referendum results 
has brought some criticism from the stu
dent body. CIT freshman Anne.Dalpliaz 
said, Wasnt the majority of votes for 
keeping ROTC on campus? And Student
Senate-decided to keep the resolution.... 
They should act by majority rule. 
Neighbor believes that if the results 
were more one sided, Senate would have 
taken different action on them. According 
to Neighbor, if 70 to 80 percent of the 
campus voted, and 50 percent of those 
people voted against the resolution, that 
would be a very clear message.
I dont think you can look at the overall 
numbers and say something conclusively, 
said Neighbor. He believes that the college 
numbers give a better representation of 
the student opinions, noting the percent
ages of people who voted from each college 
and their opinion.
Over 1300 students, or 22.7 percent of 
the campus voted in Mondays referen
dum. This presented Student Senate with 
a rare problem  lines. A lot of people 
didnt vote because they didnt have enough 
time, said IM senior Jim Irwin, I think 
they fucked up bad by setting up one 
voting place and one set of polls.... A lot of 
people saw they were going to have to wait 
fifteen to thirty minutes in line to vote, 
[and] they werent going to do it. 
Neighbor agreed that the lines were a 
problem, but said that with the resources 
Senate had, it would have been difficult to 
accomodate more voters and insure that

By NATHAN FULLERTON
Tartan News Editor
Graduate students concerns about 
funding will be one of the main top
ics of discussion at this Wednesdays 
meeting of the Provosts Graduate 
Advisory Board. Approximately 20 
CMU graduate students lost their 
funding last December for non-academic reasons.
Its assumed that when you get 
accepted into a graduate program 
that you are going to be financially 
supported, said Lara Wolfson, GSO 
Liason Officer to the Graduate Ad
visory Board. Apparently CMU ac
cepted more graduates than they 
could fund.
The board, established only last 
semester, has made the issue of fund
ing guarantees one of its top priori
ties. The way research financing is 
going, a lot of outside funding may 
stop. Theres a real danger [to gradu
ate students] in departments that 
get most of their funding from the 
outside.
Specific funding issues the board 
wants to discuss are funding guar
antees, an emergency fund for mini
mum stipends, and protection
mechanisms for addressing griev
ances such as an appeals board or an 
official grievance committee.
Associate Provost for Academic 
Projects Barbara Lazarus, who has 
been working with the committee, 
describes it as a valuable new ve
hicle for working with the provost.... 
Theyre a great groupterribly help
ful. [The Committee] allows them to 
tell you things that are on their minds 
 things that are important.
In addition to funding, the Gradu
ate Advisory Board plans to address 
other issues, including the use of Uni
versity facilities by spouses, teaching
skills for graduate students, daycare, 
housing, and parking. The Graduate 
Advisory Board also plans to address 
an upgrade of Health Services and the 
prospect of creating a dean of gradu
ate studies.
A dean of graduate studies is one of 
the key issues that the Advisory Board 
is pushing for. Its because we dont 
have one that things like this loss of 
funding occur, said Wolfson. But the 
administration is somewhat reluctant 
to centralize the responsibility for the 
graduate students, which has tradi
tionally been the territory of the indi
vidual departments.
Referendum 
draws 22.7%
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan Copy Manager
Last Mondays referendum marked one of the 
highest voter turnouts that Carnegie Mellon has 
ever seen. Almost 23 percent of campus cast 
ballots to tell Student Senate whether students 
wanted the Resolution Against Discrimination 
by ROTC at CMU rescinded or not.
The results were very close with 629 people 
voting in favor of keeping the resolution, 714 
voting to rescind the resolution, and 19 people 
abstaining.
Its the highest [turnout] in recent history, 
said Student Senate Chair Chris Neighbor. Its 
been a long time since weve had 20 percent. 
CIT Senator Greg Haverkamp was happy with 
the high number of students voting in his college 
and in general. I was pleased overall with the 
turnout especially with the limitations of people 
going through [the line].
On the other hand, Michael Loomis, GSIA 
Senator, attributed the low turnout from his 
college to the feeling that a lot of graduate 
students arent very involved in campus. How
ever, Loomis said, Twenty one percent [overall] 
is a humongous turnout and shows there was a 
lot of concern and interest.
Erik Larson, CFA Senator, said, I was pleased 
and a little surprised [at the turnout], but it 
wasnt overwhelming. The two sides turned out, 
but the middle ground wasnt represented. 
Larson also said, It wasnt much of a sample 
considering the bias.
The high voter turnout can be attributed to a 
number ofthings. Accordingto Haverkamp, there 
were two main reasons, a lot of people had a lot 
of interest in this issue and it was well adver
tised and well run.
Neighbor said, I attribute the high turnout to 
clear weather and the location. Spring elections 
always go better. The location in front of the 
Fence was excellent.
The controversy surrounding the resolution 
and the referendum also contributed to the high 
turnout. According to Linda Lombardi, a fresh
man in H&SS, I voted because I didnt want to 
see ROTC kicked off campus  I know a lot of 
people who can only be here because of ROTC, 
but I dont agree with the discrimination policy. 
As Neighbor said, Controversy always makes 
for a good election.

Senate launches task forces
By BRENDAN McFEELY
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Student Senate announced the 
formation of three new subcom
mittees under the authority of 
the Campus Affairs Committee 
at last Tuesday nights meeting.
These subcommittees will 
cover a range of topics, with one 
addressing environmental is
sues on campus, another cover
ing Carnegie Mellon Dining Ser
vice issues, and a third which 
will be dedicated to research and 
documentation of problems aris
ing from Physical Plant.
The Environmental Task 
Force will be spearheaded by 
H&SS Senator Josh Knauer. 
Knauers stated main goals in
clude the improvement of the 
campus recycling program, the
reduction in the amount of pa
per waste produced by the cam
pus community, and the educa
tion of the community about is
sues integral to the environment. 
Particularly, Knauer hopes to 
encourage means of mass com
munication with students other 
than the currently popular mass 
mailings. Also, says Knauer, We 
hope to have recycling bins on 
every hall in every dorm, in 
order to improve not only can 
recycling, but also paper, plas
tic, and glass recycling.
The CMDS Task Force will be 
chaired by H&SS Senator Amy 
Potthast. CIT Senator Matt 
Shevach, a member of the com
mittee, outlined their plans. 
Were working on bringing out
side vendors onto campus to 
serve food, said Shevach, who
also said that the committee, 
which is working with both 
CMDS and the SDC Food Com
mittee, hopes to bring some sort 
of outside chain, probably aTaco 
Bell, into the area now occupied 
by Morewood Cafeteria. The 
Task Force will also be attempt
ing to help CMDS improve the 
quality of the vegetarian meals 
available in Dining Service es
tablishments.
The Physical Plant subcom
mittee will be chaired by IM 
Senator Matt Woodhead. The 
subcommittee members were 
unable to comment at this time. 
But Woodhead said that he 
plans to rev things up [this] 
week.

Bush edges Buchanan inSenate 
expands 
grant 
eligibility
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (AP) 
The Senate passed, 93-1, a $57 
billion, five-year higher educa
tion package that markedly ex
pands financial aid to college stu
dents from lowerand middleincome families.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (DMass.), called the measure a 
home run for middle-income fami
lies.
The renewal of the Higher Edu
cation Act,would extend Pell 
grant eligibility to students from 
families with incomes of $42,000 
or below and would eliminate con
sideration of home and farm eq
uity in determining the income 
qualification. The limit now is 
about $30,000 and counts such 
equity.
Kennedy estimated that the 
change would make Pell grants 
available to an addition 600,000 
students. About 3.6 million now 
qualify for the direct assistance, 
designed to augment guaranteed 
student loans.
The size ofthe Pell grants would 
increase to $3,600 in 1993 from 
the current $2,400 and would rise 
to $4,800 in 1997. A total of $8.4 
billion would be spent on the pro
gram next year.
The lone dissenter was Repub
lican Jesse Helms of North Caro
lina, who assailed the programs 
cost.
Another key feature of the leg
islation demands that schools 
with loan payback default rates 
exceeding 25 percent be dropped 
from the program. Meanwhile, 
theloan application system would 
be simplified.
The Senate yesterday dropped 
a proposal to change the program 
from one that receives annual 
federal appropriations to an en
titlement program  meaning 
its funding would be virtually au
tomatic. President Bush threat
ened to veto any bill that con
tained the entitlement measure.

Navy tightens 
harassment policy
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (AP)  
The Navy, hoping to shake a reputa
tion for tolerating sexual harass
ment, said first-time Navy or Ma
rine Corps violators of certain anti
harassment rules will automatically 
be kicked out of the service.
The Navy has been rocked in re
cent years by a series of highly pub
licized incidents of sexual harass
ment and abuse.
Last November an admiral was 
fired from a prestigious job after he 
failed to act promptly on a complaint 
by a female aide that she was sexu
ally harassed at a Las Vegas con
vention of naval aviators.
In 1989 a female midshipman at 
the U.S. Naval Academy was chained 
to a urinal and photographed by 
male midshipmen.
In an all-hands message trans
mitted on Tuesday, Adm. Frank B. 
Kelso II, chief of naval operations,
said the tighter behavior standard 
would take effect March 1. The Navy 
made the message available to the 
news media today.
The new Navy policy states that 
members of the Navy and Marine 
Corps will be fired outright on the 
first substantiated incident of cir
cumstances including: threats or 
attempts to influence anothers ca
reer or job to obtain sexual favors; 
offering rewards in exchange for 
sexual favors; and physical contact 
of a sexual nature which, if charged 
as a violation of the Uniform Code of 
Military Justice, could result in pu
nitive discharge.
Until now, these violations car
ried a penalty of possible discharge; 
now the punishment is mandatory, 
a Navy spokeswoman said.

gal right to contest his or her dis
missal.

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Drama Department delivers tickets
The Drama Department recently began a delivery service for 
tickets purchased through the CFA box office. For a small fee, 
patrons can now buy tickets on a major credit card and have them 
delivered to their home or business by Wheel Deliver, a company 
that also delivers take-out meals from selected restaurants. Deliv
ery charges range from $3.25 to $4.25, depending on location.
Student Senate sets election date
Student Senate has approved Wednesday, March 18, as the date 
for its spring elections. Petitions for seats in each college as well as 
for Student Government President and Student Government Trea
surer are now available at the Skibo Information Desk.
Each petition includes a copy of the newly adopted election rules 
and poster policy. All candidates are expected to read them. The 
deadline for returning the petitions to the Student Senate box at the 
Information Desk is Wednesday, March 4.
Trost resigns GSO presidency
Jennifer Trost performed her last official act as the president of 
the Graduate Student Organization with the opening ofthe Gradu
ate Coffeehouse. Trost officially resigned two weeks ago, leaving 
the position of president of GSO vacant.
Trost was honored at the Coffeehouses opening in a speech by 
statistics graduate student Lara Wolfson, As president of GSO,
guel a9 pam2 PCMbelmb xMlbesa8lp
she has brought a wave of change for the better. Her inspired 
leadership has made [the Coffeehouse] and many other events 
possible.... Although we are sad to see her go, we congratulate her 
on a job well done.
Information kiosks revamped
The Information Centers (computer kiosks) located throughout 
the campus have been enhanced with a number of new features as 
the result of a survey distributed last fall. The new systems haye 
been thoroughly tested and debugged to avoid some of the system 
failures they have experienced in the past. In addition, the software 
has been enhanced with sophisticated self-monitoring capabilities, 
which tally the number of users for evaluation purposes.
Users of the new Information Centers can now touch the com
puter screen to find out about available campus facilities, look 
through a travellers directory, or take a visual tour through 
Carnegie Mellons history from 1900 to the present. The original 
Calendar of Events, Campus Map, Campus Directory, and Univer
sity News are also available.
The Information Centers are currently located in Skibo, Warner 
Hall, Hunt Library, and Morewood Gardens. Future locations such 
as Baker Hall, Wean Hall, and Resnik House/West Wing are being 
considered.
City approves false alarm fines
The City of Pittsburgh has approved legislation establishing
penalties for multiple false fire and burglar alarms. Starting 
January 1,1992, the city began assessing substantial charges for 
commercial false fire alarms. Property owners will not be charged 
for the first three false alarms annually, but beginning with the 
fourth false alarm, the penalty will be $500 per alarm.
SURG applications being accepted
Small Undergraduate Research Grants (SURG) are being 
awarded again this year. Undergraduates in good academic stand
ing from all departments are eligible to apply. Grants are based on 
the number of proposals and are usually in the amount of $500.
Students in information networking or international marketing 
are highly encouraged to apply because SURG has received much 
support for this type of research from the Information Networking 
Institute and the Carnegie Bosch Institute. In addition, special 
funds are available for women and minorities in science and 
engineering.
Wholey receives two-year grant
Associate professor of social and decision sciences Douglas Wholey 
recently received a two-year grant totaling more than $170,000 
from the Health Care Financing Administration. Professor Wholey 
will investigate HMO costs and pricing from 1988-91.

Academic Computing and 
Media (AC&M) are considering 
the future of the Mudge and 
Morewood computer clusters. In 
conjunction with the newly 
formed Academic Computing 
and Media Student Advisory 
Council, AC&M has begun an 
investigation into the cost-effec
tiveness of these clusters as com
pared to larger, better-staffed 
clusters on campus.
According to Chris Thyberg, 
headofDistributed Workstation 
Services, the concerns about
these clusters center around the 
number of students they serve, 
the quality of services they pro
vide, and the cost of mainte
nance and upgrades.
Freeing resources currently 
committed to Mudge and More
wood would be part of a process 
of continued improvements to 
other clusters arid the develop
ment of new services and facili
ties, Thyberg said.
We are particularly concerned 
that students make informed 
decisions during housing draw, 
said Thyberg. You should 
choose a room in either Mudge 
or Morewood knowing that it is
a possibility that their clusters 
may close during the summer. 
Chair of the AC&M Student 
Advisory Council Eleni Morris 
stresses that the decision has 
not yet been made, We want 
the students to resp ond to this.... 
We want to give everyone every 
opportunity to give us feedback. 
Other items on the AC&M 
Student Advisory Councils 
agenda include the 1992-1993 
equipment plans, printing con
trol, and bulletin boards. The 
Student Advisory Council is ac
cepting comments via electronic 
mail. We welcome input from 
all students, said Morris.

REFERENDUM, from page i
the votes were valid. Weve seen 
that one day elections can work, 
said Neighbor.
The referendum has again 
sparked the debate on the du
ties of Student Senate and 
whether Senate has overstepped 
their bounds. Student Senates 
only purpose, in my view, is to 
distribute the funds paid by the 
students in the student activi
ties fee, said Joseph Goldman, 
a CIT Senator on the F&R Com
mittee.
But Shawn Knight, an MCS 
Senator on the Academic Affairs 
Committees disagrees, The du
ties of Student Senate are not 
clearly defined, but in my inter
pretation, Senate has been given 
authority to deal with Student 
Affairs, and if one group of stu
dents is discriminating against 
another group of students, 
whether that discrimination is 
forced upon by an outside influence or not, I think the Senate 
has the right to act against it. 
The resolutions future is still 
in a state of uncertainty. Gold
man said, I dont think any
thing will come out of this reso
lution, but we have to see what 
Faculty Senate says. Faculty 
Senate could have a lot more 
influence.
The resolution will probably 
stand as long as the current Sen
ate will stand, said Knight, re
ferring to the spring Senate elec
tions which will be occuring in 
less than a month.
A lot of returning Senators 
who votedforupholdingthe reso
lution may find themselves los
ing their seats. If that happens 
its very possible that their re
placements will want to over
turn the resolution.... said 
Knight, I hope that doesnthappen, but if it does, I know cam
pus is involved and gives a 
damn.

Letters to the Editor
Last week Student Senate let 
the student body voice its opin
ion on the Resolution Against 
Discrimination by ROTC at Car
negie Mellon by holding a refer
endum, as dictated by the re
straining petition submitted to 
Senate about a month ago. Sen
ate handled some aspects of the 
administration of the referen
dum well. Others, however, need 
to be improved in the future.
Publicity for the referendum 
was good, though a campaign 
beginning two weeks prior to the 
vote might have been more effec
tive than the last-minute deluge 
employed in this one. Public Re
lations Committee Chair Erik 
Larson and his committee dis
seminated information regard
ing the referendum effectively, 
though late, with ads in campus 
publications and posters on bul
letin boards and in residence 
halls.
The Fence was a fine, if muddy, 
location for the polls. Its cen
trally located and easily acces
sible to most voters. Its a good 
thing the weather on the day of 
the referendum was relatively 
nice, because the bad-weather 
location, Baker Hall, is inad
equate. While the Bookstore and 
campus offices attract a little traf
fic, its too far into the semester 
to expect a lot of people to be 
buying books. Also, long lines 
would cause traffic problems in 
Baker. Grey Matter would be a 
better bad-weather voting loca
tion, as it is both open and rela
tively centrally located.
Unfortunately, Student Senate 
was unprepared for the turnout 
of 22.7 percent. Long lines dis
couraged many who wanted to 
vote but were on their way to 
class. The voting setup  two 
lines, one for each half of the 
alphabetrestricted the voting
Student Senates Poster Policy 
is a relatively simple document. 
It states the maximum sizes of 
posters, the places where they 
may be hung, the maximum num
ber of posters per bulletin board, 
and so on. However, the policy is 
commonly violated. Posters are 
often placed over other posters; 
do not have the name of the spon
soring organization; are plas
tered over an entire bulletin 
board; or are placed on walls, 
windows, and doors.
Student Senate delegates the 
responsibility of enforcing the 
Poster Policy to Student Activi
ties. Student Activities hires 
work-study students who, about 
twice each week, collect old post
ers and posters which violate the 
Poster Policy. This is not ad
equate enforcement.
The Poster Policy insures that 
no organization gets an advan
tage over another because of 
unfair postering practices. As the 
policy states: The intent of this 
policy is to curtail abuse and 
insure that all student organiza
tions have equal access to the 
bulletin boards. The way the 
Poster Policy is being enforced 
now, it does not meet its intent.
rate to about four per minute. At 
this rate, the maximum number 
of students who could have voted 
in the eight hours the polls were 
open is 1,920, about 27 percent of 
the student body.
IfSenate expects alotofpeople 
to vote, it needs to be prepared 
for them. Splitting up the alpha
bet further to make three or four 
lines instead of two would help, 
as would keeping the polls open 
for two days instead of just one.
Part of the reason for the un
usually high voter turnout for 
this referendum was an unusu
ally high level of interest in this 
issue on the part of the campus 
community. It is unfortunate 
that students are usually less 
eager to perform their social re
sponsibility of taking part in stu
dent government by voting in 
Senate elections and other votes.
Students need to remember 
that not every decision Senate 
makes goes to referendum, so 
they should put more thought 
and effort into the elections of 
their Senate representatives. 
Senate should continue working 
to keep students informed and 
harness the interest shown in 
this vote for other votes, but 
theres only so far Senate can go. 
At some point the voters have to 
take the initiative, read the in
formation Senate provides, make 
well-thought-out decisions based 
on the issues, and vote.
We remind everyone that Stu
dent Senate elections are com
ing up March 18. The election 
board must keep in mind the 
successes and failures of the ref
erendum vote and use them to 
make this vote the best yet, and 
students must get out and vote 
to choose the Senators that will 
represent them. A turnout of 22.7 
percent is good, but its not good 
enough.
The Poster Policy also states 
that an organization is fined at 
least $5 for each poster improp
erly posted. This is not much of a 
fine for violating of an important 
policy. Student Senate should 
consider increasing the mini
mum fine so organizations will 
take the Poster Policy seriously.
Students should be responsible 
when putting up posters. The 
Poster Policy is simple and easy 
to understand. There are no ex
cuses for not following it. Any 
organizations which violate the 
poster policy are simply being 
malicious, lazy, or both. While 
obscuring an organizations 
poster may seem harmless, it 
can damage that organization 
by obstructing its publicity.
If Student Activities is sup
posed to be enforcing the Poster 
Policy, it should get moving and 
do the job. However, the ulti
mate responsibility lies with Stu
dent Senate. Senate created the 
policy  it should be making 
sure it is enforced. Unenforced 
policies are useless. Student Sen
ate should stop ignoring the 
Poster Policy and start investi

Black student angered by 
political cartoon
Editor:
As a student at Car
negie Mellon I am 
angry. Angry that 
events have tran
spired that lead me 
to write this statement. As a senior 
physics major, as an African American 
female, as President of SPIRIT organi
zation, and, most importantly, as a 
member of this campus community, I 
am appalled that I have cause to write 
this article. It is completely ridiculous 
to me that I pay $20,000 a year and I 
have to be faced with people whose 
insensitivity and ignorance is con
stantly treated with apathy. Whose 
cartoons are given credence, despite 
the fact that they are without merit and 
in no way correspond to any case his
tory. Whose pleas for assimilation into 
a society that has constantly taken and 
never given anything other than free 
reign for others to humiliate, ostracize, 
and condescend, go blithely by as if we 
were unruly children that will not con
form.
I find that I am embarrassed. Embar
rassed that I attend this University. 
Embarrassed that I encouraged people 
to attend, or if already here, to stay. I 
believed in the education that this in
stitution has to offer. But it seems that 
Carnegie Mellons commitment to edu
cation is very selective. Maybe the 
people who came to me frustrated and 
upset because of a day in class, or an 
article in the paper, or an anonymous 
phone call knew more than me. Maybe 
they knew that nothing would be done 
by way of retribution for transgres
sions made against them. Maybe they 
knew that no matter what their tal
ents, capabilities, or intellect they still 
had to prove that they were not the 
exception but the rule. And maybe, 
they knew that what they had just 
experienced was disturbingly similar 
to what the first minority students had 
to put up with back when we called it 
Carnegie Tech. But we dont have to 
put up with it. I expect, no, I demand 
the same consideration given to my 
white classmates. I take the same 
courses, I pay the same fees, I read the 
same newspaper. Never, should I see 
another slanderous piece directed to
wards an African American, be they a 
blue collar worker or a supreme court
justice. Never, should I see another 
belittling piece about women, be they 
white or black, be they old or young. 
This institution has a responsibility. It 
may not be responsible for the actions 
of its student body, but it is responsible 
for its reactions to the student body. 
Doing nothing does no one a favor.

Cartoon offends African 
American student
Editor:
People of today 
dont know what to 
complain about. We 
choose superficial 
topics and create 
problems instead of dealing with exist
ing problems. Then there are others 
who are continually tortured, terror
ized and misunderstood just because 
their skin is dark. But, do we African 
Americans, complain? Ablack male was 
beaten by three white males because of 
his friendliness with white females, 
but do we complain? A house on cam
pus in which only black students reside 
gets frequent prank calls from racial 
bigots, but do we complain? African 
American students ability to be ac
cepted into this university without jug
gling the rules is questioned, but do we 
complain? Black males who play on 
CMU sports teams are stopped at the 
gym door as their white counterparts 
walk by, but do we complain? Black 
students are attacked at fraternity par
ties, but do we complain? Some think 
we complain too much. But I think we 
dont complain enough.
Some feel that it is not their respon
sibility to learn about African Ameri
can culture, but African Americans are 
forced into learning about their cul
ture. Some feel that we should forget 
about being black and assimilate. This 
would be the ideal solution in utopia, 
but we arent living in utopia. We are 
living in an environment where we are 
constantly reminded that we are black. 
These reminders are not positive. We 
are not reminded that a black man 
invented the traffic light or that the 
first open heart surgery was performed 
by a black surgeon or that a black man 
designed the city plan for Washington, 
D.C. Yet, we are reminded that African 
Americans are inferior to whites and 
that we have animal-like tendencies. 
These falsities are allowed because of 
the ignorance of our society and be
cause of the failure of our society to 
educate.
If people tried to understand us in
stead of suppressing us, then we could 
triumph over racism. But why should 
white people understand us? Because 
everyday on this campus we are forced 
to understand them, to tolerate them, 
and to accept them. Why should Afri
can Americans make the only effort? Is 
it because we are the minority? I dont 
think so. We may think we are past the 
Jim Crow days but we are not. Racism 
has only taken a different form. Racism 
is more subtle, so subtle that some
times people dont recognize it. But I 
recognize it. I recognize it in the school 
newspaper when a black boxers speech 
is distorted to mimic the speech of the 
racist Sambo character. I recognize it
when a CMU student writes that we 
should give up our history and become 
American. I recognize it when the 
SPIRIT House cant hold a private party 
without Campus Police stopping by fre
quently. I recognize it everyday I leave 
my house. Some days the racial tension 
is so strong that I return home in tears, 
because I have to be 150 percent before 
Im accepted as half of a human being.
Some say that African Americans 
arent the only minorities with prob
lems and that we should be happy 
about our current situation because it 
is better than slavery. The fact that we 
are called minorities is the first prob
lem. This is where we have the right to 
start complaining. And the complain
ing should not stop until we, African 
Americans can live by the Constitution 
just as white Americans do.

Senate vote actions ap
pear to be hypocritical
Editor:
Congratulations to 
our Student Senate 
for proving once 
again that they are 
intellectually supe
rior to the rest of the CMU community! 
What other well respected body of this 
campus could single-handedly disre
gard the results of last Mondays cam
pus referendum concerning ROTC and 
its alleged unfair discrimination prac
tices against homosexuals. Once and 
for all, the Student Senate has stated 
on a vote of 11 to 15 to not.rescind the 
resolution, the same one that we as a 
campus rejected by 84 votes. How nice 
it was to be allowed to voice our opinion 
to our caring and courageous Student 
Senate! I am undoubtedly sure that 
Mike Tomblyn and Erik Altmann, our 
two heroic sponsors of the resolution, 
sincerely appreciated all the time their 
fellow students spent waiting in a line 
of up to 30 people to cast their votes 
against this PC resolution. Surely they 
valued our opinions, but not enough to 
rescind their trend setting resolution. 
Lets all give a round of applause to 
Senators Mike Tomblyn and Erik 
Altmann for steadfastly refusing to look 
facts in the face  the campus wants 
ROTC to stay. Yet again, their persis
tence in championing the cause of ho
mosexual rights through a tough Sen
ate, a lost referendum, and a furious 
campus, proved once again to be insur
mountable. Their valiant efforts have 
not gone unnoticed by this forever grate
ful campus community.
One day, I wish I could be as brave as 
these two fine Senate gods. Just imag
ine, I could go and meet Representative 
Gerry Studds from Massachusetts, or 
even be privileged enough to speak to a 
Congressional Sub-Committee justlike 
my Senator Tomblyn. Clearly, if a fine 
role model such as Rep. Studds sup
ports reversing the Department of De
fense policy against homosexuals, how 
couldl disagree? (Personally, I feel those 
charges of improper sexual conduct with 
his own male page, during a trip to 
Europe, are just totally unfounded.) I 
am extremely grateful that our student 
activities fee was wisely used to print a

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 February 19927
Referendum should carry weight
Jason McDonald
This week, we got a look at 
participatory democracy at its 
finest. Twenty percent of our 
campus came out to vote on the 
Resolution against Discrimina
tion by ROTC at CMU, and the 
results of that referendum (714 
to 629 in favor of rescinding the 
resolution, 19 abstentions) were 
then thrown out the window by 
a 1511 vote to let the resolution 
stand, with one Senator abstain
ingIn terms of my own feelings, I 
have to admit Im pleased with 
that result. I use a cynical logic 
that gets pretty good mileage  
Warner Hall isnt going to kick 
ROTC off campus because of a 
little Student Senate saber-rat
tling, so its nice to at least take 
the symbolic stand against dis
crimination. Sometimes youve 
just got to do whats right, and 
taking this stand against dis
crimination fits that definition.
Besides, whats done is done. 
The recommendation has been 
made, so its not really going to 
make a difference if Senate drops 
President Mehrabian a line say
ing, Remember how we told 
you ROTC should be booted from 
campus if discrimination con
tinues? Well, we were just kid
ding. Hope we didnt cause any 
trouble.
But the discussion of the ref
erendum raised some interest
ing questions. First of all, how 
many students have to vote be
fore we can conclusively say that 
all of campus is being repre
sented? Although 20 percent 
turned out to vote, the other 80 
percent didnt have time, didnt 
care, or got trapped under fall
ing beams  a common occur
rence, if prime-time television 
is any indicator.
There has to be some cutoff 
here; this campus will never see 
even a 50 percent (to pick a 
round number) voter turnout 
unless someone puts a proposal 
on the table to have Tetris re
moved from all campus comput
ers.
Second, how close is too close?
The pro-resolution senators all 
argued the statistics of the vote 
 according to them, there was 
enough error probability to de
clare a tie and leave the resolu
tion in effect. I suppose it would 
be too much for them to have 
ignored the error margins and 
go with the numbers they had, 
but then again, I got a D in 
Statistics II.
This battle soon degenerated 
into a debate over, essentially, 
which side should be on the of
fensive. This point of contention 
came about from the misguided 
notion that a side must win by a 
blowout to prove its conviction. 
The ROTC Senators (excuse the 
blanket characterization, but its 
easier to get the point across 
with the ROTC Senator label) 
argued that if the resolution was 
wanted, more people should 
have come out to support it. The
logic seemed to be that, since the 
resolution didnt get 80 percent 
approval, it must not be wanted. 
The flip side of the argument 
was that, obviously, there was 
no huge uprising against the 
resolution  no 80 percent vote 
to rescind. The battle over this 
point took on the flavor of an 
argument between four-yearolds. Am too. Are not, repeated 
ad infinitum.
Lastly, how is it that the vote 
of 20 percent of campus was su
perseded by the individual votes 
of Senators elected in an elec
tion with about 8 percent turn
out? If you go college by college, 
the referendum should have 
been shot down 5-3, with SUPA 
abstaining because of a tie. 
Somewhere along the line, de
mocracy went flying off the track, 
even before you take into ac
count the fundamental conflict
of interest that several Sena
tors ignored.
Apparently the concept of ethi
cal abstention got lost some
where, even though I under
stand the basic urge to protect 
your sides interests. Hell, if I 
were a Senator and were in 
cmuOUT or ROTC, I probably 
would have voted anyway. Its 
always easier to get on the moral 
high horse when youre not in 
the middle of the issue.
But for now the war is over. 
ROTC may yet try to push for 
amendments to the resolution, 
Warner Hall may or may not 
take action on the basis of the 
resolution, and the resolution 
may or may not change Depart
ment of Defense policy, but at 
least we can say we took a stand 
against discrimination. It would 
have been more powerful if the 
results of the referendum backed 
that stand up, but there are 
times when you have to take 
what you can get.
Jason McDonald' is a senior 
IM major who wants to get on 
Senate so he can disregard the 
results of referendums, too.
Rape policy offers survivors flexibility
Rich Robinson
Rape. Its one of those words that does 
not get the attention it should, because 
for the most part, people dont want to 
talk about it. And like AIDS, its a word 
that can be avoided, swept under the 
carpet and ignored.
Meanwhile, rape proliferates, spread
ing across campuses and across the coun
try, and Carnegie Mellon is no exception. 
In the 1990-1991 school year, Campus
Police recorded six rapes and the number 
is at one so far this school year. These 
small numbers coming out of campus 
security's satistics can be attributed to 
the fact that Student Affairs new policy 
dictates that Campus Police are only no
tified if the victim wants to do so.
Chief James LaPaglia noted, however, 
that if national averages are taken into 
account with CMIPs female population, 
there are about 20 rapes on campus each 
year. It has become such a significant 
problem that, after a year of committee 
meetings, Student Affairs created a sepa
rate CMU policy on sexual assault as well 
as a comprehensive program to help surStatistics across the United States place 
rape as one of the highest unreported 
violent crimes. It is no different here at 
CMU, supposedly a school for the nations 
most intelligent students. The estimate 
of 20 rapes per year comes from statistics 
which show that 10 to 50 percent of rapes 
go unreported, according to LaPaglia.
Michael Murphy, dean of Student Af
fairs, cites this as one of the reasons the 
policy was drawn up and the program 
started. Thats really why we address 
this, not because there are so many cases 
we are aware of, but because we are 
aware there are many cases we havent 
become aware of.
The media lately has not been very
helpful in changing this trend, either. 
The highly publicized Smith and Tyson 
trials put the burden more on the survi
vors than on the accused. What is not 
really publicized is that when a person 
has been raped she has been wronged, 
not only physically, but mentally. To be 
emotionally distraught and then abused 
by strangers like the media with doubts 
is destructive to someones well-being. 
This uncaring attitude illustrated by 
the media propagates the fact that com
ing forward will not be easy.
So it is about time that CMU has come 
up with a program to help survivors of 
assault that destroys this myth. The

of more lessons from Senators 
Mike Tomblyn and Erik Altmann, we could do away with all 
the other blatant injustices of 
the world! Thank you Senators 
for not carelessly ignoring the 
feelings of this campus, instead 
you have lead us to the glorious 
light!

Sophomore, H&SS
Staff member upset 
by column opinions
Editor:
In a Tartan 
column last 
week [ROTC 
and cmuOUT 
unable to com
promise, 2/17], Rich Robinson 
made a questionable attempt to 
sway public opinion with a 
poorly researched article which 
made both false assertions and 
used faulty logic. I should hope 
that The Tartans editors will 
take action to see that such poor 
writing does not continue.
Robinson states, The Novemher resolution is projected to be 
overturned, as it should be. 
Interesting that it was not over
turned, despite the fact that 10 
Senators are members of ROTC 
and no Senators are members of 
cmuOUT, and the inconclusive 
referendum was slightly in fa
vor of the ROTC position. Per
haps if you took the time to 
research the issue as the Sena
tors did, you would change your 
niind also.Then Robinson begins his 
string of lies: ROTC funding is 
separate from the University.... 
Not true  ROTC students re
vive some money directly from 
the University, [the University] 
Sives financial aid without bias. 
Not in the case of the extra book 
money it provides only to recipieQts of ROTC scholarships.
ROTC, as a program, is prob
ably one of the best organiza
tions for students. ROTC is the 
only organization I know of that 
has directly harmed a student 
on discriminatory grounds.
Robinson even resorts to faulty 
logic: ROTC funding is sepa
rate from the University, so the 
University is not in violation of 
anything. Even if the assertion 
were true, the University could 
still be in violation of the state
ment of assurance.
Robinson shows his total igno
rance of the issue by the state
ment , Those qualified students 
will go to MIT.... MIT had a 
student referendum on this is
sue quite a while ago, where the 
majority agreed (with 54 per
cent voter turnout) that ROTC 
should be removed from cam
pus, if it failed to stop discrimi
nating. In addition, the Faculty 
Senate directed the University 
to take action to remove ROTC, 
if the policy was not changed by 
1996 in a resolution supported 
by MITs president. CMU is far 
behind MIT on this human rights 
issue.
I find it interesting that people, 
like Robinson, who are opposed 
to the resolution often find it 
necessary to resort to falsehoods 
to support their position.
I hope the University will con
tinue to take action on this issue 
and not be swayed by such argu
ments.

Hockey club defend
ed by alumnus
Editor:
My name is 
Dennis A.
Frey, Jr., and 
I am a recent 
graduate of 
Carnegie Mellon University. I 
was also involved with the CMU 
Hockey Club for all four years of 
my undergraduate education, 
holding the positions of Co-Captain, Secretary, and President. 
The Hockey Club produced some 
of the fondest memories of my 
undergraduate career.
Recently, I received word from 
this years coach of the Hockey 
Club, David Collins, that Stu
dent Senate of Carnegie Mellon 
plans to make cuts in the fund
ing of the Hockey Club. As you 
may know, the Hockey Club is 
the highest funded sports club 
at Carnegie Mellon due to the 
extremely expensive cost of ice
time (approximately $150/hour). 
In the past, Student Senate has 
always been willing to fund at 
least the cost of ice rental. How
ever, this year, it appears that 
this body will not fund the 
Hockey Clubs ice-time, which 
would have terrible conse
quences for the Hockey Club. 
Simply said, the Hockey Club 
would disappear. There is vir
tually no feasible way that the 
Hockey Club could raise $8000- 
$10,000 for renting ice-time for 
games and practices. In my opin
ion, this would be a terrible loss 
for the University, because the 
Hockey Club carries a long tra
dition both at the University 
and in the western Pennsylva
nia/Pittsburgh area. The Carn
egie Mellon Hockey Club has 
been an organization on cam
pus for at least 25 years, and it 
was one of the charter members 
of their league, the Western 
Pennsylvania College Hockey 
Association. Furthermore, inter
est in the team grew substan
tially over the four years that I 
was there, and the promise of 
further growth was high, be
cause of the new rink built on 
the South Side of Pittsburgh.
For these reasons and a 
plethora of others, I believe that 
a cut in funding by Student Sen
ate would be a tragic move, both 
for the Hockey Club and other 
sports clubs that are unable to 
gain recognition at the Varsity 
level. Unfortunately, this policy 
seriously discriminates against 
these sports clubs that do not 
receive any other funding from
the University or the Athletics 
Department, and I would be very 
disappointed in bothStudent 
Senate and the University if this 
were to transpire.
Finally, I would appreciate a 
detailed reply to my concerns, so 
that I may pass them onto other 
past members of the Hockey 
Club.

History, 1991
Protectionism offers 
no help to America
Editor:
Im writing 
in response to 
last weeks ar
ticle by David 
Hunt on the 
current trade deficit with Ja
pan. I would like to comment on 
a few points he brought up:
 U.S. businesses are required 
by law to release quarterly earn
ings in addition to annual re
ports. A firms quarterly perfor
mance directly affects its stocks 
value. As a result, a firm con
stantly guards against earning 
losses in the short-term, which 
prevents it from taking on 
projects which generate payoffs 
at a later date. This may be the 
cause of the short-sightedness 
U.S. firms are often accused of. 
By contrast, Japanese firms are 
only required to release annual 
reports, making their horizons a 
little farther. This is a funda
mental difference in the way we 
do business, and we should not 
accuse people on Wall Street of 
being obsessed with a fast buck.
 Lobbying has and will always 
work under many political sys
tems. An elected official has to 
listen to his/her constituents or 
lose the next election. Thus, if 
the constituency has a special 
interest, the official cannot ig
nore it. Many governors are ac
cused of selling out to the Japa
nese when they try to lure Japa
nese companies to set up facili
ties in their own states. But the
simple fact is that such invest
ments create jobs for Americans 
and are beneficial.
 The European aircraft consor
tium is Airbus Industries, not 
Aerobus.
 Lastly, a comment on Hunts 
statement that, Free trade is 
the best trade, but only if it is 
truly free in both directions. I 
propose that free trade is the 
best trade, period. No other sys
tem works as well as free trade 
in ensuring that maximum col
lective good is achieved. Protec
tionist/Retaliatory measures are 
often counter-productive. One of 
the best examples is the passage 
of the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs in 
1930. Tariffs were imposed 
across the board, and prices rose 
an average of 59 percent. Other 
countries soon retaliated, result
ing in the Depression of efficient 
U.S. industries. Retaliatory 
measures do not solve the prob
lem, and only act to breed ill-will 
between nations.
The key to solving the prob
lem is to ensure that both sides 
understand each other. Cur
rently, emotions are running 
very high in both nations, and it 
only serves to prevent solving 
the problem. I only hope I have 
shed some light on the issue and 
increased peoples understand
ing.

8The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  24 February 1992
The Resolution Against 
Discrimination by ROTC at 
Carnegie Mellon was voted 
on last week with results of 
629for and 714 against keep
ing the resolution. Student 
Senate voted not to repeal 
the resolution after the re
sults were tabulated. What 
do you think about the 
referendum and Senates 
actions on the results?

I think that the Senates ac
tions on this matter dont make 
sense to me, because why have a 
vote when you are going to not 
listen to the constituencies. The 
turnout was representative of 
almost everybody who had an 
opinion.

I think that there should be 
no discrimination on the basis of 
ones sexuality. I dont think it is 
fair to disregard the results of 
the vote, though, just because it 
didnt turn out as Student Sen
ate wished.
Heather ODonnell

MEMS
I think ROTC has a right to 
be on campus and theyre just 
like any other organization. Why 
should we even have a Senate, if 
they arent going to listen to the 
students?
Vito Dragone HI

I feel ROTC should be allowed 
and if its their preference to 
exclude homosexuals, thats 
okay. And the results prove ... 
that this is a majority opinion 
and not a minority opinion.

Kicking ROTC off would 
be like a grain of sand on the 
beach compared to what re
ally needs to take place with 
our government. Disregard
ing a public vote is a form of 
discrimination in and of it
self.
Israeli attack continues cycle of violence
Chris Restifo
Violence, it is said, begets violence. 
Or, as Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
Muhatma Ghandi have both said, an 
eye for an eye soon leaves the world 
blind.
With the Mideast peace process un
derway, one would hope that Israel 
would have listened to this piece of 
advice before rushing into its self-pro
claimed security zone and conducting 
a search and destroy mission for 
Katyusha rocket bases.
The violence that led up to this event 
has been particularly bloody. Israeli 
helicopter gunships conducted a raid in 
south Lebanon that killed Hezbollah 
leader Abbas Musawi, his wife, and his 
son.
According to Israel, this act was in 
retaliation for the murder of three Is
raeli soldiers who were literally axed to 
death at an army camp.
Although the gruesome death of the 
three soldiers is in no way justified, 
Israels actions in the past week have 
been deplorable. The attack that re
sulted in the death of the Hezbollah 
chief was carried out against Palestin
ian refugee camps.
After the rocket attacks started, Is
rael conducted a raid that broke through 
the United Nations peace keeping force 
barricades. Several U.N. soldiers were
injured in the attack.
Already, the majority of the United 
Nations has condemned the attack. 
Secretary General Boutros-Ghali asked 
that Israel withdraw from Lebanon, 
and Syria indicated that it might be
come involved. As usual in its dealings 
with Israel, the U.S. State Department 
made a half-hearted attempt at chas
tising Israel by merely expressing deep 
concern.
What Israel failed to realize before it 
conducted this raid, it seems, is that it 
has a great deal to lose. Although Israel 
claims that the Fatah faction of the 
PLO killed the three soldiers, it has 
given the upper hand in the peace pro
cess to others.
Yes, the shelling from southern Leba
non was just as senseless and wrong, 
but by breaking through U.N. block
ades, Israel has proven that it will pay 
no heed to the United Nations, an orga
nization that can greatly help it in the 
Mideast talks.
Additionally, Israel has only in
creased the threat to itself. It has been 
reported that a shipment of Scud-C 
missiles, improved versions of the ScudBs used by Iraq in the Persian Gulf 
War, are being shipped from North 
Korea to Syria.
It appears as though this shipment is 
a smaller part of a plan that includes 
the technology to build a missile pro
duction plant.
If placed in Syria, these Scud-C mis
siles would be capable of reaching any 
position within Israel.
Of course, Israel has the right to take 
action given its current situation. One 
ofthe major requirements Israel places 
on any type of peace agreement is that 
others acknowledge Israels right to 
exist. Many groups such as Hezbollah 
call for the destruction of the Zionist 
state.
However, totally disregarding a U.N. 
peace-keeping force can do nothing but
covertly fund and supply other Arab 
nations in the area. Once the stalwart 
representative of U.S. interests in the 
Middle East, Israel has lost its strate
gic importance to the U.S.
By not conducting any strikes against 
Iraq during the Persian Gulf War while 
still being hit by Scud attacks, Israel 
placed itself in a good bargaining posi
tion.
infuriated about the murder ofthe sol
diers and the missile attacks.
But when peace talks are already on 
shaky ground and a new government is 
possibly on the way, violent actions 
that draw fire from the U.N. and others 
only hurt Israels position.
Even though army officials claimeda 
successful mission, several rocket at
tacks occurred while Israeli forces were
Israel's latest action, coupled with its insistence on the loan guar
antees for housing construction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
indicates that its government also fails to fully comprehend its situ
ation. There is no longer an adversarial Soviet Union to directly or 
covertly fund and supply other Arab nations in the area. Once the 
stalwart representative of U.S. interests in the Middle East, Israel 
has lost its strategic importance to the U.S.
hurt Israels position. Instead of strik
ing out on its own and conducting a raid 
that caused about 10,000 people to flee 
villages in Lebanon, Israel should have 
first made a formal complaint to the 
U.N. and given warning of its possible 
intentions.
Israels latest action, coupled with its 
insistence on the loan guarantees for 
housing construction in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, indicates that its gov
ernment also fails to fully comprehend 
its situation. There is no longer an 
adversarial Soviet Union to directly or
The strikes against the missile bases 
and the unnecessary breach of a United 
Nations blockade has made Israel out 
to be the bad guy.
From now on, representatives to the 
peace talks, still scheduled to proceed 
on this Monday, will be able to point to 
this incident as indicative that Israel is 
not willing to recognize an independent 
Palestinian state or even allow some 
autonomy.
Israels resolve to a lasting peace will 
also be called into question.
Those in Israel have every right to be
still withdrawing. Such a situation only 
makes Israels credibility more suspect. 
Its true that Israel has something to 
lose if it lets the rocket attacks or mur
ders continue unabated.
Israel has a great deal more to lose, 
however, if it returns every act of yjolence with even more death and . de
struction.
Chris Restifo is a junior chemical 
engineering major who believes the U.S. 
State Department actions are nothing 
more than lip service to the nation.
Carnegie Mellon sheds some light on campus security
There's no reason to be in the dark about campus security. A team of Carnegie Mellon police officers, security guards, and housing and student affairs staff members work to keep students, faculty, 
staff and visitors informed and safe on the campus and adjacent areas. These professionals who are concerned with the safety and welfare of the campus community are best able to answer questions 
about campus security.

% t the Forbes Gallery 
I this week, three stu| dent artists are going 
vMkxtX to be displaying what 
should prove to be a show that is 
really worth seeing. The artists 
have titled the exhibition Rev
elations. The work involved is 
'ffie' three artists discussion of 
spirituality through their art. 
Usually, group exhibitions have 
a tendency to lack in continuity. 
Individual artists formulate 
their own style of working, as 
well as bringing personal mean
ings to their work. Each piece is 
singularly unique. But when 
placed together in the context of 
a group show, the artwork 
clashes to the detriment of the 
show as a whole.
I ^Rarely is there an instance 
where a show exhibits a true 
level of synthesis. But in the 
ilptoming Forbes Gallery dis
play entitled Revelations, the 
Act of Making Known which 
runs from February 25 to March
1, the artists shared interest in 
ttie religious and the spiritual 
brings a contuinity to the dis-.
play.
The art of senior sculpture 
major Michelle Illuminato is a 
collection of creations that are 
intelligent, elegant artifacts  
artifacts that represent the art
ists love affair with objects. The 
spirituality in her work is tr ansmitted through persistent 
themes in her art pieces, themes 
of time, memory and the 
individuals passage in life.
One aspect of her work is the 
status of memories in an 
individuals life. The passing 
moment becomes a souvenir or 
relic and as a result, marks its 
place within the trivialities of 
life. Illuminatos memories are 
autobiographical. Her work fo
cuses on these life experiences 
and abstracts these experiences 
until they become universal. 
Each memory contains a his
torical background which 
reaches back into time.
One installation piece of 
Illuminatos will be displayed 
in one of the front windows of 
the Forbes Gallery. The piece 
will consist of a treasure chest 
placed in one window and an 
altar in the other.
The treasure chest will hold a 
collection of two hundred grab
 "bags that the viewer will be
invited to take as a prize. Each 
bag will hold an item that con
tains a specific physical memory 
from the artists life  some 
precious and some not so pre
cious. Each object is labelled with 
its origin, recording how and 
when it was acquired. Like a 
piece in a museum, the items 
are classified and given signifi
cance. The patron will be asked 
to sign for each and then become 
the possessors of the object, with 
the choice to keep the object, 
ignore it, or throw it away.
The second aspect of this in
stallation is the altar where the 
viewer is asked to contribute an 
object in their possession. Thus 
completing a cycle of giving, both 
physical and spiritual.
Illuminato relies on Roman 
Catholic forms to present her 
work, with each piece in its own 
way resembling altars or reli
quaries. She appropriates these
items and gives them a signifi
cance and spirituality uniquely 
her own, converting their mean
ing to one specific to her.
Elise Soroka is another artist 
with a sense of spirituality 
present in her work. Soroka is a 
senior painting major who uti
lizes her talent to create unique 
canvases. Her paintings are presented as interchangeable 
wooden blocks. The blocks, ac
cording to Soroka, become 
...inadverdently narrative like 
a stream-of-conscience poem. 
The blocks can be manipulated 
and positioned by the viewer, 
like a game or a puzzle, to con
struct their own image.
The imagery Soroka uses is 
sensual and sometimes erotic. 
The erotic aspects of the pieces 
are metaphors about the per
petuation of life. This evokes an 
emotional rather than an intel
lectual response. The angel fig
ure recurrs throughout her 
works, yet they are not the sa
cred and revered images of tra
ditional Christian iconography. 
The angels are flawed, portrayed 
with human traits  mundane 
and sexual.
Her figures are androgynous, 
the men almost fertile, the 
woman uncurvacious. Soroka 
argues that the wholeness is 
achieved when a person realizes 
their possession of both female 
and male traits.
The use of Christian imagery 
is repeated once again in the 
work of Hope Johnson. During a 
semester in France, Johnsons 
exposure to medieval churches 
greatly influenced her art pieces. 
Most of her work is religiously 
based.
One of the pieces that will be 
displayed will be a reliquary  
a container traditionally used to 
house sacred artifacts of saints 
such as blood, bones, clothing, 
or even tongues. Inside the reli
quary is a crutch. The crutch 
represents an allusion to reli
gion.
Religion is a necessary crutch 
which allows man to be afraid 
because the purpose of religion 
is to explain the unknown and 
what we dont understand. Reli
gion is one of the most danger
ous concepts that man ever in
vented; yet, its wonderful, says 
Johnson. .
One piece from a different per
spective is a painting which con
fronts the viewer with an x-ray 
enlargement of Johnsons right 
hand which, due to a birth de
fect, has only two digits. Somet 
people are scared away by such 
a deformity. Superimposed over 
this image are words and 
phrases which were often used 
in a derogatory manner. Words 
like crab, claw, .ugly, does it 
hurt? force the viewer to ana
lyze his/her own response to the 
painting. Johnson explains,  
...this part of the b'ody has been 
considered ugly and it is dis
played to an open audience."
With their unique style and 
interest in the religious and 
spiritual, Revelations, the Act 
of Making Known, should be a 
fascinating exhibit. This type of 
display - three artists working 
together to create a single ex
hibit  is not to be missed.
There is notalways going to be 
this type of continuity in the 
Forbes Gallery, an it should be 
appreciated while it is available, 
from February 25th to March 
1st.

someone who considers trips to the 
museum an almost 
sacred ritual, I prob
ably go to the museum more 
than I go to church, and having 
the Carnegie Museum so close 
by is a welcome blessing. Yet 
even if you only go to the Carn
egie once a year, the permanent 
collection can become dull, and 
now that the Carnegie Interna
tional is ending, there is even 
less new work to see. Fortunately 
the Carnegie has successfully 
balanced its permanent collec
tion with a series of exhibitions 
that they hold in the Forum gal
lery. For the last several years 
the Forum has held shows by a 
variety of artists working in dif
ferent disciplines, from computer 
art to pottery.
The present exhibition at the 
Forum gallery is a video instal
lation by Rita Myers, an assis
tant visiting artist who teaches 
Masses here at Carnegie Mellon. 
Her work is titled Phantom Cit
ies and is an eerie landscape 
that explores issues of time, place 
and the environment. Her inamidst.crumbling walls and up
rooted trees.
The televisions play three dif
ferent channels of video tape, 
the images in constant change. 
The monitors flow and ebb with 
different scenes of urban and 
natural landscapes. Juxtaposed
are images of New York city 
against the remains of Mayan 
temples, scenes of differing natu
ral environments against the 
decay of the city. The video im
ages pass through cycles, all the 
monitors in sync with the oth
ers. At times they will all show
quick-paced images, other times 
they will all go black leaving an 
uncomfortable silence. Through
out the different cycles a slow 
persistent heartbeat grows that 
eventually vibrates throughout 
the room. The heartbeat works 
its way into the fiber of the piece
stallation fills the space of the 
gallery and surrounds the 
veiwer. You walk into the room 
and become an active member 
in the artists work.
The room is darkened and 
much of the light comes from the 
eight television monitors that 
are hung on wires suspended 
from the ceiling. Central in the 
room is an island of sand out of 
which emerge the remains of 
cities, skyscrapers and ancient 
temples, all half buried in the 
sand. The structures in the sand 
are about the size of 
architectural models, yet they 
become a metaphor for civiliza
tion in general and convey a 
sinister fate. Surrounding this 
are television sets that are placed

and forces an immediacy into 
what would otherwise be a fairly 
serene and contempletive instal
lation.
The relationship between the 
contemporary world to the past 
civilization is a strong current 
in Myers Phantom Cities. What 
we seem to be presented with is 
a time-lapse movie showing so
ciety in the inevitable decay. The 
Mayan temples, empty and mys
terious are placed right next to 
large skyscapers that are life
less. The obvious metaphor com
paring our crumbling society to 
that of the abandoned and for
gotten towers of past cultures is 
very much a part of the work. 
But there is also is the deeper 
overwhelming aspect of the piece 
that speaks of our cultures loss 
of spirituality and a tie to the 
land. The four elements earth, 
air, water, and fire become the 
spiritual symbols of the work, 
contrasts to the stark concrete
ness of our culture.
Rita Myers Phantom Cities is 
an exciting and engaging art
work that any viewer will find is 
approachable and thought pro
voking. Its message makes a 
long-lasting impression on its 
audiences.

Survivors
-SURVIVORS, from page 7
I program has been structured so 
that anyone going through it has 
complete control over what happens.
As Murphy says, The key is 
to focus on that person and what 
is best for each individual. Be
cause of this focus, nothing is 
done without the individual 
 making the decision. Each indi
vidual also chooses an advisor 
'' who has been trained to advise 
n' people involved with sexual as
sault.
These advisors help give ad
vice in choosing counseling help, 
~ medical help, legal assistance, 
po and are able to provide security 
w" through Campus Police such as 
an escort.
They are there to make sure 
the person understands the sup
port available to him or her and 
; help him or her choose from 
" among the options. In addition, 
the advisors are there for con*' tinued support, from being a 
"' friend to helping a survivor bring 
the offender to justice.
Murphy was also very ada
mant about one pointthe con- fidentiality of the individual. To 
the members of the Sexual As
sault Team, the individual is 
the first priority and nothing is 
compromised.
Murphy noted that this was 
important, because if even one 
individuals confidentiality was 
. compromised for a greater good,
- like ridding the campus of the 
~ accused rapist, it would compro
mise the validity of the program.
M.Then people would not be willing to come forward, and therel; fore the program would be worthless, unable to help the people
 that need it.
By coming forward, survivors 
rrcan accomplish something. From 
^'just getting the support he or 
she needs, to using the Uni. versitys channels, to prosecute 
. through the University CommitA.tee on Discipline to prosecution 
through the city of Pittsburgh. 
^ - The Crime Alerts are an example 
. of what an individual can choose 
to do, as they appear only with
 the victims consent.
If a person wants some type of 
action, the action is either infor
mal or formal. Informal action 
includes such things as the Uni, versity intervening by calling 
the accused offender and makM. ing sure no contact is made be~'tween the two individuals iri- -volved, or at the other extreme,
allowing the survivor to confront 
; the accused in a one-on-one con
versation. Formal action in- eludes internal and external ac- tions which are not mutually 
-exclusive.
 An individual can have his or

NAVY OFFICER I
have many choices
her case brought up in front of 
the University Committee on 
Discipline to judge if the accused 
is guilty. From there, the crimi
nal can be suspended or, most 
likely in the case of rape, ex
pelled. Externally, the case can 
go to the city of Pittsburgh courts, 
which, according to Murphy, do 
a very good job of supporting a 
woman in cases like this. All 
through this, as well, the person 
has the support of his or her 
advisor and the school, which 
will provide counseling and 
medical help, in addition to some 
legal assistance.
When asked about the process 
and how effective it is, Murphy 
said, I would like to see the 
process followed, because I think 
it is a healthy process, I think 
that the process works, and I 
think it is an important mes
sage about what the campus 
community wants.
Yet, he also added, Im most 
comfortable with what the per
son wants.
If the person only wants to 
talk about it and get the help 
and support he or she is looking 
for, he or she will not be pressed 
to do anything.
Each individual is made aware 
of the costs as well as the ben
efits of any action before making 
a decision.
Even so, Murphy added, If 
someone is not sure what action 
they want to take, we do encour
age them to keep their options 
open, such as getting a medical 
exam, which is needed for crimi
nal prosecution, but not neces
sarily for internal formal action.
Because of the fact that most 
rape cases go unreported, I asked 
Murphy what his advice for 
people who havent come for
ward is.
Come forward. The level of 
support we provide, both from 
the possibility of taking action, 
remedial or punitive, but also 
the counseling and medical type 
support is beneficial to the indi
vidual involved. Our clear and 
number one priority is on survi
vors of sexual assault.
It doesnt matter if the assault 
occurred three weeks ago or 
three years ago, the school is 
here to help. As a community,
we have much more to gain by 
dealing with these issues openly 
than pretending they do not ex
ist, says Murphy.
Other support mechanisms 
are also on campus to help sur
vivors of rape. The Counseling 
Center has begun a program for 
survivors of date or acquaintance 
rape that is separate from the 
Sexual Assault Team. It is a 
support group, called Breaking 
the Silence, made up of survi
vors of rape or any type of sexual 
assault at all stages of recovery.
Marilyn Goldsmith, a coun
selor at CMU and a member of 
the Task Force, and Juliana 
Diaz, a counselor, have begun 
this group as a support mecha
nism for women to help each 
other through recovery.
The most important thing for 
a survivor to know is that they 
are not at fault. It does not mat
ter what they were wearing, if 
they were drinking, or if they 
think they didnt say no force
fully enough, says Goldsmith. 
All that matters is that they 
said no and/or tried to stop it.
I am very separated from the 
reality of rape, just as the major
ity of you are. But it happens, 
and it happens here on our cam
pus. A place of higher learning 
such as CMU is no different from 
any other place in the country in 
this matter. We cannot ignore 
the problem any more. It is too 
.important to sweep under the 
carpet.
But if, as a community of stu
dents and staff, we come together 
to help survivors, maybe we can 
change the statistics.
First, we need to prevent rape

PRESS PASS

Would you be 
a first round 
draft pick?
This week, the Pittsburgh 
Penguins made their annual 
Big Trade. For you non-hockey 
fans, three teams, seven 
players, draft picks, and lots of 
contract money were involved. 
Im not going to comment on 
that deal sequence (other than 
a general vote of approval), but 
on a thought related to the 
business of professional 
athletics. Specifically, that 
question would be, What if all 
aspects of life were like profes
sional sports?
This goes beyond the simple 
scenario of trading CMUs 
varsity athletes for other 
schools players, though whos 
to say how the basketball 
season would have gone if we 
swapped Brian Zimmerman 
and the golf team to Rochester 
for Chris Fite? I talk of the 
effects on the life of normal 
 people, like you and me.
First of all, CMU would have 
the option of dealing us to 
other schools  no discussion 
and no questions asked. I can 
hear my fate being decided in 
the Registrars Office right 
MOW. Damn it, McDonalds 
only carrying a 2.9 QPA. Hes 
obviously not going to get a job 
that will allow him to give us 
 lots of money. Lets deal him to 
Pitt for some medical stu
dents.
This would, of course, allow 
' CMU to pull all sorts of clever 
tricks. If a student is getting 
'too much financial aid, send 
him or her elsewhere. Deal a 
bunch of promising computer 
science majors to get the 
money to finance the Univer
sity Center. Tinker with the 
male-to-female ratio that 
everyone loves to whine about.
An idea which would corre
spond to the process of salary 
arbitration would be tuition 
review. Both you and the 
University would bring in 
lawyers and statisticians to 
prove why your tuition needs 
to be higher or lower. In my 
case, I would fall back on the 
argument that my Tartan time 
should be worth some rebate, 
and that, as a commuter, I 
dont enjoy equal usage of the 
campus. Theyd respond with 
my attendance records and 
that stats test I got a four on 
(though I could try to convince 
the arbitrator that my mini
mal attendance just proves Im 
: not getting my moneys worth).
Then, theres always the 
question of free agency. Would 
there actually be any? It would 
be great if you could hold out 
for a better deal, or take your 
grades to the highest bidder 
; (or lowest tuition). Instead of 
blindly filling out the financial 
aid forms, you could haggle 
with them. Tell the Cashiers 
Office that you heard USC was 
looking for a good mechanical 
engineer, and that theyve 
offered you a competitive 
Package. If that doesnt drop 
the price a couple of grand, 
offer to settle for a car and 
time-sharing on a condo in 
:iprida. That way, they get to 
look like they crushed your 
empty threats, and you still 
get something for your efforts.Better yet, have your agent deal with them.

The West Penn College Hockey 
Association semifinals took place 
in Morgantown, West Virginia, 
last Saturday afternoon. 
League-leading West Virginia 
played in the first game against 
fourth-place Penn State West, 
and won in an easy game, 91.
Third-place Carnegie Mellon 
played the University of Pitts
burgh for the third time this 
season.
The first encounter was pen
alty filled and ended in a 43 
Pitt victory. Just two weeks ago 
the rivals met; that time CMU 
got the win, 54. Yesterday, how
ever, with both teams away from 
home, the story was quite differ
ent.
Only 2:21 into the game, CMU 
set the pace for a long afternoon
for the Pitt Panthers. Freshman 
Greg Jessop and senior Adam 
Duncan combined to assist 
graduate student John Cam to 
the teams first goal.
At 14:45, Pitt countered with 
a goal of its own to tie the game 
at one. Thirty-five seconds 
elapsedbefore senior captain Ed 
Kilduff s deluge of point-scoring 
began. He managed an assist to 
graduate student and tri-captain Erik Galis, who scored the 
goal that put CMU on top for 
good.
Thirteen seconds later, just 
after winning the face-off, Galis 
and Kilduff assisted Jessop on 
CMLPs third goal. With 12 min
utes left in the first period, the 
Tartans had taken a 3-1 lead 
and were dominating the game 
in every aspect.
With 6:30 left in the first pe
riod, Galis and Kilduff again had
assists, this time to graduate 
student Scott Sarbacker. With 
2:14remaining, junior Jan-Marc 
Featherston and Sarbacker as
sisted Kilduff to his first goal of 
the game on a power play. The 
period ended with Carnegie 
Mellon on top, 51.
Thesecondperiod followed the 
direction the first had set. 
Though Pitt scored first on a 
power play 4:34 into the period, 
less than four minutes later 
Jessop andKilduff assisted Galis 
to his second goal and fourth 
point of the day, while Kilduff 
turned in his fifth of eight points.
After two crucial Pitt penal
ties, Carnegie Mellon went on a 
5-3 power play. Freshmen P.J. 
Mann and Jessop assisted 
Kilduff to his second goal, makingthe score 7-2. Still on a power 
play, Kilduff and Galis assisted 
Sarbacker once again. Pitt
scored in the last minute of the 
second period to finish its scor
ing.
In the third period Carnegie 
Mellon dominated with 24 shots 
on goal, but made only one. 
Sarbacker and Galis assisted 
Kilduff, giving him another hat 
trick for the season.
The victory against Pitt re
sulted in a third meeting with 
West Virginia, this one for the 
league championship, yesterday. 
CMU went into the game with a 
1-0-1 record against the Moun
taineers.
The first game, played in 
Morgantown, ended in a 3-3 tie 
after a great comeback by Carn
egie Mellon, who was down 3-0 
with only two minutes left to 
play in the game. The second 
game was dominated by CMU, 
who won 3-i).
Yesterdays championship
game proved to be the perfect 
highlight to a great season. WVU 
scored first 5:31 into the game. 
Less than a minute later Cam 
got the assist from Jessop and 
doctoral student Dave Collins. 
With five minutes left in the 
period, WVU took back the lead, 
21. The second periodbelonged 
to CMU, as Kilduff got assists 
from Galis and Featherston to 
tie the game.
WVU scored their last goal of 
the game with 6:00 to play in the 
second. Kilduff and Galis as
sisted Jessop for the tying goal 
as the game went into the third 
period 3-3.
The third period, as has been 
true all year, proved to be CMU's 
winning period. The game went 
back and forth until Kilduff got 
the assist from Featherston to 
take the game and the WPCHA 
championship, 4^3.
Women smash Emory, 56-31

Tartan Assistant News Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens bas
ketball team ended its home season on 
a positive note, blasting Emory Univer
sity, 56-31. The win gave the Tartans a 
18 4 overall record, as well as a 10-2 
mark in the University Athletic Asso
ciation.
If you keep their leading scorer from 
touching the ball, theyll get rattled. 
said sophomore forward Jeanine 
Megahan. A good defensive team is 
always going to beat a good offensive 
team.
The outcome of the game was obvious 
after the first few minutes. The Eagles 
didnt get their 10th point of the contest 
until the final three minutes ofthe half; 
overall the Eagles shot a paltry 10 for 
45 (.222).
The Tartans opened the door some
what by allowing theEaglestogotothe 
free throw line 23 times, but Emory 
converted less than 50 percent of their 
attempts. The most telling statistic was 
the Eagles 32 turnovers.
The Tartan defense was especially 
hard on freshman Mandy Jackson, 
Emorys leading scorer. Jackson had 
been averaging more than 20 points a 
game, but the Tartans held her to six 
points, and forced her to turn the ball 
over seven times.
Head coach Gerri Seidl gives most of 
the credit to senior guard Katie Fahey. 
We planned it so that Katies whole job 
was to not let her have the ball, and she
did a great job.
The blowout began in earnest at the 
start of the second half. Emory scored 
the first basket of the game to cut the 
lead to 2916, but that would be its last 
point for the next 13 minutes. The Tar
tans went on a 22-point runa stretch 
during which Emory would miss 15 
consecutive shots. With 6:37 remain
ing, the Tartans held a 35-point (51 
16) lead, the widest of the contest.
Emory put together a brief 12i rally, 
during which the Carnegie Mellon se
niors  forward Amy Buxbaum and 
guards Fahey, Heather ODonnell, and 
Bridget Eperthener  took their joint 
curtain call. Emory managed to shave a 
few more points off the lead before the 
clock ran out.
Theyre a youngteam [eight ofthe 12 
Eagles are freshmen], said Seidl. We 
wanted to ... confuse them. I think it 
worked well because their players just 
werent experienced enough to adjust 
out on the floor.
The Tartans were led by Buxbaum 
with 14 points and sophomore forward 
Mary Moore with 10 points. On the 
boards, Buxbaum was the team leader 
with 8; Eperthener and ODonnell had 
strong games, adding seven and six 
assists, respectively.
On the surface, the Tartans perfor
mance could be viewed as surprising 
considering the team had a nine-day 
break between games. However, ac
cording to members of the team, the 
break was more of an advantage than a 
problem.
It wasnt a problem because we try 
to run every practice as if it were a 
game situation, said Megahan. When 
you do that, you keep the intensity up, 
and you dont lose your sharpness. 
Sometimes its tough to practice up
tempo every day, but we had some 
really good practices this week, said 
Seidl. Also, the long break gave us 
time to heal, so I think the schedule 
actually played in our favor.
The Tartans close out their season 
this weekend with a high-stakes road 
trip to Chicago and St. Louis. Since the 
Tartans are currently ranked fifth in 
the region, their best hope for a NCAA 
playoff berth rests on winning the UAA 
title.
Although the importance of Fridays 
game against Chicago shouldnt be un
derstated  a loss in Chicago would 
almost surely make Sundays game with 
Washington meaningless  the last 
game of the season should be the big
gest. Washington and CMU are tied for 
the conference lead, and the Bears took 
a 55-54 win from the Tartans earlier 
this season in Skibo Gym.
I thought that when we played them 
here, we were 10 points better than 
that team, said Megahan. There was 
no way we should have lost. If we ex
ecute our game plan well and play good 
defense, we should be fine.
I dont think we have to do anything 
different or better, said Seidl. Its go
ing to be a close game, and we just need 
to be on the right end of that one-point 
win this time.
Men bounce back
By L. KOCHANSKYJ
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball team bounced back 
from last weekends 41 point loss 
to the University of Rochester, 
in first place in the UAA, to 
defeat Emory University 9476 
this weekend.
Carnegie Mellons record im
proved to 3-9 in the UAA (812 
overall), while Emory Univer
sity droped to 3-10 in the UAA 
(716 overall).
The Tartans began well, hit
ting three three-pointers, two 
by sophomore guardRony Johns. 
With eleven minutes in the half, 
Carnegie Mellon went on a 13-0 
run led by junior forward Chris 
Benec with seven points.
They took a 37-18 lead at this 
point and by the end of the half 
had extended it to 50-30. Johns 
led the offense with 15 points 
and Benec hadll points. Sopho
more center Charlie Connors 
grabbed seven rebounds and 
scored eight points.
Head coach Tony Wingen was 
very pleased with the teams per
formance. We got off to a good 
start and had a big first half. I 
was very pleased with our re
bounding. The Tartans out-re
bounded the Eagles 28-18.
Emory started the second half 
by out-scoring Carnegie Mellon 
15-7 to cut the deficit to 12 
points, but that was the closest 
the Eagles came for the rest of 
the game.
CMU answered with a 7-0 
run, sparked by a three-pointer 
from sophomore forward Matt 
Reiprish, and increased the score 
to 64-45.
The pace of the game slowed 
considerably in the last seven 
minutes with both teams com
mitting numerous fouls. I was 
not pleased with all the fouls. 
We were reaching and grabbing 
towards the end. It started to 
get ragged out there, said 
Wingen.
Despite the slower pace, CMU 
put together another run, this 
time 9-0, and built its lead to 23 
points, the biggest of the game.
Emory applied a full-court 
press the entire game, but Car
negie Mellon handled it well. 
We were prepared for the press 
even though we thought it was a 
bit surprising that they chose to 
use it, said Wingen.
The Tartans were led by a 
very strong shooting perfor
mance by Johns who finished 
with 19 points on five shots out 
of seven from the field (includ
ing four out of six from threepoint range) and five out of six 
from the foul line. Johns was 
one of five Tartan players to 
finish with double figures in scor
ing.
Connors had 14 points and 
nine rebounds; sophomore for
ward Mike Hosni added 13 
points; junior guard Todd 
Jenkins finished with 10 points 
and 10 assists; and Benec scored 
11 points.
Strong on the boards was 
sophomore center Derek Dragisich, who pulled down nine re
bounds and scored nine points. 
Freshman guard Dwayne Cole
man contributed nine points as 
well.
Wingen was visibly pleased 
with the victory. The team did a 
terrific job. It feels good to win 
one. We will have a lot of mo
mentum going into our final two 
games.
The Tartans end their season 
with two league games on the 
road. They play the University 
of Chicago Thursday night, and 
finish against Washington Uni
versity of St. Louis on Saturday.
Track runs at RMC
By MARK HIT ,T ,TKR
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Carnegie Mellon mens and 
womens track teams competed 
in the Robert Morris Invita
tional on Friday. Despite dis
organization due to a recent 
turnover in personnel, and 
heavy competition from more 
than ten teams, many of which 
were Division I, both teams 
performed well. Many mem
bers of both teams broke their 
personal records this weekend 
and will continue to perform 
well at the upcoming Univer
sity Athletic Association 
Championships in Chicago 
March 8.
Senior Carolyn Lowe won the 
5000-meter run with a time of 
18:08. Junior Laura Sibley ran 
a personal best time in the 
1500-meter run with a time of 
5:01, and placed third in her 
event. Senior Susan Wempa 
placed third in the long jump 
with a distance of 15'1", and 
sophomore Ersula Cosby 
placed secondinthe triple jump 
with a distance of 32'10". 
Sophomore Aliza Hildebrand 
ran 2:44 in the 800-meter run 
and sophomore Jody Piccolo 
ran a 1:09 in the 400 meters.
Womens coach Dario Donatelli said, Everybody that com
peted this weekend either set 
their personal or seasonal best 
time in their event, and we are 
heading for the UAA Indoor 
Track Championships in two 
weeks at the University of Chi
cago. It is very encouraging 
and everyone is looking for
ward to the next few weeks. 
The men came out strong 
with many members of the 
team placing in the top five of 
their events. Junior Chris 
Maguire set a personal record 
in the 55-meter dash and took 
fourth-place with a time of 6.6 
seconds.
Following closely were 
sophomores Jarrod Siket and 
Brandyn Woodard, neither of 
whom placed, with times of 6.7 
and 6.8 seconds respectively.
Siket and Senior Bill Isaacs 
placed in the top five in the 
200-meter run, with times of 
23.5 and 23.8 seconds. The 
mile relay team won with a 
combined time of 3:32.
With a time of 2:01, junior 
Sean Pempel won the 800- 
meter run. Freshman Kevin 
Keir won the 35-pound weight 
throw. Junior Jason Lang

For a long time you thought youd move to a cabin in the Smokies after graduation.You were going to live there comfortably with a friend and a dog and all of your books.In the morning youd wake up and feed the dog. Maybe hoe the garden. You thought it would be so simple to live like that, and that there would finally be enough time to write everything down in a little book. You figured youd learn from yourself. Whats funny about all of this is that what you wanted to think about was life. Youre laughing right now, thinking about the ridiculous idiot with her dog alone in a vegetable garden; doing nothing, seeing nothing. But theres no time to dwell in the past. Something has happened. You read in a Studs Terkel book, Working, about a woman named Dolores Dante whos very smart and interesting. Every night she goes to work and becomes an actress on a dining-room-floor stage.
I have to be a waitress. How else can I leam about people? How else does the world come to me? I cant go to everyone. So they have to come to me. Everyone wants to eat, everyone has hunger. And I serve them. If theyve had a bad day, I nurse them, cajole them. Maybe with coffee I give them a little philosophy. They have cocktails, I give them political science.
Shes a waitress because she loves her work; she observes her audience and learns from them. You want to love something, to live like Dolores in the world she interprets. Maybe you wont be a waitress forever, but to start, a waitress.
Then theres Jean Stanley, a cosmetic saleswoman from Connecticut. Jeans an observer, and a listener, too. Shes some kind of therapist.
Customers ask your advice. They rely on you. If youve worked in one of these places for a number of years, you have a following. People come in and wait for you actually. You become a little bit of a friend. They can speak to a stranger more than they can to an acquaintance. They may tell you some little tragedy or something. You leam a lot about people when youre with the public all day. There are so many lonely people. So many women between the ages of forty and seventy.
Youve worked with the public before and it was terrible. As a fitting room attendant in a busy department store, they called you little bitch when you tried to hand them number tags for their clothes. But when you now realize how much you could have learned, you stop for a minute. Maybe what went wrong was your concentration on the negative. You missed something crucial back then in the same way you miss the important parts of books now  by paying attention to the rotten typeface or unexciting style. Those are the books you shove to the back of the bookcase. If you'd just go back... you think. You could work in a supermarket. You know that going back is a very important thing to do, just as long as you bring your little book with you. You can keep it in your smock.

A Change 
in Life
Augustine Kuo Dancing sunbeams on the rain forest ground
From movement above, playful monkeys swing 
Near singing birds with rainbow feathers 
Together make a raucous sound
A light breeze causes a stillness of life 
As wisps of white smoke rise to the air 
Then raging hot it is everywhere 
The life that was, enshrouded in blackness
A house, a road, a farm and garden 
Built on acres and acres of ashes 
People come and build their lives 
Would they have to ask a pardon?
Dancing couples on the grassy ground 
Moving to the playing musicians swing 
Near ladies young with rainbow dresses 
Together make a festive sound

Clearing the Basement
Written by
Louis Faassen
Lisa says there are rats in the house. 
Sometimes when it is quiet, I listen hard and try 
to determine myself if this is true, but there is a 
persistance of small noises here which leaves me 
unsure. The top two floors of the house are vacant, the doors locked. I have not seen inside 
them, but the notion that there are creatures 
besides ourselves here is a distinct possibility. 
Lisa will not have a cat, however, and so I shrug 
my shoulders when she speaks of rats.
I have asked her, You want me to leave 
poison out?
Im sure it would get in the food. There 
are people who have died that way. They 
shrivel up.
I nodded and imagined people with hol
lowed cheeks and sunken eyes, all wondering 
why they were wasting away.
Did you know the poison freezes your 
blood? It would dry you up into nothing. 
Someone said something like that to me 
once, I told her, Maybe it was my mother.
She wouldnt leave poison either. But at least we had a cat.
You still had rats, though, didnt you?"
She was insistent. "Rats are too big for most 
cats."
If we did, I never knew it," I said. "Well. 
Only once, we had one. It crawled out from 
behind the sofa. Everyone was in the living 
room watching television. I must have been 
about twelve. It was quite a stir.
Lisa shuddered and held up her hands. She 
would not speak of such things.
My father was home when the rat ap
peared. Id watched him put a bucket over it.
He slid a National Geographic off the coffee 
table underneath the bucket and carried it 
outside. The animal was old or sick or some
thing. I watched from the kitchen window of 
the old house. My father lifted the bucket in our back yard and picked up a piece of firewood

from the stack by the porch. The rat didnt 
move, it was perched on its hind feet, sniffing 
the air and it had seemed to me that it was trying to think.
My mother insisted that my father burn 
that copy of the National Geographic and he 
obliged. In thirty three years of issues on four 
shelves in our living room, that is the only issue 
missing.
* * *
The murmerings below the apartment 
floorboards have been here for as long as we 
have. I listen to the gas furnace with its dull 
roars and sputters. Also there is the whirring of 
the big freezers motor. With my head to the 
floor I hear the gurgle of pipes and valves and 
the click of meters. Ive seen them and believe 
them to be original plumbing. Whether this 
makes a difference in plumbing I cant say, but 
the pipes are a part of many things here which I 
believe are soon to be beyond repair. The 
sound down there now is none of these things.
It is a living, shifting impatience.
I have been sipping early Saturday morn
ing coffee, listening. It's just becoming light I 
put my ear low to the floor again, hoping Lisa 
doesn't wake up. She doesnt ask me to explain 
myself anymore; at best she quietly considers 
my actions. As dry warmth from the radiators 
presses my face, I remember we used to talk 
without thinking. I close my eyes to the dust 
that is everywhere on the wood floors. The 
apartment has never had a good cleaning, 
except in Lisas room and the bathroom, which 
are spotless because of her efforts. Ive been 
warned we will not live like animals.
I have never even seen an animal in this house, but at night in the summers Ive watched
the bats darting around the roof, in and out of 
the old chimney. Lisa would come out with 
beer and wed sit on the steps in front of the porch and just watch their haphazard arcs. In 
this city, which is a crusty, depressed Northern 
city, and which at times seems very much like 
the house with its old creakiness, the bats 
remind me that many animals drift about. 1 have 
seen as many animals as I did at home, I think, 
though maybe it just seems that way because 
theyre out of place. Deer wander the suburbs j 
as if they searched for a misplaced tree; rac
coons and possums do too, though I think these : 
may live in abandoned factory lots. Rabbits, 
chipmunks and snakes also exist, caught in 
islands of green and surrounded by seas of 
concrete. Sometimes they try to cross. The 
unsuccessful ones are everywhere.
I sit on the floor in shorts and a t-shirt, and : 
think that if it is a possum in the basement, Ill !
leave it there. There are few places for a good ]
possum around here. The light at the window j 
now is the February gray that precedes days 
without sun. I get up off the floor and look in ;
the refrigerator for something to feed an animal, j
Something perhaps kind of large. There is stale [ 
bread. There is also a half-eaten tub of yogurt, I 
milk on its way to becoming yogurt, an 
uncooked pork-chop which has lost its redness, li 
and other things waiting to become offensive jf 
enough to throw out. Any might be acceptable. | 
Lisa appears in the hallway in a robe and j 
slippers. You cooking breakfast today?
Not yet I've picked up the yogurt and 
stale bread. There is something in the base
ment, I say.
There are a lot of things in the basement." 
No. A thing. Something moving.
Big?"
Fairly."
She considers this a moment One month, i in the days before we went back to school, I

---------------------------------------------------

told her that I didnt knew where our rent 
check was going to come from, and that wor
ried her. For three weeks she worked overtime 
at her library job. We still wouldnt have made it 
if my father hadnt sent me some money. Lisa is 
never bothered by things she can take care of 
herself. I imagine now, that as she stands in our . 
hall with her smooth robe and matching towel, 
she is reminding herself how last night she locked the doors and carefully checked this 
house.
You should stop leaving food out, she 
says and steps into the bathroom. 1 hear the 
shower come on.
* * *
For my mothers benefit, my father said it 
was bad for us to live together. Unofficially he 
said things like, buy her something nice. I 
didnt like anything I could think of getting her, 
but as far as I know, she still has in her 
posession the nice things that I bought anyway: 
a pair of teddy bear pajamas, three poetry 
anthologies and a set of turquoise ear-rings I 
picked up in the student union, but which she 
said didnt go with anything she owned. The 
senseless all-shattering argument that we both 
anticipated has never happened and weve not 
come close. Maybe these nice things had some
thing to do with it, but then again, wed never 
really had a thing to argue about.
I search the floor for cracks into the 
basement and a place to look or listen. The 
house is sixty if it is a day, a heap of old, settling 
brick, and I especially couldnt argue with Lisa 
when she said it was probably rotting right out 
from under us. We rented it almost two years 
ago from a bent old man who smelled of moth 
balls. We only saw him twice. Once to see it Once to sign the papers. We used to send a
rent check to an address outside town. For 
several months now we have sent separate 
checks for our separate halves of this obligation. 
The lease is up in July. It is too early to make 
plans but we are both sure that by the time it 
gets real warm again, we will be wherever we 
want
After looking all around the kitchen, I 
decide that in the floor at least, there are no 
holes. Drafts that come from no where, but no 
holes. I go to the living room and consider 
moving furniture. The sofa is solid and station
ary. There are boxes of books here that also 
deny moving. I used to pick them up from yard 
sales and friends and from libraries that more or 
less give them away. They're old dusty tomes: 
criticisms, essays, outdated geography books 
and almanacs, which I am reminded are not 
practical and are mostly still in the boxes that I 
will have to move. 1 collect them and have to 
admit 1 will probably never read them. Weve 
set lamps and family pictures on them, so I guess 
now theyre furniture. Lisas collecting extends 
only to sweaters. Pushing the boxes aside, I 
think that admittedly sweaters are more practi
cal, and a lot easier to move.
Next to one of the boxes is a small split, 
extending from a nail in the floorboard. I give 
the box a shove and it moves enough to show a 
good-sized hole. Impractical, (think as I peer 
into it, is the summer after the rat incident, 
when I collected animals. I had an ant farm, a 
hamster, and a goldfish All that summer I 
watched them moving in their glass containers. 
The wild creatures were better. I caught liz
ards, beedes and insects without names. I fed 
them and cleaned their cages and knew that 
without me they would not live. Some didnt 
anyway. I had a particularly bad time with 
insects.
I rap sharply on the floor until my knuckles 
sting and I wait to hear some stirring or move

---------------------------------------------------

ment There is nothing but the spatter of water 
in the shower.
I have not bothered to explain an animal 
collection to Lisa. I think that maybe I shouldthat there are occasional successes and occa
sional failures in such things. Part of the animal 
collection was a frog I caught, which ended up 
not working out well, though you wouldnt think so at first. I caught It as a tadpole in a tire rut 
on a road near our house. There were hun
dreds of them: swimming peppercorns waiting 
to be dried up in the sun. I took most of them 
in a bucket across three fields and four barbed 
wire fences to a nearby pond, and then found a 
vinegar bottle on a trash heap for the remaining 
ones. This jar was on my desk the entirety of 
that summer. Most of the tadpoles died, but the one last frog remained, and I fed it and 
watched it grow legs, feeling triumphant My 
mother never thought it was healthy, but she 
never said that, and I think my father had had a 
say in the fact she didnt.
Hey! I yell at the floor, trying to provoke 
some reaction down there. I am viewing a thin 
line of crumbling concrete floor from a height of 
eight feet. I expect something to look up at me, 
but there is nothing. In the bathroom, the water 
begins to slow. The dull spatter becomes a 
trickle, and a gurgle and chugging of plumbing. I 
think that in this house at tills moment there 
are creatures listening for other creatures to 
make a sound. In this quiet, one sound from the 
basement is left. This one is familiar, regulara 
solid thing left after the end of the shower, as 
things are left when water withdraws from a 
shore. Now, Lisa begins whistling in the bath
room and the solid sound from below breaks 
through in rhythmic fragments only.
I put on old tennis shoes and think that I 
am not too particular about what I hope to find 
In the basement. Maybe even something a little viscious, and I chuckle at the thought of a
badger. I dont know what Lisa would say to 
that I hope, at least, that it's not a bird, be
cause when theyre in a house, they seem always 
on the verge of breaking something inside them. 
They are crushed with the weight of being 
confined. Occasionally birds would fall down 
our chimney at home, and my father would take 
apart the stove pipe to let them into the house, 
opening all the doors and windows, even in the 
middle of October. And if he wasnt home, Id 
listen to the hollow sound of the chirps in the 
dark inside of the wall, and I would go outside 
to play, hoping he'd get home soon and do 
something about it
I move through the kitchen to the rear 
entrance, stopping once at the refrigerator. I go 
out our back door, into a square room just big 
enough for the doors on all sides. One is 
boarded up and another one is pretty battered. 
The first goes upstairs, the second leads outsijde. 
I think that something could push through this 
second one if it wanted, though maybe there is a 
broken window, or maybe the rusty tin on the 
coal shoot finally gave way. I push through the 
third door and pull the string on the fly-specked 
bulb over the top stair, dismissing the thought 
of creatures blindly colliding with me. 1 hope the 
animal will be still, and wonder what is the best 
means to pin something so that it can be re
moved from a basement.
On either side of the stair are boxes, 
stacked to the dark ceiling rafters. They make a 
wall I cant see around. Most of what is here 
has been left by other people. There is a weight 
set with cheap plastic weights and a wobbly 
bench. There are several boxes of styrofoam 
peanuts. There is a shelf full of green copper 
pipe that is maybe worth something. There are 
lots of old clothes in plastic marked 'One Hour 
Martinizing. And everywhere there is the smell 
of moist dust, which prevents me from stirring 
things up more than I have to. Somewhere here,

---------------------------------------------------

too, are the boxes Lisa and I added when we 
moved, now indistinguishable from anything else 
in the basement. I wonder a little what anony
mous parts of my life are boxed up here that I 
haven't missed at all.At the bottom of the stairs, I listen care
fully and step round the wall of boxes. Across 
the room is a narrowed pair of eyes. They are 
nearly six feet off the floor, embedded in a 
heavy dark form leaned against the drier. I am 
waiting to find myself speaking. I am surprised 
when I do not There is a long silence.
Do you know schirl? says the form. The 
words are thick and slow. They combine with 
the sounds of the basement The drier I heard 
upstairs, but which hadnt registered as the drier 
in my mind, creaks as it rocks back and forth. Next to the washers are great tin basins, where 
water courses in a slow spattering stream from 
the faucet down a line of green chalk. I have 
never been able to shut it off all the way. I find 
myself thinking that I drink this water.
Schirl?" I ask.
Yes. He smiles as if I have acknowledged 
I do know schirl. The teeth are incandescent 
yellow. The only bright thing in the room.
Schirl. No, what are you talking about?"
Up the street. There is a house.
Scharl Street? There is a South 
Albemarle.'" I know this is not what he wants.
Shurrr-ullllll," he says patiently.
Sheryl? No. No Sheryl here. Wrong 
number, 1 say, as if I were going to try to hang 
up. This is 5218. He is still here. What 
number do you need?
Numbers are beyond him. Sheryl lives 
near here, and that is the end of the informa
tion. I am a little afraid for the first time. He is 
looking at the floor. I have some clothes 
here," he says.
Yes?You know. Id like to be washed up."
Youd like to be washed-up?" A pause. 
She lives on this street? On Fifth?"
Yes. I need to see her. He is shifting 
around. The grayness outside filters through 
weeds and the dusty basement windows. The 
room will be a bit brighter soon. I do not want 
to see the man in more light He is stripped to 
the waist, showing a dull, thick body. His hair is 
short His chest and belly are covered with hair that lies flat against the skin.
The dryer vent doesnt send all the air 
outside. There is beginning to be a warm wet 
smell of detergent and bleach, it is hard enough 
to think. Even so, there are no good questions 
to ask. I know how he got in, why he is here, 
and that everyone wants clean clothes. We 
stand there a long time as he waits for me to set 
each question aside. There is a big dent in a 
leaky beanbag near the freezer. The freezer 
motor kicks in and begins whirring as if some
thing inside it will fly apart It does this periodi
cally.
All night? I ask, nodding toward the bean
bag.
Most I been quiet
Another long silence. I would embarrass 
him by asking if he tried the lock on the upstairs 
door. Lisa keeps all the locks on it She checks 
these things before she sleeps.
They's some things down here thatre 
antiques," he says cheerfully. Some of them 
bottles." He points to a heap by the freezer. 
Some ceramic fireplace tiles over in that cor
ner. I think that he knows very well what is in 
this basement Say, he says, you dont know 
anyone needs something built?
No. You are a builder?
I can build things."
I dont want to tell him I do not know a single person in this neighborhood.
Can you fix that? I point to the rattling 
freezer. He stares at it and I think that he is

---------------------------------------------------

not sure. He thinks he might try. Then he 
shakes his head. It is not worth waiting here.
He turns the handle on one of the big 
basins that have only cold water in their faucets. 
He splashes himself and grabs a handful of 
laundry detergent. He smears it across his 
body. His skin becomes gray.
We got soap upstairs. Towels. Let me get them.
No. No. This is fine." He is in a half turn, 
so that he can see both me and the faucets.
Ill leave. Dont need nothing. Say, though, 
whatcha got in your hand there?"
In my hand I have a quart of sour milk and 
a half-eaten tuna sandwich that is at least a week 
old.
You dont want this, " I say. He is looking 
at my hand and I say, You know what I 
thought?
Im not picky," he says. Lemme have it.
"Let me go upstairs and make you some
thing nice."
Im leaving," he says, as if Ive just insistedon it
Look, stay as long as you want. I dont 
care. Its not even my house.
Let me have the sandwich and Ill leave. I 
might as well not even been here before you 
come down. Id stay if you didnt know. THEN, 
maybe. But you do know.
I heard you. I say. When I was upstairs 
it sounded like...
Gimme the sandwich/'
No. Ill be back. Just hold on a second."
He turns full around toward me. His 
fingers have made lines of gritty detergent soap 
all over his chest. We stand there a very long 
time. His eyes become thin, thin slits and he 
begins clenching his fists.
Ill get you something good," I say, backing 
over to the stairs.
"I had to go," he says suddenly. But I
should have never left. She said she wouldnt 
wait Man, I wouldnt be in this fix. I thought 
she would. I had to go.
I shake my head, and think very hard of 
something to say to him. Maybe you both were 
very different, I think, but that is nothing to say 
to a man in his position. Sometimes it is hard to 
talk to people. I'm not sure if he is looking at me 
or not Ill be back," I tell him and go up the 
wood planks of the steps.
I am more uneasy when I am upstairs. He 
will not come into the kitchen. He will not even 
come to the upstairs door. 1 do not know anyone named Schirl or Sheryl. There Is a 
checkout person at the grocery store on Thurs
day evenings named Shirley. I am tempted to 
mention it Maybe I will. I think of telling Lisa, 
but she will want to call the cops. Convincing 
her not to would take a lot of time. I imagine 
that Sheryl said shed be still living in this city, 
but maybe it was Philadelphia and if it's been a 
long time, maybe the roads look different, 
anyway. Its been a long time since the war 
where I figure he got the tattoo that looks like a 
bruise on his arm, and people move around, so 
who knows where anything or anyone is any
more. The country is just too damn big. It 
leaves a lot of unused places to go, at least, but 
it makes it easy to lose things.
I cannot think of an easy way to show her 
what is in the basement Lisa holds that our 
absence of means is our greatest sin, which is 
how we came to be here. Without a doubt I 
think, sniffing the lunchmeat Ive found in the 
refrigerator, it is how the man in the basement 
came to be here. Weve all so much in com
mon, I say. At the time, living here was at the 
top of a short list of choices. We were too tired 
to wait for other prospects. Then the string of 
events we originally anticipated ended after 
three months. Shed said, 'We could get en
gaged if things go as far as we expect, and when

I didnt answer right away I could tell wed 
already lost something. Since then, she says o...J 
in a non-collective way. She means, us two, 
each of us. We are both done with school in 
June. In four months I will have a company 
car, she sometimes says now. She will pauie 
after this. Is there anything more to say!
There isnt, and I keep making sandwiches.I hear creaking and shifting beneath the 
floor boards and the slow rattling clunk of 
rotating wheels stopping. I wonder how lon^ 
the doors upstairs have been boarded and hew 
many of the doors of our anonymous neighbor;, 
he tried until he opened ours, or maybe he 
remembers something about this house in 
particular. Maybe he used to live here and work 
at the mills. I would like to ask him. Down
stairs, things are very quiet I pack a brown by 
with raisins. I am moving quickly to find bread.
I want to go downstairs and ask if he prefers 
mustard or mayo. This is ridiculous, I think. I 
make one with each. It is too quiet to go and 
speak to him. His impatience to go extends like 
the basement noises up the stairs.
I open the door to the entry way and put 
the brown bag on the landing by the door, jusc 
waiting.
The basement of the house opens into a 
narrow cobblestone drive leading to the aban
doned garage in back. Weeds grow up high and 
thick between the stones and at the edges 
against the house, and the sounds of the street 
echo up. The landlord is supposed to cut the 
grass. Maybe our landlord is ill. He doesnt 
have things fixed anymore. He is supposed to 
fix this outside door, which has never worked 
too well. Because he doesnt come by, I have
piled up a number of beer bottles and think that 
when he mows the grass in the summer for the 
next tenant he may hit the botdes and send it 
out in a green shower of shards. I think it 
would be an interesting thing to see.
At lunch, I take a beer from the refrigera
tor, step through the entryway, and open the 
door into this driveway. It is cool and gray here 
on the concrete doorstep. The bag was on the 
floor where I left it, in the rear entry way 
surrounded by busted old doors. I eat the warm 
baloney sandwiches myself, sitting on the step 
and puzzling whether I missed the man in the 
basement or if he waited silently for me to go 
away. There are crazy people in the world who 
would poison a man trying to do his laundry. He 
may have thought 1 was one of them. I cannot 
feel insulted. Some things silently take without 
you watching, embarrassed only if they are 
caught, and there are others that wait in parks 
for what is handed to them on the ground. My 
father told me only spoiled things will let you 
feed them.
After lunch I ask Lisa if she knows if we've 
got a hammer, and she doesnt even ask why I 
want one and just says, 'Well if we do, you had 
it last
I look in the basement for an hour and find 
a crowbar. I take it to the boarded door in the 
rear entry that leads to the upstairs. 1 jam the 
end of the bar into the dry wood of the 
doorframe and it strains against the metal, 
cracking and squealing as I pull it around. I push 
it again and again. Screws give way. Wood 
splinters. I push the door over and there are 
stairs to the next floor up, a place for future 
transients. I put the crowbar back in the base
ment, noticing that for the first time in two 
years, the water in the basin is stopped. 1 go 
back into the living room, and flick on a baseball 
game on our little black and white, where I sit 
until it gets dark.

---------------------------------------------------

* * *
"Were just living in a big people trap, Lisa 
says. She smiles weakly.
I'm not kidding, I say. There was a man 
in our basement.
What kind of man? she asks.
A lost one.
Well that would figure, too.
We are eating dinner in our kitchen. It is 
two weeks since the man came and went and 
Lisa wants me to talk about the doorway up
stairs. It is the first thing in our lives in a long 
time that we've let affect us both.
Did you save us from him? she asks. 
"From the man? No. Though you could say 
I frightened him off."
She gets up from the kitchen table and goes 
to the door. She opens it and blinks at the 
broken door to the apartments above. "Are you 
going to fix that?
No. If someone wants to come in the 
house they can go upstairs.
Someone could come in anytime, then. 
Thats so. You never know who youre 
sharing the people trap with.
* * *
July. The land lord has come by at last and 
he and I are clearing out the basement. There 
are many things here I didnt know about 
camping equipment, four cases of returnable 
Coke bottles, a cheap croquet and lawn dart 
set, the latter of which I am told is now illegal in 
many states. And in one corner a half empty 
bottle of bourbon that could have been here a 
long time.
He says he thought I was living with some 
girl. I say that she moved out some time ago. I 
do not say that the last months were not so 
bad. I finally told Lisa the whole story about 
the man who was looking for Sheryl, and ended 
up in our basement She didnt believe it at all 
at first, though shed been waiting for me to 
mention itDid you tell him she wasnt there? shed : 
asked. He came all this way to look for her?
I dont know if he came a long way or ,
not
Thats sweet
Lisa and I went upstairs to the floors 
above, which were big and empty and swept 
clean of all but the finest layer of dust. We left , 
the door wrecked, and it is still wrecked. Once 
or twice we sat on the creaky wood floors in 
these big empty apartments eating dinner off  
paper plates. We would talk about lighting a 
fire in the old brick fireplaces, or speculate on 
the people who had lived there before and who 
never left clues to who they were. Our own
fire place on the first floor had been bricked up I11long ago, and the wood floors mostly overlaid j 
with cheap foam and carpet, except in the 
kitchen and living room. Then I would say 
something about the bats circling way above 
outside and wed both grow silent
The more questions she asked me, the ? 
more answers I made up, and I wasnt fooling 
her. It was worth it just to be talking. I never 
told her, though, 1 thought I saw the man in the: \ 
basement again in April, in Cincinnati, wearing a 1 
sweater of hers that used to be my favorite. I j 
was on a two-hour stop between buses and was j 
wandering around near the waterfront, where 
the giant concrete steps slope off toward the 
river and where they have that statue of 
Cincinnatus, the Roman soldier-citizen. The 
man in the sweater was slumped in the doorway 
of a laundromat not too far from there, and

---------------------------------------------------

I I in

though I had time to kill I didnt try to wake him 
or talk to him, or even go near enough to him 
to see his face. I think now, maybe, that Lisa 
would have wanted me to.
o
My landlord is asking me if I want any of 
these things. I say that maybe I want the green 
bottle by the freezer, which reminds me of that 
frog I kept In the bottle that summer. I tell him 
how it got so big that there was no way I could 
get it out of the bottle.
He says, well, what did you do with it? 1 
say that I took it to a bridge and threw it off, 
and then he asks me why I didnt just bust the 
bottle open and I tell him, well I figured Id 
probably slice that frog wide open. He tells me, 
well you know I saw a thing on the news where 
all these frogs were living in Florida somewhere, 
and Christ, they were so thick on the ground 
you couldnt do a thing about them except stand 
still. It was like a plague or something. And 
these people were driving around in cars like it 
wasnt nothing. Hell, he says, I must have cut 
up a million of them in my lawnmower.
So I am in this basement, and the landlord, 
who still smells of moth balls, chatters on and on 
about how he wanes to sell this place and maybe a 
developer will come through and tear the damn 
thing down.
I sit on a box of styrofoam peanuts and I am 
thinking how I took that bottle to an.abandoned 
railroad bridge. I went to the center of the 
bridge, with the corked up vinegar bottle in my
left hand and the frog flapping up and down 
against the glass. I uncorked it and chucked it far 
out downstream, where it met the water with a 
large clunk, disappeared, resurfaced for a moment, 
and then settled into a floating knot, bobbing up 
and down.
I stand and I think about how, when I was 
little, I never wanted to leave the farm and never 
wanted to live in a city; I was sure that there 
would always be a place for me somewhere in the 
world, so that I wouldn't have to stay anywhere 
too bad for too long. And I am debating whether 
I should tell the bent landlord about the bottles in 
the yard or not. I never told Lisa what happened 
to the half dozen sweaters she lost. I never told 
my father about a bite I got from a dog the sum
mer I had all the animals and which made me turn 
them all lose for good. I also never told the 
landlord why the upstairs door was knocked in, 
and though he didnt give any indication, 1 think he 
is glad I didnt pester him about getting it fixed.

Volume 86, Issue 18The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania24 February 1992
Professor
pens story 
collection
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
According to the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, hes a deft 
writer who lightens even the 
tensest scenes with humor. He 
has published six novels, a mem
oir, and two collections of short 
stories. The second collection 
Success, his most recent book, is 
appearing in bookstores this 
month. But when Hilary Mas
ters is asked if he considers him
self successful as a writer, he 
answers promptly, No.
A big man with a gruff voice, 
deeply lined face, and unruly 
gray hair, Masters is a bit in
timidating at first, especially 
with his disconcerting knack for 
catching people off guard with 
unexpected comments or obser
vations. He sits comfortably in 
an office equipped with an oftused, manual typewriter.
Masters works as an associate 
professor of English at CMU, 
and heads the creative writing 
program. In addition to the books 
hes published, his work has 
appeared in various literary 
quarterlies. Theres no way to 
write the perfect poem, book^or 
story. It just doesnt happenjjo 
one is never really successful. 
Every morning I start from the 
beginning, he says.
The title of his new book didnt 
come from his feelings toward 
his career, as might at first 
seem logical. It came from a story 
in the collection also titled Suc
cess. The story appeared origi
nally in Hammertown Tales, 
Masters first collection. It has 
been a favorite story for mea 
benchmark of a writing style 
which combines a first person,
local point of 
view with a 
more objec
tive one, using 
different ele
ments of time 
and memory.
Ivebeendeveloping a kind of 
double story, 
manipulating 
time. While 
this style can 
make for diffi
cult reading at 
first, the.mesh 
of two or even 
three stories in 
one enriches 
his work.
Masters be
gan writing at 
a very early 
age  some
time in grade 
school. He 
says that from 
reading, he be
came inter
ested in writ' mg.
I was read\ 
ing books that 
were probably 
too old for me
 books from 
my fathers or 
. Iny grandfathers library. It just 
occurred to me that it would be 
fun to do that too, to write a 
.story. The earliest story he re
members writing? It was about 
a robin who came back too early 
[in spring], and it got cold, and 
the robin froze. A tragedy.
His father was Edgar Lee 
Masters, reknowned author of 
Spoon River Anthology, which 
told the stories of the lives of
townspeople from a small, 
midwestem town called Spoon 
River. Surprisingly, Masters 
says his father had no influence 
on him as an author.
I never even knew my father 
was a writer until, oh, about 
halfway through high school. I 
knew he did something with 
words, but I didnt know exactly 
what. Naturally, Masters wants 
to be judged on his own work,
rather than seen simply as the 
son of. The name of Edgar Lee 
Masters rarely comes up in his 
sons life, it seems, except in 
interviews.
Masters began teaching at 
CMU in 1983. Amongthe classes 
he teaches and has taught are 
an autobiography class, Survey 
of Forms: Fiction, and Fiction 
Workshop. Very rarely does he 
show any of his work to his stu
dents. He 
says wryly, 
Theyre 
kind of a 
captive aud i e n c e , 
arent they? 
Theyll say, 
Oh, yeah, 
thats won
derful.  
However, I 
would like 
them to 
read [my 
work]its 
in the li
brary here
 I just 
dontassign 
it.
In his 
time here, 
Masters 
has been 
impressed 
with the 
students 
hes taught. 
For some 
reason, this 
English De
partment 
attracts 
very high
quality un,1 Frey/Tartan Art Editor dergradu.
ates. They would match up very 
well to the best graduate pro
grams. Theyre very driven, and 
most of them have good discipline. I enjoy the classes very 
much.
Masters likes teaching survey 
classes best, because everyones 
more excited and interested, and 
they dont come to it with a perceivedsense ofwhat they should 
be doing. He perceives a change
in student writing between his 
first years here and now, which 
he attributes primarily to 
changes in what students read. 
Theyre more comfortable with 
fantasy; theres less realism.
His own writing has changed 
as well, he says. During his ten
ure here, hes developed his 
double story style. Since Ive 
been here, Ive become more con
fident. A theme of abandonment 
unites the stories inSueeess, says 
Masters, and it is one he keeps 
returning to in his writing. Its 
about different kinds of aban
donment that take place  ei
ther people being abandoned, or 
abandoning other people, or leav
ing their place and disappear
ing.
In a larger sense, he says, I 
think of myself as a critic of 
society in a lot of ways. Society 
disappoints him. I think the 
leadership weve had in the last
10 or 15 years has been abys
mal. Its been mediocre minds 
that have been about evil tasks.
When asked about political 
correctness, he says he hasnt 
seen much evidence of it as an 
orthodoxy people are trying tc 
impose here. While the phrase 
is used often, he believes thats 
because its a chic thing. I have 
never been aware of any sup
pression like that here.
As for his personal philoso
phy, Masters says, You have to 
be truthful, an honest human 
being, honest to yourself and to 
others. He believes in a social 
contract that he sees ignored, 
abused, or forgotten too often. 
Tou have to follow where your 
heart leads you, he says, and 
be honest  if youre not honest 
with yourself, what can you do?
Students use energy, resources to make films
By LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Prom documentaries to com
edy skits to computer anima
tion, filmmaking requires much 
more time and creativity than 
one might think. The Carnegie 
Mellon Filmmaking Club, un
der the aus
pices of presi
dent Paul Maya 
Mid vice presi
dent Kate Rollenhagen, is in 
the midst of orianizing 
Aprils First 
Annual Film 
Festival, and 
Maya empha
sizes creativity 
as one of the 
main ingredients for a good 
homemade film.
Filmmaking allows for a lot of 
creativity and improvisation on 
the part of the filmmaker. First, 
a filmmaker must choose which 
type of film to make  a docu
mentary, narrative, or anima
tion.
A documentary is a film usu
ally about some historical event 
that requires much time and
research to complete. Maya, a 
sophomore in H&SS, and junior 
mechanical engineer John 
Walsh and Alex Henry are pres
ently working on a documen
tary about the U.S.S. Requin, a 
submarine which was made for 
World War II and which is now 
on permanent exhibit at the Car
negie. For 
the 
project, 
the trio 
has gone 
through 
archives 
and found 
several 
original 
members 
of the 
boats 
crew to in
terview and travelled as far as 
Groton, Connecticut, to exam
ine working submarines. Walsh, 
a Naval ROTC cadet, has also 
used some ROTC archive sources 
for information on the boat.
Maya, who cross-registered 
for a filmmaking class at Pitts
burgh Filmmakers last semes
ter, says, Carnegie Mellon 
doesnt have a filmmaking de
partment on campus  you re5pE0NpE
ally have to do it on your own 
but we did get a Small Under
graduate Research Grant from 
[CMU]. Maya says, They have 
a video 
editing 
cluster in 
CFA, and 
Instruct i o n a 1 
Technol
ogy has 
let us use 
some of 
their 
lighting 
and mi
crophone 
equip
ment.
And The 
Carnegie 
has been 
very sup
portive of all of our work.
Heniy, another of May as team 
members, has undertaken a 
filmmaking project of his own. 
Working with volunteer actors 
and composers, hes making a 
dramatic skit video for an inde
pendent study in filmmaking.
Junior English Mike Gabriel, 
production manager for ABs 
Thursday nightmovie series, has
A lot of people who take Film 
1 and 2 dont get any chance to 
show their projects, Gabriel ex

them to be seen.
Senior math and computer 
science major Scott Pakin has 
also tried some amateur filmmakingwith a twist. With the 
help of senior math and com
puter sci

and Drew 
Olbrich,
Pakin has 
written a

Starting 
with a vid

add reverberations, echoes, 
backwards messages and syn

sounds.
Olbrich then wrote customized

amateur filmmaking, and will 
show some of his work in the 
Film Festival. Its an informal
sort of way to show completed 
works and works still in 
progress, he said. Gabriel, who 
has taken Film 1 and Film 2 at 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers and is 
taking H&SS film studies mi
nor, thought of the student film

Gabriel wanted to show a short 
student film before each Thurs

then extracted characters and 
used computerized gif pictures 
from the computer to create a 
scene full of characters that could 
move and interact.

Maya emphasizes, 
Filmmaking takes a 
lot of time. You have 
to be dedicated  
but its fun.
He encourages budding art

In the past year, the recycling 
effort at Carnegie Mellon has 
increased drastically; for ex
ample, paper recycling is up from 
47 tons in 1990 to 150 tons in 
1991. The push for recycling 
began when the Pennsylvania 
government passed a law that 
stated that institutions must 
recycle cardboard, office paper, 
aluminum cans, and leaf waste. 
CMU has gone past that man
date by starting voluntary glass 
recycling as well.
At this time, a program started 
by Environmental Health and 
Safety employs several people 
from a local rehabilitation cen
ter to help collect aluminum cans 
from academic areas. This pro
gram benefits both the Univer
sityby assisting the recycling 
process  and the rehabilitat
ing employeesby giving them 
a job opportunity in the Univer
sity atmosphere.
There are many other recy
cling programs that involve the 
community. The city of Pitts
burghs curbside recycling pro
gram, also available to the cam
pus community, is currently ac
cepting plastics, including both 
Polyethylene Terephthalate 
(PET) type containers (i.e. two 
liter soda bottles) and High Den
sity Polyethylene (HDPE) type 
containers (i.e. milk and deter
gent jugs). In addition, a report 
was put out by Carnegie Mellon 
students to local businesses on 
the benefits of recycling paper. 
This type of service is a way to 
close the loop in the commu
nity, says Campus Safetys 
Environmental Health and Re
cycling Coordinator Barbara 
Kviz.
Voluntary glass recycling is 
also available on campus, al
though no program to collect the 
recyclable glass has been estab
lished, except on some dormi
tory floors by residents. There 
are presently eleven facilities to 
recycle glass, including stations 
at Donner, Morewood Gardens, 
Hamerschlag House, Mudge, 
and in the fraternity quadrangle, 
as well as near all major aca
demic buildings. Lids and metal 
rings should be removed and 
glass of different colors sepa
rated, but labels may remain on 
the bottles. Wean Hall has even 
initiated its own volunteer glass 
recycling program which is not 
affiliated with the University 
program. Dining Services in 
Skibo and Morewood will also 
collect clear glass waste gener
ated in the dining areas.
Cardboard recycling is also oc
curring in all offices and dining 
facilities on campus. Unwaxed 
corrugated cardboard boxes need 
to be flattened and taken to the 
drop off stations behind Physi
cal Plant or Mellon Institute,
Concious Efforts.. 
A look at the benevolent 
forces in our community
but large quantities will be 
picked up by Physical Plant. 
Packing materials need to be 
removed, but tape, staples, and 
plastic labels may be left on the 
boxes.
Currently, recycling bins are 
located in all offices and clusters 
across campus for paper and alu
minum cans, while cans are the 
main focus in the dormitories. 
All office paper is recycled, in
cluding colored paper, greeting 
cards, Post-it notes, and manilla 
folders. Presently only beverage 
cans are being recycled, but 
plans are being made for the 
recycling of scrap metals and 
steel/tin food cans. This years 
Carnival is another place where 
recycling will be stressed. The 
waste from building the booths 
will be reduced by recycling.
The help of all students and 
faculty is necessary if recycling 
is to continue being successful 
on campus. Kviz hopes that 
people will respond to updates 
and information on new recy
cling programs. She andher staff 
are trying to do their part by 
making recycling easier for ev
eryone. In the future, Kviz hopes 
to expand campus recycling to 
include wood, batteries, oil, and 
oldfumiture. Kviz notes, though, 
that it will take a campus-wide 
effort to make recycling a com
plete success.

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Thursday art historian 
and writer Lucy Lippard pre
sented a lecture entitled To
wards a Post-Columbian Soci
ety Multiculturalism in the 
Arts, as part of the Presidents 
Distinguished Lecture Series 
and co-sponsored by the Art De
partment Lecture Series. The 
talk focused on the next 500 
years, which start today.
She first mentioned that this 
year the Western world is cel
ebrating the quintcentennial of 
Christopher Columbus acci
dental invasion of the Americas 
and the unleashing of modem 
colonialism... For Native Ameri
cans this is like celebrating 
Hitlers birthday or the bomb
ing of Hiroshima....
The story of Columbus that 
has been officially told and re
told features the arrival of [Eu
ropean] civilizations, in a land 
supposedly unowned by hun
dreds of native ... inhabitants 
and thus rightly, inevitably hav
ing the march of progress come 
stomping across it.
This official story ignores the 
genocides, the rapes, the injus
tices, and the sufferings that 
occured and still are occuring 
along this march. The oblitera
tion of 98 percent of the original 
population of the hemisphere 
through conventional warfare, 
ecological destruction, uncon
scious and conscious biological 
warfare are pictured as unfortu
nate side effects.
Ironically, it has been the 
[Native Americans] egalitarian
ism and generosity  traits 
much admired in the Euro-culturethat doomed them to the

land or cultural rights are mini
mized. I dont think its far
fetched to say that the art that 
shows unseen images and tells 
the unheard stories and called 
up new responses to old 
canonballs can effect the history 
of the next 500 years. Not alone 
of course, but is the envisioning 
branch of a new consciousness 
of who we are and how we got 
here.
As we examine our own cul
tural origins and mixtures, we 
learn of a peoples history in the 
U.S.... When we understand who 
we are in the historical sense 
then we are in a far better posi
tion to understand what other 
cultural groups are experienc
ing in the time and place we all 
share, because all of our lives 
intertwine, sometimes serenely 
and sometimes disastrously, but 
always vitally.
According to Lippard, an his
torian once said, What Europe
ans discovered is the totality of
which they are a part, whereas 
hitherto they formed a part with
out a whole ... [Many people act 
as] independent parts ignorant 
of the whole, and therefore, not 
whole. A Mexican scholar once 
stated, America had to be in
vented because its explorers 
were reluctant to discover it.
1992 rates as amatrix of com
plex issues about contemporary 
representation  about how 
people in this hemisphere are 
pictured and seen, not only the 
indigent people in the Ameri
cas, Hawaii or the Philippines, 
but also the abducted and en
slaved populations of Africa and 
everyone driven by Europe and 
Asia by the Industrial Revolu
tion....
Falseidentities or stereotypes 
have led women, gays, lesbians 
and people of color to an obses
sion of self-definition, self-naming, and self-determination, with 
a re-creation of identity and 
therefore history from the inside-out instead of from the top. 
down. We are all still struggling 
for the right to be perceived aj 
subjects of history acting in it 
rather than the objects being 
acted upon.
Theres an assumption that 
the white people in our countij 
have lost our culture and doni 
need one anymore. Those wht 
think we have lost our culturs 
have in fact accepted the status 
quo, which is the dominant 
culture. All of us should be work
ing together, whites included, 
while maintaining what is im
portant to all of us in our cuiturai background.

Fridges arouse old folks
I have fits the minute I see 
Geraldo or Mr. Belvedere come 
across the TV screen, although 
; now that my reception is too bad 
to get Charles in Charge, I feel a 
little better. I dont watch often, 
but when I do turn on the televi
sion, I usually irritate the people 
with me until they dont ever, 
ever want to watch anything, 
even goldfish, with me again. Id 
rbeen doing reasonably well 
! lately, though, and not making 
any more enemies. Watching 
television by yourself with a big 
jar of peanut butter or maybe a 
bag full of Charleston Chews 
helps you keep friends. Well, the 
other day I slipped up. I watched 
TV without a gag in my mouth 
and the neighbors threatened to 
call my landlord.
I actually didnt start yelling 
the second the commercial came 
on, but by the end of its thirtieth 
viewing, I had spit up most of 
my vital organs and a little pea 
soup. It was a commercial about 
kitchen appliances and the ease 
and joy they bring to our mun
dane, everyday, middle-class 
lives. It didnt start out any more 
inane than the usual youll-beever-so-happy-with-the-perfecttoast-our-Toast-O-Maticmakes-that-youll-never-go-toMickey-Ds-for-breakfast-againand-youll-have-a-better-sexlife-too. So what was so unusual? 
This commercial targeted older 
people who we all know have the 
extra fixed-income bucks to 
spend on a dishwasher sturdy 
enough to handle the exotic toys 
generated by those swinger par
ities we know they all have. In 
itself, this wasnt that bad. What 
really killed me was the last 
shot of the commercial. Two older 
people whod just spent a truck
load of money redoing their 
kitchen were dancing a waltz, in 
the middle of the night, in golden 
light pouring out through the 
new fridges open door. I know 
at least one of them must have 
told someone, somewhere, along 
.the line not to leave the refrig
erator door open. Is this a real
ity break or what? I mean really,

SCREAMING INTO...

dancing while the door is open?
I have a small sentimental side 
too. I think its very romantic 
that two older people were danc
ing in the middle of the night in 
their kitchen. They get up for a 
midnight snack and then get 
that look in their eyes. Its that 
look that they havent forgotten 
the meaning of even at age sev
enty. I hope that if I reach sev
enty, Ill still have the energy to 
dance with someone I love. Fa

erotic the kitchen could be, al
though I dont think any bun
nies were going to get boiled in 
the new Salad Master crockery.
However, I refuse to believe 
that someones romantic juices 
are stimulated because theres a 
new refrigerator in the kitchen. 
How erotic is a refrigerator any
way? Granted the device is tech
nically phallicits longer than 
it is wide  but it makes ice 
cubes (in themselves not the 
most stimulating of substances).

enty and I get turned on to my 
wife because weve got a new 
refrigerator, I hope she shoots 
me. I will not have just gone over 
the hill, Ill have gone completely 
around the bend. Celebrating our 
love by dancing in front of the 
open door of our new refrigerator 
seems a little drafty, too. I mean 
the whole reason for your mother 
telling you not to leave the re
frigerator door open is because 
cold air gets out. It probably looks 
just like those high school dry ice 
experiments where the chilly 
vapor sinks to floor in horrormovie clouds. Well, there are 
some pretty old bare feet danc
ing around there on the linoleum 
and it strikes me that its pretty 
cool after the refrigerator  
which can take water from sixty 
to thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit 
in three-point-two secondshas 
been open for a while.
So what are appliance compa
nies trying to tell us? Are new 
refrigerators the erotic toys of 
the future? Will ice-boxes be ad
vertised like Close-Up toothpaste 
 you know, the ads where ev
eryone is sucking face  in the 
years to come?
Maybe the appliance section 
in the Sears catalog is the an
swer for personal ads. Just send 
in a picture of your big refrigera
tor and see who gets turned on.

Carnegie Mellon sheds some light on campus security
Theres no reason to be in the dark about campus security. A team of Carnegie Mellon police officers, security guards, and housing and student affairs staff members 
work to keep students, faculty, staff and visitors informed and safe on the campus and adjacent areas. These professionals who are concerned with the safety and 
welfare of the campus community are best able to answer questions about campus security.
Campus Security Staff
How many police officers are on campus?
Twenly-Iwo armed officers comprise the police staff. They are empowered to make 
an arrest on Carnegie Mellon property or any areas adjacent to the university. 
Additionally, there are 20 security guards, five radio dispatchers and two traffic 
monitors on the staff. Foot patrols by guards support the officers' surveillance of 
the campus academic buildings and residence halls.
What can the officers do in an emergency?
Officers, including three sergeants, a lieutenant and the director of security, are 
sworn and commissioned under the General Laws of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania. They are certified under Act 235 prior to duty and receive firearms 
and Emergency Medical Training. Officers also receive specialized training in 
current concerns, such as auto theft, drug awareness, crime search procedure and 
hazardous materials. Sworn officers receive their authority from Act 501 of the 
Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. The Act reads: Such policemen, so 
appointed, shall severally possess and exercise all the powers of a police officer in 
this Commonwealth, in and upon, and in the immediate and adjacent vicinity of, 
the property of the corporation." Officers are also trained under Act 120 
Municipal Police Training and Education Act.
What authority do security guards have?
While they are not sworn officers, each guard receives orientation training in such 
areas as building security, key control, procedures related to arrests by officers, 
and criminal and patrol procedures. Guards also train in specialty areas including 
medical emergencies and hazardous wastes. They assist the Campus Police in all 
of these areas.
How do the security guards supplement campus police patrols?
The guards make regular foot patrols through academic buildings and residence 
halls every night of the year. During the day, two traffic monitors also patrol 
campus parking areas.
A Safe City and Campus
What about crime in Pittsburgh?
Pittsburgh's relatively low incidence of crime, along with its educational, cultural, 
sports and geographic benefits, helped to secure its status as the most livable city 
in America. The City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Police Forces, as well as 
the Pennsylvania State Police and the FBI, are the major elements in a crimeprevention network that includes the campus police departments of all Pittsburgh 
colleges and universities. Students attending Carnegie Mellon benefit from the 
cooperative relationship Campus Police enjoys with federal, state, county and city 
police agencies.
What does this cooperation involve?
The universitys Department of Security participates with area law enforcement 
agencies in apprehending alleged criminals and in joint crime prevention 
programs, training classes, community service activities and memberships in 
mutual professional organizations.
How are crimes on campus reported and to whom?
Serious offenses, including murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, auto theft and 
arson, are reported to the City of Pittsburgh's Police Department. Campus Police 
write the incident report then register the report on the official Pittsburgh Police 
report forms at the appropriate police zone station. Once notified, the Pittsburgh 
Police investigate all major crime occurring on university property. The university 
police enlist the assistance of the city's police department should an incident 
appear likely to cross university property.
What happens when a student discovers a theft or other crime?
Reports of theft or other crimes are reported to Campus Police for investigation. 
Resident assistants are key in reporting criminal activity in the residence halls, and 
are required to keep a log of .incidents occurring during their shifts. When 
appropriate, staff from Housing or Student Affairs may be involved in answering a 
call for assistance.
What about reporting incidents outside of the residence halls?
There are 34 police emergency phones located across the campus. Without dialing, 
the caller is immediately in contact with the Campus Police Department. The 
location of the call is automatically recorded and response is immediate. Campus 
Police may also be reached by calling 268-2323, or simply 2323 on any campus 
phone.
Are firearms permitted on campus?
No. The university prohibits the possession or use of firearms, as well as any other 
weapons, in or near the residence halls, or on university property. Only sworn 
Campus Police personnel are authorized to carry weapons while on duty. While off 
duty, no member of the department is permitted to possess a weapon on campus 
property. Police training includes daylight and nighttime qualification with firearms 
training including the legal, moral and practical aspects of carrying a weapon.
Does the university consider criminal records in admissions 
or employment?
Yes, for specific job classifications, such as security personnel. The application for 
admission to Carnegie Mellon does not request information concerning any 
previous criminal convictions; consequently the criminal records of applicants for 
admission to the university are not reviewed by the Admissions Office. The univer
sity recognizes its responsibility to ensure the safety of the campus community and 
therefore evaluates an enrolled students status with the university in the event of 
his or her criminal conviction in public court.
What Is the university's disciplinary role if a student is convicted 
of a criminal offense?
The University Committee on Discipline may review the case when a student has 
been convicted in public courts of serious crimes. Special attention is given to 
circumstances which constitute a potential threat against the universitys ability to 
function in whole or in part. In such a review the committee will determine whether 
the students presence at the university will endanger the university community.
For details on the disciplinary review of students, consult the Student Handbook.
How is the campus environment maintained for safe lighting 
and walkways?
Security personnel assess the physical condition of campus facilitiesincluding 
landscaping, grounds keeping and outdoor lighting  on their regular patrols of 
university property. All security staff and members of the campus community can 
report deficient physical conditions to the universitys Physical Plant via the 
campus-wide electronic mail system or by calling Security directly.
Building Safety
How are university facilities and programs accessible to students, 
employees and guests?
As a private university, Carnegie Mellon does have the right to limit access to its 
campus and to control activities on the campus. But, in the spirit of academic 
freedom and free expression of ideas, the university permits and encourages 
freedom of speech and assembly by all persons. This includes the distribution of 
leaflets and petitions, as well as demonstrations or protests involving speaking, 
discussion or the distribution of information outside university buildings.
What restrictions apply to such activities?
The only limits on these activities are the rights of the members of the university 
community and the maintenance of the normal functioning of the university. No 
activities which harm individuals, damage or deface property, block access to 
university buildings or disrupt classes will be permitted. Public events, such as 
lectures; plays and concerts, are, of course, open to the community on a ticket or 
free admission basis.
What types of student housing are available?
Carnegie Mellon has a number of traditional residence halls with common bath 
facilities as well as a number of residence halls where there are private or semi
private baths. A number of single sex areas as well as some co-ed facilities are 
available for undergraduates. As a rule, areas may be co-ed or single sex as 
bathroom facilities permit. Also offered are a variety of apartment spaces both oncampus in university-owned buildings as well as off-campus in buildings rented 
for undergraduate housing.
How are room requests handled?
The university's housing system is basically a seniority one: with seniors choosing 
first, followed by juniors and then by sophomores. In March, upperclassmen may 
select their roommates and specific rooms in seniority order for the fall semester. 
The university traditionally assigns between 1,000 and 1,100 entering freshmen 
to available spaces. The order in which freshmen pay their deposits to the 
Admissions Office determines the order in which housing preference requests are 
honored. The university is normally able to accommodate preferences for assign
ment to single sex areas, but assignment to co-ed areas is not always possible.
Can students change rooms during the semester?
Housing assignments are virtually immutable at the beginning of the fall semester, 
but once into the academic year room change requests can be accommodated. The 
best time to make a room change is at the end of the fall semester, when the 
university traditionally has well over 100 vacancies to offer students who request 
room changes. 
How are guests admitted or identified in the residence halls?
All university buildings are locked and permit entrance only to people with keys or 
people accompanying residents v/ho have their own keys. At the three buildings 
with Iront desks, visitors are asked to present their Carnegie Mellon photo ID card. 
Other individuals are directed to the centrex telephone to call the student whom 
they are visiting to meet them at the front desk.
How are the entrances of buildings secured?
Every outside door is checked daily to ensure the entrance is functioning properly. 
The university has replaced the fire alarm system in several of our buildings, where 
the plan is to use one door as a main entrance and exit and to have the side doors 
operate only as emergency exits. All of our residence halls will soon be on a 
similar plan with only one entrance and exit. Side doors would operate only when 
a fire alarm is pulled or during a power outage or similar emergency.
What are the standard security features used in the residence halls?
Rooms in the university's residence halls are secured by the Best Locking System. 
In most cases, these locks are bolt locks which provide an optimum degree of 
security for individual rooms. When residents report keys missing or lost, or fail to 
return keys at the end of the academic year, the university quickly changes the lock 
and issues new keys to the residents. The university's procedure assures that only 
the current residents of a particular room have keys to that room. All of the first 
floor dormitory screens are security screens," constructed of a heavy mesh in 
frames attached to the window frame itself.
Who is on-duty" at the residence halls?
The university relies on the strength of its competent resident assistant (RA) staff. 
There are four full-time professional residence life administrators, called area 
coordinators, and 70 student resident assistants who live in the residence halls and 
have a variety of responsibilities for administering the halls.
How are student housing residents informed about security 
procedures and enforcement?
Via Student Affairs, the resident assistance staff is regularly informed, as is the 
campus community, of various health and safety concerns. All resident assistants 
receive an extensive week-long training session for preparation in aiding and 
advising students in all non-academic issues. Campus Police sanctioned personal 
safety practices are taught to the RAs who then advise residents through bulletin 
boards, meetings and workshops as needed, including programs to heighten 
student awareness ol personal concerns such as the dangers of drug and alcohol 
abuse and the problems of suicide and acquaintance rape. Security information 
programs are presented by security personnel to resident students at least once an 
academic year with special attention to those areas which may be experiencing 
unusual security problems, as well as off-campus rental units in locations where 
students have to walk on public streets to travel to and from campus.
Are there special security procedures during low-occupancy periods 
such as holidays and vacations periods?
During Thanksgiving break and spring break special attention is given to making 
sure that buildings stay locked and secure with extra security monitoring. During 
the winter break (from mid-December to mid-January) all but one of he residence 
facilities are locked and inaccessible by the normal residents. Morewood Gardens 
is offered as an alternative for those students who cannot travel (approximately 30 
or 40 students). Morewood Gardens is monitored via its front desk on a 24-hour 
basis. The Campus Police naturally increase their patrols of Morewood Gardens 
area during the winter breaks low occupancy period.
What is the university's policy on the housing of guests?
Generally, guests are allowed in residence hall rooms if all residents of the room 
agree to the arrangement. University policy permits students to have guests stay in 
their room for two days before obtaining permission from the Housing Office to 
allow for a longer slay. With that exception, we are not normally able to provide 
housing for guests of students or nonstudents during the academic year. Vacancies 
where they exist are only offered as permanent spaces to other undergraduates 
interested in living in university housing for the remainder of the academic year. 
The housing office can answer specific questions regarding the availability of 
accommodations for students and guests.
Safety Communications
How is the campus community informed of the security, safety 
procedures and crime prevention programs?
Campus media and publications specific to security and safety issues regularly 
carry news and information for the university community. Weekly media include 
the student newspaper, The Tartan, and The 8-1/2 x 11 News. A brochure about the 
Campus Police offers details of shuttle and escort services for students. The 
Student Handbooks updated annually and provides details about policies and 
procedures. The widely read campus computer bulletin board is also used as an 
immediate means of communication.
The Campus Watch Program
The Campus Watch Program is designed to increase the awareness of the entire 
community at Carnegie Mellon. The concept of Campus Watch includes two 
simple aims:
1. The sharing of crime information by Campus Police.
2. The involvement of the entire community in reporting suspicious activity or 
actual crime commission.
Crime Alerts
Campus Police issues alerts to the community about recently committed crimes. 
These include crimes committed on the campus as well as in the neighborhoods of 
the city surrounding the university. These alerts are issued about crime that is a 
threat to members of the campus community. Crime Alerts give as much detail as 
possible about the crime itself, as well as any description of suspects or vehicle. 
Names of victims are never included in the alerts. The alerts end with tips to avoid 
becoming a victim.
Newsletters
The Security Department publishes a monthly newsletter, the Crime Watch. The 
newsletter provides a summary of crime during the past month. It also advises the 
campus about recent crime trends such as con artists or harassing phone calls. 
Seasonal alerts will be presented to help inform the campus about expected crime. 
Specialized crime tips will be presented about topics such as how to safely use the 
Automatic Banking Machines.
Crime Prevention Education
Through the year, the Security Department's Crime Prevention Unit is available to 
present safety and security seminars in residence halls, department offices and any 
other setting both on and off campus. These seminars can be tailored to meet the 
needs of the group. The topics range from personal safety, rape prevention, resi
dence security, office security, self-defense tactics, vehicle theft and other topics. 
These seminars can be arranged by calling the Campus Police at ext. 2323.
Drugs and Alcohol
What is Carnegie Mellon's policy on alcoholic beverages and drugs?
The university's faculty, administrators and staff recognize the responsibility and 
potential harm inherent in the use of alcoholic beverages. The university is 
committed to support the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and reflects 
that support in its policies and procedures.
What is the Pennsylvania law concerning alcoholic beverages?
The Commonwealth law states that a person who is less than 21 years of age and 
who attempts to purchase, purchases, consumes, possesses or knowingly and 
intentionally transports any alcohol, liquor or malt beverages within the state 
commits a summary offense. Misrepresentation of age to a licensed dealer or other 
persons who sell or furnish intoxicating liquors constitutes a third degree misde
meanor. Likewise, a person commits a third degree misdemeanor for selling or 
providing alcoholic beverages to a known minor.
What is the policy for alcoholic beverages on campus or at 
Carnegie Mellon events?
The university follows the Commonwealths law regarding intoxicating beverages. 
Students are expected to conduct themselves both individually and collectively in a 
responsible manner. Abusive or excessive consumption of alcohol resulting in 
interference with the rights of other persons, personal injury or damage to property 
will result in severe disciplinary action. Violations of the universitys policy can 
lead to a fine imposed by the university and the possibility of suspension and 
expulsion. Planning Social Events with Alcohol: Things You Should Know\s a 
brochure that outlines the university policy on alcohol and includes a form 
outlining the responsibility involved with serving alcohol at an event. For more 
information, refer to the Student Handbook or contact Student Affairs.
What about drugs on campus?
Campus Police officers are instructed to turn over to the Narcotics Squad of the 
Pittsburgh Police any significant quantity of dangerous drugs discovered in the 
course of performing their duty. The medically unsupervised use or distribution of 
potentially harmful drugs such as marijuana, hallucinogens, amphetamines, 
barbituates and opiates is illegal and subject to very harsh penalties. While the 
university does not assume the responsibility of acting as an arm of the law, 
members of the academic community have no immunity from the enforcement of 
the law. Distribution and use of these drugs may threaten the physical and mental 
health of the user, as well as the welfare of other students and the academic 
community. The disciplinary policy of the university permits taking action beyond, 
or separate from, any which may be taken by civil authorities. Also, the university 
cannot and does not deny access to its property to law enforcement agents seeking 
to uphold the Federal and Pennsylvania Drug Laws. The Student Handbook further 
outlines Carnegie Mellon's drug policy.
This report is published in compliance with 
Pennsylvania Legislative Act 73, Section 3:
Crime Statistics Reports and Security Policies and 
Procedures, and Federal Public Law 101-542, Title li, 
Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990.

Winter Olympics coverage smothers regular programming
For the past two weeks, I, with 
the rest of America, have en
dured the seemingly endless cov
erage of the Winter Olympics 
from Albertville. Day after day 
on TNT and night after night on 
. CBS, regular programming has 
been interrupted to bring us 
. taped coverage of speed skating, 
bobsled racing, and the like.
Amazingly, I have somehow 
managed to survive. Thats right: 
the meaningless chitchat, hardto-follow events, and ridiculous 
self-promotion are finally over. 
Tonight I can watch Murphy 
Brown..
In case you havent figured it 
out, Im not a big fan of the 
Winter Olympics. Now, Ill apolo
gize in advance to those of you 
who have been glued to the 
screen for the past two weeks 
and who salivate at the mere 
mention of the luge.
It isnt that I dont think the 
Olympics are a noble effort or a 
good idea; in fact, even I can get 
caught'up in the excitement of 
the moment. However, I do be
lieve that the Games are terri
bly overblown  and unfairly 
forced down our throats.
The coverage this year only 
reassured me of my stance. For 
two solid weekg, Sports took 
over, at the expense of Enter
tainment. Here are some of my 
biggest 1992 Olympic gripes.
1. My favorite shows were 
nowhere to be found. All right, 
this may seem personal and 
rather trivial, but Monday nights 
just arent the same without 
Murphy Brown and Northern 
Exposure. I cant begin to tell 
you how disappointing it is to 
turn on the set, expecting Jim 
and Corky, only to stare into the 
smiling faces of Tim McCarver 
and Paula Zahn.
Its not just these two shows, 
either. CBS interrupted its enTHE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
tire schedule for the Games. No 
Designing Women. No Brooklyn 
Bridge. No Murder, She Wrote. 
Not even a bit of Jake and the 
Fatman. In one fell swoop, a 
major network succeeded in 
alienating almost every part of 
its potential audience (except the 
sports freaks, of course).
So, you say, look around. Try 
the other networks, and discover 
some new shows. I tried, believe 
me. Unfortunately, the only 
thing I discovered was that I 
really missed my CBS favorites. 
For me, Blossom and the Movie 
of the Week just didnt cut it.
These interruptions might not 
have bothered me so much, ex
cept for the fact that...
2. All of the coverage was 
on tape. Due to the time differ
ence between Albertville and the 
USA, almost all of the events 
took place while we were snooz
ing. Still, CBS insisted on cut
ting a three-hour block out of 
prime time and filling it with 
tapes of events that happened 
the night before.
The worst part was that ev
eryone at CBS acted as though 
the coverage was live. At the end 
of a curling match, say, wed cut 
back to the studio, where 
McCarver and Zahn would send 
us scurrying to the exciting con
clusion of the figure skating 
championships. As if they didnt 
already know the results!
Call me crazy, but what would 
be wrong with having a nightly 
one-hour wrapup of the days
events? I mean, they already 
happened; why not show us the 
highlights instead of rehashing 
everything?
If enduring this every night 
werent enough, TNT fed us even 
more coverage during the day 
which leads, of course, to my 
next gripe.
3. TNT did little more than 
mimic CBS. I did not watch 
that much of the Olympics. But 
it seemed that whatever I did 
watch, I ended up seeing twice, 
thanks to TNT.
Case in point: the figure skat
ing competition. I spent fifteen 
or twenty minutes watching 
people dance on ice one night on 
CBS. The very next day, as I 
flipped through the channels, I 
couldnt help but notice that TNT 
was showing the exact same 
event that I had just viewed the 
previous evening. And, of course, 
the announcers were treating it 
as though it was brand spanking-new, ignoring the fact that 
about 95 percent of the viewing 
audience already knew the re
sult.
Excuse me, but isnt this over
kill on top of overkill? TNTs 
coverage seemed completely 
unnecessary. Really, the cable 
network had little choice. Lets 
face it: it could either repeat 
CBS coverage or broadcast less 
popular contests like hockey 
matches between Lithuania and 
Switzerland.
4. The prime time produc
tion on CBS wasnt gold 
medal stuff. Considering the 
hugeness of this event, it seems 
that CBS could have spent a 
little more time working out the 
kinks.
To start off, the theme music 
was less than inspiring (and, 
lets be honest, quite boring). 
Certainly not enough to rouse 
one from a comfortable Olym

The studio team of McCarver 
and Zahn didnt exactly get my 
heart a-beating, either. I think 
the real problem was with 
McCarver (who, by the way, has 
been described by more than one 
sports-ignorant person as Alan 
Thicke with wrinkles).

America that have not been

betrayal, or, in Texas, Yourea-fat-pig-and-I-dont-wannasleep-with-you-anymore epi

women, but who sticks it out 
with one woman instead of haul

Speaking of grotesque genetic

The Terror Within 11 stars a 
couple of veiny, lizard-legged 
monsters with bloody hair nets 
growing out of the sides of their 
skulls, tryingto rape the remain

Earth in order to produce even
more Mucus Beasts, and one of 
the women they try to rape is ... 
Stella Stevens!
Stella Stevens? She of the 
Jerry Lewis movies? Stella the 
perky blonde with the snow-cone

Yes, its the same Stella, be
cause the movie is directed by 
her son, the famous Andrew

Remember how sleazy he can 
be? Well, in this movie hes the 
action hero, because, after all,

basic AlDS-made-into-a-monster plot, with genetic DNA mu

countryside, infecting the popu

where they can find fresh vir
gins to impregnate with their 
nasty mutant seed. (Have sex 
tonight, get pregnant in the 
morning, give birth tomorrow 
night and by the third night, 
youd better have a good board

thing chews your head off. Its 
like the whole joyous experience 
of having children, compressed 
into 72 hours.)

desert, searching for peyote to 
make an anti-mutant vaccine, 
but first he has to save Clare

themselves from the weirdbeard

tarantulas that live under bar

 I cant figure out this Bill 
Glinton thing.
I could figure out Gary Hart. I 
knew what happened on that 
deal. People werent that mad at 
him for getting a little nookie on 
a tour boat. What they were mad 
about is he didnt call that gal 
back! I still think the guy could 
have been president today if hed 
just called her back.
You know what I mean?
Donna, er, uh, ummm, this is 
hard for me to say, but, you know, 
that thing on the boat last week 
I was really stupid. I lied to 
you. I feel terrible. Youre a won
derful woman. You deserve bet
ter than that. Whatever you de
cide to do, I could never blame 
you. I was wrong.
. This is the speech that works 
for me. Believe me, it would have 
worked for Gary Hart. That gal 
would have vanished.
But the Bill Clinton thing is 
different. First of all, the man 
lives in Little Rock. I have spent 
a lot of time in Little Rock. And 
everybody sleeps with everybody 
else in Little Rock, especially in 
politics. Little Rock is the ham
mock-hopping capital of Arkan
sas.- So dont believe it for a 
minute when you read some 
quote from a jowly Arkansas 
journalist claiming that Clinton 
is'(fflt of line. Dont forget that 
thiS.is the state that spawned 
Wilbur Mills, who aardvarked 
around with the Tidal Basin 
Bombshell and still got re
elected. Little Rock is the home 
of the most notorious groupie in 
rock-and-roll history  Sweet 
Siyeet Connie, immortalized in 
the Grand Funk Railroad song 
American Band.
 So my first point is that, if Bill

would still be on the conserva

But heres what I dont under
stand:
1. Are people mad at Bill 
Clinton because he had an af
fair, or affairs? He told every
body he screwed up. His wife 
told everybody he screwed up. 
He went on Sixty Minutes and 
practically said I did it nine 
ways from Sunday with every
thing that had two legs and still 
breathed. So its gotta be more 
than that, right? It was Gary 
Hart who lied about having the 
affair, not Bill Clinton.
2. Are people mad because he 
lied about when the affair was 
over?
Three things, about Gennifer 
Flowers: First, were talking 
about a woman who doesnt know 
how to spell Jennifer. Second, 
get a load of that hair. Third, can 
you really look at Hilary Clinton 
and think shes such'a dum-dum 
that, two months ago, while they

You can get a lot more out of life when you set your sights a little higher. Which is what applying for the American Express Card is all about. When you get the Card, its easier to do the things you want to do. And with the student savings that come along with it, you can do even more.
Fly roundtrip on 
Continental for less than $100 each way.Student Cardmembers receive four travel certificates. They can be used to fly anywhere Continental Airlines flies in the 48 contiguous United States. Two for the school year, and two for the summer* Depending on where you fly, each school year travel certificate is good for
$129 or $189 roundtripand each summer travel certificate is good for $149 or $199 roundtrip.
Savings that 
upgrade your lifestyle.As a student Cardmember you get more than great travel savings. You also save
money on everything from clothing to long distance phone calls. All for a $55 annual fee. Obviously, savings like these say a lot about the value of the Card. And having the Card will say a lot about you. For one thing it says you have a handle on what you spend, so you dont have to carry over a balance. It also says youre smart enough not to pay interest charges that can really add up. So take a few minutes now to call (have your bank address and account number ready), and apply for the American Express Card.With all that the Card offers you, not even the sky is the limit.

M is loosely based on the real life mass murderer 
Peter Kurten, who killed his victims in order to 
achieve orgasm. In this movie, the murderer, por
trayed by Peter Lorre, kills children and ends up 
chased by the public, the police, and even by other 
criminals, all of whom want to inflict their own 
personal revenge on him.
Lorre plays the part so convincingly that it is 
scary. It is no wonder that he is a lauded actor. The 
black and white film certainly does him justice.

Fletch. A fantastic masterpiece of comedic ge
nius. A must-see movie for absolutely everyone. 
The acting is superb, the writing even better. I ... 
Wait a minute! Im dreaming again. (Ive gotta stop 
falling asleep at the keyboard. That can turn into a 
really nasty habit. The other day a friend of my 
roommates brothers girlfriend got...) Fletch? Oh 
yeah, I almost forgot. Which is what you should do.
Forget about this movie if youre not a Chevy 
Chase fan, which (as youve probably guessed) I am 
not. Even if you are a Chase fan, I urge caution.
In this film, Chase plays an undercover L.A. 
reporter battling a major drug ring. The comedy is 
mediocre at best (though, I must admit that there 
are a few funny lines, a very few), and brain-dead at 
worst.
So, if you have absolutely nothing to do (and this 
being Carnegie Mellon, I seriously doubt that), or 
need a reason to procrastinate, I suggest you bite 
the bullet and do your work.

Ranked right up there with the best of the cult 
classics, is Pink Floyds The Wall, which is coming 
to campus this weekend. It's one of those films 
almost everyone has seen with their high school 
friends. The film is also known to be best while 
drunk or stoned, but is great for sober viewers as 
well.
The film tells the story of a man named Pink who 
goes through several phases in his life. The musical 
score is phenomenal, and the animation will blow 
you away.
The Wall has the potential to depress you as well. 
Violent images will remain with you for a long time 
after seeing this one. Youll also be humming Pink 
Floyd tunes for days, even if youve never heard 
them before  what could be better?

Less Than Zero, adapted from the novel by Bret 
Easton Ellis, is a movie about a group of young Los 
Angeles have-it-alls quivering on the brink of their 
own destructions. At least, thats what its supposed 
to be about. The plot is so sanitized that I wondered 
if this movie actually had been taken from the book.
It appears as if the scriptwriters took a cursory 
glance at the novel, and wrote a script using charac
ters of the same names. The novel is shocking and 
intense, two things that I couldnt say about the 
movie.
The two leads in the film (Andrew McCarthy and 
Jami Gertz) are terrible. As if in compensation, 
James Spader is competent and quite believable as 
a slimy drug dealer and Robert Downey, Jr. gives an 
exceptional performance as a wealthy addict.
All I can do is recommend that you see it and 
judge for yourself. (Id also recommend that you 
read the book.)

Madame Bovary flaunts excessive plot
By AARON JENKINS
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
A remake of Madame Bovary, 
based on Gustave Flauberts re
alist novel of the same name, 
opened this past Friday at the 
Pittsburgh Playhouse. The 
movie, like the book, pokes fun 
at social classes and the happyending romance novels that 
were very popular in France in 
the 19th century.
The premiere showing of the 
movie was not very crowded, only 
about half full. The people that 
were there were buzzing with 
excitement; Oh yes, darling, I 
read the book years ago! and 
Yes, and wasnt it simply de
lightful?
The film is in French with 
English subtitles. Usually Im 
not a great fan of subtitles, but 
in this case it added immensely 
to the pleasure of the movie to be 
able to hear the original French. 
For those of us who took three or 
four years of the language in 
high school, it was also a great 
time to brush up on a few words 
and phrases. The only complaint 
I had about the subtitles was 
that the beginning credits cov
ered them up, so for five min
utes you couldnt read what was 
being said. Luckily, not much 
happened.
Madame Bovary is the story of 
Emma, who starts out as a serv
ing wench in her fathers rural 
inn. Her father breaks his leg 
and sends for Doctor Charles 
Bovary. Emma is interested in 
him and very forwardly presents 
herself to him. Fifteen minutes 
into the movie, they are mar
ried.
Emma (now Madame Bovary) 
soon finds herself disillusioned 
with Charles. In her eyes, 
Charles is a boring, pathetic 
bootlicker who ruins every 
chance for her. Emma yearns 
for better things, asking herself 
Why me? Why me? She feels 
love for Charles only occasion
ally  especially when he gets 
her invited to a Dukes ball, and 
when he moves his practice to a 
bigger town, Yonville.
In Yonville, Emma falls for a 
young man, Leon Dupris, and 
he for her. Both have the souls of

artists andpoets. Unfortunately 
for her, Leon is free to do as he 
wants, and moves away from 
Yonville to Paris. He is after the 
balls, the champagne, the fancy 
dress, and Emma falls into a 
deep depression after he leaves, 
partly from the pain of him leav
ing, partly from being jealous of 
him.
Soon after Leons departure, 
Emma is seduced by a' young 
urban stud, and begins an affair 
with him. They pi an to run a way 
together, and Emma is happy 
once again.
It is in her happier moments 
that Emma looks radiant. When 
she is depressed she looks some
what haggard. Her appearance 
reflects her extreme moods, and 
her make-up and wardrobe are 
superb.
Up to this point the movie is 
excellent. The acting is great, 
the scenery and sets are incred
ible, and the story line moves 
along well.
Isabelle Hupperts portrayal 
of Emma Bovary is wonderful. 
She is entirely believable in her 
role. She portrays all of the ex
treme emotions of Emma with 
ease. Her performance is flaw
less, as is Jean-Francois 
Balmer's portrayal of Charles.
Balmer is realistic in his role 
making his acting better than 
Hupperts despite the fact that 
he plays a lesser character. 
Balmer is polished and smooth, 
and falls cleanly into character. 
The rest of the cast was simi
larly perfect in their perfor
mances, and they imitate 19th 
century life France realistically.
The sets are what add most to 
the movies flavor. There are 
some of the best sets Ive ever 
seen in thismovie.Thereis never 
a cobblestone or a ruffle out of 
place. It is a picture perfect dis
play of old towns and cities in 
France. Thats not to say that 
its all pretty. Not at all. There is 
dirt and mud, and beggars and 
deformed men wander in the 
background. On the other hand, 
the countryside, the forests, and 
the cities are literally breath
taking. Its worth seeing Ma
dame Bovary just for the scen
ery. You wont be disappointed.
The bad thing about the movie 
is that the story line drags un
bearably during the second half.
formation being presented to 
justify the length. These same 
events and affairs become rep
etitious and predictable.
Early in the movie, one of the 
more interesting points is to 
learn about Madame Bovary  
to experience her character, to 
watch her struggles and to feel 
sympathetic towards her. Once 
her character is developed, we 
cant feel for her anymore, be
cause shes  well, youll figure 
it out if you see it.
Emma simply becomes more 
and more outrageous, more and 
more unbearable, until the end 
of the movie. Luckily, the end
ing is fitting for her, and youll 
be happy. Speaking of the end
ing, on the way out of the the
ater, I overheard at least ten 
other people saying, Why didnt 
that happen 45 minutes ago? 
That sums my feelings up per
fectly.
The first half of Madame 
Bovary is a joy to watch. The
fill, and the story intriguing and !; 
exciting. Its a shame that the 
director let the story fall apart 
in the second hour. Its just too 
much.
With a few more meaningful > 
scenes and a lot less repetitive  
browbeating, Madame Bovary 
would be the best film Ive seen ! 
in a long time. As it is, if youre 
willing to pay to see scenery, or 
if the lengthy novel is one of your 
favorites, see it. Otherwise, 
think it over first.

Though they tend to relyjusta 
little too much on remixes of 
popular tracks (with two remixes 
of the title track on the album, 
and more surely on the way), on 
the whole, KMFDM continues a 
winning streak with Money, 
managing not to become pigeon
holed by the sound of their mu

recommending this album, and 
I urge anyone with an interest

After a wait of about a year 
and a half, German musicians 
KMFDM (which some say stands 
for "Kill Mother Fucking 
Depeche Mode," and others be
lieve to be a German translation 
of "No Mercy for the Masses" ) 
have released their new album, 
Money. This is the fifth album 
from this cornerstone of the industrialmusicmovement. Itcontinues a trend in their music, 
mixing the hard-techno beat so 
common in industrial dance 
music with liberal samples from 
heavy metal bands such as 
Slayer.
Money, containing eleven 
tracks which altogether clock in 
at just under 55 minutes, is a 
strong presentation, with an in
teresting blend of undistorted 
female vocals and heavily dis
torted male vocals that evoke 
memories of the groups earlier 
techno-reggae-industrial re
lease, UAIOE. The tracks on 
Mon-ey range in quality from the 
rather mundane, sample-laden 
We Must Awaken to the eardrum-ripping title track. This 
track is supported by the grav
elly, distorted vocals of lead 
singer En Esch, as he spins the 
tale of a white-trash drug dealer.
Other strong tracks include 
Vogue, the first single released

cover of the Madonna tune, but
