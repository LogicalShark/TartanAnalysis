VOL. HI, No. 33 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, MAY 26, 1909 TEN CENTS
PITT WINS THE MEET
The University of Pittsburg won the intercollegiate 
track and field meet last Saturday afternoon at the 
Schenley oval, before a large crowd. Tech was a 
close second and W. & J. ''College was third. The 
best race of the afternoon was the one-mile relay for 
colleges, which was won by Pitt. Tech put up a
dandy fight for this race, but seemed tired and did
not show their best form. Halferty and Capt. Dowl
ing were again the stars for Tech, running in per
fect form in all their events. After the meet John 
Charles was unanimously elected captain of the 
field and track team for next year. Chuck is one 
of the most popular fellows in Tech and everyone is 
glad to hear that the track team will have such a 
competent leader for next year. Charles captained 
the hocky team here in 1906 and 1907, and with him 
at its head the track team should be even more suc
cessful than it has been this year. Summaries:

M. M. C. S.
W AFF\ULs ERRWNA.
Everything was dark in the room, but the Post 
Card Album was having a lovely time; in fact, a 
light might have put an end to her merry making. 
She was one of the dainty sort; wearing a blue 
dress trimmed in white, and lined with a beautiful 
shade of gray. Scattered all through her lining 
were the post cards; and <,UD a variety! This was 
the birthday of Mr. Carte Postale, Egypte, and they 
all were celebrating the event by making him the 
listener while each told, or HPLr to tell, the most 
difficult errand he had ever performed.
The young lady in the bathing suit starte'd by say
ing, I have been to the beach, and one time some 
one"Well, what if you have, broke in The 
White House, anybody can go there, but everyone 
cant be the Presidents Home. Youre nothing but 
a poor advertisement, anyhow, and ought to come 
from the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School in 
Pittsburgh, judging from the verse you carry around. 
You sound for all the world like one of those House
hold Arts girls with your: 
"Dainty Miss, of germs be wary,
Is your towel sanitary?
Is it pure, and sweet, and fair,
Like the ocean and the air?
Is it softyet giving vim
When you rub down from your swim?
If its all this, maid so chary,
Then its surely
San-Knit-ary.
Im sure that is an extremely good example of 
iambic tetrameter, said pretty Miss Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School when Mr. White House 
had finished reading. It is almost worthy of being 
s;t to music and made one of our school songs. Do 
you know by whom it was written and where I could 
go to procure a copy?
Hump, declared The Bath, why dont you see 
to getting famous pictures,yes, I may as well ac
knowledge that I mean like myself,instead of 
thinking about foolish school songs.
Why 'do you all scrap so much? said Cupid. 
You Know My Hearts Aflame With Love For You, 
yes, for LOLPoSBL hei'e, and it hurts me so to hear 
you scrapping in this way. You believe me, dont 
you? he asked appealingly, and as no one an
swered, he tearfully gazed at his neighbor, The 
Tennis Champion. Yes, I suppose I do, she re
sponded. Love is alright in its place, but as far 
as " concerned I always want the love on the other 
side of the net when Im playing tennis.
Yes, love < all right B H< tREUL&| spoke up a plain 
card, covered with queer looking hieroglyphics, but
there is no need of letting the whole world know it. 
Have a secret code, as I do.
Well, havent I? said a card written in short
hand.
"Not much, answered a typewritten one. "Why,
any of the Secretarais of 09 of that pretty M. M.
C. S. can read your message.
That speaks well for the school, laughed The 
Business Girl. "It isnt every stenographer that 
can read anothers notes. John and I
Just then there came an awful wail from the
tearful female sitting next to Mr. Carte Postale.
And is he gone, and is he gone?
She cried and wept outright.
Then I will to the waters side,
And see him out of sight.
Well, hell not thank you if you set up any more 
cat howls like that, crossly s.poke up "The Roose
velt Bears.
"For goodness sake, my current will be ruined if 
this keeps up, said A River in Ohio. Im used 
to having things run smoothly. Listen while 1 tell 
you of the mcfst difficult errand I ever undertook, for
I must say we are wandering woefully from our 
subject. Fritz bought me to send to his pal, saying, 
as you can read on my face, Come to the boathouse 
Tuesday, and with Golikell we can paddle up to the 
Island, and drift home in the twilight. At the same 
time he scratched off a few words to his lady love; 
at least <DL wanted to be that. Naturally, in his 
excitement, he addressed his pals to her. Well, she 
read itcameand conquered. Guess he proposed 
on the way home. They drifted with the tide, and 
his thoughts drifted to her, and he suddenly awoke 
to the fact that he was desparately in love. 
"That's like they all end, sighed To my Love, 
but where does the difficult errand come in?
Why, cant you Imagine how the lady felt after 
reading that card? She thought Golikell was a third 
party and that the proposal would be iput off again, 
and decided not to go. 1 had a fearful and wonderful 
time making her understand it was only a perfectly 
harmless canoe: the best place in the world for a 
proposal.
And the next morning when the maid was dusting 
the books she noticed that the pretty blue Albums 
lining was torn and split in many places. Of course, 
she could not know that the cards had caused it 
when they laughed at the fearfully exciting and 
screamingly funny story, told by A River in 
Ohio; for as such it was considered by the cards, 
and if oS, dont agree with them, there is no one 
in the world to blame; you're only to be pitied, that 
is ah. Dorothy B. Scott.
Dr. MartinMiss Atwood, will you please name 
the bones in the human skull?
Miss AtwoodI have them all in my head, but 
cant recall their names.

Captain Dowling closed his athletic career at Tech 
by again winning the individual championship in 
the Intercollegiate meet last Saturday. Dowling has 
been the most consistent athlete Tech has ever had 
and has been able to do wonders with limited ma
terial against adverse circumstances. If Charles 
does as well as we hope and believe he will with next 
years team, we will have no cause to feel ashamed 
of our track athletes.
Mr. Charles Parsons, who was formerly assistant 
Registrar of the Carnegie Technical iSchools, last 
week met an untimely end by drowning in the Al
legheny river. Mr. Parsons had left Tech to accept 
a position in which he gave promise of being very 
successful and every one of us is grieved that the 
career of a young man of such promise is cut short.
The Tartan is able to announce that Mr. Snitzer 
has accepted the position tendered him as coach of 
next falls foot-ball team. With his coaching and 
under the leadership of Captain Hittner, the foot-ball 
team will undoubtedly have a very successful season.
sHE PWsRON7 ANNER.
The dark clouds which had threatened all the 
morning melted away when Red Jones took off his 
hat and donned his muz'zle, officially starting the 
base-ball game. It has been a time-honored custom, 
since last year, to sharpen the appetite for the din
ner with a ball game, which the Night Class has won 
until this year. However, Red worked like a Trojan 
and they only beat us by the close score of 14 to 2.
Doubtless the score would have been much less had 
Mr. Lee and Mr. Zeller been there to root, but Mr. 
Lee was superintending the erection of a balloon, 
and Zeller, with an eye to the eternal feminine, was 
interviewing the fair areonautess, as she tripped 
lightly hither and yon. In explanation we might 
say that the dinner was held at Donegal Inn, West 
View Park, and that the balloon was a real one and 
does not refer to the Night Classes pitcher, Proessler, he of the strong arm.
After the ball game there were races. Red won 
undying fame, a medal, and the 100-yd. dash. Rigi 
was second, running in beautiful form, and with all 
the scenic accessories. In the Faculty race Mr. Weber 
proved tobe the Wonder Child and won in a walk, depite the efforts of Mr. Hornbostle and Mr. Hewlett to 
trip him at the start. Mr. Ferrand, who was touted as 
the dark horse in the race, was unfortunately over
come when Mr. Zeller took off his chapeau, and was 
unable to finish. The Faculty d:sappeared after 
their race and were found some two hours later still 
discussing it, in the cellar of the inn.
At precisely half past seven the real noise began. 
Headed by the indomitable Rigi the hungry mob 
broke into the dining room just as the Faculty had 
found their places at the head of the festive board. 
Round the room they snake-danced to the admiring 
delight of the Patron, the Faculty, the Director, and 
an undistinguishable Eitheopean quartet. All found 
their places finally, and calmed down enough to gape 
at the wonderfully busy poster which Mr. Sparks 
had made, and which occupied a place of honor at 
one end of the room.
Then the soup was served, and in the midst of the 
frantic attack on it, the quartet, thinking things were 
dragging, started Hail, hail, and that song about 
the gang. This seemed to aggravate Mr. Hornbostle 
and he started the famous chair ride, which com
pletely siienced the quartet and exhausted the riders. 
After that everybody started in to attend to the 
business of the evening, which was Rosbif, ala Horny, 
smashed spuds, sparrow grass, cold dolphin, and 
other choice vivands too numerous to mention. (That 
last is a hackneyed phrase, but Gaston was getting 
impatient and we couldnt stop to find another.)
We were lucky enough to have the Director, or 
rather he was lucky enough to be there, and so he 
was called on and gave us a fine and sparkling little 
address. Then our Patron scintillated from the top 
of a chair till the bunch grew hysterical. Then Prof. 
McGoodwin and the rest of the Faculty said their 
pieces, received the gold medals distributed among 
them by Dolly Gray. John Slovinic and Joy were 
quieted and Dick Clark squelched, and we broke 
up in time to catch the owl car home, to the great 
relief of the inhabitants of West View, loveliest vil
lage of the hills, for everything was rosy to our eyes 
then, and it surmised that everybody reached home.
In conclusion we might add that Archie Boyer wras 
toast-master.
Mr. Hornbostel announced that the traveling 
scholarship had been awarded to Burkhart.

The usual method of judging the success of a pro
fessional theatrical venture is to watch the box 
office receipts the first few days of the sale, to see 
if the public are sufficiently interested to part with 
the coin. Such a method applies just as well to col
lege plays of semi-professional character.
When the seat sale for the two performances at 
the Nixon, Saturday, was opened at 9 A. iM., Monday, 
nearly a hundred people were standing in line at 
the Nixon box office, and the fact that by evening 
nearly $1,000 worth of Subscribers and Patronesses 
cards had been exchanged, speaks volumes in itself. 
With the public cash seat sale opening yesterday 
with somewhat of a rush, business for His Highness, 
the Chef, is booming.
The second performance of the season was given 
to a small but appreciative audience in the New 
Castle Opera House, and went with more easiness 
and smoothness all the way through.
All arrangements are now complete for the big 
event of the season, the matinee and evening at the 
Nixon. A box has been reserved for President Taft 
and his party who will be in the city that evening.
The third performance was given to a good house 
in the Majestic Theatre, Butler, last night, but too 
late for any detailed account in this issue.
Any one wanting seats had better get them at once.

There was great excitement the other day when 
the dressmakers were notified that they had been 
found guilty of this awful offense. Alas, for the 
delightful Thursday evening suppers! The girls are 
still looking for a solution of their difficulties.
Miss Florence Gwyn, of the Senior Dressmaking 
Glass, was badly burned the other day by the burn
ing out of a fuse while she was changing the cord 
from one electric iron to another. We all hope 
Miss Gwyn will soon be able to use her hand again.
Once there was a little Willie,
Long time age.
He was nothing but a kid,
Baby Boy, OH!
Then one day he had a birthday,
But he didnt know,
For twas just his very first one,
Long time ago.
And his presents were so funny,
Long time ago.
They consisted of a rattle,
Which jingled so;
And a pretty little dollie,
White as the snow;
And a book all full of doggies,
Long time ago.
This same Willie (Wm. Wood, now)
'Short time ago,
Had his, he says, forty-sixth one,
Can it be so?
But this birthday was so different,
Queer, dont you know,
From that first that WTillie boasted,
Long time ago.
This time, Senior (Secretarials,
Never are they slow,
Got a great big bag of candy,
Took their money, though;
Gave it to their darling teacher,
Embarrassed him? NO!
For their kindness quite surprised him,
Short time ago. 1
To the board, then, William A. Wood,
They told to go. \

If Pitt had not barred Irons because of a late

The Glee and Mandolin Clubs held their annual 
election of officers for the coming year last Sunday 
afternoon. The results are as follows:
President(EL F. Gump, 11 Night.
Secretary & TreasurerA. L. Summers, 10 Night.
ManagerW. H. King, Jr., 10 Day.
Assistant Manager -(from Glee Club)Roy Hodgden, 12 Day.
Assistant Manager (from Mandolin Club)Wilbur 
P. Gettman, 11 Day.
Librarian (Glee Club)R. R. Rose, 11 Day.
Librarian (Mandolin Club)Wilbert L. Hindman, 
'12 Night.
A committee was also appointed., to arrange for 
the annual banquet:
Mr. Summers, chairman; Mr. Rodgers, Mr. Ham
ilton.
The Glee Club rehearsal followed the annual busi
ness meeting, and there was a large attendance. 
Good progress was made at Hotel Schenley Lawn on 
Tuesday evening, June 15th, in a joint concert with 
the Pittsburgh Festival Orchestra.
The Glee Club did well to arrange for such a con
cert. It undoubtedly gives them musical recognition 
which should be of value to them. The, event is a 
part of the official Commencement exercises of the 
Schools, and the students should see to it as their 
duty, that the grounds are packed. We ho^e that the 
Club will again give us 'the same good standard of 
music, which we have received on all former occa
sions this year. All seats are placed at 50c each, and 
can be procured from any member of the Club, or 
at the store room. It is desired that all students 
procure their tickets at the school.
NOs\E.
Copies of all pictures in the Thistle can be ob
tained from H. A. Neel at 35c each. Don iSeele also 
has a large number of pictures which have been 
ordered, but not called for. He requests the parties 
ordering pictures to call for them. '

Does Dr. James think he is a zoological garden or 
a steamboat? The way he remarked Boo the 
other morning left some room for doubt.
Ex-Gov. Stone to the fore. He furnished us with 
some real wild west when he lassoed Tenehner. It 
might be a good idea to challenge the iSophs to a 
lassoing contest.
Next year's Pleibe class ought to be a good one. 
Already several 1912 men are candidates for admis
sion.
Latest fashions for men: Dr. Hokanson appeared 
at school last week wearing an overcoat and straw 
hat.
Denny (in debate): I wish to make a few re
marks before I begin to speak.
The Pittsburg Chronicle Telegraph has recognized 
the Plebe debaters. On Thursday evening, quite an 
editorial concerning the Gold Standard, appeared.
Prof. KellarWhat in the dickens is the matter? 
Has an epidemic of worms broken out?
Gamble says he is going to take up plumbing. 
Doubtless a great future lies before him.

Prof. KnoxIt suddenly starts to stop. A most 
unusual phenomenon.
So Hendy won a place in the two-mile event last 
Saturday? Congratulations, Hendy. The Plebe class

gymnasium or drill credits.
A recent action of the Harvard faculty was to pro

lack of support for the teams.
The profits of the Columbian, Columbia's year
