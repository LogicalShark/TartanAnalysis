Kappas and S.A.E.s Capture 
First Honors in Sing Contest
The Interfraternity Council-sponsored Greek Sing and 
Swing was held in Thistle Hall and the Gymnasium on Sat
urday night from 6:45 to 1 A. M. This second semi-formal af
fair of the year was one of the best, thanks to the amount of 
time and energy which the eager Greeks expended in its 
preparation.
The evening began almost on 
time in Thistle Hall with three 
songs by the colorfully dressed 
girls of the Chi Omega sorority. 
The other sororities and frater
nities followed in quick and alter
nating succession, as this well 
planned affair went off like clock
work. All of the Greek organiza
tions are to be commended for 
their efforts, and the girls are to 
be especially congratulated for 
their ingenuity in supplementing 
their singing with some beautiful 
visual effects.
Kappa Kappa Gamma won the 
rather close sorority competition, 
but all of the feminine singing 
showed the effects of plenty of 
practice and careful planning. Clad 
in peasant blouses and Hawaiian 
print skirts and led by the ener
getic Eleanor Gustafson, the Kap
pas converted the words of the 
Hawaiian War Chant into a ditty 
on the Sing and Swing for their 
best song, which was undoubtedly 
the margin of triumph. The 
AEPhis, arranged in alternating 
sections of black and white formals, used an excellent choice of 
selections and good voices to come 
in second and receive honorable 
mention. The beautiful Theta line 
in their gowns of argent gave the 
winners a good run for the honors. 
Blaok dresses encircled by variApril Technical 
Appears in April
The April issue of the Carnegie 
Technical is now on sale. Ordinar
ily such a statement would not ap
pear unusual, but the readers at
tention is called to the fact that 
this month is April. In other words 
the Technical has come out on 
time. For only ten cents, you can 
be enlightened by articles on vari
ous technical and non-technical 
subjects from the Pittsburgh Street 
Railway System to high frequency 
heating, illustrated with drawings 
and photographs, and printed on 
slick paper. The unusual cover, 
designed by Gus Kermes, is in 
keeping with the magazines pol
icy of eye-catching designs and has 
won praise from many sources.
During the war years, a small 
staff proved to be an almost in
surmountable obstacle to the pro
duction of Techs science and en
gineering publication, and in many 
cases the editors put the entire 
magazine together themselves. 
However, the return of veterans 
to the campus has permitted Joe

Theta Tau Holds Initiation; 
Doherty Now Honorary Member
Theta Tau, national profession
al engineering fraternity, confer
red upon Dr. Robert E. Doherty 
an honorary membership in the 
fraternity last Sunday. In addition 
to Dr. Doherty the following stu
dents were initiated: A. Roberts 
Dismukes, Walter S. Ebert, RichSigma Xi Holds 
Banquet, Initiation
The society of Sigma Xi held 
its annual initiation and banquet 
on Saturday evening, April 27, at 
the Carnegie Union. Before the 
banquet, which was held at 6:30, 
the new members and associates 
were initiated. Those initiated to 
full membership were: Paul
Cohen, Norman W. Franke, Prof. 
James S. Koehler, Dr. Leslie D. 
McGraw, Prof. William O. Philbrook, Prof. Claude R. Schwob, 
and Charles W. Young. Initiated 
as associate members were: Pierre 
Raoul Aigrain, Donald F. Aldrich, 
Richard Louis Bright, Catherine 
M. Brosky, Charles Arthur Dube, 
Harold A. Gottesman, Carol Green, 
Edouard J. Guigonis, George A. 
Klotzbaugh, Stephanie Kwolek, 
Aurele Raphael Meunire, Julia 
Randall, Cornelius L. Sarsody, 
Benjamin L. Schwartz, and Del
bert M. Van Winkle. After the 
banquet Dr. J. A. Hutcheson, As
sociate Director of Research at the 
Westinghouse Electric Corpora
tion, spoke on Electronics in War 
and Peace. The President of the 
chapter, Professor Edwin A Whit
man, gave a brief address of in
structions and the purpose of the 
society, which is the encourage
ment of research in science, both 
pure and applied.
Sigma Xi is composed for the 
most part of faculty members and 
graduates, though a few outstand
ing undergraduates are initiated. 
However since the society is an 
open one, the initiation is not se
cret.
The Carnegie Chapter of Sigma 
Xi was founded in 1937. There are 
97 chapters of the society and ap
proximately 4,500 members. This 
year, Sigma Xi has sponsored five 
lectures, including such speakers 
as Professors Warner, Seitz, Wil
liams, Morad, and Mitchell.
ard L. Heckman, Joseph B. Meirdirks, Jr., Cloyd R. Mellot, Gerard 
M. Pederson, and Vance Senecal. 
Following the initiation which 
was performed in the Carnegie 
Union, a banquet in honor of the 
initiates was held. Dr. Frederick 
T. Mavis, acting as toastmaster, 
introduced the Regent of Nu 
Chapter, Rolf Weil, who spoke 
briefly on the future of the fra
ternity. Then Jerard Pederson 
spoke for the pledges, followed by 
Professor Daniels, who represent
ed the Executive Council.' The 
main speaker of the evening, Dr. 
Elliot D. Smith, discussed the 
topic Can College Students Be 
Taught To Use Good English? 
A few remarks by Dr. Doherty 
ended the program. Also present 
at the banquet were Dr. Webster 
N. Jones, Dean Holbrook of the 
University of Pittsburghs Engi
neering School, Dr. Charles Fettke, 
Dr. Robert Teare and a number of 
alumni.
Deanie Miller Elected 
1947 Thistle Editor
Elections for the editorial staff 
of the 1947 Thistle were held Fri
day afternoon, April 26. Chosen to 
head the staff as Editor is Deanie 
Miller. The job of Managing Ed
itor falls on Roger Borneman, 
while Betts Baur will be in charge 
of the business staff as Business 
Manager. Elected Associate Edit
ors were Dave Kobernuss and Liz 
Moses. The positions of Art Editor 
and Advertising Manager have not 
been filled as yet.
The 1946 Thistle has been com
pleted and will be ready for dis
tribution about the fifteenth of 
May. The exact time and place of 
distribution will be announced lat
er. From all advance indications, 
this years Thistle will show a 
marked improvement over war
time editions, and will be well 
worth the extra cost. There will 
be about 50 more pages than the 
previous Thistlea total of 208, 
with color on every page. The 
c| ver is imitation leather; . . . 
lots more candids, too. Due prob
ably to increased enrollment, sales 
have doubledabout 900 Thistles 
will be printed.
In the final week before Spring Carnival, to be held May 
3 and 4, Carnegie Tech eagerly awaits this biggest festival event 
of the year. All groups are working feverishly to com
plete preparations for the gala weekend, and this work in
cludes the gaily decorated booths, the smooth racers for the 
sweepstakes contest, and plans for many house parties.
Ferris Wheel and Booths on Cut
With all the preliminary plan
ning for Spring Carnival com
pleted for weeks, the last minute 
details are being worked out now.
Decorations, both for Thistle Hall 
and the Gym, have gotten under 
way, and this week will see the 
Decorations Committee, and all 
people who can help, complete the 
elaborate decorations planned.
During the week, tents will begin 
to dot the Cut; these structures 
will be filled with all kinds of 
booths in keeping with the Carni
val athosphere. And a treat is in 
store, for there will be a ferris 
wheel and a miniature train. These 
also will be placed on the Cut.
Friday Eve Full of Events
The Campus Week program will 
be packed full of fun and enter
tainment. Carnival will open Fri
day afternoon when the fraterni
ties will match buggy racers in 
the preliminary heats of the 
Sweepstakes races at 4:30. The 
only production of Scotch and 
Soda will be given that evening at 
8:00 in the Gym, when the musical 
show, Take It From Here, will be 
presented. It promises to be a riot 
of fun.
Immediately following the 
Scotch and Soda presentation, an 
hour and a half show, informal 
dancing will begin in Thistle Hall.
But it is also at this time that the 
carnival booths and rides located 
on the cut will be operating at 
full capacity. Amusement-bent 
students will spend their time 
shuttling between the Cut and 
Thistle Hall.
Carnival will pick up Saturday 
morning where it left off the pre
vious night. To build up interest 
in the revived football team, Coach 
Bill Donohoe is having an exhibi
tion practice game between two 
of his football squads. This will 
be at 10:00 Saturday morning, and 
will mark a change in the original 
program as released previously.
Immediately following this 
game, Coronation of the Campus 
Queen and Call Day will take 
place as planned. This will proba
bly be around 11:00 or 11:30 Sat[continued on p. 4]
Sweepstakes
Glee Clubs Give 
Combined Concert
Last Wednesday evening at 8:15 
P.M. in the Exhibition Hall, the 
Carnegie Tech Mens and Womens 
Glee Clubs presented their annual 
home concert. The program was 
presented before an unexpected 
capacity crowd and the concert 
proved unusually successful, par
ticularly in view of the fact that 
the Mens Glee Club has reorgan
ized just this year.
Probably the most engaging of 
the womens songs was The Two 
Clocks, a novelty number with sev
eral interesting vocal effects. The 
mens best effort was the virile 
and ever-popular Stout-hearted 
Men.
In place of Dottie Feldman, Retta Callery capably sang two so
prano solos, with Down in the For
est proving the better.
Charles Tritle sang two tenor 
solos and added Give a Man a 
Horse He Can Ride as an encore. 
His best-received song by far was

Honoraries 
Tap Members
The Call Day ceremony at 
Spring Carnival will be held in 
conjunction with the Coronation, 
Saturday at noon. These two cere
monies will present a very color
ful pageant especially if the 
weather permits their being held 
in the Sylvan Theater. Fourteen 
honoraries, Alpha Phi Omega, 
Beaux Arts, Cwens, Delta Skulls, 
Eta Kappa Nu, Mortar Board, O. 
D. K, Phi Kappa Phi, Pi Delta Ep
silon, Pi Tau Sigma, Scimitars, 
Sigma Alpha Iota, Sigma Xi, and 
Theta Tau are expected to make 
their calls to about two hundred 
students. Part of the tradition of 
Call Day is the mystery that at
tends the actual calling. This tra
dition will be maintained.
The Campus Queen will preside 
over both ceremonies. She will call 
the president of each honorary 
who will in turn give a short 
speech in which he will present 
the purpose of the organization 
and the basis of judgment for elec
tion to the honorary. At the com
pletion of his introductory speech 
the president will read the names 
of the students who are being call
ed. These students will then come 
forward to receive the symbol of 
the honorary and to be congrat
ulated by the president. The band 
for the Musical Revue will provide 
entertainment between some of 
the calls.
C.I.T. Gets Award
The establishment of 22 gradu
ate fellowships at 17 educational 
institutions, including Carnegie 
Tech, by Standard Oil Company 
was announced today by Dr. Rob
ert E. Wilson, chairman of the 
board, who said the purpose of 
the program is to provide seed 
corn for future research.
The C. I. T. fellowship is in 
chemical engineering. Other 
schools to receive the fellowship 
in this field include Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. Minne

Editors Armchair
Slightly Stale
We are confused. We are very confused. We used to go 
into Skibo and everyone would rush up to us and shout, Why 
dont you write an editorial about this slow lunch line, Her
ron. Why dont you get someone to do something about it. Its 
terrible. We put off doing anything, as we always do, until 
we had lost three-fourths of our friends. Then we tacked our
selves onto the end of a committee and went to suggest some 
changes in the lunch lines to Mr. Miller. After a long and in
tellectual debate conducted on an extremely high plane, the 
committee arrived at the startling conclusion that wrapped in
stead of individually-made sandwiches would increase the ef
ficiency of the lunch lines and cut down that interminable 
waiting period. Mr. Miller acted immediately upon this sug
gestion and the little wrapped morsels with the green and yel
low stripes began to appearon the counter.
We were very happy because the line did seem to move 
faster and we heard two favorable comments about the sand
wiches the first day. Then we began to hear complaints. It 
seems there were very violent objections to the stale little 
sandwiches waiting in their paper wrappers. Why dont you 
write an editorial about these stale sandwiches, Herron? Why 
dont you do something about them? Theyre terrible. We have 
now lost the other 25% of our friends. Its very confusing. Do 
the students want to eat in a hurry or do they want to eat well. 
At present the administration and the committee cannot de
vise a system by which both ends can be achieved. We should 
like to get a cross-section of student opinion on the whole ques
tion. Please write to the Tartan through Interschool mail and 
tell us whether you prefer to wait or to eat stale sandwiches, 
and enclose any plan you may have for combining efficiency 
with edibility in Skibo.
The World You Will Die In
During the war that has just come to a close all of us look
ed forward to the world wide peace that our leaders had prom
ised us. We naively supposed that the causes of past wars: in
ternational jealousy, international economic stupidity, and the 
covetousness individual big business men would melt into 
vapor once the conflict was terminated. We thought the noble 
self-sacrifice and international cooperation that prevailed 
while the nations of the world were fighting for their lives 
would be sustained during the following years of peace. We 
were wrong. We were painfully excruciatingly, and disgust
ingly naive. For the world is, in this the eighth month after 
the war, already embroiled in petty nationalistic bickerings 
over a million trivial issues, and the possibilities for perma
nent or even temporary peace, rather than the causes of war, 
are vanishing into the air.
On the International front, the United States, champion 
of the democratic and the liberal and the progressive, has al
ready contributed more than its share toward the final dis
integration of the United Nations Organization. A hundred 
other nationality groups are haggling for a higher status in 
the hierarchy of nations. The business men of the United States 
and Britain are worrying about their precious profits and 
trying to lobby for the continuance of the German industries 
in which they have so much capital invested. Our government 
is hoarding the secret of the atomic bomb because all of our 
statesmen are shaping their policies on the assumption that an
other war is necessary and inevitable. These same statesmen 
are opposing the liberal and the democratic element in China 
because the business interests in China are on the dictatorial 
side of Chiang Kai Chek.
At home our good-hearted but weak minded president

CBS Sponsors 
US-Great Britain 
Letter Program
Carnegie Tech students along 
with the students of all American 
colleges now have a chance to in
quire about or comment on the 
people and the customs of Great 
Britain in the new CBS-BBC intenational broadcast series which 
started over the Columbia net
work Sunday, April 28 at 12:30 
EDT. The program, which orig
inates in New York and London, 
is built around letters from the 
citizens of both countries.
The letters may be on any sub
ject from the British college sys
tem to the British Loan. After the 
letter is read on the air, answers 
will be invited from the ad
dressee nation and these in turn 
will be read on the air at a fu
ture broadcast.
All letters from American lis
teners should be addressed to 
Yours Sincerely, CBS, New 
York 22, N. Y. Letters will become 
the property of CBS, the highlights 
of the best being used on the pro
gram.
This program will give various 
college students a chance to ask 
questions about England and to 
receive answers from people over 
there who know the facts.
News from Here and There
This business of checking the 
outpourings and sad wails of the 
nations college newspapers is get
ting monotonous. Take this ques
tion of voting at campus elections. 
Sure, its good to have that old 
school spirit and the training 
which you receive in the forma
tion of the noble habit is good 
for the country, but must every 
editor beg for votes in the same 
tone? We still havent recovered 
from last weeks banner headlines 
demanding the presence of one 
and all at the forthcoming elec
tion of Joe No vs. Smo for Graft 
Chairman of Stoogent Council. 
And now theyre at it again!
On the other hand, the interest 
which most of the papers (this 
one excepted) are showing in the 
serious Franco situation is indeed 
welcome. Schools, such the the 
University of Detroit, which are 
of a clerical nature have been at
tacking the State Departments 
mild censure of the Spanish gov
ernment for weeks. Other schools 
of a different nature have begun 
to turn their editorial lights 
against the dictator. Both sides 
are strongly opinionated, except for

by a veteran and his wife) which 
claims that although Franco is

That isnt all. Mrs. Pick also has
many stray objects in her office
on the ground floor of Maggie
Murph. Will all you absent-mind[continued on p. 7]
have the right to interfere. The 
validity of the various arguments 
is of course something for the 
individual to decide, but encour
agement can be derived from the 
amount of space the question is 
receiving. Apparently the Amer
ican student is beginning to lose 
his prejudice about interest in 
world affairs being unfashion
able.
The countrys various collegiate 
flying co-operatives are here to 
stay. New ones are being formed 
every week in colleges through
out the country and most of them 
have succeeded in purchasing one 
or more small light planes. The 
members of these organizations 
are using the aircraft acquired for 
their pleasure and to give instruc
tion at moderate rates to inter
ested students. Considering the 
great number of veterans who 
have received expensive military 
flying instruction and the length 
of time which will be required for 
the Army and Navy to get their 
respective houses in order so that 
their reserves may fly regularly 
to retain proper proficiency, these 
little clubs are doing a great serv
ice beyond the pleasure which the 
members derive from doing some
thing which they enjoy.
The Chronicle of the University 
of Utah contains a type of article 
which has been appearing with in
creasing frequency of late. A 
freshman columnist notes in a vig
orous few inches that the draft 
of teen-age men is bad medicine 
prejudicial to the interests of 
the UN, the budget, the various 
armies of occupation, the reputa
tion of American fairness and in
telligence, the price of pears in 
Powhattenand to the possibilities 
of the writers finishing school 
without an interlude by invita
tion. One can sympathize with 
these earnest beaters of the literary 
drums, but we do need over a 
million men in uniform to dis
charge our present international 
obligations, the draft isnt provid
ing them, and college freshmen 
are reported to be fine material 
for degreasification of pots and 
pans.
That source of exchange column 
sources, the Daily Texan, calls 
attention (on a back page) to an 
almost overlooked news item 
which reports that the Oak Ridge 
atomic bomb plant has started an 
experimental station to harness 
atomic energy for the generation 
of electricity. No statement has 
been made as to'the technique to 
be employed, but the immersion 
of U-235 in a heavily shielded 
tank of water will provide steam in 
an auto-regulating process suita[continued on p. 6]

ed to express my humble opinion.
1. Why cant the d------ inde

There are plenty of independent

TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Meet Dr. Porter9 Head of M&G, 
One of Techs Busiest Men
Dr. J. Porter is one man on 
campus whom everyone meets 
sooner or later, for at the present 
time he is the acting head of the 
Bureau of Measurements and 
Guidance. His office is usually 
filled with students who cant 
make up their minds as to what 
they want to study. These stu
dents may ask Dr. Porter to give 
them a Vocational Guidance test 
to advise them for what they are 
best suited. His work keeps his 
secretary busy marking and filing 
the various tests that are given to 
students from the high schools as 
well as the ones in Tech. The 
Bureau holds a special interest for 
Dr. Porter, because he feels that 
it contributes a great deal to 
the welfare of the school and its 
students by assisting in the selec
tion of the students and affording 
help to them in their studies and 
personal problems.
This red-haired, jovial man was 
born in Texarkana, Arkansas. He 
went from there to the University 
of Virginia, where he received the 
Bachelor of Science and Masters 
Degree. For his graduate work he 
went to Yale, where in 1936 he 
received his doctorate. The work 
of his college years was of suffi
cient caliber to gain him member
ship in the Sigma Xi honorary fra
ternity. He has also had nine ar
ticles published in various scien
tific journals, some of them writ
ten alone and some in collabora
tion with other writers.
Dr. Porter is married and has 
two lovely children, a boy and a 
girl, whose pictures are always on 
his desk. He has several hobbies, 
other than bringing up his chil

his small plot, the size of onethird of a city lot, which won the 
Victory Garden award last year.

Pi Tau Sigma 
Initiates Eight
Friday evening, April 26, eight 
men were initiated into Pi Tau 
Sigma, mechanical engineering 
honorary, after going through a 
pledge period of two weeks. The 
new members are Don Cotton, 
Richard Barker, Robert Detweiler, 
William Schrumm, Samuel Collier, 
George Robinson, Robert Stock, 
and William Haddock. Following 
the initiation ceremonies, held at 
the Carnegie Union a banquet was 
given at which Mr. Willey was 
toastmaster and Mr. Bokman guest 
speaker of the evening. The new 
members will be tapped at the 
Call Day Ceremony on May 4 dur

Junior and Senior classes on a 
basis of their scholastic record, 
engineering ability, and personal

house doing odd jobs of Mr. Fixit. Labor problems, more than 
just a hobby with him, are one of 
his major scholastic interests, and 
he has taught several classes in 
Industrial Relations. He is also 
very much interested in the course 
Human Relations in Industry 
given for the Junior Engineers.
During the war Dr. Porter 
worked with the War Production 
Board on their training program 
as an instructor of Industrial 
Training Methods. For over a 
year and a half he was the pub
lics member of the local War La
bor Board Dispute Panel. The 
board was composed of three mem
bers, a man from Industry, one 
from Labor, and a public represen
tative, the professor from Tech.-
Dr. Porter has been at Tech 
since the fall of 1937 and is fond 
of reminiscing about how the war
time staff fought the battle of 
Pittsburgh. He likes this city 
most of the time, and he thinks it 
one of the most interesting in the 
country. His only complaint is the 
dirt. (But remember Dr. Porter, 
Pittsburgh is famous for its dirt.)
Anytime one of you students 
has any vocational problems and 
are in need of advice, just drop 
into Dr. Porters office and he will 
be happy to help you in any way 
he can. His office is one of the 
friendliest on campus and is there 
for your use.

Robert D. Teasdale
Teasdale Receives 
Alumnus Award 
From Culver
Bob Teasdale, a second semester 
senior in electrical engineering, 
has been announced as the recipi
ent of the McDonald Alumni 
Award, given each year by Culver 
Military Academy to the alumnus 
who has made the most outstand
ing record in college. Bob grad
uated from Culver in 42 and en
tered Tech in the fall of that year. 
This presentation will be made at 
Culvers Cum Laude Exercises on 
Friday, June 7. Bob plans to make 
the trip to Culver, Indiana, to at
tend the commencement exercises 
and to receive the award.
We of Tech all know Bob for his 
pleasing personality. Whenever 
he is around there is never a quiet 
moment for he can always think 
of something to liven up the 
crowd. His campus activities are 
many, including the track team, 
Mens Glee Club, and the honoraries Tau Beta Pi, Alpha Phi Omega, 
and Eta Kappa Nu. His news
paper activities have also figured 
prominently in his extracurricular 
life. During his work on the Tar
tan, he rose to the editorial board 
and the position of copy editor. An 
all-round good man scholastically 
and socially, his record at Tech 
must have made the Culver com
mittees choice an easy one.
The culmination of all the hard 
work that Danny Franks and his 
nelpers have been doing to reacti
vate the Scotch and Soda revue 
will come this Friday night at 8:00 
when the revue, Take It from 
Here, will be given in the Gym. 
The best efforts of Fine Arts stu
dents, Maggie Murphs, and Engi
neers will combine to make the 
show an exciting potpourri of 
dancing, smooth new songs, laughs, 
and glamor. The revue will be 
given before the informal dance in 
Thistle Hall and will last approxi
mately an hour and a half. The 
charge of admission will be in
cluded in the $6.00 price of the 
Carnival ticket.
Vocal soloists in the production 
include Judy Lambert, Bill Thunhurst, Gerry Jedd, Helen Leerberg, a duo of Helen Miller and 
Tom OMalley, and a quartet: 
Scotty Atkinson, Lois Slessinger, 
Phil Petrikin, and Ren Orkin. 
Jay Maratta will lead the student 
orchestra through the snappy ar
rangements by Maratta and Dick 
Hoch of originals by Kenny Welsh 
and standards by Cole Porter, Jer
ome Kern, and others. The chorus, 
directed by Jane Culp and Tom 
OMalley, will render novel inter
pretations of the numbers. It is 
rumored that the script by Motyl, 
Crantz, and Checco is hilarious.
Friday night the amount of the 
prize to be awarded for the best 
script and score submitted for next 
years Scotch and Soda revue will 
be announced.
Pi Delta Epsilon Holds Rank 
As Oldest Journalism Honorary
James Schmitt, a student in the 
Drama Department, has been as
signed the leading role in the 
Pittsburgh Playhouses forthcom
ing and final subscription produc
tion, The Front Page.
Schmitt is back in Tech after 
serving several years with a GI 
entertainment unit in Calcutta, 
India. There he had much practic
al experience in addition to work
ing under the able direction of 
screen star Melvin Douglas.
The newspaper melodrama, in 
which Schmitt plays the fabulous 
Hildy Johnson, opens May third 
and will run for three weeks. Ben 
Hecht and Charles MacArthur, 
two former Chicago newspaper 
reporters, wrote The Front 
Page, basing it on actual experi
ences they had as scribes. The 
play is set in the press room of 
the Criminal Courts Building in 
Chicago. Frederick Burleigh has 
designed the setting and directed 
the play.
One of Techs lesser known but 
most respected honoraries is Pi 
Delta Epsilon. After a bit of re
search, we brought to light a num
ber of interesting facts about this 
organization.
Pi Delta Epsilon is the oldest 
collegiate journalism honorary in 
the United States. It was founded 
in 1909 at Syracuse University in 
New York and now boasts fortytwo local chapters at various col
leges and universities. An honor
ary and service fraternity, it was 
founded to give recognition of the 
merit of campus journalists, to aid 
in furthering interest in campus 
publications, and to improve the 
quality of their work. At some 
schools it sponsors all of the pubMemorial Concert Held 
For Dr. Harvey Gaul
As a posthumous tribute, a gala 
concert at the Stephen Foster Me
morial last Wednesday night was 
devoted entirely to the works of 
the late Dr. Harvey Gaul, wellknown Pittsburgh composer. The 
concert was sponsored by the 
Pittsburgh committee of the Har
vey Gaul Scholarship.
Among the mfiny musical., organ
izations that gatferd to h*0nor Dr. 
Gaul and sing his music were the 
Civic String Orchestra, the Tues

lications on campus. It also plays 
a prominent part in setting up na
tional journalistic standards.
At Tech, PiDE is primarily an 
honorary although during the war 
it sponsored the publication of the 
Handbook. At present it is en
gaged in assisting in the reactiva
tion of the Tri-Publications Com
mittee. The principal require
ment for membership is two years 
active service on a collegiate pub
lication or the holding of an ex
ecutive position thereon. In our 
chapter, Jo Sunseri is President, 
and Clara Herron is the Secretary.
The Grand National Secretary 
of Pi Delta Epsilon is Edward E.

Questions of Interest to Vets
The following series of questions 
and answers is designed to answer 
some of the most important prob
lems confronting the college-at
tending veteran today.
Q. Can I borrow on my con
verted NSLI policy, if I should 
ever have to?
A. Yes, you can. Converted 
National Service Life Insurance 
may be borrowed on and carries 
a cash-surrender value. This is 
one of its major advantages over 
term insurance.
Q. I already have a University 
degree. May I do graduate work 
under the G.I. Bill of Rights?
A. Yes. Under the provisions 
of the Bill you may take any 
course of training you wish so 
long as it is at an institution ap
proved by the Department of Pub
lic Instruction.
Q. Under what circumstances is 
a parent classified as a dependent?
A. Dependency will be allowed 
if the parents do not have an in
come sufficient to provide reason
able maintenance for themselves 
and members of their family un
der legal age.
Q. If a veteran who has been 
granted a disability pension suf
fers an increase in the severity of 
ailment, does his pension also in
crease?
A. Yes. The rate of increase in 
compensation will depend upon the 
increase of his disability.
Q. When a veteran is dissatis
fied with the decision on his claim, 
what recourse has he?
A. He may either submit addi
tional evidence to the agency 
wrhere he originally filed the claim, 
or, he may within one years time, 
enter an appeal to the Board of 
Veterans Appeals.

Fete Senior Girls
Last Wednesday April 24, the 
Pittsburgh Womens Clan held 
their annual party for the senior 
girls in Thistle Hall. Miss Eleanor 
Reismeyer, the President of the 
Clan, spoke a few words of intro
duction to the group. The theme 
for the evening was an old-time 
theater party, complete with the 
booing and hissing of the villain. 
The movies included an original 
Our Gang comedy short, another 
quick one with Bebe Daniels play
ing the lead, and a four-reeler 
starring Clara Bow. Since the 
movies were of the silent type, a 
piano accompanist played appro
priate music throughout the 
show. Before the pictures began, 
bags of peanuts and popcorn balls 
were distributed, all of which 
added to the wide variety of odd 
sounds heard throughout the 
evening.
Employment
The Phillip Morris Com
pany is seeking students to 
serve as representatives to 
work outside the Pittsburgh 
area during the summer vaca
tion. The job will consist of 
passing out cigarettes for one 
and a half hours a day and 
will pay $25.00 a month.

Queen and her court. All the 
honoraries will make their calls 
for new members at this time.
Following lunch Saturday, the 
big Sweepstakes finals will be 
held. The winners of the various 
preliminary heats of Friday, will 
meet in this colorful race to deter
mine the champion. Beginning at 
2:30 in front of Maggy Murph, the 
competing buggies will head up 
past the gym, into and down 
through Schenley Park, and back 
again along the side of Industries 
and Skibo to cross the finish line 
just a little further on. Booths 
and carnival will be open on the 
Cut for the remainder of the aft
ernoon.
Coronation, Races, Dance on Sat.
The climax to the weekend 
comes Saturday evening in the 
semi-formal dance held at 9:00 in 
the Gym, George Olsens orchestra 
with his Music of Tomorrow 
providing the dancing music. This 
will be the one semi-formal affair 
of the year at which flowers and 
corsages will be permitted. Fol
lowing this big dance, the fraterni
ties are planning breakfasts at 
their houses. This will finish the 
festivities of the week-end.
Tickets Still on Sale 
Tickets for Carnival will be on 
sale all week, at many places on 
campus. A booth, located in front 
of Skibo, will be the center of 
sales all week. In addition to 
this, the Ticket Committee is or
ganized to contact all the groups 
of students and help put the sale 
over. To really make this first 
post-war Spring Carnival a suc

aside their books for this one

Featured in the issue will be 
the Campus Queen and her court. 
This will be the first announce

The coronation ceremony will be 
held in the Sylvan Theater Satur
day morning at 11:00.
Also in the issue will be the 
program for Carnival, and fea
tures on previous years Spring 
Carnivals. In addition to being the 
best issue of the year, this Scottie 
will contain more material than 
any previous issue.
Notice
A gold-link bracelet, with 
green,. orange, and yellow 
agates was lost last week in 
Thistle Hall by Miss Winches
ter, a Secretarial teacher in 
Margaret Morrison. As the 
bracelet is very valuable, she 
is offering a reward for its re
turn.
Considerable interest in the 
founding of a CIT Chapter of the 
Society for Advancement of Man
agement was manifested at a meet
ing of students in the Department 
of Management Engineering. 
Speaking to a group of twentyfive, Mr. J. D. Thompson, of the 
Pittsburgh Chapter of the Society, 
described the S. A. M. and its 
functions, and outlined the ad
vantages of membership for stu
dents. As a first step in the or
ganizing of a chapter here at Tech, 
five students were given subsidized 
memberships in the local branch. 
They will foster and promote 
further student interest and act 
as a nucleus for the formation of 
a unit here.
The proposed organization will 
be similar in its functions and ac
tivities to the various other en
gineering society chapters on the 
campus. It will do for manage
ment students what the schools 
chapters of the American Societies 
of Chemical, Civil, and Mechani
cal Engineers, the American In
stitute of Electrical Engineers, and 
the Metallurgists and Miners So
ciety do for those in their re
spective departments.
The next meeting of the group 
in the form of a smoker will be 
held in the Carnegie Union, Mon
day May 6, at 8:00 P. M. The 
speaker of the evening will be Mr.

and Fred Detzel.
Sing and Swing
[Continued from p. 1] 
a good bit more wide open than 
the sorority trials, with the men of 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon winning eas
ily on the strength of good har
mony and a neat little novelty 
number going by the name of 
Your Mustache. The Delts came in 
second with a medley of Negro 
spirituals and a very humorous 
and well-acted version of Coney 
Island Baby. The audience enjoyed 
this one immensely as it did many 
of the other songs which were in
terpreted in a lighter vein. The 
tuxedo-clad Betas and the Theta 
Xis, led by the powerful voice of 
music major Charles Tritle also 
made a fine showing. The Tau 
Delts made a good showing also, 
their best number being June Is 
Bustin Out All Over from Ca
rousel.
Although it is customary for 
audiences to behave poorly dur
ing events as long as the Sing, the 
quality of the presentations and 
the refreshingly youthful serious
ness of the participants held ev
eryone reasonably attentive and 
gave the various organizations an 
equal chance to do their best, 
from the opening Chi Omegas to 
the last notes of the Theta Xis 
final sing. Everyone then adjourn
ed in a pushing way to the gym.
The background for the dance 
as provided by the decorations 
committee was the best so far this 
semester. In addition to the usual 
radial streamers >otf crepe paper, a 
revovling mirrored ball, and 
panels of the replicas of the pins 
painted below the bandstand, con
verted our favorite barn into a 
good ballroom. The stage was then 
well set for a good band and a 
good dance. Jimmy Kaye (no re
lation to Sammy) and his charm
ing vocalist trod lightly on the 
fast numbers.
The affair ended at one in the 
morning and the Greeks dispersed 
with their brothers and sisters to 
siich scenes as the Villa DEste, the 
Penn-Shady Cocktail Lounge, and 
the Anchorage to conclude the eve
ning with some well-earned re
freshments.

TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Varsities Cop One, Lose Two Saturday
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
While standing around the football field Saturday, watch
ing Bill Donohoe put his charges through their paces, I got 
into a conversation with one of Techs rooters who was around 
in 1938 when the, joint was jumping. He went to the Sugar 
Bowl to cheer the team on, and all he had to say on the sub
ject was, Boy, what a drunken orgy that.was! It also turns 
out that this fan walked into the 
game itself carrying a case of 
Coca-Cola, half of which was filled 
with the necessary ingredients to 
make rum cokes. During his short 
stay, he ran up a hotel bill of 
$59$20 for the room and $39 
for damages to the hotel. He had 
a good time, though, and finally 
got back to Tech on the 15th of 
Januarytwo weeks after the 
game was over. Oh, well, the Su
gar Bowl is a long way from Pitts
burgh. (How are you, Al?)
Moses Fields Tennis Team Anyway
Three cheers for Mr. Frank 
Moses, the tennis coach, who man
aged to get a team on the field last 
Saturday, with absolutely 0 co
operation from outside influences.
In the absence of Techs courts,
Mr. Moses took the boys to other 
courts in the city to give them a 
chance to work out.
In all fairness to our track team,
the boys went up against the 
Pitt reserves Saturday. From 
this, it sounds as though they took 
a beating from Pitts unknowns.
Well, the only difference between 
the Pitt Reserves and the Pitt Var
sity is four sprinters and a miler 
who went to the Penn Relays. Pitt 
won the dashes anyway, Saturday, 
so that even with their other men 
present, the score wouldnt have 
[been much different. I think the 
'Tech team is in for a cheer or 
two.
Kohn is Reeedd Hot
Stan Kohn was the warmest 
man on the cold field at the Track 
Meet Saturday. He had smeared 
Some Hot-Stuff on himself and 
was burning up while everybody 
else was freezing. Incidently,
Stan, after numerous conferences 
with himself, finally decided to 
enter the broad jump. He won it.
Bill Beamer was so surprised at 
Bill Beamer that his usual finishline grin turned to a roar of 
laughter as he crossed the line 
thirty yards in front of the field 
in the mile Saturday.
Intramural
Roundup
Life on the intramural side of 
the fence has cooled off to a roar
ing blaze this week what with the 
completion of bowling, badminton, 
and soccer. That leaves softball as 
the big doins now. The T.N.T.s, 
featuring Lew Heiles and com
pany slaughtered the D.U.s by the 
one-sided score of 20 (count em, 
folks, 20) to 6. Even with the 14- 
inch ball that is in use these days, 
home runs were the order of the 
day.
Over on the adjoining field, the 
A.I.E.E.s and the Sigma Nus were 
battling it out. At the end of the 
regulation seven innings; the 
A.I.E.E. held a 9-8 lead but the 
winner of the game is still a ques
tion because the game is under 
protest due to a wierd play in the 
fifth inning. The Intramural Board 
has refused to allow the protest 
on the grounds of the Umpires 
testimony, but at the time of the 
meeting, neither of the two teams 
concerned had a representative 
present, so they are getting to
gether early in the week to decide 
among themselves.
Other games of the day, featur
ed the drubbing of Welch Hall by 
the Phi Kaps, 25-12 and the S.A.E. 
victory over the Delts by a score 
of 10-9.
On Thursday, hostilities were 
again resumed. The feature of the 
day came in the S.A.E.-T.X. game. 
The S.A.E.s held a 9-5 lead as the 
T.X.s came to bat in the last of 
the seventh. Then it started. The 
home club battered 5 runs across 
the plate to win, 10-9.
In a free-scoring affair, the 
Dorm Combine edged out the Citcom team by a 20-9 count. The Pi 
K.A.s whipped the Betas 7-3 in 
the only other game scheduled.
Golfers Drop Opener 
To Geneva College
Carnegie Techs golf team met with rather stiff oppositioni
in their opening match with Geneva College and had their 
opening marred by defeat. The match was played at the Blackhawk Golf Course. Score of the match was 91/-51/2. Davidson 
and Firestone for Geneva managed to sweep their series over 
Vic Elliott and Norm Zuerner giving Geneva 6 of their 9V2 
Joints. For Tech Lowinger made In case there is anyone in 
i clean sweep of Genevas number doubt as to the method of scoring 
ive man, and Arnie Christenson 
nanaged to shade their number 
)ne man Morrow to win nine holes 
md the match. Bob Wissner tied 
Genevas number two man over 
nine holes but dropped the other 
md the match. Low medal for the 
natch was 85 by Davidson.

used in match play, the teams are 
seeded as to number one man and 
so forth. In the play, winner of 
each nine holes over the course 
receives one point. Winner of the 
match wins a point making a pos
sible top score of three. For ex
ample if a man rounds the course 
in 38 for his first nine holes as 
against a 42 for the opponent he 
receives a point. However if he 
drops the second by a score of 37 
to 42 he also loses a point and the 
match by the score of 80 to 79. 
Close, Huh. Anyway this will 
give you the rough idea.
Yesterday the team met West 
Virginia at the Field Club. For 
score read next weeks Tartan 
(this one has already gone to 
press). On Friday Tech meets 
Slippery Rock. Why not make a 
journey out to the club and watch 
the boys show their stuff.
Lineup::
Coach Frank Moses tennis team 
opened its 1946 campaign against 
Thiel College at Greenville last 
Saturday, and, though they had 
had very little practice, the Tar
tans rolled over the home team 
by a score of 5-1.
Geneva Wins Only One Match
The team has been without 
courts to play on in this area so far 
and for most of the boys it was 
there first time on courts this 
year. Nevertheless, things went
O.K. and the victory was very 
pronounced. The only Thiel win 
came when Jocoy and Gomes of 
Thiel edged out Corky Dunn and 
Schoenberger of Tech in a mara
thon set by a score of 10-8
Harmuth Sweeps Opponent
In the other matches, Jittery 
Joe Harmuth, Techs captain for
the day, beat Passilano of Thiel
easily by scores of 6-4, 6-2 while 
Sellke was having even less trou
ble disposing of Nestor of Thiel 
by 6-0,6-4.
DePrima Takes Three Sets To Win
Dick DiPrima ran into trouble 
with Thiels Dittner as the lat
ter took the first set, 6-4, but
DiPrima rallied to win the next
two 7-5, 6-2. In the final singles 
match Meyers of Tech took the 
measure of Gomes 6-4, 6-3.
Harmuth teamed with Tony Arrott to shade Pessalano and Nes
tor 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.
Eight Matches To Go
The team faces a tough sched
ule of eight more matches in the 
coming three weeks. Heres hop
ing the Administration gets on the 
ball and gives them some courts 
to play on.
The boys who played Saturday 
were only part of the squad as the 
team has not been fully picked 
yet. There are about ten other 
promising netsters still battling 
for places on the vasity.
Summary
SinglesHarmuth defeated Pessalano,6-4, 6-2. Sellke defeated Nestor, 6-0, 6-4. Meyers defeated Gomes, 6-4, 6-3. DiPrima defeated Dittner, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2.DoublesArrott and Harmuth (C) defeated Pessalano and Nestor (T), 6-4,2-6, 6-4. Jocoy and Gomes (T) defeated Dunn and Schoenberger (C), 10-8.
Tennis Courts? 
Yeh, But When
All right, all right. Weve waited 
long enough! Here comes some
thing which is on a lot of peoples 
minds these days. WHEN ARE 
THE TENNIS COURTS GOING 
TO BE READY? There are a lot of 
people who have been let down by 
the administrations policy of 
watchful waiting on the subject 
including the varsity tennis 
team. How is a school supposed to 
meet its schedule with no place 
to play on and not even a place 
to practice on. Mr. Moses has done 
a good job in getting out a team, 
by taking the boys out to various 
courts in the area for a little prac
tice, but he cant do it forever.
First the excuse was that there 
was no equipment, now they say 
that there is no labor available. 
Oh, brother! The athletic depart
ment has been after the parties 
concerned but with no results. 
Why no results? Mr. Keck has 
been in the hospital, so he cant be 
expected to do the job, but cer
tainly he has an assistant or a 
SUPERIOR. (How about it, Mil
ler?)
Where do the students rate 
around here? Those are Har-tru 
all-weather courts and could have 
been ready almost a month ago. 
And yet they want $2.00 to play 
on them!
Our brethren from atop the Oakland Hill came over to the 
Tech Bowl Saturday long enough to trip the Tech track team 
691/2-561/2. While Pitt was minus five of their clan who went 
to the Penn relays, they had enough in reserve to lick the 
Skibos on the cold, windswept Carnegie oval.
Sherwood Rides Again the time the bar got up to ten feet,
Jack Sherwood started the Skiso Wares first jump came at, ~  ,__. . 10'2". He cleared it with easebos off to a flymg start as he , ..   ,, ,, , .,while Haller couldnt do it, sostepped over the high hurdles in 
the amazing time of 15.8 seconds. 
One of the watches got him in 15.5 
which proves that the Long One 
was really on his way.
Soon after, Bill Beamer took 
the post for the Mile run to carry 
the Tartan hopes against several 
Pitt runners. Bill stayed in his 
accustomed position right on the 
leaders heels throughout the race, 
took over the lead on the far turn 
of the final lap and ran away from 
the field so fast they looked like 
they were standing still. Rapid 
William was clocked in 4:46 or 
thereabouts.
Kindi Takes 440
After Carr had disposed of the 
Century for Pitt, the quartermilers lined up and put on a 
spectacular show. Stan Kohn 
grabbed the lead for Tech at the 
first turn and held it throughout 
the back stretch, when Schaeffer 
and Bergman of Pitt passed him. 
Bob Kindi, Techs favorite in the 
event was boxed between these 
two, but by the grace of the ele
ments, managed to snake his way 
through on the rail and pass Berg
man. Schaeffer flew around the 
final turn and looked like the win
ner, but Kindi was not to be de
nied. For the first time this year, 
Bob had enough left to put on a 
spurt at the finish and he passed 
the Pitt ace in the final ten yards 
to give Tech the win. The time 
was 53.4.
Sherwood again brought home 
the beacon in the 120 low hurdles 
and Riehl took first in the highjump for Tech, but at this point 
the results of the weight events 
started coming in and the situa
tion began to darken for the Ski
bos. Omelia of Pitt took both 
the shot put and the discus and 
Griffin practically sewed up the 
meet when he took the Javelin 
with a heave of 168'4". Notice
able was the absence of Bill Scott 
in the scoring column for Tech. 
Scotty, who scored a triple win 
against Case in these events, had 
been out for football practice in 
the morning and was just plain 
tired. Bill Thunhurst carried 
the torch for Tech through these 
events and racked up four points 
for the home cause. Ware of Tech 
was busy taking second in the 
shot, so that he was late for the 
pole vault. Everyone else but 
Haller of Pitt had dropped out by
Tech had five more points.
880 A Thriller
The hottest race of the afternoon 
came in the 880. Davies grabbed 
the lead for the home team and 
held it until the back stretch of 
the final lap when Anderson of 
Pitt took over. Anderson stretch
ed his margin to five yards around 
the final turn, and Davies looked 
like he was through, BUT the 
four-eyed one found his lost wind 
and put on a sensational burst of 
speed to bring himself up to An
dersons heels. The Pitt flyer 
thought he would patrol the road 
at this point and crossed lanes to 
keep the challenger at bay in the 
last five yards. Despite the foul, 
Davies came on to win.
In the broad jump, Stan Kohn, 
jumping for the first time this 
year, showed the boys how as he 
leaped 18.35' the first jump and 
fouled the next three times. That 
jump stood up, though, and Stan 
emerged the winner.

Tech fans will get their first 
chance to see the 1946 edition Sat
urday. Coach Bill Donohoe has an
nounced that the boys will com
pete in an intra-squad game, Sat
urday, May 4, in the Tech Bowl 
at 10 in the morning. This event 
will be incorporated as part of 
Spring Carnival, and the Corona
tion and Call Day have been push
ed to 12 noon to allow everyone to 
be on hand for the ball game.
First call for the football squad 
went out last Tuesday. Legally, 
there are about 60 names on the 
roster. The boys have worked on 
the fundamentals this week and
have been running off a few plays. 
For all those who havent heard, 
Tech will run from the T this 
fall, so dont be surprised if you 
cant see the ball.
Head Coach Donohoe has named 
for his assistants two of Techs 
former football greats, Virgil Cantini and Bill Kuenzli. He is also 
getting help from Mr. Walter 
Burns who needs no introduction 
to the people hereabouts. Al Ir
win, former Tech freshman coach, 
is the ace-assistant to Donahue. 
He and Kuenzli are combining 
forces to produce a good Tartan 
line next fall.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1946
*^^-^G!RLS
Pat Kelsey
Petite is one of the most over
used words there is, but it also 
happens to be the only single 
word in the English language that 
can adequately describe Patricia 
Kelsey. If we wanted to use more 
than i ? word to describe fivefoot-one Pat, we could say she is 
a charming, vivacious brunette 
who talks with her eyes, but our 
lovely lady is the essence of 
petiteness, so our original descrip
tion can stand as it is.
Pat, a senior in the home eco
nomics department of Margaret 
Morrison, wants to design clothes. 
After she graduates she is going 
to rest over the summer and then 
take that trip to New York, the 
clothing capital of the world. But 
only certain types of clothes will 
receive her skilled attention; 
dresses like Renes (you know 
the ones without tops). Evening 
clothes are out because she claims, 
There isnt enough to work with.
Pats activities include the pres
idency of Kappa Kappa Gamma, 
and social chairmans post on 
Mortar Board. She has joined the 
Home Economics Club and is a 
past member of Dormitory Coun
cil.
One of those outdoor sports 
girls, Pat works hard at riding, 
swimming, and grand slams at 
bridge. She likes to spend those 
precious summer vacations at a
Exchange
little place called Flat Havens; 
near the village of Van Buren 
Point, New York. Her indoor rec
reations are also thoroughly di
versified. She is equally stirred 
by Hairless Joe and Lonesome 
Polecat of Ll Abner fame, the 
Rubiyat of Omar Khyam, and Dr. 
Shoens stirring remarks about 
the real values which the Greeks 
of Socrates days upheld. Being a 
loyal student of Carnegie Tech, 
she rates the novels of Gladys 
Schmidt high on her reading list. 
On the other side of the pleasure 
fence are characters who eat gar
lic on trains and then sit behind 
her (she inhaled that exotic aroma 
for eight hours recently).
However, all of these activities 
and pleasures are normal with 
most students at our busy school. 
But Pat can claim something else 
which is indeed rare here and 
which sets her apart from the 
usual Techite. She likeswe re
peatlikes this school and will 
be sorry to graduate! Yes, we 
have finally found one who is 
happy here, as was predicted by 
the Gaussian distribution. This 
interview will undoubtedly win 
Pat a very pretty Greek letter 
award at least.

The University of Houston has 
announced that it is sponsoring 
the first Summer Center in Guat
emala for American students. It 
will be the first such center ever 
opened in that Central American 
Republic by an American college. 
The school, which will open June
3, will offer courses in English 
and in social, economic, and cul
tural conditions in Guatemala. 
Students attending will leave 
Houston by train and bus for 
Mexico C. y and from there 
will fiy to Guatemala City where 
they will study in co-oper
ation with the University of 
Guatemala. Standard college cred
it in junior sociology or his
tory will be offered, but students 
or non-students can attend on a 
no credit basis. The approximate 
total cost for the Guatemala Sum
mer Study Center will be $300, in
cluding transportation, food, hous
ing, and field trips.
Are you having trouble making
the ends of your budget come 
within shouting distance of each 
other? Students at Indiana Uni
versity paid a mere seventy-five 
cents a week for board and a dol
lar per semester for a roomin 
1844.
This one is inserted for the 
benefit of the bigger men on cam
pus and the four point boys. If 
you want to live to a ripe old 
age, this business of working for 
fame and such is not good, for 
(and we have the word of the 
Temple University News for this 
which in turn got the information 
from a leading sociologist) a study 
of the Americans listed in Whos 
Who indicated that these great 
and near-great people were not 
reaching their life expectancy. 
The reasons for these shortened 
lives, he explained, were the men
tal strain, the lack of exercise, and 
general and continuous condi
tions of overwork and erratic 
hours. Ordinary persons who lead 
retiring lives are free from the 
harassments of prominence and 
stand a good chance of reaching 
their appointed three score and 
ten. Our late President and his 
predecessors Harding and Wilson 
are good examples of early deaths 
caused by overactive lives.
The University of Kentucky has 
one of the best problems yet pre
sented. There is just too much 
open cooperative courting (neck
ing if you wish to be blunt) on 
campus, and the school authori
ties and the newspaper editor are 
both annoyed and ashamed of the 
students. Now frankly, there is 
nothing better in this world than 
a good five cent cigar.
Tuberculosis is occupying the 
medical attentions of the Univer
sity of Syracuse. The school will 
attempt shortly to X-ray all 9,000 
of its personnel in eight days, us
ing the most modern equipment 
available, for detection of tuber
culosis in its early stages'has been 
proved to be of great value in 
assuring a complete and final cure 
of the disease. The Syracuse Stu
dent Health Service hopes that 
its action on this matter will stim
ulate similar X-ray check-up pro
grams throughout the country.

TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
FRAT FLASHES
The Greeks on campus really 
took over this past week-end 
need we say more?
The Pi KAs had a big dinner 
party before Sing and Swing 
Candle lights and flowers . . .
Also in the dinner-before-thedance department were the Theta 
Xis.
After their meeting last Wed
nesday evening, the Thetas held 
one of their firesides, including re
freshments, singing, and gab fests.
Wednesday evening the Chi 
Omegas and the Sigma Kappas in
stalled their new officers for the 
coming year.
Some of the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lons attended a dance given by 
the nurses at Columbia hospital. 
Four of the SA.E.s attended a 
province convention in Harris
burg last weekend.
Friday night the Delt pledges 
gave a Kiddie party. The house 
was decorated for the affair 
marbles, kites, diapers* etc.
The D. U.s also had an enter
taining Kiddie party Friday night.
Wednesday afternoon the Sigma 
Kappas will attend a tea given 
by the alumni which will be held 
at Mrs. Manwilers home on Glad
stone Road.
The Tri Delts held initiation 
Thursday and Friday. One of 
their National Officers was present. 
The initiation was followed by a
Mens Glee Club 
Sings for Alumni
Last Friday evening the Car
negie Tech Mens Glee Club made 
its last official appearance of the 
season in presenting the program 
for a Carnegie Tech Alumni Con
vention at Youngstown, Ohio.
Approximately twenty members 
of the Club left CIT at 4:00 P. M. 
last Friday in a chartered Grey
hound bus, which was more or less 
appropriately covered with in
formation urging enlistment in the 
Womens Marine Reserve Corps. 
The group arrived at 6:30 P. M. 
and after an enjoyable chicken 
dinner sang before a group of 125 
alumni, who seemed to find the 
program quite entertaining. Dean 
(of Women) Yon and several de
partment heads from Fine Arts 
were also present.
After the Club finished singing 
the Tech songs, Don Wilkens play
ed Golliwogs Cakewalk by De
bussy and Ravels Minuet. Clif
ford Taylor, student director, then 
led the Club in Stout-hearted 
Men by Romberg, I Love Life, 
and The Lords Prayer by Malotte. Charles Tritle then offer
ed as solo numbers, Clarinda, 
Give a Man a Horse He Can 
Ride, and Three for Jack. The 
Club then presented a triad of sec
ular numbers: The Jolly Ranger, 
The Sleigh, and What Shall 
We Do With a Drunken Sailor. 
After some group singing with 
the alumni, and the singing of the 
Alma Mater, the Club returned to 
Tech via bus.
On Monday, May 13, at 6:00 P. 
M., the Mens Glee Club will hold 
their annual banquet at the Uni
versity Club. At this time keys 
will be awarded and the results 
of elections for next fall announc
ed.
This year must be considered 
quite successful, when one con
siders that the club started from 
scratch with its reorganization. 
In this accomplishment, orchids 
hould go to Cliff Taylor, student 
irector, Harry Thor, club manaer, Don Wilkens, capable acompanist, and Paul Brautigam, 
enior director. The organization 
s looking forward to an even 
ore successful season next year.
party at the Club House.
The Tau Delts and and Beta 
Sigs attended a tea given by the 
Phi Sigma Sigma Sorority at Pitt.
Before Sing and Swing the Tau 
Delts gave a banquet in honor of 
Dr. Moskovitz.
Another Pitt affair attended by 
a Tech group was given by the Pitt 
Phi Delts in honor of their sister 
fraternity, the Delta Gammas. The 
party was held last Wednesday.
And of course, all the fraterni
ties (both mens and womens, 
that is) entered the stiff compe
tition in Greek Sing and Swing. 
Each group entered a team, com
posed of members numbering from 
four to twelve. A few of the 
braver sang without a director, 
but the most common was to have 
a director. We didnt envy the 
judges in picking th winning 
group, but were sure their selec
tion makes hearty congratulations 
to the Kappa Kappa Gamma and 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon in order.
The Sigma Nus had a picnic in 
Schenley Park Sunday.

with his eye constantly on ballot 
box has 'by the removal of ration
ing so disgustingly bungled the 
food distribution situation that 
both the United States and Europe 
are without proper supplies of 
certain food items. If our great 
leader had not underestimated the 
capacity for sacrifice of the citi
zenry of America and had main
tained the rationing system entire, 
both Europe and the United States 
might now have enough to eat. 
Our Congress too has just reached 
a decision of such importance that 
it will undoubtedly go down in 
history. Despite the fact that at 
least 80 per cent of the mail re
ceived by legislators favored the 
continuation of OPA and the pre
vention of inflation, great minded 
altruistic congressmen, hands on 
pocket books, and eyes steadily 
on republican and democratic cof
fers have shackled the hands of 
the directors of the Office of Price 
Administration.
Soon the nations of the world 
will again be selling the raw ma
terials for new implements of war 
to one another and soon they will 
again be picking quarrels with one 
another. Soon the economic crisis 
at home and abroad will again be 
upon us. You have the opportu
nity to choose your destiny: Death 
by starvation or death by the 
atomic bomb. Rosy future! ! !
Joel Bigelman
No, he doesnt have a Spanish 
accent, but nevertheless Joel Big
elman can claim as his birthplace 
and home Havana, Cuba. In fact 
he said that after he graduates, 
which will be in September, 1946, 
if he doesnt do graduate work, 
he is going back to Cuba to ex
ploit the natives.
Joel, better known as Chico 
Gringo Igor (beaver?) el Senior, 
is a member of Theta Tau and is 
now recording secretary of Tau 
Beta Pi, of which he was an honor 
Junior. He also belongs to Pi Del
ta Epsilon, is President of Alpha 
Phi Omega, is managing editor of 
the Technical, and a member of 
AIEE. He is pledging Eta Kappa 
Nu and was in the Glee Club and 
advertising manager of the Tar
tan. Joel also has participated in 
intramural baseball and vollyball. 
His favorite office however is that 
of secretary of Tau Delta Phi. It 
seems that his heart is not only in 
his work but also in his fraternity.
Joel chose Tech over Cornell 
because he thought it was a bet
ter school. Surprisingly enough he
Concert To Be Held 
In Wilkinsburg Church
On the thirtieth of April, at 
8:30, the Womens Glee Club will 
present a concert at the United 
Brethren Church in Wilkinsburg. 
The program, which is open to 
the public, will be composed of 
both secular and sacred songs. Al
so included on the program will 
be Two Clocks, a novelty number, 
Erie Canal, and I Wonder As I 
Wander, American Folk Tunes, 
and ballads such as How Lovely 
Is Thy Dwelling Place, The Snow, 
At Times My Thoughts Come 
Drifting, and Jesus Joy and Mans 
Desiring.
hasnt changed his mind, though 
with a factor of 3.2 this is under
standable.
The type of femininity he 
likes is also easily understanda
ble, though where he hopes to find 
one to meet his standards is a 
mute question. He wants a blonde 
dramat who is quiet, co-operative, 
intelligent, and who likes both to 
listen to classical music and to 
dance.
Igor says he wishes that he had 
some spare time because there are 
so many things he has always 
wanted to do, like reading litera
ture, listening to music, and ietting all the things he has learned 
assimilate in his brain so that hell 
be able to understand them. Most 
of all however Joel wants some 
free time so he can take a vaca
tion, seems he hasnt had one in 
quite some time.
Joes interests include blondes, 
loud shirts, dramats, fast Cuban 
rumbas, and classical romantic 
music. Concerning the latter he 
likes Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven 
as well as such moderns as Sibellius and Shostakovich.
One of the things h doesnt 
care for is people who ccine back 
to campus and expect high posi
tions in campus organizations 
without having done any work 
to earn the positions. He also 
doesnt care for politics, though 
he mixes in them anyway.
What Joel would like to see on 
campus is another hut, so he can 
dance, and a rest room for boys 
between classes, it seems he likes 
to take his siesta. He also says he 
has nothing against the Soc-Rel 
program, except the way it is 
taught.
His frat brothers use such words 
as quiet, studious, efficient, and 
brilliant to describe him. Well 
take their word for this, but only 
after Joel tells how he spent a 
quiet VJ day.

Spring Carnival 
Is Gala Revival
One of the Tech traditions will 
be revived as the first post-war 
Spring Carnival is scheduled for 
the weekend of May 3 and May 4, 
concluding campus week activities.
The Carnival program begins 
with the Scotch & Soda play Take 
It From Here in the gym followed 
by informal dancing in Thistle 
Hall to Joey Sims orchestra. 
Booths and rides will be placed on 
the cut for an all evening enter
tainment. The big event will be 
Call Day and the crowning of the 
campus queen on Saturday.
Climaxing the weekend will be 
a semi-formal dance in the gym to 
George Oken and his famous 
Music of Tomorrow orchestra, 
featuring Ray Adams and the 
lovely Judith Blair.
Tickets for the Carnival week
end are available to all Evening 
Students and may be secured in 
Mr. McKelways office. The price 
is $6.00 including tax.
These affairs are a part of the 
school and one should be glad to 
participate in such a gala occasion 
for which the committee has work
ed so hard to revive.

do, for the affair held in the Roose

of the finest and most successful 
held so far by the Evening En

the Evening School fraternities. 
Max Hannum, toastmaster per ex
cellent, kept things humming from

can say that Max can be rated 
with the best in our book.)

that is always the case when

main delicacies on the menu.
We almost forgot to mention that 
this year as in the past the guests 
were given bags of souvenirs upon 
entering the Gold Room. We are 
going to be mean by not telling 
you of the fine show, etc., staged 
by the Peg Lanagan Theatrical 
agency. Like most good things we 
are going to let the fellows who 
were present tell you about it. 
Dont be bashful, ask a fellow who 
saw the show how he liked it. You 
can bet your bottom dollar it was 
plenty OK. The sad part about 
most banquets is that they fall 
flat at the end but not this one as 
there were fine prizes distributed 
which climaxed the affair with 
SUCCESS.
For those unfortunate enough to 
miss this party they should resolve 
not to miss the next one.

Arlene McMurray 
Eve. Student 
Council Secretaryh
One of the most prominent 
young ladies in Techs Evening 
School is Arlene McMurray. Ar
lene has been registered on the 
campus for the past three years; 
and during that entire period she 
has not only been an industrious 
student,, but has also found time 
to participate in the various activ
ities offered by the Evening 
School. Wherever there is a so
cial gathering of the Evening Stu
dents and their friends, you can 
always find Arlene helping out; 
and as a matter of fact, she served 
as our Social Chairman for some 
time. Indeed it would be difficult
wmmmm
to imagine a successful evening 
event without Arlenes aid, for she 
has done much toward making 
the social life of Carnegie Tech as 
entertaining as possible.
Arlene has held many offices 
while she has been with us 
and has performed her duties 
capably and efficiently. She has 
been a representative on Eve
ning Student Council since her 
first year at Tech and is the pres
ent Secretary of that organization. 
Officiating as President of the 
Evening College of Fine Arts is 
another of her accomplishments. 
For her faithful work on the 
PLAID staff, of which she was 
Associate Editor last year, she was 
chosen to be a member of the na
tional journalistic fraternity, Pi 
Delta Epsilon.
A peek into Arlenes life outside 
of school reveals that she is a 
stenographer for one of Pitts
burghs leading law firms. Her 
ambitious nature will undoubtedly 
make her a success in any field 
she selects.
For diversion she likes swim
ming, dancing, bowling, horse
back riding, and vacationing in 
Florida. Also, she appreciates 
good music (with the exception of 
Gershwin, who is her pet aver
sion).
Arlene likes people, and her in
terest in them is probably one of 
the responsible factors causing 
them to like her; for anyone for
tunate enough to know Arlene 
cannot help liking her. Sincerity, 
fairness, and a keen sense of hu
mor are still other qualities which 
combine to make up the all-around 
personality of this outstanding 
Tech evening student.

Nero played the fiddle while 
Rome burned. In doing so, he set 
a glorious precedent for all suc
ceeding politicians to follow. Of 
course we must have politicians, 
but must rotten politics go hand 
in hand?
What defense of democracy can 
we make to the Europeans who, 
viewing objectively our political 
maneuvering, must certainly feel 
that we are either . . . big fools 
or erven greater hypocrites? Of 
course we have freedom of ex
pression, freedom of this and that 
and so on, ad insanitum. But I 
wonder if it is helping us in the 
least. Along with the freedoms 
mentioned above we have the 
freedom to engage in black market 
buying (not only nylons either), 
to practice our freedom to disre
gard the wishes and needs of 
others less fortunate.
We spent 350 billion dollars on 
the war to save our freedoms, but 
what do we spend to promote de
cent living conditions? Our re
turning veterans are deserving of
the best to paraphrase the con
niving politicians. And so, what 
happens? Barracks, from which 
all GIs foreswore themselves long 
before their discharges, are re 
opened to house the veteran an 
his family.
What a mockery of justice we 
perpetuate! Surely if democrac 
was worthy of a 350 billion dollar 
expenditure we can afford to 
spend the little insignificant sum of 
one billion dollars on rousing pro 
motion. We surprised the world 
by our rapid mobilization for war. 
Cannot we again mobilize for 
peace by federal promotion of 
housing? And I am not speaking 
of lending the money to the build
ing and loan associations to have 
them promote the program. What
I have in mind is general subsidi
zation of the whole building pro
gram under federal supervision. 
Private experts say that the hous
ing shortage will last for ten years. 
Can we wait that long? Will we 
wait that long?
