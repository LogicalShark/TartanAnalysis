Colleges grapple with 
federal anti-drug edicts
Financial aid restriction not a problem here, says Enrollment 
by Brad Grantz Nickels and dimes
byBradGBnGtzBCi
Crime may not pay, but it seems 
that lying does. If a college student 
has been convicted of a drug offense 
but says otherwise on his or her 
financial aid application, he or she 
may reap the benefits of more than 
$14,000 in federal loans for educa
tion.
This year, 30,000 students nation
wide were denied federal grants, 
loans, and work-study under the 
anti-drug provision of the Higher 
Education Act (HEA), a result of a 
1998 amendment of the HEA, 
according to a report published by 
the Department of Education. A con
viction for the distribution or use of 
illegal drugs is currently the only 
crime that will prevent a student 
from receiving federal aid.
Carnegie Mellon administrators 
say the anti-drug provision has had 
nearly no effect on enrollment or 
financial aid costs at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Civil liberties groups and oppo
nents of the drug war have criticized 
the legislation, calling it hypocritical 
and counterproductive. College stu
dents convicted of crimes such as 
rape and murder are still eligible to 
receive the more than $14,000 avail
able for each federal aid applicant.
Graham Boyd, the national director 
of the American Civil Liberties Union 
drug policy litigation network, says 
the law discourages and prevents low 
income individuals from receiving 
aid.

Handling of IMF 
protests by police 
to be reviewed

menBad orpii,dBrCd
Approximately 650 people were 
arrested in Washington, D.C. during 
protests against the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank on 
September 27. The Washington, D.C. 
Police Department assembled a force 
of over 5,350 officers, comprised of 
3,650 Washington police and nearly 
1,700 other officers from approxi
mately two dozen law enforcement 
agencies across the country.
According to Fritz Mulhauser, a 
staff attorney with the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU), later this 
month the District of Columbia City 
Council will hold a hearing on the 
conduct of the police department. 
The ACLU is also currently investigat
ing the events, to determine if the 
police improperly stopped their 
protest and arrested demonstrators 
without proper cause.
Many protesters believed that the 
arrests were unwarranted and unjust, 
that the arrests were not in response 
to any sort of illegal behavior.
It was pretty clear that the pur
pose of the arrests was to intimidate 
other people coming to the rally and 
to keep us from the demonstration. 
We had done nothing wrong. The 
arrests were unjustified, said Matt 
Toups, junior computer science 
major.
The police claimed that they told 
the demonstrators to disperse. But 
protesters believe that they never 
received such an order at any time 
throughout the demonstration.
District of Columbia councilwoman Kathy Patterson expressed 
her concern over the legitimacy of the 
mass arrests.
I have questions, in particular, 
about the arrest of nonviolent 
demonstrators, without warning.... 
Specifically, why was the decision 
made to apparently make these 
arrests without first warning the 
demonstrators to disperse, wrote 
Patterson in a letter to District of 
Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams.
During the demonstration, many 
protesters were encircled by police at 
Pershing Park and Freedom Plaza. 
They were not allowed to leave at all, 
forced to stay there for nearly two 
hours.
They were later placed on buses 
where they remained for more than 
eight hours. Eventually, they were 
processed and formally charged, said 
Toups. Twenty-one CMU students 
were arrested mainly for failure to 
obey a police officers order, he said.
Other demonstrators were arrested 
for various offenses including incom
moding, parading without a permit, 
and destruction of property.
Groups including the ACLU have 
also raised the question of civil rights
pushed to societys margin will not be 
able to get federal aid to improve 
themselves, says Boyd.
In April, Yale University became 
the fourth and most prominent col
lege to openly disagree with the fed
eral law. After three years of student 
lobbying, administrators created a 
policy to reimburse students who lost 
federal aid due to a drug conviction 
for usage (as opposed to distribu
tion), provided they complete a 
mandatory rehabilitation program.
However, less than 40 percent of 
5,300 undergraduates receive feder
al aid at Yale compared to 48.5 per
cent of Carnegie Mellons 5,500 
undergraduate students. For the 
2002-03 school year, only eight per
cent of CMU students who completed 
the Free Application, for Federal 
Student Aid (FAFSA) did not qualify

parents looking over the shoulder of 
would-be CMU students.
Its an uphill battle for smokers. 
Peer comparisons, student statistics, 
and health reports have already led 
the Smoke Free Housing Task Force 
to designate non-smoking status for 
16 of 26 campus buildings.
Major universities like Cornell, 
Northwestern, Stanford, and 
Princeton are implementing more 
smoke-free housing for students, and 
Penn State has made all housing 
locations smoke free.
by Hannah Yi
menBad orpii,dBrCdSince 1996, some of CNBCs research, headed by Carl 
Olson (director of the Primate Physiology Laboratory), 
has involved experimenting on rhesus macaque mon
keys, a species of very social and intelligent monkeys 
that come from Asia; although, James McClelland, the 
co-director of CNBC, said less than half of the centers 
funding goes towards the primate research.
According to Punitha Manavalan, much of CNBCs 
research on monkeys requires invasive techniques, 
which includes removing half of the monkeys skull. 
Manavalan is currently working as a computer pro
grammer in the Mellon Institute for CNBC.
The cranium is taken off. The electrode goes into 
the brain cells, so they need to cut off the top of the cra
nium, the whole thing, she said. She explained that 
this procedure allows Dr. Olson (the only faculty mem
ber authorized to perform the operation) to fit elec
trodes into the monkeys brain, and collect data on the 
functions of different neurons.
The cranium removal is not the only type of invasive 
research that is conducted within the Mellon Institute.
by Anne Jolis
orpii,dBrCdStudent Dormitory Council and 
Housing Services will decide this 
month whether or not to designate 
more smoke-free space on campus. A 
total of 2,024 beds (64 percent of all 
housing) have already been changed 
to nonsmoking since the initiative 
began in fall 2000.
The issue is driven by the cus
tomer and we are seeing higher 
demands for a smoke-free living, 
said Tim Michael, director of housing 
services.
According to Michael, 98 percent
Colleen Gault may disagree with the way the rhesus 
monkeys are kept in the Mellon Institute, but she sees 
the benefits of the brain research that is conducted 
there. Gault is a junior biology and psychology major, 
and one of the few people to have gained access to the 
primate laboratory in the Mellon Institutes Center for 
the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC).
Theyre individually caged, in a colony, which I dont 
think is conducive to normal interactions among the 
monkeys, said Gault, who worked as a monkey trainer 
for three semesters. According to Gault, rhesus mon
keys are social animals by nature.
CNBC was founded in 1994 as a joint project between 
Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, in 
order to study the roots of cognitive processes within 
brain cells. The majority of CNBCs funding comes from 
the National Institute for Mental Health. The National 
Science Foundation and other private companies also 
give money to CNBC.

A ribbon-cutting last Friday kicked 
off an open house of the 
Interdisciplinary Undergraduate 
Science Laboratories, part of the new 
Doherty Hall lab complex. The event 
was held in the new MCS lecture hall, 
Doherty Hall 2302. University 
President Jared Cohon and other par
ties involved in the project addressed 
the planning, construction, and 
future of the eight-story addition that 
should be fully operational by fall 
2003.
Two new classes will be offered 
specifically for interdisciplinary MCS 
students. One class deals with the 
chemistry of crime, where students 
can apply forensic science techniques 
to their study of chemistry and biolo
gy. Students will learn to diagnose 
environmental problems in the other 
course. The labs will also accommo
date elementary school students in 
Carnegie Mellons Outreach pro
gram, along with high school stu
dents from Governors School.
Barry Luokkala, director of under
graduate physics laboratories, said 
students will have a classroom/clus
ter to discuss lab projects, carry out 
the experimentation, and use com
puter modeling to interpret the 
results. He also has activities in store 
for first-year students.

will use the analytical and synthetic

the Doherty chemistry lab is so anti

Pakistan and India 
test nuclear arms
ISLAMABAD (AP)  Nuclear 
, neighbors Pakistan and India con
ducted tit-for-tat missile tests Friday, 
threatening to escalate tension in a 
. region that is once again close to the 
, brink of war.
 Hours after Pakistan tested a surface-to-surface missile capable of car- rying nuclear warheads, and hitting 
most targets inside India, New Delhi 
tested its most sophisticated surfaceto-air missile.
Pakistan warned that India threat
ened to launch South Asia on an arms 
race by conducting a test on the same 
day as its own.
India dismissed Pakistans test as a 
, publicity stunt ahead of next weeks 
general elections, the first in the 
country since the military seized 
power in a 1999 coup.
Each country defended its test as 
i routine and had notified the other of 
its plans in advance.
The tests came during a tense time 
. between the two countries, with 
more than one million soldiers 
deployed along the disputed border 
of Kashmir.
Both countries tested underground 
, nuclear devices in 1998 and say they 
have nuclear weapons in their arse
nals.
But it isnt known how many either 
-.country possesses or whether they 
, have the nuclear warheads to attach 
: to their missiles.
India is trying to go into an arms 
,,race, said Pakistan Information 
Minister Nisar Memon.
- . But India said that the testing of its 
domestically built Akash missile was 
routine.
 i We are testing different parame
ters of the missile since the past forti iiight, said Defense Ministry 
, spokesman P. K. Bandhopadhyaya.
. The missile is meant for air defense. 
d It will be used by the army and air 
force.
Pakistan said its test was successful 
_and insisted it was not intended to 
inflame tensions with India.
It has nothing to do with anything 
but to test the technical aspect of the 
missile, Pakistani Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said.
India earlier dismissed Pakistans 
test as a publicity stunt.
This particular test is clearly tar
geted at the forthcoming general 
elections in Pakistan, the Indian 
Foreign Ministry said in a statement 
released in New Delhi.
German-American 
relations mending
BERLIN (AP)  In a new sign that 
Germany and the United States are 
mending relations, Berlin on Friday 
welcomed a letter from President 
Bush that said relations were funda
mentally strong and stressed the two 
countries emotional bonds built dur
ing the Cold War.
The German government was 
pleased about this friendly gesture, 
said Bela Anda, a spokesman for 
Germanys chancellor Gerhard 
Schroeder.
Relations were soured when 
Schroeder announced his unbending 
opposition to a US invasion of Iraq 
and made it a central part of his suc
cessful re-election campaign last 
month.
White House anger peaked when 
Schroeders justice minister reported
ly compared Bush to Adolf Hitler, say
ing he was using war tactics to divert 
attention from problems at home. 
She is not being considered for the 
new Cabinet that Schroeder expects 
to present later this month.
But the two sides have since tried 
to smooth over the dispute. In the let
ter to President Johannes Rau, Bush 
said the millions of Americans who 
have lived and worked in Germany 
since World War II or were stationed 
here as soldiers constitute a bond 
that forms a strong basis for facing 
the new challenge ahead.
The letter was sent for Thursdays 
12th anniversary of German reunifi
cation. Bush recalled US support for 
the uniting of East and West 
Germany after the 1989 fall of the 
Berlin Wall.
Still, the differences remain. After 
talks with French President Jacques 
Chirac in Paris, Schroeder on 
Wednesday stood by his rejection of a 
war to oust Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein.
Schroeder and Bush have no 
immediate plans to meet before a 
NATO summit in November in Prague 
that both leaders are scheduled to 
attend, Anda said.
Also Friday, a senior German law
maker criticized the poker game 
between the United States and other 
UN Security Council members over a 
new resolution backing the return of 
weapons inspectors to Iraq.
Gernot Erler, a member of 
Schroeders Social Democrats, said 
the negotiations were creating an 
unnecessary delay.
The goal must be to gain make 
sure that Iraq is not developing dan
gerous weapons programs, he said 
on DeutschlandRadio.
Guilty plea ends 
shoe bomber case
BOSTON (AP)  Richard Reid 
pleaded guiltyFriday, laughing as he 
admitted he tried to blow up a transAtlantic flight with explosives hidden 
in his shoes. He also declared himself 
a follower of Osama bin Laden.
Basically I got on the plane with a 
bomb. Basically I tried to ignite it. 
Basically, yeah, I intended to damage 
the plane, Reid said in court, laugh
ing.
He said he did not recognize the 
American justice system but agreed 
that he committed the acts outlined 
in the indictment against him.
The 29-year-old British citizen was 
accused of trying to murder 197 pas
sengers and crew members aboard 
the American Airlines flight in 
December. He was subdued by pas
sengers after a flight attendant saw 
him trying to light a fuse sticking out 
of his sneakers, and the Paris-toMiami flight was diverted to Boston.
In court Friday, when US District 
Judge William Young asked him why 
he pleaded guilty, Reid replied: 
Because I know what Ive done.... At 
the end of the day I know that I done 
the actions.
Reid pleaded guilty to eight 
charges: attempted use of a weapon 
of mass destruction; attempted homi
cide; placing an explosive device on 
an aircraft; attempted murder; two 
counts of interference with flight 
crew and attendants; attempted 
destruction of an aircraft; and using a 
destructive device during a crime of 
violence.
A ninth charge, attempted wreck
ing of a mass transportation vehicle, 
a charge filed under the new USA 
Patriot Act, was tossed out by the 
judge in June.
Federal prosecutors told the judge 
they would recommend a sentence of 
60 years to life in prison, in accor
dance with federal guidelines. His 
sentencing was set for January 8.
As part of the plea, Reid had asked 
the judge to remove any mention of 
his alleged links to al Qaida from the 
indictment, but Young refused.
Lindh gets twenty 
years after plea
ALEXANDRIA (AP)  John Walker 
Lindh is ready to accept a 20-year 
prison term at his sentencing hearing 
today, a deal struck in return for his 
information on former Taliban col
leagues, Islamic extremists, and possi
ble al Qaida attacks after September 
11, 2001.
The government told US District 
Judge T.S. Ellis III last week that Lindh 
has fulfilled his agreement to cooper
ate, allowing prosecutors to drop more 
serious charges that could have 
brought a life sentence to the 
Californian who fought alongside the 
Taliban.
Lindh, 21, pleaded guilty last July to 
supplying services to the Taliban and 
carrying an explosive during commis
sion of a felony. Each count carries a 
10-year sentence.
Government officials said Lindh and 
other al Qaida and Taliban prisoners 
told US interrogators the September 
11 hijackings were supposed to be the 
first of three increasingly severe 
attacks against Americans. Their 
claims have not been corroborated, 
government officials said.
Lindhs lawyers have said his infor
mation did not come from high-rank
ing Taliban officials, but represented 
what he heard from fellow recruits at a 
training camp and, later, on the front 
lines in Afghanistan. The lawyers have 
said Lindh never swore loyalty to al 
Qaida or its leader, Osama bin Laden.
Details of Lindhs extensive interro
gation, part of his plea agreement, 
remain secret. But Rohan Gunaratna, 
a terrorism expert who worked with 
defense lawyers and interviewed 
Lindh, said the Californian told him he 
picked up battlefield rumors about 
post-September 11 attacks.

Organization lists 
anti-Israel schools
STANFORD (U-WIRE)  
Stanford University is among 18 
universities targeted for antiIsrael bias by a watchdog organi
zation that many in academia per
ceive as a threat to freedom of 
expression.
The stated goal of the new orga
nization, Campus Watch, is to 
improve Middle Eastern studies in 
North America by targeting antiIsrael and anti-American bias in 
academia.
Stanford students are getting a 
very poor interpretation of the 
Middle East, an extremist view
point that doesnt tolerate other 
viewpoints.... Stanford students 
should be concerned, said 
Campus Watch founder Daniel 
Pipes.
Since its inception this year, 
Campus Watch has been awash 
with controversy, as a large num
ber of students and professors 
oppose the organizations policy 
of naming and monitoring sus
pect universities, professors, and 
student activists.
Stanford Professor Joel Beinin, 
who was one of the professors 
Campus Watch originally posted a 
dossier on, said, This sort of 
McCarthy-style list-making and 
monitoring has no place in uni
versity life, as its purpose is to 
intimidate people from expressing 
their views and to set boundaries
on permissible speech.
The Campus Watch website states, 
American scholars, to varying 
degrees, reject the views of most 
Americans and the enduring policies 
of the US government about the 
Middle East.
Pipes said this problem was 
brought to the surface last year with 
the publication of Martin Kramers 
book, Ivory Towers on Sand ... 
[which] lays out the case that Middle 
East studies are seriously flawed.

Former prosecutor 
stabbed in stomach
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A former 
prosecutor was slashed in the chest 
and stabbed in the stomach Thursday 
while walking down the street  the 
second time he has been attacked in 
the past two and a half years, author
ities said.
Christopher Conrad, a former pros
ecutor for Allegheny County, was on 
his way to a morning appointment 
when he was attacked by two men, 
police said. Conrad, 53, told police 
the men rifled through his pockets 
and took out his wallet, but did not 
steal anything, said Pittsburgh police 
spokeswoman Tammy Ewin.
He told police one man hit him in 
the head, while the other slashed his 
chest and stabbed him in the stom
ach, Ewin said. Conrad was hospital
ized in good condition.
In May 2000, Conrad was attacked 
while stopped at a red light on one of 
Pittsburghs busiest streets. Police 
said a man walked up to his car, 
swore at him and asked for money, 
then attacked him with a six-inch 
knife.
Conrad told police he didnt recog
nize the assailant.
EPA and Pitt settle 
waste oversight
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  The 
Environmental Protection Agency 
and the University of Pittsburgh set
tled a dispute for $8,941 for the 
Universitys alleged violation of toxic 
substance regulations. But the basis 
of the dispute came down to a paper
work oversight, according to both the 
EPA and Pitt.
In six buildings throughout the 
University, chemicals called polychlo
rinated biphenyls are used to conduct 
electricity. PCB has been found to 
cause cancer as well as immune and 
reproductive system deficiencies in 
rats, and in 1979 its use was banned 
on transformers in buildings.
The violations were record-keep
ing in nature and were not related to 
improper handling or disposal of 
PCBs or other hazardous materials, 
University spokesman Ron Cichowicz 
wrote in a statement.
However, its not illegal to use PCB. 
If PCB was already present in a partic
ular building, there are strict regula
tions dealing with the use of the 
chemical.
First, it must be clearly labeled. 
Second, it must be checked routinely 
for leaks.
Third, it must be registered with 
the PCB transformer database by 
December 1998, which Pitt failed to 
do.
The enforcement action was based 
on record-keeping. The University 
just failed to register, said EPA 
inspector Scott Rice.
According to Cichowicz, the 
process for correcting the registration 
oversight had started prior to the EPA 
visit.
Bonnie Smith, a spokeswoman for 
the EPA, said the inspection did not 
come from a threat to human health.
If we were concerned with imme
diate danger to people we would have 
had an almost emergency response 
situation, Smith said.
NewsOddities
Prof researchs 
funniest joke
LONDON (AP)  Drum roll, 
please  an online search for the 
worlds funniest joke has produced 
a winner.
In a year-long experiment called 
LaughLab, a British psychology 
professor asked thousands of peo
ple around the world to rate the 
humor value of a list of jokes; they 
could also add their own favorites.
In December, Richard Wiseman 
and his associates announced the 
front-runner, a hoary old gag 
involving fictional detective 
Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick, 
Dr. Watson. But in the final tally of 
some 2 million votes for 40,000 
jokes, announced Thursday, a new 
joke emerged as a round-the-world 
rib-tickler:
A couple of New Jersey hunters 
are out in the woods when one of 
them falls to the ground. He does
nt seem to be breathing, his eyes 
are rolled back in his head.
The other guy whips out his cell 
phone and calls the emergency ser
vices. He gasps to the operator: My 
friend is dead! What can I do?  
The operator, in a calm sooth
ing voice says: Just take it easy. I 
can help. First, lets make sure hes 
dead. 
There is a silence, then a shot is 
heard. The guys voice comes back 
on the line. He says: OK, now 
what? 
Many of the jokes submitted 
received higher ratings from cer
tain groups of people, but this one
had real universal appeal, said 
Wiseman, who has published a 
book based on the experiment.
Man gets out of 
$4K library fine
ROCK HILL (AP)  Winthrop 
University officials say they wont 
charge a man the estimated 
$4,088 late fee for a book checked 
out of the schools library 56 years 
ago.
The book, 4zC .C, oB11g 
WBgrad9 ai oaerz tpdalBnpA has been 
missing from the shelves at 
Winthrop Universitys Dacus 
Library since 1946.
Alex McFadden returned the 
long-lost book Tuesday. He said he 
hoped the library would add it to 
its archival collection.
Books are very dear to me, 
said McFadden, of Rock Hill and 
president of the Valdosta Friends 
of the Library. I thought this was 
interesting to discover.
McFadden found the history 
book 14 years ago while cleaning 
his aunts house. It wasnt until he 
took it off the shelf three weeks 
ago that he realized it belonged to 
Winthrop.
The books checkout slip had 
two names: Martha Holroyd, who 
was the first to borrow the book, 
and Elizabeth Leslie. McFadden 
believes Leslie, a former teacher, 
lent the book to his aunt, Kate 
Williams Murphy, also a teacher.
Library officials said McFadden 
did the right thing by bringing the 
book back.

Quarters quarter 
mile raises money
The sisters of the Kappa Kappa 
Gamma sorority and brothers of 
Kappa Delta Rho fraternity collabo
rated for the second year in a row on 
Quarter Mile of Quarters, an event 
in which they celebrated the money 
acquired through the charitable 
donations of fellow Carnegie Mellon 
students over the past two weeks 
with a silvery chain of quarters.
The event took place on Friday, 
October 4, from 4:30 to 6:30 pm on 
the CFA lawn.
All proceeds of the benefit went to 
the Childrens Hospital Free Care 
Fund.
The fund benefits underprivileged 
children who cannot afford medical 
care, in keeping with the hospitals 
pledge to never deny aid to any 
incoming patient.
The event name refers to the path 
of quarters laid on the ground around 
the lawn  for the length of a quarter 
mile.
While the fund does not define 
exactly what donations are used for, 
Jim Lee, the philanthropy chair of 
Kappa Delta Rho said, Much of it 
goes to kids who cant afford surg
eries.
The day included much more than 
the circle of quarters that surrounded 
the lawn, however.
Snow cones, kettle corn, and pizza 
were just some of the treats provided 
for the people who made it out to the 
event.
Music was blasted by WKST 96.1, 
and the lawn was peppered with var
ious inflatable games.
The Carnegie Mellon Greek com
munity is different from a lot of 
schools, said Lee.
People not involved in it tend to 
underestimate the functions of the 
Greek life here. This event isnt just 
for other Greeks, its for the whole 
Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh com
munity.
Financing hinders 
Technology Center
Financing has not yet been settled 
for the Center for Technology 
Research and Development that is 
planned for the Junction Hollow, the 
area between Hamerschlag Hall and 
the Carnegie Museums.
The Center, a joint project 
between Carnegie Mellon and the 
Carnegie Institute, is slated to cost 
more than $30 million. The build
ings space will be leased to corpora
tions, in the hopes that high-tech or 
otherwise cutting edge companies 
will come to Pittsburgh and take 
advantage of the the proximity they 
would have to top-notch research 
universities.
One year ago, construction was 
expected to begin in the spring of 
2002, and by the end of spring, the 
start date was set for this past 
August. August came and went, and 
no construction work has taken 
place.
Theyre in flux, said University 
Architect Paul Tellers, in reference to 
the projects developer and 
financers. I dont think its any 
secret that we would have been 
under construction if all the financ
ing had been completed.
Last September, the University 
received a $6.2 million grant for the 
Center from Pennsylvania Governor 
Mark Schweiker.
Additionally, the Intel Corporation, 
which was under consideration for 
office space in the basement in the 
University Center in 2000, is one of 
the first companies that have shown 
interest in leasing space in the Center 
for Technology Research and 
Development.
In the meantime, final design 
review has been taking place on the 
Center, which will have four floors,
120,000 square feet of office space, 
and an underground parking garage.
Its going to be a very visible 
building to the public, not just to the 
campus, so there was a lot of care 
that went into reviewing the exterior 
appearance of the building, said 
Tellers.

Professor lectures 
on coffee farmers
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  The 
cost of producing a pound of coffee 
in Latin America is around 80 cents 
and that same coffee sells for about 
50 cents in the United States, a 
University Pittsburgh professor 
said at a roundtable discussion last 
week about the price of coffee and 
its effect on farmers.
Marla Rippol, a professor of 
Latin American studies, joined 
Brenda Smith of Building New 
Hope and John Notte, co-owner of 
La Prima Espresso Company, to 
educate students about the ongo
ing coffee crisis.
Rippol blamed the drop in prices 
on excess supply and a long chain 
of intermediaries between the pro
ducer and consumer.
Along with Brazil, Vietnam is 
one of the worlds leading produc
ers of coffee, growing and export
ing tons of it each year.
Rippol said Vietnamese farmers 
started growing coffee because it is 
relatively cheap to produce and 
easy to grow. Also, the government 
gives incentives to coffee farmers.
What is clear, though, is that 
the Vietnamese government has 
been giving farmers subsidies and 
credit for growing coffee, Rippol 
said.
John Notte looked at the coffee 
crisis from a businessmans per
spective. In business since 1994, La 
Prima experienced high prices dur
ing a Brazilian frost a couple of 
years ago. The current prices are 
the lowest since 1960.
Ill bet this year there are people 
on their knees praying for a frost in 
Brazil to keep the prices high, 
Notte said.
Notte explained that each cof
fee-producing country has an orga
nization that buys coffee from the 
farmers. The coffee is then shipped 
across the globe. The problem is, 
he said, that import, export and 
shipping costs are so high that little 
or no money ever reaches the farm
ers.
Notte got involved with helping 
farmers through Building New 
Hope, an organization that buys 
coffee directly from farmers, 
bypassing high shipping costs. 
Notte uses La Prima to roast and 
prepare the beans free of charge.
Building New Hope is currently 
involved in buying and selling coffee 
from El Porvenir, a small Nicaraguan 
cooperative community. Its goal is to 
provide people with quality coffee 
that ensures a fair price to coffee 
farmers. Building New Hopes 
Porvenir coffee is available in numer
ous locations around Pittsburgh.
Pitt still in top 345 
US universities
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  While 
the University of Pittsburgh is still one 
of the nations top 345 schools, 
according to a survey of more than
100,000 students conducted by The 
Princeton Review, the school contin
ues to be haunted by the old problems 
of race relations and red tape.
The survey, which was published in 
August as The Best 345 Colleges: the 
Smart Students Guide to Colleges, 
asked approximately 300 students 
from each school featured to respond 
to 70 questions about academics, 
campus life and the student body.
The schools are rated in various 
categories, profiled and ranked on 
issues ranging from Most Politically 
Active Students to Frat & Sorority 
Scene Biggest.
Pitt made two of these lists, ranking 
10th in Professors Suck All Life From 
Material and 14th in Little 
Race/Class Interaction.
Not every student surveyed agreed 
with the rankings, however. Students 
quoted in Pitts two-page profile said 
their professors are wonderfully 
entertaining and enlightening and 
lecture their balls off.
Surveyed students also praised the 
library and study abroad programs, 
but reported that students are 
cliquish, registration is a pain, and 
students must contend with lots of 
long lines and red tape.
Now in its 13th year, the survey was 
designed to provide the most inclu
sive snapshot of college life at the col
leges to students and their parents, 
editor Erik Olson said.
The colleges included in the first 
survey in 1992 were selected by con
sulting with college counselors, Olson 
said. Since then, editors have added 
schools with something to brag 
about, such as innovative programs 
or interesting curricular development 
to the list of schools covered.
In addition, they look for institu
tions that will add to the geographic 
and academic diversity of included 
schools. Colleges range from large 
research institutions such as Pitt to an 
all-male liberal arts college with 26- 
student enrollment.

CMU co-hosts security and 
competitiveness symposium
by Matt Rado
menBad orpii,dBrCd
This Tuesday and Wednesday, 
Carnegie Mellon will co-sponsor the 
National Symposium on 
Competitiveness and Security, orga
nized in conjunction with the 
Council on Competitiveness.
The Symposium will be another 
event jointly attended by CMU 
President Jared Cohon and 
Homeland Security Director Tom 
Ridge, who spoke at CMUs com
mencement last May and has 
worked with Cohon on the 
Homeland Security Advisory 
Council (HSAC).
The Council on Competitiveness 
was originally formed in 1986 as a 
response to a declining American 
market share in the international 
market.
According to the organization, its 
main goals are to set an action 
agenda that drives economic 
growth and raises the standard of 
living for all Americans.
Corporate, academic, and gov
ernment officials will attend in an 
effort to discuss how to mitigate 
security costs in the post-September 
11 environment.
Major speakers include Cohon, 
Ridge, and Merck CEO Raymond 
Gilmartin.
Chris Gabriel, vice provost of cor
porate partnerships and technology 
development, summarized the goal 
of the Symposium:
Isnt there a way to make our
selves safer without draining the 
bottom line?
Ever since the attacks of 9-11, 
many people have acknowledged 
the importance of industry-university-government cooperation to 
advance the nations effort to 
increase its security, Cohon stated 
in an email. This conference will be 
the first national meeting devoted to 
creating an agenda of cooperation, 
and Carnegie Mellon is proud to co
host it with the Council on 
Competitiveness.
Carnegie Mellons relevant exper
tise was one of the main reasons the 
University was chosen to co-host the 
event.
We have some of the best experts 
on how technology will affect soci
ety and the way people live, said 
Gabriel.
These strengths help Carnegie 
Mellon better understand the 
impacts that technology will have 
on everyday life, in addition to 
being able to develop new technolo
gy, said Gabriel.
Cohon is a member of the execu
tive committee of the council, and 
also has close ties with Ridge, whom 
he has worked with on the HSAC. 
The HSAC was formed in response 
to terrorist attacks on September 11 
last year.
Although the event is by invita
tion only, a webcast at ,,, fa1ICr(
BrBMCnCggA adu will be available, using 
new technology called ESM devel
oped by the School of Computer 
Science.
The symposium will begin 
Tuesday at 6 pm with a reception at 
the Duquesne Club and continue at 
the Omni William Penn Hotel in 
downtown Pittsburgh.
Mellon research center 
hush-hush on monkeys
MONKEYS, from page A1
According to a lab report by David 
McMahon, a graduate student in the 
department of neuroscience, 
researchers will sever the corpus 
callosum, an operation known as a 
callosotomy.
The corpus callosum is what con
nects the two hemispheres of the 
brain and allows them to communi
cate with each other. Based on 
oIlBrrBnu rzC We1pn SdpBn by Paul 
Pietsch, such operations aid 
research that benefits epileptic 
patients.
Both McClelland and Olson 
declined comment on these meth
ods of research.
While animal rights activists, such 
as Voices for Animal Liberation or 
Stop Animal Exploitation Now, both
My question to 
them is, if what 
youre doing is so 
great and wonder
ful for society, why 
wont you let people 
see it for them
selves.
Anne Lynch,
Voices for Animal Liberation
Pittsburgh groups, claim that 
CNBCs testing on monkeys is cruel, 
unnecessary, and will not save any 
human lives, some within the sci
ence community find it essential.
Thats part of a huge wave of 
research thats based on an under
standing of the neural mechanisms 
of the brain, and has begun to lead 
to major new kinds of therapy. I like 
to think were contributing to the 
basic understanding of the mecha
nisms that give rise to that, said 
McClelland.
According to Manavalan, who 
received her masters in information 
networking from CMU, CNBCs pri
mate studies also benefit research in 
brain mapping and therapies for 
healing stroke victims.
Manavalan said the experiments 
probably do harm the monkeys in 
some way, though they can still be 
used for other experiments.
But I dont know how many 
experiments you can recycle a mon
key for, she said.
In terms of the laboratorys 
hygiene, CNBCs record is immacu
late. Manavalan said that anyone 
admitted to the primate lab needs 
several vaccinations, including 
rabies and tuberculosis shots, before 
entering (both for the humans and 
the animals protection). 
McClelland said the monkeys were 
quarantined for months upon arriv
ing in the US, to avoid spreading any 
disease.
Animal facilities at Carnegie
Mellon are subject to frequent unan
nounced inspections by the [United 
States Department of Agriculture]. 
The Carnegie Mellon facilities have 
an excellent record with respect to 
USDA inspections. We welcome 
these visits by expert outsiders 
because they add an additional layer 
of oversight, ensuring that animal 
welfare is high, wrote Teresa Sokol 
Thomas, assistant vice president for 
media relations.
More than just legal issues drive 
laboratory hygiene as well.
The animals need to be essential
ly relaxed and comfortable in order 
for the research to proceed, anyway. 
Their welfare is as important to the 
effectiveness of the research as it is 
to our sense of humane treatment  
those things go hand in hand. We 
feel its crucial that they be treated 
well, said McClelland.
For the most part, CMU has not 
caught the attention of the animal 
rights groups, due to its adherence 
to federal guidelines and its relative
ly small number of non-human sub
jects.
According to Gault, the lab houses 
approximately 24 monkeys. This is 
very small compared to Pitt, which 
houses over 15,000 animals, includ
ing beagles and primates, according 
to Anne Lynch, a former Pitt student 
and member of Voices for Animal 
Liberation.
The main question that people 
seem to have about CMUs primate 
research is why it is kept so private.
The researchers are very secre
tive about their research, and take 
extreme measures to make sure no 
one else who is unauthorized gets to 
them. My question to them is, if 
what youre doing is so great and 
wonderful for society, why won't 
you let people see it for themselves, 
or at least answer questions about 
it? wrote Lynch in an email.
Despite his belief in the value and 
integrity of the work done at CNBC, 
McClelland sympathizes with the 
animal rights activists to some 
extent.
This is something that is always 
discussed in our society and it has to 
be discussed in our society, because 
no question is ever completely 
closed. So I totally respect peoples 
asking questions about it. At the 
same time, I think its probably true 
that many of the people who are 
expressing the greatest concerns are 
not all that well informed about 
whats really going on, said 
McClelland.
In attempts to gather information 
on CNBC, The Tartan met with con
siderable reluctance from both fac
ulty and staff. Olson refused com
ment entirely.
Several student sources were will
ing to go on record with informa
tion, but later asked to be removed 
from the article.
While most of the scientists are 
proud of the work that goes on at 
CNBC, not everyone stands behind 
the primate research. Manavalan, 
despite her background in science, 
thinks that the testing is cruel.
Its wrong to assume that simply 
because monkeys do not have the 
right to say no, that we can just cat
egorically take yes from them.
Abby Lynn, first year design major and Jackie Brook, first year psychology major, smoke Marlboro Light cigarettes in Lynns 
Morewood Gardens E-tower dorm room.Smoke-free housing could grow
SMOKING, from pageAl
The trend follows from the fact 
that secondhand smoke is known to 
aggravate respiratory problems and 
physical ailments. There is also 
increasing evidence that constant 
exposure to secondhand smoke can 
contribute to lung cancer and car
diovascular disease.
Eighty-five percent of first-year 
students asked for nonsmoking 
dorms in their housing applications. 
These students sign an addendum 
agreeing not to smoke in their resi
dence.
With this information, housing 
tries to route students into their 
room of preference to avoid con
frontation later on, said Michael.
We dont want to kick out the 
smokers from their living spaces and 
create smoking ghettos; its not the 
desired outcome, said Michael.
Sometimes, of course, its not an 
issue.
My roommate last year smoked 
like there was no tomorrow. Im not 
a smoker and it didnt bother me at 
all. I never realized the smell; I guess 
I adjusted to it, said Nina Durai, a
junior psychology and English 
major.
Some smokers though may see 
the progression towards smoke-free 
living as an infringement on their 
rights.
It is a sensitive issue that can 
affect the whole campus. Now the 
question is whether to continue or 
back down and let it be. The goal of 
the committee is to improve resi
dents lives. Smoking affects those 
that dont smoke, but then again 
smoke-free creates trouble for those 
that do smoke. It is all about how far 
we can go to make people happy, 
said committee member and SDC 
president Ken Herman.
Most students say they will toler
ate smoking but to a certain degree 
of personal preference.
I have asthma, but I dont mind 
people who smoke, I just wont be 
around them too long, said Ranu 
Bhagavatula, a first-year CIT stu
dent.
The smoking in Boss [House] 
wasnt too bad but there were times 
when some people would get 
together in the lounge and smoke a 
whole bunch so that our whole floor
Einstein or Hargrove?
would be filled with smoke, said 
John Lindstrom, a sophomore in 
CFA. You could just avoid it by shut
ting your door. I didnt bother to 
change rooms because I could live 
with it.
Beyond just divvying up living 
space, the committee offers smoking 
cessation classes in conjunction with 
Health Services.
The program, called HI IQ (Happy 
I Quit), is one-on-one counseling 
conducted by smoking cessation 
specialists.
The program is based on the 
Transtheoretical Model of Behavior 
Change which emphasizes meeting 
smokers where they are in their 
quest for change while supporting 
and encouraging them to make their 
own plans, stated Nancy Schmidt, 
the student health advisor and com
mittee' member, in an email. 
Schmidt said a questionnaire helps 
to customize the program for indi
vidual students.
Approximately 25 students (of 
which 60 to 70 percent are graduate 
students) take advantage of the 
nicotine, replacement therapy and 
advising.

Government 
seeks campus 
food reform
by Tim Bowen
menBad orpii,dBrCd
Dining at CMU is caught in a catch 
22 says Brian Namey, student body 
president. High prices scare students 
away from the meal plan, but low 
meal plan participation inflates 
prices. In an effort to combat the 
troubles of Dining Services, student 
government will re-evaluate the role 
of student government and that of 
Student Dormitory Council (SDC) in 
addressing problems with dining.
SDC is currently responsible for 
articulating the interests of students 
to the dining services administrators. 
Recent changes to the student gov
ernments constitution have brought 
the SDC closer to student govern
ment thorough the creation of an 
executive committee which brings 
the leaders of government and SDC 
together once per month to discuss 
pertinent issues such as dining on 
campus. Namey also has plans to 
bring the Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA) to the table.
It will broaden the perspective, 
he said. Due to the scope of the din
ing issue and the inclusion of student 
government and GSA, the oversight 
of dining issues may broaden from 
the SDCs sole control. Complaints 
about the quality of food on campus 
are low, according to Namey, but stu
dents frequently express concern 
over the high price of campus food.
[The meal plan] is kind of a ripoff said Daniella Kraut, an undecid
ed H&SS freshman.
The lack of a cafeteria style allyou-can-eat dining option also trou
bles students.
I want lunch ladies to serve me 
mashed potatoes and collard 
greens, said Robert Behrman, a first
I want lunch 
ladies to serve me 
mashed potatoes 
and collard 
greens. 
Robert Behrman
year graduate student of engineering 
and public policy. Namey says SDC 
and student government are devel
oping solutions through the execu
tive committee.
We are discussing how best to 
solve the problems in dining. That 
includes everything from the price of 
food, to the meal plan, to hours of 
operation, to the quality of food, to 
the mechanism for making those 
changes, said Namey.
One solution being discussed is 
additional advertising which will 
attempt to bring more students onto 
the meal plan, alleviating the heavy 
cost of food on campus, said Namey. 
He said that students might be more 
encouraged to use the meal plan if 
they knew that they save 15 percent 
over non-users. Because dining costs 
are subsidized by unused dining 
blocks, having a broader student 
base lowers these costs. Other solu
tions are still in development.
We are in the brainstorming 
phase. We encourage the student 
body to give us ideas. We encourage 
them to be involved in improving 
dining on campus, said Namey, 
though he declined to elaborate on 
other plans for dining improvement.
Namey also expressed concern 
over the viability of an all-you-caneat venue, citing the failure of 
Highlander Caf as an example. 
Despite this, Namey believes that 
there should be some kind of all-youcan-eat option on a more frequent 
basis.
It is one of my goals to extend allyou-can-eat Schatz to more than one 
day per week, said Namey, who has 
been a long-time supporter of an allyou-can-eat venue.
Colleges grapple with federal anti-drug edicts
DRUGS, from page A1
for government financial assistance. 
A policy contrary to the anti-drug 
provision will not cost a lot for Yale, 
which has a $10.7 billion endow
ment.
Vice president of enrollment Bill 
Elliott thinks that Carnegie Mellon 
cannot afford to emulate Yales poli
cy. To date, no student at Yale and 
only one student at CMU have been 
denied federal aid since the anti-drug 
provision was enacted.
While CMU debates a definitive 
answer to Elliotts fiscal concerns, 
director of Enrollment Services Linda 
Anderson says that in the meantime, 
the school will make up the differ
ence in lost aid for students affected 
by the legislation.
We will compensate an equal 
amount until weve had time to
develop a University policy.
Anderson says the anti-drug provi
sion was not an issue until this year 
when a students funding was placed 
on hold because he had reported on 
his FAFSA a prior drug conviction. 
Through enrollment services, the stu
dent declined to comment.
A national contractor scans FAFSA 
forms and applications, checking the 
veracity of social security numbers 
and citizenship status. Applications 
are flagged if a student has answered 
yes to question 35 (drug convic
tion), or left it blank. Since there is no 
national criminal database, a no 
response will send the application 
through the system cleanly.
Anderson isnt particularly con
vinced of the provisions effective
ness. Who will know [if someone 
lies]? There is no centralized data
base.
Under federal law, the University 
reviews and processes all financial 
aid requests from applicants. To cal
culate a familys expected contribu
tion, enrollment checks the selfreported data against tax forms. The 
remaining cost of tuition is com
prised of institutional and federal 
aid.
But how far must CMU go to deter
mine the accuracy of the information 
reported on the form? Anderson says 
the school can use tax records to 
determine the familys contribution, 
but there is no way to ensure the 
accuracy of the rest of the form, 
namely question 35.
The federal government has once 
again given us the task to ask a ques
tion to get information, and were not 
required to verify the accuracy of the 
self-reported data, says Anderson.
The federal government does
require schools to resolve conflicting 
documentation. But Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy says 
that is too nebulous a phrase. If 
Campus Police cited a student for 
smoking marijuana in his or her dorm 
room, Enrollment Services would 
never know.
That will certainly be part of the 
discussion. Our position has been 
that it is the responsibility of the indi
vidual to report that, said Murphy. 
He gave no timetable for the creation 
of a new policy.
Falsifying FAFSA answers is pun
ishable by a $20,000 fine or up to one 
year in jail. Murphy says CMU has 
never contacted federal authorities 
about an applicant lying on the 
FAFSA.

Police accused of abusing protestors

University president Jared Cohon sits with Provost Mark Kamlet during Fridays open house of the Doherty lab facilities.
DOHERTY, from page Al
the fall of 2000. Construction crews 
worked for two years after that to 
complete the project. Stump was 
regarded by the other speakers to 
have spent the most hours working 
on the project.
We were constantly struggling 
with how students really work in the 
lab versus how do we try and con
strain them to work in the lab with 
the facilities that we built and how do 
we design a facilities that will aid in 
the implementation of curriculum
and not hinder it or put obstacles in 
any way, she said.
Thomas Murphy P.E., who worked 
with Facilities Management Services 
to develop the structure for the build
ing, explained many of the problems 
of the construction crews. During the 
first digging phase to place the foot
ers to support the structure, they 
found the original plans for Doherty 
Hall had misrepresented how deep its 
footers were. Crews ended up dig
ging nine feet below Dohertys foot
ers. The old structural steel of 
Doherty was brittle and hard to work
with. Building on Carnegie Mellons 
hilly landscape was a difficult task, as 
well.
Its been a real joy to work with 
the chem folks and the FMS people, 
said John Taormino, a senior project 
manager from PJ Dick-Trumbull, the 
construction company involved in the 
actual building of the new facilities. 
But the work is not over yet. ^
While the experimental physics lab 
is able to accommodate students for 
classes, the other labs will hot be 
open until next fall because much of 
the equipment must still be ordered.
Insomnia is a common and 
frustrating problem. And it's

Were concerned when the police dont obey the 
Fourth Amendment of the Constitution ... rounding peo
ple up in droves, who are doing nothing more than 
standing in a park and protesting. Thats wrong, said 
Mulhauser. Patterson also added her thoughts concern
ing gross violations of the Bill of Rights.
I also have concerns that this weekends de facto mil
itarization of the District may have the effect of inhibit
ing the First Amendment rights of residents and of 
demonstrators traveling to the nations capital, wrote 
Patterson. However, the Metropolitan Police 
Department believes otherwise.
We dont lock up people for being out demonstrat
ing, said Kelly McMurry, a spokesperson for the
Washington, D.C. Police Department. Police officers in 
this city and across the United States are supposed to 
protect everyones First Amendment right. We only lock 
up people who break the law. When you break the law, 
then you get locked up.
The demonstration for the most part was non-violent; 
however, according to a police news release, police 
caught four protesters in possession of dangerous 
weapons. Officers found coffee cans containing either 
explosive ordnance, such as blasting caps, or spike balls 
consisting of nails epoxied together. The suspects also 
were in possession of smoke bombs, stated the news 
release from the Washington police.
The IMF is an international organization, mainly con
trolled by the United States, Japan, Germany, France, 
and the United Kingdom, that distributes loans to 
nations that are economically struggling.

THE TARTAN7 October 2002
Housing, Health Services make 
idle threats with shot program
Health Services can vaccinate students by 
appointment and have organized a clinic for 
all students on October 8. However, Health 
Services charges $85 per student for the 
shot  $20 more than the fee charged by 
the Allegheny County Health Department. 
Although the state law does not stipulate 
that colleges and universities must finance 
vaccinations, at the very least, Health 
Services should offer the shot at a cost com
parable to that found at other Pittsburgh 
health clinics.
The most questionable part of the 
Universitys vaccination campaign is the 
threat to use academic penalties for an issue 
pertaining solely to student health and 
housing. Few will argue that the University 
should violate state law and allow non-vaccinated or non-exempt students to remain 
in campus housing. However, the joint col
laboration between Health, Housing, and 
Enrollment Services to remove non-compliant students from classes is neither statemandated nor fair.
Threats to effectively withdraw uncoop
erative students from Carnegie Mellon have 
only been directed at residents of campus 
housing. Students living in non-University 
owned housing will apparently be permit
ted to remain in their classes regardless of 
their vaccination status  hardly an effec
tive health policy if the University is indeed 
as serious about the immunization cam
paign as it claims.
Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania 
is currently conducting a vaccination cam
paign of its own, yet has stated that noncompliant students academic status will 
not be jeopardized until the start of the 
spring semester. If Carnegie Mellon truly 
wishes to invoke academic penalties for vio
lation of the new meningitis vaccination 
law, then it should follow suit and allow 
more time for students both on and off cam
pus to either be vaccinated or request an 
exemption before withdrawing them from 
classes.
With the June 28, 2002 passage of a 
meningitis immunization bill, Pennsylvania 
became the 14th state in the nation to enact 
a vaccination law specifically targeting col
lege students. The law took effect on August 
30 and required Pennsylvania colleges and 
universities to notify students, who are six 
times as likely to contract the saliva-borne 
disease than others in the 18-25 age group, 
that they must either get vaccinated for the 
upcoming fall semester or sign an exemp
tion waiver due to medical or religious 
objections.
Approximately two weeks before the start 
of the fall semester, Carnegie Mellon stu
dents received a letter explaining the new 
legislature and requesting that they sign 
and return a form to the University stating 
their vaccination status and indicating if 
they wished to be granted an exemption.
On September 18, Housing Services 
emailed a vaccination reminder to residents 
and included the stipulation that if students 
fail to complete the required form by 
October 15, they will be removed from both 
campus housing and classes. A follow-up 
email sent to students on October 3 from 
Health Services pushed the compliance 
date back to October 17 and threatened that 
if students do not fill out the form, Housing 
will lock you out and/or you will be with
drawn from classes by John Papinchak in 
enrollment services.
While a University-wide push to comply 
with state law and vaccinate students 
against a rare but deadly disease is com
mendable, the method by which Health and 
Housing Services have carried out their 
campaign is disorganized and problematic.
First, CMU students should have been 
informed of the new vaccination require
ment shortly after the passage of the law. 
By waiting until the last weeks of summer to

Fraternity stereotyped negatively
Editor,
After reading your articles of September 16 (Police disperse 
Girls Gone Will at DTD house, v. 97, i. 3) and September 30 
(DTD will not bse charter, may face fines, v. 97, i. 5), I was disap
pointed to see Ciat The Tartan has fallen to the depths of nodding 
along with socid and cultural biases regarding fraternities with lit
tle objectivity o reflection. Fraternities have an image in our cul
ture. Unfortunaely, that image is far from sparkling. It is the 
responsibility of ournalists to provide an unbiased view of facts, not 
an interpretatioi. Sadly, The Tartan has failed in this charge.
I am a brothe at Delta Tau Delta, and in light of the ongoing 
investigation, In not going to comment on the alleged Girls Gone 
Wild event. It isstrange, though, that an event that warranted only 
a minor disordeiy conduct citation from the officers at the scene, 
apparently is irieresting enough to provoke two decidedly one
sided front pagearticles smearing our fraternity and the brothers 
thereof as not mich more than leering alcoholics. Particularly oner
ous were two quotes, the first from Martin White of the CMU police 
and one from Kathy Saye. Ms. Saye was not at the alleged event and 
has no basis for her presumptions, and Detective Whites quote is 
totally irrelevant, while presuming our house to be committing a 
crime. The level of professionalism, or lack thereof, in the CMU 
Police Departments discussion of an ongoing investigation is anoth
er question entirely.
If Greek organizations were anything like the image portrayed in 
your paper, they would not exist. There are many upsides to Greek 
organizations that you might not know about from reading the two 
sensationalist articles in The Tartan. For example, this past semes
ter, DTD had the highest QPA on the fraternity quad. We exceeded 
the CMU All-Mens average. This past weekend we had a Guys 
Gone Wild Philanthropy Event, raising over $300 for McKees 
Womens Hospital in just over 4 hours. Theres more where that 
came from. Fraternities deserve attention, but there is no reason 
why it all needs to be negative. I would expect more integrity and 
professionalism from of The Tartan staff.
DC police tactics at IMF protest 
disregard constitutional rights
Jack Shapiro
Junior, Ethics, History, and Public Policy
Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George 
Washington University, offered several 
alleged police actions that he believes 
should be scrutinized in the aftermath of 
the protests. He proposed that the D.C. 
Council  the legislative branch of the 
District government  should investigate 
whether police:
Prevented crowds from dispersing by 
closing off exit points as a prelude to arrest.
Kept people in shackles for more than 24 
hours.
Used excessive force when people tried to 
disperse through police lines or in the 
course of the mass arrests.
Held hundreds under pretense of admin
istrative delays in order to deplete protests.
Some activists raised their hands in signs 
of peace on September 27. Others raised 
their hands in violence. But regardless of 
individual intentions, all were treated as 
common criminals during the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank protests 
in Washington DC.
Accordingtp^rpolice news release, 5,350 
police w^aeployed to handle 2,000 pro
testors nd activists on the first day of the 
IMF/World Bank conference. Due to the 
violent nature of protests at the World 
Trade Organization meeting in Seattle three 
years ago, combined with ongoing concerns 
of national security, a large and well-pre
pared police force was certainly under
standable. Police were reasonably prepared 
for the worst, without knowing the inten
tions or number of demonstrators. 
However, after a relatively small number of 
protesters arrived on Friday and engaged in 
predominantly peaceful activities, there is 
no excuse for the resulting violent and 
legally careless behavior of the police.
During the course of the day, protesters, 
reporters, and onlookers were corralled 
into Freedom Plaza and Pershing Park and 
ordered to disperse, yet were prohibited 
from doing so by police barricades. Police 
eventually arrested 649 protesters, among 
them 21 CMU students, mostly for minor 
offenses such as failure to obey. Excessive 
force was reportedly used during some 
arrests, with several protestors hog-tied 
with plastic cords in holding cells.
Many of those arrested were not immedi
ately informed of their charges, yet were 
forced to wait on buses  some for up to 17 
hours  to be processed by officers. Others 
languished in jails or gymnasiums for over 
30 hours waiting to be read the charges 
against them and given the opportunity to 
offer a plea and post bail.

West Nile viru. Kidnapped children. 1-75 shutdown in Florida

piciously. Genetially-altered crops. Percholorethylene bans pro
posed in Californa. Thats quite a bit of potentially dangerous stuff 
Ive listed. But wiats dangerous and what should we do, if any
thing, about then?
This issue hit h<me when I received an email from a reader taking 
issue with my oppsition in my last column to MADDs push to lower 
DUI limits to .08 3lood Alcohol Concentration (BAC). The reader 
provided a real ex mple of a person with a .09 getting out of respon
sibility because .1 is the state legal limit.
I proposed a scnario in which the limit was .08 and the driver 
had a BAC of .07. iy point was that we can always be safer, but is 
it worth it? The r ader answered with a resounding YES, some
thing indicative oithe safety mantra we see today.
The fact is that i great many problems are hyped by the media, 
government, and ieoples own fears and insecurities. In a rush to 
feel safe and thin: of the children, we flitter from one safety issue 
to the next, not ta'ing the time to really ask two fundamental ques
tions. First, is thre a disproportionate or increasing danger? 
Second, is spendiig a lot of time, money, and effort really worth it 
or are we ignoringgreater dangers?
Consider again ne BAC issue. According to the National Highway 
Safety Transportaton Boards data from 2000,40 percent of all traf
fic fatalities involvd alcohol of any amount. However, 31 percent of 
all fatalities invoted BAC levels of .10 or more. Only nine percent 
involved BACs oi .01 to .09. Data from 1998 from the Texas 
Department of Pullic Safety showed that in that state, 83 percent of 
all administered tsts resulted in a BAC of .10 or higher, and the 
average was .16.
In short, the significant problem comes not from people blow
ing a .08 or .09, bt from people who are 60 percent above the limit 
for being legally dunk. Lowering the limit to .08 will simply make 
more legally drunlpeople instead of reducing the number of grossEven in times of high security, the 
American people cannot allow law enforce
ment agents to curb gatherings through the 
profiling of student activists and issuing of 
blanket orders. The behavior of police dur
ing the IMF/World Bank protests was not 
the result of decisions by individual offi
cers, but a concerted effort on the part of 
the police administration to thwart the 
legal rights of citizens to peacefully express 
their beliefs.
With the potential onset of a war with 
Iraq, allegedly on the behalf of the rights 
and safety of the world, it is now even more 
important that the rights of individuals be 
upheld in our own country. Protesters who 
gathered in Washington, D.C. on Friday 
were stripped of their rights. Not only did 
they lose their First Amendment rights to 
gather and speak, but they were also, in 
many cases, illegally arrested and detained. 
Police protocol was unacceptable and 
should be investigated to ensure that future 
peaceful protests are handled with dignity, 
care, and most importantly, with the US 
Constitution in mind.

THE TARTAN  OCTOBER 7, 2002
New bill risks 
abortion rights
THE TARTAN
Carnegie Mellon's Student Newspaper Since 1906went to Washington, D.C. to protest the crimes Western corporations 
commit against the third world, one issue in a sea of hundreds. The 
purpose of our trip to Washington, D.C. was to voice to the World Bank 
and IMF that we are aware of their abuse of human beings, and we 
wont be passive. It was also to show the public that its okay to voice 
an opinion of opposition, especially in a country where its now con
sidered unpatriotic to question our nations structure and policy. We 
cannot allow phrases like If youre not with us, youre against us, to 
tell us that we should be silent in order to remain American. We can
not allow modifications to our Bill of Rights which would make it ille
gal to protest without a permit in a country with free speech, to keep 
us from having a voice. We went to Washington, D.C. in part to exer
cise our rights and to show the rest of the nation that they can do the 
same thing. But our demonstration was just one example of nonviolent 
action.
There was much diversity among Wednesdays panel members: 
there a was protester who was in Washington, D.C. for this years IMF 
meeting, an activist who studied protest theater in South Africa, our 
student body president who discussed the action he takes locally with
in the realm of Carnegie Mellon, and the co-presidents of Amnesty 
International. The most important part of the discussion was that all of 
these activists were connected; they came together to discuss the value 
of nonviolent action. Nonviolent action comes in many forms, encom
passing peaceful public demonstrations, community building, letter 
writing, petitioning, and boycotting. Most importantly, nonviolence is 
not passive. It is choosing not to harm the environment, animals, 
property, or other human beings, but stand up for ourselves nonethe
less. By standing up in such a manner, people open up room for dis
cussion, for communication, and for people to respectfully effect 
change.
The panel discussion made me feel connected to all humanitarian 
causes, and all forms through which people are choosing to no longer 
be passive. However, the most important part of my experience in 
Washington, D.C., in conjunction with the panel discussion on 
Gandhis birthday, was that I have learned that it is my duty as a 
human being to attempt to bring about change where I see it as neces
sary. We must be the change which we wish to see, said Gandhi. If we 
walk around our world wishing that people no longer suffered and 
starved working in sweatshops across the globe, we must act. If we 
wish that workers in Carnegie Mellon were treated better, were paid 
living wage and given benefits so that they can support their families, 
then we must act.
The panel discussion ended on an uplifting note. Although each

On September 25, the House of 
Representatives passed the Abortion NonDiscriminatory Act in a vote of 229 to 189, which 
will directly affect state Medicaid, Title X, and 
even private insurance companies if passed. The 
name of the bill is extremely misleading, as there 
is nothing non-discriminatory about it. Rather, it 
is an attack on womens health care. Under the 
guise of conscience clauses, it allows any health 
care organization, from HMOs to hospitals, to 
refuse to provide abortion services, abortion
Nonviolent protest
As was reported in last weeks issue of The Tartan, 21 CMU students 
were arrested with another 639 protesters at the protests against the 
World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. It 
was a tremendous learning experience for all of us who were there, not 
only because of what we learned about ourselves and about the way 
the system in which we live works, but about nonviolent protest, as 
well.
A panel discussion was held on campus last Wednesday to com
memorate Mahatma Gandhis birthday. Mark Egerman, a senior who 
was arrested and beaten at the protest, explained on the panel that 
before the weekend of our demonstration, nonviolence was a tactic 
and a philosophy. Now, after experiencing nonviolence firsthand, it is 
much more of a tangible thing to him. By practicing nonviolence, it 
becomes more than a theory, but also a way of life, a method of expres
sion, and a vehicle to bring about change.
No one better embodied the spirit of nonviolence than Gandhi. 
Although nonviolent tactics had been used for ages, Gandhis leader
ship was truly the first, and probably the last, of its kind. Gandhi lived 
his life with two ideals: nonviolence and the desire for truth. He saw 
that every piece of property came from natural resources, and there
fore, violence against any property is violence against nature. This 
view of the way in which the natural world and ones existence are 
connected extends to his views of the human community. The human 
community is one community, always connected, and its members 
depend on one another.
Gandhi witnessed many injustices within the human community. He 
saw some prospering at the expense of others, and he saw those 
greedy for hunger .neglecting the basic human rights of others. 
Gandhis lifes work depended on his ability to channel his anger into 
bringing about positive change. Today there are just as many crimes 
against humanity occurring in the world. My fellow students and I
Under the new law, clinics 
could refuse to give women 
any abortion services informa 
tion and still receive federal 
funds.

Robert Cobb, Christina Dinwoodie, 
Gregory Prichard, Bob Rost, Ed Ryaninformation, or even contraceptives to women. 
The bills supporters have claimed that it merely 
clarifies existing law, but it actually alters current 
health care laws in dangerous ways.
Consider Title X health care, for instance. 
Created in 1970 as part of the Public Health 
Service Act, it provides funding for services for 
the young and those with low income, regardless 
of any inability to pay. At the present time, Title X 
provides gynecological care, screening for breast 
and cervical cancer, and contraceptive services. 
Should women request it, they are given abortion 
referral services, because clinics do not qualify for 
Title X funds if they do not provide full informa
tion. Under the new law, clinics could refuse to 
give women any abortion information and still 
receive federal funds.
Medicaid users would also be victims of this 
bill. The Hyde Amendment to Medicaid requires 
that abortion in cases of rape, incest, or when the 
pregnancy endangers a mothers life be paid for 
by the state. Under the new law, the Hyde 
Amendment is viewed as discriminatory, and 
could be ignored. The new law would permit a 
hospital or state-sponsored clinic to refuse abor
tion to a hemorrhaging 12-year-old girl who had 
been raped and impregnated by her father.
Since federal laws overturn state laws, this 
would also result in states being unable to change 
their Medicaid requirements regarding abortion. 
They would also be unable to require public or 
licensed clinics to offer services or information. 
Some states presently require that private insurance companies cover emergency contraceptives 
or limited abortion, but this bill could make them 
unable to do that.
Should the Senate pass the bill, it will land on 
the desk of George W. Bush, whose stance against 
abortion is well-known: that abortion should only 
be legal in cases of rape, incest, or when the 
mothers life is in danger. Vice President Dick 
Cheney, who has behind-the-scenes power, draws 
an even harder line  he believes that abortion 
should not be legal in any situation.
Whether or not a person supports abortion is a 
moral belief, and, therefore, should be a personal 
one. Cheneys anti-abortion beliefs are his own, 
and are not intrinsically harmful to anyone else. 
However, this bill would allow doctors to force 
their moral beliefs on their patients, something 
that should be prevented.
Analogously, some of the more fanatical mem
bers of religious sects such as Jehovahs 
Witnesses and the Church of Scientology believe 
that blood transfusions are immoral, and that 
instead the person should pray for God to heal 
them. Their moral belief is not harmful, but 
should a member of that religion be a doctor and 
refuse to give a patient a blood transfusion due to 
this belief, despite the feelings of the patient, that 
is simply wrong.
According to a poll taken by Gallup in 1998, 56 
percent of Americans oppose abortion in most 
cases, though only 17 percent oppose it absolute
ly. These constant efforts to chip away at Roe v. 
Wade, though, are not an answer for the majority 
who wish to severely restrict abortion services.

Its that time of year again: time to break 
out the evergreen branches, colorful lights, 
red ribbons, festive wrapping paper, and car
oling books! Or is it time to choose between 
trick-or-treating as Martha Stewart or a flesheating ghoul? The stacks of pumpkins that 
appeared at the supermarket about a week 
ago indicate that Halloween is the next big 
holiday. According to Hallmark, though, its 
already time to gear up for Christmas, in the 
most personal and intimate way possible, 
with the companys annual Ornament Debut 
last weekend.
For the hardcore ornament buff, though, 
the Debut is not the beginning. This year the 
holiday season roller coaster ride began on 
July 13, when Hallmark held its Ornament 
Premiere. For those who cant go for six 
months without gazing upon images of 
sleighs and reindeer, presents, gingerbread 
cookies, Santa, and toy trains, this was as 
good as it gets.
This years Ornament Debut promises to 
be bigger and better than ever before. Bigger, 
because a total of 90 new Keepsake 
Ornaments will be unveiled, just in time for 
the start of your holiday gift giving and home 
decorating, announced Hallmarks website. 
And better, because there is no better way to 
deck the halls or share your love of Keepsake 
Ornaments than with our brand-new 
Designer Collections. College students, take 
note of this: if you want your loved ones at 
home to know that you remember and care 
about them, be sure to take advantage of this 
exciting offer.
If left up to themselves, people would be 
sure to blunder in telling their loved ones how 
important they are. Even more pressing an 
issue is that without companies like Hallmark, 
the Russell Stover candy company, and the 
Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Americans 
would not commemorate the holiday season 
appropriately.

Originally, the point behind a card was to let 
people know that you remember them. The 
card could give the recipient a laugh, a warmand-fuzzy feeling, or something to be indig
nant about, depending on what type of mes
sage the card contained. Generally, the point 
of giving a gift is not only to show the recipi
ent you care, but to give them something to 
enjoy and/or find useful. When so many peo
ple are worried about gaining weight and 
staying healthy, chocolate isnt really the best 
gift choice. Yet its now a tradition to partake 
of chocolatey and sugary goodness at 
Christmas and Easter, and of course 
Halloween, too.
' Hallmark cards are great, twelve long
stemmed red roses are pretty, and chocolate is 
a gift from the gods. Ultimately, though, com
panies selling these products dont have to 
have the last say in how you celebrate the next 
holiday. If you know your boyfriend or girl
friend has a desperate longing for a grill, feel 
free to buy one and make this holiday their 
special day. Theyll be grateful, even if you 
dont share your love of Keepsake Ornaments 
with them.
intended for Christmas, birthdays, and 
anniversaries, come with a Bear-Gram and 
gourmet caramels, as a creative alternative 
to sending flowers. At least theyre branching 
out on what gifts are available. When you 
cant think of what to say to express your feel
ings or what to buy a friend or family member, 
the Vermont Teddy Bear Company is there 
with an easy solution.
How many times have you felt guilty over 
not having bought a Valentines Day card for 
that certain someone? Were you aware that 
by overlooking that vital purchase, you unwit
tingly revealed your well-hidden feelings of 
apathy towards that person? Everyone knows 
that its proper conduct to give a Valentine 
card on Valentines Day, if not flowers and 
chocolates as well. The more you give, the 
more you care, as long as its the right stuff. 
No one gives grills for Valentines Day, for 
example, because thats not whats appropri
ate for that holiday, or at least not yet. 
Eventually Hallmark will surely announce its 
new line of Valentines Day grills and snow 
blowers.
Not only are consumers limited by what 
gifts and commemorative tokens are appro
priate to exchange on these special days, but 
the restrictions distract them from the entire 
purpose of choosing a gift or giving a card.

Injury Updates: Last week, the Tartans held try
outs for a replacement field goal kicker. 
Sophomore Laird Stabler has won the job and will 
be the kicker for the rest of the season, pending 
junior starter Mike Palmers unlikely return from a 
torn quad in his kicking foot. Senior Sebastian 
Smelkos shoulder is severely separated, meaning 
he can no longer pass the ball well. As a result, he 
will play wide receiver for the rest of the season, 
where he played last year until taking over for 
then-senior Eric Zimpfer, who also went down 
with a shoulder injury.
Leading rushers: CMUs 320 yards rushing 
against Franklin and Marshall was their secondhighest this season, the highest total was their 332 
yards in the season opener against the Bethany 
Bison. Senior fullback Adam Urbanczyk and junior 
halfback Ricardo Clarke have accounted for 734 of 
Carnegie Mellons 1,072 total rushing yards this 
season. Urbanczyks role has changed dramatical
ly since last year when he averaged only 31.4 yards 
a game and 1.7 TDs a game. After starting fullback 
Jeffrey Stolper graduated, Urbanczyk no longer is 
just a short yardage back. This year he is averaging 
77.2 yards a game, but only one TD.
Defensive improvement: The Tartan defenses 
five sacks were a season high, doubling their sea
son total. Their previous high was three against 
Grove City College. The defense gave up just 20 
yards rushing to the Diplomats, a season low. 
Their previous low was 36 yards versus Bethany.
Other notes: The Tartans committed a season 
high nine penalties for 72 yards, while the 
Diplomats were penalized 10 times for 84 yards. 
The Tartans previous season high was five penal
ties for 45 yards against Randolph-Macon. 
Franklin and Marshalls Justin Salton caught eight 
balls for 157 yards receiving, by far the highest the 
Tartans have allowed to an individual this season.

As both teams settled into their 
usual styles of play, the shots start
ed, and the keepers were up to the 
task. Senior Tartan goalkeeper 
Maya Nigrosh made several impres
sive saves including one from 
Chicago forward Cherish Orozco off 
of a free kick.

keeper Andrea Przybysz saved sev
eral key Tartan shots to hold onto

ers Anne Talarico and Merry 
McConnochie that threaded 
between three Maroon defenders 
before being stopped by Pryzbysz.
A minute later, senior midfielder 
Melissa McMorrow pulled the ball 
out from the goalmouth, turned,
, and shot. The 30-yard oblique shot 
j passed over the keepers left shoulj ;der and into the net, giving the 
Tartans the only score of the half 
and a 1-0 lead.
[ . With four minutes to go in the 
j /irst half, Anderson fell again near 
| the sideline and re-injured her knee.
{ She was out for the remainder of the 
game, but will return to practices 
this week.
The half ended with more goal
keeper participation, including a 
play that pulled Nigrosh well out 
from the net to stop a Chicago 
breakaway.
The second half would not be as 
easy for the Tartan women.

90 seconds to play, but the ball was 
knocked away and the Tartans went 
to overtime for the second consecu
tive week. Neither team had many 
chances in overtime, though 
Chicago kept it a half-field game for 
the first five minutes. With four 
minutes left, Chicago midfielder 
Jacqui DeLeon was denied by 
Nigrosh. It was the last major 
chance for either team in the first 
overtime.
As the second overtime started, 
the momentum shifted back to 
Carnegie Mellon, who had the only 
two major chances in the 10-minute 
period. The first came when 
Przybysz caught a high ball while 
standing on the end line and the 
Tartans were awarded a corner kick. 
McMorrows kick was knocked 
away, and it was another six min
utes before another major opportu
nity materialized.
The last chance in the game for 
Carnegie Mellon came as the 
Chicago goalkeeper found herself 
pulled over 40 yards out from the 
net. First-year forward Hallie 
Dumont tried to net the rebound, 
but was unsuccessful. The game 
ended in a tie two minutes later.

games this season have ended with

huge opponents, she said.
continued to build upon an impressive season, col
lecting 98 yards and two touchdowns. Both of his 
scores came in the third quarter following sus
tained, deliberate drives by the Tartan offense that 
were absent in the first half.
Clarke, meanwhile, provided the capper with 
10:01 left in the fourth quarter when he scored on 
a two-yard scamper that finished off a 74-yard 
CMU drive against the Diplomats. Clarke ended 
the day with 81 yards on the ground, 4.8 yards per 
carry, and a pair of spectacular runs that excited 
the crowd of over 2,000 Tartan fans who showed 
up for the contest.
Part of the success the Tartans enjoyed rushing 
the football Saturday can be credited to their offen
sive line, an oft-overlooked bunch that created 
holes all afternoon for Urbanczyk and Clarke.
Our offensive line played a ridiculous game. It 
was amazing how many holes opened up in the 
second half, said sophomore quarterback Jarrod 
Highberger. Senior tackle and team captain 
Brandon Foth, along with the rest of his fellow line
men, allowed only one sack on the day.
Highberger himself played impressively as the 
! Tartans signal caller in his first start of the season. 
He replaced Robb Finkey last week in the loss 
against Johns Hopkins, showing glimmers of bril
liance and aplomb uncharacteristic for an under
classman.
Saturdays game was Highbergers to lose, as 
Finkey was suspended for one game stemming 
from his shoving match with offensive coordinator 
and running backs coach Richard Erdelyi one week 
ago. Highberger completed six of 15 passes for 94 
yards, including a 25-yard toss to Clarke over the 
middle.
On the defensive side of the ball, the Tartans 
enjoyed arguably their best game of the season. 
CMU caused two fumbles (recovering one), inter
cepted one of F&M quarterback Dave Maksons 32 
attempted passes, and recorded five sacks on the 
Diplomat QB.
I cant say enough good things about our 
defense. They just rose to the occasion. To shut out 
a team of Franklin and Marshalls caliber offensive
ly, I think it says a lot about our defense, said 
Lackner.
Leading the way for the cardinal and gray was 
senior nose guard Brian Smalley. Smalley, who is 
consistently double-teamed by opposing linemen, 
picked up two of CMUs five sacks for a total of 16 
negative yards. Smalley was joined by junior tack
le Phil Clingman and junior outside linebacker 
Brandon Weber, who contributed two and one 
sacks, respectively.
The Tartans have a bye next week, and then 
move on to the meat of their schedule with four out 
of five games against UAA opponents. Lackner, 
who stressed support for his coaching staff in the 
wake of last weeks onand off-field messiness, was 
glad to go into the off week delivering a win for the 
Carnegie Mellon homecoming crowd.
Dont forget: every year theres a homecoming 
game; its a homecoming game for me too, said 
the 1979 graduate. It was really uplifting.

after the non-goal.
Following a number of Chicago 
chances in the last 10 minutes, the 
score remained at 1-1 and the game 
proceeded to overtime. The 10- 
minute overtime was uneventful, 
with Chicago maintaining posses
sion for much of it. The Maroons 
also had many more chances than 
the Tartans, but both teams failed to 
score in the period.
Entering the second overtime, the 
balance shifted, with Carnegie 
Mellon gaining momentum and 
keeping the ball on Chicagos half of 
the field. The period would still 
remain close and not until the last 
minute did play accelerate giving 
the Tartans some final hope.
With one minute to play Chung 
launched a shot which was saved, 
barely, by Prochaska. As the second 
overtime came to a close, the 
Maroons and most of the Carnegie 
Mellon squad resigned themselves 
to the draw.
With five seconds left, I thought 
damn we tied,  said head coach 
Nick Gaudioso 
Carnegie Mellon had one last 
chance. The combination started 
with 18 seconds left on the Tartan 
half of the field and ended with 
Chung netting a rebound of Steidels 
shot  legally  from a yard out 
with only two seconds to play to win 
the game.
Somewhere in the excitement, the 
games final two seconds were lost, 
and the game ended with the 
Tartans remaining undefeated and
untied this season.
The next game is Tuesday against 
University of PittsburghGreensburg. With a game so soon 
and the team still suffering from 
injuries earlier this season, the team 
is unsure how they will fare against 
the 11-0 Bobcats.
Were still hobbling, said 
Gaudioso. Hibshman is just crawl
ing. James Chung isnt near his top 
speed ... we got two or three players 
who all they do is rest the day before 
the game, said Gaudioso.
With both teams undefeated com
ing into the regional match, 
Gaudioso knows that Greensburg 
will prepare hard.
This is a big game for them, so we 
have to be careful about that... more 
than anything we just have to be 
ready for the weekend, he said.

games? I wont go back on my pick 
of Oakland to take the series but Art 
Howes managing strategy hasnt 
filled me with confidence. I guess its 
a moot point, though, since the 
game will have been played by the 
time anyone reads this.
That just leaves the most uninter
esting of the first-round series, 
where the Braves will probably have 
finished off the Giants on Sunday. 
Like the Yankees, the Giants used a 
strong showing in game one to fool 
everyone into thinking they could 
keep it close. As expected, though, 
the Braves are better in every catego
ry. Through the first three games of 
the series, Atlanta increased their 
offensive output with every outing, 
while the Giants run production was 
in a constant decline.
San Francisco couldnt have much
confidence left after their game 
three beating, either. Not only did 
Atlanta break the game open with 
five runs on two pitches in the sixth 
inning, but just to show who was in 
charge, they tacked on four more 
insurance tallies in the ninth. To top 
it all off, Barry Bonds two solo 
homers (accounting for both of his 
RBIs) werent exactly striking fear 
into Atlantas collective heart.
The Braves have been so impres
sive thus far that I may even have to 
reconsider my previous views on the 
upcoming Atlanta-St. Louis NLCS 
match-up that only a complete melt
down by the Braves would avoid.
The Braves offense has been much 
more potent than I expected, though 
their production has come at the 
expense of a Giants pitching staff 
worse than that of the other teams.
The Cardinals are riding high after 
knocking off the defending champs, 
but have to be careful not to let a 
sense of complacency set in. By tak
ing out the Johnson-Schilling duo,
St. Louis should feel good about 
their offense capabilities. Thats a 
good thing, since the Braves have 
had one of the most consistent staffs 
all year long, even if their individual 
numbers havent been as flashy as 
those on many of the other teams.
The Cardinals game two win 
shows that they have the focus to 
win close games as well, which the 
Braves havent had to deal with yet.
Atlanta appears to have stepped 
up their play since the regular sea
son, but, again, thats also a factor of 
thier poor opposition. St. Louis has 
also risen to the occasion, and with 
the power they feature up and down 
their entire lineup, the Cardinals are 
ready to relegate the Braves to 
another winter of heartbreak in 
somewhere around six games.

Urlacher and Lewis lead the pack of NFL linebackers
Fegha iegged.p
It has only been four weeks and 
Im already confused. I see the Rams 
at 0-4, and Im confused. I see the 
Chargers at 4-0, and Im confused. I 
see the Steelers, well, I see the city of 
Pittsburgh, and I get confused. The 
point is, Im lost, Im as confused as 
most of you probably were yesterday 
morning when you woke up in a dif
ferent place then where you started 
your homecoming celebrations.
Football used to be so easy. So 
black and white, offense kept you in 
it, but defense wins championships. 
Even last year this was the case. But 
now?
Defense has gone the way of the 
buffalo. Its kicked the bucket; its 
crossed the Jordan. Granted, there 
are some impressive units out there, 
but even the best defenses can get 
scored on.
It is an offensive game; the glam
our rests on the quarterbacks and 
receivers, the running backs and the 
tight ends. It is sickening. But there is 
redemption in sight. I have had an 
awakening, a vision, what alcoholics 
call a moment of clarity. I have decid
ed that, despite the offensive heyday 
we are witnessing, we have the good
fortune of seeing some of the best 
linebackers to ever play the game.
From Keith Brooking in Atlanta to 
Junior Seau in San Diego, the league 
is filled with superstar linebackers. 
But despite the league-wide talent, 
there are two that stand above the 
rest, Brian Urlacher and Ray Lewis. 
The past few years these two have 
emerged as the two toughest men in 
football, they are the two brightest 
torches keeping the defensive fire 
burning. They both dominate the 
line of scrimmage, and have made it 
nearly impossible for opponents to 
run on them. Two years ago Ray 
Lewiss top-ranked defense didnt 
allow a one hundred-yard rusher all 
season and Urlacher is in on nearly 
every tackle.
Watching them is stunning. It is 
like going to the frat house and 
watching a girl half my size drink 
twice as fast as me. It is like ordering 
something from CMU Dining 
Services and enjoying it. It is like ask
ing upperclassmen if they like it here 
and them saying yes. It is unbeliev
able.
Despite their apparently equal tal
ent levels, every football fan has his 
opinion as to who is better, myself 
included. Brian Urlacher is a tough 
man. He is very fast, very strong, and
plays the game with an intensity that 
scares the hell out of me, and Im sit
ting on my couch watching. He can 
hurdle blocks and pursue the ball 
better than anyone. Numbers-wise I 
bet Urlacher comes out on top. I 
imagine hell have more tackles and 
sacks than Lewis; already this season 
he has proven that he is better at 
making plays behind the line of 
scrimmage. But numbers dont 
always make the difference. Lewis is 
not a man, he is an animal. He will 
have more interceptions than 
Urlacher, he is better in coverage, 
and get close in tackles, but none of 
that is what causes me to vote him as 
the top defensive player in the 
league. He is intense, more so than 
anyone. He does his little dance 
before every game (a dance that Im 
perfecting for my next party); he 
fires up his defense. And his passion 
is evident in his performance. I 
cringe at every hit this guy makes.
Before Monday night I could still 
argue for Urlacher; he has been accu
mulating more sacks and tackles this 
season, and his defense is a much 
stronger unit that Lewiss. But that 
was before Monday night. Now Im 
convinced that Lewis is the best line
backer in the NFL. In addition to the 
18 tackles, and the one interception,
Lewis single-handedly took over the 
game. I could go on about how 
intense he was, but it could be 
summed up in one play. After Jason 
Elam tanked a 57-yard field goal 
with no time left in the first half, and 
Chris McAlister began to run the ball 
back the other way, Denver coverage 
man Keith Burns got a taste of the 
carnage that is Ray Lewis. Burns 
rushed down the field to make the 
tackle and was blindsided by the 
beast. It was a hit that you feel sitting 
on your chair at home. Im sure 
someone, somewhere, spilled their 
beer. Lewis came out of no where 
and leveled Burns, providing the key 
block to spring McAlister for a touch
down, and proving to fans every
where that he is the best.
So there it is: my contribution to 
the great debate. Urlacher is a great 
linebacker, and may someday be bet
ter than Lewis, but until he has the 
Super Bowl MVP trophy, the Ring, or 
the reputation of leading what is 
arguably the best defense to ever 
take the field (2000 Ravens), he is 
not the best. Ray Lewis is, and will be 
for a long time.

defeated two players in straight 
sets before surrendering, 6-1, 6-0, 
to third-seeded Hagerman, a 
sophomore who plays for 
Washington and Lee University.
In doubles action, the eighthseeded team of Weng and senior 
Annie Bosler made it to the quar

rBaseball looks to 
Rochester games
The baseball club lost both its 
games in Sundays doubleheader 
against CCAC-Boyce, but the play
ers know they are good enough to 
compete with Boyce  they beat 
them just last Monday.
All the pieces didn't come 
together today, said senior captain 
Dan Bogard. But at the same time, 
we saw it come together when we 
beat this team. And were looking 
forward to get it together for this 
weekend.
The baseball club will pack into 
three rented vans this weekend and 
make the trip to Rochester, N.Y., to 
play a mini-tournament. On 
Sunday, the team will play 
Rochesters varsity team in what 
will be CMUs first ever game 
against a UAA opponent  a big 
step in its quest for varsity status.  
The anticipation has been build<- 
ing since the beginning of the sea
son, and Bogard is confident thfc 
team will play well.
Weve been looking forward to 
this weekend for three or four 
weeks now, said Bogard. Were 
excited.

7 October 2002 THE TARTAN PageAl4
Tartan men win 2-1 in double overtime
by rfp) PCmmtlmCg
orpii,dBrCd
Intent on keeping its undefeated, untied season 
intact, the mens soccer team did not show it for 
the first 110 minutes of this weeks game. But at 
the end of two overtime sessions, the Tartans 
came away with a 2-1 win Sunday over the 
University of Chicago (6-3-0) and improved their 
record to 7-0-0 (2-0-0 in the UAA) this season.
While the game started off with few shots and 
many hits, it was not long before Chicago became 
irked with the Tartans physical play. Twelve min
utes into the first half, the Carnegie Mellon 
defense leveled a Chicago player. But less than one 
minute later, Chicago forward Barret Van Sicklen 
placed a ball into the top of the far corner of the 
goal behind sophomore goalkeeper David 
Thomas.
This marked the first time all season the team
had fallen behind in a game, after 5 shutouts and 
last Sundays 3-1 win against Washington. The 
half continued with the Tartans making several 
bad passing decisions and several more Maroon 
near-misses, including one where the shot passed 
inches outside of the untended left side of the 
goal.
Coming out of halftime with the score 1-0 in 
favor of Chicago, the team got to work almost 
immediately. Chicago was awarded a free kick two 
minutes into the half. Thomas made a punch save 
sending the ball downfield where a foul gave 
Carnegie Mellon a similar shot, but the Tartans 
kick ended up in the hands of Chicago goalkeeper 
Micah Prochaska.
Twenty-four minutes into the second half, 
Chicago midfielder Reed Fleetwood was injured in 
a collision. After he was replaced, the Tartans 
were given possession. A shot by senior Adam 
Hibshman was knocked past the goal by the 
Maroon defense, giving the Tartans a corner kick.
Sophomore defenseman Alex Beck hit the ball to 
the corner of the goal, where it ricocheted off a 
Chicago defenseman back to Beck, whose second 
attempt found its way to the back of the net tying 
the score at 1-1.
It took us a while to get our game together 
today, said assistant coach Lou Campero, com
menting on the lateness of the Tartans initial 
score.
Physical play but no scoring finished out the 
half, including Chicago defenseman Matt 
Wiecherts tripping of Carnegie Mellons leading 
scorer James Steidel. Steidel responded to this two 
minutes later with a high shot that was barely 
blocked by Chicagos goalkeeper.
Two minutes after that, senior forward James 
Chung netted a ball, but the team was not credited 
with the goal due to an offside penalty. Chung was 
subsequently issued a yellow card for excessive

Women lose intensity in 
second half, tie Chicago
by rfp) PCmmtlmCg
orpii,dBrCd
After starting their season with an 
eight game win streak, the womens 
soccer team tied a conference oppo
nent for the second consecutive 
game, a good result considering that 
their UAA schedule pitted them 
against their two most difficult rivals 
in the first two conference games. 
They tied the University of Chicago 
1-1 on Sunday to bring their record 
to 8-0-2 (0-0-2 in the UAA).
The Tartans pressed in the first half 
and were able to take a one-goal lead 
by halftime, but Chicago picked it up
in the second half and eventually 
evened out game, and it stayed that 
way.
I felt we really dominated in the 
first half and [Chicago] dominated in 
the second, said head coach Heather 
Kendra.
Chicago, 7-1-1 after the game, 
started the first half with a number of 
mistakes, mainly turnovers, which 
allowed Carnegie Mellon to generate 
several scoring chances. To counter 
their unexpectedly poor first-half 
play, Chicago became increasingly 
physical, committing a number of 
fouls culminating in an injury to

A memorable 
October is in 
the making
y.tt Eoba
Pitching and defense are supposed 
to win championships, but we 
havent seen much of either in this 
years playoffs. In the 14 games 
played through Saturday, there has 
been just one  the Cardinals 2-1 
win over Arizona in game two - in 
which neither team scored five runs. 
Five runs were also the fewest scored 
by a single team in any game 
between the Yankees and Angels, 
who averaged a combined 14 runs 
per game. The Braves-Giants and 
Athletics-Twins match-ups are also 
generating at least 11 runs per game.
All this shows is that it takes a 
well-rounded team to win it all. 
Arizonas run last year was the 
exception spurred on by two of the 
best pitchers in the game getting hot 
at the same time. Attempting to 
repeat the formula this year, the 
Diamondbacks went three and out 
against a more solid all-around St. 
Louis team. Sure, you dont expect 
Randy Johnson to give up six runs in 
six innings in game one, but the 
offense only scored two, anyway. 
Following up that strong showing 
was the 2-1 loss, giving Curt 
Schilling no run support through his 
seven strong innings. The 
Diamondbacks did manage to ramp 
it up a bit in game three, but a whop
ping three runs wasnt nearly enough 
to hold off a St. Louis sweep.
The other series which finished 
before Sunday was the as-good-asadvertised Angels-Yankees shootout. 
After coming from behind with four 
runs in the eighth inning of game 
one, it looked like the usual Yankees 
October magic was in full force, but 
it was not to be. The Yankees reliev
ers were about the only part of the 
team to live up to expectations, but 
since none of the starters gave up 
less than four runs, the bullpen had 
to face the added pressure of keep
ing the score close rather than clos
ing out a win.
Offensively, the Yankees werent 
that bad, but they just couldnt keep 
up with the way the Angels battered 
their pitching staff. All due credit 
goes to Anaheim, however, for not 
packing it in after that tough game 
one loss. This team is for real, and 
will pose a serious threat to 
whomever they face in the ALCS.
Fun fact about the Angels: Troy 
Glauss three home runs in the series 
made him the teams career leader in 
post-season round-trippers.
As for the Angels next opponent, 
whether that turned out to be 
Oakland or Minnesota, the Twins 
showed a lot more than I was expect
ing with a strong win at Oakland in 
game one. I dont give the Twins too 
much credit for their game four rout 
because the As sealed their fate 
when they decided to start Tim 
Hudson on three days rest. As a 
quick refresher: this NEVER works. 
Okay, so Jarrod Washburn did go 
five strong to finish off the Yankees 
in game four after pitching seven 
innings in game one, but I guarantee 
that he would have imploded in one 
more inning. He threw 94 pitches in 
his five innings of work, and wasnt 
nearly as sharp as his two earned 
runs allowed suggests. Washburn got 
double plays to get out of tight spots 
in the first and fourth innings, and 
Raul Mondesi and Juan Rivera both 
hit long drives into the stands just 
outside the foul pole. If either had 
stayed fair, the whole complextion of 
the game could have changed.
Next up for Oakland was Mark 
Mulder, also going on three days 
rest (for the first time in his career, 
no less). The As would have to go to 
a four-man rotation in the later 
rounds anyway, so why not let your 
number four guy go once in the midSee PLAYOFFS, page A13
Tartans triumph 
over Franklin & 
Marshall, 21-0
Rowers tops among local schools at Head of the Ohio
by Lpot Dpe$n$m,,n
orpii,dBrCd
There was a moment in the third quarter 
of Saturdays homecoming game against the 
Diplomats of Franklin and Marshall where 
the skies opened up, sunshine poured forth, 
and dark, brooding clouds gave way to the 
light of what felt like a new and beautiful 
day. The same could be said for the Carnegie 
Mellon football team.
The Tartans endured 30 minutes of sloppy, 
lackadaisical play only to emerge in the sec
ond half invigorated and spry, sending F&M 
to its second straight loss of the season while 
improving their own record to 3-2. Despite 
having matched last seasons loss total five 
games into this years schedule, the CMU 
coaching staff looked at Saturdays win at 
Gesling Stadium as a confidence-builder, and 
they remain optimistic about the upcoming 
University Athletic Association schedule.
Its a big plus that were up right now, 
said defensive coordinator and linebackers 
coach Terry Bodnar. [The Tartans] get used 
to winning here and then expect to win.
Head coach Rich Lackner echoed his assis
tant coachs sentiments. Its certainly some
thing to build upon, he said. It was really 
good to see that our kids didnt dwell on 
[missed opportunities in the first half]; that 
they fought through it. I really respect our 
team for fighting through that and coming 
through with some big scores.
Those big scores came by way of the 
Carnegie Mellon rushing attack, again led by 
the junior halfback Ricardo Clarke and 
senior fullback Adam Urbanczyk. Urbanczyk

People lined up along the 
Allegheny River Saturday morning, 
from the Three Rivers Rowing Club 
at the 31st Street Bridge to PNC Park 
downtown, to watch the Head of the 
Ohio Regatta, in which the Carnegie 
Mellon University Rowing Club team 
medalled in four events and finished 
tenth overall in the points standings 
out of 122 organizations. The CMU 
crew team placed ahead of both the 
University of Pittsburgh and 
Duquesne University.
Teams from Boston University, the 
University of Maryland, Miami 
University, Michigan State, and 
Notre Dame showed up to row in the 
Head of the Ohio.
For the races, which started at the 
rowing club, teams from the 
Pittsburgh area launched their boats 
from the clubs boathouse. Teams 
visiting from other regions set up 
shop on the riverbanks next to PNC 
Park and had to row to the boathouse 
for the start of each race.
Carnegie Mellon entered a total of 
thirteen boats, contending in a vari
ety of events.
All in all, I felt that we had as 
strong a showing as weve had in a 
long time, said head coach Donald 
Webber-Plank. This was our first 
major regatta of the season, and the 
team displayed a lot of depth. This is 
as large a team weve ever fielded.
The highlight of the day came 
when Carnegie Mellon finished third 
out of twenty teams in the mens club 
8+ event with a time of 14:44.4, just 
three-tenths of a second behind MIT, 
one of the stronger teams to com
pete. This was the first time a mens 
heavyweight 8+ team has medalled
in a regatta of this size.
Weve been rowing together for a 
while, but it hasnt been until recent
ly that weve been starting to race as 
one unified boat, said junior Jason 
Smoker, who was the 4-seat for the 
team. If you pull together and race 
as a single, cohesive boat, thats 
when things really start happening.
Carnegie Mellon also medalled in 
the mens lightweight 8 + , mens
lightweight 4+, and masters 4+ 
events, finishing third in each.
While the women rowers did not 
medal, they too made strong show
ings and finished in the top ten in 
two events. The club 4+ boat fin
ished eighth out of thirty-two teams, 
and the lightweight 4+ boat finished 
sixth out of fifteen, despite missing 
their stroke, junior Vanessa Gerber, 
who injured her wrist rowing in the
womens noontime sprints earlier in 
the day. Gerber looks to return later 
this week.
It was not the best showing weve 
ever had, but we had a solid show
ing, just no medals, said senior Lilly 
Bigelow, the womens team captain. 
We know we can do more and we 
will strive for that in the coming 
year.

lugged home this midsemester break is haunting, 
or if the Alfredo sauce from the lap of the dress 
worn to the Greek formal last week needs to be 
ousted, students have undoubtedly realized that it 
is necessary to wash clothes.
Carnegie Mellon, demonstrating its firm sup
port of hygiene, provides several adequate laun
dry rooms to students living on campus and in 
University-owned apartments. Dorms are 
equipped with a number of washing machines 
proportional to their residents (about one for 50 
students) and an equivalent or slightly higher 
number of dryers (to account for the extra time it 
takes to dry clothing and for those who leave their 
laundry inside machines for hours at a time). 
Some laundry rooms contain machines that oper
ate with quarters and cost $.75 to operate, while 
the remaining take laundry tokens that can be 
bought at Entropy or from the desk attendants in 
the dorms. In the Oakland community apart
ments, the machines tend to be pricier, and the 
prices vary from building to building.
For those new to the art of laundry, or too 
embarrassed to ask for help, the school offers sev
eral options. Certain dorms addressed residents' 
concerns by offering a laundry information ses
sion, led by RAs. Carnegie Mellon retail services 
also released a list of suggestions and guidelines 
regarding the well-being of students clothes and 
their machines. The list teaches how to gauge the 
size of a normal load and advises against adding 
extra soap to clean extra-dirty clothes.
If the pitfalls of dorm laundry are too much to 
overcome, or if you live off campus, a surprisingly 
convenient solution awaits. An on-campus clean
er's and laundry service is located on Margaret 
Morrison Street below the sorority houses. The 
complex, open 24 hours a day, is home to 16 wash
ers and 16 dryers, more than anywhere else on 
campus, and is accessible to anyone who possess
es a CMU ID.
Aside from the appeal of the large number of 
machines (resulting in a shorter wait than in most 
residence halls), the extra charm of the Margaret 
Morrison laundry complex may not be inherently 
obvious. As a convenient and possibly cheaper 
alternative to dry cleaning services located far
ther away, the staff will gladly dry clean gar
ments. Be certain to bring in soiled attire a few 
days before it needs to be worn again, because the 
staff is only available on weekdays from 8 am to 
4:30 pm. The approximate turnaround for this 
service is about two days.
The average university student may not often 
find themselves in need of dry cleaners, but can 
still benefit greatly from the staff at laundry serv
ices. For those who have little precious time to 
concern themselves with folding their own under
wear, or were absent when their RAs lectured 
about the science of measuring detergent and sep
arating lights from darks, the laundry service will 
ensure that clothing is sorted by color, washed 
and dried, and even folded by the end of classes. 
The service is offered at $.80 per pound (a repre
sentative was not available to estimate how heavy 
a load normally is), but pickup and delivery are 
only offered to faculty and staff, as students are 
notoriously unreliable at being present for their 
deliveries.
While Carnegie Mellons laundry system 
remains inconsistent in price, machine size, and 
method of payment, the University makes a com
mendable effort to ensure that students have sev
eral options when it comes to keeping their whites 
white and their brights bright.

Homecoming commenced with the annual Carnegie Day exercises in 
the main gym. The crowning of freshman homecoming queen was the 
culmination of Fridays festivities. Classes were canceled from 11:30 am 
to 1:30 pm to allow all students to take part in the days events. 
Fraternity houses competed against each other with their exterior deco
rations and original homecoming cheers at the Friday pep rally. On 
Saturday, the Tartans defeated Case Western Reserve at Forbes Field 
(10-0). The highlight of the homecoming events was the semi-formal 
dance.

President Richard Cyert, along with three members of the CMU Board 
of Trustees, returned from a seven-day trip to Israel co-sponsored by the 
National Jewish Foundation and the Israeli government. In Israel the 
group met with several leaders of the country, including Menachem 
Begin, the Prime Minister of Israel, as well as Israeli government offi
cials. Cyert did not expect an easy or quick peace settlement, and said 
that the political situation in the Middle East was more complicated 
than Americans understood because of the deep conflict between Israel 
and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. During his trip he met with 
the presidents of local universities, discussing future student exchange 
programs with CMU.

The campus observed National Coming Out Day, established in 1987. 
The holiday was founded to encourage more gays and lesbians to be 
open about their sexual orientation. According to Duane Williams, a 
senior research programmer and a cmuOUT member, openness would 
prevent discrimination and intolerance and as a result, gays and lesbians 
would be treated better as a group. ALLIES and cmuOUT handed out rib
bons for people of all sexual orientations to wear and show their support 
of the gay community. The day included a rally at the Clock with various 
speakers.

Student Senate considered a plan to make the Graduate Student 
Assembly (GSA) a separate governing body with its own bylaws and 
financial resources. GSA proposed the plan, which had been voted down 
twice in the two prior semesters, pointing to inadequate graduate stu
dent representation. If passed, Student Senate would represent only 
undergraduates, but both branches would operate under one constitu
tion. Due to insufficient information given to the Senators, the propos
al was not voted on by the Senate.

Six CMU alumni were reported dead or missing as a result of the 
September 11 attacks. Fred Kuo, Jr. (E 69), and Norma Lang Steurle 
(HS, 69) were reported dead. Jonathan Uman (IM, 90), Lawrence Kim 
(HSS, 97), Alan Unton (IM, 97), and Matt Yarnell (HS, 97) were 
reported missing. A total of twenty-two CMU alumni worked in the 
World Trade Center and fifteen worked at the Pentagon. A memorial 
service was arranged to be held on Homecoming Weekend and also on 
October 13 in Kresge Theater. A tulip tree was to be planted adjacent to 
the tennis courts in memory of the victims. Jennifer Neubauer, assistant 
vice president for Alumni Relations said that these tragic deaths brought

TriDelt Sexual Assault presentation
Last Monday, Delta Delta Delta presented the ABCs of Sexual Assault with 
speakers from Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) in Rangos Ballroom.
Holly Opatick, an education specialist from PAAR, attended the meeting 
and was the nights keynote speaker. Like many sexual assault lectures, 
Opaticks agenda for ABC was primarily concerned with defining sexual 
assault, advising on strategies to reducing the risk of assault, and the possi
ble actions to take after an assault.
Drug-facilitated sexual assault most concerned Opatick. She is especially 
focused on rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, and Special K.
[Bar] bases around the nation have bartenders who are already paid off 
and [the drug] is in the tap, she warned.
TriDelts Public Relations representative Sue Yeh said the event was sup
posed to be small, intended mainly for the benefit of her fellow sisters and 
other Greeks, but was still open to the campus public. Yeh said that the lec
ture was meant to discuss matters concerning college women and to spread 
awareness of sexual assault statistics.
Senior Kristin Paluchak, a TriDelt sister, said Because Im a senior and 
weve had other talks, it was just good to hear [the lecture]. You dont always 
think about it all the time and people do some of the things she mentioned 
[like taking drugged drinks because] they dont think its going to happen to 
them.

Betances insists on remembering heritage
In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project hosted a lecture 
by Samuel Betances, diversity consultant, profes
sor of sociology at Northeastern University, and 
author of 4Cn orCIg ra rzC WCpy ai tlpgg Betances 
spoke to students and Carnegie Mellon staff last 
Friday on the importance of a multicultural edu
cation and the role of minorities in the future of 
America.
Betances, who was born in Harlem and raised 
in Puerto Rico, presented a vivid account of his 
upbringing and the hardships he faced once he 
moved back to the United States. As a child, 
Betances was told by his teachers to forget his 
Spanish and downplay his heritage.
One of the greatest tragedies in America is 
telling kids to forget what they know, he said.
Betancess spirited style of lecturing was dis
played throughout his speech as he switched 
from English to Spanish and from inner-city slang 
to a Southern drawl. He quoted famous political 
figures, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and John 
F. Kennedy, changing his voice accordingly to 
imitate them.
Throughout the lecture, Betances stressed the 
importance of developing an educational system 
open to people of all economic levels.
One of the greatest challenges in America is to 
provide a framework for students so they can 
learn in a middle-class place called a school, he 
stated.
He spoke at length about how demographic 
changes in America would require future genera
tions of Hispanics to be educated to play a promi
nent role in the future of the US. Betances urged 
minorities to feel proud of their heritage.
Dont ever be ashamed of the way your cul
ture is able to shape you, he said.
Betances concluded by reading the poem We 
Are One by University of Houston professor 
Cheryl Sawyer. The lecture was followed by a 
small reception.

Restaurant Review
Cabo Grill: big, filling, and flavorful
Part of the success of Mexicos food diaspora has also been 
its failing. It is good, quick to prepare, and the ingredients 
normally do not run high in price. Following this line to its 
exaggerated extreme we find places like Taco Bell, Chi Chis, 
Del Taco, et al. This is where perception comes into play. The 
cuisine has been such a hit since even its formative years here 
in the United States that it can be thought of as a beloved fix
ture. There is no more Mexican food :ep cuisine so much as 
there are ever-flowing options for the late-night munchies set. 
(To wit: "Mexican pizza", jalapeno poppers, and the deadly 
sounding "Choco-Taco".) Cabo Grill, a spunky upstart amidst 
the chock-a-block eateries and low-slung jean outlets of the 
Waterfront, will not completely change your opinion of 
Mexican food (there are other, more consciously sophisticat
ed Nuevo Latino places to do that) but you will walk away full 
and appreciative of an evenings stay from a number four, 
crunchy, with a large Mountain Dew.
Cabo occupies the space formerly known as the Capital City 
Diner, across from Loews Theatres. From the moment you 
enter the place, (which should be on a weekend) youll notice 
table after table dotted with birdbath-sized margaritas, heavy 
with salt, sporting a deep azure glow from an intemperate 
mixture of Curacao, tequila blends, and bunches of fruits. If 
cocktails dont interest you much or the prospect of gulping 
down a hogshead of Sauza is too daunting, by all means have
a fCdMCLp The beer list boasts a number of Mexican brews you 
may have never heard of and some you must surely have, such 
as Corona and Corona Light. Those lesser, non-alcoholic bev
erages are served in what appears to be distant cousins of 
mason jars, adding a nice, rustic touch.
On to the food. As stated before, Cabo will not have you 
swearing off bread for hand-rolled tortillas or compel you to 
rename that 89 Chevy Cavalier Rocinante anytime soon, but 
take heart in the fact that the portions will be big, filling and 
flavorful. Each table receives complimentary tortilla chips 
and the house salsa. The chips are what any of its kind should 
ideally be: crisp, airy, fried, and not in the least bit healthy. 
The salsa may irk some. It is slightly watered down and too 
similar to commercial varieties, lacking thickness and chunk. 
The hot sauce, two to a table, may serve as a welcome alter
native. The piquancy of the appetizers and entrees is never so 
overpowering that one doesnt taste the food at Cabo. For 
starters, try the roasted chicken quesadillas, served with a 
healthy dollop of sour cream and a salsa verde-like medley 
called pico de gallo. To get the most out of the dining experi
ence, order from one of four combination platters that yield 
enough in most places to feed two. (This reviewer, with nary 
a soul to share with, soldiered through his Border Grande of 
two cheese enchiladas, beef taco al carbon, chicken chalupa, 
and a tamale served with pico de gallo, Mexican rice and frijoles by his lonesome, a feeling not unlike winning a 26-mile 
marathon run barefoot.) Be sure to end your night at Cabo 
with the infectiously-popular fried ice cream. According to 
the manager Paul, the dessert has achieved cult status in the 
restaurants two week existence, and several nights have since 
passed when supply was unable to meet demand. So, in the 
unfortunate instance that you are forced to go without it, 
allow a piece of Cabos prodigious key lime pie to slake your 
appetite and cool down your taste buds.
veBCn fan lp CgICdpnLp MBMCA plCudC 1eCdCT is a Mexican say
ing that means, He who lives with hope dies happy. After 
eating at Cabo Mexican Grill at the Waterfront, you may feel 
a slight amendment is due  He who does not eat better 
Mexican food dies hungry.

Avoiding meat on campus and off
People make the decision to become vegetarian or vegan 
for many different reasons. However, those who attend 
CMU share one complaint  Pittsburgh is not a vegetari
an-friendly city! says Chikako Suzuki, a graduate student 
in the drama department.
A lot of restaurants, I feel, dont do a really good job of 
supplying vegan food, or even vegetarian, says Josh Space, 
a senior in design.
Trying to eat vegetarian on campus is even more limiting. 
I really only eat at the Indian place in the Old Student 
Center, and occasionally the tofu at S Seor, says a stu
dent who chose to remain anonymous.
But is Pittsburgh really such an inhospitable place to be if 
youre vegan or vegetarian? Not really, if you know where 
to go to eat.
Oakland
Oakland can be one big wild mock-goose chase for veg
ans and vegetarians. Its easy to find enough pizza and bar 
food to top off a landfill, but for all the nutritional value 
they offer, these offerings belong atop a mound of garbage, 
anyway!
Kiva Han Coffee, a coffeehouse on Craig Street, used to 
carry Curtis Foods products: packaged vegan pastas, bean 
dishes, and other healthful concoctions. Now that Curtis 
Foods has kicked the bucket, says Kiva Han owner John 
Mutchka, the coffee shop is about to start producing its 
own line of pre-packaged veggie cuisine, in the tradition of 
his catering company, Green Cuisine Inc.
Im hoping [to offer vegetarian food] by the end of the 
month, Mutchka said. Were trying to do something a lit
tle different, a little more socially conscious.
The real jewel in the crown of Oaklands veggie scene is 
its Indian cuisine. If youre jealous of your meat-eating 
friends ubiquitous opportunities to gorge on greasy halfprice Chinese lunch buffets, its time to extract veggie 
vengeance. Due to religious endorsement of vegetarianism, 
much of Indias ethnic food is vegan. And unless your 
Achilles heel is spices, there really is something for every
one.
Bombay Ramas lunchtime buffet ($6.50 to eat in, $5 to 
take out) makes sure to include at least three vegan dishes 
(sometimes more) and a vegetarian dish in its six-dish buf
fet, which also includes rice, bread, desserts, and salad bar. 
Owner Viji Jaitley says he tries to keep vegan and vegetar
ian customers needs in mind.
Vegans have to eat too, he says, smiling. India Garden 
on Atwood also has a lunchtime buffet, and their food is 
half-price from 4 to 6 pm and 11 pm to 1 am.
Middle-eastern restaurants such as Ali Baba on Craig 
Street and Baba-Ds on Forbes Avenue offer enough vegan
elements to make up whole meals. Protein-packed hum
mus, baba ganouj, sleek, vegetable soups, and salads, and 
hearty veggie-and-bean masterpieces blow traditional ice
berg confections out of the water.
For a Californian take on traditional deli fare, visit Craig 
Street Coffee, a small sandwich place with an enticing veg
etarian selection. But vegans have few options there, other 
than the lentil soup or vegan chili.
Fuel and Fuddle, on Oakland Avenue, is a yummy, inclu
sive place for vegetarians to munch on grilled and baked 
dinner specials with their meat-eating friends. But, again, 
vegans are left out in the cold, as the dough used in the 
pizza and breadsticks contains egg. Some items that seem 
to be vegan are often prepared with eggs and dairy.
Spice Island Teahouse on Atwood is popular with vege
tarians and vegans. Many of the vegetarian dishes at this 
funky, pan-Asian cafe are vegan.
Another veg-friendly pan-Asian option is Lulus Noodles 
on Craig Street. Its healthy assortment of vegetable dishes
 steamed, sauteed, or otherwise  is sure to please. A 
steamed veggie appetizer ($3.50) is a small, yet savory, 
meal in itself.
Around Town
Srees on Murray Avenue has a menu similar to his cam
pus truck. Milk and cheese lovers will find Milky Way, also 
on Murray Avenue, simply delightful; this kosher vegetari
an restaurant (which serves some fish) is a good place to 
try new ethnic salads and veggie dishes.
For a special night out, or just for an epicurean experi
ence, head to Zenith Tea Room on the South Side. Menus 
change from week to week in this quaint cafe that includes 
an antique shop, but the food is consistently creative. All of 
it is vegetarian and can be made vegan. Prices range from 
$10 entrees to $3 salads. Vegan desserts are an especially 
tasty boon.
For shopping and munching purposes, the East End Food 
Co-Op is an organic paradise. Its versatile selection of bulk 
beans, pastas, granolas, grains, dried fruit, herbs, and teas 
is complemented by its plentiful choice among packaged 
organic food and household goods, produce, and even 
meat and dairy products. Its wholesome cafe is ideal for a 
satisfying and cheap East End vegan meal.
Murray Ave Kosher carries lots of tofutti cheeses and has 
lots of kosher things that are also vegan, says Wendy 
Gable, a drama sophomore.
To get to Maggies Merchantile in the Laurel Highlands 
you will definitely need a car. You will also need Mapquest, 
a full tank of gas, and 75 minutes to drive there. And boy, is 
it worth it! Maggies is an entire restaurant of vegan fare, 
made by a local family and served Wednesday through 
Sunday. On Sunday mornings from 11 am to 3 pm, 
Maggies offers a huge buffet of ethnic cuisine  each 
month has a theme.
The University of Pittsburgh also hosts an excellent site, 
zrrI2__,,,IBrrCye_QpnB1plg_ueByC_MCupnzr1l with 
information about vegan-friendly dining in Pittsburgh.

jumble of artPanopticon: a chaotic
To anyone raised in Pittsburgh or even to anyone who has visited the 
Carnegie Museum of Art more than once, the notion of a new exhibit 
comprised entirely of the museums permanent collection displayed in a 
different way, may sound like the most boring thing.
To the contrary, Panopticon is a huge visual thrill, even for art-jaded 
eyes. If you start to suspect on the walk up to the gallery that perhaps some
thing new is going on  the base of the stairs is swathed in old-fashioned 
ornamental drapery  the moment you enter the galleries themselves, 
youll be convinced.
The museum has transformed its usual icy-white, modern-minimalist 
space into an inviting 19th century salon-style exhibition; the walls of 
Gallery One are now lavender-mauve, grand arches guide the eye across 
the panoply of art objects. American paintings in gilt frames pile on the 
walls from floor to ceiling, ranging in styles from the 1850s to today. The 
museums collection of designer chairs spiral whimsically up the grove of 
pillars in the center of the room. This is an overwhelming but delightful 
clutter of shape and color. Its easy to guess that a feat like this accom
plished with less skill would add up to something jumbled and ugly. But, 
no; the optic nerves rejoice at the effect of so much beauty crowded into 
such a finite space. This is a victory of curatorial finesse.
In Gallery Two, European and Asian paintings take over the fox-brown 
walls, but the five figurative sculpture displays grouped by theme are what 
steal the attention. The arrangement About Face collects together a 
dozen busts, masks, and heads, juxtaposing such wonders as the sad, ten
der face of a little girl (Sorrow, by Auguste Rodin) with the massive Yuan 
Dynasty Head of Guanyin, a 12th century Buddhist deity. Its easy to envy 
the small children sprawled on the floor, enjoying the art lessons offered by 
the Carnegie Museum. Theyre receiving a much more fantastic early intro
duction to culture than most do.
Finally, Gallery Three showcases the museums works on paper. This 
space is calmer than the two preceding it, but nonetheless impressive in its 
array of fine drawings and prints. Since the works on paper are fragile, no 
part of the collection can stay up for long, so the selection of works here 
will continually change throughout the run of the exhibition, providing a 
good excuse to go back to Panopticon again and again.

Landscapes and still-lifes by a CMU alumnus
Using a bright and relaxing palette, Maxwell Connan created a peaceful set 
of landscape and still-life paintings for his exhibit at the UC gallery, which 
runs through October 12.
Connan graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with an engineering 
degree, but later found a passion for painting. But just how did an engineer
ing major switch to art?
I started painting 35 years ago and started taking workshops here and 
there, said Connan. Ive never taken any formal training.
If there is one theme underlying all of Connans work, it is most definitely 
one about being comfortable and relaxing. Looking at a big canvas titled 
Homage to Monet, the painting mesmerizes with its lavish blue color and its 
serene quality. With just a hint of darkness under the rocks, the 2D image sud
denly offers a very real perspective.
Connans repertoire includes a variety of topics, but it is still landscapes 
that dominate the exhibition. The landscapes are designed to emulate the 
skies of the Southwest and Santa Fe. The orange-purple backdrops capture 
the dusty mood of the southwest skies but Connan manages to add a touch of 
romanticism to it. Is there a central theme running through his works?
Connan said, I take different subjects. I enjoy them all, particularly stilllife. Its a labor of love.

TH6T6PHair succeeds with
One of the major attractions for this years Homecoming 
weekend was Scotch n Soda's production of WpBd
WpBdA conceived by Gerome Ragni and James Rado, tells the 
story of a young man named Claude (played by Jace Young) 
who spends his final days before going into the army sur
rounded by a tribe of hippies. The show loosely follows his 
tale with songs that discuss drugs, love, racism, and freedom.
Sophomore BHA (directing and creative writing) major 
Sola Fasehun chose and produced the show. This is her first 
musical (for which she only had four weeks to prepare), but 
she, remarkably, brings together all elements of production.
WpBd portrays the sixties as a controversial decade. When 
something major happens in life, said Fasehun, history has 
shown that theater has been the first to attack it or confront it 
or expose it. While I couldnt write a whole musical, like this, 
around it, what I wanted to do was do something that was 
similar.
The enthusiastic cast sings a wonderful rendition of Galt 
MacDermots melodic score. Though the acting was slow at 
times and the show began to drag, musical numbers, includmusic, not acting
ing Black Boys/White Boys and Good Morning Starshine, 
brought the audience back into the show. This is not to say 
that the acting took anything away from the show. In fact,
Jonathan Martofel/Junior Staffwriter
Brian Grays Berger and Alex Orgeras comedic personae, 
including Margaret Mead, are memorable. Gray had a solid 
acting performance, while Orgera displayed her remarkable 
singing talents. The entire cast, mostly composed of freshmen 
and sophomores, brings energy to the stage.
The cast members interacted and, at times, even had phys
ical contact with the audience. The tribe walked through the 
aisles, spoke with the front row, and at the end of the first act, 
Amanda Velazquez, a material science and English sopho
more, was lifted from her seat momentarily by a police offi
cer for seeing the show. Although it may been easier to per
form in the Chosky, the small stage in McConomy provided an 
intimate environment.
Tribe member Beth Semler, a sophomore architecture 
major, said, We had a month to put the whole thing togeth
er. To do that in this amount of time with these many songs is 
amazing. Everyone involved was dedicated to make this pro
duction a triumph, and they succeeded.

Trials and tribulations in the world of beauty pageants
Pillbox October 7, 2002
Blood. Sweat. Tears. Broken fingernails. Lost diaphragms. 
These were the trials and tribulations overcome in this years 
College of Fine Arts and School of Music crossover produc
tion. o1BlCA a Marvin Hamlisch musical, takes a humorous 
and somewhat controversial look into the not-so-beautiful 
side of beauty pageants in the 1980s.
The musical centered around four characters, each with 
their own ideas of what it takes to win a beauty pageant 
senior voice major Tara Besso (Robin Gibson) played the 
wholesomely nave debutante who felt that a woman didnt 
have to market her life in order to win the crown; senior voice 
major Jo Ellen Miller (Doria Hudson) portrayed a country girl 
who had been in her fair share of beauty pageants, but never 
won one that she could feel proud of; Pie Price (Brenda 
DiCarlo Freelander) was the ambitious pageant coordinator 
who would do anything to make her pageant a success, even 
if it meant abiding with the stigmatisms of pageants; and 
Henry ONeill. (Big Bob Freelander) portrayed Brendas virtu
ous husband, wanting to see each woman live out her dream 
of being beautiful.
Each year, the School of Music has two productions, one in 
the spring and one in the fall, one an opera and the other a 
crossover work. This fall, the production was a crossover, 
including aspects of musical theater such as acting and chore
ography.
Xo1BlC was selected because of the overabundance, shall 
we say, of soprano women in the senior class, said musical 
director of o1BlC and director of choral studies Robert Page. 
We try in the production to cast the seniors, first priority, 
then the juniors, sophomores, etc. This show has a role for 
every junior and senior voice major. I love the show because 
its perfect for the personalities of our ladies.
This turned out to be a pleasurable experience for the lis
teners, because the blending of the female chorus produced a 
rich and colorful sound that soared over the music of the fourpart orchestra pit and out into the audience.
The music for o1BlC was a two-piano score accompanied by 
bass and percussion. The arrangement, developed by Page, 
sophomore music major Kristin Juhasz, and junior music 
major William Nobel, added character to the already classic
80s beauty pageant 
aura of big hair, rosy 
cheeks, pleated skirts, 
and pantyhosed legs 
with its syncopated 
rhythms.
Even though most of 
the audience had prob
ably never experienced 
what its like to be in a 
real beauty pageant,
Millers rendition of 
Disneyland and 
Bessos Dear Mom 
gave inside views of 
what the typical debuBrad Yankiver/ Photo Staff
tante went through.
Each soloist had a style of their own, adding to the personali
ty of their character. Senior voice major Jason Kaminski as the 
host of the Young American Miss 1985 delivered an outstand
ing portrayal of the typical crooning style of pageant hosts.
There were some shaky parts in the production (a faulty 
light cue in the beginning and microphones randomly dying 
out), but the production was a success. It didnt possess the 
dramatic scenery and intricate choreography of a School of 
Drama production, but the sound of the voices and music 
compete with professional performances.
This is a wonderful class, said Page before the start 
o1BlCg first run. Classes are like apples and oranges. You 
cant compare them. They are what they were when they 
came in and they are what they are when they leave.

Much ado about a stock performance
The bizarre thing about the production of sefz 3ya 3$aer 
.arzBnu at the Pittsburgh Public Theater downtown is that its 
amazingly similar to the 1993 film version starring Kenneth 
Branagh as Benedick and Emma Thompson as Beatrice. Like 
the film, its set in an Italian villa in the 1860s, making the cos
tumes and atmosphere almost identical. One gets an eerie 
feeling that even the actors are in on the mimicry; their line 
deliveries and gestures match those of the characters in the 
movie.
This strange semblance isnt necessarily bad. The film was 
charming, and so likewise is the Public Theaters production. 
Its just slighdy puzzling. The universality of the themes in 
Shakespeares work make it easily adaptable to many settings. 
The 1860s Italian villa is pretty, and the current productions 
set well-captures an air of shabby grace, but the show could 
have been set in a fresher time and place for a more interest
ing effect. It can be suspected that director Ted Pappas made 
the proven popular choice not so much out of artistic impera
tive, but out of a need to meet the demands for comfort and 
familiarity from the publics graying subscription base.
The cast performed in a uniformly professional, polished 
manner, but sadly, the all-necessary spark failed to light 
between Deirdre Madigans Beatrice and Douglas Harmsens 
Benedick (one of the two primary couples in the play). 
Beatrice and Benedicks famed rivalry of barbs never makes it 
up to potential refined and ticklish heights; instead it collaps
es into forced hilarity when Harmsen starts making grotesque 
faces. This lack of real fun is more fatal to the show than it 
would be to an ordinary comedy, because wit isnt just an ele
ment of the play, its a theme. Characters in sefz 3ya 3$aer 
.arzBnu either suffer for an excess of wit (like Benedick and 
Beatrice, who use it to hide their own love from themselves)

or a lack of it (like the melancholy villain, Don John, who 
wouldnt be so evil if he didnt take himself so seriously).
However, the dramatic trio composed by Jarrod Frys 
Claudio, Stina Nielsens Hero, and Edward James Hylands 
Leonato are spectacular. Fry and Nielsen make a believably 
sincere and adoring young couple. In the wedding scene 
where Claudio mistakenly accuses Hero of whorish behavior, 
Fry successfully exerts his characters range of emotion, 
revealing bruised boyish love underneath the tide of overzealous accusation. Likewise, for the following scene where 
Leonato rebukes his daughter Hero, Hylands performance as 
a doting father catapulted close to madness by his humiliation
is wrenching. As Hero, Nielsen faces 
both men with a satisfying maidenly 
bewilderment and compassion for their 
upset.
If you choose not to see sefz 3ya 
3$aer .arzBnu at the Public Theater  
you might be better off renting the film 
because its sexier  at least stop into 
the OReilly to see their impressive Made 
for You exhibit of items designed specifi
cally for Public Theater shows over the 
years. This could be truly exciting for any 
theater design majors out there. The 
exhibit features many finely detailed cos
tumes and set pieces, like Ranevskayas 
dress and faux sable coat from 4zC 
tzCdd9 Ydfzpdy (1999-2000 season) 
designed by Mark Negin, and an entire 
formal Japanese room from 4Cp (2000- 
2001 season) designed by Michael 
Schweikardt. However, the most stunning pieces are the twin 
red dragons from sCyCp (2001-2002 season) designed by 
Allen Moyer and situated dead center in the OReillys lobby.

Last Pittsburgh performance of Sankai Juku dance
When world-renowned Japanese dance company Sankai Juku took the stage at the 
Benedum Center on October 5, hundreds of people saw something so beautiful it was breath
taking.
The swelling concert hall, usually swarming with stray flute notes and buzzing crowds at 8 
pm on a Saturday night, was suddenly filled to the brim with silence as the slowest of light 
cues illuminated what looked like giant contact lenses filled with water. The delicate sound of 
single water droplets falling began to reverberate in the space; then, a few bald men, naked 
from the waist up and painted white, slowly uncurled from tiny bundles on the stage and 
began to dance. Hundreds of people waited as these men continued to unfold; it was as slow 
as a flower blooming.
What they saw was butoh, a Japanese dance form invented in the 1960s, in the grim aftermath of the WWII nuclear attacks, during a nationwide art movement reflecting horror, des
olation, and disease. Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno, pioneers of the dance form, led a 
revolt against traditional dance and strove to invent a style that could at once express aware
ness, degradation, and the hope of a new Japan.
Ushio Amagatsu, Sankai Jukus founder, impresario and artistic sovereign, made a new 
contribution to the movement in 1977, when Sankai Jukus first full-scale production, Wa1puC 
ra 3nfBCnr RallgA led to the creation of another work, ^Bn0pn ozanCn Presented in Tokyo in 
1978, its strong impression transformed butoh and, with it, postmodern Japanese art. With 
the maturation of Sankai Juku, Japanese dance has grown away from the masking of human 
emotion and the hesitant, mannered expression of pain. Despite (or perhaps because of) its 
slow pace, each moment matters. Amagatsus choreography expresses suffering, joy, and 
hope in a far more personal way than seems possible.
Sankai Jukus current touring work, WB$B0B2 
CganpnfC ida1 pd 3,p9A was in town for one 
performance only. The show incorporates 
intense, vibrating live sound effects, shallow 
glass reflecting pools, a dusty, cloud-releasing 
stage floor, abstract blood imagery, and light
ing that ranges from barely visible to stark as 
death.
Whatever you may say about [seeing 
Sankai Juku], one theatergoer commented, 
you have to admit its unlike anything else 
youve ever seen before.
Photo courtesy of Masafumi Sakamoto
In England, the show was presented with the 2002 Olivier Award for Best New Dance 
Production. Pittsburgh Dance Councils longstanding relationship with the company has 
resulted in previous visits, but this may be the last Sankai Juku show choreographed by Ushio 
Amagatsu the audiences of Pittsburgh (or any other city) may get to see; he may soon step 
down as Sankai Jukus creative force to pursue a career in opera.
If that fleeting evening of serenity and wonder was to be Pittsburghs last taste of Sankai 
Juku, we will indeed be the poorer for it. But, like a cherry blossom that disappears overnight, 
the memory of its beauty is only magnified.

Uphill battle: repairing yesterdays urban renewal mistakes
Haunted by its past glory 
as an industrial center, 
Pittsburgh is a mid-sized 
midwestern city constantly 
concerned with reinvent
ing itself on a national scale 
through massive projects 
that are primarily con
cerned with image and 
prosperity. But Pittsburgh, 
like New York, is a dwelling 
where neighborhood iden
tity is often more important 
than municipal identity. 
Previous revitalization 
endeavors have razed the 
Hill District.
Urban blight and drug 
addiction symbiotically 
feed off each other and 
totally make up the mosaic 
of a neglected and 
depressed community, 
Sala Udin, a City Council 
representative who is also 
on the Urban
Redevelopment Authority 
(URA) board said. Is it the 
thinking that there have 
been drugs in the Hill so 
long that we might as well 
let it remain there?
The Hill District shows some signs of urban despair but the 
blight is being fought. The revitalization project is receiving 
international attention because unlike previous efforts, it 
involves the neighborhoods denizens. Efforts led by the priv
ileged few to revive Pittsburgh improved the citys image, but 
had devastating effects on the city's historic buildings and on 
poor and minority communities, similar to the aggression of 
Robert Moses (the city planner who transformed New Yorks 
landscape at the expense of many) upon New York. Initial 
rejuvenation projects in the Lower Hill District forced 
outl,500 families  mostly poor African-Americans  and 
more than 400 African-American businesses, including 
stores, social clubs, and the Bethel AME Church, one of the 
oldest AfricanrAmerican churches in the nation.
processes in all aspects of community life: economic, political, 
spiritual, and social, for the ongoing health and prosperity of 
the community.
Hill revitalization plans include a commercial corridor 
along Centre Avenue. Because the corridor runs from 
Downtown to Oakland, development will increase commerce 
for a large area of the city. The first phase will construct a 
complex for residential and retail purposes. The Hill District 
Faade Improvement and Streetface Program is undertaking 
the improvement of the exterior appearance of neighborhood 
businesses. Funds are also available to small businesses 
through loans, though high interest rates and economic insta
bility deter them from taking advantage. Instead many busi
nesses endorse grant programs. The Hill District Business
Community is a new alliance of business owners who seek to 
develop and revitalize the commercial activity in the Hill 
District, to bring people back to the Avenue. Projects are 
social events with unconventional ideas: the association spon
sored a Clean Day festival, at which bars and drug dealers 
alike were asked not to conduct work.
The Hill District has many 
significant assets, including 
Pittsburghs Hill House 
association, a driving force 
for the revitalization proj
ect. The Hill House is a com
munity service organiza
tion, employment agency, 
and the largest employer of 
Hill residents. It also houses 
several local and national 
agencies including WIC, 
Healthy Start, Pittsburgh 
Housing Relocation and the 
Allegheny County Health 
Department.
The now-defunct Ellis Hotel, targeted for demolition, was once a stopping-point for traveling jazz musicians. The hotel is one of many build
ings that are being (and have been) destroyed by politicians ideas of revitalization. The current revitalization, however, seems to be led by the 
people of the Hill, and aims to satisfy the residents of the neighborhood.
The Hill was one of 22 
neighborhoods in the nation 
to be included in the US 
Department of Justices 
Weed and Seed Program 
(weed refers to coordinat
ed, targeted law enforce
ment; seed refers to hous
ing, economic development 
and human services). Since 
its imposition, the 
Department reports a 24 
percent decrease in violent 
crimes in the CrawfordRoberts area. The Operation 
Weed and Seed Strategy col
laborates representatives 
from law enforcement and 
social services (including 
health and educational 
organizations) that attempt
--------------------- to weed out violent crime,
gang activity, and drug use. 
The same organizations seed areas by restoring the neigh
borhoods through social and economic revitalization.
The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, created 
in 1946, is primarily responsible for major municipal projects 
and activities. The same organization carried out the 1950s 
plan that demolished the Lower Hill and controls about 70 
percent of the districts main business corridor.
HOUSING
The first Crawford Square homes available for ownership, 
rent, or council flats were quickly occupied after completion 
in 1993, as were homes built in a subsequent development
Late Pittsburgh historian Roy Lubove wrote in his 1969 
expos 4,CnrBCrz tCnred9 -Brrg$eduz2 HaMCdn1Cnr SegBnCgg 
pny bnMBdan1Cnrpl tzpnuC that it was a rare community to be 
frequently compared to Hell. A visitor [to Pittsburgh] in the 
1880's felt as though he had reached the outer edge of the 
infernal regions...one pictures, as he beholds it, the tortured 
spirits writhing in agony, their sinewy limbs convulsed, and 
the very air oppressive with 
pain and rage. And Lincoln 
Steffens never forgot his 
first impression: It looked 
like hell, literally.
SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENTS
The Hill District Consensus, a citizen-based group, drives 
the theoretical basis for the new revitalization project. Its mis
sion is to work together through the differences and with the 
commonalities, to establish and enforce standards and

let it remain there?

completed in 1995. The URA estimates that more than 2,000 
units of new housing will have been built by 2010 as a result 
of the revitalization project, including projects in the Bedford 
Dwellings and Aliquippa Terrace. It is so far the largest and 
most visible development, situated above the Civic Arena at 
Crawford Street.
Crawford Square raises suspicion. Like many historic cul
tural areas undergoing large urban redevelopment projects, 
residents fear suburbanizing and gentrification. Single family 
homes in the development recently sold for $310,000, blocks 
away from homes that not too long ago would have sold for 
under $100,000.
Hill resident Sheryl King, who used to live in nearby public 
housing, now lives in a two-story, three-bedroom townhouse 
with her two sons. She remarked, "It is very safe here. When I 
leave to go to work at 5 am, it is well-lit. Having two levels 
makes my place feel more like a house than the apartment."
Although the directors of the URA are mostly AfricanAmerican, residents and directors alike are concerned that 
black residents are not the primary investors in the project. A 
multi-million dollar development is only going to turn into a 
multi-million dollar ghetto if you dont create an economic 
base and social structure whereby residents can control it on 
their own, said James F. Henry, executive director of the Hill 
House Association, to 4zC .C, Jad0 4B1Cg in August.
CULTURE
Historically heralded as a jazz cultural center, the main stop 
on the road between New York and Chicago, the Hill wants to 
revive its heritage. The New Granada building, a 1927 art 
deco building originally called the Pythian Temple, was built 
as a lodge for a group of black construction workers known as 
the Knights of the Pythian. The original Granada Theatre on 
Centre Avenue closed and moved two blocks to the Pythian; 
the new location prompted the name change. At the time, it 
was one of four movie theaters in the neighborhood, but after 
the beginning of urban disfigurement, it became the only the
ater. The Hill Community Development Corporation is organ
izing the New Granada Square development, which revolves 
around the renovation of the Theatre on Centre Avenue and

the extensive surrounding area. The 
theater itself will undergo extensive 
interior and exterior restoration as well 
as facilitation for the handicapped. 
Affiliated plans propose housing ten
ants of all economic backgrounds, a 
music studio, banquet and meeting 
rooms, parking space, and an art 
gallery.
The intentions of the revitalization 
project create some resentment. The 
historic Ellis Hotel, originally a YWCA 
for African-American women and later 
a resting spot for vagabond jazz musi
cians, will soon be destroyed. The 
character of this neighborhood is what 
gave Stanley [Turrentine] the juice, 
gave August [Wilson] the juice, gives 
me the juice, said Jorge Myers, an 
artist who lives above the Crawford Hill 
and whose work incorporates boardedup crackhouses and other typically dis
carded materials. The government and 
these developers are taking away our 
juice.
Myerss work can be ideniified by his 
brightly painted ex-crackhouses (some
times called the Shooting Gallery, 
where addicts commonly inject heroin) 
boarded up to prevent people from 
entering. Heroin is to date one of the 
areas most long-term problems. The 
intersection of Centre Avenue and 
Kirkpatrick Street, a notorious drugdealing spot, is central to the neighbor
hood. In response, Udin formed House 
of the Crossroads, a drug treatment cen
ter.
Associated Press
New townhouses on Dinwiddie Street, part of the new Crawford Village in the Hill District.
SKEPTICISM
People think the old times will come back, that the Hill 
will be the center of entertainment, said Mulu Birru, director 
of the URA, to the Post-Gazette on October 2. It is not going 
to be like it used to be before. Birru instead emphasizes 
strong real estate decisions in an area that has suffered many 
urban renewal projects. Plans include a 17,000 square foot 
Save-A-Lot grocery store, new housing, and a Carnegie 
Library building.
In addition to generational skepticism that resulted from 
the devastating attempts at reformation in the 1960s, many 
are suspicious of the URA, including representatives from the 
Hill House. Henry said that the URA failed to address the 
organizations parking needs despite proclamations to the 
contrary. The URA also sold intentionally, undeveloped land 
belonging to the Hill House along Centre Avenue to a devel
oper, Irv Williams, for a an office building called One Hope 
Square. Williams built the Hills first modern office building 
in 1995, Williams Square. He has invested over $8 million in 
the redevelopment project. Williams, a controversial figure, 
has bought several tracts of land to be developed. Instead of 
working with us, we felt that we were shown little or no con
sideration considering the role we played and have played in 
our community over 30 years, said Henry.
Theatre that would provide a 400-seat banquet hall, a glass 
atrium, a courtyard and a supper club seating 260 people, 
reported the -agrGHpLCrrC Neither the URA nor Udin accepted 
the idea. Williamss plan would have displaced Udins House 
of the Crossroad that Udin still oversees as chairman. Udin is 
the social advocate to Williamss Power Broker. They again 
fought over a 2000 purchase of land on Centre Avenue. Udin 
wanted to expand the House of the Crossroads, and Williams 
wanted it for a new office building. The men were forced to 
auction  House of the Crossroads won. The men deny any 
personal animosity. Birru denies any involvement in the poli
tics.
Although the revitalization project involves private politics, 
the politics are personal. All men have lived in the Hill at some 
point. Birru was born and educated in Ethiopia and came to 
Pittsburgh to obtain a graduate degree. Irv Williams as a child 
worked at his fathers Centre Avenue restaurant, Irvs Stop-NGo. Sala Udin is also a native of Pittsburghs Hill District. 
Despite the skepticism of many people, the Hill project is run 
for the people, by the people. And, sadly it is what many revi
talization projects that ultimately result in exploitation must 
learn.

Snap. Crackle. Pop. Jeremy 
Boyle creates art from sound
The closest thing to audio-inspired visual artistry in todays 
pop culture is the vacuous stream of inane music videos catering 
to the contemporary teen consumer.
Supporting commercial viability rather than creativity, MTV 
showcases numerous artists that blend together into one con
gealed blood clot, hindering any flow of innovation in the now 
track-marked veins of todays unhealthy body of artistic medi
ums.
Fortunately, there do exist a few select underground antibod
ies to such artistic infection, like audio/visual auteur and 
Pittsburgh native, Jeremy Boyle, whose exhibit at the Pittsburgh 
Center for the Arts (PCA) runs through October 27.
The exhibit moves from a concentration on the aural to the 
visual, evidencing Boyles interest in inverting the typical rela
tionship between objects and sound. I am interested in the per
ception of sound, expanded beyond the aural experience, reads 
one of his accompanying explanations.
Having earned his chops in sound engineering as the electron
ic component of Chicagos famed art-rock band, Joan of Arc, 27- 
year-old Jeremy Boyle has been cultivating an artistic credibility 
to match his musical achievements. Housed in the sprawling yel
low mansion at the intersection of Fifth and Shady Avenues 
(PCA), Boyles three-room exhibit offers much stimulation in 
quite a limited space.
In the first room of the exhibit is Boyles obsession with aural 
endeavors and the science of sound. An installation dubbed 
Birds employs a microcomputer connected to four sets of elec
tronic circuits and speakers scattered on the wall that produce 
random, computerized chirping noises as if it were an automated 
case-study for the Audubon Society.
In an adjacent dark, curtained room lies one of the shows most 
striking pieces, entitled Untitled. A pool of thick, blue, glycerinbased liquid ripples with undulation as a result of a subwoofer 
playing sub-audible bass beneath. Hanging low from the ceiling 
and directed at a sharp angle to the pool, a lone light illuminates 
the liquids exaggerated resonance patterns on the back wall, for 
a mesmerizing visual representation of aural activity. In this 
case, Boyle writes, a silent sound is seen, and this experience of 
sight is as much a perception of sound.
/ pioneer in the use of digital sound technology, Boyle has 
included in the exhibit a piece that is, by nature, quite antitheti
cal to the ethic of digitally-created music. Aptly named 33.3, 
the installation demonstrates total manipulation of the digital 
technology used to isolate and eliminate the crackle and pop 
from playback of vinyl records on a turntable. A small electronic 
circuit continually reproduces the traditionally unwelcome hiss 
and static of records through a small speaker at low levels. 
Artistically undressed, the piece has no shell, putting the naked 
circuitry on display in a manner that beckons the listener.
Aside from his work with Joan of Arc, Boyle put out an album 
of his own work in 1999 called, oanug ida1 rzC HeBrpd oalag A col
lection of non-conventional music, the album contains songs 
compiled from microseconds of legendary guitar solos from the 
likes of Jimi Hendrix, Kiss, and Van Halen. On display at the PCA 
is the hour-long song, Kiss, an achievement created by isolating 
micro-seconds of a ripping Ace Frehley guitar solo and stretching 
them into layered elements of a wholly new song. Boyles 
description of the process reads, These moments between the 
beats, removed from the structures that gave it form and purpose 
now occupy a newly expanded and loosened time.
It is not in the vein of rebellion to the norm, but rather out of a 
preoccupation with the relationship between aural and visual 
perception that Boyle has crafted such surreal artworks. While 
the exhibit is sure to garner little pop culture acclaim or mass 
interest, it serves to enlighten those willing to suspend their con
ception of sight and sound and experience the electronically 
ethereal.

Part of the Carnegie Museums Japanese film series
In the coming weeks, the Carnegie Museum of Art will feature contemporary Japanese films. The 1999 
movie Y,lDg tpgrlC opens with the citizens of Iga, a ninja village, stowing their children in burrowed-out 
holes in the ground covered with planks and leaves. The children, already trained ninja, will carry on the 
legacy of Iga even after soldiers of Oda Nobunaga ravage their village. Nobunaga, the feudal warlord who 
united Japan under his rule, could not leave a faction to rule and plotted against the village. A small band 
of the Iga tribe survived, and 10 years following the massacre, they were called upon to take revenge by 
killing Nobunagas heir, Hideyoshi. Juzo Tsuzura is the ninja given the task of assassinating Hideyoshi, but 
he questions the political forces behind his masters request.
The complex cycle of politics continues to seethe under the surface despite the warlords unity and pro
claimed loyalty to Hideyoshi. The film is set in 14th century Japan  the era that formed a bridge between 
the feudal system and a modernized industrial Japan under Western influence. The introduction of guns 
brought new possibilities to Japans relations with Europeans, and to the warfront with Korea.
Juzo travels to Kyoto to meet the warlord who has hired him and finds there a beautiful spy and a city 
that has been transformed by the trade of manufacturing guns. The mysterious woman, Kohagi, is in fact 
the adopted daughter of the warlord who hired Juzo, Imai Sokyu. Sokyu plots a coup dtat on the pretext 
that the ruler is mentally unstable. In Kyoto, Juzo also finds his opponent, Gero Shobei. Shobei is a former 
ninja of Iga who fled to the service of warlord Maeda in the hopes of rising in rank from a low-caste ninja 
bandit to a samurai with retainer and 100 0a0e stipend.
Juzo repels attacks from Shobei, Kohagi, and the soldiers of Hideyoshi. Once Juzo has penetrated the 
Osaka castle, he finds Hideyoshis bedroom chamber with the old ruler sleeping. Rather than killing him 
immediately, Juzo wakes the old man and a political and philosophical discourse begins. Juzo questions 
whether he should kill Hideyoshi or spare him, and decides upon the latter. In making his escape, Juzo is 
attacked by Shobei, who wants to capture him for Maeda. Instead Juzo escapes both Shobei and the cas
tle guards that have been given the alarm, and Shobei is captured in his place. Shobeis fate is imprison
ment and torture as an example for those that would plot against Hideyoshi, a fair karmic reward for his 
betrayal of Iga. Juzo returns to Kohagi and together they flee society for a peaceful life together away from 
plotting warlords and ninja pawns.
The fight scenes were not as intricate as in great Japanese films like the 1960s segpgzB series or HanLp 
rzC oICpd1pn (1985), but were still quite exciting. This epic brought a feeling of nostalgia and heartened 
pride in the age-old traditions and complexity of Japanese society, especially the role of mercy as repre
sented in the thinking ninja. Y,lDg tpgrlC is a refreshing change from the James Bond approach to spy 
action movies.

If you enjoy seeing altar boys running, screaming, and tripping

From what Ive heard, this movie is a lot like HayLBllpA only its a 
dragon instead of some random monster. So I guess its about a big 
lizard that stomps things AND breathes fire. The other thing I heard 
is that the dragon in it mixes chemicals in his mouth in order to 
make the fire, so it is essentially an educational film. Everything is 
educational when put into the proper terms, right? Life is all about 
learning, and as we know, book learning isnt always the best way 
to do it. Its about getting out and experiencing life, even if its life 
dominated by a stomping lizard spewing flame.

Yet another movie where people are trying to kill Tom Cruise. 
And who could blame them, the way hes always racking up money 
and women by making movies about people trying to kill him? This 
movie is futuristic, so its slightly different than all the other ones. 
Tom plays a guy whos on the crime fighting force and they all have 
the ability to see into the future and arrest people before they com
mit crimes. The problem arises when they see that Tom is going tc 
kill someone, even though he isnt aware of this yet. So he has to 
run and dodge bullets and make out with a woman or two before he 
reaches his happy ending. At least thats what I hope he does, 
because it is essential that he continue making movies where peo
ple are trying to kill him.

To balance out all these adventure and male-dominated movies,

many, I bet.

TUESDAY 08
Horoscopes for the 
Petty Bourgeoisie
ARIES (March 21 April 19): Be careful! The doctor said its 
a TOPICAL treatment. You dont want to add digestion prob
lems to your list of already embarrassing ailments.
TAURUS (April 20  May 20): Relax. Those nightmares 
youve been having  where a giant feathered demon bird car
ries you away in its talons  are not real premonitions, just an 
indication of your future as a Giant Eagle checkout clerk.
GEMINI (May 21  June 21): You can 
stop being paranoid now. Whatever its 
name may sound like, the Salvation 
Army is out to clothe you in polyester, 
not convert you at gunpoint.
CANCER (June 22  July 22): Face 
it. No matter who you write to, Lulu and 
Pamela arent going to duke it out on Iron Chef. They are just too 
classy to sell out like that.
LEO (July 23  August 22):
Obsessing over her like this will not 
get you anywhere. Take some initia
tive! Ask her what her name is.
VIRGO (August 23  September 
22): Becoming a foreign exchange 
student might be a good plan on some level, but you must real
ize that just because you wont understand what your new 
friends are saying, doesnt mean they wont be making fun of 
you.
LIBRA (September 23  October 23): No matter what your 
dad told you to get you into it in junior high, being a ham radio 
operator will not help you pick up hot alien chicks.
SCORPIO (October 24  November 
21): The military welcomes you with 
open arms, and not in the good way.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 
December 21): Everyone already knows 
about your romance novel fixation. On 
the upside, no matter what you do or say, 
they could not possibly think less of you.
CAPRICORN (December 22  January 19): After an experi
ence like tomorrows fiendish, torturous, Spawn of Satan, beingchased-by-a-possessed-porcupine-that-swallowed-an-agitatedskunk kind of a day, life can only improve.
AQUARIUS (January 20 
February 18): Stop complaining. 
Some people have an even sadder 
dateless future, like dead folks and 
monks, and you dont see them being 
so openly sexually frustrated.
PISCES (February 19  March 20): 
Your printer will soon run out of ink. Prepare the cellar while 
you still have your sanity and world order has not yet collapsed.
