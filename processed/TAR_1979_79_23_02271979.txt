60 MINUTES Ticks
by Jean Pellegrini
Last Thursday, Harry Reasoner, nation
ally renowned newscaster and one of four 
hosts of CBS 60 MINUTES, came to Pitts
burgh to interview CMU psycho-pharma
cologist, Dr. Klaus Miczek. The interview 
and film of a staged experiment will be 
part of 60 MINUTES  second segment on 
drugs and their effects, to be broadcast next 
month.
Reasoner and Dick Clark, producer for 
60 MINUTES, were interested in Miczeks 
experiments with mice and rats in which 
Miczek found that a single, low dose of 
marijuana causes a very drastic decrease 
in aggression, without altering general 
health, motor coordination, eating or sleep
ing habits. 
According to Reasoner, the objective of 
this segment, which focuses on marijuana 
legalization, is to inform the public about 
the current thinking, from both sides, of 
scientists and sociologists. 
Reasoner stated, the aim of the first 
broadcast (one month ago) was to inform 
the viewers of the incredible amounts of 
marijuana being brought into the country 
and the large numbers of adolescents smok
ing marijuana.  He explained that in the 
second broadcast, 60 MINUTES will be 
doing investigative work  paralleling 
marijuana legalization and the ending of 
Prohibition. If the situation is the same as 
it was with Prohibition, there is no point 
in trying to keep people from doing this,  
Reasoner suggested in explanation of the 
broadcasts purpose.
Dr. Miczeks experiments interested the 
60 MINUTES  staff because of the poten
tial correlation between the laboratory re
sults and adolescent behavior with respect 
to marijuana use. (60 MINUTES' research 
team found out about Miczeks work 
through a news release sent from CMUs 
PR department to a national PR firm in 
Boston.)
Miczek believes, based on the results of 
extensive tests on laboratory animals, that 
many recreational drugs, including 
marijuana, do not cause aggressive 
behavior, and in most cases, can actually 
cause users to become less violent  even if 
taken on a regular basis. 
Miczek has studied the effects of co
caine, marijuana, amphetamines, and alco
hol on colonies of rats, mice and squirrel 
monkeys. By putting these animals in at
tack situations  where a new animal of 
the same species is placed in with an 
established colony Miczek observed the 
normal aggressive actions of the resident 
attacker, usually the Icing male of the 
colony (TARTAN, January 16, 1979).
In a fourth -floor lab in Baker Hall, Rea
soner and Clark questioned Miczek about 
his experiments. They asked, Could you 
draw any conclusions about marijuana use 
and adolescent behavior, based on your ex
periments? 
Miczek replied, No. I am not ready to 
do that. The experiments would not allow 
for extrapolation on the effects and behav
ior of 13 or 14 year olds who use mari
juana.My experiments are on animals, and 
while they suggest some implications for 
humans, there is no proved correlation be
tween the two. 
The primary reason for the lack of 
proof, Miczek explains, is that 
cannot observe the situation of self-aim mi
st rat ion of marijuana  animals do not 
self-administer marijuana. 
To draw any correlation, every possi
ble aspect mast be observed and, in reality, 
you cant get animals to take marijuana. 
In contrast, it is a totally different picture 
when experimenting with cocaine [on 
monkeys], for example, because the drug 
is placed in the cage and the situation of 
self-administration can be observed, Mic
zek asserted.

SDC Elects 
New Officers
by MindieJo Snyder
Sunday, February 18, the Student 
Dorm Council held elections for its 
executive board. The enthusiasm shown by 
the entire council, particularly during the 
race for president, has been unprecidented. 
Results of the elections are as follows. Jim 
Balsom, President; Cheryl Schellenberg, 
Vice President of Morewood; MindieJo 
Snyder, Vice President of the Hill Area; 
Bill Reiner, Treasurer, for a second term; 
and Bret Fennell, Secretary.
With the election of the new executive 
board, plans have been made to strengthen 
Council. The First step in SDCs new look 
is the establishment of permanent office 
hours: Monday, 3:45 - 4:45; Tuesday, 
1:30 - 2:30; Wednesday, 12:15 * 1:15; 
Thursday, 12:00 - 1:00; Friday, 10:30 - 
11:30. Office hours will be in effect as of 
Monday, March 5. Students are encouraged

Dr. Klaus Miczek explains his agression tests to Harry Reasoner.
An experiment with rats was staged for 
the 60 MINUTES crew to film. Clark ask
ed if the before and after results would 
be obvious enough for viewers to observe 
extremes of be!* vjor. Miczek replied that 
it would be overdoing it  "to expect to 
see fighting and then the absence* of fight
ing, after the THC injection.
While the camera crew was setting up, 
Reasoner explained that th^60 MINUTES  
investigation is being done with the intent 
of giving people a basis for making up 
their minds. If marijuana was to be legal
ized, smugglers could be put out of bus
iness and there would be some form of 
quality control. On the other hand, reg
ular marijuana smoking is not a good idea.
Any kind of mind-altering is not. Legaliza
tion would mean some increase in usage.
In the first broadcast it was pointed out 
that of 16 million marijuana users, 45 
million are between the ages of 15 and 17. 
Mizceks work interested the segments 
producer, Clark, because it was a possible 
step toward understanding the effects of 
marijuana usage on adolescents.
When asked about what possible effect 
the 60 MINUTES  news-documentary on 
marijuana could have on US legislators, 
Clark responded,Either outlaw marijuana
and enforce the law or legalize it. Meager 
efforts are presently being made to accom
plish the former.  60 MINUTES attempts 
to objectively inform, he added.
Nature Policy
Environmental values and value prior
ities are not some separate or isolated set 
of concerns but are intertwined inseparately with other values and issues, asserted 
Richard N. L. Andrews at the first of a ser
ies of Values and Public Policy lectures 
held this past Thursday.
Andrews, who is an associate professor 
at the University of Michigans School of 
Natural Resources, stated, We need to 
protect ecosystem functions . . . that sup
port human life and the life of other spe
cies around us.
He did not call for the protection of 
every species in every occasion, and cited 
that legislation stopping projects when an 
endangered species was threatened might 
be too rigid when all factors were not 
weighed.
Andrews also disagreed with the notion 
that the world is a lifeboat and some peo
ple are not going to survive. He declared, 
We need to keep our priorities straight about human values and the environment. 
People are part of ecosystems, and the 
community of human species is more 
important than narrowly-concerned poli
cies to protect a few people who are well 
enough off to defend themselves against 
what they take to be the masses. We need.
Richard Andrews addressed guidelines for Na
tional environmental policies.
in short, to keep our eyes very strongly on 
the necessity of reducing human misery. 
He also warned against ''overdepen
dence on a particular system or method 
of energy use. He called for flexibility and

Spring Carnivals theme this year is 
Countries. Therefore, it seems appropri
ate that the success of at least one event in 
the big tent on April 20 depends very 
much on the contributions and coopera
tion of 15% of the student body. That 
15%, of course, is CMUs foreign students.
The intercultural event, not yet de
tailed, will bring together people of all 
backrounds, and hopefully, will mark the 
beginning of an uplifted consciousness on 
campus for more social interaction be
tween the American and foreign students.
The Cultural Programming Committee 
has been allocated the hours of noon to 5 
PM on the Friday of Carnival Weekend for 
gtheir event. This Committee strongly urges 
o all interested students, especially foreign, 
to attend a meeting tomorrow, February
5'28 at 7:30 PM in Skibo Room 11, to fur
s ther define overall goals and plan the event 
 which best exemplifies those goals.O
John Tumazos, Student Government 
President, indicated that money for the 
event most likely will come from Student 
Senate in the form of unspent funds of the 
Student Government Fund and Activities 
Fair Committee budgets. Senate will be 
voting on this tonight. Tumazos alsoireported encouraging discussions with

Faculr
Notes
TARTAN
Sunshine and Roses
Our Warner Hall administrators are quite clever. They ob
viously weren't happy with the news being printed in 
FOCUS, CMUs faculty staff newspaper. The award-winning 
monthly, supported by university funds, had a habit of re
porting the news "the way it was.  Exposes, articles on con
troversial issues, and satirical columns had been finding their 
way into the newspaper. With lightbulbs flashing atop their 
heads, the administrators decided that if they didnt like the 
news, they'd make their own news. And their own news
paper. So on February 16, the CAMPUS CHRONICLE 
made its first appearance in staff faculty mailboxes around 
campus.
Called a new publication of the Public Relations Depart
ment, " it is pure, schlocky, PR baloney. It is supposed to 
supplement FOCUS, but any CMU employee or faculty 
member who took the time to read the publication, 
couldn't help but read between the lines. The CAMPUS 
CHRONICLE should have just stated its purpose right there 
on its front page: We are an alternative administrative pub
lication designed to give you information the way we want 
you to have it. "
A t the University of Pittsburgh, administrators were dis
satisfied with how the faculty newspaper was handling 
touchy issues. Last week, proceedings began before Pitt's 
Faculty Assembly that could wind up with administrationimposed censorship. Luckily, CMU's Warner Hallites aren't 
taking that route.
But regardless of how inoffensive the CAMPUS CHRON
ICLE seems, it is an insult to the faculty and staff of CMU. 
They shouldnt be force-fed "sugar and spice and every
thing's nice because that type of journalism cannot always 
be trusted.
The first issue of the CHRONICLE asks for suggestions 
for future articles. The TARTAN believes that there should 
be no future articles or future issues of the publication. Any 
article that would appear in the CHRONICLE could just as 
well appear in FOCUS. There is no need for extra money to 
be spent on a second newspaper. If Warner Hall adminis
trators have something to say, space in FOCUS should be 
made available.
Will there be a second issue of CAMPUS CHRONICLE? 
If there is, the TARTAN would tike this editorial printed in 
it. We re mailing it to the PR office as our first suggestion 
for a future article."
Distant Thunder
Give it a few months.
The frats will be having "End of the World parties and 
instead of setting off paper mache volcanoes, they'll be 
building mushroom clouds. They'll serve kool-aid-mixers 
and theyll dance and party until they drop.
Maybe it'll be in a few weeks.
Instead of heading home for the Spring Holidays, we 7/ 
be hitch iking to Canada. All of us (men and women alike) 
will meet in Montreal, where well pray that the wind 
currents don't blow the nuclear fall-out northward. We'll 
read in the MONTREAL STAR that one of the U.S.s 
top industrial cities doesnt exist anymore. The only remain
ing fixture in the city will be a 20 foot long fence, which 
survived due to hundreds of layers of protective paint.
Or perhaps it'll be in a few days.
We'll be watching Mork and Mindy or well be listening 
to WD VE. Then, the screen will be monopolized by a testpat tern, or the radio will broadcast a shrill buzzing. Then 
we'll hear laughing, and a voice will chuckle, "this is not a 
test...this is the real thing! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Could it be tomorrow?
What are our Wednesday classes, anyway? Can we miss 
them? If China really does a number on Vietnam, and 
Russia decides its time to show China whos boss, and 
Khomeini, Idi Amin and Yasar Arafat figure theyll organize 
a few riots to distract us....well, then what? Will Unde Sam 
reach his hands into American universities and grab us all 
for the front lines?
Well, it's today; Tuesday, February 27.
What does the Pittsburgh Press have to say about things? 
Have you read the N.Y. Times this morning? Let's not 
just turn to the comics today. What's going on on the other 
side of the world had better concern us, because our fates 
are not always our own to determine. We are the pawns of 
the politics in this world. Maybe ignorance is bliss, but 
nuclear war is a real bummer.Jeffrey Zaslow

Editor:
I want to complain! Nothing in 
particular is bothering me, I just 
feel like complaining. Here is a list 
of all the petty complaints which 
I have, and which no one will 
bother to do anything about, 
anyway:
1) People at CMU have a habit 
of using phrases which contradict 
themselves. Because of this, you 
can never really understand what 
they mean. For instance, take the 
phrase Skibo food.
2) Whenever you have a big 
computing assignment due the 
next day which you havent start
ed yet, TOPS-C blows up or 
something. Not only is this incon
venient, but think of the nerds! 
Did you ever see what happens to 
a computer nerd when the mach
ine goes down? Its really a pathe
tic sight. But thats okayat least 
they get a chance to wash their 
hair.
3) Who the hell is SEV? Yeah,
I know. Hes a load. Wow. Hes 
the most famous person on cam
pus, and nobodys ever seen him. 
Rumour has it that hes hiding in 
Hamerschlag, but lots of things 
hide in Hamerschlag.
4) Who the hell is Post?
5) Why am I forced to trudge 
all the way from Doherty to Donner, across the vast, snow-covered 
expanse of Tech field, just to get 
my mail? By the time I get a letter 
back to my room, its outdated. 
And what about those poor souls 
on the Hill who have to walk half
way to New York to mail a letter?
6) If I wanted to go to a sauna, 
Id go to a sauna. Instead, I go to 
see SDC movies, and they give me 
movies AND a sauna, along with a 
seat if I arrive a few hours early.
7) Why dont people have the 
guts to sign their names on their 
letters to the editor, and not have 
them withheld? If what you have 
to say is really that bad, then send 
it to the National Enquirer or 
something.

A Relevant Fairy Tale 
Editor:
Once upon a time, there was a 
young man who wanted more 
than anything else to become a 
carpenter. His parents told him: 
Go to the university, where there 
are professors who know the en
tire sum of human knowledge. 
They will prepare you well! So 
off he went to school, looking for
ward to learning how A-frames 
and split-levels and ranch houses 
are built. But when he got to the 
university, he found that if he 
wanted to become a carpenter, he 
would have to take Structure of 
Hammers I and Construction of 
Screwdrivers I. He figured that, 
oh well, hed have to take the bas
ics before he could get to the 
really interesting practical stuff. 
Besides, he reasoned, professors 
know better than freshmen what 
carpenters need to know right?

Bill Dillon, Director of Auxiliary Services, presents a short quiz for CMU dorm residents.VIEWS
In my twelve years at the 
university, I have found no series 
of facts which are more misperceived, misquoted and misunder
stood than the facts related to 
CMU housing costs. This misun
derstanding leads to senseless 
destruction, needless waste, con
tinuous ill feelings and sometimes 
open hostility as some students 
attempt to get their moneys 
worth. I frequently confront 
situations where students are 
discharging fire extinguishers, 
shooting shaving cream around 
the bathroom or simply throwing 
trash on the floor instead of the 
nearest waste container and the 
only rational explanation which I 
have heard is that there is a feeling 
that we have paid for the right to 
do these things. I talk with cus
todial people daily as I walk the 
buildings and find that the sense
less destruction and waste is the 
single greatest crippler of morale 
among the Housing workforce.
It is true that students are 
under a .great deal of pressure at 
CMU. Its also true that staff me
mbers make mistakes, act ineffi
ciently and dont always work as 
hard as they could. But the single 
greatest productive waste seems to 
come from the efforts which are 
constantly spent putting the place 
back together. In hopes of impro
ving this situation I have created 
the following quiz. I hope this de
vice will succeed, where others 
failed, to communicate the great 
expense related to operating a 
residence hall system and will 
result in a new dedication on the 
part of everyone to work to 
reduce these costs.

By now I am sure that you 
have looked at the answers. If you 
guessed all the answers correctly 
without looking you may request 
to be considered as Housing 
Director of the Day. That is, if 
you wish to spend a day listening 
to roommate problems, contract 
disputes, explanations for why the 
room deposit cannot be paid on 
time, dealing with lost keys, over
due mail, dirty bathrooms and the 
continuous problems which inevi
tably occur in any city over 2,000 
people. If you missed at least one 
question please agree to join me in 
an effort to make residence hall 
living a little better, more efficient 
and more economical in the 
future. Thank you.

- So all his time was spent learn
ing all that was known about the 
molecular structures of hammers, 
screwdrivers, nails and wood. By 
his senior year, however, he real
ized that not one lecture had been 
devoted to learning how hammers 
are used to drive nails, much less 
learning how to put a house to
gether. He became concerned 
about this lack of practical 
instruction, and he went to talk to 
his professors.
Its important, they told 
him to know exactly how ham
mers are constructed. Suppose 
youre a carpenter and the ham
mer companies go out of busi
ness? Where would that leave 
you? As for learning how houses 
are built, you can pick that up 
easily enough once youre on the 
job. We cant teach you how to 
build houses here, because the 
methods are changing so fast that 
what youd have learned would be 
obsolete when you get out. 
Youre better off learning the im
portant fundamentals instead! Be
sides, we dont have the money to 
buy the equipment necessary to 
teach every student who wants to 
learn how to build houses.
So the young man completed 
his senior year and was graduated 
from the university. Sure enough, 
he picked up enough in his first 
year working for a contractor to 
go into business for himself and 
become a very successful carpen
ter. But people wondered why he 
didnt send his kids to college.

Editor:
As Editor Zaslow well knows, 
that as a fellow writing major and 
Co-Chairman of Black Awareness 
Week 79 I could not accept his 
most recent editorial without a 
written response, which, by the 
way, will give the TARTAN 
another juicy tid-bit of black/ 
white controversy to sustain it for
another week. So, Mr. Zaslow, 
here you are. Due to fast ap
proaching mid-terms, I will keep 
this relatively short, fortunate 
for you.
To put it mildly, 1 do not 
appreciate your constant patron
izing attitude toward Black Awareness Week, the hypocritical 
relationship you pose to me 
personally, your account of halftruths and reorganized quotes in 
Black Week Blues (2/20/79), 
your uncooperative views and 
actions throughout the Week, or 
your holier-than-thou attitude 
used to shaft CMU students into 
thinking you are really on their 
side. In accordance with Dick 
Gregory, it is a shame when you 
cannot trust the mass media to 
give you the truth, but when the 
TARTAN has the audacity to 
jump on the bandwagon, its 
damn ridiculous.
First of all, your statement 
that the TARTAN was behind 
Black Week 100% is a blatant
lie. The TARTAN did absolutely 
nothing for Black Week. All the 
articles written for the week, 
totally six, / wrote, after one of 
four editors told me and CoChairman James Patterson that if 
we wanted anything in the TAR
TAN that would be the only 
way it would get there. Secondly, 
I sent all the articles to your 
Features editor, except one, yet 
they all appeared in the Enter
tainment section (including the 
piece on Lane and Gregory) 
as usual in the back of the 
bus. Thirdly, when Spring Carni
val chairman and SARC pres
ident are chosen, it has been 
customary that there is a front 
page article to announce the 
appointment, yet for Black Week, 
James and I remained unan
nounced (excuse me, we did get 
a sentence in the Senate Mur
murs column. Somehow that 
slipped my mind). The Tartan 
knew of our appointments yet no
thing was said or done for us.
If you call actions like these as 
being behind Black Week, then 
please stay in front of us where 
we can see your knife more 
clearly.
Now back to the Lane/Gregogry publicity. As a point of 
information, CMUs public rela
tions department handled public
ity for the lecture which I clearly 
remember telling you in our 
phone conversation from which 
your editorial was unknowingly 
based. I noticed this fact was 
tactfully deleted.
Anyway, your assumption that 
the TARTANs run of the Lane 
photo brought in the entire 
white population is quite bold 
to say the least. You give the 
TARTAN a lot more credit than 
anyone else does. How dare you 
say there was no effort made by 
our committee to have some
thing in your paper? Youd 
better check back and read your 
TARTANs more closely. The 
something was an article I wro---------------------------------------------------

more Letters
te that you and your staff buried 
somewhere between the transves
tite ballet and a Sha Na Na con
cert. I didnt like it when it came 
out then and I hate it even more 
now. Also PR sent another news 
release on the lecture which you 
told me you received yet did not 
print. Also, your remark that an 
ad placed in the TARTAN for 
such an event is always necessa
ry is the most ?w-subtle attempt 
at a free commercial 1 have ever 
seen and 1 would think that you 
would have some scruples as to 
using your position as Editor, 
thus student spokesman, in such 
a manner. 1 explained to you 
over the phone our budget 
problems yet you chose not to 
include that information in your 
editorial. Lets be complete in our 
reporting, aspiring journalist. 
Gregory and Lane were adver
tised on the complete Black 
Awareness Week poster placed all 
over campus. It is not my fault 
that the average white on this 
campus has an aversion to the 
word Black that forces him to 
look away whenever he sees it.
And the banner was not late. 
True, it was not there two weeks 
ahead of time but why should 
it be? Students tend to forget 
things told to them too far in 
advance, as you well know. 
Another fact, the Warner Hall 
mix-up, etc., omitted from your 
article explained why the banner 
was not put up a few days earlier. 
And Jeff, you did not have to 
track down members of the 
committee because you knew 
perfectly well that I was the 
head of it and you also knew that 
I work as a typesetter for the 
TARTAN and hence would have 
been in during the week. Finally, 
I detest your terminology in 
referring to Black Awareness
week as the big show. This is 
not a circus, regardless of how 
you may look at it. It is that 
attitude exactly that the commit
tee has tried so hard to dispel 
over the years.
So, Mr. Zaslow, in the future 
when writing your editorials, get 
in the habit of making sure you 
have your facts correct and 
complete for when you get into 
the outside world, you will not 
have the same passive blacks to 
lie about or die same passive 
whites to lie to. Somebody out 
there will not stand for it and I 
dont believe hes going to tell 
you so through a written re
sponse.

Co-Chairman Black Awareness 
Week Committee 79
Editor's Note: The Editorial
Board of the TARTAN stands 
behind last week's editorial,
Black Week Blues. 
.....and, furthermore,....
Editor:
In two years at CMU, I have 
seen criticism of Black Week for 
various reasons. These criticisms 
have been followed by changes to 
make the week more appealing 
to whites.
1 am sick of Black Week being 
followed by the TARTANs 
Black Week is a great idea, but 
articles. This year, the TARTAN 
was not satisfied with publicity or 
.he Gregory/Lane lecture. In their
opinion, if they didnt de
mand a photo of Mark Lane, the 
white attendance would have been 
insignificant.
Actually, the lecture was suc
cessful in spite of the TARTAN. 
An article with information about 
the lecture appeared in a previous 
issue of the TARTAN. However, 
it was placed in Entertainment. 
Had that article been on the first 
page, student attendance would 
have been increased. Why such an 
important article was not put on 
the cover is a question for the ed
itor. Perhaps he has some organiz
ational problems of his own.
As co-chairperson of Black 
Week, I am very aware that we 
had many organizational prob
lems. Organizing an event the size 
of this years Black Week while 
going to classes at CMU is no sim
ple task. I have no doubt that 
other committees planning similar 
events have the same problem. De
spite any difficulties we may have 
had, Black Week 1979 was a great 
success.
The TARTANs editorial criti
cisms of the lecture were com
pletely unfounded. The Gregory/ 
Lane lecture was intended to make 
one see the immorality of this 
country. There is nothing moral 
about a country that placed dic
tators in Iran and Chile, and mur
dered one of humanitys greatest 
spokesmen. Who Killed Martin 
Luther King, was not just con
cerned with Kings assassination, 
it was more concerned with the 
sickness of a country and a people 
that allow it to happen and go 
unchallenged. If the TARTANs 
editor cant understand the logic 
in that, as angry as I may be, I can 
only pity him.
James Patterson 
Co-Chairman of Black Week
Kudos to Black Week 
Editor:
I would like to express my ap
preciation and congratulations to 
all of the students, faculty and 
staff who volunteered their valu
able time and efforts to program 
and run CMUs Black Week 79.
I was able to attend six of the 
nine scheduled events and I know 
that a lot of planning and worry
ing must have gone into co-ordinating a program of events so broad 
in scope. In particular, Im speak
ing of the Dinner-Fashion ShowDisco and die Talent Sliou . It was 
a real pleasure (and in sone cases, 
a surprise) to see some of the 
hidden attributes and special 
talents of a few of my fellow stu
dents. One couldnt help but be 
reminded that a student, believe it 
or not, is a person first and there 
is more to know and learn about 
people than can be learned in a 
classroom.
I sincerely hope that all of the 
members of the CMU community 
(students, faculty, staff & friends) 
had the pleasure of attending at 
least a few of the Black Week 
events.
Michael D. Alston
In Gregory's Defense 
Editor:
It has been three, long years 
since. I enrolled in CMU. For three 
years. Ive heard negative, closeminded. closehearted reactions
from individuals regarding the 
affairs and welfare of AfricanAmerican students on campus. 
The reaction of Jeff Zaslow falls 
into this category, and it is my 
intention to direct my energy to 
such blatant accusations of Dick 
Gregory as a progagandist.
Mr. Zaslow, I must tell you 
one tiling. You have a way with 
words. You have a unique way of 
affecting your reader. It is too 
bad that because of your misin
terpretation of general facts that 
you affect them in a negative way, 
as in this case of your views on 
the Black Week speaker, Dick 
Gregory.
Regarding Gregory,^pouting 
pure unfounded rhetoric, what 
do you mean by that statement? 
It seemed to me that Gregory was 
not trying to propagate or promo
te any kind of ideology or prin
ciple, but to awaken the social, 
and political conscience of the 
people present who were listening 
to what the brother had to say. 
He was telling us about the racist, 
sexist, and materialistic dictates 
under which this Land of the 
Free, and Home of the Brave 
operates.
You may take note that I 
mentioned racist first, and that is 
because I detect very racist over
tones in your usage of the word, 
and I dont care if you put 
parenthesis around it. I must 
confess however, that I dont and 
did not appreciate the usage of 
that word by Gregory, but I 
challenge your justification for 
using that word. Besides, Gregory 
was addressing the whole , but it 
so happened that what he talked 
about did pertain particularly 
to African-American people. What 
also gets me, is that, any other
people: Jews, Indians, etc., can 
make even more direct appeals to 
their own, and nobody will chal
lenge them, so why pick at Gre
gory for such a trivial occurence?
You accuse Gregoryof at
tacking American Society, go
vernment, etc., but I declare to 
you, and to anybody who ques
tions Gregorys ideals, that any 
nation which has such a history of 
mental and physical slavery, lies, 
war, murder, rape, imperialism, 
and countless _ other isms and 
osm (Remember when Gregory 
used those terms?), needs to be 
exposed and opposed!
You compared Gregory and his 
audience to a southern preacher 
and his captive congregation. 
Captive Congregation! It appeared 
to me that the people saw value in 
the brothers delivery, and gave 
him their undivided attention by 
choice, and not by any kind of 
blind convictions. Ill tell you 
something also, it is people 
like you, who are captives. You 
are captive to a way of thinking 
that limits your growth and devlopment as a human being. It 
seems to me that you are so cap
tivated by an unnatural, racist 
mind, that you'cant see past your 
nose when it comes to the affairs 
of African-American people.
When you called Gregorys 
various statements  too il
logical to take seriously, you 
might as well had called him a 
ball-faced liar! Im not going to 
expand any on this particular line, 
but if you want to learn for your
self read for yourself about vari
ous political happenings, and then 
maybe you will be able to write 
what is logical enough to take 
seriously.
Did you say Gregory was 
boring? Youve got to be kid
ding! That man displayed 
charisma, and candor that Ive 
seen very few display (people 
such as Malcolm X and Dr. 
King). No boring speaker can 
hold the attention of an aud
ience like Gregory did.
In closing, I want to say thisJeff, I dont know you or much 
about you, but I do believe that 
you are a victim of misinforma
tion and misinterpretation of what 
Dick Gregory was about. I further
more believe that you are too intel 
ligent to write in the manner in 
which you did, and not expect 
iny reply from the African-Amer
icans on campus. You can trust 
this will not be the last letter to 
your statements, and it surely will 
not be mine.

A Close Call
Editor:
I just got fed up with hoping 
for an unbiassed opinion in the 
TARTAN; so Ive decided to pro
duce a newsletter of my own 
named the Close Call. Of course 
I am seeking the help and ideas of 
others who share my interests. 
The Close Call will aim at stud
ent and adult interests by pre
senting views and opinions ex
pressed by the people themselves 
on subjects ranging from age to 
sex. Oply those who speak with 
specifics in mind will be heard by 
the Close Call. The Close Call 
will refer to names, dates and 
places when subjecting anyone 
or any group to harsh criticism. 
Close Call will not discuss racial 
conflicts. Take all of your 
problems and hangups home since 
thats where they came from. 
Many students and some faculty 
are unaware of the potential 
barrier that exists between 
themselves and their world. 
Current news is usually biased in 
one direction or another depend
ing on the amount of resistance 
there is toward the issue. We will 
try to be non-conventional; that 
is, our thoughts will be on the 
line rather than between the lines. 
The community at CMU repre
sents a small fraction of those 
who will surely lead our society in 
years soon to come. Lets say 
(at CMU) start acting like ra
tional decision makers. By the 
way, there is so much more to life 
than blacks and blues, bottles of 
beer and binary babes. So become 
a member of the Close Call Staff. 
We will print good news, comics 
and fiction(evcn if they are the 
same thing). We dont care about 
color if you can feel and think. 
Thank you.

Let Us Breathe 
Editor:
Im a junior, majoring in elec
trical engineering. Im now in my 
second semester at CMU. I trans
ferred here of my own free will, 
and I have no one to blame but 
myself. Ill be out of here in a 
year, and I suppose 1 can last that 
long.
My time here has been sheer 
exasperation. I am constantlyamazed *that a university could 
have such outstanding resources, 
and be so determined not to take 
advantage of them. When we 
come here we seem to be classifi
ed (according to our majors, of 
course) as either bureaucrats, 
technocrats, or sensitive types. 
And our rigidly defined' programs 
keep us from straying very far, 
from ever finding out much about 
what other people are thinking 
about. We are constantly having 
to choose between school work 
and learning.
Why cant there be some sort 
of University Major, akin to a 
University Professorship, a stud
ent-defined program drawing free
ly on the resources that we 
have? Artists and actors and en
gineers and psychologists do in
deed live in the same world, and 
if CMU would recognize it it 
could become a genuinely first 
rate university.
I have composed this letter in 
my head a hundred times, but Im 
finally writing it down because 
Buckminster Fuller is going to 
speak in the Skibo Ballroom on 
February 28th, at 7:30. I was 
lucky enough to hear him several 
years ago, and it was an extraord
inary experience. Many people 
found him irritating and confus
ing, and many walked out, but 
when he was finished he received 
an instant standing ovation. After 
a moment or two he said, You 
know, youre really applauding 
yourselves. He rambles and di
gresses wildly, but his perspective is 
utterly unique. I think that it is 
this global perspective, this sense 
of the implications of our actions, 
that we are lacking here, and Im 
hoping that his visit may move us 
to close the gap.
Sincerely, 
Andy Judkis 
Forbes Street Gallery
Editor:
The following letter was sent 
to Dean Midani of Fine Arts and 
Orville Winsand, Head of the Art 
Department.
Im writing to express my firm 
commitment and the student 
bodys consensus that the Forbes 
Street Gallery provides an invalu
able service to the campus com
munity. Not only does it permit 
art and design students to display 
their work, but we all have the 
opportunity to enjoy the Gallery 
exhibitions. Last spring I bought 
a painting of the Wilkinsburg Rail
road Station done by Mark Bursick, which I originally saw on dis
play at the Gallery.
The Student Senate has and is 
prepared to continue to contri
bute to the Gallery's support. This 
year we are planning to budget 
S2500-2700 toward the Gallery's 
operating expenses.
However, a much larger ques
tion is involved when we examine 
appropriations for fixtures, rent.

---------------------------------------------------

more Letters
and utilities. I am quite aware that 
substantial expenditures are need
ed for new plate glass windows, 
carpeting, and other fixtures. The 
students themselves have request
ed that Student Senate fund the 
carpet. These items are clearly be
yond the realm of our very limit
ed Student Activities Budget. We 
cannot afford to provide and 
maintain the space itself.
The assistance of the Art De
partment and the College of Fine 
Arts itself will be vital in order to 
continue the invaluable service 
that the Gallery provides both to 
your students and to the entire 
campus community. Again, I can
not emphasize enough how im
portant the continued existence 
of the Forbes Street Gallery is to 
the students.
The Student Senate is current
ly appropriating the Student Ac
tivities budget for next year. In 
order to reserve an appropriate 
sum of money for Forbes Street 
Gallery, please reply concerning 
your position regarding support of 
the Gallery within seven days.
Thank you for your time and 
consideration.

How's That?
Editor:
The article University Costs 
Rise is a bit deceptive, because it 
does not account for inflation. 
The weighted average of the cost 
rise figures cited is 100.279%, 
which is slightly below the overall 
rise in the consumer price index 
for that period. In real terms, un
iversity operating costs are down,
and some categories, such as pro
fessional salaries (up 78% against 
105% inflation) have declined 
sharply in real terms.

A Cause for Concern
Editor:
I know that a lot of time has 
gone by since this was news, but 
the only thing that I can think of 
to the purpose that doesnt 
require much time is miseducation.
I want to say that I think there 
should have been some marking
of the death of Andrew Finnerty 
and I think that Dean Swank is 
remiss in not having arranged it. 
The University may hold as an 
ideal a future world in which 
death goes unremarked, but I 
am one student, at least, who 
thinks its a Goddamn crime.
The students are certainly not 
in a position to bring about such 
an observance and would not have 
the motivation, since most of us 
didnt know the young man. But 
know him or not, there are surely 
many who would have wished to 
formally recognize, and have a 
formal occasion to meditate on 
the reasons for, his death.
I know there were little signs 
posted here and there about a
I personally have given more 
energy to campus causes than I 
can afford, and have found that 
students usually take their cues 
for concern more from the Big 
Boys than from just any fellow 
student and I am therefore 
convinced that unless the Uni
versity acts responsibly in such 
circumstances, even the death in 
ones own backyard will be 
received as just another blip on 
the old CRT-less, even, because it 
has nothing directly to do with 
bucks.
Dean Swank is guilty of a more 
serious lapse by leaving it to the 
Coroners office to inform the 
parents, then, no doubt at the 
limits of his imagination, blaming
religious service, but 10:30 on a the Coroners office for bungling,

Study Finds Students Shy
PITTSBURGH, PA. (CPS)-Lots of college 
students feel compelled to look like theyre 
comfortable in social situations, while to

But a recent study at the University of

from being alone. Paul Pilkonis, an ap

to subsequent psychological testing, actual

Spring Brings 
Clashy Fashions
by Cathy Fischer
Come spring, we'll all be needing sun
glasses. I don't know if the weather is go
ing to be blazing hot, but the spring clothes 
certainly will be. Fushia, bright purple, 
stoplight yellow and red, grass green, and 
various bold shades of blue are popular 
colors this spring.
If you're color blind, you might consid
er yourself lucky. This spring, the more 
clash, the better. For instance, fashion de
signer Giorgio Sant' Angelo has designed a 
jacket made of red chiffon, with green trim 
where the cuffs should be, purple trim 
where the lapel should be and no buttons 
where the buttons should be.
The fashions are what the clothing in
dustry calls "unconstructed." Everything's 
very loose and many of the clothes tie on, 
pull on, or wrap around. Consequently,

site sex, the researcher discovered they 
were quicker than shy people in initiating 
conversations, and that thoy typically did 
most of the talking once the conversation 
got going.
Yet shy people didnt differ from the 
outgoing when the average length of each 
utterance was measured.
Both shy and not-shy groups performed 
as well when asked to deliver a speech us
ing prepared material. Shy people were, its 
true, more anxious while giving their 
speeches, but their overall performance 
scores were the same as the outgoing peo
ple.
Pilkonis thus concluded that shy people 
are only shy when there is no clear defini~tion of the most appropriate or desirable 
behavior in a given social situation.

Contraceptive is Questioned
by Helen Cordes
The most talked about contra
ceptive since the pill, announced inchhigh headlines in ads running last month in 
over 100 college papers.
The makers of the new contraceptive 
Encare Oval couldnt have been more cor
rect. Encare Oval is a suppository-type 
product that, when inserted in the vagina 
before intercourse, melts to provide chemi
cal and physical barriers to sperm, the ads 
say. People have been talking about Encare 
since its U.S. marketing began in October 
of 1977. And theyre still talking now that 
Encare has become the nations fastestselling over-the-counter contraceptive.
But while many cite Encares
over other methods of contraception - it 
has none of the dangerous side-effects at
tributed to the pill and the intrauterine de
vices (IUDs), and less of the messiness and 
inconvenience of most foams and jellies  
others are telling a different story.
Despite the advantages, says the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), and, 
more recently, several disgruntled college 
family planning centers, Encare may not 
provide the extremely high sperm-killing 
protection the ads promise.
Furthermore, they say, although Encare 
originally claimed effectiveness rivaling the 
pill and IUDs, it has not been proven 
any more effective than present foams and 
jellies, which have one of the lowest actual 
failure rates of all contraceptives.
This warning was reiterated in the Sep
tember, 1978 issue of the FDA Consumer. 
Encare users, the report says, can expect an 
effectiveness range of that for nonprescrip
tion foams and gels, which range from 71 
to 98 percent. The percentages vary be
cause of substantial variations in the care 
with which women follow directions for
use. Encares viscous barrier claim, the 
FDA says, is weak.
Eaton-Merz, meanwhile, says that the 
FDAs conclusions are based on no real 
proof, either, and that consumers like En
care. Kathleen Breen of Encares public re-Q 
lations firm, Herbert Farber Associates, 
said their survey of 600 users found 86 
percent were satisfied, and quite a lot of 
them said they would buy the product 
again.
Breen added that while the company 
hadnt received reports of unexpected 
pregnancies while using Encare, they were O 
hearing of irritation to the vagina or the 
penis, a problem their advertising says may 
happen to a limited number of users. 
Also, Breen said, some women were repor
ting messiness at the end of intercourse, 
but she said there will be some messiness 
with these kinds of vaginal contraceptives.
Surveys of physicians and pharmacists, 
Breen pointed out, indicated widespread 
recommendation of the product. She cited 
an American Druggist survey of indepen
dent and chain store druggists that reporQ 
ted that almost half of the druggists were 
recommending it over 16 other products. 
And an Eaton-Merz survey found a large 
percentage of doctors recommended En 
care, Breen said.
While exact effectiveness data remain 
nebulous at this time, many campus birth 
control centers, including Planned Parent
hood Centers, are recommending that En
care be used with a condom, and some are 
are suggesting the insertion of an additional 
suppository after ejaculation.

U. of Florida Frats Raid Jewish Frat
When headlines about an alleged antiSemitic raid on a predominantly Jewish 
fraternity splayed across U. of Florida 
newspapers, few guessed that something 
constructive could come of the situation.
Members of Tau Epsilon Phi had charg
ed that 200 frat members attacked their 
house chanting such epithets as Hitler was 
right and Your mother was bright, but 
she was a lampshade. Fraternity shrubs 
and fence posts were uprooted, while eggs 
and paint were splattered against the 
house.
Although the National Council of Chris
tians and Jews called for the expulsion of 
any frats found guilty of participating in 
the raid, the UF Interfraternity Council 
Judicial Committee found the two accused 
frats innocent as groups of the alleged 
anti-Semitic attack. The committee, how
ever, put the two accused fraternities on 
social probation for 90 days because of
"provocative and unfraternal-like con
duct.
Since then one fraternity has apologized 
to TEP members. The other has appealed 
the ruling.
,UF President Robert Marston recently 
issued a statement declaring that there was 
indeed an anti-Semitic element to the raid. 
Moreover, he has set into motion a plan for 
educating UF students against prejudice. 
The plan includes the following:
1) Curriculum developers are to meet 
with the Anti-Defamation League to dis
cuss ways to beef up UF curriculum where 
it relates to anti-Semitism and prejudice;
2) A dialog on prejudice is to be opened 
at a monthly invitational dinner for a 
group of UF student leaders, faculty and 
administrators;
3) That dialog will be continued on the 
campus radio station to expand the dis
cussion to the community;
4) Residence hall advisers and student 
group leaders are requested to attend a 
seminar on the negative effects of preju
dice.
The president says, Were going to have 
incidents occur. Its how you respond to 
them that counts.
"Swap Dance" Was Best
A fratemity-inmate swap dance bet
ween Vanderbilt University ATOs and the 
Tennessee Womens Prison turned out to 
be the best dance we ever had, according
to a fraternity organizer. The 30 men also 
found the odds in their favor when 90 hos
tesses greeted them in the prison cafeteria.
Music Helps Test-taking
(CPS)If you want to do well on a test, 
maybe you should take it while listening to 
music.
Dr. B. Everard Blanchard of Chicagos 
DePaul University says that students who 
listen to music while filling out their test 
books generally are less anxious and get 
higher grades than those who dont have 
music in their classrooms.
According to Zodiac News Service,
Blanchard divided 254 DePaul students 
with similar academic skills into three 
groups. He gave them all an exam, but had 
one group labor in silence while another 
group listened to classical music, and a 
third group heard rock music.
The two groups listening to music, it 
turned out, had lower blood pressure and 
pulse rates during the test than the stu
dents who didnt hear music. They also 
ended up with higher grades on the test.
Fossil Fuel Research Funded
WASH., D.C. (CPS)-With an announce
ment that it was distributing $4.5 million 
in grants to American colleges, the federal 
government has finally begun to fulfill its 
pledge to get academia more involved in 
domestic energy research. The moneyto 
be split among 55 schoolsis generally for 
research into fossil fuels. A spokesman for 
the U.S. Office of Education (OE), which 
administered the grants, says there is no 
similar program for solar energy research.
The money, according to the OE, will 
go to support college programs in oil 
shale, uranium, gas, coal, and other land 
fossil fuels. It will, moreover, be distri
buted as fellowships to some 500 graduate 
students during this academic year. A small 
group of the students may be eligible for 
two-year fellowships. Most, though, will 
receive a S3900 stipend over 12 months, 
with the same amount going as a bonus 
to the schools.
About SI.8 million of the monies is 
going to campuses in the. western and 
south-western states. The reasons are both 
geological and political. In geological 
terms, most domestic fossil fuel deposits
are in the Sun Belt States. Politically, the 
OE explained, the grants are appeasements 
to politicians in those states, which often 
complain they dont get their full share of 
federal education monies. Thus, the uni
versities of Idaho and Arizona, the Colo
rado School of Mines, Montana College of 
Mineral Science and Technology, the Uni
versity of Wyoming are the biggest benefi
ciaries of the federal energy grants.

Almost 30 years separate our victories. Years that brought major advances in the treatment of cancer. When I was fighting for my life, Tracys chances wouldnt have been good. Then most people with Hodgkins disease, people like Tracy, died within 5 years.

While rumors circulate that Who mem
bers are getting tired of making music, they 
dont appear to be tired of making movies. 
After Quadraphenia, the Who plans a 
science fiction movie based on their album 
Whos Next.
Roger Daltrey also plans another 
screen appearance in a movie version 
of the book Me Vicar, in which he plays a 
contempory English robber who stages a 
sensational breakout from a maximum 
security prison. (The real-life con is now a 
parolee studying for a masters degree at 
Sheffield University in England.)

reports Curbishly, whos also co-producer.
CORRECTION
In last weeks article on the Gregory/ 
Lane lecture we mistakenly phrased Dr. 
Lanes portion as a dryer, bad factual 
discussion. It should have read dryer 
and factual discussion. The TARTAN 
apologizes for this mistake.
Public exhibition will start next summer, 
after a debut at the Cannes Film Festival.
Quadraphenia, incidentally, is a noun 
meaning an advanced state of schizo
phrenia. The movie, according to press 
reports, will portray the violent ModRocker youth conflicts of mid-sixties 
England.

A Look at the Oscars
by Frederic J. Siegel
Although winning an Oscar doesnt 
consistute feelings of grandeur or mystique 
like it once had, the Academy Awards, 
given out each year for excellence in film, 
is still referred to as Hollywoods most 
heralded event. It remains the one night of 
the year when America gets to goggle at 
Hollywoods finest as they join together 
for an evening of suspense, long speeches, 
and for a few lucky people, the dream of 
a lifetime.
With nominations for acting, writing, 
directing and best picture, for his delight
ful comedy, Heaven Can Wait, Warren 
Beatty should have quite an exciting even
ing. With nine nominations total, Heaven 
Can Wait, joined two sober Vietnam War 
movies, The Deer Hunter, (eight nomina
tions) and Coming Home (eight) at the 
top of the Academy field. Heaven Can 
Wait and The Deer Hunter received cat
egories of best picture, direction, and act
ing. Joining the previous three for best 
picture are Midnight Espress, an out
standing film on the life of a young Ameri
can narcotics smuggler trapped in a brutal 
Turkish prison, and An Unmarried Woman, 
which stars Jill Clayburgh as a women try
ing to start life again after her husband 
walks out. Of all these films, Beattys 
Heaven Can Wait is most likely to walk 
off with best picture. The reason being 
that the other films are either too con
troversial or too subjective in content.
Heaven Can Wait succeeds where the other 
nominees fail. It is a brilliant picture with 
a tremendous range of audience appeal.
For best actor, the nominees were 
Beatty for Heaven Can Wait, Laurence 
Olivier, for his role as the aging Nazi 
hunter in Boys from Brazil, Gary Busey, 
for his portrayal of late rock singer, Bud
dy Holly, in The Buddy Holly Story, 
Robert De Niro as a steelworker who. 
survives a stint in Vietnam in The Deer 
Hunter and Jon Voight as the paraplegic 
Vietnam veteran in Coming Home. While 
Olivier would be the sentimental favorite 
to win this award, it is doubtful as to 
whether his performance merits real atten
tion for best actor. Gary Busey, despite an 
outstanding performance, is too much a 
new comer to win his first time nominated. 
Therefore, see this award going to either 
Robert De Niro or Jon Voight fo^ best 
actor.
Nominees announced for best actress 
were Ingrid Bergman, who has won three 
Oscars and six previous nominations, as 
the mother in Ingmar Bergmans examina
tion of the relationship between a mother 
and a daughter in Autumn Sonata. If she 
wins this year, which is doubtful, she will 
become the only person to hold four 
Oscars for acting. Another previous winner 
of an Oscar for best actress who was nom
inated for her role in Same Time, Next 
Year, is Ellen Burstyn. Playing a women 
who indulges in an adulterous affair one 
weekend each year for 25 years, she will
face competition from Jane Fonda who 
plays a young Army wife in Coming Home. 
Jane previously won best actress in 1971 
for Klute, and received a nomination last 
year for her role in Julia. It remains doubt
ful however, as to whether fcny of these 
oldtimers can beat out Geraldine Page, 
nominated for her role as a suicidal wife 
in Interiors, or Jill Clayburgh, for An 
Unmarried Women. Most likely, Jill Clay
burgh will walk off with best actress for 
her most powerful role in years.
For best director this year, the nominees were Hal Ashby (Coming Home), Warren 
Beatty and Buck Henry {Heaven Can Wait), 
Michael Cimino {The Deer Hunter), Alan 
Parker {Midnight Express), and Woody 
Allen {Interiors). Although he will face 
competition from Parder, Michael Cimino 
should win the Oscar for best director.
The race for best supporting actor in
cludes Bruce Dern for his portrayal of 
Jane Fondas crude Army-Captain hus
band in Coming Home, Richard Farns
worth as a ranch hand in Comes a Horse
man, John Hurt as an inmate in the turkish 
prison displayed in Midnight Express, 
Christopher Walken for The Deer Hunter, 
and Jack Warden as Warren Beattys 
trainer in Heanen Can Wait. Unless hes 
upset by Walken, Bruce Dern should cap
ture an Oscar for his greatest role yet in 
Coming Home.
The nominees for best supporting act
ress include Maggie Smith, nominated, 
ironically, for her role as an Academy nom
inee in California Suite, Maureen Stapleton 
for Interiors, Dyan Cannon, as the hyster
ically murderous wife in Heaven Can Wait, 
Penelope Milford, as the sister of a suicidal 
Vietnam veteran in Coming Home, and 
Meryl Streep as the sensitive girl left be
hind in The Deer Hunter. Meryl Streep, 
who is best remembered for her powerful 
role in last years NBC presentation of 
Holocaust, should take this award. It
seems clear that she will soon become one ot the screen s most important new
stars.
Although actor Brad Davis {Midnight 
Express), director Paul Mazursky (An Un
married Woman) and film Days of Heaven 
did not receive any major nominations, the 
academy did somewhat succeed in choos
ing worthy nominees. While it would be 
nice for Oscar night to return to its pre
vious grandeur, lets hope that this year 
the Academy Awards are not turned into 
the political debacle that it has been in the 
past. It was only last year that the crazed 
winner of the best supporting actress 
award, Vanessa Redgrave, misused her 
moment of triumph to voice her support 
for the terrorism of the Palestinian lib
eration Organization and condone what she 
termed as a dangerous Jewish element in 
the United States. We should keep clowns 
like her in the circus and make a new 
attempt at keeping this evening void of 
extremist political statements. Only then 
will Oscar night return to being the great 
evening that we all once remember.

Five CMU professors have received a 
grant for $238,000 from the American 
Institute for Research (AIR) to develop 
methods of simplifying the language used 
in contracts, leases, loan agreements, 
regulations, and other types of public 
documents.
The grant, part of the $1.4 million 
Document Design Project instituted by the 
Department of Health, Education and 
Welfare (HEW), and the National Institute 
of Education was awarded to Drs. Lee 
Gregg (Psychology), John R. Hayes (Psych
ology), Linda Flower (GSIA), Erwin 
Steinberg (English), and Richard Young 
(English).
These professors will work with teams 
from AIR and Siegel & Gale, a private 
firm that specializes in language simplif
ication and training. The project will 
focus on developing models of how people 
write, in particular, how document design
ers produce their materials; researching 
communication problems in public doc
uments; preparing programs to teach 
technically-oriented people, such as law
yers, doctors, and engineers, how to write 
technical public reports that can be easily 
understood; and developing undergraduate 
and graduate programs in document 
design.
The Document Design Project began in 
response to new state laws, such as the 
Sullivan Law in New York; a directive 
from Secretary Califano to HEW; and an 
Executive Order from President Carter 
directing all federal agencies to write 
their regulations in clear, understandable 
English.
Many public documents contain confus
ing instructions, needlessly complex sen
tences, poor organization, and legal lan
guage which the user cannot interpret. 
Many people lose money and time trying
to fill out forms, such as federal income 
tax or social security forms, because 
theyre trying to figure out instructions 
that even professionals cant always under
stand, commented one of the research 
assistants, Joyce Hannah. The purpose of 
this project is to develop guidelines to 
prevent that sort of thing.
Participants in the Document Design 
Project hope to come up with some strong 
recommendations about the legal language 
barrier. According to Dr. Hayes, Some 
lawyers say that it is simply impossible to 
translate legal terms into common English. 
But lawyers working with document design 
researchers have found that they can in
deed do exactly that. It takes a bit of 
effort, these lawyers say, but it can be 
done. 
The faculty members will be involved in 
researching the writing problems, as well 
as developing a graduate level program for 
people who write public documents. 
All of the researchers from CMU have been 
studying the writing process for several 
years and will apply many of their past 
findings to the particular problem of 
document design. By 1981 they hope to 
institute a graduate level interdisciplinary 
program for psychologists, linguists, and 
others interested in document design 
research, teaching, and consultation.
AIR and Siegel & Gale will study the 
problems that documents present to peo
ple, particularly the poor,, elderly, and 
those with a limited knowledge of English. 
They will also establish a Document Design 
Center to distribute textbooks, guidelines, 
manuals, job aids, and models to docu
ment writers, and provide training courses 
and consultations.
By the fall of 1979, the three groups 
will produce a preliminary set of guide
lines and a report of currently available 
literature and training.

All told, the planning for the Beaux Arts Ball 
has taken over a year. On March 13, 1978, the 
Beaux Arts Ball committee informed the five 
Department Heads, the Dean of Fine Arts, and 
the University central administration of our 
intention of resurrecting the Ball. Since that 
time extensive and meticulous planning (finances, 
entertainment, food and beverages, security, 
publicity, clean-up) has been pursued to ensure a 
night of delicious chaos.
THE BEAUX ARTS BALL COMMITTEE
L E T T E R S
Dear BABS,
Just dashing off this note to say I'm dashing to 
the ball  haven't been to a rumble in years. The 
last ball I went to was surrealist and there was a 
lady bathing in eyeballs, but what a lady! I 
thought that, as for the theme I'd come as my 
darker self and arrive as a Hell's Angel (Hows that 
for a dialectic?). Let's rock'em.
Yours,
Pete Granite

Dear Beaux Arts Ball Committee,
So the ball is back in town. I'll be the first at 
the door. Many are the splendid memories I savor 
from the Beaux Arts Balls past, but the cream of 
the crop, the piece de Russe as it were, for me 
was the Russian Ball. The candles of our winter 
palace blazed forth as we dined on blini and 
samovars in the shadow of the Kremlin. Caval
cades of Cossacs wielding saber and sables ra
vished women of the court, while I, cleverly 
disguised as Rasputin declaimed the virtues of 
the proles while overpowering anemic women. 
Bearskins and bobsleds, concubines and caviar, 
vodka toddies and hot pseudo-sturgeon on tap. 
At the height of the night I joined a team on a 
dogsled and we galloped through the halls on the 
heels (or hooves) of Catherine the Great's horse. 
By the gates of the Kiev, I swear the Carnegie tun
dra never saw a more Bolshoi evening!
So this year's theme is Black and White? I'm 
coming in ermine 
Yours Truly,
John Mackinson '57 
Washington D.C.
A theme for the ball was of course de reguer" 
with historical motives, such as Aztec or Incan, 
already popular. Costumes were often very "ad - 
hoc". Henry Matisse, one of the few truly great 
painters the L'Ecole ever produced, once descr
ibed his costume for the ball; 'The Bal des 
Beaux Arts was the one time in my life when I 
possessed was my bed sheet, draped around me 
like a burnoose, a red cord tied around my head, 
and burnt cork outlining my eyes. I've never 
forgottened the smell of that burning cork..."
HENRY HORNBOSTEL, architect and first 
dean of the College of Fine Arts, brought the 
Ball to Carnegie Tech. in 1915. Henry recieved 
his education at L'Ecole des Beaux Arts and 
evidently found his yearly revel to be well worth 
repeating in Pittsburgh.
And so it was. Each year excelled the one before 
in enthusiasm and pursuit of decadence, as ail 
history and culture were plundered in search of 
exotic settings: Ancient China and Babylon, Sur
realism and Polynesia. There were Kapers at 
Karnak and even A Evening on Mars. Costumes 
for the ball have been both transparent and 
opaque. Inthe '57 Ball the band, Jerry Wilson 
and the Swingers, showed up in transparent 
raincoats. In 1942, the theme was Chinese and 
the guest who came as the head of a dragon had a 
a costume 5 feet wide and 8 feet high..
Black and White is this year's theme, and 
liberal interpretation of the theme is definitely 
encouraged. Dress a dialectic or duplicate a 
dichotmynpair up as opposites or come as your 
alter ego. You can even come in black and white. 
(Formal wear is the bottom line.) Costume judging 
will take place throughout the nijht with the 
winners announced at 3.00 AM in the main 
entrance hall.
The planned scale of this party is truly enor
mous, with 1,000 to 1,200 people expected the 
night of the Ball. 7500 alumni have been notified 
and invited. Invitations for some "s|>ecial guests" 
have been sent to President Carter and the Mayor 
of Pittsburgh. A special effort has been made to 
ensure a good turnout of the Faculty of Fine Arts 
(some of whom have been working on cos
tumes for months).
Tickets, unfortunately, due to tradition and 
the capacity of the C.F.A. Building are only 
available to alumni, Faculty, and students of the 
College of Fine Arts. Two tickets are available to 
each student at $10.00 each. Faculty and alumni 
tickets are $15.00 each and two tickets for 
$25.00 ($10.00 for each additional ticket). An 
interesting fact is that in 1922 tickets for the 
Beaux Arts Ball cost $16.00, while tuition was 
$100.00. If this proportion were maintained 
today, tickets would cost $400.00 apiece.
NOTE. Although tickets can only be sold to 
those in the College of Fine Arts, anyone pre 
senting a ticket at the front door on the night of 
the Ball will be admitted.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The College of Fine Arts is proud to announce 
that the BEAUX ARTS BALL will be re-inaugu
rated at 10:00 PM on Saturday, March 3, 1979. 
This is no ordinary Ball. Not to be confused with 
a Prom or Beer Blast; this extraordinary night is 
the latest in a long tradition of outlandish amuse
ment.
Originally the inspiration of L'Ecole Des Beaux 
Arts in Paris, the ball provided an ideal occasion 
for some spectacular "unwinding" at the end of 
the year. The school's students would take over 
the Rue Bonaparte for a setting and the party 
was unleashed, often for as much as two or three 
days.

February 27, 1979-TARTAN-Page 17
by Linda Kucan
Spectacle, revelry, and make-believe will trans
form the Fine Arts Building, and fantastical fig
ures will dance through its halls on March 3. Stu
dents in the College of Fine Arts have been plan
ning the Beaux Arts Ball for several months. It 
will be a night to remember.
They have an imposing tradition to uphold; 
one that began in 1915. The first ball was a mod
est affair compared to its successors. The Roman 
motif was expressed by the classical columns in 
the Fine Arts Building and the costumes were 
simple togas and robes.
In the years that followed, there were more 
elaborate decorations and costumes. The Charle
magne Ball featured chandeliers suspended at in
tervals down the hallways. Candles produced a 
soft glow and the main entry in the lower foyer 
became a throne room with a backdrop of detail
ed facade. Dancing girls performed for the assem
bled court.
In 1922, CMU became Granada. The program 
notes evoke the atmosphere for that night in Feb
ruary: "Abab Abdallah ruled Granada when that 
kingdom was at its height ... and 'twas then that 
the Fiesta en Granada was a most glorious and 
magnificent display. The people demanded a per
petual spectacle. Life with them was a long carni
val ... a time of chivalric splendor and sentimental 
heroism/'
The next year's theme was a natural since Car
ter had just excavated the tomb of King Tutank
hamen. Kapers at Karnak was described in the 
1923 Thistle: "... we walked down a long beauti
fully decorated and ornamented hall. Sweet mu
sic was playing, we danced and behold, a mir
acle  Old Egypt brought back to life. At eleventhirty runners announced that King Tutankhamen 
wished to address us. Silence reigned while the 
Royal Procession passed down the long corridor. 
Tall muscular slaves surrounded the King ... he led 
the way to an adjoining chamber where a wonder
ful picture of Cleo's court was given by the King's 
Entertainers. Cleo, after feeding prisoner after 
prisoner to the Royal alligators, closed the 
court..."
The Ancient Chinese Ball featured leering Buddahs and long pigtails. The Thistle writer com 
mented: " There is something undefinably bar
baric about the Arts Ball. The period is always 
chosen in some outlandish country, and the deco
rations seem but to furnish a background for the 
general feeling. ' There is nothing beyond; to
night we will live, tomorrow we die and are gone; 
it is Kismet, let us dance. ' Such is the spirit. The 
general abandon, the air of irresponsibility to 
anything, the somber hangings, the gorgeous cost
umes, all tend toward a vivid, lasting impresr
The balls became increasingly spectacular and 
each year's committee tried to outdo the splendor 
of the last. There was One Arabian Night in 1925. 
The program reads: "... there was not in all of 
Scheherazade's storytelling a night to be com
pared with this, the One Arabian Night, as it will 
be told by every pair of flashing eyes in the scin
tillating, laughter-mad throng that will crowd the 
enchanted halls of this palace of our dreams." 
There was incense and oriental rugs, a chorus, and 
dancing girls. " Nine beautiful girls arrayed in 
marvelous costumes of pearl and rose, favored the 
audience with a dance easily described as the ful
fillment of a Ziegfield dream."
There was The Kingdom of Fable, An Evening 
on Mars, and A Voyage of Sinbad. The Mayan 
Ball was attended by alumni, faculty and students 
covered with dark sun tan body paint stocked by 
the campus store. A huge feathered serpent hung 
over the Director's office, and the theatre walls 
were covered by a brightly colored mural of hie
roglyphics. There was a ceremonial dance and sac
rifice while the audience chanted to the beat of 
tom-toms.
Sooner or later, these extravaganzas had to 
reach a plateau. The funds needed to produce the 
elaborate decorations and to provide the enter
tainment were not being furnished by ticket sales, 
and the balls became less frequent. The Surrealist 
Ball of 1946 was the first to be held after an 
interval of eight years.
The TARTAN headline, read: " Surrealistic 
Caterpillar Awarded Costume Prize at '46 Beaux 
Arts Ball." Six design students with painted legs, 
stocking-covered faces, and willow branch anten
nae were only one example of that year's unusual 
guests. Second prize went to two girls who came 
as a split personality. "The huge head was split 
and each girl wore half. With their identical cos
tumes and green faces they could have come from 
Dali."
Once again the Fine Arts Building was totally 
transformed. "A mural depicting two huge heads 
covered the whole left wall ... Outside on the 
steps sat a lady taking a bath amidst egg shells 
painted like eyeballs. Some of the statues in the 
foyer sprouted new additions such as horses' 
heads. The lighting was very effective. The pre
dominating color was red. In a niche was an eye
ball being roasted ..."
The 1948 Beaux Arts Ball was the subject of a 
feature article in the March 29 edition of Life 
magazine. There were pictures of the 20-foot sta
tue of Buddah and of the various costumes, which 
included one student who came as a tree. The Bal
inese Ball recreated the atmosphere of a tropical 
isle. " Two girls who were overzealous in design
ing their skimpy Balinese costumes had to be sent 
home by the dean of women."
The committee for the 1979 Beaux Arts Ball 
is making arrangements for an event that promises 
to uphold the fantastic tradition. The theme will 
be carried out in black and white and costumes 
should be designed to reflect the idea of oppo
sites. There will be cabarets offering a variety of 
musical and dramatic acts presented by faculty 
and students. The concert hall will have disco 
bands; there will be opportunities for easy listen
ing in the Faculty Lounge, and wandering min
strels and mimes will be encountered in the halls. 
The activities will begin at 10:00 PM on March 3, 
and will end at 6:00 AM. There will be a break
fast served at 3:00.
Alumni, faculty, and students of the College 
of Fine Arts can look forward to a night of fan
tasy, magic, and surprises. Judging from the past, 
they should come ready for anything.

ENTERTAINMENT
Sha Na Na suffers from success, not age
Beaux Arts Ball another old Tech tradition
by Joan Livitski
The secret must have gotten out about 
Beaux Arts Ball for the initially slow ticket 
sales, which rumoredly threatened the Ball 
with cancellation, picked up on the last 
day of sales. In fact, sales not only increas
ed, but according to Dan Garber, one of 
the chairpeople of the event, theyve closed 
public ticket sales after slightly over 1,200 
tickets were bought.
Dan had two reasons why he thought that 
ticket sales got off to a slow start. One was 
that people just didnt know about the Ball 
and the other, and more likely reason, was 
that people didnt understand what the 
Ball is all about. They thought either its 
a prom or a beer blast. Jean Becker, another chairperson for the Ball, added 
that she thought people just didnt have 
the money.
Ten dollars is a tidy sum for the students 
to come up with for one ticket. But when 
you consider that it includes a champagne 
breakfast, all the beer you can drink, and 
non-stop entertainment from 10 PM until 
6 AM, just try to find that anywhere in 
Pittsburgh for a comparable price. Besides, 
one gets to take part in another old Tech 
tradition, and hasnt that been what this 
year has been all about? Of course, the Ball
is only open to Fine Arts students, faculty 
and alumni, unless you were lucky enough 
to get invited as a guest. There is good 
reason for making this a closed party. As 
Dan puts it, its due to tradition as well 
as the population that can fit into Fine 
Arts that has made it a necessity to con
fine it to Fine Arts people.
All the planning and fund raising has been 
independent of the university and has been 
going on for well over a year. About 75 
people have worked on organizing the Ball 
with a core of about 15 or 20 according 
to Jean. Apparently, theyve been doing a 
good job at it. Dan felt the planning has 
convinced people that we know what were 
doing...it has impressed everyone in the ad
ministration and has allowed us to go on 
with this [the Ball].
The success of this years Ball may give 
support to plans of having the Ball next 
year, according to Dan, but he wouldnt 
advise it. Even in the past, the Ball wasnt 
held every year, but rather about every 
four years. Dan didnt feel there had been 
a class at the school that hadn't thought about holding the Ball (no pun intended), 
but that it was actaully happening now be
cause it was the right time and luck was 
running their way. The reason the tradition 
stopped was because it had got out of
hand, according to Jean. So, to avoid any 
trouble, $500 of security will be hired.
There will be a change from the tradition 
as far as entertainment is concerned. In the 
past, one band would play through the 
whole night. This year there will be such a 
wide variety of things going on that there is 
sure to be something to please everyone. 
Therell be jazz, folk, and disco music, ro
ving minstrels, drama skits, even a liquid 
crystal and lazer show in the Alumni Con
cert Hall. (For a more detailed account of 
whats happening and where, check Folio.)
Traditionally, there used to be a Beaux 
Arts Week. This had been a week long artis
tic celebration with art exhibits, architec
tural competitions, shows and skits by 
drama students, and demonstrations, all 
climaxed by the Ball.
One tradition theyre hoping will not 
change is the attention people will pay to 
their costumes. As Dan said, Were hop
ing the costumes will be as wild as they 
have been. Jean added that  people in 
Fine Arts are getting credit for their cos
tumes. An article in an old Thistle tells of 
drama students coming to the Ball nude, 
gilded gold and carrying torches. People are 
designing, making, searching antique stores, 
and doing just about everything possible in 
order to come up with the most outlandish
and original costumes. If its a nice night 
one couple is planning to come on horse
back. Faculty and administrators are being 
encouraged to come in costume as well.
At 3 AM there will be a contest for the 
best costume with an as of yet unannounc
ed prize given. Judges will be Special 
Guests and Alumni.
The event should get quite a bit of cover
age. Life magazine, who covered the Ball 
back in 1948, has been invited back along 
with Newsweek, Time and People. All the 
local media have been invited as well 
Evening Magazine may even bring their TV 
cameras. And of course the TARTAN will 
be there to give their coverage. Word hasnt 
come in as of this writing as to whether or 
not President Carter or Mayor Ca Uiguri will

they all began to sound alike. The main 
reason for the concert seemed to be that 
now kids could watch the group on T.V. 
and feel proud that they saw-Sha Na Na in 
real life .
The worst part of the show was when 
the group would momentarily reach their 
former level of excellence, and realize that 
the ' crowd could really care less about 
quality. As long as Bowser came out, 
flexed his muscles and told the crowd to 
shout Grease for Peace the kids were 
happy.
The group cannot blame the crowd for 
all of their problems. During many of the 
songs the performers seemed so bored and 
uninterested that I thought they might just 
stop the concert in the middle of a song 
and go back to their hotel rooms for some 
much needed sleep. Since there are eleven 
members of the group, often there would 
be two or three of the group talking quiet
ly on the side of the stage while the rest 
were performing. During one song I even 
saw the drummer talking to some of the c 
singers while he was still providing the 
backbeat for one of the songs.
The show opened with their theme song a 
Sha Na NafGet a Job). After running# 
through four minute versions of all the %Wother classic fifties songs like Tears on My 2 
Pillow, Splish Splash, Teen angel, the 
not very appreciated by the crowd even 
though they performed a tight, exciting set 
that showed the new style of music that 
should start off the eighties. The four man 
group comes from Europe but has a sound 
which probably will bring them some suc
cess in America. They performed songs off 
their debut album Mirror Star as well as 
some rock classics like Wild Thing. The 
group was entertaining not just because of 
their musical ability but also because they 
were having so much fun.They really didnt 
care that most of the audience didn't ap
prove of their music, clothes, and actions 
on stage. The Fabulous Poodles showed 
that they can play good hard rock and have 
a lot of fun at the same time. I would urge 
anyone who is interested to catch them at 
the Decade Club in Oakland on March 11. 
With a good crowd in front of them this 
group just might be fabulous.
the drummer, bassist and guitarist stayed 
on to give an excellent version of Johnny 
B. Goode. The lead guitar of Danny (only 
first names in this group) was easily the 
best part of the groups performance. After 
this song the group played a closing set 
which included a version of Buddy Hollys 
Rave on. For some reason the group 
changed the lyrics of the song to Oh Boy 
instead of Rave On, every other lyric was 
the same except for that substitution. The
The group closed the show with Love 
Potion No. 9 and came out for an encore 
of the groups theme song. The audience 
seemed satisfied and even the performers 
were happy. Everyone knew what to ex
pect and the show was just what everyone 
expected. What not many people expected 
or liked was the opening act.
The fabulous Poodles were obviously
by Ted Smits
Sha Na Na first gained fame with their 
performance at the Woodstock music fes
tival almost ten years ago. Their version of 
old fifties rock songs were often better 
than the original. Their vocal abilities, stage 
show, and high energy level placed them 
above numerous other bands who used the 
same material. Like the rest of the groups 
at Woodstock Sha Na Na has aged consid
erably. The group has suffered more from 
their success than from their age. About 
two years ago Sha Na Na began their own 
television show and the groups music 
never recovered. Instead of playing to con
cert halls full of rock n roll fans, Sha Na 
Na now attracts a much more sedate and 
more easily satisfied audience. The crowd 
at Sha Na Nas concert last Friday night 
was a main cause of the groups poor per
formance.
The audience was made up of young 
children (15 and under) and their parents 
(30 and over). With this kind of audience 
it is hard to blame the group for giving out 
a dull, simple rendering of the songs that 
everyone was their to see. As soon as the 
audience recognized the name of the songs 
they let out a scream of recognition and 
then settled back into their seats for the 
next song. No one song gathered more

by Joan Livitski
Movement: an Extravaganza of the Arts 
is an event that by its name would most 
likely make one think of dance or ballet. In 
this case, however, it refers to an artistic 
demonstration of the martial arts. The 
Extravaganza moves the arts from the gym 
floor to the stage combining all the various 
forms. Each of the martial arts will be 
performed to music with the development 
depicted through fighting, dance and exer
cise.
If youre under the impression that all 
the martial arts can be summed up in one 
Bruce Lee film, you will be greatly sur
prised at the diversity and complexity of 
the show. To enhance the show and inform 
the audience, a narrator will explain the
history, purpose, and essence of the arts.
Demonstrators will wear costumes na
tive to the country they are representing 
and authentic weapons will be used. The 
attention paid to the details of dress and 
weaponry will make this an event educa
tional in the culture of foreign lands as well 
as of the martial arts. The audience will be 
taken from the jungles of Africa to the 
Orient with many stops between.
Not only is The Extravaganza represen
tative of many nations, but all races; and 
both sexes will participate in the demon
strations. Performers will also range in age 
showing that these art forms are not just 
for the very young. Though each partici
pant has his or her specialty, there is a 
common factor in their dedication and reMichelle Fabec and Cameron Leslie demonstrate defense techniques.
spect that each has for all the art forms as 
a whole.
Some special features of the show will 
include a fire dance, African dances, Coperia Moves expressed in dance and fight
ing, stick fighting techniques used in the 
West Indies, and Chinese Animal Forms.
Curtis Smith, a former Pitt football 
player, co-ordinated the show as part of 
his attempt to change the image of the arts. 
Therefore, he designed the show to enter
tain and educate by combining the arts 
with dance and music. Malingi Telefano 
will perform the fire dance where he will 
twirl bladed knives set ablaze. Ruriko Masutani will completely dispell any thoughts 
that females are all helpless creatures with 
her demonstration of the unbendable arm 
tactic. Other participants will show break
ing techniques, aikedo, and weaponry 
skills.
Music will be provided by an African 
drum group, Tijo-Tilu which means the 
joys of African dance and drumming. Their 
co-ordinator is Eric Rucker who is a mem
ber of the American Black Theatre Dance 
Ensemble. Other members of the Ensemble 
will also participate in The Extravaganza. 
They will be Malaya Rucker and Bill John
son. The attacking and falling will be done 
by stunt people, Bob Weinert, Bill Huston, 
Erskin Smith, and Ken Mannka. All are 
highly skillled in the art of jugitsu.
So whether youre a fan of the martial 
arts or just like exciting entertainment, 
Movement: an Extravaganza of the Arts is 
an event you should not miss.
The Extravaganza will be held March 6 
at 7 PM in the Soldiers and Sailors Memor
ial Hall. Admission is $2.

According to Mrs. Walter M. Ewing, the 
Pittsburgh Director of the Auditions, This 
is the first time since they were started in 
1954 that the regional auditions, sponsored 
by the Metropolitan Opera National Coun
cil, will be held in Pittsburgh. Having the 
Auditions here will give area music lovers 
the chance to hear some of the finest 
*^oung singers in the Great Lakes Region.
Each year, singers from the United 
States and Canada compete in the Met Au
ditions, beginning at the District level and 
continuing, through a process of elimina
tion, to Regional Auditions and to the 
Semi-Final Auditions held at the Metropol
itan Opera House in New York. The Great 
Lakes Region, one of 16, encompasses 
western Pennsylvania, northern Ohio, 
Michigan, western New York and eastern 
Canada, boasting many musically promi
nent cities including Pittsburgh. Between
10 and 13 winners will sing in the Great 
Lakes competition, including three from 
the Pittsburgh District Auditions, held on 
February 4 at CMU. Tenor James Beal and 
bass-baritone Paul Schmidt tied for first 
place; Ulises Espaillat, a tenor, took third 
place honors.
Judging the Auditions will be a panel of 
three, headed by the Met-appointed repre
sentative, Walter Taussig. Mr. Taussig is an 
Associate Conductor at the Metropolitan
Cash prizes will be awarded to three top 
winners; the first place winner will go on to 
compete with approximately 20 other re
gional winners in the National Semi-Finals. 
Ten or 12 of these singers will be chosen as 
National Finalists, all of whom will receive 
educational grants of $2,000 or more.
It is hoped that the Auditions will signi
ficantly increase opportunities for national 
and international singing careers. Many 
former Auditions winners have gone on to 
stardom, including Jerome Hines (who will 
sing the title role in Pittsburgh Operas Don 
Quichotte on March 29 and 31), Robert 
Merrill, Martina Arroyo, New Kensingtons 
Andrea Velis, the late Richard Tucker, 
Rosaline Elias, Regina Resnik, and many 
others.
Music lovers who cannot attend the Au
ditions in person will have the opportunity 
to hear them broadcast1 live over the Duquesne University National Public Radio 
station, WDUQ-FM (90.5). WDUQ radio 
coverage is provided through sponsorship
by Mellon Bank who will also extend cash 
prizes to match national prizes to the first, 
second and third place winners. The pro
gram will be hosted by Ray Lehman, who 
for 15 years was the commentator for the

 . . . the best interpreters of their own 
work, is how Samuel Hazo described the 
poets for the second half of the Poetry For
ums program. This is an accurate descrip
tion of writer/feminist Erica Jong. She is an 
accessible poet as she describes herself; 
people who dont understand poetry, under
stand hers.
The majority of her poems lack depth 
and vision. A common complaint about po
etry readings is that the poems go by too 
quickly; they are too deep and need time to 
be absorbed. This is not the case with Erica 
Jong. Most of her imagery was stale, the
metaphors predictable, and the diction flat, 
as in this line from Ordinary Miracles  . . . 
the odor of roses to a lovers nose ... Occa
sionally there are moments when she is able 
to mix her dull seriousness with humor, as in 
these few lines:
For I will consider my dog 
Pooch kin 
(& his long-lost brothers,
Chekarf & Dogstajevsy).
For he is the reincarnation of 
a great canine poet.
For he barks in meter, & 
when I leave him alone 
His yelps are 
epic.
She read one poem in particlar, though, 
which revealed a perceptive, probing quality 
the others lacked. This poem Onion, was 
from her first collection of poems, Fruits 
and Vegetables. Unlike her more recent 
work, this poem showed the sensitive nature 
of poetrythe peeling layers, green nearer 
the core, the heart of what a poem can be.
However Ms. Jongs approach is superficial. 
And here is her downfall both as a poet and 
a feminist. She discussed her philosophy be
hind the poems in the book, saying her in
tent was an exercise in writing honestly. Be
ing a housewife at the time, this meant that 
she had to write about the homely things 
which surrounded her, like potatoes and ba
nanas.
I usually come away from readings, not 
necessarily liking the poets personality, but 
thinking the poet was interesting, unique in 
some way. I came away from Erica Jongs 
reading thinking that she would make a nice
friend or relative, but wasnt particularly 
compelling or insightful as a poet. All in all, 
the material Ms. Jong read was more along 
the lines of entertainment. Certainly her 
poetry is appealing, but it is far from rewardin or enduring.

Having enjoyed Molieres works since 
my first reading of Don Juan, I was pleased 
to learn that The Pittsburgh Metropolitan 
Stage Company was presenting The Metro 
in Tartuffe, Molieres renowned comedy. 
Their production is very enjoyable and re
freshing-full of the vitality and excitement 
which Molieres plays deserve.
Moliere was a 17th century French play
wright/actor whose satires were written in 
a commedia dell arte stylerelying to an 
extent on improvisation, sight gags, and 
audience interaction.
Tartuffe is one of Molieres more well 
known plays. It is a farce about a religious 
hypocrite, Tartuffe, and his attempts to 
cheat Orgon, a homeowner and family 
man, of his wealth. Orgon is so taken in by 
Tartuffes feigned piety that he can think 
of nothing except Tartuffes saintliness. 
Orgons family however sees through Tar
tuffes disguise and plots against him. In 
the end, Orgon discovers Tartuffe trying to 
seduce his wife and realizes the fool he has 
been since he had given all his wealth to 
Tartuffe in an act of faith. Only a deus ex 
machina intervention from the king saves 
Orgon from bankruptcy and prison and im
prisons Tartuffe instead.
When the play was first presented in 
France, it met great opposition from vari
ous religious groups and was banned for 
over five years. The Tartuffe we have to
day is a revision of the original which was 
a cruder and more farcical version of only 
three acts.
The Metros production of Tartuffe Xs 
simple and directly in line with the spirit of 
the play. The cast works on a nearly bare 
stage with little props and costume and 
minimal lighting effects. Instead they rely 
on a good actor-audience relationship and

excitement and intimacy with the play 
which is essential for this kind of show to 
succeed.
The characters are very one dimensional 
(as they should be). Tartuffe (played by 
JP. Martin) is unmistakably the villain. He 
is hateful but comic in the extremes of his 
arrogance and the absurdity of his attempts 
at sensuality which he shields with virtuous 
maxims. Orgon (Jack Papais) is the perfect 
fool. He is completely blind to what his
and CMU student John Papais
eyes see and always harbors at one time or 
another. Other notable performances were 
given by Jodie Lynne McClintock as Elmire, Susan Chapek as Dorine, and Margar
et L. Bearmon as Marianne.
So bravo for The Metro; with Tar
tuffe, they have succeeded in producing 
their kind of theater. Performances will run 
through March 17 at the Lovelace Mario

Israeli dance company to give premier performance
The Bat-Dor Dance Company, Israels 
modem dance company, will make its 
first appearance in Pittsburgh at Heinz 
Hall on March 6 at 8 PM under the spon
sorship of the Pittsburgh Dance Council.
Founded by the Baroness Batsheva 
de Rothschild in 1968, the 26 member 
company has toured four continents in 
its first ten years. In 1967, Bat-Dor was 
the name of a group of dance studios in 
Tel Aviv. Today, the Bat-Dor Dance Com
pany which evolved from these studios 
is a modern company of international
standing with26 dancers and a wide rang
ing repertoire. Bat-Dors Artistic Direc
tor, Jeannette Ordman, has planned a 
wide range repertoire for their first tour 
of North America.
The program slated for Pittsburgh will 
include work done by Israels two leading 
choreographers, Mirali Sharon and Domy 
Reiter-Soffer, Britains Robert Cohan and 
American choreographer, Gene Hill 
Sagan. The program will include Hymn 
To Jerusalem, choreographed by Mirali 
Sharon, expresses the traditional imagery 
aroused by the symbol which is Jeru
salem. Sagans piece And After... is a 
work in memory of a dancer friend who 
served in the Golan Unit and was killed 
during the Yom Kippur War. Tzaikerk, 
choreographed by Robert Cohan, means 
twilight in Armenian conveys a movement 
of fluidity, space patterns, and lighting. 
Bat-Dor will perform their famous piece 
Journey as the final work on the program. 
This is the surrealistic journey of^ woman 
into her dreams.
Since its beginning, the Bat-Dor Dance 
Company has been directed by Jeannette 
Ordman who is also a principal dancer
with the company. At the age of 15 the 
legendary Anton Dolan on a visit to 
South Africa chose Miss Ordman to dance 
Giselle and invited her to join his dance 
compnay in London. On a visit to Israel in 
1964, Miss Ordman was asked by the 
Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild to start 
The Bat-Dor Studio from which the 
company evolved in 1968

New Book Gives Tips For Job Interviews
LEXINGTON, Mass.Many of the two mil
lion students who will graduate from the 
nations colleges and universities this year 
have already begun to search for jobs. 
Some will wait too long to start the process 
and some will have their career paths slow
ed by inadequate preparation for their en
try into the job market according to the 
authors of a new book on the subject.
Two employment professionals, John D. 
Erdlen and Donald H. Sweet, have pooled 
their experience to prepare a factual guide 
to job hunting. Their new handbook, Job 
Hunting for the College Graduate (D.C. 
Heath) was published this month.
The book presents a master plan for ob
taining the right job: presenting oneself ef
fectively on paper, obtaining interviews, 
optimizing interviews, evaluating job of
fers, and settling in on the new job. The 
book concludes with the answers to a list 
of job-hunting questions frequently asked 
by college students.
Some students will benefit from the 
convenience of on-campus interviews by re
cruiters from major companies. But the 
odds for success are long. Citing average 
experience, the authors observe that in or
der to hire 100 new graduates, a typical 
employer must conduct 3,300 campus in
terviews followed by 500 job site inter
views. To improve the probability of suc
cess and to increase the number of options, 
the authors urge job prospecting through a 
number of additional channels.
Sample letters and resumes are present
ed along with practical advice for each step 
along the way.
Among their tips for the interview, the 
authors urge the interviewee to remember 
four key points: 1.) Ask well-prepared 
specific questions that call for more than a 
yes or no answer. Instead of asking, Do 
you promote from within? say, I assume 
you promote from within; what is the 
normal selection procedure? 2.) Use time 
to your best advantage and keep the discus
sion job-related. 3.) Be honest. Never try 
to answer questions when you dont really 
know the answers. A simple, I dont 
know is perfectly acceptable. 4.) Con
clude the interview to your best advantage. 
Dont hesitate, when the time is right, to 
indicate that you have no more questions.
Erdlen and Sweet offer 20 questions 
that an interviewer can be expected to ask 
and suggest ten questions the candidate 
ought to be prepared to ask. Also included 
are 15 mistakes that trap many job seekers. 
Among these are specifying narrow geo
graphic restrictions, talking too muchor 
too little (on average, the candidate should 
do about 75 percent of the talking), plac
ing too much emphasis on starting salary or 
benefits, failing to ask pertinent questions
about the company, and displaying no 
sense of humor.
While many assume that the dollars of
fered to a successful candidate are arrived 
at capriciously, the authors present ex
amples of typical salary calculations. Using 
as a starting point an average figure for all 
graduates with a degree in a particular

Questions You Might Aak
There comes a time in an interview 
when it is your turn to ask questions. The 
good interviewer will generally ask if you 
have questions. The good interviewer will 
generally ask if you have any; if this does 
not happen, take the initiative and say you 
do. This is the time when your homework 
about the organization and your listening 
skills will pay dividends, because you will 
be able to formulate good questions. Your 
questions will be an indicator of your mo
tivations, objectives, goals, and interests. 
So dont be hesitant; ask your questions, 
and be sure they are meaningful by expres
sing job-related concerns and interests. 
Dont ask questions that are answered in 
the organizations brochure or other mater
ial. The following list should provide a 
point of departure as you formulate some 
ideas on what you would like to know 
about the organization the interviewer re
presents.
What would be a typical first assign
ment?
Which of your locations have the type 
of job I am looking for?
What type of orientation would I 
have? What type of training programs 
do you have?
What might I expect in terms of job 
progression in your organization?
How often would my performances be 
reviewed?
Would I have the opportunity to con
tinue my schooling?
Do you have any recent graduates
3.
4.
5.
7.
from here working for you?
8. Would my spouse have an opportunity 
to look the area over before I make a 
decision?
9. What would happen to me if the com
pany ran out of work in my area?
10. What percentage of supervisory posi
tions are filled from within the com
pany?
Candidates do many things that create a 
distinct impression on the recruiter. It is 
most important to avoid questions, an
swers, or actions that result in a negative 
impact. Some of the most common mis
takes made by the interviewee include:
1. Stating specific geographic restrictions.
2. Contradicting yourself in responses.
3. Placing an inordinate emphasis on sal
ary and benefits.
4. Talking too much or too little.
5. Overly justifying weaknesses or fail
ures.
6. Displaying no sense of humor.
7. Not asking pertinent questions about 
the organization or the job.
8. Submitting a sloppy data sheet or re
sume.
9. Expressing biases and prejudices.
10. Expecting too much too soon; giving 
the impression you cant wait to be 
boss.
11. Appearing too aggressive; too smug; 
know-it-all; or overbearing.
12. Displaying protected-class syndrome 
You should hire me because I am so 
and so or such and such.
13. Exhibiting no self-confidence.
14. Providing a poor academic record.
15. Lacking enthusiasm for the organiza
tion.

7979 Designated Year Of The Child
The year 1979 has been designated In
national Year of the Child (IYC) by the 
United Nations. The General Assembly, of 
the U.N. designated the United Nations In
ternational Childrens Emergency Fund 
(UNICEF) as the agency to lead in the 
planning internationally. IYC also coin
cides with the 50th anniversary of Child 
Health DayOctober 2nd, as well as the 
20th anniversary of the United Nations 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child. 
That declaration stated that children have 
a right to affection, love and understand
ing; to adequate nutrition and medical 
care ; to free education ; to full opportunity 
for play and recreation; to a name and na
tionality; to special care of the handicap
ped; to be among the first to receive re
lief in times of disaster; to learn to be a 
useful member of society and to develop 
individual abilities; to be brought up in a 
spirit of peace and universal brotherhood; 
to enjoy these rights, regardless of race, co
lor, sex, religion, national or social origin. 
In conjunction with this, the American Ac
ademy of Pediatrics has developed a pro
gram called Speak Up for Children to run 
for the next two years. President Carter has
created a National Commission on IYC79 
with Mrs. Andrew (Jean) Young as chair
person; Mrs. K. Leroy (Catherine) Irvis is 
state chairperson and Mrs. Daniel (Carol) 
Bergercity chairperson. The words of the 
Declaration of the Rights of the Child seem 
rather trite but this may be the time for all 
of us to read and think about them in more 
than just a passing vein. The Childrens 
Hospital of Pittsburgh has accepted the 
challenge of the IYC. Under the sponsor
ship of the Allegheny County Medical So
ciety, the Allegheny County Medical Soci
ety Foundation, the Pennsylvania Acad
emy of Pediatrics and the Pittsburgh Pedi
atric Society and the Board of Directors of 
Childrens Hospital of PittsburghRobert 
Dodds, President, Childrens Hospital of 
Pittsburgh has embarked on a program for 
children for the next two years. There are 
at present six committees actively planning 
programs related to Accidents, Nutrition, 
Immunizaion, Health Education, Infant 
Mortality and Love for the Child (the last 
to include problems of-abuse, foster care 
and exceptional children).
The thrust of activity of these groups 
will be two-fold. The first is to bring the
nature and scope of the childs problems in 
these areas to the attention of the public. 
This will be accomplished through the 
media, programs on television and radio 
and articles in the newspapers and local 
magazines. The second and more important 
thrust will be an action program related to 
each of the six designated problem areas:
1) AccidentsLegislative action in Harrisburgh regarding child safety regulations in 
automobiles; 2) NutritionFostering fuller 
utilization of the Womens, Infants and , 
Childrens (W.O.C.) nutrition program. Cur
rently only 20% of the eligible women and 
children use this service. 3) Immunization 
Having a catch up day in Allegheny 
Countyproposals for all children to be 
given free immunizations in clinics and doc
tors offices to catch up. At birth par
ents to be given a Passport of Health (an 
immunization card, plastic, wallet-size, a la 
charge card, more likely not to be lost). 4) 
Health Education Direct involvement of 
pediatrician and other child care givers in 
helping parents with anticipatory guidance 
regarding child development and helping 
schools conduct health education; 5) In
fant Mortality Education in the home and
the community regarding family planningdealing with causes of prematurity and low 
birth weight and subsequent high infant 
mortality; 6) Love of the childAddressing 
the problems of abuse, foster care and ex
ceptional children with emphasis again on 
family planning, understanding child de
velopment and active, timely intervention 
by involved agencies. In addition, there will 
be a program to ally our community with a 
developing nation to learn of their prob
lems in their areas and to offer our help. 
These are only some of the plans currently 
being considered by the respective commit
tees.
In the near future there will be an
nouncements regarding the programs to be 
offered locally. There will also be informa
tion from each committee regarding the la
test recommendations for proper nutrition, 
immunization and accident prevention.

SPORTS
CMU Leaps Over W&J; Lands Behind Gators
by P. G. Hoops
The CMU athletic community heard 
some good and some bad news last week
end. First, the good news: CMU nipped 
Washington & Jefferson by the score of 
70-68 on Saturday to raise thier Final con
ference record to 10-4. Now, the bad news: 
Allegheny downed Bethany by the score of 
77-69 to raise their Final conference record 
to 11-3 and capture the PAC crown. They 
will enter the NCAA Division III GREAT 
LAKES Region playoffs next Friday and 
Saturday at a site to be yet determined.
Mariano DeFilipo, who finished with 10 
pts., hit a 20 foot jumper at the buzzer to 
secure a win for the Tartans who finished 
the week at 1-1, dropping an earlier contest 
to this weeks pivot team, Bethany. Beth
any proved to be CMUs Waterloo as it was 
their loss to, and Alleghenys win over the 
Bisons that dictated who would be PACs 
champions.
Larry Hufnagel continued his scoring 
consistency, leading the Tartans with 20 
points, while Mike Pratt led W & Js scoring
with 20 points also. Dave Hofmeister 
played an outstanding game as he led both 
teams in rebounding and played hurt for 
most of the last 5 minutes of the ball game.
W & J led throughout most of the game 
and at halftime were ahead, 35-34. W&J 
stayed on top throughout most of the sec
ond half also, but could not withhold a 
CMU scoring barrage in the last 4 minutes, 
spurred on by Larry Hufnagel and Mariano 
DeFilipo. The rest of the game was truly a 
classic in CMU basketball history, even 
though the win could not improve their 
standing in the PAC.
Conference Notes: CMU finished second 
in the PAC followed by W & J and Bethany 
. . . Larry Hufnagel captured the mythical 
PAC scoring crown, finished 4th in re
bounding, and second in field goal percen
tage . .. Alleghenys Eric Lindberg finished 
first in rebounding . . . CMU finished first 
in the conference in total defense. Alle
gheny took offensive honors . . . Mariano 
DeFilipo finished third in the conference in 
total assists. ..Fencers Keep Busy
by R. (S.W.) McCague
During the last two weeks, CMU fencers 
have been very busy, and CMU fencing has 
been at times excellent, and, at other 
times, not up to par. Saturday, Feb. 10, 
the CMU fencers travelled to Case Western 
Reserve feeling perhaps a little too confi
dent. Their overconfidence hindered their 
performance as suddenly, and to its sur
prise CMU found itself only taking first 
place in the foil competition, and that win 
only because of Kevin Dowlings consis
tently superb fencing. However, events 
transpired much differently as Tech hosted 
a Novice and Intermediate Foil Competi
tion on the following day. In that compe
tition, Chris Scigliano, a new-comer with 
about two months of experience, took 
third in the novice fighting, no small feat 
considering his lack of experience.
While people were marvelling over Sciglianos finish, Jonny (eggman) McGraw and 
Mark (seagull) Segal took second and third 
respectively, in the intermediate combat 
against a rather tough field of fencers. This 
victory gave Carnegie-Mellon half of the 
mens medals won that day. Considering 
that half of the team was not fencing, and
that Kevin Dowling was one of those who 
did not participate, the feat was quite grati
fying to the team.
On Thursday, Feb. 15th, the team went 
up against Penn State  Fayette. At that 
meet, CMU cleaned up the opposition. The 
A team in mens foil went undefeated 
against Penn States A team, and unde
feated against their B team. This com
plete sweep made the A team, whose 
members are quiet Kevin Dowling, Jonny 
McGraw, Avram (space cadet) Scheiner, 
and Pete (U.P.) Bond, very happy indeed. 
The womens A team which consists of 
Julie (MOMS) Cohen, Pam Chase, and Dal
las Alice Tome, also won both of their ?matches. Moms Cohen also was undefeated 
for the days competition.
On Saturday, Feb. 17th, every one of 
the mens teams won, except for our C 
team, which lost to Penn States A team 
by a meager bout. The womens teams 
were undefeated. We would like to make 
the campus community aware that there is 
some quality fencing performed right here 
on campus, and that anyone who is inter
ested in participating or just watching 
should do so.

Physical Education at CMU Reorganized and Redefined
by Susan Bronder
This article is part of a series of reports 
written last year in an Expostion III class. 
A book of the collected reports, most 
dealing with some aspect of Camegie-Mellon, is available at the Reference Desk in 
the library.
This report is intended to dissuade the 
old ideas of gym class and promote the 
new objectives of physical education; to 
look at a few departmental problems; and 
to involve more people in the department 
and its activities.
If two people are having a conversation 
and one of them mentions physical educa
tion, there is a good chance that the other 
person will have bad memories of gym 
class. Smelly, sweaty socks, baggy gym uni
forms, the old matronly instuctors, and 
calisthenics are common elements from 
elemetary and high-school experiences. 
This bleak picture is also true for many 
colleges and universities, but at CarnegieMellon the physical education (P.E.) de
partment has been trying to change and 
eliminate the gym class for fifty years.
Since the early years of Carnegie Tech, 
the physical education department has 
been looking for a place in the education 
of students. During the early 1900s, P.E. 
was under the supervision of the athletic 
department. In 1940, the Department of 
Student Personnel and Welfare governed 
P.E. until 1967 when Carnegie Tech be
came Carnegie-Mellon University. Current
ly, the physical education department is a 
service department (allowing faculty and 
university employees as well as students 
to participate in classes), but is associated 
with the Dean of Student Affairs.
CMUs athletic department contains spe
cific departments which supervise varsity 
sports, intramurals, and physical education. 
James Banner is director of the athletic de
partment and acts as coordinator of the in
dividual departments but is mostly con
cerned with varsity sports. Earl Birdy, 
senior physical education director/intra
murals, and Raymond Haynes, head senior 
physical education director, report direct
ly to Mr. Banner. All instructors and Miss 
Jane Fisk, supervisor of womens athletics, 
report to Mr. Haynes. These people, plus 
administration and custodial employees, 
work hard during the school year to make 
physical education fun, enjoyable, and an 
integral part of a students total education.
CMU purports to be concerned with the 
education of the individual, providing an 
environment for scholarly study, research, 
and philosophical thinking. In 1968, the 
Education Policies Commission (now the 
Educational Affairs Committee of Faculty 
Senate) defined education as dissemina
tion of knowledge, the liberation of minds, 
the development of skill, the encourage
ment of creative or inventive spirit, and 
the establishment of wholesome attitudes 
towards change. Simply, education is 
more than being able to solve an equation 
or write a paragraph; it is the mental, 
social, emotional, and physical develop
ment of the individual.
Since the founding of Carnegie Tech in 
1900, now CMU, administrators have been 
aware of the students physical life and 
have always provided physical education. 
Wberating an individual is not confined to 
any one curricular discipline, and P.E. is 
another subject that a student can use to 
seek knowledge, skills, and understanding.
Knowledge gained in P.E. classes is un
derestimated by everyone  the traditional 
liberal arts specialists, the public, and the 
students. Thus, P.E. is not generally accep
ted as a discipline, as engineering, math, 
and history are. But P.E. permits the stu
dent to know his limits and abilities. At
tempting to meet unending challenges
guides a student to self-knowledge.
The value of skill is more readily ac
cepted, but people are still not fully aware 
that a P.E. course can contribute to 
liberating skills and imaginative thinking, 
hypothesising, experimenting and logical 
reasoning. P.E. activities also contribute 
to decision making processes needed for 
all types of human interactions.
A physical education class is a place 
where a student can begin to apply those 
principles taught in his other subjects. By 
participating in track and field, the biolo
gy student feels the ache as lactic acid 
builds up in his muscle tissues. To perform 
well in gymnastics and tumbling, an under
standing of gravity, momentum, and equi
librium is required. Racquetball provides 
the physics student with a model of par
ticle movement consisting of acceleration,' 
friction, and collisions. The class then be
comes more than a place to have fun and 
exercise, it becomes a laboratory where 
the student uses his surroundings for 
research.
Physical education changes with the 
times. The objectives of the program must 
continually be revised to meet new cultural 
patterns. In her annual report of womens 
P.E. (1945), Loise Russel, supervisor of 
womens athletics, said that physical edu
cation was a far cry from the program of
fered in the Twenties. Instead of calisthe
nics, sports were used to maintain the hu
man body, develop skills for worthy use of 
leisure time, develop a person socially, and 
contribute to physical and mental health. 
Since the late Sixties, the P.E. department 
has realized the possibility that their pro
grams may help to increase the number of 
years that students can enjoy physical ac
tivity by introducing them to good habits 
involving exercise, diet, rest, and recrea
tion. The early Seventies showed a trend 
toward the learning of new sport skills, a 
high expertise in lifetime sports (activities 
like handball, tennis, badminton, archery, 
and skiing that require one or two people 
to play), and individual programs. By the 
mid-Seventies, objectives turned toward 
imporovng strength and endurance, motor 
skills, and health practices. The department 
stressed a balance of team and individual 
sports.
Though there are some twenty activities 
offered each semester in P.E., all instruc
tors feel that each sport can contribute to 
a students understanding of him or herself. 
Currently, people are more concerned with 
their health. They jog and eat health foods. 
The P.E. class provides an opportunity for 
an individual to become more knowledge
able about his or her health, to become 
active in group experiences, to realize the 
joy of effort and achievement, and to have 
an understanding of sports and become a 
better spectator.
Lifetime sports is the new direction in 
physical education,, but CMU has been 
practicing it for ten years and will continue 
to expand in that direction. Once gradu
ated, a person will find that it is increasing
ly difficult to get a group of people togeth
er for a touch football or basketball game. 
But getting a buddy for a game at lunch
time or after work is much easier. And, if a 
person develops the skills in school, he will 
probably use those skills if he has the 
chance.

ences of opinion between administrators 
and P.E. faculty concerning P.E. class re
quirements, the physical education de
partment at CMU has gone through major 
changes. Until 1967, P.E. was required for 
freshmen and sophomores, and swimming 
was mandatory for at least one semester. In 
1967, P.E. became a non-credit elective. Mr 
Haynes wrote two proposition papers to 
validate the existance of the department 
and the P.E. class requirement. Administra
tors continued to support the non-credit 
elective, despite Mr. Hayness efforts. The 
P.E. department believed that those stu
dents who needed P.E. most were those 
students who were most reluctant to volun
tarily elect a P.E. class. Those people who 
did elect P.E. had extensive P.E. programs 
in high school and were experienced ath
letes. Since then, administrators have slow
ly made physical education more attractive 
by allowing the colleges to decide whether 
credit should be given or not. Physical educaters supported a required program using 
these arguments of defense: P.E. is educat
ion, it is the development of personality, 
it is more than exercise, it is a muscle buil
der, a circulation quickener. P.E. is athletic 
competition, teaching skills and sports ap
preciation.
Since credit has been established, attendence has been better, but it will never 
equal the numbers seen in the Fifties and 
Sixties. When more people attend class, the 
class becomes more comprehensive and 
functional because the instructor can 
teach his or her planned lesson without 
having to make allowances for inadequate 
nlimbers of people. When no credit is given 
for the class, students tend to skip class 
when the going gets rough, and the re
maining students lose too. Physical 
education is learning, applying, doing, 
and teaching, a cooperative effort.
Some people take P.E. to learn a sport. 
History and background are often presen
ted by an instructor as neat information 
to know, but the actual learning of the 
iport begins with basic skills and under
standing the rules and regulations. Drills, 
sometimes monotonous, are required, just 
as in physics and math, to master the 
subject. Once a person is prepared, a game 
can be played where a student can test his 
skills, learn sportsmanship and coopera
tion, learn about winning and losing, do
his best for a team, improve his skills, and 
be able to appreciate someone elses talent.
Many students are curious about a particual sport, so they sign up for it at pre
registration after seeing it listed in the 
course offerings. The department tries to 
make a variety of sports available each 
semester . Sports like fencing and skiing 
are sports of the times, exciting, dashing, 
and different. They draw people to the 
department.
A students whole day requires sitting, 
aid after such a day the body aches for 
activity, but many people dont have the 
incentive for a personal fitness program. By 
scheduling a P.E. class, a definite time 
during the week is automatically devoted 
to exercise. Some people just love sports. 
They like to be active, and a class allows 
them to make room in the academic day 
for the sport that they like.
A most tangible result of a P.E. activity 
is the contribution to neuro-muscular skills 
that, when directed toward recreational 
activities, provides temporary relief from 
worries and tensions. So, many students 
and faculty take a class to relax, to un
wind, and to forget about academic pres
sures.
Physical education at CMU is a dynamic 
program directing its objectives toward the 
needs of the student. It has survived since 
the founding of the institution in 1900 and 
remains an active part of student life be
cause students continue to participate and 
demand that the program continue. P.E. is 
not something to shy away from because it 
is unappealing or difficult. The program 
provides something for everyone. P.E. is 
learning sports that you can make use of 
throughout your life. It keeps you in 
shape. Its not gym class any more, not just 
calisthenics, and not something to be 
dreaded.

That's right. You get the haircut. 
But, we keep the hair. Unless, of 
course, you're stuffing pillows in 
your basement as a sideline. In 
which case, we'll put your shear
ings in a plain brown bag for you 
to take home.
Most guys and gals, however, are
mainly interested in the hair we 
leave uncut, because that's what 
says who they are.
At Great Ex we help get your 
head together. . .with your hair. 
No appointments needed either.
