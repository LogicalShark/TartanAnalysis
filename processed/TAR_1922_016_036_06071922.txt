SWIM. POOL SEPARATE
The past month has seen the crysallization of the different problems 
vhich have been confronted on the 
new gymnasium and good progress 
las been made towards a rapid com
pletion of the drawings, which are 
being carefully studied to present an 
ideal solution as conditions permit 
of the various units which are incor
porated in a gymnasium.
The upper floor of the building 
proper is utilized as the gymnasium 
floor, which will be 90 feet wide and 
200 feet long. At one end is a stage 
for accommodation of speakers, or
chestras, etc., for any entertainments 
which might be carried on throughout 
the school year. There is also a small 
gallery for spectators. The basketball 
floor will be placed lengthwise in the 
center of the floor, permitting the 
use of bleachers entirely around the 
court. In this way over 2,500 rooters 
can be handled. These bleachers are 
lowered through an opening in the 
front of the stage to a convenient 
storage area directly below the big 
floor. With the floor cleared there 
' is sufficient area to have five basket 
ball courts separated by detachable 
nets or the use of walls along the 
,side will give eleven one wall hand 
ball courts. There are ample entrance 
tairs at each corner of the floor.
The two floors beneath the large 
floor are divided between the men

T echnical Journal 
Staff Holds Banquet
Trinks Acts as Toastmaster; 
New Staff Announced
The second annual banquet of the 
Carnegie Technical Journal was held 
last Friday, June 2, from 6:30 to 
9:30 p. m. in the National Restaurant. 
Mr. Penske, departing manager, acted 
as toastmaster, and introduced the 
speakers, Prof. Trinks and Prof. 
Work, who are new faculty associates 
of the staff.
Prof. Trinks, in speaking of his 
experience with journals of a tech-' 
meal nature, stated that the Car
negie Technical Journal has a hard 
road to climb, but that in about ten 
years it will riot only be a success
ful publication, but a leader among 
its kind in this community. He ex
plained that the faculty would con
tribute more articles if the students 
would carry out the research neces
sary to prepare them.
Prof. Work, commented on the 
Journal in a similar manner, yet re
marked that if the publication must 
be a child for ten years, that it is 
certainly a very healthy infant at 
present.
Prof. Donnell, present faculty as'- 
sociate, was called upon, and dis
cussed the advance of the journal. 
Prof. Martin and Creech highly com
plimented the staff on the quality of 
the manuscript-turned in.
The new staff was announced with 
A. C. Carrao, manager; H. K. Burr, 
editor-in-chief; W. H. Horsch, tech
nical editor; F. H. Allison, business 
manager, and J. A. Morley, circula
tion manager.

Dr Yoakum, director of the Per
sonnel Research Bureau at Carnegie 
Tech is the managing editor of the 
new publication and in the first is
sue has contributed a comprehen
sive article on "Experiments in Vo
cational Guidance, in which he takes 
up the problem of advisable train
ing for vocations scientifically based 
on actual data obtained in the work 
of his department. To quote the 
conclusion of this article, It is a 
major problem in science to find for 
the individual his most favorable oc
cupation, that in which he is capa

Other contributions in the current 
issue are: Reasons and Plans for

Debating Association to Lose 
Only Two Men by Graduation
Tho last regular meeting of the 
Debating Association was held Thurs
day evening in the Y club room. 
Mattersof general debating inter
est were discussed and a plan for 
the continuation of intercollegiate 
debating at Carnegie was considered. 
Coach Peterson outlined the pros
pects for the coming year and felt 
that with the nucleus remaining 
from the present teams even greater 
success could be achieved next year. 
Officers for the next season elected 
were: President, K. J. Lawrence,
secretary, R. Shoerke; treasurer, J. 
Vana.
Carnegie will lose two varsity de
baters this year through graduation. 
J. Kenny, captain of this year's 
affirmative team, and L. J. White
head, captain of the . negative 
team and a member of the first team 
representing this institution. Al
though awarded third place in the 
pentangular league this year the 
team demonstrated that Carnegie is 
well able to take her place in the 
field of debating with other colleges 
and a successful season is looked 
for next year.

Surplus From Campus Week

STUDENT. TO GIVE RECITAL
FRIDAY EVENING, JUNE 9
COMMITTEE NAMED
With the last Campus Week and 
its success fresh in the minds of 
the student body, the question natu
rally ariseiWhat is done with the 
money that is made, if any? Last 
year there was a considerable bal
ance which was invested in a bond. 
This year there is a possibility of 
a like sum being realized. The mon
ey goes to the Student Council.
The Council, last year as well as 
this year, has put considerable time 
and thought on the disposition of 
this money. As a result of this 
work the 1921-22 Council at its final 
meeting proposed that a fund be 
started with this money and any 
other money accruing to the Coun
cil from similar activities. This fund 
is to be allowed to grow and accum
ulate until it is of such proportions 
that it can be used to successfully 
start a project for the erection of 
a real Carnegie Union similar to the 
Michigan Union and the common 
gathering place of students on other 
campuses. While any sums real
ized from these sources would bo 
insufficient far such a project, they 
would nevertheless be a big factor 
in creating interest and arousing 
alumni and students to support, it. 
The completed union would contain 
recreation rooms for men and wom
en, offices for the various activities, 
a large restaurant, bull room, and 
other features which would tend to 
blend the entire student body into a 
closer unit.
It is probable that in the courso 
of a couple of years a Carne
gie recognition pin authorized by the 
Student Council will be on sale on 
the campus. Purchase of this pin 
will give the purchaser a life mem
bership in the Union and the pro(Continued on Page Three.)

COLLEGIATE SIX
GIVE FREE DANCE TO
CARNEGIE STUDENTS
Last Friday night the Collegiate 
Six gave a dance, free to the stu
dents of Carnegie, in return for the 
supportgiven the orchestra during 
the school year. No use talking 
about the music; you all know how 
good it would be with them playing. 
There was a remarkably small crowd, 
considering that the dance was free, 
and this fact made the dance all the 
more enjoyable to those who were 
there This dance was the last ap
pearance of the Collegiate Six for 
the x current year, but Eve Hughes 
announced that the orchestra would 
be on hand next year to continue 
their good work.

May 31 His topic was "The Choos
ing of a Life Career.
Mr. Woods spoke of the vital ne
cessity that one choose the career 
for which one is best qualified and 
from which he will reap the great
est benefits. In the selection of 
ones life work, there are three ques
tions wliiAh must be satisfactorily 
answered to be successful in ones 
chosen field of activity: Is the work
;svortli doing and do you like to do 
it? Will the chosen work bring you 
honor? Will you secure from it ade
quate compensation, commensurate 
with the time and ability that you 
put into* it?
* Mr. Woods clearly and definitely 
pointed out, with the aid of charts, 
how vast a field life insurance is be
coming, how tremendous is its rate 
of growth, and how it is a perma
nent institution for which there is 
no substitute. As an indication of 
its potentialities, Mr. Woods stated 
that the total amount of
life insurance carried by the 
53,000,000 insured people of
the United gtates is $58,000,000,000 
a sum greater than the individual

Van and Shenk, Ziegfield Celebrities, 
Take Part in Fraternity Ball Game
At tho Assembly last week, awards 
were given to the girts who have 
earned fifty or seventy-five points,- 
Miss Breed talked about sportsman
ship, both in relation to athletics and 
other things. Miss Bov/man present
ed the pins to those who earned them.
Once upon a time there were a 
couple of honest to gosh singers who 
e the real . stuff. When they 
opened their mouths to sing the 
brown and 'green and pink and yellow 
birds up in the tree tops all quit try
ing, and twittered, You win, gents. 
Pick up the earthworms, But it 
came about that these aforesaid j 
singers, known throughout the length, 
breadth and thickness of tlie good old 
U. S. A. as the Ziegfield boys, upon 
reaching the Smoky Sooty, did crave 
to toss a ball hither and yon and hear i 
a loud-voiced man with a cage over | 
his face bellow Strike tub." So i 
thereupon they inserted an ad in a 
paper even better known than the 
Carnegie Tartan to this effect,1'.
And thats how it all came about 
that the famous team of Van and 
Schenk ate dinner on Thursday last 
at the Sigma Nu house, and pretended 
to like it. And -that's how it hap
pened that Van caught behind the 
plate for tho horfor und glory of Beta 
Theta Pi, while Schenk, lubored 
equally hard at first, to uphold tho 
standard of Sigma Nu. And darn 
good ball players they are. at that. 
No fumbles, no muffs, and no wild 
heave3 while the two famous harmonizers are on the job. As singers 
they certainly are doggone good ball 
players, which all goes to show that 
celebrities arent one-sided beings 
after all. Look at some of our Math 
profs!
And after the ball was overnot 
the fence, because there aint no sich 
animal, as the old lady said when 
the hippopotamus first met her gaze 
after the ball was over, as we were 
saying, tho party journeyed to the 
house of the Sigma Nils, And just 
by way of saying thank you Messrs. 
Van and iSchcnlc opened up on their 
repertoire that it would cost you four 
bits to hear at the Davis, if you left 
Lizzie at home. The word was 
swiftly passed around that famous 
men woro abroad, and in less time 
than it takes Obio Newman to comb 
his hair, tho Sigma Nu home wan 
jammed to the doors strange as this 
may seem. The concert was exceed
ingly enjoyed by everyone present 
which is saying a good deal.
All of which just goes to show 
that it doesnt pay to be merely.a 
specialist. Be determined to be 
well-rounded, and not one-sided. And 
determination will do it, you know. 
Whore theres a wdlltheres rela
tions, of course.

LAST ISSUE OF CARNEGIE TARTAN
'With this issue, tlie Carnegie Tartan will cease publication for 
1,liis school year. We have had a buccgWI'uI year, we believe. Next 
fall we will be on the job again. A new staff will have charge. 
The standards set by this years governing body will be maintained, 
if possible. We will endeavor to make our paper equal to any col
lege publication in the country.
OUR NEW ALUMNI
Bach year a larger class graduates :Fromi Carnegie. This lias 
been the condition since the first graduating class. A condition 
which soon will cease to exist, because oi; limited facilities and re
sources. Our expansion will be slower. However the quality of 
graduates will improve. Each year tlie curriculum is changed, so as 
to improve the courses. More subjects are added. Five-year courses 
are contemplated in some branches. The ultimate object is to turn 
out the best trained men and women possible.
Each year there is much regret to see the Seniors -leave. We 
can bul; feel the loss for a while. Next year another group takes 
their placo. The pathos of the situation is the severing of many 
friendships.
hJnch graduating class goes from school filled with promise, 
hope and ambition. The chances ol! a college graduate to become 
distinguished are great. However,' not all can bo successful. There 
will be many mediocrcs and some failures. Great or small; famous 
or unknown, upon leaving the school tho obligation to our Alma 
Mater does not eoase. We are indebted to tlie institution for the 
opportunity to loam; for associations onjoyod while hero. We must 
never loso sight of tho fact that, whatever we say about Carnegie 
Tech will bo what the public will think ol! our school. 'Wo must 
always liavo a good word for the faculty, students and friends.
We are proud ol our new alumni. Wo have confidence in them, 
and feel assured that they will uphold Carnegie at all times.
HAVE COURAGE, FAITH AND PLAN
Last Sunday's Pittsburgh Pross reports that Captain Roald 
Amundsen, the famous explorer, is leaving for the Arctic regions 
on a trip which will take soven years. The object being to study 
the weather; navigation possibilities, and to find any undiscovered 
land which nmy exist.
An undertaking of this extent takes courage, faith in ones sell' 
and confidence in ones followmen. This individual faith and cour
age is what is needed, in building skyscrapers, railroads and win
ning wars. To become a great; general, president, prize fighter or 
even a soap salesman one must possess those qualities,
Captain Amundson lives or plans for the future. Seven years is 
a long time to set aside from one's life for some special undertaking 
but any tiling that is really groat must be planned long iu advance. 
When coming to col logo a young man plans for four years in ad 
vauoo, After finishing school greater plans must bo laid. Unless a 
young man has some, definite aim, some set object to work for, far 
enough in the future so as not to arrive too soon, lie may go fast, 
but not far.
There are many opportunities hero at school, for training iu the 
art of accomplishment. Find a job in some activitygo after it with 
all your might, until you get what you want. Try for the big jobs 
and many smaller ones will be picked up on the way. Remembering 
that to be successful one must have courage, faith, confidence and a 
definite aim.
TALK UP CARNEGIE TECH
Students going home for the summer should not forget to boost 
Carnegie at every opportunity. Tell people back home what we are 
doing; what a wonderful school we have.
Get promising high school graduates interested. Tell them 
about our courses, athletics and other unusual advantages in coming 
to Pittsburgh.
Look up any alumni who may be living in your vicinity. Talk 
Campus Week. Get them to promise to return for the Notre, Dame 
game.
THE NEW CARNEGIE UNION
The Carnegie Union idea is good. It is proposed to use money 
acquired from Campus Week or other similar sources for a real Car
negie Union.
We need a place of this kind. We also need a commons. Either 
of these additions to the campus will be wclcome. Both will prob 
ably be combined.
The actual construction is distant, but we will no doubt realize 
it in time.

CRITICISM OF "KING JOHN
BY MR. HORNBOSTEL
The annivcraary of Shakespeares 
birthday was celebrated by the per
formance '(given by the Department of 
Drama of the Life and Death of 
King J'ohn, of the not well known 
and ao-caleld inferior pJaya.
The preaentation ah owed that the 
play ia not inferior to others of 
Shakespeare but a very interesting 
tragedy; that certain paaaagcs are 
full of beauty and subtlety, especially 
those recited by the bastard son of 
King Richard about commodity which 
from a modern point of view may be 
nterpreted as, the bad results of lucre 
and the desire of everybody to have 
it. The satire in front of the city 
irates of Angiers when the King of 
France and the King of England are 
bargaining as to its ownerahip and 
the wiadom and the shi'erwdnesa of a 
citizen of the city to avert danger by 
bringing about a marriage, and the 
final result in. a war nevertheless, ia 
a real satire on some of our bargain
ing which goes on in Europe.
The performance was extremely 
well carried out. One could easily 
recognize the master hand of Mr. 
Iden Payne. The scenery was very 
well designed and equally good from 
either aide of the theatre. This is 
something not often accomplished in 
stage craft, and may have something 
to do with the acenery and something 
to do with the design of the theatre. 
The scene iiK the tent was excellent. 
The arch over the entrance to the city 
gates was just going a little too far 
in the way of hocking the architects.
But what I wish to especially bring 
out in this wonderful performance 
was that having watched the School 
of Drama from its inception and hav
ing observed interesting material in 
the way of both boy and girl actors 
and actresses, the interpretation of 
King John by Mr. Lubin made me 
aware that I was witnessing the per
formance of a probable star. It is 
not1 easy to interpret a shrewd and 
forceful but horrible character like 
King John in Shakespeares drama, 
but the performance as given by Mr, 
Lubin was more than excellent. It 
reminded me of past performances 
such as those by Mr. Steene and those 
by Miss Guy.
The whole caste was well rounded 
out. The performance was better 
than anything I have seen offered in 
our theatre in the way of Shakes
pearean performances.
Henry Hornbostel.
Is life worth the trouble of so 
many questions'/
A real question, asked after deep 
thought is worth any amount of time 
but such questions are as rare as 
ugly design school girls.
The majority of questions of these 
times are designed as short cuts to 
knowledge, asked to save w'ork. Or 
else they are mere senseless ques
tions resulting from lack of atten
tion or interest.
Talk's cheap hut time costs money 
and useless questions waste time.
The bird who wrote, Theirs not to 
question why, had the right idea.
We live about sixty-seven years. 
We spend about fifteen minutes each 
day asking useless questions. That 
means that we waste at least eight 
months of our life. We only live 
once. Think it over.
The next time a question pops into 
your head, stop to think whether or 
not -it will affect you in any way to 
know, or if it is any of your business.
If all the time wasted on foolish 
questions since the world began, had 
been used for mechanical invention, 
Cleopatra might have teen a movie 
queen and Columbus might have 
flown to America instead of floated.
Dr. Hamerschlag With 
C.l.T. Since Inception
Sees Great Future and Glory 
For Institution
A great deal of the credit for the 
growth of Carnegie Tech is due to 
Dr. Arthur A. Hamerschlag, the 
President. Andrew Carnegie ap
pointed a, board of trustees to be re^ 
sponsible for the building of the 
school in 1902, and the board ap
pointed Dr. Hamerschlag as a mem
ber of the Committee on Plan and 
Scope.
The next' year, 1903, he was ap
pointed as an executive officer and 
took office in November. He pre
pared the original program for the 
selection of an architect in the com
petition for which Henry Hornbostel 
was successful. During 1904 he can

The casual auditor, whose ideal of 
entertainment, is farce-comedy, 
likely "to be dismayed by the spec
tacle of Echegrays Madman pr Saint. 
If ho recovered from the unrelieved 
distress and anguish which tho play 
offers and perhaps induces, he might 
And time to laugh at its steadily 
stilted rhetoric, its soliloquies, and its 
too thonitiijca'P' devices. To measure 
tho play by tho best contemporary 
standard, is manifestly unfair, for it 
was Urst produced in Spain in 1877, 
tho year in which Ibsens first social 
drama, Tho Pillars of Society was 
printed and a year before it was 
played. In the literature of the the
atre forty-live years are an uneonmiiiiiutbly Jonig time, and no similar 
period has boon more focund in 
changes than that which beganwith 
tho impact of Ibsen upon western 
Kuropo. This Spanish play, encum
bered as Hi Is with the traditions of 
tho national stago, Is an astounding 
example of Ibsenism before Ibsen. 
IN theme,tho difficulties and coniioquoncoa of tolling tho whole truth, 
is a 36N miliar dramaitic motif. Ibsen 
himself treated it later, tragically, in 
The Wild Duck, comically, in An 
Enemy of 'Society. Tlie American 
Nothing but the Truth was appro
priately farcical. But none of thesianalogues. except. The Wild Duck, has 
the subtlety and the tragic signilcance 
of the Echegaray drama. With great 
skill tho dramatist has presented a 
man reduced from splendid absurd 
heroism to the verge of madness by 
the insidious influences of women and 
friends who are eager to compromise 
with the. truth. Through and above 
the antiquated technic, the play makes 
two powerful bids for favor,the in
genuity with which Echegaray has 
prepared for, and worked all the 
values out of, the tremendous scenes 
with which each act ends, and the 
dramatic actualization of a difficult 
ethical conflict. The play is as pow
erful as any we have had this year.
Of the role of Loronzo, an Ameri
can critic lias said, the actor who 
assumes the task of interpreting the 
play does well to accentuate neither 
the morality nor the lunacy of the 
hero overmuch; lie :should rather 
leave in the minds of the spectators 
some doubt as tp Lorenzos folly or 
saintliness. Although Mr. Lubin 
perhaps never saw those lines, he 
creates precisely the effect which the 
critic suggested. As is his habit, he 
moots the demands of an extremely 
varied and fatiguing part. First he 
presents a man self-possessed and 
poised, almost overwhelmed by the 
discovery that his life has boon based 
upon a lio as to his parentage, but 
immediately resolved upon a righteous 
ronuheiatlon. Then beset, by tho ap
peals of all whom ho holds dear, and 
bereft of his now-found mother, he 
is unsettled by the suspicions of his 
family, and almost succumbs to the 
thought that, he is actually insane. 
All those changes and violences of 
fooling this young actor projects in
imitably. In the best of the womens
ECONOMY AMONG STUDENTS
All the world loves a cheerful giv
er. When drives come along, we 
reverence the magnificent person 
who. rises to pledge extravagantly; 
we have a warm feeling in our hearts, 
toward the jolly individual who 
sweeps all of the soda checks into 
his hand and says, Never mind, 
this is myi treat. We admire good 
clothes, and although we speak in 
a friendly and democratic way to 
sweaters, we form our friends among 
fur-coats, if possible. If we. attend 
all of the good theatrical events, en
tertain royally at dinners, and never 
turn away a friend who asks for a 
loan, we glow with conviviality and 
wo have a large following among 
tlie student body.
The question His, is it our own 
money that we; are lavish with? 
Millionaires soys and daughters 
have a right to scatter their dol
lars, but often |an examination of 
facts will show tllat the young Croe
sus at school is-' being supported hy 
tho fruits of a b,oot-blaeklng estab
lishment at home, wherens the plain 
clothes man'may have a background 
of yachts and ancestral banquet 
halls. If one makes his own money, 
is Ills to spend until he runs 
through it, but when Father Is 
clerking at the bank until all hours 
of the night, Mother Is taking in 
,1'omers, and the children are wear
ing their old shoos and patched 
rompers to send our boy to collogo, the student should remember 
that if ho 1b a spendthrift under 
such conditions, lio is a merciless 
extortioner.

SEEKING THE IDEAL MATE
What qualities and characteris
tics are moat to be desired in a 
helpmate? This question recently 
wu8 put to the mixed class in evo
lution and eugenics at tlie Univer
sity of Chicago, with the following 
results:
The girls ranked good health first, 
then character, disposition, financial 
standing, education, paternity, ap
pearance, dress and ancestry. The 
men also favored good health to 
lead and ranked the following qual
ities next in the order named: .good 
disposition, beauty, education, ma
ternity, housekeeping, character, 
dress, ancestry, and financial stand
ing. Love was out of. the running.
The main thing is 'both women and 
men students chose health above all. 
Some criticism may be found with 
the men for ranking character well 
clown below beauty and with the 
women for placing financial stand
ing above education, but on the 
whole and as a wiiole, marriages 
adapted to the standards as set down 
by both, would have fewer failures.
Good health is the most import
ant possession in all the world. 
With it success conies as an inci
dent. Without itj It conies as a 
painfully, won reward surrounded en
tirely by the most heroic sacrifices. 
It affects the living and those who 
are to live, the present* and tho fu
ture. If marriages were made on 
the basis of character and health 
alone, success in after-life probably 
would become the rule rather than 
tho oxception,
The questionnaire proves nothing 
but it. :1s interesting. It. shows that 
young people are beginning to think. 
And in thinking rests the --social 
sanity and safety of tho social or
der, Dayton .Tournai.
PRES. A. A. HAMERSCLAG
outlined the proposed institution and 
selected the original members of the 
Staff and the Faculty.
The actual work on the buildings 
was begun in April. 1905, Mrs. Ham
erschlag breaking the ground. When 
the school was completed Dr. Hamer
schlag became President, and has 
held the office ever since that time. 
In 1912 he succeeeded in securing a 
charter for the school with the power 
to grant degrees.
Dr. Hamerschlag. believes in the 
motto of Andrew 'Carnegie i.e.,that 
to select abler men than himself is 
the surest method of forming a part
nership in which the combined 
strength of all can be consecrated for 
the benefit of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology. He puts no Alma 
Mater ahead of our own and he firmly 
believes that the future of Carnegie 
Tech is 'going to be so great that 
there is enough glory in just having 
the privilege of having participated 
in the development of the Institution.
Bill Says
Did it ever occur' to you that the 
student body on the whole lacks that 
air of common fellowship which ought 
to exist in every school? How many 
times do you pass another Carnegie 
mail' on the campus and fail to pass 
the time of day? You may know his 
name; you may never have been in
troduced to him, but at rtny rate a 
word of greeting surely goes a long 
way in making friends and bringing 
about a closer fellowship among Cnrnogie Tech men.
Tho fact that our school is located 
in a largo city probably has a great 
deal to do with the existing condi
tions, but every one can help in spite 
of that fact,-in developing a feeling 
of cordiality among the students. 
The writer has an idea. It needs 
development. The help of others with 
the interest of the school at heart 
is needed. The formation of a group 
of picked men at, the beginning of 
next year, who have the initiative to 
create a movement to "speak to the 
other fellow is the writers idea. If 
this group of men will go out on the 
campus next fall with the determina
tion to greet each and every Carnegie 
man just because he is a fellow clans
man, the start of better fellowship 
among the students will have an in
ception. Have you any ideas on the 
matter? Do you care to help? Then 
hand in your name and address to C. 
I. T. Post office, care Bill Says,

Perhaps those who attended the 
vaudeville show during campus week 
wall remember the successful hick 
song stunt given there. The song 
entitled Si McNadd, has been con
tributed to the song contest arid is 
printed in full below.
The words to this song were writ
ten by T. S. Repplier, and the music 
was composed by K. T. Milne.
PART I.
Si McNadd was a farmer lad 
Who 'lowed hed like to go 
To learn about machinery 
Like the city fellows know;
So he packed his comb and his best 
toothbrush and his flannel B. V. D. 
Kissed Old Sal good-bye 
With a tear dimmed eye 
As he left for C. I. T.
CHORUS:
Sti-anger, stranger kin you tell me 
Where is Mister Carnegie 
And is this where I learns to know 
What makes Pops old tin lizzie go? 
Neighbor, Neighbor, whats the rea
son
That Lightnin bugs kin be?
Ohthe gosh durned farm she aint 
what she used to be 
Without Technology.
PART II.
They put our Si in Science School 
An engineer to be,
To figure out the Calculus 
And the trigonometry.
But despite the toil and the midnight 
oil
Poor Sis wits ebbed away,
And.each ancient Prof could be heard 
to scoff 
As Si would humbly say;
CHORUS;
Stranger, stranger, kin you tell me 
Where is Mister Carnegie?
And why with eyes as good as mine 
Do I have to heckle with a big co-sine, 
Neighbor, Neighbor whats the rea
son
A secant cannot see?
Ohthe gosh durned farm she aint 
what she used to be 
Without Technology.
CHORUS;
Stranger, stranger kin you tell me 
Where is Mister Carnegie?
And do you meter at a hundred yards, 
Kin you play Casino with the Indica
tor Cards?
Neighbor, neighbor whats the rea
son .
Them currents bit at me?
Ohthe gosh durn farm she aint 
what she used to be 
Without Technology.
PART III.
The more Si boned the worse 'he got. 
(I hate to tell his fate)
In fact lie did not really know 
That two times six is eight 
So he cast one look where the flappers 
are vAt that school so grand and fine 
And he said Bye Geclc
Ill be an architect 
For Im going to Design.
CHORUS;
Stranger, stranger can you tell me 
Where is Mister Carnegie?
What is this funny kind of song 
Why do them fellers let their hair 
.grow long 
Neighbor, neighbor whats the reason 
They put bow ties on me?
Ohthe gosh durned farm she aint 
what she used to'be 
Without Technology.
CHORUS;
Stranger, stranger kin you tell me 
Where is Mister Carnegie?
And aint them funny fellers fakes? 
What happens to the money that the

\
Sinith Celebrates Return to 
Game With Victory
All track men are requested and 
invited to attend a get-together to 
be held at the D. U. house next Wed
nesday evening at 7:30 oclock. The 
captain for next year will be elected 
at this meeting.
The' diamond artists of Carnegie 
Tech : invaded West Virginia Tuesday. 
May i *0, and returned with another 
victor} 7 over Bethany College. The 
score was 3-0. A feature of the game 
was ,f Smiths splendid pitching for the 
Skit,osHe had the Buffaloes eating 
frrjm his hand throughout.
It was anybodys game until the 
eighth inning, when Carnegie romped 
home with two runs. One more was 
garnered in the ninth, and the Buf
faloes were too thoroughly stamped
ed to be daneerous.
Smith opened tlie eighth by draw
ing a walk. Joe Doherty followed 
with a single. Ray Doherty reached 
first, Smith going out at third. Dur
kin likewise attained the initial sack 
while J. Doherty was being put out 
at third. With two men on base, 
Godden saw his chance and produced 
a two-base hit, bringing in R. Doherty 
and Durkin. Irwin was thrown out 
at first, ending Carnegies half of the 
inning.
In their half of the eighth, Beth
any succeeded in getting three men 
as far as first base. But due to snap
py fielding on the part of the Tar
tans, they could not advance further.
With one out in the ninth Mills 
singled, stole second while Robert
son was striking out, and came in 
with the final tally on Smiths bingle.
The contest was an exciting pitching 
duel until the eighth inning, with 
Smith pitching a steadier, more con
sistent game. Randolph, of Betlufny, 
issued three bases on balls, while 
Smith gave only one free pass. The 
fielding honors were about even, 
neither team erring seriously, and 
all runs were earned. The score:

Last Thursday afternoon on Carne

the Pittsburgh Collegians by the 
score of 10 to 7.
Warrick started the game for Car
negie and the Collegians fell on his 
offering in the first inning for a to
tal of four hits before he was re
lieved by McCaw. For the remainder 
of the game McCaw pitched good 
ball, allowing only two hits. The 
eight runs secured in the first 
ning coupled with two secured in 
the sixth was tod great a handicap 
for the Plaid to overcome, but they 
tried hard securing one run in the 
second and six in the fourth for a 
total of seven runs.

WE CANT KICK!
The C. I. T. spring sports season being at an end, wo are safe in re
joicing in the ownership of the best tennis and track teams in the Tri-State 
district, and of a baseball team which we believe almost as good as the best.
Of the tennis team there is no doubt whatever. Allegheny is our closest 
rival, and our friend across the hollow, Pitt, comes next.
The same can truly be said of track. Pitt has the only team in the 
section capable of competing on equal terms with the Plaid team. The 
comparative scores against West Virginia prove this. Pitt is stronger in 
the field and weight events, and Carnegie on the track, and it is only a 
question of which is stronger' by a large enough number of points to win a 
meet, and therefore the championship.
In baseball. Coach Enos Kirkpatrick has welded together a formidable 
team, and barring handicaps would have finished better in the Tri-State 
race. The accident to Smith in the midst of the season took from the team 
the best twirler in this district. The condition of the playing field hurt, 
but when it is considered that visiting teams suffer probably more on that 
score, in not being accustomed to its many and variable contortions, consola
tion is not available there. But, at the same time, it is believed a, perfect 
field produces better ball teams. It is hoped this will be remedied next year, 
as playing on such a diamond gives visiting teams bad impressions, and is 
conductive to injuries.
AND WHILE ON THE SUBJECT 
it seems as if the Administration would act wisely in building for the use 
of athletics better facilities for their furtherance. The aid on the football 
field, and the new gym are good steps in the right direction, and for them, 
we of the student body are surely appreciative. Among the things that could 
be done are the building of more tennis courts; the building of a turtle-back 
baseball diamond, and a practice football field.
The former two could be classed under the Physical Education Depart
ment. Tennis is the best recreation for all students. It takes only a short 
time, and the results of one hours play cannot be over estimated. The pres
ent equipment of six courts is inadequate. Tournament play and varsity 
matches makes it unfair to the students who wish to use the courts for 
recreation.
The numerous Inter-Fraternity baseball games played this spring gives 
evidence of the popular rise of the national game for x-ecreation purposes 
by students. There was and is a game every eveuing. The diamond, poor 
as it is, is constantly in use by students other than the varsity.
AND SO, IN SUGGESTION:
The Administration could spend $10,000 or $15,000 in no way of more 
profit to the school and student body as a whole than in this way of offering 
chances for recreation. It is understood that large sums of money are 
being spent daily on the landscape. Why not redirect these funds to the 
aid of the students, and beautify the campus at the same time? Beautifying 
the campuswhat to a full-blooded American is more beautiful than a mod
ern, up-to-date athletic field? It is the use of such that has made America 
the greatest nation in the world.
The cut is ideal for such. Six new tennis courts could be placed closo 
to Forbes street, and bordering the ,liill. These, with grass growing all 
around, would surely beautify the campus, and they would not in the least 
interfere with the baseball diamond laid out where it was throughout the 
past season.

Many improvements /In athletic 
equipment will be made soon at Bucknell, along with the erection of a new 
stadium and a new 'gymnasium. 
These will include a football field, 
a baseball diamond* a 20-foot track 
with a 220-yard straight away, and 
tennis courts for inter-collegiate con' 
tests. The stadium will be of con
crete, and work on it will begin soon.
IMPORTANT ATHLETIC COUNCIL ACTIONS
The two motions passed at the meeting of May 22nd are printed for the 
information of the students.
That any member of a varsity team shall be declared ineligible for 
further competition who during term time, represents any other athlotic 
organization in competition, unless he has previously obtained the permis
sion of the athletic authorities, except during the summer vacation, athlotics 
may be participated in provided the athlete does not play organized base
ball.
This question is clearly stated, and therefore loaves no room for doubt 
whatever.
The other motion is a formal passing of the Freshman Rule. It. says: 
That, effective September, 1923, no student of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology shall be eligible to compete in any varsity intereolleglato con
test during his Freshman year.
It is a pleasure to see that ruling passed, becauso In 1923, it togelhor 
with the Migratory Rule and Degree Rule, gives Carnegie Tech eligibility 
code on a par with the best in the country.

DORM SENIORS DUCKED; 
ALL LOSE MUCH SLEEP
About thirty seniors residing in 
dormitories were rather unostenta
tiously aroused last Friday morning, 
slightly before cock crow by a motley 
band of underclassmen, and were 
given a preliminary farewell. A 
water filled bath tub in the basement 
of McGill Hall was the center of the 
scene and here the 'Seniors, for the 
first time since their Plebe year, re
ceived an unsolicited bath, although 
it must be admitted that some of the 
administrators wei*e as well as the 
recipients.
For sthe benefit of milady we must 
add that pajamas were in the vogue 
although quite a few of the more 
select made their appearance in bath 
robes. No Senior escaped due to 
the dexterity of some of the Sophs in 
jimmying a door with a spoona 
talent learned through practice after 
the Soph banquet. Due to the in
ability of the Seniors to make a unit
ed resistance they were readily over
come, and quiet did not again reign 
until near dawn.

and is two stories high to faoilitato 
lighting and proper natural ventila
tion. This room has sufficient showor 
rooms and minor accommodations ad
joining to handle any number of men. 
Close to and connected with the locker 
room are two handball courts (16x32) 
a wrestling and boxing room (20x30) 
and a room for special corrective ex
ercises, besides two other exercise 
rooms which will be used on alternate 
days by both men and women. Among 
the sfnaller accommodations are the 
physicians offices, examination room, 
a graduate managers office, a mas
sage and first aid room, a visiting

Besides their own gymnasium floor 
the women will have a club or rest 
room, three special exercise rooms 
and necessary administrative offices.. 
The locker rooms are on two floors, 
each group having separate shower 
rooms and dressing cabinets and have 
direct connection to the women's gym
nasium, which is two stories high 
with a small gallery surrounding it.
The swimming pool is in a sepaijate 
building which lies between the main 
building and the College of Fine Arts, 
with direct communication to all 
locker rooms and showers. The loca
tion facilities proper lighting and 
ventilation of the pool which is 35 
feet wide and 75 feet long and has 
a broad platform entirely around it 
for the use of collapsible bleachers 
when necessary.
In view of the fact that the present 
out-door theater will be destroyed, the 
end of the gymnasium building 
towards Shenley Park is being uti
lized as a setting for a new and larger 
theater or outdoor stage.
The trees on the present plot will 
be removed and transplanted over the 
immediate grounds and will assist 
greatly in providing the necessary en 
tourage for the latest additif to the 
campus.
The Carnegie Tech track squad 
completed another most successful 
season on the cinder path with the 
conclusion of the West Virginia du
al meet on the last day of Campus 
Week. The Plaid track field men 
suffered but one defeat this spring 
and that to a university which is 
rated high in athletics in the Mid
dle West.
The Tartan relay team opened the 
season by winning a clean cut vic
tory at the Penn Relays oil April 29. 
By taking this event they brought 
home the Technical School Relay 
Championship. < Kelly ran in the 100- 
yard dash, getting into the finals 
but failed to make a place in the 
latter. The next track event was 
the Sixth Annual Interscholastic Meet 
combined with a dual meet between 
Caruegie and Marietta at Schenley 
Oval. Bellefonto Academy took the 
scholastic meet with 31 points while 
the Plaid overwhelmed Marietta, win
ning by the one-sided score of 12S-1S. 
The Interscholastic Meet was the 
largest conducted so far and no 
doubt will continue to grow in im
portance in this section.. At Colum
bus the Tartans met their one and 
only defeat at the hands of Ohio 
State University. The score stood 
81-45, but the meet was by no means 
a walk-away for the Buckeyes who 
were forced to the limit in almost 
every event. Mt. Union College wa 
the next to go down to defeat at 
the hands of Sldbo runners, the final 
accounting showing the score to be 
105-21. Then on the final day of 
Campus Week, the West Virginia 
trackers wore taken over, 915 to 
13Ms, in a dual meot at Schenloy 
Oval.
Track was conducted this spring 
under rather adverso conditions. 
Duo to work going on down at tlio 
field, the men wero forced to jour
ney to Schenloy Oval each ovoning 
for their practice. Coach hidings j 
doservos much credit for Iho way in 
which ho has continuod to dovolop 
and round out the team. Ho has 
givon the men personal attention and 
helped thorn In correcting ovory lit
tle fault. Old men on the squad 
who had boon merely pluggors wore 
coached and Improved to such an ex
tent that they wero usod In sovoral 
of the moots. The field ovonts have 
boon a, nemesis for the Sltlbos, but 
a notlcoablo Improvement was shown 
this year. There are a number of 
mon on tlio squad who desorvo men
tion lor their good work. Foromost 
among those In Kelley who, again 
performed consistently In the cen
tury and right, along beside him 
should bo mentioned Dykoman, who 
has been stopping the distance in 
great stylo. Szold In the quarter, 
Miller, Bleach, Garo and Hovoral oth
ers havo all dono their share In 
bringing honors to the Plaid.
Without, a doubt, Carneglo Tocll 
can claim tho best track outfit In the 
Trl-Stato section with the Technical 
School Relay Championship thrown 
In. ,Sovoral good men will be lost, 
by graduation and It will bo more 
difficult to turn out a team of such 
high caliber next spring.

On Friday evening a very enjoy
able snioker was held in the U. S. 
Bureau of Mines by Theta Tau Fra
ternity. An interesting movie was 
shown in which the Bureau made 
some experiments of gases encoun
tered in the driving of tho Liberty 
tunnel in New York. Prof. Iiowor 
and Prof. Keir gave interesting talks, 
after which all tho guests repaired 
to tho thirds floor and enjoyed re
freshments. As a professional fra
ternity Theta Tau has had great sue-, 
cess tin its work this year.
Tho complete victory over tho 
Marietta College tennis team lias 
brought our own team within three 
matches of the close of the schedule. 
The Marietta boys fought hard but 
they were opposed by a much su-1 
perior team.
Captain Neville, Schwartz, Copley 1 
and Keil each walked away with their \ 
single matches which were little more 
than practice for them.
The double proved a bit more in
teresting because our machines com
posed of Neville and Schwartz, and 
Copley and Keil were trying out a 
hotter system of covering the courts 
from all angles against their oppo
sition. They hope to make use of 
this greater advantage in the matches 
with Allegheny on Monday and Syracurse on Tuesday.

A letter Just received from R. W. 
Arnold, Industries graduate 1021
states that plan are under way for 
Tech Alumni to meet on September 
28 at which time Tech and Yale clash 
on the gridiron. If the right interest 
i:; manifested for this affair it will 
without a doubt surpass all past
alumni gatherings out of Pittsburgh. 
This being the first football game of 
tho season should be enough to bring 
out all of Tech alumni in the New 
Haven district and back the team to 
tho limit. In order to make this a 
big success, we hope that the New 
York and Boston Clans will get on 
tho job early and try to put this big 
gathering , across. More details of 
tho first alumni gathering for the 
year 1022-23 Will be published in a
later issue of the Tartan.

Tho first day ol May, 1922; -will 
go down in the annals of Carnegie 
Tech Clans as a red letter day be
cause on that momentous occasion 
the Southern California Clan was of
ficially organized. Fred Foster 08 
who in tho early days at Weidlins 
Saloon founded everything around 
Tech from the Tartan to the White 
.Friars is the real organizer of this 
/Ian. Much credit is due him for 
-rflio spirit that has spread along the 
Pacific Coast for the better interests 
of Carnegie Tech. Mr. Fosters 
splendid talk was followed by Mrs. 
Mary McKee Kilton speech in which 
she gave many reminiscences of hor 
class, *09. Other speakers wero as 
follows: Miss Otillio Stoc;lce, M. M. 
*12, C. M. Crawford, Science 13', 
Margaret Diehl Ilazzard, M. M. 14. 
Ermal Pruyme Ralston, M. M. '17 
and Mrs. Inez Peacock Pille, M. M. 
'17. As Foster states More of tho 
crooks are going West," 1921 is rep
resented by five members to-wit: Ad
dison A. Mankel, Science; William J. 
Reilly, Science; Ralph J. Crosby, 
Arts; Cloyde D. Dalzell, Arts, and 
Michael J. Thomas, Industries.
Tuesday opens the pveek for the 
school paper. It is then that the score 
of reporters made up almost entirely 
of underclassmen stop a I the office 
of the Carnegie Tartan for their 
weekly assignments. The News Edi
tor has several pages of school news 
to be covered. Bill Jones is put on 
the trail of the graduate manager 
for the latest dope on the new ath
letic field. John Smith calls on Dr. 
Baker for the administrative news; 
every assembly finds one of the cubs 
taking notes on the lecture for the; 
article on the assembly, in fact, every 
incident about the campus is covered 
by the young newspaperman who in 
an endeavor to do Something for the 
school and at the same time work 
for a position on the staff, trys to 
do his best.
Throughout the week the news is 
gathered and by Friday, evening ma
terial for next weeks Tartan has been 
turned in from every source. The 
Exchange Editor reads what other 
schools 'have to say through the me
dium of their papers and collects 
what is worth while. Roamer walks 
about the campus murmuring in 
short sentences the contents of the 
Roamins Column; Bill looks about 
for someone who has a complaint to 
make about the. trend of affairs in 
general and accumulates material for 
Bill Says. The Editor^in-Chief eats, 
sleeps, and studies over the editorial 
for the next issue and the Athletic 
Editor hurries his charges out for 
material for the Plaid Screen and 
the sporting news. The Business 
Manager worries over the financial af
fairs connected with the paper and 
with the Advertising in the Tartan.
Scene Two opens on Sunday after
noon in the Tartan office in Indus
tries Building. The Managing Editor 
is the cntr f>f attraction, sitting be
fore the Mummy surrounded by a 
score of helpers. One reporter in-- 
forms him that the chairman of the 
Senior Ball committee wants a head
line in the next issue announcing the 
Senior Ball; another reports that the 
general committee of one of the 
classes sees no reason why their meet
ing announcement should not be one 
of the twenty-four point stories, and 
to top.;it all off, the advertising man
ager of one of the clubs hurries into 
the office with an air that the entire 
first page should be reserved for that 
organization.
In an atmosphere as this he starts 
his work. He hands the copy to the 
News Editor to be read over. It is 
at this time that every attempt is 
made to jrival Webster; a new dic
tionary could easily be made up of 
the words contained in the write
ups but the News Editor deems it 
wiser to stick to -the laws laid down 
in Wefbster and corrects the mis
spelled words. Now and then a poor
ly written article fails to respond to 
the interpreting powers of the reader 
and finds a resting place in the Tar
tan files,the waste basket.
The satisfactory articles are en
tered on the dummy and the edi
torial assistants go about their work 
of writing the headings and 'here 
again Websters name is used in vain 
when the young assistant can't understand why that noted character made 
the word longer by using two ms 
where one would have sufficed.
Finally the dummy is completed 
and the Managing Editor heaves a 
sigh of relief and transfers his bur
den to the printer.
At tho official opening of thin 
splendid Clan were the following Tech 
graduates: Frederick Foster '0,8, Mary 
McKoo Kilton '09, Otillio .Stpeke '12, 
C. M. Crawford '13, Marguerite Diehl 
Mazzard '15, Ermal Pruyme Ralston 
17, Inez Peacock Pille '17, Cloyde A. 
Dalzell '21, M'ichaol J. Thomas '21, 
Ralph J. Crosby '21, Addison A. Man
uel 21, William .J. Reilly '21. After 
a real get-together-the business meet
ing was called to order at which time 
plans wore mado for the drawing up 
of By-Laws.
Tho officers elected wero as fol
lows: C. M. Crawford, president;
Mary McKee Kilton, vice president; 
W, J. Reilly, secretary-treasurer; Er
mal Pruyme Ralston and Inez Pea
cock Pille, members of the executive 
committee.
After the official opening of the 
Southern California Clan they didnt 
seem to be satisfied so went further 
and selected W. J. Reilly, '21 to rep
resent them at Campus Week. At 
tho Alumni Banquet on May 27, Mr.
