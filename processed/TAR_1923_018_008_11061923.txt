PRINCE TO SPEAK 
ON CARNEGIE DAY
ROBERTSON SCORES
Coming to Pittsburgh with a heavy, 
experienced team, confident of win-1 
ning by reason of the fact that they 
had never previously been beaten by 
a Tartan aggregation, Lehigh was de
clared the winner after a gruelling 
struggle lasting sixty minutes on 
Forbes Field, Saturday, the final 
count being 13-6.
We use the expression they were 
declared the winner advisedly, for 
though they came out on the long end 
of the score and deserve every bit of 
glory they can get out of it, they 
must of necessity give Lady Luck the 
major portion of the credit for the 
victory. It was a break of the game 
which happens once in a lifetime with 
an experienced team such as the Ski
bos have this year that put the visit
ors from Eastern Pennsylvania in a 
scoring position in the first period of 
play. Had it not been for an unfor
tunate fumble of a slightly high pass 
in the first quarter the Lehigh aggre
gation would not have once threat
ened the Skibo goal line, as subse
quent events showed. The second 
touchdown of the visitors came late 
In the last quarter on an intercepted 
forward pass, and was largely a fluke 
due to the desperation of the Tartans 
to score after trailing by one point.
Contrary to expectations, the Car
negie team entered the game on 
Fathers Day fully cognizant of the 
hard battle to follow. It had been 
thought that after their great victory 
over Pitt the week previous, the Tar
tans would be extremely over-confi
dent. Shell, however, was not the 
case and our boys, though defeated, 
covered themselves with glory. Had 
they received their share of the

Gelasio Cactani, Italian Em
bassador Accepts Our 
Invitation
Thistle is to Hold 
Novel Election Soon
Most Handsome Seniors to 
be Announced in Book
It has been proclaimed far and wide 
through the medium of these columns 
that the 1924 Thistle is to be the ace 
among year books. It is logical to ex
pect, therefore, that something new 
and original will be incorporated in 
the book which the Thistle board, 
composed of Juniors is offering.
A novel idea to which much inter
est should be attached has been 
evolved by the enterprising members 
of the staff. The plan concerns the 
Seniors, male and female, of all 
schools and outlined briefly is this:
An election will be held for the pur
pose of determining the Senior man 
or woman who, by popular vote is the 
most handsome, the most conceited, 
the most popular and so on, the list 
including most of the well-known 
offices of that nature. Ballots will be 
printed, and distributed immediately 
following class meetings on Novem
ber 6.
All Seniors are urged to consider 
this election in a serious light, and to 
weigh carefully the qualities of each 
respective candidate. Every Senior 
will be given a ballot with expecta
tion are to be incorporated as a

PRINTERS DEVIL LOOSE AGAIN 
OMIT ANNOUNCEMENT OF M. M.
The Tartan duly apologizes for va
rious and sundry errors appearing in 
the last issue as a result of an excess 
of spiritsnot the tangible kindim
bibed over the week-end.
The riot included in sororities was 
entirely unintentional and a notice 
concerning M. M. assembly was most 
unfortunately omitted. We also wish 
to emphasize that Bert Munhall was 
not kissed upon the under portion 
of his cranium as stated but upon the 
nude portion.
Prince Gelasio Caetani, Italys new 
ambassador to the United States, has 
accepted an invitation to speak at Car
negie Tech on Carnegie Day, Novem
ber 23, according to an announcement 
made by Thomas S. Baker.
The new Italian ambassador was 
born of one of the oldest families of 
Europe, later coming to the United 
States where he graduated in 1903 
from the S'chool of Mines, Columbia 
University. The World War found 
Caetani still in this country, but he 
returned to Italy immediately and be
came a captain in the Engineer Corps.
The war record of Prince Gelasio is 
an enviable one. He was advanced 
to the rank of Colonel and three .times 
was decorated for bravery. It was 
Caetani who laid the mine that, with 
a single blast blew up the whole top 
of the Col di Lani, which destroyed 
an Austrian fort and opened the way 
for the Italian army through the Cordevale Pass in the Upper Trentlno.
To accomplish it, he designed a gal
lery under the fort nearly 2,000 feet 
long. This feat was made possible 
by the practical engineering experi
ence he had in this country.
As the public is usually invited to 
share with Carnegie Tech students in 
the annual observance of Carnegie 
Day, the appearance of Prince Gela
sio on the days program will doubt
less be of particular interest to Pitts
burghers.
It will be the first public appear
ance in this city of the new ambas
sador, and one of the first in this 
country since he assumed his diplo
matic office in Washington last Jan
uary.
MAY PLEBES TAKE GIRLS
TO GAMES? COUNCIL ASKS
Shall or shall not the Plebes take 
girls to the football games?. This 
question was discussed at the last 
meeting of Die Student Council. It 
was referred to the Plebe Regula
tions Committee for decision.
Frances McClymonds, Arthur Brace 
and V. S. Mollenauer were appointed 
on a committee to confer with tho 
Athletic Council In regard to the 
payment of expenses incurred by the 
cheerleaders at the football games.
Last weeks Tartan had an article 
stating that the Tri Gam Sorority 
had been recognized by the Student 
Council. This was an error as the 
council has no jurisdiction over so
cial organizations such as fraterni
ties and sororities.

with the lecture.
Mr. Wensley is a switchboard engi
neer and is in charge of the depart

East Pittsburgh plant of the Westing
house Company, and for that reason 
is well qualified to present a paper 
on this new and important branch of 
Electrical Engineering.
This paper deals with the possible 
inaccuracies of telephonic communica

operators by the large amount of time 
required for answering telephone

Parents Came From Far and Near 
Joyously Greet Their Children Dear
Official announcement that the 
headquarters company of the 107th 
Field Artillery, National Guard of 
Pennsylvania, is to be recruited at 
Carnegie was made last week by the 
Department of Military Science and 
Tactics. Positive assurance that the 
unit will be composed entirely of Car
negie students, with one Carnegie 
man a commissioned officer, lod the 
heads of the department to enthus
iastically back the plan. Forty men 
have already given their names as be
ing interested in the idea. Enlist
ment is not limited to tlioso taking 
the R. O. T. C. course. All physically 
fit male students are eligible.
The headquarters company num
bers 51 men, more than three-fourths 
of whom are mounted. It provides 
most of the non-commlssionod officers 
for the regiment, togethor with the 
communication, scout, and sketching 
and map-malclng sections. Tho com
pany engages In infantry mounted, 
and gun drill ono and a half hours 
one evening each week. The night 
will be the one most convenient for 
the majority. One dollar is paid to 
the men for each drill attended. Fif
teen days at camp in July or August 
also with pay, is the only other time 
required.
Mr. L. E. Smith, who has for many 
years been with the Bell Telephone 
Company of Pennsylvania is captain 
of the company. Mr. A. IT. Anderson, 
23, Mechanical, will be commissioned 
second lieutenant. Mr. C. R. Hogle 
is also expected to qualify as a com
missioned officer.

Committees for Junior 
Banquet Are Appointed
The Junior Banquet is to be held 
on December 15. At a rfecent meeting 
committees were appointed and at a 
latter date all information pertaining 
to the banquet will be printed.
Mr. Kalifelz is chairman of the 
committee, Mellor, James, Frazier, 
Sload and Garfer are on the com
mittee. They have suggested to the 
Juniors a united banquet for the 
women and men. So far this seem: 
to be favorable to the class.
In past years the Junior Banquet 
has been a somewhat rough affair. 
The committee this year is endeav 
oring to put on a better banquet, onthat will he remembered for the good 
time that everyone had there.
The banquet will probably be held 
at the Fort Pitt. The program ia 
being arranged now and will appear 
in the next issue of this paper.
Prelim tickets for the banquet will 
be on sale on the campus Monday, 
November 5, at $1.00 each.

INTER-SORORITY RULES 
FOR RUSHING ADOPTED
(By Carl Gunther.)
Over two hundred parents indi-j 
cated interest in their childrens i 
welfare, last Saturday, by registering 
at the Y office for the first Fathers 
Day ever held at Carnegie. The af
fair was so successful and satisfac
tory to everyone concerned that it 
shall be made an annual affair.
The laboratories, shops and stu-! 
dios underwent a gruelling inquisi
tion at the hands of interested par
ents, throughout the morning, and 
survived after creating a very good 
impression of service, utility and 
completeness.
The real events of the day began 
with the Lehigh game, gloom and 
contempt or simulated interest 
marked most of the family groups
throughout the first quarter. During 
the second period, however, when the 
Plaid broke loose, fathers tried to! 
out-cheer their, sons and staid motixers hugged their daughters in joyous 
ecstacy as the Tartan eleven plough
ed down the field.
If the game was lost, its moral ef
fect upon the older people was ampla 
recompense, for a finer display of 
Carnegie spirit could hardly have 
been created and would certainly 
have lacked the impressiveness which 
a touch of pathos added to it.
The evening began with a supper 
in 'the Commons followed by the 
speeches of such celebrities as Judge 
Reed, Frank Lanahan. Dean Connelly, 
Directors Mott and Morris, Buddy

DRAMA DEPT. SEASON
OPENED WITH MAGDA
On Wednesday evening, October 31, 
1923, the dramatic season at Carnegio 
Tech was ushered In. Sudermans 
Magda, a favorite role of the famous 
Bernhardt, was the first offering. The 
conflict of a free, artistic spirit with 
the regorous conventions of the nine
teenth century is the theme of the 
play. A temperamental opera singer 
against a conservative old German 
household as a background show each 
side's short comings. The leading 
roles were excellently played by Ellen 
Lowe, Joseph Lazarus, Paul McGrath 
and Charles McCarthy. They were 
ably supported by Mary Power, Mary 
Spurkay, Elizabeth S'owersby, Mary 
Brown, Harriet Walker, Beth Lind
say, Dorothy Schell, Verner Haldlni, 
James Resley and Ben Weinblatt.
As a result of the Inter-fraternity 
rushing rules th Inter-Sorority Coun
cil has now formulated a similar set 
of regulations for sororities.
The Inter-Sorority Council passed 
the following rushing rules:
Advanced  Standing students: 
Shall be rushed from beginning of 
semester until the Monday after 
Thanksgiving vacation on which day 
they may be pledged.
Freshmen Students: Freshmen
girls may be rushed only three distinct 
instances or at three distinct func
tions. One function to be held the 
first semester and two functions to be 
held the second semester. The date 
and kind of a function to be given 
may be decided by each individual 
sorority. The bids are to be passed 
out through the office of the Dean of 
Women on the Monday following 
Campus Week and are to be returned 
through the office of the Dean of 
I Women on the following Thursday.

I SCHOOL SUSPENDED BOTH 
DAY AND NIGHT ON MONDAY

j Because Armistice day comes on 
I Sunday this year, the Monday followI ing has been set aside by Governor

i of this it has been announced that

Carnegie Collegians New 
Orchestra About Campus
The latest edition in the way of 
college orchestras has appeared un
der the name of the Carnegie Col
legians. Tills orchestra is being di
rected by Steve Kovach and is made 
up of Carnegie students. Its mem
bership consists of Wib Cunning
ham and Don Sonnemann, former 
Imps; Wm. Wallace of the "Palais 
Royal Entertainers, Wm. Lockart o' 
the Serenaders, Ed Spahr of the 
"Valley Six, and Paul Bott of the 
"Blue Ridge Five. This aggrega
tion have worked hard for the past 
few weeks and expect to strut 
their stuff shortly. The director and 
"Wib Cunningham who will be man
ager expect the Collegians to re
ceive almost as big an oration as 
the Collegiate Imps did when they re
turned from Chautauqua Lake.
SCOBELL HALL ENDEAVORS
TO RESTORE LOST SPIRIT
Where is that old Carnegie spirit, 
which showed Itself around the dorm
itories of both the men and women, 
In the form of signs and posters jusr. 
before the Notre Dame football game 
last year? Is that spirit dead?
In an untiring effort to restore this 
lost spirit, Scoboll Hall has been put
ting up a good slogan before every 
big game this seanon, and ono will 
bo put up for each of tho remaining 
gamos.
The dorms aro supposed to havo tho 
greatest spirit, for It Is thero that tlio 
largest number of men and women of 
Carnegie Tech aro gathered togothor. 
It is hoped that tho other dorms will 
now follow S'coboll Halls ezamplo, 
and work up a great Carnogle spirit 
for the remaining games of the Boason.

TRAIN IS UNCERTAIN
First premonitions of tlio champion
ship rifle matches scheduled to bogin 
next Tuesday were felt last week 
when the popping of guns in the sixth 
sub-cellar of M. M. College bocamo 
almost incessant. Tho R. O. T. C. 
Sophomores wore getting down to tho 
serious business of becoming crack 
shots. The matches are . open to all 
R. O. T. C. men. As they last for 
two weeks, everyone will have oppor
tunity to show his stuff. Whon tho 
individual championship has been de
cided, a second series of matches will 
be hold to determine tho unit with 
keenest eyes and steadiest norves.
Sergeant Sullivan, the supply room 
solon, Is dispensing information In 
tho delicate art of making tho bullet 
go whore tho gun Is pointed. Many 
Inexperienced riflemen havo boon de
tected in his quarters taking a swig 
at tho fount of knowledge. Those 
who have not lmd at least ono drink 
aro conceded little chanco for a good 
scoro.
Tho important thing about those 
matches for Carnogio Is that from tho 
contestants aro to bo soloctod tho 
mon to shoot for tho William Ran
dolph Iloarst Trophy and In tho Intorcolloglates. It is hoped that tho mon 
will got down to work and bring a 
fow powtor mugs to Alma Mater.
Fresh mon who havo novor yot mu

tho trigger and other fine points of

FOOTBALL DANCE WILL 
BE HELL IN UNION SAT.
Evoryono able will of course go to 
Detroit, but thoro will probably bo 
many who cannot. If you aro ono of 
tliia unlucky mob, do not sit and mopo 
at home. Thero will be consolation 
at the Union for evoryono.
The Tartana are going to entertain 
for the usual throe hours ao you know 
what you will mlas if you are not 
there. By the time the dance atarta, 
the acore will bo In from Detroit, and 
of course wild hilarity can be best 
expreased by graceful shaking of the 
feet.
Come and join the great Plaid ag
gregation for its going to be a won
derful dance. Everything is harmon
ious; the chaperones, Mr. and Mrs. 
Brown, Mr. and Mrs. Lang, Mr. and 
Mrs. Staley, are already chosen; tho 
Tartans have agreed to outdo them
selves, in fact, everything Is settled.
Only one dollar and twenty-five 
cents stands between you and the best 
time you ever had. In a case like 
that, delay in making up your mind 
to go, would be superfluous. Of course 
you are going, and so is SHE.
Carnegie Tech football squad has 
another tough proposition to over
come when they tackle the Univer
sity of Detrdit at Detroit next Satur
day. The Tartan griddors have had 
a very successful season so far this 
season but upon meeting anothor 
team almost the equal of W. and J., 
thoy will have to put up a. hard bat
tle.
In thoir game with W. and J. the 
University of Detroit held their op
ponents scoreless until the last few 
minutes of play when the Washing
ton team pushed the pigskin across 
the cluilkllno for a touchdown. De
troit has Carnegie Tech slated as 
one of their hardest games of the 
season and are making due prepara
tions to enter tho clash.
Tlio Skibo squad Is in fairly good 
condition with the exception of a few 
injuries: However, the usual lino of 
dope ia that no predictions will bo 
made, but .lint the Tartans are go
ing to Detroit to tack another victory 
beneath their belts.
There has been no definite action 
taken on a special train to Detroit 
as yot, but If enough students signify 
thoir desire to go at the price given 
at tho pop mooting arrangement!} 
will bo made for a trntln.
It Is understood that tho Michigan 
school has two exceptionally danger

must reckon In proparing for the

In fact, Is oxporioneed and will ofior

FOR A FRIENDLY PITT
Ye Editor received a letter from Prof. 0. W. Sproull .of tlie 
Drawing Department, which, according to our opinion, and of many 
others also, deserves a place in the editorial column. ITis idea is a 
good one, and would be a good one to pul; into operation. This 
statement is not made without careful balancing of the various as
pects which it might bring to the suri'aee, nor without consultation 
with many influential members of the student, administration and 
faculty bodies.
Prolessor Sproull writes:
Now that the Pitt Panther has been tamed, and the pee-radcs, 
dances, etc., all. executed without anything in tlie nature ol! a clash 
with Pitt students having happened, I beg leave In make a sugges
tion which may bo helpful in promoting and sustaining the present 
excellent relationship and true sportsmanship which exist between 
the student bodies of Pitt and Carnegie.
No one ever saw a finer football game than that ol! last Satur
day at Forbes Field. The Pitt team played'good, clean football. The 
Pitt student body showed fine courtesy to Carnegie students.
Last year the students from Pitt appeared on our campus a day 
or two previous to our big gamo with Notro Dame. They said: 
BEAT N'OTKE DAME. They said it over and over. We did not 
beat Notre Dame, but our team carried with them on the field the 
good wishes ol! Pitt.
My suggestion is this: that the Carnegie student body with 
band and cheerleaders appear on, the Pitt campus before ono of the 
big games, and advise the Panther that although wo may enjoy tam
ing liini ourselves, yot wo do noli demro to see others do it.
And this is why wo bolioyo the suggestion a good one.
In tho boginnin'g, why not admit that we are courting Pitts 
favor just as wo boliovo Pitt is courting ours? We are both great 
liollegos in the city ol' Pittsburgh, and therefore are anxious to see 
either ono or tho olihor at tho top ol! tho heap in everything, for 
by so doing it naturally olovatps tlio other. Wo, this yoar, defeated 
tho Pun lil i.ov, and when this snmo Panther defeats everybody elso, it 
imliuinll.y raises our standard a bit higher. A. selfish motive, but just 
the same, are not we nil selfish, more or less? Our motto is: Carnogio 
Tooh first; Pitt socond, and if wo can't; bo first, our desire is to soo 
Pitt first.
So, lot us carry this message to the Pitt cnmpus, and we are sure 
it will add another link to the chain of eordial Ournogio-Pitt rela
tionship, ns mnnillosted itself so wonderfully on tho dcension of our 
footlmll game two weeks ago! hot evoryono ol! us follow Profossor 
Sproull's suggestion and, in n body, march to the Pitt campus, and

Plans for tlie Musical Club trip 
this year huvo almost been com
pleted. A tryout concert is to bo 
held at Mayvlow before taking the 
Xmas trip. Erlo, Buffalo, NorthEast and Corry have been scheduled 
for the week of December 15.
Manager Broudy is also working 
on an Eastern trip scheduled shortly 
aftor Xmas. Tho clubs under Mr. 
Rlohl are practicing very hard 
represent Carnogle Tech at Its best 
at these concerts.
Last Friday evening a quartet from 
tho Girls' Glee Club and ono from 
tho Men's Club sang over KDKA a I 
WestlughouBO. The program, hoard 
byi thousands all over tho country, 
was very good * and the members, 
Miss Cook, Miss Iiehm, AD,, Alen,
I Miss Coploy, Mr, Dixon, Mr. Brondeli, 
Mr. Van Boron and Mr. Lundquiat, 
assisted by Director Mr. Riehl, are 
to ho complimented.
Last Sunduy at the Sixth Presby
terian Church, tho Mens' Glee Club 
sang. Carnegie Tech Night waB well 
attended tlioro and the hospitality of 
tlio church people will not be soon 
forgotten.
Mr. W. B. Cunningham has been 
elected prosidont of the Musical 
Clubs. Mr. Louis L. Turcotte, who 
had been with the clubs for three 
years resigned last week. The club re
grets tho loss of such an able and 
faithful wm-ker as Mr. Turcotte.
A complete schedule of concerts 
and trips for all Musical Clubs will 
appear in the next issne of The

GIRLS GLEE CLUB WILL 
SING OVER KDKA SOON
We feel that it is unnecessary, to 
ask pardon for continual reference to 
the glorious victory over our friendly 
rivals, Pitt, because such an event is 
not readily forgotten.
As a Iltting memorial, therefore, we 
wonder If It would be entirely amiss 
or too far-fetched to suggest that the 
official telephone number at Carnegie 
Tech be changed to Schenley 7266?
Again, wo aro continually reminded 
ol that notoworthy event wherever 
wq may happen to roam by the telltale 
chalk marks, mute evidence of the 
desire of an overjoyed student body 
to tell the world. Yea, verily, wo 
are yet reminded of another glorious 
triumph of years not so long past, by 
somewhat obscure chalk marks having 
a value of 0 to 0.
Along this line it should be urged 
that some other means of commemo
rating notable events be adopted. 'TIs

MARGARET MORRISON
Margaret Morrison Carnogio Col
lege was greatly honored by having 
Bishop Thomas F. Gailor to speak at 
Assembly last week. Thos. F. Gailor 
is the presiding bishop of tho National 
Episcopal Church, and is also Chan
cellor of the University of the South 
at Sewanee.
He proved to be a very interesting 
speaker, and his subject was "The
Worthwhile Things in Life." The 
point he stressed particularly was 
that everyone must seek and appre
ciate truth In llfo, and that the things 
worth having aro not gained without 
struggle.
The attendance at Assembly was 
good, but not as good ns It should 
have boon. This was probably caused 
by tho fact that a notice of Bishop 
Gallov's coming was to appear in the 
last Issue of Tartan, but through some 
error it was not printed.

an occurrence which took place to 
day, that we think is worthy of 
comment and should not go un
noticed.
During the demonstration by the 
students in the parading of the city, 
they came in contact with a funeral 
procession on the way to the ceme
tery, and upon merely the raising of 
the hand of the writer, the leader of [ 
the band raised his baton, all music 
ceaBed, all heads bared, and the 
marchers remained at attention un
til the funeral procssion had passed 
out of sight.
So seldom is the proper respect 
shown on such occasions, that the 
un-usualness of it prompts us to 
bring it to the public attention, in I 
the hope that it will be more prac-| 
ticed. Will you then kindly thank 
the student body.
Most respectfully,

Science Plebe Discovers Or
chestra in Arts
In last weeks Tartan there ap* 
peared a notice concerning the sched
ule of concerts to be given this year 
by the Carnegie Symphony Orchestra. 
Who beside the students in the mu
sic department in Arts College knew 
Carnegie had such an orchestra?
A Plebe came to Carnegie this year, 
along with many others, and entered 
the Science School. Ono of the pe
culiarities which tills particular Plebe 
possessed was an aesthetic side to an 
otherwise scientific nature. Plebe 
played a fiddle and had heard that 
Carnegie boasted of its symphony 
orchestra. Very well! He decided 
that he wanted to become a member 
of tho orchestra even though not a 
music student.
First came the announcement that 
tho band had started rehearsals. Then 
tlio musical clubs started off with a 
bang. Plebe patiently watching all 
bulletin boards and the Tartan for 
tlio notice that would toll him that 
tho Carnegie orchestra had started re
hearsals. Presently this Plebe grew 
a little tired of waiting and began to 
inquire of upper classmen what they 
knew about the organization. Inquiry 
developed the fact that no one seemed 
to know anything of a definite nature 
about Carnegie's own symphony orch
estra!
Not altogether discouraged, how
ever, tills Plebe ono day wandered 
into tho Arts Building and found that 
tho orchestra was not wholly a myth 
and. that sometimes men from Sci
ence School received places in the or
ganization. Thus encouraged Plebe 
did not let the matter rest until he 
got the place as fiddler which he 
wanted. Furthermore, the Plebe was 
not content until lie had received a 
promise of co-operation from Mr. J. 
Vick OBrien, conductor of the orch
estra, and the music department to 
help let Carnegie students know more 
about the orchestra. And that Plebe 
is out to put the Carnegie Symphony 
Orchestra on the map.
Upper classmen take it from a 
Plebeget posted!

Method Used in Opening 
New Coal Mines Outlined
The engineer is the only man 
who is supposed to be infallible. 
This remark was made by Mr. Wm. 
A. Weldin in describing the open
ing of a coal mine before the Civil 
Seminar last Wednesday. Mr. Weldin, 
of Blum, Weldin and Company, En
gineers and Surveyors, has had con
siderable experience in engineering 
work, particularly in the installation 
of mining and industrial plants.
The first thing to do in opening 
a coal mine is to determine the lie 
or posture of the coal. This is done 
by study of government geodetic sur
vey maps and diamond ore drillings. 
The relation of the vein to the sur
face of the ground will decide the 
kind of mine, whether drift, slope or 
shaft. Convenience to a shipping 
point is also of importance in de
termining where the opening shall 
be. Accuracy in running survey 
linos is of the utmost importance in 
this work.
Mr. Weldin used numerous slides 
in illustrating his talk, which was 
very interesting.

A CHANCE TO SHOW SOME REAL SPIRIT
Everybody was feeling kind of discouraged last Saturday evening after I 
' the encounter with Lehigh University. For the second time this season, it 1 
seemed that Dame Fortune had deserted the good ship Skibo and was grac-| 
ing the other frigates deck.
The men on the team were downhearted that night at the result of the j 
game. And why not? The previous week they had seemed unbeatable. But ; 
football machines are human, and subject to all the curious twists which 
human nature experiences. After a superhuman effort, it is only in keeping 
with the law of averages that a slump should follow. If the team was over; 
confident, that feeling was knocked out in the first quarter.
NOW IS THE CHANCE FOR THE STUDENTS TO SHOW THEIR BEST I 
SPIRIT. Carnegie lost, but is not disheartened. The team is preparing for | 
two more gruelling battles. The success of the squads come-back will depend upon the support which the1 student body gives itand we have no 
fears about that.
There will be no crying over spilled milk. We know the boys will give 
all they have without a whimper. They always have. And that is the chief 
reason why, in defeat or victory, the student body, to a man, is behind the 
team.
Did you notice Saturday that when the Tartans were trailing the cheer
ing was louder and better than before? Did you notice that the student 
stands remained filled until the very last blast of the official's whistle? We 
are proud of the team and the student body.

THE TENNIS TOURNAMENT
What has happened to the tennis tournament? From all appearances 
now it seems as though shelters will soon have to be built for the players 
in the finals unless the management speeds things up a bit.
CARNEGIE AND PITT
We can sympathize with Pitt somewhat now after the Lehigh 
However figures will win no game.
AN IDEA FROM THE FACULTY
In case you are not in the habit of reading editorials, let us advise you 
to turn to the editorial column to the item headed, For a Friendly Pitt. It 
will tell you of an idea which Prof. C. W. Sproull sent to the editor, and 
which looks mighty good to us. Professor Sproulls idea, in brief, is to re
turn the compliment which the Pitt students expended to us last year when 
they all pulled for us to win over Notre Dame. The suggestion is that we 
march with the band and cheer leaders, across the Pitt campus and let them 
know that we want them to beat W. & J. and Penn State. Read the edi
torial, and then talk.
Maybe it could be worked as follows: Tuesday at 11:30, instead of
having assembly, the student body could assemble with the band and invade 
the Pitt campus with our friendly mission.
Finally, we wish to thank Mr. Sproull for .his interest. May many more 
members of the faculty become imbued with the idea that the Carnegie Tar
tan is a co-operative publication, FOR THE GOOD OF CARNEGIE.
COME AGAIN, DADS
The best idea since Campus Week was started several years ago was 
put through Saturday in the form of Fathers Day. The parents will go 
home and tell about the good time they had visiting son and daughter at 
college. Carnegie will get some mighty good advertising and some more 
mighty good men and women.
Let us hope that Fathers Day (or why not call it Parents Day?) may 
become a permanent tradition, and grow from this auspicious start into one 
of the schools best traditions.
Incidentally, Mr. G. L. Tilbrook was the power behind the movement and 
is to be congratulated for the success of his idea. Mr. Tilbrook was aided 
by a student committee and it is planned in the future to make the occa
sion entirely a student affair.
DETROIT MUST BE DEFEATED
The Detroit game now looms big and formbidable on the horizon. 
Whether or not she is conquered depends largely on the student support. If 
two hundred sign up to go at the special rate, the administration will send 
the band. Think what some musio and cheering will mean to the team on 
a hostile field, then tell Buddy Overend you want to,go to Detroit. Thats 
all till next week.

OPEN EVENINGS
On Friday afternoon, the Plebe 
team went down to Saltsburg and 
were defeated in a hard-fought game 
with the strong Iviski eleven by the 
score of 19-0.
Not much can be said about the 
game except that the performance of 
the yearlings was partly due to a 
natural slump resultiug from a fuel
ing of over-confidence after the great 
fight against the Panther Cubs the 
previous Saturday. They played in 
spurts. Kiski, on the other hand, by 
hard, consistent and straight football 
mixed with a few short passes, played 
like veterans and deserved their vic
tory.
Kiskis line outweighed that of the 
Plebes, but the backfields of the two 
were evenly matched in weight. The 
Plaid warriors had one chance to 
score. The ball was on Kiskis 5-yard 
line, it was the fourth down and 2 
yards to go. The play was called, but 
the enemy line held and the ball went 
to them on downs.
Then, to show what the Plebes 
could do when pressed, they held Kis
ki for downs on the one-yard line. The 
absence of student support on a
strange field no doubt had much to do
with tlie defeat. The Plebe lineup:

Detroit, a special train will be run, 
and the administration will send the

by the flivver and other high grade

If you are interested, hand your

The members of the ..Rifle Club aro 
devoting the majority of their atten
tion this week to the riflo tournament, 
which is now well under way. This 
will be of three weeks duration, the 
winners receiving gold and silver med
als. Interest is centered in the tour
nament mainly because those who 
qualify will be picked as members of 
the team.
Three of last years toam are back, 
leaving seven places lo bo filled, 
thereby insuring ample opportunity 
for all candidates to demonstrate their 
prowess. Though an official coach is 
lacking, former members are proving 
efficient instructors and no trouble is 
anticipated on that score. The man
agement has arranged for a schedule 
of ten matches, although the dates 
are still tentative. Among the collego 
teams to be met are those of Syra
cuse, Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and Drexel Institute.
A committee of the Riflo Club is 
now striving to obtain recognition of 
the team by the Athletic Council, in 
order to secure letter awards to mem
bers of the rifle team. It is hoped 
that its efforts will be successful as 
this will form ah added inducement 
for men to try for the team.
The first meet of the season for 
the Tartan harriers was held Satur
day against Lehigh and Cincinnati. 
The Lehigh squad won the. meet by 
one point, making it a double vic
tory for their school.
The run started at the bottom of 
Flagstaff Hill at 2: IS. The course 
was covered twice and ended ip 
Forbes Field in order that all could 
see the finish. Dykeman led the 
runners the first time around tho 
course with Bright a close second, 
with a large lead ovor tho other 
runners, but as the run ended a 
different order was taken. Dykeman 
came in first, making the run in 
twenty-eight minutes and thirty sec
onds, a minute and a half better,than 
the second man. The time of the 
first ten men is as follows: Dyke
man, 2S: 30*; Siegmund, captain ol 
Lehigh, 30:05; Hlelter, Cincinnati, 
30:28; Porter, Lehigh, 30:35; Deny, 
Cincinnati, 30:41; Abaechorli, Cincin
nati, 30:54; Hendorer, Tech, 30:57; 
Bender, Tech, 31:03; Ralne, Lehigh, 
31:15; Maxwell, Lehigh, 31:153.
Bright has been running a close 
second to Dykeman, but being trou
bled in his running Saturday, he 
failed to place whore ho was expect
ed to. The final scores were: Le
high, 38; Carnegie, 39; Cincinnati, 
49.
Tho Freshman cross country toam 
won from tho Sacred Heart High 
School Wednesday afternoon. Tho 
moot started at tho bottom of Flag
staff Hill at 5:10, and. covered tho 
regular course, ending in the same 
place% The time of each man Is as 
follows: Wandoll, S. II., 13:40;
Stuits, Tech, 13:41; McKinney, ToUi, 
16:27; De Jesus, Tech, 14:49; Ken
nedy, Tech, 15:18; Kingsley, S. II., 
15:30; Spellman, S. H, 15:35; Car
ter, Tech, 13:45; Oosforlo, S. H., and 
Brasher, S. H. Tho final score was: 
Carnegie 22, and Sacred Heart 33.
The Varsity have a scheduled 
meet with Alfred Collego. This meet, 
is to bo held, at Allred November 9. 
The Freshmen also have a moot this 
week, to be run Thursday1 evening, 
at 4:30.
Prospects for the coming varsity 
I basket ball season are unusually 
j bright. The veteran backbone of tho 
I team is eligible and new stars in 
I sight.
| Carnegie has lost two good llooi*- 
men in Donahue and Gibson. DonaI hue did not return this year and 
j Gibson, who performed brilliantly 
| as a guard, has graduated. These 
I two men constitute the main loss to 
j the varsity squad.
! To. mention the vetorans, War 
! Horse Anderson is captain of the 
j squad. As soon as the football seaI son is over Andy will be out on the 
j floor with tho boys. It is a certainty 
that he will prove to be an able 
I floor leader. Last yoar he was nctI ing-oaptain and did remarkably well. 
O. B. Nowman will be on hand and 
everyone knows that O. B. Is a star 
performer on the floor. Midge Mattee will also bo in uniform ready to 
play the fine grade of basket ball for 
whlcli he is noted.
Two Sophomores who did fine 
work on tho varsity last year aro 
Molirman and Mafort. Thoy played 
like veterans last year and this year 
with tlio added advantage of expe
rience they will no doubt be a great 
asset to tho toam. Another boy who 
will be out on the floor this year Is 
Jimmy Robertson. This will be the 
fourth sport in which ho has com
peted for Carnegie Tech. Ho ban 
boon awarded loiters in throe sports. 
Heres luck, Jimmy, make it your 
fourth.

broaks, tho rosult might havo boon 
vastly dlfforont.
To give the roador somo conception 
of the mannor in which tho Carnogio 
boys outplayod thoir rivals It; might 
bo stated that tho visitors iniulo sovon 
first downs against the Skibos twen
ty-one. On sovoral occasions tho Tar
tans startod a grand march up tho 
flold against their heavier oppononts 
that, wan a revelation, llobortson and 
Mofort skirted tho ends, whllo Brum
baugh tore through Lehighs houvy 
lino lllce a flend. In tho second quar
ter the ball was carried to Lohlghn 
one-foot lino. It was boro that tho 
visitors roso to tho hoights and hold 
Just as the whlstlo blow ending tho 
first half. A fow minutes more and 
a score for Carnegie would have boon 
inevitable.
The first touchdown camo In tho 
oponlng quarter aftor an oxchungo of 
Punts. Neither team hud boon able 
to gain consistently. Andorson 
dropped back on tho fourth down to 
tho flfteon-yard lino to punt. The 
pass from center was slightly high, 
and tho over reliable Jimmy let It 
slip through Ills fingers In an attompt 
to get the kick away quickly. He 
recovered tho ball on the eight-yard 
line, whence successive plunges by 
the enemy took it over. Goal was 
kicked and the score stood Lehigh 7, 
Carnegie 0.
The Tartans launched a spectacu
lar attack in the third quarter which 
resulted in a touchdown. It was sim
ilar to the attack they made in the 
second, period when they failed by 
inches to score. Robertson and Mefort tore around the ends and Brum
baugh ploughed through the line for 
large gains.
When it looked as though the Ski
bos would make a touchdown they 
were penalized fifteen yards for hold
ing, and another play lost several 
yards. It was third down and thirty 
yards to go. At this juncture Jimmy 
Robertson tore around end for ten 
yards, following this up with a for
ward pass to Jimmy Anderson which 
gave the Tartans a first down on the 
three-yard line. It took Captain Rob
ertson only one play to carry the 
oval across. At this point Cy Com
forts educated toe would have been 
worth a fortune, but the veteran Com
fort was out of the game with a 
broken rib, sustained in the second 
period, and the extra point which 
meant everything to the home team 
failed to materialize. The score stood 
7 to f> with Lehigh on the long end.
From this time on the Skibos con
tinued to gain more ground than Le
high, but could not get near enough 
to the goal line to score. Tho second 
unfortunate break against tho locals 
was when Lehigh punted from thoir 
twenty-yard line. Tho ball took a 
bad hop and got away from tho Car
negie backs and rolled to tho ton-yard 
line. Only a fow minutes more were 
left to play, so In desperation Pittman, 
threw a long forward pass which was 
Intercepted by Lewin, who ran down 
the right side of the field for a touch
down. Lev/In failed to kick goal, but 
the damage had already been done. 
The game ended soon after.

Tuberculosis League 
To Open Stamp Drive
Student Salesmen to Appear 
Before Xmas Vacation
The Tuberculosis League of Pitts
burgh announces its annual Christ
mas Seal Campaign, which will open 
throughout the city in the near fu
ture. It is, and has been, the custom 
of the league to havo a campaign of 
tills character each year since 1007, 
with the Idea of furthering the work 
of prevontion and cure of tuberculo 
sis In the city and the surrounding 
territory.
A fow of the benefits of tho league 
might well' bo put before tho stu
dents, to show them the line work 
which the league does in and about 
the city. The dispensary service con
stitutes free examination and treat' 
mont, for which the charge is basea 
upon the ability of the patient to 
pay. Private physicians are used to 
make tlio examinations, and an invi
tation Is offered for thom to uso the 
dispensary equipment. The hospital 
In connection with tho dispensary Is 
free, if tlio patient is unable to pay, 
and where tho patient Is able, a 
charge proportionate to tlio ability 
to pay Is made. Ex-sorvlco patient;? 
for whom tho Federal Government 
takes tho charge are also accommo
dated In tho hospitals.
There Is an open air school for 
chlldron who luivo boon recommendod for that treatment by physician, 
Tho work is equivalent to that in 
tho public school, and when tho stu
dent has regained health, admission 
to school hi granted him. The libra
ry service Is In connection with the 
school, and tho librarian will ussomblo material upon rooelpl. of a phono 
call or post card, to ho ready whon 
called 'for, or to be used In tho rend1 
Ing rooms. The material has been a 
great holp In lighting tho tuberculo
sis In Pittsburgh.
There is a bureau of statistics 
which furnished material not only 
on tuberculosis, but also data on gen
eral questions of public health which 
underlie that disease. This service 
is available by mail or personal vis
it. To Investigate the statute, the 
Industrial Bureau has been devised, 
which consists of a doctor and nurse, 
with free uso of the X-ray. This 
unit moves from plant to plant to 
offer its services. Mobile clinics 
are advised, and arrangements are 
made with the league. In direct 
connection with these branches of 
the service, there is the Technical 
Education and the General Education 
Services, which offer courses to any 
one who may be interested in the 
causes, cure, and treatment of the 
disease. Laboratory service is, avail
able in case it is desired. The bu
reau has a farm to which part of 
the patients are sent, in hope of 
their return to normalcy.
The sale of Christmas Seals is car
ried on as a national campaign and 
the Tuberculosis League is merely a 
local branch of the National Asso
ciation, It is hoped that the stu
dents of Carnegie Tech will take in
terest enough in th matter to inau
gurate a campus branch to sell sen Is 
around the school.
ADVERTISE AND GET RESULTS
ALUMNI TO GATHER 
FOR DETROIT GAME
Hard Battle Anticipated With 
Powerful Eleven Which 
Tartans Meet Sat.
This Is for the special benefit of 
the Alumni from the western part 
of the country.
You read in last weeks Tartan 
what happened to Pitt when they 
tried .to open for the Scotch, dldht 
you? You read about the scare they 
had down in Little Washington the 
woek before that, didnt you? You 
saw what Detroit showed Wash-Jeff 
last week too, didn't you?
Well then, how come .that some of 
you are not going to the home of 
the Fords next Saturday? Oh, we 
know you are needed at the office, 
and that the wife wont let you go, 
and all. the rest, but, seriously, how 
can you sit still when you have a 
chance to see the team which ful
filled the dreams of all your under
graduate day's, play against a team 
that is scheduled to tie Carnegie.
You surely have not yet .become so 
old that you cannot get up enthu
siasm for a football game. Car
negie will beat them without you, 
but oh, what a grand and glorious 
feeling, it will be for you to' see 
Jimmy Robertson go around the end, 
or Cy kicking a field goal, or New
man heaving a forward pass for 
fifty yards into the hands of An
derson, or whoever it happens to be, 
and the rest of the gang will be 
there, as well as Dean Munhall and 
Judge Steffen, the hero of the hour. 
Also, a whole mob of ambitious un
dergrads are going to buy, beg, borrow 
or steal a ride. Think it over. After 
all, is everything as important as 
you think it is?
The strong Detroit Clan will be 
at the game in a body and will ho 
glad to see you there. You rememher that first Maggie you had a, date 
with? Who knows but that she 
might be there unattended and 
ready for another date. This is an. 
opportunity of a lifetime, for the 
alumni of the Middle West to get 
together and see one of Carnegie's 
hardest games.
It will do your heart good, as well 
as your lungs.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
Fifteen Years Ago
Three thousand two hundred and 
j twenty-nine people saw Pitt defeat 
Carnegie in a bard game, 22 to 0.

(Eds. Note: Ten days ago 32,299 
people saw Carnegie defeat Pitt.

GIRLS THAT DO THEIR DUTY
MAY WIN CUP FOR BEAUTY
(Continued From Page One.) 
Nice, you say? Sure, it is, and why 
shouldnt your picture adorn the book 
rather than little Nellie Kellies who 
Isnt good looking at all but just had 
tlio nerve to send hers in?
To our mind the thing resolves itsolf into something like this. Every 
girl will have to have her picture 
taken at sometime or other so why 
not learn to mako those goo-goo eyes 
at tho camora man, now that you're 
old enough to know that the birdie 
wont bite. Wo havo it on good auth
ority that if mamma isnt hero to hold 
your hand during tho ordeal thero are 
somo two thousand men in school 
who aro only too willing to take mam
ma's placo for a fow minutes (who 
said hours?) Then again, dont bo 
afraid that pooplo will think you aro 
concoltod if you outer tho lists. No 
ono Is goliiR to know about it but tho 
Thistle roprosontutlvG and getting inTo from him will ho lllco trying to 
borrow a. clgnrot from Carrie Chap
man Qtttt.
Thoro's tho possibility of winning 
tho wholo works with no more offort 
than giving your sweetie Ills first 
good night ldss. Every girl, wo aro 
told, harbors an ambition to see hersolf in the movies or behind the foot
lights. To be recognized as good look
ing one must attract attention and 
what better opportunity is there than 
having a famous artist look at your 
picture? And if you winthe world 
with a little green fence around it 
(red, blue, violet and ultramarine 
fences also in stock) is yours. Why 
not \talce the chance? What, you 
dont want to get on the stage or in 
the movies! Well, dont cry, little 
girl, you dont have toyou can en
ter the contest anyway.
Maggie had a pretty face,
She had her picture taken.
She won the prize and now throws
pies,
Instead of frying bacon.

ACTUAL BEAUTY CONTEST
DOPE READY AT LAST
(Continued From Page One.)
It is the purpose of the editor to 
have all of the girls in Carnegie Tech 
enter into tlie contest, and to make 
a real thing on the campus. The 
Thistle is the organization back of all 
of the idea, and it is through the 
Thistle that the editor works. The 
idea is thisin a nut shelland only 
this. Each girl is asked to have her 
picture taken by the Thistle photog
rapher, who will print tlio pictures on 
the same kind of paper with the same 
finish, to make it more of an even 
chance on beauty and not photogra
phy. When all the pictures have been 
taken, the Art School faculty will 
pick the 75 most attractive pictures 
from the entire number, and these 
will be sent to the various judges for 
final judgment. There will be six win
ners, each judge picking the six which 
lie thinks are the most beautiful, and 
then when the pictures are sent back, 
the one which has been picked by all 
three judges will be the winner, and 
the res^ of the six will be taken by 
consideration of the three judges; The 
six winners will be awarded prizes, 
and thoir pictures will appear on sep
arate pagos of tho Thistle.
It. Is up to the girls to make tills 
thing go or to put it under. Somo 
may fool that It gives too much pub
licity, and others may fool that they 
have no chance. Thero is no public
ity connected with it, aside from our 
campus publicity, and evoryono knows 
who the prettiest girl is on our cam
pus anyhow. Every girl has an equal 
chance with every otliqr girl, and that 
is where the contest part of the affair 
comes in. Talk'it up, girls, and help 
the Thistle make something of this 
idea, which is entirely new on our 
campus. There is no use waiting for 
the other girl to start, YOU must do 
it!

Recently the Industrial Board of 
Pennsylvania, of which Dean Conelly was the chairman previous to 
his 'appointment as Director of the 
Department of Industrial Relations 
at Carnegie, published a report on 
Industrial iHome Work in Pennsyl
vania. This report is the direct re
sult of work done by one of the 
members of the Margaret Morrison 
Faculty, Dr. Mary Hadden Byrnes.
Miss Bymes in seeking a subject 
for her thesis for the doctors de
gree became interested in the condi
tions which exist in Pittsburgh, and 
other cities in Pennsylvania, and j 
made these the subject of her thesis. 
The Industrial Board was found 
ready to cooperate with Miss Byrnes, 
and was so astounded by the com
pleteness of the-report and the con
ditions revealed that a large number 
of rulings and laws have been made 
on the basis of that report.
After Miss Byrnes was granted the 
degree of Ph. D., the college author
ities at Bryn Mawr were requested 
to allow the Industrial Board to pub
lish the thesis as a whole. Conse
quently the report has now been 
made public and anyone interested 
in the subject will find mighty inter
esting readilng there. Few people 
realize the extent to which this evil 
still exists in the larger cities, and I 
in the country as well. Carnegie is | 
very proud to have Mis^ Byrnes on 
her faculty.
In the Boston Transcript of Octo
ber 18, a news article contains thfc 
following item of interest to alumni 
and friends of Carnegie:
Mayor Curley of Boston this morn
ing approved the appointment of 
four men to the City Planning De
partment. Boston in common with 
many other large cities has begun 
a campaign for more scientific 
housebuilding on street layingout. The mayor asserted that 
the department is studying a Lay
out of the city1 for the next twentyfive years or more, with a special 
view to street-widening projects 
which would relieve traffic conges
tion.
One of the four men is Mr. Glenn 
Hall, who received his degree from 
the Department of Architecture, and 
who is now taking ai special course 
at Harvard University*. Since leav
ing -Carnegie Mr. Hall has taken a 
special course in the Beaux-Arts In
stitute of Design and has had nine 
years practical experience in civil  
engineering and mining. Mr. Halls 
fellow workers are Ohio and Iowa

A recent issue of a Miama, Florida, 
newspaper contained an article from 
which the following are extracts:
After finishing a course in sheet 
metal work at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology H. RBohnert permanetly joined his father in the Bohnert 
Sheet Metal and Roofing Company, in 
September, 1918. S'ince that time the 
business has more than doubled and 
many of the most notable buildings 
under construction in Miami shows 
the work of this rapidly growing firm. 
These buildings include the Scottish 
Rite Cathedral, where one mile of 
ventilating pipe alone is put in; the 
Catholic church for which seven tons 
of copper is being made into cornice; 
and the Bank of Biscayne building 
where a membranous waterproofing 
is being put into the excavation.
Altogether the company has now 
over 58,000 square feet of roofing un
