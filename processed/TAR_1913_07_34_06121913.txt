Saturday, June 7, was certainly an 
off-day for the Varsity, and West Vir
ginia Wesleyan had an easy time 
winning, 10 runs to 2. Our boys 
played inconsistently and loosely, and 
the game had no apparent likeness to 
the brand that they have been playing 
all season. Such a session is almost 
sure to occur at least once in a year, 
and we were saved some of the sting 
of defeat by losing to such local cham
pions as the West Virginians. But 
when a team gets ten runs from thir
teen hits and their opponents gather 
but two runs on twelve bingles,' the 
first team is playing good ball and 
the second is about as poor as it 
would be possible for Carnegie Tech 
to be.
No special blame can be placed, as 
almost every one of our players 
showed brief flashes of old-time pep, 
but one by one slumped back into the 
hole. Captain Gearhart started the 
first two innings as if he meant to 
play the game alone. He threw out 
the first four men from difficult field
ing chances. Vail and De Muth did 
some great work in the outfield, and 
were kept busy chasing the long ones.
Wesleyan, besides hitting often, hit 
hard. They pounded out four twobaggers and a triple. Toothman and 
Curtis each had three bingles, one of 
which in each case was a double. 
Lamberts two hits were both for ex
tra bases, and Neal was responsible 
for a single and a triple.
Wesleyan started the scoring in the 
first. Gearhart threw out Reader, 
after a spectacular stop of a hard hit 
drive. Toothman hit into the wires 
for two bases, and. went to third on 
Curtis sacrifice to Gearhart. Urquhart pitched a low one that escaped 
Lain, and Toothman scored. Gear
hart continued his spectacular work 
by breaking down Lamberts line 
drive and throwing the latter out.
The third inning was a night-mare 
for the Techites. Hall made a fine 
catch of Peerys foul fly. Readers 
hit got away from Moorhead and he 
stole second. When Toothman hit to 
right, Reader scored and Toothman 
took second on the throw home. Cur
tis sent Toothman to third by a single, 
then stole second himself. Lambert 
drove the ball to the bluff, scoring 
the two men ahead of him and reach
ing second safely. Neal sent a high 
one to Vail. Smith landed safe on q 
bingle to right and went to second
TENNIS SEASON OVER.
With last Saturdays match with 
Wrestinghouse the tennis season of 
1913 came to an end. The season was 
not as successful as was hoped for 
but better things are in store for us 
next year. Four matches were played, 
only one of which Tech won.
The team was handicapped by the 
lack of good courts on which to prac
tice on the school property. Two 
courts are not nearly sufficient for 
the faculty to play on let alone the 
student body and T:he team. Through 
the kindness of Mr. Nelson, permis
sion to practice on the Field Club 
courts was received, but on account 
of their distance from the Sc-h'ools 
and the limited time the team had to 
play tennis, this privilege was not 
made use of as often as the men de 
sired. A backward and stormy spring 
also prevented many a days practice
Having hardly had a racket in their 
hands the team put up a good fight 
against Grove City but lost the match
4 to 2. State, with a superior team 
defeated the team next, 4 to 2. Tech 
was in form when they played W. & 
J. and defeated them easily, 4 to 1 
The last match was lost to Westing 
house with a team made up largely 
of substitutes, 4 to 3.
Return matches were scheduled 
with Grove City and W. & J., but on 
account of wet courts these matches 
were not played. Thus we were de
prived of a chance to at least tie the 
seasons matches, for W. & J. was 
easy and Grove City would have had 
to play far better tennis than they 
showed in the first match to repeat the 
defeat they gave us.
Manager Beeken had troubles dur 
ing the entire season, and only through 
inclement weather were we prevented 
from having at least two trips with r 
couple more victories. He worked 
hard for the team, giving a dance 
early in the spring in order to make 
enough money to make these trips 
possible. Only priise can be given 
him for the way he handled the team
E. E. Duff has played his last match 
for Tech. He was the standby of the 
team for three years and has won the 
great majority of his matches. He 
played Number 1 on this years team 
and more than did his part. Captain 
Douthett played Number 2 and to his 
work many of our victories are due 
He won three of his four matches 
Manager Beeken played Number 3 
and was as steady and aggressive as 
before. His steady work helps to give
C. I. T. LOSES HARD 
TENNIS MATCH
TECH LOSES TRACK 
MEET TO STATE.
On the courts of the Westinghouse 
Club the Carnegie Tennis Team went 
down to defeat at the hands of that 
club last Saturday. The score was 4 
to 3. Captain Douthett and Duff were 
the only regulars playing the rest of 
the team being made up of substitutes 
With the exception of Douthett the 
team played below form. This was 
doubtless due to the lack of practice 
during the week.
Douthett and Duff were responsible 
for all of the victories, winning in both 
singles and doubles. Miller, Henning 
and Wilson were unable to take ? 
match. The future of the meet was 
the match between Douthett and Aid 
en. This v/as a three-set affair and was 
fast from beginning to end, Douthett 
finally winning. Duff played his match 
for Carnegie and won in straight sets 
without extending himself very much
With the score 3 to 3, the deciding 
match was played between Milller 
and Wilson vs. Spooner and Wynne 
This was a long-drawn out and close 
battle. With a set apiece the score 
went to 8 all. At this point Tech 
weakened and Westinghouse won, 1C 
to 8.
The scores were as follows:
Duff defeated Hayes, 6-3, 7-5; Dou
thett defeated Alden, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5; Mil 
ler lost to Graham, 3^6, 6-8; Wilson 
lost to Spooner, 6-2, 6-1; Henning lost 
to Wynne, 6-2, 6-3. DoublesDuff 
and Douthett defeated Alden and 
Hayes, 6-4, 8-6; Miller and Wilson

8-10.
CARNEGIE SERVICE 
COMMITTEE.
On Friday last, a general commit
tee, representing the various activi
ties and fraternities in school, met in 
the Club Room, and organized them
selves for the purpose of taking up 
some form of service which would be 
of benefit to those who need help. The 
organizations represented were: The 
Seannachie, The Student Activities 
Committee, The Tartan, and several 
of the fraternities. Mr. Lockwood 
and Mr. McCorkle also met with the 
committee. It is understood that all 
of the fraternities wnll send represent
atives and all of the activities not 
already represented will also co-oper
ate in the work.
The name of the committee, it was
Two Records Broken.
Penn State defeated Tech last Mon
day afternoon at State College by the 
score of 93% to 18% points. Though 
apparently one-sided, the final result 
is no indication of the actual struggle. 
The Plaid runners fought hard and 
in two cases, compelled their oppo
nents to establish new records to 
win.
Leiden of State lowered the Penn 
State record in the half-mile from 2 
minutes 13.5 seconds to 1 minute 59- 
2-5 seconds. Hammitt of State set 
a new Penn State mark of 25 seconds 
in the low hurdles, clipping 4-5 second 
from the former record. Capt. Craw
ford took second in this, his last race 
for Tech, and covered himself with 
glory by a remarkable exhibition of 
gameness. After winning the only 
first place made by his team, Chuck 
started out a close second in the low 
hurdles. When half way down the 
stretch, he pulled" a muscle in his 
stomach, that had been strained only 
a short time ago, but gamely contin
ued over the last five hurdles.
The most excit'ug events of the 
meet were the two-mile and quartermile runs. In the former, Kaiser, the 
Penn State intercollegiate star, set the 
pace with Haseltine of Tech at his 
heels. The pair were together till the 
final lap, when Haseltine endeavored 
to take the lead. But he started to 
sprint too soon and was unable to 
overtake his more experienced oppo
nent. A similar finish occurred in the 
440-yard dash. Mayer of Tech was 
running third at the final stretch when 
he began to gain on the leaders. He 
started just too late, however, and lost 
first place by a few inches. Dunsieth, 
a plebe in the Industry school, ran 
his best race of the season, finishing 
third in this event.
Murphy and Wright w^ere the other 
Tech men to place, Murphy taking 
second in the high jump and Wright 
tying for second in the pole vault. The

CARNEGIE SERVICE
COMMITTEE.
The Carnegie Service Committee, 
organized last week, certainly deserves 
the support of every student in Car
negie. The work which it hopes to 
carry on will be along the lines of 
social service and settlement work, to
gether with a continuation of the Y. 
M. C. A. movement already started 
among the fraternities.
Feeling that they had a responsi
bility for the welfare of the men and 
boys of this large community, that 
they wanted to serve men, and to disc6ver conditions where the needs of 
men might be observed and helped, 
this committee, representative of the 
whole student body, organized itself. 
Its first task will be to engage the 
co-operation and stimulate the enthu
siasm of all the students. Lack of 
enthusiasm was the cause of the fail
ure of the social-service committee 
appointed last fall, for without the 
loyal support of a good many men, 
little can be done along this line. It 
is to be hoped that the new commit
tee will meet with better assistance, 
and that when it calls for volunteers 
for settlement work, playground work, 
or for leaders for the formation of 
boys clubs, etc., they will be forth
coming. Surely no work could be so 
interesting and self-helpful as that 
among the boys of the mill districts 
of Pittsburgh, teaching them better 
standards of health, better standards 
of housing conditions, how to enjoy 
relaxation which proves a recreation 
rather than a dissipation, and seeking 
all the various ways in which these 
boys may be helped.
When the committee arouses the 
enthusiasm of the students it then 
hopes to proceed with the work, do
ing so probably under the guidance 
of social service workers of long ex
perience.
Such a movement is being carried
on in many of our large cities, and 
its benefit is being more clearly recog
nized every day. The Big Brothers 
movement originated in New York in 
1904 with the purpose of helping boys 
who had been before the childrens 
court. It was there found that more 
than 90 per cent of the delinquents 
were under no adequate parental su
pervision; almost all of them, how
ever, were susceptible to friendly 
sympathy and advice. The aim of the 
Big Brothers is to get the boy inter
ested in something which will develop 
his character, to find fine work in good 
surroundings if he must work, to find 
out where he spends his evenings, to 
get him interested in good reading, 
and good amusements, to teach him, 
standards of health and clean living, 
and above all to be patient with him. 
The Big Brother is of the virile type 
of mansuch as many here at Tech, 
he is able often by his own per
sonality to become a direct influence 
for good in the boys life and an 
indirect influence in the home of the 
boy. The movement has spread won
derfully. It is being carried on in 
Brooklyn, a good start has been made 
in Philadelphia, and the New York 
office reports that it is in correspond
ence with at least thirty cities in the 
country.
This is merely given as an example 
of what the Carnegie Service Com
mittee may hope to accomplish in 
Pittsburgh in conjunction with other 
lines of endeavor. We believe it will 
be a success and we hope it will 
meet with its deserved support.
BLANKET TOSSING.
This institution was started for a 
good reason and well performed its 
purpose. Now, like many other good 
measures, through lack of responsible 
supervision, it seems to be in danger 
of being carried to extremes. All 
those who read the letter in last 
weeks Tartan will admit that the 
protest was timely and justified. Last 
Wednesday another unjustifiable toss
ing took place, being supervised in 
this instance by the Plebes. Strange 
as it may seem, not one of them was 
able to give an adequate reason for 
tossing one of their own men, and in 
tossing a Sophomore their action was 
inexcusable . and the perpetrators 
should be promptly punished. We do 
not believe that this mode of con
demnation should be intrusted to any 
group of irresponsible students, who 
through personal animus or their fool
ish reason desire to disgrace one of 
their fellow class-mates. It is to be 
hoped that the Sennachie Society will 
look into this matter and prevent any 
future occurrences of the kind. If 
any man deserves punishment, let him 
first be judged by a responsible body 
of Seniors and given a chance to de
fend himself. If found guilty, then he 
should be tossed, but only by those 
who are responsible and temperate 
enough to see that no innocent by
stander is pushed on to the blanket 
to furnish amusement for the crowd 
If amusement is desired the sugges
tion in the letter above referred to 
cannot be improved.
CORRESPONDENCE
[The Editors of the Tartan are pleased 
at all 'times to receive communications 
from any member of the Faculty or stu
dent-body upon subjects of timely inter
est. Such articles as are deemed of suf
ficient interest will be published at the 
first opportunity. Anonymous communi
cations cannot be considered, but the 
names of correspondents will be withheld 
when so desired.]

To the Editor of The Tartan:
I am enclosing a copy of a letter I 
received from one Earle R. Marvin 
and a copy of my answer to him. I 
respectfully ask you to print these 
letters in your columns for open com
munications in order that the student 
body may have all the facts at hand 
concerning the case in question.
Yours very truly, 
DONALD D. MITCHELL.
The letter of Earle R. Marvin to
Donald D. Mitchell
Pittsburgh, Pa., June 4, 1913. 
Mr. D. D. Mitchell,
Editor in Chief of The Tartan, 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Sir:
As an occasional advertiser in, and 
one interested concerning the Insti
tute of Technology, the Tartan fre
quently comes to my notice. In a 
recent issue I saw copy of extract 
from a private printed letter known 
as Pi Crust of Theta Xi which was 
published under Open Correspond
ence received by the Tartan, and 
I note your editorial comment upon 
it.
As a member of Theta Xi Frater
nity, Beta Chapter at Yale, 1896, and 
being familiar with inter-fraternal 
courtesies and customs, it would in
terest me to know what code of honor 
prompted you, as an editor, to pub
lish an extract from a private printed 
copy of a personal letter, which under 
ordinary business and social condi
tions is regarded as sacred between 
sender and receiver, and if through 
mishap the letter should be lost, I 
have always considered it a gentle
mans most sacred duty to return it 
unopened and unread. Your editorial 
comment on the communication, open
ly asking the students to take notice 
of the contents of private correspond
ence places upon you the necessity of 
explaining your attitude and views in 
regard to this particular matter.
I am not writing you this letter for 
publication. It is a private communi
cation; although if you wish to pub
lish it I will certainly have no ob
jections. I wish to make myself plain 
that I make no mention regarding the 
contentsof the extract from Pi 
Crust that you printed. This is not 
the point I ask you to explain, but I 
ask you distinctly to explain what atti
tude you have toward reading and 
publishing correspondence that was 
not intended for you or addressed to 
you but was of strictly private char
acter. Certainly I give you the bene
fit of the doubt, as it is to my mind 
almost incomprehensible that an edi
tor should possess the soul of a prying 
servant or the sneaking proclivities 
of a smug yokel. You will find me at 
my office, 5850 Center avenue, if you 
do not care to reply to this communi
cation in writing.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) EARL R. MARVIN.
The answer of Donald D. Mitchell to 
the above letter from Earle R. Mar
vin
June 7th, 1913. 
Mr. Earle R. Marvin,
5850 Center Avenue,
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Sir:
Your letter of June 4th received 
and the contents carefully noted. (I 
was especially pleased to read that 
you were extending to me the benefit 
of the doubt. Such consideration is 
more than one would naturally expect 
to receive after reading your letter.)
Before we enter at all into the dis
cussion of the facts of the case, I 
want you to distinctly understand that 
I am under no obligation or necessity 
of explaining my attitude to you. The 
members of the Pi Chapter of Theta 
Xi might possibly have grounds to ask 
me how the copy of the Pi Crust 
became public. But as for you, it is 
most decidedly none of your business 
why I, as Editor-in-Chief of The Tar
tan, wrote or printed any article what
soever just as long as you were not 
personally mentioned and concerned. 
I am, however, going to tell you how 
the copy of the Pi Crust escaped 
from the inner shrine of the fraternity 
and became public property in order 
that all the facts may be known, and 
to that end I reserve the right to ask 
Mr. Gilson, the Editor-in-Chief of the 
Tartan, to publish your letter to me 
and my answer to you.
The true sequence of mishaps by 
which the copy of the Pi Crust be
came public property are as follows: 
A member of Pi Chapter of Theta Xi 
was reading the sheet in a general 
lecture of the School of Applied Sci
ence. Upon finishing he handed it 
over to a non-member with the re
mark, Do you want to read this? 
This made the sheet public property 
and as such it was passed around in 
exactly the same manner the Theta 
Xi man had first passed it to the non
member. In the course of its travels 
it reached the Seanna!chie Society, 
and you know as well as I do the ac
tion taken by that body upon the ma
licious lies printed in the Pi Crust 
concerning the Seannachies course in 
regard to the election of N. G. Parry 
as Track Manager. You must admit, 
if you are the reasonable man you 
state yourself to be, that the action of 
the Seannachie and The Tartan was 
only just and for the best interests of 
the student-body at large and their 
Athletic Association. It is indeed for
tunate that there exists at the Insti
tute a body of men who are honest 
enough and courageous enough to 
stand against fraternity politics and 
the Railroading of men into office. 
I know nothing of the ideals of Theta 
Xi but I do know that the fact of 
being a national will not give them, 
or any other fraternity, license to

A BAD PRECEDENT.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
To an upperclassman it seems that a 
very bad precedent has been set in allow
ing the Plebes to have use of the blanket. 
This blanket was first, and rightly, used 
by the Seniors of the School of Applied 
Science to awaken some men, and let 
them know that soms of their actions 
were not for the best interests of the 
Schools. It worked well and stopped the 
bad practice of eating in the locker rooms 
and corridors. However of late it has 
fallen into Plebeian hands and used by 
them to toss men of their own class along 
with a man in a higher class. Perhaps all 
these men were rightly punished, but does 
it not seem a little more prudent to keep 
this means of rebuke in the hands of the 
Seniors, who have been in school four 
years, and who should at least have more 
discretion than the Plebes in dealing with 
matters of this kind.
Lets make a toss in the blanket mean 
a rebuke from the upperclassmen, and 
not let it be used without some thought 
and discretion.
Signed,
A. Senior.
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL
ENGINEERING SOCIETY
Another annual banquet has gone 
into history. Five such affairs have 
now been held by the C. M. E. S., and 
of course each has been better than 
any of the preceding. The feast at 
the German Club was a grand affair 
to say the least. Most of the fellows 
will be able to walk around in a few 
days, but the combination of ham 
tongue, Schweitzer, potato salad 
chicken, etc., (and, by the way, there 
are many things included in that et 
cetera) was almost too much for 
some of the fellows who do not keep 
in training by eating at the beanery. 
After a general handshaking and 
pow-wow, the Society held a business 
meeting for the election of officers 
which gave the following result: 
President, J. B. Patterson.
Vice President, J. R. Cline. 
Treasurer, A. H. McGill.
Secretary, W. M. Sheldon.
The Society was then entertained 
by the Industrial Improvement Com
mission of Pittsburgh, an illustrate^ 
lecture with movies constituting 
the entertainment. Great applause
greeted some of the well known 
scenes about Oakland, including pic 
tures of Tech, Forbes Field, Pitts
burgh Athletic Association, Memorial 
Hall and many other notable educa
tional and artistic buildings. Views 
of -the University of Pittsburgh were 
also shown. The men taking the 
Steel Works course were delighted 
to see many of the well known mills 
about Pittsburgh in action. Memor
ies of inspection week were awakened 
and much usefulinformation was gath
ered for exams. At the close of the 
lecture the Society gave a rising vote 
of thanks to the gentlemen who de
voted their time to entertaining us 
for the evening.
During the feed which followed, the 
newly elected officers were called on 
for speeches. All responded to the 
call and from all appearances the So
ciety should prosper well under their 
guidance. Patterson took charge of 
the meeting and called upon some of 
the alumni for experiences. Some 
seemed to have had so much to do 
that they could not select anything 
from their work that they could talk 
on without taking two or three days 
of our valuable time, while others 
seemed to have done nothing inter
esting. At least that is what they said 
but we know they were just afraid 
they would give away trade secrets.
Each one, however, responded with 
a story and many an old chestnut was 
brought out of the incubator. (Dont 
display ignorance by asking what busi
ness a chestnut has in an incubator 
because we dont know.) Stories 
along mechanical lines were told of 
experiences with producer gas and 
air brakes.
After some songs and yells the 
meeting ended with the singing of the 
Piscola song by the Junior Meehan 
icals. The words heard most about 
that time were, Call a taxi.

the entire team confidence. Savage 
and Miller divided the Number 4 posi 
tion each playing two matches. Savage 
played his old dashing game and broke 
even. He played his best when he 
thrashed his W. & J. opponent, twe 
love sets. Miller was unfortunate and 
lost two close matches.
Better things are undoubtedly in 
store for us next year. It is true we 
lose Duff, our best man, but we stil1 
have four men left and a few promis
ing substitutes. Then we will have ai 
least six new courts next year. These 
courts will very likely be ready by 
September, so practice up this sum
mer and enter the fall tournament.
Not To Join Soccer League.
Princeton has definitely decided no" 
to join the Intercollegiate Soccei 
League next year, and the member 
ship of the league will remain the 
same as this year. An invitation to 
join was extended to the Tigers a' 
a recent meeting of the Soccer Asso 
ciation, but the Princeton authorities 
decided that it would be impossible 
for their team to become a member

CAMP.
4
There is an undercurrent of excite
ment and expectation in Margaret 
Morrison even while the classes are 
scheduled for two or more examina
tions a day because the girls are go
ing to Camp Carnegie just as soon 
as school is out.
We are going up on the twenty-fifth 
of June and expect to stay for two 
weeks. We can play tennis but only 
those girls who are able to swim will 
be permitted to go canoeing and go 
in the water.
They will have no rules except those 
made by the girls themselves, with 
the exception of the rule concerning 
swimming and canoeing made by Miss 
Stannert, their chaperon. They have 
decided that everyone must be in bed 
by 10 oclock and get up at 7 or 7:30 
oclock.
The girls, of course, will do their 
own camp-fire cooking. The work is 
to be so divided that each day four 
girls will take charge.
Visitors are not only allowed but 
expected frequently. The motto is 
Come often and stay long.
It was suggested that the girls go 
to Church on Sunday if they are not 
having such a good time that they 
will forget when Sunday comes.
ASSEMBLY.
At Assembly on Monday, June 2nd, 
Dr. Day, head of the Department of 
General Studies, spoke to the stu
dents on Good Citizenship. He said 
that one should not judge people by 
public opinion but should always in
vestigate for themselves, and if that 
could not be done it is then best to 
side with the person being accused. 
To illustrate this principle, Dr. Day 
spoke of the present Heeter trial and 
of the case just settled about Colonel 
Roosevelt being a drunkard. 
CLASS DAY EXERCISES.
On Friday, June 13th, at 2 oclock, 
the Seniors and Tri-Seniors will hold 
their class day exercises on the ath
letic field. Little is known of the 
program but it will in all probability 
be the finest that has ever been given 
by a graduating class. The girls have 
been working hard for several weeks 
with Miss Higgins and Miss Stoner, 
both of whom deserve a great deal of 
credit for drilling the girls so splen
didly.
The program will open with the 
Ivy Oration by Minnie Harris/of the 
Gri Senior class. Every year the 
members of the graduating class try 
for the pin which the Dean of the 
school presents to the girl who wins 
the Ivy Oration contest. This year 
Director Hamerschlag is presenting 
the pin. The honor has fallen to Miss 
Harris and the entire school wishes 
to congratulate her on the excellent 
oration which she has written.
The remainder of the program is a
dark secret and curiosity runs high 
to discover what the Seniors will pos
sibly need with 1,600 square feet of 
stage which is now lined up between 
the athletic field and house on Woodlawn avenue.
BASKETBALL.
For the first time in the history 
of the school there has been a girls 
team in basketball. It was formed 
under the direction of Miss Stoner 
and under her excellent supervision 
developed into a strong and fast team. 
Miss Stoner has permitted the girls 
to play but a few games with teams 
outside of the school. On such oc
casions they showed great ability.
The girls on the team are all un
der class men, so that having worked 
together this year we can look for
ward to a long, successful season for 
next year. The team has played the 
class teams, which games have proved 
very interesting to those attending. 
These games have had an added in
terest because Miss Stoner offered a 
pennant to the winning team of the 
school. The Plebe team was unde
feated during the year, and so won 
this pennant, and it is hoped that 
they will be able to put up a good 
fight for it next year.
FACULTY NOTES.
A number of the faculty are plan
ning to spend the summer studying 
at Columbia University and in this 
list are Miss Cellingham, Mrs. Marron, and Miss Hattie-Merrill.
The teachers of the Biological de
partment are all planning to study 
this summerMiss Mackenzie, at the 
Harvard Medical Municipal Bacteri
ological College; Miss Collette, at the 
Kansas State University; Miss Hay
den, at the Marine Biological Labora
tory, Woods Hole, Md.
Miss Patton and Miss Ernst are go
ing abroad as soon as school closes, 
while Mrs. Vermorcken will sail for 
Europe later in the summer.
At the close of school Miss Higgins 
will leave to become Advisor of 
Women at the Lmiversity of Alabama 
Summer School.
At Chautauqua this summer our 
school will be well represented by 
Miss Bessie Merrill, who will teach 
lace making, and Miss Parry.
Miss Farin and Miss Hanna have 
consented, after much urging, to stay 
for summer school. These are the 
only members of the faculty that have 
consented as yet.
VARSITY SLYUMPS
Continued from Page 1.
when Lain missed the throw to catch 
Lambert at home. Withers, the eighth 
man up, struck out, ending the inning 
after four runs had been tallied. In 
the next five innings, Urquhart al
lowed but two hits and struck out five 
men.
Carnegies first run was made in the 
fifth inning. Moorhead bunted and 
was thrown out by Peery. Gearhart 
singled to middle and took second on
a passed ball. The captain went to 
third when Urquhart hit a single to 
middle. Hall filled the bases by beat
ing out a bunt. Kauffman climbed on 
the wagon with a safety to left, scor
ing Gearhart. Urquhart also tried to 
score but was tagged out at the plate, 
Hall and Kauffman reaching third and 
second respectively on the play. Vails 
bid for a party-buster was caught by 
Singleton.
Everything went to pieces in the 
ninth, and the Wesleyan bunch batted 
around. Three singles, a double and 
a triple, with an error by Urquhart, 
netted five runs.
The last half of the ninth gave us 
the second run. Gearhart hit to Cur
tis and was thrown out. Ridge went 
in as a pinch-hitter for Urquhart but 
missed three. Hall singled to middle 
and went to third on Kauffmans hit 
to the same spot. Vail also hit safely, 
scoring Hall. Kauffman tried to make 
third but was thrown out by Single

JUNIOR MECHANICALS 
GIVE HOME CONCERT'
A sacred concert was given by the 
Junior Mechanical Class of the School 
of Applied Science, Thursday, June 5 
from 1 to 3. It was a very select af
fair, as only the students (?) of that 
class and their instructor were pres
ent. The musicians were lured from 
the back shelves of the Lecture Room 
and stealthily escorted to the Music 
Room. (Not the Carnegie Music Hall) 
where a very fine concert was given 
despite the fact that silver tongues in 
the shape of divider points had to be 
furnished, and the lack of a crank 
was overcome by running the ma 
chine backward to wind them up 
(This shows the advantages of a Me
chanical training.) Although Heinroths artistic soul might have been 
pained by the results, it was an awe 
inspiring example of the possibilities 
of English as she is sung, and the 
Poet, Laureate, of the Mechanicals, is 
now busy revising that old song, Gee 
But I Like Music with My Meals, 
to Gee But I Like Music with My 
Machine Design.
The program of classical music 
which was so beautifully rendered 
(or rended), is given below.
1. Extracts from 23rd Sympathy
By Bakeoven
2. Quartet from Wriggoletta
Composer Unknown
3. A Gay Gosoon (a piccolo solo)
By the Devil, probably
4. Ave Maria (meaning So Long
Mary, By Go Nod
5. Overture to Mid-summer nights
Nightmare Felix Mendelsohn
6. An unrecognizable selection by 
C. I. T. people (Probably the 
Bustin Opera Co.See your 
Thistle.)
7. In My Harem, by the Gayety
Grand Opera Chorus 
At this point the musicians ran 
down and the concert ended with 
great applause. Those present state 
that the concert was only surpassed 
by the annual Home Concert of the 
Musical Clubs.
NEW HYDRAULIC 
LABORATORY DEDICATED.
The dedication exercises of this mag
nificent new building intended for the 
Civils, took place Friday, June 6, at 
high noon, the Junior Mechanicals 
officiating. The affair was witnessed 
by great throngs of people who had 
come from near and far. The people 
from near being the students and 
those from far, the noble Romans 
digging on the bank. The exercises 
consisted mainly of immersion in a 
circular tank, 20 feet in diameter and 
6 feet deep. Clair and Kellar were 
barred because nobody else could get 
in if either of them were there.
The Society Editor of the Tartan 
was unable to be present, as he was 
taking an exam., but it is reported 
that the costumes were wonderful and 
rather difficult to behold.
After pictures had been taken for 
the Carnegie Art Galleries the exer
cises were quickly concluded.

CLAIRE ELECTED 
TRACK CAPTAIN.
Haseltine To Lead Cross-Country 
Team.
At a meeting of the track team held 
Monday evening after the State meet,
E. L. Claire, of Pittsburgh, a member 
of the T4 Science Class, was elected 
captain of the 1914 team, with but one 
dissenting votehis own. Claire has 
been on the team for two years and 
was the logical choice for the posi
tion. He is a consistent winner in 
the weight events and has a pleasing 
personality that has gained for him the 
confidence of the other members of 
the team. Possessing these essential 
qualities of a track captain, he should 
prove a splendid leader.
Anticipating the track work next 
fall, a captain of the cross-country 
team was also chosen. E. R. Hasel
tine, of Saranac Lake, N. Y., a soph
omore in the Design School, was 
unanimously elected to lead the long 
distance runners. With the exception 
of Capt. Crawford, Haseltine scored 
more points than any other member 
of the Tech team and by this excel
lent showing, earned the title con
ferred on him.
The members of the track squad 
broke training Monday evening. While 
the outcome of the meets was not as 
gcod as might be desired, the season 
as a whole was successful in three 
respects: first, in the finding of a 
coach; second, in the improvement 
shown by many of the men who give 
promise of starring next year; and 
third, in the development of a spirit 
of friendliness among the members of 
the team.
BOARD OF CONTROL ELECTS.
At a recent meeting of the Board of 
control, W. F. Routh, 14, was elected 
baseball manager for the 1914 season.
F. M. Pringle, 15, was elected first 
assistant manager for the same sport. 
Wm. Miller, 14, was elected track 
manager for next season.
The tennis team was awarded white 
coat sweaters with the regulation ten
nis letter. The following men have 
been awarded the Varsity C for 
baseball: Capt. J. R. Gearhart, G. E. 
Vail, W. L. Moorhead, R. L. Kirk, 
C. E. Brine, G. D. Lain, R. Hoerr, W. 
W. Hall, and C. W. Lobert.
C. B. Kline was elected press agent 
for the year 1913-14.

ANNUAL BANQUET.
WAR DEPARTMENT TO ES
TABLISH SUMMER CAMPS
Purpose is to Give Students Military 
Training During Vacation.
The Secretary of War has decided 
to hold two experimental military 
camps of instruction for students of 
educational institutions during the 
coming summer vacation period 
Should these camps prove a success 
it is intended to hold them annually 
one in each of the four sections of 
the country.
The object of those camps is, pri
marily. to increase the present inade 
quate personnel of the trained mili 
tary reserve of the United States by 
a class of men from whom, in time o' 
a national emergency, a large propor 
tion of the commissioned officers wil 
probably be drawn, and upon whose 
military judgment at such a time the 
lives of many other men will in < 
measure depend.
The object sought is no in any way 
one of military aggrandizement. bu< 
a means of meeting a vital need con 
fronting a peaceful, unmilitary, though 
war-like nation to preserve that de 
sired peace and prosperity by the bes' 
known precaution, viz., a more thor 
ough preparation and equipment tc 
resist any effort to break such peace 
The plan, in brief, is as follows:
All students over 17 years of age 
and physically qualified volunteering 
for this instruction, and who are prop 
erly recommended by the officer de 
tailed as military instructor at the in 
stitution, or the president of same 
where no such officer is detailed, be 
allowed to participate in the camp of 
instruction under the following pro 
visions:
(a) That their attendance at the 
camp will be for the entire period, un 
less compelled by actual necessity tc 
leave before that time.
(b) That they will render them 
selves during this period subservien' 
to the rules and regulations of mili 
tary discipline the commanding officei 
having authority to discontinue theii 
attendance upon violation thereof.
(c) That the expenses of transporta 
tion to and from camp, cost of uni 
forms needed2 pair of breeches 
khaki, hat, leggins, O. D. shirt (aboir 
$5 per man)and the subsistence 
(about $1.75 per week) will be borne 
by the student, same to be deposited 
in advance. Students having the ar 
tides of clothing above enumeratec1 
will not be required to buy others.
(d) That the government will furn 
ish without cost, same to be turned ir 
upon completion of camp, the follow 
ing: cots, blankets, mosquito bars oi 
nets, tentage, cooking outfits; also ; 
complete infantry equipment for each 
man, both Q. M. and ordinance prop 
erty; and the necessary transportation 
and such other articles as may be 
found necessary.
(e) That the government will pro 
vide the necessary personnel for in 
struction, organization and sanitation
These camps will be held during 
the coming summer, one at the Get 
tysburg National Park, Pennsylvania 
from July 7 to August 15, inclusive 
and the ether at the Presidio of Mon 
terey, California, from July 1st to Au 
gust 8th, inclusive.
The instruction and military exer 
cises will be confined, as far as prac 
ticable, to the mornings, and will no 
exceed a maximum of about foui 
hours work per day. This will be 
real military work, not play, and wil 
include a practical application of the 
proper precautions of heaitn, care o 
the person, camping and marching 
and instruction in military policy 
military instruction both theoretica 
and practical in the actual handling o 
troops in the field under simulated 
battle conditions, and instruction ir 
shooting by actual practice on a tar 
get range. The afternoons and even 
ings will, so far as practicable, with 
due regard to' proper supervision anc 
military necessities, be at the student 
disposal.
The necessary personnel for instruc 
tion, equipment and maintenance o 
the camp, arms, ammunition, etc., will 
be furnished by the government foi 
the duration of the camp.
This will include proper and ample 
tent accommodation, a sufficient num 
ber of bakers and cooks with appar 
atus for cooking, adequate hospital 
and medical attendance, wagon trans 
portation necessary, and in short 
everything that can be properly, ac 
cording to law, used for the propel 
equipment, health and comforts of 
those attending. Reduced rates or 
railroads, it is hoped, will be procurec' 
for those attending.
In return therefor it is expected the 
students will give their best and mos 
honest endeavor to further the sue 
cess of the instruction.
It is thought the plan will meet with 
the approval of the college authori 
ties, the students and the parents foi 
the following reasons: A healthy, out 
of door life for the summer vacatior 
and at a less expense than usually re 
quired when away from home; habit; 
of obedience, command, self-control 
order and personal hygiene; the inter 
est of the locality selected; the mutual 
benefit received by meeting and inti 
mateky mixing with students of othei 
well-known institutions, and the op 
portunity afforded for athletic work 
and the knowledge gained in the mili 
tary art through which, should theii 
country at any time stand in need o 
their services, they will be better fittec' 
to discharge their duty. A certificate 
of attendance will be given to eacl

Tickets for the Commencement 
luncheon at the Hotel Schenley at

be made for those securing tickets in 
advance. In case of emergency tick

both of these occasions.
The procession will start promptly 
at 10:15. On reaching the Foyer of 
the Institute the line will wait in the 
Foyer until the M. M. C. S. Seniors 
proceed to their seats.
In case of rain the march from the 
Schools to the Institute will be omit
ted, the Seniors to assemble in the 
left of the Foyer. The Marshals will 
observe the same line of formation.
The Graduating Classes and the 
undergraduates of the Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie School are to assemble 
promptly at 10:00 in the Orchestra 
Rehearsal Room of the Institute on 
Commencement morning, Tuesday, 
June 17th. This room is most easily 
reached by the down steps in the right 
hand corner of the carriage entrance. 
The Marshals will form the classes in
to line for the march up to the Music 
Hall. The order of march will be Day 
Graduates, Night Graduates, Juniors, 
Sophomores, Plebes, First Year Night.
In order that all classes, day and 
night graduates and undergraduates, 
may be fully represented on this im
portant occasion, every student is ex
pected to arrange to be present, if 
possible.

seats, the underclasses take any seats 
left on the Entire Orchestra Floor, 
with the Second Balcony for an over
flow.

IMPROVEMENTS 
ON THE CAMPUS.
the removal of the beanery to one of 
the buildings to be erected, thus al
lowing the present plot on the land
scape to be torn down. A boardwalk 
will then be constructed from the 
steps of Machinery Hall to the en
trance to the Design Building, as the 
money has already been appropriated 
the city is expected to lay sidewalksfrom Woodlawn avenue to the front 
of the Industries Building at some 
time during the summer. It is also 
hoped that a retaining wall can be 
obtained for the street above the new 
athletic field.
A new entrance is also planned for 
the Science Building, leading directly 
from the level of the campus. It will 
probably cut in through what is now 
the electrical department, permitting 
the abandonment of the present tem
porary entrance.
The new athletic field and the ten
nis courts will also be finished by fall 
as will the front facade of the Design 
Building. Work on the new Head 
House will also probably have been 
commenced by the opening of school.
It is the hope of the school authori
ties that by the opening of school next 
fall, the campus will have been laid 
out as far as possible and transformed 
from a collection of unsightly dump 
heaps into a thing of beauty. The 
grounds will be terraced and graded 
and grass and shrubbery planted.

decided, should be The Carnegie 
Service Committee. Last fall, after 
the address from representatives of 
the Intercollegiate Social Service 
Committee of Pittsburgh, a commit
tee was appointed to engage in pro
moting social service work. How
ever, this committee met with little 
success, as the students failed to show 
much enthusiasm, and only a few vol
unteered their services. The new 
committee intends to take up the work 
started by the old committee, and also 
to continue the Y. M. C. A. work now 
being carried on in practically all of 
the fraternities. For these two pur
poses, it will divide into two sub
committees, each to be headed by a 
sub-chairman, and to carry on its own 
branch of the work. The General 
Committee will have two stated meet
ings, one as early as possible in the 
fall in order to get the work started 
before the students become too en
grossed in other activities; the other 
in the spring to appoint new men to 
carry on the work during the succeed
ing year.
The committee elected W. E. Culp 
as general chairman, and C. E. Gilson 
as general secretary. The sub-chair
men will be chosen later. Detailed 
plans for the work are now being de
veloped, and early in the fall the com
mittee will be in a position to start 
the same.
