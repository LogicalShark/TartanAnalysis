Some of our members attending the convention have returned enthusiastic 'about the quality of their wor as compared with' that' of members of other chapters." Evidently Miss Kenley is a staunch believer In the idea that the work bf the students reflects back upon tbe instructors.
Miss Kenley received her higher learning at Earlham college, the

chosen from, tlu.i departi The choir specializes in . English songs. Miss kenleys astuteness in directing tbe choir enlarges the reason for having her name listed in the Whos Who among the women of the nation.

tbe members of its Athletic Association that I will enjoy my connection 
with Its coaching', staff.:. This is particularly true because of my per

Harpster, with whom I will co-operate in giving the Tartans the best 
we possibly can for 35." . ,
Jos says further that he has felt friendly towards the Tartans ever 
since he played against them in J2? and 24, when he was playing with 
the IrishI quote him again: "Every Noire Dame man always had 
high respect for a Carnegie leam. -Rockne and Steffen created a friend

ficially ended. ,Macalka Elected Captain Afier the game with the Dukes, Joe. Macnlka was elected captntu of the basketball team for next year. 'Joe has built up quite n record in his threeyears at Carnegie, and undoubtedly deserves to be houored by being elected to the captaincy. In his freshman year, he war one of the stars on the Plobe oul lit, and piled up quite a few point at his position as forward. In hU next year, his first on tbe Vtfrslt. ie started out well at-the beijlnding of the season, but was soon token out by the well-known wrecker of Turluu basketball teams, the Ineligibility jinx. .This year, however. without anything to keep hit, off the. team, he played groat ball, eivrnhig .for himself this special honor  which has been awarded...... Macalka . succeeds ' Captain| Ted. Rlgg, who with Johnny Ewnlt have played their last for Curnegie. These two boys are the only seniors os the present squad.
The 1934-35 season has been one of which Carnegie fans may well he proud, although it may not be described as being highly victorious. But the team was good with greater consistency than it r;a the previous year, and in spite of the fact that the number of victories does not equal the number o? -defeats, the outfit was repeatedly recognized as one of the strongest in this district by its opponents. Considering that this was a season of an' unusually large number of outstanding floor squads, the record which the Tartans made against their opposition is one about which

TOMORROW FOR THE YOUNG MEN OF 
FRANCE 
By Edward Price Bell 
Paris:
Young academic France solid against war, 
fervidly national yet sanely International, 
overwhelmingly for the preservation in France 
of a clvilzation which Is French and which Is 
free.
That would seem to be about the core of the
Diversities of sentiment and thought in 
France are almost numberless. Feeling and 
conviction and expression are 6trong from 
oae end to (he other of 'the political, social, 
and economic diameter. This Is true not only 
of the academic youth; it is true of all ele* 
ments of the French population, In the cities 
and in.tho country. France is on the verge of 
great politico-economic changes. Nobody 
knows from day to day what will happen, and everyone talks of the possibility of la guerre civile (civil war).
But Qt> one wants either civil war or international war, least of ell. the youth, and especFrench. sLudents, stout-limbed, bright-eyed, ardent, brilliant, in a Paris class-roomsay a class-room of l'Ecole Normale Suprieure or lEcole Polytechniqueand ask:
"Does any one of you believe in war?, 
No! with a roar that shatters all chance of question.
'Yes; differences many and grave.
A towering, lanky, dark-young man rises in the center of the group, and speaks In rapidAre French:
"Noue avons beaucoup d'ldees diffrentes que nous soutenons avec passion, mais nous voulons y penser et les etudier; noUB avons besoin non nous 6e battre, mais nous s'entendre.
want to fight about them; we want to think about them, to understand one another.")
You feel important governmental developments are Imminent?" 
The towering young man replies:
"Qul; la treve actuelle nest pas durable. (The present truce of parlies cannot lAst.) 
Such are the sentiments and the will of young academic France, so eager, so impetuous even, so rich in bodily and mental vigor,
channels within Jules Romains isdeclares: (Nous pouvons nouB reveille main avec la guerre civile.") ("We may e tomorrow in civilwar.") However, determined efforts are on foot for understanding and approximation, lest France awake morning to find herself,- not only in civil but under the threat, as. the former Pre Doumergue affirmed, of invasion.
One of the gifted and convinced partielperieure, a Normalien. He is tall, spare, wiry, add energetic, with black halr;and piercing, friendly brown eyes, a young man of Dutch extraction, far back, a thorough Frenchman in appearance and spiritual quality. He is a prominent member of Jeune Republlque. an organization which stands about midway between the extremists of French politics, and an organization which is active In the pacifaclory movement. M. Hoog belongs to le Groupe dn '9 Juillet (The Group of the Ninth of July), composed of nineteen men, representing a great diversity of opinion, who have agreed upon a Minimum Plan for the form of conditions In the realm of French political economy.
You agree, was suggested to him In a private talk, "with those wlio hold that war is no solution for anything, is utterly disastrous? 
"Entirely."
War has no glamor for French students?"
There is nothing in the notion, frequently met, that the iniquities and calamities of war mean little or less to the rising generation?'1
"We are acutely conscious of them all. They are burned into us, not only by what we have read and witnessed iu pictures, hut by what we personally have seen of their results, and by our own study and'reasoning.
'.'So you are lighting la guerre civile? 
With all our strength. - 
Ana war o( every kind?"
Every kind.
"Hopefully?
Not,  despairingly, certainly, though: the
; Do you fear Germany?
^Germany hangs above us like an avalanche, ilh. wajyj -are-made -hard., and sniooth^ritiU .ways and -highwaysfor the possible descent :of tbit avalanche upon us. as It has descended upon us several times in the past, leaving permanent  scars upon our national memory. Remember Germany. Is a' very heavy avalanche, and very close to us. Remember you can lunch in Paris, and, traveling at a moderate speed in an automobile, dine in Germany. Remember-the people of Germany outnumber ours almost two to one. Remember Germanys war-llke potentialities exceed those of France by a tremendous margin. Naturally, we fear Germany.  Naturally, preoccupation with the German danger'dominates our minds and'determlnes our political policies. Anything like parity of 'armaments between Germany and France means. French insecurity, an Intolerable peril to France, unless other great Powers stand by our side. Hence .our long-UTged plea for a definite, and irrefrangible organization of
And. yet, in spite of all that has happened. In spite of the savage invasions, and In spite of the nearness to us of this mighty mass of German strength, young academic France desires to see lear and hatred of Germany disappear from this country.' These feelings barm us. They distract us from, domestic problems. They' are a brake upon our;, progress. We want mutual sympathy and trust between Germans and oureelves, .as we want these' sentiments between other nations .and ourselves; we af.TiothTn^hopVhd In filth,' Internationalists; ' We want our own national' ity, the Independence and integrity of our own civilisation, and .we want .other peoples to have theirs.. Hence we are.dlBincllned to rush headlong against'Hitler, to condemn-him. out of hand. There has beeu a revolution in Germany, and ravotations-often aro marked by tragic and terrible things.'. : Hitler has been at the helm only two. years.- We prefer] tb be forbearing while tie world awaits the real historical measure of the man.

We have here a building known i the Michigan League which .is the center of women's government and activities and which, has a membership of about *3,000 wotrien.
actively interested in the members: of th various cmmltles which . conduct the business and. social life of the woen on campus.
New System* Instituted Last May inaugurated a new governmental system at the League. Formerly the president.

Developments in Motion Picture Art
By R osemnry Pierce;
. Found, alter several years' of 
speculation .about' the possibility

'''Recently the Arts Department of the University of'Pittsburgh offered, two. French-movies, Salvador Dalis Xe Chietf Andalou, and a drains of -provincial life; Foil. de Carolte." So. utterly'different were they' from' the conventional: American Dim, that their novelty alone was welcome, aside from their significance and merit.Dal! Portrays'Mr. Dalis film showed tbei want graphic effects,- but at.- the same time, Its unusual-theme suggests a broader conception of photography as a means'of-expression. It was an attempt to objectify n nightmare, with all the gruesome and unrelated images' that, torment the' mind .in such a state.. Its cfraida onsist^.-.-hot in. anVerter* nai conflict ' of ambitions ormo-- tlves, but in the Intangible-strugsnd curiosity as to what It about, but this feeling' soon changes to one of cold horror when, without any  warning or preparation, a man picics up 'his razor, deftly silts open the. eye of a woman sitting in the.rpom, and then calmlj watches .fit quiver.

Then, too, they didnt, insult aspirations by offering such cheap substitute satisfactions as the common "fags lo riches :tales in circulation..

^ Public Occupational Clinic
Unemployed Adults Classified by Vocational Tests, 
Interviews, History Records; Advice Given 
On Personal Problems; Publish Results
groups the following 'estimates 
were . made as a .result ot the 
study: (!)_ About 10 per cent' ot 
unemployed persona will probably 
return to their former jobs; (2) 
about 10 per cent wili^robably se
cure better'jobs; (3) about 80 per ctut will probably secure similar jobs with  a new employer;, (4) from to 30 per cent, will be' obliged to readjust to a new type of.job; (B) from 20-to 2C per cent will probably never again hold a steady remunerative job.
The report proposes tho establishment of an-occupntlonnl adjustment clinic to which persons' now unemployed might apply for adice, and suggestions on the probAllegheny county to which unemployed, adults might apply for ad-ice - and assistance, in securing lew jobs is cited by Prof. Glen 'U. Cleeton, head of the Department of' Industrial Education at Carnegie, in a book . ontltled. Occu* pationai. Adjustment. which
made by Protossor Cleeton In operation with the Pennsylvnnln State Employment service, ^preparing the study, work experience records of 1&6;6CS persons registered at the State-Federal Employment bureau, 10S Smlthfield street, Pittsburgh were analyzed.
Selected Groups Classified Selected groups of unemployod adults were theu carefully classified *by means of vocational tests, Interviews, and personal history records. Advice on personal problems was given to 2,000 persons enrolled In'emergency schools'for unemployed adults. Through this service, the persons studied were, aided in selecting courses, determining vocational fltuees, and correcting certain, personality traits which appeared to be'Interfering, with vocatlonal success.
The following'onclu'sionis were' reached as a' result of the general study of all registrants In the State Employment office and nn J_1*  case study of 2,000 sodlvlduale: Granting even optimistic prospects for economic recovery, re-employment iB .likely to occur slowly. Some, persons now ' unemployed will never again enjoy Bteady remuner*;
although .they' may find similar jobs with new employer's.'
Readjustments Needed 
"Re-employment will not be, therefore,'a simple problem of job finding and placement. As a result of the careful Investigation of Individual cases that -will' be made by employers before hiring many persons among those unemployed at present, they will find it necessary lo make certain readjustments' before steady employment can be fiecured. 
'With  any marked movement toward re-employment, occupational adjustment, going far beyond job finding' and placement, will be) necessary for about sixty, per of the' unemployed persona living In Allegheny county. This means that' even though' active .re-employment were to be-' come.an -Immediate.fact,- approximately -100,000 unemployed ' per' in Allegheny ; county would become occupational /or social adjustment cases'.  -  
The report indicates .that .about 17i^00empl.DyaWe&erson&>'ftfe,-atl present without work In Allegheny, county...,  This represents about -third . of the normal .employment reported in 1930; . Of. those unemployed, abo\it 38,000.; are at present seeking their first full-time job.  The longer unemployment is delayed, the larger this .group of
lem. ot preparing for and Hlnga Job. It is suggested that Buch clinic might work in close co operatloo. with the State Employment service and other placement guidance .and training agencies .in Pittsburgh.
Various social service agencies which could co-operato in tho readjustment of unemployed adults are indicated Jn tbe report. Theso organizations mentioned include the Stn(e Employment service, Junior Employment servlco, public achoots, universities and colleges, -Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. and Y. M. H. At, Federation of Social agencies, Pittsburgh Council on Adult Education, Central Labor unlou, Retail
burgh have Indicated their willingness to cooperate with the Pittsburgh Personnel association in formulating plans for a publicly supported occupational adjustment clinic;'
From the intensive study of 2,000 unemployed persons it waB. found that about one-third were occupationally maladjustedthat is, bad previously worked at or were Interested in a type of work for which they showod so puriiculor fitness. Among this group nbout .80 per cent woro found to bo suffering serious emotional ' digturbances. In view , ofthe extremely trying economic condition eurroundlng unemployed' persons, it is surprising; that tho number of omotlonally - disturbed was not larger.
'Women's Vocations Crowded.
In the study of vocational inter, ests of this group, it was found that an^ extremelylarge number of women ^ere interested in. already over-crowded vocations. This was shown by. a. concentration of Interests in. siich occupations as secretary typist, stenographer, and dev
shown by a high percentage.the women " included in ,the' . study: laundress, factory worker, landlady, baker, waitress, bookbinder, atid' elevator operator. '
'. !Favored occupations reported t)y the> men Included:  undertaker, auctioneer, insurance and real. estate ' salesman;; clergyman, florist, music teacher, social worker,., aud politician.' m. wide range of Interests In - occupations was shown by both, the m'en and the women.

Council-is a student organization empowered by its 'constitutional  rights to govern-the various activitiessponsored by the night dents.Changes in conditions the campus often require.- new /laws, or a. revision of the old.. Ii .no. event should p. new law he . passed or an old one rescinded '.which would bedetrimental to the /welfare of the students. The mi bers of-council are reprsentai!'

Night Student Council
Question ot Activities 
Fees A Campus Problem
Prom the most casual' observa
tion it is apparent that'extra curri
cular activities are a necessary 
adjunct to any college and It must 
alsobe apparent that some sort of 
revenue should be counted upon so 
that the extra curricular activities 
may be assured of needed financial support for their exi^tence.-W The man source of. revenue therefor must.be from student '^activities tees since these fees can be collected from the Individual student and the amount' Is limited only to the number of students registered.
. In the early days of the Institute when .Carnegie was known as tho Carnegie. Technical ScboolB and later when the name was changed to the Carnegie Institute of. Technology, with the exception of the war year, a-compulsory fee of three dollars was collected from.ea flight student." pwt of this allocated to tfte -Athletic!. Assdciation and the balunce went to the non-athletlc fund.
The.omount going to the non-atli letlc fund was administered by Student Activities.-Board and the various groups which held functions applied, to this board for the -budget necessary to conduct its tlvlties. ' The importance and si:
xhls general fund. As was expected the demands made upon the fund were greater than the amounts available for distribution and some of tbe' petitioning groupn were afforded little or no financial support; this was especially true when [be group or function did not hv long or continued -standing. In the. latter group fell those functions of the night section.
While it is true that the night students were permitted to participate in the general -campus activities and that, they did contribute loyally in every way possible to the success of these student organizations, there were, times when some Individual function -was presented by the night. group and often, because of no available funds, the whole, financial burdena Tested , upon the'sponsors of tho'
dents, thisrepreeem always .productive * support, and often tl pri. causeila feeling f dlaeatlsfac* an.
