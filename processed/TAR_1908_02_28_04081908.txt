TECH BADLY BEATEN
VOL. II, No. 28TEN CENTS.PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 1908
W. V. U. WINS BY LARGE SCORE.
On Saturday afternoon, April 4, our base-ball 
team went to Morgantown and opened the season 
with the team representing the West Virginia Uni
versity. The weather was cleer and bright and just 
cool enough to put the players and spectators on 
edge.
A prominent citizen of Morgantown made a 
short address befitting the occasion and at 3.30 teams 
lined up for action with Tech at bat and W. V. U 
in the field. The first man up hit out a beauty to 
left which looked good for two bags; but by sensa
tional running catch Lefty Core, the Wheeling 
Central League star, gathered it in. Tech got men 
on base in the first, but poor base running and fast 
fielding prevented a score. . In W. V. U.s half, con
secutive hitting and daring base running netted four 
tallies. In the second Tech was retired in order, 
but W. V. U. failed to be fooled by Dischners slants 
and by the time the nightmare was over no less than
eleven men chased across the plate. The work of 
the Tech team, as a whole, in this inning was most 
ragged, and even with the introduction of a new 
battery it took several innings for them to settle 
down. On the other hand W. V. U. seemed to gain 
in speed as the contest proceeded and kept up their 
good work until the close of the game.
While it looks like a case of hard loser, and 
realizing that the team on the short end of a 23-0 
score ought to have but little to say, mention ought 
be made of the unsatisfactory work of Umpire Suth
erland, who performed in the absence of a worse 
man for the position. If some of the Tech men had 
displayed as much ginger in the game as they did 
afterward there would have been a smaller score.
The dance given in honor of the Tech team and 
all the other courtesies extended by Manager Foulk 
and the students of the university were greatly ap
preciated by the humiliated Tech men.

THE TARTAN
THE THISTLE MATTER IS SETTLED.CRUCIBLE-CIVIL DANCE.
On Sunday of last week a rumor was started 
from some apparently good sources to the effect that 
the Director would sanction the publication of a 
student annual from the School of Applied Science 
only provided that no advertising is solicited. Ac
cordingly a meeting was held together by the Junior 
and Senior classes to formulate plans for such a 
book, and it was decided to publish one. Some of 
the students believed the Director in favor of the 
project, but when he entered the meeting such ideas 
were quickly dispelled. The two classes first voted 
to support the Thistle and do all in their power 
to help the board which has the matter in charge. 
Then the project of the publication of an Applied 
Science book came up and was adopted, as it was 
the general impression that the former vote did not 
prohibit the Applied Science book. After a heated 
discussion the officers of the classes were asked to 
confer with the Director and report his exact views 
on the matter. They retired, and after about an 
hour of discussion reported to the class that the stu
dents were in the wrong. As matters now stand no 
other student publication will appear this year and 
the members of the Senior and Junior Classes have 
practically pledged themselves to prevent the pub
lication of such a book and to support the Thistle 
of Carnegie Tech.
SEMI-FINALS ARE HELD.
Yesterday afternoon the trials fcr the Relay 
team were again held. The track is not yet in the 
best of condition, but the time was fair considering. 
It is encouraging to both Coach and Captain to see 
such a lot of uniformly good men keep up the work 
and not let spring fever interfere with practice.
In the first heat Halferty finished first, Hatcher 
second and Frampton third. The second heat was 
practically a tie with Bates and Charles leading and 
Hosey a close third. Charles had to sprint to make 
the position, as Hosey led nearly the whole length 
of the course. In the third heat, which was won by 
Dowling, Ross fell but was given second place, as the 
race was practically over. Wylie was third.
Last evening at the McDougall Dancing Academy, 
the first large informal dance of the season was 
held by the combined Crucible and Civil Societies. 
The committee in charge consisted of Messrs. Ja
cobs, Pfeil, and Kann of the Crucible Society, and 
Messrs. Seisel, Vincent, and Jamison of the Civil 
Society. The faculty was well represented by Dr. 
James, Dr. Hokanson, and Mr. Leete. It is easy to 
guess which of the above parties excelled in the barn 
dance, so no mention of names need be made. Danc
ing started about 9.15 with about forty couples and 
two stags present. Light refreshments were served 
during the dance. The party broke up at about one 
oclock after one of the most enjoyable evenings. 
The members of the two societies are to be congrat
ulated on their efforts to bring about a closer union 
between Senior and Junior classes, and also on the 
success of the affair.
---------o---------
The Senior Mechanicals Prime Mover section 
are to make a series of tests on turbine nozzles dur
ing the last term, which will form the basis for a 
kind of thesis. The Machine Design section has fin
ished a number of interesting tests of high speed 
steels which prove the weaknesses of machine tools 
to withstand the forces necessary in the operation 
of these steels.

Notice.
The banquet committee have nearly completed 
arrangements for the Big Affair that is to take place 
in the near future. All men who have not as yet 
declared their intention of attending should make 
application for a place at once, for we know they 
will regret the fact that they did not interest them
selves a little later on. It is the aim of the com
mittee to outdo all previous affairs and make this 
event go down as one of the bright pages in Tech 
history. It has been intimated that our brother 
Day Industrial students would like to join in the 
affair, and it is with a great deal of pleasure we learn 
this. We cordially invite them and hope to see a 
large representation present.

PLEBES
Well, here we are once more, whats left of us, 
at the end of another term. Queer, dont you think, 
the older we get the faster time flies? One single 
afternoon, when I was in the first reader, I distinctly 
remember, was a complete age in itself. Playing 
Indian in the woods. It began with us all imper
sonating savages of the truly prehistoric -variety. 
Before long two tribes evolved and warfare began. 
The history of those two tribes was followed through 
all the different kinds of savagery of which any of 
us had ever heard, and ended up in complete civil
ization. To our minds there was nothing in the way 
of having it take place in a single afternoon. What 
was lacking in time, our imaginations supplied. A 
week then was equal to a month now, and the sum
mer vacation a sufficient period in which to accom
plish almost anything in the way of shanties and 
rafts. And so the Grammar School period passed.
The change began to take place with leaps and 
bounds when a High School Freshmanperhaps, now 
that you come to think of it, you will remember it 
also. By the time of graduation, it had reached the 
present speed, and even now it seems to have con
siderable acceleration.
Aftr-life is usually running on a clear stretch, 
but college life is running over switches, some of 
which lead to the main line, some to the side track, 
others to the scrap heap. No one but the man him
self turns the switches; no one else can. Others 
may offer suggestions and give advice, but that is 
all.
This is a time to which the ambitious look for
ward, and to which all those who have passed 
through look back. It is unique for all of us, and will 
never come again. Already it has begun to slip 
away, this brief period of being an undergraduate. 
It is not long when compared to a mans whole life. 
More lasting impressions are received, old ideals 
shattered and better ones acquired, and true friend
ships formed, than, perhaps in any other equal 
length of time. So here we are, and fellows, lets 
make the best of it.

INTEGRATION.
What means this foolish dreaming, 
Monstrosity of deeming 
Disintegration wise in our school?
Why separate the Tartan,
For reason all so wanton?
For failure always follows such a rule.
What nation is the stronger,
What life was made the longer,
By obstinacy to natures major law?
The law of men united 
The law that Lincoln cited,
The law for which was fought the Civil War.
Lets wake ourselves to reason 
And try to stop this treason,
And lift on high our Alma Mater fair.
With one accord lets praise it,
One school, although composite,
And let us have a spirit that is rare.
Lets make an integration 
Of this all-schools relation,
And get results of which well all be proud. 
For then from every station,
And also every nation,
The praise for C. T. S. will oft be loud.

On Tuesday evening the Dramatic Club gave a 
comedy, Mr. Bob. The cast, consisting of the Misses 
Herron, Schwartz, Connell, Johns, Beymer, Alcorn 
and Harmon, did well in their respective parts.
A young and bashful professor was frequently 
embarrassed by jokes his girl pupils would play on 
him. These jokes were so frequent that he decided 
to punish the next perpetrators, and the result of 
this decision was that two girls were detained an 
hour after school and made to work some difficult 
problems as punishment. It was the custom to an
swer the roll-call with quotations, so the following 
morning, when Miss A.s name was called, she rose, 
and looking straight in the professors eye, repeated: 
With all thy faults I love thee still, while Miss
B.s quotation was: The hours I spend with thee, 
dear heart, are as a string of pearls to me.

J. H. Taxis, Editor.
In the controversy between the classes of 1910,
1911 and 1912, class 1910 withdraws.
In a friendly, inter-class bantering match, 1910 
will be found able to take care of itself, but when 
its opponents descend into the sewer for ammunition, 
discretion demands that we retreat, lest we, too, be 
smeared with the slime into which our esteemed 
opponents have delved. He who handles pitch will 
be defiled. Therefore, no further reference shall 
be made to the classes of 1911 or 1912.
The new schedule went into force last week,

This is probably due to the short time it has 
been effective, or, as we have kicked so long, and 
in vain, for a change, that no one is interested in 
schedules.
We are accustomed to coming often and staying

William Metcalf, Jr., was born in Pittsburgh in 
what is now the 17th ward, April 16, 1870. Son of 
William Metcalf, Steel Manufacturer, graduated from 
the Shattuck Military School, Faribault, Minn., and 
attended the University of Michigan one year, and 
part of a year at Cornell University in the civil en
gineering course. He went into business in Pitts
burgh, first with the Crescent Steel Company and 
later as a partner and director of the Frank-Kneeland 
Machine Company. In the spring of 1898, he gave 
up active participation in business and took up the 
study of law at Cornell University, graduating from 
the College of Law with the class of 1901. He has 
been practicing law in Pittsburgh since October 4th, 
1902, and has always taken an active interest in 
politics, believing that if reform in public affairs 
is needed, such reform can best be obtained by first 
instituting reform within the prominent political 
parties, thus insuring better candidates for office 
and consequently more efficient service by office 
holders. He has represented the twenty-second ward 
in Select Councils since April, 1906. Trustee of the 
Institute and Library. Chairman of Committee on 
Buildings and Grounds, also a member of the Build
ing Committee of the Tech Schools. Gn the Board of 
Directors of the University Club for several years 
and was Vice President ot the same for two years.
He is now a candidate for the Republican nomina
tion of Representative from the Twenty-third Con
gressional District.
Mr. Metcalf is a member of the Chi Psi fratern
ity and has always taken a prominent part in all 
Alumni activities. Although the men at Tech have 
had no opportunity to meet him, he is an interested 
and strong friend of the school.
---------o---------
DUTY ON FERRO-VANADIUM.
That importers of ferro-vanadium should pay 
a duty of $2,000 a ton instead of $4, as at present, is 
the contention of the Federal government in an ac
tion against the Midvale Steel Company. The case 
was considered by the United States board of gen
eral appraisers, but it will go to the courts for final 
adjudication.
The Midvale and other steel companies import 
considerable quantities of Ferro tungsten, ferro 
chrome, ferro vanadium and ferro manganese, all of 
which contain a combination of the iron with another 
metal and are desirable in producing special kinds 
of steel. This ore has been imported heretofore 
under a duty of $1 a ton, under section 7 of the 
similitude clause of the tariff act of 1898. The treas
ury department contends that these should be classed 
as metallic mineral substances in a crude state and 
metals unwrought, not specifically provided for in 
the tariff law, dutiable at 20 per cent, ad valorem.
Ferro vanadium in a pure form is valued at 
$10,000 a ton, and the duty at 20 per cent, would be 
$2,000 instead of $4 a ton.
There have been two conflicting decisions by the 
United States Courts. The collector at the New 
York port was reversed in one ot these decisions on 
exactly the claim made in this case, but at Philadel
phia the collector was upheld, according to General 
Appraiser Fisher, who took the testimony in this 
case and will write the decision.
Among the witnesses for the government were 
Professor Joseph W. Richards of Lehigh University, 
and Professor Ihlseng of the University of Pennsyl
vania.

we will manage to make a success of it without your 
generous (?) help! Just think of that!

12THE TARTAN
THE DETROIT RIVER TUNNEL.
Where the Detroit River defines the boundary 
line between this country and Canada five important 
railroads cross: Michigan Central, Wabash, Grand 
Trunk system, Pere Marquette, and Canadian Pa
cific. Powerful transfer steamers up to the present, 
capable of taking on their broad decks entire lim
ited trains, have served as the conduit for passen
gers and traffic from Detroit to Windsor. Fifteen 
minutes is the usual time in crossing the river, but 
the switching and coupling on the other side occupy 
thirty or forty minutes,a serious delay in fast ser
vice between the East and West; but in winter, 
when the ice floes obstruct the river, the delay is 
longer. Freight traffic has grown to enormous pro
portions in recent years, and this renders the ferry 
more than ever inadequate.
Hence the project of a tunnel between Detroit 
and Windsor, below the bed of the river, to reduce 
the time of a trains crossing to seven or eight min
utes, and avoid delays and expense incident to the 
maintenance of expensive ferries, which are slow 
and cumbersome. This tunnel will come as the 
culmination of Mr. Henry B. Ledyards successful 
administration of the Michigan Central system. He 
is the originator of this stupendous undertaking, 
which is now in charge of an advisory board of en
gineers, consisting of Mr. William J. Wilgus, chair
man, vice president of the N. Y. C. & H. R. R.; H. A. 
Carson, chief engineer of the Boston Transit Com
mission, and Mr. W. S. Kinnear, chief engineer of the 
Detroit River Tunnel Company, in direct charge of 
construction, says Mr. James C. Mills in Cassiers 
Magazine for January.
Months and months have been spent in plan
ning this tunnel, until the final method of construc
tion was adopted in the summer of 1906. This pro
vides for a double-barreled tunnel of steel and 
concrete, through which trains will be operated by 
electricity. The Butler Bros.-Hoff Company, of New 
York, is the contractor, and in the early summer of 
1909 the tunnel is to be opened. Its method of con
struction is novel and unlike all other plans for 
similar undertakings. The section of this tunnel 
under the stream will be 2,622 feet long, and the 
rivers depth varies from twenty to forty-eight feet. 
A wide and deep trench is being excavated, into 
which great steel tubes will be lowered into place 
and, when adjusted, covered with concrete. Briefly 
speaking, this is the tunnel. It is the idea of Mr. 
Wilgus. The trench will be excavated to the depth 
of forty-five feet below the bed of the river, and will 
be forty feet wide at the bottom. Piles are then 
driven down to the bottom of this trench to serve 
as a support for the huge tubes while they are being 
bolted in place.
Building these tubes is a colossal wok. Made 
from plates of steel three-eights of an inch thick, the 
sections are twenty-three feet in diameter and 260 
feet long. At intervals of eleven and one-half feet

on the outside there are transverse diaphragms 
strengthen the tunnel and divide into sections the 
space to be filled with concrete. When ready for 
lowering, the tubes, with ends plugged to render 
them watertight, are floated and brought exactly 
over their intended resting place. Then water is 
admitted, and they settle by gravitation on the sub
merged supports. This operation calls for the high
est engineering skill. To aid in this undertaking 
each tube is provided with a detachable upright at 
each end to indicate its position when sinking. As 
these extend about ten feet above the water, they 
serve to adjust the lateral position of the tubes.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN13
(I
When laterally adjusted, divers descend and ex
amine the tubes carefully, to see if the bearings of 
the diaphragms on the beams of the pilings are in 
place and, also, to bolt the huge sections together. 
On each tube sleeve at one end, which can be 
slipped over the end of the tube preeviously sunk. 
This has a flange that is bolted to a corresponding 
flange on the other tube, a rubber gasket being 
placed between them. A similar gasket is fitted in 
the inner end of the sleeve bearing up against the 
edge of the other tube. With the sleeves and gas
kets in place, bolting follows, the gaskets being 
squeezed together between the ends of the tubes, 
forming a tight joint. A space of three by eighteen 
inches is thus formed around the tubes at the end 
of the joint, and this is filled with a grout of cement.
Concrete is the nejct factor. Gravel is first de
posited over the bottom of the trench to a depth of 
two feet, to make a proper bed for the concrete, 
which, upon hardening, encompass the foundation, 
piling, the tubes, diaphragms, and sleeves in a solid 
mass of stone. A trough of oak planking is built 
without the tubes, and into this trough the concrete 
is chuted and spread over the bottom of the trench, 
and is carried up over the tops of the tubes to a 
thickness of about five feet. Within these tubes 
will be built twenty-inch thick rings of concrete, and 
these are the tunnels proper. When completed, 
there will be a clear head ctf eighteen feet from the 
top of rails to center of of arch, and sixteen and onehalf feet wide across the center line. Ten 2G0-feet 
sections will be required to connect the American 
and Canadian dock lines. Including the approaches, 
the total length is 7,960 feet from portal to portal, 
and the open cuts are 4,840 feet additional, or, in all, 
nearly two and one-half miles. Concrete is the main 
factor in the construction of this tunnel, and it is 
estimated that 300,000 barrels o Portland cement, 
250,000 tons of screened gravel, and nearly 1,000,000 
barrels of sand will be required. The tunnel will 
be of the light concrete finish, brilliantly lighted, 
clean and well ventilated. Its cost will be at least 
$8,000,000, which will be defrayed by the Michigan 
Central Railway.
In constructing the approach tunnels, two shafts 
were sunk on each side of the river, one on each 
shore, and others about half way between the first 
shafts and the portals. In ' this way a number of 
excavating gangs may be worked at the same time 
by digging in both directions. The operations are 
are going on steadily, and beside the excavating, 
concrete gangs are mixing and building up the walls 
of the bores with concrete. These walls are four 
feet thick, arched overhead, and covered with a 
water-proofing of layers of tar, pitch and felt, which, 
in turn, is protected from injury by four inches of 
cement and brick. The shafts near the river banks 
are to be permanent, and are lined with strong dou
ble walls of concrete. They will serve to ventilate 
the tunnel and as outlets for the drainage pipes, as 
well as an exit in case of accident in the tunnel.

The 1911 class meeting called for Wednesday 
evening, April 8th, is the last regular meeting of the 
school year of 1907-08. As was stated in last weeks 
issue of the Tartan, there will be a little smoker 
while the business is being transacted in the hope 
that the fellows will take a little more interest in 
class affairs. The social committee think that by 
making the meetings a little more attractive better 
attendances will be had, and it is to them that the 
credit for the smoker idea is due. Come out and 
join with the boys in one last gathering of this year.

CAUTION OVERDONE.
Some of the members of the Civil Society and 
Crucible Club have been made the victims of a pecu
liar set of circumstances, owing to the place their 
dance was held. Let it be said at the outset that
no person can blame a young lady for exercising
discretion as to what invitations she accepts, but 
we think there is a point at which prudence becomes 
prudishness, and, if that point was not reached by 
the young ladies who refused invitations on account 
of the hah in which the dance was held, it was very
nearly so. In the first place the use of the hall
was very kindly donated by one of the Crucibles, 
and on its acceptance by the societies for their com
bined function, ceased to be a public place of enter
tainment and became for the evening the head
quarters of the organizations giving the dance. It 
would seem then that more reflection was cast on the 
boys of the school who were managing the affair, 
as well as all who attended than txpon the regular 
occupants of the hall, if the arguments used by 
the young ladies offending were to be considered 
as well taken and binding in all cases. How many 
of our halls and hotels would be available when we 
wished to entertain our friends at any affair larger 
than could be accommodated in the very limited 
room at the disposal of the schools? Inquiry has 
failed to substantiate the statement made by some 
of our friends that it would mean social ostracism 
to all attending, and those attending feel that the 
only ones who suffered were those who did not go.
The fact that a counter attraction in the shape 
of a play at the Margaret Morrison school kept many 
away is unfortunate as probably quite a few who 
either had never heard of the reasons given above, 
or wouTd have ignored them if they had, did not ac
cept as they judged, and correctly, too, that they 
owed allegiance to their own school and its enter
tainments first.
This is the first time that any grievance has 
.been found by the boys of Applied Science against 
the Margaret Morrison school and we are hoping 
that while our sisters will continue to act with 
circumspection they endeavor to make the School 
of Applied Science the victim of overzealousness.
