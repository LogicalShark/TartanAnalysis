Human speech sounds will be 
created by electrical means at 
Carnegie Tech when the Voder. 
(Voice Operation Demonstration) 
together with the complete Worlds 
Fair Exhibit of the Bell Telephone 
Company is presented at a Car
negie Music Hall assembly spon
sored, by Tau . Beta Pi, national 
engineering honorary, on March 
25.
Creation of Speech
This unique assembly is a lecture-demonstration by Dr. J. 
Owen Perrine, assistant vice pres
ident of the American Telephone 
and Telegraph Company. Dr. Perrines topic will be The Arti
ficial Creation of Speech, a sub
ject that has been under investi
gation for more than a century. 
Only at a comparatively recent 
 date has it been possible to de
sign electrical apparatus which 
successfully produces human 
speech.
Pittsburgh schools, including the 
three colleges and various high 
schools, are to be invited to the 
demonstration-lecture, which is 
scheduled for 11:30 A. M., March 
25. The general public will also be 
permitted to attend the assembly, 
the .first of its kind at Carnegie.
The Voder, an electrical appar
atus, the only machine to create 
human speech sounds, was design
ed by the Bell Telephone Labora
tories and is built entirely, except 
for its keys, of apparatus used in 
everyday telephone service.
Kinds of Speech
This instrument produces the 
two lands of sound used in human 
speech. One kind is made by forc
ing the breath through the mouth, 
past the tongue, teeth, and lips 
while shaping the mouth cavity. 
This is the way the unvoiced con
sonant sounds like s and h 
are made. The other kind of 
sound which enters into human
speech comes from the vocal 
cords. The most important of these 
sounds are the vowels.
Following the lecture Dr. Per
rine will be the guest of honor at 
a luncheon for the faculty and 
telephone company guests.

A movement has been started 
to obtain reduced street car rates 
for college students. Students on 
the various campuses feel that an 
action similar to the reduction of 
rates for high school students 
would be of advantage to the col
lege students. In addition, they 
believe that the Railways Com
pany would benefit as well.
Action on this question began at 
P. C. W.; where answers to ques
tionnaires, similar to those ap
pearing today in the TARTAN, in
dicated that alarge number of 
non-street car users would ride 
them more frequently if the rates 
were reduced. Statistics based on 
these results show thatthe Rail
ways Company would gain finan
cially if rates were reduced 20 
per cent.
Techs representative, William 
Heilman, has been consulting with 
representatives from Pitt, . Duquesne, P. C. W. and Mount Mercy 
for the past few weeks. The com
mittee is certain that the Railways 
Company would be convinced by 
sufficient evidence that it would 
gain rather than lose by the re
duction. Further information, and 
progress of the committee will be 
published weekly in the TARTAN.
Dont forget to vote on this is
sue today. By answering the 
questionnaire presented .on the 
bottom of this page you may help 
to reduce the street car rates. 
Ballot boxes will be open from 
11:30 to 1:30 today at the entrance 
to Machinery Hall, The Commons, 
and the usual balloting places in 
Engineering, Arts, and Margaret 
Morrison.
Students to Hear 
Met Present Faust
Phi Mu Alpha of Sonfonia, 
mens musical honorary fraternity, 
is sponsoring a special bus trip to 
Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday, 
April 19, to see the Metropolitan  
Operas presentation of Faust 
at the matinee and Rigoletto at 
the evening performance.
Three dollars is the price for 
the round trip fare. The first forty 
persons to pay will be assured of 
a seat, and in case there are 
enough to warrant it, a second bus 
will be chartered. Money for the 
trip should be given to Larry De 
Simone 42 or Jack Evans 42, both 
of the music department, on or be
fore March 20. The bus will leave 
Pittsburgh early Saturday morn
ing and return late the same night.
Tickets for the operas are priced 
at $3 for each performance. Money 
for tickets should be given to 
Ralph Diller 41 on or before 
March 20.
Further details may be obtained 
from any member of Phi Mu 
Alpha.
This trip is of especial interest 
to the Tech campus, since the 
Cleveland performances are the 
closest the Met comes to Pitts
burgh.
Faculty Produces 
Close Harmony
Techs faculty, under the direc
tion of Biff Liff, Drama, 41, is 
now rehearsing for their annual 
play. It will be given this year 
on the evenings of March 21 and 
22, in the Little Theatre.
This year the production will 
be Close Harmony, a farce de
picting the problems .a hen-pecked 
husband goes through before he 
asserts himself in his household. 
The humor in the play is afforded 
by the situations arising. when a 
hen-pecked wifea neighbor 
helps him. regain. his individual
ity, and almost elopes with him 
in the process. The play was writ
ten by Elmer Rice and Dorothy 
Parker and was givenin the Lit
tle Theatre this summer by the 
students taking summer work in 
the Drama Department.
The price for the tickets will be 
50c for members , of the faculty 
and 35c for students. Proceeds 
from the two performances .will 
be used for some beneficial means. 
Dr. Schultz, assistant professor of 
chemistry of Margaret Morrison, 
and Mr. McLean, of the Drama 
Department, are on the commit
tee in charge of the play.

Second Lieutenant Frank L. 
Avbcl of the United States Marine 
Corps will be on campus next 
Thursday and Friday to interview 
seniors for positions in the Corps. 
A school has been established at 
Quantico, Va., where a selected 
group of college graduates will 
undergp a three months training 
course with a view toward quali
fying for a commission as a Sec
ond Lieutenant of the United 
States Marine Corps Reserve.
Lieutenant A.vbel will conduct 
interviews from nine to five p. m. 
on the above mentioned days. At 
this time he will choose three 
principals and five alternates in an 
effort to fill a quota of twelve 
hundred Marine Reserve Officers 
from college seniors all over the 
country. Since this quota will be 
raised in the future, he will prob
ably conduct further interviews 
later in the year. Lieutenant 
Avbel is anxious to have as many 
applications as possible in order to 
assure the availability of a suffi
cient number of properly-quali
fied men.
Regular Commission
Those selected will spend, after 
graduation, three months as en
listed men (first-class privates) at 
Quantico. If they qualify, they 
will be appointed Second Lieuten. ants and will take a second three 
months course at various Marine 
Corps schools. This will be fol
lowed by active duty with troops 
for the duration of the national 
emergency. There will be an op
portunity for obtaining a com
mission in the regular corps after 
the emergency.
Pay will be $138 a month 
and $250 for uniform after the 
rank of second lieutenant has 
been achieved. Marine duty is 
line duty, not specialized, at land 
and naval bases and on battle
ships and cruisers. Not more than 
two years are spent at any one 
* station by a single individual. All 
male seniors are eligible.
Physical Requirements
The Marine Corps is the oldest 
of the three services. It was 
founded in 1775. It is also the 
smallest of the three.
Physical requirements are simi
lar to those of the Navy. Appli
cants must be at least 5 feet 6 
inches tall and not more than G 
feet four inches. They must be 
native American citizens. They 
must not be members of the R. O. 
T. C., Naval Reserve, or National 
Guard and must have or obtain 
recommendations as to character 
from reliable individuals.

Catholic priest in the Pittsburgh 
area, will speak at the annual 
Lenten Chapel sponsored by the 
Newman Club today at 11:30 in 
the Little Theatre, College of Fine 
Arts. His topic will be Religion

Father Rock, chaplain for all 
Catholic students at Pitt and 
Tech, is well known on this camp
us. For the last four years he has 
addressed Tech students at dif
ferent times on a variety of sub
jects. Reverend Rock started his 
career as a dentist, graduating 
from Pitt in 192G. His education 
had been interrupted by the War, 
at which time he left school, and 
joined the army. After the armis

By THOMAS WOOD BATTEN
Three weeks ago today, a cry 
which shook the foundations of 
Machinery Hall went up from the 
first floor of the Arts Building. 
Who is Thomas Wood Batten? 
the Drama Department demanded. 
This desire to learn my identity 
was prompted by no intellectual 
curiosity, but rather by a wish 
to deal with* the fellow. The De
partment had a three-fold griev
ance against me: I had been un
ethical in criticizing a play be
fore it opened; I had saddened 
them because I hadnt told them 
in advance that the article would 
appear; I had opened my review 
with an unkind observation 
about a previous production and 
indicated what I thought were 
weaknesses of the present one.
Their grievances were unjusti
fied. As a review of an opening 
night couldnt appear until a week 
later, I preferred to pre-review 
than not to review. The Drama 
Department was not consulted be
cause I feared unwarranted cen
sorshipthe very totalitarian 
measure I wished to avert. The 
Department has become so used 
to not having its productions at
tacked or praised in print that it 
has come to consider itself in
vulnerable to either. It construes 
praise to mean derogation. Thus 
was proved when the first article 
appeared. While the students and 
faculty prepared a rope suspended 
from the proscenium arch of the 
Fine Arts Theatre, the author of
Belly Bradley 
Provides Songs 
And Good Looks
The na^ons newest swing 
sensation in the person of Bob 
Chesterhis saxophone and his 
orchestra, comes to Hotel Sclienley this Friday for the Interfra
ternity Formal. This dance, of 
which Bob Webb, '42, is social 
chairman, is open to fraternity 
men only.
Featured with the band is love
ly Betty Bradley, newly acquired 
vocalist, whose popularity soars 
to new heights with each appear
ance. The warmth and sincerity of 
her style in rendering selections 
from sweet dreamy melodies to 
the livliest swing, captivates the 
heart of everyone.
Bob himself has had a rapid rise 
to fame. Among his first engage
ments after forming his orchestra 
in 1935 were at the William Penn 
Hotel in Pittsburgh, the Adolphus 
in Dallas and the New Yorker 
Hotel in New York. Everywhere 
he was acclaimed and picked to 
arrive in but a short while. 
Chester has broadcast over all the 
major networks, and his recent 
appearance on the Fitch Band
wagon brought loud applause. 
Swing, according to Bob, is the 
basis for all American music and 
the only true feeling and spirit of 
music here. His favorite orchestra 
is Tommy Dorsey, and he rates 
Connie Boswell, Jack Leonard and 
Bill Finnegan as No. 1, singers.
Prime focal point of the band 
is the brass, a precise, powerful 
quintet that, more than any other 
section, drives the entire outfit to 
 its greatest musical heights, Out
standing hero is first trumpeter 
Aloe Fila. Only nineteen years old, 
this lad possesses a tone, attack, 
range and consistency of which 
most men, who started playing 
about the time lie was born, can 
. be eternally envious,
All in all, its bound to be a 
swell show, so dont forget the 
placeHotel Schenley; the time10 til 2, and the price$3.50.
the play in question smiled and 
said that I, whoever I was, seemed 
to be a rather nice, urbane fel
low.
All of which leaves me little 
space for the business at hand 
John Gays The Beggars Opera. 
See it! Steal two tickets from Mrs. 
King if you have to, but see it! 
The costumes and settings, stu
dent-designed, are colorfully lun
atic. Acted, sung, and danced with 
a spirit of joy and abandon that 
rarely graces any stage, The 
Beggars Opex*a is the most de
lightful evening we have been of
fered this season.
The Oscar for all this goes to 
Mr. Lehman Engel, a New York 
importation, who has produced 
the entire show. He has directed 
the eighteenth century piece 
tastefully, imaginatively, and 
wackily. After the first five min
utes of the insanity which is The 
Beggars Opera, you are resigned 
to the realization that you are out 
of your mind and that what is go
ing on on stage is the only reality. 
It is easy to conjecture as to what 
produced this unique effect; the 
settings and costumes have such 
a remarkable uniformity of con
ception, and the acting of the ab
surd opera is so terrifyingly de
liberate that I defy you not to 
believe in their realism. Yet 
theorizing about the excellence of 
the opus which opens tonight is 
no goodthe secret lies in the in
calculable something a few indi
viduals possess. It lies in the ar
tistry of Lehman Engel.
Cut Ditch
Holes In Ground 
To Be Removed
By Gilbert Kivenson
Two years ago a plan was pro
posed by the Department of Arch
itecture. A modern, average-size 
home Was to be built on the cut. 
Plans were to be drawn, materials 
selected, furnishings chosen, and 
part of the actual building done 
by students under the direction of 
the faculty. It was agreed that 
the educational value of the en
terprise would more than com
pensate for the cost and difficul
ties involved.
Various companies were con
tacted and they agreed to pro
vide building' materials for the 
project at no cost to the school. 
These materials were all of an ex
perimental nature. Data was to 
be kept on the performance of the 
materials in actual use, and the 
information given to the various 
companies;
Plans were drawn up and all 
the preliminary steps taken. The 
administration had provided a 
sum of money to help in the 
building,, and the ground was even 
broken on the cut. And' then

New Honorary Constitutions 
Ar< Councils First Iteiorin
The reorganization of class honoraries is the first really con
structive piece of legislation that Student Council has pro
duced this year. With the exception of the rather low factor re
quirement, the new plan goes as far as anyone could wish in pro
viding a fair system of choosing members of the honorary so
cieties.
The new constitutions and point system are far from fool
proof. Some leeway had to be permitted. But this leeway has 
been reduced to a minimum.
The real merit of the new system lies in the fact that it pro
vides an opportunity for appeal, and also that it makes the entire 
process public. The rest is in the hands,of a watchful student 
body. If the students are not willing to take action against mis
use of authority, no reform is of any value.
The question of whether school honorarie^ are fairly or un
fairly administered is not of world-shaking importance, but in 
dealing with it Student Council has shown a disposition to take 
seriously those things which fall within its sphere of jurisdiction.
For the first time it can be said that renewed student interest 
in student government is bringing results. Perhaps when the 
committee seeking lower street car rates announces its results, we 
will have further cause for congratulations.
Humors of Press Censorship 
Follow Lease-Lend Passage
The passage of the Lease-Lend Bill leaves no doubt that 
Americas drift toward war is going to be greatly accelerated. 
Whether that in itself is good or evil is still open to discussion.
But the drift toward war is apparently bringing with it 
some things which are indefensible even by advocates of immedi
ate intervention. In addition to the growing un-democratic witch
hunt by various amateur and professional ealamity-howlers, there 
appears to be in the making a genuine honest-to-goodness Pro
paganda Ministry.
Uncensored reports that there is before Congress a bill, H. 
R. 3688, asking for a million and one-half dollars to expand the 
Office of Government Reports. The OCR is at present headed 
by Mr. Lowell Mellett, a very honest liberal-minded capable 
journalist.
Enlarging the OGR, coming on the heels of moves toward 
voluntary censorship initiated by Secretary of the Navy 
Knox, has caused newsmen in Washington to wonder.
Editor and Publisher has already described plans for a war
time propaganda bureau. Lowell Mellett has denied the story.
But there is enough substance and persistence to these 
rumors to indicate the trend. They certainly tie in with other 
M-Day plans.

French Club Host 
To Mrs. Mayer
Tonight at its regular monthly 
meeting, to be held at 8:15 in the 
Union, the French club will play 
host to Mrs. Raoul Mayer, a 
prominent authority on French. 
Mrs. Mayer lias for several years 
been the President of the local 
French club, Le Foyer Francais, 
which is composed of the native 
French living in Pittsburgh. Her 
talk to the club will be about 
Switzerland. Mrs. Mayer is par
ticularly well qualified to speak 
on the subject since she herself is 
of Swiss-French descent.
The evenings entertainment also 
includes a musical program con
sisting of a group of French songs 
to be sung by Miss Martha Henzi, 
a student in the Music Depart
ment, and Mrs. Carroll, the wife 
of the club's faculty adviser, will 
bo the accompanist. Refreshments 
will be served.

New Tea System 
Devised By Cweus
A neW system has been devised 
by Cwens for the purpose of meet
ing 'the freshmen, and determining 
their successors. Beginning to
day at 4:30 in the Union, the 
Cwens will hold their first in a 
series of teas.
The freshmen have been di
vided into four groups according 
to their schedules, and four separ
ate teas will be held for them. 
Formality will be done away with, 
since everyone is supposed to come 
directly from their classes. The 
Cwens hope that this new system 
will enable them to determine who 
is best fit to act as next years 
Cwens.
arent going to the I. F. Well, it 
isnt really importantweve seen 
so many ofl-campus men calling 
for the gals after meetings.
And Tata Von Horvath had to 
hide her pin at the last PiKLA 
party because Bob Reisachers 
father, who was present, didnt 
know that she and Bob are going 
steady. Oh, well, everyone else 
knows, huh?
Kate Curry has been hobbling 
around on crutches, obtaining her 
sprained leg skiing (of all things) 
with a night-schoolite Ev Stetson.
Kay Freese has finally joined 
the list of steadiesher choice 
being lucky Jack Murray.
Ruth C Brantlingers main topic 
of conversation in chemistry lab 
seems to be Bill Heinrich. After 
getting a peek at him the other 
day, we begin to see why.
Shirley Stine is certainly down
hearted these days. Seems Henry 
Roberts, her Brentwood B.-F., will 
be leaving soon to join the army! 
However, Will Rafferty and Don 
Thomas are not kicking. Better 
be careful, boys, the draft may 
have the last laugh!
Some of the few Tech gals go

with Frank Keck, Marion Morris 
witfi Jack Rhodes, and Tistie 
Weaver with Dave Wallis.
Council Contracts 
Dorsey; Approves 
Constitutions
Student Council, at its regular 
meeting last Tuesday, finally ap
proved the revised constitutions of 
the Scimitars and of the Drag
ons.
The minimum factor for en
trance to these class honoraries 
now stands at 1.75, the same as 
that required for entrance to the 
Delta Skulls, the Junior Class 
Honorary.
The Points Committee read the 
revised list of points given for 
the various activities and also the 
number of points necessary for 
admittance to an honorary.
It was announced that Tommy 
Dorsey has been definitely con
tracted for the opening dance of 
Spring Carnival, but no mention 
was made of the orchestra that is 
to play for the formal dance.
Council announced that for the 
past several weeks it has been 
negotiating, along with Pitt and 
Duquesne, with the Pittsburgh 
Railways Company to secure low
er fares for college students who 
use the street cars. Officials of the 
Railways Co., however, have 
countered with the fact that they 
are heavily in debt and can make 
no concessions to any group.

Leading Parts 
Are Played By 
Veteran Dramats
The theme of the Beggars Op
era, John Gays play being pro
duced by the Department of 
Drama with the aid and direction 
of Mr. Lehman Engel, offers the 
fortunate dramats in the cast a 
rare chance to display their num
erous quirks of personality. The 
play will open today and will 
continue through this Saturday 
at the Little Theatre.
Ivory Door, Kind Lady, Mary 
of Scotland, and a play in the 
Chinese style, The West Cham
ber. She also participated in a 
pageant with Olsen and Johnson, 
and was a member of the Sacra
mento Light Opera Guild. Since 
coming to Tech she has played in 
House of Connelly, and in 
When We Were Married. Her 
chief ambition is to return to Sac
ramento and start a theatre with 
the help of her husband, to make 
use of the abundance of talent 
available there.
Lucy Lockit, the third side of 
the triangle, is played by Shirley 
Brown. Shirley likes musical work 
and dancing, a fact evidenced by 
her active participation in the 
Scotch and Soda revues during the 
past three years. She had a posi
tion at the Playhouse last season 
in the revue. In the Drama De
partment, she has had leading 
parts in House of Connelly, 
Stage Door, and Yes, My Dar
ling Daughter. She has also ap
peared in Liliom, and The 
Bat. Her plans are to continue 
acting after graduation, beginning 
with a summer stock company, 
followed by New York in the fall.
Mr. Engel, who came from New 
York to direct the piece, is popu
lar with the cast because of his 
consideration for the actors, his 
originality and the New York 
atmosphere he brings to Tech.
. . . m.NS V42g
n light comedy of great pop
ularity ever since its writing in 
the eighteenth century, the play 
provides much hilarity in the an
tics of Polly Peachum, Lucy Lock
it and Macheath, representing the 
three sides of a love triangle.
Cast in the leading role of Mac
heath is Carl Betz, late of the 
Duquesne University Drama De
partment and now a sophomore 
at Tech. His part is unusual for 
him, since he usually played se
rious roles, including Romeo and 
Juliet and in Rosmersholm 
while at Duquesne, and Uncle Bob 
in House of Connelly and a 
small part in Dawn in Lyonesse at Carnegie. He has also 
worked with Bascombes marion
ettes, and has played parts in the 
Fox Chapel summer theatre.
Betsey Durkee, who plays Pol
ly Peacham, is also a transfer, 
having spent three years in Sac
ramento Junior College before 
entering Tech. In Sacramento,

the director appointed by the 
Scotch and Soda Club to produce 
their spring revue this April, and 
a look at his varied and various 
accomplishments will convince 
anyone that Heres To You, is 
going to be a superlative show.
A special student in the 
Drama Department, as well as 
the very proud father of a sevenmonth old wonder named Suzanne 
(Drama 62) whom he and his 
wife call little Petinsky, John 
has had theatre experience rang

the Pittsburgh Playhouse produc

the Western Gateway Pageant of
1,000 people, on a 260-by 80-foot 
stage out in South Park. He has 
acted at the Playhouse in Ex

Gilbert and Sullivan productions, 
and right now has a part in the 
Drama Departments current 
show, The Beggars Opera.

so much directing in and around

Ever since we wrote the gossip column for our high school 
paper, (and a clrab and frustrating extra-curricular activity that 
was) people who forgive us our journalistic pursuits enough to 
speak to us have expressed wonder, indignation, and even horror 
at the way we persistently use the plural pronoun we instead 
of the singular pronoun (I)- We dont know why we do it 
its probably a result of having been brought up on a literary diet 
of Horace Greeley and the Rover Boys. Now, after nearly seven
teen years of school, it has caught up with us. But, with the 
grace of God, we only have nine more weeks left in our academic 
career. We cant change now. Were afraid that, for the rest of 
the year, at least, we will have to remain we.

We unwittingly let ourselves get dragged into an argument 
about the war the other evening. Just when we thought we were 
winning, someone produced a hellishly ingeniousallegory  
what if the house next door to you, were on firewhich, al
though only vaguely applicable to the point, completely silenced 
ns. (Forensics was never our metier). And today, someone has 
just called our attention to a sign in the office which says, Bread 
is the staff of life, but that is no reason why the life of our staff 
should be one continual loaf.  
Now, we dont at all say that the life of the TARTAN staff 
or of any staffshould be one continual loaf. But this is an 
example of a dangerous fascination that words have. Puns are 
all right when they are used by radio comedians, or by a select 
circle of friends in the privacy of the drawing-room. Puns are 
not all right, we think, when they are used to confuse the issutf 
Change staff to office force and loaf to waste time,

Two events have had a great effect on our mental state re
garding the ro'om where we usually study. Its a room that 
doesnt belong to our departmentit' isnt even in our build
ing, strictly speaking. But it has little lockers in it, one of which 
we promptly appropriated, (we have been living in terror ever 
since, for fear someone will lock it and our books will be gone 
forever. No one lias, so far, but an unknown individual put an 
electric stove in it three weeks ago and he hasnt; been heard from 
since.) The room has big, flat tables, too; even our somewhat 
precarious portable doesnt rock on it. It has central heating 
and liot and cold running diversions and we love it.
We thought it was our ownexcept for an occasional class 
now and thenuntil we went in there the other day and heard 
one freshman saying to another, I know what Hell you have to 
go through, and I.want to go through it with you. We fled,- 
thinking (rather objectively, under the circumstances) that it 
was nice of him to feel that way; after all, hed only known her 
since September. Turns out lie didnt really want to go through 
Hell with her at all; they were rehearsing a scene from a play.
We had just about recovered from that and come to regard 
the place as home again when we had another shock. Sailing 
blithely in one day this week, we discovered two boys working 
busily over a little white bundle that emitted horrid and pro
testing squeaks every now and then. Thinking wildly that we 
had stumbled in on an infanticide, we demanded, in our best 
Dorothy Thompson tone, what were they doing? They looked up 
brightly. Oil, just diapering a bagpipe, they said.

when we painfully got down from the table and went over to pet 
him, lie walked majestically away. Started us thinking about our

Like some people with sauerkraut, we love dogs, but they 
dont love us. They arent hostile to usexcept for one small

John studied for four years at 
Tech some time ago, under Pro

back again to study more be
cause, as he explains it, he. is 
primarily interested in recrea

A Winning Team!
Tech Debaters Win Tri-State 
Championship; Are Undefeated
n3a.I3L D2AII uoFo4A4U DoFIR.RER.oFI
Carnegie Techs debate team re
turned home last week after 
clinching the Trie-State champion
ship by winning the Slippery Rock 
State Teachers College tourna
ment having triumphed over eigh
teen teams representing fourteen 
other colleges. Among their op
ponents were Case, University of 
Akron and Grove City.
Carnegies winning team is com
posed of Jack Van Arsdell 43, 
Cieo Bateman 43, John Horth 43, 
and Wayne Johnson 43. This team 
first laid claims to the champion
ship by winning the Westminster 
College tournament, defeating 
seventeen teams including Penn 
State, Pitt and West Virginia.
Inventions Wanted
At present the Tartans are 
meeting other colleges in prac
tice debates in preparation for 
the Grove City meet on March 21, 
and for an extensive tour of the 
South including the Grand East
ern Debate Tournament at Rock 
Hill, South Carolina. An average 
of four debates a week are held.
Last week Allen Martin 43, and 
Edward McGhee 43, journeyed to 
West Virginia University and de
bated before a high school audi
ence in the afternoon and over the 
radio in the evening. On Wed
nesday Jack Van Arsdell and 
Wayne Johnson debated Pitt over 
station KDKA. Cleo Bateman and 
Wayne Johnson debated the 
Mount Mercy team.
Under the provisions of the 
newly approved constitutions of 
class honoraries, the membership 
of the Points Committee is as fol
lows: president of Interfratemity 
Council; president of Dormitory 
Council; president of Citcom Clan 
or their representatives. All mem
bers are to be seniors. This com
mittee will make the final awards 
of membership to the honoraries.
The honor societies are respon
sible to Council for those activi
ties which concern the entire stu
dent body. They will not have an 
individual account but will act as 
agents of Council in all financial 
matters.
Following are the essential fea
tures of the revised constitutions
of the three class honoraries, as 
approved by Student Council.

Do you have inventive ability? 
Can you design a device to help 
America re-arm? If so, your ideas 
and inventions are wanted by the 
National Inventors Council in 
Washington, D. C.
It has become evident that the 
World War today is a conflict of 
inventions. As soon as one side 
introduces a new secret weapon, 
the other side spares no expense 
in obtaining the same weapon or 
a better one. A single idea may 
decide the whole victory.
Inventors Rewarded
Every amateur as well as pro
fessional. inventor in the country 
is urged to send in whatever 
plans, 'designs, ideas, etc., that 
he has worked out which he 
thinks may be useful for national 
defense. Ideas will not be paid 
for, but will be turned over to 
the Army, Navy, or other depart
ment and terms will be negotiat
ed by those bodies. All ideas 
should be sent to the National In
ventors Council, Chamber of 
Commerce Building, Washington,
D. C. Those who have no ideas 
at present, but would like to. de
velop some new device or process 
can think about the following: a 
cement for connecting rubber and 
metal, more accurate viscositymeasuring devices, a steel capable 
of resisting 150,000 pounds per 
square inch without yielding, a 
durable paint for the bottom of 
Ships, a method of employing the 
wasted heat-energy in airplane ex
haust gases, non-scale-forming 
boilers, etc. The number of new

the average Techlte knows only 
that construction suddenly stop
ped, leaving trenches bn' the cut as 
the ghost of a plan that had died. 
One is led inevitably to the con
clusion that there must have been
rat in the pantry somewhere, 
and that the benefits planned for 
died with the rest of the scheme. 
The first conclusion is true. The 
rat, in this case, was the sudden 
vanishing of the building mate
rials. Certain companies which 
had tentatively promised mate
rials were suddenly attracted by 
the sudden wealth tobe had in 
the manufacturing of war mate
rials. Other companies had set 
up working machinery for manu
facturing the new materials, but 
,could not provide them in time 
for the construction. However, 
some companies, old faithfuls 
(that they were, stuck to their 
promises; and their offers are still 
available.
The second conclusion that no 
benefit was derived from the ven
ture is entirely erroneous. The 
experience gained by student arch
itects, household economics, elec
tricals, and heating and ventilat
ing engineers was almost as great 
as it would have been if the house 
had actually been built. Mechan
ical details of construction could 
.easily have been handled by the 
students if the materials had been 
forthcoming.
At present the committee in 
charge plans to construct a build
ing more useful to Tech students. 
The type has not been definitely 
decided upon. It will, however, 
be on another part of the campus; 
and the present eyesore will be 
removed by the Department of 
Buildings and Grounds in the 
spring.
arming program is almost endless.
With the idea in mind of or
ganizing professional and ama
teur inventive power in this coun
try, three men went to Harry 
Hopkins in July when the latter 
was Secretary of Commerce. These 
men were Lawrence Langner, 
New York patent attorney, Thom
as Midgley, inventor of ethyl gas
oline, and .Conway Coe, United 
States Commissioner of Patents. 
With the approval of the Presi
dent, the National Inventors 
Council resulted.
Origin Of Council
Charles F. Kettering, President 
of General Motors Research Cor

Alpha Phi Omega has just had 
the pleasure of showing around 
another group of friendly neigh
bors. This time it was a group of 
civil engineers from the Uni
versity of' Chile, Santiago de 
Chile.
On Thursday afternoon about a 
dozen Chilean engineering stu
dents came to see Tech. They were 
taken to the Printing Depart
ment and the machine shop down 
in the Management Engineering 
Department. They showed partic
ular interest in the Mechanical 
workshop down in Machinery 
Hall. In the short time they had, 
they visited the hydraulic lab, 
the materials testing lab, and the 
coal research lab.
The drama students were re
hearsing The Beggars Opera 
when the Chileans visited the Lit
tle Theatre. But they seemed to 
be impressed very much by the 
equipment of our laboratories. 
One of them could not possibly 
understand what a printer could 
learn in four years.
Mr. Sergio Delano, a junior en
gineer from Santiago, told me 
some interesting details of their 
trip, and of how things are down 
in Chile. This visit to the United
States is sponsored by different 
Chilean societies. When they land
ed in New York, they were re
ceived by Mrs. Roosevelt before 
going on to the University of 
North Carolina, where they took 
a special course. Most of them 
will be in this country for three 
months, but some intend to stay 
longer.
The Civil Engineering course in 
Chile takes six years, and, accord
ing to Senor Delano, is extreme
ly tough. Their laboratories are 
not very good., but they have to 
learn a huge amount of theory.
As regards Panamericanism, 
Senor Delano said, We Chileans 
feel very strongly about it. We 
do our utmost to get acquainted 
with our great Northern friend, 
the States; it is up to the North 
Americans to do the same and 
come down to Chile to see what 
we have to offer. They would be 
surprised . . .
There is one thing in this coun
try that Senor Delano dislikes: 
the free and easy relations be
tween co-eds -and boys. It is go
ing a bit too far he said. He 
seems to get around anyway, be
cause he added, I am talking 
from experience.

Rouault, about half of which art ! 
rendered in color.
Rouault was an expressionist, 
although born in the gay impres
sionist period of French Art, in 
1871. His pictures are unusual; 
instead of being like the bright 
paintings of the art of his time, 
they are somber, even morbid. 
They have, however, the touch of 
an inspired artist.
His early vocation of stained 
glass work is evident in his mosiac effects of black lines and 
bright spots of color. The exhibi
tion shows Rouaults versatility 
in etching and lithographic tech
niques; a versatility that has en
abled him to disregard completely 
the usual mode of expression af
forded by these mediums.

ITS simple logic: You get nothing from a cigarette until 
you light it. For the qualities you enjoy are in the smoke 
itself. The smokes the thing.
And those qualities depend considerably upon the way 
your cigarette burns.
Camels burn slowerdefinitely. Thats a well-established

Tech Ends Season 
With No Victories
Penn State and 
Titans Defeat 
Tech Hoopsters
Winding up a perfect season, the 
Carnegie Tech basketball team 
absorbed two more defeats on last 
Wednesday and Saturday night 
at the hands of Penn State and 
Westminster respectively. The 
Penn State game was fairly close, 
the State boys winning by a 42-32 
score; but the game at New Wil
mington was a one-sided affair, 
the Titans winning by a 60-40 
count. These games were the sev
enteenth and eighteenth losses for 
Tech, setting a new record for 
Carnegie basketball teams. The 
former record was compiled in the 
late twenties when the team un
der John H. Irwin lost sixteen 
consecutive ' contests, but Max 
Hannums proteges went them two 
better to set a new record at 
eighteen in a row.
The fracas with Penn State on 
Wednesday night was probably 
the best game played in Skibo 
gym this season. Both teams play
ed good basketball, but State was
that much better than Tech to en
able them to leave with a second 
win at the expense of Carnegie. 
State played very conservative 
basketball, never taking a chance 
and playing every shot for a sure 
score. They played a very slow 
cutting game with All-American 
Johnny Barr playing the pivot. 
The Tech team kept pace with 
State the first half, the half-time 
score being sixteen up, but State 
forged ahead in the final periods 
to win by only ten points. The 
nearest Tech came to State was 
32-29, but they could not close 
the gap. Moffet was high man for 
State and Wally Patton was the 
leader for Tech with a. total of 
nineteen markers, playing his best 
game of the year. The spectators 
saw a new lineup for Tech in the 
persons of Burch, Patton, Holets, 
Fisher, and Hennessey which did 
a very creditable job.
On Saturday night, the Skibo 
basketeers journeyed to New Wil
mington to receive their final de
feat of the year at the hands of 
the Westminster Titans. The fin
al score was 60-40, the Titans be
ing on the long end of the score 
the entire game. Fox was high

In Pin Leagues
By JIM GEIST
Intramural bowling has become 
more or less settled as far as 
winners and percentage is con
cerned, although the lead in 
league B has changed hands. The 
high scoring records of last week 
stiil stand. The Delts and the Citcom Clan have possession of the 
top positions at the present time. 
Most of the expected winners 
came through as anticipated, but 
there are many matches to be 
played and any tiling can happen 
in.the remaining time.
The standings for the first three 
places in both leagues are:
League A
TeamWLPet.
Delta Tau Delta , . ,. .132.866
Pi Kappa Alpha . . .123.800
Beta Theta Pi......... .123.800
. . 78.466
League B
. 141.933
, 93.750
Senior Mechanicals.. 66.500
The few forfeits that have been 
entered in the books go to show 
the interest in Intramural bowl
ing. So far this year there have 
been one in each league. When 
a Tech sport, which is played Sat
urday afternoon can attract so 
many men regularly every week 
with as few lapses as bowling has, 
the importance and interest stands 
for itself. And to add something 
for the hard work of many and 
to stimulate the interest of others, 
a small award should be given to 
the men. and the team holding top 
honors.
man for Westminster and Wally 
Patton was again the leader for 
Tech with ten points for the sec
ond time during the week. Ran

captain of the team with eight 
points to his credit.

Tech had a very tough week 
as far as swimming is concerned. 
They lost a hard luck meet to W. 
& J. by a score of 39 to 36, which 
was decided by the final 400 yard1 
relay. But the crowning defeat 
was last Saturday when Tech took 
last place out of 8 teams in a 
championship meet at Rutgers.
In the W. & J. meet, Tech lost 
the 300 yard medley relay, but 
took second and. third places in 
the 200 yard freestyle. .Captain 
Molvie held up his end by talcing 
a first in the 50 yard dash. Brown 
took a first in the diving event and 
again Molvie took a first in the 
100 yard freestyle. Vajda and 
Loper took second and third in 
the 200 yard breaststroke. W. & 
J. took a first in the 150 yard 
backstroke, but Martin took a 
second. Boehmig won the 440 yard 
freestyle and Turnock took a sec
ond. W. & J. won the final event, 
the 400 yard relay, which gave 
them the meet by a score of 39 
to 36.
In the championship meet at 
Rutgers, Tech pitted three men 
against seven other teams and lost 
all but one event which was the 
150 yard backstroke. In this 
Molvie took a sixth which gave 
the Skibos their solitary point.
FOR skilful maneuvering on and off the dance 
floor, theres a simple prescription: Wear an 
Arrow dress shirt.
The Lido for tails is smoothly tailored and has a 
narrow bosom which is moored 
firmly in place with suspender

Equally smart for tux or summer

Hoopsters Finish Season
Last Saturday evening at approximately two hours before 
midnight the Skibo floor squad closed their 1940-41 floor season by 
dropping their eighteenth straight contest". The victors on this 
gala occasion were, another one of our subsidized opponents, the 
Titans of Westminister College.
Now that it is all over and we have more or less annointed 
all our wounds, there is a terrific tendency on the part of all of 
us who have more than a passing interest in old Carnegie to feel 
somewhat embarrassed by the whole thing. However, despite the 
fact that we certainly are not proud of our squads record, we 
should feel far from embarrassed when we stop to realize what 
the squad, and Maxie had to fight against. As has been said many 
times before, every team Tech played was supported by two or 
more boys who were receiving some financial help in exchange for 
their basketball ability, while the men composing the Tartan ag
gregation were present simply because they loved the game and 
possessed some basketball ability.
Having finished this gloomy season, it is my belief that steps 
should be taken to make certain that in the future our squad 
will not be forced to play under the same conditions. As I see it, 
there are three alternatives: first, give financial assistance to some 
boys with exceptional basketball ability; second, if possible, 
schedule basketball games with teams who have an athletic policy 
similar to our own; and third, drop inter-collegiate basketball 
entirely and concentrate on producing an active intramural con
test. These are my suggestions, if you or you have any further 
ideas the athletic board would welcome your suggestions.
Dorm Men Come Through
At the last home basketball contest, the dorm men combined 
to present an organized cheering section complete with white 
shirts and plaid dinks. Under the direction and supervision of 
John Horth who served as instigator and cheer leader this aggre
gation introduced several new yells that still ring in the ears of 
those who were present, and that should certainly be introduced 
to the school at large. From the information available we learn 
that Mr. Frank Eyman and Buddy Overend served as the spon
sors for this unique idea, and to them and the men who participat
ed the school owes a rousing vote of thanks.
Note to the conspicuously absent cheer leaders: You are miss
ing a good bet if you fail to enlist the services of John Horth 
whose spontaneous enthusiasm is the only recommendation lie 
needs.
Swimmers Close Season
Another group of Carnegie athletes closed their season dur
ing the past week by dropping their final contest to the Prexies 
of W&J. Handicapped by swimming in a foreign pool of an 
irregular length the swimmers failed to satisfy the pre-meet 
dopsters who had predicted a win for the sons of old Carnegie.

Pi Kappa Alpha downed the 
Betas to take possession of the 
volleyball trophy last Monday 
night. A stage full of rooters saw 
the Morewood men win the first 
game, only to have the Squirrel 
Hillers, sparked by Towering Ted 
Fishers smashing net play, come 
back in the second game and even 
the count at one all.
But the PiKAs turned on the 
heat to take the next two games 
by close margins. With the tally 
at 18 up in the final contest, they 
put over three straight service 
points on the fighting Betas to 
take the championship with a 21- 
18 victory.
Handball, Badminton and Squash 
Titles Won
Final standings in the ladder 
tournaments found Murray Lieblich of Tau Delta Pi at the top 
of the heap in handball, while the 
Badminton championship went to 
Heller of McGill Hall. A hot fight 
in the squash tourney saw Don 
Opel, Theta Xi entry, taking top 
honors by downing Mai Hawkes 
of Henderson Hall who placed 
second.
Citcom In Court Final
Citcom Clan, with only one 
scheduled game remaining, is a 
sure bet to represent the Inde
pendent League in the basketball
final which will be held on March 
25. Opposing them will probably 
be the red-hot SAEs who still 
have several contests to play be
fore clinching the title. Both 
teams are unbeaten to date, but 
the Clan looms as favorite to 
down the Violets by their terrific 
play during the entire schedule in 
which they practically annihilat
ed all the other teams in the In
dependent Circuit.
But the SAEs are plenty tough 
as evidenced by their consistent 
play all season, and especially by 
virtue of their upset triumph over 
the DUs who were touted as sure 
bets to walk'off with the Fraternity 
League crown at the beginning of 
the year.
Boxing, Wrestling and Swimming 
Tourneys Begin Soon
Next Wednesday is slated 
to be the date when Techs boxers 
will go into action in the cham
pionship bouts. About 30 leather 
pushers are expected to slug it out 
for top honors. On the following 
day the grunt and groaners will 
tussle for the wrestling crowns.
The swimming meets will be 
held some time during the week 
of the 24th. The same qualifying 
rules as last year are in effect, 
and no fellow can participate in 
more than two events and the re
lay.
By BETTY PARKER
Last week the basketball team 
played Duquesne. The ping pong 
tournament continued in iull 
swing, and badminton players al
so met Duquesne on the battle
field . . . and all for the love of 
the game. More meets are sched
uled, more fun, and more activ
ity. Just watch the bulletin boards 
or see the managers.
The Penn State conference to 
which delegates from Tech have 
been invited is in April, and we 
know you all want to go. Those 
who attended the gala affair .last 
year tell such wonderful tales of 
banquets, sports, new friendship 
and all around fun that we think 
youll all be clamoring for the 
chance this year. And so you wilL
Notices are going up onto the 
W. A. A. board, and those who are 
interested in a particular sport 
should sign your names. The dele
gates will be chosen from those 
persons who show that they are 
interested and if there are too 
many desiring to go out for one 
sport, the board will choose those 
girls who have participated to 
some extent in that sport. All de
cisions of the judges will be final.
Dance Club sponsored a grand 
exhibition of modem dancing 
done the modem way, and we 
vote thanks to the club for their 
bringing the dancers to us. More 
activity like that and Tech sports 
will be what we think Tech sports 
ought to be!

Jack Kennedys Band to Play 
For Elaborate Fine Arts Dance

The College of Fine Arts will 
hold its second dance of the year 
this Saturday night, in Thistle 
Hall.
The Fine Arts officers have dug 
into the roots of their ever dwind
ling pocketbooks and have gone 
to Grove City to hire the sweet 
music of Jack Kennedy and his 
Orchestra. Kennedys group is 
composed of twelve musicians, all 
of whom have many years of both 
individual and orchestral experi
ence behind them. The band pre
sents specialty numbers by the 
Sax Roamers, The Brass 
Tacks, The Five College Kids, 
Paul Kennedy, vocals by Hal Ross, 
and topping this list is the Kay 
Khoir, a well-developed, highly 
interpretative vocal unit. Hal 
Ross was recently featured on a 
series of sustaining programs . on 
the N. B. C. network.
The Arts dances have been 
noted for their novel and differ
ent decorations, so you can expect 
to see Thistle Hall decorated in a 
truly artistic manner. Painstak
ing care has been taken to secure 
new and more beautiful corsages 
and the officers have bought those 
that delight the fancy of your 
fair damsel. As usCial corsages will 
be given to the first 200 girls so 
be there early to insure yours.
Dancing will start a half-hour 
earlier than usual, at 8:30 and as 
necessary will culminate at mid
night.
Following is a list of the fac
ulty members who have been in
vited to chaperon the affair: Mr. 
and Mrs. Glendinning Keeble, Mr 
and Mrs. Dalziel McKelway, Mr. 
and Mrs. George P. McKinney, Mr. 
and Mrs. Wilfred A. Readio, Mr. 
arid Mrs. Dahlen Ritchey, Mr. and 
Mrs. Robert Shmertz, Mr. and Mrs. 
Raymond Simboli, Dr. and Mrs. 
Beryl E. Warden, Mr. and Mrs. 
Samuel Rosenberg, Mr. and Mrs. 
Clarence Overend.
The officers in charge of the af
fair are Fred Fargotstein, Presi
dent; John DeLuca, Vice Presi
dent; Lou Fosner, Secretary; Bob 
Metcalf, Treasurer, and Harold 
Geilman, Social Chairman.

The subject which hasoften 
been discussed comes to our at, tention again. The subject is none 
other .than that oft forgotten word 
SOCIABILITY.
I chanced to strike up a conver
sation with a fellow student who 
seemed quite disgusted with af
fairs in general and was even 
contemplating joining forces With 
our rival Pitt. One of the reasons 
for his discouragement was the 
fact that he had come to work 
for decorating the dance hall and 
had met with no social recogni
tion. At the time of parting he 
seemed quite enthused and had an 
entirely different attitude toward 
Tech, but as you may have al
ready guessed, the student in 
question never came to the work 
period. This is the attitude of too 
many of our students in regard to 
the work which has to be done.
At the smokers, which were 
held in the early stages of the 
school year, quite an enthusiasm 
was built up in the attending stu
dents. It seems many have lost 
their enthusiasm and the situation 
will arise again in which there 
will be too few eligible to hold 
office.

* TV
Stan Stolarczyk 
Selected for 
Industries Post
Stanley Stolarczyk, known to 
his friends as Stush represents 
the Evening College of Industries 
on the Evening Student Council 
as vice president of that college. 
He was chosen to that office by his 
fellow officers when a vacancy was 
created due to the ineligibility of 
one of the council members.
Spending all of his 25 years in 
the vicinity of Rankin, Pa., Stan
ley attended Braddock High 
School, where he pursued the gen
eral course of studies. He played 
varsity football for two years and 
was graduated in 1935. After 
loafing for a year Stanley enrolled 
at Tech in the sheet metal and 
structural drafting courses. lie 
hopes to receive his certificate 
from the College of Industries in 
the near future.
His. day time hours are spent at 
the Bethlehem Steel Company, 
where he has been working in the 
template shop for the past five 
years. (In case youre interested 
templates are patterns.) Besides 
the three nights that he spends in 
class Stanley enjoys swimming 
and dancing with his favorite girl, 
who is a brunette. They are par
tial to swing music and fond of 
jitter bugging. Besides his swim
ming he also plays quite a bit of mush ball during the summer 
months.
Stanley Is serving his first year 
as a member of the Evening Stu
dent Council. He has received the 
Evening Student Council Activi
ties Insignia and was called to the 
Nu Sigma Alpha Activities Hon
orary last year for his participa
tion in the Evening School Activi
ties.
His greatest bug-a-boo has been 
the inability of his friends to spell 
and pronounce his last name cor
rectly. Being spelled S-t-o-l-a-rc-z-y-k and pronounced as stolar-check it sends one in doldrums 
trying to keep it straight.

The College of Engineering has 
had some difficulty in keeping 
their Student Council officers this 
year. The beginning of the sec
ond semester saw a change of 
three Engineer Student Council 
Officers for various reasons. On 
a motion of Frank Carlos of In
dustries, David Pettigrew has been 
elevated from the position of Vicepresident to that of President of 
Engineering College. The new ap
pointments are Frank Amuso, 
vice-president; Ed Nuss, Treasur
er; and John Gore, secretary. Stu
dent Council regretted the loss oi 
Ronald E. Shoff who resigned be
cause of lack of time to fill the of
fice satisfactorily, Cecil McDer
mott who dropped out of school, 
and John Leister who also resign
ed because of difficulty in attend
ance hours per week.
The president of Evening Stu
dent Council and the Social 
Chairman met with the President 
of the Pittsburgh Local 60 and 
discussed the difficulty between 
the Union and the Evening Stu
dent Council. A mutual agree
ment was reached. Speaking on 
behalf of the Evening Student 
Council the president agreed to 
try to use some of the smaller 
union bands for the individual 
college dances.
The Greensburg Carnegie Techniters application to be recogniz
ed has been approved by Even
ing Student Council. Samuel 
Webb, the president has been no
tified to this effect, and has also 
been advised that the organization 
has been placed on the usual two 
year probation period.
Frank Carlos, Treasurer from 
Industries College has been elect
ed to fill the office of Treasurer of 
Evening Student Council for the 
remainder of the school year. This 
vacancy occurred through the res
ignation of Ronald E. Shoff.

Sigma Delta Phi 
Elects Officers
Sigma Delta Phi celebrated its 
first anniversary Sunday a week 
ago with a stag dinner held in theZebra Room of Gammons Hilanhouse.
The dinner, scheduled for 6:30, 
.began with a first course of soup, 
followed by steak, french fried po
tatoes, broccoli, rolls, coffee and 
dessert.
The following officers were re
elected for the coming year: Ches
ter Biscup, President; Bud Eckhardt, Vice President; J. Miller, 
Secretary; Harold Parks, Treas
urer.
Sigma Delta Phi was organized 
for the purpose of providing a 
means by which the day and night 
school could become better ac
quainted, and establishing a spirit 
of cooperation between the two' 
groups. It is the only social fra
ternity of its kind, on the campus, 
and since its inception, has held 
many successful social affairs, 
among which were several wellattended steak frys.
The fraternitys second year got 
off to a good start Saturday night 
with a party held at the Carnegie 
Union. The lads donned their 
best bibs and tuckers and turned 
out enmasse, but this time the gal 
friends tagged along.
There was the usual dancing to 
recorded music, and of course the 
recreation room in the basement 
was well patronized. At a late 
hour, refreshments were served.
