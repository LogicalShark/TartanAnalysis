STTFFINS ELECTED 
COA(I) FOR 1914
CHICAGO STAR WILL TEACH 
FOOTBALL.
NR. DAVID FAIRCNIID LETTER FRON 
VISITS SCHOOLS IKE DIRECTOR
DISCUSSES PROSPECTS OF 
CAMP LOUISE CARNEGIE
At a meeting of the Board of Con
trol of the Athletic Association, held 
Wednesday evening, January 21, that 
body voted to secure the services of 
Walter P. Steffiins as football coach 
for 1914. Mr. Steffins played quarter
back on the University of Chicago 
teams, and in 1910, his last year, was 
selected by experts as the best player 
at that position in America. He has 
spent the last three seasons as assist
ant to Coach A. A. Stagg, holding a 
position of great responsibility in the 
training of the chicago teams.
The recommendation was made by 
Director Hamerschlag through Mr. 
McCullough, Director of Activities. 
At Dr. Hamerschlags invitation, Mr. 
Steffins visited the Institute lately, 
meeting practically everyone interest
ed in the fortunes of football at Car
negie. The local conditions govern
ing the sport were presented to him in 
the most discouraging forms, questions 
on practical football were asked him1, 
and the records in the past were put 
before him. When his opinion was 
finally asked he expressed his willing
ness to assume the coaching respon
sibility, and, with all modesty, asserted 
that, with the usual material, he was 
certain he could improve results.
A letter of recommendation from 
Coach Stagg praised the work of Mr. 
Steffins, both as a player and as a 
coach, in glowing terms. Mr. Stagg 
may well be considered the foremost 
authority upon football in the West, 
and his assistant for three years should 
be well equipped for coaching the 
game. In his letter, Coach Stagg 
spoke of Mr. Steffins as the most bril
liant executor of the forward pass that 
has so far been developed, and stated 
that his directive and devising ability 
in regard to strategic football is un
surpassed.
Inasmuch as the Eastern style of 
football as coached with the Carnegie 
teams in the past has developed splen
did defensive squads, but has left the 
scoring machinery practically undevel
oped, those in control of athletics are 
making a bid for a change to the West
ern system. In consideration of this 
fact, as well as of the unusual qualifi
cations of the candidate, the Board of 
Control was unanimous in voting for 
Mr. Steffins.
Before the vote was taken, the rep
resentatives of the Alumni AssociaOn Saturday morning, one of the 
most distinguished men in the serv
ice of the United States Government 
visited our Schools and discussed the 
future of Camp Louise Carnegie. This 
famous personage was Dr. David Fair
child, the eminent botanist and plant 
hunter of the Department of Agricul
ture.
In an interview, Mr. Fairchild told 
the Tartan reporter that he was re
turning from the University of Wis
consin, where he had delivered a ser
ies of lectures to the students of the 
Agriculture College in regard to the 
bureau of which he is in charge, and 
of plant hunting in general. He ex
plained that his men did not hunt 
rare plants, but plants that would im
prove the agriculture conditions of the 
country. He also hunted plants in 
lands where conditions were similar 
to ours, for the purpose of finding 
substitutes for some of the declining 
crops of this country.
Mr. Fairchild, when asked if he ex
pected to take the field in the near 
future, replied that he was not sure. 
He said: I am expecting one of my
men back from Brazil shortly, and it 
depends upon his report, whether I 
go or not.
Mr. Fairchild returned to Washing
ton Saturday night.
Everybody is boosting the Prom, 
so get in line.
EXPLAINS IMPORTANT QUES
TION.
Has that girl been giving you some 
home cooked meals? Better take her 
to the Prom and youll get some 
more.
tion were asked for their position on 
the question of the choice of a coach. 
It had been understood that the grad
uates had been backing E. R. Snitzer, 
but their representatives expressed 
the opinion that the question had 
been reduced to one of systems of 
coaching, and, for the reason that a 
change should benefit the Institute, 
they would vote for Mr. Steffins.
It is understood that Mr. Steffins 
will arrive in Pittsburgh in the spring, 
if he accepts the position, and will start 
early practice before school closes. 
The fall season will also open early 
and the squad should be in line by the 
time class work starts next Septem
ber.
January 26th, 1914.
To the Editor of the Tartan:
On the eve of my departure for a 
vacation I want the privilege of bring
ing to the attention of the students 
a question which has been asked fre
quently, to-wit: What is the difference 
between an institute of technology 
and a college or university?
I find little or no difficulty in point
ing out one essential difference be
tween these types of institutions, a 
difference which goes beneath the sur
face consideration of curricula and 
methods of instruction. It seems to 
me patent that institutes of technol
ogy, if they are to fully express a 
characteristic note in education, must 
by necessity be guided by the profes
sional spirit whereas, colleges and 
universities are traditional growths 
which serve their constituency with
out being impelled or imbued by the 
attitude which must always cling to 
the professional spirit.
It is difficult to interpret this pro
fessional spirit except by examples 
which illustrate its modes of expres
sion. It is true that professional 
spirit cannot be attained during the 
adolescent period. It is the begin
ning of maturity. It accepts the bur
den of a career. It revels in the at
mosphere of absorption in the sci
ence, the art or the industry. It dis
associates itself from the trite and 
generally accepted traditional pro
gram of life. Searching the mass of 
accumulated knowledge the profes
sional student becomes the torchbearer of a new expression of life 
whose medium may be color, form, 
sound or contribution to the worlds 
knowledge, or the creation of a new 
edifice or a machine to lighten human 
toil.
Institutes of technology do not, as 
a matter of course, hold or pre-empt 
this phase of education to the exclu
sion of other educational institutions. 
They represent, however, a most mod
ern and concrete expression of this 
professional attitude in certain fields 
of science, art and industry. They 
claim the possibility of culture through 
emotions, through trained intelligence, 
through the utilization of plastic and 
non-plastic substances, whereas the 
old college ideal restricted the realm 
of culture to a study of the philoso
phies and the classics.

BOARD TRACK 
IS ERECIED
PRACTICE ALREADY BEGUN.
The track management took advan
tage of the spring days so opportunely 
provided last week by the weather 
man and had the board track erected. 
The sight of the track proved a wel
come one to many runners who lost 
no time in renewing or making its ac
quaintance. To the members of the 
1913 squad, it was the fore-runner of 
the coming season and the signal to 
start training.
With the track ready for use, the 
call for candidates is automatically an
nounced. Heretofore Tech has had 
very representative teams. To main
tain this record, an abundance of ma
terial from which to choose is essen
tial. The first scheduled indoor meet 
on February twenty-first, is but three 
weeks away, so that immediate prac
tice is necessary. Coach Dull will 
again have charge of the team and 
for that reason if for no other, our 
prospects are bright. Manager Miller 
has extended to Pitt the use of our 
track. If his offer is accepted, some 
lively trial races will probably be the 
result.
On Saturday night, Duquesne Gar
dens will be the scene of the opening 
indoor meet of the winter. Tech has 
not entered a team, but several Plaid 
runners will compete individually. 
Among the latter are King in the high 
jump, Dunseith in the quarter mile, 
and Hemmon in the sixty-yard dash. 
The first named has already estab
lished his reputation as a jumper and 
is almost certain of a place. If Dun
seith begins this season where he left 
off last spring he will cause his op
ponents lots of trouble. The last men
tioned runner is a Plebe, who is said 
to be a first rate sprinter. The efforts 
of these men will be watched with in
terest for they will be pitted against 
representatives from W. & J., Pitt, 
Penn State and other colleges in this 
vicinity.
REPRESENTS TECH IN 
CONTEST.
Mr. W. D. Jones, of the Department 
of English, School of Applied Indus
tries, was one of three judges in the 
recent essay contest given by the Uni
versity of Pittsburgh. The contest 
was open to pupils of the public 
schools. The subject of the essays 
was Why I would like to go to a 
University.

PITTSBURGH, PA., JAN. 29, 1914
DEAN BRIGGS OF HARVARD ON 
ATHLETICS.
At the annual meeting of the Amer
ican Collegiate Athletic Association, 
a report of which was published by 
us two weeks ago, a valuable address 
was delivered by Dean Briggs of Har
vard on Athletics. This has been re
printed in the Harvard Alumni Bulle
tin, and we are quoting herewith a few 
abstracts which may be of interest to 
the students.
He believes that sportsmanship in 
American colleges is steadily improv
ing. Twenty years ago, he says, foot
ball fostered manly courage, but it 
could not be said to foster manly 
frankness. Certain objectionable prac
tices wrere then considered praisewor
thy, which today could not be meas
ured politely by modern standards. 
Even out of those days came kindly 
and honorable men, hence it is no 
wonder that today the football type 
of man is one of the finest we pro
duce. He goes on to say that the 
gain in sportsmanship is no more mor
al than economic. With improved 
officials, slugging and other breaches 
of courtesy have ceased to pay, have 
accordingly become rarer, and, having 
become rarer, are, when they do occur, 
more noticeable. The player who is 
guilty of them is no longer the normal 
athlete, but a man marked in the sport
ing world as no gentleman, or at best, 
as an irascible gentleman who im
perils his own team. All this has a 
moral effect: for, however much men
ought to be above sordid considera
tions of reward and punishment, they 
are not.
One of the games in which such 
offenses are most conspicuous and 
most gratuitous is baseball. The eth
ics of professional baseball is no sub
ject for us except as it affects the 
ethics of college baseball. The public 
is so callous to anything short of bru
tality that good playersand good 
menregard it as part of what they 
are paid for to unnerve an opponent 
by fair means or by foul. Men and 
boys have come to think of this un
nerving as a great point in the game, 
with which it has no more intrinsic 
connection than with any other game. 
A player may hold an opponent up to 
ridicule before thousands of specta
tors; a catcher may gibe at the bats
man in plain hearing of the umpire 
without one word of effective rebuke.
I am not citing the worst things 
men do; nor am I questioning the 
right of any player to make an occa
sional spontaneous remark; nor am 
I denying that even in baseball things 
are not so bad as they were. I am 
pointing out cases in which players 
who should be gentlemen show that, 
for the time being, they are not, and 
receive no public rebuke for contempt
ible public conduct. Repressing such 
conduct by law will not transform the 
spirit that prompts it, but will create, 
in time, such a habit of decency as 
shall restore in some degree the stu
dents sense of proportion, a sense of 
proportion that many a youth who is 
not radically unfair-minded has lost.
It is so obvious that modern base
ball misuses the mouth and abuses 
sportsmanship, so obvious that part of 
an umpires duty is to see fair play, so 
obvious that the normal youth loves 
the generous, hates the trickily mean, 
and need only open his long-closed 
eyes to see that there is nothing legiti
mate to baseball which will not suffer 
a player to remain a gentleman. I 
discuss but one game and make but 
one suggestion; yet the principle of 
that suggestion applies to all games 
and to every contest. Every little we 
can do to make clean our national 
game helps our citizens to make clean 
the greater game of our national life, 
for clean sport makes honest men.
THE TECHNOLOGY MERGER.
Of great interest, in educational cir
cles is the recent merger of the courses 
in Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Sani
tary, Mining and Metallurgical Engi
neering at Harvard with similar 
courses given at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology. Against a great 
deal of criticism and distrust from1 the 
alumni of both institutions, the agree
ment was finally consummated, and is 
to take effect as soon as the new Tech 
buildings are completed. Under the 
conditions of the plan, neither school 
will lose its identity, yet the peculiar 
advantages of each will become mu
tual. Both students and faculty will 
enjoy equal rights and privileges as 
to degrees, titles, etc., in the two 
schools.
With regard to this merger a most 
interesting editorial recently appeared
in the Boston Daily Advertiser, from 
which we are taking the liberty of 
quoting. In this editorial there is a 
most gratifying mention of the work 
of our own institution.
We have always maintained that 
the merger of course could be accom
plished without the slightest danger 
to the existence of either of the insti
tutions involved in the agreement. 
And we feel that, in this opinion, we 
are now supported by every loyal 
alumnus of either institution who is 
conversant with existing conditions 
and with the plans for the co-operative 
system which will be put in operation, 
if the recommendations are carried 
Out.
As a matter of fact, both Harvard 
and the Institute of Technology will 
be all the stronger in their appeals to 
the ambitious student, because of this 
plan of common effort in the engineer
ing courses. The combined school has 
special advantages to offer to the 
students in both institutionsadvan
tages which might never have been so 
strong and so striking, if the plan of 
co-operation had not been adopted by 
the two faculties and the two corpora
tions.
In urging immediate action we said 
that nothing could be gained and 
something might easily be lost. The 
reasons for that statement are almost 
self-evident to those who appreciate 
what far-reaching and important plans 
are being considered at other techni
cal schools of the country, notably in 
the Carnegie Institute at Pittsburgh. 
It is urgently necessary that the tech
nical schools of this section should be 
prepared to offer better and better 
inducements, in the future, than they 
have offered in the past, if they are to 
hold the high rank they have won. 
They cannot afford to stand still.
THE BEANERY.
The new addition to the Industries 
Building is nearing completion as rap
idly as the weather will permit. Each 
week we are nearer the new commons 
that has been promised. The com
mons, or as it is popularly known, 
the beanery, is now a great eyesore 
to every student at Carnegie, whether 
he is forced to patronize it or not. 
The building is a disgrace to the Insti
tute.
The building was only a temporary 
structure for the beanery, and was 
not designed to accommodate the 
large number of students now at 
school. Not that all of them patron
ize it, but each year that the num
bers of students is increased, there are 
more at the commons. Most of the 
days during the week it is so crowded 
that underclassmen are forced to use 
either Faculty tables or Senior tables. 
This crowding may be because many 
students who bring lunches eat them 
in the commons, hence depriving of 
seats those who do not bring lunches 
and find it necessary to eat there. At 
least half of the tables are taken up 
in this manner. In order to eliminate 
the crowding, tables should be re
served for those bringing their lunch
es.

A DIAMOND DRILL OUTFIT 
AND THE COST OF SET
TING IT UP.
About a year ago I was interested 
in exploring for iron ore, at that time 
having charge of seven diamond drills 
on three of the iron ranges. In the 
present article I am going to give the 
full data and cost figures in an actual 
case of a diamond drill which I set 
up and had charge of on the Menomi
nee Iron Range, Michigan.
The outfit consisted of a boiler com
plete with fittings, a diamond drill 
engine, Sullivan Type H and fit
tings complete; a Cameron pump with 
all fittings; a churn drill with fittings 
complete; a tripod, three legs 34 feet 
long for 20-foot pulls, 45 feet long 
for 30-foot pulls; and a sheave wheel 
15 inches in diameter. Eighty feet of 
good 1-inch Manila rope; a tool box 
with all extra fittings and tools com
plete; 400 feet of 3-inch extra heavy 
casing; 3,000 feet of 2-inch pipe; 500 
feet of light pipe for wash rods in 
churn drilling.
The accommodations for the men 
consisted of one sleeping camp 12 by 
14 feet; one cook camp 14 by 18 feet; 
and one setting shanty 8 by 12 feet.
The complete diamond drill outfit 
weighed approximately 25,000 pounds 
when loaded on the car. When ship
ping a diamond drill outfit one is like
ly to be up against most anything; a 
set up in the woods may mean ex
treme difficulty in securing teaming. 
The above outfit of 25,000 pounds was 
unloaded by two other men and my
self in just a little over five hours.
It took just exactly five days from 
the time the drill outfit landed until 
it was set up and in operation. The 
most serious difficulty was encoun
tered in hauling the outfit seven miles 
across wooded country. In some 
places roads had to be cut, in others 
the extreme weight of the boiler, drill, 
pipeSj etc., made the wagons sink into 
the ground to the hubs and required 
the use of the teams to pull them out. 
Heavy dray horses can seldom be pro
cured within miles of the location of 
the drill. The drive is often made 
straight across country, over hills, 
through creeks and swamps, and it is 
not an infrequent occurrence for a 
wagon to nearly topple over, due to 
running over hidden tree stumps.
This drill outfit was set up where 
there were no roads at all, and in one 
place part of the coal and half of the 
pipe had to be thrown off in order to 
get out of a sink-hole and up a hill. 
Two teams were all the available 
horses that we could get and these 
could make but two trips each day 
and then it required working late into 
the night. The extreme difficulty of 
procuring heavy teams has already 
been mentioned.
In addition to the above work con
cerning the drill outfit, arrangements 
have to be made for the comfort of 
the men. There were four men at 
this camp, a cook, a setter and a drill 
runner, and two helpers. A complete 
line of heavy bedding must be furn
ished; also cooking utensils and stock 
groceries. The complete initial ex
penditure runs from $200 to $400.
The following are the most import
ant costs:
Camp Tents $25.20 
Cost of Teams $66.25 
Bills for first outlay of camp provisions 
$71.53
Cost of board and team's long enough 
to get camp set $24.30 
(This was seven miles from the loca
tion of drill)
One car of coal shipped from Escanaba, Mich. $79.56 
(Two carloads necessary to complete 
the drilling.)
Lumber in Setters Shanty $17.58 
(The above shanty was used to set 
diamond bits.)
Floor and sides for tents $15.00 
Diamond Drill Shanty $20.00 
One shanty for cooking and eating in 
$20.00 
Wages of men:
Cook $50.00 per month 
Supt. $4.00 per day 
Setter $4.25 per day 
Drill runner $3.25 per day 
Drill helper (two$2.50 per day 
My expense account .for this month 
totaled $80.00, which did not include 
my salary. The above costs cover all 
of the main items of expense. Rail
road fare and extras are included under 
expenses.
The grand total was $500.00.

The high cost of living can be easily 
deduced by some of those who eat 
at the beanery, when they take into 
account the high prices paid for food 
and the amount that will have to be 
paid out for doctors bills in the fu
ture. The prices for most of the food 
served there is almost prohibitive for 
the majority of the students at Car
negie. The restaurants at Oakland 
are often cheaper, but because of the 
nearness to school the beanery is pat
ronized more. Most eating houses of 
Oakland are notably poor, but the 
food served at the commons is no bet
ter.
One way to obtain better service, 
better prices and better food would be 
to have the commons directly under 
school supervision. The prices could 
then be regulated, and be made cheap
er.
If we have the new commons, it is 
hoped that there will be a change for 
the better in every way. And if we 
are not to have the new commons, the 
time to start a betterment is now.

Th is Is a Very Good Time 
To Think AboutClothes
A man can purchase himself a first-class suit or overcoat here at 
this time at surprisingly small cost.
We are getting down close to the seasons end and the prices that 
will take these last suits and overcoats are scarcely realizeable.
Young men who appreciate how much a mans appearance counts 
for in both the business and the social woild will be very glad of the 
opportunity that is thus presented for a needed suit or handy topcoat 
to round out the fullness of their wardrobes.
For $ 15.00
Any man may choose from an excellent selection of good-fitting, 
well-tailored all wool suits the regular prices of which were $20.00 
to $30.00. The assortment includes both plain and fancy woolens, 
in a variety of latest styles from the sharp cut English models to the 
more conservative American type of business suits.
At $10.00 and $14.50
There is a fine selection of Winter Overcoats, the former prices 
of which were up to $30.00. Practically every style of the season 
is included in both groups, and any young man should be able to find 
a smart coat to his taste that will be a first-class investment for 
next winter.

of identification. As each person en
tered he was given a program much 
like a dance program, except that in
stead of the gentlemen asking the 
ladies for dances, they asked to be 
allowed to converse with them on 
certain set subjects. This provoked 
much merriment.
After the talk-fest was ended, the 
time was given to music and games, 
jntil the blinking of the lights warned 
us that only time enough remained 
for us to get our wraps and leave be
fore the lights would go off.
Everyone had a very enjoyable

It has been decided that the Tango

on this occasion.
RECEPTION TO HIGH SCHOOL 
SENIORS.
The Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School rang with the real college spirit 
last Saturday afternoon when the As
sociation of Collegiate Alumni of 
Pittsburgh entertained the Seniors of 
the high school of the vicinity. This 
reception was held with the idea of 
helping the girls of the high schools 
to choose their college.
The guests were met in the hall by 
the representatives of the various col
leges, who provided each girl with the 
color of the college which they repre
sented. The Margaret Morrison Girls 
then took the Seniors in charge and 
escorted them through the building 
and thence to the gymnasium.
An interesting program was ar
ranged by Miss McKenzie, chairman 
of the committee. Miss Coolridge of 
the Pennsylvania College for Women
was chairman of the entertainment. 
She delivered the address of welcome 
to which Miss Breed responded. Sev
eral selections were rendered by the 
Mandolin Club of the P. C. W. and 
the Glee Club of the M. M. C. S. Mrs. 
Henry M. Hallett, of Mt. Holyoke, 
gave a talk on the advantages of the 
big colleges while Mrs. Porter of P. 
C. W. gave her views on the advan
tages of the small colleges. The talk 
on co-educational colleges was deliv
ered by Mrs. J. W. Magaw, of the 
University of Indiana, and Miss Lyon 
talked on technical schools for girls.
Letter from the Director
Continued from Page 1
Schools of technology borrow from 
a study of natures moods inspiration 
and vitality, and they accept their re
sponsibilities for performing an edu
cational mission different from that 
which a typical college or university 
has nurtured through the ages.
The Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy represents a very modern expres
sion of this ideal. It has found it to 
its advantage to absorb and utilize 
and to make part of itself some of the 
spirit which exists in those other tra
ditional educational establishments. It 
has likewise taken on characteristics 
of the professional spirit which dif
ferentiates it from the typical college. 
Witness the absorption of the students 
in the School of Applied Design dur
ing charette week; the intense appli
cation of the students of Applied Sci
ence in the solution oi engineering 
problems, the concentrated effort with 
which the students of Applied Indus
try work in the construction shops; 
and the intense loyalty to the ideals 
of the home which permeates the 
Womans School, and which dignifies 
the simplest of domestic tasks as be
ing worth while.
In different localities of the United 
States, certain colleges and universi
ties have a single department in which 
this spirit prevails. At Johns-Hopkins it exists to a remarkable degree 
in the field of medicine; at Clark Uni
versity, in the field of psychology; at 
Harvard in the field of law; from other 
institutions we might pick isolated ex
amples. At the institutes of technol
ogy this same professional spirit per
meates every activity, every course in 
instruction, and it is this phase of 
scholarship which develops the only 
possible form of educated citizenship 
to place beside the graduates of its 
time-honored and respected competi
tors.
Arthur A. Hamerschlag, 
Director.

the Tech Design Club has changed the 
date of their dance from February 4th

A SYMPOSIUM ON TECH SPIRIT
In the college world we hear much 
of the Spirit of this or that institution. 
Let a graduate meet an undergraduate 
and among the first questions that 
arise is, Well, how is the spirit of the 
school now? The answer may be 
the spirit is fine or there doesnt 
seem' to be the same old spirit any
more. From that we take it that a 
spirit is variable and is subject to 
change like the weather. And there 
is a reason for this.
Take one of the older institutions 
of learning, and it is noticeable that 
there are times of depression of spirit 
and there are seasons when it is at its 
height. Then, too, the spirit seems 
to take a different aspect every so 
often, depending largely upon the 
make-up of the student body. The 
size of an institution also influences 
it to a large extent. A small school 
is apter to have more spirit than a 
large school. This is due to the fact 
that the students are better acquaint
ed with one another, there is a closer 
bond of sympathy between the stu
dent and faculty, and the enthusiasm 
that naturally arises under such con
ditions is spontaneous. In the larger 
institution, of necessity the spirit is 
likely to be more mechanical, depend
ing largely upon the personal magnet
ism of the organizer, the cheer-leader, 
etc.
Here at Tech, there is a unique con
dition of affairsIn less than a decade 
the school has grown from the mere 
idea of a big hearted man to one of 
the larger institutions of this country. 
Our students are recruited from all 
ranks of society. It is cosmopolitan 
in the strictest sense of the word. 
The large faculty is made up of men 
who are specialists either from a pro
fessional or from a practical stand
point. It would seem almost impos
sible to get so many men together in 
one faculty with such varying duties 
to perform. The work of the four 
schools is as different as the four col
ors which distinguished the individual 
schools. But just as these colors taken 
together make the Carnegie Tartan, 
so I take it all the varying ideals of 
the groups of students and the amount 
and kind of inspiration of the faculty 
members of the separate schools, have 
a part in developing the Carnegie 
spiritAnd who shall say that we lack 
in spirit!
Imbued by the enthusiasm of the 
Founder himself, a large share of the 
impetus of Tech spirit must come from 
the members of the Faculty. We too 
often neglect this phase of the ques
tion. It seems to me that if a double 
portion of the spirit of Carnegie is 
to fall upon any body of men, it should 
be upon the heads of the administrat
ing and teaching forces of the school. 
That member of the faculty does not 
perform his whole duty to the school 
who is satisfied alone with being at 
his place behind the desk or in the
laboratory or in the shop in the capac
ity of instructor. Nor does he com
plete his usefulness when he assumes 
the commendable role of acting as ad
viser in this or that matter not exact
ly in the curriculum. He owes his 
entire enthusiasm1 to the school. Its 
up to him to throw an atmosphere of 
enthusiasm around the student. A 
snob of a teacher, or group of instruc
tors, is pretty sure of making a snob 
of a student, or a group of students. 
Real college spirit can never thrive in 
an atmosphere of snobishness.
To come more directly to the point, 
as a faculty, we must co-operate to a 
man in encouraging student activities, 
first in our own schools, but with the 
thought of the whole school in mind. 
For after all, the team that repre
sents Tech on the field or on the track 
or on the indoor arena, must be an 
all-schools team if the spirit be right.
I believe, moreover, that each mem
ber of the Faculty ought to go out of 
his way, if such step be necessary, 
to attend the various athletic, scholas
tic or shop contests, and not take a 
back seat either. He ought to be a 
subscriber to all student publications. 
In fact, his voice ought to be heard 
in student meetings, he should express 
his expert opinion in the student press. 
In short, he must enter with his whole 
heart into school activities, whether 
they be athletics, literary, dramatic, or 
social, if the Tech spirit is to keep 
pace with the physical growth of the 
Institution.
While I have purposely enlarged 
upon the part which the Faculty should 
play in developing a healthy school 
spirit, the fact remains that we must 
look to the student body and to the 
alumni for its real expression. The 
chief essential is a firmer loyalty to 
the School and all its departments. 
Tech spirit is too broad a thing to be 
hemmed in by class feeling or by a 
standard of professional aristocracy. 
Class rivalry and inter-school competi
tion, frequent mass meetings and so
cial functions, all aid in fostering the 
right sort of spirit. You cannot get 
together too often, as a mutual acquaintenceship is fundamental in 
stirring up enthusiasm. So get to
gether on the athletic field, meet on 
the side-lines; read your Tartan with 
at least as much interest as your text
book; contribute to it; subscribe and 
work enthusiastically for the Thistle; 
in short talk Tech wherever you go. 
Remember that Tech spirit is a matter 
of co-operation and not disintegra
tion.
Finally, if it were possible to per
sonify spirit of any kind, paradoxical 
as such a procedure may be, I would 
give body to Tech spirit by pointing 
out that young man or young woman, 
student or alumnus, or member of the 
faculty, whose interest and activity in 
all school affairs is actuated by a sin
cere application of the mottoMy 
Heart Is In the Work.

THE THISTLE.
The Thistle Board is still on the job. 
The photographs of the various class
es and clubs, will be taken this week. 
All Thistle material, such as the club 
and class write-ups, should be handed 
in to the board not later than Febru
ary 10th. All photographs must be 
purchased from the photographer, and 
turned over to the board before Febru
ary 10th in order to allow sufficient 
time for the making of engravings be
fore the book goes to press. The 
book this year will probably be bound 
in an Alhambra Leather cover, em
bossed with the school seal in gold. 
The receipts will be on sale for only 
a month more, consequently dont put 
off getting one for if you do you may 
wait until it is too late to get one.
NEW CLUB ROOM FOR INDUS
TRIES.
The question of getting a suitable 
club room for the School of Applied 
Industries has long been agitated. 
Several attempts have been made in 
the past but as yet nothing definite 
has been accomplished.
Last year a study room was furnish
ed, but owing to lack of room in the 
School it had to be vacated and used 
as an office. The furniture was taken 
to the old committee room1, which is 
now used as a study room.
The Student Senate finally started 
things again this year, with the pros
pect of furnishing the present room, 
and make it as much of a College Club 
Room as possible. At a mass meeting 
a committee was appointed to handle 
the affair and to look after the collect
ing of assessments. During the latter 
part of the week a thermometer, indi
cating the daily advancement of the 
fund, was on exhibition on the Bulle
tin Board.
It is the desire to make this cam
paign a success which will mean real 
chairs, benches, tables and a live 
piano. These, every one will admit, 
will make it a place where one can 
take any visitor he might be showing 
around, instead of keeping as far away 
as possible, which is now the case.
So it is up to every Industrial stu
dent to lend his support to make this 
new club room one of which to be 
proud.

CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING 
JAN. 26, 1914.
By a special effort, the Crucible 
Club held its second meeting of this 
year in room 209 Science'Building. The 
speaker of the evening was Mr. F. I. 
Gaston, 09, who held his audience to 
close attention by relating some of his 
personal experiences while pursuing 
his chosen profession. The evening 
came to a successful close with the 
consumption of the last crumb of

SOPH. CIVILS DEFEAT ELEC
TRICALS, 2115.
The opening intersection game of 
the Science Sophomores, played at the 
gym. on Tuesday evening, January 
20, at 5 P. M., resulted in the defeat 
of the Electricals by the Civils to the 
score of 2115. Through lack of
players, the Civils were forced to play 
Hines, a Varsity man; and his six field 
goals were too much for the Electric
als. After exams, a complete schedule 
for section teams will probably be ar
ranged. The line-up of Tuesdays 
game follows:

During the 38 years of its existence, 
the dental department of the Univer
sity of Michigan has sent into the 
world 1,600 successful dentists. There 
are several reasons which account for 
the fact. The dental department at 
Michigan possesses the finest and most 
complete dental museum in the world; 
it enjoys a clinic which is second to 
none in the United States; no Ameri
can school of dentistry has a better 
building, a higher standard of entrance 
and actual work. No American school 
has a better faculty at its head. Al
most all the dental work for the 6,000 
students of the university is done by 
the seniors of the dental school. More 
than $7,000 worth of gold was used last 
year by the dental department in its 
clinic. Michigans reputation in den
tistry is international. Michigan has 
more graduates from her dental de
partment practicing in Germany than 
any other American school; Michigan 
has more graduates in the British pos
sessions, with the exception of Aus
tralia than any other college of den
tistry. Michigans reputation in den
tistry is second to none.

SCIENCE SENIORS TO HAVE 
BIG PEANUT-BUST.
MHO CLUB MEETING.
Ah, those rascally Seniors! Theyre 
up to some more of their demoralizing 
deviltry. This time its to be a smok
er at the Schenley Hotel. This affair 
will be the crowning event of the 
social season, the committee admit it, 
and promises to be one hilarious jag 
of joy. And the cost is to be so rea
sonable! Not that these careless 
spendthrifts should worry, being for 
the most part vulgarly rich, but that 
they are so conservative . The date 
chosen for this colossal spread is Jan
uary 30, the Friday evening before 
exams., just by way of giving the 
profs, the once over and showing them 
how absolutely fearless are the noble 
Seniors in the race of impending dis
aster. As the scenario for this Saturnalian revel is, so to speak, in the 
shadow of the Bellfield Tabernacle, it 
is to be expected that a certain amount 
of religious atmosphere should creep 
into the proceedings and it is an
nounced that this smoker is to be dry. 
No booze will be allowed to come into 
the room and as an extra precaution, 
in case any should be taken in, sev
eral prominent members of the class 
have volunteered to see that none is 
allowed to get out. An interesting 
singing contest will take place that 
evening. In the ball room of the hotel 
Madame Schuman Heink will sing and 
in another part of the hotel many 
members of the Senior class will at
tempt to eclipse the performance of 
the famous singer.
Dutch Grotefend, that silver-tongued, 
golden-throated tenor, will add a 
touch of sentiment to the evenings '

Dartmouth Jack o Lantern.
The monthly meeting of the Mho 
Club was held Wednesday evening, 
January 21, at 8:30, in room 11, Mach
inery Hall.
Among the business proceedings 
were a resolution not to have a booth 
at the Junior Prom this year; and the 
appointment of a committee of three, 
L. R. Madison, R. E. Dunbar, and D. 
L. Trautman, to arrange for a Mho 
Club dinner, toward the end of the 
year. Madison also explained the ar
rangements for a Mechanical-Electric
al dance to be held in a laboratory in 
Machinery Hall on the night of Janu
ary 31. The assessment for this house
warming is seventy-five cents a couple, 
which includes light refreshments. 
Only sixty couples can be provided 
for, so the sale of tickets is limited.
The speakers of the evening were 
R. E. Dunbar and Claude Ettele. The 
former spoke of The Use of Elec
tricity in Mines, and he supplemented 
his talk with the projection upon the 
screen of cuts of electrical mining 
machinery, taken from catalogues. 
The latter speaker, Mr. Ettele, talking 
on The Use of Electricity on Ship
board, spoke from his personal ex
perience aboard a U. S. battleship; 
and he surely gave an entertaining and 
instructive exposition of the manifold 
uses of electricity aboard ships, and 
especially with regard to the big guns 
in action.
Professor Dennison, in his com
ments, said: It surely must make an 
electrical engineer feel good to realize 
how so many of mans activities depend 
upon him; and although there are a 
great many, there is still room for 
m'ore engineers.
The adjournment to the club room 
at the farther end of the upper corri
dor in Machinery Hall, for the eats, 
completed the program of the even
ing.
It is urgently requested that the 
Seniors turn out in full force for the 
next meeting which will take place on 
February 25th. The reason for this 
appeal is made more obvious when it 
is known that election of second sem
ester officers will be held at this time. 
Seniors, assert your rights!
NEW POWER UNIT FOR ME
CHANICAL DEPARTMENT.
A new seventy-five kilowatt Westinghouse steam turbine has been re
ceived by the mechanical department. 
Work of installing is proceeding rap
idly, so that the machine will soon be 
ready for use in connection with the 
present generator in case of break
down. The turbine is arranged to op
erate with or without condensers, thus 
making a valuable addition to the de
partment for experimental purposes.
Remember, no flowers at the Prom 
this year. Another reason for going.

ELECTRO-MECHANICAL 
DANCE.
The dance given by the combined 
Electrical and Mechanical Engineer
ing Societies, in honor of the comple
tion of Machinery Hall, will be held 
in the Hall on Saturday evening, Jan
uary 31st. TSe dancing will begin at 
eight oclock, rack dances being danced 
until eight-thirty, at which time the 
dance orders will be given out. This 
will ensure those coming late being 
able to get their dance orders filled 
out. The dance will be open to the 
members of all the engineering socie
ties, and their friends. Dean Leete 
has very kindly turned over the Fac
ulty Club Room to the students for 
the evening which will permit those 
not wishing to dance to play cards or 
pool. As other dances will probably 
be held every second week in the fu
ture if this dance is well supported, 
every member of the school should 
make it a point to honor the occasion 
with his presence, which besides mak
ing the dance a success will furnish 
a lot of relaxation before the awful 
pestilence of final exams strikes the 
school next week, Monday.

delightful comedy, The Rejuvenation

rejoice to learn that Mr. Harry Davis 
has secured the exclusive rights for 
its production in stock and that it 
will be the offering of the Harry 
Davis players at the Duquesne begin
ning with matinee Monday, February
2, and continuing twice daily through 
the week. The play, replete with hu
mor and pathos, was dramatized from 
the authors story of like name.
Advance seats are now on sale at 
the Box Office of the Duquesne.

Peg o My Heart proved conclu
sively when here earlier in the season 
that Pittsburgh can still laugh heartily

coarse, and that simple story, directly 
and simply told, is more potent than 
any plot fantastic, complex or merely 
outre.
It costs you big, large dollars to

A new lamp, known as the Wotan
1 1-2 watt lamp, designed for high effi
ciency on large candle power, is be
ing introduced into the electrical 
world. As the name indicates, this 
lamp consumes one half watt per 
candle power and sizes varying from 
600 to 3,000 candle power capacity 
are being manufactured. This lamp 
is designed to replace the troublesome 
arc lights for street illuminations, etc. 
They have several advantages over 
the latter. There are no mechanical 
parts to get out of order and the 
trimming and replacing of carbons 
are eliminated. The filaments are 
formed of a very closely coiled spiral 
of drawn wire, and this instead of 
being arranged in vertical stripes is 
looped to supports in such a manner 
that practically its entire length is in 
the horizontal plane, an arrangement 
which is said to give an actual down
ward candle-power equivalent to 80 
per cent of the total candle-power of 
the lamp. The whole of the illumi
nating structure is* suspended on the 
leading-in wires, and the lamps can 
thus be used in positions subjected to 
vibration.The Tech.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May wre depend upon YOU to take this as a re
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.Any that were originally

MILLIONS AT FOOTBALL 
GAMES.
Approximately 150,000 Players Par
ticipated in Contests During the 
SeasonParke Davis Compiles In
teresting Statistics.
New York, Jan. 21.Figures show
ing the widespread popularity of in
tercollegiate football during the sea
son of 1913 have been compiled by 
Parke Davis, Princetons member of 
the Rules Committee. According to 
his estimates 400 colleges and 5000 
schools throughout the country were 
represented by elevens last autumn. 
Approximately 43,200 games were 
played and 150,000 players participated 
in the contests and practice. Placing 
the average attendance at these games 
as lowr as 300 the total attendance 
would not be far from 13,000,000.
The longest goal from the field was 
a place kick of 52 yards scored by 
Carl Woodward of Tulane University 
against St. Louis University. The 
second longest goal was also a place 
kick, 49 yards, achieved by J. J. Dunn 
of Baltimore City College against Gil
man School. The honor of the long
est drop kick scoring a goal goes to 
a schoolboy, James M. Porter of Mc
Kenzie School, who in a game against 
Hackley School, sent the ball spinning 
over the bar 45 yards distant. The 
longest goal from a drop kick by a 
college player in 1913 was the 42-yard 
goal of H. A. Baker of Princeton 
against Yale. Separated from Baker 
by a single yard are R. M. Galvin of 
Pittsburgh, who sent a drop krck from

the 42-mark through Carlisles goal 
posts, and H. P. Tallman of Rutgers, 
who duplicated the feat against Trin
ity. Two other place kicks entitled to 
mention were a 45-yard goal achieved 
by Ronald Kinney of Trinity against 
New York University and a 46-yard 
goal by H. A. H. Baker of Princeton 
against Holy Cross.
The record for the greatest number 
of field goals by a single player in one 
game goes to Charles E. Brickley of 
Harvard, who scored five against Yale. 
Pressing him' closely, however, is the 
schoolboy performer, James M. Por
ter, who, in the game against Hackley 
referred to, kicked three other goals 
from the field, all by drop kicks, mak
ing four for the day, with the addition
al distinction of having missed a fifth 
try from the 50-yard line by only a 
narrow margin.
One of the surprising features of 
1913 was the frequency of long runs 
from kick-offs. Hitherto they have 
been so rare that seldom more than 
one has appeared throughout a season.
