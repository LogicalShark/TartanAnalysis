M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. When he 
first entered the industrial field, Dr. 
Warner was a research chemist with 
Barret Company, the Cosden Oil

joined the Carnegie Tech faculty 
in 1926, becoming an Assistant Pro
fessor of Chemistry in 1928, Associ

Metallurgy in 1936, and Professor 
and Head *of the Department of 
Chemistry in 1938.
Dr. Warner is active in the affairs 
of various professional societies. He 
serves as a councilor of the Amer
ican Chemical Society and was 
Chairman of the Pittsburgh Sec

Samuel Rosenberg Awarded First 
Honorable Mention in U. S. Exhibit
Samuel Rosenberg, famous Pitts
burgh artist and professor in the 
Painting and Design Department of 
Carnegie Tech, has again distin
guished himself through his work.
In the current Exhibit of Painting 
in the United States, which opened 
Thursday evening, October 11, at 
the Carnegie Museum, his rich and 
expressive oil painting, Israel, was 
awarded first honorable mention.
The exhibit, an annual affair, is 
a presentation of paintings by well 
known American artists who are in
vited to submit their work. The pur
pose of the show is to acquaint the 
public with the artists and the vari
ous types of painting predominant 
today. It is taking the place of the 
famed International Exhibit which 
has been discontinued since the war.

Eleanor Squitieri 
Represents C.I.T.
Eleanor Squitieri, a junior in 
the Department of Chemistry, has 
been selected as student representa
tive of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology to attend the New York 
Herald Tribune Forum to be held at 
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New 
York City, October 29-31. Miss 
Squitieri and representatives from
other Eastern colleges will compose 
the audience which will observe and 
ask questions on a discussion con
ducted by nationally prominent 
leaders in government and industry 
on the subject, Responsibility of 
Victory.
Miss Squitieri was chosen by the 
vote of a committee of faculty mem
bers who teach Social Relations. Of 
particular significance in the choice 
was the fact that Miss Squitieri had 
previously been awarded a prize for 
her essay on civic problems in the 
students home community.
The Forum will also be attended 
by two other representatives of Car
negie Tech. John L. Elliott, Execu

and administration, and Frederick 
C. Mostellier, 1938, will represent 
the alumni.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1945
Cditosi'l /'uKcUcUn.Student Council Minutes
Carnegie Needs You
Ever since they realized that Carnegies student enrollment was ap
proaching pre-war levels, the people on campus have been demanding that 
we return to a full peacetime schedule of campus activities, but only a few 
of us have been doing anything about it. The members of Student Council 
have all been doing an excellent job of reconverting Tech to peace. Even 
before school opened this year, they were at work on the Freshman Regula
tions program and had already set up a tentative schedule of social events 
for the coming year. Last Saturday, they demonstrated their ability to 
carry their plans into effect by giving the best mixer dance that Carnegie 
has seen in many a year. Members of the Council along with a few other 
interested students are working to reestablish such honoraries as ODK, 
Delta Skull and Scimitar and to set up a Points and Keys system under 
which important positions on campus will be divided fairly and appre
ciation for service to the school will be shown. They are now putting a 
great deal of effort into making the coming all-school Council dance a 
success. Other organizations as well are struggling to make this year a 
wonderful one. Womens Guild has plans under way to give their tradi
tional all-school dance once again. The Mens Glee Club has made ambi
tious plans for the future, and Citcom shows definite signs of becoming the 
force it once was on campus. The International Relations Club is expand
ing; Intramural Board has set up an attractive sports program for the year 
and the new Scottie Staff is going to give you a really good magazine once 
more. At first glance it would seem that everyone on campus is involved 
in the reconversion movement, but in actuality, all the work is being 
done by a very limited number of people. Those people need help from you.
There are ways in which you can help almost every one of these 
groups to give the campus a fuller life and meaning. The Scottie needs your 
help in writing features that will present a truly humorous picture of 
campus life. IRC wants to hear your point of view on world affairs. Citcom 
would like to have you go along and have fun at their get-togethers. All 
these organizations need members from among you to stimulate their 
groups and to help them carry out their plans. Womens Guild is an organ
ization made up of representatives sent from every campus activity in 
which women participate and is therefore in a sense the representative 
body of all the women on campus. Guild is planning big things this year, 
but it is handicapped by the fact that a large number of its members 
are not interested enough in the organization to attend its meetings. Its 
up to you to see that the activities to which you belong send representa
tives to Guild who will take an active part in its work. Everyone com
plained about the lack of athletic activity on campus last year and now 
that the coaches and Intramural Board have attempted to set up a more 
active sports program, it is up to the men to go out and play.
Student Council particularly needs your support. Even though the 
majority of you cannot belong to the body, there are at least three ways 
in which you can help its members to create real college spirit. In the first 
place, you can cooperate more fully with the Freshman Regulations Pro
gram. There have certainly been a great many more violations of the rules 
set down by Council than have been reported. The TS cards can be found 
at any time in the Beanery, so get yours and report that Frosh. Secondly, 
you can get behind the Student Council all-school dance which is sched
uled for the first weekend in November. Buy a ticket and drag a gal, or 
enveigle a man to buy a ticket and drag you. The third and most important 
thing that you can do for Council is to attend their meetings. The members 
of the organization are trying their best to set up rules and regulations 
which will govern campus affairs wisely and well both now and in the 
future. They are trying to plan a social calendar which will give you what 
you want in the way of enjoyment during the coming year. They want 
your opinions and they need your suggestions in order that they may 
function as a body truly representative of the Carnegie Tech Students. 
Council meetings are held every Sunday night at seven oclock in the 
Conference room of the Carnegie Union. They are open to everyone. At 
Carnegie, you dont have to write to your representative; you can tell him 
what to do, so go up next Sunday night and give Council the benefit of a 
few of your pearls of wisdom.
Remember that you actually will get more out of working for these 
organizations than you can ever give them. Youll have fun and youll 
learn a lot about people and about business. Youre missing at least fifty 
percent of college life if you dont go out for a few activities and take part 
in Carnegies reconversion.

WO years before Pearl Harbor the Govern

help perfect radar as a military instrument. The 
Bell System, through the Western Electric Com

Bell scientists designed and developed many 
different types of radars  each for a specific job.
One particular type was standard for B-29s in 
the Pacific for navigation, target location and 
high altitude bombing. Another directed all Navy

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1946SPORTS 
Intramural football got off to a 
rousing start this week on the cut 
with the weather perfect and the 
games providing thrilling spectacles 
for the non-paying customers. 
Monday . . .
The Delts took over the Phi Kaps 
on the field No. 1 to the tune of 12- 
1the Phi Kaps mustering their 
lone tally in the last quarter on a 
pass from Red Voptic to Benya. 
The DTD scoring combo was Har
low to Christenson on a long aerial. 
Meanwhile the Betas trounced the 
PiKAs in a hard-fought, close battle 
on the center field. The final score 
Betas 14, PiKAs 8.
The SAEs and TXs played to a 
draw on field No. 3 with the TXs 
coming from behind to tie the score 
at 7-7. Theta Xis touchdown ma
terialized from a long wing to Umbach with Chuck Sutton on the toss
ing end. The SAEs tally was a pass 
pulled down by McNeal.
Tuesday . . .
Scobell Hall displayed terrific 
power and a smooth passing attack 
to defeat the Independents, 32-7. 
Little Red Masts boys seem slated 
for a great future at this point. The 
DUs walked over the PiKAs to the 
tune of 7-0 with Don Dunbar cross
ing the double stripe on an intercep
tion.
Meanwhile the Delts massacred a 
disorganized TX team by a score of 
37-3. They seemed to be able to 
score at random and did so at con
venient intervals during the game.
Wednesday . . .
The Betas came through on field 
No. 1 to maintain their undefeated 
record by taking the Independents 
by a score of 7-1 in a hard-fought 
contest.
Scobell Hall again displayed their 
power as the SAEs succumbed 14-2.
The Phi Kaps came out on the 
long end of a 15-11 battle with the 
Theta Xis. In the last 30 seconds of 
play there was a disputed T. X. 
touchdown when Umbach ran 35 
yards on a fumbled Phi Kap later
al. The decision was given to Theta 
Xi, but the final score still showed 
Phi Kap ahead15-11.
Thursday . . .
The DUs downed the Indepen
dents by a score of 7-2 on field No. 1. 
The highlights of this game were 
two marvelous goal-line stands by 
the DUs in the latter part of the 
fourth quarter.
The feature of this week was 
played between the Delts and Sco
bell Hall. Both teams had previous
ly displayed terrific running and 
passing attacks and it is very likely 
that the boys from Scobell Hall who 
defeated the Delts by a score of 17- 
12 will go undefeated. The Delts 
pulled the famous sleeper play in 
the opening minutes to chalk up a 
5-0 margin. At the end of a fast first 
quarter the score was 6-5 with DTD 
still in front. In the second quar
ter the Delts went wild and rolled 
to another touchdown and first 
down to make the score at the half, 
Delts12, Scobell5.
Scobell then staged a brilliant 
second half comeback as they cross
ed the goal twice and added a couple 
of extra points on first-downs to 
give them the victory.
The tying boys of SAE did it 
again when they evened the score 
with the Betas at 5-5. The Beta 
touchdown was made in the second 
quarter when Whitmoyer crossed 
the goal on a punt-run-back. The 
S.A.E.s made good their chance to 
score in the last quarter when they 
recovered a bad center to put them 
in position for Matthews to carry 
the ball over on an end run.

Wrestling
It has been brought to the atten
tion of this writer that only ten men 
have reported for wrestling prac
tice. This is a deplorable situation. 
Cmon men! Lets not let the Alma 
Mater down. With student enroll
ment at peacetime levels there 
should be at least 50 men out for 
wrestling. Why not take advantage 
of the teachings of Coach Alexan
der, and at the same time benefit 
yourself. If enough men report for 
practice,' there will be intramural 
competition in wrestling but only 
those who have received this train
ing will be allowed to participate. 
So come one, come all, but be sure 
to come to the Gymnasium on Mon
day, Wednesday, or Thursday after
noons at five oclock and report to 
Coach Alexander.
Red Cross Recruits 
For Educational Unit
The Pittsburgh Chapter of the 
American Red Cross is now recruit
ing educators and teachers for a 
newly formed Educational Unit 
which is under the jurisdiction of 
the Chairman of Volunteer Special 
Services. The newly appointed 
chairman of the unit is Dr. R. T. 
Hughes, educator and author.
During the past few months 
wounded veterans in hospitals 
throughout the country have shown 
an ever increasing interest in 
furthering their education. Some of 
the men are taking correspondence 
courses under the supervision of 
the United States Armed Forces In
stitute with a view to completing 
their high school or college educa
tions. In order that these men do 
not become discouraged by a par
ticularly difficult lesson, it has been 
suggested that the presence and

Madame Suzy, Milliner, 
Visits Carnegie Tech
Madame Suzy, famed French mil
linery artist, visited Carnegie Tech 
on Tuesday, October 16th. Since last 
August when she left her Salon on 
the Rue de la Paix, she has been 
making a good-will tour of the Unit
ed States.
Before a group of students and 
faculty members, the world-reknowned creator of hats exhibited 
the skill and imagination which has 
made her famous. A high crowned 
turban of red silk jersey with a side 
drape, which she demonstrated and 
presented to one of the students, 
has left a never to be forgotten im
pression on the millinery minded 
set on campus.
This dynamic little lady has been 
designing hats for the past twentythree years.
Students Reorganize Mens Glee Club; 
Newly Elected Officers Plan Concerts
Since its first meeting less than 
two weeks ago, the revived edition 
of the Carnegie Tech Mens Glee 
Club has completed its organization, 
elected its officers, and held its first 
rehearsals. Marking still another 
step toward complete reconversion 
on the Tech campus, the Club has 
gotten off to a particularly fine start. 
Paul Brautiga, a C.I.T. alumnus 
and present conductor of choral mu
sic at Schenley High, is back as Sen
ior Director, and is ably assisted by. 
Robert Skinkle as Student Director.
Early indications show that the 
club is particularly well-balanced, 
and prospects for concerts in the im
mediate future look fine. The club 
has been booming up on all the old 
favorites and the Tech songs.
Rehearsals are being held every
Wednesday and Friday at 5:00 in 
room 103 Margaret Morrison. There 
is still plenty of room for additional 
singers, so anyone interested is in
vited to attend the rehearsals.
The new officers are:
Robert Skinkle  Student Direc
tor.
H. ThorManager.
Richard TellerTreasurer.
Robert SinclairLibrarian.
Robert Teasdale  Assistant Li
brarian.

Freshmen Appear 
At Council Court
On Thursday, October 18th, at 
5:00, the Freshman Regulations and 
Orientation Committee tried the 
first violators of freshman reg
ulations. The members of the court 
were Pinky Clark, John Seiple, Bob 
Skinkle, Mary Lou Ashe, Pat Baum, 
Phoebe James, and Esther Haushalter.
The frosh who were tried were 
Nadine Henry, Francis Clark, Shir
ley Christjohn, Vincent Benya, Wal
ter Stelley, Joanne Barr, and Paul
ine Specht. Andrew Cambol and R. 
A. Plender were summoned but 
failed to appear. For the most part 
the violation was failure to wear 
dink or tie. Punishment was meted 
out in accordance with the number 
and nature of offenses and the at
titude of the offender. Since this was 
the first meeting of the court and 
the first time the frosh had a chance 
to defend themselves, leniency was 
shown in cases where there was 
only one offense. Nadine Henry, 
Francis Clark, Shirley Christjohn, 
Joanne Barr, and Pauline Specht 
were given warnings. In addition 
Mr. Clark has to report to Augie 
Binder every day for a week wear
ing his tie and dink, and Miss 
Christjohn has to report to Pink 
Clark at every assembly wearing 
her hat. Mr. Benya got a 10% in
crease in the grade he must have in 
order to pass the traditions exam, 
and his name was put down for Fun 
Night. Mr. Stelleys case was re
ferred dirertly to Student Council 
The court adjourned at 6:00.

Student Service Fund 
Starts Autumn Drive
During the German occupation, 
university life in France was ren
dered nearly impossible because 
curriculum and professors were 
strictly regulated. The Vichy gov
ernment called up a large propor
tion of the student population for 
deportation to Germany, but many 
managed to escape and join the Free 
French. Others did forced labor in 
German work camps or received 
prison sentences. As a result of such 
hardships and the severe food short
age, most students today are run
down in health and many suffer 
from TB.
These students are so ill that 
further schooling at the present 
time is impossible. However many 
have been given a chance to recov
er by staying at a rest chalet in 
the French mountains.
A social and cultural program has 
been started. It includes a music 
group which gives weekly pro
grams, a choir, and a photography 
club. In addition, study groups dis
cuss political issues and the prob
lems to be faced in reforming uni
versity life. This work is made pos
sible in part by the contributions of 
American students to the World 
Student Service Fund drives on 
campus.

Evening Student Council 
Calls Assembly For Nov. 3
Plans are underway for the party 
originally scheduled to be held Oc
tober 27. Difficulties are being en
countered, however, which prevent 
the publication of the place at this 
time. Suitable places are as scare as 
the proverbial hens teeth. The date 
has been tentatively set for Novem
ber 3.
At this party it is planned to pre
sent the revised constitution which 
the committee has been working 
upon for some time. Representatives 
for the various sections and depart
ments are to be selected to serve 
during the present transition year.
It is expected that this party will 
be well attended and refreshments 
are to be furnished for those pres
ent.
See First Play of Season
Drama lovers of Evening School, 
take heed and march up to Mr. McKelay in the Registrars Office to get 
your tickets which can be obtained 
free of charge by presenting your 
registration card. For their first pre
sentation the Drama Department of 
the College of Fine Arts is offering 
The Romantic Young Lady at the 
Little Theatre located in the Fine 
Arts building.
The performances in the past have 
been very fine and we can guaran
tee that this play will continue to 
uphold the usual high standards of 
the drama students.
You have between October 27th 
and November 3rd to see this play, 
which begins at 8:30 each evening. 
Lets get our tickets early!
CditoA'i, Noi&&
There are approximately 70 vet
erans in the Evening School taking 
courses in Engineering and Fine 
Arts. There is no program set up for 
the G. I.s, but the regular courses 
are offered through the Bill of 
Rights. Any serviceman who was 
under 25 years of age at the time of 
his induction and has been in the 
service more than 90 days, is en
titled to a years training, plus ad
ditional time for every month in the 
service. Thus if a man has been in 
the Armed Forces for three years, 
he will receive four years educa
tion. However this time is doubled 
in Evening School because the 
courses are part-time. A man, over 
25 when inducted and attending 
night school at that time, is entitled 
to one years training if he can 
prove his education was interrupt
ed.
We would like to see more vet
erans enrolled in courses which are 
offered at Carnegie Tech in the 
Evening School. Perhaps you know 
an ex-G.I. who would like to 
further his education, but has not 
realized that Evening School offers 
the same opportunity as the Day 
School. Talk to him and maybe he, 
too, will come to Carnegie.
What a scene greets the eye at the 
new Plaid Office  girls and more 
girls. Above the din can be heard 
the infectious laughter of Ruthie 
McGraw as she skips about in her 
new role as editor. In the far corner 
one sees smiling Arlene deep in her 
work drawing up her next weeks 
article. The big smoke stack of Ches 
Biscup is generating a thick im
penetrable fog which hovers over 
all like the smog of East Pittsburgh. 
Even Ed McDonald is working away 
on the typewriter like the trouper 
he is. Have come to the conclusion, 
after much wasted deliberation, that 
a good highball is needed to produce 
a better eight ball.
Scouting out around the airport 
last summer whom should we see in 
flying togs but Jean Albright ready 
to step into her little trainer ( and 
we mean a plane). The next that we 
heard was that she received her de
gree in higher artsa private pilots 
license. At least thats one way of 
keeping ones head above the clouds 
eh, Jeannie? We girls hear rumors 
that there are now more men on the 
campus. Wonder where they are 
hiding?
Typical Evening Student
We look in on our Typical Eve
ning School Student for this even
ing, dashing across the cut with only 
two minutes to reach his class. Upon 
reaching his destination, breathing 
quite heavily after his 100 yard 
dash, our student finds, much to his 
despair, that the instructor had al
ready begun class. Trying to make 
the least pratical noise, our wonder 
man proceeds on his mad hunt for 
that invisible vacant seat. After 
playing Leap Frog over a dozen 
out-stretched feet, he finally reaches 
his well-earned place. Having post
poned his assignment all week long, 
our brave man now fully realizes he 
has come to class unprepared for 
the evenings lesson. Taking little in
terest in what is being said, he soon 
finds himself being in dreamland, 
for getting little sleep during the 
past few nights, it was quite dif
ficult to keep his eyes opened. It 
seems like no time at all has elapsed 
to our superman, when he is 
awakened gently by the person sit
ting next to him following the 
Good Neighbor Policy. The bell 
having rung and class dismissed, our 
Typical Evening School Student 
goes on his merry way.
Memoirs of a Lonely Sailor
The Evening Student Council re
ceived an interesting letter during 
the past week from a former student 
who is now serving in the U. S. Nav
al Separation Center in New York 
City. He wrote:
It has been quite some time since 
I last dropped you all (Southern 
accent) a line, but this young man 
has been quite busy up until my ar
rival in New York City two weeks 
ago today.
My last letter was written while 
I was in Sampson, New York, and 
since that time I have done some 
traveling. After completing my boot 
training I shipped to Gulfport, Miss., 
to Radio-operating. The trip requir
ed 36 hours to make it to the sunny 
south not counting the six hour 
layover in Buffalo which later prov
ed a breather for me and my pals.
To me, Gulfport is a good place to 
stay away from, but they didnt 
consult me so there I was with a ra
dio course which was driving me 
nuts when suddenly it was drop
ped and we were given a choice of 
several cities for our next base. To
ledo, Ohio, seemed a likely place for 
me, and I was about signed up when 
my second or hind thought prompt
ed me to take New York City. So 
here I am.
The trip north was very pleasant 
for me as I knew that I was getting 
back to my territory and this was 
some thing for me. Layovers at At
lanta and Washington, D. C., afford

also to partake of some pleasant reThe Carnegie Plaid

New York and took a dash home to 
seek the folks. Since it was over the 
weekend I was unable to stop in to 
see the old gang of Council and the 
Plaid. I hope, though, that it wont 
be long before I am able to pay a 
visit to the campus. This brings me 
to the most important part of my 
letter. My folks told me when I was 
home that I had -been awarded an 
Evening Student Council Key. I was 
deeply moved to say that I hope to 
be back to earn another one. So 
dont be surprised if you see me in 
the doorway real soon.
