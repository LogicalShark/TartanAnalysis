Tech Victorious 25-7 
At W & J Homecoming
Carnegie Tech has come up with a potent attack in its 
last two outings and the results have been a 27-6 Homecoming 
victory over Grove City and a 25-7 triumph over Washington 
and Jefferson at the Jays Homecoming. This leaves the Tar
tans undefeated after five games,?----------------------------------------------------
but facing the three toughest 
games on their schedule.
The sudden effectiveness of the
offense is mainly due to the long 
aerials from Muth to ends Larry 
Arendas and Marty Poad and to 
wingback Pete Wilson. The pass
ing attack has also opened up the 
opponents defense for the run
ning of Wilson, John Zinni and 
Court Burrell.
Early Score
Tech struck early in its match 
against Grove City, setting up the 
score with a long throw to 
Arendas and following with its 
favorite, Muth to Poad to Zinni 
pass around left end. The next 
score came on a 90-yard march 
climaxed by Muths three yard 
sneak. In the third quarter Wil
son ran a punt back to the three 
and scored on the next play with 
a reverse, the closest man to him 
being the quarterback who handed 
him the ball.
The scoring was completed 
when the second team marched 
about 60 yards in the closing min
utes. Most of the yardage came 
"from end sweeps by Furman 
Smith and Court Burrell, the lat
ter scoring from four yards out. 
Pete Schlegel added three con
versions in four attempts and the 
game ended with everyone seeing 
action.
Soggy Field
The field at W&J was soggy at 
the start and rain threatened, so 
Tech quickly took to the air for 
three scores in the first half. The
runs by Wilson and Zinni. Pete 
Schlegel easily added the point 
but thereafter Carnegie elected to 
try for two points after by running 
or throwing.
Tech got a fifty yard march un
der way in the second quarter us
ing passes to Poad and Arendas 
and finishing with an end sweep 
by Zinni. The Tartans came right 
back with a recovered fumble and 
two short passes to Poad.
Second Team
The second team took over in 
the second half, and though they 
threatened twice, they were not 
able to come up with a score. 
Techs last six points came on a 
fine 50-yard punt return by Bur
rell.
r Too much credit cannot be giv
en to the men up front who are 
making the offense click or to the 
stout defense which has now lim
ited the opposition \o 26 points in 
five games.
Carnegie now has the opportu
nity to finish the season without 
a loss, though their real tests are 
coming up. This weeks opponent, 
Geneva, gave notice of their in
tentions by whipping Slippery 
Rock 28-6, while Tech barely 
managed a 7-0 victory over the 
common foe. Also interesting to 
note was the 20-0 victory over 
Grove City by Westminster. How
ever, the Tartans have continued 
to improve and become better bal
anced. Each victory has added 
momentum to their cause, and
first came on the seventh play of they will not likely forget last 
the game when Muth hit Wilson i years humiliation at the hands of 
in the end zone following two long i Geneva.
4 Why Spring Carnival?' Debated 
In Student Congress Meeting
The Student Congress meeting of October 21 progressed 
from a formal meeting to one of lively discussion.
After the roll call and reading of the minutes, Mike Bass, 
co-chairman of the Homecoming Committee, gave a report
on Homecoming. Aside from re-^----------------------------------------
ceiving the necessary cooperation ,, (alks Qn (h na(ure 
in planning the events, Mike also
reported a large financial profit ; iesPec,lve committees the names 
for the weekend. The committee freshmen who had volunteered 
spent $1,100 and received $3,200 to act as freshmen apprentices on 
in returns reflecting a large turnj the committees, 
out at the Homecoming Dance. Chairman Jan Chaiken then 
The proceeds of Homecoming are , turned the interest of Congress to to be transferred to the Spring
Carnival budget in the hopes of 
obtaining top-notch entertainment 
for this coming spring weekend.
Jim Sharkey of the finance com
mittee gave a short report on the 
aims of his committee. He an
nounced that the budgets of vari
ous campus publications are soon 
to be examined.
Leadership Committee
A report on the Leadership 
Committee was given by Ed Blum, 
co-chairman. Ed commented on 
the success of the recent Fresh
men Leadership Conference. He 
thanked the committee chairmen 
for their cooperation in giving
a more lively topic. Triggered by 
a recent queryWhy Spring 
Carnival?in the October 14 is
sue of the Tartan, a lively discus
sion of this subject took place. 
Many questions were raised in the 
minds of Congress members. 
Should Spring Carnival be dis
pensed with entirely or merely be 
more restricted as to time and 
money spent? These and many 
other questions have yet to be 
answered. Since the issue is im
portant to everyone, opinions are 
being solicited by Congress repre
sentatives. Through your repre
sentative you can voice your opin
ion about this matter.

To The Men Students W ho 
Will Eat At Moreivood:
With Skibos demolition a definite thing, and the plans 
for food service at Morewood for 400 undergraduate men an 
equally definite plan, many questions have been raised by both 
Morewood residents and prospective Morewood diners about 
standard rules and changes in procedures in the Morewood dining 
room. This article is an attempt to answer these questions and per
haps ward off some problems before they begin.
The most frequent question heard from the men concerns actual 
procedure in the dining room. All that is necessary to remember 
here is that, since Morewood girls have to carry their trays and empty 
dashes back to the kitchen window when theyve finished a meal, it 
is requested that the men do this also. Dinner is made a little more 
formal in that the girls are requested to take dishes off the trays and 
nlv use the trays to carry empty dishes back. This rule, used by 
the men, could easily make dinner time more homelike and desirable 
to them, having been used to the clamor, informality, and drabness 
of Skibo. Despite the inconvenience of a longer walk, it is assured 
that, if these simple rules are followed, Morewood dining will be
much more enjoyable than Skibo dining ever was.
Since Morewood is the home, nine months out of the year, of 
nearly 500 girls and only temporarily a school food service facility, 
Morewood residents would prefer that undergraduate men use only 
the dining room entrance at the foot of the stairs just before the 
circle to enter and leave the dining room. Morewood girls would 
also prefer that men not use the lobby on the first floor unless ac
companied by a date.
Morewood girls have been asked to use the upstairs room for 
hanging coats to give more room for the men in the downstairs rack
facilities located just inside the dining room entrance.
These simple rules, if followed by all will insure the pleasant 
dining atmosphere in Morewood Gardens and help eliminate many 
problems before they begin. Jan Notopoulos

Skibo Closing 
November 2
With the closing of the cafeig^ria facilities at Skibo, it will be 
necessary for evening students 
who had meals at Skibo before 
attending classes to find other fa
cilities off campus. The cafeteria 
services available at other points, 
such as Morewood Gardens are 
mainly for the convenience of 
resident students and they are in
adequate to serve commuting or 
earning students. It will therefore 
be necessary for evening students 
to obtain their meals elsewhere 
before attending classes, effective 
November 2.
Student Council 
Business Meeting
Evening Student Council will 
tartd their regular monthly busi
ness meeting at Carnegie Union 
on November 1, at 2 p.m. Any 
students interested in working 
with Council or observing their 
activities are welcome to attend 
the meeting. All evening school 
Organizations should have at least 
one active member on Council to 
assure representation of the in
terests of their group. If your or
ganization is not represented oni
uncil, it is suggested that an 
jointment be made of a mem
ber to attend Council functions.

Over the years the various com
mittees of the association have 
conducted numerous studies for 
the members furnishing data for 
the improvement of instruction, 
teacher selection and training, 
curriculum building, administra
tive procedures, services to the 
community, and the promotion of

Literature And the Arts
Glimpses
At two-thirty in the morning, a young man drives into 
the park. He has no one in his car, dammit, and he drives, 
ttlf hoping to find the park empty, half wanting it to be fill
ed. If there are people parked, his thinking way back in his 
mind wants them to spring out of their cars and have a big 
wine drinking party together on the lawn.
At two-thirty in the morning the park is empty and he 
drives till he comes to the reservoir where he parks his car. 
He lights a cigarette which is the time limit he gives himsplf.
If love or inspiration dont come^----------------------------------------?------L~
floating out of the water in the
time it takes him to smoke the 
^garette hell call it a night and 
go back to the job of pursuing 
them.
The water is striped with the, 
reflection of the sidewalk lamps 
surrounding it; the moon is too 
bright to allow too many of the 
stars to be seen, so the night is as 
unalone as a young-mari-standingin-front-of-a-reservoir-in-an - un
peopled-park can be. 
jiThe cigarette burns down and 
W throws it into the water, after 
only a moments hesitation over 
dirtying the drinking water.
The miracle didnt happen to 
him this night, but he realizes that 
the evening isnt ideal, which 
gives him an excuse to try again 
another night. And at a little after
two-thirty of a day in which love 
or inspiration didnt occur, he 
feels a bit forlorn.
Wolf Lowenthal
The Ideal
Heclutched it tightly in cold 
sweaty palms.
Held it to his breast. Face.
Caressed it with heated lips.
He would stain with it his body, 
color the flesh its indelible 
pigment.
So he ran jubilant amongst them, 
shouting. Look! Look! I 
have it ! !
But it slipped from his grasp, 
onto the cold streets.
And they trampled it to nothing
ness.

Selecting Candidates
Scabbard and Blade, the national ROTC military honor
ary, is once again considering possible candidates for mem
bership. Invitations have been extended to members of the 
ROTC advanced corps to appear for interviews in anticipa----------------------------------------------------?tion of joining the select group.
Membership is by invitation only,Same Uniforms 
For All Cadets
Each Thursday the wearin o 
th green, Army green, becomes 
prominent on campus. This year, 
for the first time, both the basic 
and advanced corps ROTC cadets 
are authorized to wear the stand
ard Army green uniform. Last 
w^ek the regiment integrated its 
full complement of freshmen into 
the ranks.
To many outsiders, members 
of the various classes, might seem 
indistinguishable from one an
other, now that the basic corps 
cadets wear green as the ad
vanced corps cadets have done for 
the past two years. However, 
closer scrutiny will reveal differ
ences in apparel. The basic corps 
uniform for freshmen and sopho
mores is similar to the serge uni
form worn by regular Army non
commissioned officers.
Distinguishing Features
The advanced corps uniforms 
are tailor-made for the individual 
from elastic material. An imme
diate distinguishing feature be
tween the advanced corps and 
basic corps uniforms is the hat 
brass. Advanced corps cadet of
ficers and non-commissioned of
ficers wear the United States eagle 
surmounted by an ROTC banner. 
The basic corps cadets hat brass 
is the customary semi-circular 
wreath and ROTC banner. Cadet 
commissioned officers are further 
distinguished in the advanced 
corps by their silver chin-strap 
above the cap visor. In addition, 
all advanced corps cadets wear 
lapel brass signifying member
ship in their particular Army 
service branch, Engineer or Signal 
Corps.

IM Football Season Ends This 
Week; Playoffs Are Next Week
A big week looms aKead for I. M. Football squads as league championship games come 
up. Last weeks action eliminated three major contenders and gave six teams a berth in the 
playoffs.
Both Delta Tau Delta and SAE Purple fought their way into the playoffs by elim
inating PKA. The Delt-PKA game which finally went into overtime, saw the lead change 
hands a half dozen times in the fourth quarter alone. The Delts won the 32-27 contest on a 
touchdown pass to Jim Linduff. Bill Hall, PK A quarterback, got little cooperation from his 
ends when he needed it, but still was the best player on the field.
Leading at half time 8-7, the ?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PKA offense again folded against
SAE Purple. Both teams played 
poor ball but the SAE defense 
tightened in the second half and 
went on to a 16-11 victory. Bob . 
Reber claimed SAEs touchdowns.
Elsewhere, in the battle for the 
basement, Obelisk beat Tau Delta 
Phi, 25-9, for their first victory.
Bears
Phi Kappa Theta folded out of 
Bear League contention by losing 
to KS and SN. Kappa Sig. who 
has been a sleeper all year, finally 
came to life intercepting six Phi 
Kap passes and winning 33-5. 
John Scango led the Kappa Sig at
tack. Sigma Nu also capitalized on 
pass interception, defeating the 
Phi Kaps 12-3.
Metals Club won its first game 
17-2 over Theta Xi. Once again 
TX failed to get an offense roll
ing.
Steelers
The Met Grads and Beta Theta 
Pi gained their berth in the play
offs at the expense of SAE Gold. 
Ben Patz at end make life miser
able for the SAEs in the 25-8 
Met Grad victory. Beta Theta Pi 
found SAE to be quite a bit more 
troublesome than the Met Grads 
did, but still picked up the 13-8 
game. Mike Aaron and Joe Old
field ran well for the Betas.
Eagles
The inevitable finally happened 
in the Eagle League as GSIA beat 
ATO A and formed a three way 
tie for first place. Fired up after 
losing to Citcom the Grads rolled 
to victory over ATO thus ending 
ATOs dominance in the league

afternoon in a triangular cross
country meet on the Schenley 
Park course.
This is Bruce Dobras big chance 
to break the CIT record of 24:01 
set by Eric Ottervik and Bill 
Whitman last year. Bruce ran a 
24:14 in the Slippery Rock meet 
two jveeks ago and has improved 
since then.
W & J is paced by Bill Milroth, 
the areas top milec. and halfmiler, with the rest of the team 
being composed of freshmen. St.
Francis ranks last in the WPC 
GSIA put insurance on their posiI standings, so the main attraction 
tion by defeating DU 10-9. DU \ of this race should be the Dobrasled 9-0 until GSIA exploded mid
way in the fourth quarter.
In other action Tau Delta Phi 
beat the SAE Lions 42-0all Tau 
Delt seniors scored touchdowns 
except Gil Friedman.
Season Ends

ship, KS and SN will decide the 
winner of the Bear League, and 
the Met Grads play Beta Theta Pi 
for leadership of the Steeler
Milroth battle.
West Virginia Meet
Next Thursday the team will 
travel to West Virginia for a con
test with the most highly-regarded 
team in the Tri-State area.
Dobras gave Paul Sanders of 
Westminster a real fight last Wed
nesday, but fell behind in the last 
mile of the race. Sanders finished 
15 seconds ahead of Dobras in 
26:03.
Glenn Klepac ran his best race 
of the season but lost to Tom 
Truxell, who was third in last 
' years WPC meet. In finishing
League. All six of these teams, fourth, Klepac was closely folwin or lose, will enter the playlowed by Pekitch and Shaw of the 
offs. The Eagle League is still unj host team,

Lack of Depth
Chamay ran very 
place seventh, but Tech was again 
without support from the fourth 
and fifth members, however, as 
Westminsters depth pulled out a 
23-34 victory.
The entire hopes of Coach Swaneys squad now depend on how 
much Bill Anderson, Bill Sproul, 
George Caldwell, and Bob Duke 
can improve for the West Penn 
meet two weeks hence. Two of 
these runners must fill the large 
gap that now exists between Dob
ras, Klepac, Chamay and the last 
two men,

Cc-rec VB off To 
A Bang-up Start
Co-rec volleyball is back in the limelight. From early in
dications, league races will be neck and neck affairs. QHse 
games will prevail as both leagues are stackedwith fine 
teams.
This forecaster has found it difficult to predict final 
league standings since the best looking teams have often 
played the poorest in early season efforts. The latest line on 
each team as gotten during last weeks fraternity parties is: 
American League 
ATO  stuff  good offense;
however, half the team is contin
ually on the defense.
SN Black KATpreseason 
record shows two dates and seven 
slapped faces.
Newman Ahalf the team 
looks good.
SAE]TKshould make out al
right.
BSRCo-edsmay win in a 
pinch.
ATOKKG36-22-36. *
National League
TDP and Chicksplans to make 
frequent use of time out huddles.
DUoffense geared to dimly lit 
courts.
Newman Bdefense may fail 
on full moon nights.
ATO Fratsthird team is a 
charm.
SN Gold DGa model team.
SAEDDDfigure to be in 
shape.
Opening Games
The regular co-rec volleyball 
season began last Thursday. In 
American League action, quite a 
few eye-openers were viewed. 
BSR-Co-eds took over the top 
slot by winning their first two 
games. They defeated ATO and 
Stuff 15-11, 15-2, and came back 
later to down SN Black KAT 
15-7, 4-15, 15-3. In other league 
action, SAE-TK stopped Newman 
A 15-2, 15-13; ATO and Stuff 
wound up playing .500 ball by 
winning over ATO-KKG 15-6, 
15-8.
National League Play
The big game here was played 
between TDP and Chicks and 
SAE-DDD. The latter group was 
last years champs with high hopes 
of a repeat. However, a deter
mined TDP and Chicks team 
came from behind in both sets to 
take the match 15-12, 16-14. In 
later action, TDP and Chicks 
moved into sole possession of first 
place by breezing past SN-DG 
15-0, 15-6.
In other league action, ATO 
Frat remained undefeated by 
defeating Newman B 15-8, 15-2. 
SN Gold-DG tied for second 
place by winning its opener over 
DU 15-6, 2-15, 15-9.
