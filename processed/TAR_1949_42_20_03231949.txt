The dearth of all-school dances ?---------------------------------------------------

pose a Student Council sponsored

Constitutional Changes 
Four changes in the old consti
tution were discussedn The first, 
dealing with the term of office for 
Council members, states that 
members will be elected for a 
term of one year, with elections 
held biannually during or before 
the first week in May and the 
second week in Decembern
The next change was designed 
to remedy a situation which 
arose last month concerning the 
election of officersn It reads: All 
officers except the secretary and 
assistant secretary will be elected 
by the combined old and new 
Councils in the next to the last 
meeting in the semester in which 
the new representatives are ac
ceptedn The change also states 
that officers must have been mem
bers of the old Counciln
Majority Changed 
Another of the revisions pro
vides, that Roberts Rules of arder 
shall govern all proceedings, ex
cept as specified by the constitu
tion or by-lawsn Councilman Mey
ers proposed that the majority 
necessary to amend the constitu
tion be two-thirds instead of 
three-quartersn
In the discussion following,
Henry Clay, quoting the Intra
mural Athltic handbook and the 
Constitution of the United States; 
supported the two-thirds number 
by pointing out that his figure is 
Used in both documentsn When 
discussion was concluded, the con

tirety by a standing Cote of 
Councilmembersn

Jack Johnson Presents 
Idea To Council Today
Proposals concerning class or
ganization and election of sep 
arate class officers will be pre
sented to Student Council todayn 
Senior IA Jack Johnson, using 
material from his aDK pledge 
project, will describe the exist
ing difficulties and outline a def
inite course of action which can 
be takenn
Convinced that the lack of in
tra-class activi
ties is largely 
responsible for 
the gnerai 
apathy of the 
student body 
and alumni, 
Johnson says, 
Separate class 
organizat ions 
and officers 
would serve not 
only to stimulate school 
spirit and class 
consciousne s s, 
but also to in
crease interest 
and activity among the alumnin 
Organize Freshmen
Basis of the suggested plan is 
the early organization of enter
ing freshmen through assemblies 
and social eventsn A class con
sciousness developed at an early 
date would serve to offset the de
partmental segregation coming 
latern
When practical, a president, 
three vice presidents, and secretary-treasurer would be chosen, 
with one vice president being 
elected from each of the schoolsn

Editorials
Simplifies Everything
Every once in a while a brilliant idea comes 
8long that makes us all wonder why we didnt 
think of itn The campus chest which was brought 
up at the Student Council recently is just such an 
- idean
It is one of those inexplicable mysteries 
that we have allowed ourselves to be bad
gered a dozen times a year by all the wor
thy organizations seeking funds When we 
could long ago have simplified the whole 
scheme of things by adopting this plan of 
having one unified annual drive.
However, before Student Council or any other 
organization plunges into this plan, worthy as 
it certainly is, let them be well aware that there 
is a tremendous amount of work involved in 
its successful operationn But when it is done 
the end will justify the meansn
The best organizational job and the most 
thoroughly thought out policy decisions wTill 
be required of those who undertake the pro
ject. The first year of such a program will 
be the toughest, but the entire student body, 
faculty, and administration w'ill be indebted 
to the operators for untangling what is now 
a rather burdensome situation.
Aid To Unity
It is high time for another Carnegie custom 
that died with the war to be revivedn The class 
organizations, cutt^ig across college and depart
ment lines, provided the common meeting ground 
for all the students that today seems to be miss
ing.
This void does not come from lack of 
spirit, but rather because energies are chan
nelled exclusively into areas that emphasize 
interest in a narrower group.
Although the class organizations become most 
valuable after graduation, the undergraduates 
could find a great deal of pleasure in class ac
tivities.
It is probably too late to do much more 
than name secretaries for the present senior 
class, but some groundwork done now, most 
logically by Student Council, would provide 
a basis for some really worthwhile class or
ganizations in future years.
Not Again
Social chairman of all those groups which will 
have banquets later in the spring will do them
selves, as well as their present and future mem
bers, a big favor by signing up those banquets 
in the Dean of Womens officen
Even though the Deans office has made 
no specific request that this be done, Ted 
Goodson, Social Chairman of Council, is 
showing good sense in pointing out the ad
vantages of using a clearing-house for the 
scheduling of such events.
It will be more than worth any bother in 
signing up such events to make sure that the 
confusion which reigned last spring is not re
peated.
If You Cant Beat Em., Join Em
Lang Charges Tartano o
Violates Principles
Editor, the Tartan:
Recent issues of the Carnegie Tartan have 
been inconsistent with the purpose of the publi
cation and in violation of the principles which 
should govern freedom of the pressn
In accrodance with the constitution of the 
Carnegie Tartan and by your own admission, you 
are responsible for everything printed within 
the pages of the Carnegie Tartann Therefore, 
I charge that you are using the Carnegie Tartan 
as an organ for suppressing and belittling the 
free expression of ideas which the campus has 
a right to hear and readn
Failed Responsibilities 
You have often voiced the opinion that free
dom of the press is a privilege to be used by the 
editor; but in doing this you have failed to 
carry responsibilities incurred at the same timen
The Carnegie Tartan is the only newspaper 
which is published for, and distributed to, the 
entire student bodyn It alone serves as the com
mon source of ideas for the studentsn
Accountable to Society
rast April the Commission on Freedom of 
the Press published its general report contain
ing these statements: The voice of the press, 
so far as by a drift toward monopoly it tends 
to become exclusive in its wisdom and observa
tion, deprives other voices of a hearing and the 
public of their contribution nnn It must be ac
countable to society for meeting the public need 
and for maintaining the rights of citizens and al
most forgotten rights of speakers who have no 
pressn It must know that its faults and errors 
have ceased to be private vagaries and have be
come public dangersn
Practice Restraint 
The time has arrived for your paper to face 
up to its responsibilitiesn The editorial policy 
which you have followed has not led to any im
provement in fraternity and independent rela
tionsn Unless you practice restraint in the exer
cise of your editorial power, the student body 
shall be justified in holding you accountable for 
these incriminationsn
Until you give complete freedom of expression 
in the Carnegie Tartan to the people whom you 
so impudently condemn there can be no free 
choice of ideas by the students of Carnegie Techn
Respectfully yours, 
Arbon Cn rang 
Mgmtn Sophn
(We are happy to welcome Mr. Lang to the 
pages of the Carnegie Tartan. We have been re
questing him for many months to take advantage 
of this column.Ed.)

Early Scheduling 
Of Banquets
Organizations and honoraries 
holding banquets during the 
spring semester may avoid the 
congestion and confusion that 
occurred a year ago by sign
ing up their banquets in the 
Dean of Womens office, Student 
Council Social chairman Ted 
Goodson suggested this week.
According to the White Book 
regulations, each organization 
is allowed one closed function 
each year which must be held 
on a week night and must be 
over by 10 p. m. Last year the 
mashed-potato circuit got into 
high gear immediately after 
Spring Carnival, and lack of 
planning caused one, two, or 
three banquets to be scheduled 
on the same night.
As a result, a number of stu
dents found themselves unable 
to attend some of the banquets.
The social schedule kept in 
the Dean of Womens office will 
make it possible to avoid sim
ilar conflicts this year, Goodson 
said.

Summary
Final Individual 
Scoring Leaders
Three Teams Tie For
American League Title
Kappa Sig A, Freshman Architects, 
Beta Non 1 Delay Basketball Playoffs
In its greatest season since before the war, Carnegie Techs in
tramural basketball program produced an eye-lifter last week when 
three teams tied for first place in the American league racen
The deadlock has necessitated a playoff between Kappa Sigma A,
Freshman Architects, and Betas 
Non 1, delaying the dates of the 
playoff between the three league 
champions for the school titlen  
Upsets Galore 
After running up a string of
eight consecutive wins, the Kap
pa Sigs fell apart at the seams and
lost to PiKA and the Architectsn 
With only one remaining game to 
play, the Architects seemed to 
have the title cinched, only to 
lose to the twice-beaten Stanley 
Steamersn
This produced a virtual four
way tie for the leagues top rungn 
The Betas, however, eliminated 
the Steamers in the final sched
uled game of the seasonn
Records Set 
In looking back over the past 
season, the higher caliber of play 
was seen to set several intramural 
recordsn The first record that fell 
by the wayside was the individual 
scoring markn
TNT Bs Tasso Katselas netted 
51 points in a game against the 
Tau Deltsn Then John Gordon, 
scoring star of the Big Five, erased 
this mark from the record books 
by pouring 6g points through the 
hoop against Phi Kappa Bn A 
team scoring high was chalked up 
by the fast-stepping Freshman 
Architects when they smothered 
ScobeU Hall 113-3en
Individual Scorers 
Tabulation of the individual 
scoring leaders for the year show
ed that Katselas and Gordon were 
far ahead of the rest of the field, 
with averages of 3en8 and ggn6 
points per game respectivelyn The 
American league showed Thomp
son of the Freshman Architects 
and Motter of Kappa Sigma as its 
leading point menn
The official score book for the 
Federal league was taken from

WEDNESDAY, MARCH g3, 19e9THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Gridders Open 
Spring Drills
Optimism Is Felt 
About Coming Season
Apparently undisturbed by their 
winless reputation of recent years, 
Carnegie Techs fighting Tartans 
opened their spring football drills 
on Monday with all of the vigor 
of a championship contender as 
the new coaching regime of Drn 
Eddie Baker and Eddie Hirschberg officially took officen
averflowing with the same op
timistic spirit which has been 
prevalent in all of the Plaids re
cent gridiron teams, the entire 
squad seemed confident that their 
new tutors and the split-T forma
tion were the factors which would 
provide Carnegie with its first 
victorious season since 19egn Even 
the two ex-Pitt stars ^vho were 
succeeding Wild Bill Donohoe at 
the helm held high hopes for a 
winning season next falln
Drn Baker, whose McKeesport 
pro team had won 19 straight con
tests before his resignation last 
year, will also be aided by the 
veterans A1 Irwin and Walter 
Burns in his coaching dutiesn In 
addition, several former Carnegie 
gridders including Cirgil Cantini, 
backfield coach for the past three 
years, and Johnny Schmidt, cen
ter on the 1938 Sugar Bowl team, 
will be utilized on scouting assign
mentsn
No closing date has been placed 
on the current drills as yet, al
though the coaches have expressed 
a desire to wind up the prelimi
nary sessions with outdoor work 
sometime after the Easter recessn
All-Star Team
In next weeks issue, the Tar
tan will announce its All-In
tramural basketball team. Three 
teams will be selected by the 
Managers Club, the referees, 
and the sports staff of the Tar
tan. It is expected that more 
than thirty ballots will be cast 
in an effort to get a good cross 
sectional vote of the three leagues.
Tartan Mermaids 
Compete In Skibo 
Pool On Saturday
Womens swimming teams from 
Carnegie Tech and Pitt will com
pete in the Intercollegiate Tele
graphic meet in the CIT pool on 
Saturday at g:0 pn mn The swim
ming times will be telegraphed 
to national headquarters, compar
ed with those of other schools, 
and telegraphed back to us if we 
place in the top time scoresn
Events to be held will be a 75 
yard medley consisting of g5 
yards of breaststroke, g5 yards of 
front crawls, and g5 yards of back 
crawln
Also included will be e0 yard

and breaststroke, and a 100 yard 
free style event in which e swim

Those participating will be the 
Misses Butts, Deneen, Douglass, 
Gelman, Godden, Holzworth, rinbeck, Menger, Metcalf, arr, Rantenberg, Rudd, Jn Walker, Sn 
Walder, Johnson, Watson, George, 
and asbornen
Track Team Hampered By 
Weather; Needs Pole Vaulters
After a month and a half of practice, the Carnegie Tech track 
team is in fairly good condition in spite of the obstacles they had 
to overcomen The team has been forced to do most of their practic
ing in the gym or in Schenley Park as a result of inclement 
weather conditions and the poor*
shape of the trackn
Determining the varsity team 
still looms as a big question for 
coach Halferty, although it was 
lessened yesterday when time 
trials were held in the running 
eventsn Some of the lads who have 
shown promise are ruchok, Minnich, Wilson, and veteran Cassler 
in the sprints; and Dorman, Al
berts, Cockrell, and Captain Dav
ies in the distant runningn
Hurdlers Practice
The field men havent had much 
chance to work out as yet, with 
the exception of the hurdlers, who 
have been doing a little practice 
in the gymn Those that appeared 
outstanding in the AAU meet 
were hurdlers Hamman, Wiewel, 
and Minnich; ruchok in the broad
jump; high jumpers Hamman and 
Washburn; and shot putter Kistlern
As of this date, there have been 
no candidates for the pole vaultn 
Anyone who is interested should 
report to coach Halferty as soon 
as possible and help to strengthen 
the team in this eventn
Sports Conflict
With the coming of spring foot
ball practice, the worries of the 
coach will be increased, sincc 
many of this years team are grid
ders and the two sports will be 
conflictingn
As soon as the weather clears, 
the team will begin intensified 
training outside, and should be 
ready for their first meet at Case 
on April g3n

Carnegie Tech wrestlers wil enter their final competition of the 
year tomorrow in the National Junior AAU matches at the down
town YMCAn
Sponsored by the Allegheny Mountain association,' the meet 
will begin in the afternoon with* 
the lightweight matches and con
tinue through the eveningn
Chance Exists 
Stiff competition is expected in 
all classes, for W & J, Waynesburg and all the leading colleges, 
high schools and boys clubs will 
be representedn
Although the Plaid grapplers* 
have an unimpressive record of 
one victory and five defeats, a 
chance remains for a few Tartan 
wrestlers to place in the tourneyn
Regardless of the outcome, the 
AAU meet will provide an oppor
tunity for the Carnegie Tech team
to gain some much needed ex
perience and possibly a little of 
the glory they have missedn
Must Enjoy It
The wrestling team is not ac
tually a varsity squad but is com
posed mainly of hard-working 
men who placed in the intra
mural and wrestle because they 
enjoy itn
With $g500 worth of equip
ment and the services oi an ex
perienced coach already on hand, 
team members hope that next fall 
will see the initiation of a varsity 
team and inter-collegiate compe
titionn

Editorial
Servant Without A Master
Each year the editor of the Plaid writes an editorial al
most every week on some subject which in his opinion has 
some interest for the students. Very often these are of a con
troversial nature and the editor asks for remarks from his 
readers on the subject, Either he flatters himself in thinking 
that he has readers or else those readers just are not inter
ested for there are never any replies.
W e often give our ideas on actions by Evening Student 
Council. We wonder as we write if our thoughts are the same 
as yours. We never find out, A recent editorial concerned the 
action of student council in rejecting the invitation from the 
Pitt Evening Student Association to join with them in sponsor
ing a dance. Another sugested the revival of all school elec
tions.
These and several others should have merited some re
joinder by the student body. Unfortunately, none was forth
coming. Student council and its official voice, the Plaid, are 
your servants. But the servant is helpless without his mas
ters voice. Your governing group does its best but they are 
working strictly on their own. They have no way of know
ing what your wishes are.
The easiest way of expressing your opinion is through 
letters to the editor. We also want to know what you are 
doing in your work and in your outside activities. Any honors 
that you may receive for papers that you write or promotions 
that you get are of interest to the other students. Remember 
that the Plaid is your paper and it can best serve 3Tou if you 
tell us what you want.

Just when a fellow gets into his

a few days ago that some of the 
evening school engineers were dis

of golf, and now they must be 
content in spending their swing

Incidentally what has happened 
to the golf tournaments that Even

There were twenty-three pledges present as well as about twenty 
membersn Guests included Miss Josephine Campbelln Dean of Women,
?and Mrsn Rosalie Hagins, Carnegie

hard to realize why this is an 
affair of long standing when you 
hear of all the good time, that the

these affairsn Theres another 
maxim that holds water: a satis
