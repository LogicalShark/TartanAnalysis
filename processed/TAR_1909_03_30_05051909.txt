Prof. Kellar told us of a very hard problem he 
gave a man to work. The man could not work it 
and Mr. Kellar was delighted. Now what we want 
to know is whether Mr. Kellar can work it. He 
failed to mention that in his story.
Professor Hower advises us to pose in red light 
before going to a party and in blue light after our 
return. The idea should be patented. However, 
we are too young for such strenuous methods at the 
present time.

Youll not go with me, mother dear, to see the May

On Saturday, April 24th, Miss Bradt took the 
Senior Household Arts Class through the Duquesne 
Club. This is a part of the field work of the course 
in Institutional Management.
Mr. Brewer, the manager, very kindly showed us 
everything of interest and explained the use and 
workings of the various mechanical devices and 
labor-saving machines.
We first visited the kitchens, where we saw the 
twenty-four chefs at work preparing breakfast. The 
head chef opened the refrigerators that we might 
see the meats already prepared for cooking. Here 
were everything from squabs to whole beeves.
In the bake shop were five bakers who were busy 
with turnovers and French pastries. These looked 
very good, but we did not have an opportunity to 
sample them, so we cannot say whether or not they 
came up to the Household Arts standard!
In the store room we saw the butter cutter and ice 
cutting machine for use in preparing butter pats 
and ice for the table. Passing through the corridor 
we were greeted by an awfully good smell, and 
following, our noses we came to the wine cellar. 
Here Miss Benner, noticing little bottles of orangecolored liquid, exclaimed, Just see the cute bottles 
of olive oil! Miss Wood side was the only member 
of the class who who was able to identify the con
tents at sight! Who would have thought it!
Next we visited the dining rooms. The private 
dining rooms were prepared for luncheon and looked 
very attractive. Next we went to the laundry, where 
we saw the largest mangle made. It is able to turn 
out twelve thousand pieces daily. The Club also has 
its own power plant and an ice plant for cold storage.
We spent a very pleasant morning going through 
the building and greatly appreciate Mr. Brewers 
kindness in personally conducting the expedition and 
explaining things so carefully.

Oh, woman, you are charming,
And poets long have sung 
Their sweetest verses to you 
In every written tongue,
But none of them has ever 
Told why it is that you 
Will always leave a street car

I cannot sing my best on Spring
That happy time of song;
Sometimes in Summer I cannot 
Hum a note when days are long;
It will not then surprise invoke 
If, when the dead leaves fall,
My lyric fires gone up in smoke,
I cannot sing at all.
| WHITE FRIARS |
c2Gi Nf 0CNhK2Ci ^Gi q5a
All arrangements for presenting the White Friars 
show, His Highness, the Chef, in Sewickley, have 
been made. No better place than Pittsburgs most 
exclusive suburb could be chosen for the first per
formance, for, while the most critical audiences 
usually make allowance for a production that sails 
under college covers, the amateur standard and 
acted up to by the society people of the Valley in 
their own frequent theatricals, is so high that the 
typical Sewickley audience is the best judge of ama
teur work that could be found. If the White Friars 
can give a show to their liking, it is safe anywhere 
else.
There were no rehearsals held last Saturday in 
order to give the men a chance to attend the Mask 
and Wig Club of the University of Pennsylvanias 
Merely a Monarch. Nearly all of the men in the 
cast and chorus were present at either one or the 
other of the two performances, and some went to 
both, all receiving many valuable hints, as lots of 
new stunts and dances were seen.
Last week saw the .completion of the last of the 
chorus girls and cast gowns that were being made 
to order by the Joseph Horne Co. For this item 
alone, over $500 has been spent. A number of pho
tographs of members of the cast were taken early 
in the week, and will, in all probability, be used in 
advance advertising.
All pictures of this years show are to be taken by 
Sleeth, the photographer, located in the Home Trust 
Building, and will be on sale in the different thea
tres after each performance.
The itineracy of the trip to be taken up to date is, 
May 15, one performance (evening) Auditorium, Se
wickley; May 21, one performance (evening) New 
Castle; May 27, one performance (evening) Majes
tic, Butler; May 29, two performances (afternoon 
and evening), Nixon, Pittsburg. The entire com
pany, numbering over 50 men, including the orches
tra, will be carried in all places on the schedule.
Nearly all the patronesses for the Sewickley per
formance has been secured, but the list is not as 
yet quite complete. At the time of going to press 
it included:
Miss Lucy Bittinger, Mrs. H. L. Bixby, Mrs. C. W. 
Brown, Mrs. M. S. Burns, Mrs. W. O. Campbell, Mrs. 
Geo. H. Clapp, Mrs. Jas. C. Cooke, Mrs. J. T. Findlay,

Upon careful investigation it has been discovered 
that there are very few of the student body who 
make enough use of the Carnegie Institute to know 
much about what it contains. Beyond the Library, 
which is as far as many have ever gotten in point 
of advancement to culture, is an almost unlimited 
opportunity for the man of science, the artist, the 
musician, or the artisan to see the best that has 
been done in his own particular line of endeavor, or 
in any other, since the beginning of the world. A 
thorough knowledge of the buildings is a liberal 
education in itself, and if it is neglected, one of the 
educational assets of the Carnegie Technical Schools 
that cannot be approached by any other school or 
college of which we have any knowledge, might as 
well be in Hong Kong. There is not a single student 
in Tech who, for the sake of his own education, can, 
afford to neglect one of the best Institutes in the 
country.
The editors desire to correct a mistake that in
advertently crept into the announcement of the 
prices that the White Friars are charging for their 
show, 'His Highness, the Chef, that will be given 
at the Nixon Theater on May 29. 'There will be no 
$2.00 seats; the highest price to be charged is $1.50.

The base-ball team has certainly been having a 
tough break on the weather question. Practice for 
the week has been practically impossible on account 
of the almost incessant downfall of rain. The game 
for Thursday with Qherlin may have to be canceled 
unless the management is able to secure the Pitts
burg College grounds. This will make the third
postponement of the opening of the new field, and 
there is' some talk of not opening it officially until 
next fall. On Saturday Tech is scheduled to meet 
their old rivals, the University of Pittsburg, and if 
our field is not in condition D. A. C. Park, in Wilkinsburg, may be the scene of the contest. Tech 
lost one of its best pitchers when Stockwell was 
forced to go home.
His father is a large contractor and wanted him 
to manage some department of a project for which 
he has just closed a contract. Barclay has been out 
with a wrenched knee, but will be back in the game 
this week. Barclay is going to play left field on the 
Collegians this summer. The Collegians are com
posed of the pick of the colleges, and the fact that 
Tech is going to be represented on this team is a 
credit to the school. The rest of the fellows are all 
in good condition, and if the weather ever permits 
practice they should get into winning form in a 
short time. Red Kirk has fixed up his school trou
bles and will be seen at his old position at short.

The Board of Control imet on Monday evening and 
disposed of considerable business. On account of 
the continued postponement of the field opening 
made necessary by the inclement weather, the Board 
decided to postpone the opening till next spring and 
not attempt to play any games on the field this 
spring. It was decided to discontinue basket-ball 
for one year. J. S. Charles was elected treasurer, 
vice Mr. Leeds, and Fitzharris was elected assistant 
manager of the base-ball team.
The question of a coach for next seasons foot-ball 
team was disposed of by electing Mr. iSnitzer, last 
years assistant coach.

The Freshmen Base-ball team will play the Alle

game is expected. The following Saturday, May 
15th, the Freshmen aggregation will go to Saltsburg, 
where they will meet the Kiski second. Shorty

The second annual banquet of the 'Class of 1912, 
Night, was held on Saturday evening, April 24, at 
the Fort Pitt Hotel.
There were in attendance three members of the 
faculty., Messrs. Aude, Hower, and Willett, twentyfive active members of the class and three who have 
retired.
After a well-served feed, Mr. Newman, E. M. and 
toastmaster, introduced Mr. W. B. McCreery, who 
described minutely the process of making armor 
plate.
Mir. Aude next addressed the assembly. He com
pared the course in the Night School to a race of five 
laps, and pointed out many interesting parallels be
tween the two.
Mr. Flick related experiences When I was a boy, 
and incidentally indulged quite freely in the joy of 
being a Night student.
Mr. Hower spoke on subjects non-scholastic.
Mr. Keagy, the Smile expert, discussed at some 
length on his favorite subject. During his discourse, 
the thought flashed up in our mind, If Edwina could 
only see him no>w!
Prof. Willett entered into a scathing arraignment 
of the American farmer, and just to prove his sin
cerity, offered to dispose of his farm to any one 
present.
We, the one time editor of the Womans Page, 
after being unmercifully lauded by the worthy toast
master, being very much chastened in spirit, did not 
succeed in rousing some of the sleepy ones.
The feature of the evening was the splendid ren
dition of the comic opera, Belshazzar, by our old 
accomplice, Jerome Aloysius Ignatius. Its effect 
was simply stupendous. It was noted that every one 
sat up and took notice at once. After completing 
this feat, Mr. Lonergan announced his total unpreparedness to speak to so honorable an assembly, 
and forthwith pulled out from beneath his garments 
a parchment, closely written with words of wisdom, 
which he offered as his contribution to Education.
After several attempts to disperse, the honorable 
Mr. Mertens struck the reminiscent gait and rolled 
out one after another with the effect that several 
other gentlemen also arose and stood.
In writing his closing remarks for this season, 
the editor of this class wishes to thank his appreN N

it almost leads one to the belief that a caieer 
behind an authors desk is ones most fitting-voca
tion. But also, and alack, we realize with sorrow, 
that, to be a successful author, requires seven years 
membership in the Ananias Club and thenthe 
jungle.
Nevertheless, notwithstanding, and in spite there
of let us be of good cheer, for hath not even Leroy 
been elevated to the exalted position of a Maker of 
History, after faithful service as an ink-slinger? 
Yea, verily, to him who waits come many things.
Let us, therefore, with a full understanding of our 
several relations, part to meet again. In the bright 
future there gleams a day when to the multiplicity 
of joyful acclamations, we shall, jointly and sever

Then on that fateful day, who shall say, Thou 
hast flunked? What doest thou here? shall receive 
the noisome guffaw, for behold we shall have passed 
the bar, with not one missing.
Again, let us then, in our passings to and fro dur

steadfast purpose we have set before us, let us look 
forward with joy to the' day -when one shall say 
Look whos here.

Some questions Ill give you, one day, said a Prof, 
Please give me true answers, and dont put me off. 
A few' of the questions I give you below,
And some of the answers. The rest I don't know. 
What books, and how many this year have you read? 
Just two, Blood for Blood and The Pirate, Black 
Ned! 
How often do you visit our li-(ber-a-ree ?
Once a day, sir, for thats where my sweetheart I 
see.
For natural gas, whats the price in our town?
Its free when a few of our Profs are around.
And now comes a stinger, tis easy to see,
In Smokeville, what costeth electricity?
To answer that question you neednt be smart, 
Same as regular currants, just ten cents a quart.
I dont know the rest; as he gives it, he grins 
Just wiiy is a pink-footed mouse when it spins?
Is reading the papers, a duty you shirk?
I read all the want ads; I'm looking for work.
Just one more small question, and then I will close. 
Why is it a common electric car goes?
 The motorman might be the answer, I see,
But the best one is just personality!*Anon Y. Mouse.
