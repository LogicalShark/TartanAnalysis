SriS Proposes 
Neiv Theater Stage 
For Ballroom
The Board of Scotch n Soda, 
in search of a new home in the 
Skibo Activities Center, has pro
posed a plan for a theater. They 
have invited senior architects Ed 
Jacobson and Carl Piekarski to 
design a portable, unitized stage 
for the ballroom.
Recognizing the present stage to 
be inadequate, it is believed that 
the addition could add to the func
tional operation of Skibo. It would 
not only be used by Scotch n Soda, 
but would also serve for concerts 
and skits.
The two architects have con
ceived a plan utilizing a series of 
boxes and lids of standard size 
that could be butted together or 
stacked for changable depths and 
levels.
Definite plans are promised by 
April 1. Construction would conI tinue for three weeks, leaving S n 
i S two weeks to rehearse on stage

By Joey
It is seldom that a television program can capture for 
me the color and excitement of a live theatrical perform
ance, but the Columbia Broadcasting System, Leonard Bern
stein, and Georges Bizet together with a most talented cast 
kept me literally on the edge of my seat watching a splendid 
presentation of THE DRAMA OF CARMEN.
After the stirring prologue to Bizets CARMEN, Mr. 
Bernstein explained to the television audience that the com
poser had orginally intended his work to be an opera 
comique and not a grand opera.
What is the difference? Simply 
that Bizet wrote sung arias with 
spoken passages and did not write 
the sung recitatives which are 
performed everywhere toe ay ex
cept at Paris Opera Comique.
Jane Rhodes, Parisian mezzo 
soprano sang the title role with a 
passion and fury rarely heard to
day. Here Habernera was a 
flirtatious delight and her Sequidilla was magnificently staged 
by William Graham: Miss Rhodes 
tied up Don Jose figuratively 
with her singing and quite liter
ally with her rope. New York 
critics have recently reprimanded 
the singer for her realistic treat
ment of Salomes Dance of the 
Seven Veils at the Metropolitan 
Opera House! Although her Car
men is fully dressed, I am sure 
she is no less erotic than Strauss 
princess. Don Jose was beautiful
ly sung by William Olvis. Bernstt followers will remember 
him for his excellent portrayal of 
the Governor of Buenos Aires in 
CANDIDE. Also from the cast of 
that operetta came William Chap
man who gave much strength to 
Zuniga.
Representing Bizet as a drama
tist were Zohra Lampert as the 
speaking Carmen and James 
Congdon as her Jose. Miss Lam
pert played Warren Beattys 
young Italian wife in SPLENDOR 
IN THE GRASS and almost saved 
the film from mediocrity. Al
though she was forced to act here 
with a wooden and unbelievable 
lover, she put a fantastic amount 
of life into her character. Her 
seduction scene in Act II at the 
inn of Pastia was unforgettable!
Lee Venora and Janis Martin 
played the gypsies, Frasquita and 
Mercedes. Their third act trio 
with Miss Rhodes added much to 
the program.
But the real champion of the 
evening was Leonard Bernstein 
who always seems to come out on 
top! His narrations were direct, 
short and extremely informative.
He let his audience know immedi
ately that he thought the com
pletely sung version of CARMEN 
was untrue to Bizet and after one 
hour and a half proved beyond 
a doubt how right he was. If the 
opera houses of the world dont 
want this masterpiece of combin
ed singing and speaking then 
other theatres should put it into 
their repertories. And .f that is I 
impossible, then C.B.S. can repeat 
THE DRAMA OF CARMEN 
nee a year and plan it so that it 
comes opposite N.B.C.s AMAHL 
AND THE NIGHT VISITORS or 
PETER PAN.

SHAKESPEARE DOESNT LIVE HERE 
ANY MORE
A recent and most heartening development in American college 
life has been the emergence of the artist-in-residence. In fact, 
the artist-in-residence has becQine as familiar a sight on campus 
as Latin ponies, leather elbow patches, Rorschach tests, hula 
hoops, and Marlboro cigarettes.
And we all know how familiar that isI mean Marlboro ciga
rettes. And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning 
is king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules 
supreme, should not Marlboro be everyones favorite? The same 
good sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry 
or solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you 
come to pick a cigarette. You look for a flavor that is flavorful, 
a filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You 
look, in short, for Marlboroand happily you dont have to look 
far. Marlboro is available at your friendly tobacconists or vend
ing machine, wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states and 
Las Vegas.
But I digress. We were speaking of the new campus phenome
nonthe artist-in-residencea man or woman who writes, 
paints, or composes right on your very own campus and who is 
also available for occasional consultations with superior students.
Take, for example, William Cullen Sigafoos, artist-in-residence 
at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identifi
cation.
As we all know, Mr. Sigafoos has been working for many years 
on an epic poem in rhymed couplets about the opening of the 
Youngstown-Akron highway. Until, however, he went into 
residence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Finger
print Identification, his progress was not what you would call 
rapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet we all 
know: They speed along on .wheels of rubber, rushing home in 
time for subber . ..
Then Mr. Sigafoos got stuck. It is not that his muse deserted 
him; it is that he became involved in a series of time-consuming 
episodesa prefrontal lobotomy for Irwin, his faithful sled 
dog; fourteen consecutive months of jury duty on a very com
plicated case of overtime parking; getting his coattail caught in 
the door of a jet bound for Brisbane, Australia; stuff like that.
He was engaged in a very arduous job in Sanduskyposing 
for a sculptor of hydrantswhen an offer came from the Toledo 
College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification to take 
up residence there, finish his magnum opus and, from time to 
time, see a few gifted students.
Mr. Sigafoos accepted with pleasure and in three short years 
completed the second couplet of his Youngstown-Akron Turnpike 
epic: The highway is made of solid concrete and at the toll station you 
get a receipt.
hf ft truth?"one.
Then a few gifted students came to visit him. They were a 
prepossessing lotthe boys with corduroy jackets and long, 
shaggy beards; the girls also with corduroy jackets but with 
beards neatly braided.
What is truth? said one. What iR beauty?' said another.
"Should a writer live first and write later or should he write 
and do a little living in his spare time? said another.
How do you find happinessand having found it, how do 
you get rid of it? said another.
Whither are we drifting? said another.
I dont know whither you are drifting, said Mr. Sigafoos, 
but as for me, I am drifting back to Sandusky to pose for the 
hydrant sculptor.
And back he went, alas, leaving only a fragment of his Youngs
town-Akron Turnpike epic to rank with other such uncom
pleted masterpieces as Schuberts Unfinished Symphony, the 
Venus de Milo, and Singers Midgets. iimMuswi
* * *
Take cheer, good friends, from one masterpiece that is complete. We, refer, of course, to Marlboro cigarettes. Filter 
end and tobacco end are both as good as tobacco artistry 
and science can make tlienu

PLT Honors 
Cohen, Broadhead
Phyllis Cohen and Susan 
Broadhead were selected to repre
sent Tech as guests at a luncheon 
Saturday, March 3, at the Century 
Club. An alumni chapter of Phi 
Lambda Theta, national honorary 
educational fraternity sponsored 
the luncheon.
Phyllis, a piano major, is sec
retary of Alpha Epsilon Phi, Rose 
Chairman in Sigma Alpha Iota, a 
membe" of Cwens, student con
ductor of Cameron Choir, and 
conductor of the Carnegie Awards 
Choir. Susan, an English major, 
is president of Cwens and first 
vice president of Kappa Alpha 
Theta. Both girls were freshman 
camp counselors in 1961 and led 
their respective sororities in 
Greek Sing last Friday.
The purpose of the luncheon, 
given annually for two sophomore 
education majors from every 
Pittsburgh college, is to inspire 
these girls to continue prepara
tion for entering the teaching pro
fession.
Phyllis recently received an ad
ditional honor: she was chosen 
WRYT Woman of the Day for 
March 1 because she conducts the 
Carnegie Awards Choir.
International Club Presents 
Debate on Nuclear Testing
The recent revival of interest 
has made nuclear disarmament 
again a topical matter at Tech. 
While motives and opinions must 
remain open to question, the par
ticipation of a student group from 
Tech in the demonstrations in 
Washington has shown an affir
mative concern in such matters of 
import.
International Club believes the 
question of whether or not to 
test to be one of crucial import
ance. It is one to which, perhaps, 
there can be no one answer at all 
times. It is one to which many 
arguments apply and it is one in 
which human: at large is emot.'onally involved. Therefore it is 
a question to which debates, which 
may lead to a clarification of 
ideas, should be devoted: men are 
perplexed but must make up their 
minds.
The Clubs next meeting will 
take the form of such a forum. 
Two scientists and two laymen 
will represent the two sides of a 
divided society. One scientist and 
one non-scientist will take one of 
the two sides of the issue at 
stake: Should we or should we not 
test?
Taking the stand that testing 
should not be resumed will be Dr. 
Lincoln Wolfenstein, physicist and
! member of the Carnegie Tech 
| faculty, and Mr. John Lofton, edi! torial correspondent for the 
Pittsburgh Post Gazette. On be
half of the attitude that a rea
sonable case, scientific political, 
and moral, can be made for the 
resumption of testing, Dr. David 
Fowler of the History Department 
and Dr. Edward R. Schatz, Dean 
of Research and Development 
here at Tech.
We can expect, perhaps, no final 
answers from this discussion. It is 
possibly significant that in an
other, larger forum the solution 
was equivocal. A citizens duty, 
it was said, is to back his govern
ment; his problem is how to be
come a member of the remnant.
The International Club meeting 
will be held in Skibo, on Sunday, 
March 25, at 8:30 p.m. in the Ball 
Room. Members and non-mem
bers, natives and foreigners are 
all cordially invited. Tea and 
coffee will follow the meeting.
