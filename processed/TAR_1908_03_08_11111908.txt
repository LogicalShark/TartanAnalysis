WOOSTER GAME
The forward pass was used to great advantage by 
both teams, both quarterbacks proving adepts in the 
play. The visitors during the first half carried the 
ball to the 2-yard line by two successive forward 
passes, from where Harrison pierced the Tech line 
for the first touchdown. Hittner, not to be outdone, 
started in at the same game, and with Beeken work
ing them for large gains time and time again. Six 
of these ground gaining plays in succession placed 
the ball on the Wooster 3-yard line, where they were 
held for downs. Tech, receiving the ball on a punt 
from Beck, brought the ball back to the ".-yard line, 
and would probably have scored but for the whistle 
ending the half.
During the second half, Hittner electrified the 
crowd by carrying the ball 75 yards through a broken 
field for a touchdown. This was the most spectacu
lar play seen on the Tech grounds this season. Tech 
supporters were thrown into a frenzy, it being ten 
minutes before quiet was restored, enabling the quar
terback to announce signals. This was the only 
score made by Tech.
Hittner was the star. His end running and returning 
of punts was responsible for holding the visitors safe. 
During the first half he was injured but gamely stuck 
to his post. Beeken and Patterson, at the extremi
ties, played a strong game, not many gains being 
made around the ends. In the backfield, Schmucker 
and Brown were the heavy ground gainers. The line 
was rather weak ^nd was responsible for most of the 
large gains made by the heavy backs of the oppon
ents.
The work of the visitors backfield in line plunging 
was a feature of the game. Harrison, at fullback, 
was the chief ground gainer for the black and gold. 
He was used continuously and responded each time
by plowing through the Tech line for large gains. 
Beck out-kicked Brown, the former averaging 45 
yards. His spiral kicks were found rather difficult 
to handle and resulted in many fumbles. Meldrum, 
at quarterback, ran his team in a classy manner 
and showed good form at the forward pass.
It was shortly after 3 oclock when Brown kicked 
off to Garwin on the 10-yard line, the latter returning 
it 20 yards. A forward pass by Meldrum failed and 
Wooster penalized 15 yards. Beck punted 40 yards 
to Brown, who returned 8 yards. Wooster held Tech 
on downs. A forward pass by Meldrum and France 
put the ball on Techs eight-yard line. Another for
ward pass from Meldrum to Beck placed the ball on 
the two-yard line. Two line plunges proved unavail
able, and on the third try Harrison went over for 
the first touchdown. Meldrum kicked goal. Score 
Wooster 6, Tech 0.
Tech Scores One Touchdown.
This was all the scoring that was done during the 
first half. Tech, by successful use of the forward 
pass, carried the ball to the five-yard line, where 
the whistle cheated them out of a probable touch
down.
During the early part of the second period Wooster 
resorted to Becks kicking. In this manner they suc
ceeded in bringing the ball into Tech'? territory, 
from where, by a series of line plunges, Kelly went 
around for the second touchdown. Meldrum failed 
at goal. ScoreWooster 11, Tech 0.
Wooster annexed two points by scoring a safety. 
A bad pass to Brown on Techs two-yard line was 
responsible. Brown, in recovering, was tackled be
hind the goal line. This finished the scoring of 
Wooster.

---------------------------------------------------

4THETA RTAN
During the remaining period of the game Hittner 
was the whole show, his end runs for 15 and 25 yards 
bordering on the sensational. He made the neatest 
run of the season when he received the ball on his 
own 35-yard line, and, running through the entire 
team, evading and dodging tacklers, placed the ball 
between the posts. Brown neatly annexed the goal.
Between the halves the Tech rooters, headed by 
the school band, marched lock step about the field, 
cheering and singing. Line-up:

WHITE FRIARS.
Elect New Officers and Adopt Constitution.
The officers who engineered the production of last 
years show with all those who took part in the cast 
and the chorus of the show ,held a business meet
ing two weeks ago for the purpose of clearing up 
unfinished business and adopting a constitution. At 
this meeting it was voted to form the White Friars 
Club of those officers, cast, and chorus who put on 
last years show, and to refer a constitution that 
had been presented for consideration, to an elected 
committee for that purpose. The meeting adjourned 
to meet the following week and take action on the 
proposed constitution on the recommendation of the 
committee, hear the reports of the business manager 
and treasurer, and as soon as anything definite was 
done about a constitution, to declare an election and 
fill the places created by the constitution. All of this 
was done at the meeting last Wednesday night.
For the information of the students, it might not 
be out of place to give a brief sketch of the way in 
which the dramatic club, or the White Friars was 
formed, and how it happened to be in active opera
tion for a year without any constitution. The first
attempt at anything of the kind was made three years 
ago, when Mr. F. E. Foster agitated the subject, 
called a meeting for discussing the 11 ject, and was 
elected to the office of manager, with David Challinor 
as his assistant. During the school year nothing be
yond the choosing of the present name was done as 
it had been commenced too late in the season. 
The next year, shortly before the Christmas vacation, 
a meeting of the Plebe class was held for the pur
pose of discussing plans for the formation of a class 
dramatic club. Mr. L. W. Nicols was elected pi'esident, and the name chosen wras The Comedy Club. 
This was no sooner done than committees were ap
pointed for the purpose of selecting a piay, and for 
the arranging of a place in which it could be given.
The members of the inactive White Friars, hearing 
of the class movement, called a meeting and decided 
that it would be all the Schools could do tc keep one 
dramatic club in operation, and that club could be no 
other than the club of the Schools. The members 
of the Comedy Club were invited to meet with the 
older organization and were then invited to join 
that one, if the class affair were given up as a class 
affair. This was agreed to, and Foster resigned; 
Nicols being elected to fill his place. He at once 
expressed himself as being in favor of giving a per
formance that year, and delaying the adoption of 
any form of a constitution until at least one public 
performance should be given and the experience ob
tained thereby incorporated into the constitution. 
This was agreed to, and a new committee appointed 
to look into the selection of a proper play for the 
attention of the White Friars. The same one the 
Comedy Club had selected, The Title Mart, by 
Winston Churchhill, was at the time thought to be 
the proper one. Calls for candidates were issued 
and met with only a luke-warm response. About this 
time the original promoters voted Nicols the power 
and authority to act in the capacity of president, 
to be called such, and have the right to appoint addi
tional officers, committees, or the like, being held re
sponsible at all times to the original promoters for 
anything done. D. D. Mitchell was appointed secre
tary and treasurer, M. M. Steen having been elected 
business manager at the first meeting.
Rehearsals and trials for places on the cast were 
held before an appointed faculty committee consist
ing of Miss West and Dr. Hoakonson. When the 
progress had been sufficient to warrant it, those in 
charge began to consider coaches, and decided that 
Mr. Walter B. Edmundson, formerly of the Mask and 
Wig Club of the University of Pennsylvania, was 
the one best qualified to coach the play. He saw two 
rehearsals of the selected play, and concluded that 
in the time left (four weeks) it could not be done

justice, and that he knew of one that he was sure 
the men could learn and have properly prepared in 
the remaining time. By a vote of the men then se
lected to play The Title Mart, the suggestion was 
put into operation at once; the manuscript in Phila
delphia telegraphed for and within two days rehear
sals were in progress once more. By working night 
and day from that time on, the initial production of 
the White Friars was put on the stage. Financial 
difficulties arose, and were met by the sale of ex
change tickets, 2of the amount expended was 
borrowed and that for two weeks from one of the 
faculty, as was shown by the report given at the last 
meeting.

The Tartan hopes to have the privilege of printing,

THE RONDEAU.
Last Saturday afternoon, the usual visitors to 
Schenley Park and the flower show were treated to 
a sight that for a short time threatened to rival the 
big shows mentioned, and all day was a very credit
able side attraction to them. Those passing in the 
vicinity of Tech were attracted to the School of 
Applied Design, by what appeared to be the complete 
and sudden insanity of everyone in it. The room 
was full of figures in shirt sleeves madly tearing 
around with large drawing boards having thereon, 
sheets of white paper. Every once in a while a win
dow would open and about a half dozen jump out 
with their boards and wave them around in the air 
for a while and then jump back in again. Students 
and Professors with bowls of color and ink and 
sponges were continually getting in each others way, 
and the floor could hardly be seen for paper and the 
remains of lunches. At about four oclock the speed 
of the excited room increased, and at five everything 
and everyone stopped all at once, left the room, and 
had a snake dance out in the street, and a wagon 
loaded with boxes was seen driving away from the 
back door. So much for the looks of the thing from 
without; heres what was going on inside:
The Architects were finishing up the problem that 
had to be on the wagon to be shipped to New York
at five Sunday afternoon. All of last week was given 
over to the work, except such classes as were held 
by members of the faculty of the School of Applied 
Science. As usual, lots to do developed at the last 
minute, and made it necessary to work until the small 
hours during the latter part of the week, in order 
to be able to finish on time. It was an exciting cli
max for the six long weeks of work, but another one 
starts next Saturday, so cheer up Architects, more 
is yet to come.

THE TA RTAN
HERE IT IS.
On the opposite page will be found a photographic 
reproduction of the much talked of McCreerys 
Window, which was exhibited in honor of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania Foot-ball Team during the 
week of its visit to Pittsburgh.
A. L. Boulfrois, whose ingenuity was responsible 
for the display in the first place, succeeded in get
ting hold of a suitable cut, and the opposite page 
shows that The Tartan did the rest.
The entire display measured 20 feet long by 11 
feet deep, with the playing field in the middle, con
sisting of a green billiard table cloth 10 feet long by
5 feet wide, ruled off to a scale in accordance with 
the official playing rules.
Tiny white Teddy Bears represented the various 
players on both teams, and each Teddy had a small 
Red and Blue or Scottish Plaid bow tied about his 
neck, according to the school, whose athletic honor 
he strove to uphold. A neat little name card at his 
feet told the onlooker just who he was and the posi
tion he boasted of.
The Skibos are shown lined up in the middle of 
the field, with Brown in the center ready to boot the 
ball to "Capt. Hollenback on the latters five-yard 
line.
Capt. Dowling and Billy Hittner are seen in 
the back field, ready for a return punt, or any other 
surprise that might present itself. Directly over 
the kickoff mound is a regulation foot-ball, which 
forms the center of numerous ribbons, extending ac
cording to their color over the right and left of the 
field. The rooters stands are not the least interest
ing part of the display, for Cheer Leader Dornberger can be plainly seen on the one side, leading his 
band of yelling Scotch Techites, and the Red and 
Blue man conducting a similar operation on the 
other. Above each stand on a small placard printed 
in the proper colors, the close observer can see ex
actly what they were shouting.
Through the courtesy of Director Arthur Arton 
Hamerschlag the large Scottish Tartan which was 
presented to the Carnegie Technical Schools by An
drew Carnegie at the time of its founding, was 
drawn from its sacred hiding place and exhibited to 
public view for the first time. It can be plainly 
seen, proudly flaunting its C. T. S.
The latest picture of Coach Bill Knoxs squad is 
seen directly below the Tartan, and Sol Metzgar 
with his sturdy bunch of Red and Blue warriors, oc
cupy a similar position at the opposite end.
The color scheme is most minutely carried out. 
And, taken altogether, it not only formed a very 
unique display, causing much favorable comment, 
but gave the citys civil guardians no end of trouble 
keeping the continuously blocked sidewalk partly 
clear.
Writing paper with the Tech Monogram, plain or
in colors, can be had from Johnson, Soph Elect., or
Mitchell, Soph. Mining, for 50 cents per quire.
DAY INDUSTRIALS.

The way in which the Industrials walloped the 
U. of P. Medicals at Exposition Park, Saturday 
morning, should be a source of gratification to the 
whole school as well as to the Industrials. The 
game was called at 10 o'clock, Hamilton, of Medicals, 
kicking off to White, who returned the ball thirty 
yards before being downed. By a series jf end runs 
and line plunges the ball was carried to the Medi
cals five-yard line and White went ove^ with the 
ball for the first touchdown, in three minutes from 
the time the game started. Hamilton kicked to 
Rogers, who returned the ball fifteen yards. The 
ball was again brought to Medicals' seven-yard line, 
where they secured the ball on downs, this being 
their first time to get possession of the ball. Medi
cals immediately kicked to Rogers, who returned 
the ball fifteen yards. Walton went around the 
end for another fifteen yards and the second touch
down.
The rest of the first half was played in Medicals 
territory, the Industrials securing two more touch
downs.
In the second half Rugh went over for a touch
down in two minutets after the kickoff.
The Medicals now took a brace, but Industrials 
scored another touchdown, just to show them how 
easy it could be done.
The features of the game were the end runs and 
line plunges by Rugh, Walton, White and Crawford.

The only unpleasantness of the aftermath of the 
Tech-Pittsburg game last Tuesday, comes in a backhanded way from the Pittsburg Press. It is not 
our intention to quote from the three articles in 
question, but to set any of the student body who 
may have read them, right as to their meaning and 
purpose.
In the first place, the Pittsburg Press is, with 
possibly one exception, the poorest apology for 
everything clean, manly and decent in the journalis
tic field of Greater Pittsburg. It is a disgrace to a 
civilized community, and its glaring six-inch red 
headlines are a source of constant offence to thinking 
people. It suits the class that patronize it, for fail
ing to have the support of the higher classes, it 
caters to the scandal mongers and divorce trial 
readers. To have such a yellow sheet with the 
name Pittsburg on it sent to other cities is bad 
enough, but when it takes with it a series of flip 
comments on our foot-ball players, coaches, and the 
team in general, it is infinitely worse. The people in 
the other cities are not apt to know what we do 
about the Press, and it is a fact that many things 
are accepted as facts simply because they were in 
the paper. Who put them in and why, could not 
in this case be considered, and the proper discount 
made.
The articles referred to themselves, imply that 
members of our foot-ball team are cowtirds; that 
they have been four flushing about their ability, and 
that Tech generally, is run by a set of incompetent 
kids. The underhanded slurs at the team, display 
the caliber of the writer and the editorial force of the 
paper that let them thru. The denial usually made 
in such a case is by no means sufficient. The stu
dent body of Tech has a right to know the kind of a 
paper making the remarks, and to place that knowl
edge in their hands, is the only purpose of this ar
ticle. Their purpose can only be guessed at, but it 
is certainly consistent with that governing their atti
tude towrard other news items. Pretty strong? Not at 
all. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburg has i complete 
file of back copies and they are records of past his
tory. The periods covering some famous divorce 
trials and other scandals (made famous by the 
Press and others of its level) makes rather racy 
reading, all of it featured, of course.
It is not likely, however, that any harm has been 
done, for the class of people accepting anything of 
that nature from such a sheet, are not the ones who 
give the Schools their support.
Copies of this edition of The Tartan with this 
article marked with blue pencil have been mailed to 
the editors of the Press.
We are sorry to hear that Patterson has had the 
misfortune to lose his father.
The Crucible Club held its bi-weekly meeting last 
Friday evening. Thomson gave a vivid description 
of climbing down a mine shaft with a stick of dyna
mite in his teeth. The Crucible Club got some val
uable information ( ?) and Thomson got pome prac
tice that will come in handy when he runs for Con

WHY HE LOST HIS FRIENDS.AN ULTIMATUM.
He was always wounding their feelings, making 
sarcastic or funny remarks at their expense.
He was cold and reserved in his manner, cranky, 
gloomy, pessimistic.
He was suspicious of everybody.
He never threw the doors of his heart wide open 
to people, or took them into his confidence.
He was always ready to receive assistance from 
them, but always too busy or too stingy to assist 
them in their time of need.
He regarded friendship as a luxury to be enjoyed, 
instead of an opportunity for service.
He never learned that implicit, generous trust is 
the very foundation stone of friendship.
He never thought it worth while to spend time in 
keeping up his friendships.
He did not realize that friendship will not thrive 
on sentiment alone; that there must be service to 
nourish it.
He did not know the value of thoughtfulness in 
little things.
He borrowed money from them.
He was not loyal to them.
He never hesitated to sacrifice their reputation for 
his advantage.
He was always saying mean things about them in 
their absence.
He measured them by their ability to advance 
him.Success.
You have treated me badly, though madly 
Ive loved you for nearly a year.
Youve been turning me down with your ugliest 
frown.
And Im growing discouraged, I fear.
You may think it amusing, refusing 
The offers Ive made of my hand 
Ive been patient and meek, but at last I must 
speak
It is more than a fellow can stand.
It is hard to be doing this wooing 
' So long when you never respond;
When the chance is so small youll be in when I call 
It is hard to be faithful and fond;
When you yawn through my visit, now is il 
A thing that a fellow would like?
You must make up your mind pretty soon to be kind 
O, I give you fair warning, Ill strike.
Its a strain on affection; rejection 
And snubbings not easy to bear.
When with others you flirt my best feelings are hurt.
It seems almost a hopeless affair.
It has spoiled my good humor, this rumor;
I cant say that I like it a bit.
If its true youre engaged I shall be so enraged 
That I really believe I shall quit.

SENIOR DRESSMAKING.
The work this year in the Dressmaking department 
is exceedingly interesting. During the first few 
weeks of school, we made crinoline models of beauti
ful gowns and coat suits. This gave us much val
uable experience both in cutting and fitting. Special 
emphasis was laid on the sleeves, for as every one 
knows, upon these depend the smart and up-to-date 
appearance of a gown.
The work in the Costume Design Class is very 
closely related to that in the dressmaking since it is 
here that we plan and work out the designs of the 
gowns we make. One day the class visited the large 
department stores downtown and examined the 
gowns displayed. Some of these gowns we sketched, 
and from these rough sketches afterwards worked 
out designs for the afternoon gowns we are making 
at the present time. The making of princess slips 
for these gowns brings back recollections of the 
trying times we had last year when making fitte^ 
linings. But that is only one phase of dressmaking, 
and so our thoughts quickly turn to the more agree
able part of the work, such as the designing and 
trimming of waists and gowns.
The fine hand-sewing and embroidery are some of 
the more delightful parts of our work, also. Every 
girl who is fond of the needle, at all, delights in the 
dainty things to which embroidery and fine needle
work can be applied. Besides the regular embroid
ery stitches, we learn all the fancy stitches that can 
be used in the decoration of gowns, and the mys
teries of hand-made trimmings.
Our special delight is the millinery class This is 
simply a short course in home millinery, including 
both making and trimming, as well as designing and 
renovating. The girls of both Dressmaking and Cos
tume Design classes are very enthusiastic over the 
work and display with much pride the hats they 
have trimmed. Watch the Seniors some day as they 
file out of the building and see if you cant tell the 
milliners by the way they carry their h* ads. You 
can tell them by their hats, anywayfor of course 
none of the other girls can aspire to anything as 
stylish and distinctive as our headgear. We feel 
that the work of our course is especially attractive 
and pleasant, at the same time being thoroughly 
practical and technical. Next year it will be more 
practical still.
According to the fashion,
Plaited skirts we made
And then, as if it was a rule,
All other styles aside we laid.
But now' Dame Fashions mood has changed,
Directoire is her pass word
And she who still to plaits inclines
Must change to gores and long straight lines!
Much laughter was heard the other day coming 
from the direction of the English room. It can be 
easily explained. One of the girls, in expounding the 
meaning of a certain line of poetry, said, Her com
plexion is compared to a summer day, because it is 
so hot!
The Dramatic Club held its election on Wednesday 
of last week, and the following officers were chosen:
Chairman...............................Nancy Herron (Sr.)
Sec.-Treas....................Gertrude Hartman (Jr.)
Business Manager.........Martha Bovard (Sr.)
Librarian............ ......................Olive Freese (Jr.)
Diana of the Directoire.
Bring me my new fall hat, mamma, for 1 want to 
put it on
It is wider than the widest hats we wore in years 
agone.
It is three feet wide and the brim is thick, and it has 
a lot of weight,
And it makes me wear three heads of hair just to 
keep it sitting straight.
My shoes? Ah, yes, I have put them on, and the 
heels are good and high,
And they press against my tender feet till I feel that
I must die;
Yet I wear them so, as I come and go, and I force a 
pleasant smile
For one has to be in style, mamma,one has to be 
in style.
And now my directoire gown, mamma; Ive managed 
to don my stays;
You will have to slip me into it for my arms I cannot 
raise,
And Im willowy as you may see, with the willowness 
of steel
It will be to-night ere I take a bite for I cannot hold 
a meal!
And now I go for a little stroll, and I go to make a 
call
And I shall not sit upon a chair, but shall lean 
against the wall,
For I cant sit down in my nice new gown, for I 
know that if I do 
I'll be certain to break in two, mamma, Ill certainly 
break in two!
Chicago Post.
We had a great treat last week listening to Capt. 
Jack Crawford, the poet scout, spin yarns and recite 
his own verses. For nearly an hour he talked, and 
kept us shrieking with laughter most of the time. 
In speaking of his own school days, he said, 1 never 
had anything but trouble while I was going to school 
never anything but trouble. I only went four days 
and got licked every day! And I thought if they

---------------------------------------------------

I^a I4<I49II
kept on like that theyd soon have me killed, so I 
quit; for I'd rather be a live ignoramus than a dead 
scholar, any day! His verses all smack of western 
plains and broncho busting but are nevertheless full 
of beautiful sentiment and that kind of humor which 
is so nearly akin to pathos. The little poem entitled 
"God Has Lots of Sunshine, would be a good one 
for us all to learn. Capt. Jack talked his way 
into our hearts in just about two minutes, and the 
only fault we had to find with his talk was that it 
was not half long enough. And surely, if it is true 
that laughter is better than medicine, none 01 us will 
have any drug bills to pay for some time. Capt. 
jack, we hope you will come again, soon.
Did you notice how sad certain of the girls looked 
when they returned to school last Wednesday morn
ing? , One of them confessed that she sat up all 
night with her ear glued to the receiver of the tele
phone! Whats the use of mourning, girls?He 
is not dead, but sleeping.
An Ode to Dear Teacher.
Poor little Miss Bradt 
In the lunch room is caught 
With benighted young ladies,
Who wish to be taught
How to cook, and to serve
Meals to hungry young girls
How to manage, and finance,
And make the books balance.
So eager are they 
For the lessons they learn 
That they rush to the school 
Every day or wet morn.
Now let us all hope 
That Miss Bradt can this stand 
Until all these fair maidens 
Are out of her hands.
A number of the girls witnessed the foot-ball game 
on election day between Pitt and Tech. After the 
splendid showing made against Penn on Saturday, 
hoped the team would be able to score on Pitt. Of 
course, we are sorry that they didn't, but we are not 
disappointed in the team. We wish the boys to know 
that we are proud of ihe clean and plucky game they 
play, and that we are ready to do our part of the 
cheering whether they win or lose.
Miss Harding (in History)What kind of books 
were found in the Library Temple in Nipper?
Miss MaltbyAbout 20,000 prayer-books were

The Director took lunch in the House" on Thurs
day. The other guests were Mrs. Hamerschlag, 
Miss West, Miss Libby, of Princeton, and Miss Pen
dleton. The hostess was Miss Ellis, the maid, Miss 
Daugherty, and the cook, Miss Benner. This was 
the first time so large a party had been entertained, 
and of course there was quite a flutter in the class.
Mr. and xMrs. Virgil, of Virgil Clavier fame, visited 
the school on Friday. Mr. Virgil gave a short talk 
along musical lines, his text being, All reasonable 
difficulties can be overcome by reasonable effort. 
Mrs. Virgil illustrated his methods of acquiring cor
rect touch and technic, and then played several se
lections on the piano which were greatly enjoyed.
Through the kindness of Miss Harding, the girls of 
Morrison Hall were privileged to attend the Elmendorf lecture on Palestine Monday evening.
A pleasant story of Andrew Carnegie is told which 
shows that his generous spirit finds other ways of 
expressing itself, than by gifts of libraries and pipe 
organs and Tech schools.
At Skibo Castle,' Mr. Carnegie had during the 
summer a beautiful rose-garden. There Were thou
sands of red and white and yellow roses blooming 
there, and the villagers were free to saunter in the 
garden paths to their hearts content.
One day the head gardener waited upon Mr, Car
negie:
Sir, he said, I wish to lodge a complaint.
Well, said the master.
"Well, sir, began the gardener, I wish to inform 
you that the village folk are plucking roses in your 
garden. They are denuding your rose trees, sir.
Ah! said Mr. Carnegie, gently, my people are 
fond of flowers, are they, Donald? Then you must 
plant more.Selected.
A Song of Science.
(With apologies to Mother Goose.)

The girls begin to shout 
Oh, hurry up and shut the door 
Before my gas goes out.

Cooking things with smells.

While its disagreeable, it helps 
Our brains to devel-ope.

At the class meeting held last Friday, candidates 
for the various offices of the class organization were 
nominated and to all appearances the coming elec
tion will be as exciting as was the one which pul 
the present incumbents in power. Leety, W. B. MeCreery, Keagy, and Weber make up a gcod quartet 
from which to choose a president, and Helm, Car
penter, Neuman, Ricketts, and Joe McCreery a fine 
quintet from which his mate is to be taken. There 
are candidates and candidatesand more candidates 
for all the offices but that of Marshall. McCowen 
is hoping McCreery is elected and Joe is hoping 
Mac' is the fortunate (?) one.
Wayman was again chosen to represent the class 
on the school athletic board, Leety running him a 
close second, Wayman winning by only two votes. 
A letter tendering his resignation was received from 
Sample, our former secretary, and upon motion of 
Mr. Weber a vote of thanks for his past services and 
a reply accepting his resignation was sent to Mr. 
Sample in New York.
The foot-ball team has been re-organized and Hoff
man is now manager with Weber as captain. A game 
is looked for November 21st with the Avalon Ex 
High and the 1-913 squad will very likely be attended 
to Thanksgiving morning. The Plebes were chal
lenged to a game for November 14th, but up to this 
time they have not replied. Moran,- Lightner, Kline, 
and Syrinda are some new ones who have appeared 
for practice and are making good.
First it is 1911, then it is 1913, who take an almost 
witty fling at this class. To all of these 1912 pays but 
little heed, they looking with compassion and pity

to themselves as they peruse the free advertisements 
of their class, What fools those mortals be.

GLEE CLUB.
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs had a very success
ful practice Sunday afternoon, and Mr. Dorrington 
and Mr. Schneidlmeir were well satisfied with the 
way the men are working. The Glee Club is getting 
a good grip on the new songs, while quite a number 
of new players for the Mandolin Club have come out 
and have shown a disposition to pull in the right 
direction. From now on practice will be held every 
Sunday afternoon at Room 123 for the Glee Club and 
the Assembly Room for the Mandolin Club.
An impression seems to have spread that "Preps  
and Industrials are not eligible to membership in 
the clubs. This report has NO foundation. The 
only restrictions, other than musical ability, are 
that the man be a registered student in good stand
ing at Tech. Distinctions between the various divis
ions should not be allowed to interfere with the 
struggle to make our combined clubs of the highest 
standard, worthy of the schools they represent.
The Mandolin Club is in search of a new piano ac
companist, one who can modulate his touch to suit 
the occasion. The technique of the club has passed 
the stage where a continuous rumble is required.
1911NIGHT.
The social committee again reports delay in re
gard to the dance they are anxious to hoi.l with the 
M. M. C. S. night girls. While the postponement is 
indefinite, the boys may hope to enjoy a hop before 
long if brains and industry can bring it about.
Gumps of the Met. is taking treatment for weak

The following wras lately found on the black-board: 
Schrock, M.E., A.B., D.L. LD., etc. We are glad

W. J. Yenny, alias Dutch, has been appointed 
chairman of our athletic committee. He will rep
resent 1911 in all athletic questions and on the gen
eral committee drawn from the students for the 
adoption of an athletic constitution.

COMEDY OF THE LOCKER.
(SceneLocker Room.)
Plebe enters in big hurry, flashes to locker 50,117. 
(His locker is 50,116.) Inserts key. Turns key. 
Lock wont budge. Plebe looks surprised. Looks 
grieved. Trys again. Nothing doing. Plebe makes 
a few comments on lockers in general, and this locker 
in particular, grabs the door and shakes vigorously, 
after which he exhausts his vocabulary of real 
naughty swear words, and wants to kick himself be
cause he cant think of anything hot enough to fit 
the occasion. At this point the owner of locker 
50,117 enters and inquires what the blank-blankblank is being done to his locker.
Plebe (with sheepish grin)Oh-er-ah-is this your 
locker? Goes out and trys to kick a hole through a 
brick partition.

This game showed up the kind of material which our 
team is made of. Although outweighed, they were 
not outplayed at any time during the game. The fine 
playing of the ends was a remarkable feature of the 
game. Traver, although not completely recovered

Whispers of the banquet have been heard lately. 
Let us have a little more than whispers.
Gov.Stone was seen to play the gallant one day 
last week. The wind accidentally on purpose blew 
a young ladys hat over on the grass by the library. 
Stone made a flying tackle at the hat, returned it to 
its owner and then, in response to Fattys commands 
to stay off the grass, hit the trail to school at a 2:40 
gait. His name has been sent to the Carnegie Hero 
Commission.
In Mechanical drawing the other day Mr. Yates 
seemed to think that something on a students 
paper needed to be erased. There came near being 
an awful mess as, instead of pickitig up an eraser, he 
picked up another fellows tobie instead.
It is earnestly hoped that the students may derive 
a great deal of good from Dr. Johnsons lecture last 
Wednesday. There is nothing new under the sun.

The button committee are doing some tall hustling 
with respect to the class buttons and expect to have 
the buttons ready shortly.
Last Saturday the Freshmen team played Bellevue 
High School at Bellevue. The opposing teams were 
about even matched with respect to weight. Owing 
to the costly fumbling on the part of our team we 
we were only able to score two touchdowns to their 
one. Traver, Mullen, Bradley and Crowell gave a 
very good account of themselves in the game. The 
score wasFreshmen 11, Bellevue H. S. 6.
