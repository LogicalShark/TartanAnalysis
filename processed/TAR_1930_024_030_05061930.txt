Freshmen Y. M. C. A. 
Cabinet Plans For 
Summer Convention
At a meeting held by the Fresh
man Y. M. C. A. Cabinet last 
Tuesday, April 29, Mr. Davis, secre
tary of the Carnegie Tecih Y. M. 
C. A., announced that probably 
enough monejr would be donated 
by the different churches about the 
school to send several delegates 
from the Freshman Cabinet to the 
Y. M. C. A.-Y. W. C. A. Student 
and Faculty Convention to be held 
at Forest Park, Pennsylvania, on 
June 11 to 21, 1930. Several mem
bers of the Cabinet signified that 
they desired to attend the conven
tion. The convention will last for 
two weeks, and during that time 
lectures will be given and sessions 
held for the purpose of instruct
ing the delegates about religion 
and Y. M. C. A. work.
Mr. Davis followed the announce
ment about the convention with 
several others which had VO do 
with plans for the work of the 
Cabinet next year. It is planned 
to let the present Freshman Cabinet, 
with practically the same person
nel, continue next year as a Sopho
more Cabinet. A new Freshman 
Cabinet will then be created after 
the beginning of the second semes
ter. If the plan works the mem
bers of the Sophomore Cabinet will 
become members of the Senior 
Cabinet in their junior year. Each 
member of the Sophomoic Cabinet 
will, be on otic or more commit
tees of the Senior Cabinet, and 
thus each will become familiar with 
the work of the Senior Cabinet. 
Mr. Davis lioftes that by such a 
plan the Carnegie Tech Y. M. C. A. 
Iiembers will become a more unified 
roup.
A tentative date has been set

ond; New Records Set 
in Both Track and 
Field Events
Scott High schools well-balanc
ed track team romped away will! 
highest honors in Carnegie's four
teenth annual track and field meet. 
The Victorious Red team of To
ledo, Ohio, placed iii ten of thir
teen (jvents, which enabled them to 
score 15 more points than Salsm 
High school, also of Ohio, v. ho 
proved to be their nearest rival's. 
Scott was also successful in win
ning the mile relay in the Class A 
division with the exceptional time 
of 3:39. Ellwood' City, Corincllsviiie, and Clairtoh were winners' in 
their particular sc'ctioris for' the 
same relay.
Bdhlinder of Grove City out
stepped the others to win the hun
dred yard dash in the record break
ing time of 10 seconds. Johnny 
Jacobs of Schenley ran a  very 
pretty race to finish second, but 
the Grove City ace broke the tape 
as the Pittsburgh boy made an <:!- 
fort to pass him. Fleming of We 
inghoiisc and Burg win of Steuben
ville showed their backs to the rest 
of the entries in the 220-yard 
event which the former won with 
a time of 23:1 seconds.
Stearns annexed the quarter mile 
race for Steubenville by crossing 
the tape in a little less -than 54 
seconds.. The half mile run prov
ed to be a thriller in which Dun
can of Conncllsvillc, McMurdo of 
Ellwood City, and Walk'cr of Salem 
finished in that order; 2:07 was the 
best time for this distance. In the 
mile, 'Walker ' of Salem took the 
lead before the-first lap -had been 
completed and succeeded in hold
ing it for. the balance of the race, 
His time of . 4:45 approaches the 
record for this event, which was 
set last year.

playing in the Unjori on both .nights.
In the Gymnasium, the celebrated 
Sylvanians orchestra, lead ,by Burt 
Wcidcniiamcr will furnish the dancc 
music for the Highland Fling, as 
for the other two dances. This 11-

in order to create a Scotch atmosT 
phcrc for. the Highland Fling, it , is 
requested that all. men who are able

Welding Society 
Elects Gurley 
President
Last Tuesday evening the local 
section of the American Welding 
Engineers Society held a meeting 
in the Carnegie Union. About 300 
members were present. The meet
ing was in charge of William W. 
Reddie of Westinghouse Electric. 
Mr. Reddie is the retiring chair
man. Officers for the coming year 
were elected. They are: Leroy
Gurley, chairman; Edward Quinin 
of Jones and Laughlin, vice chair
man, and Joseph Minnotte, secre
tary and treasurer. Mr. Gurley is 
also editor of the magazine Weld
ing.
At the meeting two sound pic
tures were exhibited by the Gen
eral Electric Company. The first 
described a new seven-mile rail
road tunnel through the Rocky . 
Mountains, eliminating many miles 
of snow, and curves. The picture 
of most interest, however, was 
"The Hottest Flame in the World, 
featuring Dr. Irving Langmuir, who 
spoke on and demonstrated the 
use of the atomic hydrogen weld
ing flame. This flame was developed 
while working on the manufacture 
of tungsten filaments for use in 
electric light bulbs. Due to the 
very high melting point of tungsten, 
the only way in which to manu
facture tungsten wire had been to 
enclose the metal in an atmos
phere of hydrogen and pass a very 
heavy current through the tungsten. 
In the development of this process, 
it occurred to Dr. Langmuir that 
it might be interesting to study the 
heat losses from the heated tung
sten wire. He found that if the 
wire were in an atmosphere of 
nitrogen the heat loss was a steady 
and gradual upward curve to the 
highest temperature recorded, about 
4,000 degrees Centigrade. However 
with an atmosphere of hydrogen

Skills and Satisfaction1 
Was Subject of Lecture 
Last TuesdayALUMNI
FEDERATION
On Tuesday of last week Mar
garet Morrison Assembly was ad
dressed by Dr. Lillian Gilbreath, 
prominent engineer from Mont 
Clair, New Jersey. Mrs. Gilbreath 
is an outstanding example of a 
successful 'combination of marriage 
and a career, for in addition to 
her professional work and the 
writing of several ooks, she is the 
mother of a large family.
Mrs. Gilbreath and her husband, 
the late Frank Gilbreath, together 
worked out a system of Time and 
Motion Study in Industry. Since 
her husband's death Mrs. Gilbreath 
has continued the work alone, 
maintaining a laboratory in Mont 
Clair to which students in the 
field of engineering return for new 
ideas on efficiency methods. She 
has also made lecture tours all over the world.
In her address here on Tuesday, 
Dr. Gilbreath spoke on "Skills and 
Satisfaction. Her theme was that 
to be truly educated, intellectual 
attainments alone are not suffi
cient, b.uty should be supplement
ed by the ability to do something 
skillfully with the hands.
After the assembly, Dr. Gilbreath 
was entertained at lunchcon in 
the Margaret Morrison dining 
room by Miss Harriet F. Glcndon, 
head of the Household Economic Department.

TRACK NUMBER OF 
PUPPET OUT TODAY
The new Track Number of the 
Carnegie Puppet is placed on the 
campus for sale today. This issue 
represents the first efforts of the 
new staff which has -made a num
ber of progressive changes in the 
magazine.The number deals essentially with 
track, but in addition to the usual 
type of humorous material which 
appears in the magazine there arc 
a number of special features.
"Tank" Ashe has cleverly char
acterized the leading lights of the 
track team with his pen and brush. 
The inside dope on the Intra-mural 
and varsity track meets is brought 
to the surface;Then there is the usual Greek 
Gossip which will continue to aggrcvatc those who need aggrevating and an article entitled Why a 
Faculty at Carnegie?" which will 
no doubt bring down severe crit
icism from the leading educators 
of our times.The Carnival is given considerable, 
space, and several other features 
besides poems, book reviews, and 
the wit of exchanges fill up the 
biggest Puppet of the year. Get

sold out before Campus Week

INTER-NIGHT COLLEGE DANCE
TO BE HELD MAY 10
At last the Exams, arc over, and 
you can just bet that J am glad. 1 
suppose I have company, now don't 
all say so at onceone at a time, 
please. Every place 1 looked I saw 
night students cramming for the 
Exams. It surely was a wonderful 
passtimc for those energetic mortals 
who wanted to gel it over with, and 
the others, well they just dont have 
a place at Carnegie, at least that is 
my observation. Some school, they 
ccrtainly don't fool with you here. 
You just make the grade, or else.
1 am glad to note in last weeks 
Plaid the reason for the change of 
date o the Inter-Night College dance. 
This had me sorta worried, because 
the Handbook said May 9, and a 
notice in 'the school paper gave the 
date as May 10. You have to hand 
it to those members o the Night 
Student Council. They certainly put 
things over with a bang, and 1 dont 
mean maybe. 1 suppose, or at least 
take it for granted, that the Gym
nasium will be dressed up in fitting 
style for the affair. 1 am going to 
be there and see for myself.
Shush! I found a paper towel 
again, and I immediately started to 
use it. 1 am sorry I took the last 
one, but if I didnt some one else 
would and then they would be the 
last to use it; However, better times 
arc coming, and we hope that we will 
have more of these necessary articles 
to help clean up Pittsburgh, even if 
it is a dirty city.The Architects were at a Charclt 
again, or at least that is what the 
Plaid read. Wonder how it feels to 
be on the "little cart" or how long 
it takes them to reach the sludjo? 
This would be a problem for the. 
Engineers to figure out on their 
slip stick. Those Night Architects 
ccrtainly are made of the stuff that 
makes you stick. 1 have seen them 
out till the wee hours of the morn
ing rendering and stewing over a 
problem, and at the last minute pro
duce a wonderful lay-out for a 
library, a building, a dance hall, an 
activities buildingAh I there we have 
it. Otir Activities Building. Wouldnt 
this be a line Charett to get on. 
Let's see if we cant have one some 
day. At all events congratulations 
Sansonctti, Hoover, and Bown, who
ever you arc.From the liucup 1 notice every 
evening at the Registrar's Office, .1 
am sure there will he a large atlendance for the supplementary night 
term. This week J see Will lie the 
last opportunity to register, and if 
you have a mind to do no, you bet
ter attend to it at once. I have de
cided to take more punishment and 
am returning for one of the courses,
I like company, and 1 hope there 
will be more in my class so that we 
will enjoy the few remaining sum
mer evenings together.

The civilization in which wi live 
is to a great extent the product of 
the efforts of technical and scientific 
workers. The unprecedented develop
ment of wealth during the past hun
dred years which |ias culminated in
to the present period of enormous 
engineering construction and machine 
production is the result of engineer
ing ingenuity. The engineer and 
scientist Have gone far in their 'art 
of organizing and directing and ontrolling the forces and materials of 
nature.
But I am not so certain .bat al 
this has been "for the benefit of the 
human race. For back of our mag
nificent cities and vast industries 
there stii,! lies the black shadow of 
proverty. " During an era of prosper
ity we behold widespread unemploy
ment. As we. gaze on the wants of 
men, we are informed that there is 
an 'ovcr-pfoduction of goods. Al
though men possess sufficient knowl
edge to immcasureably advance his 
social welfare, the}' lie bound with 
primitive beliefs which prevent the 
realization of richer life.
Mans destiny is t':c attainment of 
the fullest expression of his ability 
to think, his capacity for love, his 
power to will. These are peculiarly 
human qualities and a good society 
would be one in which the struggle 
for food had been pushed into the 
background and mans upward urge 
towards a perfect life given full play.
But, instead of a civilization in 
which all men join hands for es
tablishing human dominion over 
nature through the release of scien
tific and creative activity, we see a 
small group in possession of the 
wealth of the world while the great 
mass of men swarm around them in
James SI. Sansonetti 
Re-elected President Of 
Night Student Council
At a recent meeting of the Night 
Student Council Mr. James H. .San
sonctti was re-elected to succeed him
self as president of that organiza
tion. It was a fitting tribute to his 
work of , the past year that the 
Council should elect him to the office 
for another term by an unanimous 
vole. Since  Council has been in 
existence there have been occasions 
of other officers being re-elected to 
office but this action in the case of 
the president is without precedent.
Mr. Sansonctti has always main
tained that a student can keep up 
with his studies and at the same time 
take an active part in the student 
activities of the school. This cannot 
be any better exemplified than the 
fact that during the past three years 
when lie served on the Night Stu
dent Council as treasurer and presi
dent respectively, lie always had high 
marks on his architectural problems 
and on his final probjem for this 
year lie received one of, the highest 
marks given at night.
The Plaid wishes him success and 
with the support of the student 
body lie will accomplish very much 
of benefit to the night students.

Still Time to Contribute
a desperate struggle to gain 1 lie per
mission to live, And all the wealth 
of Ibis great swirling whirlpool of 
hunVanity gravitates to the vortex and 
is swallowed by the insatiable maw 
of private ownership. Mankind ex
hausts itseltj in the struggle and life 
is drained of its value.
The labors of the engineer slide 
down the same funnel. Ot what 
benefit is it to society that an engine
er should design a machine to save 
the labor of a hundred men, if the 
machine only secures to private 
ownership greater security in tin; ex
ploitation of mankind? So long as 
the engineer must remain obedient to 
a small group who control the re
sources of the earth for personal 
aggrandizement, so long will lie . be 
hindered by their desires and am
bitions from the full attainment of 
his value lo society. Stuart Chase, 
in his interesting book "Prosperity, 
Fact or Myth, closes with these 
pertinent paragraphs:
"Above all, the technician is undone 
by failure to inaugurate a national 
system of supcr-managcment, whereby 
production might be articulated to 
consumptive needs, and the Jabulous 
wastes of excess plants, cxccss over
head costs, uneconomically located in
dustries, cross hauling, jam, tangle 
and bottlenecks, brought under ra
tional control. That such supermanagement is not beyond human 
capacity to operate, .the experiences 
of the Supreme Economic Council 
during the War, and of the Russian 
Gosplan today, amply demonstrate. 
What a lordiy science of cngineeriiig we might have, and to what 
great human benefit,  if industrial 
anarchy gave way to industrial co
ordination and socialization in those 
fields where it logically belongs.
Prosperity in any. deeper sense 
awaits the liberation of the engineer. 
If the owners will not get off his 
backand why should they; they pay 
him little enough and he fills their 
safe deposit boxes?I, for one, 
would not be sorry to sec him com
bine with the wayfaring man to lift 
them off. A complicated technical 
structure should be run by 'engineers, 
not hucksters. But the technician is 
the modern Prometheus, in'chains."
Is it not time that!* 'Prometheus 
should concern himself Rediscover the 
means of loosening his chains?

During the past week the cam
paign for collecting contributions 
to the Endowment Fund traveled 
along in great style. A represen
tativeof the Night Student Coun
cil was stationed at the key win
dow and made an appeal to each 
student as lie turned in his key. 
Scores of . students donated their 
dollar locker key deposit to be 
applied towards the Student Ac
tivities Building project, a much 
needed addition to our campus 
and the reason for which the Night 
Student Council is sponsoring this 
campaign.
Although the regular night term 
of school is over, there is still the 
opportunity for those taking sup
plementary courscs to contribute 
to this fund. If you care to do
nate when you relinquish your key, 
ask the man at the key window 
to give you an Endowment slip to 
sign. For the benefit of those who 
want to turn their key in now, 
the key room will be open Wed
nesday and Friday evenings of this 
week.
There arc many night students 
who do not have lockers and sev
eral of this, group have snown 
their interest in another wayby 
contributing a dollar in cash. This 
is a suggestion to. a.ll who did not 
have lccys to do their, bit in help
ing the N. S. C. make this cam
paign a big success.
If you have already signed a 
slip, dont forget that you, must 
turn your key in at the key win
dow or the dollar is lost so far as 
the Endowment Fund is concerned.
Your check or cash sent to the 
Night Student Council, Box 137, U 
I. T. Post Office, will .be applied 
to the fund. If yours is a cash 
contribution, dont forget your

Great Smoky Mountains.
The actual working of this project involved the erection of a constant

to 16,000 feet . . . three penstock 
tunnels 600 feet in length ... a verti

and a surge tank shaft.
From the Watcrvillc Development, 
transmission lines carry the current 
to many points in Carolina and 
Tennessee. The tremendous power 
of the Great Smokies serves to turn
the wheels of industry and light the 
homes of thousands of people of the 
South.
Sucli a development would not 
have been possible without the use of 
dynamite. Du Pont explosives were 
used for all blasting operations.

There is a lot of adventure in the 
editors days work sometimes. 
For example, this incident at a 
Southern coal mine where con
vict labor was then employed ex
clusively. A McGraw-Hill editor 
had gone down the shaft to get a 
story, to investigate some new 
processes that were being used.
McGraw-Hill editors are not out 
seeking thrills. Their job is to 
cover the field, to know what is 
going on, to be where things are 
happening, to see the right men, 
to get the news, to study every 
important development and trend. 
They must be ... they are ... the 
eyes and ears of the readers and 
must bring to them the everchanging picture of modern in
dustry and business.
That is why McGraw-Hill Publi

and industrial world today. That 
is why they are playing such an

You who are about to step out

You can do so by reading the

AS THE WEEKS ROLL BY, the days seem to become 
jammed with activities. This week finds the Carnegie student 
body bowed down and burdened with two track meets, three 
tennis matches, sweepstakes, county fair, dancesyes, three of 
them, and examinations will b;e given to the Sophomores to 
enable the Pennsylvania Society' for the Advancement of Teach
ing to ascertain just why we; are so dumb. Just why the 
Society should pick on the poor unsuspecting class of 32 is 
more than we know,but they did.
It has been ably suggested that during the period of these 
exams that the Varsity Cheer Leaders should be engaged to 
lend moral support to classes undergoing this particular form 
of recreation; perhaps some yelling would p.ut. the affair more 
on a competitive basis, and we would be sure to win' first honors 
in three exams if we .had such, opponents as Pitt or W. & J.*; * . ; * *' *
THE CARNEGIE CAMPUS FAIRLY seethed with activ
ity last Saturday when C. I. T. played host to some 1000 high 
pehool - athletes from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. 
This, the Fourteenth Annual Interscholastic meet, produced 
three new records.Bradley, timber topper from Connellsville, set a new record 
for the high hurdles with a time of 16.5; seconds. Bohlender, of 
Grove City, flashed down the 100-yard, straightway in the much 
discussed time of 10 seconds, and this time it really was just 
10 and no fractions of a second. Glic.kert of Toledo Scott, was 
the third performer to-break a meet record, thisnew -mark-being 
in the high jump division, and the markoh, yes, 6 feet, 
inches.The boy that the whole, schoof is. talking about is not any 
of the aforementioned stars. Two weeks ago Johnny Jacobs, ol 
the Finkelpearl Apartments, corner, of Forbes and Woodlawn, 
decided that he. would like to compete .in the 100-yard dash 
event for Schenley High. His first competitive run was clocked 
in 11.5, his second race in 10.8, and Saturday he finished a close 
second to Bradley, in the record-breaking century sprint. This 
is really remarkable when you know that Jack is but a soph
omore in high school, and we take this means of congratulating 
him. 1 "* * * * *
THE GAMBOLOF THE GREEKS HELD forth last 
Mo'nday and Tuesday in the Bowl, but instead of laurel wreaths 
to the victors, the reward of'Ye Mod erne Greeks was a silver 
loving cup and the smiles 6f approval from the charming co-eds 
of the . campus. The Betas came out on the-long end of the 
score, and not so very long at that, for their 31 did not loom 
so large when compared to the count of 21 rung up by the 
S. A. Es. .Tom Coulter, running under Betacolors, was the individual 
high scorer of the affair. This follower of Mercury shows much 
promise and continued development will find him a welcome 
addition to varsity ranks next year.
The dark horse of the contest was. Chuck Ackcnheil of the 
>D U clan. Ackenheil followed closely on Coulters heels,, and 
he was largely responsible for the fine showing made by his 
eating club.
In the relay race the D Us were victorious, thereby ..annex
ing an oversized ash tray for their mantel in the not-so-far-off 
rushing season.

WELL, WELL, WELL1Our hopes came true. President, 
rather Coach, Borden P. Hoover's racqueteers went through the 
week victorious, winning the Proxy's gavel, and the Bisons hide. 
The varsity' would probably have purloined the Covenanters 
frock, but meterological .conditioiis-:w^e...set ..up;,which precipi
tated rain, and since our courts resemble the St. Mihiel battle 
grounds, the surface, as it was in part, a hole, would not dry in 
time for the match. Consequently the match was cancelled.
The encounter with the Red and Black warriors of W. & J. 
was the first outdoor test for the varsity htis season. After 
stumbling around in the singles events, the squad pulled to
gether in the doubles and snatched the match,, or should we 
say the gavel, out of the fire. The final score was' 4-3. .
Little diiiicutly was found in taking , over the Bisons of 
Bethany oh their home courts. Manager Bill,.Pfouts. returned 
..with many compliments for a certain Greek-Boarding House on

PLAID RACQUETEERS
TAKE TWO MATCHES
Carnegie launched a most suc
cessful attack on the tennis, honors, 
this past week by defeating two 
teams of a high calibre. The W. 
& J. netmen returned to their hovel 
with a 4 to 3 defeat, and later in 
the week our Plaid team won from 
Bethany, 6-1, on Bethany's home 
grounds.
Our small margin ovqy the Presi
dents is magnified when, wo con
sider our short period of outdoor 
training as compared with that of 
W. & J. The Bethany battle was 
marked by a better brand of ba 1 
batting. Here, Coach Hoovers men 
took the situation in hand, and a 
decisive victory was the result 
Wednesdays shower was just 
enough to spoil the grounds fjr 
the Geneva engagement, so they 
returned, none the worse.
Captain Ivambach and Hardie 
gave the best exhibition in the 
W. & J. match. However, both 
lost in three sets. 1 One more oi 
the singles went to the visitors, 
and the remaindor of the program, 
which included two singles and 
two doubles matchcs, was ours, 
f In extending their winnings* over 
Bethany, the varsity employed miclscason form. Playing with a 
badly wrenched knee', Kambacli" 
was unable to down liis-oppone.it. 
Bob Caffee brought down the V.on-- 
ors in defeating the Bisohs best, 
man. He swung the racket :n nnc 
form, and took little time in gain-' 
ing a decision. From his perform: 
ance we can draw the conclusion 
that pie goes very well with ten
nis. It seems that Bobs di*ii con
sists of pie a-la-modc, and wcrc 
sure the makers of such things in 
West Virginia arc profiting by he 
teams trip to Bethany.
Saturday at 3:30 the Varsity 
netmen will play their . annual 
match with the Alumni. Such old
er stars as Glaser, Hopper, Beatty 
and Schmcrtz. are expected toput 
in an appcarancc. Comparing1 rc-: 
suits, it looks as though tin*, bat

to be one of titular' charactcr. The 
match will take place across the

Plebe Track And Field Team Defeat Indiana Squad 73-32
Carnegie Techs Plebc track team 
swept through to its third decisive 
victory Saturday when they swamped 
the Indiana State Teachers' College 
73-32. The first year outfit captured 
nine of the twelve events while hand
ing the Red and White-one of tnc 
worst setbacks it has suffered in 
many seasons.
Tom Coulter, star, quarter miler, 
was elected captain of the squad just 
bctcri-e the meet. He shared scoring 
honors for the afternoon with Sig
mund, taking firsts in the quarter 
mile and high jump events as well as 
running a leg on the victorious relay 
team, while Sigmund captured the 
100, 220, and broad jump events.
Muschello was Indianas ace, ac
counting for two of their three 
first places and winning the shot-put 
and discus events. Grundy scored 
the other victory for the teachers 
when he hurled the javelin 136 feet.
Having won all their, meets to date 
by at least thirty points, the "lebes 
are pointing for an all-victory scason. But three dual meets remain 
on . the yearlings program. A meet 
with Shadyside Academy for the 
coining Friday at the Fox Chapel 
track, followed by the annual uvrct

Another Spring Carnival?
Since September James Ashwell and his com
mittee have labored incessently to secure for theCar
negie students a rejuvenation of the. historic Campus 
Week. As is known their efforts were rewarded in the 
form of the Spring Carnival, which is just as attrac
tive and as extensive as any of, its predecessors, the 
nine Campus Weeks. However, future Spring Carni
vals are not assured, in fact, it is extremely doubtful 
whether the administration will again make such a 
concession. If they do, it will be solely because of the 
students reaction during the latter part of this week.
As should be known, drinking is the major point 
in question. Not that the administration demands or 
expects that some two thousand students will be 
painfully sober for two days, but any excess, or any 
undesirable actions will unquestionably be the death 
lcnell of future spring functions. If you must raise 
questionable whoopee, at least be considerate of the 
school and of the other students. Remember, coming 
students will desire a Spring Carnival just as much as 
youtheir satisfaction depends on your commendable 
action in this test Spring Carnival. Any conspicuous 
offenders will be dealt with severely, by the committee, whether they appear on the dance floor or on the 
campus.We know that numerous students will take ad
vantage of the school celebration to perpetrate a longawaited private celebration. However, be a sport; go 
to the day functionsdo not, appear partially or 
wholly drunk. Do not join that small minority which 
cause's all the trouble. Be considerate and fair to 
those students who are following you.
L.
FRESHMEN Y. M. C. A.
(Conliiued from Page One) 
installation baiicjfrct will be held in 
tin: week of May 12, 1930. The 
officers for the Senior Cabinet for 
the coming year arc: Francis
Downs, president; John Horning* 
vice president, and Robert Klein, 
secretary. The oiTiccrs were elect
ed by post-card ballots sent out to 
a 11 members of the Carnegie Tech 
Y. M. C. A.
The possibilities of holding a 
Freshman Camp at Beaver during 
Freshman Week next year were 
discussed by the Cabinet. It was 
thought advisable to appoint sev
eral members of the Cabinet to 
serve on a committee of the Senior 
Cabinet to make tentative plans 
for such a camp. The. freshmen 
would probably spend a night in 
the camp after a corn roast, which 
would be held in the afternoon of 
the same day.
It was decided that two or three 
members of the Cabinet should 
serve on committees to arrange 
for next years Freshman Week, 
Chapel Programs, Y. M. C. A. 
Financial Campaign, Church Rela
tionships, Publicity, Student Con
ferences, Student Discussion 
Groups, . Club Rooms, and radio 
installation for sick students in 
hospitals.
The desirability of an Activities 
Building was discussed and also 
the desirability of having moving 
pictures in the chib room of Scobell 
Hall for the dormitory men.
STUDENT COUNCIL
Professor Baker Brownell of the 
department of sociology and liter
ature at Northwestern University is 
in favor of red Morris chairs for 
class rooms. He told one of his 
classes that he thought the back
aches should be taken out of a 
college education by building insti
tutions of higher learning with 
homelike atmosphere and easy 
chairs.
It is possible that the great bene
factors of humanity, the big stiicl 
and oil men, will devote their bil
lion dollar fortunes to comfortable 
upholstery in the future. Until 
they amass these fortunes, however, 
students will have to struggle 
along in the conventional class
room seats.
(Continued from Pace One) 
gineering' frdternity, and recom
mended its recognition. The mem
bers , of Mu Epsilon must be 
upper classmen and will be selected 
from the upper third of the class. 
In addition to thehigh scholarship 
requirement personality and an ap
parent. interest in the work ofthe 
department arc necessary. It is 
the desire of Mu Epsilon to be
come recognized by, and affiliated 
with, the National Honorary So
ciety for Mechanical Engineers. 
The recommendation of Mr. Becker 
was approved by Council, and the 
existence, of. Mu Epsilon acknowledged.
As chairman of the Elections 
Committee Mr. Maync .requested 
the authority to draw up a set of 
rules to . .govern future elections. 
This actioif was deemed necessary 
pwing to.' the, .fact that several ques
tions, having no precedent, arose 
at the last elections. Among these 
questions was the procedure to be 
followed" in case a petition was not 
received for an office. .Since several 
vacancies have occurred for this 
reason. tlfe formation of a set of 
rules was thought to be a wise 
action, and permission was granted 
Mr.. Mayne to formulate it.
Further business included the ap
pointment of the senior presidents 
in the several schools to appoint 
one of th'eir members to assist Mr. 
Davis in" handling the caps and 
gowns for commencement, a report 
on the distribution of the activities 
fee by Mr. Connelly, and the ap
proval of May 22 as a date, for a 
Freshman Tea dance.
Interviewed recently'by the Daily 
Princetonian, II. 1.. Mencken, edi
tor of the American Mercury, 
stated: "Probably the most valu
able thing the average young 
American gets out of a college edu
cation lies in the general feeling 
that it makes him somehow su
perior. This feeling opens doors 
to  him. Moreover, lie usually 
shares it himself, and is thus made 
happy,
The Student Council of the Uni
versity.'; of Nebraska recently pass
ed a resolution abolishing minor 
class officers. It was believed that 
true class spirit suffered when 
meetings were held for the sole 
purpose of electing petty class offi
cers whose duties were neg
ligible. J
The annual "Dance o the Dragons," 
known to the Carnegie Campus at

spite the fact that we were forced 
to listen to the ancient and bearded, 
far-framed, noted, jokes of one Willianj Koblcy Pfouts for three-fourths 
of the intermissions, we certainly 
had quite an evening, and judging 
from the actions of the rest of 
those fortunate to be there, they did, 
loo.
Naturally enough, there were 
numerous all-important figures on the 
local campus on hand to lend the 
dignity of their austere prcsencc to 
the affair. The first person, or 
rather, the first thing, we saw as 
we entered the door was the now 
memorable profile of the commercial 
Dodo boy. Miss Ruth Thomas, who 
first discovered the aforementioned 
profile, had the doubtful honor of 
being there with him.
A partial social list follows: First 
comes the irrepressible Imogcnc Schory 
trying her best to be happy with 
Charlie Sclsam. 1 Then comes James 
Aslnvell, the well-known Pansy of 
Delta Tau. (We hope the "Pansy 
succeeds in surmounting the heights 
and tliat 5052 Forbes street docs 
right by him when they have their 
annual formal.) Sally Beatty and 
Elsa Weber were there, both doing 
their best to dirty the white flannels 
of a certain campus kolymnist" 
and succeeding. Dick Dcvcrcll and 
H. Lloyd Bunker were the reasons. 
And, of course, there had to be lots 
of Senior Builders including Ray 
Poulscn, with Miss Ann Somcthingorothcr; Lou Buranski and President 
Page; Irving Francis Covcncy; Frank 
Robinson; cute little Wayne High; 
Jo Jo Snyder; and last, but not least, 
one Samuel Kabakov.
The presence o so many Builders 
might have augured ill for those Com
mercials present, but with the. blonde 
Harry Down Morris, backed up by 
Charlotte Ball-; Flop Morris (no 
relation) with the girl who says 
were too personal; Benedict Arnold; 
Floyd Collins; Jakic Carpay; Hy 
Levinson; Wallace Bicri; and the 
aforementioned Dodo all on hand 
to rally round the author, it is 
easily understood as to why the 
Builders kept in the background. Ana 
we almost forgot all about Joe 
llerbst, loo.
Others on hand were Mr. Powell 
and Miss Gloria Anastasia Kloos, 
who acuscd us of many things: Floy 
Sample and the much discussed Mr. 
Morrison; too many Civil Engineers 
including Doug Seeley and Co., Dave 
Tomer, Violet Murdoch and the Mrs., 
and Victor Leo Bohden; lven Owens; 
Doris Mather, who knows, just how 
to handle the one and only; that lit
tle funster Katharine Pali Ira of 
Wappingers Falls, wherever that is; 
Jack Horning who, despite various 
and sundry threats' about Senior 
Balls, was all over the floor; Eliza
beth Lucille Moore (call Hi 7731 after 
5:30); Torchy and 'ill; Pat Jacobs; 
.who left his big red "C at home, 
and Betty Rankin (these two 'did 
not whistle at each other once) ; 
Tommy Pratt, taking advantage of 
Senior architectural rights, and Billie 
Bair; A. A. Miller; and the Maine 
Stein Song.
All in all, the affair can surely be. 
considered a huge success and wc 
congratulate Chairman Becker. Our 
only wish is that wc sincerely hope 
that the number of paid admissions 
made il possible for the Dragdns lo 
get there free.? * *
Random shots and random thoughts. 
We wonder why Russ Loxtcrman's 
Buiek stood for so many hours in 
front of the Fort Pitt one night last 
week. Looks as though Emery Liitcli 
isnt the only one interested in the 
Benson case. Maybe this Tartan 
will reach Wellesley too.
Our fame is far reaching. Only 
last week, one of the more elderly 
ladies in our home town, an M. M. 
C. C. alumna told us of noticing this 
columnand just how good it was. 
Honest! When we told her wc wrote 
it, her opinion changed. The lady 
in question was Miss Helen Drill ot 
the class of 1918.
The rain is responsible for many 
things. In order to transport the bal
lots of the recent royalty campaign 
in safety from Engineering to Mar
garet Morrison, Ed Steiner led Miss 
Gertrude Novak and the other teller 
through the underground tunnel. The 
excuse is plausible, yet wc arent so 
sure.
The Prince is worried these days 
because the Phi Psi barbell artist bor
rowed his Aqua Velva before tak
ing the Milkmaid out last week. Take 
it on the chin, Prince, old man.
\7e cant say yet just who will be 
our campus queen, but wc arc sure 
of one thing. If Isabelle Warner is 
elected, Joe (Himself) Herbst will 
be Campus King', if the queen is 
Miss Morgan, we arent so positive, 
although we do have a fairly good 
idea, and if leky Sheppard is it, then 
thking will he none other than 
Thomas l ippert. But dont worry 
boys, even if you lose, you'll each 
he a Campus Prince, which isnt so 
bad. Speaking of princes, we wonder 
what kick the editor of this sheet 
can get from picking violets in 
Schcnlcy Park.
Dr. Ira Landrith, former presi
dent of Ward Belmont College, 
told co-eds at the University of Ar
kansas to use pipes instead of cig
arettes if they wish to be mas
culine.
The Ethics of Being a Gentleman
Customs varysavages eat with their fingers, the Chinese with chop sticks, Americans keep Thanksgiving Day, Germans number their streets up one side and down the othercustoms arc largely an outward manifestation of environment.
Ethical standards come from within. To be a gentleman is the natural outward manifestation from .within of a desire to be courteous. Being a gentleman is andthcr expression for unselfishness. To have this naturally within us;that iswithout thinking about it, is the chief characteristic of a gentleman. It has nothing to do with clothes, money, fashions or customs. Snobs, fools, egoists and all the rest of the long list, including gentleman arc, taken as individuals, the same the world over and what they are' comes naturally and spontaneously from within and is . ultimately reflected in face and voicc. A gentleman cannot be vulgar, neither can a vulgar man be a gentleman.
To smile, to make ones self agreeable, to sec the best in others, to forget ones self in others, ,to do this naturally and without effort, spells unselfishness. But to offend the eye, the ear, the  nose, ones feelings, in fact, to be a road-hog or any other kind of a hogspells selfishness and the whole picture is vulgar.
Mr. Gentlemen and Mr. Vulgar both unconsciously show what is within.
WELDING SOCIETY ELECTS 
(Continued from Page One)
the curve branched off sharply 
upward at 2,000 degrees Centigrade. 
The only reasonable explanation of 
this was that the enormous heat 
went to decompose hydrogen into 
the atomic state. Further experi
mentation proved this to be truc^ 
Reasoning from the well-known law 
of conservation of energy, this heat 
could be used for welding purposes 
because,. when atomic hydrogen 
goes to the molecular form the 
reaction is exothermic. That is, 
it gives off heat. After much 
work a torch was developed using 
the atomic hydrogen -flame. At the 
end of the torch are placed two 
tungsten clcctrodcs through which 
an elcctric current of high poten
tial was passed. Hydrogen under 
pressure was then blown past the 
electrodes which arc at a tempera
ture of about 2,000 degrees Centi
grade. This decomposes some of 
the hydrogen, and when the flame 
issues from the tube it is com
posed of two parts, a molecular 
hydrogen .exterior and an atomic 
hydrogen interior. The heat of 
combination, of hydrogen develops 
a temperature of about 4,000 de
grees' Centigrade which added to 
the heat of the flame due .to the 
electric arc makes a very high 
temperature indeed. The tempera
ture may be varied by using dif
ferent wattages for the electric 
arc, since it has been ascertained 
that the percentage of decomposed 
hydrogen varies in a direct ratio 
with the wattage.
The . reason the tungsten elec
trodes do not melt is because by 
blowing the hydrogen past the 
electrodes, the point o(. intense heat 
is developed some distance a\/.y 
from the electrodes.
The atomic hydrogen flame is 
calculated to be about 4,000 de
grees Centigrade. The next ap
proach to this is the oxy-acetylme 
which is about 3,300 degrees Centi
grade, and the oxy-hydrogcn which 
is about 3,100 degrees Centigrade.
It is not claimed that, this flame 
will supersede the other welding 
flames because the high wattage 
necessary makes the process a stationary one. The other forms arc 
more portable. Moreover this flame 
is not so efficient in overhead
welding. It is also of necessity a 
slower flame.
The particularly good feature of 
this flame is that it can be used 
to great advantage with non-ferrous 
metals because, being* a. reducing 
flame, it thoroughly diosidizcs the 
oxides which form on the exterior 
of these metals when they cool. 
Moreover for thin sheets of metals 
this flame will weld to a depth of 
two-thirds to three-fourths of the 
way down, thus making a per
manent and tight weld.
HIGHLAND FLING
(Continued from Page One)
The 1 ntcrfraternity Council at its 
last meeting went on record as 
favoring the wearing of Fraternity 
colors to the Highland Fling, which 
will be permitted, leaving to the in
dividual houses the manner in which 
they desire to wear them.
Because of the size of the Gyinnasium it will be necessary to better 
the lighting of the huge room and 
install apparatus to increase its 
acoustic capacity. For this purpose 
a large revolving flood-light will 
illuminate the dance floor which, to
gether with the magnificient decora
tions, will enhance a romantic Scot
tish atmosphere. To magnify . .the 
strains of music from the orchestra 
the comnfittcc is having large re
flector built behind the orchestra 
which will be elevated on a specially 
constructed platform.
Just as splendidly will the Union 
be decorated, although there will be 
no flood lights since the Union is 
in no need of them. Beautiful paper 
lights and draping ribbons will make 
the cozy Union ideal for dancing! 
The orchestra will be placed on the 
usual platform.
Refreshments in the Gymnasium 
will be served near the large exit 
which leads into the v upper part of 
Tech street (near the Gymnasium 
flagpole), while in the Union the re
freshment booth will be located as 
usual in the hallway between the 
Union and the Faculty Club Room. 
This club room, just across the cor; 
rider, will be open to the dancers. A 
check room will he found in the 
Ginynasium; also one in the Union 
if the weather is bad.
As at all other events, except the 
Carnival Show, the special Spring 
Carnival Tags, placed conspicuously,
will be requested. These are to be
attached to the coat or gown and 
left on for the duration of the eve
ning. With these the dancers may 
migrate from one dance' hall to the 
other. Further information about the 
tags will be found in another article 
in this issue.
The chairman of the committee in 
charge of the Highland Fling is
Richard Dcvcrcll of the Sigma Phi 
Epsilon Fraternity. The other mem
bers of the committee arc: Bud
Owens, Delta Tau Delta, who is in 
charge of the decorations; Frank
Foote, Phi Kappa Psi, in charge of
danccrs in Gymnasium, and Ed. 
Lewis, Sigma Phi Epsilon, in charge 
of dances in Union.
SCOTT HIGH WINS
(Continued from Page One)
Bradley ofConncllsvillc, who 
was the outstanding man in the 
entire meet, experienced little dif
ficulty in taking both hurdle 
events. In the high hurdles he 
broke the old record and set a new 
mark of 16.5 seconds which is re
markable time for any scholastic 
meet. In the low hurdles he du
plicated his high hurdle feat but 
this time lie merely tied the exist
ing record of 13-8 seconds.
In the field events an additional 
record was broken when Dan 
Glickcrt of Scott High, Toledo, 
beat out Spcnccr of Pittsburgh, by 
leaping 6 feet, 1/ inches. In the 
other jumping event, Bohlandcr, 
who had previously b/oken the 100 
yar.d record, beat Greys mark by 
5 inches by a leap which carried 
him 20 feet, 7% inches. The pole 
vault was won by Towrcy of Scott 
High, when lie cleared 11 feet, 10J/; 
inches, which is quite, a vault for 
event college athletes.
In the weight events there was 
a great deal of competition, and 
in the four events no man was able 
to win a first or second in more 
than one event. The javelin, which 
was won by , Van Fossen with a 
thro\v of 171 feet, was perhaps 
the best mark set in any of the 
events in. this division. The dis
cus throw' was won by Kabialo 
of Youngstown-with a mark of 118 
feet after lie had fouled on his first 
throw.1 Homy of Soutiji Hills, the 
expected winner, won the shot-put, 
his favorite event, with a distance 
of 44 feet, 4 inches, which, was 
just five inches better than the 
best heave of Machowitch of Aliquippa. In the hammer throw' 
there were comparatively few en
tries, which was partly due to the 
fact that niany coaches consider 
this event too strenuous for imma
ture boys. Kingley of Clairton, 
with a toss of 106 feet, bettered 
the marks of any of his rivals.
A brilliant group of athletes fea
tured by a great sprinter, a scin
tillating huyJlcr and some depend
able men in the field events, made 
the meet better than those of past 
years. The important result of the 
meet, however, is that these men 
who will be the college stars of the 
future, visited Carnegie and enjoy
ed our. hospitality. Needless to say, 
many athletes left with a favor
able impression in their minds 
which will undoubtedly help to in
fluence them to come here for 
their college4 educations.
THISTLEDOWN
Dear Mr. Thistledown: The scold
ing you have threatened to give us 
some week for the w'ay we waste 
our time on Carnegie men made 
me think very seriously for two 
or three minutes the other day. 
To see if you w'cre right, I decided 
to keep a diary for the day. I was 
so astonished at what I found, Mr. 
T., that I decided to send you a 
copy of it.
9:00Had to get up for my 9:30. 
Very sleepy and weary after the 
dancc last night. Some of these 
men certainly wrcar you out on a 
dancc floor.
10:00Stopped taking notes to 
wonder "who the boy was who kept 
staring at me last night. Hope 
Tom was jealous.
10:30Walked back to the dor
mitory with John. Wonder if he 
was broke; he didn't ask me for 
a date.
12:30Talked about the dancc at 
lunch. That spiteful Muriel who 
wasnt there said it must have been 
a scrimmage, because I looked all 
in. Why dont Carnegie, men wear 
prettier neckties?
12:45Had a long talk with Tom 
on the plionc.
2:30-.Flunked a test last hour I 
had forgotten about. Dccidcd to 
wrear green the next time I go out 
with Tom.
4:00Jack wranted me to go walk
ing in the park with him, but I 
refused because I had to study, 
so lies going to take me to the 
theater tomorrow night.
4:30Went to the library to 
studjr, but fell to chatting with 
Ruth, May and Vivian. Smiled 
frequently at Dick, who was draw
ing or something across the table.
6:45Went down to the Grill for 
an ice cream. Jack sav me and 
bought me one. . I .wish Lucy 
hadnt been there, because he talked 
to her more than he did to me.
8:00Went to Elsies whist, 
where we talked of our history 
teacher, and Isabelles brother, and 
whether Carnegie men arc better 
looking than Pitt men.
10:00Jack pickcd me up with' 
his car, and drove me home. He 
asked me for a date next week, but 
I told him I already h&ve three, 
and I have to study, sometime.
10:45Tried to study for tomor
row, but had to listen to my room
mates account of her date with 
Paul.
11:30Fell asleep wondering 
whether I really like Jack as well 
as I like Tom.
I was so astonished, Mr. Thistle
down, at the amount of time I 
spend with men, or talking or 
thinking about them, that .1 have., 
decided to become much more 
serious, and devote more time to 
my studies. It is only to show 
you that I am really in earnest, 
that I have sent you so frank y 
transcript of my secret diary. 1 
have decided to read about Diana 
in the cncyclopedies, and to cul-i 
tivate the acquaintance of some of., 
those nice girls you men call b> 
the horrid name of wall flowers:
I shall be able to find plenty oitime for my studies, because my 
head will not be full of sillj 
thoughts about boys half the time. 
My mother will be glad to hear I 
am getting" better grades. I shall 
notaccept more than two dates 3 
weekWell,' three perhapsand 1 
shall urge my boy friends to take 
out some other girls instead. J 
shall be able to eat anything 1 
like, because I wont have to worry 
so much about my looks, and keep
ing thin. Resolved, to go to bed 
every night at 10:30 .... Oh, dear 
Mr. Thistledown, Tom has just 
telephoned me, and insists I go to 
a dancc with him Tuesday, and 
Paul called directly aftcrwrards to 
insist I go out with him Wednes
day, but lie says he wont take me 
unless 1 will go riding with hirrj 
Monday/ and Mr. Thistledow'h, 1 
think T do like boys pretty well; 
after all, especially Tom and Paul, 
and .... well. . . . such silly 
resolutions ....

Little w'ondcr students are for 
religious professors! An electrical 
engineering class in the North Car
olina State College had an average 
of 12^ per cent for one of its ex
ams. When the students, went to 
class next day they found this 
note on the door:
The papers from the class are 
the poorest I ever got in 20 years 
of teaching ... It w'ould be wise 
not to bother me for the' rest 
of the week, which I must spend 
in humiliation and prayer.
A Professor Who Understands
Ive heard of blackboards that arent 
black, and chalk that isnt white,
Ive heard of plebs who have, th 
knack of sleeping some each 
night,
^But whod have thought that Na
tures hands this w'ondcr could 
create,
A Professor who really understands 
the undergraduate.
