BIG LATHE

Inspector of One of Largest Lathes Ever Built
Next Friday will mark tlie first 
annual Tartan banquet, which will 
be held at the Fort Pitt hotel at 
7:15 in the evening. This is an en
tirely new custom, which, however, 
is in .accordance with the progress 
of The Tartan. The purpose of 
the banquet will be to create a 
greater feeling of fellowship between 
the members of the staff and to 
inaugurate a custom which will be 
an annual event for The Tartan staff.
Graduate Manager Gearhart and 
Mr. H. J. McCorkle, alumni secre
tary and head of the employment 
bureau, will be the honor guestsj of 
the evening.- All past executives of 
The Tartan staff who are at present 
in Pittsburgh, have also been in
vited.
A room has been reserved at the 
Fort Pitt hotel, and plates will be 
laid for about twenty-five people.
This year has marked the greatest 
increase in popularity and circula
tion of The Tartan since its found
ing, and thus offers an opportunity 
for' establishing The Annual T*** 
tan Banquet, which will become an 
affair looked forward to-by the staff. 
The members in attendance will be 
those who, through their work and 
effort, have won the recognition of 
being a member of The Tartan 
staff, the names of whom head the 
editorial column on the second page 
of each* issue.
REGISTRATION SHOWS 
THAT TECH IS GROWING
Large Increase in Every 
School Points to Growing 
Influence of Carnegie
The official registration figures for 
the year 1916-17 have just been given 
out by Mr. Tarbell, the registrar. 
These figures show a great increase 
in' the number of students over last 
year.

This shows anincreaseofabout
five percent over the registration at 
the same time last year. Every 
school both in night and day courses 
has a large number of students over 
last year. Owing to the fact that 
this year the number of students in 
some schools and departments had 
to be limited, the figures do not 
correctly show the. growth of the in
stitution. Had all the students been 
allowed to enter who wished to the 
totals of Science and Design would 
mount considerably.
It being the custom of all regular 
papers at this time of the year to 
pick some sort of an All-American 
or all-star team, The Tartan has 
decided to do likewise. We do not, 
however, presume to be able tq pick 
an All-American team, inasmuch as, 
we realize our inexperience in this 
line, and also feel that we do not 
have enough information at hand for 
such an undertaking. However, we 
must, in order to be a regular 
paper (as mentioned above), pick 
some sort of a team, so we have 
decided to pick an all-star team com
posed of Tech players and players of 
other teams which have opposed 
Tech this season. The merits of

Monday morning a new series of 
posters met the eyes of the students 
as they entered the. campus from 
various directions. The. 1917 Thistle 
sales campaign is under way.
Sales agents for the Book of. the 
Year were called together the Tues
day afternoon before Thanksgiving 
and given a brief talk on the merits 
and methods of the campaign. Sales - 
Manager Soule was the chiefsspeaker 
and outlined his organization for the 
thorough and efficient canvassing of 
the student body and faculty of the 
four schools. It is the intention of 
the board of editors that no one may 
be able to say next spring that he 
has not been solicited for a Thistle 
subscription.
This, however, is chiefly of inter
est to those publishing and selling 
the book. What interests prospec
tive buyers much more is the con
tents and treatment which it con
tains for them.
Completeness with distinctiveness 
is the aim of the board. Its first 
object is to cover the field of 
students activities so thoroughly

A graduate of the School of Ap
plied Industries, Philip Werner,- 1909, 
Machine Construction, handled the 
inspection and testing of one of 
the largest lathes ever built accord
ing to word received recently by 
Prof. Leeds. The machine was built 
by tlie Niles-Nement-Pond Co. of 
Philadelphia, for the Government, 
and is to be used in the Panama 
Canal shops. It will swing 156 inch
es and is 65 feet between centers, 
total length of bed 83 feet; weight 
275,000 pounds; motor driven 
throughout; built at a cost of $36,- 
690.00. This machine will be used 
for turning long and heavy work, 
such as naval and coast defense 
guns; tail shafts, turbine drums, mo
tor rotors, etc.
The following extract from Mr. 
Werners letter will show that lie is 
still interested in Tech:
"Well, lyir. Leeds, I hope all. is 
going well at dear old Tech. It has 
been bout seven years since I have 
been over at the schools and I have 
heard some mighty great things 
have happened since then. During
MUSICAL CLUBS TO GIVE FIRST CONCERT OF SEASON
The Musical Clubs will give their 
first concert of the season next Fri
day evening in the Music Hall of the 
East Liberty Branch of the Carnegie 
Library. The affair will be in the 
form of a benefit for the Pittsburgh 
Settlements.
Plans are under way for an exten
sive trip through Central Ohio, to be 
made by the Musical Clubs during 
the first week of the Christmas vaca
tion.
The annual Home Concert will take 
place Friday evening, March 7, 1917, 
sin Carnegie Music Hall and will be 
followed by the usual formal dance.
LECTURE ON CEMENT IN 
INDUSTRIES ASSEMBLY
Mr. J. H. Anderson, assistant dis
trict engineer of the Universal Port
land Cement Company, delivered an 
interesting lecture, illustrated with 
a number of slides, to the students 
of the Industries School at the reg
ular Assembly meeting last Wednes
day, on The Manufacture of Uni
versal Portland Cement.
In opening, JVIr. Anderson outlined 
the history of cement from far back 
i in Roman history, and then step by 
I step the discoveries up to the pres| ent manufacture and uses of cement.
! His lecture proved very instructive 
I and was well received by the stu[ dents.
the summer, I passed the schools on 
a Forbes street car and glanced out 
of the window when passing the 
park and believe me, I hardly recog
nized or believed it to be the same 
old 'Tech I graduated from in 1909, 
for It has grown so large.
I will say that I have been get
ting along line since leaving school.
I am still with the Government as 
inspector in charge of the Philadel
phia district, handling the inspection j 
of all engineering materials for the 
Panama Canal. I have also been 
elected a junior member of the Amer
ican Society of Mechanical  Engi
neers. I am a junior member not 
on account of my abilities as I am 
certain I could have made the regu
lar membership had I boon thirty 
years - of' ago. I am also the proud 
father of a young Tochlte four years 
or age, whom I hope to send to Tech 
although ho wants to be a soldier at 
tills time, Ahem!
Mr. Worner was a member of the 
first day class in Industries School to 
take the two year course In machine 
construction.
GIRLS AT FIFTH AVE1NUE HALL ENTERTAIN
Among the most important social 
events i of Thanksgiving was the an
nual dinner dance given by the girls 
of the Fifth Avenue Hall. The din
ner started promptly at 6:30 oclock 
and the orchestra played throughout 
the evening.
The dining room was very beauti
fully decorated for the occasion. One 
large table filled the central portion 
of the room while a smaller table 
was placed in each of the four cor
ners. Each table was' decorated 
with a large vase of chrysanthe
mums, surrounded by smaller vases 
of the same flowers, and covers, were 
laid for forty, with place cards.
Long satin streamers stretched 
from the chandelier to .each end of 
the long table, where. Messrs. Lyman 
W. Sherwood and Llewellyn H. 
Rowe acted as carvers of. the tur
keys. A very elaborate menu had 
been prepared.
After the dinner the furniture in 
two of the large rooms was cleared 
away and dancing took up the re
mainder of the evening. Music was 
furnished by Mr. Gus Schnabel and 
orchestra.
CHRISTMAS RECESS WILLBEGIN ON FRIDAY, DEC. 15
!The Christmas recess will begin 
this year at the close of night 
school on Friday, December 15. 
Classes will start at 8:30 on Tues
day morning, January 2. It might be 
well to remind the students that 
double cuts and a visit to the dean 
usually follow absences immediately 
before or after vacation.

December 13 will soon be here! 
Remember it Is the date set for the 
M. M. C. S. annual Xmas bazaar. 
All student activities and depart
ments of the school have Joined 
forces with the Guild to make the 
affair a success. The purpose of the 
bazaar Is a worthy one. All pro
ceeds from the evening go to the 
Associated Charities and Settlement 
work.
Next Wednesday night, December 
13, the annual bazaar held by the 
Margaret Morrison girls will take 
place. It will be an evening affair 
only, beginning about 8 o'clock. Danc
ing for everybody will begin about 9

DATE CHANGED TO DEC. 14
Within a woelc or so a call will bo 
Issued for all candidates for the Carnoglo Tech Hockey team. Practice 
will be' Hold two or three times a 
week at Duquesno Garden after the 
egular skating hours.
The Tech team will bo plttod 
against the Garden team for practice 
games. Although the management 
doos not expect to have a regular 
schedule for the Carnegie team this 
year a few games may bo schodulod 
with other colleges which make 
hockey a real sport.
The primary objoct In calling for 
candidates now Is to start building 
up a loam worthy to roprosont the 
school for next year when hockoy 
will be rnado ono of the biggest of 
the minor'sports.
Several years ago Carnegie Tech 
was represented by a hockoy team 
that remained unbeaten and It is 
hoped that next year the Tech skat
ers 'will even outshine the teams of 
[ old. Last year, when hockey was 
revived after a long relapse, al
though Tech did not have a winning 
team, considerable enthusiasm was 
shown which bids fair to help, the 
propagation of hockey as a sport.

GENtRAL ASSEMBLY OF FOUR SCHOOLS DEC. 13
Director Hamerschlag and 
Judge Buffington to Speak. 
Miss Christine Miller Will 
Sing
----------------\
A general assembly of the four 
schools comprising the Carnogle In
stitute of Technology, Is an event 
scheduled for Wednesday, December 
13, at Carneglo Music Hall. Director 
I-Iamorsolilag will speak about the 
Unity of the Institution, and Judge 
Buffington, Judge of the United 
States Circuit Court, will address the 
student body. Then several musical 
selections and speeches by promi
nent representatives from each school 
will conclude the program.
Considerable Interest Is manifest 
over the proposed General Assembly. 
The object Is to unite the schools 
more closely, and to inculcate person
al acquaintances and friendship 
among all the students. A general 
good time for all. Judge Buffington 
needs no introduction to upper class 
men, as his address here last year 
thoroughly convinced the student 
body of his love for Carnegie Tech. 
It was Judge Buffington who insti
tuted the slogan Carnegie Clinch, 
as a symbol of all Tech activities. 
Then Christine miller, the soloist, 
will sing. She needs no further in
troduction. The program is contains 
many live numbers.
So Wednesray, December 13, at 10 
oclock, is the time for General As
sembly in Carnegie Music Hall.
All Carnegie Tech Is watching 
with extreme interest the rapidly 
completing preparations for the Pe
riod ball in Design School. The date 
has been definitely set for Thursday, 
December 14, and on that evening 
there will flash out. on our campus 
a jewel of the Slavonic peoples, 
sparkling with the life and gayety 
of that temperamental folk of the 
Russian steppes. For at ^ach one 
of those big social functions there 
is created the atmosphere of some 
great period or style from the worlds 
enormous art portfolio, and there is 
gathered, as nowhere else in Pitts
burgh, and indeed few places in the 
country, a large body of people, who 
all follow the Goddess of Beauty, 
whose best efforts are spent in at
tempting to render life more gay 
and joyful.
This year the stylo, as has been 
mentioned before, will be Slavonic; 
so chosen because in the attempt of 
modern designers to evolve or adapt 
designs which appeal to tlie people 
of today, the artistic tastes of. the 
peasant Slavs seem to strike a sym
pathetic chord. A week from tomor
row then tlioro will bo created in 
Design school, as If by magic, a fan
tastic tomplo of tho artist. Here 
will bo sensed the freedom of tho 
artistic soul as oxprossod by the 
sympathetic music, riotous color and

(3) co-operation with other faculty or
ganizations and teaching departments 
of the schools. H. A. Calderwood is

to explain the ideals and practical 
working of his department. They 
will be followed by a series in which 
the men directly engaged in each 
shop will explain their plan of work. 
It is the hope of the council that 
persons outside of the organization 
will respond to invitations to meet 
with them and discuss matters of 
common, interest. Two regular meet

now marshalled the forces of the il
lustrating department to cover the 
whole field, and results are being 
produced at an unprecedented rate.
The distinctive character of the 
inside of the book will be indicated 
by the cover, which will be attrac
tive and somewhat different from 
any college annual seen in 'these 
parts. A poster design in color is 
under way and will make the 1917 
Thistle notable among its class right 
from the first glance.
In order to produce a book worthy 
of the institution from which it 
hails, the Thistle board decided 
some time since that it would be 
necessary to raise the price to 2.50 
per copy. This is due chiefly to the 
rise in cost of practically all the ma
terials and service which enter into 
it. The Student Activities Board 
at its last meeting approved this ac
tion. Now the price slogan of the 
book is Two FiftyWorth It. The 
Thistle board says it will be, and 
then some more.
Pers'ons ordering and paying in 
full for Thistles before Christmas, 
to be given as presents to other 
people, will be presented with gift 
certificates to be delivered on Christ
mas day. These are of attractive 
design,and the editors believe their 
book is about, as good a gift to any
one interested in Tech as could be 
selected.
Hats, Plus Service
Young fellows are some
times criticised for being 
fussjr about their hats.
But they are right.
iio man can be too par
ticular about his appear
ance.
The hat is an index of 
character.
Its shape, fit, suitability 
are things, that ought to be 
given attention.
Expert hat men are a 
part of this stores service.
We never let a customer 
Tvalk away with an unsiiitable shape unless he insists 
upon it.
Next week 150 of Pittsburghs fire 
laddies and a few fire captains will 
enter Tech for a short course in en
gineer .ng and hydraulics. Consider
able difficulty has been experienced 
in filling the vacancies left by pro
motion. Mr. Ball, secretary of the 
civil service commission, found that 
the applicants would be better qual
ified to fill the vacancies if they had 
had technical {raining. He inquired 
at the schools and was referred to 
Mr. Ambrose, P. M. 0. Mr. Am
brose arranged a short practical 
course covering hydraulics and en
gineering, as far as they concern 
the fireman, which will be inaug
urated next week. A fire engine will 
be added to the already extensive 
equipment of P. M. O. to facilitate 
instructions.
The two-platoon system is in use: 
in the fire departments of the city, 
that is, two shifts, a day and a night. 
The day shift will attend school two 
nights a week and the night shift 
will receive instruction two days a 
week. The emergency appointees 
will receive preference, but if any 
fail to pass the examination every 
aspirant' to assistant engineer will 
have the opportunity. to qualify by 
study.
These arrangements, which are in 
accord with the civil service com
mission, coincide with the standard
ization policy of the city and are 
approved by Director of Public Safe
ty Charles S. Hubbard and Chief 
Engineer of the Fire Bureau James
F. Richards.

Wednesday and Thursday at the

for her own company. It is a big

For these two day.s, student tickets 
will be accepted as before at 5 cents, 
ten cents additional being charged 
for admission, the regular adult ad
mission during these two days being, 
15 cents.
Ethel Clayton and Carlyle Blackwell will be seen in The Madness 
of Helen at the Strand Friday, a 
most interesting mystery picture 
with Miss Clayton playing a dual 
role.
Saturday, Bertha Kalich and Stuart 
Holmes are seen in Love and Hate, : 
an interesting photoplay in which the 
vengeful hate of the man causes un
told torment to the woman until she 
is to able defeat his aims.
I-Iarold Lockwood and May Allison

have been seon since Rorneo and

that none of the elements that go 
to make up Tech life shall be omit
ted. All of the classes will be 
shown, with group pictures and lists 
of officers. . The graduating classes 
of the four schools will be shown 
with individual pictures of all the 
members and brief reviews of their 
student Careers, with that mixture of 
fact and fancy which wili best re
call to, mind in after years their re
lations to the community of which 
they are now a part. The faculty 
will be covered department by de
partment, so that in these two set 
of groups should appear the face, 
and it is hoped the name as well, of. 
every student and instructor in Tech.
Carnegie is this year experiencing 
a banner .athletic season, if' the per
formance of the football team is any 
criterion. This .will be chronicled in 
complete detail, with pictures of the 
players, action photographs of the 
games, and reviews of the year in 
each of the fields of sport in which 
Tech is represented. From Xale bowl 
to Forbes Field, Thistle readers will 
follow the football team (and inci
dentally one M. A. Zeller, staff photographer) andsee plays atad ' en
vironments reproduced so they will 
better remember and understand the 
glory of Carnegie in the fall of 1916. 
The other sports will also be coverod 
as fully as space and their records 
permt.
Another feature of Tecli lif.e is the 
multitude pfl .clubs, and societies 
about its campus. Practically every 
course has on', these for its mem
bers, and their rostersand group pic
tures will show, readers, of the Thistle 
what manner of folks they are and 
liow the : membership is divided 
amongst the different occupations 
for which the four schools prepare 
them.
Fraternities and sororities I will as 
heretofore honor the book by their 
presence. Some new details of treat
ment to add interest to their pages 
are under consideration. Suffice it 
to say that membership and faces 
and house pictures at least will be 
shown.
Over in the back of-the book will 
be located the dessert to top off the 
more meaty material in the earlier 
portions. This has in the past been 
called the grind section. This year 
the heading will read Kampus 
Kakkls, if the art editor and editorin-chief hold to their original inten
tion. Many of the items that have
amused us all this year will reap
pear there. The department as a 
whole will be one of. the last to be 
completed, but the reader is prom
ised much of interest. Only the
other day the upper class of Indus
tries made a contribution by voting 
on a lot of items concerning charac
teristics of Its members and of their 
collective' taste along various lines. 
The editor enjoyed the ballots much
ly, and believes he will not'be alone 
in this when the results are pub
lished. Similar votes are soon'to be 
tal^en in the other schools.}
There will, as in past years, be a 
calendar running through the adver
tising pages. A new departure this 
time will be a number of cartoon il
lustrations pertaining to the different 
news items. Its going to be good.

is also destined to be of notable 
quality. Art Editor Crooks and his

The Engineer Society of Western 
Pennsylvania, for several years 'past 
has set-problems in'engineer subjects 
for competition' by the various engi
neering schools and colleges of the 
country. Among the problems set 
were those in civil engineering, elec
trical engineering, 'mechanical, engi
neering, etc. . Last  year, out, of a: 
possible thirteen < places, ' Cardkgf^ 
Tech won eleven and this caused the 
society to feel that the annual com
petition was becoming too one-sided 
and it decided to .'drop the custom.
Because of the value of these com
petitions to the'stiidents of engineer
ing, promoting, as they, do',  a  keener 
.interest in engineering subjects and 
a corresponding grasp of the details 
of technical  study, efforts are being 
made to obtain the support of the 
large national societies' of tlliscoun
try to further this phase of technical 
education. In response to letters to 
these societies, Dean Leete  has re
ceived replies indicating the favora
ble  attitude, in which the idea, has, 
been received by the national socie
ties and it is thought that  it. will. be 
but a short time before, the work on 
these problems will be resumed by 
Tech students.

Although Carnegie is ably represented in all athletic lines, debating 
is one activity that has been practi
cally absent from Tech. The im

estimated and it is only by practice 
in college that this training can be 
secured.
To fulfill this .want the C. I. T.

WORK STARTED ON NEW 
ONE-FIFTH MILE TRACK
Track Squad to Have Best 
Track in Several Years
Work was started lapt Saturday 
morning on the new cinder track at 
Tech Feld. Several loads of new 
cinders have already been drawn on 
the field and these will be used in 
putting the tracks in good condition 
for the spring. When completed, the 
Carnegie sprinters will have a, well 
'built track, one-fifth of a mile long. 
The work is under the supervision of 
Coach Eyman and Track Manager 
Rembler. It Is expected that the 
track will be ready for use in a cou
ple of weeks.
During the last week several short 
distance men have ibeen working out 
in order to get into good oondition 
for spring. Some of them already 
have their eye on the Penn relay 
races which are the next on the track 
equad and program. The prospects 
that Carnegie have  for a successful 
year for the sprinters have never 
before been equaled.

CHRISTMAS CARDS!
When it comes to Christmas cards, 
those printers are regular devils 
(printers devils.) They have plaster

erary styleoh heavings!
But in spite of the posters, thero 
has been a never-ending caravan of
