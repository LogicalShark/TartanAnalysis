Farce, Comedy, 
Tragedy Comes 
To Union Friday
By ROY MINET
A human comedy of back-stage life, a lively farce, and a study of a German woman left stranded in London at the outbreak of the Worlds War will provide another afternoon of brisk entertainment in one-act play form in the Unions Studio Theater next Friday at 3:30.
These popular matinees promise to tax the seating capacity of the Union. So large was the audience at the program presented on the afternoon of October 21, that many of the late-comers were obliged to stand until the end of the first play when seats could be provided.It is not only the students, and faculty members who have shown such a great interest in these intimate performances. Many clubs and civic organizations have responded to the opportunity offered, of enjoying groups of one-act plays capably produced, and are planning matinee parties for a number of the remaining fourteen programs at present scheduled.Professor Chester Wallace is supervising the student directors who are preparing Fridays entertainment. Robert Stanton Gill is presenting the war drama with Jean A. Dahl and William G. Beal. Irene J. Cowan is directing Janet W. Feather, Jane IC. Wittmer, Marie E. Noir, William E. Roos, and Harry S. Schofield in the comedy offering. Herman Liveright is producing the farce played by Audrey L. Kelley, John G. Dawson, and Walter H. Derdeyn.
Student Council Directs 
Local Charity Drive 
On Campus
The annual Welfare Drive, under 
the direction of the Student Coun
cil, which will begin on November 
9 and will continue through No
vember 23, is Carnegies contribution in the national movement to build upa relief fund to aid the unemployed and relief organizations in Allegheny County.It has been the custom in former years for the student body of Carnegie to contribute to a welfare fund. In accordance with this custom, each student .has been asked to donate a dollar to the fund this year. If, in any case, he student is unable to contribute the dollar that is required, the sponsors of the drive want to emphasize that any suitable contribution will be accepted.A card bearing the students name will'be in the hands of a class representative in his section. If the student contributes immediately, he will be given a receipt for the amount of the contribution. Those who wish to pledge their support to the drive may do so by signing their card and signifying the amount of the donation. These pledges will then b collected at a later date.The drive will be carried on in the four collegs' by a committee of five student representatives under the general direction of John P. Iiiltz 34: This committee includes Warren Ailes 34, in the College of Engineering; Edmund J. McCormick 34, College ofIndustries; James Latta 36, Engineering and Industries Freshmen; Rosemary Saxton 34, College of Fine Arts; and Jean Ritzel 34, 
Margaret Morrison.The money collected will be used by over seventy different agencies in the Pittsburgh district, and will go toward the aid of the needy in the surrounding districts. As the local Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. are included in these various organizations and as these groups 
play a large part in meeting the requirements of needy on the campus and in the immediate vicinity, it is hoped that every Carnegie student will do his or her part in making the drive a financial suc
cess.

CommitteePlansEducational 
Program For Freshmen 
' In All Colleges
By ANTHONY J. CACCHIONEWith the official adoption of the 
rushing rules by the Interfraternityi Council last Saturday there came into existence a plan which is believed very simple in operation and which will permit the freshmen to become better acquainted with a larger number of fraternity men. The plan consists of a two. day contacting period and a nine day open rushing period.By eliminating the Saturday morning dash across the dormitory lawn, the Council sought to avoid the usual confusion which occurred in the past years. According to the rushing rules, a period of contacting will commence ..on Wednesday, November 30, at 4:20 in the afternoon, during which time the fraternity men may meet rushees and arrange dates for the open rushing period. It is hoped that there will be enough time in the two days for the fraternity men to contact the rushees more than once and to see that the dates are kept. Rushing, however, during 
this period will be absolutely forbidden.Following the contact period there will be a short period of silence when no contacting or rushing can be' done. Open rushing will begin on Friday, December 2, at 8:30 in the morning and will terminate on Sunday morning, December 11, at 1:00 a. m.In consideration of the existing economic conditions, the Council has adopted the resolution that the number of social events during open rushing be limited to one paid orchestra dance. Fraternities will be allowed to hold smokers or radio dances over the two weelcends.Bidding will be permitted any time after the beginning of open rushing season. The rushees will signify their acceptance of bids by presenting themselves at the houses of their Choice on Sunday morning, December 11, at 10:00a. m.Feeling the need of a program of orientation for the freshmen, the Council has appoiiited a Publicity Committee which will be responsible for acquainting the freshmen with the idea of a well balanced 
distribution of dates during open rushing season. The following men were appointed to the committee: Robert E. Robinson, chairman; John W. Ladd, and ChesterC. Williamson.At a meeting of the Council next Saturday, the rushing rules adopted will be interpreted. At this meeting, each house will be required to place a bond of $50 with the treasurer of the Council,, which 
will be forfeited in case of any infraction of the rushing rules.

Straw Vote; Faculty 
Also Participates
If tlie vote of Carnegie students 
is an indication of the sentiment 
of the United States in the coming 
election, Herbert Hoover will be 
re-elected as the President of the 
United States. He won the straw vote conducted on the campus last Wednesday, by at'two to one margin. In the student ballot he received 808 of the 1,576 votes cast, while Franklin D. Roosevelt received 421, Norman Thomas 326, and William Fostei; 21. Hoover likewise won the Fac^ty Poll, receiving 65 out of the '?.20 votes cast. Franklin D. Roosevelt received 29 and Norman Thoruo 26.Analyzing the results of the voting by sex, it is found that of l,03y men student voting, 529 voted for Hoover, >29S for Roosevelt, and 212 for Thomas. The distribution of the women students votes was similar to the-mens. The women cast 285 votes out of 453 for Hoover, 190 for Roosevelt, and 18 for Thomas. All of the votes Foster received were cast by men.Geographically, the results present. a different aspect. Pennsylvania was strong for Hoover and gave him 596 votes as against 186 for Roosevelt and 108 for Thomas. Ohio, was also pro-Hoover, giving him 86 votes while Roosevelt received 26 and Thomas 12. The New York students seemed to bo undecided as to their choice and 
polled 29 votes for Roosevelt, 29 for Hoover and 20 for Thomas.The situation was similarly tied in New Jersey, and several other states. Roosevelt carried only two states, Kentucky and Louisiana,

Drama Head Is 
Sponsoring Parly
Professor Kenyon, Head of the 
Department of Drama, is forming 
a theater party to attend Walter 
Hampdens presentation of Cy
rano de Bergerac on Monday and 
Friday evenings, November 7 and
11. The importance not only of 
Mr. Hampdens characterization of 
Cyrano, but the greatness of the 
play itself promises to attract 
large audiences, so students should,/ 
quickly grasp their opportunity to 
get regular $1.10 tickets for half price. Orders, cash in advance, should be placed immediately with Professor Kenyon in his office in 
the College of Fine Arts.Edmond Rostands Cyrano de Bergerac is one of the great plays of all time. It stands alone in the realm of modern romantic comedy; even Shakespeare created nomore fascinating character than the big-nosed Gascon adventurer, whose renuunciation and self-sacri
fice in order that the woman h loved might wed the man she adored and be happy, is one of tb 
noblest figures in literature.As dramatic entertainment "Cyrano has extraordinary variety. No other modern play is so filled with big scenes that progress in. crescendo to a thrilling denouement; nor is there any other in which comedy, romance, pathos,, and roystering adventure are sostirringly intermingled. The version of the play used by Mr. Hamp
den was especially made for him by Brian Hooker. Competent critics have pronounced it an English masterpiece equal to tho French original.

Second Period Of 
Great Contest
PLAID ATTACK FAILS 
ON OWL GOAL LINE
Kavel Again Proves Temple 
Nemesis As Skibos Mar 
Easterners Record
1 The Carnegie Tech and Temple 
University football representatives 
met last Friday night before 25,000 
wild-eyed fans and when the final 
curtain went down, another famous 
Tartan-Owl battle was entered in the records. It was the kind of contest which the spectators like to take home and play over, and the kind which has made Carnegie a fighting favorite in Philadelphia. The 7-7 score indicated to the 
fullest measure how bitterly the two teams each struggled for victory.
In the matter of first downs and total advanced yardage, Carnegie 
outplayed Temple, but the Tartan scoring punch failed at the psychological moment in the third quarter and thereby hangs the tale. As a last, desperate measure the Skibos tried a long field goal from the 40-yard line but Stewarts attempt was a bit wide and the final whistle blew just a few minutes later.
Again, as last year, the bogeyman of Temples victory dreams proved to be George Kavel. At the very start of the game it wa3 Kavels long runbaclc of the kickoff which first threw a scare into the Owls and for the remainder of the period placed them on the defensive. And in the first play of the second quarter George broke off tackle deep in his own territory and raced clear to the Temple 17 where he was dragged down from behind. From this point the Tartans put on the pressure and, with the aid of an interference penalty, drove the ball aver for their only score. Spisak accounted for the touchdown and Stewart booted the ball neatly between the uprights tor the extra point.
Temples score also came in the second stanza and resulted largely from Carnegies deficient passing defense. The Owls completed numerous long passes and would up, after a 70-yard advance, with a first down on the Tartan 10-yard stripe. Four straight smashes at the line and Johnson, a really great back, 
was over for the score. This same Johnson added the extra point that meant so much, with a perfect place-kick.
Th Tartan aerial attack was practically a negative quantity, with the exception of one beautiful 40-yard heave from Bevevino to Ostroslcy which placed the ball on the Temple seven-yard mark. Two 
running plays moved the oval up to the one-foot line but with victory jUst 12 short inches away and two downs to go the Slcibo attack was suddenly rendered impotent by the fighting Cherry and White players who erected the proverbial stone wall and took the pigskin away from Carnegie on downs. From this heartbreaking point on, with the exception of the time when Dame Fortune frowned on Stewarts field goal attempt, the Owls had little trouble in holding the Techites at bay.For the Tartans, Kavel, who continues to be the most talked of man in Temple football circles, was the shining light and stood 
head and shoulders above all theother ball carriers in the game. Joe Milims fine kicking and general all-around good play wras also a great asset to the Tartans. CoCaptain Hooks Sample started his first game since the Reserve affair and his presence throughout the entire 60 minutes of play aided Carnegie no little. Temple was forced to play without the services of her great little quarterback Len Whittock, but made up for it by trumping the Skibos defensive aces with Jack Johnson.

This afternoon the Tartan sharp
shooters will dust off their trusty 
muskets and commence on another 
long season. The schedule this 
year calls for matches from the 
middle of November until the lat
ter part of Apiil.
Coach Sommer has on his roster 
several of last years lettermen and 
team members, and besides, a fair 
squad from the freshmen from last 
year. However, the loss of such 
men as Beckert and Scherba, two 
of iast year's stalwarts, will leave some mighty large gaps to be filled. Reporting this afternoon will be: Painter, Buse,. Irons, Dickson, Stirling, Miller, Merriman, Parker; and from last years Plebe team: Hamilton, Morehouse, Gass, Dorrel, and M,ellinger.This years schedule is not yet complete but there promises to be oyer a hundred outstanding colleges on the list with whom individual telegraphic matches will be shot. Carnegie is always a strong contender in such large nation-wide matches as the National Intercollegiate Match, The Engineers Trophy Match, The Hearst Trophy Match. Several shoulderto-shoulder matches are also being scheduled, all of which points to a very busy year for the marksmen.

caused by the resignation of John W. Ladd, 33, Pi Kappa Alpha.

The Carnegie Tech Harriers 
gained their first victory of the 
year by decisively defeating Geneva 
16-39 in Schenley Park last Satur
day. The Plaid runners placed five 
out of the first six men. gaining the first four places and coming within one point of a perfect score. Captain Schell led the Tartans to the tape, followed closely by Allan. The time, 29 minutes, 42.4 seconds was rather slow probably because of a high wind and the lack of stiff competition.The order of finishing was: First, Schell, Carnegie; second, Allan, Carnegie; third, Giolma, Carnegie; fourth, Stankey, Carnegie; fifth, Wray, Geneva; sixth, Burke, Carnegie; seventh, Hamilton, Geneva; eighth, Witherow, Geneva; ninth, Netzer, Geneva; tenth, Sweringen, Geneva.The Tartan rooters had a good chance to see the Pitt thinly-clads in action as they raced against Penn State-just before Tech started against the Covenanters. The Pitt Frosli also strutted their stuff against the Penn State youngsters shortly after. Penn State had little trouble taking over Pitt which means the Penn State team was plenty good.
The Skibo Hill-and-Dalers engage Westminster over the Schenley Park course on Saturday. After coming through with an unexpected decisive victory over Geneva last Saturday the Tartans should have little trouble with the Presbyterians. Geneva already chalked up a decisive victory-over Westminster in an early season contest. 
However, the Tartan Harriers had better use every opportunity to improve for on following Saturdays they meet the strong teams of West Virginia and Pitt.The Tartan Plebe Harriers lost to the Schenley Runners 32-27 in Schenley Park last Wednesday. This makes the second defeat for the Freshmen in two starts, the first one being administered by Peabody. The only outstanding man so far this season is Gariety. The Plebes are unusually weak this year, probably due to a very late start.The schedule for the remainder of the season lines Up with an A.

Hoover Takes Lead

receiving the total vote of the students from eacli state. Thomas and Foster failed to muster a majority in any one state. Records 
show that Hoover carried 33 of the 37 states represented, Roosevelt 2, and a tie resulted in the remaining state.
Of the total ballots cast, 550 were from students who were eligible to vote. Of this group 256 favored Hoover, 1S6 Roosevelt, and 10 Foster.
In surveying the entire poll it is interesting to note that the majority of the students treated the balloting in a serious manner. The number of facetious votes was almost negligible. It was only through the co-operation of the administration and faculty that Tartan was able to gather accurate political sentiment at Carnegie.

Carnegie Alumni w'ill hold their sixth annual home-coming on November IS and 19, the week-end of "he Carnegie-University of Pitts
burgh football game. This date, marks the regular fiftli-year reunions for the graduates of the classes of 1912, 1917, 1922, and 1927.As in previous years, the program for the alumni will follow an organized plan of entertainment. Registration will take place the morning of November IS in the Trophy Room of the Gymnasium Building. Alumni are requested to register as soon as they arrive on the Campus. President Baker will entertain the members of the Class of 3912 and their husbands and wives at a luncheon at noon. This! ;event is in accordance with the .custom that the President entertain the oldest reunion class; the members of 1912 are meeting for their twentieth year. The reunion committee for the class of 1912 is: Engineering, John F. Laboon; Industries, II. M. McCuliy; Arts, P, It. Sterling; Margaret Morrison,'; Mrs. W. H. I-Iarrold. Luncheon for all other returning alumni will bo served in the Commons Annex Dining Room. To those to whom the name is unfamiliar, the Commons 
is now located at the site of the old Langley Laboratory.
In the afternoon at 2 oclock appointees of each class have been designated to make the presentation of reunion class plates to be added to the pattern begun by the 190S class in the main corridor of Administration Hall. At this time Dr. Baker will officially welcome the returning alumni. The senior lionoraries, Mortar Board and Dragons, will participate in the program, and the Glee Club will
sing the Alma Mater and Fight for the Glory of Carnegie.Dean Green to Entertain AlumnaeDean Green will entertain the alumnae at tea at 4 oclock in the Womens Club Room of the Gymnasium Building. The Department 6f Drama will present Ibsens Pillars of Society" in a special performance for Alumni at 8:15 in the Little Theater, College of Fine Arts. Tickets, which are necessary for this performance, may be secured at the Alumni Office. Before the theater performance, the class of 1917 will hold a reunion banquet at the Hotel Schenley at 6 oclock under the chairmanship of Thomas E. Orr.
No program has been arranged for Saturday morning, this time having been left open for special reunion parties and individual group plans. The Margaret M,orrison, Alumnae have already selected 
this morning for their breakfast, which will take place at 12 oclock.At 2 o'clock Carnegie will play its annual football game against the University of Pittsburgh in the Pitt Stadium. Tickets may be secured at the Alumni Office.Cabaret Dlnner-Dance Saturday.
A cabaret dinner-dance will be. held on Saturday night in the Hotel Schenley for all reunion classes and all other alumni and friends who .will be in Pittsburgh for the home-coming. In order to enable all alumni to attend this affair, the dance is scheduled for Saturday night this year instead of Friday night as was formerly the cake. Arrangements have been made to have tables set up for those desiring to play biidge. The committee has secured Will Ryshaneks National Broadcasting Orchestra.
IN THE FIRST NIGHT GAME IN WHICH THE CARNEGIE TECH TARTANS HAVE EVER ENGAGED, they showed the fans of the Quaker City one of the best games of the season and emerged from the field with a 7-7 tie with the strong Temple Owls. It took the Tartans, who were the underdogs, only a short while to prove to the home team that they had been under rated; for in two minutes after the opening 
kickoff the Owls were in the shadows of their own goal posts fighting fiercely to thwart a Plaid score. The Tartans finally tallied at the opening of the second quarter but the final chalkmark had to be crossed three times before it was scored as a touchdown. Kavel carried the ball over twice, the first time it was ruled that he had been momentarily downed on the two-yard marker, and the second time the backfield was in motion and a five-yard penalty inflicted. However, on the next play Bill Spisak scored on an end run. Temples score also came in this quarter. An uninterrupted drive of eighty yards, featured by several long passes put the pigskin on the two-yard line, from where Johnson, Temples stellar left halfback, plunged over for six points.
THE TARTAN'S ATTACKED CLICKED BETTER ON FRIDAY NIGHT THAN IT HAS AT ANY TIME THIS YEAR. This can be shown by the fact that the Skibos gained more than 200 yards by rushing and continually had the ball in their opponents territory. And Heine Millers big Cherry and White team were the favorites to win by two touchdowns. Once or twice the playing was ragged, but for the most part it was good, and if the improvement keeps up future opponents are going to have a tougher time than they have anticipated. On three different occasions the Plaid team penetrated deeply into the Owls territory, but for some reason or other the necessary scoring punch was lacking. The best chance was in the third quarter when a pass, from Bevevino to Ostrosky which was good for forty-five yards, put the ball on the twenty-one-yard marker. Kavel took the ball up to the seven-yard line for a first down, but when fourth down came along the ball was still several inches from the final chalk mark. Later in the game an attempted field goal by Stewart from the 42-yard line narrowly 
missed being good.
CO-CAPTAIN GEORGIE KAVEL PROVEb TO BE THE BEST BACK ON THE FIELD, and although a marked man before the game started he was poison to the Owls all evening. In spite of a bad ankle George galloped away 1jo several long gains and numerous shorter ones. On the opening kickoff he carried the ball across midfield and was finally forced out of bounds on the home teams 43-yard line. At the beginning of the second quarter the bespectacled Tartan captain ran from midfield to the opponents 35-yard line, reversed his field and reached the 17-yard rnjirk before he was downed.Co-Captain Hooks Sample returned to the lineup for the first time since the V;-. & J. game, and was a big factor in stopping the Owls attack at t!ie line of scrimmage. Bevevino also played for the first time since the W. & J. contest, and the manner in which he directed the tea,i brought back memories of some of his exploits last year. If he 0&n continue to play as well as he did Friday he will stand a good chance to be the first choice for the quarterback position.
THE FOOTBALL TEAM GETS A WEEK'S REST BECAUSE OF AN OPEN DATE IN THE SCHEDULE. The Skibos do not play until November 12, when they encounter Xavier in Cincinnati. For the next three weeks the Plaid mentors will be working on the squad in an endeavor to whip them into shape for the Pitt game November 19. And, believe it or not, the coaches are in a tough spot when one happens to think of what the Pitt Panther, did to Notre Dame.
HOW THOSE SOUTH BENDERS CAN KEEP FROM INSTALLING A MACHINE GUN as part of ther regular equipment when they meet a Pittsburgh eleven is beyond me, because teams from this Smoky City have proved to be a stumbling block for the Galloping Irish. The 12-0 defeat which the Panthers administered to "Hunk Andersons boys marks the third time that Irish elevens have succumbed to Pittsburgh opponents, and no doubt two of these marred an otherwise unbeaten record. In 1926 and 1928 the Tartans did the trick and this year the Panthers step out in front. Just how great the 1932 Notr& Dame team is remains to be seen. If the Irish can come back after that defeat they are good, but if they let it disrupt their whole schedulewell, they are nothing more than mediocre. However, I still believe that Notre Dame has the best team in the country, in spite of their defeat by Pitt. I think this will be proved by future scores. Except for that one play where Sebastian broke through for a touchdown, the Irish had the edge. But we can not take the credit away from Pitt who did vOhat many football critics said was Impossible, and that wasstop Notre Dame.
COACH C5UY IIALFERTYS CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM came through %ylth a well earned 16-39 victory against Geneva on the Schenley Park .course oil Saturday. The Tartans, led by Captain Bob Schell, who came in first, took live out of six places, Geneva placing one man fifth. The meet this week against Westminster should be taken easily by the Plaid runners.The plebe team has yet to win a meet having lost to Schenley 
.and Peabody.
COACH ALLEN RIESDORPH IS HAVING A TOUGH TIME WITH THE SWIMMING TEAM this year. He has more would-be swimmers than he knows what to do with, as 65 men are out for the Freshman and Varsity teams. This gives Coach Riesdorph the distinction of being the first Carnegie coach to ever have more candidates for a team than he can successfully handle. That is in quantity; we cant vouch for the quality. Maybe it is the personality that gets 'em. How about it coach? Better dispense the secret to some of the less for
tunate mentors.

Start Institute 
For Advancement 
Of Higher Study
Plans for a projected Institute for Advanced Study are going forward as a result of the donation of $5,000,000 by Louis Bamberger and Mrs. Felix Fuld, of Newark, New Jersey. This Institute will be temporarily located in the. Fine ball at Princeton until the new buildings are completed.
The object of the institute is to bring together the best of teachers, scholars, research workers and students so that they may concentrate tlieir efforts more favorably in the solution of scientific problems. The institute will be opened only to post graduate students of exceptional promise. It is the hope of Dr. Abraham Flexner, the director, to establish a school of higher thought in America comparable with some of the great European scientific schools, such as lEcole Polytecbnique in France and Gottingen in Germany. Those things usually thought of in connection with universities such 
as football games, parties and balls will be entirely absent at the institute. The faculty and staff will be entirely free to forge ahead, each in his own respective field without any outside distractions. It ought to make an ideal haven for many of our scholars.Dr. Albert Einstein has been invited to become Professor of Mathematical and Theoretical Physics and has accepted. About seven months of his time will be spent at the institute, and the remaining five months of the year in Germany. The institute should provide the means of concentrating at one place men of right capability where, they can work together and have the benefit of each others help and advice. Not only does this proposed institute, which is already starting to become a reality, offer a means of solving some of our most perplexing problems but it also will initiate an era of higher education in Amer
ica.
Dorm. Rooms Available 
For Night Students
Rooms in the Mens Dormitories are available for night students. Some twenty night men now live in the dormitories. Any one interested may secure information on Monday evenings at the office of the Dean of Men, Administration Hall. The rate is S3.00 a week for a single room and $2.30 for a double room. The rooms are furnished, and the Institute provides light, heat, bed linen, and service. Three of the dormitories'have outdoor sleeping porches. All of them have shower baths on each floor.

size one could almost imagine himself in a region that Dante so well described in his 'Divine Comedy." Burning fires flared up here and there, dark unrecognizable shadows moved around, smoke and fumes filled the air. The picture was awe inspiring despito its terrifying aspect. Molten metal 
poured from one crucible into another reminded me of a river of fire, sparks flying all around the room brought back pictures of mid-summer fireflies and fireworks. All in all the place attracted me as no other shop had done so far. Suddenly powerful lights 
flooded the room and I was awakened abruptly from a pleasant dream. Under the glare of these lights an interesting picture was transformed into an ugly, everyday scene of a dirty foundry.
Classes were over, the nights work done, and the tour was concluded, but some day I am going to invade the Arts School and see what is going on over there. Sure Ill tell you all about it.
The officers of the Night College 
of Engineering and Night College 
of Industries are requested to turn 
in a list of the names of all those 
night students who worked at the 
functions held by these colleges so 
far this year.
The point system for insignia 
award requires that the names of 
the students working at any col
lege function shall be turned over 
to the vice president of the Coun
cil immediately after the function 
takes place. These names should 
therefore be turned in within the 
next week so that all the students 
who worked will receive proper 
credit towards an insignia award. 
All students who have worked at 
any affair should check up with 
those in charge of the function and 
see that their name has been turn
ed in.
Upon completion of an early 
class the other evening this curi
ous reporter decided to find out 
what the rest of the campus was 
doing. To have the authorities 
put on a special exhibition night 
show was out of the question, so 
the next best thing to do was to 
wander around to see what could 
be seen. The Industries school 
presented an enticing picture and 
a good place to go, so a start for 
this building was made.
After strolling down the corri-. dor a short distance, sounds of hammering and buzzing were heard and these attracted my attention. Investigation of the source of noise brought me to the wood working shop. Here grown men were making miniature houses, doll houses I suppose, and others were working on lathes, while still others were busy laying out patterns. The scene was interesting, but I do not care much for wood work so I moved along. A little further down the corridor and down the steps, brought me to j the tin shop. Here were all sorts of dodads and gadgets hanging around in a bewildering collection. Grotesque shapes reminded me of objects ranging from sinister implements to humorous puzzles. No doubt they served their purpose and the students probably learned something when they made them, but none of that for me, so on to some other scene of activity.
The printing department attracted me next, but only for a moment because a clanging which was accompanied by intermittent flashes of light further down the corridor proved too much for my curiosity. Following these sounds brought me into the foundry. Here in a dimly lit room of enormous

On November 12
Balloting Preceded By 
Usual Speeches And 
Much Cheering
The annual election smoker of 
the Night College of Engineering 
was held Saturday evening, Octo
ber 22, in the Union. Although 
the affair was originally scheduled 
to be held in the gymnasium be
cause of a ruling that the use of 
the Union for smokers was to be 
discontinued, the change back to 
the Union was a very happy move.
A varied program was provided for the evening and consisted of selections by the Mens Glee Club, a string quartet, and songs and cheers which were led by a cheer leader from the day school.
A new feature for the smoker was a showing of a series of talking pictures dealing with a phase of the operations of a large communication organization. Through the efforts of Mr. George C. Garliart, who arranged this part of the program, the extensive and complicated equipment necessary to properly project such a series of pictures was furnished by the Bell Telephone Company. The pictures were exceedingly interesting 
and new information was presented in an entertaining manner on the absorbing technique of electric communication and its various aspects.Professor Robert B. Leighou, Associate Director of Night Courses, was a guest and gave an interesting short talk to those present. Following this address the various officers of the school spoke and the college proceeded to elect officers for the year. The results of the election were: Mr. Alexander J. Lois, president; Mr. Robert L. Slocum, vice president; Mr. Ar
thur W. Luck, secretary, and Mr. Robert W. Lahr, treasurer.The business meoting of the smoker was concluded, and those in attendance were treated to a tasty lunch which consisted of the usual refreshments furnished at such occasions.

new night students. Our Council 
takes this aspect of the night stu

social functions for the various 
colleges throughout the year, in 
the nature of dances, or other so
cial functions.
The first dance to be held this year will be sponsored by the Night College of Fine Arts for the students who are registered in that particular college. The date set for the party is November 12 and the necessary reservations have been made to secure Thistle Hall. Tentative plans have been made by those in charge of the dance and the completed arrangements will be announced shortly.All night students who are registered in the Night College of Fine Arts and who have paid the Night Student Council Activities Fee are permitted to attend the dance. Tickets will be distributed shortly to those who have their registration card so the night art 
students should be sure to have this registration card with them to insure receipt of a ticket.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT the night engineers held their annual bawl, and what a bawl it was. Some of our best citizens showed a surprising lack of courtesy as well as acumen especially when some deep thinking was necessary.THAT the repetition of last years performance of the who took those pickles comedy was omitted, and this by the way was a bright spot in an otherwise hectic evening.THAT washroom towels seem to be plentiful this year. Either some one is on his toes, or the students dont wash as often. THAT two big shots had their maps spread all over our page last week. Whos your praise agent boys? THAT by this time the Arts and Industries will have had their new officers elected and the new council should be ready to go.

A Plea For Co-operation
My dear Mr. Ladcl:
From time to time, I receive anonymous letters which are 
aimed to bring to my notice conditions within the Institute 
which the writers think should be remedied. The person who 
criticizes should support his criticisms by giving his name and 
thereby aiding in the correction of the situation of which he 
complains. I am always willing to discuss in confidence .with a 
student or a member of the faculty any question, which, in his 
f opinion, should be brought to my consideration.
It is hardly necessary for me to speak of the unfairness of 
the person who makes charges and arouses suspicions concern
ing people with whom we are associated, without having the 
courage to help me prove or disprove the charges.
Very sincerely yours,
THOMAS S. BAKER.
President.
The New Rushing Rules
Last Saturday the Interfraternity Council passed what is 
believed to be another new set of rushing rules. As a matter 
of fact the rules differ little from those of former years, except 
in the provision for the contacting of rushees.
After the termination of rushing season last year, a num
ber of the representatives on the Council expressed dissatisfac
tion with the rules. Because the rules were so unsatisfactory, 
the Council took immediate steps to formulate a plan which 
would alleviate many of the evils of the old system, and at the 
end of the year a set drawn up after much study was recom
mended to this years Council. This new set embodied princi
ples which had worked successfully at several of the largest 
universities in the country and it was honestly believed that 
the rules, if adopted, would result in better rushing conditions 
at Carnegie.
Despite the fact that the committee last year investigated 
the rushing rules of many other colleges and spent nearly a 
whole semester choosing the best points from the most success
ful systems, the Interfraternity Council sees fit this year to dis
regard all of this work and revert to the old rules, merely add
ing to them a contacting period during which time none of 
the dates made for open rushing period are binding. The suc
cess of the new contacting period can be determined only after 
the termination of the contacting season. It.is unfortunate that 
the degree of success cannot be foreseen.
In all events, the rules have been adopted and it is now up 
to the Council to see that they are enforced.
THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
The United States will go to the polls next. Tuesday to decide who will be at its li.elm for the coming term. Each candidate will make his last attempt to sway the voters of the nation to support him and his party. Herbert Hoover, feeling that the East has been well covered, lias shifted his scene of action to the middle west and plans on making speeches in many major cities. There is even a possibility of his crossing the country to vote at his home in Palo Alto, California, which, by the way, is in the territory where the Republicans need every vote they can muster. If he makes this trip the monotony of it will doubtlessly be relieved by several speeches in major cities along the route.One does not like to let an election go by without some mention of the inroads made by some minor party into the folds of the major parties. In the coming election, it is likely that the Socialist party, headed by Norman Thomas, will win a great moral victoryin that they will probably poll the largest vote ever awarded a minor party in recent years. That they will carry any one state is doubtful. While mentioning parties, it is evident that the Republican partys elephant is not normal in that the period of gestation of a normal elephant is eighteen months, and the Republican elephant has been trying to find a solution to the European debt problem for a much longer period and has not even given birth to an idea.Our next door neighbors in Canada have recently passed a new and higher tariff which will hurt United States manufacturers to a 
great degree. This new tariff is a preferential one which allows British goods to enter Canada under a much lower tariff rate than goods from other countries. The products which will bo affectod greatly are iron and steel, chemicals, glass, tobacco, and many other items manufactured by both the United States and England. Whether or not this is a retaliation tariff is hard to say, but it may have some effect on Congress in
the future when it thinks of another tariff revision.
Japan seems to have plenty of money to feed and clothe an army which the rest of the world, declares. to be too large, while more than 200,000 of her school children are underfed. This certainly is a more important problem for Japan than the acquisition of land.
Some fourteen years ago after the Great War, three small nations banded together to form the Kingdom .of Jugo-Slavia. They were Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. Today this kingdom threatens to break apart because the individual nations are dissatisfied with conditions. The government has already blockaded part of the coast ofl Croatia, which was strongest in its revolutionary measures. Alexander, who is both king and dictator of the country, has brought Croatia from an uncertain position after the war to one of comparative stability. The world wide depression has hit Jugo-Slavia, as it has most other nations. However, on the rebound, the original small nations each feel as though they would be better off with' their own individual identities. If the present disturbance continues, Croatia will surely become independent and perhaps another of the states may be able to follow suit.
Albert Einstein has consented to accept the chair of Professor of Mathematical and Theoretical Physics in the newly planned Institute for Advanced Study which will be located at Princeton University until its own buildings are completed. Dr. Einstein will remain in this country to teach from October 1 to April 15 each year, beginning next fall. The Institute will concentrate its aim exclusively upon quality in the selection of its students and faculty rather than on numbers and sensational investigations. The establishment of this Institute with its distinguished faculty * should give the United States a better position in the field of intellectual and scientific knowledge.

Two Lectures 
To Be Given At 
Lecture Hall
Exhibit Of Locally Owned 
Paintings To Open 
On December 14
The Department of Fine Arts of Carnegie Institute, in conjunction 
with an exhibition of International paintings owned by residents of Pittsburgh which will open today and continue through December 15, announces two lectures to be given in the Carnegie Lecture Hall. The first talk will be presented by Royal Cortissoz, art critic of the New York HeraldTribune on Monday evening, November 7, and the second will be presented by Dudley Crafts Watson of the Art Institute of Chicago, on Monday evening, November 14.Since no International Exhibition of paintings will be held this year, the Department of Fine Arts of the Institute has planned this exhibition of locally-owned paintings as a review of the thirty annual exhibitions since 189G. This exhibition will also give a fairly accurate account of the art of painting in Europe and America over a period of the last thirtysix years, and will be an index of the type of paintings which have been purchased by Pittsburghers for their homes during this period.There -will be about 100 paintings in the exhibition which were either purchased from an Inter
national, lent by citizens of Pittsburgh to the exhibitions, or painted by Pittsburgh artists who exhibited in the Internationals. No. one artist will be represented by more than one painting.This exhibition is in no way intended or planned as a substitute for the annual International, but is one that has been in the minds of the officials of the Institute for many years, the opportune time for organizing it presenting itself this season.
Iron Age Editor 
Gives Views On 
Steel Industry
John H. Van Deventer, editor of the Iron Age, in his address before the Metallurgical Advisory Board of Carnegie last Friday evening showed that the salvation of the steel industry is for it to become distribution-minded.
The steel industry, according to Mr. Van Deventer, has been in the past a liorrib.le example of inefficient distribution. With the in: crease in demand for steel in 1895 the producers gave all their attention to production and the filling of the orders in sight with little or no thought towards the discovery and development of unseen requirements. When the slump came in 191S it was time to shift the emphasis to merchandising, but the industry, carried along by its twenty-three years of high riding, didnt begin to take notice until this last depression.Research, says Mr. Van Deventer, will be the right arm of the future creative merchandising of the steel industry. By this he means not only industrial research but market research. It has been almost impossible in the past because of lack of detailed information to determine just, which efforts have been profitable. Market analysis, he says, should more accurately define the various supremacy areas of various products for given purposes so that there will be less sales resistance when the product is the most fitting for a certain use. Pressure on the sale of steel where other materials such as wood and concrete are better suited can only do harm to the industry.To escape from profitless selling, says Mr. Van Deventer, no stone must be left unturned. He warmly recommends Mr. A. W. Robertsons movement for the Rehabilitation of the Steel Industry. Now is the time for capital investment in modernization, he says, because machinery manufacturers can af-_ ford to supply time for engineering investigation and shop construction at lesser prices than in all probability the future will permit. The demand for improved products can be met only through the latest developments in methods of 
handling.
Instructor Not Man 
Named In Newspapers
The article that was published last Thursday in all the Pittsburgh newspapers stating that a Carnegie instructor was exonerated by 
a coroners jury in the death of a girl killed while in his auto was a complete misstatement of facts. The man mentioned is not an instructor at Carnegie and the article was a confusion of both name and address. The name of the Carnegie faculty member is J. Cutler Andrews, an instructor in the Department of History whose address is G Olympia Place. He was confused with Homer L. Andrews, 244 Chesterfield Road, who is secretary of Life Underwriters Asso
ciation.

Rollins College 
Asks Students 
To Take Oath
Suidents Must Pledge 
Themselves To Be 
Good Students
Winter Park. Fla.Rollins College, with the opening of its fortyeighth year this month, began the unique custom of asking her students to take a Student Matriculation Oath.
To this end, the first Convocation of the college year was conducted as a dignified academic assembly for the purpose of administering the oath to the entire student body. At the same time, the 
faculty were asked to take a Faculty Installation Oath.
The custom of administering a student oath, officials of Rollins point out, was suggested by the old Athenian Oath taken by youths of Athens upon entering civic life.Hereafter,' President Hamilton Holt announced, the student oath will be taken by all freshmen and new students, while the faculty oath will be taken by new members as they join the teaching staff.
The Student Matriculation Oath follows:I pledge myself to make the Ad; venture of Learning my chief effort while in Rollins College, to seek the guidance and friendship of my instructors, to measure all things by truth.I pledge myself to strive for selfknowledge, self-reverence and selfcontrol, to use wisely the new gift 
of freedom which Rollins has granted me, so that I may make itlie most of liberty without license.I pledge myself to cherish the high ideals and traditions of my Alma Mater as a noble heritage, to transmit them untarnished to those who follow me, and both now and hereafter to honor the name of Rollins among men.The Faculty Oath follows:I pledge myself to seek truth wherever truth is found, to follow truth wherever truth may lead, to teach truth and nothing but the truth.I pledge myself to achieve and hold the mastery of my chosen art or science, breaking paths bravely where I may, following humbly where I must.I pledge myself to be a good comrade to my collegeagues, to do my part cheerfully in all the needs 
of our common endeavor.I pledge myself to accord my students the same courtesy, respect and affection that I crave of them; to do all I can, by precept and example, to help them foster the high idealism of youth.I pledge myself to be loyal to Rollins College and her academic ideals, to abstain from all things that may impair her influence or limit her usefulness; to serve, uphold, honor and exalt her as an independent, Christian College.

Only a very small group was afforded the pleasure of seeing Mr. Orbin enthusiasticallyemulating a good old-fashioned political torchlight parade last Tuesday on the drive betweenthe Arts quadrangle and the Commons. It all came about as the climax to the - first fire the campus has harbored this year. Things started when somebody smelled smoke from an oily mop that had fallen prey to spontaneous cumbustion, in the R. O. T. C. rifle room. The sniffer dashed for Mr. Orbin since he was the nearest man with a ley. Mr. Orbin hastened to the scene attired in his customary derby hat and Hoover Campaign. button. The "fireman save my child episode was performed, and our hero emerged waving the mop overhead.*****
SOCIAL WHIRL
Last week-end saw the campus and adjacent territory agog with activity. Friday night a most successful Mens Dorm dance beamed in Thistle Hall, an Arts sorority country club formal, and a Maggie Murph sorority cellar Halloween dance rounded out the first night festivities. Saturday found the sororities offering a tea dance and a formal as counter attractions to the Billy Weixel football dance and the Phi Psi open house. During the course of the evening at this'last affair we wonder where Frank Sclineller and Will Holloway disappeared to in fish tails.
A very enthusiastic crowd enjoyed the cider and doughnuts furnished at the Dormitory dance. The committee in charge put over a bang up dance and everyone that was present had a big time.
The football dance attracted the usual colorful crowd. Billy Weixels orchestra had an on night and established themselves as the most popular band so far this year. Several members from the Notre Dame band attended in uniform apd lent a certain pre-military ball touch to the affair.

By DAVID CORNMAN
Rarely can it be said that ama
teur acting gives strength to pro
fessional playwriting. In spite of 
what we comfortably label the traditional irregularity of openingnight performances, the aforementioned paradox of the theaters may be found at Carnegie this week.Anne Vroome is the story of a sensitive, but not sentimentalizing, girl. She allows Boyd Holiday, the man she loves and who loves her, to drift from her life, while her own best years crawl by in a small1 town devoid of activity for her, except caring for her parents, who live almost completely in dreams of the past. Ann and Boyd promise to wait for each other. Three years and three months later, after the death of both her parents; Ann goes to her lover in Chicagotoo late. He is to marry a beautiful girl, the very young Sheila Kent. Ann aclcnowl-i edges the hopelessness of her visit, congratulates his fiancee, and leaves. She is free, now, of any obligation. Through her fathers will, she is secure. To what purpose? In a rather odd final scene, we see Ann in a hotel room; she hears the Voices of her Past, jangling, wearisome. Simply, she tells them she is going on, that life is ahead of her, but her words fall short of conviction. They sound too much like unreasoning hope, which Nietzsche calls the beginning of despair.Dorothy Devlin did fine work with the relentlessly noble heroine, who made sacrifices a bit too coolly because "she was that kind of person, thats all. Her reason never is shown any clearer than that. William Roos, as Boyd I-Ialiday, the lover who didnt wait quite long enough, reminded us that it appears more difficult for young men to make unembarrassed 
(stage) love than for maidens of equally tender years. Mr. Roos has poise, but it must be said in his behalf that some of his abashed tones might be forgiven anyone who found, himself saying Mr. Beachs grotesque romantic lines,
which run to . . . you are a sprite strayed from some distant woodland . . . and things like that.Anns father, Withred (Raymond M. Neyhart) was well-drawn, a beloved parasite, placed with confident aged petulance. Dora, his wife, also keenly played, achieved a whiny senescence in Harriette Weiler. Gertrude, a kindly sisterin-law (Henrietta Siskin) held the audience, a truly lovable fool; she appeared as a cross between Zasu Pitts and Beatrice Lillie.Edward Kelly, as the intolerant older brother Fred, who brutally rushed his mothers funeral in order that Ann might not attend it, was convincingly sniffy, smug and hypocritical. Jean Dahl, as an ambitious, self-centered older sister, made good use of pantoriiime in her characterization. Donald Gallagher, as Roderick Dean, friend of Boyds; hadnt much to do but look like a world-weary bachelor, and with enviable, stage presencehe did it;
In spite of earnest work by the cast, the play drags. Its incident 
is continuous, but unsteady, never highly pointed. Mr. Beach presents situations which in themselves are moving, but dulls the edge with mediocre dialogue. In one scene, at Boyds ultra-modern penthouse (technical department please take a well-earned bow) we see a party which looks like the cinema did to the Younger Generation in 1925, at which time this play was brought out. Mj\ Beach has also written a play called The Goose Hangs High about this same Y. G. This work is in wide use as a High School class play. Something 
tells us he should have kept the party scene in that play. It has 
little justification dramatically, and slows the tempo.Scene V.A reunion of Boyd and Anne in her fathers home, after three years separation, goes on for nearly twenty minutes, during at, least half of which time the audience learns nothing it hasn't already figured out for itself. Therefore, an orchid to the players, and to Mr. Beach (Lewis, by the way, not Rex) try again.

One of the most difficult of standards to set up and maintain is that of good usage in English. The employment of language as the vehicle of thought is so varied that differentiating between the good and the bad is troublesome. If the standard is arbitrary, it is unsatisfactory; if it is left to the whim or fancy of the speaker or writer, it may lead to the acceptance of that which is obscure. It is, therefore, not enough to hold as a rule that language has served its purpose, or that you hear it every day, or that you got my meaning. The choice between the correct and the incorrect must bo based on something more definite.
"The circle of the English language, said Sir James Murray, has a well-defined center, but no discernible circumference. This center is made definite by the logic and the science of the grammar. Next to it, of course, is the usage accepted by reputable authors and educated people. Outside of these two defining influences is considerable uncertainty; Probably the best standard obtainable here is that of good taste, an intangible feeling that a use is good or bad. Good taste, for example, would have saved considerable embarrassment to the companions of a prospective feminine golfer who invaded a public links having as part of lier attire liigliheeled shoes. "Here, you, said the ground-keeper, You cant go on to the course with those heels. ?"What's wrong with them? she replied; ones my husband, and the other is my brother.

It is surprising how much better 
a pipe tastes when it is filled with 
tobacco thats made especially for 
pipes. And the Granger package 
is just right, too.

Mechanical Engineers 
Hold Second Meeting
At the second meeting of the 
Carnegie Mechanical Engineering 
Society last Thursday, Prof. S. B. 
Ely and Prof. Willibald Trinks dis
cussed the benefits of joining the 
society as students.
It was explained that the under
classmen are sometimes reluctant 
to attend the meetings and gain 
the full benefit of a program which 
is as valuable to the students as 
any scheduled course in the class
room.
The students were urged to be 
present at the next meeting which 
is to be held in room 10, Machin
ery Hall, Friday at 2:30 p. m. Instructors of fhe Department of Mechanics will permit their groups to attend the meeting at this time. A prominent sales engineer of the Pittsburgh Water Company will speak on some of the less technical aspects of his experience.The meeting of the C.  M. E. S. so far this year have been for the purpose of welcoming sophomores and juniors into the society as members.

The Printing Department is ex
hibiting more than 600 specimens 
of typographical layout in adver
tising design. These specimens 
were submitted for the New York 
Times advertising contest which 
was held recently. The various 
designs were loaned to the Depart
ment of Printing and will be ex
hibited from October 31 to Novem
ber 6.
The purpose of the. contest was 
to stimulate interest in the possi
bilities of small newspaper advertising. It is felt that this medium of attracting public attention is not fully appreciated. Prizes of $100, $50 and $25 were awarded. Among the specimens were several submitted by Carnegie students. Mr. Harry L. Gage of the Mergentlialer Linotype Co. was one of the judges. Mr. Gage was the first head of the Department of Printing.
The specimens, mounted on large beaver-board sheets, are hung in Room 139 Industries. They 
may be viewed by those interested at any time except Wednesday.
