Hong Kong cannot and should not 
xpect to transform China. If it tries to 
!o that, it could risk destroying itself. 
These were words of advice for the 
little British colony from Lord Geoffrey 
owe, former Chancellor of the Exche
quer and Foreign Minister under Mararet Thatcher, as he spoke at GSIA last 
.riday. During Howe's tenure in gov
ernment, he was instrumental in for
malizing the arrangements for the 
jiiandover of Hong Kong to.China in July 
' |as well as in revivingthe British economy 
jn the early eighties. His visit, which 
was arranged and promoted by the In
ternational Business Club, was the lat
st in GSIAs ongoing Distinguished
Speakers Series. The 
event was a coup for 
GSIA, as this was to be 
Howes only'speaking en
gagement in North 
America this year and the 
only time he has ever dis
cussed the issue of Hong 
Kong with an American 
audience.
The bulk of Howes 
speech focused on the fu
ture of Hong Kong, a 
topic of particular inter
est to GSIA students, of 
whom 41 percent are 
from abroad. He did 
touch briefly on issues 
concerning the ongoing 
economic integration of 
the European Union. 
Howe was introduced by Dr. Alan 
Meltzer, university professor of political 
economy, internationally reknowned 
economist and personal friend. The two 
met while Howe was Chancellor of the 
Exchequer in Thatchers cabinet and 
Meltzer was an economic advisor to the 
Reagan administration. As if already 
aware of the instructional quality of the 
speech to come, Meltzer gave the floor to 
the guest speaker with the words, Lord 
Howe, we look forward to hearing what 
you have to teach us.
Opening with a quip about an econo
mist being a person who knows 364 
ways to make love but who doesnt know 
any women, Howe launched into a brief 
history lesson, setting the stage for his 
discussion on Hong Kong.

Student Senate Chair resigns
Senates search for new leader begins
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan News Editor
Citing being burned-out by a 
stressful spring semester as chair, 
Brenden Mielke has announced that 
he is resigning from his duties as 
Student Senate chair, effective Octo
ber 7. Mielke has held office since last 
January and is unsure at this time 
whether he will continue to play any 
role in Senate duties.
Basically its a deci
sion that Ive been 
thinking about all 
summer. Ive tried to 
dowhat I wanted to 
do.... Its a very tough 
organization to work
with internally and ex-------------------
temally. Rather than * 
sit there and let it go to 
hell with me at the helm, its time for 
someone else to get in there and ac
complish their goals, Mielke said.
Its a very bad thing for Senate, 
but probably a good thing for 
Brenden, said Student Senator and 
former Public Relations chair Michael 
Rosenthal, about Mielkes resigna
tion. My sense is that Brenden has. 
poured a lot of work into Senate, and 
its not rewarding because theres not 
any external reaction.
Mielke has been a part of Student 
Senate since the fall of 1994, whenhe 
became a part of the Human Re
sources committee. He then moved
up to chair the Campus Affairs commit
tee, then became chair of the Human 
Resources committee, and has been chair 
of Senate since last January.
Mielkes Senate experience is only one 
of the major concerns regarding his res
ignation; there is also concern about 
finding a willing replacement.
My goal was to have someone ap
pointed Vice [Senate] Chair by Septem
ber 16 in order to smooth the transition,
cj need to step down right now before 
I burn out and do a bad job. 
 Brenden Mielke, 
Student Senate Chair
Mielke said. That didnt happen. No
body in Senate thought they were up to 
it. I really had to sit back and laugh at it. 
Really, [a Senate Chair] only has to run 
meetings and be a voice to the campus 
community.... I think people are scared 
theyre going to make fools of them
selves. I feel the same way every time I 
get up there.
Senate nominated eight or nine people 
and no one wanted it, which is certainly 
an unfortunate statement on things, said 
Rosenthal. According to him, the most 
likely candidate for Senate Vice Chair is 
Catherine Senderling, a masters stu
dent in Public Policy and Management.
Senderling said, Ive pretty much 
decided to accept [the position as Vice 
Chair]. I asked for some more time to 
make sure I wanted to do it. It all 
happened so fast.
If [the person nominated for Vice 
Chair] is the only one nominated, 
theyll be [the Senate Chair], said 
Mielke. It bothers me that theres not 
more interest. If youre ambitious and 
political, this is a golden opportunity.
Im saying this out of 
one side of my mouth, 
and out the other side 
Im running away  
[but] it really bothers 
me that no one wants 
it. I think its person
ally failing on my own 
part because I made it 
seem so large, but 
none of the chair posi
tions are huge.
Rosenthal points out that it is. diffi
cult to be a member of Senate for a 
number of reasons. Its hard to tie 
yourself down to something thats not 
giving anything back ... which is a 
shame, [and] is one of the reasons why 
Student Senate doesnt work. There 
really is no fundamental reason to be 
in Senate because you can make an 
effort but you generally dont see any
thing come of it. Its hard for people to 
work like that, he said.
Actually, theres always new people 
cominginto Senate and just from those

IT dean excited for challenges
By ANNE RAY
Wartan Junior Staffwriter
i| John L. Anderson still isnt 
^accustomed to going to so many
teaching as an assistant professtead of waiting until their 
sor at Cornell University and junior or senior years. In adbecame a professor of chemical dition, he would like to see 
engineering at CMU in 1979. more study-abroad opportuHe also has been the director nities for students. He also 
meetings. When offered the poof the Biomedical Engineeing wants to systematize sumgsition of Dean of CIT last June, 
.^Anderson said he took it because 
fef the challenges and opportu
nities. Between all the time 
pent in conference rooms and 
ian occasional lunch at the 0, 
pie still finds getting to know 
[students personally to be a chal
lenge.
j Its not easy as dean to inter
act. Professors donthave so many 
meetings. My first line of contact 
is the faculty and staff, said 
Anderson. So what Im doing is 
settingup lunches throughoutthe 
year inviting two students from 
each department. Its good for me 
to learn the feelings of the stu
dents. I want them to feel that 
um human and can be ap
proached.
i In 1976, Anderson was an as
sociate professor of chemical enProgram and the head of the 
Chemical Engineering Depart
ment.
Its a challenge to maintain (or 
even improve) the quality of CIT. 
[The position] gives me as a per
son a broader perspective of engi
neering. We have six depart
ments. Ill get to interact with all 
of them  I enjoy that, said 
Anderson.
As dean, Anderson wants to 
broaden the interaction be
tween the departments and the 
colleges by making it easier for 
non-engineers to take engineer
ing courses. One of his first pri
orities is to assess the curricu
lar changes that have been 
made in CIT, such as the rear
rangement of some under
graduate classes. Freshmen 
now take some heavy engineerjgineering at CMU. He spent time ing classes their first year,
mer internships. Anderson 
and Bob Kail, associate dean 
of CIT, are working on a 
project where the process of 
getting a student an intern
ship is done through both the 
career development office and 
CIT, rather than the Univer
sity.
I would like to see more in
ternational experiences for stu
dents. Not many students ask 
for the opportunities. The limi
tation is the matching of cur
riculum, and the language is
sue, said Anderson. But were 
working on that, we think it 
can be done. Its important for 
engineering students to mix 
with students from other cul
tures.

to the ranking sys

The rankings 
arent accurate, he 
said. Each year they 
change the measure. 
The difference be

We decided theres enough 
speeches, this is just a celebra
tion, Vice Provost for Comput
ing Services Alex Hills said as he 
talked among students and staff. 
Last Thursday at 4:30 pm, Com
puting Services sponsored a free 
catered reception to celebrate the 
opening of the newly renovated 
and equipped computer clusters 
in Wean Hall 5200 and Baker 
Hall 140.
The ceremony featured no pre
sentation orkeynote speaker, just 
food. The only signs of flash or 
flourish were placards in each 
cluster displaying names of the 
people who contributed to the 
renovation effort and University 
representatives, who were eager 
to talk to students.
CMU President Robert 
Mehrabian wasin attendance and 
took time out to comment on the 
improvements.
I think its really been out
standing, especially when you
look at the large number of people, 
including students, who were in
volved, said Mehrabian. He also 
addressed the issue of campus 
alterations in general, saying that 
any changes made must be rep
resentative of meeting students 
needs.
We recognize that whatever 
we do (renovations, improve
ments, overhauls, etc.) ... has to 
be in service of our students, 
Mehrabian added.
Junior ECE major Jon 
Burroughs was pretty much 
checking out the food, but also 
remarked on the speed and con
venience of the new Sun Ultras.
Another student remarked on 
the new diversity in the types of 
platforms in Wean 5200. Itsgood 
to have PCs there, said sopho
more Eric Velandia, ECE major. 
Concerning the new Silicon 
Graphics computers, he men
tioned that seeing pictures on the 
Indy Cam was a neat feature, but 
he hasnt seen any video 
conferencing between people.... I 
dont know what else [new] I can
do with them [the SGIs].
The renovations include 30 new 
seats in Baker 140 and 34 in 
Wean 5200. In Baker, the audito
rium has been remodeled into a 
room with 20 PowerMacs. In the 
old rooms, 25 PowerMacs re
placed 20 older Macintoshes and 
25 Dell Pentium PCs replaced 20 
DEC 3100s.
In Wean 5201, 18 Sparc 5s 
replaced 25 HPs, which were 
moved to 5203. In 5202, 21 Sun 
Ultras replaced 31 Sparc 5s. An
other 17 Sun Ultras can be found 
in the partitioned room. Cluster 
Services took over the registars 
classroom, formerly Wean 5205 
and have added 10 SGI Indys. In 
Wean 5207,20 Dell Pentium PCs 
were added.
Both clusters were completely 
renovated, with the biggest 
changes coming in the removal of 
the big glass wall that bordered 
Wean 5202.
While theres a general agree
ment as to the improvement in 
resources at the facilities, some 
users dont like the decor.
Recalling the on-lookers that 
the glass wall in Wean would 
attract, CS staff member Paul 
Mazaitis said, I sorta miss the 
fishbowl effect.
Its very aesthetic, but needs 
more color, said Patty Mackiewicz 
of the Computer Science Depart
ment.
As much as possible, the ad
ministrators tried to deflect the 
credit for the improved facilities. 
Mehrabian said that Alex Hillss 
advisory board was in favor of 
overhaul, while Hills pointed to 
Director of User Services Tracy 
Futhey.
$he really is the leader of the 
project, Hills said.

improved facilities for the stu3ipuSp Spp lNn.REn1 Iu9p 6

Penn State student 
killed by teenage sniper
STATE COLLEGE, Penn., Sept. 20 
i (UPI)A Centre County woman was 
held without bail Friday in connection 
with Tuesdays random sniper attack 
that killed one Penn State student 
and injured another.
Jillian Robbins, 19, was arraigned 
in the death of Melanie Spalla, 21, of 
Altoona; and the wounding of Nicho
las Mensah, 22, of Philadelphia.
Police were unable to establish a 
motive for the shooting and said 
Robbins did not know either stu
dent.
Robbins is charged with one count 
j each of first-degree murder, third-de? gree murder, and five counts each of 
attempted murder and aggravated asrsaulti Prosecutors plan to seek the 
death penalty.
Robbins allegedly fired five shots 
with a high-powered rifle from be
hind some bushes near the Hetzel 
Union Building before she was
wrestled to the ground by a bystander. 
Authorities say she stabbed herself 
in the leg during the struggle and 
underwent surgery for a severed ar
tery Tuesday.
After her release from the hospital 
Friday, Robbins was arraigned by Dis
trict Magistrate Carmine Prestia. 
Common Pleas Judge David Grine 
then ordered her held without bail 
and scheduled a preliminary hearing 
for September 26.
Robbins was taken to Centre County 
Prison for processing. Because the jail 
lacks cells for female inmates, she was 
to be transferred to the Clinton County 
Prison later Friday.
Robbins neighbors have described 
the former Army reservist as a shy 
woman with severe mental problems. 
She was not a student at Penn State, 
but lived in Toftrees, only two miles 
from the sprawling campus of some 
40,000 students.
Former Vice President dies of undiagnosed leukemia
< WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 (Reuter)
'  Former Vice President Spiro Agnew 
1 diedofundiagnosedleukemia, hisfam"ily said in a terse statement released 
Wednesday, one day after he died at a 
hospital in eastern Maryland.
Few details were available on Agnews 
death as his family continued to con
found the news media he once called 
nattering nabobs of negativism. 
Agnew died at age 77 Tuesday at At, lantic General Hospital in Berlin, Mary
land, where officials released a state
ment from his family saying he died of 
,, undiagnosed acute leukemia and that 
A any funeral services would be private. 
The tone and lack of details were in 
keeping with Agnews legacy of defi; ance of the Washington establishment,
;,especially the press, which he battled 
_ during the troubled White House ten
ure of Richard Nixon before his own 
resignationinl973. Republican presi
dential candidate Bob Dole, in a brief 
statement, said Agnew earned the 
support of millions of his countrymen 
. because he was never afraid to speak 
--out and stand up for America.
Some of Agnews denunciations were 
of those demonstrating against the 
. - Vietnam War. His abilities as the ora; tor of the American middle class  he 
! ^called it the silent majority  left a 
*mark on the political landscape durjing the Nixon administration, al
though observers from both ends of 
the political spectrum were skeptical
about how deep his convictions went.
He was elected governor [of Mary
land] as a symbol of clean govern
ment.... Unfortunately, he was on the 
take in Baltimore County, in Mary
land, and probably as vice president, 
said University of Maryland history 
professor emeritus George Callcott.
When a person calls for clean gov
ernment and is asking contractors for 
bribes [as Agnew pleaded no contest to 
doing] one cant escape the note of. 
hypocrisy, Callcott said.
Activist lawyer John Banzhaf of 
George Washington University saw an
other legacy: the principle that ordinary 
citizens may sue political figures who 
take bribes, payoffs, and kickbacks and 
force them to pay back illegal money.
That principle was brought into play 
after Agnew resigned the vice presi
dency  only the second person in 
U.S. history to do so  in 1973, rather 
than stand trial on charges that he 
extorted money while serving as gov
ernor of Maryland in 1967 and 1968. 
He pleaded no contest to tax charges 
and was sentenced to three years pro
bation and fined $10,000.
Ten years after he left office, a state 
court ordered him to repay $268,482 to 
cover the kickbacks. The court found, in 
a civil suit brought by law students at 
George Washington University, that 
Agnew had accepted $147,500 in illegal 
payments and ordered him to repay that 
plus more than $120,000 in interest.
Enemy soldiers 
trapped in Korea
KANGNUNG, South Korea (Reuter)
 South Korean troops using bullhorns 
urged the remnants of a North Korean 
infiltration squad to surrender Friday, 
but there was speculation that the Com
munist agents may have fled and be on 
the way home.
Authorities believe 26 North Koreans 
came ashore from a submarine early 
Wednesday near the east coast city of 
Kangnung.
So far, 18 have been shot and killed 
and one has been captured.
Troops blasted the surrender mes
sage to a half dozen or so agents they 
believed may have holed up in a moun
tain area pitted with abandoned coal 
mines.
Helicopters scattered leaflets urging 
surrender, but by nightfall there was no 
response and a curfew was imposed un
til dawn.
There was even speculation that the 
highly trained operativesmay have slipped 
through a cordon of thousands of troops 
and police and could be on their way 
home. You are surrounded. Ifyou aban
don your weapons and surrender you 
can live. Most of your colleagues have 
been shot to death. We urge you to 
surrender immediately, an army of
ficer shouted through a bullhorn on a 
military jeep.
Political shockwaves from the inci
dent one of the deadliest infiltrations 
of the South since the early Cold War 
spread wider, clouding prospects for a 
U.S.-South-Korean peace initiative for 
the divided Korean peninsula.
North and South Korea have been 
technically at war since their 1950-53 
conflict ended with an armistice negoti
ated by U.S.-led United Nations forces.
On Thursday in Washington, Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher urged 
all parties to avoid further provocative 
action. Seoul said it would brief the U.N. 
Security Council on the drama and Ja
pan denounced the incident as deplor
able.
North Korea accused South Korea of 
takingprovocative action near the bor
der earlier this week but made no refer
ence to the submarine incident in a 
radio broadcast.
Christopher told a news conference: 
We wish that all parties would refrain 
from takingfurther provocative actions.
The United States has 37,000 troops 
stationed in the South to deter any North 
Korean attack.
Japan hit out at its close neighbor 
across the sea.
We have an interest in peace and 
stability on the Korean peninsula and it 
is deplorable that North Korea has 
brought about this incident, govern
ment spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said 
in a news conference.
The international community will not 
accept it. We call on North Korea to
immediately end these kinds of actions.
Political analysts said the incident may 
have damaged the chances of peace on 
the Korean peninsula by giving ammu
nition to hard-liners in Seoul, who op
pose any concessions to the North.
South Korea and the United States 
are trying to entice Pyongyang to talks, 
along with China, to work out a peace 
pact to replace the armistice.
A South Korean Foreign Ministry state
ment said Seouls ambassador to the 
United Nations would brief members of 
the Security Council later Friday.
The infiltration was an obvious viola
tion of the armistice agreement and a 
grave threat to peace and security on the 
' Korean peninsula, the statement said.
South Korea is one of 15 members of 
the Security Council, whose permanent 
members are the United States, China, 
Russia, Britain, and France.
Media reports said the captured man 
told interrogators 26 North Koreans 
landed. Three were saboteurs  
trained to survive behind enemy lines 
and cover huge distances on foot  
and they were still at large, Lee Kwangsoo said.
South Koreas spy chief said the sabo
teurs could have murdered 11 of their 
colleagues, whose bodies were found on 
top of a mountain Wednesday. At the 
time, authorities said they had commit
ted suicide rather than risk capture.
Kwon Young-hae, the director of the 
Agency for National Security Planning, 
was quoted by newspapers as telling a 
parliamentary committee some of the 11 
were killed by bullets fired from behind, 
suggesting execution-style death.
Security experts suggested the sabo
teurs sacrificed their comrades in order 
to move faster and to distract pursuers.
The infiltrators appeared to have been 
sent not for simple espionage or recon
naissance missions but for special du
ties such as guerilla warfare, Kwon 
said.
Inicase they evaded the dragnet around 
the mines, troops were lying in ambush 
along roads and mountain passes lead
ing to North Korea, a Defense Ministry 
official in Kangnung said.
Mother Teresa 
recovers from fall
CALCUTTA, India (Reuter)Mother 
Teresa, recovering from an injury to her 
head suffered in a fall, is expected to 
leave the hospital soon, said doctors 
treating the Roman Catholic mission
ary Saturday.
We must have another CAT [brain] 
scan Monday before we release her Tues
day, said Dr. S.K. Sen, medical director 
of Woodlands Nursing Home.
The 86-year-old nun was admitted to 
hospital Monday after falling from a 
chair and injuring her head. A brain 
scan later showed an apparent spot on 
her brain.
Doctors have said they do not believe 
the unexplained spot is cause for worry,
but want to conduct another scan to 
determine if it stemmed from an old 
injury.
Sen said the revered missionary 
showed no signs of suffering from the 
head injury. She is significantly better 
now and there is no neurological deficit, 
he said.
Mother Teresa remains bright and 
cheerful. But she will be under observa
tion for a few more days, a medical 
bulletin issued by the hospital said.
Mother Teresa expressed her desire 
Friday to visit Rome and meet Pope 
John Paul II to wish him good health.
She needs lots of rest and she is not in 
a position to fly to Rome, said Dr. A.K 
Bardhan, the personal cardiologist of 
the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The missionary, known as the Saint 
of the Gutter for her devotion to the 
poor and destitute, was admitted to the 
same nursing home Aug. 20 with heart 
trouble, malaria, and pneumonia.
She was released 18 days later and 
told to rest.
First female chain 
gang hits street
PHOENIX (Reuter)  America's first 
female chain gang hit Phonix streets, 
drawing curious glances from passersby and protests from prisoners rights 
groups.
Clad in bright orange jumpsuits and 
caps, 15 shackled women prisoners were 
taken from their jail cells and put to 
work cleaning up a rundown area of 
downtown Phoenix.
The gangs are the idea of Maricopa 
County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who intro
duced male chain gangs a year ago and 
says women inmates should get equal 
treatment.
Why should they be any differ
ent? Arpaio said. Im an equal op
portunity incarcerator.
The women are to spend-th next 30 
days digging up weeds, raking lots, and 
collecting trash for eight hours a day 
under the watchful eyes of county deten
tion officers.
A handful of protesters ijearby carried 
signs reading: Prisoners should not be 
exploited for Joe Arpaios ego.
The only reason Im doing this is to 
get out of lock-down, said inmate Dana 
Stanley, 29, pausing for a drink of water. 
This isnt going to help me at all, or 
anyone else.

Carnegie Almanac
From National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, Oct. 29,1946: 
The CIT radio station WCIT was 
established to start campus 
broadcasts. The station was to 
begin broadcasting at 12:45 pm 
on Thursday, October 31, 1946. 
Operating through the 
Universitys network of 
powerlines from the studio in the 
Fine Arts building, it could be 
received at 900 AM on the dial of 
any radio receiver in the build
ings on campus. The barracks 
and fraternity houses were not 
connected to this network.
The organizers of the project 
planned to hold two half-hour 
tests daily, starting at 12:45 pm 
and 7:00 pm. The noon program 
consisted of popular recordings, 
while light music, such as Gilbert 
and Sullivan, musical comedies, 
and semi-classical works filled 
the evening broadcast.
Preliminary plans included four 
to five hours of daily broadcast
ing, including newscasts, skits, 
sports coverage, and guest speak
ers. The technical issues were 
primarily handled by the CIT 
Radio Club, which had existed 
for several years previous. The 
broadcasts were made possible
by using the powerlines as anten
nas. By keeping the power low, 
radiation was kept at a minimum 
and the station did not require a 
license from the FCC.
25 YEARS AGO, Oct. 7,1971: 
Evening school at CMU ended, as 
curriculums leading to a diploma 
were set to discontinue in June of 
1973. The principle reason for 
phasing out the night program 
was the declining part-time en
rollment in the evening school. 
The program once boasted over 
1000 students, but that number 
had dropped to 400 when the 
announcement was made.
The decline was directly related 
to the University of Pittsburghs 
offered evening courses, which 
were offered at $12 a unit; com
pared to $26 per unit here.
For regular full-time students, 
the phase-out effectively meant 
that class hours could be extended 
into the 4:30 to 10:30 pm time 
period that evening school occu
pied.
10 YEARS AGO, Sept. 30, 
1986: Student Senate debated how 
to spend a $64,285 surplus that
was discovered by the Funding 
and Recognition Co-Chair. The CoChair had found the surplus in 
November of the previous year, 
but wasnt sure exactly how much 
it was or how to allocate it. Sen
ate was told by the administra
tion that because of the surplus, 
Senate should not assume that 
the University would pick up cer
tain costs that students petition 
for. Administrators also advised 
Senate to invest some of the money 
in an interest-bearing account.
The final decision was to use

school year and to invest the rest 
in a high return, low liquidity 
account.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Sept. 23, 
1991: A study designed by a CMU 
professor showed a link between 
stress and the common cold. 
What we have is basically a link 
between stress and susceptibil
ity, said CMU psychologist 
Sheldon Cohen. The study, con
ducted at Medical Research 
Councils Common Cold Unit in 
Salisbury, United Kingdom, uti
lized 394 volunteers. The volun
teers completed questionaires
regarding psychological stress 
and then were exposed to either a 
harmless salt solution, or a virus.
Cohens results showed that 74 
percent of least stressed sub
jects were infected, and 27 per
cent experienced cold symptoms. 
For heavily stressed subjects 
the numbers jumped to 90 per
cent for infection and 47 percent 
for symptoms.
ONE YEAR AGO, Sept. 25, 
1995: Scotland Yard re-opened on 
campus, a few days late and with 
minor glitches. The Yard was open 
nightly 8 pm to 2 am. In addition 
to a vegetable plate, hummus, and 
pita, hot foods such as nachos, hot 
dogs, baked pretzels, and cheese 
sticks were served. Initially hot 
food was served only until 10:30 
pm, but the serving period was 
later extended until midnight.
However, when the hot food 
stopped, the much-loved des
serts were still available. The 
selection of gourmet brewed 
coffees also returned for a sec
ond year.

It is a quite unique society, he said 
of the little colony whose 99-year lease 
to Britain expires on July 31,1997. [It 
is] a uniquely successful child of a mar
riage between two distinct cultures  
the best of Britain and the best of China, 
he said. Howe briefly described Hong 
Kongs importance in the business 
world, concluding that it is, Probably 
the most liberal economy in the world. 
The tiny colony is the home of the worlds 
largest container harbor, the eighth 
largest stock market, and over 400 in
ternational banking institutions. Howe 
commended China on not taking the 
colony by force, something he feels it 
could have done at any time before the 
expiration of the lease agreement, in 
spite of Hong Kongs position as a feed
ing ground for ideological condemna
tion of the Peoples Republic.
Howe became foreign minister in 1983, 
six months after Margaret Thatchers 
visit to Beijing formally initiated the 
handover negotiations. Of the lengthy
and often times precarious discussions, 
which culminated in a 57-page docu
ment known as The Joint Declaration, 
Howe said, I likened the negotiations to 
a relay race where we were passing not 
a baton, but a Ming Vase.
Despite the sensitivity of the situa
tion, Howe felt that negotiations be
tween Britain and China proceeded 
smoothly until the massacre in 
Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
Tiananmen Square was a result of 
growing fear among the Chinese middle 
class. Howe visited Hong Kong barely 
three weeks after Tiananmen Square, 
saying of his trip, I went to Hong Kong 
as something of a human lightening 
conductor.
Howe is confident that the transition 
from British to Chinese rule will be a 
smooth one and that the Chinese will 
abide by Deng Xiaopings idea of One 
country, two systems. He said, I be
lieve that the essential economic vital
ity of Hong Kong will survive. How
ever, he added this would depend on the
outside world doing its part. We need 
to keep up constructive engagement 
[with the Chinese].... We must reactvto 
human rights abuses.... We should never 
cease to believe that Hong Kongs 
progress will depend on the continua
tion of the rule of law.
Lord Howe has had an unique part
nership with history. He studied law it 
Cambridge University, served with the 
British Army in East Africa during 
World War II, and served as a cabinet 
member under the premiership of E&: 
ward Heath before serving under Mar1 
garet Thatcher.
As a man who has spent most of his 
life makinghistory or being inextrica
bly tied to it, he certainly felt he had 
earned the right to make one lait 
cautionary note to his audience an 
Friday.
It is interesting to look at history 
as a series of accidents  the most 
tragic events in history almost in
variably are. That is why we have 6

dents to use [sic], Futhey said. Weve 
seen the demand grow in the past few 
years.... Its nice to see the administra
tion support it (the improvements).
While there seems to be general agree
ment that Computing Services has in
creased the number of computers avail
able to students and improved the qual
ity of facilities for teaching use, Futhey 
stressed that the upgrade initiative is 
not complete.
At this time there are no definite 
plans for further cluster expansion or 
renovation. However, Computing Ser
vices is actively monitoring usage in 
the clusters to determine how well 
CMUs current facilities are meeting 
student and class demands. Theyll con
tinue to monitor the clusters for several 
more weeks before making any judg
ment on whether our current facili
ties adequately meet that demand. 
Until Computing Services completes 
that evaluation,it does not really know 
whether theres need for additional 
computers .or further renovation of 
facilities. Since the start of the se
mester, a very high use of clusters 
has registered, but historically the 
first few weeks of the semester have 
been found to be one of the three peak 
periods.
Its important for us to weigh that 
peak usage level against the extent to 
which cluster use is likely to trail off 
in the coming month, Futhey said. 
Well be monitoring use and relying 
on faculty and students to provide us 
with feedback. To make suggestions 
for cluster upgrading, email

it depends on who his replacement is. 
Regardless who it is, Im resigning. That

Its difficult where Brenden is con

Skibo spirit should 
become the rule
[The stands were packed and those 
who couldnt find seats made do 
with standing or squatting on the 
dank grass. There were posters and 
flyers and towels twirling in the 
night air. People were banging on 
pots and blowing horns and scream
ing themselves hoarse. There were 
pointed faces and painted bodies 
and crazy hats and a myriad other 
wprys of telling the team battling 
oiit on the field that the fans were 
behind them all the way.
University of Pittsburgh? Sun 
Djsvil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona? 
Michigan? Nebraska? Wrong.
This unprecedented display of of 
enthusiasm took place on Saturday 
night at CMUs own Gesling Sta
dium as the Tartans squeezed out a 
la|st-gasp victory over Grove City 
Cbllege. Spirit is back at Carnegie 
Mellon, and its been a long time 
ccjming.
'Over the last few years there have 
been several attempts at bringing 
spirit back to this school. Theyve 
ringed from the end-of-semester fes
tivals to University Forum discus
sions to the continuing efforts of 
admissions and orientation to build 
aiid maintain dynamism in each 
freshman class. For the most part, 
tljese efforts have all contributed 
tdwards taming the beast of apathy 
and disinterest on this campus.
;But the traditional measure of 
school spirit has always been the 
way in which the school cheers its 
competitors on. For whatever rea
son, that usually means roaring 
when the home team shoves that
ball cross that line, and yelling 
vulgar invective whenever the visi
tors do anything of any worth or the 
ref. makes a bad call.
That happened on Saturday night. 
That happened almost entirely be
cause a group called Spirit of Skibo 
decided it would. It was the only 
way; an organization needed to grab 
the beast by the horns and wrestle it 
to the ground. On Saturday night, 
2,431 CMU fans werent just cheer
ing the Tartans on, they were also 
kicking and pounding and beating 
the living shit out of that apathy 
beast and telling it to SIT!
There is one vital detail left, and 
that is to ensure that Saturdays 
boisterous crowd and its spirit be
comes the rule and not the excep
tion. The atmosphere of a real home 
field needs to be established before 
the weather starts to take its toll on 
attendance. Visiting teams need to 
start having to factor the crowd into 
their game plans when they play 
here; they need to say, theyve got 
that new beast living at Gesling and 
its got like 2,400 heads or some
thing.
If Saturdays energy can be main
tained, it will inevitably spill over to 
our soccer games, volleyball games, 
track meets, swim meets, robotics 
competitions, art exhibitions, finan
cial games, and every other field 
where CMU students take on the 
bad guys.
The Tartans next home game is 
Saturday, September the 28th at 
1:30pm. Well see you there. Bring it
Escort, SafeWalk 
should be utilized
As the statistics published by the 
Carnegie Mellon Police Department 
indicate, there are few violent crimes 
occurring on campus. Despite this 
f^ct, students should still be wary of 
travelling across campus and around 
the community after daylight hours.
For this reason, several options 
for late-night travel (or early morn
ing travel, as the case may be) exist 
for the CMU community.
For off-campus travels, Campus 
Police runs an Escort shuttle ser
vice, which drives members of the 
CMU community from designated 
campus pick-up locations to off cam
pus locations. Although Escort runs 
from 6 pm to 6 am every day of the 
week, using the service sometimes 
comes with the expense of having to 
wait 15-20 minutes for the Escort 
shuttle to make it through its drop
off route. On busy nights and week
ends, wait times might be as much 
as a half hour.
Very often, students will forgo us
ing this service because that seem
ingly slight wait means less sleep, 
or less time to finish up some class 
assignments.
For campus residents, there is 
SpfeWalk, an extremely dedicated 
and important student-run group 
that provides paired chaperones for 
students, staff and faculty from 10 
pm til 2 am. This service exclusive 
to on-campus residences, and is not 
available for CMU residents in Ca
thedral Mansions, Webster Hall, and 
Fairfax.
^These services are both very im
portant and necessary to the safety 
aftd peace of mind of both onand 
off-campus residents. However, the 
SafeWalks and Escorts impacts are 
gfeatly diminished if students do 
not or cannot use them. If students 
choose not to call either service be
fore venturing out, or worse, do not

On behalf of the 
Carnegie Mellon 
University football 
team, I would like 
to thank the cam
pus community for 
the great support 
it gave us during our game with Grove 
City College at GesUng Stadium this 
past Saturday night.
My affiliation with the Tartans foot
ball program extends over 20 years, and
I am hard-pressed to recall a more vocal 
or inspiring crowd than the one we had 
this past weekend.
It was a great feeling for players and 
coaches alike to look up into the stands 
and see all those people cheering us on.
A special thanks must be extended to 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student Af
fairs, whose distribution of colored tow
els created a truly exciting atmosphere.
We really had a home field advan
tage Saturday night, and I think the 
crowd was a big reason we pulled the 
game out in the end.
Our players take great pride in the 
success of our football program and they
appreciate it when the campus rallies 
behind them.
It lets them know they are playing not 
just for themselves but for the entire 
Carnegie Mellon community.
I look forward to seeing another greal 
crowd in Gesling this Saturday when we 
play Rhodes College at 1:30pm.
Again, thanks to all who made our 
game with Grove City a special night.

know how to use the services, they 
are putting themselves at risk, and 
the two programs cannot fulfill their 
goals of protecting.
For that reason, both programs 
should better publicize their pro
grams and the protocol that the pro
grams use for service.
For Escort, this means postering 
and indicating where to call for a 
ride, or where to wait to assure 
being picked up. Perhaps the Escort 
service could install bus-stop signs 
where common stops are made, and 
in the vicinity of emergency call 
boxes.
Furthermore, all students and 
staff should be made aware of ex
actly what to do in order to get a safe 
ride home form escort; there are 
many students here that arent even 
aware of what Escort is.
As for SafeWalk, their service 
needs only to be expanded, even 
though the constraints of being a 
student-run organization may hamper such growth. Specifically, 
SafeWalk should serve the several 
complexes that house CMU resi
dents (Cathedral Mansions, Webster 
Hall, and Fairfax).
The walk is not very long, but does 
present a potential danger. In addi
tion, SafeWalk should expand its 
operating hours until at least 4 am. 
It is far from uncommon for a stu
dent or faculty member to be hard at 
work late in to the morning hours, 
and these individuals could certainly 
benefit from the Peace of Mind 
SafeWalk has to offer.
Both programs are to be lauded 
for the service they provide the com
munity. However, their services 
must be easily accessible to the 
members of the community if they 
are to be effective.

Public school problems raise concerns
S
Jon Orris
For the first ar
ticle in my series 
on public educa
tion, Id like to ex
amine an event 
that I think clearly 
suggests the cur
rent direction the
system is headed in today. This incident occurred at J.T. 
Lambert Intermediate School in East Stroudsberg, 
Pennsylvannia.
Fifty-nine girls, aged 11 tol2, were taken into a bare 
room. They were ordered to strip down to their panties and 
line up. They were then informed that the physician would 
be performing a genital exam on them. The exam to be 
performed was not a mere cursory external exam, but a full 
internal gynecological exam to look for lesions and warts 
and evidence of sexually transmitted disease. The infor
mation and permission slips sent home to parents didnt 
bother to mention this.
Many of the girls became upset upon hearing of the 
exam. Many of their parents had already sent their slips 
in with No checked, refusing the let their children be 
examined. Those who asked to call their parents, asserting 
that they would object, were not given the opportunity and 
were told that even if the parents objected, it wouldnt 
matter. Those who objected further, saying that they 
didnt want such an exam, were told too bad.
According to the parents of one girl who objected to the 
exam, she was held down and had her legs forced apart. 
Another was so upset afterwards that she couldnt even 
tell her parents until she had taken a long, hot shower. She 
still wakes up from nightmares screaming, But I said no! 
The doctor who performed the exam has strenuously 
defended her actions, saying that the exams were in the 
girls best interests. Yes, I said her. The doctor was a 
woman. One would think she would know better, as if 
there would be any excuse for a male doctor, or even your 
average fungus, to be this overwhelmingly stupid.
The school district later conceded that the purpose of the
exam was not only to look for evidence of STDs, unlikely in 
11-year-old girls, but also to look for evidence of sexual 
abuse by the parents, which explains why the parental 
notice didnt mention a gynecological exam. The school 
district has defended its actions, asserting that the exams 
were perfectly OK, within state health rules, and that no 
impropriety occurred. The Pennsylvania State Police an
nounced that there was no criminal conduct, and that their 
investigation is closed.
Any private citizen who committed acts like this would be 
sent to jail and, considering how many prisoners feel about 
child molesters, probably painfully killed. But this was 
govemment-sactioned. That isr where many concerns lie.
The Pennsylvania branch of the NEA announced its 
support of the doctors actions and believes-that such inschool exams should be conducted. Teachers across Penn
sylvania wore blue ribbons to show that they supported the 
exams. Im sure that it was a great comfort to the little girl 
who still wakes up screaming to see this. Think about your 
own children, current or future.
You, as a parent, are forced by law to sencLyour child to 
school until they are 18. Money is requested from you to pay 
for the public schools where you must send your children if 
you cant afford private schooling, and, as the Stroudsberg 
school district and the state of Pennsylvania have made 
abundantly clear, if your daughter is gynelogically exam
ined by school officials, you have no right to speak out, no 
right to complain. The matter is none of your damn busi
ness. This is reality. This is Hillarys global village.
This is the compassion and concern for children that 
the liberals espouse. Things such as mandatory in-school 
medical exams are mandated by Goals 2000 (of the Clinton 
administrations series of future efforts). Your only purpose 
as a parent is to provide the money and get the hell out of 
their way.
If this is what you want, please, go ahead and vote for 
Clinton. Go ahead and support public education. You de
serve the results.

U.S. attack on Iraq suggests debacle
if I really want to know the facts.
Let me give you the low-down. The 
Clinton administration, in another of its 
series of foreign policy blunders, decided 
James Stepanek to support a certain band of Kurdish
support. Well, I suppose the cruise mis
siles fired into southern Iraq, even 
though the Kurds are hundreds of miles 
north, could be considered a token.

Now I know most CMU students are

all heard about the current situation

ago, the U.S. launched 
a cruise-missile attack 
against Iraq and ex
panded the No Fly 
Zone. Saddam Hussein 
thumped his chest a bit 
about this and just let it

This is not exactly how the news has 
reported it. They initially reported the 
great U.S. success against Iraq and how 
were helping out the poor Kurds. Well, 
that isnt quite the whole truth. Then 
again, Ive learned to look a bit more 
deeply than the surface of news reports

Hussein. Now this sounds pretty good in 
theory, right? Well, it might have been if 
they hadnt chosen a group that was

Then, as if picking the side supported by 
the only bunch in the Middle East, worse 
than Iraq wasnt bad enough, we let the 
other group of Kurds, who are supported 
by Hussein, stomp our guys out of exist

supplied by the U.S. to overthrow Castro. 
Of course when push came to shove, 
Kennedy backed out of supporting them 
to the hilt, and they got massacred. 
This is exactly what happened to these 
Kurds. We got them to trust 
us and set them up to do dirty 
work that we didnt want to 
do. Then, when things turned 
bad, <we turned tail and ran, 
abandoning our erstwhile al

their sadistic enemies. Boy, I 
bet that will really inspire 
the world to trust Uncle Sam 
in the future.
Now, regarding the re
sponse we managed to make: 
We sent in a couple of waves of cruise 
missiles to hit Iraqi air defenses and 
expanded the No Fly Zone.
Of course, as I said, this expansion 
was in the south, nowhere near the butch

hour, every seat in the theater 
was filled, and everybody 
cheered at the end.
They also cheered at various 
points during the movie, in
cluding the end of Bill 
Pullmans mega-cornball To
day we celebrate our Indepen
dence Day speech. And when 
a totally off-his-rocker Randy 
Quaid sacrifices himself for his 
cause. And when the president, 
in a bizarre----------------------------
ing movie stereotype since Jimmy 
Stewarts maid in Its a Wonder
ful Life.
Then theres Harvey Fierstein 
as the comically gay sidekick, 
whose every line draws a laugh 
simply because he sounds like 
such a pansy when he says it.
Bob Dole complimented this 
film on its pro-American themes. 
Of course its pro-American.
Look at the Iraqi army: sitting 
in the desert, waiting for the he
roic Americans to come up with a 
plan to save their hides. (They 
are, thankfully, kept in check by 
the British army; otherwise who 
knows how those Middle-Eastemers might start wantonly de
stroying people?)
Now, I liked the first 30 or 40 
minutes of this movie. Seeing civi
lization as I know it get annihi
lated was pretty scary. But then
The reason for my rant is that every
body in my theater went nuts over this 
movie.... Do they go see it for the proAmerican message, or the obscenely 
expensive visual effects..."
and vindic
tive tirade, 
fires his 
secretary 
of state for 
making 
some kind 
of outland
ish, insubordinate 
suggestion ... , 
like, I 
dont think
you should fight the aliens per
sonally, Mr. President.
Perhaps I need to loosen up, 
but when I was watching this 
movie, I couldnt help but won
der whether anybody (charac
ters or audience members) was 
upset that just about every 
major city in the country had 
been destroyed.
Oh sure, me and my family 
were fried, but that didnt 
matter, because the survivors 
had found a way to destroy the 
aliens. And for all its political 
correctness (the AfricanAmerican and the Jew coming 
together to save the day), Inthey put those humans into the 
mix, and the movie started to go 
downhill.
Why is Jeff Goldblum the only 
person in the world who under
stands whats going on?
And isnt it lucky for us that he 
had a fortuitious romantic con
nection to the White House.
Isnt it lucky, also, that the gov
ernment was covering up a 30- 
year-old UFO in a secret, multi
billion dollar, underground re
search facility. (Another govern
ment cover-up; how pro-Americanis that?)
And then the president of the 
United States, who hasnt taken 
dependence Day is a tad offenmuch time to mourn the death of
sive. Look at the Judd Hirsch 
character: a ranting, babbling, 
heavily accented rabbiwannabe, straight off the bus 
from the Lower East Side.
This guy is the most insulthis wife,- actually hops into a 
fighter jet and goes up there to 
personally destroy the evil alien 
invaders. Come on!
The reason for my rant is that 
everybody in my theater went
nuts over this movie. They 
couldnt get enough. It made 
$100 million in six days, or 
something ridiculous like that.
A friend of mine said he 
thought it was one of the best 
movies hed ever seen.
Why do people love this 
movie? Do they go see it for the 
pro-American message, or the 
obscenely expensive visual ef
fects (which are only slightly 
better than Close 
Encounters or Alien), or the 
promise of cool action se
quences and horrible, bloody 
deaths? Or is it something 
about aliens? (The Arrival was 
the summers other alien flick, 
and Men in Black and Robert 
Heinleins Starship Troopers 
are in production.)
Im not sure. All I know is, I 
went to see this movie because
------------- a friend of
mine was in 
L.A. for seven 
days and he 
wantedtosee 
abig-budget, 
big-action, 
big-noise 
movie in a big 
theatre. (We 
went to the 
 Fox theatre 
in Westwood, 
which seats 
some 1,100 people.)
Neither ofus especially liked 
the movie. Looking back on it, 
that fact seems somehow irrel
evant.
We went for the idea of the 
movie, rather than the movie 
itself.
And I suppose theres some
thing wrong with that, and, if 
I stopped to think about it, Id 
probably be unhappy with 
myself and all I beleive.
But I dont have time for 
that; I have to confirm my yearin-advance ticket reservations 
for Alien 4: the Resurrection.

,TTT Clinton has turned 
US foreign policy into 
the laughingstock of 
the entire world.
The north had already been 
covered by the No Fly Zone im
posed by President Bush and the 
U.N. after the Gulf War.
The forty-something missiles 
launched targeted air defense 
sites in Iraq.
Battle damage assessment has 
shown that the effectiveness of 
this was rather unimpressive.
Of course, this act had no effect 
whatsoever on the events that 
sparked the whole confrontation. 
It was a paper tiger, set up incor
rectly and executed poorly. Then 
again, when did Clinton ever ac
tually do something useful rather 
than showy?
In fact, the very nature of this
sham _________________
seems to 
have been 
so appar
ent to the 
rest of the 
world 
that w'e 
are get
ting no in~    -
ternational support. I, for one, am not 
really that concerned about in
ternational support in most cases, 
but when even the nations that 
would ordinarily be eager allies 
in a situation are edging away 
from supporting you, there must 
be something wrong. The image 
of rats scuttling from the wrack is 
wrong in this case. We may be the 
wrack, but there are no rats, just 
intelligent people lowering the 
lifeboats. Lets consider Clintons 
actions for a moment, shall we?
Do you think it could be the fact 
that this whole action comes 
across as a blatant election ploy 
to make Clinton look as if hes 
had a firm foreign policy?
Thats what the international 
press seems to think. Funny thing 
is, I agree. This would seem like 
a last minute effort to express 
some sort of action-oriented ad
ministration while he still has a 
little bit of time.
The Middle East is a touchy 
place. Meddling is dangerous, to 
say the least, because of its his
tory and traditions.
They are very sensitive about 
their sovereignty and the image 
of teaming up with westerners 
against their Arab brethren.
This unexpected and sponta
neous action by Clinton and com
pany was not even inn past our 
allies in the region. In fact, the 
Arab League, once our allies in 
the Gulf War, have come out 
against this action of ours.
Clinton also wanted to send in 
more ground troops to the region 
to be stationed in Kuwait.
Even the Kuwaitis balked at 
this. Then again, youd be a little 
upset, too, if you found out from 
CNN reports that someone was 
sending troops to your country. 
Doesnt it say something when 
the nation most likely to be in 
danger doesnt want your troops 
present?
____________________You see,
the justifi
cation for 
the whole 
business is 
that the 
No Fly 
Zone and 
zones in 
___which the 
Kurds are
meant to be secure are mandated 
by the United Nations.
A humorous angle of this situ
ation is that Clinton didnt even 
consult with the U.N. about the 
attacks, and in fact most of the 
nations represented in the U.N. 
have not really shown approval.
So what we see here is another 
example of how Clinton has 
turned U.S. foreign policy into 
the laughingstock of the entire 
world. Everyone is looking at us: 
think about that.
We support a group to over
throw someone, but leave them 
in the lurch when it counts. We 
strike back in an inappropriate 
and ineffective manner.
Then, we try to escalate the 
situation, even in the face of our 
allies reminding us that were 
not accomplishing anything.
Anyone who could perceive this 
situation as anything other than 
Clinton shamelessly trying to look 
tough on foreign policy really 
doesnt grasp reality.

Mike Averbuch
You may have wondered why many 
people didnt show up for classes today. It 
wasnt a mass-skip day or a protest: It was 
Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for 
Jews. Yom Kippur is the last day of the 
Days of Awe, an eight-day period from 
Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur.
Rosh Hashanah is the start of the Jew
ish new year. According to the Jewish 
calendar, Rosh Hashanah is the. first day 
of the month of Tishrei. This year, Tishrei 
1, 5757 happened to land on Saturday,
September 14,1996. On Rosh Hashanah, 
Jews celebrate the closing of the previous 
year and welcome a new one. It is much 
like the civil New Years Day with an 
added religious aspect.
A shofar, an trumpet-instrument made 
from a rams horn, is sounded to symboli
cally wake people from slumber and re
mind people of the days holiness (para
phrased from Proverbs 31:30).
Incidentally, Rosh Hashanah landed on 
Shabbat (the Sabbath) this year, so the 
day was extra holy.
However, the holiest day for Jews is 
Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance. On 
that day, we abstain from worldly plea
sure, including food andmarital relations. 
While fasting, we are commanded to re
flect on the past year and pray for forgive
ness of transgressions against G-d. That is
only half of our job, however.
We must also ask for forgiveness for 
misdeeds against fellow humans.
According to Jewish law, the only way to 
be forgiven for doing wrong to another 
person is to truly feel sorry about the 
offense and ask forgiveness of the person, 
not G-d. True forgiveness also entails not 
repeating that transgression.
As the new school year kicks into full 
steam, Jews and non-Jews alike should 
take this advice to heart and forgive each 
other for wrongdoing, not just pray that 
the pain will go away.
This is the key to Yom Kippur, and the 
center of repentance.
Both forgiving and being forgiven help 
keep friendships strong and relationships 
blossoming.
Besides, it gives warm and fuzzy feel
ings to all involved.
Lets make the most of the new year. 
Meet new people.
Raise your QPA. Go to a party or two. 
Eat an extra ice-cream cone in High
lander.
Enjoy the best in life.
Try your best to have fun! As long as 
you keep the consequences of your ac
tions in mind, you are pretty much free to 
do anything you choose.
As a freshman, Im just beginning to 
appreciate the freedom college students 
have; I intend to make the most of it. I am 
looking forward to it.
Have a safe and joyous year.

ics major. He welcomes any responsible

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  23 September 1996Kickers win NFL games, lose key matchups
From the Goal Line
by Ronak Singhal
Every city has its own sports 
villain. For some, it is an oppos
ing athlete like Joe Carter in 
Philadelphia or Francisco 
'Cabrera here in Pittsburgh. In 
isome cities, its an owner like 
; Art Modell in Cleveland, while 
in others, the towns own ath
letes have become its greatest 
villains. Such is the case with 
Lin Elliot in Kansas City and 
Scott Norwood in Buffalo. And 
that is the life of a kicker; a 
player who gets little, notice 
when his team is playing well, 
but who can often be the scape
goat remembered for blowing 
1 the opportunity of a lifetime for 
'52 other people.
Take Norwood for example. Can 
[you name the kicker for all the 
; Denver Broncos teams that lost 
Super Bowls during the 80s? For 
most people, the answer to that is 
no. (It was Rich The Bare-footed 
Karlis, by the way). But if asked 
to name the kicker for the Bills 
when they lost to the Giants, most 
half-knowledgeable football fans 
will know the name of Scott 
Norwood.
For those who dont remember 
what I am talking about, Norwood 
missed a field goal at the end of 
the Super Bowl that would have 
given the Bills a victory over the 
Giants in the Super Bowl. In
stead, Norwoods kick was wide, 
and the Bills and the AFC as a 
whole have continued to act as 
doormats for their NFC oppo
nents. Who knows how football 
history would have changed had 
that kick been good. Of course, 
soon after that debacle, Norwood 
lost his job in Buffalo, and the

discounts 
on domestic
Bills have never come close to 
winning the Super Bowl again.
Last year, the Kansas City 
Chiefs were the most dominant 
team in the AFC. They were 
undefeated in their division and 
had an overall record of 13-3. 
Yet, they could not even get to 
the AFC championship game. 
Who was the scapegoat for 
the Chiefs in that game?
Was it coach Marty Schottenheimer, who has con
sistently choked in big 
games (see Denver vs. 
Cleveland in the AFC 
Championship Game sev
eral years ago)? Was it 
Steve Bono, who had a mis
erable game, throwing mul
tiple interceptions? No, both 
of those guys have safe, secure 
jobs. The guy who paid the price 
was Lin Elliot, who missed three 
makeable field goals that would 
have ensured that the road to 
the Super Bowl would have gone 
through Kansas City, not Pitts
burgh, last year. Of course, Elliot 
was soon out of a job.
You would think that because a 
kicker is so important in close 
games, teams would be lining 
up for consistent kickers. That 
is not the case. Call this the 
Jimmy Johnson/49ers Syn
drome. Johnson and the 49ers 
both believe that with the insti
tution of a salary cap a teams
money is 
players,
better spent on position in a game, than on a kicker that 
who impact more plays sees extremely limited perfor
mance. The rationale here is 
that if you build a good enough 
team, you really dont need a 
great kicker to win games. 
So, the end result has been 
that the 49ers have given 
such stellar booters as 
Doug Brien and, cur
rently, Jeff Wilkins, 
while Johnson now has 
Joe Nedney.
Will these teams re
gret their decisions not 
to have a veteran consis
tent kicker? Nedney 
missed an extra point 
and a field goal in the 
Dolphins narrow win 
over New York. Mean
while, the 49ers had the 
humiliation of losing to 
the .Colts last year  be
fore people realized the 
Colts were goodbecause 
Brien also missed an extra 
point and a couple of field 
goals. So, will teams ever 
realize the importance of a 
kicker? It looks like it takes 
a disaster for teams to real
ize this.
Kansas City decided to 
pick up Pete Stoyanovich 
when Johnson unloaded him 
this training camp; while the 
Bills now have Steve Christie 
Eric Barts/Tartan Junior Staff who has become one of the
more accurate kickers in the game 
today.
And some teams are very lucky. 
The Steelers refused to sign the 
extremely popular and accurate 
Gary Anderson last year when he 
demanded what the team felt was 
too much money. In training 
camp, the contest was between 
Dean Biasucci and Cole Ford, 
neither of whom looked especially 
remarkable.
Well, luckily for the Steelers, 
they were able to pick up vet
eran Norm Johnson off the 
waiver wire, and he went on to 
break the Steelers single-sea
son scoring record, while also 
winning several games for his 
team on last second kicks. But 
you can be assured that they 
have more confidence in him 
than most of the Dolphins do in 
Nedney, who made only 56 per
cent of his attempts in college.
The team that was one of the 
biggest benefactors of missed 
kicks last year has been one of 
this years pleasant surprises: 
the Indianapolis Colts. The 
Colts won the aforementioned 
games with the 49ers and the 
Chiefs because of their oppo
nents failure to convert on cru
cial scoring opportunities that 
relied directly on the foot of a 
kicker.
Already this year, they have 
upset the Dallas Cowboys because
of Chris Boniols inability to kick ! 
two late field goals. The Colts, on  
the other hand, have the very 
sure-footed Cary Blanchard to 
rely on in pressure situations.
Finally, the biggest surprise 
among kickers this year has to be 
Carolinas John Kasay. In the 
first two games, both of which  
not coincidentallythe Panthers 
won, Kasay was 10 for 10 in field 
goal tries, including multiple 
kicks over 50 yards.
Games of the Week:
If there is a week this season 
that you vow not to watch a foot
ball game on Sunday, this may be 
the week to take that break. '1 i3
Carolina at Jacksonville: The
two newest clubs in the NFL meejj. 
Kansas City atSanDiego: Abattje 
between Derrick Thomas and Jun
ior Seau to see if John Carney or Pete 
Stoyanovich gets the chance to win 
the game at the end.
Dallas at Philadelphia: 
Ennnitt gets subjected to the hor
rendous turf at the Vet. Th'e 
Eagles get a chance to show the 
Cowboys that the NFC East won^t 
be a cakewalk this year. ; n
Ronak Singhal is a senior EC& 
major who thinks that Eric 
Cantona might be the best foot? 
ball player in the world.

Columnist does not like QBs
The Pigskin Pundit
by Chris Cannon
In junior high, the quarter
back was the guy who sat next to 
the cheerleader on the bus. In 
high school, he was the guy who 
got next to the cheerleader in 
the back seat. In college, I dont 
know exactly where the quar
terback sits, or who he sits with, 
but he doesnt sit well with me.
I dont like tall quarterbacks, 
I dont like short quarterbacks, 
I dont like strongor weak
armed quarterbacks. I do not 
like them run or pass, I do not 
like them slow or fast. I do not 
like them lose or win, I do not 
like them fat or thin. I dont 
like them running the option 
or the run and shoot and espe
cially not the wing T.
Why, why dont I like them? In 
no other sport is there a position 
where one player gets the chance 
to ruin the whole game every 
play. This position, this player, 
this quarterback usually doesnt 
win the game, but he sure can 
lose it. Whether its the fumbled 
snap, fumbled hand-off, inter
cepted pass, the countless time 
outs or delays of game he causes, 
or the gutless thrower who looks 
for a soft spot to land (instead of 
standing, throwing, and taking 
it like a man), the quarterback 
has too many opportunities to 
make trouble for the team.
Any player anywhere will tell 
you there is no I in team, but 
the quarterback quickly points 
out there is an M and an E.
The quarterback is a selfish, self
ish player. To satisfy his ego, 
statisticians invent needless 
stats in his favor. There is the 
quarterback rating system. 
Theres no running back or free 
safety rating systems; there 
arent even any official stats for 
offensive linemen. In college, this 
rating can easily approach 150. 
What exactly does this mean? 
We count on Mr. Quarterback 
for 150 of what?
Then theres the total yards 
per game stat. The top of this list
does not count against his rush
ing yards.
Especially in college, there is 
no double standard greater than 
that of the role of a quarterback 
within the team. In practice, the 
quarterback gets to wear the spe
cial jersey.
Upon donning this sacred gar
ment, the quarterback becomes 
sacred and untouchable himself. 
Defensive players are not per
mitted to tackle anyone wearing 
the holy jersey. He is the only 
player not expected to block, but
is always stuffed with quarter
backs, because of their bloated 
passing numbers. For another 
position to keep pace, he usually 
must be a good running back, 
catch passes out of the back field, 
and return kicks.
Except for in college, when a 
quarterback gets sacked, the loss
Eric Borts/Tartan Junior Staff
when he does, it consists of un
dercutting the defender by throw
ing his body at the mans feet.
The worst thing of all is the 
arrogant and fanciful manner in 
which they act.
The quarterback exhibits 
strange mannerisms that are 
usually taught by former quar
terbacks, who do not know why 
they did them either. You may 
have observed, at the start of 
every play, the quarterback 
shouts many numbers, colors, 
and commands. Anyone who has 
ever played football knows these 
verbal commands are meaning
less. Upon receiving the oblong 
spheroid, the quarterback typi
cally follows a choreographed 
pattern of steps, often giving 
fakes and even pumping the ball 
in a barbaric ritual.
Players that are unable to mas
ter these steps simply are not al
lowed to become quarterbacks. 
Often I have wondered why there 
are no steps for the nose tackle or 
tight end. Dont they have football 
gods to pray to as well?
Finally, there is the throwing 
motion, which is said to deter
mine the quality of the passer. 
Good quarterbacks, supposedly, 
have the proper throwing me
chanics, while quarterbacks of 
lesser quality do not.
Proper throwing mechanics in
clude making certain your feet 
are happy, keeping your back 
to the largest, bone-crushing op
ponent, and maintaining contact 
between the ball and your chin.
Quarterbacks who cant mas
ter these crafts have a seat on the 
bench, next to the cheerleaders, 
which is where I guess the quar
terback wants to be anyway.

he GC defense out of their sneak
ers with a double hand-off ma
neuver. Soltysik handed off to 
[N;eel who gave the ball to de Jesus 
who made it 14 yards before he 
was brought down, giving the 
team a first down on the threelard line. Freshman defensive 
iack Chris Martinez carried the 
jail for a couple yards to put the 
all on the one-yard line, and 
joltysik finalized the nine play, 
f2-yard drive by running the ball 
icross the line. Another success
ful OMalley extra point put CMU 
jwell ahead of the GC team, 17-3. 
I Grove City started to look alive 
[in their next possession, passing 
for 35 yards in their first two 
ilays, to' put them on the CMU 
15-yard line. The Wolverines died 
(uickly however, throwing sev
eral incomplete passes, until jun
ior nose guard Chad Heald hit 
the Wolverines quarterback with 
ja monster sack on fourth down, 
reversing possession to CMU.
On this final drive of the first 
half. Soltysik threw for 12 and 
ran for nine yards while CMU 
; completed their first down for the 
Tartan squad. After-almost los
ing the ball on a fumble, recovCity 12-yard line on a first down. 
DeJesus ran the ball for another 
nine yards to put the offense on 
the three-yard line, and Campie 
lit up the scoreboard again by 
running it across the line. 
OMalleys extra point attempt 
'went wide to the left, making the 
score 23-3.
Grove City took the kickoff, but 
the Tartan defense held the Wol
verines where they were and 
forced another punt. GC downed 
the 38-yard punt, but a roughingthe-kicker penalty was called on 
CMU to give GC the ball on their 
own 30-yard line. The GC offense 
again took to the air, steadily 
working their way downfield. 
They went from end to end, until 
a GC runner carried the ball into 
the end zone. The successful ex
tra point attempt narrowed 
CMUs lead to 13 points.
The next Tartan offensive 
ended in a punt as the surprised 
Tartans were held by a rejuve
nated Grove City defense. 
Carnegie Mellon banged right 
back with senior defensive back 
Nate Morgan plucking a Grove 
City pass from the air and run
ning it 30 yards into the endzone. 
Jubilation reigned, but even as
ered by junior offensive guard the crowd roared, the officials 
Ray Hiltz, the half ended quickly 
with the score standing at 17-3,
' fcarnegie Mellon.
1 | After halftime, the Tartans beLgan a long scoring drive. Starting 
from their own 19-yard line, the 
am began a streakof successful 
passes and runs by deJesus, 
jGampie, Neel and Soltysik that 
jbrought the squad to the Grove
ruled that the touchdown was no 
good, due to an illegal block 
thrown by a CMU player in the 
backfield.
Regardless of the ruling, the 
Tartans retained possession of 
the ball on the Grove City 18- 
yard line. A series of runs only 
brought the squad to the Wolver
ine 12 on fourth down, where
OMalley was brought 
in to attempt the field 
goal. The kick was wide 
left again, and the drive 
ended without points 
on the board.
After a call against 
CMU prevented them 
from capitalizing on a 
Grove City punt, the 
Wolverine offense 
drove to score another 
six points. The extra 
point attempt was un
successful, leaving the 
Tartans ahead by a 
slim margin, 23-16, 
with only six minutes 
left in the game.
But the crowd was 
undaunted, and to
gether with the Kiltie 
Band they inspired the 
Tartan squad towards the open
ing goal of a win.. Their spirits 
sank as Grove City intercepted 
the ball on a pass from Soltysik, 
after the third down, and ran it 
back 44 yards for a touchdown. 
Combined with the extra point, 
Grove City had tied what seemed 
like an easy win, at 23 points 
apiece with just under four min
utes remaining in the game.
In what would be the final and 
most crucial drive of the game, 
CMU only needed a field goal to 
break the tie. A nine-yard run by 
Soltysik, an eight-yard run by 
Campie, a spectacular 17-yard 
reception by senior tight end T. J. 
Sharpe, and a nine-yard recep
tion by Neel spurred the Tartans 
downfield to a fourth and two 
situation on the Wolverine 17 
with only seconds left on the clock. 
The decision was an easy one, as 
OMalley went for the 35-yard, 
three-point attempt. The crowd 
exploded in towel-waving ecstasy 
as the kick was waved good by 
officials. The 2623 win couldnt 
have been more fitting of a home 
opener in classic Tartan fashion.
Head coach Rich Lackner 
said that OMalleys field goal 
was a real gutsy move  he did 
a great job." Lackner also said 
that the snap for that final field 
goal was not very good and that 
ball holder Trigianni did good 
getting that ball down. He said, 
Hopefully, this win turns us 
around in terms Of our whole 
frame of mind.
The Tartans next host Rhodes 
College this Saturday at Gesling 
Stadium at 1:30 pm.

Smart trades bolster | Penguins Cup dreams
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
Last year, I predicted that 
the Pittsburgh Penguins would 
win the Stanley Cup  I was 
obviously wrong.
I wo,nt be hasty and repeat 
that prediction, but I will say 
that the Penguins will probthey did last year in the play
offs.
The Pens made some smart 
moves during the off-season, at 
Lemieuxs request. He may be 
the greatest player in the game 
today, but it was still poor sports
manship to say after the NHL 
Awards ceremony that he was 
only coming back if there were 
trades made to appease him. 
Also, dont forget the ESPN in
terview where Lemieux said the 
Florida Panthers didnt deserve 
to be in the finals. Id like 
Lemieux a lot better if he re
fused to talk to the media, like 
Tom Barrasso has for the past
ably be one of the final four 
teams again. Give me a week 
of play before I make a Cup 
prediction.
The answer to the question 
every hockey fan is asking is, 
Yes, Lemieux will be back. 
Mario announced that this may 
be his last season, which Im 
sure will spark the team and 
make them play harder than
Eric Borts/Junior Staff
few years.
Trading defensive liability 
Sergei Zubov to the Dallas 
Stars for hard-hitting Kevin 
Hatcher was the Penguins big
gest move of the summer. Ive 
always been a fan of the eldest 
Hatcher, so Im excited about 
seeing him in black and gold. 
The Pens may have given up 
speed and stickhandling in the
deal, but Hatcher is a bettef 
defenseman all around. Hopei 
fully hell continue the aggres
sive play that helped Team USA 
capture the World Cup.
General Manager Craig Patrick 
made some smart moves in th 
free agent market, but he maae 
some dumb ones as well. He let 
Kevin Miller and Dave Mcllwaiii 
go, but signed Kevin Todd, TylefWright, and Joe Mullen. None of 
these players are superstars, but 
theyre the type of role player^ 
every team needs to win thp 
Stanley Cup.
Mullen especially will contrib
ute a lot to the team, maybe not in 
goals, but definitely in leader
ship. Patrick also signed Dan 
Quinn and Shawn Antoski jtwo moves obviously made foi^ 
Lemieux. Antoski will b4 
Lemieuxs bodyguard and will 
be gone by the seasons end, like 
Marty McSorely before him. 1 
hope they signed Quinn because 
he is a good friend of Lemieuxsj, 
not because of his skill. Hisprim 
was eight years ago, the first 
time he was a Penguin.
Three key players from last 
years squad remain unsigned; 
Chris Tamer, PetrNedved, and 
Bryan Smolinski. I wouldnt 
have included Smolinski in the 
list had I not seen his play in 
the World Cup.
If the Penguins resign thes0 
three and pick up another qualf 
ity defenseman  possibly 
Boris Mironov, whos currently 
a free agent  they will hav a 
good chance to bring Lemieux tlf  
Cup before he retires.Lj
Jason Andracki is a senior, 
professional writing major. Hq 
would like to congratulate 
Team USA on winning the in
augural World Cup of Hockey\ 
Only 12 days left until tfie.

Trying to avoid their worst start since 
1972, the 0-2 Carnegie Mellon Tartans 
took the field against one of their oldest 
rivals, the Grove City Wolverines, this 
weekend. The Spirit of Skibo truly ef
fected everyone, as the stands at 
Saturdays home opener filled with 2,431 
fans waving their Plaid Power towels. 
With the Kiltie Band in superior form 
and the stadium lined with encouraging 
banners, the Tartans held back a late 
surging Grove City squad, to win the 
game 26-23. I thought the crowd was 
fantastic, said head coach Rich Lackner. 
Maybe since [Gesling] Stadium opened 
in. 1990, Ive never seen a better crowd.
Lackner was somewhat less enthusi

We whupped em, Coach Gary Meckley said of 
the mens cross country victory last Saturday at 
the Indiana Invitational.
In cross country, the top five finishers places 
score towards the teams total, with the lowest sum 
winning the meet. Over the 5.1-mile course, CMUs 
scorers were led by sophomore Kristo Kriechbaum, 
the third finisher overall at 27:36, followed by 
freshman Kenn Oldham (27:40, 5th), senior Seb 
Zeisler (27:50,6th), sophomore JoshDonner (27:55, 
8th), and senior Ron Polcawich (28:04, 12th).
What was impressive, Meekly said enthusias
tically, was that we had our five guys within 28 
seconds [of each other].
Teams like to have their top five finishers come 
in within a minute of each other, the coach ex
plained. We had 10 guys do that. After the top 
five, freshman Brian Meyer, senior Scott Moore,
freshman Jim Gorham, senior Greg Stoltz, and 
freshman Eric Egenolf were all within 1:06 of] 
Kriechbaums time.
Although virtually the same group has scored in; 
the past two meets, Meckley said he expects some; 
upperclassmen and freshmen to move into the top! 
five and make us even stronger.
Next week, the team will take some lower,v 
classmen and members who havent had a chance 
to run yet this season to the Hiram meet before, 
a showdown with Grove City.
Grove City thinks theyre gonna whup us, but; 
theyre not, Meckley said.
Down the road, the Tartans can look forward! 
to even tougher competition. UAA opponents 
Rochester, Brandeis, and Washington Univer-I 
sity are all nationally ranked, and we arent 
yet, Meckley said.

Soltysik began the scoring drive in ear
nest. After four plays, senior wide re
ceiver Casey Smith caught a 16-yard 
pass from Soltysik to give the Tartans 
some important yardage. On the next 
play, freshman halfback, Ellis deJesus 
blasted through the GC line for another 
eight yards, giving the team another 
first down, this one on their opponents 
20-yard line. Soltysik handed the ball off 
to Campie, who danced through the GC 
line to the endzone to put the Tartans 
ahead 6-3, ending a 59-yard drive which 
covered seven plays. Freshman kicker 
Pat OMalley put away the extra point.

game.
Grove City received the initial 
kickoff, but the punt return was 
th e most yardage they would claim 
on their first possession. The Tar
tan defenders kept the Wolver
ines to a single yard in three downs, 
forcing the GC team to punt.
Sophomore defensive back Ja
son Funke took the punt and reThe .uwduMS 
turned it 14 yards. On the next 
play, GC defensemen tore through the 
Tartans defensive line, stripping the 
ball from the surprised fullback and 
running the fumble to CMUs own 32- 
yard line. This first-and-10 situation 
started a Wolverine scoring drive that 
spanned five plays. With the ball on the 
eight-yard line on fourth down, GC 
placekicker Rich Anderson easily put it 
through the uprights for the first points 
of the game. Grove City led 3-0.
Undaunted, the Tartans started their 
drive to score on a Buck Neel punt re
turn for 26 yards. After a few messy 
scrambles, senior quarterback Dave

The next Grove City drive was over in 
the first play as junior outside linebacker 
Josh Stauffer and senior defensive tackle 
Todd McManus sacked GC quarterback, 
Jeff Porter, for a 10-yard loss. After 
another two disappointing plays, the 
Wolverines decided to punt.
The Tartans would start the next se
ries on the Grove City 30-yard line. 
Campie, deJesus, and Neel all completed 
plays for short yardage. On fourth and 
two, OMalley made a 40-yard field goal 
to bolster the Tartan lead to 10-3 at the 
end of the first quarter.
The second quarter started off very
slowly, as the teams took turns 
force their way through the 
defenders. Late in the quarter, 
began a strong drive after senior 
sive back Albie Fletcher ran a 
punt back 12 yards. The Tartans contin
ued their strong rushing game, with 
Neel, Soltysik, Campie, and. deJesus 
carrying the ball for 66 yards and two 
first downs  highlighted by Campies 
32-yard sideline run. This put the team

This week the mens soccer 
team played two tough games, 
fcoming out with a win and a tie. 
The win was earned Wednesday 
against a tough Allegheny team 
'that only yielded one goal, and 
the tie came against conference 
opponent University of Chicago.
Wednesdays game against Al
legheny was a hard-fought 
match that moved back and 
forth throughout the game. The 
teams were originally scheduled 
to meet at Allegheny, but the 
game was moved to CMUs 
Gesling Stadium because of bad 
weather. It was a fast-paced 
game from the start, with each 
team trying to crack the others 
.defense and score. Ball movement and communication be
came the key factors in decid
ing who controlled play. Con
trol of the ball changed sides a 
number of times, and neither 
team was able to establish clear 
dominance. Most of the first 
half continued this way with
out any great scoring opportu
nities for either side.
As time dwindled in the first 
half, CMU made a push towards 
the Allegheny goal and earned a 
corner kick from the right side of 
the field. The kicker placed the 
ball eight yards in front of the 
net where freshman defender 
Dave Huryk leapt above the sur
rounding defenders and headed 
the ball into the lower right cor
ner of the net.
The 1-0 lead held until half 
time, where both teams re5uwwk luM9pwj.uwduM fzMgow nduaa

grouped. Allegheny came out 
hungry and put the Tartans on 
the defensive at first. However, 
the game quickly reached an 
equilibrium much like that of 
the first half as the teams 
fought for control of the 
midfield. After 15 minutes, the 
inexperience of the Tartans 
became apparent as Allegheny 
was able to push the ball in the 
Carnegie Mellon penalty box. 
Strong play from freshman 
goalie Ben Katzman, and 
Alleghenys inability to do any
thing inside of the box pre
vented a goal.
Katzman gave another strong 
performance. Using his height, 
he was able to break up all of 
Alleghenys corner kicks. Ben 
gives us a lot of confidence in 
goal, said senior team captain 
Suraj Naik.
On Saturday, the team 
traveled to Chicago to play 
UAA opponent University of 
Chicago. The first half didnt 
produce any goals, yet early 
in the second half, junior Ja
son Buelow scored to give 
CMU a 1-0 lead. For most of 
the rest of the second half, 
CMU controlled the game. At 
times they functioned so well 
as a unit that they seemed to 
walk through the Chicago defense. However, mental 
lapses toward the end of the 
game proved costly. Unlike 
the Allegheny game, the 
team was not able to stop the 
Chicago attack, and CMU 
gave up a goal with only a 
small amount of time remain
ing in regulation to end in a 
1-1 tie.
The team remained upbeat 
about the remainder of the sea
son, despite not winning the 
game. The team showed 
sparks of life. Its only a mat
ter of time before we put it all 
together said freshman de
fender Brad Malin.
The next game for the mens 
soccer team is October 1 at 
Grove City. The team will not 
play at home again until Octo
ber 9, when it faces Waynesburg.

University of Chicago, for an over
all record of 3-11 and a UAA 
record of 0-11.
With the season off to a strong I think we have some things 
start, the CMU womens soccer we want to accomplish and were 
team last week added a win on the right track, said head 
against Grove City and a loss to  coach Ann Haggerty. The team
is strong enough to sustain 
the pace it has set.
Last Tuesdays home 
game against Grove City 
proved to be an exciting one 
for the Tartans. Grove City 
scored in the first half, leav
ing the game 1-0. As the 
game entered the second 
half, and the Tartans re
sponded with a goal-by jun
ior forward Kim Umeda. The 
two teams were still tied at 
the end of the game, forcing 
CMU to face its old nemesis
 overtime play.
Last season, the team lost 
every game that it played 
into overtime. In the over
time game against Case 
Western Reserve two weeks 
ago, the team ended up tied 
0-0. But at the Grove City 
game, the team was finally 
able to use its strong offen^ x , sive drive and score threeszSduYo n9uMzpwiuj.uwduM 3vodo9wuIvpw T, . , , , _ _ ^ . more goals, resulting in afzMgow aoGuwe luzwpM /pEoSSpd ewgYpS r 1 e . 1_ ,  final score or 4-1. Ihe over-dvp Wuii eoGMagpieT 1  1 1  c 1time goals by jumor forward
Lauren deRosset, senior 
midfielder Jill Sincaglia, and se
nior midfielder Mae Hogan tipped 
the scales for the Tartans.
These were the first goals weve 
had in overtime, said Haggerty, 
The most challenging thing 
about the game was winning in 
overtime, said deRosset. It was 
one of our first games in a long 
time when we won in overtime - 
I guess it was the mental block 
that we had to overcome.
On Saturday, the team lost 0- 
1 to the University of Chicago, 
Although Haggerty set a team 
goal of trying to slow the pace of 
Chicagos game and stop their 
counterattack, the Tartans, 
werent able to pull through and 
score.
As a highlight to the teams 
performance, sophomore goal
keeper Lindsay Smith was named, 
the University Athletic 
Associations Soccer Player of the 
Week after three games with 16. 
saves and without a single score 
on her goal.
It was just a shock; I wasnt 
really expecting it, said Smitlu 
The whole team played so well.".
The team is away against: 
Marietta on Wednesday and 
home against St. Marys on Sat,

dually take proactive steps to make changes. How many students 
an say theyve spoken to a representative or voiced their opinions in 
public forum? How many students know more than just the names 
if the Presidential candidates and what party they represent?
While most of us will go as far as filling out a ballot, Jillian 
Catkins will be able to cast a vote on a ticket she actively worked 
osupport. A sophomore, history major, Watkins volunteered, this 
ummer, as a contact for outreach groups at the Clinton/Gore 
lain headquarters in Washington D.C. Her responsibilities 
isually included phone banking for various groups, depending 
n whoever needed help at that time.
On my first day, I picked up a package from the Secret 
ervice office because the Clinton/Gore mailroo 
bought might be harmful, said Watkins. It didn 
iave a return address.

public policy major
Watkins often typed press releases of Presidential and Vice-Presi
dential speeches to be mailed out and communicated between offices 
vithin the headquarters. Each day the assignment was different, 
jut I got exposure to the workings of a campaign, she said. 
Watkins said many students took a semester off from school in 
order to keep working with the campaign through the election; she 
found it difficult herself to leave the atmosphere before seeing it to the 
end. It was rewarding to work on a campaign because everyone is 
[connected and working towards a common goal: to make sure that the 
Candidate gets.into office, she said.
Since the last election, Clinton's popularity with younger genera
tions has plummeted, due in part to his new image as the baby boomer 
[president and a move towards more conservative legislation. Watkins 
jpointed out that Clintons support of education and in particular, the 
passing, of the Student Loan Reform Act were indicative of his 
iterest in student issues.
Its important to look at what hes done, said Paul McKrell, the 
youth coordinator for the Clinton/Gore headquarters in Pittsburgh 
;and the regional' coordinator of College Democrats. He is a political 
icience major at the University of Pittsburgh. Hes made it easier for 
jtudents to find loans and grants. Hes passed the minimum wage bill, 
'hich directly affects college students who tend to support themilv.es with minimum wage jobs. McKrell said Dole voted against 
oth bills.
| McKrell is currently trying to form a CMU chapter of College 
'emocrats, with the help of students like Watkins and other students 
orking at the Clinton/Gore headquarters. He said that 200 students 
ire on record as part of the local campaign, most of whom attend the 
Jniversity of Pittsburgh.

Students promote 
voter registration
By RHONDA GILLESPIE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In order to vote in the upcoming 
election voters must register by No
vember 5.
Last Wednesday through Friday, AL
LIES, the Womens Center and Am
nesty International made sure that 
CMU students had an oppor
tunity to make that deadline.
They held a voter registration 
drive in front of Doherty Hall; 
the table, manned from 10 am 
to 4 pm that provided registra
tion forms and pens for stu
dents wanting to sign up.
Members of these groups 
outlined to students some of 
the differences in voting in 
Pennsylvania as opposed to 
voting in their home state.
Voting in Pennsylvania could 
be better than voting absentee 
because absentee ballots are not 
counted for the Presidential election 
unless the election is really close, 
said Esther Park, a sophomore electri
cal and computer engineering and so
cial and decision sciences major. But 
at the same time, you need to think 
about your politics back home.
Young potential voters have recently 
come under fire by many political
groups, alleging that college students 
are apathetic and uninvolved in poli
tics. The groups organizing the voter 
registration drive hoped to remedy 
that. We feel that getting [college 
students] registered is half the battle. 
We want to try to encourage them to 
vote, said Park. Right now, shesaid, 
young voters are outnumbered by seBy registering and voting

Awareness programs attack issues
5k h$C. bhE
Tartan Business Manager
College years are supposed to 
be a time of learning and explo
ration. Youre supposed to try 
new things, evaluate your mis
takes and successes, and make 
decisions based on your experi
ences. This period of growth is 
not limited to just academic or 
career development  college 
students experiment with new 
friends, new attitudes, new sub
stances, new sexuality.
In an effort to better educate 
the campus about these issues, 
the Office of the President, the 
Office of Student Life, and the 
:Interfraternity Council are 
sponsoring the Student Aware
ness Program, a series of pre
sentations aimed at education 
about substances, diversity, 
and ethical decision making.
The Student Awareness 
Program started out of a desire 
on the part of the IFC to pro
vide new members with educa
tion about [the critical issues 
t of] diversity, health and 
wellness, and ethics and re| sponsible decision making, 
said John Hannon, assistant di
rector of Student Life. The pro
gram was deemed to be so effec
tive, it was decided to open it 
up to the whole campus community, Hannon said.
The program, which was de
veloped during the summer by 
IFC President and Delta Upsi
lon brother Brendan Clarke, op
erates under the auspices of 
the Office of Student Life, where
Simona Lo/Tartan Art Co-editor 
-Clarke interned during the 
summer. Clarkes motivation 
behind designing the program 
was to ensure that all members 
had an equal opportunity to 
learn about issues.affecting col
lege students.
I guess I benefited from some
of the stuff Ive heard over the 
years and I wanted students to 
have a way to find answers to 
questions they may have, he 
said. But Clarke soon recog
nized the programs wider ap
plicability.
I felt it would be a 
little too opportunistic 
not to extend it to all 
the members of the 
campus, he said.
Pledges and new 
members of the frater
nity community are re
quired to attend at least 
five of the 12 scheduled 
presentations this se
mester. In addition, the 
IFC requires its mem
bers to attend at least 
one presentation con
cerning drugs and al
cohol and at least one 
on ethical decision 
making. The rest of the 
campus community are 
free to choose.
The programs devel
opers have ensured 
that its sights are locked firmly 
on dissemination of informa
tion and not dictation. The aim 
is not to preach, Clarke said. 
But maybe in five minutes in 
each lecture we can hit some
one somehow.
This has been accomplished
partly by taking more of a pre
sentation approach than a lec
ture approach.
Some speakers will use mu
sic or visuals to get the audi
ence involved. We try to get 
dynamic speakers to keep the 
audience captivated, Clarke 
said.
Another aspect that has 
helped to broaden the appeal of 
the program is the inclusion of 
both university and outside ex
perts.
We have taken advantage of 
a lot of great speakers on cam
pus, but well do our best to get 
off-campus professionals in
volved, said Clarke.
University speakers include 
Michael Murphy, dean of Stu
dent Affairs who will be speak
ing on ethical decision making, 
and Everett Tademy, director 
of CMUs Office on Equal Op
portunity and Affirmative Ac
tion, who spoke on diversity.
The Office of Student Life is 
confident that the program will 
prove beneficial to all those who 
attend, and extend an invita
tion to all interested members 
of the campus community.

one to attend  I think its a 
great opportunity. For more

In your expeditions through the new University Center, you may 
have noticed a room located on the first floor, right next to the 
Student Activities Office and directly across from the Alumni Hall. 
This room holds an exhibit of photographs, text, and video centering 
around the theme of CMUs history and development.
The University Exhibition Space celebrates CMU traditions and 
experiences through a display of the artistic talents of students, 
faculty, staff, and the immediate surrounding community. It serves 
to expose the CMU community to matters of cultural, intellectual, 
and other interests.
While the space is currently being used as an art gallery, other 
plans for the space are in the making. Both Heather Midkiff and 
Anne Witchner of the Student Activities Office are responsible for 
the development of this experimental project. Until December, we 
are in atrial period.... There is a lot of opportunity in what can be 
done with the room, said Midkiff.
Artwork submitted by the CMU community will be showcased 
for the first two weeks of October and during November,. Midkiff 
said that the room will hold an exhibit during the International 
Festival, during which visitors will be able to write on papercovered walls. .
Some other proposed themes are Spring Carnival, the Student 
Undergraduate Research Grants (SURG), and a Design Depart
ment showcase of student work.
Currently, the gallery is soliciting proposals for the student 
artwork that will be displayed in October and November. Ads have 
been posted on bulletin boards and around campus. News of the 
gallery has primarily been word of mouth, said Midkiff. The 
deadline for October, proposals is this Wednesday.
There is a very loose committee which will decide on what exhibits 
are displayed. The committee has not even met yet ... If this 
[gallery] does work out, the process will be more formalized, said 
MidMff.
Were hoping that this will evolve into something where stu
dents will be proactive in submitting proposals [for exhibits and 
events],she said.
Currently, two students take shifts staffing the gallery and 
providing information to visitors. In October, theyll transfer some 
of the student art from the other art gallery to here, said Tolga 
Ehran, a masters student in industrial administration who works 
at the gallery. He also said the galleiy would provide passersby who 
would not normally visit an art gallery a convenient opportunity to 
see some of community talent on display.
Overall, this is definitely an excellent chance to showcase some 
of the talent in the community, said Midkiff. Although only about 
five visitors sign the sign-in book every day, Midkiff estimates that 
between 20 and 30 people enter the gallery and look around.
For more information or to submit a proposal for a display, contact 
Midkiff by email (midkifj@andrew.cmu.edu), phone (268-1281), or 
visit the Student Activities Office in the University Center.

Romance novels sexualize, warp image of women
CRACKING THE MYTH
by Elizabeth Irvine
Romance novels are fascinating to 
;;nie. Both sexist and empowering, 
tacky and melodramatic, they man
age to satisfy their readers enough 
to keep them reading. They are not 
literary masterpieces in any way; in 
fact, if you go to Barnes and Nobles 
up on Murray, they will tell you flat 
out they dont carry that kind of 
fiction. They are embarrassing to 
read in public, humiliating to pur
chase, but undeniably important. 
The fact that over 100 million women 
read them every year and that ro
mance is the largest publishing in
dustry in the United States gives 
them some kind of credibility. _Why 
do women read these? Dismissed 
daily and laughed at in literary 
circles, the fact that so many women 
read them says something impor
tant about our culture and the fe
male experience within it. Ignoring 
the role romance plays in the every
day existence of women, minimizes 
all women.
First, to clarify, the kinds of ro
mance I am discussing are the ones 
with Fabio on the cover and titles 
like Lucky Chance, the pun being 
that Chance is the name of the hunky 
love interest. These novels, unlike 
classics like Emma or Wuthering 
Heights, do not, in fact, withstand 
the test of time. The story is cliched, 
the characters one-dimensional, the 
language frivolous and the overall 
simplicity makes them easily forget
table. Harlequin, the largest ro
mance publisher, has a form the writ
ers have to follow. The names, occu
pations, appearances, and setting 
are changeable, but the main ele
ments must follow a strict pattern. 
Girl meets man, they fight or are 
suspicious of one another, they dis
cover their love, they have great sex, 
and they start a family. In the ro
mance industry, unhappy endings 
do not exist.
If we start to examine the romance 
novel more closely, it becomes obvi
ous that the heroines have similar 
traits: they are all white, young (the 
emphasis on girl and man), and dis
satisfied with their lives; they are 
ordinarv women who lead ordinary 
lives. But, interestingly enough, 
these ordinary women are always 
beautiful. In fact, the emphasis on 
appearance in romance novels is one

the description in the average 188- 
page Harlequin. Men are described 
even more specifically. The men are 
always physically larger, tall, and 
strong. Often, the writer will com
pare the difference in the heroine 
and the heros bodies, making a dis
tinct contrast between her fragility 
and smallness and his strength and 
hugeness. The men are typically 
smarter, better educated, more sexuare hard and gripping. In Man
hattan Heat, He shoved her against 
him, even closer than she was al
ready, and maybe harder than he 
had meant to. She cried out amidst 
her moans, but he knew it wasnt 
from pain, because she didnt want 
him to stop. He knew that by the way 
she pulled his thigh tighter to her 
and tortured her body against it. 
This is a pretty typical love scene.

up Harlequins excellently, When 
women try to picture excitement, the 
society offers them one vision: ro

if she has more money or is better

problem within the novel.
Sex in romance novels depends on 
the type of Harlequin you have pur
chased. They span from pornographic 
(Dangerous Men series), to really 
vague making out (American Clas

It is amazing that Harlequins are

Gabriel Brooks, sophomore H&SS unde

they dont have to register in their home state, 
and that they can register here. This campus 
is so non-political that you at least have to get 
people to vote and become part of the political 
world.
The voter registration drive was geared to
ward freshmen, but was open to all CMU 
students and faculty. Everyone was encour
aged to register in the state of Pennsylvania
as opposed to registering in their home state. 
Womens Center representatives felt that 
students at CMU are affected by the legisla
tion passed locally, and thereby need to take 
part in the voting process here.

We got a pretty 
good turn out.

surprising. A

Anyone still 
interested in 
registering to 
vote in Pennsylvania
should contact the Allegheny County Voter 
Registration Offices or the University Cen

If you dont know if youre going to end up 
voting in the November elections, it doesnt 
cost you anything to register. Dont pass up 
the opportunity to do so now, Kingman said. 
The deadline to register isOctober 5.

Carrillo, a freshmen public 
policy major works with both 
Watkins and McKrell at the 
Clinton/Gore campaign head
quarters.
We basically run a grassroots 
campaign effort, she said.
Carrillo fears another weak

[this year, due to the lack of 
participation of CMU students

In 1992, only 20% of student
voters used their ballot, which 
Carrillo find disturbing.
Students should understand 
that Doles tax cuts on educa
tion will effect Stafford loans 
and Pell grants, she said.It 
will affect how students pay for 
college.
For Watkins^ her campaign 
efforts have been easy because 
of her strong support of 
Clintons platform. He has 
made a commitment to 
Americas youth, she said.
Watkins appeared in a cam

Knapp and Ochs endorsing
Hillary Clinton.
She answered telephone calls 
from Dole supporters or angry 
opponents to Clinton legislation 
and responded as a campaign

It was exciting to know that 
I affected the cause, she said. 
Watkins is working to hold an
other voter registration drive

irtan Junior Staffwriter
At 6:40 pm on Saturday night the view 
om the University Centers Round 
oom of the last preparations for CMUs 
st home football game 1996, looked 
miewhat disheartening. With a crowd 
[at covered little more than half the 
,ands, and a marching band that was 
ibstantially smaller than Grove Citys, 
chances of defeat, at least in spirit, 
lenied threatening. But that was desned to change. At approximately 6:55 
first onset of stampeding, scream, towel-waving fans came running 
tto the stadium. They were led by an 
ithusiastic member of CMUs newit spirit organization, Spirit of Skibo, 
hich is dedicated to improving stuent spirit and enthusiasm on cam. As the scoreboard quickly reached 
to 3 in favor of CMU, and a loud, 
otous crowd sporting kitchen utenls danced the infamous Baby 
hark, the situation for CMU defitely held promise.
And it continued to improve. There 
ere 2,431 fans at the game (or so the
ead proclaiming, CMU. Spirit'of 
kibos sideline acts, such as chants, 
ances, and a group of five shirtless, 
oeless, members with CMU #1 
tinted on their backs, simply'could not
o wrong. The crowd was boisterous, 
id even the Kiltie Band, which had 
nly 89 members in contrast to Grove 
ttys 195, seemed menacing. This is 
ke the third real crowd Ive ever seen 
ere. said Lee Secratow, a senior 
&SS student, who comeg'to the games 
! the time.
It was that track record, in fact, that
was the incentive for starting an organi
zation dedicated to spirit here at CMU. 
In an interview atthe Fence last Wednes
day night, Eric Borts, club president 
and senior electrical and computer engi
neering major identified the 
organizations objectives. We just want 
to show people that you can have a good 
time here at CMU, he said. Were a 
bunch of people who are excited about 
being here, and we want our enthusi
asm to spread.
This is evident from the makeup of the 
club. Many of the members are former
mMp 2p2Wpw oa nIgwgd oa nAgWo GpMd do uii 
2puSzwpS do SvoG vgS SzIIowdT
orientation counselors from this years 
freshman orientation week, or resident 
assistants. In an effort to capitalize on 
the apparent increase in spirit in this 
years freshman class, Borts made the 
decision to form a new organization 
rather spontaneously and last minute
 he turned in the application form on 
the Tuesday before the Activities Fair. 
Fortunately, this decision, or rather,
sudden revelation during class, paid off. 
The newly-formed Spirit of Skibo (and 
thats Sky-bo not Skee-bo) received over 
150 signatures from interested people 
willing to be loyal sons (or daughters) of 
Skibo for the glory of Carnegie Mellon.
In addition to the attraction of school 
spirit, this may also be in part due to the 
clubs emphasis on minimum obligation 
for members  no fines, no dues, and no 
buggy, said Borts. Our membership 
requirements are any animal, vegetable, 
or mineral wishing to promote school 
spirit, including the fence. said Borts. 
All you need is school spirit and youre 
in.
In affirmation of this, the organiza
tion is not limited to undergraduates. 
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy, for example, as well as other 
faculty members and people involved 
with the Student Life Office are mem
bers of the club. The only rules for 
admission are that members be voted 
into the club, which they can do them
selves, and that each person have an 
office, for example, Minister of Propa
ganda, Official Rain Maker, and Of
ficial Chaser of Thunderstorms. 
Despite these attractions, whether 
membership will grow substantially can 
not be determined at this point, given 
the organizations short history. They 
plan to rely on word of mouth for public
ity, as well as on displays such as these 
that decorated the sidewalk and the fence 
last Thursday to advertise the game. How
ever, if success rather than time is taken 
into account, the organizations past has 
been very prosperous so far. Whether 
CMUs victory can be attributed to team 
strength or school spirit or both, 
Saturdays game was a victory for 
Carnegie Mellon on and off the field.

Party animal rants about rave
By ANDY SEYMOUR
| Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Uh, two words. Deee Groovey? Holdsome Pro! ductions party, That Thing, was rumored to be the 
rival of Pittsburghs big rave event in the summer 
i of95, Tunnelvisioji. That Thing took place at the 
j Washington County Fairgrounds in Washington 
County, Penn., last Saturday from 10 pm to 10 am 
! Sunday morning.
With such superstar DJs in the main room as 
! Dmitry of Deee-Lite, Carlos from CDC Soundsystem 
I in San Francisco, Kimball Collins from X-Mix 
Productions in Florida, Rob Paine of Special K in 
i Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh DJs Dieselboy, 
Smoov, and Ruffian, this was one phat party ... at 
; least in some respects. Other DJs such as Warm; ing, Sharp-A, Smartie, Eric D, Count Zero, Bleep, 
Saint, and Product 19 spun fast acid tracks, breaks,
; and other happy boomin stuff in an adjacent room.
With the cold, rainy weather, party-goers frantid cally crowded the entrance, while irritable bounc! ers ordered them to back off. This set the stage for 
. what was to be yet another fast and characteristi
cally Pittsburgh party on the fairgrounds. Pitts; burgh parties have been known for their interest
ing locations, but each city has its idiosyncracies. 
Other parties, such as Trancedence 1 and 
; Trancedence 2, have been held at the same loca
tion. So raves are nothing new to this area, though 
by morning, a few farmers could be seen wandering 
around with puzzled looks on their faces.
The party began in the main room with the 
haunting jungle beats of Dieselboy and others, 
then took off into funky house sets that injected the 
floor with energy. D J Carloss set was by far the best
by just about everyones standards. Scratching in 
feverish drops of acid into house and just plain hard 
techno, he captured everyones attention. A whole 
troop of dancers stood in awe watching him spin his 
set.
Though Dmitry was a center of attention prior to 
the party, many said that though his sets were 
composed of cool tracks, his style was nothing spe
cial. This was only a rumor, it proved to be quite true, 
judging by everyones response.
Far fewer people could be found in the other room, 
and there was just less energy there, though the 
sounds were hard and fierce. The main room, in 
contrast, was the center of attention. The vibe therein, 
without a doubt, was positive.
After a few hours, the rain let up, but it was still as 
cold as ever. While walking between the two dance 
floors, one watched as the number of security person
nel  which initially consisted of about seven or 
eight cops and a couple of EMS units  dwindled. 
This is nothing new to the scene, considering these 
parties usually last into the wee hours of the morn
ing. Thats when most security personnel either give 
up or head home. However, there were a few arrests 
made that night, for obvious reasons  illicit party 
favors, etc. But that, too, is nothing new to the scene. 
Police have evidently been cracking down much 
harder on parties in the past few months.
Overall, most people left this party with somewhat 
of a smile. Though this party was projected to rival 
other Pittsburgh parties, Tunneluision in particu
lar, the turnout and the overall energy of That Thing 
paled in comparison. Carloss set left everyone 
smiling, but the overall quahty was, at best, average. 
It was not by any means horrible, but upcoming 
parties will easily top this one.

WRCT plays to a new beat
r~
By DAVID ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Lying in the basement of the 
University Center is a monster. 
It belches great gusts of rock and 
rap, reggae and jazz, metal and 
ska. Of all the organizations to 
make the move to the building, 
perhaps the most affected was 
WRCT, the campus radio station. 
The relocation meant that the 
space had to be wired, equipment 
moved, and a lot of effort exerted. 
This was complicated by the 
administrations apparent lack of 
communication with the station. 
According to Steve Schlosser, 
Chief Engineer for WRCT and a 
junior ECE major, it was May 
before the two sides met, and by 
the end of July, WRCT still had 
only a rough idea of what they 
were required to do. This caused 
a time crunch and pushed the 
move back to the point where 
there is still work to be done.
Nevertheless, with the hard 
work of the staff, WRCT is almost 
settled into its new home  one 
that, although similar in size to 
the last, boasts an improved lay
out with features such as angu
lar walls that prevent sound re
flection, bigger production spaces, 
and a glass wall fronting the 
lobby.
The new academic year has also
wrought other changes on the 
station. This years general man
ager is Neil Donnelly, a sopho
more. He is one of the many sopho
mores on the executive staff, 
which also includes Program Di
rector Joe Hughes, Public Rela
tions Director Michele Banko, 
Training Director Conor Platt, 
Production Director Nicole Cook, 
and Promotions Director Joe 
Kenney. Having a young staff 
allows them time to get into their 
roles and grasp them within the 
station as a whole, said Neil 
Donnelly. In the coming three 
years, the staff will get a grip on 
how to run things smoothly, and 
the station will be better off as a 
whole. In addition, Donnelly em
phasized that the staff are enthu
siastic due to their fresh perspec
tives.
As always, WRCT remains 
dedicated to broadcasting a di
verse blend of music, much of 
which listeners (both on and off 
campus) could not hear anywhere 
else. The station maintains a free 
format in which each DJ plays 
what he or she so desires, from 
the softest classical to the harsh
est experimental. This can be seen 
in the schedule which runs from 
the experimental sounds of 
Threshold to the metal of Satan 
Oscillate my Metallic Sonatas. 
Other popular shows returning
are the poundingLzue: FreeBassin \ 
with the Techno Terrorists, the \ 
punk/hardcore of luffXcore and \ 
Geek Radio, the swinging ska of | 
Skank SomeMore\, and the eclecJ 
tic Dancing at Lughnasa. Also | 
not to be missed are the reggae of \ 
Island Spice, the rap RS Fort Knox \ 
II, the country of Fear and Whis\ 
key, the gothic of Fire Dances, the ; 
industrial ofElmer Elf and Cookie \ 
Friend, and the jazz and indie 1 
that are liberally sprinkled 
throughout the schedule.
In addition to broadcasting mu! 
sic, WRCT also sponsors concerts | 
around campus and is planning on | 
releasing a CD soon. A compila! 
tion of local bands, it should be 
available in a few months with a 
roster of artists as diverse as the 
stations playlist, including Swob, 
Shale, Hurl, D J Static, REVO, LPN 
and others.
For more information on 
scheduling or the CD, or just to 
look around the new facilities, 
feel free to drop by the station. 
WRCT is located in the base
ment of the University Center, 
down the hallway from the text
book store, so you cant miss it. 
As an additional place to obtain 
information about whats going 
on with the station, the website 
http://www.wrct.org contains 
up-to-the-minute information 
for stalwart surfers.

What: The Highlander Director's Cut 
Director: Russell Mulcahy 
Company: EMI Films
Highlander laserdisc presents directors new cuts with quality
3y DAN GOLDWASSER
'Tartan Staffwriter
 The supposedly official film of CMU is back in 
{stores. But this time, Highlander is a bit differ
ent. This is the directors cut  as Russell 
Mulcahy intended it to be. With over six more 
farinutes of scenes from the European release, 
this is the definitive version of Highlander.
\ Yes, some fight scenes are now longer. Yes, 
the missing WWII scene is back in place. Yes, 
the Zoo scene is also there. What am I talking 
bout? Well, to recap the story, Connor MacLeod 
(Christopher Lambert) is immortal. He has to 
fight other immortals to gain the prize. The 
only way an immortal can be killed is to have his 
head cut off. MacLeod learns about himself from
Ramirez (Sean Connery), who plays the Yoda / 
Teacher part in the film. The centuries go by, 
and now MacLeod must face his enemy, The 
Kurgan (Clancy Brown). The year is 1986; the 
place is Manhattan.
We all know the film, or at least we know about 
the film. If you havent seen it, its worth check
ing out, in any of its available forms. But the 
tenth anniversary edition is far superior. Aside 
from the deleted sequences which have now 
been restored, the picture and audio have been 
re-mastered as well. Colors are more distinct, 
and not as muddy. The LaserDisc version is a 
THX approved LaserDisc, for optimal quality in 
picture and sound. The sound has also been re
mixed and sweetened for the AC-3 Dolby Digi
tal system. The VHS version is presented in a 
widescreen (letterboxed) mode, so you will have 
to deal with the black bars on the top and bottom 
of your screen. If you cant deal with it, get a 
bigger television. On the LaserDisc version, run
ning commentary by Mulcahy and the producers 
is available on the left analog track, which al
lows one to watch the movie while the director is
talking about the scene that appears on the 
screen. For VHS users, a 20 minute segment of 
running commentary is included after the film. 
Also, the original theatrical trailer is included. 
The LaserDisc version also has a lot of supple
mental material that they couldnt put on the 
VHS. You get a lot of production photos, papers, 
reviews, information, etc.
Now personally, I think this disc is okay. Its a 
great transfer, and the cut scenes are neat, but 
the sound is a bit muddled. I may have had my 
volume down a bit low, but after the THX logo 
blared at me, I figured that when the Queen 
song burst out, it would sound cool. Instead, I 
got a couple of looks from the people I was 
watching the film with which asked, Is the 
sound up, or am I going deaf? While the supple
ments are pretty good (I actually have not yet 
watched the film with the commentary, so I 
cannot talk about that part of it), it felt a bit 
lacking. Maybe it is because I have a bunch of 
LaserDiscs with an obscene amount of supple
ments {.Terminator 2: Special Edition, Jaws, 
Goldfinger), but I think they could have in
cluded more. Perhaps they just didnt have the 
stuff we want available  a lot of things get lost 
over in Hollywood.
If you know someone who loves Highlander, 
tell them about this new release. If you order 
the video through the official Highlander website 
(http://www.highlander-official.com) by Septem
ber 30, the producers will autograph your copy 
of the film! VHS costs $19.95, and LaserDisc 
costs $69.95. But if you dont care about their 
autographs, then you can probably find it cheaper 
through mail order.
Oh, and by the way, coming out in a month or 
so is the Highlander 2: Renegade Version. This 
is (again) the directors cut of the film, with a 
difference  it was re-edited from scratch five 
years after the theatrical release. Talk about a 
venture. But Im not planning on getting it  
the original is the only one worth having. (Note 
that I restrained myself from making a really 
bad there can be only one joke!) So check out 
this film, if you have time. If not, .you can live 
with your seoond-hand washed out, scratchy, 
dirty old VHS copy for a while.

By JOHN BIGGS
Tartan Forum Editor
Remember that one with the little 
conductor guy with the big hat and 
glasses? Or the one with the Statue of 
Liberty and the Great American Melt
ing Pot? Sure you do. We all do. It was 
part of Schoolhouse Rock, a series of 
short educational cartoons that ap
peared on Saturday mornings when 
you and I were just wee bairns.
So imagine a series of thespians 
acting out this cartoon on stage. Re
member He-Man and the Masters of 
the Universe? The one with Dolf 
Lungren? Thats pret ty much what 
you get at this City Theatre produc
tion. sans Dolf.
Starring Point Park junior E. 
Clayton Cornelious as well as locals 
Jon Bicsey, Renata Carreon, Kara 
McKee, Karla E. Rosenthal, and Ja
son Michael Swauger, this musical is 
full of energy and mirth. However, 
this energy and m irth is wasted on the 
subject.
Cornelious play s a teacher who faces
his first day of class. In order to help him 
out of his under-confident funk, the rest 
of the cast appear as his al ter-egos. They 
go on to act out and sing every single 
Schoolhouse Rock in existence, includ
ing the Elbow Room and Interplanet 
Janet. The cast was excited. The audi
ence was not bored. The set was ipYpi
and whimsical. But it was Schoolhouse 
Rock, and all the joy of education cant 
change that fact.
Perfect for the nostalgic, the musical 
is a romp down memory lane. But 
throughout I was wondering: Should 
this be remembered? The cartoons were 
highly memorable and educational, but 
this display, put on for the benefit of an 
older crowd, was forced, like two old 
high school buddies resurrecting an in
side joke at your 50-year reunion. It 
might be funny, but its sad.
The nostalgic treacle that is this play 
is just fun enough to be interesting, but 
overall there is little substance. The 
three women, McKee, Carreon, and 
Rosenthal, stole the show while 
Cornelious and Bicsey added needed 
verve. The audience was incited to become involved, and two hapless 
ticket-holders were dragged 
onto the stage to Do the Circu
lation. However, little hap
pened that would warrant a 
glowing review. While some 
may recall Schoolhouse Rock 
with fondness, I recalled it with 
some difficulty. Seeing it again 
brought memories flooding 
back, hut none of them were 
tinged with the halcyon days of 
my youth. If anything, they 
made me remember all the 
times I ate too much peanut 
butter and got sick on the car
pet before my parents were 
awake.
See this if you like School
house Rock. Otherwise, steer 
clear. Its just, not worth the 
pain.
Schoolhouse Rock is playing 
at the City Theatre on Wednesday, 
Th ursday, andFriday at 8pm and 
Saturday at 5:30 and 9 pm. Call

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  23 September 1996
Kresge starts season with Sondheim
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Staffwriter
Music and drama will once 
again fill Kresge Theatre this 
Friday, as the Carnegie Mellon
Drama Series opens its sea___
son with A Stephen 
Sondheim Evening. This 
musical revue features 21 
songs from most of 
Sondheims musicals.
Sondheim, an American 
composer andlyricist known 
for his outstanding contri
butions to the musical the
ater, began his career by 
writing lyrics for West Side Story 
and Gypsy. He followed these 
successes with a series of musi
cals for which he wrote the lyrics 
and music, including Follies, A 
Funny Thing Happened On the 
Way to the Forum, Sweeney Todd, 
and most recently Into the Woods.
While the show does feature 
some of the composers more wellknown works, its singularity lies 
in its large number of less popu
lar songs. Most of the songs were 
cut from shows because of plot 
problems or are from shows that 
were never produced or had a
alumnus, and Jerry Dantry, the 
shows music director. Frisch, a 
veteran director, has directed 
more than 150 productions, in
cluding two Sondheim produc
tions, for major theaters in BosEach of the students gets his or her chance 
in the spotlight while singing Sondheims 
music which Frisch calls very demanding 
technically and emotionally/
very short run. This show is based 
on a revue first performed at the 
Whitney Museum for Sondheims 
fiftieth birthday celebration in 
1983.
Seven junior and senior drama 
students have been rehearsing 
since the end of August under the 
direction of Peter Frisch, head of 
the Drama department and CMU
ton, New York, Chicago, Wash
ington, and Los Angeles.
Each of the students gets his or 
her chance in the spotlight while 
singing Sondheims music, which 
Frisch calls very demanding 
technically and emotionally. 
Each member of the cast will have 
a chance to sing in either a solo, 
duet, or group number that show
cases his or her strengths as a 
musician and as an actor.
Frisch chose to feature 
Sondheims work because of the 
composers consistent genius 
in music and lyrics. In addi
tion to the musical quali
ties of Sondheims work, 
Frisch says that each 
song portrays a differ
ent aspect of what it 
means to be human and 
that the revue offers a 
thorough examination of 
real human issues. According to the veteran di
rector, this combination 
of musical quality and emo
tional richness makes every 
[song] a treasure to hear.
A Stephen Sondheim Evening 
will run in Kresge Theatre from 
September27 through October5 at 
8pm. Sunday matinees are sched
uledfor 2pm. Tickets can be bought 
through the Drama box office.
Apple HillMousetrap enchants audience
By MELISSA BATT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Going to grandmas house and 
seeing a play at the Apple Hill 
Playhouse are one and the same. 
Nestled in the woods of rural 
Delmont, about 30 minutes away 
from CMU, is a small, cozy 150-
lights, it looks like a small, old visiting your grandma, 
barn. Open the door to the lobby Walk up the stairs to the left, 
and you are bombarded with a and there is the stage, a relahomelike atmosphere, with tively small seating area, and a 
quilts on the tables and misbalcony. It may not seat very 
matched wooden chairs everymany, but every seat is taken, 
where. A definite apple theme Although there arent many, if 
permeates the room, with apple any, young people found in the 
posters, signs, and knick-knacks, audience of tonights showing, it
is forgotten completely after 
the curtain has gone up. 
There is no mass transit out 
in these parts, so the locals 
are the only attendees of the 
plays here.
The Mousetrap is about a 
murder mystery about a 
married couple starting 
their own business taking 
in house guests in their home 
near London, England. A 
murder takes place that is 
somehow related to the past 
lives of the visitors who have 
been snowed in for a night. 
The play is dramatically and 
energetically played by the 
cast of eight who perform at 
the Apple Hill Playhouse, 
and other places as well. This 
play draws you in, as the 
lives of the eight people por
trayed have the secrets of 
their past told, and you try to 
figure out who committed the 
murder. There promises to be a 
second killing if the inhabitants

This play, with psychological

Violence erupts in 
Last Man Standing
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Staffwriter
With Quentin Tarantinos films becoming hugely popular, 
there seems to be a resurgence of gangster films. Last Man 
Standing, from New Line Cinema, is the latest in that trend, but 
is set during prohibition, at the height of organized crime. Th 
movie stars two of Tarantinos favorites, Bruce Willis and Chris
topher Walken.
WvudLast Man Standing 
/gwpUdowWuidpw tgii 
o2IuMkypG lgMp gMp2u
Willis, the anti-hero ofthemqvie, plays a wandering badass, on 
the run from something that happened somewhere (which is 
exactly how the movie explains it) and he decides to stop in a little 
town by the name of Jericho, Texas on his way to Mexico. Jericho 
has been taken over by two rival gangs of bootleggers, who have 
established an uneasy truce at the beginning of the movie. Thats 
where our man Willis comes in and makes stuff hit the fan. Willis 
ends up manipulating both gangs, and lots of people shoot each 
other. Christopher Walken also plays a badass, and a maniac to 
boot.
This movie started out interestingly. There were loads of 
interesting camera angles and shots through dirty windows. The 
whole movie had a great dirty and gritty feel to it at the outset. 
Even the first bit of heavy violence was pretty interesting. It was 
also interesting to see Williss character manipulate the two 
gangs. But the shooting drowned out the storyline, violence for 
the sake of violence, and it wasnt even done with much flair or 
style. It was just a bunch of hardass guys getting shot, and that 
was pretty much the entire storyline. It was an entire movie 
designed to make the viewer more jaded towards seeing people 
shot.There were a couple of surprises in the movie, like the fact 
that it was based on a story co-written by Akira Kurosawa. Before 
you say, Wow, thats impressive, this movie is a retelling of that 
story. The original was Yojimbo, which means bodyguard, and 
it was about a wandering samurai who wanders into a corrupt 
Japanese town ran by two warring factions. Many of the charac
ters in Last Man Standing were nearly directly patterned after 
characters in Yojimbo, like Bruce Dems corrupt sheriff and 
Christopher Walkensbadasslrishmobster.Overall, this is agood 
movie ifyou wantto see 50 guys getshot 1050times. If you want 
flair and excitement in your violence, go for Desperado', this movie 
is just the violence. If you don't like violence, dont see this film, 
because theres little else in it.

New sitcoms seem 
slightly entertaining
ON THE TUBE
by Dan Rosenberg
Last week, the onslaught began. Fif
teen new programs premiered, and a 
few more will debut this week. I was 
hoping to catch more than three of the 
freshman series, yet an overwhelming 
amount of homework (subtle hint to 
my professors) resulted in me only 
seeing three. The three I did view, 
however, are the three sitcoms, re
ceiving the best word of mouth from 
critics and which, for the most part, 
deserve the positive buzz.
Im not really sure why Everybody 
Loves Raymond (CBS, Fridays, 8:30- 
9 pm) is being called the best new 
sitcom of the sea
son. Of the three 
shows I saw, it 
had the weakest 
pilot. It wasnt 
bad, mind you, 
but it wasnt any
thing special. It 
seems that a lot 
of critics loved the 
scene in which 
Doris Robertss 
character freaks 
out when' she 
finds out her son 
has enrolled her 
in a fruit-of-themoath club. The 
scene is mildly 
amusing, but it 
certainly couldnt 
compensate for 
the jokes that 
didnt work. Rob
erts plays <h<! 
mother of the 
shows title char
acter, a sportswriter (played by come
dian Ray Romano) with a lovely wife 
(the charming Patricia Heaton) and 
three small children. The premise is 
nothing new in television, but 
Raymond is a nice little family sitcom 
that has a lot of promise if it gets a 
better time slot.
Slightly better than Raymond is 
Michael J. Foxs Spin City (ABC, Tues
days, 9:30-10 pm). Both shows are 
equally well-written, and both pos
sess stellar supporting casts, but City 
has the better lead. Fox, who head
lined Family Ties, is a natural screen 
presence, and he brings with him the 
self-confidence that an established 
sitcom star possesses. Fox plays the
Deputy Mayor ofNew York City who, 
in the pilot, must exercise damage 
control when the inept mayor (won
derfully played by Barry Bostwick) 
inadvertently insults the gay com
munity by responding to a request to 
march in a gay pride parade with 
"Are you drunk? In addition to its 
competent cast, City has two other 
things in its favor: a great, writer and 
producer (Gary David Goldberg, who 
also produced Ties as well as the 
marvelous Brooklyn Bridge) and a 
magnificent time slot (it follows-Hbnie 
Improvement).
The best of the three shows, how
ever, is Cosby (CBS, Mondays, 8-8:30 
pm), Bill Cosbys first sitcom since 
The Cosby Show left the air in 1992. 
Although the pilot didnt really have 
a plot, it did possess three expert 
performers (Cosby, Phylicia Rashad, 
and the incomparable Madeline 
Kahn) and a riotous second act. The 
episode starts out slow, with Cosby 
simply mugging the camera and be
moaning how stupid a young dry

cleaning clerk is and then acciden
tally burning a turtle. The second 
half, however, features a brilliant bit 
of farce. Pauline (played by Kahn) 
mistakenly thinks that a napping 
Hilton (Cosby) has attempted to over
dose on sleeping pills. Her efforts to 
revive him and to get the pills out of 
his system may very well be the fun
niest bit of physical comedy all year 
(due largely to the timing of the two 
performers). Unfortunately, Cosby 
cant get by just on the talent pos
sessed by its three stars. If future 
storylines have actual plots, this show 
could become a real winner.

All About Eve
You may be asking yourself right now, Where 
did those dead ants in my hair come from? Well, 
we dont have an answer to that, but we can tell 
you about the Bette Davis movie, All About Eve.
So Davis and this other woman, Anne Baxter 
(not related to the guy in The Incredible Hulk), 
play Margo and Eve, two racy gals who become 
fast friends.
But things go awry when this guy cuts this 
womans eyeball on a balcony and Margo realizes 
that this Eve woman is trying to horn in on her 
territory by emulating her in every way. Then 
there are the cat fights.
Also starring Marilyn Monroe, this movie is the 
classic-lovers classic. Academy Award-winning 
director Joseph Mankiewicz made this movie, 
and its very good.

decide to blow up the world or make it sick or 
something. So they use freaky Connery to get in 
and foil the terrorists. Pretty basic jive, know 
what I mean, Vern?
Anyway, this is your action/adventure sort of

This movie is about all of the pesky pollens and

Actually, this movie is about the fauna of the 
Great Plains. Powerful and gripping, Heathers

On Saturday, September 21, 
the first concert of the

Music Hall on Forbes Avenue.
semble playing. While the or
chestra attempts to combine it
self with the sonorities of the 
choir, it must also act as a cham
ber ensemble with the indi
vidual soloists.
Throughout the entire 
evening, the wind section
seemed inadequate. The horns 
seemed especially out of tune 
with themselves and the vocal
ists, and the wind section failed 
to acknowledge any sort of in
terplay between themselves and 
the soloists.
The second movement showto demand an impassioned ai>d 
coherent unity from our per
formers.
Movements such as the pri
marily choral third, Eia, Mater, 
Fons Amoris, demonstrated the 
singing strengths of the

Along with four soloists,

Choir as the premiere vo

The Pittsburgh Sym
phony frequently calls 
upon the Mendelssohn 
Choir to perform major cho
ral and orchestral works, 
often with great success. 
Unfortunately, this 
evening the Mendelssohn 
Choir did not perform with 
a world renowned orches
tra, leaving the audience 
to experience a very me
diocre Stabat Mater.
The piece began on a 
troubled note. The Stabat

cased the singing 
strengths (and 
weaknesses) of our 
soloists. Soprano 
Claudia Benack 
seemed more than 
adequate but not 
totally convincing 
as the night went 
on, and Jay Baylon 
gave a consistently 
strong perfor
mance in the bassbaritone role.
Mezzo-soprano 
Nora Teipen, how
ever, had nothing 
more than a weak 
and subdued effort 
to offer, and tenor 
John Tripp was, 
aside from a few 
strong moments, 
altogether unim
pressive.
I also noticed 
relatively little in
teraction among 
the soloists during 
a piece that seems
semble as a whole produces a 
well disciplined, consistently 
strong vocal output. In fact, jit 
was their musical energy which 
provided the underlying foun
dation for the entire perfor
mance. Often times the choir/s 
strong musical presence made 
up for certain orchestral and en
semble weaknesses. The coip.-. 
bined forces of the strings arid; 
choir proved to be the greatest 
musical achievement of the 
evening.
Page has certainly kept has 
choir in extraordinary musical 
shape, but his conducting leaves 
room for improvement. Although 
Page did a fine job keeping ey* 
eryone in the musical ensemble 
together, he attempted few es 
citing dynamic changes, and his 
tempos rarely wavered from a 
moderate andante. Page, along 
with the other performers this 
evening, played it safe.
While the ensemble never fal
tered, it failed to take any rislfe 
that may have resulted in an 
exciting musical experience.;) *GeniusesWanted.
