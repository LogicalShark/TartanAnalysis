Figures Reveal Increase 
In Night School Enrollment
Colleges of Engineering and Fine Arts Gain; College 
Of Industries Shows Decrease. Attendants 
Less Than Half That in 1929 Peak
The total night school enroll
ment, as recorded at the office of 
the registrar last Thursday, show
ed a total of 1,460 students in at
tendance. This figure is practic
ally the same as that of last year, 
revealing a slight increase. -This 
year a method different from that 
of other years was employed in 
compiling the registration figures. 
In place of recording the number 
of regular and part-time students 
separately, the two were grouped 
together. This is the reason for 
the slight increase in attendance 
over that of last year.
The enrollment is distributed in 
the colleges as follows: Engi
neering, 536, an increase of 91 over 
last year; Fine Arts, 406, an in
crease of 127; and Industries, 51S, 
a decrease of 37.
Night school attendance was at 
its peak during the year 1929-30 
with a total of 3,325; SOI were reg
istered in the College of Engineer
ing. 2,055 in the College of Indus
tries, and 469 in the College of 
Fine Arts.
From 1929-30 to the present 
school year the attendance has 
shown a gradual decline: In 1930- 
31 the enrollment was 2,934, in 
1931-32, 2,120, and in 1932-33, 1,2S5,
Distribution of attendance in the 
different colleges since 1929-30 was 
as follows: College of Engineer

Rifle Team Meets 
To Plan Program
The Rifle Club and rifle team 
will meet this afternoon at 4:30 
in the Trophy Room, Gymna
sium Building. At this time 
members will arrange the pro
gram which will be carried out 
by the club during the coming 
year.
Carnegie's rifle team has al
ways ranked high in national 
competition and has repeatedly 
earned honors in the Hearst 
Competition. Because of this 
fact, the rifle team has often 
been rewarded with major let
ters, although rifle shooting Is 
listed only as a minor sport at 
Carnegie.
All students possessing any 
ability in marksmanship are 
urged to be present at this 
meeting. It is especially desir
able that a large number of 
freshmen turn out.
Conference Head 
Speaks Before 
Personnel Assoc.
Last Thursday evening Dr. 
Franklin J. Keller, director, Na
tional Occupational Conference, 
New York City, spoke to one hun
dred and fifty members of the 
Pittsburgh Personnel Association 
on Occupational Adjustments and 
the New Deal. Dr. Ben G. Gra
ham, superintendent Pittsburgh 
Public Schools, presided over the 
meeting, held in the Board of Ed
ucation Building.
 Born in New York, Dr. Keller 
went through the public schools of 
that city, graduated from the City 
College, took his Masters degree 
at Columbia, and his doctorate at 
New York University. I-Ie has been 
connected with the city school sys
tem in teaching and administra
tive capacities for twenty-seven 
years, with the exception of a 
brief period during which he 
worked on the New York Times. 
As a high school teacher his spe
cialty was English, but he put in 
a few summers . teaching wood
working.
Such versatility was rewarded by 
appointment as assistant princi
pal, and shortly after the East 
Side Continuation School was es
tablished he was selected as its 
head. That the choice was a wise 
one is indicated by the more than 
nation-wide reputation which the 
school has gained under his lead
ership. For many years his serv
ices have been in demand as a 
teacher of teachers and adminis
trators in the field of vocational 
education and guidance, and he has 
given courses in numerous summer 
schools such as those of Cornell 
University and the Albany State 
College for teachers. For four 
years he was on the faculty of his 
alma mater, the College of the City 
of New York; then transferred his 
connection to New York Univer
sity. Since 1926 he has regularly 
lectured in the Harvard Graduate 
school of Education. In leisure 
moments he wrote the book on

EDDIE WETZ TO 
PLAY AT XAVIER 
FOOTBALL DANCE
J. Clifton Carr Arranges 
Decorative Feature 
Witli Balloons
Eddie Weltz
Eddie Weitz and his Pennsylva
nians, an orchestra popular 
campus last year, will play at the 
Xavier Football Dance in Thistle 
Hall this Sat
urday night. 
This is the 
bands first en
gagement on 
campus since 
last years 
Spring Carni
val, when it 
furnished the 
music at the 
Coronat ion 
Ball and the 
Costume Ball. 
Music will 
begin at 9 o'clock and continue un
til 12. Tickets will bo sold only 
at the door at the usual admission 
price of $-1.00 per couple.
J. Clifton Carr, social chairman 
of Student Council, has arranged 
a special decorative and entertain
ing feature for the dance. Balloons 
in the Xavier colors will be hang
ing above the dancers and, at a 
certain time, will descend among 
them. In one of the balloons the 
lucky finder will receive a ticket 
entitling him to a box of candy. 
This novel arrangement is in line 
with the plans Student Council is 
formulating for these regular Sat
urday night football dances. Ac
cording to these plans some such 
unusual touch will provide an 
amusing feature for those attend
ing the dance.
During the course of this dance, 
which is being held in honor of the 
game played in Cincinnati Satur
day afternoon, the score of the 
game will be announced for the 
benefit of those who have not yet 
heard it.
Chaperons for the dance will in
clude Mr. and Mrs. Maurice L. Car
roll, Mr. and Mrs. Allen Risedorph, 
Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Miller, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Bradley.
Mr. A.E. Fisher 
Publishes Third
Novel, Requiem
A. E. Fisher, a member of the 
faculty of the Department of Eng
lish and Psychology, has recent'y 
published his third novel, Re
quiem, which, in its literary sig
nificance, has been of such import
ance as to cause a great deal of 
comment in the book sections of 
leading newspapers and maga
zines.
In plot the book presents the 
life of a lower middle class Amer
ican family during one grimly 
eventful week, from Sunday morn
ing to Saturday night, in which 
time, the father is killed, the 
daughter married, and the broth
ers involved in a violent quarrel; 
the sun shines, the rain falls, and 
the radio runs steadily on. The 
setting is Pittsburgh at the time 
of the taxicab strike several years 
ago.
But it is not in the development 
of the story that Mr. Fishers 
novel is exceptional in the run of 
current fictions; rather it is be
cause it indicates a change in cul
tural trends. The New Republic 
of October 4 makes a comment to 
the effect that Mr. Fishers novel 
represents an attempt to create a 
character who reacts to the crises 
of the depression by rising above 
Ills environment. Becoming steeled 
and hardened by suffering, he is 
equipped to make the sacrifices 
that present day society demands. 
Such a character is new in post
war literature, for until this time 
fiction has portrayed chiefly those 
figures broken and dulled by great 
calamities and Budden turns in 
human life and rarely the progress 
of those enlightened and hardened 
through their trials.
Mr. Fishers two previous novels 
were "To the Sun and "Marriage 
in Blue. but Mr. Fisher himself 
feels that these were both mere'y 
stunts in writing, whereas Re
quiem is decidedly an attempt to 
portray a definitely growing situa
tion.

Enterprising Reporter Discovers
Campus Most Worried Individual
By Jacque Minnotte
Admittedly the question is not 
one of national import, but never
theless your reporter was more 
than interested as he sought the 
answer to the query: Who on the 
campus sleeps least the night be
fore the seasons opening football 
game?
Is it the head coach about to 
make his debut in major football 
competition? Is it the sophomore 
halfback scheduled to start in the 
next days contest? Perhaps its 
the graduate manager of athletics 
whos just read a prediction for 
rain on the morrow? Wrong again.
To avoid going on like this far 
into the night, ad infinitum, we 
present herewith, in the person of 
the drum major of the college 
band, the answer to our question.
Let it be recorded now that he 
who is troubled most by insomnia 
the night before the game Is none 
other than this knight of the baton 
who is about to make his first ap
pearance at the head of his college 
band before a stadium crowd.
Just ,-liow do these tall, slim, 
high-stepping youths feel In the 
days and hours before that mo
ment when, with a whistle, they 
start their column of marchers 
down the stadium greensward?
Let's listen to Bill Sharp, drum 
major of the Kiltie Band, who 
made hfs debut at the Temple 
game, Saturday, as he expounds on 
the workings of a major's mind: 
From the comfortable distance of 
a week or two, that initial march 
down the field appears safely in 
the distance, but as the opening 
game draws near, and I brush up
on my stunts and maneuvers, there 
come to my mind all sorts of 
nerve-racking thoughts. I wake in 
the middle of the night dreaming 
that I've dropped my baton on the 
fifty-yard line. I dream of for
getting a maneuverand finding 
myself all alone on one side of 
the field without my band. Or 
there comes to mind the pleasant 
thought of tripping over my own 
feet as I toss them high, to go 
sprawling on the turf, and run over 
by my oncoming marchers.
I try to reassure myself with 
the thought that history records 
no case of a life ruined because of 
a dropped baton, but the attempt 
is futile.
"Friday night is a nightmare. I 
think of catching a train for homo, 
of feigning illness or of incapaci
tating, myself by breaking a finger. 
I wonder if other drum majors 
have suffered the same torture and 
I cant make myself believe that 
they have.
"Then comes memory of that 
local boy makes good picture of 
me in the home town paper folowed by the thought, of same "local 
boy falling in a faint as he pre
pares to march into the stadulm.
"I toss and toss most of I ho 
night, hut toward morning sleep 
comes from exhaustion. Then, ris
ing about ten oclock for breakfast, 
I think of those death-house pic
tures of the condemned slayer ris
ing for his last meal. Fond is 
tasteless. I twirl my knife and 
fork automatically as though they 
were batons and close mv eyes as 
one falls from my hand. Then into

Carnegie Instructors Enter 
International Exhibition
Kostellow, Rosenberg, Hilton and Edmund Exhibit 
1 aintings; All Are Well Known as Painters 
And Teachers of Fine Arts
Carnegie is assured of a strong 
place in the coming International 
Exhibit due to the fact that four 
members of the faculty from tho 
Department of Painting and Decor
ating are contributing. Alexander 
J. Kostellow, Samuel Rosenberg, 
Roy Hilton and Esther Topp Ed
mond can now bo added to the list 
of instructors from Carnegie who 
have participated in this world 
famous exhibit. Previous exhibits 
have included the works of Ed
mond M. Ashe, Norwood MacGilvary and Raymond Siiuboli, but 
never before has Carnegie been 
represented by so strong an array 
of talent as this present group dis
plays.
All of this group possess excel
lent reputations as teachers but 
this, by no means, obscures tho re
nown Iho^. nave earned for them
selves as painters, Mr. Kostellow.
who won a prize at. the last annual 
show of tho Associated Artists, 
can be expected to display origi
nality as well as sound craftsman
ship, in both color and composition. 
Mr. Rosenberg, who is well known 
for his courageous, restless atti
tude, can be relied upon to display 
these qualities in his work. Mr. 
Hiltons strong point in his fino 
sense of structural design. Tho 
pattern of his composition is al
ways pleasing to the eye and his 
paintings possess a remarkable 
feeling for rhythm and balance. 
Miss Edmonds has studied a good 
deal in Paris and will, in all prob
ability, offer something forceful 
and original.
Carnegie thus enters the Thirtyfirst International Exhibition with 
a feeling of pride and with high 
hopes of carrying off some of the 
honors.

Life of Stephen Foster 
Is Recorded in Poetry
Tn the October Issue of Scrib

"Stephen Collins Foster, by Tlanlel Long, a former professor of 
English at Oarnoglo, will appear. 
Mr. Long was for many yearn n 
professor here, but III health 1'orcod 
him to roslgn.
While at Carnegie ho started the 
Foster" poem. It Is a biography 
of Fester In which there Is no 
glorification of tho Pittsburgh pool, 
and song-writer. Instead his'sketch 
of him is trenchant and bitter. Mr 
Long is known as a sensitive, im
aginative poet, and this long poem 
possesses these qualities to a very , 
great extent.

2TUE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY. OCTOBER 10, 1933
THE 
TUESDAY 
QUARTERBACK 
 o
BY JACK LOWES
YE SCRIBE IS GOING ABOUT THE CAMPUS with one of thono "I 
told you no" omlleo thlo week: In fact ho looko very much like a cat 
who has Juot uwallowed the canary. Laot week I wao uo rash ao to 
predict a two touchdown victory for Carneglo Tech, and the abuse I 
rocclvcd from the varlouo wlao (juyn wao very humiliating Indeed. I 
was informed that I didnt know which oido was up, that Temple had 
ono of tho moot powerful toamo In the caot, and that the Tartano 
wcro lucky to get out of tho pmo allvo. Tho managing editor of thio 
rag oven picked up a hot at 3 to 1 on Temple, and thooe rldlcuiouo 
bear stories published by Coach Harpoter In one of the evening papero 
laot week didn't help my reputation any.
* * * * * *
HANDING OUT THE BOUQUETS FOR LAST SATURDAYS PER
FORMANCE Iu extremely difficult, inasmuch an LJie whole quad 
played such a superior brand of bull that Individual honor wore really 
reduced to a minimum. IL wan tho lino, however, that really made 
tho difference between a hard-fought, close decision and tho rout 
which tho game finally turned out to be. Outweighed fifteen pounds 
to the man, the Carnegie lino outclassed tho opposition In every de
partment of the game. The ends, especially, made the Owls look very 
sad at times. Those two beautiful passes snared by Lib Lewis should 
certainly make tho Washington, Pa., natives happy, for their favorite 
on Jh certainly the man of the hour. On the defense, Stewart, Lewis 
and Bursdo broke up most of the Owl plays before they wore really 
under way. Tho Tartan captain gave further notice that he Is out for 
national honors tills season.
In tho. backilold, Coach Harpster gavo warning to all future Tech 
opponents that he bus about the shiftiest array of runners seen In 
these parts for several seasons. Terobus and Bill Splsalc are due to 
imnd out plenty of misery before tho your Is over, and when it comes 
to out und out line cruclcing Johnny Suyios bus few peers.
Carnegie wus handicapped throughout the second quarter by poor 
punting, but that Bentleyvilie terror, Dutch Croft, mudo up for his 
faulty boots by his phenomenal line pluy.
******
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE THE TARTANS HAVE TO CONTEND 
WITH now is ovcrconfldcnce. Teams like Notre Dame, Purdue, Pitt,
ond Michigan State will not stand around and be pushed over like 
Temple was Saturday. It takes more than ono good game to send a 
team to tho Rose Bowl, and although Harpster has no such ambitious 
hopes this season, lie can do well to keep the hat sizes of hie men at 
the same old figure. Even Xavier should not be taken too lightly, for 
ft muBt be remembered that the Cincinnatians arc about the best of 
tho Class B teams.******
CARNEGIE TECHS FUTURE OPPONENTS, almost without excep
tion, found the going very rough against what were supposed to be 
only pushovers. Probably the most surprising of ull wus the defeut 
of N. Y. U. by West Virginia Wesleyan. I happened to see the Duauosne-W. Va. Wesleyan debacle down here in Forbes Field a couple 
Of woelcs ugo, and I must say Lluvt I huve seldom seen a college footbull teum quite us wealc us the moonshine stute team wus that night.
For those who are interested in such technicalities I am listing the 
cores of the future antagonists of tho Plaid eleven:

From the ubovo statistics it may be seen that only Xavier lived 
up to expectations, although Michlgah Stute must huve put up one 
whulo of u buttle against a grout Michigan machine.******
nmustbeau lisl reasy ostamuem lpwoibphav about everyono was credited with throwing that pans except tho guy who actually 
throw It. Ono newspaper statod that Spencer had tossed It, while an
other averred that It was Charlie Splsak who made the fling. The lad 
who actually did do tho flipping wao none other than Owen Bowser, 
the Parkersburg pride and Joy.

The Curnegle teum proved to be 
unotiier fut sturter, the varsity 
needing three plays for a touch
down, the scrubs requiring one. 
The Tartans defense was a beauty 
to behold. The only time the Plaid 
line wusnt in the Temple backiield was during the huddle. Tem
ple passers lost more than forty 
yards In three plays when the 
Techites rushed through a leaky 
forwurd wull to smear the tosser 
ull over the back field. The Warner 
boys opened up with another 
screwy double shift system that 
pulled the boy offside till they 
got onto the double movement. 
The triple reverses were too slow 
In starting, und the Tartans were 
nil over the bull currier on every 
one of them. The whole Tech line 
played u sterling-game of football, 
being in position on every play on 
the defense und opening up such 
holes us Terebus dualled through 
for u touchdown on the offense. 
The passing for Carnegie was an
other lino feature of the contest. 
Out of live completed pusses for 
Tech throe of them were touch

attack promises to be a serious 
menace to Carnegie's opponents.
The punting of both teams wus 
notoriously rotten, tho averages be

Carnegie Quarterback Anxious To 
Show Wares Against Notre Dame
By JIM HUGHES
Ono of Carnegies greatest needs 
this year is a good strong player 
to fill the quarterbuclc position 
agulnst Notre Dume. und we huve 
him in Angelo Bevevino, one of the 
lute Knute Rocknes own former 
proteges.
Bevies secondury educution 
was received at Warren, Pu., High 
School. While there, he mude a 
name for himself in scholastic ath
letic circles by starring in both 
football und basketball.
With this.record behind him, he 
set out for Notre Dame. When he 
entered the portuls of tliut famous 
Institution, he enrolled as u 
Mechanical Engineer.
After being duly enrolled as a 
member of the freshman class, he 
set out to -make a place for him
self on the Irish football team. 
During tliut year, lie pluyed quar
terback on the frosh team us un 
understudy to Jaskwlch. However, 
his desire Lo some duy be a Me
chanical Engineer interfered with 
Ills future as a quarterbuclc on 
one of the Rockne-coaclied teams. 
Mr. Rocknes verdict hwd that 
Bevevino would huve to give up 
either quarterbacking or Mechan
ical Engineering. Being u man of 
strong will and powerful ambi
tions, lie decided to be both, and 
so after one year at Notre Dame 
he came to Carnegie.
Since lie changed his Alma Mater 
Lo our own, he has made a very 
good record. For the past two 
years ho has played substitute 
quarterback on the Carnegie var
sity, and tills year he shows signs 
of blossoming out ' Into a truly 
great player. He is a marvelous 
pnsser und u good field genernl, 
good evidence of which he gave in 
the game against our old rival, 
Temple, during Inst Saturday's 
gume.
So when the Plaid teum linos up 
against tho boys from South Bend 
on October 21, Bevie will bo out 
to show Ills old school tliut a mun 
can bo a Mechanical Engineer and, 
still bo n great football player.
Notre Dame Is 
Opening Foe for 
Tartan Harriers
Carnegie has fine prospects for 
a successful cross-country season 
this year. The season opens with 
a meet against Notre Dame on Sat
urday, October 21, in Schenley 
Park. Ten well-seasoned runners 
will be there to compete for Car
negie, being captained by Shorey 
Allan. The team is ubout the 
strongest this year that it has 
been in all past years, including in 
its line-up two of the past cross
country captains, Bob Schell, that 
of last year, and Ramsey, captain 
of the team two years ago. Adding 
greatly to the strength of the team 
are Frank Giolma and Roger Burke, 
who are both runners of no mean 
ability. Others of the Tartan har
riers are Neff, Netzer, Carr, Wal
ters, and Babin. The teum lius a 
very attractive schedule with other 
schools of note in this district, to
taling five meets in all. Besides 
the Notre Dame meet, there will 
be that with the University of 
Pittsburgh held on the Schenley 
Park course, November 10. All 
other meets will be held on the 
grounds of the opposing teams.
The Freshman cross-country can
didates are practicing daily. All 
Plebe runners should report for 
practice every afternoon ut 4:30. 
The freshmuh team has no formal 
schedule this year, but it will par
ticipate in several meets with high 
schools about the city.

COACHES START 
PRACTICE FOR 
ST. XAVIER TILT
Plaid Big Favorites to 
Defeat Ohioans in 
Second Battle
Refusing to make the mistake of 
underrating anybody on this years 
suicide schedule, Coach Howard 
Harpster began drill Monday after
noon for this coming Saturdays 
tussle with St. Xavier at Cincin
nati. The Carnegie gridmen are 
naturally overwhelming favorites 
to beat the Ohioans, but the Plaid 
mentor is determined not to allow 
any slip-ups.
The Xavier game was scheduled 
as a breather between the hard 
struggles with Temple and Notre 
Dame, but last year the Saints 
gave the Steffen machine a battle 
royal, the latter finally winning 
out, 15 to nix.
The Cincinnati school should 
furnish an excellent warmup for 
the Notre Dame struggle a week 
from Saturday, inasmuch as they 
use the Notre Dame style of at
tack. Xavier has an excellent 
record with teams of its own class, 
and they are really pointing for 
the Skibos. Last Saturday they 
scored a decisive victory over 
Adrian College to the tune of 25-0.
The lineup for the Tartans is of 
course problematical, but its a 
cinch that it wont be much differ
ent from that which started against 
Temple Saturday.

Trackmen Start 
Practice Within 
Next Few Days
Carnegies swimming team starts 
practice next week with three of 
last years veterans missing from 
the squad. A replacement has not 
yet been found for the stellar 
Pal Miller though there are 
many free-stylers to be found in 
the ranks. Captain Lachance will 
probably swim the 50 and 100 with 
Leavitt of last years Plebe squad. 
Holiday may be shifted from his 
backstroke specialty to the free
style and Yonder Lancken, last 
years breast stroker, may also be 
on the relay team. One veteran 
and four sophomores will be out 
for the distance competition, Jerge, 
Ackerman, Dennison, Hughes, and 
Charles.
With Boyer and Holiday in the 
backstroke the squad should clean 
up in this event as both have been 
clocked in excellent times. Vonder Lancken has a breast stroke 
position cinched with Culler and 
Marshall running for the second 
position.
Kuhn, varsity diver will be ably 
replaced by Preston, one of the 
best divers the school has had. 
Bright, Bostwick, and Reese will 
be after the position as second 
man in diving.

an invaluable contribution to the 
literature of education.
Other activities in addition to 
his worlc as principal of the East 
Side Continuation School have in
cluded service as executive secre
tary of the Commission on School 
Finance and Administration, ap
pointed by the Governor of New 
York in 1926; and as director of 
the Vocational Survey Commission 
of Now York City, appointed in 
1931. From 1930 to 1932 ho was 
chairman of the Coordination Com
mittee which had control of the 
lleld secretarys oftlce of the Na
tional Vocational Guidance Asso
ciation, before that part of tho 
work was taken over by the Na
tional Occupational Conference.
This group, administered through 
the American Association for Adult 
Education, is interested in all as
pects of occupational adjustment, 
and in co-operative efforts to study 
this problem. At present It is con
cerned primarily with assembling 
information about occupations, and 
making such information available 
to the public through effective pub
lication. Tho Conference seeks to 
encourage research in fields where 
adequate information is not avail
able at present, and maintains at 
headquarters an index of published 
information on all occupations.
The Conference also provides, 
for educational institutions, libra
ries, and other Interested organiza
tions, as consulting service regard
ing the theory and practice of vo
cational guidance, and tho results 
of research in occupational adjust
ment. No charge is made for any' 
assistance which can be given by 
mail. Upon request, a staff oni
cer of the Conference will visit 
local institutions for consultation 
regarding tho organization of work 
designed to contribute to the hot
ter occupational adjustment of 
more than one person. The work 
of the Conferonco does not include 
counseling with individuals regard
ing thoir personal occupational 
problems.
Plaid Positions 
Open to StudentsIdle Thoughts 
of an 
Idle Night 
Student
All those night students who 
did not receive a night student 
handbook at tne time of registra
tion can secure a copy by tender
ing their registration card at the 
cashiers oflice any evening or in 
the student council oftlce.
This applies particularly to 
those students who registered prior 
to the regular registration even
ings or during the daytime. This 
book contains much valuable in
formation regarding the various 
phases of night school life and all 
students would do well to secure 
a copy of this book and carefully 
read It.
Phi Mu, the night school social 
fraternity, will open its autumn 
social program with a masquerade 
dance on Saturday, October 28. 
On that evening the fraternity will 
entertain members and friends in 
tho Colonial Studios at 1(520 Mur
ray avenue with dancing and cards 
beginning at nine o'clock. A1 Buhl 
and his orchestra will furnish tho 
music and an appropriate luncheon 
will bo served.
Following tho activity policy of 
last year tho social committee has 
planned an attractive calendar for 
tho new school term. Among the 
events outlined are a stag party in 
November, a card party and a 
dance In Thistle Hall in December. 
Theso and other prospective affairs 
promise many pleasant evenings 
during the school year.
The Plaid staff has three po
sitions open to night students 
who would like to write for a 
college newspaper and repre
sent their school on the night 
school staff.
Students wishing to try out 
for these positions are request
ed to report at the Publication 
office, Room 12, in the Indus
tries Building, this Friday night 
at 7:30 p. m. Do not send in 
your application as personal in
terviews only are desired.
With a new social season about 
to begin the Night Student Couucil 
once more solicits the assistance 
of the student body in order to 
successfully conduct these affairs. 
In a very short while social com
mittees will be appointed and the 
entire program will get under way.
Work done on any affair on the 
campus leads to an insignia award 
at the end of the school year. This 
insignia is awarded annually by 
the Night Student Council when 
the work done by the student earns 
him the required number of points.
On page thirty of the Night Stu
dent Carnegie Handbook, that was 
received at the time of registration, 
will be found a complete and de
tailed explanation of this insignia 
award. Students are urged to read 
this carefully and familiarize them
selves with the regular routine fol
lowed.
Last year several students did 
not receive an award as the total 
number of points earned was not. 
sufficient. The Council provides 
that a majority of theso points 
shall be credited to the student 
again this year, thus giving the 
student a good start toward an in
signia for this year.
Any student desiring to enter 
into student activities work is re-! 
quested to send his or her name to 
the Night Student Council, Box 
137, and then watch this page for 
notices when to report for the var
ious activities.
Usual Routine
That's over  registration, of 
course. It was a great game while 
it lasted. I was on the giving end 
part of the time, then it changed 
when I was on the receiving end 
and finally I came out of the game 
with more dope, books, slips and 
schedule cards than one could 
shake a stick at. Not having more 
than two hands, and my hands beng full, I was handicapped for the 
jvenlng, so went home.
The starting of school the next 
night after the registration period 
was an innovation and should 
prove of value. More time can now 
be spent on assignments later on, 
and perhaps, maybe, we will get 
more vacations. This would even 
up a bit for starting so early in 
the season. There I go, trying to 
fit a round schedule into a square 
hole or sumpin.
Registration? Registration? 
Check it off. Weve done it again. 
Did worrying about schedules, long
er and longer lines, hidden room 
numbers, yellow sheets of paper as: 
long as the lines, little yellow 
cards, instructors, tuition, drive you 
to such extremes as biting finger 
nails and tearing hair? Maybe not, 
but we all had that worried look. 
We just couldnt take it.
The walk across the cut was 
pleasant. -Monday, Tuesday, and 
Wednesday were clear, autumn 
evenings. There was no need to 
hurry. Depression, they said. 
You neednt rush. There wont 
be many registering this year; 
they wont have the money. Why, 
youll be through all the writing 
and signing and paying in less than 
twenty minutes this time. Then 
why were all the parking spaces 
filled? Why were they driving 
'round and round hunting a place 
to sneak In? And then it occurred 
to you that perhaps you werent the 
only night school student walking 
across the campus. Better walk 
a little faster.
Sothrough the door and up the 
steps we tripped. Then where? 
Well, we thought we would look 
around first. We were sorry we 
looked. They clustered and swarm
ed around the Exhibition room 
door. Now we knew wed better 
go on upstairsquickly.
There were ten ahead of us. We 
waited through five interviews 
standing up; the other five, sitting 
down. Everyones facial . expres
sion became standard: the begin
ning of that worried look. Then 
the lady said, "You're next.
Name? (We knew later that it 
would have been more convenient 
to have been numbered than
The new Kiltie emblem, designed 
by Henry E. Mnuro and Mr. Mc
Donald, which will be used on 
brooch pins and belt buckles.
named). You want me to give you 
your permit to register? What 
subjects? Cant be done. That 
conflicts with this. Perhaps you 
could take this instead. All right? 
Now, take this and this and that 
and go there and there. (Tra-la-la. 
Here, there, and everywhere.) 
Then go to the Exhibition room, 
and theyll tell you what to do next. 
Youre welcome.
At the Exhibition room we 
swarmed amid the swarm of other 
swarmers. It didnt last forever 
not quite. And before wo really ex
pected it. we were sitting at a table 
learning how to print our name. 
This printing practice is good for 
you. Dont believe otherwise. 
After this practice people are able 
to sit down and at a moments no
tice print their names right off 
without any hesitation. Of course 
there are some (there always are) 
who, no matter how often they have 
registered, never quite get the idea. 
They stillponder over how to 
cross a, "t or whether to write the 
"y completely above the line or 
half below the line. These people 
never learn, anyway.
Then to the Gymnasium.  They 
had it roped off^-circus style. All 
we needed were colored balloons 
and sawdust. Up one aisle; down 
another. Soon we spied a table 
far in the distance. There were 
some people around it. They fig
ured up your tuition. Then past 
the girls at the typewriters and on 
to the cashiers desk. They took 
tills and gave you back thatal
ways giving you back more than

buckles for use ou tlio uniforms.
The emblems are made of tho 
new stainless metal. U. S. S. 18-S, 
highly polished, a product fur
nished by the American Sheet and 
Tin Plato Company, and will re
tain their brilliancy under all the 
trying conditions which tho uni

done by the Panier Brothers Stamp

defrayed by Mr. McDonald.
The band wore the new emblems 
for the first time at tho CarnogieTemple game last Saturday when 
they adorned the spick-and-span 
uniforms just returned from a com
plete rejuvenation.
The latest Night Student Car
negie Handbook, Volume 9, has 
made its appearance and reveals 
a well compiled book that should 
be of value to all night students.
Following the foreword of Ches
ter J. Biscup, editor, comes the 
usual letter of welcome to night 
students from Dr. Baker. Then 
comes the social calendar which, 
no doubt, will receive considerable 
attention.
A history of the Night Student 
Council preceeds the constitution 
of the council and should be of 
general interest.
The sections relating to the Night 
Student Council and its various 
phases and activities are particu
larly called to your attention. 
Valuable information is contained 
herein and all students should read 
this portion very carefully.
Another portion of the book deals 
with the insignia awards made an
nually by the Council. Just how 
a student shall go about earning 
this insignia, and its history, is 
fully explained and should be 
given special attention.
The last portion of the book is 
devoted to places of interest on the 
campus, night school fraternities, 
college songs and cheers, a com
plete diary and memorandum.
Dr. Charles Herty, Jr. 
Offers Lecture Series
Dr. Charles H. Herty, Jr., direc
tor of research for tho metallurgi
cal advisory board at Carnegie, 
has been secured by tho College of 
Engineering as a lecturer on metal
lurgy.
Dr. Herty will conduct a course 
in "The Fundamentals and Theory, 
of Open Hearth Practice," which 
will bo open to aualified metal
lurgists in the district, seniors, 
and graduate students at Carnegie. 
The course will bo given In the 
night school and classos will meet 
on Monday evenings.
At the Bureau of Minos and later 
with tho advisory board, Dr. I-Ierty 
has done brilliant work in the 
physical chemistry of stool mak
ing. His studies have boon closoly 
followed by the steel industry, and 
there have boon many demands 
from metallurgists in tho district 
that ho bo added as a locturor on 
metallurgy.
A glance around the gymnasium 
convinced me that the perambula
tion walks were not the only im
provements made during the sum
mer. I noticed that there were 
new pipes lowered from the ceiling 
supporting baskets. What a change, 
and what an improvement? The 
night men will not have such a 
time tugging at the basket racks 
when preparing for the dances 
from now on. There will be less 
work to do for the dances, may
be. Wonder whose Idea it was to 
put the new basket racks in for 
the basketball games?
they took away. Only two more 
desks. They stamped some things 
and handed you more little books. 
Thendone! No. There was a 
rope there. Were we to'say there 
awhile for some reason? No 
they seemed to bo disiQgardlng 
that rope. It must have been le
gal; there was an officer standing 
there watching them hurdle over 
or duck under. We ducked.
We hurried home, empued our 
pockets and tried to flguro out all 
the printed materialwhole stack3 
of It. And, having puzzled it all 
out, what does it mean anyway? 
Oh, just that were going to school 
another year.
1908 PICTURES WANTED
Tho Historical Committee of 
Carnegie will have an exhibit of 
pictures of tho class of 190S in tho 
Trophy room for tho seventh an
nual Alumni Homecoming. Please 
send any picturos or information 
concerning members of that class 
to Doan Tnrboll.
Fronm the looks of things, that 
s, the registration lines, maybe, 
:here wont be a drop in registra
tion after all. I was pleased to 
see all the familiar faces back 
again to greet us. Sorta made me 
feel that 1 was on familiar ground. 
And all the information tables 
where the instructors were sitting 
ready to give you the necessary 
dope on this and that. Who 
wouldn't go to night school?
My prediction about parking 
seems to be true. The first oiight 
of registration brough the problem 
to the front. Many a student drove, 
md drove, only to find that the 
learest place was about a quarter 
if a mile away from the place lie 
ranted to be. I did notice that 
ome were able to get their cars 
n on the liill-side street paralleling 
lie side of the gymnasium. This 
ised to be restricted territory in 
n-evious years, but I guess a 
hange of heart or safety or someliing has made the space availale for parking.
And speaking of parkingI was 
imused at the severity of some of 
he officers who policed the streets 
idjacent to the campus. It seems 
;hat at a certain spot a concerted 
ffort was made to chase the 
hauffeurs away just as they finish
ed parking their cars, which by the 
vny only extended a couple of 
inches over the yellow 'line. Too 
ad, those yello\)v lines were paint:d on the curbs as tell tales.
And the question of yellow lines 
! rings to my mind another parlcig. what shall I saynecessity, 
icility, adjunctyou name It. At 
11 events, wouldnt it be a great 
hing if lines were drawn, painted 
f you have a mind to, on the parlcng area so as to accommodate 
nore cars? There is no reason 
vhy this couldnt be done and think 
)f the additional number of cars 
which could park closer to the 
campus. Just a little bucket of 
paint, a brush or two, and a magic 
solution of the parking problem 
would be found. Maybe well get it 
before long.
