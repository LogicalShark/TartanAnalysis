that intellect has to be tempered

it is just as important to teach

back at the kinds of achievements 
that our people have had, we are

Mehrabian.
He cited events such as CMUs

and Carnegie Meltons place as

work to the Internet.
what field they come from.... The 
advantage that they enjoy is that 
they have learned by doing, they 
have practiced the theory, they 
have learned problem solving, 
so that when they see a new 
problem they know they can 
draw on their experience. That 
is their competitive advantage. 
Now, today it is imperative for 
us to ensure that that competi
tive advantage is sustainable
throughout their career, said 
Mehrabian.
By any measure, in this cen
tury weve excelled. Weve excelled 
because of fine people on our cam

that weve received from our 
alumni and friends, he said.

Network 2000 transforms campus network infrastructure
3y GIL ALTEROVITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
 During the past few months, Computng Services has been working on transprming the campus network. The pro
gram, named Network 2000, will be 
implemented in phases. Eventually, 
Network 2000 will bring higher band
width (the width, of a data pipeline) 
lervices to every building on the Cariegie Mellon campus, said Erikas 
Japjus, manager of Network Developnent at Computing Services. Carnegie 
ttellon is working closely with.network 
ifluipment vendor Cisco Systems on the 
iroject.
The Network 2000 initiative officially 
tarted in January 1996. However,
[Computing Services has] been work
ing on various iterations of the same,, 
basic network design since 1990, said 
Napjus. From March to May of this 
year, the infrastructure was evaluated 
at Cyert Hall.
During the summer, Computing Ser
vices discussed the initiative with ven
dors and ordered the equipment. The 
goal of Network 2000 is to deploy the 
new system in all academic buildings on 
campus, including the computing clus
ters, by Fall 1997 with dorms and frater
nities to follow.
Over the last twelve months, we [Com
puting Services] have been quietly de
ploying fast ethemet operating at 100 
Mbps [megabits per second]... through
out the core infrastructure of the campus network, noted Napjus.
According -tjjp a press release, the 
Network 2000 infrastructure enables 
campus network users to move from 
a shared 10 megabits per second 
(Mbps) connection ... to either a 
switched 10 Mbps connection or a 
shared 100 Mbps connection. In the 
current shared 10 Mbps shared con
nection, all machines on a given net
work segment share the 10 Mbps ca
pacity, while the switched 10 Mbps 
allows each machine to have its own 
maximum 10 Mbps capacity. A shared 
100 Mbps connection gives a machine 
access to a shared network segment 
whose maximum capacity is 100 Mbps. 
(ten times more than the current 
maximum).
Since around the beginning of this 
sehool year; the new system infrastruc
ture has been deployed in five academic 
buildings: Cyert Hall, Mellon Institute, 
Hamerschlag Hall, Wean Hall, and 
Baker/Porter Hall. In the near future, 
five more academic buildings will be 
added to that list, according to Charles 
Bartel, director of operations at Com
puting Services.
In addition, Napjus said some up
grades were made in the dorms over 
this past summer in preparation for the 
eventual migration over to the Net
work 2000 infrastructure. [Comput
ing Services] upgraded the router serv
ing the dormitories both to link into the 
core Network 2000 infrastructure as 
well as to provide a path toward up
grading all of the dormitories to Net
work 2000 service.
Napjus said that a change [in the 
network infrastructure] was necessary 
to cope with the increased use and 
importance of high bandwidth network 
connectivity. Network usage has been 
more than doubling every year since 
the advent of the World Wide Web, 
noted Bartel.
Increased network bandwidth 
would be a boon to web-based applica
tions and multimedia computing, ac
cording to Bartel, It was clear that 
the campus would need a new genera
tion of campus networking to support 
these new uses of networks and com
puting.

Pittsburgh technology 
firms seek CMU students
.BY ANNE RAY
.Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Many Carnegie Mellon students 
looking for a job in a technical field, 
especially computer programming, 
think that the Silicon Valley in Cali
fornia is the place to be. But re
cently, 26 Pittsburgh-based compa
nies congregated at the pgh.cafe to 
jshow CMUs technical community 
otherwise.
The pgh.cafe was a conference 
iheld last Tuesday for Carnegie Mel
lon students to interact with local 
software companies. Its organiz
ers, The Pittsburgh High Technol
ogy Council, noticed a problem with 
the amount of Pittsburgh-area university graduates who attend col
lege in Pittsburgh and move away 
to get a job. The Council formed a 
jfocus group comprised of 19 CMU 
Computer Science undergradu
ates.
We asked them, What do you 
know [about Pittsburgh software 
companies]? said Jay Douglass, 
member of the technical staff of the 
Software Engineering Institute 
(SEI). Can you name some compa
res in Pittsburgh? Turns out they 
didnt know anything. So we asked 
them what might entice them to 
remain in Pittsburgh. They wanted 
to know [if] they could stay in Pitts
burgh and work on cool, innovative 
Projects. They wanted a sense of
community. [The @pgh.cafe] is our 
first attempt to prove that sense of 
community and that there are strong 
job opportunities in Pittsburgh.
Over the course of the afternoon, 
students met with representatives 
from software companies, heard 
representatives from the Pitts
burgh High Technology Council and 
the mayor of Pittsburgh, Tom 
Murphy, speak about the growth 
and potential of Pittsburgh, and 
saw software demonstrations by 
each company in McConomy Audi
torium.
David Schroeder, vice-president of 
U.S. Connect Strategy One, com
mented on why students have a good 
reason to stay in Pittsburgh after 
graduation. Instead of living 
crammed in a loft in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, you can buy a house 
in Pittsburgh if you save up for a 
few years. Pittsburgh is a more liv
able city. Its much easier to have a 
life. Part of the reason students dont 
stay is that we cant pay the same 
salaries, but if you add in the hassle 
factor, and cost of living, 
[Pittsburghs] more attractive.
Some students dont feel the same, 
however. Sophomore Russell Joseph, 
an ECE major, said that Pittsburgh 
isnt what he would want on a long 
term basis.
Particularly for ECE and computer 
science (CS), theres a substantial

Organization protests college rankings
FUNC calls for magazine to change methods
By MEENA VAGNIER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In response to an overwhelming sense 
of disappointment with the U.S. 
Newsr&nkings of colleges, many univer
sities and student-run organizations have 
gotten together to form a. coalition called 
FUNC, Forget U.S . News Coalition. 
This group originated at Stanford Uni
versity in its student govern_________
ment group, the Association 
of Stanford Students Union 
(ASSU). For years now,U.S.
News has been compiling and 
publishing yearly rankings of 
the best schools in the coun
try, and recently questions 
have been raised about 
whether or not these rankings 
have detrimental effects on universities.
The ranking and my parents interpreta
tions of them have suppressed my educa
tional interests and goals! said Tusher 
Dubey, a Junior Economics andPublicPolicy 
double major at CMU, in his letter to Nick 
Thompson, vice president of the ASSU, concerningthe recent coalition against the U.S 
News & World Report rankings of colleges.
AccordingtotheSanFranciscoChronicle, 
there is some speculation that Stanford 
students started this coalition because they 
were unhappy withthefactthatthey dropped 
from fourth to sixth in the rankings. How
ever Thompson said that they just want 
U.S. News to move away from [their] sum 
total rankings [because] they shouldnt say 
best/worst when referring to a university.
In addition to Stanfords involvement, 
many other top ranked schools have 
joined this coalition. Groups of students 
and in some cases faculty from Univer
sity of Michigan, Duke, and University 
of Chicago have joined FUNC to try to 
make their students and faculty, aware 
of what they believe is happening. 
Groups at Harvard, Yale, and CMU, 
among others, have upcoming votes
"College educations cannot and 
should not be quantified like 
household appliances,"
 a Stanford FUNC press release
about whether or not to join FUNC.
The main goal of FUNC is to get U.S. 
News and World Report [which they 
refer to as U.S. News and WorldDistort] 
to stop publishing their annual rankings 
of Americas Best Colleges, or at least to 
substantially change the way they do 
the issue, according to a press release 
from the Stanford FUNC coalition. 
FUNC proposes that if U.S. News does 
not stop publishing the issue, that they 
only list the colleges alphabetically and 
keep all the same categories except rank
ing, according to Nick Thompson.
Here at CMU, two students are taking 
it upon themselves to create student sup
port and increase awareness on campus, 
said Dubey, who is also working with
Terry Lumish, a senior social and decision 
science major. Dubey and Lumish have 
spoken with history professor Eric Langer, 
industrial management advisor Claudia 
Kirpatrick regarding FUNCs goals. 
Kirpatirick said she was fully in support 
of the movement and would like to take it 
further and extend the contention to busi
ness school rankings also, said Tubey. 
Weve [also] tried to contact President 
Mehrabian, [but] have not 
been able to get [in touch. 
with] him. Dubey and 
Lumish intend to bring up a 
bill at the Student Senate 
meeting this Monday in 
which they will request that 
CMU administration stop 
giving information to U.S. 
News that will be used in 
ranking, said Dubey. This is an effort 
that many other schools such as Stanford, 
Michigan, Reed College in Oregon, and 
Albian College in Michigan have also 
resorted to, according to the Stanford 
FUNC press release.
College educations cannot and should 
not be quantified like household appli
ances. Moreover, the rankings are arbi
trary, bordering on irresponsible, subjec
tive, and often misleading, but are taken as 
dogma by many prospective college appli
cants, employers, and parents, according 
to the Stanford FUNC press release.
Stanford has set up a Stanford Fund in 
order to increase alumni giving in the hopes

Czechs order more tests for Persian Gulf veterans
PRAGUE, Czech Republic Oct. 26 
(AP)  Czech officials have ordered 
that soldiers who served in the Per
sian Gulf War undergo another round 
of medical tests to search for the cause 
of continuing health problems.
About 40 of the more than 200 Czech 
soldiers who served in the 1991 Gulf 
War have reported health problems, 
accordingto Czech media. Complaints 
include headaches, joint pain, rashes, 
and fatigue  similar to problems 
reported by U.S. soldiers who served 
in the Gulf.
The Czech unit, deployed as part of 
the allied coalition, reported detecting 
traces of nerve gas and mustard gas. 
Czech veterans complain their gov
ernment never analyzed the reports 
and did not properly check the sol
diers health, the CTK state news 
agency reported Friday night.
Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir 
Suman said this week that all of the 
Czech soldiers would undergo new 
medical examinations. No information
will be released before the tests are 
completed next spring, he said.
Suman said the Czech soldiers had 
been invited to have medical check
ups when they returned from the Gulf, 
but that only 39 had accepted.
None ofthe check-ups showed, and 
I saw the papers, that their health 
problems would ... be caused by their 
stay in the Gulf, he said. Despite of 
that, all medical documentation will 
be gathered and ... they will be re
peatedly invited to undergo a com
plex examination. The soldiers 
health complaints are similar to prob
lems reported by U.S. soldiers who 
served in the Gulf.
Earlier in the month, the Pentagon 
said that more than 15,000 U.S. sol
diers may have been exposed to nerve 
gas. But the Defense Department has 
said that there is little scientific evi
dence suggesting that soldiers exposed 
to small amounts of chemical weap
ons would suffer long-term health 
problems.
Olympic bombing suspect is cleared of all charges
ATLANTA Oct. 26 (Reuter)  The 
U.S. Justice Department on Saturday 
publicly cleared Richard Jewell as a 
suspect in the FBI investigation into 
the Olympic Park bombing.
Nearly three months after the former 
security guard became the only named 
suspect in the federal probe into the 
deadly blast, the U.S. Attorneys Of
fice in Atlanta issued a letter to Jewells 
legal team saying he was no longer 
being targeted by investigators.
Barring any newly discovered evi
dence, this status will not change, the 
letter continued.
Neither Je well nor his attorn eys were 
immediately available for comment.
The attack occurred in downtown 
Atlanta during a free Olympic concert 
when a pipe bomb hidden in a green 
knapsack exploded, leaving two dead 
and more than 100 wounded.
Jewell, a 33-year-old former police 
officer, was initially hailed as a hero 
for finding the knapsack and helping 
police to clear the area before the 
device detonated. But three days later, 
another newspaper report named him 
as a suspect in the investigation. Thus 
began weeks of searches, FBI surveil
lance, and round-the-clock scrutiny 
by the news media.
Jewell was never charged with a crime 
and has maintained his innocence.
Canadian Parliament bill lays claim to lands in U.S.
OTTAWA, Oct. 24  Land in down
town Philadelphia could be claimed by 
descendants of the British loyalists 
who owned it before the Revolution
ary War under a bill being considered 
in the Canadian Parliament.
The measure that would allow the 
descendants to claim lands in the 
U.S. confiscated from their ancestors 
during the war is a tit-for-tat response 
to a U.S. law giving U.S. citizens the 
same right regarding property confis
cated in Cuba after Fidel Castros 
revolution.
The Treaty of Paris of 1783 that 
ended the American Revolution pro
vided for restitution for all confiscated 
lands, but the U.S. never followed 
through on the condition.
Claims have been filed in Canada 
for land in downtown areas in the 
following areas: Philadelphia, Boston, 
Manhattan, North Carolina, Virginia, 
and Washington, D.C.
Shelling in Zaire starts stampede
GOMA, Zaire, Oct. 27 (CNN)  At 
least four people were killed and hun
dreds of others wounded after a Rwandan 
Hutu refugee camp in eastern Zaire was 
ambushed Friday, setting off a stam
pede of more than 200,000 people.
Fleeing refugees said shells landing 
inside Kibumbacamp, near the Rwandan 
border, triggered the massive exodus. 
The camp hospital was burned and shells 
exploded along their escape route south 
to Goma, they added.
It was not immediately clear who 
launched the assault.
It's tragic, appalling. We have a hu
man river 25 kilometers (15 miles) long 
from the camp south to Goma, said Panos 
Moumtzis, spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
About 5,000 refugees were streaming 
into Goma per hour, he said. They were 
being directed to Mugunga camp, which 
already houses some 220,000 refugees.
The refugee crisis is just getting worse 
and worse without any solution, 
Moumtzis said. Meanwhile, at the 
nearby Zairian provincial capital of 
Bukavu, heavy artillery rained down 
and small arms fire was heard as ethnic 
Tutsi rebels known as Banyamulenge 
appeared to be closing in.
Over 50 refugees and soldiers from the 
camp and civilians from a village were 
treated at the Goma hospital. UNHCR 
officers reported seeing four bodies, but 
added that those in flight said dozens, 
possibly hundreds, were killed.
The incidents are part of the spreading 
war in central Africa fueled by a power 
struggle between Hutus and Tutsis.
More than a million Rwandan Hutu 
refugees have lived in a string of camps 
in eastern Zaire since 1994. They fled to 
the region following the 1994 genocide 
in which Hutus killed at least 500,000 
people, mostly Tutsis.
The Hutus have refused to return, 
fearingreprisals from the Tutsi-led army 
for the massacre. Hutu extremists have 
been using refugee camps in Zaire as 
bases for cross-border raids into Rwanda.
About a half million of the refugees 
are on the move as fighting between 
Tutsi rebels and Zairian troops has esca
lated in recent weeks.
Zaire has accused both Rwanda and 
nearby Burundi of aiding the ethnic Tutsi 
fighters in eastern Zaire, a charge both 
countries deny.
In-laws burn bride over small dowry
NEW DELHI, Oct. 25 (UPI) A court 
in Indias northern Haryana state 
handed down life sentences Friday to 
four members of a family who set fire to 
a young woman in a dispute over dowry, 
a report said. Suman, a housewife in 
the town of Sonepat, was doused with 
kerosene and set ablaze by her male in
laws in June 1994, the Press Trust of 
India reported.
The prosecution described how 
Sumans shrieks caused neighbors to 
rush to her aid following the incident. 
Moments before dying in a nearby hos
pital, she fingered her in-laws for the 
crime, the news agency said.
Besides the life sentences, the judge in 
the case fined each of the four men the 
equivalent of $ 140, which is to be paid to 
Sumans surviving son, the report said.
Indian custom stipulates that a 
brides family should pay the grooms 
relatives money and gifts as a precon
dition of the marriage.
However, in recent years the de
mands for dowry have grown exponen
tially. When the excessive demands 
are not met, the grooms in-laws some
times resort to so-called bride burn
ing, as a way to secure the man a more 
lucrative marriage.
Mexican president talks to witches
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 25 (UPI)  A 
Mexican clairvoyant involved in a highlevel government investigation said Fri
day that former president Carlos Sali
nas de Gortari consulted with witches 
during his administration.
Clairvoyant Francisca Zetina, who has 
been credited with tipping off authori
ties about buried human remains at the 
Mexico City home of Salinass impris
oned brother, made the comments in an 
interview on Mexico Citys Radio Red.
Zetina said Carlos Salinas consulted 
the witches, known in Mexico as 
shamanes or brujos, in an attempt to 
predict the future. He [Salinas] has his 
own shamanes... and he still has them, 
Zetina said.
Zetina, known as La Paca, has been in 
the headlines in recent weeks after a let
ter she sent to the Attorney Generals 
Office led to the unearthing ofthe remains 
that authorities say could be those of miss
ing politician Manuel Munoz Rocha.
Authorities continue to study the skel
etal remains to determine if they belong 
to Munoz Rocha, whom Raul Salinas 
allegedly contracted to mastermind the 
murder of ruling party secretary-gen
eral Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu in Sep
tember 1994. Raul Salinas consulted 
regularly with Zetina, who said she 
warned him of his impending February
1995 arrest six months before it occurred.
He wasnt scared. He felt sure of 
himself because he thought money could 
take care of everything ... connections 
and power at times make people crazy, 
Zetina said.
Carlos Salinas, who left office in De
cember 1994, is currently living in Ire
land. However, he has not been formally 
linked to any of his brothers alleged 
crimes.
Foreign Minister Angel Gurria said 
Friday that Carlos Salinas may be called 
to testify at a Mexican consulate abroad 
concerning another 1994 political assas
sination, that of ruling party presiden
tial candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.
Political protester immolates self
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 23A woman 
known at the University of Pennsylva
nia as Kathy Change for her protest 
activities has committed suicide by set
ting herself on fire.
46-year-old Kathleen Chang yester
day doused herself with gasoline and set 
herself ablaze in front of the schools 
main library. Chang was a familiar sight 
on campus with her one-woman demon
strations for world peace and other 
causes. A note' she left behind said her 
failure to win followers was the reason 
for the self-immolation.Emergency called for in Florida city
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. Oct. 25 
(Reuter)The mayor of St. Petersburg 
declared a state of emergency Friday 
after a night of rioting that rocked the 
city following a police shooting.
There is reason to believe that a clear 
and present danger exists of a riot or 
other general public disorder, wide
spread disobedience, said a declaration 
issued by Mayor David Fischer and the 
police department. National Guard units 
were on stand-by but no curfew was 
declared, officials said.
Police chief Darrell Stephens told a 
news conference, This has been a calm 
day in St. Petersburg after the destruc
tion of last night. Schools and businesses 
opened, closed and operated without 
incident. Even with a days calm, Im 
exercising certain executive actions to 
maximize the opportunity for a safe and 
orderly weekend by issuing certain emer
gency actions, he said. The emergency 
order banned the sale and display of 
firearms and ammunition and banned 
carrying firearms in public. It also pro
hibited the sale of gasoline except when 
put directly into a vehicle.
The state of emergency and emer
gency actions will be in effect for 72 
hours, beginning at 4:40 pm EDT on 
Friday, police said. Some 200 National 
-Guardsmen were on standby at a city 
athletic stadium.

50 YEARS AGO, Nov. 26, 
1946: By popular vote, Vaughn 
Monroe was selected as the fea
ture performer for the Spring 
Carnival, which would be held 
the following May. As a result of 
a school wide election, Monroe 
placed first by a landslide as the 
band that Tech preferred to 
dance to at the schools annual 
three-day celebration.
The carnival band committee 
contacted agencies immediately, 
but it was not expected to know 
until February if the band would 
definitely be available for the 
date. Voter turnout was not as 
heavy as expected, but many 
Monroe fans showed up. The bud
get for the dance was $3,500.
25 YEARS AGO, Nov. 4,1971: 
CMU President H. Guyford 
Stever was rumored to be nomi
nated as the next Director of the 
 $600 million National Science 
Foundation (NSF).
A Washington D.C. newsletter 
and The Boston Globe ran ar
ticles stating that Stever would 
be nominated by PresidentNixon.
Stever denied rumors of his 
nomination and impending res
ignation, saying, One doesnttalk 
about such a nomination until 
one gets one.
Although many thought Nixon 
would nominate Stever in 1969, 
he instead nominated conserva
tive Frank Long of Cornell to the 
NSF Directorship, only to with
draw the offer later. A furor in 
the scientific community forced 
Nixon to re-nominate Long, who 
subsequently rejected the nomi
nation.
TEN YEARS AGO, Nov. 4, 
1986: In further protest of South 
Africas apartheid policies, Stu
dents Against Apartheid (SAA) 
constructed a shanty on the Cut 
by the flagpole. The group 
planned to stay in the make shift 
building, dubbed Biko Hall, 
through November 11, when the 
Board of Trustees would meet to 
discuss divestment.
An officer approached the 
structure after professors who 
had seen the construction had 
reported it to security. The of
ficer contacted the dean of Stu
dent Affairs, who declared that 
it was okay for the students to be 
there.
The next day, the assistant 
dean of Student Affairs told the 
students they had to leave due to 
a policy established by then Presi
dent Cyert against the construc
tion of shanties on campus by 
students. The administration did 
not approve of SAAs tactics.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Oct. 28, 
1991: A research programmer 
presented a document at a press 
conference which alleged that 
CMU scientists were engaged in 
the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA).
The document focused on ways 
that university research could be 
directly helpful to the military. 
This research included: bomb 
damage assessment, fully auto
mated bombing, unmanned 
guided vehicles, automatic track
ing and weapons control, and 
autonomous helicopters.
Accordingto the researcher, the 
research projects would make 
weapons more deadly, make au
tomated war more acceptable to 
the U.S., and that CMU does not 
engage in general research, but 
is instead a direct research branch 
of the Pentagon.
Researchers who were named 
in the document denied the 
claims, but after analyzing the 
document, three CMU professors 
supported it.
ONE YEAR AGO, Oct. 30, 
1995: Although half of Student 
Senates 38 seats were up for 
grabs, only three candidates ap
peared on the ballot. The low 
number of applicants was a re
sult of what the Senate Chair 
called a group effort of mistakes.
Each semester, half the seats 
in Senate come up for re-election. 
To qualify for a seat, students 
must be enrolled and have paid 
their Activities Fee. To get on the 
ballot, candidates are required 
by Senate by-laws to submit a 
petition signed by 25 students 
from their college. Petitions are 
due two weeks prior to the first 
day of elections.
Before the deadline Senate typi
cally runs a petition ad in The 
Tartan, however the newspaper 
didnt publish that week due to 
mid-semester break.

Network 2000 enhances campus
0densma2 gr. STt8 -
Napjus gave several ex
amples of how N etwork 2000 is 
already being used for research 
and for learning in the class
room. Researchers in the Cen
ter for the Neural Basis of Cog
nition are using Network 2000 
to tie their researchers to
gether.... A professor in the 
College of Fine Arts is teach
ing a class called Virtual 
Worlds which will allow stu
dents and others to explore vir
tual reality over Network 
2000.
He added that Computing 
Services expects the availabil
ity of high speed networking 
to spur new projects that take 
advantage of the technology.
One of the current constraints 
is funding. The upgrade cost 
for academic buildings was 
originally estimated at $2.3 
million. However, through dis
counts, the University was able 
to lower that amount to around 
$1.3 million.
Of that total, $700,000 has 
been secured so far. It is esti
mated that costs for replace
ment of the computing software 
the dorms would run from
$1-2 million.
The University is empolying 
several means to fund the 
Network 2000 project. Car
negie Mellon has developed a 
relationship with Cisco Sys
tems over the years, which 
has helped in implementing 
this initiative.
Weve been using Cisco equip
ment at the core of our network 
since 1988. In 1990, we entered 
into an agreement with Cisco to 
develop network monitoring 
software in exchange for our 
campus backbone routers (net
work switches.) Since then, we 
have been both a major user 
and an abuser of Cisco equip
ment throughout the core of our 
network.
In addition, the high speed 
network outlets will be avail
able in academic buildings for 
a fee of $325.00 for the switched 
10Mbps and $575.00 per outlet 
for the 100 Mbps shared ver
sion. However, even users who 
do not upgrade are expected to 
see a performance increase, ac
cording to a press release on 
Network 2000.
While deploying this sys
tem, Computing Services is
also investigating nascent 
technologies like Gigabit 
Ethernet and ATM for link
ing the various backbone 
routers, said Bartel.
Napjus also mentioned some 
of the other areas the Univer
sity is investigating for the fu
ture. [Computing Services is] 
working on additional features 
to the network such as native 
multicasting (MBONE) and 
quality of service controls for 
resource reservation. These fea
tures will utilize the Network 
2000 infrastructure weve put 
in place to help support new 
multimedia tools [that have] 
started to appear [like] video 
conferencing.
While different universities 
are looking at other network
ing options to meet the in
creasing demand for their 
campus network and Internet 
applications,
Bartel believes that Car
negie Mellon is one of the lead
ers in implementing next gen
eration networks. We have 
presented our plans to our 
peers and several [of them] 
are looking to incorporate ap
proaches similar to ours.
CMU students victimized by 
alleged telemarketing scam
By PRATISH RAO HALADY
Tartan Junior Staff writer
In the last week, several CMU students 
have been victims of an alleged telephone 
scam. Many students have complained to the 
police about receiving telephone solicitations 
in their residence rooms. The solicitors, who 
call themselves the American Marketing 
Group, asked students to subscribe to several 
popular magazines. Seven magazines were 
named, including U.S. News and World Re
port and Sports Illustrated.
According to a crime alert from the campus 
police, the solicitors have represented that a 
subscription arrangement has been made 
through the University. This, however, is 
false, as the alert adds that the University 
has not authorized any business to solicit 
students by telephone.
The police crime alert requests for students to 
be suspicious of high pressure sales tactics, 
telephone solicitors who are seeking [the stu
dents] credit card numbers, and contracts that 
[students] agree to over the phone.
While several students are victims of phone 
solicitations, most have been suspicious of the 
subscriptions and have consequently refrained 
from agreeing to the contracts.
John Gunter, a freshman ECE major, received 
a call from the American Marketing Group about 
a week ago.'The lady told me that theyd send me. 
seven magazines for free, and all I had to do was; 
send them three dollars when I got them, he; 
said.
William Kaiser, who is currently investigating; 
the case, states that the magazine scam is an 
issue which is still being investigated. Therefore; 
it is not an issue upon which [Kaiser] can com; 
ment. Kaiser did say, however, that if a student; 
receives a product he or she did not order or agree; 
to receive, he or she must make it clear to the; 
company that the product is not wanted.
When dealingwith a company under the above 
conditions, the student should obtain the name. 
of the company, the full name of the person to 
which they are speaking, and the address and. 
phone number of the company, he said.
According to the crime alert, students are 
also advised not to give information about 
[their] credit cards over the phone unless 
[they] have identified the contact or agree to. 
any contract unless [they] know all of the 
details, conditions, and terms.
However, at this point because the police in
vestigations are still going on, campus police 
cannot make any conclusions or comments about 
the case.
FUNC disputes annual college rankings
oR0l2 omsN 9EFd -
also changed the grading system to be 
more strict in ord er to try and aid rankings, 
according to Thompson.
Dubey said that he has lived the last two 
years of [his] life by this ranking and that 
because of this ranking his choices of col
leges and universities have been unduly 
influenced. What makes these rankings 
even more detrimental is that there is great
suspicion that many universities inflate their 
statistics to improve their standing, accord
ing to an article in The Wall Street Journal.
It is precisely the power of the guide 
to affect the decisions of students, par
ents, and administrators that makes its 
unique rating system so deleterious, 
according to the Stanford Daily Online.
In response to the U.S. News rankings, 
Reed College has decided to stop sending
any information to U.S. News until they 
reform their current system of ranking. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, If 
students want to go to a school that isnt 
interested in selling out its education, 
they should go to Reed College in Oregon
 the only school in the country that 
refuses to provide information to U.S. 
News, and, as they have put it, to behave 
as if they are hostage to the rankings.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief

amount of stuff outside of here, said 
Joseph. Especially on the West Coast 
Iin] Silicon Valley. Thats where ev
erybody wants to end up. There are 
good opportunities for internships, or 
something short-term [in Pittsburgh], 
but Silicon Valleys still where its at, 
he said.
Manu Kumar, a master of software 
engineering in the Computer Science 
Department said he came to the 
@pgh. cafe to see whats already in Pitts
burgh [and] whether or not its feasible 
to stay here. In general it [the @pgh.cafe] 
is better than the job fair last year, he 
said. I think most students came here 
with the mentality that theyre not go
ing to stay in Pittsburgh, but theyre 
going to check it out anyway, and its 
only CMU that makes me want to stay. 
The city is not relevant; the only thing 
Im looking for is people.

10/19 TRAFFIC INCIDENT, 3:23 
am. The driver of a CMU shuttle van 
'stated that while attempting to go 
around a slower-moving car on Beacon 
Street, the driver of another vehicle 
turned in front of the van, causing the 
vehicles to collide. The front and rear 
doors were damaged, as well as the 
mirror of the car.
As both vehicles were going down 
Beacon towards Wightman, the van 
attempted to go around the car to 
enter the left turn only lane. When 
the car tried to get into the same lane, 
the accident occurred. None of the 
passengers in either vehicle sustained 
injuries.
10/19 FIRE ALARM, 10:38 pm. 
CMU police responded to a Hunt Li
brary alarm indicating the basement 
elevator room smoke detector had acti
vated. All units responded.
A strong smell of smoke was found 
in the elevator shaft, but it could not 
be determined where it was coming 
from. Lins Elevator was notified, and 
FMS was notified due to a large 
amount of water in the elevator room. 
City fire units also responded and 
turned the main power to the eleva
tor off.
The system was silenced but not reset 
until this work was done. FMS said that 
'they would reset the system.
President lauds University in speech
EARN062 gr. STt8 -
dont need any new buildings.... We want to 
keep the same size and focus on quality. 
Before Mehrabians speech, Lucian 
iCaste, president of the Andrew Car
negie Society (ACS), spoke about the 
groups fund-raising efforts. ACS has 
;ed more than a hundred million dol
lars over the years, said Caste.
The speech also focused on the Uni
versity Center. A short film highlight
ing it was shown between the speeches. 
Its several orders of magnitude bet
ter than the old Skibo. When I was [here, 
Skibo] was useful for a cafeteria and 
thats about it. We really needed some
thing like this, and Im glad you have it, 
said Lederman.
The speech was followed by the dedi
cation of a plaque containing the names 
of ACS people who donated to the project. 
At noon there was a champagne toast 
where the attending alumni received 
commemorative flutes.
I think that the biggest job of a presi
dent is to get graduates to contribute to
the University and he did a wonderful 
job, and Fm sorry to see him leave, said 
Meyers.
The speech gave Mehrabian, who an
nounced his resignation last year, an 
opportunity to say good-bye to the alumni 
and the University.
Being president of a university like 
Carnegie Mellon is a humbling experi
ence, but full of vitality. It is an experi
ence that is second to none. I think Id 
rather be president of CMU than any
where else in the world, said Mehrabian.
Crime and Incident Report
10/20 MEDICAL, 1:17 am. EMS 
personnel and an officer were dis
patched to Donner Hall for a medical 
call.
Upon arrival, the patient stated 
that while closing the door to a room, 
someone else pushed the door shut, 
causing the patients finger to be 
pinched between the door and the 
jamb.
The patient had the finger covered 
with a white cloth, and it was bleed
ing. EMS bandaged the injury and the 
officer provided transportation to 
Presbyterian Hospital. Central Prop
erty Services cleaned up the blood.
10/23 MEDICAL, 5:56 pm. An of
ficer transported a CMU football 
player to Presbyterian Hospital. The 
students nose was bleeding and pos
sibly broken.
Two football team trainers were

elbowed in the face by another 
player.
10/13 PERSONAL INJURY, 3:17 
pm. An officer transported an ani
mal technician to Shadyside hospi
tal for treatment.
The technician was cleaning the 
ceiling with detergent in the mice 
lab when the injury occured.
The detergent, called Quadra Suds, 
dripped into the technicians eye. The 
eye was irrigated for 15 minutes before 
the supervisor insisted that the victim 
go to the hospital.
10/23 THEFT, 8:37 pm. An officer 
received a theft report over the phone 
from a graduate of CMU. The graduate 
said that during this past springs 
graduation ceremonies, a Gucci watch 
valued at $1,200 was stolen.
The graduate said that the reason no

Publication date set 
for Student Union
By JENNY GARCIA de OSUNA
Assistant Forum Editor
For almost two years now, The Stu
dent Union, a student-run publica
tion, has not come out with a steady 
flow of publications. As there were 
only four issues published last year 
and none yet this semester, one may 
wonder what is going on.
I remember reading The Student 
Union when I got to this school as a 
freshman, said Brandy Humphrey, 
senior English major. The next year 
it stopped coming out, and I went to go 
see why. I began going to the meetings 
and we are trying hard to bring it back 
to the students.
To begin with, the organization has 
a very small crew this year. Only three 
students who had worked on the pub
lication in previous years came back 
this semester to work on it again.
The three of them have had to share 
all of the administrative responsibili
ties that came with the new Univer
sity Center.
On top of having a small staff, the 
group has had other problems which 
hindered a speedy come-back this se
mester. They had to give up comput
ers, printers, and a scanner due to lack 
of space in their new office at the 
University Center.
Throughout this semester, they have 
been trying to sign a contract with a 
printer, set up the new room, and
come up with an interesting way to re
introduce the publication.
We have had a problem getting a 
contract signed with a printer because 
our publication is controversial, said 
Humphrey. If we write, for example, 
about rape, we dont hold back any
thing. There is usually also obscenity 
in our articles.
They did, however, finally get a con
tract with Gazette Printers, the same 
printers who publish In Pittsburgh.
We should have an issue in about 
one and a half weeks, said Justin 
Bigos, senior history major. For now, 
it has just been a huge lack of organi
zation and interest.
The first issue this semester, slated 
to come out November 3rd, is a special 
on the elections.
From then on, they hope to pro
duce two publications a month: a 
small four-page publication at the 
start of the month and a regular 
eightto twelve-page paper by the 
end of each month.
For now, we have only spent 
money on flyers and getting the of
fice organized, said Humphrey. We 
used the money left over from last 
year to buy software to make our 
publication on-line.
The on-line version of The Stu
dent Union will be produced by a 
graduate student during the winter 
break and will not be out until next 
semester.
Corrections/Clarifications...
In last weeks issue, it was mentioned that the cast of Happy Days at the 
City Theatre from November 6-24 was comprised of CMU students. It is 
actually made up of CMU professors.
The Tartan corrects all known errors of fact If you know of such an error, 
please contact Tartan Editor-in-Chief Kenneth J. Kraemer at 268-2111.

get you an absentee ballot appli
cation for your state, and they 
will be more than willing to send 
it to you.
This is an election year, and 
the deadline to vote is fast ap
proaching. If you are not voting 
(and are of legal age to vote), you 
are ignoring an important and 
unique opportunity and commit
ting a great disservice. The stu
dent turn-out to national elec
tions has been low in the past 
few years, and one of the reasons 
for this is rooted in the idea that 
students are traditionally unin
formed.
Please, dont be traditional.
Consider this  every student 
here, from freshman to fifth-year 
senior to graduate to post-doc
toral student, will be effected by 
the new presidents policies. The 
future of student aid will be decidedin the next four years. Taxes 
will be set, and laws will be 
passed that will affect you and 
the job market. Decisions con
cerning topics extremely perti
nent to many college students, 
such as abortion, ecology, smok
ing, and foreign policy, will be 
legislated.
A new party could come into 
office, and this alone will have a 
far-reaching effect on every stu
dent here.
To become well informed about 
the issues is not difficult. Politi
cal parties all have web-sites
where copies of their respective 
platforms are available. 
Newsweek, Time and many other 
news magazines are preparing 
for a frenzied few weeks before 
the winners are officially an
nounced. The Pittsburgh PostGazette is publishing interviews 
featuring everyday people dis
cussing their candid opinions.
There is no excuse for igno
rance, and ignorance is not an 
excuse not to vote.
Some students say they have 
not yet formed strong opinions. 
However, it does not take strong 
opinions to make a choice be
tween to relatively polar candi
dates. Some students may say 
they dont like politics. Well, the 
twisted skein of promotion and 
dealing will unravel when it 
comes down to your choice. You 
are not voting against the scan
dals the media regularly throws 
on the national screen. You are 
voting for one person who will 
take part in many important 
decisions for the next four years.
In addition, the election will 
feature a parade of local issues 
that require your voice. Senato
rial and House seats will be de
cided upon, as well as local legis
lators. Decisions must he made 
and will be made. If you are not 
part of this process, you are, in 
effect, accepting ignorance.
Call your parents. Get your 
ballot and send it in. Theres an 
election comingup, and you need 
to be a part of it.
IT needs efficiency, 
improved operations
Carnegie Mellon is a university 
known for its provisions and ap
plications of advanced technology 
in every facet of life. It has re
vered programs in Computer Sci
ence, ECE, and other high-tech
nology areas. Email has, in many 
cases, surpassed the telephone as 
the primary communication 
method, and some of our Web sites 
have received national acclaim. 
So why is it so difficult to get a 
Macintosh on-time and in work
ing order for a class lecture?
In other words, Instructional 
Technology (IT) does not nearly 
live up to the standards and needs 
of this University.
Located in Building D, IT is out 
of the way of the mainstream; it is 
inconvenient for students to get 
there, and inconvenient for equip
ment to get anywhere else.
Equipment going from IT to a 
classroom has to first be ferried 
into Wean, up the (excruciatingly 
slow) elevator, and out to campus. 
This is not an efficient method of 
delivering technology to the class
room. Since it is such a process to 
make equipment available, often 
it is very late and arrives after 
class has started.
Equipment resident in the class
rooms is often inoperational. 
When equipment doesnt work 
properly, IT will eagerly send 
someone to help, but it usually 
takes too long for a technician to 
arrive, and by the time they do, 
the class has usually proceeded 
already and their efforts are fu
tile.
Presentations for classes are of

students. It is important for stu
dents to perform in an organized 
fashion, and equally important 
for them to be calm, cool, and 
collected. This can be very diffi
cult if they do not have the equip
ment they need to present prop
erly, or if the equipment is inad
equate or not functioning prop
erly. The impact of a presentation 
is lessened considerably if a stu
dent has to stop several times to 
fix the slide proj ector or reboot the 
Macintosh.
Moving to a location closer to 
the center of campus might help 
to get equipment to classes on 
time. If new, central facilities are 
not a possibility, then perhaps a 
closet or storage room in each 
building on campus should be set 
aside for equipment. As such, a 
technician would need only trans
port equipment down the hall, 
as opposed to out of the ravine and 
across campus. In addition, if a 
wire or piece of equipment is miss
ing, or the equipment is not func
tional, it could be replaced far 
more quickly. In addition, admin
istrators and departments in each 
building should understand the 
importance of ITs services and be 
flexible in reaching a space solu
tion in their buildings.
The high-technology that CMU 
is famous for is state-of-the-art 
computers, networks, software, 
and robotics. The students and 
faculty at CMU should at least be 
able to benefit from having access 
to functional, reliable basic tech
nology; and Instructional Tech
nology must improve to provide 
that benefit.
Editor:
We were dismayed 
that the Tartans edi
torial board sought to 
condemn Gay Jeans 
Day. The authors 
were correct in their 
deduction that cmuOUT must be hop
ing to get as many people as possible 
thinking. Indeed, being challenged to 
think about an issue, formulate an opin
ion, and share that opinion with others 
is an important part of university life. 
What kind of university would this be if 
people only thought of themselves and 
never shared their ideas? Being part of 
a university community means taking 
part in a dialogue, whether or not we 
are comfortable with the topic. cmuOUT 
is consciously challenging people to 
make a choice to wear jeans, because 
society continually forces queer people 
to make a choice. We can either reveal 
our true selves and face consequences 
including losing our jobs or getting 
beaten up, or we can live in the closet, 
safe from direct harm but knowing that 
our life is a lie and ever fearing that our 
clothing, hair, gestures, or speech might 
give us away. For one day,*we are ask
ing others on campus to get into our 
shoes and consider the routine choices 
we are forced to make. If that makes 
this community uncomfortable, then we 
mean to make you uncomfortable.
cmuOUT wants everyone to know 
Wednesday October 30 is Gay Jeans 
Day; there is nothing underhanded 
about it. cmuOUT is taking every mea
sure we could think of to get the word 
out: fliers, letters to RAs, administra
tors, and student organizations, ban
ners above Doherty and in other places, 
fence painting, table tents, press re
leases, posts on appropriate bboards, 
and a table on the Cut October 29 and 30 
to distribute information and denim rib
bons for people who would rather ex
press their support that way. Support
means different things to different 
people. Some people may wear jeans 
because they care for friends, cowork
ers, or family members who are gay, 
lesbian, or bi. Some may wear jeans 
because they think it is wrong for people 
to be harassed or discriminated against 
because they are (or are perceived to be) 
lesbian, gay, or bi.
Some may wear jeans because they 
want their closeted friends to feel com
fortable enough to come out to them. 
Finally, gay, lesbian, and bisexual people 
may wear jeans because they are proud 
to be who they are. Its not about support 
for a lifestyle but support for actual 
people who are part of our community. It 
is cmuOUTs hope that the community 
will see Gay Jeans Day as nothing more 
and nothing less than an opportunity to 
demonstrate that Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity is a supportive place for gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual people.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
By striking at the 
straw man of Islamic 
fundamentalism in 
Afghanistan (Media 
manipulates images 
of women in other countries, 10/21), 
Elizabeth Irvines attempt to highlight 
her concerns about the plight of Ameri
can women falls into precisely the kind 
of deceptive manipulation of womens 
images which she accuses the media of.
According to her the media here is 
saying be content,things are good here, 
just look at those poor Afghani[s]. The 
flip side of this sort of reasoning is her 
argument saying dont vote conserva
tive, just look at those poor Afghanis to 
see where theyd lead us. Both are 
scare tactics with little analytical con
tent and can easily be passed over.
I do take issue with the deeper selfdeception, whether Irvines or the New 
York Times, and which is pervasive in 
this society about Muslim women.
Far from reducing women to sexual 
objects, Islamic dress codes for women, 
and men do exactly the opposite by re
moving sexuality from the public arena. 
If anything, the commercialization of 
womens images and the peer pressure 
to display womanly charm, or manly 
strength, or anything else materialistic, 
is what makes people objects.
Islam charges both men and women 
with duties, not all of which overlap. For 
example, a husband is financially en
tirely responsible for his family even if 
the wife has her own income. If, as in 
wartime, there are many widows, men 
who are able to do so support them by 
marrying again. Women keep their 
names after marriage.
The first person to accept Islam was a 
woman, as was the first martyr. All 
schools of Islamic law are based on source 
material relayed by early Muslim 
women.
Muhammad, peace be upon him, said 
that paradise lies at the feet of mothers 
and that the best of men in character are 
those who are best to their wives.
It is true that many nominal Muslims 
fall short of these Islamic standards, but 
standards they are. The traditional Af
ghan tribal face veil appears excessive. 
Contrast this to say Malaysia, where 
women still pray and wear the Islamic 
hijab (loose clothing and a head scarf) 
but also run high-tech companies: Still, 
in having brought peace to a place previ
ously at war, in reinstituting public or
der and in disarming militias and re
starting local consultative assemblies, 
the Taliban are doing something no one 
else did: they are keeping their word.

tee ballot-yesterday.
For a long time, I was 
debating whether or 
not to vote at all. Not" 
that I think it isnt 
possible for one man 
to make a difference.
The reason I wasnt 
going to vote was 
that there wasnt 
anybody I wanted to
vote for. I was kiddingly going to vote for Ralph Nader, but 
with my luck, everyone in the country will enter the voting 
booths in a few weeks, drunk as a skunk, and say, Ha Ha, 
lets vote for Nader. Thatd be funny. At least hell get one 
vote. Burp! Then, the next morning, wham! He won? Oh 
my God! I voted for Ralph Nader and he won. Whoops!
There was a huge debate raging inside me. On one hand,
I feel I should participate in the freedom that I have living 
the greatest democracy in the world. On the other hand, 
why bother voting for one of two buffoons who I wouldnt 
trust to run my dishwasher, let alone my country? Alas, I 
caved, but with style. Hopefully!?! I wrote in my dad for 
president. I dont know whether or not my dad would 
actually make a good president, but since I didnt get him
a birthday present this year, I thought it might be kind of 
flattering. And who knows, maybe there will be a move
ment of write-ins where my dad does win. I can confidently 
say hed be better than the two big-wigs running now. And 
if he did win, how cool would it be to go home for Thanks
giving in the White House? Great way to pick up women. 
Wanna come home and meet my dad? We can do it in the 
Lincoln Bedroom, if you fancy.
Recently, my household got cable. I was tentative, but my 
roommate twisted my arm. Literally, actually, and it hurt. 
So obviously, I said, uncle, and gave in. I knew that if we
--------------------------------------------- did get cable it would be a
tremendous temptation for 
me to drop out of school 
and watch reruns of 
Hogans Heroes all day. 
Weve had it for a few 
weeks now, and so far Ive 
been pretty good.
But the other day, after 
returning from my 
brothers wedding and 
New York after mid-se
mester break, I was sick and tired. Not of anything, but 
really quite sick and tired. So I vegged in front of Satans 
delightful toy.
Of the numerous and plentiful pieces of crap I watched, 
I will mention but a few to attempt to describe why politics 
sucks and further discuss, in part three of What the hell 
are we doing to ourselves?
VH-1. The special  What is American Style? First off, 
style, though possibly a tiny fraction, is not based on the 
clothes you wear. Secondly, if youre going to get anyones 
opinion on style, the last person you should be asking is 
Sharon Stone. Thirdly, does it really matter what makes 
American style, as opposed to European or African?

High school homecoming contrasts with college life
Rebecca Fribush
All of you, Im sure, have indel
ibly rosy memories of your high 
school Homecoming. I seem to 
have spent all four of mine sitting 
on sheet-metal bleachers ignor
ing those who scurried below me 
playing some game or other. Im 
not entirely certain on this one, 
but I suspect they might have 
been playing football. Something 
about the sound of battering hel
mets which kept interrupting my 
conversations must have clued 
me in.
The other big centerpieces of 
my high school Homecoming were 
the floats, the dance, and the
naming of the King and Queen. 
Before starting the game, wed 
all watch as two members of the 
in crowd were elevated to the 
nobility, the school apparently 
having worked up enough money 
to outfit them each with a small 
country somewhere in Central 
Europe over which to rule. Floats 
involved more members of the 
in crowd waving around on 
flatbed trucks to endless varia
tions on the theme We will rip 
into the other team, spear their 
most vital organs, and use them 
as monkey dissection samples in 
our biology labs, and if we dont 
do that,... well, they should just 
remember that we have cool 
people running around on flatbed 
trucks and they dont. 
Fascinating as this spectacle 
was, it couldnt compare, for sheer 
drama and excitement, with the
Homecoming dance. This glori
ous activity gave the students 
endless opportunities for fun, 
from the moment the gossip about 
whos taking whom commenced 
to the instant when the last 
would-be-dance-goer has found 
the perfect pair of shoes. The 
dance itself, Ive heard, was never 
all that exciting.
Homecoming at CMU is differ
ent from my high school experi
ence.
In high school we combed the 
county to find teams that were 
nearly as bad as we were. My 
sisters school once had to import 
a team from the next state so 
theyd have a shot at winning 
their Homecoming game. Here at 
CMU, were able to bring our cho
sen opposition all the way over 
from Illinois.
For another thing, CMU has no
king, no queen, and no floats. 
This place is much the better for 
it. CMU also presents an infi
nitely more sophisticated ap
proach to non-football-related 
Homecoming activities than did 
my high school. In other words, 
there are options other than a 
dance. Who knew that eating 
smores at a bonfire and watch
ing a stand-up comedian are per
fectly legitimate ways to show 
your Tartan spirit?
While I do miss the heady ex
citement of the days when whole 
conversations were made up of 
lovingly detailed descriptions of 
formal wear (...and have I men
tioned my stockings? I found a 
pair that are the exact same shade 
of black as my dress. You wouldnt 
believe how hard it was.), I think 
Ill have no trouble at all adapt
ing to life without them.
Other differences: CMU gives 
away free towels at the game. My 
high school didnt have money for 
such frillspaying for those two 
small Central'European nations 
put quite a dent in its budget. 
CMU is thronged with alumni 
young and old, from all corners of 
the globe, at Homecoming. If my 
high school were lucky, a few 
kids from the previous years class 
who went to local colleges might 
show up at its game.
Heres one last thing to con
sider. Whens the last time you 
heard of a high school that could 
get away with showing I Shot 
Andy Warhol during Homecom
ing festivities? My point precisely.
Becca Fribush is a freshman 
histoi'y major who will always 
hold a special place in her heart 
for her free Plaid Power towel.
Family Leave Act faces criticism
With a note 
of pessimism 
about the in
terest of CMU 
students in 
the news, I 
will assume 
that most of 
you out there havent seen the debates or watched 
much of the campaign. Well, to keep most of you 
up to date I would like to inform you that Clinton 
believes hes the pro-family candidate. I know 
Vits hard to believe, but Im not kidding. Clinton is 
.-basing this on the passing of the Family Medical 
Leave Act (FMLA) during his term and the fact 
that he wishes to expand it. Keep in mind that 
this is the same character, who in his State of the 
Union address this year, claimed that the era of 
big government was over, even while suggesting 
a whole bunch of new federal programs. The very 
notion that the FMLA is a good thing is specious. 
jrThis law is one of those governmental intrusions 
which not only doesnt help most people (it only 
affects large businesses, most of which already 
have such policies), but actually kills new job 
| creation by creating another disincentive to full
time employment. Think about it. If you were a 
company that was affected by it, you probably 
wouldnt like it. You have trained a person to 
work for you and have gone to a fair amount of 
trouble to ensure that he contributes to the pro
ductivity of the company. Then something bad 
happens to his family. The person has to leave. 
You are not allowed to replace him in any perma
nent sense. You have to take some underqualified 
temporary worker on, train them, and then once 
the original worker comes back you lose all the 
money and effort you spent on training the temp. 
You also have lost a good amount of productivity 
while the temp got up to speed. Unlike this 
scenario, vacations are a different issue and com
panies can plan for that gap in productivity. This 
scenario is a totally random occurrence and can
not be foreseen. If youre a business owner, whats 
your solution to this problem? Well, since this 
only applies to full-time workers, you hire more 
people part time or contract out the work to a 
 small agency which doesnt have as many encum
brances (like this law) due to their small size. 
This way, you avoid giving out full-time benefits, 
but can keep a long-term worker who can attain 
the needed level of training. You also dont face a 
major loss if any one of them leaves the company. 
You might also consider avoiding people with 
families as prospective employees.
Heck, if the person is single, you know youre 
pretty safe. Boy, thats good for families  a 
disincentive to hiring people with families. You 
' might have heard how Clinton has claimed that 
i there are 10 million new jobs under his reign. Yes,
there are, but many of these are with temp agen
cies and consulting firms (or burger flippers). 
These are not the stable jobs of yesteryear. These 
exist as long as there is a need and poof!, youre 
gone. You also dont get much in the way of 
benefits from these jobs. This is the ultimate 
result of government regulating employment: 
businesses will find ways around the rules. They 
have to if they wish to stay in business.
In the last debate Clinton attacked Dole on the 
basis that he opposed the FMLA. I think this is 
very much to Doles credit. It was especially to his 
credit since he. offered a much more sensible 
alternative. He supported a tax credit to employ
ers to allow employees to take leave in the case of 
a family emergency. Have you ever heard the 
phrase Youll catch more flies with honey than 
with vinegar? Well thats the logic behind Doles 
proposal. Clinton, in making this process of leave 
a case in which the employer is forced to do 
something and just suck up the cost, has made it 
something they will go to some lengths to avoid. 
Under the plan which Dole supported, the em
ployer would have had an incentive to be gener
ous to his employee. This would have not caused 
a wholesale change in the face of employment as 
most government regulations have, but instead it 
would have all the planned positive effects with
out any of the negative ones.
Democrats assume that anything they do, from 
regulations to tax cuts, will have a static result. 
They banned a bunch of guns based on appear
ance in the 1993 Omnibus Crime Act, and the 
manufacturers changed the appearance and sold 
functionally equivalent guns. They passed the 
FMLA and businesses changed the nature of 
their work force so this wouldnt affect them.
They instituted a luxury tax in 1990 on yachts 
and private jets, and both of these industries 
were crushed and no revenue gained. Then theres 
the assumption that if we cut taxes, well have a 
revenue loss. Thats bunk. When you cut taxes, 
especially capital gains taxes, you get a boom in 
economic activity which means that the money 
going into the tax coffers increases. Of course this 
is how Doles tax cut will actually pay for itself, 
Clintons charges notwithstanding. The funda
mental point here is that Bill Clinton and the 
Democrats think people cannot adapt to their 
circumstances. It is either that or the Democrats 
are too stupid to learn things themselves.
While I dont have the greatest faith in the 
average intellect out there, I will say that when it 
comes to economic self interest, people do manage 
to do the smart thing for themselves. This is why 
I still have a measure of faith that the public will 
realize where its self interest lies, and sends 
Clinton back to Arkansas.

Court TV. The Talk Show 
Killer. This segment was about 
the dude who was brought onto 
the Jenny Jones Show because 
someone had a crush on him. 
The catch was, the crush was a 
gay man and not the cute, but
ton-nosed blonde that the guest 
was expecting.
they were wasting valuable time 
and money to ask people which 
stinking email song was better. 
Talk about a waste of time.
Later on the show, their guests 
were George Segal and the bald 
dad from Morlz and Mindy.
Apparently, after doing a 
project together many years ago, 
they formed a ragtime, jazz band 
with Hal Linden. George played 
the banjo andMindys dad played 
the trombone. They were pro
moting some political thriller 
movie which they both had some
thing to do with, and played for 
the live studio audience. I will 
give credit where credit is due: 
they were pretty darn good, even 
if the clip of the movie wasnt. 
Mindys dad later told the hosts
If what it all comes down to in the 
end is what I'm wearing at the Sec
ond Coming, then Id much rather go 
to hell
Three days after the show, the 
guest received an anonymous 
love letter; which he obviously 
concluded was from the gay man, 
and not one of his redneck friends 
screwing with him.
He then proceeded to go over to 
the gay mans house to discuss 
the issue, and of course, he 
couldnt leave his house without 
his automatic rifle.
Needless to say, the gay man is 
dead and the guest is standing 
trial for murder.
Frankly, I dont think I need to 
comment on this, other than 
Duh. Finally, I ended up on 
some cheesy daytime talk show, 
probably on Lifetime or some
thing, where they requested 
people to call a 1-900 number to 
vote either on the new pop ver
sion or the original version of an 
email song the talk show wrote. 
Go ahead. Say What? Did you 
say email song?
Yes, you heard me correctly:
that they were playing the next 
night at Universal Studios as 
part of a presidential fund-raiser 
for Clinton. And well have a sax 
up there with us, just in case he 
wants to join us.
This irked me. I dont know 
why. It all seemed so fake and 
shallow. It was a bunch of, par
don my French, pussies pretend
ing that what were doing here 
on this planet was make-believe.
That if the first take didnt 
work, we could always go back 
and redo it, until it looked just 
right. We dont get many chances.
Too bad we do live in a real 
world with real problems and 
real consequences. But it was 
fun watching it all, Ill have to 
admit.

Hockey destroys NYU after falling to SRU attack, 4-2
HOCKEY, from page 12
out to score the first two goals of 
the period. Undaunted, CMU 
played valiantly, with Min an
choring the defense superbly. 
Down 2-1 in the last thirty sec
onds of the game, the Tartans 
made their last attempt to win. 
They pulled Min and sent all of 
their offense out on the ice. Whirl
ing in front of the oppositions 
net, CMU surprised Penn State 
West and Fitzgerald managed to 
stuff the puck in the back of the 
net, assisted by Buck and 
Adukaitis. The goal, right before 
the buzzer, was huge. CMU had 
driven and scored, and not al
lowed any more easy goals. The 
game ended in a 2-2 tie with Min 
adding ten saves in the third.
Kliegman said, I think 
Sundays game was great to watch 
a lot of the younger players step 
up and play a good game with 
most of the starters injured. [Jun
ior defenseman] Dave Mitzel did 
a solid job on defense. [Fresh
man] Brandon Paluzzi and P.J. 
[GryzwaczJ did a good job 
forechecking, and Gil made a lot 
of nice saves in goal.
He also said, Were still com
ing together as a team, but we 
looked much better Sunday then 
Saturday. Weve only had a 
handful of practices so far, and
I only see us improving in the 
next couple of weeks as every
one gets used to their 
linemates.
The team had two weeks to 
practice before meeting their 
next opponent, Slippery Rock. 
The two teams traditionally 
have been well matched, with 
SRU having the muscle and 
CMU having of the finesse. 
Last season CMU squeaked 
'iy SRU in both meetings. This 
/ear CMU was again on the 
jffensive, but not as effective 
as in the past and SRU took 
the game 4-2.
Slippery Rock capitalized on a 
very early Adukaitis tripping 
penalty to go up 1-0 on the power 
play. Although there were nine 
shots taken by CMU in the first 
period, only one managed to slip 
past SRU goaltender, Chris 
Wolfson. That shot, with four 
minutes left in the period, was 
scored by Fitzgerald, assisted by 
both junior forwardDerek Jander 
and Gryzwacz.
The celebration was short-lived, 
however, for although the Tartans 
continued to outshoot the opposi
tion 2:1, Slippery Rock scored the 
next three goals, two in the second 
period and one in the beginning of 
the third. Most of CMUs shots 
were going off of the net or right 
into the SRU goalies chest or glove, 
where he could easily handle the
play and stop any rebound at
tempts by CMU. Frustrated by 
the resurgence of SRUs traditional 
rough play in the second, CMU 
appeared unable to sufficiently 
defend themselves against the on
slaught. Although defensemen 
Blair Echols, Mitzel, and Voulgaris 
played excellently, they were un
able to shut down the SRU scoring 
line which had three of the teams 
four goals.
Towards the end of the period, 
when things started getting chippy 
again, SRU was called on a rough
ing minor with 1:32 left in the 
period, giving CMU the man ad
vantage for the rest of the game. 
Coach Maddalena called a quick 
time-out and called for the team to 
focus and dig hard for the remain
der of the period.
In a brilliant display of spirit, 
the power play line was out on 
the ice not twenty seconds before 
a Buck goal from Paul and 
Ivanovic.
This drive was the true mark of 
all that the team embodies, de
termination under pressure and 
ability to execute. Although the 
final score against SRU was a 4-
scoring his second goal of the sea
son in the first period on an excel
lent assist from Paul. The fast ice 
and sharp skating of the three 
strong forwards propelled them to 
lead in CMUs 16 shots on net in 
the first period.
Men were swarming the ice in 
the game. Third line defenseman 
fifth year Matt Williams and 
sophomore Alex Chin were 
brought up to play forward as 
well. The third line of freshmen 
Doreen Mulryan, Michael Baker 
and Austin Rodrick saw a fair 
amount of playing time and held 
firm on the ice. The rest of the 
period was fairly tame, no penal
ties and the defensive package of 
Mitzel, Tom Sullivan, Voulgaris 
and George Pavlic held the NYU 
offense to only seven shots. Start
ing goaltender Kliegman easily 
saved all seven shots.
During the break between periods, assistant coach/player 
Sullivan warned the team to stop 
playing with the puck. There had 
already been several missed 
breakaways on CMUs part. He 
encouraged the team to know right 
away what they were going to do

boards. The increased level of 
checking and dirty play on the 
part of NYU encouraged retalia
tion on the part of CMU. Players 
from both sides went into the box 
quickly after the first contact. Soon 
after, CMU scored again with 
Buck flipping the puck in, directed 
towards him by defenders Pavlic 
and Voulgaris and forward 
Adukaitis. A scuffle ensued in the 
following celebration between 
NYU players and the two 
defenseman.
Though NYU was hitting obvi
ously with intent to remove the 
defenseman scoring threat of 
Pavlic from the game, he instead 
was sent to the box with a mis
conduct and a double minor. The 
NYU antagonist was also sent to 
the box. The CMU penalty-kill
ing unit was tested a lot during 
the game, and came away clean 
each time, even coming up with 
the puck and managing to put it 
on net even with the man-down 
disadvantage. The team had 26 
penalty minutes total between 
four players. Their days of being 
out-muscled by the opposition 
appear to have ended.
After the second, the coach 
was very enthusiastic. This is 
the best that we have looked 
all season, he said, and the 
team heartily agreed.
They knew that they couldnt 
let up in the third as they only 
were up one goal. Coach encour
aged them not to head hunt for 
dirty players, just to play the 
game and continue the scoring 
drives. Last year, the team had 
been up going into the third and 
then let down and allowed three 
unanswered goals and lost to 
NYU in the end. He didnt want 
anyone to get tired this time. He 
pulled goalie Kliegman, who had 
nineteen saves, and replaced 
him with Min.
CMU dominated the third, far 
and away shutting down the of

puck and heads up defense from

bition play, the win was critical. It 
was their best game by far and 
displayed the teams strength in 
hitting and scoring.
Coach Maddalena, knowing that 
his offense needed to be bolstered, 
made several strategic changes in 
the line-up, position wise. First 
off, he bumped Adukaitis to for
ward on the first line, paired with 
Jim Buck and Anthony Paul. The 
three seniors played beautifully 
off of each other, with Adukaitis
with the puck when they got it 
because the second period was not 
going to be so easy. CMU was 
spoiling NYUs home opener of the 
season and NYU, last years divi
sional champions for their league, 
didnt want a poor showing in their 
own rink. They had started to shoot 
only towards the end of the period 
and now they were mad.
Sullivans words proved pro
phetic, as play was turned up in 
the second period. Aroused by 
Pavlics early rocket goal from be
hind the blue line that would have 
counted had it not been off sides, 
NYU showed that their heads were 
in the game by scoring five min

Meaningless honors awarded
From the Goal Line
by Ronak Singhal
Well, this past weekend was 
the halfway point of the NFL sea
son for the majority of teams, so 
its now time to have the presen
tation of the first and the only 
MATIMU awards. (MATIMU 
stands for Meaningles: 
Awards That I Made Up).
Most Improved 
Team: Runners-up 
are the Washington 
Redskins and the Hous
ton Oilers, but the first 
IVLATIMU goes to the Denver 
Broncos. John Elway has figured 
o.ut how to throw for 300 yards 
while also letting Terrell Davis 
get his 100 yards. This potent 
combination has been virtually 
unstoppable so far this season. 
Tihe defense is still a little sus
pect, but there arent many of
fenses that keep up with Denver. 
4nd if they get the home-field 
Advantage through the playoffs, 
^atch for them in the Super Bowl 
Hecause the weather tends to get 
a little nasty at Mile High.
| Least Improved Team: The 
runner-up is the New York Jets, 
b ut the clear winner of this award 
4re the Cincinnati Bengals. Last 
year, they pushed hard for a play
off spot behind the solid 
quarterbacking of Jeff Blake and 
tihe dynamic receiving trio of 
Darnay Scott, Tony McGee, and 
Carl Pickens. With Ki-jana Carter 
running the ball and a maturing 
defense led by Dan Wilkinson, 
expectations for this team were 
extremely high. Not anymore.
; Most Valuable Player: This 
a(ward usually goes to a player 
tyho is constantly in the lime
light. That characterization fits 
tjoth of our runners-up, but not 
tjhe winner. Second runner-up is 
John Elway who, as already men
tioned, is playing like he did when 
He had the Three Amigos. First 
runner-up is Brett Favre who 
began a spectacular assault of 
Dan Marinos record for number 
erf touchdowns in a season. But 
Favres favorite receiver, Robert 
I^rooks, is out for the year, so it 
rjemains to be seen how hell per
form the rest of the way. And the 
I^IVP is John Kasay of the Caro
lina Panthers. The Panthers reajlly dont have an explosive of
fense, but their defense keeps 
them close in most games. Kasay 
has made seven more field goals 
than any other kicker in the NFC, 
and that includes three from over 
50 yards. Hes one reason that the 
Panthers are challenging the 49ers 
f0r the crown in the NFC West.
; Best Running Back: Runqers-up are Terrell Davis and 
Jerome Bettis, but no one has 
tieen better than Ricky Watters 
thus far. Watters has become the 
workhorse for the Eagles now that 
odney Peete is gone and his run
ning attack has allowed Ty 
Detmer to get more comfortable 
ajs the Eagles quarterback. And 
its not only his rushing, but his 
receiving skills that have put 
Watters on top in the NFL.
Most Important Defensive 
Person for a Team that Wears 
Black and Gold and Plays 
Near Multiple Waterways: At 
the beginning of last season I 
would have said Rod Woodson, 
but he removed himself from 
the competition when he missed 
the entire regular season and 
the Steelers still made the Su
per Bowl. At the beginning of 
this year, I would have said 
Greg Lloyd, but Lloyd followed 
Woodsons lead and is going to 
miss the year, but the Steelers 
defense keeps rolling. Carnell 
Lake, Chad 
Brown, and 
Levon
Kirkland all receive honorable 
mentions, but this award has to 
go to Bill Cowher. The players 
believe in him and his staff and 
just about every move hes made 
the past few years (with the 
exception of the Jim Miller fi
asco) has worked.
Best Fathers Day Present: 
Anthony Dorsett of the Houston 
Oilers wins this one easily. By 
playingin last weeks game against 
Pittsburgh, the combination of An
thony and his more famous father, 
Tony, are now the second highest 
scoring father-son combination in 
NFL history. Of course, Anthony 
has yet to score a point.
Best Free Agent Move: It 
would be too easy to give this one 
to the Steelers Jerome Bettis, 
but maybe even more important 
than him was the signing of Will 
Woolford by the Steelers. This 
pick-up solidified an already 
strong offensive line that, even 
when beset by injuries, is among 
the best in the NFL.
Worst Free Agent Move: This 
is a group award to everyone who 
selected the New York Jets. They 
threw a lot of money out, the 
players collected, played, lost, and 
now all seem to be getting in
jured. First, Neil ODonnell, then 
Jeff Graham. Watch how many 
players dont accept the highest 
bid this off-season.
Best Offensive Performance 
by Someone Most People 
Have Never Heard Of: Leshon 
Johnson of the Arizona Cardi
nals wins this MATIMU. He 
rushed for over 200 yards in an 
early season game. 200 yards. No 
other player has done that this 
year. Not Barry Sanders, not 
Emmitt Smith, not Terrell Davis.

555 Grant Street  Suite 373
Best Offensive/Defensive 
Player: Dale Carter wins handsdown. Some guy in Dallas has 
tried the same thing, but I dont 
like his dancing.
Game of the Year: Green Bay 
and San Franciscos overtime 
thriller on Monday night. How 
badly do you think FOX execu
tives were crying as they watched 
the best game so far unfold on 
ABC. But they shouldnt cry too 
hard, they had Dallas/Miami this 
week, and will also have the 
highly anticipated Dallas/SF and 
Dallas/GB games.
Worst Football Show on TV: 
The Fifth Quarter wins in a land
slide. Is there anyone who would 
rather watch the 5th quarter on 
WPXI than a football game? Yes, 
Pittsburghers love the Steelers, 
but the majority love watching 
good football than watching an
other interview. Thats what the 
evening news is for.

With Dan Marino back, the 
over/under on passing yards
on this game should be some
where around 800 yards. Of 
course, the real battle will be be
tween Curtis Martin and Karim 
Abdul-Jabbar. Whoever rushes 
for more yards will lead his team, 
to victory.
Philadelphia at Dallas: If a 
play doesnt work on fourth down, 
Barry, the chances itll work on 
5th down are minimal. See if the 
Eagles can start pounding the 
nails in the Cowboys coffin.
Detroit at Green Bay: This 
weeks other aerial fest. The 
Lions have maybe the premier 
running back in the game, but 
they dont use him, so watch Scott 
Mitchell throw and throw. Brett 
Favre should have no problem 
keeping pace with him. Expect 
the Packs defense to score at 
least once in this one.

Hi
Last seasons basement squads playing big
From the Point
by Jason Andracki
The first two weeks of regu
lar season play have offered a 
few surprises. If you scan the 
standings, you see the Hart
ford Whalers and Dallas Stars 
leading their respective divi
sions. These two failed to make 
the playoffs last season, but 
are now in first place. The 
Edmonton Oilers and Ottawa 
Senators, who also started golf
ing early last year, are trailing 
in second place. Yes, I said the 
Ottawa Senators.
With the exception of the 
Stars, none of the teams had a 
lot of off-season changes that
that could have caused their 
early success. The Stars picked 
up Pat Verbeek, Sergei Zubov, 
and Arturs Irbe in the off-sea
son  Kevin Hatcher was their 
only significant loss. Mike 
Modano also received a new 
contract, and after his 
World Cup success he 
seems to be becoming the 
superstar he was always 
claimed to be. With 
Modano having Verbeek 
on his line, hes apt to have 
a career season.
Hartford didnt make many 
off-season moves, but they 
pulled off the biggest deal of 
the season just a week into 
play. It will take another 
blockbuster to top the trade 
that sent Brendan Shanahan, 
Bryan Glynn, and a 1997 first 
round pick to the Red Wings 
for Paul Coffey and Keith 
Primeau.
In four games as a Whaler, 
Primeau has four goals, but
Coffey, who at first refused 
to play for Hartford, has yet 
to make the scorecard. Sean 
Burke is continuing his stel
lar play that makes him one 
of the best underrated 
goaltenders, and backup 
Jason Muzzatti is impres
sive as well.
In Ottawa, last years 
Calder winner, Daniel 
Alfredsson, has yet to 
show any signs of a sopho
more slump. Hes helping 
the Senators get off to their 
best start in their five-year 
history, with help from Alexei 
Yashin and Alexander Daigle. 
Yashin and Daigle are fi
nally playing up to the 
worth of their multi-million 
dollar contracts after being 
busts so far.
Edmontons success can 
be summed up in one name 
 Curtis Joseph. After lead
ing Team Canada to the 
World Cup Finals, Joseph
has a 5-3 record, including one? 
shut-out in the first two weekf-g 
of play.
Doug Weight and Jasor) 
Arnott are playing as expectecj* 
but the Oilers are getting praj 
duction from an unexpected 
source, rookie Rem Murray. 
Murray has five goals and four 
assists, and is among the to]ffi 
rookie scorers. If he continues 
this play, he may be the first 
Calder winner in Edmonton.
So far, these four teams seemed" 
to have reversed their play from' 
last season. Its only two weekJ 
into the season, so its hard to tell" 
whether they will still be playoff-;' 
caliber teams in March, but if" 
will make for an interesting sea-_ 
son if they can.

The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania28 October 199g
CMU dominates Chicago in Homecoming match
By DAWN PAPUGA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellon University plowed 
over the Maroons this past Saturday in 
an incredible display of 
football talent. The Tar
tans had a great game
 especially in the first 
quarter, in which they 
scored 28 points.
The Tartans scored 
early on and just didnt 
stop. Their first drive 
was five plays long, end
ing with a 70-yard pass 
to j unior Rick Steiner for 
a touchdown. The extra 
point was blocked, leav
ing the score 6-0 in fa
vor of the Tartans.
The next Tartan 
touchdown was spurred 
on by senior Nate 
Morgans interception.
This led to a drive of 
four plays for 35 yards.
Senior Buck Neal made it across the 
goal-line for the second touchdown of 
the game, and also was the receiver for 
the successful two point conversion. Neal 
had a second touchdown, late in the first 
quarter, that was seven plays and 57 
yards long.
On the next drive, there were some 
very good efforts made by the team to
keep up their lead. When senior Dave 
Soltysiks pass was tipped by a defender, 
junior Ricco Parish made a great saving 
catch and took the ball for an additional 
22 yards. This game saw a very deterFLHyTPr ftT4G8g1TZeTgyT4 9hryrtgTSh8g
Junior defensive back Phil OHara intercepted a pass at the end of the 
first quarter to advance the score to 28-0.
mined Tartan team in the first quarter.
By the end of the quarter the score was 
28-0.
In the second quarter, Parrish had 
another touchdown for 62 yards. That 
drive lasted four plays and 85 yards 
long, bringing the score to 35-0.
The defense played a strong game, not 
giving up any points. Junior defensive
back Phil OHara picked off a ball in the 
first quarter, and ran it back for a touch
down. He also had an interception in the 
second quarter. Junior Chad Heald and 
senior Todd McManus both had sacks 
that were for losses, and jun
ior Adam Kenny had a 
fumble recovery.
The Tartans seemed to be 
dealing a shut-out to Chi
cago, but late in the second 
quarter, Soltysik was blind
sided and sacked. This led 
to a fumble recovery and 31 
yard touchdown run by Chi
cago. But by the end of the 
first half, the games score 
was 35-7.
The Tartans scoring drive 
wasnt over with the half. In 
the third quarter, freshman 
Mike Campie had 67-yard 
touchdown run, and the Tar
tans got the extra point. This 
then brought the score to a 
game ending 42-7.
Because of the high scor
ing in the first quarter, there were a lot 
of different players on the field in the 
second half. By games end there were 
14 different rushers that contributed to 
the 400+ yard game.
The outstanding player of the game 
was senior quarterback Dave Soltysick, 
who was named the ECAC player of the 
week. He passed for 200+ yards, and
was 12 of 14, a season high for the 
seasoned QB.
This win puts the Tartans into conten
tion for the UAA title, now with a record 
of 6-2 and 2-1 in the division. There 
were doubts that the Tartans would be 
able to turn themselves around after 
their 0-2 start, but the team is currently 
on a six-game winning streak.
Last weeks 20-13 victory over the 
University of Washington is without a 
question the highlight of the season. 
Washington was ranked first over
CMU in the pre-season, and the Tar. 
tans shared the conference title with 
the Bears last season. But an 83-yard 
touchdown pass to Parish with 3:25 
left in the game broke the 13-13 tie 
and gave CMU the win. Sophomore 
Jason Funke clinched the win with hiy 
third interception of the game 
Carnegie Mellons 30-yard line wi 
19 seconds left in the game.
The Tartans next host the University 
of Rochester on Saturday, November 2 
at Gesling Stadium at 1:30 pm.

Mens soccer battles Emory to stalemate
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Staffwriter
; After falling to Point Park last 
week, and seriously hurting 
their post-season hopes, the 
mens soccer team returned this 
week with strong performances 
against Penn State-Behrend 
and top-rated UAA rival Emory 
University.
The team put in a solid per
formance against Penn State 
with a 1-0 victory. Sophomore 
forward Harry Ulrich scored the 
game-winning goal. With the 
victory, CMU could now think 
about their next opponent, 
Emory.
CMU headed into the Emory 
game as clear underdogs. Emory 
was coming into the game with 
a number of things in their fa
vor. The No. 1 scorer in the 
UAA plays for Emory, as well 
as two other players in the top 
five. They were ranked No.l in 
the region and number 10 in 
the country for division III. This 
is compared to CMUs one player 
in the top five scorers and a tenthplace ranking in the region.
From the beginning of play, 
the teams fought for control of 
the ball and the game. In the 
first half, sophomore forward 
Harry Ulrich worked the ball 
down the left wing, and sent a 
crossing pass to junior forward 
Jason Buelow whose low, hard 
shot went just wide to the left. 
Later in the half, freshman 
midfielder John Petrillo sent the 
ball into the penalty area to 
senior midfielder Suraj Naik.
The Emory goalie deflected the 
ball to outside the right side of 
the penalty area where sopho
more midfielder Wes Kopacka 
picked up the loose ball and 
took a shot that narrowly 
missed.
worked the ball together to earn 
a number of free kicks and 
throw-ins deep in the Emory 
defensive end. On defense, the 
Tartans did whatever was nec
essary to protect the goal and 
freshman keeper Ben Kartzman.

Sophomore forward Harry Ulrich fights past an Emory defender.
At halftime neither team had 
been able to score a goal, or to 
create a sustained attack. The 
second half would also end in a 
tie, sending the game into over
time. However, for the entire 
half CMU showed a hunger to 
control the ball that Snickers 
just would not satisfy. In the 
offensive end Ulrich and Buelow
At one point Naik risked life and 
rugburned limb when he slid 
five yards on the carpet to deny 
a shot to an Emory halfback.
With the clock ticking down 
in the second half, the Tartans 
took control of the game and 
created the most sustained at
tack of the game. In the last ten 
minutes alone, CMU earned five
throw-ins and two corner kicks 
within 30 yards of the Emory 
goal. Even with the sustained 
pressure, Emory wouldnt 
break, and the Tartans were 
faced with overtime.
Two non-sudden death over
time periods were played. CMU 
was unable to resurrect their 
late second-half surge, and the 
game was once again played 
back and forth with neither 
team controlling. With seven 
minutes left, an Emory forward 
split the defense and walked in 
on Kartzman alone. A tippy-toe 
save from the rookie goalie was 
all that stopped Emory from 
breaking the stalemate. The 
game continued, and the Tar
tans could not regain control of 
the game. With under thirty 
seconds left in the half, Emory 
got one last shot off that was 
destined for the net, once again 
denied by Kartzman.
The game ended in a tie and 
CMUs post-season questions 
became even more difficult to 
answer.
As much as the Tartans didnt 
win, they played a tough game 
against a team that was sup
posed to beat them. The tie may 
not be enough to push them 
into the NCAA tournament, 
however it should lift their rank
ing and raises the odds of an 
ECAC tournament appearance.
The team returns to action

CMU swim teams 
train for season
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Staffwriter
The swim season, as any CMU 
swimmer will tell you, is long. 
Practices began in late Septem
ber, and until the season ends 
with UAA Championships in midMarch, the 30-member squad will 
spend approximately two to three 
hours a day, six days a week, 
basking in the chlorine fumes of 
the University Centers pool.
The long season is rough," said 
mens team captain Tony Rippy, 
a senior. You have to watch that 
you dont get injuries. But for the 
most part, its good to have such a 
long season. It gets us in the 
shape we need to be in. The team 
is looking at a season filled with 
changes. In addition to the new 
pool at the University Center, the 
teams structure has changed. 
Womens captain Paige Angstadt 
noted that the womens team has 
14 women swimmers this year, 
with several new first-years. The 
womens team hasnt done so well 
in the past couple of years  we 
just havent had the depth. 
[Rebecca Fruehan], who gradu
ated last year, was a really great 
swimmer, but we didnt have the 
depth to gain points from secondand third-place finishes. But this 
year, we have that depth  well 
be counting on everyone, from 
the best down on through; The 
mens team also has a lot more 
people out for the team this year, 
according to Rippy.
Most significantly, however, is 
the presence of Dave Belowich, 
the new team coach. With, more 
than 18 years of coaching exfteri-! 
ence  12 as the University^! 
Pittsburghs head coach - 
Belowich brings a new style oi 
coaching to a tearw which needed 
direction after graduating sev 
eral champion swimmers;. '
A lot of the stuff is new. says 
Angstadt. But [Belowich] is 
ing with us really well as stt 
dents and as people. Swimmer; 
use swimming paraphernalia, 
such as paddles, fins, anc 
pullbuoys more often than thej 
did in previous years. He'video! 
tapes practices so the swimmer? 
can see how they are swimming 
With an average practice of 
about 5,000 yards per dayabout 
three miles  being on the team 
is no small matter. Unlike most 
varsity sports teams, the womensftj 
and mens teams operate as one 
creating a broader base of sup 
port for the swimmers. The team 
is really easy to get along with, 
says freshman Lori Hashimoto.
As captain, says Angstadt 
one of my jobs is to try to 
everyone close. Were a really 
close-knit team. Indeed, one 0 
the highlights of the CMU swim 
team experience is a training trip 
over winter break. Team mem
bers spend their winter vacatior 
at the International Hall of Fame 
Swimming Pool in Ft. Lauder 
dale, Florida, and train exteri 
sively for most of the break.
Carnegie Mellon ice hockey club solidifies play after 0-2-1 start
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon University 
hockey clubs twenty-sixth season 
started the first weekend in October 
with the team facing the Pittsburgh Stars 
on Saturday night at home and travel
ing away to meet Penn State West on 
Sunday night. Coming off a fabulous 
season last year, winning their division 
with a 11-1-1 record before losing in the 
semi-finals to PSW, the Tartans were 
expecting a great season in 1996-1997. 
But after being slapped by the Stars in 
exhibition play 5-4 on opening night 
and tying Penn State West in the final 
seconds of the Sunday, October 6 game, 
the team stumbled forth to meet Slip
pery Rock on Saturday, October 19 and 
were cut down again 4-2. The 0-2-1 
start was the worst in recent Tartan ice 
hockey history.
They needed a turning point and for
tunately they got it, a decisive 4-1 win
over New York University last Friday. 
The first practice in September was 
promising. Within two weeks of prac
tice, the squad had beefed up to almost 
thirty participants, with a core of over 
twenty players practicing consistently. 
Coach Fred Maddalena was pleased, but 
there was something very visibly miss
ing  forwards. Lost this season, to 
shoulder surgery, is one of the corner
stones of the Tartan hockey program for 
the past five years, graduate student 
Roger Maddalena. His leadership and 
goal scoring is vital to the future of the 
program. Missing also is sophomore for
ward Andy Oxnard. Though the defense 
returned for the most part, it has yet to 
be bolstered. The rookie crop is large, 
but their conditioning is not entirely 
ready for college-level play.
The first holes were revealed opening 
night, October 5, against the Pittsburgh 
Stars. The game was wild. In a span of 
six minutes, six goals were scored, three 
by each team. Strangely, it was two
defensemen with the first and last goals 
of the period, senior assistant captain 
Chris Adukaitis scoring seven minutes 
into the game off of a junior forward 
Scott Fitzgerald deflection. After the 
senior forward Anthony Paul goal one 
minute later, junior defenseman Bryan 
Campo scored off of senior forwards Relja 
Ivanovic and Jim Buck on the power 
play, to tie the game at three apiece at 
the first break.
The game was uneventful for the next 
two 17-minute periods. CMU was 
muscled around and outshot and was 
playing tired by the third period. The 
lone highlight of the third period was 
the power play goal by the rookie P.J. 
Gryzwacz from junior defenseman Paul 
Voulgaris. The Tartans were evenly 
matched on the power play, having two 
goals scored on their penalty killing units 
and scoring two themselves. Senior 
goaltender Jon Kleigman had nineteen 
saves in the first two periods of play 
while back-up rookie goalie Gil Min had
three saves in the final period. But it 
was the Stars who dominated along the 
boards and CMU limped off the ice in 
defeat, 5-4.
The Tartans were pumped up again by 
Sunday night when they traveled to 
meet Penn State West. The game was a 
rematch of CMUs one-goal loss to PSW 
in last seasonls league semi-finals.
Right away, the first line pounced and 
Ivanovic scored off of Buck to put the 
Tartans up 1-0. The superb drive to the 
net was unfortunately not followed up 
by the rest of the team. Passes were 
getting choked at the red line, causing a 
lot of turn-overs. The play was evenly 
matched physically, but the Tartans 
were simply not driving to the net. In the 
first period alone, PSW was outshooting 
CMU 20-9, much to the chagrin of stone
wall goalie Kliegman who was very busy 
making acrobatic saves in net. He was 
visibly the only thing keeping CMU in 
the game.
The second period looked the same:
little shooting on CMUs part, heads-ujj 
play by the goalies and defense but a lo( 
of scrambling around with the pu<$ 
Penn State West attacked the net with ! 
greater vengeance when Coacl 
Maddalena changed goalies halfwa] 
through the period, but not befori 
Kliegman had made nine more saves 
Soon afterwards, two pucks slipped p 
relief goaltender freshman Gil Min, but 
both were disallowed by the referees 
one on high stick call, the other because 
of a man in the crease. After two periods. 
CMU was still holding their lead at 1-0. 
even after three power-play attempts 
PSW. Injured Captain Maddalena said 
Our defense was doing a good jc 
cutting down their offense and stayu^ 
between the puck and our goaltende* 
and not letting them go down on * 
breakaways, but they were outshootmi 
us by a lot.

native health methodologies and phi
losophies, and specifically on Eastern 
health practices.
I wanted to know what yoga and 
acupuncture was, said Soultanian. I 
wasnt getting enough information from 
people, so I decided to bring them [ex
perts] in myself.
Twenty-five people, including students 
and staff, are registered for the course, 
and about 30 show up for the weekly 
lectures, according to Soultanian. There 
seems to be a real interest in these 
things, she said.
Students in the course receive three 
units of credit. The course was 
Soultanians idea and is part of her 
Community Impact Project as a fifth 
year scholar. Her focus as a scholar has 
been exploring what it takes to lead a 
healthy life.
Soultanians motivation for designing 
the course has been influenced heavily 
by personal experience. I had been in a 
bad car accident.... No one was hurt, but 
I realized that the stress from the acci
dent had affected my body, even though 
there was nothing wrong [physically], 
said Soultanian.
She has found that by just talking
and thinking through her experience,; 
she has been helped. This is the kind of 
help and therapy Soultanian hopes her 
students will get from her course, and; 
she has observed that some of the prac
tices introduced have had that effect. :
Some of the lectures held so far! 
have included a sleep therapist, a; 
multi-skilled therapist, and an ex
pert in Shiatsu.
The sleep therapist,an expert on a 
topic pertinent to many CMU students 
lives, discussed such topics as how body 
temperature affects sleep patterns and 
necessary quantities of sleep. However, 
Soultanian said, the most interesting 
topic seemed to be dreams and dream
ing. She described the therapists story 
of a cancer patient who repeatedly 
dreamed about cleaning out a garage 
(akin to cleaning out her body). In time 
the woman cured herself of the cancer.
The multi-skilled therapist, as 
Soultanian called her, spoke of writ
ing to relieve stress. The students in 
the class participated by writing jour
nal entries and by going on a guided 
tour through our heads, said 
Soultanian. According to the thera
pist, writing is paramount to stress 
relief and healthy living.
Shiatsu, Japanese pressure therapy, 
was another topic covered in the class. 
Soultanian, the lucky guinea pig on 
whom a demonstration was performed, 
~had one comment about it, It [the 
therapy] was totally cool.
Classes for the remainder of the se
mester will include aroma 
therapy; homeopathy, a practice utiliz
ing herbs to increase symptoms in an 
affected body in order to aid it in ridding 
itself of the sickness; a visit from the

UC brings new fitness facilities
By DANIELLE PEERRATTI
Tartan Staffwriter
The glass doors of the new 
weight room in the University 
Center sport a large sign that 
ds: Personal Trainer Availe. If you need more exercises 
assistance with your program the 
maximum benefit, just ask  
e. It is just one example of 
the efforts that go into develop
ing and maintaining the UCs 
new fitness center as a conve
nient place for students to ex
ercise, improve their health, 
and have fun.
The blank slate that the Uni
versity Center started out with 
this year has been colored by the 
amount of student participation 
that it has received in just two 
months. According to Tony 
Wingen, the assistant athletics 
director for Facilities in the Uni
versity Center, this is due to the 
feet that even before it was 
opened, the objective of the Uni
versity Center was to provide stu
dents with the facilities to allow 
r greater recreational exercise 
and activity. That means almost 
no varsity sports in the UC and 
an increase in the number of free 
hours for recreational usage.
Due to sports and classes, the 
Skibo Gym that served the school 
Prior to the UCs opening could 
nly accommodate recreation 
three days out of seven in the 
'veek. It was also lacking in 
Other are as such as the 
raquetball courts.
In these times our students 
are much more health and fit
ness conscious. I really felt bad 
about the fact that we werent 
able to provide more recreation
time, said Wingen.
With the construction of the 
Weigand Gymnasium, two swim
ming pools, five racquetball and 
squash courts, and an aerobics 
and activity room that features 
the latest in Cybex fitness equip
ment, things were turned around.
Its allowed us to greatly ex
pand the services we can provide 
to students, staff, and faculty, 
he said. With this building open
ing and Skibo Gym still being in 
operation were able to provide 
recreational space about 90% of 
the time that were open, which is 
a tremendous improvement. We 
were [providing space for recre
ation] far less than half the time 
with our old facilities. As a re
sult of this and the accessibility 
and size of the new center, the 
number of students who have 
been able to use the various fa
cilities, such as the pools, has 
greatly increased this year. 
Weve seen a marked increase in 
the usage and the number of 
swimmers, Wingen said.
To compliment these new fa
cilities, the fitness center also 
offers a wide array of instruc
tional classes, such as racquet
ball, squash, lifeguarding, three 
levels of swimming classes, and a 
wide variety of aerobics includ
ing aqua aerobics. According to 
Wingen, many students have ben
efited from these as well, due to a 
better teaching environment and 
the possibility of larger classes.
All the instructors I have had 
are very upbeat. They have good 
workouts that incorporated 
aerobics, weights, and abdomi
nal exercises. They keep us going 
the whole time but they are also 
fun. They also seem very con
cerned about formmaking sure 
we wont injure ourselves, letting 
us know what we are working. 
They know what theyre doing, 
said Megan Franke, senior BHA 
major.
Despite this apparent success, 
however, the University Center 
staff is always eager to improve 
the facilities. As with any new 
building, designs are constantly 
being reworked. There are still 
things that need to be ironed out, 
Wingen said.
One concern is over the place
ment of the aerobics and weight 
rooms so close to the dining area.
According to Wingen, some 
screening and reconfiguring 
are in the works to improve 
this situation.
It makes you a little self-con
scious at first but its not a huge 
deal. Sometimes people stop and 
stare but you get used to it, said 
Franke.Theres also a problem 
with ventilation. It doesnt seem 
like the room gets much air.
However, despite any minor 
complaints, most are very satis
fied with the way that the Fit
ness Center has turned out.
Its been a tremendous boost 
to our operations.... Just to walk 
through this building and see the 
amount of use its getting and the 
looks on peoples faces are enough 
to show me that everybodys 
pretty happy with it, said 
Wingen.
Classes at the Fitness Center 
are taught by members of the 
Athletic Departments staff and 
recreational hours occur 
throughout the day. For more

Fifth Year Scholar Program honors exceptional seniors
BY SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriter
. Exceptional undergraduate students 
are offered the opportunity to continue 
their studies for another year with the 
Fifth Year Program. Heather Midkiff, 
Coordinator of Student Activities and 
organizer of the Fifth Year Scholar Pro
gram believes the scholars are some of 
the brightest and most well-rounded stu
dents to attend CMU. These students 
contribute so much to the University. 
They have been involved in programs, 
organizations, and other interests at CMU 
since their first year, said Midkiff. They 
are bright, capable community members, 
and leaders.
Each scholar receives tuition for their 
fifth year as well as a $6000 stipend. 
During their fifth year, scholars are able 
to take courses in any area they choose. 
In addition, each scholar works on an 
individual project which will somehow 
benefit the CMU community, 
i Denise Soultanian, an art major with 
an industrial management minor is a 
current fifth year scholar. For her project, 
Soultanian created an alternative health 
course. I thought it would be a good way 
to expose students to health, she said. I 
know that most students, when they think 
about health, think its about going to the 
doctor and getting drugs. This course 
shows that its much more than that.
Soultanians class is a minicourse. Each 
day, a different lecturer speaks to the 
class. Topics have ranged from sleep 
therapy to relieving stress with journal 
writing. One of Soultanians favorite 
lectures dealt with Shitzu. She said, 
Shitzu literally means finger pres
sure. It was a great class because 
the students had to find partners 
and actually practice doing the pres
sure therapy on each other.
Soultanian is happy with the feed
back she has gotten from students as 
well as the impact her project has on 
the commnity.
She said, I give evaluations at 
the end of each class, and Ive gotten 
positive comments. The students love 
the class. Whats cool is that the 
school wants to continue the course.
Its something I started in my fifth 
year and its going to go on.
Students enrolled in the course 
are graded based on two homework 
assignments. Approximately twenty 
five students are taking the class, 
but Soultanian urges anyone to come 
listen to the lectures.
Jill Goodall, another current scholar, is 
a psychology major focusing her fifth 
year studies on public relations. For her 
project, Goodall is working to improve 
student activities on campus. She con
tributes to event planning workshops 
and she is developing a web site for stu
dent activities. In -addition, she is AB 
chair working on the improvement of the 
organizations effectiveness on campus. 
Goodall believes her contributions, as
fB.r4T ArZeTgyT4 Egy lrU8'Byrg
well as those of other scholars, better the 
CMU community in a number of ways. 
She said, Since each of us does commu
nity-related projects, the campus ben
efits. Most scholars are people who work 
on campus, and being here as a fifth year 
scholar gives us the chance to do more for
the campus, particularly if it becomes 
the focus of a project.
Kerry Hagan, an electrical, computer 
engineering and music composition ma
jor, feels she has gained a great deal 
by working on her project. She urges 
prospective applicants for the schol
arship to plan an innovative and ef
fective project. I think when some 
people apply, they think of them
selves, she said.
I know I was guilty of this. But 
what you come to realize is that the 
program allows you to do something 
for you and something for the univer
sity. The project is such an integral 
part of the scholarship. My best ad
vice for students would be to consider 
your project thoughtfully. This pro
gram is not a one way thing. 
Soultanian agrees.
She said, I advise students to have 
a good project that can truly benefit 
the school. I read a lot of essays from 
other scholars. The strong ones were 
the realistic proposals that the school 
can do.
The program not only gives schol
ars the chance to incorporate their 
projects into university life, but it also 
lets them enroll in classes that they did 
not have the time to take during their 
undergraduate years at CMU.
For example, Hagan, who was unable 
to fulfill the requirements to complete
both her music and ECE majors due to 
time constraints during her undergrade 
ate program, feels the Fifth Year Scholar 
Program allows her to focus her energies 
on one area and consequently, get both 
of her degrees.
Im a musician first. During my fo^ 
years here, I had to fight my natural 
desire to do the best I could do at every! 
thing. I found myself making sacrifice^ 
in music and sacrifices in engineering, 
Now, I can concentrate on one thing. The 
reason I havent done as well as I could in' 
the past is because I spread myself so 
thin.
The scholars are excited about tfy 
classes they are taking through the pro.- 
gram.
Though their workloads are muchful]ei; 
this year, most scholars do not feel over, 
burdened with work.
Soultanian said, Its more work, but I 
love it. This year is both fun and exciting,
I put 110% into the classes Im taking 
and the one Im teaching. I want every; 
thing I do to be the best it can be.
Anyone interested in applying for tht 
Fifth Year Scholarship should contact 
Heather Midkiff at x8-1281 or stop by the 
Office of Student Activities.
Information sessions will be held on 
Tuesday from 4-5pm in the Donner Read
ing Room, and Wednesday from 5 -6pm, 
in the Donner Reading Room.
Students discuss sex frankly
By ANDREW WANG
Tartan Staffwriter
Sex and Judaism was the topic of the discus
sion sponsored by Hillel this past Friday. This 
event was the first in a series of monthly open 
discussions on how current topics relate to Judaof love between a husband and wife, a good in and 
of itself quite apart from the mitzvah [religious 
duty] to propagate, said Donsky. Jewish tradi
tion also holds that legitimate sexual pleasure is 
a divine gift for which God is to be thanked.
The discussion also examined the issue of con
traception. According to traditional Jewish be' ism. We figured that wed start with [the topic of lief, it is the mans obligation to propagate, and
sex and Judaism] because it would draw peoples 
attention, said Rabbi Art Donsky, the executive 
director of Hillel, and also the leader of the 
discussion.
Judaism is being part of a people, and there
fore being part of a people means it is a way of life,
'that Judaism teaches us a variety of things about 
how we live our daily lives, said Donsky as the 
discussion began. Its not just about what you 
believe in or what your faith is, but about how 
you eat your meal, how you interact with your
"... sexuality in its proper status 
and its proper relationship is some
thing positive and good...
Rabbi Donsky, about 
"Sex and Judaism 
friends, and how you have relationships of a 
significant nature.
Approximately fifty guests attended the din
ner and discussion. Each participant was given 
a seventeen page handout on the topic of Juda
ism and sex, including Jewish references from 
many different sources, such as the Torah, writ
ings from different rabbi and contemporary Jew
ish writings.
In Judaism, sexuality in its proper status and 
its proper relationship is something positive and 
good, not something that is evil... it is something 
God created, said Donsky. He backed up this 
statement with references to the book of Genesis, 
and said The first command in the Bible is to be 
fruitful and multiply. 
Throughoutthediscussion.differentreferences 
on sexuality were drawn from the three thou
sand years of Jewish history.
Donsky pointed out that although there is no 
single Jewish view on sexuality, the majority of 
Jewish teachers hold that the sex instinct, cre
ated by God, cannot be unworthy.
In Jewish tradition, the proper place for inti
mate sexual relations is in marriage. Jewish 
teachers see sex as the most intimate expression
he cannot do anything to interfere with propaga
tion. Thus from this traditional perspective, the 
man may not use a condom, though the woman is 
free to use contraception.
But in modern Jewish life, issues have 
changed. The issue becomes 'Do you use a 
condom because you might be saving a life, 
said Donsky.
Many of the references in the handout on 
Judaism and sex said that sex is holy and pure 
when done in the proper time and with the 
proper intention. So what does 
it mean by proper intention? 
asked Donsky.
The intentions of procreation, 
pleasure, and love were deemed 
by the discussion group as hav
ing the proper intention, while 
sex without consent, such as 
rape, did not have the proper 
intention.
Finally, the discussion moved 
to the issue of premarital sex. One of the sources 
the discussion group examined was a reference 
from the book A Contemporary Approach to 
Jewish Sexuality by Rabbi Arthur Green, which 
introduces a graded scale of sexual values.
At the very top of this scale would stand sex in 
marriage, while rape or unconsenting sexuality 
would stand at the bottom.
Somewhere in the middle of the scale would be 
the relationship of two fully consenting persons 
such as in premarital sex, which is neither glori
fied nor condemned.
Another source that the group examined, The 
Jewish Way in Love and Marriage by Rabbi 
Maurice Lamm, condemned premarital sex.
He said, The act of sexual union, the deepest 
personal statement that any human being can 
make, must be reserved for the moment of total 
oneness.
Clearly in Jewish tradition, there is a proper 
time, proper place, and a proper intent. And at 
the same time, the sexual act, sexuality, and 
sensuality in Judaism is not something that is 
looked upon as sinful and evil or dirty, but 
rather as a gift of God, said Donsky as he 
concluded the discussion.

CMU lacks student leaders
EXIT
ON MY WAY OUT
by Eric Salzman
My freshman year I told a gradu
ate student who had been here for 
many years that I didnt think 
that CMU had any strong leaders. 
I didnt see any 60s-Berkeley type 
leaders who could rally the stu
dent body for a cause.
He told me that I was wrong and 
that this school does indeed have 
many capable leaders. I think he 
considered himself to be one of 
those leaders  he was not.
There are two types of leaders: 
those who are granted authority 
and gain a following because it is 
their position to have people follow 
them  and there are 
those who lead 
through example 
and gain a follow
ing because others 
are naturally drawn 
to them. The ideal is 
when the same per
son embodies both 
characteristics. When 
a person is both a natu
ral leader who attracts others and 
a holder of an official position of 
authority, the leader has the po
tential to make a significant im
pact on an organization, campus, 
community, or society.
The potential for impact comes 
from the power that one gains 
with being a leader.
Being able to communicate to 
others in such a manner so that 
they will act under the leaders 
influence and guidance is a great 
power for an individual to have. 
With great power, comes respon
sibility.
Two years ago, as Student Body 
President, Declan McCullaugh 
abused that power and failed to 
fulfill his responsibilities. His 
abuse of power led to his ousting. 
The student body was left feeling 
a little bewildered as to how it 
could have elected a leader who 
was not even taking classes. More 
importantly, the students were 
left with a feeling of distrust for 
their leaders. Part of the job of 
subsequent leaders was to re
gain that trust, a task that is 
not helped along by abandon
ing office once elected. 
Those who lead by ex
ample may excuse them
selves from their roles 
with the argument 
that they never sought 
to lead. However, those 
who lead through offi
cially granted author
ity as well as by
:
example owe something, to thosi 
who grant them that authority 
and to any others who may be 
affected by the leaders actions. ( :
Be it big business, national poli
tics, or even university organize 
tions, leaders are expected to meet 
certain criteria. First of all, they 
ought to fill the role that theV 
have taken. Secondly, they musj' 
perform as capable leaders when 
in that role. To shirk responsibitf 
ties when they had been previ 
ously sought out is insulting to 
the people who granted them that 
authority. Power through leader
ship is not something to be toyed 
with like a whimsical walk 
through the park when one can' 
freely choose to walk at random 
down any given path.
When leaders abandon theiL 
roles, their followers often feel be
trayed and belittled. Power is ustf 
ally not given lightlyit requires 
a lot of trust. For a leader to break 
that trust is to alienate a 
and make that people less trusting 
of their next potential leader.
As has been said time and time 
again, Carnegie Mellon is at a 
crucial point. Everyone knows how 
the school has done an aboutthis year in terms of spirit 
pride; however, every time a 
leader, recognized and authorized 
by the students, rejects the role of 
leadership, the school takes a blow 
against the progress it has made:
This school does have some dy
namic and inspiring leaders onite 
campus. Now is the time for those 
people to face their responsibili
ties with pride and enthusiasm, 
not to shrink away from them.
Eric Salzman is a senior phi
losophy major.

Tartan News Editor
Just sit and think.
-This is the inscription on the bench 
outside of Baker Hall that was do
nated in memory of the late history 
professor Richard Schoenwald. Now, 
through the efforts of the College of 
humanities and Social Science as well 
ag professor Schoenwalds former stu
dents and admirers, H&SS students 
have more than a bench on which to sit 
and think  they have a completely 
ffenovated and updated lounge.
The dedication of the Richard L. 
Schoenwald Student Lounge took place 
last Friday. He would love that the 
lounge is for students to come and sit 
and talk, said Erwin Steinberg, pro
fessor of English and long-time friend 
)f Schoenwalds. He would love that.
I think this lounge has been at the 
6nd of the hall for so many years, and 
ts nice to now have it light and cheerul like he was. Its representative of 
lim  its cultured, said Hillary Mas
ters, professor of English.
The lounge, located in Baker Hall 
254C, has a brand new stereo system, 
microwave, television, VCR, and it is 
decorated with art that was either in 
Schoenwalds office or that he person-r 
filly admired.
We ... came up with the idea that

CMU remembers esteemed professor by dedication of lounge
using Schoenwalds typewriter in a 
piece of artwork, and Nina Sweeny 
designed and built the piece with the 
input of Schlossman and Schoenwalds 
wife, Audrey. Nina worked closely 
with myself and Audrey for a design 
that reflected Dicks modernist thinkand culture that would reflect 
Schoenwalds vision for his students.
We wanted to put art in it that repre
sented what his friends had created 
and he had liked, said Steve 
Schlossman, head of the History De
partment. Schlossman said all of the 
art came from the 
University Ar
chives except for 
the mobile created 
by Schoenwalds 
oldest son,
Michael, and the 
mixed media piece 
Untitled, by Rob
ert Lepper, former 
head of the CMU 
Art Department.
These two works 
were familiar sites 
in Schoenwalds 
office.
Another familiar 
artifact from 
Schoenwalds office 
that is now on per

the lounge is his 
manual typewriter.

The Schoenwald Lounge in Baker Hall welcomed friends, colleagues and 
students of the late Richard Schoenwald.
At the dedication ceremony, former 
students as well as colleagues gave 
their remembrances of Schoenwald, 
and expressed their feelings about the 
dedication of the lounge in his honor.
This space will be a place where 
students share knowledge and prob
lems, and I cant think 
of a person more de
serving of the honor of 
having it named after 
them.... I think its a 
very fitting tribute to 
Professor Schoenwald 
in that so much of what 
he was committed to 
was not just impart
ing facts, but making 
other peoples lives 
richer, said Dean of 
Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy.
We were delighted 
to have the opportunity 
to remodel the lounge. 
Student use has in
creased and we hope it 
will continue, not only 
during the day, but 
also at night for group 
activities, said Peter 
Stearns, dean of H&SS.
We regret the occasion, but the fact 
that we have the opportunity to dedi
cate this lounge to Professor 
Schoenwald is great. It is an appropri
ate juxtaposition.
[As a student], youre walking 
around... trying to survive classes and 
decide [what to do once you leave herejj 
but in the midst of all that confusion 
there was Schoenwalds class.... He 
was a remarkable teacher, said Jenn 
Huang, a former student of Professor 
Schoenwalds. I cant think of any
thing more appropriate to dedicate to 
him than a lounge like this where  
student can have a moment to appreriy 
ate the journey and not worry so much 
about the final destination.  : -
At the end of the ceremony, Amy 
Eubanks, co-president of the Histoty 
Society, presented Schoenwalds wife 
Audrey a leather-bound dictionary 
with Words Matter, a favorite ex
pression of Schoenwalds, embossed 
on the front cover.
It was very moving and very kind' bf 
Steve [Schlossman] to organize [th 
dedication ceremony], said Audrey 
Schoenwald. [The lounge] is very nice':2 
The lounge was made possible by 
various donations from Schoenwald?s

friends. Basically, people keep coming out of the woodwork, said 
Schlossman.

Homecoming welcomed alumni with opportunity to meet students

By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
This weekend, 1600 alumni 
nd visitors joined with the 
present Carnegie Mellon com
munity to celebrate this years 
Homecoming fesitvities.
, Homecoming has received a 
lot of negative press in the past 
few years, according to Christa 
Sherwood, the coordinator of 
Saturday nights 
galloween Cos
tume Party. This 
year a group of 
students decided 
to do something 
about what every - 
me keeps com
plaining about. HHHi 
The events be
gan Friday with the Homecom
ing bonfire on the grass behind 
Donner Hall, where a large 
number of students gathered to 
show their spirit and eat smores 
among friends. Many organiza
tions collaborated to coordinate 
this years events, including 
Student Alumni Relations 
Council, the Student Dormitory 
Council, Spirit of Skibo, the 
Kiltie Band, the bagpipers, the 
football team, the Scottie Dog, 
he cheerleaders, and the Stu
dent Activities staff.
After the traditional bonfire, 
Students were given the chance 
to experience several new 
events that were planned to 
attract students as well as 
alumni. Locked in The 0 on a 
Friday Night, written by Max 
Chittister, a junior creative
writing major, was performed 
in the University Center as a 
murder mystery for all students 
to participate in.
The characters were created 
by ten students, and all the 
characters were connected and 
placed into the mystery by 
Chittister. Directed by Hannah 
Rohlfs and performed by Scotch 
N Soda, the entire audience 
tried to solve a mystery, where
get older we put a higher 
on tradition.
- John Durr; class of 1956
a dean is dead and all the sus
pects are locked in the 0.
All the seats set out were 
filled and [everyone] really en
joyed the desserts, said Amy 
Poettinger, the coordinator for 
the murder mystery and a jun
ior architecture major.
Following the murder mys
tery, laughter hailed from the 
Wiegand Gymnasium as AB 
Comedy sponsored the perfor
mance of comedian Marc Moran. 
Again for this performance, the 
entire gym was filled and the 
positive response to Morans co
medic remarks proved the suc
cess of the show.
On Saturday morning, the 
third annual Highlander Games 
took place on the IM field, spon
sored by the Student Alumni 
Relations Council (SARC).
Named after the Scottish High
land Logging Games, partici
pants, in teams of four, vied for 
the Carnegie Cup, playing 
Tartan touch football and Scot
tish soccer and competing in 
the five-legged Highlander 
Race, the Braveheart Board
walk, and the Mad for Plaid 
Obstacle Course.
A Saturday afternoon lunch 
was organized in the Univer
sity Center gymnasium, where 
both current and 
past students 
were invited to 
meet and eat. The 
tables were full of
_____________ many generations
of people, as the 
class of 1966 was 
at a table near students seated 
from the class of 1995. Alumni 
brought their children and their 
grandchildren, and some even 
introduced their children as pro
spective CMU students.
This was the first Homecom
ing celebration Carolyn Muskat, 
a fine arts student of the class 
of1987, attended. I have a new 
perception of all my memories 
of being a student, she said.
For her and several other 
alumni, coming to this celebra
tion has reminded them how 
far their education from CMU 
has gotten them and the suc
cess that they have experienced 
since then. John Durr, a me
chanical engineering major 
from the class of 1956, said, As 
we get older, we put a higher 
priority on tradition.
Ivor S. Clarke, a sophomore 
IDS major, was seen dancing to 
the music of the bagpipes. He 
said, Its good to see that Tar
tan pride rages on even after 
four long years.
Chirag Shah, a freshman ECE 
major, and Andy Zimdars, a 
sophomore computer 
science major, watched 
the bagpipers perfor
mance, and also re
marked on the success 
of the alumni present 
at this years Homecom
ing. Its good to know 
that after four years 
and $100,000, there 
may actually be a 
chance that Ill be a suc
cess, said Shah.
One of the maj or high
lights of Homecoming 
weekend is the Parade 
of Classes and the foot
ball game.
Its fascinating to 
watch the parade go by, 
to see if you know any
body, said Sharon 
Menard, a math major Scotch
from the class of 1956.
According to Katrina Lutz, the 
Homecoming bonfire chair, 
Homecoming is a time for the 
campus, past and present, to 
get together and show their 
spirit.
Jill Goodall, the public relations chair and a fifth year 
scholar said, This is the first 
year that we have really united 
students to put on a full sched
ule of events. We would like the 
Homecoming Committee to be
come a tradition, like the Spring 
Carnival committee.

If theres anything a subculture hates, its the 
ittempt by outsiders to explain or define it, mainly 
lecause the media just loves to either sensationalize 
 make it more accessible to the mainstream 
iublic. So in the spirit of that spooky season of 
Ffalloween, I begrudgingly bring you the often-mismderstood GOTH. As a member of this genre, Id 
ike to get rid of the common misconceptions off the 
bat. People who think they are vampires and those 
dds that wear Marilyn Manson shirts every day are 
lot Goths, theyre lacking a grip on reality. Real 
joths do not worship the devil, smoke opium, have 
ales against wearing colors other than black, or 
peak in Shakespearean accents, and are not eterlally depressed. We are creatively-driven, unusudly intelligent, fascinated by all sides of the human 
londition, have an affinity for clove cigarettes, and 
prefer nice boots to other types of footwear. Oh yeah, 
and Goths often have a wicked sense of wit and can 
laugh at themselves, as many people cant.
The Origins of Goth
Goth is based on music and was birthed out of 
British Punk itself in the late-1970s. When art 
school students attracted to the freedom of the Punk 
aesthetic began to start their own bands, they fused 
the skeletal structure of the music with the theatrics 
if glitter rock (David Bowie), and a twisted spiritu
ality (The Doors). What resulted was a dark 
minimalist sound which came to be known as Postpunk, which encompassed both Goth and New 
Wave. The birth of Goth is often traced back to the 
Brst Bauhaus single Bela Lugosis Dead (1979), 
although punk bands such as Siouxsie and the 
Banshees, Joy Division, and The Damned later 
appropriated by the genre were existing since 1977. 
Almost immediately Goths were visibly identifiable: 
lunks dressed predominately in black with extrava
gant make-up schemes, versed in literature and art 
with an interest in the extremes of emotion.
As the legacy of Londons Batcave club spread to 
America (specifically Los Angeles) in the early1980s, 
the genre began to diversify. Rozz Williams founded
the metalish Christian Death on the American 
West Coast along with the campy thrash of 45 
Grave and the punk-influenced Kommunity FK 
and Psi-Com (Perry Farrells first band) just as 
England birthed Southern Death Cult, the Joy 
Division-esque Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, and the 
performance camp of Alien Sex Fiend. However, 
these bands pale in compari
son to the two who set the 
stage for the decade, The Sis
ters of Mercy with First and 
Last and Always (1985) and 
Floodland (1987) and The 
Cures Pornography (1983) 
and Disintegration (1989).
These four albums are con
sidered the decades master
pieces. It was also during the 
early-mid 80s that Gothic 
fashion began to envelop the 
extravagant medieval garb, 
lacy dresses, gypsy-wear, and 
androgynous bent so often 
seen today, and when vari
ous magazines devoted to the 
scene such as Propaganda 
first appeared.
As the 80s rolled to a close, 
a melding of Gothic and In
dustrial dance resulted in the 
crossover popularity of Nine 
Inch Nails and Ministry. Re
flecting this was the scenes 
appropriation of leather, la
tex, and PVC fetish-wear.
Adding a counterpoint to the 
Industrial,Ethereal music 
 a droning, lilting, atmo
spheric sub-genre  found 
homes on 4AD and Sam 
Rosenthals Projekt label, 
giving bands such as Black 
Tape for a Blue Girl and Dead Can Dance homes 
and drawing growing numbers of new-agers into

So whats a Trendy Barbie Doll 
Black to do with her free time 
Athis city when all the coffee is 
jone and the days depressing 
anter has grown stale? Well, 
Jth the exception of a major 
ance club dedicated purely to 
fe? style, Pittsburgh exhibits 
Qany of the earmarks of a suc:essful Gothic scene.
The major stumbling block of 
(ttsburgh bars and clubs, Pro"ibition-era alcohol laws, tends 
0 automatically make all dance 
%hts 21-and-over affairs. The 
nain hang-out is on Tuesday 
jights at Club Babylon, (Atwood 
street in Oakland) where a com
ment DJ spins classic Goth, 
Wave, and mainstream
Industrial. Metropol (Smallman 
St. in the Strip District) fea
tures Indotech on Wednesday 
nights with new and classic In
dustrial and old-school Techno, 
and Agony & Ecstasy/Gothic 
Tepes Lounge on Thursdays. 
Oaklands Upstage (Forbes 
Ave.), controls Friday nights, 
although dealing with a num
ber of drunk jocks tends to ei
ther annoy or humor most regu
lars. The lack of an all-ages 
night anywhere in the city may 
soon be remedied, considering 
that a large piece of the local 
scene is under the legal drink
ing age.
To keep up with the fashion 
and the music, Pittsburgh fea
tures an assortment of local in
dependent magazines, college 
radio shows, and clothing op
tions. P.M.S., the acerbically 
funny and in-your-face zine 
published by the most notice
able group of females in our 
Goth scene tends to get a load 
of regional attention, while 
smaller ones such as 3rd Nail, 
the fledgling Incubus, and the 
not-Goth-but-culturally-compatible HAVEN all offer in
sights and reviews of local and 
national happenings. Most of 
these publications are avail
able at the clothing, cosmetic, 
and fetish store Slacker, and 
the New Age/Occult store Eye 
of Horus in the South Side. 
Another hotspot is the record/ 
comic store Eides in the Strip 
District. For a bit of insight

First off you think of The Crow: Eric Dravens 
clown-white face and black tear-streaked eyes. 
The next thought you have is of a talk show with 
people who claimed to be vampires. They looked 
like they took Glossy 
Enamel White and used 
it' as foundation with the 
finesse of a monkey. 
These are two makeup 
styles that are not looked 
very highly upon in the 
goth scene, tending to 
denote someone who is 
very new to the scene, 
and are somewhat em
barrassing to see. These 
extremes tend to reflect 
back on everyone in the 
scene, and are Gothic 
fashion faux pas.
The stylistic nature of 
gothic makeup is what 
makes it stand out so 
well in clubs, on the 
street,and inmagazines. 
The traditional formula 
is a very pale (but not 
glaringly white) founda
tion/base, heavy black 
eyeliner usually in a 
Cleopatra style but of
ten with spidery pat
terns around the eyes, 
and very dark, usually 
black or deep burgundy/ 
purple, lips. All 
person really 
needs is one 
black 
eyeliner pencil with which he can 
do both his lips and eyes. The 
basic gothic-makeup starter kit 
would look something like this:
Jgite foundation (Manic Panic 
makes a very good white base 
that goes on subtly), one black/ 
deep red liner for liplining, a 
dark red or black lipstick, and a 
black eyeliner pencil for the eyes.
The more experienced goth will 
use items like liquid black 
eyeliner, which allows for more 
control and thinner lines for those 
intricate designs round the eyes, 
yet demands a very steady hand.
Or the goth will branch out to a 
very pale lipstick in silvery pink 
or light blue for that just crawled 
out of the casket look (check out 
Urban Decays line of industrialhued lipstick and fingernail pol
ish). Other techniques include 
taking black lipstick and putting 
it all around the eyes and then 
smearing it so that your eyes 
take on a sunken, zombie-ish,
Nik Fiend look. Or there are 
others (infamous Glittergoths
and some Perkygoths) who will plaster body 
glitter in various colors to their faces and some
times entire bodies for that mad fairy god
mother look.
Even in the small subculture that is goth, there 
are even tinier branches loosely based on different 
modes of dress. The most noticeable are those who 
dress in Victorian and turn-of-the-century cloth
ing, often called Antiquegoths, who are very el
egant and eye-catching. Then there are those 
goths upon whom no piece of clothing is free of 
safety pins and whose clothes look like they havbeen slept in for days, a style that is oft called 
Eurotrash or just Trashygoth. There are gothf$> 
previously mentioned as Glittergoths, who arl 
very attracted by shiny things, and have items in 
their closests such as silver leather hot pants. Or 
there are the goths who merely go for the bla$k 
jeans and black shirt, sometimes with a band on it^ 
sometimes without. These descriptions are just, a 
fraction of the different types of clothing thal 
goths wear.
The last, yet very important, aspect of goth 
makeup and fashion are hairstyles. These tend to 
fall into two main categories: Morticia Addams and 
Robert Smith (of The Cure). Hair color tends to be 
mainly black, but with burgundy and purple thrown 
in, and as always the shocking white. Those whg 
appreciate Morticias hair tend to wear it parted 
down the middle and as long as possible. A varia1- 
tion on this is the Cleopatra-style haircut, which is 
a chin-length bob with short bangs. The Robert 
Smith style of hair is basically acheived with a fevp 
bottles of hairspray, a prayer, and a hope for clear 
skies. Some goths compete to see who can get the 
highest hair, few settling for anything less than 
heaven. Such is the life of goth: slave to fashion?

Halloween events offer students spooky, fun alternatives
!i TRACY ODELL
Tartan Staffwriter
Remember being a kid when Halloween really 
was scary? Ghosts and goblins and vampires all 
H88.8' so frightening back then. Now they are 
not quite so daunting, probably because we are
the big kids 
masquerading 
as the ghosts and 
ghouls scaring little kids. Since the red rubber 
noses and multi-colored wigs do not leave you 
crying for your mommy anymore, it is time to try 
something new this Halloween. What could be 
scarier than riding around Pittsburghs haunted 
sites?
Pittsburgh Trolley Tours began their Trolley 
Tours of Terror on October 18 and will continue
them until after Halloween. The tour takes pas
sengers around Pittsburgh in 1920s-style trol
leys, stopping every so often to tell a ghost 
stfjry. It is not quite as scary as it 
could be since people do not actu
ally get to go into 
the haunted houses.
Instead they hear 
true stories or at 
least rumors be
lieved to be true 
about the what hap
pened inside of them 
and what they might 
see if they were able to 
explore inside.
The tour starts in the 
Strip District and travels 
mainly through Oakland and the 
North Side for an hour and fifteen minutes. An 
example of a typical stop is the residence of Dr. 
Brunrichter in the North Side. In 1901, the 
doctor decapitated five women in hopes of keep
ing their severed heads alive. Today this sight is 
rumored to be inhabited by ghosts. Other stops 
on the tour include the Pittsburgh Playhouse,
Bruce Hall at the University of Pittsburgh, and 
Three Rivers Stadium, which once was the sight 
of various forms of torture by Indians.
The ghost stories were researched by one of the 
tours guides through reading books and newspa
pers about Pittsburgh. Since the tour route was 
originally designed, so many new stories have 
come to light that next year the company 
plans to offer another tour of terror with 
completely new sites  maybe even one on 
the CMU campus. Who would have thought 
that Pittsburgh could have so many spooks? 
Molly Stahlman, owner of Pittsburgh Trolley 
tours and 1995 graduate of GSIA, started the 
company as a result of a class project at CMU.
According to Stahlman, the response has been so 
great to this first year of Halloween tours 
that she is expanding their schedule to 
offer the tours the Friday and Saturday 
following Halloween to fill all 
their requests. When not giv
ing tours of terror, the trolleys 
are available to be rented for wed
dings, office parties, and other gather
ings.
For those who think the trolley tour may
be a little too scary for them to handle, other 
Halloween festivities are available. There is a 
haunted Clippership cruise, the Halloween Fright. 
Fest at Station Square, and a haunted hayride 
and terror show at the Boardwalk in the Strip ; 
District. For those scaredy cats wanting to stay 
closer to home, activities are planned on campus 
like pumpkin carving and horror movies. Of 
course, if none of this appeals to you, there is 
always the traditional trick-or-treating. Just 
watch out for the ghosts.

Kresge presents solid performance
By ALEX LEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Of all the plays Ive seen, noth
ing has baffled me so much as 
Frank Wedekinds Spring Awak
ening. I left the theater unsure 
how I felt about anything. I know 
I didnt like it as much as the rest 
of the opening night audience did, 
but I also know that there were 
some marvelously written scenes 
and much superb acting. (See the 
play if only for Joe Frias secondact scene in his bathroom.)
Wedekinds script is about the 
anger, confusion, and, well, homi
ness of adolescence. And 
Wedekind doesnt pull punches 
in showing us every aspect of 
hose feelings. I dont want to 
give too much away, but let me 
just say that if youve never seen 
acircle-jerk before (and I hadnt), 
this play will be a great learning 
experience.
The script is a string of good 
scenes, one right after the other. 
But taken as a whole, it seems 
that Wedekind (as translated by 
Rick Foster) is traveling too many 
roads at once and they never seem 
a converge. We have numerous 
sub-plots: Moritz (Chris Conner) 
difficulty passing in school,
something like a romance devel
ops between Wendla (Sarah Rob
erts) and Moritzs best friend, 
Melchior (Cody Nickell), Frau 
Gabor (LaSchanda DeVaughn) is 
attracted to Moritz and makes 
little effort to hide it, and on and 
on. But all these things feel pre
cisely like sub-plots, storylines 
that are subordinate to something 
else: a central, dominant plot. 
But its difficult to figure out what 
that something else is, and thus 
it is difficult to unearth the real 
heart of the play.
Acting-wise, our leads, Roberts, 
Conner, and Nickell are tremen
dous  they commit, they listen 
to the other actors, and they take 
risks. Paul Zablockis direction 
never falters. Each scene is well 
staged, each actor seems moti
vated, each beat registers. Sets, 
costumes, lighting, sound  
theyre all great. Superb produc
tion values all around, and I rec
ommend seeing the production 
for those reasons alone.
So why am I ambivalent? I sim
ply cannot get away from the 
script (which, incidentally, was 
written over 100 years ago). Cer
tainly, it is not a bad script. One 
of its great strengths, particu
larly in the first act, is that the
characters talk about an issue 
without actually naming it, say
ing it. Dialogue like thiswhich 
is dramatic and reflective of hu
man behavioris extremely dif
ficult to write.
On the other hand, one cannot 
help but ask, could Wedekind have 
dealt with his issues  authority, 
sexual maturity, miscommunicationwithout certain bizarre and 
allegorical scenes with lots of 
smoke, big, scary masks, straitjackets, and headless bodies? All 
these scenes were well presented, 
granted, but the scenes them
selves were very weird. I didnt 
know what Wedekind accom
plished by making them so night
marish. Perhaps I was uncom
fortable because the play started 
off as a straight, apparently non
supernatural, humans-only 
drama, and when it got progres
sively weirder, I wasnt able to 
handle the change.
I suppose that gives me some
thing in common with 
Wedekinds characters. Coping 
(or not coping) with change is a 
dominant theme in the play  I 
think. Perhaps, because I am as 
confused and uncomfortable as 
the characters themselves, I can 
never really be sure of that.Goth subculture defies stereotypes
Fsep6l2 gr. STt8 A
Goth. Across the nation, it became rare to find a 
major city which lacked either a Goth club or a club 
that featured a Goth-Industrial dance night.
The Modem Goth
The 1990s witnessed three important, if negative, 
occurrences in the Gothic world. The massive com
mercial popularity of Nine Inch Nails has not only 
brought unwanted exposure to the scene, but has 
fostered a climate in which such poor main
stream copycat bands as Stabbing Westward, Type 
egative, and Marilyn Manson can cash in on the 
shock value and attract empty-headed teenyboppers 
(or doom cookies) to the rebellious Goth image. 
Secondly, mass-media has realized the eroticism 
and exoticism of vampires and the dark and myste
rious. Hence The Crow, the runaway popularity of 
Anne Rice and her Interview With the Vampire series 
of books, and the Vampire: the Masquerade liveaction role-playing games (which some inconsider
ate sods try to play in dance clubs.) These too have 
brought unwanted uneducated elements to the 
scene whom often appear on daytime talk shows, 
enforcing the public opinion that Goths are freaks of 
society. Third, in 1991 the Sisters of Mercy released 
their collection of early singles Some Girls Wander 
By Mistake, and Gothic Rock became bogged-down 
m Sisters clones such as (the admittedly good) Rosetta 
Stone and The Wake.
At the same time, Goth seems to be undergoing 
8omewhat of a renaissance. The acceptance of body 
piercing and fetishwear denote a relaxation of social 
attitudes towards self-expression. Fashion and cos
metics companies are rediscovering the seductive 
Quality of the mysterious, and are more willing to 
experiment with black and non-traditional hues. In 
addition to the dozen-or-so major magazines such as 
Carpe Noctem and Permission, there are hundreds 
f independent zines on the market. With over 
50,000 readers, alt.gothic is one of the most active 
sites on Usenet, a sounding board for some of the 
Rovers and shakers in the scene around the world, 
deluding band members, publicists, club owners, 
fashion designers, record labels, magazines, artists, 
Writers, and the like. It has been noted that an 
overwhelming majority of adult Goths are collegeeducated, often holding jobs in either creative or 
cmputer-oriented fields. No longer is there a single 
jlobal Mecca for the subculture, for national capital 
status can be claimed by London, Toronto, Perth,
New York, and San Francisco (the East and West are 
radically different). Musically speaking, the past few 
years have greeted a massive diversification of tal
ent, such as the 80s-influenced aggression of Sun
shine Blind, the infectious club grind of London After 
Midnight, the jazzy Deep Eynde, ethnicity-laden 
Faith and the Muse, This Ascensions soaring guitar 
and female vocals, and Siddals faerie daydream.
Wheres Goth-o?
When its said that Goths are drawn to the dark 
side of life, what is meant is that mystery, irony, 
emotion, and beauty are what captures their atten
tion. The concepts of antiquity, mortality, and reli
gion they find alluring, hence the fixation with 
cemeteries, crucifixes, and ankhs. Usually intellec
tuals, they enjoy reading philosophy, various reli
gious texts, and more poetry and prose than you can 
shake a dead cat at (Shelley, Byron, Rimbaud, 
Baudelaire, and Dylan Thomas are held in high 
regard). For a crash course in artistic tastes, read up 
on the Pre-Raphealites and Expressionists such as 
Klimt and Scheile. Goth homes are either decorated 
completely with posters, flyers, and paintings, or 
with loads of wall hangings, tapestries, candles, and 
softly lit. Due to equal parts androgyny and matu
rity, we tend to be more accepting of alternate 
sexualities than most. Goths frequent coffee shops, 
dance clubs, and have a strange affection for kitschy 
things like 80s pop music and anime, although I 
cant explain that Hello Kitty thing. Were fond of 
burning incense, but you will never find patchouli. If 
youre still holding stereotypes, get rid of the garlic 
just wear patchouli and well stay far away.
Dead and Buried
I know, youre wondering Well, wheres the spi
derwebs and witches and spooky stuff? Well you 
see, its all a big self-deprecating joke that nobody 
but Goths get, sorta like how Beavis and Butthead 
are making fun of their audience. A fair number of 
Goths do practice a harmless Celtic nature religion 
named Wicca, which is often mistaken for dat ol 
black magic, but I assure you that human and 
animal sacrifice is not part of it. In short, dont try to 
impress us by wearing plastic fangs, Hey Morticia 
is not a pick-up line, we are not all homosexual, and 
the only funeral we may be heading to is your own if 
you feel the need to ask.
Have a happy Halloween, and dont forget to hug 
a Goth today. If you dont want to do that, remember 
that we prefer Oreos. The/re black, you know...
Local Goth scene flourishes
Fsep sRe2 gr. STt8 A11
(88.3 FM) features Firedances with Mike Salo 
(Monday mornings 9-12 am) and Dancing at 
Lughnasa (Wednesday nights 8-12 pm), while 
WPTS (92.1 FM) has Ethereal and more on Sky 
Gone Black (Saturdays 6-8pm), and Goth-Industrial on Beneath the Wheel (Sunday nights 
11 pm-1 pm). For more clothing, South Side, 
Oakland, and Shadyside feature many thrift 
and vintage shops specializing in antique and 
period clothing, often black and lacy.
The local music scene is fertile and diverse to 
say the least. MACE, an Industrial dance 4- 
piece, are currently the areas biggest draw, 
while the more performance-oriented Venus 
in Furs are underground favorites. The oldest 
of the bands, The Garden, walk the line be
tween lush Brit-pop and Ethereal, and have 
several popular independent releases under 
their belt. Low Sunday Ghost Machine (my 
pick to go the furthest), are noticeably influ
enced by early Cure, but feature strong song
structures which often branch out into dron
ing ambiance (do yourself a favor and buy 
their CD, you wont be disappointed). The 
campy Carmillas Dress explore the origins of 
the genre with a creepy skeletal collapse remi
niscent of Alien Sex Fiend. Other bands in
clude the electronically-oriented Next Level 
X, MacroNympho, Telecorps, and the currently 
missing in action Vampire Nation (for info on 
upcoming shows, see The Tartan calendar).
In short, the Pittsburgh scene is growing 
once again on a solid foundation, and the 
opportunities are everywhere, so if youre in
terested in checking it out, a good place to 
start would be the local Halloween gala, Noc
turnal Ecstasy II, Thursday night at Charlies 
(Forbes Ave. at Duquesne University). Re
member, be respectful of folks youre about to 
meet, because under all the make-up, leather, 
hairspray, and lace, were really just the same 
as you, and not the freaks you may think us 
to be.

New release fails to meet expectations
By. RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Staffwriter
; Have you ever paid attention to those 
cftgesy summaries on the back of novels? 
Theyre a lot like the press release for 
!Qj.tch Witchs new albumStarvationBox.
Who: Ditch Witch 
What: Starvation Box 
Label: Grass Records
Too much over-inflated language that 
(doesnt say a damn thing about the book 
qM band, in this case). In fact, Ditch 
Witchs press release annoyed me and 
turned me off to the band. All this before 
I .had even heard one note of the album.
,:Bad press releases aside, Ditch Witch 
gives a reasonable effort on this album, 
thgir second. They like you to think 
t^njyve got enough edge in their music to 
sftpar an ewe, but they are softer and 
iftellower than a bulk of the mainstream 
bands. Their style is not very unique, 
which is their major failure in my eyes. 
They sound a lot like the Gin Blossoms 
or any of the other bands that sound a lot 
like the Gin Blossoms.
This generic feel of the album seems
to be due to a heavy-handed production 
style. Starvation Box sounds more like 
a product, designed to be accessible 
(their words) to your average consumer 
Joe, rather 
than an ar
tistic work of 
music. Id be 
interested to 
hear their 
first album, 
to see if this 
is truly Ditch 
Witchs style 
of music, or 
if the album 
is as overpro
duced as itOUUI ICOJ Ul UIOOO F1CWIUO

This album 
is not without its merits. The guitarists 
are obviously fairly skilled and give a 
pleasant down-home feel, making much 
of this album like something youd find 
at a family reunion in Missouri. The 
chord progressions dont seem all that 
inventive or adventurous, but there are 
a lot of little airy notes tweaked in. With 
the feel the guitar gives, theres an en
dearing honesty to the music (not the 
press release) that makes Starvation
Box an appealing album in its own way. 
The lyrics are simple and uncomplicated, 
very clean of pretension, and not par
ticularly moody or brooding.

Rather, it would be more appealing if

this movie comes nowhere near the

Marion High. Upon arriving, he finds 
students outside trying to recreate the 
missing circle of Dantes Inferno. Within 
seconds, not only is his car stolen (after

rally, he is instantly smitten with love, 
and conveniently, so is she. This peace
ful moment is only a brief diversion from 
the surroundings, however, for as he is 
to find out, he has only seen the first of 
Marions horrors. The principal (Louise 
Fletcher) has no faith in the students for 
whom fighting is the norm and learning 
is a foreign idea. The classroom is in 
pieces, having been vacated by the pre
vious teacher being beaten to death. 
From here, a parody ofDangerous Minds 
and Stand and Deliver is interlaced with 
a plot to foil the drug deal that will put 
Griff back behind bars.
Although the script and plot are weak, 
they are executed well by the cast who fit 
perfectly into their roles. Lovitz seems 
to have the lovable loser role down well 
(having even mastered it in animated 
form on The Critic), and Carrere is the 
consummate dream woman who is des
tined to be his. Fletcher is also quite 
good as the principal hell-bent on en
forcing her code of discipline, although 
its not really clear why shes as mean as 
she is.
In addition, the movie is peppered with 
oddities such as various absurd hair styles 
and a pacifier on a chain that serve to 
keep things interesting, even if they are a 
bit overdone. The supporting characters 
include a girl who writes poetry about 
putrid, stinking depression and another 
who is pregnant with her third child and 
brings the first two to class with her. 
These bits of flavor are not enough to save 
High School High, however. The good 
jokes arejusttoofew

you must, rent this 
on video and watch 
it for the bedroom 
scene with the cat.
Dear God receives mediocre review

' Is Dear God a clich? Well, 
lets see. Its a comedy for one. 
Its not the fact that it is a com

make it one.
What: Dear God 
Company:Paramount 
Pictures 
Director: Garry

; You have your quirky charac
ters, the hero thrown in the 
middle of them, and the things 
tkat happen to them while the 
hero is finding himself. Despite 
the unusual plot, a stream of 
fgpiiliarity flows throughout. 
i^Jt has the main character take 
a Turn for the better after soul 
searching. Tom Turner, played 
by Greg Kinnear, is a con artist 
who finally gets whats coming 
to him while trying to make 
some extra cash to pay off his 
gambling debts. He gets the 
choice of either getting a job or 
going to jail. With a little help 
from Cousin Guy, played by 
Timothy Stack, a postal secu
rity guard, Tom finds his way to
the DLO, or the Dead Letter 
Office. This is where all the let
ters go after being character
ized as dead. They have illeg
ible handwriting, no address, 
no return address, and many 
other special categories. Elvis, 
Santa, and God, among them, 
each get filed in separate boxes 
and then packed away.While 
trying to discover a way to ben
efit from this hopeless situa
tion, Tom meets his misfit col
leagues and learns their sto
ries.
After inadvertently sending 
his paycheck to one of the ad
dresses in the God bin, Tom 
finds himself doing a philan
thropic deed which later snow
balls into a court case. It has a 
happy ending. Tom Turner finds 
the ray of goodness inside him
self, gets the girl, and everyone 
is happy.
The first half is actually worth 
watching. The movie moves 
quickly, and it has good charac
ter developments.
There are some funny oneliners and several cameos. Rue 
Mc.Clanahan is Toms blind 
mother, Coolio surprises as her 
nurse maid, John Pinette, a 
stand-up comedian, plays the 
loan shark Junior, and Nancy
Marchand is the judge.
The second half, however, 
drags on for too long. The court 
scene, in which one of the DLO 
members, Laurie Metcalf, from 
Rosanne, returns to her former 
occupation as a lawyer to de
fend Tom Turner, is really 
drawn out, unbelievable, and 
just plain silly. The relation
ship Tom has with a coffee house 
proprietress is sketchy. The 
resolution of most of the char
acters is left out. We are left 
wondering what happens to the 
rest of the crew in the DLO. Do 
they continue to work there? Do 
they all get their own dream 
jobs, or retire?
What is surprising is that 
Garry Marshall directed this 
film mediocrity. Mr. Marshall 
is well known for his memo
rable box office endeavors, such 
as Pretty Woman, Beaches, and 
Overboard.
While I dont recommend see
ing it in the theater, perhaps it 
is worth renting or waiting un
til it comes out on cable.

she tries to marry hastily and un
wisely to escape his stifling grasp.
Benigna Machiavelli, by Charlotte 
Perkins Gilman, is an inspiring, forward-thinking book that tells the 
story of a young woman faced with 
the trials of adulthood, family, and 
the male-oriented workplace. The 
narrator is Benigna MacAvelly, 
whose mission in life is to be a good 
villain, a person who is sneaky and 
underhanded, not for evil but for 
doing good for others. Benigna blos
soms before our eyes to become a 
considerate, industrious, indepen

spite the limitations that her fam
ily, especially her father, present.
As the story progresses through
Benignas adolescence, the veil 
gins to lift from the dysfunctionalism 
of her family that is a result of 
fathers social drinking and 
scending attitude. He 
abuses his wife and his children. 
But Benigna is determined to change 
this. She devises elaborate plans to 
better herself and to better the lives 
of the members of her family.

thinking, and 
idealistic.
There is a. po
tentially inter
esting chapter 
devoted to 
Benignas expe
riences trying to 
work in New 
York City, but in 
my opinion, her 
feminist point of 
view would have 
been more effec
tive if she went 
into more detail concerning sweat
shops and the treatment of women 
by men in the workplace. Instead, 
Gilman glazes over these aspects 
and Benigna quickly returns home 
to assume the position ofloyal daugh
ter and housekeeper in her familys 
boarding house. Gilman has the op
portunity to make a statement and, 
in my opinion, forsakes it for a happy 
ending. 1 
Overall, Benigna Machiavelli is a 
entertaining read, though not quite; 
as informative as I thought after 
reading the forward. Yet, it is al
ways nice to read a story about a 
young woman discovering herself 
her mind and her potential. Sorry 
guys, this is a chick-book!

movies you may have seen 'before....
By JOHN BIGGS
Thursday, October 31
Rosemarys Baby
This movie stars Mia Farrow as a woman who 
skanks and then has a baby. Ill leave it at that, 
because I dont want to ruin it for you. Lets just 
say its a pretty good movie, overall, because 
theres lots of suspense. Therefore, well talk about 
another subject for the remainder of this review.
There are several kinds of ants that may occur in 
and around the home ranging in size from about 
1/32 to 3/4 of an inch long and colored yellowish, 
light brown, reddish-brown, brownish-black or jet 
black. Most are wingless, but the homeowners 
sometimes may confuse winged ants with swarm
ing termites, causing alarm.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am.

Friday, November 1
The Frighteners
Michael J. Fox stars in this scary movie about 
demons and stuff. It also stars Tonya Alvarado. 
Its about psy-kicks who meet clever ghosts. The 
Dragonheart of horror movies, this movie really 
flopped at the B.O., but its a pretty cool movie, 
nonetheless.
Homeowners sometimes complain of literally 
hundreds of tiny ants crawling back and forth in 
a line across their kitchen countertops, feeding on 
jams, jellies, sugar, honey, meats, butter, cheese, 
lard, grease, etc. These substances may have to be 
discarded due to the ant contamination.
At 8 pm, 10 pm, and midnight.

Saturday, November 2
Bob Roberts
Ok, this one is cool. See, it was written and 
directed by Tim Im Not Short. Im a Writer 
Robbins. Its all about a far-right folksinger who 
does some shady deals and in general makes 
himself look good on national television. Slowly 
but surely, he runs for President and gets shot. 
Overall, its a joyous romp through the world of 
right-wing wackos.
Tim Robbins is a cool guy. He not only wrote the 
screenplay but he made a nice quiche that he 
brought to the wrap party. Everyone was very 
excited. It had a delicious and creamy texture.
At 8pm, 10pm, and midnight.

Tomorrows Children
Tomorrows Children is an anti-nazi propoganda 
film about eugenics and babies and stuff. The 
father in this family is all for preventing people 
from having too many babies until his own daugh
ter is about to be killed because the family has one 
too many mouths to feed. I hear its pretty impres
sive, but then I also heard about that time you 
peed on Franks bed.
Ants have a very complex social system. They 
have a series of balls and cotillions that culmi
nates in a promenade through the little ant city. 
Then the ants get married and have babies. Then 
they are killed by Nazis. If Frank hadnt been in 
my room all night complaining about the mess, I 
would have gotten a lot more sleep.
At 8 pm, 10, pm, and midnight.

Album pays tribute to guitarists
By CHARLES FRYMAN
Tartan Junior Staf/writer
No, Elvis didnt write it. The 
50s classic Blue Suede Shoes 
was actually penned by one of the 
most pioneering guitarists of his 
era, Carl Perkins.
songs are the classics that made One of these songs, Give Me lends the use of his guitar, and 
him famous like Blue Suede Back My Job, also features Ringo Starr even sings with 
Shoes and Honey Dont. Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, and Perkins as they perform Cans
The disc contains more than BonoyesBono. But wait! There classic Honey Dont.
Who: Carl Perkins 
What: Go Cat Go 
Label: Dinosaur
Entertainment
Now, 40 years after earning a 
gold record for his most famous 
song, Carl Perkins has collabo
rated with some famous friends 
on a compilation CD entitled Go 
Cat Go. With performances by 
the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Tom 
Petty, and Johnny Cash, Go Cat 
Go puts on a show of varied mu
sical styles.
Carl has been pickin for a liv
ing since the 50s, and he still 
puts out chart toppers today. One 
song included on the album, 
Restless was recently released 
by Mark OConner and the Nash
ville Cats. But Perkinss best
just classics, though. Four 
songs were written just 
this year. Co-written by 
Paul Simon and Perkins, 
Rockabilly Music, is my 
pick for the best on the 
album. Perkinss pickin 
and Simons musical styl
ing are the perfect combi
nation. When the song 
comes to a climax, Carl 
calls out, I got a new pair 
of wing tips; they cost me 
two hundred dollars! It 
may not look like much on 
paper, but theres a whole 
lot of feeling packed into 
those two lines. Its defi
nitely the highlight of the 
album. I say this because 
a lot of the album leaves 
me flat, especially some of 
the slower numbers that are a 
little too country for my taste. 
But for some reason, I enjoyed 
both numbers on which Willie 
Nelson appears.

are more surprise artists! John 
Fogerty joins Perkins on the first 
track, All Mamas Children and 
Paul McCartney sings My Old

The album wouldnt'fe 
complete without at least 
one rendition of Blue 
Suede Shoes, so Go Qgi; 
Go includes two. The ffrst 
is a wicked version by jfre 
Jimi Hendrix Experience, 
complete with a Hendrix 
guitar solo. The second i a' 
version performed by Jon1 
Lennon with Eric Clapton 
on guitar. Neither rendiJ

previous versions nby

This still remains onS'bf 
the best tribute albums Ive' 
ever heard. Its a definite 
must-buy for any big Carl' 
Perkins fan. (Although'4 
dont personally know any 
big Carl Perkins fans, ifm

you need to do is skip a few songs

Sleepers keeps audience awake
By DAN ROSENBERG
Tartan Staffwriter
Does someone who physically, 
emotionally, and sexually abuses 
children deserve to die? Does the 
victim of such abuses have the 
right to kill his or her attacker?

Bros./ Polygram

scared little boys. Their fear 
quickly turns to anger and the 
two men violently execute their 
abuser in the presence of four 
witnesses (one of whom is played 
by the wonderful character ac
tress Aida Turturro).
The remainder of the film fo
cuses on Michaels plan to acquit 
his friends of murder and to cru
cify the other three guards who 
abused them in the process. With 
the help of Shakes, childhood 
friend Carol (Circle of Friends's
These are the related, yet 
independent problems 
posed by Sleepers, the re
markable new film directed 
by Oscarwinner Barry 
Levinson {Rain Man).
The film opens in the sum
mer of 1967, with four 
friends enjoying their pu
bescent years in the Hells 
Kitchen neighborhood of 
New York City. Michael is 
the groups unofficial leader, 
while Lorenzo (nicknamed 
Shakes), John, and 
Tommy are his buddies. Like 
most 13 year old boys, these 
youngsters get into a vari
ety of mischief, including an 
incident in which they sneak 
into the priests compart
ment of the confessional and 
listen to a woman discuss her 
frustration over having an affair 
with a married man.
The boys pranks are played 
mostly for laughs (the aforemen
tioned confessor knew that there 
wasnt a priest behind the screen), 
thereby contrasting sharply with 
an antic that goes tragically awry. 
The lads decide to relocate a hot 
dog cart while the vendor is away 
from his stand. In the process, 
they lose control of the cart and 
nearly kill a man. As a result, the 
boys receive sentences at the 
Wilkinsons Home for Boys, a 
detention facility whose serene 
exterior masks the unspeakable 
horrors that occur inside.
During their one-year stay at 
Wilkinsons, the boys are rou
tinely beaten and sodomized by a 
group of guards ledby SeanNokes 
(menacingly played by Kevin 
Bacon). The abuse scenes are, for 
the most part, implied rather than 
shown, yet the horror of the boys 
ordeal is clearly and unforgetta
bly conveyed.
After the boys are released from 
the detention home, the film 
jumps to 1981. Tommy (Billy 
Crudup) and John (Men Behav
ing Badly'D Ron Eldard), who at 
one time wanted to be priests, are 
now hit men in an Italian gang. 
Michael (Brad Pitt), meanwhile, 
has become a prosecuting attor
ney, and Shakes (Rushs Jason 
Patric) is a budding journalist.
In a bar one evening, Tommy 
and John spot Nokes. This is a 
particularly chilling scene, as we 
see these grown men (and vicious 
killers) revert, for a moment, to

Brad Pitt (Michael) stars in Barry Levinsors Sleepers.
Minnie Driver), and mob boss 
King Benny (superbly played by 
Vittorio Gassman), Michael sets
his plan in motion, perverting 
justice and the morals of a priest 
along the way.
Sleepers is unquestionably one 
of Levinsons best films, and is 
the perfect showcase for the 
directors immense talent. For 
example, in Wilkinsons, the boys 
are often abused in a room in the 
basement of the detention home. 
In lieu of showing the abuse, 
Levinson wisely orchestrates a 
fast-forward track shot down the 
hallway which is accompanied by 
John Williams eerily 
effective score. Later, 
when the grown 
Michael reacquaints 
himself with child
hood girlfriend Carol 
on a subway, we see 
the mans repressedfeelings for her and 
wonder, for a mo
ment, if he will act 
on them. Levinson 
then crafts a fast-for
ward zoom through 
the subway tunnels, 
creating a brilliant 
visual metaphor that 
lets the audience into 
Michaels head. In 
that five second zoom 
down the tunnel, we 
know that Michael 
can never feel roman
tic love because of what occurred 
in the basement of Wilkinsons. If 
this isnt brilliant filmmaking, I
dont know what is.
Levinson isnt the only one \Vfro 
shines in this film. Dusti-ri 
Hoffman is superb in the role-of 
Tommy and Johnnys drug-ad
dicted defense attorney, hire Ay 
King Benny. Joe Perrino, v^Jio 
plays Shakes as a boy, is equally 
wonderful. Robert DeNiro as Re 
boys priest and idol, however, 
takes the films acting laurels. 
When his Father Bobby learns of 
the horrors suffered by the boys 
at the hands of the Wilkinson 
guards, there is an extended cloijeup of DeNiros face. The priests 
anguish is so well-conveyed th&t 
the Best Supporting Actor Os'd&r 
has already been engraved Wiifr 
DeNiros name.
The best part of Sleepers, how
ever-,-is-how the film responds 
the two questions that open this 
review. Father Bobby contem
plates these same question's 
when he is asked to provide'a'rt 
alibi for Tommy and Johnny^It, 
seems as though the film is ah-; 
swering the questions when we" 
learn of the priests decision, 
but this is not the case. Notice 
who isnt present in the filial 
barroom scene, and youll res
ize that perhaps the film isn't 
answering these questions" at 
all. Rather, Sleepers is telling 
the audience to think about 
these issues for themselvfes. 
And, trust me, after seeing thlis 
film, you will be.
