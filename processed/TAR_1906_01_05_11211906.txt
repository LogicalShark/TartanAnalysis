The New Building.Plebes vs. Beaver Falls.Allegheny College vs. Tech.
The new building being erected west 
of the power-house is coming along 
satisfactorily. Last week saw a large 
proportion of the steel framework 
erected, and the bricklayers have a 
good start. This building is perma
nent, but it is only a part of Machin
ery Hall. Provision has been made 
on the side wall columns of the wing 
extending east, for an electric travel
ing crane. This will be of much use 
in handling piles of machinery sent to 
the schools for testing purposes.
The Plebes were defeated by the 
Beaver Falls High School last Satur
day at Beaver Falls, in a game that 
was hotly contested from start to fin
ish. The field wal a regular pool and 
the boys could scarcely be recognized. 
Reisfar, Cassidy and D. Patterson 
played a star game for the Plebes and 
Rodgers did well for High School.

As it is planned, the part under con

The kitchen and dining room will

school in the day courses. At the 
present stage of affairs, Butchers

Did you notice that every time any
thing goes wrong with the arc lamps 
in the Maggie Murphy department, 
Slocum and Hunt are on the spot to 
remedy the trouble?
Tech defeated Allegheny College at 
Meadville last Saturday on a field that 
was a veritable quagmire, and at times 
it was hard for both teams to know 
their own men. The score of 50 
does not indicate the character of the 
fast play by the Carnegie men, and had 
it been a dry field there is no doubt 
but that the score would have been 
trebled.
At two oclock Referee Gordon call
ed Captains Grim and Foster to the 
center of the field. Twenty-minute 
halves were decided upon, Capt. Fos
ter won toss and chose to defend the 
west goal. Stockton kicked off to 
Techs 15-yard line and received by 
Dowling, who carried the ball back 12 
yards and was downed. Dowling was 
sent around left end and netted first 
down for Tech. On the next play 
Ramp was given the ball for a smash 
through Alleghenys right guard for 
another ten yards. A run inside end 
by Urling gave Tech seven yards more. 
A forward pass to Charles advanced 
the ball nine yards more. Urling 
made first down. Dowling got away 
on the next, play for a long run, which 
brought the spectators to their feet, 
for a touchdown seemed imminent, but 
the character of the ground was such 
that he slipped when within a few' 
yards of Alleghenys goal and was 
held by Stuart. Ramp began a series 
of hard line plunges, which gained 
ground for Tech every time. Dowling 
was given the ball and fumbled, the 
ball being recovered by an Allegheny 
man. Allegheny tried Techs ends 
without success and then kicked to 
Schaub on Alleghenys fifty-yard line. 
Shaub run the ball back ten yards and 
was downed. Pone Urling made a 
brilliant 20-yard run. Dowling netted 
five more. Ramp smashed through 
the center for five yards and then an
other plunge through tackle wdiich 
landed the pigskin within a foot of 
Alleghenys goal. Grafton wras sent 
over for a touchdown. Foster kicked 
out to Shaub, who healed it on the 
25-yard line. Henderson made a good 
attempt at a goal but failed by a 
hair, the ball striking the cross-bar.
Allegheny kicked off to Carnegies 
30-vard line and received by Grafton, 
who carried the ball back 10 yards. 
By rapid fire line plunges and bril
liant end runs the ball was carried to 
within 10 yards of Allegheny's goal, 
when time was called.
The second half opened with Tech 
kicking to Alleghenys 10-yard line,

Allegheny College vs. Tech.
(Continued from page 1.) 
Benedict received the ball and ad
vanced it 12 yards, downed by Beelten. 
At this point the Meadville boys took 
a brace and made some good gains, 
carrying the ball for 40 yards, landing 
it in the center of the field. Tech 
held at this point and started down the 
field again, Ramp, Urling and Dowling 
making successive gains. Urling 
tried an onside kick, which was re
covered by Stuart and downed by 
Beeken. By tacklebacks Allegheny 
netted first down. A plunge through 
guard netted another five yards and 
then a forward pass was tried which 
was successfully blocked by Urling 
and Charles secured the ball. Tech 
tried the ends for two first downs and 
then a forward pass to Charles was 
blocked and Allegheny secured the 
ball on her own 30-yard line. A try 
at Techs line was unsuccessful and 
after two tries at the end, the ball 
went to Tech. Tech rushed the ball 
to Alleghenys 10-yard line. Time

The set of storage batteries in the 
Electrical Laboratory, consisting of 
sixty thirty ampere cells connected in 
series giving an e. m. f. of 120 volts, 
was filled and given its initial charge
last Friday and Saturday. Owing to 
the necessity making this charge con
tinuous the small engine in the power
house was run all night to furnish 
power for the motor-generators in the 
laboratory. The opportunity was 
taken to study the behaviour of a bat
tery on its initial charge and a com
plete set of i5-minute readings was 
taken. The work was done by the 
students as part of their regular la
boratory practice. The storage bat
tery is to be used in connection with 
the experimental work in the labor

It is' appropriate that this issue of 
the Tartan, in which appears the 
newly elected Tartan Staff, should 
contain a brief synopsis of just what 
the Tartan stands for, in its relation 
to the student body and to the Faculty. 
Everyone can easily recognize the dif
ficulties dependent upon the starting 
of the paper, and realize how wholly 
the success or failure of the venture 
depends upon the student support in 
every way.
All college or school publications are 
run upon one of two methods. First, 
as a private venture, as in many of 
our larger colleges; second, promoted 
by the student body. In either case, 
the responsibility of its financial suc
cess depends upon its originators. 
The Tartan is a combination of the 
two; it was started by two students, 
who shouldered the responsibility of 
the paper, with the end in vjew of 
paying, in part at least, their ex
penses through school; and upon 
graduation, to turn over the paper 
with its accompanying good-will of the 
schools, and established standing with 
the advertisers, to the student body. 
We aim at as high a standard, if not 
higher, than most publications of a 
like sort; and to do this we are trying 
to get together a staff which is not 
afraid to work, for that is exactly 
what it all amounts to.
After careful consideration, it was 
decided that a man or girl should be 
in the schools at least a year before 
being eligible to a position in the 
editorial or managerial departments, 
thus making it purely competitve, as 
in all other school papers. All firstyear students must look at this de
cision in the broader light, in view of 
the fact that they will soon be in their 
second year, and will then be glad of 
the precedent we are establishing.
Another tradition that we have 
started in order that the first year
students be fairly represented, is that 
the Presidents of the several incom
ing classes elect one of their number 
as the Tartan correspondent from 
that class. This correspondents copy 
will be given just as much considera
tion and be put in as prominent a 
place, as any of the matter turned in 
by the associate editors.
Before the end of each school year 
those first-year students whose work 
on the paper has been most satisfac
tory in every way, will be invited to 
the annual staff banquet, at which 
their formal appointment will be an
nounced.
In conclusion, we wish to thank the 
students in all the departments, and 
both the members of the Faculty and 
of the executive staff, for their recep
tion of the Tartan; and we hope the 
paper will grow as the school is grow
ing, to be something dear to the heart 
of every student of the Carnegie Tech
nical Schools.

1910
Oh When!
Oh When!
1910!
It is rather unfortunate that the 
second year men have so little time 
after school to hold meetings of any 
kind for advancing and encouraging 
Class spirit. The light in the building 
are turned off at 11 oclock, and it is 
close to that time when the different 
sections are dismissed. On the other 
hand, by reason of the lateness of the 
hour most of the men are in a hurry 
to get home.
The plan of holding meetings be
fore classes begin was tried but proved 
a failure for various reasons.
An idea was suggested to the effect 
that the third or last hour on the first 
school night of each month, be given 
the second year men to hold a class 
meeting, and the studies assigned for 
this period be dropped on that night, 
but men not attending the meeting be 
recorded as absent from class.
This plan seems practical and would 
insure a large attendance at the meet
ings. Let us hope that the Director 
will be in favor of this plan and give 
it his approval.
Prof. Hokansen is certainly a 
stayer. Classes C and D very 
rarely leave the class room on Wed
nesday nights until a few minutes 
before the lights are turned off.
The boys in both classes are very 
much interested in the subject of 
Graphic Statics which Prof. Hokansen teaches, and from the appear
ance of the papers turned in, it is 
evident that the method of his teach
ing is clearly understood.
The subject of basket-ball has come 
to the front, and questions are asked 
will we have a team? and where 
can we practice?
Efforts were made last year to per
fect a team on the taught-by-mail 
principle, but as was to be expected, 
the team was not so developed as a 
Carnegie Tech team should be. 
The night men were the only ones to 
show any kind of spirit for such sport, 
although when a game was arranged 
with a first-class team the athletes 
in the day school became interested 
and helped out. We were beaten but 
put up a good game, and won warm 
words of praise for our gameness. 
The Athletic Association should get 
busy and endeavor to provide a hall for 
practice and no doubt good teams 
could be brought out of both day and 
night classes.
In the last issue of the Tartan 
something was said about arranging a 
smoker. Every student that was 
here last year remembers what a 
large success the smoker given by the 
night students in Applied Science was, 
and it is not out of place to say that 
the affair could be duplicated. Here 
is a good chance for 1911 to make 
themselves known.
Why is class 2-C always so warm? 
Because they have Summer(s) all 
term.
Lautenschlaeger got mixed up with 
a short-circuit in electricity the other 
evening and Prof. Wurts had some 
difficulty in getting him untangled.
Prof. Willett was asked the reason 
why the majority of Italian immi
grants take to keeping fruit stands. 
Any one know?
What has become of the famous 
Q class of last year? was asked re
cently. Why the members have been 
distributed among other classes in the 
'hope that their brightness and vast 
knowledge would become contagious.
J. H. Taxis, of class 2-C, has been 
appointed chief reporter of the night 
classes for the Tartan by President 
Sheehan.
He has appointed the following as 
his assistants:
W. O. Brosius, Class 2-A.
R. K. Culbertson, Class 2-B.
J. W. Considine, Class 2-D.
News of all kinds concerning the 
second year night classes will be a 
regular feature of the Tartan.
1910 are getting ready for a dance, 
a banquet, a smoker and other good 
times generally that will earn for 
them the reputation of being the 
biggest entertainers, hustlers and 
and all-around good fellows.
-----------o-----------1911
On Wednesday evening, Nov. 14, 
1900, the class of 1911 held a meeting 
for the purpose of discussing the re
port submitted by the constitution 
committee, appointed recently by

President Harley. The constitution 
offered by said committee was adopted 
with but a few minor changes, and if 
we may take the word of any 1911 
man it certainly must be a good one. 
A discussion was indulged in with ref
erence to the adoption of class colors 
and a motto. In the matter of the 
former, blue and white were the col
ors chosen, but the latter has been 
held over for subsequent consider
ation.
The regular committees, as called 
for in the new constituton were ap
pointed. They are three in number 
and are called respectively, social, 
athletic and auditing.
On the social committee, President 
Harley appointed the following gen
tlemen: Mr. Hess, Mr. A. F. Stamm,
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Morgan and Mr. Miller.
By special provision of the constitu
tion the secretary of the class is the 
chairman of the social committee. 
Since Mr. Hess holds the secretary
ship he is the chairman. The com
mittee has begun operations, notice 
of which will appear in another cob 
umn of this issue.
The members appointed to serve on 
the athletic commttee were the 
Messrs.* Morrison, Farrel, McCully, 
Flinn and Newell.
The auditing committee will be ap
pointed later, as a motion to adjourn 
was made and carried before all the 
business was completed.
In last weeks issue there appeared 
a challenge from the class of 1911 to 
the class of 1910 to decide the foot
ball supremacy of the night classes 
of the School of Applied Science.
Mr. Morrison, chairman of the ath
letic committee of 1911, would be
pleased to meet any representatives 
of 1910 to make plans and arrange
ments for the game.
In the event of 1910 not being in a 
positon to accept the challenge, Mr. 
Morrison would like to be so advised 
in order that another attraction may 
be booked for Thanksgiving Day.
It has leaked out that Hess and 
Edwards intend to line-up with 1911 
for the inter-class game. Both these 
men are fine specimens of rugged 
manhood, and it was the intention to 
spring a surprise on 1910 by playing 
them. Hess is a good line man, while 
Edwards is a star half-back. Both 
are experienced men and in good 
condition.

Dr. R. H. Holbrook has accepted the 
office of Advisor in the organization 
known as the Class of 1911. As Dr. 
Holbrook is an authority on Parlia
mentary Practice, the meetings will 
be, without doubt, models in that re
spect.
One of the gems found in the con
stitution of the Class of 1911: The
object of this organization is to pro
mote sociability among the members 
and to foster loyalty to the class and 
to the school. That sounds good, 
eh?
C. E. Morrison, chairman of the 
athletic committee, is going to encour
age the men to come out for athletics 
by setting a good example. He has 
brought a foot-ball to school for prac
tice for the great inter-class game on 
Thanksgiving. He is himself a good 
player and will no doubt make good 
with the team.
Heard in G-lWhy, Professor, how 
can you get the stress per square-inch 
of sectional area when the bar is only 
three-fourths dia.
1911 has quite a poetic marshall as 
well as a handsome one.
Owing to the large number of stu
dents enrolled in the Class of 1911, 
and also to the many sections, a man 
from each section has been appointed 
to assist Mr. Stamm, the Tartan rep
resentative. The following gentlemen 
will represent their respective sec
tions: Mr. W. D. Eardlev, C. L. T. 
Edwards, T. A. Tate, B. V. Dinsmore 
and Mr. Lonergan.
Just a word with reference to send
ing in any contribution to the Tartan. 
Let no one get the idea that only reg
ularly appointed reporters have the 
privilege of writing for the Tartan. 
Such is not the case, for every student 
enrolled in Carnegie Tech Schools, ir
respective of class or department, age 
or sex, is a reporter, and it is not only

THE SLIDE RULEWITH EXERCISES FOR BEGINNERS.
(Part I published in last weeks number contained a description of the 
Slide Rule, with exercises in reading the graduations and exercises in multi
plication.)
DIVISION.Can be done on the upper scales or on the lower, both with
equal facility. The operation consists of subtracting the logarithm of the
divisor from the logarithm of the dividend.
The subtraction is performed mechanically as shown in Fig 7 so that 
the user does not think about the logarithms themselves. Two examples 
are shown in Fig. 7, first 1.65 divided by 1.31 giving a quotient 1,259, and 
second 66 divided by 74 giving a quotient .893. In either case there are 
three operations, (a) Put runner at the dividend on the stock, (b) Move 
the slide until the divisor coincides with the runner, (c) Find the result
under 1 of the slide (either end.) In the first example of Fig 7
Quotient I2S9 Dividend US Divisor 74-
Divisor 1.31Dividend 66 
Fig. 7
Quotient .893
the result is found under the left end of the slide, in the second example 
the result is found under the right end. In the second case the log. of the 
quotient is obtained by adding the arithmetic complement of the logarithm 
of the divisor to the logarithm of the dividend.

Notes on Exercise 5. (a) The number 8 occurs twice on scale A, and
the divisor 2 occurs twice on scale B. It makes no difference which is 
taken, for the same result is obtained, (b) The decimal point is found by 
inspection, (c) The number n is given a special line on scale B. (d) The 
slide projects to the right, nearly out of its groove. Using the A.B. scales this 
can be avoided, (e) The number n is not usually marked on the lower scales, 
so it must be read from its value 3.141. Time of working these examples 
by the slide rule is about 5 minutes.
SUCCESSIVE DIVISION. AVhen one number is divided by a product of 
several factors the result is obtained by a series of divisions. The runner 
is needed to keep the place, so that only the final result has to be read off 
the scale. As an example take
162
------------------------------------- .00204
29 X 38 X 72
Using the A. B. scale the steps on the slide rule are: (1) Move the 
runner to 162 on A scale. (2) Set 29 on B scale to the runner. (3) Move 
runner to 1 on B. (4) Set 38 on B to the runner. (5) Move runner to 1 on 
B. (6) Set 72 on B to the runner. (7) Over 1 find 204, which is seen by 
inspection to be .00204, the result.
The same operations are compactly indicated in the following diagram.

Owing to our energetic teacher, 
Mrs. Johnston, we have not only 
completed a number of buckram 
frames, bands, and rosettes, but have 
also completed a number of hats. 
We have at present fifteen girls in our 
class and it would be putting it mildly 
to say that we are all interested, es
pecially as the work advances. Sev
eral of our girls are wearing stunning 
models that have been designed and 
made in our class and have been much 
admired. We are looking forward to 
an idea which Mrs. Johnston has sug
gested to us, and if we are able to 
carry it out we will publish it later.

Notes on Exercise 6. (1) When the runner is moved to 1 for the first
time, the result is 647 divided by 2.3: when moved to 1 for the second time
the result is 647 divided by (2.3 X 2.1): when moved to 1 for the third time 
the final result 233' is read off. The decimal point is found by inspection.
(5) Place 785 on slide at 1 on the stock. Take the mark 1 that is most
convenient, either right or left.
This exercise can be worked on the slide rule in 5 minutes.
MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION. Are combined in making calcula
tions like the following, where the numerator and denominator both consist 
of several factors.
6.2 X 3.4 X 11.1
------------------------------------------ 3.25
2.7 X 7.61 X 3.5
One way is to multiply the factors of numerator and denominator sepa
rately. A better way is to combine the multiplication and division as shown 
in the following diagram, using the A. B. scales.(1) (3) (5)

The numbers (1), (2), (3), etc., indicate the order of the various steps.

Notes on Exercise 7. (1) As a check repeat the operation with the factors
in a different order, as 240 divided by 28 then multiply by 7.7 and divide by
1.4. (2) The result in this case will fall above 5.2, for this will be the
last factor used. - The time of working this exercise is 5 minutes.

On Tuesday of last week the class 
enjoyed the privilege of hearing a de
lightful lecture on Egypt by Miss 
Smith. Fine lantern slides from pho
tographs and diagrams of the sphinx, 
the exterior and interior of the pyra
mids, Egyptian tombs, views of Cairo, 
and several other attractive Egyptian 
scenes in addition to Miss Smiths 
word descriptions, made the lecture 
especially interesting and instructive.
At a special class meeting on Thurs
day morning, the main business was a 
discussion of the basket-ball situation, 
and opinion on the advisability of 
having a team was about equally di
vided. Some of the girls held that 
our Assembly hall, the only possibly 
suitable room for practice, could 
easily be fittted up with baskets, the 
windows and lights screened at slight 
expense, and a team could be organ
ized at once, while the opposition de
clared that first of all the assembly 
room was not regulation size, and if 
the girls did practice they would not 
be able to play outside teams for this 
reason. In addition, the room was in
convenient because of the other pur
poses for which it was used, and inter
est would soon flag when the girls 
had to clear out desk and chairs be
fore every practice day. The matter 
was laid on the table until the next 
regular meeting.
