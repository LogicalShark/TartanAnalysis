Building Plans 
Well Advanced 
Over Campus
Groundbreaking Of IA 
To Begin In August; 
Industries Renovated
Progress is the byword in tfye 
building program at Carnegie. 
Through a long range program, all 
the buildings will be rehibilitated. 
New construction and improve
ments will eventually eliminate 
the need for temporary buildings.
Some of the plans have already 
crystallized and are now in effect. 
During the summer more recon
struction is expected to get un
derway.
Morewood will probably see the 
end of construction around the 
first part of July. Then begins 
the job of decorating and finish
ing to provide the best for the 
dorm women and their friends.
New IA Building
The Industrial Administration 
building wijl begin with ground
breaking ceremonies around Au
gust, and the completion date ten
tatively set at September, 1951. 
At present, the layout is fairly 
clear, and the architects are 
working out the details.
Engineerings new wing is near
ing completion despite many set
back. The strike last summer 
.delayed progress for over three 
months. It is hoped that the sec
tion will be completed by next 
September for Occupancy by the 
Chem Es and chemists.
In the older part of EH more 
renovation has been going on, 
particularly in the physics de
partment. More rebuilding is ex
pected to get underway.
New Lighting Panel
In Fine Arts, the focal point is 
the Little Theatre. This summer 
a new lighting control panel will 
be installed. Electronically oper
ated, it will be the third one of 
its type in the country.
Industries Hall is the scene of 
much improvement, past, pres
ent, and prospective. This year 
the civil wing and the 240 and 
340 wings have been completed. 
The 240 wing is the new home 
for the Bureau of Placements 
and ROTC offices while 340 pro
vides room for many Soc. Rel. 
classes.
Now in the process of renova
tion are the public relations and 
alumni offices. During the sum
mer the provosts office and the 
printing department will be ren
ovated. A small section of print
ing has already been completed, 
indicating the trend of things tq 
come.
Scientific Colors
Even the colors of the class
room walls are undergoing im
provement. Buff is being sup
planted by brighter and newer 
shades. True to technical stand
ards, the new hues are chosen sci
entifically. Color experts from

Senior Ball
The Senior Dance will be 
held at the Schenley Hotel on 
Tuesday, June 13, from 9:30 
to 12. It is an informal, and 
tickets will be $2.00.
Tickets will go on sale on 
Monday, May 22, and can be 
purchased from 9 until 10 and 
from 1 until 2 in the Regis
trars office and in the Dean 
of Mens office at any time. 
Invitations to graduation can 
be secured in the Registrars 
office during the above hours.
All seniors who do not plan 
to use their three tickets to 
C ommencement are requested 
to turn them in to the Regis
trars office or the department 
of public relations.
Editorial
Dr. Doherty: A Summing Up
Perhaps in the rush of year-end activities and crises a 
rather significant event will not be noted by most Carnegie 
students. Dr. Robert E. Doherty, probably the most contro
versial figure connected with the school since its founding, 
with the possible exception of Andrew  Carnegie himself, 
vacates the office of President on July 1.
To deny that many people have found shortcomings in 
his administration, that many people have disagreed, vio
lently, with his policies and actions, would be blindness. 
Yet an appraisal, from the student point of view, of what he 
has done in his 14 years at Carnegie, seems more in danger 
of undervaluing his achievements and contributions than of 
over-emphasizing them.
There are many today who, perhaps justifiably, still 
quarrel with the shift in emphasis in the athletic program 
which he initiated and carried out. His stand, that football 
players must be students in the full sense of the word, has ; 
not been a popular one. But he cannot be accused of selling 
Carnegie students, athletically, down the river. For exam
ple, the intramural sports program has been developed almost 
from scratch during his administration. It may be that Dr. i 
Doherty will someday be recognized as the leader in discov
ering a middle ground between semi-professional college 
sports and the Hutchins-University of Chicago extreme.
Doesnt Mix With The Students
Another charge leveled at Dr. Doherty has been that 
he has never associated freely with the students or partici
pated in their affairs. This charge may have been quite 
valid prior to this year. In his defense a strong case can be 
made out that a college presidents division of his work will 
always leave some critical things undone. Dr. Doherty de
voted himself to those tasks he thought needed his atten
tion most. Many of us have taken note, within the past year, 
of such items as his leading the football victory parade, his 
cheerleading on the Cut, and his participation in the Home
coming pageantry, all of which seemed to denote a change 
in his attitude. But isnt it possible that these actions on 
his part were largely a reflection of a friendlier, warmer 
attitude on the part of the students and might have come 
about long ago had something been done to bring the stu
dents and the President together?
When we evaluate the above gripes (and we are aware 
of their validity) would it not be apropos to consider the 
larger endeavour of which they might have been the shaggy 
ends. Perhaps values attained elsewhere more than offset 
these shortcomings. We think that this question is worthy 
of inquiry.
The Other Side of The Picture
Let us find out then, what Dr. Doherty has done that is 
deserving of our attention.
We are all aware of the Carnegie Plan, and the more 
fortunate of us have seen it in action in its best-developed 
form. To those who have, we neednt explain its uniqueness 
and value. Those who have seen the Plan in its exploratory 
and intermediate stages may wince at its mention, but grow
ing pains must be expected. Nevertheless its validity is being 
more firmly established every day, and with the outpourings 
of students who are each year better trained in its methods 
it will become more so. Dr. Doherty has advanced Carnegie 
Tech to the position of one of the most technically-proficient 
and socially-consciolis professional institutions in the nation.
What Else Has He Done?
Yet the establishment of a wholly new academic philo
sophy has not been the sole accomplishment of Dr. Dohertys 
tenure. A critically important, though easily overlooked job 
which he has done is that of raising vast sums of money, for 
the endowment, for the expansion and improvement activity 
evident all around us, and for carrying out the educational 
programs.
To adequately list the problems he has recognized and 
attacked, the advances he has made, would more than ex
haust all the space available here. He has not sought credit 
and recognition for his accomplishments, despite the fact 
that he, perhaps more than any other single individual, has 
set the tenor and created the value of the education we are 
receiving today, an education which many of us believe is 
second to none.
This is not intended to be a eulogy. It is an attempt to 
bring into better focus a picture which students too seldom 
are enabled to see clearly. Seeing this picture, we are sure 
that, as he now retires, they would say: Dr. Doherty, we 
commend you on a great and difficult job well done, we 
salute you for the educational program you have made posJ sible for us, and we wish you many happy years to come.

Professorship 
Is Established 
By Gulf Oil
A new professorship in chem
istry has been established at CIT 
through a grant by the Gulf Oil 
Corporation, according to a joint 
announcement today by Presi
dent Doherty and Gulf President 
Sidney A. Swensrud.
The new chair, supported by a 
grant of $15,000 per year, will be 
held by Dr. Frederick D, Ros
sini, currently chief of the thermo
chemistry and hydrocarbons sec
tion of the Bureau of Standards 
and recently appointed head of 
Carnegies chemistry department.
Dr. Rossini, who is a Carnegie 
alumnus, will join the faculty on 
July 1.
In the announcement, President 
Doherty said that the new chair 
will be named for Benjamin Silliman, who was one of the countrys 
most distinguished scientists dur
ing the 1800s and a pioneer in 
the chemistry of petroleum refin
ing.
Both the holder of the new pro

announcement was made 
the following provisions, 
which take into account the sug
gestions made by several student 
groups:
1) A freshman may move from 
the dormitory to a fraternity 
house at the beginning of the 
second semester. In this connec
tion, it is expected that some upperclass fraternity men. now liv
ing in the dormitories, will move 
into their respective houses, at 
least during the first semester, in 
order to occupy those spaces that 
were frequently filled in the past 
by freshman pledges.
It is recognized that a few of 
the larger fraternities may ex
perience some difficulty at the 
start in filling their houses to ca
pacity, but it is expected that 
this matter will be taken into 
consideration in the fraternities 
financial relationships with the 
institution, if such relationships 
exist.

made by the special committee of 
the Mens Dormitory Council, ca

purpose, with not more than
10 percent allocated to any

3) The decreased cost per man 
resulting from the increased pop

reflected in the decreased rates 
of the rooms affected.
4) Upperclass assignments to 
dormitory rooms will be made 
according to the existing priority 
plan after the freshman rooms 
have been designated. In order 
to promote better orientation and 
to make rooms at varying rates 
available to all classes, freshmen 
will be assigned to all dormitories.

Editorial
Time For Action
The time has never been better for a clearer 
and more definite interpretation of eligibility 
rules as they regard anything from playing foot
ball to pushing a buggy in the Carnival sweep
stakes.
Duringthe past year, the very high competition 
existing among campus organizations has Jed to 
several disputes over the questionable eligibility 
of men on probation to take part in activities of 
their respective organization. The situation has led 
to some embarassing moments for the Dean of 
Men, whose only power in the matter is. to in
terpret the White Book regulations as they con
cern the students, not to change a rule for the 
convenience of any one organization. '
On the other hand, the organizations  mostly 
fraternities  who have tried to evade the effects 
of probationary actions as taken by the college 
councils, counter with the defense that there never 
has been a clearly defined line as to what the 
White Book means when it refers to extra-cur
ricular activities. Whether it should stand for just 
all-student activities, or for organizational par
ticipation in intramurals, or for Spring Carnival 
or Homecoming participation has never been an
swered.
And unless the interested organizations make } 
the first step, confusion will exist in future years. 
Whether it be by Council of Fraternity Presidents 
or by Dorm Council, or both in conjunction, the | 
administration should be petitioned to enforce 
rigid eligibility rules on those activities which ! 
are considered to be extra-curricular, and which ' 
endanger the scholastic standing of a student on ( 
probation.
We suggest that such a petition contain a list 
of recommended activities that should not fall 
under eligibility regulation. Certainly Homecoming 
and Spring Carnival participation cannot be con
sidered as extra-curricular in the true sense of 
the word.
It may be well, also, to consider whether the 
ban on intramural participation for students on 
probation is not too serious. One of the purposes 
of maintaining an intramural program is to proj 
vide relaxation and exercise for the student body. 
By penalizing the low-factor man in not per
mitting him to compete in any intramural sports, j 
the school is cutting out an important part of 
the students curriculum.
Those activities which actually consume enough 
of the individuals time so that his scholarship 
is directly influenced should certainly include 
intercollegiate athletics, publication work, office j 
in organizations such as Dorm Council, fraternities, ! 
etc., and other activities which have an all-school 
nature and which last for an entire semester or j 
year.
The Council of Fraternity Presidents has al
ready started action on the problem, a committee 
having been set up at the last meeting to study 
the situation. It is hoped now that CFP will follow 
through on this project until a logical conclusion 
is reached. While the problem of drawing a 
finer line between activities is not a simple one, 
any progress made in the direction of clarifying 
the White Book ruling will be' a step toward 
more amiable relations among competitive or
ganizations on campus.

DONT THROW AWAY THE KEY!
Letter To The Editor
Council Coverage 
Seems Inadequate
It is my belief that one of the purposes of a 
campus newspaper is to further worthwhile stu
dent activities and organizations. The Tartan 
has done a good job in pushing intramural and 
inter-collegiate athletics; in giving publicity to 
such events as homecoming, Spring Carnival, and 
the class elections and in keeping the student 
body informed on the activities of various other 
campu organizations.
But I feel that the Tartans apparent attitude 
toward Student Council is destructive rather than 
constructive. The rather constant belittling of 
councils activities may have been justified in 
some cases, but it has done no good for the Tar
tan, for Council, or for the school in general.
Last weeks article on council stressed the 
fact that only 20 minutes were taken to appro
priate $14,200 to the various campus organiza
tions. Add to this the two and a half weeks 
spent by budget chairman Zuch in investigat
ing and going over the budgets in detail, plus 
his constant supervision of the organizations 
finances throughout the year, and we get a better 
perspective on the matter.
It is unfortunate that three times during the 
past semester council found itself without a 
quorum, once for the full meeting, twice for ap
proximately half the meeting. But it hardly 
seems to justify the sarcastic opening para
graphs in the May 10 and 16 Tartans, which in
cluded such comments as, quorum-starved Stu
dent Council and The 13 other Councilmen 
apparently put their interests above those of 
their constituents and stayed far enough away 
from th Union so that the quorum of 20 could 
not be mustered.
The last year has seen a great improvement 
in the amount of constructive work done by 
Council. The parking situation, all-school dance 
problem, class organizations, Al Minetti PA Sys
tem, and a new set of rules for freshman orien
tation are some of the projects undertaken by 
Student Council or its committees. It is the hope 
of Council members that the Tartan can con
tinue not only to make these projects known to 
the student body, but also to assist creatively in 
| carrying them out.
Charles Koester, 
Past President 
Student Council!
(Ed. noteThe Tartan openly apologizes for 
the erroneous information it presented in its last 
issue in the Student Council story. The fact that 
the budget was so well prepared that it did not 
require extensive time to obtain the approval of 
Council members was commendable htdeed.J
Stanley R. March 
Named Director 
Of Carnegie Press
Stanley R. March has been 
named director of the Carnegie 
Press, publishing division of 
Carnegie Tech, President Doherty 
announced recently.
Mr. March, who is also director 
of public relations, was formerly 
executive secretary of the book 
publication committee, adminis
trative board of the Press.
In the title change announced 
today, Mr. March will be secre
tary of the committee as well as 
director of the Press.
Currently being published un
der the Carnegie imprint are two 
new books scheduled for publica
tion this summer and fall. They 
are Russias Educational Her
itage, by William H. E. Johnson, 
and Printing Types and How to 
Use Them, by Stanley C. 
Hlasta.
Both authors are members of 
the Carnegie faculty.
Eta Kappa Nu 
Elects Officers 
For 1950-51
The annual election of officers 
for CIT's chapter of Eta Kappa 
Nu, national alectrical engineer
ing honorary, was conducted after 
a dinner meeting on Wednesday, 
May 3. The new officers for the 
1950-51 school year are as follows: 
Richard C. Lyman, president; Ce' cil J. Minor, vice-president and 
| bridge correspondent; Frank G. 
Primozich, corresponding secre
tary; David H. Geipel, recording 
secretary, Donald A. Burt, treas
urer; and Russel C. McWhinney, 
night school vice-president.
The executive board has met 
to appoint committeemen and to 
plan the next semesters program, 
which will include continuation 
of the tutoring program in coop
eration with Tau Beta Pi. Other 
plans are underway to improve 
inter-student and rtudent-instructor relations in the electrical de
partment.
Thistles
Those who have paid for 
their Thistles must pick them 
up before leaving school for 
the summer. In the event that 
this becomes impossible, the 
staff will undertake to mail 
them if postage is supplied by 
the purchaser. If the Thistle 
remains unclaimed tor a per
iod of one year from the de
livery date, the staff cannot 
be held responsible for deliv
ery.
CRITICS ON DRAMA . . . One of
the top drama critics of the coun
try, Brooks Atkinson of the New 
York Times, saw The Skin of 
Our Teeth, the current drama 
department production and had 
nothing but praise for the 'show, 
i He said that the play was fit for 
1 a professional road show.
ONCE AGAIN, PLEASE . . . 
Brooks Atkinson also reviewed in 
the New York Times the Pitts
burgh Playhouse production, 
Fifty Grand, which was written 
by two Carnegie graduates, Dave 
Crantz and Kenny Welsh. Again, 
the critic praised the play. Tony 
Antin, public relations, comment
ed, All in all, he thinks were 
hot.
THE DEAN IS ON HER TOES
. . . Dean Campbell was a missing 
guest at the Spring Carnival 
dances. The Dean of Women 
broke her toe the Friday of Spring 
Carnival and was forced to fore
go the festivities.
SPEAKING OF DEANS . . . As
sistant Dean of Men, Ben David, 
is driving the post office crazy. 
He is receiving mail addressed: 
Mr. Ben David, Schenley Park. 
Dean David laughed, The post
man just knocks on the tree three 
times.
FOR POSTERITY . . . Behind the 
stage of the Fine Arts theatre, 
painted on the columns and the 
walls, are names preserved for 
posterity. Since the early 1900's 
all the stage crews have written 
their names on the walls of the 
inter-green roomas this back 
stage room is called. A fascinat
ing collection of names.
SPRING AND DE POSIES . . . 
The administration offices have 
been in full bloom lately. Several 
times a week^ one of the garden
ers brings flowers to the offices. 
Wonder where he finds the Pow
ers? Phipps' Conservatory, may
be?
RINGS . . . The CIT degree, the 
official, emblem of alumni who 
have earned a degree, was adopted 
in 1922. The pattern on the shank 
of the ring is a thistle; the setting 
is an amethyst; and the bezel 
around the setting carries the 
name of +he institution.
UNION PEOPLE . . . Carnegie 
Union is a bee-hive of activity. 
Last year, between 29,000 and 
30,000 people used the Union fa
cilities, according to Mrs. Hagans. 
SAUCERS OVER MOREWOOD 
... A Margaet Morrison junior, 
Diane McFarland, claims there 
really are flying saucers. She and 
several other girls swore that one 
rainy night, an object trailing a 
green vapor zoomed across the 
skies near Morbwood Gardens. 
TECH IN BLOOM . . . The campus 
is coming into full bloom at last. 
That digging by Machinery Hall 
is the beginning of a new walk 
and flower garden.
TALL JOHNS AND JANES . . . 
There are all kinds of organiza
tions, but the one that takes the 
cake is the Star Dusters, a club 
for tall people of the Tri-State 
area. This group is launching its 
membership drive with an open 
dance at Syria Mosque on May 27 
featuring Lee Kiltons orchestra. 
To become a member, a gill must 
be a't least 5 feet 10 inches, and a 
boy, 6 foot 2.
SLAP-HAPPY NEW YEAR . . .
A mechanical engineer, Jim Flem
ing, painted the sign written in 
Chinese that hangs on the wall in 
| the Dean of Womens office. The 
j sign is supposed to read, It is 
later than you think. But the 
Chinese who wrote the symbols for 
Jim thought it would be more 
interesting to mak^ it say, Happy 
New Year. And that is exactly 
what that sign does say! 
CARNIVAL REMEMBRANCE . . . 
Hap Hazard, Spring Carnival dec
oration committeeman, did a fine 
sketch of Charlie Chaplin which 
Ted Goodson, Carnival head, is 
keeping as a souvenir. All those 
who worked on Carnival have 
autographed the sketch. That is 
a souvenir really worth keeping.

Maybe, Say Students
For years, some students have expressed a desire to have CIT 
play class A football teams as it did in the good old days. When 
Nebraska University extended an invitation that Carnegie include 
them in the football schedule next year, the desire seemed to be
reaching fulfillment. Nov that this< 
proposal has been declined, the in
quiring reporter wondered what 
the students think. Should CIT 
play such class A te^ms as Nebras
ka?
Bill Hiatt, graduate student:
Every team 
must play 
games out of its 
class some
times. By doing 
this, the foot
ball team gets 
e x p e r i ence, 
publicity, and 
financial gains. 
I think that 
Carnegies int e r c ollegiate 
athletic policy should be more ag
gressive in all the major sports in
cluding football, basketball, and 
baseball. It is a shame that CIT 
doesnt have a baseball team.
Stanley Kefalos, junior: Id
like to see Tech play Nebraska 
and some day, Pitt and Duquesne; 
it would do a  . .
ka under the
present conditions the tean. would 
be demoralized. Carnegie needs 
more football players. The whole 
question depends on what kind of 
football we want to play. If we 
are just going to play Nebraska 
and keep to our old schedule, I 
think we should forget the whole 
thing.
Tommy Holleran, sophomore:
Nebraska is out 
of our class. If 
we had a 
stronger team, 
yes, we should 
play them but 
right now I 
dont know 
whether the 
team is up to it. 
I would defin
itely like to see 
us back in class 
A football. Its not that Im noncommital; really, I dont think
were up to it.

who would like to play us. I hope 
that someday we can accept any

then I think we should stick closer 
to home and to our class.
Lois Luebbe, senior: Id like to 
see our team 
play Nebraska, 
but I dont 
think it would
help the team's
morale if they 
were beaten. I 
doubt whether 
it would raise 
school spirit to 
play Nebraska.
I would rather 
see us plav 
class B teams where they have a 
chance of winning. Still, I would 
like to have our football team in 
class A.
Carnegie Tech is not a class A 
team; therefore, should the foot
ball schedule include a class A 
team? The inquiring reporter 
thinks yes, but the students poll
ed say no. The question rests on 
opinion alone.

Cindermen Fourth In
Tri-State Track Meet/
Grove City Men Break Mile Relay 
Record Held By Plaid Trackmen
The Carnegie Plaid bettered their record of last year as they 
finished fourth in a field of eight in the Tri-State track meet held at 
Meadville on Saturday. The Tartans totaled 26V2 points, three points 
better than last spring and just V\ point ahead of Slippery Rock. 
Grove City totaled 49^ points* ~'
to win the meet which saw three 
Tri-State records broken. Alle
gheny followed in second place 
with 30^ points and Westminster 
was third, scoring 28 points. Only 
6 points difference existed between 
second and seventh places in the 
final score.
Grove City broke the Tri-State 
record held by Carnegie Tech in 
the mile relay as they finished in 
3:30.3. This was just 2 seconds 
ahead of the time set by the Ernie 
Cassler sparked relay team of 
1949.
Dick Whitehead of Bethany set 
the new Tri-State record in the 
220 low hurdles as he finished 
ahead of Jim Andrews in 24.6 sec
onds. Westminsters Art Jones

finishing the 220 in 22.1. Fritz 
Wilson of the Plai'd placed fourth 
in the event.

The Skibos encountered some 
stiff competition in hosting the 
linksmen of Grove City, and it 
wasnt until the last foursome 
finished at the Pittsburgh Field 
Club that the outcome of the 
match was definitely settled in 
CITs favor. 10-8.
Trouble At First 
Wes Curtis and Ray Rvabik 
ran into considerable trouble in 
the opening foursom and finished 
behind their opponents by a 1V2 
to 4j/2 count.
In the second round Rich John
son and Ed Denberg took the 
situation in hand and combined 
their scores to post a 4 to 2 con
quest over their opponents.
Cinch Match 
At this point, with the Plaid 
behind by a 6% to 5V2 score, 
Dave Dander and Don Meyers 
went out for the final foursome 
and they both came through with 
creditable scores to post a 4J to 
1V2 win over the Grover four
some to assure the match for the 
Plaid.
On Thursday, May 18, the Tar
tan golf team traveled to Thiel 
Collegewhere they had very lit
tle trouble downing the Thiel 
team by a 13 to 5 count. Good 
weather and a fine course added 
to the ease with which the Skibos 
gained this victory.
Dukes Next
Curtis and Ryabik posted a vic
tory in their round as did Bouska 
and Schober in their foursome. 
Denberg and Dander, playing in 
the second round, encountered the 
only stiff opposition of the day, 
but managed to stay in the fight 
all the way to assure the victory 
for the Tartans.
On May 26 the Tartans will 
complete their season with a 
match against the Duquesne links
men.

Jim Andrews, in his last colle

be top scorer of the Carnegie 
thinclads. Andrews totaled 7% 
points, placing second in the 220 
low hurdles, third in the broad 
jump, and tieing for fourth place 
in the high jump. The Halfertx 
men missed a possible first or sec
ond place in the broad jump when 
poor officiating required re jumps 
to be made. Both Andrews and 
Luchok fell short of their previous 
marks.

Skibo Thinclads Upset Titans 
To Climax Successful Season
In one of the most gruelling and hard-fought track meets ever 
staged in Skibo Bowl. Coach Guy Halfertys Tartan thinclads -came 
Irom behind to edge Westminster College 68-63 last Tuesday.
Trailing by four points with only the broad jump remaining, the 
Plaid needed first and second ? 
places in order to win. Johnny j 
Luchock. Jim Andrews, and Fritz 
Wilson proved to be more than 
equal to the task by sweeping all 
three places, giving the Skibos a 
season dual-meet record of four 
wins and two losses.
Andrews Cops Points 
Jim Andrews and Connie Ham
mann were the top pointmakers 
ior the Tartans. Besides his sec
ond place in the broad jump, An
drews copped first honors in the 
120-yard low hurdles, shot-put. 
javelin, and finished third in the 
high jump.

15.4 seconds and also took first 
place in the high jump.
More Seconds 
Blumfeldt and Green accounted 
for the final Carnegie first place 
by deadlocking for top honors in 
the pole vault. Although the Ti
tans took eight first places to 
seven for the Plaid, the local cin
dermen placed second in'p"10 of 
the 15 events.
Other Tartan pointmakers in
cluded Cooper, second in -the twomile run and third in the mile 
run; Wiewel, second in both the

Five Have Perfect Records 
As Softball Season Progresses
Aided by the peifect weather, the Carnegie Tech softball teams 
played more than 30 games last week. With the season more than 
half over contenders for the campus championships are beginning
to shape up. ?-------------------------------------------
Of the teams who have played
three or more games, only five 
remain with perfect records. In 
the Skibo league Kappa Sigma and 
the Metals Club lead, each with 
records of three victories and no 
defeats. The Sigma Nu-A team 
seems a sure bet to win the Thistle 
league championship if it con
tinues to irrfprove its present 4-0 
record.
In the Plaid league Theta Xi 
leads the parade with a 4-0 mark 
followed closely by the Tau Delts, 
who have chalked up four while 
dropping one. The Phi Kappas in 
the Tartan league complete the
quintet of those with perfect rec
ords, having three wins and no 
losses.
In a game with virtually no er
rors, Myers of Tx and Katselas of 
TNT staged a pitching duel, each 
allowing only one hit until the 
fourth inning. With two men on 
in the fourth, Katselas yielded a 
single to Christopher of TX which 
scored two runs. In the sixth TNT 
scored an unearned run to keep 
their hope alive, but Myers shut 
the door to give Theta Xi a 2-1 
\7ictory.
In another fine game Len Smollen of the Tau Delts, with some 
good support from his team, de
livered a 3-2 victory over Alpha 
Tau Omega. By an identical score 
SAE, with Bob McCain pitching, 
fought off the Dorm Dukes.
In another thriller in the Skibo 
league, which has been providing 
more than its share of close competiion, Kappa Sigma defeated the 
Cyclops 4-3.
Netmen Beat 
Grovers For 
Fourth Victory
Coach Frank Moses Carnegie 
Tech tennis team came back after 
their 9-0 defeat by Pitt to trounce 
the Grove City team by an 8-1 
score at the Skibo courts last Sat
urday. This was the Skibos fourth 
victory of the current campaign.
Bob Weiderhorn got the Tar
tans off to a good start by winning 
the first singles bya6-2,6-4 count. 
CITs second victory was posted 
by Ed Shoemaker in the number 
two spot as he won by a 7-5. 6-1 
score.
John Montstream suffered the 
only setback of the day as he 
bowed to a strong Grover oppo
nent by a 6-2, 6-1 decision.
Tom Latta and A1 Moon con
tinued the winning pace by gain
ing 6-3, 6-1 and 6-4, 7-5 wins 
respectively.
Carnegies final singles victory 
was won by Bob Bassett, who en
countered the toughest opposition 
of the day. Bassett was forced to 
go to three sets before he finally 
won by a 7-5, 6-8, 6-3 margin.
The Skibos managed to make a 
clean sweep of the doubles match
es as Weiderhorn and Montstream, 
Shoemaker and Latta, and Moon 
and Bassett paired off for the 
number one, two, and three dou
bles respectively. As in the case 
of the singles matches, the only 
tough opposition was encountered 
by Moon and Bassett as they were 
forced to go to three sets 7-5, 1-6, 
6-0.

Scotch And Soda 
Chooses Board 
For Corning Year
With the 1950 Scotch and Soda 
just a pleasant memory, the mem
bers of the board of Scotch and 
Soda for the coming year were 
chosen last week. The new mem
bers are Jean Button, A1 Moore, 
Joe Weinreich, Fred Price, Bob 
Larimer, Richard Learner, Dan 
Cantor, and Kenneth Raignol. Un
der their capable direction plans 
are already being formulated for 
next years show.
Also announced was the Scotch 
and Soda picnic which is to be 
held Sunday, May 28. from 2 to 6 
p.m. at the Pavilon in the Schenley Park Oval. All those in any 
way connected with this years 
production are urged to attend.
ing, while transmitters were sit
uated in fraternity houses and 
dorms. Although the operating 
frequency was 600 kilocycles, 
sometimes it could be heard at 900, 
1200, or 1500 kilocycles. In fact, 
transmission was so strong that 
the Federal Communications Com
mission ordered the station to 
cease operations.
Been Underground 
After an absence of two years 
in which the station went under
ground into its planning stage, the 
FCC again recognized the station 
and assigned it the call name of 
WRCT. Following the FCCs sanc
tion, the stations present officers, 
Art Zuch, business manager, Dave 
Steiner, station manager, Phillip 
Mitchell, chief engineer, and Dick 
Means, program manager, began 
concentrated efforts to put the 
show on the road.
Under the present set-up the 
broadcasting is done by the cur
rent carrier system. Simply stat
ed, this means that instead of the 
radio waves being sent out through 
the air, as in normal stations, they 
are sent through the electric wires 
in each building. The FCC stipu
lates that the station must not 
radiate more than 250 feet outside of any building in which it broad
casts. To insure that this restric
tion is met, the transmitters must 
be rather weak. This low transmit
ter frequency is responsible for the 
interference that comes over with 
WRCTs programs.
Operations Center 
The basement of the Union 
houses the newstudio. In the 
studio is a soundproof compart
ment called, The Box, and in
side the Box are microphones and 
record turntables. From this small 
room originate such programs as 
the Chesterfield Show and Five 
Times the Square Root of Sixteen. 
Sometimes the operating engineer 
twiddles his thumbs and sometimes 
he twiddles dials which control 
what comes out of the Box. The 
volume of the emitted speech or 
music is controlled by a little 
needle that jumps up and down. 
Next fall the station will roll 
into full-scale operation with five 
broadcasts a week from about six 
to eleven in the evening and per
haps a morning disc jockey and 
news show. Other projected pro
grams are a complete coverage of 
campus sports events, interviews, 
The Campus Vacuum Cleaner, 
and Whats-Going-On-AroundTown.

And
Views
Pardon us if we begin our clos
ing News and Views for this se
mester with thanks to those stu
dents who perhaps thought our 
column interesting enough to 
read. Dont get us wrong, we are 
just making a bold assumption 
that someone has taken a glimpse 
at our efforts, for we havent re
ceived a word of comment dur
ing the entire year that we have 
headed our information to even
ing students as News and Views.
Incidentally all graduating night 
students who are interested in at
tending the Senior Ball on June 
13 may get tickets from Mr. Mc
Kelway, the Evening School Reg
istrar.
The new play at the Little The
ater, Thornton Wilders The Skin 
of Our Teeth, began May 18 and 
Will run through to Friday even
ing, May 26. This is a fantastic 
comedy dealing with the trials 
and tribulations of the Antrobuse 
family.
The attendance at the dance 
held by Evening Student Council 
on Saturday evening, May 6, was 
not quite up to par, but those that 
did attend all commented on the 
enjoyable time they had at the 
dance.
Since this is the last issue of 
the Plaid for this semester, we 
want to congratulate editors 
George Schussler and Bob Ell
strom on the fine job they have 
done in piloting the Plait, through 
another successful school year. 
Both of these boys have proven 
capable and have unselfishly de
voted much of their time toward 
editing our evening school paper. 
Another evening student who de
serves much credit for his con
sistent contributions to the Plaid 
is Mike Gittens, recent recipient 
of the evening school achievement 
award. Mike has spent many Fri
day evenings during the past 
school year writing articles for 
the Plaid.
Its always interesting to meet 
old friends, and it was more than 
a pleasant surprise to meet A1 
Flanders on campus the other eve
ning. A1 is again attending eve
ning school, but this was the first 
time we had seen him in a good 
while. A1 is now working for 
Weirton Steel Company, and is 
happy with his job. He was Coun
cil President for the school year 
1943-1944.
Byron May, President of Sigma 
Delta Phi, reminds us that the end 
of the school year does not nec
essarily mean the last opportunity 
for members of this group to get 
together. Byron advises us that 
the Sigma Delts have formulated 
a social calendar that will offer 
the fraternity members many acRODGERS

In this, our last issue of the Plaid for the 1949-50 school year, it
is pertinent that we bid farewell to Dr. Doherty and express our
appreciation for his untiring effort toward improving Carnegie Tech's 
financial and scholastic position. He is to be commended for the 
manner in which he constantly worked toward the attainment of 
his objectives, never yielding, seldom compromising. We are grate
ful that Carnegie Tech had the benefits of his guidance and de
termination.
There are those who found fault with his policies. Maybe, his
Carnegie plan has some flaws; perhaps football should have been
eliminated rather than de-emphasized. There are, no doubt, many 
schools of thought that would have found justifiable reasons for 
adopting policies in opposition to those that were selected by Dr. 
Doherty. It must be admitted, however, that his reasoning was sound, 
and his advice resulted in improved conditions.
In accepting the responsibilities of the office his successor, Dr. 
Warner, inherits a man-sized job. We feel that he is worthy of our 
confidence, and offer him our support. We will be interested in 
learning his ideas and ideals; we will be happy to have the oppor
tunity to place some of our suggestions on his desk for consideration.
To Dr. Doherty we extend best wishes for continued good health 
and happiness; and it is our sincere hope that in his new duties Dr. 
Warner will enjoy unlimited success.
Signed,

It definitely is a long, hard 
grind, but half the battle is keep
ing up ones morale when the go
ing gets tough. The fact that the 
number of students graduating 
from evening school is steadily in
creasing is proof enough that it 
can be done if the incentive is 
great enough.
Examinations
Final examinations of the 
spring semester will begin 
Monday, May 29. Schedules of 
the examinations have been 
posted on the bulletin boards.

Council
[Continiced from page 1]
Minetti memorial public address j 
system.
Art Zuch, desiring clarification 
on Lunts proposal to enlarge the 
duties of the social committee, 
wished to know if the amendment 
would mean that the social com
mittee would handle its own 
budgets. Social chairman Jack 
Stewart seemed reluctant to ac
cept the proposed measure; in his 
report he stated that the social 
committee was anothercase of 
lots of responsibility and not 
one iota of authority. Unable to 
reach a quick decision on the pro
posal, Council tabled the motion 
indefinitely.
Officers Elected
Council approved the results of 
the last election and opened the 
floor to nominations for officers. 
Dick Holl nominated Art Chris
topher to perpetuate the spirit 
of the present council. Council
man Broida spoke for Susanne 
Menger on the grounds that it 
was time to give the girls a 
chance; he said that the men had 
not exploited the full possibili
ties of council and that the girls 
should be given a chance to do 
better.
Janice Seiner stood for Fred 
Price on the basis of earnestness, 
experience, and non-partisanship. 
Voting was by secret ballot, and 
Christopher was elected. The

will become vice-president.
Parting Words
Retiring President Koester 
thanked the Council members for 
their cooperation. He said Coun
cil faces a two fold problem: to 
find and correct campus difficul^ 
ties for the benefit of the students, 
and to let these students know 
what Council has been doing. He 
felt that much had been done to 
fulfill the first objective but that 
the second aim needed more at
tention by future Councils.
This Wednesday will be the 
last Council meeting for this year. 
President Christopher is expected 
to appoint his committee chair
men at this meeting. _-------------------------------------i
