Students help Appalachians and tsunami victims over break
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
When Nadine Lippa blew her 
nose last week, it wasnt because 
she was upset for the end of 
spring break. Congested after 
cleaning the bathroom ceiling 
in an Appalachian home, the 
first-year materials science en
gineering major experienced 
something unexpected when she 
cleared her nasal passages. My 
nose expelled bat droppings, 
she said.
Lippas batty experience oc
curred while helping to renovate 
a home in McDowell County, 
West Virginia last week as part 
of the Alternative Spring Break 
Experience (ASBE).
M. Shernell Smith, coordina
tor of student development and 
housefellow for New House, took 
six students to the countrys fifth 
poorest county to give service
where they felt it was sorely 
needed.
Working on the opposite side 
of Smiths office in the Office of 
Student Development, Mohana 
Rajakumar also arranged a ser
vice project over spring break. 
However, Rajakumar spent the 
week on the opposite 
side of the world.
Coordinator of 
Student Development 
and a Housefellow for 
Morewood E Tower,
Rajakumar organized 
a trip to India to work 
with orphans of the 
December tsunami.
Rajakumar brought a 
few friends, a photog
rapher with the Associated Press, 
and Meghan Laskowski, a junior 
computer science major and 
 leadership intern in the Office of 
Student Development.
Originally from India, 
Rajakumar knows the founders
of an orphanage that houses stu
dents who lost one or both par
ents in the December tsunami. 
Rajakumar planned the visit on 
an individual basis and solicited 
private donations to fund the 
trip.
Meanwhile, her coworker
Smith planned ASBE in conjunc
tion with Student Development 
Office and the Office of 
International Education. As 
Smith brainstormed ideas of 
places to take her students, she 
knew she wanted it to be a ru
ral experience. When she came
across the Big Creek People in 
Action, Inc., she knew she found 
her destination. When you think 
of people in need, you think mi
nority. I wanted [the students] to 
be exposed to poverty in a differ
ent way, Smith said.
Spending a week in McDowell
--------- County,West
Virginia, was a com
pletely different ex
perience from that of 
Rajakumars in India. 
Group members 
quickly got rid of 
preconceived ideas 
of the citizens in the 
county. I went there 
expecting the peo
ple to be hicks, but 
they werent. These people were 
proud of who they are. They may 
not have money, but they have 
things that people here dont, 
Lippa said.
Mingi Kim, a junior majoring 
in business administration and
modern languages, agreed. You 
go in with your preconceived no
tions of what it is to be successful 
and happy, she said. But they 
were happy where they were.
During the week, the group 
renovated the interior of a di
lapidated five-person family 
house. Among its projects for 
the house, the group repaired 
plumbing, replaced a sink, and 
cleaned bat droppings out of 
the ceiling. According to several 
group members, the father of the 
family stayed quiet and reserved 
during much of the week, but 
on the last day shrugged off his 
pride and said thank you for the 
first time in a way that touched 
everyone on the trip.
It wasnt just that we fixed 
up their house, said Gautam 
Daswani, a first-year business 
major. It wasnt just a physical 
thing. It was also a mental thing.

Norman Finkelstein draws 
students, locals to speech
by Michelle Bova
Assistant Pillbox Editor
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
University will not face severe 
cuts to transit routes or increased 
fares immediately, thanks to 
Pennsylvania Governor Ed 
Rendells last-minute allocation 
of highway flex funds to subsi
dize Pittsburgh transit.
However, because of the way 
the funding was distributed, the 
Port Authority may face prob
lems again as early as this July.
Stephen Donahue, co-founder 
of the organization Save Our 
Transit, said of the flex fund
ing: What they [the legislature] 
voted on is only enough money 
to get us through the next fiscal
year, which begins on July 1. As 
Donahue explained, Rendell will 
have to ask the legislature for the 
remaining funds to go to the Port 
Authority for the next fiscal year 
on this date.
Theres no guarantee that we 
will be able to go back to that 
[money], said Donahue.
Donahue also said that Save 
Our Transit has begun to write 
letters to Harrisburg urging leg
islators to take action again as 
of March 11. Save Our Transit 
wants the legislators to deal with 
structural issues such as the pro
vision against using gas taxes to 
fund transit.

Staffwriter
The line to enter McConomy 
auditorium last Monday evening 
stretched all the way to the second 
floor of the University Center. Dr. 
Norman Finkelstein, a scholar on 
Zionism and son of Holocaust sur
vivors, was lecturing on what he 
calls the misuse of anti-Semitism 
and the abuse of history. Hosted 
by Students for Justice in Palestine 
and the Pittsburgh Palestine 
Solidarity Committee, his presence 
drew a full crowd of supporters  
and several detractors  for both 
Israel and Palestine.
Dr. Finkelstein claimed that his
torically and 
factually, there 
is little to no 
disagreement 
between seri
ous scholars 
and research
ers on the topic 
of the Israeli/
Palestinian 
conflict. His 
main argu
ment was that Norman Finkelstein
by and large, most of the con
troversy surrounding the Israel/ 
Palestine conflict is contrived, con
jured up. Its a fake controversy, to 
diverge attention from the histori
cal record.
Finkelstein specified aspects of 
the conflict over which he believed 
there is no disagreement. Israel/ 
Palestine is very closely monitored 
by human rights organizations, 
he said. ...All human rights orga
nizations agree that Israel, since 
the onslaught of the occupation, 
has been systematically torturing 
Palestinian detainees....
Finkelstein also explained that 
while there may be a factual con
sensus on many issues relating 
to the conflict, moral interpreta
tions of those facts vary. In 1948, 
when Israel was declared a state 
and was later attacked by several 
Arab nations, Israel expelled many 
Palestinians from their land in the 
Middle East. Finkelstein said he 
considered that an act of ethnic 
cleansing.
You can agree that they 
[Palestinians] were ethni
cally cleansed in 1948; you can 
agree that is a moral crime, said 
Finkelstein. You can agree that le
gally... they have the right to return 
to their homes...but still disagree 
on the political side of the ques
tion.
Finkelstein cited the 1989 UN 
resolution to create a two-state set
tlement, which passed 151-3. He 
pointed out that the only dissent
ers in that decision were Israel, the 
United States, and the Caribbean 
state of Dominica. He accused 
Israel and the U.S. of mystify
ing the Israel/Palestine conflict, 
to pretend as if [it] is not compa
rable to any other conflict, to pre
tend that there are cosmic issues 
at stake....
If in any other _conflict, 
Finkelstein continued, one were 
to invoke the kinds of cosmic ex
planations you find when it comes 
to the Israel/Palestine conflict, the 
reaction would be one of ridicule.
This brought Finkelstein to his 
most controversial argument. He 
alleged that the Nazi Holocaust 
of Jews figured trivially in 
American Jewish life until June 
1967, when Israel captured the 
contested Palestinian lands in the 
famous Six Day War. Since that

On Saturday, nearly 3000 
Pittsburgh residents marched 
from Squirrel Hill to Oakland to 
protest the second anniversary 
of the war in Iraq. A myriad of 
banners, puppets, costumes, and 
songs marked the event. Signs 
displaying statistics and govern
ment spending figures accompa
nied chants of Who Would Jesus 
Bomb? and Money for jobs and 
education, not for war and oc
cupation!
Two rallies with speakers brack
eted the march, touching on a 
wide variety of topics from slavery 
to Congress current investigation 
on steroid use in major league 
baseball. The speakers scathingly 
criticized the government, claim
ing it was out of touch with issues 
important to the youth and poor 
of America.
The crowd was really diverse, 
said Jonah McAllister, a University 
of Pittsburgh student and mem
ber of Pitt Students Against War.

Presidential perspectives: Run for student government this year
Erik Michaels-Ober
I hope that you all enjoyed your spring 
break.
During my week off, I traveled to Doha, 
Qatar, with 12 other students  as well 
as faculty, administrators, and trustees  
for the inauguration of Carnegie Mellons 
Qatar campus. Although classes at the 
Qatar campus have been running since 
last semester, the inaugural gala marked 
the ceremonial opening of the campus. 
The event included speeches by President 
Cohon and Her Highness Sheikha Mozah 
Bint Nasser Al-Missned, wife of the Emir 
of Qatar and chairwoman of the Qatar
Foundation for Education, Science and 
Community Development.
While in Qatar, I saw a presentation 
about the future of Education City, 
the development where our campus is 
located. The presentation included an 
artists rendition of Carnegie Mellons 
future building, designed by the Mexican 
firm of Legorreta and Legorreta. The 
plans for this building include state-ofthe-art classrooms, computer labs, and 
an indoor atrium. The 400,000-squarefoot facility is scheduled to open by the 
fall of 2007. Currently, Carnegie Mellon 
shares facilities with the Weill Cornell 
Medical College in Qatar.
This was my second trip to Qatar, after 
spending five weeks there last summer. 
One of my goals last summer was to lay
the foundation for Student Government 
at the Qatar campus. I am very pleased 
to report that they elected an 11-member 
Student Majlis (majlis is an Arabic word 
meaning senate) just three weeks into 
their first semester. Fahad Al-Jefairi was 
elected to serve as their first Student 
Body President.
Fahad and six other students from 
the Qatar campus will be coming to 
Pittsburgh next week to visit our campus. 
I hope that you will welcome them to our 
community.
I would also like to remind you that 
it is not too late for undergraduates to 
run for Student Senate. To appear on the 
ballot, you must submit a petition with 
at least 25 signatures from students in 
your college to University Center Box 46
by five pm on March 25. You can pick 
up a petition at the University Center 
Information Desk or online at www. 
stusen.org/id/petition.pdf. Candidates 
should review the newly revised Student 
Government Election Rules online at 
www.stusen.org/policy/election_rules. 
pdf.
Student Government elections will take 
place on April 4 and 5. Please remember 
to vote. Questions about the election can 
be directed to Elections Board Chair Mark 
Roboff (mroboff@andrew.cmu.edu).
Please do not hesitate to visit the Student 
Body President during his office hours 
 Wednesdays from 4:30 to 6:30 pm 
in University Center 318F  or e-mail

The newspaper bins of the Collegiate 
Readership Program have reappeared 
on campus, and the newspapers will 
return today, as the undergraduate 
student body votes to approve a $5- 
per-semester newspaper fee to pay for 
the program next year. But the bargain 
isnt quite as sweet as it sounds.
At first glance, the program seems 
too good to be true: five bucks a year 
for daily subscriptions to three respect
ed newspapers is an appealing offer.
But the Collegiate Readership Program 
isnt that idealistic or straightforward. 
The program, managed by USA TODAY, 
solicits universities to join and states its 
objective is to enhance the learning 
environment on university campuses by 
providing students with an opportunity 
to be more informed about the events 
shaping their lives. I dont buy it.
The Collegiate Readership Program 
has more to do with advertisers than 
with students. Remember that in 
the corporate newspaper business, 
newspapers are not whats being sold. 
You, the audience of the newspaper, 
are being sold to advertisers. We are 
a $116-billion-per-year market that 
companies pay handsomely to access. 
Quite simply, through this program, 
USA TODAY hopes to increase the size 
of its audience among our demographic 
in order to make its product more 
appealing to its advertisers. In fact, 
the Newspaper Association of America 
reportedly promoted the program to 
potential member newspapers as a 
way to recover advertising revenue 
that would otherwise be lost to student 
newspapers.
The point is not that advertising is bad 
 The Tartan, too, survives on funds 
provided by advertisements. The point 
is that if we are to fund a newspaper dis
tribution program, it should not be USA 
TODAYs College Readership Program, 
which is designed to solely maximize 
their corporate profits; instead it should 
be a program tailored to CMU students.
The most apparent problem is that 
every student will pay for a service 
not every student will be able to use. 
If 1700 copies are distributed on a 
campus inhabited by 9000 students, 
theres a good chance that many of the 
5500 undergraduates who want a copy 
wont get one.
Furthermore, passively setting out 
copies of The New York Times, USA 
TODAY, and the Post-Gazette may not 
effectively enhance the learning en
vironment at CMU. The Collegiate 
Readership Program does not give our 
student body access to content it can
not already get. The New York Times, the 
Post-Gazette, and USA TODAY all offer 
their content free online, and many of 
the students who will want to pick up 
the free newspapers already read the 
news on their computer screens.
Perhaps a better approach would 
be to provide free newspapers for the 
first two weeks at the beginning of 
each semester to promote newspaper 
readership, then let students purchase 
the relatively inexpensive, student-rate 
subscriptions to the newspaper of their 
choice. If students individually choose 
to invest in a newspaper subscription, 
then they will be much more likely to 
read that newspaper regularly and 
thoroughly. If we feel that helping 
some students gain access to a news
paper contributes to a better environ
ment, the subscription costs could even 
be subsidized by student government.
Otherwise, we should consider 
working directly with the publication 
we want. The New York Times bins were 
consistently empty, while USA TODAY 
and the Post-Gazette were left at the 
stands. Columbia University under
went the trial period, then decided to 
get a bulk rate subscription with The 
New York Times. We should consider 
doing the same, in order to better meet 
our exact needs.
The Collegiate Readership Program 
is not quite all it seems. When the pro
gram is put to an undergraduate refer
endum on April 4-5, I hope students 
consider how much they will actually 
benefit from the program.

That look n his face when he 
said thank you  it hit me really 
hard.
Having a choice between going 
on the service experience and 
going to Panama City with his 
friends, Daswani chose the West 
Virginia destination. According to 
Daswani, the communitys hospi
tality assured him that he made 
the right choice.
Even though they were all 
white, they were so cordial that I 
didnt feel any racial differences, 
said Daswani, who is of Indian 
descent but lives in Hong Kong. 
It was amazing.
Smith agrees. The service 
was reciprocal. They [students] 
learned so much from the people 
in this community.
In addition to the service proj
ect, Smith made certain that the 
group became immersed in the 
communitys culture. They vis
ited a mine exhibition to gain an 
understanding of the areas eco
nomic history and the lifestyle in 
a mining community.
Composed of several interna
tional students, the group also 
shared its own cultural back
grounds with the town by giving 
a multicultural talk to elementary 
school students.
While Smiths group talked 
to elementary students in West 
Virginia, Rajakumars group 
spent spring break working with
orphaned children half a world 
away.
Rajakumar arranged for one of 
her friends, an elementary school 
teacher in Florida, to partner the 
Florida school with the Indian 
orphanage. The plan is for the 
school in the States ... to partner 
with the orphanage to help these 
children know that they are loved, 
cared for, and that others in the 
world want to know about them 
and care for them, she said.
According to Rajakumar, the 
30 children in the orphanage 
are fairly well-adjusted now. 
However, she feels the effect of
the December wave will hit them 
when theyre older, especially the 
girls, who, in Indian culture, de
pend on their parents to broker 
marriage.
Laskowski recounted the stories 
that the older kids told of their ex
perience after the tsunami. You 
could see in their face that it was 
still painful, yet they would try to 
hide it with a smile. And five min
utes later, theyd go hang out with 
their friends and act like the chil
dren that they were, she said.
The group also saw a mass 
burial ground for 300 victims of 
the disaster and a beach still scat
tered with tsunami debris. Its so 
hard to comprehend, Laskowski 
said.
It was overwhelming  com
ing back was hard. Now its like 
whats next? Rajakumar said.
According to Rajakumar and 
Smith, planning long-term part
nerships is next. Rajakumar hopes 
to return to the orphanage With a 
group this summer.
As for the members of the 
ASBE, Smith says they hope to 
form a partnership with the Big 
Creek People in Action commu
nity center, possibly adopting the 
technology room in the center.

to Pittsburgh transit as early as 
October 2004, when Student 
Senate began posting notices 
of potential cuts around cam
pus. The literature indicated 
that buses faced service cuts 
on nights and weekends, when 
students most frequently use 
public transportation. Student 
Senate also organized a letter-writing campaign to the 
legislature in Harrisburg. 
Student body president Erik 
Michaels-Ober said that there 
were over 1000 letters written 
by students concerned with the 
possible cuts.
Michaels-Ober said of the 
temporary resolution, The 
real goal is to get a permanent 
source of funding. Recently, 
several potential tax increases 
that would create revenue for 
the Port Authority were pre
sented to the state legislature; 
all were voted down.
Most states subsidize 
their transit with gas taxes, 
'but we cant do that in this 
state, said Michaels-Ober. 
The Pennsylvania constitution 
stipulates that gas taxes go to
wards other areas than transit 
funding.
Prior to February 28, the 
28X Airport Flyer was just
one bus scheduled for re
duced service. Michaels-Ober 
said that preliminary discus
sions were held between 
members of Student Senate 
and the University administra
tion, during which it was sug

At the Forbes Avenue bus 
stop by Morewood Gardens 
last Friday morning, Michael 
Shoupe,- a junior in mechanical 
engineering, waited for one of 
the 61s to stop by. Shoupe was 
unaware that the guarantee of 
funding for transit lasted only 
until July 1.
A resident of Squirrel Hill, 
Shoupe noted that he usually 
uses the bus twice a day. Right 
now I just wait 10 minutes 
and a bus shows up, he said, 
noting that he does not gener
ally check the schedule. If the 
times when buses ran were re

ahead. He added that he has 
labs that meet during the night. 
It makes it tough if they cut the 
late ones [buses].
The votes in Harrisburg this

concerns will again become 
a reality for the 2005-2006 
school year.

Anti-war protest marches down ForbesFinkelstein says Mid-East 
conflict is engineered
Finkelsteins accusations of eth
nic cleansing. What kind of eth
nic cleansing program offers the 
only nation in the entire Middle 
East where Palestinians have a 
free press, access to a Supreme 
Court, the right to vote, three 
separate Palestinian political 
parties in the Israeli parliament, 
equal rights for women, legal 
protection under the law for ho
mosexuals, and a government 
health plan including mother 
care programs for Palestinian 
mothers and infants? asked 
Kalson.
Also in attendance was Jack 
Sittsamer, a Holocaust survivor. 
Sittsamer, who works at the 
Holocaust Center in Squirrel 
Hill, said he was disgusted by 
Finkelsteins lecture.
After all [the Israelis] have 
been through, they deserve a 
little state, Sittsamer said. 
Sittsamer agreed with Kalson 
that Israel should serve as an 
example to other Middle Eastern 
countries of a progressive, dem
ocratic state.
To Finkelsteins claim that 
the Holocaust wasnt talked 
about before 1967, Sittsamer 
argues, most survivors cannot 
talk about their experiences.... 
I dont question his research, 
[but] what do you do when 
youre attacked? You defend 
yourself.
PROTEST, from A1
American community ... good age 
distribution, a good gender dis
tribution. Everybody was able to 
march in contingents with no real 
stress there.
As some expected, confronta
tion occurred between brothers at 
the Delta Upsilon fraternity and 
the protesters as the march con
tinued down Forbes Avenue past 
Carnegie Mellon. The fraternity 
brothers displayed signs with slo
gans such as Iran is Next, Blow 
up Iraq, and I (heart) Bombs. 
In response, a quartet of protest
ers saluted in the direction of the 
fraternity house in reference to 
Nazism, pumping their arms in 
the air. One masked marcher took 
a sign from the fraternitys lawn 
and snapped it in half.
Some protesters taunted the 
brothers to come onto the street. 
However, most of the marchers 
passed by without incident. I 
was happy how people handled 
passing by the frats at CMU, said 
McAllister. Most people just ig
nored them. I was really pleased 
the Anarchist contingent was able 
to interact without any problems 
or hostility.
I always look at it that an injury 
to one is an injury to all, he said. 
Its important that everybody 
recognize that different views 
on how to dissent are accepted. 
Nobody is seen as the legitimate
protesters and that theyre just a 
bunch of troublemakers. There 
was space for everybody to be 
involved, from rowdy youth to 
parents with little children.
In fact, parents turned out in 
force. Strollers were common, 
with young mothers and fathers 
carrying their children in make
shift slings and tucking them in
side jackets.
The march route started at the 
intersection of Forbes and Murray 
Avenues in Squirrel Hill, followed 
the road to Oakland, then turned 
onto South Craig Street to Fifth 
Avenue until it ended in front of 
the William Pitt Union.
Its the largest protest weve 
had' since the war began. Many 
people have joined this protest 
who initially supported the war 
and now have come around 
against it, said Tim Vining, ex
ecutive director of the Thomas 
Merton Center, a Pittsburgh or
ganization that supports a wide 
variety of social justice events.
Despite its success, the march 
still drew dissenters. Dennis 
Wodzinski, a Duquesne University 
graduate history student, walked 
in front of the crowd holding a 
sign thanking soldiers and read
ing Real Liberals Fight Tyranny. 
He explained he was not there as 
a pro-war activist, but in support 
of an effort to change things.
He added, I think freedoms 
are worth protecting.
ISRAEL, from A1
time, Finkelstein claimed, the 
Holocaust has served as a cul
tural trump card, used to defray 
scrutiny and criticism.
Regarding claims of a resurging anti-Semitism in Europe, 
Finkelstein said, A not-so-new 
hysteria has been whipped up;
< its called the new anti-Semitism. 
Whats striking ... is that one, it s 
not new, and two, it has noth
ing to do with anti-Semitism. 
He called claims of a new antiSemitism sheer, unadulterated 
fraud.
At the conclusion of 
Finkelsteins lecture, Carnegie 
Mellon professor M.J. Small 
delivered a ten-minute rebut
tal. A flier, signed by the Arab 
Student Organization, the 
Muslim Student Association, the 
Pittsburgh Palestine Solidarity 
Committee, and Students for 
Justice in Palestine, maligned 
the altered lecture format, ask
ing, Is this a precedent CMU 
is now setting for its guest 
speakers, or does this apply only 
to scholars critical of Israel...?
Finkelsteins lecture also faced 
intense protest and disapproval 
from the local Jewish commu
nity. Richard Kalson, an attor
ney and Hillel Jewish University 
Center board member since 
1994, objected particularly to

There are few better targets for oncampus rebuilding than the On-line Reg
istration (OLR) website. Through it, OLR 
transforms every computer into an en
rollment kiosk; its convenience goes un
noticed in this era of instant information 
gratification. Year after year, however, 
OLR lets us down. There hasnt been a 
recent semester without some downtime 
at a critical moment, depriving students 
of registration at their designated time
 a frustrating and unnecessary incon
venience.
Students of a particular class used to 
register whenever they wanted on their 
specific day. The early bird got the* 12- 
unit worm. However, high traffic loads 
stressed the system to its breaking point, 
leading Enrollment Services to corral stu
dents into time slots using a random 
method involving student ID numbers. 
Instead of raising the system up' to 
higher standards, Enrollment Services 
demanded students lower their expecta
tions. Why should they, when we have 
some of the premier computer science 
and information technology resources in 
the country?
Its not all bad. The OLRs First Steps 
page kindly reminds students to mark 
their calendars for the start of registra
tion: April 20-22, 1998. The system is 
well intentioned and well executed for its 
age  nearly seven years  but it is time 
for change.
There are myriad potential places to
start, but its time for a clean slate. Using 
the current registration process, a stu
dent shuffles endlessly between many 
different websites: OLR, Faculty Course 
Evaluations, Interactive Schedule of 
Classes, and Course Information Online, 
not to mention any other sources of class 
descriptions, such as the perennially outof-date catalog and department-specific 
manuals.
Enrollment Services should bring all 
of the resources to one place, as with 
CMUs new portal website, where 
students can get mail, announcements, 
news, and weather all at once. Making 
course names searchable would make 
finding courses much easier. After a 
course was selected, a series of screens 
would make course availability, waitlist 
status, campus location, course descrip
tions, and potential schedule conflicts a 
click away. Each course name could be 
a hyperlink to the FCEs for that course, 
opening in another frame or window.
Printable maps with directions to class
rooms could help first-years find their 
way on campus. Amazon.com-like sug
gestions can help determine what those 
last 9 units should be filled with: Stu
dents who took Style also took Advanced 
Journalism.
CMU is a university that bills itself as 
a top technology school, and the shoddy 
nature of the OLR system is nothing 
short of an embarrassment. We have the 
technology; we can rebuild OLR.

Tepper acted inappropriately 
in rejecting potential students
The Tepper School of Business made 
national headlines with its decision to 
deny admission to two applicants who 
had gained unauthorized access to their 
own admissions decisions. The Tepper 
School made the wrong decision. Their 
choice continues to represent Carnegie 
Mellon as a university unwilling to take 
appropriate action in challenging situa
tions.
These two applicants, like the more 
than 100 other applicants at other major 
business schools who peeked at their 
admissions status, did something wrong; 
there is no need to debate the point. 
Worth debating, though, is the schools 
response. The Tepper administration 
overreacted by denying admission to 
these candidates in order to take a strong 
public stand against unethical behavior, 
independent of the candidates merits.
This response undermines the Tepper 
Schools purpose as an educational insti
tution. The school has a'responsibility 
to teach business ethics, and this was a 
perfect opportunity. Instead of making an 
example out of the applicants, the school 
could have required these two students to 
take additional ethics courses (assuming 
they would have been admitted under 
normal procedures).
The applicants may have been too curi
ous for their own good, but theyre hardly 
felons. It is extremely likely that a sig
nificant number of the admitted students 
have committed far worse offenses in 
their time. By denying these two students 
admission, the Tepper School is setting a 
dangerous precedent: if other applicants 
have jaywalked, or received a parking 
ticket, will they too be denied admission? 
Where does one draw the line in deciding 
which applicants to consider?
The Tepper School should not act as
the arbiter of petty moral infractions; it 
should do what it does best: teach these 
students. Turning applicants away does 
not accomplish anything. In the postEnron world, every business school wor
ries about whether or not they are doing 
enough to teach ethics. This introspec
tion is a good start, but it has to be fol
lowed up with a reasoned and thoughtful 
approach to applied ethics.
Instead of analyzing a nuanced situ
ation and choosing the most appropri-. 
ate response, the school decided to act 
tough for the cameras when they should 
have acted smart. In the waves of moral 
condemnation that have spewed forth in 
press releases and editorials in the past 
few weeks, these applicants were accused 
of being hackers and criminals. Its easy 
to apply these pejorative statements to 
faceless individuals, but its much hard
er to see; them as overeager applicants 
who wanted nothing more than to know 
where theyd be living next year. They 
made a mistake, and the Tepper School 
threw the baby out with the bathwater.
State Republicans fail public transit

it reduces traffic congestion and helps 
the environment by decreasing fuel con
sumption, conserving fuel and keeping 
our air breathable.
An effective, affordable, and efficient 
public transit system yields a number 
of benefits, but somehow most Repub
licans in state government fail to see 
that. They are market fundamentalists, 
believing in the nature of markets to 
solve everything, even though history 
and economic theory have persistently 
shown that markets fail to provide ad
equate levels of public goods. The Re
publicans controlling the legislature 
cling to their rural districts, refusing to 
allow funding for public transit in urban 
areas despite the fact that cities provide 
the economic footing for the state, most 
of the jobs, and most of the goods. They 
also ignore the direct benefits public 
transit can bring to rural areas, given 
that there are shuttles and vans in many 
towns that allow those without a car to 
get around.
Luckily, there is a solution to our pubalso has smart, innovative, and techno

month talking to students and collecting 
signatures for his ballot access, in addi
tion to recently speaking to Heinz stu
dents and participating in a discussion 
in Mudge House last spring.
I strongly encourage you all to regis
ter to vote for the Democratic primary, 
and to vote for a public-transit-friendly 
candidate; even if you dont consider 
yourself a Democrat and plan on switch
ing back the next day. The winner of the 
Democratic primary has won the mayoral race for'the past seven decades, and' 
the last Democratic primary came down 
to 699 votes, so the 30,000 students in 
Pittsburgh could easily make a differ

our mouths are.

Editorial Dissent
It seems that those about to enter the 
professional fields havent learned any 
lessons from the past five years of corpo
rate scandals. The applicants who hacked 
into the Tepper Schools database con
sciously followed the specific and inap
propriate directions of a boasting hacker 
in order to access unpublicized informa
tion to which they were not entitled. 
If Tepper condoned such behavior and 
admitted these applicants, who so elabo
rately circumnavigated the rules, there is 
no telling what other rules the students 
would feel comfortable breaking.By getting involved in local elections, we can vote out of office the

a band-aid fix, and will only hold us 
through 2006. The Pennsylvania state 
government will need to step in to secure 
a reliable and dedicated form of funding 
to save public transit, and we will need 
to hold them to it by participating in lo
cal and state elections.
Public transit offers innumerable eco
nomic benefits, improves the quality of 
life for many people, and is good for the 
environment. It allows students and the 
poor to work jobs that they otherwise 
wouldnt be able to work  reducing 
unemployment rates, giving them mon
ey to spend, and providing employers 
with workers. It allows people to attend 
events and visit stores that they wouldnt 
otherwise be able to reach, which in
creases the revenue of local businesses. 
It gives the elderly and disabled a large 
degree of independence by providing 
them a means of transit without having 
to depend on others. It even increases 
the attractiveness of Pittsburgh as a city 
for students thinking of going to col
lege here, in addition to people looking 
to move here. Transit directly provides 
over 15,000 jobs and contributes billic transit funding woes, and it involves 
voting in local and state elections. By 
getting involved in local elections, we 
can vote out of office the state legisla
tors that put transit in the mess that its 
in now, and we can elect transit-friendly 
politicians who are more responsive to 
the people.
There is a mayoral race coming up 
in Pittsburgh. Democrats outnumber 
Republicans by a ratio of five to one in 
Pittsburgh, and so the real race is for 
the Democratic nomination, on May 17. 
Many people are switching their reg
istrations to Democratic to vote for the 
primary, as they can do so until April 18 
and are allowed to switch back the next 
day.
One candidate for mayor, Councilman 
Bill Peduto, stands out as a strong and 
consistent advocate for public transit. 
He is the only candidate who has made 
public transit a central issue of his cam
paign, and in City Council he introduced 
a resolution calling on the Southwestern 
Pennsylvania Commission to approve 
Gov. Rendells bailout of public transit, 
which it ultimately approved. Peduto
Pittsburgh, and its time to make our 
voices heard. We need a strong advo
cate for public transit as mayor, so that 
he can pressure state government into 
doing the right thing and fix the citys 
financial problems so that more funding 
will be available for transit. We also 
need a strong turnout so that the Port 
Authority realizes we are a force to be 
reckoned with and thinks twice before, 
cutting popular bus routes.
Additionally, I encourage you to check, 
out the website for Students for Peduto,! 
the only student group for a particular! 
campaign, at StudentsForPeduto.com,; 
and to read the candidates websites at;

Reality TV perpetuates poor body image, unrealistic standards
Isabel Gardocki
Its a strange feeling watching 
a skinny girl on television crying 
about being the fat one among 
a group of living skeletons.
The girl is pretty, blond, and 
a contestant on UPNs hit reality 
show, Americas Next Top Model. 
The tears stream down her 
cheeks, and the camera zooms 
in on her confession: something 
along the lines of, I know Ive 
gained weight over the past few 
days, but I promise I can work it 
off. The important part is that 
my younger sister is sitting next 
to me, absorbing this like its her 
new religion. Her modeling au
ditions are in five days.
The girl on Americas Next 
Top Model just underwent the 
weigh-in, a moment on the 
show where all the girls take 
turns stepping on the scale to 
find out if they put on any weight 
from one episode to the next. 
One girl on the show is 5' 10" 
and weighs 117 pounds. The 
government considers someone 
underweight if they have a Body 
Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 or 
less. This girl has a BMI of 16.8.1 
wonder how the judges can label 
her beautiful. She was probably 
pretty once, before her cheeks 
sunk in and her sternum started 
showing.
These types of beauty shows 
have taken off in the last few sea
sons. America now has Extreme 
Makeovers, I Want a Famous 
Face, and The Swan. Viewers can 
tune in as Ugly Jane from Small 
Town gets her nose broken, teeth 
capped, and fat sucked out from 
her chin. We get to see her lying 
in the hospital after the surgery 
with swollen lips and a chest 
that doesnt look human. We get 
to witness the great unveiling 
where Ugly Jane becomes Beau
tiful Jane and hugs her family 
and friends. Everyone claps. The 
finished product (as thats what 
it is) always makes me smile 
because the woman appears so 
confident and overjoyed with
herself. I celebrate with her. Be
fore her dramatic change, she 
was insecure at the beach and in 
front of the other soccer moms, 
but now she can hold her head 
up high at the grocery store.
However, I think that a lot of 
what is done to the woman is 
simply thrown in to add to the
drama of her transformation. 
On most of these makeover and 
beauty shows, the contestants 
physical issues could be resolved 
with a simple makeup lesson 
and flattering dress. Instead, the 
new woman will go back to her 
old life with a few new outfits 
and no knowledge of how to do
her hair in the morning or how to 
apply mascara just right.
The experts always achieve 
their amazing transformations 
with the help of an armada of 
expensive makeup. They are 
able to add that glow to their 
makeover guinea pig because 
they mix the best products on the
market with flattering camera 
angles. But the made-over 
women arent taught how to re
peat the effects for the next day. 
The information often comes in 
little snippets, like Brush the 
blush up, not down, while the 
makeup artist does a million 
other things and talks about how 
wonderful the contestant is going 
to look. Successfully recreating 
the look later is not an option.
Over the years, what the 
media has created as the ideal 
for American women is geneti
cally impossible for most of the 
population. According to the 
National Eating Disorders As
sociation, the average American 
model is 5'11" tall and weighs 
117 pounds. In fact, most fash
ion models are thinner than 98 
percent of all American women. 
Its no wonder that four out of 
five American women say theyre 
dissatisfied with the way they 
look.
Even my sister, who already 
has a body mass of 17.7, was told 
by a modeling agency to lose 
three inches at the waist and one 
inch at the hips so she could have 
a shot during her auditions. Isnt 
she already skinny enough? She 
has almost no fat on her body; 
at this point she is probably los
ing muscle mass. How does this 
make her prettier?
In real life, it doesnt take 
drastic weight loss to make a 
person beautiful. Most of it 
comes from personality; whether 
someone is fun to be around or 
mean makes a huge difference. 
Look around and youll see that 
the people who are always sur
rounded by others are the ones 
who devote their time to liv
ing rather than those who have 
sold their souls to the House of 
Chanel.
Regardless of what the media 
tries to tell us, no one will ever 
be a perfect person, even with 
the help of plastic surgery or the 
advice of professionals.

Tensions between China and Taiwan not as grave as some believe
Alexander Su
Earlier this week, Chinas top 
legislative body approved a reso
lution to resort to non-peaceful 
means to stop Taiwan from de
claring its independence.
China has considered Taiwan 
a renegade province ever since 
the Communists drove the Na
tionalists out of the mainland to 
Taiwan in 1949. Though the two 
countries do not have official dip
lomatic relations, there are unde
niable symbiotic economic rela
tions, as thousands of Taiwanese 
live and work in China.
This latest piece of legislation, 
though, has caused an uproar 
among the Taiwanese people. 
Even U.S. State Department 
spokesman Richard Boucher 
said that the resolution runs 
counter to recent trends towards 
a warming in cross-strait rela
tions. However, the intent and 
message of the legislation is 
not as extreme as most people 
believe.
As the current superpower, the
United States acts as the police 
of the world, keeping countries 
with aggressive foreign policy 
tendencies in check. In this case, 
Washington is bound to defend 
Taiwans security in the event of 
any type of military attack from 
the mainland.
In the past two decades, China 
has slowly risen alongside the 
U.S. as the worlds next economic 
superpower. Not only does China 
have an interest in avoiding 
military conflict with the United
ously mentioned interests. Why, 
then, does the Chinese National 
Peoples Congress find it neces
sary to use such hostile wording 
in its bill?
The first reason is political. 
The wording of the bill will ap
pease the hard-liners and war 
hawks who have always main
tained that Taiwan needs to be 
reunified with the mainland, by 
use of military force if necessary. 
This concept may seem unrea
sonable, but there was a time
nation, China is attempting to 
mollify the hawkish warmongers 
in its ranks.
The second reason is strate
gic. This bill creates a specific 
set of circumstances under 
which reunification will become 
inevitable. China is betting that 
if a situation arises wherein the 
majority of Taiwan wants to de
clare independence, it will be un
able to because of the threat of 
war. In essence, China is taking 
a calculated risk that the TaiwanThe difference between the two situations is that whereas 
Lincoln was actively working toward the reuniting of a 
divided nation, China is attempting to mollify the hawkish 
warmongers in its ranks.
States, it also has a huge stake 
in maintaining its reputation 
in the eyes of the international 
community.
Launching ,a unilateral at
tack on the island would pro
voke a tremendous amount of 
criticism around the world and 
would run counter to the previthat a similar situation existed 
in the United States. Very few 
Americans would disagree with 
the decision of Lincoln going to 
war to preserve the unity of the 
country. The difference between 
the two situations is that whereas 
Lincoln was actively working to
ward the reuniting of a divided
ese government has absolutely 
no interest in formally declaring 
independence if there exists the 
possibility of provoking war in 
the process.
By authorizing the legal use of 
non-peaceful methods to en
force unification, the onus is on 
Taiwan to make the decision. The
members of the Taiwanese left
ist Democratic Progressive Party, 
which is pro-independence, will 
be stuck between a rock and a 
hard place.
Furthermore,- nou-peaceful 
means does not necessarily 
mean military action. Economic 
sanctions and blockades also fall 
under the umbrella of the term 
non-peaceful. The point is, 
China simply does not want to 
go to war with Taiwan in order 
to achieve reunification. Some
times, the implicit message of 
foreign policy measures is more 
telling than the explicit wording 
of it.
It is clear that the analysts 
who conclude that the purpose 
of the bill is for China to legally 
justify an attack on Taiwan are 
wrong. The U.S. State Depart
ment should keep a watchful eye 
on Chinese-Taiwanese relations, 
but the state of affairs is not as 
grave as one might believe.

THE TARTAN  MARCH 21, 2005An
The Tartans club sports round-up
Mens Lacrosse:
Wednesday. CMU (3) v. Grove City 
(11)
Saturday: CMU (9) v. Three Rivers 
Lacrosse (10)
CMU (13) v. Penn State - Behrend (0) 
Sunday: CMU (8) v. Slippery Rock 
(13)
The mens lacrosse team had a tough 
four-game stretch, dropping three 
of four games from last Wednesday 
through Sunday. On Wednesday, the 
team hosted Grove City, the only team 
to have beaten them in the 2004 sea
son. The Tartans never came to life 
in the game, falling behind quickly 
and dropping a 3-15 decision. Jared 
Olivenstein had two goals for the 
Tartans before leaving with an ankle 
injury.
On Saturday, the team faced 
Pittsburgh club squad Three Rivers 
Lacrosse (3RL) and Penn State 
Behrend. In the first game, the Tartans 
battled with the more experienced 
3RL team, with Naotomo Gibson scor
ing four goals in the first three quar
ters to keep the game close. Down
9-10 with under a minute to go, 
defenseman Ryan Hoqueen forced a 
key turnover near the CMU net. The 
ball was cleared up to attackman Alex 
Kneckt, who had a great opportunity 
to send the game into overtime, but
had his shot blocked with an amazing 
save by the 3RL goalie. The men's team 
lost, 9-10.
In the nightcap, the Tartans took out 
their revenge on Penn State, crushing 
them 13-0. Sophomore John Kaufman 
tallied his first collegiate point with an 
assist in the third quarter. The defen
sive combination of Hoqueen, Matt 
Shultz, and Kerem Aksoy kept Behrend 
from getting a scoring opportunity.
On Sunday, Slippery Rock traveled 
to a wet Gesling Stadium and beat 
a sloppy Tartan team, 13-8. Every 
member of the defense was called for 
a penalty at some point in the game 
and Slippery Rock capitalized on this 
advantage, scoring 10 of their 13 goals 
while Carnegie Mellon was a man 
down.
The lacrosse team has the week off, 
but will travel to play Ohio University 
on April 2.
Womens Lacrosse:
Wednesday: CMU (3) v. Grove
City(ll)
Saturday: CMU (9) v. Slippery Rock 
(3)
CMU (3) v. NYU (11)
Sunday: CMU (1) v. Toledo (8)
CMU (6) v. John Carroll (13)
The womens lacrosse club had a 
busy week. On Wednesday they
played their first game of the sea
son against Grove City. In the 11-3 
loss Alex Horton scored two goals 
and Maura Ferguson scored one. On 
offense the Tartans moved the ball 
very well but had difficulty finding 
the goal. The team struggled in transi
tion defense but Jen Singelyn and the 
defense dominated the settled play. In 
this first game of the season Elizabeth 
Ungerman played an enormous role 
on attack where she was able to show 
off her speed and skill in moving the 
ball.
This weekend the team played four 
games in a playday hosted by UPitt. 
The first game Saturday was a 9-3 win 
over Slippery Rock where Angie Kim 
scored three games in a stellar per
formance. Ferguson and Horton both 
scored two goals. Ashley Foster and 
Abiola Fasehun had one goal apiece.
In the second game of the day 
against NYU Horton had two more 
goals, one of which was the result 
of a strong weak handed drive. 
Jane Ching also scored in the 
11-3 loss. Sunday morning CMU also 
lost to Toledo eight to one. Horton 
scored the only goal the early morning 
effort.
In the final game of the playday a 
tired and injured CMU team faced John 
Carroll and put up a strong fight. In the 
13-6 loss Horton once again led the
team in scoring with two goals. Foster, 
Kim, Jess Liu and Young Choi all 
scored once, taking advantage of crisp 
passes from Ferguson.
Roller Hockey:
Thursday: CMU Tier I (4) at Duquesne 
(2)
The Tier I team started playoff action 
with a 4-2 victory over Duquesne 
Navajo to advance to next round in 
the sixteen team tournament.
Scoring summary: Pete Beutler 1 G
2 A, Mike Darragh 1 G 1 A, Adam Kahn 
1 G, Darren Makuck 1 G, Ben The 
Dude Karp 1 A.
Playoff action continues Thursday 
evening, 3/24, at RMU Island Sports

to be determined.

with a tough attitude and a scoring

when called upon. Fellow winger Ed 
Bergin may be the fastest player on 
the squad, and the Tartans will look 
to him to jump-start the offense.
Though the season was diffi

THE TARTAN  MARCH 21, 2005
Ice hockey season ends
by Brian Schmella
Junior Staffwriter
Success is an entity that can be 
measured relative to any situa
tion. At a glance, the 2004-2005 
Tartans didnt seem to embody 
success no matter how creatively 
you measured their situation. 
A seemingly promising season 
quickly deteriorated with injuries 
and other complications before 
anyone had a chance to blink. 
And though the scoreboard and 
the standings werent kind to the 
Tartans, the group of players that 
remained stuck by each other and 
looked for answers rather than 
make excuses.
The team scrapped their way to 
a 0-16-1 record, but at no point 
gave up, playing hard through
out the season despite the fact 
that the playoffs were out of the 
question. This was evidenced by 
backup goaltenders skating out 
when the team needed it, by role 
players stepping up as scorers, by 
scarcely-used players logging 30 
minutes per game, and by injured 
players skating regular shifts 
because they were still much 
healthier than others.
You have to start with the 
Tartan seniors when talking about 
the concept of a team. Eric Kidder 
once again played as a forward 
and defenseman, excelling at both 
positions. Kidder developed into a 
consistent scorer and, amazingly, 
played every game for the Tartans 
this year.
As expected, Kevin Hutchinson 
kept finding ways to score goals 
during his senior year. More 
importantly, Hutchinson fit into a 
leadership role this season, being 
a constant voice on and off the 
ice.
Fellow forward Pete Beutler 
continued his progress as a com
plete player as well, becoming 
a go-to guy for faceoffs, power 
plays, and penalty kills. He was 
also defined by his tireless backchecking. Fifth-year senior Josh 
Aisenberg was also a much-reliedon defensive forward, and he was 
always planting his big frame in 
front of the oppositions net, much 
to their dismay. Grad student Ian 
McCallum also played his last 
season with the Tartans, and he
continued to be a wily veteran on 
the blue line. And, like a brpken 
record the Tartans were tired of., 
hearing, Steve Wasik was once 
again injured early in thef sea
son, ending his erratic but solid 
career as a CMU D-man. ThOtigh 
the team will be missing tliese. 
key players, they remain optimis
tic with the talent that lies in the 
classes below them.The junior class possesses some 
of the Tartans best overall talent^ 
at every position. Goalterider Dan; 
Garmat was again a technically 
sound genius in the pipes arid a 
great example for the other young 
netminders. Defenseman D^viri 
Fell defied logic this season, play
ing at a high level dispite injuries. 
The Tartans could always count 
on Fell for big plays at both ends 
of the ice, and he scored two goals 
this season in a game in which he 
literally was playing on one leg.
Center Anthony Scolieri was 
also limited in game time this year, 
but he still found a way to rack up 
points as the Tartans number one 
playmaker. Three other juniors
- Alex Clemmens, Mike Barrella, 
and Ken Hu - continued to take 
steps forward on the front line. 
All three saw vastly increased ice 
time this season and performed 
admirably. Andrew Chen, in his 
first season playing ice hockey, 
also looks to have a bright future 
for CMU, especially when paired 
with the still developing under
classmen.
The talented sophomores are 
another reason why the Tartans 
are so optimisitic about the future. 
Forward Dan Gilmour fought 
through several injuries to put up 
good offensive numbers and con
tinue the impressive play from his 
freshman campaign. GilmOur was 
also a respected leader, even as a 
young player.
Defenseman and sophomore 
Ryan Faught was again one of the 
most feared hitters in the league 
this year. He also missed consider
able time due to injury but didnt 
miss a beat when he returned to 
the line-up. And like many oth
ers, winger Anuj Kumar saw more 
ice time than expected  but he 
took advantage of the situation 
and began to polish his game

third place in their conference; it 
also represents only the second 
tiriie that the mens basketball 
team made post-season play. The 
last time the Tartans made it to 
the post-season occurred during 
the 1976-77 season, when they 
lost to Wittenberg University in 
the opening round of the NCAA 
Division III tournament.
The skill of this years team is 
evidenced by a series of post-sea
son awards. On Monday, February
28 three Carnegie Mellon players 
were named to the All-University 
Athletic Association Team. Junior 
forwards Clayton Barlow-Wilcox 
and Nate Maurer received first 
team honors while senior guard 
Michael Divens was recognized 
as a second team honoree. In 
addition, the Tartan coaching 
staff, led by head coach Tony 
Wingen, was honored as the UAA 
Coaching Staff of the Year.
All-conference team honors 
are decided on by the coaches 
of the UAA, and it comes as no 
surprise that Barlow-Wilcox, 
Maurer, and Divens were named. 
All season, the three formed 
a dynamic trio that terrorized 
opposing defenses and led the 
team in many statistical catego
ries. Barlow-Wilcox led the team 
with 18.5 points per game, and 
was closely followed by Maurer 
and Divens who averaged 
17.3 and 14.3 points per game, 
respectively. Barlow-Wilcox also 
Contributed with a team-leading 
and UAA second-best .590 field 
goal percentage.
The Tartan three-point game 
was dominated by junior guard 
A.J. Straub, who successfully 
made 41 three pointers. In addi
tion, senior guard Eliot Goren 
was the floor general all season, 
racking up nearly four assists per 
game and setting up the offense 
from the point.
Both Maurer and Divens sur
passed a major career bench
mark this season by scoring over 
1000 points. Divens 1000th 
point came in an 86-69 win over 
Brandeis University on Sunday, 
January 9, while Maurers 1000th
point came in an 83-81 victory 
over Case Western University 
on Friday, February 4. They 
represent the 15th and 16th play
ers in Carnegie Mellon mens 
basketball history to eclipse the 
1000 point mark.
Defensively, Goren led the 
team with 46 steals and soph
omore forward/center Greg 
Gonzalez averaged a team high 
1.4 blocks while only playing 
12 minutes per game. BarlowWilcox, Divens, and Maurer led
the team in rebounding, combin
ing for 22 boards each game with 
Barlow-Wilcox doing most of his 
work on the offensive end, keep
ing key rallies alive.
Ultimately, the success attained 
by this years team will be very 
difficult for future teams to 
replicate. However, while the 
Tartans will be hurt by the loss 
of several key seniors  mainly 
backcourt starters Goren and 
Jason Walters  they still have a 
solid cadre of players to carry the
team next year. The two senior 
leaders - Barlow-Wilcox and 
Maurer - as well as a solid core 
of younger players will be looked 
on to contribute to the teams 
success next year.
Next year the Tartans will 
be contenders near the top of 
the UAA standing and there is 
the possibility that they should 
return to the postseason for a sec
ond consecutive year, with their 
sights set on the NCAA Division 
III tournament.

IM Night kicks off March Madness
INTRAMURAL, from A14
In the Womens match-up, Fresh 
Meat and Hoopers came together 
to defend their perfect 5-0 records. 
The seniors of Fresh Meat had won 
the Womens championship for three 
years prior to this face off.
The championship experi
ence of Fresh Meat showed in the
10-point lead that they amassed in 
the first minutes of the game. They 
controlled the pace with efficient ball 
movement and by taking smart shots. 
Hoopers sank into foul trouble in both 
halves, and their leading scorer, Kierra 
Wright, fouled out late in the second 
after contributing seven points.
Both halves were very 
physical and at times the officials 
appeared overwhelmed, as some 
calls went unnoticed. Fresh 
Meats Karoline Evans added
13 points to her team's victory, 
while avoiding the trend of foul 
trouble that most of the other 
high scorers faced.
The Intermediate game was fastpaced on both sides and that came 
as a surprise to anyone who had not 
seen KDR or 5526 play during the 
regular season. Contrary to most of 
the teams that come into Skibo, KDR 
showed very little difficulty in keeping 
up with the fast paced game of 5526. 
5526 had considerable trouble with 
turnovers in the first half of play, but 
after a uniform color change at halftime, they were able to move the ball 
more effectively.
Dan Mastalski of 5526 had a 
season marked with exceptional suc
cess from behind the arc. In this game, 
however, he was only able to con
vert one of his three pointers add
ing to his total of nine points. Pat 
Hagerman of KDR was five for six 
from the free throw line and scored a 
game-high 11 points on the quick plays 
that put KDR over the top of 5526.
Teammate Derek Li was always in 
foul trouble over the course of the 
season. Tonight, however, he stayed in 
the game adding a powerful presence 
and contributing nine points to his 
teams 32-24 victory over 5526.
The final game of the evening was 
between the Beta Juniors and twotime champion Beta Violators. The 
Violators came into the evenings 
match with no substitutions and miss
ing their big man Adam Miller, their

starting guard Joel McAndrew and 
Ryan Smith. The Juniors took advan
tage of the Violators lack of subs by 
breaking out into a fast pace early 
on. Despite the lack of substitutions, 
Jarrod Highberger, of the Violators, 
looked fresh from outside, hitting five 
three-pointers to add to his game high 
total of 16 points.
Ultimately, the Juniors took 
advantage of the fouls that were called 
in their favor by converting 11 of the
18 shots that they took at the line. 
The Violators, a traditionally strong 
free-throw shooting team, struggled 
from the line all night.
The best run of the evening 
for the Violators came in
the first nine minutes of the 
second half, when they went on a 
9-2 run to close within five points 
of the Juniors. The success of the 
Juniors, Jon Cakert, who had
14 points over the course of the 
evening, allowed them to once again 
break away and secure a 39-29 victory 
for their first Majors win.
The winners received free intra
mural tee-shirts and will be immoralized with pictures in Skibo Gym 
and in front of the University Center 
gymnasium.

382 points while Emory 
was at distant second at
281.5. Johns Hopkins came 
in third with 228 followed 
by Williams (191), Denison 
(170), Gustavus Adolphus 
(139), Washington, Mo. 
(119), Carnegie Mellon 
(109), MIT (103.5) and 
Wheaton (94).
Had the Tartans finished 
in eighth, it would have 
been slightly disappoint
ing given their third place 
performance at last years 
national championships. 
However, the Tartans had 
no intention of finishing 
soft.
On Saturday, the team 
was shut out of the first 
two events - the 200 
yard backstroke and the 
100 yard freestyle - but 
came on strong right after 
Hunter took eighth in the 
200 breaststroke. The bat
tle for seventh place in the 
event was a close one, and 
Hunter was edged out by 
Wisconsin - Stevens Point 
swimmer Alex Anderson
by one hundreth of a sec
ond. Pearson avenged this 
loss with a nearly twosecond victory in the 200 
butterfly, and Krzeminski 
was right with his team
mate, finishing fourth 
and propeling the team 
upwards in the standings.
This all led up to the 
teams final event of the 
competition; the 400 free
style relay. The men were 
seeded second after the 
preliminaries and fought 
with team champions 
Kenyon throughout the 
race. In the end, Kenyon 
prevailed by nearly half a 
body length, but Carnegie 
Mellon took second, earn
ing All American honors 
for Pearson, Bailey, Powell, 
and Krzeminski.
Though two events - the 
1650 yard freestyle and 
the three meter diving 
competition, - remained, 
the Tartans were done for 
the meet, finishing in sixth 
place overall, passing con
ference rival Washington 
University in the final day.
On the womens side,
junior Pavia narrowly 
missed a third place finish 
by two points, but settled 
for a personal best fourth 
place in the three meter 
dive. Both Pavia and senior 
Mindi Finnegan-Willet 
missed qualifying in the 
one meter event, placing 
10th and ninth, respec
tively.
The two divers, who led 
Carnegie Mellon to a 25th 
place finish overall, were 
the only two qualifiers for 
the national champion
ships.
Though the teams 
will graduate some out
standing performers
- namely Pearson and 
Finnegan-Willet - much 
of their talent lies in 
their underclassmen. As 
always, head coach David 
Belowich will be ready to 
mold his young swimmers 
into championship caliber 
athletes.
Despite the tough 
competition of the UAA, 
the Tartans will remain 
competitive on a national 
level for years to come.Mens tennis 3-1 in Florida

7-0 to get back on track.
The team was led by firstyear Andrew Clearfield, 
who was named the UAA 
athlete of the week after 
posting a 7-1 record in 
singles and doubles play. 
Clearfield played the 
match of the week against 
Rochesters Avinash Reddy 
to even the match up at 
3-3, staving off defeat 
for the Tartans. Despite 
dropping the first set 2-6, 
Clearfield came charging 
back and won the second 
game in extra sets, 7-5. 
With both men tired, they 
rumbled into the third set 
and played tiebreaker after 
tiebreaker in moving to an
11-11 tie. At this key point
in the game, Clearfield 
broke Reddys serve to 
take the lead and then fin
ished the Rochester player 
off on his own serve, win
ning the set 13-11 and the 
match 2-1. However, the 
Tartans failed to capitalize 
on this momentum and fell 
in doubles competition to 
give Rochester the match.
After this setback, the 
Tartans came storming 
back, only dropping a 
single set against 
Pennsylvania rival 
Haverford College and 
then taking every set 
against Ursinus the same 
day.
First-year Ryan Laws and 
sophomore Dan Munoz 
went a combined 24-0 in 
the late match after not
playing against Haverford. 
Senior Boris Sofman, 
ranked 22nd in the region 
as a singles player, had 
trouble living up to his 
ranking, losing two tough 
matches against Rochester 
and Clark.
This week, the Tartans 
will travel to Mary 
Washington University 
for matches against The 
College of New Jersey, 
Averett, and Salisbury. 
They will not return 
home until April 24 to 
face Haverford College. 
After being upended by 
Rochester, theyll look to 
sweep all three matches 
to get back on track and 
make their national rank
ing, which is currenty 
23rd, higher.

Chris Pearson continued his 
dominance in the 200_yard free
style event, winning his second 
straight NCAA title on Friday 
and then adding another title 
in the 200 butterfly event for 
good measure. He and the rest of 
the mens swimming team were 
at the NCAA Championships for 
Swimming and Diving, hosted by 
Hope College, from last Thursday 
to Saturday. The womens team

Pearson also took fifth place in 
the mens 400 yard medley relay 
along with junior Brian Hunter, 
sophomore David Krzeminski 
and junior Evan Powell with 
a time of 3:25.18. Through 
Thursdays six events, Kenyon

by Emory 138, Johns Hopkins
107.5, Denison 76, Williams 73, 
Gustavus Adolphus 69, Wheaton,

Pearson, the defending

(seeded first) again took first 
place in the 200 freestyle with 
a time of 1:38.67. Following 
this, Hunter, first-year Michael 
Bailey, senior Kevin Paavola and 
Pearson took fourth in the 800

good enough to earn the whole 
team All-American honors.

A bad ending to an amazing 
season. There is no doubt that 
the members of the Carnegie 
Mellon Universitys mens basket
ball team were disappointed with 
their last game, but they have 
to be happy with their recordbreaking performance. The team 
wrapped up their playoff run on 
Friday, March 4 with a 85-76 loss 
to Catholic University, capping 
off a team record 19 win season. 
The loss came in the semi-final 
round of the East Coast Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) Southern 
mens basketball tournament.
The Tartans finished their reg
ular season ranked second in the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA), behind the University of 
Rochester. With a regular season
record of 18-6 and a UAA record 
of 10-4, the Tartans received a 
birth in the ECAC tournament 
as the second seeded team. The 
loss, which moved the Tartans 
overall record to 19-7, came two 
days after the Tartans defeated 
Gettysburg College 66-60 in the 
first round of ECAC tournament 
play.
While the season ended in a 
loss, it will likely be regarded as 
one of the best  if not the best
 performance by a Carnegie 
Mellon mens basketball team. 
Aside from the record set with
19 total wins, this season marks 
the first time that the Tartans 
finished with a winning record 
in the UAA. Additionally, it is the 
first time that the Tartans fin

March Madness kicked into 
full swing on March 17, as IM 
Night pitted the top teams 
in the intramural basketball 
leagues against each other 
to see who would earn their 
Intramural Champions shirts. 
The 56th Annual Intramural 
Night in Skibo Gymnasium 
hosted IM Basketball 
Championship games for the 
Minors, Women, Intermediate 
and Majors[. The Minors and 
Womens games are tradition
ally officiated by student offi
cials, while professional refer
ees cover the Intermediate and 
Majors games. Keeping in line 
with NCAA March Madness, 
IM Night experienced its own 
share of upsets and close calls.
Flossies and Beta Mix faced 
off to start the evening in the 
Minors Championship game. 
Both teams entered the con
test with perfect 7-0 records. 
The Flossies had been known 
to show considerable success 
by playing a fast-paced game
balanced with exceptional 
three point shooting. Beta Mix 
had proven capable in domi
nating down low, in addition 
to their hidden ability to con
vert most of their shots from 
the field, throughout the sea
son. Unfortunately for Beta, 
they went to the free throw 
line ten times but were only 
able to hit six of the 20 shots 
that were taken. Their lead
ing scorer, Angelo Hall, hit two 
much needed three-pointers 
that both changed the pace of 
the game in favor of Beta, but 
his overall 10 points were not 
enough to ensure victory.
Sean Filipovitz of the Flossies 
went on a tear in the second 
half after going scoreless for 
the first. In addition to the 
two fast-breaks layups he 
converted, Filipovitz also 
proved to have a proficient 
jump shot. Ultimately, it was 
the Flossies success with the 
fast game that allowed them 
the necessary edge to squeak 
by with a 28-26 victory over 
Beta Mix.

Crazy clarinet cab ride
An interesting new way to experience the culture of Pittsburgh
Normally, cab drivers read newspapers while 
waiting on the curb. When I flew home from 
spring break, though, my driver had sheet 
music.
Everything was normal for the first half of my 
taxi ride back to CMU from the airport. Jazz 
music blared through the speakers of Darryl 
Canns bright yellow minivan. But something 
was different about Cann, too: he had a clarinet 
by his side, and it wasnt just for show.
Little did I know that in an attempt to have 
tourists return to Pittsburgh, the Greater 
Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau has 
been sponsoring hospitality training programs 
for taxi cab drivers. Most cab drivers are trained 
to talk up Pittsburgh with interesting facts 
and suggestions for local venues to visit. Since 
cab drivers are often the first people to greet 
tourists, the burden is on them to make a good 
first impression.
My own cab driver, however, didnt spout off 
random Pittsburgh factoids. Instead, Cann took a 
different tack: this cabbie specialized in playing 
the clarinet while driving. For emphasis, that 
bears repeating: Darryl Cann plays the clarinet 
while driving a taxi.
While I didnt have the best view of his 
performance  I was sitting directly behind him
 my companion said Cann was still looking 
through sheet music when we left the airport. 
I began to doze off a few minutes into the ride 
while we passed the monotonous Pittsburgh 
highway scene; I didnt expect anything abnormal 
to happen and let the jazz music lull me to sleep. 
But when the sounds of a clarinet blared over 
the jazz track, I definitely took notice. While 
I turned to look at my taxi companion with 
a perplexed look, she returned the look with 
wide eyes and mimed a clarinet. We sat there 
dumbfounded, not knowing how to react. Our 
cab driver was actually driving on the Pittsburgh 
highways while playing a clarinet perfectly in 
tune and in time with the jazz track playing in 
the background!
After he finished playing his first song, he 
chuckled and said, I bet you girls werent 
expecting that, were you? We shook our heads, 
of course; who expects to be serenaded while 
weaving through traffic? Cann gave us a few
laminated newspaper articles about him in local 
Pittsburgh papers before he started his second 
song. It became clear that Pittsburgh, along 
with numerous other, bigger cities in the nation, 
have been going to great lengths to push their 
cabbies into the entertainment business. Theyre 
put through hospitality training to be their citys 
ambassadors and then put out on the streets.
Although I am not a tourist, but rather a student 
who will have to return to Pittsburgh after every 
break, I am now more inclined to take a taxi 
cab back from the airport because of the fun 
experience I had listening to Cann accompany 
his jazz tracks. The cab ride was more than just 
a means of transportation: instead, it was an 
entertaining (if dangerous) way to experience 
some of the culture that Pittsburgh has to offer.
I just wonder how he keeps both hands on the 
steering wheel.

Bo-Ring!
The Ring Two drowns in its own well
In 2002, The Ring debuted in American theaters and 
became one of the top-grossing horror films of all time. 
The film, directed by industry heavyweight Gore Verbinski (who also directed the immensely popular Pirates of 
the Caribbean), was a remake of a Japanese horror film 
called Ringu, and told the story of a cursed videotape that 
would kill anyone who watched it after seven days.
Now, two and a half years later, sequelitis has hit. The 
Ring Two, which opened this past weekend, continues to 
follow Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the first films main 
character. Set six months after the events in the first film, 
Rachel and her son Aidan (David Dorfman) have moved 
to a sleepy oceanside town in Oregon, free of the tapes 
curse. The towns peace is shattered when the horrific 
murder of a teenage boy prompts Rachel to believe that 
Samara  the killer little girl from the tape  has come 
back for her and her son.
The movies plot revolves around Samaras trying to be
come corporeal by possessing Rachels son. Rachel, of 
course, is hell-bent on stopping this and returns to Sama
ras old home on Moesko Island. She tries to figure out
> exactly where Samara came from, and why shes trying to 
take Aidan away.
When it comes down to it, The Ring Two does not live up 
to its predecessor. It doesnt help that the first installment 
of The Ring is widely regarded to be in the upper echelons 
of horror/thriller movies. The interesting thing about The 
Ring is that it has very few horror elements, and most of 
the film plays out like a detective story.
So much of the movies exposition is actually brought to 
light by Rachel Keller using her journalistic instinct to 
sift through newspaper archives and medical records to 
figure out whats going on. Add that to the overbearing 
sense of dread that permeated the entire movie and you 
get a horror movie that isnt of the traditional Hollywood 
horror genre.
The Ring Two is directed by Hideo Nakata, the director of 
Ringu and Ringu 2. The storyline for The Ring Two closely 
parallels the story from Ringu 2, which makes having Na
kata direct it an interesting choice. But based on The Ring 
Two, it is clear that Nakatas style does not translate well 
into Hollywood-style films.
When a movie that so many people feel is a great film be
comes a sequel, often filmgoers will have hopes of a good 
sequel. The audience will even overlook obvious flaws, or 
rationalize those flaws with the argument that the film 
is a sequel, and sequels are never as good as the origi
nal. But the sign of a truly good sequel is a movie that can

stand on its own and doesnt rely on the tricks of the film 
that preceded it. The Ring Two is, for the most part, a dull 
film. When compared to the nerve-wracking suspense of 
the first, nothing really happens. The Ring was notable 
for many reasons, including Gore Verbinskis use of very 
slow pacing to ratchet up the tension. However, despite 
slow pacing, dull was certainly not a term to describe 
it. In contrast, The Ring Two suffers from a lack of things 
actually happening.
The first half of the film shows a lot of promise. The 
sequel picks up when the cursed tape resurfaces  it 
seems as if it has gotten quite a bit of a cult following since 
Rachel left Seattle. Rachels journalistic instinct kicks 
into gear, as does her motherly instinct to watch out for 
her sons well-being, and the possibility of the first films 
detective work appearing begin to brew. Too quickly, 
however, the focus is shifted to Aidan, who has fallen di
sastrously ill and is exhibiting symptoms of hypothermia. 
Rachel realizes that Samara is back and for some reason 
refuses to go to a hospital to help Aidan. Around the mid
point of the movie we are treated to a pair of brilliantlyrealized special effects that help make the middle third 
of the movie the strongest and most enjoyable. However, 
the film too quickly degenerates into an unoriginal and 
highly predictable possessed child flick.
Rachel goes back to Moesko Island for more answers, but 
none of the washed-out palette and sense of mystery are 
there. The same false leads Verbinski uses in The Ring are 
back: he plays on what the audience expects from hor
ror movies keep tension high without actually scaring the 
audience.
Unfortunately, the rest of the magic isnt back. The Ring 
Two falls completely flat on its face when it decides to 
create a new plot when Rachel meets Samaras biologi
cal mother in a mental institution. Evelyn, played by Sissy 
Spacek in a brief role, engages in typical, only half-com
prehensible, mental-institution chatter, but doesnt come 
off as scary or foreboding at all. In fact, Naomi Watts 
steals the scene with her almost feverish urge to discover 
the truth.
Dont expect this sequel to live up to the high standards 
set by The Ring. The movies ending alone is so completely 
out of synch with the other movie that it might spoil the 
entire experience for you. If you want a few good scares, 
especially if youre afraid of drowning, its a viable way to 
pass some time on a Friday night; however, if you need a 
cerebral, high-polish jolt, keep looking.

Soups on at Cafe du Jour
South Sides own soup feeding frenzy
Robert Kaminski/Photo Editor
Another satisfied customer leaves Cafe du Jour after indulging in one of their world-class award-winning soups.
upjjHdl0 k2 MoniC k77R0
Paul Krawiec was busy cooking in the kitchen as a hungry 
crowd milled around Carson Street in the first ever soup 
crawl to grace the city. South Side retail stores provided 
the backdrop for the contest, and 20 different restaurants 
participated in the soup-off. The day marked Pittsburghs 
first-ever South Side Mid-Winter Soup Contest, with signs 
of more on the way. Krawiec, the owner of Cafe du Jour, 
rushed to cook orders for his customers, while co-owner 
Dan Robinson patiently waited forjudges to proclaim the 
best soups in the contest.
Krawiec and Robinsons caf was just one of many res
taurants that participated in the South Side Mid-Winter 
Soup Contest. The contest collected canned goods, raised 
money for the Brasher Association food pantry, and made 
a huge success of serving broth to the masses.
up. But Krawiec, like most of the other cooks, couldnt 
taste the competition. He was too busy making it.
Krawiec, 29, looks like he should be one of the Beach Boys 
wasnt always a passionate cook. A native of California, it 
was during his undergraduate days at Berkeley that he 
first made pans sizzle.
Cooking was just one of the responsibilities shared by the 
13 people living with Krawiec in what he calls a typical 
communal house in Berkeley. His zest for cooking was 
partially inspired by his sister, who worked at the Old 
Midland Hotel, a respectable San Francisco restaurant. I 
like the theatrical feeling to cooking, says Krawiec. You 
work hard, you try to be creative. When people appreci
ate it, you feel like youve put on a good show.
Krawiec saw Robinson leave with soup and return with 
a plaque for winning runner-up in the contest, which 
now sits on the counter along with several other awards. 
If next years contest has any favorites to win another 
plaque, Krawiec and company are definitely in the run
ning.

South Sides business community took advantage of the 
cold weather by creating this unique cross-promotion. 
The result: a contest that drew choice soups from 20 
South Side restaurants in 20 South Side retail stores. 
When a hungry public gobbled all 100 gallons by the 
third hour, organizers realized that next years edition 
must demand that restaurants donate more than five gal
lons each. Thats a lot of cooking.
At the awards, top billing went to the Morning Glory Inns 
strawberry soup. The second most decorated soup was 
the 17th Street Cafs roasted red pepper bisque.
Yet the soup with the most flavor and heartiness was Cafe 
Du Jours smoked tomato, scallop, and sausage stew with 
lime crme frache, which was the judges choice runnerFor Krawiec, it was the validation of cooking like an artist 
that gave him the added drive to stretch his imagination. 
After completing his first documentary, Black Messiah, 
as a film maker at Berkeley, he found himself in a dead 
end and started his path into cooking.
After working with his sisters catering company, Krawiec 
moved with his then-girlfriend to Pittsburgh. She came 
out for medical school, he says. Unfortunately, it didnt 
work out. Now Im still here, but single.
Looking for a job, he walked Carson Street to search his 
options. It was there he stumbled onto Cafe du Jour. I 
walked in and they asked me can I cook, said Krawiec. 
I said, yeah, and he threw me an apron. I called 
home and said I wouldnt be back for a few hours... Im

sold the restaurant to cooks Robinson and Krawiec.
As for the winning soup, it was Californian in creation but 
Krawiec in every other way. The stew was created around
11 years ago by Krawiecs sister. I was sure I would hate 
this stew, says Krawiec. I was pleasantly pleased. I tried 
to recreate it in my own way. It was stuck in the back of 
my head. I have a memory for things Ive liked.

When should bands hang up the mic?
A comprehensive quiz for washed up rock stars
Having just listened to the Beastie Boys splendid 1998 
opus Hello Nasty, I got to thinking about bands longev
ity and what constitutes an appropriately extensive body 
of work. The Beasties have had a long, impressive run so 
far, and prior to last year, I speculated that perhaps they 
should cap their career off with one more classic and call 
it a day. Well, that idea yielded 2004s To the 5 Boroughs, 
a record that I thought was okay. Yet, like many, I was a 
little disappointed by it. So much for leaving em wanting 
more. This ongoing example raises a much larger issue, 
one relevant to any artist who has achieved the sort of 
success through which they can routinely swim around 
in a pool filled with gold coins: When is it time to ride off 
into the sunset?
I recently read an article in Spin in which U2s Bono said 
that if his band ever puts out two straight bad records, 
theyll stop. I like the damage-control nature of this 
policy, but I am not as smitten with the idea that some 
loyal fans will be plunking down $30 for second-rate U2 
albums before Bono pulls the plug. Imagining their ver
sion of Machina: The Machines of God makes me shiver. 
No, I think that the issue is more complex and that a num
ber of factors should be carefully weighed before reach
ing a decision. Fortunately, I have devised a foolproof test 
that veteran bands should take before heading back into 
the recording studio.
The Should we Make Another Record? 
Test (SMART)
1. Have you been playing together for over 40 years?
 If yes, are you the Rolling Stones?
-If you are, skip to the next question.
-If you are not, then please, please, please stop trying. 
Its not going to work out.
 If no, please continue with the test.
2. Did you recently follow up a successful first album with 
a nearly identical second one?
 If yes, were both well received?
-If they were, then you are the Strokes, and may 
carry on.
-If they were not, you are Andrew W.K. and should 
consider washing your pants.
 If no, then you can advance.
3. Are you Beck?
 If yes, skip to the end of the test  youve got too many 
ideas to be reading this article anyway. You can even skip 
the eccentric genius question.
 If no, continue with the next item.
4. Are you Axl Rose?
 If yes, keep doing whatever it is youre doing so I can 
continue to mock you in this column every week. In par
ticular, keep the dreadlocks.
 If no, please move to the next question.
5. Are you a rapper?
 If yes, do you have more than two classic albums? (Note: 
you probably dont.)
-If you do, then hello, Public Enemy or Jay-Z! Con
tinue resting on your laurels and collecting praise 
indefinitely. It worked for Run-DMC.
-If you do not, then at least think about it for a 
minute. Look in the mirror and say, Am I a sucker 
MC? Be honest with yourself, rhyme-slinger.
 If no, then go on to the next question. Actually, theres 
no way a rapper would ever take this test  MCs never 
stop kicking it unless theyre killed in a geography-related ^ 
feud or until they are way past their prime.
6. Are you a troubled, reclusive, misunderstood, or eccen
tric genius?
 Well, I hope that works out for you. At least try to get 
some sun.
7. Are you in a band which has been very successful, had 
a big flop last time out, and is looking to make that come
back record?
 If you are, then definitely give it a try. You can take the 
Californication approach and forge a new sound for your 
band, or the Chronic2001 approach where you recapture 
what made you big in the first place. Either way, youve 
got nothing to lose after that awful thing you put out last 
time. Did you think people were going to like that?
 If you are not, then good for you. Keep your fingers 
crossed, and move on.
8. Are you a classic and/or legendary rock group reunit
ing after a considerable hiatus?
 If yes, are you the Pixies?
-If you are, get on with it before Im old. Skip to the 
next question.
 If you are not, then why bother? You and I both know 
whats drawing people to your shows, and its not the

promise of new Motley Criie material.
 Also, if yes, do you have more than 66 percent of the 
original lineup, including the most significant frontman? 
Youd better.
 If no, then we can both breathe a sigh of relief. Next 
question.
9. Do you have strong, idealistic, youthful political 
views?
 If yes, so what? At least use some clever metaphors if
you really have to get something off your chest.
 If no, write about science fiction or other cool rock 
topics, not about chicks or your parents.
10. If you intend to do one or more of the following things 
with your next release, I strongly urge you to reconsider 
your career path before completing this test:
 Make an experimental disc. Look at what happened 
to Radiohead; even rock critics dont pretend to like them 
anymore.
 Alienate your audience with an uncommercial, difficultto-listen-to album. Nirvana ended up okay with In Utero 
because they were too good to make anything not worth 
listening to, but you will likely be all too successful.
 Avoid rocking despite a proven ability to do so. You have 
to rock, at least some. Its part of the contract.
Well, Mr. or Mrs. Successful Artist, if youve come this 
far, you seem to be well-qualified to continue your career. 
Perhaps one day you will end up in one of those awful 
jam sessions at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction 
where roughly 55 people play lead guitar at once. Truly 
the epitome of the rebellious rock 'n' roll spirit. But first, 
you must answer one last question:
11. Do you still like playing (and not just because of the 
cocaine)?
 If yes, then keep on truckin.
 If no, wanna trade jobs?

then both brothers fall in love with 
the woman who caused the car crash
 except now shes had both her legs 
amputated. To complicate matters, the 
brothers find themselves more and 
more obsessed with death, and once 
their new love interest dies, theyre not 
sure where to turn. Im going to take a 
stab and say this movie doesnt involve 
zombies, though the premise sounds 
like it could seriously use some.

Fraternities and sororities compete in Greek Sing
Traditional music show raises money for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society
If youve been on Facebook recently, you may have seen 
advertisements for Greek Sing. Most likely you saw 
the little tri-fold advertisements on the tables in the 
University Center or the various posters for Greek Sing 
all over campus, too. With all the hype surrounding 
Greek Sing, hopefully you got the chance to see fraternity 
brothers and sorority sisters perform in Greek Sing on 
Saturday night.

Greek Sing provided the opportunity for fraternities and sororities to collaborate on musical segments. The event raised money 
for multiple sclerosis research.
This year, the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall on Fifth 
Avenue was host to Carnegie Mellon Universitys 90- 
year-old tradition of Greek Sing. That tradition is one of 
philanthropy, friendliness, and high-energy competition 
that brings fraternities and sororities under one roof to 
perform condensed versions of various musicals. Erin 
Weber, a senior and Greek Sing president, was proud of 
the people who put so much effort into this years showing: 
Its a strong showing of the Carnegie Mellon community 
in general, she said, [and] the thoughtfulness and 
community service that students participate in. This 
year, over $10,000 in proceeds from the event benefited 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Allegheny District 
Chapter, which was selected by Greek Sing chairs earlier' 
y in the academic year.
After selecting a beneficiary for this year, which in 
the past has included breast cancer awareness groups 
and childrens homes, Greek chapters raised money to

and Sailors Memorial Hall.
finance their performances. The judging for the actual 
performances  the 13 minutes that culminated months 
of hard work  was based on difficulty, energy, and 
entertainment in the required music, choreography, and 
production.
Greek Sing began in 1915 as a fundraising event in which 
the Greek chapters simply sang songs. The tradition has 
evolved from song, to song and dance, to abbreviated 
Broadway musical, and even has MCs introducing each 
performance nowadays. Some fraternities and sororities 
paired up and performed in what has been named the 
Doubles Division, while others went solo and competed 
in the Singles Division. Everyone who came out to cheer 
on their friends in the fraternities and sororities screamed 
loudly and clapped constantly in support. This years 
performances included Footloose, Peter Pan, Hairspray, 
Pippin, A Chorus Line, and Wild Party, as well as an 
introductory performance from Musical Theatre seniors 
and an awesome closing step-dance performance by the 
non-competing fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi.
The first act, in which Kappa Alpha Theta, Sigma Phi 
Epsilon, Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Phi 
Kappa Theta performed, suffered due to sound problems 
but managed to entertain the audience nonetheless. 
Kappa Alpha Theta and Sigma Phi Epsilons Footloose 
brought energy to the house immediately with a strong 
performance of the song Footloose; and a comical, 
all-male interpretation of Peter Pan followed (it doesnt 
get much more entertaining than seeing a football 
player dressed as Tinkerbell). Hairspray also wowed the 
audience with their sets, which included upright beds
and cutouts in the scenery filled with live actors.
Act Two benefited from a correction in the sound, and 
was filled with strong performances. Pippin had the 
most interesting costumes, which glowed white in the 
black-lighting effects; the performance of A Chorus Line 
was the least chaotic, most organized on stage and won 
first place in the Singles Division. Delta Gamma and 
Kappa Delta Rho performed Wild Party. Wild Party was 
visually organized and had the best music and dance 
synchronization and the most confidence.
Each skit had varying levels of complexity. One skit 
included basket tosses, done by the dancers in Footloose; 
others had point dancing, a notoriously hard and 
painful type of dance, as seen in A Chorus Line. The cast 
of Hairspray had interesting costuming ideas, which 
involved flipping skirts inside out to create an entirely 
new outfit.
After the performances, the audience held its breath as 
the judges announced the winners: Delta Delta Delta won 
the Singles Division and Delta Gamma and Kappa Delta 
Rho won the Doubles Division. Then, Weber presented 
a check to the representative from the National MS 
Society. This was, perhaps, the most satisfying part of 
all the fraternities and sororities night. As Weber had 
said earlier about the final donation: Its a really proud 
moment for the entire community and for whom were 
raising the money.

Acceptances Phantoms album features trite tracks
A few good beats dont disguise redundant lyrics
If youre looking for fun and peppy punk rock that sounds 
like Simple Plan, Blink-182, or Sum 41, Acceptance 
falls far short of the mark. With its origins in Seattle, 
Washington, the band has opened for Juliana Theory, 
Yellowcard, and Further Seems Forever. Their first fulllength album, titled Phantoms, is scheduled for release 
on April 26.
The bands debut album features 11 tracks exploring 
the theme of love, as well as an instrumental piece cut 
into the middle. Phantoms definitely has a few winning 
tracks, such as Different and Gloria/Us Appearing, 
which seem promising as they showcase the bands 
creativity and their ability to move away from pop 
cultures definition of punk rock. The tamer Gloria/ 
Us Appearing highlights the bands eclectic range of 
musical talent, while simultaneously offering listeners a 
unique play on words.
However, the rest of the album seems lacking in 
originality, as the listener hears familiar beats and tones 
surprisingly like those of Blink-182 and Good Charlotte. 
With the bands added flourishes in unnatural places and 
all-too-sudden changes in tempo dynamics, it becomes 
difficult for the listener to fully appreciate the bands 
talent amidst all the tawdriness.
Repetition may be yet another reason for the albums 
lack of appeal. To put it simply, the lines from this album 
are unnecessary and distracting. While repetition is 
key to many popular songs, it is overdone in Phantoms 
to the point where the album seemed to be an audio 
version of Andy Warhols famous Campbells soup cans. 
Aside from the overdone repetition and sudden tempo 
changes, Phantoms has a diverse collection of lyrics. 
From describing the crazy sensations of being in a 
relationship (Youre the only one I would take a shot on/
Keep me hanging on so contagiously), to the more bitter 
implications of love (Shes a liar/It comes to this), the 
band gives listeners a comprehensive sampling of what 
love is.
Altogether, Phantoms lacks the quality of Coldplay 
or Juliana Theory. Acceptance has the usual punk/ 
alternative beats and the punk rock lyrics to complement 
them, but perhaps the band can use a little bit more 
creativity to invent rather than embellish. Get rid of the 
awkward tempo changes, throw out the repetitiveness, 
and a copy of Phantoms might be worth more than half a 
jar of marbles.

Spring flings: Top 10 things to do in Pittsburgh
Where to go to enjoy some of the most wonderful spots around Pittsburgh this season
Picnic perfect: Point State Park
In such a crowded cement-clad city, Pittsburgh residents 
can find sanctuary in the beautiful Point State Park. The 
park is nestled next to the Fort Pitt Bridge in downtown 
Pittsburgh and is maintained by the Pennsylvania 
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Only 
a 20-minute drive from the Carnegie Mellon campus, the 
park is the perfect way to spend a spring day.
located at the foot of the river, which sprays water over 
100 feet into the air and can be easily seen by motorists 
on the Fort Pitt Bridge.
Picturesque Pittsburgh: A view from the top
As the rickety door slams shut and the cable car begins 
its slow ascent from the bottom of Duquesne Heights, 
you wont be able to take enough pictures of Pittsburgh. 
Fortunately, the cable cars creep along at a slow enough 
pace that there is plenty of time for both photography 
and enjoying the view of the city on your own. While the 
cable-car ride itself might be childish, the view from the 
observatory deck of the Duquesne Incline is magnificent: 
downtown Pittsburgh becomes breathtaking, especially 
at night. Already over 100 years old, the Duquesne 
Incline has been a tourist attraction and a Pittsburgh 
gem for many years. Originally one of many inclines built 
to transport the coal workers to Coal Hill in Mount 
Washington, the inclines now serve a greater purpose: 
taking tourists up to the beautiful town of Mount 
Washington, Pennsylvania. In addition to the incredible 
view in Mount Washington, the area is home to some of 
the tastiest restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, including 
the Monterey Bay Fish Groto Restaurant, Pasquarellis 
Restaurant, and Le Mont Restaurant. Visitors can come 
for the view, but stay for the food.
Ancient wonders: The Museum of Natural History 
brings history to life
Just down the street from our beloved CMU campus is a 
true gem of scientific and entertainment value. Free with
Greg Prichard/Comics Editor
An outside view of Wrights Fallingwater house.
After a harsh winter spent bundled up inside stuffy 
dormitory rooms, made even longer by a Groundhog 
Day prediction of six additional weeks of winter, 
Carnegie Mellon University students will finally have the 
opportunity to stretch their legs and explore Pittsburgh 
this spring. Before students pack up and go back to their 
summer internships, jobs, and hometowns, there are 
some must-see events, exhibits, and places that students 
should take advantage of and which are worth the time to 
visit. Whether youre an art enthusiast, Pittsburgh native, 
or thrill-seeking student, these events offer something 
for everyone.
Worth the trip: Frank Lloyd Wrights Fallingwater
Although it is a few hours from the immediate Pittsburgh 
area, Frank Lloyd Wrights Fallingwater mansion is well 
worth the drive. The architectural masterpiece, nestled 
in the woods of southwestern Pennsylvania over Bear 
Run Creek, was constructed between 1936 and 1939 for 
the Kaufmann family of Pittsburgh.
The main appeal of the home is its harmonious setting: 
the house is literally mounted on top of a Bear Run 
Creek waterfall. Wright skillfully incorporated many 
aspects of nature into the home, such as a glass panel 
on the first floor with stairs that lead directly down into 
the creek. The home is lit mainly by natural sunlight, 
which enters from the large windows and open balconies 
found throughout the house. Seemingly miles away from 
anything manmade, the mansion is remarkably quiet and 
serene.
Despite its rustic setting, the home was furnished with 
original Wright furniture pieces, classic art by Picasso, 
and home decor from Tiffanys. The home, art, and 
furniture have remained in excellent condition thanks 
to the efforts of the Western Pennsylvania Conservatory. 
Fallingwater can be toured Tuesday through Sunday 
from 10 am to 4 pm. Regular tours for adults cost $13 
during the week and $15 on the weekend. For additional 
information or to reserve tickets, call 724.329.8501.

Patrons at the Museum of Natural History are transported to 
prehistoric times by the dinosaur exhibits.
For history buffs, Point State Park offers a look into the 
founding of Pittsburgh. The park houses three bastions 
(defensive fortifications) for visitors to tour: the Music 
Bastion, the Monongahela Bastion, and the Flag Bastion. 
The interesting history of Point State Park, which was 
of particular importance during the French and Indian 
War for its optimal location near the junction of the 
Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela rivers, is told by the 
numerous monuments and plaques dispersed throughout 
the 36-acre grounds. The park features a bicycling and 
skating path that connects the North Shore Trail, South 
Side Trail, and Eliza Furnace Trail.
Perhaps the parks most beautiful spot is its fountain,

The Japanese room at the Cathedral of Learning. Some of the rooms are used as classrooms.
a CMU ID, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is 
filled will fact and legend, dating back to prehistoric times
? through exhibits displaying precious minerals, dinosaurs, 
and the ways of ancient peoples.
The museum houses exhibits illustrating the development 
of mankind: most notably, the Egyptians and the Native 
Americans. The Egyptian exhibit shows what researchers 
have been able to piece together of the ancient civilization 
that once existed along the Nile River. Likewise, the 
Native American exhibit carefully displays the ways of 
life of different Native American cultures from all over 
the continent, including the Iroquois of the Northeast, 
the Hopi of the Southwest, and the Inuit of the far north.
The most majestic exhibit of all, though, is the dinosaur 
exhibit. Though it is currently under renovation, visitors 
to the museum can watch as the dinosaur skeletons are 
disarticulated  that is, taken apart bone by bone. The 
renovation will be completed in 2007, marking the 100th 
anniversary of Dinosaur Hall.
The world a step away: The Nationality Rooms at the 
Cathedral of Learning
The Nationality Rooms at the Cathedral of Learning 
should be easy to find for Carnegie Mellon students. 
Located within the University of Pittsburghs most famous 
and visible structure, the rooms are only a ten-minute 
walk away from the CMU campus (and thats going 
slowly). The rooms, which have been there since 1938, 
have continued to expand and change over the years. 
They began when members of different nationalities
made suggestions on how the rooms could be themed 
to reflect the diverse Pittsburgh community. There are 
eight finished rooms in the third floor of the Cathedral, 
including rooms representing Africa, Japan, and Austria. 
The bulk of the rooms, however, are located on the 
first floor, which houses 18 rooms  a large portion of 
which reflect the nationalities of some of Pittsburghs 
earliest settlers, including the Czechoslovakians, Italians, 
and Polish. Each room is decorated in the style of the 
nationality it represents. Today, many of these rooms are 
used by lucky Pitt students as classrooms.
The Nationality Rooms may be toured for a mere three 
dollars from 9 am until 2:30 pm on all weekdays and on 
Saturdays. On Sundays and holidays the tours take place 
from 11 am to 2:30 pm, and they can be completed in 
just an hour or two for the busy student. They are also 
so close and so affordable that there is no excuse for not 
taking a Saturday afternoon tour and seeing some of the 
interesting collections that Pitt graciously displays.
Station Square provides shopping, comedy, and 
cuisine
Just a quick bus ride from the Carnegie Mellon campus, 
Station Square is one of the best shopping and dining 
experiences available in Pittsburgh. The shops, which are 
located alongside the majestic Monongahela River, range 
greatly in price. Inside the shopping center are one-of-akind shops and boutiques that sell everything from fine 
tobacco to specialty soaps and gourmet candy.
After a long day of shopping, you can enjoy the large variety
of restaurants at Station Square, such as Hard Rock Caf, 
the Cheese Cellar, and Joes Crab Shack. Reservations 
are not required but are highly recommended, especially 
on the weekends when the area is busiest. If the wait for 
the restaurants is too long to bear, you can sit outside the 
main courtyard and enjoy the beautiful water show that 
is put on hourly at the base of the river. Just a short stroll 
from the restaurants and shops is the historic Pittsburgh 
station on the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad. While 
watching the trains pass, you can look out onto the river 
as cargo ships and cruise boats pass along the river.
After you enjoy dinner, you can venture to the Funny Bone 
comedy club, located directly across from the Hard Rock 
Caf. The Pittsburgh Funny Bone club, which was the first 
Funny Bone to open nationwide, brings performers such 
as Tammy Pascatelli and John Heffron (both from the hit 
show Last Comic Standing) to Pittsburgh. Tickets sell out 
quickly, so be sure to make reservations!
Psychedelic Sensation: The Laser Show at the Carnegie 
Science Center
A favorite of the creatively minded everywhere is the 
occasional trip to a laser show. The laser show costs eight 
dollars for your first show, and any additional tickets to 
later shows in the same evening cost five dollars. It is 
worth the price for the unusual experience of viewing

on the cover.
Finally, for the over-21 crowd, the Strip District is noted 
to light up the evening time with a wide variety of clubs 
and bars. Bring a designated driver, please!
The meat lovers palace: Fatheads
Fatheads is perhaps the single most accessible and 
worthwhile place for the Oakland-area college student 
to get red meat. A ride on the 64C will drop you within a 
few blocks of Fatheads, but you need to walk back to the 
bus stop after eating at Fatheads. Although they do card 
at the door after 10 pm, for those lucky students over 21, 
Fatheads serves up an expensive but eclectic array of 
beers. But even for those under 21, this is a valuable stop 
before late night: you wont leave hungry.
The list of gourmet burgers alone totals over 25, with 
varieties featuring interesting ingredients like asparagus 
and, on another burger, small bits of fried onion. The 
fried pierogies, though not a health food, are truly 
Pittsburghian, with a golden brown color that is nearly 
impossible to achieve at home.
Fatheads has the simple ambience of an old brick 
house, which adds to the terrible acoustics. Noise aside, 
however, its great food. Where else can you purchase 
a meal lovingly called The Artery Clogger, which 
features slices of ham, two fried eggs, and a large mound 
of cheese?

this laser show. The seating in the show places patrons 
nearly horizontal, with an enormous planetarium screen 
above. Currently the Carnegie Science Center is featuring 
music on the hour: family hour at 7, Rush at 8, Creed at
9, No Doubt at 10, selections from The Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, Stone Temple Pilots, Bush, and Live at 11, and 
the traditional midnight Pink Floyd show.
The Science Centers laser show has a great sound system 
that plays the music so loud you can feel it, though perhaps 
not during family hour. Rather than computer-generated 
lasering, the technicians control all of the lasers, though 
the timing and some of the designs are done ahead of 
time. If youre willing to take two buses or can hitch a 
ride from a buddy, this is a great experience  if only 
to see how a few lasers can really enhance your favorite 
music. For once, when youre not engaged in homework, 
view the wild lines of color and the very colorful crowd 
found at the Carnegie Science Center Laser Show.
The Carnegie Science Center, located at 1 Allegheny 
Avenue very near to Heinz field, features a seasonally 
changing schedule of laser shows that run from seven 
until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. The Science 
Center is easily accessible via the 500 on weekends. From 
the stop you can take either the 16D or the 16U to the 
Science Center, or take a ten-minute walk.
Consume your gloom: The Strip District
The average student ignores the Strip District, located just 
east of downtown Pittsburgh  and its his loss. Anyone 
who complains of a lack of variety in food choices in the 
area can meet his solution in the Strip. To get the most out 
of the Strip District, travelers should go on Saturday and 
try to arrive early. Youll know why when you get there: 
On Saturdays, the farmers market takes over the Strip.
Market-style vendors and restaurants in the strip include
a lot of ethnic foods such as the Italian tasties at Sunseri, 
Mexican and South American foods, and unusual 
beverages. On market days, many more ethnic food 
vendors set up shop on the street than in the buildings. 
For the coastal dwellers stuck in Pennsylvania for the 
next four years, Wholeys (pronounced Woollys) might 
be a place that will bring back the memory of decent 
seafood. The style of the restaurant is very casual, but the 
fish is some of the best in the area. There is also a marketstyle area of Wholeys that sells produce, sushi, and  for 
those with a kitchen  fresh fish.
The Strip doesnt have to ruin your diet, either. Street 
vendors selling knockoff shoes and sunglasses abound, 
and there are more interesting vendors that sell 
Pittsburgh art and knick-knacks. There are also assorted 
novelty and comic shops, plus a great music shop called 
Eides. The Strip is also only a short walk from the 
Senator Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center, which 
includes, among more practical exhibits on history, an 
area devoted to pickles.
The vegans Eden: Maggies Mercantile
John Davin/Photo Staff
Some of the outdoor markets in the Strip District feature discount-priced shoes, handbags, and sunglasses.
Now that the health-conscious are sick with the caloric 
debauchery of Fatheads, we can move on to much milder, 
more healthful fare. Because the writers this week were 
not vegans, we decided to poll a few, and not one failed to 
mention Maggies Mercantile, reviewed in these pages by

Did Yinz Know that About the Burgh?
Basic Burgh Info 
Population: 334,563 
Founded In:1758
Size: 13th largest city in the United States
Interesting Facts about Pittsburgh
1. The city is home to the longest-running television 
program on PBS, Mister RogersNeighborhood, which first 
aired in the United States in 1968 and still airs reruns 
today. Check PBS if you dont believe it!
2. Bored on a Friday night? Thanks to Hugh Ward, a 
native of Pittsburgh, you can turn to the high-intensity 
game of bingo for entertainment.
3. Pittsburgh is second only to San Francisco for having 
the most hills, which makes driving in the winter all the 
more pleasant.
4. Who needs to work out when there are 712 sets of stairs 
in Pittsburgh? Thats 24,108 feet of climbing fun.
5. Scott Fahlman, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon 
University, was the first person to design an emoticon: the 
smiley face we all know and use all too frequently:-).
6. Not to confuse anyone trying to drive, but there are 
over 900 bridges in the greater Pittsburgh area, and they 
look a lot alike.
7. Still not bananas about the Burgh? The first banana 
split was created near Pittsburgh, in Latrobe, Pa., in 1904 
by optometrist David Stridden

on Atwood Street in Oakland has some mock meats 
which are better than the real thing. Their desserts, 
including vegan cakes and soy ice cream, are equally 
impressive, said Eric Jonas, a member of the local 
chapter of PETA. The desserts from Maggies can also 
be found at the University Center, in Skibo  but go 
to the restaurant and avoid your temptation to stay on 
campus.
Some last words
With spring in the air and summer on your minds, 
Carnegie Mellon students should go out and visit the 
restaurants, events, shows, and exhibits available to 
them. If you only get to do a few of them, you will at least 
have gotten to see a side of the city that you otherwise 
might not have gotten to see. So get out there and begin 
exploring Pittsburgh!

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
The Caribbean! announced Carlow. You need to go on a 
relaxing cruise! Wilbur was immediately entranced. Of course!
A Caribbean cruise! Thats perfect! Images of white sand and ^ ^ 
cerulean waters danced in his head. Soon, though, more practical o 
concerns came to Wilburs mind. Carlow, I havent mentioned this, 
but Im limited on the amount I can spend on this vacation. Carlow gave Wilbur a 
knowing smile, revealing a golden incisor. No worries, my boy! Its the off-season! 
Prices drop dramatically on the already good deals that I get for my clients. Carlow 
leaned over his desk, raising his hefty backside slightly out of his chair, which emitted 
a creak from the release of pressure. You know how I get these deals, Wilbur? 
Wilbur shook his head, partly to remove his nose from the stream of bad smells 
coming out of Carlows mouth. I know the captain. He and I were Navy buddies! 
Carlow grinned proudly as he rolled up his sleeve to show off a large, faded tattoo.

HOROSCOPES.
_________________________________
BY ASHLEIGH MOLZ
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Finally today, your social skills will kick back 
in. Its been a long time.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): If you are in a relationship, you need to have 
a talk with your partner. Open lines of communication are paramount, but 
dont expect too much. If you're single, you need to find someone. Just dont 
call your old flame again. Theres a reason why (s)he never calls back.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): That dream youve been having, the really 
crazy vivid one that takes place on the Andromeda with everyone singing and 
begging you to be first lieutenant? Its going to come true today.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): I know youre thinking about taking on a big 
project to impress your professor, but do you really have the time? I mean, 
how are your grades? Be honest with yourself.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): This coming weekend, youre going to spend way 
too much time with your roommate. And everything that can go wrong will. 
No matter what happens, keep in mind that he is your friend, and whatever 
you do, don't make mama jokes!
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Stay far away from that place on 
campus that sells the food that really isnt good for you. You know which 
one. You will get heart failure this time, not just that sharp pain in your 
arm.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): You have no future.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): You will have major problems with 
communication and travel for the next week. Dont go on any trips, and 
unless you want to lose friends, dont talk to anyone. On the bright side, you 
can just hole up and get all that work done that youve been postponing. Or 
play The Sims until your mind breaks. Whichever.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): If youre going to a party 
today, dont forget to bring the plastic utensils and napkins  you promised. 
And dont leave the directions at home; it will be hard to get there. If you 
aren't going to a party, forget it.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Youre not stingy  dont let 
anyone tell you that you are. Youre just reasonable. So what if you dont 
see the point in spending money on new shoes? The ones you have are just 
fine. In fact, the holes in the soles lend them character.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): If you feel like crap lately, blame 
Jupiter  its really messing everything up for you, having been in your 
house for the past week. I dont know when it will leave you alone, but suck 
it up. It happens to the best of us.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Youre going to be offered a chance to 
go on a wonderful vacation to a place youve always dreamed of visiting. 
Dont go.

Comickaze
The uncertain state of newspaper comics
Cathy has gotten married. The For Better or For Worse 
characters have become grandparents. Peanuts 
is repeating strips first printed in the early 70s. 
What have todays newspaper comics become? Are 
originality and creative ideas really dead in this great 
medium? Leave it to a big-nosed penguin from the 
past named Opus to bring some stability to the future 
of this ever-changing world.
When Berkeley Breathed announced the return of 
his immortal character in 2003, many were skeptical. 
His wildly popular 1980s comic Bloom County, which 
introduced Opus, was an adult-themed Reagan-era 
comic. Its political commentary was like Doonesbury 
with more colorful characters, such as Opus and Bill 
the demented cat. Bloom County ended amidst much 
sadness from its countless fans, but Breathed, never 
one to stay still for very long, returned with Outland, 
a comic that was disappointing to some because it 
was almost identical to Bloom County. Outland was 
short-lived, and many thought that Opus and Bill had 
Breathed their last.
Its no wonder that fans were skeptical when Opus 
debuted in November 2003. The drawing style 
was sketchier, the coloring looked like it could be 
computer-generated, and Breathed no longer signed 
his name backwards in the lower right corner of the 
strip. Whats more, the comic was to appear only on 
Sundays. One upside: Breathed was given the rare 
opportunity to draw the comic in a large format, a 
trend that Calvin & Hobbes' Bill Watterson started 
when he demanded it of his syndicate in the early 
90s.
So how has Opus stood up to Breatheds previous 
classics? Most of the original characters have come 
back or at least made cameos (luckily Bill the Cat is 
now a regular), and the political atmosphere is back 
with commentaries on blogs, Condi Rice, and other 
things. Fortunately, the satire that Bloom County 
gave to Reagan politics meshes perfectly with todays 
political climate. It also doesnt hurt that most 
newspapers in the country put Opus on their front 
pages from the very beginning, anticipating greatness. 
Its a good sign that over a year later, Opus has kept its 
front page prominence in every paper Ive seen.
What about the other comics out there today? As I 
mentioned, long-time bachelorette and every woman 
Cathy blasphemously got married amid drawnout preparations and the characters annoyingly 
repetitious angst. Is this drastic turn in the comics 
plot a betrayal of the single, independent women 
who made Cathy a star? Well, you can only talk about 
chocolate and trying on bathing suits so much.
Patrick McDonnells acclaimed Mutts has become 
almost unbearably preachy lately. The whimsical 
world of Mooch the cat and Earl the dog was fun to 
read back when the comic began, but one can take 
only so many Shelter Stories about pets waiting 
for adoption. McDonnell has done great things for 
animal rights and adoption causes, thats for sure. But 
instead of dwelling on these issues in comics, I would 
like to see the Mutts go on more adventures like they 
used to.
If theres one constant in newspaper comics, it is 
Prince Valiant. Longtime artist and writer John 
Cullen Murphy died last year, but it was taken over 
immediately and reproduced in precisely the same 
style that it has retained for nearly 70 years. Very few 
people still read Prince Valiant, but its comforting to 
see that some things really dont change. After all, Val 
himself hasnt aged much since 1937.
The future of the newspaper comic medium is 
uncertain. While Opus and other new comics are 
getting attention, readership is waning, and many old 
strips are experiencing creative stagnation. We are far 
from the golden years of our childhood, when Foxtrot 
and Calvin & Hobbes were the in comics. Opus is a 
step in the right direction; its just the combination 
of creativity and nostalgia that comics readers need. 
As far as I can see, theres only one thing which can 
cement the mediums future. Think about it: What if 
Calvin & Hobbes Bill Watterson were to take a page 
out of Breatheds book and make a triumphant return, 
either with a completely new idea or a Calvin spin-off? 
Imagine the possibilities, for example, of a teenage 
Calvin. You know you would read it, and so would the 
entire country. But dont get your hopes up.
