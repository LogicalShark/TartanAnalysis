Honorary 
To Tutor 
This Week
Tau Beta Pi Plan 
Includes Courses 
In Technical Fiel
Tau Beta Pi is opening its pro
gram of free tutoring this week. It 
has long been a tradition for Tau 
Beta Pi to conduct such tutoring 
classes, but this year the scope of 
the program has been greatly ex
panded.
In this program Tau Beta Pi se
lects capable undergraduates from 
its own members and from other 
honor and professional societies to 
conduct the classes. It is the aim 
of these classes to help all of the 
Underclassmen who are having 
scholastic difficulties in their fun
damental English and Science 
courses, and are willing to put 
some effort into their work. It is 
hoped that this tutoring will pro
vide the underclassmen with an 
opportunity to eleminate some of 
their difficulties.
Tau Beta Pi does not intend to 
supplant regular channels of as
sistance available to students 
it hopes to suppliment them by 
giving the student seeking help a 
chance to get it informally.
It is also hoped that a series of 
slide rule lectures will soon be 
given with the assistance of Pi Mu 
Epsilon and the Math department. 
These lectures will be designed to 
teach the students a little more 
about the use of the slide rule.
For further information about 
tutoring refer to the schedule ap
pearing on the last page of the 
Tartan. Then watch for additions 
or changes in future issues. A 
regular schedule will be printed 
each week.

Book Review 
To Be Given 
In Assembly
Former CIT Professor 
Writes Religious Study
Dr. Max Schoen, former head 
of the psychology department, will 
review his book, The Man Jesus 
Was, at the assembly on Tuesday, 
October 19, at 11:30 a.m.
After he retired from Carnegie in 
1948, Dr. Schoen lectured a year 
at Dartmouth college and has 
spent two years as lecturer at 
Hamilton college in New York. His 
reputation as an interesting speak
er made his classes the most pop
ular among the students.
Dr. Schoen is recognized in the 
United States, not only as an out
standing writer, but also as a re
searcher in the field of aesthetics, 
ethics, and religion. He has writ
ten several religious books.
He came to Carnegie in 1921 as 
an assistant professor and four 
years later became a full profes
sor. In 1937 he was appointed as 
head of the department of psychol
ogy and education.
Council Powerless To Control 
Homecoming Celebrations
Horsch Resigns To Simplify Technicalities;
Class Organization Reports More Progress
Giving up his status as Carnegies first Student Council repre
sentative from the graduate school, Bob Horsch resigned last Wed
nesday in order to simplify matters.
Councilmen found themselves powerless in trying to handle 
Homecoming functions, since the#
administration has scheduled 
everything, including an offcampus dance on Saturday.
Could Stay On
Horsch tendered his resignation 
on the condition that he have 
charge of the new public address 
system in the gym, which was his 
main responsibility as chairman 
of Councils permanent decora
tions committee. Although it is 
possible to find technicalities in 
the organizations setup -that 
would allow certain graduate stu
dents to be Council members, he 
felt the present situation would 
be simplified through his action.
New Council
Class organization committee 
chairman Dolly Mitchell reported 
further progress in the forming 
of a general council of class offi
cers. The group will consist of 
the president of each class, a 
chairman from Council, and two 
other student members. Capel 
McCutcheon and Don Baeder were 
chosen to help with this project.
The main function of the new 
group will be to unite the various 
class organizations. Junior class 
president Wes Apple expressed 
confidence in the plan. Dick Ro
man, sophomore prexy, was not 
present at the meeting. Apple re
ceived permission to fill by ap
pointment the vacancy in the Fine 
Arts vice-presidency.
The meeting closed following a 
discussion concerning Smollens 
proposal that ID cards be made 
transferable tickets to all games. 
The issue was let ride pending 
further investigation and consul
tation with the athletic committee.
Since Homecoming this year 
will be tied in with the inaugura
tion of President Warner, the cost 
of practically the entirjg event will 
be supported by the school. The 
student dance will be held Sat
urday, October 28, at the William 
Penn hotel following an alumni 
banquet there. Admission will be 
$2.50 of which $2.00 will go to 
the school. The remainder, from

Three Way Celebration 
Highlights Homecoming
Semi-Formal Planned Off Campus j 
But Price Is Lowest In History
The biggest Homecoming celebration in Carnegies history is 
well on its way to becoming a reality as student committees in 
charge of various events during the three-day celebration begin to
?formulate their plans.
Bigger and better student events
Campus Chest 
Begins Drive
Plans Made To Raise 
Student Contributions
The Campus Chest committee 
met last week with school of
ficials to discuss plans for a big
ger and better chest program this 
year. Plans call for the drive to 
be held on November 1-3, with 
major campus organizations par
ticipating.
Various methods have been ad
vanced to raise the student con
tributions to a level comparable 
with those of the faculty. Personal 
interviews with students living on 
campus, and as many commuters 
as possible, may be used by the 
committee during the three day 
campaign.
All major campus organizations 
will be polled to determine the 
participating charities share of the 
total contributions. All charities 
included in the drive will be pro
hibited from soliciting separate 
donations at other times.
The committee includes Leonard 
Smollen, general chairman; Paul 
Stettler, publicity chairman; Leon
ard Huzdos, entertainment chair
man; Nancy McDougal, secretary, 
and Dick Lyman, solicitations 
chairman.
School officials directly concern
ed with the drive include Dr. Min
or, Dr. Graham, and Dean David.
32 Countries 
Represented 
At Carnegie
Latest figures from the Regis
trars office show 32 foreign coun
tries are represented at Carnegie 
Tech this year. The International 
club has greeted the students from 
these countries with two social 
gatherings to date and many more 
planned.
The International club is an or
ganization designed primarily to 
give foreign students an active so
cial program, but it is open to all 
interested students from the Unit
ed States as well. Thus it enables 
students from the variouse coun
tries to become acquainted with 
each other as well as with the 
countries of other people.
Besides their activities with the 
International club, the foreign stu
dents will also be entertained at 
many private homes. If any of the 
faculty would like to entertain 
some of these students, please no
tify Mr. Rollin V. Davis, Box 124, 
CIT or to Nancy Sitler, 2354 Bensonia Ave., Pittsburgh 16.
The countries represented are 
listed as follows: Argentina, Aus
tria, Brazil, Canada, China, Co
lumbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Domin
ican Republic, San Salvador, 
South Wales, England, Ethiopia, 
Finland, France, Greece, India, 
Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaya, Mex
ico, Guatemala, Norway, Panama, 
Philippine Islands, Netherlands, 
Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, 
and Venezuela.
during the three-way program 
which will celebrate Carnegies 
fiftieth anniversary, the inaugura
tion of Dr. J. C. Warner, and the 
annual Homecoming have been 
promised by the various alumni, 
administration, and student com
mittees.
The student committees are as 
follows: general chairman, Ruby 
Weisberg; coordination, Betty 
Asche and Bob Kubiak; registra
tion, Frances Hamborsky; aca
demic procession, Patsy Saibel; 
dedication of college of engineer
ing addition, Don Culler; dedica
tion of Morewood Garden dining 
room, Mary Jo Carraher; Carnegie 
Day exercises, Capel McCutcheon;
Due to a typographical error 
in last weeks issue of the 
Tartan, student tickets for the 
1950 Homecoming-50th Anni
versary dance at the William 
Penn were listed as selling 
for $2.00. This should have 
read $2.50.
Activities
The names of all officers of 
campus organizations and ac
tivities should be turned into 
the Dean of Students office as 
soon as possible in order to be 
included in the Activities Di
rectory.
Candidates For Queen 
To Be Chosen Soon
Freshmen women from nine departments will meet next week 
to select their nominees for Homecoming Queen. The system of se
lecting women from departments instead of through commuters and 
dorm residents, initiated last year, succeeded in providing a better 
representation of freshman wo-#-----------------------------------------------------
men.
The number of candidates to 
be chosen from each department 
was decided by the percentile 
system. The largest freshman 
class, home economics, has three, 
and all others have one with the 
exception of general science, so
cial work, and architecture, which 
will only have one candidate for 
the three departments.
The all-school election, at 
which both men and women may 
vote, will be held on Tuesday, 
October 24. The nominations and
election is being conducted by 
Cwens, sophomore womens hon
orary.
The 209 freshmen women, who 
will choose the queen candidates 
from among themselves, are urged 
to attend the meeting of their re
spective groups at the time and 
place listed in the schedule below:

A Duty And A Privilege
Two weeks from today, freshmen will be called upon 
to elect their class officers for the coming year. Two years 
ago, class organization was non-exisent on Carnegies cam
pus. Two years ago, also, school spirit was practically non
existent at CIT. Freshmen were allowed to drift aimlessly 
into school and departmental affiliations that segregated them 
from the rest of their classmates.
The re-initiation of class organization at Carnegie, less 
than two years ago, was brought about as a possible solution to 
the general apathy of both the students body and the alumni.
It was hoped that separate class organizations and officers would 
serve not only to stimulate school spirit and class consciousness, 
but also to increase interest and activity among future alumni 
groups.
Much time has been spent in developing and perfect
ing the class organization program since it was first pro
posed. In return, all th^t is asked of freshmen is coopera
tion. Cooperation in three waysin the nomination stage, 
at the polls, and after their representatives take office.
If you feel that one of your classmates has the necessary 
abilities to make a good class leader, organize a group and push 
the nomination and election of this person. Petitions are now 
available in the Dean of Student s office, and must be returned 
with the required signatures by Friday of this week.
The purpose for which class organization is set up, and 
the benefits it offersboth to the group and the individual 
makes it a dtuy and a privilege for every freshman to sup
port the coming elections all the way.
In Rebuttal
The Poor Physicist who wrote the letter in last weeks 
Tartan, showing concern over the evident absence of the 
student body in plans for celebrating this years three-way 
homecoming program, may rest at ease.
The only explanation to the seemingly-apparent absence of 
students from this year's fall carnival is that student committees 
have just begun to formulate their plan, and publicity in the 
Tartan is just commencing with this issue. On the other hand, 
administrative and alumni committees had all summer to work 
out their plans.
However, in future issues, student plans will be out
lined as the biggest fall celebration in Carnegies history, for 
both students and alumni, begins to take shape. On the front 
page of this issue, the student committees set up for the 
handling of the students part at homecoming are listed.
Good Follow-Through
A Little Louder. Please!/
We sat in amazement at last Saturdays game and watch
ed and listened to the pitiful Tartan cheering section. Cer
tainly, we thought, there are enough in attendance at this 
game to supply more vocal backing to the footballs team 
attack.
The cheerleaders, although they could stand more practice, 
were also present in abundance. However, there seemed to be 
no unity among the various sections in the stands, and little if 
any cooperation with the cheer leaders.
Weve heard many suggestions as to what is neded to 
remedy this situation: get better cheers, get one cheerleader 
with a portable loudspeaker, and make all the freshmen sit 
together.
The second suggestion struck us as being the most practical. 
One cheerleader who could be heard above the entire chorus 
of nine cheerleaders would get far better results than the present 
system.
We would like to see this system in use for one Satur
day. Equip the head cheerleader with a portable loudspeaker 
and give everyone in the stands a chance to follow the cheer
ing before it is half completed.

Letters
Student Blasts 
FPHA Dorms
Editor, the Tartan:
As a student now living in the 
FPHA barracks, I was greatly in
terested by the article in last 
weeks paper describing the ex
pensive construction program re
cently completed at Morewood 
Gardens. Why is it that the school 
administration is willing to spend 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
provide luxurious lounge areas 
and interdorm telephones for the 
women students instead of using 
this money to provide decent ac
comodations for the male dorm 
students?
The barracks are deadly fire 
traps: I have heard the statement 
that it would take only seven min
utes for the whole structure to be
come a raging holocaust. The 
walls between the rooms are pa
per thin, and we run the con
tinual risk of putting our fist into 
our neighbors face. At some ends 
of the barracks there are no steps, 
only vertical wooden ladders.
The thin walls are totally inef
fective in holding down the noise 
level of the dormthus making it 
doubly hard to concentrate on 
ones studies. If you decide to give 
up and seek a little relaxation in 
the recreation room, you again 
draw a blank, for the facilities, if 
you can call them that, are in a 
sad, sad way.
. Its hard enough to get heat in 
the winter time; but once you do 
get it, you are liable to sweat and 
swear, for there are no means of 
heat control in individual rooms. 
There is hot water in only one 
out of every two wash bowls, and 
the shower facilities are almost as 
bad as in the Army.
I have waited patiently for some 
indignant outburst from one of our 
highly touted campus leaders or 
from one of those organizations 
unselfishly devoted to the welfare 
of the students; but since most of 
these entities seem to be more con
cerned with the phrasing of some 
obscure line in some equally ob
scure constitution, I thought I had 
better do it myself.
Not that I xpect anything to be 
actually done about the problem 
by any campus organization, but at 
least Student Council can form a 
committee which can write a re
port about the problem which can 
then be filed away like Wes Ken
neys Skibo project.
Sincerely yours,
The Gleep.
Gantz Wins 
New Masthead 
Competition
A sophomore P&D student, Car
rol Gantz, submitted the winning 
entry in the Tartans flaghead de
sign contest. Gantzs entry will be 
used as the Tartan flaghead and 
mast head for the remainder of 
this school year.
Second place in the contest went 
to Elmer Veres, a sophomore arch
itecture student. The contest was 
judged on the grounds of original
ity, adaptibility of design to Tar
tan format, and ease in reading.
By Dolly Mitchell
PLAID MAD . . . The Tartan team 
did not wear their sharp new 
football uniforms of white and 
plaid last Saturday because Davis 
& Elkins didnt get their road uni
forms in time for the game. Since 
both teams cannot wear the same 
colors, our football players must 
wait until this Saturday to sport 
their plaid and white uniforms. 
THE GOOD OLD DAYS . . . When 
the staff members of WRCT were 
cleaning up the Union basement, 
where the* stations . studio is lo
cated, they took out heating venti
lators that had not been used since 
the school acquired Carnegie 
Union. And guess what they fouijd 
wedged behind those ventilators? 
It was a scoreboard from a Car
negie Tech-Notre Dame game! But 
those days are gone forever.
OUR MOTTO . . . The motto on 
the official seal of our college, My 
heart is in the work, is a quota
tion taken from a letter that An
drew Carnegie wrote to the city of 
Pittsburgh in 1900 when he estab
lished Tech.
TALKY-TALKINK TALK ... If
any talkative students are look
ing for part-time employment, go 
to the Dean of Mens office. A 
woman called the campus employ
ment bureau and asked for two 
boys to be conversationalists.
A HOT TIME . . . Who says we 
havent got a red-hot team this 
year? The spark of the teams en
thusiasm surely must have caused 
the fire in the first floor grand
stand of Forbes Field last Satur
day.
THE PRESIDENT . . . The inaug
uration of President Warner dur
ing Homecoming is an innovation 
on Carnegie campus. He will be 
the first president of the college to 
be officially installed in a formal 
inauguration ceremony.
HAVE YOU TRIED HADACOL? 
. . . Cold germs have just about 
taken over the campus. The num
ber of students who are sniffling 
and sneezing is so large that it

To Inform Public
In a special meeting of the Tar

promulgating our escteric cogita

ble or psychological observations, 
we would beware of platitudinous 
ponderosity.
We decided that our commun

and concatenated cogency.
We shall attempt to eschew all 
conglomerations of flatulent gar

We shall sedulously avoid all 
polysyllabic profundity, pompous 
prolixity, psittaceous vacuity, ventriloquial verbasity, and vaniloquent vapidity.
In keeping with our policy, dou

and pestiferous profanity, obscur

Above all we wont use big words.

Harold Wells, junior: Drama
^are
the hair style and c lothing of fav
orite actors. As a group they seem 
much friendlier toward each other 
than other departmental groups 
are. Perhaps this is because the 
type of work they do brings them 
together.
Mary King:,
sophomore:
Some of the 
dramats are un
usual, but not 
all of them are.
We notice the 
ones that dress 
to extremes, but 
we dont notice 
the ones that 
dress like the 
rest of the kids. I know a few 
dramats and I like them very 
much; some of their views are ec
centric, though. I think they are 
living their careers in every day 
life. They are a close unit group 
because they are a minority.
Walt Wagner, sophomore:  Dra
in a t s have a

titude of uncon
cern toward at
tracting public attention so that 
they can adjust to the attention 
theyll receive on the stage. I 
have never had much contact with 
dramats, but I think that a lot of 
them are serious about their work. 
Some of them just fool around; 
and that happens in every group.
Sally Walker, junior: I think 
that some of 
the dramats are e x a g g erated, 
but the reason 
for it is that it 
is a field of exp r e s sion, and 
they almost 
have to carry it 
over into every 
day life. I dont 
think they are 
odd. Im in Fine Arts and I see 
them rehearsing. It seems odd to 
us because were not dramats our
selves. We cant understand them; 
thats the whole thing in a nut 
shell.
Fritz Wilson, junior: Dramats 
^aV^6 ^ ^ COm~
' way!" All 'the
dramats arent unusual, but we
only notice the ones that are dra
matic. Its just like the belief that 
sailors are drunken. If five sailors 
are walking down the street and 
one of them is drunk, people will 
say, There goes a bunch of those 
drunken sailors.
Next week, drama students wil 
explain why they believe that peo
ple class them as being different 
than other college student*.

fading back from his own 32, hit 
Luchok with a pass on the 35, and 
Johnny outran the D&E secondary 
for the touchdown. Gil Dissen's

Bethany Bisons Combine Single-Wing Offense 
With Passing Attack; Decker Standout Back
On Saturday Coach Eddie Baker will send his Tartan cleaters 
against Bethany in an attempt to cop tneir second victory. Fresh 
from their win over D&E, the Plaid will encounter a single-wing 
passing offense when they take the field against the Bisons.
Their coach, Glenn Johnson, has 
a veteran team to work with, but 
there is a distinct lack of depth in

Emanon Impressive In Lopsided Victory; 
Passing Accounts For Majority Of Scoring
Intramural football finished its first week of league competition 
with 14 of the 22 teams seeing action. Four leagues have been 
formed to handle the squads. The Tartan and Skibo leagues con
tain six teams each while the Kiltie and Scottie leagues have only 
five in their ranks. ?
The first day of competition 
found Theta Xi downing the Citcom Clan by a 25 to 22 count. TX 
was trailing at the half, but Art 
Christopher caught a Clan passer 
behind the goal line for a safety 
and the tide began to turn. Bill 
Oxley, Dick Lynch, and Pete An

Tartan Lineman Of The Week
Herman Whitenight has been 
named as the Tartan Lineman of 
the Week. Although his playing 
was restricted to defense, Whitenight proved to be the most steady 
and dependable man on the squad.
With Coach Bakers proteges us
ing a five-man defensive line, it 
Qwas Whitenight who blocked the 
center of the line as D&Es backs 
constantly attempted to gain yard
age on line plunges.
Although the transfer P&D from 
Michigan State is only a sopho
more, he has shown a type of de
fensive play that fits in well with 
the Plaid style of game.
It was mainly through Whitenights efforts that the opponents 
were limited to only 66 yards on 
rushing, while the Tartan backs 
were able to amass a total of 154 
yards.
The chunky 180 lb. guard has 
been touted by Coach Baker as one 
f his chief hopes for the year as a 
defensive lineman.

FORPKIUP MORRIS
The usual happy shouts and cheers of victory were no
ticeably absent in the Carnegie dressing room following last 
Saturdays win over Davis and Elkins. Naturally the Plaid 
gridders were tired; it had been a long afternoon. However, 
this wasnt the prime reason for their lack of enthusiasm. 
Rather, they knew they had made too many mistakes, mis
takes that could cost them a victory against a more formid
able opponent.
Certainly they were happy to have finished on the long 
end of the score. They had expressed a great deal of confi
dence prior to the game that they had a winning team, 
and had lived-up to their promises. However, they also 
knew that they had plenty to learn before they could con
sider themselves a polished gridiron machine.
Of course, the visitors had furnished much stiffer opposi
tion than anyone had supposed they would. The Senators were 
definitely out to upset the favored Tartans and came danger
ously close to doing just that. It goes without saying that Dr. 
Bakers boys would have been satisfied with an easier opponent 
for their opening game.
Many of the .mistakes made by the Skibos were obvious
ly due to overanxiousness, particularly on the part of those 
who were filling their first starting assignments. Tackling 
was especially poor and downfield blocking could stand im
provement. Pass defense, though much better than it had 
been, will have to improve even more if the Plaid intends 
to outscore their opponents.
There was, however, one phase of football in which the 
Tartans could hardly hope to better themselves. The spirit and 
hustle shown by each member of the team, whether he was 
playing or sitting on the bench, was downright tremendous. It 
is doubtful whether a football team could be found that can 
equal the 1950 Carnegie in regard to spirit. Throughout most of 
the game the shouts from the Tartan bench could be heard above 
the poise of the spectators. Although complimentary to the team, 
this certainly points-up the continued lack of spirit on the part 
of the students.
The team will, without a doubt, correct their mistakes 
in regard to football but will the students correct their lack
adaisical attitude in regard to the team?
WAA Starts

New Rules
Plans Are To Set Up 
Intramural Program 
In Several Activities
The Womens Athletic Associa
tion is beginning its second year 
under a new constitution. The 
club system has been inaugurated 
with a sports club being formed in 
each athletic activity where there 
is sufficient interest. The members 
of the various clubs elect repre
sentatives to the WAA board. Per
manent members of the board and 
officers are elected in the spring of 
the year for the coming year. Miss 
Dorothy Kanrich of the womens 
physical education department 
serves as sponsor for the associa
tion, while Miss Shirley OMara 
and Miss Ruth Bush coach the 
various teams.
The aim of the WAA board is to 
set up an extensive intramural 
program in bowling, volleyball, 
basketball, and hockey. Interested 
women are urged to watch the 
Tartan for notices concerning or

Sigma Delta Phi fraternity will

square dancing and prizes for the 
best costume. George would like 
to have the members of the fra

Page edited by Evening School Students of the Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology.Due to popular demand, Evening Student Council is inaugurat
ing its evening school social calendar with a good old fashion square 
dance. On hand to assure a successful affair will be Pittsburghs ace 
dance caller, Si Braley, and his hoedown orchestra. Si did the call
ing at the October and February square dances last year. He has 
a knack of instructing the dancers so that the novice as well as the
experienced dancer has plenty of
 ... .   fun.
The dance will be held in This
tle Hall Saturday evening, Octo
ber 21. The admission will be 75 
cents per person, and the dance 
will begin at 8:45 p. m.
Tickets can be purchased from 
any evening student council mem
ber or from Dal McKelway, Even
ing School Registrar, in Room IH 
132A. If unable to contact any of 
these people, tickets can be bought
at the door.
We would like to mention that 
jeans, overalls, and plaid shirts 
will fit the occasion. For those 
who will be attending a square 
dance for the first time, the social 
committee advises getting to the 
dance early so as not to miss any 
of the fun or instructions.
