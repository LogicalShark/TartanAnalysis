Senate denies funding for Shabazz
Kierra Wright, a senior in chemical engineering, and Joe Trotter, the history 
department head, were proponents of bringing New Black Panther leader 
Malik Zulu Shabazz to campus for Black History Month.
by Alexandra Kilduff
News Editor
Last Thursday, Student 
Senates weekly meeting in the 
McKenna/Peter/Wright room 
was filled to near capacity. The 
cause of this unusual attention 
was a number of proposals for 
Funding and Recognition, and 
in particular a proposal for a 
$2000 honorarium to bring a 
controversial speaker to campus: 
Malik Zulu Shabazz, the national 
chairman of the New Black Pan
ther Party.
According to Kierra Wright, a 
senior in chemical engineering 
who presented the proposal to
Student Senate, Shabazz would 
be speaking as part of the Black 
History Month program in Feb
ruary. His discussion was to fo
cus on black history dating back 
to ancient Egypt, and also on 
the role and responsibility of 
black college students. Wright 
also added that there would be a 
discussion floor open to all. 
Shabazz, an attorney and 
graduate of Howard Univer
sity in Washington, D.C., came 
to chair the New Black Panther 
Party for Self-Defense after the 
death of its leader Khalid Abdul 
Muhammad in 2001. He lectures 
extensively and has also founded 
Unity Nation, a student group at 
Howard University.
Shabazz has gained notori
ety over the past decade as an 
outspoken anti-Semite. During 
a news conference held at the 
National Press Club, Shabazz 
was quoted as saying, We have 
to make it plain that Zionists 
control America lock, stock, and 
barrel. The European Jews have 
America under control, lock, 
stock, and barrel  the media, 
foreign policy.
This point was brought to the 
meetings attention by Joseph 
Arasin, a computer science and 
history major and Student Sena
tor. Does bringing a speaker with 
this sort of motivation promote 
the sort of cultural awareness, 
the togetherness that you seem 
to be trying to achieve with this 
event? Arasin asked after read
ing quotations from Shabazzs 
previous speeches.
I feel it is our right as stu
dents, Wright responded, that 
if there is an interest among one, 
or fifty, or ten, or however many 
students there are, we should re
spect that wish of the students to 
hear the speaker that they want 
to hear. Wright added that stu
dents were welcome to protest or 
challenge Shabazzs speech and 
views in the events open forum.
Also in attendance at the meet
ing, at the request of student body 
president Erik Michaels-Ober, 
was history department head Joe 
Trotter. I normally dont get in
volved in trying to sway student 
bodies, said Trotter. However, 
he did stress that he felt Shabazz 
would represent an interesting 
viewpoint. This man, said Trot
ter, is not about representing 
the black community, but about 
giving students an opportunity 
to hear another opinion in the 
African-American community. 
He added that he felt students 
would be able to form their own 
opinions. I doubt that this man 
can come here and talk to a stu
dent body at Carnegie Mellon 
that would be very passive about 
what he has to say.
As the debate continued for 
over an hour, many students 
admitted that they knew little 
about Shabazz or his views. 
Daniel Papasian, a junior social 
and decision sciences major, 
then requested speaking rights 
and proceeded to read both an

Asian-interest 
Greek groups 
grow at CMU
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
As students of a school that 
prides itself on cultural diversity 
and awareness, members of Asianinterest Greek organizations want 
their peers to be aware of where 
they stand.
Sometimes it looks like were 
Asian and were a separate Greek 
community. Thats not the case. 
Were part of the whole Greek 
community. There shouldnt be 
a division, said junior business 
major Jea Suh, the president of Pi 
Delta Psi, a Greek fraternity which 
centers on promoting awareness 
of Asian culture.
Currently there are four Asianinterest Greek organizations on 
campus. Pi Delta Psi and Lambda 
Phi Epsilon are fraternities, and 
Kappa Phi Lambda and alpha 
Kappa Delta Phi are sororities. Pi 
Delta Psi, initiated in December 
2001, was the first Asian-inter
est Greek community on campus, 
and it has since attained chapter 
status. The other three organiza
tions, still relatively new, are con
sidered colonies and are work
ing toward becoming chapters.

Sony president,CMU 
alumnus unveil QRIO
Todd Kozuki, a CMU alum and employee of Sony, is one of two people in the 
nation with access to the QRIO robot, Sonys two-year old bipedal robot.
by Alexander Meseguer
Layout Manager
Two and a half feet of elec
tronics do not usually capture 
the attention of toddlers and 
parents alike. Last Friday, how
ever, QRIO, Sonys two-year-old 
humanoid robot, did just that.
Sony came to Carnegie Mellon 
last week, offering two demon
strations of QRIO to standingroom-only crowds in Rangos 
Ballroom. A pair of QRIOs drew 
upon a repertoire of boy-band 
moves and pelvic thrusts to per
form a series of Latin, Arabian, 
Japanese, and American pop 
dances. They elicited smiles and 
chuckles from the crowd as the 
pair also danced The Robot. 
They even showed off their abil
ity to speak in a mock conver
sation with Todd Kozuki, their 
demonstrator and Carnegie 
Mellon alum.
Kozuki: So QRIO, how are
you enjoying your first visit to 
Pittsburgh so far?
QRIO: Im freezing.
QRIO: I cannot wait to see a 
Primanti Bros, sandwich and a 
side of O fries.
Kozuki: That was definitely 
one of my favorite meals while I 
was a student here at CMU. 
During the question-andanswer period, audience 
members were intent on exploringthe robots humanoid aspects. 
One student asked Hideki Komiyama, Sony Electronics presi
dent and chief operating officer, 
if Sony had any plans to make 
QRIO taller so it could recognize 
faces more easily. Komiyamas 
response was simple: It doesnt 
grow, he said, laughing.
As the robots were removed 
from the stage, the audience 
cooed at their noisy reactions to 
being held or touched. Kozuki 
later explained that these noises

Ali Abuminah to speak 
on Palestinian question
by Marshall Roy
Staffwriter
This Thursday, well-known 
media analyst Ali Abunimah 
will speak at Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Pitts
burgh. Abunimah, co-founder 
of the Electronic Intifada 
(www. electroni cin tifada.net) 
and vice-president of the ArabAmerican Action Network, will 
speak at 4:30 pm in the Adam
son Wing of Baker Hall. Hosted 
by the Pittsburgh Palestine Soli
darity Committee, his speech is 
titled Palestine/Israel: An End 
to a Century of Conflict?
A renowned public speaker, 
Abunimah has appeared on CSPAN, the BBC, CNN, and MS
NBC, and his articles have been 
published by the Chicago Tri
bune, the Los Angeles Times, and 
The New York Times.
According to its website, the 
Electronic Intifada (El) is a non
profit, independent publication 
committed to comprehensive 
public education on the question 
of Palestine, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the economic, 
political, legal, and human di
mensions of Israels 37-year oc
cupation of Palestinian territo
ries. 
According to Hanadie Yousef, 
a first-year chemistry major 
and the president of Carnegie 
Mellons Arab Student Organi
zation, It is very important for
any campus, especially one such 
as CMU with people from all 
over the country and world, to 
host political speakers like Mr. 
Abunimah whose views on in
ternational affairs might differ 
from what is routinely expressed 
in the American media.
The money the U.S. gives to 
Israel comes out of our pock
ets, and it is important for us to 
know where it is going and how 
it is being spent, and whether 
such support is moral and righ
teous, Yousef stated.
The website also states that 
Abunimahs Electronic Intifada 
publication is not in the posi
tion to replace or act as substi
tutes for large media organiza
tions such as the BBC or The New 
York Times.
Carnegie Mellons ethnically 
and religiously diverse campus 
has been host to many speakers 
and presentations in the recent 
past which pertain to the conflict 
in the Middle East; Abunimahs 
visit is only part of a series of 
events which highlight the inter
national focus of CMU.
Nader Shakir, vice-president 
of Carnegie Mellons Muslim Stu
dent Association and sophomore 
Science and Humanities Scholar, 
supports Abunimahs attempt to 
supplement mainstream media 
with independent reporting and 
analysis. Everybody has a bias, 
said Shakir, so its important to 
get information from as many 
views as possible.
WRCT program expanding to West Virginia station
Matt loups, a senior computer science and history major, hosts the WRCT 
political program Rustbelt Radio. The program is expanding to a second 
broadcast point in West Virginia.
by Geetika Bhandari
Junior Staffwriter
Starting this semester, one 
of WRCTs political programs, 
Rustbelt Radio, will be chang
ing its schedule from biweekly 
to weekly. Originally a biweekly 
program, this grassroots community-based show will air live every 
Monday from 6 to 7 pm. Rust
belt Radio will also be broadcast 
on WVJW-Benwood 94.1 FM, a 
radio station in Wheeling, West 
Virginia, with coverage spanning 
beyond Shadyside, Ohio, every 
Saturday from 5 to 6 pm.
Were expanding ... because 
weve got an opportunity to col
laborate with another indepen
dent community radio station 
there and try to broaden our 
scope to cover the surrounding 
area of Pittsburgh, stated Matt 
Toups, a senior computer science 
and history major who hosts the 
program. He is also the public af
fairs director for WRCT.
The show features four rotat
ing hosts  Toups, Andalusia 
Knoll, Quinten Steenhuis, and 
Gwen Schmidt  and is open 
to participation from volunteers 
as it is collaboratively produced 
with the Pittsburgh Independent 
Media Center. In describing the 
essence of the show, Steenhuis 
stated, We record events that are 
interesting and get them on the 
radio as quickly as possible. Ac
cording to the press release from 
WRCT 88.3 FM, Rustbelt Radio 
addresses international, national, 
and local issues.
Some people at WRCT have 
called Rustbelt a news magazine 
to set it apart from other talk-oriented public affairs shows, said 
Toups. This is one point we feel 
strongly about; we arent just an
other political talk show.
WRCT general manager and 
senior mathematical sciencesmajor David Messinger said that 
the station initially approved 
Rustbelt Radio because they 
presented the PA [public affairs] 
director with a solid concept for 
a show. In general, we try to pro
vide resources and information 
that cannot be heard elsewhere 
in Pittsburgh. Most of our PA 
shows are dedicated to raising 
local awareness of national issues 
not being covered by the big news 
organizations with political ties 
and concerns. This is possible at 
WRCT because the station gives 
its individual DJs autonomy in 
making the radio stations pro
gramming decisions.
The Pacifica Radio Foundation, 
which is the fastest-growing net
work of independent radio sta
tions in the nation, includes both 
WRCT and WVJW. It was through 
the Pacifica network that WVJW 
was first introduced to the Rust
belt Radio show.
WVJW 94.1, The Voice of Dis
sent, schedules a variety of pro
grams during its weekend air
time, such as Guns + Butter and 
Cultural Baggage, as well as 
music programs for a majority of 
its airtime during the week.

Michaels-Ober
Diversity makes our university better. 
One of the ways it does this is by forcing 
us to consider opinions and lifestyles that 
are unfamiliar to us and may even make 
|us uncomfortable. These new situations 
present opportunities for personal growth 
but they unfortunately may also lead to 
hostility toward those who are different 
than us.
The vision statement for the Diversity 
Advisory Council states that Carnegie 
Mellon will be a university where all 
members of our community feel a 
sense of belonging, perceive that their 
contributions are valued and respected, 
and view the environment as one in 
which they can flourish. The SafeZone 
program seeks to fulfill part of this
vision by building a network of allies 
of those going through issues of gender 
identity and sexual orientation. These 
allies identify themselves through the 
easily recognizable SafeZone symbol that 
declares a space to be safe and supportive 
for people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual 
or transgender. SafeZone ensures that 
members of the GLBT community know 
that there are people with whom they can 
safely discuss personal problems without 
facing discrimination in any possible 
form.
To join this network, all you have to do 
is fill out a short application and attend a 
three-hour training session. I participated 
in one of these sessions last semester and 
now proudly display a SafeZone sticker 
on the door of my office on the third 
floor of the University Center. The next 
session will be held on Sunday, February 
13, and is open to all members of the
campus community. The application 
for this session is available on the web 
at www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/soho/ 
szapp.html and is due by next Monday, 
February 7. All applications should be 
turned in to Rowshan Palmer in Student 
Affairs, Warner Hall 301, or by e-mail to 
rowshan @andrew. emu. edu.
SafeZone members agree to maintain 
confidentiality, use inclusive language, 
and avoid stereotyping, thereby 
reducing homophobia, biphobia, and 
heterosexism on our campus. Even 
if you do not participate in SafeZone 
training, it is important to treat all 
members of the campus community 
with dignity and respect. We should 
embrace our differences and value our 
diversity. Harassment and intolerance are 
unacceptable in any form.
Students with issues of gender 
identity or sexual orientation can also
visit SoHo, Carnegie Mellons Resource 
Center for GLBT Concerns, located in 
room 234 of the Old Student Center. For 
more information about SoHo, e-mail 
soho@andrew. cm u.edu.
ALLIES is a student organization that is 
composed entirely of people that support 
the GLBT community. In honor of National 
Freedom to Marry Day on February 12, 
the organization is currently collecting 
photographs and stories for an upcoming 
exhibit about what it means to be a family 
at Carnegie Mellon. If you would like 
to share your family  whether it be

family group, broadly defined  e-mail

Executive
Privilege
/ Bradford Yankiver
Content published in last weeks 
issue of The Tartan  a cartoon by 
Ryan Maloney titled Spring Clean
ing and an editorial by Alexander 
Su questioning the rationale for affir
mative action  elicited a significant 
volume of feedback from a variety of 
perspectives. In the interest of trans
parency and our perpetual mission of 
facilitating constructive discussion, I 
wish to discuss the cartoon and the 
complexity of the editorial process. 
As The Tartans Executive Officer, I 
am in the leadership position for the 
organization, but weekly editorial 
decisions are the responsibility of 
Editor-in-Chief J.T. Trollman.
Alexander Sus editorial moti
vated our readers to share their per
spective with the community; their 
letters can be read in Forum. In this 
way, The Tartan acted as a vehicle 
for dialogue  a minor victory.
We have also received a variety of 
feedback about Ryan Maloneys car
toon, both directly and through The 
Tartans ombudsman, Kristina Wiltsee. Some called it hilarious satire, 
and others said it was derogatory 
and degrading. It is important to 
recognize the full spectrum of opin
ions; the existence of highly polar
ized opinions indicates to me that 
the issues raised by the comic are 
unresolved in this community.
We received two letters to the edi
tor regarding the cartoon, both neg
ative. The author of the first asked 
that we not publish the letter. A sec
ond letter, composed by Tim Bowen, 
the president of Sigma Nu, can be 
found in Forum, page A6.
The comic underwent the normal 
procedure for approval  it was 
viewed by at least two editors and 
three other members of the staff. The 
cartoon was identified as controver
sial in nature through that process; 
Comics Editor Greg Prichard and 
Editor-in-Chief J.T. Trollman decid
ed that the comics satirical nature 
overshadowed its potential to cause 
harm.
Our organization aspires to pub
lish a newspaper that offers enter
tainment, educates our readers, and, 
most importantly, creates construc
tive discussion within the commu
nity. To that end, our editorial staff 
must navigate a thin line. They must 
distinguish between content that 
challenges our readers to rethink 
and reassess their beliefs and con
tent that is libelous or injurious.
The editorial staff is responsible 
for presenting something other than 
conventional wisdom. Controversial 
content will cause people to feel in
secure, frustrated, and offended. We 
cannot shy away from that. When I 
doubt my beliefs, feel confused as to 
why others dont share my views, or 
am upset by the opinions of others, 
I am forced to think in new ways. 
Sometimes, I revise my standpoint; 
sometimes, my original notions are 
reinforced. In either case, my under
standing of the issue is enhanced.
This newspapers editorial policy 
on controversial content should par
allel CMUs policy on controversial 
speakers. The Universitys policy 
states: If [students] are to learn to 
choose wisely, they must know what 
the choices are; and they must learn 
in an environment where no idea 
is unthinkable and where no alter
native is withheld from their con
sideration. The University affirms 
that controversial speakers will be 
permitted not because they have a 
right to be heard but because the stu
dents have a right to hear.
It is my most sincere hope that all 
The Tartans content will leave the 
community more informed, more 
self-aware, and more thoughtful. 
The opinions and perspectives of our 
readers help us achieve that goal. I 
thank all of you who have submitted 
letters to the editor, and encourage 
others who wish to share their views 
to do the same.

W. Bushs second inauguration, 
and news from the Martin Lu
ther King Jr. holiday.
About the programs long
term goals, Steenhuis stated 
that maintaining focus on issues 
that directly relate to commu

In an effort to continue expand

Senate denies funding 
for New Black Panther
SHABAZZ, from Al
open letter from the Huey P. 
Newton Foundation denounc
ing the New Black Panther Party 
and a number of quotations 
from Malik Shabazz. Kill ev
ery goddamn Zionist in Israel, 
Papasian read from an address 
that Shabazz gave in 2002. 
Goddamn little babies, god
damn old ladies, blow up Zion
ist supermarkets. Now, I really 
want this event to happen  I 
think he will be a really interest
ing speaker  but you all need 
to get a little spine and actually 
discuss this for what this is.
Many students supported 
funding Shabazz in the interest 
of exposure. Shingai Samudzi, 
a first-year in H&SS, said, It is 
not just our job to vote on our 
personal preferences and our in
dividual emotions.... I think its 
best not to act out of ignorance, 
and not to act out of fear. Tanvir Suri, a first-year in business 
administration, said, The fact 
is that by shielding people from 
it [Shabazzs speech], by stop
ping it from coming to campus, 
were not helping the student 
body.
Many other students, how
ever, disagreed. Sean Weinstock, a first-year in H&SS, said 
funding Shabazzs visit was 
not constructive in any way. 
Jonathan Mendelson, a junior 
computer and mathematical 
sciences major, stated, I really
dont think we should be using 
student activities money to fund 
hate. Samantha Rosenthal, 
a sophomore in chemical and 
biomedical engineering, noted 
that Senate would most likely 
unanimously disapprove of a 
white speaker with anti-AfricanAmerican opinions in a similar 
situation.
During the debate, Andres 
Bermudez, a junior social and 
decision sciences major, stood 
up before the assembly. Make 
no mistake, he declared. Fund
ing this event is putting money 
in the pocket of an anti-Semite.
At 7:20 pm, an hour and 
twenty minutes after the pro
posal had been brought to the 
floor, a vote was called. With a 
vote of 12 for, 12 against, and 
two abstaining, the motion 
failed to pass.
Shabazzs visit to campus, 
however, remains scheduled for 
February 17, and student group 
SPIRIT has agreed to host and 
promote the event.
Bermudez felt that at a time 
when Carnegie Mellon placed 
emphasis on unity through 
diversity, a speaker like Shabazz 
would not accomplish such a 
goal. It is obvious just from the 
discussion, he said, that this 
event is not bringing people to
gether.
Editors Note: Jonathan Mendel
son is a staffwriter for The Tar
tan.
Asian-interest Greek groups foster cultural awareness
engineering major Henry Chou, 
the vice president of Pi Delta Psi.
In addition to celebrating Asian 
holidays, the groups try to edu
cate the campus about Asian cul
ture by holding community activi
ties. Some of the events in which 
the groups are active include 
the International Food Festival, 
Night Market, and Asian Heritage 
Month.
One important misconception 
about the organizations is their 
perceived exclusivity. Each of the 
four groups accepts members of 
any race, ethnicity, or cultural 
background who are interested in 
exploring Asian culture.
Its going to take time for peo
ple to be more comfortable with 
being with mostly Asians, said 
Ranie Guo, president of alpha 
Kappa Delta Phi and a junior busi
ness administration major.
Its a family, agreed junior 
Eric Hong, president of Lambda 
Phi Epsilon. Its about who you 
get along with. According to 
Hong, the University of Kansas 
chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon is 
50 percent Caucasian-American.
Were not exclusive  we ac
cept everyone. We feel that cul
tural diversity is one of the traits 
of our fraternity, and within our 
fraternity theres a lot of diversity. 
We have brothers from all around 
the world, said Suh, whose 
fraternity includes a brother 
of Indian-Italian descent and a 
brother from Mauritius. Suh also 
explained that the pledging pro
cess of Pi Delta Psi fosters learn
ing and understanding about the 
brothers roots.

the groups is largely on an ini
tiative basis. The brothers and 
sisters put up flyers, hand out 
pamphlets, and rely on word of 
mouth for attracting members.
In that sense, its harder for 
us. The other groups have FMR. 
We work hard to get to know girls 
on an individual basis, said Guo. 
We do try to get to know people, 
but its a two-way street. If they 
think were exclusive, it hurts us. 
It would be better for us if people 
tried to get to know us too.
I think were perceived as 
being exclusive because its easy 
to visually see us as being Asian
Inter-Fraternity or Panhellenic 
Councils, the organizations send 
representatives to Greek Council 
meetings, and Kappa Phi Lambda 
and Pi Delta Psi are currently 
involved in the creation of the 
Multi-Greek Council. The MultiGreek Council, similar to IFC and 
Panhel, will have its own con
stitution, and may include CMU 
members of Kappa Alpha Psi, an 
African-American-interest fra
ternity that draws its members 
from the surrounding areas in 
participating cities rather than 
specific schools.
Like many of the Panhellenic 
sororities, one of the focuses of 
these Asian-interest organiza
tions is service. For example, al
pha Kappa Delta Phi focuses on 
fighting breast cancer, and Kappa 
Phi Lambda directs its attention 
to the Red Cross and the fight 
against domestic violence.
The distinguishing factor of 
these groups, however, is their 
focus on exploring and celebrat
ing Asian culture. What we try to 
do is to bring Asian awareness to 
the campus. We feel theres a lot 
of misunderstanding, and we try 
to break the stereotypes and edu
cate people about who we are, 
said junior materials science and
and looking very similar. People 
tend to jump to conclusions that 
were just a bunch of Asian girls 
without really giving us a chance 
and getting to know us, said ju
nior business major Na Young Joe, 
president of Kappa Phi Lambda.
The members of the Asianinterest Greek groups expressed 
hope that time will bring ac
ceptance. We want to integrate 
more, said Hong. To initiate this 
integration, Hong represented his 
fraternity this year in Kappa Al
pha Thetas Mr. Fraternity fund
raiser. I think it will take some 
time since were still new.
Kappa Phi Lambda has also 
made plans to integrate with the 
community, which include cosponsoring a campus-wide blood 
drive and being the first cultural 
Greek organization to build a 
blitz booth at Carnival.
It has to do with us getting to 
know the community and having 
the community get to know and 
accept us, said Guo.
In the meantime, these Greeks 
will continue to educate and cel
ebrate Asian heritage.
The Greek system should be 
representative of the whole popu
lation. It should fill the needs 
of everyone in the community, 
said Suh. Once we get to know 
other people in other organiza
tions, theyll realize that we arent 
that different. Were all CMU stu
dents.

Scientists make new 
attempt at fusion
An international collaboration 
of nations is endeavoring to build 
the worlds first fusion reactor 
that produces more energy than 
it consumes. The project, called 
the International Thermonuclear 
Experimental Reactor (ITER), 
is designed to demonstrate that 
fusion can generate almost limit
less amounts of electricity with
out creating long-lived radioac
tive waste linked with traditional 
fission reactors.
Scientists aim to produce 500 
megawatts of power from just 50 
megawatts of input. The fuel for 
the reactor is the hydrogen iso
tope deuterium, which is extract
ed from water. It will take 10 years 
and cost $6 billion to complete.

New magnetic star 
type discovered
Recent studies have revealed a 
new form of star known as a magnetar, which scientists are consid
ering to be an exotic big brother of 
pulsars. Magnetars are essentially 
pulsars that spin 100 times faster, 
rotating at approximately 1000 
revolutions per second and radi
ating magnetic fields rather than 
radio waves.
Magnetars, like pulsars, result 
from the collapsing of a sun
30 to 40 times larger than our 
sun. Research concludes that if 
a magnetar were placed halfway 
between the earth and the moon, 
every magnetic storage device on 
earth  such as credit cards, hard 
drives, and VHS tapes  would 
be wiped clean.

Mysterious oil slick 
endangers west coast
Dead and oil-covered seabirds 
are appearing on beaches from 
Santa Barbara to Huntington 
Beach, but investigators have been 
unable to find any of the signs typ
ically associated with an oil spill. 
Dana Michaels, a spokeswoman 
for the California Department of 
Fish and Game, said, Its not like 
theres a big slick someplace, and 
we can say, Thats the respon
sible party. This is a real mystery. 
Authorities are attempting to ana
lyze samples of the oily residue in 
order to compare it to chemical 
fingerprints in the states library 
of samples collected from ships
oil platforms and other sources. 
Officials said the spill has harmed 
more wildlife than any other spill 
in California coastal waters since 
the 1990 American Trader spill off 
the Orange County coast, which 
killed 3400 birds.

NASA makes plans to 
avoid next Columbia
NASA officials are consider
ing a plan to keep a second space 
shuttle and crew ready to launch 
each time astronauts make a trip 
into space on one of the space 
shuttles. After the analyzing the 
Columbia incident, experts con
cluded that they could have deter
mined the Columbia was inca
pable of a safe return and, had 
there been an emergency shuttle 
ready to launch with emergency 
supplies on board, many of the 
Columbia crew members could 
have been saved.
NASA believes that it could redi
rect a shuttle to the International 
Space Station when it cannot 
make the descent to Earth, where 
astronauts could wait safely for 
a rescue shuttle. The only fear is 
that the rescue ship could also 
suffer damage, resulting in two 
damaged ships in space. The most 
strenuous part of a rescue mission 
would be completing the back
up shuttles preparation quickly 
enough. NASA plans to have a 
backup shuttle and rescue crew 
ready for at least the next two 
missions.

Underwriters Laboratories Inc., 
or UL, on devices you may even 
be using right now.
Underwriters Labs was origi
nally founded in 1894 as the Un
der-writers Electrical Bureau. 
Today, the labs focus has ex
tended far beyond its initial 
specialization in electrical fire 
safety. UL testing is done on 
almost anything imaginable, 
from turkey fryers to sheetrock 
to Christmas tree lighting. In 
fact, UL testing has been done 
on products produced by over
68,000 manufacturers!
Labs such as UL cater to three 
distinct groups: government
regulators, manufacturers, and 
consumers. Government regu
lators such as the Occupational 
Safety and Health Association 
and the Consumer Product Safe
ty Commission (CPSC) draft 
federal laws that manufacturers 
must follow. Interestingly, these 
laws are sometimes very strict in 
their guidelines and sometimes 
very general. For example, the 
CPSC bans all fireworks that 
resemble candy or food too 
closely. They also require bicycle 
chains to have a minimum ten
sile strength of 1800 pounds.
With these federal regula
tions in hand, UL can build 
upon them, forming its own set 
of guidelines, called a standard
 essentially, a manual of im
portant safety design standards 
that is continually updated.
Manufacturers can purchase 
these standards from UL in or
der to better incorporate safety 
into their product designs.
Additionally, these manufac
turers can actually submit their 
product designs to one of the 
many UL labs around the world 
and have a safety evaluation 
performed. Here the scientists 
and engineers of UL will custom-design experiments to de
termine one or more aspects of 
the products safety. Common 
safety concerns include child 
safety, fire/electrical hazards, 
and potential for misuse.
It is important to note that 
the product safety testing done 
by UL is completely optional. 
As long as a manufacturer com
plies with federal regulations, 
it can sell whatever it wants. 
But many companies have long 
since determined that the extra 
money involved in third-party 
safety testing can significantly 
boost sales. After all, its never 
good for business when your 
customers are accidentally kill
ing, maiming, electrocuting, 
and burning themselves with 
your flagship product line. How, 
then, does the safety-conscious 
consumer know a product has 
undergone such testing?
Underwriters Laboratories 
Inc. has solved this problem by 
allowing manufacturers whose 
products have earned its ap
proval to display the circular
UL logo on their product. This 
benefits both the consumer and 
the manufacturer. A consumer 
benefits from the informed deci
sion the logo allows  the con
sumer can be confident that the 
product he or she is purchasing 
isnt going to pose a safety haz
ard.
Certain products, such as 
space heaters, highlight this 
trust, because cheap, untested 
competition poses an even 
greater danger than usual. 
Naturally, having consumers 
make their decisions in favor of 
UL-tested products benefits the 
manufacturers of these tested 
products as well, not only for the 
initial purchase but also for the 
possible establishment of brand 
loyalty. In return, UL receives a 
small fee for every logo placed 
on a tested product. With about 
19 billion products labeled with 
the UL logo in 2003 alone, this 
can add up.
When we spend our money, 
we expect a certain level of sat
isfaction, whether were buying 
an $800 LCD display or a $10 
desk lamp. Inherent to this sat
isfaction is the need for safety 
and reliability. These go hand in 
hand because often as a product 
becomes unreliable, it also be
comes unsafe. We can be thank
ful, therefore, that companies 
like Underwriters Laboratories 
exist to keep products safe for 
our consumption.

Tsunami shortened Earths rotation

Junior Staffwriter
On December 26, 2004, an 
earthquake off the coast of In
donesia devastated vast areas of 
land and shocked people around 
the world. Perhaps most surpris
ingly, though, this massive quake 
has permanently shortened the 
length of a day on Earth.
The word tsunami combines the 
Japanese tsu, harbor, and nami, 
waves. Unlike normal waves that 
arise from the wind pushing at 
the surface of the water, a tsu
namis kinetic energy comes from 
beneath the water. A tsunami 
arises only after an earthquake 
because of the motion of tectonic 
plates, according to Mike Cheng, 
a sophomore in physics. When a 
dense tectonic plate digs under a 
lighter one in a process known as 
subduction, the lighter plate on 
top may crack. This crack causes 
a massive release of stress energy 
that rockets the broken piece of 
the sea floor upward through the 
water. The force created by the
In 90 
million 
years, the 
wobble 
will have 
subtracted 
an entire 
leap day.
December 26 earthquake could 
be equated to the explosive force 
of 190 million tons of TNT, a nine 
on the Richter scale.
When the broken piece of 
Earth shoots upward, it pushes 
the water above it. But, as grav
ity acts on the water, the waters 
motion is directed horizontally 
along the surface of the sea. 
The wave glides to the shore at 
an alarming speed; Decembers 
tsunami traveled 375 miles in 
75 minutes. A tsunamis speed 
is a function of the depth of the 
water: The speed can be calcu
lated by taking the square root of 
the product of the acceleration of
gravity and the depth. Only after 
the tsunami reaches within 10 
feet of the shore, when the wa
ter hits an embankment and its 
horizontal velocity ceases, does it 
surge upwards into a monstrous 
wall of water.
The tsunami of December 26,
2004, crashed over the shores 
of Southern Asia, killed nearly
200,000 people, and ruined 
vast areas of civilization. These 
waves covered distances of over 
1600 kilometers [more than 
1000 miles] in a little over two 
hours and struck with terrible 
ferocity Sri Lanka, India, Ma
laysia and even parts of Africa, 
with waves measuring over
10 meters [32 feet] high, the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review 
reported M. Bernardine 
Dias, a special research sci
entist at Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys Robotics In
stitute, as saying. Dias 
was in Sri Lanka, her 
homeland, at the time 
of the disaster. Just as 
Dias refers to the day of 
the tsunami as one fate
ful day, the tsunami will 
remain a black mark in 
world history. Experts 
say, however, that there 
may be more to the tsu
namis mark on time.
According to scientists 
at NASA, the impact of the 
earthquake off the coast of 
Indonesia caused the earth 
to spin 2.68 milliseconds 
faster. This faster spin is 
caused by a mass of rock 
falling inward, closer to the 
Earths axis of rotation, making 
the Earth less oblate, accord
ing to CMU physics professor 
Helmut Vogel. To illustrate the 
Earths oblateness, Vogel likens 
the Earths shape to that of an 
M&M; the Earth is fatter around 
its equator than its poles. When 
the heavier tectonic plate jutted 
downwards, the Earth became 
less plump around the middle, or 
more spherical.
Vogel said, The mass that 
got rearranged in the quake is 
impossible to measure directly, 
but by comparison, filling the 
Three Gorges reservoir in China 
[which holds 40 cubic kilome
ters of water] results only in a 
change [of] .06 milliseconds. So 
the effect of the quake (2.68 mil
liseconds) is almost 50 times big
ger than that!
The website www.jpl.nasa.gov 
likens the effect of the Earths 
mass falling inward to that of 
a spinning ice skater who pulls 
her arms inward. This is cor
rect, in principle, except it should 
be compared to a skater pulling 
only one arm in, said Vogel. To
demonstrate his assertion, Vogel 
devised an experiment for his 
unsuspecting interviewer.
Vogel instructed 
me to sit on 
a rotating stool, 
outstretch 
my arms, 
and hold 
onto 
free

weights.
As he began 
to spin me on 
the stool, Vogel 
told me to pull in 
both the weights to my 
chest. I then spun much 
faster, evidence that condensed 
mass does have a faster rotation. 
When I thought the dizzying 
trick was over, Vogel told me to 
hold out the weights again. This 
time, I was instructed to pull only 
one arm in. The effect was surely 
noticeable: I again spun faster, 
but with only one arm pulled in I 
almost wobbled off the chair.
Indeed, scientists believe that 
the Earth has wobbled to a 
different axis of rotation. Be
cause only one side of the Earths 
rock fell inward by one part in 10
billion,
its axis of rotation tilted as I did 
on the stool: Your body wants to 
rotate on a vertical axis, but when 
you pull only one arm in, you 
rotate on an inclined axis, said 
Vogel.
So what has the Earths 
wobble done to time as we 
know it? Vogel calculated that 
the decrease in a days time by 
2.68 milliseconds will amount to 
one leap second in 1000 years.
In 90 mil
lion years, the wobble 
will have subtracted an entire 
leap day. He also says, however, 
that seismic events continually 
affect the rate of the Earths 
rotation.
Although the Earths rota
tion has sped up, Vogel said the 
tides due to the Moon keep slow
ing the Earths rotation. Still, 
Carnegie Mellon students may 
benefit by having another excuse 
for losing track of time.

Sony's QRIO boogies down on college campus for first time
The School of Computer Science wishes to publicly acknowledge 
the outstanding academic achievement of the following students who 
have been named to the Deans List for the Fall 2004 semester.
mentioned QRIOs role as cor
porate ambassador, representing 
the company and its highest tech
nology. They are concerned the 
companys image may be tainted 
by potential customers using the 
robot in certain ways.
Despite their caution, Kozuki 
says Sony has long-term goals 
for QRIO. His best guess places 
the robot inside livings rooms in 
about five years, where it will en
tertain and serve as a humanoid 
interface between people, home 
appliances, and networks. We 
wouldnt create something like 
[it] if we didnt mean to get this 
into the home, said Kozuki in a 
later interview. Instead of enter
ing search terms on a keyboard, 
a person can simply ask QRIO a 
question. Using an Internet con
nection, it can potentially retrieve 
stock quotes and weather predic
tions and even search for infor
mation.
Kozuki demonstrated a portion 
of QRIOs interactive abilities by 
bowing and saying Konichiwa, 
the Japanese phrase for hello. 
Using two cameras in its head, 
QRIO recognized the act, lined up 
its diminutive body with Kozukis, 
and returned the gesture, uttering 
its own electronic Konichiwa.
The combination of human in
teraction and wireless Internet 
access allows the robot to be more 
than a novelty. Kozuki described a
recent software demonstration in 
Japan where QRIO was asked to 
list television shows which were 
currently playing. Using his wire
less internet link, QRIO retrieved 
the listings from Japans version 
of TV Guide and related them to 
the user. The demonstrator then 
asked QRIO to change the tele
vision to one of the listed shows. 
Pointing its arm, QRIO used infra
red transmitters  like the kind 
that are in remote controls  to 
switch the channels.
Kozuki, currently a software 
development engineer for Sony, 
graduated from CMU in 2001 
with a masters degree in electri
cal and computer engineering. He 
got his first chance to work with 
robots in 1999, when his aunt 
 a Sony employee  recruited 
him for a position demonstrating 
the Sony AIBO. Since then, hes 
been demonstrating Sony robot
ics around the country and today 
is only one of two engineers who 
have access to QRIO in the United 
States.
Kozuki said he was not very 
interested in programming while 
completing his degree. It was the 
physical nature of robotics that 
captured his heart. He said when 
a program crashes on a computer, 
all you get is a blue screen. His 
feelings for robots are quite dif
ferent. When [robots crash], its 
like they die.

were actually warnings to the ro
bot handlers to be careful not to 
hurt themselves.
Komiyama stated multiple 
times that Sony had no plans for 
commercializing QRIO. He said 
the company was still studying 
academic and research applica
tions of the robot and that their 
nearly 20-year relationship with 
the University would influence 
their decision. If we do anything 
in academia, this is the university 
[well come to], said Komiyama. 
Yet no date was set, as he said 
there is no timetable for academic 
deployment. Sony is being more 
deliberate with this decision 
than with its AIBO robotic dog, 
the robot of choice for the four
legged division of International 
RoboCup, an annual robotic soc

Manuela Veloso, a professor

was an improvement on robots 
like ASIMO  Hondas bipedal 
humanoid robot which visited

THE TARTAN31 January 3005
FromTheEditorialBoard
Pittsburgh needs creative way 
to retain and attract graduates
concerted effort on the part of the city 
planners, and would probably include 
improved public transit, a relaxation of 
liquor laws, and an attempt to get young 
voters involved with local government.
Its not clear that this plan is a good 
idea for Iowa. In order for the tax break 
to make a difference, salaries would have 
to be competitive with offers that young 
workers could get elsewhere. Pittsburgh 
already has much of the economic in
frastructure for such a plan to work. 
Coupled with attempts to incubate new 
businesses (such as easy access to loans 
and office space), this tax break could 
make the difference between students 
leaving for other cities and staying here 
to start their careers. A graduate with a 
degree in computer science is not likely 
to make enough money in Iowa to con
sider moving there instead of to Califor
nia, Massachusetts, Texas, or any other 
state with a large tech sector. The same 
could be true of almost any degree in 
a technical, financial, medical, or other 
high demand area. Pittsburgh could offer 
young college graduates from local col
leges, as well as universities across the 
country, the ability to move here and 
make a competitive salary in these fields. 
More importantly, the already low costof-living and relative safety of the city 
makes Pittsburgh an ideal place for these 
young graduates to start both a career 
and a family.
Too often plans that focus on economic 
development revolve around large tax 
breaks to large corporations or govern
ment spending in defense or other areas. 
A truly effective economic development 
plan needs to focus on making Pittsburgh 
attractive to young workers; such a tax 
credit would be an innovative part of a 
larger plan.
The Iowa legislature will soon discuss 
a proposal to eliminate the state income 
tax for anyone under 30. This bill is aimed 
at rejuvenating the states economy and 
specifically hopes to reverse a brain drain
 more than half of Iowas college stu
dents leave the state. While Pittsburgh 
faces significantly different challenges 
from Iowas, eliminating the state income 
tax for 18-30 year olds is an idea that 
holds merit for the Pittsburgh area too.
It is no secret that some of the bright
est students in the nation graduate from 
Pittsburgh schools only to leave the city 
after graduation. One merely needs to 
look around to notice a decisive lack of 
Pittsburghers in their mid-twenties and 
early thirties.
If Pittsburgh were to waive the citys 
earned income tax and provide tax relief 
for the state of Pennsylvanias personal 
income tax, the city would benefit in the 
long run. Such a move could provide a 
tangible incentive for recent graduates to 
stay and work in the city.
It may be counterintuitive to think that 
a city in such financial turmoil should 
chip away at its own tax base, but such 
a move could bring funding in through 
other forms. Students that would other
wise have left town would stay to start 
their own companies or work for existing 
firms. They would spend their money 
at other local businesses, utilize local 
services, and continue to be a part of the 
local community. Perhaps most impor
tantly, these people would likely settle 
down and raise a family here, becoming 
permanent, tax-paying Pittsburgh resi
dents.
While such a plan has obvious merits, 
it will not work in a vacuum. A successful 
campaign to increase college graduate 
retention in Pittsburgh would require a

Cartoon Criticismsmates, our colleagues, and our friends.
Fraternities are organizations that 
are founded on principles of honor, 
and honor demands that we respect our 
female peers. We are insulted that the 
cartoonist believes fraternities are dens 
of promiscuity where women are valued 
only for their ability to deliver sex.
The cartoon is especially offen
sive to sorority members, our female 
counterparts in the Greek community, 
who are some of the staunchest sup
porters of fraternities. We work closely 
with these women to raise money for 
charity through events such as Greek 
Sing and better the community through 
countless service projects.
It is the women of sororities and 
Carnegie Mellon in general whom you
have libeled in this cartoon, and you 
owe them an apology.
We are infuriated that the cartoonist 
has such a wildly inaccurate miscon
ception of Greek life. This cartoon prop
agates a stereotype about fraternities 
that has been causing serious damage to 
our community. Our organizations' are 
nothing like the organizations portrayed 
in this comic and on television.
We are each composed of uni
que individuals who are serious about 
scholarship and citizenship. Its time 
that the Greeks got the recognition 
they deserve for their invaluable contri
butions to the campus community. 11
The Inter-Fraternity Council strongly 
objects to the comic printed in the Pillbox 
section of the last issue of The Tartan. 
The comic portrayed busty bimbos dis
carding their kneepads because the 
University is getting rid of fraternities. 
The clear insinuation was that frater
nities only associate with airheaded 
women and only so they can receive 
sexual gratification from those women.
Ourstrongestobjectionis the cartoons 
characterization of the females who 
support fraternities. The women who 
keep company with fraternities do for 
the same reasons that any other people 
of different genders keep company with 
each other. Our women are our teamTimothy Bowen

on campus? I was recently reading the 
CMU Diversity Advisory Councils re
port on diversity, and was surprised to 
find a sentence to the effect that Asians 
are not counted in this diversity report 
because CMU has too many! These 
diversity advisors are scaring me; they 
dont care about people, only about 
achieving their perfectly-balanced eth
nic potpourri.
And Brad Yankivers piece was just 
funny. Apparently, the numbers are 
grim and students would be shocked 
to hear that there are just too many 
white people on campus. If its so hor
rible, why dont we just start admitting 
only politically correct races? I can see it 
now: the class of 2009, genetically engi
neered to contain maximum variation!
Whose fault is it that this campus 
lacks diversity? Is there a racist on the
admissions board? Has Jared Cohon 
secretly been plotting something?'Tell 
me! Whos to blame? \
I believe that real diversity can occur 
only through under-represented races 
helping themselves, and not when peo
ple are forced into a community simply 
to represent their skin color. Only then 
will we see a more diverse campus. It 
is ridiculous to think that feeling guilty 
for being white or hating CMU fotits 
lack of diversity is going to ch&nge 
statistics. mu
While I support the African-American 
cause and hope to see more AfricanAmericans on campus, I view the cur
rent guilt-trip-motivated diversity cru
sade as counterproductive.
Affirmative Action
There are many who refuse to toler
ate any point of view other than their 
own concerning race issues, and I for 
one am grateful to Mr. Su for delicately 
expressing a contrary opinion.
Indeed, why is it that Jewish stu
dents, whose grandparents were 
hunted almost to the point of extinc
tion, currently represent the Jewish 
race very well in academia, and in 
numbers disproportionate to their pop
ulation? If anyone, the Jews should 
be the oppressed people, since their 
Holocaust was much more recent than 
the African-American horror: slavery. 
While Im certainly happy for the Jews, 
I dont think they achieved this through 
affirmative action.
Again, why are Asians so numerous
Fuel-efficient cars may n< prove to be cost-efficient
The automobile industry is polarized. 
While one half of the industry focuses on 
building large, powerful trucks and fuelguzzling sports cars, the other half has 
been focusing on smaller gas-electric hy
brids to maximize gas mileage. While the 
former are extremely popular, especially 
along densely populated areas such as 
New York City, Boston, and Washington, 
D.C., the latter are becoming more and 
more prevalent out west.
Over the past few years, California 
has become a leader in the hybrid car in
dustry with 42 percent of all hybrid cars 
purchased in-state in 2004. Hybrid cars, 
which generate their own electricity and 
require a very small amount of gasoline, 
have been saving consumers hundreds, if 
not thousands, of dollars a year, depend
ing on the number of miles driven.
Although consumers save, it costs the 
state money that would have otherwise 
been gathered through the liquid-fuel 
tax. The cost of maintaining the road
ways will soon exceed the revenue gained 
from the tax. However, there is a pro
posed solution: mileage tracking.
The proposal would be to install a 
small global positioning system (GPS) 
tracking device into the base of every 
car that will record the number of miles 
traveled, and then transmit the data to a 
centralized system. The owner of the car 
is then charged for the number of miles 
traveled, rather than the amount of gas 
pumped. But before this can be imple
mented, many changes need to be made.
One change that needs to be consid
ered is the matter of invading a drivers 
privacy. Many Americans fear being mon
itored, refusing to use safe services such 
as E-ZPass on the East coast, which allow 
for simpler transactions by using a small 
device. What information these devices 
are allowed to transmit, such as location 
and time spent at a location, needs to be 
addressed and resolved.
What appears to be the most glaring 
issue, though, is the incentive that the 
current system gives to those who drive 
fuel-efficient cars. By moving to this new 
system of taxing miles traveled, much of 
the incentive to drive fuel-efficient cars 
is reduced. Under this new system, there 
would need to be a set of controls calcu
lating the number of miles traveled ver
sus other factors such as fuel efficiency.
Overall, this system seems far too 
complicated. It does seem, though, like 
the goal of maintaining highways and 
the environment could be approached in 
a different manner.
New forms of asphalt, based off a rubber-asphalt composite, have been recently 
developed which could be used to replace 
or repair current roads. Although there 
would be an initial expense, the roads 
would help to pay for themselves through 
lowered maintenance costs.
Although states like California are fac
ing budget shortages due to the decline in 
profits for the gas tax, legislators need to 
seriously think of the economic and envi
ronmental repercussions of their actions, 
despite how inventive they may be. In 
order to better protect our environment 
and encourage low fuel consumption, we 
need to consider the incentives for driv
ing fuel-efficient vehicles and think of 
ways to accommodate them.

I appreciate Alexander Sus rintro
duction of affirmative action to the 
pages of The Tartans Forum Section 
(January 24, 2005). His column re
peats some of the arguments for and 
against the use of racial preferences in 
college admissions. He cites two main 
reasons for affirmative action, both 
related to the historic discrimination 
faced by underrepresented minorities, 
especially African-Americans. However, 
there is another rationale for affirma
tive action which was, in fact, the major 
point of the Supreme Courts decision 
in 2003 in the University of Michigan 
cases and the central idea on which we 
at Carnegie Mellon base our affirmative 
action.
The Supreme Court found in 2003 
that the use of race, as one factor among 
many in college admissions, could be 
justified on the grounds that there is 
educational value in having a diverse 
student body. This is a very important 
point which is often missed in debates 
over affirmative action. It is an argu
ment for affirmative action that has 
been around since the Courts deci
sion in the Bakke case in 1978, but it
has been controversial ever since. The 
significance of the courts decision in 
the Michigan case is its affirmation of 
this rationale for the use of race as a 
consideration in admission.
Carnegie Mellon has a broad vision 
for undergraduate education. We se
lect our students based on many at
tributes, each important for individual 
and collective success. Those who might 
imagine, because of our rigor, that we 
are a narrow environment keying solely 
on a handful of measures, learn quickly 
the richness of the place, much of it directiy attributable to the diversity of our 
student community.
At Carnegie Mellon, we have the lux
ury of being able to choose our 1300 
new students from an applicant pool of 
more than 15,000, the overwhelming 
majority of whom have the qualifica
tions and preparation to be successful 
here. Our commitment in our admis
sions process is to evaluate every ap
plicant on the basis of many factors, 
including those that would contribute 
to diversity, in order to build a class that 
will make available to students the ben
efits of living and learning in a diverse
community.
We interpret diverse community 
broadly to include a variety of vari
ables, including geographical origin, 
race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
socioeconomic background, academic 
interests, and other talents and inter
ests, like leadership and athletic skills. 
Indeed, the diversity of interests that 
comes from our unusual composition 
(arts, technology, business, science, 
humanities, and policy) is one ofJthe 
most attractive and important feaffftes 
of Carnegie Mellon.
Affirmative action can be viewed 
as divisive, especially when its cast in 
the terms chosen by Alexander Su! ln 
fact, when viewed from an institutional 
perspective and from the point of Vi^w 
of the community, it takes on a differ
ent color. Rather than the zero-sum 
game that some see in the admissions 
process, we should understand, instead, 
that everyone at Carnegie Mellon ben
efits from diversity.

Harvard brouhaha blown out of proportion
Chang
Harvard president Lawrence 
Summers, famous for his con
troversial public comments, has 
returned from three years of rel
ative quiet, causing an uproar by 
saying that women have an in
nate inability to achieve at the 
same level as men in the fields of 
math and science. Predictably, 
Womens rights activists and libe'fkls were quick to denounce the 
^supposed institutional sexism, 
situation does seem pretty 
But for whom?
SSLike so many other issues in 
real world, this isnt black 
white; neither side is comKfctely right, nor completely 
wfong. However, both sides are 
having problems realizing that. 
Summers comment was obvi
ously not well thought out, and 
certainly not presented properly. 
" Bilt contrary to what many of his 
critics seem to believe, it was not 
made with the intent of belittling 
women, nor does it indicate any 
misogynistic sentiment on the 
gart of Summers or Harvard.
''in the face of steady criti.cism, Summers has been forced 
^cTback down with his tail be
tween his legs. His office has 
pleased three increasingly sub
missive and defensive letters of 
apology, and rightly so: Even if 
1 lie didnt mean to cause offense, 
he did. Sadly, Summers oppo
nents have wasted the golden 
opportunity that was presented 
r to (them. They have been quick 
ntot| spout rhetoric while waving 
the flag of political correctness, 
'denouncing him without being
constructive themselves.
Summers remarks cant be 
fully understood without con
text. Summers made them ex
temporaneously while delivering 
a speech titled Diversifying the 
Science Work Force: The Move
ment of Women and UnderrepGene Kim/Art Staff
resented Minorities into S&E Ca
reers, at a National Bureau of 
Economic Research conference 
as part of the Science Engineer
ing Workforce Project. Unfortu
nately, the speech was intended 
for private consumption, so there 
is no official transcript. Most of
the brouhaha, however, seems 
to be focused on two of his 
points: First, that Harvard has 
few women professors because 
it draws from the best of the 
best, where women are scarce; 
and second, that females may be 
naturally less geared towards the 
sciences than males are.
Those two arguments would 
have been much stronger had 
Summers presented scientific 
evidence supporting them. Un
fortunately, he did (and possibly 
could) not. Summers critics have 
a strong, valid point about his 
comments lacking tact and sen
sitivity. They can even plausibly 
argue that those comments were 
akin to a Freudian slip, revealing 
traces of sexism. But when they 
start to misinterpret Summers 
words in an attempt to paint him 
as a misogynist who believes that 
women are inferior to men across 
the board, his critics lose cred
ibility.
In his third apology letter (pub
lished at www.president.harvard. ed u/speech es/2005/wom - 
ensci.html), Summers writes, I 
did not say, and I do not believe, 
that girls are intellectually less 
able than boys, or that women 
lack the ability to succeed at the 
highest levels of science. It is 
a fact that there are inequali
ties today in the way men and 
women in the fields of math and 
sciences are treated. Summers 
only wanted to encourage people 
to give thought to the situation, 
but sadly (though unsurpris
ingly), his audience just grabbed 
for the nearest politically correct 
response.
Nancy Hopkins, a biologist 
from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, was in the room 
when Summers made his com
ments and said, I just couldnt 
breathe, because this kind of bias 
makes me physically ill, the Bos
ton Globe reported. Kim Gandry, 
president of the National Or
ganization for Women (NOW), 
said, [Summers] doesnt seem 
to believe that discrimination ex
ists. NOW released a scathing 
press release in response to the 
incident, which called for Sum
mers to resign on the grounds 
that such an esteemed institu
tion should set a standard [that] 
Summers appears unable to 
maintain.
Not everyone, or even all 
women, shared that opinion. I 
left with a sense of elation at 
his ideas, the Washington Post 
reported Claudia Goldin, a Har
vard professor, as saying. I was 
proud that the president of my 
university retains the inquisitive
ness of an academic. Bloggers 
and editorial writers raced to 
opine, summarizing their per
spectives with titles like Politi
cally Convenient Collegiate Cor
rectness and You got science in 
my sexism!
In a twisted, ironic way, Sum
mers sort of achieved his goal: 
People are certainly talking 
about what he said. Sadly, too 
much of the talk is about Sum
mers by people in the race to 
be the most politically correct, 
and not enough is about the real 
topic at hand  the place of 
women and other minorities in 
science.

Horowitz attacks student, loses phone debate
Mark Egerman
'-'""Last week, David Horowitz 
"appeared as an extra-special 
"gti'est on WRCTs show On 
vYhfe Right. I had not been in^fottned of his appearance and 
^was not listening to the show 
until someone alerted me to the 
"situation.
'""''When I tuned in, Horowitz 
~'W&s talking about my decision 
'not to run one of his advertise
ments last semester. As I was in 
the UC, I decided to head down 
Cto-WRCT to see if theyd be in
terested in having me debate 
him. They put me on the phone, 
and we talked for over 20 
minutes.
Let me put this in unequivo
cal terms: If I had listened to 
the first 20 minutes of the show
17 and heard what Horowitz had 
,,^d about me, I would not have 
ft&en nearly as polite as I was. 
Only later, when I heard a re-TRrn Jcording of the show, did I learn 
' tiiat Horowitz had accused me 
'"oi-being a vulgar Marxist for 
^pointing out that the Tribune"Review was owned by his chief 
n,funder, Richard Mellon Scaife. 
Horowitz said that Scaife paid11 j \ s. rabout 10 percent of his bills (I 
/ question this number and suspect that its much higher) but 
7 Jig. thought it was a smear 
^^ctic for me to expect that the
Tribune-Review would disclose 
this conflict of interest.
Well, David, look whos talk
ing. On the front page of the 
website for his FrontPage maga
zine, theres a nice little picture 
of George Soros manipulating 
the Democratic donkey.
You see, Horowitz is pas
sionate about disclosing ex
actly who funds the left and 
has dedicated a significant 
amount of column space to writ
ing about the shadow party of 
funders that control the left. In 
fact, this seems to be one of his 
chief campaigns.
Now, I would never accuse 
Horowitz of being a vulgar 
Marxist  because I know 
that words have meanings. Yet 
Horowitz seems to have no 
problem with being wrong or 
being a hypocrite.
What right does Horowitz 
have to get on the air of CMUs 
radio station and attack a CMU 
student? Why is a national 
commentator picking on a col
lege kid? He is fabulously well 
funded, has been doing this for 
30 years, and yet he seems to 
believe that its okay to call me 
names on the air using words 
like hatemonger, Machiavel
lian, and totalitarian, and 
say that I cant handle an 
argument.
Perhaps most amazingly, 
he makes himself out to be 
the victim. On the air, he kept 
saying how I had wronged him, 
saying [Egerman] attacked
me by choosing not to run his 
advertisement. Its stunning, 
really, how hes able to construct 
victimization where none 
exists.
Horowitzs central claim to 
victim status was that anyone 
who has read this ad can see that 
its reasonable. When I picked 
up the phone, the host asked me 
what I found questionable about 
his advertisement. Without a 
copy of the ad in front of me, 
I responded immediately: The 
advertisement had a picture of 
a fuse on it; this was incendiary 
in its nature.
Amazingly, Horowitz started 
to deny that there was a lit fuse 
on the ad, but when he realized 
that he was caught red-handed, 
he admitted that I was right.
He then demanded to know 
what else was questionable. I 
responded again, pointing out 
that there was a specific line 
that blurs the line between Pal
estinian terrorists and all Pales
tinians. Horowitz then went on 
to embarrass himself.
Horowitz: Im sure that if 
someone wrote an ad about the 
Second World War you wouldnt 
make the distinction that if they

Now, if Horowitz were some 
17-year-old posting in an online
forum, everyone would invoke 
Godwins Law and stop listening 
to him. Instead, hes a 66-yearold with a lot of money and the 
bizarre opinion that he has an 
absolute right to be published in 
the newspaper of a private uni
versity. (He later talked about 
suing school newspapers that 
wouldnt publish his ads.)
By the end of the debate, I 
realized that Horowitz is a man 
who insists that hes being dis
criminated against when people 
disagree with him.
We may be hearing a lot more 
from Horowitz as he tries to pass 
his Bill of Academic Freedoms 
in the state legislature. Hes 
sure to use the same bluster
ing style there too: demanding 
to be heard, attacking those who 
disagree with him and claiming 
to be a victim, all while hoping 
that nobody questions the un
derlying facts.
Horowitz thinks that just 
because hes rich and power
ful he can force others to listen 
to him. Its amazing, though, 
that he would want anyone to 
listen to him: Because when we 
start listening, we realize the 
lies.

too dubious
INDECENCY, from A6
Currently it is considered okay 
to promote programs such as The 
Swan, where women butcher 
themselves for the sake of a bet
ter body, and it is appropriate to 
depict violent scenes on CSI and 
Law & Order.
Yet ABC affiliates pulled the 
showing of Saving Private Ryan 
for scenes depicting violence  
scenes that were based on fact. 
If these scenes are indecent, then 
are we then going to edit out vio
lence from history books?
The FCC has insulted the 
intelligence of the nation by 
suggesting we cannot handle 
scenes of nudity in the correct 
context.
Now this writer must stand 
by and wonder, in fear, that one 
day she will write a screenplay 
with a womans breast in it that 
will be considered too hot for 
TV  and be unceremoniously 
replaced with another episode of 
Fear Factor.

Womens basketball loses
by Andrew Clearfield
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team continued their 
recent slide with a 76-48 defeat 
to the Emory Eagles Friday night 
m Atlanta. The loss was the ninth 
ina row for the Tartans. The 
team is winless in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA). The 
Tartans offense was led by junior 
forward Rebecca Shore, who led 
the team with 12 points, nine 
rebounds, and four assists. Both 
teams began the contest sluggish
ly, with Carnegie Mellon perhaps 
showing the negative effects of 
a nearly 500-mile trip the night 
before to Atlanta. However, while 
the Tartans never seemed to loos
en up, it took Emory only seven 
minutes: The Eagles went on a
9-0 run early in the first half to 
claim a double-digit advantage.
The Tartans kept the game 
close for much of the way, but 
Eftiorys amazing three-point 
barrage (11 for 17 from behind 
thfe arc) kept CMU back  as 
well as the Eagles dominating 
performance by all-conference 
guard Beth Bergmann. Bergmann 
had 19 points and prevented 
any hopes of a Carnegie Mellon 
comeback. Though the Tartans 
had closed to within 10 points 
at the half, Emory pulled away 
in the second half. They held a 
44-26 advantage in the period to 
dose out Carnegie Mellon.
For the Tartans, the loss goes 
down as just another learn
ing experience for a team that 
has had more than their share 
already. As junior point guard 
Ashley Mazziota said, Were still 
a young team struggling with 
everything right now. The shots 
arent falling and were giving up 
a lot of points but we can only just 
keep pushing to get better.
Even more than Emorys ter
rific outside shooting, the Tartans 
were done in by an amazing 
29 turnovers. Senior guard 
Carissa Sain, and the rest of the 
Tartan backcourt were bothered 
by Emorys constant pressure. 
This pressure not only resulted 
in numerous turnovers, but also 
limited the teams ability to set up 
their own offensive plays.
Further curbing the Tartans 
possession time was a negative 
rebounding margin of 39-5. The 
differential of minus 34 was the 
teams worst of the season and 
caused the Tartans to attempt
14 fewer field goals than Emory, 
to go along with only 44 per
cent shooting from the field. For 
Mazziota, these two statistics 
were insurmountable.
They had the ball a lot more 
than us because of their defense 
and rebounding and it made it 
too difficult for us to make a real 
run.
Sundays game in Cleveland has 
been postponed due to weather, 
so the Tartans will return to Skibo 
Gymnasium on February 4.

Patriots and Eagles clash Sunday for Super Bowl title
FOOTBALL, from A10
their defensive line shut down 
Atlantas Mike Vick last week. 
They signed Jevon Kearse in the 
off season to create a championship-caliber defense, and he has 
carried the front four through 
games at times. Dont be surprised 
if Kearse, better known as The 
Freak when he was with Tennes
see, harasses Tom Brady all game, 
forcing him to get rid of the ball 
early and often. For the Patriots, 
the young line of Ty Warren, Jar
vis Green, and Vince Wilfork had 
trouble stuffing the rush in the 
regular season, but has tightened 
up considerably in the postseason. 
Itll be interesting to see what the 
Philadelphia offensive line does 
to these guys. Edge: Philadelphia. 
Linebackers: For the Pats, Tedy 
Bruschi has been playing the 
game with a controlled insanity
since the late 90s, and is now 
getting recognized for his 
ability. Ted Johnson, Willie McGinest, Mike Vrabel, Rosevelt Col
vin, and Roman Phifer are all ver
satile veterans who can play the 
run or drop back into coverage. 
Philadelphia has Pro Bowler Jere
miah Trotter and Dhani Jones, who 
lead a strong core of underrated 
guys who allowed an NFC-low 16 
points per game. Tough call, but 
you cant ignore the depth for the 
Pats. Edge: New England. 
Secondary: This one is probably 
the easiest decision. The Eagles 
have had a strong secondary since 
the late 90s, primarily because of 
Brian Dawkins leadership from 
the safety position. This year, 
the class of 02  Lito Sheppard, 
Sheldon Brown, and Michael 
Lewis, all drafted in the first two 
rounds of the 2002 NFL draft
 have made this unit the best
in the playoffs, shutting down the 
Vikings and Randy Moss in the 
Divisional round. The Pats, on 
the other hand, are without their 
starting cornerbacks and have one 
of the most makeshift secondaries 
in Super Bowl history. Though 
theyve played well, McNabb will 
be able to exploit their weak
nesses. Edge: Philadelphia.
Special Teams: Adam Vinatieri 
could punch his ticket to the NFL 
Hall of Fame with another big 
Super Bowl performance. David 
Akers has been one of the most 
solid kickers in the league over 
the past few years. However, the 
key here may go way back to the 
preseason, when the Eagles cut 
special teams MVP Sean Morey, 
who eventually signed with the 
Steelers. Morey is a hard-nosed 
player in the Tedy Bruschi mold, 
and his absence with the Patriots 
attention to special teams could
make a big difference in this 
game. This could be a blocked 
punt or a kick return for a touch
down, or even just a missed block 
that costs the Eagles some yard
age and keeps them out of field 
goal range. Edge: New England. 
Coaching: Andy Reid is a good 
coach, but Bill Belichick has 
taken a team tom apart by in
juries and stormed through the 
best teams in the AFC with them. 
If the Eagles were facing anyone 
else, Reid would get the nod, but 
theyre up against the man who 
influences how the rest of the 
league signs free agents and vet
erans. Edge: New England.
Final Prediction: A few big 
plays will shape a physical 
battle between two defenses. Two 
great coaches call two great game 
plans, but in the end the Patriots' 
defense will wear down McNabb. 
The Patriots win 23-17. Dynasty.

Men win, women fall short against Diplomats
File PhotoFirst-year Anna Kochalko won the 1000 free event on Saturday.
by Erin Goldberger
Asst. Forum Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
swim team defeated the twentyfourth-ranked Franklin and 
Marshall Diplomats 129-94 on 
Saturday. Despite the perfor
mance of Franklin and Marshalls
Derek Nowak, who won the 1000 
freestyle and was a part of the 
victorious 200 free relay team, 
the combination of Tartan senior 
Chris Pearson and sophomore 
David Krzeminski were too much 
for the Diplomats. Krzeminski 
won both the 50-yard freestyle 
(21.65) and 100 free (47.22), 
and Pearson captured the 100
backstroke (53.70) and 500 free 
(4:39.59) for the Tartans.
There were many notable per
formances from Tartan swim
mers on Saturday. First-year 
Damian McIntyre took home 
first in the 200 medley relay and 
Carnegie Mellon placed 1-2-3 in 
the 200 free event with junior 
Brian Hunter leading the way. 
Once ahead in the meet, the men 
expanded their lead by placing 
1-2 in the 200IM with strong per
formances by Damian McIntyre 
(2:02.30) and Bobby Colyer 
(2:03.20). The Tartans also took 
1-2-3 in the 100 freestyle behind 
Krzeminski and clinched the meet 
with Pearsons victory in the 100 
breaststroke. Behind these strong 
performances, the mens team 
handed Franklin and Marshall 
their first loss in five meets, and 
have set the tone for what looks 
like another promising season.
Despite the strong win in the 
mens division, the Tartan women 
werent as lucky, dropping a 
115-90 decision to fifteenthranked Franklin and Marshall. 
Despite a first place finish to start 
the meet in the 1000 free by firstyear Anna Kochalko, the oppos
ing swimmers were able to take 
places two through five to outscore the Tartans. After an impor
tant win by their A team in the 
200 medley relay in 1:53.83, the 
Diplomats pulled away by taking 
gold in the 50 free.
The Tartans were able to snap 
F&Ms streak of individual vic
tories in the 100 free as firstyear Lauren Connell held off 
Diplomat Jessica Nonemaker 
55.09 to 55.86. First-year Emily 
Tong repeated this feat in the 
100 back, surviving a challenge 
from Lisa Hertz to win 1:01.12 to 
1:01.79. However, the Diplomats 
soon extended their lead in the 
500 free, with Jenna Walters eas
ily outdistancing the field in a 
time of 5:18.94 for the Diplomats. 
Trailing 111-77, the women never 
gave up, with the A team finish
ing strong to win the 200 free 
relay in 1:43.63. Both the men 
and women will have a break in 
the action in the upcoming weeks 
to prepare for the UAA champion
ships in New York. They will be 
back in action February 9, as the 
mens team prepares for what will 
be a battle with nationally ranked 
Emory, who finished second at 
the national championships last 
year, and Johns Hopkins, who 
closed out their season in fifth 
place at nationals in 2004.
Mens basketball runs out of time in Atlanta
by Akil Simon
Junior Staffwriter
This past Friday the Tartans 
encountered another obstacle 
on their road to the top of the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) conference standings. 
Despite their best efforts, the 
Carnegie Mellon mens basketball 
team met defeat in Atlanta last 
weekend, dropping a close game 
to the Emory Eagles, 88-85. With 
this loss the Tartans fall to 12-4 
on the season and 4-2 in UAA 
play. They are now second in the 
conference. Emory improves to 
11-5 on the year and 3-3 in the 
conference.
In the first half of play, nei
ther team was dominant. Like 
past UAA matches of the Tartans, 
the game against Emory was 
close and hard-fought. Carnegie 
Mellon was able to close to within 
two points of the Eagles numer
ous times and Emory never led 
by a margin greater than seven 
points. The Tartans were able to 
even up the score many times in 
the half.
Carnegie Mellons only lead of 
the game came after Eliot Goren 
hit a jumper with 9:11 left to 
put the Tartans up 22-21. This 
lead was short-lived, however, 
after Emorys Chase Fawsett 
(24 points, seven rebounds) laid 
one in to regain the lead in favor 
of the Eagles. At the half, the 
score was Eagles 43, Tartans 41. 
This momentum carried into the 
locker room for Emory, as they
took control and fended off every 
Tartan surge in the second half. 
Carnegie Mellon was able to tie 
the score at 78 with just 5:21 
left in the game and again at 83 
with just over two minutes left, 
but Eagles senior guard Rashawn 
Allen hit a big three-pointer that 
sank the Tartans. Despite a great 
team effort, their final-minute 
surge fell short.
The game was close in many 
respects and, for the most part, 
the Tartans and the Eagles played 
comparably. Both teams had field 
goal percentages around 48 per
cent and both had similar num
bers in steals and blocks. Both 
teams also shot well from behind 
the three-point line  Emory 
shot 64 percent and the Tartans
49 percent  and combined for
18 total field goals. Carnegie 
Mellon was able to keep the 
Eagles chances of scoring behind 
the arc low. Coach Wingen has 
stated that the team has focused 
a great deal of energy on getting 
out on the shooters of opposing 
teams to hold three-point oppor
tunities to a minimum.
The Tartans were able to assert 
some dominance underneath, led 
by junior forwards Nate Maurer 
and Clayton Barlow-Wilcox, who 
led the team with nine rebounds 
apiece. For the game, the Tartans 
out-rebounded the Eagles 36-30. 
Unfortunately, it was foul trouble 
that put Carnegie Mellon at their 
greatest disadvantage. The Eagles 
were sent to the free-throw line 
twice as much as the Tartans 
throughout the game, attemptFile Photo
Junior Clayton Barlow-Wilcox had 28 points and nine rebounds Friday.
ing 30 foul shots compared to the 
Tartans 13. In such a close match 
between two talented organiza
tions, the number of times the 
players are sent to the line can 
make the difference between vic
tory and defeat.
The Tartans are far from being 
defeated, despite their most 
recent setback. With seven games
remaining in their schedule, 
Carnegie Mellon is still one of 
the top teams to contend with 
in the UAA. Success at home, 
over the next two weeks, can put 
the Tartans back in the direc
tion necessary for them to lead 
the conference and pull down 
an automatic NCAA Division III 
tournament bid.
Super Bowl provides plenty of tough matchups
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
With Super Bowl XXXIX only six 
days away, the recurring theme 
seems be dynasty versus destiny. 
Will this be the year Philadel
phia makes the leap from good 
team to great team, or will the 
Patriots become the first NFL dy
nasty since the Dallas Cowboys 
of the early 90s? Can Donovan 
McNabb continue to fight off 
the demons that haunted him 
in three straight conference title 
games, or will Tom Bradys nearly 
unprecedented playoff win streak 
reach nine games? A closer look 
at key position matchups could 
hold the answers to these ques
tions.
Quarterback: As far as sta
tistics go, McNabb has the clear
edge in every category, throw
ing for more yards, more touch
downs, and fewer interceptions, 
and running for almost ten times 
as many yards as Brady. How
ever, Brady is the guy with two 
Super Bowl MVP honors and is 
looking more and more like the 
Joe Montana of his generation. 
McNabb will bring a new aspect 
to the Eagles offense if he has 
success scrambling and wearing 
down the Patriots defensive line. 
However, in a situation like this, 
go with the guy who already has 
two rings. Edge: New England, but 
not by much.
Wide Receivers and Tight 
Ends: This matchup is com
pletely contingent on whether 
Terrell Owens can play and be 
effective. He has proven himself 
in big games in San Francisco 
and will give the Eagles a huge
edge over the Pats if he is healthy. 
Without Owens, the trio of 
Freddie Mitchell, Todd Pinkston, 
and Greg Lewis is equal to New 
Englands combination of Deion 
Branch, David Givens, and Troy

Mens track takes prize at 
Spartan meet on Saturday
by Drea Garvue
Layout Staff
This past Saturday, the Carn
egie Mellon mens track team 
kicked off their season by plac
ing first overall at the Spartan 
Invitational at Case Western 
Reserve University. The Tartans 
outdistanced other competing 
schools, including Case, Walsh, 
Penn State-Behrend, Fredonia, Cuyahoga, and Thiel Col
lege, with an impressive score of 
178 points. Penn State-Behrend 
was a distant second with 101. 
It was their first meet of the in
door season, since last weeks 
race at Denison University was 
canceled due to an unexpected 
snowstorm.
Highlights of the events in
cluded the finishes of the 4x400 
and 4x200 A teams, which both 
placed first in their respective 
events. With Nik Bonaddio, Mark 
Davis, Russel Verbofsky, and Eric 
Tang in the 4x200, coach Dario 
Donatelli had three out of the four 
members of the 4x400 team that 
made it to Nationals during last 
years outdoor season. This group 
has the ability to catch an incred
ible amount of ground in a short 
amount of time, making them an 
exciting team to watch. After fin
ishing the first leg, Tang forced his 
way through his competitors to 
hand off the baton to Verbofsky. 
Once Verbofsky had the baton for 
the second leg, Carnegie Mellon 
never trailed again and easily took 
first. Other top finishes for the 
men included Tom Matta, who 
recently set the Carnegie Mellon 
record in the weight throw, win
ning both the shot put and weight 
throw events; and Eric Tang, 
who earned a blue ribbon in the 
mens long jump with distance of 
20 feet, seven inches.
The mens mile race also was 
notable with Tartan harriers tak
ing home second, third, fourth, 
fifth, and sixth place finishes. It 
was hard to cut in [the first lane] 
because we got stuck behind a big 
pack right at the beginning. This 
made the pace of the rest of our 
race go slower than we had hoped 
for, and gave the guy in first place 
too much distance to catch up to 
at the end, said racers Dana Irrer 
(who finished second) and Ethan 
Coffey (third). One of the biggest
challenges for all runners is the 
fact that the air on an indoor track 
is dry and recycled. This causes 
constant dehydration and tends 
to give runners a hacking cough 
by the end of the event. This was 
a factor that Irrer, Coffey, and sev
eral other distance runners were 
able to combat, however, as they 
fought through the dry air to run 
the 5000-meter race shortly after 
finishing their mile. In that event, 
Mike Brindenbaugh finished in 
second place, scoring eight points 
for the Tartans.
Although Case Western was 
a small meet that only fielded 
six teams, it was a positive start 
to the teams season. This meet 
gives us something to work off of 
for the rest of the season, said 
Irrer. Next Saturday, Carnegie 
Mellon will be racing at Denison 
University in Ohio.
Womens track 
takes third at 
Spartan Invite
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
indoor track and field team 
had an impressive showing last 
Saturday, finishing third out of 
seven teams. The Tartans domi
nated the distance events, scoring 
35 of their 99 overall points in the 
mile and 5000 meter runs. Junior 
Jocelyn Sikora set the tone for the 
Tartans early, winning the mile 
in 5:16, a full 17 seconds ahead 
of the next closest competitor. In 
the 5000, junior Drea Garvue fin
ished in 18:56 to beat the field by 
over 40 seconds. Kate Hollabaugh 
(third), K.J. Helmsetter (fifth), 
Kelly Cronin (seventh) and Carrie 
Kmetko (eighth) all scored points 
in the event.
Senior Allison Spare and 
first-year Allison Hannan fin
ished second and third, respec
tively, in the pole vault. The 
womens 4x400 meter relay A team 
took home a third place finish. 
With the encouraging finish, the 
women hope to carry some of 
this momentum into their meet at 
Denison next Saturday.

Big Als Metal Review
Strapping Young Lad releases For Those Aboot to Rock DVD
Canadian rockers deliver powerful live footage from Commodore Ballroom.
Courtesy of www.strappingyounglad.com
As a red and white Canadian, it is my pleasure to 
present Vancouvers own Strapping Young Lad 
(SYL). Born from the chaotic mind of everyones 
favorite dirty uncle, Devin Townsends SYL has 
matured from a local band to an international 
metal phenomenon. Its been over a decade since 
Dev left Steve Vais band and put SYL together, 
albeit with various breaks and solo projects in 
between. In that time, the only common thread 
with SYLs output has been vulgar, loud, angry 
white noise with some melody thrown in for good 
measure. At times, SYL evokes the clangy, indus
trial color of, say, bands such as Skinny Puppy or 
even Meshuggah, which makes SYL uncomfort
able to listen to.
Nevertheless, they remain Canadas most vital 
metal band, and this poses a dilemma for rock 
radio programmers. Consider a track like Detox 
from the classic album City. Heavy, yes, and it 
grazes upon mainstream hook and melody. But 
as you get deeper into City, the soundscapes cre
ated evoke your worst nightmares, which is won
derful fodder for selling beer and condoms.
Since choosing cuts from an SYL album for radio 
singles is not the easiest task, SYL have built their 
fan base from the underground up. And just like 
Pantera, Metallica, Anthrax, and any other metal 
giants that made it on their own as far as radio is 
concerned, live is where its at.
Strapping Young Lads last (and self-titled) album 
took its listeners around the world and back 
again to lovely Vancouver. And what better place 
to record their first ever live DVD, eh? Even bet
ter, it was filmed at the beautiful Commodore 
Ballroom, which was once an elegant showcase 
for Vancouvers elite dancers (no, not that kind, 
but the citys got lots of those too). The floor of 
the Commodore Ballroom is equipped with a 
spring system that provides bouncy fun for all,
especially if you like moshing. All of the perfor
mance action is on display in the For Those Aboot 
To Rock DVD.
Using split screen cinematography to capture all 
of the action, For Those Aboot To Rock is by all 
means a professionally shot DVD. Promo videos 
and interviews are goodies that are thrown in to 
round out the DVD, but the live show is where 
its at. Opening with Dire and segueing into 
Consequence, the band leaps into their set with 
fury. As Dev burns his trailer-park-physics-prof 
look into your retinas, the background is kept 
simple: Blood-red banner from the last album 
behind the band, frothing-at-the-mouth fans in 
front of them. Of course, Strapping Young Lad 
plays all their hits, including Detox and All 
Hail the New Flesh, and Devin insults the crowd, 
to their delight.
The mighty Gene Hoglan keeps it all together 
from behind his kit. Not to mention the fact 
that they also have two of metals finest in Jed 
Simon and Byron Stroudon on stage with them 
during the performance. Watching the interplay 
between band members is definitely a highlight 
of the show; seeing how they keep themselves in 
check as their frontman seethes behind his guitar 
is very entertaining.
As I type this, an advance of their latest album, 
Alien, assaults my ears. Not to spill any details 
lets just say its the evolution youd expect. More 
on this album in March, and keep your eyes out 
for their show here at the Rex Theatre on April 
15.
See ya soon.

A night at the opera
CFAs production of LItaliana in Algeri proves that opera can be funny and entertaining
This past weeks performance of Lltaliana inAlgeri (The 
Italian Girl in Algiers) proved to be a surprising break 
from the traditional conception of an opera. Not only 
was the opera humorous, but surprisingly, no one died. 
Gioacchino Rossini composed the music for Lltaliana in 
Algeri, a comedy, in 1813, but this production costumed 
the singers in the style of 1920s gangsters and flappers
 another surprising deviation from the idea of what 
an opera is supposed to be. The opera was also more 
accessible to a collegiate audience because it had English 
translations of the Italian projected on a screen above the 
stage. The opera singers produced many comical moments 
with impressive ease, even while singing in Italian. The 
humor of the opera combined with the dynamic stage 
direction prevented it from dragging too much, despite 
its length of nearly three hours.
The first scene of the opera opens on a group of women in 
silver-curled wigs dressing by a mirror. One of the women,
opening scenes are the performances of the male and 
female choruses, who continue to help the scenes coher
ence throughout the show. Usually an overlooked ele
ment of a production, the male and female choruses do a 
fine job of providing comedy with amusing facial expres
sions and gestures. Yet both of the choruses gracefully 
stop short of stealing the main actors thunder.
Mustafa crushes his wifes hopes and pleas without a 
second glance and demands that she marry an Italian 
slave, Lindoro (Tyler Ruebensaal), so that he may then 
remarry another woman once Elvira is safely on a ship to 
Italy. Elvira, who is never seen without her maid Zulma 
(Alice Tellers), feels shocked and helpless in the position 
that her husband has put her in. She wants her husband 
to love her but he is only concerned with accumulating 
more prestige as a great seducer  the truth of which his 
entourage asserts several times. Both Mustafa and Haly 
(Joshua Mulkey), the main member of his Turkish-mafiaesque entourage, are quite comical and complement each 
other well during their duets.

In his attempts to woo Isabella, the Bey is very determined to get time alone with her.
the only brunette, is revealed to be the wife of the Bey of 
Algiers (ruler of the Ottomans). Instantly, the audience 
becomes involved in the storyline as Elvira bemoans her 
husbands lack of affection for her. Though Mustafa, the 
Bey, is already a wealthy ruler with a well-stocked harem, 
he is in pursuit of a beautiful Italian woman. In fact, he 
is perfectly willing to abandon his wife for his new love 
interest. Mustafa is faced with a predicament, as he sings 
in a rich voice full of self-appreciation: He cannot cast 
out his wife so immorally but at the same time, he cannot 
take another wife while still married to Elvira (Samantha 
Grenell-Zaidman).
Mustafa, played by David Murray during the Thursday 
and Saturday productions, has a very strong voice and 
excellently provides comic relief. From the opening scene, 
he appears a conceited and pompous man with nothing 
better to do than try to conquer a foreign race notorious 
for its fiery women. What is most impressive about the
Mustafa is so confused by his love that he resorts desperate 
measures.

---------------------------------------------------

Several of the women from Isabellas homeland must help her gain the strength to face her Turkish cator.
Robert Kaminski/Photo Editor
The second thread of the plot is revealed when Lindoro, 
the Italian slave, appears. He has been captured by Mus
tafa and working in his household for some months, but 
he pines for his love far away in Italy. While Haly searches 
for an Italian woman to marry to the selfish Mustafa, Haly 
is struck with fortune. A ship full of Italians wrecks with 
a lovely woman on board  Lindoros love  Isabella. 
Isabella (Rebekah Diaz) not only fits her role well by us
ing her sexy attitude to warp mens minds, but she is also 
an extremely talented singer. Her voice is quite clear and 
strong throughout her many numbers, but her comedic 
moments are not as strong as those created by Murray 
and Mulkey.
The first act of Lltaliana in Algeri is performed with un
failing skill. Among the most memorable moments is the 
introduction of Isabella. Diaz delivers the attitude and 
voice expected from the female lead as the rest of the cast 
supports her performance spectacularly. There is a hilari
ous scene in which the entirety of Mustafas clan falls into 
a swoon due to the presence of the beautiful Isabella. 
Murray does an amazing job during his first interaction 
with Isabella. Though he does not sing through the first 
portion of the scene, his goo-goo eyes and gaping mouth 
speak as much as any lyrics would. The first act ends with 
a bang as all the main characters go temporarily insane 
while attempting to untangle all the threads of the differ
ent love triangles.
!While the first act seems quick and full of punch, the second 
act suffers from more of a drag. The plot progresses when
Isabella and Lindoro (played by Christopher Moyer in the 
second act) reunite. There are still some side-splitting 
moments in the second half of the opera but the songs 
seem to last longer and have less impact in terms of humor 
and beauty. One great addition appearing in the second 
act is Taddeo (Patrick McNully) who is gifted with a great 
voice and skillfully plays the role of a self-absorbed, limpwristed stooge. Though Taddeo is technically Isabellas 
suitor, she obviously has no interest in him. His songs are 
more lyrically humorous compared to other songs that 
depend on the actions or faces of the characters to create 
humor. He spends the majority of the play under the 
impression that Isabella loves him and is only concocting 
her elaborate plans in order to help free the other captive 
Italians and be with him  not Lindoro.
The opera ends with all the greatest elements of the first 
act, despite having lost some momentum. Isabella has 
managed to con Mustafa into becoming a Pappatacci, a 
term for a man who grants his women complete freedom. 
His duties include being able to see and not see, hear 
and not hear. Her ploy works, and she, Lindoro, and the 
other Italian slaves manage to escape before Mustafa re
alizes the scheme. Elvira, who Isabella kindly takes under 
her wing during her time with Mustafa, returns to find 
that her husband sees her as a much better wife than he 
once believed.
The last two or three songs of the production are quite 
dynamic. The male chorus, Mustafa, Taddeo, Isabella, 
and Lindoro sing a lengthy song about the roles of the
Pappatacci. During the song, Lindoro and Isabella can 
barely control their emotions; the entire proceeding is 
absurd. Mustafa commands the scene once again; though 
the other performers are quite good, Murrays face and 
gestures are all very large and convey perfectly whatever 
emotion he is experiencing. When Taddeo pronounces 
his new title, Murray opens his arms wide and seems to 
sigh the word in echo: Pappatacci
Lltaliana in Algeri proved to be a successful, energetic 
comedy. Its consistent comic flare never broke for a mo
ment  there are no scenes that are particularly seri
ous. Though no one in the cast seemed to lack in terms 
of vocal performance, there was no doubt that Murray, 
Diaz, and McNally were the most dynamic characters. 
The opera itself was performed with style: witty songs, 
marvelous staging and blocking of the actors, and eye
catching expressiveness all contributed to the success of 
the production. Though it was a long performance and 
would have been maddening had the subject matter been 
dying Viking lords, it was instead an opera that shined 
with humor, grace, and a little off-beat and underplayed 
romanticism.

Weekend Factory at the Warhol
Museum visitors experiment with the techniques of the popular culture icon
Remember when you were six, and every piece of paper 
you scribbled on was a piece of art? Chances are that 
these masterpieces have been taken off the refrigerator 
at home and replaced by overloaded schedules and old 
plastic magnets. Dont worry though. If the door of your 
refrigerator is looking a little shabby, the Andy Warhol 
Museum can help you add some visual spice to fill that 
void.
The Andy Warhol Museum draws from the lifestyle and 
works of the 20th centurys most famous pop artist, Andy 
Warhol. The Weekend Factory is an open studio where 
visitors of all ages can use various materials and tech
niques to create small works of art inspired by Warhols 
studio, the Silver Factory. Art educators and volunteers 
from local colleges and universities, including Carnegie 
Mellon University, help visitors-turned-artists imitate 
some of the same processes Warhol used to create his 
most famous works of art.
We want people to learn by doing and talking to an 
educator about the processes Warhol went through, 
says Maritza Mosquera, assistant curator of education at 
the museum. Since the beginning of the Weekend Fac
tory, which coincided with the opening of the museum
10 years ago, the idea of learning by doing has helped 
people of all ages become momentary Warhols.
The basement of the Warhol houses a small, dimly lit 
room with tables covered in white paper and art supplies. 
When you walk into this room, you will find a friendly 
staff of two art educators and two volunteers who offer 
an introduction to the weekends activities. The activities 
change from week to week as each new project emulates 
a different technique once employed by Warhol himself.
This past weekends projects were reminiscent of both 
Warhols shoe advertisements and his ink-blotting proj
ects. Stamps, scrap papers, and glue sticks covered one 
set of tables. The staff explained this project very simply: 
Using the materials provided, create a 2D representa
tion of a decorative shoe. One completed piece was an 
outline of a high-heeled shoe filled in with torn pieces of 
construction paper. After a half hour of working and so
cializing, the artist left with a rainbow shoe, content with 
her piece and having visibly enjoyed the experience.
India ink, watercolor paints, and tracing and watercolor 
paper covered another table at which artists could cre
ate compositions by blotting inked lines and watercolor 
paints. Artists at this table copied images onto a sheet of 
tracing paper and then, going over the lines in India ink, 
blotted the inked image onto watercolor paper. The artKevin Anderson/Photo Staff

to create their own Warhols.
ists then filled in the image with color using the paints. 
Most artists at this table chose to trace images of cats, 
including brothers Zack (14) and Andrew (6) Scott of
Scottdale. Both agreed the activity was fun, and An
drew added, Its pretty easy!
Think you wouldnt know what to do? Think its not for 
you? I see a lot of people surprising themselves, says 
Mosquera. The staff is informative and helpful. We try 
to make sure that people are satisfied with their work, 
but really its up to them what they make. We try to be 
more encouraging than directive; we dont design [the 
project] for them.
Mosqueras suggestion that the Weekend Factory would 
make a great idea for a date was supported by at least 
three separate couples creating their own works of art. 
Friends of Amanda Walsh, a recent graduate of Kent 
State University, and Brian Poliak, a senior at KSU, rec
ommended the couple make a trip to the Warhol. While 
at the museum, Walsh and Poliak decided to participate 
in the Weekend Factory. Were the projects fun for the 
couple? Yes. [And] it helps to get the whole feel of the 
museum, says Walsh.
The Weekend Factory is meant to help add to the under
standing of Warhols artistic techniques and the pop art 
genre as a whole. Warhol was about what is current; 
popular culture. We want to make sure that we remind 
people that its not about the sixties and seventies but 
2004, 2005  what is current. We want them to know 
that that idea of current is constant, says Mosquera. 
The best part of the program is that participants of the 
workshop have the opportunity to create something us
ing materials and ideas from Warhols art, but can incor
porate present-day influences, just as Warhol drew from 
his influences while simultaneously pushing forward in 
artistic innovation.
The fun part about the projects at the Weekend Factory 
extends beyond the experimentation and artistic learn
ing processes involved. Although its amazing to watch 
each persons newly-discovered inner artist let loose, 
the staff finds it even more satisfying to watch the col
laboration between friends and family. When people get 
to work on something unique, they come together. The 
people who tend to enjoy this the most are those who 
didnt know they could make art, or those already fasci
nated with Warhol, says Mosquera. The Weekend Fac
tory, geared toward college-age students, engages that 
little kid in everyone  the part of us that still wants to 
hang something on the fridge.

Taj Mahal cooks up Indian Food
Proof that there are good Indian restaurants in the Burgh, if you can get there
Indian food is approaching the level of a culinary art 
in America. Twenty years ago, very few Americans had 
ever tried it. Ten years ago, the only places you could get 
it were dingy curry houses where the food was cheap 
takeoutand Indian food in Pittsburgh is just getting past 
this stage. Of course there are still the ubiquitous places 
which have spiciness on a scale of one to ten and where 
unpleasant waiters serve overcooked food. Thankfully, 
The Taj Mahal is not one of those places. The Taj Mahal 
takes Indian food and elevates it to the status it deserves 
as a complex culinary tradition.
The Taj Mahal has recendy changed its name from Sitar, 
although the old menus are still there and the restaurant 
looks exacdy the same as it did before. The change has 
essentially meant only a new sign, as the restaurant has 
kept its pleasant interior. It is one of the few Indian res
taurants in which I see Indians eating and enjoying their 
food. The walls, rather than featuring tacky exoticized 
art for westerners, have a few tasteful paintings. The 
booths are spacious and private and the dining room has 
always been surprisingly empty every time I have visited. 
Perhaps people are unwilling to make the trek to High
land Park. Their loss, as the Taj Mahal is good for more 
than just takeout.
The Taj Mahal's menu proudly proclaims that it does not 
cook with any saturated fats, thereby eliminating Indian 
ingredients such as ghee (clarified butter) from the cook
ing process. All of the food is also made to order, caus
ing a small delay in serving time. However, if you need 
help with the menu, the friendly wait staff will help you 
navigate it.
Indian food, like Chinese, is meant to be shared. You 
should never go to an Indian restaurant with friends 
who dont like to share because you will get stuck eating 
the same old thing. Dishes such as yellow dal and palak 
panneer are boring as main dishes but fabulous as one 
of the many things you consume over the course of the 
evening. In truth, the menu is a bit more comprehensive 
than other restaurants, so if you are new to this, dont be 
afraid to ask for help.
The table was set with the usual pappadams (spiced crispy 
lentil crackers) and a trio of sauces, green coriander 
chutney, sweet tamarind chutney, and some chopped 
pickled onions. The pappadams were some of the best 
I have had, light and crunchy like potato chips, and 
my companions quickly devoured a couple of baskets 
while trying out the possible sauce combinations. For an 
appetizer I chose the chana chaat, a personal favorite, 
which combines chickpeas and crunchy crackers in a 
tamarind and yogurt sauce. Usually the chaat is an 
interesting mix of soft and crunchy, sweet and hot. This 
time, though, it seemed that although all the ingredients 
were present, the extra oomph wasnt there. But that 
doesnt reflect on Sitars other dishes: The vegetarian 
appetizer sampler is fantastic, not too greasy, and an 
excellent example of similar Indian snacks.
For a main dish I chose the vegetable korma, a thick 
blend of vegetables and nuts in a creamy sauce. My 
friend chose prawns cooked in spinach, a dish which was 
fabulous although the Indian name escapes me. The fact 
that prawns (as well as goat) were on the menu was a 
bit of a surprise; thats quite a rare feat on any menu in 
Pennsylvania. The prawns were succulent in their spin
ach sauce and bursting with flavor to complement the 
creamy spinach. Another friends fish, red from the tandoor, was well flavored with tandoori spices, making the 
usual mild taste of the fish more interesting. I strongly 
recommend that you order bread, as well, because get
ting the bread basket enables people to get away from or
dering the usual garlic naan. I also recommend the rod, 
a thin, flat wheat bread that goes well with Indian food 
but doesnt ruin your appetite for rice the way a single 
helping of garlic naan does.
True to the claims on the menu, all of the food at the 
Taj Majal was both fresher and healthier than that of 
other Indian restaurants. The food was presented in 
small round dishes lit underneath by candles so that 
the food would stay bubbling hot. The portion sizes are 
generous (I can only eat half of one) and the rice is fresh 
and plentiful. To my dismay, the Taj Mahal has a very 
poor selection of beers and wines, but thankfully they are 
a BYOB establishment. (Indian restaurants arent really 
famous for their cocktails anyway.) The dessert menu 
has the old Indian standbys kulfi and gulabjamun. If you 
have never tried Indian desserts, the Taj Mahal does a 
fair job of it, but the results are not as spectacular as the 
main dishes.
While the Taj Mahal menu features the same North In
dian standards as many other establishments, they put 
time and care into the preparation of their dishes that 
you just cant find anywhere else. The prices at the Taj 
Mahal are comparable to those of other restaurants, but 
the Taj Mahal manages to produce dishes bursting with 
flavor and delicately spiced rather than reducing Indian 
food to variants of the same over-spiced mush. I know its 
out of the way for most CMU students, but if you have 
ever wondered what people are talking about when they 
rave about Indian food, or if you love Indian food enough 
to know that restaurants near campus arent doing it jus
tice, I recommend you find a day to take a bus down to 
Highland Park and give the Taj Mahal a try.
KitTan danZns 
hsnooc,tsW,Bradford L. Yankiver/Executive Officer
Taj Mahal produces a series of classic aromatic dishes to please any Indian food lover. Excellent presentation ensures a pleasant 
dining experience for all diners who choose to make the trek out to Highland Park.

Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
Musicians, conductors, and instruments flow together at Heinz Hall
Any person who stepped into Heinz Hall at 8 pm on 
Saturday was transported away from Pittsburghs slushon-the-ground, snow-on-your-coat city streets and 
into the 17th century. Traveling along was conductor 
Nicholas McGegan, mezzo-soprano Monica Groop, and 
nothing less than the beautiful music of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra.
It was of great fortune that I managed to find a seat; 
Pittsburgh did not disappoint in turning out for Bright 
Baroque, an event that was only available for two con
secutive evenings. People of all musical backgrounds 
were present, from the connoisseurs who argued during 
intermission over which composer was best to the novice 
listeners who closed their eyes and smiled as the music 
reached their ears.
The performance began with an introduction of Nicholas 
McGegan, the music director of the San Franciscobased Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra (named Musical 
Americas 2004 Ensemble of the Year) and Artistic 
Director of Germanys International Handel Festival

Gottingen. This is a man whose achievements, on both 
an international level and national one, are far too long 
to list, yet he delighted the audience with a humble sense 
of humor giving an insightful introduction to pieces 
before conducting them.
The symphony starts off with George Friedrich Handels 
Suite No. 1 in F Major from Water Music. Of the three 
suites, the flute Suite in G is perhaps the most inti
mately scored compared to the horn Suite in F and 
trumpet Suite in D; it is believed that the former was 
for King Georges suppertime entertainment, while the 
latter made outdoor music fit for voyages along the 
Thames River. Most notable of the twelve selections are 
Adagio e staccato, Andante, and Air, all three of which are 
rather slow and make good use of the oboe. McGegan 
also arranged two pieces himself, the Allegro and the 
Alla Hornpipe.
Special guest Finnish mezzo-soprano Monica Groop is 
paired with Mr. McGegan, and it only takes her first few 
notes in the second half before the intermission to see why 
she has performed with such internationally renowned 
opera companies as the Covent Garden, Munich State 
Opera, Royal Opera of Stockholm, Los Angeles Opera, 
and Paris Opera; her voice is stunningly beautiful, as she 
sings her way through Johann Sebastian Bachs Cantata 
No. 170. Noteworthy moments included the wandering, 
highly chromatic vocal line and the removal of the usual 
bass line in Baroquial music, creating a foundationless 
wayward spirit within the song. Special attention was 
drawn to word painting in the lines So flieht mein 
Herze (Thus feels my heart) by Groops ascending 
vocal lines in reinforcing the meaning of the text.
The piece was scored for alto solo, flute, organ, strings, 
and the rarely-heard doublereed-family oboe damore. 
One member of the Orchestra stepped in front of the 
audience, holding the Baroque-made-famous instru
ment. Caught in an identity crisis between a normal 
oboe and the larger English longhorn, the oboe damore 
is pitched at A unlike its smaller counterpart the oboe 
at pitch C and the larger English longhorn at pitch F. 
As she finished, she joked that a colleague was nice 
enough to point outthe oboe damore is, in a dictionary, 
also roughly equidistant from obnoxious and obsolete. I 
imagine the player can be obnoxious, but hopefully this 
instrument will never be obsolete. The oboe damore is 
an instrument rarely ever used in non-Baroquial music 
due to its unique sound, and thus is quickly becoming 
forgotten.
After intermission, the musical selections turned to 
Arcangelo Corellis Concerto Grosso, Opus 6, No. 4, D

Major. Scored for strings and harpsichord, the piece is 
one that can accurately exemplify the majestic, sub
lime, and solemn effects of Baroque music. The Adagio 
Allegro features a quick-firing movement, in which the 
first and second violins bounce a quick pattern back 
and forth to create a seamless sound. The Vivace and 
Allegro were filled with a dance-like theme, a vibrant 
and powerful sound that resonated throughout until the 
very end.
The program concluded with Jean-Philippe Rameaus 
Orchestra Suite from Nais (ed. Nicholas McGegan). 
Before starting, the conductor remarked that the Nai's 
was a French play in celebration of their victory at the 
October 1748 signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. 
The opera is symbolic of this war and its conclusion, 
with an epic battle waged between the gods and the 
Titans. Incorporated in the original were sounds of thun
der and earthquakes, created with cannonballs rolled 
above the heads of listeners. McGegan joked that those

cannonballs often ended up in the laps or on the heads 
of the audience in a not-so-graceful manner, and thus, 
to make it a bit more safe for modern times, the thunder 
and earthquake sounds have been replaced by a giant fan 
to replicate wind. Even without the sound effects, it is 
easy to see why Rameau is famous for his bold melodies, 
daring harmonies, and how his music is among the most 
dramatic and compelling works of the Baroque era. Of 
the ten selections, the Entre Majesteuse and Tambourins 
1 & 2 are amazing, projecting a tone and atmosphere that 
makes the body want to get up and celebrate just like the 
actors in the opera did.
The musicians were professionals, each humbly tak
ing their bows. During the intermission and end, both 
McGegan and Groop signed CDs as fans expressed their 
amazement. On the 28th, the entire ensemble gathered 
across the street in a bar, inviting the audience to join 
them for conversations and refreshments.
Thankfully, this is not the end. The symphony is host
ing Carnegie Mellon Night at the Symphony on 
February 12. The concert, titled Sounds of Freedom, 
will be performed February 11 and 12 at 8 pm in Heinz
Hall. Sir Andrew Davis is one of Britains foremost con
ductors, performing not only internationally but also 
on television. Along with him is world-renowned Sarah 
Chang, a violinist signed with EMI Records. Since learn
ing to play at age four, she has received countless awards 
and played with many famous international symphonies; 
and it will not take long for anyone to see why. It is a rare 
chance to listen to such amazing music, and there is no 
reason to pass it up. Countless people return for more, 
and it is this patronage that brings these wonderfully-talented individuals to perform in Pittsburgh and prevents 
music, like the oboe damore, from becoming obsolete.
The ticket prices start at $12 and go up to $25, and stu
dents are to either obtain information or buy tickets from 
the UC info desk or contact Group Sales at 412.392.4819 
(10+ people for group discount). There will also be a 
dessert reception for all students, staff, and faculty after 
the concert. For more information, visit the Pittsburgh

Health and fitness on campus
How to maintain healthy lifestyles and diets on campus for busy students
fit  ness: n. The state of being fit
Freshman fifteen. Sophomore ten. These infamous phrases have be
come exclusive to our college jargon as unsuspecting Carnegie Mellon 
students consume midnight munchies from vending machines, fried 
foods at the O, and strawberry milkshakes from Andys. During col
lege, most students caloric intakes reach a threshold far above the rec
ommended daily nutritional values, causing their weight to skyrocket. 
Suddenly  Whabam! You notice that the walk between Porter Hall 
and Hunt Library seems further than usual. When your clothes seem 
to have shrunk in the dryer, you start sporting the baggy sweats look. 
Gradually, you realize that even the most cautious student is not im
mune to the perils of gaining the dreadful baggage weight that you 
were warned about by the college survival books. In the most severe 
case, you need a chip that will administer special shocks to combat your 
couch-potato tendencies.
But rewind for a moment. This dismal scenario need not be acted out 
in its entirety. Regardless of whether you are a victim of the Freshman 
15 or some other group in the great void, brace yourself for the hot
test new imaginary club in the neighborhood: Club SCOTER (Students 
Crossing Over To Eat/Exercise Right).
Carnegie Mellon University, renowned for its culturally diverse com
munity, is also composed of students with varying fitness levels. Visit
ing the gym, whether it be Skibo or the University Center, is a daily 
routine for many students, while others choose to sit in front of their 
television and consume tubs of double chocolate fudge ice cream. Tyler 
Paulk, an electrical and computer engineering student, believes that 
exercise is essential for a healthy lifestyle. Its hard to be physically ac
tive, but it helps me feel better after I exercise, says Paulk, who is also 
in the ROTC program. In addition to the required physical trainings on 
Monday and Wednesday mornings, Paulk also lifts weights, runs on the 
treadmill, and uses the bikes in the gym for half-hour increments. On 
the opposite spectrum, first year Connie Au goes to the gym whenever 
she feels like it. Is this attributable to the pressures of adjusting to col
lege life? Not quite. Au admits she is just too lazy to go.
Other methods of maintaining an active lifestyle at CMU include swim
ming, dancing, and team sports. Sabrina Dhanani, a sophomore chemi
cal and biomedical engineering student, participates in intramural soc
cer and baseball. According to Dhanani, who works as a desk attendant 
for the gym facilities in the University Center, the peak gym hours are 
from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Overall, she said, the students at CMU are not 
very fit mainly because a lot of people dont have the time or motiva
tion. However, the few who are dedicated come all the time. Kristan 
Hoffman, an avid dancer since the age of three, concurs with Dhananis 
viewpoint, singling out time as the main culprit for the slump in stu
dent physical fitness. Just in general, if youre at CMU, then youre tak
ing classes, youre involved with clubs, and have some sort of social life 
as well, which makes it difficult to schedule in [exercise]. She says that 
the key is to just start small. For example, take the stairs instead of the 
elevator. Dont let yourself be lazy. If youre tempted to be [lazy], just 
get up and go.

---------------------------------------------------

But exercise is not the only component in the fitness equa
tion. We are what we eat. Just think of your body as a car
- how about a sexy blue BMW Z4? You wouldnt fill it up 
with sawdust; you would fuel her up with the best that 
your economy permits! Likewise, its important to main
tain your health with the finest fuel available. Youve seen 
all the cliched programs and publications on healthy eat
ing. Now is the time to take action. Presently, the big 
question that remains is: What if campus food is the only 
option for me? How could I possibly eat healthy amidst 
the sea of fatty, sugary foods? Elementary, my dear Wat
son! In fact, its much easier than using your brain cells to 
inspect food labels for caloric and carbohydrate content.
Donna Hansen, a registered dietician at CMUs Health 
Services, says, One of the mistakes students make is that 
they dont realize there are other options around [besides 
salad]. You just have to be willing to explore and mix 
things up to get variety. She explained, You cant live on 
salad and yogurt because you get overly hungry and start 
binge-eating. Then you start to feel bad and revert back 
to salad and yogurt. This creates a vicious cycle, so youre 
better off having a sandwich, a piece of fruit, and milk 
instead. The best advice that Hansen offers students is 
eating at regular intervals, limiting the consumption of 
alcohol, caffeine, pizza, and simple sugars (e.g. candy 
bars and donuts), and above all, making a conscious 
effort to drink six to eight cups of water daily. She also 
stresses the importance of consuming protein before 
exams to increase alertness levels, and cautions against 
sleep-inducing carbohydrates. Voila! So now that the 
answer is clear, go out, explore, and plan what you will 
be feeding your personal BMW Z4 today!
Sleep is a commonly neglected area in fitness for CMU 
students, who are notorious for pulling all-nighters. 
Anita Barkin, Director of CMUs Health Services, says 
that sleep is an important part of staying healthy because 
it improves mental efficiency, alertness, metabolism, 
and coordination. Furthermore, sleeping is when your 
body undergoes hormone regulation. Thus, the amount 
of sleep you get during the night dictates how well your 
body functions during the day. To promote better sleeping 
patterns, Barkins advice is, You dont want to exercise 
before you sleep because it increases your endorphin 
levels. Exercising in the afternoon yields more optimal 
results because your metabolic rates increase during 
exercise so at night you can cool off.
However, for some people, this is easier said than done. 
Many students toss and turn into the night until they 
finally get tangled in their own web of sheets, pillows, 
and comforters. Even then, sleep does not come easily. 
The ticking of alarm clocks and the droning sound of
the refrigerator seem to increase by 500,000 decibels a 
second, making it difficult to remain in your bed and drift 
into sleep. For those who are thinking, hey, that sounds 
like me, Dr. Barkin says, At night, in order to fall asleep, 
you have to cool down your core body temperature. 
Hence, sleeping and exercising are related more closely 
than most people suspect.
Developing a healthy lifestyle begins with healthy 
habits. As Barkin believes, fitness requires good mainte
nance and servicing to yield high-level performance. Its 
not about being perfect. Its about general goals you de
velop that you can stick to and follow through. It doesnt 
matter whether you walk, run, or do yoga. You should just 
pick an exercise routine you thoroughly enjoy. But then, 
what about people who dont even have eight minutes to 
spare? The solution lies in 10,000 steps. The Spring 2005 
Fitness Challenge, which started on January 23 and ends 
on March 6, encourages people to go out and exercise for 
20 minutes a day, or take 10,000 steps a day, for at least

style is a topic that needs to be emphasized more frequently. 
Without your health, how can you be the worlds leading 
physicist and conquer the world with your Theory of Ev
erything, while simultaneously leading a campaign to 
become the most eminent celebrity in Hollywood? Hav
ing knowledge and leadership skills will not help you avoid 
health problems, which is why it is important to go out, run 
those miles, swim those laps, and fuel your body with the 
best there is.
Nothing is impossible, and if you are really scrunched for 
time, take the stairs, walk the extra five steps by taking the 
scenic route to your class, and grab a Naked juice. Youve 
heard what our very own CMU superstars and health ex
perts have to say about fitness. Now go out and make your 
own. There is no rule in Club SCOTER maintaining that you 
must run five miles a day and eat a salad three times a day in 
order to be fit. Its a matter of finding out what works for you, 
making a plan, and following through. Discipline and want
ing to be healthy is all that is required to become a member 
of Club SCOTER. After all, if Helen Keller could attend col
lege, author almost a dozen books, travel abroad, meet 12 
U.S. Presidents, and live to be 87, surely you can easily adopt 
a healthier lifestyle. Now what are you waiting for? Go out 
and get your SCOTER on!

four days a week. Barkin maintains, Getting people to take 
more steps each day and ideally coming close to 10,000 steps 
will allow them to still get the benefits of exercise. Just doing 
this will improve cardiovascular health and help in terms of 
weight management. People who want to live healthy but 
need a pointer on where to start should consult Kristine Cecchetti, CMUs very own health educator, and see what Peer 
Health Advisors (PHA) can do for you. Specially trained in 
the Baccus Gamma Program, these students hold sessions for 
stress management, nutrition, and topics on alcohol. So stay
ing fit is not impossible. Developing healthy habits is easier 
than disguising an elephant in a bunny suit!
Now how does everything fit into Club SCOTER? First off, 
SCOTER is neither a club that exists downtown where all 
your friends party on the weekends, nor is it an actual or
ganization on campus. Club SCOTER is a mentality  a 
fitness mentality. Its a way of life. By eating healthy, ex
ercising normally, and sleeping regularly, youre eligible 
for an imaginary lifetime membership in Club SCOTER: 
where individuals inspire fitness through example.
Sadly enough, fitness is an underrepresented issue in our 
community. Although academics are important in the 
Carnegie Mellon University culture, leading a healthy life

Groundhog Day
Spla5l.amM ,Av4Av6T
Dont you wish you could go back in time some days and just fix all those 
mistakes and goofs that you made the day before? Well, it happens for Bill 
Murray, as a weather man covering the holiday in the 1993 movie Groundhog 
Day. But dont get too excited. Repeating the same day over, and over, and 
over, and... well, over again, can get a bit tiring. But Murray still lives up to his 
funnyman status and plays the perfect cynic. Its hilarious to see how Murray 
tries to deal with the same situations in different ways. The movie will make 
you laugh and feel fuzzy all over. Then you will want to see it over and over 
and over again.
Baadasssss
Sf9wu.amM ,Av4Av6T
With a name like Baadasssss, you cant help but stretch out that last s. This 
movie is a sons homage to his famous father who set the path for indepen
dent black cinema. Mario Van Peebles plays his father, Melvin Van Peebles, 
who led an incredibly controversial life. He was one of the first black men 
to accept an award from a top film festival, and was the first director to 
introduce an onscreen black ghetto hero to the public. This film inspires and 
shows the obstacles one man had to overcome to follow a dream.
Team America: World Police
Ssu1amM ,Av4Av6c
Our favorite team of cartoon pranksters has done it again. Anybody who is 
anyone is satirized in this movie. Members of Team America, an interna
tional police force, dedicate their lives to global stability. They must protect 
the world from the evil plans of Kim Jong II by any means necessary. The 
movie also boasts an all-star cast, including the likes of Tim Robbins, Helen 
Hunt, and George Clooney, among others. Too bad theyre all puppets. Youll 
laugh, youll cry, and youll be grossed out by puppets being fed to animals.
Shark Tale
SFmiwuamM ,Av4Av6T
Who hasnt seen an animated fish movie? Who hasnt seen Robert De Niro as 
a mob boss? Well Shark Tale is both of those things, and it's set in the sea to 
boot. Oscar, played by Will Smith, gets in trouble with the sea underworlds 
mafia when he is found near the site where the mob bosss son was killed. Os
car suddenly becomes known as the sharkslayer, the fish that provides hope 
to all the other little fishes. Too bad he didnt realize all the consequences 
beforehand, and the fact that little fishes are typically eaten by big fishes. The 
movie has everything going for it, including a stellar voice cast with the likes 
of De Niro, Smith, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, and Jack Black. If only 
Shark Tale had the quality story writing of Finding Nemo, it would be half as 
engaging.
Badlands
SFw5amM ,Av4Av6T
When your parents disagree with your choice of love interest, the only way 
to make them agree with it is to kill them. Then you have to kill some more 
people along the way as you run through the Midwest. At least, thats the ap
proach taken in Badlands. This movie is from the early years of Martin Sheen 
and Sissy Spacek and is easily a classic. If nothing else, you will be entranced 
by the cinematography. Since this movie is a true story and based on two real 
characters, you can learn from their mistakes: never get in the way of two 
lovestruck people. You just might get killed.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pondO
It seemed to Wilbur that more snow collected in Conneaut Valley than in any 
other place he knew. With so much snow in such a small town, there was no 
place to put it all. Empty lots were piled high as the buildings on either side of 
them with mountains of snow. One of these buildings happened to belong to 
Carlow Brack, the only travel agent in town. Actually, a quick Google search 
proved he was the only travel agent within 50 miles. As he walked to the office, 
Wilbur decided that Carlow must be pretty good if he was the only competition 
around. 1 have to get out of here! he said, as he crossed the icy street to the 
travel agents office. The windows were decorated with posters of jungles, beaches, 
fake parrots, and sunglasses. Hissing neon lights lined the display. Wilbur was 
a shy duck and was always awkward when meeting new people. He hesitated 
in the orange glow of the neon and thought of his tropical vacation. Then a 
cold wind blew into the doorway, reminding him where he was. A chill made 
the feathers on the back of his neck stand up, and he ducked inside the office.

HOROSCOPES.
BY ASHLEIGH MOLZ
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): This is the most crucial point in your path 
to a successful future. If you find someone is in the way of your career or 
academics, hire a hit man.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Ignore your psychiatrist; the stars say that you 
should obey the voices in your head today.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): It's time for you to take a break. Have some 
real fun this weekend. As in, get out of your dorm for once!
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): You may get some criticism on your 
appearance today. Listen to it, for Gods sake!
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Someone has a secret to share, and it will 
change your life for the worse. Don't talk to anyone, and if you see someone 
coming towards you, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): As the Moon swings into Jupiter this 
week, your love life will worsen. If thats possible.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): Your sign is known for its intensity and 
passion. But sitting in front of your laptop watching all five Star Wars movies 
in a row and talking about Leia and Luke like theyre your best friends is 
too much.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): Dont leave your room today. Wait, 
you already did? Oh... Im sorry.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): This week is full of unlucky 
things for you. Your roommate will give you syphilis, all your professors will 
grow to despise you, and because of you a terrible plague will descend on 
campus. I recommend transferring.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Stay far away from all purple 
iguanas this week. Dont say I didnt warn you.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): You know that stash of money you 
keep in your desk under the pictures of your cousins? Someone stole it this 
morning.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): This week you will finally meet your one 
true love. If he leaves you, you may as well never date again. Good luck.

Comickaze
Know Your Publishers! (Part 1)
My dear prospective comic readers. Trying to sort through all the 
comics available is a daunting task, especially considering all the 
crap that permeates the market. One good method for categoriz
ing comics at a glance is to know your publishers. This is by no 
means a complete list, but a good sampling nonetheless.
Fantagraphics
The infamous comics critics Gary Groth and Kim Thompson start
ed Fantagraphics in 1976 as a kind of response to challenges of, 
if youre so smart, then why dont you make your own 
comics? And so they have made comics. Wonderful comics. Based 
in Seattle, Fantagraphics has simultaneously tapped new talent 
such as The Hernandez Brothers (Love and Rockets), Chris Ware 
(ACME Cartooning Company), and Daniel Clowes (Eightball) as 
well as republished Golden and Silver age comics. Better yet, 
Fantagraphics brought underground comix, such as R. Crumbs 
books, to national distribution. Anything from Fantagraphics is 
a good read, and they regularly repubish their comics cheaply 
so as to avoid the collector mentality that pervades so many 
publishers who are more interested in the bottom line than the 
actual comics they produce.
Oni Press
Oni Presss philosophy is a lot less high brow and artistic than 
Fantagraphics, but they still have their own flair. Theyre a small 
company that produces a mix of action and cartoon books, but in 
deference to larger comic publishers, Oni Press makes publish
ing comics their sole business. Big corporate publishers gener
ally publish comics as one step in a business model thats more 
concerned with pushing comic-related products and parapherna
lia (Ill expand more on this later). As a consequence, Oni Press 
tends to carry smarter and more personal titles more often than 
titles that simply sell. The result is a freer environment where 
new stories have emerged that break out of the mold into which 
so many other comics fall without becoming too bizarrely heady. 
Oni Press is my personal favorite publisher.
Archie Comics
Archie Comics publishes Archie, Jughead, and Betty & Veronica. I 
like Archie a lot.
DC Comics
DC Comics is a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment, which in 
turn is part of the Time Warner media conglomerate. The point 
is that DC Comics is not a publisher first, theyre a corpora
tion with investors who demand profits and results. The effect is 
a double-edged sword. On one hand they have the resources to 
produce comics very easily, and pay artists a lot to produce qual
ity work; but the trade-off is a lack of originality and personal ex
perimentation if it rubs the profit-motive the wrong way. In short, 
theyre pretty but bland. DC does, however, divide itself into sepa
rate studios, which have each have a different flavor. The DC 
Comics line proper is the collection of their classic superheroes: 
Batman, Superman, JLA, etc. Wildstorm represents an alternate 
space of superheroes, most of whom were bought from Image
Comics. Wildstorm comics usually project darker, more cyni
cal stories. Finally, Vertigo is their playground for independent 
artists. In the 80s, Vertigo turned out some amazingly original 
works, like Niel Gaimans Sandman, but more recently Vertigo 
comics have become stale under Vertigos own traditions.
Marvel Comics
Marvel is not a comics company. Marvel is a licensing company 
that makes millions of dollars hand-over-fist licensing the use of 
their trademarked properties. The comic Spiderman is not their 
product, but rather the name Spiderman is. The only reason Mar
vel publishes comics is to maintain the economic value of their 
properties. By publishing Spiderman and X-Men now they main
tain their ability in the future to sell the names for use in video 
games, movies, toys, graphic novels, etc. Ever since Stan Lee left 
the company (after having created and popularized virtually all 
their properties), the companys only concern has been to milk 
as much money from the trademarks as possible. The worst ex
ample of this has been the Ultimate line of comics, in which they 
retell superhero stories from the beginning, but updated for a 
more modern context. The effect is a new low in inept writing, 
fan wankery, and commercial trendification. Marvel was the 
first publisher I read from, and as a child I enjoyed their child
ish product. But now Im an adult, and there comes a time to put 
away childish things.
Slave Labor Graphics
Slave Labor Graphics should be renamed The Official Offices of 
Emulating Jhonen Vasquez. Vasquezs awesome, quintessential, 
dark, goth comic, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, was an original 
work of comic brilliance, but Slave Labor has since made an entire 
business out of peddling substandard crap that seeks to remake 
the bygone comic with repeated failure. They have a very specific 
market, and that market is dejected teenagers. Stick to JVs stuff, 
because its witty and great. Then move on.
Tokyopop
I wont beat around the bush. Tokyopop is really, really bad. They 
republish substandard crap from Japanese fan magazines, all of 
which are unoriginal addendums to more popular anime coun
terparts. They all have the same characters making the same ex
pressions in the same style. Im not even trying to be insulting; 
Im just stating facts. The companies that produce the original 
materials overseas produce them in bulk from the same mold 
with employee artists at giant media zaibatsus. The only good 
comics from Japan are either translated by Studio Proteus (ex: 
Akira, Ghost in the Shell), or independent works by Astroboy cre
ator Osamu Tezuka (his newest book, Buddha, is beautiful).
Next week: Dark Horse, Antarctic Press, Image Comics, and a 
whole bunch more!
