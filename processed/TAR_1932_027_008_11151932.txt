A prominent figure in the English musical world, Dr. Feliowes was formerly director of the choir of St. Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle. I-Ie Is the recipient of the degrees of bachelor of music and doctor of music from Oxford University and Dublin University, respectively.
He is largely responsible for the recent revival of interest in the Madrigal in England, Germany, and America. He has devoted a great part of his life to a study of the early song-forms, both religious, and secular, that were common in later medieval England. Through his constant work and extensive researches, he has become the foremost living authority on the Elizabethan and Jacobean epochs of English history.Speaking of one of Dr. Feliowes lectures, a critic has said that the numerous facts he presents, far frombeing' academic or abstruse, contain much of interest and even of fascination. The material that Dr. Feliowes has collected about merrie olde England appeals not only to the scholar and musician, but to any one who is at all interested in England and her traditions.Dr." Feliowes spoke at. Carnegie in 1927 under the sponsorship of a Carnegie organization.The present lecture is to be illustrated either by the Carnegie Madrigal Choir, or by records that have been made under his personal direction by theChoir of St. Georges Chapel and the wellknown English singers.Tickets may be secured from any of the following: Dorothy .T.Morse 33, Vivian O.

After a delay of several days, 
caused by the lack of necessary material, from the downtown or
ganization, the annual Welfare Drive, has begun 011 the Carnegie campus, and will last until November 23. The local campaign, which is directed, by Student Council, is part of the national move-: ment to obtain relief for unemployment and to aid the seventyodd social agencies benefiting from the Welfare Fund. Although 110 quota has been set this year for the local drive, the committee in charge hopes that a contribution of one dollar from each student will be realized.As Inaugurated last year, the Welfare Fund Drive at Carnegie will replace the usual Y. M. C. A. drive, and contributions of one and three dollars will be receipted by membership cards to the Y. M. C. A. A one dollar membership will entitle the owner to social privileges in the downtown Y in Pittsburgh, and111 the case of out-of-town studentsto privileges in their local chapter. A three dollar contribution to the Fund will entitle the donator to a regular six dollar membership in any 
regular Y. M. C. A. chapter. The Carnegie "Y plans its budget entirely from the proceeds of the National Welfare Fund and it is 'with this income that the Y" spono* sors such campus services as Freshman Week activities.Carnegie occupies an Interesting position in the National Drive inasmuch as a former Carnegie student, Catherine Eisaman 23, Pitts
burgh free-lance artist and illustrator, has had one of her posters, a picture of a ten-year-old boy, done in water colors, accepted for nation-wide, use In the. National 
Welfare Drive.The budget to be pledged this year in the Allegheny County Welfare Fund campaign is ?2,480,- 159.98. Of this amount,' only 3.5 per cent will be spent for campaign expenses. The ofilcial apportionment of the budget will be:12.1 per cent for Emergency As
sociation, covering essentially the cost of operation of the association, supplies for the Thrift Gar(Continued on Page Four.)

SPECTATORS WHO WENT TO THE XAVIER CONTEST in Cincin
nati on Saturday with the Idea of seeing a football game were treated 
to a spectacle seldom seen on a college gridiron. It was a contest 
between the referee and the Tartan backs. The idea was to see who 
could gain the most ground. First George Kave! would take the ball 
and go up the field for nine yards; then the referee would pick it up and walk down the field fifteen yards. After which, tlie process was repeated. For a little while It looked bad for the Skibos, but despite tho fact that the officials carried the ball more times than did the Tartans our lads would not be disheartened so they came off the field with a 15-0 victory.Carnegies hopes for the Pitt game received a severe jolt when Bill Splsak was forced to leave the game because of a dislocated elbow. It Is doubtful If Spisak will bo In the lineup for several weeks. Tom Coulter, track captain and one of the schools best athletes, ask him, played In his first varsity football game and did right well. He scored the Skibos second touchdown on an end run.
ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON, WHEN THE TARTAN FOOTBALL TEAM goes over to the Stadium to attempt to conquer the undefeated Panther eleven it will make the eighteenth time that teams of the two schools have met, and the Tartans will he out to score their fifth victory over their greatest rival. Most football fans would say that that possibility of such a victory 1O about equal to Mr. Hoovers chance of being the new Secretary of State, for figures show that Jock Sutherlands team should win by a margin of forty-one to fifty-four points. Tho well known comparative scores seem to indicate just such a thing. That is, Notre Dame defeated the Plaid by forty-two points, and Pitt took tho Irish by twelve points which gives Pitt a fifty-four point advantage. Also, Pitt defeated West Virginia 42-0; West Virginia lost to Temple 14-13; Temple tied Carnegie 7-7; all of which leaves Pitt with a forty-one point advantage from that set of figures. Yet comparative scores mean little in football. Each year during the course of a season there are so many upsets and so many times that a team will play unbeatable football one week only to lose to a mediocre opponent tho next week, that statisticians have found little success in predicting the outcomes of gridiron classics. This is particularly true in games involving traditional rivals. For instance, Dartmouth has succeeded in defeating Yale but once in their entire gridiron history and many times the Big Green team has been the favorite. Cornell has liad only a slightly better record against its Thanksgiving Day foe, tho University of Pennsylvania. And right here in Pittsburgh who would have over predicted the victories of the Tartans in 23 and 24? There are many people who favor Pitt to win, hut one will have a hard time finding many who are willing to put up very great odds against tho Skibos.
THE FIRST TARTAN VICTORY OVER ITS CITY RIVAL was back In 1923 when the two teams met after a three-year break in the schedule. It was on this afternoon that Jimmy Robertson wrote his name on the scroll as one of Carnegies greatest sports heroes by scoring the touchdown that beat the Panthers 7-2. The play which won the game started as an ordinary end run with Jimmy carrying the ball, but when ho saw several opponents racing in toward him he stopped, reversed his field, and raced around the opposite end for the lone tally of the game. Of almost equal fame was the run of Dike Beedes in the 
game the following year. In this contest, Beede, on a spinner, raced through the Panthers line and on down the field for 60 yards where he was brought down on the two-yard line. On the next play a line plunge netted the touchdown which won the game 6-0. The next victory was In 1926 when Harpster, Letzeler, Mefort, and Donahue were making names for themselves In the sport world. Bill Donahue and Cy Mefort each reeled off long runs to score In a game in which the Panthers were completely outclassed. Only penalties and bad breaks kept the 14-0 score from mounting higher. The fall of 1928 found the 
Tartans with one of the strongest teams in the history of the school, and they entered the Pitt game as the favorite. But It was a bad day for football. Rain fell throughout the contest and the field was wet and slippery. Towards the end of the second quarter the Plaid eleven penetrated deeply Into Pitt territory and it looked like there would surely be a touchdown. But fate wan with Pitt, for Just then the gun sounded ending the half. Harpsters pnsses found their mark In the third quarter and before the Panthers knew what was happening 
the pigskin was on the eight-yard line. On fourth down with a yard to go Harpster sneaked through center for a touchdown. Tho game ended 6-0. The Pitt boys were out In front In 1929 by a 34-13 score, With a blocked kick, a fumble, and an intercepted pass leading to Panther scores early In the game the Skibos Just couldnt overtake them.It was a strange piece of luck that won the game for Jock Sutherland's proteges In 1930. Tho fact of the matter Is Pitt scored seven points without making a touchdown. A pass early In the half gave our opponents tho ball within our ton-yard line. On fourth down there was 11II two yards to go to tho last mark, so Franklin Hood was given the ball and ho started for tho center of tho line. To the officials It looked as If Hood oronsod tho mark; niaybo ho did but he didn't have tho ball. Big John Karols who was at the bottom of tho pile had the ball safely under him on tho one-yard lino whoro Hood had fumbled It, but no amount of pleading or arguing could make tho offlolals chango tholr decision. In tho socond half tho Tartans carried the ball all over tho field but couldn't score until late In the last suarter. Tho kick for extra point was blooked so t|io gamo was lost 7-6. Last yoar the supposedly weak Skibos throw an awful scare Into Captain Eddie Baker and his great team. Two long passes netted the Blue and Gold two touchdowns which wore Juat one more than the Stoffonltes could garner. That great Pitt line which was so highly touted was outplayed in every department of the gamo that afternoon. Carnegie gained fifteen first downs to their opponents' seven and our neighbors were mighty glad to have tho game end when It did.
A VICTORY THIS YEAR WOULD BE VERY SWEET for most of tho seniors who so far as undergraduates have been unable to celebrate a win over our traditional rival. It would be loads of fun to be able, just once, to have the upper hand over the students on the other side of the hill. Then, too, when we become old alumni we could brag about how when we were in college our team had downed the Panthers. But why not? Each day my enthusiasm and confidence takes a notch upward so by Friday night I will be at a point where I will 
think Pitt is in for an awful trimming; but I hope my enthusiasm doesnt land me down in the Oakland police station as it almost did last year and two years ago, with quite a few other boys. Pitt luis had its holiday; Duquesne lias had theirs; so Monday I am intending to stay home and sleep. Who knows but what Saturdays contest may produce another Robertson, or Donalioe, or Beede. Stranger things have happened.____________________________________________

As Penalties Mar 
Xavier Contest
The old Tartan bandwagon was a bit hesitant in playing the victory march in their Xavier tune-up but when the Cincinnati concert 
finally ended tlie Clansmen carried away with them a 15 to 0 advantage. At no time, before the 10,000 shivering spectators, did the Skibos seem to take the game seriously or get up enough steam to carve out a large score. Carnegie was intent on winning only and once their advantage was established, were content to coast-in.Penalties Slow Up GamePenalties which occurred with a 
high school consistency through
out the first half kept the Tartans from endangering the Musketeer 
goal. Whether poor officiating or poor playing was to blame, the 
fact remains that Carnegie was set back four times in their first six plays and so frequently thereafter that the contest was slowed down to a walk.All of Carnegies first period excursions into Xavier territory 
were nullified through these penalties. And once in this quarter when the Ohioans recovered a Tartan fumble deep in pay-off land the visitors were placed momentarily in danger but quickly bore down and took the ball away from Xaxier. Soon after the second stanza started Kavel broke loose on one of his typical sojourns and cruised 33 yards to the Xaxier 13. But here the Musketeer's fine defensive qualities came into play and Carnegie was forced to surrender the ball on downs.On the very next play the whole Tartan line in general and Stewart in particular simply smothered 
Brannons attempted punt and Burzio tossed the kicker for a Bafety after the latter had recovered bis blocked boot. The Tartans seemed to come to life once the ice had been broken and after receiving Xavier's kick, promptly 
started for another score. Kavel made eight through the line and McCurdy replaced Dueger at quarter. The new field general tossed 
one incomplete pass and then whipped a beauty to Spisak who gathered the oval in on the 37, and dashed over for tlie first touchdown. Stewart's attempt was good and tho period ended soon after.Spisak InjuredThe second half brought both sorrow and joy to Carnegie followers, shortly after play was reimmed, little Bill Spisak who lias won his way to a varsity halfback berth in his first year, suffered a very bad dislocated elbow and may 
bo unable to play In the romalning gamos this season. Bill's absence was partially offset by Tom Coulter who replaced him and proc.eodod to carry on in great style. A pass, McCurdy to Stewart, had 
placed tho ball d'oop in Cincy territory and Coulter in his first try at collogo football, ripped off fivo yards and planted the pigskin on 
tho Xavier three. Sayles luggod I ho oval up to tho ono-ynrd lino and Coulter, on tho play, swept around end and scorod standing up. Tho try for point was wldo and with this gesture tho scoring for I ho day ended.

Cats Favored Heavily As 
19th Battle For City 
Laurels Nears
As the current football season 
moves into the twilight stage there 
comes to the Western Pennsylva
nia sport fans the high spot of the 
gridiron yearthe Carnegie-Pitt 
classic. And with it comes one of 
the greatest opportunities for na
tional prominence, local redemp
tion and above ail, victory over her 
bitterest rival, ever to knock at 
Carnegie athletic portals. Not 
since the fall of 2G when that im
mortal little band of red-jerseyed 
crusaders stacked its courage and ability against the world and Notre Dame and raised Carnegie to the place she now holds in collegiate football, has a Tartan team had the chance, in one fell swoop to not only regain all its lost prestige, but to add much more.
Pitt Heavy Favorite
Carnegies chances of beating Pitt, especially since the Panthers are headed toward a National Championship and simply cannot afford to lose, appear rather small. On a basis of comparative scores, using the Notre Dame game as an example, Pitt is 54 points better than the Plaid. Also, Pitt' is famed as a November team and, this, coupled with the fact that she lias more capable reserves, will certainly not boost Carnegies stock.
However, there remains lurking in the minds of Skibo students and alumni the conviction that the Tartans have much better material and are capable of much better teamplay than their previous games would indicate, and it will be only after a decisive Pitt victory has been entered in the records that adherents of the Plaid will admit the wide difference now prevailing between the two teams.Plaid Slow In DevelopingThe present Carnegie aggregation has been slow in rounding into shape and consequently has not giv.en any convincing performances. And even should it reach its peak Saturday, time alone will tell if that "peak is sufficient to 
cage the wily Panther. In the meanwhile Pitt and Duquesne by virtue of their respective victories over Notre Dame and W. & J., continue to crow over the Tartans past record and future chances.And so, in view of the overwhelming odds which favor Pitt Saturday, one might well argue that the coming contest offers little opportunity to Carnegie. This would be quite true if it were just an ordinary game. But Pitt-Carnegie games are not ordinary, as past performances show. Therefore this opportunity idea is based on two great possibilities; first that Carnegie will come to its own .and play the type of game against Pitt that its followers think it can, and second, that the team will regain in some part at loast, tho courage and spirit which saturated last years combine and which will bo so necessary against the Panthers.Admitting that it is not good football to base hopes upon conditions so unstable as those above, nevertheless it is the attitude taken by students as far back as colloges have had football teams. Hope springs eternal in the breasts of undergraduates on the 
eve of "the game and so it is now at Carnegie, with the Tartans and Pitt awaiting their impending fray.First Game In 1906
Grid relations with the Plaids arch-rival began back in 1906 and, of the nine games played up to 1917, Carnegie always had to be content with the losers share. However, the Tartan fighting spirit so prevalent in 1926 and last year also played an important role throughout those early days. In 1916 a determined Tartan team laced the greatest Pitt machine in history and the latter was grateful for the meager 14-6 victory which it finally dragged home. And the following year when Phil Marshal 
broke through the Pitt line and raced 98 yards for a Skibo score, Carnegie enthusiasm reached a new high. Pitt eventually won 17-7 but as a result of the riot which followed the game it was three years until grid relations between the two schools could be safely resumed.Difficulties were patched up by 1923, Pop Warners last at Pitt, and it was in that season that Carnegie, under the leadership of tlie famous Jimmy Robertson, scored her first victory over tlie Panthers. Robertsons beautiful 20-yard run in that game, and Dike Beedes 60-yard sprint to a 6-0 victory the following year are still the main topics of conversation at Carnegie home-coming affairs. 
Pitt won, 12-0, tlie nekt year but Donalioe, Yoder ana Co. were too much for the Gold Cats in 1926. Nineteen twenty-seven and 29 are the real headaches for Tartan folEDGEWORTH SMOKING TOBACCO

RecalledIn 1930 Pitt  upset the Tartans 7-6 and Skibo followers will be long in forgetting the spectacle of a favored Carnegie team going down to defeat at the hands of Pitt. Last year an overwhelmingly favorite Panther team was 
forced to the limit to extract a 14-6 victory over one of the most 
courageous groups of men ever to represent Carnegie, in any form of athletics. With little lo recommend it from a mechanical standpoint, that great eleven outfought 
Pitt from whistle to whistle and stunned the tolerant spectators at
one stage by driving 70 yards on straight football through what was supposed to be the greatest line in the country.
Since becoming a major school .in football circles, Carnegie has defeated Pitt four times while losing five. Previous to that time Pitt held nine victories over the Plaid. Never in the history of CarnegiePitt encounters has a tie game been played.

Well I see we are in for a home
coming again this year. You dont 
know who are coming home? 
Surely it isnt possible that you 
hadnt thought of the alumni and 
their various clubs and clans. 
Yes, they are coming home to their 
alma mater for the annual house 
warming, story swapping, sight seeing, get together. Sorta prodigal son movement, tor some of them I am sure, for if they are on a par with other organizations, 
they have members who have not been back to the campus since hector was a pup. Gee, it must be fine to be old enough to belong to 
such a group. Wonder what you do to join? Suppose Ill have to wait until I get green with moss before I am eligible to attend one of those shindigs. Anyway, I hope they have a hot time in old Pittsburgh this week. Im with you to a man, alumni.Wonder why we cant have a R. O. T. C. at night? Funny all the fine things take place at the day school. Just the other day 
they elected fair cadet officers to help the robust honest to goodness officers do their duty. Just take a look at the picture in last weeks Tartan, page four if you please. 
Spotted in the center is a picture worth framing. Who wouldn't obey a command from such a corps of Atten-shun, eyes right, forward-go officers. My -hats off to them, and I hope we get such a cadre at night.At last we have bats in the Bellfry at Carnegie. The birds are building their nests in our noble piles and this in itself is a sign of old age. I was really surprised to find that we had the birds flying around in our classes. They were right on time toofor they came out during roll call and returned to their nests at the termination of the session which was about 10:00 p. m. And, not to be outdone by the night students, they were the birds of the night variety, bats if you please, with their long webshaped claws, scooping hither and yon. Better start a class in zoology, as we have the subjects right in our midst.I was amused the other evening 
to hear a heated discussion between two night art students and a lal*ge group of students from the other two night colleges. All sorts 
of reasons were advanced why the little pieces of cardboard known as tickets should be given out. The art students seemed to be on the winning end of the discussion especially so because they hadn't a>1y tickets to give out much to the disappointment of the would-be art students from the other colleges. 
It seems that everybody wants to go to the dances and as Thistle Hall can accommodate only so many the only other thing to do would be to enlarge the dance floor. Make it sorta elastic so that it could be extended and contracted to accommodate the size of the parties in attendance. Now thats

Yes, I have a number of ideas, but I am going to hold them in reserve and spring them from time to time.Did you notice, due apologies to the other columnist, that I am sorta being panned from time to time by that contemporary. Now, this is a sign that you are either very good, or very bad. At all events you are being read and after all that is a good sign. Nobody reads anything which is not printed .but to be read by the students in your group shows that you are worth something. I have even heard myself being quoted

Art Impressions 
Of An Engineer
By stealing a march on one of the science departments to the extent of doing three hours homework in one (oh yeah!) one of the engineers managed to visit the art show at the Carnegie Institute. His reactions were somewhat as follows:
Only had time to visit the second floor galleries. Pretty good show. The modernists had the first room to themselves, practically. One painting of a wrestling match made the old joints ache. Such a tangle. The second room appealed more to a mere engineer. The third room was largely overlooked because I was wondering why the girl in the green dress looked so surprised. The artist was clever anyway. The fourth 
room holds some interest for the civils, theres a picture of a cement mixer. The last group was made 
up of water colors, black and white work, art objects, and so forth. All very pleasing, but I am still trying to figure out numbers 192 and 202. Himmel! but theyre complicated. Funny too, if you want to admit youre not among 
the cogniscents. Maybe Ill get up to the third floor sometime and finish my impressions. See you again.With these pointed (?) remarks, the man who was intensely busy doing nothing left the scribe in a deep, heavy fog.

THE SURROUNDING 
WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
A week ago today the United 
States witnessed a political up
heaval such as it has not seen in 
its history. Franklin D. Roose
velt, the Democratic candidate, 
was swept into office by an un
precedented vote. Herbert Hoover 
likewise received the greatest de
feat ever experienced by any 
major candidate. Mr. Hoover conceded the election to Mr. Roosevelt during election night before 
the returns were complete.Roosevelt carried many other 
Democrats into office and defeated a number of Republican leaderss who were perennial members of Congress, such as Senator James E. Watson, George H. Moses, Reed Smoot and many others.This unanticipated Democratic sweep may have been due the present economic maladjustment, which has 'affected almost every home in America, or the extremely low prices of wheat, corn and other basic commodities or Prohibition, which the Democrats promised to repeal outright, or finally the general condition of 
unrest which prevailed before the election which led to the desire for change.
Italy did npt have an election. They have Mussolini instead, but its people are all excited anyhow. II Duce has been receiving much applause from his countrymen by proclaming in loud and well-chosen words that the United States should be lenient in the payment of the war debts. Speaking before 
more than half a million Italian citizens, a short while ago, he asked them if they were going to 
alloAV the ship of Debts and Repa* 
rations, which is now safely in the Harbor of Lousanne, to be pushed out into open sea again by the 
Americans. He received a resounding "No" for an answer. Mussolini has come forward and stated frankly, so frankly that it really hurts, the opinion of other Euro
pean countries. He does not even wish to bargain or barter, but lie does want his "No to be clear. The present situation indicates that all Europe is trying to make the United States pay for her wars. Was it not enough that 
American blood was shed on European soil?After due consideration, the Canadian, Government has issued a 
statement saying that the present high tariff rates are not a retaliation caused by the Smoot-Hawley tariff but a protection to the British Empire. If they hurt the 
United States it is not intentional and is incidental. With all of the 
nations of the world trying to make up the United States Governments 
mind about its policy on tariff and reparations, the job of the next President is not going to be so easy in regards to this debatable question of tariff policy.Slavery is not extinct! In Cen
tral Asia the wild Tukoman raiders are still sweeping down on the Russo-Afghan frontier villages, 
capturing the inhabitants and carrying them off to slave markets. The captured victims are then taken to Samarkand where they 
are sold during fairs, The women usually bring a higher, price than the men when placed on the auction block. This slave trading is not illicit not even is it done in private. It is an institution in Turk
estan as it once was in this counttry.

Dance to be held November 25 in the mens gymnasium marks the opening of the social season sponsored by the Night Student Council. Coming as it does in the midst of the Thanksgiving festive season, this function will be a gala affair. Decorations and trimmings in keeping with the day will make 
the dance one that will be remembered for a long time.Plans are being formulated now for the affair which portend a successful party. Nothing is being left undone to make the frolic a big affair for the night students. Music, refreshments, decorations, all will be available for the dancers.This dance will furnish the first opportunity for the students of all three night colleges, Arts, Industries, and Engineering, to become acquainted. Each of these schools 
hold functions at various times at which students of that particular college only attend. - The functions sponsored by the Night Student Council are the only affairs on the night campus which students from all the colleges attend.Tickets are now being distributed to various salesmen and are available to all members of the student body, both night and day. The assessment will be one dollar a couple and at this cost, a large turnout of the students is expected. Get your tickets early and then tell the girl friend about the good time which awaits her on Friday evening, November 25. Dont allow anything to keep you away.

tions; celotex for insulation, and enameled shingles of various colors for outside ornamentation. The houses will include all modern conveniences including electric refrigeration and heating plant. The construction is said to bo fireproof, lightning proof, vermin proof and to have considerable permanency because of its peculiar type of construction.Considerable opposition has been encountered in the development of this type of home building. One reaso11 advanced is the cost of construction, and while the present cost is more than the average man can afford the possibilities are that with large production the cost can be materially reduced Chance For New Industry
The new type of construction offers plenty of opportunity to architects and building and construction engineers to develop their ingenuity so as to make the homes desired both from an architectural 
and structural standpoint. They can easily compete with the homes of frame, brick and stone. An added feature would be the possibility of a community of fireproof homes.
On the whole this new type of construction gives promise of a rise of a new industry; just the thing we need to absorb the unemployed masses. Such an industry 
would make possible communities of decently constructed homes with all modern conveniences to take the place of the old, dilapidated 
structures one sees in every. city of any size. It offers opportunity to students in the courses of study given at Carnegie and Pittsburgh should be in a position to take the lead with all the advantages a steel center commands. Pre-fabricated houses, in spite of opposition, will come sooner or later and they will result in a community of better built homes.

The Fortunate Should Help The Unfortunate
Have you ever walked clown to the Baltimore and Ohio 
railroad station at SmithfielcT aind -Water streets and observed 
the haggard men lying on the cold cobble stones like bundles of 
rags, uninterested in life, weak from lack of food and shelter, 
and with minds hopelessly dull from repeated obsession and 
despair? Have you ever wandered through the slums of Pitts
burgh, say along Penn or Liberty avenues in the Strip District, 
or in Soho, and observed the. sunken eyes of bedraggled children 
staring at you\? Or have you ever s?at down in a big comfort
able chair in a cozy living rbom and read about the suffering 
families who have been forced to move out into the cold with
out food.because of their inability to pay rent? If you havent 
done any of these things, you may do them any day in the 
week. It would be difficult to picture yourself living under 
such deplorable conditions, would it not?
There are sojne seventy-five social agencies in the Pitts
burgh district who for the past several years have been valiant
ly giving food,'shelter, and clothing to needy people, as well as 
providing for free medical aid and the caring of neglected chil
dren. It is unfortunate that our economic and social systems 
allow such conditions to exist. But they do exist, and we must 
turn to private organizations supported by private contribu
tions and public funds to carry on relief work.
For nearly a week the Welfare Drive1 has been going on 
among the students and faculty to secure funds to support these 
organizations for the coming year. Is it not appropriate that 
the students should deprive themselves of an evenings pleasure 
and give something to help feed, clothe, and shelter the unfor
tunates? It would not be a very great sacrifice and it would do 
so much good.
Welcome, Grads:
Class reunions, luncheons. entertainments, receptions, 
smokers, dances, a Little Theater production, a football game, 
and other events will welcome the alumni next week-end during 
the annual home-coming ceremonies on the campus. The Ad
ministration, Alumni Association, Student Council, and various 
social fraternities are planning many events. An lionest-togoodncss bonfire and pep rally sponsored by Student Council 
next Friday evening, the first this year, offers a splendid oppor
tunity for alumni and undergraduates to unite once again in 
spirited revelry.
The Campus Invasion Agreement:
TPho University of Pittsburgh's student council has taken a 
'firm stand on tlio recent invasion of the Carnegie campus by 
Pitt students. Last week the council passed a resolution up
holding an agreement between the student councils of Pitt and 
Carnegie which pledges, in part, that members oil their respec
tive student bodies will not visit each others campus to inter
fere with athletic signs, paint letters, create disturbances, or 
damage property.
At a meeting of the Pitt council last week it was admitted 
that the Pitt students had violated the agreement in their en
thusiasm over the Pitt victory in the Pitt-Notre Dame game 
and that future infractions would he severely dealt with by the 
Dean of Men and Dean of Women. The willingness of the Pitt 
student governing group to co-operate with the Carnegie stu
dent council is highly commendable. Such action will do much 
to further the existing friendly relations between the two in
stitutions.
The agreement between the councils reads: The Student 
Councils at Carnegie Institute of Technology and at University 
of Pittsburgh have mutually pledged that the members of their 
respective student bodies will not visit each others campus to 
interfere with athletic signs, paint letters, create disturbances, 
or damage property.
The Councils, being opposed to these inter-campus tres
passes, have gone further. They have agreed to pay for any 
damage done by their students, in this connection. Any stu
dent, therefore, who commits an act of the above description, 
is not .only disloyal to the cause of good student government at 
his college, but is involving his Student. Council in a debt of 
honor.
The Student Councils will recommend to their respective 
faculty discipline committees the expulsion of any student 
found guilty of violating the spirit or the letter of this mutual 
agreement.
"'^Nuw.that this announcement has been made, it is believed 
that no further action will be necessary.
The Carnegie council should feel confident that the stu
dents will co-operate with them in maintaining this agreement.

What Next?
It is interesting to learn that now that beer and light wines 
will soon be legalized, one of the correspondents for the Scripps 
IToAvard newspaper chain is advocating the importation of 
wiiies as payment for war debts. What has happened to all the 
ballyhoo about beer bringing back prosperity through the con
sumption of the farmers grain and by putting men to work in 
the breweries or the talk about the tax revenue to balance the 
budget? It goes to show that every man may have his own 
theory.
Arthur Brisbane, Hearst columnist, comments: It is pa
thetic that the richest nation-in the world should rely for the 
solution of its money problem on a glass of beer and the amount 
that the drinker can be taxed.
The wse man who knows what it is to swim in rough 
water, and intends to succeed in spite of depression will let 
somebody else have the beer.
Beer anakes-you sleepy, contented with yourself and the 
world. It is an excellent thing ior the hard-working laborer, a 
bad thing for the man who wants to use his brain. Nothing is 
more, dangerous-than.a state ofcontentment.

Policemen of the future will be 
intellectual chaps. The Los Angeles Junior College has instituted 
a new course for the purpose of training men and women for federal, state, and county detective positions. With the increase in crime and the advent of the shrewder type of criminal, there is an evident need for college-train
ed men to meet the situation.
ITS ALL OVER NOW
Sorority rushing season came to an end with the usual 4:30 demonstration in the lower corridor of the Arts building last Wednesday. Manya tear of joy was shed and many a sisterly hug was exchanged. Everyone was quite pleased with the results and the building rocked with girlish glee. The 
overlapping of 
bids was so slight this year that each sorority got p r a c t ically everyone they wanted and now all that remains is pledgeship.
HERE AND THERE
It has been rumored about the campus' that Ira Kuhn has recently acquired an interest in U. S. Steel, preferred no doubt.
That little fur hat that Becky Webb wore to the Military Ball (if you didnt see it you read about it in the paper) was the result of a hair cut that failed to please.
A lot of us go moaning around about having our names spelled wrong in the paper but Wilfred Uffelman'got the worst deal of the year when his name came out as Winifred.
The attendance at the tea dances continues to be swelled by the local high school lassies.
The Night Arts dance attracted a number of day students including Chuck Pepine,- Paul Phenegar, Fred Ford, and Charles Applegate.
The latest suggestion for reducing activities expenses is to provide each vest-heavy celeb with a skeleton key.
Bob Eberle continues to be chief fraternity critic in Mr. Carrols French class, and would you believe it, he refers the little girls to teacher for verification.
Ex-Kernal Will Holloway had a taste of actual fire (on the front) last week.
Will apprehended a burglar in Jack Horning's house Wednesday evening who instructed our dashing Will (at the point of a gun) to remain rigid and everything would be lulu. The looting gentleman, stepping to the phone to do a bit of clipping, tripped, and fell, accidentally discharging his gat. The bullet lodged in the floor in the near vicinity of Wills canal boats. We dont know what Will did, but we dp know the thug
scrammed pronto. Yes, girls, thats why he was , so calm at the Military Ball. Its a tough life these army men lead.

Duke supporters ran off with the Thistle Hall sign last week.

THE MILITARY BALL
Always the most colorful dance of the year, the Military Ball of this season went its predecessors one better. Thistle Hall, decorated for the first time since its opening, was barely recognizable under the maze of flags that occupied every nook and cranny. Every available uniform was called into play, officers cadet officers, humble privates, the boys from Pitt, and a sprinkling of mere civilians gave the affair a truly military air.
The climax of the evenings activities came when the newly chosen honorary officers marched in with the corresponding cadet officers under an arch of shining sabers. Colonel McClean presented the gals with their commissions. Then came the Scabbard and Blade call by ex-Colonel Holloway, now Lieutenant.
Bill Councill was observed in his customary roll of Adjutant to the Commander assisting, of course, Colonel Ruth Nye. The rem a i n d e r of 
the regiment 
lined up as follows: Major Becky Linn and Captain ' Two BricksRobinson, Ma
jor Gloria Kloos and civilian Jimmy Stahl, Captain Kitty Lou Jessop and Captain Larry Dickson, Captain Ann Warden and civilian Harry Madsen, Captain Kay Winslow and ex-Captain Sumner Dana, Captain Marion McNary and civi-i lian Jimmy Traa, Captain Jean Douglas and Sergeant Cliff Carr, and Captain Evelyn Gamble with civilian Logan Webster.Until next year
DRAMA REVIEW
BY WARD WARREN
We put on our best suitthe dark blue one you liked so much and went to the Little Theater last Friday to see Ibsens Pillars of Society.
In imitation of Scribeswellmade play, the plot is quite intricate and melodramatic: and with few exceptions each character is intimately concerned in its development.
The direction of the play is to be commended for a natural and, in most cases, convincing performance. Considered as a whole, we thought that Pillars was very well done. There was a tone of sincerity to the entire production that made it an enjoyable even
ings entertainment. With an eye toward presenting some reactions gotten from North of the curtain line, wed like to speak of the individual performances.
Thomas Gorman, as Karsten Berniclc, gave us a rather clear idea of the conniving ship builder who is freed from this unhappy state through the combined force of a fear generated by the narrowly averted loss of his son, and the spiritual proddings of his former 
fiancee. Suzanne Bennett, playing Mrs. Berniclc, provided the necessary colorless background designed 
to contrast with the egotistical importance of her husband. In a footnote we might add that' Miss Bennetts performance seemed a trifle forcedat times.We liked Vernon Crane in his blue sailor suit with the red stars on its collar. He seemed quite 
vivaciously young; yet we believe that lie hurt his performance in the last act when lie is discovered expectantly posed on his toes when 
the curtains which hid him are drawn open. His situation might have seemed more plausible, after the delay in opening the curtains, if he had been found on his knees in the last hasty stages of gathering his belongings. Mary Hamiltons constrained sadness made us afraid wed be caught with tears in our eyes, especially after we
saw some members of the audience dabbing tiny handkerchiefs to their eyes. Hilmar Tonnesen was a perfect picture of a pathetic loafer who seems almost to believe his own excuses; yet he appeared to be entirely on the outside of Robert Gill as he ughed through 11 four acts.

When Miss Sisenwain on occasion uses her upper register, the pitch of lier voice really goes up, thereby weakening lier characterization and somewhat taxing lier auditors.
Its a shame that George McCalmon spoiled an otherwise excellent piece of work by the way in which lie stalked onto and off the stage like a real showboat villain, chin first, with arms and legs flying about like shuttles. Mary Dingfelder, as Dina Dorf, soon won our affection and sympathy. William Beal struggled stubbornly with a part that could have been dull with no effort at all.
Donald Gallagher, John Sollers, and William Bales, three of the pillars who helped Berniclc drain the community, managed to portray distinct individuals. Irene Cowan, Dorothy Neumann, and Elizabeth Levinger provided one of the most amusing scenes in the play as the gossipping town criers. Edward Palkot, as Bernicks confidential clerk, almost seemed to have a knife in his hand when with glowering brows he dis

Syracuse University has found 
the freshman interest-house program a great success. Freshmen interested in literature, science, or philosophy are housed together in 
individual houses. Instructors or graduate students act as leaders and these groups become self-governing, organized units. The plan 
was installed last yearand fewer freshmen failed than ever before.The Bison, undergraduate publication of the University of Buffalo, was severely criticized a year ago when several jokes printed in the magazine' received nation-wide publicity over a radio network. The students activities committee has banned the magazine on grounds of unfavorable publicity.Women of Northwestern University founded a Widows Union, and some of the men found the idea so appealing (or appalling) that they formed a Widowers Association. The organizations are entirely separate, and consist of lieart-siclc souls with lovers out of town. The women wear yellow ribbons around their necks to signify their lack of interest in local men, while the men wear a piece of black ribbon pinned to their vests with a safety pin to indicate their indifference to campus belles.

James V. Sheridan is studying the effect of the dielectric constant 
of the solvent upon the rate of the conversion of ammonium cyauate 
into urea. He hopes to obtain results which will help decide the exact mechanism of this reaction.Jjunes T. Kingsbury is investigating the rate of the reaction between ethyl iodide and sodium 
thiosulpliate in solvents of varying dielectric constants. The results obtained by Mr. Sheridan and 
Mr. Kingsbury will be used to test 
modern theories of reaction rates in solutions.Arthur P. Demarco is conducting experiments on the rate of mutarotation of malic acid' and sodium 
malate. His findings will be used to test the validity of the present theories of acid and base catalysis and should be of great use iu developing a more satisfactory theory of muta-rotation.
Arthur B. Kemper is doing re
search work on the sulphates of tri and tetra-valent titanium ions 
in solution. Little information is available on the behavior of the 
sulphates of titanium and hopes by his work to add something about its behavior and, if possible, 
its molecular structure to the annals of science.

English fl ays

An inimitable columnist of con
temporary journalistic fame pre
sents some of the poetic effects of 
faulty grammar:
Gals who say, I would have went, . 
Horrify the Princeton, gent.
Gals who Say, With he and I, 
Annihilate thp AmlieVst guy.
Gals who say, I would have did, 
Petrify the Harvard kid.
In the same lofty vein may we ask what would gals who say, If Id of luiowed you could * of went. Id of saw that you got. to git to go. do to the Carnegie youth? No doubt they would slay him. There is a possibility that his tremendous interest 'in the sciences or the applied arts would cause him to let pass unnoticed such corrupting sirens. This illiterate speech, however, should command some notice, for any language construction like it is not in any level of good usagea statement not entirely obvious if we may judge from the high frequency of have did, had ought, couldnt help but, cant hardly, and the like, in our immediate vicinity.
What of this faulty usage in speech and writing? It can hardly be attributed to ignorance or il
literacy. Educated people can differentiate between the correct and incorrect. Their use of the incorrect, therefore, must be due to our absence of good habits of language composition. The first step in acquiring power in expression is to learn correctness, and the second is to make that correct use habitual.It is also true that errors in expression may be intentional, may be made in an effort' to escape conventional usage, because oT its possible monotony or triteness. The error is iiot made to supply any deficiency of the language, but rather to be individual, showy, ultra-expressive. Some newspaper coinages are of this . kind combii/e, burgle, suspicioned. Furthermore, paradoxically enough, the purpose of the writer 
or speaker Is not to express an Idea but to obscure it, attention thereby being directed to the phrasing. College undergraduates, for example, use the phrase calce eater with more regard for its possible striking connotations, than for its meaning, however limited in use that may be. All of this intentional violating of aomo standard of propriety in the l'od usage of language is slang.
