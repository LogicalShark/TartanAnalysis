New Six Man Board 
Will Pass Judgement
In order to protect and main
tain the reputation of the frater
nity system, the Council of Fra
ternity Presidents is setting up a 
Court of Justice to enforce CFP 
and CIT rules. The bill, initiated 
by Don Stitt, Delta Upsilon, Dick 
Holl, Delta Tau Delta, Earl Latterman, Beta Sigma Rho, Dick 
Sneeden, Alpha Tau Omega, and 
Dean David will probably be 
passed within the next few weeks.
Infractions of rules by any fra
ternity or fraternity man will be 
handled by the Court of Justice. 
The court will consist of a board 
of six members, three from the 
faculty and three from CFP.
This is not a radically new pol
icy, but it is the first time the 
court system has been set up in 
writing. It is hoped that this will 
aid CFP to become effective in 
intra-fraternity legislation.

Mens Dorm 
Rental Rates 
Increased
Rising Cost of Service 
Necessitates Increase 
In Mens Dorm Rent
Increased mens dormitory ren
tal rates, effective next semester, 
have been announced by the 
Committee on Auxiliary Enter
prises. The increases, ranging 
from $14 to $38, will apply to all 
graduate dorm rentals.
Costs of providing dormitory 
service have been increasing for 
several years, the committee 
states, and increases in rental 
tfates are now inevitable. The new 
rates are, on the average, only 
30 percent higher than pre-war 
the level, whereas most items in 
the cost of living have practically 
doubled.
Here are the new rates, effect
ive next semester: (all rates list
ed are per-man per-year).
Henderson Hall:
Single room, private bath $368
Double room, private bath  $244
Double room, sharing' bath 
with two students 
in next suite $222
Welch Hall:Single room, semi-private bath $256 
Double room, private bath $244 
Double room, sharing bath 
with two students 
in next suite $220
Boss and McGill Halls:
Single room $198
Double suite $186
Double room $176
Scobell Hall:
Single room $1*2
Corner double room $162-
Double room other than corner $138 
Basement corner double room $126 
Basement double room $116
FPHA:Single room $136
Double room $124
These increases represent an in
crease in total income from dor
mitory fees of about 15 percent, 
the amount judged necessary by 
the Controllers office.
Room and breakage deposits 
and activities fees will remain un
changed next year.
Activities omitted from last 
weeks list for activity keys, 
have been released. They are 
as follows: Panhellenic Coun
cil maximum, 5 points ior of
ficers, 3 points for members; 
Chapel Choir, 5 points for of
ficers, 3 points for members; 
Beaux Arts, 3 points for offic

Electronic Thinking Machines 
Subject Of Assembly Address
Electronic Thinking Machines 
will be the subject of the lecture 
to be delivered by Dr. C. C. Hurd, 
director of the applied science de
partment of the IBM corporation, 
at the student assembly on Tues
day, May 2.
Dr. Hurd, an expert in the field 
of high speed computing machines, 
has already gained a reputation as 
an interesting and effective speak
er. His talk on the Carnegie cam
pus will be directed at the laymen 
in the field as well as at the spe

A highly controversial topic in 
scientific circles for quite some 
time, Dr. Hurds subject premises 
to draw a capacity crowd at the 
Carnegie theater in the Fine Arts 
building. The lecture will be 
sponsored by Pi Mu Epsilon, na

Prior to accepting his present 
post, Dr. Hurd received his doc
torate from the University of Illi
nois in 1936 and taught at Iowa 
State College, Michigan State Col

? of the Carnival Queen.
The Carnival committee has se
lected fourteen general topics for 
the parade from which the par
ticipating organizations will draw 
to decide their subjects. This 
policy is . departure from pre
vious years when the organiza
tions were given free choice as to 
topic. The reason for the change 
is to more fully integrate the 
theme of Carnival and to limit 
the time spent on the construction 
of the floats.
Three Judges
The floats will be judged on or
iginality, aptness of the float to 
the subject, beauty and construc
tion. The floats will be judged 
by Mr. Fred Doorell of Gardner 
Display company, Mr. Rosenberg 
of the P&D department, and Dr. 
Gilmer of the psychology department.
The subjects chosen are (in the 
parade order) :railroads, 1900; the 
Ford; Kittyhawk; Big Stick, 
Theodore Roosevelt; sports, 1905- 
1915; World War I; entertainment, 
1910-1920; the roaring 20s; the 
Lindbergh flight; prohibition; the 
depression: national politics, 1930- 
1940; World War II; outlook for 
the future.
Entire Circus
Sigma Nu won the honors last 
year with the entire fraternity out 
for the parade and composing an 
entire circus. The DUs were sec

while the Delts took show money 
with a delicately colored carou

year's parade.
To Get Carnival Queen Votes
Apparently determined to outdo their male counterparts, Car
negie Techs women are now in the midst of launching one of the 
greatest Spring Carnival Queen campaigns in history.
Their male objectives, still recuperating from their own strenu
ous King of Hearts campaigns, 
have already found themselves 
caught in the whirlwind of 
events.
A comparatively quiet opening 
day has been followed by todays 
all out bid for votes. Only lightly 
affected as yet, Skibo, fraterni
ties, and the dormitories will soon 
be completely enveloped in the 
rush of vote seeking.
Eighteen campus beauties who 
are vieing for the crown promise 
to give the school one of its most 
glamorous courts. The balloting, 
to be held this Friday from 11:30 
a.m. to 1:30 p.m., will narrow the 
field to the seven candidates who 
will comprise the court. The 
i name of the queen, top vote getter 
of the seven, will be withheld.
' however, until the coronation ce
remony.
The coronation will take place 
on Friday, May 12, at 1:00 p.m. 
The ceremony will be held in con
junction with the call day of the 
I five activities honoraries at the 
Sylvan Theater.
As previously announced, the 
voting will be restricted to men, 
while the tabulation of the ballots
will be handled under the much 
discussed Hare system of count
ing.

Growing Up
The announcement in a publication by the 
National Interfraternity Council that college fra
ternities are now making college men, not col
lege boys was verified by Carnegie Tech frater
nities with the recent establishment of a Court of 
Justice by the Council of Fraternity Presidents.
In setting up their own judicial body, the 
fraternities have taken a big step in the direction 
of independency from the school in matters of 
social conduct. Although they are still controlled 
by school-established rules, the fraternities have 
now at least undertaken the task of leveling 
punishment on any member fraternity who vio
lates these rules.
More important than this step toward in
dependency is the underlying fact in CFP's 
decision that Carnegie fraternities have final
ly realized that to keep many of the privileges 
they now enjoy, they must be more conscien
tious in controlling them.
What once w^ere embarrassing and awkward 
situations on many occasions for administrative 
officials to handle, have now' come under the 
jurisdiction of the fraternities themselves. The 
CFP Court of Justice will be less apt to pull its 
punches when leveling action on violating fra
ternities than was the school.
Ah, Spring
Election time is here again! Except that 
this time the campus can be expected to be 
covered with posters until practically the end 
of the school year as four elections must be 
held during the next month.
If for no other reason, Carnegie students 
should be happy when election time rolls around 
because of the spirit which is created during the 
campaigning. It is a tangible measurement of 
campus spirit and students can insure the con
tinuation of such campaigning only by showing 
their interest at the polls.
WANTED  Space
Carnegie Tech isnt the only school faced with 
parking problems. Colleges all over the country 
have found that construction of new buildings, 
coupled with the tremendous increase of students 
owning cars has led to a major problem.
Unless Carnegie officials can find a parking 
area to replace the present one which will be 
closed shortly to make room for the new IA 
building, a drastic step in limiting student 
car ownership may have to be taken.

Letter To The Editor
Solution Sought 
To Dance Losses
The problem of attendance at all-school dances 
has recently been brought to# the attention of 
Student Council, and was placed in the hands of 
the Plans and Programs Committee. It is the job 
of this committee to draw up a plan of solution 
and to present its proposals to Council for ap
proval. *
However, as chairman of this committee, I feel 
that the problem is of such a serious nature as 
to warrant its being brought to the attention of 
the students. Therefore, I urge all students to 
give thorough consideration to this matter and to 
submit any suggestions or criticisms that they 
might have to some member of Student Council.
The problem, as the members of the Plans and 
Programs Committee see it, is this. Every all
school dance that is held on the Carnegie campus 
is in serious danger of losing money, a particu
larly serious matter when it is considered that 
only a certain amount of money is appropriated 
to Council for the purpose of covering such finan
cial losses. When the budget for an all-school 
dance is drawn up, a sizeable profit is estimat
ed; actually, however, this profit figure is no 
more than a reserve which is to be drawn upon 
in the event that expenses exceed the estimated 
income from ticket sales. Until the night of 
any scheduled all-school dance, it is not known 
whether or not the organization sponsoring the 
dance will even so much as break even.
Of the four all-school dances held so far this 
>ear, only one has registered a profit of any ap
preciable amount. Two have just covered ex
penses and the fourth showed a loss. Since the 
success of any dance hinges upon student in
terest and attendance, the responsibility for the 
present situation must be attributed to some ex
tent at least to the students themselves. On the 
other hand, it is more than possible that some 
of the fault lies in the scheduling and planning 
of all-school dances. It is this latter situation 
that the Plans and Programs Committee is striv
ing to correct, but it cannot do so without first 
determining the reason for the lack of student 
support of dances.
Therefore, several pertinent questions must be 
answered before an adequate solution to the 
problem can be reached. First, are there too 
many all-school dances during the year? Second
ly, are the dances poorly scheduled in that they 
occur within too short a time period? Third, do 
the smaller social events occur too frequently or 
conflict in any other way with all-school affairs? 
What other factors affect attendance at dances?
These are the questions that must be answered 
before the Plans and Programs Committee can 
attempt to solve the problem. However, suit
able answers can be found only through student 
opinion. Therefore, I urge all studentsdorm res
idents, commuters, and fraternity mento submit 
suggestions to members of Council. Only in that 
way can we obtain the correct answers, and ar
rive at the correct solution to a problem that af
fects the entire student body.

ALUMNI . . . Bennard Perlman,

INQUIRING REPORTER
Tartan Holds Breath 
But Students Say OK
Hoping to uncover constructive criticism that would be of help 
to the Tartan writers who sometimes scratch their heads and sigh, I 
dont know if this will do, the inquiring reporter asked, What do 
you think of the Tartan? Do you think it represents a complete pic
ture of the news at Carnegie? ?------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Sedgwick, senior: The 
Tartan is a pretty good newspaper 
although it seems a bit disorgan
ized. I imagine 
that this is due 
to the little 
time that any 
Carnegie stu
dent has for 
a c t i v itives. I 
havent follow
ed the paper 
closely this 
year. T gener

est after the 
first few pages. The editorial pol
icy seems fair and unbiased. I like 
the inquiring reporter. I thought 
the article about the students at
Pitt and CIT attitudes toward one
another was interesting. I talked 
to some Pitt students who had 
seen it and they enjoyed it too. 
Sally Lance, senior: I read the 
Tartan almost
every week. It /

waste of time to write them be
cause no one does anything about 
them anyway.
Joey Simmons, sophomore: 
Wonderful. The Tartan has good 
news coverage, 
fine editorials, 
and enough 
space on sports.
I t h ' n k the 
Tartan should 
spend more 
time building 
up stories on 
students and 
articles that 
give knowledge 
on how the 
school is run. I read articles like 
that column that gives students 
opinions on different things to see 
if I know anyone there and what 
they think. Thats what I mean. 
I get the Tartan every week. 
Why, I even take a copy home.
Peppy Erringer, freshman: I
havent read 
the Tartan for

like it all right.
I read about

to see what

After listening to these com
ments, the inquiring reporter 
thought, Do the students really

4TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1950
There is hardly a sports writer in the business who, with 
the opening of the major league baseball season, doesnt like 
to go out on a limband predict how the standings of the 
teams will appear when October rolls around. Therefore, 
since this notable event occurs only once a year (and since 
I am as foolish as the rest in trying to predict the pennant 
winners), I would like to utilize this space for the perfectly 
useless purpose of stating how the two leagues will look 
by the end of the 1950 season.
In the American League the Boston Redsox have the in
dividual ability to win by at least ten games but will win only 
if they decide to play as a team instead of a group of individual 
stars, the principle reason why they failed in 1948 and 1949. 
With such all-around players as Williams, Stephens, Doerr, etc., 
and a pitching staff headed by Parnell, Kinder, and McDermott, 
it is difficult to visualize the Redsox as anything but pennant 
winners.
Detroit and New York should provide the Redsox with 
rugged competition and have more than an outside chance 
to grab the flag. I like the Tigers as runners-up in the 
junior circuit principally because they have a pitching staff 
that ranks with the best in either league. Trout, Trucks, 
Hutchinson, and Houtteman, not to mention Newhouser, 
give Manager Red Rolfe five proven hurlers.
The Yankees, truly a group of professionals down to the 
last man, will be in the fight all the way despite the fact 
that age is beginning to slow such great performers as 
DiMaggio, Henrich, and Rizzuto. There are too many ifs con
nected with the Cleveland Indians and the bottom of the first 
division is as far as Boudreaus boys should be able to climb. 
Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis and Washington round out 
the league in that order.
In the National League, the Brooklyn Dodgers are loaded 
with talent in every department and should win the flag without 
any trouble. With the best catcher and best double-play com
bination in baseball today, plus a slugging first-baseman and so 
many good outfielders they dont know what to do with them 
all, I cant see how the Dodgers can miss the World Series.
Philadelphia, with the youngest team in either league, 
is the best bet for second place in the senior circuit. The 
St. Louis Cardinals are due to slip somewhat due to age in the 
front ranks and lack of good replacements but should be able 
to finish third.
I look for the Pittsburgh Pirates to climb into the first 
division, due chiefly to added infield strength. Kiner can 
still power the ball over the fence, and Beard and Saffell 
give the Pirates added defensive strength in the outfield. Boston, 
New York, Cincinnati, and Chicago form the second division.

for softball.
The most significant change this 
year is the replacement of the 
usual 14 inch ball with the new 
12 inch soft-center ball. This 
should increase the quality of play 
and eliminate high scoring games.

Golf Candidates Fight 
For Squad Positions
Coach Clarence (Buddy) Overend is in the midst of sending 
his varsity golf enthusiasts through a series of qualifying rounds 
in an effort to find the most capable performers for the 1950 squad.
Although Wes Curtis is expected to be the mainstay of the 
team again this year, the firsts 
qualifying round, played last week
over the Pittsburgh Field Club 
layout, revealed a Freshman linksman who may press Curtis for the 
number one position.
Ray Ryabik, touring the Field 
Club layout for the first time, 
posted an 82, low score among the 
candidates. Ryabik parred ten of 
the eighteen holes and led the field 
in match play. Since Curtis could 
not compete due to an injured 
hand, it is not possible to compare 
Ryabik with last years No. 1 man.
Ed Denberg, a regular on the 
1949 team, ranked second in match 
play in the first qualifying round.

Skibo Thinclads Lose To Case; 
Several Close Events Featured
Tartan Display Strength In Track Events, 
Andrews, Wilson, Cooper, Price Record Wins
In a meet closely contested until the final two events, the Car
negie Tech thinclads were defeated 71-60 by Case in the C.I.T. 
Bowl on Saturday. Lagging behind in the earlier events, Carnegie 
swept all three places in the javelin to throw itself back into
?contention.
With the relay and broad jump 
yet to be run, the Skibos needed 
a sweep of both events to win. 
Holding first and second place in 
the broad jump as the relay start
ed, it looked for a moment as 
though the Tartans might rally to 
win.
The Case relay team, off to a 
good start, was never headed, and 
turned in a creditable time of 2:43 
for the 4/5mile to put the meet 
on ice for the Roughriders.
Spurred by the warm weather, 
both teams turned in several good 
performances in both the track 
and field events.
The outstanding performance of 
the day was turned in by Jim An[Continued. on page 5]
Others who performed well were 
Rich Johnson, Dave Dander, Don 
Myers, and Pete Bouska, all mem
bers of last years squad, as well 
as Bud Pellagrini and Leo Schober.
The golfers will open the season 
against Geneva on May 2, with 
the April 28 match with Duquesne 
postponed until May 10.

Skibos Repeat 1949 Win Over St. Francis; 
Squad Strong, In Spite Of Graduation Losses
Coach Eddie Baker unveiled his 1950 edition of the Carnegie 
Tech football team last Tuesday when the Skibos clashed with a 
strong St. Francis team at the CIT Bowl.
The Tartans put cm an excellent exhibition of teamwork, al
though they were forced to play
without the services of such stal
wart regulars as Nick Simcic, 
Floyd Wiseman, Hans Lange, Lar
ry Stovicek, and Elmer Metzger.
Several new faces were present 
on the squad, and they gave new 
V hopes to Dr. Bakers plans for next 
fall. Among these men are Shechter, Connolly, and Ted Leaman. 
All of these boys made a good 
showing in the gjme.
The Skibos scored first when, 
after they had pushed their way 
down to the 15-yard line, Shechter, playing at right halfback, 
skirted left end for the score.
In the next period St. Francis 
came roaring back with a pass 
j from quarterback Graupensberger 
to right halfback Mason that 
netted 60 yards for the touch
down.
The final Tartan touchdown 
came on a pass from Quent Holtz 
to Fritz Wilson, who rounded left 
end for the score. Fullback Gil 
Dissen made the conversion and 
the scoring was ended at 13-6.
One of the bright spots of the 
v game was the display of punting 
' by Ane Oberg. His kicks were 
consistently netting 50 or more 
yards and pulled the Skibos out 
of several rough spots.
Captain Lou Fougere showed 
his old form at end in fighting his 
way through the opponents de
fense and snagging several passes. 
From all indications the leg in
jury that Fougere suffered last 
year will give him no trouble next 
fall.
In an effort to give each man 
on the squad the opportunity to 
display his abilities, Dr. Baker 
used many substitutes.
If the Plaid gridders keep im
proving at their present rate and 
the absent men can retain their 
forms of last year, the 1950 edi
tion of the CIT football team 
should have a very sucessful sea
son come next September,
Tartan Trackmen Lose To Case

drews, a six event man, who in ad
dition to a second and three third 
in other events scored firsts in the 
javelin and broad jump.
Henry, with two firsts in the 
hurdles and a tie for first in the 
pole vault, was high man for Case 
with a total of 14 points. Henrys 
performance in the 120 yd. low 
hurdles probably sets an unofficial 
record for the Skibo track.
As C. I. T. lacks the proper 
facilities for the regulation 220 yd. 
distance, the 120 yd. hurdles are 
run in the Bowl. Records are hard 
to compare for this distance, since 
it is seldom run elsewhere.
Fritz Wilson, who runs the 220
yard dash as if he were wearing 
a football uniform, threshed 
around the track in his unorthodox 
style to win in the time of 23.2, 
one of the better times recorded 
for the Bowl track.
Little John Cooper, whose size 
belies his endurance, finished 
third behind Modie and Koch of 
Case in the mile run. However, 
he wore them down to his size 
for the two mile run and won the 
race far ahead of either of them.
In the 440 dash Fred Price fin
ished first with Don Dimon push
ing him closely. George Dorman 
won the 880 yard run for the Plaid 
in a creditable time. Connie Hammann provided the only other first 
in the field events by winning the 
high jump.
First placs were evenly divided 
between Carnegie and Case, each 
having seven in the individual 
events. The Tartans main weak
nesses seemed to be in the shot 
put, the discus, and the pole vault, 
where they garnered only four out 
of a possible twenty-seven points.
Bob Walters, Theta Xi soccer captain, is shown above as he 
took the ball from two opposing players in last Fridays game be
tween TX and the Dorm Dukes. The Dukes suffered their first 
loss of the season, by a 4-3 score, with Walters scoring three of 
the TX goals.

teams in each league remain on 
the undefeated list.
In the American League Emanon, last years runner-up for the 
school championship, leads with 
two wins while TX, having played 
only one game, is still undefeated.
The TXs downed a powerful 
Dorm Duke team on Friday, 4-3. 
Bob Walters was the key man for 
Theta Xi, booting three balls past 
the Duke goalie, while Henry Carlsen accounted for the fourth point. 
The Dorm Dukes claimed two pre
vious decisive victories, having de
feated ATO 5-1 and the Beta Sigs 
7-0.
In the National League Delta 
Tau Delta, last years school cham
pions, are undefeated with one 
victory over the Phi Kaps, 1-0. 
Sigma Nu remains undefeated with 
a 1-0 victory over the Kappa 
Sigs and a tie with the Phi Kaps. 
The Kappa Sigs claimed wins 
earlier in the week with a forfeit 
over Citcom and a 4-2 victory 
over the DUs.

Sigma Delta Phi 
Sponsors Social 
For New Pledges
Saturday evening, March 26, at 
the Carnegie Union, Sigma Delta 
Phi held an evening social for the 
purpose of introducing the new 
pledges to the members of the 
Fraternity. In as much as this 
was one of the few meetings 
throughout the year to which the 
fairer sex was invited, an unu
sually gala affair was enjoyed by 
all.
The social chairman, George 
Bogovitch, did an excellent job of 
organiing the various games and 
activities so that all were accom
modated. The card sharks had 
their choice of the usual, and it 
was rumored that the dead pan 
boys had a game in progress most 
of the evening. As it was so close 
to payday, a match ante game was 
quite the vogue.
Sunday afternoon, April 16, 
four of the gentlemen who had 
been pledged at the evening so
cial were initiated and taken into 
Sigma Delta Phi. Lester Blano, 
Richard Bottomley, LeRoy Stout; 
enburg, and Don Walker were ^fte 
men so honored.
The meeting was also high
lighted by two interesting talks, 
one by Mr. McDonald on the vari
ous phases of the tin plate indus
try; and another by Mr. Paul 
Brannan on the track signal sys
tem. ' i
The social chairman als<| 
brought forth a proposed social 
calendar for the immediate fu
ture, and up into the start of 
school next fall. This will include 
several dinners, picnics, dances, 
and golf parties.
