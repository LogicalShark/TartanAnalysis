Chelsea Clinton spoke in support of her mother Hillary Satur
day morning at Filinos Ristorante on Carson Street to a group of 
students, families, and Pittsburgh residents. She discussed Iraq, 
healthcare, and education. Clinton argued for a responsible de
parture from Iraq and the importance of taking care of veterans 
once they return home. She talked also of the necessity of afford
able education, giving as examples more reasonable graduate 
school pricing and allowing students to pay back loans based on 
a set percentage of their income. She advocated universal health
care as well as improvements in gay rights, such as getting rid of 
the Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy, and thereby allowing openly gay 
people to serve in the military.

Two weeks after Senator Hil
lary Clintons visit to Pittsburgh, 
Senator Barack Obama spoke to 
a similarly enthusiastic crowd of 
Pittsburghers who filled Soldiers 
and Sailors Memorial Hall on Fri
day to hear what the Illinois sena
tor and presidential hopeful had 
to say. Obama has been campaign
ing intensely in Pennsylvania, as
the state is important for the sen
ator to win in order to receive the 
Democratic nomination.
Senator Bob Casey (D-Pa.) an
nounced his endorsement of Sen
ator Obama at Fridays event.
If theres one thing Pittsburgh 
knows, its that weve got to do 
some pretty hard work, Casey 
said at the event. We can work 
hard, but we can only do so much 
as individuals. We need a presi
dent whps committed to change
and we need a president who will 
lead us in that new direction. 
[Obama] is the kind of leader who 
is ready to be the president of the 
United States.

Harvard 
restricts 
gym hours

For a few hours a week, a gym 
at Harvard University is now 
closed to men. Harvards insti
tution of all-female gym hours 
has caused a nationwide debate 
as to the appropriateness of 
such measures at university fit
ness centers.
The movement at Harvard 
was prompted by a request from 
a group of Muslim women who 
wanted to utilize gym facilities 
but for religious reasons did not 
want to work out in the com
pany of men. The women, who 
. all lived in the same dormitory, 
pitched the idea to their house
master in February, according 
to The New York Times.
- According to Muslim tradi
tion, men and women must 
only wear modest clothing 
when in the presence of one 
another. The Muslim students 
felt that workout clothing was 
a clear violation of the modesty 
stipulation. Their religious tra
dition also prohibits them from 
lying down in front of a man 
before marriage, which can get 
in the way of certain exercise 
positions.
Harvard took action within 
the month, instituting all-fe
male hours at the Quadrangle 
Recreational Athletic Center on 
Mondays from 3 to 5 p.m. and 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
from 8 to 10 a.m., according to 
The New York Times. The Quad
rangle Center is the closest gym 
to the women who made the 
request.
Harvard is not the only uni
versity to take action towards 
female-only gym hours. At uni
versities across the nation, the 
decision has been made not only 
because of religious purposes, 
but also because some women 
simply do not want to work out 
with men.
Wheaton College, Kala
mazoo College, and St. Johns 
College have all made changes 
in order to account for female 
fitness preferences. Wheaton

CHECK INSIDE FOR STUDENT BODY VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCE [A3]
It is good to know that out 
lOth-highest tuition in the coun
try is not going to waste. Car
negie Mellon was reaccredited 
last month by the Middle States 
Commission on Higher Educa
tion, confirming that the uni
versity meets the commissions 
standards for accreditation.
For a university to be re-accredited, there are 14 standards 
that must be fulfilled, according 
to Carnegie Mellons self-study 
report. These include topics 
such as Planning and Resources, 
Student Admissions and Reten
tion, Educational Offerings, and 
Leadership and Governance. 
Accreditation is a process that 
occurs every 10 years; much oi 
the process involves a self-study 
which takes about two and a hali 
years and leads up to a visit by 
the Middle States Commission, 
according to Michael Murphy 
associate vice president.
This self-evaluation focuses 
on only a subset of the 14 ac
creditation standards, although 
there must be documentation 
provided which shows Carn
egie Mellon is still meeting the 
remainder of the standards, ac
cording to the study.
The remaining areas that 
we. proposed for self-study were 
primarily consistent with the 
national focus on issues of as
sessment, including Planning, 
Resource Allocation, Institu
tional Renewal, Institutional 
Resources, Institutional Assess
ment, and Assessment of Stu
dent Learning. The other area oi 
review was General Education, 
in part because our general edu
cation program is distinct within 
each our individual colleges and 
schools, Murphy stated.
In addition to reviewing the 
self-study, the commission also 
met with students at an opening 
dinner and open meeting, which 
all students were invited to at
tend.
The members of the team just 
couldnt say enough about how 
bright and engaged our students 
are  and mature and funny 
and enjoyable to be with  they 
were really blown away by that 
experience, Murphy said.
The commission discussed 
suggestions for improving Carn
egie Mellon, many of which mir
rored the recommendations that 
Carnegie Mellon mentioned in 
its self-study, Murphy said.
The study suggested that the 
university could more clearly 
articulate its goal for students 
in all courses and programs, an 
idea that the commission agreed 
with. Murphy explained that 
the provost, Carnegie Mellons 
senior academic administratoi 
Mark Kamlet, recently estab
lished a University Educational 
Task Force to work toward this 
goal.
The commission also recom
mended that Carnegie Mellon 
should look into expanding its

Congressmen weigh in 
on national electionsCampus debates in race for student body president
ADEYEMI, ^rom Alof campus, they want students to 
have pride in the uniqueness of 
Carnegie Mellon.
Involvement in our student 
organizations, for example, is 
just one of the things you can 
only do here. A fraternity or 
newspaper here is so different 
than what it would be at other 
places, Adeyemi said.
Adeyemi and Short said that 
they take pride not only in our 
campus, but also in making 
change for others.
Student government
shouldnt be a resume thing, 
Short said. We are passionate 
about getting student opinions 
and take pride in getting prob
lems solved.
Adeyemi and Short related 
their campaign to a grassroots 
effort, but said that was what 
they wanted  to bring it all 
back to the students.
More information on theses 
candidates plans for student 
government can be found at 
www.tartanpride.com.
of events, pushing for student 
government accountability will 
aid in effectively changing cam
pus culture, the candidates ex
plained.
To ensure this accountability, 
they have proposed reviving the 
Senate website, publishing meet
ing minutes, holding Executive 
Committee office hours, and re
viving The Gavel, a former stu
dent government newsletter, to 
be passed out person-to-person 
in front of Doherty Hall.
Adeyemi noted instances this 
year where he believes student 
opinions were not accurately re
flected by their Senate represen
tatives.
Two weeks ago, we voted 
26:1 in favor of continuing to 
investigate the +/- grading 
policy, Adeyemi said, I was 
the one against because after 
speaking to my college, I knew 
that the majority of them were 
against it. The Senate vote was 
just mind-boggling to me.
Although Adeyemi and 
Short hope to change aspects
they said.
Its all about change, account
ability, and pride, Adeyemi said 
of the pairs ideas.
In enacting change on cam
pus, Adeyemi and Short noted 
the importance of, small, tan
gible steps.
He mentioned some past 
events and activities that have 
been successful in changing cam
pus culture, for a day at least.
The day that Senate got the 
bikes last year was a great time on 
campus, Adeyemi said. There 
were almost 700 people on the 
Cut and people were happy  it 
was a beautiful thing.
Adeyemi and Short noted that 
similar events can bring the 
campus together, such as buying 
Ritas for a day.
Who doesnt love Ritas? Ad
eyemi asked.
Adeyemi and Short hope that 
these events will bring together 
groups of student organizations, 
thus furthering and unifying 
campus cultures.

2008 elections.
According to Buechner, this 
election is a pivotal one for the 
Democratic Party.
The general election is not 
necessarily John McCains to 
win, but the Democrats to lose, 
Buechner said, explaining that 
the divisiveness of the Demo
cratic Party is an asset to the Re
publicans.
However, Carr pledged his 
support of the Democrats.
Carr, who was a staff member 
for former presidential candi
date Bill Richardsons campaign, 
is a Hillary Clinton supporter, 
despite her current underdog 
status. Richardsons endorse
ment of Obama weighs bn me,; 
Carr said.
According to Carr, one of the 
key problems with Obama is that 
the country is not as familial 
with him as it is with Clinton.
We dont know him, Can 
said. We know a lot more about 
Clinton and what - could be 
brought out negative against her 
in the general election, about 
how she thinks about specific 
issues in detail. It doesnt mean 
that we like what we know, 
but we know. Theres a certain 
amount of knowledge you have 
and you take the good with the 
bad.
Carr justified his support oi 
Clinton not in her familiarity, 
but in her experience.
There is an element of the 
presidency in implementing and 
getting things done, and know
ing where the levers are and how 
the power runs in Washington/' 
he said.
Carr noted that the impor
tance of experience cannot be 
overwritten by campaign cha
risma, such as in the exuberant 
Obama campaign.
A bit of fantasy is exciting 
in that it gets people going, but 
they must educate themselves 
about the limits and adjust ex
pectations, he said.
Buechner agreed with Carr, 
comparing Obamas campaign
with Senate since his sophomore 
year. He is also a tour guide and a 
leader in his fraternity Pi Kappa 
Alpha, most recently serving as 
overall Greek Sing co-chair.
Short is a brother in Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon, where he has 
served in a number of leader
ship roles including his current 
role of president, and has been 
involved in Carnegie United To
wards Increased Effort in Ser
vice (CUTIEs), the Cycling Club, 
and is currently performing re
generative medicine research.
Adeyemi and Short noted 
their sociability as an important 
factor in their campaign.
Were the type of people who 
like to be in the trenches, talk
ing to people, and seeing whats 
going on with them, Short said. 
And getting feedback from stu
dents is such a big part of being 
a leader.
Adeyemi and Short do not have 
a set list of initiatives, as they do 
not want to limit themselves,
Former Congressmen Bob 
Carr (D-Mich.) and Jack Buech
ner (R-Mo.) visited campus this 
past Tuesday and Wednesday, 
reaching out to the community 
through a program sponsored 
by the United States Association 
of Former Members of Congress. 
Carr and Buechner spoke on the 
2008 election, history, and per
sonal careers in politics.
Both congressmen have exten
sive experience in various areas 
of political life.
Carr served in Congress from 
1975 to 1995. He has traveled 
extensively to Russia and inves
tigated a Soviet nuclear weapons 
facility.
Buechner was a congressman 
from 1987 to 1991. In this time, 
he was a representative of the 
U.S. Republican Party to the In
ternational Democratic Union 
following the fall of the Berlin 
Wall.
Buechner spoke about being 
involved in emerging democ
racies as current president of 
the International Republican 
Institute, part of the National 
Endowment for Democracy.
Carr and Buechner shared 
their opinions on the recent rep
utation of the U.S. as gathered 
from their travel experiences.
Carr has come to the opinion 
that although the reputation of 
the U.S. was greatly diminished 
by what he calls the Iraq misad
venture, the country can hope 
to rebuild its credibility and lead 
by example.
Buechner also believes in 
the countrys potential role as a 
leader in the future, particularly 
in the development of democra
cies. He cited evidence from the 
past: When he visited Eastern 
European countries after the 
fall of the Berlin Wall, he noted 
among the attitudes of these 
countries a great surge of belief 
in democracy.
While visiting campus this 
week, Carr and Buechner spoke 
particularly on their views of the
government in local platforms. all so busy and I dont think wed

SAGAR MEHTAEVAN OSHEROFF
Sagar Mehta, a sophomore 
business administration major, 
hopes to bring a fresh perspec
tive to the position of SBVPF. 
Mehta joined JFC this year and 
was the only member not also on 
the Student Senate.
Instead, Mehta came into 
the Senate with leadership ex
perience from several student 
organizations.
Mehta served as the vice presi
dent of Mayur-SASA, an orienta
tion counselor, and treasurer of 
dance group Chak De Bhangra.
Im coming from th outside, 
Mehta said. I knpw the prob
lems and I know how hard the 
process is, so I can address these 
concerns.
Mehtas main platform area 
is the reform of the JFC funding 
process.
Currently, JFC representatives 
are given their organization as
signments in the spring semester 
and are given about three weeks 
to determine what budget will 
be given.
Mehta hopes to move this part 
of the process to the fall semes
ter so that representatives can 
familiarize themselves with 
organizations and the level of 
funding they require.
Mehta also hopes to change 
the way in which organiza
tions apply to be considered for 
budgets.
In the fall, student organiza
tions approved by the Committee
of Student Organizations (CoSO) 
are invited to apply for a chance 
at funding.
According to Mehta, this step 
can be taken away.
Any group recognized by 
CoSO should be able to apply for 
funding, he said. Since almost 
every student organization is ap
proved, removing this step would 
allow for the same groups to get 
funding, but in a quicker, more 
efficient manner, he explained.
Currently, the JFC receives 
about 34 percent of the funds 
acquired from the student activi
ties fee.
Mehta said that it is hard to de
termine how much the student 
activities fee should be raised 
before the process is made more 
efficient. However, he said that if 
he were to suggest a change now, 
he would suggest an increase as 
small as $10 per student.
The student activities fee 
should be used to reward diverse 
interests, Mehta said. In an 
ideal world, it would reach out to 
100 percent of students.
Mehta hopes that the fee can be 
more efficiently allocated so that 
a greater portion of the student 
body comes under the umbrella 
of the JFC.
This is a unique opportunity 
to work with people on campus 
and possess the power to enact 
change in bettering student life, 
he said.
There is a lot that Evan Osheroff, a junior business admin
istration major, wants to do for 
Carnegie Mellon, and all of his 
top priorities fall under the juris
diction of SBVPF. Having served 
on the Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) and Student Senate since 
the beginning weeks of his first 
year, Osheroffsees SBVPF as the 
next natural step in effecting 
change.
Osheroff spent the past two 
years as chair of the Senate Aca
demic Affairs Committee.
When Osheroff began his time 
on JFC, he served 16 small orga
nizations with budgets as small 
as $300. He is now the go-to 
person for large-scale activities, 
most recently Spring Carnival 
2008. Osheroff has also partici
pated in the organizational side 
of JFC.
I have been a resident assistant, 
vice president of the Undergrad
uate Investment Club, co-editor 
of the [Carnegie] Pulse, and a 
member of Pioneers, Osheroff 
said. So I know what its like to 
be in a diverse bunch of groups 
and I can relate.
Osheroff hopes to tackle sev
eral key issues if he is elected 
SBVPF.
He mentioned the importance 
of transparency, in that students 
on campus should know what 
JFC stands for and does. Accord
ing to Osheroff, there are too 
many juniors and seniors who
are not even familiar with the 
term.
Osheroff also hopes to make 
a number of internal changes to 
the JFC.
These changes include an im
proved Budget Tracker website, 
the official site on which orga
nizations submit and see the 
results of JFC budget requests. 
An umbrella issue for a num
ber of Osheroffs platform ideas 
is the improved allocation of 
funds.
Osheroff noted that run-offs, 
or money left unused from bud
gets, can run as high as $50,000 
and, if used correctly, these 
could result in better bands and 
comedians for Carnival or more 
service opportunities for smaller 
groups.
Osheroff said that the student 
activities fee plays a key role in 
improving allocation and in
creasing student opportunities.
An increase as small as $15 
could result in an additional 
$90,000 to give to student 
groups, he said.
For Osheroff, the best thing 
about serving as SBVPF would 
be the ability to immediately en
act change.
Im most excited to be able 
to make change myself instead 
of convincing other people, 
he said. Ive really seen whats 
needed and know what works 
and what doesnt.

Congressmen offer election insights
Allison Piper/Assistant Photo Editor
Congressmen Bob Carr (D-Mich.) and Jack Bueclyier (R-Mo.) visited 
campus to share their thoughts on the upcoming national elections.
sopyenrrk from A3
and possible presidency to a pep 
rally before a big sports game.
I liken it to a football game, 
where at the pep rally, the cheer
leaders and everyone gets all 
revved up, and you run through 
and get out on the field, but the 
person across from you still 
weighs 30 pounds more and is six 
inches taller, Carr said. All that 
exuberance only lasts so long and 
you got to be able to have the foot 
to put on the pedal.
Carr and Buechner recognized 
that such exuberance in both 
Obama and Clintons campaigns 
has resulted in quite an exciting 
election.
Carr said that the competition 
is good for the Democrats in that 
it has energized both the party 
and voters as well has having 
helped an unknown candidate, 
Obama, spring to the forefront. 
Both agreed that the rivalry on
the Democratic side is also ben
eficial in that it has generated ex
citement in the electoral process 
and motivated voters, especially 
first-time voters, to become in
volved in the process.
Buechner recognized that with 
the growing number of voters, 
the difficulty of choosing a can
didate in this years election has 
also increased.
Buechner offered a unique 
perspective of Clinton from the 
point of view of his fiancee. A 
middle-aged woman, she feels 
torn between Clinton and Obama 
because while fitting the charac
teristics of a Clinton supporter, 
she feels so drawn to Obamas 
message. Buechner surmised' 
that this may be an example of 
the dilemma of similarly aged 
women of all races.
As for John McCain, Buechner 
recognized his experience but 
cited his anger problem, sharing a 
recent anecdote of a conversation
he had with friends.
They said to me, Id rather 
have John McCain pick up the 
phone at three in the morning. I 
said, John McCain wouldnt take 
your call!
Despite the hard decision of 
whom to vote for, made espe
cially challenging this year, both 
expressed excitement over the in
volvement levels of voters in this 
election.
Buechner said that in his 35 
years in electoral politics, this is 
the first time he has seen young 
people really make a positive 
contribution. The only other 
comparable time was in 1968, 
but the infamous Democratic 
convention that year sullied the 
activism, according to Buech
ner. In 1968, thousands of young 
people showed up at the conven
tion to express their anti-war sen
timents, only to be attacked, by 
means such as tear gas and clubs, 
by the citys police.
Carr added that student in
volvement in the Vietnam era 
had a high issue content, as more 
young voters had a viable stake 
in issues pertinent to them, such 
as the draft. However, this is not 
the case today, as there are no is
sues as relevant to young people 
as the draft was, he said.
Carr described the involvement 
of young voters today as Ameri
can Idol politics; its as if young 
voters are intently watching the 
television series, proclaiming 
themselves fans of one candidate 
or the other, he explained.
Carr and Buechner agreed 
upon the need for voters to not 
get carried away in the pop cul
ture stardom of the election and 
focus on issues.
Carr urged voters to listen 
with skepticism: Decide from the 
head, not the heart.
History department hosts first real-life 
Pittsburgh policy case competition
ubupau sotn
Pillbox Editor
On Friday, April 4, Carnegie 
Mellon students will tackle the 
real-life issues of Pittsburgh, in a 
case competition at least. The his
tory department is hosting its first 
History and Policy Case Competi
tion, in which each team proposes 
a policy solution to a given case, 
and the team with the best solu
tion is awarded $200.
The case, which has remained 
a secret to everyone but the orga
nizers, will be revealed to the stu
dent teams on Friday.
Students, who must work in 
teams of three to five, will work 
on the case for one week, finish
ing the competition with a presen
tation on April 13. The policy case 
study is taken from an actual issue 
in Pittsburgh to give the event lo
cal relevance.
The idea to hold the competi
tion started with junior business 
administration and history and 
policy double major Alexander 
Dileonardo, who submitted a pro
posal about a year ago to Caroline 
Acker, a professor in the depart
ment and faculty adviser for the 
competition. According to Dileon
ardo, the idea came from business 
case competitions.
As students, we study the his
tory in the classroom and read 
books and write papers, but I dont 
think that necessarily prepares 
you for a job where you work with 
policy issues, said Dileonardo, 
explaining his idea.
When [he] approached me
with this idea, I instantly thought 
it was exciting and wanted to sup
port it, Acker stated in an e-mail.
In the competition, the case 
was selected by Acker, along with 
fellow history department faculty 
Jay Aronson, David Hounshell, 
John Soluri, and Joel Tarr.
I think the case competition 
is a worthwhile idea [because] 
policymakers often have to make 
decisions or recommendations in 
limited time with limited informa
tion, Acker wrote. Having teams 
of students intensively study a 
current policy issue will prepare 
them for this situation.
Acker also commented that stu
dents knowledge of history will 
help them make better decisions 
during the competition.
The competition will occur over 
nine days. On the first day, the 
teams receive their case. Student 
teams will write short proposals 
for the presentation, which will 
be judged by a panel including lo
cal government officials familiar 
with the given issue.
Before writing their proposals, 
students must conduct research 
and analyze the policy. Books on 
reserve at Hunt Library will help 
the teams with their research, 
simplifying the process by elimi
nating the need to find sources 
individually.
Despite the fact that the history 
department is hosting the compe
tition, it is open to non-history ma
jors as well; any student who has 
taken at least one history course 
besides Introduction to World His
tory is eligible to participate.
While teams are required for 
competition, students may enter 
individually. Individual partici
pants are placed on teams on the 
first day of the competition at the 
kickoff event, which will begin at
3 p.m. this Friday in the Adamson 
Wing (BH 136A). Students may 
also register in groups.
Presentations will take place 
April 13 starting at 4 p.m. in Stein
berg Auditorium (BH A53). All 
students are welcome to attend 
this final round, where the win
ners will be announced. The win
ning team will be awarded $200.
The history department plans 
to hold one competition per se
mester for all upcoming semes
ters, each of which will be focused 
on a local issue.
The proposal sent in was ap
proved for this semester and the 
history department funded the 
whole thing, Dileonardo said. 
They said they will fund 50 per
cent for every semester from now 
on.
The rest of the funding for 
future events must come from 
fundraising, as the department 
believes that after interest has 
been aroused this year, it will be 
easier to gain access to the neces
sary funding.
Itll be a great experience for 
all of the students [involved], 
Dileonardo said.
Any student wishing to partici
pate in this semesters competi
tion must register by Thursday, 
April 3, by e-mailing Alexander 
Dileonardo at adileona@andrew. 
cmu.edu.
Middle States visits Carnegie Mellon

general education initiatives. Spe
cifically, the commission encour
aged programs that develop writ
ing skills, in addition to improving 
science and quantitative reason
ing requirements in non-science 
disciplines, according to Murphy.
The university should con
tinue its vigorous self-examina
tion of the relationship of liberal 
and professional education, and 
continue to review the extent to 
which our colleges, schools, and 
major programs integrate the gen
eral education component, the 
Middle States report said.
Additionally, the commission 
stressed the importance of a di
verse and active student involve
ment in extracurricular activities.
The university should expand 
student and faculty participation 
in the development of metacurricular programs (e.g., festivals, me
dia, library events, guest speak
er^ and artists), enhancing the
intellectual and artistic richness 
of campus life for the extended 
university community, the report 
said.
In addition to making sugges
tions for future changes, the com
mission also praised a number of 
aspects of the university.
The commission made no rec
ommendations at all in the areas 
of institutional leadership and 
planning, and also supported the 
distinct way general education is 
developed within the curricula of 
each of the colleges and schools, 
Murphy said.
A number of changes have been 
made since the last accreditation 
visit in 1998.
One of the greatest changes 
that can be seen clearly on campus 
is the rise in diversity at Carnegie 
Mellon. Murphy explained that 
the commission raised issues of 
diversity during the last visit, and 
that it has been a very important 
focus area for President Jared L. 
Cohq^ throughout his time at the
university.
Other changes include en
hancements in library services,- 
leadership development, research 
in critical areas, and regional 
impact.
I think its really great to see 
all the positive changes made at 
Carnegie Mellon since 1998, and 
I hope that the latest visit by the 
commission helps the university to 
continue to grow, stated Simona 
Saracco, a sophomore materials 
science and engineering major.
Currently, Carnegie Mellon is 
working on its 2008 strategic plan 
process. A strategic plan is deter
mined after each accreditation 
every 10 years to allow the univer
sity to set goals and better itself in 
light of its self-study, the commis
sions suggestions, and changes 
since the last plan. April will be 
a big month filled with campus 
meetings that all students, faculty, 
and staff are encouraged to attend 
so that everyone can be involved 
in the strategic planning process.
Obama speaks on campaign issues
ohubuk fromAl
down Fifth Avenue, as a small 
group of Hillary Clinton sup
porters assembled across the 
street to taunt the formidable 
crowd with pro-Clinton signs. 
The audience was a mix of labor 
workers, union organizers, col
lege students, parents with their 
children, and other members of 
the community.
Senator Obama began his 
speech by acknowledging some 
domestic issues, particularly 
those relevant to the lower 
classes.
Everywhere you go, people 
are working harder and harder 
to pay the bills every month. 
Youve never paid more for gas 
out of your pocket, for health 
care, for a college education, 
he said. Co-payments are going 
up, deductibles are going up, gas 
prices are going up. Our health 
care system leaves 47 million 
people without health insur
ance.
Obama explained his plan for 
improving health care for all 
Americans by the end of his first 
term, emphasizing that those 
who have insurance will have 
lower premiums, and those with
out will have the option of re
ceiving government-subsidized 
health insurance if they cant af
ford insurance on their own.
In addition, he said that he 
wanted to start a home fore
closure prevention fund to al
low more people to stay in their 
homes, in addition to creating 
after school programs for chil
dren; improving safety, health, 
and environmental standards 
for free trade; and investing in 
the countrys infrastructure.
He said that he would strive to 
lower college tuition and make 
a college education a reality for 
everyone, regardless of income, 
though he did not address the 
youth voter population directly.
But above all, Obama stressed 
the imminent need for change.
We cant afford to wait. We 
cant wait to fix our schools, we 
cant wait to fix our healthcare 
system, we cant wait to have an 
energy policy that makes sense 
in this country, we cant wait to . 
bring this war in Iraq to an end, 
we cannot wait! he said
However, he also cautioned

not be easy.
Understand how much work 
we have to do. We cant afford to 
look at the world through rosecolored glasses. Weve got a lot 
of work to do because weve dug 
a big hole for ourselves, he said. 
The only way change is going 
to happen is if we change how 
business is done in Washington. 
People dont feel like Washing
ton is listening because its not 
listening.
Obama said that the main dif
ference between his and Sena
tor Clintons ideologies was that 
Clinton was not as adamant 
about decreasing U.S. depen
dence on foreign oil and turn
ing to renewable energy. But he 
also said that the two had dif
ferent opinions about how the 
environment in Washington 
must change in order for policy 
change to occur.
I think that Senator Clinton is 
a smart and capable person, he 
said. But she seems to think that 
all we need to do is change polit
ical parties and kind of work the 
system. But what Im going to say 
is, we dont just need to play the 
game in Washington, we need to 
put an end to the game-playing 
in Washington.
He also said that Clinton ac
cepted money from lobbyists,
whereas he did not, relying in
stead on the American people.
I cant do it by myself. Ive got 
to have you with me, he said to 
the crowd.
Candice Gesecki, a senior 
chemical engineering major, 
and Miriam Savad, a senior psy
chology and decision sciences 
major, were among the Carnegie 
Mellon students in attendance at 
the rally.
I liked his idea of supporting 
college tuition through public 
service, Gesecki said. But he 
could have been specific about 
how hes going to make those 
changes. I wanted to hear more 
specifics on policies.
Gesecki plans to keep up with 
both Clinton and Obama before 
she makes her final decision 
about which candidate will get 
her vote.
Savad is also undecided.
Id like to see democracy 
represented again, she said. 
Either Obama or Hillary could 
potentially do a lot of things. I 
will vote for who I think is going 
to beat McCain, and who I think 
will win the election.
Both Savad and Gesecki in
tend to vote in the Pennsylvania

Carnegie Mellons Open Learning Initiative (OLI) re
cently hosted a symposium called Opening Learning Inter
play. The symposium aimed at creating a platform where 
learning scientists and open educational resource (OER) 
developers could interact and share innovative ideas.
OER developers create web-based learning materials 
that are available online for free use. Learning scientists, 
on the other hand, study how learning occurs and what en
vironments are best suited for learning.
The primary goal of the symposium was to bring to
gether the learning science research community with the 
open educational resource development community to 
begin to explore how working collaboratively between the 
two communities might support them each better, said 
Candace Thille, the OLI director.
Thille also said that the symposium instructed OER de
velopers in helping learning scientists teach students out
side the classroom. The symposium thus provided both 
communities with valuable information and was a learn
ing experience for both.
OLI came up with the idea of the symposium as it has
been employing such collaborative techniques for quite 
some time. According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, 
OLI has developed a number of online courses in subjects 
as diverse as chemistry and French ever since 2002.
OLI aims to create environments that are conducive to 
learning, to help users take away as much as they would 
in a classroom. With this goal in mind, materials were de
signed by the combined effort of learning scientists, OER 
developers, faculty experts in each subject, and software 
engineers.
We found that the most effective way of developing 
those environments was through this team-based develop
ment approach, Thille said. Since this strategy was so ef
fective, OLI decided to share the strategy with other OER 
developers through the symposium.
The symposium, sponsored by the William and Flora 
Hewlett Foundation and the Pittsburgh Science of Learning 
Center, brought together learning scientists from different 
institutions including the University of California at Berke
ley, Stanford University, and the University of London, in 
addition to OER developers from around the country.
The symposium suggested strategies for the improve
ment of open educational resources, but it did not under
mine the fact that such resources have been drafting a
change in the educational system already. Catherine Casserly, director of the open educational resources initiative 
at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation said, I think 
[OER developers have] done a pretty great job of begin
ning to equalize access and to unlock knowledge that had 
previously been held private by universities and other in
stitutions.
A variety of OERs, such as papers and reviews on culture 
and customer-centered design, have already been laid out 
on the OER website.
Such resources are not merely another reservoir of in
formation, they actually teach the material to the students. 
Were not just putting up the material that supports the 
traditional course, were actually designing environments 
to teach students even if they are not in class, Thille said.
The challenge now lies in making such resources more 
accessible and user-friendly. This is where the combination 
of learning scientists and OER developers comes into play.
The idea [of the symposium] was to feed information 
from the learning sciences that Carnegie Mellon has been 
so exemplary at into the work that were doing in open 
education resources, Casserly said, both to level the

Consortium will conduct 
fossil fuel research
bued-b swupapu
SciTech Editor
A triple-university consortium 
comprised of Carnegie Mellon 
University, University of Pitts
burgh, and West Virginia Uni
versity has been approved fund
ing worth $26 million through 
a subcontract with RDS Inc., 
an on-site contractor at the Na
tional Energy Technology Labo
ratory (NETL), to produce clean 
and efficient energy preserva
tion technologies for the use of 
fossil fuels.
CWP Inc., as the consortium 
has been named, will receive 
this funding over a period of 
two years, while the three uni
versities work in close collabo
ration with NETL scientists and 
researchers to explore the many 
aspects of fossil fuel research. 
Partnership in the consortium 
will boost growth and expan
sion of the universities research 
aspects in all areas of energy 
preservation.
NETL is the national labora
tory for the U.S. Department of 
Energys Office of Fossil Energy.
According to the NETL web
site, the research lab is a pioneer 
in the scientific and technologi
cal disciplines of gasification  
the conversion of carbon-based 
substances (such as coal) into 
synthesis gas. This synthesis gas 
is then used along with domestic 
fuel reserves to generate clean 
electrical energy, petrol, and 
other chemicals.
The laboratory owns facili
ties across five states, including
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Andrew J. Gellman, Lord 
Professor of chemical engineer
ing and research director for 
the consortium, said that the 
consortium is an effort to bring 
together the unique abilities of 
the three science-oriented insti
tutions and NETL in a mutually 
beneficial partnership.
The consortium will be 
staffed by 24 primary faculty 
members, about 60 or 70 gradu
ate students, and post-doctoral 
fellows from Carnegie Mellon, 
said Gellman.
Gellman and his team special
ize in developing surface science 
methods  innovative tech
niques to study mechanical and 
chemical processes occurring on 
surfaces.
We have certain facilities that 
NETL does not have, while they 
have on-site facilities we dont 
have, Gellman said.
The research will be focused 
on continuously developing 
different methods for captur
ing fossil fuel combustion in an 
efficient and environmentally 
friendly manner. However, 
while fossil fuel study is an inte
gral mission of the consortium, 
the research portfolio remains 
very broad. The researchers will 
concentrate on a total of eight 
program areas.
Carbon dioxide entrapment 
and conversion of oil to various

Wednesday after its 16-day mis
sion to the International Space 
Station, the longest excursion 
of its kind since construction of 
the station began.
The missions main objec

Over the 12-day period they 
spent at the station, the eight 
Endeavour astronauts per
formed five spacewalks, three 
to assemble Dextre, and the 
remaining two to initiate ex
periments and examine a faulty 
rotary joint on a truss holding 
solar panels.
This is the greatest number 
of spacewalks completed since

ECE team takes third place in IC Design contest
Students and developers come together in a learning science symposium
Abhishek Jajoo, Leon Wang, and John Reinke at an EGO (ECE Graduate Student Organization) event.

Staffwriter
A team from CMUs ECE de
partment, composed of graduate 
students Abhishek Jajoo, John 
Reinke, and Leon Wang, recently 
won third place in the first phase 
of the 2007-2008 SRC/SIA IC De
sign Challenge. The team, led by 
faculty advisers Tamal Mukherjee and Gary Fedder, submitted 
the award-winning design titled 
A Tunable Multiband RF MEMS 
Transceiver Front-End.
The theme of the competition 
this year was Performing At The 
Limits, with the objective of cre
ating novel, high-performance 
circuit designs that create more 
competitive end products.
A transceiver is a radio frequency 
transmitter/receiver, most com
monly used in cell phones, WiFi 
devices, and Bluetooth. Conven
tual industry transceivers can
only operate at individually fixed 
frequencies  in other words, 
transceiver circuitry tuned to cell 
phone frequencies cannot be used 
to receive WiFi or Bluetooth.
As a result, a cell phone that uses 
three standards of radio transmis
sion (phone, WiFi, and Bluetooth) 
would need to have three trans
ceivers tuned separately to each 
frequency band of transmission 
and reception.
The winning teams design, 
however, aims to change that 
with its innovative strategy. By 
utilizing the latest technology in 
microelectromechanical systems 
(MEMS), the teams circuit is ca
pable of receiving and transmit
ting on several different bands of 
radio transmission, eliminating 
the need for multiple transceivers 
in devices.
In essence, were developing 
the one circuit that does it all, 
Reinke s%id.
During the. first phase of the 
competition, the eight participat
ing teams designed the circuit 
and submitted a proposal for 
evaluation; only the five most 
promising teams will advance to 
the second phase, scheduled for 
later this year.
In the second phase, the five 
teams designs will be fabricated 
for free, a process which would 
cost several thousand dollars on 
its own. Next, judges will test the 
devices circuitry to determine 
the final winner, who will receive 
a prize of $25,000. According to 
a Carnegie Mellon press release, 
all eight teams will exhibit their 
posters at TECHCON 2008, a 
two-track international technol
ogy conference.

Genes trigger 
schizophrenia
Recent studies have shown 
that previously unknown genetic 
mutations may increase the risk 
of a person developing schizo
phrenia. The study was conduct
ed by the National Institute of 
Mental Health, the University 
of Washington, and Cold Spring 
Harbor Laboratory.
For the study, researchers col
lected blood samples from 150 
schizophrenic individuals and 
268 people who did not suffer 
from any psychiatric disorder. 
They then used new, high-resolution techniques that scan the 
entire DNA sequence to detect 
mutations that disrupted the 
performance of the normal 
genes.
Fifty-three such mutations 
were detected, and scientists 
observed that these mutations 
were three times as likely in 
people suffering from schizo
phrenia than in those who did 
not.

Dementia linked to 
belly fat
New studies suggest that peo
ple who have large bellies dur
ing their 40s are at a high risk of 
developing Alzheimers disease 
and other forms of dementia by 
the time they reach their 70s.
The study examined data 
from 6583 people whose belly 
fat was calculated during a 
health study in the years 1964 
to 1973. Researchers observed 
that increased abdominal fat led 
to an increased risk of demen
tia.
These findings were indepen
dent of the total weight of the 
people. The body mass index 
(BMI) was not related to the 
development of dementia, as 
people with low BMI but high 
belly fat were also at high risk of 
developing the disorder.
Scientists suspect that the 
reason for this is that fat near 
the inner organs is more metabolically active than other fat 
and constantly pumps out harm
ful toxins.

The drugs in question are Ziagen 
and Videx, products of the two 
manufacturers, respectively.
The announcement was 
made after a study showed that 
patients taking Ziagen or Viadex 
were at a greater risk of suffering 
from heart attacks than patients 
taking other drugs.
While the drugs are still being

Body piercing has been popular 
as an ancient cult and traditional 
practice in many societies. To
day, it is fairly comnionplace, and 
many people enjoy getting vari
ous piercings. Body piercings can 
be seen as a form of expression or 
art or simply a stylish commod
ity. Unfortunately, piercings can 
often get infected, which causes 
problems.
Infected piercings can actually 
be very serious. Health risks from 
piercings include HIV, Hepatitis B 
and C, as well as many other dis
eases and disorders. Therefore, 
prior to trying out an eccentric 
piercing, it is important to know 
the repercussions of an infected 
piercing, as well as means of 
treatment.
Since a piercing is virtually 
an open wound, there are many 
ways that a piercing can become 
infected. If a sterile technique 
is not used during the piercing 
process, bacteria can get into the 
wound. To ensure a safe piercing, 
make sure the person performing 
the procedure has a license to do 
so. He or she should also wash 
their hands and wear gloves.
Today, many locations use 
nitrile gloves due to the vast num
ber of people with latex allergies. 
The piercer should use a sterile 
needle or piercing gun. It is also 
a good idea to make sure that the 
piercing parlor itself is not dirty.
If the jewelry used after a pierc
ing is not sterile or is allergenic, it
can cause an allergic reaction and 
infection. Thus, be aware of your 
metal allergies before opting for a 
piercing. Most piercings are done 
using titanium or sterling silver. 
If people have white metal aller
gies, they choose pure gold jew
elry for their piercings.
Also, earrings with short posts 
can also cause infection, as the 
clasp can press too tightly against 
the skin, blocking air.
In this situation, cleaning so
lution cannot get into the space 
between the clasp and the skin, 
allowing bacteria to settle and 
breed.
Symptoms of piercing infec
tions vary from person to person. 
For the most part, an infected 
piercing will be painful, red, and 
swollen.
Other symptoms include itchi
ness and presence of pus. In addi
tion, you can tell that a piercing 
is probably infected if it does not 
heal within a couple of weeks. 
The beginnings of any irregular 
illnesses following the piercing 
can also be signs of infection.
Infected piercings can also re
sult in scar tissue formation. For 
example, keloids are fairly com
mon. A keloid is an oversized skin 
growth that occurs within scar 
tissue.
Keloids can grow as large as the 
earlobe itself. They are slightly 
pale due to a restricted supply of 
blood. The only way to get rid of 
a keloid is to have it surgically 
removed, although the likeli
hood that it will return is usually 
higher than 50 percent.
Some people are more sus
ceptible to keloid formation and 
should take extra care of their 
piercings in order to minimize 
their chances of forming a keloid.
Infected piercings can gener
ally be treated at home. Some
times, however, a medical profes
sional may need to be consulted. 
In its early stages, an infection
can usually be eliminated within 
two or three days.
The jewelry should be taken out 
and thoroughly cleaned with rub
bing alcohpl or water and baking 
soda. The piercing itself should 
also be thoroughly cleaned and 
flushed out with warm water.
Then, the jewelry should be 
soaked in a solution of warm wa
ter and sea salt for 10 minutes, 
three timfes a day. Sometimes, 
the jewelry can be put back in 
after the initial cleaning if the 
wound has not closed, but the 
jewelry must still be soaked on 
a daily basis. If the piercing does 
not improve, approach a medical 
professional.
Fortunately, piercing infec
tions are totally preventable. Af
ter going to the piercing parlor or 
stand, the piercing professional 
should give the customer a list of 
instructions on how to care for 
the piercing. They should also 
provide a bottle of solution to 
clean the piercing with. Typically, 
earlobe piercings are the easiest 
to clean and fastest to heal.
Cartilage, tragus (the small 
pointed part of the ear that pro
trudes toward the inner hollow), 
and nose piercings often take 
longer to heal  usually around 
12 weeks. Moreover, they can 
be hard to clean. Cartilage and 
tragus piercings are most likely 
to get infected because of their 
sensitive position. Ensuring clean 
needles or piercing guns, in addi
tion to after-care for piercings are 
essential for piercing-lovers look
ing to prevent infection.

To the untrained eye, Gliese 
581 c is an inconspicuous body 
circling an inconspicuous star. 
The star, Gliese 581, is 20.5 light 
years away from Earth. It has an 
orbital eccentricity of 0.16 (the 
parameter of the conic section 
of the orbit), an orbital period 
of 12.932 sidereal days (that is, 
it takes roughly 13 days to com
plete a revolution about its star), 
and a mass of 0.0158 J (Jupiter 
masses). This is potentially inter
esting data. But without any 
means for comparison, it is dif
ficult to know why.
Roughly speaking, a body cir
cling a star is called a planet. 
Pluto was excluded as a planet 
because it did not dominate 
its surroundings or obtain its 
round shape due to the force of 
its own gravity. Before 1995, the 
thought of finding a planet in 
our universe outside of our solar 
system was a pipe dream. Thus, 
Gliese 581 cs categorization as 
an exoplanet is already cause 
for celebration.
But there is more to the story. 
To interpret this data, one must 
examine similar values for Earth, 
which has an orbital eccentric
ity of 0.017, an orbital, period 
of 365.26 sidereal days, and a 
mass of 0.00315 J. One could 
say this approximate similarity 
to Earth is interesting. But call
ing Gliese 581 c an interesting 
planet could be the astronomical 
understatement of the century.
Exoplanets (short for extraso
lar planets) are planets outside 
of our solar system. Exoplanets 
have been the subject of intense 
scientific investigation since the 
1990s, when several of them 
were flagged by astronomers as 
being potential bearers of extra
terrestrial life.
The first exoplanet discovered 
was 51 Pegasi b, found in 1995 
by a Swiss team led by Didier 
Queloz. In 2001, the discovery 
was authenticated by research
ers Jeff Marcy and Paul Butler 
working with the Keck twin tele
scopes in Hawaii.
The discovery of 51 Pegasi 
b was exciting in part because 
it was thought to be a terres
trial planet. Terrestrial planets 
are comprised of silicate rock 
surrounding a central, metallic 
core. The Earth is a terrestri
al planet, and any planet that 
exhibits Earth-like characteris
tics is immediately attractive as 
a life source. But further inspec------------^----------------------------------
tion revealed that 51 Pegasi b is 
most likely a gaseous giant, like 
Jupiter.
Finding planets is challenging, 
but finding Earth-like analogs is 
nearly impossible. The Earth is 
positioned in a myriad of pecu
liar and subtle angles that make 
it improbably well-suited to lifebearing properties, like photo
synthesis.
If Earth was thrown slightly 
off its axis or nudged slightly 
closer to the sun, the life-giving 
environment of Earth would be 
thrown into colossal disarray.
Earth thus resides in a near
perfect habitable zone (HZ). The 
habitable zone of a solar system 
is the area of space surround
ing a star where conditions are 
maximally suitable to sustain 
life. These conditions include the 
planets temperature, density, 
pressure, radiation content, mat
ter content, and distance from 
the star it orbits.
In the April 2008 issue of 
Scientific American, Nancy Kang 
wrote about using photosynthe
sis as an additional marker to 
characterize extrasolar planets. 
This is fairly easily accomplished 
by examining the spectrum of 
the stars light.
Depending on the planets 
------------------------------------------------
distance from a star, plants on 
the surface of exoplanets could 
appear blue, red, or black.
How, then, do astronomers 
go about finding another planet 
that is as perfect as Earth? They 
hunt. Since the discovery of 51 
Pegasi b, over 270 exoplanets 
have been discovered.
The exoplanet HD 209458b 
was discovered in 1999 orbit
ing the star HD 209458. Like 51 
Pegasi b, HD 209458b is another 
extrasolar planet in the constel
lation Pegasus. The discovery 
of this planet marked several 
experimental milestones. Most 
notably, it was the first extrasolar 
planet that contained an atmo
sphere (carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen). The atmosphere also 
contained water vapor, another 
first for an extrasolar planet.
The exoplanet SWEEPS-10 
has, to date, the fastest orbital 
period in the universe, zipping 
through one day in 10 hours. 
Another exoplanet, Upsilon 
Andromeda b, perpetually faces 
its star, incinerating one side of 
the planet while plunging the 
other side into frigid tempera
tures.
The planet HD 209458b is so 
close to its star that its atmo
sphere is being blasted away
------------------------------------^---------
at the rate of 10,000 tons of 
material every second.
Gliese 581 c is the first exo
planet found to He within the 
HZ of its star. The planet is ter
restrial, and large; Gliese 581 ,c 
is five times more massive than 
Earth. Scientists have further 
speculated that Gliese 581 c is 
either entirely terrestrial or cov
ered with oceans.
With exoplanets being discov
ered at a now-rapid rate, it is a 
sprint to keep up to date with the 
wildly fascinating and potential
ly life-bearing, exoplanets that 
are coming into view.
In about a decade, the 
European Space Agency will 
launch Darwin, a planet-finding 
fleet of probes armed with three 
telescopes that will scope out, 
image, and analyze thousands 
of small, rocky Earth-sized exo
planets.
NASAs Terrestrial Planet 
Finder will also use high-sensitivity telescopes to study the 
development, composition, and 
size of similar Earth-like exo
planets.
When these projects take 
flight, our universe will come to 
life like never before by reveal
ing that Earth, in all its splendor, 
may have some relatives.

The Aptera, a new car set for 
production later in 2008, unites 
cutting-edge ideas of automotive 
aerodynamics with advanced 
composite manufacturing tech
nology (combining materials 
to improve their strengths). A 
white-painted, teardrop-shaped 
vehicle, this two-person car is 
likely to turn heads  and alter 
the landscape for the future of 
personal transportation.
Featuring a lightweight, care
fully shaped composite shell to 
reduce drag, or wind resistance 
that slows the car down, the 
Aptera is at the forefront of fuelefficient design. According to the 
Aptera Motors website (www. 
aptera.com), the cars designers 
used software programs such as 
Computational Fluid Dynamics 
to analyze shape and to maxi
mize efficiency, as well as Finite 
Element Analysis to ensure that 
the cars body is lightweight, 
robust, and manufacturable.
Formerly Accelerated 
Composites, Aptera Motors is 
based in San Diego. The Aptera 
vehicle, once manufacturing 
begins later this year, will at first 
only be available in California.
This is largely due to the need 
for consumers to be able to have 
their cars maintained and ser
viced. Until the vehicle is pro
duced on a larger scale, such ser
vice must stay regional.
Technically classified as a
motorcycle in California for its 
three-wheeled system (with two 
front wheels and one in the rear), 
the Aptera can be driven in HOV 
lanes, but its drivers do not need 
to acquire a motorcycle license
 a regular drivers license will 
do  or wear helmets due to the 
enclosed shape.
The novel product does feature 
such safety systems as airbag-inseatbelt technology and a firewall 
that will redirect energy around 
the outside shape of the car body 
and away from the occupants. 
Moreover, it features a frontal 
crumple distance of 45 inches, 
which is large proportionally in 
relation to the size of the vehicle.
All three wheels will have dual 
hydraulic brakes in addition to 
the rear regenerative brake.
To reduce the chance of rollover, 
which is a general fear with three
wheeled vehicles, the Aptera has 
traction control and a low center 
of gravity. Furthermore, in addi
tion to performing physical crash 
tests, Aptera Motors is perform
ing visual crash test simulations 
using software analysis programs 
to predict the impact of front and 
side crashes to the vehicle.
While performing these safe
ty exercises, meeting and even 
exceeding certain California 
standards, the Aptera is rather 
progressive in its automotive 
capabilities.
The Mk-0 proof-of-concept 
model has a drag coefficient of
0.11, which, while higher than 
initially desired, gets about 230
miles per gallon at 55 miles per 
hour on a fully charged battery.
That is, the Aptera is an electric 
and gasoline hybrid: It is a series 
hybrid with direct belt drive, 
available in an all-electric ver
sion (which is estimated to cost 
$26,900) and a plug-in hybrid 
version (which is estimated to 
cost $29,900).
Designed as an extended range 
electric vehicle, the Typ-le Aptera 
is electric and designed to use a 
10-kilowatt battery pack, while 
the lyp-lh plug-in hybrid Aptera 
is designed to use a smaller pack.
The battery will have a two to 
four hour charge time, which will 
only cost approximately $l-$2, 
according to California electric
ity prices. The expected mileage 
range for both models is about 
120 miles on a fully charged bat
tery, which helps present Aptera 
Motors as the current front-runner in the recently announced 
Automotive X PRIZE, a venture 
of the X PRIZE foundation spon
sored by Progressive.
The first Aptera prototype, the 
Mk-0, was a parallel hybrid diesel 
vehicle with no electric assist and 
averaged 230 miles per gallon 
at 55 miles per hour. However, 
Diesel fuel is notorious for con
taining lots of unburned hydro
carbons and NOX compounds, 
according to Aptera Motors web
site, and as such, it is difficult to 
get a small diesel engine certified 
for California emissions.
small, efficient, water-cooled gas
oline engine with a closed-loop 
oxygen feedback for the lyp-lh 
model. The result is a clean, quiet 
engine that contributes to the 
vehicles overall efficient design 
and construction. The top speed 
of the Aptera is projected to 
exceed 85 miles per hour, and it 
will go from zero to 60 miles per 
hour in under 10 seconds.
In terms of unique features in 
the car, a rear camera and GPS 
are likely to be standard  the 
former of which is to counter dif
ficulties in rear visibility due to 
the rounded shape of the vehicle. 
Windshield wipers are tucked 
away at the base of the large 
windshield so as to not interrupt 
air flow over the rest of the car 
body.
In terms of driver comfort, heat 
and air conditioning will be avail
able, the windows can be opened, 
and the vehicle comes with cup 
holders and a car charger socket 
for cell phones. Also, the small car 
can fit people up to 6'1" in height, 
or even up to 6'5" with accommo
dating seat adjustments.
The Aptera can be reserved 
for purchase in California on 
the companys website at www. 
aptera.com/reserve.php.
As such, the makers
of the Aptera are using a

transceivers, especially at high 
frequencies.
This will lower the size and 
cost, and also the power con
sumption of electronic devices in 
the future, Leon said.
In the groups design, MEMS is 
used to physically modify the gap 
between the capacitor plates, al
lowing for on-the-fly changing of 
capacitance in the circuit. MEMS 
is a rapidly growing technology 
involving use of what are literally 
micro-machines, which can 
sense and move circuits at the 
microscopic level.
In essence, what were doing 
is an integration of mechanical 
engineering and electrical engi
neering, Jajoo said.
. Current applications of MEMS 
include accelerometers in car air
bag sensors and the movement 
sensors in the Wiimote, the main 
game controller for Nintendos 
Wii console.
The teams design is a step to
ward building high-performance 
circuits of the future, Reinke said. 
These circuits will not only com
bine connectivity of cell phones 
and WiFi; they may also conform 
to upcoming standards such as 
those of software-defined radio 
systems, radio communication 
in which hardware components 
such as filters and amplifiers are 
applied using software.
Submissions for the next stage 
of the competition are due on 
May 15, upon which the submit
ted blueprints will be fabricated 
by Jazz Semiconductor, a sub
sidiary of Jazz Technologies, Inc. 
that designs highly-integrated 
and power-efficient semiconduc
tor devices.
The fabricated devices will 
then be returned to the univer
sity by mid-September, where 
judges will physically test their 
functionalities.
A final report on the actual per
formance of the devices will then 
be submitted by November, to be 
judged for Phase 2 of the compe
tition.
The main challenge is yet to 
come, Jajoo said. Getting things 
to work in simulation is so much 
easier than getting them to work 
on actual silicon.
OLI improves learning methods
Students learn best when they 
already know the basics of a 
given subject, she explained, and 
it is even more beneficial for them 
to study these concepts outside of 
class. Class time could then be 
reserved for learning more ad
vanced topics and the professors 
would not have to go through all 
the basics again. If students study 
the basics online, for example, 
professors can spend class time 
more effectively, covering adr 
vanced topics.
They [online courses] are 
a supplement to the classroom 
learning experience, Casserly 
said.

The original goal of develop

studies have shown that students 
using the OLI courses can learn

Having said that, this interac

Harvard gym should accomodate all students
At the beginning of this semester, 
Harvard University decided to close the 
doors of one of its gyms for six hours a 
week  but only to men. The policy 
was in response to a request by a group 
of female Muslim students on campus, 
who said that it violated their religious 
beliefs to work out in front of men be
cause of the revealing nature of exercise 
clothes and positions.
Although six hours a week may not 
seem like much, the decision has left 
many men and women at Harvard feel
ing angry, and justifiably so. Harvard is 
a secular university, and this policy goes 
past accommodating a religious group; 
instead, it imposes unfair restrictions on 
the men of Harvard, while further offend
ing students of both genders who feel the 
policy clashes with the institutions ideals.
University gyms are resources that 
should be equally available to all stu
dents. Harvards policy inconveniences 
male gym users during the womens-only 
hours, while not providing any 
mens-only hours to at least balance the 
restrictions.
Moreover, Harvards newwomens-only 
gym hours are underutilized by the stu
dents they are meant to accommodate; 
in a March 21 article, The New York 
Times reported a typical turnout of 
about 15 people during peak gym hours. 
A March 4 article on CNN.com told of 
an Associated Press reporter standing 
outside of the restricted gym during the 
womens-only hours without seeing a 
single student enter.
Harvard is in a unique position as one 
of the countrys leading universities,
and as such its policies influence the 
academic community at large. Although 
Harvard isnt the only university with 
gender-based gym restrictions, it is the 
most prominent, and were concerned 
with the imbalance in the precedent set 
by the policy.
Despite our frustrations with the re
stricted hours, we cannot condemn Har
vards efforts to listen to its students. 
Administrators will evaluate the gym 
policy at the end of the academic year, 
and we hope that Harvard will continue 
to respect student opinions during this 
review. Ideally, the school should listen 
to both the female students in favor of 
this policy as well as students against it, 
and perhaps adjust the policy, either by 
adding mens-only hours or eliminating 
gender restrictions altogether.
The Iraq war has gone on for too long
Five years later, we are still at war.
March 19 marked the fifth anniver
sary of the United States military in
volvement in Iraq.
Since going to war in early 2003, sup
port for the war has waned, and the pro
tests of young Americans  Carnegie 
Mellon students included  have been 
increasingly ignored.
With an approval rating of a mere 34 
percent, President Bush pushes onward 
in Iraq, where, apart from a rising death 
toll of American troops, Iraqi civilians 
are unfairly wounded and killed. In fact, 
as presidential hopeful Barack Obama 
noted in a speech given in Oakland last 
Friday, there have been more civilian 
casualties in Iraq than in the Civil War, 
World War I, or World War II.
This marker of the fifth anniversary 
of the war roughly coincides with the
amount of American troops lost reach
ing 4000, which occurred last Monday.
The Iraq war has gone on for too long. 
Too many young Americans have died, 
and for dishonest reasons on the part 
of our nations administration. If were 
fighting for oil, President Bush and his 
administration should say so honestly
 and then make an exit strategy and 
pull our soldiers out of Iraq.
A counterargument to withdrawing is 
that doing so might put soldiers deaths  
and the billions of dollars spent on the war
 in vain. Moreover, this would happen 
while not protecting Americans from ter
rorism, as originally promised. However, 
the resources going toward the war could 
instead be used to solve problems on our 
own soil  especially since its unlikely 
that we are able to establish democracy in 
Iraq in just five, or even 10, years.
This harrowed anniversary does in
deed have a bearing on the upcoming 
primary and presidential elections. 
While we will not tell you explicitly who 
to vote for  we want students to make 
their own informed, individual deci
sions on the candidates lined up for the 
2008 election  we hope that whoever 
is elected makes decisions that repre
sent the views of the American people. 
If a large majority of Americans (includ
ing ourselves) appear to be against con
tinuing this war  and not in support of 
the leader who initiated it  then we as 
a country should no longer sacrifice our 
young men and women, and should in
stead end a war based more on the econ
omy than on principles of democracy.
When does the voice of the American 
people become more important than the 
salvaging of a politicians ego?
Evaluate JFC budgets for funding consistency
Within a week, the 2008-09 budgets 
for Carnegie Mellon clubs and organiza
tions will be released by the Joint Fund
ing Committee (JFC). The JFC is a group 
of Undergraduate Student Senators and 
Graduate Student Assembly representa
tives, tasked with allocating nearly $1 
million of Student Activities Fee funds 
out to officially recognized groups.
But this year, amid discussion of push
ing for an increase in the Student Activi
ties Fee to support the large number of 
new student groups that have started 
receiving funding in recent years (see 
the Feb. 25 editorial board article, Stu
dent Activities Fee must be managed ef
ficiently), the JFC has within the past
two years decided to open funding more 
broadly to include religious groups.
This is a reversal of funding decisions 
made by the JFC in the past, where spe
cifically religious groups were not eli
gible for funding due to a clause in the 
JFCs bylaws stating events which are 
academic, political, and/or religious in 
nature will not be funded. However, as 
religious groups do enrich the campus 
community by holding events open to 
the entire student body, not just people 
of their faith, these groups are receiv
ing funding. Whether or not religious 
groups of this nature should be given 
funding is up for debate; however, it is 
questionable as to why this change in
policy has been so seemingly under the 
radar.
While we do not believe it is our posi
tion to attempt to draw the line between 
cultural groups that have received fund
ing and religious groups that historically 
have not, we believe it is important to 
make students aware that these changes 
have occurred.
When budgets are released next week 
we encourage you to look at the funding 
given to all of the groups across campus 
to evaluate whether your activities fee is 
going to the right places, as this is your 
activities fee being used in a way that 
should benefit both you and the campus 
as a whole.

Questioning the effectiveness 
of antidepressants
ric and otherwise, that it becomes nearly
CECILIA WESTBROOK
About a month ago, a spate of news 
articles popped up with the bold head
line Prozac doesnt work, written in 
response to a scholarly article from 
earlier this year that throws doubt on 
the efficacy of a class of antidepressant 
medications (the selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs), of which 
Prozac is a member. Aside from the 
newspaper and magazine responses, 
the articles findings set off a rash of 
posts in the blogosphere and an impas
sioned, if quiet, debate.
The article in question took the form 
of a large review, or meta-analysis, of all 
of the available studies conducted to test 
the efficacy of SSRIs such as Prozac and 
Effexor, including some analyses that 
were not published by the drug compa
nies that conducted them. This articles 
analysis was groundbreaking in that it is 
the largest meta-analysis of its kind ever 
done for SSRI studies. After pooling all 
of the data and comparing the efficacies 
found between studies, the authors con
cluded that all but the most severely de
pressed patients given the drugs did not 
show significant reductions in their de
pressive symptoms compared to those 
given placebos.
Of course, anybody who regularly 
reads science reporting in newspapers 
or weblogs knows better than to take a 
statement as unambiguous as Prozac 
doesnt work without a grain or two of 
salt. Mainstream scientific articles are 
filtered through numerous rounds of 
editing, summarizing, and interpreting 
in order to be squeezed into a digestible 
pill the average reader can swallow. Al
though this conciseness is the beauty 
of journalism, it means that by neces
sity much of the complexity  and the 
subtlety  of the data has been lost. Af
ter all, 40 million people have been pre
scribed Prozac, and I bet a lot of them 
would be surprised to hear anybody tell 
them it doesnt work at all.
The proviso here is that controlled 
medication studies for psychiatric ill
nesses are very, very difficult to con
duct. Theoretically, youd want to have 
a group of depressed people and then 
another, non-depressed control group, 
but in reality, constructing pure sam
ples is near impossible.
For one, people who volunteer for 
medication research studies tend to be 
in lower socio-economic brackets, and 
tend to comprise the same population 
that suffers from numerous mental 
illnesses. These conditions should ex
clude a number of volunteer patients, 
but here we encounter the second big 
problem  screening volunteers relies 
upon the diagnostic interview. That is, 
you have to ask a volunteer about his or 
her symptoms and trust that he or she is 
telling you the truth, notwithstanding 
the (sometimes significant) amount of 
money youre implicitly offering him or 
her for enrolling in your study. So, many 
research subjects lie, meaning that most 
control groups in these experiments 
are anything but  and researchers 
have no way of knowing.
And finally, depression so frequently 
co-occurs with other illnesses, psychiatimpossible to have a pure depression 
group  and such other illnesses can 
significantly impact patients responses 
to psychiatric medication, thus obfus
cating the results of the study.
Given the difficulties inherent in put
ting together a subject population, it 
becomes clear that the subjects easiest 
to cast are the ones depressed to the 
exclusion of anything else  meaning, 
most likely, the subset comprised of the 
most severely depressed. And this is, 
coincidentally, the group that the study 
authors found showed the greatest re
sponse to medication. Coincidence?
All that said, this was still a ground
breaking study. Its conclusions convey 
a surprising message contrary to the 
conventional wisdom prevalent among 
research scientists, psychiatrists, and 
general practitioners (GPs) everywhere. 
Further, it underscores a misunder
standing of mental illness that is preva
lent in society and rooted in an out-ofdate scientific viewpoint.
For a few decades, the prevalent view 
of depression among scientists was 
something called the neurotransmitter 
hypothesis, which held that the disease 
was caused by low levels of serotonin 
and related neurotransmitters. This is 
where the oft-cited chemical imbal
ance idea came from. But a large body 
of research has changed this view; now
adays, depression is seen as a more com
plex process involving social, cognitive, 
and biological processes in conjunction. 
This is borne out by data showing that, 
for many depressed patients, the right 
kind of therapy is just as effective as 
medication, if not more so. Further, 
many depressed patients dont respond 
to medicinal therapy at all, and others 
respond while on the medication but re
lapse as soon as theyre off of it again.
Inasmuch as the biological aspect of 
depression involves the serotonin sys
tem in the brain, SSRIs are a great treat
ment, particularly when combined with 
other forms of therapy. Antidepressants 
can throw a kink in the downward 
spiral of depression, giving a person 
the opportunity to realign their think
ing and get themselves back on track. 
But these days, perhaps encouraged by 
pharmaceutical companies or maybe 
just a cultural lock in our thinking, GPs 
and psychiatrists prescribe antidepres
sants with impunity, thus ignoring all of 
the other aspects of the disease  a per
sons relationships, life events, thoughts 
and feelings  all of the things that 
make them a person. This exemplifies 
the American obsession with throwing 
quick fixes at problems.
SSRIs might not be a great treatment 
option for people who are not severely 
depressed. For those people, lifestyle 
changes, cognitive-behavioral therapy, 
and other psychosocial adjustments are 
more effective and cheaper than pills. 
Just like there is no pill to cure obesity, 
there is no pill to cure depression. Phar
maceutical companies, and the Ameri
can government, would be better off 
investing in research on psychotherapy.

Celebrate domesticity
rwutn.u rotobop
With Carnival less than three 
weeks away, life is getting a lit
tle crazy. However, as every day 
brings us closer to that eventful 
April weekend, I am reminded of 
one thing: Women are badass.
Every day, Carnegie Mellon 
women risk their lives to drive 
buggies, and sacrifice their 
beauty sleep to build booths and 
organize Greek Sing. Forget the 
traditional triple threat of sing
ing-acting-dancing  Carnegie 
Mellon women can sing, act, 
dance, write, build, paint, mass 
balance, write code, play sports, 
draw, and integrate. This leaves 
the question, When do I have 
time for my life?
This question is not a new one. 
Women have been pushed to 
their limits for centuries. How
ever the relevance of domestic
ity has evolved, its just as impor
tant now as in the past.
As little as 20 years ago, all 
women were expected to be do
mestic, no matter their career 
path. A woman could be on the 
road to being a CEO, but she still 
knew how to take care of a family
 and that she was expected to 
do so. Now, domesticity has taken 
a backseat to everything else we 
women get ourselves into.
Sure, theres nothing wrong 
with having a career. I have two 
majors in CIT and hope to go to 
grad school and work in a medi
cal device company. However, 
I learned to cook, clean, sew, 
and do laundry at age seven. Im 
surprised by the number of girls 
Ive met who are over 20 and can 
barely take care of themselves.
Many will argue that being 
domestic shouldnt be a priority 
for most women in their twen
ties today. With all the pressures 
of school, activities, sports, and 
life in general, who has time to 
be domestic? Some traditionally 
domestic skills are now consid
ered somewhat archaic, like sew
ing: Why does any woman need 
to sew when she can buy clothes 
at a low cost? Regardless, Im ap
palled to meet girls who cant at 
least sew on a button.
When Carnegie Mellon was 
first founded, it was a technical 
school for the sons of Andrew 
Carnegies steel workers to get a 
good, affordable education. He 
later started the Margaret Morri
son Carnegie Institute as a voca
tional school for women. Imagine 
that: Once upon a time, women 
went to school to virtually learn 
to be good housewives. Back 
then, it was ridiculous for a 
woman to not know how to be 
domestic, but today people get 
offended to hear that women 
ever went to school to be good 
housewives. The inscription on 
Margaret Morrison reads, To 
make and inspire the home; to 
lessen the suffering and increase 
happiness; to aid mankind in its 
upward struggles; to ennoble 
and adorn lifes work, however 
humble, these are womens high 
prerogatives. I suspect that 
at the time it was written, this 
statement meant that a womens 
job is to aid mankind by taking 
care of the home  and I agree 
this is important, even today.
So where do our priorities lie? 
Women have proven to be more 
than competent in the work 
place, in the classroom, and any
where else that they want to be; 
they can do anything that men 
can. But what have we sacrificed 
in the process?

All should pay attention to the war
luiedsW lniidhop
Last week, after five years 
of conflict, the number of 
American casualties in Iraq 
reached 4000, as reported by 
The New York Times. Without a 
doubt, this news is tragic. Each 
soldiers death reminds us of 
the waste and destruction that 
human beings unleash on each 
other in times of war and con
flict.
However, the most upset
ting element to this bloody 
landmark is that it caught so 
many Americans by surprise. At 
this time last year, the death toll 
of American soldiers was near
ing 3500, and President Bush 
was beginning. to talk about 
a troop surge. It had been the 
bloodiest year of the war yet, 
and over 50 percent of Ameri
cans knew what the casualty 
count looked like, according 
to an ongoing study conducted 
at the Pew Center. This year, 
only 28 percent of Americans 
reportedly saw the 4000 mark 
approaching.
The fact that our young men 
and women are dying for this 
war is clearly grievous. Even 
a spokeswoman for President 
Bush said, regarding the death 
toll reaching 4000, The presi
dent feels each and every one 
of the deaths very strongly and 
he grieves for their families, 
according to the Times article. 
But beyond this is the fact 
that Americans are not paying 
enough attention, as a whole, to 
the war.
Moreover, the war has had 
more consequences than 
just that of a high number of 
American soldiers deaths. This 
4000-casualty figure does not
even include the huge number 
of Iraqi civilian casualties of 
the war, or even the economic 
burden that the war has placed on 
individual Americans. Since the 
American invasion of Iraq began, 
there have been approximately
151,000 Iraqi civilian casualties, 
according to reports by the BBC. 
That is approximately 30,000 
casualties per year, which is 
a frighteningly large number. 
These deaths, too, are tragic, 
and theyre underrepresented in 
the American discussion of the 
war.
The American people were 
handed a war on September
11, 2001, when 2948 people 
were killed in a single day on 
our soil. Maybe the invasion of 
Iraq was a mistake, but the at
tacks of 9/11 called for strong 
action in response. Just imagine 
how our world and our country 
specifically would be different 
today if the United States had not 
entered World War II after the 
Japanese killed 2403 Americans 
in a single day at Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii. Regardless of whether 
or not the initial reasons for the 
Iraq invasion were just, it is the 
American citizens responsibility 
now to acknowledge the issues 
at hand and stay current with 
information on the war.
All things considered, U.S. 
soldiers in Iraq appear to be doing 
a pretty good job of taking care of 
themselves and their buddies, at 
least. The rate at which soldiers 
die in Iraq is surprisingly close 
to the rates at which soldiers die 
due to accidents during peace
time. In fact, the annual military 
death toll, which has hovered 
around 1800, is lower than sev
eral peacetime years in the early 
1980s, according to a report from 
Congress released last summer. 
However, the fact remains that 
4000 American soldiers have 
died since the invasion started,
and we as a nation arent recog
nizing that fact enough.
Last year, Americans were 
frustrated with the war in 
which we are all now involved; 
many Americans were angry 
at President Bush for refusing 
to use diplomacy and for 
misrepresenting the risks we 
faced. But now, most of us seem 
to just not care anymore; at least, 
we dont seem to care enough to 
acknowledge the plights of our 
own soldiers.
We are a country in denial. 
Our parents told us that they 
dealt with war so that we would 
not have to. Their parents told 
them the same thing. We may 
again someday fail to prevent an 
attack.
Our countrys soldiers have 
the most difficult job of any 
American. Not only is being 
a soldier one of the deadliest 
occupations, but death sur
rounds these people. They go 
out there every day just trying to 
survive, and they watch people
 their friends, their enemies, 
and innocent civilians, too  die 
around them. By assuming such 
strife, soldiers allow us to forget 
about our losses, and ignore the 
suffering in other places.
Whether you support the 
troops and want them to keep 
fighting,, or support the troops 
and want them to come home, 
the very least each of us can do 
is to pay attention to what is 
going on in the Iraq war in any 
way we can. It is impossible to 
better this situation if we simply 
close our eyes and point our fin
gers. The only way to help bring 
American soldiers home  and 
avoid another 4000 being lost  
is to listen to what others need.

Thank you for not asking us about smoking
rueuw boydp
The most thorough evaluation 
of Carnegie Mellon student opin
ions about smoking in recentyears 
was a 2007 survey administered 
by Student Senate. Participants 
were polled in several areas, in 
addition to answering the overall 
question: Should we ban smoking 
at Carnegie Mellon?
Of the surveys results, two 
pieces of data pique my interest.
First, more students (45 per
cent of voters) were in favor of 
pulling tobacco from Entropy 
than against (35 percent). Since 
Carnegie Mellon did pull ciga
rettes from Entropy in early 2007, 
it would seem that the admin
istration is doing a good job of 
listening to students.
However, most students even 
loosely in the loop as the admin
istration made plans for Entropys 
change know that the plan to 
remove tobacco products was 
independent of the survey. What 
if we had voted against removing 
cigarettes from Entropy? Would it 
have mattered?
This might seem pointless, 
since it turns out the adminis
trations actions did agree with 
student opinions, but it matters 
to me. I think its important that 
student opinions are represented
by effort, not coincidence.
My second point of interest in 
the survey is that 52 percent of 
students surveyed voted against a 
campus-wide smoking ban, while 
38 percent were in favor of it.
With so many students against 
a smoking ban, it seems ridiculous 
that members of the administra
tion continue to talk about it. 
Im not saying a smoking ban 
will never happen, or even that 
it would be the worst thing in 
the world, although I think it is 
unacceptable to push for a policy 
that 52 percent of students are 
against.
Thus, smoking ban enthusiasts, 
I put forth to you a challenge: 
Convince me.
Give me information that 
shows that even short-term expo
sure to secondhand smoking (i.e., 
standing outside of Baker Hall) is 
dangerous. Ive read competing 
arguments, and would like to see 
more swaying evidence before I 
believe that our current campus 
arrangement poses a threat to 
non-smokers health.
Furthermore, tell me what 
other colleges are doing and how 
students there have reacted.
Carnegie Mellon  as Dennis 
Quaid and Sarah Jessica Parker 
would attest  is full of smart 
people. If the argument for a 
smoking ban is valid, Im sure 
50-plus percent of students, once 
educated, should agree to it. If 
you cant convince us, that prob
ably says something about the 
idea. In my opinion, it is the bur
den of those in favor of new legis
lation to convince us little people 
that this is what we need.
Currently, the more pertinent 
campus smoking issue concerns 
an increase in smoking restric
tions. As reported last week in 
The Tartan, the Healthy Campus 
2010 Task Force is pushing to get
rid of the 20-feet rule in favor 
of distinct you-can-smoke-here 
areas on campus.
Before we do this, I think 
Carnegie Mellon should work on 
enforcing the policies we already 
have. And Im not alone; 62 per
cent of students surveyed said 
students breaking the 20-feet 
rule should be fined.
As for the proposed switch
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
to restricted-smoking areas, it 
seems the best next step would 
be to take a new student survey 
with questions specific to the

Hey Carnegie Mellon,
Hopefully everyones Carnival 
preparations are coming along 
well! I understand that the 
weather and road conditions 
have acted as a pretty terrible 
twosome inhibiting Buggy rolls. 
I want to recognize Sweepstakes 
Chairman Mizel Djukic and his 
committee for the tremendous 
work theyve been doing in ap
pealing to our administration 
and local government to get the 
roads fixed. Perhaps well see the 
perennial competitors posting 
even faster times this year! 
Cheers to Booth as well  Im 
sure well read all about them!
Last week, as usual, was an in
teresting one for Adi and myself. 
We discussed the end of our term 
and planned out the legwork for 
our remaining initiatives. Our 
entire focal point this year was to 
establish sustainable programs 
that didnt depend on different 
student body presidents voli
tions to continue their predeces
sors work..We aimed to team 
up with organizations, some of 
which you may have never heard 
of, and others like SDC, a house
hold name, to create long-lasting 
benefits for the student body.
This week, we worked to plan 
out the course of the digital Insti
tutional Memory add-on to Org 
Tracker ([stugov.andrew.cmu.
edu/orgtracker). To refresh, Org 
Tracker will soon contain a sec
tion where organization leaders 
can post internal knowledge that 
they accrue over their individual 
terms to pass it on, in written 
form, to their successors for years 
to come. That way, as leadership 
quality fluctuates in an organiza
tion, knowledge will still remain. 
Luckily, the Committee on Stu
dent Organizations (CoSO) has 
been gracious enough to work 
with us and incorporate Institu
tional Memory into its bylaws as 
a part of the re-recognition pro
cess. We met with CoSO Presi
dent Phil Croul and members 
Mana Amerie and Dorian Adeyemi earlier last week to iron 
out some details, and should 
have a final understanding later 
this week.
Also on our plate is the Fiesta 
de Primavera. Adi and I had been 
hoping to create a new tradition 
to celebrate the end of the year, 
but found that there was already 
one in place (just one slightly less 
hyped than wed hoped). With 
that said, let the hype begin! Fi
esta de Primavera is set for the 
last day of classes, May 2. More 
details will be available as we get 
further into the process!
Its your turn to replace Adi, 
Joel, and myself. Elections will 
be April 6 through 9 at elections. 
andrew.cmu.edu, so read the 
platforms available there, and 
VOTE... or die... not really, just 
kidding!
Tomorrow is April Fools Day. So we asked,A PERSONS OPINION

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Money vs. education at the collegiate athletic level
CASEY GARTH
On March 19, thousands of 
Americans turned on their tele
visions and eagerly awaited the 
answer to the question: Where 
would the number-one high 
school football recruit in the na
tion, Terrelle Pryor, commit? As 
he unzipped his jacket and re
vealed that he will join the Ohio 
State Buckeyes, the students and 
alumni at Ohio State celebrated; 
they knew they were in for an ex
citing college football season.
For a few Division I recruits, 
the colleges they choose affect 
not only themselves and their 
families, but also the nation. 
However, other Division I, II, and 
III athletes recruited around the 
nation do not receive the same 
hype, and yet, smaller schools 
still have difficulty competing 
for these top-notch athletes.
Recruiting is all about sales
manship and how good of a deal 
you can offer your client. At the 
Division I level, top recruits are 
treated like celebrities. An offi
cial visit consists of more than an 
overnight stay in a dorm and a 
tour of campus. The coaches and 
players are selling the school, the 
location, the environment, the 
social life, and the education.
The recruits are persuaded 
by top-of-the-line gear, per
fectly maintained facilities, and 
the fan base, so it might seem 
strange that there are still Divi
sion I-level players at Division
III schools. It is not strictly the 
education that brings quality 
athletes to Division III schools 
like Carnegie Mellon; it is the 
package deal. Carnegie Mellon is 
a member of the University Ath
letic Association (UAA), which 
is a conference that prides itself 
on providing Division I athletics
with a Division III education.
Students at schools like Car
negie Mellon, Washington Uni
versity in St. Louis, and the 
University of Chicago take pride 
in their abilities in the classroom 
and on the field, and this balance 
sells the school. Carnegie Mellon 
is recognized nationally because 
of academics, not athletics, but 
for many high school students, 
athletics can be a deciding factor 
in choosing to attend.
We have the ability to get 
Division I-quality recruits be
cause they are here for academ
ics, and the competitive athletics 
are the icing on the cake, said 
assistant womens soccer coach 
Betsy Warren.
The most difficult aspect of 
recruiting high-caliber players 
at the Division III level is the lack 
of athletic scholarships. Fullyfunded Division I schools have 
14 full-ride scholarships they
can distribute to athletes, while 
the NCAA prohibits Division III 
athletic departments from pro
viding scholarships.
While athletic scholarship are 
off limits, scholar-athletes in the 
UAA receive a comparable ex
perience to Division I athletes 
while in the program. The ath
letic funding for schools in the 
UAA allows for high-end equip
ment and facilities, along with 
the ability to travel by jet to com
pete. By providing funding to 
the athletic department, scholarathletes can have the athletic 
experience of a Division I athlete 
and the academic experience of 
a Division III student.
While schools like Carnegie 
Mellon will probably never have 
athletes like Terrelle Pryor, the 
Division III name should not 
deter Division I-caliber athletes 
from competing at a Division III 
level.

with a 33-22 loss, but rebound
ed quickly and took revenge on 
the Panthers in a 14-13 victory 
March 22.
Sam Clanton, the Tartans 
coach, is a robotics graduate stu
dent working to mold the raw 
talent on the team, led by cap
tain Walter King. The team is 
composed of many athletes who 
have not played rugby before, 
although a number of them are 
former Carnegie Mellon football 
players. The players practice for 
two hours twice a week in hopes 
of turning their athleticism into 
rugby talent.
While the skills are similar 
between football and rugby, the 
rules and regulations are not the 
same, which can sometimes pose 
difficulties. The skill set from 
football transfers to rugby very 
well. The mentality and physicality of football make the transition 
much easier, said former Tartan 
running back Robert Gimson, 
also a new member of the rugby 
team. However, it is difficult to 
learn the rules and tackling is dif
ferent, so adapting to new rules 
can be difficult for newcomers.
Even with many new players, 
the team has a strong core of 
experienced leaders.
While the Tartans are not yet a 
member of the Allegheny Rugby 
Union, after defeating University 
of Pittsburgh, they were placed 
in the Division II bracket at the 
Coopers Lake tournament this 
past Saturday.
The Tartan's were defeated 
by Franciscan University 14-8 
in their first game but rallied 
in their next, defeating Niagara 
University 12-7.

the first time Denison served for 
the match at 7-2, but when Deni
son next served for the match at
7-5, the Tartans were unable to 
break the Denison serve again.
In singles, however, the Tar
tans roared back, taking the 
match 6-3. MacTaggart got his 
serve under control and won his 
singles match 6-4, 6-3.
I looked at that singles match 
as essentially a chance to redeem 
myself for my poor doubles per
formance, MacTaggart said. I 
also fall back on the fact that I 
have always been a better singles 
player. The coaching also helps as 
far as Coach gave us the sole goal 
of playing with positive energy 
and fire in our bellies. He gave us 
this goal in-between doubles and 
singles because he saw that dur
ing doubles we were lethargic. 
The mens record now stands 
at 12-4.
The men travel to Virginia next 
Friday to play University of Mary 
Washington. The women play at

other away from the ball while 
trying to kick the ball and hook 
it back toward their teammates 
behind them.
Similar to football, passing and 
tackling are important parts of a 
rugby game; however, they vary 
from the traditional concepts. 
In rugby, no forward passes are 
allowed; the ball must either be 
run for a gain or passed back
wards. In addition, when tackling 
a player on an opposing team, the 
defender must maintain contact 
with the player, and tackling can
not occur above the midsection.
This season, the Carnegie 
Mellon club rugby team has a 
record of 1-1 in the two matches it 
has played against the University 
of Pittsburghs Division I club 
team.
In the players first game of the
Clarion University at, the end 
of regulation, but the team was 
defeated with a field goal in the

events. In the 1500-meter run, 
senior Drew Miller came in first 
with a time of 4:04.08. Behind 
Miller, first-year Erik Kallenbach finished eighth with a time 
of 4:12.97. Sophomore Dario 
Donatelli finished first in the 
10,000-meter run with a time 
of 31:41.9. First-year J.P. Allera 
(32:03.5) and junior Mike Con
don (33:42.3) placed second and 
eighth, respectively. Junior Ryan 
Anderson finished second in the 
3000-meter run with a time of 
9:38.51.
Im pretty satisfied with my 
time, Anderson said. Im about 
20 seconds ahead of where Ive 
started the last two seasons, de
spite feeling pretty out of shape, 
so I expect good things to come.
In the pole vault, sophomore 
Chris Bridgman (4.42 meters) 
and first-year Jin Ho Baek (3.81 
meters) took first and fifth, re
spectively. Senior Mike Reg
gie led the team in the hammer 
throw with 47.02 meters, while 
junior Chris Fornataro took sev
enth in the discus throw with 
40.57 meters. In the relays, the 
mens team took third in the 
4xl00-meter and first in the 
4x800-meter with times of 43.69 
and 8:00.82, respectively.
For the womens team, firstyear Courtney Baker (1:00.69) 
continued her indoor season 
success with a third-place finish 
in the 400-meter dash. Sopho
more Crystal Lee Pow took ninth 
in the 400-meter hurdles with a 
time of 1:11.24.
In the 800-meter run, se
nior Ashley Bakelmun led the 
team with a third-place finish at 
2:24.44. Sophomore Diane Mat
tingly (2:27.84) and first-year 
Laura McKee (2:28.18) came in 
sixth and seventh, respectively. 
The always-reliable 4x400-meter 
relay team (4:11.11) wrapped up 
a successful meet with a secondplace finish.
Its been a while since Ive had 
a good race, so running well in 
the opening meet will certainly 
help my confidence going into 
the season, Bakelmun said.
Junior Chrissy Krutz finished 
fourth in the 1000-meter run 
with a time of 42.49. Fellow ju
nior Sami Simmons jumped for 
10.97 meters to take second in 
the triple jump. Overall, I think 
the team had some great perfor
mances, Krutz said. We hung 
in with the Division I teams at 
the meet, and we did very well 
against the Division III competi
tion.
Next weekend, the track 
and field teams will travel to

Mens tennis defeats Denison University 6-3

Fans of the Carnegie Mellon 
tennis teams were finally able to 
watch the kind of tennis that has 
propelled the womens and mens 
teams to rankings of seventh and 
13th, respectively. On Tuesday 
at home, the women were out
gunned by Division I University of 
Pittsburgh 8-1, but the next day, 
the men rebounded from a slow 
start to defeat Denison University 
6-3.
On a chilly, windy Tuesday at 
the campus tennis courts, the 
womens team took on Pitt. The 
women ended on the opposite side 
of an 8-1 rout, something they 
would usually inflict on oppo
nents. Still, the first-year pairing 
of Kelly Hart and Ashley Herrick 
won their doubles match 8-5.
Senior Amy Staloch and firstyear Jennifer Chui put up the 
strongest fights in singles. Staloch 
used her counterpunching ability 
to frustrate Pitt player Kristy 
Borza. Staloch held on as long as 
she could, succumbing 6-2, 7-5, 
unable to get to a tiebreaker.
Chui, standing well inside the 
court, used her power to dic
tate play, moving Pitt opponent 
Sabrina Visram side to side be
fore getting the open court. Chui 
seemed to want to get to the net 
to steal time from her opponent 
and finish points more easily, but 
she often got caught up by deep 
slices from Visram, whose consis
tent ability to retrieve Chuis shots 
proved the deciding factor in the 
match, which Visram won 6-1,
5-7,1-0 (10-5).
In tiebreakers, I get nervous, 
Chui said, so I try to hit through 
the ball and play my game. Either 
that or just close my eyes and hope 
that it goes in.
The womens record now stands 
at 11-4.
On Wednesday, the 13th-ranked 
mens team took on Denison 
University. In the three doubles 
matches, which were played first, 
the Denison coach seemed to have 
all of the answers to the Tartans 
on his novelty clipboard shaped 
like a green tennis court; Denison 
won two of the three matches.
In one of the matches, first-year 
Bobby MacTaggart partnered with 
sophomore James Muliawan in an
8-5 defeat. MacTaggart struggled 
with his serve and even launched 
one over the fence, sending him 
and Muliawan into a 7-2 hole 
early. The two staved off defeat

finish eighth with 42 points. On 
the womens side, Saint Francis 
University took first with 157 
points.
After his National Division III 
finals appearance, senior Eric 
Tang returned to the track with 
a strong performance. He took 
fourth place in the 100-meter 
dash with 11.48 and second place 
in the triple jump with 13.26 
meters. First-year Essien Ohues 
finished third in the triple jump 
(13.17 meters) and second in the
high jump (1.95 meters). In the, 
200-meter dash, first-year Casey 
Piper (22.97) and sophomore

Tartans continue Scottish tradition by playing rugby
surn. yueiw
Junior Staffwriter
After its 1871 debutwithamatch 
between Scotiand and England, 
the sport of rugby has finally 
made its way to Carnegie Mellon, 
where students are continuing 
the tradition and representing the 
universitys Tartan heritage. With 
its roots in England, Scotland, 
and New Zealand, rugby is still a 
relatively unknown sport in the 
United States, but is rapidly gain
ing popularity.
Rugby is a combination of two 
familiar sports: soccer and foot
ball. The game is played on a 
grassy area similar to the size of a 
soccer field at 80 yards wide and 
120 yards long, with scoring simi
lar to that of football. A try, which 
is like a touchdown, is worth five 
points and a conversion kick is 
worth two points. A dropped goal, 
like a field goal, can be kicked for 
three points.
The match starts with a kickoff 
and 15 players on the field for 
each team: eight forwards and 
seven backs. Where the game gets 
complex is when the ball goes 
out of bounds or after a penalty. 
When the ball is out of bounds, a 
line-out occurs in which one team 
throws the ball inbounds to a 
team member who is hoisted into 
the air. After a penalty,1 a scrum 
occurs and the eight forwards for 
each team attempt to push each

The 3-on-3 basketball season 
provides teams that fared well 
during the regular 5-on-5 season 
a second chance to win a cham
pionship. The 3-on-3 games are 
significantly less tiring since they 
are only played to 11 points in 
the regular season and 15 after 
the semifinals.
In the Minors league, the final
game featured the Beta LeBrons 
in pursuit of another champi
onship victory following their 
Minors 5-on-5 win. This time, 
however, they faced off against 
a tough SAE team. Once again, 
first-year Richard Pattison con
tributed significantly to the of
fensive production of the Beta 
team, but unlike the previous 
championship game, this one did 
not end in the teams favor. With 
the help of sophomore Dan Hudock, SAE managed to hold Beta 
off long enough to eventually 
gain a 17-15 victory.
The Majors-Intermediate final 
continued the trend of exciting 
finishes with a matchup between
Majors basketball champions 
Beta Something and the recon
structed Intermediate champi
ons, ACF. Beta Something rolled 
through their 3-on-3 season be
hind junior Derek Wisnieskis 
ability to produce offense in the 
paint. Unfortunately for Beta, 
he was not available for the final 
game. Despite considerable ef
fort to finish with another bas
ketball victory, Beta Something 
was unable to respond to ACFs 
chemistry. Junior Dan Martin 
made his presence known un
derneath the basket to control 
the pace of the game. Combined 
with the speed of ACF junior Ji 
Wu, they emerged with the win
15-11 over Beta Something.
The Team Friggin Awesome 
teams 1 and 2 shared their ros
ters and therefore were unable to 
compete against one other in the 
championship. As a result, Team 
Friggin Awesome 2 forfeited and 
passed off the womens bracket 
championship to team 1.
MRU managed to take first 
place in fouland three-point 
shooting competitions.
' In the three-point competi
tion, senior Amrut Pati scored 15 
out of 25 in the first round and 16 
out of 25 in the second, to take the 
title. Sophomore Vinith Annam 
made 88 out of 100 free throws 
to take the foul-shooting title.

Making the All-Tournament 
Team at the Grenelefe Webber 
International Tournament over 
spring break, senior Howard 
Smith attributes much of his 
lifestyle to the game of golf, 
one of the few varsity sports 
that spans both semesters. 
Smith discussed his senti
ments regarding his academic 
and athletic experiences at 
Carnegie Mellon as his Tartan 
career comes to a close.
The Tartan: When did you 
first start playing golf?
Smith: As a kid growing 
up in San Diego, I played a 
lot of competitive baseball. 
When I was between 8 and 11 
years old, I played in numer
ous baseball tournaments all 
over the country. During those 
years, my brother and I would 
often go play on a local parthree golf course, even though 
we really had no idea what we 
were doing. When I was about
12 years old, a local municipal 
golf course opened up right 
near my house, and I became 
obsessed with golf. From that 
point on, my friends and I were 
at the course on most days, and 
that is when my game began 
to really improve. I ultimately 
began playing in a lot of golf 
tournaments, and then, when 
my family moved to La$ Vegas 
before high school, there were 
ample opportunities to play 
there as well.
T: Are you .involved with 
other organizations or activi
ties at Carnegie Mellon?
S: I have participated in 
many sports-related activities 
here at CMU. I am the sports 
director for CMUs campus 
radio station, WRCT. I have 
helped broadcast most of the 
schools varsity football and 
basketball games over the last 
three years, including going 
on many of the teams away 
trips. I am also involved with 
intramural athletics as an of
ficial. I am currently interning 
at ESPN Radio 1250 as well.
T: What has been your fa
vorite golf course to play? If 
you could have a course of 
your own, where would it be?
S: My favorite course that 
Ive played was definitely 
Pebble Beach Golf Links in 
California. As my high school 
graduation present, my dad 
and my friends dad took us 
there to play. Every diehard 
golfer should make it a point 
to golf at Pebble Beach at least 
once in their life. As far as hav
ing a course of my own, how 
about Augusta National, where 
the Masters Tournament is an
nually played? I might need to 
pull a few strings to get access 
to that place, though!
T: Do you see yourself mak
ing time to play golf while you 
have a career?
S: I will try to, but I defi
nitely wont have as much time 
to devote to it as I do at school.
Name:
Howard Smith 
Age:
22
Major/School:
Business
Administration/Tepper
Hometown:
Las Vegas, Nev.
Sport:
Golf
Golf is such a great sport for 
many reasons, one of which is 
that it is a lifetime sport. I will 
definitely enjoy playing week
end rounds with my friends 
down the road and compet
ing in some amateur tourna
ments.
T: Has being on the golf 
team had an impact on your 
academic life at Carnegie 
Mellon?
S: Absolutely. When we are 
in-season, we are usually play
ing tournaments three or four 
days a week for several straight 
weeks. I think it would be dif
ficult to balance school and 
golf if you didnt learn how to 
manage your time really well. I 
think I have gotten pretty good 
at this because of golf.
T: How do you feel about 
your academic experiences 
here? How do you plan to use 
your education in the future?
S: I have loved every mo
ment of the academics, just 
like every CMU student! In all 
, seriousness, there are classes 
that I have really enjoyed, 
while there have been others 
that I really couldnt say that 
[about]. But overall, it has 
been a good experience, one 
that will definitely be benefi
cial for the rest of my life. As 
for my future plans, I want 
to ultimately do something in 
sports, perhaps college athlet
ics. Next year, I have a job 
with the NCAA at their head
quarters in Indianapolis. It is a 
one-year program where they 
hire about 15 or 20 college 
graduates each year. Well see 
where that takes me down the 
road.
T: If you could be a cartoon 
character, who would you be 
and why?
S: Tough question. I would 
say Inspector Gadget. That 
guy is amazing with all his 
gadgets, and he always finds 
a way to bail himself out of 
trouble. I bet he could come up 
with some device to make him 
become a really good golfer.
T: Do you have a favorite 
club for any special reason? 
S: The driver, of course. I 
mean who doesnt like taking 
a rip at it, and see it go 280 
[yards] down the middle?
T: Did you have a certain 
golfer as inspiration when you 
were growing up? If you could 
play a round of golf with any
one, who would it be?
S: My favorite sport to watch 
and follow has always been 
baseball; I have been a lifelong 
San Diego Padres fan. Because 
of this, I ahyays looked up to 
Tony Gwynn because he was a 
great role model, both of\ and 
off the field. As far as playing 
a round of golf with anyone, 
I would complete my four
some with the games greats: 
Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, 
and Tiger Woods. We [the golf 
team] were able to play a tour
nament last year at Palmers 
course, Latrobe Country Club, 
which was cool.
Students from Qatar campus compete in intramural soccer matches in Pittsburgh
uWdt rdbop
Staffwriter
This past week, a dozen 
students from Carnegie MellonQatar in Doha arrived on campus 
after a 14-hour flight to experi
ence a small dose of life in Pitts
burgh during their spring break. 
They spent the initial weekend of 
their trip traveling to museums, 
shows, restaurants, and the mov
ies. This was the first trip to the 
United States for many of the stu
dents, and the trip provided them 
with a well-rounded experience.
In an effort to promote fellow
ship between the visitors and the 
students here, a series of soccer 
games was organized with some 
of the best intramural teams; a 
total of four indoor and two out
door games were played over the 
course of the week. Staying true 
to the complete Pittsburgh ex
perience, the temperature was 
around 40F for the first game 
Tuesday night and it rained dur
ing the Thursday game.
The opening game for the se
ries was between the Qatari team 
and the outdoor IM Intermedi-Mate soccer champions, Blazing 
Schnacks. The Qatari team got 
off to an early 2-0 lead, but then 
the Blazing Schnacks fought 
back to eventually tie the game at 
its final score of 2-2. Hatem Sa
lem, a sophomore business major 
from the Qatar campus, felt that 
the soccer games were a good 
opportunity to get to know the
Pittsburgh students. The casual 
nature of the event allowed the 
students to bond over a love for 
the game, Salem added. The first 
match set an excellent bench
mark for the rest of the games.
Moving indoors dramatically 
changed the pace and intensity 
of the games, overturning the 
cautious atmosphere of the first 
game, which was playful yet hes
itant. Once the Qatari students 
moved indoors to face off against 
Real Mellon and Bend it Like Nacio, they seemed much more will
ing to play their own style. Mak
ing few player substitutions into 
the game, the Qatari students 
were able to better use their ballhandling skills and play more co
hesively. In addition, there were 
also no weather issues to deal 
with. They ended the indoor se
ries with a 3-1 lead over the Car
negie Mellon Pittsburgh teams. 
Their only loss came against the 
talented Real Mellon. ^
The series ended outdoors
where it began in a rainy Gesling 
Stadium. Before the game, Car
negie Mellon Qatar junior busi
ness major Amas Abu Qamar was 
excited for his first soccer game 
in the rain. The ball is very slick 
and I do not know what to ex
pect, but this will still be fun, 
he said. Initially it appeared as if 
the Qatari team was having diffi
culty controlling the ball, but the 
players still managed to win 5-3. 
After the game, Qamar said, It 
was a good end to a fun week.

The fight for human rights Everything you need to know
Three Days for Change inspires students to make a difference About bad influences and unwanted house guests
Last weekend, Carnegie Mellon students gathered 
for Three Days for Change, a series of events 
centered on raising awareness about human rights 
issues. Three Days for Change was organized by 
Amnesty International and the Activities Board 
(AB), with individual events hosted by a variety of 
organizations.
The objective of [Three Days for Change] is to get 
people on campus, just for three days, to think about 
human rights, said Eileen Morrison, a senior in 
business and international relations and president of 
Carnegie Mellons chapter of Amnesty International. 
Amnesty advocates for worldwide human' rights.
Three Days for Change started on Thursday with 
a screening of Seoul Train, a documentary about 
North Koreans trying to escape from inhumane 
conditions. As depicted in the film, there are around
3 million victims of a major famine in North Korea, 
since 1995. Hundreds of thousands have fled the 
famine to China, but the Chinese government 
violates international treaties and does not help 
these refugees, instead sending them back to North 
Korea. The documentary follows refugees as they 
escape from North Korea through China using an 
underground railroad.
On Friday, Philip Akol, a Heinz School student, 
gave a talk titled "Sudan: A Country in Conflict" 
in McConomy. The talk focused on his personal 
experiences as a refugee and how they relate to 
the current situation in Darfur. When he was 8 
years old, Akol fled from Sudan, spending several 
years in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya. Akol 
discussed various issues affecting the situation 
in Sudan. One particular topic was the economic 
benefit of controlling oil deposits in southern Sudan 
that northern Sudan doesnt want to give up.
"We have been fighting for 47 years, and nothing 
has happened, Akol said. Akol portrayed his hopes 
that the United States will address the human rights 
concern in Sudan. The United States of America 
has the power to stop the war in Sudan, but we don't 
have the will at all."
Most of Three Days for Change was less information
intensive, including concerts and other fun activities. 
By providing a variety of different events, the 
weekend appealed to a larger crowd of people.
FORGE (Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee 
Growth and Empowerment) hosted a concert in 
Skibo Caf on Thursday night. Popular band We 
the Living performed a well-attended and exciting 
concert. Between songs, the band members talked 
about an organization called Invisible Children that 
they support through merchandise sales. Invisible 
Children raises awareness about the situation in 
Northern Uganda, where there is a civil war between 
the government and a Christian guerrilla army 
rebel group that kidnaps children and uses them as 
soldiers.
On Friday, FORGE, AB, and The Womens
Leadership Institute hosted "Sounds for Change, 
an open-mic event in Skibo Caf. In between 
acts, they talked about human rights issues, thus 
relating the concert to the rest of the weekend.
The Olympics for Darfur" event on Saturday 
afternoon educated attendees about China's role 
in Darfur and gave out petitions to boycott the 
opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics.
Each of the three days of th event ended with 
a human rights-related movie screening in 
McConomy.
We wanted three human-rights-focused movies, 
but we wanted them to be about three different 
regions of the world, said Morrison.
The Thursday night movie, The Price of Sugar, 
is a documentary about human rights violations 
in the Dominican Republic. The Friday night 
movie, Darfur Now, is a documentary focused 
on the genocide in Darfur following the stories 
of six people and their thoughts about the Darfur 
conflict. Paradise Now, shown on Saturday night, 
is a foreign film about the Palestine-Israeli region. 
The movie is about two Palestinian friends who are 
recruited as suicide bombers to attack Tel-Aviv, 
but eventually question their decision.
Three Days for Change covered various human 
rights issues affecting different regions of the 
world. The events educated Carnegie Mellon 
students about global conflicts and encouraged 
them to lend 1?heir hands in helping to stop human 
rights violations. Morrison hopes that attendees 
will use the information learned from the events 
and apply their individual talents towards helping 
to promote change.
"Were not asking anyone to be an expert on all 
human rights issues," Morrison said, "but its just 
finding a cause that you care about and devoting a 
couple hours a week to helping people."

Philip Akol speaks about the current human rights
situation in Sudan.
Dear Rachael,
My roommate recently let a guy 
move in with us without even 
asking me, and even though it 
made me uncomfortable, I put 
up with it at first, thinking hed 
only stay for a week. After I 
found out that he had no plans 
of moving out of here any time 
soon and is taking his time 
searching for an apartment, I 
confronted her about it and she 
basically dismissed everything I 
said. How can I get through to 
my roommate and get this guy 
to leave?
Crass Coed
Hello you crass thing,
Well, you are crass with good 
reason. You need to take action. 
Your roommates actions, and 
her boyfriends, are at such a 
level of disrespect that its almost 
unimaginable. Except at college. 
And probably in the real world, too. 
Okay, so its not so unimaginable.
You need to try confronting your 
roommate again. Sit her down, 
one-on-one, and let her know 
whats up. Tell her that youre being 
disrespected and you dont like it. 
If you did the same thing, moving 
some boy toy in, Im very sure she 
wouldnt like it. Very sure. And tell 
her that you live there, too, you/your 
parents are paying to live there, and 
so is she  but her boyfriend isnt. 
And he needs to get the boot. If she 
doesnt listen to you again (which 
she should, because you are going 
to make her listen), take this affair 
to Housing Services. Yes, tattling 
is generally looked down upon, 
but things happen. And I approve 
of it in this situation. One time, my 
friend told me that you have to take 
action to get action. She, of course, 
was talking about a different kind of 
action, but that applies here. You 
have to take action for this problem 
to be resolved.
Get that action!
Rachael
Dear Rachael,
How can I cut bad influences 
out of my life? I am talking about 
people, in particular.
Seeking Better Influences
Hi there, Seeking,
You should invest in a pair of 
heavy-duty scissors. And no, I am 
not suggesting that you literally cut 
someone, because that would be 
wrong. Very, very wrong. What I am 
suggesting is that you walk away 
from people who are affecting you 
in a negative way. The best way, I 
think, would be to confront these 
bad influences, tell them why you 
are wielding those scissors in their 
direction  particularly that you are 
trying to become a better person 
or something  and figuratively 
cut away. That way, they wont be 
coming around asking why you 
stopped talking to them all of a 
sudden, and they wont be giving 
you the evil eye. Because, if they 
give you the evil eye, my most sane 
advice would be to show them the 
back of your hand.
Im kidding! Kind of.
Hip, hip, hooray!

Welcome to the neighborhood
School of Drama presents The Boys Next Door
Last week, the School of Drama performed Tom Griffins The 
Boys Next Door, a play about four mentally disabled men 
living together in a group home. Later adapted into a film, 
The Boys Next Door is composed of vignettes concerning 
each of its characters, some poignant, some comical. The 
show was directed by drama directing major Jon Brence and 
served as his undergraduate senior thesis.
"I first came in contact with The Boys Next Door when 
it premiered in 1996 as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame 
motion picture series. My mother had become an instant 
fan of the production, which then inspired me to hold onto 
the concept as a way of giving back to her my senior year, 
Brence wrote in an e-mail. Thus, I directed the stage version 
as a way of saying thank you for putting up with me for the 
past four years.
The Boys Next Door is set in 1980s New England, following 
the deinstitutionalization push'of the 1960s and '70s. 
Following this movement, many disabled individuals lived 
together in group homes with the help of one or more 
caregivers. Group homes, which continue to exist today, are 
located in neighborhoods throughout the country. The homes 
have met with mixed reactions from neighborhood residents; 
some embrace group homes into their communities, while 
others try to push them out, citing concerns over security 
and property value.
Griffins boys" are Arnold, Norman, Lucian, and Barry, 
overseen by caregiver Jack (junior drama major Charlie 
Murphy). Arnold (junior drama major Hunter Herdlicka), 
the first character we meet, is what Jack describes in a 
monologue as "borderline" mentally disabled; he suffers 
from a severe form of OCD. Arnold is over-the-top fastidious, 
and finds solace in making lists and hatching plans, 
however half-baked. Arnold is one of the plays most lovable 
characters, due in part to Herdlickas spot-on timing and 
practiced mania. In one scene thats both funny and moving, 
Arnold returns from the grocery store with nine boxes of
Wheaties because the store manager took advantage of him, 
convincing him to buy more than he needed.
Next up is Norman (junior drama major Bernard Balbot), a - 
roommate with Down syndrome who holds down a job at 
a nearby donut shop. Norman has a thing for the likewise 
disabled Sheila (a delightful Ryah Nixon, a junior drama 
major), which makes for some The Other Sister-like romantic 
comedy, much to the audience's delight.
 Junior drama major David Berger-Jones plays Lucian, an 
autistic member of the group home. In one especially moving 
scene, we see Jack take Lucian to court, where he has to 
testify in order to regain benefits from the government. Here, 
a very confused Lucian tries to impress the judge by singing 
the ABCs (he cant) and wearing a Spider-Man tie.
The final roommate is Barry (senior drama major Sean 
Hamrin), a schizophrenic who, in the beginning of the play, 
tries to make some extra money teaching golf to the locals 
at 25 cents a lesson. In one of the play's most emotional 
scenes, Barry is visited by his father (senior drama major 
Jon Freeman). Its a disappointing confrontation that causes 
Barry to unravel, landing him back in an institution. In a 
monologue, Jack laments that Barry's father was allowed to 
visit; he tried to prevent the interaction, but his boss boss 
overturned the decision.
Along with some impressive acting, The Boys Next Door 
included a variety of upbeat tunes, all of Brences choosing. 
Selections ranged from Billy Joels Just The Way You Are" 
(which was Brences parents wedding dance), to Tom Jones' 
"Its Not Unusual" (a reference to Tim Burtdn), to the theme 
from Magnolia (directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who 
Brence is studying).
One of the most interesting effects of The Boys Next Door 
is the shows occasional breaks from reality. In one scene 
when Norman and Sheila are dancing, the couple suddenly
shifts from the natural, awkward dancing into a smoothly 
choreographed duet. Similarly, when Lucian goes to testify 
in court, the other characters freeze as he stands up and 
addresses the audience in a sophisticated manner that 
betrays his disability. These moments are reminiscent of The 
Music Man, when the childrens earnest efforts transform 
them into what they wish they could be.

Do it yourself
Make your own dreamcatcher
The dreamcatcher is a beautiful artifact, having roots 
in Native American history and culture. Traditionally, 
dreamcatchers were made by using a ring of willow as ' 
a frame and sinew for the inner web, but today various 
types of dreamcatchers are found, some using wooden 
rings and colored thread instead. The use of colorful 
beads and feathers in dreamcatchers has persisted, 
however, giving them an interesting and attractive look. 
According to Native American legend, the 
dreamcatcher is hung over the bed of a sleeping child 
to ward off nightmares. The good dreams are supposed 
to enter through the center of the dreamcatcher, while 
the bad dreams get caught in the dreamcatchers web 
and disappear at dawn. The dreamcatcher, thus, is an 
intriguing object, one that is perfect as a gift or even as 
a decorative piece to hang at your window.
Dreamcatchers can be made with just a few simple 
tools: a wooden ring, colorful thread-and beads, glue, 
feathers, and some creativity. The first step is to wrap 
thread around the rim of the ring to cover the color of 
the wood. For a more interesting design; alternate the 
color of thread that you use so that the final product is a 
multicolored ring. Once youre done winding the thread 
around the rim, make sure you tie a knot and glue the 
end to the rim so that the thread doesnt unravel.
The next step is to begin creating the web that fills the 
center of the ring. It is recommended that you use a 
needle to manipulate the thread while making the web, 
as it easier than doing it by hand. For this, you need to 
take a very long piece of thread (as the entire web will 
be created out of a single piece) and knot a loop on one 
end; the length of the thread will vary depending on 
the size of the ring and the intricacy of the web. Once 
finished, the dreamcatcher will hang from this loop. 
Beginning with the end with the loop, knot the thread 
onto the ring.
From this point onwards, create the web by repeating 
a standard stitch. Place the thread on top of a portion of 
the rim a few inches away from where the dreamcatcher 
.will hang. Then, move the thread behind the rim and 
bring it in front to create a loop around the rim. Make
On songs for rainy nights
sure the loop is not too tight and tie a knot to secure it. 
Continue to loop and knot all the way around the rim 
until you have completed a circle. The ring should have 
many loops of thread knotted along its rim, with lengths 
of thread stretched taut between each knot.
Make the next rounds of stitches not on the rim, but on 
the lengths of thread between the knots. The thread will 
now be looped around these lengths, knotted at each 
lengths center. When you make a knot, the length of 
thread will bend slightly towards the center of the ring, 
forming a distinct diamond-like pattern. This is the web 
beginning to emerge. While you are continuing to loop 
and knot, you can string beads on the thread at regular 
intervals to create a pattern on the web.
As you continue, you will have less and less space to tie 
your knots. When you find it-too tight to make a knot, 
your dreamcatcher will still have a small hole of space 
left at the center. At this point, string a large bead that 
fits in the hole and tie a knot to secure it in place. Dab 
a bit of strong glue on the knot to make sure it doesnt 
loosen.
Now that the web of the dreamcatcher is ready, the only 
thing left to do is to hang feathers from the bottom of - 
the ring. To do this, loop a couple of threads around the 
bottom rim and tie their ends around the feathers. Make 
sure you add some glue to these knots as well. While 
hanging the feathers, you can be creative by using 
different colors of thread or by braiding the threads 
together and then tying the end of the braid around 
the feathers. You can also string beads in between 
the feathers and the ring to make it colorful, or make . 
multiple braids with feathers hanging at the end. Some 
dreamcatchers have a long braid at the center, and two

Last week Paperhouse offered one take on rainy day songs, a take that 
based on fighting the downtrodden mood of the city in the rain. Today, 
tm going to flip that around: These are rainy night songs  songs that 
embrace the loneliness of a black wet night and intensify it. Songs that 
sound better with rain and cars going by on top of them. Songs, for 
crime.
Now, lets say youre robbing a bank. When youre preparing, getting 
all the tools you'll need (welding torch, pliers, possibly explosives, 
black stockings, guns, etc.), you should be listening to Coils Are You 
Shivering? it even has watery sounds built in, and after you come away 
with all the money, the opening lyrics (Are you shivering?/Are you cold?/ 
Are you bathed in silver/or drowned in gold?) will be prophetic.
Once you get to the bank, it's time to sneak around, right? So you need 
some sneaking music  try Nurse With Wounds A Silhouette and a 
Thumbtack (Dance In Hyperspace). Its slightly off-kilter beat is perfect 
for winding your way around dark hallways in search of the vault, and its 
tiny, tiny metallic percussion will subliminally remind you to be quiet and 
skittish like a mouse.
Finally, once youre at your destination, breaking out the welding torch 
or the explosives or whatever, you need tense music. Pan Sonics 
Keskeisvoima/Centralforce has got you covered. Its nearly silent for 
the first half, mostly faint bells and that noise you hear in physics when 
you rub resin on metal poles. Halfway through, the song explodes in 
shredding noise, sounding exactly like your metal saw cutting through 
the door of the safe.
Maybe this is too serious for you  youre thinking more like a 20s-style 
caper, a half-joking escapade where the coppers might be after you.
I cant think of a better artist to put behind some bumbling robbery 
attempts than Amon Tobin.
With him, youre not sneaking through the cool financial world  youre 
breaking.into something lit by incandescent bulbs and with stucco walls, 
and the safe still has a wheel on the front. I think one of the most perfect 
tracks.for this is Proper Hoodidge;" it even includes little sections 
composed of what sounds like guys smacking their lips in perfect 
imitation of slapstick comedy, alternating with huge bass thuds thatll 
make you feel cooler than you really are.
And, finally, if you want some combination of these scenarios  not 
totally ridiculous^ but not totally serious either  try the utterly-90s 
Black Milk by Massive Attack. For this one, though, you have to wear 
a cat suit, and there have to be a lot of laser beams for you to dodge in 
a slow, utterly effortless series of maneuvers.

Smart People: On screen and on campus
Movie filmed at Carnegie Mellon previews in New York
File Photo
film.....
pillbOX 03.31.08
Admittedly a dark and quirky take on academia, the film is 
filled with smart people who arent so socially and emotionally 
intelligent: Professor Lawrence Wetherhold, played by Quaid, 
and his daughter Vanessa, a wonderfully bitter Ellen Page, are 
the main purveyors of the immense social inability portrayed 
in the film, while Janet (Parker) and Chuck (Church) can only 
try to nurture these characters into a brighter reality
Quaid convincingly plays Lawrence, a depressed widower 
barely functioning in his everyday life; he is a role model to  
his high-school daughter, and an annoyance to his collegiate 
son James. He resents his brother Chuck  referring to him 
as his "adopted brother  who comes into Lawrence's life 
whenever he needs money, support, or a house to live in. 
When Lawrence experiences severe head trauma, the movie 
begins to pick up speed. The damage left by the death of 
Lawrences wife becomes evident, despite the fact that 10 
years have passed. Lawrence himself is understandably 
depressed, but too angsty for a middle-aged man although 
Janet is supposed to change all that as the films archetypal 
love interest.
But the thing about this film is that very little happens in 
it, and so it is very unique  making it, in a way, a superb 
example of what a small, independent film is supposed to 
be. And so, while Janet would typically bring about a grand 
change in Lawrence, she causes a small, more realistic one.
The whole point, I guess, is that the movement of all of these 
people are minimal," Murro said. There is very little that has 
happened/'
Because Quaid plays the protagonist, his characters 
relationship with Janet is the most important to the films 
flow, but the relationship between Vanessa and her uncle is 
the most satisfying. The dynamic between the two is really 
spectacular, and the shining comedy of the film can mostly be 
attributed to the wit and timing of Church and Page. Both of 
the actors peers celebrated these talents: [Church is] really 
quick, and he has a real gift for true improvisation.... Hes 
extremely fast and its very inspiring to try to keep up, Parker 
quipped.
The talents of Page, a future star, were also appreciated. To 
work with someone like Ellen, right off the bat, in a second, 
you know youre working with someone who is bigger than 
anything, Murro said. Church, who also gushed about Page, 
agreed; "I was as absolutely as impressed with her off camera 
as anything we did in front of the camera," he said. Shes just 
so kind of self-possessed but in a positive way.... I'm amazed 
and a littie bewildered by ... [her] early focus.
Overall, the film, with its dark tones and well-placed humor, 
is mostly satisfying. The end leaves something to be desired, 
but maybe thats the point of smaller films-. What is done well, 
not even considering that this is Murro's first feature film, is 
the representation of intelligent people in a novel, modern 
way. I think that all of us smart people, what we do, we shield 
ourselves with intelligence. The minute we are faced with an 
emotional issue we dont want to deal with, we just bring up 
our defense mechanism, which is probably a brain. And the  
whole point of [the movie] is it wont help you, Murro said.
I revealed to the cast that I, in fact, am a student at Carnegie 
Mellon. They cooed and wowed, congratulating me.
And Sarah Jessica Parker said, You must be rather smart. 
Rachael Clemmons | Dossier Design Editor
And that brings a sense of reality into the film, as does the 
genuine messiness of these people's lives. "I think that the 
mother's death makes them more messy.... Theyre just a 
mess because they dont know how to channel their grief," 
Poirier said. The movie shows Lawrence and Vanessa 
progressing toward healing their grief through relationships: 
Lawrence with Janet, and Vanessa with her adopted uncle 
Chuck.
Dennis Quaid on campus 
atCarnegie Mellon during 
the filming of-Smart People, 
which will premier in 
theaters April 11.
On Friday, the yet-to-be-released film Smart People was 
shown to journalists and other media outlets at a private 
screening in New York. The production company, Miramax, 
invited Carnegie Mellon to the event  and so I boarded * 
a plane to New York City with little direction and a lot of 
apprehension. True, Friday was only the screening; but on 
Saturday, I was to meet and interview director Noam Murro, 
screenwriter Mark Poirier, and actors Dennis Quaid, Sarah 
Jessica Parker, and Thomas Haden Church.
Somehow, Smart People does fine in epitomizing different 
aspects of Carnegie Mellon culture, although this reflection 
was somewhat unintentional. The setting of the film was 
originally Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., but as 
Poirier said, filming.an indie film in the middle of Washington 
is kind of, well, impossible.
But the switch to our campus seems to have had a successful 
effect on the film. I don't think [the move to Carnegie Mellon] 
really changed much," said Quaid, who plays the films 
protagonist. Carnegie Mellon changed the script, maybe, 
itself."
When it was in Georgetown, Dennis' character is regarded 
to be ... kind of a weary elitist and whenever we were in 
Pittsburgh, I became quite aware of the class distinction of 
the kids who go to Pitt and the kids who go to so many other 
schools, and then the kids who go to [Carnegie Mellon]," t 
Church said, elaborating on the change in location. Church 
commented that this sort of distinction was similar to that 
found at Georgetown.
Its true that some setting markers in the film would seem 
suspicious to the Carnegie Mellon student  seriously, 
Doherty Hall would never host a class on Victorian literature, 
let alone literature of any kind  but Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon give the film an adequate independent film feel.
I think that visually and thematically, [it] worked as the right 
place for us, said Murro, adding that Carnegie Mellon's 
unique architecture was an asset to the film.

The deal with all the hullabaloo
About a speck on a clover in Horton Hears a Who
Horton Hears a Who, a classic Dr. Seuss book, tells the story of 
Horton the Elephant in the Jungle of Nool. In the story, Horton 
finds a small speck of dust floating in the air and hears voices 
on it. The other jungle animals think Horton is crazy, and the 
book goes on to describe Horton's journey to save Whoville, 
the tiny town that exists on the speck.
This story, full of moral lessons and fun rhymes, has been 
made into a movie. Unlike other Seuss-inspired movies, 
Horton Hears a Who uses CGI animation to bring the 
characters to life. With an all-star voice cast including Jim 
Carrey (Horton), Steve Carell (Mayor of Whoville), and Carol 
Burnett (Kangaroo), the movies appeal goes beyond the 
elementary school-aged kids that would read Dr. Seuss's 
books and draws in adult audiences as well.
The movie stays close to the original story, but the characters 
lines are different from what was actually written in the book. 
They don't, however, detract from the sense that this movie 
comes directly from the book, unlike the live action version of 
How the Grinch Stole Christmas, which significantly changed 
the plot and dialogue.
Horton, who is portrayed as a non-confrontational and 
generally cheerful elephant, moves gracefully through the 
Jungle of Nool. When he finds the speck, he puts it on a pink 
clover and carries it around with him, protecting it from water 
and predators. In a particularly humorous scene, Horton 
converses with the Mayor of Whoville, trying to convince him
that Whoville is on a small speck of dust. To prove his point, 
Horton covers the clover with his ears, thus turning off the 
light in Whoville. While this occurs, the citizens of Whoville 
take off and put on sunglasses repeatedly as Horton continues 
to cover and uncover the clover.I
The movie switches back and forth between Whoville and 
the Jungle of Nool, giving both worlds their due. In Whoville, 
we learn that the Mayor is married and has 96 daughters and 
one son, named Jojo. We are also told that being the mayor 
is a hereditary condition, and that someday Jojo must follow 
in his father's footsteps. Jojo, however, is shown to be far less 
cheerful than the other Whos, and he dresses in grey stripes 
with a black emo haircut. Jojo is an interesting character 
because of these characteristics, making him opposite of the 
usual Whos.
In the portions of the movie portraying Whoville, the 
filmmakers took significant liberties in elaborating upon the 
story, as the original story contains very little detail of what 
happens in Whoville, and Jojo is just a little boy, not the 
Mayors son. Some of the details about Whoville match details 
found in Seussical, the Broadway musical based on several Dr. 
Seuss stories.
The Kangaroo, who is the stuffy self-appointed leader of the 
Jungle of. Nool, decides to put an end to the speck since she 
thinks Horton's insanity is infecting the children he teaches. 
She hires an assassin, a vulture named Vlad Vlad-i-koff (Will
Arnett), to destroy the clover and the speck. Vlad gets tricked 
into doing the work for free, and he chases Horton until he 
grabs the clover. Rather than eating the clover as he said he 
would, Vlad drops it in a huge field of clovers, assuming that 
Horton will never find it.
Horton, of course, finds the clover, much to the Kangaroos 
dismay. She orders him tied and caged, and tells the 
Wickersham Brothers (a family of monkeys) to boil the speck 
in Beezlenut oil. The residents of Whoville make enough 
noise to be heard, proving that they do exist, and the speck is 
saved, just like in the book.
At certain parts of the movie, the animation switches from 
CGI to other forms of animation, creating an interesting effect. 
In one scene, Horton pictures the inhabitants of the speck as 
drawings that look very much like those found in Dr. Seuss's 
books. Another instance arises when-Horton imagines using 
an anime-style fight to get the speck to safety.
The movie was put together well, providing entertainment 
for all ages, and is definitely worth seeing, even for 
rhyme-ophobes: Most of the dialogue doesn't rhyme, and 
Seusss original rhymes are primarily used for the movies - 
occasional voice-over narration.

Citys lone Hungarian haunt cel<
Jozsa Corner keeps on cooking,
I by Greg Gaudio |
A meal typically starts with langos, fried dough topped with 
parmesan cheese and a special mix of spices.
They don't make guys like Alexander Jozsa Bodnar 
anymore. They dont cook like him, either.
At 14, Bodnar traded the comfort of asheltered 
childhood for the militia. He took to the streets of 
Budapest, swapped gunfire with the Soviets, and 
blew up their tanks in the Hungarian Revolution  a 
grassroots attempt to liberate Hungary from Stalinist 
rule.
It was October 1956. Peasants fed the young freedom 
fighters in their kitchens, warming them up with 
hearty chicken paprikas and good, homemade 
dumplings.
Today, Bodnar serves these and other tales from his 
past alongside the fare of his native Hungary at Jozsa 
Corner, his restaurant in Hazelwood.
This year marks the restaurants 20th anniversary, 
something of a remarkable milestone considering the 
fact that its a one-man operation in one of Pittsburghs 
most economically depressed neighborhoods.
"If I depended on the local community or my 
sub-cultural community, I wouldve starved to death 
long ago," Bodnar says. "I depend on word of mouth, 
people looking for a certain kind of charm.
Hes amassed a devoted clan of regulars over the years, 
and they know the drill: If you want the charm, you 
make an appointment with the chef.
Bodnar is usually at the restaurant from 11 a.m. to 6 
p.m. during the week, but he likes patrons to call ahead 
and let him know, theyre coming. For evenings and 
weekends, the call is a must. Give him a few days' 
notice, and hell open the place just for you.
Jozsa Corner does have a short menu, but it's best to 
leave the particulars in Bodnars hands. He'll bring 
out course after course and probably pack you some 
goodies for the ride home, too. On a recent afternoon, 
The Taitan took a spot behind the counter to watch 
him in action and sample the recipes that have been 
his livelihood.
Bodnar keeps a cramped but cozy kitchen. To the 
untrained eye, its a mess of baking sheets and 
soup pots, spice bottles, and nicknacks. To him, 
it's organized. Hungarian folk music blares from 
a clock radio, setting the mood. He floats through 
the hodgepodge in a green apron, black clogs, and 
round-rimmed glasses  singing, clapping, kneading 
dough, grabbing this and that, slapping his knee in 
time with the beat.
"Then you kind of do a hop, he says before sitting 
down to rest. "My knees are killing me. Bodnars got a 
lot of moves for a 65-year-old man. He's heavy, but he 
carries the weight well.
He's making langos (LAHN-gosh), a fried Hungarian 
flatbread.
The music drawls on while he works. Whats this song 
mean?
Young lassies, you better adore your man, he booms, 
dunking discs of puffy dough in boiling oil. "Lay him in 
your feathered bed and give a kiss to his funky drunken 
mouth. His accent is thick, a mash-up of Hungarian 
and Pittsburghese.
He flips the langos once, then again, before sprinkling 
on his secret blend of spices. "These are succulent 
and crunchy morsels, he says, passing them over the 
counter. Its paper plates and plastic forks all around  
theres no fancy silverware at Jozsa.
Up next is haluska; cabbage and noodles. Its like 
the Pittsburgh favorite halusky, but its simmered 
longer for a stronger flavor and darker color. Then 
comes Transylvanian gulyas (GOO-yash), a spicy 
tomato-based stew of cabbage and pork with lots 
of paprika stirred in. Think New Years pork and 
sauerkraut, except good.
The main course: chicken paprikas (PAP-rih-kash); 
the staple of the Revolution. Hunks of chicken melt 
off the bone in this nicely spiced broth, and a sour 
cream garnish gives 
it balance, as does 
the side of creamy 
cucumber salad.
He's gc 
humor.
Lets
you saw them
For dessert, its 
palacsinta  crepes 
rolled with strawberry 
and apricot preserves, 
topped with whipped 
cream and
Haluska, the Hungarian version of cabbage and noodles, is a 
darker and richer version of the Pittsburgh favorite, halusky.

ebrates 20 years in Hazelwood
one curious customer at a time
Copy Staff I
Theres no added sugar; the sweetness is all in the 
fruit filling.
Bodnar's mantra can be tasted in all the dishes,>ut 
it's the palacsinta that exemplifies it best: "You dont 
overpower the medium, you enhance it," he says. Its 
nothing fancy, just right to the point." That makes 
sense  palacsinta was served every Sunday on his 
grandmother's farmstead, where he learned to cook in 
the provincial style.
The few dozen regulars appreciate the simplicity.
Mark Dudas, a longtime customer and friend, calls 
in to say hello, "Alex is a trip without the acid who 
cooks like grandma, he says.-"Hes a pleasant 
peasant."
Another retjular, John Kerekgyarto, agrees. There's 
no place else to go, he says from a kitchen counter 
barstool.
Still, feedingthe Jozsa Corner faithful for 20 years has 
been something of a struggle.
Nighttime chaos in Hazelwood was a big problem 
at first, Bodnar said. "It was mayhem, whores 
running around, open containers, dope peddlers.
The windows got shot out or bashed in a few times. 
Someone spray-painted "Alex is dead on the outside 
of the building. But none of that intimidated him.
That's not surprising considering what hes been 
through: The man cut a bullet out of his leg with a 
pocket knife {the proofs in the scar), survived the
tank blast that decimated 
his family's apartment
in Budapest, and 
braved the minefields 
of the Iron Curtain after 
the Soviets crushed the 
Revolution.
to Austria 
through Hungarys Gy or 
province and made stops 
London and New York 
City before meeting 
up with his parents in 
Hazelwood the next year 
at age 15. He graduated 
from the Art Institute 
of Pittsburgh in 1965 
and went to work as a 
graphic designer for the 
next 20 years.
By 1988, hed had enough. He decided to open the 
restaurant that year after "the bottom fell out of the ad 
market" and the chaos in Hazelwood got so bad that 
he didnt want to leave his home at night to deliver 
graphics to the printer.
Bodnar still lives in the neighborhood today, a short 
distance from the restaurant with his wife Jennifer 
and his 15-year-old daughter, Alexis. Its not as bad 
as it was in the late 80s, he says, but its still not in 
great shape.
Statistics obtained from Bob Gradeck in the Center 
for Economic Development at Carnegie Mellon show 
that Hazelwoods population dropped 58 percent 
between 1960 and 2000. Half of its population was 
not in the labor force in 2000, and about 70 percent 
of Hazelwood residents never earn more than a high 
school diploma.
"I consider Hazelwood a shell," Bodnar says. Its 
perfect to rebuild.
Hes tried himself over the years. He used his graphic 
design talents to create informational pamphlets 
bearing messages such as "Market building  it's 
time we did it" and The future belongs to those who 
are willing to build it.
But most of the people  in his words  didn't get 
it.
And they didnt have to. Nobody goes to a restaurant 
for the neighborhood its in. As long as the regulars 
come back, and as long as curious folks make trips 
to the little hole-in-the-wall Hungarian place they 
maybe heard about somewhere, Jozsa Comer will 
stay put.
"Ive put up with a lot of happy horseshit around 
here, " Bodnar says with a grin.
But its worth it.
I've had a lot of beautiful people come through here.

April 1, 1958
Looking for a bully time? Then come on 
down to the Oakland Natatorium and 
Athletic Club, advertised in this week's 
Tartan. The club offers 12 bowling alleys 
and a billiard room, withprivate lanes for 
the ladies. Thank goodness for that. If 
women were allowed to bowl publicly, 
soon theyd be asking for even more

The Spring Carnival Committee 
announces a mustache growing 
competition. The contest is open to all 
males on campus, but Im sure that if a 
female wanted to give it a go, she would 
be welcome to participate with the

of their shaving duties so that they can 
join in on the fun. All mustaches worn 
after the contest is over, however, will be 
regarded as evidence of membership in 
the Communist Party.
In the annual Aprij Fools issue, the Tartan 
writes a spoof article about Indiana 
Jones finding the Lost Ark at Carnegie 
Mellon. Apparently, Jones uncovered 
April 1 1983 an important temple containing the Ark 
built by a lost race of pygmies under

was true, because it would mean more

Campus chic
Nature-inspired retro appeal
At spring 2008 shows, the biggest hit was the use of prints 
of all sorts  super-structured florals graced the Balenciaga 
runway, and Dries van Noten incorporated many wild prints . 
into each piece. At Chloe, paint strokes across dresses 
dominated the runway, and Prada emphasized ethereal, 
fairy-tale art. A common theme throughout most designers 
shows was to give clothes a retro appeal by using electric 
colors, sheer, loose fabrics, high-waisted, wide-legged pants, 
and even floor-sweeping dresses for day.
Architecture sophomore Alex Legrady celebrates the warm 
weather with a vibrant paisley skirt. Always fit for casual yet 
delicate days, skirts of all different shapes, prints, and cuts 
serve as the perfect centerpiece for any outfit.
"One of my favorite designers is Alexander McQueen 'hes 
brilliant, said Legrady, who mirrors the designer's influence 
in her style.
Like McQueen, known for designing and mixing outrageous, 
loud, and unconventional pieces, Legrady complements her 
green skirt with a cropped purple cardigan to tone the outfit 
down. A simple black top and scarf keep her look clean and 
allow her skirt to be the focus of the outfit.
On the other side of the spectrum, safari chic" also made a 
huge dent on spring runways, with designers like Phillip Lim 
(creative director of the label 3.1 Phillip Lim) reverting back to 
clean-cut, neutral tones that stand out in warmer days. Khaki
dresses and lightweight, feminine trench coats paired with. 
earthy sandals were the most popular, and such pieces have 
already hit stores and are available at any price-point.
A fan of 3.1 Phillip Lim, sophomore design major Alexandra 
Woolfson shows off her interpretation of some new spring 
trends. She gets her inspiration from fashion blogs like The - 
Sartorialist (thesartorialist.blogspot.com), a site known for 
capturing breathtaking street style.
I wear things to flatter my body, and I love to push 
proportions, said Woolfson, whose outfit is a perfect example. 
Her creme mini-dress is cinched at the waist with a thin 
brown belt, emphasizing feminine structure. Woolfson's 
caramel-colored suede flats hint at the safari trend, but what's 
most flattering about them are the T-straps  they instantly 
elongate the legs and give an unexpected twist. Her cropped 
navy jacket is also an essential, perfect for breezy days. 
Spring is always an innovative time for fashion because it 
reflects the season and culture. This year, it is all about nature 
and our surroundings  from bright floral dresses to boho 
safari, it redefines what to wear for those upcoming sunny 
days. Legradys and Woolfsons styles may be different, but 
they are both executed perfectly and just in time for spring.

Criticism is coming your way today, but not to worry  you're one aries 
moron who can probably handle.
The power issues in a relationship are wearing you out. You both need 
your space. Respect the restraining order.
They say breaking up is hard to do, but not if it's an April Fools' joke. 
Cheat on your loved one as a prank, they'll laugh later.
Make a time machine to go back in time, save your Dad from getting 
hit by a car, get the lotto scores, and bring me back-a clear-colored 
Pepsi.
If The Tartan would have gotten the money we demanded from you 
Leos, you wouid have met your soulmate this week, instead youll fail a 
test. We're not joking around here.
Do not judge other people today, no matter how offensive their behavior 
or how bad their horoscope seems to be.
Do you want a relationship to go deeper? Tell him your pregnant, he' 
either break up or give you $60 for the abortion.
Clap in the shower. Water goes everywhere and it's crazy.

You'll be asked to help support the cure this weekend. Don't do it. I 
hate that band.
You may be tempted to play it safe today, but why? Maintain your true 
personality. Let your hair down, jump in a puddle, start a sweatshop full 
of babies and then rob a bank.
Ask for a standing ovation. But be warned, making people clap for you 
will make them hate you more.
When I catch fish I throw them back in. I don't want to kill them but 
want to make them late for work.

Lindsay Lohan poses 
as Bea Arthur, dies
studen boeynprinep
123 Houser Blvd.
I was saddened to hear of the loss of young 
starlet Lindsay Lohan, of whom I have been a 
fan ever since her often-questioned superhu
man performance in The Parent Trap in 1998 
(she played two different people at the same 
time). Lohans death, which hereafter shall 
be referred to as the accident, came on the 
heels of her latest  and last  photo shoot, 
in which she portrayed legendary comedic 
heroine Bea Arthur, most respected for her 
deeply moving performance in the critically 
acclaimed 1980s television sitcom The Golden 
Girls. (Legendary is a term used to describe 
people who are very, very old but still alive.) 
The salt-and-pepper bombshell of the group, 
Arthur is characterized by her incredibly low 
vocal register, leading many to believe that 
she is a man who sometimes dresses in wom
ens clothing.
Loyal fans have feared Lohans imminent 
demise since her painstaking re-creation of 
Marilyn Monroes last photo shoot. Histori
cally, sources say Monroe died of natural 
causes seven weeks after the photos were 
taken, although evidence has since demon
strated that such causes were aided by a pack 
of wild dogs, the Alaskan wilderness, and 
kerosene. However, aided by spontaneous 
fan-initiated prayer circles and the 24-hoursurveillance common in most rehabilitation

If passed, the 10.0 grading scale will make an old-fashioned A+ seem like small potatoes.
Glenn Stroz/Teachers Pet
ubupau sotn
Homeskillet
Last week, Faculty Senate voted unani
mously to institute a new 10.0 grading scale in 
order to increase competition among students 
and to better enable professors to judge stu
dents performances in class.
While initially the change sparked contro
versy due to its unclear nature, Senate mem
bers quickly explained that this system was 
easier to use than the old 4.0 system.
We thought that with the old system, we 
were unable to really give students better feed
back, said Senate member and statistics pro
fessor Anthony Brunt. With the new system, 
we can go beyond an A or B, and even beyond 
an A+ or B-; the new system allows for an 
A+ + + , which is worth a full 10 points on the 
10.0 grading scale.
Brunt went on to explain that the new grad
ing scale might improve students QPAs, as 
there is a wider range on the high end of the 
scale. Some students, however, are worried 
that the opposite might also be true.
Its bad enough to receive a D in physics,
said first-year physics major Jenny Gump. 
Now, theyre making it possible for my QPA to 
go down even more.
Other students have expressed similar con
cerns, many of which will be voiced at next 
Thursdays Student Senate meeting when Fac
ulty Senate members will officially present the 
idea to the student body.
The proposed grading system would allow 
for greater competition between students for 
the highest grade, something that Brunt be
lieves will benefit all students.
With competition, the desire to get the high
est grade causes students to work harder and 
put forth their best efforts, he said. While all 
students wont get the highest grade, the qual
ity of work submitted will help raise the bar for 
future performance. With six new grade levels 
of competitiveness, how could the policy be 
bad?
Despite the potential quality increase in stu
dent work, some students are still worried that 
the 10.0 scale will have a negative effect.
Grad schools wont understand the new 
scale, and it might be harder for us to get in, 
said history junior Charlie Gray. And for those
of us that dont go to grad school, employers 
will expect even more from a Carnegie Mellon 
graduate than they do now, ultimately causing 
the stress we feel here to continue on for *~he 
rest of our lives.
Brunt countered this argument, however, by 
looking at Carnegie Mellons innovative his
tory.
This wont be the first time were the first to 
try something new, he said. This university 
has never been afraid to be the first before, and 
who knows? Maybe this new system will work 
better, and other schools will catch on to the 
new 10.0 system.
Not all students reacted negatively to the 
idea, however, and several even said theyd 
vote for the proposal to take effect immedi
ately. First-year drama major Clarissa Evans 
believes that the new grading scale will be a 
good thing.
Ill be able to have an even higher QPA, and 
I dont see how that could be bad, she said.
The true opinions of the student body will 
come out at the Senate meeting, and If ap
proved, this semesters grades might fall on 
the 10.0 scale.

Pittsburgh Airport downgrades to 
train station due to sparse flights
ruhedpu loeine
Mad Legit
The Pittsburgh International Airport saw a 
grand total of 10 flights yesterday  a recent 
high  but the Allegheny County Airport Au
thority announced today that this volume is 
ultimately insufficient to sustain an airport. 
As of May 1, the airport will be converted into 
a train station.
The authority said that the airport's aver
age of single-digit flights per day has not al
lowed the county to save any money; thus, 
the funding for the project will come from the 
Pittsburgh Steelers and will be named in their 
honor.
John Carroll, owner of the Pittsburgh Steel
ers, spoke on the creation of Steelers Station 
at a press conference earlier this morning.
The airports one terminal will be easy to 
transform, he said. The money needed will 
not really make a rift in our budget.
The dinosaur, Mr. Rogers, and revolution
ary statues, among others monuments in the 
airport, will be converted into statues of start 
Steelers players, Carroll explained.
All of Pittsburgh seems to be obsssed 
with us anyway, Carroll said. I dont see 
why our domain shouldnt extend into a train 
station.
Jonathan Gutterman, president of the air
port authority, also spoke at the press confer
ence, further explaining th reasoning behind 
the shutdown.
We cannot operate an airport that serves 
only a small number of college students, 
he said. When students are in regular class 
times, our airport is essentially on break.
Judith Capricopia, a senior biology major, 
echoed Guttermans sentiments.
I know there are many who call our college 
town a city, she said. But Im not really sure 
why people would come here if they didnt 
live or go to school here  maybe thats why 
our airport had no flights.
According to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
the city experienced its maximum flight 
numbers this year during the second week 
of January and the first and third weeks of 
March, times which coincided with the break 
schedules at the University of Pittsburgh and 
Carnegie Mellon.
Reactions to the news were mixed among 
students.
I dont really think many students will 
care, said Julio Donovan, a junior math ma
jor. Maybe the airport was a big deal at some 
point  but I dont know if this is true any
more.
Asintha Bales, a sophomore computer sci
ence major, disagreed with Donovan, saying 
that she has always relied on the airport.
Thats awful, Bales said. I really loved 
and counted on my trip to the airport for each 
of my breaks. I will miss the.28X, and those 
sweet statues of the Steelers player and the 
dinosaurs  oh, and the Mr. Rogers puppets, 
my favorite part.
Some students were confused by the news.
Wait, what about the Steelers? I dont care 
about the airport  are the Steelers coming 
to Carnegie Mellon or something? asked 
Laura Hamilton, a first-year H&SS student.
Gutterman insisted that no other options 
were available besides the shutdown and that 
the airport authority has complete trust in the 
Steelers.
After expressing his sympathies to those 
few who had relied on the airport, Gutterman 
said that he and his employees were looking 
forward to the Steelers fall season. ,
If only our airport had been about a hun
dredth as popular as that team, we might 
have been successful, Gutterman said.pSKTRES

University loses endowment to stock market
buiiwnv n7 sublhntt
Market Analyst
Pandemonium erupted Thursday following 
the universitys shocking announcement that 
the value of the endowment has gone from ap
proximately $1.1 billion to a mere $2049 fol
lowing some risky investing.
On a cloudy and overcast but relatively 
warm March day, a sullen Jared L. Cohon, Car
negie Mellon president, told stunned reporters 
and a handful of passersby that the university 
was broke.
I am incredibly sorry to say that the univer
sity is experiencing some temporary financial 
difficulties, Cohon said. We will rebuild the 
universitys financial base, and Im positive 
that our loyal and sympathetic alumni will an
swer the call for donations.
The team that invests Carnegie Mellons en
dowment figured that the stock market had 
bottomed out and bet heavily on companies 
like Countrywide Financial, Washington Mu
tual, and Toll Brothers, all of which recently
declared bankruptcy.
As it turns out, however, the economy was 
far from the bottom.
The economy had really gone sour in the 
last six or seven months, said Chief Invest
ment Officer Edward Grefenstette. But after 
the Fed cut the rates to zero, we expected a

huge rush as people would see that saving was 
pointless and splurge, thereby invigorating the 
economy. I guess nobody had any money to be
gin with, though. .
Following the announcement, students, 
professors, and staff deduced there was little
chance of reclaiming tuition dollars or receiv
ing any more paychecks. So, they began seiz
ing any physical assets they could before Carn
egie Mellons debtors claimed them. Professors 
were seen rushing out of academic buildings, 
dragging cardboard boxes full of books, lamps, 
and microscopes. The Rare Book Room in Hunt 
Library was looted almost immediately.
Although there were no reports of injuries 
from University Police, the looting still had 
major repercussions.
The display cases were broken and my 
artwork was stolen right out of them, said 
art student Alanna Eliza, a tear slowly rolling 
down her cheek. Well, at least somebody ap
parently wanted them.
A day and a half after the announcement, 
little remains in Carnegie Mellon classrooms. 
Flicking a light switch is pointless; the only 
light bulbs that remain are in rooms with high 
ceilings. Even the Scottie dog has been taken.
The embattled university administration 
has suspended classes. Every hour, more com
panies cancel research projects at Carnegie
Mellon. A large group of parents and alumni is 
already putting together a class action lawsuit 
against the university, hoping to find out how 
the university went wrong and get their share 
of the candy from the broken piata.
The Carnegie Mellon community needs 
to remain calm in this period of uncertainty, 
Cohon said. The university is considering 
accepting a generous offer of $500 million in 
emergency funding from the royal family of 
Saudi Arabia.
According to the offer, however, the Car
negie Mellon campus would be relocated to 
Saudi Arabia in fall 2008. Students and faculty 
have reacted differently to the Saudi proposal.
Ill probably transfer to another school, 
said Amanda Levitt. Im concerned about 
moving to Saudi Arabia because of their poor 
record in human rights, especially religious 
tolerance and gender equality.
Another student, Josh Czerbeninsky, was 
okay with the move. Ive always wanted to 
study abroad, and Saudi Arabia would be the 
perfect place.
Bottle caps save Wean Hall from certain destruction
rwvniur-enrw
Bottle Opener
Hailed as one of the most beautifully 
sculpted buildings of the century by the mag
azine Pet Peeve: Your Pet and You, Wean Hall 
has become an unmistakable and inseparable 
part of the Carnegie Mellon skyline.
I think the view would look scarily empty 
without that comforting, large, brown mass 
between Doherty and Hamerschlag, confides 
Viktor Threedy, a senior math major.
Another student also expressds her love for 
Wean Hall. Ive been here almost three years, 
but I still cant get over the brilliant color of 
the concrete. I think the correct shade would 
be dirty brown beige,  said Payne Ding, a ju
nior art major.
Constructed early in 1971, Wean Hall stands 
out because of its fantastic shape and remark
able color, and houses the computer science, 
mathematics, physics, and material sciences 
departments. It is praised for the uniqueness 
of its design, but the cherry on top of this gi
ant concrete explosion is the brilliant block of 
concrete sticking out of its front, making most 
first-years jaws drop in awe for several min
utes the first time they see it.
The architects, reports the architectural 
newsletter What Were They Thinking When 
They Built This?, were looking for a way to 
make a staggering impact on the Carnegie 
Mellon community. In a stroke of genius, they 
realized that they should make the building 
purely out of concrete. Out of this basic idea 
the Wean Hall we know and love was born.
But the architects made one fatal mistake 
when they drew out the plans for the building. 
Excited with their let's-build-it-only-withconcrete idea, they went a step further and 
decided to drill holes all over the walls to add
to the buildings aesthetics. No one realized 
the flaw in this plan until the building was al
ready in its final stages of construction. One 
of the architects realized that drilling in the 
holes would decentralize the center of grav
ity in the walls, resulting in the walls being in 
a constant state of unstable equilibrium. The 
walls could have still survived if not for the 
pressure exerted on them by Adamson Audi
torium, better known as Wean Hall 7500, the 
big block of concrete jutting out'of the front. 
After carefully calculating the vector paths of 
stress and strain that would be exerted, the 
architects concluded that the building would 
collapse in a matter of seconds if it was built 
according to this design.
In the light of this revelation, the construc
tion of our beloved Wean Hall came to a grind
ing halt. The contractors were uncertain about 
how to proceed since they had already drilled 
holes into all the concrete slabs. What were 
they supposed to do with two hundred thou
sand tons of dirty brown beige concrete?
Coincidentally, at that time the student-run 
environmental organization Mother Nature 
Rules! had just discovered that recycling at 
Carnegie Mellon was actually just a myth (it 
was, after all, the 70s). Outraged, they were 
staging protests all over campus, riling up the 
students over how they didnt actually have to 
separate their plastics because it all ended up 
in the same dumpster anyway.
In a frantic attempt to appease the masses, 
the president of the university at that time, 
Guyford Stever, came up with a brilliant plan 
to silence the environmentalists and save 
Wean Hall. He proposed using bottle caps to 
fill the holes in the concrete walls. This would 
prevent the structure from collapsing, and at 
the same time be a sufficient reuse of recycla
ble materials to declare that Carnegie Mellon
was, in fact, eco-friendly. of preferred buildings. But today it is rarely
So, amid the ashes of faulty design and enknown that there is only one thing holding the
vironmental campaigns, Wean Hall rose high, gigantic structure together: bottle caps,
taking its place on the top of students lists
Allison Piper/Still thinks Heath Ledger is alive
Without its many botde caps, Wean Hall is nothing but an unstable collection of concrete. Luckily, a 
suggestion from Guyford Stever, the former university president, saved the building.

Apple recognizes President Cohon with specialty iPod
rueuw boydp
Bleeds Plaid & Thistles
For many, the most memorable parr of the recent 
Macworld 2008 Keynote was when speaker Steve Jobs 
unveiled the MacBook Air, a three-pound laptop that 
makes most MacBooks and MacBook Pros look like gi
ant, 1950s-era supercomputers. At the Keynote, Jobs 
removed the MacBook Air from a seemingly benign 
manila envelope, and in that small gesture opened the 
eyes of tech geeks everywhere to a whole new level of 
portable computing.
But the MacBook Air was not the only shocker of 
Macworld 08. About an hour before the three-pound 
notebook made its debut, Jobs revealed (this time, out 
of a vintage Star Wars: Episode VIVHS case) another 
startling feat of 21st-century innovation: the iCohon.
Created to honor Carnegie Mellon University Presi
dent Jared L. Cohon, the iCohon is the first and only 
specialty iPod since the black and red model made 
for U2. According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, 
Jobs was inspired to make the iCohon after hearing 
that Cohon attended the 2008 World Economic Fo
rum, where U2s Bono was also a guest.
Cohon is only the first of many individuals I plan 
to immortalize in iPods, Jobs stated in the press re
lease. Next up is Tony Blair. Blair also attended the 
Forum.
Naturally, the iCohon has excited members of the 
tech sphere.
This is not only the first iPod, but the first Apple 
product of any kind released in recognition of a uni
versity president, commented M.A. Cuser, a tech re
viewer for The New York Times.
mmmmWhat the iCohon means for personal audio devices, 
or for academia as a whole, has yet to be seen, he 
added.
Adorned with a picture of President Cohons face, 
the iCohon differs from its fellow iPods inside as well 
as out. Instead of having a set amount of gigabytes for 
their music, an iCohon user begins with a song quota, 
included in their tuition  err, purchase price. Once 
the song quota is diminished, the user will have to 
wait until the next semester to begin listening to music 
again, even if the users major requires listening to large 
amounts of music.
This way, users wont take advantage of free, unlim
ited music, said Charlie Pod, a spokesperson for the 
iCohon. We tried that once and  boy  it was very 
wasteful.
Moreover, the iCohons method of storing its data  
is modeled loosely after the computer systems at Car
negie Mellon. The music database is similar to that of 
the Student Information System (SIS), so users looking 
to modify the track title, artist name, or album art of 
a given song can accomplish any one of these in seven 
simple steps.
On top of that, Jobs borrowed technicians from Hous
ing Services to design the interface. This way, every 
time a user pushes play, theres a 30 percent chance 
they just paid their Housing reservation fee (or some
one elses).
But whats the use of a revolutionary tech device 
without a worthy cause? Similar to the U2 edition iPod, 
whose proceeds went to benefit the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, 10 percent of all iCohon profits will be used 
to build war robots.

Flexcar Delorean is efficient, cost-effective way to travel through time
Anrrdsu iw-eriop
Disco Ball
Since its 2007 implementation on Carnegie 
Mellons campus, the Flexcar service has en
abled students to get where they need to go, 
when they want to go there, without having 
to worry about the logistics of having a car on 
campus. For a $19.55 initial fee and a $1.21 
(gigawatt) hourly charge, any student over 21 
can use the cars parked around the university. 
The newest Flexcar model, a 1985 Delorean, 
is turning heads and breaking time barriers as 
the most innovative and exciting of the fleet 
of convenient cars.
Last week, I used the new Flexcar model 
to go back in time one day to pick up a cor
sage for my girlfriend, Jennifer, for the En
chantment Under the Sea dance, said junior 
physics major Martin McSoar while swerving 
across the Cut on his skateboard.
Once they are signed up for the service, stu
dents can lift open the Deloreans gull-wing 
doors and hop on in for a timeless experience. 
Just by plugging in ones desired time of ar
rival to the message board below the Flux 
Capacitor (which makes time travel possible), 
anyone can jump ahead to get the answers 
for the programming exam next Thursday or 
back in time to finish that model for todays 
in-class architecture critique.
Many students are benefiting from the 
program, although drivers should be sure to 
properly handle the stick-shift sports car, even 
at speeds upward of 88 miles per hour. The
Delorean Flexcar is not for everyone.
I have too many driving tickets and viola
tions to drive the Flexcar, said Buff Biff, a su
per-senior trying to finish a business degree. 
My ex-buddy, George, didnt tell me about 
the blind spot on his truck, so I totaled it  
and even spilled my Natty Light!
Biff continued, But if I could use the car, 
Id go back in time and really get Lorraine to 
go with me to the dance  and maybe win 
back my popularity along the way.
For those that do survive the test of time, 
the Delorean is the perfect way to show it. If 
youre going to travel through time,' you may 
as well do it in style, said Dr. Emma Brown, 
owner and creator of the latest Flexcar model. 
And style it has  the Delorean features a low 
body, a silver-paneled shape, and a smooth
leather interior.
The one downfall of the Flexcar program? 
The university cant provide its fuel. You have 
to provide your own plutonium to make it go, 
since its, you know, illegal and stuff, McSoar 
explained to The Tartan. But its cool, Doc 
Brown scored me some of the good stuff. And 
I even get to wear this sweet outfit! he added, 
pointing to his yellow biohazard suit. Some 
kids thought I was an alien when I was wear
ing it, and their dad tried to shoot me, but its 
cool, I got away.1 
McSoars next trip in the Delorean time 
machine? Taking Jennifer to dinner at the 
diner. Im gonna play Mr. Sandman on the 
jukebox.
Thats the power of love.

Spring break encourages follicle truncation
s.piwdu lnpy
Huckleberry Pinnhead
The following is an excerpt from Strong 
Correlation Between Vernal Season and Ritual 
Truncation of Dorsal Coiffure, a recent study 
published in The Journal of Academic Style.
Introduction
To put it bluntly, everyone gets a haircut 
when they go home for spring break. It seems 
the ever-busy and hygiene-conscious college 
student does not have time to fit a simple hair
cut into his or her routine. Thus, when pre
sented with the vast resources of the outside 
world known as home, along with parental 
guidance and willingness to pay for it, a re
cent study shows that 92.5 percent of college 
students return back to campus with a shorter 
mane. We recently investigated this fascinating 
correlation with generous grants from the Bar
bers Association of America, College Students 
for Hygiene, your student activities fee, and a 
scissor company known as Sheer.
Subjects
The subjects were 40 Carnegie Mellon un
dergraduate and graduate students of varying 
lengths of hair, colleges, and hometowns. Our 
chief investigator, Harry Kutt, felt it was impor
tant that we collect a sample of subjects repre
sentative to the Carnegie Mellon student body. 
Thus, 60 percent are male and 99 percent are
awkward. We also had 40 investigators person
ally follow these students home or otherwise 
previously stated break location and investi
gate their spring break activities.
Methods
Being a principally observational study, our 
investigators did nothing to encourage or dis
courage getting a haircut. In fact, our investi
gators told our subjects to pretend were not 
here as they proceeded to crash in our sub
jects homes, Jamaican resort hotel rooms, etc.
It was important that the investigators in 
this study had no influence on our subjects de
cisions, stated Dr. Kutt. Even though we told 
them they had to accommodate an investigator 
for the purpose of a study on getting haircuts.
No worries! chirped Dr. I. M. Humain, an
other principal investigator. This experiment 
was unanimously approved by the good folks at 
the Institutional Review Board, the governing 
body to approve or disapprove of psychology 
experiments. In fact, the board members of the 
IRB wanted to participate in this study. Theyre 
lounging in the Bahamas, Key West, and Puerto 
Rico with their subjects as we speak.
Results
When our subjects and investigators returned 
back to Carnegie Mellon, a record-breaking 
37 of the subjects had received a haircut. Our 
principal investigators gasped in astonishment 
and hugged each other.
Data
We regret not being able to show you our 
lovely graphs. Inspired by our subjects new 
coifs, all the investigators in Dr. Kutts lab went 
out for Mohawks, buzz cuts, and horrible bangs 
from Squirrel Hill. (*Refer to below.) No one 
was available to work on the graphical data. 
Our condolences.
. Discussion
When we compiled data for all 40 subjects, 
we saw recurrent themes. We boiled these 
down to several conclusions regarding this 
fascinating phenomenon of spring break hair
cuts:
1. Spring is the time when a young mans 
feelings blossom into action. He needs a new 
look to attract her.
2. I only trust the barbers at home, said 
one female subject, who requested her ano
nymity. This one place in Squirrel Hill gave me 
awful bangs. (*Refer to above.)
3. The gruff look is in. The long-haired 
physics professor and bushy-maned computer 
science geek reflects the style of the times.
4. Carnegie Mellon students dont have the 
time to get a haircut.
5. Carnegie Mellon students dont have the 
time to get a haircut.

How Things Work: De-napping Pod
uWupWrwu muda.u
Queen of Sleep
When the snoring sounds began to super
sede his voice in class, Professor Chompsky 
knew that something had to be done about it. 
At first I considered throwing bits of chalk at 
the students, but the fact that my aim is quite 
poor and that I also didnt really want to ex
tinguish the short supply of chalk compelled 
me to think of a different solution, Chompsky 
said.
Chompsky teamed up with graduate stu
dent Jeremiah Bosslyn and began brainstorm
ing for a solution to this problem. Initially, the 
team started experimenting on students in 
Chompskys classes. Early experiments con
sisted of manipulating the amount of coffee 
consumed by the subjects, but these experi
ments didnt have any significant effects apart 
from the fact that Entropy-1- started having 
unusually good business.
We realized that the average Carnegie 
Mellon students body is probably used to such 
high levels of coffee already, that an extra dos
age would have no effect at all, Bosslyn ex
plained.
It was then that we decided to try some
thing a little more extreme, Chompsky said 
grinning.
A variety of new experiments were then 
implemented. These included subjecting the 
students to a variety of somatosensory signals 
(like tickling, pinching, and poking with sharp 
objects), odors (the smell of garlic, dirty socks, 
and The Underground were tested), harsh en
vironments (like dumping a bucket of ice wa
ter on them and blowing hot air on them with 
a hair dryer set on high), and auditory signals 
(recordings included a tape of Skibos Open 
Mic night, two roommates fighting, and a con
versation between two CS majors).
We had extremely satisfactory results, 
Bosslyn said, [after] a week into experimen
tation, not one student fell asleep again during 
class. Bosslyn and Chompsky finally decided 
to develop a device that combined all these 
tactics into one. The result of painstaking work 
spanning one entire year was the De-napping 
Pod, named after the famous structure sitting 
in Hunt Library.
The De-napping Pod consists of a helmet, to 
be worn on the head, and it constantly scans 
the activity of the students eyes during the 
class. A slight drooping of the eyelids or glaz
ing of the eyes will prompt the device to go 
into Mode 1.
Mode 1 is a mild mode in which the helmet 
immediately starts playing a medley of drums, 
arguing CS majors, and noises from orienta____________________________________--------------
tion week into the students ears. The eye 
activity is then tested after an interval of five 
minutes. If no noticeable change has occurred 
in eye activity, the device goes into Mode 2.
Mode 2 has the device start giving out a va
riety of pungent odors. Eye activity is tested 
again and if it still has not improved, Mode 3 
is initiated.
Mode 3 has feelers or tentacles descend 
from the helmet. These then attempt to tickle 
the person by inserting a feathery substance 
into his or her ear, while also exerting pres
sure on the person by pounding repeatedly 
on his or her arm and poking him or her with 
sharp points. If all fails, Mode 4 is initiated.
Mode 4 activates all three modes at once. A 
revival these three senses in a person should 
definitely get them awake, Bosslyn said.
The device has been approved for use by 
the college administration and is to undergo 
a trial week very soon. We want the device to 
be made compulsory in all classes, Chompsky 
said. It will reduce a great deal of frustration 
for us professors.
Bosslyn is very excited about the device and 
has been talking about it in his recitations. 
Whats surprising is that none of the students 
fall asleep in the classes anymore, he said. I 
cant believe that merely mentioning the de
vice is having such wonderful effects!

Girl, avoid that short-stuff philanderer
upaenv lniner
You Just Got Publishd '
Girl, you got to hear about this.
So, a few years ago I was minding my own 
business, thinking about getting my Froyo on 
at Skibo, and this tiny piece of man comes 
over, looking me all over, staring me up and 
down, or whatever. I was like snap, but Im 
cool, shit, so I stood around lookin fne and 
took my time.
So he came over and was all Oh baby, you 
hot, you sweet, lets gets some dinner or what
ever, and I was like, Boy, tell me something 
I dont know, but he looked like he was pul^ lin mad bank, so I said, Baby, you can call me 
Carmel and I asked him what he did. He start
ed up with this trash about some software, 
hardware, or whatever, and gave me some line 
about inventing personal computing, so I 
told him all about that time I invented Lycos, 
and he was all sweet on that.
Anyway, we hung out and fooled around for 
a while, and he was all sweet and buying me 
whatever I wanted. So I was like, baby, I want 
you to give all my people cash money for reestablishments, Lohan pulled through with
out a hitch, and went on to portray a wide va
riety of celebrity talents in her shoots, includ
ing Jamie Lee Curtis, Mariah Carey, and the 
Olsen Twins (at the same time). After Arthur, 
she planned to depict Marc Anthony.
But folks have been waiting for the other 
shoe to drop. Now, it has, and its a white, or
thopedic one, ladies size 91/2. (Arthur has a 
muscular build.)
In the wake of this tragedy, I feel that the. 
gravity of the situation has been undermined 
by the views of experts, mostly from VHls 
Best Week Ever, of the Lohan Photo Shoots. (I
just made an entry on Wikipedia under thisSLetter to the Editor
Tarticles perpetuate douche bag stereotypes
I am what modern society would call a 
douche. I look like one, talk like one  hell  
I even smell like one. As such, Im completely 
qualified to comment on the article published 
last week titled Keeping clean on campus..
The article, in my humble opinion, displayed 
a certain insensitivity to the plight of the av,erage CVS douche bag. The author made false 
statements regarding the usefulness of douche 
bags as well as statements vilifying the term. A 
douche bag is a hygienic product, after all, and
search, and he was like, you got it. And then 
when Vista came out and I was all hot for those 
fade-away windows, the next thing I knew, 
they were sittin in.my lap, tied up with bows.
So we was gettin real serious, and I was like 
you gotta move in, I got this place next to the 
Heinz School where my friends hang out and 
talk about computers or whatever. And he was 
like naw, naw, and damn, I should have known 
then he was playin me like a cheap deck of 
cards.
Whatever, so one day I got home and he was 
like, baby I have a surprise for you so close 
you eyes, and that got me all bothered up, so 
I did. Then he said I should open em, and he 
had taken all the crappy stuff off my back lawn 
and built an insane place for me to put all my 
puters in, and he was all, Yeah baby, it set me 
back like $20 million, so you better keep it real 
pretty. After he gave it to me, he said he had 
to go travel to China or India, or some stupid 
place, for work, which pissed me off.
So, maybe its a year or two years, and I was 
hanging out down with Pitt, talking smack on 
that prude Duquesne, and then Pitts telling 
me about this guy she met last week, and shes
term, which is why I feel justified capitaliz
ing it as one would The Gulf War or God.) 
Lohan has a bodacious frame that lends itself 
to posing scantily clothed. Obvi, otherwise 
Aaron Samuels wouldnt have even liked her 
in Mean Girls, and that was before she got 
into coke and lost all that, weight. Im not 
just saying that as a devoted fan  in a poll 
conducted by Ok! magazine, 68 percent of re
spondents preferred Lohans body to those of 
Britney and Paris, put together (but thats also 
because the latter group is fugly).
I think its also important to consider the 
important political ramifications of the acci
dent. For example, who was Lohan planning 
to vote for in the upcoming presidential elec
tion? If someone knows, I think its only fair to
should be revered as highly as the toothbrush. 
If there is any villain in this story, it is the au
thor herself, whose fear of dentists is about as 
irrational as her distaste for douches.
Furthermore, the notion that hygienic prac
tices are costly is so far off-base, the only thing 
further off-base is that Madonna is still rel
evant. Let me assure The Tartan that not only 
is Madonna so far past her prime, but the cost 
of douche bags is a cool $10.99 at your local 
CVS. As a point of reference, a single meal 
could cost more than this, and the douche bag 
is reusable!
On behalf of douche bags everywhere, I take 
extreme offense at the implication that clean
liness is not next to godliness, and though the 
article makes no mention of religion at all, I
like, Girl, hes real small and puny, but hes 
got cash coming out the back! And I was like, 
oh snap, oh hell no.
"And then she was like, Yeah, we messed 
around for a little bit and then after a couple 
days he laid down like $12 million when I 
asked him to buy me some R&D on tuberculo
sis, you know! Two more seconds and I was 
gonna shank that tramp!
Tuberculosis!? Has anyone even got that 
crap since 1986 or whatever? I mean I knew 
this one girl in grade school once who hacked 
some green mess out her lungs at lunch one 
time, but serious? No way he almost spent as 
much on that as he did on my computer pal
ace.
So, I called that no-good up on his cell phone 
and called him out. He tried givin me some
thing smart about philanthropy and human 
rights, but I was like Please, youre real phil
anthropic with all the colleges in Pittsburgh. 
Just keep it in your pants, fool.
Yeah, so now you know. When Mr. Shortstuff Philanthropy-man comes checkin you up 
and down, just get your Froyo and go.
elect that person. I am fairly certain that the 
answer is Hillary. Like Lohan, Hillary has the 
ability to rock a pantsuit hardcore, and also 
turns an informed yet blind eye to certain as
pects of adultery and other sins (like how it 
is sooooooo tempting to hook up with people 
from work).
Probably the most profound thing Ive 
learned from this accident is that some 
things, like rehab, shouldnt be repeated. It 
was Lohans imitation of Monroe that put her 
on the express train to death and destruction, 
to use a powerful metaphor that speaks to me 
personally, since I really like trains. Im not go
ing to tattle, but all Im saying is that Bea Ar
thur is somewhere, holding a shoe that looks 
like something an old person would wear.
felt compelled to respond to this idea just to 
add rebuttal to my own argument. As every
one knows, if you arent sweet-smelling and 
attractive, you wont have friends or succeed 
in life. And, much like life, your insides should 
match your outside. It is here that the douche 
bag clearly excels.
In the future, I hope The Tartan will keep the 
left-wing-conspiracy bias to a minimum, and 
instead of concentrating on the trials and trib
ulations that the so-called average douche 
bag encounters, make sure to include what 
life as a douche bag is really like. Ive been a 
douche bag my entire shelf life, and my experi
ence has only been positive.

Performance enhancers shame Buggy and university
Anonymous PiKA source reveals the shocking truth behind drug use during Sweepstakes
SHAFIOUE RASHID
Just the Messenger
With Carnegie Mellons Spring Carnival a 
little more than two weeks away, the events  
most storied tradition seems in danger of 
being foreVer tainted. Recent allegations of 
performance enhancements and other forms 
of cheating .in the Sweepstakes competition 
have brought the integrity of the event into 
question.
Everyone thinks the Buggy competition is 
squeaky clean, an anonymous former buggy 
pusher was recently quoted as saying. But 
that isnt true at all. Steroid and HGH [Hu
man Growth Hormone] use by pushers has 
been rampant for decades. This accusation 
follows a recent trend of athletes and coaches 
pushing the lines in professional sports in or
der to gain a competitive edge.
But the allegations dont stop there. This 
anonymous whistle blower, allegedly a Pi 
Kappa Alpha (PiKA) brother during his four 
years at Carnegie Mellon, offered an explana
tion for his fraternitys recent domination of 
the annual sweepstakes. Three letters, the 
tipster elucidated, HSH. Human Shrink Hor
mone.
in a press release dated March 15, Snerp 
Skylaw, a CEO for Arcade International, a 
sponsor of several Olympic teams, spoke on 
behalf of the increasing group of individuals 
arguing for a change in the current schedule 
of the Olympic Games. A task force has been 
created to design new events modeled after 
more realistic scenarios which an individual 
could arguably find himself or herself in, 
Skylaw stated earlier this week. M3ny of the 
current events, although exciting, are not of
ten attempted on a regular basis by most peo
ple. The hope is that, with this change, people 
will be able to identify with the games on a 
more personal level, resulting in an increase 
in viewership.
Proposals to model events after the tradi
tional morning donuts and coffee run or 
even the ten-yard see-who-gets-control-ofthe-remote-tonight dash have been met with 
lukewarm approval.
Scouts coming through Pittsburgh, how
ever, were impressed by the citys welcoming 
atmosphere as well as the intriguing potential 
weather variations the city provided. Further 
investigation revealed that the distance be
tween the living spaces of many students at 
Carnegie Mellon and the campus itself could
Human Shrink Hormone can reportedly 
cause the user to reduce in size by a factor of 
three for a period of about 12 hours after ad
ministration. The anonymous source says the 
compound was perfected 10 years ago within 
the basements of Doherty Hall, We would 
trick CS majors by putting up signs in the 
stairwell saying there was a World ofWarcraft 
competition in the basement, in which what
ever amount of money they made in the game 
they were given in actual money. Little did 
they know they were about to get kidnapped 
and forced to be our specimens. Somehow, 
nobody ever seemed to notice when these stu
dents incurred lasting effects, or even when 
they disappeared altogether.
The alleged eventual perfection of HSH by 
PiKA incidentally coincided with the begin
ning of PiKAs decade of Buggy prominence, in 
which they won nine out of 10 competitions, 
including the last six. Theoretically, the use of 
HSH on buggy drivers provides an advantage 
in that it would allow smaller, lighter, and 
more aerodynamic buggies to be built. I seri
ously could have read a book while pushing 
and we still would have won, the source said. 
But I was instructed to look like I was trying. 
We were only ever told to do just enough to
also provide an interesting twist to the event. 
When representatives of the universitys hous
ing office revealed future plans to extend oncampus housing possibilities in Philadelphia 
to students, scouts were convinced that they 
had struck gold.
After much debate, the committee decided 
on a model for the new event. Part of the dif
ficulty, Skylaw remarked, was in replicating 
the conditions of the event which, although 
natural to Pittsburgh, are rather foreign to
win. When asked why he was revealing se
crets incriminating his fraternity, the source 
simply replied, To save my marriage. 
President Jared L. Cohon remains mum 
on the subject, seemingly hoping it will just 
go away. But Cohons silence only seemed to 
make our source even more willing to divulge 
more juicy information: About five years ago, 
I injected Maureen [Cohon, wife of Jared Co
hon] with HSH before she made a rare TV ap
pearance, you know, to counteract the extra 
weight the camera put on. How dope is that? 
So dope, apparently, that Student Senate has 
taken it upon itself to investigate the matter. 
If these allegations are true, it means that 
the corruption goes all the way to the top, 
said Senator Jared Itkowitz, student body 
presidential candidate and currently chair 
of both Student Senate and buggy for Sigma 
Phi Epsilon. Itkowitz announced that a com
mittee would be created to investigate the use 
of performance enhancing drugs at Carnegie 
Mellon for any purpose, whether competitive 
or aesthetic. Each and every person, whether 
student, faculty, frat brother, opposing presi
dential candidate, or spouses of anybody fall
ing into a category aforementioned, should 
be held accountable if they are using perfor
other cities. The combination of rain, slush, 
and snow which could become an interest
ing obstacle for contestants would be diffi
cult to replicate correctly. Development for 
a weather-creating prototype is underway 
but may take some time to complete. As such, 
plans have been laid to allow the completion 
of this particular 2008 Olympic Game to take 
place in Pittsburgh although it will be broad
casted live in Beijing. In this way, contes
tants will have the added burden of potential
mance enhancers for any reason, Itkowitz 
stressed. I will make sure they are held ac
countable, which is why you should vote for 
me for student body president.
PiKA has responded to these accusations by 
issuing the following statement: Anyone who 
suggests that our success in the Sweepstakes 
is attributed to anything but the sweat, blood, 
tears, hung-over early-morning practicing, 
and earth-shattering buggy innovation of our 
brothers, along with a rigorous buggy driver 
selection process, is out of their minds. Any
one who tries to humiliate Pi Kappa Alpha like  
this source could not be a brother. On a side 
note, we have sighted various buggy teams 
filming our practices over the past few weeks. 
Who knows how much of an advantage they 
are getting out of that? Thus, even if we are 
cheating, they are also cheating, so every
thing breaks even in the end.
And so the controversies continue to pile 
up. Perhaps it was inevitable that the com
petitive shortcomings of professional sports 
world would eventually trickle down to our 
beloved Buggy. But that does not make this 
recent turn of events any less shocking.
weather treachery throughout the 6vent.
The current plan is to create a pentathlon 
which models traditional tasks a college stu
dent would have to undertake with some mi
nor variations. First, competitors will have to 
carry 10 copies of the university physics text
book up. the Cathedral of Learning. The sec- 
ond task will include a sprint through Pitts
burgh and an attempt to navigate the mazes 
of Wean Hall given only a compass. After 
safely arriving outside, they will be required 
to scale the face of the building with minimal 
equipment.
Once on the roof of the building, compete 
tors will be asked to play a somewhat modi
fied version of the discus throw; aiming at 
portions of the famed Walking to the Sky 
sculpture which graces the Forbes Avenue 
facing side of Carnegie Mellons campus. (Al
though it is unclear how often students par
take in this event on a regular basis, Skylaw 
was assured that its inclusion in the overall 
game would be a service to the school.) 
Contestants will then be allowed to descend 
using a ladder off the side of the building. The 
final phase will be a bike race through a com
bination of windy blasts, rain, and snow to 
Philadelphia to assist in the announcement of* 
the opening of two new Carnegie Mellon oncampus apartment buildings.

Smart People: A true story
Documentary follows geeky celebritiesDid you know?you didnt, did you... idiot.
Many upperclassmen may remember the filming 
of Smart People around campus last year. The 
movie is soon to be released in theaters on April
10, and The Tartan got a sneak peek. Smart 
People lives up to its name: It is a mesh of smart 
characters working their way through the trials 
and tribulations of Carnegie Mellon. The film/ 
documentary follows the lives of some extraordinary 
geniuses during a semester at Carnegie Mellon, 
including Nickelodeon's Jimmy Neutron, Good Will 
Hunting, Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory, Family 
Guys Stewie, Heroes young Micah Sanders, Star 
Wars C-3PO, and even that bald kid from The 
Matrix who could bend a spoon with his mind. 
When asked about the lack of women in the cast, 
casting director Deborah Aquila said, "Well, we 
tried to get Catherine from Proof to come, but 
unfortunately she was too busy having a life.
In Smart People, we see many of these new Tartans 
trying to fit in at Carnegie Mellon. When Jimmy 
finally got his 15-251 program working five minutes 
before the submission deadline, I nearly broke down 
in tears, I was so happy," said Ira See, a writer for 
Geek Weekly magazine. It was just a very moving, 
relieving moment." Spoon Boy from The Matrix 
gains some sympathy points from the audience 
when he uses his mind powers to levitate bottle 
caps into the farthest reaches of Wean. When asked 
how he was able to do that, Spoon Boy only says, 
"There is no Wean. Dexter, most-notable for his 
secret laboratory on Cartoon Network, fits right in, 
setting up shop in the underground steam tunnels 
and making secret trips to the ninth floor of Wean 
to steal equipment for his lab. "It was touching to 
see Carnegie Mellon students so accepting of these 
odd, odd children," said reviewer Bea Nary.
Not everyone has an enjoyable time at Carnegie 
Mellon, however, as Smart People also depicts
some frustrating experiences common to Carnegie 
Mellon students. Good Will Hunting, for example, 
is extremely irritable throughout the documentary. 
Hunting shows himself as an exceptionally 
gifted student, but is often frustrated by the lack 
of sexual activity on campus, making frequent 
trips down to Pitt. In the film, Star Wars' C-3PO 
experiences relationship problems after having 
an affair with the roboceptionist in Newell-Simon 
Hall. C-3PO was devastated that he was left for 
such a simple machine as the Tartan scoreboard, 
said his roommate, Sanders, who has the ability 
to communicate with machines using his mind. 
Unfortunately, the Heroes genius leaves the film 
early due to panic attacks he suffers after learning 
that his nemesis, Sylar, is a Carnegie Mellon alum.
Sanders is not the only person to leave Smart 
People early. Stewie, the baby wannabe-dictator 
from Family Guy, is forced to leave the project 
after some students get him addicted to World 
of Warcraft. It was an unfortunate incident, but 
Stewie was getting out of control, said director , 
Noam Murro. He refused to go to class and was 
taking over the game. He needed an intervention. I 
heard it happened here often, but I never thought it 
could happen to any of [the smart peoplel.
Ultimately, Smart People is a poignant documentary 
following ordinary Carnegie Mellon events 
happening to extraordinary people. Both its 
happiest and its darkest moments are as attractive 
to Carnegie Mellon students as normal gossip, but 
made more interesting by famous students. Smart 
People exposes the general public to the inner 
workings of Carnegie Mellon, giving a true and real 
depiction of life on campus. As for how filmmakers 
expect it to do in the box office, Murro noted, "I 
hope Smart People is a box office hit. We still need 
to pay our tuition bill.

News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch is born in Melbourne, 
Australia. A Tartan article remarked on the sudden 
disappearance of the worlds unicorn population shortly 
afterward. The article also reported the strange disappearance 
of the sun.
Idaho Governor Robert F. Pennyworth was awarded 
the Congressional Medal of Honor for his courageous 
solicitation of high-class call girls. The award ceremony 
was held at the governors alma mater, Carnegie Mellon 
University. Pennyworth was presented the medal by his 
most-frequented call girl, Penelope. Immediately following 
the ceremony, Penelope escorted the governor to a waiting 
limousine, where she presented him with an award of a 
different kind.
The Tartan reports that Big Brother is watching you. He 
knows you are committing Thoughtcrimes, and the Thought 
Police waiting outside your door are there to take you to 
Room 101.
In an exclusive interview with The Tartan, President Bill 
Clinton admits to actually having sexual relations with that 
woman, Miss Lewinsky. Off the record, President Clinton 
and the articles author go hetero-cruising.
Someone started some war in Middle Earth, and people had 
different feelings about it. Then the Terminator saved the 
Oscars by starring as the Governator.
An unnamed woman levied charges against the robotics 
department, claiming A robot ate my baby. Officers 
responding to the womans initial 911 call reported as 
evidence a bad Australian accent and empty paint thinner 
cans. The charges were never substantiated, and requests 
for a follow-up interview from The Tartan were never 
returned.

Lindsay Lohan and Michael Bolton star as Diana and 
Blythe, a happy-go-lucky middle-aged couple just 
minutes away from the vacation of their lives. That is, 
until they learn they must save the world. Maximus 
Bonor, convincingly portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr.,

his lifelong obsession is the complete takeover of 
Cyprus, a little-regarded Eastern European country 
with a terrible secret. Without giving anything away, 
lets just say Chernobyl was no accident. With a 
climax including the longest cinematic staring contest 
in history between Karate Kid star Ralph Macchio 
and Max Bonor, this is one film sure to be talked up 
during awards season. Directed by Burt Reynolds.

An Affair of the Stately Kind
Thursday 8 a.m. and Friday past your bedtime
Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves are wombat 
exterminators who suddenly find themselves on the run 
due to a deadly gassing mix-up involving a koala and 
a panda. As refugees in Cuba, each finds the love of 
his life in cellist/dancer Jamie the Gypsy. High-octane 
donkey chases abound as Tom Selleck joins our motley 
crew as a vagabond, along with forgotten former WWF 
wrestler Viceroy the Viper (who knows the truth behind 
the wild jungle), but no one can find the key to his little 
locked room to find the secret. The horrifying truth does 
finally get revealed, after a series of explosions that are 
sure to make this film a lock for Best Visual Effects. But 
the question remains: Was he a she in the end, or just 
pretending?

Batmans Affair
A Thursday within the next three weeks
A musical best described as a blend of Requiem 
for a Dream and Batman, Batmans Affair tells 
the stoner version of the life of Gothams caped 
crusader. Starting with an awkward opening 
sequence involving a nude statue of James Dean 
and a couple from Moscow, this movie refuses to 
let your eyes go even as they scream for mercy. 
From Catwoman, played by an over-Botoxed Teri 
Hatcher, to heroin addiction, to Christian Bales
40-minute shirtless meditation sequence with 
the only noise being the occasional neck crack, 
this movie showcases more absurdities than a 
Carnegie Mellon architecture studio. However, 
the film does have a heartwarming ending 
involving a mime and Batmans love child that no 
one with a conscience can afford to miss.
