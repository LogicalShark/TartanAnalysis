MISS MISTAKEN 
Tremendious Success. Makes a Hit at both Performances.
E'or a third annual production, Miss Mistaken 
was a marvel; for a college performance, it left little 
to be desired, and as an offering to the general public 
whether particularly interested in Carnegie Tech or 
not, it was an interesting, well acted, well danced 
and staged dramatic offering. The excellence could 
be appreciated by the threatre going public as well 
as the student body.
The afternoon audience was of fair size and sup
plied in enthusiasm, what they lacked in numbers. 
This performance, being the first before any au
dience, was slightly rough in the finer details, but it 
safe to say there was nothing amiss to anyone not 
knowing the lines of the play. At times the orches
tra was louder during solos that was desirable. The 
dancing chorus became in doubt about the length of 
one of the encores, and that is practically -all that 
can be found fault with.
In the evening, the audience was all that could be 
desired. The performance before such a house had 
the polish lacking in the afternoon, and all of the 
vim and go that is becoming an established thing 
with White Friar productions. The entire perform
ance was better in every way.
The best means of obtaining the opinion of the 
outside public is the quote from the newspapers re
ports of the performances. From the student view
point much can be said. Rigaumont, with the ex
perience of playing last year in the same kind of a 
part, left little to be desired. His irresistable man
nerisms while speaking lines or merely being part
of the stage picture are splendid. The only other 
member of last years cast to appear was Ottmar 
Tishlarich. In our opinion, he was quite up to the 
high mark of high comedy he made last year. It 
was a genuine surprise to see the showing made by 
the new men. McCarty, Jones, and Lane are the 
best comedy trio the Friars have ever had. With 
the knowledge of what these men can do, Mr. Edmundson should be able to produce a play for next 
season that will have an all-star cast. Smith, Craw
ford and Deets displayed their ability to take more 
or less straight parts in good fashion. The other 
two new men in the cast, Lamoree and Dillenback 
made it evident that handeling of their parts is not 
a matter known to old Friars exclusively. Fleming 
deserves special mention for his cast work, and the 
greatest praise for his clsver and graceful dancing, 
which made a distinct hit with both audiences.
Nothing but the highest praise can be given the 
dancing chorus for their appearance and work. 
Evans and Lea made the best looking girls and 
Boggs the cutest. The exact precision of every 
movement and team work of the chorus has not been 
surpassed by any visiting this city.
The Glee Chorus while in a fine state of training, 
was criticized slightly for not putting more volume 
into their* songs. It takes lots of sound to go over 
an orchestra and fill a big theatre. Altogether the 
only things that can be said are those that could 
have been remedied by a performance or two in ad
vance of the Pittsburg appearance.

The following newspaper clipping from the Pitts
burg Dispatch is typical of the general run:
THE WHITE FRIARS
PRESENT GOOD SHOW
IN CLEVER FASHION.
Tech Students Pack Alvin With Miss Mistaken 
in Their Best Work.
MUCH EXCELLENT MUSIC.
By Charles Wakefield Cadman.
The White Friars of the Carnegie Tech School 
gave their third annual performance last evening to 
a packed house at the Alvin. The production was 
especially written by Mr. Walter Edmundson for 
the Friars and was also staged by him. Miss Mis
taken proved to be a bright, breezy, snappy little 
offering, well written, and if played by a profession
al company would compare with any of the Broadway 
successes. A clever plot, catchy music and several 
original situations made a good medium for eleven 
characters and some twenty odd chorus girls and 
boys to exploit their talent.
Mr. Rigaumont as the hotel proprietor was a capi
tal Frenchman, drawing the character in a most 
professional manner. Mr. McCarty assumed the 
role of the village police and injected much humor 
into the part. The Butts of Mr. Jones was clever
ly acted and showed great histronic talent. It was 
one of the bright spots in the show. Mr. Deets as 
the poet made the most of his part. The old 
maid of Mr. Lamoree proved another bit of good 
acting, while the two other female characters were 
taken by Messrs. Fleming and Dillenback. Mr. 
Smith, Mr. Lane and Mr. Crawford fitted well into 
the general scheme.
One of the best features of the production was the 
very excellent tersichorean exhibitions at the hands 
of the chorus. The ensembles and specialties were 
distinctly of a high order and did credid to both 
the originators and his intetrpreters. The dances 
were gracefully presented, especially the Harle
quinade. The stage business was admirably worked 
out. The second act was handsomely dressed. The 
chorus, while often lacking spirit and volume in its 
vocal work, came out occasionally very well in some 
of the songs. There were many decidedly melodious 
and rhythmic selections and the audience showed its 
appreciation at frequent intervals. Altogether the 
production was the best yet given by the Tech boys 
and should be repeated.
Mr. Dorrington was the musical director and to his 
credit must be placed a large share of the success. 
Mr. Edmundson and his corps of stage assistants 
are to be congratulated for putting on the produc
tion so successfully.
WAR AS THE MOTHER OF VALOR AND 
CIVILIZATION.
By Andrew Carnegie
We still hear war extolled at times as the mother 
of valor and the prime agency in the worlds ad
vancement. By it, we are told, civilization has spread 
and nations been created, slavery abolished, the 
American Union preserved. It is even held that with
out war human progress would have been impossible.
The Answer: Men were first savages who preyed 
upon each other like wild beasts, and so they de
veloped a physical courage which they shared with 
the brutes. Moral courage was unknown. War was 
almost their sole occupation. Peace existed only 
for short periods that tribes might regain strength 
to resume the sacred duty of killing each other.
Advance in civilization was impossible while war 
reigned. Only as wars became less frequent and 
long intervals of peace supervened, could civilization, 
the mother of true heroism, take root. Civilization 
has advanced just as war has receded, until in our 
day peace has become the rule and war the excep
tion. Arbitration of international disputes grows 
more and more in favor. Successive generations of 
men now live and die without seeing war; and in
stead of the army and navy furnishing the only ca
reers worthy of gentlemen, it is with difficulty that 
civilized nations can today obtain a sufficient supply 
of either officers or men.
In the past mans only method for removing ob
stacles and attaining desired ends was to use brute 
courage. The advance of civilization has developed 
moral courage. We use more beneficent means than 
men did of old. Britain in the eighteenth century 
used force to prevent American independence. In 
more recent times she graciously grants Canada the 
rights denied America; and, instead of coercing the 
Dutch in South Africa, wins them by granting selfgovernment. The United States also receives an 
award of the powers against China, and, finding it in 
excess of her expenditures, in the spirit of the new
er time, returns ten millions of dollars. Won by this 
act of justice, China devotes the sum to the educa
tion of Chinese students in the Republics universi
ties. The greatest force is no longer that of brutal 
war, which sows the seeds of future wars, but the 
supreme force of gentleness and generositythe gold
en rule.
The pen is rapidly superseding the sword. Ar
bitration is banishing war. More than five hundred 
international disputes have already been peacefully 
settled. Civilization, not barbarism, is the mother of 
true heroism.
Our lately departed poet and disciple of peace, 
Richard Watson Gilder, has left us the answer to the 
false idea that brute force employed against our felI6ws ranks with heroic moral courage exerted to 
save or serve them: 

---------------------------------------------------

-HE TARTANi
Twas said: When roll of drum and battles roar 
Shall cease upon the earth, O, then no more 
The deed, the race, of heroes in the land.
But scarce that word was breathed when one small 
hand
Lifted victorious oer a giant wrong
That had its victims crushed through ages long;
Some woman set her pale and quivering face,
Firm as a rock, against a mans disgrace;
A little child suffered in silence lest
His savage pain should wound a mothers breast;
Some quiet scholar flung his gauntlet down
And risked, in Truths great .name, the synods frown;
A civic hero, in the calm realm of laws,
Did that which suddenly drew a worlds applause; 
And one to the pest his lithe young body gave 
That he a thousand thousand lives might save.
On the field of carnage men lose all human in
stincts in the struggle to protect themselves. The 
true heroism inspired by moral courage prompts 
firemen, policemen, sailors, miners, and others to 
volunteer and risk their lives to save the lives^ of 
their fellowmen. Such heroism is now of everyday 
occurrence.
In our age there is no more reason for permitting 
war between civilized nations than for relaxing the 
reign of law within nations, which compels men to 
submit their personal disputes to peaceful courts, 
and never dreams that by doing so they will be 
made less heroic.
A peace league of the foremost nations should 
put an end to the possibility of war among them
selves and compel other nations to submit their 
disputes to peaceful tribunals. Since war decides 
not which is wrong, but only which is strong, it is 
difficult to understand how a truly heroic or con
scientious man can ever favor appeal to it, unless, 
after proffering peaceful arbitration, his country is 
attacked.
Should ever our country have a dispute with anoth
er, the demand should come from an irresistible 
number of the most enlightened and heroic of our 
people that our government should In its right 
hand carry gentle peace, and offer its adversary ar
bitration.
When war ceases, the sense of human brother
hood will be strengthened and Heroism will no 
longer mean to kill, but only to serve or save our 
fellows.
AVIATION AND CITY PLANNING.
The influences of aeronautics on City Building 
was the unique subject of a paper read at the thirtyeighth annual meeting of Philadelphias Fairmount 
Park Art association, and now published in the cur
rent annual report. The address was delivered by 
George Oakley Totten, Jr., A. A. I. A., That aero
nautics will give to the aerial traveler a perfect and 
comprehensive view of the entire city must prove, 
he claimed, an enormous stimulus to all plans for 
improvement in city building. The perfection of 
these plans will now be seen more fully than their 
originators could have hoped. Think what it will 
be," he exclaimed at another point in the address, 
to see the famous cities of Europe as the aviator 
will view them, looking at them from the sky and 
not from the streets; to pass above Rome and to 
have below us the wonderful picture of its historic 
palaces, its domes and temples, and the course of 
the Tiber crossed with its arched bridges; to see 
Taormino, with its ruins of columns and arches, the 
great stones of its theatre scattered on the ground; 
to visit in this way Venice and Florence and Na
ples; to see how the great cathedral of Strasburg 
lifts itself in solitary majesty above the rest of the 
city; to see perfectly the whole plan of the Tuileries 
Gardens and the Trocadero. . . .to be above the gar
dens of Charles V. at Seville, and above the Alham
bra. Aeronautics, he felt sure, would give rise to a 
new series of architectural problems. He noted 
that houses for dirigible balloons have already been 
built in practically all civilized countries, and said, 
there is no reason why these hangars should not be 
architectural and beautiful in treatment. The sim
ple conditions for such buildings are artistic. Han
gar, it should possibly be explained for those who 
want to practice designing them, is our latest im
ported word. It is the balloon barn, or the garage 
of the aeroplane. The speaker named as Philadel
phia structures that had roofs suitable to serve as 
landing places for aeroplanes the North American, 
Wanamaker and Land Title buildings. He added: 
The Bellevue-Stratford has a beautiful roof garden 
and undoubtedly in the future will have a landing 
platform for the use of aerial travelers. Aeronau
tics will make necessary some system of landmarks 
and special charts, distinctive marks by day and 
lights by night, with corresponding marks on the 
aviators charts. It has been suggested that the 
street lights in the different cities might vary in 
color, and the name of the city be marked in some 
way upon a roof or platform. ... It has been 
suggested that floating aerial hotels may be anchored 
over our cities during the heated nights, and that 
aerial theaters may float in the cool of the upper 
currents of the air.The Architectural Record.
Exercises were held in the Assembly Room on 
Thursday in observance of Memorial Day. The stud
ents were addressed by Mr. Schoonmaker, Mr. Alex
ander Dempster and Mr. Wilson, all veteians of the 
Civil war. Director Hamerschlag introduced the 
speakers,

EDITORIAL
A COMMUNICATION.!
To the students of C. T. S. and those interested in 
its work:
Has it ever occured to the average student of C. 
T. S. that the place which he fills in the school is not 
only that of one desirous of learning engineering, but 
also one of a citizen of the republic and that the fu
ture of the country will depend upon the type of 
men that re graduated? Refering to last waek!s 
issue of the Tartan, which quotes an editorial from 
the Boston Tech, we notice with pleasure the follow
ing: that although it is true we attend largely with 
the intention of getting the ability to comprehend 
the various forms of engineering and science, we also 
come for another purposeto be moulded into REAL 
men. Carefully consider this statement. Ask your
self the question: what efforts or strides at C. T. S. 
have been made to produce such men? Is the pur
pose of this institution only that of turning out en
gineers, without any consideration of the moral con
dition of the men? If such is the case its work is 
half finished, for an engineering knowledge does not 
produce the type of man so much in demand at the 
present day.
The chief center of moral influence lies with the 
instructor. His conversation, actions and teachings 
should be such that it is only beneficial to the stu
dent in his educational and moral training.. Can we 
honestly say that such has been the case? With few 
exceptions it has been the opposite way and do we 
dare to think of the results that may be produced 
upon the man in the future? How much moral in
fluence has been radiated from these supposed 
centers of moral influence?
Our school has the honor of being one of the great
est of the land as an educational institution, but from 
prominent men of this city come the land as an edu
cational institution, but from prominent men of this 
city come the delcarations, that as regards its moral 
tone it is one of the lowest. Have these objections 
and declarations been well founded? Evidence is 
not lacking.. One man has left these schools for this 
very reason.. Others have complained and declared 
its condition.. A prominent society of this institution 
has even fostered such conditions of immortality. 
And why should the immorality of the schools be 
denied when such evidence exist?
The most apparent evidence is that to be had in 
the class room where the conditions are of the lowest 
in the majority of cases.. Vile jokes and stories sup
plant the instruction most necessary to the student. 
Does this speak well for the honor of Tech?. Its 
morality should be as high a standard as its educa
tional standing.. As a student body we have a right 
to demand a higher standard from those who are 
above us. It is the duty of the Director and the facul
ty to see that it is sustained, for the type of men 
graduated from these schools will indicate the type 
of men who comprise the institution. It is a vital sub
ject and must be considered by every student who 
professes loyalty to the school.. It is within the 
grasp of the student to wipe out this blot of immor
ality which exists about us and is beginning to come 
before the public. It spells a bad name for the schools 
the faculty, the graduates and students unless im
mediate action is taken for reform.

THE WHITE FRIARS.
For a college club, the White Friars is truly a 
remarkable one. In its short existence of three years 
it has risen to a place that has caused a competent 
and unbiased critic to say that it has but one rival 
in college circles in the United States for the ex
cellence of its performances. This is saying a very 
great deal. On the other hand, the club was started 
with a definite policy based on the experience and 
failure of older clubs in other colleges and univer
sities, and only the very best of their features adopt
ed to make up the partee. Careful management and 
hard work upon these good principles has placed 
the Friars where they are today.
We think that their influence on the student ac
tivity situation here at Carnegie will be very marked.

In the first place it is a shining example of what can 
be done through hard work, and by a number com
bining with a definite goal in sight. The good fel 
lowship promoted between the members of the dif
ferent schools is another feature that cannot long be 
overlooked, it affords a common meeting ground 
with a common interest for day and night men alike; 
it builds up lasting friendships where none would 
have been formed, and cements over the differences 
arising from the prominence or obscurity of the* 
different schools. Is not this one of the big things 
of life?
WHITE FRIAR DINNER.
To properly close the season, the members of the 
White Friars entertained the members of the Miss 
Mistaken company at dinner at the Fort Pitt Hotel, 
Monday night. The private dining room on the sec
ond floor was utilized for the scene of good fellow
ship.
Songs from the three productions of the club, 
stories from old members present, and words of en
couragement and guidance from the executive staff 
were features of the evening. A burlesque on the 
most prominent scenes of Miss Mistaken given 
by this years cast with each one doing anothers 
part, was one of the hits of the affair. After the 
dinner, Walter B. Edmundson, coach and stagedirector, was presented with a large loving cup with 
a suitable inscription, and Mr. Wm. McD. Dorrington 
was the recipient of a handsome gold watch fob.
Speeches were made by the coach, musical direc
tor, business manager, secrtary, as well as by other 
members of the executive staff, together with all of 
those present who had played in former productions. 
Arriving late and receiving a hearty welcome, Dean 
Connelley of the School for Apprentices and Journey
men, spoke briefly on the attitude of the general 
faculty of the Schools toward the White Friars and 
of the lasting benefits to be derived from connection 
with such a hard working body. He praised this 
years work in glowing tones, and predicted great 
things in the future for the Friars.
The Board of Governors announced the following 
elections to the under-graduate membership of the 
club: J. K. Lamoree, L. C. Dillenback, H. A. McCarty, 
W. Jones, Jr., H. P. Smith, C. M. Crawford, W. S. 
Boggs, W. M. Lea, F. M. Barkwill, D. L. Evans, R.

LITTLE BY LITTLE.
The fact that most undergraduates fail to read 
while in college is not necessarily due to lack of
mentality on their part, but to the existence of other 
interests compelling a prior claim on the time and 
attention. College men are eager to read, but con
sider that the desire can only be gratified at the ex
pense of forfeiting other opportunities which, since 
they are found exclusively during four college years, 
appear more important at the time. The flue art of 
reading in college is question, not of what opportun
ities are to be discarded, but of sandwiching in an 
extra interest without interfering with any of the 
others. The skillful selection of odd moments cre
ates an incredibly large fund of time in the aggre
gate. For the cumulative force of such repetitions is 
enormous, and he who runs may read no less than 
he who loafs.
The valuable time to read is not so much when the 
hours are vacant and leisurely, but when the press 
of affairs in the days work is keenest. For at times 
reflection is combined with activities on which to 
react, and each is strengthened and braced by the 
other. Any forecs that make us either think or feel 
strongly enlarge our field of action, and some such 
forces are ever to be gleaned by any who choose 
to create for themselves reading leisure.Yale News.

An electrical thermometer which is very sensitive 
to slight fluctuations of temperature, has recently 
been put out by a German company for medical use, 
to determine the degrees of fever. It consists of a 
coil of platinum wire inclosed in a quartz glass tube, 
through which a current is passed from a four-volt 
storage battery. The tube is placed in the armpit of 
the patient, and a milli-voltmeter indicates variations 
in the resistance of the coil, due to the heat of the 
body. The milli-voltmeter traces a temperature 
curve on a band of paper, and in this way it is pos
sible to study the action of drugs on the patient.

PLANNING PARK BRIDGES.
It is much to be regretted that the architectural 
competition lately conducted by the Minneapolis 
Park Board, for bridges of artistic design to be con
structed in half a dozen designated park locations, 
did not prove more successful. Three prizes were of
fered, of $800, $500, and $200 respectively, and some
thing over a score of far-scattered architects com
peted. The first prize was awarded to Messrs. H. 
Lincoln Rogers and Guy Vroman of New York, the 
second to Messrs. William Pierce Cowles, C. E., and 
Cecil Bayless, architect, of Minneapolis. No third 
prize was awarded, but the design of Frederick Bige
low of Newark, N. J., was purchased. The general 
average of the designs is described as not as good 
as anticipated, and while the estimates that accom
panied them were within the designated limits, the 
actual bids for construction, when these were called 
for, exceeded the estimates by 50 to 100 per cent. 
Nor was this the sum of the disappointments. The 
specifications called for separate bids on granite and 
Bedford stone, and the bids for the former proving 
in all cases double those for the latter put the granite 
absolutely out of reach of the appropriation. And 
then a considerable number of architects, engineers 
and contractors came forward with the warning that 
in the Minneapolis climate Bedford stone of even 
the best quality would quickly disintegrate if used 
in bridges over water. Other experts opposed this 
contention, but at least a discouraging doubt was 
cast over the matter. The suggestion was made that 
concrete be used. On this point Theodore Wirth, the 
superintendent of the parks, came out with some 
very sensible ideas. If concrete bridges are to be 
built, said he, then the designs should be of the 
simplest possible character. The ornamentation 
which may be attractive and artistic in stone work 
is offensive, and a deceptive imitation only, if mould
ed in concrete. Concrete bridges should show grace
ful and pleasing lines, should be true in character in 
their construction, and should have modesty and 
simplicity of design their dominating feature. Many 
concrete bridges have been built in the parks and 
private estates of this country following on Mr. 
Wirths ideas. Some specially graceful and simple 
spans have been constructed, and concrete again 
shows its adaptability to this kind of structure. We 
sincerely trust that where the cost makes the finer 
stones prohibitive this material may make the 
bridges possible. If the competition had proved the 
general and practical success which was desired, 
other park commissions would have been tempted to 
follow the example.The Architectural Record.

MR. CARNEGIE ON THE RHODES PLAN.
Although the Rhodes scholarship scheme at Ox
ford University has been in operation for several 
years, during which time it has evoked the enthusias
tic approval of statesmen, educators, and intelligent 
persons generally, Andrew Carnegie has been moved 
within the last few days to comment unfavorably on 
the idea. Somebody had asked him if he was going 
to endow a number of scholarships at American uni
versities for British young men on the lines of the 
Rhodes plan, and in denying emphatically that he 
had any such intention Mr. Carnegie said:
It has been suggested to me more than once that
I should duplicate the Rhodes fund for young British
ers to come across to us, but these are not my views. 
The last time it was suggested to me it was by two 
Americans, of whom I thought better things.
I do not believe that it is for the benefit of Ameri
cas young men to leave their own country and spend 
years among foreigners. The time for a young man 
to make friends who will help him in after life is 
just in his college days. One of the chief advantages 
of a university is that it makes such friends. His 
friends get into good positions, and when they are 
asked if they can find a proper man for a position 
they recommend their chum. I do not consider that 
students from America best use their time in spend
ing it at Oxford.
No one familiar with Mr. Carnegiesconsistent at-' 
titude toward higher education will be surprised at 
his conception of the chief advantage a university af
fords its students: that of making friends who will 
be useful in after life. In his opinion a great edu
cational institution is a kind of employment bureau 
where ambitious young men may find an introduc
tion to good jobs.Pittsburgh Gazette-Times.
PITT TENNIS TOURNAMENT. 
Carnegie Tech Third.
TROUBLES.
The drummer stopped short on the threshold of the 
Splashville postoffice, his eyes wide with amazement.
Well, Ill be-------! he gasped, but recovered him
self as the postmaster glared sourly at him. What in 
the name of John Paul Jones are all those young wo
men doing in there with you?
Assistants, grunted the postmaster. Since them 
gol-dinged, pesky pictur postcards hit this town it 
takes at least ten of us to read whats on em before

The Tennis Tournament held last week by the 
University of Pittsburgh on the courts of the Univer
sity Club, was interesting from start to finish. The 
fight for the first three places was closer than a mere 
statement of the percentages of the contestants in
dicates. Pitt lost three matches, Allegheny four, and 
Carnegie five. The average of games won was Un
iversity of Pittsburg, .833; Allegheny College, .777; 
Carnegie Tech, .722; Grove City, .388; Westminster 
and Geneva tie; .255; W. and J., .044. By winning 
the Pitsburg team captured the silk banner emblem
atic of the tennis championship.
In doubles we landed second place, and in the 
final of the meet, as is indicated above a close third. 
The final match between Woods of Carnegie and 
Dalzell of Allegheny has not yet been played.
Gold medals were awarded the winners in doubles 
and singles with silver medals to the runners up. 
The tournament was well attended and was a de
cided success in every respect. No decision has been 
made as to where next years meet will be held.
