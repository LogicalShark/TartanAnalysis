Trustees: Its a go!
Carnegie Mellon commits to $41M University Center
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Contributing Editor
After receiving word of large, as-yet 
anonymous intended donations to the 
capital campaign, Carnegie Mellons Board 
of Trustees committed the University to 
the razing of Skibo and the construction of 
a new, $41 million University Center last 
Monday.
The move places the University Center 
project as the top priority of the 
Universitys fundraising efforts, accord
ing to Vice President for Development 
David Maloney.
It was voted that the Board of Trustees 
be committed to support fundraising for 
the University Center and that this proj
ect be a priority of the capital campaign, 
states the Trustee resolution. It was fur
ther voted that this project be totally sup
ported by fundraising proceeds.
The decision comes in light of a sub
stantial lead gift pledged by an annymous alumnus and two other smaller 
donations that are beingnegotiated. When 
finalized, these three donations will bring 
the University Center fundraising cam
paign nearly halfway to its goal.
The project entails a new campus activi
ties center building that will replace Skibo

and develop the surrounding area.
We are launched on a campaign to plan 
and build the University Center from 
proceeds of our fundraising campaign, 
said President Richard Cyert.
Based on the three lead gifts, Cyert esti
mates that ground will be broken for the 
new centerinatmost three yearssooner 
if we can raise the money sooner. He 
speculated that the remaining money 
needed, which he described as a little 
more than half, would be raised by that 
time.
Cyert indicated that he couldnt foresee 
raising the money in less than two years, 
however. Maloney, who heads the fun
draising campaign, agreed with Cyerts 
estimates.
The intended gift is very significant, 
and it enables us to move forward with 
great enthusiasm, Maloney said. He de
clined to be specific in terms of an actual 
dollar amount until that person is willing 
to say go ahead and publicize this.

DH 2210 movies marred by disorderly conduct
By DAVID HELD
Tartan Staffwriter
Complaints from students to 
Campus Police of disorderly con
duct earlier this month as well as 
of vandalism in Doherty Hall 
attributed to drunken moviego
ers has spurred reaction from 
Campus Police and the two groups 
who sponsor the movies, the Ac
tivities Board and the Student
Dormitory Council.
Students have contacted Cam
pus Police to express their con
cern over the rowdy, destructive, 
drunkenbehaviorofpatrons.The 
report filed with Campus Police 
contends that the problem is an 
ongoing one.
Over $200 worth of damage was 
reported by Chemistry Depart
ment officials after the weekend 
of November 10. The vandalism
included damaged door signs and 
graffiti in th elevator. Officials 
of the Chemistry Department 
contend the vandalism isa direct 
result of unsupervised movies 
being shown in 2210.
Members of SDC feel that the 
problem of drunken behavior 
during movies is directly related 
to overcrowding during movie 
showings. I havent noticed a 
huge problem with drunk people.
People are generally loud. Its hard 
to distinguish the drunks, said 
Jason Smoker of SDC.
Drunken behavior cannot be 
attributed to overcrowding, 
Smoker said, but overcrowding 
can make the problem of drunken 
behavior more acute. During a 
crowded film showing, when 
people sit in the aisles, loud, 
obnoxious, drunken behavior be
comes more noticeable.
Carnegie Mellon Police Chief 
James LaPaglia said that officers 
will regularly monitor the movie 
showings if it proves necessary. 
He has instructed AB and SDC to 
prevent drunken rowdiness at 
film showings.
Bonnie Gorman of Student Af
fairs has instructed SDC to limit 
the number of students admitted 
to the films to prevent overcrowdcontinued on page 7

Activities Fee error 
remains a mystery
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Two weeks after Senate was 
forced to implement across-theboard budget cuts because of a 
miscalculation of available funds 
from the Student Activities Fee, 
the cause of that miscalculation 
is still a mystery.
Associate Dean of Student Af
fairs Lois Cox keeps the books of 
budgeted student organizations. 
Cox finds fault with the 
Registrars Office, citing a prob
lem with the budget number that 
she bases her budget estimates 
on. The problem was that the 
number wasnt [correctly] ad
justed, she said, and when it
finally was adjusted, the problem 
became apparent.
We didnt do anything differ
ently from last year or the years 
before, said Registrar Richard 
Rainsberger. Its possible that if 
[Cox] asked for the figures too 
early, shecouldvegotteninflated 
figures ... but I dont know where 
the fault lies  or even if there is 
a fault.
Cox described the process that 
involves the Registrars Office and 
results in providing budget fig
ures to Student Senate. The 
spring budgets are what we allo
cate in the spring to be spent by 
student organizations in the 
coming year, she said. I look at

WORLD NEWS
U.S. lacks plan 
to deal with new 
Eastern Europe
WASHINGTON (DJ)  As the 
dominoes are falling across East
ern Europe, and even the Berlin 
Wall is being breached, the U.S. 
appears to be sitting on its hands, 
trying to slow down the pace of 
change.
The Bush administration, slow 
off the mark from its earliest days 
in dealing with the Communist 
decline, still has no blueprint for 
building what could emerge as 
the post-Communist world the 
U.S. has worked so long to obtain.
Critics charge that the admini
stration now has less than three 
weeks to get its act together be
fore the upcoming summit meet
ingor else let the Soviets shape 
the coming debate over Europes 
future.
The U.S. is making a deliberate 
effort to play down the signifi
cance of the superpower summit 
near Malta beginning December
2. But during that meeting, some 
U.S. officials believe Sovietleader 
Mikhail Gorbachev will unveil to 
President Bush far-reachingideas 
for dissolving NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact, and for revamping 
Europe in other ways.
The Soviets are doingtheirbest 
to persuade the U.S. to maintain 
its caution. The Soviet message: 
Say or do nothing to undo the 
postwar division of Germany 
agreed upon by the major world 
powers at the Yalta conference 
near the end of World War II.
Meanwhile, however, West 
Germany and other Western 
European nations may be moving 
to fill the void left by the cautious 
response of the U.S.
Without strong American par
ticipation, European leaders 
would be free to join the Soviets in 
decidingthefutureof300,000U.S. 
troops  not to mention the fu
ture trade relationship between 
the U.S. and Europe.
The administration does have 
some studies underway on the big 
issues  but theyre below the 
level at which doctrine is made. 
Second-level officials, mostly at 
the state department, are work
ing on policy recommendations 
on issues like scaling back the al
liances, expanding the political 
clout of the European Commu
nity, turning NATO into a more 
political than military arrange
ment, and integrating freed So
viet satellites into the West.
Kohl speaks of 
unified Germany
WARSAW (DJ)  West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl told 
Polish lawmakers that a unified 
Germany would be bound to 
Europe and that integration 
would be important for Poland.
It was the most direct reference 
to eventual reunification of the 
divided nation Kohl has made 
during his trip here.
Senate Marshal Andrzej Sfc 
machowski said Kohl told t| 
Polish lawmakers that demo 
tization must be combined wj 
the unification of all of Europ^
In general, Kohl thinks tli 
the process of reunification won 
be a process connected with tj 
general process of unification 
Europe and the 21st centuj 
would not be a time of nation 
states, Stelamachowski said.

The Oval Office signing enacts 
legislation passed by the Congress 
earlier this month raising the 
wage by 90 cents an hour, while 
imposing a new, lower, 60-day 
training wage for teenagers.
Bush negotiated the compro

version of the legislation that 
would have tacked on an extra 30

Garbage woes 
befuddle states
NEW YORK (DJ)  The na

Nearly a third of the nations 
6,500 landfills are expected to 
close within five years  adding 
to the 14,000 landfills that shut 
down in the last decade, accord
ing to the Environmental Protec

Several states, especially those 
in the east, are shipping trash to 
their neighbors. Predictably, the 
states getting dumped on are 
angry.
Although the amount is grow
ing, still only about 12 to 14 mil
lion of the 160 million tons of 
municipal solid waste generated 
each year in the U.S. get buried 
out-of-state.
Nevertheless, out-of-state 
waste has everyones attention,

Fewer imports,

pear trade deficit
WASHINGTON (DJ)A drop 
in imports and higher exports 
combined in September to nar
row the seasonally adjusted U.S. 
merchandise trade deficitto $7.94 
billion from a revised $10.1 bil
lion in August, the Commerce De
partment reported.
The September trade deficit is 
the lowest such gap since a gap of 
$6.79 billion in December 1984.
The drop in imports was led by 
a $900 million decline in indus
trial supplies and materials and a 
$700 million decline in capital 
goods.
The increasein exports was due 
to a $1.3 billion increase in capi
tal goods, primarily aircraft, 
partly offset by a $400 million 
drop in exports of automotive 
vehicles, parts and engines, and a 
$300 million decline in exports of 
other merchandise.
The August deficit originally 
was estimated to be $10.77 bil

On a seasonally adjusted basis, 
the department said exports in 
September rose 1.9 percent to 
$31.14 billion.
Senate committee 
acts to protect 
ozone layer
WASHINGTON (DJ)  The 
Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee voted to require 
the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000.
CFCs, which are used in refrig 
erants, some plastic foam pr'di 
ucts and air conditioners, 
believed to contribute to the dt 
struction of the earths ozone lay* 
and to global warming.
The Bush administration op 
poses the action because it is in 
volved in international negotis 
tions to phase out CFCs globally 
and it prefers this approach ti 
unilateral action by the U.S.
The action also controls pro 
duction and use of other ozonf 
depleting chemicals and seeks t 
eliminate unnecessary emission 
of these chemicals .
Noting that CFCs account fc 
15 to 20 percent of the globa 
warming problem, the action' 
sponsor called their eliminatio 
the most effective single step 
curb the greenhouse effect.

Uncertainty surrounds accounting error

what was allocated the year be
fore, I lk at what the budgets 
come in as, and I say this is what 
expect/ so this is what we 
rgxpect to spend this year. Then, 
in the fall, I go to the Registarars 
-Office and ask for the number of 
.all students with 19 units or over. 
#ased on that, I know what we 
ican reasonably expect to have in 
tfhe way of money.
The Activities Fee is divided 
^among three accounts: a main 
account, a reserve account, and a 
contigency fund. The main ac
count holds the money that pays
for each approved budget of stu
dent organizations. The reserve 
account holds an amount that 
equals an estimation of future 
student organization needs such 
as special allocations, emergen
cies, and money for new clubs. 
The contigency fund is separate 
from the reserve account and 
holds six percent of the total 
budget for that year  it is the 
back up account in case the re
serve account is exhausted.
Student Senate spent more 
money than it actually had, a 
result of the inaccurate figures. 
In order to meet the approved
budget in light of the additional 
allocations that had already been 
made, Senate would have imme
diately exhausted the reserve 
account. We wanted to cut back 
to have a reserve account, ex
plained Cox.
Rainsberger pointed out that 
he checked his office when the 
problem arose, Its not a matter 
of entering the wrong data, he 
said. He described the current 
system as a system designed to 
be temporary 14 to 15 years ago. 
The main problem being its a 
manual process, and that takes 
time.
Looking to the future, Rains
berger cites current plans in which 
registration will be done by means 
of computer link-ups and adjust
ments will be made automatically 
... saving time.
Although unable to explain the 
recent discrepancy, Rainsberger 
feels that increased awareness 
about what happened and coordi
nation between his office and 
Dean Cox, along with the new 
system planned for maybe in 
1991 sometime will prevent a 
similar error in the future. It is 
regrettable that this had to hap
pen in the first place, he states.
Appletalk will improve with software upgrade
By NATE LOOFBOURROW
'tartan Staffwriter
1 The campus-wide Appletalk 
network, which connects Macin
tosh computers, will receive a 
facelift this spring to improveper'formance and reliability.
The network is based on Kinet
ics Corporations Fastpath de
vices, known by users as k-boxes, 
Jwhich act as gateways through 
which data passes from Macin
tosh to printer or Macintosh to 
Macintosh. The 69 Kinetics de
vices on campus are slated to 
receive new software to minimize 
the loss of Appletalk service that 
many users have experienced.
Accordingto Data Communica
tions Engineer Tom Holodnik, the 
new software, known as K-STAR, 
marks a substantial improvement 
over the KIP program now in use.
The KIP program was devel
oped at Stanford University, and 
has since received many changes 
including some made at CMU.
However, to improve service, 
said Holodink, a finished product 
; needs to be used in place of the 
experimental KIP.
We need to change from being 
a development house to a finish
ing house, said Holodnik.

UshhaltvMntslr .lbtliiC
Holodink said that because of 
DataComms experience with the 
campus network, ... we now know 
how to make it better.
K-STAR is by no means a new 
development by Kinetics; how
ever, at the time the network was 
first installed, it was inferior to 
KIP in many respects. The most 
important missing piece was that 
it was incapable of handling a 
network the size of CMUs Ap
pletalk network.
Our goal [was] a unified cam
pus network, said Bartel. Carne
gie Mellon is unique in that re
spect because of its size.
While networks at Stanford and 
Dartmouth exceed those here in 
numbers of users, the Stanford 
and Dartmouth networks are 
comprised of smaller networks,
or subnets, which are not con
nected directly by Appletalk. The 
zones that might be seen from a 
Macintosh in one department 
would differ from those visible 
from a Macintosh on another 
departments subnet. At Carne
gie Mellon, however, the same 
zones are visible from all Macin
toshes connected to the network.
The approval of K-STAR will 
increase the ability to handle the 
volume of data crossing campus.
The K-STAR package is likely 
to be tested in the UCC Appletalk 
Zone, which Associate Director of 
Networking and Communications 
Chuck Bartel referred to as a 
genuinely hostile environment, in 
terms of users.
If the package survives this test, 
it will be released to the general
campus probably sometime next 
semester, though an unsuccess
ful test could force DataComm to 
postpone or cancel the release.
DataComms first concern is to 
avoid negative impact, ex
plained Manager of Network 
Development Steve Waldbusser. 
The evaluation [of K-STAR] af
fects our target dates. If there 
are no detected problems, K-STAR 
could be seen as early as Febru
ary, though that is not expected.
While KIP is running, users are 
still vulnerable to failures of the 
Kinetics gateways. Should a prob
lem with Appletalk arrive be
tween 8:30 am and 6 pm, Monday 
through Friday, users should call 
DataComms Troubleline (x2635), 
after checking their own machine 
for loose cables or a software er
ror.
Problems experienced at other 
times should be reported to Op
erations at x6688. Operations is 
sometimes able to correct minor 
problems with Appletalk; how
ever, it is often necessary to send 
someone from DataComm to the 
building in question.
Policy prevents Operations from 
notifying DataComm of a prob
lem unless at least three users 
have been reported the failure.
Officials consider 
raising Activities Fee
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Senates budget woes have 
prompted consideration of rais
ing the Student Activities Fee 
for next year from $40 per 
semester to $50 per semester. 
The last raise in activities fee 
was enacted in the fall of 1988.
Generally every four years 
there are enough new clubs and 
allocations outside of Student 
Senates [annual] budget [proc
ess] that warrant increasing the 
Student Activities Fee.
Recent budgets have not been 
following the general pattern 
however.
According to Coxs records, 
the 1987-88 budget was 
$298,708. In 1988-89 it jumped 
to $420,186 and then to 
$486,498 for 1989-90. Cox ac
knowledges the jump was ex
traordinary, Usually we 
expect an increase of about 
$50,000 from year to year, said 
Cox, but $120,000 is most 
unusual.
Cox explains the increase as 
mostly the result of an unusual 
amount of new clubs that have 
been formed. The Political 
Speaker Forum Board started 
up in the 198889 year with a 
budget of $17,000. Their 
1989-90 budget was raised to
$32,000. Cox cited other major 
cost increases including a 
$15,500 increase in the AB < 
Dance budget to bring major 
bands to Carnegie Mellon, and 
a $14,196 increase for the Stu
dent Union.
Cox favors an increase in the 
Activities Fee. If we want these 
organizations to exist, we have 
to fund them, and Im strongly 
in support of this.... I like to see; 
more student organizations, I;; 
think its a very healthy, good: 
thing.
As a result of the increase in 
activities by the student body, I 
said Student Government Presi-' 
dent Mark Mittelhauser, the 
activities have outrun the 
money available for them. I dont 
necessarily see this as bad  if 
there is enough student inter
est in activities, it makes sense 
to keep the [activities fee] com
mensurate with the activities....
I dont really see an alterna
tive.
Dan Wallace, a sophomore IS 
major, warns that though he 
favors funding of new organiza
tions, the increase in budget is 
partly due to the easy accessi
bility of money to student 
groups. The budget will continue 
to increase [above expected 
yearly increases] until stricter 
policies are enacted.

Citizens form the foundations of change, reform in the Soviet Union
By DAVID SCHWARTZ
'Tartan Staffwriter
Glasnost and perestroika reflect the 
changing attitude of the Soviet Govern
ment led by Mikhail Gorbachev. Per
estroika refers to internal reforms insti
tuted in the Soviet Union; glasnost is the 
new Soviet openness in dealing with the 
West. Experts concur that the Soviets 
are embarking on a new phase of their 
history as these reforms sweep across 
their nation.
The Soviets are opening up to the 
West and are trying to incorporate
News Analysis
Western ideas to some extent, says Peter 
Steams, head of Carnegie Mellons His
tory Department. Their economy is on 
weak foundations and is in bad shape, 
he says, explaining why the Soviets are 
making drastic policy changes.
Wendy Goldman, a professor of Rus
sian history in the History Department, 
believes that the need to dismantle the 
Stalinist system of the past is what impels 
the reform movement. The pressure is
from below  from the intelegentsia to 
the working class, she says.
The old system is under collapse, 
adds David Kaiser, a professor of U.S. 
foreign policy at Carnegie Mellons His
tory Department.
Goldman believes that many forces 
are acting simultaneously to reform the 
Soviet Union. There are many diverse 
interests instituting change within the 
Soviet Union, she says.
Goldman points out one example of 
decentralized reform in which a mining 
community reformed part of its local 
government structure. In Donets (an
important mining region in the Soviet 
Union), the miners actually dismantled 
the local bureaucracy and instituted their 
own government, she explains. Some 
of the people are trying to return to preStalinist times  back to revolutionary 
ideals.
Kaiser says that, though the primary 
reason for change is economic, other 
problems in the Soviet Union also de
mand attention and explain Soviet ef
forts to incorporate Western ideas.
Goldman points out that several groups 
are emerging to represent their own 
political interests. We are seeing the
formation of diverse interest groups, 
she says. Other problems  like ethnic 
unrest  exist. Diversity of interests 
remains an important factor in the se
ries of changes. Formation of groups 
like the one led by Boris Yeltzin, she 
maintains, represents a loosening of the 
firm grip the central government had on 
the Soviet Union.
Moving the people to Westernize is;'a 
problem, says Kaiser. He believes th^t 
though they are dissatisfied with tfye 
current system, greatly changing set'aiid 
engrained behavioral patterns could be 
difficult.
Senate votes to limit postering
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
L Tartan Staffwriter
Organizations will be limited to 
three posters per bulletin board 
per event starting next semester, 
thanks to a proposal passed last 
: Tuesday by Student Senate.
! Under the proposal, organizations 
I may be fined if they fail to follow 
the proposals guidelines.
This proposal will make ad1 vertising more equal, says 
Senates Campus Affairs Chair 
Roy Conard. And overall, this 
should cut down on visual clutter, 
while saving paper, space, and 
money, he says.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy agrees. I think its an 
excellent idea, he says. We do 
need to monitor the size and 
number of posters. Murphy hopes 
to hire one student or more who 
will monitor both the main bulle
tin board in Skibo and other 
campus bulletin boards. A stu
dent already has been hired for 
the Skibo bulletin board.
Murphy said he hopes to draft a 
policy similar to Senates and to 
get it out to all student organiza
tions. Once the policy goes into 
effect, we will have students 
whose j ob it will be to go around to 
all of the relevant bulletin boards. 
This person will clean the bulle
tin boards by removing outdated

tions [such as] multiple postings, 
more than three postings, or post
ings over other posters, they will 
remove the poster that caused 
the problem and note on it the 
date, the location and the nature 
of the violation.
The consequences of a violation 
will be a fine, the amount of which 
Murphy predicts will be agreed 
upon by student organizations. 
The fine is not terribly onerous, 
he said. But its pretty important 
if you poster to announce an event 
and somebody posters over it. The 
amount of the fine will be levied 
against that organization and [the 
money collected] will be placed 
into a fund that will be used to 
enhance communication on campus.
Murphy proposed that the funds 
from the fines be used to pay for 
the hired student, and begin a 
weekly newsletter for the leaders 
of student organizations with 
information about an upcoming 
event or the planning for an activ
ity. He added that he doesnt 
hope for violations  but should 
they occur, the money will be 
productive.
Murphy added that fraternities 
and sororities would be included 
in his policy. My proposal will be 
based on the Senate proposal, he 
said. I want to get a little more 
specific with the implementation 
of the policy than the Senate pol
icy did.

TARTAN SPECIAL REPORT
Students respond positively 
to University Center project
By MICHAEL ROSE
Tartan Diversions Editor
The University Center project has 
intended from the outset to address the 
needs and concerns of the university 
community as a whole. Now, with the 
funding drive underway and the physi
cal planning set to begin soon, questions 
are being raised about the contents and 
structure of the University Center and 
about student involvement in making 
decisions.
Student reaction to the University 
Center is primarily positive. Even though 
virtually all current students will gradu
ate before the project is completed, they 
are enthusiastic about the project and its 
potential benefit to the University as a 
whole.
Senior Barbara McQuain, a profes
sional writing major, feels that the Uni
versity Center will have a positive effect 
on alumni relations. She said, Ill proba
bly feel a little bit better about coming 
back. McQuain, however, is more skep
tical about the Universitys commitment 
to build the Center as soon as possible. I 
automatically tack two years onto any 
estimate they give, she said.
Some students feel that any new con
struction is bound to be an aesthetic 
improvement for the campus. Person
ally, saidjunior Dan Holland, I thought 
the old stadium [Tech Field] was pretty 
uglySkibo, too. Im anxious to see [the 
University Center].
Most students have specific things they 
want to see in the center. Junior Matt 
Wengraitis would like a bowling alley. 
Hollands wish is for a new Scotland 
Yard  but more open, out in front.
Students arent the only people who 
are interested in seeing a student caf  
much like Scotland Yard  as a primary 
feature of the new Center. At a meeting 
. with administration officials held last 
Wednesday morning, Vice President for 
University Planning Patrick Keating 
spoke of a student caf as a good way of 
pursuing the primary goal of a Univer
sity Center, that of increasing interac- tion between people. The function of 
. Scotland Yard, the space and the pro. gram, is replicated in [the University 
Center].... The idea of Scotland Yard, he 
said, the student caf, is a primary 
component of the new building.
University President Richard Cyert 
affirmed that sentiment, saying, We 
are really happy with Scotland Yard.
Although features of the new center 
' such as the student caf are almost uni
versally popular, some elements of the 
new building are not quite as well deterfnined. The associate head of the ECE 
department, Professor Jim Hoburg, has 
written two letters to the editor of The 
Tartan about the University Centers 
facilities and construction.
In the original plans, the University 
Center was to contain a small indoor 
jogging track. Hoburg felt that such a 
track was inadequate and posed a threat 
of injury to runners. In his letter, Hoburg 
stated, There were people involved in 
the planning of the University Center 
who had a vision of the indoor track as a 
' 'jogging track... I thought it was worth-while to go out and get a sense, in the 
1 1 university community, of what people 
thought about that.
- After the letter was published in The 
Tartan, Hoburg received numerous let
ters in support of his position, as well as 
a number of petitions expressing dissat'isfaction with the proposed track. Al
though Hoburg says he solicited none of 
this material, the eventual count of stu
dent signatures reached a remarkable 
1,700. I didnt realize how strong the 
sentiment was about this issue, said 
'Hoburg.
Hoburgs second letter to The Tartan, 
which appeared in the September 6 is
sue of this year, concerned the architec1 tural plans for the University Center in 
' terms of their effect on the Cut. In the 
architects conception, the Cut would be 
bordered on the east by a colonnade, 
thereby limiting the amount of open space 
on the Cut. Hoburgs contention, that the 
open space of the Cut is valuable and 
should be preserved, was echoed two 
weeks later by a letter from freshman 
Stephen Simon.
Hoburg believes that current students 
are well qualified to assess the worth of 
the University Center on behalf of future

students. He supports the idea of university-wide polls or referendums to deter
mine student opinion.
On an issue like walling in the Cut, 
he asked, ... what would be wrong with 
simply conducting a referendum? Not 
with any guarantee ... that the campus 
community votes upon what sort of build
ing were going to have. Nevertheless, 
theres a sense that a major aspect of the 
architectural planning may well be 
something that the university commu
nity as a whole doesnt like.
Another student concern regarding the 
University Center is that of interim fa
cilities. After Skibo is tom down, and be
fore the new facility is completed (a delay, 
of indefinite length), where will current 
Skibo residentsEntropy, the art store, 
Dining Service, and offices of student or
ganizations such as WRCT, Thistle, and 
The Tartan  be accommodated?
At this point, nobody knows. Accordingto Keating, the administration doesnt 
yet have a good answer, but theres been 
a lot of thinking about [interim space]... 
until you exactly know when 
[everythings] going to happen, its hard 
to come up with something.... The most 
important step is the dining hall in the 
new dorm.
The new dining hall can take over the 
function of some Skibo dining space, but 
the administration has fewer ideas about 
student space during the transition. 
Speculation on possible alternatives has 
ranged from the use of the first-floor 
MorewoodE-Tower apartments, to quar
ters in Hamburg Hall or other Bureau of 
Mines buildings, to the purchase and 
subsequent use of the Naval Reserve 
Center.
Keating sees the Naval Reserve Cen
ter as one of the preferable choices for 
temporary student space. The Navy 
[Naval Reserve Center] building hap
pens to be absolutely perfect, he said, it 
may come around at the right time and it 
has the right kind of spaces, but we dont

Campaign earmarks funds for Cente
By RUSS SELIGMAN
Tartan Business Manager
The program to solicit funds for the 
University Center is starting virtually 
from scratch, according to Vice Presi
dent for Development David Maloney.
Since it began, the Capital Campaign 
had raised $8 million in unrestricted 
gifts which were earmarked by the Uni
versity for the Center. In March, how
ever, President Richard Cyert announced 
that the East Campus construction and 
the University Center were to be merged 
into one project, and the money will be 
used to help complete the new fields.
With the East Campus satisfactorily 
funded, the University Center has once 
again become a separate project with a 
new fund-raising agenda.
According to Maloney, W ere not going 
to go to [donor prospects] and say, heres 
a list of seven things; what would you 
like to do to support the University?... 
We actually said, these are the people 
were going to go ask for a University
Center gift.
Many potential donors said if the 
University tells me that this is their 
priority, then thats what Ill support, 
Maloney said. And the trustees have 
told them that.
Currently the University Center fund 
consists of a few donations for specific 
rooms. The Class of 1987 pledged 
$100,000 for a room in its name, and 
private donors gave $200,000 towards 
new offices for The Tartan and WRCT. 
Monies for two lounges and other gifts 
total approximately $500,000.
Although the University appears to 
have a long way to go, Maloney and 
Cyert are confident the money will be 
raised in two to three years. This is the 
most enthusiastic Ive seen the trustees 
for any project, particularly the alumni 
trustees, Cyert said.
The bulk of the $41 million will come 
from private individual donations. 
However, various other groups are being 
targeted for specific amounts. 
According to Maloney, Of the $40
million, we feel that $35 million is gmn| 
to have to come from individuals: $22. 
million from alumni, $8 million froi 
trustees, $4 million from friends of-tl 
University, and $500,000 from facylt 
and staff. The other $5 million will cgni 
from corporations and foundations. 
Unlike plans discussed previously, 
additional funds will be raised thropgl 
user fees or tuition hikes. H
Cyert is also being careful about whi 
kinds of gifts will be acceptable for;tk 
University Center. For example, jth 
University does not want to borroi 
against bequeaths, money pledged tot* 
given to the University after the dqm 
has died. >
Cyert and Maloney are pleased wit 
the size of the lead gift because they fei 
it will show other potential donors th: 
the University is committed to the pro 
ect and intends to complete it. With tin 
and other smaller, yet significant, gift 
virtually guaranteed, Cyert said, I don 
believe were not going to raise the add) 
tional money.

THE UNIVERSITY CENTER
Development office busy raising $41 million needed for Center
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Although no ground has been broken 
for the University Center and the archi
tectural plans are incomplete, Carnegie 
^tMellons Development Office is already 
' busy raising the $41 million needed for 
| the project.
The University has tentative pledges 
for two major gifts and a number of
 smaller gifts totalling more than half the

(^Qne $15 million donation 
One $5 million donation ___
^ money needed. Carnegie Mellon Presi
dent Richard Cyert expects that the Uni
versity will be able to raise the rest of the 
money in two to three more years and 
said, We have every expectation that we 
. will certainly be able to break ground for 
 the center within three years.
* Using a standard gift chart, the Devel
opment Office has estimated how many 
gifts of varying sizes it will need to reach 
$41 million. It has also determined from 
past experince how many prospects, or 
^possible donors, it will need to find for 
each gift.
The ratio of prospects to desired num
ber of gifts varies between about 2-to-l 
and 3.5-to-l depending on the size of the 
gifts. Cyert explained that it is standard 
procedure to identify several possible 
donors because The fewer prospects you 
have, the higher proportion of 'hits you 
have to have.
The Development Office hopes to find 
149 prospects for the 62 largest Univer
sity Center gifts of $50,000 or more, 
totalling $36 million. Eighty-six pros
pects have been identified so far. The re
maining money will be made up with 
.smaller donations.
Associate Vice President for Develop
ment Carol A. Carter described the struc
ture of the goals as a pyramid, starting 
with one gift of approximately $15 mil
lion at the top and ranging down to 30 
gifts of $50,000 each and numerous 
Smaller gifts at the bottom.
The development office goes through a 
^series of steps to secure a gift. Carter 
''described the steps as the four Is: iden
tification, interest, involvement, and in
vestment.
i The identification step consists of findjiing potential donors and determining 
how much money they might be able to 
give. Names are determined from alumni 
! 'lists, news reports, and recommenda!i tions from various people, including other 
'prospects, past donors, trustees, and 
administrators. The amount of money a 
'person might be able to give is estimated 
on the basis of past donations and peer 
-reviews by people who are familiar with 
the potential donor.
1 Between July and November, the 
I 'University sought to solicit 10 people for 
' the largest gifts. They succeeded in find: ing seven potential donors. One was a 
' CMU alumnus whom Carter described 
was well known in business and finan
cial circles. The University hopes that he
(two $2 mlllilon donations  
Five $1 million donations 
(Eight $500,000 donations ) 
Fifteen $100,000 donations 
(Thirty $50,000 donations 
Many donations under $50,000
will give the lead gift of approximately 
$15 million.
The seven prospects identified have 
also yielded a potential donor for the 
secondary gift and five potential donors 
for smaller gifts, said Vice President for 
Development David Maloney. The 
Universitys target for the second largest 
gift is $5 million, but Maloney would not 
say how large the actual gift might be. 
The.potential donors for the gift are a 
husband and wife who are both CMU 
alumni, Carter said. The University may 
be able to confirm and announce the gift 
as soon as next week.
Five other potential donors are consid
ering gifts in the range of $100,000 to 
$200,000. The Development Office is 
looking for about 15 donations in this 
range.
The University is hoping to raise a 
total of $22.5 million from alumni. Other 
groups of individuals from which the 
University hopes to get donations are 
trustees ($8 million), friends of the Uni
versity ($4 million), and faculty and staff 
($500,000).
The University is also seeking $4 to $5 
million in donations from corporations 
and foundations. According to Carter, 
the reason so little is being sought from 
these sources is that it is difficult to get 
them interested in bricks and mortar.
The second step  interestis to de
termine what projects the donor might 
be willing to support. Although the Uni
versity is concentrating its fundraising 
on the University Center, it will accept 
gifts for other purposes from people who 
have other preferences.
The University then attempts to get 
the potential donor involved or re-involved with the school. Carter said that 
the potential lead donor has returned to 
CMU several times recently. In cases 
such as the lead donations for the Uni
versity Center, which involve potentially 
large gifts, deans, vice presidents, and 
even Cyert himself meet with the pros
pect to try to cultivate him or her.
Finally, if all goes well, the University 
reaches the fourth stage of the fundrais
ing process  investment. In this stage, 
the donor agrees to a particular amount 
of money and makes arrangement with 
the University about when the gift will 
be delivered and in what form. In the 
case of the University Center, the Uni
versity is seeking only cash gifts or gifts 
in cash-type securities and only gifts 
which will be delivered within the next 
five years.
The investment stage also includes 
the ceremonial portions of the process, 
such as officially announcing the gift and 
eventually dedicating the University 
Center or some of its sections in honor of 
the donors.

yet have it, and I dont want to go out and 
say thats a fait accompli.
Although administration officials are 
optimistic about acquiring the Naval Re
serve Center, they are not regarding the 
transition period as an easy step to take.
Theres going to be some hardship while 
[the University Center] is being built, 
said Cyert.
Student input into the planning of the 
new building is of importance, and it is 
being stressed by all parties. Mark Mittelhauser, student government president, 
and Kishore Rao, the student represen
tative to the Board of Trustees Univer
sity Center committee, are forming a 
student committee to advise the admini
stration and the Board of Trustees of stu
dent concerns.
Mittelhauser and Rao describe the pro
posed committee as an active body. Were 
looking for individuals who are inter
ested, said Rao. There will be work to 
do.
The student committee has five pri
mary goals:
 Publicizing developments in the Uni
versity Center project. Rao envisions a 
regular report to the student body, proba
bly on a monthly basis, to let students 
know whats going on.
Working with the administration on 
fundraising, specifically with Vice Presi
dent for Development Dave Maloney.
Working with Keating on planning 
and space allocation.
Developing alternatives for interim 
space.
Possibly addressing problems of fi
nancing, although Mittelhauser is not 
sure if student help is still needed with 
the Board of Trustees handling matters 
in this area.
Even though current students will not 
be here to see the project completed, Mit
telhauser feels that generating enthu
siasm will be no trouble at all. He pointed 
out that students were active and con
cerned with the University Master Plan 
last year, though they knew that they 
would not benefit directly from the proj
ect. Rao added that any students inter
ested in serving on the proposed commit
tee should contact him through ,the 
Senate office.

Tartan Senior Staffwriter
As the fundraising efforts for the Uni
versity Center continue, plans are being 
laid to make the relocation of Skibo fa
cilities as smooth as possible.
According to Vice President for Plan
ning Patrick Keating, the administraiD the midst of a brainstorming 
in an effort to find temporary 
space to house facilities and student of
fices while Skibo is being dismantled.
Such planning is still in the specula
tive stage, however; by current estimates, 
it will take approximately two to three 
years to raise the $41 million necessary 
for the center.
Even after the necessary funds are 
raised, there is a large amount of pre
liminary design and contracting work to 
be accomplished. If we had the money 
today, said President Richard Cyert, 
we couldnt start until a year to a year 
and a half [from now].
Still, the sheer magnitude of the plan
ning and development needed has 
prompted the administration to begin 
devising ways of dealing with inevitable 
problems. Now is the time to start think
ing more seriously about it, since we 
have the agreement to go ahead with the 
detailed design of the new building, 
said Keating.
As far as facilities such as student
offices and meeting rooms are concerned, 
there are currently two major options 
being considered.
The Naval Reserve building is cur
rently considered the most plausible 
solution to the shortage of space, though 
the structure itself is owned by the 
Department of the Navy. Keating said 
that while the University has for some 
time been involved in negotiations with 
the Navy for the purchase of the build
ing, no firm commitments have as yet 
been made on either side.
Nevertheless, Cyert was more opti
mistic about the prospects of obtaining 
the facility, adding that theres a good 
chance we will have that building to use 
within two years.
When and if the building is obtained, 
the problem of space would be elimi
nated. Although it is slightly smaller 
than Skibo, the Naval Reserve building 
nevertheless contains sufficient space to 
house all student organization offices 
and meeting rooms until the University 
Center project is completed. Keating said 
that the purchase of the building would 
make our life easy, but if that doesnt 
come along, then were going to struggle 
with some of these other options.
Failing such an agreement, then, the 
next plan on the table calls for dispersing 
affected facilities in t\/o locations. The 
Gym would be able to furnish a limited 
amount of space after planned renova
tions, with the Bureau of Mines build
ings fulfilling the remaining space re
quirements.
The Bureau of Mines buildings were 
purchased by the University five years 
ago from the government. Theres still a 
portion that the Federal Government is 
leasing from us by the original sale agree
ment, said Keating, and they will lease 
it for a few more years. He estimated 
that the University has already taken 
over approximately 150,000 square feet 
ofthe building, with about 50,000 square 
feet yet remaining. Were gradually 
taking over more of it, he said.
The fate of other facilities is also un
certain and rumors outnumber plans. A 
new facility comparable to Scotland Yard 
is planned, though it is still uncertain 
whether the Tartan Grill will have a 
counterpart in the University Center. 
One idea which is currently being con
sidered is the use of more food carts to 
pick up the lunchtime slack created by 
the elimination of that facility, such as 
those found in Wean Hall and GSIA.
Keating stressed, however, that such 
plans are tentative at best, as it is likely 
that the time between now and the even
tual construction date will bring sub
stantial modifications to present ideas. 
These present formulations, then, repre

Trustees make University Center 'top priority
continued from page 1
thats whats running through that 
ersons mind.
:iWe are urging him to name it after his 
(family or himself, said Cyert.
"The gift will be in cash and cash-type 
securities, so that its not going to be a 
bequest, or left in his will so we get it 
(fter he dies or anything of that kind. He 
s anxious to give his money to us as 
rapidly as possible, Cyert said.
I sense in this a real enthusiasm, 
said Cyert. Its the most enthusiastic 
Ive seen Trustees for any project, parcularly alumni Trustees. Everyone is 
onvinced that this is necessary.
We dont think that just having a fa
cility is the answer to all of the studentiife problems, said Cyert.
We think facilities can help things, 
jut we intend to continue with a vigor
ous student affairs program that really 
tries to meet the needs of students. We 
see the Center as an important ingredi
ent in improving the quality of life on 
campus, he said.
Indeed, many administrators have 
)inned their hopes of improved quality
of student life on the Center. I want to 
see a lot more student-faculty interac
tion, said Cyert. We think this center 
can facilitate that interaction.
Vice President for University Plan
ning Patrick Keating agreed. The whole 
philosophy of the building has been to 
promote and cultivate interaction among 
people, so that will be a primary objec
tive in the design.
In terms of quality of life, the key is 
the interaction between students and 
faculty in my view, said Cyert. We jiist 
need more of that.
Cyert maintains that the twoto threeyear timetable for the center is realistic. 
I know there have been these ideas that 
someone said that there was going to be 
a center in some quick period of time. I 
have always tried to be very honest and 
conservative about it. I was dragging my 
feet on the whole concept until I really 
felt we had a good shot at raising the 
money and going ahead, and that I was 
convinced we should do it. I dont want to 
promise anything before we can deliver 
it.
Cyert and Keating agree that the $41

million estimate is realistic. Weve got 
everything in this estimate  including 
the kitchen sink, said Cyert.
That was the result of the committees 
work over the summer, said Keating, 
to make sure that we had a comprehen
sive and all-inclusive estimate.
Keating expects student involvement 
in the planning stages of the Center. As 
we move ahead with the design, well 
have extensive student input, [as well as
input] from various organizations and 
groups, faculty, and various administra
tive and staff groups. These people are 
all going to have to help us design the 
building. Were going to need to know 
how to organize these spaces, how they 
should be configured, and what works 
and what doesnt work. Theres going to 
be extensive input from people who will 
use the building.
Cyert and Maloney travelled to Cali
fornia Sunday to follow up on another 
potential donation for the University 
Center campaign.
In comparison to other donations to 
the University, Cyert said the anony
mous gift was probably larger.
A major question yet to be resolved is 
the accommodation of organizations now 
occupying Skibo during the building of 
the new Center. Weve been doing a lot 
of thinking about that. I dont think 
weve got the whole answer to that, said 
Cyert.
We certainly dont have the whole an
swer to that, said Keating. The biggest 
step of course is going to be the dining 
hall in the new dorm. Thats been done 
and accomplished.
The navy building happens to be ab
solutely perfect, said Keating. It may 
become available at the right time; it has 
the right number of spaces. But we dont 
yet have it. Its clearly high on the list, 
he said.
Cyert indicated that the University is 
still exploring possibilities for interim 
accommodations. There just is nothing 
definite, he said.

11/11 SUSPICIOUS PER
SON, 10:24 pm. Campus Police 
deceived a report of a suspicious
male in the SUPA area of Ham
burg Hall A level. The person 
had entered the SUPA Lounge 
and began conversing with ap
proximately six students who 
were in the area. He was friendly 
and congenial and started dem
onstrating Yoga. After a few 
demonstrations, he asked a fe
male student to take him home 
and he offered to demonstrate 
more Yoga in exchange for other 
favors. Carnegie Mellon Police 
were immediately notified. The 
man, after being confronted by 
Campus Police, said that he was 
an oriental therapist travelling

stranded two female riders in 
Philadelphia after charging them 
a fee; he had been instructed not 
to return to campus. He departed 
and was not found.
11/16 PROPERTYDAMAGE,

ing. This rule, however, is not 
presently in effect.
SDC Films Chair Pravin Ratnam said, You can guess which 
films people will show up drunk 
for. During these films, many 
sober people as well as drunken 
people are rowdy. If people are 
not packed in the aisles during 
these films, perhaps this behav
ior will not be as much of a prob
lem.
SDC members have suggested 
searching peoples purses and 
bags for alcohol, or hiring secu
rity for the films. These solutions 
have been ruled out as too strict 
and impractical.
In general, SDC members feel 
that drunken behavior will be less
of a problem if the films are less 
crowded. Smoker said, I person
ally would like it if people stuck to 
their seats.
Mike Flynn, one of the AB films 
chairs, said, Weve asked the 
police to be there in between each 
show.... Police will issue citations 
for open liquor.
Ratnam feels that a changed 
schedule of films could also re
lieve overcrowding. The showings 
at 8 and 10 pm are the most 
crowded, with the 6 pm showing 
being the least crowded. Starting 
the first showing between 6:30 
and 7 pm with the later showings 
being pushed ahead could spread 
out the crowds more evenly 
among the four showings, Flynn 
said.

Policy revisions are coming along

office to see all changes. So far 
Sections 1 to 5 have been revised.
Old Business: The Postering 
Proposal was removed from the 
table. An issue of discussion was 
the enforcement of this proposal. 
A motion was made to amend the 
motion to five posters per bulle
tin board.
After some discussion concern
ing the pros and cons, the point 
was made that this has been ex
tensively discussed in Campus 
Affairs and three was decided on 
as the best number. The motion 
passed in a hand vote. Please see 
Appendix I for the .motion.
Points of Discussion: A com
plaint was raised about the cam
pus newspapers, specifically that 
ignorance in the newspapers leads 
to ignorance on campus, for in
stance, on the issues concerning 
flag burning and Student Activi
ties Fee.
Topics discussed included: 
whether the administration re
voked the permission granted 
concerning the flag burning is
sue; the difference between con
tingency monies and reserve
monies in the Student Activits 
Fee; and inaccuracies in specific 
cases concerning both the Tartan 
and the Student Union.
However, after a discussion on 
this and related topics it was 
decided that these types of issues 
should be discussed in the form of 
letters to the editor of either paper, 
rather than letting Senators use 
their positions as a way to ex
press their opinions.
Appendix I
Whereas there exists a problem 
with the postering of campus 
bulletin boards by student organi
zations, the Campus Affairs 
committee would like to propose 
a change in the way student or
ganizations are allowed to poster.
The proposal reads as follows:
As of January 16,1990 (start of 
second semester of 1989-90 academic year), there will be a limit
of three (3) posters per event per 
bulletin board.
This will not go into effect 
until next semester to allow a 
grace period for people to learn 
about the rule.
This ruling would help to re
duce the amount of clutter on 
bulletinboards on campus, reduc
ing the striping of bulletinboards 
with posters, reduce the need to 
tear down other organizations 
posters (although not a final solu
tion to this specific problem), and 
would also reduce the amount of 
activity fee funds needed to be 
spent on posters (less posters, 
lower cost).
A limitation of three posters 
has been taken by Greek Organi
zations on campus, and it has 
been obeyed by Greek organiza
tions. It has been successful at 
reducing the amount of tearing 
down and postering over of other 
posters.

Prejudicial treatment is
Students get
Last March, President Cyert 
faced a hostile student audience
 in the Wherrett Room and an
nounced that Carnegie Mellon 
University was indefinitely post
poning construction of the Uni
versity Center. He blamed the 
delay on aninability to raise funds 
for the project.
Students disagreed. The prob
lem, they felt, was that Carnegie 
Mellon wasnt trying hard enough 
to raise the money; as evidence, 
they poi nted to the fact that Cyert 
refused to make the Center his 
top priority.
Cyerts speech launched a flurry 
of student reaction, including the 
only front-page editorial in the 
83-year history ofThe Tartan. We 
must make the University Center 
our first priority in fundraising,
 we wrote. This issue is too impor
tant to bury.
Now, the Board of Trustees has 
given students almost everything 
we wanted. Last Monday, the 
Universitys highest decision
making body acted in closed ex
ecutive session to commit Carne
gie Mellon to building a new, $41 
million student center.
The Centers history goes back 
1 several years. In 1987, the Task 
Force on the Quality of Student 
Life released a report that said 
the only way to brighten Carnegie 
Mellons social atmosphere was to 
create a focal point for the diverse 
student life here.
Every weekend, Doherty Hall 
suffers damage by immature stu
dents who think its cool to smuggle 
alcohol into 2210 during movies. 
They fill soda cans, milk jugs, or 
anything else with alcohol. They 
drink; they get drunk; they be
come loud; they leave their gar
bage; they vomit.
Doherty 2210 is one of our main 
lecture halls, and is fitted with 
projection facilities  making it 
the best place to show movies. We 
cannot allow a few drunken indi
viduals to trash the place each 
week.
Students turn their heads be
cause they think no damage is 
being done to the room. Theyre 
wrong. Campus Police have re

Through its various incarna
tions, the Center has always in
cluded eating facilities, student 
offices, central meetingplaces, and 
areas for students to get together.

From the start, it was a highstakes proposition. The protrac

chilling effect on all other steps ...

in intended gifts. And we at The

Most of us will graduate before 
anyone sets foot in the University 
Center  but at least its going to 
happen. According to Cyert, 
groundbreaking will start within 
three years. Skibo will be replaced 
with a much bigger, more useful, 
highly ambitious building.
To all the students who refused 
to let the Center and its lofty goal 
of uniting the student body die: 
Congratulations. Youve shown 
that student-motivated change is 
possible at CMU, if we only be

ing. No one likes stepping in

If we dont take care of this prob
lem, the administration will. 
There are already proposals which 
would require AB and SDC to hire 
security officers for the movies. 
This would force them to spend up 
to $25,000 more per year to police 
the very students who fund them.
Several faculty members have 
expressed opinions that the dam
age to 2210 is a direct result of 
unsupervised activities. They 
have the impression that were an 
irresponsible group which must 
be watched over like children.
To them we say, Were sorry. 
To the students responsible, we 
say, Get your act together  
youre ruining it for the rest of us.
And we call on AB and SDC to 
refuse admission to students with 
alcohol, and to have Security eject 
those patrons who break the rules.
Editor:
Across the country, college students, 
faculty, and staff are placing extraordi
nary emphasis on human relations 
and diversity. Colleges and universi
ties are places where openness, freedom 
of expression, and the freedom to be 
ones self and explore ones goals freely 
are paramount. The freedom and inde
pendence our campus offers is central to 
many of us in choosing to be a part of 
this community.
As we all work to support this free
dom, we occasionally face bias and preju
dice  sometimes aimed at us, and 
sometimes aimed at others. While we 
still see prejudice on the campus, we all 
work hard to eradicate it in ourselves 
and in others  and to make the univer
sity a better place to live and learn.
Of all the prejudices we face, in many 
ways the most pervasive is that against 
gay and lesbian members of the commu
nity. Differences in race, gender, reli
gion, and other areas do not seem to 
impact our acceptance of others as read
ily as differences in sexuality. Perhaps 
our sensitivity to our own sexuality 
coupled with our concern for how others 
might view our own sexuality discour
ages us from supporting others with a

'While jogging through the park, a 
woman is robbed by some teenagers. 
She gets beat up pretty bad.
Fifteen minutes later, the vehicle with 
flashing lights arrives and carries her

Wrong. Shes under arrest. Shes going 
to prison in a police car.-
That would be outrageous. But thats 
what happens to people who use illegal 
drugs.
They are victimized by the harmful 
(sometimes deadly) effects of the drugs 
they ingest. And theyre victimized when 
their use of drugs brands them as out

We want our children to just say no 
to drugs and alcohol. But some of them 
wont.
For one reason or another, there will 
always be people who use illegal drugs. 
These people need help. They dont be

With the CBS special Return to Crack
I would like to share something inter
esting that happened to me last week.
I had a meeting with one of the advi
sors in the SUPA career services office 
last week. It was a fairly informal 
meeting, just a short chat for us to get to 
know each other and to get me started 
in the right direction in looking for a job 
next summer.
One of the first things the advisor 
asked me was how I was doing in my 
classes.
It was a reasonable question and I 
told her that I was doing alright.
It was what happened next that I 
found interesting. My advisor was sur
prised. It had nothing to do with my 
past academic record or any prior ex
pectations she had of me. We had never 
met and she probably didnt even know 
what my grades had been like in the 
past.
What surprised her was apparently

different sexual orientation.
We have perhaps all been raised in an 
environment which, while not outwardly 
tolerant of anti-gay sentiment, has not 
condemned it as we have negative senti
ment toward other groups. Parents have 
perhaps been more comfortable in en
couraging openness to those groups of 
which they did not fear their children 
becoming a part. Perhaps we are all more 
comfortable in displaying our openness 
to groups of which we will not likely risk 
being considered a part.
We dont know the answer. We do know 
that there are members of this commu
nity who are holding on to a strong anti
gay bias. We urge them to consider why 
someone elses sexual orientation or prac
tices would warrant this attitude. There 
are so few people in most of our lives 
whose sexual practices actually impact 
our own. It seems clear that when dealing 
with someone on an intellectual level, 
their intellect is paramount; when deal
ing with someone on an emotional level, 
their emotion is paramount; and only in 
dealing with someone on a sexual level is

Crack robs her of hobbies and delights. 
In its natural state, the human brain

Prison is a place for people who do bad

For all the abuse she heaps on her Clas

In fact, I would guess that I am not 
even having a significantly easier time 
in my classes than most people here. /
The difference, I believe, is that there 
is a myth at this school (and possibly at 
other schools as well) that if you are not 
working yourself to the point of exhaus
tion and pain there is something wrong 
with you as a student. My guess is thaj 
most students, even if they are not work: 
ing this hard and are doing well aca
demically, are afraid to admit it because 
others will think that they are not seri

I have even heard a theory that stu
dents in a particular major put off some 
of their work until the middle of the night 
because not being seen pulling allnighters causes other people to think 
they are lazy. I suspect that it is true and 
that it is not limited to one major.
The fact is that there is a lot of work

The flag burning issue...
Freedom to dissent 
is as important as 
free expression
Editor:
In light of your encouragement 
of dialogue in last weeks edito
rial, there are some notions re
garding fl ag burning worth m entioning. No matter what posi
tion a person takes on this issue, 
it is important to expose oneself 
to other viewpoints so that an 
idea which may clarify the issue 
wont be overlooked.
This country is at its best when 
people can express themselves 
without fear of retribution. Flag 
burning is a form of expression 
which forces no one to do any
thing against their will. A per
son who is offended by a burning 
flag can turn away and ignore it. 
There is a belief that burning 
the flag belittles the efforts of 
Americans who died so that we 
could honor the flag. In reality, 
they died so that we could decide 
on our own which symbols and 
institutions are worth respect
ing. They struggled to preserve 
free expression, not coerced 
idolatry.
Some citizens feel the writers 
of the Constitution didnt have 
flag desecration in mind when 
they included freedom of 
speech in the First Amendment. 
However, the Supreme Court re
membered last summer that the 
First Amendment allows the 
minority to express opinions 
which are repulsive to the ma
jority. A person who denies this 
is ignoring one of the main pur
poses of the First Amendment, 
which is to allow dissidents to 
protest the actions of their gov
ernment and to express view
points different from that of 
popular opinion.
Flag burners dont move out of 
the country because that wont 
solve this countrys problems. 
They feel that by destroying the 
flag they can bring attention to 
this countrys problems without 
infringing on anyones rights. 
Perhaps this is not a construc
tive way of protesting, but in
trinsic to a protest is doing or 
saying something which some
one else disagrees with. Thus 
telling someone how they should 
express their dissent is taking 
away the very nature of the 
protest, and no person or group 
of people is so special that they 
can do that. Therefore, one can 
be disgusted by flag burning and 
still admit that citizens of a 
democracy have a right to choose 
how to disagree with their gov
ernment.
Tolerance of other opinions 
implies security in ones own 
mind. In this case, that means 
that a citizen can be so secure in
Letters to the Editor
knowing how great their country 
is that it doesnt matter to them 
what other people think. If the 
United States is such a great 
place, then flag burners will be so 
few and far between that they 
wont matter to national security. 
While some feel that destroying 
the flag is destroying the free
doms and liberties it stands for, 
no one has the right to violently 
force others to believe that a flag 
is more than a piece of cloth. 
Furthermore, some cant help but 
believe there is something wrong 
with compulsory allegiance to
ward a flag representing this 
nation, which for four-fifths of its 
history permitted the murder of 
blacks who tried to vote and cur
rently allows one-fourth of its 
children to live in poverty.
Polls show that most Ameri
cans think desecration should be 
unlawful. Some say that since 
this is a democracy and majority 
rules, an amendment banning flag 
desecration should be passed. 
This would be a dangerous prece
dent; however, it could open the 
way for banning all forms of ex
pression which the majority of 
the public disagrees with, which 
is exactly what the First Amend
ment protects against. Signifi
cantly, it would assume that the 
government has the power to tell 
its own people how to protest. Itis 
ironic that while Communist 
countries in Eastern Europe are 
legalizing dissenting groups and 
finally allowing their citizens to 
protest in the streets, President 
Bush wants to take away a form 
of protest in the worlds foremost 
democracy.
Would he or other future presi
dents stop there? Or would they 
gradually chip away at our right 
to criticize our government and 
express dissatisfaction with its 
policies? Communicating disap
proval with our government is 
one of the checks that keep it from 
going out of control. Blind trust in 
our leaders can too easily result 
in human rights abuses and loath
some wars which go unopposed. 
The right of the people to show 
their feelings toward their gov
ernment as they see fit is the 
backbone of democracy, and 
makes that country an infinitely 
better place to live. Therefore, 
perhaps the best reason for a citi
zen not to bum their flag is know
ing they can if they want to.

Union missed ideas by 
outlining controversy
Editor:
Because we, as Americans, pos
sess the unlimited right to ex
press ourselves in any way, often 
times in the execution we do not 
get our point across to our listen
ers. This seems the case with the 
issue of the flag burning.
The way in which the Student 
Union [Vol. 5, No. 61 covered the 
story of this incident led its read
ers to total misinterpretation of 
what was going on that day. The 
writers disregarded the main ar
guments and ideas to the extent 
that all that was expressed in 
their commentary was a circus of 
fag bashing comments possess
ing no more thought or value than 
a blustery wind, to which they 
should have been left.
If they had been interested in 
informing their readers on the is
sues, as most responsible papers 
are, they would have included 
more of the discussions going on 
about the flag issue and less of 
the unintelligent, slanderous 
comments that dimply produce 
excitement and sell  for gos
sip.
By harping on these anti-homosexual comments, they deviated 
from the real, interesting, and 
thoughtprovoking issues at hand 
that could have produced, in 
themselves, a powerful article.'
The Student Union should have 
had enough journalistic integrity 
to objectively portray the entire 
picture of this incident. This 
seems to be a highly uncharacter
istic trait of the Student Union, 
judging from this article.
The whole incident was, in fact, 
a positive display of our freedoms 
of speech or expression (excludingthe slanderous remarks which 
were well within these rights, but 
not at all positive or worth re
garding in this discussion.)
People who are concerned with 
the preservation of our freedom 
of speech should welcome and 
encourage opposing opinions and 
views, such as those which ocurred at the demonstration, as well 
as expressing their own.
It is not in the Bill of Rights 
that freedom of speech is only 
guaranteed to those who agree 
with us, and after all, whats there 
to talk about but the weather if
Americans are fortunate to have 
these rights, and the people that 
care enough to bolster up the 
nerve it takes to be able to say 
what they feel, on both sides of 
this, or any, argument should be 
commended!

Union article 
missed point 
about flags
Editor:
Klein doesnt know what the 
hell hes talking about, was 
the quote from last weeks 
Student Union. Well, I wish 
Matt Ruben did, but unfortu
nately he didnt. Fighting over 
the Flag [Student Union, Vol. 
5, No. 6] was a great article 
but only half of the column 
even resembled the title.
I will be the first to admit 
that I do not like Matt Ruben, 
so when I was approached by 
him there were feelings of 
hostility. I was out of control 
on that Thursday, but let me 
also tell you I was provoked. 
Compliments for that go to 
Matt Ruben, for only an excel
lent journalist could infuriate 
me like that by asking the 
ridiculous, unrelated ques
tions to bring on an unrelated 
argument. When I am pro
voked, I can become as irra
tional as any person: gay, 
black, Jewish, etc. Heres the 
bottom line. I thinkhomosexuals are biblically, mentally, and 
morally wrong. I have never 
(nor do I plan on) bashing 
anyone. So in context of the 
sideshow , Ruben was the one 
I was talking about bashing.
CFA Fags. I said it. Once 
again I will admit fault, but 
not without another explana
tion. My roommate is a CFA 
fag, and so are three of my 
best friends and about a third 
of my fraternity brothers. I 
use it with my friends the way 
someone else might use a dif
ferent nickname, so this is the 
expression that came to mind 
when people out there were 
referring to my house as Nazis 
because of my personal opin
ion. I would think it could 
upset you if they were refer* 
ring to your friends.
So there it is, take it as an 
apology, and explanation, nei
ther, or both. Thats the way I 
really feel and if you still have 
a problem with that then it is 
nothing Id be embarrassed to 
admit to or talk about.
As for the article, not only 
did I correct Matt Ruben on 
the way to spell my last name, 
but I also gave him my phone 
number.
I was sad to see that the 
article had to rant and rave 
about the sideshow tactics 
while there was real, construc
tive debate going on inside, 
but I guess it just wasnt con
troversial enough for the Stu
dent Union.

Contra aid is the wrong answer
Editor:
OK, you can call me a left-wing
 anti-U.S.-get-out-of-CentralAmerica freak, [U.S. involve
ment with Nicaragua still neces
sary? 11/14] if you want to. I 
dont mind, if that makes you 
happy. However, I dont want to 
squeak about Marxist Ortega and
- his cohorts involvement.
I want to make some serious, 
objective statements on Nicara
gua, because I see you dont un
derstand anything about the situ
ation. Im even sure youve never 
been there, or anywhere close to 
it.
In being more objective, let me 
start by adopting the, obviously 
more neutral, term Contras, 
instead of what you call them: 
Freedom Fighters.
First of all, there does not exist 
any such division in Nicaragua 
between Sandinists and Contras. 
Moreover, there arent really any 
Contras in Nicaragua. Theyre 
based in Honduras, and operate 
in Nicaragua.
There does exist, however, a 
distinction between Sandinists 
and opposition, who as you may 
know, both participate in the free
elections in February.
I visited Nicaragua over the 
summer, but not to hang around 
with Sandinists. However, I did 
meet members and even leaders 
of the opposition. They all agreed 
on the Contra issue: the Contras 
have been the worst thing hap
pening to Nicaragua in the last 
couple of years.
Rather than undermining the 
Sandinista government, they 
drive the people into the arms of 
the Sandinists. Because who calls 
himself a Contra nowadays, was, 
more than ten years ago, one of 
Somozas repressive guards, and 
Somozas dictatorships is still seen 
as worse than what you call 
Ortegas brutal oppression. Not 
only that, but the Contras even 
give Ortega an excuse for the 
country's continuing bad eco
nomic situation.
No one knows for sure what the 
elections will bring, but I admit 
something has to change in Nica
ragua. Ten years after the revolu
tion, the Sandinists are stuck in 
an economic mud. However, the 
Contras dont have an answer, 
they only know violence and re
pression, words that have no
promise for progress, words that 
they remember from under Somoza.
The elections may not be as free 
as we, in the western world, would 
like to see, but you cannot disre
gard the fact that the situation is 
totally different from ours; not 
everybody is registered. You can 
hardly expect the elections to be 
more free than those in El Salva
dor.
At last, still a large part of the 
population, especially under the 
workers, believe in the Sandin
ists, for the good things they did 
realize in the last decade: free 
education, health care .... The 
oppuoition, on the other side, can 
be found in the middle class, the 
self-employed, who today mostly 
suffer from the economic regime.
The conclusion: STOP the Con
tra aid, whatever its form, be
cause it only makes the situation 
worse for everyone  the Sandin
ists, the opposition and especially 
the common man. Be sensible and 
constructive, not destructive.

ASA advertisement was 
clearly misinterpreted
Editor:
Apologies to those offended or 
disturbed with the ASA egg roll 
sale flyer. Our strict intentions 
were to use the Japanese ani
mation character as a focal point 
of the advertisement.
As the Asian Student Asso
ciation, we thought it appropri
ate to use authentic Asian art in 
order to sell our egg rolls. The 
woman in the poster is the main 
character in a Japanese prime
time cartoon. Our sole inten
tion was to attract the poten
tial customer in this manner. 
Thats all we wished to accom
plish. In the future, we will 
most likely continue to use 
Asian art and culture to pro
mote our events, and we feel 
this is justified.

Deadline Friday 6pm
Letter 
unfair to 
Stefano
Editor:
I am writing in response to the 
letter published last week,  Dice 
injured through Stefanos insen
sitivity [11/14], as an attempt to 
expose a few considerations dis
torted or entirely left out by the 
letter.
Let me begin by stating that the 
purpose of the evening under 
scrutiny was a Dance Marathon. 
To me this entails dancing, and 
dancing is easiest with some 
music, preferably that which one 
likes and will dance to. On that 
Saturday night, many people were 
dancing. However, when the band 
Tumbling Dice was playing, most 
ofthe crowd preferred not to dance. 
As the band played, many people, 
in fact a growing number of people, 
were expressing extreme dissat
isfaction with the material tjiat 
the band had chosen.to play, and 
quite many of them blatantly told 
me that the band sucks. This 
was unfortunate, since Tumbling 
Dice was playing musically well, 
but their selections were not pleas
ing the crowd, which was their 
purpose. I was prompted as a 
committee member to instructthe 
band that they should change 
their approach, and end the1 set 
shortly. This was an effort to, re
tain the once enthusiastic atten
dants of the event, who were cur
rently seeking the exits. J
I spoke with bassist Robert 
Smith that there was a need for 
change. I was completely mis
quoted in the article, making it 
look like I didnt care and ojily 
wanted the band to play a gbod 
one. I guess it was silly to hhve 
cared that the crowd was seeping 
out the stairwells, and if the band 
should play anything, that it 
should be good for dancing. Also, 
I did not see the bands playlist 
until the end of the first set that 
night. At that point, Robert Smith 
and I quite professionally worked 
out the next three songs that the 
band would perform after a small 
session played by the DJ. This 
three-song set was in itselfan 
extension of the time that fiad 
been allowed for the Tumbling 
Dice to perform, and it was a-di
rect effort by the committee to let 
the band play their best perform
ance dance selections. It is inter
esting that this point was left out 
by last weeks article.
The entire approach that TumblingDice tookin presenting their 
opinions was inappropriate. The 
campus newspapers main section 
is no forum to air personal re
proach, and is certainly no place 
to make a personal assault on one 
individual for his handling of a 
situation amid a hectic evening-. I 
received no phone call or otjjjier 
communication from any of the 
band members for my actions/ If 
the band was offended, a coin
plaint should not have first Ap
peared in the paper for anyone, 
whether involved with any aspect 
of the event or not, to read and 
judge.
Maybe the readers of the Tar
tan would be more interested tin 
the constructive results of the 
Dance Marathon than detractions 
from it. I think that people woijld 
be more impressed by the fact 
that two Greek organizatiops 
conceived an event that gener
ated money for charity; that we 
were able to draw a large mix of 
students from Carnegie Mellon 
and other universities under ojie 
roof for one cause for whatever 
their individual reasons; andthjat 
we provided such a broad spec
trum of audio, visual, and editjle 
entertainment that left everyofie 
pleased in some way.
Notably, all of this enjoymejnt 
occurred without alcohol. The^e 
results are far more credible ai}id 
positive for readers than one 
bands personal difficulty with one 
individual.
I thank all those who supported 
our event and who politely, si
lently, overlooked our faults. ;

Campaigns become 
dirtier every year
Art Buchwald
Dirty Eddie, campaign man
ager for Howard McClintic, was 
packing up his literature and 
campaign signs.
; I am proud of the fact that it 
was a clean political campaign, 
he told me. Race never played 
a role in the contestnot once, 
even when we said that our 
opponent went to school with 
Willie Horton.
But McClintic was white and 
so was his opponent.
All the more reason for not 
mentioning the race issue. At 
the beginning of the campaign, 
McClintic announced that he 
would not introduce color as an 
issue. With that statement, he 
made it an issue.
McClintic never made it an 
issue. His opponent, Glocken
spiel, did when he attacked 
McClintic for raising it in the 
first place.
Dirty Eddie continued, When 
we started out we decided to 
take the high road in the cam
paign.
Is that why you ran a TV 
commercial of Glockenspiel 
Jae.ating up senior citizens in a 
public park?
We felt that the voters had a 
right to know what turned 
Glockenspiel on. Was it less fair 
than the other side showing our 
guy in a raincoat flashing in 
front of a MacDonaldS?
I am curious about how you 
managed to get film of Glocken
spiel and Noriega riding in the 
same seat on the Ferris wheel. 
Its incredible what you can 
do with a computer these days. 
Dirty Eddie, I know you ran 
a clean campaign, but there are
some who feel that you spread 
stories about Glockenspiel 
which werent true.
Like what?
Like the time you said that 
he had to take steroids before 
he could go out to campaign. 
We only mentioned it when 
they claimed that McClintic was 
a compulsive gambler and bet 
on his own race. We werent 
looking for low-down things to 
say about the other side, but 
you have to fight fire with fire. 
We had so much dirty stuff that 
we didnt use.
Such as?
Glockenspiel has one of the 
highest cholesterol counts of 
anyone running for office this 
year.
Dirty Eddie, it seems to me 
that the last two weeks of the 
campaign were the worst. After 
what we saw, are you still trying 
to tell me that you ran a clean 
campaign?
Id bet my life on it. We were 
entirely issue-oriented.
Was that why you leaked the 
story about your opponent being 
the serial killer of Gladly 
Heights?
We didnt say that he was. 
We just raised the question. 
Thats what political campaigns 
are all about. If someone run
ning for office is a serial killer, 
the public has a right to be in
formed. We didnt claim that he 
was unfit for the job.
I asked him, What are you 
doing with all the stuff youre 
packing away?
Saving it for next year. Poli
ticians will pay anything in 1990 
to find a squeaky clean cam
paign manager like myself.

Battle of newspapers now at another school
A new newspaper appears sud
denly on an unprepared campus. 
The established newspaper im
mediately criticizes the upstart, 
with the editor-in-chief claiming 
that the rivals staffers need to 
learn the laws of journalistic 
ethics and integrity.
As Yogi Berra said, Its deja vu 
all over again.
This is not the story of the Stu
dent Union and The Tartan of 
four years ago, though it may 
sound like it. This battle is hap
pening down Forbes Avenue be
tween The Pitt News and the Free 
University Press.
You have to hand it to the staff 
of the FUP. Actually, you have to 
have to hand it to its staff; the 
FUP is put out by a coalition of 
Pitt groups without an editor-inStewart Levine
chief. Anyway, it outraged The 
Pitt News with its latest issue to 
provoke columns against it on two 
consecutive days last week.
The Pitt News Editor-in-Chief 
Matt Martin rail s agai n st the FUP 
in his column. Please dont mas
querade as a newspaper, says 
Martin to his competition.
A more sarcastic person may 
invoke the maxim about people in 
glass houses, but thats not my 
point. Martin may be right, but 
he sure doesnt come off well when 
he speaks his piece.
Columnist Mario Oliverio is a 
bit more prosaic. He finds pieces 
of FUP useful and announces that
he will join its staff. It makes you 
wonder after reading his work 
whether FUP wants his column. I 
hope it takes him. Oliverio al
ready bemoans losing his Pitt 
News paycheck, and I wouldnt 
want his sacrifice to be in vain.
On this side of Panther Hollow, 
its easy to take shots at both 
organizations. The Free Univer
sity Press proclaims on its front 
page that it presents Some of 
what The Pitt News will not print. 
Hmm ... seems like The Pitt News 
could put the Free University Press 
out of business with a few more 
reporters.
The FUP also proclaims that it 
is Free from advertising  and 
free to you. Perhaps its donors 
are as free with money as our 
Student Senate.
I wonder how the Free Univer
sity Press will retaliate in its next 
issue, but since they do not pub-* 
lish on a regular schedule, no one* 
can guess when that will be. And,1' 
since it is free from advertising,\ 
we can all wonder whether there i 
will be a next issue.
Maybe this whole matter will? 
die down. After all, The Tartan 
and the Student Union are now*

Thanksgiving is a time to express ones gratitude
I have always loved November 
for just one reason: Thanksgiv
ing. Memories of my aunts dining 
room, crowded with fifteen to 
twenty people present is some
thing to which I always looked 
forward. I had a long vacation 
from school, got to see my cousins 
for the first time in about eight 
months, and, most of all, I pigged 
out on a lot of really good-looking, 
good-tasting, and pleasantly-filling food.
But this year, all that is chang
ing. I am just going to eat a less 
elaborate and less crowded meal 
at home with my family. That is 
not to say that I am not going to be 
thankful for anything at Thanks
giving this year. No, I think I have 
even more to be thankful for.
Sue Abrams
To begin with, I am very thank
ful that I am alive today. There is 
so much happening all the time, 
and I am just glad to be a part of 
it.
I am thankful that Im learning 
how to master the computers here. 
Only twenty more lessons and I 
should become an advanced nov
ice.
I am thankful that the semes
ter is almost over. I honestly didnt 
know how much longer I could 
keep staying up until all hours 
trying to write computer pro
grams that refused to work.
I am thankful that it finally
started to get cold. I wondered if I 
was ever going to be able to wear 
my new winter jacket.
I am thankful that the heat is 
working in my room. Its cold 
enough outside.
I am thankful that my plants 
have ten lives, even though only 
one is remaining.
I am thankful that I know how 
to wash my clothes. I have always 
wanted a pair of pink socks.
I am thankful that someone 
invented e-mail. My regular mail
box is always empty.
I am thankful that I have not 
yet gotten blasted. I can be pretty 
mean without being intoxicated.
I am thankful that my parents 
sent me a lot of food. I was begin
ning to get tired of mystery meat.
I am thankful for 2:30 am fire - 
drills. Its always interesting to' 
see what other people wear to 
bed.
I am thankful that I live right' 
across the street from the frater-7 
nities. Now I know for sure that IJ 
am not the strangest person on3 
campus.
I am thankful that I have big 
phone bills. I love talking to my" 
family and friends.
But most of all, I am thankful 
to be going home to my family 
and friends, because home is, 
where the heart is.
Sue Abrams is a freshman pro
fessional writing major. She hopes 
everyone is as thankful as she is 
about going home.
Unfortunately, positive change is a relative thing
The work here is long and 
hard for some students
continued from page 8
here and at times people do pull 
consecutive all-nighters and work 
as hard as they claim to. But this 
level of work is not nearly as 
constant as popular myth leads 
people to believe.
People take time off from their 
work. One walk past the fraterni
ties any weekend proves that, as 
does a stop in The Tartans office 
where it is impossible to find a 
free Macintosh because of the 
popularity of a new video game.
None of us work as hard as we 
could and there is no reason why 
\Ve should. You will probably come
out ahead if, every once in a while, 
you do a little worse on a test 
because you decided to get some 
sleep.
Nobody can work at 100 per
cent capacity all the time without 
going nuts, and that is why none 
of us do. There is a myth that 
people do so because nobody will 
admit otherwise. And nobody will 
admit otherwise because the myth 
leads them to believe that they 
are the only ones.

Change is in the air and in the 
news. Things are happening that 
seemed impossible a few years 
ago. Think about it  Time ran a 
two-page photo of people stand
ing on the Berlin wall. The wall 
was being tom down by citizens, 
hacked into pieces, and carried 
away. Symbolism by the bucket.
Everywhere, newspeople are 
strainingto keep up with the pace 
of events. The world is producing 
not just the normal list of war, 
insurrection, death, and famine, 
but changes that are so atypical, 
so extraordinary, that they are 
one-of-a-kind. The western tier of 
the Warsaw Pact moving quickly 
towards freedom? Free travel 
between East and West? The be
ginnings of representative gov
ernment in parts of the world with 
no previous democratic traditions? 
The world is changing in a way 
that our children will have to learn 
about in school.
The catch is that all this change
Don Pickett
is external, outside the U.S. A 
large part of the world is trying 
to change for the better, and the 
change, while spurred on by the 
people, is also being helped by a 
government that sees it has no 
choice but to change.
Not the United States. For the 
past nine years, we have been 
beset by an ineffectual, illusionary government, one seemingly 
designed to provide the maximum 
possibility for graft and corrup
tion. Problems have been glossed 
over, set aside, until they burst 
out of control like the deficit, like 
the drug problem, and the depressingly long list of serious, ex
pensive problems we now face.
It comes to a head now, when 
the increased pace of world events, 
the palpable sense of dramatic 
change, is contrasted with the
apathy at home. Literally, the only 
thing that George has done that 
was of any consequence, the only 
thing that has had any lasting 
effect, was curtailing the freedom 
of expression with the flag burn
ing amendment.
Faced with problems, the ad
ministration has the power to try 
and address these issues in a crea
tive, effective way. But it is not us
ing this power.
The administration is throwing 
money at problems, making prom
ises, trying to please all and anger 
none. Even such a simple thing as 
banning the import of semi-auto
matic rifles was tied down in spe
cial interest pressure from the 
closet Nazis at the NRA.
Special interest groups, and a 
sense of caution completely out of 
whack with any sense of the pace 
of events in the world, have the 
administration tied in knots over 
how to react to a situation that 
literally comes around once in a
million years. It is time to act?" 
outside the bounds of historical* 
context. Its time for reality on4- 
Pennsylvania Avenue.
Stop and think about what's 
happening in the world right nowand look at us. The difference 
makes you wince at the wasted; 
opportunity.
Maybe Im asking too much,1, 
but Id like to see George stare d'l 
problem in the face and do some-, 
thing decisive. Make a decision0, 
which has no eternal delibera-H.' 
tion and worrying. The world is' 
changing, and there is a goocf, 
chance it is for the better. All the*, 
problems will not disappear, but1 
some of the major frictons from 
which they arise are being at-'- 
tacked. Washington must catch 
on, before we are left behind for-1

Women start season with two wins
Reeboks: The 
Yuppie sneaker
The most important piece of 
equipment for any athlete is 
shoes. What an athlete wears 
can mean the difference 
between winning and losing.
Recently, athletic footwear 
has taken on new significance. 
People no longer want an 
effective, durable shoe; a shoe 
that will function as a tool. The 
emphasis now is on looks, style, 
and fashion.
It all started with the Yuppie 
movement. When people began 
to accept sneakers as part of 
everyday fashion, they began 
wearing them to the office as 
well as to the aerobics class.
The Reebok proved to be the 
most popular brand because of 
its lightweight construction, 
good looks, and most 
importantly, it had a British 
flag on the side implying that it 
was a European (and thus 
trendy) import. The final 
element of such a fashion 
statement came in the choice of 
color. Even though all classic 
athletic shoes were white the 
color of choice became black. 
Minimalism had worked its way 
down to our feet.
, In fact, as with most things in 
the Yuppie movement, language 
had to be changed or 
reinvented. Just as the 
barbecue became the mesquite 
grill, what was once referred to 
as the tennis shoe/sneaker 
became specialized and was 
reborn as: the court shoe, the 
aerobics shoe, the walker, the 
running shoe, and more 
recently, the cross-trainer.
However, the trend did not 
start and end with Yuppies. 
Teenagers and even young 
children got into the act. When 
Michael Jordan reached 
superstar status, one could 
predict that he would soon start 
endorsing someones shoe. Not 
only did Nike pay him big bucks 
to plug its basketball shoe; but 
the company also invented the 
Air Jordan as added incentive.
The Air Jordan is one of the 
most significant developments 
in footwear history. First, it is 
one of the most complex pieces 
of clothing ever invented. Not 
only does it lace up, but certain 
models have velcro attachments 
which came in contrasting,
'often brash, colors. One model, 
designed by Jordan himself, 
was banned from the league 
because, as Jordan said to 
David Letterman, They aint 
got no white in em. Letterman 
answered in the now famous 
retort, Just like the NBA.
Finally, Air Jordans told 
advertisers and shoe 
manufactures all over the 
country that kids would pay 
[Over $100 for basketball shoes 
in which they would never play 
basketball. To illustrate this 
point I refer to the fact that Air 
Jordans come in sizes for 
infants. I pity the poor sales 
[clerks who have to jam the 
shoes on to the feet of two year 
olds. The kid doesnt want the 
shoes; what does a two-year-old 
know about a slam-dunk?
The only reason the kid is 
^wearing the shoes is so that 
Mommy and Daddy will look 
like trendy, Yuppie types when 
they drop the little tyke off at 
the nursery at the health club 
while they change into their 
Reeboks for aerobics class.

WALTHAM, Mass.  If the first five 
minutes of a season are a good indication of 
the year, 1989-90 looks to be very good for 
the Tartans. The women jumped out to an 
11-0 lead over Brandis University and 
never looked back.
The women opened the 1989-90 season 
with a pair of victories over University 
Athletic Association rivals Brandis Uni
versity, 65-46, and Case Western Reserve 
University, 71-39.
The future looks bright for our team. 
Were coming together nicely, said senior 
Donna Spicuzza.
The Tartans did it with a mixture of 
veterans and youngsters. Head Coach Gerri 
Seidl came out with a lineup featuring two 
seniors in the backcourt and three sopho
mores up front. While seniors Spicuzza 
and Lisa Smith anchored the team, it was 
the sophomores: Amy Buxbaum, Katie 
Fahey, and Leigh Ann Palovich, led by 
Faheys 23 points against Brandis, who 
threatened to steal the show.
Were expecting her [Fahey] to contrib
ute offensively, said Seidl. The Tartans 
need to fill the scoring void left by the nowgraduated Lisa Lightner, Beth Virgin, and
Aimee Reber.
While Faheys 23 was the most over 
the weekend, the most consistent scorer 
was Spicuzza, who pumped in 17 against 
Brandeis and 20 against Case. Also hit
ting double figures was Smith against 
Case Western with 12.
The Tartans opening spurt of 11 was 
enough of a cushion against the Bran
deis Judges to carry them through the 
game. Midway through the first half the 
second unit came in for CMU and held 
Brandeis at bay while the starters rested. 
The Judges never got any closer than 10, 
shooting only 27 percent from the floor 
as the Tartans cruised to a 65-46 vic
tory.
It was more of the same against Case 
Western. The Spartans scored the initial 
basket, but little else. Case turned the 
ball over 39 times and was never in the 
game. Carnegie Mellon walked away 
with a 71-39 win.
Due to a large amount of travel that 
UAA teams face, Carnegie Mellon (and 
other conference teams) started league 
play last weekend instead of having a 
traditional January start.
I wish that we could get a few games 
under our belt before we start into the

WALTHAM, Mass.  The mens basket
ball team should hope that its future is 
brighter than what this weekends play 
indicated.
The Tartans dropped their opening games 
against University Athletic Association 
rivals Brandeis University, 81-78, and Case 
Western Reserve University, 85-74. How
ever, they discovered that freshmen Kenyatte Mason and Charlie Connors, and 
sophomores Chris Dobbs and Philip Bronner may be ready to lead the team into the 
90s.
Once these guys get more playing time, 
theyll be a good team.... Id like to see us at 
the end of the year, said head coach Larry 
Anderson.
However, right now the Tartans are an 
inconsistent team. The Tartans had prob
lems turning the ball over, missing oppor
tunities to rebound, and playing poorly away 
from home.
Some bright spots shone over the week
end. Senior captain Chris Luckett exploded 
for 30 points against Case Western and 
Dobbs added 18 against the Spartans.
Mason led the Tartans against Brandeis 
with 14.
CMU started strong against Branded, 
taking an early 27-22 lead, but turnovers : 
in the first half let the Judges in the game. 
Brandeis went on an eight-point tear to 
take the lead, and held a 40-39 edge at 
halftime.
Fouls proved to be Carnegie Mellon^ 
undoing in the second half. Three of the ! 
teams rebounders  Luckett, Connors, 
and Mason were each saddled with four ; 
fouls, and the Judges were sent to the foul-. 
line 23 times. Free throws were the differ-" 
ence in Brandeis 85-74 win.
Against Case Western Reserve Univer^i 
sity, momentum and emotion ruled the 
day. The Tartans jumped out to a quick^ 
20-8 lead eight minutes into the first half.,; 
However, the CMU defense then disap-,., 
peared entirely. The Spartans outscoijedg 
Carnegie Mellon 18-1 to build a 26r21^, 
lead with a minute remaining in the half^ 
but steals by Bronner and Robert Sechan~> 
led to two quick scores in the final minute 
to close the Case Western lead to two.

Future looks bright for swimmers after a strong opening

Carnegie Mellons swimming teams found out what they 
could do at the Westminster relays on Friday when the 
mens team finished third and the womens team finished 
fourth (both out of six teams) and managed to set two new 
school records in the process.
The mens team finished further ahead than expected, 
behind Division II Edinboro and Westminster College. 
They also beat their biggest rival in the Presidents Ath
letic Conference, Grove City. Senior Pat Hensler, junior 
Paul Moran, and sophomore Brian Zimmerman were noted 
. as having good races on Friday.
According to Hensler, co-captain of the team along with 
senior Ward Eldred, It seems right now that were on the 
right track.
Hensler believes that the mens team might have a relay 
and a few individuals qualify for nationals. He also be
lieves some individual girls may qualify as well.
One of the womens team records set Friday was in the 
800 yard freestyle relay. Swimming for Carnegie Mellon 
were senior Francesca Crannell, sophomore Glynis Frost, 
sophomore Debbie Madsen, and senior Tiffany Picker
ing. Freshman Jo Wollschlaeger, who is co-captain with 
Pickering, set the other record in the first leg of the 
3X100-yard breastroke.
Since the womens team has only been in existence for 
five years, the records have not been substantiated yet, 
but Crannell believes the 800 freestyle relay can go to 
nationals this season.
Wollschlaeger commented that she was excited about 
having a new head coach, Bruce Bronsdon.
Taking into account the performances and the length 
of the contest (six hours, including warmup) Bronsdon 
said, overall we had a pretty solid meet.
Since this is Bronsdons first year as head coach of the 
Tartans, he cannot look back farther than last years reFall season ends brightly for crew team

Holiday depression strikes students
' By SHEILA SKAFF
v 'Tartan Staffwriter
Its the most wonderful time of 
the year...
For some.
For others, the holiday season 
can be a devastating and destruc
tive nightmare.
Depression is a very real part of 
the holiday season. It creeps up 
on people of all situations, strik
ing at the first sign of Christmas 
lights andjolly Santa Clauses and 
lingering until the final verse off 
Auld Lang Syne. For some who 
experience depression, it leaves 
With the bitter January cold. For
the less fortunate, it means never 
seeing another January.
It is a well known fact that 
suicide rates rise every holiday 
season, which proves that people 
are more emotionally vulnerable 
at this time of year. The reasons 
for this vary  sometimes de
pression is triggered by something 
as simple as a lack of money to 
buy presents; other times, the loss 
of a loved one can trigger emo
tions that seem too heavy to bear.
There are some characteristic 
signs of depression that can be 
easily missed by friends and 
family due to the spirit of the 
season. On a generalized scale, a 
depressed person will experience 
a lowering in spirits, difficulty in 
sleeping, loss of self-esteem, and 
loss of perspective.
On a more specific scale, some 
tell-tale signs are fatigue, loss of 
energy, desire to avoid people, 
lowered sexual desire and ability, 
poor appetite and weight loss, hy
persensitivity, fearfulness and 
irritability, and physical com
plaints without any diagnosable 
cause. Rarely do these symptoms 
occur all together, since only one
sign is usually prominent in a 
troubled person.
Its hard to say what triggers 
depression, as it varies from per
son to person. Holidays empha
size being with loved ones, so it is 
easy to see that those without 
anyone to love will feel slighted 
and lonely. Even those with a 
loving family or lots of friends 
may go home to find themselves 
changed somewhat, and not un
derstanding exactly why.
Students from broken homes 
may find it hard to balance time 
and energy when at home; others 
may have experienced the death 
of a family member or friend and 
may feel there is no sense in cele
brating without that person.
Just as individual as the rea
sons for depression are the cures. 
It is important for a depressed 
person to understand that he is 
not alone and that there are oth
ers who are feeling the same. 
Crisis centers are open through
out Christmas for students who 
feel that they cannot cope.

Hockey ends with wins
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon hockey 
club finished play for the se
mester last weekend with a pair 
of victories. In the season finale 
against the University of Pitts
burgh, CMU dominated early 
on offense and cruised to a 6-3 
win.
The Tartans spotted the 
Panthers a 1-0 lead early in the 
game before scoring six unan
swered goals. The Tartans de
fense held out from there, de
spite a pair of goals by Pitts 
Tony Travato. Tartan goalie 
John Kerber stopped 23 shots 
in the winning effort.
The Tartans offense was led 
by Eddie Kilduff, who scored 
twice within one minute, and 
added a third goal later to 
complete the hat trick. Dave 
Collins scored twice and Dick 
Hanson added a goal as the 
Tartans chased Pitt goalie Russ 
Hugo from the game halfway 
though the second period.
The previous days game 
against IUP showcased great 
goaltending by sophomore 
goalie Dave Sealfon, who 
stopped 40 of 43 shots in the 
Tartans 43 victory.
Again, the Tartans gave up a 
goal before getting the offense 
in gear. Kilduff scored twice in 
an eight-second span to give 
the Tartans the 2-1 lead. Craig 
Palli added a goal with 3:41 
left in the first period to give 
the Tartans a 31 advantage.
IUP scored halfway through 
the second period to pull close, 
but Chris Galvin scored on a 
blistering slapshot to push the 
lead back to two goals. IUP 
added a third period goal with 
less than seven minutes to go, 
but were unable to come up 
with the equalizing goal.
The game was the last of the 
semester for the Tartans, as a 
Saturday game against John 
Carroll was bumped from the 
schedule. CMUleads the West
ern Pennsylvania Collegiate 
Hockey Association.

The Tartans closed within two 
to 78-76 with 43 seconds remain
ing, but Spartan Ed Saxon stole 
an errant pass and brought the 
ball the other way for a lay up to 
push the lead to four. One free 
throw made it five. Case went on 
to win, 81-78.
The loss showed several weak
nesses that the Tartans will have 
to quickly address. Most notably, 
turnovers and foul trouble were 
the culprits. We need to work on 
handling the press better, said 
Anderson.
The Tartans opened the season 
against conference opponents to 
accommodate a 14-game league 
schedule which includes flights
to several cities. They begin the 
home season tonight against local 
rival Point Park College and con

against University of Rochester.
The Tartans were picked to fin

champion Emory University was 
picked to win the conference.

The Gym Wish List Even Santas elves would be stumped with this one
I'py ANIL GOKHALE
''Tartan Staffwriter
;; The Christmas season is fast 
approaching and I pondered, 
1 What would be an ideal gift that 
the University could present stu!! dents with? The bulb in my mind 
i'lit as I came to the realization 
'that our gym needs serious help. 
j| Wouldnt it be nice if renovations 
!| could be made to the dilapidated 
\\ dunghouse called Skibo Gymnasium? I proceeded to ask memlibers of the athletic staff what 
!* they envisioned in their dream 
5 gym. The following is a wish list 
that Santa would be frightened 
by, consisting of the many ideas 
'/ that they produced:)\it
jj l. Build new raquetball courts
Coach Larry Anderson, head 
1! mens basketball coach who 
! teaches a class in raquetball, 
ii estimates the size of the courts 
{j we have now as 15 feet high, 15 
.| feet wide, and 30 feet long. The 
1 actual size should be 20x20x40.
This lack of court size produces 
ii a hazard: being hit by the high 
I! speed projectile. Anderson stated 
j that one was guaranteed to get a
doughnut playing on the Carne
gie Mellon courts, meaning the 
doughnut-shaped swelling pro
duced when being stung with the 
racquetball.
2. More space for the weight 
room
The weight room has made 
some definite improvements in 
the gym facilities, but the prob
lem of limited space arises con
tinuously.
Another drawback in the weight 
room is the floor. It consists mostly 
of protrusions and indentations, 
so the mishap of tripping is a 
common, embarrassing occur
rence. But the biggest problem is 
twofold: finding a spot to exer
cise, especially near a mirror, and 
searching for the desired weights.
Once this is finally accom
plished, one has the problem of 
preventing others from stealing 
the prize. If one dares to leave his 
or her territorial domain, say to 
go to the drinking fountain (which 
is also in bad condition due to 
lack of water pressure), one may 
come back to find ones area has 
been conquered. So the cycle must 
begin again: find a spot to exer
cise and find the desired weights.
We need to increase the size of 
the weight room and to provide 
more and better equipment.
3. Update the equipment pol
icy
Something has to be done about 
the equipment policy. One, why 
in the world cant someone be there 
to distribute sporting goods on 
the weekends? A full time equip
ment manager is a necessity.
Two, its time to get rid of the 
antiquated materials. An ex
ample is the racquetball raquets. 
The raquets stringing have zero 
tension and their frames are 
made of pliable plastic.
4. Parking areas around the
gym
5. Renovate the locker rooms
The locker rooms need some 
major makeovers, especially the
,saNPlWn tn 2i ltvi te Cils1Mntslr 
vsaNP 2i hMPi ns ngi PtNMmtPMniP 
Palbgsari vMNNiP dut2s
women s area.
6. New swimming pool
On intramural director Earl 
Bird/s list is a swimming pool 50 
meters long and 25 meters wide, 
with plenty of lanes available not 
only for the varsity swim team to 
practice, but also for recreational 
swimmers.
7. A gym with more courts and 
facilities
Birdy would also like to see 
Carnegie Mellon build another 
gym, so that a total of eight courts 
would be available to accommo
date the many teams that partici
pate in IM basketball.
Birdy would also like to see the 
construction of an auxiliary gym 
with an area for aerobics, more 
extensive facilities for weight 
training, a fencing room, and six 
lanes for bowling.
8. A concession area j
9. A multipurpose gym
Anderson would like to see.! a 
multipurpose gym that would 
provide an area for varsity teams 
to practice indoors if stormy 
weather prevented outside prac
tice.
10. Dome the stage
Another one of Andersons ideas 
is to carpet, furnich and put, a 
glass dome over the stage in ,the 
gym in order to provide an area 
for distinguished individuals. This 
would allow important people, 
such as the president of CMU, to 
observe varsity sports compete.
fli11. Build a pressbox
Anderson would also like t&sjpe 
a pressbox in the gym for play-byplay and for filming of the games.

Theta Xi takes IM majors soccer title
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor
IM soccer action this season 
has come to a close with some 
surprise endings.
The Real Mellons, who have 
won the majors title for the 
past five years, were finally 
dethroned. Theta Xi did the 
honors in impressive fashion. 
The final score was 51.
The Mellons were suffering 
from a hole-filled roster in 
Thursdays match-up, having 
to fill in the gaps with several
substitutes, which is one of the 
culprits in the loss.
Theta Xi built a comfortable 
3-0 spread to lead it in to the sec
ond half. An early goal in the first 
half started the scoring. Theta Xi 
was able to withstand a formi
dable Mellons attempt at a quick 
comeback to maintain its lead and 
eventually build it to 3-0 at the 
half.
The Real Mellons then came on 
strong with an early second half 
goal to cut Theta Xis lead to two, 
but the comeback was brief. Theta 
Xi scored two more goals to secure
its championship win, ousting 
the Mellons from their fiveyear claim on the title.
In intermediate action, the 
graduate students of MEMS 
and their Ledges United team 
beat the ATO Wolfpack for the 
title. ATO, undefeated in the 
regular season and the play
offs, suffered a 5-1 defeat to 
the Ledges, who were 2-2 on 
the regular season.
The tables were turned in 
this final game; the Ledges lost 
to ATO previously in the seacontinued on page 12

artan Staffwriter
Everybody likes to do it beuse its a campus service and it 
lites some of the organizations, 
dTedRalphs, director of Theta 
second annual Basket Bucks 
sketball tournament, held on 
riday and Saturday nights.
Fourteen teams participated in 
this years tournament, represent
ing many fraternities and other 
campus organizations. Some of 
the non-Greek organizations were 
Spirit, GSIA, SDC, and SUPA.
One of Saturdays highlights 
was the game between the CMU 
All-Stars,comprised of players 
from each participating team, and
the Department of Public Safety/ 
Liquor Control Board.
Ralphs said that they invited 
the LCB to play last year and that 
they wanted to play again this 
year. He added that the LCB/ 
CMU game is good for Greek and 
CMU public relations because it 
shows the public another side of 
the Greek system.
The All-Stars eventually came 
out ahead and Spirit won the 
championship, defeating ATO in 
the process.
With entrance fees from the 
teams and raffle ticket sales, the 
organizers expect to raise between 
$2000 and $3000 to benefit the 
National Multiple Sclerosis Soci
ety.
However, Ralphs was not sure 
if the fraternity will sponsor 
Basket Bucks again next year. 
He said that they would have to 
raise more money and have more 
corporate sponsors if they are to 
repeat the'toumament.

Safety; Spirit defeats ATO in Basket Bucks Tournament
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Features Editor
Last Saturday, the LCB was on 
campus ag&in, but this time they 
were playing basketball in the 
Skibo Gymnasium against the 
Greek All-Star team to help raise 
money for Multiple Sclerosis. 
Helping out the LCB were mem
bers of Department of Public 
Safety.
The Greeks started the game 
with a couple of quick shots and 
from that point on, the LCB/Dept. 
Public Safety were not able to 
catch them. The game turned out 
to be a blowout with a final score
of 43-23. the high scorer for the 
Greek was Ron Suvak, from the 
Baloris team, with 21 points.
The rest of the Greek All-Stars 
are: Paul Brinsky, of ATO; Jason 
Daudy, of Balouris; Greg Orrill, 
of SDC; Michael Petrich, of Theta 
Xi; Kerry Skolkin, of SAE; and 
Michael McGuire, of Theta Xi.
For the main feature of the 
night, ATO met Spirit on the bas
ketball court in the final game of 
the Basket Bucks tournament. 
Both teams had defeated two 
other teams to advance to the 
final game.
Spirit took the lead with a foul 
shot by John Simon and they
never looked back. ATO kept it 
close for the first four minutes 
with a score of 4-6 by the halfway 
mark of the first quarter. Bill 
Jones, the second highest scorer 
with 19 points, added to Spirits 
lead by hitting three consecutive 
baskets. ATO finally got back on 
the scoreboard with a basket by 
Brian Lippert. By the end of the 
first quarter ATO had cut the tenpoint Spirit lead down to eight.
The second quarter opened with 
two fast breaks and four points by 
Barry Franklin, the high scorer of 
the game with 30 points. Spirit 
quickly took another ten point 
lead with the score of 24-14. Again
ATO attempted a comeback and 
again they failed to pull it off. The 
closest they came was a threepoint deficit. At the halftime, 
Spirits lead was twelve points. !
The third quarter opened with 
Spirit increasing their lead even 
more. With 2:29 left in the third, 
Sam Trinch and Dana Only were 
ejected for starting a fight. By the 
end of the third it was apparent 
that Spirit would win. They had 
increased their lead to 15.
In the fourth quarter, ATO did 
manage to stage a small come
back, but it was too little, too late. 
The final score was 78-68 with 
Spirit being victorious.

The story, the whole story, and nothing but the story

oast, a story from the Album Timm ov lm a TjBnJMs
ar in.ob Mark Donnelly, the leader of the Gossamer Thread, tells the 
tory of The Dancing Man written by Ruth Bernstein.
By JILL DENESVICH
Tartan Staffwriter
Once a long, long time ago, 
there lived a very old, very wise 
man. And this very old very wise 
man loved stories, all kinds of 
stories. He wanted to collect all of 
the stories, songs, poems, and 
dreams, from all over the whole 
world and put them in one place.
So he built a giant web which 
floated above the clouds and just 
below the stars. And you know, 
that web caught and trapped all 
of the songs, stories, poems, and 
dreams, from all over the world. 
So whenever that very old very 
wise man wanted a story, all he 
has to do was to pull down the web 
and take one out.
This is the story that Gossamer 
Thread, Carnegie Mellon 
Universitys storytelling troupe, 
uses to open each and every one of 
their performances. Throughout 
their performances, they pull their 
stories out of the giant web.
Mark Donnelly, an English/ 
Literature major, started the 
storytelling troupe at the end of 
April, and they began by per
forming on campus. The stories 
they tell range from Fairy Tales 
to holiday stories to African sto
ries. Also, Donnelly wrote the 
story of the wise, old man who 
loved stories specifically for the 
storytelling troupe.
It is a flexible type of enter
tainment, Donnelly said, all 
depending on the type of stories 
that are told. The group seems to 
be especially fond of telling sto
ries to children. In addition to 
performing at libraries, private 
parties, the Carnegie, and retire
ment homes, they have told sto
ries to the daycare center on
campus.
Mark Donnelly commented 
"... after a stressful week of doing 
homework it really is relaxing to 
make a little kid laugh about a 
story.
Saturdays extremely entertain
ing performance in the Wherrett 
Room was a cooperative effort 
between Gossamer Thread and 
Storytellers Unlimited, a local 
group of storytellers formerly 
called The Pittsburgh Storytell
ers. The students from Gossamer 
Thread that performed were Mark 
Donnelly, and sophmores Mary 
Tyler and Russell Lehrer.
The Dancing Man by Ruth 
Bernstein was told by Donnelly. 
It was the story of a boy that 
started out with a dream of 
dancing from village to village, 
even as far as the southernmost 
sea. Joseph, the little boy, was 
portrayed by Donnelly as being 
an innocent orphan staring in 
wonder as the world danced 
around him. He watched the trees 
sway, the waters lap, and the 
leaves rustle. One day, a strange 
man came into the villiage and 
danced in front of him. Donnelly 
gracefully danced on the stage 
and ended with a flourish. He 
said, I am theDancingMan, and 
I have a gift for you. Then, the 
Dancing Man disappeared in the 
wind, but leftapair of silver shoes. 
Donnelly continued the rest of 
the story capturing the audience 
with the tale of Joseph, the or
phan, as he aspired to become the 
next Dancing Man.
Tyler related a version of Hans 
Christian Andersons The Ugly 
Duckling. She made the wellknown tale much more personal 
and poignant as she showed the 
audience what life was like as the
ugly duckling. She used her en
tire body when telling the story 
and really looked like the mother 
hen, the cat, the ugly duckling, 
and the graceful swan.
The Day Dad Made Toast, 
from the album Free to be a Fam
ily, was told by Lehrer. It was a 
change of pace from the folk sto
ries and fairy tales. Lehrer 
changed his voice to play five very 
distinctive members of a family. 
He showed the ironies of the 80s 
man and how far equal rights has 
to go, which made a funny story.
Each story teller had his or her 
own special way of telling stories.
Some added singing, others added 
dances, but all of the performers 
created a very special atmosphere 
for their stories.
In a time when life has become 
so hurried, storytelling is almost 
a lost art. It was good to see that 
there are still people left who 
simply enjoy telling stories.
Gossamer Thread meets twice 
a week, performs at least once a 
week, and they perform in Scot
land Yard every third Wednes
day of the month. Without a doubt 
this storytelling group provides a 
unique form of entertainment to 
a variety of people.

Amanda Chisner, amateur busybody, solves yet another murder
' By JASON LEE SMITH
Tartan Staffwriter
The following radio script was 
written late at night, after watch
ing a twelve hour long Murder 
She Wrote I Miss Marple Myster
ies marathon on TV. No further 
explanation is needed.
Announcer: And now, Sludge, 
makers of high-quality industrial 
waste for over fifty years, bring 
you another thrilling episode of 
Amanda Chisner  Amateur 
Busybody. In last weeks episode, 
Dirk Malign, the wealthy indus
trialist, was found murdered in 
Amanda Chisners living room. 
The police suspect young George 
Headstrong of killing Dirk, but 
Amanda, having taught George 
in Sunday School, is convinced 
that he could not have done it. 
i [The background noises should 
identifythis scene as takingplace 
! in the city morgue. Youll need a 
' clever sound man.]
Police Chief Jacobs: Well,
gee, Bl Chisner, thanks for all 
your help examining the body, 
but the police will take over from 
here.
Amanda Chisner: Stuff and 
nonsense, Police Chief Jacobs, all 
Ive done is establish time of death, 
done a blood type, and performed 
an autopsy. There are a few more 
tests Id like to run, just to ease 
my mind.
PCJ: Still, Ms. Chisner, I re
ally wish youd wait and let some
one qualified examine the body 
first.
AC: Poppycock! Need I remind 
you of the extensive medical ex
perience I got when I worked as a 
candy striper? I got to be as good 
as the doctors in the hospital. 
Why, Im sure that patient I oper
ated on wouldnt have died if they 
hadnt interrupted me.
PCJ: I sure wish youd go have 
a talk with Doc Samuels some
time, Ms. Chisner.
AC: Pish-tosh, why would I 
want to talk to Dr. Samuels. Hes 
a psychiatrist and doesnt know 
the first thing about autopsies.
PCJ: Yes, well...Why are you 
doing these tests, anyway? Weve 
already got the culprit, George 
Headstrong, in custody.
AC: Fiddle-faddle. Are you 
really willing to arrest an inno
cent boy, merely on the circum
stantial evidence that he had a 
motive to kill Dirk Malign, was 
found standing over Maligns body 
with a smoking gun, was the only 
person who had access to the 
murder weapon, claims he killed
Malign, and had his name writ
ten in blood on the carpet by the 
deceased?
PC J: Well, when you put it like 
that, my case seems weak. But 
unless you can come up with 
another victim, I mean suspect, 
Im going to have to keep Head
strong in custody.
[door opens]
Jessica Fitzimons: Oh, excuse 
me, am I interrupting anything?
PCJ: Oh, hello, Jessica 
Fitzimons, what brings you down 
here?
JF: Oh, you know me, Police 
Chief Jacobs, every Saturday, rain 
or shine, I like to come down and 
look at the bodies. I guess Im 
what youd call a morgue buff. 
AC: Are you sure theres not 
some other reason you wanted to 
visit the morgue?
JF: Excuse me, have we met? 
AC: Are you sure you didnt 
know [pause] him! [organ sting] 
JF: Uh, no, not that I know of. 
Who are you?
AC: Its finally beginning to 
make sense, Police Chief Jacobs. 
George only wenttojail to protect 
someone else. The real murderer 
is his secret lover [pause] Jessica 
Fitzimons! [organ sting]
JF: Police Chief Jacobs, who is 
this woman?
AC: How do you explain this 
scandalous photograph of the two 
of you, in your bedroom, which I 
took two nights ago? [organ sting] 
JF: Thats not me!
AC: Nonsense, you killed Ma
lign because [pause] he wasblackmailing you! [organ sting] While 
rummagingthroughyour garbage 
this morning, I found this [pause] 
blackmail note, [organ sting] Its 
not in Maligns handwriting, and 
its utterly illegible, but it un
doubtedly is a blackmail note.
JF: Who is this Malign, guy? 
And what could he possibly have 
to blackmail me with? I just moved 
to town a week ago.
AC: Why, nothing, except 
[pause] the fact that you and your 
husband, Ted, arent really mar
ried! [organ sting] I was looking 
through the records department 
at City Hall, last week, and 
couldnt find your marriage cer
tificate.
JF: Of course not, we were 
married out of state. Besides, my 
husbands name is Larry, not Ted.
AC: Thats as good as a confes
sion any day. Take her away, Po
lice Chief Jacobs!
PCJ: You better come with me, 
Miss. Ive found that in cases like 
this, whatMs. Chisnerthinks has 
happened is usually pretty near 
to the truth, a lot of the time, [to 
AC] Well, Ms. Chisner, it looks 
like you helped us solve another 
one.
AC: Think nothing of it, Police 
Chief Jacobs. I often wonder what 
you bumbling imbeciles on the 
police force would do if it wasnt 
for all of us amateur detectives
who do your jobs for you.
PCB: I dont know, Ms. Chisns 
I dont know. But I do knowthi. 
have been a damn sight m0 
murders around here since y, 
moved into town, [theme up) 
Announcer: Thats it for ; 
other spine-tingling episode 
Amanda Chisner  Amah 
Busybody. Tune in next 
when well hear Amanda say: 
AC: Ill now reveal to you w 
killed James Worthington.
James Worthington: Wail 
minute, Im not dead.

ECHO sets out to save the environment
ByPAULALLOCCA
Tartan Staffwriter
Founded by freshmen Mindy 
Oubin and Helen McRae, ECHO, 
the Ecological Conservation and 
Humanitarian Organization, is a 
grass roots organization deal
ing with environmental and hu
manitarian issues through pub
lic celebration on special occa
sions, group discussion, seminars, 
and lectures. The group oper
ates on two main principles: edu
cation, and simply makingpeople 
care.
The top issues on ECHOS 
agenda include housing, deple
tion of the ozone layer, and haz
ardous waste contamination.
Still in its fledgling state, ECHO
already has several events 
planned. The first involves the 
buying of 100 acre plots of forest, 
to protect them from developers.
However, the largest planned 
event is involvement with the 
national ecological project, Earth 
Day 1990. Scheduled for April 22, 
Earth Day is strongly rooted in 
the belief that people can work 
together to obtain tremendous 
results. This nationwide celebra
tion realizes that college students 
are vital sources of knowledge, 
activism and energy, and is tiying 
to rally support from groups like 
Carnegie Mellons ECHO.
The biggest problem facing 
ECHOS founders is a very posi
tive one. The group has received 
such a large response that it is
falling behind in paperwork 
organization. More than 
CMU students have alrea 
joined. ECHO is also the ba 
group" in the Pittsburgh areal 
Earth Day 1990, an area th 
covers over 3,500 schools. Ho 
ever, many of ECHOS organij 
tional difficulties should be all 
viated when funding from tl 
Student Senate is received.

A Persons Opinion
Flag burning has been a point 
of controversy for the last sev
eral months. The questions 
ranged from, should it be le
gal? to is it ever appropriated
On November 9, Jessica Caplan, a junior art student, 
planned to burn eight flags, 
including an American one. The 
incident was stopped by Cam
pus Police before any flags were 
burned. This brought the flag 
burning issue closer to campus 
than ever before. The question 
has been a battle over freedoms 
that our country grants us ver
sus the respect we should pay it 
for that freedom.
As time wore on, three groups 
of thought became apparent. 
There were the flag burners, 
anti-flag burners, and those that 
felt flag burning should be legal 
but felt that it was stupid.
We went out and asked sev
eral people what they felt about 
burning the flag in general, and 
how they felt about the attempt 
to burn an American flag on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus.

I think that a nation that bases 
itself on freedom should be able to 
bum its own flag. If were not 
strong enough as a nation to 
uphold our own flag burning, then 
whats the point?
Aun Ting Lim

Well, Im not an American, but 
if a person has a good reason for 
it, she should be allowed to do it. 
I probably wouldnt do it. Not that 
I wouldnt because its morally 
wrong, but I have no reason to.
Richard Koehler 
Senior CIT
I think that flag burning should 
be against the law because its 
just grandstanding.... I think she 
[Jessica Caplan] was doing it for 
attention because ... she seemed 
to feel guilty about it in the way 
that she was explaining it and 
asking permission for it. Granted, 
you have the freedom to express 
yourself, maybe even in burning 
the flag, but I also have the free
dom to disagree against burning 
the flag.
Terence Ross 
Sophmore CFA
I dont think its really neces
sary as an art piece. I think that 
it was really a gimmick because 
youre going to get a big reaction, 
especially on a campus like this. I 
really dont feel it was appropri
ate. I also dont think it should be 
illegal.7

I think that from a safety is

In terms of the actual constitu

fine. Im not concerned at all.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon  21 November 1989
The mysterious myth of the ships bow becomes uncovered
By heAn jl bnIcIffhc
fartan Asst. Features Editor
I was wandering along the Cut 
one bright and sunny Pittsburgh 
jay (I was suprised to see the sun 
too), when a strange thought 
entered whats left of my mind.
, You see, a few years ago I had this 
frontal ... but I digress. I quietly 
, pondered this idea, running over 
its strong points, its weak points, 
its sharp points, till I had quite a 
few cuts on my tongue.
Finally I said to myself, Self, I 
.said, its really amazing how
 many wonderful traditions,
. myths, fables, legends, and regu
lar silly stuff exist on this cam
pus, and really disheartening how 
many people are really aware of 
them; really. Lets face it, we 
-.(meaning myself and I) walk past 
tons of interesting things every
day on our way to class.
Well, I knew right then and 
there that something had to be
 done. Just imagine how much 
ground could be gained by the 
dark, murky, obscure, tenebrous
; and not-so-bright forces of evil if
the entire campus went about its 
daily activities oblivious to the 
wonders around it.
So the two of us decided to take 
up our crosses and to spread the 
word to the ignorant and misin
formed students on this campus, 
not to mention those who were 
still in the dark.
So I asked myself, Where 
should we begin?
How about the Ships Bow? 
replied myself.
So be it.
The story begins many many
years ago when our venerable 
father, Andy Carnegie (pro
nounced Car-ne-gie, for those of 
you who mispronounce it 
Car-negie), decided to build a 
university to be known as 
Carnegie Tech.
Andy had this thing for boats. 
They reminded him of his child
hood in Scotland where he used to 
play with his little tugboat in his 
little tub. So Andy, who was get
ting pretty old and entering his 
second childhood, decided to ha ve 
his new university modeled after, 
you guessedit, a boat. A boat with 
which he hoped to launch stu
dents off on the ultimate journey 
of knowledge, and at the same 
time rake in lots o bucks from 
tuition. So the engineers, the 
architects, and the guys with the 
funky hardhats did just that: 
they designed a ship-shaped uni
versity.
First you have Hamerschlag as 
the helm and the crowsnest (and 
you wondered what the tower was 
for). Next, you have Wean off the 
starboard bow, not Klingons as 
was rumored some years back.
Volunteer Network provides opportunities 
for students concerned about others
By ERIC J. MCANALLEN
^Tartan Asst. Features Editor
It brings you back to reality. 
When youre here [at school], you 
dont think about people not hav_ing enough food to eat, because 
you just take your card to Kiltie, 
said Resident Assistant Rebecca 
Powers about student volunteer 
work at the Jubilee Kitchen.
Powers, along with five other 
RAs, is part of the Volunteer 
Network created last fall by the 
Housing Office. The networks 
purpose is to provide volunteer 
opportunities for residence life 
students.
Along with the Jubilee Kitchen, 
the network provides volunteers 
for organizations all through the 
surrounding community, includ
ing the Bradley Center, the Can
cer Institute, and the Rehabilita
tion Institute of Pittsburgh.
Around Christmas time, the
network will decorate the Hous
ing Offices tree with ornaments 
representing the names ofthe chil
dren who live in a local womans 
shelter with their mothers. Any
one can come in and take an orna
ment off of the tree, then return a 
wrapped Christmas gift for that 
child. Their hope is that each child 
will receive a small gift.
Recruitment for these activi
ties is through word of mouth, 
RAs, and publicity on campus. 
However, it is not overly adver
tised because of the sheer magni
tude of a full scale volunteer or
ganization.
According to Susanne Ferrin, 
area coordinator for Morewood 
Gardens and head of the Volun
teer Network, If it were to get too 
big, it would need an entire office 
to coordinate it.
Unfortunately, some volunteers 
are left without work because of 
tight scheduling and transportaPeDDerom Pizza (out of ten)

The Pizza Tasters devour Hals Pizza
By JON SLENK, BARRY 
BRUNITT, KYM CHARIN & 
MATT MCK3SSOCK
Tartan Staffwriters
Chomp! Chomp! Chomp!
This week we reviewed Hals 
Pizza. Most of you have proba
bly heard of them since they 
first appeared approximately a 
year ago.
The pizza was delivered 
within 18 minutes of our phone 
call; at that rate they could well 
deliver two pizzas while other 
companies were struggling to 
produce the first. This quick 
delivery time was undoubtedly
the cause of its scalding tempera
ture, yeeeha!
The pepperoni pizza, taken a 
factor at a time, was not overly 
exceptional; however, given the 
delivery time and overall stan
dard of quality we felt it well 
deserved the overall ratings it 
got. The only weak point was the 
crust: it was a bit soft and lacked 
flavor. The sauce, cheese, and 
pepperoni were all supurb.
Munch! Slobber! Swallow!
That ham and pineapple pizza 
was gorgeous as it emerged steam
ing from its glorious cardboard 
surroundings. We tested its 
depths and emerged confidently
saying that this was an orgas
mic pie. Ham and Pineapple to
gether in a synergistic cornuco
pia of sweet and sour flavor
ings. Well, it wasnt quite that 
good, but damn, it sure was 
waaay above average!
Drool! Slurp! Chew!
Well. Now that we have used 
most (dont worry, we havent 
exhausted our repertoire) of our 
tacky eating sounds, we will get 
on with the god-sent revela
tions.
The pizza was good. It was 
decidedly not ambrosia, but it 
was well worth the effort of di
gestion.
Now, heres where it gets tricky. 
Can you guess whats off the port 
Bow?
Oh, youre just so smart. Thats 
exactly right, Porter Hall. Some
times the students on this cam
pus just absolutely amaze me. 
Imagine my surprise, when I saw 
one doing open heart surgery on 
the Cut. I didnt know you could... 
But I digress.
Finally, in the rear of the boat, 
(the stem, to be more nautically 
precise), sits the College of Fine 
Arts. We refuse to comment on 
Andys reasons for putting CFA 
there. However, Im sure you could 
figure it out if you really want.
Need more proof? OK, chew on 
this. Navy ROTC holds its drills 
out on the Mall between Baker/ 
Porter and Doherty. What better 
place to have naval drills than on 
the deck of a ship? Also, the halls 
of Baker/Porter are slanted. This 
is because, during construction, 
it rained incessantly causing the 
boat to ship water, and thus the 
entire campus lists to port.
The clincher, of course, is the 
ships bow, which sits out in front
of Hamerschlag. Myself and I 
went down to have a look at this 
ancient piece of history.
Just getting there was an ad
venture in itself. We had to go 
through Doherty, into Wean, 
down the elevator, up a hill, fight 
off a rabid dachshund, jump a 
burning bush, avoid a Nazi patrol 
(I hate Pittsburgh Nazis), and 
scale a fifty-foot wall before the 
bow was even in sight. OK, so I 
exaggerated a little, the dog wasnt 
rabid. But I digress.
When we finally got there, we 
couldnt see over the blasted thing, 
so we climbed on top of it.
The bow, much to our disap
pointment, was a huge chunk of 
concrete; similar in aesthetic 
value to Wean Hall, but much 
smaller. It was adorned with 
various brass naval adornments. 
The brass (or was it concrete 
pretending to be brass?) was tar
nished a neat green color and 
sported an eagle with funny de
signs on its belly.
The view from on top was of 
even more aesthetic value than 
the bow itself. I could see clearly
down into the wonderful ravin i; 
known as Panther Hollow to a. I 
those neat railroad tracks'an:I 
factories and smoke stacks, and [ 
could even see the back of thu 
Carnegie Museum.
However, the best view of all 
was that of the towering Pit t 
Phallic Symbol, which can only 
be seen from this very spot, ;ou 
odd numbered days, when th'3 
moon is in Aquarius, and an Afri
can swallow is flying south by 
southeast directly over your heacL
Needless to say, we were awecl; 
but no matter how impressive the 
genius of Andy, no matter how 
aesthetically beautiful the view, 
no matter how much the Univer
sity pays me not to print this, I 
still wish the campus was a sut - 
marine.
Next time, we shall ponder ove r 
the magic inherent in the brass 
nose of Hamerschlag. Is it mytli 
or is it fact? Or do little elves live 
in Baker with the sole job of shin 
ing the nose?

tion problems. The most frus
trating part is that some students 
want to do things and the para
meters are such that it is almost 
impossible to find them something 
to do, said Ferrin.
Although the network is lim
ited, it has had an impact here at 
Carnegie Mellon. In a small way, 
weve had success as far as being 
able to invite students to the 
possibility of doing volunteer ac
tivities, said Ferrin.
RA Laura Stern, added, I think 
it [the network] is very impor
tant. A lot more needs to be done, 
and unfortunately, people are just 
too busy to take time out.
It can be a neat way to do 
something different and feel good 
about what you do, said Ferrin.

Members ofthe CMU community watch as a graph ofthe projected cases of AIDS is broadcast during 
the AIDS teleconference last thursday.Carnegie Mellon joins three hundred 
campuses in an AIDS teleconference
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
I think about it in terms of 
protecting myself, but I dont 
think about it myself.
Im not really too concerned. 
I think about it, but Im not 
concerned about it myself. 
.Those were just three of the 
many comments made by some 
students surveyed in AIDS in 
the College Community, From 
Crisis to Management.
The program was a live tele
conference that was broadcast 
accross the United States by 
satellite to over 300 college 
campuses. There were six pan
elists who talked about various 
issues related to AIDS.
Dr. Richard Keeling talked 
about medical issues, Rhonda 
Rivera talked on legal issues, 
Leonard Goldberg spoke on stu
dent affairs issues, Patricia 
Kearney spoke on housing is
sues, Laura Pinsky talked about 
counseling, and David shared 
his personal experience with 
AIDS.
Carnegie Mellons reception 
site was in the Wherrett Room 
in Skibo from 1 pm to 4 pm. 
Members from the Pittsburgh 
community, including students 
from other colleges, attended.
The program focused more on 
HIV than the AIDS virus. Most 
people think of the disease as
AIDS, but the acquired immune 
deficency syndrome is only one 
stage ofthe entire HIV process. It 
is possible for someone to have 
the virus for as long as ten or 
twenty years before he or she 
develops noticeable symptoms.
A vaccine has not been found 
and will probably not be discov
ered for many years to come. The 
best methods of prevention are 
still abstinence and the use of 
condoms.
The drug AZT has been shown 
to help slow the effects of some
one who has already contracted 
AIDS, but no cure for the disease 
has been found. AZTs effective
ness can be greatly increased if 
the virus is diagnosed early, so 
periodic testing of people who are 
sexually active, both heterosex
ual and homosexual, is strongly 
recommended. For HIV testing to 
be meaningful and accurate, the 
test must be taken after six 
months after the last possible time 
of infection.
Casual sex is one of the largest 
problems on college campuses 
related to AIDS. An even larger 
problem is what is now termed 
SUI: sex under the influence. 
Under the presence of alcohol, it 
is impossible to be responsible. 
Alcohol and recreational drugs 
take away things like ambivelance, uncertainty, and pain. They 
take away confusion, decision 
making, and judgment. They take
away someonelses ability  to 
make a decision or judgment as 
well, said Keeling.
The number of HIV positive 
tests among steroid users is also 
increasing. The risk is so great 
because there are so many un
knowns to take into considera
tion. Even if all the people who 
share needles are heterosexual, 
anyone in the group could have 
contracted the disease from cas
ual sex.
In years to come, the per
centage of AIDS cases will still 
increase among drug users, but 
will decline for gays. Gay men 
will have lower risks because 
they are now making serious 
changes in their sexual behav
ior.
The last speaker in the tele
conference was David, a nor
mal college student who tested 
positive for HIV after his 18th 
birthday. Like many other stu
dents, he heard a lecture on 
AIDS, but like many other stu
dents, he did not pay attention. 
The lecturer talked at them in
stead of with them thus making 
it difficult; for real communica
tion.
One very importantpointthat 
David made was, Theres!no 
such thing as safer sex while 
you are drinking, or getting 
high.... When I put myself into 
these [sexually risky] situ
ations, I was drunk, or stoned.

As a Student Senator, I plan to do the following: 
1) eliminate 7:30am exams, 2) make the admini

and 4) improve relations between the greeks and 
the rest of the University.

Adaptation of Broadway play comes out a winner
By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Staffwriter
Transferring a drama from 
stage to screen is always a risky 
maneuver. Some works, like Chil
dren of a Lesser God; or Little 
Shop of Horrors, do remarkably 
well, winning both critical and 
public acclaim. Others lose their 
charm on film, like the disap
pointing Chorus Line or Brighton 
Beach Memoirs.
For those of you lucky enough 
to have made it to the tiny Lucille 
Lortel Theatre in New Yorks 
Greenwich Village to see Steel 
Magnolias, you already know that 
the film version has a;tough act to 
follow. Rookie playwright Robert
Harling created this off-Broadway hit in only ten days. Now, in 
his screenwriting debut, Harling 
once again displays his natural 
talent as an author.
The original idea for Steel Mag
nolias came from the circum
stances of Harlings sisters death. 
Despite the bleak inspiration, the 
laughs outweigh the tears in this 
story. The play takes place inside 
Truvy Jones beauty shop, where 
four women, plus Truvy and her 
assistant, get their hair done and 
talk about life. There are no men 
in the play at all.
The movie expands on each of 
these womens lives. The men that 
were only mentioned in the play 
appear in the film. Sam Shepard
plays Truvys chronically unem
ployed husband Spud. Other 
characters are created for the 
various relatives of the other five 
women.
The real story still revolves 
around the close-knit group of six 
friends. When the show begins, 
Shelby (Julia Roberts) is about to 
be married. She and her mother 
MLynn (Sally Field) go to Truvys 
shop to have their hair styled, but 
just as Truvy (Dolly Parton) fin
ishes Shelbys hair, Shelby suf
fers an attack  she is diabetic. 
The audience also learns that 
because of her disease, Shelby 
has been told that having chil
dren is too dangerous to risk.
Truvys assistant Annelle
(Daryl Hannah) is new to this 
town. Much of the first part of the 
movie is seen through her per
spective. Her first encounter with 
Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine), the 
middle aged, acid-tongued woman 
who warns the others, Dont try 
to get on my good side  I no 
longer have one, is rocky at best. 
Olympia Dukakis plays Ouisers 
good friend Clairee, the wife of 
the citys late mayor, completing 
the group.
During a Christmas party, 
Shelby informs her friends that 
she has decided to have a baby 
anyway. MLynn becomes enraged 
when she learns that Shelby is 
willing to put her life at stake to

By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan. Asst. Diversions Editor
Jrom the very first thirty sec
onds ofHarlem Nights I could tell 
that this movie wasnt going to 
live up to my expectations. The 
boring opening credits informed 
me that Eddie Murphy was not 
only one of the main stars of 
Harlem Nights, but he was the 
director, executive producer, and 
rttfter as well. Besides Woody 
Allen, Danny Devito, andLeonard 
Nimoy, no one else has tackled all 
of the above successfully. Before I 
start tearing through the movie, 
iil tell you the plot.
When the movie opens, the year 
is: 1913, and Sugar Ray (Richard 
Pryor) is the owner of a small 
gamblingparlor in New York City. 
Along comes a smart-aleck or
phaned street kid, who manages 
to save Pryors life. Pryor is im
pressed, and he feels sorry for the 
kid, so he adopts him as his own
Bi.
The next thing you know, its 
twenty years later. Bynow Pryors 
adopted son has grown up, is 27 
years old, and is played by Quick 
(Eddie Murphy), while Pryors 
small gambling parlor has turned 
into the most popular after-hours 
nightclub in town. Along comes a 
notorious gangster, Michael 
Lemer (Bugsy Calhoune), who 
wants a huge cut of Murphys and 
Pryors action. They, of course, 
dont want to give Lemer a dime, 
and instead plan on giving him 
some action hes never going to 
forget.
Now that I have summarized 
| the plot for you, let me get right 
down to brass tacks.
-The first problem with this 
movie is the sets. Every single 
scene is filled with so much
Eddie Murphy stars as Quick, co-owner of Club Sugar Ray, in EjiJmB zn.oFs
gangster imagery that it even
tually smothers the viewer. By 
the end of the movie the sets 
become clich, and they no longer 
enhance the film.
Next comes the acting. In 
Murphys last movie, Coming to 
America, he showed for the first 
time some real acting ability. In 
Harlem Nights Murphys acting 
ability is more like it was in his 
roles in Beuerly Hills Cop I and II, 
where he was just playing an 
intense version of himself. What 
that sums up to is a lot of violence, 
swearing, and comedy.
Pryor, on the other hand, plays 
his role as the worried father 
extremely well. His emotion and 
concern come out and grab the 
viewer with authenticity. Honor
able mentions should also go to 
ReddFoxx, Lemer, and especially 
to Arsenio Hall, who has the best 
scene in the entire film.
Finally, we come to the way the 
film is structured. Harlem Nights 
tries to come across as a serious 
film which just happens to have 
humor in it. Coming to America 
was handled this way as well and 
did it successfully, but the Har
lem Nights approach just doesnt 
work. The audience was not just 
laughing at thejokes in the movie, 
but at the movie itself. The only 
thing that saves Harlem Nights 
is the fact that actors dont treat 
the movie too seriously, for if they 
did the movie would be a total 
disaster (as opposed to a partial 
disaster).
Arsenio Hall (center) plays a revenge-crazed mobster with his sights set on Quick (Eddie Murphy, not 
pictured) In Paramounts EjiJmB zn.oFs
There is one good point about 
Harlem Nights', the movie is very 
funny. This one plus will proba
bly saveHarlemNights from being 
a box office flop.
Arsenio Halls one scene is so 
funny that its almost worth the 
admission price just to seeit. Oth
erwise, I dont see any other rea
son to see this movie, unless you 
just love seeing Murphy act. I 
recommend that you save your 
money and wait until tomorrow 
when Back to the Future Part II 
comes out, rather than wasting it 
on Harlem Nights.

Bullwinkle savs...
'Hey Rocky! Theres a tribute to us at the Fulton!
By MICHELLE JONES
Tartan Staffwriter
Remember The Bullwinkle 
Show? Moose and squirrel. Cold 
war spies. Canine time traveler 
and his pet boy. Mischievous 
adventures at first cliff-hung then 
resolved with witty puns. All of 
this nonsense will be in full force 
over the weekend of November 25 
and 26, at the Fulton Mini-The
atre, downtown. ASalute to Rocky 
and Bullwinkle, a big-screen fi: asco, will be shown at 2 and 4 pm 
both days.
; All of this nonsense began thirty 
years ago with fifteen minutes on 
ABC television. Warhol said some
thing about fifteen minutes. 
Moose, squirrel and crowd werent 
listening. Over the years children, 
adults, and everyone else became
fascinated and entertained by the 
antics and wit of the characters.
Moose and squirrel premiered 
on September 29,1959 as Rocky 
and His Friends. The show later 
changed networks (to NBC) and 
became The Bullwinkle Show.
As fate would have it, the car
toon, which has achieved cult 
status, was literally started by 
accident. Creator Jay Ward was 
hit by a truck shortly before the 
opening of his real estate busi
ness. While recuperating he put 
his Harvard Business Degree to 
the test and came up with Rock
ett (Rocky) T. Squirrel and 
Bullwinkle J. Moose.
The rest of the cast was added 
when moose and squirrel acquired 
fifteen additional minutes with 
NBC. From Russia (with love) 
came Boris Badenov and his ac
complice/companion Natasha 
Fatale. Out of a twisted clich of a 
boy and his dog came Mr. Pea
body and his boy, Sherman. And 
to fill remaining minutes came 
Fractured Fairy Tales. June Foray 
provided the voice of squirrel, Na
tasha and Sherman.
Back when The Bullwinkle 
Show was still in production, it 
made a habit of getting the crea
tors into scrapes with sponsors 
and the network. One particu
larly nasty situation occurred 
when Bullwinkle, in puppet form, 
advised viewers to alter their TV 
sets. He told them to remove the 
knobs so that the channel could 
not be changed. In that way well 
be sure to be with you next week. 
Apparently about 20,000 kids 
followed mooses advise. Moose 
was not too popular with parents

just then.
Otherwise, the show appealed 
to both children and adults al
most equally. Ward always said 
that he never intended the show
just for children anyway. 
Instead, he set out to 
prove that cartoons could 
attract adult viewers as 
well. The main goal was 
to make the material 
fanny, clever, and satiri
cal, says Foray.
Along with Foray, the 
identities of the other 
familiar voices are: 
Bullwinkle and Mr. Pea
body (Bill Scott, co-creator), Boris (Paul Frees), 
Aesop (Charlie Ruggles), 
narrator of Rocky and 
Bullwinkle episodes 
(William Conrad, of Jake 
and the Fat Man), and the narra
tor of Fractured Fairy Tales 
(Edward Everett Horton).
Many of us will be away when 
the salute is shown. But weep
not, the future holds many prom. 
ises. In 1990 Walt Disney Home 
Video will repackage and release 
episodes of The Bullwinkle Show 
There is also a feature film, Boris 
and Natasha, in the works. Thi 
film will star David Thomas and 
Sally Kellerman in the title rolej 
Foray, who will do a cameo, re. 
ports that Natasha will sport

The Sugar Cubes fail to fulfill promise of first album
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Staffwriter
With their 1988 debut album 
'Lifes Too Good, the Sugar Cubes 
scratched the music world behind 
 the ears with an innovative blend 
, of spunky New Wave energy and 
an eerie, siren-like atonality.
: Originating in Iceland, the band 
presented an innovative style that 
managed to unify the bizarre and 
the agreeable in an amusing 
manner, without lapsing to eiVs - ther extreme.
Sadly, the Cubes newest work, 
Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week! 
lacks both the coherence and 
melodic backbone of its predeces
sor. The material retains the first 
albums zesty, hopping, off-bal
ance style, but leaves behind any 
sense of musical substance. The 
result is that youre stranded in 
1 an alien world of random dis
jointed waves of sound, punctu
ated by erratic percussion and 
bass. Youre led in circles by 
aimlessly seductive female vocals
familiarity, no air 
pocket of musical ac
cord to sustain you 
through song after song 
of this perplexing 
chaos. Pretty soon, you 
lose the ability to dis
tinguish whats going 
on, and everything 
blurs into a greyish, 
whirling mess. Its as if 
youre losing conscious
ness, and as the Cubes 
try to arouse you with 
yells and whoops you 
only slip deeper into in
difference. After about 
twenty minutes of this, 
while some distinct but arbitrary youre pretty much ready to fling 
growls and hums float in and out the album through the nearest 
of earshot. Every so often youre window and go on with more pleasassaulted by a grating European ant aspects of your life.

Theres often a juxtaposition of 
two parties in the songs (usually 
represented by the contrasting 
male and female vocals) that 
supplies you with contrasting 
angles on the current insanity. 
Tidal Wave (which is acousti
cally reminiscent of anintoxicated 
marimbaband slidinginto apond) 
is a curious mesh of maritime 
imagery, with one character bur
bling about his lust for engine 
exhaust fames. SpeedistheKey,
a brief spat of diseased neo-funk, 
provides us with an insight about 
the lure of abstract velocity. Nail 
is a reverberant, stumbling ditty 
that could easily serve as the basis 
for several illustrious psychiatric 
careers. Eat The Menu, which 
possesses at least a peripheral 
rhythm, tries to elicit our sympa
thy to the plight of the modem 
restaurant-goer, albeit a some
what deranged andpsychotic one. 
Planet takes on a delicate, awe
struck tone of speculation, but 
one wonders if the singers uni
verse is the same one in which 
were currently living. Shoot 
Him is rather self-explanatoiy.
The rest of the album is, well, 
pretty much the same. The few 
distinguishable musical ideas 
presented are vague and ambigu
ous. Some of the more ethereal
bits are absolutely fascinating 
but not to the extent that the' 
prevent you from wishing that 
the band would violently keel over 
and stop the awful racket.
This is not an album for every, 
one. In fact, Im not sure iti 
album for anyone, at least anyone 
who isnt under the throes of 
powerful opiate. Its really a 
shame, since the lyrics are rather 
interesting, and if someone were 
to wrestle them from their nox
ious musical context theyd be 
doing the Sugar Cubes (and us as 
well) a tremendous service.
In any case, Here Today, To
morrow Next Week! doesnt really 
justify the space it takes up in 
your CD rack. It remains, how
ever, convincing testimony to the 
fact that style alone is an inade
quate substitute for content.

The Lizard Lady gets a job
Joe Bob Goes
One of my favorite great aunts,
Vera Glasscock, on the Bardwell 
side of the East Texas Briggses, 
just got a j ob working in the Mens 
Billfold Department of J.C.
Penneys in Fort Worth, and Ive 
been put in charge of watching 
her so she doesnt commit any 
indecent public acts or otherwise 
embarrass the family.
Vera is the only 89-year-old 
woman with a full-frontal photo
graph in the Texas Connection 
swingers magazine.
We told Vera its not gonna 
work, theres no such thing as 89- 
v year-old swingers, and even if 
there is such a thing, they still 
dont wanna see any nude pic
tures of her, but Vera believes 
 that after 55 years of daily goats 
milk skin treatments, she has the 
,.face, body, and personality of a 
. 29-year-old. Thats what shell tell 
you. I have the face, body, and 
personality of a 29-year-old, shell 
tell you. Billy Tompkins said so.
And I told her, Vera, Billy 
Tompkins also died in 1955.
Also, Im the guy that has to 
"deal with the Texas Connection 
"editorial staff when they call me 
up. Please, Joe Bob, make her 
take the ad out, they say. Well 
pay her money. Were getting 
 letters from people that think its 
a picture of a suffering animal 
being used for medical research.
We dont want the animal rights 
people on our backs.
And so I tried to talk to Vera 
' once or twice, but she said, They 
advertise free photos for unat
tached female swingers, and by 
' God Im unattached, and by God 
Im female, and by God Im a hereandhaulsyouofftotheTexas Hey, everybodys forgotten by
swinger.
Well, could you at least tone 
down the copy a little bit? Take 
out the stuff about the garden 
hoes? It makes people think youre 
a tropical plant.
You cant reason with the 
woman. Shes the most sexually 
active 89-year-old on the planet. 
And so now what happens, but 
she goes and she gets a job. And 
she not only gets a job, she gets 
one where shes been trying to get 
a job her whole life  J.C. 
Penneys Mens Billfold Depart
ment  and she did it for one 
reason. Shes gonna snag one of 
those guys before he knows what 
hit him. And she gets to see whats 
in his billfold first.
So I drove out to Fort Worth to 
try to talk to her. But when I got 
there it was already too late. She 
had some of the finer cowhide 
models out of their plasticenecovered billfold gift boxes, and 
what do you think she was doing 
with em? She was removing the 
photo ofVic Damone, and she was 
replacing it with her picture.
And it was the one from the 
Texas Connection Magazine!
Vera, Ive got two choices. I can 
wait here till you pass one ofthose 
billfolds to a customer and J.C. 
Penneys fires your hiney and the 
Fort Worth Vice Squad comes in
State Institute for 
the Feeble-Minded. 
Or you can reas
semble those plasticene covers right 
this minute Bridget 
those billfolds back 
into their original 
condition. The choice is yours."
But right at that moment, I had 
to stop talking, cause a welldressed, greyhaired gentleman 
ambled up to the sales counter 
and said, Excuse me, but Im 
looking for something in lizard. 
Natural lizard or imitation 
lizard? Vera said.
Im looking for a lizard that... 
er... He hesitated.
Go ahead, she told him, I 
think I can help you.
I would like to speak to the 
lady who... uh... it has to do with 
a photograph...
You looking for the Lizard 
Lady, honey?
You meanitsyou! t want seven 
more pictures, and I want you to 
have dinner with me. Sorry, I 
didnt recognize you with your 
clothes on.
Its all right, hon, happens all 
the time.
I can tell that Veras gonna soil 
the Briggs family reputation all 
over North Texas again.
And speaking of actors who 
refuse to go away, Patrick Macnee is back again in Masque of the 
Red Deathnot the real Masque 
of the Red Death with Vincent 
Price, made by Drive-In King 
Roger Corman in 1964, but a new 
Masque oftheRedDeath made by 
Roger Corman. Roger decided,
now, 25 years, thats long enough, 
right? Always remember, they 
dont call him King of Exploita
tion for nothing. The original 
Edgar Allan Poe movies starring 
Vincent Price are great, but when 
they made this one, they did 
something a little different. They 
not only wanted to portray the red 
death, they wanted to use dead 
actors, for enhanced reality. Its a 
pretty amazing feat, all of them 
talking like theyre dead, moving 
like theyre dead, even dancing 
like theyre dead, and the direc
tor, Larry Brand, made everything 
real dark so that you cant quite 
see anything, so after a while you 
go Nothing happening in this 
sceneoh! I get it! Theyre dead!
Adrian Paul is Prince Prospero, 
wandering around his castle like 
a doorstop on quaaludes, saying 
stuff like Now it is death that 
serves man! Clare Hoak is the 
village virgin brought in by 
Prosperos army to entertain the 
homy troops. Tracy Reiner (Robs 
daughter) is Prosperos sister and 
wife he has to keep in line with a 
hot poker. And Patrick Macnee is 
the Red Death, galloping through 
the countryside in a scarlet cape. 
Put them all together and youve 
got ... a real snoozer. Not even 
much torture or pillaging. Sure, 
theres a little hot boiling oil on 
the peasants, some skull crush
ing on the rack, some stomach 
carving. But it just doesnt have 
the old Vincent Price evil in it.
Seven breasts. Forty dead bod
ies. Three pathetic zombies. 
Dungeon aardvarking. Skull 
cracking. Throat slashing. Bloody 
hand spiking. Peasant boiling.
Boy, Is that guy going to have a headache in the morning. One of the 
many fun scenes from the snoozer rjFPm vf om ymW pmjos
Hot-poker head branding. Pitiful no longer acts in creation he

Tartan Staffwriter
Ms. Socially Conscious and her 
! acoustic guitar are back yet again 
.in Crossroads.
- All of the elements that made 
-Tracy Chapman so popular are 
-present in this album. There are 
rstories and allegories of social 
^problems, but on another level 
Ithere is a set of songs about indi
viduality. It is a fascinating mix 
of the conflicts between people, 
conflicts of the soul, and conflicts 
between people and the soul.
; Society and the soul, being true 
to yourself; these are constant 
ihemes through all of Chapmans 
:songs. The album begins with the 
-title track, Crossroads. The lyr3cs are powerful; All you folks 
-ihink I got my price/At which Ill 
-sell all that is mine/You think 
money rules when all else fails/ 
Go sell your soul and keep your
courtesy Elektra Records 
shell/Tm trying to protect what I 
keep inside/All the reasons why I 
live my life. There is a power and 
confidence in her voice, yet it is 
gentle and soothing. The song 
builds to a crescendo as she pro
claims, Save my soul... save my
self, and then it ends abruptly.
Chapman tries to deliver the
same theme in another 
song, Sub City, but 
fails. All she ends up 
saying is capitalist pigs 
are pigs, and the home
less are suffering. Here 
in subcity life is hard/ 
We cant receive any ... 
government relief/Id 
like to give Mr. Presi
dent my honest regards/ 
For dis..regarding me..
Its ho-hum, although 
it is kind of funny. 
Though the cliche d 
themes about what an 
ugly place the world has 
become are redundant, her noble 
intentions and the richness of the 
percussion and harmonica atone 
for being tiresome.
Material Worldis similarly 
dull but redeems itself by paint
ing interesting images such as 
Our own ancestors are hungry 
ghosts/Closets so full of bones they
wont close.
The social awareness quota 
filled by these songs, the album 
moves on to the ballads. Bridges 
starts off delicately. The acoustic 
guitar swells slowly and calls forth 
the piano and the cymbals into a 
unified theme. The song moves in 
waves, the cymbals pushing for
ward and the piano coming in to 
fill the vacuum. Amidst all the 
motion there is the consistency of 
the guitar and her soothing voice.
The lyrics are bittersweet. All 
the bridges that you bum, come 
back one day to haunt you/But all 
my ghosts they find me/Like my 
past they think they own me/in 
dreams and dark comers they 
surround me/Till I cry, I cry. 
Perhaps one of the greatest 
assets of this album is its diver
sity. One of the more uplifting 
sing along songs is Freedom 
Now, dedicated to Nelson Man
dela. While listening to it, you
imagine a chorus of people sing
ing and clapping  not campfire 
songs  songs with unbridled 
hope and optimism.
Chapman sings Soon must 
come the day/When the righteous 
have their way/Unjustly tried are 
free/And people live in peace I 
say/Give the man release/Go on 
and set your conscience free... 
the chorus sings Ooooooh, 
ooooooh, and then, as if playing 
for a child on a spring day, there 
is the banjo to give the song its 
spine.
Bom to Fight is perhaps the 
biggest departure from what 
Tracy Chapman is known for. Its 
folksy, but carries a Bad, Bad 
Leroy Brown atmosphere. The 
harmonica and the trumpet lend 
to its feeling of good old-fashioned 
fun. Its truly refreshing to see 
this young artist, who always 
seems to bear the weight of the 
world on her shoulders, kick back
and enjoy herself.
There are some other very good 
songs such as the powerful ballad 
Careful of My Heart, and the 
bitter This Time. All That You 
Have is Your Soul is, the. final 
and perhaps the best song on.the 
album. Chapman speaks of how 
her mothers dreams died, how 
she paid for love with her life. It is 
like a lullaby, laced with a deep 
sadness that reverberates in 
Chapmans warm voice. Donthe 
tempted by the shiny apple/Dojit 
you eat of bitter fruit/Hunger oflly 
for a taste of justice/Hunger onily 
for a world truth... Cause all that 
you have is your soul.
When artists get on to their Mil
lionth album, fans often become 
nostalgic for the old stuff. This 
is old stuff in the making. 
Crossroads is truly a pleasant 
surprise, and should satisfy;! a 
diverse body of listeners for years 
to come.

Women On The Verge Of A 
Nervous Breakdown
Spanish writer/director Pedro Almodovar has 
produced a marvelous satire on love relationships 
in his most successful film Women On The Verge Of 
A Nervous Breakdown. The movie follows the fran
tic lives of several women and the men they adore 
and despise. While the women in this film often fall 
victim to the false charms of these men, they also 
show great strength in dealing with their heart
breaks. Worth the dollar on a Thursday night.

Scrooged
Get into the Christmas spirit early with Bill 
Murrays modern version of A Christmas Carol. 
Written by veteran Saturday Night Live writers 
Mitch Glazer and Michael ODonoghue, Scrooged 
follows a similar format to the Dickens classic but 
with Murray as Frank Cross, an evil television 
executive. The strong supporting cast includes Carol 
Kane, John Forsythe, and Karen Allen. The ending 
is a bit disappointing, but there are enough laughs 
to warrant the dollar price.

Pet Sematary
Like too many of Stephen Kings novels, Pet Se
matary is a clever, chilling book and a miserable 
movie. Dale Midkiff stars as a family man who 
discovers a cemetary where animals are buried and 
then come back to life. The only trouble is that these 
furry friends become vicious monsters the second 
time around. So, you can probably guess what 
happens when, grief-stricken by his three-year-old 
sons death, Midkiff decides to bury the boy along 
with all the pets. The film fails to become the spinetingling thriller that King so often delivers on 
paper.

Diamonds Are Forever
Even back in 1971 when Diamonds Are Forever 
was released, critics and audiences alike were look
ing for an end to the James Bond series. Now with 
eighteen years worth of James Bond films following 
that release, Diamonds Are Forever hardly stands 
out as a classic. As Bond, Sean Connery tries to 
trace a gang of diamond smugglers and ultimately 
foil their plan to take over the world. Die-hard fans 
may enjoy Diamonds, but there are far better Bond 
films out there. Price aside, this movie just isnt 
worth your time.

The Upstage gets a plethora of good bands
By DAN BEDWA
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
All right, its Thanksgiving. 
Nothing is going on, so just fold 
up the paper, stick it in your bags, 
and ignore it until Saturday.
Now its Saturday. Time to get 
back to Pittsburgh, because Urge 
Overkill, the Vivians, and Punch
ing Contest are coming to the 
Upstage Sunday (November 26). 
Yeah, another good show. Whattya gonna do?
Urge Overkill have been called 
court jesters, and thats a fair 
assessment of a band that per
forms in gold suitcoats. Theyve 
covered Wichita Lineman (and 
made it work), theyve released 
two LPs, the latest called Jesus 
Urge Superstar, and theyve 
managed to be and stay funny 
without becoming stupid. Thats 
not funny in the oh, isnt that
clever ha-ha sense  theyre far 
too busy playing Big Noisy Rock 
to worry about being clever, much 
to their credit, but rather funny 
in the were taking this seriously 
so you dont have to sense. But 
dont take my word for it. Go see 
for yourself.
The Vivians are the best band 
in Ohio. They could be the best 
band in far more states, but they
you to go see them 
again. They re
leased an EP, Vivicide, this summer, 
but their live show 
completely smokes 
the record. (The EP 
is very good, but 
live Vivs are in a 
class all by them
selves. Think Laughing Hyenas 
for a similar intensity level.) Urge 
Overkill is good, but the Vivians 
are not to be missed, especially 
when theyre goingto be just down 
the street.
I think this show is the first 
official sort of notice that Whistle 
isnt Whistle any more. Theyve 
changed their name to Punching 
Contest to avoid any potential
only live in Ohio, so theyre sort of legal hassles with the rap group 
limited. If you havent seen them, Whistle. The change is really no 
youshould.Ifyouhaveseenthem, big surprise, though, since nothen I shouldnt have to convince body in the band was ever really
fond of the name Whistle. 
band had been changing name, 
fairly regularly until their firf 
show at the Sonic Temple, ant 
Whistle just happened to be ths 
name they had at the time, si 
they stuck with it. Thats all that 
changed, so you should want to 
see them too.
I guess I should say that thi 
addition of Punching Contest ti 
the bill makes this a must-se( 
show, but I guess I already sait 
that, so I wont. But, really, wh; 
are you going to do at home anv 
way?
The Upstage is at 3609 Forba 
Avenue. The show is scheduled!! 
start at 8 pm, and, since its  
Sunday, will probably start rea 
sonably close to that time so don 
be too late.

Red Army comes to the Benedum Center
By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Following on the heels of the 
Chautauqua at Pitt series is the 
first U.S. tour of the Alexandrov 
Red Army Song and Dance En
semble, which will be performing 
at the Benedum Center on De
cember 5 and 6 at 8 pm.
The members of this Soviet 
military ensemble are considered 
their countrys finest musicians 
and dancers, bringing some of the 
best of Soviet culture to the rest 
of the world.
This Soviet spectacle opened in 
New York on September 12 to 
critical acclaim and standing 
ovations. United Press Interna
tional touted it as an absolutely 
first rate company, while the New; 
York Daily News praised the 
dancers tremendous athleticism 
and precision and New York 
Newsday commented that, the 
singing was strong, rich, and very 
well disciplined.
The company has played in 
every country in the world except
 until this tour  the United 
States. This tremendous troupe 
will fill the spacious Benedum 
Center with a 100-voice all-male 
chorus and 50 exuberant dancers 
in native costume, accompanied 
by musicians playing authentic 
Russian instruments. They prom
ise to display the richness and ex
citement of Russian culture, and 
will undoubtedly entertain even 
the most serious of audiences.
The company consists of almost 
200 performers, many of whom 
are soldiers in the Red Army, and 
was founded 60 years ago by 
Alexander Alexandrov, the com
poser of the Soviet national an
them. The singers, dancers, and 
musicians that make up the Red 
Army Ensemble are considered 
not only some of the finest talent 
of their country, but national 
heroes. Throughout its history, 
some of the incarnations of the 
group have performed on the front 
lines between barrages and ma
chine gun fire.
For this first American tour a 
special program has been put

the best and most famous selected 
of Russian music and dance, as 
well as a selection of music by 
George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, 
and American Folk and popular 
song classics.
Cultural exchanges such as this 
can only help to strengthen the 
ties with the Soviet Union, which
would continue the positive move

the last few years. Besides, you 
can never get enough music.

New jazz albums are a pleasure
By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
After a one week break, Im 
back with the latest in jazz. This 
week Im going to give you some 
vinyl to chase after now that you 
know where to find it. Before I 
begin, I want to make sure you all 
know about the second CMU jazz 
ensemble concert of this season, 
which will be held tonight at 7:30 
pm in the Alumni Concert Hall in 
the College of Fine Arts. Be there!
Lets take a look at Jimmy 
Gourleys The Left Bank of New 
York. Gourley is an Americanjazz 
guitarist who has lived in Paris 
for the past three and a half dec
ades. He has established hims&lf 
there as the best of the bebop 
pickers, having brought the style 
of Charlie Parker with him when 
he emigrated in the early fifties.
Probably best known for his 
Paris sessionrecordings withjazz 
legend Clifford Brown, Gourley 
has also worked with such no
tables as Zoot Sims, Lee Konitz, 
and Gigi Gryce.
It is a Gryce number entitled 
Salute to the Bandbox which is 
the highlight of this album. 
Gourley originally recorded this 
tune in a sextet with Clifford 
Brown in 1953, but it hasnt lost 
its punch some 35 years later.
Throughout the album Gourley 
shows himself to be at his prime, 
a melodic and daring bebopper 
who always displays the utmost 
taste. His lines are as fluid as any 
of his mentor Raneys, though 
sometimes Gourley shows a bit 
more fire in his playing than his 
contemporary.
The majority of the songs on the 
album are standards, with 
Bamoun Beauty being the only 
Gourley original. Half of the 
numbers are performed in a gui
tar, bass, drum trio setting, with 
acoustic bassist Marc Johnson 
offering some of his best playing 
to date. Up-and-coming tenor 
saxophonist RalphMoore contrib
utes his talents on four tracks,
along with trumpeter Don Siekler.
Overall this is a great album, 
and is one of the best bebop guitar 
releases in a while. Jimmy Raney 
fans will immediately appreciate 
Gourleys Raney-influenced tal
ent, and they will also enjoy what 
Gourley has added to the vocabu
lary of the guitar.
Moving now from bebop to fu
sion/mainstream/Latin, weve got 
Pat Methenys latest vinyl effort, 
Letter From Home. Metheny has 
consistently produced great al
bums since his 1975 solo release 
Bright Life Size with bassist Jaco 
Pastorius. This album is no ex
ception.
Here Metheny further explores 
the possibilities of combining 
Latin styles and Brazilian folk 
influences with his exciting brand 
of jazz, creating the most amaz
ing compositions. He continues to 
develop great melodies, such as 
on Beat 70 and Dream of the 
Return.
Throughout, Metheny demon
strates his broad range of guitar 
talents, making the guitar synth 
sing on Are We There Yet?, play
ing some lush chordal passages 
on the laid-back Spring Aint 
Here, and showing his dexterity 
and speed of thought on the groov
ing Have You Heard. Metheny 
is once again backed up by highclass talent such as keyboardist 
Lyle Mays and bassist Steve 
Rodby.
The Latin influences show 
through most vividly on tunes 
such as Better Days Ahead, a 
samba, and a short piece similar 
to Brazilian folk music entitled 
45/8. Overall, this is the best 
album he has produced yet; not
an easy asser
tion to make. 
But the playing, 
diversity, and 
creativity dem
onstrated on 
this recording 
are all elements 
that help make
Metheny one of the best.
Now lets get into the realm of 
heavy duty fusion, where jazz 
meets funk meets rock meets ... 
Japanesemusic? Yes, thats right, 
Japanese music.- The recording 
Im talking about is Kilowatt, the 
latest outing by Japanese virtu
oso Kazumi Watanabe, and his 
seventh on the Gramavision la
bel.
Watanabe, who is Japans gen
ius of the guitar, has been voted 
Guitarist of the Year for the 
past nine years running in that 
countrys Journal. Having
influences as diverse as Jimi 
Hendrix, the Ventures, Wes 
Montgomery, and Jimmy Smith, 
Watanabe has successfully 
blended elements of a number of 
diverse musical styles to create 
what is undoubtedly his own 
sound.
On this outing he expands
himself even further than on las 
years Spice of Life Too. He rum 
the gamut between heavy funk 
jazz/pop, and straight-ahead 
acoustic jazz, proving that he cai 
indeed do it all well. He 
demonstrates a command over a 
wide range of guitar styles, show 
ing that he can play comfortabl 
with either electric, synth, o 
acoustic guitar.
A highlight of this album is th 
acousticguitar/bass duet perform 
ance of Herbie Hancocks Dol 
phin Dance with bassist Bunn 
Brunei. Both Watanabe an 
Brunei swing hard on this tune 
Wayne Shorter adds some bril 
liant saxophone to two songs 
Bernard, on which his sopran 
sings, and Capri, on which hi 
tenor works beautifully with th 
underlying Japanese themes,
The music is tight and th 
compositions are some 
Kazumis best, as he moves awa 
from some of the groove-orientei 
writing evident on his 198 
release Spice of Life. In a sense 
this is the best of Watanabe, be 
cause he just keeps getting bet 
ter.
Jeff Muller is a junior writim 
major.
Magnolias is superb
continued from page Lll
have a child. MLynn also 
blames Shelbys husband Ja
son, whom she believes is terri
bly selfish to want a child more 
than Shelbys good health.
The six stars all deliver stun
ning performances. MacLaine 
is downright scary, and yet she 
allows the audience to see her 
characters deeply hidden emo
tions. Hannah convinces the au
dience that she truly is shy and 
reserved. Field has the most 
difficult role, as the woman who 
must keep herself collected 
while everyone around her is 
acting only on emotion.
While most of the plot remains
the same from the play to the 
movie, the two are really two 
separate experiences alto
gether. Those who have seen 
the play maybe disappointed to 
find that a few great lines are 
delivered differently in the 
movie and end up losing their 
comic effect. However, the film 
more than recovers from this 
with new lines and some hilari
ous visual moments that are 
not possible on stage. The movie 
doesnt cost as much, and it is 
more accessible than the play, 
but both are worth your time.
The motion picture version of 
Steel Magnolias is currently 
playing in Pittsburgh.
