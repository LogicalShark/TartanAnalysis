An Almosl-Hiot
Patty Haislip Crowned Snow Queen I 
At Successful Prom on Friday Night
By Salmon \P. Salmon
Rain and smog did not quash 
the spirits of Tech students who 
attended the Junior Prom Fri
day night. There was an almostriot -rir^the hat^checking room 
after the dance, simply because no 
one attempted to leave early. And 
why?
It may have been A1 Donahue^ 
danceable orchestra, his versatile 
players, their attempts to please; 
or Als pleasant, cooperative man
ner; or the singing of Paula Kelly; 
or the amusing novelty numbers.
It may have been the wellplanned build-up to the crowningi 
of Martha Patty Haislip as 
Techs first Snow Queen; with 
the shower of balloons, cotton 
balls and artificial snow; or the
Grand March, that boasted few 
bystanders.
Then again, it may have been 
the large yet intimate crowd; or 
the informally formal atmosphere; 
or the side shows put y>n by 
jit-faWMjjse .Red Burch,, and Bob 
Deans, Prom .Chairman, who en
joyed himself moru . than anyone 
present (when he was.t worry
ing about whether the crdv'd had 
passed the 300-couple mark.)
It may have been the crazily 
moving color of gowns, spaced off 
by the pleasant monotony of mov
ing, black figures. It may have 
been . . . but enough . . . what
ever was responsible caused an 
almost-riot at the hat-checking 
room after the dance.
Graduate Metallurgists Make 
Metal Electroplating Practical
French Scientists 
First Investigated 
Burnishing Process
Appearing in the February is
sue of the technical journal 
 Metals Progress is an article 
written jointly by George E. Pellisier, Harold Markus, and Pro
fessor Robert F. Mehl, Director, 
Metals Research Laboratory, de
scribing work done in the Metals 
Research Laboratory on a pro
cess of electropolishing.
For the benefit of the unin
itiated, polishing is the prepara
tion of specimens of metals pre
liminary to examination undei 
the miscroscope. At present, the 
final stages of polishing are done 
on rotating wheels, with cloths 
and abrasives. This is a tedious 
and difficult job since it is not 
easy to get a level, scratch-free 
surface;' and polishing is the bane 
of the metallurgist.
Originated by French 
First investigated by two 
French scientists, Jacquet and 
Anrocquet, the subject of electro
polishing was chosen as an inves
tigative study by two graduate 
metallurgists, Pellisier and Mark
us. With the help of Dr. Mehl, 
the process, as theoretically de
termined by the Frenchmen, was 
made practical.
Electropolishing is merely elec
troplating in reverse. The metal 
to be polished is first abraded 
with emery paper to remove large 
imperfections. It is then im
mersed in a bath of acetic anhy
dride and perchloric acid mixture. 
A cell, the anode of which is the 
sample, is formed by passing a 
current through the solution. Fine 
particles leave the metal thus giv(Continued on Page 2)

Scotch n Soda 
To Give Three 
Performances
Success In School 
Poll Adds Spirit;
Hit Is Promised
Given the go-ahead signal by 
the student body in the election 
last Wednesday, the Scotch and 
Soda Club is starting work imme
diately on their coming show. The 
revue is scheduled for May 8, 9, 
and 10 this year. In pervious 
years there have been only two 
performances, but due to the suc
cess of past shows, this one will 
be given one night for the school 
and two for the general public.
So that chorus rehearsals may 
get under way as soon as possible, 
song tryouts are being held today 
at 4:30 in the Exhibition Room. 
Any original song, as long as it is 
arranged for piano, will be audi
tioned.
Tomorrow, also at 4:30, in 106 
Arts, the publicity staff will meet, 
since two performances of the 
revue will be given for the gen
eral public, it is not too early to 
make definite plans for advertis
ing the show.
Alex Segal 40 . has been chosen 
as the director of this years 
Scotch and Soda revue. A com

EE Fraternity TU
Wins Award
Service to School, 
Industry Brings 
Plague to EKN
Carnegies Chapter of Eta Kap
pa Nu, National Electrical En
gineering Fraternity, has been 
awarded a silver plaque designat
ing it as the most outstanding 
for 1938-39.
Each year the National Council 
of the fraternity presents this 
plaque-to the chapter which in'its 
opinion has accomplished the 
most during the previous acad
emic year. To qualify for the 
award, the chapter must have a 
minimum of meetings with a 
minimum attendance, besides 
participating in campus activities'.
Techs chapter took a major 
part in the Annual Exhibition 
Night, organized an employment 
service in the face of opposition 
from the school bureau, and has 
succeeded in establishing a shelf 
in the engineering library. They 
Sponsored several lectures by out
standing men in industry and 
demonstrated a corona for the 
benefit of those who had never 
seen this phenomenon of elec
tricity before. Members of the 
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment were among those in the 
audience. With the help of the 
faculty a questionnaire was drawn 
up, and as a result, several 
changes were made by the school 
administration in regard to de
partment and general subjects.
Several years ago Sigma Chap
iter at Carnegie was runner-up 
for w&t&^rd in a race so close 
that the proverbial hair was al
most split to picl< m^vviinner.
This year the chapter wass-cpmpensated -for its many years of 
outstanding service to school, in 
dustry, and fraternity by being 
presented with this much soughtafter award.
Science Group 
Meets Feb.. 15
On Thursday, February 15, at 
11:30 the twelfth meeting of the 
Sigma Xi General Science Col
loquium will be held in the Fac
ulty Lounge adjoining the Com
mons. The meeting will have as 
its speaker Professor ' H. A. 
Thomas of the Department of 
Civil Engineering. He will talk 
on Cavitation in Hydraulic 
Structures.
This subject will be of special 
interest to the Mechanical and 
Civil Engineering students who 
are specializing in hydraulics. 
Cavitation is a name applied to 
the destructive effect which eddy 
currents in water have on me
chanical structures. The speaker 
will set forth the theories pertain
ing to this study, about which 
relatively little is known.
Mr. Thomas is recognized as a 
national authority on hydraulics, 
and. is a Consultant to the gov
ernment engineers on Flood Con
trol. Many of his river bed 
models in Engineering Hall are 
used in Flood Control research.

Design, Write Play
The Department of Drama's 
next show, No More Marriages 
will be one of the most complete 
productions in Tech history. The 
play, itself, is the product of the 
pen of Edward Hunt 41 and was 
a product of his playwriting class.
The getting was designed by 
Cort Steen, a senior in the De
partment. The set is in the mod
ern style, depicting a new Buck's 
County home in Pennsylvania. 
The general color scheme is in 
yellows and greens.
The show is being built by the 
freshman girls, who are replac
ing the boys on the construction 
crew for this show. The stage 
carpenter, in charge of construc
tion is Grey Lockwood, '40. The 
properties are being built under 
the guidance of John_ Blanken
ship.
WAA Bowlers 
Rout Pinboys 
From Alleys
Pity the poor pin boys at the 
bowling alleys since the W. A. A. 
has'decided to sponsor bowling 
there. Now,, they spe'nd the af
ternoon dodging anvoccasional ball 
that is hurled, for some rrtyslerious reason, in their direction." 
Later, they will be just as unhap
py picking up pins between 
strikes of a seemingly endless line 
of girls.
. ^That, at least, is the result in
dicated by the first try-out made 
last week. There were experts, 
beginners, and plain non-bowlers 
by the dozen; each was allowed 
to play four games free of charge. 
They supplied themselves with 
| pistachio nuts and started to work, 
j For two hours they bowled and 
J turned in, it must be admitted, not 
amazing scores, but at least a 
good showing. They could scarce
ly move during the next few days, 
but they are anxious to go back 
next week. Theyinhuman crea
tures that they aremust *ke a 
peculiar pleasure in watching 
those poor pin boys dashing back 
and forthdodging their strikes 
and spares.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Presidents Message to Youth 
Congress Seemed Impatient
My friends, that reason was unadulterated twaddle, un
adulterated twaddle . . Nobody with any pretense of 
common sense believes ... . . . As everybody knows, who 
lias got the courage to face the facts . . .
These remarks were part of the fatherly advice that the 
President of the United States gave on Saturday to 3,500 dele
gates of the American Youth Congress, in Washington. His 
talk was impatient, as though at any moment lie might say, 
Look, kiddies, don't do any thinking, and difficult things 
like that; just rely on your Uncle Dudley.
The delegates, mostly college students who are members 
of liberal organizations that belong to the Youth Congress, came 
to Washington to ask Congress to pass the Youth Act, a meas
ure that asks for expansion of the youth aid program. In his 
talk, the President ignored the purpose that brought the Youth 
Congress to Washington, except to misconstrue it by saying: 
Dont seek or expect a panaceasome wonderful new law 
that will give to everyone who needs it a hand-out or a guar
antee of permanent remunerative occupation of your own 
choosing.
lie virtually attacked the democracy that he later defended 
(in name) by stating that gatherings have no right to pass 
resolutions on subjects which you have not thought through 
and 011 which you cannot possibly have complete knowledge. 
He said that these policies must be formed by those who have 
given deep study to every phase of the problem, and used as 
his example a resolution of a youth group adopted to condemn 
the granting of any aid or loans to Finland, since such action 
may involve the United States in war. It was this resolution 
that the President called twaddle.
We agree wholeheartedly with John L. Lewis who spoke to 
the youth group later in the day, and said about the twaddle 
resolution:
It (the resolution) is a protest, and after all, who has a 
bigger, greater right to protest against war or any part of war, 
or the diplomatic intrigues of war, or the subtle politics preceding 
war, than the young men who, in the event of war, would become 
cannon fodder?
Mr. Lewis continued:
So I hope that you will adopt resolutions when you think it 
is time to adopt resolutions on the question of peace, or war, or 
jobs, or civil liberties, or any question which concerns you as 
citizens and as Americans.
Why, I think the President would understand that if he ap
plied the same rule to the professional politicians in the Demo
cratic party and that if they continue talk about anything that 
they did not understand he would lose the next election. And I 
am not sure that the President himself if he applied the  same 
rule to himself would not find his efficiency impaired.
President Roosevelt also said, That the Soviet Union 
would because of this (loans, aid to Finland) declare war on the 
United States is about the silliest thing that I have ever' lieard 
advanced in the 58 years of my life, that that we are going to 
war ourselves with the Soviet Union is an equally silly thought. 
The resolution in question did not say that we are going 
to war with the Soviet Union, that was the Presidents own 
contribution, but neither can the youth of America see the 
Soviet Union considering the United States as neutral if the 
United States helps Finland. Why did we not jump to the aid 
of Ethiopia, or China, or .Czechoslovakia, or Poland? We be8ieve that the answer lies in the possibility that the President 
and Congress of the United States may be more interested in 
pleasing those few among us who are unified, strong, and have 
voice because of their interests and wealthmore that they 
are interested in pleasing the youth groups who pass resolu
tions, and who have no voice and no strength. These few 
that we mentioned fear socialistic movements, because they 
an attack on the system that favors them. They fear 
munism and the success of Russiawhich is conside^. a m0(je] 
by some who seek changeto such '-extent that Amer
ican involvement in war, butchery of American
youth, it for the pm'pos' Qj CJ;ns]img Communism, would be 
desirable to them.n
5o we sajMrr|he merjcan Youth Congress what President 
sa'd to them in closing his Saturday scolding, 
o course, that almost everything the President said 
preceding his conclusion directly contradicted the remark itself: 
Keep your ideals high, keep both feet on the ground, 
and keep everlastingly at it.

Metal Polishing 
Data Published
(Continued from Page One) 
ing it a high polish. The entire 
process takes from ten to fifteen 
minutes.
Electropolishing is considered to 
be highly superior to the mechan
ical method in many ways. It is 
rapid, cheap, and convenient. The 
electricity required may be sup
plied by a small portable battery. 
The materials used are very in
expensive when compared to the 
various grinding and polishing de
vices needed for mechanical fin
ishing. The common difficulties of 
uneven polishing, flowed metals, 
and pitting are avoided by us
ing the new method.
Process Not Perfected
This process has not been fully 
perfected, however. Much re
search remains to be done before 
electropolishing can become gen
erally adaptable. It may be suc
cessfully applied to cast iron, 
steel, copper, nickel, and stainless 
steel. For some alloys, however, 
difficulty is experienced in pre
serving a uniform finish.
The method has not been pat
ented. Although it is still in ex
perimental form, electropolishing 
has already aroused much inter
est. The inquiries which have 
come in from the metallurgists of 
leading steel companies seem to 
indicate that this process will soon 
be more than an investigative 
study.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1940THE CARNEGIE TARTAN8
W, A. A. NEWS I
 By Betty Parker----
The board meeting last week 
brought forth many interesting 
activities of the W. A. A. An in
vitation from Allegheny College 
lor two men and two women to 
attend the winter carnival Feb
ruary 10 and 11 was considered 
and accepted. Two gals went with 
two boys from the intramural 
board, and well wait reports of 
the good times they had. Hope 
they didnt have quite the bad 
log we had, for winter sporting 
in that kind of weather wouldnt 
exactly be fun. There were other 
invitations that sounded tempt
ing and are something to look for
ward to.
February 16 is coming sooner 
than you all realize, and that 
means you havent much time to 
make that plan to go to the dance 
. .that BARN DANCE. No need 
to get a date unless you want to 
. . . youre welcome anyway you 
want to come.
For all those lovers of badmin
ton, here is some good news. We 
have joined the Pittsburgh Bad
minton Association which means 
that all those interested should 
look for notices about tourna
ments that will be played and all 
other activities connected with 
the Association, about which I 
will have more to say later.
There were some movies of pop
ular sports planned for some day 
soon, but it seems the showing 
of them, conflicts with a hundred 
other activities on campus, but 
never let that daunt Jan Levy, 
and she will find the time and 
the place and youll all hear about 
it. Be sure to go when you do 
hear, though, because they sound 
wonderful, one reel on Modern 
Dance, on Basketball, and on ski
ing.________________________________

NOTES FROM OUR SCRAPBOOK
--By DOC BURKE, Sports Editor --
Harold Hirsch, one of Coach Allan Risedorphs mainstays on 
the swimming team, broke the school record for the 440-yard 
free style in a recent meet with W-J. His time for the event 
was 5:36.5, which isnt bad on anybodys swimming team.
The old record of 5:40 was made last year by "Deacon 
Vance, present co-captain of the team.
Harold was out of school last year, so he has been making 
up for lost time this season. Incidentally, his brother is Na
tional Scholastic Backstroke Champion, and at present is doing 
his swimming for Ohio State.

The Tartan basketball team shoves off this Thursday for
Philadelphia here Temple will be met Friday night in one 
part of a double-header. The next night Captain Rube Stark 
will make a home town appearance in Lancaster as he leads his 
"boys against a strong Franklin and Marshall five.
; ; * . #
Before the Tech-Geneva game last Saturday night the
fencers put on a little show. But, low and behold, the Duke 
fencers who were to be the opponents did not show up. The 
story is that they were foiling around while the Tartans 
burned up.
All in all the exhibition was very interesting, with the one 
and only Andre bringing down the house.
Captain Mario Monnacchio, coach of the team, is one of the 
lest fencers in the country.
*****
All foul shooters must have their entries for the foul shoot
ing contest in to the Intramural board by Saturday, February 16.
There will be both individual and team competition, and 
the entries must be made separately. In the team event three 
members will be a team with each participant shooting twentyfive fouls. The highest number made out of the possible seventyfive will be the winner.
In order to qualify for the individual finals an entry must 
make fifteen out of twenty-five attempts. The qualifiers will 
shoot fifty fouls each in the finals.
At this writing the entry list is far below expectations. 
If there are not more applicants by Saturday, the tournament 
will not be held. We might add that awards will be given to 
the winners in both classes.
*****
Rube Stark and Barrie Graham had a bet on the Kappa 
Sigma-Delta Tau Delta basketball game. Rube was the official 
scorer for the game. Need we say who won the bet?
Incidentally, the score was 19-18.

Tartan Skaters Win;

Squad Meets Dukes *
At Garden Tonight
Travelling to Cleveland to meet 
the Case hockey team Saturday, 
the Skibo puck'-chasers notched 
their third straight win by a 2-0 
score.
The first period brought numer
ous penalties, but no goals, and 
the second period was nearly 
over before Art Burleigh dented 
the cords on a double assist from 
Schilawske and Wilson. In the 
third session Hollo Block put the 
game on ice, figuratively as well 
as literally, by zipping in a 
wide angle shot for the final 
counter.
Tonight the Skibos take on the 
Duquesne Duk6s and anything is 
liable to happen and probably 
will. Second place in the league 
standings will be at stake, along 
with the Dukes determination to 
redeem the 7-2 trouncing they 
took from Eddie Arsenoult and his 
John Carroll mates last Tuesday.
The Dukes will probably open 
the game with the regular com
bination of Vance, McGill, and 
Foster in the front, Unger and 
Ruscuose at defense, and McMil
lan in the cage. If the cut Mc
Gill received in the Carroll game 
has not healed sufficiently to al
low him to play, he will probably 
be replaced by Scully.
The Tartans will start Sivachek 
at center, Schilawake at left wing, 
and Burleigh on the right. Cap
tain Wilson and Ray Ely on de
fense will team up with Goalie 
Fred Feiler to try to keep the 
Dukes away from the Plaid mesh.
The game starts at 8:30, and the 
25 cent tickets available in t^e 
A. A. office include skating after
wards, so lets get put and give 
the-earn a little of that Skibo sup
port.

Thats how these three members of the U. S'. Antarctic expedition tell of the advantages

flavorful smoke. Id 9H-bsa mile for a Camel. Nothing destroys a cigarettes delicate

You hear about the latest style 
in womens hats, the latest trend 
in mens clothes, and the latest 
word from the front. Now the 
Plaid presents what is undoubted
ly the latest story about a trip to 
Buhl Planetarium.
As you enter the building and 
cross the lobby to the Theater of 
Stars, you are impressed with the 
quiet dignity and beauty of this 
building, dedicated to the myste
ries of the sky. Passing through 
the doors of the sky theater is like 
passing into the outside world. The 
high-domed ceiling creates the im
pression of the sky overhead, and 
the buildings outlined in the dark
ness reminds one of the distant 
horizon. As the time for the per
formance approaches, the light 
fades, the stars appear high in the 
heavens above, and the lecturer 
begins his interesting story of the 
sky. In the background the muted 
strains of beautiful music adds to 
the peacefulness of the scene. As 
the lecturer concludes his story, 
the sky brightens in the east, and 
it is day once more in this msnmade world.
The Hall of Light features ex
hibits of polarized light strain an
alysis, and other displays for the 
scientifically minded. Many of 
these exhibtis explain themselves

Voted Head 
Of Art School
Robert E. Thomson, President of 
the Evening College of Fine Arts, 
needs no introduction to this cam
pus. This is his sixth year in the 
j school and his third year in Even! ing Student Council. He is enroll
ed among the ambitious architects 
in the Arts School and if anyone 
thinks he lacks modern ideas for 
the construction of houses, advice 
is given against letting him start 
on the subject. Bob will receive 
his certificate in Architecture in 
June.
lie enjoys good surroundings and. 
is annoyed at the sight of a lovely 
picture in a poor setting or a com
fortable chair without proper 
lighting conditions. Despite. these 
characteristics, he is not at all the 
arty type but can use a hammeror wrench with skill, even to doing 
the major repair work on his car. 
Incidentally, he has already re
ceived several commercial assign
ments for the design of buildings, 
including those of a church and 
two houses.
Last year Bob served as Social 
Chairman of the Evening School 
and was very successful in this ca
pacity. He was also editor of the 
1939-40 Evening Handbook and 
the fact that the handbook brought 
many compliments to the evening 
school is a tribute to his ability.
This hot tempered young Scotch
man possesses a wealth of infor
mation about many things, includ
ing sports events, orchestras, ra
dios and shows. He is popular be
yond those of his own age, older 
folks always welcoming him as a 
guest.
Bdb and Miss Louise McAdams 
announced their engagement dur
ing the Christmas season and ex
pect to be married late this sum
mer. Their home will surely reflect the good taste of an architect.

Soft Light of Love 
In Ladies Eyes
Somewhere, no doubt, the bright 
lights blazed last Saturday even
ing . . . but not in Thistle Hall. 
In Thistle Hall, soft lights glowed 
in a frothy welter of frills and 
stuff, white lies and silly, senti
mental mush filled the air, and 
couples danced closer and closer 
and closer. It was the night of the 
Vocationals groups celebrated 
Valentine Dance.
Bill LeBoy and his band fur
nished the music, but it might 
have been Dan Cupid himself, so 
soft and romantic were the melo
dies. Romance was in the air . . . 
and in the eyes and hearts of the 
dancers. Well, some of them, any
way.
Decorations, believe it or not, 
had a lot of red in them. Hearts 
and streamers of red and white 
crepe paper decorated the walls 
and band stand. Ruby lights shone 
here and there, and the crystal ball 
whirled and whirled . . . and tjie 
dancers whirled and whirled.
Fresh flower corsages were given 
at the door to the first 200 fair la
dies to arrive.
Prior to the dance, publicity was 
given to a movement to get the 
feminine element back t'o the ro
mantic atmosphere of long gowns. 
Whether the movement or the 
spirit oftheseason-aiTected the 
dance, everyone looked beautiful 
and many persons had a, good time.
And so to bed!

house Swing Choir of 24 male and 
female voices capably handle the 
vocal passages.
Musical comment is by the in

spacious studios to handle the pro
gram is aired from Syria Mosque.
Students may attend the Pacific 
Coast broadcast which commences 
at 11:30 p. m. However, guests 
must be in their seats by 11:20 so 
that there will be no hitch in the 
split-second schedule.
Tickets are available at the Reg

Signs Needed 
For Affairs
Its a well known fact that only 
a select group seem to know about 
the night school dances. Adver
tising is needed in the way of 
signs, particularly for the Wash
ington Birthday dance sponsored 
by the Evening Student Council, 
and the Evening College of En
gineering dance. These are to be 
held on March 2nd and March 9th 
respectively in Thistle Hall, or
chestra to be announced later, 
usual price of one dollar per 
couple.
For the, information of those 
who hhve not had any previous 
experience in making signs for 
dances, these posters should in
clude information regarding the 
date and time, place, price, or
chestra, sponsor, and type of 
dance. Signs should be turned in 
at Night School Registrar's of
fice.
Handbooks Are 
At Registrars
All students who registered for 
Carnegie Evening Colleges at; 
Mid-term should obtain their 
hand books as soon as possible. 
The handbook briefly summarizes 
the History of Carnegie Tech, lists 
the sociitl organizations, outlines 
the set-up of self-government of 
the evening colleges, and con
tains a schedule of all extra-cur
ricular activities.
The handbook will prove in
valuable to those who are plan
ning to take a part in the vari
ous campus activities. Although 
they were not available on regis
tration night they may now be ob
tained at the Registrars office.
