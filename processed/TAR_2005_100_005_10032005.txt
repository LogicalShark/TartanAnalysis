Tepper ranks third 
for recruitment
by J.T. Trollman
Editor-in-Chief
Degrees from the Tepper 
School of Business , just became 
much more valuable. The third 
most valuable, to be exact  both 
in the country and in the world.
In their September 21 issue, The 
Wall Street Journal listed CMUs 
Tepper School third in both the 
national and international catego
ries for business school rankings. 
The rankings measured how ap
pealing the schools are to recruit
ers  the buyers of MBA tal
ent. Of all schools ranked, only 
the Tepper School and Mexicos 
Instituto Panamericano de Alta 
Direccin de Empresa (IPADE) 
placed in multiple categories.
The ranking comes almost two 
years after alumnus David Tepper 
donated $55 million to CMUs for
mer Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration (GSIA), renaming 
it the Tepper School of Business. 
It also comes after the Tepper 
Schools MBA program shrank 
from 500 graduating students to 
315, the Journal reported, to re
duce class sizes and lessen the 
strain on the faculty.
I can definitely tell a better 
quality of students actually enter
ing the business school, which 
is kind of unusual, said Arish 
Gupta, president of CMUs Omega 
Psi chapter of the Alpha Kappa Psi 
coed business fraternity. Being 
a business fraternity, you get to 
see which freshmen are really 
engaged ... and this freshman

class is really engaged on cam
pus. Just looking at their class, its 
developed really well.
Gupta commented on how 
the majority of the fraternitys 
seniors have been able to secure 
internships and positions at the 
nations top banking firms as 
a result of the Tepper Schools 
worth in the industry. With 
this improvement, he said, it < 
really pushes us ahead. In par
ticular, Gupta singled out the 
schools Information Systems and 
Management and Information 
Systems^ (MISM) programs as 
being among the most successful.

ate of the Tepper School and now

Ladner raises questions on college budgets
Gas prices 
rise, school 
days decreaseA new kind of vote
CMU launches deliberative poll on Oct. 29
by Dorian Adeyemi
Junior Staffwriter
Over the last few weeks, gas 
prices have increased, though 
the rise slowed with the intro
duction of millions of barrels of 
oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve and other donor nations. 
Regardless, communities across 
the nation are beginning to feel 
the pressure that higher gas prices 
are exerting.
These woes have caused some 
people to think up of ways to 
save money. According to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the 
superintendent of the Brownsville 
Area School District, Lawrence L. 
Golembiewski, has come up with 
an idea that he says could save his 
district up to $1.2 million a year. 
His plan is to shorten the school 
week to four days and make each 
school day longer for his district,, 
which lies about 40 miles sotlth of 
Pittsburgh.
The . superintendent has con
tacted the state Department of 
Education for permission to imple
ment the plan. Golembiewski has 
said that the reason for the plan is 
a matter of dollars and cents, argu
ing that the increase in fuel prices 
has also increased the prices of 
other services and that Hurricane 
Katrina only made things worse. 
The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review re
ported Golembiewski as saying 
that by going to a four-day week, 
the school district could cut down 
costs for transportation, utilities, 
and food costs, potentially saving
 up to 20 percent of the districts 
operating budget.
This is the first request of its 
kind in the history of Pennsylvania. 
State education officials have in
dicated that all school districts 
in Pennsylvania use the con
ventional five-day school week. 
According to the Tribune-Review, 
Mike Storm, a spokesman for the 
state Department of Education, 
said, The governor and the 
Department of Education both 
understand and are also con
cerned about the energy costs for

The issue: unengaged, uninformed citizens. The 
remedy: deliberative polling.
On Saturday, October 29, a week-long commu
nity summit on campus will culminate in Carnegie 
Mellons first deliberative poll through the South
western Pennsylvania Program for Deliberative 
Democracy. A random but representative sampling 
of community members from Allegheny County 
will discuss and respond to questions on local, re
gional, or national issues. Through this poll, the 
Program for Deliberative Democracy (a partner
ship between Carnegie Mellon and the Carnegie 
Library) hopes to raise the level of campus-wide 
discussions on important issues and stress the 
merits of campus diversity.
Deliberative polling (as headed by the Center 
for Deliberative Polling) was first presented by
Center director James S. Fishkin in the late 1980s, 
spurred by his perception of citizens failure to 
make informed decisions on important issues.
In a 1996 interview with Joseph Straw of the 
New Haven Register, Fishkin said that public opin
ion polls show what people think when they dont 
think.
The idea of deliberative polling was not actually 
implemented until the early 1990s in Great Britain. 
The first deliberative poll in the U.S. took place at 
the University of Texas during the 1996 election, 
with issues ranging from abortion to taxes. Two 
hundred and forty individuals participated. Gen
eral issues of polls that have since been conducted 
include education (conducted by the Nike Foun
dation and Oregon Public Broadcasting in 1999) 
and economic relations between New Haven city 
and suburbs (conducted by Yale in 2002).

Students from Texas 
narrowly escape Rita
by Matthew Campbell
Junior Staffwriter
As, the Gulf Coast began to re
cover from the disaster wrought 
by Hurricane Katrina a month 
ago, progress was threatened by 
another powerful hurricane, Rita. 
Rita was expected to hit Houston, 
Texas on Saturday September 24, 
and exacerbate the flooding of 
New Orleans.
However, because of the les
sons that Katrina provided to the 
Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) and local gov
ernments, the damage from Rita 
across both Texas and Louisiana 
was minimal.
People living in New Orleans 
and other areas prone to hurri
canes are accustomed to coping 
with extreme weather. Ryan
Sakauye, a first-year from New 
Orleans, says that in the past, 
major hurricanes were always 
supposed to hit, but at the last 
moment they always turned 
away. New Orleans was also 
shielded by a levee system which 
was designed to protect the city 
from Category 3 hurricanes.
Once it became apparent that 
Katrina was going to make land
fall as a Category 4 storm, peo
ple recognized the potential for 
disaster. The call for voluntary 
evacuation from New Orleans 
turned into an order for manda
tory evacuation the day before 
the hurricane made landfall. The 
people who were left were the 
ones without means  transpor
tation or money  to evacuate. 
Many were trapped in the city.

Bradford L. Yankiver
My friend Jared Branfman and his 
family are easy to love. I went to high 
school with Jared and his brother 
Adam. I became close to their family 
quickly. When I started spending as 
much time at their house as my own 
one summer, Jareds mother, Ellen, 
started calling me their third son.
For two years and three months 
now, Jared valiantly fought a rare form 
of cancer. Recently, though, Jared 
learned that his treatment options had 
been exhausted.
Last week, Jared passed away after a 
more-than-two-year struggle with can
cer. I was honored to be able to spend 
the last weeks, days, and minutes of 
Jareds life with him and his family.
Now, we grieve and find a new way 
to live.
As I began to process this experience, 
I realized how removed I am from the 
notion of death. Mortality, perhaps 
our most intrinsic trait, is foreign to so 
many of us.
For years, my mother warned me 
that I wasnt invincible. Never breaking 
a bone, never visiting the emergency 
room, I found it difficult to consider or 
even conceive of the end of life. I expe
rienced the loss of three grandparents, 
but death still seemed a very abstract 
and distant phenomenon. Only the 
' most direct confrontations with death 
have led me to accept it as an intrinsic 
part of life.
The summer after graduating high 
school, I began working the graveyard 
shift at an emergency room south of 
Boston. Along with many menial du
ties, I was responsible for being the 
extra hands of doctors and surgeons in 
the trauma room.
I cant remember specifically when 
I first witnessed a persons death, 
but I remember that it wasnt what I 
expected: It was unremarkable and 
natural. Death was not dramatic or 
frightening, as television and movies 
had led me to believe.
I was present for the passings of 
many people, but it was one case in 
particular that forced me to confront 
the fact that what I witnessed happen
ing to others applied to me, too.
A young man was once brought to 
the emergency room after becoming 
unconscious at a party. He had been 
using the drug called Special K  ketamine. I searched through his pockets 
for identification and found his drivers 
license. He was 18 years old  just a 
few months younger than I was.
The boys heart stopped beating 
shortly after he arrived. Staring at him, 
something clicked. Quickly, the calm 
disconnect that I inherited from my 
colleagues and my culture washed over 
me. That feeling scared me more than 
the experience itself.
Friends and family would react with 
surprise and aversion when I told them 
about my job. Death isnt something 
people my age should have to deal 
with, nearly all of them said. It is the 
same reaction I got when friends and 
family spoke to me about my grand
parents deaths. I cant help but feel 
that this choreographed response re
flects our cultures practice of ignoring 
death, denying for as long as possible 
its inevitability.
Of course, life experiences and grad
ual exposure can. soften the blow dealt 
by the realities of our mortal condition, 
but avoiding the issue does more harm 
than good. Accepting life for what it is 
need not be morbid; it is brave, and it 
is healthy.
For many of us in our late teens and 
early twenties, the loss of a loved one 
who is close to us in age is not within 
our experience set. Naturally, the emo
tions that come with that loss are new 
and confusing. Most important is that 
we accept and address our feelings. 
As I came to realize these things, I 
also realized that Jared knew them. He 
lived every moment looking forward. 
He laughed and loved every day.
Jareds life was as short as a beat of 
a blue jays wing  and as vigorous. 
His life was as long as the suns  and 
as brilliant. Jared, you are with us 
always.

Rita damage not as 
extensive as expected
RITA, from Al
According to recent estimates 
reported by the Associated Press 
and USA Today, Katrina cost $60 
billion in damage and over 1000 
lives to date. This is financially 
much worse than the previous 
most costly hurricane, Andrew, 
which caused $35 billion in 
damage to areas of Florida. New 
Orleans is asking Congress for 
$20.2 billion in federal aid in or
der to repair and upgrade their 
levee system, so that they can 
hope to deal, with Category 5 
storms.
For all the damage done, many 
people are optimistic about re
building New Orleans. Sakauye 
thinks that in the long term, 
things will get back to normal. I 
think a lot of people arent going 
to return until the economy re
covers, he said, which will be 
a long time.
As for the inhabitants of the 
Gulf Coast, a major hurricane 
like Rita (which was brew
ing in the Gulf of Mexico as a 
Category 5 storm) was a new 
experience for many Texans, in
cluding the parents of first-year 
Jeanette Schilling. Schillings 
parents intended to leave Hous
ton by car for a hotel in Arkansas
(it was the nearest they could 
book) the morning of the hur
ricane. However, they heard on 
the news that the roads were too 
jammed with traffic and that it 
was too late to evacuate. Three 
million of Houstons inhabitants 
and more along the Louisiana 
coastline did evacuate, avert
ing major casualties from the 
storm.
I was really worried about 
my parents because of what hap
pened in New Orleans with Hur
ricane Katrina, said Schilling, 
whose parents are unharmed.
Rita turned out to be one of 
Sakauyes typical hurricanes: 
a powerful hurricane that 
downgraded at the last minute. 
It made landfall as a Category 3 
hurricane, and missed Houston 
and most densely populated 
areas. Afterwards, the Armys 
rescue efforts quickly changed 
to focus on stranded cattle, 
rather than humans.
According to Associated Press 
reports, estimates of the dam
age caused by Rita on insured 
property range from $2.5 to 
$5 billion. Although there were 
only seven casualties due to the 
hurricane, there were dozens 
of accidental deaths associated 
with the evacuation.
Wall Street Journal 
ranks Tepper third
RANKING, from A1
number of CMU graduates who 
returned during the schools 
recent Technical Opportunities 
Conference proved how highly 
IBM valued Tepper students.
I know IBM had 10 people 
this year standing at our booth, 
said DiVenere, and a lot of 
them were recent grads. So that 
speaks a lot about the percent
age of new hires that theyre 
hiring coming from CMU. They 
[IBM] probably hire a lot more 
students from CMU than other
schools. IBM was only one 
of several large corporations 
recruiting at this past weeks 
Opportunities Conferences.
Kenneth B. Dunn, the Tepper 
Schools dean and a professor 
of financial economics, could 
not be reached for comment. 
However, Gupta noted that this 
ranking put the Tepper School in 
a srong place in relation to other 
peer universities. This makes 
us stronger as a whole, he said, 
both in terms of our status as 
a business school and [in terms 
of] actual recruitment.
School super may reduce school week to fight gas prices
DISTRICT, from Al
the school districts, but at this 
stage the four-day school week 
is something thats simply un
der consideration and is being 
looked at.
State law requires that school 
districts provide at least 180 days 
of school every year. However, 
schools are permitted to count 
that in hours, with Department 
of Education permission. To meet 
that requirement, Golembiewski 
proposed increasing each school
day by one hour and 45 min
utes.
The only possible hurdles 
to overcome would be that of 
possible contractual difficulties 
with the teaching union. The 
Post-Gazette reported that Wythe 
Keever, a spokesman for the 
Pennsylvania State Education 
Association, said, As far as con
tractual obligations, our view 
would be that the local asso
ciations current collective bar
gaining agreement would still 
be binding.... Any change in the
school calendar that affects hours 
of employment would have to be 
negotiated with the union. 
Pittsburgh has for the last sev
eral years had budgetary diffi
culties, raising the question of 
whether or not the city would 
need to take such drastic action. 
When questioned on the topic, 
Pittsburgh superintendent Mark 
Roosevelt said, No, Pittsburgh 
will not go to such a plan unless 
our fiscal situation deteriorated 
to a point where it was an abso
lute necessity. And even then I
am not sure. Why? Because we 
need much more time on learn
ing and if we are able to expand 
the school day then we will use it 
to expand our students work, not 
cut off a day. Roosevelt added, 
What would parents do with 
their children on the off day?
CMU officials were not avail
able for comment on whether or 
not these changes could extend 
to the University.
As of press time, the state is 
still reviewing the legality of 
Golembiewskis proposal.

Higher academic standards are good for everyone
What a child learns today could have a major effect tomorrow. Not just on him or her, but on the rest of 
the world. Your world. Since 1992, we've worked to raise academic standards. Because quite simply

will include health care costs, 
services for the uninsured, health 
care for the elderly, better health 
care practices, and the impact 
of both the reduction of federal 
Medicaid funds and advances in 
treatment. Topics in a single poll
ing can range from human rights 
to foreign policy to domestic 
issues.
This is not the first deliberative 
poll that Pittsburgh has hosted. In 
2004, the city was one of ten na
tionwide to take part in a deliber
ative poll titled Americas Role in 
the World, a discussion and poll 
on country and worldwide issues, 
including national security and 
global trade.
The process is simple: Indi
viduals from a random sample 
answer questions about certain 
issues. They then gather together 
in small groups for moderated 
discussion. Individuals are also 
given the opportunity to ques
tion political leaders. Following 
the discussion and questioning, 
members are asked to answer the 
same questions as before.
But does it actually affect 
peoples opinions? Yes, according
to the statistical data provided by 
the Center for Deliberative Poll
ing.
In a 2003 overview of the delib
erative poll held in Philadelphia, 
those in favor of increased for
eign aid spending increased from 
20 percent to 53 percent over 
the course of the poll. Results for
redevelopment of Lower Manhat
tan. Additionally, Global Voices is 
a company whose program allows 
people to gather in 21st Cen
tury Town Meetings to discuss 
issues. Individuals opinions are 
recorded on laptops and shared 
with political leaders.

Deborah Moon, the chief finan
cial officer and vice-president of 
Carnegie Mellon, is another inte
gral figure in managing Carnegie 
Mellons funds.
Moon, Provost Mark Kamlet, 
and,President Cohon compose a 
group that is formally in charge 
of how the University spends its 
money, according to the afore
mentioned Responsibility of As
sets policy.
Moon reports that a Compensa
tion Committee within the Board 
of Trustees monitors President 
Cohons compensation. The BOT 
carefully considers comparative 
data of peer institutions when set
ting the Presidents salary, says
Moon.
Erroneous spending with Uni
versity funds may lead to IRS pen
alties for breaking certain rules 
associated with being a nonprofit 
entity. American University may 
incur these penalties as a result of 
Ladners actions.
In the last fiscal year for which 
records are available, *2003 
(defined as July 1, 2003, to 
June 30, 2004), President Cohon 
made $429,230, with $53,675 in 
expense accounts and other un
specified allowances.
The purchases Cohon made 
with this money could not be ac
counted for by the time of press. 
However, according to Moon, He 
follows our policies to a T. Every
one from staff accountants to the 
President is under the same tight
scrutiny.
Meanwhile, the American 
University campus community, 
including faculty, staff and stu
dents, is expressing outrage 
against the scandal.
A lot of students feel that 
theyve been gypped. Professors 
are angry too, said American 
University first-year Cecilia Campbell-Westlind, who has witnessed 
several anti-Ladner rallies.
One such rally occurred 
Wednesday night, when approxi
mately 500 students marched 
through a university building 
where the trustees were holding 
a meeting.
Campbell-Westlind added, I 
hope he gets fired.
President Cohon was not avail
able for comment at press time.

Over the past 15 years, 
Carnegie Mellon has increased 
its efforts to preserve the envi
ronment. They have adopted a 
formal recycling policy and have 
been holding public awareness 
events like the annual Energy 
Fest. CMUs most recent proj
ect, in collaboration with Green 
Practices, is the Hamerschlag 
Hall Green Roof. The addition to 
the building is an example of us
ing earth-friendly technology to 
solve an earth-threatening prob
lem.
The design for Hamerschlag 
Halls Green Roof began two 
years after the formation of 
Green Practices in 1999, a com
mittee to increase environmental 
practices and programs on cam
pus. The project itself started as 
a Small Undergraduate Research 
Grant proposal by three under
graduate students.
At the Green Roof opening on 
Friday, President Jared Cohon 
and a Channel 4 news helicopter 
were present to mark the event. 
The Tartan caught up with Diane 
Loviglio, the creator of the Green 
Roof Initiative team. She called 
the Green Roof project genu
ine, saying, It was the students 
involvement and passion that 
started it and kept it running, not 
the idea or donation from a big 
wealthy corporation.
Green roofs provide several 
environmental and human 
health benefits; By replacing 
heat-absorbing tar with plants 
and grasses, green roof builders 
can substantially mitigate the 
phenomenon known as urban 
heat-island effect, when urban 
areas are up to 7 F warmer than 
the surrounding areas. Increased 
heat contributes to smog and cre
ates greater demands for energy.

This week, How Things 
Work is going to set the record 
straight on how to operate an 
abacus in the unfortunate event 
that your graphing calculator 
dies during your mathematics 
exam.
An abacus is a calcula
tion tool that was commonly 
used by the Chinese as early 
as the year 3000 BCE and the 
Babylonians in 2400 BCE. The 
concept of a mechanistic count
ing device gained widespread 
appeal, giving rise to the Japa
nese abacus, the Roman aba
cus, the Greek abacus, the Rus
sian abacus, the Danish abacus, 
the Native American abacus, 
and the Abacus for the Visually 
Impaired.
Unfortunately there is no 
Pittsburgh abacus, so the fol
lowing directions will assume 
that the reader is acquainted 
with the popular Chinese 
model.
An abacus consists of a series 
of parallel rods held together by 
a rectangular wooden frame. 
A horizontal beam divides the 
frame into an upper deck and a 
lower deck. Each rod holds five 
beads  one on the top deck 
and four on the bottom. The 
number of rods can vary from 
one abacus to the next, but 
most are equipped with at least 
10. An abacus with 45 beads 
can thus be used to represent

by the Information Networking 
Institute (INI), part of a masters 
program offered here in Pitts
burgh and at the Hyogo Institute 
of Information Education Foun
dation in Kobe.
The INI is a leader in connect
ing students in remote locations 
with Carnegie Mellons learning 
environment. The INI has set up 
a masters program in informa
tion networking and technology 
in Athens, Greece as well as in
It has built-in instruments that 
study the performance of the 
roof with respect to stormwater 
flow and quantity, energy use 
in the building, and the urban 
heat-island effect. Cliff David
son, a professor of Civil and En
vironmental Engineering, led a 
team of students in building the 
instruments.
Building these green houses is 
challenging, says Green Prac
tices intern Ryan England, who 
worked under Davidson to help 
build the measurement instru
mentation. The equipment is 
embedded in the roof, and we 
are hoping it will continue to 
feed us data for the next couple
numbers as high as 999,999,999
 which is quite impressive.
Although abaci were primar
ily used to count merchandise 
and animals, this shouldnt 
discourage the reader from us
ing them to solve differential 
equations.
To set the abacus to zero, all 
of the beads are pushed towards 
the outer, frame, exposing the 
central bar. Beads are count
ed the moment they touch 
the central bar. The rightmost 
column of beads is -designated

column represents the tens col

Kobe.
The Athens program started 
three years ago to simultane
ously teach students at CMU and 
in Greece cutting edge technolo
gies. The INI has since expanded 
the program to include Kobe. 
These programs are referred to as 
hybrid distance education mod
els because while the professors 
teach the core degree classes at 
CMU, they also go to the remote 
location several times a semesof years.
The Carnegie Mellon team 
and the Green Practices Com
mittee are not the only organiza
tions that are beginning to build 
rooftop gardens on campus. Yale 
University and Swarthmore 
College have also implemented 
rooftop gardens in their cam
puses.
Davidson placed emphasis 
on the continuing efforts that 
Carnegie Mellon and its com
munity can make to help the 
environment. Carpool, drive 
less, lobby city officials for bet
ter public transportation, he 
said. Other small things like not 
littering, gardening, lowering'

Beads on the bottom deck 
have single digit values, while 
those on the top deck are 
given a value of five. The num
ber 1 is represented by sliding 
the top bead on the rightmost 
column up to meet the hori
zontal bar. The numbers two, 
three, and four can be formed by 
joining one, two, or three beads, 
respectively, to the first bead. 
For the number five, the lone

less meat, eating organic foods, 
promoting environmentally 
friendly food like fruits and 
vegetables at meetings, and

make all the difference. David

tion and public awareness peo
ple will realize what a difference 
they can make preserving the 
environment.

formed by again raising beads 
on the bottom deck to meet 
the central bar.
In this manner, numbers get 
larger and larger as you prog
ress further and further to the 
left. The number 999,999,999 
can be formed by pushing all 
45 beads against the central 
bar so that none of them are in 
contact with the outer frame.
Still, your abacus will be 
of no help on your astrophys
ics final unless you can per
form higher calculations. To 
do this, it is necessary to learn 
a host of finger, techniques.
On the Chinese abacus, addi
tion is performed by moving 
beads up with the thumb 
and down with the index fin
ger. Some complex operations 
require the index finger to move 
the beads up, however. Fail
ure to switch fingers will ruin ' 
your calculation and offend the 
abacus-using community.
Theoretically, it is possible 
to perform almost any math
ematical functon on the aba
cus. One can do multiplication, 
division, square root calcula
tions, or cube root calcula
tions. Those of you willing to 
master these techniques may  
want to read Lee Kai-Chens 
How to Learn Lees Abacus.
I can take triple integrals on 
abaci in my sleep, but it looks 
like Ive run out of space to 
go into it here. I hope you re
membered extra batteries.

Arctic ice caps will

In nature, a few things, including

ly photographed a live giant squid. 
At a depth of 900 meters beneath 
sea level, they baited Architeuthis 
and captured the first images of a 
giant squid in its natural habitat.

Webconferencing classes bridge cultures in classrooms
VIDEO, from A6
instructor over there, but Im the 
one who gives all the lectures. 
Trying to teach globally does 
presents cultural problems. I 
think I have to be a little bit more 
conscientious in terms of paying 
more attention to the Kobe side 
of the classroom, Wong said; 
students [atCMU] are very, very 
vocal.... I have to remember to 
engage the Japan side, too, and 
call on them. Part of it is the cul
tural differences. People here are 
not very shy, and [the students in 
Kobe] are more shy. They dont 
want to interrupt because they 
feel like it is rude, so I have to tell 
them, If you have any comments 
or questions, dont feel like you 
are interrupting me. You are par
ticipating in class and we have 
a small class, so you want to be 
interactive. 
Students made less of the cul
ture barriers and saw them as a 
learning experience. The cul
tural differences are an added 
bonus to the class. It gives us an 
opportunity to become famil
iar with other environments, 
B.J. Bayha, a masters student at 
CMU, said of the experience.
Parts of the communication 
problems were technical. Steph
anie Weber, Instruction Support 
Specialist for the INI, explained 
the situation in the remote loca
tions: In Athens, they have wire
less microphones, so something 
as simple as being able to ask a 
question, if you have to pass the 
mike... [Students] dont want 
to interrupt that class, but they 
would have to. Maybe it would 
take a split second, but those 
seconds add up. That was a big 
challenge.
The problem persisted at the 
Kobe location. We dont really 
have a chance to speak up in the 
class, said Keiji Takeda, an ad
junct professor in Kobe.
CMU has been able to solve 
the communications problem at 
the Pittsburgh end by utilizing 
microphones that zoom in on 
the speaker. These microphones 
simulate a face-to-face experi
ence for students in the remote 
locations. There is a connected
ness that was difficult at the be
ginning, Weber said.
The courses taught in Athens 
and Kobe are graduate-level 
classes, but that is not to say that 
the international format would 
not be of value to undergradu
ates. I definitely think it could 
work at the undergraduate lev
el, Weber said.
CMU seems to have counted 
on undergraduate interest, with 
wildly successful results. This 
semester sees CMU offering its 
first joint Pittsburgh-Qatar class, 
American-Arab Encounters, uti
lizing the newest web camera 
videoconferencing technology, 
similar to the INI courses.
The course explores the re
lationship between the United 
States and the Arab countries 
of the Middle East. However, its 
primary focus is on promoting 
interactions and understanding 
between people from multiple 
cultural backgrounds in the Mid
dle East and the U.S. The experi
ence is incredibly hands-on.
We are totally embracing 
technology, said professor Lau
rie Eisenberg, the Pittsburgh co
instructor. It is incredible how 
we are using the newest techno
logical capabilities and applying 
them in the humanities.
Professor Ben Riley is the co
instructor at the Qatar campus. 
Over the summer, Eisenberg and 
Riley put together a syllabus for 
the course while Riley was visit
ing CMU. Both professors work 
together during class time to 
facilitate discussion. Their ap
proach to teaching is organized 
and cooperative, with each tak
ing turns leading lectures. The 
result has worked very well.
Since September 11, conflicts 
have arisen between Arabs and 
Americans. The resulting opin
ions and biases are based on 
media portrayals and on infor
mation from our surroundings. 
Young people from each region 
seldom have the opportunity 
to hear what the other has to 
say. Our goal is to let Arabs 
and Americans speak with one 
another, giving them the schol
arly and historical background 
to induce intellectual, informed 
discussions, said Eisenberg, 
who specializes in Middle East 
relations. Communications tech
nology has allowed the bridging

of culture and knowledge like no

For example, Qatar students 
will not attend class on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. Similarly, 
Pittsburgh students will not at
tend class during the two-week 
break given during Ramadan.
In addition to utilizing ad
vanced technology during class, 
students are required to spend 
two hours a week in an outside 
discussion group facilitated by 
soliya.net, a nonprofit group 
focused on improving ArabAmerican relations. Students use 
web cameras to engage in video
conferenced conversation with 
groups of eight students from 
Arab and U.S. universities.
This experience has been 
priceless, Eisenberg said about 
the course. As a historian, I like 
to work with primary source 
documents. Hearing what the 
students have to say is like oral 
history, we are capturing in a 
sense the feelings and opinions 
that are prevalent in the Arab 
world. It is terrific to let the stu
dents speak for themselves.
The cultural exchange has got
ten much positive feedback. It 
is really important to exchange

ideas and learn from each other, 
said Noura Alsubai, a student at 
the Qatar campus. This course 
is unique because I can see oth
er points of view, open my eyes 
to things I didnt know, and get 
views other than what I see in 
the media and the movies. 
Pittsburgh students feel the 
same way. I was interested in 
taking this course because it was 
something groundbreaking, 
said Joe Phillips. I was curious 
to see how utilizing the newest 
technological tools would struc
ture this course, and it is very rel
evant to current events and cur
rent U.S. policy. My knowledge 
of the Arab world and American 
policy has expanded greatly. 
Aroon Pahwa, on the other 
hand, is taking this course for 
more personal interests. Qatar 
is a developing area with lots of 
business opportunities. I wanted 
to get a chance to meet people 
over there and get contacts. 
Students have found Ameri
can-Arab Encounters interesting 
because of the amount of student-to-student interaction. Be
ing able to see the other students 
through the video conferencing 
really gives a human face to the
other sides argument and per
spective, said Phillips. Its not 
just a difference of ideas, its a 
real issue, and it is interesting to 
see the human aspect of it.
For many students, the course 
is their first chance to utilize the 
newest advances in communica
tions technology. Im so happy 
to be one of the first to see this 
happen, said J.B. Galloway, 
a Pittsburgh student. Its like 
an urban myth. It is amazing to 
actually have a class where this 
kind of technology is implement
ed.
Regular interaction with 
our international counterparts 
may be around the corner for 
more CMU students, and not 
just online or onscreen. Athens 
students have come to CMU 
for the summer and student ex
change programs with the Qatar 
campus are in full swing. Its a 
great program, Weber said.Its 
really fascinating to watch it 
grow and change, especially 
with the technology and being 
at Carnegie Mellon. There is no 
better place to be.

Pittsburghs 
SciTech 
Spectacular
SPECTACULAR, from A6
America will have a robot by 
2050.
October 5: Kerien W. Fitzpat
rick, the president of Hyperactive 
Technologies and a co-founder of 
Carnegie Mellons National Ro
botics Engineering Consortium, 
will be lecturing about fast food. 
Hyperactive recently teamed up 
with several Pittsburgh fast food 
eateries to predict what food or
ders will be placed based on a 
customers vehicle. If the camerabot senses a minivan entering the 
drive-thru, it knows that the food 
order is likely to be big. For the 
customer, the food is prepared 
faster. For the company, costs 
drop dramatically.
Green Chemistry
October 6: Deboshri Banerjee, a CMU doctoral candidate in 
chemistry, will give a presentation 
about the future of green chemis
try in cleaning up toxic waste that 
poses a threat to human health or 
the environment. Her research 
focuses on synthesizing and opti
mizing the use of Fe-TAML activa
tors, which, when combined with 
organic peroxides, destroy envi
ronmental contaminants, making 
them less or non-toxic.
Advances in Architechture
October 4: Dr. Khee Poh Lam, 
a professor of architecture at 
CMUs Center for Building Perfor
mance and Diagnostics, will talk 
about how Pittsburgh is a nation
al leader in green architecture. 
The lecture will focus on highperformance building materials, 
from stand-alone solar panels to 
CMUs entry in the 2005 Solar 
Decathlon.
The SciTech Spectacular runs 
from September 30 to October 9 at 
the Carnegie Science Center. Learn

What would Flying Spaghetti Monster do?
Intelligent design should open the door for Pastafarianism, too
Dover, Pa., is a small town, just west 
of York and a little south of Harrisburg. 
The school district there has some 2800 
students in grades K through 12, students 
who are much like us. Except for one 
thing: When these students reach the 
ninth grade, their biology classes will in
clude the subject of intelligent design, 
a non-scientific theory that tries to teach 
creationism, only using secular terms.
Theyre joined by various students 
from Ohio, New Mexico, Wisconsin, 
Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland, Illinois, 
Montana, and Kansas in having their 
First Amendment rights threatened by 
school board members who cant tell the 
difference between church and state.
Certainly, its only expected that 
groups like the American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU) have stepped in to try and 
stop this; just last week, they welcomed 
a federal judges ruling that a trial 
challenging the Dover case would go for
ward. However, an Oregon State gradu
ate with a physics degree is presenting 
a slightly more interesting challenge.
His name is Bobby Henderson, and he 
believes in Pastafarianism: the church of 
the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
Since intelligent design involves 
secular terms and includes as many 
diverse viewpoints as possible,
Henderson wrote to the aforementioned 
school districts asking that his view of 
intelligent design be included as well. 
According to Henderson, the universe 
was created by a Flying Spaghetti Mon
ster. His Noodly Master, furthermore, 
has deliberately planted any evidence of 
evolution that we naive humans might 
find. Devoted practitioners of the re
ligion wear full pirate regalia, end all 
their. prayers with Ramen instead 
of Amen, and are convinced that all 
of creation has been touched by His 
Noodly Appendage.
If anyone is still in doubt of the merits 
of Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, consider 
this: According to the churchs website, 
Our heaven is WAY better. Weve got a 
Stripper Factory AND a Beer Volcano. 
Hendersons blatantly constructed
protest against this clumsy inser
tion of religion into our education 
system is clever, but poignant as well. 
Its hard to deny Hendersons genius. 
Hes single-handedly managed to pin
point the weaknesses of intelligent 
design, and, like a true prophet, has 
gained quite a following in the process. 
When school boards promote intelli
gent design, their open-mindedness 
probably doesnt extend past traditional 
creationism; now His Noodly Master 
is forcing them to contend with their 
own folly.
Intelligent design, as it stands now, 
isnt much more than a thinly veiled at
tempt at feeding creationist theories to 
students who may not know any better. 
However, if supporters truly wish to 
uphold the more admirable ideal of 
pluralism by promoting a number of 
theories, they would do well to include 
Flying Spaghetti Monsterism. Theres 
no telling how many school kids may 
be touched and inspired by His Noodly 
Appendage.
CNN: You are not the Celebrity News Network
Recently, America has seen an out
break of pregnant celebrities. Perhaps 
you didnt realize America has been 
flooded with beautiful bundles of joy. 
Perhaps you live under a rock.
Celebrities arent just having babies, 
either. Theyre getting married. Theyre 
getting divorced. According to some of 
the top news sources, some of them even 
breathe on their own. Theyre that im
portant.
If youre jealous because The Tartan is 
privy to this classified information, dont 
be  stop and look at any accredited 
news source and see for yourself. Media 
companies, especially those online, treat 
celebrity information as though it were 
life-altering news. Celebrity families used 
to be off the radar and off-limits to the 
rest of society. But today, the American 
media has become paparazzi of prose, 
writing about anything celebrities do 
that might be deemed newsworthy. News 
flash: its not.
Jennifer Garners baby might as well 
be named Mark Felt, because when she 
inadvertently revealed the sex of her 
expected child on The Tonight Show, the 
media acted as if the revelation were 
Deep Throat himself.
When Britney Spears delivered hr 
first baby a few weeks ago, the media
treated it as though two Middle Eastern 
countries signed a historic peace treaty 
named Sean Preston.
Finally, amid its top headlines last 
Saturday, including U.S. launches 
Operation Iron Fist in Iraq, CNN.com 
read Report: Paris Hilton breaks off 
engagement. Its a good thing CNN 
had the foresight to report the marriage 
status of a woman whose most notable 
accomplishment is starring in a home
made sex tape.
It would be one thing if breaking 
celebrity news were restricted to tab
loids that focus on entertainment, but 
the aforementioned stories were all As
sociated Press stories included on the 
websites of such top news sources as 
CNN and MSNBC. Is there not enough 
news in America and around the world 
to report on that the Associated Press has 
to assign trained journalists to cover the 
private lives of celebrities?
Perhaps its especially poignant that 
California governor Arnold Schwar
zenegger (a celebrity himself) just signed 
an anti-paparazzi bill into law that puts 
harsher restrictions on those camera 
jockeys who are always sticking their 
flashes in celebrity faces for People, Star, 
and the like. We live in a country where 
laws like this are needed. How sad is
that?
Meanwhile, in a public statement 
released over the weekend, the 
Associated Press revealed it will be 
breaking off its commitment to report
ing important news. It hopes people 
will respect its privacy during this emo
tional time.
Friitnrial Dissent
Celebrity self-promotion is annoy
ing. It is a cancer on society that has 
only been fueled by the rise of reality 
television. However, what about the 
celebrities that have no choice but to be 
in the spotlight?
A prime example is the recent 
wedding of Demi Moore and Ashton 
Kutcher. Demi and the Kutch had a 
small private ceremony to celebrate 
their relationship and found it blown 
up in the media. Even with this, the two 
are positive role models that Americans 
can be proud of, unlike media whores 
Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.
So go ahead, rail on the celebrities 
that put themselves in the spotlight 
and force their ways into our everyday 
lives. Just dont hate the Kutch. Hes 
doing his best to keep it low-key.

Ali Abunimah responds
I am one of the three controversial 
speakers named in the article Com
mittee to review at-issue speakers 
[The Tartan, 9/26]. All across this 
country there is an effort by pro-Is
rael organizations to shut down any 
discussion or debate about the Palestine-Israel conflict and particularly any 
discussion that highlights Israels gross 
and well-documented abuses of human 
rights and violations of international 
law.
The Tartan reported, DePaul 
University professor Norman 
Finkelstein and Palestinian-cause 
speaker Ali Abunimah rounded out the 
list of three speakers whose lectures 
allegedly included anti-Semitic 
material. The article does not say 
who made this allegation, nor what 
the content of my speech was that 
could be in any way construed as antiSemitic.
As your readers will be aware, there 
is little more damaging in our society 
than to be tarred with the accusation of 
anti-Semitism. Those who wish to lay 
such charges should have the courage 
of their convictions to do so openly.
Aaron Weil, the Director of the 
Edward and Rose Berman Hillel Jewish 
University Center, is quoted saying the 
speakers brought messages of hate 
and The position of our students has 
been, and remains to be, that while the 
Constitution guarantees the right of 
free speech, it does not guarantee right 
of venue, and thats why we believe 
those speakers were inappropriate.
Anyone who attended my speech 
will know that I delivered a mes
sage of peace. This ought to be no 
surprise because, although I am a critic 
of Israels policies, I believe fervently 
in full peace, mutual recognition and 
equality between Israelis and Palestin
ians, and have been advocating this 
for many years and have a long public 
record of doing so.
Regretfully, while on the CMU 
campus, I was subjected to abuse and 
harassment including being called a 
cockroach by one student who was 
carrying a pro-Israel sign outside the 
lecture hall. Some students attempted 
to disrupt my lecture and prevent 
others from hearing what I had to say, 
and when I invited those students to 
come down to the podium to express 
whatever dissent they wished, they 
staged a group walk-out. I wonder if 
these are the same students who are 
now claiming that I somehow violated 
their rights by speaking at CMU!
I did not consider their atro
cious behaviour to be in any way 
representative of CMU, because the 
vast majority of the hundreds of stu
dents who attended my lecture at 
[Carnegie Mellon] and another one the 
same day at the University of Pittsburgh
(some of whom were overflow from 
CMU because the hall was filled to ca
pacity) listened respectfully, accorded 
me the warmest and most gracious 
welcome, and engaged with me in a 
free and unrestricted debate in which 
they challenged me and held me to 
acount. I have to admit that this open, 
transparent engagement with students 
is the part of public speaking which I 
enjoy the most.
In February, shortly after my visit 
to CMU, Mr. Weil was quoted in the 
Pitt News making statements that I 
believed to be false and defamatory, 
and as a result, I felt compelled to 
contact my attorney. Mr. Weil actually 
claimed that I had advocated the use 
of terrorism. Mr. Weil acknowledged 
that this was untrue and retracted his 
comments in a phone conversation with 
my attorney. The Pitt News removed 
Mr. Weils comments from their web
site at that time and printed a letter 
from me. (Please see www.pittnews. 
com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/ 
09/4209b299955ebp.)
I do find it incomprehensible that 
Mr. Weil should still be advocating that 
I and other speakers should have been 
banned from the CMU campus. On 
what grounds? I have written to the 
Committee charged by President Cohon 
with the task of reviewing University 
policy on controversial speakers, to 
offer my full cooperation.
I would be pleased to travel to Pitts
burgh to meet the committee so that 
they and the University community 
can decide whether or not this censor
ship campaign is truly responding to a 
genuine concern that my speaking at 
CMU somehow curtailed anyone elses 
freedom, promoted hate or antiSemitism in any way whatsoever, or 
whether, as I suspect this is simply a 
campaign to make it harder for those 
who disagree with Israeli policies to air 
their views on the [Carnegie Mellon] 
campus.

Editorial Note: Typically, Letter to the 
Editor submissions are to be no longer 
than 350 words in length. Although Mr. 
Abuminahs letter is over the 350-word 
limit, we feel it is necessary to publish it 
in full, as he was a guest of the University 
and was named specifically in a number 
of pieces run in The Tartan since the time 
of his lecture.
The Tartan would like to make it clear 
that Mr. Abunimahs views and opinions 
do not represent those of The Tartan. 
Mr. Abunimahs letter was submitted of 
his own volition, and we welcome his 
comments and criticism. Any questions 
or comments ion letters or articles are

Heckling is hateful
A tactic on a number of campuses 
in the United States where Israel is 
the subject of critical debate is to 
infiltrate classes and meetings, create a 
disturbance, then cite these disturbances 
as evidence of the inflammatory nature 
of the events. Together with Daniel 
Pipes Campus Watch, in which students 
are encouraged to report on the con
tent of their teachers classes, the clear 
intention is to limit the freedom of aca
demic discourse.
Responding to the appointment 
of a committee to review CMUs 
controversial speaker policy, Aaron 
Weil, according to The Tartan Online 
(September 25, 2005), citing last 
semesters events on campus, charged, 
The speakers brought messages of 
hate. No one who attended the talks 
given by Ali Abunimah and Norman
Finkelstein could consider that charge 
honorably sustained, nor that their 
talks included anti-Semitic material. 
The only messages of hate were those 
delivered by the organized hecklers at 
both meetings whose purpose was to 
prevent debate rather than engage in 
civilized discussion.
The charge of anti-Semitism, 
increasingly trotted out in lieu of 
argument to defame any criticism of 
Israel, also is a form of hate speech 
that can prove damaging to its victim. 
Such an indiscriminate employment of 
the term is in danger of discrediting its 
legitimate use.

Joint effort 
required 
for change

___________________Tom Sabram
As I sat in on the Undergraduate 
Student Senates Executive 
Committee meeting, I began to 
think about the major problems 
that face any representative gov
ernment. And rather than do my 
usual weekly update, I felt it was 
important to share my thoughts 
with you, the student body: The 
biggest problem the Senate and I 
confront is the lack of input from 
the community we serve. While 
we understand that some of the 
responsibility falls on our shoul
ders, we need feedback from the 
campus community about the 
steps we take so we, the Senate, 
can most adequately serve you.
There is no denying that our 
university is far from perfect. And 
people around campus voice this 
loud and often; however, com
plaining is the least productive 
means of action. If any represen
tative government is forced to 
learn of, and deal with, problems 
in an indirect fashion, necessary 
time to address a given problem 
is lost in the search and discover 
process. The changes we want to 
see on campus simply cannot get 
done in a timely manner if we do 
not know what the students want 
these changes to be.
Nicolette and I are only two 
people, and therefore we always 
need students to help us propel 
forward our initiatives. Of the 
students who approach us about 
sitting on committees, we aim 
to create a diverse group, reflec
tive of myriad opinions, ensur
ing that all ideas and options are 
examined when problem-solving. 
We always want the thoughts of 
people other than members of 
the Student Senate or Graduate 
Student Assembly.
As your President and VicePresident, we encourage you to 
be in contact with us. We are here 
to serve you, and can only do 
our best when we know what is 
most important to you. Nicolette 
has written that a dilemma is 
defined as a situation which only 
has bad problems. A problem is 
a situation which has solutions, 
some good and some bad. The 
sign of a true leader is the ability 
to turn dilemmas into problems. 
But no leader can be effective 
without meaningful input. We 
cannot have your input without 
communication.
Problems that go unaddressed 
can grow out of hand. This is our 
university and our responsibility to 
make it what we want it to be. The 
student government is the best 
avenue to bring about change, so 
use it to your advantage. Enhance 
your college experience by being 
proactive in creating a positive 
environment.
Tom (sbp@J strongly encourages 
you to be in touch. He cannot do 
his job alone and needs the help and 
input of the student body to make 
the positive difference the campus 
community wants and deserves.
In some areas, public schools must teach intelligent design in addition to evolution. In light of this controversy, we asked: A PERSONS OPINION
Do you believe that creationism should be taught alongside evolutionary theory? Compiled by Deren Guler and Veronique Lee

Microsoft starting to take an Apple approach to design
Apple has become a household 
name and is making the best 
of its iPod halo by converting 
more and more users to Macs
 an initiative it is leveraging 
due to increased customer dissat
isfaction with poor, hobbled-byviruses-and-spyware Windows 
machines.
The tides are slowly chang
ing, though. While there seems 
to be no end in sight for Apples 
hipster-powered rise into popculture awareness, Microsoft is 
slowly stirring. The Redmond 
behemoth has gained a reputa
tion for being a big, evil busi
ness, after numorous anti-trust 
cases, security nightmares, and 
stability problems with poorlymaintained Windows installa
tions. Somewhere around 95 
percent of the computer-using 
world uses Windows for everyday 
computing. Internet Explorer 
sucks compared to the ultimate 
underdog, Mozilla Firefox. And 
Microsoft would strongly prefer 
you use Windows Media Player, 
Internet Explorer, Microsoft 
Office, and a plethora of other 
products in one big happy soft
ware bloatfest.
Steve Jobs and the rest of 
Apple have been relentlessly 
teasing Gates and company for
years, thanks to the feature gap 
between Apples Mac OS X and 
Windows XP. Apple has released 
a new version of OS X every year 
or so, and each revision brings 
big new features  and they 
really began attracting atten
tion with 10.3 (Panther), a fully 
matured and very original oper
ating system. Their most recent 
release, 10.4 (Tiger), garnered 
a good deal of attention, too, in 
part thanks to Microsofts longdelayed next-generation Win
dows platform  Windows Vista 
(nee Longhorn).
Microsoft seems to be peren
nially playing catch-up with Ap
ple; however, the gap is rapidly 
narrowing. Microsoft is doing 
what they do best: taking ideas 
and improving on them relent
lessly. Vista will use many of 
the same design paradigms as 
OS X, including a graphically in
tensive user interface (offloaded 
to the video card, of course), a 
robust command line interface, 
a more advanced and flexible 
file system, and search features 
rivaling Apples new Spotlight 
technology.

Ummmmm, no. Separation between

Marshall Roy
Intelligent design is the 
most ridiculous case of rightwing semantic jazz-hands since 
homophobia and misogyny were 
designated family values.
Last week, Kitzmiller v. 
Dover Area School District got 
under way. The lawsuit, in which 
eleven parents in Dover, Pa., are 
opposing their school boards 
mandate that all ninth-grade 
biology students be taught intel
ligent design, is monumental in 
implication, will probably draw 
media attention from around 
the world, and will in all likeli
hood find its way to the freshly 
reorganized Supreme Court.
In case youre unfamiliar: 
Intelligent design is the theory 
that organisms, particularly 
humans, are just too damn 
majestic and complex to have 
evolved through nature, that 
clearly we must have been created 
by* a higher power; obviously we 
were intelligently designed. If 
it sounds a lot like creationism, 
thats because it is.
Honesdy, I thought we were 
beyond this. I thought this debate 
had gone the way of William 
Jennings Bryan and polio. Guess 
I was wrong.
Intelligent design sets a baffling 
precedent. What else could we 
narrow-mindedly deem too com
plex not to be attributed to God? 
Calculus in three dimensions? 
The Sound and the Fury? Leaping 
to supernatural explanations just 
because a topic is too difficult to 
understand is a disgrace to the 
scientific method and, indeed, to 
the entire concept of education. 
Isnt the reason that education 
exists as an institution in the first 
place the fact that most of the 
time things are fundamentally 
not as they seem? Didnt we learn 
long ago that our pre-scientific
mythologies are utterly insuffi
cient to describe or define the 
realities of our world?
Make no mistake: There is not 
a single shred of reputable sci
entific evidence for intelligent 
design. It has been denounced by 
the American Association for the 
Advancement of Sciences and the 
National Academy of Sciences. 
It is shunned en masse by the 
scientific and academic commu
nity. Separation of church and 
state aside, how can we possibly 
permit a baseless theory into a 
science curriculum? We might 
as well throw prayer in with 
physical education.
Furthermore, this issue points 
to the bloated self-importance 
of the religious right in general. 
How dare it demand that public 
schools do its bidding? Parents 
have every prerogative to sit their 
children down and say, What 
you learned in science class is 
wrong. God created the Earth 
and everything in it, period. 
Why does the religious right need 
to have its own values dictated 
back to it? For a demographic 
so pig-headedly convinced of its 
own indisputable correctness, it 
seems pretty insecure. Where is 
its faith when it comes to send
ing its children off to school? 
Maybe it ought to take a good, 
long look at the quality of its con
victions before it tries to draw up 
a curriculum of Biblical biology.
One of the more painfully 
ironic aspects of this case is that 
many members of the religious 
right are claiming that this is 
a freedom of information issue. 
Freedom of information? Arent 
these the same people who 
want Harry Potter banned from 
the school library, and who tell 
their children that masturbation 
causes blindness? Also, I hardly 
think anyones free access to 
information is infringed upon by 
keeping God out of public schools. 
To my knowledge, a Biblical 
education is free and zealously
provided at any of the innumer
able places of worship in this 
country, whereas an academic 
education (as Im sure everyone 
at CMU is acutely aware) is a bit 
more difficult  and expensive
 to obtain. I would venture a 
guess that in this country there 
are far more Bibles than biolo
gists, which makes me question 
the religious rights never-ending 
delusions of persecution. Maybe 
its reactionary, as it begins to 
sense its own uselessness.
Evan Sundwick
The world is dichotomous. You 
have good and evil, light and 
dark, rich and poor, vanilla and 
chocolate, French and American, 
Christian and Muslim, sausage
and bacon, MIT and CMU. How
ever, one of the most high-profile 
of these comparisons has been 
getting more and more interest
ing in recent years: Apple and 
Microsoft.
Since Steve Jobs regained the 
helm of Apple Computer in 1997, 
the company has been at the 
forefront of whats cool in technology. The recent iPod explo
sion has, of course, amplified this 
trend. Apples retail stores, open 
in au courant malls and shopping 
districts worldwide, are draw
ing in thousands of customers a 
day. A number of respected pub
lications, including The New York 
Times, referred to the brand new, 
ultra-small iPod nano as sexy.
As one of the greatest scientific 
institutions in the world, I call on 
the Carnegie Mellon community 
to rally in support of this lawsuit 
and its goal of keeping science 
in school and God in church. 
To our knowledge, the human 
brain is the only apparatus in 
existence that can study itself 
and its origins. Let us never allow 
replacing logical inquiry and 
rational thought with mythology 
to disgrace or betray that 
incredible distinction. We must
unequivocally reject intelligent 
design as a pseudonym for the 
Book of Genesis. We must be 
vigilant in protecting our public 
institutions from those who 
would twist them into tools of 
proselytization.

Who do you make fun of the 
day Windows just works?
WINDOWS, from All
operating system media features 
that will be standard with the 
operating system, giving it 
capabilities right out of the box 
that Mac users would have to 
download third-party programs 
and use third-party hardware 
to accomplish. Whats this? 
Microsofts letting its users do 
something out of the box that 
Apple doesnt? Preposterous.
Integration has always been 
one of Apples strong points. 
Since the company handles ev
ery level of'its computers, from 
design, to manufacture, all the 
way up through the software you 
use to interact with them, its 
easy for them to create machihes 
that just work without much 
fuss. The Windows world has 
been almost the polar opposite, 
becoming a cauldron of drivers, 
bloated software, background 
processes run amok, and gar
gantuan system trays.
However, Microsoft is slowly 
learning the power of integra
tion. Their Exchange Server sys
tem allows a whole network of 
computers to interact with the 
same mail and files everywhere, 
allowing roaming profiles for 
corporate employees. Windows
Media Center  essentially a 
PC hooked up to your television
 has all the important features 
youd need built right in to the 
operating system.
Microsoft is going after the 
heart of what makes Apple, 
Apple  eccentric corporate 
figures and a killer cool factor. 
The Xbox 360, Microsofts nextgeneration game console, was 
announced in May to large 
fanfare on MTV. James Allard, 
the head of the Xbox 360 proj
ect who refers to himself as J, 
is the same sort of over-the-top 
theatrically nerd-chic salesman 
that Jobs is. Immediately, it was 
clear that Microsoft was going 
for the trendy market presence 
that Apple had nailed so easily 
with the iPod. Microsoft even got 
the color right  the console is a 
soothing off-white hue.
Microsoft is pulling out all 
the stops for their Xbox 360 
initiative. Rumor has it that 
theyre opening retail shops to 
house the 360, its games, and 
peripherals, including one 
in the extremely high-profile 
Times Square in New York 
City. More than that, though, 
is an integrated hardware and 
software approach to the device. 
It just works has long been
Apples slogan; now Microsoft 
is taking it seriously too. Heres 
hoping itll pay off, and Micro
soft will let this new philosophy 
trickle down into other areas of 
its business.
Sure, Windows is still full 
of security holes, and Internet 
Explorer is a pile of stagnant 
features. But really, theyre not 
doing too badly. Windows XP is 
far more stable than people give 
it credit for, and Vista looks to be 
full of very promising and very 
modern technology. The Xbox 
program has rocketed to suc
cess in four years and the next' 
generation is poised to make a 
serious splash.
So, enough with all the 
Microsoft hating. Yeah, its cool 
to laugh at one of the worlds 
largest corporations, and theyve 
had some ups and downs in 
the past; but they learn from 
their mistakes better than most 
companies. And thats finally 
starting to show.

hat?Alumnus reflects on Senate race
Amesh Adalja, M.D.
As a fiscally conservative, 
socially liberal Republican, I 
have found myself, as of late, to 
be part of a dying breed. With 
the re-election of President 
George W. Bush being viewed 
by many as an affirmation of 
the Republican Partys efforts 
to meld together Christian reli
gious ideals with government, 
moderate Republicans have been 
driven to examine their role in 
the party. There is only so much 
politicians like Sens. Olympia 
Snowe, Susan Collins, Lincoln 
Chaffee and Arlen Specter, as 
well as Rep. Charlie Dent, can 
do.
In ordinary circumstances, 
disenchanted Republicans might 
turn to the Democratic Party, 
once a bastion for secular values. 
But today that might be an 
equally unappealing option. As if 
the Republican Partys embrace 
of the Religious Right were not 
enough, the Democratic Party 
has followed suit. The Senate 
minority leader, Harry Reid, is 
anti-choice, and no Democratic 
senator stood to oppose 
interference in the Terri Schiavo 
matter.
The power of the Religious 
Right voting bloc has become 
too much for the Democrats to 
ignore any longer. Nowhere is 
this more apparent than in the 
2006 race for a Pennsylvania 
U.S. Senate seat. The current 
occupant, Sen. Rick Santorum, 
is probably the foremost advo
cate of the incorporation of reli
gious values into politics. He has
steadfastly opposed a womans 
right to choose and embryonic 
stem cell research funding, and 
supported the prolonging of 
Terri Schiavos sub-human life. 
Santorum is the perfect foot sol
dier of the Religious Rights cru
sade to divest this nation of its 
secular roots.
The Democratic Party plans 
to counter Santorum with state 
Treasurer Robert P. Casey Jr. 
Ordinarily, one would assume 
that Santorums conservative
step that will bring this nation 
further from its secular moor
ings and must be averted.
Casey is identical to Santorum 
on every social issue, the very 
issues that motivate the major
ity of the vitriol directed at 
Santorum. It defies logic that 
Democrats would rally around 
Casey, unless, regarding their 
core principles as superfluous, 
the quest for power has become 
primary.
There is one alternative canSantorum has steadfastly supported 
the prolonging of Terri Schiavos 
sub-human life.
stances on social issues  being 
the object of derision and hatred 
that they are  would dictate 
that the Democrats nominate a 
diametric opposite of Santorum.
With this election, this is 
not the case. At least two prochoice candidates, in this prochoice state, have been brushed 
aside by party leaders in favor of 
Casey, a staunchly anti-choice, 
anti-stem-cell-research, socially 
conservative candidate. He has 
all but been anointed.
Democrats have rallied behind 
Casey in large numbers, discard
ing their socially liberal cre
dentials, motivated solely by a 
desire to unseat Santorum. They 
believe that Casey in the Senate 
represents a step in the right 
direction. I maintain that it is a
didate who I believe holds hope 
for the Democratic Party. He has 
been largely ignored by th pow
ers that be, but yet he labors 
on with a growing presence. His 
name is Chuck Pennacchio and 
he, in my secular Republican 
opinion, is the best candidate for 
the Senate. Pennacchio is prochoice, pro-stem-cell and not a 
puppet of the Religious Right.
In the quest for control of this 
nation, the Religious Right has 
steered us in a direction that 
the Founding Fathers would 
never fathom. If we are to return 
this nation to the correct path, 
it is people like Pennachio who 
deserve to be at the helm.

Communist rule in China 
turned 56 this October 1. There 
was a flag-raising ceremony in 
the early morning and celebra
tions in a few places throughout 
the mainland. Thousands turned 
out at Tiananmen Square to cel
ebrate the anniversary. Com
munist Chinas anniversary, like 
Castros birthday, is a happy day 
for the socialist community at 
Carnegie Mellon. China has be
come a major global power.
But what has really driven its 
success?
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao tells us that History has 
shown that China has chosen 
the right path. China  simi
larly to Japan, India, and Brazil
 is able to extract efforts from 
its population very efficiently. 
Even so, much of the develop
ment in modern China is owed 
to foreign investment and specu
lation. Foreign investment is a, 
necessary component of high 
growth rates. The influx of 
capital into the Chinese regime 
has enabled Beijing to use its 
communist controls to finance 
major economic development 
projects.
But state-owned banking sys
tems cannot forever sustain a 
booming national growth rate 
and global economic power.
The optimistic philosophies 
of the United States and large 
democratic blocs such as the 
European Union have also fur
thered Chinese expansion. Al
lowing China into the WTO is a 
prime example of a policy that 
hopes for symbiotic development 
between nations. At the time, 
the theory stated that this in
corporation would open a large 
population to products from the 
United States and other coun
tries. While certainly exported 
American culture has trickled in, 
the strong Chinese controls on 
media and access have kept their 
population firmly under their 
thumb.
Having China become 
a global player has a basis in 
security as well. There are farreaching similarities between

the beginnings of the Cold War 
and the current period of parity 
between China and the United 
States. Just as in the Cold War, 
in a war with China there is no 
possibility of total destruction of 
the enemy alone. Nuclear parity, 
the impossibility of a full-scale 
land invasion and occupation 
of China, and population issues 
make the prospects of total de
feat slim.
With Russia during the Cold 
War, the United States main 
strategy was military deterrence 
and MAD (Mutual Assured De
struction) through nuclear sec
ond strike capability and strategic 
troop locations across the globe. 
There are elements of these pres
ent in our relations with China
tically in the Taiwan region. 
Concurrently, the U.S. can en
gage them in economic trade 
and through diplomatic means. 
Overall, if the Chinese can be 
brought into the current status 
quo system, with its current in
ternational norms, some theo
rists argue that the likelihood of 
war decreases.
The widening gap between 
rich and poor in China and its 
human rights abuses are still a 
leprous mark on the red Chinese 
epidermis. The United States 
and the international commu
nity cannot ignore these issues 
in the simple hope of taming 
the Chinese dragon through 
economic development and re
wards.
In fact, the best policy with 
China is to engage them in a 
Lukewarm War.
through NATO and our policy 
of defending Taiwan. No one on 
the Chinese side would argue 
that the current Chinese military 
is a match for the United States 
military prowess.
A military solution is not 
the most beneficial method to 
solving the China problem. In 
fact, the best policy with China is 
to engage them in a Lukewarm 
War. Part military effort and 
part economic and cultural 
interlacing, this sort of War 
will project U.S. power and in
fluence, bringing the Chinese in 
line with international norms. 
On the military side, the strate
gic military holds in Taiwan and 
Japan and the continued build
ing of Indias arsenal are neces
sary steps. India will be the re
gional force keeping the Chinese 
in check in their pursuit of power 
and resources.
The other tactic that is 
necessary is fully integrating 
China into the world economy. 
This is a strategy that was not 
used in the bipolar setup of the 
Cold War.
On one side, the United States 
could be engaging China tac
The United States current 
policy of deterrence through 
integration is a winning one. 
While the U.S. engages a 
potential enemy in trade, mak
ing them economically interde
pendent, it also maintains its 
power visibility on the interna
tional level. Methods of quell
ing potential challengers have 
changed since the conclusion 
of the Cold War. Nuclear weap
ons proliferation and increased 
informational availability have 
led to a need for careful asset 
positioning. This effort is now 
coupled with societal integration 
through trade and cultural diffu
sion. This setup enables preser
vation of the international norms 
consistent with the current status 
quo of democracy and human 
rights. These methods are a win
ning strategy for a peaceful 21st 
century  a century in which 
great powers do not engage in

tough Allegheny College defense 
Tuesday night. The Tartans 
were unable to find the back of 
the net despite putting 13 shots 
on goal throughout 110 minutes 
of play. In contrast, Tartan 
keeper Mary Ashe didnt have to 
make one save the whole night, 
as Allegheny was only able to get 
off two shots that sailed wide of 
the net.
Carnegie Mellons driving 
offense kept the ball in the 
Allegheny side of the field for 
most of the night. However, 
when the defense was tested,
they rarely gave in, allowing just 
two corner kicks for the whole 
game. Led by Salpeter, the teams 
back line allowed nothing to get 
behind them, giving Ashe an 
easy night guarding the net.
On the opposite site, Allegheny 
keeper Beth Van Parys was busy 
all night, making ten saves in 
regulation and three more in the 
two overtimes. Carnegie Mellon 
had a balanced offensive attack, 
with Hallie Dumont, Jessica 
Howard, and Kristin Bevilacqua 
each putting two shots on net.
The common theme during 
the season for the Tartans has 
been the strong play of firstyear goalies Ashe and Adams, 
who have allowed only one goal 
in nine games on the season. 
Backed by a strong defensive 
line, their play has been an Xfactor for the team and should 
bump them up the UAA rankings 
list. This is combined with the 
offensive presence of first-year 
Coffin, who has seven of the 
teams 27 total goals and has 
added an extra dimension to the 
team. Their victory Sunday may 
lead to a national ranking.
The team will return to action 
Sunday, October 9, to face 
Washington University in Saint 
Louis.
Tartan cross country teams rebuild 
on the run at Dickinson Invitational
by Andrew Clearfield
Assistant Sports Editor
This Saturdays cross-country 
meet at Dickinson College was 
not the marquee race of the 
fall season; that would be the 
UAA conference championships 
October 28 at CMU. Nonetheless, 
the CMU mens second-place 
overall finish bodes well for a team 
looking to replace several runners 
from the group that qualified 
for last years NCAA Division III 
national championships.
The Tartans were led by senior 
All-American Dana Irrers secondplace finish in the 4K race. He was 
followed by fellow captain Nick 
End, who finished fourth and 
Mike Bridenbaugh who placed 
22nd in the race.The combination 
of these three was enough to give 
the team the second-best team in 
the invitationals first event.
In the meets 8K race, firstyear Breck Fresen was CMUs top
finisher; he finished 17th with a 
time of 27:16.29.
Irrer called the race an 
important tune-up for the bigger 
events to come later this fall. 
Everyone was a little off I think, 
but we got a competitive race in 
against some good teams, which 
we needed.
The meet was unusual for a 
set-up that divided the racers 
into two fields, the 8K and the 
4K, the latter a race rarely run 
in competition. In contrast, most 
collegiate races are longer than 
the standard high school 5K. The 
Tartans sent their veteran runners 
into the 4K race since they were 
familiar with the course from past 
years at the invitational.
Still, the rapid pace and the 
crowded running lanes provided 
a challenging combination for 
CMU runners used to the slower, 
more open setup of the 8K. As 
Irrer put it, We were all just 
surprised how fast it was. We 
hoped to hang back, but it was so
busy it was hard to get through 
once we fell behind. But, if I got 
the kick I should have at the end I 
think I couldve come out [first].
On the womens side, senior 
Jocelyn Sikora led the team 
with a time of 23:29.44 that 
gave her 11th place in the 6K. 
K.J. Helmsetter and Carrie 
Mallozzi followed her in 23rd and 
49th place, respectively. Overall, 
the women finished sixth in the 
6K, the only event in which they 
had enough runners to qualify.
For the men, the focus now 
turns to preparation for the 
Carnegie Mellon Invitational 
on October 9 and then the UAA 
championships later in the month 
 races the team will now enter 
with satisfactory experience.
As sophomore Doug Fricker 
says, I think now we are ready 
to move on and look at the bigger 
meets. This [weekends race] was 
great to get us back into the grind; 
now we have to look towards 
regionals.

one-timed a shot off a cross 
by Andrew Park, but everyone 
was devastated when the shot 
went wide right, just past the 
fingertips of the goalie, and the 
outside of the goalpost. The 
second half of overtime started 
far more intensely, with a fast 
break by Filipovitz that caught 
the Lions defense off guard.
Later on, Tartan senior defender 
and captain Dan Mastalski had a 
beautiful free kick that could have 
won it for the Tartans. However, 
both Filipovitzs breakaway 
and Mastalskis free kick were 
saved by the Lion goalkeeper.
Afterwards, the second half of 
overtime had an excruciating 
number of close calls, but proved 
to be fruitless, as the game came 
to a scoreless close.
It >is much tougher to be 
mentally psyched for mid-week 
games for obvious reasons, 
stated junior forward Andrew 
Park.
This game felt much less 
intense than it should have been 
considering Altoona was the 
only team to beat us last year in 
the regular season. However, we 
dominated play; we just could 
not put the ball away.
There is no reason to dwell 
on this game, Park continued.
This Sunday is our conference 
opener and is very important for 
us. We need to start thinking 
about that one.
Despite the preparation, the 
team was unable to rebound 
against the University of Chicago 
Sunday. Despite only allowing 
two shots on goal, the Tartans 
fell 0-1 to lose their first game of 
the season.
Chicago goalie Keith Crum 
made five saves to shut out the 
Tartans, who dropped to 5-1-1 
on the season.
Carnegie Mellon looks to 
rebound this Wednesday night at 
Gesling at 7:30 pm against Point 
Park University.

Football trounces Colorado 63-28
by Kevin LaBuz
Staffwriter
After managing to score only 
six points in each of their last two 
contests, the Carnegie Mellon 
Tartans (3-2) overcame their 
offensive struggles Saturday 
when they traveled to Colorado 
Springs to play the Colorado 
College Tigers (1-3).
The Tartans, who have been 
stagnant offensively the last two 
weeks, gained over 170 yards 
on the ground and scored three 
rushing touchdowns  and 
that was just in the first twenty 
minutes of the game.
The Tartans set the tempo of 
the games play when sophomore, 
fullback Travis Sivek scored a 
touchdown on a 29-yard run 
early in the first quarter. From 
that moment onward, the 
Tartans dominated the game on 
both sides of the ball. Ultimately 
the Tartans won the game 63-28 
behind a very solid offensive 
performance.
In the first quarter, the 
Tartans rushed for 167 yards 
and two touchdowns, both by 
Sivek. Defensively, the Tartans 
prevented the Tigers from 
scoring and forced one turnover, 
an interception by junior safety 
Aaron Lewis.
While the Tigers special teams 
scored early in the second quarter 
when first-year halfback Justin 
Alexander returned a kickoff 
for a 94-yard touchdown, their 
offense was kept silent until the
end of the second quarter. Late 
in the second quarter, Tigers 
sophomore quarterback Scott 
Green connected with senior 
wide receiver Jake Craig for a 
two-yard touchdown pass. It was 
the first time this season that 
the Tartan defense has allowed a 
touchdown reception.
The Tartans meanwhile added 
three touchdowns in the second 
quarter, with Sivek as well as 
sophomore halfbacks Robert 
Gimson and Colby Whitman 
finding the end zone. At halftime, 
the Tigers trailed the Tartans 
35-14.
Over the past two weeks, it 
has been the defense that has 
kept the Tartans in the game. 
This week, however, it was the 
offense flourished, breaking 
out of its two-week dormancy. 
With a bevy of opportunities as 
a result of Tiger turnovers, the 
Tartan offense sprung into high 
gear Saturday, running all over 
the shoddy Colorado defense.
The Tigers, over their first 
three games, have given up an 
average of 292 yards per game. 
This week, the Tartans gained 
547 yards against them and 
scored 63 points. Strong 
blocking by the offensive line 
and a relatively undersized 
Tiger defense resulted in nearly 
500 yards rushing for the 
Tartans, with the average run 
going for more than five yards. 
Sivek led the offense with a 
career-high 156 yards and four 
touchdowns. Gimson also had 
a career day, running for over
100 yards and two touchdowns. 
Whitman, senior halfback 
Joseph Hurley, and junior 
quarterback Kevin Mulkern all 
scored touchdowns.
While the offense relied 
primarily on the rush, the 
passing game, under senior 
quarterback Jarrod Highberger, 
was also effective when used. 
Additionally, junior kicker 
Nathaniel Greenstein ended the 
game with nine extra points.
The Tartan defense was not as 
dominant as it has been over the 
past two weeks, but because they 
were protecting a large lead for 
the bulk of the game their play 
was more then adequate. While 
the Tigers scored 28 points, the 
Tartan defense had a recordbreaking performance, forcing 
seven interceptions. Junior 
defensive back John Menhart 
and junior safety Aaron Lewis 
both had three interceptions and 
junior linebacker James Rodgers 
had one.
This weeks game is sure to 
boost the teams confidence and 
morale after two tough losses. 
While the defense continues to 
play tough, the offense finally 
came out of its shell to find the 
end zone nine times.
The Tartans, who have next 
week off, will see if they can 
carry the momentum from this 
win when they start conference 
play at the University of Chicago 
on October 15. Despite their 
two losses, a strong finish and a 
UAA title could propel the team 
to an NCAA postseason .berth.
Mens soccer finishes week 0-1-1
by Shaleya Solomon
Junior Staffwriter
Wednesdays game against 
the Penn State-Altoona Lions 
couldnt hold a candle to last 
weeks match. The Tartan mens 
soccer team, already considered 
a second-half team, got off to an 
even slower start than usual this 
past Wednesday.
For most of the game, the two 
teams were evenly matched with 
equal possession of the ball. The 
Tartans had many opportunities 
and shots on goal, but they were 
shut down by the impressive skills 
of PSAs keeper, Tim Wassell. 
Tartan first-year keeper Matthew 
Bazin also showcased his skills, 
as the Lions had almost too many 
shots on pnal fnr rnmfnrt
yellow cards were given out  
one to CMU, and two to PSA. By 
the end of the game, fans, players, 
and coaches grew anxious when 
the scoreboard still read a dismal, 
0-0. With that, the teams entered 
into sudden death overtime.

ten-minute bracket, Tartan

BEATS #8 
CHICAGO
by Christian DAndrea
Sports Editor
The womens soccer team only 
managed two shots on goal in 
their division opener Sunday 
versus Chicago. However, two 
was all they would need, as both 
found the back of the Chicago 
net to seal a 2-0 victory on the 
Gesling turf. The victory puts the 
team at 7-0-2 for the season and 
1-0 in their quest for a UniversityAthletic Association title.
The Tartans started the game 
strongly, scoring just nine 
minutes into the game to put the 
visiting Maroons in a hole early. 
Sophomore defender Amanda 
Rose blasted a free kick off the 
left post of the Chicago goal, 
creating a pile-up in front of the 
net. Junior midfielder Lisa Pascoli 
pushed the ball past outstretched
Chicago goalie Andrea Przybysz 
to give the Tartans a 1-0 lead.
The Maroons appeared as if 
they would tie the game in the 
58th minute as a Chicago forward 
took a shot to the left side of the 
net that appeared to be heading 
in until senior defender Mollie 
Salpeter ran in front of it to clear 
the ball out of the Carnegie Mellon 
zone. This would be the one save 
of the day that first-year keeper 
Christie Adams did not make.
The team added another goal 
with just three minutes to play 
when first-year Abigail Coffin, the 
teams leading scorer, headed in 
another free kick from Rose. The 
play gave Rose her second assist 
of the night on a play where she 
crossed the ball in front of the net 
to Coffin, who headed the ball 
past Przybysz.

Womens volleyball 
loses to Washington

The womens volleyball team 
lost their first UAA round-robin 
game on Saturday, falling to the 
Washington University in St. 
Louis Bears in three matches. The 
game, part of the first University 
Athletic Association (UAA) roundrobin tournament, was played at 
Case Western Reserve University, 
and ended the Tartans winning 
streak at nine games. The loss 
came days after outside hitter 
Catie Fisher was named UAA 
Volleyball Athlete of the Week.
In both teams first 2005 UAA 
matchup, the Bears, who were 
also last years divisional 
champions, defeated the Tartans 
30-23, 30-13, 30-21. Partway 
through the first match, the 
Tartans led 12-9, only to 
suffer an 8-1 run by the Bears. 
Washingtons subsequent 17-13 
lead proved insurmountable, as 
Carnegie Mellon lost its closest 
match of the game at 30-23. The 
Bears then exploded out of the 
gates in the second match with six 
straight points, which included 
two aces. The Tartans never 
recovered, and Washington went 
onto 30-13 and 30-21 victories.
The Bears sweep puts topranked Washington at 13-0, 
overall, and pushes Carnegie 
Mellons season record to 12-6. 
The team had not previously 
dropped a game since losing to 
Washington & Jefferson College 
in four games on September 14, 
and had not been swept since 
playing University of WisconsinWhitewater on September 10. The 
loss marks the first of Carnegie 
Mellons seven UAA round-robin 
games.
The Case Western Reserve 
University tournament is one of 
two round-robin weekends, and 
encompasses three of each teams 
seven round-robin games. On 
Sunday, the Tartans faced two 
other teams: New York University 
and University of Chicago. NYU 
swept Brandeis (30-18, 30-23,
30-23) on the first day of the 
tournament, while Chicago was 
swept by Emory (30-12, 30-13, 
30-21).
Against tough competition, 
the team came away with a split, 
defeating Chicago 3-1 after being 
swept by UAA title-favorites New 
York 3-0. Despite the unforunate 
(1-2) outcome, the Tartans will 
look to rebound next week to 
better their UAA standing.
The second round-robin 
tournament is scheduled for 
next weekend at Washington 
University. There, each teams 
remaining four UAA games will 
be played. The results of the 
two round-robin tournaments 
determine the seeding for the 
UAA championships, which take 
place November 5-6 at Brandeis 
University. Last year, the Tartans 
placed fourth in the eight-team 
bracket.
In order to rebound from their 
loss to the Bears, the Tartans will 
need to pick their game up to a 
new level, as Catie Fisher did on 
September 23 and 24. Fisher, a 
junior, was acknowleged as the 
UAAs Volleyball Athlete of the 
Week following CMUs only home 
tournament of the season. The 
outside hitter has totaled 79 kills 
and 83 digs between CMUs game 
against Marietta College and the 
2005 Carnegie Crossover.
In last weeks five games, 
Fisher boasted 11, 24, 22,16, and 
eight kills, respectively. She will 
be counting on the continued 
excellent play of junior outside 
hitter Brea Carlock, who led the 
UAA in assists last year. The two 
combine with All-UAA performers 
in senior Chrissy Bartek and 
sophomore Amanda Bradford to 
give the team a formidable lineup 
in their division.
Fisher and the Tartans 
will try to improve their UAA 
seeding October 15 and 16 
when Washington University 
hosts the second and final UAA 
round-robin tournament. After a 
week off, the Tartans will battle 
Brandeis, Emory, Case Western, 
and Rochester.

CMU Philharmonic season starts
A look at their upcoming performances
Juan Pablo Izquierdo, conductor of the Carnegie 
Mellon Philharmonic, successfully launched the 
season last Wednesday with a colorful program 
of contrasting impressionistic works: Debussys 
La Mer and La Cathdral Engloutie, fol
lowed by Ravels Alborada and La Valse.
Because of some obvious similarities, the French 
Impressionists Claude 
Debussy and Maurice 
Ravel are frequently 
paired together on 
concert programs. The 
program Wednesday 
night highlighted two 
themes that inspired 
the music of Debussy 
and Ravel throughout 
their lives: the water 
and Spain. The pro
gram also displayed 
the unique musi
cal language of each 
composer: Debussys 
floats on a cush
ion of air, said New 
York Times critic Har
old Schonberg, and 
Ravels more classi
cally refined style ticks away like a well-assembled chronometer.
Since water was a frequent form of inspiration 
for both Debussy and Ravel, it comes as no sur
prise that the opening piece was Debussys La 
Mer, a three-movement symphonic work com
posed in 1905 that beautifully portrays a moody 
sea. La Mer manages to capture the stillness 
of the ocean at daybreak, the playfulness of the 
waves, and the forceful dialogue between the 
wind and the sea.
Following La Mer was another water work: 
Debussys Le Cathdrale Engloutie (The Sub
merged Cathedral). Le Cathdrale Engloutie 
was based on the French legend of the myste
rious sunken cathedral of Ys. This work origi
nated as a piano piece, Debussys tenth move
ment of the first book of Preludes, and it was 
later orchestrated by the dynamic conductor 
Leopold Stokowski.
Moving on from the water pieces, the orchestra 
played several Ravel pieces to open the second
half of the concert. There is a popular saying in 
the classical music world that the best Spanish 
music was composed by Frenchmen. Certainly, 
Ravels fascination with Spanish music was 
probably sparked by his mothers interest in 
Spanish culture. His interpretation of Spanish 
dance, Alborada del Gracioso, was also com
posed as a solo piano work around 1905. But 
Ravel, a master orchestrator, decided to 
orchestrate it himself 
to explore new possi
bilities in tone color.
The concert concluded 
with another of Ravels 
pieces, the bombastic 
La Valse. His inspi
ration for La Valse 
was the light, popular 
Viennese waltz form 
of Johann Strauss, Jr. 
Ravel provides us with 
a vivid description of 
his adaptation of the 
form: I conceived of 
this work as a sort of 
apotheosis of the Vi
ennese waltz, mingled 
with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, 
fatal whirling.... Not your typical fluffy Strauss 
waltz, although the oom pah pah flavor re
mains.
This concert was just the beginning of the sea
son for the CMU Philharmonic. On April 5, the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestras own artistic 
advisor, Andrew Davis, will be leading the or
chestra at Heinz Hall. And in October, the or
chestra will perform two concerts under pupils 
of Juan Pablo Izquierdo. On October 26, Wal
ter Morales will conduct works by the Russian 
Romantic Borodin and a lush, cinematic violin 
concerto by Korngold, performed by violinist 
Emma Hancock.

205 THE ARHNO
50 YEARS AGO 
October 4,1955
The Tartan reported on those lucky gals who became candidates for 
CMUs Homecoming queen. One of the reported candidates had quite 
an interesting name: Ann Pete Boyer. Pete? Um, I didnt even know 
they had that kind of surgery in 1955. And to think, she was nominated 
for Homecoming Queen! imagine what the other girls must have looked 
like.
YEARS AGO 
October 7,1980
Abbie Hoffman began a tour of U.S. colleges, The Tartan announced. 
Hoffman was a wildly radical yippie who organized anti-war rallies 
during Vietnam. He narrowly eluded the government for many years 
and was reported to be accepting money for the college tour to pay for 
his court expenses. Hippies accepting money to pay off their debts, eh? 
This proves yet again that the man always wins and the spirit of free love 
and radical thought is dead.
10 YEARS AGO 
October 2,1995
Students choose marijuana, LSD for social fun, a Tartan headline 
proclaimed. While alcohol may still be the most popular drug on college 
campuses across America, other drugs get their share of attention too. 
Carnegie Mellon is no exception. Does Carnegie Mellon count as a drug 
now? Possible side effects include delusions of grandeur, insomnia, and 
speaking in codes.
5 YEARS AGO 
October 2,2000
Someone was stealing campus food. Wait. they stole campus food? 
The Tartan printed a crime report that stated, He or she [.the thief]... 
removed two packages of turkey, one of ham, two of roast beef, and one 
of beef tenderloin  Where did he take it to, his mini fridge?
1 YEAR AGO
October 4,2004 -
Jeopardy! auditions were held in Rangos, where students could test 
their knowledge of obscure and relatively useless facts. If successful, 
they would win a chance to meet a post-mustache Alex Trebek. Big 
surprise: one of our wonderful students, Kermin Fleming, won the 
College Championship on Jeopardy! Fleming was awarded $100,000, 
which still only pays for two and a half of his years at CMU. That makes 
me cry.

Remedy comes to Rangos
Member of the Wu-Tang Clan discusses his musical inspirations and experiences
Drew Hendrickson/Photo Staff
The Wu-Tang clan has revolutionized hip-hop with their catchy 
songs and well-written lyrics.
I represent real hip-hop, a short, bulky white man said, 
dressed in grey sweats and a Kangol cap. In a music 
industry where image is everything and labels all too 
often define popular artists, Remedy  a white Jewish 
rapper from, Staten Island, New York  stormed Rangos 
Ballroom Saturday night with hopes of breaking down 
stereotypes that plague not only the music business, but 
many aspects of modern society.
Before performing to a half-filled Rangos Ballroom 
Saturday night, Wu-Tang Clan affiliate Remedy and his 
troupe of rappers and producers stopped off at the Hillel 
Jewish University Center to speak with reporters from 
Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh, and 
other organizations in the area.
Remedy, a proud supporter of Judaism, often travels to 
Jewish day camps, Hebrew schools, and college campuses
to promote his message of peace across all religions, 
nationalities, and races. In 2003, he had the opportunity 
to travel to Israel with fellow rapper Killah Priest, with 
whom Remedy shared the bill on Saturday night.
From the beginning, Saturday nights concert was all 
about cross-cultural understanding and acceptance. 
Before a single note was played, Lucas Brenowitz
 Remedys manager  spoke for 10 minutes about 
diversity in Israel. The second language in Israel is 
actually Arabic, followed by Russian, Brenowitz said. 
Its a much more diverse place than people think. In 
fact, Israel was one of the first countries to have a female 
Prime Minister. Brenowitz emphasized the groups desire 
to bring diversity and acceptance, prevalent in Israels 
culture, to America and the rest of the world.
Before Remedy took the stage, Lowngealo, JJ Pellegrino, 
and Killah Priest all performed several songs, each one 
with his own unique style. Lowngealo took the stage with 
an aggressive attack, jumping on stage monitors and 
running through the crowd while shouting, Code Red, 
lock n load! JJ Pellegrino, dressed in blue warm-ups 
and a wifebeater, was more elegant in his performance, 
frequently stopping mid-song, either to fix levels or get 
the audience involved. Killah Priest, dressed in black 
with a hood over his head, slowly strolled on stage with 
a mysterious air that added to the sentimentality of his 
lyrics.
My nationality is humanity, I represent reality, Remedy 
shouted as he stormed the stage. Unlike other famous 
Jewish musicians such as Matisyahu, Remedys outer 
appearance revealed little about his religious affiliation. 
Remedy sported a red Budweiser racing jacket and baggy 
blue jeans. Instead of using diamond rings and material 
things, Remedy relied strictly on his lyrics to deliver his 
message of peace and unity. Keep your ears and eyes 
open, Remedy warned before breaking into Book of 
Life. Promoting outreach and understanding, all four 
rappers chanted, Stop, look, listen, read, think, feel, 
move, breathe!
Remedy then broke into his most famous number, Never 
Again, which was written in response to the atrocities 
committed in the Holocaust. To the men, women, and 
children who died and' struggled to live, never to be 
forgotten... never again, he chanted as he sat on a stool, 
passionately pounding out lyrics about his rich heritage 
that was once tortured, slaved, raped, robbed, and 
persecuted.
The fact that Remedy cites the Beastie Boys and Run DMC 
at Madison Square Garden in New York as his favorite 
concert should not come as a surprise. The Beastie Boys 
is a group of three Caucasian Jews from Brooklyn, while 
Run DMC was made up of three African-American men 
from Queens. The unity of the two bands in the same 
concert was a groundbreaking statement of acceptance.
In his interview at the Hillel JUC, Remedy put a strong 
emphasis on staying away from major record labels. Being 
on a big label is all about the almighty dollar, Remedy 
said. Things with true meaning are now meaningless.... 
Its like selling your soul. Remedys views on the record 
industry go hand in hand with his positive message of 
being true to yourself and those around you: Hip-hop is 
about who and what you are. I put who and what I am 
into my music.
Saturday nights concert ended with students and 
members of the community gathering up on stage to 
sing, dance, rap, and even eat brownies that were made 
for Killah Priests birthday. If the positive vibes and great 
music didnt make the concert a fabulous experience, the 
brownies certainly did.

______________tu rnta ble._
Rolling Stones and Pearl Jam let the good times roll
These two rock heavyweights put on an amazing show
How do you know youre in a great band? Obviously, you 
have to have good music. You have to be able to adapt 
with the times without essentially changing your style. 
You can have impressive individual musicians, but you 
always have to work as a cohesive unit. Stage presence 
doesnt hurt either.
Maybe you just have to be the Rolling Stones.
On Wednesday, thousands of very lucky western 
Pennsylvanians  as well as people from Ohio, Kentucky, 
New Jersey and as far away as Colorado  got to see what 
may very well be the greatest live band in the world. PNC 
Park, which can house 38,365 people during a baseball 
game, was filled to capacity, with thousands more Stones 
fans on the field in front of the massive multi-story stage 
and hundreds more relaxing outside the park on the grass 
or on more than 100 boats anchored in the Allegheny 
River.
After receiving two tickets for my birthday from very 
generous, benevolent parental figures, I was now in 
the midst of it all, eight rows up from the field. Call me 
sheltered, but this was the largest concert I have ever been 
to in my twenty years, and quite an experience it was.
I occupied a tenuous position, both literally and 
figuratively. Although the seats were amazing (and 
expensive  thanks, Dad), I was younger than most of 
the audience members around me. The majority of the
college students were up in the highest cheap seats. 
Furthermore, I was sort of caught in a cross-generational 
dilemma. Was I here, like many of my peers, to see Pearl 
Jam open, or was I going to hang out with the grown-ups 
and cheer for the Stones?
The answer, happily enough, was both. Was there ever 
a band more worthy of opening for the Rolling Stones 
than Pearl Jam? Probably not. Already a great band in 
of themselves, Pearl Jam whipped most of the audience 
members under the age of 50 into a frenzy. As a child 
of the 90s, I was raised on Pearl Jam. I still remember 
the family purchase of Vitalogy as a crucial, profound 
childhood event, and Riot Act occupies a permanent 
place in my cars CD magazine. I was expecting a lot out 
of them.
They delivered. Eddie Vedder looks and sounds exactly 
the same as he did when I was eight, minus the plaid shirt. 
Clutching a bottle of something alcoholic, he frantically 
played the guitar, ran up and down the length of the 
massive stage, vaulted over sound equipment like an 
Olympian, and practically drove the more diehard Pearl 
Jam fans in the audience (some of which I was perilously 
near) to religious head-banging epiphany. Older Stones 
fans kept yelling at them to sit down.
However, by the end of their set, those same crotchety 
fans were singing along as Vedder launched into a cover 
of Neil Youngs Rockin In the Free World. Next to me,
the grungy twentysomething who had been leading his 
section in screaming out the lyrics to Better Man and 
the angry middle-aged man behind him both sat down 
together to share a smoke.
Then, in a burst of fireworks and flames (literally), came 
the Rolling Stones.
Belting out the beginning to Start Me Up, Mick Jagger 
leaped out onto the stage in a gold sequined jacket, 
setting a frantic pace for the next two hours, and the rest 
followed suit. Let it be known: Mick Jagger is not of this 
world. He defies all laws of nature and physics. The man 
is 62 years old, and yet for two hours straight he swished, 
sashayed, slunk, and slithered his way through song after 
song, never missing a beat. How does he do it? We mere 
mortals may never know.
Although Jagger truly is the paramount front man, he 
rarely upstaged his fellow Stones. Charlie Watts breezed 
away on his drums without expending any apparent 
effort, Ronnie Wood danced around with his guitar, and 
Keith Richards was, well, Keith Richards. Good evening, 
Pittsburgh, he croaked to the audience with a deadpan 
face. The place went crazy.
The lineup included old classics like You Cant Always 
Get What You Want, Paint It Black, Its Only Rock 
n Roll, and Sympathy for the Devil, which Jagger 
delivered in a top hat, silhouetted in front of a red screen. 
They also performed songs off their new album A Bigger 
Bang, which to me seemed a little generic.
In fact, the only thing that bothered me about the set was 
its lack of edge. In my opinion, the Stones are best when 
theyre attheir worst, as in the terrifically creepy Midnight 
Rambler, or when theyre singing the praises of misogyny 
in Under My Thumb. No such politically incorrect music 
sullied this evening. It was most definitely a golden-years 
concert for the Stones, which was saddening. I guess I 
arrived a few decades too late.
However, on the walk back to the parking garage, swept 
along in a sea of exalted fans, I overheard the lady next 
to me commenting to her husband, Did you see some of 
those kids in there? I was impressed. They knew all the 
words for Pearl Jam, but they knew all the words for the 
Rolling Stones too.
Maybe thats the real key to being a great band  the 
ability to leap generations in a single bound.

WQED producer and familiar voiceover actor Rick Sebak 
emceed the event, which began with radio personality 
and Annie Lennox lookalike Jan Beatty. Beatty read 
poems by Allen Ginsberg, a poet whose work had her 
thrown off Pittsburgh radio years earlier. Beatty has since 
returned as part of WYEP-FMs Prosody. Jim Ferlo, a 
Pennsylvania state senator who loves libraries, read from 
Walt Whitmans Leaves of Grass.
Current political events underscored the evening of 
classic literature. Tim Stevens, prior to
reading a chapter from Richard Wrights
Native Son, reminded the audience of
racisms pulse still beating in the United States. Hurricane 
Katrina and its failed relief effort have shown us how
far we have come in not coming forward, Stevens said 
to applause. Also earning support from the audience 
was all bashing of President Bushs PATRIOT Act, an 
act that can force librarians to turn over private client 
information to the government. Now really, what were 
you doing with that encyclopedia on pre-imperialist 
China? Planning to mimic their tactics, no doubt!
Bruce Boni, vice-president of programs and public 
education for the ACLLPs Pittsburgh chapter, recognized 
theironicallyOrwellianaspectsofthecurrentgovemment. 
Reading an article of the PATRIOT Act, Boni reminded 
the audience that he had not just read an excerpt from 
Orwells 1984. (If youre among the 500-odd students 
who havent read that one, in it, Orwell depicts a society
in which all citizens are spied on by an all-seeing Big 
Brother. (Yes, like the TV show.)
All of the speakers advocated the importance of resisting 
movements that try to censor art because it may be 
unorthodox or dissenting. The Banned Books Reading 
underscored that as long as there are readers, there will 
be censorship. And as long as there is censorship, there 
will be people to say no. At the very least, the true 
freedom fighters are not going away.

Double-majoring dilemma
How overworked CMU students are meeting their needs
At Carnegie Mellon, double-majoring has gained a 
new meaning. Its become the new norm where even a 
minor was once considered overloading. Traditionally, 
students who double-majored were perceived as 
overachievers  the ambitious leaders of the future who 
would become the next big CEO.
However, an inherent aspect of the Carnegie Mellon 
culture is overachievement. In fact, not over-exerting 
yourself in academics, or extracurricular activities, 
or a combination of both, makes you different  an 
outlier. Nowadays, its not unusual for a CMU student 
to be a voice major with a civil engineering degree 
as well. While only having one major may be the 
norm at other universities across the nation, here its 
perceived as unusual, different, and even lazy So 
CMU has answered the demand with several custom 
interdisciplinary programs that try to fill in the gaps.
Many students, upon arriving to campus, are initially 
shocked by the high work ethic necessary to just keep up 
with everyone else. The endless hours spent in a cluster, 
in lab, or at the library, can frighten any unsuspecting 
new student. When asked by peers at other colleges 
how they spent their Wednesday nights, a popular CMU 
response is: Oh, I have to turn in a five-page proof of the 
Stackelburg Equilibrium to my professor tomorrow, finish 
up a program for 15-212, write a 17-page paper analyzing 
the effects of imperialism in Asian countries, and maybe 
fit in some reading for Organizational Behavior.
Compared with the typical response at other universities
 Im going to a movie, taking an extra long nap, and 
then finishing my fill-in-the-blank worksheet  its no 
wonder CMU students have earned the reputation of 
students who never stop studying.
Whether this phenomenon is out of choice or necessity is 
debatable. Judging from a popular motto every Carnegie 
Mellon student should be familiar with by now  my 
heart is in the work  no one should be surprised that 
students here take their studies seriously. Everyone is 
trying to outdo everyone else. Undoubtedly, the end 
result is clear: you have a school with increasingly harder 
standards that are seemingly impossible to attain.
The Science and Humanities Scholars (SHS), Bachelors 
of Humanities and Arts (BHA), and Bachelors of Science 
and Arts (BSA) programs are all programs that have 
been tailor-made for CMU to satisfy this cultural need 
for cross-disciplinary study. Because so many talented 
students enter CMU, one of the difficulties they encounter 
is choosing whether they should be in the humanities, 
arts, or sciences. While they may perform well in all
these subjects, and have an interest in learning diverse 
topics, choosing one field over another is a difficult task 
to tackle. Thus, these interdisciplinary programs offer 
students a chance to explore several of their interests, 
instead of being limited to one.
One of the benefits of the BHA and BSA programs is that 
it makes it easier for students to pursue their interests 
without worrying about doubleor even triple-majoring. 
Essentially, these programs are composed of two 
components: a fine arts concentration and a science or 
humanities concentration. Although some BHA and BSA 
students choose to double-major, the interdisciplinary 
curriculum has already been integrated into the program, 
so this becomes less of a concern for them.
Patricia Maurides, the director of the BHA and BSA
David Kjos/Art Staff
programs, said that BHA and BSA are rigorous programs 
because people need to qualify for med school and 
graduate school. Thus, BSA and BHA students 
planning to pursue medical school, law school, and 
graduate school, are equipped with the knowledge and 
skills necessary to delve deeper into either direction.
Maurides added that Students get a broader education 
because they get to individualize their curriculum by 
blending their interests and exploring the connections 
between their concentrations.
The SHS program, on the other hand, seeks to draw 
students with interests in the humanities and sciences. 
As students of the Mellon College of Science and the 
College of Humanities and Social Sciences, these 
students are given a unique opportunity to draw on their 
achievements in the humanities, natural sciences, 
mathematics, and/or social sciences, and then select a 
major in MCS, H&SS, or both.
While double-majoring is prevalent among students in 
the program, it is not by any means a requirement.
You can be polygamous and have more than one major, 
chuckled William Alba, the director of the Science and 
Humanities Scholars Program. On the other 
hand, though, he commented, The alternative to 
double-majoring is that a student can delve deeply into 
their own major and take courses outside their discipline 
to discover how other people see the world.
The need felt to double-major has become something 
that cant be ignored but also cant be achieved without 
making serious sacrifices in terms of extracurricular 
activities, naps, eating, and other human activities. Its 
a situation where students try to overachieve to gain 
a competitive edge, but end up being just an average 
student because everyone at CMU is doing the same 
thing. Although double-majoring might not be 
exceptional on this campus, CMU ranks relatively high in 
terms of job placement after graduation. This must mean 
that somewhere outside the CMU stress bubble, someone 
already sees CMU students as successful.

---------------------------------------------------

Negotiations for officially combining the two organiza
tions, which started in early 2005, were concluded late 
this summer. The boards of both the Pittsburgh Center for 
the Arts and Pittsburgh Filmmakers unanimously voted to 
join the two nonprofit organizations. The merger is likely 
to be finalized in November, when the membership of 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers convenes to vote. With the merger, 
the Center and Filmmakers hope to remain two strong 
contributors to the Pittsburgh visual arts tradition.
The Man Behind the Merger
Charlie Humphrey has been a contributor to Pittsburghs 
cultural life since the early 1980s, first as a producer at 
WQED radio and later as an editor of an underground 
newspaper, before moving on to take the position of 
executive director at Pittsburgh Filmmakers. He is an 
outspoken participant in Pittsburghs art community, 
advertising Filmakers as an accessible resource and 
contributing articles and editorials to publications such 
as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He vocally supports the 
importance of a rich art arena in the community.
According to Humphrey, Pittsburghs strong traditions in 
both education and philanthropy positively contribute 
to its art scene. Arts thrive in places where they are 
supported, he noted. Humphrey views Pittsburgh as a 
city in which creative colleges and universities give room 
to creative communities.... We have patrons who just love 
[the arts]; per capita it is quite unusual.
Now Humphrey is working to guarantee that both the 
Pittsburgh Center for the Arts and Pittsburgh Filmmakers 
will continue to focus on their missions to bring highquality art education and visual art resources to everyone 
in the community. Humphrey envisions that the merger 
will bring about new programs directed for children, 
as well as more support for individual artists, thanks to 
increased resources that the Center of the Arts will now 
have access to.
Whats in it for Students
The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts offers classes in 
everything from creative writing, to fiber and decorative 
art, to printmaking and book arts. The center also
showcases the work of many local artists. With no

their inner George Lucas.
Pittsburghs visual arts were saved from near ruin last 
year. But just because the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts 
isnt doomed to close doesnt mean that students should 
hold off on visiting the Center. With dozens of classes to 
choose from, the programs at the Center and Filmmakers 
are worth enrolling in. Taught by experts, these classes 
are a great way to explore your creativity, talents, and 
learn more about Pittsburghs culture. With such great 
resources only blocks away, there is no reason to hesitate 
taking advantage of these cultural hubs any longer.

Big Als Metal Review
Symphony of destruction: Exodus and Chimaira return triumphantly
Remember the last time you got cut off in traffic? Yeah, 
you do. When dealing with the aggressive drivers of the 
world, it helps to have a CD that lets you deal with your 
anger. Luckily, thats my specialty: Exoduss stunning new 
album comes to mind. Or how about Clevelands favorite 
sons, Chimaira?
You see, both bands have gone through lineup changes 
since their last album. Chimaira has tried to match Spinal 
Tap in the drummer category; Exodus, having lost the. 
beloved Paul Baloff to a stroke a few years ago, return 
with only Gary Holt from the classic line-up on this latest 
and perhaps greatest album, Shovel Headed Kill Machine. 
Album title of the year, no doubt. And so much more.
Since establishing themselves alongside heavyweights 
like Metallica and Testament as founders of the seminal 
Bay Area thrash movement in the early 80s, the members 
of Exodus have struggled to stay in the limelight. They 
may have surrendered Kirk Hammett to Metallica, but 
they stuck to their guns, and produced (barely) above
ground classics such as Bonded by Blood. Shovel Headed 
Kill Machine, on the other hand, is a departure from their 
original sound that is more than welcome. It was needed, 
actually. More Machine Head than Metallica in reference, 
Exodus reinvents itself here. New singer Rob Dukes mixes 
a dash of Vulgar-era Phil into his delivery, Paul Bostaph 
beats the hell out of his drums like he did in Slayer, and 
Holts riffs linger in your brain long after the leads kick in.
Some may see this as a stab at staying current; I see this as 
the masters showing how its going to be. Well done!
On the other hand, if youre in the mood for a little more 
mechanized violence, then Chimairas newest, self-titled
\

A scene of chaos from Exodus packed performance.
album is an awesome way to go. The sonic booms in 
Nothing Remains will match the shattering glass, and 
the rest of the album; if you like your metal dense and 
layered, look no further. Like Exoduss latest, Chimaira 
takes many references in its workearly Exodus, in fact, 
is one of them. The throwbacks to early riffmeisters only 
complement the intricate work here. Distracted by the 
force of the guitar work, the listener risks missing out on 
the strange sounds lurking in the background.
Like a good movie director who plants visual goodies 
for audiences to pick up on during their second and 
third viewing of the film, Chimaira has deposited minisoundscapes right in the middle of their-songs. Salvation 
is a good example: A hollow-sounding riff dissipates into 
a breakdown, with standard screaming and angry lyrics. 
Cool, but listen again. Really, wind up the song again, and 
ignore it all. Do you hear the keyboards? Bad-ass.
No band can work without a solid rhythm section, and 
newcomer Kevin Talley (Dying Fetus) anchors it all. Hate 
to say it, but he fits this band way better than Andols or 
Ricky ever did. With Talley in place, this band feels like a 
machine with all its parts locked in, working cohesively. 
Even the keyboard player fits in well, something that 
didnt happen in their debut, The Impossibility of Reason. 
Like the director, Chris Spicuzza is the final key here, and 
his vision pays off as he leans back and inserts himself 
when needed, and when unexpected.
Wind it up again!
All the best,

An American in Paris
Wednesday, October 5 
@8,10,12
Back in the old days, Americans didnt 
hate the French. In fact, they regularly 
lived in cities such as Paris, much as the 
title of this film implies. If you havent 
heard of it, An American in Paris is a 
prototypical early 1950s musical with 
Gene Kelly. Its about love and art and 
the idyllic beauty that is Paris, as well 
as how confused and flustered people 
get when, as IMDb puts it, romantic 
complications abound. And abound 
they do.
M. Hulots Holiday
Thursday, October 6 
@8,10,12
Think of this as Mr. Bean at a gorgeous 
French beach resort. Oh, and in French. 
The fact that its both in a foreign lan
guage and a half-century old only 
makes the standard slapstick humor in 
M. Hulots Holiday funnier. Looking at 
European culture through an outsiders 
lens can be very, very funny at times, 
especially when set in the 1950s. Id be 
willing to put money on the fact that 
some rich old lady gets a pie (or other 
baked good) to the face at some point 
in the course of this film.
Kung Fu Hustle
Friday, October 7 
@8,10,12
Have you seen Shaolin Soccer? Stephen 
Chow is at it again with another surreal 
martial arts comedy. Kung Fu Hustle 
has the same weird out-of-place dance 
numbers that were unfortunately cut 
from the American version of Shaolin 
Soccer  you simply cant understand 
how bizarre the mind of Stephen Chow 
is without them. Its hard to explain 
what to expect from Kung Fu Hustle  
think a really goofy Jackie Chan movie 
with even more absurd fight scenes, 
even poorer subtitling, and even less 
seriousness.
Kicking and Screaming
Saturday, October 8 
@8,10,12
Oh, Will Ferrell, you were in so many 
movies this summer... and this one is 
supposed to be the worst. The movie 
has a simple plot: Will Ferrell coaches 
his kids soccer team and acts like Will 
Ferrell around them. The team has to 
win a game to prove themselves or 
something. The fact is that Will Ferrell 
is funny when he has people to be funny 
with, but when hes wandering around 
just being Will Ferrell, hes simply sort 
of annoying  and thats the case in 
Kicking and Screaming. Of course, you 
dont actually have anything better to 
do Saturday night, and it is only a 
dollar...
Nicotina
Sunday, October 9 
@8,10,12
The main character of Nicotina is a 
geek, which is good because movies 
starring geeks are usually entertain
ing. This time around, the geek gets 
involved with the Russian mob in a 
complex snafu that comes together 
through several different subplots. 
Some critics have said that the movie 
feels like a Mexican Guy Ritchie 
movie, which could be a good thing 
depending on your taste in films. But if 
nothing else, it should be an enjoyable 
crime caper, albeit one with subtitles.

HOROSCOPES.
BY ASHLEIGH MOLZ
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Were coming up to 2006 here at 
CMU. If you graduated from high school in the early '90s, maybe 
you should consider graduating from here soon too.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): You will stub your toe today. Watch 
out.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Theres an old saying that you 
should beware of one with a" honeyed tongue and a sword .in 
the belly." Dont take my word for it, but that may describe your 
roommate perfectly, if you know what I mean.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Did you notice that the leaves are 
changing colors already? Your skin will get whiter. Watch out for 
the sun; it wants to give you cancer.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Dont let anyone get you down today 
with their criticism. You shouldnt let people make decisions for 
you.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Youll find a penny, but 
(of course, with your luck) it will be tail side up. Dont touch it! 
Unless you want to die in a vat of hydrochloric acid with your 
enemies laughing maniacally at your pitiful demise.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 22): The place where you live 
is falling apart. Watch out for open manholes. Study hard for 
that next exam and you will do better than if you did not study 
at all.
SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21): Perhaps you should 
change your lock, because I have the key.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): This week you 
will travel the world far and wide, and go on amazing adventures 
that you will tell your grandchildren about someday. Or you may 
travel far and wide throughout campus, losing your mind again to 
the soulless machine we all work for. Either way, you'll tell your 
grandchildren.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Whatever you do, 
dont change the layout of your home this week. It could have 
disastrous consequences.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): An attractive lady will 
have a message for you. Pay attention!
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): If you decide to be nicer than 
usual to your partner today, you will avoid argument. Try doing 
this on a regular basis.
