Students, Faculty March to Construction Site; 
Joint Senate Meeting Reports to University
by ERICA BORDEN
Last week the Tartan reported 
that in a Student Senate meet
ing Michael Armentrout propos
ed a statement to be sent to Dr. 
Stever indicating that a demon
stration on the C;MU campus 
was about as unlikely as a me
teor hitting Warner Hall. and 
that he should be concerned 
about more important things.
That statement, and others that 
have previously been made abou 
our campus, have been proven 
false in this unique week of firsts.
Students and faculty have been 
united as never before. Not 
only do the resolutions passed 
by both the Student and Faculty 
Senates indicate joint support; 
but the joint meeting Wednes
day afternoon also testifies to the 
fact.
President Stever for the first 
time (or at least as long as I 
have been here) has addressed 
the entire University com
munity about his position on a 
specific issue. We may not agree 
with the content of his state
ment, but we must admire the 
process. Monday afternoons 
meetings in the various depart
ments demonstrated one of the 
most free and open discussions 
this campus has ever witnessed.
Apathetic was the word most 
frequently used to describe CMU in past years. The fact that 
an issue not directly affecting 
the lives of the members of the 
community (like food service for 
example) has aroused this much 
action and reaction, testifies to 
the fact that that is no longer the 
appropriate portrayal.
There are many other as
pects of this past weeks acti
vities which have not, as yet, 
been sufficiently analyzed or 
evaluated. Yet we cannot doubt 
that this new campus mood will 
be reflected in future Univer
sity decisions.
A joint Student-Faculty Sen
ate meeting Wednesday afternoon, 
the first of its kind, discussed 
both the report and findings of 
the Committee of Nine appoint
ed by President Stever in his 
statement of September 15 and 
a report of Tuesdays demonstra
tion.
The meeting was chaired by 
the President of the Faculty Sen
ate, Professor James Langer, 
with the aid of the Chairman of 
the Student Senate, Patrick Cavanagh.
Professor Myron Joseph de
livered the report of the Com
mittee of Nine. He stated that the 
purpose of the Committee was 
to investigate how the school 
might act to support the general 
goals of the Black Construction 
Coalition and to avoid a violent 
confrontation between the stu
dents and workers.
Before giving the recommenda
tions of the group, Professor 
Joseph reported that the cost of a 
construction shut down on this 
campus has been re-estimated to 
be between $30.000 and $60.000 
per week. It has previously been 
stated that the cost would be ap
proximately $25,k00 per day. The 
$60,000 figure does not include 
general labor costs.
The Committee recommended 
the following provisions: (1) a 
campus construction shut-down for 
reasons of public safety ac
companied by a statement indi
cating the shut-down was also a 
result of the failure of the negotiatoons to produce a just re
sult and support of the goals of 
the Black Construction Coal
ition, (2) Immediate action to ex
amine our constructors compli
ance with federal fair employ
ment laws and (3) establish
ment of University criteria for 
equal employment to be included 
in all future contracts.
Wednesday morning the Com
mittee reconvened to discuss
Swank Quizzed at Rally
by JAMIE EDLIN
After reading the memoran
dum stated by President Stever, 
Dean Swank opened the rally to 
questions and answers from the 
participants.
The first comment concerned 
itself with the stopping of con
struction on campus. Dean Swank 
replied that the University is 
presently ' under no com
mitment to stop construction. 
This was immediately followed 
by inquiry into the future em
ployment measures on campus 
and if any step would be taken 
to rectify the situation here. 
Last week President Stever ap
pointed an advisery committee 
consisting of students, faculty, 
and administration to assist in 
additional recommendations f 
the problem. This committee 
still functions. The statement read 
previously was recommended to 
President Stever from the con
ferences on Monday within the 
departments.
One student asked what the situ
ation would be if step one is pro
mulgated. What side would the 
University take if suit is filed? 
Would it enter the action as a 
friend of the court or a friend of 
the coalition? The answer was 
that the University would do 
everything it could do within 
reason. By committing itself to 
the action that it has now un
dertaken, by supporting the de
mands of the coalition, it has 
committed itself to achieve results 
through it.
Students, quick to challenge the 
memorandum issued by Stever, 
requested a statement on the 
length of time it would take for 
the appropriate Federal agencies 
to undertake a compliance review 
of construction projects. At 
least twenty-four hours to make 
certain that the request has been 
made, responded Dean Swank. 
Another observer offered a par
tial answer. The Federal com
pliance standards result from 
the type of review that we are 
requesting. Once they are develop
ed then they must be tested in 
the courts.
It was questionned whether 
President Steverhad the power to 
halt construction. Subject to 
those legal restructions under 
contract obligations, yes. No, the 
trustees do not make the de
cisions, though they are inform
ed of such decisions while they 
are developing, a response to 
further investigations by the 
audience.
In regard to inquiry into pre
sent actions, the impact and re
sponse to these actions, and the 
negotiations that will now hope
fully begin, Dean Swank con
tinued that actions have the pos
sibility of having great impact on 
the negotiations downtown. Be
cause we are involving the Fed
eral government in the basic is
sue  the equality of opportunity  
there is possibility in major fo
cus on the correct issue and in 
promptness. If there is action and
(Continued on Page 11)
what actions had been made con
cerning the commitments con
tained in President Stevers Fri
day afternoon memorandum.
It was reported that the Presi
dent Stever has sent a telegram 
to President Nixon and his At
torney General. (See text page 10). 
The telegram will be followed up 
to determine the federal,adminis
trations reaction. Professor Jos
eph reported.
The University has taken ac
tion for a compliance review, 
he added. Two inspectors from the 
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, based in Phil
adelphia. have been instructed 
to investigate our contractors 
and subcontractors com
pliance with federal laws.
The possibilities of closing 
down the sites and renegotiat
ing the contract were discussed, 
the tentative opinion was that 
with the Dick Corporation, cur
rent pssessor of the fraternity 
complex contract, there is a pos
sibility that the University might 
be able to arrange for a shut 
down. Professor Joseph stated 
that with the computer contract 
there is no basis for the owners,
i.e. The University, to shut down 
the site without paying damages
($60.000 per week). The cost of 
terminating the contract has been 
estimated at $2.5 million.
To renegotiate the contract to 
include provisions which are 
presently omitted seems to be im
possible unless a lever can be 
found to convince the con
tractors to agree to the renego
tiation.
Out of the Committee report 
also came the finding that if the 
University does not act in face of 
the disruption, the contractors 
can take actions to remove tres
passers and protect the site.
Professor Joseph concluded 
his report by stating that he felt 
that the University should in
fluence the behavior of other 
builders by taking a strong lead
ership role in establishing and 
forcing strict compliance stand
ards.
Questions were directed to 
Prof. Joseph from the audience. 
The first question concerned the 
present work force which appears 
to be integrated although it in
volves primarily unskilled work
ers. The question was that com
pliance standards would be en
forced at a later stage in the 
work when primarily skilled lab
orers would be involved and the
force would not be as well inte
grated. The check will not be 
one of numbers, Prof. Joseph 
replied. The investigation will 
concern whether or not the con
tractors are taking affirmative 
actions to comply with the stand
ards.
What happens if contractor 
is not in compliance? one stu
dent asked.
Then there is a breach of con
tract and we can renegotiate the 
contract, was the answer.
It was not known how long it 
will take to receive a judge
ment on whether or not our con
tractors are in compliance.
The Universitys lawyer who 
was present at the meeting made 
several legal points clear. He 
stated that the contract gives the 
contractors certain responsibili
ties for the protection of the site 
and that protection included keep
ing the access roads which feed 
the site free of obstructions. 
He commented further that the 
contract gives the contractors 
certain responsibilities for the 
protection of the site and that pro
tection included keeping the ac
cess roads which feed the site 
free of obstructions. He com( Continued on Page 10)
GSIA Passes Seven Resolutions
by JENIFER DIGBY
GSIA and AMS students and 
faculty met at 3:00 Monday in 
GSIAs auditorium to discuss the 
Departments position in the 
Black Coalition controversy. Un
like other meetings being held 
on campus at the same time, the 
GSIA debate was quieter, more 
orderly, and probably produced 
the most results in terms of 
depth and quantity of resolutions 
passed.
There were seven resolutions 
in all which came out of the 
GSIA debates, chaired by Prof
essor Cyert. The first was pro
posed by Martin Geisel, and pas
sed 51-for, 24-against, and 35- 
undecided because of insufficient 
information. The proposal: Wheras, H. Guyford Stever has con
tinuously failed to cope with the 
complex problems of this Uni
versity, and
Wheras, he has again and 
again displayed this inability in 
his address this morning.
Therefore, be it resolved that 
we have no confidence in Presi
dent Stevers ability to resolve 
the current and future problems 
of this University.
The second proposal, dealing 
directly with University action 
in the Black controversy, was in
troduced by Tom Kerr, GSIA
lecturer, lawyer, and head of the 
Pgh Civil Liberties Union. The 
proposal resolved that the Uni
versity, by its Trustees or Presi
dent or both, directly urge the 
President of the United States 
and his Attorney General to au
thorize the U. S. Attorney Gen
eral for the Western District of 
Pennsylvania to bring suit with 
the United States as party 
plaintiff against the craft unions 
under Title VII of the Civil 
Richts Act of 1964 to examine 
the unions state of compliance 
with the fair employment pract
ices required by that act, and, if 
necessary bring them into com
pliance.
Kerrs recommendation was pas
sed by the GSIA group 102-for, 
3-opposed, 2-undecided. Skmilar 
proposals were brought up at most 
of the other departmental meet
ings on Monday and passed with 
similar margins.
The third GSIA proposal was 
similar to the first No-Confidence 
proposal. In his proposal, Thomas 
Morgan elaborated on the parti
culars against the President with 
regards to his handling of the 
construction issue, and moved for 
severe censure. The vote was 
78-5-5.
Proposal Four resolved that the 
University make a public state
ment that all future construc
tion contracts contain a clause 
that minority groups be adequate
ly represented in the labor force, 
and urge that sister institutions 
do the same.
Five resolved that a commit
tee investigate the terms of the 
Universitys contracts ... to de
termine the Universitys liabili
ties which may result from shut
down of construction. The vote 
in support was unanimous.
The sixth proposal was uni
formly put forth by all other 
departmental meetings on the 
BCC question. It urged that the 
University publicly endorse and 
back the needs and demands of 
the BCC for improved hiring prac
tices in Pgh. craft unions.
GSIA, in its final resolution, 
supported the shut-down of all 
campus construction until settle
ment of the dispute between con
struction unions and the Black 
Coalition. The GSIA group also 
endorsed non - violent direct 
student and faculty action in con
cordance with the BCC to close 
construction.
Resolved further, that in the 
event of the interference by po
lice or other outside forces that 
we will strike against CMU by 
refusing to teach or attend clas
ses.
H and SS Discusses Discrimination
by JENIFER DIGBY
An emergency meeting of the 
College of Humanities and So
cial Sciences was called for 3:30 
Monday afternoon in the Wherrett Room. Dean Steinberg mod
erated the vigorous debate which 
centered on the issue of racial 
discrimination by labor unions 
operating on C-MU construc
tion sites.
There was considerable reac
tion to President Stevers embar
rassing remarks at an earlier 
meeting Tuesday, but endorse
ment of the GSIA-drafted pro
posal to severly censure the Presi
dent was quickly labelled in
appropriate and tabled.
More notable results of the
H&SS meeting were several 
resolutions couched by various 
members of the History Depart
ment and passed on to Steinberg 
for reference to Stever at an 8:00 
meeting The recommendations 
were to represent a majority op
inion from within the College re
garding possible positions for the 
University to assume and actions 
to take.
Chief in importance was a gen
eral resolution that the Univer
sity take a strong stand in support 
of the Black Construction Coali
tion. Dr. Levys original work
ing was carefully revised by Her
bert Simon to say in effect, that 
the H & SS College supported the 
demands of the BCC for equal and 
appropriate membership of Ne
gros in trade unions.
Another recommendation urged 
that the University itself make 
every effort to renogitiate pre
sent contracts with the con
struction companies to insure 
equal employment opportunity 
at work sites on our campus.
A third proposal drawn up ear
lier at a GSIA session was pas
sed by H& SS. The proposal, at
tributed to Thomas Kerr primarily, 
called upon the University to re
quest through the District Attor
neys office in Washington that 
the District Attorney of Western 
Pennsylvania (Richard Thorn
burgh) be authorized to prosecute 
the labor unions. Reasoning be
hind this move was that viola( Continued on Page 11)

Please Ignore
Editor. The Tartan:
Students have pointed out to me 
that you published excerpts of 
a discussion paper of mine in 
your September 19 issue, under 
the title of Bonfenbrenner 
Views Dissent.
You would have a perfect right 
to do this if the article had al
ready appeared elsewhere, or 
if I had presented it to you for 
possible publication. Actually 
you obtained a coyp which was 
circulated privately, and which 
no longer expresses my position ac
curately. (The draft in question 
was written almost a year ago, 
and has since had the benefit 
of a number of useful com
ments both here and elsewhere.)
In general, when on publish
es something of this kind, one 
checks with the writer in ad
vance. Yournown procedure is 
in the best traditions of William 
Randolph Hearst and Colonel 
McCormick, but have you no 
better models to follow?

Color Him $$
Editor, The Tartan:
Hellalujah! The Thistles Mes
siah has arrived in the form of 
Michael Armentrout.
At todays Student Senate 
meeting, Mr. Armentrout re
solutely backed a $4000 additional 
appropriation to the Thistle. 
This amount was needed to of
fset increased expenditures. 
Approximately 50 per cent of 
this would cover the color pho
tography which Mr. Armentrout 
advocates for the upcoming 
Thistle.
The finance committees re
commendation was unclear as to 
just how much would go for 
color; Mr. Armentrouts lengthy 
rhetoric failed to clarify the 
issue. The $2,000 figure is about 
the closest guess which we were 
given.
After the meeting. Mr. Armen
trout informed this senator that 
he had only accepted the lead
ership of the Thistle as a per
sonal project to see whether he 
could raise the publications 
quality. Such selfless dedica
tion to the CMU student body is 
to be admired, or is it?
Why should the student gov
ernment of CMU underwrite Mr. 
Armentrouts personal project? 
Clarly, he feels that color photo
graphy is just the boost which 
the Thistle needs to achieve artLETTERS TO THE EDITOR
istic success. Of course, it seems 
that color photography is also  
happy coincidence  Mr. Armen

Lousy color photography will 
sell no more Thistles than poor

did. If Mr. Armentrout is fas

he should ilduldge his fascina

C-MAP
Editor. The Tartan;
Last Fridays "Firing Line 
program featuring Dr. Norman 
Johnson, director of the C-MAP 
program, may have provided a 
platform for some white stu
dents to exhibit their pathetic 
guilt-induced needs to be accepttedand loved by black students, 
and many also have served to 
answer some questions students 
had about the program, but it 
raised as many questions as it 
answered, both about the CMAP program, and about educa
tional policy generally:
1. Dr. Johnson stated that the 
decision to house entering male 
C-MAP students on a single floor 
of the dorm was made for ad
ministrative reasons, not for 
reasons of racial segregation or 
separatism. In view of the pre
sent controversy over the hous
ing arrangement, it might be well 
for Dr. Johnson to specify in 
more detail just what considera
tions led to his decision. Until 
this is done, the suspicion will re
main that the decision was in 
fact motivated by the desire to 
segregate living arrangements 
in the dorms.
2. A girl in the audience point
ed out that coed E & S students 
had for some time been housed 
on their own floor of the dor
mitory, and suggested that the 
housing arrangement for C-MAP 
students was no different. I find 
both objectionable. One of the 
most educational aspects of my 
college experience, and of 
others I know, was the oppor
tunity to meet and learn from peo
ple of widely different backgrounds, 
interests, national and ethnic 
origins. Any arrangement that di
minishes the opportunity to de
velop such cross-cultural learn
ing experiences is in my opinion 
highly questionable. A number 
of students to whom I have spok
en have complained about 
barriers between fine arts stu
dents and science students. Seg
regation of the dorms by subject 
major clearly strengthens such 
barriers, while a policy of dis
persal would help to remove 
them.
3. During the question period,
I asked what, if any, steps were 
being taken to recruit black 
faculty. Dr. Johnson suggested 
that I question a dean on this 
point, but the dean to whom he 
referred me hastened from the 
room before I could ask him. In 
view of Dr. Stevers remark that 
the universitys hiring practices 
were as qustionable as those of 
the construction unions (this 
comes as no surprise to anyone 
who ever looked at the com
plexion of the faculty), this ques
tion should be answered.
4. Two-thirds of Pittsburghs 
poor families are white, yet CMAP is apparently exclusively 
oriented toward low-income blacks. 
The need for educational op
portunities in the black com
munity is great  so great, 
obviously, that C-MAP alone 
could never hope to deal ade
quately with the need  but lowincome whites also need an edu
cation, and one wonders whe
ther they have to riot to get an 
an education, or whether, just once, 
the need couldnt be recognized, 
and action taken, before that 
happens?
5. Questions of housing in
volve students primarily, and 
other members of the academic 
community only secondarily. 
Shouldnt students play a major 
role in making decisions in this 
area?

Editor. The Tartan:
As a Carnegie graduate <M

University had instituted a recrui

dents. I was thus doubly appalled 
to learn of the program's blantant paternalism vis a vis hous
ing and special courses for CMAP participants. I fail to see 
how the University can be en
riched by the presence of stu
dents whom it fails to respect as 
human beings. There areplaces 
for both segregated housing fac
ilities and remedial programs, 
but not where C-MAP has loca

separate themselves. Any sep
aration which is not volitional is 
of necessity racist. Similarly, I 
find the idea that C-MUs AfroAmerican students automatically 
need remedial and quasi-remedial courses totally offensive. The 
absolute condition of remedial 
courses is not race but need, and 
unless this need has been de
monstrated for each member of 
the course, the course functions 
as a means of repression rather 
than of liberation.
I would strongly urge that 
C-MU decide what its purpose 
is in bringing Afro-American stu
dents into the University under 
this program. Carnegie-Mellon 
has an enormous amount to gain 
by going beyond its white, mid
dle-class orientation, and 
C-MAP offers a potential oppor
tunity for this enlargement. Token
ism and discrimination are forms 
of repression which will not en
courage any C-MUs students

gence.

Heartbroken
Editor, The Tartan
In response to the letter from

of September 23. 1969. This is 
to let the Mudgenities know that 
we are heartbroken to hear 
that they are heartbroken, and 
that the best broken heart spec
ialists on campus can be found on 
the second floor, right wing of 
Scobell Hall. There is no wait
ing. no appointments, twenty-four

calls.
The Scobellians
Lacking Tact
Editor, The Tartan:
Tuesday, certain individuals 
took the occassion of the stu
dent demonstrations to deface 
several university buildings. 
Such forms of protest seem ir
responsible and destructive and 
demonstrate a lack of respect, 
which may be justified in times 
like these; but no powerful insti
tution can be improved or dis
solved without first granting it the 
respect its existence demands. In 
such a confrontation between stu
dents and the administration, 
tact is essential. No one is wil
ling to listen to or be persuaded by 
rowdyism, regardless of its in
tentions.
Violence and destruction from 
any direction is not a necessary 
condition for improvement; and 
irresponsible, random or misdrected actions intended to de
monstrate protest are useless. We 
cannot allow ourselves to answer 
indiscriminate, stupid action with 
indiscriminate stupidity of our 
own. The situation demands tact  
a quality not characteristic of stu
dent protests. If protests are to 
have any effect, they must solicit 
the respect of the adminis
tration. Painting on walls or hurl
ing obscenities at opponents are 
actions characteristically juven
ile and should be discarded.

October 15 Vietnam Moratorium 
To Organize Opposition To War
On October 15, six major colleg
es and universities in the Pitts
burgh area will be suspending their 
normal academic routines to de
vote the day to activities concern
ed with the Vietnam War and Am
ericas militarism. This Vietnam 
Moratorium is part of a nation
wide movement to suspend busin
ess as usual on and off campus 
to focus attention on the unabated 
war in Vietnam. The moratoria 
will continue, extending by one day 
per month, until a negotiated set
tlement is reached or a definite 
commitment to troop withdrawal 
made.
Because of the Administrations 
excellent public relations work in 
the area of token troop withdraw
als and cancellation of draft callups, many Americans are possess
ed by the reassuring feeling the 
war is somehow acquiring popu
lar support. The moratorium and 
other peace activities this Fall 
are intended to bring home to the 
people of the United States that 
the government will end the war 
only when it is continually and 
forcefully told to do so by every 
section of the population.
The national Vietnam Morator
ium Committee and moratorium 
workers on local campuses are 
designing activities that will in
volve the broadest possible part
icipation. In areas where the Un
iversity sentiment against the war 
is firm and well organized, stu
dents will spend the day doing 
community canvassing and organ
izing to solidify non-academic op
position to the war. On less arous
ed campuses the effort will be dir
ected toward making students and 
faculty clearly aware of the wars 
impact on the country and on their 
own lives, and toward involving 
them in a steady offensive against 
the war.
Activities in Pittsburgh will in
volve a wide spectrum of actionoriented informational programs:
debates, discussions -- in and out 
of class, lectures, rallies, films, 
dramatic presentations and petit
ion campaigns relevant to the war 
and the university. Issues will be 
illuminated and plans for on
going action, formulated.
People at Carnegie-Mellon who 
want to work on the moratorium 
should contact Tom Burgess.

The concern manifested at the 
conference is a result of fears that 
should the explosion become un
wieldy, the U.S. might, in a frenzy 
of altruism, futilely deplete its na
tural resources.
One of the suggestions submit
ted at the conference was that in 
1976, the bicentennial anniversary 
of the nation, a "pregnant pause,, 
be initiated-as complete a suspen
sion of reproduction as could be or
ganized.
Dr. Donald Aitken. a Stanford 
University astrophysicist and con
sultant on the Apollo project, re
marked that the Government will 
have to proclaim compulsory birth 
control in the near future, regard
less of religious and personal con
victions.
With Re-Issued Album
by Tom Davis
Maybe a lot of people have heard 
of Flashing. Maybe you hav
ent. Ive never heard a song from 
it on any radio station. But the 
fact remains: this album weighs a 
ton. which is to say, its mighty 
heavy.
Id never heard of Curtis Knight 
before Id heard this album. I'll 
speculate that Flashing was a
C. Knight vehicle, something 
to get him established in the bus
iness. Ill also speculate that 
they used a guitarist to back him 
up. However, at the time this al
bum was made (1965) nobodvknew 
that the guitarist. Jimi Hendrix, 
would establish somewhat of a 
career of his own later on. The 
album must have been a real tur
key.
Then, later on, Jimi Hendrix 
made a name for himself and re
corded his own albums on a differ
ent label. Anxious to get in on a 
good thing, the company re-issued 
(I guess) Flashing. It was 
still a real bomb. But on to the 
content of the record.
There arent enough superla
tives in the dictionary to describe 
how really excellent this record 
is. Hendrixs style was firmly es
tablished even in 1965. With Curt
is Knight's wailing, bluesy, gutsy 
voice backed up by Jimi's ripply, 
melodic picking, the album can't 
do anything but flash.
Ive never seen the album any
where but at Sears and Roebuck. 
Even if you have to out out of your 
way to get it. GET IT. Youll real
ly wonder how you got along with
out it.

To Begin | 
Sixth Year
ON PICKING ON LIBERALS
Disgust has finally overcome apathy. If finally being prodded into 
rectifying this great flaw of the TARTAN. That is, the fact that the 
TARTAN is stuffed with rehashed articles from PRAVDA. I happen to 
think that the TARTAN has negligible objectity and presents a some
what misconstrued idea of what everybodys thinking on campus. I also 
have plenty of nodding heads to back me up. The outcome is this col
umn, co-authored with Jim Jacks. Well try to alter the picture a little 
in the interest of dissenting opinion (such an integral part of todays 
student mind set).
First, I think some basic ground rules should be set forth. Most im
portantly, understand that Im not trying to proselytize anyone. Its a 
free country and you're entitled to your own thought-out opinion-stupid 
as it may be. This provides a good introduction to the other golden rule. 
Tongue-in-cheek comments are probably going to sneak in now and 
again, and more than likely theyre apt to be quite cynical. In short, if 
you start to get hypersensitive about any of these opinions, forget it. I 
couldn't care less.
Undoubtedly the best place to start jumping on the cretins of the left 
is at the guru level. There are a lot of people who think the liberals in 
the U.S. have seen their zenith and are well on their way down. I don't 
quite agree with this abyssal theory. Left. New Left, or Leftists looking 
right at the New Leftists-the species hasn't quite reached the ecological 
niche of the gooney bird (except in likeness). As Chicago, the U.S. Con
gress. and Berkeley can testify, these paradigms of humanistic logic are 
still vocally in evidence.
But where are the leaders of this grand American tradition? I wish
I knew. I'd like to pick on them. Naturally, its always difficult to pin 
down the head spokesman for the loyal oppositn. Still its funny. This 
time last year twere more liberal experts on the ills of the nation 
than there are rats in Texarkana. I guess the 1968 elections wasted a lot 
of talent in defeat (except for that Jr. High School idol Allard Lowestein). Nonetheless, lets take a look around and see who might take 
command of the Liberal brain trustj
First lets take the 1968 Democratic standard bearer-Hubertissimo 
(absolutely no relation to pianissimo). Taking up as Minnesotas doer 
of good deeds where Will and Charlie Mayo left off. this Farrago of Pal
aver is cooling his heels on the college campus. That may not be the 
place to do that these days, although its a great place to start back up 
the ladder of success. Just ask President Perkins. Can you imagine 
having to sit in his class and listen to him? Better bring a pillow. It 
isn't like a political rally where you can easily duck out saying you have 
to go to the bathroom or have to drive some skid row bum to the polls. I 
understand that Hube the Cube is going to be running for the Senate. 
Not a bad idea. Then he could jump on Tricky Dicky without looking like 
a sore loser. But before he gets to overtax the Senate air conditioning 
system he has to win the election. That should be easy. Besides all the 
campaign hot air might draw some of the winter tourists away from 
Florida. Meanwhile we timorously await his august return.
Edmund Muskie, however, is in the Senate. Hes a big pollution 
man. Better yet, hes ethnic. You know. Polish-American. That must 
make the hearts of all hyphenated Americans palpitate a bit faster. Al
though he was a V-P candidate, hes not near the top of the heap yet. 
He's not obnoxious enough. Hes being sneaky though. While lying low 
in the Senate, hes surreptitiously forming brain power to advise him 
on all issues, so he can ambush the nation with facts in 1972. Damned if
I know what he would do with facts, though. They dont translate into 
votes. Furthermore, why would a liberal want to adulterate his obfus
cations with anything so logical as facts? As long as he brushes up on 
his polka, hell be around.
We'll be seeing Gene McCarthy on TV soon. Hes signed up to do a 
series on Divorce Court. After that it will be solitude hopefully. The 
darling of the New Left has got the political savoir faire of Spiro Agnew. 
Smart enough, just not cunning enough. I hope he decides to form anoth
er party for the 1972 elections. It'll help split up the lunatic vote. Mc
Carthy will have to find a new issue to stimulate the voters. How about 
something really novel. Gene, like lets get our troops out of Fort Benning.
Next-Ted Kennedy ialias Ted Sorenson). It's difficult to talk ab
out the dead-politidally and otherwise-in a negative light. I just hope the 
nation is through with its Kennedy-cult worship. They're as mortal as 
you and I, just a hell of a lot richer. Nothing need be said about Teddys 
demonstrated fitness to be President.
What about George McGovern? Hes the ace Senator from North 
Dakota, or is it South Dakota? No matter, just know its a big state and 
hes a big man ini it. Uncle George is concerned about hungry Ameri
ca. In fact, he's one of the foremost experts on that topic. Maybe we 
should let him run Skibo. Being a Democrat he should feel right at home 
with deficit spending there.
Dramatically, I've saved the best for last. That, of course, is the 
grandiloquent gradulist Abbie Hoffman. This efficient leader of the 
Youth International Party seems to be the man respectable liberalism 
can turn to. Martyred saint of Chicago, expert on far east affairs, model 
of deportment, organizer non-pareil, Abbie has all the necessary attri
butes of Presidential material. Besides, he has an added virtue, cru
cial to these anxious times. He has the ability to laugh at himself. But 
that is such a full time job he mav never see the insides of the White 
House. TILL THE PAUCITY OF QUALIFIED LIBERAL LEADERS MA' 
POWERS OF THE Left will have to prevail upon Abbie-for the good of the 
country. Just keep your eye on meteoric Abbie.

by CHUCK DALY
In the first of its scheduled 
lectures by famous personages, 
the Activities Council featured 
NBC newsman Sander Vanocur 
speaking on the politics of the 
sixties. Mr. Vanocur typified 
this decade as a period 
where the winner became the 
losers and the losers became the 
winners.
This decade began as a decade 
of hope ... I think it will end 
as a decade of doubt, stated Van
ocur, citing the question of 
whether political institutions can 
keep up with technological pro
gress.
Mr. Vanocur thenproceeded to 
give a commentary on the 
history of politics in the past de
cade, concluding that the poli
tics of the future will be typi
fied by the politics of confronta
tion. He gave Chicago as the 
turning point in American poli
tics. The political observers did 
not realize the power of the

youth movement until that inci
dent. Vanocur forecasts trouble for 
Nixon in 1972, since they will be 
carrying the politics of the six
ties into the seventies. He sees 
either McGovern or Muskie as 
the Democratic standard bearer 
for 1972.
At the luncheon following the 
lecture, Vanocur commented in 
depth on some of the issues of 
relevant to students today. We 
have a youth oriented society to
day, he stated. The youth will 
only become a much bigger force 
in this country.
With regard to subjective 
journalism, Mr. Vanocur stated 
that people want the interpreta
tion and the opinion. Raw facts 
can add up to one big liek he 
continued. Commentary gets 
a much bigger reaction. Tied 
with this, Vanocur quoted NBC 
newsman David Brinkley: The 
news is whatever I say it is.
In future lectures the Activi
ties Council will feature Arthur 
Schlesinger Jr., Strom Thurmond. 
William Moorhead, and a num
ber of other notables.

COMPLAINT
To The Honorable, The Judges of 
Said Court:
Carnegie-Mellon University. 
Plaintiff above named, com
plains of the Defendants and
says:
1. Plaintiff is a private Uni
versity organized and existing as 
a Corporation under the laws of 
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl
vania and has its principal of
fice at 711 Forbes Avenue, City 
of Pittsburgh, County of Allegh
eny, Pittsburgh.
2. Defendant, Frank Morra, Jr., 
is an individual residing at 5507 
Howe Street, Pittsburgh, Penn
sylvania 15232 and is presently 
a student at Carnegie-Mellon 
University.
3.Defendant, David Caney, is an 
individual residing at 641 Mary
land Avenue, Pittsburgh Pennsyl
vania 15232 and is presently a 
student at Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity.
4. Defendant, David Schwartz, 
is an individual residing at 641 
Maryland Avenue, Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania and is presently a 
student at Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versity.
5. Defendants, Frank Morra, 
Jr.. David Caney and David Sch
wartz and persons acting in con
cert with or in behalf of them 
are all joined as defendants here
in and are referred to as student 
defendants.
6. Plaintiff further joins as 
defendants certain persons, pres
ently unknown, who are employed 
as construction workers in and 
about the Research-Computer 
Building, which is presently un
der construction in the campus of 
Plaintiff. These defendants are 
hereinafter referred to as con
struction worker and defendants.
7. At about 11:30 a.m. on Sep
tember 23, 1969, defendants Frank 
Morra, Jr.. David Caney, David 
Schwartz, and other stu
dent defendants placed themselves 
on various roadways leading to 
the construction site of the Research-Computer Building for the 
purpose of blocking traffic into 
and out of such construction site 
so as to force the shutdown of 
construction. For a period of 
approximately two to three hours, 
the defendants substantially 
blocked traffic to and from this 
construction site and thereby ser
iously interferred with the 
work in process. These defendants 
have threatened to continue to in
terrupt traffic into and out of 
this construction site.
8. The foregoing conduct is in 
violation of the regulations re
garding demonstrations promul
gated in Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sitys Student Handbook  1969, 
page 35, as follows:
Richts of Assembly, Experssion 
and Academic Freedom
CMU recognizes the right and 
privilege of all students to ex
ercise the constitutional guaran
tees of free assembly and expres
sion. As a university sincerely 
espousing the philosophy of 
academic freedom, CMU urges 
and supports its students desires 
and efforts to pursue these rights.
In instances where students 
wish to use these rights throug 
protest or demonstration the rights 
and privileges of others must be 
considered. Thus,
1. The protest or demonstration 
must be of an orderly nature so 
that no acts of force or violence 
shall occur and the normal or
derly operation of the university 
will not be impeded.
2. The protest or demonstra
tion shall not infringe upon the 
rights or privileges or students 
not in sympathy with it. Thus, all 
students are assured that the idea 
or desires of others shall not be 
inflicted upon them and that they 
will be allowed to exercise the 
right of free choice.
3. Finally, the freedom to de
monstrate on the campus shall be 
limited to members of the cam
pus community only.
9. The aforementioned con
duct constitutes a tresspass that is 
continuous in nature and deprives 
plaintiff and others seeking en
try to the premises with the per
mission of plaintiff from enter
ing thereon.
10. During the course of the ac
tion of t? e student defendants de
scribed above, the construction 
worker defendants threatened 
to inflict serious bodily harm up
on the student defendants, un
less they permitted traffic to flow 
in and out of the construction 
site.
11. By reason of the aforesaid 
unlawful acts. Plaintiff has suf
fered, and will continue to suffer 
immediate and irreparable injyry, 
loss and damage to its property 
unless a temporary injunction is 
issued herein, and it will be im
possible to collect from the De
pendents the damages caused by 
them; Plaintiff is without an ade
quate remedy at law; as to each 
item or relief prayed for, greater 
injury will be inflicted upon the 
Plaintiff by the denial than by 
the grantihg of relief; and the 
continued illegal and unlawful 
conduct and acts and threatened 
course of action of the defend
ants ans other associated and 
participating with them have made 
it impossible for the Plaintiff to 
protect, preserve, obtain and en
force its rights, and have created 
an emergency of such a grave and 
serious nature as to require the 
issuance forthwith of a tem
porary restraining order; as a 
direct result of all of the fore
going acts of Defendant, Plain
tiff has suffered injury, loss and 
damage to its property.
The Carnegie-Mellon Universith Dames will hold their 
introductory coffee on Sunday, 
October 12 at 2.00 p.m. in the 
Wherrett Room of Skibo. All 
wives of students and all mar
ried women are invited. A brief 
history of the Dames will be 
given by one of the sponsors, 
Mrs. Kenneth Burchard; she 
will be followed by Mrs. Gil
bert Love, the guest speaker. 
After the brief meeting, re
freshments will be served.
Monthly meetings are held
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays:
1. That, after due notice and 
hearing, this Court issue a pre
liminary injunction, to be made 
permanent upon final hearing, 
restraining and enjoining stu
dent defendants, and each of 
them, and all other persons ac
ting in concert with them or in 
their behalf from:
a. In any manner unlawfully 
impeding, obstructing, hamper
ing or interfering with the bus
iness of the said Plaintiff;
b. Preventing or attei oting to 
prevent by any species of intimi
dation, threats, force, ccercion, 
obstruction or turning aside 
against his will, any of Plaintiffs 
students, agents, employees, re
presentatives and others having 
business with said Plaintiff, from 
entering, leaving and transac
ting business at Plaintiffs prop
erty;
c. Demonstrating, other than 
peacefully, and in accordance 
with the Carnegie-Mellon Uni
versitys Student Handbook  
1969, and unlawfully interfering 
with the ingress to or egress from 
Plaintiffs property;
2. That if student defendants, 
or any of them, or any person ac
ting in concert with them, shall 
choose to picket for any law
ful purpose, then:
a. The number of pickets at any 
entrance of the Plaintiffs pre
mises shall be restricted to five
(5) in number; and
b. The pickets shall remain in 
motion spaced at least ten feet 
apart; and
3. That construction employees 
and all persons acting in con
cert with them shall be restrain
ed and enjoined from in any way 
intimidating, coercing, or physi
cally harming any students, in
cluding student defendants and 
others acting in concert with 
them, from exercising their rights 
of free assembly as set forth in 
the above terms prescribing cer
tain activities of student de
fendants.
4. That Plaintiff be granted 
such other and futher relief as 
the case may require and as 
the Court shall deem proper, 
and the Plaintiff will ever re
spectfully pray, etc.
