Campus Chest Contest 
Challenge From Pitt
Last week the student body of the University of Pittsburgh 
challenged the student body of Carnegie Tech to direct competition 
in the annual Campus Chest drives to be held on the two campuses 
during this month. ?-------------------------------------------*---------
Spring Carnivals popular production has devised a new ar
rangement for its previously cramped stage. The amphitheatre 
pattern increases the seating capacity and doesnt require as large 
an orchestra.
Scotch Vi Soda Plans 
Unique Stage Design
This year, as the signs around campus have indicated, Scotch and 
Soda will be done in-the-round. This means that for the first time 
the audience at the Spring Carnival musical will surround the play
ers. The stage is a circular platform in the center of a group of 
 ^raised tiers of seats. The actors
enter and leave on the aisles; the 
orchestra is located by the side of
Following is the letter received 
from Robert Sedler, president of 
the Pitt Student Congress and Cy 
Kylander, chairman of the Pitt 
Chest:
Student Congress, representing 
the student body at the University
o f Pittsburgh, 
challenges the 
student bodies 
at Carnegie 
Tech and Duquesne to direct 
competition i n 
our respective 
student Chest 
Drives this coming month.
Our challenge is based upon the 
following points:
1.) We assert that the full-time 
members of undergraduate and 
graduate schools at the University 
of Pittsburgh will give a larger 
average contribution to the Pitt 
Chest Drive than students at either 
Carnegie Tech or Duquesne will 
give to their respective campaigns.
2.) We believe moreover, that 
we will have a larger percentage 
of our students giving to Pitt Chest 
than either Tech or Duquesne will 
have contributing to their respec
tive drives. . . .
On the two points outlined 
above, we think we have you beat. 
But we do wish you the best of 
luck in your campaign.
The Tech Student Council and 
the 1955 Campus Chest Organiza
tion, headed by Janet Bishop, 
vice-president of Student Council, 
have accepted Pitts challenge in a 
letter written to them last week. 
From now on, it is up to the Tech 
student body to disprove the Pitt 
theory of supremacy.
Campus Chest is an annual unit
ed drive conducted on the Tech 
campus. It is designed to replace 
all other charity campaigns and to 
solicit at one time the contri
butions each student would un
doubtedly give during a year to 
various social service, medical, re
lief, and student welfare agencies. 
The Tech drive this year is sched
uled to begin November 14 and 
extend through November 21. Ex
tensive plans have been underway 
since the end of September for a 
program of personal-solicitation 
whereby students shall be solicited 
individually on the basis of their 
place of residence. This is a new 
approach in contrast to last years 
drive which based its solicitations 
program on classroom appeals.
Accident Policies
Accident policies paid for at 
registration are now in the 
office of the Registrar. Stu
dents should secure their pol
icies promptly.
Quartets
Students and faculty mem
bers who are interested in 
organizing barbershop quar
tets, composed of first and sec
ond tenors, baritones and 
bassos, are invited to attend 
a meeting in the Exhibition 
Room of Fine Arts at 8 p.m. 
on Wednesday, November 2.
Mr. Will Herberg 
Speaks At Next 
Religious Assembly
The next Tuesday Assembly 
will feature Mr. Will Herberg, 
an outstanding young Jewish 
writer and lecturer from New 
York City. He will address the 
Assembly at 11:30 a.m., Novem
ber 8, in the Fine Arts Theatre. 
The Assembly program will end 
promptly at 12:25 p.m. The title 
of his speech is Anxiety, Faith, 
and the Courage to Be.
An added feature of this As
sembly program is that Mr. Her
berg will remain on the campus 
for two days following his ad
dress. He is scheduled to speak 
to several classes, to the Hillel 
Foundation, and to the denomina
tional chaplains at Carnegie 
Tech. It is also planned that he 
will lead discussions in several 
living units on the campus. Mr. 
Herberg will be available for 
private consultation, appoint
ments for which should be made 
with the office of Religious Af
fairs in Carnegie Union.
Mr. Herberg is well known for 
his work in two fieldssocial re
search and theology. He has 
served as research analyst for a 
large AF of L labor union. In re
cent years, his major concern has 
been theology and social philoso
phy. He has lectured and con
ducted seminars at leading aca
demic institutions.
Mr. Herberg is perhaps best 
known for his writings on politi
cal, social, and religious subjects. 
His most recent book, ProtestantCatholic-Jew: An Essay in Amer
ican Religious Sociology, was pub
lished last month and has met with 
vide acclaim. The New York Times 
Book Review stated that this book 
is the most fascinating essay on re
ligious sociology of America that 
has appeared in decades.
Rev. M. A. Thomas 
To Visit Carnegie 
This Weekend
Rev. M. A. Thomas from Travancore, India, will visit Tech this 
weekend. Sunday dinner at 1:15 in 
the Morewood Gardens Blue Room 
is open to the entire Tech commu
nity, students, faculty, and wives, 
to hear Mr. Thomas discuss 
World Revolution. Tickets for the 
dinner are available before No
vember 3 in the Office of Reli
gious Affairs in Carnegie Union, 
also on each floor of the mens 
dormitories, in Morewood Gardens 
and in each of the denominational 
student fellowships and the YMCA 
and YWCA.
The Breakfast Club of the First 
Baptist Church, held at 9:45 Sun
day moi*ning, offers students a 
chance to meet Mr. Thomas in
formally. Reservations should be 
made with Loretta Dyer by Fri
day at Ha. 1-7821.
 The Samovar Club, city-wide 
club for international students 
will honor Mr. Thomas as a guest 
at their Sunday evening meet
ing at 6:30 p.m. at the YWCA at 
405 S. Dithridge Street
Scot
The Scot, widely believed 
in the best-informed circles to 
be going on sale November 2, 
will actually not be available 
until Wednesday, November 9.
Many Worthwhile 
Agencies Receive 
Of Campus Chest
Following a precedent estab
lished by many American colleges 
and universities, Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology instituted the 
Campus Chest on the Tech campus 
in the fall of 1949. Since then the 
drive has been an annual means 
to solicit contributions from the 
student body.
This is the first in a series of 
articles describing the agencies to 
which the Advisory Board of the 
Tech Campus Chest has proposed 
allocation of total funds raised.
The social service agencies to 
which funds will be allocated from 
the 1955 Campus Chest include: 
Salvation Army: The Salvation 
Army is a partially-supported 
service organization which is on 
twenty-four hour duty. It gives 
assistance in areas of family serv
ice, summer camps for children, 
medical and dental care, and can
teen and recreation service for 
Armed Service-men. Five percent 
of the total funds raised will go to 
the Salvation Army.
Allegheny County Community 
Chest: The Community Chest rep
resents 67 individual charitable or
ganizations servicing Allegheny 
County, of which Pittsburgh rep
resents a major area. These in
clude organizations devoted to 
child welfare, e.g., Boy Scouts, 
Girl Scouts, the YM and YWCA, 
and community organizations 
which promote community serv
ices. Twenty percent of the Tech 
funds will go to this agency.

Student Recital 
By Phi Mu Alpl la
Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia will pre
sent a student recital tonight in 
the Exhibition Room, College of 
Fine Arts, at 8:30 p.m. The pro
gram will include: Corellis Ada
gio, transcribed by Schuster; Schu
manns Fantasy Pieces, Opus 73, 
with Irene Schall, cello, and JoAnn Relf, piano; and Brahms 
Sonata in F Minor, Opus five, with 
Richard Osiier at the piano.
Phi Mu Alpha, a national music 
honor fraternity, is guided by the 
following purposes: to promote
music in America, to foster mutual 
welfare of brotherhood, to inspire 
loyalty to the Alma Mater, and 
to advance the cause of music.
This recital is one of seven which 
will be presented throughout the 
school year by Phi Mu Alpha. 
Other events scheduled include the 
freshmen reception for music stu
dents, a Christmas party, a depart
ment picnic, and the presentation 
of the Burton Riest Memorial Tro
phy to the outstanding senior 
from Phi Mu Alpha.
Students, faculty, and guests are 
cordially invited to the recital.
best to confuse both visitors and 
students. The biggest attraction 
for the students, nevertheless, ap
peared to be the visitors. Many of 
the guides were so impressed by 
the strange equipment on cam
pus that they were willing to give 
guided tours to individuals rather 
than to a group.
As usual, the evening was full 
of appropriate comments to the 
various situations. One observer 
was quite impressed by the look 
of dismay on the faces of several 
printers when a cute young thing 
desired to, see some printing 
at 10:16 p.m. In the Fine Arts 
building, several engineers were 
infatuated with the enunciation of 
a guide when she gave a dis
course on what the ahts had on 
display. They immediately went 
off on a fruitless search for pos
ing nudes.
The glass blowing exhibition in 
the physics department was a 
real treat. It seems that this oc;

the stage.
The performers had previously 
been cramped for space on the 
small gym stage, and because of 
the necessity for having a certain 
number of seats in the house, 
many viewers were forced to sit 
very far from the stage. The or
chestra located in front of the 
stage and without a pit, often 
nearly blasted the first few rows 
of people out onto the Fine Arls 
lawn.
Audience Closer
The use of the theater-in-theround will bring the audience into 
more intimate contact with the 
entire production. To seat a large 
number of people will be consid
erably easier, since no one will be 
too far away from the show. Be
cause of this intimate set-up, only 
a small orchestra will be required 
to supply a background for the 
central singers and dancers. Again, 
because of its very nature, there is 
no need for elaborate, hard-toconstruct and hard-to-handle sets. 
The sets consist of suggestive 
pieces that create a mood with 
the lighting. The aisles can be used 
for the chorus of an incidental mu
sical number with a few people. 
Every square inch of space is used 
the aisles, the central stage, the 
orchestra space, the audience area 
and the theater become one tight 
compact unit.
With the elimination of clumsy 
sets and a large orchestra and with 
the audience closely and intimate
ly in contact with the audience, 
Scotch and Soda this year will try 
to put on a sparkling, fast-moving 
revue, with a variety of skits and 
musical numbers ranging from 
satirical bites to low-down, washed-down, knocked-down blues.

Campus Swamped With Curious 
At Last Tuesdays Open House
By Bob Jack
If, on last Tuesday evening you were jostled out of your normal 
routine by a host of inquisitive teen-agers, you can blame it all on 
the annual Open House. There seemed to be few offices or crannies 
even in Porter Hallthat escaped this curious mob. However, most
?departments came through with 
an admirable display of gadgets 
and exhibitions which did their

Carnegie *08 Class 
Visit Alma Mater; 
Reminisce Changes
Thirty members of the class of 
1908 met on October 21, 1955, in 
Room 100 of Porter Hall. It is the 
same room in which they regis
tered as freshmen on October 16, 
1905 in what was then the Car
negie Technical Schools. The 
newly-modernized lecture room 
was quite different from what 
they remembered. In 1905 Room 
100 had carbon-incandescent and 
arc lights and hard chairs.
These members of the first 
graduating class at Carnegie 
Tech got their sheepskins in three 
years by going to college seven 
days a week. In 1908 they re
ceived certificates .of graduation 
but no degree. Many, like Pro
fessor Arthur Gittins, now teach
ing metallurgy at Pitt, returned 
several years later to win de
grees. Their tuition was $40 a 
year. But dont forget, engi
neers bemoaning your lot, for 
your $680 tuition you get the 
benefit of modern laboratories 
and the knowledge of the atomic 
and electronic era.
The old grads recalled that 
around 1905 a favorite pastime 
was whitewashing the statue of 
Edward M. Bigelow on the cam
pus. Another time when Tech 
beer was first brought out, stu
dents ripped down an advertising 
sign because they felt the desig
nation Tech belonged to their 
school.
Joseph S. Wilson of Los An
geles, who retired after 40 years 
with Armco Steel Co., recalled 
that on his first job out of col
lege he worked 13 hours a night 
and was paid $56 a month. Most 
of the graduates worked 10 hours 
a day for a dime an hour, a dol
lar a day, he remembered. To
days Tech engineering grads 
start at $400 a month.
Also on hand was Willibald C. 
L. Trinks, professor of mechani
cal engineering emeritus and an 
authority on rolling mills, who 
taught the class of 1908.

Robert Casadesus 
At Syria Mosque
Robert Casadesus, a perennial 
giant of the piano keyboard, re
turns to Pittsburgh this weekend 
as guest soloist with the Pitts
burgh Symphony Orchestra in 
two concerts, Friday evening and 
Sunday afternoon, November 4 
and 6, at Syria Mosque. With Wil
liam Steinberg conducting, he 
will play two Mozart concertos, 
No. 27 in B-flat Major and No. 26 
in D Major (Coronation). The 
double Mozart treat is planned 
as part of the bicentennial cele
bration of that composers birth.
Rounding out the program will 
be two contemporary orchestral 
works, Hindemiths Concert Mu
sic for Brass and Strings and 
Luigi Dallapiccolas Due Pezzi 
per Orchestra.
To music lovers everywhere the 
name Casadesus means music with 
a capital M. Noted for his in
terpretations of Mozart, his per
formances with the Pittsburgh 
Symphony this weekend should 
prove especially rewarding to local 
audiences.
Spirited Artists 
Of Tech, W & J 
Demonstrate Skills
The seed of school spirit burst 
into full bloom last Tuesday night 
when approximately 18 Tech stu
dents staged a commando raid on 
Washington & Jefferson. Silently 
slipping into the quiet town of 
Washington, Pa., the Techites 
limed old College Field with the 
initials CIT, painted the field 
house walls with such slogans as 
Tech Beat W & J, and did a 
Rembrant of the same slogan on 
approximately 100 feet of side 
walk in front of the administration 
building. They also commandeered 
a Welcome Alumni banner from 
the center of town before zooming 
away unseen and unheard.
On Wednesday, the Prexies re
taliated with 40 men attempting to 
paint W & J Beat Tech on the 
Oakland campus. Caught in the 
act, the Prexies took to the woods 
of Schenley Park on foot and in 
automobiles. A hearty chase took 
place with a carload of men finally 
being trapped in a dead-end street 
beside Carnegie Museum. The six 
men were immediately hustled to
A Contrast
By Joseph A. Szewc
Five boys dressed like normal 
American college students sat in 
dead-panned silence. They had 
the look of doomed men, for these 
men were the captives.
The crowd which stood before 
them elbowed each other slyly 
and laughed devilishly. These men 
were the headhunters.
A sixth captive was brought 
into the room followed by a redhaired, grinning Irishman, who 
was dressed in a white frock and 
brandished a pair of scissors. The 
men looked at the captive critically 
and then cheered the Irishmans 
handiwork with a gusto seldom 
heard. The five despondents 
groaned sickeningly. A large CT 
had been, shaved in the new ar
rivals head. The hairdo was the 
order of the day and the guards 
squealed with delight.
The next victim looked plead
ingly at his abductors and mum
bled he had a date coming from 
New York. The headhunters sigh
ed sympathetically. Slowly his hair 
fell to the floor as everything but 
a large, hairy T was cut off. 
The revelry continued into the 
night with the laughter growing 
and the hair falling.
This is American college life. 
Its pretty wonderful that we can 
enjoy these stunts with abandon
ment and a feeling of security. 
The captives lost their hair and 
worried about their Homecoming 
dates. But did you know that
20,000 Japanese students suffering 
from tuberculosis worry about 
their lives and not about girls? 
Three thousand Calcutta Univer
sity students have no home let 
alone a Homecoming.
These and many other students 
in foreign lands are aided when 
you give to the Campus Chest. 
They need a helping hand, not a 
hair cut. Support the Campus 
Chest.

few remaining men in the pro
fession. The civil engineers had 
an electronic weighing device 
which was operated by a suitably 
disinterested student who inter
preted the bouncing green line 
on an oscilloscope to the dissat

electrical engineers came through 
with a timely power failure, 
which left some of their displays 
inoperative. The evening would

equally bored instructors. Then 
there were the high school cats

through in the shortest possible 
time. The girls just acted dumb

by musty old halls, 1900 vintage 
light fixtures, and the lethargy of 
the co-eds they could observe.

make the evening a profitable 
one, both for prospective students 
and those students who wanted 
to see what goes on in the

Tartans Take 4th Straight; 
Roll Over Prexies, 16-0
By Jim Lacey
For the second straight week the Carnegie Tech Tartans played 
before a homecoming crowd. But this week they were guests of 
Washington and Jefferson, and they were a mean bunch of guests 
at that as they handed the Presidents a 16-0 defeat on a rain drenched
field. ?----------------------------------------------------
Just before the game started the
rains came in torrents and made 
the field a greasy mass of mud. 
It also rained on the fraternities 
crepe-paper homecoming floats 
and dampened the queen and her 
court riding on one of the numer
ous floats.
Techs first break came midway 
in the second quarter as a high 
pass from center went sailing over 
Ed Grazzines head and rolled 
into the end zone. Here he dove 
on the ball, but Ken Ficery 
dropped on him giving Tech a 
safety.
The Tartans capitalized again 
when they traded an interception 
for a fumble. Tom Briner dropped 
on Ed Daglishs fumble giving 
Tech the ball on their own 32 yard 
line. From here Tech drove in 
four plays to the goal. The big 
play of the drive was a 22 yard 
run by freshman Walt Majeski 
froui his own 36 to the W & J 
42 yard marker. Then came a bit 
of irony when J. C. Les Bryant, 
from Washington, Pa., and a for
mer W & J student came into the 
game. He got a round of boos 
from his friends and promptly 
took a perfect pass from John 
Tucci to score a touchdown. Roy 
DeVries belted the ball through 
the uprights to give Tech a 9-0 
lead, which they held until half 
time.
2nd Half Duplicates 1st
In the second half, the Presi
dents changed from their mud 
covered jerseys to flashy red and 
black ones. This made no differ
ence to Tech who continued to 
hold them scoreless throughout 
the third period. The third period 
was almost a carbon copy of the 
first with neither team being able 
to make any appreciable gains, 
and both teams did a great deal 
of punting.
The fourth stanza went along
Volleyball
Regular play in the ,Co-Rec 
Volleyball ended in a flurry last 
week. League I ended in a three 
way tie between SAE-Commuters, 
DTD-Independents, and ObelisksDorm A. The excitement started 
last week on Thursday night. First 
the DTD-Independents topped un
defeated SAE-Commuters; then 
the SAE-Commuters bounced back 
to beat the undefeated ObelisksDorm A team. Playoffs between 
these three teams will be on Tues
day night with the first and second 
teams entering the interleague 
playoffs to be held the following 
Thursday night.
In League II, ATO-Dorm B end
ed the season undefeated by beat
ing PK-Chi Omega. This game put 
the ATO-Dorm B team in first 
place with the Phi Kap-Ghi Omega 
taking the second slot.
Due to preparations for Home
coming, only three games were 
played last week. The ObelisksDorm A defeated DU-KKG, ATODorm B defeated Beta-Tri Delts, 
and SAE-Commuters downed 
BSR-KAT.
As the season enters the playoffs, 
it looks like a fight between SAECommuters and Obelisks-Dorm A 
in League I, and between Phi KapChiOs and ATO-Dorm B in League
II.
in about the same fashion, until 
about two minutes of the game 
remained. Marshall Brown put the 
Prexies in the hole with a punt 
that rolled dead on their own 14. 
On the first play, Jack Seitz 
fumbled and DeVries recovered. 
After Brown banged through to 
the nine, Ace Adams stepped back 
and flipped a pass into the end 
zone and Don Hrosik made a 
diving catch for the final score. A 
bad center from the two yard line 
forced DeVries to run his con

In the Tartan League undefeat
ed DTD beat a tough PiKA team 
to take league honors. Although 
the PiKAs had the Delts worried 
when they pulled within one point 
of them in the third quarter, they 
were unable to cope with the 
Delts long passes which led to the 
final two tallies. The final score 
was DTD over PiKA 17-7.
Also within the playoffs for the 
Tartan League is the second place 
ATO (A) team who have been 
beaten only by the Delts. Earlier 
in the week TX beat the Obelisks, 
35-21, and PiKA topped Newman 
and TDP 17-13 and 11-1 respec
tively.
Undefeated KS, who finished 
their regularly scheduled season a 
week ago, is the champion in the 
Kiltie League. They will be ac
companied to the playoffs by sec

Kap (B) team Friday night to end 
their schedule with a 5 and 1 
record. Their single loss was 
several weeks ago at the hands of 
KS, 21-13. In the only other Kiltie 
League game last week, Phi Kap 
(B) beat BTP, 24-8.

lone possession of the league 
championship. .Phi Kap (A) has

The aforementioned organiza( 
tions frequently utilize the facil
ities of Carnegie Union for various 
business and social functions 
throughout the school year and 
can be a tremendous help in pro
curing a much needed item for 
the Union, a television set. Al
though no definite plans have been 
made for this project, a few ten
tative ones are listed below.
1) Each organization will estab
lish, at the discretion of the 
officers, a television fund com
mittee for the purpose of so
licitation of funds among the 
general membership. A mod
est sum of 50 cents per person 
has been proposed and all 
money collected will be turn
ed over to Mr. McKelway,
Evening School Registrar, foi* 
safe keeping.
2) A definite Kick-off date 
will be scheduled to inaugu
rate the fund raising project, j
3) The presidents of all the or* 
ganizations will assume the 
role of co-chairmen for the 
fund campaign.
4) Day school organizations, such 
as World University Service,
Newman Club, Citcom, and all 
other interested organizations 
on campus are expected to 
participate in this program.
5) A donor scroll will be ap
propriately placed in the Un

tributors.

WHATS
THIS?
EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE in the Droodle above (titled: 
Lucky smokers playing poker) has a good deal. Because 
they all smoke Luckies, they all enjoy better taste. 
Luckies taste better, first of all, because Lucky Strike 
means fine tobacco. Then that tobacco is toasted to taste 
even better . . . cleaner, fresher, smoother. So light up 
a Lucky yourself. Youll rate it aces high for smoking 
enjoyment. DROODLES, Copyright 1953 by Roger Price
