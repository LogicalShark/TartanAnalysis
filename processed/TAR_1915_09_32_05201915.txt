Pew of us have realized what good 
has been accomplished for Tech by 
the last gift of our Founder. The 
funds for this gift have been available 
for a long time, the first public an
nouncement, however, was made by 
President Church at our last Found
ers Day exercises.
With a part of the gift announced 
on Founder's Day an extension has 
been built to the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School; the Central Build
ing has been erected, and contracts 
have been let for the completion of 
the two wings of the School of Ap
plied Design, and for the tower ex
tension of the School of Applied In
dustries.
At this time, being the end of the 
tenth year since the first spade of 
earth was lifed for the campus of our 
present great Institution, it seems 
only natural and appropriate that we 
should look back upon the work done 
by our Director and Trustees, made 
possible by the gifts of our noble 
Founder, We all are acquainted with 
the buildings, their equipment, and 
we all realize how favorably we stand 
at the end of ten years, as compared 
to other schools many times older. 
These points hardly require further 
elaboration, but there are doubtless 
many facts and statistics concerning 
our Institution with which we are 
not so well acquainted and which 
may surprise us.
The total enrollment of the Insti
tution for the first ten years ending
1914-15, has been 12,465 different stu
dents, there being no duplications in 
these figures; of these 4,449 were day 
students and 8,016 night students; the 
registration this year exceeded 3,200. 
The total number of graduates is now
1,227. These figures alone amply 
justify a note of optimism.
It is also with interest that we note 
another fact which again shows upon 
what substantial foundations and 
principles we are founded. In defer
ence to the wishes of the Founder, 
the following action has been voted 
by the Executive Committee of the 
Carnegie Foundation:
Voted: That teachers in the Car
negie Institute of Technology shall 
be eligible to retiring allowances from 
the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching upon the 
same terms as teachers in the acceptContinued on Page 2
Tech came out the loser in the an
nual dual meet held at Forbes Field 
last Saturday afternoon but although 
the score was rather one-sided when 
totalled, in those events held Satur
day afternoon, Tech rolled up a score 
only slightly behind the total of their 
opponents who pulled ahead in the 
field events.
The weight events were held on 
Tech Field Friday afternoon in order 
that the turf at the baseball field 
should not be injured. Here Tech 
only took one second, Adams in the 
discuss, leaving the remainder of the 
team a handicap of 21 points with 
which to start Saturday. Techs lack 
of weight men was clearly in evidence 
at this occasion, which is all the 
more credit to Adams, who is com
pelled to hold up that end of the team 
almost alone.
The track at Forbes Field was in 
miserable condition, and is a poor 
thing at best for good running. There 
are four sharp turns, one almost di
rectly at right angles, and only a 
short straightaway for the finish in 
the distances. The condition of the 
track was costly to Pitt, as Burwell, 
the star sprinter, badly injured his 
ankle in the 220 and may be out for 
the remainder of the season.
Close finishes were in order, es
pecially in the distances. Rieser took 
two firsts as usual in the half and 
mile. In the latter, Ganto of Pitt set 
the pace much of the way and kept 
up to Rieser until the last bend, where 
the Tech star easily drew away and 
finished with a lead of ten yards. 
Moore and Andrews of Tech finished 
fourth and fifth. The latter is a new 
man and should be heard from next 
year, as he ran a good race in this his 
first. In the 880 Rieser was never 
passed and won easily. Cary and
Findlay of Tech finished fourth and 
fifth.
In the two-mile Dockstader and 
Grumbling fought it out the entire 
race, alternating in the lead. Dock
stader began his sprint a little too
soon, being only one-third the way
around the last quarter. He led
Grumbling till just before the tape 
where the latter passed, each fighting 
his hardest, and won by a yard. Each 
runner is a freshman in his school, 
so that there Will be some interesting 
contests in the future. Duen, a for
mer Tech man, and Handelman, of 
Tech, fough for fifth place.
Contrary to the expectations of 
Pitt, Blumenthal took first in both 
hurdles, winning easily. Meredith, of 
Tech, .who because of school work 
has been unable to train to a suffi
cient extent this year, took third in 
the low hurdles.
In the 100 Burwell, Pitts colored 
sprinter, was handicapped two yards 
for false starts. However, he ran .a 
beautiful race, passing Hemmann just 
at the tape. The grass track slowed 
up the time. In the 220 Hemmann 
won easily as Burwell turned his 
ankle and wrenched the ligaments of 
his leg, an old trouble from last year, 
and retired in the first 100 yards.
Tech had only two men entered in 
the quarter and each placed. Mc
Cracken finished strong as usual but 
is still weak on the start. Dunseith 
ran an excellent race.
In the field events Pitt won easily, 
due to the absence of Wright, who 
was disqualified because of low schol
astic standing. He will probably be 
able to compete, however, next Sat
urday.
In the track events Tech lead with 
a score of 37, Pitt having 35.
The complete summary follows:

The annual school picnic will be 
held at the farm, Camp Louise Car
negie, tomorrow. The train leaves 
Union Station at 1:30, East Liberty 
1:40, and leaves the farm at 8:00 P. M. 
Classes will be dismissed at 12:30. 
Round trip $1.00.
The announcement will probably 
cause sorrow to many, being an in
crease of 50 cents over last year. 
However, the P. R. R. has become in
different since the latest ruling of the 
Public Service Commission and re
fused to lower the rate one iota. As 
it is, the institution looses sixteen 
cents for each passenger, the railroad 
charging $1.16 round trip. The school 
has guaranteed one hundred tickets 
in order to obtain a special train.
Supper will be served by the bean
ery or may be taken by the picnicers. 
Milk and other farm products may be 
obtained at the camp. There is spring 
water in abundance.
Mr. McCullough is at present ar
ranging a program of land and water 
sports. Some thirty canoes will be 
on hand, the rivers offering an ex

of wielding the paddle.
For those not yet acquainted with 
Camp Carnegie, this most excellent 
chance should be taken. There are 
seven hundred and fifty acres along 
the Allegheny, with abundant groves 
and orchards, and a sixteen-room 
mansion house, besides several bung
alows.
There are several herds of prize 
goats and sheep as well as fancy cat

animals peculiar to farm life. Think

"CULTURE A REAL ASSET 
TO EVERY COLLEGE 
GRADUATE.
The average expect the college 
graduate to be a very learned man. 
He will, in his first years experience 
in the world, brush up against people 
who expect him to be well versed in 
everything, from kinematics to aes
thetics. He does not go forth known 
as a graduate in engineering, finance 
or art, but branded as a college man 
in the broad sense. It is well that 
those who will some day be leaving 
college realize this. Even those who 
expect to end their days in a con
struction camp may sometimes have 
to run the bluff of culture in a draw
ing room.
The man who comes to college 
with the idea of becoming an engi
neer, architect or expert has many 
opportunities of broadening the hu
manistic side of his nature as well. 
He does not have so many, to be 
sure, as the academic student, but 
even these neglect their opportuni
ties and are often turned out upon 
the world as uncouth as when they 
entered. In the main, it may be said 
that the amount of cultureso essen
tial in modern cosmopolitan society 
that one attains is the result of the 
mans own application of himself, and 
not of lecture hall work. 
Opportunities along this line are 
being offered to the students of Car
negie at all times. The Academy of 
Science and Art hold a series of most 
instructive and entertaining lectures 
in Carnegie Lecture Hall, dealing 
with music drama, engineering, archi
tecture and art. Also Carnegie Music 
Hall offers many travelogues and 
concerts.
Our own school in its General 
Lectures, gives us a wonderful chance 
to broaden. The Economic Society 
lately has been bringing many noted 
speakers, but we are sorry to say that 
they lack the necessary support of 
our student body. Revivals of the 
old dramas take place in our Design 
Theatre, let alone the various pa
geants given in that school.
A knowledge of drama and other 
arts will not help a man make dollars 
and cents, but it will do a bigger thing 
for him. It will enable him to go 
into the world capable of meeting all 
classes of people on an equal footingmg.
FORGET IT.
The editorials of college publica
tions are now full of this sort of com
ment:
Fellow students, forget it. The 
way may be a little long and laborious 
for some of you, but the brain that 
does nothing but brood about it, is 
dangerously open to infection by the 
germs of that disease commonly 
known as spring fever. You may be 
weary, but you will see many a wear
ier day, after you have gotten out 
into life and are fighting your own 
battles, and there will be a lifetime of 
years instead of a few weeks between 
you and vacation.
Yes, forget it. You may be weary; 
but, all in all, your lot is blessed com
pared with the lot of the average man 
of the world, so blessed, indeed, that 
it is a sin to complain.
Forget your petty troubles, we 
say; forget them.
NOTICE!
Socks Price, entitling himself 
The Student Merchant, has an
nounced that he is an aspirant for 
the motorcycle offered by the Liggett 
& Myers Tobacco Company. So far, 
so good, Mr. Price being a registered 
student of this Institution. But when 
the person under discussion also an
nounces privately that he will sell his 
votes to a Pitt contestant, provided 
that the other Tech man does not bid 
high enough, we feel that the com
mercial and moral sense, the spirit 
and the nerve displayed in this as
tounding statement does not merit 
the support of the students of this 
Institution. We hope that the stu
dent body will approve of our stand.

The Sigma Taus spent a very pleas
ant afternoon and evening, near Oakmont on Saturday, May 15th, enter
taining with a picnic. About fifteen 
couples were in attendance and all 
voted the day a huge success.
The Beta Theta Epsilon fraternity 
spent a most enjoyable evening on 
Saturday, May 15th, entertaining with 
a smoker. The pleasure of the even
ing was to no small measure due to 
the music and refreshments.
The Sigma Rho fraternity entertamed many friends at a tea on Fri
day afternoon, May 14th. Everybody 
agreed that their new house leaves 
little to be desired. During the even
ing an impromptu dance was given, 
which was chaperoned by Mrs. Crab
tree and Mrs. Slocum. On Saturday 
evening their annual meeting of 
Alumni and active members took 
place, about fifty members being pres
ent.
The Xi Sigma Upsilon fraternity 
was the scene of a merry house party 
during the last week-end. Judging 
from the fair young ladies present, 
we would say, without hesitation, that 
it must have been a gay and success
ful party.

with the approval of our readers, and

in announcements, we will be only 
too glad to correct such errors, as may

REVIEW OF FIRST DECADE
Continued from Page 1 
ed institutions. Such retiring allow
ances will be voted by the Executive 
Committee of the Foundation in each 
case upon the recommendation of the 
Trustees and Director of the Car
negie Institute of Technology. This 
action applies to teachers in all four 
schools of the Institute.
In the Design School a fellowship 
known as the C. Russell Hewlett Me
morial has successfully been estab
lished. Together with the action of 
the Trustees in appropriating a sum 
of money for this purpose, it has had 
liberal gifts from his family, friends 
and students, and now assures an an
nual income of not less than four 
hundred dollars. Also a collection 
known as the Hewlett collection will 
be of great educational value to the 
Design School. The first prize of any 
amount offered to a student in the 
Department of Painting is now avail
able. Through the kindness of Mr. 
Joel W. Burdick a prize of two hun
dred dollars is to be awarded this 
year for a scholarship in this depart
ment.
We may also well take notice of the 
successful efforts of our Bureau of 
Recommendation, which has done 
much to aid the student. The efforts 
of this department are most highly 
appreciated by the student body. Dur
ing the year 1914-15 676 students se
cured employment through this 
means, aggregating an approximate 
earning of $165,700. This surely 
shows good work considering also, 
that the year is not as yet concluded 
and especially inasmuch as business 
conditions have been, and are at pres
ent, at a low ebb.
The lecture courses inaugurated 
last year, by means of which the in
fluence of the Institution has been 
considerably broadened, has met with 
much success and approval. The two 
fold object of this extension work 
has been to render service' to a larger 
community, to popularize education 
to those whom it may not reach in 
any other way, and secondly, to bring 
the faculty in closer contact with the 
community. The approximate total 
audience addressed by those lectures 
is to date about twenty thousand.
These are a few facts which show 
our advancement and what is being 
done toward the promotion of our 
Founders ideal, An Institution sel
dom equalled, never excelled.

All the Money You Need?
Would you go a step out of 
your way to make $5.00 or $10 
or even $1 5.00? 
Would you scorn the oppor

saving it? 
All these are questions a man 
must put to himself and answer 
logically and forcefully. 
If you study the history of the

that they have never scorned the

TRACK CHAMPIONSHIP WILL 
BE DECIDED SATURDAY.
State, Pitt, and Tech Are Likely Con
tenders in Annual Intercol
legiate Meet.
The annual intercollegiate track 
meet held under the auspices of the 
University of Pittsburgh is on the 
program for Saturday, when the 
championship of this end of the state 
will be decided. The entries include 
Penn State, Pitt, W. & J., Westmin
ster, Carnegie and several other col
leges of Western Pennsylvania.
Because of its well balanced team, 
State again looms up as the probable 
winner, while Pitt and Tech will like
ly finish second and third as they did 
last year. Pitt will be weakened by 
the loss of Burwell, and our team 
lacks field and weight men, although 
the presence of Hal Wright in the 
pole vault and high jump should ma
terially help our score.
In conjunction with the intercol
legiate meet the prep schools of this 
and nearby vicinities will contest for 
interscholastic honors. The meet will 
be held as usual on Schenley Oval 
and will start promptly at 1 oclock, 
the college and school athletes alter
nating with their events. No admis
sion fee will be charged.
TENNIS COURT MONOPOLIES.
There is, probably, here at Tech 
no form of recreation which is more 
popular than tennis, and it was be
cause of this, that the schools have 
established five new courts near the 
Design School. Since the comple
tion of these courts, however, only a 
very small percentage of the student 
body has been able to take advantage 
of them owing to the fact that a cer
tain few students, who are taking 
some of the more leisurely courses 
have seen fit to monopolize the 
courts. One student was heard to 
brag last week, that by getting over 
to the courts at seven-thirty, he and 
his partner were able to keep the 
court nearly all morning, during 
which time they played nine sets of 
singles. This student was evidently 
not aware that during this time he 
was excluding many other students 
who have just as much right to the 
courts as he had. Nevertheless, such 
was the case and as some students
seem unable to judge for themselves 
when they have used the courts their 
share of the time, it would be a good 
plan for the schools to hire some 
mentally competent individual who 
would be given charge of the courts, 
and who could see to it that none of 
the students monopolize the courts 
as has happened in the past, and is 
happening at the present.
SPORTING NOTES.
Word has been received from Monongahela High that Hill, winner of 
the mile and 880 yard run in the In
terscholastic meet week before last 
had been disqualified. This, of course, 
necessitates the return of his medals 
which will be sent to Cody of Shaw 
High School. Second, third and 
fourth men will likewise progress up 
one place.
Once more with the kind assistance 
of the sporting editor of the Chron
icle Telegraph has some Pitt student 
gotten in a sarcastic dig at the forg
ing and bricklaying departments in 
the Industrial School. He can only 
suppose that the student in question 
who continually goes so far out of 
his way to publish deliberately false 
inferences as to the make-up of our 
athletic teams is one of those large 
numbers of prep students who flunk 
their entrance exams, at Tech and 
then enter Pitt with advance stand
ing, or who flunk out here during their 
course and then enter at Pitt and 
graduate without loosing a semester.
Rumors are heard continually con
cerning various athletes to enter here 
next year. Lets hope they are true 
and meanwhile everyone mention it in 
their prayers this summer. A couple 
of weight men and jumpers would 
certainly be appreciated by Coach 
Dull, while our needs as to baseball 
are also being keenly felt at present.
The training house squirrel may be 
seen at any time holding the training 
house cat in its arms. Whos a na
ture fakir?
The 15-13 set in the tennis match 
Saturday had the small crowd of spec
tators on edge. There was some fine 
tennis displayed by both teams.
It is heard at the training house 
that a new organization will spring 
into the limelight known as the Dark 
Horse A. C. A team will be entered 
in the Crafton meet and expects to 
walk away with the relay. Applicants 
for membership with the initiation fee 
in their pocket should see Mitchell or 
Kelley.
Pitts chances in the interscholastic 
meet next Saturday received a blow 
in the loss of Burwell at the PittTech Dual. The colored sprinter had 
been showing fine form.
The State game was a hard one to 
loose but Pitt received a worse defeat 
than we did.
Tech should pull second next Sat
urday, State taking first. State and 
W. & J. will hold Pitt down in the 
field events. The relay will be very 
close.
At Lehigh the honor system is gov
erned by 14 students who have full 
control of student discipline.
Of the nineteen fraternities at Co
lumbia only seven have lived up to 
the interfraternity agreement drawn 
up last May. Unless action is taken 
the faculty will bar the pledging and 
initiation of new men until after a 
certain time limit.

It is the intention of the girls to give 
the play out-of-doors in Schenley 
Park. The story is an old Greek one 
and deals with the love of Thesta, a 
nymph, and Anchises, which flows 
smoothly along till Venus, the Queen 
of Love, comes and woos Anchises 
away. Thesta, jealous, calls down the 
wrath of Zens, and he, unable to harm 
Venus, being &n immortal, strikes 
Anchises blind. Venus is summoned 
to high Olympus by Zeus, and Thesta 
takes Anchises and promises to show 
him the world through her eyes.
There are several dances being ar
ranged for, the cast is working hard 
under the direction of Mr. Charles 
Meredith, and all promises well. How
ever, what is needed to make the play 
a success is the co-operation of all 
the girlsnot only the Junior class, 
but the whole school. All are invited 
to come. There will be no admission 
charged. The cast is as follows:
Thesta ........................Constance Stout
Anchises ........................Marion Pichel
Venus ......................Marguerite Menges
Silenus ...........................Ruth Pontius
Coila ..........................Charlotte Watson
A Shepherdess ....................Mary Ride

TEA FOR FACULTY AND 
SENIORS.
Miss Lyon, Miss Hanna and the 
Juniors of the Household Economics 
Department were hostesses at an af
ternoon tea on Friday, May 14, in 
the Little House. The faculty and 
the Senior class were the guests of 
the afternoon. The house was beau
tifully decorated with flowers, and the 
dining room where the refreshments 
were served, was artistically lighted 
by candles.
Nearly all of the Seniors and a num
ber of the faculty called during the 
hours of 3:30 to 5:30 and enjoyed 
greatly the tea which was one of the 
prettiest and most successful ones 
ever held in Margaret Morrison.
MARY RIDE PRESIDENT OF 
STUDENT GOVERNMENT 
ASSOCIATION.
At the yearly election of officers 
for the Student Government Associa
tion, held Tuesday, May 11, at 1:15 
oclock, Mary Ride was elected presi
dent for 1915-1916. Miss Ride is a 
Junior in the Household Economics 
Department, and is one of our ablest 
and best students. Since entering 
Margaret Morrison she has been ac
tively interested in school activities. 
The student body feels that in elect
ing Miss Ride they have chosen an 
ideal type of girl, and we are sure 
that the Association can but prosper 
under her administration.
Miss Ride is from McKeesport. She 
is president of the Guild and a mem
ber of the Dramatic Club, Glee Club 
and Athletic Association. We are 
sure that she has the right kind of 
school spirit and will be a worthy 
successor of the retiring president, 
Lee M. Hartman. Miss Hartman was 
the second president of the Associa
tion, and her untiring efforts have 
been effective in bringing the Asso
ciation from its infancy to a strong 
organization.
The other officers elected were: 
Vice President, Constance C. Stout. 
Secretary,
Treasurer,

THE BACCHANALIAN REVEL
The reminiscences of Greek pleas
ure and custom brought together a 
host of Design students upon the 
evening of May 13th. The Bacchana
lian Revel, for which extensive plans 
had been laid, proved the most unique 
and charming social event in the 
annals of the Design School and was 
enjoyed by more than 200 students.
At nine oclock the spirit of the 
evening revel was ushered in by the 
production of a Greek masque which 
took place upon the spacious terrace 
fronting the Design building. In 
esence the masque was a revival of 
Grecian life, depicting the story of 
a band of Greeks returning from the 
siege of Troy. Charming scenic ef
fect were secured by the careful use 
of colored lights, natural foliage and 
harp and flute music which, in com
bination with the beauties of a May 
evening, proved more than inspiring. 
The masque was arranged by How
ard F. Smith and Theodore A. Viehman, the following students of the 
School of Applied Design forming 
the dramatic personae.

As is true of most masques it em
bodied no definite design other than 
to serve as an introduction for the 
Greecian revel which was to perme
ate the evenings pleasure; but derived 
its success from the occasion for 
which it was written, the wit of the 
originators who furnished the words, 
the skill of the musicians who sup
plied the music and the ingenuity of 
the scene painter by whom the noc
turnal effects were produced.
The masque was followed by a 
Greecian Ball held in the corridors of 
the Design School. Here especial 
decorative effects were used to pro
duce an atmosphere of ancient anti
quity. The sparkling stone walls of 
the corridors were flanked with potted 
foliage, while a flow of mellow colored 
light from above produced a very nat
ural moonlight effect which fell little 
short of entrancing. Here the dance 
led far into the morning hours and 
produced to the visitors and spec
tators a scene which seemed to con
vey one far back over the lapse of 
ages to the days of Grecian festivals 
and ancient dances.
Aside from the pleasure afforded 
by such an occasion, one can always
find a key to instruction well worth
noting. The costumes were so well 
chosen as to serve as an instructor in 
themselves, and presented to the par
taker and observer a vivid idea of 
the dress of the early Greeks. The 
masque abounded with fertility and 
presented a clear conception of the 
superstition of the Greek people; of 
their love for whim and impulse, and 
yet also of their sprightness and sin
cerity, which enables a people to do 
everything with advantage.
Such occasions serve as an acute 
tonic to the imagination without 
which no man can become a real 
master. It stimulates the imagina
tion to its highest pitch of ascent 
and helps us to forget for a time at 
least, the paucity of our daily cycle. 
The sooner we learn to indulge often 
in such revels, the happier will be our 
college remembrances and at the 
same time, the more beneficial.
TENNIS MATCH.
Grove City and Tech Tie.
In a match featured by some most 
spectacular playing Carnegie Tech 
and Grove City battled to a tie on 
the Carnegie courts, yesterday after
noon. The most sensational set and 
probably the longest which will be 
seen in any college tennis match this 
season was that in which Black and 
Derstine of Grove City defeated Eng
lish and Bihlman of Tech, 15 to 13. 
The set lasted almost an hour and on 
it depended whether Carnegie should 
win or the match be a tie. As a re
sult, long after the other matches 
had been finished the crowd remained 
to watch the two teams fight it out.
There was nothing to the match 
between Steen of Tech and Byers of 
Grove City. The Tech man led 
throughout and took the first set 6-0. 
In the second set Sheen overcame 
Byers 6 to 2. Both sets were fast and 
Steen played some of the best tennis 
seen during the afternoon.
English of Tech opposed Black of 
Grove City. Black got a good start 
and had English 5 to 2 in the first set. 
But English pulled up rapidly and 
raised the score to 5 all. Black took 
the next two games and won 7 to 5. 
In the second set English displayed 
some fine tennis and outplayed his 
opponent, winning 6 to 1.
In the third set English continued 
to play his fine tennis, making some 
returns that were almost sensational. 
He outranked Black and won the set, 
6 to 4, thus taking the match.
Davis, of Carnegie, lost both sets 
to Davis, of Grove City. His play
ing was not quite up to form and his 
returns were rather wild. In spite of 
this he played spectacular tennis at 
times. Turner was steadier and with 
difficult work won the match, 6-2, 6-4.
Derstine, of Grove City, got off with 
a bad start, and lost his first set to 
Bihlman, 6 to 3. The Plaid racquetter 
looked like a sure winner and out
classed his opponent. But in the last 
two sets, Derstine came back strong 
and succeeded in vanquishing his op
ponent, 6 to 2 and 6 to 1. In the 
latter part of the match the visitor

out-played Bihlman, easily winning.
In the doubles, Davis and Steen, 
of Tech, had a hard time winning 
their first set of doubles from Byers 
and Turner, of Grove City. Neither 
team seemed able to gain any decisive 
lead on the other and the set went
9 to 7 to Tech after a hard tussle. 
Davis made a couple of returns which 
thrilled the spectators. In the second 
set Grove City was unable to keep up 
with the terrific brace of the Tech 
men and lost a love set to them.
The longest and most sensational 
set was the first one between English 
and Bihlman, of Carnegie, and Black 
and Derstine, of Grove City. Both 
teams were so evenly matched that 
for almost an hour they battled with 
each other before Grove City finally 
came to the front and won, 15 to 13. 
The set was a thriller from beginning 
to end and was featured by brilliant 
plays. English made a very difficult 
back hand return of a ball which 
bounded into the adjoining court. In 
the second set Grove City easily won 
over the tired Tech men, 6 to 1.
Match scores:
Singles:
Turner, Grove City, defeated Davis, 
Tech, 6-2, 6-4.
English, Tech, defeated Black, 
Grove City, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4.
Steen, Tech, defeated Byers, Grove 
City, 6-0, 6-2.
Derstine, Grove City, defeated Bihl
man, Tech, 3-6, 6-2, 6-1.
Doubles:
Davis and Steen, Tech, defeated 
Turner and Byers, Grove City, 
9-7, 6-0.
Black and Derstine, Grove City, de
feated English and Bihlman, 
Tech, 15-13, 6-1.

About 30 per cent of the institu
tions for higher education in this 
country have the honor system of 
conducting examinations in success
ful practice.
The news of the coming Mho ClubA. I. E. E. dinner has penetrated 
throughout the civilized world. This 
is seen from the fact that the Kaiser 
has asked the Allies for a temporary 
cessation of hostilities, in order that 
he may be able to attend this most 
brilliant affair. After due considera
tion on the part of the Allies, this re
quest has been granted, and in addi
tion Czar Nicholas, and King George 
have, with the Kaisers consent, de
cided to escort him here.
When the members of the ban
quet committee first learned of this 
movement on the part of the Kaiser 
they contemplated sending him a 
radiogram forbidding him to come; 
on account of his complete lack of 
electrical knowledge,, however, when 
it was heard that the Czar and King 
George intended to accompany him, 
they decided that with the great 
amount of electrical, as well as mili
tary knowledge possessed by these 
two illustrious effervescences of the 
evening into military terms, so that 
the Kaiser would be able to enjoy 
himself.
A committee consisting of Messrs. 
Lincoln, Dudley, Riker, Lavine, 
Welsh, and Leete will be on hand to 
receive this party upon their arrival 
at the Kaisers exclusive club on Craft 
avenue. These famous gentlemen of 
peace are scheduled to arrive at 7:30 
on Thursday evening, May 20th. 
There is no doubt but that they will 
arrive on time, since they use as their 
means of travel in this country the 
Pennsylvania Railroad and the Pitts
burgh Railways.

On Wednesday, May 5, 1915, the 
Southern Club held its regular 
monthly smoker in the French Room 
at the Schenley Hotel. This last of 
the year was quite an enjoyable event.
The guests of the evening were Mr. 
Henry McGoodwin, Mr. A. W. Tarbell, Mr. Henry McCorkle, Mr. How
ard R. Hoffman, Mr. Price and Mr. 
Edward Green. Mr. McGoodwin and 
Mr. McCorkle are honorary members 
of the organization.
During the course of the evening 
Mr. Hoffman gave several vocal selec
tions, accompanied on the piano by 
Mr. Green. They were heartily en
joyed by all present. Mr. Price also 
gave a monologue and several songs.
Probably the feature of the even
ing was the delivery of the shingles 
by Mr. Edwin Crump, president of 
the club. These shingles have been 
chosen as the club insignia and are 
made up of the three Confederate 
flags in color with the name of the 
person and state from which he 
comes.
The Southern Club, though less 
than a year old, has become quite 
active in this short time, largely

On account of the present war, the

will be abandoned. This will be the 
first time this has occurred since 1856.
The value of clean outer apparel is 
of great importance. We know from 
hearing comments expressed by all 
classes of people that ones outer 
appareance is most essential, for 
many times the selection of a man 
or woman for a better position in life 
depends, in part at least, upon his

PENN STATE VICTORIOUS.
Takes Fast Contest From Plaid Nine.
and one by Hasselbacher, cinched 
their victory. The box score:
After an up-hill contest Penn State 
managed to win over Carnegie, last 
Thursday, by the score of 7 to 4. The 
game was the second one which we 
have played with Penn State this sea
son and was as snappy as will be seen 
in many a day. The fielding was very 
fast at times and both sides are cred
ited with a goodly number of hits.
Pitcher Siebert went smoothly 
enough through the first three in
nings but when the fifth came he 
could no longer hold down the Tech 
batters. Three hits, a walk and a 
couple of errors were sufficient to 
bring in three runners. Then Hassel
bacher was called upon to do the res
cue work and he fanned two men and 
ended the rampage. With excellent 
support he didnt allow a single hit 
and struck out seven men. For the 
Plaid, Hines seemed to have the Blue 
and White batsmen under fair con
trol, but the sixth and ninth innings 
were fatal to him. Unfortunately, 
these were the only innings when his 
support was bad and this probably 
accounts for the defeat. But aside 
from that Techs infield played fine 
ball. Kesner and McClure got away 
with the honors in the outfield.
Doherty, at shortstop, played an 
excellent game with four put outs and 
four assists. Behind the bat Lain, as 
usual, was always to be depended 
upon. A couple of times he threw 
down to second in time to prevent a 
steal. Robinson, of the visitors, was 
another steady man, while Vogt, their 
catcher, played pretty ball.
Penn State scored their first run in 
the second inning, when Robinson 
singled and was brought in by a 
stolen base and an error by Smith. 
In the fourth, Josefson singled. Kannas brought him in on a single.
Then came Techs walloping ses
sion. Robinson muffed Hines fiy. 
McClures single sent Hines to third 
and when the ball was thrown to 
that sack in a vain attempt to put 
Hines out, the Tech center fielder 
went to second. Both men scored on 
Kesners hit. Lains single sent Kes
ner to third and an error by Vogt let 
both men in. Hasselbacher then went 
in for Penn State ,and retired the 
side.
But in the sixth Penn State over
came the lead of two runs and took 
the lead, when Kominars, Josefson, 
and Robinson scored. Two more 
runs in the ninth, one by Crawford

Also, Pitt is here in tennis, Wed

along the side lines. They were a

never heard from the stands in any 
sport. We should have the same

A game of football was played last 
week on Magnetic field by the Volts 
and Amperes. Ohm refereed, and 
since there were eleven Volts and 
eleven Amperes, his resistance was 
not great. The Volts started off with 
a rush, and soon had the ball near 
the poles. Here the Amperes began 
to turn and soon the line of force 
was so strong that the Volts could 
not split it in any phase of the game. 
Soon the Amperes became separately 
excited and by a full load run sent 
their back field through the oppo
nents team. This switch and a bat
tery of sudden charges made the 
Volts line drop, and gave the Am
peres the key to the situation. Soon 
they had the ball in mid-field, and a

few rushes on the end runs and a 
kick sent the ball over the high bar 
and scored three. All of the nuts 
who supported their Alma Motor 
made a bolt for the gap in the fence 
and chattered like poor brushes. 
They had been at a high tension all 
during the struggle. This game gave 
the Amperes the best rating in the 
league, as they refused to play the 
Commutators last week, claiming that 
they were not armatures.
