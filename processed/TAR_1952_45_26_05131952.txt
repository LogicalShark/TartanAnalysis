Mural By Lepper9 
P & D Professor9 
To Be Exhibited
A mural by Robert L. Lepper, 
professor of painting and design 
here, has been chosen as one of 
ten throughout the nation to be 
exhibited in the Architectural 
Leagues Gold Medal Show of 
Mural Painting in New York.
Leppers 80 foot mural, which 
he completed in 1950, has been 
hailed by critics for the way in 
which he solved the difficult prob
lem of design for a curved ceil
ing in the concourse of the mil
lion-dollar terminal building of 
the Kanawha airport at Charles
ton, West Virginia.
Professor Lepper spent a year in 
research, design, and preparation. 
But the actual painting of the 
mural was completed in two 
months of intensive work at the 
building.
He is author and designer of the 
exhibition Some Forces Behind 
Modern Art, which was exhibited 
at the Arts and Crafts Center in 
1948 and the following year at 
Carnegie Institute at the invita
tion of the Associated Artists of 
Pittsburgh. His painting and raetalic sculptures have been exhib
ited at Carnegie Institute and gal
leries throughout the East.
Mr. Lepper graduated from Tech 
i in 1927. He has taught painting 
; and design here for the past 22 . 
I years.

Petitions for class organiza
tions election may be submit
ted until 4:30 May 15, 1952,

May 19, 1952, must contact

17, 1952.
AE Phi Takes 
Skit Honors
Theta Wizard Follows 
Submission To Moscow
Alpha Epsilon Phi took first 
place for the second consecutive 
year in Varsity Varieties, the sor
ority skit competition, on Satur
day afternoon in Thistle Hall. The 
converted theater was packed with 
students and faculty who were 
thoroughly entertained by the sor
ority offerings.
Winning Skit
The winning skit was called 
Submission to Moscow. Sonia 
Lefsky Russianized the nursery 
rhymes and her pupils recited and 
sang them. Little Jack Horner be
came Jake Varner and Jack Be 
Nimble got out of Russia. (Quite a 
trick!).
Second place honors were taken 
by the Kappa Alpha Theta girls, 
who retc ld the story of the Wizard 
of Oz. The land that Dorothy 
wanted to come to was CIT, pro
nounced sit. Grimms Fairy 
Tales, a modernized version of old 
fables, including Red Riding Hood, 
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, 
and Cinderella, was the Kappa 
Kappa Gamma theme, which came 
in third.
Judges
The judges who chose the win
ning skits were Mr. Claessens, Dr. 
Norman Dawes, and Dr. John 
Lamber. Two able masters of 
ceremonies, Frank Gorshin and 
Bob Livingstone, introduced them 
and the skits with entertaining ad 
libs while the sets were being 
changed.
Other sorority skits included the 
Delta Delta Delta skit, Pinnocchio Under the Sea, the DGs 
Sleepy Time, and the Chi Ome
gas, Hansel and Gretel Fantasy.
Scotch ?n Soda
Although the echoes of 
Good Heavens have not died 
away in the gym yet, the 
Scotch n Soda board is inter
ested in having scripts for next 
years show as soon as possi
ble. While the final decision is 
sometime off, the board would 
like to talk to anyone who has 
an idea for the show. The 
script need not be complete.
Members of the Scotch n 
Soda club are asked to watch 
the bulletin board and next 
weeks Tartan to learn the 
date of the annual picnic for 
all club members. It will 
probably be scheduled on one 
of the remaining Sundays.
The Delts 134 lb. buggy cov
ered the sweepstakes course in 
2:36, followed by Kappa Sigma 
and Pi Kappa Alpha in that order. 
The winning time set a new speed 
record for the Carnival classic.
Realistic Effects 
The DTD float, based on the 
story of the Merchant and the 
Genie, presented a desert scene 
complete with Genie and six Nu
bian slaves.
Second was Kappa Sigma with 
a portray of the famous whale, 
Moby Dick, including a realistic 
effect in the form of steam shoot
ing from the monsters blowhole. 
Alpha Tau Omega copped third 
position with a presentation of 
some modern twists, including 
television and radar, to the ancient 
legend of King Arthurs court.
Destroyed by Fire 
Following the top three in the 
judging were Delta Upsilon (Al
la din), Pi Kappa Alpha (Snow 
White), Beta Sigma Rho (Alice in 
Wonderland), Theta Xi (King 
Neptunes Court), Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon (Gullivers travels), Beta 
Theta Pi (Wynken, Blynken, and 
Nod), and Tau Delta Phi (Hansel 
and Gretel).
The Sigma Nu entry of Cinder
ella met with disaster when a fire 
started by a short circuit in the 
amplifying system completely de
stroyed the float decorations.
In the judgments for sweep
stakes buggy design, Sigma Nu 
followed the Kappa Sig winner to 
take second place.

machines are amazing
but men are more so
Young ladies, if you will direct your atten
tion to the complex telephone equipment on 
the left, 1 think you'll agree with most folks 
who tour our telephone offices that it is
exceedingly impressive.
We think so too. But the minds of the 
men who developed it are even more im
pressive. Some people use the human ele
ment to denote weakness. In the Bell 
System^ we believe our greatest asset is our 
people.
They make headlines in fires, hurricanes 
and floods. But much more important, they 
give the worlds best telephone service all 
year round.
As the Bell System continues its growth, 
new and even more amazing machines are 
being created. And along with this growth 
is the need for college men with the right 
qualifications for work and opportunity in a 
variety of fields  in engineering, research, 
operating and administration.

In a cigarette, taste
makes the difference  
and Luckies taste better!
The difference between just smoking and 
really enjoying your smoke is the taste of a 
cigarette. You can taste the difference in the 
smoother, mellower, more enjoyable taste of a 
Lucky ... for two important reasons. First, 
L.S./M.F.T.Lucky Strike means fine tobacco 
... fine, mild tobacco that tastes better. Second, 
Luckies are made to taste better... proved bestmade of all five principal brands. So reach for a 
Lucky. Enjoy the cigarette that tastes better!

Irate Student Protests 
Carnegie Usurpation
by Phil Drew
When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary lor 
one person to dissolve the academic bands which have connected 
him with an organization, and to assume among the powers of the 
earth the separate and equal station which the laws of nature entitle
him, a decent respect for the*----------------------------------------------------------
opinions of mankind requires that
he should declare the causes which 
impel him to the separationWe 
hold these truths to be self-evi
dent, etc., etc.
But when a long train of abuses 
and usurpations evinces a de
sign to reduce him to absolute in
sanity, it is his right, it is his duty 
to throw off such educational sys
tems and to provide new guards 
for his future. The history of the 
present Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology is a history of repeated in
juries and usurpations all having 
the direct object of inducing mad
ness in its students. To prove this 
let us present the facts to a candid 
world:
1. Dean David has repeat
edly been discovered disguised 
as a girl at sorority parties, 
skulking around in quest of 
evidence as grounds for social 
probation.
2. The cashiers office de
prives us of the benefits of 
cashing checks for amounts 
other than those between 
$11.45 and $11.47 on days 
other than those under the 
sign of Libra under the full 
moon in the dead of night.
3. The ROTC department 
has persisted in awarding 2000 
demerits to a single student 
(me) selected by lot each 
semester in order to fill their 
quota.
4. I have in many cases 
been forced to emerge from

5. I failed to recognize a 
physics instructor on the cut 
and gave him a dime for a 
cup of coffee.
6. Tech has offered me a 
$2400 scholarshipto Pitt (a 
nearby liberal arts college).
I have appealed to their native 
justice and magnaminity to disa
vow these usurpations, but they 
have been deaf to the voice of 
justice and of consanguinity. I, 
therefore, solemnly publish and 
declare that all connection be
tween me and Carnegie Tech is 
and ought to be totally dissolved.

J. Paul Sheedy* Switched to Wildroot Cream-Oil 
Because He Flunked The Finger-Nail Test
"YOUR HAIR looks as though its been in the rein, deer, a 
campus Caribou told Sheedy. "If you want to horn in on the 
sororities, it might behoof a man of your elk to try Wildroot 
Cream-Oil, Americas Favorite Hair Tonic. Contains soothing 
Lanolin. Non-alcohoiic. Grooms hair neatly and naturally all 
day long. Relieves annoying dryness. Removes moose, ugly dand
ruff. Helps you pass the Finger-Nail Test I Paul got Wildroot 
Cream-Oil and now no girl wonders whether hes man or moose! 
If your moose is cooked by unruly hair, collect a little doe and 
take a taxi-dermist to the nearest drug or toilet goods counter 
for a bottle or tube of Wildroot Cream-Oil. And ask for it on 
your hair at the barber shop so your deer wont think youve let 
herd down. (What shell say will be moose-ic to your ears!)
