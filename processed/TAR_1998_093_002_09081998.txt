Lost keys lead to new dorm locks
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor 
& MICHELLE CHAO
Tartan Staffwriter
After the recent loss of at least one 
residence hall master key, Housing Ser
vices and Facilities Management Ser
vices (FMS) are changing the entrance
locks for 11 residence halls _______
and discontinuing the use of 
entrance keys in the five 
dorms with card readers. New 
exterior door keys were is
sued last Thursday for the 
residence halls that do not 
have card readers.
Campus housing that is not 
owned by CMU, such as 
Cathedral Mansions and 
Fairfax Apartments, is not affected by the changes since Housing 
Services does not have master keys to 
these buildings.
Because we do not want to provide 
any information that may aid in the 
unauthorized use of the lost keys, I can
not discuss the specifics of how or when 
the loss of keys occurred, said Tim 
Michael, director of Housing Services.
The impression I got was they lost the 
keys to the main doors, not to the rooms 
themselves, said Pamela Contrera, a 
first-year biology major. However, Cam
pus Police and Housing are taking extra 
measures to increase the safety of those 
living in residence halls since the lost 
keys do open individual room doors.
The number of Campus Police foot 
patrols has been increased in all resi
dential areas and buildings. Although 
we have no evidence that this situation 
presents any risk to students, these

lock changes were the necessary re
sponse to restore our external door key 
security, said Michael. As always, 
residents are encouraged to lock doors 
and report strangers or unusual activ
ity anywhere on campus to Campus 
Police. These steps will ensure entrance 
security in campus residences.
Even if the master keys were stolen or 
found by someone with a CMU ID, it 
would be difficult for the individual to 
determine which dorm door it opens. 
According to Michael, the keys are not
marked in any way, so someone who 
finds the keys cannot easily find and 
open the corresponding doors. For this 
reason, Housing is not revealing which 
dorms the lost master keys were for.
Im not going to freak out about it or 
lose any sleep, but at the same time I 
would like to know if someone has the 
key to my room, said Kelly Caranchini,
______ a first-year design major. I
have insurance for my stuff. 
Housing Services is review
ing the security of individual 
room doors within the 
residence hall buildings, 
according to Michael. The 
evaluations may find that a 
patented lock system or an 
electronic card access system 
is necessary for maximum 
safety in the dorms.
The patented lock system, with keys 
that are almost impossible to duplicate, 
was implemented in some CMU resi
dence halls during summer 1997. Each 
key in the system is patented for 12 years 
and has the potential to significantly 
minimize security problems. Housing will 
decide if it is necessary to implement the 
system in all residence halls.
For now, the increased security and 
new door locks will have to suffice. I 
dont think there is anything else they 
could really do, said Contrera.
Campus Police earn 
ethics certification
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Wednesday afternoon, the Na
tional Institute of Ethics (NIE) presented 
CMUs police department with a plaque 
for being the first police department in 
the United States to be certified for law 
enforcement integrity.
Neal Trautman, director of the NIE, 
presented the award to Chief of Cam
pus Police James LaPaglia. Trautman 
also said that he expected the City of 
Pittsburgh police department to be the 
fourth department to be certified in 
this way, preceded by the National Park 
Rangers and the Colorado Police De
partment. The NIE, which Trautman 
said is the United States largest world
wide provider of law enforcementethics 
training, is a non-profit organization 
with chapters in every state.
Why did we do this? said LaPaglia. 
Not because we have problems, but 
because we wanted to set standards. 
LaPaglia had been hopeful that the nega
tively perceived City of Pittsburgh po
lice department would be the first certi
fied. It would have done some good, he 
said, but they had too much to do.
Both LaPaglia and Preston Covey, di
rector of CMUs Center for the Advance
ment of Applied Ethics, are directors at 
different levels of the NIE, raising ques
tions about their involvement in CMUs 
police department certification.
I see no conflict of interest at all,
LaPaglia said. Having our department 
first benefits Pennsyvania and Pitts
burgh as well as our department. He 
said that both he and the Norristown, 
Pennsylvania chief of police are 
Pennsylvanias chapter directors. 
Trautman announced the certification 
program while in a meeting with 
LaPaglia and the Norristown chief, and 
LaPaglia said that CMUs police depart
ment was able to become the first certi
fied because he knew about the program 
early on.
[My] being chapter director gave us a 
leg up because we were able to start 
working on it before anyone else even 
knew of the program. We helped write 
the brochure, and this helped us get a 
head start because we were in on the 
consultation portion of it, LaPaglia said.
While I serve on the Board of Direc
tors of the National Institute of Ethics, I 
played no role in the CMU police depart
ment receiving this award, said Covey, 
who attended the presentation. 
[LaPaglial has taken over from me the 
office of the Pennsylvania regional di
rector for the NIE, providing training in 
ethics, diversity issues, and other topics 
in courses certified by the Pennsylvania 
State Municipal Police Officers Educa
tion and Training Comission, he said.
Coveys involvement with the NIE has 
resulted in several training programs for 
the department. In 1993, when the CMU

Study vindicates Gen Xers
BOSTON (AP)  Tough to moti
vate. Too expectant. Lazy. All com
mon labels for Generation Xers.
A new study released this Labor 
Day, however, suggests that these al
legedly malcontented 20-somethings 
may fit into the workplace better than 
employers previously thought. It just 
takes some training.
According to a survey by The Gallup 
Organization, employer-sponsored 
training and education is a major at
traction for Gen Xers looking for jobs. 
And workers say theyre more likely to 
stick with companies that invest in 
such programs. According to the sur
vey, workers most want computer skills, 
followed closely by training in commu
nications and management skills.
And while a majority ofbaby boomers 
and even the most senior employees 
said they appreciated training, mem
bers of Generation X gave on-the-job 
education the highest marks.
Employees want more training than 
they are getting, said Christine
Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the com
panies that commissioned the survey.
The United States alone spends 
something like $60 to $70 billion a 
year in workplace education and train
ing, and we thought it was about time 
to ask people who are receiving it if 
they are receiving any benefits, said 
Rich Wellins, senior vice president of 
the Pittsburgh-based Development 
Dimensions International, one of the 
three co-sponsors.
Wellins said many U.S. companies 
lag behind their Japanese and Euro
pean counterparts in terms of train
ing dollars spent per worker. Invest
ing in worker education can boost 
employee loyalty, he said.
What you hear about Generation X 
in todays workplace is they want to 
do their own thing. They dont want to 
manage. They dont want to be man
aged, Wellins said. On the other 
hand, they also have a keen desire to 
develop their skills so they themselves 
can be more marketable.

Sizing up CMU fashion

Tartan News Editor
Some students carry around 
art supplies all day. Others tote 
40-pound physics books on their 
backs. But Sarah Gross, student 
body president Junior social his
tory major, and spearhead of the 
Morewood Basement renova
tions, spent last Monday haul
ing around a box filled with bath
room stall divider samples.
Right now, were deciding 
things like what vendor were 
going to have and what colors 
were goingto use, said Gross at 
last Mondays Morewood Base
ment committee meeting.
Although Student Government 
had hoped to finish the renova
tions and open the space by the 
beginning of this semester, re
modeling was delayed because 
the Carnegie Mellon Child Care
Center was using the space over 
the summer. But plans are mov
ing ahead, and although the 
project still needs about $40,000 
to fully refurbish the basement, 
Gross is confident that with the 
continued assistance of the Office 
of Student Affairs, they will be 
able to completely fund the project.
Since last spring, the commit
tee has solidified remodeling 
plans. It has still not been deter
mined whether the basement will 
include a smoking area  sepa
rated from the main eating area 
by a glass partition  but the 
area will have a 5,000 square foot 
eating area and a 15x12 foot stage. 
The committee still plans on hav
ing students decorate the space 
with murals, vintage furniture, 
and unusual lighting fixtures. Ul
timately, the committee hopes to 
create a space where bands and 
DJs can play, and where students
can have readings and can social
ize away from the pressures of 
study groups and classes.
Id almost like to see us go 
back to the pre-UC situation, 
where you had an undergraduate 
hangout like Scotland Yard and a 
graduate hangout like Tilted 
Square, said Grant Bromhal, 
Graduate Student Association 
president and a masters student 
in civil and environmental engi
neering. Two different atmo
spheres, but have both open to all 
CMU students.
The committee still hasnt se
lected a food vendor, however. 
Gross said that the committee 
had been talking to such vendors 
as Big Burrito (the company that 
owns Mad Mex) and Mozzerellas 
(a bar-and-grill restaurant simi
lar to Applebees), since CMUs 
Dining Services does not want to 
manage the food operations.
Right now, the space is 
up to code for food prepa
ration, but not for cook
ing, she said. For ex
ample, you could heat 
soup in the kitchen, but 
you couldnt actually pre
pare it there. Depending 
on who we get for a ven
dor, well see if they want 
to actually prepare food 
there or not.
Several other factors 
have not been decided yet, 
such as operating hours 
and whether the hangout 
will accept Campus 
Xpress, DineXpress, and/ 
or credit cards.
Gross said that while it 
would probably not be feasible 
to keep the space open 24 
hours a day, the committee was 
aiming for hours similar to 
the Os  that is, from around

lunchtime until two or three in 
the morning.
Were concentrating right now 
on getting the place open, said 
John Paul, a fifth-year mechani
cal engineering student and 
chairman of the basement com
mittee. Next semester, we want 
to open it, have a vendor, and 
then well build from there.

Divers find flight recorder, 
fuselage at wreckage site
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) - 
Divers battling murky, choppy seas 
found crucial clues on the ocean floor 
Sunday  one of the two flight record
ers of Swissair Flight 111 and three 
large pieces of wreckage believed to be 
the planes fuselage.
It was a major breakthrough for 
investigatois, who previously had 
gathered little concrete evidence to 
shed light on why the MD-11 jetliner 
plunged into the sea Wednesday, kill
ing all 229 people on board.
Another search team, using airborne 
gas-detection equipment, said it had 
located 19 concentrations of human 
remains on the seabed. Douglas Copp 
of American Rescue Team Interna
tional said it was too early to 
tell how many bodies might be at 
those locations.
Vic Gerden, the chief crash investi
gator, said the flight-data recorder 
retrieved by divers would be flown to a 
laboratory in Ottawa for examination. 
If its in good condition, it would pro
vide more than 100 types of technical 
data that could help explain why the 
planes cockpit filled with smoke and 
why the pilots emergency conversa
tion with traffic controllers was cut off 
six minutes before the crash.
The so-called black box and the 
wreckage were found five miles off
shore at a depth of 190 feet by divers 
working with hand-held sonar devices. 
Gerden said the 12 divers were able to 
work at that depth for only about seven 
minutes at a time, with their visibility 
limited to about 10 feet.
Divers will continue searching for 
the second black box  the cockpit 
voice recorder that would reveal other 
noises in the cockpit in addition to 
the already available conversation 
with controllers.
The flight-data recorder was 
found near the three large pieces 
of wreckage.
Some of them are squashed. Its in 
very poor shape, but it is visible and it 
looks like an aircraft fuselage, said 
Capt. Phil Webster, a navy spokesman.
On land, victims families and resi
dents were still trying to come to grips 
with the tragedy. More than 300 family 
members have flown to Halifax from 
New York, the planes starting point, 
and Geneva, its intended destination.
This has been a horrible week, 
said the Rev. Richard Walsh, pausing 
to choke back tears in his sermon at 
St. Peters Anglican Church in a coastal 
town near the search site. Im sorry, 
Ill be OK, he told his congregation 
after a pause.
The Swissair plane crashed 16 min
utes after the pilots reported smoke in 
the cockpit and decided to attempt an 
emergency landing. The plane started 
toward the Halifax airport but made 
two sharp turns as it started to de
scend and dump fuel.
In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair of
ficials said they had reconstructed the 
final phase of the flight, based on in
formation from Canadian investiga
tors. They said the plane couldnt have 
made a direct approach to Halifax 
from where it made the first distress 
call because it was flying too high and 
was too heavy.
The call was made 70 miles out of 
Halifax, but the pilots would have 
needed 130 miles to make a direct 
landing, Swissairs chief pilot, Rainer 
Ililtebrand, said. However, he said 
attempting to land in Halifax was still 
better than trying for Boston, 
which the pilots initially suggested 
to controllers.
Swissair said memorial services for 
victims would be held Friday in New 
York, Geneva, and Zurich. A series of 
memorial services was planned over 
the next several days in Halifax and 
surrounding towns.
Walsh, at one of the services, said 
residents of the region would remem
ber these tragic days for the rest of 
their lives.
Every time we drive by the ocean or 
the rocks, we will remember the people 
who have become spiritually part of 
our community, he said. We will re
member and we will never forget.
Hackers rephrase

FDA gives OK to 
morning-after pill
WASHINGTON (AP) - Groups hoping 
to cut back on unplanned pregnancies are 
cheering the governments decision to let 
a company advertise and market morn
ing-after pills meant to prevent preg
nancy up to three days after sex.
ItS been more than a year since the 
government said the combination of 
regular birth control bills was safe and 
effective, but few women have used it. 
Not until Wednesday, however, had the 
Food and Drug Administration approved 
a companys plans to market it.
That has to make it more available to 
women, said Janet Benshoof, president 
of the Center for Reproductive 
Law and Policy. Very few women, 
particularly lower-middle-class women, 
know how to get it.
The PREVEN kits, made by Gynetics 
Inc. of Somerville, N.J., will be available 
by prescription by the end of September. 
The company anticipates that women
will seek them out after unprotected sex 
or keep them in their medicine cabinets 
just in case.
Already, there are efforts to spread 
the word.
Planned Parenthood is considering 
setting up a national hot line for women 
to talk with health care providers 
and have prescriptions called in to 
local pharmacies.
A project in Seattle allowed pharma
cists to prescribe the pills using guide
lines established by doctors, allowing 
women to get them with a trip to a 
drugstore. In three months, more than
2,000 doses were dispensed.
It just shows you the degree to which 
we underestimate how often little emer
gency situations happen, said Dr. Felicia 
Stewart of the Kaiser Family Founda
tion, which backed the project.
The emergency contraceptives side 
effects are nausea and vomiting, 
sometimes severe, similar to 
those some women experience with 
regular contraceptives.
The pills have been 75 percent effec
tive at preventing pregnancy in tests 
when taken within three days of sex. 
But few doctors have prescribed them. 
By contrast, regular contraceptive 
pills taken properly are 99 
percent effective.
Physicians are kind of waiting to be 
asked. Since women dont know about it, 
they dont ask, Stewart said, citing a 
Kaiser survey of doctors and patients 
about the pills last year.
European women have used the 
PREVEN technique for years, but most 
U.S. contraceptive makers have resisted 
selling emergency birth control 
because of worries over litigation 
and politics.
. The PREVEN kits will include only 
the four pills needed for emergency 
contraception. Each kit will sell 
for about $20 and also include a 
pregnancy test.
The PREVEN method consists of tak
ing two oral contraceptive pills contain
ing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel 
within 72 hours of unprotected sex, and 
another two pills 12 hours later.
For every 100 women who have unpro
tected sex during the second or third 
week of their menstrual cycle, eight nor
mally would become pregnant. Only two 
would if the 100 women took the 
emergency birth control, according 
to studies.
Carnegie Mellon psychology study shows Internet causes depression
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Even 
though users of the Internet tend 
*to dwell in its social corners  
jchat rooms and email  they feel 
more depressed and lonely the 
more time they spend online, 
ia study suggests. 
i The groundbreaking study 
surprised even its authors, led 
fcy Robert Kraut, a social 
psychology professor at 
(Carnegie Mellon University 
an Pittsburgh.
I We were expecting exactly 
!the opposite, Kraut said Sun
day. Before his research, he be
lieved Internet use fostered so
cial contact, especially in email 
^nd chat rooms.
One reason for the negative 
effect may have been that using 
the Internet left less time 
for the deeper relationships 
of friends and family, 
he suggested.
People are substituting weaker 
social ties for stronger ones, he 
said. Theyre substituting con
versations on narrower topics 
with strangers for conversations 
with people who are connected to 
their life.
Kraut and his colleagues 
followed 93 Pittsburgharea families for two years. 
The families were given 
computers, phone lines, and 
use of the Internet for free, in
return for agreeing to fill out 
occasional questionnaires.
The true-false questionnaires 
included such statements as I 
cant find companionship when I 
want it, I felt that everything I 
did was an effort, and I felt I 
could not shake off the blues, 
even with help from my family 
and friends.
The number of hours 
they spent online were 
recorded electronically.
Participants levels of depres
sion and loneliness were mea
sured at the start of the study. 
At the end of the two years, re
searchers found they could pre
dict changes in an individuals
emotional state according to 
the number of hours spent on 
the Internet.
The reverse was not true. De
pression and loneliness doesnt 
predict subsequent use of the 
Internet, Kraut said.
Heavy Internet users also re
ported fewer close friends and 
complained more about lifes mi
nor stresses, such as arguments 
and bills.
The $1.5 million study was 
funded by the National Science 
Foundation, the nonprofit 
Markle Foundation, and 13 
computer, software, or communi
cations companies, including 
AT&T Research, Bell Atlantic,
the U.S. Postal Service, Apple 
Computer, Hewlett Packard, and 
Intel. It is to be published 
this week in The American 
Psychologist, the monthly 
journal of the American 
Psychological Association.
One study participant, 17-yearold Andrea Rubinsky of Pitts
burgh, said she didnt feel any 
worse for her Internet use, al
though shes gone online less since 
the study began. She started out 
using it 10 hours to 15 hours per 
week but now averages about 
three hours.
It just also might be I 
have more things to do now, 
Andrea said.

50 YEARS AGO, September 
22,1948  Rush Week climaxed 
that evening, as fatigued frater
nity men and rushees looked ex
pectantly toward the appearance 
of pledge pins and the end of 
interfraternity rushing hostility.
Each fraternity attempted to 
outdo the others in trying to impress prospective pledges. 
Among the lures for freshmen 
were attractive new interior 
decorations in fraternity houses, 
colorful parties and picnics, and 
the inevitable promise of intro
ductions to datable young ladies. 
Some fraternities even went so 
far as to secure dates in advance 
for the rushees.
25 YEARS AGO, September 
25,1973,  After months of hard 
work and waiting, WRCT re
ceived a permit from the FCC
allowing them to have an FM 
antenna erected at CMU. A 
transmitter which was prebuilt 
and set to broadcast at 88.3 MHz 
was shipped to the radio station, 
as well.
The antenna was built 30 feet 
above Skibo, giving the station a 
range of 5-7 miles, a vast im
provement over the AM antenna, 
whose range barely extended 
throughout the campus.
Student Government footed the 
bill for the new equipment, which 
cost around $2,000.
10 YEARS AGO, September 
13, 1988  CMU adopted an in
door smoking ban on campus ex
cept in specified places, such as 
dormitories and certain sections 
of dining facilities. Under the new 
policy, 25 to 50 percent of dining 
seats were labeled as non-smok
ing. The University did not ban 
smoking in dormitories, leaving 
the decision up to SDC and the 
Housing Office. Private resi
dences were exempt from the 
Pittsburgh law passed the previ
ous November.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Septem

ics major died of cancer at Pres

Russian market 
turmoil continues
MOSCOW (AP) - The ruble collapsed 
dramatically and Central Bank Chair
man Sergei Dubinin offered to resign as 
economic turmoil and political instabil
ity rocked Russia again Monday.
Trading in U.S. dollars was canceled 
on the Moscow interbank currency ex
change because people only wanted to 
buy dollars, not sell them. However, 
deals that are to take effect Tuesday 
pegged the exchange rate at as much as 
30 rubles to the dollar.
Thats down from an official rate that 
was 17 rubles to the dollar on Friday and 
20.66 Monday. The ruble was trading at 
just over six to the dollar when the crisis 
hit last month.
Everyone is waiting for the confirma
tion of the prime minister and the an
nouncement of a new economic program, 
said acting deputy premier Boris 
Fyodorov. If there are no offers, the 
(ruble) price can be anything.
The rubles continued crash indicated 
the market had little faith in an immedi
ate resolution to the political standoff 
between President Boris Yeltsin and his 
rivals in parliament.
The State Duma, parliaments lower 
house, was to hold a second vote today 
on Yeltsins candidate for prime minis
ter, Viktor Chernomyrdin. The Com
munists and their allies who control 
the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin 
last week and have vowed to oppose 
him again.
The market also reacted to the news 
that Dubinin has offered his resigna
tion. Dubinin blamed parliament for fail
ing to adopt anti-crisis measures.
There is no government and no chair
man at the Central Bank, said Roman 
Serov, trader at Moscows ABN-Amro 
Bank. I cant see anything good result
ing from this.
Chernomyrdin, who said he wants the 
Central Bank to print more money to 
help pay off overdue wages and pen
sions, criticized Dubinin over the week
end. Dubinin has favored a tough mon
etary policy.
Russias battered economy has been in 
a free fall since mid-August, with the 
ruble collapsing, prices soaring, and the 
government effectively defaulting on 
foreign loans.
She made no lasting friends 
through the chat rooms, she said, 
but does use email to keep up with 
friends she has met in person.
Her father, Peter, also 
didnt feel he ever neglected 
personal relationships to spend 
time online.
I would say theres a conflict 
with other things that needed 
to get done. The grass didnt 
get mowed sometimes, and 
the car didnt get washed, 
Rubinsky said.
The study will continue in or
der to examine what might pro
duce the emotional effects and 
how computer use compares with 
television use.
Morewood Gardens and Mudge 
House. Although the new dorm 
would reduce housing shortages 
for students, it raised concerns 
among local residents.
A meeting was held between 
Michael Murphy and the resi
dents of Devonshire Road, a pri
vate residential street adjacent 
to the proposed building site.
CMU was considering building 
a nine-story dormitory, but the 
residents were concerned about 
preserving their community.
The conflict of interest here is 
that there are a number of 
homeowners who object to the 
building of a dorm as large as the 
one the University would like to 
build, said David Fowler, a resi
dent of Devonshire Road.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  8 September 19985
Ethics institute honors CMU Campus Police for integrity
POLICE, from page 1
ers to semi-automatic handguns, it con
sulted Covey, who is also a member of the 
International Association of Law Enforce
ment Firearms Instructors. In Novem
ber of19931 provided a transitional train
ing course for the police, employing the 
top instructor in the nation, he said.
In early 1994 Covey also provided an 
academic seminar on ethical issues .in 
law enforcement for Campus Police.
Certification involves complying with 
seven standards set by the NIE.
We started on it in December. The 
most time-consuming task was the integ
rity needs assessment where we had to 
gather internal records, said LaPaglia. 
In addition to this, all officers underwent 
eight hours of ethics training, and now all 
in-service courses must relate to ethics. 
The department also developed a code of 
honor signed by all of the officers which is 
prominently displayed on the wall in the 
police dispatch office on the second floor 
of the Student Center.
Another criterion for certification was
to perform an early warning survey.
We also developed an early interven
tion survey where we looked for pat
terns so we can give them help before 
problems arrive, said LaPaglia.
In addition to the confidential survey, 
the early warning intervention system 
procedure examines complaint records, 
civil suit records, use of force records, 
grievance records, sick time, and other 
internal records.
The final condition for certification is 
that the CMU police department pro
vide semiannual status updates and 
annual official reports to the NIE.
LaPaglia said that he wasnt certain of 
the impact that such programs would 
have in the future. Regardless of the type 
of organization, be it Campus Police or 
Computer Science, if you have the highest 
standards relatingto integrity, everything 
else will fall into place, he said.
President Jared Cohon, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Michael Murphy, Provost 
Paul Christiano, Associate Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Paul Fowler, and members
of Campus Police attended the ceremony.
The police department provided lead
ership to the entire Carnegie Mellon 
community through their efforts, which 
have now been singled out as exemplary 
by a national organization, said Cohon.
Im very proud of it because were the 
first department in the nation to be 
certified, said Police Sergeant William 
Ricci. Ethics and integrity are the most 
important issues for law enforcement. 
Im honored to be a part of this fine 
police department.

6The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  8 September 1998
Crime and Incident Report
8/29 MEDICAL, 3:49 pm - A 
victim contacted Campus Police 
because she thought she had food 
poisoning. She had vomited in 
the morning and slept through 
the afternoon. She said that she 
had eaten lasagna and Chinese 
take-out the day before. Although 
the officer offered her transport 
to a hospital, she declined.
8/31 BICYCLE THEFT, 5:36 
am  A Morewood Gardens resi
dent witnessed the theft of two 
bicycles from the dormitorys 
rack. Two officers patrolled the 
surrounding area with negative 
results for the two persons whom 
the witness described.
The officers then went to speak 
with the witness. He stated that he 
was in the Morewood courtyard 
smoking a cigarette when one of 
the actors rode up to him on a red 
bike, asking for a cigarette. After a 
brief conversation, the actor left 
only to return later, this time riding 
a silver bike with another male 
accompanying him. At this point, 
the witness saw the two males 
pulling on the bikes on the racks 
and then running off towards the 
Morewood parking lot.
The officers checked the bike 
rack and found that two cable 
locks on the ground that had been 
cut clean by cable cutters.
8/31 MEDICAL, 9:14 am - A 
Facilities Management Services 
employee was climbing the Physi
cal Plant Buildings loading dock 
stairs, taking two steps at a 
time, when he felt a pop 
in his left hamstring. Campus 
Police transported him to 
Shadyside Hospital.
8/31 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
1:59 pm  A CMU faculty mem
ber requested that a Campus Po
lice officer be sent to the Wean 
Hall 5400 corridor womens 
restroom. There he showed the 
dispatched officer writingthat had 
been spray painted in orange on 
two of the restroom walls. The 
graffiti read, You dont know it, 
but were going to kill you. Also 
the numerous slats that comprised 
the vertical blinds covering the 
window were bent. FMS was noti
fied to clean up the damage.
8/31 FIGHT, 10:53 pm - Two 
males not affiliated with CMU 
were using the Skibo Gym weight 
room. At some point, one of the 
two men (Fighter 1) grabbed the 
others (Fighter 2s) left buttock 
while telling him to hurry up and 
finish his weight routine. The two 
began wrestling. The wrestling 
match developed into a fullfledged fight when Fighter 2 be
came aggressive and struck 
Fighter 1 in the chin. While try
ing to get away, Fighter 1 was 
kneed twice in the left eye by 
Fighter 2. Also, Fighter 1 received 
a cut on his right index finger 
because he grabbed a sharp part 
of the dumbbell rack while trying 
to keep from falling.
The desk attendant witnessed 
the fight and contacted Campus 
Police. By the time an officer 
arrived, the fight had ended. 
Both actors said that as far as 
they were concerned, the inci
dent was over. The officer, upon 
discovering that neither of the 
men was affiliated with CMU, 
advised the pair not to return to 
CMU property or they would be 
cited for trespassing.
9/1 DEMONSTRATION,
12:00 pm  An animal rights 
organization held a demonstra
tion in front of Doherty Hall. Six 
demonstrators distributed pam
phlets that protested alleged pri
mate research at Mellon Insti
tute. They also held up a banner 
which read Stop Animal Experi
ments. The demonstration oc
curred without incident.
9/2 MEDICAL, 10:49 am - A 
CMU faculty member was going 
through the bottom drawer of her
filing cabinet in her Margaret 
Morrison office. She bumped the 
cabinet with her knee and a fire 
extinguisher which had been rest
ing atop the cabinet fell three feet 
and struck her in the head. When 
a Campus Police officer arrived, 
she had already put ice on the 
swelling bump on her head. She 
was taken to Shadyside Hospital.
9/2 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 10:34 pm  An anony
mous complainant called Cam
pus Police to report that people at 
a fraternity were outside break
ing bottles, yelling, and scream
ing. Two officers were dispatched 
to the fraternity quad. As they 
approached the fraternity house 
in question, they heard extremely 
loud music playing and the sound 
of two bottles shattering. The of
ficers ordered the music be shut 
off. Since the president of the 
fraternity was not present, the 
officers gave the vice-president 
an internal citation.
9/3 THEFT/TRESPASS, 2:05 
pm  A Mellon Institute faculty 
member noticed two young males, 
approximately 12 years old, try
ing office door knobs on the sec
ond floor of the building to see if 
they were locked. Three Campus 
Police officers responded to her
call. They saw the actors cross 
Bellefield Avenue to the lawn of 
the Cathedral of Learning.
The officers stopped the pair 
near the log cabin at Forbes Av
enue and Schenley Drive. They 
were drinking soda from cans, 
and each of them had another 
one in his pocket. They said they 
were in Mellon Institute visiting 
the mother of a friend. The offic
ers contacted the woman, and 
she confirmed their claims. The 
boys were released into her cus
tody, and the two unopened bev
erages were returned to the sec
ond'floor refrigerator that they 
had been stolen from.
9/3 MEDICAL, 10:19 pm - A 
CMU student was riding his bike 
near Fifth Avenue and Aiken 
Avenue. When he tried to jump a 
curb he fell off his bike and hit 
his shoulder on the pavement. 
CMU EMS responded to the 
scene and applied an ice pack to 
the injury. The victim was taken 
to the Presbyterian Hospital 
emergency room.
9/5 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 3:07 am  A student was 
struck by a water balloon as she 
was walking by the West Wing 
dormitory. She saw where the 
balloon had been thrown from and 
directed the responding officer to 
the third floor of the dormitory.
The officer went to the corre
sponding room and was permit
ted entrance by one of the resi
dents. The officer questioned the 
three men about the water bal
loons, but all three denied in
volvement. The officer noticed 
that their window did not have 
screens, so he looked in the bath
room and saw two balloons in the 
waste basket.
The officer showed the men the 
balloons, and one of them admit
ted to throwing the balloons. He 
was the same male involved in an 
altercation at the University 
Bookstore the week before. He 
was issued an internal citation. 
The extra balloons were placed in 
the temporary storage locker.
9/6 MEDICAL, 5:05 am - A 
person walking along Forbes Av
enue noticed a man sleeping near 
the Beeler Street exit of the Tech 
Garage. As the responding offic
ers approached, the man awoke 
and tried to run away. He col
lided with a wall, however, allow-. 
ing the officers to stop him. He 
was clearly intoxicated and dis
oriented. He stated that he was 
a California resident visiting 
Pittsburgh. After City Medics 
completed their assessment, 
the man was transported to 
Presbyterian Hospital.
 Campus Chief of Police James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports prior 
to release.
 Only three people on The Tar
tan staff see the reports: the editor-in-cliief the news editor, and 
the staffwriter typing the report.

Carnegie Mellon University8 September 1998
Students must push 
for new social venue
Ever since Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Murphy promised 
space in Morewood Basement to 
the CMU student body last year, 
Student Government has been 
planning renovations that will turn 
the area into a student hangout. 
However, student support for this 
initiative has fizzled over the sum
mer months. While the space is still 
in the planning stages for a student 
hangout, lack of student enthusi
asm couldbringtheMoiewoodBasement plans to a halt.
CMU administrators have 
pledged their support of this 
project, but if they arent con
vinced of students commitment, 
they may not feel the project is 
important enough for swift 
completion. Students should con
tact their senators and student 
government to see how they can 
help the plans for the Morewood 
Basement progress.
A student hangout that provides 
food and a chance to relax is still 
missing from this campus. Cur
rently, only the 0 stays open 
late at night, and it doesnt pro
vide an atmosphere in which stu
dents can unwind. But with the 
Morewood Basement space, a Sen
ate committee has been looking 
for an outside vendor to provide 
food that will feature meals for 
under five dollars until 2 or 3 am. 
In addition to food, the committee 
has been planning student-decorated walls, live music and possi
bly even smoking. These prepa
rations slate the Morewood Basement as a student creation simi
lar to Scotland Yard, the hangout 
in Skibo which was demolished 
four years ago.
When the University Center 
opened in 1996, the administra
tion intended Skibo Coffeehouse 
to take the place of the old Scot
land Yard. But with its sterile 
environment and poor location, it 
never filled that space for stu
dents. CMU still lacks that one 
on-campus spot where everyone 
can gather together outside of 
class and their study groups.
According to a survey Student 
Government conducted last year, 
students agree that this project is 
important to them, but now they 
need to do more. Last spring, Stu
dent Government worked aggres
sively to create building plans, 
contact vendors, and find fund
ing. Over the summer, both stu
dent and administrative enthusi
asm seemed to have diminished, 
therefore progress on the project 
has slowed accordingly.
It is up to the students to let 
both Student Government and the 
administration know that this is 
something they want and some
thing to which they will contrib
ute. Contact your student sena
tor or show up at a Student Sen
ate meeting and ask about the 
planning developments. Because 
in the end, Morewood basement 
will be for students, and, hope
fully, run by students, so it is the 
students who must take an active 
interest now.
Career Center should 
not require training
The Career Center has recently 
updated its resources by adopt
ing a Web-based career database 
called TartanTRAK. While the 
student body should be able to 
benefit from this Web-based jobtracking tool, the Career Center 
did not advertise the new pro
gram adequately, and it is negat
ing the programs efficiency and 
convenience by requiring students 
to attend training sessions.
Carnegie Mellon is a computeroriented community where Webbrowsing is part of most students 
daily lives. Therefore, learning a 
new service such as TartanTRAK 
does not require attending an 
hour-long meeting where advi
sors show a videotape of someone 
using the Web.
It certainly doesnt require at
tending this hour-long session ev
ery year, as the Career Center is 
currently mandating. Since there 
are always those who need assis
tance whenever a new way of ob
taining information is made avail
able to a community, the Career 
Center shouldnt refrain from hold
ing these orientation sessions. But, 
making them mandatory is taking 
it a bit too far.
Also, not everyone begins his or 
her job or internship search upon 
arrival to campus, therefore, it is 
possible that there are some stu
dents who are still not aware that 
they must attend a TartanTRAK 
meeting to prepare for their up
coming career decisions. So far, 
the advertising that the Career 
Center has done for TartanTRAK
consists of one letter sent to stu
dents home addresses and an up
date on their Web page. These 
methods of advertising are not 
effective enough and will surely 
result in some students failing to 
attend training sessions because 
they do not understand they are 
required. If the Career Center 
had made more of an effort to 
inform students of the 
TartanTRAK importance  via 
posters, campus mail, departmen
tal mailboxes, and advertisements 
placed in eating areas  it would 
be easier to deal with the manda
tory sessions. Buthow can students 
be expected to attend something 
they never knew was required?
With other community improve
ments such as 0LR, a pilot pro
gram was tested to gauge student 
reaction. Despite this extra step 
in the planning process, there 
were still many problems with 
the system. But the Career Cen
ter didnt even bother to solicit 
student opinions, and therefore 
should expect problems that man
datory attendance at a training 
session simply cannot rectify.
The Career Center deserves 
credit for updating its job track
ing system to accommodate a 
modern campus community such 
as CMU. But requiring students 
to attend a training session to 
learn a skill they already possess 
is unnecessary. If the Career Cen
ter wants to succeed in updating 
its operations, it needs to take a 
better look at the students whom 
it serves.

Student calls for 
end to blackouts
Editor:
Carnegie Mellon 
University is one of the 
leading technological 
learning centers in the 
entire world, yet it 
cannot power our mi
crowaves. Imagine, twenty minutes be
fore your next class starts, your home
work is just about finished printing, 
and lunch is nearly cooked. Then  
utter silence. This scenario is not un
common in Scobell.
On the night of August 31st, a ninehour blackout paralyzed the first floor of
Letter to 
the Editor
the Scobell House. We are keeping score 
now. This is the seventh outage Scobell 
has experienced within the past two 
weeks. The electric technicians are ar
riving later and later each time a call is 
put in. Perhaps we should anticipate an 
outage before it actually occurs, then by 
the time we lose the electricity, the tech
nicians will be well on their way.
The explanation for the outages is that 
there is too much current being drawn 
through the electrical wires. God forbid 
 we may never see power again if CMU 
ever issues the Micro-fridges to Scobells 
eagerly awaiting residents. Is it too much 
to ask for a continuous supply of electric
ity in our dormitory rooms, or that 
Carnegie Mellon would ever be punctual 
in correcting problems when they occur?
Understandably, it is not practical to 
rewire the building at this time, but this 
is a serious issue that needs to be ad
dressed. Whether Housing would be will
ing to install a generator, furnish power 
backup batteries (UPSs), temporarily 
run extension cords from the other side 
of the hall, or more simply give the RA a 
key to the circuit breaker box, some
thing must be done.
This is an unacceptable quality of 
living for the amount of money that 
Carnegie Mellon students have 
paid. We, the residents of Scobell, 
demand better.

Tobacco debate goes up in smoke
Nick Fox-Gieg
What happened to the wave 
of anti-smoking sentiment 
that was supposed to be sweep
ing the country? Not too long 
ago, Joe Camels billboards 
were, being painted over, to
bacco CEOs were being called 
before investigative commit
tees, and grumbling references 
to Prohibition began cropping 
up in the media as Clinton 
heartily endorsed the proceed
ings. Normally complacent 
legislators offered up batches 
of laws to increase taxes on 
cigarettes, tightly control tobacco advertising, further 
restrict public smoking, and 
hold tobacco companies liable 
for deaths linked to smokingrelated illnesses. From all in
dications, however, these iniworded bill after another.
Part of this loss of momen
tum is due to the fact that the 
arguments brought to bear in 
the debate are highly complex, 
which makes them easy to chalAttempts to drag the moral and 
legal implications of smoking 
into the matter are essentially 
diversionary tactics. 
tiatives have foundered; mas
sive campaign contributions 
from the industry and flag
ging popular interest have 
helped to kill off one boldly

Please see TOBACCO, page 9Market decline does not justify worry
Dash Boyer-Olson
The U.S. stock market has dropped 
over 15 percent from the record highs 
established earlier this summer. Last 
week, events in Russia triggered more 
declines in the major market indices, 
and the market has continued its drop 
since that point.
Undoubtedly, many people find them
selves panicking about a number of is
sues regarding this significant market 
downturn. First and foremost, people 
want to know whether their money is 
safe in the stock market. Next, they 
might wonder why the market responded 
so strongly to the turmoil in Russia. 
Finally, many students looking for jobs 
in the near future might worry that the 
job opportunities will dry up.
When the stock market goes down 
significantly, people inevitably worry 
about their money and consider taking 
it out of the market. While it is human 
nature to think about pulling money 
out, people must remember that mar
kets do go down. Perhaps U.S. investors 
have been spoiled by the bull market of 
the past 6 years and think that the 
market should always go up. However, 
the market is inherently risky; if it 
werent risky, it would not generate the 
handsome returns that it does.
So should people run to take their 
money out of the market based on the 
declines of the last month? The answer 
for most people should be a resounding 
No. The only investors who should 
take money out are those who might 
actually need the money in a reasonably 
short time frame  say, less than 10

years. The market is too uncertain for 
investors who have plans for their in
vestment money in the near future.
However, the declines of the last 
monthdo not cause this uncertainty; 
the market is uncertain whether it is 
going up or down. While it might drop
viciously at times, investors that pull 
their money out almost inevitably 
miss the gains when the market re
bounds. Over the long run, the stock 
market historically outperforms 
other investments.
Some people might be wondering why 
Russias problems caused the market to 
fall so much. After all, Russias economy 
is incredibly small compared to the U.S. 
economy. In addition, U.S. companies 
dont depend on Russia for very much 
revenue, so one would not expect the 
market to react so negatively. Maybe 
investors are worried about the uncer
tainty regarding the future political stat$ 
in Russia? Or maybe they reacted to the 
massive losses that U.S. banks suffered, 
due to Russias collapse?
The reason for the drop isnt exactly 
clear, but it was probably the result 
of many insecurities that investors had 
about the market in addition to 
concerns about Russian turmoil, includ
ing the Asian Crisis, declining corporate 
earnings, and Latin Americas 
current problems.
Little has actually changed in the U.S., 
but international problems hurt the 
stock market because the U.S. is now 
part of a global economy. The success of 
many U.S. companies is affected by the 
happenings in other countries, as large

Columnists compute implications of research
Study discounts potential of Internet
Open Forum
by Abhay Agrawal
! The Internet is a relatively new tech
nology, yet its growing at exponential 
rates. Unsurprisingly, along with bring
ing many benefits, it introduces issues 
and problems. The CMU-based HomeNet 
study, whose results were published in 
this months The American Psycholo
gist, is the first study to look specifically 
at the impact that the Internet is having 
over time on the social involvement and 
psychological well-being of Americans. 
The findings present a gloomy picture  
extensive use of the Internet leads to 
sadness, loneliness, and depression. 
Internet users must understand the com
plexity of the issue before reacting to 
this information.
To begin with, the study is the first of 
jts kind. Investigating a new phenom
enon takes time, data, and experience. 
As more data is collected, one can make 
better decisions as to the credibility of 
the study. We must not cry wolf without 
really knowing the whole issue.
Furthermore, the HomeNet project 
looked only at a very small set of pos
sible Internet effects. It did not investi
gate whether the Internet provides job
relevant skills for people, gives them 
useful information for work or school, 
allows them to organize their home lives 
or purchases more efficiently, improves 
their self-esteem, or has other compen
sating benefits. It is possible that once 
all the factors are considered, itll turn 
out that the Internets positive sides far 
outweigh its negative effects.
Also, the study suggested that it is 
easier to get on to the Internet than to 
have real-life social interactions with 
people, and that this makes people anti
social. The fact is that, for many people, 
the Internet serves as the only avenue 
for meeting people with a common in
terest or need. This is especially impor
tant in small communities which arent 
large enough to sustain a support group. 
For example, living in rural Montana or 
Kansas, it would be difficult to find a
panic disorder support group. The people 
who have Internet access could get con
nected with people like themselves and 
get advice. And what about countries 
where there might not be support groups 
for things which we take for granted in 
America? Many Asian countries have no 
support groups for minority communities 
such as the gay, lesbian, and 
transgendered people. For people belong
ing to those communities, the Internet is 
a powerful tool for bonding.
Another problem is that it is hard to 
predict how general these results are. 
HomeNet only studied 169 computer us
ers in Pittsburgh. Its very difficult to 
make an accurate generalization based on 
such a small 
number of users 
in a particular 
part of the coun
try. How would 
the results play 
out with more 
socially isolated 
people, people 
using different 
services, or 
people in differ
ent parts of the 
country?
Also, we dont 
really under
stand the 
mechanisms 
that produce the 
negative effects, 
even in the
sample that was studied. One must un
derstand both the limits of the results and 
the mechanisms behind them before de
signing solutions or making policy recom
mendations, says Robert Kraut, the lead 
researcher of the study. The study has so 
far not been replicated and it is to be seen 
whether this will happen in the future.
While the HomeNet study is brilliant 
and exciting, we must beware of absolute 
characterizations of the Internet as so
cially good or bad. The Internet is di
verse, and it is changing rapidly. Any de
bates or policies must take this into ac
count. We must fully understand the situ
ation and strike a balance between time 
spent on the Internet and time spent offline.

Isolation effect explains life at CMU
Open Forum
by Rebecca Fribush
Recently a team of Carnegie Mellon 
researchers released the results of their 
HomeNet study, in which they gave a 
bunch of Pittsburgh households free 
Internet access for a couple of years in 
exchange for making them fill out ques
tionnaires. They discovered that the more 
time people 
spend online, 
the more iso
lated, stressed, 
and lonely they 
become.
This is sur
prising how? 
Gee, the researchers 
could have 
come to ex
actly the same 
conclusion, 
without 
nearly as 
much time 
and expense, 
simply by 
spending a bit 
Matt Blum/Tartan Art Staff oftime observ
ing the CMU campus. The write-up of 
the results, published in this months 
issue of The American Psychologist, says 
that spending lots and lots of time online 
gets people out of the habit of having 
actual social interaction with actual hu
mans. Anyone at CMU whos ever had a 
zehyr conversation with their roommate
 while they were both in the same room
 will recognize the scary truth of 
this statement.
CMUs dependence on the Internet 
goes far beyond a too-intense reliance on 
zephyr for every communication need. 
Were used to going online to find any 
kind of information we might want, from 
notes for a class to a friends phone 
number. This reliance on online infor
mation obviously isnt just a CMU phe
nomenon, but the ease of ethernet and 
the fact that we have a computer cluster
roughly every 10 feet combine to make 
online binging even more tempting for CMU 
students. This accessibility is convenient, 
but it isolates us even more. You can stay 
put in the cluster or in your comfy IKEA 
swivel chair while you keep track of the 
weather, Boris Yeltsins adventures with 
the steadily declining ruble, or the 
latest twists and turns of your floormates 
love lives.
CMU culture is a cybervoyeurs dream 
come true. Want to learn more about that 
cute guy at the workstation behind you in 
your Operating Systems recitation? Fin
ger him. His planfile is sure to be full of 
useful quotes and information, designed to 
let you feel like you know him without even 
having taken the trouble to exchange pleas
antries about how late each of you stayed 
up the night before. Odds are that he also 
has a home page, so you can spend all the 
time you want reading his bad poetry and 
looking at pictures of his three-year-old 
self in the bathtub. If youre so inclined, 
you can also subscribe to a couple of graffiti 
boards  CMU bulletin boards that any
one can create whenever the mood strikes 
 and read on as people rant about their 
problems, without the least obligation to 
comfort them or offer your support.
The authors contend that, besides draw
ing people away from human contact, the 
Internet is also a giant time suck. So the 
more time you spend online, the less time 
you have to do everything else. And the 
more stressed you get. Which certainly 
makes sense. But Im having a hard time 
really giving this point the attention it 
deserves  I spent five hours last night 
online reading back issues of The Onion 
and am now somehow finding myself with 
a mountain of homework to get done.
In fact, the HomeNet results do a great 
job of explaining the CMU universe. They 
should perhaps be distributed to first-year 
students upon arrival, along with The Word 
and the ugly class t-shirts, so that they all 
know what theyre getting into. 
Although they might have a better chance 
of actually reading it if they got to find it on 
the Web.

Clearly, investors must now 
concern themselves with both 
foreign and domestic events 
as international problems 
increasingly influence the 
U.S. markets.
Touching closer to home is 
the effect that the stock market 
fall might have on students 
looking for jobs. If the stock 
market were to crash, the job 
market would certainly look a 
lot worse to graduating seniors. 
However, the U.S. job market 
is currently strong, as is the 
U.S. economy. So most seniors 
probably dont have to worry 
too much about how the stock
market might hurt their job 
search. The financial services 
industry will be hit harder than 
other industries if the market 
falls a great deal, which would 
be bad news for me, a finance 
major. However, theres prob
ably just as much chance that 
the market will go up as go 
down in the coming months, so 
Tm not going to lose any sleep 
over it; Better to just accept 
the stock market for the un

manufacturers? Somewhere 
alongthe line, these two separate 
issues have become confused, and 
the core of the controversy has 
been largely forgotten.
Remember what originally trig
gered the sudden upswing of pub
lic interest? Four years ago, a

Papers, they provided substan

companies were not only fully 
aware of the long-term effects of 
their products, but were also de
liberately adding new and harm
ful substances to their tobacco, 
increasing its addictive properties as well as the damage it did 
to the body.
The issue raised by those docu
ments is a straightforward prob
lem of product safety. The health 
risks posed by smoking and the 
extent to which the government 
should intervene to prevent be
haviors that society judges to be 
self-destructive are vital and im
portant topics for debate. Yet 
theyre utterly irrelevant to the 
question at hand: were danger

commercial goods, with the full 
knowledge of the manufacturers, 
and was the fact of their exist

The luck ran out for CMU, however.

The Tartans took that score into halftime, snuffing out a late Denison drive 
with a Chris Schmitt interception.
The second half belonged to the Tar
tans. The defense did not allow an
other point in regulation, and the of
fense began to move the ball with 
more consistency. On their second and 
third drives, the Tartans moved the 
ball with relative ease, driving both
times inside the Denison 15-yard 
line. But that, success moving the 
football was empty, as both drives 
slipped away without points, lost to 
untimely fumbles.
That last fumble pinned Denison 
down on their ten yard line and would 
actually lead to CMU points. On sec

interception 17 yards for a touch

game was knotted 14-14 and headed 
for overtime.

ensuing extra point by Matt Jarock was 
blocked, and Denison stole the game 
21-20 overtime.
Hopefully the ball bounces right a

Seniors Kristo Kriechbaum and Josh

Bryan Meyer took the top four spots, 
finishing within 10 seconds of each other. 
In addition, CMU took the next three 
spots as well, and the first Cal State 
runner didnt finish until eighth place.
Meckley was especially encouraged 
and impressed with first-year student
career. Im really encouraged by our 
young guys, said Meckley.
Next week, the team will travel with a 
partial squad to the California State 
Invitational. Meckley will rest his top 
five runners, entering the race, with a B 
team. Its really hard to run hard every 
weekend, and I think its best if our top 
men sat out one, he said.
Despite the overwhelming success, 
Meckley takes a cautious approach to the 
rest of the season. Well have to see what 
happens when school really gets started 
and the guys have projects and papers 
and tests to do, he said. Im extremely 
happy with our times now, though.

team had been 
started by their

and they were 
used to a casual, 
informal game.
The different 
styles quickly led 
to conflict, as 
Huck U. grew 
tired of Pitts 
chippy play and 
use of picks. They 
retaliated by call
ing fouls, which 
only served to 
raise the tension 
level between the 
teams. The Pitt 
players soon be
came very tired of 
CMU making foul 
calls, hampering 
what they consid
ered their fun 
style of play.

out the next game. That game was Saturdays 
game against Mount Union College. Last 
year when the teams met, CMU beat them 
4-0. This year the team was hoping to earn 
a win, but a slow start proved enough to 
prevent victory.
We got behind 2-0. They scored in the 
first half when we were a little tentative, 
said coach Nick Gaudioso.
Mount Unions second goal came early in 
the second half when a Tartan player 
misplayed the ball and ended up scoring on 
his own goal. By that time, the Tartans 
were in sync with each other and dominat
ing the game, but scoring proved to be a 
difficult thing.
Finally a handball in the box gave CMU a 
penalty kick, and senior co-captain Harry 
Ulrich was able to put the ball away, closing 
the gap to 2-1. Unfortunately, it was the last 
goal of the game.
We proceeded to kill them. We just couldnt 
put the ball in the back of the net, said 
Gaudioso. We had at least six shots that 
could have gone in. Its just so hard to score 
when youre behind.
In an effort to find a more offensive forma
tion, a few players will be shuffled in the 
upcoming games. Senior co-captain Dan 
Brody will be moved to outside halfback 
where Gaudioso hopes Brody will be able to 
use his ability to move the ball up the field, 
provide some crosses and earn some corner 
kicks for Carnegie Mellon. Freshman Steve 
Tepper will be moved to one of the middle 
halfback spots where Gaudioso feels Tepper 
will be more comfortable and his skills will 
be put to better use.
On Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon will play 
Penn State-Behrend at home. Last year Penn 
State-Behrend was able to get the better of 
the Tartans in a 1-0 game. Carnegie Mellon
Penn State-Behrend Wednesday after failing to contain Point Park last week.
will be hoping to add a notch to its win 
column and forget about the last week.
I told the kids we just have to stay 
positive, said Gaudioso. Everyone has
to stay positive. It just doesnt get 
any easier. We used to be able to 
count on five or six wins easy. Now 
the level of play is higher.

According to Moss, other keys to the 
Tartans success are their depth and 
youth. This was particularly evident 
in the singles matches. Veterans Mills 
and Balch faltered, both losing their 
respective matches narrowly despite 
strong performances. Chanopis shined 
through, though, taking her match 
after being down 5-2 in the second 
set. In addition, Palermo bounced back 
from a doubles loss to win convinc
ingly in singles play 6-0 and 6-3. 
Brown capped off an impressive and 
undefeated day with a hard-fought 
win in three sets  6-1, 2-6, and 6-4.
In addition to getting a great start on 
the season, the Grove City match also 
reinforced another of Moss keys to suc
cess  everyone must contribute for the 
team to be successful. With the victories 
by Chanopis, Palermo, and Chiu, along 
with a strong showing by senior Whitney 
Brooks, the team has proven that every
one can win.
Team contributions will be especially 
important when facing off against Uni
versity Athletic Association (UAA) comSophomore Elisabeth Brown reaches for
petition like Emory and the University 
of Rochester. Moss believes that if they 
stay healthy and everyone contributes, 
the team can finish in the top four of the 
UAA and go far in the region.
This week, the team is gearing up for a 
doubleheader against Chatham College

and NCAA Division II Shippensburgh. 
Their first UAA match of the year will 
follow that against Rochester.
Shippensburgh will be a good gauge 
for our team, said Moss. It will also 
serve as a great warmup for our next 
match against Rochester.

Football loses to Denison in OT

The football office was somber this Sunday after 
the 21-20 overtime loss to Denison. Coach Rich

Last season, CMU ran over Denison 32-7, but this year they were grounded in an overtime loss.
Theofline owned the4ine of-'scrimmage, and the 
backfield of juniors Mike Campie and Mike 
Monsilovich and senior Bryan Krueger was running 
at will. With four downs and only two yards to goal, 
a touchdown seemed imminent. But on first down, 
when a missed exchange on a routine handoff left 
the ball bouncing on the Denison doorstep, that 
unlucky fumble rolled back into Denisons hands.
Two possessions later, Denison made its drive. 
Starting at its own 20, a flurry of short
quickly moved it into Tartan territory. A personal 
foul against the Carnegie Mellon defense kept its 
drive alive. A few plays later, Denisons Jay Boyd 
turned a short swing pass into seven yard touch
down, shaking off Tartan defenders.
Three possessions later, in the second quarter, 
Denison had the ball again and scored. Dan Hayes, 
a Denison wide receiver, caught a five-yard out and 
ran for 19 more, break
ing tackles on the way 
to his 24-yard touch
down reception.
Carnegie Mellon, who 
had the opportunity to
score first, now found themselves down 14-0 in the 
second quarter, but the resilient Tartans would 
fight back. On the ensuing kickoff, Monsilovich 
answered with a huge return, running the ball down 
to the Tartan 44-yard line. Sparked by the big 
return, the offensive line reclaimed the point of 
attack, prying open huge holes in the Denison de
fense. Russ Clay balanced the rushing attack with a 
couple of completions to Chris Barnicle and

Women play to mixed resultsMen stall in opening games

The womens soccer team 
, opened the season strongly 
with a win last Wednesday, 
only to see two tough teams at 
the Allegheny Tournament 
score a combined nine goals 
and only allow two from the 
, Tartans last weekend.
The teams first game was 
played on the road at Mount 
Union College. The Tartans 
started the game well, and only 
, 12 minutes into the first half 
junior Jocelyn Pollack took a 
, shot on net that was bobbled by 
t the Mount Union goalie, then 
. put into the net by first-year 
student Marcy Cook.
Thats the best part of the 
game, when they score early, 
said senior co-captain and 
goalie Lindsay Smith. I think 
when we score its more of a 
team effort.
The team started the second 
half as prodigiously as the first. 
First-year student Gwyneth 
Gaul intercepted a ball that 
was misplayed by the Mount 
Union defense and took a shot 
from the outside that passed 
i just under the crossbar for the 
Tartans second goal.
All of the players who trav
eled with the team got playing 
time. Coach Heather Kendra 
was pleased with the victory 
and the depth that the bench 
. , was able to provide in the game.
Last weekends games proved 
to be a more difficult test of the 
teams improvement over the 
last year.
Were playing some really 
good teams, said junior mid
fielder Courtney Marrett. So it 
will give us a chance to measure 
ourselves and see how weve im
proved over last year.
On Saturday the team took on 
Kalamazoo for the first game of 
the two-game Allegheny tourna
ment. The first half went rela
tively well for the team. At the 
end of the first 45 minutes 
Carnegie Mellon had held 
Kalamazoo to a 2-1 lead with the 
help of a penalty kick from Gaul.
We were playing with them, 
said Kendra. We were holding 
them and it was nice to see... . 
Kalamazoo just never stoped 
coming at us and we broke down 
a little.
Throughout the game the Tar
tans were out-shot 23-11 and 
Smith was forced to make 15 
saves. Sophomore Christy Kelly 
scored a goal late in the second

The season got off to a rough 
start for the Carnegie Mellon 
mens soccer team as they lost 
their first two games of the 
season in disappointing fash
ion. Both losses were close and 
more a product of slow starts 
and mental errors than their 
opponents outplaying them.
In last Wednesdays home 
game against Point Park Col
lege, the team was still rusty 
from having only two weeks to 
prepare for the season. This, 
and the fast play of the turf 
caused the most trouble for the 
Tartans in their own end early 
in the match as they lost their 
shape defensively on a few fast 
breaks from Point Park.
For 15 minutes, the Tartans 
struggled to get into a rhythm
before Point Park earned a free 
kick 25 yards away from 
Carnegie Mellons goal and to its 
right side. CMU established a 
wall to protect against a direct 
shot; however, Point Park took a 
low, hard shot to the far post 
that beat the outstretched hands 
of goalie Ben Kartzman.
Down 1-0 after the goal, 
Carnegie Mellon continued to 
struggle and gave up another 
opportunity to Point Park a 
few minutes later. By the end 
of the first half, the team was 
playing more consistently and 
kept the ball in the Point Park 
end for longer stretches of time 
but failed to generate real scor
ing opportunities.
The second half produced more 
chances for the Tartans, but ev
ery shot was too wide or too high, 
and the team couldnt find the 
back of the net.
With 20 minutes left, the ref
eree-stopped the game for a hurt 
player while the ball was in 
CMUs end of the field. Point 
Park restarted the ball to the 
left of CMUs goal. This time 
Point Park passed the ball off of 
the free kick, but then shot from 
the outside. An unmarked Point 
Park player deflected the ball 
into the goal.
The 2-0 lead for Point Park 
stuck; despite their efforts, the 
Tartans couldnt close the gap. 
The final blow of the game came 
with 15 minutes left when junior 
Sharif Siddiqui was red-carded 
for complaining about the delay 
tactics of the Point Park goalie.
The red card in the Point Park 
game meant that Siddiqui had 
to both leave that game and sit

I think were a much stron
ger team this year than last. 
Those were the words of 
womens tennis coach Pete Moss 
last Thursday while watching 
his team face off at home against 
Grove City. Mosss words were 
then reinforced as the Tartans 
defeated Grove City 5-4 in the 
teams first match of the year.
This years team is anchored 
by senior three-time All-Ameri
can Keri Mills and sophomore 
Elisabeth Brown. Both Mills 
and Brown were hampered by 
injury last season but are 
healthy this season and in good 
playing shape. It is great that 
Keri and Elisabeth are healthy 
this year, said Moss, who places 
much of the teams hopes on the
shoulders of these veterans. It 
is great for team morale that we 
can have all of our players 
healthy and contributing, espe
cially the veterans and leaders. 
The younger players then have 
someone to look up to.
The match started with the 
doubles, where much of the 
teams strength lies. Mills and 
Brown played against Grove 
Citys first team. Senior Julie 
Balch and first-year student Jill 
Palermo comprised Carnegie 
Mellons second doubles team, 
while first-year student Kelly 
Chanopis and sophomore Jes
sica Chiu rounded out the 
doubles. The Tartans prevailed, 
taking two of the three matches. 
Mills and Brown won 8-6, and 
Chanopis and Chiu defeated 
their Grove City foes 8-2.

people together, not necessarily to 
run all out.... [It] was very encour
aging because we were able to keep 
a group of six people together for 
most of the race, meaning we have 
a good chance at scoring well in the 
upcoming meets.
Those six runners were Powers, 
McGranaghan, juniors Amy Antoci and 
Andrea Byrnes, first-year student 
Brook Cutler, and first-year student 
Kelly Chin. They all came in ahead of 
the competition last Saturday.
Our home course is always the slow
est course we run all season. Every
one should expect a good deal of im
provement, said Powers.
Coach Donatelli was also upbeat 
about the race and the teams pros
pects for the season. This is prob
ably the deepest team weve had, 
said Donatelli. This is probably 
the best top seven runners Ive had. 
Ill definitely take my chances with 
this team.

is ultimate frisbee. The team is Carnegie

With names like Small Ass Truck and 
the Steel Panthers, five teams from three 
local schools took the field last Saturday 
as the CMU Ultimate Frisbee Club held

Dont let the names deceive you 
though, for the level of play on Satur
day was anything but juvenile. CMU 
has a long history of success. The Mr. 
Yuk club dates back to 1979 and fea
tures a third-place national finish 10 
years ago. Duquesne and Pitt have not 
had such storied histories, but they 
were talented and enthusiastic foes for 
Mr. Yuk nonetheless.

With elections just two months away, political campaigns are 
kicking into high gear across the country The national buzz 
may have you itching to get involved, too.
If so, there are plenty of politically and socially active orga
nizations on campus. One such organization is Earth, which is 
the only group on campus wholly dedicated to environmental 
issues, according to president Elin Warn, a senior environmen
tal science major.
The group takes a local perspective on environmental issues. 
We find that its most effective to focus our energy on campus
 on recycling and waste issues, said Warn.
For example, this year the Schatz Dining Room in the 
University Center has switched from reusable ceramic dishes 
and silverware to styrofoam plates, cups, and plasticware.
Were hoping to get on that as soon as possible, said Warn. 
The best well probably get is paper products instead of plas
tic, but its a start.
Wed also like to see recycling get good publicity this year, 
to increase participation by students and employees, said 
Warn. Depending on the size [of the group], wed like to get 
really active.
Among the more traditionally political organizations is the 
CMU College Republicans. Their chairman, Peter Deluca, a 
senior mechanical engineering major, was a student who saw 
apathy at CMU and sought to change it.
The club was inactive when I came here, said Deluca. It 
took me about a year to get interested in politics and to ... 
restart the club. Last year I became chairman.
Our main thing wed like to work on [this year] is a Reagan 
birthday party, he said. Hopefully well bring in a few big 
names to talk about the 80s and Reagans administration.
Wed also like to get into some community service  
maybe working in a food bank, said Deluca. The Republicans 
hope to get more speakers on campus this year, probably 
Republican politicians in the area. Our main goal is to 
advertise and educate the [campus] community in Republican 
values. Expect to see the College Republicans staging a few 
mock protests or taking the fence again this year to advertise 
their cause.
The Objectivist Club is getting an early start on advertising 
their philosophy. You may have already seen the Who is John 
Galt? posters around campus. John Galt is the hero of the novel 
Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivist philoso
phy. This years club president, Jason Crawford, a sophomore

Many Americans recall 1968 
as a difficult year  assassina
tions, rioting, and the nation 
split between supporters and 
opponents of the Vietnam War. 
Nowhere was this more evident 
than on college campuses, where 
these two groups frequently 
clashed with each other and 
administrators while trying to 
express their opinions.
Thirty years later, the level of 
campus activism has declined 
significantly. Many people look 
at this fact and question the 
political interest of students 
today. In order to understand the 
situation better, it is important 
to first ask students and profes
sors from many different areas 
what they think politics is.
Politics is really about the 
functioning of government and 
the decisions governments 
make about social and economic 
issues, said Silvia Borzutzky, 
professor of social and decision 
sciences at CMU.
Borzutzkys analytical defini
tion is based on the work she 
has done in her field of political 
science. This does not necessari
ly mean that this is the correct 
definition, however. The simple 
question of What is politics? 
brought up many other different 
answers and went well beyond 
Borzutzkys textbook explana
tion. The interpretation of poli
tics is varied among CMU stu
dents since they come from 
different backgrounds. Each 
response is unique and based on 
the individuals perspective and 
experience with the subject.
For example, the definition of 
politics to Charles Lan, a sopho
more information and decision 
systems major, includes a differ
ent angle toward government.
[Politics] is learning to use the 
relationship between the public 
and the government to either 
achieve goals or make changes to 
the country, said Lan.
Many CMU students replies 
tended to revolve around this 
similar theme of politics as a 
two-way process. Sophomore 
music major Katherine Dresler 
summed this theme up by call
ing politics a relationship 
between people and power.
These definitions raise ques
tions about the role of politics on 
the college campus. The majori
ty of the responses suggested 
that it should play an active role 
in the experience of college stu
dents, especially if it is to follow 
the dialogue process described 
by many students.
According to this process, 
while the governing bodies cre
ate and implement all of the 
decisions, it is also necessary for 
students to complement the dia
logue and give feedback when 
necessary so that important 
changes can be made. Has this 
process been successful at CMU?
I dont see too many people 
here interested in running for 
student government... but when 
I talk to people from other 
schools, theyre really into it, 
said Rodrigo Canelas, a senior 
art major.
Even the least educated per
son [at CMU] knows what Bill 
Clinton has been doing recently, 
but some of the most educated
dont even know who their 
Senator in the Student Senate 
is, said Dipesh Mukerji, a 
sophomore information and 
decision systems major.
Not only is the lack, of 
involvement in campus-wide 
politics a common remark, but 
many students believe that 
there is a very limited amount 
of interest in national and 
international issues.
[CMU students] are either 
very active and vocal or really 
dont care at all, said Paluzzi.
Based on these statements 
and the viewpoints of many 
other students, it seems that 
politics at CMU is not following
the objective set forth by stu
dents. The process is mostly 
one-way, as students tend to be 
unresponsive to current events 
and fail to complete the relation
ship between the governing and 
the governed.
There have been several dif
ferent theories that try to 
explain the lack of political 
interest and action at CMU and 
other college campuses. One of 
these theories involves todays 
news headlines. History profes
sor Erick Langer believes the 
nature of current national and 
international events is often 
unappealing to students.
I dontthink that its an 
apolitical age; theres just 
no big issue right now that 
riles up students anymore, 
like the Vietnam War or even
apartheid, said Langer. Since 
we have an all-voluntary mili
tary force, student emotions 
about wars in faraway places 
like Bosnia are mute.
Other people, such as civil and 
environmental engineering pro
fessor James Garrett, think that 
politics is simply a turn off for 
many students.
One of the problems is the 
way politics is being practiced 
today, including all the mudslinging and intense media cov
erage.... It really dissuades a lot 
of people from getting involved, 
said Garrett.
A frequently used theory to 
explain the lack of student polit
ical action at CMU involves time
 there is little interest in cur
rent affairs because many stu
dents simply feel that they have 
no time for it.
It just seems like people are 
too busy with their work, said 
Stuart Hayes, a sophomore 
mechanical engineering major. 
It seems like were isolated 
from the world because we 
make ourselves isolated.
The exact reason why there is 
a lack of student involvement on 
campus is probably due to a com
bination of these theories. 
Nevertheless, there is a common 
sentiment that CMU is generally 
lacking in political participation.
Administrators and student 
leaders frequently try to address 
this sentiment to help students 
become more informed of local 
and global issues. There is a dif
ferent attitude, though, as the 
administration feels that stu
dent action is not in a bad state.
On campus, I think students 
are considerably more active 
than 30 years ago, which has 
had an enormously beneficial 
impact on campus policies and 
priorities, said Michael Murphy,

Enjoy it while it lasts...
keep rolling through Year 2000CMU will
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
[Editors note: This article is the second 
of two parts examining the Year 2000 
problem and its impact on CMU. Last 
weeks edition defined Y2K and touched 
on how it would affect campus computing; 
this week's article looks in detail at what 
the CMU community can do to prepare for 
the turn of the millenium.]
It is 479 days until January 1, 2000. 
Do you know where your computer 
will be?
If youre like most students and fac
ulty, you probably dont. Although 
Carnegie Mellons administration has 
been rooting out possible Y2K compli
ance issues for the past several 
months, the systems receiving most of 
the attention are ones crucial to the 
Universitys operation.
Luckily, the picture for CMU com
puting in the year 2000 is relatively 
bright. According to CMUs Y2K 
Implementation Planning Team, CMU 
has tested and fixed about 80 percent 
of its administrative programs written
in the COBOL programming language 
and about 70 percent of proprietary 
systems written in other languages. 
Additionally, most of CMUs Category 
A systems  systems required by safe
ty codes, such as emergency power 
generators, carbon dioxide detectors, 
and climate control systems  have 
already been tested. So far, the only 
system with serious Y2K compliance 
issues is the central fire alarm moni
toring system, which is being replaced.
The planning team, which is respon
sible for creating CMUs compliance 
plan, estimates that total University 
compliance will cost about $5.4 mil
lion. While the team expects that indi
vidual departments will be able to 
absorb this cost in their regular oper
ating budgets over the next year and a 
half  in the 1997 fiscal year, CMU 
spent a total of $26 million on comput
ing and technology purchases  it 
doesnt address the problems that indi
vidual students might face when the 
calendar turns to 2000.
Students can take several steps to 
make sure their desktop systems are 
Y2K compliant. First, they can do a
preliminary survey of their computers 
software to see whether their individ
ual computer programs will be able to 
handle the switch to 2000. For exam
ple, the Macintosh and Mac OS are 
Y2K compliant: the original Macintosh 
128K computer introduced in 1984 can 
handle all dates until 6:28:15 am on 
February 6, 2040. The current Mac OS 
can handle dates well past the life of its 
hardware components, but rest assured 
that if your Mac could run for the next
27,000 years, it would be able to handle 
dates well into the 300th century. 
Additionally, most Windows operating 
systems are Y2K compliant, although 
users may need to download patches to 
bring certain versions up to snuff.
Intel-based PCs are potentially more 
problematic than . Macintoshes. 
Although the major operating systems 
on the market (particularly those that 
students commonly use) are Y2K com
pliant, Intel-based systems can have a 
huge variety of BIOS chips from 
machine to machine. The BIOS regu
lates the computers internal clock; if 
the BIOS cannot handle Y2K, the sys
tem will likely have problems. In some
cases the BIOS can be reset once after 
2000 and the system will function prop
erly; in others, the system may crash 
entirely. Contacting the BIOS manu
facturer is the best way to determinp 
BIOS compatibility.
While many common desktop projgrams (such as those from Microsofjt 
and Adobe) are either compliant or will 
be compliant in new versions scheduled 
for release before 2000, custom pro
grams that dont properly deal with 
dates can damage data. For example, 
spreadsheets and database files that 
store the year in a two-digit format can 
potentially cause problems for students 
who perform date-based calculations in 
their research, homework, and person
al file storage. Since it is possible to 
store years with four digits in common 
programs like FileMaker and Microsoft 
Excel, the easiest way to prevent prob
lems is for students to convert date for
mats from mm/dd/yy to mm/dd/yyyy.
For additional assistance in testing 
their systems, students can contact 
CMUs Computer Maintenance Group 
by email at repair@andrew.cmu.edu or 
by phone at x8-2661.
Director looks to fun side of research
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Features Editor
As the new director of the 
Undergraduate Research Initiative, 
Janet Stocks is looking forward to com
bining the two things she likes to work 
with the most  research and students
 into one job. After hearing of her 
appointment, The Tartan caught up 
with Stocks to find out what got her 
interested in the position and what 
direction she thinks undergraduate 
research is taking at CMU.
The Tartan: What made you decide 
to get involved with undergraduate 
research at CMU?
Janet Stocks: My last job was in the 
Center for Integrated Study of the. 
Human Dimensions of Global Change 
in the Engineering and Public Policy 
Department. This was an interdiscipli
nary, international group composed of 
about 35 researchers. I worked mostly 
with professors and principal investi
gators from all over the world who 
were involved in research.
I had started to think recently about 
what work Ive liked most in my life. 
Before starting my graduate work, I 
worked for the residence life and hous
ing office at Oberlin College. I loved that 
job  I loved working with students  
but the reason I left was that I was liv
ing in the dorms. I still liked the work, 
but I got sick of living in [the dorms].
TT: You characterize 
research as play. 
Can you elaborate 
on that?
JS: Well, its serious, 
too.... Research is fun 
because you get to 
define a question  
youre interested in 
finding something 
and want to know 
more about it. I cant 
think of anything 
more fun than that. 
Its also really hard 
work, but its good to 
see what the mix of 
fun and hard work 
in research is. For 
example, in graduate 
school, one of the 
main things you do is 
research; its impor
tant to have a good 
idea of what it is. 
Even in the work 
world, many projects 
take an approach 
very similar to 
research.
The results of the 
I really think that research is a lot of project are interesting, but the process

Janet Stocks is particularly interested in interdisciplinary 
research and research in the arts.
fun. At a university like CMU, its good 
to have research be something that stu
dents get to play in. The Undergraduate 
Research Initiative is a great program, 
and Im glad to be a part of it.
of knowing what its like is more impor
tant than any one research project.
TT: What do you think about the 
Undergraduate Research Initiative as 
it is now?
JS: Its amazing. Jesse [Ramey], who 
basically created the program, did an 
amazing job. I actually feel slightly 
intimidated about following in her 
footsteps because she did such a won
derful job.
Im not planning any major changes 
to the program; Ill be lucky if, in the 
next six to nine months, I can learn as 
much as I can about the position. One 
of the first things Ill do is make 
appointments with people around cam
pus to find out in what ways people 
think the program can grow.
TT: Are there any specific research 
areas or topics youre particularly 
interested in?
JS: I learned a lot about natural sci
ence in the past few years; Im also 
interested to know what goes on in 
research in the arts. Im particularly 
interested in interdisciplinary work - 
putting together unusual sets of disci
plines that you might not think would 
fit together. That way, students trained 
in different ways could learn from each 
other through the project.
Thats why my experience in EPP 
was so valuable  I learned an incred
ible amount from my peers. In inter
disciplinary research, you have stu
dents learning from one another as 
well as learning from faculty. As we get 
more socialized and more educated, we 
get to break down the walls and see 
that people think in different ways 
than we do.

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  8 September 1998L3
Political organizations announce fall activities
GROUPS, from page LI
computer science major, describes the 
groups philosophy in a nutshell. 
Objectivism, in short, upholds reason 
 as the only means to knowledge, ratio
nal selfishness as a moral principle, and 
laissez-faire capitalism as the only 
means for government.
On September 30, the club is spon
soring Dr. Harry Binswanger in a talk 
called Bridging the Is-Ought Gap: 
How to Derive Morality From Facts.
Historically, philosophers have 
accepted that there is a gap between is 
and ought  between facts and val
ues, said Crawford. Ayn Rand created 
a morality which bridges that gap. 
While the groups focus is Objectivist 
philosophy, they encourage debate. 
Some of our most active members are 
not Objectivists, but theyre interested 
in the discussion, said Crawford.
Other activist groups on campus 
include Amnesty International, known
for their annual kidnapping of a 
noted professor to publicize human 
rights injustices around the world.
The CMU Libertarians have also 
grown in the past year and have been 
promoting their ideas in opposition to 
those of the Republicans. According to 
Deluca, the Republicans are hopeful 
that a debate with the Libertarians will 
occur sometime this year.
Finally, there are the campus govern
mental organizations, such as Student
Senate. These organizations give stu
dents the chance to voice their opinions 
about issues local to CMU.
[Senate] meets with administrators 
regularly so we can let them know 
whats going on, said Sarah Gross, a 
junior social and decision sciences major 
and student body president. So if stu
dents would like them to hear about 
something, they can let us know. Theres 
all different kinds of councils so specific 
issues can be addressed to the appropriate council. Gross also noted that 
Senate will try to have town meetings 
this year to facilitate communications 
between students and administration.
Thus there are a variety of activist 
organizations on campus, and all of 
them need students to help promote 
their cause.
What we can do depends on our 
membership this year, said Warn. The 
members we have want to do more, but 
we need more people to do more things.Lack of issues leads to apathy among students
POLITICS, from page LI
dean of Student Affairs. 
Students have created entries 
into decision-making at almost 
all levels of participation.
This opposes the view that 
students are unresponsive to 
campus issues. The administra
tion also has a different view 
regarding activism on national 
and international affairs. 
Provost Paul Christiano believes 
that creating a major debate is 
not necessarily a good thing.
[35 years ago], students 
talked about apathy on campus. 
That came to an end with the 
Vietnam conflict which tore up 
the college campus for 10 years, 
said Christiano. If you think 
that was exciting, it wasnt. It 
was dreadful for students, facul
ty, and administration.
In the case of national and 
international affairs, it seems 
that the lack of a major conflict 
is the dominant reason for the 
lack of activism on campus. 
Christiano noted that students 
were detecting political apathy 
in the early 1960s as well. That 
problem was not resolved until 
there was a problem of such 
magnitude as Vietnam.
I think there is interest, but 
there is not the binding national 
agenda such as civil rights or 
the Vietnam War, said Murphy. 
That is not to minimize current 
issues, including civil rights and 
warfare anywhere, but the 
majority of national focus seems 
* to be on economic issues, which 
may be somewhat less com
pelling for students.
The issue of politics at the 
local level is confusing since 
administrators and students 
disagree over the current state 
of the process. The administra
tion feels that students have 
been more responsive to 
University policy, but students 
do not think that there is 
enough interest and action from 
classmates over these issues. 
Clearly, communication between 
the two groups has improved, 
but there is still a lot left on stu
dents minds which needs to be 
expressed and addressed.
There are some places at CMU 
where the two-way political 
process is being practiced. The 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) seeks student input 
which is given readily, according 
to president Robert Migliore.
I think its hard for students 
to get a perspective on what 
SDC does, said Migliore, a 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering major. Sometimes 
its hard for a student to give us 
feedback when they dont have a 
big picture [of SDC].
In response to this, SDC, along 
with administrators, went to the 
dormitories to speak with stu
dents and give them an opportu
nity to address any concerns or 
ideas they may have. This was 
an effective way to communicate, 
and it is a model of the student 
theory of politics. It is impossi
ble, however, for such meetings 
to take place all the time.
A problem arises when stu
dents still do not communicate 
all problems to the administra
tion. Such a situation creates an 
environment where students 
feel that change is hopeless. If 
this happens, politics will forev
er remain a one-way affair.
But if students raise their 
voices and the administration 
makes it clear that there are 
channels where students can do 
so, there should be no reason for 
anyone to use the phrase stu
dent apathy at CMU.

It's what all the 
kids are doing.

From top: 1. Gray is the color of choice this fall. Designers are using 
detailed knits with soft textures, as in this sweater by Limited. 2. 
Cargo pants are one of the biggest sellers in the country right now, 
and they are expected to continue on that same trend. Fit anything 
and everything in the pockets. Khaki is the color most often seen, 
but also look out for black, olive drab, or even navy blue. Pants by 
Goodwill. 3. British shoe designer John Fluevogestablished himself 
as a staple of urban footwear. Look for Fleuvog's trademark chunky 
soles and slick, off-color stripes. Shoes by Fleuvog.
This city is definitely not New York or LA. But 
Pittsburgh fashion has plenty to offer. Where? Try 
these club havens and super-posh boutiques.

Tartan Sports Co-Editor
I f youre like me, then your
I morning ritual doesnt in 
I elude much thought about 
the fashion implications of what 
you pull out of your clothes 
drawer. There just isnt time 
for those types of consider
ations if you want to get to 
your 8:30 class on time.
That isnt to say that I dress 
like a slob. I dont think I 
do anyway.
I would guess that most 
guys feel this way. Then 
again, most people think 
they are good drivers, and 
all it takes is a few blocks 
of driving in Pittsburgh to 
realize that there is no way 
this could be possible.
For me, the most important 
consideration with clothes is 
that they are comfortable. 
When I buy clothes, I try to pick 
things that look nice. But I dont 
need them to be the latest in 
whats fashionable, the most 
trendy brand, or the newest look 
that the Gap is trying to sell me 
on television.
I wear my clothes into the 
ground. The sneakers I wear on 
most days now were purchased 
in my sophomore year of high
school. I have 
shirts from even before that. Then 
again, I am just one person. One 
person, even myself, can hardly 
be a cross sampling of society. 
Lets get some other male opin
ions on fashion. Finding guys with 
opinions shouldnt be tough on 
this campus.
I suppose dressing well shows 
the type of person you are, said
CIT first-year student Shing Tai 
Leung. It shows a persons char
acter. You should choose your 
clothes well.
This isnt a good sign for me. 
Lets ask someone else how much 
they value looking good.
On a scale of 1 to 10, maybe 
8.5, said sophomore busi
ness administration major 
Maurice Parent. If you 
feel like looking good and 
have the means to do it, 
then you should.
More bad news. 
Maybe someone else 
can put a different spin 
on it. I think its im
portant to feel good 
about how you look, said 
sophomore civil and en
vironmental engineering 
major Mose Jones-Yellin. 
For those of you keeping 
score, it looks like so far we 
have determined that its im
portant to look good if you want 
to, but its also important to be 
comfortable, and not just from 
the standpoint of chaffing. But 
lets be honest here. There are 
times when the look is more 
important than the feel. When 
you want to look good  lets 
say for a date, or a party, or 
something formal  does fashPlease see MENSWEAR, page L8
Open your wallet, shell out some cash. 
That's right, blow it all on clothes. We know 
you will. Yeah, right. But ii you do, let us 
give you a hand with this list of essential 
items for the season.

ogue says its best to own 
something gray this fall. 
The raver kid who lives next 
door says that the new thing this 
season is jeans with 60-inch bot
toms. The poster in the Gap 
says its high time everybody 
wore pants with carpenters 
loops. If were at all con
scious of what we wear 
each day, we listen to 
what the experts have 
to say. Pittsburgh has 
its own fashion ex
perts, and the stores 
that accompany that 
expertise. From 
clubwear to designer 
wear, theres a place 
to get it and some
body with a comment 
on it.
But dont expect 
too much out of 
Pittsburghs fashion 
havens  those stores 
where we can find the 
latest looks  location 
has a lot to do with it.
American fashion designers, 
streetwise or haute couture, 
tend to congregate in Los Ange
les and New York. Pittsburgh, with 
its near-midwest vantage point, just 
doesnt get the newest fashions as soon as 
theyre on the market.
According to Bagel (yes, thats his real 
name), the general manager at Oaklands 
Avalon, this location point is true for most 
of the country.
Everywhere from Pittsburgh to maybe Ari
zona, the location is usually about two-and-onehalf to three seasons behind New York and LA, 
said Bagel. Like camoflauge. Camoflauge came 
out in New York and L.A. in around 92, It didnt 
catch up here until about 96.
Avalon is one store that specializes in urban 
gear, clubwear, and anything you cant get in 
the mall. One trend out of New York that is 
just recently catching on here is pants that are 
cut tighter and made of dark, indigo denim.
Although Avalon still carries jeans with 
those 60-inch bottoms, commonly seen at 
clubs and raves or used for skateboarding 
and made by companies like Jnco or 
Kikwear, Bagel said that those pants with a 
tighter cut and stiffer denim have become a 
big item.
[That cut] is a response to the baggy 
clothing thats dominated fashion for 
the last eight years or so, he said. 
Designers are going in a differ
ent direction.
Some students are mystified 
by this new style of jeans, 
advertised by Levis as 
Hard Jeans, for ex
ample. The idea of hard 
jeans is sort of stupid, 
said Adam Gerard, a 
sophomore business administration major. 
Jeans should be loose 
and comfortable. 
Other students agree 
that formfitting jeans 
havent quite made 
their way onto campus 
yet. Ive noticed a lot of 
guys with really, really, 
wide leg jeans, said Katie 
Tarana, a first-year H&SS 
student, They are almost like 
a dress, only split.
Another new direction comes 
from the reemergence of swing. 
Avalon, and other stores around the 
city, such as South Sides Revolutions 
and Slacker, sell some of the items that go 
along with the swinging mystique. For 
women, designers are producing 50s-inspired bowling shirts and capri pants, which 
are cut tight, with a mid-calf length. For 
men, in conjunction with the rockabilly 
stylings, the swing movement inspires dePlease see GEAR, page L9

Aimee Bender's Girl in the Flammable Skirt is a collection of magical realist" fiction.
Surrealism
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Forum Editor
Theres an old couple in Aimee B enders 
first collection of short stories, The Girl 
in the Flammable Skirt, who both dream 
the same dreams. Every day, they sit 
outside their house together, call[ing] 
out images from the night before to all 
passersby. Like the old couple, Benders 
stories coinhabit the world of dreams 
and that of reality. Bender conjures up a 
universe in which boyfriends go through 
reverse evolution until they become tiny 
salamanders, and mermaids put on long 
skirts, stuff their tails into big boots to 
hide them, and go off to high school. In 
the hands of a weaker writer, elements 
such as these could degenerate into cloy
ing whimsy, but she handles them well. 
Her earthy details and carefully dry 
tone keep the stories entertaining and 
persuade you to suspend your disbelief.
Benders style probably falls best un
der the category of magical realism. At 
times, her imagination in thinking up 
strange fates to befall her characters 
and her matter-of-fact narration of all 
this weirdness is reminiscent of such 
masters as Gabriel Garcia Marquez. But, 
she has a voice all her own.
The protagonist of The Healer has 
two strange classmates  one girl with 
a hand made of fire and one whose hand 
is made of ice. In this story, like the 
others, Bender maintains her deadpan 
tone no matter how unusual are the 
things shes describing: During science 
class that fall, the fire girl burnt things 
with her fingers. She entered the room 
with a pile of dry leaves in her book bag 
and by the time the bell rang, there was 
ash all over her desk. She seemed to 
need to do this. It prevented some poten
tial friendships, however, because most 
people were too scared to approach her. 
Even the few stories which could con
ceivably happen have surreal, and some
times erotic, twists. Quiet Please fea
tures a librarian who decides that the 
way to grieve for her recently deceased 
father is to lead every man who 
approches her library desk to a sofa in a 
back room, where she proceeds to have 
sex with him. Her final conquest is a
circus strongman who lifts up both her 
and the couch and parades them around 
the library. Bender is certainly capable 
of stunningly vivid images. In The Ring, 
a robber and his new bride break into a 
wealthy couples house several times, 
and keep finding rings in the canisters of 
dry goods. In the salt, the narrator dis
covers a ring with an emerald the color 
of grass seen by someone with green 
eyes. The robber couple also steals a 
ruby ring which leaks redness. When 
they go on vacation in Tahiti, it slips off 
the wifes hand and turns the whole 
ocean red.
A couple of times, Bender overreaches 
and her stories dont quite work out. In 
Marzipan, not only does the narrators
father wake up one morning with a soc
cer-ball-sized hole in his stomach, but 
her pregnant mother gives birth to tier 
grandmother. One of these misfortunes 
could have made an interesting story, 
but both within the space of 15 pages 
makes the whole thing seem overdone. 
At times, she also uses self-consciously 
poetic turns of phrase. The narrator, of 
The Rememberer, who keeps liter 
steadily de-evolving boyfriend in a pjan 
full of salt water, drip[s] tears into $ie 
pan, a sea of me.
But, for the most part, Benders stories 
make for very entertaining reading, full of 
subtle writing and powerful images. The 
Girl in the Flammable Skirt is the kind of 
book a reader dreams about finding.
Men determine fashion 
through comfort levels
MENSWEAR, from page L7
ion gain importance for everyone 
then?
A suit has to have style, said sopho
more drama major Andrew Palmer. 
A suit has to be trendy. Thats the 
only current stuff I would look at.
I dont really own any suits, but I do 
notice when someone is wearing 
one that is out of style. I would imag
ine that at parties people pay more 
attention to not only what they wear, 
but what other people are wear
ing. Lets face it, we are all 
searching for attention 
in one form 
or another.
It depends on 
my mood, said 
Leung. If I feel 
good, I dress 
well. I defi
nitely dress 
up [to go 
out].
I think that 
we have to 
step back for a 
minute 
though. When 
men pull clothes 
out of the closet, 
it isnt a random 
event, even if we are 
more unconscious 
than not. Guys go shop
ping. They make decisions 
about where to shop and what to buy. 
So how much energy goes into that?
[Clothes] have to be comfortable, 
said Palmer. I dont care where I 
shop. Sometimes I go to Goodwill  I 
dont have to go to the Gap to get my 
clothes. When I go to buy jeans I just 
buy whatever is on sale.
Fair enough. Im the proud owner of 
not one piece of clothing from the Gap.
I pretty much walk in, see what I 
like, and get it, said Jones-Yellin. I 
usually know what I want in the first
five seconds after going in. I dont like 
shopping with other people because I 
just end up watching them try 
on clothes.
I can relate to all of that. Im not 
too interested in watching anyone 
try on three different styles of jeans, 
or shirts or anything. Im more 
likely to entertain myself by count
ing the change in the mails 
fountains.
I like to try things on, said Par
ent. It has to look right and feel 
right. I can try things on two or 
three times and if I dont like it I put 
it back.
Okay. Im confused now. Maybe 
some guys do like to shop. I can live 
with that. But whats the underlying 
theme here? There has to be one. It 
could be just as simple as we all want 
to look good, but if we dont have time 
in the morning  whatever.

The Apostle
Does anyone remember that really cheesy Steve 
Martin movie called Leap of Faith? In it, Martin 
stars as a con artist evangelist named Jonas Night
ingale, whose tour bus breaks down in a small town 
and as he tries to woo disbelieving waitress Lolita 
Davidovich, he realizes what a scumbag he really is. 
Well, this movie is sort of like that. Except much, 
much better. Robert Duvall received an Oscar nomi
nation for best actor for his role as a preacher whose 
assault on his wifes lover forces him to leave his 
home and family. He then travels to a small town 
where he regains his faith and becomes a successful 
evangelist. You know, Im from a small town and I 
dont recall hearing of one religious epiphany the 
entire 15 years I lived there. Maybe I just wasnt 
paying attention.

Fear and Loathing in Las 
Vegas
I absolutely loved this movie. I was telling friends 
about it two weeks after I saw it. I felt that no one but 
Terry Gilliam could have directed this adaptation of 
Hunter S. Thompsons road trippy novel about 
searching for the American dream on heavy narcot
ics in early 70s Las Vegas. I thought Johnny Depp 
was uncannily accurate as Thompsons alter ego, 
Raul Duke, and Benicio Del Toro was hysterical as 
his Samoan attorney. I thought the characters came 
to life right off the page, and scenes that I never 
imagined could be translated into film were seam-less. But apparently the rest of the world disagreed 
!lwith me. They just thought it sucked. Go see it and 
. decide for yourself.

Titanic
Oh, come on people. Come out from under your

dollars and broken world records in video sales. 
Theres a For Dummies book about it. For Gods 
sake, people in Tanzania have seen it. You have to 
know something about it. No? OKfine. Titanic is the 
reason that prepubescent girls have put millions of 
their hard earned babysitting dollars towards 
Leonardo DiCaprio paraphernalia, leaving a mo
ment of uncertainty for the future of IN SYNC and 
the Backstreet Boys. Oh, and James Cameron can

Gates of Hell
This movie has been distributed under several 
different titles since its initial release in 1980. 
Throughout the years, besides the title Gates of 
Hell, its been know as:
Paura Nella Citta Dei Morti Viventi 
City of the Living Dead 
Fear in the City of the Living Dead 
The Fear
Twilight of the Dead
Whats in a name? Well, lets see. Im thinking that 
this movie takes place in a city, where for some 
reason the gates of hell have opened up spewing 
forth the living dead, and that seems to be causing 
some fear in said city, for those who are still among 
the living. But Im guessing not for long. Oh, and Id 
wager its Italian. Yup, definitely Italian.

dada
dada  MCA
On their self-titled fourth album, dada 
provides much of the same punchy rock and 
roll and clever wordplay as before, managing 
to tackle a number of different sounds 
throughout 13 tracks. The music is standard 
guitar-bass-drums rock and roll, but the 
band adds a few touches like a drum-andbass style intro on Information Undertow 
and some strategically deployed strings on 
Spinning My Wheels.
Although dada plays around with some 
tricky verses, the themes are relatively easy 
to pick out. Far from a concept album, each 
song centers around a particular theme, like
0
lost love or the search for identity. Unlike, say, 
Radiohead, most of the lyrics require little 
interpretation, sometimes detracting from 
their inventiveness. In addition, the slick 
production of the disc removes some of the 
albums emotional potential. The band is aided, 
though, by its knack for choosing music that 
fits with and compliments a particular song. 
Acoustic guitar adorns contemplative songs 
like Outside while dadas cover of Wars 
Low Rider is filtered not so subtly into their 
west coast homage, California Gold. Dada 
has certainly found its niche this time out 
writing clear, concise tunes without 
adhering to any preconceived notion of 
what they should sound like.

Baxter
Baxter Maverick
All music gravitates toward a center point: 
mainstream acceptance. Swedish group 
Baxters self-titled debut is an excellent ex
ample of this phenomenon. Toning down the 
often staccato bursts of drum and bass and 
melding them with female vocals, the band 
has created a relaxing album with tradicourtesy Maverick
tional song structures. Baxter may not be 
the most original idea in concept, but its 
pleasant to listen to on lonely days.
Vocalist Nina Ramsby is the force that 
carries the beats and pulses along, crooning 
of love and loss. Though she closely re
sembles Beth Gibbons of Portishead on many 
tracks, thats not a bad thing. On Fading, 
her words wrap around the listener; snip
pets of her ethereal lyrics linger, even though 
its hard to understand what the song 
is about.
The music varies from orchestrated strings 
to rapid drum work and occasional guitar 
riffs. Baxter must have worked hard on the 
instrumentation found on its debut, but what 
remains after a few listens, more than any
thing else, is a distinctive mood and a few 
lyrical pieces.  DAVE ELMANLocal stores gear up for fall season
GEAR, from L7
signers to experiment with retro 
prints. We see shirts scattered 
with fuzzy dice, or printed to look 
like faux leopard skin.
If youre looking for something 
besides retro or club gear, but 
still fashionable, this city has 
plenty of places to check. Some 
even carry merchandise by de
signers considered to be the classi
est in the fashion industry.
According to Pittsburghs high 
fashion shops, Vogue had it right 
 gray is this seasons primary 
color. Add in extra texture to ev
ery piece, lots of detail, longer 
lengths, a little fur trim, and 
youve got a good idea of whats 
going on in the ultra high-class 
world of fashion.
Designers like Dolce & 
Gabbana, Donna Karan, Hugo 
Boss, and Vivienne Westwood are 
all producing extensive uses for 
the color gray this season. For 
women, the changes from last 
season also come in skirts and 
coats that hang longer, and the 
use of synthetic fur-trim on ev
erything from sweaters to scarves 
to outerwear. In footwear, we see 
a shorter heel, but dont worry, 
were not completely away from 
the platform yet.
Platforms, or just clunky 
shoes, are still popular on cam
pus. However, a smaller heel is 
becoming more stylish. I like 
clunky shoes, said first-year psy
chology major Amber Geyer. But 
not necessarily Spice Girl height.
Marta Minic, owner of 
Shady sides Maxalto, which car
ries a mix of big-name European 
and American designers, said 
that for women, accessories are 
getting bigger and longer.
[Designers are making] duffle 
bag-style bags, as opposed to 
shorter straps, and chunkier jew
elry, she said. No more Y neck
laces, or anything small with 
semi-precious stones.

sential item is a gray cashmere 
sweater. At Shadysides Moda,

Although all these styles 
havent fully arrived on campus 
yet, store owners hope you find 
yourself reaching for a pair of 
form fitting jeans and a gray 
sweater when its time to put the 
tank tops away.
Even though designers some 
clothes indicate otherwise, many 
students still are certain that 
comfort is the most important 
thing for fall wardrobes.

Apartment fire raises 
concerns for students
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
Last Friday night at 10 pm, 
firefighters filled the fourth floor 
hallways of Cathedral Mansions. 
By the end of the night they had 
extinguished a small fire in room 
422. Howver, questions about 
the cause of the fire and why the 
buildings fire alarm system did 
not activate even after 91 was 
called remain unanswered.
Jamar Powers, the desk atten
dant on duty at Cathedral Man
sions last Friday, said that at 
about 9:55 pm, he received a call 
from a resident stating that the 
fire alarm for room 422, a Carn
egie Mellon apartment, was ring
ing. When Powers went up to the 
room, smoke was pouring from
under the door. No one responded 
when he knocked.
. Powers then returned to the 
front desk where he placed a call 
to 911. Four fire trucks responded 
to the call. Firefighters asked resi- dents in neighboring apartments 
to leave the building while they 
dealt with the fire. However, they 
did not activate the building 
alarm, which had failed to acti
vate on its own.
The firemen decided that it 
was not an emergency situation, 
said junior mechanical engineer
ing major Ken Gould, a fourthfloor resident and the commu
nity advisor for Cathedral Man
sions. There was no immediate 
threat. The officer just advised 
that students open windows and 
ventilate the area.
My personal mental state was 
like it wasnt happening, said 
senior voice major Jennifer 
Manvich, a fifth floor resident. I 
guess I refused to believe there 
was a fire in the building.
I was concerned about all the 
stuff in my room, said freshamn 
mechanical engineering major 
Doug Carrol, a fourth-floor resi
dent. The actual fire alarm didnt 
go off for some reason; I dont 
know why. [But] I saw smoke on 
the fourth floor.
Other students didnt even 
realize that there had been a 
fire. Sophomore art major 
Laura Porter didnt return 
home until 1 am. I dont even 
know about it. I just saw the 
red hose [in the hallway].

President addresses staff concerns
Tony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
President Cohon spoke with a staff member last Wednesday.
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
Most students at Carnegie Mellon might 
not give much thought to the staff that helps 
make up the foundation of this University. 
Last Wednesday at noon, President Cohon 
showed that he is both aware of and inter
ested in solving staff problems. Carnegie 
Mellon staff members gave up their lunch 
hour to sit and stand in the aisles of McConomy Auditorium to hear Cohon respond to 
issues that they brought to him as individu
als and through Staff Council.
He certainly covered all of the questions 
we had, said Staff Council President and. 
EPP staff member Denise Murrin-Macey. I 
feel that President Cohon wants a greater
involvement from the staff than we have 
had in past administrations. We are very 
happy that he made the point that he would 
be looking at issues simultaneously with 
Staff Council.
Cohon began his speech with the issue of 
staff development. Staff development is part 
of-the Universitys strategic planning pro
cess. Cohon stressed that staff would be 
involved in the process of creating the staff 
development program and assured the audi
ence that he was sensitive to the issue of 
performance evaluation. Cohon shied away 
from endorsing a University-wide standard 
and instead stressed that whatever pro
gram is adopted must be based on results 
and outcomes. He explained that it must 
also address the needs of the University.
Staff development is not controversial, but 
its expensive, and its complicated, said Cohon. 
You have to tune it to the needs of the staff. 
Cohon also addressed staff benefits, tax 
deductions, and the Child Care Center. An 
issue related to the Child Care Center is the 
proposed new dorm that would displace the 
playground currently located between 
Morewood Gardens and Mudge House. Cohon 
said that currently the University has no 
plans to move ahead with a dorm on that site.
Cohon shared a laugh with the staff over a 
request to have individuals birthdays added 
as personal holidays, a request he denied. 
The humor was used to transition into the 
more controversial issue of same-sex domes
tic partner benefits.

By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Ah, parties. They are a part of college 
life. A chance to relax, socialize, meet 
new people, and dull your senses. But 
for the permanent residents on Beeler 
Street, they are a nightmare.
There was a party last year where 
there was a guy tearing outside, run
ning around nude in the front yard, 
said Charles Hirsh, a resident of Beeler 
Street for 27 years.
Permanent residents on Beeler Street, 
most of whom are non-students, have 
identified CMUs party-goers as the 
source of their troubles. They feel they 
have dealt with the noise and drunk 
students long enough and have decided 
to do something about it  even though
most students living on the street are 
unaware of their complaints.
Mr. Hirsh and his wife Elissa have 
headed a movement to address several of 
the issues that the permanent residents 
on Beeler Street have been dealing with. 
Last summer they held a street meeting 
to talk about some of these issues. Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy, As
sociate Dean of Student Affairs Paul 
Fowler, and City Councilman Dan Cohen 
were in attendance. Another meeting will 
be held in October.
We got eveiyone on this street together 
to talk about what they thought were the 
' major problems, said Mrs. Hirsh. We 
determined that the Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, their parties, and their drunken
ness are the number one problems.
I think it is clear that the vast major
ity of students living on Beeler and else
where are good neighbors and good com
munity members, said Murphy. It is 
sad that a few students do not act re
sponsibly and reflect poorly on the ma
jority of students and the University. 
The other permanent residents com
plained about problems, including high 
noise levels, public urination, and de
struction of property. At the last party 
. [at our next-door neighbors house] in 
May, there were two paddywagons and 
four police cars that showed up, said Mr. 
Hirsh. The kids ran over and destroyed 
everyones hedges. A few hundred kids 
poured out of this place, and this must 
have been at three in the morning. 
According to the Hirshes, those in 
attendance at the meeting determined 
Please see BEELER, page 3Former student killed in train accident
By BECKY A. COWSER
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Kenton William Shaver, a CMU alum
nus, sustained fatal injuries last Thurs
day when he fell off a moving Amtrak 
train in the Sierra Nevada mountain 
range. He passed away two days later at 
Washoe Medical Center in Reno, Nevada.
Shaver, who suffered from blindness 
and deafness, graduated from Carngie 
Mellon last winter and recieved his di
ploma last spring with a B.S. in techni
cal writing. He was 27.
He was the model of perserverance. 
He stuck at it  you would think that a 
person would give up, but he just showed 
everyone that our problems are kind of 
small, said Everett Tademy, director 
of CMUs Equal Opportunity Services. 
Its a shock. He just graduated, and I 
thought that things would blossom a 
little bit for him.
According to Tademy, it took Shaver 
about seven years to work his way 
through CMU. His many disabilities
made everyday tasks such as classes 
and talking to professors difficult. Shaver 
employed the help of a translator who 
would use sign language to convey what 
a professor was teaching. He also had 
student volunteers like Lauren Garcia 
who took class notes for him.
He impressed me so much, especially 
by choosing writing as his field, said 
Garcia, a senior English major. I just 
remember thinking, Wow. With every
thing we go through at school its diffi
cult, but for him to have that added 
pressure  he was amazing.
Shaver attended Alderdice High School 
before coming to Carnegie Mellon. Ac
cording to Tademy, the majority of 
Shavers disabilities, including his deaf
ness and blindmess, resulted from an 
accident he had while still in high school.
Despite his difficulty working through 
school, Shaver participated in extracur
ricular activities at CMU. He wrote a 
column for The Tartan entitled Focused 
on the Internet. He also contributed to 
his community, according to Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Murphy.
One thing that was very special about 
[Shaver] was the community service 
work that he did, said Murphy. Given 
all the other constraints on his time, 
that he did community service is a great 
testament to his character.
While communicating with Shaver could 
be difficult, it could also be rewarding. I 
remember one time he came into my office 
without his interpreter, said Jim Daniels, 
head ofthe Creative Writing Department. 
We had to type back and forth on the 
computer to talk.... I saved those notes 
because I thought we really connected. 
Whenever a student dies, its incred
ibly sad, said Daniels. But its particu
larly sad when I think about [Shaver] 
and all he had to go through to get 
through school.
Shavers disabilities made him prone 
to balance problems, but Nevada police 
said that an investigation is under way 
to determine if foul play was involved in 
Shavers death. No funeral plans have 
been announced.
Student Senate moves 
along despite vacancies
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Contributing Editor
As Student Senate begins its policy 
making for the year ahead, empty seats 
are greeting the returning senators. 
Of the 42 senator positions, 13 are 
vacant to begin the fall term.
Two spring seats and 11 fall seats are 
open currently. A fall seat is one which 
is up for reelection later this semester 
and a spring seat is up for reelection 
next semester. According to Jamie 
Chang, a senior biology major and the 
Senates Human Resources chair, hav
ing a number of vacant seats has not 
been unusual during the last few years, 
but vacancies have not been the norm in 
the longer term. He attributed the va
cancies to students still adapting to the 
new structure of Student Government 
and having trouble knowing ifthey want 
to participate in government.
The positions are open for a number 
of reasons* A GSIAseat is open because 
the Senator transferred to another Uni
versity. Senators in CFA and CIT re
signed because of time commitments.
Some Senators even graduated. Other 
Senate seats were never filled.
David Liu, a sophomore social and 
decisions sciences major who was 
elected as Senator for H&SS last se
mester, resigned this semester after he 
learned he had a class conflict with 
Senate meetings. I knew Id love the 
job, the responsibility, and the oppor
tunity to serve my college; my heart 
was in it, said Liu. Unfortunately, 
when the time of the Senate Meetings 
was announced, I knew things werent 
going to be easy. Liu was offered alter
natives to remedy the situation, but he 
rejected all of them because he did not 
think he would be giving his college the 
attention it deserved.
Even with four empty H&SS seats, 
Liu insists representation in the col
lege is still strong because the remain
ing Senators 'are very active in various 
committees. While there is no college 
that is not represented presently in 
Senate, some are obviously less repre
sented than others. In addition to the 
foui empty seats in H&SS and CFA,

White House responds 
to Starrs allegations
WASHINGTON (AP) - Given a day 
to absorb Kenneth Starrs graphic re
port, the White House struck back 
Saturday with a rebuttal assailing the 
prosecutors conclusions as a hit-andrun smear campaign. Lawmakers 
spoke cautiously of impeachment as 
they gauged public reaction back home.
It is plain that sex is precisely 
what this four-and-a-half year inves
tigation has boiled down to, the White 
House argued in its second counter 
report in two days.
In Atlanta, House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich said the lurid nature of the 
report was unfortunate but caused by 
the presidents denial of a sexual rela
tionship with former White House in
tern Monica Lewinsky. He called on 
lawmakers to reserve judgment.
I think you cannot render ... any 
judgment until you have given the 
president a chance to respond and 
given the Judiciary Committee a 
chance to do its job, Gingrich said.
Clinton, in his weekly radio address, 
noted it had been an exhausting and 
difficult week in the capital  not only 
for me, but for many others. Without a 
mention of the Starr report, he pledged 
to press ahead with his policy agenda.
The most important thing to do 
now is to stay focused on the issues the 
American people sent us here to deal 
with, from health care to the economy 
to terrorism, Clinton said.
Presidential aides, relieved there 
were no new bombshells in the Starr 
report, launched the second offensive 
to encourage Democrats to stand be
hind the President and to ridicule the 
report as tawdry. It marked the start 
of a passionate effort by Clinton to 
argue against removal from office  
one that will for the short term seek to 
paint Starr as a misguided, sex-ob
sessed prosecutor.
Starrs allegations in the Monica 
Lewinsky matter are simply part of a 
hit-and-run smear campaign, and their 
inclusion says volumes about the 
[prosecutors] tactics and objectives,
the White House charged in its 42- 
page response.
The referral is so loaded with irrel
evant and unnecessary graphic and 
salacious allegations that only one con
clusion is possible: its principal pur
pose is to damage the President, the 
rebuttal added.
While President Clintons actions 
were wrong, the acts described by pros
ecutors do not even approach the Con
stitutional test of impeachment, 
Clintons White House and private 
lawyers argued. Their report provided 
a point-by-point rejection of the 11 
grounds for possible impeachment 
cited in Starrs dramatic referral to 
Congress made public Friday. Presi
dential lawyers argued that:
 Clinton didnt commit perjury by 
telling the grand juiy the term sexual 
relations did not apply to the sex acts he 
engaged in with Lewinsky. All prosecu
tors have is a witness who gave narrow 
answers to ambiguous questions, the 
White House said of the President.
 prosecutors erred in contending 
that Clinton obstructed justice by in
stigating the return of his gifts to 
Lewinsky, saying presidential secre
tary Betty Currie contradicts that daim.
 prosecutors erred in arguing 
Clinton tampered with a witness by 
summoning Currie to the White House 
in what the secretary viewed as an 
effort to get her to accept his false 
account of the Lewinsky relationship. 
The White House says it couldnt be 
tampering because she wasnt a wit
ness under subpoena at the time.
Lawmakers this weekend were home 
campaigning and listening to voters. 
The next set of jurors on the case, 
members of the House Judiciary Com
mittee charged with deciding whether 
impeachment proceedings are war
ranted, reacted cautiously.
Obviously he did something wrong, 
said Representative Thomas Barrett, 
a Wisconsin Democrat on the commit
tee. You dont violate your marriage 
promises and walk away from it.
Ketchup maker 
sells bakery unit
PITTSBURGH (AP) - H.J. Heinz 
Co. is selling its Canadian-based bak
ery products unit to The Pillsbury Co. 
for $178 million.
The Pittsburgh-based food company also 
posted a 12 percent decline in its earnings 
for the first fiscal quarter on Tuesday.
Heinz stock rose $21/2, or 4 percent, to 
$54.18 3/4 amid abroad rally on the New 
York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
Heinz Bakery Products, based in 
Mississauga, Ontario, is a $200 mil
lion business that makes unbaked fro
zen bagels and bread dough for retail, 
wholesale, and food-service outlets in 
North America.
William Johnson, Heinz president 
and chief executive, said that while the 
business has performed well, it is not 
in one of the eight core areas on which 
Heinz is focusing.
Paul Walsh, chief executive of Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, said the Heinz 
bakery division fits well with existing 
Pillsbury businesses.
In its earnings report, Heinz attrib
uted the decline to costs associated with 
Project Millennia, its reorganization and 
growth plan.
Net income dropped to $213 million, 
or 58 cents per diluted share, in the 
quarter ended July 29 from $243 mil
lion, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales were down 0.2 percent to $2,228 
billion from $2,233 billion a year ago. 
The company blamed unfavorable for
eign exchange translation rates and the 
impact of divestitures and acquisitions 
for the decline. Heinz said without those 
factors, sales were up 5 percent.
Thick dust coat 
covers Mars moon
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Phobos, the 
larger of Mars two small moons, is cov
ered in hip-deep dust formed by meteor
oid impacts over millions of years, ac
cording to images captured by the orbit
ing Mars Global Surveyor.
Some of the rocky poundings also cre
ated landslides on steep crater slopes.
Inside the bowl of a prominent 6-mile 
crater called Stickney are light and dark
streaks where debris tumbled downhill
 an indication that even with gravity 
just 1/1,000th of what is experienced on 
Earth, objects are still pulled downward. 
Large boulders more than 160 feet across 
also appear embedded in the surface.
The images and temperature read
ings released Friday by NASA research
ers help to paint a picture of what its 
like on this lumpy, potato-shaped moon.
Daytime temperatures are like those 
during a pleasant winter afternoon in 
Chicago, about 25 degrees Fahrenheit, 
while the thermometer dips at night to a 
harsh minus 170 degrees, colder than an 
Antarctic night.
Night and day switch quickly: A day 
on Phobos is just seven hours.
Researchers suspect the powder on 
Phobos to be at least 3 feet deep.
This has to be incredibly fine powder 
formed from impacts over millions of 
years, and it looks like the whole surface 
is made up of fine dust, said Philip 
Christensen of Arizona State Univer
sity, the principal investigator for the 
thermal emission spectrometer, which 
uses light to detect surface composition.
Phobos, the Greek word for fear, is 
about 16 miles wide. The other moon, 
Deimos (Greek for terror), is about 9 
miles wide.
The $250 million Mars Global Sur
veyor, launched on November 7, 1996, 
began orbiting the planet in September 
1997. It was designed to map Martian 
terrain for a Martian year, equivalent to 
687 Earth days, beginning in 1998.
The mapping mission has been pushed 
back to 1999 because of a solar panel 
problem and could be further delayed by 
concerns about the spacecrafts commu
nications antenna.
On Monday, the spacecraft is due to 
begin the second phase of aerobraking, a 
process in which it dips into the fringes of 
the Martian atmosphere to trim its ellip
tical orbit gradually and make it circular.
The spacecraft is part of a 10-year 
program of Mars exploration.
Relations break 
down in Mideast
TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  Iran will stage 
extensive military maneuvers on its bor
der with Afghanistan in a show of force 
now that the Taliban has admitted that 
its soldiers killed nine Iranian diplomats.
More than 200,000 soldiers will par
ticipate in the maneuvers, which are set 
to begin around the last week of Septem
ber, the commander of Irans ground 
forces, Brigadier General Abdolali 
Purshasb, was quoted as saying by Ira
nian television Saturday.
They will mark the second maneuvers 
in less than a month on the countrys 
rugged eastern border.
Iran vowed on Friday to avenge the 
killing of its diplomats. The Taliban, 
which controls about 90 percent of Af
ghanistan, admitted earlier that its sol
diers had killed them after taking the 
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif 
on August 8.
Iran said two other diplomats escaped, 
but their whereabouts were still un
known. The fate of a reporter for th 
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency 
remained unclear.
The ground and air maneuvers will 
take place across a 20,000-square-mile 
area stretching along Irans border with 
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Some of the 70,000 troops who com
pleted three days of military exercises in 
the beginning of September have re
mained there.
Iran supports the opposition allianc 
that was driven from its northern head
quarters in Mazar-e-Sharif. The Taliban 
have accused Iran of arming the opposi
tion, a charge Tehran denies.
Man dies while 
fighting Medicaid
NORWICH, Conn. (AP)  A man su 
fered a fatal heart attack Saturdy as he 
and hundreds of other senior citizens 
confronted insurance companies over 
plans to stop their Medicare coverage.
The death cut short a heated health care 
forum with Connecticut congressmen, so
cial service representatives, and officials 
of three insurance companies. The compar 
nies last week sent letters to 6,000 resi
dents of eastern Connecticut, saying costs 
were too high and the federal reimburse^ 
ment rate was too low to continue their 
supplemental Medicare coverage.
Fredrick Krai, 72, of East Lyme, had 
just finished denouncing the insuranc 
companies when he fell ill. Dr. Anthony 
Alessi, a panelist at the forum, attempted 
to resuscitate Krai, but he died at th 
hospital a short time later.
Americans swamp government Web sites to read Starrs report
NEW YORK (AP) - The 
Internet showed it was not quite 
ready for prime time when milions 
of people worldwide swamped 
government computers and Web 
sites in search of Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starrs report 
about President Clinton and 
Monica Lewinsky.
But by the end of the work day 
on the East Coast Friday, traffic 
seemed to have eased on the news 
sites and the report was easier to 
download on major commercial 
sites such as Yahoo! and Lycos. 
Some called it the Internets busi
est day ever.
This is the first big test of the 
Internet to distribute a lot of 
data, said Mark Simmer, a vice
president at Web directory Lycos. 
It wasnt designed as a broad
cast medium. It was designed as 
a communication medium. Its 
like everyone lifting up the same 
phone to talk to their mother on 
Mothers Day.
Possibly most telling in the 
Webs acceptance as a toddling 
mass medium was Congress 
decision to use it to distribute 
the report.
Still, there were fumbles. An 
hour after the report was released, 
the White House, Senate, and 
House Web sites were hopelessly 
snarled, as were the four other 
government sites offering it.
All across the Internet, the 
slowdown was felt. According to
the Internet Traffic Report, a Web 
site that monitors and indexes 
the Nets speed, North America 
and Europe were most affected, 
especially the areas around New 
York and Washington. Even callingunrelated Web sites was some
times sluggish.
Gene Shklar, a spokesman for 
Keynote Systems Inc., a company 
that tracks Internet performance, 
said th'? trouble was in getting 
into the sites. Once users got in, 
they usually could quickly view 
the document.
The slowdown shows the Web is 
still primitive, said Abdelsalam 
Heddaya, vice president of 
Infolibria, a maker of computers 
that move data around the Net.
Another problem, he said, is 
flash crowds  hordes of 
Internet users suddenly inter
ested in a single site. That prob
lem can only grow as more 
people come online, adding to 
the approximately 70 million 
regular Internet users in the 
United States.
As the wired population grows, 
the news sites will have trouble  
keeping up with the crowds. But 
they are trying.
The news Web site 
MSNBC.com reported 26 servers 
working at full capacity  and 
more were being installed to meet 
demand  but at times in the 
afternoon it was still inaccessible 
or slow to respond.
Once the report was posted, 
CNNs Web site was getting 
more than 400,000 hits a 
minute, said spokesman Kerrin 
Roberts. That was higher than 
the record 320,000 a minute 
August 31 when the Dow Jones 
industrial average plunged. 
To ease the crush, CNN.com 
stripped out most pictures 
and graphics to present a fastloading version.
On America Online, usage in
creased by 30 percent over the 
same time period last week.
At the Washington Posts Web 
site, Based on our bandwidth, 
weve done three times our big
gest day ever, said spokeswoman 
Erin OShea.
Traffic on The Associated Press 
Web site peaked at about 20 times 
the normal load just prior to the 
release shortly before 2 pm, said 
Ruth Gersh, editor of the APs 
multimedia services.
Still, with the cyber-rush, frus
tration was inevitable. Even tele
vision anchors had problems get
ting the report quickly. If some
body wants to step over to the fax 
machine and fax us, wed appre
ciate it, said CBS Dan Rather.
An ABC News poll taken Friday 
evening found 57 percent think 
Clinton should be impeached if he 
encouraged Lewinsky to he about 
their relationship  an increase 
of 14 points since August 21 and 6 
points since Wednesday.

50 YEARS AGO, September
29,1948  Many upperclassmen 
were wondering what became of 
the traditional freshman hand
book usually available at regis
tration. The sad truth was that 
the handbook was lost in the mail.
In the meantime, in order to 
present freshmen with the infor
mation necessary for the Tradi
tions exam, a brief substitute was 
mimeographed and made avail
able through the office of the Dean 
of Men.
25 YEARS AGO, October 2, 
1973  CMU commuters were 
upset at the City of Pittsburghs 
decision to install parking meters 
along Tech and Frew Streets.
Joseph Cosetti, City Treasurer, 
said the fact that the commuters 
and employees arrived early in 
the morning and tied up the spaces
for an eight-hour work day or a 
full day of classes was an improper 
use of on-street parking.
He said, On-street parking is 
designed for short visits. Full
time commuters and workers 
ought to use public transporta
tion. Were not very sympathetic 
to people who want to take their 
cars to work.
10 YEARS AGO, September
20,1988  Federal funds for the 
controversial Software Engineer
ing Institute emerged without a 
scratchfrom a storm of federal 
budget cuts for fiscal 1989.
Strong support by the Senate 
majority leader was largely re
sponsible for SEI keeping its fed
eral funding.
During the same week, Vincent 
Eirene gave a lecture in Baker 
Hall entitled Non-violent Con
frontation: The Disarming of 
CMU, during which he criticized 
SEIs federal funding, and he pur
ported that the institute did re
search on nuclear weapons.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Septem
ber 14, 1993  The University 
Computing Center was rechris
tened Richard M. Cyert Hall in 
honor of the Universitys sixth 
president. The ceremony was held 
in a tent between Warner Hall 
and Cyert Hall.
The building was the obvious 
choice to honor the former presi
dent, who was president of CMU 
between 1972 and 1990. He led 
CMU into the computer age in the 
early 1980s, when computer still 
meant rare mainframes. Arequest 
for a network in the Computer 
Science Department inspired his 
vision of a network that would
provide computer access for ev
eryone everywhere on campus.
ONE YEAR AGO, September 
15 1997  The student co-op on 
Margaret Morrison Street, which 
had been closed since December 
of 1996, reopened as Entropy 
East. The store provided more 
grocery items, as well as a large 
selection of microwaveable and 
frozen foods.
Some services were cut from 
those that had been available at 
the co-op, such as the labor-inten
sive deli. These cuts were made in 
order to make the store more eco
nomically feasible. However, the 
efforts were in vain, as a lack of 
student patronage forced the clos
ing of the store after last semester;

The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  14 September 19983Permanent residents seek end to disruptive parties
BEELER, from page 1
that there simply has' not been 
enough communication between 
;he residents and the students. 
Mrs. Hirsh said, Whathappened 
after this meeting was that 
people realized they needed to 
go to the students who lived near 
them, knock on the door, and 
say, Look, Id like to be helpful 
to you. Ill lend you a hammer, 
but in return Id expect you to 
ighow some respect. 
Many residents have been 
Imoving off the street, which
opens the possibility of more 
units being available for rental 
by students.
We have to worry about this 
tuminginto aSouth Oakland, said 
Mrs. Hirsh. If the value of our 
homes goes down, and we all end up 
selling, only the people who want to 
house students will own houses on 
this street. When this street goes to 
pot, it hurts everyone.
CMU has also been working on 
opening its communication lines 
with students on Beeler Street. 
Dean Murphy and two students,
who have taken an active role on 
the streets committee, have been 
working on a letter to Beeler 
Street students, detailing steps 
that they can take to be more 
neighborly and also to keep them
selves out of trouble.
Originally, this letter was to 
have been sent to students at the 
beginning of the academic year. 
It would have been helpful to 
have contact with students on 
the street by now, said Murphy. 
This was bad judgment on my 
part not to do so.
Students, the administration, 
and the permanent residents feel 
that the problems on the street 
can be resolved. It only makes 
sense that students should show 
respect for their neighbors, said 
Traber Campbell, a junior electri
cal and computer engineering 
(ECE) major and a resident of 
Beeler Street. If they do that, the 
there shouldnt be any problems. 
There was a huge party on 
Wilkins last night, said Erin Burr, 
a junior ECE major living on 
Beeler Street. Sure, parties with
400 people are great to talk about 
the next day, but they dont be
long in a residential setting. One 
ofthe nicestthings aboutBeeler is 
that it is close to campus, and yet 
is a complete escape from campus.
I can come home after school, re
lax on my porch, and forget about 
the day for a while.
My overall impression is that 
the neighbors and students rec
ognize that Beeler is a special 
residential area, for students and 
non-students, said Murphy. All 
of us, including students on the
street, need to be a little more 
active in pushing back when stu
dents act in a way which is inap
propriate or illegal.
Mr. Hirsh said that he enjoys 
living on a street with such a mix 
of people. We love it now when 
the kids are back, he said, and 
theres so much vitality on the 
street. But he also added, John 
Stuart Mill said, Tour rights end 
where mine begin, and when kids 
start infringing on our rights and 
our neighbors rights, then the 
kids are wrong.
CMU Center tests new 
TA evaluation options
By JENNY GARCIA de OSUNA
WTartan Contributing Editor
We may soon be seeing marked im
provements in the quality of teaching 
assistants through efforts being made 
developing TA evaluations and a new 
book available to assist TAs.
The Eberly Center for Teaching Ex
cellence is currently in the process of 
developing new evaluations for teach
ing assistants. In the past, the Faculty 
Course Evaluations have been the only 
source of feedback departments and 
professors have had from students. 
However, it is clear that the role TAs 
have in the classroom is highly impor
tant. TAs have a lot of contact with 
students during recitations, labs, and 
discussion sections. In large first-year 
; lecture courses, many times TAs have a 
larger impact in students understand
ing of the material than the professors 
because of their ability to obtain a 
: greater teacher-to-student ratio.
The reason we are doing this is that 
i we would like to provide information to 
make TAs into better teachers, said 
Dr. Rebecca Freeland, associate direc
tor of the Eberly Center. Thats our 
primary goal.
There are two types of evaluations in 
progress. The early evaluation form is 
meant to be distributed sometime dur
ing the first six weeks of a full-semester 
course. These early evaluations allow 
TAs to make changes in their method of 
teaching early in the course. The sec
ond type is the end-of-the-course evalu
ation, where feedback at the end of the 
semester is used to further improve 
TAs future teaching skills and to allow 
the departments to monitor their 
courses and academic programs.
This program is not just [the Eberly 
Center] saying that TAs need help; we 
have gotten a lot of feedback along the 
way and hope to make improvements in 
the quality of our courses, said Freeland.
The evaluations have not yet been 
officially implemented into courses. At 
this point, weve conducted two small 
pilot studies, and we are currently ana
lyzing the data and getting feedback, 
said Freeland.
In addition to TA evaluations, the 
Eberly Center has developed a new 
book, Collected Wisdom: Strategies and 
Resources for TAs to assist TAs in ob
taining teaching strategies and other 
helpful hints. The book includes over 
200 teaching strategies expressed by 
experienced TAs and professors, and 
strategies for the different roles ex
pected in a recitation, lab, or discus
sion section. Current TAs will be re
ceiving a copy of the book at their 
departmental orientation.
President delivers annual update
STAFF, from page 1
Before Cohon came to Carnegie Mell
on, Staff Council passed a resolution 
that addressed benefits for both samesex domestic partners and married 
couples. That resolution has not yet 
been acted on by the University. Cohon 
stated that the issue was related to 
diversity on campus. He then outlines 
the actions the University is taking to 
reach a conclusion.
Every one of our constituents can, 
and should, and will be more diverse, 
said Cohon. On this I will be adamant 
and provide leadership. It is an issue 
that is sensitive. It gets people angry 
and upset. But thats not a reason to 
avoid it, and we wont.
Cohon stopped short of saying that he 
was in favor of benefits for same-sex 
domestic partners, but added that he is 
committed to coming to an outcome that 
is good for the University.
Benefits for part-time employees also 
came up at the address. Cohon stated 
plainly that the University had no in
tentions of increasing the number of 
benefits afforded to part-time staff.
Change in benefits for part-time em
ployees is an important issue, said 
Murrin-Macey afterwards. We will be 
continuing discussions with Dr. Cohon. 
The last issue that President Cohon 
addressed in his prepared remarks was 
that of parking. He reviewed the current 
situation and explained that those who
received spaces from the University were 
paying low rates compared to the rest of 
the region. However, he did not offer any 
solutions to the shortage of spaces which 
affects all members of the University.
Cohon announced a program being de
veloped in conjunction with the School of 
Drama to build a sensitivity training pro
gram. The skits developed in this program 
will be put on CD-ROMs and made avail
able to the campus community.
In closing remarks, Cohon reassured 
the staff that they are valued by his 
administration.
The staff is this University as much 
as faculty, students, or anyone else, 
said Cohon. You are as much a part of 
[CMUs] success as anyone else.
Police continue to investigate fire
FIRE, from page 1
Many other residents of Cathedral 
Mansions, who would have to rely upon 
stairs in the case of a fire, were unaware 
of the fire while it was happening.
As of now, the official cause of the 
fire has not been released. Carnegie 
Mellon Campus Police have refused to 
comment on the pending investiga
tion, but they have said that the fire 
has been ruled an accident. At the 
scene, a fire department official ex
plained to residents that an object had 
probably fallen on an electrical cord 
and caused the wire to smolder and
produce smoke but not a large or dan
gerous fire. Junior design major Hillary 
Carey, the resident assistant on duty at 
Cathedral Mansions that night, said the 
same thing.
But Powers gave a different story. 
Powers said that a candle left burning 
by the residents had caused a table to 
catch fire. A source, who wished to re
main anonymous, corroborated the story. 
The source also reported that drug para
phernalia including a water pipe and 
rolling paper were present. The allega
tions of drug involvement are uncon
firmed at this point.
However if a candle was the cause ofthe 
fire, the residents of422 were in violation 
of University Housing Policy. Candles are 
prohibited in University Housing because 
of the fire threat they pose.
Powers also said that he was unsure 
of the reason for the building-wide fire 
alarms failure to activate.He said when 
he called the company that services the 
system, they only told him to reset it.
Carnegie Mellon police expect that the 
investigation into the fire will be com
pleted by Thursday or Friday.
[Ed. Note: Hillary Carey is a member 
ofthe Tartan Photo Staff.]
Empty seats dont stop Senators
SENATE, from page 1
there are three empty seats in 
CIT and one in GSIA, and one 
miscellaneous seat which can only 
be filled by a BHA student. Senate 
seats are distributed based on the 
number of students in each col
lege. There is one Senator for ap
proximately every 140 students.
Chang believes the empty seats 
only pose a problem at the com
mittee level. He said that the 
committees are not the size they 
should be, but this problem will 
be corrected as soon as the empty 
seats are filled.
The vacancies will be filled 
on a rolling basis. In order to be
considered for a vacant Senate 
seat, a student must submit a 
petition with at least 25 signa
tures of Activities Fees-paying 
students in his or her college. 
Senate must then approve the 
candidate. If there is more than 
one student vying for a posi
tion, Senate will choose the 
winner. The ultimate deadline 
for all vacancies to be filled is 
October 12. Chang said he has 
already received petitions for 
CIT and GSIA.
The creation of a separate gov
erning body for the Graduate Stu
dent Association (GSA) will al
low Senate to focus more on un
dergraduate student interests 
than in years past.
Previously Student Senate 
was supposed to represent all stu
dents, but unfortunately, the 
graduate Student Senate seats 
were usually vacant, said Sarah 
Gross, a junior social and deci
sion sciences major and student 
body president. In essence, 
graduate students views werent 
really represented.
Even though its shorthanded 
at the moment, Senate will con
tinue with its normal activities. 
Currently, the various commit
tees are meeting to set agendas 
for the upcoming year.

CMU should expand 
benefits program
The administration has formed 
a committee to look into the pos
sibility of expanding same-sex 
domestic partnership benefits.
: But after seven years of waiting, 
its difficult to view this commit
tee as a substantive, pro-active 
step. The committees formation 
 instead reinforces the fact that 
the administration is still drag
ging its heels on granting full, 
equal benefits for same-sex do: mestic partnerships. This delay 
is unacceptable in a diverse com
munity such as CMU. Action 
should be taken as soon as posi sible to improve same-sex domes| tic partnership benefits.
In 1991, former President 
Mehrabian announced that CMU 
; would officially recognize domes
tic partnerships  existing committed relationships regardless 
| of sexual orientation, including 
opposite-sex partners who do not 
choose to marry. With this recog! nition came the extension of a 
limited-benefits program that did 
not include medical benefits. It 
; seemed as though the CMU com' munity was taking its first steps 
toward equal benefits for same; sex partnerships. But after three 
years, the administration made 
; no further moves toward grant! ing domestic partners the full 
; benefits that married couples re: ceive.
In 1994, a member of the faculty 
and a member of the staff submit: ted a 20-page proposal to the ad; ministration outlining why CMU 
! should increase the scope of its 
 benefit program and how other 
; universities and companies have
this through extended recogni
tion of domestic partnerships. 
Once again, the administration 
took no action to expand domestic 
partner benefits.
Now, in 1998, the administra
tion is passing the issue off to a 
committee for investigation. 
While its better than nothing, 
this action isnt promising for the 
many staff and faculty involved 
in same-sex domestic partner
ships who have been waiting years 
to receive the same benefits as 
their married colleagues. CMU 
should follow in the footsteps of 
other universities such as MIT, 
University of Pennsylvania, and 
Stanford University in granting 
full benefit programs that include 
medical coverage. Also, the ex
cuse that no leading Pittsburgh 
employer has moved to a fullbenefits plan for domestic part
ners is weak, especially since 
Microsoft, Lotus, and Apple ex
tended their full-benefits plans to 
same-sex partnerships five years 
ago.
Too often at this University, we 
mistake tolerance for support. We 
say were a diverse, supportive 
community, one which is wonder
ful because we learn so much from 
each other. But if this really were 
a supportive community, the ad
ministration would extend its full 
benefits to domestic and samesex partnerships. Only by ensur
ing that all of the members of the 
CMU community receive the same 
benefits can this University jus
tify its claim to being non-discriminatory on the basis of sexual 
orientation!Students need 
presidential address
President Cohon presented his 
address to Carnegie Mellon staff 
last week. The event left some 
wondering why such a helpful and 
informative annual event is re
served just for CMU staff. A presi
dential address would also be valu
able and meaningful for the stu
dent body. It could even become a 
campus tradition, and at the same 
time, open more fines of communi, cation between the administration 
and the student body.
Although Cohon is accessible to 
all students during his open office 
! hours, many dont take advan
tage of this opportunity. While 
its nice that he holds office hours, 
this doesnt seem to be the most 
effective manner of addressing 
student concerns. Some students 
may feel uncomfortable approach
ing a high-ranking administrator 
with what they might consider a 
insignificant problem. But if many 
students have similar problems, 
yet none of them approach the 
 administration because they 
think their concern is not impor
tant, the problem will never be 
resolved. An annual presidential 
address to the students would be 
a great way for students to realize 
there are many common issues 
that can be discussed openly with 
administration.
A presidential address to stu
dents should be structured like 
last weeks staff address: Before 
the meeting, students send quesJames Mojonnier/Tartan Art EditorCrash highlights fears of flying

tions they want answered and 
problems they wanted addressed; 
during the address, Cohon de
scribes the administrations posi
tion on these issues and the steps 
being taken to solve each; after
wards, the floor is opened for an 
open question and answer session.
Bringing everyone together for 
this event could provide the sense 
of community that CMU so often 
lacks. After all, the purpose of 
meeting with the staff wasnt only 
to address their problems; it was 
also to inform them about issues 
and current thinking in the ad
ministration, to keep them up-todate with University-wide con
cerns. Students might be reluc
tant to attend such an event at 
first, but with time, they will be
gin to see that such a forum is 
beneficial for them as individuals 
and as a community.
To make a Presidential address 
to students meet its full potential, 
it needs to become a CMU tradi
tion. If a meeting like this takes 
place at least every year, perhaps 
on a significant date in CMUs 
history, it could become an infor
mative discussion with adminis
tration as well as a way to bring 
the entire student body together. 
Communicationbetween students 
and administration is a two-way 
street, but University officials 
clearly have the upper hand in 
initiating the first step toward a 
constant, open dialogue.
Every time we board a commercial 
jet, we are entering a machine made up 
of over two million parts that must 
work together to deliver us safely 
to our destination. Knowing this, we 
must consider what happened to 
SwissAir Flight #111 to be an inevi
table risk when flying. However, it is 
not a precedent.
Flight #111, which crashed into the 
cold waters of the North Atlantic two 
weeks ago, was bound for Geneva from
New Yorks John F. __________________
Kennedy Interna
tional Airport with 
229 passengers and 
crew aboard. The 
plane in question 
was an MD-11 made 
by the McDonnell 
Douglass division of 
Boeing. The MD-11 
has served success
fully in the fleets of 
many safe airlines 
including KLM, Delta, American, 
Garuda, Allitalia, and China Eastern. 
McDonnell Douglass has delivered 
over 170 models in total, but has expe
rienced only two hull losses, includ
ing the recent SwissAir crash, with 
the MD-11.
Many Americans become preoccupied 
by concern over air safety after an air
craft accident. Yet spokespeople for 
Boeing, the worlds largest maker of 
commercial airplanes, cite statistics that 
should put any fears to rest.
Recently at the Farnborough Airshow, 
Boeing cited that, in 1997, 1.3 billion
people flew on over 18 million flights, 
but only 11 died in accidents. Statisti
cally speaking, even if you are actually 
involved in an aircraft accident, you 
still stand a greater chance of living 
than of dying. Air travel is safer than 
any other mode of transport in this 
country. However, the flying public still 
fears boarding an aircraft and taking 
off into the friendly skies. No matter 
how many statistics Boeing, Airbus, or 
the government throws at us, people 
will always love flying, but also fear 
it. So why are Americans so frightened 
of flying?
One reason might be that, for many 
people, an airplane is the most foreign 
place they will ever enter. When you
much of our independence when we fly. 
The passengers and crew of SwissAir 
flight #111, like those of all flights, placed 
their safety and their very lives in the 
hands of two trained pilots. No matter 
how many hours the pilots spend in 
a simulator, no matter how many flight 
hours they accumulate, it is still un
nerving to know that the safety of 
hundreds of people rests in the hands 
of so few.
Feelings of powerlessness are com
pounded by fuzziness about what would 
actually happen in the event of an acci
dent. The safety lecture you receive 
youre about to take off is hardly enough 
preparation for the insanity that could 
follow. Most people know how to buckle 
their seat belts  theyve been 
doing it for many years now, and 
theyre probably quite proficient 
at it. However, they do not know 
how to crawl out of a burning 
heap of metal, wires, seats, bag
gage, bodies, and packs of compli
mentary peanuts. Perhaps to ease 
the publics fear of flying, the avia
tion industry must be more truth
ful with us. If people knew ex
actly how likely it was that there 
would be an emergency and ex
board an aircraft, you enter very unfaactly what would be expected of them
miliar surroundings. You find yourself in such a situation, they might be
encased in an aluminum tube for the less nervous.
Air travel is safer than any other 
mode of transport in this country. 
However, the flying public still fears 
boarding an aircraft and taking off 
into the friendly skies.
next few hours, hurtling, through the 
skies with nothing to do but watch the 
in-flight movie, talk to the interesting 
person sitting next to you, look out the 
window at those puffy white clouds, eat 
bad food, drink liquor, or hit on the cabin 
crew. With these options, it is no wonder 
people hate flying.
Some people fear flying based on the 
realization that they might not be able 
to do much in the event of an accident. 
Unlike when we drive, we surrender
The crash of SwissAir flight #111 is, of 
course, a tragedy. However, the fear of 
flying most Americans have has no base 
in any rational reason. It is a fear based 
on the intimidating concept of flying 
itself  of taking off and traveling at 
hundreds of miles an hour thousands of 
feet in the air.

At the beginning of last 
year, students quickly discov
ered, to their dismay, that 
the renovations to Skibo Gym 
were really just a cruel hoax. 
Some red upholstery and 
some cheesy new equipment 
(the kind thats so thin it 
rattles as you work out) were 
added, but on the whole, the 
gym was still inadequate. 
This year, when the Skibo 
regulars returned, they found 
that the cheesy equipment 
was already inoperable and 
the red upholstery was al
ready worn. What do you sup
pose that means for the equip
ment thats so old it can only 
be dated by unstable isotopes? 
Well, take whatever you sup
pose and imagine it worse.
Each and every day in the 
Skibo Gym is a pitiless 
struggle. To get through the 
exercises involved in a single 
muscle group may very well 
be one of the most frustrating 
experiences of your life. Prac
tically half the equipment is 
either completely broken, 
completely outdated, or is in 
such an unacceptable state 
that it is impossible for a 
proper and safe workout. 
Wires are fraying on Nautilus 
equipment, pins are lodged in 
machines, weights are incon
sistent, and parts are loose on 
everything from benches to 
the sole curl bar. The major
ity of dumbbells are broken, 
bent, or missing. In order to 
do exercises requiring them, 
you have to take a quick run 
to the UC.
Why not just go to the UC, 
you say? Two words  free 
weights. Skibo Gym, located 
in the basement of the old 
athletics building across from 
Maggie Mo, has all the basic 
equipment used in resistance 
training and bodybuilding, in
cluding bench presses, mili
tary benches, squat racks, curl 
bars, and dumbbells over 70 
pounds. The UC does not. 
Skibo regulars include any
one who needs more for their 
workout than cardiovascular 
and nautilus equipment. 
Youll usually see just about

soccer players, rowers, run
ners, bodybuilders, martial 
artists, and anyone else inter
ested in general (or specific)

Good Samaritan Law raises moral issues
Case shows need for responsibility
Open Forum
by Lorelei Laird
The folk wisdom is that actions speak 
louder than words, but sometimes inac
tion says just as much. Take the case of 
David Cash Jr. On a weekend trip to Las 
Vegas, he noticed that Jeremy 
Strohmeyer, a friend and a fellow high 
school senior, had followed seven-yearold Sherrice Iverson into a ladies 
restroom. Curious, he followed, only to 
find Strohmeyer strangling the little girl 
j and threatening to kill her if she 
screamed. Cash tried to get his friends 
attention, but after knocking his hat off 
] and getting no response, he decided to 
j take a walk. Later, when asked why he 
j didnt stop Strohmeyer or notify security 
guards, Cash said that he didnt think 
i there was any cause for concern  though 
f he did ask Strohmeyer later if Iverson 
] had been aroused. An hour after he 
 left, they found the girls broken body 
| in a toilet.
Now Cash faces possible charges as 
, an accessory to the molestation and 
L murder, an angry coalition wants to 
kick him out of UC Berkeley, and radio 
DJs scream that they hope he bums in 
hell. Somehow, I cant feel particularly 
: sorry for him.
There are a whole host of details that 
L are more and more damning for Cash, 
but more relevant are the larger issues 
. that the case raises  do we have a 
; moral duty to intervene when a crime is 
being committed? Should we have a 
, legal duty to do so? Some Californians 
, think so. Theyre trying to push through 
. legislation  Sherrices Law  that 
would require witnesses to report cases 
, of sexual assault against children, as 
; well as petitioning to dismiss Cash from 
Berkeley. It seems clear to me that since 
. Cashs tresspasses are not an academic 
matter, there are no grounds for expel
ling him. Its simply not up to universi
ties to judge their students actions. That 
debate would become moot, however, 
were he to be charged and convicted 
under such a law as the coalition wishes 
to pass. Its hard to commute to Berke
ley from San Quentin.
While at first glance the idea of gov. ernment-mandated tattling seems ty
rannical, its actually not a new concept. 
Several states already have such laws 
; on their books, and social workers and
Legislation invites civil rights abuse
school guidance counselors, at least in 
California, are required to report suspected 
sexual abuse as well. Since this is the first 
Ive heard of their existence, I suspect that 
the precautions written into the law to 
ensure that powerless bystanders arent 
unfairly prosecuted work. With the appro
priate safeguards, Sherrices Law could 
do more good than harm. Im not sure that 
such legislation would work, but its cer
tainly worth a shot.
Closer to home, there are ramifications of 
this in terms of college ethics as well. Cash 
is studying nuclear engineering. My first 
thought when I read that was: Were let
ting a guy with that sort of personal respon
sibility near a nuclear reactor? Im sure 
hes not the only student of potentially 
dangerous technology 
in the country whose 
ethics need correction.
Students need to be im
pressed with the re
sponsibility inherent in 
technological knowl
edge, and universities 
need to play an active 
part in that.
Then theres the so
cial aspect. It was esti
mated that Strohmeyer 
had had four beers on 
the night of the mur
der. When the pair later 
discussed possible de
fenses for Strohmeyer, 
they came to the bril
liant conclusion that 
since he had been 
slightly drunk, perhaps
he could be excused on Corey

grounds of temporary insanity. This strikes 
me as frighteningly close to the rationale 
that certain rapists, husbands, and Presi
dents use to excuse their actions  It wasnt 
my fault! The woman/penis/alcohol made 
me do it! I find it a sad and frightening 
commentary on our culture that they seri
ously thought We let the beer do the think
ing was going to fly in court. Is personal 
responsibility dead? This attitude is not 
uncommon, and at any university, where 
heavy drinking is bound to occur, it should 
be addressed.
Personal responsibility should not be a 
new concept. Its pathetic that we as a 
people should feel that we need to legislate 
it, pathetic that a sophomore at a wellrespected university should feel that he is 
above it, and just plain sad that a little girl 
should have to lose her life to remind the 
rest of us that were not.

It would be hard to find a more vile crime 
than last years torture and murder of a 
seven-year-old girl in a Nevada casino 
bathroom stall. It would be hard to imag
ine an individual act of greater savagery, 
and even harder to conjure up a mote of 
sympathy for the affluent young student 
who committed it. He was accompanied to 
the scene ofthe crime 
by a friend from 
school, who satin the 
stall next door to his, 
and who presumably 
had full knowledge 
of the events occur
ring a few feet away 
from him. Not only 
did this friend do 
nothing to stop the 
killer, not only did 
he do nothing to no
tify the authorities, 
but when the trial 
was concluded, he 
cheerfullyremarked 
to the Los Angeles 
Times that he hoped 
to use his newfound 
fame to score with 
women. Although 
Shopper/Tartan Art Staff he committed no 
crime under Nevada state law, his associa
tion with the murder and his cavalier 
attitude toward it have provoked a reac
tion from a coalition of citizensaction 
groups, led by the victims mother. Some 
20,000 signatures have been amassed to
wards a petition for a Good Samaritan 
law  SharissesLaw  which will make 
it a crime to witness the sexual assault of 
a minor without reporting it to the police. 
The nickname for the law, which suggests 
a voluntary act of goodwill, is somewhat 
inaccurate, as the proposed law will penal
ize people who dont report such assaults.
Any change to our civil rights laws 
should be made with excruciating care. 
The foremost guideline in the minds of 
the revisionists should not be how a law 
can be used against criminals, but how it 
could be exploited to other, less honorable 
ends. While this proposed law focuses 
only on sexual assault, making it a reality 
could open the door to legislation with a 
much broader scope. Quite simply, the 
ability to punish someone for the mere
awareness of a criminal act sets a danger
ous precedent  just ask Lenny Bruce. 
From 1962 onwards, his politically loaded 
stand-up act was besieged with charges of 
obscenity, which he fought tenaciously 
until his suicide in 1966. On at least one 
occasion, when they couldnt get an obscen
ity rap to stick, law enforcement officials 
shut down his act using a California state 
law under which, if you were knowingly 
present in a place where illegal drugs were 
being kept, you could be punished for not 
notifying the police. The true extent of a 
suspects knowledge is impossible to con
cretely prove, so in theory it would follow 
that such a lack of evidence would result in 
an acquittal. In practice, the law provided 
an excellent pretext for arresting political 
dissidents, few of whom had Lennys finan
cial resources to keep them out of prison.
To obtain a conviction with this law, its 
necessary to assume the guilt of the ac
cused, which contradicts the most funda
mental principles of our legal system.
Todays DEA can commit civil rights vio
lations (seizing property, freezing bank ac
counts, and making searches and arrests 
without a warrant) in broad daylight that 
once had to be performed covertly, and a 
Good Samaritan law would only reinforce 
their highly questionable authority. For 
those of you who dont feel personally threat
ened by the War on Drugs, this is only one 
example of the potential abuses such a law 
could legitimize. What if the well-cultivated 
fear of terrorism filling the newspapers 
today evolved into a full-blown witch hunt 
a few years down the road? Fifty years ago, 
with a particularly infamous incarnation of 
the Good Samaritan law in effect, similarly 
improvable charges could bring down any
one the government chose to brand a Com
munist. The label was so flexible, and the 
system so thoroughly corrupt, that wellconnected businessmen occasionally made 
use of it to attack their decidedly un-Communistic competitors.
All of which isnt to say that David Cash, 
the killers friend, didnt in fact break the 
law. His involvement with the guilty party 
should be intently analyzed to see if he 
acted as an accessory to the crime. How
ever, if no evidence of collaboration is avail
able, the issue cannot be pursued any fur
ther. When a particularly odious and wellpublicized case comes to light, and a person 
condemned in the public eye is released 
unscathed, were left with a feeling that 
justice hasnt been carried out. But rashly 
tampering with the innermost mechanics 
of our legal system creates the potential for 
injustice on a far greater scale.

are not. Each experience at Skibo 
reminds me of its chronic state 
of neglect.
Last semester, I saw the fright
ening remains of a Skibo gym ac
cident where the attachment on 
the lat-pulldown machine had 
been completely ripped off. All that 
was left were the frayed remains

Victories put womens soccer squad on track
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
This wek, Carnegie Mellons 
womens soccer team rebounded from 
their 0-2 weekend at the Allegheny 
Tournament, moving their record first 
to 1-2 and finally to 3-2.
Last Wednesday, the team trav
eled to Allegheny once more, this time 
to actually play Allegheny, and won 
3-0. Three days after the win, the 
Tartans played their first home game 
of the season against UAA opponent 
Case Western Reserve University.
I think we were definitely tired in 
the game on Sunday, and that played 
a role in our loss, said Junior Romy 
Fischer. We have made a collective 
decision to up the intensity in prac
tice significantly in order to increase 
our team endurance and to avoid the 
kind of fatigue we faced on Sunday.
The Tartans earned their first goal 
with 20 minutes left in the first half. 
Freshman Gwyneth Gaul headed in a 
comer kick from first-year student 
Marcy Cook to give CMU the lead.
With time winding down in the first 
half, the team earned a direct kick while 
pressing offensively 25 yards out from 
the Allegheny goal. Gaul took the free 
kick and placed it high into an upper 
comer and out of reach of the Allegheny 
goalie to give Carnegie Mellon a 2-0 
lead with four minutes left in the half.
CMU capitalized on their first-half mo
mentum early in the second half. Sopho
more Kari Pylyphyshyn split the defense 
with a pass that first-year student Ashley 
Wermine recieved and shot into the far 
comer of the net past the goalie.
Despite winning 3-0, th team was 
outshot by Allegheny 22-10, and gave 
up seven corner kicks while only earn
ing two for themselves.
Last Saturdays game against Case 
Western proved a tougher match for 
the Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon was able to control 
the ball for most of the game, and did 
earn some scoring chances. Senior 
Lindsay Smith spent much of the game 
alone in CMUs end of the field be
cause of the control the Tartans were 
able to maintain.
The last few minutes of the game 
produced a flurry of action in front of 
the Case Western goal. Carnegie Mellon 
was able to launch a number of shots 
which just failed to go in the net.
At the end of regulation, the score 
was still 0-0. Carnegie Mellon had 
dominated the game, and it was visible 
from the hanging heads of the Case 
Western players. Unfortunately, the 
team would now have to play sudden 
death overtime.
In overtime, Carnegie Mellon contin
ued to control the ball and the game. 
The offense seemed to pick up the pace, 
and replaced hesitation and a tendency 
to put one too many touches on the ball 
before shooting with more aggressive 
play and quicker shots.
Moments later, Gaul recieved a cross
field pass 30 yards from the Case West
ern goal. She turned with the ball and 
let a shot go that cruised over the goalie 
and into the back of the net.
The teams record now stands at 3-2. 
Their next game is against Chatham at 
home before UAA powerhouse Wash
ington University comes to CMU.Junior Romy Fischer moves past a defender.

Tennis team wins 
pair of matches
The CMU womens tennis team has been 
unstoppable so far this season. Last Satur
day, they convincingly defeated both 
Chatham and Division II Shippensburg 
at home.
The first game, against cross-town oppo
nent Chatham, was expectedly non-competitive. The Tartans took all three doubles 
matches easily. Senior Keri Mills and sopho
more Elisabeth Brown swept their doubles 
component 8-0, and the other two Tartan 
pairs won 8-2.
Domination continued in the singles 
matches as CMU swept all six matches in 
two sets. They finished the match with a 
perfect 9-0 score.
Shippensburg proved more of a challenge 
for the Tartans. CMU lost two of three 
doubles matches for the first time this year. 
However, they came back strong for the 
singles. Mills, Brown, freshmen Jill Palermo 
and Kelly Chanopas, and senior Julie Balch 
all won their respective sets, giving the 
Tartans five out of a possible six points in 
the singles. That was enough to erase the
doubles disappointment, and CMU won the 
match against Shippensburg.
The team plays Washington and Jefferson 
at home on Monday before traveling to the 
Flower City Tournament in Rochester.
Home court proves 
beneficial for men
The mens tennis team started its season off 
strong this Wednesday by defeating Allegh
eny College in a dual match at home.
The day did not start off well, as Allegheny 
stole two of three doubles matchs from the 
Tartans. However, the team stepped it up in 
the singles matches.
Senior Dean Ho, junior Apurva Kothari, 
and sophomore Sameer Ker each won their 
respective matches. The days drama was 
provided by sophomore Chanakya Oza.
At the time, Camgie Mellon and Allegheny 
were tied at three points each, and Oza was 
competing for the decidingpoint. After splitting 
the first two sets, Oza found himself down 0-5 
in the final set. Facing elimanation, he won 
seven straight games, taking the set and giving 
CMU the final point needed to win.
The team plays next Saturday at the Flower 
City Tournament in Rochester.

Amazing home run race 
captivates baseball fans
By RICH TORIO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
September 8,1998,8:18 pm CT 
 it was not one of his trademark 
Big-Mac-Land blasts; it was not 
one of his 500-foot whoppers. It 
was not one of his lofty, Ruthian 
home runs that hang in the heav
ens and in our imaginations. 
Sixty-two was a line-shot, his 
shortest of the season. If you 
blinked, you missed it. It was, by 
distance, anticlimactic.
But what made last Tuesday 
unforgettable was not about how 
long it flew. It was not just a 
future Trivial Pursuit question, 
or stat candy for number-crazed 
baseball fans. It was not just 
about Babe Ruth, and Roger 
Maris, and Cooperstown. What 
made that night unforgettable 
was a man, a great, great man, 
named Mark McGwire.
It was his catharsis. In the 
fourth inning, against Steve 
Traschel, McGwire drove the ball 
to left field. Uncertain if it would 
i clear the wall, his eyes followed 
the ball as he trotted towards 
first. As the ball disappeared over 
the fence, the 6 foot 5 inch, 245- 
pound giant became a kid again, 
jumping for joy and leaping over 
first base. As if he were still a 
| little-leaguer, the first-base coach 
| reminded McGwire to touch the 
; bag. All smiles, he tinned around, 
touched the base, and resumed 
his trip into the record books.
The characteristically stoic 
McGwire rightfully celebrated 
this home run. Rounding the 
bases, he high-fived opposing 
Cubs, and they approvingly pat
ted him on his rear as he passed. 
The first of the many hugs
McGwire gave out on this lovefilled night went to the Cubs third 
baseman, Gary Gaetti, his former 
teammate. Bashing forearms 
with his third-base coach, 
McGwire headed home, pointing 
up to the heavens, to the man 
upstairs, as he calls him. The 
atmosphere was jubilant; his en
tire Cardinals team waited for 
him at home plate.
McGwire touched home, and 
fought through the crowd to find 
the one person he wanted to share 
the moment with: his son, 
Mathew. He lifted Mathew high 
above his head, and looked up at 
him with his smiling blue eyes as 
if to say, we did it. Placing his 
son back down, McGwire turned 
to his teammates and allowed 
them to mob him with their con
gratulations. As if to not let his 
son feel left out, he emerged from 
the giant group hug once more to 
bear hug Mathew, planting a kiss 
on his lips.
McGwire turned his son loose, 
and rejoined his teammates, re
joicing. Cardinal congratulations 
ranged from fanny-pats, to fore
arm bashes, to heartfelt hugs. 
Everyone had a chance to share 
his moment in history.
Even Sammy Sosa, the Cubs 
outfielder and fellow pursuant of 
Maris mark, ran in from right 
field to pay homage to the new 
home run king. The sky erupted 
with fireworks as these two ti
tans of the game embraced. Halfjokingly, half-sincere they shared 
each others trademark home run 
rituals: fists hitting in the air and 
mock punches to the gut, finger
tip kisses, and touching of hearts. 
It was a moment of moments in 
this momentous night, mutual
respect expressed in this ex
change of customs.
As McGwire had shared the 
night with his pursuant, Sosa, 
so did he share it with the man 
he passed. McGwire ran from 
home plate to the first-base line. 
He climbed over the railing into 
the stands, to the seats of the 
late Roger Maris family. 
Though McGwire could not 
physically embrace Maris, he 
could not have possibly shown 
more respect for the man; 
McGwire gave out hugs five
fold, embracing or kissing each 
of the five Maris children.
The celebration raged on for 
10 minutes. Ovations erupted 
in stadiums, sports bars, and 
family rooms across the coun
try. Millions of spectators 
watched this giant achieve im
mortality with one swing of the 
bat. Mark McGwires 62nd home 
run would never be forgotten.
Mark McGwire, the man, is 
what we fans of the game will 
never forget about that night of 
Tuesday, September 8, 1998. 
We will never forget the man 
who skipped past first base in 
jubilation. We will never forget 
the man who group-hugged the 
Maris clan. We will never for
get the man who traded mock 
punches and air kisses with 
Sammy Sosa. And we will never 
forget the man who hoisted his 
son into the air, the greatest of 
his trophies, and kissed him, 
for the world to see. Your record 
may be broken some day, Mark 
McGwire, but you will never be 
forgotten. Tony La Russa, 
McGwires long-time manager, 
said it best: He is a better 
person than he is a player.
Soccer beats UAA rival!
SOCCER, from page 10
took one touch on the ball, and 
then let a shot go that beat the 
Penn State-Behrend goalie low 
to the far corner.
Two minutes after Jones 
notched his first of the season, 
Tepper broke through the defense 
using raw speed and determina
tion to beat the defenders in a 
one-on-one foot race and chip the 
ball over the maligned Penn 
State-Behrend goalie.
The guy opened up, said 
Tepper. I looked up and he gave 
me the lane, so I took it.
Teppers goal locked the Tar
tans into a 3-0 lead for most of the 
remainder of the game. With only 
12 minutes left in the game, Brody 
was pulled down in the box, and 
Carnegie Mellon was awarded a 
penalty kick. Tepper took it, and 
set the final score at 4-0.
I think that our 
team chemistry is fi
nally gelling, said 
Jones after the game.
The team would need 
to prove itself against 
a more powerful oppo
nent before it could be 
certain, though. 
Saturdays game 
against Case Western 
provided that opportu
nity to them.
The team went into 
the Case Western 
game looking to even 
its record out and earn 
an important win in 
the UAA. Within the 
first 30 minutes of the 
game, both teams 
scored a goal. The 1-1 
tie held for most of the 
game. CMU was able 
to control the ball and 
the tempo for most of 
the game, and earned 
some chances to score,
but also gave up some chances to 
Case Western. Without the solid 
play of junior goalie Ben 
Kartzman, Case Western might 
have taken the lead.
The physical nature of the 
game took its toll on the flow, 
as three yellow cards were 
given out. Two went to Case 
Western players and one to 
Carnegie Mellon.
The game took on a more fran
tic pace as the end of regulation 
approached. Carnegie Mellon was 
able to force the ball deep into 
Case Western territory, but the 
team was unable to score.
Finally, with two minutes re
maining in the game, the Case 
Western goalie was called for a 
pass back violation because he 
used his hands on the ball when 
a player from his own team passed 
the ball to him.
Carnegie Mellon was awarded 
an indirect kick near the ri ghlj 
hand corner of Case Westerns 
end of the field. The kick did not! 
yield a shot on net, but did result 
in a corner kick.
Off of the corner kick, sopho-! 
more Dave Zupon leapt into the 
air and headed the ball toward 
the goal. The shot was blocked 
and came back to Zupon, who 
was on the ground. He headed 
the ball again and again the shoti 
was blocked, only this time the 
ball came to Ulrich, who was still 
standing up.
Ulrich shot the ball. After bounc-j 
ing off of several Case Western 
players the ball went into the net!
The remaining minute and a 
half was a formality for the mens 
team, which now owns a 2-2! 
record after a sluggish 0-2 startj 
to the season.

VOLLEYBALL, from page 10
exceptional, nearly flawless volleyball. They traded 
points for the first half of the game, and the score 
was 7-7. Wooster came through with good serving, 
followed by a few errors by CMU, and the score 
quickly became 11-8.
Junior Beth Sekowski then helped turn the mo
mentum toward CMU, with a monstrous slam, and 
junior Rachelle Abati dominated the Lady Scots with 
flawless serves as CMU came from behind to win the 
game 15-11.
The victory put the Tartans on a roll as the clean 
passing, communication, and team spirit continued 
into the second game. Momentum is huge in these 
games, especially when you have a young team like 
we do, said Webb. With the score 9-4, Sekowski 
finished a long volley with a strong slam that seemed 
to frustrate the Wooster opponents. They would not 
score again, and the Tartans went on to a 15-4 victory 
in the game and a 2-0 lead in the match.

The womens volleyball team 
celebrates a point in their comback 
win. The victory came in game five 
against Wooster College during the 
quad matches In the UC gym.
Wooster came on strong in the next game, though, ancj 
Carnegie Mellon began to show signs of fatigue. They felj 
behind 2-6 early, and Wooster didnt look back. Tough plajj 
was not enough to edge the Tartans over Wooster, and the^ 
fell 15-5.
The team tried to regain momentum in the fourth game but} 
despite holding an early 3-0 lead, allowed the Lady Scots to ti^ 
the match with a 15-7 win.
The fifth game seemed to come down to whoever wanted ij 
more. Both teams showed clear signs of slowing down. Wheij 
youre tired, its not only physically draining, but its hard t(J 
keep mentally focused, said Webb.
Freshmen Anushka Nethisinghe and Sara Lechleitnej 
combined with Szobota and Putaro to keep the Tartans clos^ 
early. Numerous changes of possession and exceptional de{ 
fense on both sides of the ball kept the score tight and th^ 
game dramatic.
CMU finally broke away from Wooster when the score was 9-j
11 in favor of the Lady Scots. On the strength of exceptional 
serving and relentless blocking, the team scored six unanjswered points to win the game 15-11 and the match 3-2.
This is the best team Ive seen in a long time, said Webb, j
The team will ride the wave of their victory into Skibo Gynf 
this Tueday as Chatham will challenge the Tartans befort* 
CMU travels to Cleveland for the Case Western Tournament 
next weekend.

Men's soccer team 
wins pair at Gesling
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Acting News Editor
Nobody is satisfied with the results of 
the last two games, said senior co-cap
tain of the mens soccer team Dan Brody. 
We wont be happy until we start play
ing like a house on fire, and .that hasnt 
happened yet.
Sometime between when Brody made 
that statement after the teams disap
pointing 0-2 start, and when the Tar
tans took the field last Wednesday night,
able to smoke some people and cross the 
ball into the box.
I love [the change], said Tepper. I 
used to play there. You get a lot more 
touches on the ball. Its really exciting. 
Gaudioso also began pushing players 
harder in practice, and on Wednesday 
the team came out looking like it wanted 
to prove something.

Tartans host quad match
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Editor
Enthusiasm, excitement, and anxiety were at a 
boiling point last Saturday in the University Center 
Gym as the womens volleyball team hosted their first 
quad match of the season. The Tartans battled Wooster 
College, University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown (UPJ), 
and Waynesburg College in a round-robin of best of 
five matches.
The team came in looking to better their fifth place 
finish out of nine at the Kenyon Tournament last week
end. They succeeded.
We played smarter, more aggressive games, said head 
coach Julie Webb. Were coming together as a team.
Teamwork was evident from the start of the day. 
Waynesburg, considered to be the weakest of the days 
competition, was Carnegie Mellons first opponent. The 
Tartans took only three games to finish off the Yellow 
Jackets, aided by the strong play of juniors Stephanie 
Szobota and Sarah Putaro.
Next up was UPJ. Again, the Tartans enthusiasm, 
precise hitting, and defense dominated.
Defensively, no one can beat us, said Webb. As far 
as players go, we werent really better than the other 
teams. The reason why they lose is that they dont 
support each other, while we have great team play.
The work paid off, and the team continued its win
ning streak, winning 15-3, 15-6, and 15-5 in three 
straight games.
As the Tartans were racking up wins, their final 
opponents were putting on an equally impressive dis
play. The Wooster Lady Scots equaled CMUs feat of six
wins in six games and the stage was set for the days best match.
With both teams coming off huge waves of momentum from 
the earlier contests, the noise in the UC gym quickly escalated, 
along with the level of play. In game one, both teams played

While the average CMU stu
dent was deep in slumber, a few 
athletic individuals were up with 
the sun this past Sunday morn
ing for the 11th annual Carnegie 
Mellon Triathlon. Participants
in the event were required to 
swim 500 yards, bike 10 miles, 
and run 3.1 miles both in teams 
or individually.
I wanted to create an event 
that would make people stay a 
little healthier over the summer, 
said Donna Morosky, the 
triathlon coordinator and CMU

fitness and athletic director. 
Morosky wanted people to return 
to school physically fit, so she 
planned an intense triathlon for 
early in the school year.
Some members of the CMU 
swim team gathered together to 
participate in the event. Senior 
biology major Jennifer Skully 
and senior civil engineering ma
jor Michelle Kondo teamed up 
with graduate student Matt Moe 
to take first place in the CMU 
coed team category. Its motiva
tion to stay in shape through the 
summer. It was fun doing it with 
a team. Your team members are 
counting on you, said Kondo, 
who swam the 500 yards during 
the triathlon.
Moe, who has participated in 
the event for the past five years, 
was the bicyclist for the team. I 
just love to compete, he said.
Glen Dubin, a graduate stu
dent in the Heinz School, also 
participated in this years 
triathlon. Ive done these for fun. 
I think the people were friendly. 
Everyone helped each other out 
and cheered us on, he said.
It creates camaraderie be
tween team members, said Bader 
Al-Essa, a graduate student in 
mechanical engineering who was 
on a team with students affili
ated with the Student Life Office.
This year, the event had its 
largest turnout with nearly 180 
individuals participating, up from 
last years 130 participants. Al
though the triathlon started over
a decade ago as an event for CMU 
students exclusively, the event 
has been open to members of the 
Pittsburgh community and sur
rounding areas for several years 
now. According to Morosky, 50 
percent of the participants are 
CMU students and the other half 
are community members. There 
are two categories of winners, 
those that are CMU students and 
others that are non-CMU. The 
winners are further divided by 
age group, gender, and whether 
the participants are in a team or 
racing individually.
[The Triathlon has] changed 
in the percentage of partici
pants. Now there are more 
teams participating and firsttimers, said Morosky.
For students from CMU, the 
cost of participating in the 
triathlon is discounted from $25 
to $15 due to a subsidy from the 
Student Activities Fee. A por
tion of the proceeds from this 
years race will go to the DePaul 
Institution, which aids the deaf 
and blind.
I dont want to say the event 
runs itself, said Morosky. Orga
nizing the volunteers, coordinat
ing the road closing with the city 
of Pittsburgh for race day, and 
advertising the event are all part 
of Moroskys responsibilities.
All her effort was worthwhile, 
however, as this years event, with 
perfect weather, a large number 
of participants, and lots of school 
spirit, was an incredible success.

Annual triathlon challenges students to keep in shape
By RICH TORIO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
What would Saturday be without the 
weekly CMU football squeaker? After 
last weeks painful overtime loss to 
Denison, 20-21, the Tartans deserved 
a game without unnecessary suspense 
 preferably, a win. But last Saturday 
againstfello w UAA member Case West
ern Reserve University Spartans, the 
game was once again decided in the 
closing minutes. What else would you 
expect from a meeting between the 
Spartans and the Tartans?
The first three quarters of the game 
was a war of attrition. The Tartans 
were winning the misleading battle of 
time of possession, but losing the war 
on the scoreboard. Despite the offense 
moving the ball fairly consistently, 
the Tartans had no points to show for 
their efforts. Despite the CMU de
fense playing inspired football, Case 
Western managed one score, a touch
down. And just into the fourth quar
ter, the Spartans held the lead, 7-0.
The ball was spotted on the Carnegie 
Mellon 15-yard line. Down seven, with
the clock winding down, these are the 
moments that define a team. No stranger 
to fourth-quarter comebacks, junior 
quarterback Russ Clay led the CMU 
offense to the line of scrimmage. With 85 
yards between the ball and a tie, they 
began to drive. Methodically, the of
fense marched down the field, deter
mined to score. Outsmarting the Spar
tans, the Tartans engineered an equal
izing 85-yard touchdown drive. Fifthyear senior Matt Jarock tacked on the 
extra point, and the game was tied 7-7. 
With seven minutes left to play, the 
game was far from over.
Case Western Reserve then took the 
kickoff, and the Spartans started a drive 
of their own. The momentum shifted back 
to the Spartan side, as their offense pushed 
into Tartan territory. First and 10 on the 
CMU 44-yard line, the Spartans looked 
poised to score. For the next three plays, 
they averaged 3 yards a play. The ball 
rested on the Carnegie Mellon 35, the 
longest yard between the football and a 
Spartan first down. Out of field goal range, 
the Spartans had to go for it.
The ball was snapped; the Spartan 
line surged forward; the Spartan
backfield headed for the hole. But sopho
more nosetackle Rashad Gray met the 
ball carrier at the point of attack. Blow 
on my bagpipes  that was a big play! 
The Tartans held on fourth down and 
regained the ball on their own 35, with 
about two minutes left to play.
The Carnegie Mellon offense took the 
field, again. Riding the momentum of 
that defensive stand, the Tartans darted 
down the field. They would not be de
nied. Clay led the charge and put the 
nail in the coffin. Only 65 yards later, 
the Tartans deservedly claimed their 
touchdown and victory. Final score: Tar
tans 14, Spartans 7.
We played with heart, tenacity, and 
we won, said Gray after the game. We 
had to pull it out of ourselves.
Head coach Rich Lackner agreed. 
Both sides of the ball stepped it up.
What would Saturday be without the 
weekly CMU football squeaker? Boring 
in comparison. There is never a dull mo
ment for the Tartan football team. Get 
your kilts on sports fans, the home opener 
is this Saturday! I cant guarantee a-win. 
but I am pretty sure it will be close. Cheer 
these men on; they deserve it.

someone must have lit a match. The 
mens soccer team blazed through its 
game on Wednesday against Penn StateBehrend 4-0 and outplayed UAA oppo
nent Case Western Reserve University 
for most of last Saturdays contest before 
breaking a 1-1 tie with less than a minute 
to go in the game to earn a win.
Maybe it was coach Nick Gaudioso 
who turned the gas on for the team. 
After its second straight loss, Gaudioso 
began making moves. Brody was moved 
from the inside midfielder position to 
the outside, and first-year student 
Steve Tepper was moved from the out
side to the inside. Both players liked 
the move.
I think that Coach knows what hes 
doing, and I always used to play outside 
mid, said Brody. I hope that I will be
Finally, with only 12 minutes left before 
halftime, Carnegie Mellon pushed the 
ball past the goal line and gave the 
Tartans their first lead of the season.
The goal came in when the ball was 
crossed into the middle where it was 
deflected by the Penn State-Behrend 
goalie. Senior co-captain Harry Ulrich 
buried the ball into the back of the net 
when it bounced in front of him, giving 
the team a 1-0 lead.
The team finished the half with only 
that one goal; however, the first five 
minutes of the second half were all that 
CMU needed to end any doubt as to who 
was going to win.
Only three minutes into the half, 
Ulrich fed junior forward Doug Jones 
the ball along the 18-yard line. Jones

'Maria' recalls 
days at CMU
By GREGORY NOFI
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Sonia Manzano is better known as Maria to a whole 
generation of people who have grown up watching Sesame 
Street. Manzano has played this role on the shows cast 
since its third season. In addition to acting, she writes 
scripts for the show and 
has won 12 Emmy Awards 
for her writing. Before 
Sesame Street, however,
Manzano once traversed 
the CMU campus as a 
student. Last Thursday, 
she came back to CMU as 
a paii; of "Sesame Street 
Unpaved,  a national 10- 
campus panel tour that 
is a part of Sesame 
Street's 30th anniver
sary. Before the show,
The Tartan had an 
opportunity to speak 
with Manzano.
The Tartan: How
does it feel to be back 
at CMU?
Sonia Manzano: I 
was back here a.cou
ple of years ago, and I 
was surprised at how 
sad I felt.-1 was a lit
tle depressed that 
Skibo isnt here any
more because that 
was part of my life. It 
was Morewood,
Skibo, Doherty. The 
Cut was a center of 
activity, and there 
were a lot of frisbees 
and frisbee-catching 
dogs. And it rained 
on every Thursday 
all the time I 
was here. Crossing 
the Cut during 
the winter was 
also miserable.
TT: Tell, me a 
i little bit about 
your life here as 
a student.
SM: I didnt 
graduate from 
here. During my 
junior year, we 
did a show called 
Godspell. A grad 
student named 
John Michael 
Tebalack pro...
duced it. It was y Cha/Ta^an Photo Editor
a very odd show 
where we were all dressed up as 
clowns and threw trash at each other.
Then John moved to New York City, and he wanted us to 
join him at an avant-garde theater there, so I went there, 
and I was going to get credit for doing the show. The show 
was big in New York and eventually made it to Broadway, 
its hard to imagine a show going from a drama school pro
duction to Broadway.
TT: How did you get started with Sesame Street?
SM: Its not a great story. An agent saw me in Godspell 
and told me there may be a spot for me in Sesame Street. 
So I went and auditioned.
But the thing Ill never forget is the first time I saw 
Sesame Street. I saw it at the student center in Skibo. I saw 
James Earl Jones reciting the alphabet. Then I saw Burt 
Lancaster with numbers flashing over his head as he was 
saying them. I thought, What the hell is this all about? Is 
this for deaf people?
At that time, you didnt see that many black people on 
TV. I was absolutely impressed by the show. It was really 
in your face. This was the first time people of color were 
doing a kids show.
TT: Youve been on the show for many years. What have 
been your favorite moments over this time?
SM: Ive had the opportunity of meeting people like Ste
vie Wonder, Ray Charles, and Tony Bennett. 
Theyve been great moments because when I was 
a little kid, I saw those people on television. Now, 
you see them again, and you remember what is was 
like the first time you saw them on TV.

Cs for Carnegie, thats 
good enough for me....
Last Thursday evening in 
Rangos Hall, the Childrens 
Television Workshop brought 
uSesame Street Unpaved, a 
celebration of 30 years of suc
cess of the childrens pro
gram Sesame Street, to 
CMU. Over 400 CMU stu
dents, faculty, and staff, as 
well as visitors from the 
Pittsburgh community, came 
to see the unprecedented 
behind-the-scenes view of 
Sesame Street.
The presentation was 
designed primarily for col
lege students, especially 
television, film, education, 
and communication majors. 
It provided a chance to learn 
more about the educational 
mandates, animation, story
telling, and other compo
nents that contribute to the 
development of each show.
 Sesame Street Unpaved 
is a way for us to give [some
thing] back to you, those who 
grew up watching Sesame 
Street, said Rosemarie 
Truglio, director of research 
for Sesame Street and the 
moderator for the evening.
I just felt it was the kind 
of program that would have 
broad appeal, said Anne 
Witchner, assistant dean of
Student Affairs, who had 
been planning since April to 
bring the program to CMU. 
The appeal is so great  
from a student who is the 
avid TV viewer, to the stu
dent who wants to do this as 
a career.
Last Thursdays program 
featured a question-andanswer panel of four mem
bers who work with Sesame 
Street in different capacities. 
One member of the panel 
was Steve Whitmire, a prin
cipal puppeteer with The 
Jim Henson Company. Whit
mire joined the company in 
1978, almost right out of 
high school.
I was just an obsessive 
fan, who was fortunate 
enough to have it channel 
into a career, said Whitmire.
With the death of Jim 
Henson, he began the puppeteering of characters such 
as Kermit the Frog and 
Ernie. During Sesame 
Street Unpaved, Whitmire 
and Kermit the Frog enter
tained the audience, as Ker
mit made jokes and faces 
and exhibited well-known 
quirks as he sat in Whit
mires lap.
During the time for open 
questions from the audience, 
Maria Renzelli, a 1997 grad
uate of the University of 
Pittsburgh, shared with the 
panel and audience her story
of the day her mother went 
into labor and her thenthree-year-old sister told her 
mom she wanted the baby 
named Maria since Maria 
on Sesame Street was really 
pretty and really nice.
I have been told that 
story every birthday for as 
long as I can remember, 
said Renzelli. Meeting the 
real5 Maria was something I 
never thought Id do.
The audience was very 
responsive. They sang along 
with well-known Sesame 
Street songs and laughed at 
familiar episodes  the pro
gram closed with a 20-minute 
clip video of the past 30 years 
of the show. At the end of the 
presentation, all those in 
attendance received a 
Sesame Street character doll.
I think that it was very 
successful and am pleased 
that we were able to bring 
this event to campus, said 
Witchner.
Students from all majors, 
from drama and musical 
composition to engineering 
and education, attended the 
program for various reasons.
My older sister actually 
saw the first episode of 
Sesame Street. It is a mix of 
personal and professional 
reasons [for] being here, 
said Chris Cummings, a 
senior drama major interest
ed in television production.
Louis Ransom, a firstyear student in H&SS, was 
also a student in the audi
ence, but to him the pro
gram had a different mean
ing. When Ransom was four 
years old, he began playing 
the part of one of the chil
dren on Sesame Street, 
which he played for a year 
and a half.
My dad worked at the 
Pittsburgh Courier, and they 
took pictures f me which 
were sent out to talent agen
cies and modeling agencies, 
said Ransom. The pictures 
not only landed him audi
tions in various commer
cials, but also an audition for 
Sesame Street.
Ransom remembered how 
before the shows he would 
get to play with the other 
kids. He had the opportuni
ty to work with the actors 
and actresses, as well as the 
puppeteers. According to 
Ransom, they were each 
given a couple of lines and 
were always told to be 
themselves, be vibrant, be 
talkative, and just have a 
good time.
It makes me feel real 
proud that I got to be a part 
of it, said Ransom. Every
body has at least one memo
ry from a Sesame Street 
episode. Its amazing to see 
that one show has touched 
so many people.

Actress reflects on Sesame Street's success
"Before Jim [Henson], puppets were some
thing you learned about in history class.... 
He used [Muppets] to open up conversations 
with kids."
 Sonia Manzano
MARIA, from page LI
TT: Among those famous people, did 
you get to meet Jim Henson?
SM: Yes, of course. Its so tragic that 
hes not with us anymore. It wasnt that 
he was on Sesame Street, but 
his sensibility of the show, his zaniness, 
lived through the show and the Mup
pets. The one-track mind of each Muppet is a product of his sensibility.
Before Jim, puppets were something 
you learned in history class from 
medieval times. And then Jim came 
along with a fresh sense of puppeteering. Muppets werent used to talk down 
to kids; he used them to open up con
versations with kids. He never used 
them in a condescending manner. He 
gave many gifts to many people.
TT: Did you think Sesame Street 
would ever be this big?
SM: No. I remember that we 
thought we were going to go for 
another year or two. But now, the 
show has been going on for 30 years. 
Its a unique thing. Its almost an 
American institution.
The Beatles were formed when four 
people got together at a particular time 
in history. The same thing happened 
with Sesame Street when Joe Raposo, 
Jon Stone, Jim Henson, and Jim Moss 
got together. Joe wrote these songs that 
were so simple and good that you could 
sing along.
TT: What do you think of the Purnell 
Center for the Arts?
SM: I think its going to be a great 
thing. But let me tell you, great things 
have happened in that studio theater.
TT: What is it like for adults to; come 
up to you and tell you that they have 
fond childhood memories of you and the 
show?
SM: Its great. I think people meet me, 
and they tget all emotional. Its not 
because Im on TV, but its because the)' 
watched me as a kid on their moms lap. 
And now theyre in their 20s, and they 
still watch it with their kids.
Im really glad that Latin children 
have the opportunity to watch a Latin 
actress on TV. I didnt have that oppor
tunity as a kid.
Steel drummer rolls new beatinto CMU

Ryan Moskal enjoys the colorful sound and' upbeat 
music typically associated with steel drums.
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Features Editor
When Ryan Moskal looks at a barrel 
of oil, he doesnt see the black stuff 
spilled by the Valdez near Alaska  he 
sees a steel drum waiting to be made. 
The sophomore electrical and computer 
engineering, major is the founder of 
Carnegie Steel, a 17-member steel drum 
band which hopes to make its perfor
mance debut at CMU in the near future. 
The Tartan caught up with Moskal yes
terday afternoon to talk about pans, 
the music, and the spirit associated 
with them.
The Tartan: What originally got you 
interested in steel drums?
Ryan Moskal: At my high school, 
there was a steel drum band. During a 
cultural festival, I saw the band play
ing for the first time; I had heard of 
their performances but never seen one. 
I was just watching them, and I noticed 
that everyone was having a good time. 
The music was lively and energetic, 
and I thought, This is something I 
have to do.
So the following week, I signed up, 
and I end,ed up playing in the steel 
band my senior year. I wish I had 
signed up earlier  I had a fantastic 
time and learned a lot.
TT: Can you tell me a little about the 
drums themselves?
RM: There are many different types 
of steel drums; our band will have six 
different kinds to get the high range, 
the low range, and all the notes in 
between. The notes available vary 
according to which instrument is being 
played.
As far as putting the notes on, all the 
instruments are done pretty much the 
same way. You start with a 55-gallon oil 
drum, like one Exxon would use. The
drum is pounded down 
to make the top surface 
concave with a sixpound sledgehammer.
Then, the drum is 
fired. This changes the 
quality of the steel and 
makes the notes more 
resonant. After firing, 
the individual notes 
are etched into the pan 
and tuned.
A lot of people think it 
is just one big surface 
and you just need to 
know where to hit it to 
get a certain pitch. That 
is partially true, but 
there are definite divi
sions between the notes.
TT: What do you 
think about while you 
are performing?
RM: I like to memo
rize my music. It is a 
bad habit, and as a 
result, I do not sight read very well.
I think about the music coming up 
next, and about performing, about hav
ing a good time  and showing the 
audience that I am having a good time.
That is what this band will be about: 
having a good time performing. Back in 
high school, my band director was a 
very stoic man and did not embellish 
very much. This band is going to try to 
get a little more audience interaction
 just a little something beyond play
ing notes for a crowd.
TT: What was your most memorable 
performance, and why?
RM: During Orientation 1998  
when I was an Orientation counselor
 there was a steel band on the CFA 
patio after convocation. I checked with 
them, and they played in the same key 
as I did. So I asked if I could join
them, and they said, Sure! Grab a 
pan, and I jumped in. We played 
Margaritaville and Rant and Rave, 
which was one of my favorite songs  
it is very lively and fits right in with 
the calypso spirit.
When I really felt like I had become a 
musician, though, was in a jazz compe
tition on March 1, 1997. We had been 
practicing really hard  our instructor 
had been berating and belittling us to 
practice and do well. When we got 
there, we were all real nervous, espe
cially the leads.
But we nailed all the songs  and 
they were hard songs, too  but we hit 
them right on the money. We got a 
superior and an excellent rating for 
that perfomance, and I remember 
thinking then that the band had finally 
come of age, as we had several new
players. It is a neat sensation when 
everything falls into place.
I also got an outstanding soloist 
rating for the that performance, so in 
addition to being good for the band, it 
was also an ego booster for myself.
TT: What would you say to people 
interested in learning to play?
RM: So many people have come up 
and expressed interest; I would love to 
have enough instruments and enough 
time to help them learn how to play. 
Unfortunately, I also need to get a 
degree. I will make as many spaces 
available as possible. For how, we are 
full, but once we get rolling, I will take 
stock in the situation and see if we cari 
have a rotation of people wanting to 
play and learning to play.
People who are interested should by 
all means let me know, and when we 
start playing  hopefully soon  
come out and see what we are all 
about. I think that people who were 
somewhat interested before will 
become really interested.
TT: What do you like most aboutsteel 
drums and steel drum music?
RM: A lot of things! First, not many 
people know what steel drums are or 
how they are played. I get asked ques
tions like, How do skins stretched 
across a drum make a sound like that? 
but steel drums are completely differ
ent  they are hammered in, and the 
whole thing is actually steel.
It is a versatile instrument, good for 
playing all sorts of music, though it is 
most famous for calypso. The songs 
are extremely lively and energetic, 
and it is fun to get into a groove when 
you are playing  swaying back and 
forth and getting into it. It is also an 
exotic instrument; that adds mystery 
to it all.
And, I have a really good excuse to 
buy flowered shirts.

Hackers play new lead role in political activism
The Geek Beat
by Ellen Beldner
It used to be that if you want
ed a revolution, you rounded up 
some confidantes, distributed 
some fliers full of your mani
festo, raised hell, and shot the 
people who were in your way. If 
you just wanted to protest withBut last week, as millions 
upon millions of Internet users 
flooded the Web in search of the 
Starr report, we got smacked in 
the face with one of the muchhyped realities of a netted cul
ture: The Internet is one of the 
major forms of communication 
and information dissemination 
in the industrialized world. Not 
only did people turn to the 
Net in unprecedented numbers 
in search of data  MCI Inter
connect Gateway, which links 
the White House to the Internet, 
counted between 20 and 30 mil
lion hits on Friday, according to 
Wired News  but the U.S. govcourtesy Anti-Online
The hacker group milwOrm broke into many different Web sites, 
replacing front pages with nuclear protest pages like the one above.
in your dominant cultural para
digm, you had to go through a 
huge hassle of sit-ins and plac
ard-holding marches where 
passersby look at you like 
youre crazy. Those were the 
ways to get your message out: 
You had to be loud (and prefer
ably dressed in tie-dye) if you 
wanted the powers that be to 
notice you.
ernment saw the Net as the 
proper and effective way to dis
tribute official information. In 
addition, other types of media 
(namely, newspapers and TV 
news reporting) gave the Net 
coverage in their reports. Stories 
about bit rate and router perfor
mance ran side-by-side with the 
gory details of President Clinton 
and his. cigar, and with these
things, the Net became legit
imized as the tool of those bas
tions of un-geekiness: the gov
ernment and traditional media 
sources.
Now, enter the geeks.
Combine those who trail 
behind technology  specifical
ly, the various governments 
around the world  with a pub
lic who has expropriated one of 
the major outputs of the geek 
culture and throw in the politi
cally active people who have 
been using the Internet since it 
was Arpanet. Consider the fact 
that in a world of almost six bil
lion people, its pretty difficult to 
get your message heard unless 
you do something extreme.
So try hacking: Whether its 
Indias nuke-making supercom
puters or the Pentagon, the past 
10 months have seen a substan
tial increase in both the preva
lence and visibility of politicallymotivated hacks and cracks. 
Hacking is no longer a game 
played by the curious Net 
junkies that slip through fire
walls just for the sake of experi
ence: It has become the guerilla 
warfare of the information age, 
and with governments depen
dence on digital data, it is just 
as dangerous.
When India tested nukes this 
summer in a pissing contest with 
Pakistan reminiscent of that 50- 
year-long incident commonly 
known as the Cold War, people 
and governments the world over 
protested the decision. But India 
remained intransigent: Despite 
immediate and severe economic 
sanctions from the U.S., Britain, 
France, Germany, Japan, Cana
da, Italy, and Russia, popular 
and official opinion in India 
remained nuke-sympathetic.
So what are technologically 
elite anti-nuke protesters to do 
when the object of derision is a 
nation of almost one billion 
inhabitants a half of a world
away? They do what members 
of cracking group milwOrm did: 
They hack into Indian research 
computers. MilwOrm group 
members identifying them
selves only as JF (from Eng
land), VeNoMouS (from New 
Zeland), and savecOre claimed 
to have cracked into the Bhabha 
Atomic Research Centres 
(BARC) computers, taking data, 
altering the Centers Web page, 
and 
erasing data on two of six 
hacked servers (out of a total of 
eight servers).
It doesnt stop there, though. 
The Boston-based hacker group 
Cult of the Dead Cow is current
ly working on a hack into 
Chinas computer systems in 
protest of Chinas human rights 
violations. Just last Thursday, a 
group of hackers known as the 
Electronic Disturbance Theater 
attempted to stage an online 
sit-in on the Department of 
Defenses Web site in support of 
Mexicos Zapatista rebels. And 
last month, hackers took over 
several Indonesian Web sites, 
covering them with digital graf
fiti that protested human rights 
violations against the Chinese 
in Indonesia.
So give up the nerve gas and 
get yourself a T-3 line: The 
route to getting your messages 
heard, were finding, is to use 
the power of the Net plus the. 
power of hackers brains . 
assuming, of course, that you 
dont get caught.

RECENTLY, 
MORNINGSTAR CALLED 
US CHEAP.
ITS NOT EVERY DAY 
YOU GET A COMPLIMENT 
LIKE THAT.
All Financial companies charge operating fees 
x JL and expenses some more than others. Of 
course, the lower the expenses you pay, the better. 
That way, more of your money goes where it 
should towards building a comfortable future.
We make low expenses a top priority.
As the largest retirement system in the 
world1a nonprofit company focused exclu
sively on the financial needs of the educational 
and research communities  our expenses are 
among the lowest in the insurance and mutual 
.Kind industries/
In fact, TIAA-CREF's 0.31% average fund 
expenses are less than half of the expense charges 
of comparable funds:5 Its why Morningstar 
one ol the nations leading sources of annuity and 
mutual fund information  says, "At that level 
[TIAA-CREF] is cheaper than any other
[variable annuity] policy, and is even compet
itive with the cheapest mutual fund complexes, 
though it offers far more benefits."
TIAA-CREF sets the standard in the 
financial services industry.
Of course, expenses are only one factor to 
consider when you malee an investment decision. 
Morningstar also noted our commitment to 
"consumerteducation, service" and "solid 
investment performance." Because that can 
make a difference in the long run, too.
At TIAA-CREF, we believe people would 
like to spend more in retirement, not on their 
retirement company. Today, over two million 
people count on that approach to help them 
build a comfortable and secure future. So 
can you. To find out more, call us at 
1 800 842-2776. Wed consider it a compliment.

Youve heard of the Kevin Bacon game  the one where you can con
nect damn near anything to Kevin Bacon through a sequence of 
movies or related things. Well, its a litde known fact, but theres also the 
Comics game, where you can connect comics to another word through 
rhymes or synonyms. Lets take, as an example ... oh, I dont know... 
chocolate. Here we go: comics rhymes with ergonomics, which is 
synonymous with bioengineering(look it up if you dont believe me), 
which rhymes with clearing, which is synonymous with clarification, 
which rhymes with obligation, which is synonymous with duty, 
which rhymes with fruity, which is synonymous with loco(crazy), 
which rhymes with cocoa, which is synonymous with chocolate.

application development, algorithmic analysis and design, and 
statistical/quantitative analysis.

professional and FactSet's powerful software.

with a working knowledge of finance and technology to offer an 
unparalleled .level of service.
We consider individuals with backgrounds in finance, accounting, MIS

Consultants, so you also need to be comfortable working with people.

Techno show engages audience
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
A performance by the Crystal 
Method is not one where youll find 
yourself in a trance, standing in a 
comer, vacantly listening to the snare 
spike of whatever jungle the DJ is 
spinining. But then again, you prob
ably wont be staring at the stage, 
chanting the words to their songs along 
with the rest of the audience. At 
Metropol last Wednesday, the boys 
from Las Vegas put on a show that 
struck a balance between the indi
vidualism of a rave and the attentive
ness of a Barenaked Ladies concert. 
After watching this show, any fan of 
electronic music, expert or otherwise, 
would be convinced that the Crystal 
Method deserves their reputation as 
one of the best live acts in techno.
With all the recent attention and 
hype given to electronic music, 
electrnica, or just techno, decipher
ing the quality acts from the pop-laden 
trend riders is difficult. Much of this 
attention comes from the success of 
European acts such as Prodigy, the 
Chemical Brothers, and Orbital. Many 
have put the Crystal Method, duo Ken 
Jordan and Scott Kirkland, in the same 
category as these groups. Purists know 
that in the quickly-growing glut of 
electronic acts, and even up against 
these foreign powerhouses, a live act 
that can pull this much excitement 
from an audience is rare.
For last Wednesdays show, the Crys
tal Method set up their gear on a 
stripped-down stage, with the excep
tion of two impressive lighting towers. 
Critics of the Ciystal Methods live act 
have said that they tend to pop in thenmost recent album, the aptly titled
courtesy Outpost 
The Crystal Method played songs from their latest 
album, Vegas, last Wednesday at Metropol.
:, push a few buttons, and sit back. 
In this show, they did play several of 
their most popular songs, including 
Busy Child, the one sophomoric piece 
off that album. Most may know this song 
from the rollerblading sequence in the 
Gap commercial that no one can escape. 
Such an accessible use of the song raises 
questions of the life of the Crystal 
Methods music  if the Gap is using it, 
everybody else soon will be listening to 
it, and in the music industry, that can 
only mean death.
Regardless of their popularity, though, 
the Crystal Methods music is still unde
niably innovative, and their live show is 
irreplaceable. In fact, it is that popular
ity that makes a show by the Crystal 
Method different and more energetic than 
most other live electronic acts. The audi
ence knows the music, as exemplified by 
last Wednesdays renditions of Keep 
Hope Alive, Now is the Time, and 
Cherry Twist. This fact only helps their 
music, and at Metropol, the vibe filled the 
whole room. Only at a show like this can
you see an entire crowd danc
ing and watching the artist 
on stage, but without the feel 
of, say, a Dave Matthews 
show, as if the DJs are pro
viding a service of music to 
the audience. Despite some 
questionable moments, such 
as Shes My Pusher, the 
crowd of about 400 loved it.
Unlike the shows put on 
by techno artists more wellversed in the flourishing 
rave scene, such as Josh 
Wink or Rabbit in the Moon, 
the Crystal Method vary 
their music enough to keep 
to keep an audience actively 
engaged. Rather than run
ning trance or drum n bass beats for 
hours at a time, holed up at the back of 
a stage among piles of gear, the Crys
tal Method play their mix of trance, 
breakbeat, and trip-hop.
Besides a good mix, the Crystal 
Method used a punchy lighting se
quence as a complement to their music. 
Watching the stage was as fascinating 
as any polished recording artist. These 
two are not just record-spinning DJs  
in Keep Hope Alive, Kirkland jumps 
and punches his synthesizer. These 
guys are not passive, aloof DJs, hiding 
behind hooded sweatshirts.
At the end of the show, they ac
cepted their generous applause gra
ciously. For their encore, they came 
back with Trip Like I Do, which was 
possibly the best moment of the night. 
In this song, and most others, the 
Crystal Method gives a keyboard-toss
ing romp through some of the most 
original techno around, making a show 
that audiences are sure to love, re
gardless of how popular they become.
Film gambles with 
clichd plot twists
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Forum Editor
Rounders is one of the funniest movies 
Ive seen in a long time. I spent the 
better part of the movie laughing  at 
the dialogue, at the plot twists, at 
everything.
j What: Rounders 
Director: John Dahl 
(Company: Spanky [Miramax]
Only thing is, it wasnt meant to be 
a comedy.
The movie knows its about Loyalty 
and Taking Risks and Poker as a Meta
phor for Life Itself, and that its subject 
matter is too substantial for it to stop 
taking itself seriously for one instant. 
Which, of course, makes it hilarious.
Matt Damon plays Mike, a New York 
law student who, despite looking like a 
J. Crew model, is an expert poker player. 
After losing his entire tuition in a toorash bet, he vows to give up the game 
and concentrate on his studies and his 
girlfriend (Gretchen Mol). But a few 
months later, his old friend Worm (Ed
ward Norton) gets out of jail. Worm is in 
deep debt and needs Mike to help him 
accumulate a nice pile of cash to get out 
of it. So should Mike get back into gam
bling to help out his pal, or should he 
continue in his path towards legal suc
cess? Oh, the moral dilemma of it all.
Rounders proceeds from here exactly 
like you knew it would. Mike winds up 
spending more and more time playing 
poker and less and less time preparing to 
argue a case in law school moot court. His 
girlfriend cant take his slide downward 
and leaves him; he deals with his pain by
driving to Atlantic City to play some 
cards. Worm manages to offend someone 
else and rack up an even bigger debt, 
which Mike agrees to co-guarantee. 
Theres a big showdown at the end where 
everything rides on one game of poker.
Damon is a good actor, but hes not 
gritty enough to be believable as Mike. 
Hes not helped any by the script, which 
makes him intone such corny lines as: I 
knew all the reasons I shouldnt be here. 
But sometimes reasons dont matter. 
Forget about the card games  for 
Damon and the rest of the cast, keeping 
a poker face during the dialogue is ac
complishment enough.
Yet I didnt have a bad time watching 
Rounders. Director John Dahl does do a 
good job evoking the seediness and men
ace of the poker underworld. His gam
bling characters have names like Joey 
Knish and Amarillo Slim and spew poker 
slang so quickly that it must be authen
tic. His shots of the locales of poker games 
convey so much atmosphere you can smell 
the fear. And he puts you right in the 
games, making you feel the immediacy.
Despite the dialogue, the movies cast 
is universally strong. Especially good 
are Norton, whose false bravado as Worm 
is almost touching, and John Malkovich, 
who plays a poker kingpin with ties to 
the Russian mob and a taste for Oreo 
cookies. Watching Malkovich unscrew
ing an Oreo, and eating it bit by agoniz
ing bit while Damon nervously waits for 
him to reveal his cards, is nearly worth 
the price of admission. The movie moves 
along quickly and holds your attention. 
Watching all the clichs run by was fun.
Yes, I know all the reasons I shouldnt 
have liked this movie. But sometimes 
reasons just dont matter.
Scholar speaks on new artform
By SUSAN MURRAY
Tartan Staffwriter
These days it seems as if noth
ing is truly cutting-edge unless 
it has the term interactive at
tached to it. As if constructing a 
compelling and exciting work of 
literature, drama, music, or 
sculpture werent hard enough, 
it seems that to really catch an 
audiences attention it must be 
interactive as well.
Amidst all the confusion, Janet 
Murray, an MIT literature pro
fessor, released; Hamlet on the 
Holodeck. The book makes light 
of the challenges that will face 
creators of interactive environ
ments in years to come and is 
one of the first publications to 
address the problems raised by 
interactive technologys increas
ing influence on the arts. Murray 
maintains that behind all of the 
hype there is an emerging and 
revolutionary new means of ar
tistic expression. She will speak 
on campus next week about this 
new field and the accompanying 
dilemmas interactive technolo
gies face as an artform.
Murray serves as director of 
the Laboratory for Advanced 
Technology in the Humanities 
at MIT, and is one leader in this 
emerging field of research. Her 
talk, which will take place on 
September 23 as part of the 
Presidents Lecture Series, will 
focus on her recent publication. 
Murray wrote the book as a kind 
of manifesto to encourage devel
opment in the field. She even 
has a definition of the term in
teractive. She said that to be 
interactive, it must be partici
patory, governed by certain 
rules, and it must give the par
ticipants the pleasure of con
trolling their own experiences.
When asked for an example of 
a truly interactive technology, 
Murray mentioned Petz, which 
are virtual dogs which live and 
roam across your computer desk
top, beg to be played with, sulk, 
howl, growl, and scratch, very 
much like real dogs. The Petz 
grow over a period of weeks, 
they can be taught tricks, or 
trained to stay off your term
paper while youre typing. Murray 
explained that because the dogs 
change over the course of their 
relationship with the user, a kind 
of primitive narrative is formed. 
The relationship has narrative 
elements, as in a beginning, 
middle, and end. The dog starts 
as a puppy, grows, and ceases to 
exist when the user becomes dis
interested and decides to create a 
new pet. Evolving agents, like 
the dogs, play a large role in more 
complexnarratives. They hold the 
users attention as they help to 
shape a larger 
narrative.
This narrative 
is at the base of 
almost all of 
Murrays re
search. In her 
book she discusses 
relationships and 
dichotomy be
tween two ideas: a 
modern one, the 
holodeck from the 
television show 
Star Trek, a space 
in which anything 
is possible, and a 
classical one, 
Shakespeares 
drama Hamlet.
She considers the 
idea of what would 
happen if a per
son played the character of Ham
let through the holodeck.
Whether or not it is possible for 
narrative art to exist in an inter
active environment is a hot topic 
of debate. Some of Murrays crit
ics feel that interactive technolo
gies will never grow beyond the 
industry of video games. How, 
they ask, can an artist shape a 
story in an environment that is 
variable? They insist that a user 
will never make the choices that 
take traditional audiences to truly 
dramatic moments which make 
narrative so compelling. A com
mon point made on some of the 
more noisy Internet bulletin 
boards is Would a user playing 
Oedipus ever gouge his eyes out?
Murray does not feel that this 
technology will eclipse existing 
artistic media. She thinks that 
people will still go to the theater,
read, and watch movies and tele
vision. Interactive technologies 
will simply be another way to ex
perience stories. She also insists 
that the work will not stop at 
gaming. It means we have a new 
power, a new set of shapes to rep
resent human experience, she 
said.
Interactive technologies such 
as branching fiction (ChooseYour-Own-Adventure novels), 
virtual reality simulations, and 
even Sony PlayStation video 
games represent a new form of
Holodeck
courtesy MIT press
Janet Murray's Hamlet on the Holodeck is the 
basis for her talk next week on interactive forms.
artist expression, one that re
quires more of the artist than 
ever before. Not only must the 
artist anticipate the reaction of 
his or her audience, to a single 
line of experience but he must 
also anticipate what choices the 
user may wish to make and cre
ate a set of branches. Each 
branch, ideally, is as rich as a 
traditional story line. Murray 
understands the challenges in
volved in the creation of interac
tive worlds; still, she feels that 
digital mediums have the poten
tial to be harbors of true artistic 
inventiveness. I think its pos
sible. We are in the primitive 
stages now.

WRCT launches fall season
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan Contributing Editor
Go ahead. Flip your tuner to
88.3 FM.
If you've been at CMU for any 
amount of time and have man
aged to pull yourself away from 
your computer every once in a 
while, youll know not to expect 
the latest Spice Girls song or 
Puff Daddy tune from Carnegie 
Mellons free-form radio station, 
WRCT.
We have some DJs who wont 
even play a CD if ithas a barcode 
on it, theyre that opposed to 
commercial radio, said Reed 
Taylor, WRCT general manager 
and electrical and computer en
gineering masters student. 
When people think of WRCT as 
being restricted in its musical 
choices, its because its non-traditional. Were not like the com
mercial radio stations. But were 
that way by definition. Its our 
mission to not be like them. Sup
pose somebody did come in and 
wanted to play a very straight
forward classic rock show. 
Theres no way that person could 
do it as well as a commercial 
rock station could, because the 
classic rock station is being paid 
money to do that.
As it begins the fall season, the 
station plans to continue with 
much of the programming that 
has been successful in the past.
Were going to try to get bands 
in the studio and do live record
ings, said Patrick Randerson, 
senior physics major and WRCT 
music director. In the past, 
weve done a lot of smaller local 
bands, but this year were also 
going to try to get the bands 
that AB brings in.
Cliff Chien, sophomore indus
trial management major and 
member of the WRCT music 
staff, is looking to have the sta
tion sponsor Ensign, a punk/ 
hardcore band this semester. I 
was trying to get more hardcore 
and punk acts to play at CMU, 
he said. But at WRCT, we try to 
get acts suitable for CMU, and 
Ensign probably appeals to about 
5 percent of the population.
While the falls program schedAnthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
In the UCs basement, DJs plan set lists from over 90,000 volumes.
ule hasnt been finalized yet, 
Randerson said that he is notic
ing a trend among DJs to play 
classic swing and blues music.
The only control over program
ming we really have is that the 
music staff decides what goes into 
rotation, said Randerson. When 
the station gets new albums, the 
music staff reviews and sorts the 
albums and puts them into the 
playbin, or bin as it is commonly 
known. Each DJ is required to 
play three bin cuts each hour.
A current trend in DJs pro
grams is towards swing, said 
Randerson. Swing has been so 
popular recently that were sort of 
seeing a backlash  some of the 
DJs basicaly said, Ill show you 
what swing is like, and theyre 
going to go back and play older 
music.... Overall, were seeing a 
rounder, fuller jazz program  
bebop is making a comeback.
New DJs each year also add up 
to changes in WRCT programming, 
as D Js pick and choose tunes to air.
Musical tastes are getting 
more diverse, said Paul Jacobs, 
junior industrial management 
major and WRCT training direc
tor. We usually have about 60 
who become DJs at the end of the 
year, so its going really well.
Taylor said that this year, due 
to the influx of new staff mem
bers, it looks like WRCT member
ship will reach 200 students. Be
cause of the increased number of 
DJs that the station will have by
mid-November, Taylor said that 
the station will likely be broad
casting a full 24 hours per day.
By virtue of having so many 
people, we can be a little more 
selective in whos on the air, said 
Taylor. If someone is consistently 
making mistakes or being irre
sponsible, we now have replace
ments. If someones showing that 
they dont have a lot of respect for 
the show they have, I can count off 
five people who have shows from 4
- 6 am who are dying for that 12 -
2 pm slot. Its not so much that 
were kicking people out as that 
they know that we can.
But this knowledge hasnt dis
couraged the current trainees. 
What got me interested in WRCT 
was my experience in listening to 
the radio station for the past year - 
or so, said Lee Horen, sopho-^ 
more business administration, 
major and WRCT trainee. I! 
mostly listen to hip-hop music  1 
independent hip-hop, breakbeats, 
and whatnot. Horen hopes to 
eventually DJ a hip-hop show.
Taylor admits that the station 
sometimes receives comments 
from listeners who complain 
about the music, but says that 
the stations free-format makes 
it largely immune to complaints 
about the musical style.
If you turn WRCT on and say 
Ugh, I hate this, that means 
dont turn us on then, said Tay
lor. It doesnt mean dont ever 
turn it on.

Burnt By the Sun
I know, I know. We all hate subtitles. Theres just 
something about reading in the movies that makes 
us feel dirty all over. But, Id like to convince you to 
get over that literary hump and go see this movie. 
Nikita Mikhalkov directed, wrote, and starred as 
Colonel Serguei Kotov in this 1995 Oscar winner for 
best foreign film about life during Stalins regime. 
Basically, Serguei thinks that just because he was 
this big Bolshevik war hero he can take his much 
younger wife Maroussia and precocious six year-old 
daughter Nadiaand retire quietly in the idyllic 
Russian countryside. Everything is going just fine 
for awhile, but then Dmitri shows up. Who is Dmitri, 
you ask? Well, hes Maroussias former lover who 
ran off years earlier. And I dont have to tell you that 
when your much younger wifes ex-lover shows up, 
no matter how cute your daughter is, everything 
pretty much goes to crap. Then its only a matter of 
time before.... Wait, I should probably stop. Youll 
be doing enough reading during the movie.

The Last Days of Disco
Whit Stillman wrote and directed (but didnt star 
in, the slacker!) this film which takes a nostalgic 
look back to New York in the early 80s. The movie 
focuses on Alice and her roommate, Charlotte, as 
they graduate college, get jobs, and jump right into 
the piranha tank that is the highly selective disco 
_jcene. Its there that they meet the floor manager 
who wards off unattractive girls by telling them hes 
.ay, an ad man whose main job is getting clients 
piito the club, and an assistant District Attorney 
trying to close the whole mess down. Because this is 
a Whit Stillman film, you can bet that some of these 
people will be sleeping with some of these other, 
people. But, Im so sneaky youll just have to see it 
to find out Who.

Deep Impact
Do you ever get the feeling that some movies are 
made just so that the titles can later be used for 
porno films? At first I thought it was just me, but 
after Blown Au/ay and now this, Im beginning to 
think theres something to it. At least its the 
deeper, so to speak, of this summers asteroid 
movies. With no Aerosmith soundtrack and no Ben 
Affleck, its got to be. It stars Mrs. David Duchovny 
(Tea Leoni) as a reporter who, as movie reporters 
are apt to, is just trying to find out the truth, God 
damnit! President Morgan Freeman tells the coun
try that when the asteroid hits the Atlantic Ocean, 
everything will be covered in a huge tidal wave. Do 
we live? Do we die? Do we care? No matter what, the 
special effects involved in a disaster of that magni

Drunken Master
I dare anyone to dislike the star of this movie. Hes 
starred in 66 movies, hes a master comedian, he 
does his own stunts, and he only speaks a smatter
ing of English. Hes Jackie Chan and, as the title 
indicates, hes drunk! While this movie has sub
titles as well, I can save you some valuable reading 
time by telling you that dialogue is not the reason to 
see this film. Instead concentrate on the magnifi
cence of a youthful Jackie Chan in his element and 
drunkenly kicking ass.

Rob Zombie
Hellbilly Deluxe  Geffen
Back in 1987, a band called 
White Zombie appeared with 
Psycho-head, Blowout. The highpitched vocalist of the noisy band, 
Rob Straker, would later change 
his name to Rob Zombie and shift 
the bands emphasis to heavy 
metal. Over 10 years later, he 
strikes out on his own with 
Hellbilly Deluxe, a crunching 13- 
track assault of guttural vocals 
and saw-toothed guitars.
<S;
 - . ,w i I :
Hellbilly wont surprise those 
familiar with the sound of White 
Zombies last two full-lengths or 
the remixed Supersexy Swingin 
Sounds  a grinding sort of 
dance-floor rock, if such a beast 
exists. One glance at song titles 
such as Living Dead Girl, or 
even the records subtitle, 13 
Tales of Cadaverous Cavorting 
Inside the Spookshow Interna
tional, pulls listeners into this 
strange world.
Dragula, the first single, 
starts with a mood-setting ethe
real organ. It quickly moves into 
distorted guitars that wrap 
around a militaristic drumbeat. 
Zombie spins a tale of being dead, 
as the instrumentation gradually 
builds from a lonely bass drum 
kick to urgent, churning guitars. 
The sludgy-sounding chorus bal
ances this, and appropriately, he 
brings up his other great theme, 
sex. All of this may not sound like 
anything special, but the rhymeladen lyrics have a slightly ma
levolent feel and the song is 
quite catchy.
Of the other songs, Demonoid 
Phenomenon sticks out with its 
Thrill Kill Kult-like female echo 
during the verses. Zombies vo
cals, which never vary from 
scarred vocal cord territory, blend 
well here. True, he may whisper 
a song here or there, but its a 
painful one. If silliness, chunky 
metal riffs, and electronic snip
pets give your days meaning, by 
all means check out Hellbilly 
Deluxe. - DAVE ELMAN
Hole
Celebrity Skin  DGC 
????
Looking through various en
tertainment magazines this 
week, it seems that it will be 
difficult to find one not featuring 
a review of Holes third full-length 
album, Celebrity Skin. Even more 
challenging will be finding a re
view that doesnt compare the 
disc to 1994s landmark Live 
Through This, and that doesnt 
provide a full biography of 
Courtney Love and try to explain 
where she fits in todays pop cul
ture. After hearing the new disc 
though, it should be equally hard 
for critics to avoid discussing the 
album  a rich, impressive work 
that again proves that Loves tal
ents are more than deserving of 
her fame.
The music itself has under
gone something of a revision fit
ting of the bands place in the 
music world today. Gone are the 
underproduction, edginess, and 
grungy vocals that made Live 
Through This such a master
piece. Remaining, however, is 
the innovation and thoughtful
ness that marked their best pre
vious work. The first single, Ce
lebrity Skin, shifts between 
metal riffs and pop melodies, as 
does the abuse-themed Hit So 
Hard. Both tracks display the 
power and dynamics that have
made the band popular.
It could be argued that the in
fluence of Smashing Pumpkins 
singer Billie Corgan toned down 
Holes sound, much as Corgan 
did on the Pumpkins Adore. But 
here the change seems like more 
of an adjustment rather than an 
overhaul. The five songs with the 
Corgan imprint on them are all 
strong  in a sense trading Holes 
raggedness for a fuller, more ac
cessible sound.
Despite all the talk of Hole 
perhaps losing some intensity on 
Celebrity Skin, the albums true 
highlights arrive during the most 
provocative and haunting tracks. 
Northern Star, an account of 
fear and loss, creates a cold, deso
late atmosphere by deploying 
strings and acoustic guitars as 
well as Loves only real howling 
on the entire disc. Maybe even 
more interesting is the brisk, 
heavy Playing Your Song, which 
balances an attention-grabbing 
Indian-influenced riff with Loves 
most explicit Cobain references, 
resulting in the albums most com
pelling listen.
Celebrity Skin probably wasnt 
the album most listeners were 
counting on from Hole. Certainly
no one expected them to try an# 
recapture their formula from th 
grunge era, which they thank
fully didnt. Some may have ex
pected a lamentation, or even  
reinvention of the bands souncj. 
Instead, Hole has made a dis 
that is neither an attempt t 
revitalize alternative rock no^ 
just a 40 minute response to th 
media. Love and her bandmateS 
have simply made a remarkablfe 
album that addresses what th 
band feels necessary and other
wise focuses on tight, clear 
songwriting. At this stage in her 
career, an album this strong is 
Loves best bet to keep her bad 
girl image and, in todays 
jumbled poplandscape, stil'i 
matter. - ANDY FRANCIS !

Long ago, being a dude meant that you were something special  
that people respected you. The requirements were easy enough. A per
son was either a dandy man, extremely fastidious in dress and manner, 
or he was a city dweller too unfamiliar with life on the range to be a 
dude. Eventually, surfers popularized the word dude in their 
own way along with many other phrases like cowabunga, 
cious, and radical, man and the world was never the same 
again. Soon enough, though, the word became popular among 
normal everyday folk, and usage of the word increased expo
nentially. In addition to just calling somebody else dude, there 
are now specialized versions of the word like Doctor Dork or 
dorky dork. People have even gone as far as creating new 
spellings of the word like doode or dewd just to differ between 
different people. Nevertheless, being called a dude just 
doesn't mean as much as it used to.
