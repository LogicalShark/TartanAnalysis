Earl Wild) Talented Musician """
It has been said that music is the only art of earth that 
man ruav take to heaven. Music soothes the mind of man. 
calms the angrv beast, and subdues the -wild. But liere at Car
negie we liave a Wild man who subdues music.
Earl "Wild is one of the most outstanding pianists who has 
thumped the kcvs in the Department of Music in reccnt year --  at tue*concerts ,ed the admiration of Pittsburghs music critics and his radio broadcasts have left little to be desired in the way of musical entertainment.
Last Thursday he played his first concert from (h sting studio in th
iw broadExhibition 
Room'of tlie Collese of Fine Arts. His program is now a weekly feature over station WWSW.
He entered Carnegie last year as a regular st'uaentIrrthe D*pavt> ment of Music. Studies left little time for his music, so this year he returned as a special student taking what he wanted. Hestill has a well-filled schedule but he also has time to sit at his piano and produce sweet: music that sooths the wrinkled brow of care."
His parents started him on the musical highway to success when he was six years old. Since that time, be Has: played' and-stu^dalmost every Instrument which is used in a symphony orchestra.At one time a slightly inebriated woman approached him in the middle of  a  concert and offered Jm ten dollars to play Handels

Dr. Wells Describes Purest 
Iron Ever Made, Alloys
the method of steel manufacture were discussed at the eighth annual meeting' of'thfe metal1 lurgical Advisory Board to CaT*- hegie in the Carnegie Union February 8. Over 550 scientists and executives of steel mills listened to papers on investigationsbeing carried on in the Metals Research Laboratory, which told of the latest progress in the study of steel making.Dr. Charles H. Herty, Jr., formerly with the board, presented J'four papers containing a complete yreport o? the research work carried on under his supervision foi' the past eight years. The subjects of the papers were: The Effects of Deoxidation on the Impact Strength o' Carbon Steels at Low Temperatures," RaLe of Transformation and Grain Size," Deox. idation of Steel," and The Control ' of-Iron Oxide in the Basic OpenHearth Process." The effects of various non-metalllc and gaseous .elements on the strength and baroness of steel, and of various methods of removing them by oxidation and deoxidation.
New Methods Described v The manufacture of the purest Iron ever made in large quantities ..and . the behavior of such iron and its alloys were described by Dr. Cyril Wells of the Metals Research Laboratory in' two papers, The ^Preparation and properties of HIch Purltv Iron. " and The Constitution and Behavior of High Purity ifon-Carhon Alloys." Dr. Wells toldhow Carnegie scientists, by "passing purified hydrogen over 'Iron, just below its melting point, 'succeeded in producing iron which Is over .99.95 per cent pure. The impurities still remainingsilicon, nlckle, manganese, chromium, and tjbpperare present in such small quantities that they can be dctev. mined only by spectroscopic methods.Expect New Developments With such pure samples to work with, Carnegie scientists hope to , learn many new facts about the

FLEA-POWER MOTOR 
New photoelectric cells recently developed in  the .General Electric Research Laboratory, furnish enough energy to operate a tiny elecuic motor rated st four tcn-millionths of a horeepower.
These celU" differ from photoelectric tubes in that the cells convert light energy U.o electric energy, whereas phototubes do not themselves generate . electricity hut inatoail control the amount of current permitted to
the building. Thus it is possible for an expend! turc in ctectric energy equivalent to 100 heat units to obtain a total of 300 or 400 units for heating.
 During _tHo" 'summer' th e' process iflTcversedT" The heat is absorbed Irom the air of the build, ing. Then this heat, with the heat from the comprcssora, is dissipated in the water.froiq the well, which then <*-an be u&ed for bathing*

The National Housing Act' makes it possible for the home ' > borrow any amount from

The loans are made with the reservation that themoney will be used only for permanent improvements of the house or grounds. Such things as furniture, radios, and vacuum sweepers may not be purchased with the money. Jf any. new fixtures are attached to the ,property.. as., a^built-in-radlo, it will be considered a permanent improvement.
Rates of interest-on the notes are determined by the financial institution but may not exceed five dollars per hundred dollars . the original face value for a year or five, per cent a yeor. After the loan is made it Is reduced by regular,'equal, monthly payments until It Is paid In full.
These . notes may -run for any number of months up to five years. The terms of the note, however, depend on the * discretion of th financial organization and are usually three years. No security is usually required except that the borrower have a regular Income and a good credit standing. The borrowers monthly Income must, however, be at least five times the amount of the monthly payment.

Will College Plan of Yale

Greek Letter Societies 
Usefulness Doubted 
By Plan Sponsors
Is the fraternity system doomed? If not. will it continue as it has in the past or will it undergo serious changes aiid emerge as
the future of fraternities have been raised in all sections of the country with increasing frequency in the last few* months. With the introduction of the College Plan at Yale and Its subsequent effect on the greek letter societies there have : forth doubts concerning tho
economically and socially sound institution?
in an attempt to answer these questions brlefily let us first examine the system critically and ask,
c-ial betterment of cach individual and bound to one another by the feeling of brotherliness. Actually
the whole by two driveseconomic and social. No one pledges a fraternity to improve hlB scholarship
he thinks can provide^jnore .genial companions, better living conditions, improved social status on the campus, and in some cases because of greater possibilities offered in campus politics.
The survival of the present fraternity system depends on its abilbe secured elsewhere without an undue differences In the actual cost of living, it is true that the College

from 170 to 200 undergraduates. Not only are the Colleges attractive living quarters, but social
conditions at a lower cost than the fraternity is able to provide them. The College, however. i3 not able to give the same feeling of brotherhood which is prevalent among fraternities. A majority of the Yale greek letter societies have decided that this fraternity spirit is sufficient for their continued existence, though they are not allowed to
the .irican collegesndition as exists there today Js not likelyto become prevalent throughout country for many years hence as it involves considerable expense on the part of the-school adopting it. If it does, however, fraternties will probably become more nearly intellectual groups they are today.

Welcii back, Mr. Lowes!
INCIDENTALLY JACK LOWES ASKED ME recently If the Tartan 
grldders wore to have spring training this year. I told him that I 
didn't know, but that In view oi the fact that the Athletic Association 
vas curbing expenses somewhat, I thought that, spring practice might 
bs cut out this year.' Thereon Jock recalled the-outstanding'slump, 
which resulted several years ago, when for two years Carnegie did 
-wilhout spring training;and-experienced the worst seasons In lie foot
ball history. That argument certainly mokes It appear that the Ath
letic Association 6hould And spring training more profitable In the.long 
run than doing withoufit-provided somo constructive coaching: Is 
ployed beside the usual, simple physical exercising of the team.
IN ANOTHER INFORMAL INTERVIEW Milt Dinger deplored the 
ilent managing situation in the Carnegie sport6,- and I was moved to 
gree with him. There are many managing positions open li 
nrious fieldsthe ones of moat Immediate Importance are in track, 
Mere Is a major sport offering many opportunities to the student with 
managing aspirations which) Is notably lacking In representation, all In 
spite of the attractiveness of the conditions surrounding th act)'
Maybe the fraternities think that managing track, swimming, box
inganything except footballIs "small fry," but they should reall: 
that .these fields offer managerships which do.not put great require
ments on time, but which give-the recognition that goes hand-in-hand 
with those organizations which can boast the largest number of aetlvlThere's a place for over a dozen freshmen and sophomores In man
aging the track team this, spring. It would be) a good Idea for the fra* 
ternltiee with an eye out for the future to put good men into these 
jobs as soon as the opportunity Is proffered.
THE ELECTIONS OP THE FOOTBALL captain and manager tor nest
have not taken place, but they will probably be conducted at the 
nest meeting of the Athletic Council. In following the policyof the 
last few years co-captains and co-managers may be elected, Trbovlch 
ud Tevebus the former, and Schmidt and Marino the latter.
THE PLEBE BASKETBALLERS WILL HAVE what wlil probably 
be their best game this coming Friday night In the Carnegie gymnalium. The Penn State frosh will Invade the courts, and although there

Mater if they would sot have been required to

,/ Twice a year students, at Carnegie must 
plunge without any interval from the last 
day of classes to the, first day of examlnatione. The last few daysof classes always 
entail & certain amount of last minute prcpa. ration of laboratory reports or term papers 
,Vahd tlie like, while the week of examinations 
of necessity demands a certain amount of 
^preliminary work. Obviously a brief Interval, 
' If It were only a day or two, between the last 
.day of classes and llret day of examinations 
/.' would be found both welcome and profitable 
by the majority of students. The required 
number of school days could be made up In 
-- the fall and spring, for few can object to 
having the long summer vacation shortened 
by three or four days.
Some people would also have several days 
. free between the last examination and reglstratlon for the second semester, but this is 
by no means as essential as the changes men

One encouraging psychological effect of 
the present economic situation is the 
growth of a mental 'tone of seriousness. 
The most weighty and profound utter
ances can find an enthusiastic audience 
today; l>efore 192D, however, the dilettante, 
rather -than the exhorter, represented the 
typical moo'd! Traditionally the" most 
esoteric thought has been philosophy; the 
attempt to answer the questions what and 
why inrelation to man's destiny has al
ways carried with It an air of mysticism. 
Philosophy was highbrow; but today this 
false conception, probably resulting from 
the attitude of professional' savants, Is on 
the wane.
Philosophy is, after all, the most natural 
of Intellectual pursuits. Granted the sailsfaction of material desires, (and I include in this category a measure of aesthetic  gratification) man will inevitably turn to the consideration of the fundamental axioms of life. The nature of lifeaDd death, the constitution of the external
justification for our answers.

It is not the purpose oi this paper to deny the existence of persons who possess the rare ability to visualize the wider view of tlie world which religion offers; nor can any mundane i
the objective existence of Deity and the reality or His revelation. It is sufficient to point out that the great majority of us separate what religious doctrines we do hold from their  widest implications, and, in so doing, feel the .necessity of calling on other sources than theology lo satisfy our problems.
The pedantic appronch lo th philosophy of life lends through devious paths. .Whatever we learn of our surroundings, whatour observations. Thus the truth rabout the universe outside our minds has quite normally become the subject for study in the branch of philosophy calted by the specialists, eplstemology.. .The result of this pufsult of the real through our epheof an objective world, and then proceeeds

For example, nobody could say with authority what the country really felt and thought about our obligations! under the int of the League, especially the obligation to fight for peace. If necessary. Emiporsons averred that we were bound by ur obligations, eminent persons averred that we were bound by none of them, that we 3 free to act as we might elect. The same true of Locarno.

Medieval Costumes' Are Modified 
For High Academic Ceremonies
By Irving Gruber Do you know the significance of the various colors on academic tumes worn during commencement
Europe, acadomic costumes slat chiefly of caps, gowns, hoods that are used as outer garments by students, holders frees, and officials in universities, colleges, and other Institutions ot learning.
The noticeable feature is the long, full, flowing gown or Tobe, which seems to have been inherited from the  twelfth eud> thirteenth centuries. Flowing robes dignified dress of the time9, and
the university body have persisted with mollifications down to the present. Tho cold buildings or medieval times required capes and hoods for warmth. The cap replaced the hood for the head and the cape with hooi was modified into the present hood, which by colors, trimming, and linings becomes perhaps mo9t noticeable in British and American colleges.
Gowns Uniform In U. S.Unlike European countries, the United States has ft unlfornl sys* tem of degree identification by gown colors, adaptable to each institution, and differing only in the 'college colors which line the hoods. The statute for on Intercolleglato System of Academic Costume was drawn by n commission proposed by Princeton in 1S93, to which loading universities and collegos were invited to seud members.After a study of the European system, the statute, as prepared by

Colors Are Significant
The-colors selected for the different degrees are historic and appropriate and easily remembered. The white for arts and letters comes from the white fur of Oxford and Cambridge B. A. hoods; tbe red for theology follows the traditional color of the church as signifying ardent love and zeal for tbe faith as used by cardinals for centuries. The purple for law comes from the royal pur^e of the kings courts; the green ot medicine from the elripe in the army surgeons uniform and originally from the color of medicinal herbs.
The degrees In philosophy are shown by blue, the color of truth and wisdom; science, gold yellow which blgniaes tbe, wealth contributed by sclent^ discoveries. Pink was taken from the pink brocade prescribed for the Oxford doctors of music; olive allied to green was selected by pharmacy so closely allied to medicine, while rusBet was takon from the jolly old English foresters who wore It in the theyquaffed their brown

Washingtons Birthday 
Occasion for Function
Final arrangements have been completed for the Washingtons Birthday Dance which will be held Friday evening, February 22, in Thistle Hall. This is an annual t which Is sponsored by the Night Student Council.
Val Garvan and his orchestra have been selected to furnish the music for the occasion. While this Mr. Garvans initial appearance a Night School function, he is no means unknown to local dance enthusiasts, and judging from tbe reports of the orchestra committee, tbe band should be well received. 1The. decorations will conform with the spirit of the occasion and ill be carried out in red, white ad blue colors. The committee lias promised something new in the way of decorations. The programs will likewise be executed In novel manner. It is expected that the students ill take advantage of this opportunity to relax and enjoy themselves by attending the dance. As be past, no classes are scheduled for Washingtons Birthday. Due to the fact that this affair will be held on a Friday night, dancing .vill continue from nine till one, .hereby giving the students an exxa~hour of entertainment. Tbe idmissioo, however, will remain :ho same as for previous functions, that Is, one dollar per couple. !

Fraternity Groups Are 
Active on JNight Campus
There nre two fraternities on the Carnegie campus dedicated to Inertests of the night students. These iwo organisations are recognized by the Night Student Council and supplement the work of the Council io providing -the night students with opportunities for social contacts which they would not otherwise have the time to form. Night school attendance is usually a hurried existence and if the students have no excuse for meeting outside, of the classroom they seldom get very well acquainted witli their classmates. The two night school fraternities. Phi Nu and Nu Sigma Alpha, perform a very signal service in bringing together the students from the various classes. Tbe contacts thus formed relieve the monotony of the night school grind and form an important part of tbe student's education.
