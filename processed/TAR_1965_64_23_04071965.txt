Congress Amendment KKG, BTP Named Winners 
Revises Exec Council Qf Qreek g. Competition
By Liz Seley and Candy Etkin
Student Congress passed an amendment at the March 31 
^ meeting that will install the president of the Intramural 
Board on the Executive Council.
The proposed amendment read 
as follows: Be it moved that Ar
ticle II, Section 1, Part A, con
cerning the membership of the 
executive Council, be changed to 
read:
A. The Executive Council shall 
be composed of twelve members
* not in the Student Congress, with 
the exception of the chairman of 
Student Congress, as follows: 12. 
the president of the Intramural 
Board.
Fred Stone, Vice-President of 
the I.M. board spoke in favor of 
the amendment. Arguments stated 
for the amendment included: Ath'letics are now here represented 
at the present time in Student 
t* Government organizations, and 
the President of the I.M. board 
holds a position similar to those 
of present Executive Council 
members as leader of a large per
centage of the student body.
Also argued were the facts that 
there is a need for intramural 
sports to be integrated with other 
activities because they contribute 
significantly to the affairs of the
 entire campus (i.e., Sports Night 
and Homecoming.) This motion 
would provide better communi
cation between athletics and the 
administration as a stated pur
pose of the Executive Council is 
to inform the administration con
cerning non-academic matters.
The Calendar Committee is con
sidering all colleges and univer
sity calendars at this time.
Vernon Leicht, head of the 
Calendar Committee, said that 
he received a poor return 
from congress members of the 
calendar poll he was conduct
ing. Seven out of sixty mem
bers responded.
No calendar change will take 
place before 1967-1968.
A bulletin board for gathering 
suggestions and information for 
 the revised handbook will proba
bly be placed in Skibo.
The Handbook will be pub
lished every four years and will 
hav'e yearly supplements and re
visions. People are still needed to 
work on this publication. Inter
ested students should contact Dick 
Elder, SAE fraternity.
Approximately 20 out of 60 
members were absent from the 
meeting.
$10 Degree Fee

Bachelor, master, and doctoral 
degree candidates for June 7 are

Housing Bill
The Division of Student Affairs 
recently presented President Stev
er with a series of proposals in
volving men and womens housing 
policies at Carnegie Tech.
One proposal suggests various 
structural modifications and al
terations in the mens dormitories. 
Another requests that a profes
sional resident/recreation-head be 
employed in the mens dormito
ries.
The proposals for womens 
housing include: that women who 
are seniors or 21 years or older 
be permitted to live off campus; 
and that A-tower be made into an 
honors dormitory with a mini
mum of regulations. These pro
posals were discussed in detail in 
the February 24 Tartan.
A third womens proposal sug
gests that any group of girls liv
ing in Morewood Gardens be able 
to request a suite of rooms, with 
the understanding that they will 
fill the rooms. Such an arrange
ment would make possible the 
establishment of sorority suites.

Changes On Campus
Morewood Purchase 
Improves Housing
by Cindy Morse
Margaret Morrison women had to travel two miles from 
their 1908 dormitory at Morrison Hall to the Carnegie Tech 
Campus. ~
Casals To Give 
3 Concerts
Several years later Mellon Hall, 
which was located at 5052 Forbes 
Ave., and Forbes Ave., which is 
still standing, was purchased.
The first cafeteria for all stu
dents was located on the fourth 
floor of the Margaret Morrison 
building. After 1924 the womens 
gym was converted into a Wom
ens dining hall, called the Car
negie Inn. This gym was located 
where Donner Hall now stands.
As Carnegie continued to ex
pand, seventeen large resident 
houses were purchased on Forbes 
and Margaret Morrison St. Birch, 
Cyprus, Cedar, and Laurel be
came womens dorms. Some of 
these acquired houses became 
men's dorms, and an infirmary. 
These buildings were similar to 
the present Home Management 
house.
Whitfield, named for Andrew' 
Carnegies wife, was acquired in 
1936 and housed the dining fa
cilities.
According to Dean Cleeton, 
Carnegie Techs official historian, 
the school had sufficient funds 
for building new womens resi
dencies before World War II, but 
felt that the cost was too high. 
Consequently, after the war, Car
negie Tech was faced with the 
necessity of expanding womens 
housing facilities with a cost that 
had doubled since the war.
In 1945, architect Frances J. 
Keally, a Carnegie Tech graduate 
of 191, was commissioned to plan 
for a womens resident hall to be 
located on the sight of Whitfield 
Hall. Keallys plans provided for 
a l1^ million dollar dormitory. 
However, according to Cleeton, 
there was an argument over the 
cost. Upon investigation, the au
thorities found that it would be 
more economical to buy the Morewood Gardens apartments and 
convert them to a dorm.
In 1945 Morewood Gardens was 
purchased and in 1948 renovation 
costing one million dollars began.
It was announced in a Pitts
burgh paper on May 23, 1946 that 
Morewood had been bought by 
Carnegie Tech. The eighty-four 
apartments of Morewood, t h e 
manor house of old England, 
were remodeled into rooms to 
house 400 to 600 girls. The ten
ants of Morewood, described as
prominent names were given 
ample time to find a new resi
dency. The acquiring of More
wood, aceoi'ding to Dean Clee
ton, was the best investment 
Carnegie Tech ever made.
In 1948 women students moved 
into Morewood under the stipu
lation that all undergraduate 
women residents were required to 
live there. A single story addi
tions was added in 1949 to serve 
as a cafeteria. Up until this time, 
contract meals were served at the 
Carnegie Inn. The girls dining 
hall was located on the first floor.
The faculty had to go through 
this area to get to their dining 
hall on the second floor. Dean 
Cleeton remarked, My ears are 
still ringing from the noise in 
that girls dining hall.
As a final addition to womens 
housing facilities on the Carnegie 
Tech campus, E tower of More
wood was completed in 1962 at 
a cost of more than one million 
dollars. It was built to house 280 
girls. It also contains 22 efficiency 
apartments for graduate students. 
The total capacity for women 
students now is 730 and this year 
for the first time, Morewood 
Gardens was filled to its quota.
Pablo Casals, world-renowned 
cellist, will present three concerts 
in Pittsburgh.
Casals will perform his oratorio 
El Pessebre, on April 18, at 8:30 
p.m. at the Syria Mosque.
He will give two Bach Concerts 
on April 22 and 24, at 8:30 p.m. in 
the Carnegie Music Hall.
Student tickets for the concerts 
are available in the Music Depart
ment office.
Tickets for the April 18 concert 
are available at $1.50, $2.00, and 
$2.50. Tickets for the April 22 
and 24 concerts are available at 
prices from $2.00 to $5.00. com
bination or tickets for all three 
concerts, will cost from $4 to $10.

Editorial
Re-evaluation Needed
The faculty and administration of Carnegie Tech have 
not worked very assiduously at trying to understand the at
titudes, values, and expectations of the students, nor at fully 
?nd frankly explaining their own.
This statement by former President John C. Warner 
epitomizes one of the fundamental problems existing on the 
Carnegie Tech campus today: inadequate communication has 
created a gulf of dissatisfaction and lack of understanding 
separating the students on one side, from the faculty and ad
ministrators on the other.
This lack of communication results from a common fall
acious belief, held by most members of both groups, that 
there exists a high, wide wall between administrators and 
students that all but stops an exchange of ideas. But the bar
rier exists only in the minds of these people; this pseudo
wall must be torn down.
It appears from the students point of view, that mem
bers of the administration do not realize that students are 
responsible, mature individuals. Many students, however, 
may have constructive, forward-looking ideas which can 
help faculty and administration improve education at Car
negie Tech. The recent extension of library hours is an ex
ample of such an idea which was communicated to the ad
ministration; the achievement of the extension resulted from 
the combined efforts of students and administration.
It may surprise many students, on the other hand, that 
they can speak openly and frankly to administrators. The 
extension of library hours again serves to demonstrate that 
such communication is indeed possible.
It is the administration which formulates the policy 
decisions governing Carnegie Tech; therefore, it must take 
the initiative to correct the fundamental inadequacies point
ed out by Dr. Warner. Communication, however, presupposes 
reciprocation. Students must act on their own initiative to 
redefine their goals and attitudes into concrete ideas, which 
the administration can use in formulating policy.
Hence, a four-fold re-evaluation is necessary to facili
tate a clear re-statement of goals and policies.
First, the administration must make an attempt to 
formulate goals for Carnegie Tech with well-defined future 
objectives clearly in mind. Furthermore, it is necessary to 
explain in detail to students the purposes and value of these 
objectives.
Second, as administrators re-evaluate their own atti
tudes, they must simultaneously communicate with students 
to evaluate their purposes and ideas. A careful examination 
of student values will aid in the formulation of policies di
rected toward the achievement of mutually satisfactory 
^oals.
Student attitudes, opinions, and needs change with time, 
^hat ten or fifteen years ago sororities did not want Morewood floors, bears no influence over their present desires.
Both students and administrators must rid them
selves of the ghosts of outdated policies and move for
ward, basing the selection of goals on future objectives. 
They must not base the future on existing or past prac
tices, for this serves only to stifle the growth of Carnegie 
Tech.
As a starting point, a re-analysis of student respon
sibility is essential. Student activities, in particular, suffer 
because present policy does not permit the student to assume 
responsibilities concomitant with his abilities. Student Con
gress is capable of and should be allowed to participate in 
oolicy discussions regarding student affairs and activities. 
Working together, the administration and students can re
vitalize the student activities program.
As the administration must re-evaluate, the students 
also are obligated to participate in this re-evaluation. Speci
fically, they must make an effort to understand the policies 
and goals, which the administration has established for Car
negie Tech, and to use this understanding in re-appraising 
their own goals.
Finally, there is need for students to establish a full 
comprehension of their purposes and expectations regarding 
education at Carnegie Tech. The school can establish a satis
factory educational policy only if students can understand 
fully their educational goals and strive to communicate 
these to administrators.
Thus, to solve the communication problem, a four-fold 
reciprocal re-evaluation is necessary: the administration must 
examine both its objectives and those which it has set for 
students; at the same time, students must analyze what the 
administration is trying to achieve for them, and what they 
expect to achieve from a Carnegie Tech education.
Students, administrators, and faculty must take the 
initiative to tear down the barrier which separates them. 
Now is the time to act.

Children Do Not Belong 
In Civil Rights Protests
by James Panopinto
The participation of Negro chil
dren in civil rights demonstrations 
is one of the major faults of the 
present civil rights program. These 
children are being needlessly ex
posed to both physical and psy
chological danger, and it is my 
opinion that these actions will 
have significant repercussions in 
years to come.
How much do the Negro chil
dren understand of the philosoph
ical and political content of the 
direct-action movement? How 
much of their participation is an 
outlet for childhood hostilities? 
Martin Luther King, at a recent 
interview in Selma, described the 
childrens participation as an op
portunity to express creatively 
their discontent with the injustice 
that begins at birth.
However, King fails to realize 
or fails to admit, that along with 
this creative expression the Ne
gro child is being conditioned to 
hate whites, scorn authority and 
take the law into his own hands. 
Even if this isnt the intention of 
demonstrations, it is a frequent 
result, and the trauma of demon
strations, the tension, fear and 
physical and phschologic&l abuse 
will not be easily erased from the 
childs makeup.
Some will argue that the atti
tude of Southern Negroes, as a 
whole, is not openly hostile to
ward whites. The miracle of their 
generally nonviolent, mainly con
structive, responses cant be ex
pected to last indefinitely, how
ever, if one considers the effects 
of the ever increasing number of 
violent demonstrations. Dr. Rob
ert Coles, a psychiatrist from 
Harvard, has studied Negro 
youngsters for the past several 
years, and has concluded that 
they are not affected adversely by 
partaking in the civil rights dem
onstration until they are in their 
teens. He has observer the symp
toms of combat fatigue due to 
excessive involvement in the 
movement. The rises of black na
tionalism, an aimless brand of 
ralicalism, and the hatred of 
whites, or at least of white so
ciety, is seen by Coles as a prob
able result of the participation in 
civil rights movements by young
sters.
Maybe the opinion of this psy
chiatrist is not completely accur
ate, but for the most part, the ar
gument is reasonable. Participa
tion in the civil rights demon
strations by children will scar 
them for the rest of their lives, 
and this will hinder the chances 
of attaining the ultimate goals of 
the movement. Its time to real(continued on page 6)
Student Lauds Criticism 
Of Conditions At Skibo
Editor, the Tartan:
Congratulations to you and the 
Tartan staff for a good-humored 
April Fools issue. Congratulations 
also for the last two editorials 
concerning the need for a student \ 
union. It is high time that the 
administration realized that Skibo 
and the rest of the campus is 
here for the students, not for 
womens social teas and high 
school dances. The students need 
and deserve a student union where 
they can find relaxation to re
lieve their minds during their few 
precious minutes of free time. 
They also deserve a snack bar 
with service similar to that which _ 
any human being receives, and 
has the right to expect from any 
private enterprise.

April Fool Humor 
Seen As Objectionable
Editor, the Tartan:
A sense of humor is useful for 
maintaining a sense of balance 
about life and its problems. But 
there are some things about which 
one does not make April Fool 
humor without causing real hurt 
and offense. Civil Rights is one 
of these concerns.
Many Americans have become 
involved and concerned in recent 
months who never felt it was 
close to them. Many other Ameri
cans have suffered because of de
nial of civil and human rights ^ 
for many decades, and part oi 
their suffering has been over 
their sense of abandonment by 
most of the rest of our citizens.
People are involving them
selves, knowing their very lives 
are endangered when they do so.
A lack of involvement by mem
bers of the Tech community is 
a source of concern to many of us.
But some fifty persons are tu
toring disadvantaged youngster^ 1 
in Pittsburgh, fifteen came to a 
meeting to form a Coordinating 
Committee on Human Rights last 
week, and more have expressed 
interest in it. There ,is a con
cerned core and it is growing.
Lack of involvement in civil 
rights is a serious problem but 
does this kind of April Fool hu
mor help?

For Civil Rights Issue
Understanding Needed 
To End Rights Problem
Editor, the Tartan:
I would like to take exception 
to some statements made by 
James Panepinto in his article 
Understanding Needed for Rights 
Movement in the March 24 edi
tion.
He states that One must not 
be naive enough to believe that 
Negroes, as a whole, will be 
significantly better off if they 
are able to vote. Their economic 
and social status will remain ef
fectively the same. Mr. Pane
pinto completely disregards the 
power of the vote.
In Alabama and Mississippi, 
where Negro registration is most 
difficult, the populations are 30% 
and 42% Negro, respectively. If 
Negro voters had equal repre
sentation, the state legislators, 
governors, U.S. representa
tives and senators would have to 
respond to Negroes wishes or 
face defeat at the polls. The Ne
gro would gain a voice in state 
governments which have here
tofore ignored him. With a voice 
in state government, he would 
eventually be able to improve 
his economic and social status 
and, most importantly, his selfrespect.
Mr. Panepinto also asks, 
Can demonstrations in a hostile 
environment such as Selma or 
Montgomery really hope to re
main peaceful, as the leaders of 
the demonstrations claim? To 
this I have two objections. First, 
if the environment is not hos
tile, there is no need for a 
demonstration. Secondly, the 
violence, if any, conies from 
sources outside the group.
The hate which causes this 
violence is exactly what the dem
onstrators are protesting. This 
hatred will continue to cause 
violence long after the demon
strations are finished, but hope
fully the demonstrations will 
bring the hatred to an earlier 
end than it would have come 
without them.
An example of a totally peace
ful demonstration was the recent 
march from Selma to Montgom
ery. After the march had been 
completed, however, Mrs. An
thony Liuzzo was murdered, ap
parently by members of the Ku 
Klux Klan. Her murder is an 
example of the kind of hatred 
that she and thousands of others 
have been protesting.
Certainly there is need for un
derstanding on both sides as Mr 
Panepinto says. The Negro can
not understand the position of 
the White man because he has 
never been able to hold such a 
position. If the demonstrations 
succeed in bringing Negroes and 
Whites together on an equal foot
ing, understanding will have been 
achieved.
To understand the other, one 
must only understand himself.
Alfred Bortz 
Junior, Physics
Rights Demonstrations 
Serve Useful Purpose
Editor, the Tartan:
In the March 24 issue of the 
a ' Tartan, Mr. Panepinto expressed 
doubts concerning: the value of 
Civil Rights demonstrations; 
whether the efforts of those peo
ple involved in Civil Rights are 
in need of being re-directed, and 
toward the southern white; and 
whether the right to vote would 
significantly improve the Negroes 
position.
Congress shall make no laws 
respecting . . . the right of the 
people to assemble. The right to 
assemble and/or demonstrate is 
basic, and one of the most effec
tive ways for men to express their 
feelings. We notice many in
stances of demonstrations in our 
history, ranging from local picket
ing to the veterans march on 
Washington, D. C.
The demonstrations serve many 
purposes. Bringing the Negroes 
problems into pominence, the public becomes better informed and 
consequently, more sympathetic 
with the Negro cause. Politicians 
are made more aware of the spe
cific demands of the people and 
will go to greater lengths to sat
isfy them. For example, Governor 
Wallace came very quickly to 
Washington, D. C. when demon
strations began in Selma.
In questioning whether the ef
forts of those people involved in 
Civil Rights are in need of being 
re-directed toward the southern 
white, Mr. Panepinto is apparenly unaware of the work that is 
presently being undertaken. Stu
dents are currently working in 
southern states to find white citi
zens who will work toward 
achieving social change with a 
minimum of friction. As preju
dice is not based on rational feel
ings, it is rather useless to try to 
make someone understand Civil 
Rights from a rational viewpoint. 
Work, however, is being done in 
this direction. By showing that 
many problems of the lower class 
whites are similar to those of the 
Negro and how, together, they can 
better their position, is part of 
the program that is currently in 
progress.
Whether the right to vote would 
make the Negro significantly bet
ter off is the third issue. That 
one is significantly better off with 
the right to vote I think is not 
refutable. Looking back through 
our countrys history, we see many 
instances of people willing to die 
or states willing to fight for what 
they considered a fair represen
tation. We see many people now 
fighting for this right and others 
fighting to prevent them from get
ting it.
The right to vote as expressed 
in Amendment XV of our Con
stitution is a basic one. By de
priving fellow Americans of 
this right, we are endangering 
the way of life to which we 
have grown accustomed. In 
many ingrown accustomed.
In many instances the actions 
taken by the law in Alabama 
are/ similar to those actions 
of Fascist Germany during 
World War II. The dark skin has 
replaced the arm bands, but the 
humiliation, beating, clubbing, 
snipping, bombing and killing of 
humans is still present.
As for the Negro, the right to 
vote will help enable him to take 
his rightful place in society. This 
right will help lead the Negro to
ward the goal of equality. Politi
cians will be more anxious to 
meet their demands, and the South 
will undergo a change that will 
help the Negro socially and econ
omically.
There are those among us who 
always find fault in any recent 
proposals or in what is currently 
being done. These people rarely, 
if ever, offer a better solution to 
existing problems, but merely sit 
back and criticize the ideas or 
actions of others. This is easy. 
Anyone can find small faults in 
past and present policies, over
looking the good and magnifying 
the bad. Any Goldwater can sit 
back and say, Everything we 
have done, are doing, and will do 
is wrong and will never work.
It takes a somewhat remark
able man to originate and carry 
out new ideas and courses of 
action. Fortunately there are 
many who lit into this latter 
category. It is because of them 
that progress has been made.
Such men as Mr. Foremen, the 
late Mr. Reeb, Mr. King, Prof. 
Silver, who spoke on this campus, 
etc. fit into this category. It is 
because of the ideas and actions 
of such men, and men before 
them, that we have the democracy 
we now all take for granted in the 
United States today.

In the past few years, the choir 
has made such trips to New York, 
Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.
According to choir representa
tives, the choir is one of the 
most enthusiastic campus organi
zations . . . most members really 
enjoy singing as relaxation enter
tainment, and a diversion from 
the drudgery of studies.
The Cameron Choir was or

Macosko Fights Teammate On 
Straightaway
Urged on by a raucous, highly-partisan crowd of fortyfive students, nine girlfriends, two dogs, and one wife, Techs 
track team opened its season with a 97-43 win over the 
Jeannette Harriers last Saturday at Tech Stadium.
Led by Chris Macosko, Paul4----------------------------------------------------
Denberg, Roger Cairns, Tony Wil
liams, and Bob Diskin the Tartans 
were never headed by the semipro Jeannette club. In fact, of 
Jeannettes 43 points, 34 were 
scored by three men: Jones (14),
Brueggemann (11), and Nyce (9).
Macosko, with a first in the 
880, a second in the two-mile, and 
a tie for first in the mile, was the 
Tartans leading point-getter with 
12. Sairns, who tied Macosko in 
the mile, took an easy first in the 
two-mile to end up with 9, and 
Paul Denberg, with a first in the 
440, a second in the 880, and a leg 
of the winning mile-relay team, 
had 9*4.
Tony Williams and Bob Diskin,
Techs field stars, had 9 and 8 
respectively, with Williams taking 
a first in the pole-vault, a second 
in the high-jump, and a third in 
the triple-jump while Diskin took 
first in the broad-jump, and sec
ond in the triple-jump. I
Tech, which has had a number ! 
of fine track-teams in the past few 
years, did not look like a team ! 
with deep over-all strength, dej 
spite the one-sidedness of the ! 
final score. There were a number 
of close wins and rather ortstanding performances.
Although Tech swept all three 
places in the 440, the winning1 
time of 54.5 will not be competiI 
tive against powers like Indiana,
Westminster, and Grove City. !
Winner Paul Denberg, a freshman,, 
is expected, however, to do far I 
better in future meets. A power! 
ful rumor, Denberg is one of the ! 
finest prospects to appear this1 
year. Tom Terpack, who took secj 
ond, is a two-letterman, but has i 
been absent from coin petit ion for i 
two years. If Terpack can regain 
his previous 51 second form, he ! 
will prove a valuable asset. Jerry 
Peck, in third place, is a sopho
more with previous experience, 
and appears to be rounding into1 
shape.
T* e two hurdles events also ! 
seem to be a certain amount of j 
trouble. Although Tech placed 
second and third in both the highs j 
and the intermediates, the times, i
again, were slow. Bob Biggart is 
the only returning letterman, but 
he has help in freshmen Drew 
Snyder and Harvey Gillis. Snyder, 
who was a high-school champ in 
Buffalo, could play a prominent 
part in the season.
The shot-put is another weak 
point. Gargantuan Gary Page and 
sophomore George Schuessler are 
the Tartans main hopes right 
now. Schuessler placed second 
against Jeannette, but rougher 
competition is coming up on the 
schedule.
With two returning veterans, 
the mile-relay should be in good 
shape, but Saturday's time of 
3:46.4 does not seem to bear this 
out. Hank Werronen and Tom 
Terpack. members of the 1962 
quartet which set the Stadium 
record of 3:29.6, make up the team 
along with John Polles and Paul 
Denberg. Even with the lack of 
competition on Saturdays (a 120 
yard win), the time was fairly 
slow. At least fourteen seconds 
are going to have to be taken off 
Saturdays time to match better 
teams.
Roger Cairns, running in the 
AAU Senior Meet on Saturday, 
March 27, at Schoonmaker Hall 
(indoor*;, set a new Tech record
for the mile with a time of 4:24.5, 
breaking the 1947 record of Paul 
Beamer by over two seconds. Con
sidering that Cairns had to nego
tiate twenty-four turns on the in
door oval, fine things are ex
pected of him this year on the 
outdoor, eight-turn track.
Techs next meet is against the 
Indiana State College Indians, 
this Saturday, at Indiana. Indiana 
eked out a narrow victory over 
Tech last year, and the Tartans 
will be looking for revenge against 
the powerful ISC team. Tech also 
meets Westminster next Tuesday, 
at New Wilmington. Although 
coming very close in the past few 
years, the Tartans have not been 
able to top the perennially tough 
Titans. After a break for Easter 
vacation, Tech will return to ac
tion against St. Francis and 
Waynesburg on Saturday, April 
24, at Tech Stadium.

BTP Heads School Team;
Oosterhuis On First Squad

Rifle Team 
Looks To 
Next Year
by Scott McCormick
Beta Theta Pi, winners of the school championship, 
placed four members on the 1965 I.M. All-School Basketball
?Team.
Alpha Tau Omega, victorious in 
the consolation encounter, placed 
two. The Grad Physics, GSIA, the 
Civil Hammers, and the Trips to 
Win each placed one member to 
round out the ten-player aggre
gation.
Bill Oosterhuis, winner of the 
MVP award, was awarded a first 
team berth for his efforts in lead
ing the Grad Physics into the 
championship game. A strong re-) 
bounder, Oosterhuis continually 
fired in long jump shots from the 
corner to break zone defenses 
wide open. Frank Oliver, the top 
scorer for ATO, was named to the 
all-school team for the second 
year in a row. Oliver, who was 
especially dangerous from the out
side, averaged 17 points per game 
in helping the Taus reach the 
finals.
The third berth on the first!) 
team went to Ray Morrison of 
the Trips to Win. Probably the 
most accurate shooter in the 
school, Morrison continually con
fused his opponents with his abil
ity to suddenly halt on a drive 
and then score on a deadly jump
er. Dale Johnson of BTP claimed 
the fourth first-team position. The 
spearhead of the Betas attack, 
Johnson, had an accurate jump 
shot from the head of the keyhole,^ 
and was very effective as the 
playmaker of the Betas offense. 
The final first-team berth went to 
Mel Ramey of the Civil Hammers. 
One of the fastest guards in the 
league, Ramey continually scored 
on a two-handed overhead jump 
shot in posting a 15 point per 
game average.
The second team was composed 
of three members of BTP, one 
from ATO, and one from GSIA4J 
Beta Theta Pi placed Tom Mauretta, a sharpshooting forward; 
Sam Cupps, their strong rebound
ing center; and Jim Kamm, their 
offensive threat on the fast break. 
Bill Schliep, ATOs center, who 
was strong on both offense and 
defense, and Howie Pifer, GSIAs 
versatile playmaker, round out 
the ten-man squad.
The Carnegie Tech varsity 
rifle team closed its season 
with its finest team effort in 
three years in a losing cause 
to Penn Military Academy, 
1420 to 1415. The Tartans shot 
a 1415, one point higher than 
their outputs against Duquesne, Allegheny, and W&J 
earlier in the season.
Mike Knepley paced all Tartan 
shooters with a 285. Four other 
Tech shooters trailed close be
hind. Rich Damberg had a 284, 
senior Woody Whitlatch a 283, 
freshman Howard Graham a 282, 
and Scott McCormick a 281. This 
was the first time in recent years 
that a score below 281 did not 
place i-i a Carnegie rifle match.
The Tartans have improved 
markedly from two years ago 
when they won only four match
es with a 1377 average. This year 
they won seven out of fourteen 
and jumped their average to a 
1397. With the addition of Mike 
Knepley to the team for the sec
ond semester and the rapid im
provement of freshmen Ted Mankovich and Howard Graham, Car
negie developed into one of the 
better teams in the Allegheny In
tercollegiate Rifle League, with 
only West Virginia and Indiana 
showing better performances.
The team advisor, Capt. J. J. 
Steinback, has high hopes for next 
year. With only Woody Whitlatch 
graduating, Carnegie will have 
six of this years seven lettermen 
back in action.
Mike Knepley, who fired a 290 
at the NRA Sectionals and who is 
easily the teams best shot, did 
not receive a letter this year be
cause of the rifle teams limit of 
seven
enough matches to earn a letter, 
but he should be the key man for 
Tech nevt season. Emory Froelich, 
Bill Nummear, and Fred Klein 
will also be back, and there is no 
reason why the Tartans cannot 
run up a near-perfect record.
