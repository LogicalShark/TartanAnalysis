Speaking to a capacity crowd 
at the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel 
Ballroom on Monday evening, 
February 18, 1968, Mr. Wallace 
made a bitter attack on govern
ment bureaucracy and the Su
preme Court.
Ex-governor for President
* George C. Wallace, ex-govern
or of Alabama, formerly an
nounced his candidacy for the 
Presidency on Thursday, Febru
ary 15. Wallace is a candidate 
because as he put it, neither 
national party gives the voter 
a choice. Mathematically, his 
chances of winning are good. 
By winning only 34 per cent of 
, a states popular votes he re
ceives all the electoral votes of 
that state.
There is not a dimes worth 
of difference between the Re
publican and Democratic party 
candidates, said Mr. Wallace. 
People are fed up with the Fed
eral Government telling them 
how they should run their
11 schools, whom they can sell 
their property to, and how they 
should run their local and state 
governments.
In his speech Mr. Wallace de
tailed his platform. Most of 
what he said made sense and 
the crowd showed its approval 
with frequent applause and 
cheers. Ho attacked the Federal 
^Government for trying to run 
the lives of the people. The gov
ernment is made up of bureau
cratic pseudo-intellectuals with 
pointed heads who cant even 
park a bicycle straight, said Mr. 
Wallace and he called for a re
turn to Constitutional Govern
ment as prescribed by the Con
stitution of the United States 
and specifically by the tenth 
lip Amendment reserving powers 
not delegated to the United 
States by the Constitution to the 
states.
While not mentioning it by 
name, the ex-governor was at
tacking the Supreme Court for 
its interference in the affairs 
of the states. The Supreme
i Court has held state apportion
ment laws unconstitutional, or
dered the desegregation of 
schools, declared state laws in
valid, and interfered with per
sonal property rights, charging 
discrimination.
Mr. Wallace said he was not 
a tacist or a segregationist as 
Phis enemies accuse him. He be
lieves in people running the af
fairs of their own local and state 
governments. If they want to 
have segregated schools he does 
t oare. State laws express the 
oples will as well as nationJ
al laws and no pseudo-intellectua can tell them that they voted 
wrong, said Mr. Wallace.
Help from our allies
In the area of foreign policy, 
Mr. Wallace said we should not 
have been involved in Vietnam 
but that is water over the dam 
now. As president, Mr. Wallace 
would let the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff run the war. We should 
fight for a victory with conven
tional weapons, Mr. Wallace 
went on, but we should force 
our allies to help us with men, 
money or ammunition. The U.S. 
spent billions of dollars in fore
ign aid during the two world 
wars and also helped rebuild 
Europe. Now that we need their 
aid they should help us, said 
Mr. Wallace. Those allies who 
refuse to help would be asked 
to re-pay the loans made to 
them. Foreign aid would also be 
discontinued to Communist na
tions like Romania and Yugo
slavia and the nations who trade 
with the Communists. Mr. Wal
lace is strongly anti-communist 
and again criticized the Supreme 
Court for allowing Communists 
to work in defense plants.
On Protests
Mr. Wallace is equally in
flamed by the protests against

Southeast Asia Colloquium 
To Study Beyond Vietnam
Recognizing the need for more 
rigorous intercultural education 
at Carnegie-Mellon University 
the International Club and the 
University YM-YWCA are pro
posing a colloquium on South
east Asia. The purpose of the 
seminar is to stimulate an in
terest in Southeast Asia beyond 
Vietnam. Discussions w i 11 be 
geared to those students with 
business, engineering and inter
national interests. Through the 
sessions, it is hoped that partipants will develop an interest 
in Southeast Asia, understand 
better the future foreign bus
iness there, and gain a sense of 
the potentialities and consequen
ces of international involve
ments.
The focus of the symposium 
is on industrial development in 
the Philippines, Indonesia, Ma
laysia and Thailand. There will 
be two blocks of study. The first 
study is to include an examin
ation of the physico-economic 
factors affecting industrial de
velopment:
1) resource patterns, 
pects for developments;
pros2) regional association, market 
patterns;
3) international relationships

EDITORIAL
The Draft: A Perspective
This week, General Lewis Hershey announced a change in 
the draft deferment regulations of the Selective Service Commis
sion. It is important, we feel, to look at this set of decisions in 
the light of the present situation, the long run effects, and the 
short run effects. As well, we should possibly consider alternativefe to General Hersheys plan.
Over the short run, which for the purposes of discussion we 
Shall assign the value one year, the draft changes provide an 
excellent solution to the manpower problem. Given fact that 
we need an extremely large number of people to feed the rolls 
of the services, General Hershey hias, in one stroke, opened up 
a new and sufficient group of fresh, warm bodies.
The draft decisions might also, in both the long and short run, 
provide concrete evidence to the Black man that his White breth
ren are going to be given the same opportunity to serve the 
country as he has.
In line with the above, the system will become more and 
more of a lottery as the years progress, and if we must have 
a draft, a draft which gives everyone the same chiance to serve 
would be preferable to one which has a skewed distribution con
cerning any single, fairly homogeneous group.
It appears, however, that the announced changes in draft 
regulation will have in both the long and short runs more unsalutory effects than salutory effects.
The first and most evident problem will be the demise of the 
graduate student on campus. This campus and many others de
pend upon graduate students for recitation instructors, research 
assistants, and, sometimes, primary instructors.
We do not have, on this or other campuses like ours, enough 
professors to take the place of the graduate students. If we dis
place enough professors to take up the task of teaching, research 
will suffer greatlywith long range effects which would be diffi
cult to calculate. As well as present research being truncated, the 
general level of future research will drop off, with opportunity 
losses sure to occur.
As well as considerations of research and education, there 
is an extremely simple matter of economics to consider here. The 
individual has invested at least ten or 12 thousand dollars and 
at least five or six years of effort in each case. As well, the gov
ernment usually invests quife a bit of money in each student in 
the form of loans, grants, and other aid. Now, we submit that it is 
extremely poor policy to take such an investment and put it in a 
position where it is very likely to die. Dead men can serve no one. 
They cannot contribue to society, except as martyrs, and cannot 
repay government loans. There will be quite a bit of money lost 
under the present decision.
Now, how do we suggest that the problem be solved? It 
seems to us that University Military Training for all high school 
graduates would be an efficient, effective answer, both in the long 
and short runs.
First, there would be a sufficient supply of trained personnel. 
That solves the manpower problem. Second, we would not have 
any discrimination in the selection of men for military service, 
since the selection would be universal, except for standard medi
cal deficiencies. Third, universal selection would tend to mitigate the 
hostility of the Black and poor which arises from the Black mans 
inability to send his son to school, thereby gaining a deferment. 
Fourth, the influx of women into the military would provide a 
trained group of people to handle clerial and support work, which 
is important to any large army (it takes roughly five people to 
support one combat soldier). Fifth, all segments of the society 
would have a chance to learn about one another.
All of the above is based upon the premise that there should 
exist a large standing army. (This point is debatacle, of course). 
The point is that if you are going to take anybody, take every
bodyand take them before they waste time creating a life plan 
which will probably be altered, it not destroyed.

Letters To The Editor
TARTAN Disregards 
Interests of Students
Editor, the Tartan:
I am not a journalist. I have 
never taken a course in journ
alism. I hardly know any journ
alists. Yet I believe that there 
comes a point when even I can 
recognize bad journalism. The 
Carnegie Tech Tartan ended 
the last school year with a less 
than glowing record. It was 
evident to everyone that the 
newspaper was barely fulfilling 
the campuss minimum require
ments. All of us hoped that the 
new editor-in-chief, Len Wanetik, with his background in gra
phic arts management, would 
be able to revitalize the Tartan. 
Maybe it could even come close 
to the free and lively weeklies 
of other nationally known col
leges.-----Alas, this was not to
be.
The first publication in the 
fall of 1967 offered a welcome, 
fresh outlook on our predica
ment as students. The second 
did not nearly reach the stan
dards of the first, and since then 
it has been a quickening down
hill road to submediocrity.
It has been many weeks now 
since I have read an article 
which not only proved to be 
well-written, but also interest
ing. Granted, a few of the arti
cles depart from mumbo-jumbo 
journalism, but too few, too 
very few, find relevance to the 
needs and curiosities of Techs 
student body. We are at every 
turn of the page being bombard
ed by detailed and boresome re
counts of far-off or near-at-hand 
demonstrations, exaggerated 
causes,etc. Far be it for me to 
criticize the movement for stu
dent and civil rights, but is that 
all that ever happens in the 
world?
A week at C-MU is certainly 
more than two fifths of the 
front page covered with the 
Mime Troupe; or a typical filler 
article on the number of types 
of liquors available now at our 
local State Stores; or an issue 
which had almost more adver
tisement pages than total pages. 
Consider the plight of C-MU 
Homecoming. Any attempt to 
verify its actual occurrence last 
fall by looking issues of the 
Tartan would certainly run in
to grave obstacles. The only re
ported remains appear to be a 
few small located unibstrusively on the very back page of that 
October 25th issue. Such publi
city is indeed overgenerous for 
the thousands of man-hours of 
work put out by students, the 
delightful Ray Charles Concert, 
or the welcome alumni turnout.
Now the question that I ask 
myself is, whether or not this 
type of journalism reflects the 
reading desires of any signifi
cant segment of the C-MU stu
dent body. My own queries to 
other students appear to answer 
in the negative. It is sad to see 
a newspaper which is apparent
ly being used as a sounding 
board for the personal feelings 
and interests of its editor-inchief. A college newspaper 
should not and must not be 
completely one-sided, reflecting 
its opinions off a very imper
fect mirror. This callous disre
gard for most campus affairs 
has produced a deplorable pa
per.
I know that the Tartans edi
tor-in-chief has the potential to 
mold a really good newspaper.
I contend that with a redefini
tion of the papers purpose, and 
an earnest effort, the C-MU Tar
tan can take on a new place of 
importance in the minds of stu
dents as a framework for ab
sorbing news articles and intel
lectual confrontation.
Respectfully, 
Dave R. Womnnack
Students Further 
Criticism of Course
Editor, the Tartan:
An article was presented last 
week praising the merits of a 
new design course for Senior 
Mechanical Engineers. This 
course gives a class of Seniors 
the opportunity to explore the 
possibilities of unique new fly
ing vehicles. Apparently the 
area of focus was chosen for its 
relevance in todays society, as 
witnessed by the rapid growth 
of aerospace companies, and al
so for the educational value of 
such a broad topic.
Our beef is that this is not 
the only requirement of the 
course. The students must also 
turn in papers on new uses for 
grinding wheels. These new 
uses must be developed from 
both a theoretical and economi
cal standpoint. Very simply-new 
products will be designed; then 
the descriptions of these pro
ducts will be turned over to a 
private institution, The Grind
ing Wheel Institute (composed 
of several large manufactur
ers). The basis by which they 
acquire the rights to these pa
pers is that they are financing 
field trips to plants which use 
grinding processes.
This is hardly any longer an 
academic venture! Although the 
heads of the department will 
surely say that the object of the 
project is to give students ex
perience in designing, the fact 
remains that the students are 
indirectly working for a private 
institution. Moreover, they have 
no say in whether they desire 
to work for this institution. This 
abandons the Hands off poli
cy of a private scholastic uni
versity.
However, in retrospect I must 
state that during a Senior class 
meeting, the department in
formed us that a one-hundred 
dollar prize would be given for 
the best project. But then u66p 
as one student immediately 
asked, Once someone accepts 
the prize, does that mean the 
institute owns the design?

Florida
Date: February 8, 1968
I would like to take this op
portunity to welcome you to our 
City and sincerely hope that 
your stay will be pleasant and 
memorable experience.
In order that neither you nor 
the City incur any unpleasant
ness, the following suggestions 
and policies have been instituted 
and will be adhered to unequi
vocally.
1. Do not come to Fort Lau
derdale unless you definitely 
have a confirmed housing res
ervation. Our policies and orCMU Ski Weekend, 
Mar. 9
The Pittsburgh Intercollegiate 
Conference of Ski Clubs is of 
fering to the members of the 
Carnegie-Mellon University com. 
munity, for only $5.75 ($5.25 for 
groups of 10 more), a day 0| 
skiing at Seven Springs with 
transportations to and from in. 
eluded.
It is necessary to have 40 peopie per bus to make this poss 
sible. As many buses as possi 
ble will be run. If one group 
alone can completely fill a bus 
then the price would be further 
reduced to $5.50 per person or 
$200.00 per 40 passenger bus.
All groups taking part in this 
trip must pay with only one 
check. These prices quoted are 
complete, all taxes are includ 
ed.
It should be noted that reg
ular price for skiing at Seven 
Springs is $6.00 on weekends 
and $5.00 on week days. If for 
any reason there is no skiing 
on March 9, 1968 then the date 
will be postponed till March 23, 
1968. If we are unable to fill one 
bus then it will be canceled.
Ski instruction will be avail
able to beginners thru members 
of the ski club. Rental skis are 
also available at Seven Springs 
at $5.00 per day for Skis, Boots
& Poles.
No deadline has yet been set, 
but notification as soon as pos
sible would be appreciated be
cause buses and tickets must 
be arranged by Feb. 28, 1968, 
Checks should be made out to 
Pittsburgh Intercollegiate Corfl 
ference of Ski Clubs and should 
accompany a 11 reservations. 
Send checks to Box 173 Campus 
Mail with reservations. For 
further information contact 
John J. Cooper Jr.
dinances prohibit sleeping in 
cars and/or sleeping in the 
open. Campers or trailers are 
not permitted to park on the 
beach. If this type vehicle is 
to be used as living quarters 
it must be parked in a trailer 
park specifically licensed for 
this purpose.
2. All the laws that govern the 
conduct of the individual will 
be enforced. A person must be 
21 years of age in order to pur
chase or consume alcohol. Per
sons guilty of intoxication, (it 
should be noted that drinking 
in the open is not permitted) 
narcotics, use of false identifi
cation, creating unnecessary 
noise or any other from of dis
orderly conduct and any other 
unlawful act will be arrested 
and prosecuted.
Violations of the traffic code 
will result in apprehension and 
prosecution of the offender.
3. Parents and school officials 
of any and all students arrested 
during this period will be of
ficially notified.
Students should be aware oi 
the fact that persons who arej 
arrested and convicted on any^ 
charge will have established a 
permanent, and sometimes 
criminal, record against them 
selves which could have a de
trimental influence later in life.
It is the feeling of the City 
Commission, this office and all 
of the City departments in
volved, that if your conduct 
while in Fort Lauderdale fol 
lows your personal guidelines 
while on campus, that your va 
cation will indeed be a pleasant 
and commemorable experience.
Cordially,

F.P.F. Circulates 
Recruiting Petition
2*
The Foreign Policy Forum is 
circulating a petition this week 
protesting General Hersheys 
memorandum of last October 
6. This memorandum recom
mends that local draft boards 
should reclassify registrants 
who are involved in illegal 
demonstrations against the Se
lective Service or aginst mili
tary recruiters. This encourages 
local boards to make their own 
decisions regrading the legality 
of student protests rather than 
relying on due process of law. 
Attorney General Ramsey 
Clark, the American Association 
of University Professors, and a 
number of congressmen have 
publicly opposed General Her
sheys action. In spite of this 
opposition, General Hershey has 
only chosen to publicly reiterate 
his stand.
In a move to protest the di5 rective and to safeguard the 
Constitutional rights of college 
students who might become in
volved in protests or demonstra
tions, seven universities thus 
far have banned all military re
cruiting on their campuses un
til the memorandum is rescind
ed or clarified. The faculty sen
ate at the University of Pitts\ burgh has passed, without a 
dissenting vote, a recommenda
tion to the administration there 
to take similar action.
The FPF petition is directed 
to the Administration of C-MU, 
asking that recruiting be ban
ned on this campus to long as 
the memorandum stands in its 
present form. Signers names 
. will not be made public nor revealed to any other parties. Fol
lowing is the text of the peti
tion:
To The President, Deans, and 
Administration of Carnegie-Mellon University:
In that:
D Lt. General Lewis B. Her
shey, head of the U. S. Selective 
jj? Service System, issued a direc
tive on Oct. 26. 1987, suggesting 
that registrants who interfere 
illegally with military recruiting 
or the draft should be classified 
for immediate callup;
2)The judicial system of our 
government provides the sole 
means by which persons are to 
be judged guilty and sentenced 
for illegal acts; Attorney Gen
eral Ramsey Clark has indioated 
that this directive authorizes ac
tion which may be improper, 
and seven congressmen have 
called such action a denial of 
due process;
3) Lt. General Hershey has 
not rescinded this directive 
which permits the gross circumvention of our judicial system, 
but instead has chosen only to 
reiterate this arbitrary and il
legal threat.
As students who are eligible 
for a affected by the draft, we 
take no collective stand regard
ing our nations military in
volvements. We must, however, 
demand the unimpeded right of 
individual expression on the 
campus. Therefore we request 
the administration of CarnegieMellon University to join in 
tho actions of Columbia, Cor
nell, Dartmouth, George Wash
ington, Princeton, and Yale in
1) immediately suspending all 
military recruiting on our cam

U.S. Mis-Education
Compulsory Mis - Education,
Paul Goodmans indictment of 
the American high school sys
tem and its spin-offs into col
lege will be discussed by Prof. 
John Sandberg, associate pro
fessor of psychology and direc
tor of teacher education next 
Monday, Feb. 26, at 7 pm in 
room 40, Skibo. Goodmans book 
accuses high schools of produc
ing students with regimented 
minds who prefer a lock-step so
ciety. Prof. Sandberg hopes that 
those who attend the session 
will have read the book, but 
this is not necessary. The book 
is available in the campus book
store in paperback; in the same 
volume is Goodmans Commun
ity of Scholars, in which he 
spells out his answer to high 
school education for colleges and 
universities.
Prof. Sandberg may be known 
to some students for his letter 
in the current issue of Mad mag
azine, in which he tells how al
most half of an education class 
could not identify the eminent 
educator, Alfred E. Neumann. 
Those who attend his discussion 
on Monday will be expected to 
be able to do so.

Volumeu67 8Sl1 Nbr7 1) 
the Vietnam policies of the Ad
ministration. One must not con
fuse academic freedom with 
treason, said Mr. W a 11 a c e. 
Peaceful dissent is one thing, 
but advocating the victory of 
the Viet Cong and marching on 
the Pentagon is giving aid and 
comfort to the enemy; there
fore, an act of treason. Those 
professors leading the marches 
in the name of academic freed o m are pseudo-intellectuals 
guilty of treason. They should 
be prosecuted to show the 
enemy that the nation as a 
whole is behind the President 
in his Veitnam policy.
On the issue of the rising 
crime rate, the ex-governor said 
that he would give his moral 
support to the policemen and 
firemen because they are the 
thin line between complete an
archy in the streets and the phy
sical safety of every person.
He is in to win
Mr. Wallace emphasized his 
determination to win outright. 
His purpose is not to take votes 
away from both parties and 
force them to make bargains 
with him. He believes his 
chances are good and looks for 
support from the average man 
on the street who resents exces
sive taxation and the takeover 
of personal rights by the Great 
Society.

Do you think a bright young engineer should spend his most imaginative years on the same assignment?
Neither do we.
Thats why we have a twoyear Rotation Program for 
graduating engineers who 
would prefer to explore several 
technical areas. And that's why 
many of our areas are organ
ized by functionrather than 
by project.
At Hughes, you might 
work on spacecraft, communi
cations satellites and/or tacti
cal missiles during your first 
two years.
All you need is an EE, ME 
or Physics degree and talent.
If you qualify, weJI arrange for 
you to work on several different 
assignments...and you can 
help pick them.
You may select special
ized jobs, or broad systemstype jobs. Or you can choose 
not to change assignments if 
youd rather develop in-depth 
skills in one area.
Either way, we think 
youll like the Hughes ap
proach.
It means you'll become 
more versatile in a shorter 
time. r-----------------n
(And your j HUGHES i salary will 
show it.)

Gone With The Wind
Back With A Gale
by TONY LAWRENCE
No picture in history (Citizen Kane not withstanding) ever 
succeeded in capturing the public imagination as did Gone with 
the Wind. The famous search for the right actress to play Scar
lett OHara; the numerous directors and writers hired and fired 
on the production and the famous bid to get Clark Gable to play 
Rhett Butler have only furthered and enhanced this legendary 
picture. GWTW is now back for the sixth time and may be seen 
at the Stanley Warner; to recommend it goes without saying.
The collaboration of talent on GWTW is, by todays standards, 
astonishing. There has yet to be a film as exciting, of the same 
length and as provocative today. The 225 minute running time is 
barely noticeable. I doubt, seriously, the film could be made today 
for to do it by Hollywoods current epic standards is to do it a 
gross injustice.
No actor and a role were ever so perfectly wed as Clark Gable 
to Rhett Butler. It seems Gable played Rhett Butler for the rest 
of his career and there is little wrong in that. The unforgettable, 
and there are many, shot of Gable standing at the bottom of the 
stairway evoked tremendous sighs from men and women alike 
in the audience. His charisma is not tarnished in the least and 
his power on the screen is brilliant. Vivien Leigh is superb and 
radiant, a difficult combinations, as Scarlett. Another memorable 
sequence is at the end of Part I when she goes out into the fields 
of Tara alone and vows: As God as my witness, Ill never be 
hungry again. Olivia De Havillands Melaine is perfect. To have 
been unbelievable in the part would have been easy. But Miss De 
Havilland crafted this fragile humanitarian woman with great 
skill and comes off beautifully. It is Leslies Howards perform
ance as Ashley Wilkes which doesnt appear to have worn as well 
through the years. Howard seemed almost unsure of the role and 
lacked a true committment to the part. I found it difficult to un
derstand why and what his great attraction was. Thomas Mitch
ells Irish Gerald OHara and Hattie McDaniels Mammy were 
excellent.
Max Steiners score ranks as possibly the greatest achieve
ment in film music. Ernest Hallers photography is an innovation 
and his choice of shots, composition and angles are all magnificent. 
The pull-back to reveal the massed dead in the Atlanta streets is 
overwhelming as is the siege of that city.
Nostalgia may enhance the enjoyment of this film, but should 
not obscure its basic strength. It is questionable just how valuable 
blowing up the original 35 mm print to 70 mm. At times things 
seem slightly masked and vaguely diffused. The screen is almost 
too big. The stereophonic additions to the sound are a tremendous 
asset to the picture.
No picture since has had as great a sense of surrounding and 
environment. The merging of all aspects of film provide a rare 
compelling emotional experience. The collaboration of the many 
craftsmen involved created a monumental legend and the true 
attainment of a measure of human immortality.

New Idea in Films 
At Underground Fest
A festival of Underground 
Feature Films, the first of its 
kind in the Pittsburgh area, will 
be given its debut on Wednes
day, February 28, in Porter Hall 
100, at Camegie-Mellon Univers
ity. Leading off the festival will 
be Lloyd Michael Williams 
award-winning film, Lines of 
Apogee.
Filmed in black and white 
and color, and five years in the 
making, Lines of Apogee rep
resents one of the boldest and 
most advanced steps yet in the 
field of the Underground Cine
ma. Williams, winner of a gold 
medal and silver medal at the 
Cannes Film Festival, and first 
prize winner at the Canyon Cine
ma, Bolex, ad Midwest Film 
Festivals, calls Lines of Apogee 
his most complete and satisfy
ing work, and this opinion is 
shared by most fil mcritics.
Also included on the program 
is a shorter feature by Rudy 
Burckhardt, Lurk. A mad fan
tasy of Ho6gl6o Borealis and 
his luscious daughter Aurora, 
loose in the mysterious forests 
of Maine, Lurk is perhaps the 
most famous Underground Film 
of its type, and has received 
wide critical and audience ac
claim in both this country and 
Europe.
Lines of Apogee and Lurk
will be shown at 7:00, 9:00 and 
11:00, in Porter Hall 100, at Car
negie-Mellon University, on 
Wednesday, February 28. Be
cause of smaller seating capa
city in Porter Hall, it is advised 
that those wishing to be as
sured of tickets arrive at least 
15 minutes before showtime.

Perhaps the most beautiful movie in history.-The New Yorker. "Ex
quisite is only the first word that surges in my mind as an appropriate 
description of this exceptional film. Its color is absolutely gorgeous. 
The use of music and, equally eloquent, of silences and sounds is 
beyond verbal description. The performers are perfect-that is the 
only word.-New York Times. "May well be the most beautiful movie 
ever made.Newsweek. "Of such incomparable beauty of star and 
scene that one seeks in vain for its equal/-New York Post.

On Feb. 10 the team traveled 
to Thiel, with the home team 
taking the meet by a score of 
67-37. Les Hough took a first 
in the 50 yard freestyle. First 
places were also captured by 
Bigelow in the individual med
ley and by La Rochelle in the 
200 yard butterfly.
The team played host to an 
exceptionally strong Youngs
town team on Feb. 13, losing by 
a 66-36 margin. The Youngstown 
team, probably the strongest on 
the C-MU schedule, inspired 
record performances by John 
Perry and Jeff La Rochelle. 
Perry, taking a second place, 
set a school record of 12.22.1 in 
the 1000 yard freestyle. La Ro
chelle took a first in the 200 
yard butterfly with a record 
time of 2.26.1.
Saturday, Feb. 17, saw the 
team lose a heartbreaker to
Allegheny at the C-MU pool. 
The teams went into the last 
event, the 400 yard freestyle re
lay, with the score 49-48 in the 
Tartans favor, the outcome of 
the meet depending on the win
ner of the event. The depth prob
lem was brought into focus as 
a tired relay team of Hough, 
Wentz, Perry, and Beal all 
swimming their third events of 
the meet, lost an exciting race 
by half a body length. One of 
the highlights of the meet was 
a Tartan victory in the medley 
relay. Les Hough, swimming 
the final freestyle leg, came 
from behnd on the last length 
to grab the victory. Perry and 
La Rochelle again turned in 
strong performances, Perry 
winning both the 1000 and 500 
yard freestyle and La Rochelle 
taking the butterfly. The final 
score was 55-49.

Penn State breezed to a 70-45 
win last Wednesday evening. 
The Tartans used a deliberate 
style of play which was aimed 
at exploiting the weak spots in 
Penn States zone at the foul 
line and in the left corner. But 
the C-MU field goal accuracy 
of 31 per cent could not com
pete with the Nittany Lions 
sharpshooters who hit on 44 per 
cent of their shots.
The Tartans went out in 
front 3-2 as the game got under
way but six points by Penn 
State gave them the lead which 
they never relinquished. After 
five minutes of play, Barry 
Hummel sustained an ankle in
jury and was replaced by Bill 
Weborg. Misfortune struck the 
Tartans in a different form as 
Lang got into foul trouble and 
was replaced by Bill Abraham 
for the final two minutes of the 
fist half. During these two min
utes of Langs absence, explod
ed for ten more points to lead 
38-19 at halftime.
For the first eight minutes 
of the second half, the Tartans 
were staying even with the 
Lions from University Park. 
They were faced with a 17 point 
deficit when Lang grabbed a 
rebound and picked up his fifth 
personal foul as he drove past 
two opponents who were reach
ing for ukl ball. From uklol
Penn State coasted to their 25
point victory.
The crowd in Skibo Gym wit
nessed standout performances 
by Penn States sophomore 
guards Tom Daley and Gregg 
Hamilton who led their team 
with 17 and 15 points, respect
ively. Daley's numerous steals 
and pass deflections were in
strumental in limiting the Tar
tans scoring attack. Bob Grazzini earned a starting berth at 
center and put in a strong de
fensive effort as well as nine 
points. Lang led C-MU with 11 
points and Weborg led in re
bounds with 10.
The next game for the Tartans 
will be tonite at St. Vincent, 
whom C-MU beat at home 77- 
58. Saturday the Tartans will 
face powerful Grove City, led 
by junior Jeff Claypool and four 
other sophomore starters. Game 
time is 2:30 pm.

Suggestions Given 
For Apathy Problem
by Gordon Cohn
Two weeks ago C-MU sent 
Jacquelin Pratt, Perry Cohen 
and Gordon Cohn to the Civitas 
Conference at Cornell. The pur
pose of the Conference was to 
examine the problem of student 
apathy on college campuses and 
to suggest programs to combat 
the problem.
Most of the programs discuss
ed during the conference were 
aimed at involving students in 
projects which were similar to 
the Peace Corps, or which in
volved participation in commun
ity or social action projects as 
a part of the students educa
tion. The aim was to increase 
the students sense of social 
awareness.
The main problem with pro
jects of this nature is that they 
tend to attract students with 
already strong humanistic atti
tudes, rather than the engineer 
or the art student. This is due 
in part to the necessarily high 
professional and technical orien
tation of these students. They 
have a very limited amount of 
timeboth in class and to their 
ownin which to develop this 
social awareness. There is no 
clear-cut solution to the prob
lem.
With this in mind Student Con
gress has created a standing 
committee, the Social Services 
Committee, to expand the cam
pus resources for student social 
involvement. Activities will in
clude service projects like the 
Cal Tech smog control project, 
tutorials, development theatre 
programs with ghetto students, 
and more seminars and speak
ers similar to the Alienation 
and Identity Symposium now 
being sponsored by the YM & 
WCA.
The committee needs the as
sistance of all students inter
ested in forming and taking 
part in a well-planned program 
to develop social awareness 
on the campus. The Social Ser
vices Committee is open to all 
members of the C-MU commun
ity who are concerned that 
modern man is becoming too in
sensitive, depersonalized, and 
narrow. The committee wishes 
to involve the members of the
Honorary Sponsors 
Military Ball
On March ninth the Castle and 
Flag military honorary society 
will again sponsor the annual 
Military Ball of Carnegie-Mellon 
University. The ball is open to 
the entire C-MU community and 
is the highlight of the year for 
the 400 cadets of the ROTC bri
gade here. The Ball will again

Apathy Seminar 
To Examine Cultures
A students apathetic feelings 
about his university experience 
may, according to Dr. Peggy 
Sanday, Assistant Professor of 
Anthropology, indicate some 
stifling pressures in his environ
ment. To understand these pres
sures Dr. Sanday recommends 
examining three cultures 
which affect the student: 1) the 
American culturefelt through 
goals stressed by the family; 2) 
the University cultureexperi
enced through goals stressed by 
administration and faculty; and 
3) the student culture  exper
ienced through goals stressed 
by peers. Today, these cultures 
often reward social and biologi
cal competence without valuing 
the whole unique individual in
cluding his intellectual and per
sonal growth. The result of 
such one-sided emphasis may be 
to stifle the individual.
Student apathy and the pres
sures that produce it will be 
discussed in a group meeting 
with Dr. Sanday, Wednesday, 
February 21st, at 6:30 pm in 
room 40 Skibo. The seminar, 
Apathy II, will include a panel 
of Dr. Sandays students and 
will be open to any interested 
member of the C-MU commun
ity as part of the Alienation 
and Identity Symposium.
