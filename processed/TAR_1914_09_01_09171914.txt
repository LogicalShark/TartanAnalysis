Steffens comes here with an excellent 
reputation. Entering the University 
of Chicago in 1905, he captained and 
played quarterback for the freshman 
team and lead them on to a champion
ship; 1906 and 1907 saw him playing 
Km the Varsity. His sterling play in 
1907 earned him the captaincy for the 
following year. The season of 1908 
capped the climax for the close of one 
)f the most brilliant careers that any 
man has made at Chicago. Chicago

The annual field day program Fri
day, September 19th, will commence 
with the welcoming address by Direc
tor Hamerschlag in the theatre of the 
Design School at eleven oclock. This 
should be of especial interest to the 
plebes and all members of the incom
ing class are urged to attend.
The program for the afternoon ath
letic contests in the afternoon has not 
yet been definitely settled. It will in
clude heavy, medium, and light weight 
wrestling contests, field hockey, relay 
race, Indian ball, hand to hand and 
rope tug of war. If a push ball can 
be obtained, a contest will be staged. 
There will also probably be a peerade 
with the band.
The evening event will be a dramatic 
festival, somewhat of the nature of that 
held last year, but on a much larger 
scale. There will be Indian dances, 
followed by a sham battle, and then 
the council of peace in company with 
the Seniors with the pipe .of peace. 
The hatchet will be buried and then 
there will be eats. The band will be 
present and also, it is hoped, the entire 
Margaret Morrison School.
The festival will be under the direc
tion of Prof. Stevens of the Dramatic 
School. There will be a few speaking 
parts but all members of all classes 
will take part in full costume. A large 
supply of fire works have been or
dered and everything will be done to 
make the affair a success as it surely 
will be, judging from years before.

The Summer School of Surveying 
at Camp Louise Carnegie is again in 
full swing. Twenty-seven miles up the 
Allegheny river a group of nineteen 
tents house seventy odd Carnegie stu
dents, their teachers and cooks. Be
ginning August 27th, the camp has 
been busily at work, studying survey
ing on the seven hundred and fifty acre 
Ingleside Farm owned by the school.
This year the Industries School is 
represented at camp for the first time, 
the building construction, machine 
construction, and electrical students 
taking the minor surveying course. The 
teaching staff includes the professors 
of the Civil Engineering department, 
Prof. Duvell and Mr. Lightcap from 
Industries, with Dr. Day of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School, in charge 
of the camp. The Sanitary Engineers 
are also represented by Mr. Miller and 
water analyst Krampert, who have 
their hands full in making and keeping 
a thoroughly sanitary and hygienic 
camp. Some rather strange results in 
Kramperts analyses were mystifying 
to the experts until they learned the 
water had been saturated with carbide 
the night before by some practical 
joker.
The camp seems different this year 
in many ways. One is the absence of 
flies in the newly screened mess pavil
ion. Another is the abandonment of 
the mansion house and the nightly 
dance for an instrument shed and in
struction tent nearer the sleeping 
quarters of the campers. The feeding 
is still the reward of each days labor, 
seventeen loaves of bread per meal, but 
for camp feeding last years chef still 
holds the palm.
To the newcomer here, the thing 
first noticed is perhaps the remarkably 
clean and tidy conditions of the camp; 
but that is not obtained without work. 
Every day one of the Senior Civils is 
appointed Officer of the Day. With a 
fatigue party of three or four under
classmen, this officer has charge of the 
camp, inspects all the tents and re
ports any bad or especially good ones 
in his evening record of the day, diContinued on Page 3
The new Department of Printing, 
School of Applied Industries, which 
opens today for initial instruction to 
a limited group of day students, has 
already won nation-wide recognition 
among the printing trades-people. Just 
before the close of the last school 
year, a committee of representative 
printers from all parts of the coun
try came to visit the schools. The 
equipment had hardly arrived, and a 
preliminary course wtfs under way, 
offering instruction to about forty 
night students. The members of the 
committee were so impressed with 
what they saw and with the outline 
of the proposed wrork as given by Di
rector Hammerschlag and Dean Connelley, they took home a favorable 
report to their respective bodies. The 
result was that it was only a short 
time until the department was offi
cially recognized by the United Typothetae and the Franklin Clubs of 
America.
The Franklin Clubs are composed 
of a majority of the more important 
printers, engravers, binders and allied 
interests of this country. The pres
ent school of printing at Indianapolis 
will now cease to receive the official 
support of the Typothetae, and Car
negie becomes a veritable University 
of Printing for the entire United 
States. This organization is sending 
notices of their action throughout the 
country. The following is an extract:
At the very moment when the com
mittee on apprentices was consider
ing the problem1 of a more highly de
veloped technical school than the one 
at Indianapolis has been or could be
come, even with a large expenditure 
of money, the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, after many years of de
liberation, decided to open a depart
ment of printing. This department 
began partial operation with even
ing continuation classes in February 
of 1914. The equipment has only 
just been completed and announce
ment made of the regular opening of 
the department at the beginning of 
the fall term of the Institute. Backed 
by its immense endowment and the 
practically unlimited teaching facili
ties of its many scientific departments,

GREETING.
To the faculty and students of Car
negie, The Tartan extends a cordial 
greeting upon the opening of another 
school year. During the three months 
which have elapsed since our last 
meeting, we have been widely separ
ated throughout the entire world and 
our experiences have been as varied 
as were the natures of our vacations. 
For many, there was no rest at all, but 
merely a continuation of work in an
other form and atmosphere. For 
some, the summer was a continual 
round of pleasure, while to a few it 
presented the opportunity of witness
ing the opening struggles of one of the 
world's most disastrous wars. But 
whatever has been our lot, we have 
assembled again to resume our studies. 
For the next ten months, we shall be 
together, united in a common endeavor 
to acquire a liberal education.
To the new students especially is 
our hand of welcome stretched forth. 
We appreciate the difficulties with 
which they will be confronted until 
they have accustomed themselves to 
their new environment, but we urge 
them to be patient and persevering. 
Since their registration as students of 
this institute they have become a part 
of it. Upon taking their place in our 
student body, they should realize the 
obligations they have assumed and 
they should join the others in main
taining the standards of the school, as 
well as in developing a spirit of loy
alty to their future Alma Mater that 
is characteristic of only true sons of 
Carnegie.
A TRIPLE ALLIANCE.
According to the plan announced 
before the closing of school last 
spring, the practice of hazing the 
plebes has been abolished in the Sci
ence School. Instead, the Senior Class 
has established a number of plebe 
customs, published elsewhere in this
issue. These regulations will be 
strictly enforced, not with the pur
pose of bullying the new students, but 
merely of restricting their privileges 
to create in them a sense of respect 
for upper-classmen, in much the same 
manner that the youngest member of 
a happy family is led to regard his 
older brothers who enjoy rights de
nied to him.
The Tartan heartily approves the 
sensible spirit shown by the Science 
School, yet it regrets the fact that the 
same attitude has not been adopted 
by the other schools. In the final 
issue of this paper last year, the sug
gestion was made that the three mens 
schools co-operate in changing the 
policy of hazing at Carnegie. But 
the suggestion was either unnoticed 
or unheeded. However, if theres a 
will, there is still a way for concerted 
action on the question involved. In 
the modern war parlance we believe 
the time is ripe for the formation of 
a 'triple alliance consisting of the 
Science, Design and Industries 
Schools.
SUGGESTIONS FOR 1915 COM
MENCEMENT PLANS.
Since the 1914 Commencement last 
June, the Administrative Council of 
the Institute has met to discuss ways 
and means for improving the annual 
Commencement Week exercises. Af
ter much thought and careful consid
eration, and with the hope of creating 
more interest and enthusiasm among 
the students, the following sugges
tions regarding the 1915 Commence
ment plans have been proposed: First, 
that the Baccalaureate address be 
given at eleven oclock on the Sun
day morning preceding the Com
mencement exercises, in the theater 
of the Design School building. Sec
ond, that a Sunday evening Sacred 
concert be given by the orchestra of 
the Department of Music on the same 
evening as the Baccalaureate address, 
in the theater of the Design School 
building. Third, that the final sec
ond semester examinations for under
classmen be scheduled up to noon on 
Class Day. Fourth, that an invoca
tion be included on the program of 
the Commencement Exercises next 
year. And fifth, that it be suggested 
to the Senior Classes that the Senior 
dances next year be scheduled before 
June first.
ANNOUNCEMENT.
The Tartan announces the resigna
tion of Mr. H. Knight from its edi
torial staff. Mr. Knight had been 
connected with the paper for nearly 
two years and became athletic editor 
last spring. His decision not to re
turn to school, necessitated his with
drawal from The Tartan board. Mr. 
W. M. Sheldon, a senior of the Science 
School, will have charge of the ath
letic department. He will be assisted 
by Mr. E. G. Hamilton who was a 
member of the Tartan board of 1912- 
1913.
DEPT. OF PRINTING
Continued from Page 1
able to offer to its students a techni
cal training in the graphic arts far su
perior to any which can now be pro
vided by any other institution in the 
United States. It is able to supple
ment the actual teaching of printing 
by instruction in mechanics, physics, 
chemistry, art and all other related 
subjects necessary to a really scien
tific knowledge of all the processes 
involved.
During the summer, Mr. Gage, 
Head of the Department of Printing, 
has been travelling throughout the 
East and has arranged for a series of 
lectures, some of which will be given 
before the entire student body, by 
prominent printers and engravers 
from all over the country.
FOOTBALL.
Football season has again arrived, 
the first practice having been held last 
Monday, a squad of twenty-five hav
ing reported. It is too early as yet to 
prospect as to the quality of this 
years team as it is not definitely 
known who will return or what pros
pect there is for new material. The 
squad has been kept busy all this week 
both morning and afternoon as it is 
the intention of Coach Steffens to 
work the men hard in preparation for 
the opening game with Waynesburg, 
at Tech Field on October 3.
Coach Steffens will drill the men in 
the Western style of play in contrast 
to the Eastern style as heretofore used. 
This will tend to much faster and more 
open ball and will make a much more 
interesting game to watch. It will not 
be the big man who will count but he 
with the greatest amount of nerve, 
judgment and speed.
The schedule favors the student 
body as the only game played away 
from home is that with Lehigh on Oc
tober 17th. It is to be hoped that 
those in the student body not out for 
the team will give it all the support 
possible both at practice and at the 
games. He is a poor sport indeed who 
cannot even support the team from 
the bleachers.
Arrangements are now being car
ried through for a training house 
which will probably be in shape by the 
first of October. This is one of the 
greatest assets that a team can have 
and it is much to be desired that the 
management shall feel financially able 
to support a house.
Coach Steffens, Captain McCaughey 
and Manager Round will be at the 
Field House each practice to welcome 
all candidates and furnish them with 
suits. All men who have ever played 
or who are desirous of learning are 
urged to report.
The jerseys and stockings as will be 
used on the future teams have been 
changed. The old color of blue with 
red stripes has been replaced by a 
grey body with stripes of the colors 
of the four schools on the sleeves or 
legs.

STUDENTS AT CAMP
Continued from Page 1
rects the fatigue party in any work 
they may do, sees that they clean all 
the lanterns, pick up the waste and 
keep a roaring fire going. So the of
ficer is a big man.
The camp is operated by a little bell 
on the flag post. At 6:30 it rings the 
rising hour, at 7:00 A. M., 12:15 P. M. 
and 6:00 P. M. it announces a session 
in the mess house and at 10 P. M. it 
orders quiet in camp. The mess calls 
are always answered by a stampede up 
the hill, but the other two are not so 
well obeyed.
One Friday evening the campers 
were the guests of Mr. Seitz at his 
moving picture and vaudeville show in 
the metropolis of Freeport (population 
2900); and ever since half the camp 
may be found in the town of an even
ing. There are some nice people in 
Freeport, so they say.
On Wednesday, September 9th, the 
moving picture collection of the school 
was supplemented by several camp 
pictures. The bunch rush was 
taken twice, once before and once af
ter the mid-day meal. Needless to 
say, the first was by far the more ener
getic. High noon witnessed the photo
graphing of a night camp fire scene, 
and then the picture of the bunch go
ing out to work filled up an hour of 
working time.
Of course two weeks of camp results 
in the usual number of tales of mis
haps and incidents. A few Sundays 
ago Curly Lauer and Irish Cun
ningham took a canoe up the river 
and came back minus their clothes 
which were left in the river. The hy
draulic party enjoyed the paddling up 
the rapids, especially Roberts, who had 
to pull the canoe half a mile bare leg
ged in the water. Again a rowboat 
party spent several hours paddling 
around in a circle one night in a heavy 
fog, arriving at camp only after they 
thought they had gone to Pittsburgh.
The Junior Civils are an especially 
bright crowd of embryo engineers. 
Dodge knows everything about a level 
after entirely dismantling one at the 
peril of his breakage fee. But it wasn't 
his fault. They told him to clean it 
and the best way to do that was to 
take it all apart, wasnt it? Again, 
Kreiger spent an afternoon hunting a 
stake only to find that his partner, 
Levine, was sitting on it.
The last few nights have been cold, 
but that is what makes camp worth 
remembering. But two good blankets 
and all the coats one possesses are 
enough to keep one warm.
The other evening we thought we 
had a visitor from the five hundred as 
a dandy swung his cane along Mess 
alley, but someone discovered it was 
only Johnson. Johnson keeps his cane 
locked in his trunk.
A new football game has been de
veloped here, but its rules are quite 
easy in that they are anything one 
wishes. A good wrestling match oc
curred this evening between Frey and 
Krampert. Frey held out against his 
opponents 42 extra pounds for over 
five minutes.
Despite all the fun, the camp surely 
is a splendid place to take surveying. 
Spending several weeks from 8:00 A. 
M. to 5 P. M. in the field teaches one 
much more than he could get in count
less laboratory periods at school. And 
the spirit of the place is full of sur
veying. Everybody talks it. A little 
bit of another kind of spirit would suit 
some. Ask Irish Cunningham or 
Curly Lauer about the picnic.
MUSICAL CLUBS ELECT DI
RECTOR.
The officers of the Musical Clubs 
met during the last week of June and 
elected Sgn. Gregorio Scalzo as the 
director of the combined Clubs for 
1914-1915.
Sgn. Scalzo has been director of the 
Mandolin Club since 1910. His won
derful ability as a mandolinist and 
conductor of music has won him fame 
throughout Southern Europe, South 
America and the States. In the Pitts
burgh district, he has been connected 
with all the leading musical organiza
tions. The success of this branch of 
school activities in the past has been 
largely due to his concentrated efforts 
and extraordinary skill.
Formerly the Glee Club and Mando
lin Club has each had its own director. 
With all due respect to those who are 
responsible for the wonderful work 
accomplished in 1913-1914, there is 
no reason why this years organization 
under its new policy should not com
plete the acquirements of the past and 
add its share to the already well es
tablished renown of the Carnegie Mu
sical Clubs.
BAND NOTICE.
The first meeting of the Band will 
be held Thursday, September 17, at 
4:30 P. M., in the new Industries build
ing. All men who play band instru
ments are urged to come out and help 
support the band. A cordial invita
tion is extended to the Plebes who will 
find it to their advantage to do this 
as they come in contact with upper 
classmen, and also get in touch with 
the school activities. A man need not 
be an expert musician in order to join 
the band, as we have engaged a com
petent director, who is willing to in
struct any one who may desire it.
As to the student body as a whole 
we ask you to take a greater interest 
in the band this year than ever before, 
and we feel that if this is done the 
band men will more than repay you by 
their efforts to make this the best 
Band in the history of the school.
No school is complete without a 
good band so it is up to you men who 
play band instruments to shine em 
up and be on hand Thursday at the 
first rehearsal so that we can get a 
good start for this years work. Dont 
forget we are to play for the Fall Fes
tival on Friday.

THE GIRLS AT CAMP LOUISE 
CARNEGIE.
From the guests standpoint, Camp 
was a success. It is hoped that the 
management, for the sake of next 
summer, will also pronounce it a suc
cess.
Perhaps the two weeks that I lived 
at Camp were typical ones, or pos
sibly, being the last of all, they were 
the wonderful climax. At least every
one longed for the fun to go on for 
more days and weeks.
These are some of the enjoyments: 
First, the big house, fresh with its 
new paint, with comfortable cots and 
chairs and swings; then the meals 
indescribable, save to say they were 
well received and completely disposed 
of; of course there were the girl-i, 
twenty or thirty at a time, and that 
means much joy in itself; and in near
by tents, the boysa half dozen or 
so, good company and on occasion, 
useful. There were movies in 
town, swimming parties daily and 
some times nightly, moonlight for 
hayrack rides and corn roasts, marsh
mallow toasts, a birthday masquerade 
party, a surprise stunt party, canoeing, 
driving, riding and hiking, not to 
mention a coal mine expedition, and 
always the victrola and dancing.
Over against this, the list of de
fects is short, something like this: a 
rough tennis court, a stony river bed, 
a long, dark walk home from town, 
a three-day rain, a chaperone blowing 
the come in bugle long before any
body wanted to, the victrola broken 
down for two days, a horse that threw 
her riders, and for everyone the end 
of the week when it was time to go 
home.
A stranger might imagine from this 
that there were no moments of quiet 
about Camp. It was not a ceaseless 
round of activity. There were some 
quiet dreamy days when a girl stayed 
in with a book, or wandered out to a 
lovely hillside when she stretched her
self on a blanket and watched and 
listened and rested. The beauties of 
the hills and the fields and the river 
are not the least of the Camps attrac
tions.
We may show you later some snap 
shots of Camp life and they tell a 
happy story. The girls at Camp this 
summer, grateful to the powers that 
made a delightful vacation possible, 
say they are going next year, and the 
girls who werent there, are going 
too.
Many of the members of the Mar
garet Morrison faculty were abroad 
during the summer and after varied 
exciting experiences succeeded in re
turning to this country, all but Miss 
Lyons, who was traveling in Germany, 
via steerage. Miss Stoner, who was 
studying at the School of Rythmic 
Dancing in Dresden, was at Rotter
dam at last report, but had not been 
able to secure passage.
Miss Vermocken, of the History de
partment, returned from Switzerland.
Miss Hurmann, of the department of 
Costume Economics, returned from 
Germany and Switzerland.
Miss Anderson, of the Cooking de, 
partment, crossed from Sweden.
Dr. Breed returned from Paris and 
Switzerland, leaving her trunks in 
Paris.
The School has opened a new dormi
tory at 5045 Fifth avenue which 
will materially increase the num
ber of girls that can be 
housed under proper chaperonage. The 
house is a large residence between 
Morewood and Amberson avenues and 
is surrounded by spacious grounds, 
making an ideal site for a dormitory.
Miss Collingwood will remain in 
charge of the dormitory on Morewood 
avenue.
It is expected that the new addition 
to the school will be ready for occu
pancy in time for the first classes 
Thursday morning. A few of the de
partments will be temporarily incon
venienced, however. The department 
of Household Economics will have 
one kitchen, a classroom and an office 
for the present.
MISS ADAH HOPKINS WILL BE 
THE HEAD OF THE NEW 
DEPARTMENT OF SO
CIAL SERVICE.
Miss Adah Hopkins, the head of the 
new Department of Social Service in 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School, is one of the most important 
additions to our Faculty list. Miss 
Hopkins has been in charge of the 
County Organized Charities of Grinnell, Iowa, and has also been a mem
ber of the Faculty of Grinnell College. 
She was for several years connected 
with the School of Philanthropy in 
New York City, and has therefore had 
wide and varied experience both as 
teacher and as social worker and in
vestigator.
The courses at the Margaret Mor
rison Carnegie School give the girls 
theoretical training in Sociology and 
the general field of social work, com
bined with much field work in connec
tion with the city and county organ
ization. It is expected that the stu
dents will be well equipped also in 
office management, and that many of 
them will be qualified in sanitary sci
ence as well.
Miss Hopkins came to Pittsburgh 
July first and spent a large part of 
the summer studying the city and 
county work for social welfare. She 
has already made a place for herself 
here and will be a power in the com
munity. Her personality lends great 
force to her work.
It is quite possible that these cours
es in social service will attract many 
graduates of colleges to the School 
for training on modern philanthropic 
lines and for the practical experience 
given by the field work.
Another important expansion of the 
work at the Margaret Morrison Car
negie School is under the direction of 
Mr. J. E. Rush, lately of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, and 
of the University of Wisconsin. Mr. 
Rush is organizing courses in bacteri
ology and public health.
AT LAST!
Unannounced by the blare of trum
pets and in a quiet and unostentatious 
manner considering the importance of 
the occasion, an event occurred yes
terday morning of unimagined import
ance to the students of Tech, towards 
which their thoughts had been turning 
for many a year with watering mouths 
and aching stomachs. The new Bean
ery opened its doors and entered upon 
its career of service.
The location of this latest addition to 
the comforts of the students is the new 
Head House, where it fills the entire 
basement. The restaurant fills one 
large room, taking in the whole width 
of the building and well lighted and 
aired, and the kitchen occupies another 
large room in the rear. Walls and 
floor are of cement with large concrete 
posts upholding the ceiling.
All furnishings and equipment are 
entirely new, no expense having been 
spared to make it of the latest and 
most improved type. The tables have 
carrera glass tops the long serving 
table is of tile. On the latter are ovens 
and heated pots for holding the vic
tuals. In the kitchen the most effi
cient apparatus possible. Automatic 
dish washers, potato peelers, egg' boil
ers, bread cutters, etc., are there, ad 
infinitum. Large refrigerators and 
ranges have been provided. Gas is 
furnished free by the school.
It is entirely due to the untiring ef
forts of the Director and his deep in
terest in the comforts of the students 
that they are enabled to have the ben
efits of the equipment. It was the 
desire of Director Hamerschlag that 
evertyhing possible should be done in 
order to decrease the cost of service 
to as low a degree as possible and how 
well he has succeeded can be attested 
to by the students themselves. It is 
figured that 88 per cent of the amount 
paid per meal is actually value re
ceived, only twelve per cent going to 
service. The thanks of the student 
body are due the director for his in
terest.
The seating capacity will be three 
hundred. Miss Adams, former ma
tron of the Dorm, will be in charge. 
Luncheon will be served from 11:30 
to 2:00 and dinner from 5:30 till 7:00. 
The cost of all meals will be twenty 
cents. This price will fluctuate with 
the cost of living. All meals will be 
table dhote, the cafeteria style having 
been abolished. Individual service will 
be retained.
Only the best quality of foodstuffs 
will be served. The menu will be un
der the direct approval of Dr. Esquerre, Head of the Department of 
Student Health, who will personally 
inspect the Beanery each morning. 
The slogan of the new force might be 
said to be The best grub at the lowest 
price.
The co-operation of the student body 
will be necessary of course if the hopes 
of the administration are to be ful
filled. It is to be hoped that the pat
ronage will be large and orderly and 
that the students will do all in their 
power to show their appreciation to 
the Director for the success of his 
plans.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
THE CLOSING DAYS OF 1914.
The past year in the School of Ap
plied Industries came to a close in a 
round of festivities such as had never 
been witnessed in this school before. 
There were a number of things that 
happened that mark the past year as 
being the banner year of this schools 
existence.
There was an awakening in the 
athletics of the institute; in our rep
resentation on the various boards of 
control and management; in the Tar
tan and Thistle; in the musical clubs 
and in fact all of the activities of the 
institute in general, both in athletics 
and the other clubs and organizations 
supported by the student body.
This awakening marks the passing 
of the old regime in this school and 
the present year will usher in the be
ginning of a new era in the School of 
Applied Industries, most of the men 
who were elected as assistant mana
gers last year will be on the job again 
this year as will the majority of the 
members of the various organizations 
of which they were members.
For the first time in the history of 
the school the senior class gave a ball 
following the class day exercises 
which was a grand success. It was 
held in the Physics lab. in the uppei 
wing of the A. I. building. The room 
had been decorated for the occasion 
and Neagleys Concert Orchestra fur
nished vocal and instrumental music 
that kept the dancing lively and full 
of life. The faculty and alumni were 
present as well as the students and 
friends of the school and officers of 
the administration, refreshments were 
served throughout the evening and in 
general it was one of the most enjoy
able affairs ever held by the students 
of this school.
The class day programme was 
one that was well arranged and 
also one of variety. The gradu
ating class marched through the 
corridors singing the Amici until they 
reached the entrance to the assembly 
room where they gave a short speller 
and then came in all in a bunch. Mr. 
Adolph Schtz presided at the piano 
and delighted the assembled guests 
with several of his excellent selections 
after which Mr. Phil. H. More read 
the class oration the subject of which 
was Industrial Education, and the 
manner in which he presented his 
views showed that he well understood 
his subject. This was followed by the 
Past and Future of the night and 
day classes and the programme con
cluded with motion pictures of the 
schools and the singing of the Alma 
Mater.
This in general is a compact state
ment of the pep that has shown 
itself in this school during the last 
year and it is the result of the stu
dent assemblies which were held all 
of last year, bringing the fellows to
gether discussing the affairs of inter
est and boosting acquaintance and 
friendship and giving to all a desire
for a BIGGER AND BETTER In
dustries and if there is anything in 
signs we are on the road to success.
What the incoming class of fresh
men will develop into will have to be 
seen as yet, but if they possess any
thing like the last class, the movement 
will accelerate with a jump that will 
make the entire student body of the 
Institute sit up and take notice.

THE APPLIED INDUSTRIES 
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.
The Annual Banquet of the Alumni 
held on June 13, 1914, at the Fort Pitt 
Hotel, proved to be the greatest so
cial gathering held so far by the Asso
ciation. The event consisted of sev
enty jolly graduates, five good speak
ers, good music, eats and smokes.
The speaker of the evening, C. L. E. 
Cartwright, Ph. D., was unable to be 
with us on account of a death in the 
family, and ex-President A. E. Ham
ilton, because of an operation which 
took place a few days previous. The 
speakers were such notables as Pro
fessor R. J. Peters, toastmaster; Dr. 
A. A. Hamerschlag, Dean C. B. Connelley, Prof. J. T. Morris, Prof. W. M. 
Pfouts, and Fred Hartman, Assistant 
to the Dean A few members of the 
Alumni were also called upon to make 
their speeches.
After the banquet, a business meet
ing was held and the following mem
bers were elected to hold office for 
1914-15: W. H. Ritts, president; C. L. 
Otto, vice president; B. A. Lutton, 
secretary; W. M. Ball, Jr., treasurer; 
Board of Governors, E. F. Heuber, 
N. Martin, S. G. Little, T. J. Dempsey, 
L. Haas, F. W. Mack, B. J. Patterson, 
A. J. Glynn and W. K. Monks.
An entertainment committee has 
been appointed to look after all af
fairs to be held by the Association, 
so that wonderful things are being 
looked forward to in the near future.
We wish to become acquainted with 
all the undergrads and to be of any 
assistance possible to these men.
Best wishes to all those connected 
with the Institute for a very success
ful year.
COACH STEFFENS RECORD
Continued from Page 1
won the Western Championship al
most entirely through the individual 
play of their quarterback and Steffens 
won a place on Walter Camps mythi
cal all-American eleven. Commenting 
upon the selection of Steffens, Camp 
says: Steffens is a remarkable gen
eral possessing a marvelous driving 
power and ability to use the right play 
at the right time; as a player he is 
active, fast, untiring and cool and 
easily stands head and shoulder above 
all the candidates for the pivotal posi
tion. Combine this opinion of such 
a football expert as Camp together 
with the fact that Steffens was a West
ern man (Camp selects very few West
ern men for his teams) and we can 
readily see that Steffens must have 
been truly a remarkable player. West
ern experts have also ranked him on 
a par with Eckersall and Heston.

From 1909 until 1912 Steffens was 
engaged as an assistant to Coach 
Stagg at Chicago. He has taught the 
fast open Western play which should 
be so adaptable to our men. He has 
shown that he is a conscientious work
er and a good coach. Of him, Stagg 
says: Steffens is well able to coach 
and direct a team. Above all he is a 
prince among fellows and is a man 
that one is justly proud to have as an 
acquaintance. His efforts have always 
been crowned with success and we feel 
confident that they will be met with 
the same fate here. We welcome you, 
Coach Steffens, and you have our 
heartiest wishes for a long string of 
triumphs.

DESIGN NOTES
Professors Geoghegan, the acting 
dean, Prof. Malcherck, and Prof. Sollom, who were abroad at the opening 
of the war, have just been heard from 
and will return by the opening of 
school. There was much anxiety 
among the students as it was feared 
that they might have felt the call of 
battle and enlisted.
Mr. Koil, instructor in. architecture, 
will not arrive until the last of this 
year. He is at present studying at 
Rome, having received the American 
Academy at Rome prize, while a stu
dent at the University of Pennsyl
vania.
Mr. Douglas Ross will be assistant 
professor of dramatic art.
Prof. Leonard, a recent appointment 
to the Faculty, is a graduate of the 
Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, and 
has lately been associated with Flagg 
of New York.
The organ in the theater is almost 
completed, the keyboards only being 
lacking. A full description if this 
especially designed instrument will 
appear later.
ADDED EQUIPMENT IN ELEC
TRICAL DEPARTMENT.
The High Tension laboratory in the 
north wing of the Electrical Depart
ment, Machinery Hall, has been equip
ped with a 100 K. V. A. 200,000-volt 
transformer.
There has been ordered a complete 
electric railway outfit, consisting of 
a pair of standard traction motors, 
each geared to an inertia wheel with 
a Pony Brake. The motors have two 
methods of control; the hand con
troller, as used in the ordinary city 
street car, and the electro-pneumatic 
control as is used in the newest types 
of interurban cars.
Included with the rest of the equip
ment added this summer, there arrived 
the electrical twins, a daughter to 
Prof. Holcomb and a son to Prof. 
Dennison, both born on the same day.
GIFT FROM BELL TELEPHONE 
COMPANY.
The Bell Telephone Co. has donated 
to the schools one of the first types 
of telephone switchboards ever used 
in the city, dating from the period 
of the consolidation of the Bell and 
Edison companies when the Bell had 
fifty and the Edison had thirty phones 
in operation. The board is set up in 
the electrical laboratory of the In
dustries building.
CAPT. HASELTON AT HIS HOME
The many friends of Capt. Haselton 
of the track team, who was injured 
in the Pitt meet last May, will be 
pleased to learn that he left the hos
pital the last week of August. He 
returned to his home at Saranac Lake 
(X. Y.) where he is now convalsecing. 
In a recent letter to Mr. Heyl, the 
bursar, he reported that his leg is 
steadily improving and that he is gain
ing in weight. Haselton hopes to be 
able to return to school in November.

PROF. TRINKS RETURNS FROM 
EUROPE.
For the past week or two Professor 
Trinks has been receiving the con
gratulations of his friends, and the 
student body for his miraculous es
cape from Germany, where he was 
when the war broke out. Upon the 
declaration of hostilities he tried to 
cross the channel to England but the 
water was too deep so he gave up 
the idea. He then tried to cross the 
Belgian frontier near Rio de Genaro, 
but was held up by a whole British 
artillery corps, armed with 42 cm. 
guns. Not to be daunted he told them 
a new story and while they were laugh
ing he gave them the slip, much to 
their mortification. He then made his 
way on foot to Alsace-Loraine, near 
Naples, where he was again held up, 
this time as a woman spy. The cause 
for tljis grave mistake on the part of 
the military authorities was due to the 
fact that he wore a watch on his wrist. 
However, after confiscating his clock"' 
and putting him though a vigorous 
Third Degree they marched him to 
Hoboken where he boarded a ferry 
for New York. He said upon being 
asked that he felt sure that Germany 
would declare war on France.

NEW LABORATORY FOR ME
CHANICAL ELECTRO AND 
INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY.
Equipment has arrived this summer 
which added to that already installed, 
will form a nucleus for larger and 
finer laboratory in technical electro 
and industrial chemistry than is found 
elsewhere in the country. A large 
amount of the apparatus already in
stalled is so expensive that few in
stitutions in the country can afford 
as complete an equipment as has al
ready been obtained.
The laboratory is furnished with 
six tables, especially designed by Dr. 
Janies and admirably adopted to this 
class of work. They are heavy, half 
height tables, eight feet square, split 
in the middle for connections and 
pipes for air, water, gas, and steam. 
Those for the electrical experiments 
have concrete tops for high tempera
ture work and are fitted with large 
switches and connections under one 
end. The tables for the. experiments 
in industrial chemistry have heavy 
wooden tops to facilitate the tempo
rary fastening of apparatus. Over each 
table is a large hood, that can be 
raised and lowered, and fitted with a 
damper so that the total force of the 
suction can be thrown to any one hood.
The current for the electro-chemi
cal experiments is supplied by one 
large generator set, connected to large 
bus bars passing along the side wall 
of the laboratory. Under these is a 
long table, three by sixty feet, equip
ped with sinks, air, and water con
nections.
Among the electro-chemical ap
paratus added are the following: One 
electrolizer for the preparation of 
bleached liquor; an apparatus for 
the preparation of electrolytic ox
ygen and hydrogen; an experi
mental furnace; a summons dif
fusion battery; material for setting up 
electric furnaces of various types; va
rious vats, electrodes, etc., for illus
trating industrial operations involving 
electrolysis.
The apparatus added for Industrial 
Chemistry consists of: One Cooke
two stage compressor for compress
ing gases to 3,000 pounds per square 
inch; one set of steam evaporating 
kettles, plain iron and enameled; a 
Summus distillation and extraction 
outfit; a Devine vacuum dryer; a 10- 
horse power gas fired boiler; one large 
experimental still, one-half the cost 
of which was donated by E. P. Badger
& Sons of Boston; a centrifugal crystal 
drying apparatus; a filter press; an 
Autoclave; a double effect vacuum 
evaporator, manufactured by Geo. M. 
Newhall of Philadelphia, and equipped 
with sight glasses for observation of 
various processes and all possible con
nections for any modification of an ex
periment in evaporation; one grinding 
mill for drugs; a percolator; a sifter 
and mixer for screening and mixing 
powders; a screw press; an emulsifier; 
various types of stills, samples illus
trating various kinds of apparatus 
made from acid proof stoneware, in
cluding tower packing material, pipes,
faucets, elbows and one large absorb
ing vessel all donated by M. A. Knight 
of Akron, Ohio.
With the above equipment and un
der the expert tutilage of Dr. James, 
lech will have a course that cannot be 
bettered by any institution in the coun
try. Dr. James will have the classes 
in Industrial Chemistry and Mr. 
Yount, taose in 'iecnmcal Electro 
Chemistry.
