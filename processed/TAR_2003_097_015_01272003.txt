Anti-war rally draws thousands
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
Yesterday, 75 year-old Pittsburgh 
resident Caryl Beal set her handbag 
down on Fifth Avenue, lay down on 
the sodden cement, and folded her 
hands together across her body. Beal 
stayed that way, motionless, for fif
teen minutes while snow continued 
to fall. She was one of about 150 
other protestors who participated in 
the die-in, an act of civil disobedi
ence in show of opposition to the war
I kept thinking, said Beal. I real
ly feel strongly that we should not go 
to war.
A few thousand other protestors 
marched yesterday in opposition to 
war with Iraq. The protest, organized 
by various local groups including the 
Thomas Merton Center, and the 
Pittsburgh Organizing Group, was 
one of several dozen events held in 
Oaldand since Friday, including street 
theatre, vigils, live music, lectures, 
and free food, packed into a threeday-long event entitled The 
Regional Convergence Against War. 
Police barricaded Forbes and Fifth 
Avenue between Craig St. and 
Bigelow, and allowed protestors to 
march and demonstrate.
Federal agents were there to inves
tigate a tip that alluded to assasinating the President, said Michael 
Healey, a lawyer who represents 
activists who was at the protest pri
marily to observe and get a sense of 
what well need to do if people are 
arrested. A flier advocating the 
assassination of President Bush, 
found last week, brought in a greater 
number of secret servicemen, he said. 
The flier read, Kill Bush: Take to the 
Streets for Vengeance. Tim Vining, 
executive director for the Thomas 
Merton Center, said none of the 
groups who organized the protest 
were involved in making that flier.
We believe that was an attempt to 
distract us away from our message,

Drop Bush, Not Bombs!
Hundreds of Pittsburgh residents and visitors gathered outside the Carnegie 
Mellon Software Engineerng Institute for a protest march as part of the Regional 
Convergence Against War in Oakland this weekend (above).
Street theatre Sunday (right) was one of many events during three days of protest 
marches, vigils, lectures and live music.
which is why were against the war, 
the humanitarian disaster of this 
war, said Vining.
The protest attracted people from 
out of town, as well as about 40 
Carnegie Mellon students. Nathaniel 
Wesley Filardo, first-year physics 
major, held a sign that read, Disarm 
CMU. According to Filardo, 
Carnegie Mellon stands to gain from 
Bushs war on Iraq because of the 
software engineering institutes 
defense contract with the US govern
ment.
My sign is to discourage them 
from making money at the expense 
of American lives, said Filardo.
A group of CMU students met in 
Kirr Commons and went to the 
protest, which began at the Pitt 
Student Union Lawn, chanting, 
Drop Bush, Not Bombs.
People came from other parts of 
Pennsylvania,and from Ohio and 
Connecticut. Marisa Niemiece drove 
two hours from West Union, West
Virginia, with five people from her 
church group. Niemiece, 26, said she 
came out because protesting is what 
she can do to make a difference.
One of my frustrations is I feel 
like there are so many people who 
oppose the war who just arent com
ing together, said Niemiece.
Various groups spoke and were 
present, including local churches, 
Green party supporters, proPalestinian groups, and womens 
rights organizations. Kareem
Howard, who works for the National 
Council for Urban Peace and Justice, 
said domestic concerns are more of a 
threat than Saddam Hussein.
Were trying to get rid of the 
weapons of mass destruction that 
plague our neighborhoods such as 
drugs, such as unemployment, and 
homelessness, said Howard.

from Spain, said she may not be a US

Legacies float 
to top of CMU 
admission list
by Nick Ennis
Staffwriter
Most universities, including 
Carnegie Mellon, use affirmative 
action plans to create a diverse stu
dent body. Affirmative action 
increases the acceptance rates of 
many minorities such as women, 
African-Americans and Hispanics, 
but no group receives more favorable 
special attention than the legacies, or 
children of alumni. Last year 66 per
cent of legacies were admitted to 
Carnegie Mellon, compared to 38 
percent of the entire applicant pool.
The office of admissions awards up 
to four points in four different cate
gories to gauge applicants: 
Academic, Test scores, Non-aca
demic, and Special Consideration. 
Legacy status falls into Special 
Consideration. Late in the admis
sions process, counselors use these 
four values as a guideline in evaluat
ing the applicant.
According to William Elliott, vice 
president of enrollment, legacy stu
dents are looked upon favorably 
because of their familys loyalty to the 
University. However, he stressed that 
the points awarded to each applicant 
were not the only factor in making an 
admissions decision.
Preference is not only given to the 
sons and daughters of former stu
dents; special consideration is award
ed to all applications with some affil
iation to the University. Children of 
faculty and staff are admitted at 
almost the same rate as legacies. 
According to Elliott, groups given 
extra consideration include relatives 
of trustees and pre-college partici
pants.
The situation is no different at

ROTC students 
prepare for 
impending war
by Erin Stock
Staffwriter
A US-led war against Iraq might 
call some CMU students to task. More 
than two dozen students graduating 
this year through ROTC programs 
will be commissioned as officers in 
the Army, Navy, or Air Force, and, in 
return for scholarships, will serve in 
the military for a minimum term of 
four years.
For certain occupations, [naval 
ROTC midshipmen] could find them
selves getting orders directly from 
here to a ship that will be in a combat 
zone overseas, said Mark Craig, 
associate professor of Naval Science 
at Carnegie Mellon. It really comes 
down to how serious things get.
According to Craig, in peacetime, 
naval ROTC graduates are commis
sioned as officers in the Navy or 
Marines, and then begin training in 
their specific branch. If war with Iraq 
ensues, Craig said, More than likely, 
things could be streamlined.
After being commissioned, officers 
could receive orders to serve in the 
war.
He said students who have not yet 
graduated would not be called upon 
to serve, even during wartime. The 
same goes for Air Force ROTC and 
Army ROTC. Scott Boyd, comman
dant of cadets for the air force ROTC, 
said, In general, as they are students, 
any conflict, any war, does not affect 
them.
Eric Trainer, senior military science 
instructor at the University of 
Pittsburgh, said that in the event of a 
war, he doubts officers will see com
bat soon after graduation, even after 
they are commissioned^
In order for an officer to function 
in his particular branch, he has to 
study it first, and those things arent 
cut short for anything, he said.
Justin Gerle, a senior psychology 
major who has a two-year scholarship 
from Naval ROTC, will be in 
Pensacola, FL after graduation, train
ing to be a Naval aviator. Gerle said 
there is little chance hell be in com
bat soon, since Naval aviation takes a 
lot of additional training.
For the surface warfare officers, 
once theyre commissioned, they 
could go over, said Gerle.
Gerle said the possibility of war 
with Iraq has affected him and his fel
low midshipmen.

Aid reform may impact 
Higher Education Act
Nordenbergs gift defuses PR crisis
by Will Minton
Junior Staffwriter
The collective protest of hun
dreds of University of Pittsburgh 
students, faculty, and staff of 
Chancellor Mark Nordenbergs pay 
raise is in murky waters after the 
Chancellor announced last Friday a 
$50,000 out-of-pocket donation to 
the university. According to Dave 
Hartman, editor-in-chief of the Pitt 
News and leader of the protest 
effort, Nordenbergs donation is the 
easy way out. In a time of university-wide cutbacks and after a 14 per
cent tuition increase last fall, 
Nordenberg has accepted a 14 per
cent pay raise amounting to 
$47,500 and a $75,000 bonus for 
every year he retains his position. 
His yearly pay is now $465,000.
Despite initial support, the chal
lenge now appears to be losing 
ground. Nordenbergs donation 
remains officially unconnected to
The Chancellor Challenge.
On January 10, Hartman pub
lished a column in The Pitt News 
entitled, My Challenge for the 
Chancellor, in which he called on 
Nordenberg to give his raise back to 
the University. In return, Hartman 
pledged to donate 14 percent of his 
own salary as editor-in-chief.
Since the column was published, 
the challenge has gained the notice 
of the Pitt and Pittsburgh communi
ties. On January 16, the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette picked up the story. As 
of Hartmans follow-up column on 
January 24, over 115 pledges had 
added up to over $12,000.
Hartman is excited with the 
response he has seen so far.
Ive been here for four years and 
have never seen the campus so unit
ed over an issue; Students, faculty, 
Democrats, Republicans. Im get
ting letters of support from every
one, said Hartman.
On his desk is a two inch-high 
stack of printed out emails from
people who he says couldnt afford 
to pledge but wanted to send their 
support. Hartman insists he has 
nothing personal against the chan
cellor.
Nordenberg is one of the most 
impressive Chancellors Pitt has ever 
had, said Hartman.
Nordenberg can still come out of 
this thing a champion if he 
responds to the challenge with a 
significant donation, he said.
Hartman said it is unnacceptable 
for the Chancellor to accept this 
raise, after a tuition increase and 
when so many staff members are 
being handed one to two percent 
raises.
For him to accept the raise now. 
is really a slap in the face to the stu
dents and everyone else, said 
Hartman.
One staff member, Stacey 
Nicholson, was so frustrated with 
the insignificance of her two percent

Congress will soon vote on the 
reauthorization of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965. Packaged 
with the HEA will be House 
Resolution 4866, or the FED UP 
bill, the most recent of several cam
paigns to amend the HEA since it was 
last reauthorized six years ago.
The FED UP bill deals primarily 
with helping students pay off loans 
on time, and making financial aid 
more accessible to minorities, espe
cially Hispanic students, and homeschooled and non-traditional stu
dents.
Led by Howard P. Buck McKeon 
(R-CA) and Patsy Mink (D-HI), the 
House Education & the Workforce 
Committee has introduced the legis
lation in an attempt to streamline fed
eral red tape in the student aid sys
tem.
To help promote public thought 
and discussion on the subject, the 
Department of Education set forward 
a number of broad goals, including 
enhancing the quality of and access 
to postsecondary and adult educa
tion, establishing effective funding 
mechanisms for postsecondary edu
cation, and modernizing the 
Federal Student Aid programs and 
reduce their high-risk status.
Via the Internet, the committee 
solicited comments and proposal 
ideas from both student aid profes
sionals and the public.
The fact that we got 3,000 
responses from individuals over a 
couple months that FED UP was on 
the Internet shows how many people 
feel this is a problem, said House 
Education and the Workforce 
Committee press secretary Heather 
Valentine. Its a vital bill to securing
Americas economic future.
The bill was designed with both 
the Department of Educations origi
nal goals and the publics suggestions 
in mind.
By removing the legal requirement 
that new agreements must be in writ
ing, FED UP hopes to make secur
ing forbearance from lenders quicker 
and easier for students with loans.
It should help lower default rates 
and help them [students] pay back 
their loans...it will expedite the 
process, said David Lucas, Chief of 
Staff for US Representative Mike 
Doyle (D), who represents 
Pennsylvanias 14th district, includ
ing CMU.
One part that I think is a step in 
the right direction is it would allow 
students to more quickly arrange 
terms with the lender, he said, refer
ring to the bills plans to allow stu
dents to renegotiate the terms of 
their loans and make changes like 
delaying a payment or changing the 
payment plan over the phone (the 
student would later be required to 
use the necessary paperwork).
Generally, Congressmen Doyle 
supports [the bill], said Lucas.
Both Republicans and Democrats 
are interested in this. Theyre inter
ested in students and parents as vot
ers, said Edward Stoner, University 
Counsel.
Stoner said the FED UP bill 
would be very helpful to state schools 
and the students that attend them, 
but its effect on CMUs financial aid 
would be negligible.
The FED UP Legislation is current
ly sitting in the House Education and 
the Workforce committee. Lucas 
could not offer a timetable for the 
bill, saying that Congress often waits 
until after the Presidents State of the 
Union Address is delivered before it 
begins most of its work.

Neighbors urge 
Iraq to back down
ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP)  Fearing 
war could trigger a crisis in the 
region, Iraqs neighbors urged 
Saddam Hussein on Thursday to 
cooperate fully with UN arms inspec
tors. They avoided any public call for 
the Iraqi leader to step down.
The countries of this region do not 
wish to live through yet another war 
and all its devastating consequences, 
said a joint communique read by 
Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis.
We therefore solemnly call on the 
Iraqi leadership to move irreversibly 
and sincerely toward assuming their 
responsibilities in restoring peace 
and stability in the region.
Foreign ministers of the six coun
tries  Turkey, Syria, Iran, Jordan, 
Egypt, and Saudi Arabia  urged Iraq 
to demonstrate a more active 
approach in providing information 
on its weapons programs in full con
formity with UN regulations. 
However, Yakis and others said there 
was no discussion of urging Saddam 
to step down to spare his country 
from war.
The six ministers also urged Iraq to 
confirm its commitment under rele
vant United Nations Security Council 
resolutions regarding disarmament 
and to embark on the policy that will 
unambiguously inspire confidence to 
Iraqs neighbors.
It also urged Iraq to respect inter
nationally recognized boundaries, 
resolve outstanding issues with its 
neighbors and take firm steps 
toward national reconciliation that 
would preserve the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of Iraq.
Were fully determined to support 
the territorial integrity of Iraq, the 
statement said.
Although the statement was direct
ed primarily against Iraq, Irans 
Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal 
Kharazzi urged the United States 
against taking unilateral action. 
The idea of having this meeting 
here was to do our best to avoid such 
a situation that the US may resort to a 
unilateral action, Kharazzi told 
reporters. We have to stick to multi
lateralism and advise Americans to 
not resort to unilateral action.
US officials had hoped that the 
meeting would signal to Saddam that 
the best course would be for him to go 
into exile from his country. However, 
Turkish officials said discussion of 
Saddam leaving was not on the agen
da.
We only have one item on the 
agenda and that is how to help Iraq 
avoid a military strike, Egypts assis
tant foreign minister, Mahmoud 
Mubarak, said earlier Thursday.
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk alSharaa said the meetings message 
was a rejection of a military action.
The open message and the closed 
message is peace, no war.
All the countries present, except 
Jordan and Iran, were part of the 
1991 Gulf War coalition that drove 
Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Kuwait, 
which is hosting a large number of US 
troops preparing for a possible war, 
was not invited.
The conference wants to offer 
advice to Iraq, and Kuwait has no 
intention to advise a country it has no 
ties with, said Massouma alMubarak, a professor at Kuwait 
University. Although Kuwaits gov
ernment officials have expressed 
hope that the crisis be resolved peace
fully, they say that most Kuwaitis 
would be euphoric if Saddams gov
ernment collapsed.
Israel retaliates 
for three killings
HEBRON, West Bank (AP)  
Palestinian gunmen opened fire 
Thursday on three Israelis walking 
near a settlement in the West Bank, 
killing all of them, witnesses and res
cue officials said.
Hours later, Israeli helicopters fired 
at least five missiles at targets in Gaza 
City, while tanks also shelled targets, 
witnesses said. The Israeli military 
would say only that an operation was 
in progress.
It was not immediately clear what 
the targets were in the early Friday 
attack. One Palestinian was wounded 
in exchanges of fire with Israeli sol
diers during the tank incursion, hos
pital officials said. Palestinians said 
he was a civilian.
The West Bank shootings occurred 
at the Beit Haggai intersection near a 
settlement in the Hebron hills. It 
came just five days before Israelis 
vote for a new government.
The Islamic Hamas group took 
responsibility, issuing a leaflet saying 
the shooting was retaliation for 
attacks by Israeli settlers and military 
against Palestinians and their proper
ty in the city of Hebron.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who 
is running for re-election with a poli
cy of harsh military reprisals against 
Palestinians following violence, is 
favored over his dovish opponent, 
Amram Mitzna.

Sniper teen may 
face death penalty
I /*
FAIRFAX, Virginia (AP)  A grand 
jury indicted 17-year-old Lee Boyd 
Malvo on murder charges that could 
bring the death penalty for his 
alleged role in the sniper attacks that 
terrorized the Washington area.
The indictment, issued Tuesday 
and made public Wednesday, stems 
from the October 14 slaying of FBI 
analyst Linda Franklin outside a 
Home Depot.
Last week a juvenile court judge 
ruled that Malvo could be tried in 
adult court, making him eligible for 
the death penalty. Prosecutor Robert 
F. Horan Jr. had sought capital mur
der charges, but has not yet said 
whether he will ask for the death 
penalty.
Malvo and John Allen Muhammad, 
42, are accused of killing 13 people 
and wounding five in Alabama, 
Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Virginia and Washington, D.C.
They are being tried first in 
Virginia because its laws allow the 
best opportunities for the death 
penalty.
The grand jury indicted Malvo on 
capital murder charges under two 
statutes: One makes it a capital 
offense to commit serial killings; the 
other is a post-September 11 law that 
makes it a capital offense to kill some
one in order to terrorize the public. 
Malvo and Muhammad are the first 
defendants to be prosecuted under 
the new law.
Horan has said fingerprints from a 
rifle, notes to police and phone calls 
from Malvo link him to at least four of 
the sniper shootings.
Only one person testified before 
the grand jury, Detective June Boyle. 
She testified at an earlier hearing that 
she interviewed Malvo for about six 
hours in November.
Defense lawyers have said they will 
ask a judge to throw out any incrimi
nating statements made in that inter
view because he did not have a 
lawyer present and his court-appoint
ed guardian was denied access to 
him.
Three killed in coal 
mine explosion
CAMERON, West Virginia (AP)  
A methane gas explosion in a coal 
mine air shaft Wednesday killed three 
workers and injured three others who 
had to be rescued from more than 
900 feet below the surface.
The workers, who had been dig
ging the new shaft, were about 60 
feet from reaching the mine when the 
explosion occurred, officials said.
About an hour later, two sheriffs 
deputies descended 940 feet into the 
earth to retrieve the survivors after 
local emergency workers declined, 
saying they were not trained for such 
a rescue.
Nobody would get the guys out, so 
we had to jump in, Deputy Brent 
Wharry said. We just did what we do 
every day. This one is just blown out 
of proportion.
As smoke wafted from the 25-footwide hole, Wharry and Deputy Steve 
Cook climbed into a 5-foot-wide 
bucket attached to a crane that low
ered them to where the injured work
ers were.
It was a long trip down and a long 
trip back, but what happened in 
between was something you cant 
describe, Wharry said. The whole 
deal, going in there, I just dont want 
to talk about it. I just wish anybody 
would do that if it was me [down 
there].
The bodies of the three dead min
ers were removed from the northern 
West Virginia mine about 12 hours 
after the blast.
Officials identified the victims of 
the blast as David Abel, 47, and 
Richard Mount, 37, both from Ohio; 
and Harry Roush III, 23, from 
Pennsylvania.
The father of one of the injured 
men said his son, Aaron Meyer, 28, 
had been treated and released from a 
local hospital.

Feds crack down 
on fake colleges
MADISON, Wisconsin (U-WIRE) 
 Congressional investigators 
decided to test the Department of 
Educations loan program for stu
dents attending foreign colleges. 
Their mission: Create a fake uni
versity in London and obtain loans 
to attend it.
This imaginary university, 
named the YHica Institute for the 
Visual Arts by investigators, 
obtained certification allowing the 
institution to take part in the loan 
program. Three students were 
then created and eventually 
approved for several $18,500 dol
lar loans.
According to reports, officials 
from the Department of Education 
failed to second-guess the institu
tion due to credentials the universi
ty was thought to have. These qual
ities consisted of a website, a 
school president, a catalog, and 
apparent students in need of finan
cial assistance.
These Congressional investiga
tors also left an open clue behind 
the doors of this institution. Susan 
M. Collins was an enrolled stu
dent at the university in need of 
aid. However, US Senator Susan M. 
Collins, Republican-Maine, does 
exist and was the specific lawmak
er who requested the investigation.
The loan program would have 
been scammed out of a total of 
$55,000 dollars in loans had the
final transactions gone through. 
However, loan companies became 
suspicious, and the undercover 
agents stopped the investigation. 
Officials at the Education 
Departments Federal Student Aid 
Office have insisted they would have 
caught the errors before the loan 
money was awarded, because a 
lender noticed irregularities in the 
student applications and notified the 
department.
This situation is definitely shad
ed, University of Wisconsin junior 
Bobby Roshan said. I didnt receive 
any financial aid when I studied 
abroad, and any way that they could 
have provided assistance would have 
been helpful.
In hopes of correcting the program, 
the department will now make visits 
to all foreign schools that apply for 
entrance to loan programs. Students 
who choose to study abroad have the 
possible option of receiving federal 
aid in order to complete their desired 
venture to another continent.

at top universities and also make 
up a larger portion of the overall 
population of students. At Notre 
Dame, 57 percent of students 
. admitted were children of alumni, 
with 23 percent of these students 
actually enrolling at the university.
Ridding admissions policies of 
legacy preference could result in 
financial implications for many 
universities.
Alumni account for more than 
28 percent of all private donations 
given to institutions of higher edu
cation. This percentage amounted 
to an approximate $6.83 billion for 
the 2000-01 academic year.
At the University of Wisconsin, 
having alumna parents can offer a 
slight advantage in the admissions 
process, just as race does. These 
are all considered plus factors in 
the admissions office, along with 
many other factors, including 
diversity of race.
Tom Riesen, assistant director 
for admissions said that giving a 
slight advantage to children of 
graduates offers loyalty to families 
who provide support for UW.
Looking Ahead
jffc Some 4.6 million Americans 
^ will receive assistance this year 
under the Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program, White House 
spokesman Ari Fleischer said. The 
$200 million brings the programs 
total for this heating season to $1.5 
billion, he said. The additional funds, 
released by President Bush on Friday, 
will be more than necessary this year, 
according to Fleischer. He went on to 
note that the government estimates 
that residential home heating oil 
prices will be more than 20 percent 
higher than the average of the last 
five years.
In next months budget, 
^ President Bush will propose a 
new $1.75 billion, five-year program 
to aid Americans with disabilities 
transition from nursing homes or 
other institutions to living in regular 
communities. The proposal is one of 
several new efforts to be included in 
the Fiscal Year 2004 budget for the 
Presidents New Freedom Initiative, a 
nationwide effort to integrate people 
with disabilities more fully into soci
ety.
President Bush and his cabinet 
^ have threatened to veto an 
omnibus appropriations bill if it does 
not include language prohibiting the 
use of federal funds for abortions. In 
addition, in stating its Administration 
policy, the White House said the cur
rent version of the omnibus spending 
package neglected to fund several 
needy groups, while helping more 
extraneous ones, such as unsustain
able funding for highways.

Overdue clean-up 
aimed for landfill
PITTSBURGH, Penn. (AP)  It has 
come after 20 years of investigation 
and study, two trials, two overturned 
convictions, a failed temporary 
cleanup, and more than $2 million 
spent.
That site off Henderson Road is on 
the Pennsylvania Priorities List, the 
states version of the federal 
Superfund Site list.
Representatives from the 
Department of Environmental 
Protection (DEP) explained the 
cleanup plan to about 50 residents 
last week at a public meeting held by 
state Representative Dave Levdanksy, 
Democrat Forward.
He said US Steel will pay for the 
cleanup because it generated about 
63 percent of the hazardous waste 
dumped at the Fiore Landfill.
DEP Project Manager John 
Halusczcak said coal tar, a by-product 
of producing coke for steel making, is 
the major contaminant at the landfill.
Jim Shack, DEP chief of hazardous 
site cleanup, said a dozen other com
panies generated contaminants dis
posed of at the landfill, but that DEP 
had reached a consent agreement 
with US Steel last August under 
which the corporation will be 
responsible for the site forever.
It can seek reimbursement from 
the other companies, and DEP will 
forgive US Steel its share of the 
$2,095,922 DEP has spent so far. 
Shack called US Steel a good corpo
rate neighbor for coming forward.
Most of the responsible parties did 
nothing illegal; it was a permitted 
site, he said. The operator of the 
site put [hazardous waste] in the 
wrong place.
Elderly man beats 
officer on street
PITTSBURGH, Penn. (AP)  
Having chased down a man who 
allegedly ran a stop sign and then fled 
from her flashing lights and siren, 
Chatham College police officer Nicole 
Bernard said she stepped out of her 
car to cite him.
But he wouldnt listen when she 
ordered him back into his vehicle, she 
testified yesterday. She handcuffed 
one of his wrists. Hit him with pepper 
spray. Bit his arm. Smashed him with 
her baton. Poked him in the eye. 
Kneed him in the groin. Kicked him in 
the head. But none of that was 
enough to subdue Alan I.W. Frank on 
December 29, she told City Court 
Chief Magistrate William Simmons. 
Frank kept fighting with her. Locked 
in a struggle with a man 50 years her 
senior, a struggle she said he was win
ning, the 20-year-old Bernard made 
one last appeal.
He got my thumb and he bent it 
back so far. Any more tension, it 
would break. I said to him, I dont 
even care anymore. Im going to get 
my handcuff key and let you go. He 
was totally in control, Bernard said 
during a preliminary hearing for 
Frank on Tuesday in City Court.
Her testimony was enough to hold 
Frank for trial on charges of aggravat
ed assault, disorderly conduct, resist
ing arrest,fleeing, and eluding.

Parents use son 
to scam $700
BETHLEHEM, Pennsylvania 
(AP)  Parents of a 7-year-old boy 
admitted scamming neighbors of 
nearly $700 by dressing their son 
in a Cub Scouts uniform and going 
door-to-door seeking donations for 
a nonexistent pack.
Anthony M. Herman, 46, and 
Sally Ann Gombocz, 45, of 
Bethlehem knocked on more than 
150 doors between January 7 and 
January 18, collecting $667 as 
their son silently smiled, police 
said.
At the couples arraignment 
Wednesday, Herman said they per
petrated the scam because the 
family landscaping business was 
failing.
What weve done here was a 
desperation act, Herman told the 
judge. Im not trying to minimize 
what I did. It was stupid, very stu
pid.
Bethlehem police arrested the 
couple after receiving tips from 
neighbors. Both were charged with 
theft by deception, corruption of 
minors, criminal conspiracy, and 
related offenses.
The charges carry a maximum 
penalty of five years in prison and 
a $10,000 fine. No plea was 
entered and a preliminary hearing 
was set for January 31.
The boy is not a Cub Scout, 
though his parents convinced him 
he was when he put on the uni
form, police said. He remains in 
the custody of his parents, who
were released on $5,000 bail each, 
authorities said.
Thats awful ... using the child 
like that, said Sharon DeAngelis, 
who donated $5 Friday. The little 
boy had a smile on his face. He did
nt talk, though.
The couple told donors they 
were raising money for a camping 
trip for Cub Scout Pack 351, which 
does not exist, police said. Herman 
and Gombocz acknowledged 
spending the money, authorities 
said.
Officials ban pethuman massages
EAST HAMPTON, MA (AP)  
The idea of people and pets getting 
professional massages in the same 
place rubs city officials the wrong 
way, so restrictions will be tight
ened. The Board of Health is con
sidering a proposal to differentiate 
between animal and human clients 
of massage therapists.
We dont want [massage thera
pists] massaging animals at the 
same facility where humans are 
massaged, Health Agent Dennis 
Lacourse told the Daily Hampshire 
Gazette. Do physicians let you 
bring your dog into the examining 
room? No.
He said human clients in facili
ties used by animals could be 
exposed to parasites and disease.
Pets have fleas, Lacourse said. 
Fleas carry the plague.
The Board of Health will hold a 
public hearing February 3 on a 
proposal that would require thera
pists providing massage and mus
cle therapies for animals to set up 
a facility specifically for them.

Suspect eyed in 
Morewood thefts
by Irene Ojini
Photo Staff
A series of reported thefts from the 
cars parked in the Morewood parking 
lot since the beginning of the year has 
led to a joint investigation between 
CMU Police and Pittsburgh Police. 
Eight vehicles were burglarized 
between January 2 and January 12.
According to CMU Police Chief 
Creig Doyle, two witnesses have iden
tified the suspect as a white male 
with red hair and a shaggy beard. 
Both Carnegie Mellon University and 
the city police believe the thief used a 
door lock punching tool to gain 
entrance into most of the vehicles, 
but smashed the window of one.
The thief usually steals car stereos, 
CDs, cassette players, and tapes. The 
University police have taken steps to 
alert those who park in the 
Morewood parking lot garage of the 
thefts. According to Chief Doyle, each 
permit holder was sent an email to 
notify them of the crime. The police 
department also printed 700 copies 
of the crime report and put them on 
the windshield of each car in the lot.
Carnegie Mellon University police 
and the Zone six City Police officers 
have been working to monitor and 
increase security in order to ensure 
the safety of vehicles parked on or 
near the lot.
Security is doing everything they 
can to increase the safety of cars in 
the lot.... [And] hopefully with the 
increased security and watchfulness 
of those using the parking lot the 
thefts will not continue, said Kelly 
Robertson, graduate student in 
chemistry.
The thefts have forced permit hold
ers to take precautions. Damian 
Dourado, program associate for the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Project, said 
when he was notified of the thefts, he 
made sure he removed the personal
possessions in his car from plain viejlv, 
and has since been wary of his sur
roundings. He and others are unsure 
of how effective the measures will foe.
I have not noticed [the increased 
security], but it seems to me thafjf 
these people are burglarizing cars, it 
might take some more constant sur
veillance to catch them, said Angela 
Tsai, a sophomore business adminis
tration student.
Greek men shine 
in fall academics
by Anne Jolis
Assistant News Editor
On Tuesday, the Greek Council, the 
Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the 
PanHellenic Council joined forces to 
host a dinner in the Rangos Ballroom. 
The event was held to honor the 
Greek men and women who hd 
achieved a 3.5 or higher cumulative 
QPA, or a 3.5 or higher QPA by the 
end of last semester. -3
According to Dan Mastrian, "a 
senior computer science and brother 
at Sigma Phi Epsilon, it was a pleasant 
evening, with good food and a protfd 
atmosphere. The keynote speaker, 
Arthur Lubetz, is an architect who 
graduated from CMU and was "a 
brother at Pi Kappa Alpha (Pika). 'H 
continues to remain active with the 
fraternities and the University.
Another occasion worth celebrat
ing that night was that, for the first 
time on record, according to IFC pres
ident Kenton Kline, the Greek mens 
average QPA was higher than th 
independent mens average.
Kline is a junior, double-majoring 
in psychology and human-computer 
interaction (HCI). He is also a brother 
at Delta Upsilon fraternity, and says 
that he is proud of his brothers and 
the other fraternities for their acade1 
mic successes.
Not only does the Greek system 
have a dear and defined set of values 
for social functions, leadership and 
service, it shows that our academic 
pursuits are just as important as any 
others held by our community.
Womens soccer 
team loses coach
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  
Womens soccer head coach 
Roland Sturk announced his resig
nation Friday after seven seasons 
with the Panthers. Sturk, who was 
the first and only coach since the 
teams inception in 1996, cites a 
lack of progress by the program as 
the reason surrounding his deci
sion.
When I came to Pitt, I had aspi
rations of building a championship 
program, Sturk said. The pro
gram has made some progress but 
the resources and infrastructure 
are not in place.
During his tenure, Sturk com
piled a 36-87-6 record, including a 
415 mark last season. In just his 
second year at Pitt, Sturk guided 
the Panthers to the Big East 
Championship playoffs.
Prior to his time at Pitt, Sturk 
spent seven seasons as the head 
coach at Regis University, and in 
1994, he took the team to the 
NCAA Division II Womens Soccer 
Championships.
That same season, he was named 
the National Soccer Coaches 
Association of Americas Regional 
Coach of the Year.
He added that while it was not a 
spur of the moment decision, no 
one knew about his choice, and 
that the arrangement will be mutu
ally beneficial for both himself and 
those in the athletics department.
We appreciate Roland Sturks 
efforts during his time at the 
University of Pittsburgh, interim 
Athletics Director Marc Boehm said 
in a statement released Friday.
We certainly wish him well in 
his future pursuits. Our search for a 
new head coach will begin immedi
ately. With a thriving university 
and athletic department, we 
believe we will attract a strong pool 
of potential candidates.
Carnegie museum 
kills film program
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  In a 
surprising announcement January 
9, the Carnegie Museum of Art cut 
its film and video department as
part of a $4 million Carnegie systemwide budget reduction.
CMAs film and video department 
has been important to the indepen
dent cinematic landscape of 
Pittsburgh since its creation in the 
late 1960s, and instrumental in bring
ing foreign and independent films to 
the city. Now, the CMA cites the pro
liferation of other sites that offer the 
same types of films as a factor that 
played into the decision to cut the 
department.
Another reason given for the deci
sion to cut the department was a 
monetary one.
In a written statement, Richard 
Armstrong, the Henry J. Heinz II 
director of the CMA, wrote, The ago
nizing decision was prompted exclu
sively by greatly reduced endowment 
income for the foreseeable future, 
which caused the CMA, with its 
depleted resources, to protect the 
other, unique parts of our collection.
The Carnegie also cited a decline in 
the value of their investments as a 
contributing factor.
Despite the potential strain on the 
budget that the film and video 
department may have caused, many 
think its elimination will be detri
mental to the independent film com
munity in Pittsburgh and to film as an 
important art form nationally.
The National Alliance for the 
Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC), 
which held its national conference at 
the CMA in 1998  a testament to 
the film and video departments 
national reputation created under 
curator Bill Judson  has called the 
decision shocking.
To protest the decision made by the 
Carnegie, NAMAC has begun a letter 
writing campaign to show support for 
the program and for film as a cultur
ally important art form. In the state
ment requesting the letter writing 
campaign, NAMAC program director 
Daniel Schott said, Given our cur
rent economic climate, we all under
stand the financial pressure organiza
tions currently face and the unfortu
nate need for budget reductions.
This action on the part of 
Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh 
demonstrates economic shortsighted
ness and disregard for our field, 
Schott said. According to the NAMAC, 
the media arts are arguably the most 
important art form of the last centu
ry.
Other groups reacting negatively to 
CMAs decision include Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers, whose film lineup pre
dominantly includes only indepen
dent and foreign films.

the main entrance door of Marybelle 
Apartments. An officer responded, 
'and found an unknown female lying 
on her right side on the floor near the 
entrance stairs. Two people were 
shaking her shoulder trying to wake 
her. According to the officer, a strong 
odor of alcohol was emanating from 
the females body. She responded by 
moaning, and there was no identifi
cation found in her pockets. 
University Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS) was called, and 
.attended to the young woman. She 
was then provided transportation to 
the emergency room, where she was 
treated further, and a nurse found her 
CMU ID. No state citation was issued 
for underage drinking because this 
was a call for help by a student, and 
amnesty applied.
Disorderly Conduct, 1/18/03, 
1:49 am  A brother of Phi Kappa 
Theta fraternity phoned Campus 
Police to report unwanted guests on 
'their porch. Two officers responded 
to the call, along with two Fraternity 
Patrol officers. According to one offi
cer, the unwanted guests were all 
brothers of the Beta Theta Pi 
Fraternity, and were urinating on the 
Phi Kappa Theta garage and porch. 
The conflict was completely verbal 
and neither fraternity indicated that 
violence was imminent. Internal cita
tions were issued for disorderly con
duct to the offending Betas.
' Intoxication, 1/18/03, 2:24 am 
 A brother from Beta Theta Pi called 
University Police to come to the fra

cated female from the property. Two 
officers responded to the call and 
called in a car to help with transport. 
Upon arrival, an officer said that he 
inquired about the girl, and a brother 
responded in a very loud voice that 
she would be brought out by the 
lower doors. When the brothers 
brought her out, one of the officers 
took her to the car and began ques
tioning her, but stopped when shout
ing broke out between one of the 
brothers (the one who had made the 
call) and the CMU police units. The 
female later reported that she had 
been at the fraternity house since 
around 10 pm, had had three or four 
beers, and had not drank anywhere 
else that night. She was not cited 
because the amnesty applied in her 
situation.
Defiant Trespass, 1/18/03, 5:43

called to Posner Hall, where, in the 
first floor mens room, he discovered 
a male asleep on a small sofa. The 
officer recognized the male immedi
ately. After conversing briefly, it was 
unclear to both the officer and the 
actor what exactly his affiliation with 
CMU was. The male stated that as of 
last week, he still had a valid email 
account, and was pursuing his gradu
ate thesis in Electronic Media. He was 
once a student and an employee at 
the University, and did not under
stand why he was not entitled to sleep 
on a couch on campus. However, the 
officers told him that until he had 
written documentation from aIUniversity official stating that he was 
fallowed on campus, he would be con

CMU student studies abroad 
in Lebanon, plans exchange
by Anne Jolis
Assistant News Editor
Salma Zahr will leave for Beirut, 
! Lebanon tomorrow to become the 
1 first student in CMUs history to study 
\ abroad in an Arab nation.
! Zahr is a third-year Electrical and 
1 Computer Engineering student, and 
will be spending a semester at the 
American University of Beirut (AUB).
1 AUB was founded in 1866 and aims 
\ to educate Lebanese and other Arab 
students in a Western university set
ting.
According to Eva Mergner, the 
study-abroad advisor who has been 
helping Zahr plan her trip, few CMU 
students have shown interest in 
studying in Lebanon, or other Arab 
countries. Zahr, however, hopes to 
changes this.
Hopefully, when I get back, Ill be 
able to tell the students in an info ses
sion about my trip. I want to make 
sure they feel comfortable and safe 
going to an Arabic world.
Its more important now than ever 
that people lose the negative stereo
type they have about Arabs, she said.
Her ultimate goal is to coordinate a 
regular exchange program between 
AUB and CMU, but before she can 
make that happen, she will have 
many obstacles to overcome, includ
ing a pervasive sense of fear for some.
Many CMU students feel that to 
! spend the semester in such a politi. cally volatile place would be too great 
| a safety risk.
; I probably wouldnt go, just 
because I wouldnt be comfortable,
 but Im sure she knows the risks and if 
! shes aware of them, then its her 
I decision, said Elizabeth MacWillie, a 
sophomore architecture student.
I wouldnt go. Its not the time or 
place. She should find a country 
more similar to this one. One less 
dangerous. Its just not the best place 
for an American right now, said Taj 
Corinaldi, a first-year Japanese 
major.
The concern of her peers is not the 
only obstacle Zahr has faced in 
preparing for her trip and planning
the exchange program.
She also fears that if relations 
between the US and the Middle East 
become too strained, she may lose 
both the time and the opportunity to 
receive academic credit for her trip.
I worry that the President might 
ask all non-essential US citizens to 
leave specific countries within the 
Middle East, which could possibly 
cost me a semesters worth of cred
its, she said.
To prepare for that possibility, AUB 
has formed a joint agreement with 
the American Embassy to cover the 
costs of sending US students back to 
their homes if necessary, and to fly 
them back to Beirut when they are 
allowed to finish their studies.
Though Zahr is very aware of the 
risks involved, and knows the current 
political climate is tenuous, she 
remains excited about her trip, and 
has not let her worry faze her.
I am not nervous or scared at all. I 
know that the University and the 
Arabs there will be very welcoming 
and hospitable, she said.
However, not everyone is as confi
dent as Zahr.
I have some qualms about her 
safety, because of the conflicts in the 
area. But I do think she knows what 
shes getting into, said Mergner.
Mergner has made Zahr agree to 
keep in close contact with CMU and 
the Study Abroad office, saying that it 
is always important to check up with 
students in foreign countries, and 
that, in Zahrs case, the University 
will be even more vigilant in staying 
abreast of her well-being.
Zahrs parents, who are Lebanese 
and studied at AUB themselves, share 
some of Mergners concerns.
At first, my parents were unwilling 
to even recognize the idea that I 
wanted to study abroad in Lebanon, 
but after a little research and speak
ing to some of their friends in 
Lebanon they realized that AUB is, in 
many ways, just as safe as CMU.
Now they have become very open 
to the idea and have already planned 
to visit me during Easter.

tries in the Middle East, including
La prima re-opened after 
food safety issues resolved

Salma Zahr is preparing to study abroad in Lebanon. She leaves today for a 
semester at the American University of Beirut. Zahr will the first student in 
CMUs history to study abroad in an Arab nation. She hopes to start an exchange 
program between CMU and AUB when she returns.
Jordan, Egypt, and Israel, is sure 
that once she returns from her trip 
and shares her stories, more stu
dents will feel safe and even excited 
to visit Arab nations.
Americans hold an image that 
the Arab world in unsafe for 
Americans and that Arabs hate 
them, she said.
Nothing could be farther from 
the truth. There is disenchantment 
with American foreign policies, but 
not with Americans as people.
Thats exactly the sort of dia
logue we need right now  some
one to go over there and tell the real 
story, said Ghadi Shayban, a sopho
more piano major.
He went on to say that the only 
impression that Americans get of the 
Middle East is through the media, 
which, he notes, can be extremely 
biased.
Though she has her work cut out 
for her in her quest to entice her fel
low students to the Arab nations, 
some students are not as apprehen
sive.
You cant let fear stop you from 
learning and embracing other cul
tures. If you replace understanding 
with fear, youll never get anywhere, 
said Sean Crandon, a sophomore CS 
and dance major.

however, have not changed signifi
cantly in many years.
The acceptance rates go to the 
heart of our affirmative action pro
gram, said Cohon. It is about creat
ing a student body strong in both aca
demics and character.
The President said Carnegie 
Mellons affirmative action program 
derives from the legal work of former 
Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. 
With the 1978 Bakke Decision, 
Powell ruled that a universitys inten
tion of creating a diverse student 
body was compelling enough to allow 
race to be one of many factors used in 
admission.
According to Cohon, diversity cant 
be represented byminorities, but 
depends on broadening the applica
tion base.
To do this, Carnegie Mellon has
made a concerted effort to recruit 
minorities from inner-city areas 
across New England, south Florida 
and California.
But Carnegie Mellon does not have 
a specific goal or objective to quanti
fy diversity.
According to Elliott, the University 
doesnt have a target percentage of 
the student body it tries to fill with 
underrepresented minorities or 
women.
However, this is likely because the 
Bakke Decision outlawed the use of 
quotas or set-asides.
In defining a target percentage, a 
University would, in essence, create a 
quota.
Cohon did acknowledge that some 
minority students were admitted 
who had GPAs and SAT scores lower 
than some applicants who were 
rejected.
Both Cohon and Elliott stressed 
that in the admissions process, race is 
simply viewed as another non-acade
mic factor, much like leadership 
experience, athletic ability, and 
extracurricular activities.
We try to find reasons to admit 
students, not reject them, said 
Elliott. We look at many other fac
tors before race.
He also said the University doesnt 
admit anyone based solely on ethnic 
background, and that all students 
admitted ?re qualified to attend.

group of Hispanic women who 
oppose the war.
The march was only one part 
of a weekend-long effort to raise 
awareness about opposition to 
the war.
On Friday, a teach-in was 
held at the Pitt Student Union. 
Various organizations were there 
to educate people about the costs 
of war.
I think that too many people 
watch the evening news and 
think theyre being fully 
informed, said Julie Smith, a 
junior Pitt student who was there 
volunteering her time. In order 
to build a movement against the 
war, people need to be educat
ed.
Ken Boas, an English professor 
at Pitt, led a discussion on the 
effects a war would have on the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. 
About fifty people, both young 
and old, circled around him to 
take part in an open discussion 
about the issue. Boas, a member 
of Professors for Peace and 
Justice, said the group wants to 
provide a place for discussions to 
occur.
I think we can serve as sup
port, a model, and as fellow par
ticipants, he said. We want to 
be a part of it. We still believe in 
it.
On Saturday some of the activ
ities included legal and medical 
training. Street medics, people 
who attend protests to medically 
assist anyone who may need 
help, lectured on how to treat 
wounds from chemical weapons, 
such as pepper spray. They also 
covered how to avoid hypother
mia and how to manage the psy
chological aftermath of a protest.
We tell you these things to 
prepare you, not to give you a 
sense of doom, said one of the 
street medics, who goes by the 
name of Tony. According to one 
of the medics, who preferred 
only to be called Echo, no one 
was seriously injured during the 
protest, though many were cold 
in the twenty degree weather.
Meredith Lanros, a 19-year-old 
community college student, laid

La Prima in Wean Hall reopened on 
Wednesday after being closed for 
almost a week due to health viola
tions issued by the Allegheny County 
Health Department. These violations 
included obtaining water from an 
unsanitary source (a nearby mop 
sink), an open container of toilet 
cleaner near the water source, and 
improper cold handling.
After a thorough re-inspection on 
Tuesday, we found that La Prima had 
been brought up to code, said Dave 
Zazac, spokesman for the Allegheny 
County Health Department.
The consumer alert sign was 
brought down and all is clear to 
resume normal operations.
Jane Fahringer, Parkhurst manag
er, said La Prima had a similar issue 
with their water source two years 
ago. They used bottled water and 
another source for water. It became 
difficult for them to haul the water 
from the source that they were using 
so somewhere in between they 
stopped doing that, said Fahringer.
La Prima is now using an alternate 
sink to obtain water for food prepara
tion. Plans to move La Prima to a
more accommodating location are 
under consideration.
To keep dining facilities up to par, 
regular spot checks by Parkhurst 
management will be performed twice 
a week at random. Fahringer will 
monitor La Prima and other 
Parkhurst vendors on campus to 
ensure sanitary conditions and prop
er food handling.
Forty-three people attended 
Wednesdays dining town meeting in 
Rangos Hall in the University Center 
to discuss dining issues with universi
ty and Parkhurst officials. Mention of 
the La Prima incident by officials was 
conspicuously all but absent, but stu
dents voiced concerns about rectify
ing health violations as well as main
taining quality control.
I care about the damage that 
could happen when I eat something 
thats undercooked or gone bad, said 
Kirstin Oswald, a first year in CIT. 
Its disgusting and things have to be 
handled a lot better.
Michael Murphy, dean of student 
affairs, said that dining services will 
be striving to regain credibility and to 
become more responsive to crisis.

Nicholas F. Camody, executive vice president and chief operating officer for 
Parkhurst Dining Services, takes notes as students fire off constructive criticism.
Student soldiers prepare
ROTC, from page A1
The atmosphere is a little more 
serious because the seniors are get
ting ready to graduate and be com
missioned, and they could go into 
combat, said Gerle. [The threat of 
war] is just kind of there, lurking in 
the background.
George Davenport, a senior chemi
cal engineering major who has been 
in naval ROTC for four years, will be 
in Washington, D.C. this summer 
working with naval reactors.
Obviously theres a little anticipa
tion because of current events, but I 
dont think anyones scared of it? said 
Davenport. Its what were trained to 
do.
Nick Fleming, a senior biology 
major who has also been in naval 
ROTC for four years, said its easy for 
some senior midshipmen to overlook 
what a war with Iraq could mean for 
them, since theyre still in school. It 
does, however, get them thinking a
lot more about what theyre doing, 
said Fleming.
Peter Hackett, command officer of 
the naval Marine Corps reserve cen
ter in Pittsburgh, said reserves are 
required to serve two weeks of active 
duty per year, unless there is a presi
dential recall, in which case they can 
be called to fight (Reserves were 
called in in 1990 for the war with 
Iraq). There are currently 471 
reserves in the Pittsburgh area. No 
CMU students are enlisted, but some 
students from the University of 
Pittsburgh and Penn State are, and 
could be pulled out of school if called 
upon.
Students in the ROTC program 
understand they may have to serve in 
a war, said Gerle. Nobody goes into 
military service without knowing 
thats a possibility.
According to Boyd, not many stu
dents look forward to fighting in a 
war. At the same time, he said, if 
called upon, they will serve.
Challenge all but ignored

raise that she decided to pledge it in 
its entirety. Some students feel simi
larly.
I really think it would be sad if he 
just said no, said Shauna Mclnnes, 
an undeclared sophomore at Pitt.
Shauna doesnt know if the chal
lenge will work but thinks that how 
this turns out will show how much 
those in power care about making the 
university a better place.
The January 24 issue of The Pitt 
News published three articles that 
called into doubt the challenges 
momentum.
University administrator Albert 
Novaks column spoke out in strong 
defense of the chancellor and empha
sized his long record of philanthropy 
with the University. According to 
Novak, the chancellor was instru
mental in a University fund-raising 
drive which met its goal of $500 mil
lion more than a year early, the 
largest amount of money ever raised 
in this region by any institution for 
any purpose.
Over $100,000 of that money was 
donated out of the chancellors own 
pocket.
The article also cites the chancel
lors more recent generosity. 
According to Novak, even before his
raise was announced, the chancellor 
had been planning to donate $50,000 
to the University, an offer he formal
ized last week and one that more 
than meets the 14 percent challenge.
But according to Hartman, 
Nordenbergs donation doesnt quali
fy as meeting The Chancellor 
Challenge. The challenge specifical
ly called for a donation to the 
Endowed Book Fund. If Nordenberg 
had accepted the challenge, his raise 
and the pledged money would be 
donated to the Endowed Book Fund, 
a fund that helps students who cant 
afford textbooks.
Jeffery Alex, former student body 
president, also criticized the chal
lenge. In his letter to the editor, Alex 
claimed that the challenge has 
turned into an attack on an individ
ual. He called on the people pledged 
to recognize the good the chancellor 
has done and asks them to follow 
through with their donations regard
less of what the chancellor chooses to 
do.
Hartmans January 24 Pitt News 
column dealt with Pitt officially 
ignoring the challenge. He requests 
feedback about whether to continue 
pressing the issue. Neither 
Chancellor Nordenberg nor 
Executive Director of Public Affairs 
Hill could be reached for comment.

Bob Maddock (left) and Frank Smith (right) were present to help Vincent Eirene with his annual anti-war protest in front of 
Warner Hall. The group protested both CMUs military defense research and the fact that Carnegie Mellon University takes 
only half the day off on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
Protestors annual MLK Day vigil 
ignored, students a bit skeptical
by Nick Ennis
Staffwriter
V
Braving a cold and windy day, 
Vincent Eirene staged his annual 
c protest in front of Warner Hall on 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day. For the 
past 15 years, he has called for 
Carnegie Mellon to end its robotics 
research for the Department of 
Defense and to cancel all classes on 
MLK Jr. Day.
As Kings speech Beyond 
Vietnam played, a group of nine 
protestors handed out literature to 
passersby, wielding a sign that read, 
_l Disarm CMU.
The literature dealt with various 
^ issues, including the lack of African2 American students at Carnegie 
Mellon as well as staff pay and 
defense funding.
According to Eirene, the research 
done at Carnegie Mellon supports 
unnecessary war and should not be 
part of the Universitys agenda.
He said his protest is on Martin
Luther King Day because, in his opin
ion, Carnegie Mellon is no place to 
learn Kings ideals.
Carnegie Mellon should be caring 
for cities, researching a cure for AIDS 
and helping the environment, not 
developing weapons, said Eirene.
The US Department of Defense 
has contracted Carnegie Mellon to 
research software systems for 
decades.
In fact, 40 percent of the 
Universitys research budget comes 
from the Department of Defense.
The University officially denies 
that these contracts are used directly 
to develop weapons.
In a previous interview with The 
Tartan, President Cohon said, Its 
arguable whether well actually be 
building a tank. We dont know how 
to build tanks  we dont build 
weapons systems. But what we do 
very well is develop technologies 
that will be part of such a vehicle or 
weapon.
The protest, which lasted for less 
than an hour, went largely unnoticed
by students.
According to Carnegie Mellon 
Police Sergeant William Ricci, 
Eirenes protest occurs each year 
without incident.
He and two fellow Campus Police 
officers watched the protest from 
the warmth of Warner Hall to pro
tect Eirenes first amendment right 
to protest.
Students who walked by the 
protest showed little interest in the 
gathering, and most did not read the 
literature. Many students were skep
tical of the protests meaning and its 
connection with Martin Luther King 
Jr.
Its kind of funny, I think, but Im 
not sure how many arms CMU has, 
said first-year engineering student 
Justin Marini.
I think the protest is lame, and 
the turnout is typical of Carnegie 
Mellon students, said Laura 
Sperduto, sophomore civil engineer.
Eirene said that though turnout 
was much smaller than he expected, 
he is never disappointed.
You will be blamed for anything in your 
suitcase, no matter who puts it there. 
Ignorance is no excuse, if its in your suitcase, 
its your crime, and you will do the time.

Tooth-whitening technology has 
been around for some time, but the 
over-the-counter at-home system 
known as Crest Whitestrips have 
recently made the process more 
convenient and affordable.
Traditional professional toothwhitening systems use relatively 
high-concentration (roughly 35 
percent) hydrogen peroxide 
solutions to oxidize tooth stains 
over the course of an hour. 
Sometimes a laser is also used to 
help speed up the reaction. Crest 
Whitestrips use a 6 percent 
hydrogen peroxide concentra
tion to achieve the same effect 
over two weeks worth of hourly 
sessions.
Its essentially the same chem
ical process by which sodium 
hypochlorite (a.k.a. bleach) 
breaks down stains on your 
clothing. The hydrogen peroxide 
breaks apart chemical com
pounds known as chromophores 
that give stains their color. Other 
chemicals in the Whitestrips help 
oxidize stains beneath the sur
face, supposedly allowing the 
product to achieve the same 
results as expensive professional 
tooth-whitening systems.
While professional toothwhitening systems generally 
require that the dentist take 
impressions of the patients 
mouth, from which custom 
mouth trays are made to fit the
John Kim/Art Staff
patients teeth and hold the 
whitening solution, Crest
Whitestrips use a different 
approach. The strips contain a 
high-tech acrylic polymer thick
ener called Carbopol 956 which 
swells into a gelatinous film in 
the presence of moisture. When 
you put the strips in your mouth 
the gel conforms to the profile of 
your teeth, eliminating the need 
for custom-molded mouth trays. 
The patented Carbopol polymer, 
and others like it, come from 
Noveon Inc., formerly the 
Performance Materials division 
of the B. F. Goodrich Company. 
So you might be surprised to 
know that you have a bit of tire 
technology sitting in your 
mouth. The strip itself is made of 
polyethylene.
Most of the other chemicals 
are present only in very, very 
small quantities  otherwise' 
you might not be so pleased with 
the results of your tooth-whiten
ing experience!
Ingredients include purified 
water, glycerin, sodium hydrox
ide (a.k.a. lye, one of the two 
compounds that form bleach), 
sodium acid pyrophosphate, 
sodium stannate, and sodium 
saccharin. Sodium hydroxide can 
react violently with water, and 
various other compounds, 
including the Carbopol 956 
thats in the Whitestrips. Coming

Porn finds its way 
onto cell phones
Imagine: Youre sitting in the movie 
theater, cuddled up next to your 
boyfriend or girlfriend, enjoying the 
picture, when all of a sudden, the 
shrill ring of a cell phone echoes 
through the room.
Soon, you may instead hear the 
telltale panting and moaning of sex. 
New cellular technology coming on to 
the market will be able to provide 
adult erotic services right on your 
cell phone.
With the new video options avail
able in the latest generation of 
phones, it was only a matter of time 
before streaming video of hot lesbo 
action was available right at your 
fingertips.
This technology was developed in 
the Netherlands and is beginning to 
spread through Europe, with many 
companies focused on erotic enter
tainment jumping on the bandwag

Stem cells form 
new brain tissue
Recent autopsies of bone marrow 
recipients have shown that stem cells 
transplanted alongside the marrow 
have shown up in the brain as new 
patches of neurons.
These observations of brain growth 
strengthen the case for stem cell 
research, displaying stem cells ability 
to grow into any kind of tissue.
It is also speculated that some of 
the stem cells from bone marrow 
transplants have helped to recon
struct the liver and the heart of a 
patient.
The recipients of these transplants, 
all women, received their marrow 
from male donors. While the vast 
majority of the stem cells in the trans
plant go towards the building of new 
marrow and blood cells, some 
migrated up into the brain region. 
This was proven by testing these new 
patches of cells and subsequently 
finding a Y chromosome, the distin
guishing factor between males and 
females on the genetic level.
Doctors concluded that these new 
cells were formed from the cells of 
the donors. Out of every 10,000 neu
rons in the brain of the transplant 
recipient, at most only seven new 
neurons were found, but many doc
tors feel that if the recipient had lived 
longer, more cells would have been 
created.

Smallpox vaccine 
partly refused
Many hospitals across the country 
are paying little heed to the presi
dents initiative to vaccinate hospital 
personnel against smallpox in the 
coming months. 
At the Medical College of Virginia 
Hospitals, doctors feel the vaccine is 
unnecessary, and more importantly, 
dangerous. It is estimated that 50 out 
of every one million recipients of the 
vaccine will contract the disease or 
suffer from severe complications. 
Many find this unacceptable, and on 
top of that, the vaccinia virus used in 
the vaccine is especially harmful to 
those with lowered immune capabili
ties, including those with AIDS, can
cer, or transplants. Medical profes
sionals feel that this is putting many 
patients at risk when other measures 
could be taken to prevent the spread 
of the disease.
Another factor in the immuniza
tion conflict is that there have been 
no reported cases of smallpox in the 
world since 1977 and none in the US 
since 1949.
Although President Bush feels that 
a proactive stance on the situation is 
critical, some doctors feel that due to 
the fact that there have been no out
breaks to date, the decision is far too 
rash and carries too many conse
quences.
The only chance an outbreak could 
occur is if another terrorist attack is 
the source, much like the anthrax 
scare.
The only remaining samples of the 
virus are housed in Russia and at the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in Atlanta.
However, many speculate that Iraq 
and North Korea have stockpiles and 
no one knows if and when those 
might appear on the world stage. 
Although many are cautious about 
another attack, doctors recommend 
not to worry about a smallpox epi
demic, and at this point not to worry 
about vaccinating yourself.

Sonic Flashlight peels away skin
by James Auwaerter
Copy Staff
Doctors are one step closer to hav
ing X-ray vision. The Sonic Flashlight, 
developed by George Stetten of 
Carnegie Mellons Robotics Institute 
and the University of Pittsburghs 
Bioengineering Department, allows a 
surgeon to see below the surface of 
the skin. The ultrasound technology 
used in the device has been around 
for some time and most people are 
familiar with ultrasound images of 
pre-natal babies. However, the new 
display is both more portable and 
intuitive than its predecessors. It pro
jects a picture of the subdermal tissue 
onto the skin, allowing the physician 
or nurse to look inside the patient 
during the surgery, rather than at a 
screen. This projection is actually an 
image from under the skin, viewable 
from any angle. The direct relation
ship allows natural stereoscopic intu
ition in placing surgical implements. 
One of the primary goals of the 
design is ease of use.
Specific uses for the Sonic 
Flashlight may be to aid. nurses in 
placing needles in veins and to help 
eye surgeons. Using a device like the 
Sonic Flashlight could help prevent 
clots from forming when placing an 
IV. Currently, machines like CT scan
ners or MRIs are very large, and 
expensive enough that a hospital 
cannot use them in every case where 
the information they provide would 
be helpful.
The Flashlight works by scanning a 
slice of the body with ultrasound, 
then transducing that image into a 
signal that is projected onto a half-sil
vered glass plate.
Earlier prototypes of the Sonic 
Flashlight were not as easy to manip
ulate. An original floor-standing 
device first became smaller in a pistol-grip device, which changed 
again so that it could be controlled by 
fine muscle like those in the hand, 
rather than the arm. The devices 
shape is still being evaluated based 
on user feedback. So far, the output

Mine-mapping robots 
get down and dirty
by Sue Yi Chew
Junior Staffwriter
Two Sundays ago Ferret, a minemapping robot from CMU, was in 
Kansas City to investigate the effects 
of the recent collapse of the ceiling of 
a limestone mine. This collapse had 
created a dangerous dome-like sub
terranean void beneath a busy resi
dential road. Lowered into the void 
through a drilled borehole, Ferret 
was able to obtain accurate measure
ments for the creation of amazingly 
detailed 3D maps of the dome, a haz
ardous task for a team of humans.
Ferret is only one of the robots to 
come out of the robotic mine map
ping research at CMU. Using robot 
technology for profiling and map
ping is currently an area of very 
active research and is spearheaded 
by William Red Whittaker, the 
Fredkin Professor of Robotics at the 
Robotics Institute. Concern for safety 
of miners and a wish to prevent 
future accidents played a large role 
in its initiation. Most notably the dis
aster at the Quecreek mine last July 
drove CMU mine-mapping research, 
when nine men were trapped with
out food for three days in a flooded 
cavern. The accident at Quecreek is
said to have been caused by inaccu
rate maps  the miners accidentally 
drilled into a neighboring aban
doned mine which the maps showed 
to be more than 300 feet away.
The technology can be expanded 
beyond mapping applications.
We began using robots to map 
mines because there was an obvious 
need, says Whittaker. But we dis
covered underground spaces beyond 
mines like caves and sewers and 
bunkers, and many purposes other 
than mapping. He mentioned min
ing, cleaning and inspection as fair 
game. He continued, [Robots] can 
go to places people cannot go, such 
as abandoned mines, small port
holes, coal seams that have low ceil
ing height.
Meet the robots
Ferret is cylindrical, about a meter 
high, and is equipped with instru
ments at its head that make for high
ly accurate measurements. These 
include a long-range low reflectivity 
laser, pan and tilt unit, inclination 
sensors, and proximity sensor. It is 
designed to be lowered down a bore
hole until its sensors detect a breach, 
at which point it stabilizes itself 
against the wall and orients into an

appropriate position to take images 
of the hemisphere of the void below.
Another robot, the Groundhog, 
was designed to work in conditions 
as found in the Quecreek mine, 
which was wet and muddy and has 
an entrance about 4' high by 6' wide. 
Its chassis sports 4 wheel drive and 
steering. It is operated through wire
less Ethernet over short distances 
and a wire tether when far away. Its 
front features two lasers that pan 
horizontally and vertically respec
tively, which together provide mea
surements that can be reconstructed 
into a large 3D map in VRML format. 
Combustible gases such as methane 
are not uncommon in mines, espe
cially abandoned mines; hence 
Groundhog has two gas sensors on
the alert. If combustible gases are 
detected it will automatically power 
down its electronics to prevent the 
possibility of an explosion. Other 
explosion precautions include using 
hydraulics instead of electronics 
where possible, and encasing the 
electronics to prevent an explosion 
from affecting the mine.
Groundhog conducted the first 
ever mapping of an abandoned mine 
last October at the Florence Mine in 
Burgettstown, Pennsylvania.
Autonomous mapping
Current research challenges are 
divided into two major areas. 
Researchers study locomotion, the 
best way to travel in mines, and robot
autonomy, how a robot independent
ly senses, thinks, and. acts. The 
results may be implemented on a 
robot still on the drawing board, 
code-named Magellan. Magellan will 
be deployable through a borehole 
like Ferret, with wheels that inflate 
once inside the mine. Magellan will 
also be likely to have semi-autonomy, 
be rugged and waterproof, and have 
the ability to drive on land and 
water.
Many of the people involved in this 
research are students in a course 
called Advanced Mobile Robot 
Development  Subterranean 
Robotics, which is taught by 
Whittaker and Scott Thayer, Systems 
Scientist at the Field Robotics 
Institute.

man with a white beard, sat on the 
table with his hands folded in his 
lap, looking understandably ner

head, secured by four nail-like pins.

IN THE C.i,A. NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS
Gamma knife procedure broadcasted
GAMMA, from page A6
The purpose of that ring, or stereo
tactic frame, is to immobilize the 
head and to precisely direct the 
dosages of cobalt-60 radiation. 
Placing the pins is the biggest source 
of discomfort in the entire procedure. 
Four shots of lidocaine are given to 
the head before the ring is fitted. 
According to one of the doctors per
forming the radiosurgery, the process 
is like going to the dentist. I person
ally hate going to the dentist, but.... 
That but suggests the minor dis
comfort of the head ring is a small 
price to pay for all the convenience 
that Gamma Knife offers over tradi
tional invasive neurosurgery.
After the ring is in place, doctors
take an MRI scan to determine exact
ly where the radiation will go. Then 
the patient, who is being treated 
today for cancer that began in his kid
neys but has now spread to his brain, 
lies down and doctors fit his head 
frame into another ring. The nurse 
says, Im gonna get you a nice warm 
blanket, gonna get you nice and com
fortable in here. The man murmurs, 
Two warm blankets, making the 
nurse laugh.
When all the fitting and lastminute checks have been done, the 
table slides so that the man's head is 
in the Gamma Knife. The length of 
each treatment session is ten to forty 
minutes. Stereotactic radiosurgery is 
an outpatient procedure, and most 
patients leave the hospital within 24
hours.
A complication arising in about 
two percent of Gamma Knife cases is 
radiation necrosis, where the tumor 
dies but does not disappear fast 
enough. Radiation necrosis can be 
treated with steroids, although it 
does rarely require surgeons to man
ually, open the skull and remove the 
dead tissue. Since there is no incision 
in Gamma Knife SRS, the risk of com
plications related to general anesthe
sia, fluid leakage, hemorrhage, or 
infection is nil.
Another major advantage of 
Gamma Knife over traditional surgi
cal techniques is that it can be used to 
treat lesions deep within the brain or 
in patients that would otherwise not 
be able to tolerate such surgery.
How Things Work: Teeth-whitening

intended use (Carbopol 956, for 
example, was fed to dogs as 5 per

human products), some dentists 
have concerns about the long-term

Common temporary side effects 
of these processes can include 
tooth sensitivity to hot and cold

There have also been reports of 
sore throats, tooth pain, tingling, 
and headaches, but the American 
Dental Association says that hydro

tems are perfectly safe, and free

Other at-home tooth-whitening 
systems may not be so safe, though.
One such system involves rinsing 
your mouth with a highly acidic

your teeth with a toothpaste con

compound sounds familiar, thats 
probably because its the active 
ingredient in white paint.
However, Crest Whitestrips use a

for years, and should provide 
worry-free whiteness for properly 
maintained teeth for several years

Letter to the Editor
THE TARTAN27 January 2003
Pitt chancellor should come out 
of his shell and address issues
potential donors were uninspired by 
Pitts tarnished image.
Today, the school is a nationally 
respected institution whose endowment 
tops $1 billion.
But student leaders have complained 
that the reclusive Nordenberg has 
refused to address their concerns about 
racial profiling in the police depart
ment, meager wages for food service 
employees, and a student body that is 
disillusioned by annual double-digit 
tuition hikes.
The universitys student newspaper 
has also been snubbed by Nordenberg, 
who grants the Pitt News only one inter
view per year. Even the chancellor's 
$50,000 appeasement was announced 
by the schools institutional giving 
office, not Nordenberg himself.
Naturally, Nordenberg will not be 
liked by everyone in the university. 
However, to be an effective leader, he 
must have the conviction to do the right 
thing, even if it may be politically 
unpopular. On Tuesday, Pitt filed an 
injunction that seeks to dismiss the 1996 
same-sex benefits lawsuit. In the face of 
continued outcry against the schools 
culturally backward stance that denies 
health benefits to same-sex partners, 
Nordenberg has pulled his head back 
into his shell. This summer, when stu
dents were conveniently absent from the 
Oakland campus, Nordenberg found an 
ally on same-sex benefits. His blue-ribbon committee concluded that funding 
same-sex benefits, estimated to cost the 
school an additional $1 million a year, 
would beget negative repercussions in 
Harrisburg from conservative legisla
tors.
There is an adage that says there is no 
such thing as bad publicity  as long as 
your name is spelled correctly. But bad 
publicity and bad leadership? There 
won't be an adage for that, provided 
Pitt's basketball team plays deep into 
March Madness.
Pitt is it.
Their football team finished an 
impressive 9-4. The basketball team is 
ranked second in the country. And the 
school's malcontents had been effective
ly quieted by positive news until the 
Chancellor's Challenge.
Three weeks ago, Dave Hartman, edi
tor of the Pitt News, offered to donate 14 
percent of his yearly $8,000 stipend if 
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg would 
give back his 14 percent newly minted 
raise to their school.
Instead of just documenting dissention at the University of Pittsburgh, 
the newspaper's "Chancellor Challenge" 
placed Nordenberg in a familiar, com
promising position, but with the nega
tive publicity that usually only accompa
nies a losing record for the football 
team.
In December, the schools Board of 
Trustees approved new compensation 
packages for Nordenberg and his top 
lieutenants.
Five officers will receive raises 
between 5.4 and 10.8 percent. 
Nordenberg will receive a 14 percent pay 
raise and a $75,000 bonus for each year 
he stays at Pitt, bringing his total pay in
2003 to $465,000. Interestingly, 14 per
cent is also the amount the Board raised 
tuition by in the fall.
Nordenberg ended the maelstrom 
Friday when the University announced 
in a letter published in the Pitt News that 
he was donating $50,000 to an 
unnamed scholarship fund. But the 
Chancellors Challenge was just another 
example of public relations problems 
that have characterized Nordenbergs 
tenure.
Most students, faculty, and staffliave 
expressed admiration at the turnaround 
job orchestrated by Nordenberg. When 
his predecessor J. Dennis OConnor 
resigned in 1995, Pitt had just post
poned a much-needed fundraising cam
paign after consultants warned that

Last week was an opportunity for contem
plation about racial status and politics in the 
US as we commemorated the legacy of 
Martin Luther King Jr. Even President Bush, 
fresh off his plea to abandon affirmative 
action, acknowledged that we still have not 
reached Kings dream of racial equality. 
Nevertheless, the times have certainly 
changed. Rev. Al Sharpton formally 
announced last Tuesday that he is seeking 
the Democratic nomination for president, 
and it wasnt even a shocking revelation.
The possibility of having a black president 
is as mainstream as a Morgan Freeman 
movie. Jesse Jackson launched two notable 
bids for the Democratic nomination in the 
1980s, bringing hordes of previously unreg
istered black voters to the Democratic Party. 
More recently, Alan Keyes was one of the 
final three candidates for the Republican 
nomination in 2000.
Even ultraconservative Reform Party can
didate Pat Buchanan had a black running 
mate in that same year, despite questionable 
motives. Former Illinois Senator Carol 
Moseley Braun is still considering joining 
the 2004 presidential race, meaning that 
Sharpton might not even be the only black 
candidate. While the notion of having a 
black president is not necessarily accepted, 
as demonstrated by the lack of success for 
all of these candidates, it is on the radar 
screen.
Sharpton prides himself on being the only 
Democratic candidate consistently opposed 
to war, the death penalty, and tax cuts, 
while his major platforms include racial pro
filing and the minimum wage. Even if 
Sharpton, a definite underdog, has no 
chance of gaining the Democratic nomina
tion, his efforts will be influential. His pres
ence and outspoken nature will confront the
Bum Lee/Art ^ditor
pack. When running for Vice President on Al 
Gores ticket in 2000, Liebermans Judaism 
made him a media darling o many Jews 
were excited to have a Jewish candidate 
nearing the White House. More liberal Jews, 
though, saw past Liebermans religion and 
realized his centrist, if not conservative, 
agenda.
While many ethnic groups would love to 
see one of their own as an unprecedented 
president, there must be more criteria for 
supporting a candidate. Indeed, many Jews 
wished the late Minnesota Senator Paul 
Wellstone in Liebermans place. Lieberman 
has a legitimate shot at receiving the 
Democrat nomination in 2004, but his reli
gion will not help him gain coverage and 
votes as much as it did last time around.
We have not yet attained optimal desegre
gation and equality in this country, and 
other minorities that compose America are 
still absent from the peak of politics.
However, if Sharpton and Lieberman can 
be dismissed because of their characters and 
agendas, then we are making commendable 
progress. It is time, and long overdue, not to 
judge candidates by their skin colorprtheir 
religion.
other candidates with issues theyd prefer to 
ignore.
The Democratic Party has found much of 
its recent success in centrist ideology. 
Consequently, many frustrated liberals have 
abandoned the party in favor of Ralph 
Nader and the Green Party.
By addressing issues such as world peace 
and the economy, Sharpton does stand a 
chance to bring back liberals who have fled 
from the Democrats.
Over three million people voted for 
[Nader], Sharpton was quoted as saying in 
Newsday. And if some of them had come 
back we might have had a different result in 
the last election.
With an increased Democratic foundation 
of liberals, Sharpton could have a powerful 
backing. However, he probably will never 
reach the stage in which he would compete 
against other parties candidates. Even if he 
does, he is unlikely to recapture a substan
tial number of Green voters, although he is a 
decent mouthpiece for frustrated liberals.
The historical role of third parties, like the 
Greens, is to challenge the mainstream par
ties, forcing them to address and adopt 
neglected issues. If Sharpton can bring alter
native agendas to the forefront by reaching 
out to Green supporters, he will have 
accomplished much for the left wing.
While Sharpton does still stand out mini

University does not need to atone for diversity
dently places 67 percent more importance 
on enrolling a minority student than some
one with a 1600 SAT: a minority (African 
American or Hispanic) is awarded 20 points, 
while someone with perfect SATs only gets 
12. If race-based admissions was fair, neu
tral, and embodied the racial equality envi
sioned by Martin Luther King, we would not 
be having this discussion.
But life is not fair and there is usually rea
son behind it. So what is the reason for this 
vast, institutionalized tilt of the playing 
field? Atonement for the past injustices of 
slavery is falling out of favor because of its 
divisive nature and difficulty in implement
ing it; Cohon did not mention it. Thus, 
diversity is offered as the overriding jus
tification for this inequality. Cohon said that 
CMU needs affirmative action to achieve 
diversity. This already implies that CMUs 
admissions policy is not fair because an 
equal, race-neutral policy evidently would 
not produce adequate diversity. He placed 
great importance on this oblique idea of 
diversity and, in a delicately worded 
statement, explained its supposed impor
tance. His speech proved academias firm
belief that diversity, (which Cohon never 
actually defined) is worth the price of unfair 
admissions policies.
The problem is that glaring inconsisten
cies plague the D word in the context of 
college admissions. The only thing everyone 
seems to agree on is that diversity is good. 
I agree that exposure to diverse people and 
views are beneficial, though I do not think 
that it is indispensable to a CMU education 
as Cohon suggests. Somehow Japanese Uni
versities, in one of the worlds most homogenous societies, do a great job of educating a 
very uniform student body.
The first shortcoming of the search for 
diversity involves the criteria by which it is 
measured. Currently a university is consid
ered diverse if they have a sufficiently high 
proportion of non-white students. This defi
nition ignores other kinds of diversity, 
such as socioeconomic and geographical. 
Sure, schools take it into account, but it car
ries far less weight than racial diversity. 
Our current criterion of only race-based 
diversity ignores the vast diversity withEDITORIAL STAFF
America has come a long way towards 
racial equality since the time of Martin 
Luther King Jr. However, the controversy 
over the University of Michigans race-based 
admissions policy proves that we still have a 
long way to go. Last Monday, Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared Cohon gave his 
annual address on the state of diversity at 
CMU. After a lengthy discussion about the 
needs of international students, he moved 
on to the dreaded numbers. At least he came 
out and said it: We practice affirmative 
action, to much applause.
Despite President Cohons contention that 
affirmative action is not unfair, there is no 
reasonable way to deny that it is indeed 
inequitable. He said himself that while the 
acceptance rate at CMU for African 
Americans and Hispanics is 51 percent; the 
overall acceptance rate for the university is 
36 percent. The University of Michigan evi

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 27, 2003
McCain was a friend of mine: the rise and fall of a renaissance man
MMMMR.
.apwBsfc.r*A long time ago I was a Republican. All right
 actually I was an independent who support
ed a Republican. During the 2000 presidential 
election, I worked as a campaign volunteer for 
Senator John McCain in his bid for the White 
House. I surrendered to McCain, totally and 
completely. He made me believe that politics 
didnt have to be dominated by a helmet-coifed, 
glad-handing elite, that it could be an everymans game. John McCain represented for me a 
breath of fresh air in the stark ugliness of the 
present political climate.
Like other volunteers in a campaign atmos
phere, The Cause became bigger than anything 
else and it magically sucked the wind out of 
every gainsayer I met. At my worst, I refused to 
listerCio any criticism of the man, warranted or 
otherwise.
However, two years later, he is still Senator 
John McCain. That maverick politician I was 
originally smitten with never won the White 
House, packed in the Straight Talk Express, 
and hot-footed it back to the Russell Office 
Building.
He has since disappointed me, with his 
hypocrisy, his fatuity, and mostly, his sameness; 
to everything else in Washington, D.C. John 
McCain is no friend of mine.
Now before you mistake all this for some 
heap of Nietzschean hero-worship-gone-sour, 
understand this is no Der Fall Wagner. I actual
ly believed in the guy. His were the kind of 
ideals I could call my own, plainspoken in a 
Micldie-American sort of way without the pro
lixity of Bill Clinton.
~The: problem is, McCain never truly believed
To be honest, I was hesitated to write this col
umn. I had actually made several abortive 
starts at it, but each time I kept telling myself 
that 1 was in the minority and that GSIA and 
CIT knew what they were doing.
After The Tartan printed an article last week 
about student concerns over the joint GSIA/CIT 
MBA program, however, I felt I had to speak as 
someone whos seen both sides of the fence.
As both a current GSIA MBA student and an 
alumnus of CIT, I strongly feel that the new 
jdrntprogram is a step in the wrong direction. I
his own words.
On his Senate webpage biography, McCain is 
messianic; alternately, he has waged a deter
mined and often solitary campaign against pork 
barrel spending, been an outspoken advocate 
for the reform of government institutions, and 
is one of the leading defenders of the rights of 
Native Americans. To quote a similarly irritat
ed George Will: Well. McCain, despite his big 
talk about campaign finance reform and 
malfeasance, has failed to exercise even a mod
icum of propriety when it comes to his corpo
rate contributors. Witness his tacked-on con
demnation of the recent scandals in a July 2002 
radio interview  McCain decried the actions 
of the CEOs, and exposed the evils of unfet
tered capitalism. Ironic that, since some of 
these capitalist pigs share the trough with the 
senator.
For example, Global Crossing gave McCain 
$31,000 in contributions between 1997 and
2001, making him Crossings top senatorial 
recipient during that period. WorldCom, anoth
er culprit, contributed $23,900 between 1989-
2002, making McCain the third top recipient of 
the bankrupt corporations money. In addition 
to Arthur Andersen - he got $23,250 - McCain 
received $9,500 from that beacon of corporate 
avarice, Enron, tallying the twelfth highest 
amount of money among senators from 1989- 
2001.
Unfortunately, McCains mendicancy isnt his 
only brush with corporate corruption. Charles 
Keating, the developer and head of the 
American Continental Corp., spread a lot of 
money around Washington in 1987 looking for 
protection from a government seizure of his 
holdings. McCain was an old Keating friend. On 
April 1986, McCains wife and her father had 
invested $359,100 in a Keating shopping center, 
a year before the senator met with the regula
tors. There were also a handful of trips for the 
McCains at Keatings expense during this time,
understand the proposed reasons for such a 
program. CIT students undergo a demanding 
technical program that meshes very well with 
the quantitative nature of GSIA.
Selected students can quickly blend technical 
and business knowledge to improve their over
all skills while finishing an advanced degree in 
a shorter period of time.
However, the drawbacks from having inexpe
rienced students more than outweighs any ben
efits. As almost anyone will tell you, a major 
component in the strength of an MBA is the stureports the Arizona Republic, an independent 
statewide newspaper. Keating received no rec
ompense for the trips until years later, at a total 
cost of $13,433.
The timing of this largesse? Keating was 
embroiled in the Lincoln trial and facing testi
mony that might indict his Washington friends. 
The Keating Five scandal, an event that McCain, 
has called his asterisk, raises more questions 
than answers about the Senators stance on a 
truly corruption-free government.
I will never be a John McCain supporter 
again. Along with his hypocritical campaigndent body.
Placing inexperienced CIT students, no mat
ter their academic prowess, in GSIA will only 
detract from the program and shortchange the 
very students it is designed to help.
In my time at GSIA, Ive found that my fellow 
students contribute a great deal to my learning. 
My project groups have included people with 
experience in finance, operations, IT and soft
ware, and numerous other functional areas.
Ive brought specific experience in opera
tions, quality, and IT. Together, my teammates 
and I have leveraged knowledge in steel, on
line markets, electronics, finance, logistics, and 
many more areas.
All of this varied experience contributes to 
the learning process in very significant ways. 
Except for older students who have worked 
before coming to or while attending Carnegie 
Mellon, CIT students would simply not have 
this experience.
This is not to say they would not contribute 
or learn; their contributions would simply be 
limited.
In several classes and projects, both I and my 
fellow classmates have proposed solutions only 
to be told of a more realistic solution by some
one with much more direct experience.
These students would also face their most 
difficult challenges in Management Game, a 
computer simulation of a consumer products 
company.
Here they will answer to board members who 
are working professionals. By tying in real 
world events and concepts, they will force stu
dents to address real concerns.
My Game team had a broad range of know
how to draw upon, just like all other Game 
teams that had experienced MBA students.
These inexperienced CIT students would be 
hard pressed to do the same. GSIA and CIT 
attempted to respond to this concern by requir
ing students to have internships. While intern
ships provide a valuable experience, they in no 
way replace the knowledge one gets from work
ing day after day for several years.
I noted earlier that I was a bit reluctant to 
write this column. I graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon in 1993 with a degree in chemical engi
neering. I know how demanding it can be, and 
I have no doubt whatsoever that selected CIT 
students could handle the academic workload 
of GSIA.
In fact, theyll most likely find themselves 
much more prepared for both the quantitative 
aspects and the stress level than many nonAnnalisa Schaefer/Art Staff
finance lip service, McCain has forfeited his 
maverick status by supporting to the hilt a 
war with Iraq that a growing number of 
Americans are expressing skepticism over. 
Truly, an out-of-the-box thinker as McCain con
sciously fashions himself would not dogmati
cally countenance such a foolhardy endeavor 
but question the effectiveness of an Iraq inva
sion. But, then again, I dont expect much from 
John McCain anymore.

Editor and a former Forum editor.
Carnegie Mellon graduates.
However, the fact remains that such a pro
gram will shortchange both students and regu
lar MBA students.
It can also adversely affect GSIAs rankings. 
Personally, I think most of these ratings are 
bunk. US News and World Reports rankings 
are highly skewed toward larger institutions 
and an incestuous academic reputation fac
tor.
The Wall Street Journals rankings caused a 
ruckus because GSIA shot up when recruiters, 
the buyers of MBA talent, were asked what they 
thought. Still, many people place much weight 
on rankings, and the admission of inexperi
enced students can severely hurt the GSIAs 
reputation
Since current MBA students had little warn
ing and the program has already been 
announced, its a done deal. However, I offer 
the administration a few suggestions to salvage 
things while still serving some expectant CIT 
students.
First, shift the emphasis to students interest
ed in finance or similar industries where a 
strong computational/engineering background 
is desired.
The press releases Ive seen stress this partic
ular advantage GSIA has. Finance-related com
panies have often hired new engineers, so this 
makes for a natural progression.
Next, consider shifting the program to a FlexTime system. Admitted students would have to 
secure full-time professional work.
The program length would probably have to 
be lengthened to six years, but at least the stu
dents would have a few years work experience 
by the time they hit Game or their final year.
Finally, consider a probationary period 
where students would be evaluated by profes
sors and possibly regular Fullor Flex-Time stu
dents assigned as mentors. This would more 
accurately assess their maturity and contribu
tion to the program.
These ideas may have been considered 
already, but as people know, we received very 
little notice. Ideally, I would scrap the program, 
but Im sure that several aggressive, capable 
CIT students are already planning on complet
ing the program. Maybe GSLA can make a bad 
idea not so bad.

MBA student and alumnus (Chem E 93). He won
ders why people from other colleges were not 
offered the same opportunity.
GSIA, CIT take a premature leap

ATONEMENT, from page A8
in races. A white male from rural 
Texas would add a lot of diversity to 
CMU, but of course the former part of 
this description does not matter if 
race-based diversity is the goal.
 Admissions put too much emphasis 
on what makes a pretty picture for 
their brochures. Thus, basing diver
sity solely on race is insufficient, 
despite our reliance on it.
The goal of getting enough minori
ties into the student body, whatever 
that number may be, broaches a sec
ond problem: achieving diversity 
implies quotas, yet the Supreme 
Court has deemed quotas unconstitu
tional.
President Cohon showed in his 
speech that the fall 2002 freshman 
class was 6 percent African American 
and 5 percent Hispanic. He said these 
numbers need to go up. Thats not 
going to happen unless the admis
sions department makes it happen. 
They are not going to use the Q 
word, but the result will be the same 
and they will use unfair means such 
as affirmative action to achieve it.
These unfair means flow from a 
definition of diversity that requires 
an implementation strategy that only 
works one way. diversity is 
achieved by having a magic propor
tion of only non-white students. This 
is how most college admissions 
guides define it. A close look at the 
numbers from Cohons speech 
reveals that there are actually more 
Asian students (which include 
Indians) at CMU than there are white 
students. So does this mean admis
sions will start replacing the largest 
group (Asians) with blacks and 
Hispanics in order to achieve more 
diversity? Of course not! White stu
dents will always be the first to go at 
every university, no matter how few 
there are.
Some colleges with a gigantic 
Asian population might be an excep
tion, but Im sure we arent there yet. 
Admissions is a zero sum game, and 
given our definition of diversity, 
white students will almost always be 
on the negative side. What it comes 
down to is this: trying to improve 
diversity implies a racist admis
sions policy, diversity cant be used 
to justify affirmative action. Two 
wrongs dont make a right.
Obviously the Holy Grail of diver
sity is not a universally convincing 
justification for affirmative action. 
Recently we have seen even the top 
members of the Bush Administration 
take opposing views. We see that the 
cse for affirmative action is not as 
clear-cut as academia believes; their 
desperate clinging to the esoteric 
idea of diversity is no defense. I 
would like to think that the end of 
this debate will come on the 
inevitable day when race no longer 
appears on any kind of application. 
The Supreme Court has a chance to 
bring us closer to that day.

SAN DIEGO (AP)  Just defense, 
baby!
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers didn't 
need much more to win their first 
Super Bowl.
Coach Jon Gruden and his Bucs 
routed the Oakland Raiders 48-21 on 
Sunday in the first matchup of the 
best offense vs. best defense.
The Tampa Bay defense won by a 
mile, returning three of a record five 
interceptions for touchdowns and 
shutting down any hope the Raiders 
had of a late comeback.
It wasnt that much of a challenge 
for us, Tampa Bay defensive tackle 
Warren Sapp said.
The victory was especially sweet 
for the former NFL laughingstock, a 
team that lost its first 26 games after 
it started playing in 1976 in those gar
ish orange uniforms.
I want to thank Coach Gruden for 
what he did, said Bucs owner 
Malcolm Glazer, who a year ago was 
the butt of jokes for his revolving 
coach search that finally brought 
Gruden from the Raiders.
He came from heaven and he 
brought us to heaven. We were wait
ing for the right man and the right 
man came  Jon Gruden.
Gruden, who at 39 became the 
youngest coach ever to win a Super 
Bowl, is known as an offensive guru. 
This victory was with a defense run 
by Monte Kiffin and other holdovers 
from former coach Tony Dungy.
Im not saying its the best defense 
I've ever seen, said Tim Brown, the 
36-year-old Oakland receiver who 
was in his first Super Bowl in 15 NFL 
seasons.
But its really very good defense.
Super Bowl MVP Dexter Jackson 
had two interceptions, as did Dwight 
Smith, who returned both of his picks 
for touchdowns, including a 50- 
yarder to finish off the scoring with 
two seconds left in the game. Derrick 
Brooks also returned an interception 
for a touchdown.
Simeon Rice had two of the Bucs 
five sacks as Tampa Bay romped to a 
20-3 halftime lead then scored two 
quick third-quarter touchdowns.
That rendered futile a late come
back by the Raiders that included a 
touchdown on a blocked punt and 
48-yard touchdown pass from league 
MVP Rich Gannon to Jerry Rice.
Right now, I wouldn't care if they 
put Mount Everest in front of me, 
said Simeon Rice, who was playing 
against a line of all 300-pounders. I 
just wanted to be a world champion.
The Bucs limited the Raiders to 19 
yards rushing, 269 total yards and 
just 11 first downs.
The Tampa Bay offense did its part, 
too, led by Michael Pittman, who ran 
for 124 yards on 29 carries.
Mike Alstott had a 2-yard touch
down run and Brad Johnson added 
two touchdown passes to Keenan 
McCardell, the second an 11-yarder 
after an 89-yard drive that ate up 
almost eight minutes of the third 
quarter.
Just 43 seconds later, Smith 
grabbed the ball away from Jerry
Rice and took it to the end zone to 
make it 34-3.
Oakland owner A1 Daviss slogan 
Just win, baby! wasn't going to 
work this time.
How good was the Tampa Bay 
defense?
Oakland had just 62 total yards in 
the first half, second-lowest total in 
Super Bowl history. And the five 
interceptions of Gannon were the 
most he had in any game this season. 
He finished 24-for-44 for 272 yards 
and two touchdowns.
We were absolutely terrible, 
Gannon said. It was a nightmarish 
performance.
Credit the victory also to Gruden, 
who left Oakland for Tampa Bay in 
what seemed at the time far too much 
in draft picks and cash  $8 million 
to be exact.
Although Gruden denied it, his 
knowledge of his old team worked 
out perfectly.
Kiffin, the defensive coordinator, 
wasn't surprised the Bucs seemed to 
know just about everything the 
Raiders would do.
Jon Gruden was Gannon. Nobody 
can be like Gannon like Gruden can, 
Kiffen said. He taught Gannon. He 
was in Gannon's head.
To be fair, the Raiders might have 
entered this game a bit distracted.
Their All-Pro center, Barret 
Robbins, was dismissed for the game 
for missing team functions Saturday. 
The Bucs took advantage, with Sapp, 
Lynch and the interior defense push
ing up the middle constantly against 
backup center Adam Treu to put pres
sure on Gannon and shut down the 
run.
This was a victory for one of the 
NFL's longtime sad sacks.
Between 1983 and 1996, the Bucs 
were the league's worst franchise, 
going without a winning season and 
losing 10 or more games in 13 of 
those 14 years.
Even a year ago, the team was a 
mess after the Glazer family fired 
Dungy and went after big-name 
coaches like Bill Parcells and Steve 
Mariucci before landing Gruden.
But if this was a glorious day for 
the Bucs, it was the opposite for the 
Raiders, who have three Super Bowl 
victories but hadn't been back to pro 
footballs showcase game in 19 years.
Oaklands aging warriors did little.
Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, the 40- 
and 36-year-old wide receivers, were 
all but invisible for most of the game.
Rice, who has a reception in every 
game hes played since 1985, didnt 
have his first until 3:30 was left in the
third quarter Sunday and the Raiders 
trailed by 31 points.
That came just before Gannons 39- 
yard touchdown pass to Jerry Porter 
gave the Raiders their first touch
down. They got their second just 44 
seconds into the fourth quarter when 
Tim Johnson blocked a Tom Tupa 
punt and Eric Johnson caught it in 
the air and took it in.
But even those touchdowns didnt 
produce what they could have 
because the Raiders twice missed 
two-point conversion attempts.
Tampa Bay started badly, but it 
soon took control and led 20-3 at 
halftime on a 2-yard touchdown run 
by Alstott and a 5-yard TD pass to 
McCardell. The defense held the 
Raiders top-ranked offense to just 
three first downs at intermission.
But the Raiders struck the first 
blow.
On the opening series, Johnson 
was hit by Regan Upshaw as he threw 
toward an open McCardell, and 
Charles Woodson intercepted to give 
the Raiders the ball at the Tampa Bay 
28.
But Oakland got only one first 
down and had to settle for Sebastian 
Janikowskis 40-yard field goal to 
take a 3-0 lead.
The Bucs came right back to tie it 
on Martin Gramaticas 31-yarder. It 
was set up by two 23-yard plays, a 
pass from Johnson to Joe Jurevicius 
and a sweep by Pittman.
Jackson's first interception for 
Tampa Bay set up the next score: 
Gramaticas 43-yard field goal early 
in the second quarter to give the Bucs 
a 6-3 lead.
Jackson got another interception 
on the Raiders next possession, 
returning it 23 yards to the Raiders' 
45. Tampa Bay couldn't move and 
Tom Tupa had to punt.
But the Tampa Bay defense held 
the Raiders to three downs and out, 
and the Bucs finally broke through to 
take a 13-3 lead.
First Karl Williams returned Shane 
Lechler's punt 25 yards to the 
Oakland 27, then Pittman had runs of 
6 and 21 yards to give Tampa Bay a 
first down at the 2. On the second 
play, Alstott went in for the game's 
first touchdown with 6:24 left in the 
half.  -
The Bucs made it 20-3 at halftime 
on a 77-yard, 10-play drive, which 
was aided by three Oakland penalties 
and capped by a quick out to 
McCardell on first down from the 5.
The second half featured the come
back and the counter-comeback. But 
it was never really in doubt.

THE TARTAN27 January 2003
Tartans leave Allegheny College in wakeWomen win 
one despite 
poor offense
Super Sunday: 
peace averted, 
normals cheer
nmIue/mIImPoE
Of course, the usual suspects for 
the men did their part too. Junior 
Brian McCarthy recorded a time of 
1:57.90 in the 200-yard backstroke, 
and handily won the 200-yard indi
vidual medley (IM) with a time of 
1:55.27. This time also earned him a 
provisional NCAA cut (B-cut). In 
addition, sophomore Chris Pearson 
took the 200-yard freestyle with a 
time of 1:41.41, and made an 
unconditional NCAA cut (A-cut) in 
the 500-yard freestyle with his time 
of 4:34.87.
On the womens side, the perfor
mance of the day was by first-year 
Allison Theus, who won the 100- 
yard fly (1:00.11), the 200-yard IM 
(2:16.06), the 200-yard fly 
(2:18.00). Her time in the 100 fly 
marked a career best for her, and 
she was also on the winning relay 
team in the 400-yard freestyle.
Also having solid days were junior 
Corey Ginsberg in the 100- and 200- 
yard breaststroke
(l:11.72/2;34.86), junior Julie 
Tibor in the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle (25.85/55.46), and senior 
Mei-Lan Ho-Walker in the 200-yard 
freestyle (2:01.23).
And finally, the diving duo of 
sophomore Mindi Finnegan and 
first-year Julie Pavia worked their 
magic again, as they recorded 
national qualifying times in both the 
1-meter and 3-meter dive.
It was an impressive finish for 
both teams, particularly the women, 
who have improved tremendously 
over the last three years.
Im so very happy with how the 
girls swam, said Belowich. They 
are a good, powerful team.
Now that the regular season has 
concluded, the Tartans turn their 
attention to training for the UAA 
championships in three weeks. They 
are likely to face a more difficult 
opponent then, as the UAA contains 
some very tough competitors, 
including perennial powerhouse 
Emory. If this season is any indica
tion, the Tartans should prove equal 
to the task.
With the wins, the womens team 
finished the season with a 6-1 
record in dual meets, their second 
consecutive such record. The men 
ended their third consecutive unde
feated season, going 7-0 in dual 
meets.
The meet also marked the final 
dual meet for the teams seniors, 
who have enjoyed enormous suc
cess in their four years at CMU. The 
women have only lost four meets in 
that time, while the men have won 
every meet but one.
Its a pretty good tradition here, 
said Belowich. And the seniors pass 
this attitude down to the freshmen, 
who get used to winning.
There were several dominating 
individual performances by the 
men, including junior Brian 
Belowich who won the 100-yard 
breaststroke (1:01.13), junior Brian 
Jucha in the 100-yard fly (52.64) 
and 50-yard freestyle (22.18), and 
first-year Evan Powell in the 100- 
yard backstroke (56.21) and 100- 
yard freestyle (48.63).

On Saturday, the Tartan swim
mers played host to the Gators of 
Allegheny College and rattled off a 
pair of victories.
The scores read 129-123 for the 
women and 124-113 for the men, 
but neither margin comes close to 
describing how thoroughly the visi
tors were dominated.
A team can choose to swim cer
tain events as exhibition events, 
meaning that they receive no score 
for those events.
The Tartans elected to swim exhi
bition in nearly half of the events on 
the day, and won most of those any
way.
We thought it was going to be a 
closer meet than it was, said head 
coach David Belowich. We could 
have won pretty much whatever we 
wanted ... but there was no need to 
run up the score or embarrass any
body.

So another NFL season is over, 
sports fans, and frankly I am more 
than a little surprised with the way it 
ended. Dont get me wrong, I knew 
the Bucs would win, but I dont think 
anyone could predict the explosion 
that we saw from Tampa Bay today.
On a day that should be made a 
national holiday, it wasnt just the 
protestors wasting their time in front 
of the Software Engineering Institute 
that caused a disturbance. The 
Buccaneers sent a ripple through the 
NFL that will be felt for years to come. 
But they werent the only ones who 
took advantage of the afternoon. 
While the peace lovers waved their 
signs and sang their silly songs, the 
normals were preparing for the 
biggest football event of the year: 
fried chicken was bought, chips were 
smothered with cheese and heated, 
and beer was chilled. All this was in 
anticipation for the event that comes 
but once a year: the Super Bowl. And 
let me tell you, my devoted readers, I 
spared no expense. I played host to a 
number of good friends, shared some 
quality drinks, and some quality 
laughs, because that is really what 
this game is all about.
Sure, it is the football champi
onship, the biggest game of many 
players careers; but that doesnt limit 
the day to just football. Its about 
gathering around a 27 flat screen 
TV, putting on the surround sound, 
sitting back and enjoying the compa
ny just as much as the one does the 
game. Its about sharing your first 
legal drink with your father, or one of 
your many illegal ones with your frat 
brothers. Its about getting closer to 
people you dont really know and 
about cheering for a team that beat 
your team in the second round of the 
playoffs, just because you picked 
them to win.
Its about having a good time, and 
no matter how much you hate the 
pending war in Iraq, and to diminish 
the value of a day like today is a damn 
shame. In case you havent figured it 
out I was more than annoyed by the 
protest, I was offended. Today was a 
day to come together, not to create a 
gap. Unless you were a Raiders fan, 
save your senseless, idealist, bitching 
for another day. Today was Super 
Bowl Sunday, and it shouldve been 
held in the highest regard. To the 
blasphemers that kept me in traffic 
on Fifth Avenue: I pity you, I pity your 
naivete, I pity your stupidity, and I 
pity the fools who put a damper on a 
day that should bring this country 
together over its favorite sport. You 
truly do take advantage of this great 
nation.
In case you didnt push your way 
through the protest to see the game, 
you missed one of the best defensive 
displays the NFL has ever seen. The 
favored and highly respected Raider 
offense was shut down through the 
entire game, save one or two plays in 
the second half. I figured the Bucs 
offense was good for at least three 
scores, which they got, but they, as 
they have been the last several years, 
remained in the defenses shadow. 
Most valuable player Dexter Jackson 
was a highlight reel, with two key 
picks on league MVP Rich Gannon, 
but the whole defense was amazing. I 
watched with my mouth open in the 
first half, as did the rest of the world. 
The Bucs dominated the Raiders 
offensive line; they put pressure on 
Gannon (something he wasnt used 
to), and created turnovers.
I fell into the trap during the week, 
and thought the Raider offense really 
could put up a fight, but I was 
reminded on Sunday that it is the 
defense that wins championships. My 
analysis of the game is simple: the 
Buccaneers threw a huge monkey off 
their back. For the last three or four 
years they have been expected to win 
the Super Bowl with defense, and for 
years they have choked in the play
offs. This year they took out all their 
frustration on a confused Raider 
offense. Gannon did not know what 
to do, Callahan had Gruden in his 
head, and Tim Brown and Jerry Rice 
were well covered by Monty Kiffens 
number one defense.
The Raiders were outplayed on 
both sides of the ball, but it was the 
lack of offense that broke their back. 
Oakland couldve won if Tampa Bay 
had put up three offensive touch
downs, but it wasnt meant to be a 
shootout. The Bucs offense didnt 
need to score at all. Warren Sapp, 
Derrick Brooks, John Lynch, and the 
rest of the number one defense in the 
league took care of everything. They 
finally rose to the challenge. They 
finally claimed their rightful place 
among the best defenses of all time, 
and they finally won a championship, 
despite the Raiders protests.
The CMU womens basketball team 
(10-6 overall, 2-3 UAA) entered 
Sundays contest against Washington 
University hopeful, but realistic. This 
was a Bears team after all that was 
riding a 46 consecutive regular sea
son win streak, 71 consecutive regu
lar season wins, and 24 straight 
University Athletic Association victo
ries. To follow up their three-point 
victory against Chicago last Friday, 
the Tartans planned for a competitive 
game against the top-ranked Wash. 
U. Bears in St. Louis. Unfortunately, 
Wash. U. was not so accommodating. 
The Bears (16-0, 5-0) relied on effec
tive bench play and solid shooting en 
route to putting four players in dou
ble figures as they prevailed 74-53.
Washington hit their first five out 
of six shots, benefiting from the hot 
hands of guards Leslie Hawley and 
Laura Crowley. The Bears went on a 
8-0 run with 9:51 left in the first half, 
taking a commanding 23-9 lead. 
Wash U. first-year guard Kelly 
Manning added 12 of her game-high 
18 points from the bench, including a 
perfect seven-of-seven from the line. 
In the first half, CMU was plagued by 
shooting troubles, hitting 11 of 28 
from the field for .393. The Bears, 
meanwhile, responded with a scintil
lating .520 (13-25) performance, 
including 5 for 11 from behind the 
three-point arc. Wash. U. went 13-15 
at the free throw line.
We did not execute well on 
offense, said CMU head coach Gerri 
Seidl. [In the first half], we did not 
execute the pick-and-roll.
Wash. U. continued the offensive 
deluge in the second half, kicking off 
play with a 15-6 run over the Tartans. 
The Bears took their largest lead of 
the game, 59-33, during this scoring 
spree and pulled away with 12:37 
remaining in the game.
Even Seidl was forced to concede 
,the Bears offensive superiority on a 
day when Carnegie Mellon was 
dwarfed on bench production and 
gave up 20 points on turnovers.
With 9:46 remaining, sophomore 
guard Lisa Seacat brought the Bears 
lead under 20 points, but the Bears 
responded with a seven straight 
points. Carnegie Mellon never again 
mustered any legitimate come-back, 
racking up only 5 second chance 
points on their way to being outrebounded 39-20. Paint play was 
likewise productive, as Washington 
scored 32 points under the basket.
I dont know whether it was our 
sloppiness so much as their intensity, 
said forward Carissa Sain. The junior 
led the team with 10 points but com
mitted 6 turnovers in what could be 
considered a microcosm of Tartans' 
afternoon, solid play overshadowed 
by a superior opponents ability to be 
everywhere on the court. You cant 
appreciate Wash. U. until you go out 
and play them, continued Sain.
The Carnegie Mellon win over 
University of Chicago (6-8 overall, 
1-3 UAA) last Friday, however, was a 
welcome, if unsatisfying, consolation 
prize. The Tartans triumphed over 
the Maroons in a down-to-the-wire 
win. With 2:19 remaining, the CMU 
lead was 53-50 after a Marcia 
Valencia layup. Following a series of 
turnovers and missed shots, Chicago 
guard Paula Lepka put the Maroons 
within a point off a jump-shot with 
seven seconds left to play. Senior 
guard Michelle Sodini hit both of her 
free-throws after being fouled with 
four seconds remaining. Chicago 
then turned over the ball on the 
inbounds play with one second on the 
clock, giving the Tartans the win, 
55-52. The Tartans next take on 
Emory University at home on January 
31. The Eagles are 6-6 on the season, 
having lost four in a row.

CMU swimming is enjoying another stellar season, having dropped just one meet in the past 14 contests.
Club hockey embarrassed twice over weekend
putting another forceful close goal past Garmat.
Trailing for the first time in the game, Carnegie 
Mellon sought to even the score again, and less 
than a minute later, a two man breakaway devel
oped. The Pittsburgh goalie stopped the Kevin 
Hutchinson shot and subsequently fell into the 
net with the puck, scoring for the Tartans. With 
the score knotted at three each, the Panthers 
stuffed another Carnegie Mellon power play 
heading into the second intermission.
The Panther defense dominated the third peri
od killing another CMU man advantage. Junior 
center Jamie Bretz launched a good shot toward 
the Panther net, but the Pittsburgh net minder 
gloved the puck.
Two minutes before the end of regulation, the 
score was still tied.
Carnegie Mellon was given another chance to 
accomplish what had eluded them all evening: to 
score a power play goal. But the Panthers, deter
mined to win, continued to dominate while 
shorthanded.
They once again outshot the Tartans and with 
38 seconds remaining, sophomore forward Pat 
OHara scored the shorthanded goal, a hat trick, 
and a devastating blow on CMUs chances to win 
the game.
Coming off the 43 loss to the Panthers, the 
team looked to rebound against Slippery Rock 
Saturday night on home ice.. It became apparent
early that the speed possessed by the Rock lines 
would give them trouble.
The Tartans first major chance occurred when 
the Rock goaltender pulled far out of the crease 
to retrieve a deep shot. The Tartans crossed the 
puck but he returned to the net in time to make 
the quick save. The save was a sign of what the 
team was to face for the rest of the evening.
Carnegie Mellon held the Rock scoreless 
through the opening 17, but an early hooking 
penalty against the Tartans gave Slippery Rock 
their first chance of the period. Rock forward 
Derek Burda's subsequent power play goal 
opened scoring for the evening.
The Rock took a 3-0 lead on two goals a 
minute apart: the first on a wrap around from 
behind the goal and the second on a breakaway 
from the left.
Nollen stopped the SRU run with a short goal 
crossing from left to right off a Brian Schmella. 
The two-goal deficit was as far as the CMU 
offense got them. Slippery Rock added their 
fourth goal of the second period in the waning 
seconds of a Tartan penalty.
Slippery Rock's Joe McGee scored their fifth 
goal shorthanded, in a third-period which saw 
the Tartans squander a minute-long two man 
advantage. The Rock defense crushed any oppor
tunity for CMU to close the gap, and left the ice 
with a 5-1 victory.

Coming off a 14-2 exhibition win last week, 
the Tartans (4-5) had high hopes for this week
ends games against regional rivals University of 
Pittsburgh and Slippery Rock. Carnegie Mellon 
won earlier this season against Pittsburgh 6-2. 
This weekend they did not fare so well.
Facing Pittsburgh Friday evening at the Airport 
Arena, the Tartans started strong, with junior for
ward Mike Nollen scoring a short quick goal. 
Senior wing D.J. Book added another over the 
goaltenders shoulder, and CMU led 2-0 after 
seven minutes.
Pitt quickly recovered, and two minutes later, 
capitalized on a man advantage. The Pittsburgh 
line pulled Tartan goaltender Dan Garmat off the 
corner of the net and closed the score gap to one. 
The Panthers started to dominate statistically, 
outshooting the Tartans. The Pittsburgh inside 
presence pounded another goal into the net with 
five minutes to play to tie the score at two apiece.
The Tartans opened the second period on a 
four-minute man advantage due to consecutive 
Panther minor penalties but were once again 
denied a score on the power play. When the 
Pittsburgh line regained full strength, they wast
ed little time in taking their first lead of the game,
Mens basketball suffers two losses on western trip
on a 26-13 run and left the court 
with a commanding 44-26 lead.
The second half started with seven 
Maroon points and a Chicago lead 
that grew as large as 23 points before 
the Tartans started to cut into it. Led 
by sophomore Michael Divens and 
junior Matthew Kaitz, who finished 
with a team-high 23 points, the 
Tartans cut the lead to 15 points with 
12 minutes to go, and eventually to 
seven after Divens layup with four 
minutes to play.
But the Carnegie Mellon offense 
could not close those remaining 
seven points and the Maroons hit the 
remainder of their free throws and 
punctuated the 74-63 victory with a 
rare dunk.
After their loss in Chicago, the 
team travelled southwest for
Sundays game against Washington. 
The game pitted CMU up against the 
first-ranked team in Division III. The 
Bears (16-0, 5-0) started the game 
conservatively and the Tartans were 
able to keep it close, trailing only 
14-12 with seven minutes gone.
A minute later, following a threepointer by senior center Jarriot 
Rook, Washington started to pull 
away from the Tartans finishing the 
half on a 17-10 run.
Down only seven points, the 
Tartans came out of the intermission 
with a chance to upset the topranked Bears.
They allowed this opportunity to 
slip through their collective fingers 
and Washington started the period 
on a 36-13 run led by senior forward 
Chris Jefferies.

The mens basketball team (8-7 
overall, 2-3 UAA) faced one of their 
most difficult road trips of the sea
son this weekend, traveling to the 
University of Chicago and 
Washington University in St. Louis.
On Friday, the men faced the 
Chicago Maroons (7-8, 3-1) at the 
Henry Crown Field House. Chicago 
steadily built their lead off the shoot
ing hand of senior forward Derek 
Reich. Reich, who scored his 2,000th 
career point becoming the only play
er in Chicago history to pass that 
mark, scored 29 points and grabbed 
14 rebounds for the game.
The Maroons ended the first half

Locks of Love:
Cutting it all off for a good cause
Theres no end to the advertisements that offer mira
cle cures to adults with thinning hair, but there are 
few such options for the four million children in this 
nation who suffer from medical hair loss. In an ele
mentary or secondary school  where kids are 
teased for being just the slightest bit different  
imagine what it must be like for someone with alope
cia areata, or a young chemotherapy patient. On top 
of dealing with an illness, they also face the pain of 
being ostracized by their peers for conditions beyond 
their control. But now, thanks to Locks of Love, a 
young but growing charitable organization, these 
kids no longer have to be ashamed.
Since Locks of Love (LOL) was founded in 1997, the 
nonprofit organization has donated over 850 custommade hairpieces to financially disadvantaged 6 to 17- 
year-olds with medical hair loss. Unlike standard 
commercial wigs  which typically cost upwards of 
$3,000  LOLs vacuum-fit hairpieces require no 
tape or glue, and therefore dont agitate childrens 
sensitive scalps. And unlike commercial prosthetics, 
LOLs wigs are made entirely of donated human hair.

Patty Lesic is a manager at the Sears Hair Studio in 
Pittsburghs Ross Park Mall. Her store runs a local 
chapter of LOL, and in the last three months alone, 
shes sent 22 donated ponytails to the organizations 
headquarters in Lake Worth, Florida. As incentive for 
potential donors, Lesics salon offers free haircuts on 
Mondays to anyone who will shear their long mane 
for charity. She believes that donating to LOL bene
fits the donor as well as the recipient.
It works in a circle, Lesic explains. If you give, 
youre blessed. Good comes from good.
Erin Hoelzle, the manager of the Oakland Supercuts 
(another local LOL affiliate), recognizes the charitys 
impact on children's self-esteem and confidence:

The Oakland Supercuts gives haircuts for charity.
Being in the image business, we know how impor
tant [appearances] are, especially for children who 
spend so much time at school. For them, the outside 
is just as important as the inside.
Each LOL hairpiece is handcrafted, and on average, it 
takes 15 donations to make one hairpiece. Since bind
ing hair to a wig foundation uses up two inches of 
hair, and since most LOL recipients are little girls who 
want long curls, LOL asks that all donated ponytails 
measure at least ten inches from tip to tip. However, 
shorter segments of hair are also accepted, sold at fair 
market value, and used to offset the cost of manufac
turing.
The official LOL website (www.locksoflove.org) 
reports that almost 80 percent of donors are children 
who want to help other children, but Patty Lesic says 
that youd be surprised how many men come in. 
[About] a quarter of our donors are men.
Lesic also says that a lot of donors are women who 
feel like its time for a makeover.
If youre going to do it, you might as well do it for a 
good cause. And I have cut some beautiful, long hair
 but I always make sure they leave with a great hair
cut.

Missing a Pulse:
Reggae outfit Caribbean Pulse fails to impressMaestro:
Renowned Russian cellist to speak at CMU

Some band names evoke a stereotypical response. Names like Metallica, 
Poison, and Anthrax let you know immediately that youre in for some hard 
rock. And when you hear a name like N*SYNC or O-Town, you know to be 
prepared for synthetic, manufactured pop. So its no surprise that Caribbean 
Pulse, a five-member reggae band, fills every moment of their music with 
upstrokes and guys that sound like Shaggy.
Currently, Caribbean Pulse isnt well-known in the US, but allegedly theyre 
making a great impression on the American reggae festival circuit. Their web
site, CaribbeanPulse.com, claims theyve been captivating audiences in the US, 
from Californias Reggae Old School Jam and the Sea Breeze Festival to the 
Reggae Soca Award show in Florida. And Reggae-Vibes.com heralds the band 
as the newest, most musically diverse, sensation. But so far, the band has yet 
to make any real splash in the States.
Rhythm guitarist William Smith formed the band of unknowns in 1998. The 
most notable contributor to this otherwise unimpressive project is the produc
er of their debut album Stand Up, Fabian Cooke. Cooke has worked with groups 
like Big Mountain, Steel Pulse, and the legendary Bob Marley.
Stand Up was released on Irie Records (home of Cuba Gooding Sr.). Its sound 
is stereotypically reggae: staccato upstroke guitars, island rhythm drums, and a 
full horn section. The back of the album is littered with song titles that must be 
borrowed from the reggae handbook: Victory, Unity, Mr. Man, and Join 
Forces. The only notable track is Dry Your Eyes, the bands current single. Its 
spiritually-charged lyrics fail to impress, but it does feature a guest perform
ance by Damian Marley. Damian, a.k.a. Junior Gong, is the youngest of Bob 
Marle/s children and is making a name for himself with his new album 
Halfway Tree.
Dont try downloading Caribbean Pulse from Kazaa; you can search all day and 
still come up empty-handed. But thats just as well; if you want to hear real reg
gae, buy a Bob Marley album.

Mstislav Slava Rostropovich isnt exactly a household name. But if he 
sounds familiar to you, you know that he's a renowned Russian conductor 
and the worlds preeminent living cellist. You might be planning to see him 
perform with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra this weekend. So why, 
when he comes to the Carnegie Mellon campus this Tuesday, should you go 
hear him speak?
Rostropovich's background is active and diverse. Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 
1927, he started piano lessons with his mother at age 4 and began to learn the 
cello from his father soon afterward. Rostropovich made his public debut as a 
cellist when he was 15, and was later accepted to the Moscow Conservatory, 
where he studied composition with Prokofiev and Shostakovich. He quickly 
earned a reputation as the greatest cellist since Casals.
One-time musical director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, 
D.C., Rostropovich has conducted myriad orchestras. His talent has inspired 
such accomplished composers as Bernstein and Dutilleux to write pieces in his 
honor (Slava! and Slavas Fanfare, respectively, both of which he will be 
performing with the PSO).
Outside of his music, Rostropovich is well known for his vocal defense of 
human rights and democracy. He and his wife Galina Vishnevskaya (the lead
ing soprano in Moscows Bolshoi Opera) sheltered Solzhenitsyn, a man perse
cuted by the Soviet authorities for his anti-Communist writings, in their dacha 
outside Moscow for four years. They also wrote an open letter to Brezhnev, 
protesting Soviet restrictions on artistic freedom. After this bold move, they 
were forbidden to perform, and their citizenship was eventually revoked. They 
left the Soviet Union in 1974, not to return for 16 years.
Rostropovich , and Vishnevskayas emotional homecoming to Russia, touring 
with the National Symphony Orchestra in 1990, was documented in the awardwinning film Soldiers of Music. The next year, during the attempted coup, 
Rostropovich flew to Moscow without a visa and played in the Parliament 
building. For supporting the democratic forces, he received the State Prize of 
Russia.
The Vishnevskaya-Rostropovich Foundation, 
which the couple established in 1991, has 
sent over $5 million in medicine, food, and 
equipment to Russian childrens hospitals.
At 2 pm Tuesday, January 28, in McConomy 
Auditorium, Rostropovich will engage in con
versation with Alan Fletcher, head of the 
Carnegie Mellon School of Music, and Ken 
Meltzer of the PSO. Performing will be the 
Starling Quartet, composed of CMU students 
Jan Fiser and Eunice Keem, violin; Virna 
Cornejo, viola; and Nicole Myers, cello.

Detroit Pop City:
CMUs American Idol hopefuls share a behind-the-scenes scoop
Last October, after junior vocal major Nicole Kaplan 
and senior vocal major Henry ONeill made a trek to 
Detroits American Idol auditions, these are the 
words that Nicole had for the confessional camera:
I just think Simon is a complete asshole, and Ill see 
you on 42nd Street.
As seen on TV, Simon, the often critical and always 
obnoxious judge, certainly gets contestants riled up. 
According to these two Carnegie Mellon students, 
Simon lives up to his reputation, but the audition 
process is even more grueling than it appears.
You dont just walk in and audition, as it seemed on 
the first episode of the second season, which aired 
last week. After Henry drove for five hours Sunday 
night (Nicole slept in the passenger seat), they 
arrived at the downtown Detroit building where 
they would audition. To their surprise, there were 
hundreds of other hopefuls in line outside. It was 3 
am, but they decided to brave the cold night air and 
uncomfortable pavement and wait all night in line.
We hardly got any sleep, Henry recalled. I woke 
up around eight in the morning, just in time to see 
that the line was moving. And the two were 
shocked to find that despite their long wait, they 
would not be auditioning that day. The producers 
gave only 500 of the over 1500 people in the crowd 
the pink wristbands that guaranteed an audition 
that day. The other thousand people got yellow 
wristbands and were told to come back tomorrow.
Yellow wristbands in tow, Henry and Nicole, 
searched for the cheapest hotel room around (a Red
Roof Inn in Little Mac, Michigan) and bought some 
essential supplies. Normally, I wouldnt have been 
spending what little money I had on makeup or hair 
supplies, said Nicole. But we couldnt look like bums 
for the auditions. But in the end, the delay didnt do 
much harm. Both Henry and Nicole were handed 
green slips of paper by producers, tickets to a callback. 
After driving back to Pittsburgh that day, and then 
back to Detroit on the next night, the two arrived 
again, this time able to wait inside.
The atmosphere was so different then, said Nicole. 
It was just so much like the WWF. Before Simon came 
through the waiting area, they actually told us to boo 
him when he came in.
And then Simon said something about how were all 
sure to be terrible because Detroit has no talent, said 
Henry. There were prayer groups and cameras every
where. It was all a big show.
With the pool of hopefuls pared down to about 150, 
Henry and Nicole now auditioned one on one with the 
executive producer.
I sang Take a Look at Me Now, and he liked it, but 
wanted something a bit more pop, said Henry. After I 
sang again, he said, You are an extreme talent, but not 
quite right for this particular assignment, in a preten
tious British accent.
But Nicole got in, Henry laughed.
Nicole advanced to the final audition with Simon, 
Paula Abdul, and the other judges, after singing So 
Emotional by Whitney Houston.
After I sang for them, Simon told me I was hor
rible. I was pretty sure that if Id gotten this far, 
I wasnt horrible, so I informed him that I was 
most comfortable singing arias. Suddenly, 
every one of the 70 cameramen swooped in and 
screamed, Make her sing something from 
school! So I sang an aria for them.
The judges decided that Nicole was not horri
ble, but that she was like a ballerina in a hiphop class, as Paula Abdul put it. It was one of 
the few things she said the whole time, says 
Nicole. Theyre all in Simons pocket. I was 
pretty angry at first, but then I realized that 
none of it really meant anything. Theyre look
ing for entertainment value just as much as tal
ent. I guess we werent bizarre enough for 
them. Neither Henry or I ended up too upset, 
but the confessional caught me at a bad time.
Who knows? I might do it again, adds Nicole.
No way! Henry interjects. Its just crap. Its 
fun crap, but its crap. But wed both like to 
thank Thomas Douglas from the Drama 
Department, whos an amazing guy, for helping 
us prepare for this crap.
Henry and Nicole, who are, despite the ques
tionable opinion of American Idol, superb 
singers, will be appearing in Die Fledermaus this 
weekend, Thursday through Sunday, in Kresge.

Coloring Outside the Lines paints a vivid punk pictureTrue Colors:
Photo Courtesy of Aimee Cooper
Author Aimee Cooper epitomizes punk.
There is no mistaking a moment in your 
life when confusion dissipates, and clarity 
hits you hard in the face. Its like jumping 
into an unheated swimming pool in the 
beginning of the summer, naked and 
drunk with a few close friends. You 
emerge from the water screaming and 
impossibly sober.
Its like putting down your copy of Slayers 
Divine Intervention and saying to yourself, 
What am I doing? This cant be the end of 
the line. And youd be right, and well on 
your way to discovering some of the most 
amazing, brutally honest, and insightful 
albums youve ever heard. One slight 
problem: the year isnt 1979, and Black 
Flag has long since disbanded, leaving 
behind only a comedic Henry Rollins.
Enter the punk rock narrative. Among the plethora of punk books, documen
taries, and poorly-acted films starring Matthew Lillard, stands a fresh, personal 
book by first-time author Aimee Cooper. Coloring Outside the Lines chronicles 
eighteen months of a young punks life on the West Coast, from her self-imposed 
induction into the LA punk scene, all the way through the personal breakups 
and growing pains, to her self-realization.
The book begins with the authors own epiphany: she realizes one sunny after
noon in Southern California that the Stones lead man Mick Jagger is a phony. 
When something like this happens only three pages into a book, its surely a sign 
of good things to come. Her search leads her to various locales on the West 
Coast, the renting of a communal punk house (similar to one that used to exist 
here in Oakland) and uncompromising, pissed-off music by bands such as The 
Germs, X, and Black Flag.
Where Coloring Outside the Lines really shines is not through a coherent story, 
but instead through Aimee Coopers frequent and concise reflections on the 
punk scene and life in general. These reflections are all too honest and at times 
even prophetic. Apparently the year 1980 also saw the punk scenes invasion by 
macho, ultra-violent punks. The author makes the clear distinction between 
people who were at a show for the music and those who were there to use the 
pit as an excuse for unbridled violence, something a bit too familiar these days.
Overall, Coloring Outside the Lines is deeply personal and intelligent. In this age 
of mall-punk and crap-rock, when good punk stories are hard to come by (many 
times, the members of the bands were too drunk to recall any of the events that 
defined their era), this book is a solid addition to the literature.

Short stories:
Author explores his own mental trauma though fiction
Eric Shapiros Short of a Picnic is a collection of vivid, striking short stories. Each 
is a portrait of someone with a mental illness. One has schizophrenia, another 
denies his attention deficit disorder, another has to fight his depression. The 
author has experience with mental illness in the form of his own obsessive com
pulsive disorder, which he struggled to control for years. Shapiro doesnt plead 
for sympathy or understanding; he simply and directly pulls you into experi
encing an unfamiliar psychological landscape.
The reader catches the characters confronting their illnesses through a web of 
their own confused thoughts. Narrations, diary entries, letters, and dialogues 
paint a picture of all that goes on inside the heads of crazy people. He is at his 
most descriptive in the story about a man who obsessively brushes his teeth. It 
is full of repetitive motions, but never boring. The fifth time he brushes his 
teeth, his gums were so happy they vibrated. The bristles moved well, bending 
and reaching and sweeping. After brushing his teeth, the man found the spool 
of floss. He flossed his teeth. The minted wire made hard love to his moist gums. 
His teeth were soaked with blood when he was through, but the man washed 
the blood away with a nice glass of milk.
Shapiro rounds out his characters and saves them from two-dimensionality by 
acknowledging their sexuality, their loneliness, the advent of their disease, 
their hope for a cure, or lack of it. One character, a woman with manic depres
sive tendencies, compares our brains to huge hotels that always reserve a sin
gle room (however tiny) for our right minds. Some people live there their whole 
lives. Others get lost on various floors. She continues, As for me, Ive toured 
the whole building lately. Thankfully, Ive always made it back to my safe room.
Short of a Picnic is a short 
read at 112 pages. If you have 
an interest in psychology or 
know someone with one of 
these illnesses, or if you sim
ply appreciate a good short 
story, this is a book for you to 
look into. It is not a systemat
ic study in psychology, but 
instead describes human sto
ries behind specific symp
toms and mental illnesses.

Project: Censored:
Opinions clash over this incendiary speech
Peter Phillips, director of Project: Censored, spoke to about fifty people scat
tered through McConomy Auditorium last Tuesday, the emptiness perhaps a 
testament to his critical and extreme leftist politics.
Since 1975, Project: Censored, has attempted to expose underreported and 
important news items. Phillips told his scant audience that the corporate 
media is controlling, in conjunction with the US government, the issues cov
ered in the free press.
Phillips was entertaining, if hard to follow. He made no attempt to divorce his 
politics from his project, much to the delight of the mostly active radicals in 
attendance of the lecture. Nor could he hide his disgust for a torpid America.
Hell tell you Condoleezza Rice gives orders to the New York Times, that the 
Republican right made sure that coverage of military action in Afghanistan 
was carefully scripted to downplay civilian casualties. Hes not trying to lie or 
mislead; he really believes.
Phillips has lost track of what makes a news story. His anger at an imperfect 
system has eroded his judgment of reality. Buried in all the Project: Censored 
rhetoric lie some important issues, further obfuscated by a project that tries 
to do just the opposite. Phillipss writings rake the muck.
Though the centrist majority will have trouble stomaching Phillipss proposi
tions served with politics, theres still room to read between the lines, to vote, 
and to question the center that seems so comfortably steady.
If theres something to take away from this lecture besides motivation, its an 
anecdote. Phillips told those gathered that a small number of people, just five 
or ten percent of the population, can affect change, for good or for bad. His 
illustration? The American Revolution.

Peter Phillips addressed a meager audience last Tuesday in McConomy.
Meet Pete Hamill:
The quintessential American newspaperman
Pete Hamill, a journalist for the New Yorker, will be lecturing in Pittsburgh today 
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall. He will talk about his most recent novel, Forever, 
as well as the history of journalism.
In the age of information overload, newspapers must be the medium that peo
ple believe. They dont have to be first. They can even be last. But they must be 
right, wrote Hamill in his book, News is a Verb (1998).
Through a newspaper, the reader gets more than a snap shot, a scrolling mar
quee, or a flash bulletin across the television screen. The reader gets a story, the 
emotions that the story carries, and the people who are affected by the events. 
Through eloquent phrasing, you get to hear their story.
Hamill began writing fiction novels in 1966 while at the New York Post; he said 
a fiction novel is nothing like a newspaper article. You are able to create details 
with one and not the other. [A novel is] a work of the imagination. You cant 
mix the two of them up.
Hamills first novel, The Killing for Christ, was a plot-driven suspense/thriller 
about an attempt to assassinate the Pope. His next novel, The Gift, was more 
personal, and focused on a period when television did not exist.
Imagination was fed by the radio, the dinner table, the street corner, and the 
library. The library became a crucial part of our lives. Television is essentially 
passive and reading is active. Kids see these images from the time theyre con
scious.
The Gift also focuses on New York history, including the citys immigrant popu
lation. Hamill feels that no one teaches the history behind current events any
more and people have a more apathetic world view.
People are getting half-informed information, said Hamill. Thats what cre
ates the casualness in things. [TV news] goes from a missing woman to bomb
ing Baghdad to ducks with cancer. Everything has the same weight. When you 
do one kind of reporting on television, you have no room for everything else.
Hamill said that his newest novel, Forever, was inspired by his turning sixty.
You realize youre not going to be able to read all the books and play the piano. 
And suddenly you say, Im out of time. That emotion was there [when I began 
writing the novel]. People wish that they could live forever.
Hamill finished the first draft of Forever on September 10, 2001; the events of 
September 11 forced him to rewrite the event in the perspective of his lead 
character, Cormac OConnor, an Irish blacksmith who resided in New York.
I had no intentions of ending the story with a calamity, said Hamill. I could
nt publish it the way it was. I had to go back, almost like a piece of music, note 
by note, chord by chord. I had to get rid of things. I wanted my story to have 
some manageable length and weight and hope that the reader would trust the 
momentum of the story. He had to make sure that Forever didnt sound like 
just research, but that there was a story that tied around it.
It was the hardest chunk of writing Ive ever done.

Messy art:
Its Not Just Mud! delights museumgoers
What is the oldest human art form? 
Music? Dance? Try pottery making. For 
almost 5,000 years, humankind has 
labored to shape clay, an otherwise 
humble and messy material, into a high 
art. The Its Not Just Mud! exhibit at 
the Carnegie Museum of Art includes a 
variety of exquisite clay artifacts, both 
ancient and modern. The items show 
an impressive breadth in ceramic art.
The exhibition is housed in the 
Museums Treasure Room, a small, 
wood-paneled niche. Even the oldest 
items, dating from ancient Egypt, show a great degree of detail and refinement, 
far from the crudeness usually associated with early pottery The Eye of Horus, 
a beautiful, deep blue Egyptian tile from the 26th Dynasty, is a perfect example 
of the sophistication of ancient ceramic masters.
A highlight of the collection is a group of remarkably well-preserved Greek 
vases, featuring complex patterns and lifelike figures. The exhibit also has a 
number of ancient Chinese artifacts. A massive, jade-green incense burner is a 
standout from the Han Dynasty. The vivid, almost startling, turquoise hue of a 
Ming Dynasty bowl is arguably the most eye-catching piece.
The exhibit showcases a number of fine porcelain pieces produced during the 
18th and 19th centuries, the period when fanciful dining sets began to appear 
in Europe. But clay was used for far more than making plates. Jars, cooking 
utensils, and even small statues were also fashioned out of clay.
A fine example is an 18th century 
rendition of the Pieta, the classical 
scene in which the Virgin Mary 
cradles the lifeless body of Jesus 
on her lap. The anguished face of 
the Virgin Mary as she reaches out 
her hand for help, the angel kiss
ing the hand of Jesus, and the 
remains of a battered cross in the 
background make it an especially 
moving sculpture.
Approaching the modern era, the 
designs become heavier and more 
symmetrical, veering away from 
the classical, highly ornamental style. A 1912 platter by Sonia Delaunay depicts 
a colorful arrangement of geometrical figures, its abstract design a precursor to 
Cubisms overlapping planes and angles. A large 1956 plaque on display was 
designed by none other than Picasso and features a cartoonish, crudely drawn 
face as its centerpiece.
The featured pieces are well chosen, and the quaint intimacy of the Treasure 
Room accentuates the offerings. Ultimately, Its Not Just Mud! is truly ambi
tious in its scope.

Video visions:
NOWN is a vibrant journey through animation and sound
The usual museum hush is conspicuously absent from Wood Street Galleries this 
weekend as the electronic music and flashing lights of NOWN fill the air. The 
exhibit showcases animation and technology in art, with media ranging from a 
DVD playback to cibachrome mounted on aluminum.
Robert Lazzarinis sculptures of a telephone, chair, and hammer seem low tech 
at first, but he used Photoshop and the 3D modeling program Maya to manipu
late the objects before he assembled the piece. The result is an eye-twisting mod
ification of usually banal objects.
Im basically applying two-dimensional distortions to three-dimensional 
objects, said Lazzarini. Im very much interested in the relationship between 
image and object.
Featured artist Michael Ross used similar methodology to forge his own hightech conglomeration. His piece includes two sculptures and one video, all of 
which feature the same image: four pairs of legs connected to a tubular body, 
reminiscent of a mutated Pillsbury doughboy.
The pieces are made in the 
computer; its a little like 
working with clay, but its 
not, said Ross. Im interest
ed in the sense of the 
strange.
Craig Kalpakjians Doors and 
Closet might also seem out of 
place until one realizes that 
the pieces were digitally ren
dered. More obviously digital 
images include Yael Kanareks 
beautifully barren Nowheres 
series, as well as images from 
the popular games Doom 
and Hexen by Miltos 
Manetas.
Matt Meurer/Photo Staff
Michael Ross's amorphous masterpiece.
The exhibit offers two installations for video game lovers: one showcases the 
nostalgic eight-bit Nintendo, complete with the orange Duck Hunt gun, and 
the other caters to Dance Dance Revolution with a familiar stomp pad.
Video works dominate. One piece, Willy Le Maitre and Eric Rosenveigs 
Diatoma, conveys a narrative in which the main character is a distortion on 
the screen. The artists have superimposed palindromes onto the film, which 
spell different words when viewed from either side of the screen.
[It] represents the ambiguity between expression and comprehension, said Le 
Maitre.
While casual museum patrons may not fully appreciate Le Maitres comment on 
expression, Rosss dancing doughboy mutant or the fully functional Nintendo 
will certainly entertain. NOWN, a vibrant journey through animation and 
sound, offers something for everyone.

More than just words:
CMU vocalist Christa Romanosky speaks through her songs
Christa Romanosky has been been musically inclined since she was young.
My mom had taught me the notes to the piano when I was little, and I took it 
from there. Since then, Christa has learned to play the saxophone, and has 
taught herself to play the guitar. Her bedroom was her sanctuary; she would 
lock herself up and write music for hours.
Christas musicality thrives at Carnegie Mellon. A first-year psychology and biol
ogy major, she has already performed at Skibo Coffeehouse three times. Her 
wish to become a forensic pathologist is just as strong as her goal to make her 
music known to the world.
I love the power of music. I love how music can take you outside your own body 
and set you down inside the passion and expression. You can get lost in music. 
It describes a feeling better than words ever could.
Her decision to attend Carnegie Mellon University was affected by the strong 
music program provided here. She was thoroughly pleased that she would have
the opportunity to change majors if she wanted. Christa was initially intimidat
ed by CMUs voice and theater majors; but she banished her nervousness at her 
first CMU performance, the first-year orientation talent show, reminding herself 
that it was a showcase, not a competition.
Christa still strives to overcome her shyness about live performance. She spent 
her summer at work, saving up for her guitar. Its her favorite possession, and 
shes wary of letting other people carry it because of its significance to her and 
her music.
As a songwriter and musician, Christa finds her muse in Jewel and Tori Amos.
Jewel was my biggest inspiration. She was proud of her crooked teeth and her 
body, and this was a time when I wasnt comfortable with myself. She wrote 
songs and poetry about important, expressive subjects. She wasnt just writing 
to rhyme.

Behind the scenes:
The actors steal the spotlight, but the techies make it shine
Elizabeth Buckser sits in her Introduction to Business Management class at noon 
on Thursday. This morning, she has been to the Art Store, done a critique for a 
class from nine to eleven, had an interview to become an RA, and squeezed in a 
fifteen-minute lunch break. She got six hours of sleep last night  a decent 
amount by her standards, considering she only slept for four hours the night 
before. Despite her hectic morning, Buckser is responsive and attentive in her 
class, not looking a bit tired. After the class she has to finish building a toolbox 
for her scenery stage craft class, paint a sign for Fridays Casino Night, and help 
set up the Activities Fair. At 4:30 pm, she will attend a lecture given by director 
Timothy Douglas in the Adamson Wing, then head directly to a practice for the 
Kiltie Band, in which she plays the clarinet and cymbals. After practice, shell eat 
dinner and work on various projects due for her classes on Friday and Tuesday. 
She is not expecting to come home until after midnight, most likely closer to two 
in the morning.
Im a really hard worker, says the first-year drama major. Its not whether or 
not I was prepared; its whether or not I have adjusted. [The program] expects a 
whole lot out of you.
And Buckser, whose drama interests lie in production and technical manage
ment, still appears to have made time for a social life. She is dating a fellow Kiltie, 
and has a policy to keep Friday nights and Saturdays free from work. She also 
seems to genuinely enjoy her courses. She likes that instead of having to sit 
through lectures, she gets to work with her hands and interact with her teachers 
and classmates.
To someone not familiar with CFA, it might seem that more emphasis is put on 
the acting majors than the production majors. After all, the actors are naturally 
placed in the spotlight. However, Buckser defies this assumption.
At Carnegie Mellon, a lot of focus is put on designers and production majors. 
Buckser explains that production majors are aware of their responsibility in pro
ductions. We are always told that if anything goes wrong [in a production], the 
stage manager is fired, she says and smiles.
Buckser decided to study technical theater in her junior year in high school, 
when she stage-managed her first show, Grease. Even though she believes that 
backstage it was probably the worst show in the world, it made her realize what 
she wanted to do in life.
When asked what she plans to do after college, Buckser delivers a fast and 
confident answer: she hopes to work in live theater for five or six years right after 
college, and then move into film and go back to Orange County, California, 
where her family lives. After film, she wants to work in television, hopefully for 
Disney.
Buckser is applying for an internship with Sony Entertainment and Disney this 
summer to gain more experience on her field. But while reaching for these 
dreams, she maintains a realistic outlook on life. Despite her passion, she 
acknowledges that jobs in her field are limited. She says that after every semes
ter, production majors are forced to ask themselves whether or not they have 
made the right decision in picking their major. But Buckser cant see herself 
doing anything else.

TartanTRAK makes it easy to find a run-of-the-mill campus job: work behind a desk in 
Morewood Gardens, in the UC, or in Hunt Library Those who prefer to work off-campus 
could make lattes at Starbucks, fold shirts at Banana Republic, or shelve books at Barnes 
and Noble. Some Carnegie Mellon students, however, have discovered more appealing 
ways to make money.
Brian Levinthals official job title is Research Assistant, but Brian, a senior psy
chology major, prefers to call himself a gerbil tender. Twice a week, he works 
in a lab on the fourth floor of Baker Hall, making sure the gerbils stay healthy. 
Healthy gerbils typically have smooth, fluffy coats, Brian says. When they get 
upset, their hair stands on end. They get all mussed up and disheveled looking. 
Also, they will kind of look like theyve been crying.
All sorts of things can make the gerbils unhappy, but usually its because a water 
bottle has leaked and soaked their cage, or because they got caught on their 
exercise wheel.
In our lab there are two sets of gerbils: half are named after Simpsons charac
ters and half are named after Starbucks drinks, Brian says. Ive always found 
that the Starbucks gerbils are a bit more jittery, but it might just be me.
Each gerbil gets a clean cage each week, and while theyre out of their cages, 
Brian weighs each one to make sure its at an appropriate weight (70-100 
grams). He feeds and then bathes them. Its not like a typical water bath, 
Brian says. Gerbils are from desert areas so theyre used to rolling around in the 
sand. They shake around in it to get gunk out of their fur. So we pick them up 
and put them in a special dust cage where they run around in tubes and have a 
ball. If they dont seem to want to take their bath, usually well just toss some of 
the dust on them. Tough love.

Lisa Auslnder, a junior psychology and philosophy double major, manages the 
CMU mens basketball team. She videotapes games and practices, keeps the 
stats during games, and runs the clock for drills during practice.
[The mens team] had an opening and the womens teams managers were 
already hired, says Lisa. Besides that, Id much rather watch the men run 
around.

SOME SHADY 
BUSINESS.
Bradford Yankiver/Photo Editor
Ophir Tanz runs his web hosting business out of his Squirrel Hill apartment.
Ophir Tanz, junior information systems and human computer interaction double major, started 
his own web and print design company when he was just 15 years old. After he got paid to build 
a successful website for a friends uncle, he realized the vast moneymaking potential and used 
the money he made to start Fluidesign.com. With little overhead, Ophir and a partner worked 
from home until their client base demanded greater resources.
Less than three years later, Fluidesign moved into an office in Santa Monica, California. One 
full-time and one part-time designer were hired, and alliances were formed with various busi
nesses in the Los Angeles area (e.g. printers and programming companies). Ophir and his part
ner focused on sales, business development, technical support, and programming, as well as 
general management of the company. Fluidesign was sold for a substantial amount of money 
shortly before Ophir came to CMU, and according to Ophir, it is still thriving.
A year and a half ago, Ophir launched Fluidata.com, a web hosting and solutions site, using 
money from the sale of Fluidesign and other investors. He is in charge of sales, technical sup
port, reseller training, and server administration.
Ophir admits that it is a big responsibility and his grades have no doubt suffered as a result. 
However, the way he constructs the websites allows his clients to do most of the updating with
out ever having to contact him.
The majority of processes are automatic and end-user maintained, he explains. An example 
of this is the control panel we offer our hosting clients. The control panel enables them to make 
changes or updates to their account such as adding e-mail accounts and changing user quotas 
without ever having to contact us.
Still, he handles most of the communication with the clients and says, Youre often dealing 
with people that have little or no technical expertise whatsoever. To them, most situations are 
black and white: Either a system is up and working properly, or it isnt.
It might be a lot for a student to handle, but Ophir says that the rewards make it all worth it. He 
enjoys what it takes to run a company and likes having something to direct his creativity toward.
Naturally, there are the students who are so desperate 
for money they resort to illegal dealings. Or perhaps they 
just like the thrill of it.
The two most common and time-honored ways to make 
money illegally on a college campus are dealing drugs 
and making fake IDs. If you have friends between the 
ages of 18 and 21, you probably know someone who 
does one of the above.
No drug dealers would grant an interview, but one brave 
soul provided the lowdown on making fake IDs. The 
informant insists that he is merely the middleman in the 
transaction between client and faker.
"I usually just kept an open ear at first. If somebody 
mentioned they needed [a fake ID], I just chimed in and 
said,I know a guy. After a while the word just spread 
and people started coming to me." The guy who makes 
the fake IDs charges between $35 and $80 depending 
on how well he knows and/or likes the person request
ing the ID. The middleman makes about 15 percent on 
each ID. If the client was buying the ID for $35, 
Middleman made only $5.
Well, its not exactly hard work being middleman, he 
says. On the other hand, $15 is pretty decent for pass
ing on a small card. The ID-maker has templates of 
Maryland and Maine license plates on his computer and 
the card is made from easy-to-find items like lamination 
from an office store and hologram paper from a party 
store.
Does he ever get complaints that the fake IDs dont 
work? "Not big complaints, the middleman says. 
Sometimes the lamination would peel a bit, but I just 
told them to try some super glue, and usually theyre 
satisfied."

OUTOFTHE 
GOODNESS OF 
HER HEART.
Believe it or not, there are some CMU students who actually 
work for free. Volunteering takes a special kind of person  a 
person who isnt in desperate need of money (or who can find 
the time to work for pay-as well as volunteer), a person with a 
passion for a cause, and a person who doesnt watch the clock 
tick and repeatedly calculate how many seconds of work are 
remaining.
Stephanie Hepner tutors at-risk children through the East End 
Youth Project, a program originally organized through CMU's 
now defunct Center for University Outreach. A senior Russian 
Studies and International Relations double major, Stephanie 
became the secretary of the EEYP at the end of her freshman 
year, and last January became the president. She tutors for two 
hours per week in a variety of disciplines.
"Ive tutored German to elementary and high school students. 
Ive tutored English as a second language to a Swiss fifth-grad
er. I tutored remedial English to middle school kids and last 
semester I taught two fifth graders the basics of how to play the 
French horn, which Im continuing this semester.
Two hours per week might not seem like much, but as an offi
cer, Stephanie dedicates a lot of time to EEYP. A new policy 
enacted by the Pittsburgh Board of Education requiring every 
volunteer in the Pittsburgh Public Schools to have child abuse 
clearance  there are two forms that cost $10 each  posed 
quite a challenge.
"It was a pretty stressful time, Stephanie says, "trying to 
organize a relatively simple and efficient way to get all the tutors 
cleared, while not losing tutors. We also tried to find alternate 
sources of funding for the $20 per tutor.
"I believe in giving back to the community and becoming part 
of the community in which I live, Stephanie says, "even if its 
just for four years while Im at college. She also enjoys the bal
ance that spending time around children provides.
"The kids keep me sane, they ask me questions, they become 
my friends, I develop a mentoring relationship with them. They 
keep thihgs real.
Furthermore, Stephanies mother, who was once a teacher in the 
ghetto of Gary, Indiana, has taught her the importance of help
ing children who may be more disadvantaged than she. Given 
an equal chance, kids will succeed equally well.... And one last 
thing: I do it because I love the kids.
John Kim, a junior art and human computer interaction double major, is a gallery 
greeter for the Panopticon exhibition at the Carnegie Museum of Art. He hands out 
guides and audio devices for about five hours per day, twice a week.
John calls it a no brainer job, but he gets a nice hourly wage, as well as a 15 per
cent discount at the museum store.
This job has forced me to become extra friendly and enthusiastic, John says. Even 
when Im in a not-so-great mood, or the visitor looks a bit creepy, I still have to smile 
and explain to them every single little detail [about] how to use the audio devices 
and what the gallery guide is for.
He heard about the job through a friend who had worked at the museum during the 
summer, and it sounded appealing to him because he knew he would be surround
ed by beautiful art. But John has yet to actually view Panopticon for himself. It 
reminds me of work too much.
Sometimes we hide our ID badges and give each other different names such as 
Frodo or Sonata and call each other by them in front of visitors. Or we speak in a 
British accent just to scare the visitors who look like natives of Pittsburgh.
He and his co-workers also have contests to see who can pass out the most audio 
devices. John has befriended the other gallery greeters  students from other 
Pittsburgh universities  as well as some of the guards.
Harry always passes out candy to an unsuspecting gallery greeter on the verge of 
boredom. And the fact that the guards tend to be a few decades older than us does
nt really matter. Sometimes they have really interesting stuff to say about the art, 
since they walk around the exhibit all day.
Alyson Pope, a junior in professional writing, is a cocktail waitress in the club 
lounge at the University of Pittsburghs new Peterson Events Center. She found the 
job through her boyfriend, a student at Pitt, who works in Petersons catering 
department.
While Alyson doesnt get up close and personal with any of the basketball players, 
she gets to mingle with some other fine athletes: Steelers Jerome Bettis, Plexico 
Burress, and Mike Logan, and former Steeler Edmund Nelson who hosts the fifth 
quarter show after every game on WNPA, Pittsburghs UPN affiliate.
During the basketball season, Alyson shows up two hours before every home game 
(because the rich and famous like to pre-party as much as anyone), and stays an 
hour after the game ends to clean up. Home games are once or twice a week, and 
at about seven hours per day, Alyson makes a pretty penny from her hourly wage 
and hefty tips.
Sharin Apostolou, a junior voice major, makes her spending cash by singing in the 
choir at the Church of the Ascension across the street from Cathedral Mansions  
the only catch is shes Jewish.
I wear my Star [of David] all the time, Sharin says, and though her religious faith 
did not come up during her interview, everyone got the hint. I was their Hebrew 
coach when they wanted to do pieces in Hebrew.... They assumed that I wouldnt 
want to do the Psalm cantoring, but Im still their alto soloist.
Sharin has no problem participating in services outside of her faith because she is 
doing what she loves to do. What better way to make money? she asks.

Food and Family:
The kitchen is where the heart is
Last week my brother, at 28, went off to his first war. As a sergeant in the United 
States Army, he is one of thousands who are at this very moment being mobi
lized for a war in the Middle East. Iraq. As a target in the current round of mar
tial plans, it was the topic most frequently discussed in our household right up 
until my brother got the call from his western Connecticut reservist center.
When the date was finally decided, the situation lacked the kind of theatricality 
my film-watching experience had so thoroughly prepared me for: no ticker-tape 
parades, emotional outbursts, or girlfriends with windblown locks frantically 
trying to catch one last glimpse of her beau as he sails or flies or drives off for 
duty, honor and country. My family reacted reflexively, the way it does to a 
funeral notice or an impending pregnancy; it made dinner.
The snow in New York the evening before my brother left was thick and envelop
ing. It was the kind of snow, halfway to a blizzard, which makes it almost impos
sible to see anyone until you come within a few feet of them, so suddenly in fact 
that in this kind of snow everyone is a stranger. My mother, who was her usual 
prolific self, was preparing the pasta, sauce, and meat that is habit for Sundays 
around our house. She started with a fresh tomato sauce, hours ahead of time, 
spiked with garlic and rosemary and a splash of Marsala to thicken it.
My brothers and I grew up on this kind of TLC, and my mother didnt intend to 
break tradition just before her middle child departed indefinitely. The meal per
fectly fitted the situation and vice versa. My family and I were able pass in and 
out of the kitchen, chatting idly while someone took turns stirring the sputter
ing pot! My father had brought the meat, as always, from one of the many fami
ly butchers dotting the Bronxs Arthur Avenue. These are the types of store front 
establishments that declare their superiority in blood and guts; from the avenue 
my brothers and I could take long walks, at every corner greeted by Bronxs 
Best! and Classico Italian cuisine splayed out on meat hooks and swinging in 
the cacophonous butcher shop air.
Later on, when we finally ate, the atmosphere never seemed to shift from its pre
dictable normality. I kept on waiting for my mother to break down at some point 
and beg my father to spirit him away to Canada, Mexico, or lower Westchester. 
Instead, she was the picture of composure and stability. All this, whats more, 
while she probably had nightmarish visions of my brother fighting some frigid 
desert night, wrapped in sheepskin, and gnawing feebly on a few spare turnips. 
But still we ate and laughed and talked. I retrieved a Chianti from our basement 
and returned 20 minutes later to add a 1998 Medoc to the table. The wine 
always went well with the robust, flavorful pasta sauce my mother excelled at, 
and this evening was no different. Some crusty peasant bread, faintly smoky, 
sopped up any leftover sauce and dulled slightly the tannins in the wine.
The next morning my brother was picked up in front of the house. We were all 
very grateful for one more night together around the table. As the jeep rattled 
down our block, my brother ensconced within it, I caught myself forgetting to 
wave. I knew my family would forgive me. We had, in our own way, already said 
goodbye.

duckbar
Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
A duck is a wonderful creature. How wonderful is a duck? As an answer, 
allow me to start with the evolution of the duck.
Approximately 450 million years ago, animal life on O 
earth only existed in the oceans. The primordial 
soup, if you will. Life forms were small and had not 
yet evolved into fish. Common animals such as 
trilobytes and trilobits ruled the sea, traveling in groups called "gangs." The 
other organisms in the sea feared the trilogangs. Eventually, a primitive form 
of fish evolved whose gills were actually able to adapt to the harsh atmosphere 
and environment of land. This fish, fearing the threat of the trilogangs, 
flopped itself onto the shores and lay there, becoming stronger in the air. It 
ate primitive breadcrumbs. About two weeks later, it evolved into ducks. 
Twelve of them.

Anything But Asleep:
Sleeper heralds in a new breed of badass
First off, Sleeper isnt your grandpappys crime story. Did Humphrey Bogart chill at a superhero bar after a 
days hard work of breaking and entering? Did James Cagney hang out with a guy named Genocide? Did 
Frank Sinatra rough up whoever he wanted and frequent strip clubs? Ok, maybe ... but the point is still clear.
Dont misunderstand Sleepers hero. Holden Carver is a sensitive guy. In his better moments, hes reminiscent 
of Guy Pearce in Memento, and he bares a striking resemblance to Steve McQueens roughneck cop Frank 
Bullitt. But this man is no cop, and certainly not sensitive enough to stop from killing people. At least not yet. 
But Sleeper hints at imminent change. Holden feels like something in his life is out of place.
Written by Ed Brubaker (Batman), with Sean Phillips (UncannyX-Men) on the art chores, Sleeper sees greater 
success for both of its creators than their previous projects. Brubaker lays down a rhythmic story, pacing just 
right for an even combination of frantic page turns and moments to regroup. With less superhero business 
and more crime-based action, Phillipss dramatic angles and heavy inks are more at home.
There are no gimmicks attached. This story delivers what the cover says: broken glass and bullet holes. 
Holden even has a strikingly original super power  and you can find out what it is for just $2.95 and a trip 
to your comic book shop.

PILLBOX. 27 JANUARY 2003.-
HOROSCOPES.
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Next Thursday you will be robbed 
of your lunch money and given a Wet Willy by a very intimidat
ing Pitt student. Fortunately, she will not be armed, just aggres
sive and bigger than you.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): You wont realize that youve been 
sitting in the wrong class until the end of the semester when you 
discover that you still cant differentiate but are fluent in Russian 
at a third grade level.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): You will soon 
become upset over the inability of your expen
sive hair care products to control frizz in the 
unpredictable Pittsburgh weather.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Amazons mag
ical ability to gauge your interests and desires 
perfectly based on previous purchases will 
continue to amaze you.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Others will 
remain unconvinced of your theory that 
this severe winter is the wrath of hundreds 
of angry Pittsburgh ghosts killed in mining 
accidents and ready to give Carnegie a 
piece of their minds.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): You will soon find that 
doing drugs is not the answer to questions #1, #3, #4, #7 and 
#9, causing you to fail the exam and start drinking unhealthy 
amounts of questionable beverages.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): 
Learning to speak Elvish will not make Liv 
Tyler fall in love with you.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): 
Your television demographic welcomes you 
with open arms and the seductive power of 
American Idol II.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Campus Police 
will threaten to impound your pet goat until you tell them its just 
your drama student roommate acting like a goat. They will be 
too confused and disturbed to inquire further.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Your attempt to show 
support for your team this Super Bowl will be horribly misun
derstood when your fellow engineering students, looking per
plexed and embarrassed, ask if the jersey is a form of tradition
al dress from your country, forgetting youre from Pittsburgh.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Your Middle Eastern 
Conflicts professor will finally appreciate your thoughtfulness 
and intelligence when you successfully mask your ignorance of 
international affairs with a look of pensive concern and openended questions.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You will experience a short 
period of depression when you learn that your bachelors degree 
will only help you get your fall-back job. This will be followed by
45 years of numbly accepting your monotonous existence and 
the small joys of your mediocre health plan.
