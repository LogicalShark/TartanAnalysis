The Tech varsity lost to the Lehigh 
University football team in a hotly 
contested exhibition on Thanksgiving 
Day afternoon, before the largest 
crowd that ever witnessed a foot
ball game in the Pittsburg district. 
It was Techs debut as the exponent 
of free athletic contests and every 
feature was so encouraging that the 
non-commercial policy will doubtless 
be continued.
The day was an ideal one for foot
ball, although bad weather had been 
predicted. Both teams had been prim
ed for the contest and enthusiasts got 
what they had long anticipated; a live
ly and exciting exhibition. Long be
fore 2.30 P. M., the scheduled time for 
the kickoff, large crowds began to 
wend their way across the Schenley 
Park bridge to the oval. By the 
time the umpire had blown his 
whistle for the beginning of the game, 
every available seat and point of 
vantage had been taken, and still a 
steady stream of humanity poured into 
the park. By conservative judges it 
has been estimated that twenty-five 
thousand people witnessed the game. 
Not an unimportant and pleasing fea
ture of the assemblage, was the large 
number of ladies whose presence al
ways insure an orderly gathering.
THE GAME.
First Half.
Tech kicked off at 2.30, Brown boot

Just as an example of the strictness 
of athletic rules, the Princeton regula
tion as to competitions in the same 
season may be cited. A man may not 
be a member of more than two or
ganizations which represent the uni
versity in any one season. For in
stance, if he i on the glee club and 
the dramatic club, he cannot take part 
in varsity sports at all. Once upon a 
time a man mignt be all kinds of an 
athlete. He could play football, base
ball, hockey and be a track athlete, 
but not now'.
Photographing Drawings.
Photographing drawings to a greatly 
reduced scale, for the purpose of rec
ord, or even for use in the shop, is 
coming to be quite common practice 
in the larger manufacturing plants. 
The Schenectady works of the Ameri
can Locomotive Company follows this 
practice extensively for card records, 
and has a room in the engineering 
building specially fitted for the pur
pose. The standard size tracings of 
locomotive erecting cards are about 
25x66 inches, and these are reduced to 
Si/i inches length, a OVkxS^-inch plate 
camera being used. One plate is large 
enough for the reductions of two trac
ings, so, for example, the side eleva
tion and cross-sections, or any other 
combination of two tracings desired, 
may be photographed on the same 
plate.
The tracings are photographed by 
transmitted light, as experience has 
demonstrated that the results are more 
uniform and generally satisfactory 
than when photograpned by reflected 
light. North light is used, a large 
window facing the north having been 
provided. The window is double, 
there being two y. frames, each carry
ing a pane about 4x11 feet. The frame 
carrying the inner pane is swung on 
hinges at one end, and a circular track 
and trolley supports the opposite end,' 
this being necessary because of the 
great weight and length of the frame 
and pane. Both panes are mounted 
flush in their frames, facing each 
other, so that when the swinging 
frame is closed upon the stationary 
frame, the panes are closely pressed 
together.
The tracings are mounted on the 
outer pane by stickers at the corners, 
and then the inner frame is closed 
upon it, thereby pressing the tracing 
down flat, holding it firmly and with
out wrinkles. The large size of the 
window permits four standard trac
ings to be moupted at once. These 
may be the locomotive side elevation, 
and cross-sections, and the boiler side 
elevation, and cross-sections, thus com
pressing on two comparatively small 
plates all the general data of a locomo
tive not carried on the specification

Junior Dance.
The dance given by the Juniors on 
Tuesday was a great success. The 
girls who decorated the dancing hall 
and the halls deserve great credit for 
the effect was very pretty.
The music and floor were splendid, 
and the dancing never flagged a 
moment.
There were about seventy-five pres
ent and all said they had a lovely 
time. The girls looked very pretty in 
their light dresses.
We all would have been glad if the 
evening had been longer.
The Lehigh-Tech game on Thursday 
was well attended by the M. M. C. S. 
girls. We would have come home 
feeling gay at heart if Tech had won; 
but the plucky play of the home team 
was thoroughly appreciated.
Miss Helen Oursler of the class of
1910 is very ill with typhoid fever, we 
hear. We all hope she may have a 
speedy recovery, and be with us again 
very soon.

One day a young lady named Yohe,
The study hall peace did destroy,
She laughed and she talked.
And round the room walked.
We all hope this will settle Miss 
Yohe.

And she is gone.
A blush, a curl, another girl,
And life goes on.

From Philadelphia Inquirer.
Pittsburg, Nov. 24 (Special)Car
negie Tech schools may be barred 
from all future athletic relations with 
the smaller colleges because of the 
stand taken on the gate receipts in 
football, and the free game with Le
high, which has been arranged for 
Thanksgiving Day has caused the ath
letic management of W. U. P. to be
come indignant. On this day W. U. 
P. has always played the State College 
team and it has always drawn great 
crowds. The W. U. P. men look upon 
the step taken by Carnegie Tech as a 
direct affront. It has been decided to 
cover all relations with Tech in the 
future.
W. U. P. claims that Tech is playing 
to a certain millionaire alumnus of 
Lehigh in the expectation of getting a 
good sized donation. It is said that 
a number of the small colleges in this 
section of the state will follow W. U. 
P.s action in barring Tech.
The Carnegie schools are primarily 
intended for the sons of mechanics and 
young men that make their own way. 
The students, however, maintain auto
mobiles, for at a discussion of ways 
and means, as to entertaining the Le
high team, it was stated that if auto
mobile could be obtained, a trip 
about the city would be the proper 
thing. Forty poor students in the 
classroom immediately offered their in
dividual automobiles and their ser
vices as drivers of the machines.

THE TARTAN7
A Busy Week.
The week iust ended has been one 
of the busiest in the history of the 
Tech Schools, excepting possibly 
Founders Week, last April.
The Lehigh team did not arrive on 
schedule time last Wednesday owing 
to a bad wreck which held the train 
for nearly three hours and a half. 
They were met at East Liberty by 
Manager Thompson and were convey
ed direct to the Hotel Schenley in 
automobiles loaned by friends of the 
school. In the afternoon they were 
escorted through the buildings by the 
Director and the officers, and were ap
parently much pleased with what they 
saw. Our shops seemed to be the 
main points of interest and the Le
high men were impressed with the im
portance given this branch of en
gineering education at Tech. Of 
course, all the students who could, 
sized them up, and much talk was 
started as to their size and weight.
The smoker at the University Club 
in the evening was well attended. 
The Glee Club was out in force and 
entertained all evening with songs. 
The food served to the two teams 
was strictly in acc-rdance with the 
best training and smoking by players 
was forbidden.
At 9.15 the same evening a mass 
meeting of the night students was held 
in the assembly room. Mr. L. B. Weidlein of the day Juniors made a stirring 
address and urged the night men to 
show their school spirit. A fund 
amounting to about eighty dollars was 
collected from the night students, the 
most of which came from those pres
ent at this meeting, for the purpose 
of hiring a band to lead the rooters on 
Thursday afternoon. Too much can 
not be said in behalf of the night 
students for the liberal manner in 
which they contributed, and during 
the present tight money scare, too.
Thursday morning dawned cloudy 
and with a fierce wind blowing so that 
indications seemed to point towards 
rain. The hopes of the Tech bunch 
accordingly went down, but by noon 
the sky had cleared and the day gave 
promise of being a good one.
At about one oclock the rooters be
gan to assemble at the buildings, and 
Joe Thompson gave the players a 
heart to heart talk lasting about one 
half hour in one of the class rooms
of the school. By 1:40 the band had 
arrived and the start was made for 
the oval with about two hundred root
ers in line.
Temporary bleachers had been 
erected on the south side of the field 
the afternoon before by the Plebe 
class under the direction of Mr. Reed, 
and the Park guards were holding 
these for the Tech rooters, so that no 
trouble was experienced when the pro
cession arrived on the field. The root
ers seemed to be much impressed with 
the great and steadily increasing 
crowd. The great grandstand was 
crowded fifteen minutes before the 
kick-off, and people were standing 
against the ropes which had been 
stretched about ten feet from the 
side lines. A small but loyal bunch 
of Lehigh supporters made themselves 
heard from the west end of the grand 
stand.
By the time the game started at 2.31 
every available inch of space was oc
cupied, and the crowd was* enormous 
in size, and noisy in its support of 
Tech. Some of the newspaper men 
estimated the number of people pres
ent at between fifteen and twenty 
thousand.
During the first half the rooting was 
fast and furious and the fact that Le
high crossed Techs goal line three 
times seemed to make no difference in 
the spirit of the Tech men. Between 
the halves an extemporaneous sere
nade of yells for Lehigh and Tech was 
made to the grand stand.
During the second half the people 
seemed to be impatient because Tech 
was not getting the better of the argu
ment, and they crowded on the field 
in spite of the officers protests. The 
rooters took heart when they saw that 
Tech had taken a brace and the yells 
rang out fast and loud.
At the close of the game the great 
crowd streamed down to the cars on 
foot, in wagons, and in automobiles.
In the evening dinner was served to 
both teams at the Schenley Hotel.
By eight oclock those who were 
lucky enough to' have seats, and many 
who were not, had made their appear
ance at the Grand prepared for a good 
time. Many of the officers of the 
school and the faculty occupied seats 
with the Tech men, and there were 
also a few Lehigh men sprinkled here 
and there in the audience. The lower 
boxes were decorated in Lehigh and

Some Lehigh men succeeded in get. ting the fun started and the theater 
resounded all the evening with Tech, 
Lehigh, Wup and State yells. The 
men also joined in the chorus of some 
of the songs sung on the stage, and 
were not slow in showing their ap
proval of the acts in a noisy manner.
The eventful day closed with the 
departure of Lehigh for the train 
which most of them missed.

A Review.
The close of the second football sea
son brings Carnegie Tech face to face 
with the athletic situation. A season 
that seemed to hold out such promise, 
but failed to return more than a 
modicum of success certainly furnish
es food for reflection. At such a time 
it is up to the student body to analyze 
the situation carefully and seek a 
remedy.
To understand the situation the en
tire matter of our athletic relations 
must be reviewed. Our athletic affairs 
have not been managed with any 
deliberate plan or system; but rather 
have been the resultant of a queer ad
mixture of student and faculty con
trol together with a large dash of no 
control at all; under this condition of 
affairs it has been necassary in order 
to keep athletics alive for those stu
dents and members of the faculty who 
had these matters closely at heart to 
proceed on their own initiative. Hence
in many cases mistakes have been 
made that might have been avoided had 
there been a student governing board 
backed by an interested student body. 
Such being the case, the student body 
should take steps to rectify its own 
sins of omission rather than censure 
those of commission of its various 
athletic managers and captains.
Now is the time to study the mis
takes of the past football season with 
a view not of censuring those who 
have made mistakes but rather of 
guarding against their repetition. 
When looking over the season and in
quiring reasons for the teams lack of 
success, we are at loss for any single 
explaining factor. The fact that the 
team showed such remarkable fight
ing spirit at times in direct contrast to 
listless and seemingly dumb play at 
others, does not admit of any simple 
explanation. The team composed of 
players that in individual ability com
pared favorably with any of their op
ponents went down to defeat in its 
first game. Whether this defeat, at 
the hands of an underestimated foe 
was due to over confidence entirely, 
we do not undertake to say; but the 
fact that the same team held a vastly 
superior opponent to the same score, 
goes to show that such was the.case. 
The games with Westminster and 
Allegheny again brought forth the dis
jointed play that characterized the 
first game. Not until the Case game 
did the team again show the true in
domitable fighting spirit that marked 
its game with W. U. P. Here we have 
the facts that marked our team as, 
what is known in racing parlance as 
an in and outer.
The underlying reason for these 
seemingly inconsistent performances 
can not be determined off hand, only 
the results can be noted. The varying 
interest of some of the members of the 
team cannot be attributed to either 
the men themselves or their coach 
or captain with entire certainty. We 
know that the large majority of the 
students has the teams interest at 
heart and is loyally supporting it. Let 
us get together then, and arrange our 
schedule for next year and make our 
arrangements for coaching, not knock
ing the mistakes of this year but 
realizing that if they are repeated it 
will be the fault of the entire student 
body.
Grand Beauty Contest.
The Tartan announces that, begin
ning with the current issue a coupon 
will be printed which is to be cut out 
and handed to Mr. Wm. Chancellor of 
the Junior Chemicals with the name 
of the male student who in the voters 
judgment is the handsomest in the 
Carnegie Technical School. An up
right piano, which will be on exhibition 
in Mr. Parsons office, will be presented 
to the winner. The contest will close 
at 12 noon, December 20th, 1907. The 
standing of candidates will be publish
ed weekly.
The Athletic Association have taken 
the matter of awarding letters to Caldren and Williams under advisement 
and probably will have reported by the 
time this edition reaches the student 
body. Neither Caldren nor Williams 
played in five games, which is the re
quirement established by the Associa
tion, but the character of the work 
these men have done is deserving of 
consideration.
The construction of a large blast fur
nace has been accomplished in five 
months at the South Buffalo yards of 
the Lackawanna Steel Co. It is 91% 
feet high and 22 feet in diameter at 
the bosh. In addition to the furnace 
the work involved the building of a 
boiler house, the installation of ten 400 
h.-p. Stirling boilers and the laying of 
2,200 feet of new water mains. No 
serious delays were experienced in 
machinery deliveries and much of the 
metal work was done in the companys 
shops.

A boat-loading pier is used at Almeria, Spain, by the Alquife Mines & 
Railway Co., which has a total storage 
capacity of 10,000 tons of ore. It is 
a framed steel structure 360 feet long, 
62 feet high above the water level and 
54 feet wide. On the top are four 
parallel railroad tracks, each of which 
will accommodate twenty hopperbottomed steel cars of 15 tons ca
pacity. Under the tracks are two 
lines of hoppers, twenty hoppers on 
each side of the pier, each of which 
holds 250 tons when full. The ma
terial in the hoppers is discharged 
through chutes into vessels alongside 
the pier.

Weidlein, of the Day School, and 
Stamm, of the Night School, are a pair 
of good beggars; they raised a nice 
little sum for the band and in such a 
way that nobody felt badly over walk

The night men who refused to at
tend the mass meeting last Wednesday 
because they did not like to be driven 
into the lecture room, were seen at 
the game. They were decent enough 
to root for Tech.
The Night School would like to 
know how the Athletic Association is 
going to be formed, or if formed how 
they are to be represented.
In the game Thursday morning 1911 
showed a more diversified form of at
tack while twelve excelled in punts.
If 1912 had been awake they might 
have made a touchdown instead of a 
safety, but if 1911 had not been badly 
rattled there would not.have been any 
score.
Davis try for a field goal was a 
beauty from the 25-yard line and lack
ed but a few inches of clearing the 
bar. 1912s attempt was part of the 
comedy as he punted it over the bar 
from the same point.
The second annual smoker of the 
class of 1911 is being arranged and 
from what has been given out for pub
lication there is going to be a good 
time in it for all who attend. The 
program will be confined to school 
talent only as the price charged will
be too low to permit of the hiring of 
outside talent. The main feature of 
the entertainment will be the serving 
of refreshments and smokes, with such 
side attractionsas an interclass de

There is a rumor afloat among the 
night students to the effect that a fra

which is more beneficial than the 
brotherly spirit kindled and maintain

Walter Yenny, of 1911, was hurt in 
the 1912-ll game but did not know it 
until after the contest was over. His 
ankle was very badly wrenched but 
he gamely kept his place throughout. 
He was missed at the theater by his 
mates in the box party. Mr. Yenny is 
the man who saved the day at the 
night mass meeting by putting in a 
clearing house certificate after the hat 
had robbed him of his loose change. 
We are proud of Walter!
The masquerade idea was abandon

Compressed Gas as an Insulator.
Last year Prof. Ryan read a paper 
before the American Institute of Elec.trical Engineers upon the voltage re
quired to produce the electric corona 
around wires in air. In that paper it 
was shown, as indeed the researches 
of several laboratories had already in
dicated, that the rupturing voltage of 
a given gas layer increased with the 
pressure of the gas. In later measure
ments upon the breaking voltage of 
air under high pressure, using an airgap of a few millimetres between 
needle points, it appeared that the 
breaking voltage increased steadily 
with the pressure until in the neigh
borhood of twelve atmospheres, when 
the curve of voltages with respect to 
pressure bent out of shape in a most 
erratic way. This peculiarity mani
fested itself not only with air, but also 
with other gases. The source of the 
discrepancy was finally traced to the 
spark-gap structure, which was not 
sufficiently large and remote from the 
electrodes to leave the course of the 
dielectric stress undisturbed. When 
the structure was altered with this 
phenomenon in view, and thin alumninum rods with rounded ends substitut
ed for needle-points, uniform results 
were obtained, giving smooth platted 
curves. A report of the later investi
gations of Prof. Ryan is contained in 
a recent issue of The Electric Journal, 
as has been mentioned in these 
columns.
With an air-gap of approximately 25 
millimetres or 0.1 inch, the rupturing 
voltage was about 12.5 kilovolts at 
normal pressure, or 1 atmosphere, and 
70 kilovolts at 14 atmospheres, follow
ing a straight-line law between these 
two conditions. Above 14 atmospheres 
the effect of increasing pressure be
comes markedly reduced, causing the 
curve to flatten, until at 50 atmo
spheres it would appear that the rup
turing voltage of 111 kilovolts became 
substantially constant, or was not sus
ceptible of being further increased by 
increase of pressure. Whether this 
flattening of the curve is again due to 
local disturbance in electric flux, or 
whether it represents a physical limit, 
it is at present impossible to say with 
certainty. The results show, however, 
that the dielectric strength of the par
ticular air-gap used was increased 
nearly six times by increasing the airpressure fourteen times. At normal 
pressure, or 1 atmosphere, the ruptur
ing electric intensity was apparently 5 
kilovolts per millimetre, and at 14 
atmospheres it increased to 28 kilo
volts per millimetre. Consequently 
the apparent electric strength of the 
air was raised to that of the strong
est rubber insulator, by increasing the 
air-pressure of 14 atmospheres. There 
does not seem to be much difference 
between the dilectric strength of 
oxygen, air, nitrogen, or carbonic acid 
at high pressures, although they are 
stated to increase by about 18 per 
cent in all, in the order named. Hydro
gen, however, is distinctly weaker. It 
is hardly likely, therefore, that any of 
these gases would be substituted for 
air in attempting to secure high in
sulation. The advantage to be gained 
by the substitution would hardly war
rant the trouble of the chemical ap
paratus.
parison with gaseous air under high 
pressure. It is not, of course, likely 
that any important practical use could 
be made of liquid air for the perma
nent insulation of apparatus. Highpressure air acts as a high insulator, 
but it is well known that low-pressure 
air acts as a very poor insulator. The 
earliest Edison steam-dynamos, for 
generating pressures in the neighbor
hood of 120 volts,, had armatures in 
which the copper bar conductors were 
insulated by air, over the greater part 
of their length. When driven at speed, 
however, these armatures were found 
to short-circuit internally through the 
air, probably owing to the low airpressure or partial vacum produced in 
the immediate neghborhood of the 
armature structure by the rapid rota
tion. Thereafter it became necessax-y 
to insulate the conductors with oiled 
paper. One direction in which it has 
been proposed to utilize the increased 
dielectric strength of high-pressure air 
is for increasing the potential, and 
oscillation energy of wireless telegraph 
antennae. The voltage at the sparkgap determines the energy of dis
charge, and this can be artificially in
creased by compressing the air be
tween the spark electrodes.Electrical 
World.
---------o---------
Notice.
It is hardly likely that compressed 
air will compete with oil for insulating 
purposes in connection with high-pressure machinery. It is true that the 
dielectric strength of oil is only about
6 kilovolts per millimetre; but oil 
tends tends to obliterate an arc, and 
is very conveniently applied to the 
parts to be protected. On the other 
hand, compressed air requires a very 
strong containing chamber for the ap
paratus, and makes tne introduction of 
the conducting leads difficult. Inspec
tion and repair are also hampered 
thereby. It would be very interesting 
to ascertain how liquid air behaves in 
regard to dielectric strength, by com

A Novel Rolling Mill Drive.
The application of electric power in 
rolling mills is no new thing, but it 
has been left for the works at Trzyneitz (advocates of simplified spelling 
please note) to carry the plan to its 
legitimate conclusion. The weak point 
in ordinary electrical driving is the 
enormous output momentarily required 
in a set of rolls, coupled with the 
regular necessity of reversing. The 
provide overload capacity enough in 
the motors and generators is almost 
out of the question, so that the utiliza
tion of flywheel capacity is almost a 
necessity. The plant under considera
tion is operated by a very ingenious 
modification of the well known Ward 
Leonard system, the starting gener
ators being directly driven by a 2,500- 
h. p. induction motor with two 26-ton 
flywheels, and feeding three drive 
motors mechanically coupled and con
nected in series. By this arrangement 
the flywheels back up the drive with
out themselves requiring reversal. The 
flywheels are brought into action by 
increasing the slip of the main motor 
by inserting resistance. A small 
auxiliary motor with its armature in 
series with the main motor and coun
terbalanced cuts in resistance and 
throws the burden on the flywheels 
whenever the input increases beyond 
a predetermined amount. About 1,000 
h.-p. steady input thus takes care of 
momentary calls for as much as 10,000
h.-p. The arrangement seems to be 
admirably effective and deserves to be 
followed in this country, as it is al
ready being followed abroad. There 
are many cases *in which gas engines 
operated by blast furnace gases can 
furnish very cheap power for rolling 
mills. A drive of this kind seems 
peculiarly adapted .to such conditions, 
since it equalizes the load extremely 
well, so as to give the fairly uniform 
output desirable for gas engines. The 
method adopted in this plant is cer
tainly a step in advance in this es
pecially strenuous class of work.

The appearance of a negro Rhodes 
scholar at Oxford has roused consid
erable opposition among the colony 
of American students at the English 
university. A. L. Locke, a negro 
student at Harvard, was the success
ful candidate for the scholarship from 
Pennsylvania, and was received at Ox
ford in the same manner as the other 
scholarship holders. The prejudices 
of a large part of the other scholars, 
among whom were a great many south
erners, were aroused by this and they 
joined in a petition of protest address
ed to the secretary of the Rhodes 
fund.
Locke is a Harvard graduate and 
made a good record as a student. He 
intends to engage in the work of edu
cating the negro race on his return to
America. As he was elected to the 
scholarship in the usual way it is 
thought that no concession can be 
made to the prejudices of the Ameri
cans.

building is of sandstone, and the in

Reflections of a Benedict.
Many a man chooses a wife as he 
would a cigarif the wrapper looks 
good, he bite?. Another man picks 
out one for her style, forgetting that 
the styles will change. But I can say 
one thing for my wife, when I get 
home late to a cold supper she always 
makes it hot for me. A friend of 
mine told me the other day I looked 
young to have been married before 
the war: just because I once re
marked that the fighting started a 
few weeks after my marriage. Some
times the onl^ way I can make my 
wife be good is to remind her of what 
the minister said when he tied the 
knot. After it was all over he said 
as he smiled upon us you are now 
one, and then, indicating me, he 
continued, and you are the one.
Speaking of married life, look at 
John Elden, he seems very happy 
he never married. Then there is Jud 
Freeborn, hes no bigamist, but he 
says he has one wife too many. An
other thing that answers the question 
as to whether or not marriage is a 
failure, is the fact that three-fourths 
of the men in the penitentiaries to
day are single. That doesnt mean 
that married men keep out of trouble 
better than single men, it simply goes 
to show that a man would rather be 
in jail than married.
Taken all in all, marriage is like 
a bum circus; those who are in want
to get out, and those who are cut want
to get in.
At a recent meeting of the faculty 
of Amherst College it was decided to 
refuse to grant the undergraduates

For the important foot ball games at 
Ittaca, N. Y., the line of ticket buyers 
begins to form three days before the 
tickets are put on sale. The Cornell 
Daily Sun is advocating the adoption 
of the method of ticket distribution in 
vogue at Yale. The money is sent in 
by mail before a certain date and the 
letters are drawn by lot and the tickets 
distributed according to the proceedure 
thus determined. In order to prevent 
ticket speculation the name of the 
purchaser is stamped on the back of 
the tickets and if the tickets are found 
in the hands of a speculator, the pur
chasers name is published in the Yale 
News and the privilege of ever buying 
any more tickets is refused him. Not 
only is the above method necessary for 
the distribution of foot ball tickets but 
also for tickets for dramatic or musical 
performances.

Mr. Aude, Sect. A-lWe will now 
have a curve that is not a straight 
line.
Prof. HokansonAre you being con
fused with the G-reek letters?

Prof.Well, that would just be the 
same as a cow would equal to Mur

Now that the Thanksgiving day 
class game is over and all 1912 is 
satisfied with the result attention will 
be turned to basketball. No doubt, 
as has been said, the 1912 Night class 
of the Red, Yellow, Green and Blue, 
will be in the field to meet any teams 
(school) that can in any way lay Claim 
to the championship title. 1912 is 
arranging to put upon the floor a fast 
team.
The cry is now, who is going to be 
our President? Let me tell you, fel
lows, that we will elect some body that 
will never be kidnapped by 1911. Who
is he?

1912 Defeats 1911.
One of the most hotly contested 
games of the season was witnessed 
Thanksgiving morning on the school 
campus between the night classes of
1911 and 1912. Both classes had 
made considerable preparation for the
game, the 1911 class being coached by 
Henderson, and 1912 class by MeVicker. It was expected that the game 
would be a fa:t one, owing to the in
tense rivalry between the classes dur
ing the rresent term, and the large 
number of enthusiastic rooters, among 
whom was the Director and several of 
the school faculty, were not disappoint
ed. The final score of 2-0 in favor of 
the class of 1912 wa:, well and justly 
earned, and during the second half it 
looked as if 1912 would score again, 
which was remarkable considering the 
fact that 1911 had a much heavier 
team. 1912 to the man played their 
best and was in the game from start 
to finish.

Last Wednesday was a great day for 
the Plebes. During the noon hour all 
sorts of rumors and counter rumors 
were being circulated as to whether 
there was to be school or not. From 
all the confusion reliable information 
was gotten and the truth finally learn
ed: all those who desired were excused 
from work and were to report to Prof. 
Reed at the oval to assist in getting 
things in shape for the game. Nearly 
all of the class were soon at work, 
carrying boards for the bleachers or 
rushing the lime cans. Mr. Reed is a 
wonder, for he had several hard at it 
who have so far never been guilty of 
soiling their hands or of running any 
chance of spoiling the creases in their 
immaculate trousers. It was hard 
work Plebes.. and no one can com
plain of the way in which it was done, 
either.
The game on Thanksgiving brought 
to light in a very glaring manner, the 
necessity of some regulations defining 
what is, and what is not the Carnegie 
plaid. The writer devoted consider
able time to observing the different 
varieties displayed, and came to the 
conclusion that the majority of the 
students have an idea that any old 
kind of a plaid will answer. The 
Stewart and the Campbell pure and 
simple were seen and a number of 
others that must have belonged to the 
House of O'Hooligan, having very little 
beside the color of the Emerald Isle. 
Banners having a mixture of pink, 
purple, black, and white were flung to 
the breeze along side of others that 
resembled the Solar spectrum hashed 
up and criss-crossed. At first it seem
ed funny. After thinking the situa
tion over it became anything but 
funny. When a school doesnt know 
its own colors, something is radically 
wrong. Will not some one who knows, 
kindly inform those who dont, and 
everyone wear one plaid, the right 
plaid, the Carnegie plaid?
Mr. DoseyYou can ram core sand 
as hard as you want to, but youve 
got to use your head in ramming 
moulds.

There were 84 Freshmen out for^the 
first basket ball practice at Purdue.
At the University of Michigan, which 
like many other State universities, is 
co-educational, the girls are asked to 
help out the athletic teams with 
money, although most often they do 
that without being asked. When Wis
consin was hard pressed for funds last 
spring to bring the crew east the girls 
raised money by basket ball games 
and helped very considerably, too, by 
sacrifices of their pocket money.

The LTniversity of Wisconsin, follow
ing in the footsteps of the University 
of Chicago, has decided to hold purity 
banquets in honor of visiting football 
teams. This is one of  Old Man 
Stagg's innovations, and has met with 
success. It has also been commended 
by opponents of college athletics as a 
step in the right direction towards 
purifying intercollegiate sports and 
eliminating the unfriendly rivalry 
which has been so prevalent hitherto.
The Board of Control of Michigans 
athletics has bee reorganized so that 
it will include two student members. 
It is thought that this change will 
bring about a complete reversal of 
Michigans official attitude on many 
questions of intercollegiate import
ance.
