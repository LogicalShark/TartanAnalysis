Wats:on? in CFA...Vandal ruins exhibit
By MICHELLE HAN
Tartan Staffwriter
After observing an art project in
stalled last Monday as part of the two 
day, campus-wide Watsion? Festival 
of the Arts, Natasha Oreskovich, a 
sophomore drama major, voiced her 
displeasure by tearing it down. She 
then entered the College of Fine Arts 
Deans office, located next to the 
project site, and announced her ac
tions and readiness to accept full re
sponsibility for what she had done.
The torn and crumpled pieces of the 
project were found in garbage cans 
just hours after the project had been 
put up. Eventually the project was 
put back on display in a looser form  
crumpled pieces of paper taped to the 
walls  along with areas of paper 
that were added for viewers to write 
their responses to the project and 
vandalism that was done. But the 
project was altered from its original 
form and misunderstood by those who 
viewed it, according to the members 
of the group who created it.
She took away our ability to com
municate what we wanted to, said

energy, said Gaultney. Altogether, 
weeks of discussion and planning 
went into the project, which culmi
nated in over 24 straight hours of 
working to have it installed in CFA. 
During the installation, the group 
members were spurred on by those 
passing by who stopped to look and 
read the quotes.
Many of the responses that people 
wrote on the walls after the incident 
occurred addressed the issue of de
stroying someone elses artwork and 
not the project itself, which few people 
saw in its intended form.
Positivity is a better vehicle for 
communication, wrote junior music 
major Ted Chletsos, addressing the 
vandalism. Tour end doesnt justify 
your means; you could have come up 
with a more productive medium. 
Tim Collins of the STUDIO for Cre
ative Inquiry, who teaches courses in 
the School of Art, addressed the 
makers of the art piece in a letter 
posted to the walls in CFA: The lack 
of respect for public expression is both 
tragic and debilitating. It forces us to 
retreat to our private studios and miti
gates the opportunity to experience/

what should be a 
supportive and 
open minded pub
lic realm. De
struction is not the 
solution to work 
you dont like or 
understand, dia
logue is.
I think there 
are two issues.
Kathryn Cohen, a sophomore in design 
and one of the group members who 
worked on the project. Youd think 
that CFA would be the most tolerant 
place, but this proves its just not.
The five members of the Interdisci
plinary Workshop who created the 
project were Jessica Burtis, junior in 
humanities and art, Kai Chi Cheung, 
a junior architecture major, Kathryn 
Cohen, a sophomore design major, 
Margaret Tarampi, a sophomore ar
chitecture major, and Stephanie 
Gaultney, a sophomore drama major. 
According to them, after they were 
given the news that their work was 
destroyed, their first thoughts were 
about the work they had put into it.
It was heartbreaking because of 
the amount of work and effort and
One is that we worked really hard, 
Cohen said. People didnt see it in its 
right form. [The second is] whether 
[Oreskovich] agreed with it or not, it 
was our work.
This is supposed to be the environ
ment where we are fostering our art, 
said Tarampi, who also said that dur
ing the projects conception, she and 
her group members found themselves 
engaging in just the type of discus
sion about CFA that they hoped their 
project would encourage. Its what 
we found we were doing, added 
Gaultney. Its about us.
The project was meant to promote 
discussion and allow people from vari
ous disciplines in CFA a place to con
front and engage in dialogue about the

Students criticize schedule 
changes at Town Meeting
Erica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Staff
Proposed changes to the Universitys 1998-99 calendar brought many students to last Wednesdays Town Meeting.
By MICHELLE W. CHAO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Facing widespread student opposition 
to its proposed, spring break changes, 
Carnegie Mellons administration held a 
Town Meeting last Wednesday to gather 
student feedback on the issue. With more 
than a hundred students crowded into 
the University Centers Alumni Hall, 
debate lasted for more than an hour as 
both graduate and undergraduate stu
dents expressed their opinions on the 
proposed schedule change.
Almost as soon as it was announced 
last February, the University Academic 
Calendar Committees (UACCs) plan to 
move spring break from the 11th to the 
ninth week of the semester met with 
student opposition, first from Student 
Senate and then from students them
selves on the emu.student.government 
bboard. In addition to suggesting 
the spring break changes, the UACC
considered a proposal to lengthen the fall 
terms midsemester break by one 
day and add an extra week to the end 
of the fall semester.
What it comes down to is simply a 
'matter of whether or not the school 
considers the student bodys opinion to 
be important, said junior computer sci
ence major Michael Strauss at the meet
ing. At least 100 students came to 
voice their opinions in opposition. To 
put it in easily understandable terms, 
that is $3,000,000 speaking and, obvi
ously, a representation of widespread 
sentiment. If the school does not con
sider that amount of student opinion 
important, then it no longer serves the 
students, does not earn its top 25 rat
ing, and we as students should consider 
whether we really are going to 
the right school.
Although all changes in the Univer
sity calendar are ultimately made by the 
Provost and President, the changes are
proposed by the UACC, whose sugges
tions are usually followed. Following an 
administrative mandate to establish a 
single University calendar  currently, 
the Heinz School and GSIA have differ
ent calendars than the rest of the Uni
versity  the UACC voted to change 
spring break despite a resolution from 
Student Senate that requested they not 
do so. The proposed change would move 
spring break between mini-courses three 
and four from its current location in the 
middle of mini-course four. Our goal is 
really to have one unified University 
calendar, explained UACC Chairman 
and Enrollment Services Co-Director 
John Papinchak, who mediated 
Wednesdays meeting.
The [spring] midsemester break 
works well where it is, said Charles 
Anthe, a junior electrical and computer 
engineering major. People use it to catch 
up on work and take a breather. Spring

SDC holds inaugural ceremony for new president, vice president
By DEAN S. HO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
At their weekly meeting last 
Wednesday, the Student Dormi
tory Council (SDC), held an inau
gural ceremony for 1998-99 SDC 
President Robert Migliore and 
Vice President Earl Crane. Dur
ing the first-ever ceremony, out
going SDC president Brian Bluth 
officially handed down the SDC 
gavel to third-year SDC member 
and junior electrical computer 
engineering major Rob Migliore.
Bluth hosted the inaugural cer
emony, which included speeches 
from SDC Advisor Kevin Hughes, 
former Vice President Glen 
Siniawski, and former SDC 
Presidents Austin Shifrin and 
Michael Sperger. Each of them 
spoke to a roomful of members, 
officers, parents, and onlookers 
about their experiences within 
SDC and offered some advice to 
incoming officers and members. 
For the first time in SDC hisKevin Babbitt/Tartan Features Editor tory, four past and present SDC 
Brian Bluth, 1997-98 SDC President, hands over the gavel to new presidents were together in the 
president Rob Migliore at last Wednesdays inauguration. same room.
Its a pleasure to work with 
such an energetic group, said 
Hughes. In his five years at 
Carnegie Mellon, Hughes said 
that he has seen a substantial 
growth in SDC membership. He 
mentioned how there were only 
five or six people at his first SDC 
meeting and how SDC has grown 
to about 30 members since then. 
He anticipates an even larger 
SDC community in the future.
Siniawski praised SDC and the 
former presidents who were at 
the ceremony. He also mentioned 
some of SDCs accomplishments, 
such as getting the SDC food com
mittee back into residence halls.
Shifrin, the 1995-96 SDC Presi
dent, explained SDCs mission 
statement to the observers: to 
help residence students enjoy a 
positive experience at CMU. 
Presidential responsibility and 
group support were two of the 
points he addressed in his speech.
SDC needs to talk about fun all 
the time, said Sperger, SDCs 
1996-97 president. SDC is de
signed and maintained for the sole 
purpose of having a good time. I
hope youre thinking about that 
all the time. He continued by 
speaking of failure and the need 
to fail in order to move forward. 
While Sperger will no longer be an 
active part of SDC, Sperger said 
that he hopes the focus and en
ergy of SDC will continue to be on 
having the greatest kind of fun.
The inaugural ceremony and 
his 15-month presidency ended 
when Bluth gave his final speech 
as SDC president. Despite his 
long tenure, he had nothing but 
positive words for his experience. 
Its been a wonderful trip, he 
said. One that Ill remember for 
the rest of my life. Like Sperger, 
Bluth gave advice to Migliore on 
the position of presidency. Your 
journey is just beginning, and 
although you may feel that you 
already have many SDC memo
ries, I can honestly tell you that 
the best is yet to come. You are at 
the start of a long road  one that 
is filled with many challenges 
and many rewards.... You are now 
charged with bringing the orga
nization to new heights. He went 
on to give words of encourage
ment about the inevitable hard
ships of the presidency. Its sup
posed to be hard. If it wasnt hard 
everyone would be doing it. The 
hard is what makes it good. Af
ter his speech, Bluth officially 
handed the gavel to Migliore.
Although Migliore did not give 
a speech at the inauguration, he 
said he was honored to hold the 
position. According to him, he 
already has goals that he wants 
to achieve as president, such as 
getting involved with the larger 
campus community and creating 
new SDC positions.
A lot of the things I hope to 
work on are the general rela
tionships, because that will help 
us be better committee members 
and better leaders, and hope
fully do better things for stu
dents. At the same time, Migliore 
said, he hopes to provide 
students with positive opportu
nities and give them something 
to be proud of.
As his first official duty as presi
dent, Migliore presided over the 
SDC general body meeting that 
followed the inauguration.

2The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 March 1998
  
Major stock markets 
contemplate merger
NEW YORK (AP) - The brash 
Nasdaq Stock Market and the lethar
gic American Stock Exchange are ex
ploring a marriage that could mount a
 significant threat to the prominence of 
'the New York Stock Exchange.
' A deal could be rewarding for inves-tors by increasing competition in pric
king stocks and could make it less ex
pensive for companies shares to be 
listed and traded in major markets.
 While confirming Thursday that 
-they were discussing a merger, the 
'two stock markets cautioned that a 
-deal wasnt certain.
Analysts said that chief among the 
obstacles was whether the exchanges 
can integrate their disparate trading 
systems and cultural and philosophi
cal differences that could make a 
merger unworkable.
The Nasdaq, which was founded in 
1971, has enjoyed a meteoric rise. It is 
home to some of the nations biggest 
high-tech companies, including soft
ware giant Microsoft Corp. It had 5,487 
listed companies at the end of 1997.
The 87-year-old Amex has seen its 
fortunes eclipsed by the NYSE and the 
Nasdaq. The Amex listed only 771 com
panies at year-end. Nasdaqs average
 daily stock volume is 646 million shares,
 compared to the Amexs 24 million.
But there was universal agreement 
' that a merger was good for both the 
Nasdaq and the Amex, especially 
strengthening the Nasdaq and con
solidating its position as an alterna
tive to the NYSE.
The Amex, like the NYSE, is an auc
tion market where stocks are bought 
and sold through an open outcry sys
tem centered around specialists on a 
trading floor. The Nasdaq, by contrast, 
has no trading floor and instead uses a 
computer network to trade stocks.
The exchanges did not reveal any 
details of how they would mesh their 
operations. But the Amex said a merger
 would combine the best features of 
its auction market and the Nasdaqs 
 electronic trading system.
To the extent a combination of the 
Amex and [Nasdaq] better serve their 
customers then this should be consid
ered a positive step, said NYSE chair
man Richard Grasso.
A merger could pose a formidable, 
though not immediate, challenge to 
the NYSE, which is locked in a tough 
rivalry with the Nasdaq. The NYSE 
has lured away prestigious companies 
from its two rivals in recent years and 
has taken the lead in recruiting for
eign companies to list their U.S. shares.
It may change the competitive land
scape, said Kenneth Alberstadt, a 
partner at the law firm Roberts, 
Sheridan & Kotel.
The Nasdaq, like the Amex, is domi
nated by smaller companies, many of 
which dont meet the listing require
ments for the NYSE. But companies 
tend to jump ship from the Nasdaq 
after becoming bigger  lured by the 
NYSEs prestige and a feeling that the 
auction system is a fairer and more 
efficient market.
Some industry observers said that a 
Nasdaq-Amex combination could be 
effective in stemming the tide of 
Nasdaq deserters. They said the 
Nasdaq may use the Amex to attract 
and retain large companies  con
vincing them that they can benefit 
from its strength in electronic trading 
and the Amexs auction system.
Last year alone, the NYSE swiped 
91 companies from Nasdaq, including 
the countrys leading online service 
company, America Online.
Although the deal would help boost 
the competitiveness of Nasdaq, 
analysts said its a bigger win for the 
Amex, which they said could be in 
a fight for its life if it remains an 
independent exchange.
Despite the optimism about the ben
efits of such a merger, however, Samuel 
Hayes, a professor of finance at 
Harvard Business School, said that 
since Amex is such a small part of Wall 
Street, the ultimate benefits to the 
investing public may be limited.
Morning fire guts 
Baptist sanctuary
SAXONBURG, Penn. (AP) - Fire de
stroyed a Baptist church this morning, 
the sixth arson attack in two months on 
a church in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The fire was set at about 4 am at the 
Calvary Baptist Church about 30 miles 
north of Pittsburgh, said Dan Boeh, an 
investigator with the U.S. Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
He said he did not believe the fire was 
related to the earlier blazes because the 
method of arson was different. He would 
not elaborate.
About 100 firefighters from eight com
panies battled the flames, which gutted 
the sanctuary of the Calvary Baptist 
Church in Jefferson Township.
Its totaled. I mean, the roof, basi
cally the metal beams and everything 
have collapsed, Fire Chief Gary Coo
per said. The churchs school, Calvary 
Academy, had smoke damage.
Associate pastor Joel Ward said pa
rishioners were aware of the other church 
fires, but thought Calvary Baptist was 
safe because it was 40 miles away from 
the nearest church that burned. The 
first five arson attacks were all south
east of Pittsburgh.
Three churches were destroyed and 
two were damaged in the other fires. 
Federal investigators havent said 
whether any of the arsons are related.
Authorities have made no arrests 
despite a $10,000 reward offered by 
the ATF.
All six burned churches served 
Protestant, predominantly white con
gregations. Calvary Baptist has about 
300 parishioners.
Heart attack kills Whitewater figure
WASHINGTON (AP) - Because he 
refused to take a drug test, Whitewater 
figure James McDougal was in solitary 
confinement in a Texas prison when he 
died of an apparent heart attack, a Bu
reau of Prisons spokesman says.
McDougal, who had a long history of 
serious medical problems, was placed in 
administrative detention Saturday 
night, and he was in a single cell by 
himself when he collapsed Sunday morn
ing, prison spokesman Todd Craig said.
On Sunday, a news release issued by 
the Federal Medical Center at Fort 
Worth, Texas, where McDougal was 
imprisoned, failed to disclose the soli
tary confinement. Ordinarily, McDougal 
was among the general inmate popula
tion at the medical center and held a job 
taking out the garbage.
The prison said McDougal had been 
segregated from the other prisoners in 
November for seven days for refusing to 
provide a urine sample.
Dr. Noland Hagood, McDougals phy
sician, said Monday night he was not 
concerned that prison officials had placed 
McDougal in solitary confinement  
pointing out that McDougal had lived 
alone for years in Arkadelphia, Ark.
McDougal developed hardening of the 
arteries in his 40s, and he had had 
bypasses for both his carotid arteries 
carrying blood from the neck into the 
brain, Hagood said. McDougal also had 
a bypass of his lower aorta, which pro
vides blood to the legs.
An autopsy was conducted on McDougal 
by the Tarrant County, Texas, Medical 
Examiners Office, and the preliminary 
results listed the cause of death as car
diopulmonary arrest  a heart attack.
President Clinton, who issued a state
ment Sunday expressing his condolences 
over McDougals death, doesnt plan to 
go to his former business partners fu
neral, White House spokesman Mike 
McCurry said.
El Nio unearths 
forest of stumps
NESKOWIN, Ore. (AP) - Like gnarled 
fingers rising from the surf, hundreds of 
stumps from an ancient forest buried at 
the time of Jesus are slowly being uncov
ered by El Nios pounding waves.
People have been making almost a 
religious pilgrimage to the rugged coast
line to see the more than 200 stumps 
poking up from beach.
To scientists, the reappearance of the 
ancient forest is further proof not only 
of the severity of this years El Nio but 
of the powerful earthquakes that once 
devastated Oregons coast  and could 
strike again.
Something had to kill those trees, 
and the evidence suggests it was earth
quake-related, said Mark Darienzo, a 
geologist with the state division of emer
gency management.
The prevailing theory is that a power
ful offshore quake 2,000 years ago 
dropped the coastline by as much as 7 
feet and submerged the trees.
Major quakes are believed to occur off 
Oregon once every 350 to 500 years. The 
last one, in 1700, swamped coastal for
ests and sent tsunami waves across the 
Pacific so powerful that they destroyed 
Japanese fishing villages.
Some of the old stumps at Neskowin 
made a brief appearance during another 
El Nino 15 years ago, and they have 
been visible again since mid-February, 
the product of weeks of El Nino-driven 
storms that have scoured the beach.
The stumps have become a tourist 
attraction. On a recent day, dozens of 
cars were parked along U.S. 101, a miles 
walk from the ancient, stumps. Hun
dreds of people took pictures and bent 
over for a closer look at the hardened, 2- 
to-3-foot-tall stumps.
Its really eerie, said 16-year-old 
Calvin Lotz. All I can say is, it must 
have been one hell of an earthquake.
Roger Hart, a geologist with Oregon 
State University, said currents will re
bury the Neskowin stumps by summer.
Coin toss decides 
building contract
LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) - Four 
rolls of the dice and a flip of a silver 
dollar settled a $7 million bet.
The banker was the Gwinnett County 
school system, and the payoff was a 
contract for a two-story addition at North 
Gwinnett High School.
It was wild, Denise Collier, who rep
resented the losing company in the winner-take-all competition, said Wednes
day. It seemed the fair thing to do.
It started when Colliers company, 
Bowen & Watson, and Salloum Con
struction Co. submitted identical bids of 
$6.986 million for the project. Because 
the bets were identical the school sys
tem decided a coin toss was in order.
The contractors first rolled the dice to 
see who would call the coin flip, Collier 
said. Each rolled a six, then fours, and 
again sixes. Finally Collier won the 
fourth roll. She called tails. It was heads.
Its unbelievable, said Jim Steele, 
chief operating officer for the school dis
trict, who could not recall another iden
tical bid in his 22 years with the system 
in the county northeast of Atlanta.
New calculations reveal asteroid will miss Earth easily
, WASHINGTON (AP) - Relax, Earth
lings. That asteroid streaking toward 
our planet is going to miss by miles. 
Actually, by 600,000 miles, according to 
new calculations.
. Just a day after one group of astrono
mers reported that an asteroid was ex
pected to pass within 30,000 miles of the 
Earths center and could possibly col
lide, astronomers at NASAs Jet Propul
sion Laboratory ( JPL)said their calcula
tions  based on newly uncovered data
 indicate the asteroid will pass no 
.closer than 600,000 miles away, 
.welloutside the moons orbit.
We are saying now that the probabil
ity of an impact is zero, said Donald K. 
Yeomans of JPL. It poses no threat to 
the Earth whatsoever.
Yeomans said he and fellow astrono
mer Paul W. Chodas dug out some eightyear-old pictures of the heavens taken by 
the Palomar Observatory telescope and 
found that the photos contained images 
of asteroid 1997 XF11, which then was 
just an unidentified point of light.
Using the 1990 pictures and recent 
observations of the streaking space rock, 
Yeomans and Chodas recalculated the 
orbital path of the asteroid and found 
that it would miss the Earth by 600,000 
miles in its approach in October 2028.
Brian G. Marsden of the International 
Astronomical Union, the astronomer who 
made the calculations released on Wednes
day, could not be reached for comment.
Steve Maran, an astronomer with the 
American Astronomical Society, said
.that Marsdens calculations were based 
on very limited data.
They got more information about the 
orbit, Maran said of Yeomans and 
Chodas. They should have a much 
better estimate. This should certainly 
be more reliable because it is based 
on more data.
By looking at the 1990 pictures, the 
researchers have a total of eight years of 
orbital measurements about the aster
oid. You really do need an intensive set 
of observations to nail it down, he said.
On Wednesday, Marsden had issued a 
notice that the asteroid was expected to 
pass within only 30,000 miles of the 
Earths center. The chance of an actual 
collision is small, but one is not entirely 
out of the question, he concluded.
Those calculations were based on 
short measurements taken just last 
week and included less of the asteroids 
orbital path than the old, archival pic
tures from Palomar. Yeomans said 
that after hearing of the other forecast 
from IAU, astronomers at JPL sought 
out the archival photos, and did the 
new calculations.
Even though the asteroid will pass 
outside of the Earth-moon complex, 
Yeomans said it will still be spectacu
larly close for an object that is about one 
mile across.
Even though the Earth now appears 
safe from asteroid 1997 XF11, thousands 
of other asteroids that, theoretically, 
could one day approach the Earth are 
still out there, Maran said.
This whole exercise was a useful re
minder of the fact that these things can, 
in fact, hit the Earth, said Maran.
An asteroid six to 10 miles in diameter 
smashed into the Gulf of Mexico 65 mil
lion years ago and is thought to have 
caused the extinction of 75 percent of all 
animal species, including the dinosaurs.
News of the Earth:approaching aster
oid likely will be welcome in Hollywood 
because it could stoke interest in two 
upcoming movies.
Theaters are already showing previews 
of the May 8 release Deep Impact, pro
duced by Steven Spielberg, which deals 
with the scramble for shelter space when 
comets approach Earth. Aj'mageddon, a 
meteor thriller with Bruce Willis, is due 
out July 1.

1948  John Lighton Synge an
nounced his resignation as head 
of the Mathematics Department 
to be able to accept a senior pro
fessorship at the Dublin Insti
tute for Advanced Studies. He 
had recently been appointed to 
the position after serving as a 
ballistic mathematician during 
World War II.
25 YEARS AGO, March 20, 
1973  Four prominent political 
figures addressed The Power of 
the Presidency and Individual 
Liberties, a forum sponsored by 
the Students Activities Office and 
the Chaplains Association.

Thornburgh engaged in a debate 
about the recent allegations 
against U.S. President Richard 
Nixon in the context of individual 
civil liberties.
TEN YEARS AGO, March 15, 
1988  The City of Pittsburghs 
Fire Department assigned arson 
specialists to investigate a string 
of suspicious fires in the Mellon 
Institute. Three separate rooms 
of the building had caught fire in 
the previous two weeks; all be
gan in the evening hours when 
workers had left.
Firefighters found evidence of 
tampering with smoke detect
ing and sprinkling systems. In 
an effort to tighten security in 
the building, Campus Police of
ficers planned to close every en
trance except one, where a guard
was to be stationed to monitor 
the building.
FIVE YEARS AGO, March 
15, 1993  The Student Senate 
began impeachment proceedings 
against Student Body President 
Natalie Gesmond. Led by Sena
tor Greg Haverkamp, the Sen
ate passed a resolution citing 
her frequent absences from Sen
ate meetings, failure to keep 
weekly office hours, and delin
quency in establishing Senateapproved committees. In her 
defense, Gesmond said she was 
hospitalized for a serious blood 
disease in the previous semester 
and had arranged alternates and 
special reviews of meetings from 
which she was absent.
Several members questioned 
the motives of Haverkamp, who 
himself was criticized for falter
ing in his senatorial duties and
who, as chair of the Senate ac
cording to Senate bylaws was to 
succeed the impeached president.
ONE YEAR AGO, March 17, 
1997  The administration an
nounced after a mid-February 
hearing that the Kappa Sigma 
fraternity violated the terms of 
their housing lease and was not 
going to be able to reside in Uni
versity housing in the fall.
The fraternity vowed to ap
peal the decision. Kappa Sigmas 
troubles began on pledge night 
in September 1996, when an in
dividual had to be sent to the 
hospital in what Campus Police 
called a liquor laws violation. 
The fraternitys national organi
zation had previously suspended

The officer called the floral shop 
and discovered that the order had 
come via I-8OO-FLOWERS. He 
contacted a.customer service rep
resentative there and was told 
that the order was placed over 
the Internet with the stolen card.
3/8 DISORDERLY CON
DUCT, 4:54 pm  A manager at 
The Original Hot Dog Shop in the 
University Center called Campus 
Police requesting assistance in 
handling an irate ex-employee. 
The actor had been causing a dis
turbance after quitting his job, 
but when the officer arrived, the 
actor had calmed down and was 
having a normal conversation with 
the manager. The officer advised 
the actor that he could leave on 
his own accord or that he would be 
escorted off CMU property. Addi
tionally, the officer explained that 
the actor would be subject to ar
rest for defiant trespass if he re
turned to CMU property in the 
future. The actor then left the

area without any further incident.
Later, the manager provided 
the officer with the events lead
ing to the disturbance. Appar
ently, someone had stolen money 
from the safe at The O, and the 
manager suspected the actor. He 
informed the actor that he was 
not accusing him of theft, but if 
he wanted to make restitution for 
the missing money, he could. It 
was at this point that the actor 
quit his job and started yelling 
and throwing boxes and coffee 
sacks around.
3/9 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
3:17 am  Three Campus Police 
officers responded to an activated 
smoke detector in the rear stair
well of a fraternity house. When 
they arrived, they found no fire, 
but there was smoke billowing 
out of the rear stairwell door. The 
door was being held open by some 
fraternity brothers who told the 
officers that the smoke was com
ing from a smoke machine on the 
first floor. They had been yelling 
at another brother asking why he 
turned the machine on.
When the officers got to the 
first floor, they found it completely
filled with the thick, white smoke, 
but they were unable to find the 
machine. The officers then told 
the brothers that they wanted to 
speak to the male who had acti
vated the machine. The brothers 
then stated that the machine had 
malfunctioned. Because of the 
discrepancy with their earlier 
statements and their failure to 
produce the male who had acti
vated the machine, the house was 
issued an internal citation for 
criminal mischief. The fire sys
tem was reset without incident.
3/11 HARRASSMENT BY 
COMMUNICATION, 8:52 pm 
 An officer took an incident 
report from a Cathedral Man
sions resident. She had received 
700 to 800 emails the day before 
from whoever@wh.atever.com.lieT 
boyfriend figured out that the mes
sages originated on campus. The 
victim was told to forward all the 
profane email to the Campus Po
lice detective. She said she had no 
idea who was sending the mes
sages or why.
3/12 FRAUD, 9:56 am - A 
Computing Services employee
reported to Campus Police that a 
CMU credit card was fraudu
lently used. The card had been 
used to purchase $7555.58 worth 
of marble tile from Potenza Tile. 
The card had only been legally 
used once to buy tape drives from 
Continental Computer.
She spoke with the co-owner of 
Potenza Tile. She said that a 
man with her credit card made 
the purchase. Police think it 
likely that a credit card was fab
ricated using the crdit card num
ber and expiration date that had 
been used in the Continental 
Computer transaction.
3/12 MEDICAL, 11:44 am - 
A work-study student employed 
at the Center for Innovation in 
Learning in Hamburg Hall pur
chased a muffin for lunch. She 
asked the vendor if the muffin 
contained nuts, because she is 
allergic to all nuts. The vendor 
told her no.
After eating some of the muf
fin, she realized that it indeed 
contained nuts, and she began 
to suffer a severe anaphylactic 
reaction shortly after. Her su
pervisor contacted Campus Police about the emergency.
When the officer arrived, the 
victim was having difficulty 
breathing and speaking, and her 
eyes and mouth were swollen. The 
officer transported her to Presby
terian Hospital.
3/13 MEDICAL, 9:24 pm - An 
officer responded to Morewood 
Gardens to assist in subduing a 
highly intoxicated male who was 
fighting with CMU EMS and resi
dents of his floor. When they ar
rived, five people were trying to 
hold the actor while EMS tried to 
treat him. The floor residents said 
that he had drunk approximately 
375 mL of vodka. City medics were 
called in, and he was transported 
to University of Pittsburgh Medi
cal Center ER for treatment.
3/14 MEDICAL, 2:35 am - 
While on bicycle patrol, an officer 
was stopped by an individual near 
the University Center who stated 
that someone had passed out in 
the first floor mens room. The 
officer went inside the building 
and found a person prone in the 
first stall of the mens room. The. 
stall door was locked, but the
victims torso was hanging out-^ 
side of the stall. After finding 
the victim unresponsive to his 
questions, the officer contacted 
CMU EMS for assistance. The 
officer noticed the odor of alcohol 
during his wait.
When the victim woke up, the 
officer asked if he had been drink
ing. The student replied that he 
had. After identifying the stu
dent, the officer issued him a ci
tation for underage consumption.

the ceiling in front of the office of the dean of 
CFA, creating a barrier to the hall as well as 
setting apart a space for people to view the work 
in. Sheets of paper hung from these beams, 
which bore quotes that the group had solicited

One of the goals of the Wats:on? Festival of

nity together in order to foster interdiscipli

Arts, and to extend these ideas to the entire 
Carnegie Mellon campus and to the greater 
Pittsburgh community. The act, however, 
points to a larger issue of mistrust, group 
project members said.

Gaultney added. Its about this school, its 
about who we are.

No one saw it. Something needs to be done.
An open forum will be held today, Monday

dalism. The issues of respect, disrespect, and 
tensions between disciplines within CFA will 
also be addressed and debated. The artists 
involved encourage all students who are inter

Town meeting provides forum for debate
MEETING, from page 1
break is used by many people to do Spring Carnival 
booth construction. That purpose would be lost if 
the break were two weeks earlier because most 
people arent building yet. So basically, moving 
break does not make sense from either an aca
demic, social, or quality-of-life point of view, so why 
do it? If none of these interests are served and the 
students feel it does not improve their academic 
performance or their social life on campus, what 
purpose does it serve?
Despite Papinchaks reassurances that he 
would transmit student feedback to the rest of 
the UACC, several students doubted the 
administrations sincerity.
It seems as though the committee only held the 
meeting just for show  from all appearances, our 
ideas and opinions were blatantly disregarded and 
brushed off by a deceptively mild and diplomatic 
spokesperson for the Calendar Committee, said 
Deborah Chow, a sophomore professional writing 
and business double major. This school is taking far 
too many liberties that [its] not entitled to, espe
cially with all this outcry from the student popula
tion. Chow also commented that the UACC ap
peared to be catering to Heinz and GSIA students at 
the expense of other students since the two graduErica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Staff

ate schools combined population 
is less than one-third of the total 
student body.
Although the UACC has not 
voted on the proposal to lengthen 
the fall semester  which is cur
rently shorter than the spring 
semester by about a week  the 
idea of such a plan upset many 
people, including international 
students. Its very true that this 
situation is less than acceptable 
to many of us as it takes an awful 
lot of time to travel home and 
back and we have jet lag which 
prevents us from enjoying the 
[holiday] festivities back home 
because of constant drowsiness 
and tiredness, said Anwesha 
Rakshit, a sophomore computer 
science major from the United 
Arab Emirates. Other students 
noted that moving the last day of 
exams to three days before 
Christmas would drive up their 
plane fares tremendously, and 
in the case of extensive delays or 
trans-continental flights, would 
not allow them to arrive home 
until just before the holiday.
However, the UACCs decision was not entirely 
without support. The change to an earlier break 
seems sensible to me. I favor it for three reasons, 
said John Hayes, professor of psychology and di
rector of the Center for Innovation in Learning. 
One, it is better for the scheduling of mini-courses. 
Two, it breaks the semester up more evenly so that 
students dont have such a long stretch, and they 
can relax a bit. Three, it provides a better marker 
for the halfway point in the semester.
I support pushing spring break up two weeks so 
that it falls right in the middle of the semester, said 
Michelle Wright, an assistant English professor. I 
prefer an earlier break because I think a late break 
leaves too little time between students returning to 
class and the end of the semester. In other words,

they dont come back ready to return to their books,' 
but they come back thinking that the semester is; 
almost over and feel impatient when in class.
But I dont support adding an extra week to the 
[fall] semester. The American school year is much 
longer than it is in Western Europe, but European 
students consistently score higher on tests than 
American students. In other words, it seems that thei 
quality of education, not the quantity of it, makes the! 
difference. And CMU is already known for providing 
a quality education. I dont think adding an extra 
week will make students smarter or more relaxed.' 
The UACC met on Thursday to discuss both the 
students input and the calendar proposals. It made 
no decisions, although Student Body President Bryort 
Krug noted at last weeks Senate meeting that the 
UACC was aware of student opinion on the matter:

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University16 March 1998
Course descriptions 
need to be expanded
More information is always bet
ter than less, especially when stu
dents are tryingto choose classes. 
^Student Senate showed impres
sive initiative last week by poll
ing students about what kind of 
Class-related information could 
tetter help them decide what 
courses they wanted to take. The 
proposed Student Senate plan to 
increase the amount of courseevaluative material available on 
The HUBs Web site should be 
.implemented as soon as possible 
;so the students will have the in
formation by fall registration.
At present, students looking for 
class information can find little 
more than the schedule and an 
often-outdated blurb describing a 
course. Student Senates plan to 
catalog a variety of information on 
every class  including faculty 
course evaluations (FCEs), a sylla
bus, the division of work, due dates 
of major projects and exams, and 
Student opinions from FCEs  will 
give a more cohesive view of what 
students can expect from a class.
Most of the information that 
would be included in the catalog 
is already available but not in one 
convenient location. If professors 
FCEs were linked to their courses 
in an online schedule, both stu
dents and teachers would be more 
likely to look at the results and 
take them more seriously. This 
would lead to higher teaching 
quality because professors would 
realize that students could readily 
access their evaluations. Since 
students often decide to take a 
class based on the professors
reputation, having more informa
tion about a professors perfor
mance is vital.
If professors were required to 
provide a syllabus and a prelimi
nary list of due dates on the Web 
site, it would help students avoid 
taking two or more classes with 
project or exam due dates that 
coincide. Seeing a syllabus con
taining a list of required books 
and a statement of the courses 
goals would also prevent students 
from taking classes that do not 
appeal to them or from overlook
ing ones that do. Plus, it could 
curb the overloading that students 
do just to find out which classes 
they like. Eliminating this kind 
of shopping will result in fewer 
drops, adds and audits dining 
the semester.
The incoming first-year class 
will also benefit from this kind of 
information on The HUBs Web 
site list of courses. Although they 
frequently have little control over 
their first semester schedules, by 
seeing syllabi, students opinions, 
and work estimates, they could 
come to CMU with a better un
derstanding of the college aca
demic environment.
With input gathered by Student 
Senate about which information 
will help students most when 
choosing classes, The HUB will 
be able to produce a thoroughly 
informative Web site that all stu
dents can access when determin
ing their schedules. The changes 
to the Web site, if well-imple
mented, will be a tremendous re
source come registration time.
Students should 
continue open forum
' Last Wednesdays spring break 
Town Meeting proved that CMU 
.can be a community that creates 
and sustains an open dialogue 
about an important issue. Gradu
ate and undergraduate students 
turned out in full force to voice 
.their concerns over the calendar 
changes. Perhaps it was because 
students felt their opinions were 
not heard or maybe it was be
cause publicity about the event 
was heightened, but last weeks 
strong show of concern about a 
campus issue was something 
CMU students do not do often 
enough. Students need to continue 
in the spirit of the spring break 
discussions and take the initia
tive to participate more in Uni
versity decisions.
Town Meetings are not a new 
.thing at CMU. They have been 
held to address many different top
ics, including the search for the 
president and University Center 
rules and regulations. The admin
istration has tried to use these fo
rums to collect student input, but 
they are not usually well-attended.
Last weeks Town Meeting turn
out of over a hundred students 
was significant. But when the 
topic at hand is not as close to 
students hearts as their vaca
tions, feedback on University is
sues is pathetically low. Students

the Squirrel Hill shuttle, resi
dence hall room furniture, alumni 
relations  ultimately affect them 
because they are the primary 
population of the University com
munity. Therefore their voices 
need to be stronger and clearer on 
a more consistent basis. This way, 
the administration will know how 
much students care about their 
living and working environment.
Students should be commended 
for showing their concern for the 
spring break calendar changes. 
The talk that bboard posts and 
email from student senators gen
erated only helped to emphasize 
the importance of this meeting. 
But not every topic will be as 
sensational as the spring break 
change. There are numerous other 
day-to-day issues that require just 
as much student enthusiasm and 
attention. If students can recog
nize this and act upon it, maybe 
their opinions will be taken more 
seriously by the administration.
Town meetings that offer a 
venue to voice opinion should be 
taken advantage of not only by 
attendance, but also by present
ing constructive criticism that 
the administration can utilize in 
making their decisions. Contin
ued student involvement with 
campus issues will strengthen the 
open dialogue between adminis
tration and the student body that 
is sorely lacking.
Recently, CMU administration decided 
to raise undergraduate tuition by 4.9 
percent, or roughly $1200, amidst stu
dent protests over what has already 
become a sky-high tuition cost. But un
fortunately, after speaking with repre
sentatives from the administration about 
this rise in tuition, I must conclude that 
it is not unwarranted and is just part of 
what has become a national trend. Uni
versities all over the country, especially 
private ones, have been raising their 
tuition to exorbitant levels recently, and 
this trend is bound to continue for at 
least another 10 years.
The tuition at CMU, when compared 
to our tier-one and tier-two competitors 
such as MIT, Princeton, Cornell, the 
University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, 
and the University of Chicago, is below 
average. In fact, of the 10 schools with 
which CMU usually competes, only 
Northwestern has a lower tuition rate. 
And when other costs such as room and 
board are factored into the equation, 
CMU actually ranks equal with North
western as the lowest-priced school in 
these two tiers.
This explains how CMU can still be on 
solid financial ground. But many stu
dents want to know: What about our 
endowment? Ah yes, the endowment, 
that famed pot of gold that sits some
where up in President Cohons office
guarded by tiny little elves called CPAs.
According to CMU Assistant Vice 
President for Finance William Laird, 
CMUs current endowment stands at 
around $592 million, which is not bad in 
the least. Of that endowment, roughly 
70 percent is invested in stocks, annu
ities, and the like, and the other 30 
percent in bonds and more secure forms 
of investment. The University plans to 
use the endowment conservatively and 
only budgets for a much smaller per
centage of growth than the endowment 
actually earns. What does this mean? 
It means that more money is actually 
being re-invested into the endowment 
so our little pot of gold can grow bigger 
and bigger.
You may ask why the endowment is 
important, and that is really quite simple. 
There are two main purposes for the 
endowments existence. First, it is the 
income of the school. The school cannot 
spend the $592 million that makes up the 
endowment. Instead, what they can spend 
is the earnings from the endowment. 
This includes interest, dividends, and 
such. It is that amount that is the schools 
primary income. Like a fruit tree, the 
school feeds the endowment and allows it 
to grow while only harvesting the sweet 
fruit from its branches.
The second reason the endowment is 
important is certainly less noticeable 
but still important to students. Many 
college rankings take into account, and 
use as their primary ranking source, the 
size of a schools endowment. It is at this 
point that the word endowment takes
on a different meaning, and we are no 
longer just talking about the size of the 
schools bank account.
Finally, students must consider the 
fact that the University spends around 
$28,000 to educate every undergradu
ate student here. Accordingto Laird, the 
University knowingly spends more than 
the tuition price on each student. It is 
because of this that the endowment is 
important for CMU, as it picks up part 
of the cost of paying for teachers, build
ings, and other services.
Also, students must consider the capi
tal improvements that have gone on at 
CMU in the past few years. None of 
these were funded by the endowment  
instead, the University had to raise 
the money in other ways. These capital 
improvements, while certainly needed, 
distracted many donors from giving to 
the endowment fund, as their money 
went into the capital improvement 
fund instead.
After looking closely at the funding of 
CMU, one has to admit that the tuition 
increase students will receive next year, 
while not easy to swallow, is not unjust 
or unfair. The University has pledged 
that as tuition prices increase, so will 
financial aid packages. Although the 
University cannot make paying the in
crease painless and without sacrifice, it 
will try everything in its power to help 
students attend CMU.

Dash Boyer-Olson
The government now finds 
itself in the midst of a debate 
about whether drunk driving 
standards should be set at the 
federal level. Currently, 
drunk driving standards are 
determined at the state level. 
On March 4, the Senate voted 
to force states to adopt a uni
versal drunk driving standard 
or face the loss of federal high
way funds.
If passed in the House, the 
bill will set 0.08 percent as 
the national legal blood alco
hol limit, which is lower 
than the current levels in 
many states. The states would 
not be forced to adhere to the 
0.08 percent blood alcohol 
standard, but they would 
stand to lose significant fed
eral highway funds by not 
adopting this level as their 
standard. Currently, 15 states 
have a legal blood alcohol limit 
of 0.08 percent, but most 
states are still at the 0.1 per
cent limit.
This new bill was passed in 
the Senate, but it has signifi
cant opposition in the House. 
Not only would the bill estab
lish a superior uniform stan
dard to judge drunk drivers, 
but it would save lives by low
ering the blood alcohol limit 
in many states.
One of the major opponents 
of the bill is majority whip 
Don Nickles (R-Okla.), who 
claims that the bills provi
sions would be detrimental to 
the states efforts, to fight 
drunk driving. Senator 
Nickles feels that each state 
should be able to make 
its own decision about 
the legal limit for blood 
alcohol level. I am com
pletely in favor of states 
governing themselves 
with regard to issues 
that are unique to indi
vidual states.
However, states are 
not unique with regard 
to the level of drunken
ness at which a driver 
becomes legally im
paired. Does it take 
more alcohol in the 
blood to become legally 
impaired in Pennsylvania than it does in 
Virginia? Geography 
does not make a differ
ence in how well a per
son drives while under 
the influence. Some is
sues are better left for the 
states to decide, but in this 
case, we should decide as a 
nation what constitutes a 
drunk driver.
Another argument against 
the bill is offered by Pennsyl
vania GOP representative 
Bud Shuster, who said, ac
cording to a March 5 Wash
ington Post article, that the
best way to encourage states 
to curb drunk driving is by 
providing incentives, not 
threats. The threat that 
Shuster speaks of is the loss of 
highway funds that states 
would face if they did not adopt 
the 0.08 percent blood alcohol
Mark Adato/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
limit. But the proposed bill is stead of on how to most effecvention is actually quite 
minimal and should be of 
no concern.
While the alleged negative 
aspects of the bill are easily 
dismissed, the benefits of 
the bill are very clear. First, 
the universal standard would 
alleviate any confusion 
that currently exists 
about how the legal 
limit for blood alco
hol levels differs from 
state to state.
The bill is also attrac
tive because it would set 
a lower level for the 
states that are still at 
the 0.1 percent legal 
limit. The Post article 
states that if the entire 
country were to adopt a 
legal blood alcohol limit 
of 0.08 percent, an esti
mated 500 to 600 lives 
could be saved per year. 
There is no reason why 
this bill should not be 
passed. The opponents 
of the bill are blindly 
focusing on maintaining 
power for the states innot encouraging or discourag
ing the states from curbing 
drunk driving  it is merely 
providing a uniform standard 
to judge whether drivers are 
drunk. If the bill is passed, 
the states will still be free to 
implement their own pro
grams to fight drunk driving. 
The degree of federal intertively combat drunk driving. 
Hopefully, these opponents 
will re-evaluate the merits of 
the bill before the vote in 
the House.

American celebration trivializes Irish culture
Luke Brindle
Imagine if on May 5, the Mexi
can national holiday, Cinco de 
Mayo, Americans celebrated 
Mexican culture by pretending to 
be illegal immigrants for the day 
 dashing across borders, los
ing their identification papers, 
and cheating on welfare.
While some right-wing politi
cal figures would encourage such 
behavior, I, myself, would be re
pulsed by this complete 
trivialization of Mexican culture.
But something equivalent to this 
goes on every year around this 
time  St. Patricks Day. Thats 
when many Americans become 
Irish for the day  which usu
ally means engaging in all sorts of 
alcohol-related activities while 
wearing the green. Youll see 
shamrock ties and shakes, lepre
chaun hats and impersonators  
and a hefty profit for Arthur 
Guinness brewery.
These activities really have very 
little to do with what a day hon
oring a saint really means: Its a 
serene holiday dedicated to re
flections with the family and 
maybe going to Mass. Indeed, the 
way we celebrate the day in
America corresponds little to the 
facts about Irish society. Irish 
people per capita have one of the 
lowest levels of alcohol con
sumption in all of Europe. Irish 
society is much more complex, 
culturally and politically, than 
Americans believe.
Im certainly not advocating a 
complete cessation of celebratory 
activities for this holiday: I dont 
think its fair to say that the cel
ebrants are consciously insulting 
an entire nation by running 
around with green beer and lep
rechaun socks. The problem is 
that most people are not even 
conscious that they are making a 
mockery out of Irish culture. The 
problem is a lack of awareness.
This lack of awareness not on
ly translates into cultural igno
rance, but into political igno
rance as well.
There is, as some might be 
aware, an awful conflict going on 
in Ireland. The situation is rela
tively calm now, since peace ne
gotiations are going on. The issue 
to be resolved is of great signifi
cance the very structure of the 
United Kingdom and Ireland.
As it is structured now, the 
island of Ireland is divided into 
two different countries. The 
Northern part, composed of six
counties, was gerrymandered 
from the rest of the Island in the 
early 1920s when, after hundreds 
of years, the English colonialist 
government was expelled from 
the other 80 percent of the Isle.

Gerrymandering is when a 
regions electoral boundaries are 
tinkered with to ensure a certain 
political outcome in that region. 
Northern Ireland was created to 
allow the English government to 
control a part of Ireland  a part 
in which the majority of the
people wanted to remain under 
English control.
This cycle is vicious: To ensure 
support, the English gave cul
tural, political, and social prefer
ences to the people who wanted 
them to stay (called Unionists 
because they want the union of 
Northern Ireland and Britain to 
be upheld). Opportunities inhous
ing and employment were denied 
to the part of the population who 
identified not with another is
land, but with Ireland (called Na
tionalists because they want the 
whole island of Ireland to be 
united in one country). Indeed, 
property qualifications on voting 
gave wealthy people (Unionists, 
again, following this cycle) mul
tiple votes, further entrenching 
their domination.
As demographics shifted and 
the Nationalist population 
started a civil rights movement 
in the late 1960s (inspired by the 
Civil Rights movement in 
America at the same time), the 
struggle intensified.
Through the most recent years, 
though, there have been signifi
cant developments that suggest 
that a lasting solution to the con
flict is in sight.
But the situation is too com
plex to address in this manner.
However, it does serve to show 
just how much there is to be 
learned about Ireland.
So I would encourage you to 
celebrate St. Patricks Day and 
Ireland this day. Party, have fun, 
be Irish for the day. But if you 
have an interest, dont just be 
Irish for the day  be Irish for 
the year.
Youve probably noticed a 
plethora of things Irish in mod
em culture. Truly, there is much 
more to Irish culture than foam, 
toasts, and pints. Just consider 
Irish folk music, literature, and 
poetry. James Joyce, William 
Yeats, and Nobel Prize winner 
Seamus Heaney are only the tip 
of the iceberg in Irish literature.
And get involved with Ireland. 
There are dozens of Irish histori
cal, literary, cultural, and politi
cal groups in Pittsburgh. The 
people are good-natured and are 
quite willing to share in a real 
love of Ireland with you.
Have a happy St. Patricks Day.
Have a happy St. Patricks Year.

Art can mix with science
Cfiean /ValSusan Caldwell
With the amount of discrimination Ive 
encountered as an artist, it might be ex
pected of me to rant and rave about the 
lack of appreciation and understanding of 
artists on campus and in this country and 
vent my frustration on the outnumbering 
technocrats and dismiss them as closeminded capitalists with boring and stress
ful jobs. Perhaps I could give CIT an acro
nym  Culturally Impaired Technocrats 
 as vindication for Cant Fuckin Add 
and H and Less Stress. I could even focus 
my artwork on anti-computer philosophies 
and write social protest stories about hu
mankind viewing technology as God.
Instead, I would like to go to war on 
misunderstandings and stereotypes. What 
makes science and math people think art
ists cannot add? Why do artists assume 
that engineers and business majors hate 
their jobs? Both questions are based on an 
arrogance about ones own livelihood that 
relies on belittling or dismissing another. 
'For instance, do techies think that artists 
arent smart enough to be in a business/ 
computer/science-oriented field so our ma
jors are weaknesses, based on what we 
cant do instead of what we can? The acro
nym Cant Fuckin Add is testament to this 
belief. Realistically, CFA majors internal
ize math and science in a completely differ
ent way than more technical majors: Music 
is based on math, and much art is based on 
the science of color and form, as well as the 
science of life. On the other hand, artists 
often use the sour-grapes defense mecha
nism  They-work-for-the-Man-so-Iwouldnt-want-to-be-one-of-them-anyway. 
But they fail to realize that chemical pro
cesses rely on rhythm and writing a com
puter program is an act of creation.
Moreover, a huge conflict lies within the 
different departments inside of CFA. CFA, 
the most welcoming building on campus, 
harbors the conflict between the different 
departments. Each department has its own
separate floor. The only interaction is in the 
elevator. Dramats and music majors rarely 
use the elevator, and the second floor archi
tecture masters candidates, usually clad 
in business attire, look warily atthe younger 
artists and designers on the third floor. On 
the third floor of CFA, where the school of 
art lends first-year designers their studios, 
practicality (to get a job) and impracticality 
(to feed my soul) meet every day. Every so 
often, some sort of catalyst will allow for 
the artists and designers to duke it out, like 
the chalkboard in the lobby on the art floor. 
On the chalkboard, some art majors called 
the design majors sellouts, and the design
ers wrote things like Design is art applied 
to a higher function. What? Comments 
like these not only worsen the conflict, but 
display the insecurities of both parties. 
Artists and designers, as well as others in 
CFA and the other CMU schools, should do 
their own thing to their fullest potential 
and approach other disciplines with an 
open mind; otherwise, we all miss out.
This is why the Wats:on? Festival in Jill 
Watsons memory is so important to CFA 
and CMU. As the TA for my freshman art 
history class and an architect, she spoke of 
famous artists and architects with the same 
reverence because she understood how nec
essary they both were for her own process. 
Furthermore, her theory of interspatiality
 the integration of all artistic disciplines
 is key in promoting the understanding 
between artists, scientists, engineers, 
businesspeople, researchers  everyone. 
Whether we work together or alone, make 
tons of money or a little, speak to the world 
or to ourselves, we all take part in the 
cosmic. We all contribute to the progressive 
energy of the earth, just as we do to the 
diversity of the campus community. 
Squares and circles, blues and reds may be 
math to some and art to others, but above 
all, they just are. What would anyones life 
be without them?

Infidelity leads to scandal
JJ______
William-Neil Guzy
The maj ority of the American public has 
a great deal of interest in the Presidential 
sex scandal. Its a fact. If ratings were low 
and newspaper sales were down, there 
would be another lead story. Infidelity is 
atthe root of this scandal and is something 
that challenges almost every committed 
relationship at some point. Can the rela
tionship be saved when the commitment 
is broken? Sure, but it isnt worth saving.
A relationship is based on a commit
ment. If its broken, its over. I dont 
understand the line of reasoning based 
on giving someone a second chance. It 
comes down to the foundation of a com
mitted relationship: It is built on loy
alty, trust, and honesty. It isnt easily 
established and is even harder to pre
serve and develop.
The mass media shines its spotlight on 
the extramarital activities of the rich and 
famous. Kathie Lee Gifford swallowed 
her pride and every ounce of self-respect 
when she took back her senior-citizen 
husband, Frank. On the surface, Hillary 
Clinton is a woman consumed by ambi
tion and power. However, she lacks all 
control over her own marriage and her 
husbands sexual escapades. Hillary 
needs to drop that zero and get herself a 
hero or, at least, a male White House 
intern. The media seem to shy away from 
stories in which the famous and powerful 
male takes back a cheating female.
Regardless of your gender, if the other 
person cheats and is taken back, things 
will always be different. The cheater 
will always look at you as the person 
who indirectly approved of their indis
cretion by taking them back. The cheater 
will feel as though he or she has one up 
on the other person in the relationship.
Some individuals believe that they can 
teach their unfaithful partners the way
through sadistic demands and lessons. 
My friend Kate recently invited me to a 
bonfire. Her current boyfriend had cheated 
on her. His bedroom suite was being 
torched along with all his other belong
ings that the other woman touched. She 
thought that burning his things would 
teach him about commitment. Yet Kate 
solved few problems in her relationship. 
Her boyfriend still attempts to rationalize 
his behavior and views the bonfire as the 
penalty for his indiscretion. He feels ev
erything should go back to normal. She 
still is unsatisfied and resentful.
The energy spent in teaching someone 
a lesson could be utilized in finding 
someone new. If you attempt to make 
the cheaters life miserable or to teach 
him or her a lesson, you need to get a life. 
Making someone burn their belongings 
wont make you wanted. I could never 
touch a woman if I were in a committed 
relationship with her and knew she 
cheated on me. It would make me physi
cally and mentally ill. However, it would 
also disgust me if I cheated and the 
female took me back.
Any relationship worth being a part of 
is based on honesty, loyalty, and trust. 
When these terms are violated, its no 
longer a committed relationship. Often, 
its easier to take the cheating partner 
back than face your own insecurities and 
shortcomings. In the end, this leads to a 
cycle of destruction. Allowing the person 
to re-enter the relationship after cheat
ing is saying you lack all self-respect. It 
will always be in the back of his or her 
mind that you didnt possess the selfrespect to end the relationship.The bot
tom line is that accepting infidelity is 
pathetic, whether one is a celebrity, a 
politician, or an average person.

H&SS. He welcomes all responsible re
plies to his column.

The other two competitions are epee and

handle is more enclosed, and the rules of 
combat change slightly.
The United States Fencing Associa

.
Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Co-Editor 
A Tartan fencer attacks an opponent last Saturday.
all over the country. Every fencer is 
ranked either A, B, C, D, E, or U for 
unranked. A and B rankings are the 
highest rankings and are comprised of 
national-level fencers. To give an idea 
of the level of competition, the Holy 
Grail Championships at Carnegie 
Mellon was a local competition featur
ing fencers rated from C to E.
As for the event itself, 
Carnegie Mellon fielded 
two foil teams, one epee 
team and two sabre fenc
ers. The club is coached by 
Iana Dakova, who was once 
a member of the Bulgarian 
national womens team. 
We are quite privileged to 
have [Dakova], said fenc
ing club President junior 
J ason Rennie. Besides be
ing an excellent fencer, she 
is a superb coach, always 
willing to put forth great 
effort to ensure that the 
members of our club learn 
the ins and outs of the fenc
ing as well as possible. 
The Tartans finished in 
the middle of the pack in 
the foil and epee events. 
CMU Red finished fifth out 
of 10 in the foil event and 
CMU Black came in sixth.
We did fairly well for 
the level of the competi
tion that was at the tour
nament, said Rennie. The 
teams that won the foil, 
epee and sabre events were 
on par with what you might
expect from a decent collegiate varsity 
team. The overall level of competition 
was quite a bit higher than I expected; 
much higher than we saw in last years 
Holy Grail Championships.
According to Rennie, the foil teams did 
quite well given their level of experi
ence. Most of the foilers had less than 
six months of experience, and all of the 
teams that placed higher than fifth were 
composed of fencers with numerous years 
of experience.
The best Carnegie Mellon finish of the 
day went to the mixed epee fencers who 
finished third behind Penn State and IUP.
I was quite happy to see our epee team 
take third place in the competition, said 
Rennie. The three who made up our 
team had all fenced epee seriously before 
coming to CMU, but have not had much 
practice during the school year.
The sabre fencers were paired up with 
others from West Virginia University 
(WV) and Worcester. The WV team place 
first overall in sabre; the Worcester squad 
finished second.
The Holy Grail Championships is one 
of two events that CMU fencing hosts 
every year. Besides that, they practice 
three times a week and usually send 
fencers to three or four other local com
petitions throughout the year.
The CMU Fencing club is always look
ing for new members. To join, either email fencing@andrew.cmu.edu or drop 
by one of the practices. The team prac
tices Tuesday nights at 6:30 pm and 
Thursday nights at 8pm in the fencing 
room, third floor of Skibo Gym. There is 
also a weekly Saturday practice at 2pm 
in Thistle Hall of Skibo Gym.

that enabled the Crusaders first

He is the best player on this team 
that knocked off a powerful Missis

coach at Valparaiso. Bryce decided 
being close to his home and father 
was more important to him than 
the national attention hed get 
playing at a school like Indiana. 
Now, in his senior year, he has led

The NCAA Tournament is a 
great event on the sports calenar. What provides for this great
ness is not the Final Four, not the

Arizonas who have been the fo

makes this event capture the 
magination of the athletic world

Its the first round that makes

lough you dont have the guts to

most compelling stories in the

iut off it as well.

ended that talk quickly, however, 
with the 70-69 upset.
The MVP of the game was defi

and had eight assists to go along 
with his highlight reel buzzer 
beater. The way that Drew ended

ing. Drew was Mr. Basketball in 
Indiana his senior year in high 
school and had coaches from the 
best basketball schools in the na
tion knocking at his door, includ
ing The General  Bobby Knight 
of Indiana. However, one coach 
had the inside track to Drews
been before  the second round of 
the NCAA tournament.
Another player who resisted the 
call of big-time basketball schools 
to stay close to home is the star of 
the St. Louis Billikens. He looks 
like any other precocious fresh
man star, with his explosive 
drives and sweet jump
ers propelled by tattoo 
covered arms. Im talk
ing about Larry Hughes; 
the sensational player 
who led St. Louis, a 10 
seed, to an upset of sev
enth-seeded U.Mass. in 
the first round.
Hughes scored 21 
points per game for the 
Billikens this season, 
causing speculation 
that he may opt for the 
NBA after this season. 
How did a team such, as St. Louis 
get such a talented player over 
teams such as Syracuse, Michi
gan, and Kansas? The reason 
had to do with heart, specifi
cally that of Justin Hughes, 
Larrys younger brother. Justin 
was born with a heart defect
transplant about a year ago at 
the age of eleven. Hughes says 
everything he does is for his 
brother, and he backed this up 
by signing with St. Louis in or
der to be close to him. St. Louis 
coach Charlie Spoonhour got a 
young man wise beyond his 19 
years, as well as an unbeliev
ably gifted athlete.
These are just two of the stories 
provided by the teams in the 
NCAA tournament. They are sto
ries that help you to feel good 
aboutsports, after ayearofLatrell 
Sprewell and the alleged report 
(which is contested) that an esti
mated 60 percent of NBA players 
use marijuana. Valparaiso and 
St. Louis will not make the Final 
Four; more than likely, they wont 
even make the Sweet 16. How
ever, they have already provided 
us with memories and lessons that 
will last beyond this tournament. 
They are what makes the NCAA 
tournament the best that sports 
has to offer.

Aside from the statistics and

This sentiment went beyond

CMU track team 
falls in UAA final
By MARSHALL WARFEILD
Dossier Literaiy Editor
Although the UAA indoor track 
finals took place in the Windy 
City last weekend, CMU came 
home with a little less wind in its 
sails. Not even two school record 
breakers, a national qualifier, and 
a first place shot putter could 
raise CMU above its second-tolast-place finish.
The record breaker was jun
ior Maureen McGranaghan. 
Her 10:20, fourth place finish 
in the 3k, broke a record she set 
three weeks earlier at Denison. 
This time, McGranaghan also 
qualified to run at Nationals.
It was a very fast race, signifi
cantly faster than in previous 
years. I placed fourth with a time 
that would have won my fresh
man year. We have several good 
distance runners in the confer
ence right now, and that makes 
for faster times across the board, 
said McGranaghan.
She also competed last week
end at the Nationals competi
tion. Her 5k time of 17:35:51 
gave her sixth-place, making her 
an indoor track All-American. 
This follows on the heels of her 
All-American achievement last 
year in the outdoor season.
Another CMU school 
womens record was broken by 
senior Jessica Connolly. She 
sprang to a fifth-place finish in 
the long jump, with a distance 
of 15' 6". She also placed sixth 
in the triple jump with 33' 4".
Freshman Matt Gustin crushed 
the competition with his shotput, 
throwing 43.65 feet for first place, 
I had worked pretty hard in the 
weight, room and coach Meckley 
had helped me with my form, 
said Gustin.
Highlights of the womens 
team focused around the distance 
runners. McGranaghan wasnt 
alone in the 3k  senior Melissa 
Lott finished right behind her 
with 10:23.
The 5k run featured a strong 
group of CMU women. Junior 
Margaret Powers and sophomore 
Andrea Bums finished third and 
fifth with 18:10 and 19:03. Sopho
more Elizabeth Currid finished 
sixth with 20:00.
The mens team also came away 
with some solid field events. Jun
ior Aaron Binkley and senior Pe
ter De La Cruz tied for fifth in the 
pole vault. First-year student 
Allen Ednie got third in the triple 
jump, and graduate student Jodi 
Rogish was close behind Gustin 
with fourth place in the shot put.
The mens 4x4 relay team, 
which finished third with 3:31, 
played the role of spoiler at the 
end of the meet. Since they ran in 
the slow heat, however, they were 
ignored by Wash U., who began 
prematurely celebrating an over
all first-place win. When the point 
totals came in, however, the Tar
tan mens third-place finish stole 
just enough points from Wash U. 
to give Rochester the top spot in 
the meet  Rochester had 97

Fencing club hosts tournament
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
This summer in theaters, one of 
the masked heroes of the 50s will 
be reincarnated when the swash
buckling Zorro moves into the 90s, 
markinghis enemies with his trade
mark Z and sending them to their 
tailors crying. This weekend CMUs 
own masked swordsmen took to 
Skibo Gym for the fencing clubs 
Holy Grail Championships.
Over 100 duelers from local fenc
ing clubs and regional universities, including Kent State, Indi
ana University of Pennsylvania 
(IUP), Worcester Polytechnical 
Institute, and Penn State com
peted in the annual event.
Fencing goes beyond the sta
tistics, though. It is a sport rich 
in culture and tradition and is 
the result of centuries of evolu
tion. Swordfighting as a sport 
has existed since the days of an
cient Egypt and has been prac
ticed in many forms and various 
cultures since then. Modemfencing owes much of its history to
the European Middle Ages and, 
more specifically, the 16th-century 
evolution of the rapier.
Todays sport has at least one 
fundamental contrast from the 
one of ancient times, however  
death and dismemberment at the 
hands of ones opponent are not 
common in todays duels. The 
games of yesteryear were often a 
means of settling disputes, and 
at least one of the'fighters would 
come away with fewer body parts 
than he went in with. Luckily (or 
unfortunately if you like that sort
of thing) threats of jail time and 
other such punishments for man
slaughter and assault in the 18th 
century helped to end fencings 
reputation as a blood sport.
Today the sport is much more 
refined and structured. There are 
three competitions which are 
based on the type of weapon used. 
Foil competition utilizes a thin, 
lightweight sword. The object is 
to poke the tip of the foil into the 
opponents torso. As in all forms 
of modern fencing, electric vests

Like nothing out of Star Wars, the Carnegie Mellon fencing club is for real. Last Saturday, it hosted the Holy Grail Championships.Athletic Department searches for womens soccer coach
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Earlier this semester, the nor
mally quiet off-season of fall 
sports was disrupted by the de
fection of Ann Haggerty, the 
Carnegie Mellon womens soccer 
coach. The three-year coach of 
the Tartans left for William 
Smith College to be an assistant 
coach. Haggerty played her col
lege soccer at William Smith 
College and was a three-time 
Division III All-American.
I was a little surprised. We 
didnt know it was going to hap
pen.... I was just unprepared, 
said junior goalie Lindsey Smith. 
The Athletic Department re
sponded quickly by naming John 
Sumoski as the interim coach. 
They have also started a national 
search for next years head coach. 
Sumoski has served as an assis
tant coach for CMU in 1995 and
this past year. The change, while 
sudden, was well-received by 
Smith. I think [Sumoskis] a 
great coach, she said. He moti
vates us, and thats what we need.f "-/im 
 '-i '
Nathan Steinwaid/Tartan Sports Co-Editor 
John Sumoski is the interim soccer 
coach for the womens team.
We have a lot of heart, and he 
brings that out.
The Athletic Department has 
signed Sumoski to a three-month 
contract that runs from Febru
ary to April, so that the team can 
train in the off-season.
Currently, the team is weight 
training two times a week and 
practicing indoors twice a 
week. In addition to that, 
Sumoski is working with play
ers in small groups so that he 
can instruct them directly on 
specific skills. They work very 
hard; they want to win, said 
Sumoski. I have them come in 
to work on shooting, and in an 
hour they can be shooting 10 
times better than when they 
[first] came in.
Sumoskis own involvement in 
soccer has depended heavily 
upon hard work. He entered col
lege unrecruited and, by his jun
ior year, was a Division II AllAmerican. In his senior year, he 
was an All-American again and 
was in the top 10 among scorers 
in the nation.
After college, he worked as a 
computer scientist, but over the 
last four years, he has been train
ing to recieve his A license, which 
is the highest level of national 
licensing available for soccer 
coaching. He has also worked with 
Adidas to learn coaching tech
niques which focus on technical 
skills in an attempt to improve 
the level of soccer played in the 
United States. Sumoski has 
coached on a number of levels, 
from young children to the Olym
pic Development Program.
Sumoski is currently one of ap
proximately 115 applicants for 
the permanent job of head coach 
for CMU. The Athletic Depart
ment has been conducting a na
tional search through the NCAA 
News, the primary tool for such
searches, to find a replacement 
by the end of April.
Until the selection is made, 
the team and Sumoski are pre
paring for next year. In addi
tion to the practices, Sumoski 
has been in charge of recruit
ing, one of the ways CMU hopes 
toimprove the soccer team. 
Last year, the team was able to 
bring in a strong first-year 
class, which may have as many 
as five or six players starting 
as sophomores.
Im having a lot of luck recruit
ing [this year], said Sumoski. 
The team has only signed two 
players, but one has been involved 
with the Olympic Development 
Program. I think I can win 
with this team.... If I get one 
good recruiting year we can do 
well in the UAA, said Sumoski.
For now, Sumoskis primary 
focus has become getting the 
top job at CMU. I like Pitts
burgh. Its a friendly campus, 
and right now, my main focus is 
on getting this job. According 
to him, he is currently a candi
date for about 30 other head 
coaching positions across the 
country, but would like to stay 
in Pittsburgh where he has been 
for the last several years.
The womens soccer season last 
fall is an indication of how diffi
cult it will be to perform well in 
the UAA, a conference which is 
traditionally strong. Last year, 
five teams in the UAA were 
ranked in the top 20 nationally. 
Through the whole season, the 
team played eight teams that 
were ranked. Carnegie Mellons 
record suffered from the tough 
competition, but a team that was 
young last year will be experi
enced next year. New recruits 
and the energy of a new coach 
should help to improve the team 
over the next few years.
Team unity results in positive outcome for U.S. Olympic hockey
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
Dear U.S. Olympic Hockey Team,
I am writing to you on behalf of fans, 
sportswriters, and hockey lovers every
where. Certain conduct by your teammates 
after the loss to the Czech Republic in the 
quarterfinals this February in Nagano was, 
indeed, improper. Broken chairs that were 
later thrown over the balcony, fire extin
guishers hurled through windows, and a 
dirty carpet  all in all, $3,000 in damage 
to your Olympic Village rooms.
It has, as you know, sparked quite a 
controversy. Some people wanted to ban 
all of the members of the team from 
future competition. Some wanted to fine 
you. The Commissioner of the NHL, 
Gary Bettman, wanted to suspend you 
all from regular season games.
But following a letter from your es
teemed captain, Chris Chelios, apolo

EXPLORE OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING 
Community offers varied options
Neil Babra/Tartan Art Staff
By JENNIFER TERRY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
With room draw on the hori
zon this week, a lot of students 
are considering their hous
ing options for next year, 
and many will choose to live 
in off-campus housing. Be
fore you decide to make that 
move, there are a lot of things 
to consider, such as cost, loca
tion, convenience, and 
whether or not you can 
handle the independence. 
Location is probably 
the least difficult thing 
youll have to worry 
about in considering offcampus housing. Most of the 
houses on Beeler Street are closer 
to campus than the Universityowned spaces in Cathedral Man
sions, Shirley Apartments, 
or Fairfax Apart
ments; they may
On-campus service 
aids off-campus living
even be closer to campus than 
Mudge House.
[Given the choice,] Id either 
live on Beeler or ... Forbes, said 
junior industrial management 
major David Crandall. But I like 
Beeler because there are no hills. 
There are apartments on Fifth 
Avenue in Oakland that are al
most as close. Even if you decide to 
move further away into Shadyside 
or Squirrel Hill, there are shuttles 
and buses that can take you to and 
from campus easily.
I like Walnut Street [in 
Shadyside] ... its a safe neigh
borhood, and the rent is cheaper 
[than Beeler or Forbes], said 
Matt Cuccaro, a senior civil en
gineering major. Its not too far 
of a walk, and TCBY is right 
around the corner.
What type of housingyou choose 
is another thing to consider. Dif
ferent types of accomodations each 
have their pros and cons, depend
ing on what youre looking for.
I think its better to deal with 
apartment buildings 
than to try
to rent a room in a house, said 
Brian Mendelssohn, a junior 
materials science and engineer
ing major. The apartment 
building [that I live in] is newer, 
and you have a permanent main
tenance guy to deal with prob
lems. It costs a little more, but 
its worth it. He added that his 
friends who rent rooms have 
trouble getting things fixed in 
good time because their land
lord has to take care of each 
problem individually.
An apartment didnt fit the pref
erences of sophomore business 
administration major Kim 
Worrilow, however. I think a 
house is the best option, she said. 
You dont have to deal with the 
noise from neighbors like in an 
apartment or townhouse. Like
wise, she said, you can be pretty 
noisy in a house and no one will 
come knocking on your door ask
ing you to quiet down.
Sophomore architecture ma
jor Kento Ohmori rents part of a 
townhouse with a friend. In con
sideration of his neighbors 
downstairs, he cant have big 
parties or turn the music up 
loud, but nevertheless he is 
happy with his accomodations.

When making the decision to move off 
campus, one of the first obstacles to over
come is finding a place to start the search 
for somewhere to live. Over the past ten 
years, Norma Shaw has developed the 
Community Housing Office from a steel 
box of index cards listing available apart
ments to a one-stop shop with all the 
information a prospective off-campus stu
dent might need  not just listings of 
apartments available for rent, but also 
shuttle information, tenants comments 
on landlords, and even catalogs to find 
furnishings for a living space.
Shaw, the coordinator of community 
housing in Housing Services, organizes 
all of this information based on what stu
dents have asked for in the past. When I 
came in, I began to list what [students] 
wanted and have built the answers that 
are [in the office], said Shaw. Anytime a 
question came up three times, I made it a 
point to write down the answer.
Upon entering her office and signing 
in, a visitor is presented with several
brochures containing general informa
tion and guidance for the search for an 
apartment off campus. Shaw said that 
familiarizing oneself with the answers to. 
common questions and knowing what to 
look for in an apartment will make the 
process much easier later on. This,infor
mation has also been made available on 
Housing Services Web site.
According to Shaw, one of the most 
important aspects of the search is to actu
ally see the space you are considering 
renting. As an example of why, she related 
the story of one female student who was 
promised an apartment in Shadyside over 
the phone. Her father had spoken with the 
landlord, and the deal sounded promis
ing, so he signed a lease and put down six 
months rent. Upon arriving at the apart
ment  which was actually in East Lib
erty  they found that a family of rac
coons had already moved in. Fortunately, 
the father and daughter won a court case 
to recover the lost money.
Dont take a place until youve ... 
seen it, said Shaw.-Turn on the shower, 
flush the toilet, and see what happens 
to the shower; make sure the locks are
secure, 
and that there 
are locks on the win
dows; check to see that the 
stairs are lighted.
Once familiar with the process and 
what to watch for in looking at a place to 
live, one has several options with which to 
approach the search itself. In addition to a 
database of available apartments, there is 
a cross-referenced telephone listing called 
Coles Directory which helps students con
tact other residents of a building they are 
considering. Coles lists city residents by 
address rather than by name, allowing 
the reader to look up current tenants of a 
given apartment complex. It also lists 
when each tenant moved in; Shaw says 
that a lot of new residents in a building 
may be indicative of a high turnover rate 
and perhaps a problematic landlord.
For legalreasons, Shaw herself is 
not permitted to give advice on where a 
student should live, but she does have

Resources ease transition to new home
By GREGORY NOFI
Tartan Staffwriter
When its time to live off campus, its time to say 
goodbye to false fire alarms, peculiar odors, and MEDPAT phones. Unfortunately, when you leave the dor
mitories, you also leave behind some conveniences. 
With careful planning, however, you can easily substi
tute for some of those dormitory services.
Even though you may live in an apartment, there are 
still several ways to organize your meals. If you want 
a meal plan, there are some different choices avail
able. In addition to the varying amounts of Dine 
Xpress that you can purchase, two meal plans are 
available at Highlander: five or seven meals per week. 
The Guide to Hospitality and Dining Services recom
mends the five-meal plan for off-campus students who 
only eat their lunch on campus.
But many off-campus students find meal plans to be 
inconvenient for breakfast and dinner. They prefer to 
eat those meals in their apartments.
Sometimes Ill be on campus, and Ill just eat 
lunch at the UC, said Jennifer Ragan, a senior 
psychology major who lives in Oakland. But for 
breakfast and dinner, I usually eat food that Ive 
bought at the grocery store. Also, since Im not on 
campus, Im more inclined to get fast food or go to 
restaurants in the area.
Fortunately, many students have found several res
taurants and stores in their neighborhoods where they 
can take care of this. But transportation to these 
places and school is another issue. Now that you are off
campus, places are no longer a short walk away. Most 
students who live in Oakland, Shadyside, and Squir
rel Hill have a 15 to 25-minute walk to campus every
day. Walking is not always convenient, however, espe
cially in cold or inclement weather. For these times, it 
is often favorable to catch a bus.
The PATransit buses can take you to and from areas 
in Oakland and Squirrel Hill. A monthly pass costs

Its Sunday night, and 
many CMU students are home 
doing work, or maybe watch
ing television, or checking 
email. But up at the City The
ater, senior drama major Erin 
Kirk is performing the role of 
a young writer. She puts all 
her emotion and intellect into 
her performance, garnering 
rave reviews all the while 
In Pittsburgh treated her role 
positively and called her per
formance intellectual.
Kirk won the role of Lisa 
Morrison at the City Theaterjust prior to winter break. She 
characterizes her achievement as some
what surprising, as the part was the 
result of her professional audition. 
Coupled with the fact that during her 
sophomore year, CMU faculty members 
suggested that Kirk change her major, 
the role is even more rewarding. If she 
has any regrets about not taking their 
advice, she doesnt show it as she pre
pares for a three-week stint as a profes
sional actress. And judging from the 
reviews shes been receiving, this is the 
first of a great many to come.

ries about?
Erin Kirk: Its about the teacher-student relationship, and through the play, 
through six years, we grow to become

friends, and it becomes a more motherdaughter relationship. [The characters 
are] both creative writers  shes a 
famous writer whom I admire. While 
we get close, my book becomes pub
lished, and its well-received; then I
I was in a little kids 
musical theater com
pany, and I just never 
stopped. It started prob
ably from the astound
ing success of my sixth 
grade variety show.
TT: Have you been 
in other acting media, 
like television?
EK: No. I did plays in 
high school and plays 
here and studied with 
some acting coaches in 
high school. Collected 
Stories was my first 
professional audition, 
which is ironic because 
I never thought it was 
supposed to happen 
that easily. I thought I was going to have 
to struggle. I mean, not that I wont have 
to struggle, but it just kind of happened 
conveniently, and easily.
TT: Do you have goals for the future? 
EK: Im going to move to New York
take her personal stories that she shared and try to pursue acting there.... I really
with me and put them into a novel, and 
it gets published. [The audience] is kind 
of stuck at the end, deciding whether or 
not what I did is justified, or whether to 
follow her path, because shes totally 
emotionally destroyed by what I did.
TT: Did you ever think you would 
study something else? How early did 
you know you might have a talent for 
performing on-stage?
EK: I went to L.A. County High School 
for the Arts. Early on in elementary school,
want to do theatre.... Theres just so 
much more integrity in the stage to me 
right now.... Ultimately, Id like to be in 
movies, I think. Because I do love the 
medium and there is brilliant work that 
goes on there. Id like to be making, 
writing, or directing movies.
TT: What do you think about the School 
of Drama? Has it helped you to develop 
for your professional life as an actor?
EK: Yes, it has. Ive gone through my 
ups and downs at this school. I almost got
cut my sophomore year. Ive gone through 
my time really hating this school, but in 
the end, I think it has taught me a tre
mendous amount. The teachers dont al
ways agree with each other in terms of 
acting methods and styles of teaching, 
which can sometimes be confusing to a 
student. But in the end, thats what pre
pares you best. You dont come out of here 
as a certain type of actor, you can prepare 
all sorts of processes and methods.
TT: What is the process of getting cut?
EK: Basically youhave conferences with 
teachers at the end of each term, and they 
keep you up-to-date on how they think 
youre doing. My conferences hadnt been 
going well; I had been told that I was too 
intellectual of an actor. It was suggested 
to me that I switch into the directing 
major ... I was told that it was the ex
pressed opinion of a faculty member that 
I wasnt marketable, and didnt have a 
career path ahead of me because of that.
TT: How did you react to that?
EK: I was very, very upset. But I knew 
it could either sink me or I could rise 
above it, and I think that it did a good 
thing; it just enlivened my emotional life 
so much. I was able to bring that to my 
acting. So my final scenes were success
ful and good and full of emotion, and they 
saw that I was capable of that full emo
tional life, and that I could stay here. I 
mean, in the end, Im glad it happened. It 
gives me a feeling that Ive traveled to a 
really far place in this school.

Study abroad award winner looks toward Africa
By SHARMILA VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
While most biology majors might know 
if they plan to attend medical school 
after college, they rarely know what 
kind of medicine they will study or where 
they will even apply. But Margie Lalonde 
is a little different  shes done her 
research. In fact, she already knows 
that in her third year of medical school, 
she will be offered two electives which 
she will use to study the health care 
issues of women in Africa.
This summer, shell get a jump start 
on her plans. As winner of the 1998 Vira 
I. Heinz Study Abroad Award, Lalonde, 
a junior biology and English double 
major, will spend nine weeks in Kenya, 
teaching either biology or English to 
secondary school students who live in 
villages. Ill basically be there to relieve 
overworked teachers, so Im willing to 
teach any subject needed, she said.
Each year, the Vira I. Heinz Endow
ment awards one junior woman $4,000 to 
study abroad, choosing winners based on 
their proposed plan of travel and study 
and also how well they express their 
intentions. Each applicant must submit, 
through interviews and an essay, where 
they plan to go and what they plan to 
study during their time abroad.
It was a tough selection this year, but 
Margie had a very clear application with a 
strong focus  she seemed really impas
sioned about her ideas, said Eva Mergner,
the study abroad advisor in the Office of 
International Education. Her plans also 
seemed really relevant to her future. 
While teaching isnt necessarily part 
of Lalondes future plans, shes a strong 
believer in a good education. Education 
is the only means of advancement for 
people from undeveloped countries, she 
said. If these children do well on na
tional exams, they have the chance to 
attend [college]. Otherwise they will farm 
as their parents do.
Kenya and other countries need edu
cated children to eventually help their 
country. I felt this was my opportunity 
to help these children reach their poten
tial and at the same time expose myself 
to a broader background, she said.
Lalonde hopes to use her background 
in science to help improve heath care 
conditions in Africa. I know that in 
Africa, AIDS and malaria are problems 
right now, she said. I want to know 
what its like to live there, in terms of 
the health resources they have. What do 
they need?
She also plans to work on an indepen
dent research project through the En
glish Department. Her project will focus 
on the situation of women in Africa. 
While in Kenya, Lalonde will work with 
womens organizations to explore the 
pressing health care issues that African 
women face and also what kind of career 
opportunities they have.
Ive been reading books by Kenyan 
authors on the role of women in African
society, said Lalonde. I know 
polygamy isnt a big thing there 
anymore, but men do still have 
more than one wife. How does this 
affect the role of women in the 
family? How does it affect mother
hood? There isnt much equality.
Applicants for the Vira I. Heinz 
award must submit a budget for 
their trip, but it is rarely moni
tored, said Mergner. Margie 
might get $5,000 because shes 
going a little further than most 
applicants plan to do, she said.
Without having to worry about 
financing her stay, Lalonde will 
be able to focus on her main goal: 
to immerse herself in another cul
ture. I really think this award 
provides a great opportunity for 
young women to explore some
thing that otherwise they might 
not have been able to for financial 
reasons, she said.
Lalonde said she wasnt inter
ested in traveling to Kenya spe
cifically (where Global Routes 
program is located), but to any 
African country. Kenya has a 
more developed infrastructure, 
and a democratic government, which 
is good, she said. I wouldnt want to 
go to a place in the middle of civil war, 
like Zaire, for example.
I had someone suggest that I travel... 
to Africa independently, without some 
sort of program, Lalonde said. I said, I
Lalonde will spend a semester teaching in Africa.
dont think so. The African government 
is so corrupt.... Its good to have the 
protection of an outside group to help 
you if you have any problems.
Above all, Lalonde mainly wants the 
opportunity to explore another culture, 
even if only for the summer.

Community Housing also pro
vides a roommate matching ser
vice that potential off-campus stu
dents can use to find someone 
with whom to split the cost of an 
apartment. This service has grown
in the past two years into a world
wide, online service with which 
anyone can find a roommate.
Prior to this [service], people 
would just come in and leave, miss
ing the chance to get together, 
said Shaw. What would often hap
pen, she said, is that a student 
would come in looking for a room
mate, not find anyone who fit their
needs, and leave. Five minutes 
later, someone else who mighthave 
been a good match would come in.
The online aspect of the service 
allows graduate students to ar
range roommate matches prior to 
coming to campus in August, when 
they would only have about three 
days to find a roommate and a 
place to live and move in. Stu
dents have told Shaw that the 
service is the only one of its kind in 
the world, and that it is used by 
people outside CMU as well.
Someone in India got together 
with someone in Japan [via the

going to school in Atlanta.
One can also find information

until late at night. Unfortunately, it may 
be hard to take a bus to some areas of 
Shadyside since the bus routes go in and 
out of downtown Pittsburgh.
If you live relatively close to campus, 
however, you can take the free CMU 
shuttle that services all of the apart
ments offered by Housing Services and 
their surrounding areas. The shuttle 
runs between 6:45 am and 10:45 pm. All 
shuttles leave Morewood Gardens 15 
and 45 minutes after the hour.
When I dont like walking late at night, 
I find the shuttle to be very convenient, 
said Katherine Dresler, a first-year mu
sic student who lives in Oakland.
If you need a ride after 10:45 pm, you 
can call the Escort Service to come and 
drive you where you need to go. The 
number for information or Escort dis
patch is x8-RIDE.
For weekend trips to the supermar
ket, many students take the Tartan 
Express. This service provides a free bus 
ride to Squirrel Hill, Edgewood Town 
Center, and the Monroeville Mall every 
Saturday. Your student ID is required to 
use any of these services.
The [Tartan Express] is a good mode 
of transportation to go food shopping 
since you dont have to walk all the way 
back to your apartment with bags of 
groceries, said Jennifer Church, assis
tant to the Dean of Student Affairs.
Many students own cars and find 
that off-campus parking can be an is
sue sometimes. The consensus among 
residents is that Oakland is the hard
est place to find parking.
We have a lighted parking lot right 
next to our building, but it is expensive 
to park there, said Ragan. Street park
ing costs about $20 a year, but it is not 
always guaranteed.
In Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, how
ever, street parking is a lot easier to 
find. On a crowded day, the farthest 
you will have to park is two blocks 
away, said Roger Wei, a freshman de
sign major and Shadyside resident.
Finally, if you need help with any
thing else concerning your off-campus 
apartment, you can speak with Norma 
Shaw, the Community Housing coordi

aiding current apartment dwellers.
[My office] has been custom-made for 
students and their needs, said Shaw. If 
students get into trouble with their land
lords, they can come in to discuss what 
went wrong.... I also have furniture cata
logs and many other resources a student 
may need while living off-campus.
Shaw is an excellent starting place to 
get information about off-campus ser
vices. You do not need an appointment 
to speak with her. Students who would 
like to speak with her in the Housing 
Services Office at Morewood E-110 can 
just walk in at any time during the day.
Taking care of all of these needs may 
seem challenging, but for many students, 
this soon becomes a routine task. This 
kind of management may prove to be 
even more helpful after graduation when 
you find yourself living on your own.

OPTIONS, from page LI
I enjoy it a lot, he said. Im sure 
it all depends on your lifestyle. If you 
like having your own space its great.... 
Id personally never trade it.
For many students, another im
portant advantage of living off-campus is the cost. If you shop around 
long enough, and especially if you 
plan on rooming with several other 
people, its often considerably cheaper 
to live off campus, even when includ
ing utility payments.
Ive got this big apartment all 
to myself, with my own kitchen 
and bathroom, and its costing me 
less than living on campus would, 
said Mendelssohn.
However, you do have to consider 
the fact, that you (or your parents) 
have to make monthly rental and 
utility payments, rather than pay
ing for housing just once a semester. 
If you have trouble making a pay
ment to your account with the Uni
versity, and there is a good reason, a 
grace period is usually allowed. A 
landlord is less forgiving: If you dont 
pay, you get evicted.
Another issue many off-campus 
residents face for the first time is 
that of increased responsibility. Be
sides monthly payments, you gener
ally buy and cook your own food. 
Also, rather than a friendly RA who 
reminds you nicely about quiet hours, 
you have angry neighbors or land
lords breathing down your neck when 
youre keeping them awake.
Even without the associated issues, 
the decision to leave the dorm is a big 
one for many students, and it is a 
decision that is made for a variety of 
reasons. Worrilow, a transfer stu

dent, couldnt be guaranteed on-campus housing, so the decision to live 
off campus was easy for her. For 
Mendelssohn, who stays in Pitts
burgh over breaks, theres no hassle 
with getting stuff out by a certain 
day in December or May, because he 
can stay as long as he wants.
Weigh your options first. Once 
you sign that lease, youre stuck 
with it, said Ohmori. With on-campus housing, you only risk losing a 
$200 deposit if you change your 
mind. If you change your mind with 
off-campus housing and youve al
ready signed a lease, you will need a 
lawyer to recover your investment.
The bottom line is that there are a 
lot of advantages to living off campus, 
but you have to make sure youre ready 
for it first. If youve already decided 
you are, happy house-hunting!

L4The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  16 March 1998
Club brings Objectivist philosophy to CMU community
By SHEILA FLANAGAN
Tartan Staffwriter
' Dr. Andrew Bernstein stood before a 
large and seemingly eager audience 
last Wednesday night in Wean Hall 
7500 and managed to give an overview 
of Ayn Rands philosophy of Objectiv
ism in just under two hours.
"You have to understand that I usu
ally take five hours to do this presenta
tion when Im at conferences, said 
Bernstein, professor of philosophy at 
Marymount College and an expert on 
Objectivism. But tonight Im going to 
try to cut it down to about two [hours]. 
Following the lecture, the audience 
had the opportunity to question and, 
{in some cases, attack Bernsteins ar
guments in an extended question and 
answer period.
1 Bernstein, whose lecture was spon
sored by the CMU Objectivist Club, 
began his talk by laying out the main 
theme for the evening, which is also 
(One of the main tenets of the philoso
phy of Objectivism: Happiness as the 
result of achieving rational values is, 
according to Ayn Rand, the meaning of 
aife, said Bernstein.
[ Rand was born in Russia in 1905 and 
came to America at the age of 21. She is 
[the author of The Fountainhead, which 
[was first published in 1943, and Atlas 
[Shrugged, which was published in 1957. 
According to the information provided 
by the Ayn Rand Institutes Web site, 
Rand described her philosophy of Objec
tivism as an integrated system of 
[thought that defines the abstract prin
ciples by which a man must think and 
act if he is to live the life proper to man. 
The present CMU Objectivist Club 
was founded in the fall of 1997 by Jason 
Crawford, a freshman computer science 
major, and Tobin Coziahr, a sophomore
double major in electrical and computer 
engineering and business administra
tion. They founded the club with the 
purpose of spreading awareness of Ob
jectivism and studying the philosophy 
with others who are interested. They 
accomplish these goals through regular 
meetings, lectures, films, and the avail
ability of a lending library.
Most current members of the club 
joined following the F all Activities Fair.
portant to you they impel you to go 
directfly into] action to work for them, 
to get them, and to keep them.
Bernstein also said that values are 
important to an individual selfishly, 
and he defined selfish in the Objectiv
ist sense as the ability to hold lifepromoting values that will bring you to 
prosperous life.
He defined rationality as the sole 
means of achieving values. Man is a
With technology; with science, with reason, 
you can move mountains ... not with faith.
You can die by faith, but you cant live by it.  
 Andrew Bernstein, professor of philosophy,
Marymount College
While Crawford and Coziahr person
ally believe in the principles of Objec
tivism and try to follow them in their 
own lives, they explained that there 
are both people who personally believe 
in the philosophy and people who are 
simply interested in learning more 
about Objectivism in the club.
We have people who have questions or 
misconceptions, and we try to clear those 
up at our meetings, said Coziahr. No 
one comes for any malicious intent.... Its 
just been a place for open opinions.
Bernsteins lecture was divided into 
three sections: values, rationality, and 
capitalism. He used his own anecdotes 
as well as passages from Rands novels 
to illustrate his arguments.
The essence of... Rands heroes and 
heroines is to burn with passion for 
values, said Bernstein. Values are 
those things that to you have great 
worth ... those things that are so im
fragile creature, he said. Obviously, 
the survival tool with which man is 
equipped is his mind.
In expanding on this point, Bernstein 
presented Bill Gates as an example of 
someone who uses his mind to advance his 
own cause in life, and Mother Teresa as an 
individual whose life work was worthless 
because she embodied altruism.
Mother Teresas contribution was 
worth zilch, said Bernstein. With 
technology, with science, with reason, 
you can move mountains ... not with 
faith. You can die by faith, but you 
cant live by it, said Bernstein.
During the question and answer pe
riod, a student argued that Mother 
Teresa has made a contribution to the 
world because she helped people who 
otherwise may have died in poverty 
and who have instead had the opportu
nity to go out into the world and use 
their minds to succeed.
Bernstein responded: Mother 
Teresa [was] evil.... She is an 
affront to mankind because she 
stands for Christianity which to 
me is an evil code. He also added 
that people like Mother Teresa 
took money away from produc
tive enterprises by making 
people like Bill Gates feel guilty.
He further emphasized his 
point by slamming repeatedly 
on the lectern and yelling, And 
that is why I say Bill Gates is a 
hero, and Mother Teresa is a 
pig. Following his response, 
several audience members left 
the room laughing.
I think the biggest problem 
with people who speak about Objectivismisthattheydontpresent 
it well, said Eric Van Inwegen, a 
sophomore chemistry major and 
member of the CMU Objectivist 
Club. They get lost in a few par
ticular facts, which I think hap
pened here tonight.
In the final section of his lec
ture, Bernstein stressed that 
capitalism is the social condi
tion which is necessary for the 
rational mind to flourish.
The rational thinker must be left free 
not only to think, but to act on his own 
best judgment, he said. We need the 
state to protect us from criminals, but

The government is a much more danger
ous source of violating our rights.
Dr. Bernstein is an impassioned 
speaker, [and I think we saw that here 
tonight], said Crawford. I think he 
gave a good presentation of the basics 
of the philosophy.
Crawford and Coziahr hope to expand 
the Objectivist Clubs activities in the

a meeting, or checking out books 
by Ayn Rand or other Objectivist au
thors, you can contact the club at

What has happened to Saturday morning cartoons? It 
used to be that you could sit yourself down in front of the 
television with a bowlful of your favorite sugar-laced cereal 
early in the morning, and watch until mid-afternoon. Id

Chicago, where he completed his Ph.D. under Enrico Fermi. He held 
research positions at the University of Chicago, the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton 
before joining Columbia University in 1953, where he is now Enrico 
Fermi Professor of Physics and University Professor.
In 1957, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics (with C.N. Yang) for the 
discovery of parity and charge-conjugatlon symmetry violations in weak 
interactions. From the late 40s onward he made many other basic con
tributions to the theory of weak interactions and to particle physics 
generally.
In recent years, T.D. Lee has played an important role in fostering phys
ics research and education in China, particularly as director of the China 
Center of Advanced Science and Technology (CCAST) and the Beijing 
Institute of Modern Physics (BIMP). In 1997, he became director of the 
RIKEN BNL Research Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory, funded 
by the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research of Japan.
This Iccture is funded under die auspices of die Buhl Professorship in Theoretical Phys
ics, which was established at Carnegie Mellon in 1961 by The Buhl Foundation in sup
port of an outstanding theoretical scientist who would both impact dieoretical research 
and help establish directions for experimental investigations.__________________________

ODYSSEY THROUGH 
Morr UPDATES TALE
By RYAN DONOVAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
The musicians took the stage, 
and the crowd hushed. They 
came to play, mostly profes
sionally dressed, but, to set the 
unpredictable mood for the 
show, one of the drummers took 
his place wearing a tie-dye tshirt and a poofy rainbow wig. 
And thus the performance be
gan, its. passage a tribute to 
both Homer and John Coltrane.
A couple hundred students 
crowded into Rangos Hall last 
Wednesday for a performance 
that retold Homers Odyssey 
with a combination of jazz, dra
matic movement, and artistic 
slides. Ulysses Runs the Voo
doo Down was performed as 
part of the Wats:on? Festival of 
the Arts, but was created and 
executed by students within all 
disciplines of CFA, as well as 
students outside of CFA.
Tyrone Mitchell, a sophomore 
drama major who played 
Odysseus in the show, said the 
performance brought all the 
different people together, which 
was what Jill Watson was all 
about. But the show wasnt 
designed especially for the fes
tival. Director/creator of the 
Jazz Odyssey, Russell Kaplan, 
a sophomore drama major, cre
ated the show as an indepen
dent project.
I knew I wanted to do a show 
about jazz, reflecting the improvisational and exploratory 
qualities, and I thought The 
Odyssey would make a good ve
hicle for that, said Kaplan. The 
performance was already a 
multimedia experience incor
porating art, design, music, and 
drama, so when the Watsion? 
Festival rolled around, Kaplan 
thought it would be ideal to 
incorporate it in the festival.
The story of The Odyssey is 
retold in a swinging, updated 
way. The costumes hearken

back to big band era garb, with 
jazzy dresses and zooty suits. 
Mitchell, as Odysseus, the only 
actor not to play multiple roles, 
wears a Love Boa-ish captains 
suit throughout the show. And 
what can I say about the dresses 
the ladies wore? Yow! Help me!
The story was modernized a 
bit, with Odysseus crew named 
after pop culture icons. Instead of 
lotus eaters, as the original story 
called for, this production substi
tuted pot smokers. And when 
Odysseus went into Hades, it was 
the world of shades .(which 
means everyone wore sunglasses) 
and he breathed in the sweet 
aroma of chillness (which means 
everyone there was dressed like 
beat poets, acting much cooler 
than you or I could dream to be).
I really enjoyed the way they 
fused the music with the story, 
said Patrick Conlin, a senior cre
ative writing major. For many 
people, the addition of the jazz 
was what made this a special 
event. This is not to say that
other parts of the show lacked 
anything  they didnt  but 
the introduction of jazz into this 
familial* story created an expe
rience that dazzled. The musi
cal numbers covered a huge va
riety of artists, with numbers 
written by Dizzy Gillespie, Duke 
Ellington, Maceo Parker, 
Medeski Martin & Wood, and 
even Sun Ra, along with a slew 
of others.
Conductor/pianist Adam 
Waite, a sophomore music com
position major, led the jazz band, 
whose members came from var
ied disciplines in CMU. Of the 
two drummers, one is a design 
major, and the other is an ECE 
major. For Waite, this show truly 
was in the spirit of the Wats:on? 
Festival, as it brought people 
from all points in CFA and be
yond together for one afternoon.
I definitely learned a lot, 
said Waite. Its great when ev
erybody comes together on a 
project, and it comes together 
so well.

Cooperation and interrelation 
were the keywords at the show 
that opened at The Frame Gal
lery last Friday. The show, called 
Interspatiality, was held in con
junction with the Wats:on Festi

Watsons ideas. Intespatialityis 
the idea that no one area is a 
completely independent theory. 
It touches other topics that are 
social, aesthetic, cultural, and 
psychological, said curator

STUDENTS HOPE TO EXPOSE
By LISETTE MILLER-DIXON
Tartan Darkroom Manager 
& ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
From minimalist artists to storytell
ers, clowns, and jugglers, the visiting 
speakers and performers at this years 
Watsron? Festival provided students a 
chance to explore facets of art that they 
might not see otherwise. The events of 
the Festival embodied Jill Watsons ideas 
of creating a commonality between ar
tistic disciplines.
Mel Bochner, a graduate of Carnegie 
Tech, gave a speech tracing his work and 
how it has been received. This posed the 
questions of what is considered art and 
of where artistic boundaries fall.
Before he graduated, Bochners work 
had already come under criticism as 
not being art. His senior project, as
signed by Robert Leaper, one of 
Bochners greatest influences, was a
report that he thumb-tacked to the wall 
and labled as art.
During the years that his lecture fo
cused on, 1966-73, he continued to 
stretch the boundaries of art. A project 
that he displayed at the School of Visual 
Arts in New York City consisted of pho
tocopies of working drawings from other 
artists of all disciplines. This type of 
representation of other peoples art has 
marked a number of his projects and 
continues to draw criticism. At the time 
this was revolutionary, but it has be
come increasingly acceptable in the eyes 
of the art community.
Bochners work has continued to force 
a dialogue on the boundies of art, and 
this dialogue has extended into other 
disciplines. He shies away from direct 
comparisons, but the spirit of pursuing 
ideas and forms of expression that are 
not considered appropriate by some has 
created room for the exploration of these 
ideas in other realms.
I think the reason that 
Mel Bochner is here is be
cause he is a thinker and a 
doer, said Elaine King, an 
art history professor. Dur
ing the past three decades, 
[he] has questioned 
minimalism and post-ex
pressionism.... His art is 
about investigations. 
Other performers, such 
as storyteller Jackie Jonas, 
allowed students to con
sider art in a spoken form, 
before the idea of separate 
disciplines pervaded the art 
world. In her performance 
last Wednesday afternoon, 
Jonas told stories accom
panied by traditional Afri
can drums. Her stories, 
handed down by word of 
mouth, were mainly

Symphony shows 
musical prowess
By BLAKE ENGEL
TartanAsst. Production Manager
The Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra stretched its musi
cal muscles before a large audi
ence Friday night at I-Ieinz Hall, 
where Andr Previn conducted 
. Mozarts 25th symphony.
In the lineup for the evening 
was Waltons Concerto for Cello 
and Orchestra, featuring the 
PSOs own Anne Williams, and 
RaveYsAlborada del Gracioso, 
and a mystery piece (whose 
title, Debussys Prelude to the 
Afternoon of a Fawn, was not 
revealed on this evening; only 
that it was composed in 1892).
The evening began with the 
mystery piece, whose enigmatic 
style, portrayed with a recur
ring flute solo, paralled with 
the other pieces on the pro
gram. The flute solo eventually 
gave way to a woodwind cho
rus, which contrasted with the 
more jovial string accompani
ment. The woodwind and string 
sections meshed wonderfully 
among themselves and with 
each other.
Moving to a more upbeat se
lection, the orchestra performed 
Mozarts 25th symphony, best 
known for its use in the film 
Amadeus. The symphony is a 
far cry from the banality of 
Mozarts other symphonies, but 
its originality allowed it to blend 
well with the rest of the pro
gram. The orchestra rendered 
each nuance impeccibly, from 
the soaring horn lines in the 
first movement (thanks to the 
four horns in this score, as op
posed to Mozarts normal two), 
to the hypnotizing bassoon solo 
in the second movement. The 
violin section played out the 
hard-hitting entrances to their 
fullest in the first movement.
For the first time all evening, 
the pace became relaxed with 
the second movement. This 
movement uses a waltz style 
embedded in 4/4 and longer 
melodic lines that are echoed 
in the fourth movement. Yet 
another new style for the 
evening was a woodwind octet 
in the third movement. This 
octet, despite the lack of
strings, maintained a clear 
Mozart style. The ensemble 
demonstrated their astound
ing flexibility in the fourth 
movement, the one most typi
cal of Mozarts compositions.
Momentum was promptly 
regrained after the intermission 
as Anne Williams, principal cel
list in the PSO and faculty at 
Carnegie Mellon, took the stage 
for a phenomenal performance 
of Waltons Concerto for Cello 
and Orchestra.
The piece called upon Will
iams to blend in and out of the 
ensemble, which she did mas
terfully. The first movement was 
very wavelike in its pattern, and 
the orchestra very aptly carried 
it between these highs and lows. 
The second movement began 
with a flourish and Williams 
digging deep with fury and in
tensity, matching that of the 
brass, who finally had a promi
nent partin this movement. Wil
liams bravura performance, as 
well as the ensembles, earned a 
much-deserved extended round 
of applause.
Ravels Alborada del Gracioso 
provided an appropriate end
ing to an evening of varying and 
complementary music. .The 
piece was intense, with a grip 
on the audience that took hold 
early and didnt let go until the 
triumphant full-orchestra ma
jor arpeggio abruptly dropped 
the audience back in their seats. 
The flute and trumpet began 
the piece with a barrage of six
teenth notes which built pres
sure as they recurred through
out the piece. Spanish melodies 
and rhythms earned through 
in each of the movements, add
ing distinctive character to 
them. The finale began with 
chaos but wrapped up the en
tire concert with a bow and a 
card signed Love, the Trom
bone Section.
The PSO will begin their 
Russian Festival on March 20- 
22, featuring pieces by 
Slonimsky, Rachmaninoff, and 
Rimsky-Korsakov. The festival 
continues on March26-28 with 
Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, 
and Schnittke.
Play proves watchable despite flaws
By JEREMY LEWIT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The highlight of my evening 
at the Pittsburgh Public The
atre: a pretentious character in 
A Funny Thing Happened on 
the Way to the Forum in line for 
the bathroom telling his buddy 
how he performed this in Medi
cal School, and Oh, could you 
just imagine that ah-ha-ha. 
Now thats comedy.
Forum is a masterfully funny 
play. The production at the Pitts
burgh Public, however, is funny 
at times but delivers mostly in a 
lackluster jello-mold of fuzzy 
blocking and weak actor focus 
that congeals around the comedy 
and rolls over it. It leaves the 
audience flat for long stretches 
between the easy jokes.
Ted Pappas, who directed a 
brilliant production of Falsettos 
at the Public last year, directs a 
difficult piece to stage on the 
Publics three-quarter thrust 
stage: a big, showy comedy.
One of the joys of working at 
Pittsburgh Public Theater is the 
uniqueness of the auditorium. It 
brings the audience very close to 
the actors and to the action, said 
Pappas in a press release, who had 
to work slapstick, sight gag, and 
segue for an audience demanding 
a three-way focus, up close.
The bright set (reminiscent of 
Disneysiiercwfes), along with the 
colorful costumes that the Public
managed to get straight from 
the Broadway production, cre
ates the purposely artificial 
tone that Forums style re
quires. Although the entire cast 
has good presence on the set, 
many actors lack the focus, 
motion, and attention of the 
full, vibrant characters called 
for in the script. The characters 
leave behind great gags by not 
being big enough, not giving 
each line its moment (includ
ing one of my favorites: But 
being a man of conquest, his 
heart was set on a virgin.)
Pseudolus (Avery Saltzman), 
the main character, who does 
a strait imitation of Nathan 
Lanes voice, doesnt fill up the 
stage or his character. He re
fuses decisions and concentra
tion on his moments. He 
doesnt have the necessary 
nimble force and quick focus. 
He shrank from the self-con
scious nature of the character.
Pappas is working on a diffi
cult stage, but the script and 
Stephen Sondheims music pro
vide plenty of opportunity for 
more interesting, detailed block
ing that would support quicker, 
more energetic comedy. The slap
stick of the second act, full of 
classic door slams, pratfalls, and 
chase scenes, really suffers. 
Theres no focus, no handing off 
of energy between bits.
The cast provides great 
strength vocally to a tough score,

A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum plays until April 11th.
even if doesnt seem so, 
Sondheims music always is. 
Some numbers have great chore
ography, such as Everybody 
Ought To Have a Maid. They cut 
one of my favorite numbers, 
Pretty Little Picture, but 
Pseudolus has enough difficulty 
with Comedy Tonight, which 
also falls flat with weak staging.
Since its the opening number, it 
needs more jazz and pizzazz.
All in all, the show is still hilari
ous, and at the student ticket price 
of $ 10, Id still recommend seeing

Peter Coffin used sound, film,

As the program notes read, all 
of the projects on view at The

how the design of [a] setting has 
a deep and persisting influence 
on the people of that setting. For 
example, junior architects Eric 
Malo and Helena Broad and 
sophomore art major Rachel 
Matthews created an architec
tural structure that redefined the 
space within the gallery and thus 
affected the viewers of the show.

Dematera originally placed a 
CMU-wide request for proposals 
for works incorporating Watsons 
ideas. A jury of CFA faculty se
lected six projects to become part 
of the show, many of which hap
pened to be collaborations berelated thematically and visually. 
A student architecture contest also 
held last week as part of the festival 
involved close collaborationbetween 
groups of artists. The contest re
quired students to work in groups of 
fourorfivetobuildinstallation pieces
using concrete blocks, glass, and 
bricks donated by the International 
Masonry Institute, the Western

and Friday Masonry. On March 
18th, the winning group will re

We dont normally get to

said sophomore architecture 
major Christina Nargi. We 
usually have to design through 
drawing and models only. You 
dont really get the same un
derstanding as when youre 
working with actual building 
materials.
While the architecture contest 
demonstrated what one disci
pline can achieve, The Frame 
show provided a blueprint for 
what different artistic media can 
accomplish together.

folktales which originated from slaves

We sometimes use the stories to give 
ourselves hope, said Jonas.
In contrast with the traditional na
ture of Jonass stories, which drew from 
the earliest forms of art, Syd Mead, 
creator of the sets for the film 
Bladerunner, spoke on his ideas of art as 
it relates to futurism. His fantastical 
rendition of a city of the future has 
paved the road for experimentation in 
the fields of graphics and design.
Besides movie sets, Mead has created 
designs for other kinds of media and 
functions, including video games, elec
tronic equipment, and public transpor
tations systems..
Syd Meads work is an excellent ex
ample of defying the trend in design that 
form needs to follow the function, said 
junior design major Justin Petro.
In his talk, he emphasized simplicity 
in design, and posed the idea of the 
overlap between the fantastic and the 
realistic. He used scenarios of narra
tives to make the fantastic more real,
and applied those ideas in movies that 
he has worked on, including Johnny 
Mnemonic and Aliens
In the same way that Mead pushes the 
envelope between form and function, 2 
of the guests present at this years 
Wats:on? Festival allowed students to 
cross lines between disciplines, thus 
honoring the spirit of community that 
Jill Watson proclaimed.

Subject: Re: Movie Reviews
It has long been my contention that people on this 
campus, and in general, take life far too seriously. I 
have therefore dedicated much of my time and en
ergy to the often difficult task of trying to make 
people laugh. Therefore I cannot accomodate your 
request to treat my column with greater serious
ness, as the human race already has a striking 
surplus of that unpleasant commodity. I seek to 
entertain, and whether or not I am successful in that 
intent is a matter of personal opinion. You may 
dislike the apparent lack of respect with which I treat 
the weekly films, but I can honestly say (and I think 
the Crime and Incident Report junkies would agree 
with me) that I would rather read the column the way 
it is now than have it be serious, well-informed, and 
boring. Perhaps at a later date some chuckling, 
bright-eyed lad with more initiative and resourceful
ness than I will start a top-notch humor magazine for 
CMU, like the glossies so many other universities 
cuddle up to. But while I am here (excepting the 
annual Natrat issue) I will not give up what little 
humor we have, even at the expense of excellent 
films, and I make this statement not only as an avid 
film viewer but also as a filmmaker.
Anyway, this discussion is somewhat pointless 
since you only have to ignore me for four more issues 
. before I am summarily replaced, hopefully by an 
irate chimp who will mash away at his bananasplattered keyboard in howling anguish. More likely, 
however, is the prospect that this column will be 
renamed McConomy and revert to a stale rehash

Make Them Die Slowly
Banned in Deutschland, this Italian early 80s 
horror flick revolves around an anthropologist team 
sent in to deep Colombia to study, you guessed it, 
Juan Valdez and his simply oh-so-sexy mule. After 
being fired at repeatedly by Juans small army of 
desperado coffee addicts, however, the men tend to 
their wounds and decide to focus their studies in
stead on cannibals in their native habitat (smart 
move). But when they arrive at the Playa de Gringo 
Carne, they find all the cannibals have been en
slaved to pick cocoa leaves for Barney the evil drug 
lord. After labor disputes over a questionable 401-K 
plan, the cannibals all go nuts and eat everybody. 
Take that, Ralph Nader!

Play delves into writers Stories
ByALEXLEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Watching Collected Stories is 
like reading one of those dense, 
20,000-word profile pieces in The 
New Yorker: Every word is fasci
nating but, nevertheless, you 
cant help but wonder what else 
you might be doing with your 
time. (As one of the plays charac
ters quips, Lifes too short for 
The New Yorker.)
Like that magazine, Donald 
Margulies play will appeal to 
writers more readily than any
one else. Collected Stories 
chronicles the relationship be
tween an aging, wise, famous 
writer of fiction, Ruth Steiner 
(Shirley Tannenbaum), and a 
young, fledgling writer, Lisa 
Morrison (CMU drama major 
Erin Kirk), who seeks guidance 
from Steiner, her idol.
The women grow close over sev
eral years, particularly as Lisas 
talent blossoms and her stories 
are published. But everything 
changes when Lisa uses a pro
found experience from Ruths life 
as the basis of her first novel.
It is at this point that the play 
really gets going. We know what 
Lisa has done and why shes done 
it, and its fascinating to see 
Ruths reaction:
She is betrayed, 
heartbroken.
But Lisa defends 
herself quite 
convincingly, 
and finally, it 
becomes difficult to take a 
side in this argument.
Sadly, Lisa doesnt steal Ruths 
story until the middle of Act II in 
this two-act play. Until then, we 
see them talking about an as
sortment of subjects: motives for
writing, Woody Allens 
sex life, Ruths past,
Lisas father. Collected 
Stories spends so much 
time in set-up that the 
payoff cant possibly, 
well, pay off.
For writers, its amus
ing to watch Lisa squirm 
as Ruth reads her pupils 
fiction aloud and criti
cizes Lisa for using too 
many adjectives. Ruth 
is right  most of what 
we hear of Lisas fiction 
has that flaw. But at 
points like these, the 
play becomes less about 
two humans and more 
about two writers, which 
is less interesting. Its 
like watching doctors ar
gue about surgical pro
cedure  it may be in
teresting if youre a doc
tor, but most of us would 
rather see them in a spat 
over something more 
universal, like friend
ship or ego or sex.
The weaknesses of the 
script, however, are com
pensated by two highly skilled 
actors. In one scene, Ruth must 
deliver a massive monologue 
about a man she was once in love

Collected Stories is the City Theatres newest production, written by Donald 
Marguiles and starring senior drama major Erin Kirk (right.)
[The characters] delivery is so wellthought-out and so subtly emotional 
that you cant turn away from her for 
even a second."
with, and to look at this behe
moth on the page must have been 
a harrowing experience for ac
tress Shirley Tannenbaum. But 
her delivery is so well-thoughtout and so subtly emotional that
you cant turn away from her for 
even a second.
I confess I did not know the 
name Erin Kirk before seeing this 
show. But af
ter seeing her 
performance 
as Lisa, I will 
never forget 
that name, 
and I will look
.......   -for it from
now on. She 
brilliantly and meticulously cap
tures a character who starts out 
as a star-struck and frantic gradu
ate student and moves gradually 
into calmness, poise, and matu
rity. Finally, in the last scene,
Lisa must put all of this  every
thing she has studied, everything 
she has worked for  on the table 
and on the line. She must bare 
her soul to her friend and mentor. 
Lisa knows, as do we, that shes 
screwed up big time, and watch
ing Kirk, you can see the un
stated desire to go back and fix 
things and undo this mess she 
has made. Its fascinating and 
frightening. I dont care if this 
aint Broadway  give that 
woman a Tony!
Collected Stories is playing at 
the City Theatre through March 
22. For tickets or more informa

Mr. Vox hasn't exactly figured out what to do for spring break. He 
has a strange desire to hitchhike to Montana because there is no 
speed limit during the day. That way, he can run around with all of the 
big fast shiny cars and yell 'Zoom! Zooml" But that would mean having 
to find a person to drive him there, and Mr. Vox has never been too 
comfortable talking to strangers. He has discovered that many strang

To many, March 2.0 might just be another day in 
the spring where they can celebrate the birds chirping, 
the bees buzzing, and the green grass growing. But there 
is more significance to this date besides the fact that day 
and night will be of equal length. Frequencies began 
emitting from the black hole of the universe during the 
spring equinox of 1994. These frequencies are the sounds 
of creation and they indicate the birth of a new dimen
sional reality. To experience these frequencies, some re
sort to special meditation techniques. Others will per
form secret ceremonies in order to truly celebrate the 
arrival of new energy. Some wear dark cloaks covered 
with characters. Others might wear white clothing to 
symbolize the purity of spring. There are those who 
might also take on the form of an animal in order to feed 
on the energy of Mother Nature. No matter the ritual, 
many will also involve scriptures and staffs because of 
Natural Law #567, section xi. Perhaps holding a picnic 
to celebrate this day would be a lot easier.
Undergraduate Night will take place at
