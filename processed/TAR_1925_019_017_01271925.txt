PITT WINS IN 
TOUGH BATTLE 
WITH TARTANS
Traditional Rivals Have Now 
Won Two Out of Three 
Games Played
HIGH TENORS ARE IN DE
MAND BY GLEE CLUB
Trees Gymnasium witnessed one 
of its hardest fought contests last 
Tuesday night, when the Plaid was 
defeated by the score of 31-22. A final 
spurt put the Panther far ahead in 
the last half, and took the still lin
gering hope of victory out of the Car
negie representatives. Keen rivalry 
between the two schools was in evi
dence throughout the entire contest 
in the riotous cheering greeting each 
goal made.
Carnegie started the scoring first 
when Captain Matter tossed in a field 
goal and a couple of fouls in succes
sion. The ecstacy produced by this 
sudden scoring proved to be of short 
duration, however, for several min
utes later Pitt came to the fore, and 
managed to stay in the lead during 
the rest of the game. A long time 
elapsed before the Slubos could add 
to those first few points, and when 
the opportunity did come it found the 
Panthers lead increased to eleven 
points. A little later Obie Newman, 
playing in his first game this season, 
dropped two pretty field goals in and 
cut down the lead to six points. The 
half ended with the score standing 
20-14, in Pitts favor.
Shortly after the second half start
ed, Newman again scored two field 
goals, which brought the Carnegie 
total the nearest that it was destined 
to come to that of the Panthers. With 
the help of Parsons and Chase the 
Pitt team now cut loose and obtained 
a safe lead, not to be diminished dur
ing the rest of .the game. It was at 
this point that the Tartans were bad
ly outclassed, ana lost much of their 
hard earned ground. They broke up 
many tries which seemed certain to 
be successful, but could not score 
any further points themselves. A de
fensive game was resorted to for the 
remainder of the contest. At times 
during the latter part of the struggle, 
the skibos seemed to stage a come
back but nothing more than a few 
wild shots at the basket resulted. 
With the added practice of several 
weeks the Tartans should give a very 
much better account of themselves in 
the next game of the Pitt series...
Newman's part in the contest saved 
the day for I Carnegie and it is hoped 
that he will be available for the rest 
of the season. Matter and Donohue 
also' contributed their share in the 
attempt to level out the ^core.. The 
foul shooting of the Skibos was not 
all it should have been, in the game 
against the Panthers, nor in the sev
eral contests engaged in, to date. 
This is one of the surest means of 
gathering points and should not be 
neglected.
The playing of Bill Parsons was a 
feature of the game, and a very mate
rial factor in Pitts victory. Besides 
making live consecutive points at the 
foul line, he also dropped in several 
field goals. The diminutive Mayo 
played an important part in the scor
ing of the Universitys machine with 
his quick passing and acurate range 
of the basket.
Coach Lubic is planning to turn to 
advantage the lapse in athletic acti
vities during the examination period, 
and will no doubt have the squad in 
tip-top shape for the Grove City game 
on February 6.

PANTHER HERE FEBRUARY 13
An astounding fact lias been 
 brought to light! The Carnegie 
 Glee Club does not possess a 
 single genuine high tenor who 
 can sing a. good G or A. Several of the most important numbers on the program are falling flat because there are no 
 tenors who can sing these notes, 
 except in a falsetto voice.
There are excellent singers 
 attending college who are able to 
 t sing these high notes, but they 
 consistently hide themselves 
 and do not come around for a 
 tryout. It is not yet too late 
 for men to come out and make 
 the Club. Two long trips are 
 being made this year, an inducement that should bring out 
 every male student who has a  
 good voice.,
 Especially urgent is the need 
 for high male voices to sing *
 first tenor in the Glee Club. Di*
 rector Johnson will hear any aspirants on Slunday afternoons at  
2:30 in Room 160 in the College of Fine Arts.

DATE CHANGED TWICE
The date for the Men's Inter-Fra
ternity formal dance has undergone 
several changes from March 13, to 
the 20tli, but it is now definitely fixed 
at the thirteenth of March. The 
dance was to have been at the Uni
versity Club but has also been chang
ed to the Hotel Schenley Ball Room.
Formal affairs have generally petri
fied social aspirants in the last cen
tury. They have feared formal ap
pearances at a social jam probably 
because of an inability to voice opin
ion without cracking a shirt or creat
ing under leverage upon the winged 
collar.
Reading the back pages of Vanity 
Fair or College Humor will dispel 
all doubt as to risk taken at a formal 
or insure one that not all Arrow 
collar men will be there.
The modern tuxedo by Finchley is 
gradually assuming the cut and hang 
of a machinery production of mans 
overalls after, three years of service, 
and may be bought, borrowed or as
sembled for a few dollars.
Accordingly, the self-same man 
wearing the blanket shirt and floppy 
galoshes will bo seen at the inter
fraternity formal, gazing languidly at 
his golden locks, reflected by his con
federates lapel.

Illusion of Arabian Nights to 
be Carried Out in Every 
Detail of the Ball
The official advance bulletins for 
the annual Costume Ball of the Col
lege of Fine Arts, to be held on the 
night of February G, may now be ob
tained from the Secretaries Commit
tee. These bulletins were distributed 
after Art School Assembly, Tuesday. 
January 19, and contain not only the 
story of the Ball, but also informa
tion concerning eligibility, price of 
admission, the program, partners, and 
payment of dues.
The effectiveness of the Ball this 
year will depend as much on the clev
er*' lighting as on the splendid and 
fanciful decoration. The central 
lighting motif will be an immense 
crystal sphere, whose, myriad facets 
will reflect every brilliant hue con
ceivable. This illustration will be 
supplemented by more subdued and 
softer colored lights throughout the 
halls!
The Magic Urn., is the tentative" 
title for the Arabian fantasy being 
produced by Herbert Polesie and his 
assistants. This erftertainment will 
be presented at midnight for the di
version of the revellers. A Grand 
March immediately before the show, 
and supper immediately after it, lire 
features to reimimate any waning 
spirit.
The story of the Ball is briefly this: 
Schariar, a Sassanian Sultan of Per
sia, enraged at discovering the in
fidelity of his wife, strangled her, and 
vowed to revenge himself on women 
by. having any Avoman he. might 
marry strangled the next day. Sche
herazade, the daughter , of the Sul
tans Grand Vizier, desired to bo the 
wife of the Sultan, and refused to re
consider her determination. How
ever, on the morning after her mar
riage her sister, Dinarzade, appeared 
before the Sultan, and requested that 
Schheimade be permitted to toll one 
of the stories for which she was fam
ous.
The request was granted, and Sche
herazade began the stories that last
ed one thousand and one nights. At 
tlio end of this time, the Sultan was 
so enamoured of his lovely bride that 
he renounced his oath, and they lived 
thereafter in happiness and prosper
ity.

Budget Committee of Council
Installs New Report System
The Budget Committee of the Student Council has installed 
a new system in hope of eliminating the difficulties the committee . 
has formerly experienced in getting various organizations to turn 
in their budgets on time. Last year only'five out of about twen
ty-five organizations turned in their yearly reports on time.
Under the new system reports mil be due from each Budget 
Organization on the first of every month for the thirty clays 
preceding, ending on the fifteenth. These reports become due 
automatically and no organization will be in good standing1 
unless its report is in. They should, be mailed at the Carnegie 
Post Office, addressed to the Budget Committee of the Student 
Council..
Blanks for these reports can be secured from members of 
the Budget Committee, of which Jerry Slye is chairman. In 
addition to the monthly reports, a report for the year is due on 
the first of August, one. copy of which should go to the Student 
Council, one to the Dean of Men, and one to the incoming busi
ness manager.
This system applies to all Budget Organizations, including 
the publications, musical clubs, Kiltie Band, Union, Athletic 
Associations, Student Council, Campus "Week, Junior Prom, Y. 
M. C. A., Y. W: C. A., Arts Ball, .Gambol of the Guilds, Basket 
Ball .Leagues, Margaret Morrison Guild and the Science Stag 
Smoker.
The Carnegie Musical Clubs gave 
their second concert of the season at 
Springdale, Pa., last Friday night. 
The boys were well received by an 
enthusiastic dftidjence that completely 
Jilled the ball. This is the town .that 
Chet Brumbaugh made famous by 
starring at fullback for four years on 
Steffens football machine.
The clubs as a whole showed groat 
improvement over the Edgewood 
concert. The Glee Club especially 
sang much better, now that the fel
lows no longer use their music, ami 
can focus attention on the director. 
The type of songs being used this 
year require a great deal of work to 
obtain the necessary effects to put 
them across, and every piece is a 
'job in itself. It is the ' perfection 
of those effects that must be worked 
for, before the next appearances, and 
at the rehearsal Sunday afternoon 
many of thfc difficulties were ironed 
out.
The Instrumental Club did not. 
make a very impressive showing. The 
Hungarian Dance No. 5 by Brahms 
was their best number, and oven It 
coivjd be improved upon. As an en
core to the March Militairo they 
played I Wonder What's Bocomo 
of Sally and from what I could 
unrtorstand the listeners wanted to 
forget that she had ever existed. 
Every instrument sounded off pitch 
at the same time, and a saxophone 
load broke, which would have been 
all right if the drums had stopped 
a monotonous strumming. Stevo 
Ivovak got after Ills men on Sunday 
and a great change was notlcoablo 
at once. It simply was just an off 
night for his boys.
Both quartets did fair work and 
that is all. The Kilts helped put the 
Kiltie Quartet across, as the singing 
is not up to what it should be. The 
other bunch managed to get by but 
displayed nothing extra. Everything 
is too stiff about the quartets. The 
members stand in one spot and sing 
straight harmony like can be found 
on almost any corner where the gang 
congregates. More comedy and life 
should be injected into the songs, so 
the singers will feel more at ease.
The vocal numbers by Jack GumContinued on Page Four.)
Due to local conditions which shall 
prevail during the coming semester, 
it is not unlikely that a brilliant 
revue may bo substituted for the 
Campus Week play of the last throe 
years, and with this in view the comj 
miltee in charge is anxious to re-1 
ceive suggestions and help in the j 
planning of such an undertaking.
As the second semester approach-1 
es, plans for Campus Week are | 
starting to crystalize and although 
the various committees have not ye: 
been definitely appointed, Chairman j 
Rassbach and his ass^iatos have 
found themselves confronted with 
numerous problems, the biggest per
haps being tlio production of the an
nual Campus Week -play.
The work on this event Is particu
larly complicated this year by the 
absence of both suitable playwright 
and theater; When the custom was 
llrst inaugurated tlireo years ago, 
Harry Hamilton won his way to 
famethough not to fortuneby his 
hilarious production Ronnys Place 
and the followling year solidly es
tablished his reputation before an 
enthusiastic Campus Week audiences 
with Rabbits Feet.
Last year, although Harry was hero, 
Hugh Osborne, then Professor of the 
Drama Department, furnished the 
plot for the 'Blue Bandanna, while 
Hamilton devoted his enorglos to 
graduation. Mr. Osbornes produc
tion met with such a. success that 
It played before capacity audiences 
on two nights.
Now, however, tlio committee is 
confronted by the dilemma of having 
neither of these writers nvallablo 
and It Is doubtful whether anyone 
olso of sufficient skill can be se
cured who wlli bo willing to off or 
such a sorvico gratis, Furthermore, 
the Schenley Theater which In the 
past served to house those perform
ances has become a Harry Davis en
terprise and Is operating as a movie 
palace with such success that there 
Is little chance of Its being available 
Campus Week. The Little Theater 
Is obviously too small, the Music 
Hall Is not adapted to theatrical pro
ductions, the gym mis tonal quali
ties comparable to a ship yard, so that 
by simple elimination, cnoloo Is lim
ited to tlio Syria Mosque which has 
a capacity of six thousand.

To Mil a hall of such capacity as 
the Syria Mosque demands a produc

DR. BENEDICKS TO 
LECTURE IN MAR.
Fall in Price of Pillow Slips, Codfish Doing Dip
The Dips, Green Goldfish Shining up Their Hips
All These Should Lengthen the Next Eclipse
By Lyon Ase Potatoes.
The following treatise has been 
compiled by ii well known authority 
on heredity, heresy, tnd haberdash
ery and gives the correct scientifis 
principles and results of the late 
eclipse. (Two minutes late to be 
exact.)
The idea of scientifically investi
gating the recent eclpise was to de
termine the size of the sun, the 
moon, the solar system, and the cor
rect meaning of the mystic undergar
ment monogram B. V. D. The ap
paratus consisted of a son, a Moon, 
(no, Rollo, a Buick absolutely would 
not do) and a pair of field glasses 
calibrated to 0000000123456 micro 
crows. Under the usual circum
stances somebodys daughter should 
also be included, but she . wasn't 
there as per the following.
It seems the investigator has been 
running around with the barber's
daughter. ever since he started to 
razor and on this evening the bar
ber was all beard up. So the investi
gator calls us and says Do you want 
to sec the eclipse? And she conies 
back with What eclipse?" Now the 
scientific man, being a trifle English, 
says If you're talking about your 
old man I know darn well what 'e 
clips." That didnt go so big so 
she slams down th receiver and 
leaves him talking to about three 
miles of telephone wire and half a 
dozen operators.
Due to the fact that our worthy 
printer fails to own a font of type 
that contains the pis and various 
{ mathematical sings necessary for a 
successful treatise of the scientific 
j bases of the work, these will be 
omitted at this time. Suffice to say 
I that any student can find the rei quired texts in words of one cylinder 
j at most any second-hand bookstore.
As most of these books formerly be
longed to students they will be found 
to be unused and as good as new.
We reprint herewith an excerpt 
from the scientist's report after the 
manner of our own textbooks. It 
will be very readily seen that the 
circumstanstlal area or the sun be
ing directly proportional to Its mean 
spherical specific density, a simple 
integration will give us the number 
of legs necessary for the pulmonary 
propulsion of a three letter word 
meaning Heaven. The size of any 
son's Corona has been shown to be 
proportional to his dad's income and 
the number of journalistically in
clined roommates he possesses and 
hence we can deduce the size of his 
hat by the noise of the band.
We feel that we are well versed 
in the essentials of a Moon as he 
is and so at this juncture we give

Follow the Prominent 
Swedish Scientist
Dr. Carl Benedicks, a Swedish 
scientist /of international note, will 
lecture at Carnegie, March 11, 12, and
13. He is the Director of the Metallographiska Institute, a great scien

Dr. Benedicks is an authority on 
metallurgical subjects, and has con
tributed much to this science through 
his research Avork. He accomplished 
the first artificial production of me
teoric iron, in 1910. He has received 
many honorary degrees and awards, 
including the Carnegie Medal for 
Metallurgical Research.
The subjects for the lectures will 
probably be: "Some Points of View 
on the Kinetic Constitution of Sollrl 
Matter;" "Theory of High Speed 
Steel;" and A Determination of the 
Specific Gravity of Molten Iron,"
Dr. Albert A. Michelson, another 
scientist of equal, or even greater 
fame, will probably speak hero dur

away, At 2:00 A. M. next Saturday 
morning, the wonderful sparkling 
Promenade of the Junior Class of 
11)20 will live only in the memories of 
the elect. Never before has there 
been such enthusiasm, such a com

When the name of Ted Weems is 
mentioned around Carnegie in con
nection with dancing, thats all thereis to it, every one is going if it is at 
all within the realm ol! possibility. 
Tods orchestra is composed of young 
fellows, most of them have gone to 
college, and they know just what the 
care-free dancers at the William Penn 
next Friday will want in the way of 
syncopated wailing bluos. In ap 
poarancos at tlio Willows last sumnioi*, and at several performances at 
tlio Aldino thoalre, thoso wonderful 
musicians have demonstrated that1 
they are the cream, as entertainers 
as well.as players of marvelous dance 
melodies. If any ono Is still In doubt, 
Just put ono of tlioir records on theold Vlctrola and Do convinced.

ol! decoration, that will turn the Wll 
llan Penn ballroom Into a paradise 
of gay colors and lights. Tlio or

which ovorything will radiate, the 
idea being to center the attention on 
the melody makers, and yet have a 
colorful and artistic whole.
An extravagant affair like (he .Jun

a magnificent program that the girls 
can display on a prominent page In 
tlioir memory books, and tlio hoys 
can carelessly leave In a conspicuous

Preliminary tickets are still on sale 
for the moderate sum of $<1.00, or if 
llrst preliminary was. obtainod, the 
price is but $2.50. The committee, 
however, has indicated that they will 
not be averse to receiving the ontire

Faculty of Mechanical Engineering Dept Engaged
In Considerable Research. Various Aspects of 
Ventilating Being Studied. Are Completing Book
Unknown, perhaps, to many Car
negie men and women, is the work be
ing pursued by the Mechanical En
gineering Department. Tho person
nel of this part of our school Is en
gaged. at present in several lines of. 
activity which may prove to ho of 
popular interest. There Is little
chance, of course, of any phenomenal 
oiscoverles being made, yel; activity 
of the nature ol! their Investigations 
contributes to the store ol! sclontlilc 
and technical knowledge, and assists 
In promoting the welfare of Carnegie.
Professor Trinks, head of the de
partment and consulting engineer for 
several local industrial concerns, Is 
conducting a series of tests in the 
Mechanical Engineering laboratory 
on ventilators. In heating and venti
lating installations, the shape of the 
ventilator has an important bearing 
upon the efficiency and proper func
tioning of the system. The purpose
of these investigations is to deter
mine the best shape of ventilators 
which will give the most favoiable 
ventilating action with low wind ve
locities.
Mr. Saylor has Jusl* completed a 
series of tests on the effect of baro
metric pressure and tomporaCui'0 as 
well as atmospheric moisture on the 
resistance of a fan dynamometer. One 
method of determining tho power de
veloped by an automobile engine Is 
by l lie use of the fan dynamometer. 
The results of these tests should be 
oi! interest to the automobile Industry 
and will assist greatly in increasing 
the reliability and precision which 
can be attained with a device of this 
typo. The final results will be pub
lished as soon as they have been com
pletely evaluated. Some time ago, a 
Buick chassis was purchased for ex
perimental purposes and is now being 
installed. It will probably be ready
for use by the students oarly in tho 
second semester, and presents the 
possibilities of some interesting ex
periment.
Professors Estop and Blalsdell, al
so of tho Mechanical Engineering De
partment, are just completing a book, 
of problems on tho subject of Ther
modynamics and Power Plants. The 
book is to be ready for publication 
dIdler late In the spring or ear?y In 
the summer, and will bo a collection 
of problems which covers practically 
every phase of tlio subject. This 
marks another step in the publication 
of texts by the faculty of Carnegie.
Tiie elements of Machine Design, a 
course which is quite familiar to 
many of our engineering students is 
being enlarged and improved upon. 
A number of new problems have been 
introduced and new equipment has 
been added with the intention of mak
ing (he course more popular.

SEE WHAT HAPPENS
College is n kaleidoscopic mid nevcr-to-be-iorgolton memory 
book, someone lias said in a moment of inspiration. And the state
ment is quite true, if we stop to imagine what we are going to reremember oi! our college life five years from now. Probably, well 
clearly remember four campus weeks with their niglits of enjoyment 
and days of recuperation; Oarnegie beating Pitt or being beaten, by 
Notre Dame; and perhaps, going to General Assembly on a winters 
day. Or are you one of that silent majority who do not support as
semblies?
Do you realize that for the past three years, students have been 
finding it inconvenient to attend assemblies, have preferred to forget 
all about them for the sake of eating an. early lunch. Three or four 
years ago, assemblies were real ial3!airs, to be looked forward to with 
anticipation and interest. What lias brought about the change? The 
music, is just as good, the stunts could not be improved upon, and the 
speakers are not only just as interesting, but tlvey also get through 
their speech-making promptly.
One conclusion, then, can bo arrived at. The students them
selves have changed, have lost somehow that added hit of interest 
which sent them acrofiiB Schenley bridge in the coldest weather. Of 
course, it few loyial souls go each month, but the number of vacant 
seals is appalling. We should think this thing out from a broader 
point of view than our own personal and restricted one, before we 
decide to go back to the dorm or fraternity house and forget about 
assembly. The college authorities have worked the whole situation 
oyer, have you? Here we are, four colleges, each with our separate 
all'airs scarcely touching the lil'e in the other colleges. We need some 
central meeting place, some place where we can all be together and 
forget that we are Engineers or Maggie Murphs, nndi be just Car
negie students. Have you ever thought ol! the General Assembly as 
one solution ol'iour rather un eentralizcd situation? IF you do stop 
to think, then doubtless, you too will arrive at the conclusion that 
U oi i ora I Assemblies are a necessary and vital part ol! Carnegie life.
/lust one more thing to think about. When a thing is not sup.-: 
ported, it censes t.o exist. Do we want General Assemblies, in fact, 
nil assemblies, abolished? Can you imagine college without as

The Week 
in thei
j Worlds News
By Leslie P. Beebe
1. The Johnson Resolution.
2. Another Disarmament 
Conference.
3. The New German Cabinet.
Hiram Johnson of California, will 
save the United States yet from the 
villainous Europe, We have only to 
wait for the hero to appear on the 
scene and then, with the shouting ofthe crowd, aii that will be necessary 
to make the melodrama complete will 
be a paper snow storm. Believing 
himself to be the only irreconcilable 
left, lie has introduced into the Sen
ate a resolution, which has passed, 
calling for a copy of the agreement 
signed In Paris last week at the Al
lied Financial Conference between 
our representative, Col. Logan, and 
those of England and France. The 
expressed motive behind this is to 
find ot/l. how far we have committed 
ourselves into foreign entanglements 
by the agreement allocating 2J/i l>er 
cent, of reparations to the United 
States.
One of the major questions of the 
. resolution concerns itself with the 
matter of violation of the Treaty of 
Berlinour separate peace with Ger
manywhich states that this govern
ment shall not be represented on any 
body, agency or commission author
ized under the Treaty until "An Act 
of Congress of the United States shall 
provide for such a representation." 
Then there is the question of the 
moral, as well as the legal agreement 
which we have entered into
Mr. Hughes, the Secretary of State, 
took care of the legal agreement in 
a formal statement in which he sum
med up tiie administration policy as 
follows:
1. The purpose of the conference 
of the Finance Ministers was to reach 
an agreement on allocation of pay
ments expected through the Dawes 
plan.
2. The conference at Paris was not 
a body, agency, or commission provid
ed for either by our treaty with Ger
many or the Treaty of Versailles 
so it was not a violation of our treaty 
with Berlin.
3. The agreement was merely an 
allocation of the payments made und
er the Dawes Plan and it makes no 
provision for questions that may 
arise, nor does it.bind us in any way, 
legally or morally.
4. The agreement at Paris neither 
surrenders nqr modifies any of the 
treaty rights of the United States.
Mr. Borah, chairman of the For
eign Relations Committee was quite 
satisfied with tills explanation and 
feels quite relieved. The opponents 
will find it hard to get an-opening in 
Mi\ Hughes logic. The statement is 
quite conclusive. But all protesta
tions of t.lio administration to the con
trary, wo are in Europe. We may not 
be bound legally, but wo are morally. 
We have accepted a share and in 
doing tlils our Interests are tied up 
with those of the Allies, and should 
Germany dofaulL, common justice 
alone would force us to help collect 
or liolp solve again the tangle.
An amendment, to the Naval Appproprint,Ions Hill, calling for a new 
disarmament conforonco has the ap
proval of the administration and Jjas 
passed the senate. The resolution 
calls for a Conference in the City of 
Washington which shall be. charged 
with the duty of formulation and ent
ering into a general international 
agreement by which armaments for 
war, either upon land or lea, shall be 
effectually reduced.
i most praise. These, with the snap 
and enthusiasm and energy of every 
one on the stage brought vividly be
fore us the brawling colorful life of 
| the Italian peasant. Mary Brown was 
i a delightfully impudent Nina, and 
\ Mary Power did her usual delicately 
; humorous character work as the shop
keeper. Against these, the two genj tlewomen were clearly outlined. Ann 
| Luria especially was like an olghtJ eenth century picture come to life, 
j The men were evenly good, and here 
| too the social distinction was well 
i preserved. Curiously, one feels like 
j especially praising Harry Mervis for 
j letting himself be overshadowed. He 
j is usually so forceful that only care-- 
I ful acting and an intelligent regard 
I for the play as a whole kept him ton| ed down to his proper place. Wrilliam 
I Martin managed the general seedi
ness of the down-at-lieels nobleman 
with an equally nice regard for his 
function the play.
Allene Gregory.
FRUSTRATED
President Collidge has had this 
step in mind for some time and now 
It becomes a reality with Senate back
ing. Yet it is still to be wondered 
whether any new agencies are need
ed for international cooperation and 
disarmament. It; is never the agency 
but the spirit that determines the 
success of a conference, and coopera
tion can never be engendered by a 
mere multiplication of agencies.
Much interest is centered iu the 
new cabinet of the German republic 
and especially in their policies as out-1 
lined by the new chancellor, Dr. Hans 
Luther, a member of the Nationalist 
party. The keynote of his program 
seems to be the safeguarding of the 
constitution and the carrying our. of 
the London compact and the Dawes 
Plani Opposition forces are already 
mustering strength to kill the newlyformed cabinet. Especially strong 
are the Monarchists, the Socialists, 
and the Communists'.
The more conservative papers such 
as the Deutsche Zeitung feel that this 
is merely the first stage and that the 
situation is both insecure and critical. 
The Communistic and Socialistic pappers bitterly donounce the govern
ment as the Dawes" government and 
call upon the workors to destroy it.
Germany is passing through a cr.itcal stage but there is no doubt that, 
with a moro secure industrial footing 
and loss unemployment:, reactionary 
fooling will subside somewhat, giv
ing away t.o conservatism.
The new cabinet Is composed of the 
following:
Minister of Foreign AffairsGustav 
Streseman.
Minister of the Interior  Martin 
Schiele.
Minister of Labor-Heinrich Brauns.
Minister of EconomicsKarl Newhaus.
Minister of Food  Count Von 
Ivamtz.
Minister of Justice and Occupied 
DistrictsFrenken.
Minister of WarOtto Geisler.
Minister of PostsHerr Stingl.
Minister of FinanceCount Van 
Schlielien.
Minister of Traffic-Friedrich Krolin.

j EDITOR'S NOTE: This sketch
was submitted in a story-writing 
class and proved to be of such 
unusual merit that it was deemed 
worthy of publication.
Just at dusk they carried his body 
in; the tramp of  feet upon the 
porch brought Mrs. Trent running 
to the front door and there she met 
the man. They carried her son into 
the bleak parlor and laid him down 
upon a couch whose springs creaked 
beneath his dead weight. Rivulets 
of slimy water oozed down to the 
floor and trickled away in futile lit
tle streams.
You see, Mrs. Trent, one of the 
men began to explain hesitantly, he 
got out where the waters deep. The 
undertow musta dragged him down, 
.because he went under before any
body saw him. He"
Yes," answered Mrs. Trent tonelessly, I 'understand."
Some one must stay here with 
you," proceeded the man, arrange
ments must be made forforevery
thing. You cant stay alone."
Yes, yes, I can.. Please go. My 
daughter Ellens here with me and 
I don't need help1.
"Ill, send .my wife over then, and 
she can stay tonight. Maybe Tom 
here 11 send his wife, too, and Tom, 
and I can sit downstairs."
No. Please go, Mr. Wilson," re
plied the woman. I can take care 
of Jim myself, and I know he 
wouldn't want' strangers around. 1-Ie 
was always shy, and why should 
death change him?
Mr. Wilson pulled at his collar 
awkwardly, but it don't seem right, 
you being here all alone, Mrs. Trent. 
Seems like you should have some
body here to look after you, sort 
ofcomfort you.
Her opaque eyes .gleamed for an 
instant. 1 do^t; need comfort.. Im 
all right-now go!*
J3ut"
"Good evening."
Reluctantly the men shuffled out. 
Holding the candle high above her 
head, Mrs. Trent stood in the door
way and watched them go. She was 
always watching. She was forever 
just, around the corner in the 
shadows and one had only a lieetlng 
Impression of softly-brushing skirts 
and eyes that pried. She was a col
orless woman, dwelling in an aura 
of drabness that was limited only by 
the dicker of her eyes. She had a 
most disconcerting habit of nodding 
her head up and down as though 
she were in communication with 
some inner self, and frequently this 
secret intercourse appeared to please 
her, for she would chuckle -slyly and 
her face would draw into lines of 
unlovely mirth. Now, as she peered 
down the dark pathway, she began 
to wag her head knowingly. Softly 
she closed the dopr. and slipped in
to the parlor.
Mother, mother, called a girls 
voice, what has happened?"
Nothing, dear; dont come down
stairs.
Mother, tell me, why were those 
men here."
They came to see me on busi
ness. Ellen, if you dont stay up
stairs, Ill have one of my' spells. 
The girl on the upper landing 
shuddered. Ever since her father 
died, six months previously, Ellen 
had watched her mother grow more 
peculiar each day. Prolonged fainting 
attacks were Mrs. Trents latest tac
tics for obtaining what she wanted, 
and while Ellen was almost sure 
these attacks were simulated, she
was afraid to cross her mother, lest
the illness be real, after all.
Where is Jiin, mother? Why
doesnt he come home?
1-Ie has come home, darling, lies 
down here with me. Now do go to 
sleep."
"Oh, Im frightened! I want to 
come down, mother.
Ellen, go to bed. Everythings 
quite all right.
Mrs Trent began to light a candle 
and hum monotonously.
"One at . his head, and one at his 
feet.
One at his head, and ono at. his feet. 
One at his head, and one at his feet.
There Jimmy, that will help you.
You can see better now..............One
candle ............two candles are bright
er than one candle.
One at his head, and one at his feet. 
One at his head, and one at his 
feet."
Night had fallen completely now, 
and a high wind had arisen; round 
and round the house it flew like 
some evil sprit, and its song grew
THANKS TO PAULS

TRAVELING IN SPACE AND TIME
eerie. The candles burning in the 
room cast ghostly shadows and the 
white face of the thing on the couch 
seemed to leer maliciously at its 
surroundings. Mrs. Trent glided 
from window to window, watching 
the storm and muttering to hersel?.
First you take my husband, then 
you take my son. Next youll take 
my daughter. But I shall not let 
you. Ah, no! 1 have a plan to get 
even with you.
The night grew blacker and, the 
wind rose to a gale. Down, down 
burned the caudles; one flickered 
out. Mrs. Trent crouched motionless 
at the feet of the body. She seemed 
to abide her time patiently; she 
made no sound, but her lips moved 
constantly, and her eyes gleamed 
like those of an animal waiting for 
its prey. The second candle sput
tered out, and left the room black asthe night outside. A weird singing 
arose from the place where the 
woman sat; at times it mingled with 
the howl of the wind, hut again it 
dropped to a soft, sinister murmur
ing. Now the voice seemed to have 
changed its position, for it moved 
slowly around the room.
Suddenly she went down on her 
hands and knees, and began to creep 
out of the room. The inky shadows 
covered her, but her skirts made a 
sofe, sliding sound. She moved 
slowly, and ever so cautiously, as 
though she feared some one might 
stop her. Every now and then she 
glanced fearfully back over her 
shoulder, but she never hesitated 
an instant. On and on she crept. 
Now she had reached the kitchen 
door. Now she had found the table 
and her . sure hands searched the 
drawer for the knife she knew to 
be there. She moved towards the 
door again this time going even 
more silently than before. The storm 
outside drowned the brushing of her 
body over the floor, 'but to the 
woman, intent upon her mission, 
this smaiL sound seemed tremend
ous.
I must-be cureful.............1 cannot
fail..............I shall Lake my daughter,
and then they will not get her..........
Never mind, Ellen, mother will save 
you. Under her breath she chant
ed,
One at his head, and one at his 
feet.
One at his head, and oue at his feet.'
But theyve gone out now..............I
suppose its very dark. Ellen, my 
child, you will not need a light.
Now she had reached the steps. 
Up she crawled, sliding oue hand 
against the wall to guide her.
Upstairs in her room Ellen lay, her 
eyes straining into the darkness. A 
sense of some menace lurking near 
over-whelmed her and she listened 
intently. Yes, there it was again! 
Something was coming up the steps. 
She could hear it now. It crept. She 
knew that by its stealthy movements 
and the sliding sound it made. It 
was drawing closerah, God! W7hat 
could she do? She braced herself to 
meet this unknown danger and wait
ed. Waited. What was this creep
ing that was coming toward her 
through the night? Now it was at 
her door. SETA it moved across the 
floor to her bed. She raised her 
hand to strike, but suddenly, a knife 
descended, silently and swiftly. She 
sighed once, and something warm 
and red trickled down to the floor, 
making no splash as it fell.
Our Arts Theatre audiences have 
been very amenable. For the past 
month they have been enjoying, real
ly enjoying, two old comedies, the 
tFan, andw A Pair of Spectacles with 
only an occasional wistful murmur to 
the effect that such good acting and 
staging and producing might better 
have been giypn to more entertaining 
plays.
Might it? To answer that brings us 
back to a re-statement of the raison 
detre of an Arts Theatre. The School 
of Drama exists to educate, in a 
large degree, first of all our students, 
but also the public which accepts our 
hospitality. Now it is the essential 
of humanistic education that it hu
manizes us; it lifts us out of our 
individual petty lives, localized in 
early twentieth century America, and 
makes us free of a whole planet and 
of all the recorded centuries.. Vre 
acquire a body of historical fact, and 
by a sovereign act of imagination and 
sympathy we make fact live, so that 
the past of the race becomes our past, 
intimate and accepted as the memor
ies of our own youth.
Let no one suppose such humane 
education is easily acquired. It is a 
difficult feat to make the past live, 
to view it without antagonism and 
without idolatry. Even literature, of 
all arts most humane, most ageless, 
opens no easy path to the traveller 
iii space and time. Old plays, read 
alone, seem queer and unmeaning. We 
read that Goldoni is the Italian Moliere, and that the '90s had often a 
sweet wisom and humor under their 
sentimentalism, but we do not hon
estly enjoy Goldoni and we are bored 
by the AOs.
Do we not then owe a special debt 
of gratitude to Mr. Payne and Mr. 
Viehmann for so producing, "A Pair 
of Spectacles and Tire Fan, that 
our range of sympathies is widened? 
A Pair of Spectacles was a charm
ing evening of kind laughter at hu
man nature, in its obviousness a 
wholesome antidote to our rather 
neurotic subtleties. The Fan was a 
riotof color, of vociferous Italian 
peasant life, played at top speed by a 
crowd of vital and hilarious young ac
tors. We leave both plays conscious 
that something lias, been added to our 
range of enjoyments. We have taken 
a real journey in space and in time.
As to the actors. In A Pair, of 
Spectacles, Phil Thorns whimsical 
and genial old gentlemen is the fig
ure that remains longest. in 6nes 
memory. Mr. Thorns little twinkles 
of humor over certain lines kept the 
part from becoming too naive. He 
made the audience laugh with him 
just the right amount. Ben Weinblat 
played Gregory opposite him with his 
usual gusto. Miss Sowersby was 
pleasing, except that she somewhat 
repeated herself from the young step
mother in Magda. Perhaps the part 
had not enough color to make her 
build anything very different. James 
Resleys work is .showing a steady 
growth which argues well Cor his 
future. He played with a good com
bination of youth and poise. The 
minor parts all deserve mention, did 
not space forbid.
The Fanis so even a piece of 
genre painting that here too individ
ual comment seems invidious. The 
scenery and lighting deserve perhaps
HERMAN S. DAVJS REPLACES
A. N. HEYL AS CASHIER
j Mr. Herman S. Davis has been ap
pointed recently as cashier of the 
Institute to succeed A. N. Heyl. It is 
felt that the cashiers office is in 
competent hands, as Mr. Davis has 
had a wide experience as an expert 
accountant and engineer.
In an interview with the Tartan 
representative, Mr. Davis stated that 
at present no radical changes will be 
j instituted in his office. Gradually he 
intends to establish ideas that he has 
accumulated during his many years 
of experience in many similar lines of 
endeavor.
For the las't five or six years the 
new cashier has been employed in 
various capacities as an engineer and 
general public accountant. Previous 
to that he was withan oil refining 
company, well known in this district, 
the Gulf Refining Company. Mr. Davis 
received his A. B. and A. M. at Prince
ton and his Ph.D. at Columbia.

NEW YORK ARCHITECT
PAYS CARNEGIE VISIT :
It is of interest to note that many 
civic organizations take our school as 
a standard for efficiency of plan. The 
latest, instance of that nature to come 
to our attention is tile planning of 
the proposed city Musicand Art Cen
ter in New York City.
In this case the architect, William
H. Sompert, visited Carnegie  before 
making recommendations to the bu
reau in charge of the project.
The Music and Art Center, as pro
posed is destined to be one of the 
outstanding achievements of the 
decade.

Though no games are being played 
this week or next, considerable ac
tivity is being manifested in Interfraternity-Dormitory Basketball Lea
gue circles. At a meeting of the sev
eral managers and other officials last 
Wednesday quite a few moot points 
were threshed out and pains taken to 
insure a smoother organization.
The present constitution of the lea
gue is to be gone over, with a view 
to revision of some of the most dis
puted rules and a general clarification 
of others. ; Suggestions tending, to 
improve the successful operation of 
the schedule will be incorporated in 
it, as well as several new rules re
lating mostly to eligibility.
As popularly understood, the league 
is supposed to have no greater pur
pose than to determine the best 
basketball team in the various fra
ternities and dormitories. In reality, 
however, it has much wider and high
er aims, and the heads of the organ
ization this year intend to make it a 
fulfillment of all its avowed objects. 
These are three in number; namely, 
to promote better feeling among the 
fraternities and dormitories, and be
tween the fraternity man and the non
fraternity man; to develop any laient 
varsity material; and to provide re
creation and exercise for those who 
wrould not otherwise get it.
There seems to be little doubt that 
the league of this year is going to 
be much more prominent as an organ
ization than any in former years. 
With its higher .idealism and deter
mination to prevent any possible dis
putes, both the fraternities and dor
mitories should have a successful 
basketball season.
February 3, is the first game to be 
played in the resumption of hostili
ties after examinations. Complete 
schedules of the three leagues may 
be obtained at the office of the Fhy 
sical Education Department in the 
Gym, by those desiring them.

WILL WE BE DISAPPOINTED?
Everyone iscognizant of the fact that the'varsity basket ball team has 
not set the world afire so far this season. That is common knowledge. Wo 
are not blaming anyone for this state of affairs; Coach Lubic is doing all 
that can be done under the circumstances; Midge Matter is a hustling. 
Fighting leader, and the boys are responding nobly with their best efforts.
But there is a ray of hope shining for followers of Carnegie athletics. 
The old saw that it is always darkest just before dawn still holds true, even 
iu Tartan basket ball circles. What do we mean?
Simply this. Coach Lubic has worked hard with his men, and has 
finally reached the point where they are potentially as strong as any team in 
this district. They only need a little more spark, a little more finesse in
jected into the present lineup to make it one of the best, if not the best, in 
the Tri-State district. And just now it appears that that spark will be fur
nished in the person of Toots Annins, one of the real basket ball finds of the 
year.
Toots was not eligible at the beginning of the season, but all indica
tions point to his eligibility at the end of the semester. He has worked hard 
at his studies, and should come through in good standing.
It now only remains for Donohoe, Matter, Lynch, Conrad. Beede, New
man, Glanz and Cook to remain eligible, and with the addition of Amans well 
say, Bring on Pitt. Wash-Jeff and Notre Dame; we are ready for them. 
It is almost certain that Beede and Newman will be O. K.; they always are. 
We are not so sure about the others, for some of them are on the ragged edge.
We are not begging for anything from the'faculty. We dont want them 
to hand the athletes anything that they would not give to any other student. 
But we hope that when grading the papers of the above men the instructors 
will bear in mind just how much their eligibility means to the men them
selves, and to the school as a whole. We hope the instructors hand out the 
marks just after a good, hearty meal, or after a pleasant conversation on the 
recent eclipse, when they are in a conducive frame of mind. We hope the 
boys get every possible consideration.
WE ARE PULLING FOR A WINNER THE SECOND SEMESTER!
THE 1925 CROSS-COUNTRY CAPTAIN
Clarence E. Peck, who is taking the Mechanical Engineering course and 
is only a Sophomore, has been elected captain of the cross-country team for 
next fall, succeeding "Howdy Dykenianv leader for the past two years. We 
feel the choice has been a wise one, for Peck is a. hard worker and has the 
respect and confidence of the other men. He is a Pittsburgh boy and a mem
ber of Druids.
Peck is tall and rangy, built along the same lines as Dykeman. If we 
can only be assured that he will prove to be as great a runner as Dykeman 
is, our cross-country team next year should be able to hold its own, for 
in addition several good men are coming up from the Freshman team.
HOW WE STAND
In another column are given a few statistics regarding the varsity basket 
ball team. During the first semester the team won one game and lost four, 
but in none of these games, with the exception of the Princeton game which 
came Loo early to be considered, have the Tartans beon woefully outclassed. 
Every game was hard fought, and exciting. Geneva, a team that trimmed both 
Pitt and Wasli-Jeff, was defented by the Plaid. Things do not look so black 
as some of the calamity howlers would have us believe.
GREAT RACES
Speaking of Howdy Dykeman, IT will be a. distant day boforo we forgot 
his great race against Schuyler Enclc, of Penn State, at the Schenley Oval 
two years ago. . lbykoman and Enclc ran neck and nock for almost two miles. 
When about 300 yards from the finish lino Enclc spurted and forged ahead of 
Howdy about, a yard. But Dykeman had more roserve loft, and about five 
yards from the line he took the lead oyer his rival and won out. by inches, 
it was one of Lwo groatesl and most spectacular races wo over saw.
How did you hit that tost?
From what we can gather, Professor Gecklor is in his glory just now.
It has bpon reported that the eclipso had nothing to do with tho awful 
drubbing the Plebes received at tho hands of tho Panther Cubs.

In the preliminary to the varsity 
game with Pitt,, the Carnegie Plebes 
underwent a severe operation. They 
were outclassed from start to finish, 
and when the final whistle blew they 
were trailing 011 tho short end of a 
5G to i) score. The only thing that 
the Plebes were able to do was to 
stand out 011 the floor and let tho 
Pantherlings shoot and score at will. 
Even 011 the foul line they were sadly 
disappointing for they were able to 
garner only 3 out of 12 while the 
Pitt Freshies averaged six out of eight 
trials in the same deparlme.nl.
It would be hard Lo name any par
ticular outstanding star for the Pitt 
aggregation for they were being put 
in and taken out without being given 
a sufficient; length of time in which 
to show what they were capable of. 
No one player was outstanding for the 
Plebes, the reason can be seen in the 
resultant score.

Goal Scoring
A lapse of two weeks in Carnegies 
basketball schedule, due to final 
semester examinations, gives us an 
opportunity to gather a few statistics 
011 the team for the first part of 
their schedule. Playing a total of 
five games, Carnegie has had the mis
fortune to drop four of them. Out
side -of Lhe overwhelming defeat at 
the hands of Princeton, all of tho 
games have been close and hard 
fought throughout. The opposition 
has garnered a total of ITS points 
against 1"! for Carnegie. Consider
ing the caliber of teams encountered, 
coupled with the dark prospects at 
the boginning of the season, this re
cord is fairly satisfactory. However, 
there is plenty of room for improve
ment and it is hoped that the team 
will arise to its greatest heights after 
the exams are over.
Donohue and Matter lmve been the 
stars of tho soason to date. These 
two have accounted for over half of 
the teams points and has been direct
ly responsible for a groat many of tho 
others. Donohue has accounted for 
13 goals from the field while CapLaln 
Matter has counted 1.1 times. Tho 
teams foul shooting has been excel
lent making a total of 43 fouls out

THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
Though tho twonLloth contury Is but 
one. fourth past;, wo may notice three 
contributions or tho first rnagnliudu 
It has already mado to tho science 
of physics: tho oloctrlcal theory of 
matter, including lhe inertia of en
ergy; the quantum thoory; and the 
theory of relativity.
The nineteonlh conlury closed with 
rather vague Ideas current as to the 
nature of electricity. While some re
garded it as an independent enlily 
of unknown nature, others supposed 
It to be a state or . condition of the 
ether of space, and hence a form of 
energy like light. In the closing years 
of the century our ideas regarding 
electricity began to trend rather defin
itely in a certain direction, namely, 
toward a correlation of electricity and 
matter.
At the beginning of the twentieth 
century, gravitation was a great mys
tery. In spite of much experimenting 
and more theorizing, the phenomenon 
of gravitation stood apart, refusing 
to show any correlation to other phe
nomena. In the year 1900 our knowl
edge of gravitalion was just where 
Newton had left it, two centuries be
fore. It was left for Einstein to point 
out that which when once seen is 
never forgotten  the correlation of
gravitation with inortiu.
But greijt as aro tho coordinating I 
and correlating proportion of the the
ory of relativity, it cannot bo regard
ed as Lhe last word In Its line any 
more than can the quantum concept; 
for tho theory of relativity begins to 
fall us when applied Lo rot.al.lng bod* 
loB. Horo, as Eddlngton says, it stops 
explaining phenomena1, and begins ex
plaining them away. It is, however, a 
great stop in ddvanee, and much of 
it will remain premanontly in Lhe 
theory of physics oven when It shall 
bo supplanted, as it must be. by some 
broader and better concept.
Whore, then, has the progress of 
three centuries In physical science 
brought us? Of the many distinct con
cepts of the eighteenlh century not 
one is left. The sole concept of mod
ern physics, energy, was not known 
in the eighteenth cenlury; and this 
concept is above all things Immate
rial. The theoretical structure of our 
science Is left withoul material means 
of support. The twentieth century so 
far is a century of bewilderment. But 
it is young yet; may we not call it 
the Century of Hope? Who knows 
whether it will lead us?

tho course, on Electric Starting and 
Lighting Systems, tiiiB subject will 
be offered during tho first semester | 
beginning next September. Under 
this plan, a student who enrolls in 
tbo course next month will bo able 
to take the full two-semester course, 
by returning for one semesters work 
next year.
Tho opportunity of applying during 
the summer the training acquired in 
the coming semester is suggested as 
an important consideration by offic
ials at the school.
A feature of the course in Auto
mobile Maintenance and Operation at 
Carnegie is tho withdrawal of any 
academic requirements of students 
who wish to take the work. The only 
restriction is that applicants must be 
li) years of nge or older. Although 
previous automobile experience Is de
sirable, it is not essential.
The auto courses ut Carnegie Tech 
are designed for men who desire prac
tical training and thorough technical 
discussion of automobile coustVuctlon. 
Each course, to be taken about HO 
hours per week, is complete In Itself 
and may be taken alone under certain 
conditions without having had tho 
other.
Tho course in General Automobile 
Repairs, which will be repeated for 
bngjnnors next fiomostor, covers moOhanical construction and adjust
ments of Ilio autombile with carburo* 
tion and elementary ignition. Tho 
course in Electric Starting and Light
ing System Is given entirely to the 
electrical equipment and trouble test
ing.
For tho second semester registra
tions win ho held on Tuesday and

NOT TO BE OUTDONE
Tho following story Is told of a

A NEW METHOD
A pompous woman on a train jour

was a big fellow for his age, and the 
lady very small. The collector look

"Sir," said the woman, if that be

had a vlolln-guitar that was not 
nearly so good and should bo loft

An Indian danco by Warren Kim

program. Too much cannot bo said 
about this dance, which Is something 
entirely novel. It ban to bo soon to

During tile lutormisslon a chalk

Puny Caution.
Caution is a very puny form of mor
ality. He that observetli the wind

the clouds shall not reap." It Is as 
true politically as of other spheres of 
life that "lie or she' who lets tho 
world, or his own portion of it choose 
his plan of life for him lias no heed 
of any other faculty than the apelike 
ono of imitation."
J. C. Sanford made district sales 
manager of Firestone Rubber Co.
Another of tlie multitude of Carne
gie Alumni who have made good since 
leaving our ranks is an ex-member 
of the class of '24, Mr. J, C. Sanford. 
He was enrolled here in the Machinery 
Production course, in Machine Major.
At the time he left school, the 
Firestone Rubber Company selected 
thirty-five young engineering gradu
ates for the purpose of learning the 
business and managing branch agen
cies. Due to his previous ability, San
ford was one of engineers chosen 
There were six other Machinery Pro
duction men chosen for this training 
course.
He was highest in the rating at the 
completion of the training course, and 
four months after his graduation he 
was made sales manager in charge of 
the Worcester, Mass., agency, of the 
Firestone Rubber Company.
Mr Sanford, having seen service 
overseas during rhe war, came to Car
negie as a student on the Federal 
Board. During his summer vacations 
lie worked or the Dravo Construction 
Company. They were impressed with 
his merits and tried to secure his 
services alter he had finished here. 
But the Firestone Company made him 
an attractive offer in a different field 
which he accepted.
He will be remembered here be
cause of his efficient management of 
the tickets at. the fotball games, dur
ing the fall of 1923.
Sanford has selected a field where 
he can use to a good advantage the 
striking personality which won him 
so many friends while in school. 
Being in competition with not only 
six other Carnegie men, but twentynine graduates from other schools and 
yet winning first place shows the ad
vantage of practical training and a 
rqurtderl education. These combined 
with tbo proper personal requisites 
should turn out' a competent and 
efficient man. Sanford was a member 
of the Alpha. Tau Omega fraternity.
Saturday morning, January 24, the 
exams scheduled for eight-thirty were 
postponed until ten oclock. It seemed pure benevolence on the part of 
the administration, but it did not 
seem advisable to postpone the 
eclipse of the sun also scheduled 
at that time.
Even the one-thirty exams were 
postponed until two-thirty, allowing 
quite a little extra cribbing time for 
some and additional agony for others. 
What a pity that eclipses dont occur 
more often and last all day about 
this time of year.

Mjuch .lias, been written regarding 
the value of a college education to 
the man entering business. Discus
sion pro and con, has resulted, as 
too much discussion of a similar 
nature results, in merely confusing 
the young man who is confronted 
with the question as to whether or 
not it is worth his while to spend 
fqur or more years in acquiring a 
college, or university educatioii.
In general the question which 
such a man asks himself both be
fore and after entering college is, 
Will the time and money I am 
spending here pay a reasonable divi
dend in dollars and cents? That 
the answrer 'to such a question is an 
unequivocal. Yes, is best illus
trated by the attitude which modern 
businesstakes toward higher educa
tion.
A few months ago the General 
Electric Company decided to create 
a lasting memorial to Richard Ii. 
Rice, a former manager of its works 
at Lynn, Mass. It did so by estab
lishing a scholarship at Stevens In
stitute of Technology.
Even more recently the same con
cern has set aside a considerable sum 
of money to establish four scholar
ships at Union College to serve as 
a  memorial to Dr. Charles Proteus 
Steinmetz, former consulting engi
neer of the company.
When one of the largest electric
al manufacturers in the world be
lieves that there is no better way 
of honoring the memory of two of 
its best loved and most prominent 
engineers than by establishing schol
arships bearing their names there 
can be little doubt that ,it is the be
lief of those who govern the poli
cies of that concern that education is 
worth while.
Further proof of this contention 
is supplied by the fact that of the 
350! to 400 student engineers employ
ed annually by the company prac
tically all are graduate engineers. At 
the same time a number of students 
from the commerce and economics 
school are employed each year by 
the company in the accounting de
partmentThe New Student.
This is the time in the school' year 
in which a .student is torn between 
two great and opposing forces. Ex
aminations demand that you brush 
the dust from those textbooks and 
begin perusing so that you may sat
isfy the curiosity of a not too indul
gent professor while the mind, which 
is mox-e socially inclined, drifts away 
and imagines its bearer gliding to the 
etheral tunes of Ted Weems Musilcers in a gorgeously decorated ball 
room full of flushed and exicited 
dancers.
With these thoughts predominant, 
little wonder that Calculus, Physics, 
oi* Mechanics must suffer. Its inhuman 
to ask us to pour over them with 
this big event booming ahead.
How nice it will be when we gradu
ate and get out into the world and 
have nothing to worry us. No exams 
to stare us in the face. Then we will 
come back and really enjoy the Prom.
How about it Alumni, are we right? 
Or are these worries just a part of 
the shadows which helps us enjoy the 
sunlight.
BEAUX ARTS JUDGEMENT
The hundreds of visitors who at
tended the Industrial Art Exhibition 
last December at the Carnegie Mus
eum under the auspices of the mus
eum and line arts department, saw 
an exhibition that demonstrated the 
artistic ability of this country to pro
duce objects of high art. This exhi
bition was modeled after the ones 
held in the Metropolitan Museum, 
New York and was the first of its 
kind ever held here.
The material for exhibition was as
sembled by Mr. ^tew-ard, Homer 
S'aint-Gaudens and Edward Duff Balken. The exhibition wras installed by 
Harold Geohegan, who is the profes
sor of the History of Arts at Carnegie 
Tech and curator of decorative arts 
at Carnegie Museum. Mr. Geohegan 
is a graduate of the University of 
Dublin, 1900, University of Paris, 
1905. He received the certificate d' 
etudes. franaises and in 1911 he 
came to Carnegie.
This exhibition was intended to 
help the manufactors in order that 
they would strive to make everything 
on the basis of quantity production, 
as well as the Europeans.

W. Dann, vice president and treasurer 
of the Keystone Sand & Supply Co., 
delivered an interesting address be
fore the Student Chapter, A. S. C. E., 
taking as his subject "Sand and Gra
vel Industry of the Pittsburgh Disrict.
Mr. Dann told how the use of sand 
and gravel had increased in this dis
trict from a few tons a day to the 
present consumption of 400 carloads 
daily.
In connection with the desire of his 
company to improve the quality of 
their product Mr. Dann stated that 
a plant had been built to make sand 
by crushing gravel and although ex
perimenting is still going on the 
idea is a successful one. It is believed 
that this is tlie first attempt ever 
made in the U. S. to make sand on 
a large scale by this method.
