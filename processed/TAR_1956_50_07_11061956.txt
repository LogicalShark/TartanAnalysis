Planned For Techites
Over Thanksgiving vacation all students from Tech will have 
the opportunity to visit the United Nations. Sponsored by the YMCA 
^4 the YWCA, this will not be just a tour, but a planned seminar 
in which students will hear the delegates from India, Israel, and
Egypt, and have an opportunity#---------------------------------------------------------
to discuss the situation with
qualified persons and students 
from other colleges.
This is a very timely opportun
ity to become an educated citi
zen of your own nation and of the 
United Nations. Certainly during 
the past week the main thought 
in the minds of people every\$Aere has been the situation in 
the Middle East. Every college 
student must be wondering how 
the decisions being made now 
will affect their individual lives 
and world peace. The United Na

Fannys First Play 
fs Drama's Next
After Thanksgiving, starting 
Saturday, December 1 and ending 
December 8, the drama depart
ment will present Fannys First 
Play by George B. Shaw. It is a 
delightful social satire taking place 
in England about 1910.
This play consists of a play, 
within a play. The cast is: Jack 
Shaheen, Ed Martz, Jim Goldfyig, Carol Cox, Jay Kabler, Dick 
Bernstein, Lewy Olfson, Brook 
Howard, Clyde Sharp, Marlou 
Jahn Joe Sommer, Gayle Greene, 
Joan Feldman, Janice Meshkoff, 
Nancy Pickhardt, Dick Brown, 
Sarah Zide, Denise Huot, and 
Carl Kraft.
Briefly, the plot is concerned 
with Fanny, the wonderfully tal
ented daughter of a very eccen
tric count. She persuades her 
i#ther to let her produce a play; 
the critics rave about it, but since 
the author is an unknown, prob
lems result.
Leonard Staisey 
Will Analyze 
Election Results
Who Won The Election?, an 
analysis of the presidential elec
tions, will be presented by Leon
ard Staisey, assistant district at
torney of Allegheny County next 
Tuesday, November 13, at 11:30 
in the Fine Arts Little Theater.
The talk will consist of an an
alysis of both candidates, their re
lationship with their parties, the 
issues of the campaign, and the 
American people as responsible 
voters. There will be an opportu
nity following the talk for the 
audience to raise any questions 
they .might have concerning the 
elections.
Mr. Staisey, in addition to his 
duties as assistant district attor
ney, has been president of the 
Duquesne Board of Education 
since 1949, and is a member of 
the Board at the School for Blind

Among the mony honors which 
Mr. Staisey has accumulated is 
thePittsburgh Junior Chamber 
of Commerce Presidents Award, 
which was presented to him in 
1950 for self-achievement. In 
1944 he graduated with highest 
distinction (magna cum laude) 
from Northwestern University, 
and was selected by Whos Who 
of Colleges and Universities as an 
outstanding personality. He grad
uated in 1947 from Northwestern 
Law School, where he was presi

Neiv Jazz Club 
Will Be City-Wide
Plans by Phil Moskal, jazz edi
tor of the Pitt News, and a 
few of his associates are now un
derway to organize a city-wide 
jazz club. The plans are a step 
forward to help Pittsburgh and 
its people realize that jazz isnt 
Elvis Presleys be-bop-a-loobop but expressions of soulful 
improvisation and harmony. The 
club will incorporate all surround
ing colleges and nurses training 
schools.
One of the organizations main 
features will be that it brings the 
jazz devotee to a better under
standing of the whys of the 
new, different interpretations of 
progressive jazz. Moreover the 
club will bring the fan and mu
sician to a common ground. Here, 
the musician finds what the fans 
like, and the fans come to.under
stand the musicians expressions. 
At dances where student com
bos will play, the member is af
forded an opportunity to widen his 
social scope.
National Recognition
The initiation of such a club is 
whole-heartedly approved by jazz 
musicians around Pittsburgh, and 
Down-Beat magazine offers mem
bership in a national jazz frater
nity to the club when organized. 
Thus there will be auditions for 
the best combos and the winner 
will be given a chance to make 
records.
Though uncertainly establish
ed, dues will probably amount to 
$2.00 a year, while general meet
ings and sessions will be month

Long Years Of Russian Control 
Seen To Cause Polish Rebellion
By George Mark Ellis, instructor in history
The recent outbreak of rebellion against the Soviet regime, which 
threatens to undermine their whole satellite empire, began signifi
cantly in Poland. An examination of its past history may throw 
some light on why Poland led the first effective popular opposition 
to Stalinism since World War II#
In the fifteenth century when 
Russia was establishing itself in 
the Moscow region, Poland devel
oped out of a combination of 
Lithuanian and Polish areas. And 
while Russia was moving in the 
direction of tsarist absolutism on 
an Eastern pattern, the Polish 
state became an aristocratic, con
stitutional monarchy founded on'
Western ideas and institutions, 
and dominated by the influence 
of the Roman Catholic Church.
Poland Rarely Free 
In the course of the next few 
centuries, this cultural divergence 
led to renewed warfare between 
the countries, the Poles looking 
upon the Russians as their cultur
al inferiors. By the eighteenth 
century, Poland, for a variety of 
reasons, had become weakened in
ternally at a time when Russia 
was taking a more active interest
in Western European affairs and 
when Russia was also growing in 
importance. Caught between Rus
sian, Austrian, and Prussian am
bitions, Poland ceased to be an 
independent state when it was ab
sorbed into their territories.
At the end of the Napoleonic 
Wars, Poland again became a na
tion, but this time under the con
trol of the Russian tsar. Its his
tory during the nineteenth cen
tury was marked by increasing 
Russification, though the Poles 
tried unsuccessfully in 1830 and 
again in 1860 to resist this pro
cess. During this period, hatred 
for the Russians increased in in
tensity.
Cultural Unity
At the end of the first World 
War, Poland finally achieved na
tional independence, but this lastLContintied Sh ine 4J
If CITs mock election results are in any way significant, the 
nations voters today will re-elect President Eisenhower by an over
whelming majority. Statistics show that he received 75.6 per cent 
of the total votes cast, Stevenson, 22.5 per cent, and Carmen Mon?oxide 1.26 per cent.
Faculty tallies, however, pre
sent an entirely different picture. 
Tech instructors elected Mr. Stev
enson by a one per cent margin49.5 per cent of the vote going to 
Eisenhower and 50.5 per cent to 
Stevenson.
The election, run by APhiO, 
was sponsored by CRA, Mortar
board, and the Tartan. Student 
can be _un for everyone. The men I voters cast a total of 870 ballots.
Dorms To Sponsor 
Election Nite Party 
In Girls Rec Room
Excitement reigns high today as 
the voting takes place. Tomorrow 
the Cut will be filled with both 
sad and glad faces, but tonight
and womens dorm council are 
sponsoring a party that can prove 
to be a success. From nine till 
twelve-thirty (the girls can all 
get free specials) the students will 
gather together down in Morewood Recreation room to listen 
to the results of the voting. Re
freshments will be served and ev
eryone is urged to come. So dont 
sit up in your room and weep 
alone. Remembermisery loves 
company, so join the others and 
have a lot of fun.
If you have to be a bookworm 
(exams you know), then WRCT 
has made definite plans to broad
cast all the election returns on 
November 6, from the time they 
start coming in until one of the 
candidates concedes. The returns 
will be broadcast approximately 
every fifteen minutes between the 
musical selections. Five-minute 
summaries will be given every 
hour, so that the WRCT Coverage 
will be as good or better than any 
other station'swith fewer com
mercials!
Tutoring To Begin 
For Tecli Frosli
A new plan for aiding freshman 
women scholastically has just 
been completed by Phi Tau Gam
ma, the junior womens honorary.
while or.ly 83 faculty members 
participated. These figures mean 
that 26.5 per cent of the student 
! body and 23.3 per cent of the fac
ulty took part.
Jay Early, president of APhiO, 
blamed the meager interest on the 
lack of publicity. He said that 
many were unable to vote because 
they did not have ID cards with 
them.
As compared with the last 
mock election, the 1956 effort 
shows a marked increase in polit
ical interest. Dr. Dale Strick, co
ordinator of student activities, 
said in part, We hope that the 
higher percentage of voters is an 
indication not only of student 
concern with politics but of a 
growing interest in campus activ
ities.
Write-ins included Carmeo 
Monoxide, the candidate support
ed by Rege Cordic, KDKA disc 
jockey, 11 votes; Sergeant Hidcck, 
1 vote; Pogo, 1 vote; Mac Arthur, 
1 vote; and the Socialist Labor 
Party, 1 vote.

Tonight the nations networks will carry up-to-the minute news 
on the presidential election, and by early tomorrow it will be decided 
who will lead the country as chief executive for the next four years. 
Some of you will hav,e participated in the national elections for the 
first time, voting one way or the other for a variety of reasonsmost 
of them, we hope, well-considered.
But how about those who couldnt vote today? One may ask, 
What good is it to discuss political issues and express opinions when 
I have no voice in the government? Political discussion in college 
is the best preparation for future civic responsibility, and can be 
ignored only to the detriment of the individual and the college communit}. _
All had the opportunity last Thursday to express opinions in 
Techs mock elections, organized for the purpose of stimulating stu
dent interest in national eventsfor the benefit of both voters and 
non-voters.
Only 26.5 per cent of the student body took the trouble to vote, 
and the faculty representation was even worse. Have we the right 
to criticize our parents who just cant find the time?
It is true that the publicity could have been better and some for
got their ID cards, but there were too many who had no excuse other 
than plain laziness and indifference.
Students in Hungary are dying for the right to hope for a better 
future . . . can we, who have every opportunity to speak and act 
freely, do less?

I should like to congratulate you and your capable staff 
on the excellent fiftieth-anniversary edition of the Tartan. 
The four-page insert containing material from Tartans of 
other years was very interesting reading indeed. I am sure 
that your student readers found many surprises among the 
varied items on these pages. Those of us who have been at 
Carnegie for some time have been reminded both of half
forgotten incidents and of how much change has taken place 
at Carnegie during the past fifty years.

LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: No. 1
In this day of swift international communications, 
like radio, television, and the raft, it becomes increasingly 
important for all of us to have a solid grounding in 
foreign languages. Accordingly, I have asked the makers 
of Philip Morris whether I might not occasionally forego 
levity in this column and instead use it for a short lesson 
in language.
Of course, silly! chuckled the makers, tousling my 
yellow hair. Oh, grand men they are, the makers of 
Philip Morris, just as full of natural goodness as the 
cigarettes they make. Of course, fond boy, you may 
occasionally forego levity in this column and instead use 
it for a short lesson in language! said the makers and 
tossed me up and down in a blanket until, rosy with 
laughing, I bade them desist, and then we all had basins 
of farina and smoked Philip Morrises and sang songs 
until the campfire had turned to embers.
For our first lesson in language, let us take up 
French, which has often been called the lingua franca 
of France. We will approach French in a new manner, 
because, to be brutally frank, the way it is taught in our 
colleges is archaic and obsolete. Why all this emphasis 
on grammar? After all, when we get to France does it 
matter if we can parse and conjugate? Of course not!
So for the first exercise, translate the following real, 
true-to-life dialogue between two real, true-to-life French
men named Claude (pronounced Clohd) and Pierre (also 
pronounced Clohd) :
CLAUDE: Good morning, sir. Can you direct me to 
the nearest monk ?
PIERRE: I have regret, but I am a stranger here 
myself.
CLAUDE: Is it that you come from the France?
PIERRE: Yott have right.
CLAUDE: I also. Come, let us mount the airplane 
and return ourselves to the France.
PIERRE: We must defend from smoking until the 
airplane raises itself.
CLAUDE: Ah, now it has raised itself. Will you have 
a Philippe Maurice?
PIERRE: Mercy.
CLAUDE: In the garden of my aunt it makes warm 
in the summer and cold in the winter.
PIERRE: What a coincidence. In the garden of my 
aunt too!
CLAUDE: Ah, we are landing. Regard how the air
plane depresses itself.
PIERRE: What shall you do in the France?
CLAUDE: I shall make a promenade and see various 
sights of cultural and historical significance. What shall 
you do?
PIERRE: I think I shall try to pick up the stewardess.
CLAUDE: Long live the France!

of Geneva followed to take second 
being chased by Arnie Olds, Techs 
old veteran, who was third and 
Dickinson of Slippery Rock who 
was'fourth. Eric Ottervik, who all 
season long had shared winners 
circle honors with Bryant and 
Olds, placed fifth after being the 
pace setter for the first two thirds 
of the race. No Tartan was to 
then dent the finish line until 
21st when Phil Hubbard came in 
and he was followed by Len Elikan who was 31st. Geneva, by 
scoring 48 points, was ci'owned 
champion, while Tech after an in
spiring start, had to be satisfied 
with second place honors due to a 
lack of depth and experience out
side of the tireless trio.
The weather was perfect for 
Bryants winning race although 
the course was still damp and wet 
in places due to the previous 
weeks rains. Previous to the TriState meet, the Tartans traveled 
to Grove City for a dual meet and 
returned home with their seasons 
sixth win in eight starts as the trio 
finished in their customary tie for 
first. Larry Bryant was voted most 
valuable by his teammates after 
his sparkling victory.
League Crowns 
To Be Decided
In last week's action two league 
championships were decided in 
I.M. football as the Kappa Sigs 
and Phi Kaps won Kiltie and 
Tartan crowns respectively.
The second place team in each 
league, w^hich is entitled to a spot 
in the playoffs, has not been de
cided, but at this point it looks 
like the SAEs, Beta Sigs, and 
Met Grads will also vie for the 
coveted IM crown.
. The Kappa Sigs gained the Kil
tie title by defeating ATO 31-26, 
in one of the hardest fought 
games of the season. ATO jump
ed off to a quick 18-7 lead, but the 
Kappa Sigs, not to be denied, 
fought back for the victory. The 
game was a battle of passing off
enses as all but one TD were 
scored via the air route. Mean
while, the Civil Grads almost 
pulled an upset victory, but the 
SAEs won 21-20 in the last 15 
seconds of play.
The Delts lead the Skibo league 
as expected by defeating TX 24 
to 17. Laugherty, Spahn, and 
Mihm, led the Delt team which 
has not tasted defeat this year.

Tech Receives
Tech received the opening kickoff and was forced to punt after 
making no headway. F&M did 
no better and Tech took over on 
their own 25. After Briner had 
gained six yards, Tech fumbled 
and F&M recovered the ball on 
the 30. A Tech off-side gave F & 
M a first down on our 17. They 
were momentarily halted when 
Benner broke through and nailed 
a halfback for a five-yard loss, 
but on the next play a completed 
forward pass resulted in a score. 
The extra point was added and 
Tech trailed 7-0. F & M kicked off 
and the Tech backfield swung into 
action. They ploughed out two 
first downs with Majeski, Briner, 
and Quatse doing the carrying. A 
Tucci pass was intercepted on the 
Tech 48. F & M fullback Dussinger 
then made 20 yards through center 
on the final play of the first quar
ter.
Early in the second quarter a 
Tucci punt was partially blocked 
and the Diplomats had a first 
down on the Tech 14. Tucci was 
taken out with a broken wrist. 
Another quick pass resulted in a 
score and Tech trailed 14-0 as the 
extra point was good. Tech re
ceived the kickoff and punted aft
er -losing a total of six yards on 
three plays. F&M took over on 
their own 38 and after an ex
change of punts had the ball on 
their own 49. Tech was penalized 
15 yards for a personal foul, how
ever the clock ran out before F & 
M could move.
2nd Half
Hammer kicked off starting the 
second half. A sustained drive 
was stopped on the 30 and Tech 
took over. MacElhenny and Myers 
combined to produce a first down 
before Muths pass was intercept

ered a fumble and again it was 
Tech first and ten. F&M quar
terback Darrah intercepted a long 
Muth pass intended for Myers. A 
long pass gave the Diplomats a 
first down on the Tech 45-yard 
line. On the next play they sprung 
a halfback loose for 45 yards and 
a score. The extra point was good 
and the score stood Tech 0, F & 
M 21.

before Knapp punted to start the 
fourth quarter. F&M was unable 
to get started and Tech took over. 
A Muth to Ficery pass was good 
for 11 yards. MacElhenny swept 
around end for 35 yards and an
other Tartan first down. The only 
sustained drive of the day for 
Tech ended on the F & M 35 where 
Tech lost the ball on downs. A 
screen pass immediately put the 
Tartans back in the hole and it 
was F&M first and ten on the 
Tech 40. The Tech defense held 
and stopped the Diplomats on the 
38. Another Tech pass was inter
cepted but the Tartans took over 
as F & M punted. Briner gained 
10 yards and the game ended Uith

Delt-Chi 0*8 Win 
Co-Rec Volleyball
By Bruce Bowen
The co-rec volleyball season 
ended last Tuesday in the form of 
a single elimination tournament 
with Delta Tau Delta-Chi Omega 
emerging the victors.
After winning the first match 
against Beta Theta Pi-Kappa 
Kappa Gamma quite handily in 
two quick games, they were 
thoroughly whipped by Pi Kap
pa Alpha-Independents in the 
first game of the final match. 
However, the Delts-Chi O evened 
the match at one game apiece. 
The Delts-Chi O showed excel
lent teamwork as they completely 
outplayed their opponents in the 
final game, giving the Delts the 
honor' of being campus champs 
two years in a row.
The members of the winning 
team were Nancy Gardner, Ruth 
Vysoky, Ginny Austin, Eleanor

second place. As it now stands, 
they are tied with TX but the 
Met Grads, still undefeated in 
league play can cop the second 
place. The big Met Grad-Delt 
game was played Monday.
The Tartan pennant went to the 
Phi Kaps, who wrapped it up with 
a 13 to 7 victory over a fighting 
Sigma Nu six. The Phi Kaps had I Manley, Judy Wells, Peggy Coyne, 
to be at their best to meet the SN Evie Eld, and Velma Fritsch of

Student Directory 
Issued To Every 
Evening Student
This past week, the Neighbor
hood Directory of Evening Stu
dents was sent out to all students. 
This writers personal opinion is 
that it is much nicer than last 
years. It is easier to read and al
so neat looking. This is the second 
year of publication and one of its 
main purposes is to provide a 
means of extending acquaintance
ship among Carnegie evening 
students.
Through this book one may lo
cate other members living near by 
and form a car pool. Parking is 
certainly a terrific headache un
less you are able to come quite 
early. Upon leaving at the close 
of class, it isnt surprising to find 
your car wedged in because so 
many others have come too.
The book becomes quite useful 
at Christmas time for .those who 
like to send a card to their class
mates or members of their group.
It is a handy guide in calling 
others to attend meetings for the 
sorority, student council, New
man Club, etc.
This publication is still an ex
periment so any suggestions or 
comments Will be greatly appre
ciated.

public, which was set up by the 
Soviets at the end of World War 
II, ironically enough was mi.e 
Polish than any previous regime.
At a result of Nazi persecutions, 
the majority of Jews were ex
terminated, the Soviets had an
nexed the Ukrainian elements, and 
the Poles subsequently expelled 
the Germans so that present-rday 
Poland is ethnically homogenous

being of Polish blood.
Moreover, the country is 95% 
Roman Catholic and the ChurCn

doubtedly in recent times has 
played a significant part in keep

the Soviets.
