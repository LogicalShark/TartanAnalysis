Vol. 36 No. 12CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1940
Dr. Dohertys Statement
(Editor's note: The following is 
the text of a letter sent by Presi
dent Doherty to the management 
of Kaufmanns Department Store.)
Dear Mr. Kaufmann:
I am writing to apologize in 
behalf of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology for the editorial in The 
Carnegie Tartan yesterday which 
I have just read relating to the 
strike at Kaufmanns.
Such emotional effusions repre
sent the price an educational in
stitution must pay from time to 
time, for maintaining the policy of 
a free press in student publica
tions. We have no pre-publication 
censorship, and the only editorial 
restructions are the traditional 
' ones as to truth, decency, defama
tion of character, and off-campus 
matter that would clearly involve 
the good name of our institution. 
This editorial represents a clear 
violation of these points.
We follow another principle. 
The students are given as full re
sponsibility as they will take for 
running their own affairs. Thus 
the operations of the Tartan are 
within the purview of the Student 
Council, and thus, in the first in
stance, it is in this Councils hands 
to deal with the present situation.
I have great confidence in our 
student body as a whole. It has 
demonstrated by its attitude and 
action on numerous occasions its 
sound common sense on issues that 
are of fundamental importance to
the students and the institution. 
But unfortunately there always 
are a few individuals in a student 
body, as there are in any social 
community, who place an exacting 
strain upon organizations involv
ing freedom, and self-government, 
and sometimes jump the traces. 
However, I have confidence that 
the students are quite aware of the 
basic issues and will protect them.
I thought I should state the 
above policy of the institution re
garding student activities, and I 
am sure you will agree with its 
soundness.
To come to the present specific 
case, while I do not wish to pre
judice the editors position with 
the Student Council, I neverthe
less feel obliged, in view of insti
tutional embarrassment, to say 
that he dealt with matters that 
were none of his editorial business 
and thus stultified not only his 
own position, but also that of his 
editorial associates, the student 
body, and the institution.
As an indication of the attitude 
of his colleagues, I have just re
ceived, while dictating this apol
ogy, a letter of resignation of Her
bert Reich, Business Manager, 
protesting against the action of the 
editor. I enclose a copy of his 
letter..
I repeat that my colleagues and 
I deeply regret this unfortunate 
incident.
Sincerely yours,
Robert E. Dogherty. n
Free Courses Offered 
For Defense Training
Regional Supervisor John D. 
Beatty, of Carnegie Tech, an
nounced last Friday the free 
courses which will be offered for 
national engineering defense train
ing in Western Pennsylvania, 
West Virginia, and Western Mary
land.
Most courses are scheduled to 
open January 6, with registration 
being held on January 6, 7, arid 8. 
They (will be given over a period 
of from 12 to 24 weeks. Most of 
them can be taken on a part-time 
basis, and many of the classes are 
planned for evening hours to ac
commodate employed men. A high 
school education or its equivalent 
is necessary for admission, and 
there will be no tuition charge 
expenses being met as part of the 
national defense program. The 
courses are designed to meet spe
cific needs in industry and will 
not be credited toward college 
degrees.
According to recent estimates 
about 7,500 persons will be train
ed in this region, under the super
vision of Carnegie Tech, Pitt, Penn 
State, the University of West Vir
ginia, Bucknell and Grove City. 
In the Pittsburgh area over 1,000 
have already enrolled, Mr. Beat
ty revealed; with the Tech, Pitt 
arid Penn State extension taking 
care of from 3,000 to 3,500. All 
prospective students are urged to 
apply immediately to the defense 
training director in the above in
stitutions, or to Mr. Beatty.
Courses made available at Car
negie Tech by action of the Ad
visory Committee on Engineering 
Training for National Defense on 
Dec. 2, are as follows: engineer
ing drafting, machine design, test
ing and inspection, elements of 
metallurgical engineering, produc
tion supervision and production 
engineeririg. To coordinate these 
courses with all activities of the 
general faculty that have to do 
with national defense, the follow
ing committee was appointed at 
Tech: EngineeringMessrs. B. R. 
Teare, Jr., G. A. Rohlich, Cyril
Student Aliens
Examiner John M. Daniels last 
week warned that all foreign stu
dents here on a visa must register 
as aliens. A fine of $1,000, six 
months in prison, or both, is the 
penalty for failing to register, but 
many aliens living in Pittsburgh 
have not yet supplied the neces
sary information. Those who have 
not already done so should ap
pear at the Shakespeare School, 
the New Federal Building, Room 
417, or the North Side Post Office 
before December 26, when the 
registration period ends.
Wells and D. S. McKinney; Arts 
Messrs. J. B. Ellis and Robt. Lepper; Margaret MorrisonMiss
Jean Ludebuehi and Miss Grace 
Sheriff; General StudiesMessrs. 
R. E. Parshall, M. L. Carroll, Jr., 
and M. P." ChwOtlowsky; and in 
Physical EducationMiss Louise 
G. Russell. The committee elect
ed Mr. Rohlich as chairman and 
Mr. Chworowsky as secretary.
In commenting upon the defense courses Mr. Beatty said:
From government surveys it 
is apparent that the next year 
will witness the largest increase 
in employment that this country; 
has ever seen in a similar period 
of time, and in this district it will 
be especially marked, inasmuch 
as estimates of the Bureau of La
bor Statistics now provide $3,- 
445,143,000 for materials to be 
used by the defense program in 
the iron and steel industry alone, 
which is 54% of the total appro
priation for materials.
The free courses sponsored by 
the U. S. Office of Education of
fer a wonderful opportunity to 
mechanically inclined men.
Failing: Grades 
Are Redefined
At a recent meeting the Edu
cational Senate passed the recom
mendation of the committee on 
Examinations and Marking Sys
tem concerning the F grade. It 
was decided that the grade should 
be retained, but that it should be 
redefined. Under the old system 
an F grade meant that the stu
dents work has been so unsatis
factory that, in addition to ful
filling any special requirements 
that his professor might prescribe, 
he must take the re-examination. 
If the exam and extra work were 
completed satisfactorily, the stu
dent was given a passing grade.
Under the new  system, an F 
(failure) indicates that: while 
the work up to the final examina
tion was of passing quality, the 
semester grade, including the ex
amination, was not passing, but 
giv6s reason to suppose that the 
student could demonstrate a sat
isfactory grasp of the course 
through a re-examination, and 
that the student possesses prere
quisite foundation for the follow
ing course. An R grade indicates 
as in the past: "The work up to 
the final examination was not of 
passing quality, and the semester 
grade, including the examination, 
was not passing.
The department heads and the 
department staff members were 
consulted in formulating the new 
system, and it was decided that 
it should be put into effect for the 
present school year, at the end of 
which the matter will be careful
ly revised and permanent steps 
will be taken.

at the Carnegie Union.
In a ceremony immediately pre
ceding the induction of Dr. Jones 
and Dr. Rohlich, pledges of the 
regular fall group were also in
itiated. Selection for membership 
in Theta Tau is based upon schol
arship, integrity, and promise of 
engineering ability. The initia
tion ceremonies were followed by 
a dinner at which Professor J. B. 
Ellis, head of tho Sculpture Dept., 
was the principal speaker.
In addition to Dr. Jones and 
Dr. Rohlich,; the new initiates are

Senior Pictures
All seniors who havent had 
their portraits taken for the 1941 
Thistle are requested to come to 
tho Thistle Office in the Carnegie 
Union this Friday afternoon be
tween 2:30 and 5:00 to arrange 
details with the editor.
Seniors who have not return
ed their proofs for the 1941 This
tle to Gimbels should do so to
day or tomorrow, Decerriber 11,
1940. After tomorrow the studio 
will select the pose which will be 
used in the yearbook.
Changes Made 
In Vacations
The Executive Board asked the 
Committee on Calendars, to revise 
the general calendar plan for 
1941-42, because of the difficul
ties resulting from the recent 
change in the Christmas vaca
tions. The most important changes 
involve the Christmas and Easter 
holidays, and the date of the end 
of the second semester.
The Christmas recess is to ex
tend from Thursday, December 
18, to Monday, January 5. This 
change was made to aid students 
who Wish to obtain employment 
during the vacation, and to give 
out-of-town students sufficient 
travelling time after New Year. 
The extension is also helpful to 
faculty and administration mem
bers, who attend various Christ
mas conferences.
Since both students and facul
ty had complained that the Eas
ter vacation was too short to be 
of any definite value, it was de
cided to lengthen the vacation to 
a week and a day. School will 
recess a week before Easter and 
will start again on the Tuesday 
following Easter.
Because of these two vacation 
extensions, the second semester 
will not end until June 0, so that 
the desired number of school days 
mny be had.
Before this action was taken, 
the Faculty Conference Commit
tee and Student Council wore 
asked to pass on It. The Council 
approved the change, but suggest
ed that it be submitted to a stu
dent poll. But due to the fact that 
the 1941-42 catalogue is going to 
press very shortly, there will not 
be sufficient time for taking the 
poll. However, it is felt that the 
new arrangement will be highly 
satisfactory.
Mortar Board

Robert Cummi-B84j89 Tech liramat3 Heturns
By Otto Krenn
Robert Cummings, stage, screen 
and radio star, and former stu
dent at Tech, entertained audienc
es at the Stanley Theatre last 
week. He and other stars were 
brought to Pittsburgh by movie 
columnist Louella O. Parsons.
At the age of 30, his brief bi
ography is interesting. He was 
born Charles. Cummings, son of 
Dr. C. C. Cummings in Joplin, 
Mo. In 1928, he entered Drury 
College, in Springfield, Mo., to 
study Mechanical Engineering in 
preparation for Aeronautical En
gineering. He stayed at Drury for 
one year, then came to Carnegie 
with advanced standing, and en
tered the Mechanical Engineering 
course. It seemed to him that very 
few of the graduates were find
ing work readily, so in the second 
month of the semester, after the 
necessary arrangements had been 
made, he switched to the Drama 
Department. As members of the 
stage crew did then, and still do, 
he had to work on stage some
times till 3 or 4 in the morning; 
at the same time he was schedul
ed for an 8:30 class in Hygiene. 
Being the son of a doctor, he 
knew pretty thoroughly the ma
terial covered in the Hygiene 
course. Consequently, after those 
long periods of work into the wee 
hours of the morning, he cut the 
aforementioned Hygiene class. 
And he flunked! He played in the
departments productions of The 
Virgin and the Clerk and Zaragueta in which he had the lead. 
He was very wefl received in these 
plays. Chester Wallace, then head 
of the Drama department, recom
mended that he go to the Acad
emy of Dramatic Arts in New 
York.
Bob, or Charles at that time, 
graduated from the Academy and 
tramped Broadway only to find 
that English actors were in de
mand. Leslie Howard, Herbert 
Marshall, Edna Best and Clive 
Brooks were the mainstays in the
theater at the time. Bob decided 
the only thing to do was to make 
himself an Englishman. I-Iis moth
er gave him an insurance policy, 
cash value $600, which was the 
last money he was able to get 
from home. With the money he 
went to England, learned the ac
cent, the dress, the customs and 
idiosyncrasies of the British 
Then he wrote to agents on 
Broadway, telling them that he 
was an English author and actor 
and would like to act in America. 
Pie got no immediate results, 
however, so he came back to Am
erica. He retained his English ac
cent and clothes, and even drove 
about in a right-handed car. Fin
ally he was cast in Galsworthys, 
The Roof. Next he appeared in 
Earl Carrolls Vanities, Strange 
Orchestra, Wild Oats. He act
ed as straight-man for Milton 
Berle for one year in New York, 
and on the road for eight months.
His radio obligations included 
an appearance on the first Fred 
Allen program, and two broad
casts with Jack Benny. He was a 
regular on the Sherlock Holmes 
broadcasts, doing a different char
acter part each week.
He went on tour with the Ziegfield Follies, and while on the 
west coast he was given a screen 
test in Hollywood. This time the 
demand had changed to American 
actors. They didnt call for Eng
lishmen anymore; it was the com
ing of the OBriens, the Cagneys, 
the Bogarts. 1-Ie went back to New 
York with the Follies. He and his 
wife then bought a station wagon 
and drove back to Hollywood. 
Luck still seemed against him. 
Finally, he heard from an agent 
that producers were looking for 
a Texan to cast in So Red the 
Rose. He applied for the job 
our Englishman now becomes a 
convincing Texan-and success
fully passed the producer and di
rector who said, he was. the. only 
real Texan they had interviewed. 
It was finally disclosed that Bob 
wasnt a Texan, but King Vidor, 
a Texan himself, said he was so 
convincing and earnest in trying 
for the part, that he insisted he be 
retained in the cast.
Two years ago Bob was starring 
on the radio with Nari Grey in 
Those We Love. Later when 
producers were casting for Three 
Smart Girls Grow Up, Nan sug
gested they try Bob for the part 
which he won. This role, opposite 
Deanna Durbin, gave him his first 
real break in the movies. His 
latest pictures were Spring 
Parade, with Deajnna Durbin, 
and One Night in. the Tropics, 
with Allen Jones, Nancy Kelly 
and Mary Boland. He was sched
uled to start work yesterday on 
his 42nd picture.
Still interested in aeronautics, 
Bob started flying in 1937, and 
now has his own plane.
Discussion of Edit 
On Kuufinaim Strike 
Continues Tonight
A motion to oust the editor of 
the Carnegie TARTAN climaxed 
a long discussion by Student 
Council of the editorial on the 
Kaufmanns strike last Tuesday 
i'?,1,1' The motion, made b> Jim 
Wills, was tabled at the request 
ot Les Culleu and will be voted 
on tonight.
The editorial in question was 
the one entitled Kaufmanns 
Charity Does Not Begin At 
Home  which appeared in the 
November 26 issue. Discussion on 
the subject was opened by Wil
liam Jamison, Chairman of the 
Publications Committee, who read 
a letter from Herbert Reich, Bus
iness Manager of the TARTAN 
resigning from his position. Her
bert said in his letter that he felt 
he could not remain on a paper 
with such a scurrilous editorial 
Policy, even though he should 
like to continue his service to 
Tech. His resignation had been 
unanimously accepted by the edi
torial staff of the TARTAN Bill 
also read a letter that President 
Doherty had written to Edgar J. 
Kaufmann, president of Kauf
manns, in which ho apologized 
for the editorial. President Doher
ty said that the repercussions that 
occur from such articles are tho 
penalties of the free press.
When Mr. Shntzkln was called 
upon to discuss his policy, ho suff/rested that Mr. Reich state his 
easo first, so that all the griev
ances could be answered at once. 
Herberts arguments wore that: 
(I) ho was never consulted about 
tho policy of tho paper other than 
the advertising policy which lie 
handled himself: (4) u. mots that 
Mr Shat/.kln had presented in his 
article wero grossly misrepresent
ed and deliberately designed to 
favor only one side. He presented facts that he claimed wore tho 
accurate ones; (3) the editorial 
was not a subject of Interest to 
the Tech Students and (<l) t|. 
editorials jeopardized all chances 
ol getting downtown departmentndvei'tislng for the TAItrAN; and (5) both the nature and 
the lone of the last editorial vi
olated all points of editorial restriction.
Mr. Shntzklns answers were

One of last years Men About

Then we saw Ed Hunt and Ruth

Jane Mogford complains that

meeting men at Techand where 
is that Transfer club this year, 
anyway?
John Hogarth must be quite 
the fellowhe was deluged with 
invites for the Guild dance (well 
two or three at least). It must be 
his western accent!
We extend late congratulations 
to Mary Lou Crago, who changed 
her name to Taylor last Septem

from her home in Chicago. Good 
luck, Mary Lou!
We notice that Dolores Hainan 
has announced her engagement 
to the Duquesne U. graduate.
Pat Spooner seemed to enjoy 
herself hugely at the Phi Kappa 
tea dance! We wonder why!
Reqent news flash! Mary Sul

on the same campus for 2Vz years, 
suddenly found each other.
Virginia Bennett seems to flit 
from one to the other. Why not 
settle down with a reliable oak 
for a while, Ginny? OK?
Just so there' will be no mis'take we hereby wish to announce 
that the following characters are 
entirely fictitious and any resemblences to anyone living or dead 
is surely coincidental. So there!
Will someone . please tell us 
whether or not Patty I-Iaislip went

Orchids to Kay Laboonher 
latest stunt was a flying trip to 
the Army-Navy game. Thats 
what we call smooth.
Conspicuous by their absence 
at all Tech dances are Alix "Son

the with-holding of your radiant 
(?) personalities, gentlemen?
The years first Pledge dance 
at the Phi Kappa house was quite 
a success. The boys cooked up a 
little Apache party which gave 
everyone a chance to break loose 
and dress like he felt. Incidental
ly, Bill Minkel and Joe Pash turn
ed out with dates from Trinity.
Just where does Bob Ferrenzs 
heart lie? One week he dates 
Mary McCarthy, freshman Mag

of MMs pretty Alphas.
Overheard by Operator X-21 
Nelson Crooks and Bill King lay

It sounds crazybut lets see how it would be 
perfectly possible in the telephone business.
Suppose an improved method is devised that 
clips just one second from the time required 
to handle one toll ticket in the accounting de
partment. Apply this method throughout the 
Bell System  handling an average of some 
55,000,000 toll tickets each monthand itwould 
effect a monthly saving of nearly 1% years!
A second saved here, an unnecessary step 
cut out thereon such close attention to 
"little things rests the Bell Systems ability 
to provide the finest, fastest, cheapest tele
phone service in the world.

We would like to clarify some of the questions raised in 
the discussion of the editorial on the strike at Kaufmanns De
partment Store which appeared in the last issue of the TAR
TAN. In the first place, we feel that President Doherty and 
the Administration of the college are entitled to an apology 
for the embarrassing position in which the editorial' seems to 
have put them. We certainly had no intention o: placing Dr. 
Doherty in the position of feeling it necessary to write a per
sonal apology to Mr. Kaufmann. That the tone of the editorial 
was such as to make it appear to some to be a personal attack 
on Mr. Kaufmann is something we sincerely regret. What was 
intended was a criticism of the policies which the management 
of that store followed in dealing with their employees.
Some misunderstanding resulted from the fact that it was 
not specifically pointed out whose opinions the editorial was 
meant to express. In that editorial, as in every editorial that 
ever appeared in the pages of the TARTAN, the opinions ex
pressed, unless.it is otherwise stated, are those of the editor. They 
are of course not necessarily those of either the students or the 
Administration.

the yearbook or accept them, 
said the faithful roommate, think
ing all the time, He isnt going 
to buy any pictures anyway, so 
they might as well take them 
now.
After this , rather unpleasant 
start, the poor salesgirl tried to 
make everything rosy by raving 
about the wonderful pictures that 
were in store for John I and John 
II. John I, being no beauty to be
gin with, discovered that his pic
tures were no worse than he ex
pected, being a fairly unbiased 
reproduction of his face. But John 
II, who was reasonably good look
ing, had a real treat in store for 
him. The girl removed what was 
supposedly his folder from the file 
and' removed the proofs from the 
folder. Without looking at them, 
so she might not spoil the effect, 
she handed them to John II, with 
the question, Youre excited, 
arent you? Not especially, was 
John IIs typical engineering an
swer. Something in John IIs eyes 
caused the clerk, who was watch
ing his face to see the look of 
pleasure that was sure to result, 
to make a grab at the proofs. 
There, in front of her, were four 
pictures of a middle-aged woman. 
A search was made but no one 
could unearth the proper proofs; 
and so John II must either be
come resigned to having the pic
ture of a middle-aged woman in
serted in the yearbook, or go 
through the usual one hours wait 
all over again. John II has only 
one tiling to say: I want my

Brain Teaser
Two bicyclists are riding their 
bikes around a circular parkway 
eight miles in circumference. At 
the same instant they start toward 
one another along the parkway 
from directly opposite points, the 
first at ten miles per hour and the 
second at fourteen miles per .hour. 
At the same moment a crow which 
has been sitting in a tree at the 
center of the circle begins to fly 
straight toward the first cyclist 
with a speed of thirty miles per 
hour. When he reaches the first 
cyclist the crow changes his course 
immediately without any loss of 
time and flies toward the second, 
then back toward the first, and so 
on, until he is caught between the 
two bicycles and gets his neck 
rung. Since the crow is always 
flying directly toward a moving 
objective, he flies in curved paths, 
which do not follow the parkway, 
of course. How far, then, will 
the crow fly before he is grounded?

THE CABNEGIE TASTATSSPAY, DECEMBER 1.0,. 1940
Council Discusses Tartan
editorials would be prefaced with 
the notice that they were the 
opinion of the editor alone.
Jim Wills then said that anoth
er solution of the controversy was 
the resignation of Mr. Shatzkin, 
and he so moved. But because 
he felt that this extreme measure 
was unfair, in view of the appar
ently satisfactory settlement of 
the discussion, and, in agreement 
with this view, Les Cullen moved 
that the motion be tabled, so that 
consideration could be given it 
by a committee of. three, headed 
by Mr. Jamison. Council will vote 
on the matter, therefore, tonight 
at 7:00.
Before adjourning, the ques
tion of Herbert Reichs resignation 
.was brought up again. Since it 
had already been accepted by. the 
TARTAN staff, the acceptance: or 
refusal was now in Council's 
hands. Jim McGarvey suggested*, 
however, that Council should not 
vote on his resignation until the 
matter is settled tonight. This mo
tion was carried, and adjournment 
followed.

He stated that Tech students 
anust consider themselves mem
bers of the community as well as 
members of the campus; must be 
prepared to give careful consid
eration to community problems.
William Floyd summed up the 
objections to the editorial by ask
ing the editor three questions: (1) 
were you justified in writing the 
editorial? (2) should it have ap
peared in the TARTAN?; (3) will 
you continue to write editorials of 
such a nature? Mr. Shatzkin said 
that he felt that he had already 
answered these questions but re
peated that, although he felt that 
the article was justified because 
of its direct interest to,the com
munity, he regretted the fact that 
it caused embarrassment to Presi
dent Doherty.
In the discussion that followed, 
several members of Council, Bill 
Heilman, Les Cullen, Jim Mc
Garvey, and Jim Wills, question
ed the editor about the status of 
an editorial and its representative 
value. Mr. Shatzkin explained 
that an editorial is meant to rep
resent only the editors opinion, 
but since a misunderstanding of 
the point was evident, the future
Continued from, page 1 
students have contact, the strike is 
of general interest to the Tech 
community; (2) downtown de
partment advertising was impos
sible to get because the Retail 
Merchants Association, of which 
Kaufmanns was the leading spir
it, would not permit any department-store advertising; (3) the 
editorial would never have been 
written had he realized that it 
would bring embarrassment to 
the Institute or to President Do
herty; (4) the only reason he had 
written the editorial was because 
the Pittsburgh newspapers would 
not print any news about the 
strike, because of the power of 
Kaufmanns advertising, and 
therefore he felt it was his duty 
to bring the facts to light. Ap
parently his article had the de
sired effect since Mr. Kaufmann 
had consented to negotiate with 
the strikers on Wednesday,
Mr. Shatzkin further pointed 
6ut that he considered the editor
ial completely in line with the 
policy of President Doherty and 
the administration of encouraging 
the feeling of social responsibility 
among Tech engineering students.

Show Strength 
In Initial Tilts
At 7:30 last Monday, in the 
mens gymnasium, the starting 
whistle of the clash between the 
Citcom Clan and Welch Hall sig
nified the opening of the Intra
mural Basketball season. Spark
ed by diminutive Paul Loved ay, 
the Clan had little trouble in 
crushing the stalwarts of Welch 
Hall to the tune of *13 16 7. On 
the far court a thrilling game was 
staged between the Printers 
Devils and Boss Hall. This game 
was a nip and tuck affair with the 
Printers coming out on the long 
end of a 22-21 count. In the 8:30 
game the Scobellites found AICHE 
an easy opponent and trounced 
them 35-19.
The fraternity league opened 
on Tuesday night with a four 
game program. In the openers 
Theta Xi won over the Pi Kap
pa Alphas last, years title hold
ers, in a low score game, 24-11. 
In the far court the D. U.s, one 
of the potentially strong teams in 
the circuit, badly smashed the 
Kappa Sigs to the tune of 41-9. 
Equally one-sided was the DeltPhi Kappa tilt, the boys from 
Delta Tau winning 36-5.
On Wednesday evening the in
dependent league again swung in
to action, the Newmanites, a new 
team in this season played the 
Electrical Engineers to a stand
still only to find that they were 
to win on a forfeit anyway. A 
hotly contested game between the 
Metallurgists and the Sophomore 
Engineers left the second year 
men on the short end of a 44-252 
score.
THISTLEDOWN
FINAL GAME: SKIBOS VS. DUKES
: r-.i,  By Bill Floyd, Sports Editor ---------------
BASKETBALL GAME TONIGHT
Footballs Finished
With the blowing of the final whistle after theDuquesne 
game, the Tech gridders ended their 1940 football season. To 
many Skibo rooters, this season has been a gloomy one. However, 
even out of the thick fog of defeat' several bright shafts of out
standing prowess emerge. First, the back-breaking work ot: 
Doctor Baker and his staff of football strategist's in working with 
an under manned squad; secondly, the stellar ball-playing of 
many of the members of the Plaid team; and finally, the out
standing job of field-generalship turned in by Speedo Friedlander, the Tecliites5 Major Domo, on the playing field. If pos
sible, the Tech student body should rise up as a body and give a 
resounding cheer to those men, players, coaches, faculty, and in
terested friends and alumni who have done all in their power to 
produce a winning football team.
1941 Football Schedule Announced
Through the graduate managers office has just come the 
football schedule for next season. Still lacking one game, at 
home, on November 15, the schedule is as follows: Sept. 27,
Westminster College at Pgh.; Oct. 4, Delaware University away;

Hannums Boys on the March
Tonight at 8:30 in the bleacherized Tech gymnasium the 
Skibo cagers open their 1940-41 basketball season. The battle 
this evening is with the Techmens usual opening opponentsthe 
Waynesburg Yellow Jackets. The visiting aggregation brings a 
veteran squad led by Coach Wolff, well packed with adequate re
serves; while the Plaid hoopsters will present an inexperienced 
floor five with only one veteran performer in the starting lineup. 
The Skibos will be led by Captain Burch, known to his associates 
as Tippy Toes. The starting five will probably be, Burch and 
Brinn, forwards; Patton, center; and Henessey and Neiderberger, 
guards.
Lets all come out and boost our sqiiad toward more baskets 
with more, and more, and possibly a little more, noise. 
Intramural Fives Start Tossing
During the past week, Mr. Eyman and his, group of subofficials inaugurated the current seasons Intramural basketball 
competition.. Initial wins were chalked up for the DUs, Citcom 
Clan, Delts, and Printers Devils. Top form was shown by the 
men of old DU, and the men from the commuters group, these 
two squads looming as possible finalists in their respective divi
sions. Time and an abundance of baskets will tell the story.

Hockey Squad 
Wins, Loses 
Initial Games
On both Friday and Saturday 
evenings last week-end, Techs 
hockey squad took to the ice. The 
inexperienced Tartan icers were 
defeated 3-1 Friday night by Penn 
State at Johnstown. Techs only 
goal was made in the first quar
ter by sophomore Vern Evans with 
an assist from Rollo Block. But 
on Saturday night the tune was 
changed with a Tartan victory 
of 2-0 over Greensburgs amateur 
team in a practice game.
A sound foundation for Techs 
hockey hopes are found in Block, 
Buchanan, Feiler, and Slvachck 
the four returning lettermen. Bob 
Simpson, our new coach from 
Michigans 1933 hoclccy team, has 
put out a fine squad considering 
the meager amount of practice 
which they have had.
Three Seniors, 
Two Sophs On 
Starting Lineup
By George Tondorf
Tech rooters will get their first 
glimpse of the Tartan hardwood 
representatives tonight when 
Coach Max Hannums boys go into 
action against the highly-touted 
Waynesburg five. The Skibo squad 
is one of the biggest question 
marks in the local basketball pic
ture'. It is sure to be one of the 
fastest aggregations ever to don 
the plaid, making up for its lack 
of heighth by slick ball handling 
and fast-breaking plays.
Three Seniors and two Sopho
mores will start on the first-string 
line-up. Captain Red Burch and 
Dave Brinn will be on the firing 
line in the forward positions, 
while Herb Neiderberger and 
Herman Itch Hennessy, both 
Seniors, will hold down the guard 
spots. Sophomore Wally Patton, 
at center, rounds out the first 
five for the Scots.
On the second team are for
wards Hugh Smith and Kermit 
Patton. The latter, a letter man 
from last season, is due to gradu
ate in February, which will not 
help the Tartan cause one bit. At 
the center post is gridder Hank 
Holets, who, judging from his 
past court performances, will be 
elevated to the first-string before 
the current campaign is very old. 
Frank LePage one of the most
improved players on the team and 
Vince Alexander, the set-shot ex
pert, will take care of the guard 
positions.
Waynesburg Team Tough 
Boasting the second best ag
gregation in the district last sea
son, the Waynesburg quintet 
should prove a hard nut to crack 
for the Tartans opening fray. The 
visitors have three regulars re
turning from last years team, and 
should the Skibo unpredictables1 
hurdle this first barrier they will 
be well on their way toward a suc
cessful campaign.

Techniters 
Christmas Eecess
sburg Group 
To Sponsor Dance
Techniters Hold 
Many Functions 
Throughout Year
The Greensburg Carnegie Tech
niters will hold their annual 
Christmas Hop on Saturday, De
cember 21. The affair will be held 
in the Walworth Gymnasium, 
Greensburg, Pa.
The dance will start at nine 
oclock and last till the infinite 
hours of the morning. Last years 
dance lasted till four, and they 
have hopes of having this years 
last longer. Refreshments will be 
served by the Walworth Cafeteria.
The Greensburg Carnegie Tech
niters is an organization of stu
dents that commute from the 
Greensburg district several nights 
a week. The group banded togeth
er several years ago to obtain 
transportation from their homes 
to school. Groups of the organiza
tion share expenses to and from 
school. The fortunate owners of 
cars ferry the less fortunate ones.
A meeting was held by the 
group as school commenced in the 
Fall, and in the Spring an annual 
banquet is held. The commuters 
do not limit their membership to 
Tech students. Their membership 
is also gathered from Duquesne 
and the University of Pittsburgh.
This years officers are: Sam 
Webb, president; Richard Shields, 
vice-president; Burrell Mason, 
treasurer; Emil Mehrer, secretary. 
The dance committee for the 
Christmas Hop is headed by Jack 
Gibbons and his committee, con
sisting of: John Charlesworth,
Morris Ramsey, Arthur Killner, 
Burrell Mason and James Allegro.
The commuters have asked the 
Evening Student Council for rec
ognition on the campus, but this 
will take two years, as the Coun
cils constitution requires a twoyear probation period.
Annual Council 
Hop Attracts 
Large Crowd
Middlemans Style 
Proves Acceptable 
To All Dancers
Evening Student Council held 
thoir annual Thanksgiving Tur
key Feathers" Ball Thursday eve
ning, November 20th from nine 
until one, in the Mens Gymna
sium. A large group was present 
making their Thanksgiving recess 
complete.
Everyone enjoyed the sweet 
swing supplied by Herman Mid
dleman and his orchestra. Love
ly Shirley Heller was the vocalist. 
This is one of the better known 
name bands in the Pittsburgh 
vicinity. They have had extend
ed engagements at downtown 
night spots, the Nixon Cafe and 
the Yacht Club. Orchestrations 
included waltzes for the less mod
ern (Engineers) and swing for the 
jitterbugs (Art Students.)
Colorful crepe paper decorations 
covered the basketball rings and 
dark corners, and were illuminat
ed by the various colored spots. 
As traditional as the dance itself, 
the Crystal Ball hung high in the 
ceiling turning endlessly on its 
pivot.
We were especially pleased to 
see that the majority of young 
ladies wore long dresses, which 
added that certain touch of fem
inine atmosphere. We hope you 
sweet young cherubs will continue 
to dress up. It really gives the 
boys something nice to remember.
Turkey Feather programs, col
ored Pompoms and gay colored 
corsages were presented to the 
first 200 couples.
The Black Cat, located under 
Thistle Hall, where refreshments 
of a light nature may be pur
chased, proved to be a cozy re
treat at intermission.
This Turkey Feathers Ball will 
go down in Evening School his
tory as one of the most successful, 
most enjoyable evenings we have 
had the privilege of attending.

Who is the engineer who com
mutes between Wilkinsburg and 
Monongahela City every week
end, rain, shine, fog or ice to see 
his red-haired lass? Its that dash
ing gent named Arnold Anex.
Woid comes to us that Wes Berkoben is a mighty proud papa 
since Nancy Lou came into the 
family.
Another engineer who has add
ed nursery rhymes to his text
books is handsome Joe Rymer. He 
is also a proud papa since the 
arrival of Diane Lois. Congratu
lations to you, Joe and Wes.
Did you see Chuck Bricker 
dancing under the Crystal Ball 
all evening at the Thanksgiving 
Recess Dance? If he thought it 
was a moon, we couldnt blame 
him.
Don Kleckner, former Engin
eering President is now working 
for Curtis-Wright in New Jersey, 
while Alan Steele, another stu
dent engineer is working for 
Pratt and Whitney.
What engineer or two would 
like to become better acquainted 
with a certain Helen from up New 
Kensington way?
Some of the instructors in the 
math departments should follow 
the splendid example set by Mr. 
Hoover. His students all agree 
that lies one of the finest instruc
tors they ever had. He has a real 
understanding of their problems 
and expresses a real spirit of co
operation at all times.

Christmas?
Another Recess 
Date Is Changed
If you wake up with a hang
over the evening of January 1st 
and it continues into the evening 
of January 2nd when you have 
classes to attend, dont worry. You 
can now cut the class with impu
nity. Why? Well . . . because 
Christmas vacation is scheduled 
to extend from December 20th to 
January 6th instead of from De
cember 19th to January 2nd. 
With the dates of the Thanksgiv
ing and Christmas recesses being 
changed, we wonder whats going 
to happen when Easter comes 
around.
Yuletide Ball 
Features Music 
By Palmer
Engineers Change 
Dance To Dec. 21
Kay Denton will sing for us at 
the Engineers Christmas Ball to 
be held on Saturday, December 
21st, instead of December 14th as 
hasbeen previously announced. 
Kays songs will be sung to the 
sweet music of Dan Palmer and 
his eleven-piece orchestra, signed 
to play from nine until twelve in 
the mens large gymnasium.
In changing the date of the 
dance from December 14th to the 
21st, the Engineering Officers felt 
that they would be favoring the 
greatest majority of their fellow 
students, since^by leaving a week 
between this and the previous 
dance, interest would be greater, 
and since the new date is closer to 
Christmas, more friends of Engi
neers (home for the Holidays) 
could attend.
Dan Palmer played for the Engi
neers two years ago, and was very 
favorably received. Since that 
time, he has played at the Balconades, Churchill Valley Golf 
Club, and the Edgewood Club; and 
and on the Pitt, Penn State, Du
quesne and P.  C. W. campuses.
The dance will be known as a 
semi-formal a flair, that is, girls 
will be encouraged to wear formal 
gowns, but their escorts need not 
wear tuxedos.
Admission is free to all students 
registered in the Evening Collep' 
of Engineering, and one dollar 
couple to others.
All those who attended the last 
dance must have noticed the in
crease in the number of young 
lassies wearing those long, slinky, 
but oh so beautiful, dresses. Now 
that a trend has been established 
by those hardy pioneers, it is hop
ed that more gals will join the 
crowd and go glamorous.
All those who noticed the in
crease in long dresses must also 
have noticed the intensive scrutiny 
to which the young ladies were 
subjected, especially by the mem
ber of their own sex. Yessir, each 
one was given the once over in 
much the same way as we men (?) 
observe one of our fellow beings in 
a classy uniform. Now if the las
sies react the way most men do 
(we always say, I think, Ill bet I 
would look better than that( with a 
uniform on)well see a steary 
increase in the number of dress
makers delights at our future 
dance.
Long dresses are definitely suit
able for Tech dances. Of course 
I shouldnt like to say that they 
should be worn to every dance 
Im afraid that would necessitate a 
raid on fathers or hubbies pocketbook, and they have enough to

Social Fraternity 
Danced To Music 
Of Ches Walters
Members of Phi Nu and their 
friends gathered in Thistle Hall 
last Saturday evening to enjoy the 
fraternity annual Christmas 
Dance. The old timers renewed 
campus associations, and compar
ed notes on the changes which 
have taken place since they were 
mere youngsters.
To provide music for the affair, 
Phi Nu brought back to the cam
pus one of the students old favorities, Ches Walters and his or
chestra. Ches has played for 
many other engagements on the 
campus, but seldom were his mel
odies more heartily welcomed or 
thoroughly enjoyed.

Classes Must 
Be Dropped 
Before Dec. 11
The Administration announces ' 
that December 11 is the final date 
to drop all subjects. Before that 
time, students should indicate to 
their instructors whether or not 
they wish to continue any of their 
present subjects. If you feel that 
your classwork is unsatisfactory, 
you can drop a study now. By do
ing this, there can be no grade 
given. If the class is continued 
and the work still unsatisfactory, 
the teachers is obliged to give you 
a failing grade.

Plaid Seeks 
Opinions for 
Dance Attire
Because of the great amount of 
interest which has been created by 
the current questions of whether 
or not the young ladies should 
wear long or short dresses to the 
Tech dances, the Plaid has decided 
to poll the students on the subject. 
We want the students to fill out 
the form below, put it in an en
velope, address it to the Editor of 
the Plaid, Box 353, and place it in 
the inter-school mailbox, next to 
the book store in the Administra

publish the results each week.
