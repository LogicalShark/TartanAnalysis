University slips in 
U.S. News rankings
By HEATHER DIETRICH
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
- In its annual pronouncement, U.S. 
News & World Report announced its 1998 
college rankings to a nation of eager 
parents, high school students,-and col
lege administrators. In this years list
ing, CMU is ranked 25th in a four-way tie 
with Tufts University, the University of 
California at Los Angeles, and the Uni
versity ofMichigan at Ann Arbor. Harvard 
and Princeton are joined by Yale this 
year, in a tie for first place.
With changes in weighting each year, 
fluctuation in the rankings is inevitable, 
which makes it difficult to gauge how the 
universities compare to each other.
[It is] a mistake to think of the 
rankings in a linear fashion because 
there are only slight differences between 
the top twenty-fivessaid Don. Hale, 
vice president of University Relations. 
Any slight weighting difference can al
ter the placement. Hale also said that 
CMUs administration does not take the 
rankings too seriously as a device to 
evaluate the quality of the University, 
and that what is important is the consis
tent recognition as one of the best uni
versities in the United States.
Many CMU students have a similar 
outlook. Dannielle Cisneros,'a sopho
more modern languages major, thinks 
that the U.S. News rankings do not 
carry much weight. Cisneros says that 
our ranking does not affect her opin
ion of the school at all.
We should be ranked higher 
because our programs are good; we 
dont get the recognition we deserve, 
she said.
Martin Sweitzer, fifth-year social 
and decision sciences major, thinks 
that the way U.S. News rates colleges 
is skewed and incorrect. Sweitzer 
pointed out that all of CMUs indi
vidual colleges and programs are 
ranked very highly, although it is 
only ranked 25th overall.
U.S. News is attempting to com
bine many factors to get an ubernumber, and that number ends up not 
being a good indicator of the quality of 
the school, he said. Their ranking 
system just doesnt work.
To rank the schools, U.S. News 
uses 16 subfactors that are grouped 
into 7 major categories. The final 
rankings are based on the schools 
scores in the categories of academic 
reputation, student selectivity, fac
ulty resources, retention rate, finan
cial resources, alumni giving, and 
graduation performance. The data is

Officials appoint vice provost
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Why are you putting up with this? 
Im so boring! said Indira Nair to her 
students in the middle of teaching a 
Radiation, Health, and Policy lecture 
10 years ago. She did not know it at the 
time, but re-evaluating education was 
to become her full-time job.
Nair, who has been a CMU faculty 
member for 20 years, was appointed 
vice provost for education by a search 
committee in late July. Former Vice 
Provost Ed Ko resigned last April to 
take a position at the City University of 
Hong Kong.
Since being appointed, Nair has spent 
much of her time in meetings with other 
CMU administrators, such as Bill Elliot, 
vice president for Enrollment, and Jeff 
Bolton, vice president for Planning and 
Business. Ive been learning a lot from 
each person about what my job entails 
and how it mingles with theirs, said 
Nair. Their assistance, Nair said, is help
ful as-she adjusts to her new position.
[My job description is] to promote the 
cause of education. What does that mean? 
Its nice to go back and ask yourself 
fundamental questions about what it 
means to broaden education, said Nair.
Nairs responsibilites include help
ing implement the Universitys Strate
gic Plan, which was re-evaluated last 
year. Ive been trying to understand 
the motivations behind it and also some

of the wording, said Nair. She was not
involved in the formation of the plan, 
so therefore she has been consulting 
some of the same administrators 
about the history behind the Strategic 
Plan. One of the statements [the Stra
tegic Plan] makes is that we have to 
deliver extraordinary value to the stu
dents. But what does that specifically
mean, and how do you do it?
Part of the plan calls for a broadening 
and balancing of students educations. 
As associate head and associate profes
sor in the Department of Engineering 
and Public Policy (EPP), Nair has been 
active in doing just this since she ar
rived at CMU. EPP is a major that

A year ago, the only indication 
of the Purnell Center for the Arts 
was a gaping hole next to Warner 
Hall, but the large structure has 
quickly taken shape. In June the 
final steel beam was put into 
place, marking the completion of 
the steel erection.
Construction of the Purnell 
Center is on budget and on sched
ule. According to Tom Murphy, 
director of capital projects for the 
University, construction crews 
encountered nothing out of the 
ordinary this summer and were 
therefore able to stick to their 
schedule and budget. The build
ing, which will eventually house
the School of Drama and other 
CFA schools, is still expected to 
be completed in the fall of1999. It 
would then open for the public by 
November of next year.
Construction on the $30 million 
building began last September. 
By November 1 the windows, re
maining exterior bricks, and the 
roof should be complete. On the 
interior, walls are being put up.
The Purnell Center is the last 
building in the campuss master 
plan, which has included major 
construction projects such as the 
University Center, Gesling Sta
dium, and the parking garage. 
The final phase of the master 
plan will be the North Wing of the 
Purnell Center, which will run in 
front of Warner Hall and mirror
the University Centers covered 
walkway along the Cut. Accord
ing to Murphy, this wing is in the 
design phase and has not yet been 
approved for construction.
The Purnell Center is not the 
only construction slated for the 
campus, however. Two floors will 
be added to both Building D and 
the Field and Mobile Robotics 
Buildings, and the structures will 
be connected. A bridge will also 
connect the fourth floor of Wean 
Hall to Building D. Steel erection 
on this project is slated to begin 
in early October and continue 
until the fall of 2000.
Other projects are in the plan
ning phases, but are scheduled to 
begin construction within a year. 
An additional floor will be added
to Posner Hall. The building was 
originally designed with the in
tent to add this additional floor.
Currently an architect is being 
selected for this project; construc
tion should begin next summer.
Baker Hall is also lined up for 
an addition. Preliminary work is 
being done on a three-story wing 
which will be added to the Frew 
Street side of the building. A final 
budget has not yet been approved, 
but construction may commence 
as early as next summer.
Construction on another build
ing on campus, Roberts Hall, has 
finished phase two, which included 
completing the first and second 
floors over the summer. The 
buildings occupants moved in at 
the beginning of the school year. The Purnell Center is scheduled for completion in November, 1999.

No relief in sight for 
strike-weary travelers
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Travel
ers grounded by the Northwest Air
lines pilots strike waited hours for 
alternative flights, rushed to rent cars, 
or went hundreds of miles out of their 
way Saturday to get where they 
wanted to go.
Both the airline and the pilots union 
said they were willing to resume nego
tiations that broke off shortly before 
the 6,100 pilots struck, but there was 
no indication when that would happen. 
The union rejected a last-minute com
pany offer shortly before their strike 
deadline of 12:01 am EDT Saturday.
Im not going to play games about 
whos going to call who, but clearly 
these guys walked out, Northwest 
spokesman Jon Austin said. They 
have to walk back in.
It kind of takes two to dance, said 
Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the Air 
Line Pilots Association.
Airports were quiet at the three cit
ies where Northwest controls more than 
three-quarters of the air traffic: Minne
apolis, Detroit, and Memphis, Tenn.
The airlines gray and red baggage 
trailers were lined up empty in neat 
rows on the tarmac, and baggage car
ousels were idle. Banks of computer 
screens were blank under Arrivals 
and Departures.
In Memphis, clerk Michele Nash 
stood at her cash register at the 
Graceland Gifts and Tours shop on the 
main concourse with little to do. By 
midday, she had sold one Elvis Presley 
refrigerator magnet, a shot glass, and 
a pack of matches.
Im ready to go home, Nash said.
Northwest is the nations sixth larg
est airline in terms of passengers and 
its fourth largest in terms of revenue. 
It carries nearly 150,000 passengers a 
day and 2.9 million pounds of cargo on 
1,600 flights in North America, Eu
rope, Asia, and India. Cargo service 
had been halted on Thursday.
Before the strike started, Northwest 
had canceled 400 flights for Friday 
and Saturday, giving many passen
gers time to rearrange their plans. 
Only 15,000 passengers traveled
through Minneapolis on Saturday, 
down from the usual 80,000, said Jeff 
Hamiel, executive director of the Met
ropolitan Airports Commission.
That advance notice didnt work 
for everyone.
Scott Johnson, who was trying to get 
from Japan to Canada, spent the night 
at the Tokyo airport after his flight 
was canceled. He finally caught a plane 
to Detroit, and tried to get to Chicago 
in hopes of connecting to Toronto.
I figured I would just wing it, he 
said as he slumped in his seat on the 
airport shuttle bus.
United Airlines added an extra flight 
from Minneapolis to Chicago on Sat
urday to take up some of the overflow.
While Northwests pilots walked 
picket lines outside, other employees 
remained at work at counters to help 
passengers get to their destinations. 
They are among the airlines 45,000 
workers who will probably be laid off if 
the strike drags on.
Ted Needham, in Memphis, was try
ing to get his daughter, Amie, back to 
New York, where she attends law school. 
He had hoped to switch her ticket for a 
Tuesday flight to another airline.
They said her flight is not canceled 
yet so we have to come back and go 
through this hassle again Tuesday 
morning, Needham said.
Many rented cars to make shorter 
trips  or tried to.
Budget Rent-a-Car in Minneapolis 
ran out of cars for one-way rentals and 
turned people away.
The demand is too high, reserva
tion agent Bill Graves said.
President Clinton, who halted a 
strike by American Airlines pilots last 
year by ordering a 60-day cooling-off 
period, took no action and urged both 
sides to continue bargaining.
The union had said that tentative 
agreements were reached on most con
tract issues, but not on job. security 
and compensation.
Northwest pilots say they earn an 
average salary of about $120,000 per 
year. The airline says the average sal
ary is $133,000.
R&D facility finds 
home in Pittsburgh
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Seagate Tech
nology Inc., the worlds largest manu
facturer of computer disk drives, is build
ing a $30 million research-and-development center in Pittsburgh in hopes of 
enhancing its position in the datastor
age market.
The Scotts Valley, California-based 
company, which announced its plans Mon
day, leads the market but lost $530 mil
lion last year in the wake of falling prices 
for computers and their components.
The new center will be overseen by 
Mark Kryder, a professor who will leave 
his post at Carnegie Mellon University. 
A location has not yet been chosen, but it 
will be housed in temporary quarters by 
the end of this year and is predicted to 
employ 100 people by the middle of2001.
Traditionally, Seagates strength has 
been the efficient manufacture of disk
drive components, with sales approach
ing $7 billion last year. That success 
came not through technology but by 
being able to manufacture technology 
well, Kryder said. This is quite a change 
of direction for them.
Kryder, 54, is also the director of the 
Data Storage Systems Center at CMU.
The announcement comes a bit more 
than a month after Seagates board of 
directors asked for the resignation of its 
founder, Alan Shugart. He was replaced 
by former company president Stephen 
Luczo as chief executive officer.
Report predicts 
water shortage
WASHINGTON (AP) - The world will 
grow 'more thirsty and unstable in the 
next generation as the number of people 
facing shortages of fresh water swells to 
2.8 billion, according to a private study.
To reduce demand for drinking water 
in the future, the report from The Johns 
Hopkins University School of Public 
Health recommended that countries con
serve water, pollute less, manage sup
ply and demand of water better, and 
slow population growth.
It also said most countries need mas
sive investments in sanitation and wa
ter supply infrastructure.
A water-short world is an inherently 
unstable world, said the report released 
Wednesday. To avoid catastrophe ... it
is important to act now to slow the growth 
in demand for fresh water.
Now, nearly half a billion people dont 
have enough drinking water. That num
ber is expected to increase to 2.8 billion 
people by 2025  or 35 percent of the 
worlds projected 8 billion people, the 
report said.
Today, 31 countries, mostly in Africa 
and the Near East, are facing water 
stress or water scarcity. By 2025, popu
lation pressure will push another 17 
countries, including India, onto the list. 
China, with a projected 2025 population 
of 1.5 billion, will not be far behind, said 
the report.
A country faces water stress when 
annual fresh water supplies drop below 
445,090 gallons per person. Water-scarce 
countries have supplies of less than
262,000 gallons per person.
Although much of the world is trying 
to meet a growing demand for fresh 
water, the situation is worst in develop
ing countries where some 95 percent of 
the 80 million people added to the globe 
each year are born. In addition, the 
competition among industrial, urban, 
and agricultural uses for water is mount
ing there, the report said.
In many developing countries, lack of 
water could cap future improvements in 
the quality of life, said Don Hinrichsen, 
the reports lead author and a consult
ant with the U.N. Population Fund.
Populations are growing rapidly in 
many of these countries, and at the same 
time per capita use must increase  to 
grow enough food, for better personal 
health and hygiene, and to supply grow
ing cities, Hinrichsen added.
Yet there is no more fresh water on 
earth now than there was 2,000 years 
ago, when the population was less than 
three percent of its current size, he noted.
Even in the United States, which has 
plenty of fresh water on a national basis, 
groundwater is being used at a rate 25 
percent greater than its replenishment 
rate, said the report.
The report warned that regional con
flicts over water could turn violent as 
shortages grow. And as people use more 
water, less is left for vital ecosystems on 
which humans and other species depend. 
Globally, over 20 percent of all freshwa
ter fish species are endangered, vulner
able or have recently become extinct.
According to the report, California has 
lost over 90 percent of its wetlands dur
ing the past two centuries, causing twothirds of the states native fish to become 
extinct or be in decline.
Web site tracks 
dead celebrities
MOUNT LEBANON, Penn. (AP) - 
Wondering if the kid who played Mikey 
in those Life cereal commercials actu
ally died? How about Sally Struthers or 
Ricardo Montalban?
To titillate the morbidly curious, a 
suburban Pittsburgh woman is keeping 
tabs on whos cold  and whos very 
much alive, just dead in Hollywood  on 
her Web site, the Dead People Server.
Its informative and amusing, said 
Laurie Mann, 41, of Mount Lebanon, who 
maintains the site. If you dont see some
one regularly, suddenly theyre out of 
sight, out of mind, and youre like, Gee, 
whatever did happen to Chet Huntley?  
Answer: He died March 20,1974.
I try not to get overly morbid about 
it, said Mann, a technical writer and 
trivia buff. Its irreverent.
Entries include Dick Clark, who was 
born November 30, 1929, and remains 
immortal; Kenny of televisions South 
Park, who dies in every episode; 
Struthers, who is alive but appears to 
have a dead career; and John Tesh, who 
is alive, although some Dead People 
Server fans remain hopeful.
Although some of the entries seem 
harsh, Mann said, If you dont offend a 
few people here and there, youre prob
ably not saying anything.
Celebrities are listed alphabetically, 
and some include links to other pages 
with home pages and biographies.
The site also debunks false death re
ports, like the one about Bob.Hope that 
started in June. An Associated Press 
obituary being prepared in the event of 
Hopes death moved inadvertently on a 
Web site, prompting a congressman to 
mistakenly announce his death on the 
floor of the House. Hope, very much 
alive, survived to be awarded a papal 
knighthood a few days later.
Philip Kain, a net culture expert for 
the New York-based Mining Co.  which 
mines the Internet for the best informa
tion on different subjects  said odd 
sites like Manns thrive in cyberspace.
The Web gives people the power to 
indulge their eccentricities, show off their 
quirks, and indulge themselves, said 
Kain. The net allows you to find a very 
specific niche of information.

~lmann/dps.North Carolina residents dig through Bonnies wreckage
SWANSBORO, N.C. (AP) - 
Most of eastern North Carolinas 
, crop of tobacco, sweet potatoes, and 
' peanuts seemed to have survived 
the brunt of Hurricane Bonnies 
blast without major problems. 
Not on Don Sweetings land. 
Here we go again, Sweeting 
said Friday as he gloomily 
scanned his 53 acres of with
ered, wind-beaten tobacco in 
eastern Onslow County. We just 
had this two years ago. So its 
been tough.
As Governor Jim Hunt and 
other officials tramped through 
his fields during a tour of the
storm damage, Sweeting, 37, said 
he had completed just one 
harvest run before Bonnie hit. 
Fortunately, his crop was insured, 
he said.
Its kind of a bad life, Sweeting 
said. But its what Ive done all 
my life, and its what I know. Ive 
got so much in it now I would hate 
to get out.
From Wind-raked fields of to
bacco to flooded basements, North 
Carolina residents assessed 
the toll on their property and 
their emotions.
Bonnie didnt pack the wallop 
that Fran or Bertha delivered in
1996  Fran plowed through 
the middle of the state and 
caused $5.2 billion in damage 
and 24 deaths.
Bonnie, which did between $1 
billion and $2 billion in dam
age, stalled and delivered 
drenching rains. Jacksonville 
got 10 inches.
Seveial feet of water flooded 
low-lying streets in Elizabeth City 
and hard-hit Outer Banks towns 
when Bonnies 115 mph winds 
and lashing rain blew ashore late 
Wednesday afternoon.
I made out pretty good, said 
Almey Gray, 63, who rode out the
storm in his 116-year-old house 
in Stumpy Point. Ive been here 
so long Im used to it. What made 
this one so bad was it lasted 
so long.
Down the road, Jay Ross was 
picking up the pieces of his sea
food business. His tubs for pro
ducing soft shell crabs were 
gone and his driveway was 
washed out.
We have a dock thats gone, 
but I think every dock is gone, 
Ross said.
At Topsail Beach, four feet of 
sand was piled along a street. 
Windows in some homes were
plastered with so much sand it 
resembled spray-on Christmas 
snow. The worst property dam
age appeared to be washed-out 
stairs, battered boat docks, 
stripped roof shingles, and 
ripped siding.
I hate Bonnie, said Surf City 
resident Hoyt Bradshaw, who 
returned to his home and found 
that the storm had ripped the 
solar panels off his roof. But I 
dont hate Bonnie as bad as I 
hated Fran.
Pastor Don Horn was counting 
his blessings. Bonnie only blew a 
gable off his Surf City Church.
Fran was a big, terrible bull
dog compared to what Bonnie is, 
Horn said, his feet squishing in 
the soggy carpet behind the last 
row of pews. Bonnie was just 
like a little kitty cat.
Still, some savvy North Caro
lina residents werent ready to 
unpack just yet. Another poten
tial visitor, Hurricane Danielle, 
is churning just a few hundred 
miles off the coast.
Tm not putting everything back 
until I see what Danielle does, 
said potter Ellen Roberson, whose 
gallery was still soaked with about 
42 inches of saltwater.

Carnegie Almanac
from National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, September 
17, 1948  Though hazing had 
been discontinued for years, 
freshmen at Carnegie Tech were 
treated nothing like the fresh
men of today.
New students were given infor
mation about the school and cam
pus during registration week. They 
were then required to pass the an
nual Traditions Examination with 
a grade of 70 percent or better.
Additionally, freshmen were 
required to purchase freshman 
dinks which they had to wear 
in public during their first 
month at school, a duration 
known as freshmen regulations 
period, which ended after 
Homecoming weekend.
The purpose of all these activi
ties was said to be the comple
tion of their assimilation into the 
Carnegie Tech community.
25 YEARS AGO, September 
18,1973  Tuition increases are 
nothing new to Carnegie Mellon. 
Over the summer of 1973, the 
1974-75 tuition was raised $400 
to $2,900. The increase was a 
problem for students because of 
higher housing costs and a pro
liferating inflationary trend.
Students in 1973 were obvi
ously opposed to the increase, but 
there had not been a hike in 
CMUs tuition during the three 
previous years.
On the other hand, today it is 
almost a given that tuition will 
increase annually. Last spring, 
the Board of Trustees approved a 
$1,270 increase for the 1998-99 
academic year.
TEN YEARS AGO, Septem
ber 7, 1988  The times have 
changed in the world of comput
ing. The college of Humanities 
and Social Sciences named the 
Apple Macintosh II as its stan
dard personal computer and sug
gested to all its incoming fresh
men to purchase one.
Apple donated 60 Mac II work
stations to the college. The dona
tion was worth about $500,000 to 
the school. With most of its fac
ulty using the Macs, H&SS rea
soned that it would be easier to 
provide educational media out
side the classroom and to share 
information if its students also 
owned a Mac.
Today, however, Apple is no
where near the computing pow
erhouse it once was. Representa
tive of the Macintoshs more lim
ited role at CMU, H&SS replaced 
all Macintoshes in its cluster with 
new Pentium II computers last 
summer.
FIVE YEARS AGO, August 
30,1993  It was not much of a 
rarity that 80 students were stay
ing at the Holiday Inn near the 
beginning of the semester. What 
was odd was that University 
Housing said it was likely that 40 
of those students would have to 
remain there the entire semes
ter. Though the hotels distance 
from campus was an inconve
nience, the residents there did 
enjoy benefits such as a pool.
ONE YEAR AGO, September 
2, 1997  University officials 
revoked their decision to termi
nate the lease of the Kappa Sigma 
fraternity. The brothers there 
may not drink or possess alcohol 
in their house for another year.

engineering students may take in addi
tion to their primary major. Its purpose 
is to balance engineering students edu
cations by urging them to think criti
cally about the ways technology and 
society are interlinked.
One thing that greatly concerns me, 
said Nair, are students who graduate 
from Carnegie Mellon and automati
cally choose to work for the highest 
bidder without thinking about the moral 
and ethical consequences. Students 
need to think about their principles and 
ideals and then ask themselves, Am I 
giving and using my knowledge for the 
things that I believe in? 
Nair originally came to CMU in 1978
after seeing a classified advertisement 
for a temporary position. Her original 
intentions were to work at CMU while 
she continued to try to find a real job. 
But instead, Nair was named the assis
tant department head a year later. She 
became associate department head and 
a senior lecturer in 1981.
In a statement to the University, 
President Jared Cohon and Provost Paul 
Christiano noted Nairs importance in 
the development of EPPs curriculum.
Nair earned her bachelors degree in 
physics and mathematics from the Uni
versity of Bombay in 1960, her masters 
degrees in physics first from the Univer
sity of Bombay and then from Kansas 
State University, and her PhD in physics
from Northwestern University in 1972.
A popular teacher among students, 
Nair said she regrets that her new ap
pointment will not allow much time for 
a role she has taken since she was 
young. In her native India, she was the 
eldest of four children and always felt a 
natural pull towards teaching. There 
were always younger children around. 
Id help them with homework just be
cause I was older, Nair said.
Nair feels that the true rewards as an 
educator come 10 years down the road 
when a thank you letter from a former 
student arrives in the mailbox. A true 
test of a good education, she said, is 
whether or. not you can retrieve the 
knowledge when you need it.
Carnegie Mellon In Brief
CMU contributes 
to telescope fund
Carnegie Mellon University, in con
junction with Rutgers University, the 
South African Government, and sev
eral European universities, will be con
structing a nine-meter class telescope 
in South Africa. The telescope, named 
the Southern African Large Telescope 
(SALT), will cost $20 million and is 
scheduled to be completed in 2003. Car
negie Mellon is contributing $6 million 
to its construction.
The telescope will be used to study the 
formation of galaxies in the early uni
verse, massive black holes, and to search 
for planets around nearby stars.
Renovations incur 
semesters delay
Student Governments scheduled reno
vations of the Morewood Basement have 
been delayed by about a semester. Al
though Student Body President Sarah 
Gross had hoped to complete renova
tions over the summer and have the new
social, space and eatery open this fall, 
construction could not begin because 
the Carnegie Mellon Child Care Center 
was using the space over the summer. 
Plans to remodel the space are continu
ing, and Gross said that Student Gov
ernment will try to complete the project 
this semester and open it at the begin
ning of the spring 1999 semester.
Students interested in contributing to 
the renovation and decorating project 
can contact Gross at sgross@ 
andrew.cmu.edu.
Campus institute 
gets new director
Janet Stocks, associate director of the 
Engineering and Public Policy 
Departments Center for Integrated Study 
of Human Dimensions of Global Climate 
Change, will be replacing Jessie Ramey 
as the director of Carnegie Mellons Un
dergraduate Research Initiative.
Stocks earned her doctoral degree 
from the University of Pittsburgh in 
sociology and has specialized in areas 
such as educational research, gender 
studies, the sociology of knowledge, and
global environmental change. She 
earned bachelors and masters degrees 
from Oberlin College.
The Initiatives many programs include 
the Small Undergraduate Research Grant 
(SURG) program, the Ethics in Research 
program, and the annual Undergradu
ate Research Symposium. The Institute 
has expanded greatly under the director
ship of Ramey, with its SURG program 
increasingfrom eight participants in 1990 
to over 800 last year.
Stocks begins her job on September 1.
CMU announces 
Posner addition
As the Purnell Center rises over Warner 
Hall and Building D is transformed into 
a new home for the School of Computer 
Science, Carnegie Mellon is planning 
more construction on campus.
With the help of a $2 million donation 
from the Germany-based Robert Bosch 
Company, CMU will add a third floor to 
Posner Hall, home of the Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration (GSIA). The 
administration anticipates that the reno
vations will cost $5.4 million.

tional resources to students. Adc$tionally, the residential areas 
tat each CR is responsible for 
Kave changed; with the new 
groupings of residential build
ings, two new CR positions were 
added to bring the total from 
five to seven.
 Because it is such a new place, 
\yere trying to get acclimated and 
learn the culture as best we can, 
said Hippensteel. She said, how
ever, that the new staff hopes to
retain practices that have been 
beneficial to students in the past.
[CMU] seems really fastpaced, said Hippensteel. Theres 
a lot going on  people are always 
bustling.... It keeps me energized. 
And thats one of the reasons I 
wanted to come to CMU.
I think the new CRs are doing 
really well in that theyre not 
wiping out what weve done pre
viously, said Helen Wang, a se
nior psychology and creative writ
ing major and second-year com
munity advisor (CA). Theyre 
learning from what weve done in
the past, but also bringing in a lot 
of new ideas.... Everyones been 
really flexible on both ends. 
This year has also seen a dra
matic expansion of the Greek Peer 
Advisor program. Greek Peer 
Advisors (GPAs) serve as liaisons 
between the Student Life Office 
and fraternities and sororities, 
filling roles similar to those of an 
RA. The Student Life Office has 
attempted to increase the num
ber of GPAs in order to provide 
guidance to Greek students. Only 
three fraternities do not have 
GPAs this year.

These administrators then

The ranking is comprised

academic reputation (25 percent), 
and faculty resources (20 
percent). According to the 
U.S. News Web site (http://

the number of students who re

(worth 80 percent of the score) 
and how many freshmen return

for their sophomore year (20 per
cent). CMUs graduation rate is 
only 72 percent, and freshmen 
retention is 91 percent, which 
results in a low score for this 
important element. CMU earned 
a score of 4.2 out of 5 possible in 
the academic reputation category. 
By comparison, Harvard, Yale, 
and Princeton had scores of 4.9.
The faculty resources score 
counted such elements as class 
size, faculty compensation, fac
ulty with doctoral degrees, full
time faculty, and the student-faculty ratio. CMU comes in twentysecond place in this category.
For the final 35 percent of the 
overall ranking, CMU is ranked 
as follows: student selectivity 
(worth 15 percent of the total) at 
26th place; financial resources 
(10 percent) at 20th place; and 
alumni giving (five percent) at 
24th place. CMU also overesti
mated its six-year graduation rate 
by 9 percent, leaving it ranked 
24th in a category worth 5 per
cent of the total score.
The rankings are helpful in 
that they provide an aggregation 
of interesting statistics, but they 
are not a reliable indicator of how 
good schools are, said Sweitzer.

Crime and Incident Report
8/22 DISORDERLY CONDUCT, 3:31 am  A fraternity 
brother was sleeping in his room 
when he heard fireworks com
ing from the driveway in be
tween his and a neighboring fra
ternity. Several minutes later 
he heard an object hit and break 
his window. He called Campus 
Police to report the incident. 
Warnings were issued to both 
fraternities, and a maintenance 
request was submitted to have 
the window replaced.
8/24 THEFT, 12:29 pm - A 
white male with spiked hair set 
off the University Shoppe secu
rity alarm as he exited the store. 
A salesperson asked the male to 
stop, but he did not respond to 
her requests and continued to
wards the fraternity area. The 
woman hit the panic alarm, but 
Campus Police could not locate 
the suspect.
8/24 THEFT, 1:38 pm - A 
graduate student arrived at his 
Hamerschlag Hall office to find 
his Sony cassette player, its 
accompanying headphones, 
and four of his CDs  by art
ists John Denver, Joan Baez, 
Bryan Adams, and Richard 
Marx  missing. The student 
was sure that he locked his 
door when he last left his office, 
which he shares with other 
graduate students. The other 
students who share the office 
did not know what had hap
pened to the player or the CDs.
8/24 SUSPICIOUS PER
SONS, 7:25 pm  The Univer
sity Shoppe manager grew sus
picious of two males who had 
been in the store three separate 
times during the same day, each 
time wearing different clothing. 
When he saw them for the third 
time, he contacted Campus Po
lice. The store manager also 
stated that he recognized the
two from a previous incident at 
the store.
One ofthe stores personnel saw 
the two near the bookstore lock
ers. She stated that the one who 
had been waiting there said, 
Wheres the book you were get
ting for me? The other replied, 
[expletive], I didnt get it, 
and shes onto me. Additionally, 
both actors had asked one of the 
sales clerks when the book buy 
back was.
An officer observed one of the 
actors step out into the hallway 
to meet the other. At this point, 
the officer stopped the actors. He 
explained the reason for the stop 
and informed them that a record 
of the stop would be made. He 
also advised both students not to 
engage in any illegal acts. The 
actors were then released.
8/24 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF,
10:10 pm  A faculty member 
was using a stair stepper in the 
University Center exercise room 
when he saw three suspiciouslooking white males pass the door
way. One of the actors was taking 
pictures with a black camera and 
another threw a glass vial into the 
room. It hit the floor and the fac
ulty member realized that it was a 
stink bomb.
The faculty member contacted 
Campus Police so that the smell 
and the mess would be cleaned 
up. The manager of Ali Baba also 
noticed the three actors before 
the attack, but a search of the 
area for males matching the given 
descriptions proved negative. 
CPS mopped up the small puddle 
of the liquid.
8/25 INSTITUTIONAL VAN
DALISM, 9:26 am  As she was 
cleaning Donner Hall windows, a 
CPS employee saw a disturbing 
message on the front window. An 
unidentified actor had written 
KILL USA on the window in 
what appeared to be blood. The
writing was removed.
8/25 THEFT, 9:52 am - An 
unknown actor opened and emp
tied the female napkin dispenser 
in the first floor womens room 
in Baker Hall. The thief left a 
note that read, Corporate 
America will not use our body. 
Help yourself, Ladies.
8/25 THEFT, 12:00 pm - The 
Baker Hall computer cluster re
cently received a major upgrade 
when all the Macintoshes were 
replaced by new PCs. However, 
when the cluster reopened last 
Monday, it contained one less 
computer than intended. Be
tween August 18 and 21, some
one stole a computer and its accompanyingmonitor. Computing 
Services believes the thief had a 
key to the area, so an order to 
change the locks has been placed.
8/28 THEFT, 9:40 pm - A 
freshman went to use his bi
cycle, which he had parked be
neath Hamerschlag House. He 
discovered that someone had 
removed his cable lock but left 
his bicycle intact. Campus Po
lice reported that five other 
cable locks and bikes were sto
len this past week.
 Campus Chief of Police 
James LaPaglia reviews all re
ports prior to release.
 Only three people on The Tar
tan staff see the reports: the editor-ih-chief the news editor, and 
the staffwriter typing the report.
 All personal names of com
plainants, victims, suspects, and

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University31 August 1998
IFC must change 
irresponsible policy
Policing drinking on college cam
puses is a serious issue  look at 
all of the alcohol-related riots that 
sprang up this summer at schools 
across the country. For reasons 
like this, different college groups 
adopt formal policies in order to 
protect themselves and students 
from the altercations that some
times result from drinking irre
sponsibly. Butwhathappens when 
a groups policy is irresponsible?
Such is the case with the cur
rent Interfratemity Council (IFC) 
alcohol policy. Certainly there 
have been many steps taken in 
the past few years to ensure a 
safer drinking environment at 
CMU fraternities, and the IFC 
Bring Your Own Beer policy has 
done much to place reasonable 
restrictions on drinking in frater
nities. However, for all that the 
IFC has accomplished with re
quiring guest lists and requiring 
those guests of legal drinking age 
to furnish their own alcohol, 
theyve overlooked one major 
point: A guest attending a CMU 
fraternity party is allowed to bring 
12 beers or wine coolers. Thats 12 
drinks per person for that 
evenings activities. Thats also 
well over twice the limit of what is 
considered binge drinking.
The expression binge drinking 
is being thrown around the media 
so much that its becoming noth
ing more than an empty way to 
talk about college students hav
ing too much of a good time. But 
there are reasons that the act of 
drinking more than five drinks in
one sitting has become a buzz 
phrase of the moment: among the 
consequences are severe illness, 
hospitalization, and death.
Justin Chambers is one reason 
why binge drinking is becoming a 
growing concern. He was a CMU 
student who died in 1994 with a 
Blood Alcohol Level of .54, over 
five times the legal limit. He died 
because of binge drinking, and he 
is only one of many across the 
country at universities like CMU.
Some students are going to 
drink, whether they are of legal 
age or not, to think otherwise 
would be foolish. But concrete 
steps need to be taken to provide 
as safe an environment for hav
ing fun as possible. The IFCs 12- 
drink policy is irresponsible. If 
their argument is that they dont 
think party attendees will con
sume 12 drinks in one sitting, 
then why is the limit so high in 
the first place? Especially if the 
students at their parties follow 
another rule of the IFC alcohol 
policy: An attendee of legal drink
ing age can bring beverages only 
for his or herself, not to share 
with friends.
With some revision and better 
enforcement, the IFCs BYOB 
policy could be effective in cur
tailing the chance of more alcohol-related tragedies happening 
on campus. Most limitations of 
the IFC policy are reasonable if 
they are enforced regularly by the 
IFC risk managers and brothers 
of fraternities. But a 12-drink 
limit just doesnt make sense.

MXL.C M~/
University sends 
mixed messages
^ NathanSteSnwald
Last November in Japan, 
the United States negotiated 
the Kyoto Protocol on Global 
Climate Change. The treaty, 
which is designed to halt glo
bal warming by reducing net 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
received some press, then 
faded from the national 
consciousness.
To date, it has still not been 
signed by the President and 
given to Congress to either 
ratify or reject. The reason 
for this is that everyone in 
Washington knows that right 
now, Congress would reject 
the treaty.
Never mind that the over
whelmingly dominant scien
tific opinion is that global 
warming is happening and 
that humans are at least 
partially responsible. Never 
mind that warming could 
shift climate zones, disrupt 
agriculture, and wipe out 
coastal areas and island 
chains that do not rise high
above sea level. The Kyoto 
Protocol still will not be 
passed, or even voted on, by 
the current Congress. It may 
not even be voted on until 
after the 2000 presidential 
election, and the way things 
look now, it might 
not get passed then.
The political 
firestorm that is 
brewing in Wash
ington promises to 
be a long one. Nei
ther side is willing 
to concede very 
much yet, and this 
is a problem that is 
not going to go 
away because poli
ticians refuse to 
vote on it.
There isnt any
thing wrong with 
political debate. It 
is how we as a na
tion make up our 
minds, or at least 
come to a short
term compromise, on conten
tious issues. But this issue is 
special. It requires that we re
examine our lives in a num
ber of contexts and face the
real possibility of changing the 
way we do some things for 
a long time. If we fail to, then 
the decisions we make now 
will probably be wrong 
and come back to haunt us in 
the future.

Global warming is essen
tially a product of how energyintensive our lives are. From 
our cars and our heating and 
air conditioning to our computers, we live energy-inten
sive lives. Everything we do 
requires energy, and around 
the world, more energy Has 
translated into a higher stan
dard of living.
The need to reduce energy 
usage presents a 
problem because 
people like the way 
they live. They are 
reluctant to give 
things up. And what 
is a greater problem 
is that certain 
people and corpora
tions make a great 
deal of money off of 
how we live.
The oil industry, 
the auto industry, 
the coal industry  
all of them are lin
ing up against the 
Kyoto Protocol and 
lining the pockets of 
politicians who are 
willing to side with 
them. Groups like 
the American Petroleum In
stitute and American Enter
prise Institute who oppose 
the Kyoto Protocol are both

Sometimes, especially when 
starting out in college, decisions 
can be difficult to make on your 
own. It doesnt help when the 
University presents its students 
with ideals to strive for and then 
endorses contradictory behavior.
Some scenarios bluntly counter 
the ways to succeed that the Uni
versity presents to students. For 
example, a first-year student at
tends an Orientation alcohol and 
drug presentation entitled, 
Whats the Buzz About? given 
by Health Educator Jeff Lauzon 
and Associate Dean of Student 
Affairs Paul Fowler.
She then returns to her dorm 
room, where her RA hands her a 
College Kit cup. Inside, she finds 
a flier advertising the All-YouCan-Drink Parties Every Night! 
awaiting her this Spring Break. 
Sow, the student can form her 
jwn opinions, but the mixed mes
sages that she is receiving from 
University sources dont offer 
nuch in the way of help.
Then there are the vendors who 
orcefully solicit students, someimes begging them to sample 
verything from body jewelry to 
iredit cards. According to Marcia 
3erwig, director of the Univer
sity Center, these vendors arent 
nvited by the University  they 
solicit the University for what:ver space they can get.
But while Gerwig claims the 
Jniversity tries to limit the numoer of credit card vendors to one
at a time, there are usually sev
eral companies across campus 
vying for students attention, 
sometimes offering free prod
ucts to entice students to sign up 
for something or other. Even 
Gerwig admits that in the past, 
some vendors have been so 
aggressive in pushing their prod
uct they have been asked not 
to return.
Aside from simple harassment, 
students are being lured into po
tentially high-risk financial situ
ations by some of these vendors. 
If students really feel responsible 
enough to have a credit card, 
they have ample opportunity 
to fulfill that desire at their 
own bank or some other off-cam
pus establishment.
But some students are not ready 
to handle the responsibilities of a 
credit card. By listening to the 
short, pro-credit speech given by 
campus vendors and signing up, 
they risk getting into 
a situation that could result in 
serious debt.
It is up to all students to indi
vidually make intelligent deci
sions based upon their personal 
values. Yet contradictions be
tween what the University says 
and what it does dont provide the 
kind of support that makes it easy 
for students to come to such deci
sions. The University should send 
out consistent messages on topics 
regarding students well-being 
and success.
Downtown Pittsburgh lacks urban vitality
Editors Notebook
by Rebecca Fribush
Going to school in a big city means 
having all kinds of resources at your 
fingertips. Youre somewhere thats 
teeming with things to do and provides 
you with numerous ways to take advan
tage of them. Right? So I thought when 
I decided to come to Carnegie Mellon. 
But the longer Ive been here, the more 
Im becoming convinced that, while Pitts
burgh may have introduced me to such 
wonderful concepts as the french fry 
sandwich and the pronoun yinz, its 
not very adept at providing the sort of 
opportunities I was expecting.
Its not that theres nothing cool to do 
 downtown areas offer museums and 
theaters, not to mention interesting 
neighborhoods like the ethnic-marketlined Strip District. But theres not as 
much as there should be, and what there 
is never quite manages to be open when 
it should be. On one recent Saturday 
night, my date and I spent two hours 
downtown looking for open stores or 
restaurants. Even the ubiquitous 
Starbucks coffee places were closed, for 
goodness sakes.
Besides, without a subway system like 
most big cities have, getting anywhere is 
a pain. Before our desperate search for a 
restaurant that Saturday, we had gone 
to the Heinz History Center. The center 
was fascinating  too bad that by the 
time we determined which bus to take, 
spent the better part of an hour cooling 
our heels at the curb before the bus
actually arrived, and inched up Liberty 
Avenue in the slowest PAT bus on record, 
we got there not long before it was sched
uled to close for the day.
There are perfectly good reasons for 
downtown Pittsburghs lack of resources. 
Blame economic and demographic fac
tors. The once-dominant steel industry 
has disappeared. The city is trying to 
recover from this and transform its 
economy by attracting more high-tech 
jobs, but this is a slow process. So people 
have left in droves, and businesses with 
them. Also, younger Pittsburgh residents 
have followed the nationwide trend of 
fleeing farther and farther into the sub
urbs. From 1980 to 1990, according to 
the 1997 City and County Extra, the 
population of Allegheny County as a 
whole decreased 6.9 percent, but that of 
Pittsburgh itself decreased by nearly 
twice that. Which explains why 
Monroeville Mall seems to close later 
than downtown Pittsburgh.
A further consequence of this flight to 
suburbia and to other areas is that the 
region now has a disproportionate share 
of the only people who arent likely to 
move  the elderly. According to a re
cent In Pittsburgh article, Allegheny 
Countys population is currently older 
than that of anywhere north of Dade 
County, Florida. And most 75-year-olds 
are hardly the type to go out regularly 
for a night on the town.
There certainly are sections of the city 
itself that offer the vitality youd expect 
from an urban area. But they 
counterintuitively tend to be outlying 
areas like the South Side. CMU students 
should know. Oakland, Shadyside, and 
Squirrel Hill are among the areas of 
Pittsburgh that have the most to offer. 
These three neighborhoods are also the 
most convenient ones for students at CMU 
and Pitt. Businesses there can thrive and 
afford to keep long hours because of all
the students looking to procrastinate by 
shopping or catching a movie. And of 
course, theres the techie factor. Not sur
prisingly, a lot of the high-tech research 
and industry that Pittsburgh is staking 
its hopes on is associated with CMU. 
Which means that newly rich geeks spend 
a lot of time in these neighborhoods and 
can afford to frequent their shops and 
restaurants. Squirrel Hill and Oakland 
prove that Pittsburgh can support dense 
areas of things to do. But they also show 
how much that ability depends on a ready 
population who can and will take advan
tage of them.
While rerouting the economy and try
ing to attract a younger population are 
long-term initiatives that cant be solved 
very quickly, there are more concrete 
things Pittsburgh can do to jump-start 
its downtown. The city is taking some 
steps in the right direction with its plans 
to energize downtown by developing a 
new Lazurus department store, a 10- 
screen movie theater, and other stores 
and entertainment. It could also look into 
expanding its light-rail system substan
tially to provide a more efficient way to 
get around the city. As it stands now, the 
trains only travel to five stops downtown 
and to the South Hills suburbs, and a 
proposal is in the works to expand it to 
the North Shore. This is a good start, but 
it would be even better if the system 
reached into other parts of the area.
These development proposals are only 
in the planning stages now, and its 
uncertain how successful theyre be even 
if they become reality in the next few 
years. But we can only hope theyll im
prove Pittsburghs downtown. As it 
stands now, its just the pits.

Missile strike launches debate over ethics
Questionable motives inform attack
Open Forum
by Lorelei Laird
If, as some critics suggest, the recent 
missile attack on Sudan was meant to 
distract the countrys attention from the 
Lewinsky scandal, it failed. Open a news
paper and it tells how various political 
figures are reacting to Clintons confes
sion speech; open Time and theres ex' tensive reporting, complete with timeline 
and charts, on The Stained Dress. In the 
opinion sections of the countrys newspa'pers, there are editorials and letters ga
lore dissecting just what this may mean 
to Clinton, the presidency, and the trust 
level of the people. Meanwhile, while 
'were all busy telling each other how 
little we care about the Presidents sex 
;;life, our government is killing people in 
'Sudan and Afghanistan.
It seems that Washington has forgot
ten one of the basic principles learned in 
rehildhood  two wrongs dont make a 
right. Yes, it was awful that two of our 
{embassies were bombed for no reason, 
Jbut how can that justify attacking an 
apparently unrelated pharmaceutical 
/plant? (The target of the Afghanistan 
.strikes, which was actually a terrorist 
camp, makes those strikes an entirely 
..different subject.) Yes, there were trace 
elements of a component of nerve gas 
;found in the Sudan plant  a chemical,
, according to the internationally-based 
Organization for the Prohibition of 
{.Chemical Weapons, that also canbe used 
|in the manufacturing of certain medica
tions. Tellingly, the London Observer 
reports that the U. S. government knew 
i that the factory was civilian. So, while 
; its possible that we may have destroyed 
a chemical weapons factory, its certain 
; that weve committed an irrevocable act 
, of violence against innocent people.
Just as importantly, no terrorists.were 
hurt. Seen from the Sudanese point of 
: view, this attack came from nowhere,
! two years after their government was 
' nice enough to throw out Osama bin 
 Laden at our request. Now 10 Sudanese 
: have been hurt, and half the countrys 
I drug supply has been reduced to rubble.
 In the meantime, our newspapers are 
reporting indignantly that bin Laden 
; and more reasonable Muslims are mad 
i at the U. S. Surprise! Im not saying that
nothing should be done to combat terror
ism, but its smart to ensure youre actu
ally combating the terrorists.
Which brings up the less important 
matter of how this all looks to the world. 
It doesnt take a foreign newspaper to find 
people who are suspicious of the timing of 
the attacks  just days after Clinton 
admitted that he had improper relations 
with a White House intern. Critics trans
lation: The president cant keep his dick 
in his pants, so hes waving it at Africa as 
a distraction. Or, hes desperately search
ing for a way to look like hes backing up 
his promise to fight the terrorists by point
ing a missile at the first Muslim country 
he sees. Even assuming that Clinton seri
ously meant to 
bomb bin Laden 
into submis
sion, Sudans 
eagerness to in
vite U. N. in
spections of the 
site and the con
sistent denials 
and obfuscation 
coming from 
Washing
ton make our 
government 
look incompe
tent and bar
baric. No mat
ter which way 
you slice it, it 
reflects very 
badly on Clin
ton and on the country as a whole.
And speaking of bad publicity for the 
U.S., did the government really think bin 
Laden, nut case though he may be, was 
going to be hurt or impressed by our show 
of power? If our government has any com
petence at all, it knew that he wasnt in 
the factory in the late evening. Bin Laden, 
to be sure, already knew that the U.S. has 
a propensity for throwing its military 
weight around. That was probably a fac
tor in turning him against the U.S. in the 
first place. So what weve done was pro
voke a man who already dislikes us, and 
who has. the.resources to hurt us. Add that 
to Clintons resume of smart moves.
No matter how one views it, it was a 
dumb thing to do. The embassy bombings 
were a tragedy, but to answer violence 
with violence invites more violence still, 
and, in the end, achieves nothing. Every
body involved loses.

Financial interests justify retaliation
Open Forum
by Yishan Wong
On August 20, U.S. ships in the Ara
bian Sea launched a series of cruise mis
sile attacks against targets in Sudan and 
Afghanistan. Recent domestic events have 
cast doubts on the solvency of President 
Clintons leadership of the nation. Bogged 
down with mundane domestic concerns 
like welfare, 
rising criminal 
youth, and ex
tended politi
cal infighting 
with conserva
tive el-ements 
in this coun
try, Clinton 
was made to 
look the fool on 
the interna
tional scene 
when the alle
gations of 
sexual miscon
duct and per
jury rose to a 
climax in the 
last few weeks. 
Tanya Tarr/Tartan Junior Staff But these
doubts about Clintons authority were 
put to rest last week, when the missile 
strikes landed in swift and brutal retali
ation for the terrorist bombing of the U.S. 
embassy in Nairobi that killed 12 Ameri
cans. It shows the depth of American 
resolve, that we are willing to take such 
action that may yet induce reprisal from 
bin Laden and these countries.
These attacks are also a step forward 
for both American business and Ameri
can capitalism. Capitalist societies de
rive their power from the strength of their 
industry and business; the government 
that best serves these interests helps cre
ate a strong and powerful country. Since 
the early days of the industrial era, Ameri
can industry has been driven by petro
leum, and despite oil fields on American 
soil, U.S. businesses have always sought 
to gain access to the rich oil fields of the 
Middle East. Access to this oil lowers 
domestic prices, enabling increased pro
duction of petroleum products and petroleum-run vehicles, one of this countrys 
largest industries. After World War II, as
British dominance in the Middle East 
waned, U.S. interests took over, heavily 
influencing political policy in Middle East
ern nations friendly to the U.S., such as 
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in order to 
secure good trade relations.
But Osama bin Laden and his followers 
wish to push Americans out of the Middle 
East with sabotage and terrorism. In a 
fatwa, or religious edict, issued earlier 
this year, bin Laden exhorts, We  with 
Gods help  call on every Muslim who 
believes in God and wishes to be rewarded 
to comply with Gods order to kill the 
Americans and plunder their money wher
ever and whenever they find it. As a 
capitalist economy, American govern
ment can and should do nothing but listen 
to its driving force  business  and fight 
to maintain a Middle East presence. 
Money talks, and money builds the 
outpouring of material goods that 
Americans enjoy.
A country like the U.S., founded with a 
libertarian government strictly held sepa
rate from religious concerns and granted 
minimal powers (even by todays interna
tional standards), gives control of its ma
terial interests to private parties. That is, 
American businesses can easily control 
the source of Americas power  its indus
try, its production, its money.
Thus, Clintons actions are an expres
sion of the interests of American busi
nesses, who wield and exercise Americas 
real power. Just as he served these inter
ests when he visited China, so he has 
again in these decisive strikes against 
terrorist targets. A capitalist nation 
such as ours listens first to its business 
interests, and second only to factors in
terfering with those interests, like oppo
sition to our presence in the Middle 
East or reports of human rights abuses 
in China.
The retaliatory attacks on the chemi
cal factory in Sudan and terrorist train
ing camps in Afghanistan show that 
American business and government are 
well-unified in their interests, as should 
be the case in the worlds greatest capi
talist nation. It sends a clear message to 
any would-be terrorists that America will 
not be held hostage so long as economic 
interests are at stake, that our economic 
well-being will not stand to be 
threatened by any kind of fundamental
ist opposition.

willing and able to spend a 
great deal of money to advance 
their interests.
The positions of politicians and 
political parties on this issue have 
remained the same since it be
came an issue 10 years ago. The 
difference is that now there is 
something to do  vote for or 
against the protocol  and ev
erything that is wrong with poli
tics is leading the Senate towards 
rejecting the treaty.
This is a time when we need the 
most thoughtful policy we can 
come up with, but we will not get
it because of the power of money 
in Washington.
Already, if one listens closely 
enough, one can hear the Repub
licans testing the water for argu
ments against Kyoto and A1 Gore 
for the 2000 Presidential elec
tion. Whoever wins the presi
dency will have a large part in 
determining the policy of the 
country with respect to global 
warming.
There are some problems with 
Kyoto.itself. The lack of partici
pation from developing nations 
is the largest problem. However, 
the treaty is only for 10 to 14
years. Within this time frame, 
countries like China, India, and 
Brazil will make strides towards 
adding to global warming as much 
as we do, but they wont be 
there yet.
The other problems are with 
our ability to predict the changes 
that will occur, and the costs of 
doing nothing versus doing any
thing. Conventional economics 
doesnt place much value on costs 
or profits that are in the future. 
The problem with this is that if 
agriculture is severely disrupted, 
it will cost more than money  it 
will cost lives.
According to the U.N. climate 
change group, the Intergovern
mental Panel on Climate 
Change, temperatures are ris
ing, and we are the cause. We 
know that there will be some 
effect on the environment. As
signing values of good and bad 
change might be irrelevant, be
cause we need the environment 
to work the way that it does now, 
and we cant afford to have it 
change very much.
To date we have been the larg
est single contributor to the prob
lem of global warming. Despite 
this, the most important contri
bution we can make is to solve 
the problem. By picking up the 
issue, being leaders in the devel
opment of new technology, and 
finding ways to stop global 
warming in a productive way, the 
U. S. will set the stage for devel
oping nations to join our mitiga
tion efforts.
We can do all of this, but only if 
the money and the politics dont 
get in the way.

Look down the bench of the 
womens soccer team this year 
and you will see a number of 
new faces. More than 10 firstyear students are on the team, 
and they have a new coach.
Last year the team only 
had 16 players, and this is 
an unusually large recruit
ment year. Change isnt al
ways a bad thing, though. 
Last years team suffered 
through a scoring drought 
and lost one close game after 
another in a season that was 
marked by too few players 
and a precipitous drop in 
their win/loss record.
This Saturday the team 
played its first scrimmage ofthe 
year, and despite a 0-0 tie, the 
team showed a great deal of 
improvementoverlastyear. We 
did well controlling the ball, 
saidcoachHeather Kendra. We 
moved the ball with purpose. 
Even though we didnt score, Id 
rather have the ball control.... 
The scoring will come.
Senior goalie Lindsay Smith 
and junior Romy Fischer will 
be captains for the team. Both 
expressed optimism for the sea
son, and for working with their 
new coach.
Lindsay and Romy have alreadysteppeditup,saidKendra. 
The [other] girls already look to
them for leadership.
This is going to be one of the 
best years for the womens pro
gram, said Smith. The old 
players are really strong, and 
we got a big pool of freshmen. 
Recruiting got us the numbers, 
but the freshmen talent level is 
really high.
This year under Kendra, start
ing spots arent guaranteed to 
anyone. Whoever earns it plays, 
said Kendra. Startinglineup will 
be up for grabs until the day of 
the game.
This willingness to look at ev
eryone and give them a chance 
at every practice has been wel
comed by the team. Players feel 
comfortable that Kendra under
stands what they are going 
through, and how things are 
working on the field.
Our coach was really smart; 
she minimized the injuries, said 
Fischer. If were tired, shell no
tice and cut practice short so we 
dont get injured. She let me come 
in slowly too, because I had an 
injury in the off-season, and Im 
coming off of surgery for that in
jury. I didnt have to prove myself 
right away.
This year, bolstered by the 
addition of a large class of first 
year students, the team will look 
to improve itself and build 
strenght and skill for the future. 
The new faces have made com
munication and familiarity a 
new concern for the team, but
Tartan File Photo
Tartan womens soccer hopes to improve on offense this season.
in the scrimmage they seemed 
to manage pretty well.
The thing about the freshman 
is that there are so many new 
faces, said Fischer. It takes time 
to get used to.
Smith and Fischer were not 
sure how the season would end 
up, but both thought that the 
team would improve as the sea
son went on. The main focus for it 
will be to improve the scoring.
Optimism for the team will have 
to be tempered this year because of
the strength ofthe UAA as a soccer 
conference. Two teams in the UAA 
are ranked in the top 25 nationally 
among Division III schools, and 
another received votes.
The team will have four games 
to get ready for its first UAA 
opponent, though, and the depth 
on the bench will allow them to 
stay rested during the season. 
During this time theyll have to 
get familiar with one another, 
and with putting the ball in the 
back of the net and winning.Tartans aim for conference repeat

first-team AI1-UAA player. He 
will bolster an already strong 
unit. Sophomore Rashad Gray 
will clog the middle at nose 
guard. Said Lackner, Hes a 
big, strong, physical kid and 
has had a good camp.
Senior Greg Hauswirth came to 
camp in great shape and im
pressed the coaches. Lackner said, 
[He] started last year... and has 
had an excellent camp. Were look
ing for good things from him. 
The linebackingcore is very deep. 
Junior Jesse Grapes was FirstTeam
All-UAA last year. Senior captain 
Chris Schmidt returns in the 
middle. Senior Mike Stango and 
junior Todd Conley have both had 
greatcamps. [The] linebackingcore 
looks solid, said Lackner. Weve 
got some depth at OLB, and weve 
got great depth at ILB.

The Tartan defense smothers a Case Western running back en route to victory last season.
Special teams took a big hit 
when second-team All-UAA 
punter Ray Crux hurt his back. 
He is out for the season. Junior 
Pat OMalley will now handle the 
double duties of punting and kick
ing. He had an inconsistent year, 
but Lackner liked what he saw 
in camp. Lackner said, I think 
his stroke is better this year. His 
leg is extremely strong. Senior 
kicker Matt Jarock is very accu
rate, and may handle extra points 
and short field goals.
Only one starter from the sec
ondary returns this year: first-team 
All-UAA, free safety senior Jason 
Funke. Junior Chris Martinez, an 
oft-used reserve last year, will step 
up at one corner, while the other 
side will be patrolled by senior 
Brian Harris. Battling for the 
strong saftey. position are Matt 
Morris and Danny Flambard.
We think we have the nucleus 
of an excellent secondary, said 
Lackner. I think we had an ex
cellent secondary last year, but 
kids do graduate.... Hopefully 
well reload. Thats what were 
trying to do.
Squad prepares for new year
SOCCER, from page 12
Doug played midfield last year, so it takes 
time to get him used to playing forward, 
said Gaudioso. You dont recruit forwards 
here, you have to make them. As long as Ive 
been here youre never going to get a bigtime forward coming in. Doug has a lot of 
natural ability and heart, so you give him a 
direction to go in and see what happens. 
Jason [Beulow] and Harry [Ulrich] were the 
same way.
The Tartans can still count on their defense to 
be where it was last year. The team is returning 
the entire back line and goalie. Most of the 
entire starting 11 saw a good deal of action last
year, and if they can stay healthy, they should 
improve as a unit.
If the starting 11 cant stay healthy, the team 
might run into problems. Depth is always a problem 
for Gaudioso and the Tartans. Recruitment isnt 
even the only problem. Getting players ready for the 
UAA is another hurdle to be cleared.
Nobody starts sophomores in the UAA. Nobody 
starts freshmen, said Gaudioso. Every team is 
deep and competes at a high level. We have some 
freshmen now who will be good, but they just arent 
ready to step in.
A strong start will ensure that they have a chance 
at the end of the season for a playoff birth. Anything 
less could knock them out of contention quickly.Volleyball team upgrades skill, camaraderie during off-season
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Everything is different from 
last year. '
Those were the words of 
womens volleyball head coach 
Julia Webb. Everything from the 
team atmosphere to the skill level 
has been upgraded in the off
season, and there seems to be an 
enthusiasm in Webbs voice. All 
of our incoming first year stu
dents will contribute a lot of skill, 
she said. The team is really start
ing to play like a unit well.
The new recruits also bring 
height to the team, something 
that was lacking in last years 
squad. The 1997 Tartans finished 
strong after starting 0-19, tak
ing sixth place in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA).
In addition, the team will fea
ture five returning juniors and one 
sophomore, rounding out a young 
but quickly improving squad.
No one is expecting us to be 
where we are now, said Webb. 
We expect to be competitive. 
Losing is one thing. Everyone 
loses sometimes. We are really
working to make sure we dont 
get beat and lose badly though. 
She has set the teams sights on 
bettering last seasons UAA fin-: 
ish by three places.
One of the highlights of the 
season will most likely come at 
the end when Carnegie Mellon 
hosts the University Athletic As
sociation womens volleyball 
championships. I think we may 
surprise some people, said Webb.
I believe we have a shot at our 
first winning season in eight 
years, she said. We hope to have 
some fun too.FASHION ANTIQUE

Exorbitant superstar salary should be put to better use
What the Puck?
by Brian Smith
If you look hard enough, you can find 
an article in just about any popular me
dia source lamenting the alarming esca
lation of professional athletes salaries.
This will not be one of those articles.
Well, at least not totally.
I am instead going to attempt to focus 
on the concepts of Return on Invest
ment and Opportunity Cost of Choice 
 economic principles that have become 
increasingly important in every busi
ness except for that one notable excep
tion known as the National Hockey 
League (NHL).
] Many general managers (GMs) in the 
tNHL seem to have slept though some of
1 (One)  The number of Stanley 
Cups won by the Quebec Nordique/Colo
rado Avalanche since Eric Lindros first 
was drafted by that organization back in 
1989. After refusing to play for the 
Nordique, Lindros was traded to the 
Flyers for five players, a draft pick, and 
$15 million in cash. As a direct or indi
rect result of this trade, the Quebec/ 
Colorado roster would eventually list 
such names as Peter Forsberg, Adam 
Deadmarsh, Andrei Kovalenko, Mike 
Ricci, and Patrick Roy.
2 (Two)  Coaches that have been 
fired by the Philadephia Flyers since the 
Lindros era began in Philadelphia six 
years ago. Terry Murray and Wayne 
Cashman are gone since their systems 
did not mesh with the first overall draft 
picks approach to the game; Roger 
Neilson has since been hired in an at
tempt to give the superstar a more wellrounded playing style.
3 (Three)  The number of teams 
finishing ahead of Team Canada during 
the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. The 
Lindros-captained Canadian team, 
which was favored to win the gold medal,
called upon to lead have never realized 
their full potentials, and he is a hockey 
player known to dive on occasion in 
order to draw penalties rather than 
show the toughness needed to fight 
through a check. One must call into 
question the determination of a 6-foot4-inch, 236 pound hockey player who 
seems to spend more time on his knees 
than a holy man.
Has Eric Lindros been a good invest
ment so far for the Philadelphia Flyers? 
Depending on the criteria, the answer 
could go either way. He has generated 
an excitement for the game that has 
effects reaching beyond the city of Phila
delphia. From an economic standpoint, 
the citys new CoreStates Arena may not 
have been able to be constructed with
out the revenue he as a bona fide superstar generates. He is an eloquent am
bassador of the game and generates fan 
interest in the sport of hockey.
From a hockey point of view, though, 
he has thus far not ushered in the suc
cess that, fairly or unfairly, was sup
posed to have arrived along with him.
Lindros $8.5 million can actually buy 
you a lot these days 
in the NHL. You 
could go out and buy 
yourself a Dominator  Dominik 
Hasek, probably the 
greatest hockey 
player on the face of 
the planet at the mo
ment, receives less 
per year than 
Lindros. Or, you 
could purchase one

Basketball coach 
chairs commitee
Carnegie Mellon womens basket
ball head coach Gerri Seidl was re
cently named chair of the NCAA Divi
sion III Womens Basketball Associa
tion. The appointment gives the vet
eran coach another accomplishment 
to add to a long list of positions she 
has held during her career.
I was very honored, she said, also 
admitting that she was somewhat sur
prised. Its going to be a great oppor
tunity for me.
The committee is mainly respon
sible for the administration of the 
National Womens Di
vision III Basketball 
Championship tourna
ment, including select
ing its 64-team pool.
Seidl began working 
her way though the ranks 
eightyears ago, whenshe 
became a member of the 
Division m regional ad
visory committee, even
tually chairing it in 1993.
This position gained her 
a spot on the National 
Committee. She has 
served on this commit
tee, which she will now 
chair, for five years.
Seidl is edagr to over
see the implementation 
of one of the issues she 
has worked hard for in 
the past  a neutral 
site championship 
game. It will be nice to 
be a part of something
that happens for the Tartan File Photo
first time, she said. Coach Gerri Seidl led CMU to a 9-15 record last year.
Its more of a political position than 
coaching, Seidl said. It will allow me 
to see the *big picture of the sport in 
general whereas, with coaching, you 
concentrate on the little picture of 
your team.
According to Seidl, Athletics Di
rector John Harvey has been a key 
influence in her pursuit of the chal
lenges that come with her new posi
tion. These positions involve a large 
amount of work, and Dr. Harvey has 
given me a lot of encouragement. 
Seidl will serve a two-year term, 
beginning this season.

jtheir most basic business classes on their 
way towards controlling the purse strings 
{of their respective teams. As a case study 
}of a recent example, the Philadelphia 
:Flyers GM Bobby Clarke just re-signed 
] center Eric Lindros to a contract exten
sion. Just for the sake of immediate dis
cussion, let us ignore for now such intanIgibles as scouting reports and reputa
tion, and instead look just at things that 
ican be expressly quantified by numbers: 
j 0 (Zero)  The number of Stanley 
jCups won by the Philadelphia Flyers 
.organization within the tenure of their 
\highest-paid superstar, Eric Lindros. Co)incidentally, this number also repre
sents the number of playoff series from 
\which the Flyers emerged victorious 
] during the 1997-1998 season. Also, the 
]number of games won by the Flyers 
\ during their trip to the 1996 Stanley 
I Cup Finals.
would return home empty-handed.
The numbers begin to speak for them
selves, and yet the most important num
ber is yet to come: 8.5 million. As you can 
probably guess, that number does not 
represent the number of adoring fans 
who watch Hockey Night in Canada 
because Eric Lindros is dreamy; it is 
the Flyers captains salary (in U.S. dol
lars) for the upcoming year.
The man is simply not worth that 
much money to an organization that 
could have gaine d much more from trad
ing him than it will from re-signing 
him. Yes, the man has talent  it is 
impossible to argue with the offensive 
numbers that he posts each year. In
deed, Lindros does possess great agility 
for his size. However, his leadership 
ability and sheer will to play the game 
of hockey cannot be ranked atop the list 
of NHL players. Teams he has been
who already has 
shown the ability to 
lead his team into 
the postseason and 
accept the responsibilities of the 
captains C.
One of hockeys 
true great players of 
our time can be had 
for fully one-fourth 
of that number. 
Steve Yzerman, win
ner of the Conn 
Smythe trophy as 
playoff MVP as a member of the 1997 
champion Detroit Red Wings, plays the 
game with passion and honor on both 
the offensive and defensive sides of the 
red line.
One other concept from Econ 101 
starts to become relevant: sunk costs. 
The Flyers have invested much into 
Lindros, both in acquiring him and 
maintaining his extremely hefty sal
ary. However, the organization must 
take a long hard look at what it is 
actually costing by re-signing its cap
tain. They need to move past the 
Lindros Era and accept the losses it 
has incurred already and ask:
How can we afford not to trade 
Eric Lindros?
Brian Smith is a junior mechanical 
engineering major. He owes crazy thanks

Right now were not 
competing at the top of the 
UAA, said Kendra But 
every year we play them, 
and every year we get a 
chance to beat them and 
show weve improved.
Improvement, especially 
in scoring, will need to be a 
priority for the Tartans 
this year.

started to move in the right 
direction. It takes a good 
three to five years to get 
more consistency and start 
to upset the top teams, 
hopefully on a regular ba

Our new coach is a good 
fit for the type of team that 
we have, said senior cap

in tune with us; she knows 
how we want to be treated.

Football coaches 
rank Tartans first
By RICH TORIO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Expectations are high for this 
years Tartan football team, but 
they seem relaxed. During an in
terview with head coach Rich 
Lackner, he said of the team, 
Were pleased with the depth 
and the material we have  
Then, someone banged on 
Lackners door, interrupting him. 
He shrugged it off. Thats one of 
the kids jaggin me, or one of my 
coaches jaggin me.
It is nice to see the Tartans 
relaxed after last years crazy 8- 
2, University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) championship season. 
The UAA coaches seem to think 
the Tartans can repeat; Carnegie 
Mellon was ranked first in their 
preseason poll.
Junior Russ Clay returns at 
quarterback to lead this years 
title run. Last year, Clay had a 
solid first year as starting quar
terback, throwing only one inter
ception in 140 attempts, and he 
will only get better. Hes a year 
more mature.... I think hes got
ten stronger, said Lackner. I 
think that going to battle for 10 
games and coming out with an 8- 
2 record did a lot for his confi
dence. We expect more out of Russ 
this year. Im sure Russ expects 
more out of himself.
Standing a few yards behind 
Clay will be the two-time, AllUAA fullback, junior Mike 
Campie. Campie is the offenses 
workhorse and playmaker. 
Campie [is] ... an excellent, ex
cellent football player, said 
Lackner. Theres nothing that 
we as a staff like better than to 
give the ball to him. [He] has a 
way of making things happen 
when the ball is in his hands.
Junior Mike Monsilovich and 
senior Bryan Kreuger are also 
threats to run the football.
Second-team All-UAA tight 
end, four-year veteran senior 
Chris Barnicle is the only return
ing starting receiver. A strong 
blocker with soft hands, he will 
anchor the receiver corps and aid 
the lineman. The split end posi
tion is up for grabs. Theres com
petition at that spot, said

Cross Country team defends title
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Can the womens cross country team achieve na
tional rankings again this year? Will the men be able 
to capitalize on experience and finish strong in the 
UAA? These are some of the pressing questions to be 
answered in the upcoming cross country season.
The women will set out to defend one of the most 
successful seasons of any CMU varsity athletic team. 
Beating last years 16th place national ranking will 
undoubtedly be a tough task.
Despite losing one runner from last year to graduation, the 1998 
team roster still 
reads like an index
of athletic and academic awards, includ
ing Cross County All-American and AllConference to name a few. The team will 
be looking to veteran All-Conference run
ners like seniors Maureen McGranahan 
and Margaret Powersas well as junior 
Melissa Sloan and others for leadership.
Our main goal this season will be to 
defend the Conference Championship, 
said womens team coach Dario 
Donatelli. I think we have the potential 
to be nationally ranked again as well.
As for obstacles to success, Donatelli 
perceives Washington University, Emory 
and the College of New Jersey in the 
region as the teams major competition.
ior Todd Shamitko should 
start. Some underclassmen 
might have to fill in until the 
line is healthy. Lackner is op
timistic. They seem to be hun
gry, he said.

program will go though major changes; Tartans will 
try to run away with the UAA title again; Mens 
soccer hopes to pull ahead of the pack; Womens 
Cross Country will defend its national ranking.
This years cross country team will 
feature five new runners, including four 
first-year students. My ultimate goal is 
that [the younger runners] learn from 
the upperclassmen to work together for 
the teams goals, said Donatelli.
As for the present, however, Donatelli 
is still very enthusiastic. You need 
seven good runners to make up a win
ning team. We.have 10 people you could 
call competitive.
The team has started regular prac
tices in preparation for their first meet 
at home September 5. Many members 
got a jump start to the season over the 
summer and returned to school already 
in shape. They have all done their home
work, said Donatelli. The seasons look
ing good.
Mens coach Gary Meckley is also en
thusiastic, Wed like to finish in the top 
third in the UAA and make it to nation
als, he said.
The team still possesses a solid core of 
athletes, including senior Kris 
Kriechbaum and juniors Bryan Meyer 
and Kenn Oldham. All three won AllEast honors last year, and Kreichbaum 
was also named All-American.
In addition, newcomers strengthen 
the teams long-term 
hopes and goals. We have 
two freshmen on the team 
now that show promise, 
said Meckley. Im just 
looking for them to step 
up and make the commit
ment that is necessary for 
our level of competition. 
This may be critical for 
future success, for the 
team will be loosing two 
or three upperclassmen to 
graduation after the end 
of the season.
Overall, Meckleys hopes 
are high for the season. 
Given the current state of 
the veteran team and con
ference realignment on the 
horizon, he believes that 
this season will be pivotal 
to the long term success of 
the program. [This sea
son] is probably our best 
chance to make it to Na
tionals for a while.Mens soccer builds on experience

Every year the mens soccer team has to deal with a set of 
unknowns when preparing for the upcoming season. From the 
strength of the UAA teams they will play this year to who will be 
the first or second sub off the bench, there is a mystery to the 
beginning of the season. Experience has taught coach Nick 
Gaudioso to be cautious.
I dont do predictions, said Gaudioso.
The UAA is too tough a conference to start making predictions 
until the team gets a few games under its belt.
Last year the team started seven sophomores. It was led by 
senior Jason Beulow, who along with then-sophomore Harry 
Ulrich, captured first team All-UAA player honors as forwards.
This year Beulow is gone, but the seven sophomores remain as juniors 
this year, and will try to improve on their ranking in the hope of a 
postseason. Last year the team ranked ninth in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
Other teams in the association did better, though. Washington Univer
sity finished in the top 25, and Emory received votes as a top 25 team.
For now the biggest concern is getting the team into game shape. Most 
players dont get the chance to train seriously over the summer. Getting 
into game shape requires time that the two-week preseason doesnt 
allow for.
Theyre stiff right now. They need their legs back, said Gaudioso. Right 
now their timing with the ball isnt where it was at the end of last season.
Last Friday they played their second scrimmage of the season, but despite 
a 1-0 win they couldnt shake all of their rust off. This year part of that process 
will involve making junior Doug Jones the new forward to play with Ulrich.

Stepping stones to careers
Writer shares story of job search
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
When you first arrive at CMU, you 
embark upon a road with many 
twists and turns. It is virtually im
possible to know where you will end 
up four years later because, as I 
have learned over the past few years, 
life is filled with the unexpected.
At the beginning of last year, I 
began my search for a summer in
ternship in a marketing-related 
field. .(I am a business adminis
tration major with a marketing 
track.) I wanted to spend my 
last summer before graduation 
doing something that would 
prepare me for the real 
world. I wasnt sure what 
type of career I wanted to 
pursue because I was in
terested in a variety of
areas from graphic communi
cations management to adver
tising to management consult
ing to public relations. One of 
my primary interests was to 
spend the summer in the Big 
Apple. I had spent all of my 
previous summer vacations at 
home, and I was aching to be in 
New York.
The process of finding a job 
that met my career and location 
requirements was not so easy. 
You would think that New York, 
being the huge city that it is, 
would have something for me to 
do. I tried going to the Career 
Center and to the Business Op
portunities Conference (BOC) 
and searched extensively on my 
own. After spending months call
ing various types of companies 
and sending out resumes, I
learned that I would have to con
sider other locations as well.
I thought I could find another 
hip, happenin place to live for the 
summer; after all, other places 
have art, culture, and excitement,
a public relations firm in Wash
ington, DC, an advertising agency 
in Virginia, and 'a consulting com
pany in Maryland. After all my 
searching, I didnt find anything 
in New York. Last September, I

too. As it turns put, hip, happenin 
towns and career-oriented jobs 
dont always coincide. I ended up 
traveling to different areas for in

was determined to be in New York, 
but a couple months later, I had to 
let that idea go.

Career Center offers resources 
for summer internship seekers
By GREGORY NOFI
Tartan Staffwriter
If you cant see yourself as a profes
sional hamburger flipp er, youre prob
ably already considering an intern
ship for the summer of 99. Last 
summer, many CMU students 
used the time to make some 
money and gain some experi
ence for future careers. Fortu
nately, the Career Center pro
vides many opportunities to 
obtain a desirable internship 
for next summer. At their 
office in the basement of 
Warner Hall, students
can find a team of counselors and a collec
tion of resources to help with their job 
search. This resource is not just available 
for seniors and graduate students. Un
dergraduate students can also take ad
vantage of the center to help with their 
internship searches and career paths.
One undergraduate who used the Ca
reer Center to aid with his internship 
search is Barrett Trask, a senior com
puter science major. Trask recently fin
ished working at an internship with the 
Altera Corporation in San Jose, Calif., 
where he worked on a team of software 
developers. He discovered this job op
portunity through the Career Center 
last year.
The Career Center basically orga
nizes all the companies coming in and 
lets us know about it, said Trask. Its 
up to us to do the rest of the steps to 
pursue the job with their advice if we 
need it.
Trask had searched the postings on 
the Career Center bboards. While the 
center no longer announces job 
opportunities this way, students can 
still use the resource center available 
at the office.
In our resource center, we have a 
specific internship section, said Eileen

CMU begins planning for Y2K compliance
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
[Editor's note: This article is the first of 
two parts examining the Year2000prob
lem and its impact on CMU. Next weeks 
edition will look in depth at what is being 
done at CMU to prepare for the turn of 
the millennium.]
This past summer, governments and 
corporations the world over breathed a 
sigh of relief as Wall Street ran a suc
cessful simulation of stock trades and 
bank transactions. The computer con
sultants and systems analysts running 
the simulation werent just toying with 
a new software package, however  
they were testing the newly-configured 
Year 2000-compliant programs that will 
be running the worlds economy as cal
endars change from December 31,1999 
to January 1, 2000.
Wall Street, however, isnt the only 
place where programmers are crossing 
their fingers as simulations and test 
systems start up with their clocks set 
forward to sometime in the year 2000. 
CMU, like other organizations world
wide, has recently begun to comb 
through its computer systems in an 
effort to eliminate any problems that 
2000 might bring.
Year 2000  or Y2K  compliance is 
currently one of the most widely dis
cussed topics in modern computing. 
Many computer systems and businesses 
across the country rely on programs 
that were written 15 or more years ago. 
Then, storage space for data was ex
pensive, and programmers formatted 
dates using a six-digit system. For ex
ample, August 31,1998 might be repre
sented as 083198.
However, original programmers didnt 
expect their programs to still be in use in 
2000 and did not foresee the problems 
caused by the six-digit system: when the 
last two digits of the year change from 99 
to 00, many systems will interpret the 
new date as 1900, not 2000. In addi
tion to causing problems with things 
like bill payments, computer systems 
that depend on the date for their basic 
functions will likely not run.
CMUs administration began to focus 
on the problem last January, when it 
established a Y2K Implementation
Planning Team. The team was charged 
with creating a plan that the Univer
sity could follow to become Y2K compli
ant. The first steps have been to assess 
the extent of the problem at CMU and 
to determine the budget requirements 
to make the campus keep on ticking in 
2000. The team also created a Web site, 
at http://www.as.cmu.edu/year2000/ 
year2000.html, to keep the campus up
dated on CMUs Y2K compliance.
What we did over the summer was a 
full analysis of how we might be af
fected, said Andy Chang, an analyst in 
the Office of the Vice President for Uni
versity Planning and a departmental 
liaison for the Y2K effort. About a month 
ago, the committee made a report to the 
vice president.... We estimate that 
Carnegie Mellon is well-prepared. Weve 
been in touch with our software and 
hardware vendors, and theyre mostly 
Y2K compliant.
The team then divided CMUs com
puter systems into several different 
categories, based on their importance to 
the Universitys function and 
operation. For example, Category A sys
tems are those required for safety code
compliance  such as the central fire 
alarm monitoring system. This 
system, which was not Y2K compliant, 
is being replaced at a cost of $90,000. 
Many other programs that are used by 
departments to keep track of budgets 
and records  such as FileMaker Pro 
and Microsoft Excel  have either been 
tested to be Y2K compliant or will be 
replaced with updated, compliant pro
grams before 2000.
The backbone of the Universitys com
puting power, the Andrew File System 
(AFS), is not under any serious threat 
from Y2K problems. AFS is based on the 
Unix operating system, which uses a 
date system that counts dates from a 
starting year of 1970. Unix counts the 
elapsed time since 1970 and displays the 
date accordingly; although date displays 
may not be correct, the team does not 
anticipate any system crashes as the 
result of the change in years.
We dont know how every single 
system in the University will handle the 
year 2000, said Chang. But 
were pretty confident that CMU is 
compliant and that there wont be any 
major problems.

Others attend the fair to discover what 
is out there for students to get involved
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Features Editor
Admissions office pamphlets, high 
school guidance counselors, academic 
advisors, and campus tour guides have 
all told you that in order to get the most 
out of college, you need to get involved. 
This Thursday will be your first major 
opportunity to do so.
The Fall Activities Fair will take place 
on Thursday from 4:30-6:30 pm outside 
the University Center (weather permit
ting). At press time, 47 student organi
zations had signed up; Anne Witchner, 
assistant dean of Student Affairs and 
director of Student Activities, expects 
this number to grow to about 120 by the 
time the fair is held. These organiza
tions include religious groups, special 
interest clubs, governing bodies, and 
political organizations.
The Activities Fair is a great oppor
tunity for new students to learn what 
our students do on campus, said 
Witchner. Its a place to get a sense of 
all the interesting things students do 
on campus.
Representatives from each of the par
ticipating student organizations will 
occupy a series of tables in the Merson 
Courtyard and along the loggia on the 
west side of the University Center. The 
Office of Student Activtities will also 
have a table to help students find what 
they are looking for and to act as a 
starting point for attendees.
In addition, seven student organiza
tions will have the chance to demon
strate their activities to 
students during the fair in 
a stage area set up in the 
Merson Courtyard. The 
idea of having such a show
case began last fall. Ac
cording to Denise Fazio, 
coordinator of Student Ac
tivities, the showcase went 
over well with students last 
year, and so the decision 
was made to continue the 
tradition this year.
The organizations that 
will present themselves in 
the showcase this year in
clude the Fencing Club;
Friends of the Board, a club 
dedicated to skateboarding 
and advocacy of skaters 
rights on campus; the So
ciety for Creative Anach
ronism, an educational or
ganization dedicated to the ^ student talks to re-creation of the arts, sci
ences, and atmospheres of the Middle 
Ages; and the Dancers Symposium, 
which puts on choreographed perfor
mances designed and run by students 
throughout the school year.
[The showcase] was great, said 
Michelle Kim, a sophomore information 
and decision systems major who attended 
the fair last year. It definitely attracted 
more people than just putting signs up.
Some students walk into the fair know
ing what they are looking for and come 
just to make contact. I thought it was

in. It was good in the sense that you get 
to know what organizations there are as

sophomore computer science major. In 
one shot, you get to know the organiza
tions on campus.
Witchner advises students who want 
to attend the fair to keep an open mind 
and visit all the tables. Students may 
find exactly what they want; they may 
find people doing something theyve never 
done before, she said. Collect informa
tion, but dont feel you have to sign up

so I took the job.
It meant moving almost two hours 
away from home to a town where I didnt 
know anyone. I moved into an off-cam
pus townhouse with some students from 
the local college. The people in this town 
were sweet and simple. The area was a 
scenic water town, with large open fields
and a pretty blue river. Boating, fishing, 
and going to the local bar (the only one in 
town) were the main sources of enter
tainment. All of this sounds nice enough. 
What could be better than down-to-earth, 
friendly people, and a scenic river view? 
Considering that I wanted to spend my 
summer with abrasive New Yorkers, 
exploring an urban scene and reveling 
in pop culture, my new home was a little 
dry. Alas, you cant have everything. I 
talked myself into into moving to south
ern Maryland because the job promised 
to be a great experience, not because the 
town was so exciting.
The internship was everything I could 
have hoped it would be. I was given 
exciting projects, I met with clients, 
and I got a good look at what manage
ment consulting was all about. The ex
perience helped me decide that consult
ing is the best career option for me after 
graduation and that living in small town 
is not for me.
Now, as I begin my search for a real 
job, I know much more about my goals 
and preferences than I did a few months 
ago. My internship was an incredible 
learning opportunity, one that will help 
me greatly this year. I know that I cant 
hold my breath waiting for the perfect 
job in New York, but I also know that I 
cant move to a small town permanently, 
regardless of the opportunities that may 
await me. I have a few ideas about where 
I want to be in a year from now, but I 
know better than to have my heart set 
on anything too specific.
Like most things in life, searching for 
a job is an exciting process, because you 
never know where it will take you. I do 
not believe in wrong turns, because in 
the road of life, every comer promises 
something new and exciting. Wherever I 
end up next June, I am confi
dent that I will have an
other opportunity 
to learn and grow.
CENTER, from page LI
sists of books weve purchased that 
list available internships.
The biggest addition to the Career 
Centers offerings this year is the new 
TartanTRAK online system which can 
be accessed through the Career Centers 
Web page. The new system makes it 
easier for undergraduates to get the 
latest information about announce
ments and news from the center.
[With TartanTRAK], I think its 
going to be a lot easier for people to 
find internships this year, said Trask.
Among the many features of 
TartanTRAK for students is the op
portunity to participate in on-campus 
recruiting and resume drops. In the 
on-campus recruiting process, compa
nies will come to campus to conduct 
interviews with interested students.
Students can also submit resumes 
electronically to resume drops for com
panies to search for qualified appli
cants. The companies then call stu
dents if theyre interested in conduct
ing an interview. These services are 
not available to everyone, however.
[Undergraduates] who are inter
ested in using the TartanTRAK for 
campus interviews and resume 
drops must attend an orientation 
meetingin order to participate, 
said Buecher. Information 
about the orientation sessions 
is available from the Career 
Center.
Students can also set up 
appointments with a ca
reer counselor to get help 
in the internship search.
There are six career 
counselors, one 
for each college 
within CMU.
Counselors can help with other tasks 
that may prove beneficial when apply
ing for an internship. Students can 
participate in the Mock Interview Pro
gram to practice interviewing skills in 
a simulated setting. Students also fre
quently use counselors to help with 
writing resumes.
Regardless of the path taken to an 
internship, it is important for interested 
students to conduct their search before 
it is too late.
Start early in making and honing 
your resume, said Trask. I screwed up 
my first interview because I jumped 
right into it without preparing. Mock 
interviews are a big help.
Career counselors are available from 
the beginning of the school year to help 
students who want to start early.
Most of the internship interviews 
come in the spring, but some companies 
start in the fall, said Buecher. Never
theless, a lot of companies will still take 
resumes in the fall.
The Career Center is located in the 
basement of Warner Hall in Room 19.

Undergraduate 
Mock Trial Team
Then consider joining Carnegie Mellons Undergraduate Mode Trial Team.
The Undergraduate Mock Trial Team is open to all CMU undergraduates (not 
just members of the CMU Student Prelaw Society). CMU will host an invitational 
intercollegiate mock trial tournament on November 14,1998. If interested, contact 
Dr. Joseph Devine at idOx@andrew.cmu.edu.
NOTE: Prospective mock trial participants might want to consider the following 
Fall 1998 course: 66-182, Topics in Law, 6 units, Pass/Fail, WF, 3:30-4:20 pm, 
Student Center 200. This course is essentially a professional writing/public 
speaking/oral argument course, couched in a legal/courtroom context. Its 
theoretical focus is on the structure and rules of U.S. court procedure, with a 
heavy applied emphasis on trial procedure (e.g., the functions, rules, and techniques 
of oral arguments in American courtrooms [e.g., opening and closing statements], 
the functions, rules, and techniques of witness examinations [direct and crossexaminations]), how and why these rules vary with different case types (e.g., 
criminal vs. civil trials), etc. The course has no prerequisites, and is open to any 
undergraduate.
There will be a non-binding relationship between this course and the CMU 
November 1998 intercollegiate mock trial tournament. For example, a hypothetical 
civil case will be a primary focus of the course, and will also be the case argued 
at this November tournament. However, enrollment in the course will not require 
participation in the mock trial tournament; conversely, participation in the 
tournament will not require enrollment in the course.
Register for this course online.
Fall Job Openings at theHelp Center
The Computing Services Help Center is 
now hiring for part-time fall openings for 
student consultants.
Student consultants who staff the center provide the campus community 
with telephone, walk-in, and electronic mail services to answer questions 
related to computing at the university.

LiPall Films
Movies. We all watch, them, from the newest eye candy to the old standbys and the experimental shorts. Weve picked out some of the trends for this season.
Seasons quality movies arrive
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Staffwriter
The time for asteriods has come 
and.gone. Giant lizards? Happily 
extinct. The horses have all 
stopped whispering, and six days 
and seven nights have long since 
passed. In other words, summer 
is over. Quick, while no ones look
ing, break out the quality films.
Its no surprise that fall is the 
tim when the words Oscar con
tender are on everyones lips. In 
this brief respite between hrainless summer movies and brain
less holiday fare, Hollywood brings 
out its movies with, well, a brain.
First examined in Return to 
Paradise, in which a New York 
limo driver (Vince Vaughn) must 
contemplate going to prison for 
three years to save his friend
(Joaquin Phoenix) from death, 
difficult friendships are one of 
the biggest themes this fall. This 
theme appears again in Round
ers, Matt Damons first movie 
since he stormed the entertain
ment world last year in Good 
Will Hunting. In Rounders, re
leased September 11, Damon 
plays another genius, but this 
time instead of solving math 
equations he tries to solve his 
best friends (Ed Nortons) finanan overnight sensation. John 
Waters wrote and directed this 
satire of the New York art 
scene which will be released 
September 25. Slam, directed 
by Marc Levin, is another small 
budget movie about an un
likely artist. Already a film 
festival favorite, Slam stars 
newcomer Saul Williams as a 
convicted drug addict who ex
presses himself through po
etry. Self-expression is also a
cial troubles with one game of concern in Little Voice. Mark
big-stakes poker. Norton is also 
in American History X, directed 
by Tony Kaye, where he plays an 
ex-skinhead who goes to great 
lengths to convince his brother 
(Edward Furlong) not to follow 
in his footsteps.
Furlong also stars in Pecker, 
as a photographer who becomes
John Carpenter's Vampires is one of
Herman directed this film 
about a young girl who is so 
shy she can only communicate 
by singing, which she does in 
dead-on impersonations of 
Judy Garland and Billie 
Holliday.
Little Voice stands out in the 
ever-growing slew of movies 
categorized as dark com
edies. Another standout is 
Very Bad Things, with 
Christian Slater and 
Cameron Diaz, a film 
which combines two movie 
staples: weddings and 
murder. Other notables in
clude Permanent Mid
night, with Ben Stiller 
starring in this loose ad
aptation of Jerry Stahls 
autobiography. Clay Pi
geons also taps into dark 
humor, again teaming 
1998 Columbia Joaquin Phoenix with 
this seasons many supernatural films. Please see PREVIEW, page L9
Theaters expand city art scene
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
From documentaries to mu
sicals to Ingrid Bergmans lost 
classic, Pittsburghs indepen
dent theaters show films that 
you may not be able to see 
anywhere else. All around the 
city, these movie theaters add 
life and artistry to the Pitts
burgh film scene. But be fore
warned  if youre looking for 
high-class computer graphics 
and 20-million-dollar names, 
these arent the right places.
If youre looking for freshness 
and style that deviate from 
the mainstream, youve found 
your niche.
Andrew Sproule is the di

Oakland, where many Carnegie

Filmmakers owns and operates 
three of the citys most active 
independent movie theaters: the 
Melwood Screening Room, the

Industrys soundtrack trend continues as albums gross millions
I
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Well, the verdict is in from the record 
industry, and it seems that album sales 
have jumped nine percent so far in 1998. 
Sounds like quite an increase, until one 
considers that movie soundtracks have 
increased a whopping 31 percent so far. 
While film-goers mostly shunned bigbudget flicks like Godzilla and Arma
geddon, music buyers made up for it by
buying soundtracks _____________
from those 'movies in 
record numbers. And of 
course, theres always 
that soundtrack about 
some movie involving a 
large sinking boat (you 
may have heard of it, 
unless youve been a hermit for the last 
year or so) that has moved a stunning 10 
million copies.
Yes, soundtracks have certainly 
evolved from the days when a popular 
album only came along every once in a 
while, like Saturday Night Fever or 
Purple Rain. Now, seemingly any movie 
that makes its way to the theaters comes
Certainly, Titanics remarkable box of
fice success led to many of the albums 
sales  traditional Celtic melodies dont 
usually sell one-thousandth of that fig
ure. Less clear, however, is whether, 
say, the Nicolas Cage /Meg Ryan City of 
Angels or the Goo Goo Dolls/Alanis 
Morrisette City of Angels profited more 
from the arrangement. In any case, the 
artists arent complaining  they get 
plenty of exposure as well as often lucra
tive rewards. For instance, Beck was

reportedly paid $750,000 for his contri
bution to A Life Less Ordinary.
So why is it that fans are flocking to 
these collections of movie-related mu
sic? Well, a quick look around the musi
cal landscape provides an easy explana
tion. With the rise of hip-hop, a mostly 
singles-oriented genre, and the decline
of rock, which is traditionally artist and 
along with a dozen or so pop songs realbum driven, fans have fewer and fewer 
lated to the film. Often, its difficult bands to latch on to. Soundtracks prowhether to tell if the film or the album vide a good way for fans to survey whats 
benefits more from the arrangement, available and see what they like.
Gone also, it seems, are films where 
the songs from the soundtrack actually 
appear in the movie, exemplified by 
1994s The Crow, where every single 
song can be heard during the film. These 
days, soundtracks are usually inspired 
by the picture. The X-Files movie, for 
instance, featured a mere two songs from 
its tie-in CD. Hip-hop scores often follow 
this same pattern. The films Bulworth 
and Dr. Dolittle both appear to have 
little in common with their soundtrack 
____________ counterparts, yet both al
bums charted reasonably 
well. Be on the lookout 
for another hip-hop 
soundtrack from the film 
How Stella Got Her 
___Groove Back, which fea
tures Wyclef Jean and 
MeShell Ndegeocello.
With fall coming around shortly, Hol
lywood studios will probably look away 
from popcorn fare and turn moie to
wards Oscar material. Consequently, 
big blockbuster soundtracks will more 
than likely lay low for a few months 
anyway and let the films work for them
selves. Next summer, however, the grabbag CDs should be out again in full force. 
One prediction, though  the Star Wars 
prequel will do just fine, soundtrack 
or not.This summers Armageddon boasted an accompanying album featuring Aerosmith.

L8 The Tartan  Carnegie Mellon University  31 August 1998Pearl Jam proves their worth to audiences again
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
After giving up on their struggle 
against Ticketmaster, Pearl Jam decided 
to hit the road and have some fun. Last 
Tuesday, playing their first concert in 
the Pittsburgh area in five years, the 
group put on a stellar show that in
cluded just about any song you could ask 
to hear and delighted the thousands of 
fans who braved the muddy conditions 
at Star Lake Amphitheater.
Like any band promoting a recent 
album, Pearl Jam made certain to high
light songs from their latest release,
Yield. Unlike many bands who stub
bornly refuse to play the songs that won 
fan adoration in the first place, the 
band performed popular fare 
from each of their albums, in
cluding nearly everything 
from their every-growing dis
cography. Intermixed with old 
favorites like Alive and 
Evenflow were new songs, 
like Brain of J and No Way.
Pearl Jam even snuck in a few songs 
not found on their five studio albums, 
like Yellow Ledbetter and the Neil 
Young classic Rockin in the Free 
World.
As always with Pearl Jam, Eddie 
Vedder proved to be the main attraction. 
Fans began chanting Eddie, Eddie right
The entire concert made the 
band sound every bit as eloquent 
and powerful as ever. 
after Iggy Pops opening act concluded 
and roared their approval as he took the 
stage. Vedder kept his trademark on
stage rambling to a minimum, and 
turned in a remarkably clear and strong
vocal performance. The rest of the group 
adhered mostly to the studio version of 
each song, although they tweaked a few 
tunes, like Daughter, and 
gave an amazing perfor
mance of Black. The rest 
of the band seemed quite at 
ease on stage, even with 
ex-Soundgarden member 
Matt Cameron manning 
the drums.
The fans, for their part, responded 
best to familiar songs from Ten and 
Versus. Tracks from Yield seemed alien 
to much of the crowd, with the possible 
exception of Given to Fly. The only
selection from No Code, the smartly 
chosen Hail, Hail, also elicited little | 
response. Still, there was nary a dull | 
moment at the show  not a single song 
seemed out of place or poorly chosen. If1 
there is a doubt in anyones mind as to 
the lasting popularity of Pearl Jam, it 
had to have been erased during Jer
emy. As Vedder and the band played a 
focused, urgent version of perhaps their I 
biggest hit, most everyone sang along, 
as if it were required. And, as a testa
ment to Pearl Jams skill, the song, and 
the entire concert, made the band sound 
every bit as eloquent and powerful 
as ever.Photographer Witnesses 
tattoos in recent exhibit
By BECCA FREBUSH
Tartan Forum Editor
Photographer Mark Perrott has 
a thing for tattoos.
One day in 1979, he happened 
to drive past a tattoo parlor in 
McKees Rocks and became capti
vated by the intricate designs he 
saw through the windows. That 
incident inspired him to start 
snapping pictures of people and 
their tattoos.
The harvest of Perrotts nearly 
20 years of fascination with this 
artform are on display in his ex
hibit Tattoo Witness, at Pitts
burgh Filmmakers Melwood Pho
tography Gallery, until Septem
ber 30. Featuring a selection of 
13 portraits of people hes met at 
tattoo parlors and conventions 
over the years, this show makes 
clear what so enchanted Perrott 
about people who wear artwork 
directly on their bodies, and 
serves up some memorable pho
tographs in the process.
Every person creates their own 
outside skin in their own way 
with tattoos. Thats what makes 
it right for the camera, says 
Perrott about what moved him to 
start capturing them and their 
wearers on camera. Like clothing 
but more intimate, the tattoos 
demonstrate the individuality of 
their wearers and how they seek 
to present themselves to the 
world. Perrotts work expertly 
demonstrates that tattoos are, 
among other things, a potent 
means of self-expression. Yet tat
toos are, unlike clothing and cos
metics, permanent. In getting a 
tattoo, youre choosing images 
that mean so much to you that 
youre willing to make them part 
of your body for the rest of your 
natural life. This fact, that tat
toos not just adorn but literally 
transform the body, gives these 
pictures dramatic impact.
The subject of one of his por
traits, Lee, 1994, takes the con
nection between tattos and cloth
ing as far as it can go. He has so 
many so close together on his 
chest that they look like a shirt. 
He even has a tattoo to simulate 
a string laced through the shirt
whose tattoos poke out from un
der the sleeves of his t-shirt.
Looking at these portraits, it| 
soon becomes clear that theyre H 
actually collaborative works. They j J 
owe their power and inventive-; 1 
ness to the fact that so many; j 
peoples artistic visions have gone 'j

and closing it at the neck.
The other subjects wear their 
tattoos just as distinctively. 
Teresa resembles a Goth-club 
version of the singer Jewel, with 
blonde hair, a dark bra, a choker, 
and a tattoo on her upper arm of 
a heart on fire. Then theres 
Frank, 1980, a gentle-looking 
white-haired man who stares 
straight at the camera. On his 
uncovered chest is an expertly 
rendered design featuring a big 
peacock thronged with assorted 
horses and butterflies.
The freshest pictures are those 
of people whose tattoos are some
how unexpected, like Frank, or 
Ray, 1981, whose gaunt, tired 
face, long hair, and beard make 
him look more like an overworked 
student than anything else, and
into each one  the tattoo artist, ; 
the individual wealing the draw, 
ing, and Perrott himself. They 1 
force the viewer to look at tattoos j; 
not just as a rebellious and color
ful means of self-expression, but, : 
as a bona fide art form. You find ; 
yourselfmesmerizedby the grace-1 
ful lines and creativity of the tat-j' 
toos, whether it be Franks horses j; 
and butterflies or the complex i 
jungle design running down the 
arms and legs of1Lolita, 1995. Of n 
course, there are also the 'atti1 
tudes and personalities of the sub: 
jects, which the photographs |;j 
record vividly. Perrotts tattoo phor; 
tographs allow viewers to appre. 
date not just his own talent and ; 
creativity, but those of the artists g 
who created the tattoos and the | 
people who proudly wear them.; I

Men With Guns
Yep, theres men in this movie. They have guns. 
Theres also a Spanish doctor. He roams the lovely 
rural Spanish countryside. He treats patients, 
ailing elderly people. Pretty spooky.
Id suggest watching this movie if youre a fan of 
John Sayles, an independent filmmaker. Hes one 
of those rare chaps who can get big studios to let 
him do whatever he wants. If youre also a fan of 
Irish movies, try Sayles The Secret of Roan Inish, 
an ethereal fairy tale. No guns, here.

JUDE
No One Is Really Beautiful  Maverick 
???
The folk sounds of JUDE sort of grow on you 
... slowly ... like fungus. The track sequence 
of his album, No One is Really Beautiful, was 
poorly arranged. The first track, You Mama 
You, gets the album off to a bad start with a 
fast-paced jumble of high-wired rhyming lyr
ics. Its certainly not a song to sing along to.
When you get past that initial musical blun
der, however, the album gets a little better. 
JUDE has a soft, soothing voice that lends 
nicely to his folk style and jazzy guitar. On a 
low note, some of the song lyrics are surpris
ingly crude and egotistical. The songs revolve 
around self-praise or lost loves. The songs 
could have been interesting if the lyrics didnt 
rhyme like bad poems.
While the album improves as the tracks 
progress, the overall feel is still the same. The
music isnt too terrible, the lyrics need some 
work, and JUDE has a pleasant vocal range 
and delivers every song with a smooth articu
late style. While he doesnt seem to be the 
superstar stud he claims to be in Charlie 
Says, JUDE has the potential to succeed as a 
folk artist.  ENA KHAN
TransGlobal Underground
Rejoice, Rejoice  MCA 
??
TransGlobal Underground are one of the 
leaders in the tribal-house sub-genre, one that 
combines hip-hop and electronic elements with 
global and world beats.
But that doesnt make their third LP, Re
joice, Rejoice, any good.
Im not too knowledgable of much world 
music, and the mainstream examples Ive been 
exposed to, for example Pittsbugh-native 
Rusted Root, have been unimpressive.
I must concede that TGU understand how to 
use percussion well, as they skillfully combine 
live and synthesized drums in all 13 of the 
albums tracks. The beat is what drives TGUs 
songs, and they almost save the album by 
keeping your foot tapping. But the beat isnt 
enough to make this CD worth the price 
of admission.
TGU have no qualms about using wildly 
different musical styles on the same track.
The opener, A Nice Little Fish Business 
and Making Money, uses a harmonica' 
alongside rap. Rude Buddah is what 
you get when you throw polka and techno 
in a blender.
Sadly, the mad musical concoctions; 
arent the only drawback.
For example, on City of Gold, youve; 
some guy growling the lyrics, El Dorado; 
and the fabled city of gold. Child of^ 
my mothers breast, suck no more, and; 
then enters what sounds like the choir; 
from The Color Purple. Is anyone else; 
confused? I am. I agree that the human; 
voice is as much an instrument as it is a; 
means to convey some laical content, but; 
the vocals on Rejoice, Rejoice serve instead1 
as a distraction. - RYAN D. SCHILLINGOpening features jazz musicians!

This year the Hewlett Gallery 
opened its fall season of exhibits 
with a bang. The opening recep
tion for Charles Caves Lush Life, 
an installation honoring the work 
of Pittsburgh jazz composer and 
musician Billy Stray horn, fea
tured a live jazz trio. Strayhom 
composed such famous pieces as 
Take the A Train and the title 
piece, Lush Life.
Mistakenly, Strayhorns works 
are frequently credited to the fa
mous Duke Ellington, though, in
Mariana Ferris, who made her 
way from the music mezzanine 
upstairs. I wish I could stay 
longer, she said.
Perhaps the most striking 
thing about the opening was the 
difference between what went 
on inside and outside of the gal
lery. The work looked more like 
a tribute to a rather 
unaccomplished carpenter than 
an exhibit designed to capture 
the life and vibrancy of the mu
sic Strayhorn created.
Charles Caves sculptural 
works were placed directly on 
the floor, bathed in melancholy

music community. Despite the 
fact that Strayhorn composed the 
music before many of the people 
in attendance at the opening were 
even born, the vibe was far from

Bandleader Joe Harris (far right) lead a jazz trio at the opening of Lush Life.
Though the art was somewhat 
anti-heroic, the music more tha^ 
made up for it. Outside of the gal-; 
lery, students, local musicians,; 
artists, and others talked excitj 
edly about jazz. Everyone wanted 
to know more about Strayhorn. 
Bandleader, percussionist, and 
recent Mellon Jazz Festival honoree Joe Harris took time out 
between each song to tell the au
dience more about jazz, compos
ing, and Strayhorn. Harris has 
played drums since 1943 in Euhero. We stand in awe of rope and America. He played with 
his ability to pull, seemElla Fitzgerald as well as Radio 
Free Berlin. Most recently, he 
has taught jazz history at the 
University of Pittsburgh. He 
[Billy Strayhorn] was very un
usual, in the sense that he was 
great, said Harris. You almost 
have to be a musician to under
stand the complexity of some 
things he does.
Hearing the pieces Strayhorn 
wrote, played masterfully by 
Howard Alexander, Dan Wasson, 
and Harris, made it clear who 
Billy Strayhorn was and why, 
after all these years, he still con

was this awe that Cave

this exhibit. He chose 
not to focus on rumors 
of Strayhorns alcohol

scale, a sense of small

Vince Vaughn. Phoenix is a man 
who unknowingly befriends a se
rial killer (Vaughn), who has been 
framing him. Also in this picture, 
which comes out October 2, is 
Janeane Garofalo as an FBI agent 
trying to sort the whole mess out.
While dark comedies find hu
mor in examining human foibles, 
a number of movies this fall look 
to the paranormal for inspira
tion. Most anticipated of these is 
John Carpenter's Vampires be
cause, lets face it, no one does the 
paranormal like John Carpen
ter. Along with its notable direc
tor, Vampires also sports an allstar cast including James Woods 
as a head vampire slayer. Other 
big celebrities lend their star
power to paranormal films. 
Theres Practical Magic with 
Sandra Bullock and Nicole 
Kidman as two witches trying 
to break a 100-year curse, and 
Brad Pitt starring as the hu
man incarnation of Death in 
Meet Joe Black.
Whether the movie is a film 
festival favorite or a big studio 
picture, fall screens are awash 
with movies that ask some 
pretty big questions. What 
would you do for someone you 
care about? Could a druggedout convict be the worlds next

pened to Christian Slater? And 
most importantly, would we 
fear death if we knew he looked 
like Brad Pitt?

The Beehive in Oakland shows 
lesser-known films, such as this

stream and independent films.
Besides offering no lack of vari
ety, these houses and the films 
they offer sit on the cutting edge 
of creativity, accordingto Sproule. 
Pittsburghs art-film houses pro
vide an outlet for that creativity.
Independent film... shares the 
artists pure vision and, hence, is 
more reliable as far as pure art 
goes, said Sproule. Therefore, 
without art-film houses, all people 
would have access to is the Holly
wood type film and that would be 
like people only having access to 
NBC, ABC, or CBS on television 
... they would never see the infi
nite possibilities of [film].

September 7Labor Day
As everybody knows, the first 
. Monday of every September is 
' designated as Labor Day. It is a 
'holiday that has been celebrat
ed for over 100 years, starting 
with union workers in New York 
City taking an unpaid day off in 
September 1882 to march 
around Union Square to protest 
the lack of a holiday.-President 
Grover Cleveland seized the 
chance of conciliation with the 
unions, and in 1894, an election 
year, Labor Day was born as a 
national holiday. Coincidentally, 
he was not re-elected.
While this holiday did not work 
, out for President Cleveland, it 
has turned out to be a joyous 
day for many other people 
across the nation. On this day, 
people of all sizes, shapes, and 
colors join together to celebrate 
the fact that there is no work or 
school for a day. And for that 
one day, alarm clocks are 
turned off nationwide, televi
sions are left on, and people 
actually take the time to smell 
the roses. But sometimes, peo
ple don't know what exactly to 
do with their free time. And that 
is a major problem because 
some people forget that there 
are some basic things to 
remember, the first being to 
bathe, especially if you happen 
to be a CS major. Besides that, 
the only other thing is to remem
ber not to show up for class.
