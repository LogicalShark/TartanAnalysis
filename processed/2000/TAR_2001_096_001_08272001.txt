The new Jewish University Center includes a study lounge, coffee bar, and computer cluster.Jewish University Center opens on Forbes
by Sara Henneberger
News Editor
This fall, the new Jewish 
University Center (JUC) will open 
its doors to Pittsburgh students and 
community members. As part of 
the International Hillel Foundation 
for Jewish life on campus, the JUC 
will serve CMU, the University of 
Pittsburgh, Duquesne, Chatham, 
and Robert Morris. The recently 
completed JUC is located on Forbes 
Avenue near the corner of Craig 
Street, next to the Uni-Mart.
Planning for the new JUC build
ing began about 2 years ago. 
Previously, the JUC had been locat
ed above Kiva Han and History on 
Craig Street and had limited space 
for programs. The demand for 
more room prompted students and 
community members to pursue the 
creation of a new center. Students 
from Pittsburgh universities were 
consulted in the design of the 
building, and their ideas led to the 
addition of a coffee lounge, activity 
lounge with a pool table and televi
sion, and a computer cluster to the
plans of the new JUC. Community 
organizations and individuals 
funded the design and building of 
the $2.5 million center.
The JUC plans to offer several 
activities each week in its new facil
ity. Currently, a theater group, yoga 
class, and music group are 
planned. Hillel will hold its usual 
events, including Friday night ser
vices, Rosh Hashannah and Yom 
Kippur services, and a Passover 
Seder at the new building. Hillel 
will also sponsor social events, 
community service opportunities, 
educational programs, and public 
speakers through the center.
The JUC will provide students 
with a space to socialize, study, and 
pursue Hillel-related activities, 
said Rachel Dub, a junior biology 
and psychology major and the stu
dent board President of Hillel at 
CMU.
Activity and interest in Hillel is 
growing with the addition of the 
building, which will allow a vast 
expansion in programming, said 
Aaron Weitman, a sophomore busi
ness major and member of Hillel.
Hillel members also hope that
the new building will allow for 
more centralized activities for stu
dents interested in JUC events. In 
the. past, weekly Shabbat services 
and dinners would be in random 
rooms either at the UC or in the 
William Pitt union, said Dub. 
Students frequently did not know 
when or where services were held. 
With a large, well equipped facility 
in a convinent location for many 
students, the new JUC will hope
fully attract more students.
I think the JUC will benefit 
CMU students greatly, because it 
not only gives them a place to relax 
during the day, but also a place to 
meet and interact with students 
from CMU and Pitt, said Alex 
Goldvug, a junior business and 
math major and member of Hillel.
The community grand opening 
for the JUC will be held on 
September 9, from 5 to 7 pm and 
the student grand opening will be 
held on September 16 from 12 to 1 
pm. However, the JUC will sponsor 
several events leading up to the 
grand openings, including a come
dy night, a bagel brunch, and a 
community service project.
gic priorities, said University 
President Jared Cohon. Cohon, 
who has a background in envi
ronmental studies and civil engi
neering, added that the 
University is committed to 
improving environmental quali
ty and providing a model for 
other universities and organiza
tions.
The wind-generated electrici
ty will come from 1.5 megawatt 
wind turbines at the ExelonCommunity Energy Wind Farm 
at Mill Run in Fayette County, 40 
miles southeast of Pittsburgh. 
The farm has 10 such turbines, 
making it the largest wind farm 
in the eastern U.S. CMU will pur
chase 4,778 megawatt-hours, 
which will require more than 
one of the turbines.
A University Challenge is 
being conceived to increase 
environmental awareness and 
practices on campus and encour
age students, faculty, and staff 
to conserve. The goal is to help 
offset the 48 percent premium 
CMU is paying for the wind 
power.
The challenge will decrease 
operation costs by encouraging 
recycling habits and using differ
ent lighting implementations in 
campus buildings. Innovative 
ideas for beneficial environmen
tal practices will be rewarded 
with gift certificates. A Web 
will track ideas, suggestions, 
and awards.
Rising energy costs and envi
ronmental concerns associated 
with coal-generated

environmental advantages over 
the use of fossil fuels. According

While Carnegie Mellon recently 
voted to provide health benefits 
to same-sex partners of employ
ees, the University of Pittsburgh 
is still struggling with the deci
sion. For over five years, Pitt has 
been fighting the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU), which is 
representing seven current and 
former employees to whom the 
university has refused the bene
fits.
Last May, Pitt announced that it 
would form a committee to inves
tigate the feasibility of providing 
health benefits to same-sex part
ners of employees. This decision 
temporarily suspended the class - 
action suit the ACLU filed against 
the university.
According to a recent Pitt News 
article, the ACLU wants this case 
to do more than seek damages for 
gay and lesbian Pitt employees, 
they want it to encourage policy 
change. Vic Walczak, the director 
of the Pittsburgh chapter of the 
ACLU, said he felt that the forma
tion of the committee was a step 
in the right direction and he was 
happy that they were considering 
the policy.
In early June, Pitt Chancellor 
Mark Nordenberg named 12 peo
ple to the committee. The com
mittee is made up of members of 
the Board of Trustees, the admin
istration, faculty, staff, alumni, 
and students. The committee is 
being headed by William 
Lieberman, the executive Vice 
President of the risk management 
firm Hilb, Rogal, & Hamilton 
Company.

Christiano died of liver cancer at 
his home at the age of 59.
CMU was a home to him. His 
heart was here, said Indira Nair, 
Vice Provost for education. He 
looked at many angles and 
always tried to make decisions 
that were best for CMU as an 
institution. She remembered

leges dean from 1989-1991. 
Appointed by President Robert 
Mehrabian, he served as Provost 
 the Universitys chief academ
ic officer  from 1991 until July 
of last year.
Christiano agreed to remain 
Provost for an additional three 
years when President Jared 
Cohon came to CMU in 1997. 
Paul has initiated and imple
mented changes that have 
strengthened the university and 
propelled it to new levels of 
achievement and recognition, 
said Cohon. He has always 
understood the character of 
Carnegie Mellon and his tenure 
has been marked by his ability to 
skillfully address the interests of 
the academic colleges and the 
administration.
Now an important part of the 
CMU curriculum, Christiano is 
credited for the success of interdis
ciplinary programs at the 
University. In 1997 Carnegie 
Mellon won a rare award from the 
National Science Foundation for 
its interdisciplinary focus. 
Christiano believed that learning 
could be accomplished through 
problem solving and that most real 
world problems stretched across 
disciplines. Further, he wanted to 
periodically pull graduate stu
dents from the depths of their con
centrations so that they could take 
a look around at what was hap
pening beyond their specialties.

Firestone reaches settlement with family
McALLEN, Texas (AP)  In 
many ways it makes sense that the 
first trial against
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. since 
last years recall played out in 
south Texas.
Heat is the enemy of tires, and all 
day long here, the asphalt absorbs 
the hot sun. The cities are spread 
out, making long road trips a part 
of life. There are off-road treks 
through sand and mesquite; in the 
west it turns to brush. Pieces of 
tread are common sights along the 
highways.
But the high-profile trial and its 
bigwig lawyers often stood out 
against the isolated and largely 
barren region where Marisa 
Rodriguez was left brain-damaged 
and paralyzed after a rollover in a 
Ford Explorer with Firestone tires. 
Her family reached a reported $7.5 
million settlement with 
Bridgestone/Firestone on Friday.
The Rodriguez familys lawyers, 
culled from three firms, flew in on 
private jets bought by settlements 
in other Firestone-Explorer cases. 
During deliberations, they ribbed 
one another about who had the 
faster plane. Little Rock attorney 
Tab Turner flew home to attend a 
PTA meeting and sleep in his own 
bed.
The defense attorneys came in 
knowing they had a tough job 
ahead. South Texas, a region iso
lated from the north by seemingly 
endless badlands of brush and cat
tle, is known for softhearted juries.
You recognize that plaintiffs 
like to try lawsuits in South Texas, 
lead defense attorney Knox 
Nunnally said before federal Judge 
Filemon Vela issued a gag order. 
Its just the history of what we 
have seen in jury verdicts.
Press and attorneys quickly 
learned to fear the orders of Vela, 
whose courtroom prohibitions 
included gum chewing, mint suck
ing, slouching, and having sun
glasses on ones head. More than 
one national news reporter was 
locked out of already-started pro
ceedings and pleas to bring cell 
phones were denied. Vela chewed 
out Turner for walking toward the 
back of the courtroom during testi
mony.
Then there was the family at the 
plaintiffs table: Dr. Joel
Rodriguez, a gentle-mannered 
Mexican-American doctor, his 
young children and his 39-year-old 
wife.
The family had already reached 
a settlement with Ford for $6 mil
lion, but Rodriguez wanted 
Bridgestone/Firestone to take 
responsibility for marketing tires 
that federal officials have linked to 
more than 200 deaths.
In Fridays settlement, the tire 
company did not admit liability, 
but Rodriguez said afterward that 
the case had accomplished some
thing.
The facts are out, he said. 
That was one of our main con
cerns.
The Rodriguez case was the first 
Firestone lawsuit to go to trial since 
the recall last summer of 6.5 mil
lion tires. On a family trip last year 
in an Explorer, the steel belt and 
tread on the right rear tire tore 
apart, and the vehicle overturned 
three times, crushing the roof.
Rodriguez testified that his 
once-vibrant wife now spends her 
days sitting at a table or watching 
television, a frightening sight to 
the youngest of their three chil
dren.
Rodriguez did not say why the 
family took the settlement, but 
observers said it likely was to avoid 
years of appeals.
If it was a substantial verdict 
against Firestone, it was likely it 
would be appealed and embroiled 
in the court system for years, said
Robert Ammons, a liability lawyer 
from Houston. A family has to live 
with the effects of such a tragedy 
and sometimes its better to resolve 
the matter and put it behind 
them.
Some legal experts said the set
tlement was a victory for Firestone, 
which may have succeeded in 
major damage control. Others said 
Firestone missed its opportunity to 
shift the blame to Ford.
Firestone, which has settled 
about 200 cases and has some 300 
pending, also had costs to consider. 
It has been bleeding money 
defending itself.
A $450-an-hour tire expert testi
fied midweek hed billed more 
than $10,000 for the case and the 
tab was still open. The company 
paid $10.5 million for a report to 
bolster an Explorer defect argu
ment. Firestone had internal as 
well as hired public relations peo
ple, as did Nunnallys firm and the 
three-firm plaintiffs team.
Analysts around the country 
commented to the media on 
Firestones risk. If the jury had 
decided to give the family all they 
asked for, Firestone could, on 
paper, suffer a loss of $1 billion of 
its professed $1.3 billion net worth.
As the jury continued to deliber
ate Friday, Turner approached 
Nunnally and said maybe its time 
we talked again. The two met in a 
witness room.
It was not known which way the 
jury was leaning. Its members were 
escorted from the courtroom and 
their names were sealed. The judge 
recommended they not talk about 
the case because it could affect 
other lawsuits.
Texas is not done with FordFirestone cases yet. Two lawsuits 
challenging Ford and Firestone are 
already scheduled for state court 
on September 10 in Brownsville 
and Laredo.
Cuban exile group seek Castro indictment
MIAMI (AP)  A Cuban exile 
group said Friday it has collected 
more than 100,000 signatures on a 
petition urging US officials to indict 
Fidel Castro for the 1996 fatal down
ing by Cuban fighter jets of two 
planes flown by Cuban-Americans.
Jose Basulto, head of the Cuban 
exile group Brothers to the Rescue, 
said the petitioners support an 
indictment of Castro on charges of 
murder for the deaths of Armando 
Alejandre Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de 
la Pena, and Pablo Morales.
The four were killed February 24, 
1996, when two Cuban MiGs shot 
their planes down over international 
waters. The Brothers to the Rescue
planes were patrolling the area to 
help Cubans fleeing the communist 
island by boat.
Basulto said he has met with 
President Bush, Attorney General 
John Ashcroft and Florida Governor 
Jeb Bush to discuss indicting the 
Cuban leader, and his brother, Raul, 
among others.
So far, only Gerardo Hernandez, 
one of five Cubans convicted in 
Miami on spy charges in June, has 
been charged in the downing of the 
planes. Hernandez was convicted of 
murder-conspiracy in the attack.
The case is being handled in the 
office of Miami-based US Attorney 
Guy Lewis.
We will continue to follow all 
leads and remain aggressive in 
investigating this crime, said 
Aloyma M. Sanchez, a spokes
woman for Lewis office. Sanchez 
declined further comment.
The conservative legal group 
Judicial Watch and the Cuban 
American National Foundation, a 
leading exile group, have also cam
paigned for Castros indictment at 
the state or federal level.
Ed Griffith, a spokesman for 
Miami-Dade State Attorney 
Katherine Fernandez Rundle, said 
there are jurisdictional concerns 
with the state pursuing an indict
ment against Castro.

Student arrested 
for Ohio shooting
CLEVELAND (AP)  A college 
freshman was arrested in his dorm 
room Friday and will face murder 
charges along with another young 
man in the drive-by shooting of a 
13-year-old boy with a BB gun, 
authorities said.
An anonymous tip to the Crime 
Stoppers hot line led to the arrests, 
police said.
Raymond Bozak was hit in the 
back with a pellet while picking 
pears with friends Tuesday.
Police Chief Martin Flask said 
the shooting apparently was a ran
dom prank. Witnesses said the 
gunman laughed after shooting 
the boy.
Andre Beasley, 18, of Euclid, was 
arrested about 12:30 am at the 
University of Toledo, where he had 
arrived the day before for the start 
of classes the next week. He was 
jailed on $250,000 bail.
The suspected driver of the get
away car, Dontell Lassiter, 19, of 
North Olmsted, was arrested 
Thursday evening while working 
at a Wal-Mart.
The two men are being held in 
the Cuyahoga County Jail. Beasley 
is to be arraigned Monday, and 
Lassiters arraignment will be 
sometime next week.
Flask, asked whether the use of 
a BB gun made a difference in the 
case, said he was satisfied that 
murder would be an appropriate
charge.
It was an intentional action 
upon their part, he said.
Dr. Robert Challener, deputy 
Cuyahoga County coroner, said 
the BB penetrated skin, muscle 
and membranes to enter a lung, 
where it nicked a blood vessel.
It was the second time in a week 
that a Cleveland boy was killed in 
a drive-by shooting.
Three men were arrested Tuesday 
in the August 15 shooting of 12-yearold Warren Culbreath, who was hit 
by a bullet that came through the 
wall of his home after he ran inside 
to escape a gang gunfight.
Woman charged 
with murder plot
NEW YORK (AP)  A woman 
injected her wealthy husband with 
dirty needles for a year to try to kill 
him, then placed a $15 down pay
ment to hire a hit man when her 
attempts failed, police said Friday.
Budhwantie Ferri, 41, was 
arrested Thursday night after she 
handed the money to a police 
informant, assistant chief James 
Ward said. She was charged with 
second-degree conspiracy and 
criminal solicitation after allegedly 
offering to pay $20,000 for the 
murder.
Her husband, 64-year-old 
Antonio Ferri, was repeatedly sick
ened by the injections and was 
undergoing medical tests. Police 
described him as a wealthy busi
nessman and real estate owner. He 
called his wife an evil person.
I got sick, and then I realized 
that she was doing something bad, 
he told WPIX-TV.
Lieutenant John Kopp said 
Antonio Ferri wanted to have the 
four-year marriage annulled, which 
could have resulted in his wifes 
deportation to her native Guyana or 
Venezuela, where she is a citizen.
Her attorney, John Burke, did not 
return a telephone call Friday.
Budhwantie Ferri, a nursing stu
dent who works at the Kingsbrook 
Jewish Medical Center nursing 
home, allegedly began taking dirty 
needles home and telling her hus
band she wanted to practice on 
him.
Ward said she injected her hus
band four times and he became sick 
with jaundice, hepatitis, and rashes.
She would inject his arm, pull 
the blood back and push it back in, 
hoping to wash something out of 
these discarded needles, Kopp 
said.
The fifth time Budhwantie Ferri 
tried to inject her husband, he 
refused and she began looking for 
someone to kill him, Kopp said.
She allegedly met the police 
informant through a mutual friend 
and asked him to help her have her 
husband injected with HIV-positive 
blood.
But if that didnt work, the killer 
could run Antonio Ferri over with 
an automobile, his wife said, 
according to the complaint.

Four executed in 
smuggling case
BEIJING (AP)  The government 
has executed four people for their 
roles in an intricate smuggling oper
ation that abducted and sold dozens 
of children in southern China over a 
two-year period, official media said 
Saturday.
The four were executed Friday in 
Guiyang, the capital of the southern 
province of Guizhou, the Legal 
Daily newspaper said. It didnt say 
how they Were killed, but most exe
cutions in China are carried out 
with a bullet in the back of the head 
or neck.
The Guiyang Intermediate Court 
issued the sentences in May after a 
three-day trial, convicting 24 peo
ple in connection with 41 cases of 
kidnapped children. Eight defen
dants were sentenced to die, but 
four of those sentences were 
reduced on appeal, the Legal Daily 
said.
Six other smugglers received life 
sentences, it said; three of those 
were changed to 15-year sentences 
on appeal.
From 1997 to 1999, according to 
the newspaper, the smugglers oper
ated a network for kidnapping and 
selling children, most of them 
extremely young. It did not say how 
or where the children were sold,
though such activity is said to be 
common in the more remote parts 
of China.
Police in Guizhou rescued more 
than 40 kidnapped children while 
investigating the case, the Beijing 
Evening News, another newspaper, 
reported Saturday.
Police charge 
Osama bin Laden
NEW DELHI, India (AP)  
Indian investigators have charged 
suspected terrorist leader Osama 
bin Laden and five others with 
planning to bomb the US Embassy 
in New Delhi, senior police officials 
said Friday.
The charges  filed in a city 
court on August 14 and reported 
Friday in The Times of India news
paper  are based on statements 
by two of the men who were arrest
ed June 14 on charges of possess
ing explosives, Assistant Police 
Commissioner Rajbir Singh said.
US Embassy officials declined to 
comment Friday, as they have done 
since the arrests were first reported 
in June.
In Washington, a senior State 
Department official also had no 
comment beyond saying that the 
United States has been working 
successfully with the Indian gov
ernment in protecting the embassy.
Four of the five suspected con
spirators were being held in the 
capitals Tihar Jail.
The fifth man, alleged master
mind Abdul Rehman A1 Safani of 
Yemen, has fled India, Singh said. 
Bin Laden lives in Afghanistan 
under the protection of the ruling 
Taliban militia.
In June, police in New Delhi 
arrested Abdel Raouf Hawas, 
whom they identified as a 
Sudanese, and Mohammed 
Shamim Sarwar, whose nationality 
has not been released, on charges 
of possessing 13 pounds of explo
sives, detonators, and timers.
Two more men, Abbas Hussain 
Sheikh and Mohammed Arshad, 
both Indians, were arrested on 
charges they helped Hawas.
At the time of the arrests, Deputy 
Police Commissioner Ashok Chand 
told Indian news media that the 
group had been planning for two 
years to park a car bomb close to 
the visa section of the embassy. It is 
considered the most vulnerable 
part of the high-security building 
because hundreds of Indians seek
ing entry to the United States stand 
in line there for hours each day.
The police said Hawas told them 
that Safani was working for bin 
Laden, accused by the United 
States of planning the 1998 bomb
ings of US embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania that killed 224 people.

If you have some time on your hands, we're interested in having 
you participate in our NASA funded research study. NASA 
developed "Appendix-K" a set of rules that governs how and 
when astronauts can safely rearrange their sleep schedules. The 
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine will help the space 
agency determine the safest method for rearranging astronauts' 
sleep schedules to meet time critical mission demands. We are 
recruiting healthy men and women between the ages of 20 to 59 
who are willing to participate individually or in groups of two to 
four (friends encouraged) for 16 days and nights in our Biological 
Rhythms Laboratory (BRL). We will work around your schedule 
preferences. Upon completion of the study, participants will be 
paid $1600.
If you are interested in participating or know someone else 
that might be interested in this research opportunity, contact

Pitt forms committee to explore same-sex benefits policy change; ACLU suit pending upon results
PITT, from page A1
retired vice chairman of BP 
America Advisory Board, repre
sent the Board of Trustees on the 
committee. Executive Vice 
Chancellor Jerry Cochran and Dr 
Randy Juhl, the dean of the 
School of Pharmacy make up the 
administration component. 
Marvin Fein, a School of Law 
professor, and Anne Medsger, a 
Graduate School of Public 
Health professor, represent the 
faculty. The two Pitt staff mem
bers are Rich Colwell and Carol 
James, the President and former 
Vice President of the Staff 
Association Council, respective
ly. Mary Frances Gargotta and 
Ernest Varhola are the two alum
ni representatives and Mike 
Unangst, the former Student 
Government Board President, 
and Stephanie Hoogendoorn, the 
former Graduate and 
Professional Student Association 
President, represent the stu
dents.
The committee was to have 
their first meeting on June 16. 
None of the members would 
comment on the current progress 
on the committee. They plan to 
have their investigation complet
ed within six months and will 
return their results to 
Nordenberg.
Last fall, Pitt persuaded 
Allegheny County Common Pleas 
Judge Robert Gallo to prevent 
the city from hearing the ACLU 
case against Pitt, citing a 1999 
state law exempting state and 
state-related universities from 
any local ordinance that might 
require them to provide such 
health benefits. Then in April,
Gallo brought the case to a halt 
saying that the law removed the 
case from the citys jurisdiction 
and issued a temporary injunc
tion.
If thats what the state 
Legislature intended, then it vio
lates the equal protection clause 
of both the Pennsylvania and the 
U.S. Constitutions because its 
meant to disadvantage lesbians 
and gays as a class, and theres 
no rational basis being
advanced, said ACLU lawyer 
Roslyn Litman in a recent PostGazette article.
When the case was filed in 
1996, the Commission on Human 
Relations found probable cause 
that Pitt had discriminated 
against gays, but Gallo said in 
April that he didnt find Pitts 
current policy to be discrimina
tory.
Pitt has listed two main rea
sons for refusing health care ben
efits for same-sex partners of 
employees. In 1999, the universi
ty claimed that a new benefits 
policy would cost the school 
more than $300,000. According 
to the ACLU, Pitt has now 
claimed the cost would be closer 
to $50,000.
Pitt has also suggested that 
they may lose some of their 
state-related funding if they 
adopted such a policy. In 1999, 
Pitt Trustee J. Wray Connolly 
said in a sworn disposition that 
he would have a problem with 
gays being employed as child 
care workers and, according to a 
recent Pitt News article, former 
Pitt Trustee James Flaherty, who 
left the university in 1995, has 
also been accused of having an
anti-gay bias.
Many other Pennsylvania cam
puses have already adopted 
some form of health benefits for 
same-sex partners, including 
Beaver College, Bucknell 
University, Dickinson College, 
Franklin and Marshall College, 
Susquehanna University,
Swarthmore College, Thomas 
Jefferson University and 
Hospital, the University of 
Pennsylvania, and most recently, 
Carnegie Mellon.
Same-sex couples became eligi
ble for the new health care bene
fit policy at CMU on July 1. The 
University has proposed eligibili
ty rules requiring the couples to 
be in a committed relationship for 
a least a year. The couples must 
also meet several other require
ments, including joint ownership 
of property and the designation of 
each other as beneficiaries of life 
insurance policies.
CMU believes that between 11 
and 15 same-sex couples will be 
able to use the new policy and 
projects the cost to be between 
$50,000 and $100,000 a year.
While CMU dealt with some of 
the same protesting issues that 
Pitt has over the issue, the over
whelmingly pro-benefits vote at 
CMU came for other reasons, 
President Cohon told the PostGazette.
The argument for, and I think 
most Trustees subscribed to this, 
is that first and foremost this is 
an employment, benefit and 
compensation issue, that people 
should be compensated equally 
for equal work, he said. I 
think that was the primary moti
vation of our Trustees.
Five percent of Universitys electricity 
will come from wind-generated power
WIND, from page A1 
chase will eliminate the 
equivalent of 13 tons of 
nitrogen oxides, 35 tons 
of sulfur dioxide, 5,100 
tons of carbon dioxide, 
and 0.18 pounds of mer
cury.
However, wind gener
ated power poses several 
problems that prevent it 
from being able to 
replace traditional 
sources on a large scale.
Wind mills, for instance, 
are expensive and 
require a lot of mainte
nance.
There has been a 
massive backlash that 
the wind generators are 
unsightly, said Cliff 
Davidson, director of 
the CMU Environmental 
Institute and member of 
the environmental prac
tices committee that 
made the decision to
purchase wind power. 
Davidson added that 
people have complained 
about the generators 
being noisy and danger
ous.
Solar and hydrogen 
fuel cells present two 
other alternative forms 
of energy. Yet, Davidson 
said the technology for 
either form is still not 
advanced enough to 
produce energy in mas
sive amounts. Producing 
solar cells uses toxic 
chemicals that are diffi
cult to dispose of safely.
Despite costs to the 
University and safety and 
aesthetic concerns about 
wind turbines, the wind 
power purchase is one 
step in line to a much 
larger goal for CMU. The 
University can move soci
ety towards a sustainable 
state, said Davidson.
Paul Christiano loyally served CMU as 
Provost, professor, dean, and student
CHRISTIANO, from page A1 
Nair emphasized that 
Christiano cared deeply about the 
interests of all students at CMU. 
He would worry about raising 
tuition and about what it would 
mean to the students and their 
parents when the tuition was 
raised, said Nair. She said that 
when Christiano recognized and 
believed that the students needed
something, he would spend what
ever was necessary and worry 
about raising the money later.
In addition to his work at CMU, 
Christiano served on the boards 
of Equitable Resource, Inc., the 
Western Pennsylvania Hospital, 
the United Way, the Civic Light 
Opera, and the Ben Franklin 
Partnership of Western 
Pennsylvania. He also served on
the academic advisory boards at 
the University of Pittsburgh, the 
Pennsylvania State University, 
and the Worchester Polytechnic 
Institute.
Christiano is survived by his 
wife Norene and his daughter Beth 
Christiano Zimick of Shadyside. A 
memorial service for will be held 
on Wednesday, August 29 at 5 pm 
in Porter Hall 100.
Crime and Incident Report
Theft, 8/23/01, 9:44 AM -
A University staff member 
reported to campus police that 
sometime after 2 pm the previ
ous day, someone had entered 
her locked office at GSIA. An 
IBM Laptop Notebook computer 
still in its packing box had been 
removed from the office. The 
computer was valued at $2,300. 
Nothing else had been removed 
from the area.
Grease Fire, 8/23/01, 
2:36 PM - Campus Police 
received a call from the UC 
Original Hot Dog Shoppe that 
they had a grease fire and were 
having problems extinguishing 
it. Four officers responded, 
along with the Pittsburgh Fire 
Bureau. Upon arrival, no signs 
of smoke or fire could be detect
ed. The grease fire had already 
been put out, and O personnel 
were cleaning the area. The O 
manager explained that a small 
fire had started on the flat grid
dle while employees cooked 
chicken. A fire extinguisher had 
been used to put out the flames. 
The O was closed until the area 
could be cleaned and sanitized.
Suspicious Person,
8/23/01, 9:02 PM - While 
conducting a building lockup of 
Wean and Doherty Halls, a cam
pus police officer noticed a male 
looking at the bikes on the Wean 
Hall 5th floor patio bike racks. 
The black male was wearing a 
grey t-shirt, denim shorts, a dark 
colored baseball hat, and blue 
tennis shoes. The officer 
observed the suspicious male 
from the 6th floor of Wean as he 
approached the bike racks 
numerous times. Each time a 
person exited or entered the 
Wean Hall entrance near the 
bike racks, the male would 
abruptly walk away. The officer 
radioed for another officer to 
take a position in Porter Hall to 
watch the suspicious male. The 
two officers observed the male 
as he walked to both the Donner 
Hall and Hamerschlag House 
bike racks. The officers stopped 
the man, who claimed to be look
ing for his friend John. The 
officers told him that if he 
returned to campus, he would be 
arrested for defiant trespassing. 
The man left campus without 
incident.
Accident, 8/24/01, 1:19
PM - A campus police officer was 
dispatched to the Underground 
Caf at the report of an accident. 
A staff member of the 
Underground said that while exit
ing the premises, she had fallen 
forward onto the left side of her 
body: She received bruises to her 
left knee and palm. She believed 
she may have twisted her left 
ankle. The staff member refused 
any medical attention and did not 
wish to be escorted to the hospital 
or Health Center.
- Campus Sergeant Ricci reviews 
all reports prior to release.
- Only three people on The 
Tartan staff see the reports: the 
Editors-in-Chief and the News 
Editor.

THE TARTAN  AUGUST 27, 2001
News Brief:New chief of police hired on campus
Creig William Doyle, the former chief 
of police for the Rehoboth Beach Police 
Department in Delaware, has been 
named Carnegie Mellons new director 
of campus security and began his role 
on August 1. He replaces Jim LaPaglia, 
who died in August 2000. Lieutenant 
Mary Suber has served as the senior 
officer for the past year.
Doyle has more than 30 years of law 
enforcement experience. He began his 
role as the chief of police in Rehoboth 
Beach in June 1991. Before that he 
worked as a sergeant and lieutenant for 
the Metropolitan Police Department in 
Washington, D.C. from 1970 to 1991.
Doyle said that he had been interested 
in finding a campus position for the past 
two years. After talking to the chief of 
police at the University of Delaware, he 
became amazed at the kind of responsi
bilities and tasks the chief was doing on 
campus and his involvement with the 
students. I am delighted that CMU is 
the one that worked out for me, he
said. He also said that hes very used to 
handling student-related issues after 
dealing with college-aged people vaca
tioning at Rehoboth Beach.
Were very glad to have someone of 
Creigs ability and experience on 
board, said Vice President for 
Enrollment William Elliott, who over
sees the campus security department. 
His varied police background, which 
includes working and educating young 
people at Rehoboth Beach for the last 
10 years, his commitment to continuing 
professional development and his inter
personal skills are a great fit for this 
university.
We are delighted that the chief has 
accepted this position. He has exten
sive experience, both in the District of 
Columbia and most recently, as the 
chief in Rehoboth Beach, said Michael 
Murphy, Dean of Student Affairs. He is 
bright and energetic, and it is very clear 
that he enjoys working with students. It 
is a tribute to the entire Campus Police
team that we were able to recruit such 
an outstanding professional to this crit
ical position.
Doyle plans on using this fall semester 
mainly as a break-in period to get 
used to the campus. He wants to work 
to make police on campus more visible, 
He would like students to feel more 
comfortable in their presence. Doyl^ 
also said he wants to work on crime pre
vention through things like safety pre
sentations and the presence of campus 
police at RA and faculty Senate meet
ings.
In 1970, Doyle earned a bachelors 
degree in sociology from Catholic 
University. He received his police certi
fication in 1971 at the Metropolitan 
Police Academy in Washington, D.C. He 
graduated from the FBI National 
Academy, 141st session, in Quantico, 
Virginia in 1985.

GSIA, from page Al 
ate in industrial administra
tion (1979) from Purdue 
University, joined the CMU 
faculty in 1979 as an assis
tant professor of industrial 
administration where in 
1982, he earned the GSIA 
Excellence in Teaching 
Award. He then became a 
tenured professor of finance 
and economics in 1987.
Dunn later took a leave of 
absence from CMU in 1988 to 
become a portfolio manager 
for Miller Anderson & Sherrerd 
where he specialized in mort
gage-backed securities. He 
subsequently left CMU in 1989 
to become a partner at the 
firm, which was acquired by 
Morgan Stanley in 1996.
With the appointment of 
Dunn, GSIA will remain one of 
only four top-20 business 
schools to have a business 
executive serve as dean. GSIAs 
previous Dean Dunn, who was
among the first business school 
deans to come from both an 
academic and business back
ground, believes his succes
sors experience in both acade
mia and the business world 
will be of great benefit to the 
school. The incumbent Dunn, 
former Vice President of visual 
communications and multime
dia strategy at AT&T, feels 
Dunn will bring an excellent 
mix of academic and real world 
experience. In particular, his 
knowledge of Wall Street and 
real world finance will 
strengthen our programs and 
help GSIA build stronger con
nections with the countrys 
financial markets. Dean Dunn 
noted that GSIA remains disad
vantaged in that it lacks the 
strong ties with the nations 
financial centers that other top 
business schools, like the 
University of Pennsylvanias 
Wharton and New York 
Universitys Stern, have established. He believes Dunns con
nections will help to bridge 
that gap, further enhancing 
GSIAs reputation.
The search for a new GSIA 
dean began last fall when Dean 
Dunn announced he would not 
seek an additional term, end
ing his tenure June 30, 2002. 
In January, the Provosts Office 
formed a search committee 
consisting of faculty members 
from many of the schools aca
demic sectors. The elevenmember panel included repre
sentatives from the areas of 
economics, finance, organiza
tional behavior and theory, 
information systems, account
ing, international manage
ment, and humanities and the 
social sciences. Students, 
alumni and other members of 
the campus community were 
also active in the selection 
process. The committee con
sidered some 90 potential can
didates for the position.

CMUs new drinking policy 
offers promising new aspects
This fall, Campus Police has imple
mented a new alcohol and medical 
assistance policy designed to protect 
students from serious harm due to con
sumption of alcohol. This is a positive 
step taken by Campus Police in the 
interest of the community they serve. 
Hopefully, students will take advantage 
of this new policy and allow it to effec
tively reduce the seriousness of alcohol 
incidents on campus.
The policy boils down to not punish
ing intoxicated students who seek med
ical attention for fellow students. This is 
accomplished by granting amnesty for 
disciplinary action against the caller as 
well as the student requiring medical 
attention, under the condition that the 
caller stays with the ill student.
Under previous policy, the student 
requiring medical attention would be 
granted amnesty, but the caller would 
not; hence, callers would be anonymous 
and leave the ill student alone in order 
to escape punishment. As the new poli
cy is worded, it also grants conditional 
amnesty to any individual or organiza
tion involved in such an incident when 
appropriate medical attention is 
sought.
This policy will be especially benefi
cial for organizations. Prior to the 
implementation of this policy, members 
of some organizations may have 
neglected to call the proper help in a 
timely fashion in an alcohol-related 
event for fear of getting their organiza
tion in trouble. Now, hopefully that fear 
will be lessened and the health of the 
student will be placed first.
Last week during orientation, the new 
policy was applied for the first time. A
student needing medical attention, and 
city paramedics eventually arrived to 
assist EMS. No one involved was cited 
for any violation and the fraternity was 
thankful that the police and EMS 
arrived promptly.
The policy does allow some potential 
for abuse by organization. It would be 
feasible for an organization to report a 
minor medical problem to intentionally 
exempt themselves from underage 
drinking citations. However, as stated in 
the policy, while no disciplinary action 
will be taken by the police, there is a 
possibility for "appropriate educational 
or developmental interventions" which 
will hopefully deter students from call
ing in non-emergency situations.
Of course, any emergency which goes 
beyond the scope of EMS or Campus 
Police potentially comes under the juris
diction of City of Pittsburgh, and they 
make no such guarantees of amnesty.
A committee of faculty and staff, 
including Director of Student Life Renee 
Camerlengo, Dean Michael Murphy, 
and Director of Health Services Anita 
Barkin, developed the new procedure in 
the interest of making the students less 
fearful of reporting alcohol-related inci
dents and in preventing possibly deadly 
situations. Campus Police and others 
involved should be commended for 
their efforts in developing this policy. 
However, their efforts will only be 
worthwhile if students actually take 
advantage of this policy. Therefore, 
every student should make it their 
responsibility to report any alcoholrelated incident they are witness to 
since now they dont need to fear pun
ishment for themselves or the ill indifraternity brother called EMS to report a vidual.Power initiative shows new 
commitment to environment
Carnegie Mellon has taken a great 
step forward by deciding to purchase

on the cutting edge of technology,

University has on the world around it.

after business hours.
With this action, CMU will be the 
largest consumer of wind-generated

No other corporation, university, or 
organization can make this claim. 
While nations argue over emission pro

that we have not only a bright, but a 
clean future.

Sara Stille/Co-Editor-in-Chief'Cloning issue lacks thoughtful discussion
Christian Restifo
My wife and I often joke that 
weve given our son even odds 
when it comes to a healthy 
life. True, many of her family 
members have died of heartrelated conditions, but usually 
when they were very, very old. 
In my family, making it to 
60 without dropping over is 
an accomplishment.
It is for this reason that Im 
particularly concerned about 
the current debate over stem 
cells and cloning. Given my 
familys history of diabetes, 
cancer, and whatnot, I would 
like for my son to someday 
have available to him medical 
techniques to even out the 
odds. Once the stuff of sci
ence fiction, stem cells and 
cloning may one day funda
mentally alter medical science.
However, many thorny 
issues exist. Is it moral to 
clone a child who dies in a car 
accident? Will people one 
day have their own organs 
removed and replaced with 
genetically superior ones that 
were cloned from themselves 
and genetically modified? 
Should scientists be allowed 
to harvest embryos specifi
cally for developing stem 
cells? Under what condi
tions? Should the federal 
government fund research? 
Does or should the govern
ment even have the power to 
regulate or interfere with 
such actions?
Unfortunately, instead of 
having an open debate on the 
true ethical and moral issues, 
weve been reduced to pre
historic Neanderthals run
ning from the evils of our 
first solar eclipse. And we can 
thank the President and 
the House of Representatives 
for it.
Bush recently limited feder
al funding of stem cell 
research to 60 lines of already 
existing stem cells. Doing so, 
he claimed, permitted scien
tists to pursue potential break
throughs while still preventing 
the federal government from 
funding future research 
derived from destroyed 
embryos. In plain English, he 
means future research derived 
from abortion.
By doing this, Bush may 
appease both supporters of 
research and opponents of 
abortion, but hes inhibiting 
both debate and research. 
Many scientists already ques
tion the 60 stem cell lines. 
Only around a dozen exist in 
published literature, and not 
all of the 60 may even be use
ful. Stem cell and cloning 
research are at the point 
where federal funding is 
required to seed this new 
technology. When potentially 
hundreds or even thousands 
of useful lines could be 
developed, Bushs decision 
ties scientists hands behind 
their backs.
As for the ethical issues, Bush 
completely ignores the question
from IVF), was a person ever 
really created? I do not argue 
yes or no, but merely submit to 
you that framing such a ques
tion in the context of abortion 
accomplishes little.
Bushs decision also inap
propriately restricted both dis
cussion and research because 
it was made by one man. True, 
he consulted with many, 
many, people about it, but 
such an important issue 
should not be left to one per
son. I find it rather ironic that 
conservatives, who often 
decried Clintons law by exec
utive order actions, havent 
applied the same criticism to 
Bush.
Of course, leaving the debate 
up to the legislature doesnt 
guarantee thoughtful discus
sion of the issues. Perhaps even 
more pathetic than Bushs 
decision is the recent vote by 
the House of Representatives 
to ban all cloning of human 
beings. While the issue of
Is it moral to clone a child who 
dies in a car accident? Will people 
one day have their own organs 
removed and replaced with 
genetically superior ones...?
of the source and eventual fate 
of the embryos. What about 
embryos left over from in-vitro 
fertilization (IVF) attempts? 
Why are unwanted frozen 
embryos given a different sta
tus than ones that were already 
destroyed? Is it ethical for a 
couple to produce embryos 
for pay? If a woman wants to 
use embryos to generate stem 
cells to treat a condition, does 
the man who fathered them 
have an interest?
Unfortunately, the issue of 
abortion drove most of Bushs 
decision-making process. And 
this, my friends, is sad, espe
cially when you consider IVF 
and intent. If someone creates 
an embryo specifically for the 
purpose of creating stem cells 
(or uses a leftover embryo
cloning and bringing to term a 
human being does have serious 
ramifications, the House mis
takenly lumped it in therapeu
tic cloning.
In that process, DNA (a term, 
I bet, most Representatives do 
not understand) is extracted 
from a person and injected into 
an egg from which original 
DNA material has been 
removed. The egg is allowed to 
develop into an embryo, at 
which point the embryo is 
destroyed and the stem cells 
(about 100-120) are harvested. 
These cells could then be used 
to regenerate specialized cells 
in the body.
Therapeutic cloning offers a 
distinct advantage in that the 
genetic makeup of the stem 
cells is the same as the patients.
Rejection by the immune sys
tem should be non-existent 
since the bodys defense system 
would recognize the cells as 
being part of the body.
Rather than acknowledge 
the potential benefits of thera
peutic cloning, the House 
banned it outright. Bush sup
ports such a ban, but thankful
ly, the bill will probably die in 
the Senate.
Both Bush and opponents of 
therapeutic cloning offer the 
alternatives of adult stem cells 
and the possibility of pleuripotent stem cells, or cells already 
in the human body that could 
theoretically become any 
other type of cell. While we 
should certainly pursue these 
options, using them as an 
excuse for not investigating10 
therapeutic cloning andw
embryonic stem cells reeks of17 
bad science policy.
If Bush and his supporter^ 
could guarantee me today 
that such cells would work, 
Id support withholding fed
eral funding of embryonic 
cells if only to shut people up. 
However, they cannot provide 
that guarantee. One cannot 
dictate which technology will 
and will not work. And to 
frame ethical and moral 
debates in this way is to argue 
in a vacuum.
Theres more to this debate 
than just the morality of 
cloning a human being or har
vesting stem cells. While we 
wrestle with the issues, were 
losing ground to the rest of the 
world. Britain, which has han
dled the whole issue in a much 
more mature manner, already 
plans on setting up a stem cell 
center that would provide 
researchers and companies 
with as many lines as they can 
make. Weve already lost one 
prominent researcher to Britain 
because of our restrictive poli
cies and our refusal to seriously 
debate the issues. Do we really 
want to become the medieval 
Europe of biotechnology?

Culture shock: switching roles in new settings
ILZZi-i
Kathleen A. Fischer
Before you come to college for your 
freshman year, everyone older seems to 
say the same thing: college goes so fast, 
it will fly by, blah, blah. I guess this is 
true, as I suddenly find myself a senior 
(when did that happen?) . But moreover, 
I find that my years have been a series of 
observing and then becoming.
For example: the summer of 1998, 
finding out that my roommate was a girl 
from Germany who lived on a street 
with a name 17 letters long. I remember 
thinking that was pretty cool; I was 
going to have an international student 
as my roommate. And it was. We 
became friends pretty quickly. As we 
became more comfortable with each 
other, I became her resource for her 
many questions about English (what a 
difficult language to explain and ratio
nalize!) and about American culture 
that I simply never thought to notice.
Why is Jerry Springer popular? What is 
a bagel? Why are borrow and lend 
two separate verbs when it could be just 
one? And how on earth do you spell 
Chad or Meredith? Really, I became 
a walking dictionary and encyclopedia 
for my international roommate. I felt 
wise and helpful as I assisted her with 
her adjustment to the United States and 
to Carnegie Mellon. As much I hate to 
admit it, I would imagine I was also 
somewhat ethnocentric, as I proudly 
explained American culture.
This summer, we had a unique chance 
to reverse roles and for me to reevaluate 
any ethnocentric tendencies. I lived 
with my roommate in Paris and I did not 
have anywhere near the level of lan
guage skill that she possessed when she 
came to the U.S. In the days before I left 
for France, my anxiety level surpassed 
that of the freshman year jitters. I could 
not believe that I was leaving the com
fort and security of the United States 
and of my native tongue to live some
place where I hardly spoke the lan
guage. To make matters worse, I kept
hearing unfair stereotypes about the 
stuck-up Parisians and how they hate 
Americans. I had no idea what to expect 
of anyone or anything, except that I 
would have my roommate to protect and 
guide me.
I arrived in Paris to find that our 
tables had turned. I was no longer the 
one with the international roommate. 
Instead, I was hers. I was used to being 
her book of answers, now she was mine. 
My comfort zone was invaded by not 
being able to answer my own questions. 
My sense of ordinary and extraordinary 
changed as I observed my surroundings, 
the people, and the language. All day, I 
would watch what was happening 
around me and compile lists of ques
tions about the language and about 
French culture and then fire inquiries 
and observations at my roommate.
She learned to read my face, just as I 
had learned to read hers when we were 
freshmen. We each developed distinct 
expressions of confusion, which was the 
others cue to step in and explain.
See PARIS, page A 7

Student reevaluates ethnocentric tendencies from abroad
PARIS, from page A6
She learned to read my expression that sig
naled when I was actually comprehending 
a conversation in French. This was my 
favorite expression, because it was reward
ed with a smile of delight from my room
mate. On the other hand, I loved watching 
her converse in German, or French, or
English, all with ease and skill. Man, was 
I jealous.
So my roommate watched me struggle 
and attempt to speak French and to under
stand my surroundings. She beamed with 
pride and happiness at my broken French. 
Really, we had come full circle. I had been 
her interpreter and sounding board for her
challenges in the United States. But then 
she saw me go through what she had been 
doing for three years: watching, listening, 
and learning a culture and doing my best to 
blend in.
Now that I am back in the United States, 
safe and sound in Pittsburgh, I will main
tain a new perspective that my internation
al roommate has reinforced for me: Beware 
of ethnocentricity and remember that there 
is always a place where I may be the one on 
the outside looking in.

Estimation errors: Federal surplus numbers do not add up
David M. Anderson
Last week, the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB), a White House agency, 
released a new federal government projec
tion of its finances for the rest of the fiscal 
year and for the next several years. These 
numbers showed that the federal budget is 
still running a 156 billion dollar federal sur
plus for the current fiscal year. Only two bil
lion dollars, plus or minus a couple hundred 
million dollars (small rounding errors) are 
from general revenue. The rest of the current 
year surplus is from either the Social Security 
surplus or from Medicare A hospital insur
ance surplus. This is a drastic change from 
projections made in January where there 
was a projected current year surplus of non
trust fund revenue of over one hundred 
billion dollars.
Next week, the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) will release their numbers for 
the current year and their projections for the 
future. Most likely, these estimates will be 
much more pessimistic than the OMB projec
tions. The difference in accounting and pro
jections between these two branches of gov
ernment result from several factors: First, 
different economists will project different 
patterns of revenue and economic growth 
because they weigh different factors. The 
OMB currently is assuming that the United 
States will grow at approximately 3.2 percent 
next year, while the Federal Reserve survey 
of private economists, and other noted pri
vate economic forecasts project growth 
between 2.6 to 2.8 percent. The CBO also 
uses different accounting techniques that 
would show that the government is dipping 
into trust fund surpluses this year, assuming 
that it was using the OMBs projections.
These numbers released by the OMB and 
CBO will, and have already, started a massive 
mud-slinging campaign by partisans and ide
ologues of both parties. The Democrats will 
correctly point out that the Bush tax give
away carries massive opportunity costs while 
the President and his party will attempt to 
shrink social programs in order to balance 
the budget with only general revenue. 
However, one should apply a tauro-fecal test 
to both arguments because the numbers are 
wrong, especially in the long term.
Both the OMB and the CBO are con
strained by the fact that they have to pretend 
that the politicians of both parties are telling 
the truth, regardless of reality and that cur
rent tax and appropriation laws will extend 
into the future of the projection. These legal
ly mandated assumptions mean that these 
two projections pretend that the Department 
of Defense will only receive small increases 
in real purchasing power over the next four 
years, while reality has shown that Bush has 
requested an additional nineteen billion dol
lars this year and that the Rumsfield Review 
would probably need hundreds of billions of 
dollars to fully carry out. It ignores the dis
tinct possibility that any National Missile 
Defense system will cost more than the hun
dred billion dollars put aside for it, seeing 
that no anti-missile project has ever come in 
on time, on budget and in working condi
tion. It ignores the fact that the alternative 
minimum tax will be affecting millions of 
middle and upper middle class voters in the 
next five years. These voters will demand a 
fix in the tax code, one that will most likely 
cost the government a couple hundred bil
lion dollars in lost revenue. It ignores the 
thirty-five billion dollars in Bush campaign 
paybacks to Enron and other energy compa
nies. The story is that these numbers are
incomplete and near fantasy.
So what is the reality? I would contend that 
the current fiscal reality is that the federal 
government will be drawing upon trust fund 
revenue within the next four months because 
of a combination of the advance on next 
years tax refunds disguised as a rebate, and a 
slower economy. The general revenue surplus 
has effectively been blown on a tax cut that 
does not cost 1.35 trillion dollars over ten 
years, but as the International Monetary 
Fund contends, 2.5 trillion dollars. The feder
al government will not have the money to do 
anything new or important because of the fis
cal straitjacket currently imposed. The only 
way that new programs, advanced by either 
party, can be funded without deficit spending 
is by corresponding cuts in other programs, 
or by increasing taxes. The cold, hard finan
cial truth of no surpluses in general revenue 
will overcome the sophistry of Bush and the 
OMB and the intentional, legally mandated 
naivete of the CBO. I did not like the 1980s, 
but it looks like we may try that mistake 
again. Beware!

Part one of two: What I am fairly certain I did last summer
But, Seriously...
Sean Mintus
Another year! Hoo Ha! What a 
good time itll be. Hey, kids. Hope 
the summer was tolerable at best. 
May your backs be tan, your bellies 
swollen with beer, and your sexual 
desires fulfilled. Because if they 
arent, tough luck.
Another year. Sweet Christ, its 
depressing. Two more semesters 
of- tests, papers, coding, bad food, 
worse relationships, and fighting 
that pesky Ritalin addiction. Lets 
face it, this place sucks and those 
who manage to have their fun 
while simultaneously keeping 
their heads about them are few 
and far between, so Ill dispense 
with the pleasantries.
Time to focus on a brighter, 
warmer time: that of the summer 
months. Seems as though Im going 
to buckle and indulge in a shame
lessly self-incriminating and sappy 
chronicle of the summer, dedicated 
to those who somehow saved it.
These are not happy times for the 
land. All of those poor information 
systems majors are out of work, vic
tims of an industry that assured 
them that they werent worthless. 
The stock market is shaky at best. 
Comedy Central stopped running 
Kids in the Hall every night. And 
Dubya turned out to be a much big
ger pussy than I had feared. Im not 
gonna lie to you, times are rough. 
Time to hunker down and weather 
the storm.
Before I set this years sardonic 
ball a-rolling, allow me to explain 
the impetus behind this, my first 
ever two-part column. Most of the 
time, when a journalist chooses to 
divide a piece, it is done in an effort 
to cram in more material, to eluci
date ideas, and provide the reader
with an in-depth look at the issues at 
hand. I, however, have chosen to 
split this entry in two because I fully 
expect it to take upwards often days 
to figure out what in Gods name 
went on over the past three and a 
half months. But I will prevail. After 
all, I am a journalist, a loyal and hon
orable servant of the student popu
lous who refuses to forsake his craft 
no matter how hard it might be to 
discern the letters on the keyboard.
I sit here typing away, having 
just woken up from a seemingly 
endless spell of cruel, senseless, 
unholy debauchery. From notes 
scrawled on various scraps of 
paper, empty beer cases, and vari
ous parts of my body, along with 
several microcassettes,, citations, 
and with the aid of the few friends 
who survived, Ive begun to orga
nize and reconstruct a particularly 
hazy period in my life. As these 
memories come floating back 
through my tattered cerebral 
mass, I am beginning to fully real
ize what a perfectly horrid mess I 
managed to make of myself and 
anyone foolish enough to come 
within a two-mile radius of 
my residence.
May 1 -4: Finals crunch time
Ill be as brief as possible here, in 
that anything having to do with 
academics has no right existing in 
this column. All-in-all, the high 
speed burn fueled by a careful com
bination of the three As, (ability, 
ambition, and amphetamines) that 
has become characteristic of many 
a CMU finals period turned out 
quite well. All work was finished 
and turned in as close to deadline 
as humanly possible. Id disclose 
my GPA, but Id hate to show up all 
of you poor fools who did work 
throughout the semester as 
opposed to right at the end.
May 4-20: Post-finals relaxation 
period
I vaguely recall dropping off a 
few freshly completed papers and a 
portfolio at around 1:30 pm, after 
which, Im told, I joined several 
friends at the PHI. A friend later 
informed me that I was beaten, ren
dered unconscious, and then beat
en again by five members of Pitts 
lacrosse team after having tackled 
one of their girlfriends in an 
attempt to carve a Nittany Lion into 
her forehead.
I suspect that no fewer that three 
of the five teeth I lost this summer 
are stuck to the floor of my favorite 
drinking establishment. 
Nevertheless, I must have gotten a 
few good shots in, as indicated by the 
piece of ear later found floating in 
my toilet next to approximately four 
liters of Yuengling and some Srees.

How I honestly expected to hold

June 13: CMU gets rich(er)
The official figures for the 
Centennial Campaign found their 
way into my grimy paws. 
Apparently, the total had rested at 
a respectable $142.07, until an 
anonymous (military) donation of 
just over 415 million dollars 
arrived at the zero-hour, bringing
the grand total to $410.3 million. 
When asked where the remaining 
five million dollars went, 
President Cohon responded with 
Oh my God! Look behind you! 
Its Godzilla!
I tried desperately to chase the 
slimy power monger down and con
tinue the interview, but the six FMS 
employees carrying him around on 
an elevated platform fashioned 
with a solid gold throne were at a 
severe advantage, in that they could 
make their bodies move in a straight 
line. Luckily, I managed to croak 
one of them with an empty handle 
of Tanqueray to the back of the skull 
just before passing out.
Incidentally, my first run-in with 
the authorities occurred later that 
evening. After crashing Don Hales 
going-away party and urinating on 
the oysters in a whiskey and PCPinduced rage while screaming ubi 
libertas ibi partria, at the top of my 
lungs, it took a reported seven offi
cers to drag me away from Hales car 
as I attempted to pour two pounds of 
granulated sugar into the gas tank. 
The judge, a CMU alumnus, dis
missed the case immediately on 
account that my actions, in his eyes, 
were completely justified, and that 
congratulations were in order.
Thats it for this week. As it was 
explained to me earlier, 1400 
words puts us in a whole new liabil
ity bracket. But just to bait the 
hook, next week involves a party to 
end all parties, the University try
ing yet again to kick me out, the 
much-maligned Jagr deal, and a 
man named Tom Petty. Tune in 
next time, same section, same 
strategically filtered social com
mentary. Keepwell.

THE TARTAN  AUGUST 27,2001
rTrade for Rocker damaged Indians rotation
MLB, from page A10
Early in the season, Steve Reed, 
Steve Karsay, and Bob Wickman 
Anchored what may have been the 
ijiost solid rotation in the league. 
Shortly before the trading dead
line, however, Reed and Karsay 
Vi/ere history and Wickman was 
unceremoniously demoted to a set
up role to make way for Rocker.
In his first month with 
Cleveland, all Rocker has done is 
go 3-6 while only converting two 
of five save opportunities, quickly 
handing the closers role right back 
to Wickman.
I witnessed one of the blown 
saves in person, when Rocker 
entered the game in the ninth and 
promptly surrendered four runs. 
Fortunately, the Indians were able 
to rally that time, and won in extra 
innings.
Even in the set-up role Rocker 
has done just a passable job, at 
best. Last Saturday, he literally
handed a game to the Mariners in 
the eleventh inning by issuing a 
lead-off walk, an infield single, 
and then allowing the winning run 
to score by making a wild throw to 
first on a bunt attempt.
I dont know if General Manager 
John Hart was trying to make one 
last splash before leaving the team 
at the end of the season or what, 
but this trade didnt even make 
sense on paper.
The Indians needed pitching, 
sure, but not in the bullpen, and 
especially not at the expense of 
two valuable set-up guys. Yes, in 
theory, having an effective leftyrighty closer combination would 
be a very impressive sight, but 
dont forget that, in theory, 
Communism works.
Switching over to the NL, we 
have Barry Bonds not-so-exciting 
chase of history. Maybe its 
because hes chasing a record 
thats only three years old or
maybe its his surly attitude 
towards everyone, but the mania 
that surrounded Mark McGwire 
and Sammy Sosa in 98 is sorely 
lacking this year.
The best case of fan indecision 
Ive seen was at a game in PNC 
Park last April (admittedly, this 
example happened before the 
home run chase really began, but it 
really proves my point) when 
Bonds was booed as he stepped up 
to the plate, only to receive a 
standing ovation after crossing it 
again after smashing one over the 
center field wall.
Personally, I dont think Bonds 
will get to 70 this year, mostly 
because the Giants are right in the 
middle of a very tight, three-team 
pennant race. Considering that 
half of San Franciscos remaining 
games are against the teams 
theyre competing with (Arizona 
and Los Angeles), Bonds inten
tional walk numbers are going to
increase geometrically (for you 
non-math majors, that means the 
numbers are getting really big real
ly fast) in the next week or two.
As for the pennant races them
selves, Im going to leave closer 
examination for a later installment 
of this column. I will, however, say 
that the intra-division heavy 
scheduling is going to pay off big 
time in the coming month.
Currently, 10 teams are fighting 
for four division crowns (I consider 
the AL Central race over, given the 
Twins recent free-fall), and that 
doesnt even include the Wild 
Card. All I know for sure is that 
staying focused on studying is 
going to be a difficult task in the 
foreseeable future.
Matt Brun guiltily admits that he 
had given up on the IndiansAugust 
15 game against the Mariners. He 
did make it back to the TV for all of 
the best parts, though.
Tartans need to better 
utilize passing attack
FEAR, from page A10 
Zimpfers knack for the impetuous 
can generate great results. Last 
season, Zimpfer rushed for 525 
net yards while seeing his playing 
time limited due to a shoulder 
injury.
His ability to scramble outside 
the pocket and draw in defenders 
can. create passing opportunities 
downfield. And in keeping with 
Pittsburgh tradition, who will 
Zimpfer pass to?
The Tartans have passed to 
their tight end about three or four 
times ... a season. The offense not 
only needs to pass to the tight 
ends, but also utilize one of the 
most effective route-runners in 
senior Matt Saneholtz. A more 
potent pass attack will grant 
Zimpfer more options when out
side the tackles.
If CMU chooses to utilize this 
crazy forward pass, who knows 
what roads it will lead them to. 
They may score more than 10 
points in a conference game (once 
again, Case excluded as a statisti
cal anomaly). The Tartans may 
win the UAA. And maybe students 
will become faithful Tartan fanat
ics. Then again, some subjects are 
better left for the poor alternative 
reality of television.
Its not Fear Factor. Its not the 
OReilly factor. Its Sportsline, the 
show that the public fears so prodi
giously that they dont even listen 
in. If you have the guts, tune in to 
88.3 Tuesday at 10 pm to hear host 
Brad Grantz and an assorted band 
of characters more crowded than 
the CMU backfield.
Football squad faces some tough questions
FOOTBALL, from page A10ac
|MG
r 6. How does the defense 
replace Nick Zitelli?
1 Actually, CMU got a glimpse of 
this last season, as Zitelli was 
injured for part or all of three 
games last season. In his absence 
Mike Hubbert and Lou Depaul 
were up to task. With both Depaul 
and Zitelli gone, look for Hubbert 
to team with either junior John 
Kaweki or University of 
Pennsylvania transfer Matt 
Simpson.
5. How does the offense 
replace deep threat Mike 
McLaughlin?
Two words: Sebastian Smelko. 
It is not uncommon for quarter
back recruits at CMU to change 
positions. Smelkos athleticism 
Should not be left out of the lineiip. Not only can he can stretch 
ihe defense to allow a more varied 
offensive assault, but he can also 
take the pressure off of Zimpfer. 
The senior QB will no doubt be 
the target of hungry, oversized 
defensemen.
4. Who carries the ball?
So many talented backs, only 
one ball. CMUs Wing-T offense 
features three backs, so expect a 
running back by committee 
approach, with carries being 
spread to as many as six running 
backs, not including Zimpfer, who 
tallied 525 net yards last season.
3. Will the Tartans end 
their Homecoming Jinx?
For the past three years, CMU 
has come up short on 
Homecoming. In 1998 the Tartans 
fell 9-7 to Chicago. In 1999 the 
Highlanders dropped a heartbreaker 7-3 game to Dickinson. 
Last season, the Tartans were 
thoroughly dominated by 
Chicago, falling behind 17-0 and 
eventually losing 20-6. This year 
wont be any easier, as perennial 
powerhouse and archrival Wash U 
comes for a visit.
2. Speaking of punts, who 
will replace All-UAA punter 
Matt Young?
Several freshmen dot the roster, 
but time will tell if one is as reli
able as the former quarterback. 
Young pinned opponents deep in 
their own zone. Punters are the 
Rodney Dangerfields of football,
and this year will be no exception.
1. Can the Tartan offense 
break double digits against 
UAA foes Chicago and Wash 
U?
In the past three games versus 
Chicago, CMU has scored a com
bined 26 points (seven points in 
1998, 13 points in 1999, and six 
points in 2000). In the past two 
fights, the Tartan offense has cre
ated a combined ten points (7 
points in 1999 and three points in 
2000). The common theme in all 
those brouhahas was CMUs 
inability to effectively control the 
line of scrimmage. Last year 
Chicago held the Scots to -1 yard 
net rushing for the game. Quite 
amazing when one considers that 
the Tartans are a team that prides 
themselves on running the foot
ball.

Thistledown
Randolph-Macon College (0-0) v. 
CMU (0-0). Saturday, 1 pm at 
Gesling Stadium. WRCT 88.3 FM.
This is the first meeting between 
the two squads.
The skinny: Try not to confuse 
RMC with RMWC - RandolphMacon Womens College. Its easy 
to do considering the Yellowjackets 
finished 3-7 and 2-4 in the Old 
Dominion Athletic Conference. 
However, the Bees return 14 
starters including 6'2" junior quar
terback Hunter Price. The Jackets 
play a spread offense, a strategy 
employed by many CMU oppo
nents. Using four wideouts against 
the Tartans in 2000 kept teams 
close against the Tartans, but nei
ther Franklin and Marshall nor 
Alfred were victorious.
Watch for: Price led the Jackets 
in rushing with 499 yards on 162 
carries and was ranked 15th 
nationally in total offense per 
game. Junior free safety Bobby 
Akers accumulated 45 tackles and 
recorded one interception.
Result: The Tartan defense will 
hinder any running game the 
Jackets can muster. Like CMU, 
RMC and Price enter the season 
without a favorite passing target. 
If Price chooses to be somewhat 
patient with the passing attack, 
the Jackets could keep the game 
close. A prediction of a score 
would be premature. Come 
Saturday with your portable radio

Columnist wraps up eventful MLB summer
A View from the Bleachers
by Matt Brun
Welcome back to another glori
ous September, or, at least, very 
late August. As we here at CMU 
prepare to dig in for another long 
semester shuffling between vari
ous classrooms and clusters (A 
bed? Whats that?), we baseball 
fans can take comfort from the 
fact that meaningful baseball is 
being played all around us.
I thought about starting off the 
first column of the year by revisit
ing the storylines I pointed out in 
my preview article last spring, but 
since I cant find that piece, Im 
back to what I usually do: ram
bling about whatever comes to 
mind. This week, my thoughts are 
still focused on what turned out 
to be quite an eventful summer in 
the world of baseball.
As crunch time approaches, Ive 
finally decided to admit that the 
Mariners are for real. Consider 
that the Athletics (my pre-season 
pick to win the AL West) would be 
within two games of the lead in 
any other division, but sit a stag
gering 20 games behind Seattle in 
the standings.
The thing that gets me, though, 
is that the Mariners shouldnt be 
this good. Ive seen many of their 
games lately, and havent been 
impressed. They consistently play 
just above the level of their com
petition, never winning big, but 
eking out the victory all the same.
While Im thinking about the 
Mariners, I have to say that I am 
going to be physically ill the next 
time I hear someone rave about 
Ichiro Suzuki. Granted, he is a 
good all-around player who fully 
deserved to start in the All-Star 
Game (even without the billion or 
so votes he got from Japan), but 
he is not the second coming of 
Ricky Henderson.
Until the Indians went into a
team-wide hitting slump last 
week, Ichiro was ranked no high
er than third in the AL in batting 
average behind both Roberto 
Alomar and RBI machine Juan 
Gonzalez.
Furthermore, the discussion of 
whether or not Ichiro should be 
eligible for the Rookie of the Year 
award due to his previous experi
ence in Japan will quickly become 
a moot point because he doesnt 
deserve it. Even if he hangs on to 
the league lead in batting aver
age, his numbers as a leadoff hit
ter arent that impressive. He 
ranks eleventh in the league in 
doubles and a distant fifteenth in 
on-base percentage, the standard 
by which all great leadoff hitters 
are judged.
Meanwhile, rookie pitcher C.C. 
Sabathia has been a left-handed 
godsend for the Indians. As of last 
Saturday, Sabathia had a record 
of 13-4 with 125 strikeouts and 
an ERA of 4.58. The strikeout and 
ERA numbers rank him second in 
the teams rotation behind wouldbe ace Bartolo Colon, a position 
he also holds in number of 
innings pitched.
Right now, Ichiros popularity 
gives the Seattle outfielder an 
edge, but should Sabathia contin
ue on his present pace and reach 
the 15-win plateau, itd be high
way robbery to take the award 
away from him.
The problem the Indians have, 
of course, is that the rest of the 
pitching staff has decided to take 
the year off. The starters have 
pitched the fewest innings of any 
rotation in the bigs, and the for
merly solid bullpen has recently 
gone south, too. Not coincidental
ly, the bullpen collapse came right 
around the time Cleveland traded 
two of their best set-up guys to 
Atlanta for infamous closer John 
Rocker.
See MLB, page A9
More aggressive offense would 
strike fear into UAA opponents
Yinzer Yak place ranking in the UAA. Despite would only hasten their depaiYinzer Yak
by Brad Grantz
It is becoming a rite of passage 
for Carnegie Mellons football 
team. Hone their skills against an 
undermatched opponent in week 
one. Lance the Case Western 
Spartans with a dagger as sharp as 
Dennis Millers wit. Face an adver
sary of equal talents in the third or 
fourth week and find out if the 
squad has the ability to succeed in 
the University Athletic 
Association.
After the paltry three game con
ference slate (Case Western 
excluded), the iron-gridders no 
doubt will finish the year with an 
above .500 mark and begin prepa
rations for the following season.
While it has been a storyboard 
for success the past 26 years that 
many fans, players, and coaches 
would savor, in America logic has 
no place in the short term. With 
that non sequitur aphorism in the 
forefront of my mind, I exclaim 
that I want progress. Now.
The Tartans youthful exuber
ance became maligned inexperi
ence on several occasions last year, 
leading to a 6-4 finish and a thirdplace ranking in the UAA. Despite 
the significant losses of Mike 
McLaughlin at wide receiver and 
Nick Zitelli at inside linebacker, 
one would count on the Tartans to 
improve upon last seasons perfor
mance for several reasons.
I choose not to dwell on the fac
tors for a better season. Optimism 
is reserved for stewardesses and 
the Mayor of Pittsburgh. 
Sportswriters and happiness are 
about as compatible as GW and 
Dick Cheney.
 This season is about fear. As 
always, the students fear attend
ing a football game. Poor student 
attendance is an enigma that even 
the defunct Carnegie Mellon 
Research Institute could not solve. 
Regardless, fear needs to be an 
outcome of the 2001 campaign.
Washington University and the 
University of Chicago have 
become formidable opponents. 
Another season sweep and they 
become superior opponents. The 
University of Rochester illustrated 
last season that they are no longer 
a rich mans Case Western.
With their withdrawal from the 
UAA imminent, another impres
sive season by the Yellowjackets
would only hasten their departure. 
A four-team conference will dis
solve quicker than Alka-Seltzer  
and the taste will be more bitter.
The concept of an academicfirst, football-second conference 
was novel at its inception and 
remains an honorable institution. 
It represents the ideal state of ath
letics and education. Of course, 
many high schools and colleges 
alike find that idea quite befud
dling (Note: Like all dopey politics, 
school boards and Trustees tend to 
put emotion before reason.)
To strike fear back into the 
hearts of Wash U, Chicago, and 
Rochester, it is nearly imperative 
that the Tartans finish 2-1 against 
those three clubs. The future home 
of the Tartans would be slightly 
dubious and recruiting wars 
would swing. CMU would be well 
on its way to looking like Case.
 Then upon whose shoulders 
should all this aggrandized pres
sure rest? Since we are in 
Pittsburgh, it is quite appropriate 
that the key to success or regress is 
the quarterback. Last season, the 
Tartans excelled with then-junior 
Eric Zimpfer under center.
See FEAR, page A9
Panthers coach names Weinke starter
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  
Carolina Panthers coach George 
Seifert has said throughout the 
preseason that his team does not 
have a quarterback controversy.
It does now.
Chris Weinke, last years 
Heisman Trophy winner, began 
working with the first-team 
offense Saturday, just two days 
after Jeff Lewis struggled against 
the Baltimore Ravens.
Seifert said Weinke will start 
against the Cleveland Browns in 
the Panthers preseason finale 
Friday, but wouldnt name a 
starter for the season opener 
against the Minnesota Vikings on 
Sept. 9.
Hes going to start this next 
game, Seifert said. But I cant 
really go beyond that right now, 
because I dont know. I couldnt7put anything in cement, so to
speak.
Lewis had been the starter in 
the preseason, but was 15-for-27 
for 115 yards with four intercep
tions in three games. He was just 
6-of-ll for 19 yards and had three 
interceptions in a span of four 
passes in a 20-17 victory over the 
Ravens Thursday night.
Weinke has hit 30-of-54 passes 
for 350 yards and a touchdown in 
the preseason. The 29-year-old 
rookie was 15-for-25 for 190 
yards against the Ravens and led 
three scoring drives in the second 
half as the Panthers rallied from a 
17-0 deficit.
Weinke has led Carolina to 
three touchdowns and three field 
goals in 13 drives during the pre
season while Lewis has produced 
just one touchdown in 18 series.
Obviously Im very excited, but 
lets not forget I still have a long
way to go, said Weinke, the 
Panthers fourth-round draft 
choice out of Florida State.
Theres still a lot of things for 
me to learn and I need to keep 
improving on things. But its what
I came here for. I want to be a 
starter in the NFL.
The news was difficult for 
Lewis, who had been the 
Panthers projected starter since 
Steve Beuerlein was released dur
ing the off-season.
Sometimes life doesnt go the 
way you want it, Lewis said. I 
think Im harder on myself than 
anybody else is. I have no prob
lem saying how it is. I made some 
mistakes. Im going to try to get 
better, learn from them. One 
thing I need to do is quit beating 
up myself, because I get that 
enough as it is.
Tartan football: a look at the new season
The womens soccer team trains in preparation for what they hope will be a more rewarding season than the last.
by Christopher Chung
Contributing Editor
For Heather Kendra, this coming 
fall season holds a bundle of oppor
tunities for her varsity womens 
soccer team to finally break 
through and become a force in its 
conference, and, in turn, compile a 
dominating record.
The teams frustrating 6-12 
count last year (0-7 in the 
University Athletic Association) is 
motivation now for a Tartan squad 
which is returning its core players 
from last season, including senior 
captain defenders Katie Snell and 
Melanie Stawartz, a midfield with 
junior Melissa McMorrow and 
sophomore Merry McConnochie, 
and a frontline including junior 
I Allison Styer and sophomore Allie 
I Muehe. The Tartan women have 
I also since gained a solid incoming 
I first-year group of players, but 
I Kendra is looking for the veterans 
I to galvanize this season, especially 
I the two captains.
5 Were looking for huge leader
ship from them, said Kendra. 
I Theyve busted their butts for four
years for me now.
The core returning players, 
mixed in with strong newcomers, 
has elevated the overall ability of 
the team, according to Kendra. 
Many of the problems that charac
terized last years team, such as a 
general inability to finish strong at 
the end of games, likely wont be 
issues with the 2001 squad.
The level of this years team is 
high enough that we can play more 
sophisticated, said Kendra, refer
ring to the Tartans new adaptabili
ty in the midfield (switching 
between three-midfielder and fourmidfielder setups), and their 
increased number of possible plays 
as a result.
Essentially, the team is more 
robust than it has ever been, and 
they have been hard at work. 
According to Kendra, the team has 
been practicing since last Sunday, 
August 19, and preseason training 
has been going very well.
Over half the people coming 
back knew how demanding I would 
be, the systems we would play, 
said Kendra. So there was a lot of 
familiarity.
The team is primed and ready for
its first game at the University of 
Pittsburgh-Greensburg this
Saturday afternoon, and that readi
ness showed in the 4-0 scrimmage 
victory the Tartans had over Carlow 
College last Thursday.
In the longer run, Kendra 
believes that last seasons unbeat
able conference rivals, like Emory 
or Chicago, could easily be this sea
sons losers.
Im confident in the group that 
we have, said Kendra. We can 
compete with everyone on our 
schedule. If we take care of our 
business, we should be okay.
As for the game against PittGreensburg this Saturday, the team 
doesnt know what to expect  
Kendras Tartans have never faced 
the Bobcats. But confidence is all 
around, and the women are on 
course for a quite a ride.
This group has a great deal of 
energy and excitement, said 
Kendra. Its been a wonderful pre
season. They really want to get it 
done. Theyre really motivated and 
talented, so thats a great combina
tion. The coaching staff and I are 
really excited to be working with 
them.

Womens soccer team aims to 
improve over previous season
The Carnegie Mellon Football 
team is coming off of its 26th con
secutive winning campaign. 
Although the Tartans kept their 
streak of winning seasons alive, last 
year could be looked upon as a 
rebuilding year. Hit hard by gradu
ation from their 1999 ECAC cham
pion team, the inexperienced 
Tartans finished 6-4 and 2-2 in the 
University Athletic Association.
The four losses were the most 
since 1988 and only the second 
four-loss season since 1974. The 
Tartans third place finish in the 
UAA was their lowest in its ten year 
affiliation with the conference. The 
low marks were not the result of a 
lack of ability or effort, but rather, a 
function of youth.
CMU featured no fewer than 15 
first time starters at various points 
during last season. Many young
sters were pressed into back-up 
roles usually occupied by upper
classmen. As such, the 2000 season 
was truly a trial by fire. In 2001, the 
Tartans look to build on the lessons 
learned in 2000, reestablish them
selves in the conference they once 
dominated, and return to the upper 
echelon of D-III football.
The outlook for the 2001 Tartans 
is generally optimistic. The opti
mism is based on the fact that the 
squad returns several talented play
ers that either started or saw signif
icant playing time. The offense is 
keyed by the return of starting 
quarterback and captain Eric 
Zimpfer. Zimpfer will be comple
mented by a number of young 
backs.
The running back position may 
be the deepest on the team. While 
led by the duo of Andrew Garrod 
and Ricardo the Spark Clarke, 
Chris Kay, Tony DAddieco, Adam 
Urbanzick, and Jeff Stopler should 
also see playing time. Urbanzick 
provided the goal-line punch for 
CMU, rushing for ten touchdowns
The Tartan squad looks to continue its strong performance on defense. Their first match is this Saturday at home.
last season. Offensive tackles 
Brandon Foth and Roy Thompson 
will lead the way upfront. Co-cap
tain receiver Matt Saneholtz should 
see more passes his way this season 
after three years as the number two 
receiver behind the graduated 
Mike McLaughlin.
On defense, 10 starters return, 
including senior co-captains nose 
guard Brian Lenhart and defensive 
end Mark Reiner. The defensive 
line could be equally as deep as the 
RB position. In addition to Lenhart 
and Reiner, junior Ben Zaroukian 
will enter his third season as a 
starter at defensive end. Juniors 
Brian Smalley, Ron White, and 
Chad McKibben should see sub
stantial playing time in CMUs sixman rotation. Co-captain inside 
linebacker Mike Hubbert will be
counted on to help lessen the loss 
of All-UAA, All-American, AllEverything Nick Zitelli. Zitelli 
capped his career by taking home 
Defensive MVP honors at the Aztec 
Bowl, the Division III All Star game 
played in Mexico.
The outside linebacking corps 
should be deep with the return of 
juniors Frank Adam, Rich 
Gasperini, Mike Jura, and sopho
more Mike Danielson. All four play
ers started games at some point last 
season. The secondary may be 
improved due to addition by sub
traction. Coach Bill Dillon has left 
the program and John Robertson 
moves from coaching the lineback
ers to the defensive backs. The 
return of five starters should make 
play more consistent. Seniors Jason 
Morris, Jacob Nichols and Jared
Winchester will lead a unit that 
includes juniors Joe Manger, Jeff 
Klinefelter, and Ryan McMillen.
Eight Questions for the 
Tartans in 2001
8. Will the tight ends be 
more productive?
Not since the days of Chris 
Barnicle and Aaron Neal have the 
Tartans prominently featured the 
tight end in their passing attack. In 
two years, tight ends Scott Jubeck 
and Brian Vest have combined for 
two touchdowns, one coming via a 
fumble recovery. The tight end is a 
critical position in the Wing-T 
offense. Without the tight end, the 
Tartans will become one-dimen
sional and predictable.

Not a Theme Show & Artist of the Year

completely lined a wall in 
another room of the gallery in a 
piece titled Ancient History. 
The notion that even such 
somber art can be educational is 
curious and novel.
Even more curious was 
Brooklyn sculptor Rob de Mars 
Somewhere, a tall tree-like 
sculpture with islands of trees 
and waterfalls connecting high
er and lower branches, inter
spersed with parking lots and 
paved roads which illustrate the 
complexity of a desire to escape: 
nature's ready and waiting, but 
the rest of the world won't be 
still. Aside from any message, 
though, the steel, plywood, 
flocking, and stone sculpture 
calls out to be touched and 
admired solely for its intricacy 
and detail.
The Artist of the Year 2001 
show celebrated computer 
graphics artist Paul Glabicki. 
The main featured piece was 
Full Moon, a 41 minute dual
screen computer animation 
that, while it was carefully 
done, and obviously required a 
lot of work, just wasnt particu
larly interesting. Slightly eerie, 
tense music, and a tunnel of 
stars and constellations that 
broke up into layer upon layer of 
spinning stars wasnt quite 
enough. The artists description 
of the piece, however, grounded 
the idea somewhat: he began 
the project after seeing a 1895 
stereogram of the moon, aged 
in a yellowish sepia, but still 
rendered a convincing 3-D illu
sion. Full Moon is apparently 
a modern attempt to recreate 
the moon as seen now, rather 
than as seen a hundred years 
ago  the sort of thing that is 
called art, but reluctantly.
Several other shorter ani
mations toyed with reflec
tive and transparent panels, 
and lines and shapes that 
built themselves. All of the
works are masterful and evi
dence Glabickis talent, but 
lack the intensity of the 
other exhibits.
The most compelling and 
living, breathing piece in the 
gallery was an installation by 
Rick Gribenas, which is not 
part of either show, and is still 
available for viewing. Entitled 
I/O jhg piece consists of 
approximately 50 fluorescent 
lights, hung from the ceiling 
to waist height, and three 
chairs with headphones con
nected to a stereo randomly 
playing 400 audio clips. The 
chairs vibrate slightly and 
contribute to the tension cre
ated by how short each clip is, 
and how random they are. The 
headphones spit out dischordant fragments like this, one 
after another:
dont know why I go shop
ping every day. I buy soooo 
much stuff.

until your shoulder muscles[heavy breathing]
[high pitched beeps] 
everything he did seemed 
rooted in his career
[radio tuning]
and they will repay you a 
thousand-fold 
to the point of exhaustion. 
Listeners are made to want to 
follow any of the conversa
tions, even an uninteresting 
one, just to avoid the frustra
tion of hearing bits of all of 
them. The tension is fascinat
ing and worth experiencing.
The Pittsburgh Center for the 
Arts is located on the corner of 
Fifth Avenue and Shady Avenue. 
It is open Monday through 
Saturday from 10 am to 5:30 pm 
and Sunday from 12 pm to 5 pm.

Somewhere by Rob de Mar. A mixed media piece on display at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts exhibit.
Not a theme show? Well then, 
what is it? Pretty darn cool.
This summer, the Pittsburgh 
Center for the Arts hosted two 
shows (which just .closed on 
August 26) concurrently: Not a 
Theme Show, and Artist of the 
Year 2001.
Not a Theme Show was a ter
rifically interesting combina
tion of artists, styles, and 
media. The ten artists fea
tured installations, prints, 
and sculptures complemented 
each other particularly well, 
despite the non-theme-show 
approach, or perhaps because 
of it. The variety was impres
sive and saved the show from 
the all-too-common preten
tiousness of gallery shows.
Even by itself, the wall of 
posters designed by Vaughan 
Oliver encompassed a full range 
of styles. Rather than imposing 
his personal style upon the 
bands for whom he designed 
posters (including the Pixies, 
the Breeders, Throwing Muses, 
Dead Can Dance, and Red 
House Painters) he adapted it to 
a mood befitting the various 
genres.
In fact, mood was a notice
able aspect to each part of the 
show; each piece felt evoca
tive rather then simply 
descriptive. A dim room full of 
several dozen dim light bulbs, 
piles of electrical cords, and 
metal plates and spikes for 
building a railroad were the 
main components of Jin Soo 
Kims tracks. The accompa
nying audio of the sounds of 
railroad workers added sin
cerity to the calm room.

Variety of exhibits occupy art museum
by Beth Powell
Arts & Living Editor
The Carnegie Museum of Art, 
located at 4400 Forbes Avenue 
(which is at the corner of Forbes 
and South Craig for those who 
dont know), is planning a variety 
of exhibitions for the Fall 
2001/Spring 2002 season.
Right now the museum has

Augustus Charles Pugin, Sir 
John Soane, and Joseph Gandy. 
It ends on September 2.
The museum also has Still 
Rooms & Excavations: A

memorial in California. The 
museums Forum Gallery is 
showing Forum: National
Society of Arts and Letters Small 
Sculpture Exhibition through 
September 2. The exhibit fea

works were chosen by a jury in 
an exhibition that was hosted 
by the National Society of Arts 
and Letters.
Portrait/Self-Portrait: Prints 
and Drawings from the Museums 
Collections will be on display 
through November 25 in the 
Works on Paper Gallery. The 
works cover a time period from 
the Renaissance through the

European artists, such as 
Rembrandt, Degas, Picasso, and 
Matisse, as well as American
artists including Winslow 
Homer, John James Audubon, 
and Pittsburgh painter David 
Gilmour Blythe.
And if all thats not enough to 
keep you busy at the museum for 
awhile, then you can wander 
down to the Treasure Room to 
see Whats In Your Tureen: Soup, 
Stew, or Ragot?, where decora
tive and culinary arts meet. Ten 
tureens from many different 
time periods are matched with 
the food that they might have 
been used for.
The juried 2001 exhibition, 
Associated Artists of Pittsburgh 
91st Annual Exhibition, is 
judged by David Carrier, a 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Philosophy Professor. Artists liv
ing within 150 miles of the city 
are invited to submit their work. 
The works will be on display in 
the Heinz Galleries through 
September 23.
After the above exhibits are 
over, prepare for another round 
starting September 15. Forum: 
Diane Samuels  Inscription 
will open in the Forum Gallery. 
Samuels work combines video 
and sound recordings with 
handmade objects to chronicle 
the stories of Norma Permutter 
and Otmar Gotterbarm. This 
exhibit will run through 
February 24, 2002. The Heinz 
Architectural Center will also 
open Perfect Acts of Architecture. 
The exhibit includes more than 
140 drawings and collages 
based on the architectural med
itations of Rem Koolhaas, Peter 
Eisenman, Daniel Libeskind, 
and more. The exhibit closes on 
January 6, 2002.
Dream Street: W. Eugene
Smiths Pittsburgh Photographs 
opens on November 3. Smith is 
known as one of the most impor

due to his work for LIFE maga
zine and more. He spent over a 
year in Pittsburgh, taking over 
13,000 pictures of the city in 
1955. This exhibition is the first 
of the 200 photographs that
Smith chose from that work.
Neapolitan Prespio can be 
seen November 30 through 
January 6, 2002 in the Hall of 
Architecture. In this exhibit, 
the Nativity is recreated

Psirus, Tau Delta Phis mascot, passed away from internal injuries after 
being hit by a car. Although Psirus was one of CMUs best known person
alities and outstanding students, the Tau Delts were not permitted to put 
up a monument on campus in his memory because that is not even the 
policy followed for dead presidents.
25 years ago  Housing had to accomodate more than 2154 stu
dents, 350 more than the previous year. Students were placed in various 
places around campus, including fraternity houses, and lounges in E 
Tower of Morewood Gardens.
Professor Delbert Highlands was forced to resign as Head of the 
Architecture Department at the request of the Dean of the College of Fine 
Arts, Akram Midani.
: The incoming Class of 1980 numbered 1,100. Overall this enrollment 
number was down by a very small amount from the previous year.
2 10 years ago  A new online card catalog system was introduced by 
University Libraries, known as The Library Information System II (LIS II). 
It was an improvement in speed and power over LIS I.
CMU launched the Student Mentor Program with approximately 130
mentor-student pairs. The program is designed to help incoming students 
adjust to life at CMU. First-year students were matched with juniors and 
seniors having their same majors and interests.
Ten out of 14 fraternity houses were robbed over the summer. Items 
including Delta Tau Deltas mixing board, amplifier, and speakers for the 
house sound system, Sigma Alpha Epsilons house TV, CD player, and tape 
deck, and personal items from fraternity brothers in many of the houses 
were stolen.
The Tartan womens soccer team began its first varsity season. Formerly 
a club team, the women took on a full varsity schedule and planned to 
work its way into the proper University Athletic Association schedule over 
the next two years.
The Tartan football team was picked to win the University Athletic 
Association title after posting a perfect 10-0 record the previous year.
CMU police arrested three CMU students on charges of burglary of the 
schools ID machine. Police noticed the students carrying away boxes con
taining blank photo ID cards. Upon investigation, it was discovered that 
one of the boxes contained the photo ID camera.
5 years ago  The University Center opened officially. The fes
tivities included bands, banners, and bagpipes. CMU President 
Robert Mehrabian said, The opening of the University Center was
truly an historic occasion for Carnegie Mellon. Until now, the 
University had never had a central community center that serves all 
the members of the Carnegie Mellon family  students, faculty, staff 
and alumni.
Dr. Paul Fowler took over as associate dean of Student Affairs and direc
tor of Student Life.
CMUs Andrew Consortium released the first version of its Andrew

Science & Technology Editor
Move over, Brazil. 50 years down the line, 
researchers in artificial intelligence and robot
ics hope to have a team of fully functional, 
autonomous humanoid robots defeat the 
human world soccer champions. Lofty ambi
tions? Perhaps not. For now, though, 
researchers are content with having robots 
compete against one another on ping-pong 
table sized arenas using a considerably smaller 
ball.
RoboCup 2001, the fifth iteration of the tour
nament, was held at the Washington State 
Convention and Trade Center in Seattle from 
August 2 to August 10, in conjunction with the 
International Joint Conference on Artificial 
Intelligence. The conference included sympo
siums, lectures, and tutorials from experts on 
artificial intelligence. Microsoft Chairman Bill 
Gates delivered the keynote address during the 
event. Official sponsors for RoboCup 2001 
included Carnegie Mellon Universitys very own 
School of Computer Science, and the American 
Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). 
Sony and SGI served as the worldwide spon
sors.
Categories within the competition included 
Simulation Soccer League, Small-Sized Soccer 
Robot League, Middle-Sized Soccer Robot 
League, Sony Four-Legged Robot League and 
the RoboCup Rescue Simulation. The Simulator 
League pitted autonomous software players 
using artificial intelligence programs in realistic 
simulations against each other, while elemen
tary and secondary school students participat
ed with small custom-built robots in the 
RoboCup Junior event. The simulations had ref
erees in place to ensure that neither team cheat
ed.
In order for a robot team to actually perform 
a soccer game, various technologies must be 
incorporated including: design principles of 
autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, 
strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robot
ics, and sensor-fusion. RoboCup is a task for a 
team of multiple fast-moving robots under a 
dynamic environment. The RoboCup organisa
tion also offers a software platform for research 
on the software aspects of the competition.
The School of Computer Science was well 
represented in the organization of the event 
itself, with Manuela Veloso, associate professor 
of computer science serving as the general 
chair, and Tucker Balch, a research scientist 
with the Robotics Institute, serving as associate 
chair for robotics events. Additionally, Peter 
Stone of AT&T Research was the associate chair 
for the simulation events.
Carnegie Mellons team, CM Pack 01, placed 
second in the Sony Legged Robot League, and 
also proved to be the only American team to 
place either first or second in any of the events. 
Despite losing to the University of New South 
Wales 9-2 in the championship final, the team 
proved to be quite successful in the league 
stage, defeating teams from Sweden, Tokyo and 
Kyushu. Carnegie Mellons teams in the Small, 
Middle-Sized and the Simulation Leagues were 
eliminated in the round-robin stage of the com
petition. Teams produced vsatly different 
designs for their team of robots, ranging from 
on-board laptops to ingenious wide-angle lens
es on off-the-shelf cameras on board the robots.
The competition had a rich international fla
vor, including teams from Italy, Australia, 
Germany, France, Bulgaria, China, and the 
United Kingdom. Among other results in the 
competition, Ngee Ann Polytech from 
Singapore defeated Singapore Polytechnic in 
the Small-Sized Robot League finals, and 
Tsinghua University from China got past the 
University of Karlsruhe of Germany 1-0 in the 
Simulator League finals. The University of 
Freiburg defeated the team from Osaka 
University 1-0 in the final of the Middle-Sized 
Robot League. In all, RoboCup 2001 attracted 
more than 100 entrants from 23 countries, a 
record number.
Researchers in robotics and AI hope to accel
erate progress in their fields with the emer
gence of such events, especially by introducing
elements of collaboration and competition into 
their work. Robot soccer, trivial as it may seem, 
provides an ideal arena for the testing and 
demonstration of new developments in the 
field. Many researchers take part because build
ing robots to play soccer means they must tack
le real-world problems, refine sensors, and find 
better ways for groups of robots to work 
towards a common goal. The competition was 
started by Sony visionary Hiroaki Kitano and 
soccer was chosen because a meaningful and 
sometimes exciting game can be played even if 
the ball never leaves the ground. So far, robots 
are content to kick the ball around rather than 
chip it into the back of the net or attempt to 
head it past the keeper. Even so, training robots 
to play soccer is a definite first step towards 
building search and rescue robots capable of 
saving the lives of disaster victims. According to 
Kitano, the robots must coordinate efforts, nav
igate obstacles and react quickly during soccer, 
all of which would be essential in a rescue oper
ation.
Robots in Japan already provide interactive 
companionship for hospitalized children and 
walk frail elderly people down hallways, says 
Bob Bishop, chairman and chief executive offi
cer of Mountain View, California-based SGI, 
formerly Silicon Graphics. One day, they will be 
able to help fetch food and medications for the 
elderly, perform physical therapy on them, and 
guide them down stairs, he says. Bishop went 
on to comment that people could already do 
these things, but in the near future, human 
assistants could be difficult to find and employ. 
Bishop envisions a future shift from artificial 
intelligence to artificial consciousness, and 
then finally, artificial emotion.
Though robot soccer might seem extremely 
crude to the observer, it is impressive that the 
robots play soccer at all. Fukuoka, Japan will 
host the 2002 RoboCup tournament. Candidate 
cities for the 2003 event include Padova, Italy, 
Acapulco, Mexico and Linz, Austria. Previous 
editions of the tournament have been held in 
Nagoya, Japan, Paris, France, Melbourne, 
Australia and Stockholm, Sweden.
Department of Chemistrys IrYdium Project builds 
bridges between lecture material and homework
by Sriram Vaidhyanathan

ScSt Tools VBvy Help_
Many high school and college students are often terribly put off 
by the prospect of approaching their chemistry homework, espe
cially with the recipe approach and the lab exercises most uni
versities use. The IrYdium Project at the Department of Chemistry 
here at Carnegie Mellon, headed by Dr. David Yaron, aims to 
change the mode of thought for first-year chemistry programs 
nationwide.
Instead of replacing hands-on lab activities, the project hopes to 
build bridges between lecture material and actual laboratory work 
by converting concepts into tools for solving problems.
The IrYdium Project has now produced a series of applets on the 
Web which allow the students to satisfy their scientific curiosity in 
a constructive manner. While allowing students to approach their 
assignments and experiments in a different manner, it cultivates 
an interest in observing real world applications of key concepts 
covered in the classroom. Network Computing and Remote 
Database Technology allows the software to be ported over the 
web on Java applets. The Virtual Laboratory applet itself is gen
eral and flexible, while some of the projects several special topic 
applets include Acclimatization on Mt. Everest, 
Stoichiometry, The Internal Combustion Engine Simulator,
Why Things Have Color, Equilibrium, and the Statistical Mechanical 
Simulator. One of the other applets is Mission to Mars, where teams of 
students collaborate to measure heats of reaction for different fuels in 
order to launch a virtual rocket to Mars. A good number of the applets up 
on the Web site, http://ir.chem.cmu.edu, are designed to be lecture tools, 
while others are intended for use as homework supplements.
The ultimate goal of the IrYdium Project is to impact scientific education 
across the country, helping students become more interested in chemistry 
and providing faculty with better educational tools. Theoretically, when 
students are more intrigued by their coursework, theyre less likely to 
switch majors. Yarons team is gathering data to investigate this impact on 
retention.
Led by Dr. David Yaron and head programmer Donovan Lange, the fouryear-old projects current group members are educational consultant Rea 
Freeland, and programmers and writers Donovan Lange, Mike Karabinos, 
Jeff Milton, Giancarlo Dozzi, and Emma Rehm. Current sponsors of the

Researchers work on new ver
sion of Genome Project
Professor of Materials Science and Engineering 
Gregory Rohrer and other researchers are work
ing on the materials research equivalent of the 
human genome project. Similar to recent efforts 
of researchers trying to spell out the nucleotides 
that make up the DNA on all human chromo
somes, Rohrer is trying to map out the best prop
erties available to make airplanes stronger and 
nuclear power plants safer.
The goal of his research is to understand the 
strengths and weaknesses of materials that 
make up everything from a car battery to a 
supersonic jet. These materials, used in applica
tions ranging from planes and trains to integrat
ed circuits, are polycrystallines. They are made 
up of large numbers of microscopic crystals con
nected to each other by interfaces called grain
boundaries. The properties of these boundaries 
determine how materials perform, including 
how long they will last or how they will break. 
Rohrers research is being conducted at 
Carnegie Mellons CIT in the Materials Research 
and Science and Engineering Center, which 
recently received a $4.3 million grant from the 
National Science Foundation.

Stanford aquaculture research in progress
(U-WIRE, Stanford, California.) 
What do salmon in the Atlantic, 
shrimp in Hong Kong and carp in 
Finland have in common? Their 
decline in numbers - often blamed 
on pollution - is the result of over
fishing, according to scientists.
In the 1950s, aquaculture was 
hailed as a solution to two prob
lems: satisfying increasing food 
demand and not depleting the 
oceans natural resources. Fish 
would be raised and harvested in 
large numbers at optimal condi
tions without harming their respec
tive ecosystems.
In the past decade, a consensus 
has emerged in the scientific com
munity that over-fishing has creat
ed more problems than it has 
solved. Despite attempts to manage 
populations, commercial fishing 
creates imbalance in ecosystems.
The American Association for the 
Advancement of Science holds an 
annual conference on fishing every 
February. The last meeting, held in 
San Francisco, ended with a joint 
statement calling for sustainable 
fishing to help the world create a 
new era.
At Stanford University, there are 
several important names in the 
field of fisheries research. 
Rosamond Naylor, a senior fellow 
at the Institute for International 
Studies, has actively called for
adoption of more ecologically 
sound management practices.: 
Joshua Eagle, coordinator of the 
Stanford Fisheries Project at the 
Law School, is currently directing a 
worldwide effort to influence 
national policies. Barbara Block, an 
associate professor in marine sci
ences, has established the Tuna 
Research and Conservation Center 
to support research on tuna and 
bluefish stock in the Atlantic.
Fisheries alter marine ecosys
tems directly, by removing a large 
fraction of the biomass of coastal 
and offshore resources at all higher 
trophic levels. Trophic levels are 
the segments of the food chain: 
Plant-eating fish, for instance, sub
sist at a lower trophic level than 
meat-eating fish.
In addition, fisheries have indi
rect effects by altering the food sup
ply of the remaining marine preda
tors and by damaging bottom habi
tats.
Aquaculture is not just farming 
fish, said Meryl Williams, the 
director of ICLARM - The World 
Fishing Cejiter ~fn Malaysia. It 
involvesa wide range of changes  
economic, social, perhaps even 
political - in human communities. 
The center conducts sustainable 
fishing projects worldwide.
According 
to Williams, See AQUA, Page B6
page article that ran in the August 10th edition. 
It covers several aspects of the debate, including 
limiting scholarship to accommodate copyright 
owners, fair use of copyrighted material, and 
the First Amendment as a defense by opponents 
of the Digital Copyright Act.
Linux celebrates 10th birthday
The jury is out on whether anyone, or anything, 
has achieved more in 10 years than the open 
source OS Linux has. It was 10 years ago when 
Finn Linus Torvalds wrote Linux while studying at 
the University of Helsinki.
Linuxs portability is a huge benefit to organi
zations more used to the bewildering world of 
MS Windows. Experts feel that the 10-year old 
Linux operating system has already raised the 
levels of security and reliability people have 
come to expect from software.

Stanford lead the way in aquaculture
From AQUA, Page B5
aquaculture has responded well to 
increasing demand for fish supply, 
but has created new problems for 
humanity. Block stated two of 
these challenges: international 
policy and lack of knowledge.
Tunas are highly migratory 
species and their large-scale 
movement brings them to many 
countries, Block said. 
Effectively, they are fish without 
a country. This makes [it] a chal
lenge to manage them. According 
to Block, the second challenge is 
not knowing enough about tuna 
populations and their behaviors. 
Block's lab will be publishing a 
paper in Science that will give a 
whole new perspective to this 
issue.
In Naylor's view, the main 
problem is our continued depen
dence on the use of fish.
Habitat modification, intro
duction of non-indigenous organ
isms, disruption of food web inter
actions and disposal of chemicals 
are other major concerns, Naylor 
said. She outlined these issues in a 
paper published last June in 
Nature.
In developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia, increased 
food production has dramatically 
reduced starvation. In India and 
Africa, they are an important 
source of income. Even developed 
countries - where other sources of 
food are abundant - are heavily 
dependent on commercial fishing. 
Indeed, 90 percent of all harvest
ed fish ends up on the plate of 
European, American or Japanese 
households.
The problem of overfishing has 
intensified since production has 
surged, particularly during the 
past 10 to 15 years. Farmed fish 
supplies totaled 29 megatons in 
1997, compared with 10 megatons 
a decade ago.
The human population is soar
ing beyond six billion, Block said. 
In the case of tuna, it is unclear if 
the fish can handle this growing 
demand.
For instance, about 80 percent 
of carp and 65 percent of tilapia 
worldwide are farmed without 
the use of modern compound 
feeds - feeds formulated from 
multiple ingredients. In China, 
farmed production of carp and 
other omnivorous species is inten
sifying and new commercial feeds 
mills are being developed to serve
these industries.
Another possibility is to reduce 
fish meal and fish oil inputs in 
feed. Research to develop substi
tutes has been progressing but the 
established aquaculture industry 
is a great barrier to their greater 
use.
The ultimate solution is an envi
ronmentally friendly manage
ment of resources. This would 
require long-term practices such 
as regulating ponds and man
groves, and a radical change in 
consumption. patterns.
Development banks are key agen
cies to help poorer countries 
implement new methods.
Eagle, who spearheads changes 
in international policy, is working 
to defend the "application of sci
entific methods to the manage
ment of fish." For Naylor, smallscale actions such as consumer 
awareness are extremely impor
tant for change. According to 
Naylor, "if public and private 
interests act jointly to reduce 
external costs generated by farm
ing systems, present trends may 
be reversed and the contribution 
of aquaculture to global fish sup
plies can become increasingly pos
itive."

Silent Bob draws references to Smiths earlier movies
MOVIE REVIEW
by Greg Nofi
Contributing Editor
Anything new, Greg?
Yeah, mom, I have to go review a movie 
tonight.
Which movie?
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
Cool! Snoogie, woogies, son!
Yeah, right. I dont even think I told her what 
movie I was going to see during that phone call. 
If so, every time she would see a commercial for 
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, I would get an 
email from her full of unadulterated horror and 
confusion as to why anyone would go see this 
movie. She would never enjoy this film. Its just 
that simple. Nonetheless, its just as simple as 
identifying those who would enjoy this movie. 
Ill get to that in a bit. But first, here comes the 
obligatory synopsis.
Jay and Silent Bob is the latest View Askew 
production from director/writer/Jersey boy 
Kevin Smith, and from the surface the film is a 
mishmash of dick and fart jokes. Jay Phat Buds 
(Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) are the 
inspiration for comic book heroes Bluntman and 
Chonic. Thats about the only inspiration they

comes to a crashing end when they receive a

Last week researchers in India 
announced that they developed a 
computer that can fool people into 
believing it is a child. The scien
tists hope that within 10 years the 
computer, named Hal after the 
computer from Stanley Kubricks 
2001: A Space Odyssey, will be 
able to hold an adult level conver
sation.
Although the artificial intelli
gence field is still fairly new, the 
scenario depicted in Stanley 
Kubricks latest and final movie 
may actually be nearer than it 
seems. A.I. was Kubricks pet pro
ject but after his death in 1999,
Steven Spielberg took over the 
project and brought it to life in 
theaters this past July. The story 
begins with a thought-provoking 
discussion of artificial intelligence 
and raises the question: if a mecha 
(the movies word for a mechani
cal human) can love, does the 
owner have a responsibility to rec
iprocate that love?
The movie takes place in the 
future after the Earths ice caps 
have melted, leaving New York 
City and other major coastal areas 
submerged under water. Mecha 
are commonplace in society and 
fulfill roles as servants and socalled pleasure models.

Kidman delivers masterful performance in thriller
MOVIE REVIEW

laley Joel Osmond stars in summer blockbuster Artificai Intelligence.
by Michael Gibbons
Junior Staffwriter
The Others is one of those rare 
thriller/horror movies that goes 
for understating rather than over
stating the suspense, and the end 
result is very effective. An enjoy
able movie with great old-fash
ioned conventions (which avoid 
playing as tired cliches), Nicole 
Kidman gives an absolutely aston
ishing performance as a repressed 
mother, Grace, at the end of her 
rope. The Others is set immediate
ly after World War II on the 
recently occupied Isle of Jersey. 
The monstrous house that Grace 
and her children occupy is their 
entire world, trapping them in a 
cavernous and dark place.
The premise of The Others is rel
atively simple: Graces husband is 
missing from the war, and her two 
children suffer from severe photo
sensitivity (i.e. anything beyond 
the dimmest light can be fatal). 
For this reason, no door can be 
opened without the previous one 
first being closed. The house is 
full of mysterious presences, how
ever, and they slowly but surely 
corrode Graces control of the sit
uation. To share anything more 
would take away from the sus
pense of the movie, but The Others 
is full of fun twists and turns that 
are characteristic of Spanish 
director Alejandro Amenabars 
movies.
Atmospheric and unsettling, 
The Others is long and methodical, 
and there are plenty of menacing 
moments before the real suspense
begins. While the deliberately 
slow pace may feel tedious, the 
resolution of the movie rewards 
the viewers patience. The direct
ing is subtle but perfect for the 
gloomy and gothic feel of the 
movie. Any director who can 
direct a horror movie these days 
without succumbing to cheap spe
cial effects or psych! scare tactics 
is a creative novelty, anyway. 
Nicole Kidman complements the 
tone of the movie completely. 
Without a strong actress to take 
the lead, the movie and its plot 
could come off as a laughable fail
ure, but Kidman plays Grace with 
the utmost sincerity. The support
ing cast is strong as well, most 
notably with Fionnula Flanagan 
who plays the mysterious new ser
vant Mrs. Mills.
While there are lot of familiar 
references, in plot and style to 
other movies, The Others is enjoy
able on many levels. The movie 
opens with Grace violently 
screaming from a disturbing 
nightmare, but no mention is 
made of the nightmare during the 
course of the movie. Grace uses 
religion to perpetuate her denial 
of whats really happening in her 
house. Her stubborn daughter 
Anne, who never really believed 
her mothers religious teachings, 
provides an interesting conflict 
that forces Grace to open her eyes. 
Amenabar treats his audience 
intelligently and provides them 
with a lot to think about, deliver
ing a movie that is distinct, origi
nal, and well worth seeing.
FINAL GRADE: Aimmy Eat World reaches a new level of popularity
CD REVIEW
Emma Rehm
'o-Copy Manager
Known and loved by the emo 
Icenesters for years, Arizonas 
Jimmy Eat World has reached a 
jinnacle of popularity with the 
ilease of their new album. After 
imaining quietly underground 
/ith Capitol Records since 1995, 
le band was dropped by their 
ibel (an unwise decision, Capitol 
lust be realizing now). After that, 
hey independently recorded Bleed 
\merican, a solid album which 
Reared the band to DreamWorks 
id wound up getting them a new 
pcord deal. Bleed American was 
pleased barely a month ago, on 
lly 24 and even before then, its 
le track was getting airplay on 
[iveral major radio stations, and 
?w theres even a video for it on 
J2. The best part: theyve made 
I theyre huge now  without 
jer being shunned by the scene for 
jelling out because theyd already 
fade the album before signing 
/ay their souls to DreamWorks. 
|The progression of Jimmy Eat 
lorlds career is of course not just 
Tident in their popularity. Their 
[evious release, Clarity, was a 
ich harder sounding collection of
songs. Their young and original 
sound has since matured into a 
slightly older, more rehearsed, and 
certainly (perhaps disappointingly) 
more mainstream whole.
Even the style of the album itself

Bleed American  the title track 
and first song on the album  is a 
crunchy, turn-it-up-as-loud-as-itgoes track, which lead singer Jim 
Adkins says describes a feeling 
that somethings missing. With 
lyrics like Im not alone because 
the tvs on/ I'm not crazy because I 
take the right pills every day and
rest, the song opens the album 
with fierce energy and on a melan
choly note. This slightly mopey feel 
continues through all of the songs, 
though later in the album that 
energy is in the lyrics rather than 
sustained in the music.
The album gains a sort of Goo

The album recovers from the 
syrup, though, with a few rather 
bitter tracks (If You Dont, Dont

the first tracks. Get it Faster (the 
best song on the album, deter

Dancer in the Dark
Thursday, August 30
This film stars singer/songwriter/actress Bjork and is directed by the 
award-winning Lars von Trier. Selma (Bjork) is a Czech immigrant, a 
single mother working in a factory in rural America. Her salvation is her 
passion for music, specifically, the all-singing, all-dancing numbers 
found in classic Hollywood musicals. This is what the official Web site 
for the movie says its about.
All I know is that I was watching an awards show one time and Bjork 
was supposed to perform. When she came out to sing, she was wearing 
this crazy dress. She just had on a normal shirt, but then the skirt was all 
swan feathers and then the neck of the swan and the head wrapped 
around her and up over her shoulder or something like that. So now, 
even though this movie may be a masterful drama, everytime I see Bjork, 
I think of the ugly swan dress.

Enemy of the Gate
Friday, August 31
No, no, no. This movie does not star Will Smith and it isnt about 
government surveillance and the secret monitoring of phone calls. 
Were talking about Gates, not States.
Enemy of the Gate, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, tells the tale of 
two WWII snipers during the battle of Stalingrad between the Russian 
and German armies. Jude Law plays Vasily, a young Russian peasant 
who becomes a heroic symbol to his people and a German officer (Ed 
Harris) sent out on a special mission to kill him, and in the process, 
lower Russian morale. Joseph Fiennes is Danilov, the army 
officer/journalist who publishes accounts of Vasiliys heroics to the 
masses.
Yea, so if you havent guessed I havent seen this movie, but I did 
actually do some research. I searched for it on Google.com, and 
although I didnt think it sounded like too bad of a movie, I found a 
Web site that pretty much thought it was worthless. Enemy of the Gate 
is the surprise comedy hit of the new year! You will laugh your ass 
off!
They went as far as to call the ending scenes the most laughable 
plot and dialogue since Michael Douglas carried Melanie Griffith 
across the border in Shining Through a few years back. Ouch.

Saturday, September 1
Due to a change in authorship, Brad will now take over the movie 
reviews.
Thanks, Sara. I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this intel
lectually stimulating discussion on McConomy Movies. How may decent 
movies have you heard of that disclose ones ethnicity in the title? Its an 
interesting topic that demands further discussion. Roger Eberts Movie 
Home Companion, 1989 edition, lists The Bostonians, The Dead, and Valley 
Girl. If you cannot distinguish the 1989 from the 1990 edition, the 1989 
edition sports a snapshot of Roger on the front. He looks real homey with 
his vest/sportcoat outfit and the bug-eyed glasses. Oh, and his thumb is 
cocked upwards and ready for sittin. That lends itself to more dialogue. 
What does Roger Ebert do for fun? He cant possibly want to go to the 
movies. My guess is strip club. He gets extremely drunk and chases the 
truck drivers with a broken bottle and shouts mindless dribble about the 
1936 Academy Awards and the blacklisting of Hollywood during the 
1950s.
Its tough to argue that any of the aboved-mentioned films would clar
ify ones roots, but the list pretty much explains where we are headed 
with obscure ethnic-mentions in movie titles. And if you think you can 
find an ethnic-titled movie, forward it along to Rog.
I might add that only The Bostonians received an Academy Award of 
any importance. Vanessa Redgrave took home the Oscar for Best Actress 
in a Leading Role.
If you came looking for insider knowledge, ask AB. Im sure they enjoy 
explaining their movie choices to the paying public. Thats why they post 
those zany movie pictures.

Bill & Teds Bogus Journey
Sunday, September 2
The only thing bogus about this movie is that AB is charging a dollar! 
They should probably consider billing the moviegoer two dollars for this 
flick! If you just cant get enough of these two excellent characters, give 
AB two dollars for your enjoyment. Then send me five dollars and I will 
guarantee you a way to make money... and its perfectly legal!
Speaking of bogus, there is something eating at my brain. Its known by 
all learned folk that history repeats itself. Its a fact. Spend several hours 
glancing over the archives of The Tartan. To be blunt, every few years a 
CMU student passes away, a student government official has some legal 
troubles, and someone tries to or does censor The Tartan. With that bit of 
Carnegie Mellon data passed along, consider trends in all-male pop 
groups. In the 1950s, Doo-Wop tore up the charts. Crazy guys singing in 
really high voices. And many of them were named something real catchy, 
like Richie and Funmakers. Today, male pop bands, or boy bands as 
some radio head so candidly put it, sing in really high pitches about the 
same garbage. Starry-eyed love, girls, and unwholesome fun. Todays 
rock groups illustrate their tremendous ingenuity with alpha-numeric 
monikers. SevenMaryThree. Sum41. Matchbox 20. Ben Folds Five. 
Blinkl82. 98 Degrees.
I hope you understand where we are headed, ladies and gentlemen. 
The counter-culture movement is rapidly approaching. Womens rights 
will evolve into Men and Womens Rights. Mind you we have already 
begun to see the effects. A few years ago, Capri pants were all the rage. 
Today, the sassy like to wear bellbottoms. Today platforms. Tomorrow 
nuclear war.
Speaking of crazy coincidences, is anyone concerned that the new 
GSIA dean has the same surname as the former GSIA dean? Creepy.

Ecclectic musical experiences - from Las Vegas to Tulsa - make memorable summer
H
O
by Debra Halpern
Acting Personell Manager
II
Being a 19-year-old native of Pittsburgh, I found 
that my hot summer nights could only be filled with 
three options. 1) Sitting around in the smoke caked 
walls of Eat n Park. 2) Spending eight dollars a night 
on another Hollywood Blockbuster snoozer. 3) 
Spending my cash on some live music. Although I 
ended up doing all three, I would say the music is the 
one to boast about.
My first dive at shows was about three days after 
finals were over; I took a pilgrimage to Las Vegas to 
riel myself of all the Carnegie Mellon stress which 
possessed my body after my freshman experience  I 
call it an experience because that is what it truly was. 
Afjter many failures to leave the hot tub and trying to 
shjmooze my way into a blackjack table (Im very 
underage) I finally made it to my first event, Las 
Vdgas style, an impersonator, Danny Gans. Mr. Gans 
promises an hour and a half of laughter for one hun
dred dollars a ticket, but instead delivered an hour of 
Christian spirituality, MTV culture, and Las Vegas 
greats. What a combo. Overall I would say he did 
well, except for his fifteen minutes of NSync, which I 
cojuld do have done without, and his closing of his 
ov|/n music, a Christian preaching song about loving 
oije another ... or something blah blah blah, love 
Jeisus. Not that I hate Jesus, but I dont need to pay a
hundred dollars to hear about it. Thats what church is for.
My trip concluded with a family dinner at Caesars 
Palaces coffee shop, where we have a history of 
always seeing someone famous and embarrassing the 
crap out of ourselves arguing about it. This year 
proved to be no different. A man who looked like 
Willie Nelson walked in, waving his hands to the 
crowd as they clapped over their steaks. He sat down 
and quickly stood up and sang a Willie Nelson tune in 
the middle of the cafe. My dad wanted me to talk to 
him, while I swore it was no way in hell Willie Nelson. 
After a long debate with my family and the Willie 
Nelson fanatics next to us, I was the chosen one to go 
up to President Carters choice piano player, David 
Osborne, who informed me the man was the great 
Jay Willie, a Willie Nelson impersonator who now 
believes he truly is Willie Nelson, and in fact signs 
autographs Willie. Only in Vegas.
My experiences back home brought me to a wide 
variety of concerts, starting with the New 96.1 Kiss 
FM Monster Bash, where I had a Wyclef  a great 
rapper of our time  experience and witnessed teens 
fall through trash can lids trying to get a better look 
at 98 Degrees. Teeny boppers couldnt beat the sight 
of Aerosmith and their 50-year-old youth, who 
brought out the fantastic metal guitarist Slash to 
complete the package. The only thing to damper that 
evening was Pennsylvanias own Fuel, which as far as 
I know has never delivered a good live performance, 
and I have seen them enough.
Even though Aerosmith was as about rock n roll as
Critic recommends Jay and Silent Bob
SILENT BOB, from page B8 
bbok from artist Holden (Ben 
Affleck) and tracer Banky (Chris 
Lee), plan to begin shooting of a 
movie blockbuster featuring the 
superhero duo. When Holden 
shows them irreverent Internet 
knocks on the real-life Jay and 
Silent Bob posted to a movie Web 
site called Poop Shoot, the scrap
py protagonists get pissed and set 
o|it from Jersey to Hollywood in a 
Wild road trip in an attempt to take 
back control of the movie about 
tlieir alter egos. Along the way, Jay 
nieets the girl of his dreams, Justice 
(Shannon Elizabeth) and dozens of 
others making cameos, including a 
hitchhiking George Carlin, Carrie 
Fisher as a nun, and crack dealing 
Tracy Morgan.
, Anyway, back to the big question: 
Who would enjoy this movie? Well, 
fc?r starters, I enjoyed it. I consider 
njyself a Smith fan, but not a huge 
fanatic. Ive seen and enjoyed all of 
Kevin Smiths previous films, and 
that is the single most important 
reason why I liked this one.
To be honest, I didnt think that 
Jay and Silent Bob would be funny 
enough to fill an entire 90 plus min
utes ofifilm. But Kevin Smith pulled 
it' off, with the help of his unique 
ensemble of personalities and plots 
his has created through the years
with Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, 
and, to a slightly lesser extent, 
Dogma. Even though the characters 
arent terribly bright, Kevin Smith 
has created a surprising smart 
movie chock full of witty pop cul
ture references. While some of the 
obvious, idiot-proof references can 
be annoying, its the subtle refer
ences and Smiths attention to 
detail that makes this movie funny. 
For example, about halfway 
through the film, I realized that Jay 
is wearing a Bezerker t-shirt for 
almost the entire film. (Bezerker 
was a brief song sung in Clerks by 
Jays friend, Olaf the Russian metalhead.) In another scene, someone 
referred to Bluntman and Chronic 
as Bill and Ted meets Cheech and 
Chong, an analogy used in the 
beginning of Chasing Amy. Had I 
not seen Chasing Amy again recent
ly, I wouldve totally missed that. In 
fact, Im sure I didnt even recog
nize many other allusions to previ
ous Smith works. You know youve 
missed something because you 
hear a few huge Smith aficionados 
in back of the theater laughing 
their asses off following various 
mundane statements.
Watching this film is like watch
ing The Simpsons when every single 
character in Springfield is some
how part of a single episode. Pretty
A.I.s conclusion disappoints some
ARTIFICIAL, from page B8 
cial intelligence corporation have 
recently developed a new model  
a child mecha. They have created a 
y<>ung boy, programmed with the 
ability to love. Of course, this 
njakes you wonder  can love 
actually be programmed?
! The scientists find a family to test 
out the new model. The test fami
ly is a mother and father who have 
at son, but he is catatonic and 
beyond the help of doctors. The 
nfother slowly accepts her new 
cjiild though it is difficult because 
tl)e boy, David (actor Haley Joel 
Qsment), is not the same as a real 
bpy and at times his unusual 
behavior is actually frightening. 
TJiis begins the movies parallels 
v^ith Pinocchio. David hears the 
t^le of Pinocchio from his mother
for the remainder of the movie he 
pursues his dream of becoming a 
real boy. The movie continues fol
lowing the adventures of the 
mecha in his quest to become a real 
boy.
In arguably the most dramatic 
scene of the movie, David finds his 
life is in danger because of discrim
ination. He is captured by a group 
of mecha bounty-hunters that 
round up renegade robots. They 
take him to a mecha Flesh Fair 
where old or abandoned robots are 
destroyed for the amusement of 
the spectators. This scene remind
ed me of Gladiator, where slaves 
had been forced to fight and die in 
the arena for the entertainment of 
the crowd. This was a valuable 
scene in the film because it high
lighted the ugly aspect of human
nature that reacts violently to any 
group that threatens our domi
nance.
One of the most criticized ele
ments of A.I. is the tacked-on 
ending. The closing part of the 
movie is a rather sudden change, 
somewhat like stepping from a for
est into a desert. This last part of 
the movie may have been unneces
sary  it seems it may have been 
added to give the movie a more 
Disney-like ending. However, I feel 
that this is forgiveable and if it had 
not been included, audiences 
might have felt they were left hang
ing.
While A.I. is not perfect, it is a 
unique and interesting movie that 
is well worth spending time to see.
FINAL GRADE: A
AL
&
you could get this summer, Matchbox 20s concert 
experience wasnt too far behind. Who would have 
thought the two VH-1 sponsored concerts would have 
been the choice of this summer. Anyway, Matchbox 
20s evening started out with a performance by Train, 
a surprisingly great live band and opening act. Front 
man, Pat Monohan (a Pennsylvanian), enjoyed shak
ing and rubbing his butt to the audience, while belch
ing out impressive vocals, without looking like a 
pansy. Hard to imagine, but true. Plus the band did 
a good cover of a Led Zepplin tune, unlike Vertical 
Herizon, which earlier this summer managed to rip 
off Zeppelin every five minutes without giving any 
credit where it was deserved.
When Matchbox 20 finally took the stage they 
proved to be able to produce live a modern rock 
sound equal to their album, with just a little more 
guitar edge and grand piano stylings mixed in the 
performance. But the best part of their set was the 
rock n roll that busted out in front of me, in the club 
seats, where white trash usually doesnt lurk (I guess 
there is no getting around it in Pittsburgh) About six 
people, both boys and girls, fought over their man 
and woman as Rob Thomas sang Long Day and 
ended the night with a Black Crowes cover Jealous. 
How fitting.
But we cant forget where the best music comes 
from cocaine and anti-depressants. Brian Wilson 
delivered the drug product well as the opener for 
Paul Simon, who isnt worth critiquing. Wilson gave 
me perhaps the best musical experience I will ever get
a chance to witness. His writing was proof that har
monies can be cool perfect summer concert. Too bad. 
he really isnt with it, after his drug experience 
(which still continues on, as he likes to choke down 
anti-depressants)  Wilson spent most of the time 
sitting behind a keyboard singing. Sad part: he did
nt play the keyboard. Nope, he cant fool me, didnt, 
touch it once. However, at the end of his set he did 
manage to stand up and pluck away at the bass for 
one tune. Its okay though because he is one of the 
greatest songwriters pop music has ever had.
A summer of music cant be complete without chill
ing with a band. My time in Tulsa, Oklahoma allowed 
me to have a conversation with The Unlucky Ones, 
who are the alter ego pop band Admiral Twin. Being 
in the country, we spent most of are time trying to 
remember the lyrics to John Denvers Country 
Roads. (If you can, Im impressed.) They did per
form some Garth Brooks, 80s and 90s classics, and 
Admiral Twin signature tunes. (If you have no clue 
who I am talking about, which wouldnt surprise me, 
considering their record label, MOJO, recently went" 
bankrupt, check out http://www.admiraltwin.com.') \
With the summer over, Pittsburgh will make me a 
slave to my CMU studies, but do not fear: some good 
shows will be in town while we study. Janet Jackson 
has rescheduled her show for mid-October. David 
Nuvero will make a five-dollar appearance at Club M. 
Punk rockers Sum 41 and alternative American Hi-Fi 
will be paying us a visit. So save some cash, relax, 
and catch a live show.
much all the characters from 
Smiths previous films can be found 
here with only a few notable excep
tions, like Salma. Hayek, Linda 
Fiorentino (who had a big fight 
with Smith during the filming of 
Dogma), Claire Forlani, and that 
dude who couldnt see the sailboat 
in Mallrats. But dont be sad, since 
the stinkypalm is back, the story 
of that girl who drowned in the 
YMCA pool is still told, and Kevin 
Smith still hasnt forgotten to grab 
some material from Star Wars.
Its real simple: if you have never 
seen a Smith movie before and 
have no desire to, dont waste your 
money. You wont like Jay and 
Silent Bob Strike Back even though 
everyone from Jason Biggs to Jon 
Stewart is in it. If you havent seen 
all of Smiths works (Mallrats,  
Clerks, Chasing Amy, and Dogma) 
from start to end, or if its been a 
long time since youve watched 
them, I strongly recommend rent
ing them and watching them 
before going to see this movie. I 
never thought Id say this about Jay 
and Silent Bob, but by doing the 
above prep work, youll develop 
quite an appreciation for these guys 
and the rest of the Red Bank 
troupe.

Welcome students! This past week's enthralling orientation surely famil
iarized our new frosh with the ins, outs, and eccentricities of our campus. However, 
there is much more to college in Pittsburgh than our campus. There's Pittsburgh! Let 
this edition of Calendar serve as the Pittsburgh orientation for the freshmen. There 
is really so much to do here, so only the da' basics of da' Burgh will be listed.

Pittsburghers are passionate about their teams, despite how poorly they often 
do. The three major teams here, the Steelers, the Pirates, and the Penguins all 
have major support here. The new PNC Park and Heinz Field are gorgeous to 
boot. Hopefully the new field will have a better effect on the Steelers then it 
did on the Bucs. Perhaps well be hosting an NFC championship game? If 
you like hockey, you can watch Mario and his Pens in Mellon Arena. The sea
son starts October 3, and student rush tickets are often available.
Pittsburghs cultural life is as vital as that of any American city. At the forefront 
is the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, regarded by some as the best orchestra 
in the world. Maestro Mariss Jansonss expert musicianship is at the helm of 
the great ensemble. The Pittsburgh Opera Company productions are first-rate 
as well. Recent shows include The Marriage of Figaro and Turandot. Local 
museums, including The Carnegie and the Andy Warhol Museum, are free with 
your CMU ID, so be sure to check those out.
Pittsburghs neighborhoods offer flavor and diversity to this great city. Each 
neighborhood has its own personality. Bask in the stately elegance of Squirrel 
Hill by taking in a movie in the Manor Theatre or having dinner at Gulliftys. Go 
north a few blocks and walk along the hip Walnut Street in Shadyside. While 
youre there, stop at the Banana Republic for some new duds, or get a quick bite 
to eat at Pamelas. Just west of our campus is the lively Oakland, home of the 
Pittsburgh Panthers. Kuntz Bakery on Forbes is great, check it out. From the 
South Side to the Strip, there is never a lack of actvity in Pittsburgh.
