Architects unveil Gates Center design
Organizations 
see budgets 
reduced
New groups force 
allocation cuts
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
In case this years 103 student 
groups did not meet the student 
bodys needs, 26 new organiza
tions are looking for a piece of 
the student activities fee.
The groups include a variety of 
cultural groups, sports groups, 
and two big event groups, ac
cording to Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) chair Nicholas 
Scocozzo, a senior in chemi
cal and biological engineering. 
This increase could result in an 
increase for Carnegie Mellons 
student activities fee.
If we continue to see an up
ward trend in the number of 
organizations and group activi
ties and a downward trend in 
our surplus every year, then I 
think a referendum could be re
alistic, said Gina Casalegno, the 
director of Student Activities.
The committee released its 
first round of budget recom
mendations last Tuesday. The 
recommendations are in re
sponse to the initial requests of 
over 129 student groups. The 
JFC, responsible for adminis
tering University funds to stu
dent organizations, received a 
record $1.3 million in requests 
from various groups on cam
pus. According to Scocozzo, JFC 
bylaws require that no more than 
$500 be given to new groups.

prior to requesting JFC funding

bold campus. There is none other 
like it in the United States. I dont 
think there is another one like it 
the world.
Scogin noted that what makes 
the campus bold is its two main 
organizing spaces.
The architect and his partners 
took a long look at Hornbostels 
designs, such as the College of 
Fine Arts building, and analyzed 
the way Hornbostel used archi
tectural elements on the outsides 
of his buildings to define spaces 
on the insides.
Hamerschlag Hall, Porter Hall, 
Baker Hall  this is some of the 
weirdest, strangest architecture by 
an iconoclastic architect, Scogin 
said, referring to Hornbostels use 
of domes, arches, pediments, and 
other simple architectural devices 
in complex or creative ways.
The Beginning
We wanted a place where you 
can enter into physically and psy
chologically. Thats the idea of 
these buildings, Scogin said.
On a less philosophical level, 
the administration and the 
School of Computer Science had 
some very specific goals in mind 
for a new building on campus. 
Ralph Horgan, associate vice
provost of Campus Design and 
Facility Development, outlined 
the Universitys goals.

Architect Mack Scogin walked 
onto the Carnegie Mellon campus 
last Monday, and for the first time, 
he didnt come empty-handed. He 
brought with him a design that he 
hopes will revolutionize Carnegie 
Mellon and send it hurtling into 
the future.
Scogin and his partner Merrill 
Elam have been designing the 
Gates Center for Computer 
Science for almost a year now, 
and on Monday they were finally 
ready to give the campus a pre
view of whats to come.
On Monday, students in the 
School of Computer Science (SCS) 
got the first look at the newly re
leased designs of the Gates Center 
in several private information ses
sions. Later that day, Scogin gave 
a lecture at Carnegie Lecture Hall 
in Oakland, where he presented 
the design to an audience of stu
dents, faculty, alumni, and com
munity members.
Scogin prefaced his designs by 
speaking at great length about 
Henry Hornbostel, Carnegie 
Mellons first architect. Scogins 
design for the Gates Center was 
in large part influenced by his in
terpretation of Hornbostels bold 
and creative designs.
I have tried to make this argu
ment, and I think Im right about 
this, Scogin said, setting the tone 
for his design. The Carnegie 
Mellon campus is an incredibly

Interim dean of Student Af
fairs Jennifer Church has been 
officially named dean of Student 
Affairs, vice-president of Enroll
ment William Elliott announced 
in a press conference last Mon
day.
Church has served in the 
interim dean position since June, 
when former dean Michael Mur
phy was promoted to associate 
vic-president of the University.
Under Church, Paul Fowler 
is staying on as associate dean 
of Student Affairs, while Ann 
Witchner has taken over as as
sistant dean.
The installation of Church as 
dean brings to a close a national

See DEAN, page A5 Jennifer Church was named dean of Student Affairs last Monday. She previously served as interim dean.
Cognition Lab, and her work on 
the Student Advisory Council, she 
has taken on significant leader
ship positions on campus as the 
committee chair for MOSAIC, a 
sexual assault advisor, and a head 
orientation counselor. Somehow, 
however, Edwards has not only 
managed to juggle each respon
sibility; she has set lofty goals for 
each one of her extracurricular 
commitments.
Honestly, being a student is 
probably the least commitment 
I have, Edwards said. With her 
numerous responsibilities, she 
combined her coursework and 
research into 42 total units this 
spring, allowing time to prepare 
for MOSAIC, the LSAT, and next 
semesters Orientation. I try to 
keep myself organized, having 
to-do lists and visually checking
them off. I try to be as effective 
as possible with my time, she 
continued. Ive realized that at 
Carnegie Mellon you really have 
to find what your passion is and 
stick to that.
From her work in MOSAIC to 
developing the sexual assault 
advisors program, Edwards has 
contributed tremendously to 
womens and gender issues at 
Carnegie Mellon. In the fall of 
2004 she went through sexual 
assault advisor training and 
grew enthusiastic about the 
cause. I realized that I was a 
passionate feminist who has al
ways cared about womens is
sues. It was just something that 
was hidden, Edwards said. I

Five bucks per semester from every 
undergraduate student adds up to a 
hefty sum of money. So why are we 
throwing it away?
Reading a newspaper keeps us in 
touch with the world around us, it helps 
us make important decisions in our 
daily lives, and it brings our education 
to life. So who could argue against hav
ing freely available copies of The New 
York Times, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and 
USA Today around campus?
Actually, about 90 percent of us could 
 and should  argue.
Last year, students voted to require 
that all undergraduate students pay 
a five-dollar-per-semester fee to make 
newspapers available to undergrads. 
Our student government and the 
Department of Student Affairs opted 
to use the money to participate in the 
Collegiate Readership Program, which 
now distributes the three newspapers 
you see around campus. It all seems like 
a pretty good deal.
Look more closely and youll see that 
the Collegiate Readership Program, 
which is just a well-named sales 
campaign by USA Today, is actually 
ineffective and wasteful.
On any given weekday, about 550 
newspapers are taken from the cases 
and bins of the Collegiate Readership 
Program. That means that less than 
10 percent of undergrads pick up a 
newspaper on the average day.
Also keep in mind that all of the four 
bins in residence halls are open to any
one who walks in  they're not even 
behind the security door  and the 
cases in the public locations dont distin
guish between fee-paying undergrads 
and freeloading graduate students. 
Undergrads are paying for more than 
just their own free newspapers.
Finally, taking a newspaper is not the 
same as reading a newspaper. I would 
bet that a good chunk of the newspapers 
get taken are never even read. Because 
theyre pre-paid, theres no reason not 
to take a newspaper whether or not 
youre going to read it.
If the goal was to promote newspaper 
readership in the hopes of having a 
more informed, more engaged under
graduate student body, this program 
is failing.
In effect, what we have is a system 
whereby all undergraduates pay for a 
minority of students to get the news
paper they might otherwise have read 
online for free or bought themselves. 
Also, theres redundancy in the system. 
We already pay for our institutional 
access to LexisNexis.com, which gives 
us access to all the content in the news
papers we get.
If we want to promote newspaper 
readership, theres a more effective, 
more efficient way to do it.
To make our newspaper readership 
program successful, we need to give 
people a reason to read the newspaper. 
The most important thing we can do is 
to enlist the facultys support in making 
newspapers part of the classroom expe-' 
rience. Also, we could bring journalists 
to campus as lecturers to inspire greater 
appreciation of journalism  USA 
Today promised they would do this, but 
has yet to deliver.
Of course, getting newspapers to stu
dents is key. But rather than asking 
everyone to pay for the newspapers 
that just a few people take, a success
ful readership program would help 
students buy their own subscriptions, 
giving them greater ownership in the 
newspaper experience. It could be as 
simple as giving people the option to 
buy their own subscriptions at a dis
counted and subsidized rate, or it could 
let them pay a small fee on an annual 
or semesterly basis for access to news
paper display cases. A free trial period 
each semester could win subscribers.
The benefit of this approach is that 
only students who value and plan to 
use the service will choose to get sub
scriptions. It reduces the burden on the 
student body as a whole and will have a 
greater effect on the people who choose 
to participate.
But to make any of this happen, stu
dent government has to step up to the 
plate and make some changes.

University meets new level of clean; janitor pride doesnt reflect
by Jaisen Bell
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon University 
facilities have reached a new 
standard of cleanliness, while 
janitorial workers find working 
conditions anything but spotless.
Last month, for the first time 
in school history, every academic 
and administrative campus 
building Carnegie Mellon oper
ates reached or exceeded the 
Association of Higher Education 
Facilities Officers (APPA) stan
dards for cleanliness.
The APPA is considered an au
thority in facility management 
standards, and it prescribes ap
propriate levels of cleanliness for 
an environment that effectively 
supports its faculty and students.
This standard was met through 
a change in methodology estab
lished when Central Property 
Services (CPS), a third party who 
handles the schools custodial 
concerns, renewed its contract 
with Carnegie Mellon in June 
2004, according to Don Coffelt, 
director of Carnegie Mellons 
Facilities Management Services.
Im very pleased with both 
our approach to the delivery of 
custodial services and its results, 
Coffelt stated in an e-mail.
The 112 full-time janitors and 
nine supervisors shifted from a 
task-driven approach to a pre
scriptive approach based on 
overall performance. This means 
if a carpet was scheduled to be 
vacuumed but did not need to be 
vacuumed, instead of cleaning 
it the worker would move on to 
something else that required at
tention, Coffelt explained..
Performance against this stan
dard has been evaluated every 
six months by a third party, with 
physical inspection being per
formed by John Moran of Premier 
Facility Solutions.
Evaluations have improved 
each time, with 38 percent of 
academic and administrative 
buildings failing to meet the 
standard in October 2004 and 
13 percent in October 2005. By 
March 2006, every academic and 
administrative building on cam
pus met the standard.
According to Coffelt, Carnegie 
Mellon began outsourcing its cus
todial services in 1983 through a
bidding system.
CPS took over in 1996 and pro
vided services until June 2004, at 
which point they were awarded 
the contract a second time. The 
current contract includes provi
sions to have continued service 
through 2012.
Working conditions
Some workers, who chose to 
remain anonymous out of con
cern for their livelihood, felt the 
work environment created by 
management was sub-par.
One worker who has worked 
at Carnegie Mellon for over 25 
years explained that since the 
outsourcing of the contract, in 
addition to not being able to feel 
part the University, workers have 
lost University employee privi
leges. These include the ability 
to bid for new jobs within the 
University, to take classes to
wards a Carnegie Mellon degree, 
and to have their children attend 
Carnegie Mellon for free.
Another worker brought up 
concerns about the number of

Conference discusses military contributions at the university
by Patrick Pettibon
Junior Staffwriter
The campus may not have 
missile silos under the Cut, but 
Carnegie Mellon may be more 
like a military base than com
monly thought.
Concern is growing among 
Pittsburgh residents and Carnegie 
Mellon students about the extent 
of research funded at the Uni
versity through military, defense, 
and security contracts. The fund
ing is leading to new research 
in almost every department 
and acheiving advancements 
in robotics and software 
engineering.
On Saturday, the Pittsburgh 
Organizing Group and the 
Progressive Student Alliance 
held a Counter-Recruitment Con
ference at Carnegie Mellon. In a 
talk titled The Military Industrial-Academic Complex and its 
Discontents, David Meieran, a
member of the Pittsburgh Or
ganizing Group in the Thomas 
Merton Center, also included 
the National Science Founda
tion among the list of military 
researchers.
According to Meieran, Carn
egie Mellon is a central part of 
the academic-industrial military 
complex.
Research performed at Carn
egie Mellon is funded by such 
government departments as the 
Department of Defense and the 
Department of Homeland Secu
rity, and corporations like Boeing 
and Lockheed Martin.
Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared Cohon lauded a new project 
funded by a $25 million National 
Science Foundation grant in this 
years Annual Report, which out
lines the Universitys budget. The 
grant funds a joint project with 
the University of Pittsburgh to 
create the Pittsburgh Science of 
Learning Center.
Last July, the Air Force awarded
a cost reimbursement contract 
worth over $411 million to the 
Software Engineering Institute. 
The contract specifies that it will 
provide for research and devel
opment, pertinent to national 
defense.
Additionally, last August, 
Carnegie Mellon unveiled Gladi
ator, a remote-controlled, 
unmanned ground vehicle. The 
Navy awarded the University a 
contract worth over $26 million 
to produce six prototypes like 
Gladiator for expected produc
tion in 2007.
A significant portion of stu
dents and facultys workload 
is devoted to the academicindustrial military complex, 
Meieran said. It pushes CMU 
deeper and deeper into normal
izing military research.
Much of the research at Carn
egie Mellon indirectly ties the 
school and the students to the 
military. The Department of 
Defenses website shows that
the Robotics Institue has been 
contracting with the military for 
years. The Department of Defense 
funded several projects, includ
ing one that led to the invention 
of soccer-playing robots.
The Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency (DARPA) 
also funds the Robotics Insti
tute and Software Engineering 
Institute. Carnegie Mellon was 
awarded $1.5 million in 2001 for 
the Perception of Off-Road Ve
hicles program.
General Dynamics Robotic Sys
tems, Inc., which collaborated 
with the Robotics Institute at 
Carnegie Mellon, received a grant 
for $1.49 million. PerceptOR, as 
the project was called for short, 
funded several groups that went 
on to participate in the DARPA 
Grand Challenge.
Daniel Papasian, a senior in 
social and decision sciences and 
member of the Progressive Stu
dent Alliance, spoke at Satur
days Counter-Recruitment Con
ference. He outlined a plan to 
help students avoid participating 
in research against which they 
might have moral issues.
The plan begins with 
exposure, he said, finding infor
mation about what groups fund 
each department or program at 
the University.
Papasian also spoke on the 
idea of dual use. The research, 
though funded by the military, 
may also have potential for hu
manitarian purposes as well.
According to their website, the 
Software Engineering Institute is 
developing new systems for net
work security, online safety, and 
software development models. 
Likewise, projects to develop 
robots that do everything from 
mow the lawn to shake your hand 
are occurring at the Robotics 
Institute.
You have to appropriate what 
you can, Papasian said, use 
[new technology] for any good 
you can.
FBI investigates 
peace protest
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh-based Thomas 
Merton Center for Peace and 
Justice (TMC) has long been 
part of the movement for find
ing solutions in the War on Ter
ror. Now subject to repeated FBI 
investigations, the group is en
countering more problems re
sulting from the war effort than 
solutions.
The FBI has been investigat
ing the group because of its 
political opposition to warfare 
and reports of a person of in
vestigative interest, according 
to FBI special agent Jeff Killeen 
and a document released by the 
TMC on March 14.
Two documents released by 
the FBI on March 14 confirmed 
for the first time that the FBI is 
targeting the TMC specifically 
because the group opposes the 
war in Iraq, according to a press 
release by the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU).
FBI presence as a result of 
both the release of these docu
ments and surveillance at the 
groups anti-war protest on 
March 18 outraged the TMC.
On March 21, the left-wing 
activist group staged a spyin at the federal building in 
downtown Pittsburgh. A crowd 
of approximately 30 people 
donned spy gear and stood out
side the government building 
to protest government spying 
and intimidation, according 
to the Thomas Merton Centers 
Anti-War Committee website.
We want to publicize the fact 
that our government is spying 
on peace activists, and we want 
to let the public know that this 
is their tax dollars at work, 
said Mary B. OMalley, a spy-in 
participant.
Something is seriously 
wrong, in how our government 
determines who and what con
stitutes terrorism when peace 
activists find themselves tar
geted, stated the ACLU in the 
press release.

A 3-D model shows how the Gates Center will feature a bridge walkway to the Purnell Center. The Gates Center will take up 5.6 acres of the West Campus and is set to stand 100 years without repairs or replacements. The building 
will feature six front doors at five different elevations, and the exterior will be perforated with windows.
JFC cuts organizations budgets
BUDGET, from A1
can bypass this provision.
Scocozzo added that the JFC 
had to reduce the $1.3 million in 
requests down to $974,282.38, 
the total amount allocated from 
the Carnegie Mellon student ac
tivities fee for various University 
organizations.
The Joint Funding Committee 
is composed of 11 members. 
The student vice-president for 
Finance must serve, accord
ing to the Committees bylaws. 
The undergraduate and gradu
ate finance chairs, the Graduate 
Student Assembly chair, the 
Student Senate chair, and six 
elected members comprise the 
rest of the committee.
Each member of the JFC 
represents approximately 12 
groups. As a representative, the 
JFC member is responsible for 
presenting and explaining the 
budget proposals to the entire 
committee. Generally, the six 
elected members are Student 
Senate members. Currently, there 
are five undergraduates and one 
graduate student in this delega
tion, according to Scocozzo.
The JFC is forced to make some 
difficult cutting decisions as a re
sult of the influx of new groups.
They want to cut four issues 
of readme, said senior lighting 
design major Andrew Moore, 
chair of the Activities Board (AB). 
readme is Carnegie Mellons 
weekly student-run satire maga
zine.
Ira Glass more than sold out 
McConomy Auditorium; Ian 
Mackaye filled Doherty 2210.
There were people sitting in the 
aisles. We are bringing events 
that people want to see, Moore 
said.
AB is one of the largest groups 
on campus with 11 subgroups, 
including AB Lectures, Concerts, 
and Films. Both AB Political 
Speakers and Concerts have seen 
cuts of about $7000 to their bud
gets, while AB Films saw a budget 
increase from last year, according 
to Moore.
Bands that are coming through 
here, by contract wont use our 
equipment. By purchasing new 
equipment, we dont have to 
spend on rentals. If we dont get 
that funding, the acts wont be as 
exciting or well-known, Moore 
said.
Scocozzo claims the amount 
spent on events during Carnival, 
Carnegie Mellons annual spring 
celebration, will not decrease.
There is so much inherent 
value in that, he said. What 
is the time you remember most 
at Carnegie Mellon? Its always 
Carnival.
For the 2005-2006 school year, 
almost half of students money 
went to Carnival, concerts, and 
movies; community service, sup
port, and advocacy groups were 
earmarked for 3.7 percent of 
these funds. Scocozzo would not 
comment on the nature of the 
groups receiving cuts this year.
I think our cultural groups are 
under-resourced for what they 
bring to campus, Casalegno 
said.
Jennifer Church, the newly in
stated dean of Student Affairs, 
attributed the cutbacks entirely 
to the new groups.
This is a pretty significant in
crease in Student Organizations, 
Church said. The campus is 
always evolving and changing. 
Our ability to ebb and flow is a 
critical part of the campus com
munity.
Church also discussed a refer
endum process: If the JFC sees 
the need to raise the student ac
tivities fee by five percent, more 
than the usual Consumer Price 
Index-based increase meant 
to offset inflation, it must get 
permission from the University 
Board of Trustees to put the 
issue up to a University-wide ref
erendum.
If students make a strong 
case, then [a raise in the fee] is 
likely, but it is hard when youre 
rolling a surplus of $50,000 a 
year, Casalegno said, referring 
to unspent funds that were allo
cated to organizations from year 
to year. For the past several years, 
unspent funds have ranged from 
$50,000 to $80,000.
I havent heard of any interest 
for a referendum from students, 
said Casalegno.
Church claimed that it has 
been a number of years since the 
last referendum.
We should look at groups 
that are very successful. There 
is money to go around, but what 
I think we need to do is look at 
what the other options are for 
fundraising, Church said.
Moore expressed a desire to 
see an increase in the student 
activities fee.
I think that there needs to be 
more money in the pot. Five dol
lars wont hurt anyone, but it will 
make a big difference, he said.
Leadership series honors Edwards
PROFILE, from A1
issue sexual assault was until I became an 
advisor.
After six weeks of training, however, she noticed 
that the program was not making full use of its 
advisors. According to Edwards, There was just 
so much passion and energy and great spark, but 
nowhere to funnel it into... We know what assault 
is; we know how to handle it; we know what the re
sources are. But what can we do aside from waiting 
around for people to contact us?
Edwards teamed up with fellow advisor Laura 
Martin to change the organizations focus towards 
more active outreach. Further collaboration with 
Jennifer Church brought about the idea of creating 
a hierarchy within the existing organization and 
established a Board of Directors.
Edwards has high hopes for the future of Sexual 
Assault Advisors. My personal goal is to institute 
an educational program within the first month of 
school for all first-year living areas, she said.
In addition, she hopes to encourage more men to 
take a proactive role in issues surrounding sexual 
assault. Men themselves can be assaulted, said 
Edwards. They are also affected by assault on 
women, through their mothers, their daughters, 
their sisters.
Beyond Sexual Assault Advisors, Edwards tar
geted her passion for gender issues towards her job 
as MOSAIC committee chair. Although the focus 
of the conference has been gradually shifting from 
exclusively womens issues to gender issues, she 
was the first chair to make a concentrated effort to 
make this transition complete. She included several 
men on her committee as well as graduate students 
and alumni, and introduced a mens subcommittee 
to the process.
I tried to get as broad of a representation of 
Carnegie Mellon as possible, Edwards explained 
and emphasized her overall contentment with 
MOSAICS outcome. We were able to pull together 
well a cross-generational dialogue on campus. We 
really made it a very diverse sort of conference 
that addressed a lot of issues facing a lot of genera
tions, she said.
Edwards had planned to go into politics since her
junior year of high school, but her experience at 
Carnegie Mellon has helped her narrow down her 
area of focus.
I came here with very lofty and undefined goals; 
I wanted to do a more international focus and 
was looking into the UN, but then I realized that 
Im more interested in domestic issues, and I 
think that you have to take care of that first, she 
recalled.
Edwards emphasizes that her unique opportuni 
ties at Carnegie Mellon have now brought her to her 
set path of law school and womens issues.
Ive loved every moment of my Carnegie Mellon 
career, she said, noting she feels obligated to give 
back to the community that has given her so many 
fantastic opportunities.
Although Carnegie Mellons humanities majors 
often do not receive as much recognition as the 
technical or artistic majors, Edwards considers 
herself to be lucky for having chosen a less conven
tional field of study. I dont think I could have had 
[an internship at a U.S. Congressmans office] if I 
went to a political science school.
As a head Orientation counselor, the rest of 
Edwards semester is now focused on extending her 
comfort at Carnegie Mellon to future first-years 
We are trying to make [Orientation] as amazing 
a program as possible for both first-years and for 
Orientation counselors.
She is working closely with housefellows to make 
sure that commuter students, temporary housing 
students, and students in nontraditional first-year 
areas like Oakland Apartments, West Wing, or 
Resnik have as positive a start to their college 
careers as possible.
Raised in the small town of Struthers, Ohio, 
Edwards feels that the diverse environment of 
Carnegie Mellon has made her more open minded 
Here I have met people literally from every walk of 
life.... People are constantly amazing me with what 
they do, with things I didnt even know existed. 
Edwards described her college career to have 
made her both more optimistic and more cynical.
Im more aware of problems in society that need 
to be addressed, but I also feel slightly more opti
mistic because I feel like Im prepared to go out and 
tackle them.
Gates Center architect unveils building design
GATES, from A1
the Cut with the West Campus, in 
fact, creating a new west campus 
quad that would rival in space the 
Cut and the Mall for open space 
on this campus, Horgan said. 
He also noted the desire to cre
ate a proper entrance on Forbes 
Avenue.
According to Guy Blelloch, as
sociate dean for planning for the 
School of Computer Science, a 
committee of SCS faculty con
vened as soon as the school knew 
about the Gates project to deter
mine what the school needed in a 
new facility.
The initial reason for the new 
building is that we have grown 
tremendously, Blelloch said. 
Citing a 100 percent growth in 
last several years, he noted de
partment members are spread 
out  on Craig Street, and in 
Lawrenceville, for example. The 
purpose of the building is to 
get Computer Science back to
gether.
According to Blelloch, the SCS 
panel analyzed the traffic flow on 
campus to understand how busy 
the different entrances and path
ways in the new building were 
going to be. They also looked 
at pedestrian volume during the 
transition from class to class and 
locations of various residence 
halls.
To get a good feel for the 
latest in academic facility design, 
Blelloch and the committee trav
eled to over 15 different campuses 
and investigated 30 buildings.
Taking their cues from both 
the Office of Campus Design 
and Facility Development and 
the School of Computer Science, 
Scogin and Elams goal was to 
create a space where professors 
and students would feel comfort
U.S. Green Building LEED silver 
rating, but Scogin admitted they 
can do better. Ralph Horgan be
lieves the building may be in a 
position to receive a gold rating.
Volker Harfkopf, professor of 
architecture and co-founder and 
director of the Center for Building 
Performance and Diagnostics 
(CBPD), however, remained 
unconvinced by what he has 
heard.
You said you are going to 
meet LEED silver standards, 
Hartkopf said, reminding Scogin 
that Carnegie Mellon has made 
a strong committment to sustain
ability. Thats not leadership. 
Carnegie Mellon does not want 
to be a follower.
Vivian Loftness, also a professor 
of architecture and another mem
ber of the CBPD, voiced concerns 
about the statement that Scogins 
design will make at night.
It just seems that the propor
tion of the window is a critical 
factor and it will really show up 
at night time, Loftness said. 
Youll start to know whether the 
windows have that generosity 
adjacent to the Hornbostel build
ing or whether they look like the 
punctured windows we see in 
Wean Hall.
The question on everyones 
mind, however, was not voiced 
by a professor of architecture. It 
was a design student at Scogins 
lecture who asked: Will it fit the 
campus?
It will fit. It will be different  
it will speak to something about 
the future of the University, 
Scogin said.
You cant make the mistake 
of something too modest, too 
small. Hornbostel would be the 
first to tell you, Dont do that, for 
Gods sake! Use the tools of your 
time.
able doing individual research. 
According to Blelloch, the space 
would also have to be conducive 
to collective and interdisciplinary 
work.
One of the things that was very 
important to us was collabora
tion, Blelloch said. We want to 
foster collaboration both within 
the School of Computer Science, 
but also help other people from 
other schools to collaborate with 
us.
Purnell Center, a caf, a private 
underground parking garage, 318 
offices, a 250-seat auditorium, a 
three-story breezeway between 
Gates and Donor X, and a land
scaped link to the Cut.
Its a huge site and it will 
change the face of the West 
Campus, Horgan said.
Scogin has not yet decided ex
actly what the faade of the build
ing will look like. The lower floors 
and the three-story bridge from
take pedestrians through the core 
of the building. The oval ramp 
spans three floors and will wrap 
around classrooms, offices, and 
an open computer cluster.
This is a transformation of an 
academic building. Generally, you 
dont invite the public into aca
demic building, Scogin said. Its 
inviting to the rest of campus.
The building will have six front 
doors at five different elevations, 
Scogin said, explaining that the
The Donor X building is 
purely for research, the same with 
uppermost levels of the Gates 
building. Donor X, in addition to 
certain parts of the Gates Center, 
will feature green roofs.
In the distant future, Horgan 
foresees a bridge over Panther 
Hollow that will connect the Gates 
Center and the West Campus to 
the intersection of Forbes Avenue 
and Craig Street.
Around the Gates Center, 
landscape architect Michael 
Van Valkenburgh has designed 
a brand new quad with green 
space and walkways compli
ant with the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. The hallmark of 
Van Valkenburghs design is the 
Winter Garden, a green space 
built into the grade of the hill 
that will extend the West Campus 
quad right up into the Gates 
Center and beyond.
You cant make the mistake of something too 
modest, too small.
 Mack Scogin, architect for the Gates Center
The Design
The 159,000-square-foot 
Gates Center and its surround
ing landscaping will take up 5.6 
acres of West Campus. Attached 
to the Gates Center itself will 
be another, smaller building, 
tentatively named Donor X 
building.
The original grant from the 
Gates Foundation specified a 
150,000-square-foot building. 
According to Horgan, however, 
SCS needed at least 200,000 
square feet of space to move com
pletely out of Wean Hall. The 
decision was made then to attach 
a 50,000-square-foot building to 
the Gates Center and create a 
naming opportunity. So far, there 
is no Donor X.
The center will feature an eightfoot-wide bridge from outside the
Gates to Donor X will be entirely 
made of glass. The upper, more 
visible floors will be covered in ei
ther zinc or slate panels that will 
be perforated with windows. The 
exact hue of the paneling and the 
tint of the windows are subject 
to ongoing discussion, but 
Scogins main goal is to bring 
natural light into every space in 
the building.
We dont have a resolution on 
the exterior, Horgan said. We 
need to do some listening to peo
ple on that.
All the exterior materials will 
require little or no maintenance, 
in accordance with Scogins goal 
that the Gates Center be a 100- 
year building, or that no part 
of it will need to be repaired or 
replaced for at least 100 years.
To funnel traffic through the 
building, Scogin has designed an 
internal ramp system that will
Gates Center will have no real 
back door.
What makes it complicated 
is that 360 degrees around this 
building there are 360-degree 
changes of how you want to take 
in this building, he said.
According to Scogin, the first 
three floors of the Gates Center 
will primarily be the teaching lev
els. They will also be the most 
public areas in the building. The 
fourth floor houses the largest 
classrooms and offices.
The new planetary robot
ics center will be on the lowest 
level, with access to the loading 
docks. Scogin plans to build the 
planetary robotics department 
a rugged open space called a 
Mars Yard meant to mimic the 
terrain of Mars. The yard will 
used to test new robots and will 
be highly accessible to pedestri
ans using West Campus.
The Concerns
A primary concern of some 
non-computer science students is 
that they will never have the op
portunity to use the new facility.
According to Scogin, the 
amount of interdisciplinary study 
that goes on will depend on how 
the spaces are programmed by 
the School of Computer Science. 
In his opinion, there is a lot of 
room for collaborative and inter
disciplinary work in the building.
Blelloch agreed, stating that 
one of SCSs goals is to bring 
non-computer science students 
into the building.
Many audience members at 
Scogins lectures were concerned 
about how environmentally 
friendly the new Gates Center 
will be.
According to Scogin, his part

THE TARTAN  APRIL 10, 2006ASChurchnameddean
Custodians want both job and cleaning standards set high
DEAN, from A1
out that the University had 
selected Jen Church to be our 
permanent dean. Even as a se
nior, I am glad that the next 
wave of students will get to 
work with Jen Church, said 
Shan Arunachalam, a senior in 
business administration.
As dean, Church is involved 
in many projects with students 
and organizations. In her time 
as interim dean, Church has 
initiated new programs on 
campus, such as the Late Night 
program and the Greek Task 
Force.
In the upcoming year, Stu
dent Affairs will continue to 
develop opportunities to en
gage students in the academic, 
social, and cultural life of the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
and the broader Pittsburgh 
area, she said.
Additionally, Church has 
long-term goals for the campus 
community.
Our long-term vision for 
the student experience is based 
on the opportunity for every 
student to engage in experi
ences that promote his or her 
artistic and intellectual curios
ity, community engagement, 
personal well-being, profes
sional competency, leadership 
development, and social re
sponsibility, stated Church.
Based on past experiences, 
students are excited to work 
with Church in the future.
I found her to be a very 
friendly and approachable per
son because of her ability to 
communicate with people, said 
Amanda Ip, a junior industrial 
design major. Ip worked with 
Church during Orientation.
Hussein Al Baya, a senior in 
business administration, has 
also worked with Church and 
expressed confidence in the 
selection: Her experience,
passion, and dedication to our 
university and its students are 
simply incomparable.
JANITORS, from A3
employees on the job. We dont 
have the manpower to do it, but 
we get pushed to do it, stated the 
worker, who noted that the facil
ity being cleaned had three fewer 
workers now than when Carnegie 
Mellon handled the contract.
Rege Koslof, CPS director of 
custodial services, sees things 
differently.
Everyone is overworked in 
every profession. This is an ex
ample of some people having the 
fortune to be passionate about 
their work and others just seeing 
it as a job.
One worker expressed dissatis
faction with the uniforms.
Lookat this shirt I am wearing. 
The worker was wearing a faded, 
worn, long-sleeved button-down 
with Central Property Services 
on the left chest. This was given 
to me by an older worker. CPS 
gives us two T-shirts a year. How 
am I supposed to take pride in 
myself when I am wearing the 
same shirt every other day?
The worker .then pointed to 
a picture of a Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus. See the pride in that
mans face. He would be ashamed 
if he saw what was going on 
here.
A Future
In terms of working for CPS 
at Carnegie Mellon as a career, 
the turnover rate has dropped 
to a five-year low of around 
25 percent a year, most of 
which occur in the first couple 
years of employment, Koslof 
explained.
Some workers attribute attri
tion to a lack of ability to improve 
themselves.
We should not worry about 
increasing the benefits for people 
on the bottom, but those that 
have been here for 20 or 40 
years, said one worker.
The benefits available at uni
versities such as Carnegie Mellon 
exceed those at CPS office build
ings. Denardo explained that the 
benefits operate on a hierarchal 
system based on how much time 
is spent with the company. The 
system sees increases in vaca
tion and sick days over 20-year 
periods, but hourly pay plateaus 
at $13.20 after three and half
years of service. Everyone re
ceives a 40-cent-per-hour pay 
raise each year to account for 
inflation.
I have been here two years, 
and next year, I will be making 
the same amount as a person 
who has been here over 40 years. 
Its just not right, one worker 
said.
Koslof noted that other profes
sionals, such as plumbers and 
electricians, deal directly with the 
school. He felt negotiating two 
separate contracts, one with the 
union and one with the school, 
renewed on different dates, made 
things more complicated.
The Recent Protests
On March 25, 20 janitors gath
ered in front of the Collaborative 
Innovation Center (CIC) to 
distribute leaflets concerning 
non-union wages the buildings 
custodial staff was receiving. This 
followed a 40-person rally the 
previous Thursday expressing the 
same concerns.
According to union organizer 
Tim Finucan, the building , is a 
threat to Carnegie Mellon jani
tors. It is a possible infringement 
on full-time jobs, benefits, and 
the ability of University janitors 
to support their families. Another 
concern regarded the building, 
which receives $11.4 million 
in public funding, that pays its 
workers poverty wages.
Carnegie Mellon is the main 
tenant of the CIC building, which 
sits on the Universitys campus. 
Currently, the building is owned 
by JJ Gumberg Co. and run by 
LG Realty Advisors, which hired 
Quality Service Incorporated and 
its non-union workers to attend 
to the buildings custodial needs. 
The seven non-union janitors in 
the CIC building make an hourly 
rate of $7.50 with no benefits.
According to Finucan, the 
University will eventually annex 
the building.
Once the building is under 
CMU control, the low standards 
currently afforded to the jani
torial staff in CIC could affect 
bargaining poWer. Whether its 
one, seven, or 1000 workers in 
the building, a threat to stan
dards is a threat to standards, 
stated Finucan. We just want 
a responsible contractor to pay
union wages.
The Reality of It All
With no established safety 
net, many workers felt they were 
trapped in the system and were 
hesitant to leave because of the 
risk involved.
I cannot risk not being able to 
support my family, one worker 
said.
In addition to job stability, older 
workers feel the need to stay to 
collect their pension, and most 
are ineligible for Social Security 
due to salaries that surpass the 
minimum to qualify.
I take pride in my work and 
will try to keep going as long as 
I can because nobody is going to 
pay my bills. I will just work until 
I drop dead, a worker said.
But gestures from the students 
help the workers feel appreci
ated.
At the end of the year when 
I worked in Mudge, the RAs and 
students got together and took 
a group picture and gave me a 
nice letter they all signed, said 
one employee. That made it all 
worth it.
FBI investigates peace protests by Thomas Merton Center
FBI, from A3
by repeated FBI surveillance that they 
believe is completely unwarranted, ac
cording to Dave Meieran of the Thomas 
Merton Center.
Its just ridiculous, said Colby Tarnauskas, a senior biology major and intern for 
the TMC. Why would you waste taxpay
ers money spying on us?
According to Killeen, TMC meetings and 
sponsored events, which the FBI has been 
monitoring since 2002, have been tar
geted not because of the Thomas Merton 
Center itself, but because of a person of 
investigative interest who may have been 
present at those events.
The FBI cannot investigate any person 
without predication. There has to be a 
connection between that activity and that 
person, Killeen said. If [the TMC] is out 
there doing peace activist work, fine. But if 
theres someone there who is suspected of 
a crime, we have to watch them.
Activists feel their First Amendment 
rights are being infringed upon, which 
prevents them from protecting their
civil liberties.
Do we threaten the current administra
tions erosion of civil liberties by exercising 
our democratic rights? asked Tom Vining, a target of FBI spying and author of 
an additional ACLU press statement also 
released on March 14. I would hope so. 
Taking action to defend human and civil 
rights is a time-honored tradition in this 
country.
The FBI also feels they are protecting 
human and civil rights.
We have to be careful to protect ev
eryones civil liberties, Killeen said. We 
do everything' to make sure that we 
dont encroach on anyones constitu
tional rights. Our paramount concern is 
to make sure that lives and property are 
protected.
One concern of the TMC was that its 
members of Middle Eastern descent were 
being particularly targeted.
During a time when religious differ
ences often lead to so much violence and 
war, we feel it is more important than ever 
to build relationships and solidarity across 
lines of religion, Vining stated.
Though an FBI document dated Novem
ber 29, 2002 mentioned specifically that a 
TMC event was held at the Islamic Center 
of Pittsburgh, gave .the home telephone 
number of the Muslim contact person for 
the event, and stated that there are more 
than a few Muslims and people of Middle 
Eastern descent present, Killeen main
tained the FBI does not target specific 
racial groups. .
[The FBI] cannot and will not inves
tigate because of someones religious or 
ethnic background, he said.
Protesters are also concerned that the 
FBI activity has been allowed to occur 
legally because of the October 2001 adop
tion of the Patriot Act.
It takes away more of our privacy 
each time its extended, Tarnauskas said. 
Without the Patriot Act, this FBI activity 
would be illegal.
Killeen pointed out that the Patriot Act 
was enacted to open channels between 
government agencies for information shar
ing and collaboration after 9/11. Many 
extremely important and helpful tools to 
help us gain information about possible
terrorism have been made possible by the 
Patriot Act, he said.
The FBI documents, dating back to 
2002, were released because of Freedom 
of Information Act requests by the TMC 
and the ACLU. Under any other circum
stances, the FBI would not have released 
those documents, Killeen said. Under that 
act, a group may request any documents 
on record which mention their organiza
tion in any way.
The TMC also suspects that an infor
mant actually affiliated with the FBI is 
posing as a member of the center, accord
ing to a March 14 letter from the TMC to 
friends and members of the organization. 
Killeen said he could not comment on this 
matter.
This spying is obviously a reaction to 
the good, hard work of Pittsburghers work
ing against the war, stated the March 14 
letter released by the TMC.
This is only the beginning of our 
efforts to shut down spying programs 
that target Americans and foreign 
nationals because of their political 
beliefs.

The 30th annual ACM Interna
tional Collegiate Programming 
Contest (ICPC), sponsored by 
IBM, has gathered the worlds 
brightest computer programming 
talent for an all-out battle of the 
brains in San Antonio, Texas, 
until Thursday.
More than 5600 teams, repre
senting 1733 universities from 
around the globe, participated 
in the regional competitions last 
fall. The top 83 teams earned cov
eted spots on the 2006 ACM-ICPC 
World Finals roster. Carnegie

Sometimes tech projects 
that make the largest impact 
dont revolve around high-end, 
new technology. The key is the 
approach taken to finding a solu
tion for the problem at hand, and 
being able to combine current 
technology with cutting-edge 
tech. Take Trinetra, for instance, 
a project that aims to develop 
cost-effective assistive technolo
gies to provide blind people with 
a greater degree of independence
majors Jeff Schroder, Evan Danaher, and Andrew Warshaver, and 
Charles Defazio, a senior com
puter science major. They are one 
of only 17 U.S. teams scheduled 
to compete in the World Finals.
Teams of three students will 
be challenged to use their pro
gramming skills and to rely on 
their mental endurance to solve 
eight to 10 highly complex, realworld problems  a semesters 
worth of curriculum  under 
a grueling five-hour deadline. 
Programmers must tackle algo
rithmic problems, such as de
termining the best travel routes 
to minimize traffic and ensure 
cost-effectiveness or developing 
a network strategy to determine 
the optimal placement of cell
in their daily activities. The San
skrit word Trinetra refers to the 
powerful third eye of the Hindu 
god Shiva.
Trinetra was started by Priya 
Narasimhan, an assistant profes
sor of electrical and computer en
gineering and computer science, 
who struck upon the idea for 
the project one day in December 
2004 when she noticed how dif
ficult it was for blind people to 
catch a bus on a snowy Pittsburgh 
evening. Graduate research stu
dents Patrick Lanigan, Aaron 
Paulos, and Andrew Williams all 
opted to work under Narasimphone service towers to cover as 
many customers as possible.
These problems are not classic 
algorithms, said Eugene Fink, a 
systems scientist in the School 
of Computer Science at Carnegie 
Mellon and one of two advisors 
to the team. All the textbooks in 
the world couldnt help you. The 
programmer must be innovative 
and creative. Its like solving re
search problems on the fly.
These are quite literally the 
hardest problems in the world, 
said Greg Kesden, a professor 
in the School of Computer Sci
ence and the other advisor to the 
team. You are solving problems 
of such high caliber, so it gives 
you a real-life application  the 
algorithmic part of computer prohan for Trinetra because of the 
passion they shared for working 
on a project that had the poten
tial to help the significant blind 
population of Pittsburgh.
Trinetra technology has just 
been installed in Carnegie Mel
lons campus store, Entropy, to 
make it easier for blind people to 
go grocery shopping. This assis
tive technology works as follows: 
Imagine a blind man walks into 
Entropy and wants to pick up a 
bottle of mustard. As he walks 
past one aisle to another, he uses 
a UPC-reading Baracoda pen
cil integrated with his phone to
gramming will not be as hard of a 
challenge in the future.
The finest problem-solvers 
from every continent will com
pete for bragging rights to the 
worlds smartest trophy dur
ing the ACM-ICPC World Finals, 
hosted by Baylor University. The 
team that solves the most prob
lems correctly in the least amount 
of time will emerge as the in
ternational champion, earning 
scholarships as well as awards 
from IBM.
Carnegie Mellon had a team 
make it to the world finals last 
year as well. They were ranked 
in the top 40, solving two out of 
the eight problems. Danaher was 
on the team last year; students 
are only allowed to compete in
scan the barcodes on the shelves 
under the products he browses. 
The Baracoda pencil contacts the 
UPC database through the Inter
net-enabled phone and identifies 
the product. The information 
returned to the phone is then 
read out by TALKS, software 
developed by Cingular that was 
installed in the phone.
Dan Rossi, mentor to the Trine
tra team, has been blind since he 
was seven; he is also the Oracle 
system administrator at Carnegie 
Mellon. A highly accomplished 
person in the area of technol
ogy, he was the guiding force for
the world finals twice, so this 
will be his and Defazios last 
chances to make Carnegie 
Mellon proud.
In order to prepare for the 
competition, the team met 
every Wednesday evening for 
five hours to practice problem 
sets. For the competition, the 
team could only use a single 
computer, so effective coop
eration and teamwork were 
crucial. The time we spend 
solving real-life problems 
will certainly help in other 
situations, said Danaher. The 
fact that we are using a single 
computer gives us a sense of 
teamwork and community.

Varibel: glasses that 
aid in hearing
A recent innovation from 
Delft University of Technology 
in the Netherlands unveiled a 
new hearing aid called Varibel 
on Friday. The device, which re
sembles a pair of glasses instead 
of a traditional in-ear aid, has a 
directional sensitivity of +8.2 
decibels, versus regular hearing 
aids maximum sensitivity of +4 
dB. Each leg of the glasses frame 
has a row of four tiny, intercon
nected microphones that inten
sify selected sounds coming from 
the front while simultaneously 
inhibiting the magnitude of the 
surrounding noise. This allows 
people with hearing deficiencies 
to hear things from the direction 
in which they are looking. More 
research needs to be done before 
the glasses are fully marketable.

Evolution of fish into 
animals explained
In Canadas Arctic region, 
about 900 kilometers from the 
North Pole, scientists have dis
covered the fossils of an ancient 
fish, a predator with sharp teeth 
and a crocodile-like head that 
they say is the missing link be
tween fish and limbed animals. 
The fossil fish, named Tiktaalik 
roseae, had a skull, neck, ribs 
and part of a fin that have been 
found in the earliest limbed ani
mals. Tiktaalik also resembled a 
fish due to its fins and scales. The 
fish fossils support the idea that 
the evolution from life in water 
to life on land occurred gradually 
in fish living in shallow water.
Scientists have known for 
nearly a century that fish evolved 
over millions of years into limbed 
animals called the tetrapods. 
However, there was a clear gap 
on the evolutionary tree between 
finned fish and tetrapods that, 
until now, had not been filled.

Medication gives un
anticipated results
According to the National In
stitute of Mental Health (NIMH), 
15 million Americans suffer 
from depression each year. Es
timates have the disease cost
ing the nation $83 billion yearly 
due to treatment costs as well as 
lost productivity due to absen
teeism and suicide. NIMH has 
funded a study examining the 
effectiveness of different treat
ment strategies for depression. 
The study focused on patients 
who did not become symptomfree after the initial medication 
was taken. The data revealed 
that half of the patients did not 
respond to any antidepressant, 
while two-thirds of the patients 
did not respond to the initial 
medication. However, one-third 
of these patients did respond to 
a second round of medication, 
and one-quarter responded to 
another type of antidepressant.

Telescopes search for 
extraterrestrial life
The Planetary Society has 
dedicated a brand new telescope 
at an observatory in Harvard, 
Mass., to search for light signals 
from alien civilizations. Such 
a search is known as Optical 
Search for Extraterrestrial Intellignce (OSETI). The telescope 
will conduct a year-long survey 
in which it will use a custommade camera to scan the portion 
of the Milky Way galaxy visible 
from the northern hemisphere. It 
will use a range of detectors that 
are sensitive to a billionth-of-asecond flash of light. Scientists 
will analyze the various pictures 
and may be able to find evidence 
of extraterrestrial life on other 
planets and solar systems.

How Things Work: Nootropics
William Nicoli
Every few weeks at Carnegie 
Mellon University, hell rolls 
around. It comes in the form of 
three exams, two problem sets, 
a research paper, and a group 
presentation  all in the span 
of five horrible days. At times 
like these, we all feel like we 
could use a boost to our brain
power. If it were as easy as a pill, 
would you do it?
Pharmaceutical companies 
know the potential of 
smart pills. These pills are 
collectively known as noo
tropics, meaning to act on 
the mind. Nootropics have 
a mind-boggling potential: 
increased cognitive abili
ties, improved memory recall, 
slowed aging of the brain, and 
even reversal of mentally de
generative diseases.
Chemists have a long way 
to go before such promises 
can be realized. Currently, no 
nootropics in the U.S. have 
been certified by the Food & 
Drug Administration as meet
ing their claims. Nevertheless, 
nootropics have found a niche 
acceptance among supporters 
of dietary and herbal supple
ments.
Nootropics work in a variety 
of ways, but they all involve 
interaction with the brain. 
The very first nootropic ever 
developed, Piracetam, works 
by optimizing transmission of 
neurons in the corpus callosum, 
the bridge connecting the two
'  -,
hemispheres of the brain. Many 
other smart pills function 
by affecting the bodys regula
tion of hormones, neurotrans
mitters, and other chemicals 
related to brain function. These 
nootropics work comparably to 
many antidepressants, which 
seek to balance chemical pro
duction in the brain.
The problem with the devel
opment of nootropics lies in 
the complexity of the brain. An 
average adult brain contains 
about 100 billion neurons. Each 
of these neurons averages 7000 
connections to other neurons, 
which allows for trillions of inCourtesy of sciweb.hfcc.edu/Biology/AP/134/lab
teractions.
Neuroscientists have made 
little progress understanding 
whether these interactions take 
place individually, in clusters, 
or in sweeping, brain-wide in
teractions. The brain is arguably 
the hardest-to-understand part 
of the body, and greater under
standing may take decades.
But progress is being made. 
In 2003, there were already 40 
nootropics in human trials. The 
largest demand for nootropic 
development is not among the 
stressed-out student demo
graphic, however. The real value 
of smart drugs lies with the el
derly. Nootropics have shown 
great promise in treating many 
mentally degenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimers, Parkin
sons, and senile dementia.
With the population of the el
derly steadily increasing in the 
United States, these conditions 
are on the rise. Alzheimers 
disease strikes nearly half of all 
people over 85 and 10 percent 
of those over 65. It is believed 
that a treatment that delays 
Alzheimers symptoms by five 
years could halve the occurence 
of the disease. Nootropics are 
being developed to do just that.
For now, the best recom
mendations for improving 
brain power are two famil
iar words: diet and exercise. 
Less heavy, fatty foods and 
more complex carbohydrates 
will contribute to a richer diet 
that keeps the mind alert and 
increases the flow of oxygen 
to the brain. Exercise can be 
consist of anything from brisk 
walking to dancing, swim
ming, and even sex  all will 
lead to more braininess. Stud
ies have also shown that adults 
with mentally stimulating jobs 
reduce the risk of degenerative 
diseases like Alzheimers later 
in life.

ECE professor develops techniques to aid

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN  APRIL 10, 2006
Carnegie Mellon group develops disability-friendly devices
Initiative to develop cost-effective assistive technologies for the blind using current technology
Assistant professor Priya Narasimhan, with graduate students Andrew Williams and Aaron Paulos, 
show off a demonstration of the shopping assistance device for the blind that they are developing.
TRINETRA, from A6
sible to browse products. I ask 
for what I need, and they take me 
to that product, and thats it. A 
device that can tell me what just 
about anything in the store actu
ally is is incredible.
There were many challenges 
faced by the Trinetra project. 
The major challenge for us is 
to keep the projects outcomes 
cost-effective. If we develop tech
nologies that end up increasing 
a blind persons cost of living 
significantly, we have really not 
lived up to our mission, Narasim
han said. The other challenge 
is to resist the temptation to 
add in bells and whistles which, 
while they might be attractive 
to look at, have limited practi
cal use to blind people. Since 
devices for the visually disabled 
are a niche market, they translate 
into high costs for the end user. 
Trinetras bag of gadgets includes 
mostly off-the-shelf items that 
people without disabilities use 
every day.
One of the unique features of 
Trinetra that sets it apart from
other ongoing projects is that it 
leverages available infrastruc
ture. The developers dont have 
to pay for the barcode (UPC) da
tabase; it is already available on 
the Internet. These design deci
sions help keep costs down for 
the project, so insufficient funds 
have not been a cause of worry so 
far for the Trinetra team. When 
the project began, Narasimhan 
took money off her payroll to keep 
the project going. Since then, the 
project has survived comfort
ably on the $7500 of funding it 
received from the Pennsylvania 
Cyber Security Commercializa
tion Initiative (PACSCI).
But theres more to worry 
about than just keeping costs low 
in a project like this. Narasim
han pointed out the privacy and 
safety issues that might arise for 
people using these services. Such 
issues and other more intricate 
ones have to be understood and 
analyzed simultaneously with 
the development of assistive 
technologies.
Trinetras next mission is to 
make Carnegie Mellons shuttle 
service friendlier to the visually
impaired by keeping them in
formed of arrival times. The 
phone is again the preferred 
medium of communication, this 
time using text messages. To 
start things off, Narasimhan had 
her research students go around 
and try to get a feel of the shuttle 
service. The project might also 
end up being useful for students 
using the service late at night.
So what keeps the Trinetra 
team going? The team designed, 
developed, and tested a concept 
that not only works,-but is com
pletely useful, said Rossi. This 
is not a sensor net vest of pager 
motors and scanning hats that 
are a neat idea, but not practical 
in the least. The Trinetra sys
tem is practical and useful and 
I commend the team on their 
work.
The future looks bright for the 
Trinetra team. Narasimhan said, 
My aim is for Trinetra to become 
one of the research thrusts of my 
research group, so that we can 
explore the application of em
bedded, distributed technologies 
to improve the quality of life for 
disabled people.
Programmers compete internationally
CONTEST, from A6
The Carnegie Mellon pro
grammers competing in the 
contest will reap great benefits. 
From my experience, real-life 
problems produce very good 
programmers and researchers. 
This sort of training improves 
peoples capabilities of incredi
ble magnitude, Fink said. This 
is the first step to greatness.
The Dragons have been 
very satisfied with the dedica
tion and guidance they have 
received from their advisors. 
Each has added to the teams 
preparation and success in a 
unique way. Eugene is smart 
with algorithms because of all 
his research experience, said 
Schroder. Kesden is good at 
hacking. He makes everything 
work  hes good at solving 
problems without well-defined 
borders.
Since the ICPC began 30 
years ago, the world of technol
ogy has evolved significantly: 
The personal computer is no
longer a costly machine that 
uses an eight-inch floppy disk 
to store information, and now 
portable laptops with wireless 
Internet capabilities are com
monplace. This contest gives 
young computer programmers 
experience with the worlds 
most advanced technology, an 
experience that will pave their 
developing career paths.
This event offers collegiate 
programmers the opportunity 
to become familiar with Java, 
Linux, Eclipse, and other 
open computing platforms 
being adopted by industries 
around the world, said Doug 
Heintzman, a director of 
strategy at IBM Software Group 
and sponsorship executive of 
the ICPC. Open source and 
open standards are driving the 
next great innovations in the 
industry, and this contest chal
lenges students who will be 
responsible for that innovation 
for decades to come.
IBMs sponsorship of the 
ACM-ICPC is an important com
ponent of the companys many 
academic initiatives, designed 
to stimulate open-source pro
gramming skills to develop a 
more competitive IT workforce 
capable of driving global inno
vation and economic growth. 
IBM has significantly aided in 
the competitions popularity. 
Contest participation has in
creased seven-fold since IBM 
began its sponsorship in 1997.
This competition has at
tracted the most dedicated, 
computer-loving students that 
universities have to offer. There 
is a reason we are here. In real
ity, these are the best, brightest, 
most agile students we have, 
Kesden said. You always hear 
about sports  basketball, 
soccer, and football athletes 
being in it for the game. Well, 
them [the Dragons team], they 
are here for the fun of the game 
too  for computer science.

Dermabond: surgical superglue
Courtesy of www.reviewjournal.com
Dermabond is a cyanoacrylate glue that reacts with the moisture on skin. It aids in wound healing.
bySimran Grover
Junior Staffwriter 
& Hanadie Yousef
Science & Technology Editor
In the past, people who have 
been seriously wounded were 
given stitches that required 
surgery and often left unat
tractive scars. Now, an inno
vative solution has been de
veloped to replace traditional 
stitches with a product known 
as Dermabond. Dermabond is 
a liquid skin adhesive designed 
to repair lacerations and close 
surgical incisions. With a com
position similar to superglue, it 
effectively seals the skin quickly 
and painlessly.
Dermabond contains the com
pound 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, 
an acrylic resin. Cyanoacrylate 
adhesives are famous for in
stant attachment because of 
their hydrophilic nature. The 
compound reacts with water to 
form a strong, flexible bond. It 
does this by polymerizing and 
rapidly creating long, strong 
chains in the presence of mois
ture on the skins surface.
Uses for cyanoacrylate glues 
in medicine have been explored 
since the early 1960s. Eastman 
Kodak and Ethicon, under the 
leadership of Harry Coover of 
Kodak Laboratories, were the 
first companies to consider
whether the glues could join hu
man tissues together injury or 
surgery. In 1964, Eastman Ko
dak submitted an application to 
use cyanoacrylate glues to seal 
wounds to the United States 
Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA).
In 1966, Kodak Laboratories 
was given a chance to test the 
glue in Vietnam. The cyanoac
rylate glue was administered 
by a specially trained surgical 
team, with significant results 
for wounded patients. The 
biggest problem they had was 
stopping the bleeding so they 
could get the patient back to the 
hospital; many of them bled to 
death, Coover said in a King
sport [Tenn.] Times-News re
port. Medical officials sprayed 
the substance on wounds, which 
closed the opening and allowed 
the wounded sufficient time to 
reach the hospital.
Dermabond offers many ad
vantages: The need for stitches 
is eliminated, and incisions can 
be closed in three-quarters of 
the time. The strong yet flexible 
bond seals out harmful bacte
ria and disappears naturally 
as the opening heals. There is 
no need for anesthesia before 
application of the glue, nor for 
bandages after. It is gentle and 
more comfortable; Dermabond 
does not scar the skin as stitches 
do. This works well for sensitive
areas on the face, especially 
near the eyes.
Phil Campbell, a professor 
of biology at Carnegie Mel
lon, has a different opinion 
about Dermabonds signifi
cance. Its basically superglue 
packaged in a sterile envi
ronment, said Campbell. He 
suggested using fibrin glue as 
an alternative because it may 
be a better solution due to its 
composition of proteins and 
body-friendly materials. How
ever, there is always a chance 
of an unfavorable reaction 
between the proteins and the 
persons body.
Dermabond cannot be used 
effectively on jagged and wide 
cuts or in areas of increased 
stretching or tension; it is 
harder to keep the skin to
gether when applying the glue. 
If the skin is not kept together, 
Dermabond cannot form a bond 
between the skin.
Cyanoacrylate glues also 
are used in medicine for or
thopedic surgery, dental and 
oral medicine (marketed as 
Soothe-n-Seal), veterinary 
medicine (Nexaband), and for 
home use (as Band-Aid Brand 
Liquid Bandage). It also has 
been explored as a potential 
treatment for emphysema, 
where it can be used to seal off 
diseased lung passages without 
the need for invasive surgery.

Faculty Senate takes a stand
Carnegie Mellon faculty refuse to accept conservative attack on academia
The Tartan commends and thanks the 
Faculty Senate for taking an uncompro
mising stance against the influence of 
conservative activist David Horowitz in 
Pennsylvania colleges and universities.
As weve reported before, last summer 
the Pennsylvania legislature approved 
a resolution  H.R. 177  that would 
investigate political bias in our states 
colleges. H.R. 177 (and similar legisla
tion) comes directly out of Horowitzs 
Academic Bill of Rights, which is an 
attempt to loosen a supposed liberal 
stranglehold on institutions of higher 
education.
In June, a committee approved by 
the Pennsylvania legislature will return 
with its findings on whether or not the 
states schools are politically biased. And 
when they do, the members of Carnegie 
Mellons Faculty Senate will issue press 
releases protesting the governments 
influence on colleges, both public and 
private.
Right now the committee cannot touch 
Carnegie Mellon. But it can touch the 
University of Pittsburgh and other public 
schools, some of which Carnegie Mellon 
professors have close ties to. Drama 
professor Michael Chemers, who ap
peared before the Faculty Senate last 
week to propose a protest of the General 
Assemblys committee, remarked, I col
laborate with professors from Pitt. If they 
feel intimidated, that changes my work 
relationship with them.
Chemers brought before the Faculty 
Senate a resolution that will position 
Carnegie Mellon against the commit
tee to assess bias on state campuses. 
Chemers said that a protest letter will be 
sent to major publications locally to state 
clearly that Carnegie Mellon is against 
the spirit of the committee.
The Faculty Senate should be ap
plauded for its efforts to protest the 
committee and the spirit behind it. Faculty 
Senate declares that it stands in solidar
ity with its colleagues in Pennsylvania 
higher education and opposes H.R. 177 
in the strongest possible terms as an at
tempt to politicize hiring processes and 
professorial review.
The Faculty Senates resolution steps 
in the right direction, especially in its 
attempts to make its protest of H.R. 177 
public.
We asked Chemers what more could be 
done to combat H.R. 177 and Horowitzs 
Academic Bill of Rights. He reacted 
strongly: I think its a tremendous waste 
of time to even have to do this [speak 
against H.R. 177].... Im angry that I 
even have to say ... that this is wrong. 
Chemers added that the Faculty Senate 
voted overwhelmingly to protest the res
olution.
As Chemers points out, measures to 
prevent students from being unfairly 
treated on any grounds  including po
litical leaning  are already in place. 
Any jurisdiction the state would have 
over professors who allegedly misgrade 
students on such grounds would be re
dundant. The Faculty Senate takes the 
correct approach by stating loudly and 
clearly that such state interference in the 
college system is unwarranted.
We are not saying that theres no 
ideological bias or that there is, said 
Chemers of the resolution the Faculty 
Senate passed. And we are not saying 
that if it does exist it is or is not harmful. 
What we are saying is that oversight of 
these issues belongs in the institution 
and not the government.
Now, the suspisciously redundant lan
guage of the Academic Bill of Rights has 
shown up in the United States Congress, 
in Section 103 of House Resolution 609. 
If it passes, academias traditional  and 
legitimate  liberalism could come un
der fire nationwide.
If only the state government could see 
that wisdom, instead of trying to flush 
out this alleged bias with its redundant 
committees. Then and only then could 
we feel that Horowitz-type agendas were 
not frighteningly near.
Scogin mindful of our architectural history
Architect of Gates Center for Computer Science will consider our unique aesthetic
Its an exciting time to be a student 
here at Carnegie Mellon. Our campus is 
undergoing the most changes its seen 
since the construction of the University 
Center, Purnell, and Newell-Simon Hall. 
Preliminary plans for the new Gates 
Center for. Computer Science were offi: 
daily unveiled last week, and much of 
the campus community is still debating 
whether or not the building will fit in on 
campus. Mack Scogin, the head archi
tect on the project, is assuring everyone 
that the building fits into the vision of 
Henry Hornbostel, our campuss origi
nal architect.
It is truly a breath of fresh air that the 
aesthetics of our campus are being re
spected. Scogin and his firm have clearly 
considered what the Gates Center will 
say about Carnegie Mellon and the Uni
versitys mission, and they have consid
ered how everyone else will perceive it.
Hornbostel, and campus architects af
ter him, all created master plans for how 
Carnegie Mellons campus would look 
as it grew and changed over the years. 
A poster with the most recent master 
plan is on display on a bulletin board in 
the basement of the University Center, 
and even though it predates the Gates 
Center, one can easily see how the new 
project would fit in.
What does not fit in, however, is the 
onslaught of art installations that has 
hit campus recently. The Kraus Campo 
is an eyesore, but at least it cant be seen 
unless you actually go up and stand on 
it. The snowman in the corner of the 
Mall, next to Doherty Hall, looks ridic
ulous, but its small enough that most 
people will pass it by without even a sec
ond glance. The art is spreading, though, 
and work has begun on the placement of 
two more sculptures on campus  sculp
tures that have already attracted plenty 
of legitimate scrutiny.
The opinions of The Tartan and the 
campus at large regarding the place
ment of Jonathan Borofskys Walking to 
the Sky are extremely played out at this 
point. It has been at the forefront of stu
dent minds for weeks, and the fresh dirt 
piling up on the Cut is a daily reminder 
of the campuss newest eyesore.
How can Mack Scogin and his firm, 
which have no prior relationship with 
Carnegie Mellon, take into account the 
nuances of our Universitys campus and 
create a massive structure that makes a 
statement while still complementing the 
land around it, but many people who 
are all directly connected to the Univer
sity can miss the mark so completely? 
That  more than Will it fit in?  is 
the question this community should be 
asking.
Increasingly Marxist Latin 
America poses threat to U.S.
Benjamin Hackett
Latin America is taking a hard turn to 
the left. For those that thought the end 
of the Cold War meant a spreading of 
capitalist values and peace throughout 
the western hemisphere, it is now time 
to wake up.
Crime is on the rise in Marxist 
Venezuela. President Hugo Chvezs 
numerous speeches have encouraged 
criminals to carry out attacks on the 
Venezuelan upper-middle and upper 
classes. Chvez dreams of revolution, 
and has even even sweet-talked lead
ers in Moscow and Beijing. The New 
York Times reported that the Center of 
Economic Investigations, an economic 
consulting firm in Caracas, issued a 
study recently that said Mr. Chvez 
had spent more than $25 billion abroad 
since taking office in 1999, about $3.6 
billion a year.
The New York Times also reported, 
There is little doubt, however, that the 
spending has won Mr. Chvez stature 
and support abroad. For Argentina, the 
debt purchases helped President Nstor 
Kirchner, Venezuelas left-leaning ally, 
to pay off that countrys $9.8 billion debt 
to the International Monetary Fund, 
ending Argentinas stormy relationship 
with the group. In Cuba, Venezuela has 
supplied nearly 100,000 barrels of cutrate oil per day  a deal Cuba repays 
with doctors and other services  mak
ing Mr. Chvez a benefactor on par with 
the Soviet Union, which once bank
rolled Castros economy. If partnering 
up with Castro is not a direct declara
tion of misguided principles, what is?
Worse still, Chvez is nationalizing 
every business within his reach, most 
recently oil. In an attack on capital
ism and free markets, Chvez seized 
oil fields from two international com
panies. Oil fields belonging to Frances 
Total SA and Italys Eni SpA were seized 
when the companies refused to meet 
demands that the operations of their 
fields be turned over to Petroleos de 
Venezuela SA, the Venezuelan state oil 
company. Business Week reported that 
President Hugo Chvez has tightened 
his grip on Venezuelas energy re
sources, following through on threats 
to punish international companies 
that resist government control of the 
nations oil fields.
The march to the left does not stop 
in Venezuela. In Peru, Chvez clone 01- 
lanta Hmala is the leading candidate. 
Hmala, an army officer, is an openly 
anti-free-market candidate that pub
licly led a military rebellion. After his 
2000 arrest and subsequent release, 
Hmala joined his father Isaac and his 
brother Antauro in an anti-corruption, 
anti-free market, anti-imperialist and 
copper-skin color supremacy crusade, 
reports the Miami Herald.
In a stunning show of short-term 
ignorance, Hmala is against globalization and applauds efforts to nation
alize most industry. Of course, global
ization has lifted millions of the worlds 
poor out of poverty in Latin America 
and other areas of the world. Since ig
norance is bliss, is it any wonder why 
Chavez openly endorses Humala?
Turning to Bolivia, one can see the 
regime of populist Marxist Evo Morales. 
Generally, Morales is viewed more fa
vorably than Chavez, but Morales still 
has heavily leftward leanings. He, too, 
wishes to nationalize much of business 
within the country and is for highef 
taxes and protectionism.
Continuing on our fun Marxist tour 
of Latin America, we stop in our be
loved neighbor to the south, Mexico. 
Here, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 
of the Democratic Revolution Party, is 
leading the polls in the current presi1 
dential race. There are allegations  all 
but 100 percent proven  tying Lopez 
Obradors party to Chavez. Supporters 
of Chavez are among the largest backers 
of Lopez Obrador. Rumors continue to 
persist that Chavez himself has helped 
fund Lopez Obradors campaign.
Simply think about the implications 
of an anti-free-market president in 
Mexico. The current Mexican policies 
are harmful enough to the American 
economy, flooding the United States 
with unskilled workers that end up 
on the taxpayers backs. Now imag
ine a Mexico where leftist and Marxist 
themes dominate the political debate. 
The entire population of Mexico could 
view itself as the downtrodden masses 
and set policies designed to feed off of 
the American taxpayers contributions. 
Sharing a border with an up-and-coming Mexico has proven difficult enough; 
imagine a scenario with Mexico be
coming overtly anti-capitalist. Mexico 
is just free of the 71-year rule of the 
totalitarian Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, a party connected to drug traf
ficking. Let us hope Mexicans are astute 
enough not to switch from one totalitar
ian regime to another.
The issue is not that Latin America 
is shifting leftward, but rather the im
plications of this to the United States. 
The U.S. gets over 4 million barrels of 
oil a day from Venezuela and Mexico,  
huge percentage of our daily consump
tion. The porous border with Mexico 
would not benefit from an ultra-leftist 
leader, a leader who openly denounces 
the United States supposedly keeping 
Mexicans out.
Latin America is an area with promis
ing growth potential, yet investors are 
scared away due to the regions political 
makeup. As history has always shown, 
populist regimes worsen living condi
tions, and Marxism traditionally fails. 
Hopefully, fewer Latin Americans will 
be killed in this, the beginning of Marx
isms next public failing.

Instant win games could

It might not seem like a big deal 
to most people, but whenever I buy a

the strategically placed vending ma

Back in the days when instant win

THE TARTAN  APRIL 10, 2006
Weve all heard it: At Carnegie Mellon, the odds are good but the goods are odd. That got us wondering:
Whats your weirdest Carnegie Mellon dating experience?A PERSONS OPINION
Compiled by Noah Lorang and Olga Stradina
Fieldhouse 
to be built 
on campus?
Tom Sabram
This past week, there were 
two open discussions with 
the architect of the new Gates 
Center for Computer Science, 
and there will be another on 
April 20. There are also plans for 
a new athletic fieldhouse.
On March 18, every student 
received an e-mail from Official 
Communications. The e-mail 
contained a link to a survey that 
had questions about what stu
dents would like to see in the 
new fieldhouse and how fre
quently they would use certain 
features. Despite the mislead
ing subject line of the e-mail 
(University Health & Wellness 
Survey), the survey has had an 
amazing response rate. The data 
from the survey, which show 
that students want more bas
ketball and racquetball courts, 
have been passed along to the 
architecture firm to help them 
design the building.
The architecture firm' also 
had an opportunity to meet with 
several different groups when 
it came to campus at the end 
of March. These groups had 
smaller working group meetings 
in which they discussed their 
desired space in the new build
ing. This will help the architects 
bring a better plan back to cam
pus when they return in the next 
week or so.
Two questions remain: Where 
will it go, and when will it be 
built? Since the size of the new 
building is about that of the 
current Skibo Gym, there are 
few places it could actually fit. 
The proposed locations now are 
where Skibo is currently; on the 
intramural fields; around the ten
nis courts; or in the Morewood 
parking lot, if the master plan 
comes to fruition. It is important 
to remember that these spots 
have only been mentioned. It is 
possible that none of them will 
be used for the fieldhouse.
Finally, the question of how 
to finance the building seems to 
be the limiting factor. Because 
Carnegie Mellon has a smaller 
endowment than many of its 
peer institutions, the school is 
going to have to rely on fund
raising campaigns prior to the 
construction of the highly de
sired fieldhouse. I would love to 
see a large donation in the near 
future, but would also like to 
remind students to consider giv
ing money back to the University 
when they graduate to help build 
the fieldhouse. If you have ever 
exercised on campus, you have 
noticed the condition and the 
limited number of facilities.
Once constructed, this build
ing will help improve campus 
life and allow the school to focus 
on other problem areas.
Tom Sabram (sbp(g)J is look
ing forward to seeing how the 
fieldhouse turns out and will be 
jealous of everyone who will have 
a chance to use it.

I was applying for a job re
cently (and by job I mean a 
non-paying, just-for-the-experience internship), and one part 
of the application required me to 
write a short report on any federal 
program. I chose the National 
Endowment for the Arts (NEA). 
It may not be as sexy as NASA 
or as chic as the Environmental 
Protection Agency, but its been 
with us for our whole lives, hid
ing in the background, quietly 
and happily feeding us morsels 
of culture and making our society 
more well-rounded. Over the past 
decade and a half, Congress has 
noticed the NEAs good works 
and rewarded it by slashing its 
budget to levels unseen since the 
early 1980s.
Just in case you have never 
heard of the NEA: It was created 
in the 1960s, when many impor
tant artistic and cultural events 
were limited to major cities, the 
only places where there was ad
equate financial support. Outside 
of these large areas, there was 
simply not enough money to pro
duce or broadcast plays, concerts, 
ballets, and other types of art. For 
many amateur poets and writ
ers outside of big cities, it was 
impossible to earn a living. The 
National Endowment has helped 
create local and regional arts pro
grams and grants fellowships to 
promising young authors across 
the nation.
Some of the NEAs greatest 
triumphs are the television pro
grams it funds on the Public 
Broadcasting Service. Listen 
carefully at the end of a PBS 
program and you may hear the 
National Endowment for the 
Arts mentioned somewhere 
between funding provided 
by the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting and viewers like 
you. The educational and en
tertainment value of many PBS 
programs far exceeds anything 
else offered on commercial tele
vision, yet without the National 
Endowment for the Arts, such 
programming would not have 
nearly enough financial support.
Unfortunately, the National 
Endowment made a slight mis
take in the late 80s  it started 
supporting avante-garde art.
that decides to use this type of campaign 
wastes effort on a useless promotional ploy 
that reaches only a limited number of their 
customers.
The only real remedy to this issue is 
to put the instant back in the instant 
win promotion concept. If youre going 
to refer to something as an instant win 
game, then for the love of all things that 
are good and pure, make it so that people 
know immediately whether or not they 
are a winner or a loser. Even if the game 
piece contains the simple message Sorry, 
please try again, at least they will thank 
you for being direct. They will thank you 
for telling them the truth. But most of all, 
they will thank you for not wasting their 
precious time.
Since time is money, with that extra 
time they save by not going on a wild goose 
chase, they might even go buy another 
bottle or two of your companys product.
Mercy Chang (mercyc@) is a junior eco
nomics major. She welcomes all thoughtful 
responses.
Among the thousands of writers 
and budding artists it helped, 
among the musicians, the jazz 
masters, the radio stations, and 
the television programs, it also 
funded a cohort of controversial 
artists including Robert Clark 
Young, Andres Serrano, and 
Robert Mapplethorpe. Young is 
famous for his novels about alco
holism, abuse of power, and cor
ruption in American life. Serrano 
came under attack in the cul
ture wars of the early 90s for his 
Piss Christ, a crucifix steeped 
in urine.
And Mapplethorpe? Well, hes 
like Anne Geddes, except instead 
of babies wearing flower suits, he 
photographs naked men wearing 
other men.
So it would appear that the 
NEA is anti-American, antiChristian, and pro-ambiguously 
gay duos. Conservatives in the 
late 80s and early 90s certainly 
thought so. When the conserva
tive American Family Association 
(AFA) got wind of the NEAs fund
ing choices, it pushed for the NEA 
to be punished. The AFA conve
niently forgot about the NEAs 
support of hundreds of regional 
and local theater programs. It 
chose to ignore the NEAs up
lifting and educational television 
and radio programs. It forgot that 
the NEAs foremost goal is to fos
ter American culture and make 
it accessible to everyone in the 
country.
The conflict over the NEA 
throughout the 90s had farreaching consequences. In 1996, 
the Republican Congress slashed 
the NEAs budget by about 40 
percent from $162 million to $99 
million. Congressional conser
vatives, along with groups like 
the AFA, wanted to abolish the 
National Endowment entirely. In 
1998, the Supreme Court decided 
in favor of a law that required the 
NEA to take decency into account 
when considering funding. The 
logic there: People should not be 
forced to pay their hard-earned 
tax money to support art they 
find offensive.
Its funny; the same conserva
tives that argued people should 
not be forced to support art they 
do not approve of havent thought 
twice that people who dont sup
port the war in Iraq are forced to 
pay for it.
The cost to . taxpayers of the 
controversial art shows: a few 
hundred thousand dollars. The
wild goose chase that more often than not 
proves fruitless.
What is most disheartening is that this 
new type of instant win promotion de
prives consumers of the euphoric rush one 
gets from being an instant winner. Of 
course, in most cases the winner doesnt 
get much beyond a free bottle of soda. But 
still, those three seconds in which a person 
experiences instant-win gratification may 
be exactly what he or she needed to get 
through a difficult day filled with stress 
and frustration.
Imagine how different the story of 
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would 
have been had Willy Wonka decided to 
replace the Golden Tickets with pieces 
of ordinary paper containing long alpha
numeric codes that made no sense to the 
undiscerning chocolate eater. Instead of 
carefully unwrapping a Wonka bar, hoping 
to catch a glimpse of something golden 
inside, the whole process would have been 
quite different.
Based on what we know about Charlie 
Bucket and his familys limited financial
circumstances, he may not have had access 
to a computer. Even if the slip of paper con
tained within his bar o chocolate had the 
winning code, chances are Charlie would 
have just given up on the whole ordeal. 
Unless we had the emotional intelligence 
of a rhinoceros, we couldnt possibly let 
such a tragedy happen, could we?
What these marketers seem not to real
ize is that people are lazy. They dont want 
to go through the hassle of saving a bottle 
cap, going online, registering, and typing 
in a unique code just for a chance to win. 
Since most people just assume that their 
chances of instantly winning something 
are slim, they see no point in putting in 
so much effort into an endeavor that will 
most likely result in nothing.
Nowadays, everyone is preoccupied with 
careers, families, and friends, so when 
companies decide to send their custom
ers looking for the Loch Ness monster, 
everyone loses. The customer who has the 
bottle cap containing the winning code 
forgoes his or her prize because of laziness 
or time constraints, while the company
cost of the war in Iraq: over 
billion. Punishing the organiza
tion that brought you the first 
National Symposium on Access 
to Cultural Programs for disabled 
and older individuals: priceless.
But why should we care? This 
all happened a decade ago. Well, 
not exactly. Even though the 
funding level increased to $124 
million in 2006, Congress has still 
enacted rescissions (fancy talk 
for cuts) in the NEA budget an
nually since 1999. The marginal 
increases in the NEAs budget 
are mainly due to inflation, 
non-federal gifts, and transfers 
between different federal agen
cies. The NEAs current funding 
level now is nowhere near the 
level it was before the scandals 
of the past two decades.
But why? The NEA has re
formed its dastardly ways. It no 
longer funds individual artists, 
and it prides itself on maintain
ing decency. Is quality radio,
television, theater, poetry, and 
literature only worth a hundred 
million dollars? I do not propose 
that the government allocate to 
the NEA the billions it does to de
fense, but it should demonstrate 
a stronger commitment to the 
massive sector of our culture that 
the NEA supports. Society as a 
whole often views the arts as an 
extra. Art and music programs, 
for example, are the first targeted 
cuts at schools when money runs 
short, and so it goes on a national 
level. When the national budget 
is developed, it is too often the 
NEA that has to pinch its pen
nies to keep its many endeavors 
afloat.
What the National Endowment 
does is admirable and would be 
no matter what amount of money 
it had to distribute. The amount 
the NEA receives now, however, 
even after it has changed to ap
pease opponents, is a slap in the 
face.

THE TARTAN  APRIL 10, 2006Ail
Juice, drugs, and baseball
Doug Fricker
On March 30, Major League 
Baseball (MLB) launched its 
probe into steroid use in base
ball over the past 10 to 15 years. 
MLB commissioner Bud Selig 
appointed former U.S. Senator 
George Mitchell to head up the 
investigation, whose mission is 
to uncover who used what and 
where and when they used it. 
This comes in the wake of the 
publishing of Game of Shadows 
by Mark Fainaru-Wada and 
Lance Williams, a book that de
tails Barry Bonds alleged ste
roid use.
Unfortunately for everyone 
involved, this probe will cause 
more problems than it will solve. 
Why was this investigation not 
started 10 or 15 years ago? This 
steroid problem began in the 
early 1990s, yet its scope is not 
known even up through the 
present. Mark McGwire (co-star 
of the historic 1998 home run 
race) took androstenedione, an 
unregulated food additive that 
is banned in the Olympics, the 
NCAA, and the NFL, but not in 
MLB.
Only now are we trying to 
uncover the truth of the past, 
and what about possible future 
problems, such as use of hu
man growth hormone or blood 
doping? A present and future 
approach, rather than an inves
tigation into the past, is what is 
needed.
What are the real motives 
behind this investigation? Selig 
denied that the reason for this 
probe is that Bonds is closing 
in on the major-league home 
run record of 755 held by Hank 
Aaron, but it is not hard to read 
between the lines. If Bonds 
passes Aaron amidst all the con
troversy and accusations, Selig 
will be put in a tough position 
on whether to honor Bonds 
achievements.
Another question lies in what 
exactly Selig hopes to accom
plish. He recently said, The 
goal here is to determine facts, 
not engage in supposition, spec
ulation, rumor, or innuendo. 
Once the facts are found, even if 
players used steroids, it will be

San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds is closing in on Hank Aarons 
home run record. Is his success due purely to steroids?
hard to penalize them for their 
actions occurring before the ste
roids ban.
In addition, players were not 
given formal drug tests until 
2003, and no penalties were en
acted until the following year. 
The current policy is a 50-game 
suspension for the first positive 
test, a 100-game suspension 
for the next, and a lifetime ban 
for the third. This policy seems 
to solve potential future prob
lems of steroid use, but it has 
no provision for actions to take 
when players are charged with 
using steroids in books, when 
people testify that the players 
used them, or when after-thefact evidence is uncovered.
If, and when, this investiga
tion finds dirt on players, it will 
tarnish the athletes reputations 
and the game of baseball as a 
whole. This is all because these 
players were doing something 
that officially was not breaking 
any rules and that they felt they 
had to do to compete.
I am not condoning steroid 
use here, but in sports, when 
athletes are looking for every 
edge they can get and there is 
pressure coming from every di
rection for them to excel at the 
highest level possible  and 
there is no suspension policy in 
place  you begin to see how
they could end up making the 
wrong decision.
Also, how do you deal with 
statistics from the past decade? 
You cannot just isolate and re
move the cheaters from the rest, 
seeing as all statistics are inter
connected. You would basically 
just need to throw out all the 
statistics from the past decade to 
solve that, but then what about 
the period in which spitballs 
were not banned from being 
thrown by pitchers? I guess you 
would need to throw out these 
stats, too, since pitchers were 
cheating then. There is also the 
dead ball era (1900-1919) 
when baseballs were not wound 
as tight as they are now, so the 
ball was not as juiced as it is in 
todays game.
Commissioner Seligs inten
tions are good, but the results, 
unfortunately, will not be. More 
harm than good will come out of 
this investigation, as it will cre
ate more problems than it will 
solve. Seligs goal here is to de
termine the facts about steroids 
in baseball, but what happens 
when he gets these facts? Seligs 
, best option would be to focus 
on the future and to stop any 
further performance-enhancing 
drug use. He will not be able to 
change the past, so he might as 
well just leave it alone.

Organizations bring athletes together
ATHLETICS, from A12
said. Through school events, the 
Carnegie Clan works to get people 
actively involved with athletics. 
For example, they sponsor the 
Chili Cook-Off each year at the 
Homecoming football game. The 
Chili Cook-Off usually has about 
20-30 entries, with celebrity 
judges such as President Cohon 
to choose the best recipe.
The Carnegie Clan plans to 
hold an arm-wrestling competi
tion and an eating contest on 
April 29 as a University Center 
late-night program.
The organization is open to 
spirited students from outside the 
athletic program as well. Anyone 
can join, Metier said. We love 
people to come to our meetings. 
Especially the people who are 
not athletes, because its easier to 
find out from them what will get 
people to games. I feel like sports 
has always been a big part of 
Carnegie Mellon; its just that the 
general population doesnt know 
about it, and so we are trying to 
raise awareness.
The Carnegie Clan sponsored a 
dunk tank on Midway at Carnival 
last year, where attendees could
pay to dunk some of Carnegie 
Mellons athletes. The activ
ity raised $1000 for the Special 
Olympics. This year, the Carnegie 
Clan will again have a dunk tank 
on Midway but a portion of its 
earnings will go to the new stu
dent-run organization SAVE.
SAVE was formed this year 
by sophomore business majors 
Trent Sisson and Michael Reggie. 
The goal of this organization is 
to reach out to the Pittsburgh 
community and provide sports 
equipment and day camps for 
underprivileged grade-school 
children in the area.
We were just talking about 
how we wanted to do something 
for the community and establish 
a student group where we could 
hold programs and things that 
we were actually interested in, 
Sisson said.
On Saturday, SAVE plans to 
hold a soccer day camp to teach 
kids the basic ideas and skills of 
soccer. Staff members from the 
Boys and Girls Club will help run 
the event, along with some var
sity soccer players from Carnegie 
Mellon and the members of SAVE. 
About 40 to 50 kids are expected 
to come to this event.
Were trying to get to the point 
where we can provide the camp 
for kids that dont have all the op
tions that they need, Sisson said. 
Were starting with the Boys and 
Girls Club and we are trying to 
connect to various schools or
ganizations  whatever we can 
connect to  but this is just our 
starting point.
So far, SAVE officially has 
about 15 members. Although 
SAVE works closely with the 
Boys and Girls Club, most of their 
funds are raised through their 
own means. Their goals for now 
are to establish their program the 
in Pittsburgh community.
My ultimate goal would be 
for people or a program to come 
to us, and they could provide the 
players to run events, and we 
would just take care of everything 
else, Sisson said. That would be 
ideal if we could do that. Well see 
if we can get to that point.
If you are interested in joining the 
Carnegie Clan, e-mail Rory Kaclik 
at rkaclik@andrew.cmu.edu. If 
you have any interest in joining 
or volunteering for SAVE, contact

we hope to be for the conference 
championships.

happens, and when that happens 
you shoot really low, said senior 
A.J. Straub, who, while paired 
with Fillari, carded three birdies 
of his own. His play was the dif
ference. We all played solid. One 
low score like that turns a close 
match into a win for whoever gets 
the low score.
Senior Matt Simone paced 
the Tartans low scoring with a 
74, four over par at the Verona 
course.
Overall I was pretty happy with 
how I played, said Simone, who 
shot two birdie^ and an eagle.
Number eight [I] hit a big 
drive on the par five ... and stuck 
a seven-iron to like three feet and 
made the putt for eagle. 
First-year Alex Timmons, the 
teams other long hitter, also 
recorded two birdies to fire a fiveover 75 and a tie for fourth place.
Following a shaky beginning 
due to his short game, Timmons 
began his recovery on his sixth 
hole of the shotgun start.
I actually made a pretty long 
putt for that day anyway. I made 
like a 20-footer for birdie a lot of 
break between right to left. So 
that kind of got me confidencewise going, Timmons said. I 
was four over at that point, and I 
finished the day at five over, and 
that was only my sixth hole. That 
was probably a big putt because I 
hadnt been putting well all day. 
Sophomore Blake Darby also 
gained confidence and momen
tum from his short game. After
sinking a 40-foot putt for birdie 
on his second hole, Darby, who 
finished the day with a fiveover 75, reached the par-three 
and tapped in a four-footer for 
back-to-back birdies. Sophomore 
Howard Smiths 76 rounded out 
the scoring for the Tartans first 
squad, while first-year Joshua 
Chen fired a 75 to lead the Tartan
this miraculous shot and end up 
costing your team maybe three or 
four strokes.
Simone agreed. I dont think 
there are too many of us who 
try to pull off hero shots as far as 
that goes, he said. So I think we 
really understand that we have 
a lot of solid guys. We dont nec
essarily have to go low to put
Were playing with our head and 
understandingthatitsanindividual 
game but its a team game too.
Rich Erdelyi
B team. Senior Randahl Matsuno 
and junior Aanand Radia com
pleted the sub-80 scoring with 77 
and 79, respectively.
When you have your B team' 
post three scores in the 70s, its 
just terrific. They had a very nice 
day, Erdelyi said. The teams 
depth and growing confidence 
are only part of the reason for the 
Tartans string of four consecutive 
top-three finishes.
I think right now were playing 
intelligently, Erdelyi said. Were 
playing with our head and under
standing that its an individual 
game but its a team game too. 
You cant sacrifice yourself and 
say, Im going to try to pull off
together a good team score. If we 
have a bad hole we just got to put 
it out of our minds and know that 
everyone else is most likely play
ing well.
The team has kept on pace for 
its first trip to the Division III 
national tournament, as it is vir
tually tied for second place with 
Washington & Jefferson, one of 
the schools the Tartans will face 
today at the Mid-Atlantic Regional 
Championship in Hershey, Pa.
Every tournament we play 
is to get us in a better position 
for nationals, Timmons said. 
Every shot we hit, were think

Student groups raise awareness for athletics
by Andrea Garvue
Staffwriter
I didnt even know until af
ter my freshman year that we 
had a varsity golf team, re
called sophomore Becky Metier. 
This is probably true of a lot of 
Carnegie Mellon students, and 
explains why groups such as 
the Student Athletic Advisory 
Council (SAAC), Carnegie Clan, 
and Student Athlete Volunteer 
Experience (SAVE) are working 
together to bring athletics above 
ground both on campus and in
the Pittsburgh community.
The end goal of all three orga
nizations is to increase awareness, 
excitement, and respect for 
athletics, with SAAC working 
within Carnegie Mellons varsity 
community, the Carnegie Clan 
working within the campus com
munity, and SAVE reaching out 
to the greater Pittsburgh commu
nity. Yes, Carnegie Mellon has a 
golf team  and 16 other varsity 
athletic programs, dozens of club 
teams, and an intramural pro
gram. Most importantly, Carnegie 
Mellon has students who truly 
care about athletics.
All University Athletic 
Association teams have a SAAC 
committee, although Carnegie 
Mellons remained inactive until 
this past year when new athletic 
director Susan Basset brought it 
to life. SAAC is an organization 
composed of two representatives 
from each varsity team who meet 
every other week to discuss issues 
surrounding Carnegie Mellons 
varsity programs.
Currently, SAAC is working to 
improve some of its locker rooms, 
change outdated year-end awards, 
and raise support between varsity 
programs. SAAC was also respon
sible for the concession stands 
that were available at basketball 
games and track meets this year. 
All the money that is raised by 
SAAC goes straight back to the 
athletes.
I think the big thing we are 
trying to do is raise awareness 
for the athletes, said SAAC co
chair and volleyball player Catie 
Fisher. I just really want people 
to come to games. I hate the fact 
that we go to every other school 
and their stands are filled, and 
then you come to ours and for 
volleyball games only a quarter of 
the stands are filled. Its really sad
and depressing that no one wants 
to cojne out or no one even knows 
about us.
This year SAAC plans to have 
an end-of-the-year barbecue for 
all athletes and next year plans to 
hold a ball. It was our first year, 
but I think that we have accom
plished a lot, Fisher said.
The Carnegie Clan has a similar 
mission as the SAAC, but its focus 
is geared more towards raising 
the general student populations 
awareness of athletics.
It was interesting this year 
because we were trying to get 
people to events at the same time
as SAAC was, said Metier, an ac
tive member of both committees. 
We were actually kind of step
ping on each others toes, and it 
was frustrating because we didnt 
really know what organization 
was doing what and we didnt 
want people to get the two or
ganizations confused. One is to 
better varsity athletes and one to 
get campus involved.
When we first started 
[Carnegie Clan] we were getting 
comments like We have ath
letics on this campus? Metier

fall two short 
of a victory

Another tournament meant 
another impressive performance 
by Carnegie Mellons varsity golf 
team. Last Thursday, the Tartans 
hosted the annual Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational at the Longue 
Vue Country Club and finished 
second, firing a 299 in the oneday tournament  two strokes 
behind Washington & Jefferson 
University. The Tartans B-team 
finished third, posting a 320.
Between the two squads, the 
Tartans carded six of the top eight 
scores for the tournament amid 
ideal weather.
I thought our kids played very 
well. It was a perfect day to play. 
It was 63, 64 degrees, not a cloud 
in the sky, no wind. The greens 
were receptive, said coach Rich 
Erdelyi. The course was in per
fect shape, and I think the scores 
reflected that. Eight out of our 
nine kids shot in the 70s. It was 
a fine day, and we were very con
sistent.
Despite the Tartans solid play, 
Washington & Jefferson won the 
tournament with a 297, led by 
first-year Marc Fillari, who shot a 
remarkable two-under 68.

The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
womens track and field teams 
persevered in the face of inclem
ent weather conditions to take 
home second and third places 
at the Washington & Jefferson 
Invitational on Saturday.
Our race was freezing and 
windy, remarked junior runner 
Geoff Misek.
It was snowing, added senior 
Jocelyn Sikora.
The men finished second over
all with 131 points, falling behind 
Allegheny Colleges 236.5 points. 
The women finished third over
all with a total of 117 points, 
again trailing Allegheny College 
(197.5 points) and Washington 
& Jefferson University (143 
points).
The Tartan men collected over 
20 top-five finishes during the 
meet, with senior Jeff Polack 
winning the 400-meter hurdles 
with a time of 58.04, junior Nick 
Bannister winning the 110-meter 
high hurdles with a time of 15.58 
and junior Davey Quinn winning 
the 800-meter race with a meet 
record time of 1:56.63.
Coming in second for Carnegie 
Mellon were junior Russel 
Verbofsky in the 400-meter race 
with a time of 51.13, first-year 
Colin Marks in the triple jump 
with a jump of 13.05 meters, and 
first-year Ryan Anderson with 
a 10:00.41 finish in the 3000-

Junior Keith Torluemke placed 
third in the 800-meter race with

with a time of 3:29.37.
The Tartans dominated the 
1500-meter run as Misek finished 
third with a time of 4:06.71, firstyear Brian Harvey came in fourth 
with a time of 4:07.48, and soph
omore Drew Miller finished fifth 
with a time of 4:07:54.
A kid from Frostburg [State 
University in Maryland] took 
the race out in 30 [seconds] 
for the first 200 [meters], 
which is blazing,' said Misek. 
In the meantime me, Harvey,
Dana Irrer, Miller, and another 
Allegheny kid were all in it to

In the long jump, Marks took 
fourth with a jump of 6.06

For the women, Sikora won 
the 800-meter race with a time 
of 2:23.82. I stuck with the pack 
the first lap and went with the 
girl in front on the second, said 
Sikora. I was going to take her 
with 200 [meters] to go, but then 
decided to wait until the home 
stretch. Sophomore Ashley 
Bakelmun crossed the line close 
behind Sikora with a time of 
2:26.93, finishing third.
In her first race of the season, 
senior Drea Garvue came off the 
injured list to win the 5000-me

the shot put (15.14 meters) and
in the 35 pound weight (17.08 
meters) and the outdoor track 
and field school record in the 
hammer throw (51.06 meters).
The Tartan recently had the 
chance to speak with Tom about 
his success on the track and 
field team.
Tartan: Why do you compete 
in field events, and when did 
you start?
Matta: I started throwing 
back in high school, and this 
is my eighth year of throw
ing. I love the competition, the 
power-training, and the feeling 
of getting better inch by inch.
T: What is the hardest part 
about being a student athlete at 
Carnegie Mellon?
M: Most people assume its 
balancing the workload. But 
thats not true. Carnegie Mellon 
student athletes have developed 
excellent time management 
skills over the years. The hard
est part about being a student 
athlete at Carnegie Mellon is 
working hard for a whole year 
for individual or team success 
and then having the student 
body either not hear about it 
or not care. But thats slowly 
changing due to student orga
nizations like the Carnegie Clan 
and the SAAC [Student Athletic 
Advisory Council]  and its 
an exciting time to be a part of 
Carnegie Mellon athletics.
T: What is the best part of be
ing a student athlete?
M: The best part is walk
ing with the team through the 
airport to our gate, a mass of 
burgundy warm-ups. Everyone 
in the terminal watches us. Its 
pretty cool.
Other good parts are beating 
kids from Washington University 
and Case Western University. I 
hate those schools. Oh yeah, 
Chicago University sucks too 
 beating kids from Chicago is 
pretty fun.
T: Where is your favorite place 
to compete and why?
M: Theres, no place like 
home. Gesling is a beautiful 
stadium and a great place to 
throw. Theres nothing like a 
Saturday morning track meet, 
seeing the sun slowly rise over 
the University Center, and get
ting to throw stuff.
Most people dont know 
about that big cage on the in
tramural field. Thats where we 
throw the hammer and discus. 
During my freshman year, one 
of the older guys bet our coach 
that he couldnt throw a fullsize car tire over the top of the 
cage. He grabbed it, one-turned, 
grunted, and threw it over the 
top. It must have been over 25 
feet. Each dent in that cage is a 
different story.
T: What is your most mean
ingful accomplishment to date?
M: Last year I was the Indoor
Conference Field Athlete of the 
Year, because I won both the 
shot put and the weight at the 
same meet. I had two huge per
sonal bests and was on top of 
the podium twice at the New 
Balance Armory in New York 
City. Ill never forget it, or that 
reuben I had at the deli down 
the street. It was incredible.
T: To what do you attribute 
your success in track and field?
M: Hard work in the
off-season, focused in-season 
practice, and desire most of all. 
If you dont want it, youll never 
get it.
T: What do you do in your 
spare time?
M: I like to help out with the 
Carnegie Clan. The Carnegie 
Clan is a student organization 
that puts on events before and 
during home athletic competi
tions.
The Carnegie Clan runs the 
Homecoming Chili Cook-Off 
every year and other tailgating 
events and giveaways. Were 
bringing back the Guns of 
Carnegie arm-wrestling com
petition this year on April 29. 
So start cleaning your guns, its 
going to be a big show!
T: What is your favorite sport 
other than track and field?
M: Football, because theres 
nothing better than black and 
gold in the fall, baby!

Philharmonie at Heinz
Sir Andrew Davis leads an impressive showDid you know?
Last Wednesday night, Heinz Hall, the home of the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, was home to the 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic. For this concert, the 
Philharmonic was conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, 
the artistic director of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra (PSO). The program included Dvorak's 
beloved Symphony No. 9 in E minor, subtitled 
From the New World, and Shostakovichs cheeky 
Symphony No. 9 in E-flat major.
The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic was prepared 
by Walter Morales for a week before they played 
at Heinz Hall. Davis worked with the orchestra on 
the Monday and Tuesday before the concert. This 
is a common practice among orchestras, even 
professional orchestras like the PSO. An assistant 
conductor often prepares the PSO, familiarizing it 
with new works or reacquainting it with classics, 
so the guest conductor can work on details rather 
than the basics. -
Most professional orchestras run a very compact 
rehearsal schedule. The PSO typically performs 
concerts on Friday and Saturday evenings, and 
Thursday nights or Sunday afternoons. The 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic gives numerous 
concerts throughout the year. They typically 
rehearse for about two weeks before giving a 
concert.
Davis has previously recorded all of Dvorak's 
symphonies. I heard the seventh and eighth 
symphonies and thought the performances 
were quite dry. The sound was very full and 
Germanic, not the type of sound that suits Dvorak's 
economical but colorful symphonies. A lot of the 
magic of Dvoraks music is its spontaneity and the 
sudden returns of themes in new, colorful ways
 something that Davis interpretations lacked.
So, Davis and the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic 
had the weight of my expectations against them 
on Wednesday night. Overall, the performance 
came off very well. Davis' interpretation of the first 
movement was rather static. The first movement 
of the New World" symphony is a journey, but I 
was left feeling lost, like I had not gone anywhere.
I was dismayed as the wonderful waypoints of the 
first movement passed by without any significance. 
This was mostly due to Davis fiddling with the 
tempos too much. The orchstra distinguished 
itself throughout, however. The confidence of the 
brass section was projected in nearly every blast of 
sound, and the woodwinds were full of personality.
The second and third movements were very good 
as well. I was not happy with the brass chords that 
open the second movement. The brass section slid 
through the chord changes rather than moving to 
them, denying shape to the harmony. The English 
horn solo was enjoyable, while the theme had a 
sense of movement and was not overly articulated 
and mannered  a pitfall often seen with dotted 
rhythms. The third movement was distinguished
by very rhythmic percussion that gave a lot of 
energy to the sound. And the wind solos with 
string accompaniment sounded very authentic; the 
accompaniment was strongly accented.April 10, 1956
The fourth movement was very exciting. The 
brass was very powerful and full of conviction 
in this movement. Davis conducting was good 
as well. Some strategically placed accelerandos 
created even more energy. The violins were decent 
throughout the piece, although they were prone to 
some rushing.
The second half of the program consisted 
of Shostakovichs ninth symphony. When 
Shostakovich was asked to write the piece, the 
Soviet authorities wanted a grandiose celebration April 14,1981
of the Red Armys victory in World War II. They 
wanted his symphony to be on the same massive 
scale as Beethovens ninth symphony, the famous 
home of Ode to Joy. Shostakovichs reply was a 
short, chamber-like symphony with extended solos.
Shostakovich's cheekiness is aptly demonstrated 
by the fact that his symphony is in E-flat major, a 
half-step from the key of Beethoven's ninth, in D 
major.
Davis interpretation of the symphony was 
excellent. The performance kept the symphonys 
spirit of wit and cheekiness. Shostakovich 
often wrote parts in his orchestral works that 
showcased a particular group of instruments, 
such as the winds. Carnegie Mellon's winds often 
play in small ensembles with each other, and 
this familiarity showed. The second and fourth 
movements accumulated great poignancy. Davis 
did well to make use of the silence and minimal 
accompaniment to create an atmosphere of 
pensiveness and reflection. The wind solos in April 9, 2001
these two movements displayed an astonishing 
emotional maturity. Also, the trumpet solo in the 
third movement, although it lost a bit of velocity, 
was full of bravura. The fifth movement was very 
good as well. Davis decided on a breakneck pace at 
the end of the movement. The tempo was effective, 
but its execution less so. The violins tended to 
speed up, and then the winds slowed things down
with a tone too large for the speed of their parts. ^
The final bars were perfectly played, though, and 
the symphony ended with a bang.
All in all, the concert was a fantastic success and 11 f 2005
the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic's playing was
very impressive. The orchestra and conductor got
a massive round of applause that culminated in
a standing ovation. Kathryn Petrarulo, a first-year
music major and horn player in the Philharmonic,
said, Weve had really good concerts, but this was
one of the best. She felt that the orchestra worked
well with Davis, who was very funny and outgoing
with the orchestra.

The Newman Club, which, if you didnt know, 
was and is the Catholic club on campus, held 
an Easter Orphans Party. The party included fun 
in the Tech swimming pool. Great, thats exactly 
what orphans need  to be sitting on a tile floor, 
freezing cold, and soaking wet in the middle of 
a typically tumultuous Pittsburgh April..I bet they 
really appreciated that.
The White [sic] powder discovered in Warner Hall 
which was thought to be asbestos was actually 
found to be dust," reported The Tartan. Asbestos 
wasnt necessarily the first choice for what the 
substance might be; on the docket were also 
powdered milk, powdered sugar, and Powder 
 the hit movie from 1995.
The Tartan gave a little taste of the lighter side of 
iife by suggesting road trips for students who are 
stressed out. The headline read Explorers hit the 
road. Funny, the only thing most Explorers have 
been hitting lately is pocketbooks, thanks to their 
massive rubber tires of death and poverty.
Big news on campus was the dumping of multiple 
bags of recyclable paper outside of the University 
of Pittsburgh's Frick Fine Arts Building. When 
officers inspected the bags to view the contents, 
they were struck by the beauty of all those 
advertisements for Temptation at Club Matrix. 
Many officers elected to attend the party, and the 
group throwing the bash was never cited.
Rest in peace, i2hub. This issue of The Tartan 
commented on students who were facing the fire 
from the RIAA. Back in the day (2005), i2hub let 
students gobble up downloads from their friends 
and neighbors. It was a good time. And then the 
RIAA killed it. Cause they said it was illegal. Sigh. 
Illegal shmillegal. i2hub was my precious.

Ray-Min handbags are now

Factory. To the left are some

Custom-made handbags break into Pittsburgh
Ray-Min Shoulderware uses vintage fabrics to create purses
It started in a one-bedroom apartment in Boston; now it is 
on the racks in three cities and numerous homes beyond.
It is Ray-Min Shoulderware  not simply handbags, but 
handcrafted ones made with vintage fabric, and embroidered 
with care.
Minette Vaccariello and her boyfriend Raymond Morin have 
transformed their craft in the past few years from churning 
out some basic bags for an art gallery (the Olive, in Lawrence, 
Kan.  the location of their first sale) to having a fan base of 
customers and a line of custom-made bags. Their website, 
ray-minshoulderware.com, lacks a lot of verbiage, merely 
saying that Ray-Min Shoulderware was created in 2003 
to "create unique handbags that reflected our [Ray and 
Minette's] personal styles and interests."
Yet, chatting with Vaccariello, you get a fuller picture of how 
Ray-Min Shoulderware came to be. After getting a request for 
some artwork from a friend in Kansas, Vaccariello and Morin 
left the project to the last minute and had to produce bags 
rather than their original ideas. "That's what we did (made 
bags] and thats how it started," she said. "Raymond didn't 
know how to sew. I gave him a quick lesson and left him alone 
with a sewing machine all day." Of her early bag-making 
process, Vaccariello said, I sew two pieces of fabric together, 
turn it inside out, put a strap on it  it's a bag.
After a great reception at the Olive Gallery, the venue that 
got their first works and still carries shoulderware on stock, 
Vaccariello and Morin began making bags for friends. They 
eventually moved from Boston, where Vaccariello was 
studying, to Pittsburgh. What Vaccariello studied then and 
studies now may be a bit of a shock  in Boston she was a 
mechanical engineering student. Now she is a graduate in 
product development at Carnegie Mellon.
Engineering and bag-building may seem unrelated, but 
Vaccariello disagreed. "When I approach the designs, creating 
a bag is almost like building. I see it in a three-dimensional 
way. [I think of] what kind of structure I need to show." She 
laughed and added, "I definitely dont do stress analysis tests 
on bags.
Morin and Vaccariello stumbled into starting their own 
business in the same way they began bag-making. "For a 
while it was just this thing that we did in our apartment," 
said Vaccariello. "When we sold a lot of our bags for the first 
time, people would write us checks to our business name, but 
we couldnt deposit them until we were a business." One of 
her close friends started a design firm, and that became an 
inspiration to Vaccariello as she drove forth on her business 
venture.
Designing and crafting bags is not all that fills Vaccariello's 
day. She must also perform her role as a student at Carnegie 
Mellon. Still, most of the handiwork has come from her as of 
late since Morin was busy starting his own record label.
Each bag is made by hand, and takes a long while to make. 
But if you are dying to find a piece of Ray-Min Shoulderware, 
you don't have to look far, thanks to the Mattress Factory. A 
woman working at the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art 
museum in the North Side, contacted Vaccariello through a 
MySpace site, and once again serendipity struck. Soon, RayMin bags graced the walls of the Mattress Factory gift shop.
For those that don't live in Boston, Lawrence, or Pittsburgh, 
there is the option to custom order a Ray-Min bag. Custom 
ordering is more popular than buying retail. Most requests are 
not very demanding  just requests for color changes and 
size differences, Vaccariello said. However, a few have pushed
the limits of customization. Vaccariello calls the biggest bag 
she ever made "a monstrosity." She described the customer's 
tall order: She wanted like a laptop bag but a tote bag.... It 
had a laptop pocket and a hidden zipper pocket; she wanted a 
matching coin purse with all these pockets. It was huge.
Big or small, the most striking thing about a piece of Ray-Min 
Shoulderware is the uniqueness of the design. The bags look 
different than anything else on the shelves, but they are not 
particularly intricate at a glance. The fabrics are sturdy and 
the designs classic, with thin lines of embroidery in patterns 
such as starbursts or zig-zags. Part of the bags' individuality 
comes from their little secrets, the pockets that Vaccariello 
loves to add to bags. She said they have added chapstick 
pockets, lipstick pockets, bus pass pockets, and more to their 
bags.
Though Vaccariello has already scored a job for when she 
graduates from her masters program this spring, she hopes to 
keep making bags. The business, she said, already pays for 
itself, but the money is hardly the motivator. Though each bag 
is handmade, they are reasonably priced, with the retail bags 
generally going for less than $100. Custom bag prices depend 
on the extensiveness of the request.
I just enjoy doing it, said Vaccariello, "It makes me so happy 
knowing people are wearing my product.

Burning the midnight oil via the Internet
Procrastination prevails with the help of Facebook, IM, and e-mail
We have reached the period of mixed blessings. The end of 
the year is in sight, and summer will be here soon. Sunlight 
has graced our campus once again and has banished the 
depressing winter for good. Newly admitted students are 
starting to flood the campus, and Pittsburgh finally feels 
warm.
Well, maybe things have not become that cheery. The return 
of good weather also means that classes will start wrapping 
up, so professors will expect to see projects, papers, and 
exams on their desks soon. The workloads of students will 
reach critical mass and we'll begin to pull our hair out. In the 
next few weeks, we will receive fewer and fewer chances to 
go outside and enjoy the good weather. All of us will have to 
face the late-night crunch at one point or another, and time 
will not be on our side. Each of us will have to either race the 
clock or sacrifice sleep before the semester ends. So what do 
we do?
Tamara Tunie, an actress from As the World Turns and a 
Carnegie Mellon alum, believes that there are more hours in 
the day than we think there are and that our time can hold 
more than we think. More often than not, however, we feel 
like the days are far too short. Experts have developed tried 
and true methods for time management, like to-do lists, 
schedule books, and importance grids, and we have plenty 
of help available aid us in the struggle to quit our excessive 
time-wasting.
Debra Brindis, coordinator of academic counseling and 
supplemental instruction in the Academic Development 
Office, agrees that as the year comes to an end, students 
will begin to feel much more anxiety. She believes that time 
management involves controlled partition.
"Most times, if you can break [work] down into small chunks, 
that takes anxiety out of it, said Brindis. She said that time 
management problems affect all students, from first-years to 
graduates. Brindis noted another key approach to avoiding 
procrastination that involves determination and trust in slow 
improvement. Habits are hard things to break, really, and as
finals creep up, our bad habits can slowly get the better of us. 
"Procrastination and time management go hand in hand," 
Brindis said. "The important thing is that you cant change 
[bad habits] overnight."
So what are these bad habits? As college students, we 
depend on the computers on our desks and in the clusters to 
accomplish much of our work. But the sirens of Flash games 
and instant messaging often lure us to villainous distraction. 
Our papers, projects, research, and communication need to 
revolve around computers and the Internet, and this makes 
our late nights very difficult. It is so easy to get distracted.
You can be in the middle of writing a paper, and all it takes 
to focus on something else is an urge to check your e-mail. 
Sure, you'll resolve to check your e-mail for one second, then... 
oh look! Theres a new friend confirmation waiting for you 
on Facebook! So then you begin checking this new persons 
profile out, and soon you could be talking to them on AOL 
Instant Messenger. More conversations begin to take your 
attention, and after a while your friend calls about one thing 
or another. Before you know it, your break has turned into a 
vacation. Theres a reason there is a Facebook group called 
"Facebook Makes Me Fail School.
As Brindis said via e-mail, counselors agree that cell phones 
and Internet services like Facebook are among the worst time 
wasters for college students. Other guilty services are sites 
like www.killsometiine.coni, which, as the title suggests, 
caters directly to our procrastinating desires. Then theres 
www.ebaumswoild.com,www.newgrounds.com, and even a 
www.procrastinate.net, which really doesn't have anything on 
it because the creator says hes procrastinating.
Granted, there are many forms of productive procrastination. 
That is an oxymoron, but think about activities like working 
out, personal reading, or news-hounding. While many 
students do not see these as distractions, some still see these 
as a way to escape school work. Its not a hard argument to 
say that productive procrastination is much better than web 
surfing.
With so many available methods that whittle hours away 
for students, marketers have begun to-realize that many 
college students put things off to the last minute until they 
must pull the inevitable all-nighter. Just look at how energy 
drinks like Red Bull are beginning to direct propaganda at 
the procrastinating masses. The ease of putting off work has 
made burning the midnight oil the new norm, as so many 
lights across campus remain lit until 2 or 3 am.
If you like the pressure of finishing work five minutes before 
class time, by all means keep the Web available. However, the 
best advice for victims of procrastination is this: Lose the Net.

Intricate graffiti decorates 
 or ruins  brick walls 
on Melwood Avenue in 
Oakland.
Save the writings on the walls
Local graffiti is both vandalism and art
Boys have been writing on walls since the beginning of time. 
Well, perhaps that is an exaggeration, but this scribbling 
tendency is quite ancient. Recent research by R. Dale Guthrie, 
a professor emeritus at the University of Alaska and author of 
The Nature of Paleolithic Art, shows that the cave drawings 
from 35,000 years ago were primarily created by boys aged 
nine to 17. The concepts and images in the drawings are 
quite similar to the artwork and graffiti of modern adolescent 
males. In an article from the March 31 issue of Discovery 
News, Guthrie said, "I think the full larder [of] success of the 
excitement and danger of killing a giant bison or auroch in 
the Pleistocene was the equivalent to the testosterone of art 
today.
The most convincing evidence for Guthrie's theory is the 
handprints that are on the cave walls next to the art. When 
these handprints were compared to earlier research on male 
and female hands, it was shown that most of them belonged 
to young men.
One wonders if the boys who drew on the walls 35,000 years 
ago faced the same reaction from their society as the graffiti 
writers of today.
Pittsburghs abandoned buildings, open highways, pocket 
neighborhoods, and freight yards are a graffiti writers dream. 
The Pittsburgh graffiti scene, which developed in the early 
1980s, has produced nationally and internationally respected ' 
writers such as Necske, Onorok, 21Rak, Prism, and Reke.
There are many impressive pieces on many places throughout 
the city, from rooftops and bridges to alleyways and walls 
(especially along th route of the East Busway). Many 
people, though, are more concerned with the illegality and 
implications of graffiti rather than the quality of the art itself.
The city spends an estimated $250,000 a year in order to 
clean graffiti. In an article last April in the Pittsburgh PostGazette, City Councilman Bill Peduto wrote, "Graffiti in 
our neighborhoods has become pathological. Theres no 
difference when you decide to tag somebodys home or 
private business and cause $400 in damage than if you were 
to reach into their cash register and steal $400. According 
to 2005 statistics, at least a third of those who have been 
arrested for vandalism in Pittsburgh since 2000 have been 
juveniles, over 200 of which were under age 10.
The Pittsburgh Police spent $30,000 on a computer database 
that allows them to search for graffiti by business vandalized, 
address, tag name, neighborhood, or police zone. Every time 
graffiti is removed, a report, along with a picture, will be 
added to the database.
Graffiti is viewed as vandalism, and some people take it as 
a public attack. As Police Commander Kathy Degler said in 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last April, "Its a quality of life 
issue that causes people to feel their neighborhoods are going 
downhill."
What is it about graffiti that causes this reaction? Many 
writers are in crews or gangs, and, of course, the thought 
of gang mentality scares many citizens. People think, "If 
someone is crazy enough to climb up on that bridge to write 
their tag, what else would he do?
Although this view cannot be completely discredited, it 
may be an overreaction. (Stores generally dont want to be 
covered in paint, unless its for advertisement purposes.) As 
Ayanah Moor, professor of contemporary and hip-hop art in 
the College of Fine Arts, pointed out in an article from the 
Pittsburgh City Paper last May, many corporations plaster 
subway cars and buses with their ads, a technique which 
is clearly stolen from graffiti artists. "Rather than having 
a conversation about who made that decision [allowing 
corporations to advertise in this way], we talk about graffiti 
being a pathological problem," wrote Moor.
Not all authorities are on a mission to erase graffiti. In a May
2005 article from the Pittsburgh City Paper, Khari Mosley, 
Pedutos campaign director, wrote of the city councilman's 
anti-graffiti stand: "We cant advocate for the illegal posting 
of tags on peoples walls, but we do need to find safe, legal 
ways for people to put up their work because it can be 
inspirational.
Although this might help some, it would not solve the 
problem. While graffiti writers try to create better pieces each 
time, they also try to put these pieces in places that will make 
people think, Wow, how did he manage to do that there?" 
Places that are designated for graffiti would take away the 
thrill induced by the risks they take to write it.
So how psychopathic is it, really?
Some say that the illegality of graffiti forces writers to act like 
historians: They try to save the legacy of their beloved culture 
by passing down stories and sharing images of what has 
happened.
Writers are under great pressure. It becomes an addiction; 
they get a surge of excitement when they see their piece or 
tag, and they know that if they stop doing it they wont get

As 21Rak, a writer famous for his improvisational style on 
freight cars, said in last Novembers issue of the City Paper, "I 
dont know how graffiti looks to someone that doesn't know 
graffiti, like when they're driving [and see it].... Im sure they 
fucking hate it. As a graffiti writer, you're not doing it for the 
people that dont understand it. You're doing it for the people 
that do."

From blogs to books
Net venting turns to profit for some writers
How do you turn your bitterness about life into a productive 
and creative escape? You create a blog that gets noticed, and 
then get a book published.
In the last few years, more and more people have jumped on 
the blog bandwagon in an effort to bare all their secrets and 
desires or to release anger. Blogs can be anonymous, so there 
is no fear of the harsh backlash youd get from screaming 
at your boss. Many of these blogs are created out of hatred, 
fear, or anger, but more and more people are finding that their 
opinions online may transfer into real money  and a real 
publishing deal. And while we hate to admit it, their blogs 
have become part of our everyday life, and we enjoy them. A 
lot.
Jen Lancaster, author of the newest blog-to-book sensation, 
Bitter Is the New Black: Confessions of a Condescending, 
Egomaniacal, Self-Centered Smart-Ass, or Why You Should 
Never Carry a Prada Bag to the Unemployment Office, is just 
one of many bloggers turned authors in the last few years.
In the book, Lancaster goes from having a well-paying job 
at a Fortune 500 company to being laid off and falling just 
short of being evicted from her apartment in the ghetto. In 
between, though, she lays the foundation for a funny, moving, 
and inspirational story that is deeper than it first appears 
on the surface. She first gives us the impression that her 
superficiality has no hope for change. In short, she is a spoiled 
rich brat about to face the worst of the world. But the last few 
chapters show us a changed, reformed brat who learns to 
appreciate her family and not her collection of Prada Bags.
Before being laid off, Lancasters only goal was to buy that 
$7000 couch she admired. But after being laid off from her
overpaying job, she finds herself in a fierce battle with the rest 
of the nation looking for a job. Faced with having to leave her 
comforts behind, she decides to file for unemployment. And 
as the title may remind us, who walks into the unemployment 
office with a Prada bag? Apparently Lancaster does, and  
with almost none of the style and grace with which Prada is 
associated  she runs into doors, walks into the wrong office, 
and is almost recruited for the Army. Even the unemployment 
staff doesnt like her from the beginning, including the 
woman who speaks in Spanish, and the computer technician 
who yells at her for being too good to be a janitor because she 
has a college degree. And though she frantically submits her 
resume to all the companies she can think of, Lancaster is not 
hired. Ironically, with her credentials and experience, no one 
wants to hire her, including the janitorial company.
With no luck at finding a job, she is left with no choice but 
to leave the comforts of her expensive Chicago penthouse 
apartment and move into a shady neighborhood where no 
one speaks English. While waiting for various companies 
to contact her in response to her resume, she created 
jennsylvania.com, a website dedicated to bashing every 
company that either didnt respond to her resume or wouldnt 
hire her. After a while, her public ranting and not-so-ladylike 
way with words drew a small fan base of people in similar 
situations. Some people even sent her packages of nail polish 
and food as a thank-you for her bitter but realistic advice.
Without knowing it, though, Lancaster creates a problem 
for herself that happens way too often with bloggers. She 
is denied a job because she publicly bashes clients of the 
company on her website. Instead of taking it to heart, she 
laughs the matter off and decides that it was probably for the
best. Who wouldnt laugh at her creative outlet of frustration 
and anger?
Lancaster is not the only blogger whose story has been picked 
up by independent publishing houses, or by imprints of 
bigger publishers. There's a market for new memoir writing, 
and it began in the form of a blog. Take Frank Warren, author 
of PostSecret, for instance. He first created a blogsite online to 
showcase ordinary people's extraordinary secrets. PostSecret, 
a collection of homemade postcards with the secrets of the 
authors scrawled on them, has gained quite a following since 
its release in December of 2005. The market for juicier and 
more anonymous writing has become a big one lately. From 
Madonnas website encouraging people to call in and leave 
their darkest secrets, to music videos about being someone's 
dirty little secret," it seems that secrets are not so secret 
after all. People are now comfortably dishing out their secrets 
and opinions online or writing letters or postcards to people 
thousands of miles away, revealing themselves in more ways 
than one.
Blogs are quickly becoming the wave of the future. The 
number of people who are getting published because of their 
blogs' increasing notoriety goes to show that we are watched, 
even when we don't think we are. Our personal lives online 
are not so personal anymore. And while many new authors 
are finding their beginnings in posts on various blog sites, 
some bloggers are worried that their most inner thoughts and 
feelings can be publicly viewed by everyone, including their 
prospective employers.

The Royal 
Tenenbaums

I got this on DVD for my Secret 
Santa this Christmas past. He 
opened it, looked at it, said, I dont 
like this movie, and set it down. I 
was hurt, sure, but I also realized 
that he had bad taste in movies 
and I didnt want to be his friend 
anyway. The Royal Tenenbaums. is 
odd, and at times hard to digest, 
just like all of Wes Andersons films. 
Its not really a comedy. It just 
kind of... is. And thats the beauty 
of it. A star-studded cast, delicious 
subtlety, and a race to see which 
character can screw up his or her 
life the fastest.
Sympathy for Mr. 
Vengance
Thursday, ApriM 3

From the director of Oldboy, this 
is another South Korean flick 
with plenty of gore, sex, and 
violence. But unlike our Hollywood 
movies, there is actually good 
cinematography, acting, and a 
plot. Dont get too caught up In the 
details of whose sister is dying, who 
is mad at whom, who just killed 
the good guy... this movie will take 
you on a bloody ride of beautiful 
revenge. Plus, it says Tartan on 
the cover, and AB is still showing it, 
so you know it has to be good.
Memoirs of a Geisha
Friday, April 14

Omigosh, guess what school the 
director of this movie went to! He 
went to Carnegie Mellon! He was 
in the musical theater program.
He graduated in 82, slept for 20 
years, then made some movies.
If you have any respect for your 
school at all, you will go see this 
film. No doubt It will be making 
appearances in all future Carnegie 
Mellon propaganda, so you should 
become familiar with it now. What? 
You saw it in theaters and didnt like 
it? Thought the visuals were good 
but that it was a boring movie? 
Were appalled that a Chinese 
actress would play a Japanese 
role? Do you even know where the 
director went to school?!
Fun with Dick and 
Jane
Saturday, April 15

Warning: Saturday is the day not 
sponsored by AB Films. This is 
not a porno. However, you may 
still go to hell for watching it sober, 
because its just not that good of a 
movie. If you enjoyed Ace Ventura, 
still act the age you did back then, 
and want to see something a lot 
less memorable, you could see this 
movie. Its a comedy about Dick 
and Jane, a married couple turned 
partners in crime. They arent as 
sexy or as badass as the Smiths, 
but boy can Jim Carrey make a lot 
of funny faces.
The Prophecy
Sunday, April 16 
81012
This movie stars Christopher 
Walken as an evil angel come to 
Earth to collect a soul to end a 
war in Heaven. No, its not the 
Fatboy Slim music video... it is 
The Prophecy. It also stars Viggo 
Mortensen as Lucifer. I dare 
you to give me a reason why 
you wouldnt go see this movie. 
Screw homework due Monday. 
Christopher Walken started a war in 
Heaven, and hell come for you next 
if you arent there Sunday night.

that is severely limited by its location. For one thing: 
Jefferson Presents... only hosts screenings on a monthly 
basis. "You have to consider what else is happening," said 
Nelson. If theres a Steelers game, nobody goes to see the 
movies." In Pittsburgh, there simply is not enough public 
interest to warrant more frequent showings. "I wish there 
was," added Nelson.
Additionally, Jefferson Presents... suffers a stumbling block 
common to promoters of underground art: a low budget. 
Theres hardly any marketing for the monthly Saturday 
shows. As Nelson put it, "We rely on word of mouth."
With underground operations, theres a fine line between 
quaint and unprofessional: A website hosted by Geocities 
and contact e-mails at yahoo.com dont exactly connote 
the prestige that one would expect to find surrounding an 
independent film venue in, say, New York.
A more professional source of independent film in the area 
is Pittsburgh Filmmakers, a group committed to providing 
opportunities for film artists and audiences. Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers has three locations: a base and screening room 
on Melwood Avenue in North Oakland, the Regent Square 
Theater on South Braddock Avenue in Edgewood, and 
downtown Pittsburghs Harris Theater on Liberty Avenue. 
The Melwood Screening Room is one of the countrys few 
enduring large, single-screen theaters.
Ross Nugent, the theater manager of Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers, explained that one of the goals of his 
organization is to expose the people of Pittsburgh to 
independent film. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it 
doesnt, he said. According to Nugent, the biggest 
obstacle for independent film is not that people don't like it, 
it's that people dont know if they like it.
At this point, you might be wondering: What exactly is 
independent film? Are we talking about this year's Best 
Picture nominees at the Oscars, or some unintelligible 
French art film shot entirely in black and white? It can get 
confusing: Both of these extremes are technically members 
of the independent film genre.
This year it was sort of interesting, said Nugent. It's 
strange to see how things have to be packaged to be 
sold. Nugent theorized that the notion of an indie movie 
holds a lot of appeal. But after a certain point, its hard 
to remember that some independent films werent made
Pittsburgh  It s no New
York. Its no Hollywood. Speaking of 
the Pittsburgh independent film scene, 
curator Gordon Nelson was quick to 
acknowledge the relative inertia of 
our city: Theres not a lot going on, 
he said almost immediately. And its 
true: If you want to find independent 
film venues in Pittsburgh, youre going 
to have to look.
Nelson is one of three curators in charge of Jefferson 
Presents..., a six-year-old organization devoted to showing 
independent short films in monthly presentations. Since 
its birth, Jefferson Presents... has become a staple in 
Pittsburghs realm of independent film. Screenings typically 
have audiences of about 40 people, said Nelson, with loyal 
patrons representing roughly half that number. Admission is 
an affordable five dollars, four with a student discount. The 
shows are almost always located at Garfield Artworks on Penn 
Avenue.
Each film is at most 30 minutes long, and theres really only 
one word that captures the selection: variety. Just look 
at the Jefferson Presents... website, www.geocities.com/ 
jeffersonpresents. On an index of past screenings, titles such 
as Hodgepodge, Mixed Bag of Cinema, Assorted Movies, and 
More Variety dominate the page. Jefferson Presents... does 
occasionally have themed presentations; there was once a 
night for productions by female filmmakers, in addition to An 
Evening of Bug Cinema, which featured films about insects. 
The movies come from online catalogues such as The FilmMakers Cooperative in New York City, where Nelson and his 
associates can rent from a giant library of films whose size 
should keep them satisfied into the far future. I think we 
could probably do this for 20 years," said Nelson. Nearly every 
show begins with at least one project by a filmmaker from 
Pittsburgh. Nelson compared this to a local band playing as 
the opening act for a concert.
But despite the undeniable significance of Jefferson Presents... 
to Pittsburgh's film culture, it's also an example of a film venue

in Hollywood. Crash is probably the epitome of such a 
phenomenon, with a cast that featured more celebrities 
than most of its Hollywood contemporaries. And when 
Crash returned to theaters this winter, it was hard to find 
a mall in the country where it wasn't playing. Nugent 
said that the success of independent movies at this year's 
Academy Awards was, in essence, the culmination of a 
fad. Next year, he predicted, the nominees will probably all 
come from Hollywood.
But the 'Burgh is a long way from the red carpet. Here, 
independent film is far less commercial. Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers aims to promote a diverse selection of material, 
including 16-millimeter short films like those Jefferson 
Presents... shows. For example, last weekend the Melwood 
Screening Room featured a three-day presentation of 
short films called "Crossroads: '70s Avant-Garde Film in' 
Pittsburgh/
Additionally, Pittsburgh Filmmakers offers a host of 
exhibitions of independent feature (full-length) films. 
Coming up at all three Pittsburgh Filmmakers locations is 
the Silk Screen Asian American Festival. Encompassing 
the cultures of several Asian countries, the event is going 
to include more than 30 films. The festival is set to span 
May 12-20, with an opening night gala and workshops 
throughout.
The Harris Theater is currently showing American Gun, 
a 2005 drama that watches a group of families cope with 
a school shooting. After that, April 17-20, the venue will 
feature Antonio Gaud. Named for its subject, an innovative 
architect of Barcelona, the film captures the beauty of 
Gaudis design as director Hiroshi Teshigahara combines 
shots of his work with a variety of evocative music and 
sparse narration.
Antonio Gaud, which was made in 1985, is one of many 
vintage films that Pittsburgh Filmmakers likes to show.
You can see Filmmakers vintage films on Sundays at the 
Regent Square Theater, which has a different series of 
classics every month. This month, Sunday evenings are 
all about female contributions to film. The current series, 
"Calling the Shots: Women Behind the Camera," features 
films of every decade from the 40s to the 80s, including 
Amy Heckerlings Fast Times at Ridgemont High (April 
30). Each night begins with a film by director Maya Deren, 
whose work spans the 40s and '50s.
In May, Regent Square will host "Visions of War E," a 
Sunday series featuring classic war movies such as The 
Deer Hunter (May 7), All Quiet on the Western Front 
(May 21), and Dr. Strangelove (May 28). You could catch 
a lot of these films on television, Nugent pointed out, but 
nevertheless, a lot of people prefer to attend the Regent 
Square presentations. Theres something precious in 
what Nugent called the movie-going experience, and 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers has definitely .tapped into that. 
Showings are often followed by question-and-answer 
sessions where audiences can interact with filmmakers.
When you consider the bulky schedule of current and 
upcoming Pittsburgh Filmmakers events, the Pittsburgh 
independent film scene doesnt seem so stagnant.
The 'Burgh used to be very much a part of the world 
of alternative cinema. "Indeed," reads the Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers website pghfilmmakers.org, in the '70s 
Pittsburgh became the third center' of avant-garde film 
in America." Back then, the now-nonexistent Film Section 
of the Carnegie Museum of Art helped to make Pittsburgh 
a film nexus comparable to New York and Los Angeles. 
Though Pittsburghs status in the film world has evidently 
declined since the 70s, the legacy alone is certainly 
helpful in providing momentum to organizations such as 
Jefferson Presents... and Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
So maybe the independent film scene in Pittsburgh isnt so 
bad. Like most aspects of Pittsburgh, film here is different 
from film anywhere else. In another city, independent 
film might be reserved for an elite art-class of sorts. That 
simply isn't the case here," said Nugent. In Pittsburgh, 
art is anything but pretentious. If you went to Gallery 
Crawl this January, you probably noticed that a significant 
portion of the crowd was composed of legions of Steelers 
fans, who saw no need to take off their jerseys as they 
browsed local art. After last weekends Ben Folds concert, 
the crowd of mostly college-aged students broke into 
"Here we go Steelers, here we go!" and it seemed entirely 
appropriate.
"Theres lot of opportunity for the arts in Pittsburgh," said 
Nugent. Jefferson Presents... might not be a high-brow
venture, but at least it has the opportunity to stand out and 
help local artists do the same.
Would Jefferson Presents... even work in New York? "I feel 
like we'd get swallowed up there," said Nelson. Nelson 
also confirmed the suspicion that it's nearly impossible for 
operations like Jefferson Presents... to make money: Its 
Pittsburgh. No, he said frankly. So film fanatics might not 
be able to quit their day jobs, but this way you can be sure 
they're in it for the right reasons. I think a lot of people 
just do it because they enjoy it," said Nugent. "You change 
culture a little bit."

Big Als Metal Shop
Twenty minutes with A Life Once Lost
Courtesy of sotu.digital-noise.net
A Life Once Lost, pictured above, 
performed recently at Rex Theater 
in the South Side.
As with most things in life, it is the little details that separate 
the good from the glorious. Take the Rex Theater, for example. 
With seats in place, the venue was a good place to watch 
a metal show. Without seats to obstruct crowd movement, 
the Rex has become a glorious venue. Add to that a bevy of 
shows coming up, and you have a recipe for the best kind of 
destruction.
My first show in the new seatless Rex was the Darkest 
Hour/Himsa/A Life Once Lost show last week. It was a very 
good show, with a solid line-up and good crowd containing a 
mixture of the young and the old. What made it stand out was 
A Life Once Lost (ALOL). Taking the stage to the strains of 
classic Black Sabbath, ALOL proceeded to unleash a light and 
sound show not seen since the days of Grace-eia Neurosis.
It isn't often that hardcore kids arent swinging fists and 
roundhouse kicks in a pit, but instead of an opportunity for 
cathartic release, it seems that ALOL wanted the focus on 
them and their message. With lava lamps projected on the 
screen behind them, the emphasis was on a confluence of 
audio and visual stimulation. I have to say that I missed their 
daytime slot on last year's Sounds of The Underground, and I 
hope to see them at this years Ozzfest. However, I think they 
could certainly benefit from a larger stage to play out their 
vision.
What that vision is exactly goes beyond the standard listing of 
their influences. Hunter, ALOLs latest release that is out now 
on Ferret records, is indeed a non-linear path from beginning 
to end, musically speaking. Aggressive, relentless on the 
surface, yet lyrically dense, it unravels more with each listen. 
Unlike other albums Ive discussed in this column, I believe 
that this is an album best heard on speakers, not headphones. 
The sound is large, and deserves walls to reverberate off of.
After their set ended, I was able to chase down vocalist 
Robert Meadows on Carson Street for a 20-minute chat 
on ALOLs sound, words, and long-term plans. With cars 
honking in the background (not to mention tipsy college girls 
staggering by), Meadows let loose on his vision of ALOL and 
their reasons for existence:
On their touring history:
Weve done tours with [various bands], and have tried to 
adapt to a bigger stage. Seeing what works for them and what 
doesn't. In terms of the show, we want to send people home 
with something to remember us by."
On their visuals:
I did see those Neurosis shows, where they had the guy 
do all their visuals, and your attention was just... there. It's 
something weve learned, not to take it to heart if the kids 
arent moving [to the music]. We try to make it a concert with 
a light show."
On their passions growing up:
"We did grow up in the hardcore scene, some of us more
metal with Pantera and such. The Meshuggahs and Black 
Sabbaths. Personally, I'm more into the guys who use vocals 
as an instrument, guys like Randy Blythe from Lamb of God, 
Mike Patton [from Faith No More]. Guys like that keep my 
attention."
On his vocal training:
"I work with Melissa Cross, shes the Scream Lady whos 
worked with Brain Fair and Randy Blythe.... Im actually not 
on her first training DVD, but I'm going to be on her second 
one. Totally notice the difference in the power, the delivery. 
You treat your voice more.... I've been on tour for a year, and 
I can scream longer and last more than ever before. I try to 
make my voice clear and have people hear it.
On their reasons for playing:
Were road dogs  its definitely not about money. It's 
never been about money; I have no money. Ive never made 
money playing. Im here to give someone hope. Im not here 
to tell someone they're wrong for believing.... I'm here to 
tell someone ... that there is someone else who feels pain, 
depression, who feels lonely. And that it's okay to feel these 
emotions, to talk about this. Growing up as a young man,
I didnt have an outlet for these emotions. And that there - 
are creative outlets for them. As a kid, I went to see Orange 
9mm, and I just fell in love with the idea of a band. I went for 
it, said forget school, forget everything, and I've ruined a lot 
of relationship, jobs, lost a lot of friends. In the longterm, I 
see this band continuing, evolving. Talking about a band like 
Neurosis, you see their first album, which was punk, and then 
they evolve into this doom, heavy band and it's awesome that 
they can do that. I get bummed out by people who see this 
life as being about money, consumed by it. There are bands 
like Fugazi who are about the music, keeping the tickets low, 
and being a groundbreaking band  this is what it's about for 
me.
On his message for the kids in Pittsburgh:
I like to tell people that if you want to be where I am, you just 
have to have heart, you have to do it, and not let them tell you 
youre not good enough.
On that note, let me just say that there is another great band 
in Pittsburgh who is doing it, passing out awesome CDs at 
the show last week. Theyre called Brave the Fire, and they 
can be found online at www.bravethefbe.com and at www. 
myspace.com/bravethefire. Look for an interview and CD' 
review sometime soon. Please help support local and live . 
metal.

You will be mauled by the pack of raccoons that lives in the ceilings 
of Baker/Porter. President Cohon will vow to eradicate the malicious 
mammals, but hes underestimated the sophistication of their rodent 
society and the barbarism of their tactics.
This week, you will be implicated in an act of scatological defenestration. 
Which would have been fantastic historical parody, if only you lived in 
Prague..
An overdose of Purell hand sanitizer will leave your skin bleached white, 
but will also give you with supernatural antibiotic properties. Suck on 
that, Penicillin!
This week, you will try Coca-Cola's new carbonated coffee/cola fusion 
drink, Coke Blak, which recently hit the shelves. It is expected to 
vastly outsell its failing competitor, Pepsi Puk.
You will be chosen to be a contestant on NBCs new smash hit Deal, 
or No Deal?, but your episode will never be aired. Howie Mandel will 
commit a Russeil-Crowe-style phone assault after you suggest that he 
shave his soul patch.
You will miss out on Bob Barkers participation in next years Wheel of 
TBA." Hell refuse to spin the wheel because of the significant chance 
that the pornographic selection will feature him and one (or more) of his 
famous beauties in a BRAND NEW CAR!
Tonya Harding will substitute teach your figure skating StuCo. Wear 
kneepads.
Your fraternitys "Crack House" booth will be both the pride and the 
shame of this years Carnival.
You will have no sex this week. (Thats not really a prediction so much 
as a firmly established pattern.)
Your spot-on impersonation of Bob Saget will get you booked at a local 
comedy club. Your spot-on impersonation of Dave Coulier will get you 
vague looks of discomfort from local college girls.
Blood will run like ink in the streets after you pull off the first great 
printer-quota heist in Carnegie Mellon history. Dastardly!
You will sample Starbucks newest blend: Acapulco Gold. Youll wake 
up in Cleveland, penniless, pants-less, and sporting a soul patch.
