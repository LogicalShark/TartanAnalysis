Chief apologizes for Sigma Nu search faux pasCMU opposes 
half percent

Deceit. Dishonesty. Denial. All of 
these are at the root of the city of 
Pittsburghs budget problems, says 
Robert Strauss, professor of econom
ics and public policy.
Its not just that the city is in debt, 
but that the council and the mayor 
have been creative in manipulating 
their finances to make another bud
get by borrowing and re-borrowing, 
said Strauss.
PGH 21  a mayors citizen panel 
dedicated to evaluating the citys 
finances and creating new solutions
 proposed that the city levy two 
new taxes on wages and alcohol to 
weather Pittsburghs $60 million bud
get deficit next year. The new taxes 
would require a levy of 0.5 percent on 
employers gross payrolls and a 10 
percent tax on alcohol.
Strauss attributes the deficit to new 
buildings and venues in Pittsburgh, 
including the stadiums and the con
vention center expansion. The city 
has also engaged in public/private 
ventures, like the client service cen
ters for Mellon and PNC banks. 
Pittsburgh hopes long-term tax rev
enue from greater economic growth 
will outweigh the tax breaks offered 
to corporations that decide to build in 
the city. And while the city has added 
venues for public gathering and use, 
the spending has not helped the city 
of Pittsburgh, said Strauss.
We can see the effects of the citys 
financial problems on the poor level 
of our public services, the broken 
streets, parks, and lack of cleanliness 
in the area, Strauss said. 
Enrollment in the public school sys
tem has gone down from 39,000 stu
dents two years ago to 35,147 now. 
Conflicts between the school board 
and the citys budget may have 
caused a general crisis in the confi
dence that parents had in the school 
system.
The city said these financial prob
lems are historic and a result of a 
series of legislation made by the city 
of Pittsburgh over a number of years.
The citys tax structure is outdated 
and does not reflect the city that we 
are today. PGH 21 has proposed a 
series of recommendations that 
would reform our local tax structure 
and ensure that our tax structure is 
based on a fair and equitable distrib
ution of the burden, said Craig

CMU to back 
Michigan in 
diversity case

Assistant News Editor
The US Supreme Court is poised to 
decide once and for all what is and is 
not passable in terms of race-based 
admissions standards.
The court will hear two affirmative 
action cases brought forth against the 
University of Michigan (UM) during a 
two-week session starting March 24.
The justices decision could have a 
major impact on both public and pri
vate American universities consider
ation of race as a factor in admitting 
students, according to Mary Jo 
Dively, the Universitys general coun
sel.
Barbara Grutter and Jennifer Gratz 
sued UM in 1997. Grutter was reject
ed by the Universitys law school and 
Gratz by their College of Literature, 
Science and the Arts.
They claim that the decision was 
unconstitutional under the Equal 
Protection Clause of the 14th 
Amendment.
The cases have bounced around in 
the lower courts for the last five 
years, with conflicting and puzzling 
rulings.
Its been a very cloudy issue for 
universities. Its possible that the 
court decided to take the case 
because enough is enough. We need 
to provide some clarification, said 
Dively.
Although most universities are 
eager for the issue to be more explic
it, many fear that the courts will over
turn the 1978 ruling (University of 
California vs. Bakke) that upheld the 
idea of affirmative action in general,

Chief of Police Creig Doyle has 
written an apology letter to the 
Sigma Nu fraternity for an unwar
ranted search his department con
ducted on November 21. Brothers 
waited for 15 minutes outside in the 
brisk fall weather for two uniformed 
police officers, one uniformed secu
rity guard, and a plainclothes detec
tive to leave their house.
The police conducted an unsched
uled fire drill, during which time 
they visually inspected the house for 
an antique bell stolen from the Pi 
Kappa Alpha (PiKA) fraternity. But in 
an interview Doyle denied that it was

Student body president Brian 
Namey issued the first veto of his 
term to condemn the Freedom of 
Information Act (FIA) legislation, 
which Senate passed on Thursday, 
November 21, with a vote of 10 to 
six with two abstentions.
Quentin Steenhuis, the H&SS 
junior who spearheaded the legisla
tion and serves as internal develop
ment chair, said his committee 
worked on the bill for over six 
months before presenting it to 
Senate. However, Nameys veto 
questioned the amount of informaa search, referring to it as a fire 
drill. He also said that police could 
have obtained a warrant, but wanted 
the matter to remain internal.
The police activated the fire alarm 
without informing the fraternity 
beforehand when the exercise would 
occur. Doyle confirmed that it was 
the only unscheduled fire drill he 
had conducted. Both Doyle and Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael Murphy 
said it was highly unlikely that the 
police would ever conduct a similar 
operation again.
The fire drill at the Sigma Nu 
house was a follow-up on input that 
Campus Police had obtained since 
the beginning of the investigation.
We had received substantial 
information from a reliable source
tion gathered and the legality of the 
bill. The veto also stated that Namey 
fully supports freedom of informa
tion, but Steenhuis questions the 
veracity of this statement.
It looks bad to say I dont sup
port freedom of information,  said 
Steenhuis. He added that the argu
ments in the veto are either trivial or 
would actually harm the bill.
In his veto, Namey stated that a 
non-trivial number of students do 
not understand the legislation, 
[it] is unnecessarily ambiguous, 
Student Government does not have 
the resources to execute the legisla
tion, and the process by which the 
legislation was passed was uncon
stitutional.
It is a ridiculous statement to 
make that I am in favor of transparthat the stolen bell was located 
inside the Sigma Nu house, wrote 
Doyle in an email to The Tartan.
The fire drill was a tactic used 
during the investigation, intended to 
resolve a criminal matter internally, 
stated Doyle, who added that there 
was an indication that illegal entry 
was made to steal the bell, which 
makes the crime a felony and not 
theft.
In an email to The Tartan, Ian 
Kash, Sigma Nu president, stated 
While they [Campus Police] did not 
actively search, they kept their eyes 
open for a piece of stolen property 
that they believed we had, based on 
a single statement from a third 
party.
The police walk-through was not a
ent government, said Namey.
Namey said that working on the 
bill ought to concern conversation 
rather than information sessions. 
He also said that he could not find a 
group of students or senators who 
understood the bill enough to have 
an intelligent conversation about it.
Namey questions implementing a 
new process when the current 
process is not even being followed. 
He said that a paragraph in the stu
dent body constitution which 
instructs Senate to publish budgets 
in The Tartan had not been followed 
for the last couple of semesters.
Student body vice president Dan 
Gilman, who helped edit the veto, 
concurs with Namey.
There was not proper communi
cation with student organizations, 
said Gilman, a junior philosphy 
major. He added that he would like 
to see meeting with Booth and 
Buggy chairs, as well as Activities 
Board members, because of their 
stake in the bill. For example, Buggy 
budgets are traditionally closely 
guarded to hide materials innova
tions from competitors.
Mark Tomczak, a sophomore SCS 
senator who served on the Internal 
Development committee working 
on the bill and was last week elected 
chair of the communications com
mittee, agreed that the bill probably 
needed to be looked at again, 
although he voted to pass the bill 
originally.
The veto may be an indication 
that we need to reword the bill, 
said Tomczak.
Despite Senate and executive mis
givings, Steenhuis stands behind his 
bill. When asked about rumors of 
his intentions to run for student
search because a warrant had not 
been issued, stated Doyle. Places of 
concealment, like closets and draw
ers, were not opened or closely 
inspected.
Police said they recovered two 
highway signs that will be returned 
to PennDot authorities. A marijuana 
pipe was also recovered and will be 
destroyed. But no bell was found.
James G. Gordon, of the law firm 
James G. Gordon & Associates said, 
If this is a ruse, then obviously they 
broke the law.
They have to have a warrant to 
conduct a search, he said.
According to Kash, the police went 
to each bedroom in the fraternity 
and knocked. If someone answered, 
he was asked to leave because of the
body president next semester, 
Steenhuis declined to comment. But 
he said that the current situation 
elucidates the difference between 
what a president can be and is, 
someone who works for the stu
dents rather than as a proxy for the 
administration.
If a two-thirds majority of Senate 
agrees, Nameys vote can be over
turned. In the case that it is not, it 
remains unclear whether or not 
Senate will pursue the legislation 
next semester. The Senate chairelect, Vito Fiore, thinks the bill has 
some merit.
Senate worked really hard on the 
policy. To see it vetoed like that was 
kind of disappointing, but I think he 
does have some legitimate con
cerns, said Fiore, a senior H&SS 
senator. But I still think, in sum 
total, the benefits [of the policy] 
outweigh the costs.
We pay a lot to go here. I think

Housing to 
end lease on 
James Manor
by Nick Ennis
Staffwriter
Even with a new dormitory in the 
campus housing system next fall, stu
dents will not see a significant 
increase in the total number of beds 
available to them.
The Henderson renovation and the 
completion of the new dorm on 
Morewood Avenue will add 300 beds 
to the housing supply. However, 
Housing Services plans to cancel up 
to one fourth of its leases in Oakland 
apartment buildings in response. Tim 
Michael, director of Housing 
Services, said that Housing might 
stand to gain around 100 spaces in 
the end.
Though we will have 300 new 
beds, we wont have 300 new resi
dents in the fall. said Michael, So 
we should cancel some of the leases.
Discussion between Housing and 
affected residents will occur in 
December and January, after 
Housing determines the exact num
ber and location of the leases to be 
terminated.
One option is to allow the affected 
student residents to continue living in 
the apartments, but require them to 
rent direcdy from the buildings land
lords. Regardless of the final approval 
of this plan, all affected students will 
be allowed to take part in a special 
housing selection process to be held 
at the start of room draw.
Off-campus apartments cater to 
students who want a more individual 
living space, a kitchen, and personal 
bathroom  options not available in 
many campus dormitories. Students 
who chose to rent off-campus apart
ments through Carnegie Mellon 
Housing do so mostly for conve
nience, according to Michael. He 
admits that off-campus housing is 
available at lower prices, but leases 
through the University include utili
ties, cable television, and DSL ser
vice. In short, residents pay more for 
convenience.
Housing will not specify which 
leases will be cancelled, but does pre
fer to lease rooms in blocks rather 
than sporadic rooms in the off-campus apartment buildings. Because 
students live next to other students, 
the buildings can become more social 
places. While the majority of 
Cathedral Mansions is rented by 
Carnegie Mellon, buildings like 
Webster and Fairfax do not have 
block rentals.
James Manor in Shadyside, which 
currently houses 24 students, will not 
remain in the housing system next 
fall.
The lease agreement with Carnegie 
Mellon was only for one year, and all 
student residents were aware of the 
arrangement when they selected 
apartments.
Michael said there is need for more 
living space on campus because the

Bangladesh bomb 
kills 15 in theater
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP)  
Bombs tore through four movie the
aters packed with Muslims celebrat
ing the end of Ramadan on Saturday, 
killing at least 15 people and wound
ing 200, police and witnesses said.
The bombs went off within 30 min
utes of each other starting at about 6 
pm, and were believed to have been 
planted in the projection rooms of the 
theaters, a police official said on con
dition of anonymity.
. i Many of the victims were injured 
by falling bricks or steel. The death 
toll could rise because some of the 
wounded were in critical condition, 
doctors said.
o ' The movie theaters in the town of 
Mymensingh, about 70 miles north of 
the capital Dhaka, were crowded 
with people celebrating Eid-al-Fitr, 
the Islamic festival marking the end 
of Ramadan. About 3,000 people 
were believed to be inside and around 
the theaters when the explosions 
occurred.
-It was a terrible scene. Doctors 
were overwhelmed with so many 
irijured people being brought at the 
hospital, said Muzahed Ahmed, a 
imiversity teacher who took part in 
the rescue work.
- A local television channel reported 
a fifth explosion at a movie theater 
outside Mymensingh, but police 
denied that.
No one claimed responsibility for 
the blasts. Police chief Modabbir 
Hossain Chowdhury said the explo
sions appeared to be the works of an 
organized group, but did not identi
fy any suspects.
, Ten people were killed instantly, 
while five others died on way to a 
hospital, a local resident quoted doc
tors as saying. Jahangir Alam, a jour
nalist, was standing near one of the 
theaters before the explosions 
occurred. There were dead from at 
least three of the theaters.
I heard a big bang and then saw 
many people running for shelter, 
Alam told The Associated Press by 
phone. There were bodies lying in 
blood and many injured crying for 
help.
Hospital officials have appealed for 
blood donations to treat the injured.

Needle exchange is 
passed by courts
; BOSTON (AP)  A person enrolled 
in a needle exchange program in one

Obtained through the program any

Lynn last year, even though she was a 
member of an authorized needle 
exchange program in Cambridge.
J In Massachusetts, except for cer

[ The Legislature amended that law 
in 1993 to allow possession of needles

fities: Boston, Cambridge,
Northampton and Provincetown.
 The program was designed to fight

South Koreans 
protest US embassy
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)  About 
15,000 people carrying candles 
protested across the street from the 
American Embassy on Saturday, in 
the largest show of anti-US sentiment 
in years.
The protesters, upset with what 
they say is preferential treatment to 
American soldiers in Korea, booed 
and chanted President Bush apolo
gize! and Lets drive out the mur
derous American GIs!
About 9,000 police armed with hel
mets, batons and plastic shields 
spread out in districts around the 
embassy. Police buses surrounded the 
embassy compound.
The protest underscores how sensi
tive ties between Washington and 
Seoul have become. The allies bond, 
forged during the Korean War, is 
being tested by widespread anger 
that followed acquittals of two 
American soldiers whose armored 
vehicle struck and killed two 13-yearold South Korean girls in June.
The two soldiers left the country 
after they were acquitted last month.
The trial may be over, but the 
judgment continues, said Yoon 
Kyong-hee, a student leader.
After a two-hour rally, the protest
ers broke through a police barricade 
and spilled into the 12-lane boule
vard in front of the embassy. Police 
rushed to occupy five lanes to keep 
back the protesters, who hurled 
dozens of eggs at the building. No 
serious injuries were reported.
In the past, anti-American protests 
had usually attracted small numbers 
of activists. Most of Saturdays pro
testers were ordinary citizens who 
ignored South Korean President Kim 
Dae-jungs warning that antiAmericanism and demands for the 
withdrawal of US troops hurt South 
Koreas national interest.
Because of the protest, a delegation 
of US lawmakers led by 
Representative Henry Hyde, R-Ill., 
canceled a trip to Seoul on Saturday. 
Hyde did not want the delegation to 
become the focal point of demonstra
tions here, the embassy said in a brief 
statement. Hydes delegation had 
planned to fly to Seoul on Saturday 
from Japan. The embassy said Hyde 
will visit at a less sensitive time.

Wiccan sues county 
for discrimmination
RICHMOND, Va. (AP)  A woman 
who practices a religion rooted in 
witchcraft is suing county officials for 
refusing to add her name to a list of 
clergy invited to open board meetings 
with a prayer.
The American Civil Liberties Union 
and Americans United for Separation 
of Church and State filed the lawsuit 
Friday in US District Court on behalf 
of Cynthia Simpson, a Wiccan.
The lawsuit claims the Chesterfield 
County Board of Supervisors board 
discriminated against Simpson based 
on her religion by inviting Christian 
clergy to deliver invocations while 
refusing to allow her to do so.
The countys treatment of Ms. 
Simpson amounts to the marking of 
Wicca with an official badge of dis
honor, the lawsuit says. It repre
sents nothing less than overt, official 
governmental disapproval of a reli
gious tradition.
The lawsuit accuses the board of 
violating the First Amendments free
dom of religion and separation of 
church and state clauses, as well as 
the constitutional guarantee of equal 
protection.
The county supervisors shouldnt 
be sponsoring prayers at all, but 
when they do, they certainly cant 
play favorites," said the Reverend 
Barry W. Lynn, executive director of 
Americans United.
However; the events of recent 
months and, in particular; of

Athletes win suit, 
$11 million each
(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA (UWIRE)  When most athletes 
change clothes in the locker room 
after a long practice or a tough 
game, they never imagine that their 
naked bodies are being caught on 
camera.
But thats exactly what happened 
to several University of 
Pennsylvania athletes sometime 
between 1996 and 1998. And last 
week, the former students were 
each awarded $11 million in com
pensatory and punitive damages.
The students were filmed by cam
eras hidden in a shower of a univer
sity athletic facility. Clips from these 
films were spliced together and sold 
as pornographic videos with titles 
like Straight off the Mat. In addi
tion, portions of the videos were 
shown on the Internet to coax view
ers into purchasing them.
The Penn students were not the 
only victims of the pornographic 
scam, however. The students attor
ney, Cindy Fluxgold, represented a 
total of 46 student athletes filmed in 
locker rooms across the country 
between 1995 and 1999.
Fluxgold said all of the students 
were either football players or 
wrestlers but would not specify 
which Penn team the scam involved.

Yale students may

NEW YORK (U-WIRE)  Seventysix undergraduate students at Yale 
University filed formal charges 
against Yale President Richard Levin 
Thursday, claiming he violated uni

If Levin is convicted by the

Another charge states that Levin

said he and other students were 
leafletting near the Woolsey 
Rotunda on campus and were 
harassed by police.
Repeatedly, President Levin 
was asked why it happened, 
Frampton said. According to 
Frampton, Levin said leafletting is 
not allowed in that area, which 
prompted him and others to 
research Yale policies.
The third and fourth charges 
listed claim Levin has violated 
Yales Freedom of Expression 
Policy, stifling free speech through 
the use of university police.
Theres a lot of students that 
feel marginalized and intimidat

Yale spokesman Tom Violante 
declined to comment. The letter 
from the students says that the 
charges are not a personal attack 
on Levin.
We are asking nothing more

New fire chief dies 
of heart attack
CARNEGIE, Pa. (AP)  The newly 
elected chief of a western 
Pennsylvania fire company died from 
a heart attack Saturday as he battled 
a fire at an auto repair shop that sent 
flames shooting 30 feet in the air and 
blew up tow trucks.
Henry Wissel, a 33-year member of 
the Heidelberg Volunteer Fire 
Company who was elected chief on 
Thursday, suffered a heart attack 
while pulling equipment out of a fire 
truck in Heidelberg, a suburb south of 
Pittsburgh.
Wissel, 55, was among the fire
fighters from at least six companies 
that fought the Saturday morning fire 
at the Thomas Body Shop, which was 
reduced to ashes and burned hulks of 
tow trucks.
It was blazing was up, 20 feet, 30 
feet up in the air, and it kept popping 
and blowing up. Those trucks in there 
were just blowing up, said A1 Mass, 
81, former chief of the fire company.
Allegheny County Fire Marshal Bob 
Full said the fire caused $250,000 of 
damage to the body shop and a neigh
boring home, where one man 
escaped without injury. Full said the 
fire was apparently accidental.
Duquesne alum 
jailed for theft
PITTSBURGH (AP)  A former 
Duquesne University student was 
sentenced to four months of house 
arrest and three years probation for 
stealing equipment from a university 
and selling it over the Internet.
A federal judge on Friday also 
ordered Joshua John Pipic, 20, of 
Dormont, to pay $29,409 for stealing 
eight projectors from Duquesne 
University in Pittsburgh and selling 
some to people in Florida and 
Virginia.
Prosecutors said Pipic stole the pro
jectors between November 2001 and 
April and sold five of them over the 
Internet. During a search of his home 
in April , FBI agents found three of the 
projectors, prosecutors said.
Pipic pleaded guilty in September 
and was convicted of interstate trans
portation of stolen property. He also 
pleaded guilty to drug possession 
after agents found Ecstasy tablets and 
psilocin, in the form of hallucinogenic 
mushrooms, in his room.
Pipic did not have a listed phone 
number and could not be reached for 
omment Friday evening by The 
Associated Press.

Masturbation in 
library decreases
TUCSON, Ariz. (U-WIRE)  
Flashers, masturbators and other 
sexual perpetrators have been 
coming to the University of 
Arizona Main Library to test out 
pickup lines, pleasure themselves, 
and expose their genitalia for 
years.
In the library during the last 
month alone there have been three 
incidents of masturbation, one of 
indecent exposure and two cases of 
a man asking students to sketch 
their feet, one of which was cou
pled with masturbation.
Due to these recent incidents  
and common unwanted sexual 
advances  some students are 
becoming hesitant to study at, or 
even go to, the Main Library.
It was on the fourth floor. This 
older guy, he must have been in his 
40s, kept on walking up to all the 
girls and talking to us, said aero
space engineering first-year Ariel 
Marsh. All the girls left and then I 
was the only one there, and he just 
kept staring at me. So I left too.
The number of cases of sexual 
offenses in 2002 is actually down 
compared to 2001. But many of the 
incidents that bother students go 
unreported, or are not considered 
crimes, said University of Arizona 
Police Department Commander 
Brian Seastone.
On November 12, a female stu
dent reported that a man asked to 
sketch her feet for an art class. She 
agreed, but looked up a couple
minutes later and saw the man 
masturbating.
Two days later, there was anoth
er report of a man asking students 
to sketch their feet. Both incidents 
occurred near midnight.
Student extolls 
virtues of hugging
IOWA CITY, Iowa (U-WIRE)  
University of Iowa freshman 
Benjamin Benjy Schirm not only 
talks to strangers, he hugs them, 
too  up to 100 in a day.
Spinning slowly behind the 
Pappajohn Business Building on 
Thursday afternoon, decked out in 
a blue jumpsuit painted with the 
words Hug Me, eyes wide and 
smiling, Schirm opened his arms 
as students rushed up and hugged 
him.
In his first half-hour, the 
Plymouth, Minnesota native 
gave/received approximately 20 
hugs, ending the day with 40 after 
45 minutes outside.
So many people walking 
around arent smiling and dont 
look happy, so as long as I can 
make someone smile, its all worth 
it, said Schirm.
He also sported a Santa hat 
Thursday in light of the holidays.
What started as a rhetoric 
assignment has netted the theater 
and dance major more than 200 
hugs since he first began doling 
out love four weeks ago.
The assignment that brought on 
the hugging frenzy called for stu
dents to find the best medium for 
conveying a message.
He won the class contest for the 
best idea, winning a yo-yo and an

Students carol for 
living-wage rights
On Friday, People for Workers Rights 
(PWR), organized a demonstration 
near the UC food court as part of their 
Living Wage and Workers Rights 
Campaign. The group, concerned that 
CMUs dining services workers are 
treated unfairly, had been tabling for 
the cause since Thursday.
The highlight of the demonstration 
was the PWR (along with members of 
Amnesty International and the 
Progressive Student Alliance) singing 
Christmas carols to the workers, tradi
tional lyrics having been replaced 
with political ones. For instance, to 
the tune of Jingle Bells, the students 
sang:
(Chorus) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jin
gle all the way,
Dining workers all deserve to make a 
living wageHEY!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the 
way,
Greedy Parkhurst keeps it all but were 
gonna make em pay!
I work for Parkhurst  the abuse it 
never stops,
No pay, no benefits  somebody call 
the cops!
Were with PWR  weve beat sweat
shops before,
Weve seen this crime on our campus 
and we wont take it no more!
Repeat Chorus
Im President CohonI makealotof 
dough,
But when PWR asks for a living wage,
I tell themno! 
The students also spoke briefly with 
the workers, gave out presents (PWR 
buttons and fair trade chocolates). 
The groups wanted to make it clear to 
the workers that they are behind them
and that they feel the University treats 
them unfairly. The workers were 
appreciative of the display of student 
support, saying student support is one 
of the best ways of enacting change at 
CMU. Administrators were not avail
able for comment on PWRs demon
stration.
Design students to 
craft Schenley Park
This Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon 
Design students will present propos
als for the redevelopment of the 
Panther Hollow Lake in Schenley 
Park.
The exhibit is part of a senior 
design studio project and will display 
ideas for new landscapes, building, 
and art installations aimed at spark-! 
ing public interest in the lake's 
restoration.
Today, the Hollow is a stark con-, 
trast to its glory days, with the paths 
overgrown and the lake largely stag
nant. Additionally, access to the 
Hollow itself is difficult and 
unmarked.
Earlier in the century, Panther 
Hollow was a hugely popular recrej 
ational space which included a pic
turesque boathouse among other 
recreational facilities. Oakland resi
dents enjoyed boat rides as well as 
swimming in the lake and many walk
ing paths around the park. - *
When developing the potential 
plans for Panther Hollow, the sites 
history and ecological condition were 
heavily considered. Possible uses of 
the hollow included a new arboretum 
and boating area.
Schenley Park and the other city 
parks provided a respite from indus
trial grime when Pittsburgh was  a! 
center of steel manufacturing. The 
City of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh 
Parks Conservancy have been work
ing to revitalize the walking paths, 
structures and ecosystems of the 
citys park system since 1998. New 
paths and a Visitor Center have 
already been added to Schenley Park, 
the first emphasis of the 
Conservancys efforts.
Elegantly furnished one- or two-bedroom apartment suites include an equipped kitchen, 
fluffy linens, TV, VCR, cable movies, free local phone service, and reserved parking.
Conveniently located at 5405 Fifth Avenue, Shadyside. Two blocks from Walnut Street s

Noose left on Pitt 
professors desk
PITTSBURGH (U-WIRE)  
University of Pittsburgh assistant 
professor of English Stefan 
Wheelock entered his empty lec
ture room before his introduction 
to critical reading class and discov
ered a miniature noose placed 
behind the lectern November 21.
Most students on campus, 
including Student Government 
Boards Multicultural Chair 
Courtney Richardson, did not find 
out until Thursday, December 5, 
nearly two weeks later.
My main concern is nobodys 
talking about it, and it needs to be 
talked about, Richardson said. 
Its a public matter and its a stu
dent matter.
Wheelock found the noose next 
to a copy of The Invisible Man, 
according to a December 5 article 
in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
The Invisible Man, a novel by a 
black author, Ralph Ellison, 
addressing racial issues, is standard 
reading for several critical reading 
classes, including Wheelocks.
Wheelock, who is black, con
fronted his class about the noose 
but nobody offered any informa
tion, he told the Post-Gazette.
He abandoned his lecture plans 
for the evening to discuss the sym
bolism of lynching and why he felt 
disturbed.
Pitt Police chief Tim Delaney said 
Pitt police began investigating 
when he found out late Monday, 
December 2.
He said it is difficult to catch 
someone committing an act of 
intimidation, but he will prosecute
anyone he catches to the full extent 
of the law.
Maria Smith, chair of Blackline, the 
official publication of the Black 
Action Society, said BAS is not taking 
the incident lightly and plans to pub
lish a story addressing the incident. 
She said she found out about it 
Monday but most of her information 
has been secondhand.
Smith said she felt this reflects 
greater trends of racial tensions at 
Pitt and said she hopes Wheelock will 
not change his teaching policies as a 
result.
Technology aids 
anthrax patients
(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH  Until 
recently, an alarming number of peo
ple displaying symptoms of anthrax 
poisoning could show up at hospitals 
and doctors offices within a region, 
but there would be no system to 
report the cases and raise alarm.
Thanks to new software known as 
the Real-time Outbreak and Disease 
Surveillance System, or RODs, peo
ple across Pennsylvania will know 
almost immediately if any hospitals 
see a sudden increase in symptoms 
indicative of a possible bioterrorist 
attack.
The software is now available for 
anyone to download for free. It can 
be accessed at the RODs Web site, US 
Senators Arlen Specter and Rick 
Santorum announced in conjunction 
with the BioMedical Security 
Institute last Monday.
RODs software, intended to be 
used by health departments or urban 
regions to identify the location of an 
outbreak, monitors and analyzes 
health information across 
Pennsylvania, according to a press 
release from the BioMedical Security 
Institute. The system collects data 
from emergency rooms, pharmacy 
companies, and poison centers.
Crime & Incident Policy
Members of the campus community are expected to be held accountable 
for their actions, whether it be in or out of the classroom. Therefore, names 
of individuals arrested or cited in violation of state, city, or federal law will 
appear in news stories and the Crime & Incident report. Out of respect for 
the Universitys alcohol amnesty policy, The Tartan does not identify recipi
ents of medical emergencies.
Unless otherwise noted, material appearing in C&I is based on the police 
blotter and incident reports. All names and addresses of complainants and 
victims are omitted from the C&I. Locations of incidents, on or off campus, 
will appear when applicable. Ethnic descriptions and other personal charac
teristics are given only in the context of complete descriptions. Not every 
incident that occurs appears in the report. Only three individuals view the 
incident reports obtained from Campus Police: the Editor-in-Chief, the News 
Editor, and the staffwriter compiling the report.

Housing to reduce off-campus space
y High court to judge race-based, admissions
"iJ Carnegie Mellon will back the University of Michigan, supporting racial admissions criteria
ADMISSIONS, from page A1
but banned rigid racial quotas in 
higher education.
I guess the concern is that the law 
will be made clear in a way that is bad 
for diversity, said Dively.
Since the Bakke case, universities 
have been pursuing students based 
on race, using affirmative action as 
they see fit and in many different 
incarnations.
For instance, CMU uses no specific 
calculations or numbers with regards 
to their admissions policies, although 
they do emphasize racial and general 
diversity.
Either you do or you dont [use 
race-based admissions policies]. 
CMU does, along with a wide variety 
of other considerations, in addition 
to the traditional academic reviews, 
said Bill Elliot, CMUs vice president 
for enrollment.
He noted that as important as 
diversity is to Carnegie Mellon, it is 
only considered after it has been 
established that the applicant can do 
the work and be academically suc
cessful.
UM considers race and diversity 
using the controversial point system. 
This system, according to the univer
sitys website, awards 20 points (the 
total possible is 150) to students who 
are from an under-represented racial 
minority  specifically, Blacks, 
Native Americans and Latinos.
Applicants can only earn up to 12 
points for high SAT or ACT scores. 
The highest percentage of points, by 
far, is awarded for a strong GPA (up 
to 80 points).
Universities are widely seen as a 
gateway to opportunity. What would 
the world be like if we didnt have this 
[race-based admissions standards]? 
If there would come a day when 
minority students would have access 
to higher education without affirma
tive action, I think all of us would 
gladly let go of it, said UM 
spokesperson Julie Peterson.
The university environment is 
richer when they [students] have 
many students around them who are 
different from themselves. Empirical 
studies have shown that diversity 
benefits every racial group, not just 
minorities, said Peterson, claiming 
that students excel in their studies as 
well as other aspects of university life 
when they are in a racially, as well as 
economically, socially, and politically 
diverse setting.
She said that taking active steps
towards diversity in the university 
setting is just as relevant and valu
able today as it was in 1978.
Everett Tademy, Carnegie Mellons 
director of Equal Opportunity 
Services, agrees.
I just dont see that things have 
changed that much. We still have a 
huge underclass, made up mainly of 
African Americans and Latinos. And 
whites, who benefit from it [racebased admissions policies] as well, 
said Tademy.
However, not everyone agrees that 
these racial standards, particularly as 
they are practiced at UM, are valu
able, constitutional, or even wholely 
ethical.
[I support] the fulfillment of what 
most Americans believe, and thats 
that your race shouldnt matter in 
something as important as where you 
go to school, said David Herr, the 
attorney presenting the undergradu
ate plaintiffs case. The idea of
[I support] the 
fulfillment of what 
most Americans 
believe, and thats 
that your race 
shouldnt matter in 
something as 
important as 
where you go to 
school.
David Herr, 
lawyer
applying different standards to differ
ent students is unconstitutional, and I 
think it always has been.
Herr does not oppose the idea of 
diversity in general. He said it is 
important that universities actively 
seek out applicants of a wide variety 
of races.
But thats clearly not what was 
going on at the University of 
Michigans undergraduate program. 
Those students a got a 20-point 
advantage because they fit into the
category of certain preferred races, 
he said.
Herr takes issue with the idea of 
actively seeking out some specific 
races, while ignoring others who 
might face similar circumstances.
He said that the policy only bene
fits African American, Latino, and 
Native American applicants, while 
other races who may be under repre
sented, such as Arabs, go unattended 
in the process.
Peterson defended this aspect of 
the policy on the grounds that those 
three groups are the least well repre
sented on campus, as well as on other 
campuses.
For example, she said that tools 
such as affirmative action are not 
needed to ensure that a satisfactory 
number of Asians make up the stu
dent body at UM.
She also argued that Michigan, as a 
state, sees more than its fair share of 
trouble with diversity, and notes that 
it is important to remember that the 
universitys policies are specific to its 
needs.
She said that Detroit is the most 
segregated city in the country and 
that Michigan is the third most segre
gated state.
Tademy agrees with the idea that a 
communities policies should reflect 
their specific issues.
All politics are local. Michigan 
understands what Michigan needs to 
do, he said.
Both critics and fans of affirmative 
action initiatives agree that it is prob
ably the most significant case to come 
before the Supreme Court in years, 
and almost all universities feel the 
need to get involved, including 
Carnegie Mellon.
We will be active in putting our 
views before the Supreme Court. 
Well either file our own Amicus Brief 
[a statement of ones position on a 
case], or well join someone elses, 
said Dively. We will definitely be 
supporting maximum flexibility for 
universities to promote and achieve 
diversity in student bodies. There 
arent many issues on which we 
would choose to file an Amicus Brief, 
but this is one of them.
Dively says that CMU will adhere 
to the courts ruling, whatever it is. 
She said that most private universi
ties tend to follow suit with policies 
and standards adopted by public uni
versities.
She speculates that the Supreme 
Courts ruling will affect public and 
private universities alike.
HOUSING, from page A1
percentage of upperclass students 
remaining in housing continues to 
increase from year to year.
Seventy-four percent of residents 
participated in the last springs room 
draw.
Mark Schmit, junior computer sci
ence major and Morewood resident, 
opted to live on campus primarily 
because of the high-speed Internet 
service and the close proximity to 
other campus buildings.
I like the bandwidth and that 
[the dorm] is a place to meet new 
people, said Schmit.
While Housing hopes that there 
will not be a need for temporary 
housing next fall, room shortages 
will likely be a problem again in the 
future.
The number of students placed in 
temporary housing has reached 90
in the past and is regularly used to 
accommodate surplus residents. In 
1999, however, it was not necessary,
I like the band
width and that 
[the dorm] is a 
place to meet new 
people.
Mark Schmit, 
junior CS major
according to Michael.
If necessary, Housing offers finan
cial incentives to residents who 
move off-campus in the first weeks
of classes. In most years double the 
deposit is given.
To keep costs low, Housing strives 
to keep the number of room vacan
cies to a minimum, which means 
ensuring that the supply does not 
grow too quickly.
The next significant change to 
occur in Housing will be the restruc
turing of the area along Margaret 
Morrison Street near Forbes Avenue. 
Michael said that the density at the 
corner can be increased significantly 
to double the number of beds avail
able there.
This plan will likely not be carried 
out for several years.
Despite increased demand for 
campus housing, Michael said 
Housing Services is focused on con
tinuing its guarantee that space will 
be available each year to students 
that do not leave the campus hous
ing system.

Student designs anti-apathy course CMU opposes half percent payroll tax
Fifth-year scholar wants to see Carnegie Mellon students more involved with Pittsburgh community
by Matt Rado
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellons reputation for stu
dent apathy was very apparent to Lara 
Panis by the end of her senior year. 
Panis, a fifth-year scholar, saw her own 
friends become apathetic, which led her 
to join the fifth-year scholars program.
In the spring semester, Panis will pilot 
a new course tided Carnegie Mellon 
and the Community. The course, to be 
taught by Edwin Fenton, emeritus pro
fessor of history, intends to help firstyears better enjoy their experiences and 
help them make the most of the oppor
tunities available at CMU and in 
Pittsburgh.
The aim of the course is to take the 
first-years, the freshman, and help him 
with the transition from high school, 
and also help him to transition, not only 
into the college life, but into the 
Pittsburgh community, said Panis.
According to Paniss course outline, 
the nine unit semester-long course is 
designed to help students gain the skills 
they need to succeed and explore pro
grams that connect them to CMU and 
the Pittsburgh community. Some stu
dents, however, are doubtful about the 
success of the course.
First-year drama major Elizabeth 
Buckser said that student involvement 
could be somewhat of a problem here.
Its hard for people here to get 
involved because people are so into aca
demics, she said. She also said many 
who attend CMU know what they want 
to do and simply see themselves here for 
academics. This course hopes to involve 
students through readings, watching 
films, listening to guest speakers, and 
visiting cultural sites around Pittsburgh.
Adam Sharick, a first-year mechani
cal engineering major, said that many 
students are focused on their college 
experience and not as much on whats 
going on in Pittsburgh. There are a lot 
of people that arent from around here, 
implying out-of-towners are just natu
rally disinterested in their temporary 
home.
The class will end with a final project 
in which students identify areas, that 
need to be improved in the city or at the 
University, and propose a plan of action. 
Although now primarily a humanitiesstyle course, with a strong emphasis on 
reading and writing, Panis said it might 
eventually be changed to fit other styles 
of students.
Panis said that all of this would hope
fully allow for self development in stuBrad Yankiver/Assistant Photo Editor

dents, in which they gain the knowledge 
to get what they want out of their entire 
CMU experience.
Panis began her project by analyzing 
what themes of the Carnegie Mellon 
experience did and did not work. This 
led her to investigate the social and aca
demic aspects of the experience and to 
study their relationship. She said that 
many first-years come to the CMU expe
rience very enthusiastic and involved. 
Soon, she says, this energy declines as 
they approach senior year, and apathy 
among the students increases.
I think theres apathy in all respects. 
I think the academics just really take 
over, said Panis. It is this concern over a 
lack of student involvement in the 
school and the community that led Lara 
Panis to conceive of such a project.
According to Michelle Grab, the 
director of the fifth-year scholars pro
gram, participants are supposed to pro
pose projects that somehow benefit the 
Pittsburgh community or Carnegie 
Mellon. Grab said Laras project hopes 
to help to first-years work to improve 
their experience on campus. Students 
involved in the fifth year scholar pro
gram are given a $7,000 stipend for any 
purpose that they desire. Panis said she 
has not yet had to use any of the money 
for her project.
Another aspect of Panis project has 
been first-year discussion groups 
designed to study ways to impact the 
first-year experience. These groups,
composed of about 20 students, were in 
a setting that allowed students to come 
forward and talk about any issues or 
concerns they had about CMU. Groups 
have discussed first-year orientation 
and dining, among other issues. 
According to Panis, CMU has a very 
good orientation, but she would like to 
see more events for entire classes to par
ticipate in, Clippership being an exam
ple. Panis has proposed the return of 
class officers, which she would like to 
see as planning class wide social events. 
Panis said many students are familiar 
with the class Clippership activities dur
ing freshman and senior years, but that 
CMU lacks major classwide events dur
ing other times.
Food was a big issue. A lot of us were 
against th meal plan. We met with din
ing and housing officials, said Vijay 
Chandrasekhar, a participant in the dis
cussion groups and first-year CIT stu
dent.
Student Elizabeth Buckser, also 
involved in Panis discussion groups, 
was satisfied with the experience. It is 
important that there are people that 
care about what we think, said 
Buckser.
Discussions groups will continue 
monthly next semester.
Panis, an international relations 
major and Delta Gamma alumni, cur
rently devotes most of her time to the 
project. She is also the community advi
sor for Resnik and West Wing.

TAXES, from page A1
Kwiecinski, Mayor Tom Murphys spokesperson.
Nearly 30 percent of the citys property is exempt 
from real estate taxes. As well, many of its major 
employers, 17 out of 24 (including CMU), are taxexempt because they are universities, hospitals or 
other non-profit organizations.
In addition to proposing new, fair tax proposals 
such as the payroll preparation tax and the 10 per
cent by the drink tax, we are also trying to find a way 
to ease the tax burden on others such as property 
owners and small business owners. We are looking to 
reduce the cost of the city government through 
spending reductions, said Kwiecinski.
Murphys budget proposes trimming the citys 
work force by 20 percent and merging the citys EMS 
and fire bureaus.
After the payroll tax proposals were made, CMU 
stated that it already aids the city in much of its bud
getary problems.
Carnegie Mellon supports the economic health of 
the city as one of its largest employers with 3,800 
jobs, as a purchaser of goods and services, and as a 
provider of world-class higher education to some 
8,600 students annually, all of whom spend money 
in the city of Pittsburgh, the University press release 
stated.
Our employees also pay wage and state tax and 
the university pays real estate and amusement taxes. 
In fact, Carnegie Mellons economic impact on 
Allegheny County is an estimated $746 million each 
year.
The University is also keenly aware of the financial 
difficulties that the city is in and has been an impor
tant part of the efforts to help restore some balance 
to the citys finances, said Don Smith, vice president 
for economic development of the Mellon Pitt 
Carnegie Corporation.
While were very supportive of the attempt to 
restore some balance to the citys finances, this par
ticular payroll tax proposal would be fairly onerous 
and so we are actively seeking to work with the city 
on an alternative, said Smith.
Because the tax would be such a burden on, the 
University, CMU has offered its services to a conimittee organized by Governor-elect Ed RendelJ .that 
would work to address the citys budget deficit and 
taxing structure.
A vast amount of non-profit organizations (n the 
city have voiced opposition to this plan. This 'will 
undoubtedly affect health and social services, in, the 
region and our school will feel its effects in some of 
our priority initiatives for the university, said Smith.
The city does not deny that the University, has 
been an important driving force behind Pittsburghs 
new economy, but cannot ignore the lack of balance 
in the citys tax structure.
Theres no doubt that the universities Have 
become a driving force behind Pittsburghs .pew 
economy, but at the end of the day, not everyone is 
paying their fair share when it comes to the tax bur
den of the city, said Kwiecinski.
This new tax is about reform and bringing our tax 
structure into the 21st century to reflect the city we 
are today. 
Strauss said that if the payroll tax is approved by 
the state General Assembly, CMU will feel some of 
the repercussions.
If the city goes through with the payroll tax, CMU 
will do the arithmetic and pay it by decelerating its 
wage increases and its going to come out ofLour 
hides. In terms of tuition, they are talking about a 5 
to 10 percent increase in tuition prices, said Strauss.
The tuition increase will be combined with other 
budgeting strategies to take care of the estimated 
one million dollars a year that this tax would cost the 
university, said Smith.
Until the tax is passed, all the University car^do is 
wait to see its future. Strauss believes, however,-that 
the urgency is a necessary agent to helping the.city 
realize that this budget deficit is a big problem. (
The mayor and city council are both in cars flay
ing chicken. Neither wants to let go of the gas and 
they dont care if they go down, as long as th other 
goes with them, said Strauss. In front of them is a 
concrete wall and right now, we are at the ^point 
where we can see the mortar between the bricks.
Namey vetoes Chief Doyle apologize

we deserve to know how our money 
is spent, said Colin Jarvis, a firstyear computer science major.
Renato Clavijo, a sophomore biolo
gy major, said, Without that bill 
being passed, there could be a lot of 
corruption. It does not seem right to 
not know what were paying for.
Still, Namey questions the viability 
and legality of the bill, while main
taining that he supports freedom of 
information. Steenhuis believs that 
Namey ought to have voiced his 
objections prior to the vote.
Its a little astonishing actually,

How Stuff Works: The 
piezoelectric effect
by Joe Elliott
Staffwriter
The secret to smooth downhill 
skiing may be in your alarm clock. 
Scientists can now turn bumps and 
shakes into heat using materials 
like the quartz in an alarm clock. 
Its a phenomenon known as piezo
electricity, which is an electric cur
rent that forms in certain crystals 
as a result of mechanical stress. 
Also important is the reverse piezo
electric effect mechanical defor
mation in response to an applied 
electric potential.
Ski manufacturer K2 embeds 
piezoelectric materials in some of 
their skis and snowboards to con
vert the energy from performanceharming vibrations into electrical 
energy that can be dissipated as 
heat rather than perpetuating the 
vibration. By fine-tuning the piezo
electric materials and the circuitry 
involved, they can dampen the 
most detrimental vibration fre
quencies that occur when skiing on 
hard snow. Similar technology has 
also been applied to vibration 
damping in water skis.
Piezoelectricity was discovered 
in 1880 by Pierre Curie (of radium/ 
polonium fame) and his brother 
Jacques. Their experiment consist
ed of applying mechanical stress to 
specially prepared crystals (includ
ing tourmaline, quartz, cane sugar, 
and Rochelle salt) and measuring 
the surface charges. They named 
the phenomenon that they 
observed piezoelectricity from 
the Greek verb piezein, meaning to 
press.
The first practical application of 
piezoelectricity was sonar, devel
oped in World War I. (Sonar works 
by bouncing sound waves off of 
objects to see them, and the precise-frequency sound waves are 
generated by a vibrating piezoelec
tric material.)
After World War II, man-made 
piezoelectric materials opened up 
a new range of possibilities  bet
ter sonar, higher-quality record 
players, tiny speakers, and micro
phones  the list goes on. One of 
the most common applications are 
piezoelectric igniters  gas grills 
and pushbutton cigarette lighters 
generate a spark voltage by com
pressing a piezoelectric pill.
Piezoelectric technology has also 
made high-quality microphones 
compact and affordable. The next 
time you fit your cell phone into 
your pocket, you should thank the 
piezoelectric effect; it would be 
much bulkier without it!
Quartz clocks also rely on the 
reverse piezoelectric effect to keep 
accurate time. A piezoelectric crys
tal (in this case quartz) vibrates 
with a specific frequency when its 
placed in an oscillating electric 
field. That vibration keeps time 
much more accurately than a 
mechanical movement could. The 
tiny buzzers on alarms, beepers, 
doorbells, and other noise-making 
devices also rely on the reverse 
piezoelectric effect to make a mate
rial vibrate at just the right fre
quency to produce the desired 
sound.
The piezoelectric effect is 
explained by the displacement of 
ions (atoms that have lost one or 
more of their electrons and are 
electrically charged) in certain 
crystals. When the crystal is com
pressed, ions in each unit cell are 
displaced, causing electric polar
ization of the unit cell. Due to the 
uniformity of crystal structures, 
these effects accumulate, creating 
an electric potential difference 
between two faces of the crystal. In 
the case of the reverse piezoelectric 
effect, an electric potential is 
applied to the crystal, ions are dis
placed by electrostatic forces, 
resulting in deformation of the 
entire crystal.

Modders find creative additions to computer decor
by Alexander Meseguer
Assistant Science & Technology Editor
Some people pierce their nipples 
or dye their hair to express them
selves. Not so in the realm of com
puters, where the equivalent is PC 
case modification, better known as 
modding or case modding. Most 
people see a personal computer as 
nothing more than a tool, with as 
much personality as a hammer or 
drill. Those few who dare to turn a 
bland, beige box into an ornate spec
tacle of design see computers as an 
extension of ones persona, repre
senting another arena to express 
oneself in a domain not traditionally 
thought of as having potential for 
creativity. A small but enthusiastic 
community of case modders exists 
here at Carnegie Mellon, known to 
house a large population of comput
er enthusiasts.
The case modding phenomenon 
doesnt appear to be very wide
spread on campus, even with the 
large numbers of computer enthusi
asts that attend. Nobody really has 
time to mod their case, but I know 
people who have insane computer 
systems, said Evan Small, sopho
more in mechanical engineering. I 
know people who run their comput
ers without cases. Carnegie 
Mellons intene educational envi
ronment does rot leave much room 
for a time-intensive hobby like case 
modding, but i unique aspect of 
modding is that't can be as minor as 
changing LEDs a as drastic as build
ing ones own cse from the ground 
up.
Case moddeis often start by 
aggressively maximizing the perfor
mance of their michines and end up 
wanting to go thit extra mile. Ive 
always liked commters ... I custombuilt my computer, overclocked 
[everything], filltd up all the hard 
drive slots, PCIs, and basically the 
whole computer was upgraded as 
much as it could be, said Andrew 
Dubois, a senior tin the School of 
Computer Sciencl. I couldnt do 
much more so I cecided, why not 
just go with aesthetics.
Modders like to weak their boxes 
with everything from custom auto
quality paint jobs :o carrying han
dles to make the jrequent treks to 
LAN parties more convenient. As 
Dubois attested, modding is not only 
meant to wow you; friends, but to 
squeeze every last bit of perfor
mance from available hardware. It is 
not unusual to fird CPUs, main

Youre sitting in a movie theater 
and the audience falls silent, basking 
in the poignant moment of beauty 
unfolding on the screen. Then a cell 
phone goes off. The jerk who 
received the call starts talking, and 
that moment is gone. Wouldnt it be 
nice to never have that happen 
again? Engineers in Japan have 
found a way to do just that.
Researchers at Iwata University in 
Japan have developed a building 
material that blocked approximately 
97 percent of the test signal. The 
material js made of a layer of zinc 
ferrite sandwiched between wood 
panels. It can be as thin as four mil
limeters and still be effective. This 
unobtrusiveness would allow it to be
used nearly anywhere without inter
fering with the decor.
This method of blockiiig calls may 
get around the Federal Communic
ation Commissions (FCCs) strin
gent regulations on blocking or jam
ming wireless signals. The operation 
of any device that causes malicious 
or willful interference is currently 
prohibited by 47 US Codje Sections 
301, 302a, and 333. These laws pro
hibit three of the five typeslof devices 
capable of interfering with transmis
sions, but do not clearly ban the two 
other types: devices which switch 
phones to vibrate mode, and devices 
which passively block all signals.
Why are these devices prohibited? 
The airways are considered a public 
resource, but the FCC needs to regu

quency. If they did not, it -yvould be 
difficult to have any sort of; commuAnnalisa Schaefer/Art Staff
nication, as groups would be inter
fering with each other on a regular 
basis. Once they divvy up a band
width for someone to use, most ways 
to block or interfere with messages 
sent on that bandwidth would 
involve sending out another mes
sage. Therefore, active blockers try 
to get around the FCCs allotment to 
prevent calls from working.
Some advocates of signal blocking 
have argued that property rights 
give property owners control over 
the airspace above their property. 
Already, restaurants are able to regu
late what is in the air in the way of 
cigarette smoke. But, unlike bans on 
smoking, some cell blockers can 
extend beyond the bounds of the 
property area. First, most active 
blockers work by sending out a com
peting signal. Generally, the signals 
go out in a circular pattern, so the
issue of leakage can be important. 
Passive blockers dont have leakage 
in the same way, but their always 
being on brings with it separate 
problems.
Stuart Weiler, a sophomore 
mechanical/biomedical and health 
engineering major, is a member of an 
ambulance group. As a student, he 
feels the same way as most people 
when someone is inconsiderate of 
others with their cell phone. As an 
emergency medical technician, he 
knows that those wavelengths can 
be used for more critical communi
cation. The purpose of 911 is to 
respond to an emergency as quickly 
as possible, and blocking it could 
interfere with services, he said. 
When emergency personnel arrive, 
they often make calls to an ambu
lance to hurry if an injury is serious, 
or to request permission to perform a 
procedure. While active cell phone 
blockers could presumably have an 
override that would shut off the 
blocking signal, entering an area 
with passive cell phone blocking 
would be the same as entering a 
dead zone, requiring the EMT to 
move back out of the area in order to 
make the call.
The FCC currently has no plans to 
review the parts of the US Code that 
apply to cell phone blockers. A 
change in policy on wireless jam
ming technology by Canada or 
Mexico would require the United 
States to review its policy by Chapter 
13 of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. In 2001, Canada did 
consider legalization of jammers, 
but ultimately decided against it.
New cellular phones allow for 
ringer volume to be adjusted or have 
a vibrate function. Most of the prob
lems that cell phones cause are a 
result of people being inconsiderate, 
not a failing of the technology.
As Weiler said, Ideally, people 
should turn off their cell phones dur
ing a performance, but that isnt real 
life.

SAE wins competition and 
prepares for Formula race
byJohnDavin
Science & Technology Editor
Racing along a wooden track with 
inclines, rock pits, water trenches, and 
jumps is no easy task. CMLPs Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE) showed 
that it was up to the challenge when it 
took first place in the SAE Micro Baja 
competition last month. The annual 
competition was held in Detroit, 
Michigan, from November 18 to 20.
In the Micro Baja competition, teams 
compete with modified vehicles simi
lar to remote-controlled cars. The cars 
are raced on a one foot-wide wooden 
track, and are scored based on a com
bination of finishing times and design 
and presentation qualities.
The CMU team entered five cars and 
scored first, second, and third place in 
the modified stock class and first and 
second place in the unlimited class. 
The modified stock class allows use of 
only off-the-shelf remote controlled 
cars purchased from stores such as 
Radio Shack. The unlimited class 
allows almost any modifications, and 
encourages using a RC hobby kit as a 
base. In the modified stock class, CMU 
was competing with Central Michigan 
University. In the unlimited class, the 
team ran against Central Michigan, 
North Carolina State University, St. 
Clair College, and University of 
Detroit-Mercy.
CMUs winning car in the unlimited 
category is named Frankenstein, and 
features an active steering system that 
helps the car to turn. However, Peter 
Castelli, a junior in mechanical engi
neering and CMU SAE chairperson, 
said that complicated features are usu
ally not necessary. The simplest idea 
usually works the best, he said. For 
example, Castelli said that intelligent 
throttle control, which can adjust the 
power of the car when going up 
inclines or overjumps, is not really use
ful. He said the CMU team concen
trates on developing consistent and 
reliable power delivery.
Dan Gielas, a senior in mechanical 
engineering and CMU SAEs vice presi
dent of Micro Baja, attributes their suc
cess last month to the teams experi
ence in the competition. They have 
been competing for over ten years, and 
have been able to learn from their mis
takes to improve each year.
The CMU SAE organization is about 
50 years old, and currently has 62 stu
dent members, with 15 to 20 actively 
involved.
SAE also participates in the Formula 
race car competition. The team com
peted in the race last year, and is work
ing on a new car for the 2003 competi
tion. The Formula race cars use 
engines up to 610 cubic centimeters 
(cc) and can reach speeds up to 120 
miles per hour. According to Castelli, 
the Formula race is the toughest com
petition, requiring the most money 
and involvement. The competition 
involves over 100 schools, including 
universities from Japan, Canada, and 
England.
SAE team members spend a lot of 
time on the cars, but feel the experi
ence is valuable hands-on learning that

they would not be able to get in the class
room. Castelli and Gielas said that in their 
classes they learn a lot of equations, but 
real world applications such as the cars do 
not always follow a set formula, and 
require more of an intuitive understanding 
of the requirements. The SAE projects have 
also helped students develop connections 
with automotive companies. Auto compa
nies often use the Formula competition as a 
recruitment grounds.
Although our grades suffer doing this, 
the industry also realizes the benefits of 
this, said Castelli. We have a lot of people 
that are now high up in the auto industry.
If you build a really cool car, youre 
going to get offered some really cool jobs, 
said Gielas.
The CMU team receives its funding pri
marily from corporate sponsorship. Ford 
Motor Company, Caterpillar, General 
Motors, and other companies sponsor SAE 
Formula cars. CMU SAE solicits sponsors 
each year and generally receives a grant of 
$10,000 to $15,000. Funding varies great
ly between the SAE Formula teams from 
different universities. Cornell University, 
which has a larger and more established 
team, has a budget of $100,000 to 
$110,000.
According to Gielas, the Micro Baja com
petition is a good starting point for becom
ing involved with SAE because it is the eas
iest and requires the least time commit
ment.

Pittsburghs climb to top requires 
University letting down its hair
THE TARTANPage AlO
Bum Lee/Art Editor
Whistleblowers needed for Cohon, Warner Hall
Pittsburgh lacks a viable transit system 
and grass-roots cultural programs, accord
ing to a report submitted to City Council 
several weeks ago by two young 
researchers. Their findings come as no sur
prise to college students who continually 
complain of a lack of rail transit and a 
vibrant art scene. The findings identify one 
of the biggest challenges for the region: col
lecting broad input and assessment by the 
demographic group most likely to lead any 
type of Pittsburgh resurgence. This report, a 
redevelopment plan for Schenley Plaza, and 
another for Oakland, finally recognize the 
integral role this neighborhood and its ten
ants will have in economic revitalization.
But government planning and tax dollars 
are bounded solutions to the regions woes. 
A healthy transit system would certainly 
allow college students to explore beyond 
the city proper. More underground art and 
music shows would expand on an already 
unique and underappreciated city culture. 
But this phoenix will only rise from the 
ashes if leading local experts and adminis
trators husband the available resources of 
this city.
Pittsburgh has hitched its future to 
Carnegie Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh. As much as civic boosters and 
optimists laud the construction of ballparks, 
malls, and new highways (didnt that brand 
of urban planning disappear in the 1960s?), 
they fail to address a crumbling infrastruc
ture  whether it be education, finances, or 
even the sewer pipes. The University has 
contributed mightily to the regions techno
logical success. But for every new contract 
with NASA to build robots or every partner
ship with Intel to develop software, too 
many quality of life aspects are ignored by 
the intellectual capital of western 
Pennsylvania.
When Mayor Tom Murphys brightest idea 
for Oakland involves converting the
Many students join The Tartan to gain 
experience in reporting, media writing, and 
editing. Once on staff, they attend studentled workshops to learn journalism basics. 
They are paired with experienced staffers 
for individual tutoring. They receive listings 
of media internships and help with the com
pilation of their writing portfolios. Sadly, 
there are few other opportunities at the 
University for education and professional 
guidance in the field of journalism. 
However valuable experience on a college 
newspaper may be, students are missing out 
on the benefits of legitimate journalism 
courses taught by seasoned professors and 
journalists.
In an English department that boasts a 
variety of specialized degrees in profession
al, creative, and technical writing at both 
the undergraduate and graduate levels, it is 
not unreasonable for students to expect 
ample and consistent course offerings in 
journalism  a field that incorporates ele
ments of all types of writing taught at CMU. 
Although the undergraduate course catalog 
twice mentions that the professional writing 
program caters to students interested in 
journalism, courses available in the field are 
few and far between.
Each semester, the English department 
offers a journalism workshop, where stu
dents produce articles for the faculty and 
staff newspaper. Beyond that, the depart
ment offers an average of one course per 
semester, often in contemporary journalism 
or news writing. Specialized courses includ
ing literary and magazine journalism have 
been unavailable for several years. In the 
upcoming spring semester, students will 
have to settle for science writing as the
Schenley Plaza parking lot into a $6.75 mil
lion chrysanthemum refuge, its time for a 
steadier hand to steer the neighborhoods 
renewal.
We suggest the University and President 
Cohon accept this new challenge. Carnegie 
Mellons Center for Economic Development 
(CED) targets four areas of importance in its 
mission to revivify the region: technology, 
entrepreneurship, talent, and the role of 
universities in innovation. It is funny how all 
four of these points involve the input and 
participation of the young, yet a clarion call 
from Warner Hall has been noticeably mute. 
Any serious undertaking on matters of such 
economic import for Oakland, Pittsburgh 
and the rest of the region deserves a deci
sive leader. Carnegie Mellon, collaborating 
with other public, private, and non-profit 
entities, could help steer Pittsburgh towards 
change, not just sappy beautification pro
jects.
Let the change start locally. Oakland is 
Pittsburghs medical, cultural, educational 
and technological hub, possibly all of south
west Pennsylvanias. Take a page from those 
research results and utilize available rail 
systems to provide trolley access to and 
from Oakland into shopping hubs like 
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside. Work to scale 
back the red tape in zoning and building 
codes, and open up bidding competition 
among various entertainment venues. A 
number of the underused facilities dotting 
the area would be a good starting point for 
this competitive reallocation. Surely the 
University is as equipped for promoting 
business incubation as it is in matters of 
biotech investment, which the CED has 
been involved with in prior years.
It is no longer a question of whether CMU 
can lead the change in Oakland and 
Pittsburgh writ large, it is whether this 
administration, especially President Cohon, 
will let the city in to allow it.
sole specialized journalism course. At a 
university that prides its varied writing pro
grams, it is unfathomable that over the 
course of four years, no more than two gen
eral journalism courses and one specialized 
course are offered.
A course catalog description of the profes
sional writing program states students 
interested in journalism...are encouraged 
to take courses in history and political sci
ence. This is an excellent suggestion for a 
well-rounded background in journalism. 
However, before the program can pawn its 
students off to other departments for sup
plementary coursework, it should at least 
provide them with a significant knowledge 
of rudimentary journalism skills.
If the English department is uncertain 
about how to develop and teach journalism 
courses, then it needs to turn to other col
leges and universities for guidance. If the 
department is lacking faculty experienced 
in journalism, then it needs to start hiring. 
At the very least, a journalism track  one 
supported by frequent, high- quality courses 
 should be developed within the profes
sional writing program.
The Tartan does the best it can to provide 
its student writers with the tools to pursue a 
future in the journalism field. But without 
the opportunity to take a substantial num
ber of relevant courses, those students will 
lack the education needed to succeed in 
such a highly competitive profession and 
will reflect poorly on both the English 
department and the University.
The Tartan currently bears the burden of 
serving as the ad hoc journalism program at 
Carnegie Mellon. Its time for the English 
department to share some of the load.

Im not sure exactly what I was to give or 
gain by writing these last two weeks. Maybe 
I wanted to sound off, but ranting is a task

Id apply for Commencement speaker. But 
writing about Carnegie Mellon comes natu

column a few more bones of contention? So, 
in the interest of readership....
There are a lot of Carnegie conspiracy

I dont often like stating the obvious. After 
all, why waste valuable space repeating 
common knowledge? But this is worth 
repeating: Gisele Bundchen is hot. So is Tyra 
Banks. Not to leave out Heidi Klum (shes 
single again, by the way). In fact, all the 
ladies of the Victorias Secret Fashion Show 
are gorgeous. Which makes me wonder why 
CFA doesnt have a school of modeling. But I 
digress. Needless to say, I thought the show, 
which aired on November 20, was great, 
despite the endless commercial and musical 
interruptions.
Unfortunately, I was recently shocked to 
discover that not everyone agrees with me. 
This heresy has come from two primary
Decisions are made in the best interest of a 
department, college, or the University, 
respectively. The problem is that at a place 
where diversity of skin color is lauded, 
diversity of opinion is shunned. If a student 
thinks Carnegie Mellon is making poor deci
sions, well, it really doesnt matter. The stu
dent attrition rate, a measure of people who 
leave the University between the freshman 
and sophomore years, has fallen by over 100 
percent in the last decade and has hovered 
near 7 percent for the past several years. But 
theres a difference between staying here 
and feeling that you are a part of CMU. Its 
an especially important distinction for the 
Alumni House, which has the onerous task 
of increasing the paltry alumni giving rate.
But Im not convinced that President 
Jared Cohon knows how infectious student 
dissatisfaction or disinterest can be. For a 
vast majority of undergraduates, CMUs 
foibles  like dining and an unrepentantly 
apathetic student body  just may remain 
more vivid for alumni than the successes in
sources. First, Michael Copps, of the Federal 
Communications Commission, has called 
for a review of decency standards on the air. 
Second, some feminist and media watchdog 
groups have called the show degrading to 
women, asking CBS not to broadcast it. In 
the interest of public discourse and argu
ment concerning these important questions, 
I will attempt to respond to each of these 
points.
This is not the first time the FCC has been 
prompted to act by the Victorias Secret 
show. To be fair, this show alone is not the 
only reason Copps has called for the review 
of the standards.
After ABC broadcasted it last year, the 
commission launched an investigation into 
whether the show was appropriate in prime
time, when children would be likely to see 
it. The inquiry concluded that the lingerie 
show was acceptable.
Now, I certainly agree that some material 
is not appropriate for viewing on TV; there

vinced that the University is to blame for1 
student shortsightedness. There are just too  
many New Jersey residents who were1

When Warner Hall grants exclusive access' 
to the inner sanctum of knowledge, they 
explain their predicaments cryptically and 
apologetically. I think it reached a new level 
of absurdity with the anticipated nine mil- !

cent tuition increase. The University is.l

public displays of indecency can be out

mind that freedom of speech is an important 
principle, and if we are to err on either side, 
it should be on the side of freedom.
Additionally, viewers themselves should 
be trusted to decide, both collectively and 
individually, what to watch and not watch. 
Nothing beats the free market in determin

me to a broader point: Why does govern

Humbug 
to holiday 
killjoys
Christian Restifo
In the words of that most hip man, 
Andy Williams, its the most wonder
ful time of the year. Its been a pretty 
stressful year, and I for one am more 
than ready for some serious holiday 
activities. I had my lights up before 
Thanksgiving, and I keep my radio 
tuned to the local oldies station that 
now plays nothing but holiday music. 
I cant wait to get my Christmas tree 
set up and put some gifts under it.
Whether or not I have any fun is 
another matter altogether. Little did I 
know how dangerous the holiday sea
son could be to people, pets, and kids. 
Threats exist from trees and lights, 
food and alcohol, and even sex. And 
many do-gooders and news reporters 
have lined up to protect us. But I 
wont let this stop me. Damn the dan
gers; Im having fun.
Every year we have to learn about 
the latent threats of trees and decora
tions. Mistletoe is poisonous, tinsel 
can cause choking, and spray-on 
snow sends allergic kids into shock. 
(Well, maybe thats not so bad. I hate 
that fake snow stuff anyway.) Many 
people even claim we should all 
switch to fire-resistant plastic trees 
that are safer and kinder to Mother 
Earth. I dont know if a pine spray 
would be toxic or not, but Im sure 
someone would object.
Well, I aint budging. Im getting a 
real tree, one that I have to decorate 
with lights after my kids go to bed 
because all the needles will poke me 
and make me swear. Im getting a tree 
that leaves sap on my hands after I 
adjust it for the 50th time to get it just 
right. Im getting a tree that was 
chopped down by a profiteering capi
talist who knew Id spend money for a 
tree Im going to throw out in a few 
weeks.
We also have the obligatory warn
ings every year about over indulging 
in food and drink. Hey, guess what? 
Were supposed to overindulge. Its 
the holidays. It comes from that 
pagan tradition of having a big party 
in the dead of winter when life is 
rather dreary. How else would we 
keep doctors, fitness experts, and 
weight loss programs in business the 
rest of the year? Some people have 
taken this to the extreme, worrying 
excessively about the health of our 
pets. Dont give Fido too much food, 
they say. And most importantly, never 
give your pet alcohol. Of course, you 
shouldnt give your pet eggnog or 
glogg (a traditional Swedish bever
age). Thats for you to drink. Your pet 
is like that mooch who brings 
Budweiser to your party and then 
proceeds to down all your 1996 
Merlot. Dont give her a thing.
Speaking of eggnog, even that isnt 
safe anymore. Now when I say 
eggnog, I mean real eggnog. That 
store-bought stuff thats thicker than 
motor oil doesnt count. Sure, that 
stuff is good in a pinch, but a holiday 
expert accepts only the real thing. Its 
got to have sugar, nutmeg, and eggs, 
raw and numerous. And you cant for
get the brandy or whiskey. Someone 
somewhere, though, feels this is a 
bad thing. After all, one out of 20,000 
eggs has salmonella according to the 
FDA. Its too much of a risk to drink 
real eggnog, they say. Yeah, that .06 
percent chance of one or more eggs in 
a dozen having salmonella is a real 
risk. For the statistics geeks among 
you, thats a binomial distribution 
with .00005 as the likelihood of sucSee HUMBUG, page A12

an intention to commit a crime, but my research 
with economics and psychology professor George 
Loewenstein and Harvard Business School profes
sor Max Bazerman (Auditor Independence, 
Conflict of Interest, and the Unconscious 
Intrusion of Bias) suggests that intentional fraud 
is only the most extreme manifestation of a far 
more pervasive and pernicious problem. Auditors 
who are peddling services to their clients, be they 
consulting services or future audit services, have a 
conflict of interest. And people cannot disregard 
their own self-interest, even when they try hard to 
do so.
Indeed, research suggests that close affiliation 
with a partisan may be all it takes to bias judgment. And bias is frequently unconscious  the 
conclusions we want to reach influence the ques
tions we ask, the way we interpret information, 
and the scrutiny to which we subject evidence. For 
example, those with extreme political views 
choose to expose themselves selectively to the 
views of others with similar views. They also sub
ject arguments for and against their beliefs to very 
different standards of evidence. Although many 
believe that auditing is simply a problem of count
ing and arithmetic to which there is a clear correct 
answer, anyone who has done it knows that it is a 
difficult task, fraught with ambiguity. 
Interpretation of information is likely to be biased 
in self-serving ways, and as long as these biases 
remain unconscious, even threats of severe pun
ishments for fraud are unlikely to end the prob
lem.
For auditors, the victims of inaccurate or fraud
ulent financial statements are likely to seem dis
tant. Investors who believe inaccurate financial 
statements and who lose money as a result may 
lose millions collectively, but it may be just a few 
dollars per share.
And these investors are not likely to be on famil
iar terms with the auditor. In contrast, immediate 
negative consequences would follow an auditors 
disclosure of falsehoods in a clients reports to its 
shareholders. Auditors depend on sustained posi
tive relations with clients for additional business. 
Keeping a client account is important for keeping 
ones job.
Consultants are hired to help increase the client 
firms profitability. Auditors are supposed to mea
sure that profitability. Nevertheless, it has been 
common for one firm to do both. The SarbanesOxley bill enacted earlier this summer restricts the 
other services that auditors can offer their clients.
This is clearly a step in the right direction, but is 
also too modest to restore the reliability of public 
financial disclosures. Far more dramatic changes 
are urgently necessary if faith in auditors reports 
and confidence in the capital markets is to be 
restored.
What does research suggest about potential 
solutions to the problem of conflict of interest and 
lack of independence among auditors? 
Eliminating financial conflicts of interest are nec
essary but are not sufficient for restoring auditor 
independence. Since a great deal of unconscious 
bias arises from close affiliation, the personal ties 
and chummy relations between auditors and their 
clients represent a substantial part of the problem. 
One possible solution would be that firms select 
auditors for fixed five-year terms, during which 
time they cannot be fired and after which they 
cannot be immediately re-hired. In addition, there 
should be a clear requirement that auditors may 
not take a position with a firm that they audit for 
until a number of years have passed beyond the 
end of their work with that client.
Many may regard these changes as too dramat
ic. I strongly disagree. The very basis of our capital 
markets depends on the availability of reliable 
information. Without such information, people 
with money to invest will prefer to put it under 
their mattresses rather than entrust it to firms 
whose performance and potential are unverifiable. Restoring that confidence necessitates 
important changes. It is incumbent on us that we 
act now, while we have an opportunity to correct 
these problems.

Finals are this week and everyone is stressed out. With this unfortunate piece of 
knowledge in mind, we were wondering:
What do you do to relax during finals week?
Dear Santa,
With the holidays just around the corner and 
the spending season in full swing, I figured this 
was as good a time as any to drop you a line. You 
see, Santa, I realize that Christmas is a time for 
giving, but I have to admit I like the receiving part 
a little bit too. After all, I think Im entitled to it. 
Ive been a good boy this past year; I havent wan
tonly spent tax payer dollars subsidizing failing 
farms, attempted to embroil the US in a long and 
intractable conflict against a small, poor Mid-East 
country, and gone back on my promise to leave 
no child behind with a dismissal of school vouch
ers in my heavily larded education bill. (No, that 
was our president.) I think my list is a relatively 
modest one, and my requests are probably the 
same as a few fair-minded Americans as well. So 
this is what I really want for Christmas, Santa. Oh, 
and I wouldnt worry about your foreign status 
when delivering goodies to all the other boys and 
girls this year. Look at it this way. Even if the INS 
detains you, youve still got a better shot at getting 
a lawyer than some of our own citizens do.
Please bring me an end to our push for war in 
Iraq. Any conflict which will be as prohibitive in 
cost and human causalities as this one appears to 
be deserves a review of our priorities. Apparently, 
Paul Wolfowitz, Scooter Libby, and the rest of 
the civilians in President Bushs cabinet havent 
heard that bin Laden is still alive and our economy 
still on the ebb. Focus on cutting taxes and killing 
the man who helped mastermind a plot that 
brought down the Twin Towers in the city I love. 
Any invasion of Iraq at this point will do more 
harm in terms of destabilizing the populations of 
several anti-American Middle Eastern countries, 
especially Egypt and Jordan, than a sober and 
well-considered containment policy ever could. 
The nation-building sure to be involved in a post
regime change Iraq is sure to put American ser
vicemen  like my father and brother  at risk 
and theres nothing terrorists would like more 
than 50,000 or so targets in their backyard.
And while were on the subject of Iraq, Santa, 
can you please bring me a new rhetorical device 
for all the political pundits out there who still
Annalisa Schaefer/Art Staff
insist on the Hitlerization of this war? First of 
all, I hate Saddam Hussein. Hes an evil despot 
who gassed his own people during the war with 
Iran in 1988. He invaded Kuwait two years later 
and his Republican Guard cut a swath across that 
country that drew chilling comparisons to the 
Japanese Rape of Nanking. But hes not Adolf 
Hitler. And Iraqi soldiers arent Nazi blackshirts. 
However, from the New Republic to National 
Review, liberal to conservative, this facile compar
ison is constantly used as a trump card in every 
debate about the imminent threat Hussein and 
his impoverished country pose to the US. Its 
cheap and misleading.
Id like some way to narrow the camps between 
those relatives of mine who know of CMU and 
think its the best thing since sliced neutrons, and 
the rest whove never heard a thing about the 
school, dont know where the hell it is, and won
der why I chose to study history at a university 
whose most famous scholar in this area is Peter 
Stearns.
This next ones a favor. Please bring a copy of 
the US Constitution and a highlighter pen to the 
Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals apropos their 
ruling last Thursday on the Second Amendment. 
Evidently, the phrase the right of the people to 
keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed isnt 
clear enough.
I also want a new tax code. Now before you get 
all huffy about your sleigh buckling under the 
weight of a Marlon Brando-sized IRS rules book, 
hear me out. Instead of the byzantine and confis
catory system we already have in place  double 
dividends taxation and marriage penalty, anyone?
 how about something much easier to under
stand, and thus, abide by? Like, say, a flat tax or
consumption tax. Lets encourage economic 
growth by letting people spend their money how 
they see fit, not as the government tells them to. If 
the tax frameworks instituted in Russia and Chile 
are any indication, individual investment and 
spending do more than heavy-handed federal fiats 
like ours ever could. Remember Santa, the ugliest 
strip mall is far prettier than even the most beauti
ful gulag.
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Nuff said.
A muzzle for the globalization and climate 
change doomsayers. With human well-being at an 
all-time high thanks to the trade and investment 
of capitalism without borders, I cant see much to 
fret about. Protectionist policies and high tariffs 
can only hurt countries, and thanks to globaliza
tion, more and more individuals from indigent 
locations are pulling themselves out of poverty 
and into the free marketplace. The fears that 
accompany apocalyptic climate change scenarios 
are likewise unfounded. Look outside. The east
ern seaboard has been blanketed with snow and 
sleet. In Russia and Norway, temperatures are 
dropping like United Airlines stock to decade lows. 
If the progressives here and in Europe cant see 
this, thats their problem.
So I guess Im asking for some eyeglasses as 
well.
Lastly, Santa, Id like a moratorium on fake, 
smarmy letters to imaginary bearded octogenari
ans who live at an undisclosed bunker near the 
North Pole. I mean really, grow up.

cess. Do the math.
I have no intention of drinking 
safe virgin eggnog. It does nothing 
to get me all warm and fuzzy and in 
the holiday mood. Now that I men
tion it, even the holiday mood is dan
gerous.
A couple years back, some 
researchers in England found them
selves curious about sexual behavior 
during the holidays. They looked at 
the numbers of abortions in the first 
few months of the year and the num
ber of births around September and 
found an interesting correlation. 
Their conclusion? People get 
amorous this time of year and some
times give (or get) the gift that keeps 
on giving.
This tradition, of course, comes to 
us from many different cultures. Take 
Swedish people: After eating from a 
smorgasboard, putting some candles 
on their heads, and drinking some 
good glogg, Swedes have pretty much 
nothing else to do while stuck indoors 
with six feet of snow outside. Throw 
in a nice wood burning fire (gas is for 
losers), and youve got a combination 
better than Marvin Gaye and Barry 
White put together. (Vill du har kon 
denna kvall, baby?)
Of course, the smart people take 
precautions and can still enjoy them
selves. Getting married tends to take 
care of a lot of problems, though your 
spouse may have to beat back you and 
your advances with a stick from time 
to time. Obviously, one can use birth 
control. The next best method is to 
make sure that you never visit 
Sweden again and that your partner 
doesnt know which country you live 
in. Remember it helps to speak only 
Italian in Sweden when you actually 
live in Reno, NV.
People out there want to kill holi
day fun. Dont even give them a 
chance. Grab an axe, chop down a 
tree, decorate it with too many lights, 
eat and drink your fill, and get to 
know someone better this holiday 
season. You always have New Years 
resolutions to handle your regrets.

and maximize their viewership. 
Young men happen to be one of the 
target audiences that advertisers 
covet. Are we to blame CBS for 
doing what its supposed to?
As far as the charge that it is 
degrading to women, the models 
certainly dont seem to mind.

For CMU, unwise investing and 
inadequate alumni donations have 
hampered the endowments growth 
while other schools have succeeded. 
But Bill Elliott, the Universitys jackof-all-trades vice president and by 
all accounts a bright fellow, 
described the schools poverty as

Dont you just love that slant?

dollars in the dot-com bust, but bad

incompetent or uninterested in 
explaining where CMU went wrong 
and whats been done to correct it.

boost both demand and fees for the 
model. One can quickly rise from 
obscurity to become a household 
name almost overnight. Seems any
thing but degrading to me.
This brings me back to my initial 
point. When most men look at 
Fernanda Tavares or Allesandra

beauty. Supermodels are not looked

 just the opposite, they are

Color-blind admissions? In Utopia 
maybe, but certainly not going to 
happen here any time soon. Now 
CMU is investment-blind; the school 
provides complete autonomy to 
fund managers who decide what 
equity stakes to pound. The 
University doesnt even check the 
countries that it is invested in. 
Interdisciplinary relationships dont 
just have to be between different 
academic programs (what depart
ment has psychology asked to dance 
this week?). Collaboration between 
the administration and the colleges 
would be a wise interdisciplinary 
approach. Surely the formulas and 
advice of business leaders from the 
countrys third best b-school could 
do just as well as fat cat fund man
agers.
But there is really no reason for 
Warner Hall to openly explain the 
failures of its investing, dining, or 
any policy, for that matter. No sense 
in drawing attention to yourself and 
your deficiencies. The status quo at 
this fine technical school is fine for 
the linchpins and moneymakers. So 
who is going to rock the boat?

shot as her shot-clock expired, but CMU was forced 
to begin fouling, with only a three-second differ
ence between the shot-clock and game clock. 
Rochester hit only three of its final five free throw 
attempts, and Sodini was able to hit a layup, but 
Rochesters domination of the boards kept the ball 
in their possession. In total Rochester gathered 50 
rebounds to the Tartans 29, with the entire margin 
occurring when Rochester was on offense, 30-9.
It was, however, a Tartan team rebound after the 
Yellowjackets final free throw attempt that gave 
the Tartans their final chance to win. With only one 
second remaining, they had possession down 
49-48, but Sodinis half-court shot fell short by sev
eral feet as time expired to give Rochester the vic
tory.
Earlier, on Tuesday, the women faced John 
Carroll University (Ohio) (2-2). The Tartans never 
trailed, while the only tie was at 0-0. Carroll did 
give Carnegie Mellon some scares, chiefly early in 
the second half.
The game started with an 8-2 Tartan run. While 
their lead was quickly reduced to only two points, 
the team rode 11 first-half steals, including five 
from junior forward Danyelle Sinclair and four 
from senior guard Danielle Bennett, to keep the 
Blue Streaks at arms length throughout the half. 
The Tartans led by as many as 10 points, but 
allowed Carroll to move to within four at halftime, 
30-26.
The second half mirrored the first, with Carnegie 
Mellon starting out on another long 12-3 run, 
which included the games first three-pointer. Once 
again, the Blue Streaks climbed back from their 13- 
point deficit and cut the Tartan lead to three points 
on their own 15-5 run.
As Carroll approached a tie, Sodini and Sinclair 
started their defensive tactic again, and the Tartans 
took four more steals over the next four minutes, 
yielding 11 Tartan points and giving them a secure 
lead.
Free throws down the stretch by each of Carnegie 
Mellons starters kept their score out of reach for 
the Streaks, and the game ended 69-58 on a 
Sinclair layup.

NFL, from page A14
Redskins make me look like a fool.
I clearly shouldve picked your 
Falcons to steal the final wildcard 
in the NFC (I do now), and thank 
you for going unbeaten since 
October to drive that point home.
Dear Mike Martz,
Thank you for coaching your 
team out of a playoff berth. I, as a 
proud 49ers fan, cant stand your 
miserable excuse for a team, and it 
will truly make my holiday season 
to know you are spending January 
wondering what happened. Here 
is a little insight: HAND THE BALL 
TO MARSHALL. Well see you next 
year, and I hope the fairways treat 
you better than the football field.
Dear Kurt Warner and Mark 
Bulger,
Thank you for proving my con
tention that Kurt Warner sucks, 
and did not deserve any of the 
MVP awards he got. Kurt, your 
0-6 season was perfect. Your lame 
attempt to tough out an injury, 
when you shouldve helped your 
team by riding the pine for awhile, 
proves your inadequacy. Thank 
you Mark, for showing the world 
that anybody can run the Rams 
offense.
Dear Drew Bledsoe,
Thank you for proving to the 
world you are still an amazing 
quarterback, and it was you (not 
Tom Brady) who shouldve stayed 
in New England. Yes, Brady is 
doing well, but Bledsoe is doing it 
on the Bills. As a Pats supporter I 
am one of few who feels Bledsoe 
deserved his spot back last year, 
and am very happy to see him 
doing good things for the Bills. My 
only regret is that he was traded to 
a division rival, and I had hoped 
he would end up in Chicago so the 
Bears could destroy the hated 
Packers and take the division.
Dear Warren Sapp,
Thank you for reminding us that 
football is a physical sport. If peo
ple dont have their heads up then 
they deserve to get rocked. When 
a player gets blindsided in hockey 
he gets up, skates away, and learns 
his lesson. In football teams start 
crying when people take a knock 
or two. Thank you to Warren, and 
all the other defensive players who 
remind us that this is not a game 
for the faint of heart.
Okay guys, Im done for the 
semester. I pick the 49ers, Bucs, 
Packers, Eagles, Saints, and 
Falcons to go in the NFC, and the 
resurgent Colts, Fins, Chargers, 
Steelers, Broncos, and Pats/Bills to 
represent the AFC. Good luck with 
finals, have a good break, and go 
Notre Dame.

Tartans came out and played a ten

dominate the boards and take a big 
first-half lead, springing them to a

was that the Tartans were not creat

percent overall. Rochester shot 52 
percent for the game.
The Tartans trailed 29-15 at half 
time and at one point found them
selves trailing by over 20 points, as 
the starters could not make any of 
their shots. The second team came 
in with about 15 minutes left in the 
half and added a big boost. Led by 
some big three-point shots by firstyear AJ Straub and first-year Mickey 
Goetz, the team slowly fought its 
way back into the game, and 
brought energy and aggressiveness
into the team. With two minutes 
left, the team was only down seven 
points. However, the comeback was 
too little, too late, as Rochester hit 
all of their free throws down the 
stretch.
Rochester got a big game out of 
starting guard Tim Sweeney, who 
shot 5-9 from the field and hit three 
out of five three-pointers, totaling 
17 points. Center Seth Hauben 
added 7 points and 17 rebounds for 
Rochester, who had 44 rebounds 
overall and 11 on the offensive end. 
Michael Divens was the only Tartan 
player to score in double digits, 
totaling 14 points.
I was very disappointed with the 
game, said Wingen. We needed to 
come out and dictate the pace of the 
game against a team like Rochester, 
but instead we played tentatively 
and allowed them to play their half
court game. We are still a young, 
immature team, and I think 
Rochesters experience and maturi
ty allowed them to cope better with 
a big game. We let an opportunity 
slip away.

At Grove 
City, CMU 
men win 
Invitational
by Bcicjt Pcgsdefkcg
Contributing Editor
The Carnegie Mellon mens and 
womens swim teams closed out 
the first half of their season with a 
flourish this weekend, as both 
teams captured victories in the 
Longnecker Invitational hosted by 
Grove City College. The victory by 
the mens team marked their sec
ond consecutive win at the 
Invitational.
The Tartans also sent six repre
sentatives to the Miami
Invitational, held at Miami 
University of Ohio. While they were 
unable to make much of an impact 
on the scoresheet, those that went 
had the experience of competing 
with Division I swimming talent. 
One of the notable performers was 
sophomore Allison Theus, the lone 
female representative. Theus was 
unable to score in any of her events, 
but set personal bests in both the 
200 individual medley (IM) and 
the 200 fly.
While there was a definite lack of 
Tartan presence at the Miami meet, 
it was not by chance. Head coach 
David Belowich gave his swimmers 
the option of which meet to attend, 
and some opted out in order to pre
pare for their upcoming finals.
I was very supportive of that 
decision, said Belowich. After all, 
they are first and foremost stu
dents.
Those that chose to go to Grove 
City saw a different outcome, as 
they were able to come away with 
decisive victories. In addition, the 
womens team, which was only 
able to take seventh place at last 
years meet, improved dramatical
ly. Part of the sudden rise had to do 
with the extra swimmers that made 
the trip this year.
We had a lot more women go to 
Miami last year, said Belowich. 
So naturally, the women did a lot 
better.
One of the top performers for the 
Tartan women was sophomore 
Emily Evans, who recorded new 
personal bests in the 100 back
stroke (1:02.36) and the 200 back
stroke (2:15.11). Her time in the 
100 was also a new meet record.
The real strength of the women, 
though, was in how dominant they 
were as a team. Of the 17 that 
attended the meet, only one failed 
to score in an event.
It was just a good, solid perfor
mance by all of the girls, said 
Belowich. That's indicative of the 
kind of team they are.
The divers got in on the action as 
well, as first-year Julie Pavia and 
sophomore Mindi Finnegan fin
ished first and second in the 1- 
meter dive. Both also notched Acuts in the process. Junior Sean 
Battis also had a strong meet, fin
ishing a close second in the 3-meter 
dive.
The mens team continued their 
usual dominance, as they finished 
ahead of the second place 
Wolverines by almost 300 points. 
Leading the charge was sophomore 
Chris Pearson, who continues to 
add to his impressive collection of 
records. Pearson earned A-cuts in 
the 1650 freestyle (15:52.81), and 
B-cuts in the 200 IM (1:54.65) and 
400 IM (4:08.60).
With this performance, Pearson 
has collected eight A-cuts this sea
son, and several of them were in 
what might have been off-events 
for him previously.
Chris started as pretty much a 
freestyler, said Belowich, but hes 
become much more versatile.
Pearson wasnt the only Tartan 
having a good day. Sophomore 
teammates Luis Vega and Bobby 
Colyer also had strong perfor
mances, even though they were not 
prominent on the scoresheet.
Colyer recorded personal bests in 
the 200 breaststroke (2:08.88), 
200 IM (1:58.42), and 400 IM 
(4:16.51). In addition, his finish in 
the 200 breaststroke was good for a 
B-cut.
Vega, while not breaking any 
records, broke his career times in 
the 200 backstroke (2:04.38), and 
had a very solid meet overall.
The statistics wont tell you the 
whole story, said Belowich. Luis 
had a fine meet, especially in the 
backstroke and sprints.
Having closed out the first half of 
the season in impressive fashion, 
the Tartans will now take a needed 
break, before getting back to train
ing and competing in January.
Doling out 
the holiday 
gratitude
nJegr MJeeJlow
The holiday season is rapidly 
approaching, which means one 
thing: presents. Thats right kids, its 
time for Santa Claus to make his 
annual run across the world and 
deliver boatloads of gifts to each and 
every one of us.
Well, not really, but ideally that 
would be the case. You know the 
best thing about believing in Santa? 
You never had to write more than 
one thank you card; everything came 
from him. Now you spend two or 
three days writing notes to parents, 
stepparents, grandparents, and even 
godparents for all the things they 
throw at you during the Christmas 
season.
As much as it sucks to write these 
things, it is something that you cant 
justify not doing. When someone 
gives you a gift it is your obligation 
to send a thank you card. Plus, Ive 
learned that the more years you send 
them cards the better gifts you get. 
They are like reward points, or fre
quent flyer miles; the more cheesy 
little notes of appreciation you send 
the more they will spend on you the 
following year. So, with that said, I 
feel it is my duty as a football colum
nist to thank all those who gave me 
material to write about. Ive written 
each a little card:
Dear Tommy Maddox and Ricky 
Williams,
Thank you for being the two play
ers who I said would do well and 
actually did. Without career years 
from each of you Id look like more of 
a fool than I already do. Tommy, 
please fully recover from your brush 
with being crippled to lead the 
Steelers to the playoffs, and Ricky, if 
you could lead your team to the 
Super Bowl and complete half of my 
prediction I would really appreciate it.
Dear Steve Spurrier and the 
Washington Redskins,
Thank you for making me look like 
a jackass. I must finally acknowledge 
the harping of my Policy teacher, my 
roommate, and everyone else who 
reads this column, and admit that I 
was very wrong about you. Thank 
you for never giving your QBs a fair 
chance, thank you for wasting per
haps the most talented defense in 
the NFL, thank you for not using 
Stephen Davis enough. Thanks for all 
these things, and so many other poor 
coaching and playing performances 
this season. Youve made me look 
stupid for believing you could do it.
Dear Michael Vick,
Thank you for helping the

Tartan forward Ross Freeman shoots over his defender on Saturday.

Contributing Editor
The Tartans hung in with two of 
the toughest opponents on their 
schedule this past week, but in the 
end came up painfully short. They 
took a giant step forward by traveling 
to Division I Robert Morris University 
on Wednesday and almost pulling off 
a monumental upset, but then took a 
disappointing step backwards in 
playing a sloppy game against the 
second-ranked University of 
Rochester Yellowjackets at Skibo 
Gymnasium Saturday afternoon in a 
66-50 loss.
Although the Tartans lost 68-55 to 
Robert Morris, they led with 15:18 
left in the second half and were only 
down five points with 5:12 left in the 
game. But Robert Morris pressed 
their huge size advantage and 21 
Carnegie Mellon turnovers to pull 
away from the Tartans late. The 
Colonials, who can offer athletic 
scholarships because of their D-I sta
tus, had only one player under six 
feet, and by going inside, shot .500 in 
the second half and scored 24 points 
in the paint for the game.
Its a confidence builder to hang in 
with a Division I team like we did, 
said head coach Tony Wingen after 
the game. Im very proud of the 
team, we played a very good aggres
sive game. This game also shows us 
that we have to hang onto the basket
ball.
Making the effort even more 
impressive, the Tartans competed 
with the Colonials without leading 
scorer Matt Kaitz, who was out with a 
sprained MCL from the previous 
game, and Nick Miller, who sliced his 
right index finger doing an engineer
ing project and needed ten stitches. 
Kaitz returned the next game, but 
Miller will be out until at least after 
Christmas. In their absence, the 
Tartans got a big game out of Michael 
Divens, who added a double-double 
with 18 points and 10 rebounds in his 
first college start. Eliot Goren added 
15 points while shooting 3-for-5 from 
the three-point line.
Right from the tip we had the 
mindset of Why cant we beat them? 
Why not us?  said Divens. Our 
defense kept us in the game. Weve 
been pretty quick and working hard 
all year.
The Robert Morris players were 
disappointed with their effort against 
the Tartans, as they saw the Tartans 
start to a quick 12-4 lead and had to 
fight them off  a Division III team 
 all game. The mood in the locker 
room after the game was that of a 
loss, said Colonial forward Aaron 
Thomas, who had 13 points and 8 
rebounds. Maybe we overlooked our 
opponent, and it wakes us up in a lot 
of aspects.
Unfortunately, the Tartans could

Tartan women 
lose game of 
catch-up to UR
Carnegie Mellon loses, 49-48, in a 
close back-and-forth game that 
included a failed last-minute surge
by Adam Greenberg
Staffwriter
For the womens basketball team, their UAA 
opener against Rochester was a game of 
streaks. The Tartans (4-2, 0-1 in the UAA) 
hosted the nationally-ranked Yellowjackets 
(5-0, 1-0) Saturday afternoon. As Rochester 
opened the game on an 11-2 run, it became 
apparent that CMU would be playing catch-up 
ball for a while.
While Carnegie Mellon opened the after
noons scoring, the women allowed Rochester 
to build their lead with nine consecutive 
missed shots. When senior guard Michelle 
Sodini broke the Tartans scoreless run with a 
layup with 13 minutes to play, Rochesters 
offense froze. They watched as the Tartans dis
mantled their nine-point lead and over the 
next five minutes and took a 16-15 lead thanks 
to steals by Sodini and junior forward Carissa 
Sain.
Surprised by the Tartans sudden burst of 
offense, the Yellowjackets mounted another 
streak of their own; the Tartans furthered the 
Rochester run by not scoring in the subsequent 
five minutes, and Rochester led 28-20 at halftime.
While the first half was characterized by 
long periods of dominance by one of the teams, 
in the second, the teams started to follow each 
other more closely. Carnegie Mellon used 
steals, a slight rebound advantage, and five

time since 2-2. It was the first of four consecu
tive ties.
The game slowed tremendously as it 
approached the end. After exchanging baskets,

endgame, eventually pushing their lead to four

The youngest guardian
Ryan Necas one of only eight members of ancient martial arts order
Ryan Necas is anything but a typical first-year stu
dent. Upon meeting him, Necas seems simply a mildmannered computer science student. At his home in 
northern Pennsylvania he spends much of his time 
meditating and enjoying the outdoors. Passing him 
here on campus, you would never guess that such an 
even-tempered individual knows at least four ways to 
fatally injure someone with nothing but his right 
index finger.
Many may remember Necas from the talent show 
during orientation (or perhaps from the homecoming 
football game, for which he painted himself red from 
the waist up), but few know the extent to which hes 
been trained in martial arts. No, hes not just some 
black belt in tae kwan do, or particularly adept at jujit
su. Hes part of a 4,500-year-old order of martial 
artists who have been rigorously trained to reach the 
highest levels of physical, mental, and spiritual 
strength possible. At any given time there are no more 
than eight living members in the world, and Necas 
was chosen to be their current leader.
Translated into English, the name of this group is 
the Order of the Guardians. Necas was chosen, along 
with seven other artists, from a pool of over 1,700 
applicants from around the globe. The final living 
member of the last Order of the Guardians, Master 
Zhang, was 95 at the time, and therefore decided it 
was time to train a new order. He sent out invitations 
to hundreds of martial artists between the ages of 12 
and 18, and had them all go to Penn State to interview 
and audition for the coveted eight spaces.
After finding out what type of training and tech
niques each artist used, and then testing their mental, 
physical, and spiritual strength, over 1,000 of the con
tenders were eliminated, and the rest stayed to partic
ipate in a tournament. Following six days of round the 
clock fighting, the final eight artists emerged. Seven 
of them were between the ages of 16 and 18. Necas 
was only 12.
The artists spent the next three months training 
with 40 different teachers for 16 to 20 hours a day. If 
they trained hard, they were allowed to sleep in the 
shelters they built themselves outside. If not, Master 
Zhang would break glass bottles against their backs 
with a baseball bat. Sound rough? That didnt even 
begin to compare to their actual instruction. Necas 
recalls the first task he was asked to perform. See this 
scar? he asked, pointing to a small mark on his left 
hand where his thumb meets his index finger. He put 
a nail here and [gestures to having it hammered into 
the table through his hand]. It went through to the 
table a little bit. The thing is: we had to take the nail 
out ourselves, and we couldnt cry or make a sound or 
anything.
Aside from Necass knowledge of martial arts, the 
spiritual training he underwent is fascinating. 
Through meditation he has learned to alter his heart 
rate, change the outflow of chemicals from his body 
(specifically testosterone, adrenalin, and endor
phins), and vary his metabolism without moving.
Megan Robinson/Staffwriter
Ryan Necas demonstrates the begining motion for 
two different moves he has learned.
These mental techniques are all useful in his fight
ing. According to Necas, when he gets into fight 
mode, his mind is completely clear. His training allows 
him to put himself into a state of pure consciousness 
when being attacked, so the moves come completely 
naturally to him.
This is not to say that one should get nervous at the 
sight of Necas walking across the cut. One cannot help 
but be struck by the gentleness of his personality.
The greatest warriors are measured by the 
strength of their hearts, not their muscles. Violence is 
not the way. Peace and love are true power, he states.
When talk comes to the details of when the 
Guardians of the Order use their skills, and who they 
use them against, Necass normally eloquent manner 
of speaking begins to slow. He reveals that they neu
tralize threats, but other than that statement he pre
ferred to stray from the topic. Necas was more than 
happy, however, to demonstrate some of his tech
niques on his future roommate, CIT first-year Sunny 
Singh.

Eight students in the Rhodesian program, a privately-funded program 
designed to train civil servants, were expelled from the University after 
boycotting classes for a month. The students claimed that CMU and 
companies funding the program were plotting to put pro-Western pup
pets in power in Rhodesia. The programs dean, Otto Davis, and presi
dent Richard Cyert refuted their claim. According to the students, CMU 
was obligated to keep them in America because returning home could be 
dangerous, even fatal. Davis said that CMU was under this obligation 
only as long as the students remained in the program and that immigra
tion officials would be notified that these students were no longer 
enrolled.

Gingerbread and sugar cookies
Who needs love, sweet love when you can have holiday cookies?
A thin mint, an Oreo, an Eat n Park smiley  no matter your 
favorite, youd probably agree that a cookie is a treat any day of the 
year. But Santa Claus will readily attest that during the holiday sea
son, cookies take on a special significance. Koekjes  little cakes, in 
Dutch  first traveled to the United States in the 16th century, from 
England, Scotland, and Holland. Homesick immigrants cherished 
the small confections, and used them as sweet links between their 
motherland and their new homes. Especially around Christmastime, 
they enjoyed baking cookies in large batches, gathering around the 
Yule log with family and friends to share the traditional delicacy and 
fond memories of home.
Today, this tasty domestic ritual lives on in the form of the holiday 
cookie exchange. From the vogue office party crowd to the church 
crafters guild, people across the nation are holding cookie exchanges 
as a forum for sharing both sweets and seasonal cheer. Partygoers 
arrive with a generous batch of their favorite cookie, often with 
recipe cards to give away, and indulge in each others sugary gifts. 
Not only does this tradition spread delicious holiday spirit, but it also 
offers a glimpse into diverse backgrounds and customs; and for 
almost every distinct culture, there is a unique holiday cookie to 
match.
Perhaps one of the most recognizable and widely cherished 
Christmas cookies is gingerbread. Boldly flavored with 
cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, these favorites 
entered the holiday scene in medieval times;
European crusaders brought gingerbread back 
from the Middle East, delighting their families 
with the intense, exotic flavors. Catholic monks 
were the first to form the gingerbread into 
shapes, and the cookie cutter tradition lives on 
today, with gingerbread men, women, chil
dren, and all manner of animals.
Scottish bakers bring short
bread to the Christmas and 
New Years tables. They typi
cally cut the cookie into wedges 
or rounds, and notch the edges to sig
nify the persistence of the suns rays 
throughout the cold winter months. This 
recipe owes its timelessness to its simplici
ty; butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt melt into 
a pure, pristine flavor that nicely 
compliments some of the heartier 
holiday foods.
On December 6, German children celebrate St. Nicholas Day by 
placing their shoes on the doorstep for the jolly holiday patron to fill 
with stocking-stuffer goodies. A common addition to the gift package 
is Lebkuchen, a honey-based cookie that is pressed in a special mold. 
Though German bakers are bombarded with December requests for 
the confection, these chewy cookies only improve with a bit of age; 
after resting a few weeks in the pantry, their spices marry and create 
perfect holiday warmth.
The classic American holiday cookie, however, is the sweetly sim
ple sugar cookie. With this recipewhich yields about 70 cookies  
youll have plenty to share and spread the holiday cheer. Remember, 
everybody loves the gift of food.
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour 
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 cup white sugar 
1 cup butter 
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons cream 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Preheat your oven to 400F. Meanwhile, into a large bowl, sift 
together your flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Using a forkor 
a pastry blender if you have one  mash in the butter until the dough 
resembles cornmeal. Next, stir in the egg, cream, and vanilla, and 
blend them well. At this point, you can freeze 
the dough for later use, or move onto the 
fun part: On a lightly floured surface, 
roll out the dough until its about 1/8 of 
an inch thick. Sprinkle it lightly with 
sugar  white or colored  and bring 
out the cookie cutters. Dont forget to 
use a drinking straw to punch a hole in 
each cookie, so that later youll be 
able to string a ribbon 
through your cookie and 
make a sweet ornament. 
Place the cut cookies on 
an ungreased baking 
sheet, and bake for six to 
eight minutes, until the cookies are 
lightly set and just barely golden 
brown.

The lamb of La Strada
New Cultural District restaurant delivers utmost in class
In a controversy, the instant we feel anger we have already 
ceased striving for the truth, and have begun striving for ourselves.
This helpful little aphorism comes to us by way of Buddha, and 
the participants in the recent La Strada flap would do well to take 
heed of the religious icons advice. For the uninitiated, the story 
goes thus: Kevin Langholz, real estate executive and president of 
Langholz/Wilson & Associates, assembled 15 of his favorite deeppocketed friends on the night of October 5 in order to dine at the 
swanky new La Strada restaurant adjacent to the Langholz/Wilson 
offices. The plan was to eat and then spirit the 16-member 
entourage away to the Jerry Seinfeld stand-up show at Heinz Hall. 
But a funny thing happened on the way to this forum. It seems that 
Langholz and company were unhappy with the food (blackened 
pasta and still-flapping sea bass) and the service (30 minutes for 
appetizers, two hours for entrees) and wanted a pass on the 
$1,151.03 total. After several dithery minutes, the group left the 
restaurant, as well as a $200 hundred dollar tip for their waitress, 
while Langholz himself offered up his business card with the prom
ise to settle matters at a later date.
Fast forward to November 4, when our embattled executive 
found himself sitting in an Allegheny County jail for 13 hours, only 
to have Wilson  apparently the deus ex machina in this sordid 
tragedy  make his $1,000 bail. The snowball started tumbling for 
Langholz, when, on October 11, a police officer, at the behest of La 
Strada management, paid a visit to the next-door office and 
informed the real estate executive that the bill was to be paid by 
October 14 or a warrant would be issued for his arrest. By 
November 1, bill still unpaid, the long arm of the law intervened. 
Though four uniformed cops found the Langholz/Wilson offices 
minus Langholz, he turned himself in the following Monday, 
November 4. For his theft of services charge, the businessman 
stewed in the pokey for half a day and La Strada, having got its man, 
suffered in the court of public opinion, where bad word-of-mouth
 especially among its Gatsby-esque target clientele  is far more 
deleterious than even the most excessive of attorneys fees. So 
whos in the wrong here? Well, both are. The truth we strive for in 
controversial matters like these is probably lost; stuck to the bottom 
of a La Strada stock pot or discarded with a cache of unread office 
faxes.
So for those of you who may have been turned off by this uncivil 
melodrama, know this: the longer you stay away, the longer you go 
without a dining experience like that found only at La Strada. The 
restaurant (or is it ristorante in this case?) boasts an environment 
well-suited to Pittsburghs tony Cultural District. Beautiful, art deco 
interiors are swarming with a collection of proper-looking tables 
and comfortable chairs. The two-tier dining space is dog-legged
around kitchen and restroom areas, all with a modern, multi-mil
lion dollar flair. The whole restaurant is enclosed with enormous 
red curtains, befitting the classy and operatic atmosphere. The wait 
staff is clad in red and black, and seem to move with the elegance 
and confidence of a klatch of well-seasoned matadors. A sprawling 
bar is buffeted with three televisions (sports and financial news, if 
youre curious) and boasts an admirable number of pricey liquors. 
A tiny candle on each table compliments the overall mood and 
serves as the perfect topper; this is a place for dates and occasions 
with those you love.
But lets not ignore the shoe for the shine. At La Strada, the cui
sine aims to be as elegant as its surroundings. To this end, the 
restaurants executive chef, a Pittsburgher by way of New York and 
Naples, does his best to dress up the Northern and Southern Italian 
food into several inspiring presentations. Apparently this Italianborn chefs deracination hasnt affected his skill, since the food 
tastes as good as it looks. The complimentary bread and bruschett 
are excellent, but the focaccia is a tad dry. Starters are arranged by 
antipasto (hot and cold), soups, and salads. The gusty winter storm 
battering La Stradas immense windows/walls was enough to send 
this reviewer scouring the menu for a good minestra. The result was 
one of the soups of the day, a chunky and robust bean and bacon 
soup. From La Stradas extensive wine list (not to mention some 
helpful advice from the sommelier) this reviewer was able to pick a 
gem: a 2001 GlenLyon Vineyards Syrah. This winery is owned by 
the parents of a former Tartan and is an excellent choice as a bal
anced, semi-spicy red. Entrees include pasta, meat, and fish. A six 
course, two-person tasting menu is also available for those looking 
to sample a nice cross-section of dishes.
The La Strada lamb, this reviewers choice, came with a delicate 
presentation, complete with flower and Merlot demiglace. The 
three shanks were extremely tasty, but the garlic mashed potatoes 
accompanying them almost appeared like an obviation for a lumpy 
polenta which would have made an excellent partner. Lastly, 
dessert came as the delicately polite staff removed the remaining 
dishes, shanks, and bread baskets. The coffee selection is typical, 
heady espressos and sweet-sipping cappuccinos, along with a cou
ple of American counterparts. The house tiramisu, prepared with 
lemoncello, a frigidly-served Italian liqueur, was unavailable, so 
cheesecake had to take its place. Italian cheesecake is a bit moister 
than its American cousin because it is prepared with ricotta instead 
of cream cheese. A slight dusting of powdered sugar finished the 
dish and made for a rich end to an evening with Pittsburghs wealth
ier city-goers. Perhaps the very rich are different from you and I, as 
F. Scott Fitzgerald contended, but they like to eat just the same.

Metal for the holidays
Perfect gifts for the metaihead in your life
It is the end of another semester 
and calendar year, and of course we 
have a lot to look back on and for
ward to. Here are some of the high
lights.
Top five albums:
5.) Cathedral, The Vllth Coming
Lee Dorian and the boys put out 
another Sabbath-esque classic this 
year. Many thanks!
4.) Halford, Crucible
This album required multiple lis
tens to get it. But, now I do. Much 
different than the aptly titled 
Resurrection, but in my opinion 
another bold step for the man 
behind the Voice.
3.) Meshuggah, Nothing
In my review last semester, I 
seemingly passed this off as noth
ing new for the masters of the 
clangy riff. This may not have been 
fair or complete. Meshuggah is the 
new breed. It is hard to suppress 
the enormous anticipation and 
expectation for new work from this 
band, and given their previous 
work, it is hard to judge new work 
independently. Regardless, Nothing 
stands as a beacon for all metal 
musicians.
2.) Killswitch Engage, Alive or Just 
Breathing
As a rule, I try to ignore bands 
that attempt to alternate between 
sweet and gravelly vocals. 
Killswitch Engage are an exception. 
With vocals that could make a tat
tooed bulldog cry, this band made 
me stand up and listen. At times 
brutal and precise, and others mel
low and vulnerable, K.E. have the 
rare talent to mix light and deep, 
dark shade.
1.) Hatebreed, Persevere
Straightforward, for-the-jugular 
metal-core. Thats it. No gimmicks, 
no costumes. Nothing but music 
built around positive, self-esteem 
building lyrics. With Persever
ance, Hatebreed stands up for 
themselves and their fans.
More gifts for the music fan in your house....
Overkill, Wrecking Everything Live 
DVD/CD (Spitfire)
First The Lord of The Rings special 
edition and now this! Filmed on the 
occasion of their homecoming, 
these Jersey boys play all my old 
favorites, and maybe some of yours 
too. What else is there to say, its 
Overkill with a (fancy word alert) 
plethora of special features on a 2 
DVD set. Also available on CD.
Iron Maiden, Edward the Great 
(Sanctuary/Columbia)
What else to give the metal fan in 
your house than a collection of all 
the Maiden songs he already owns 
three times over? Well, if youre 
anything like my slightly obsessed 
friends, this collection. While offer
ing nothing really new, Edward the 
Great does have really cool packag
ing, and of course songs represent
ing each of the albums you have on 
the soundtrack to your life. And if
y y PfiSfVfRAftiCE
you havent heard of Iron Maiden, 
go get yourself this album right now 
and tell the clerk how Bruce 
Dickinson saved metal back in the 
80s.
Now, if you do have this, or are 
looking for something new, check 
out the awesome collection Eddies 
Archives, which promises no over
lap with the box set you already 
own two copies of  and it comes 
in a special collectors box with live 
and rare tracks. Anyone wanna slip 
one in my mailbox ?
ShOWS:
December 14 at Metropol 
Stone Sour
Interesting side project from the 
guys in Slipknot. The buzz before 
this album came out was that this 
would be a softer, mellower side of 
the clown (s). But, after checking it 
out, I gotta say that the songs 
remain (somewhat) the same. With 
exception to the hit single this 
album produced (Bother), the 
album still rocks heavily. The vocals 
arent as piercing as Slipknot, and 
there is more melody. But, if you
like Slipknot, this is a pleasant 
diversion until the new Slipknot 
comes out.

If you dont know why you should 
go, start re-reading from the begin

T6T6PKiss of the Spider Woman
Kiss of the Spiderwoman
December 10-14, 
January 15-18 
8 pm & 2 pm 
Purnell Center for the Arts 
Wells Studio
Romantic Molina, a gentle, gay window dresser, is about to finish his term in a 
Latin American prison (for doing you-know-what with a male minor). His new 
cellmate, Valentin, a gruff political prisoner, is hiding names that would lead the 
Warden to the core of the revolutionary movement. To help Valentin survive tor
ture, Molina tells him movies, and envelops him in a rich fantasy life built 
around Molinas favorite movie star, the glamorous Aurora. And glamorous she is, 
with a spangled dress and a song and dance for every occasion.
Costume coordinator  different from a costume designer because he could 
not make any pieces from scratch  Aaron Mastin (drama masters student) has 
dug up the most delightfully Key West outfit for Molina as well; his linen clam dig
gers, tight, patterned button-down shirt and signature scarves make him look 
ready to spread out on the prison floor as if it were the seashore. Valentin wears 
olive drab fatigues, but instead of a Che Guevara-style iconoclast, he looks like a 
forlorn sheep, a soldier who has lost his regiment.
Masters student Bryan Millers electronic lighting makes the stage and walls 
blush with heady patterns, fruity shapes, bold stripes and white-hot spotlights. 
The set, determined by the Wells Studios built-in balcony and chain link cage, 
seems to float in the blackness, as if strung on a spiders web. Drama faculty 
Geoffrey Hitchs knowing direction focused on the taut relationships and raw 
emotion of the play, but dance lecturer Judy Contes smooth choreography and 
drama faculty member Gerry Dantrys apt handling of the shows delicious songs 
make this a musical in earnest.

Latin American prisoners, glamorous movie stars, flawless performance
For a tropical escape, dont fly south for the winter  the School of Dramas 
Kiss of the Spider Woman is closer, cheaper, and full of glamorous Latin percussion 
to beat your winter blues! But behind the plush melodies and sultry dance num
bers beats a ravenous, bleeding heart; this show has bite  literally.
For a talented cast, one could not ask for better than this years drama seniors. 
The night I saw the show, Will Taylors Molina was thoughtful, fussy, and always 
dog-faithful. As Valentin, Rory OMalley created a paper-thin tough-guy faade 
with visible veins. And Katy Mixons charismatic, creepy Spider Woman filled the 
room with palpable shudders. But show-stealing performances were delivered by 
the underclassmen as well. As Molinas mother, Megan Hilty (Drama junior), 
brought me to tears with her flawlessly delivered song, You Could Never Shame 
Me (I get misty just thinking about it). Actually, there are almost as many sensu
al ballads and heart-rending tearjerkers in this show as there are upbeat, shim
mering Latin numbers. Its a great show, with a great cast  missing it would be 
the kiss of death.

Harry Potter hysteria
Magic for the masses
There isnt a school-age child who has
nt heard of J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter 
series of books. These works have inspired 
everything from two feature films to 
Quidditch sports bags, to vomit-flavored 
jellybeans. Many 
think it is nothing 
more than a harm
less piece of fic
tion, and a particu
larly good one at 
that. Others, how
ever, feel it should
be banned from bookstores and libraries, 
because of concepts some parents find 
inappropriate.
First-year computer science major 
Gwendolyn Stockman counts herself 
among Harry Potters fans. She says, I 
think its the way it touches our imagina
tions. Harry Potter is the quintessential 
underdog, except that hes famous. 
However, none of that matters to him. To 
others, different things about the works 
stand out. First-year Stacie Wax, an archi
tecture major, says, lI think its the writing 
itself. Its just so amazingly descriptive,
"I really wanted to go 
see the next Quidditch 
match."
 Stacie Wax, 
architecture first-year
you can imagine it taking place right in 
front of you. After reading a particular 
passage I felt I really wanted to go see the 
next Quidditch match.
To date, the four books have sold about 
140 million copies worldwide in 47 lan
guages, and while the first movie grossed 
$300 million total at the box office, the 
second movie has already made a whop
ping $200,159,012.
"Harry Potter is the devil and 
he is destroying people."
 a New Mexico pastor
J.K. Rowlings 
fan base continues 
to grow  and 
many wonder 
where the fifth 
Harry Potter book 
is. Originally slated 
for early this past 
summer, the release date kept getting 
pushed back, until finally they have decid
ed not to say anything more. The fans are 
anxious for it, I can tell you that, says 
Leah Lewandowski, manager of Hobbit 
Hall, a childrens bookstore in Roswell. 
And its funny, its the parents who are 
asking more than the kids.
With every action there is an equal and 
opposite reaction, and thus there are 
those who hate and despise Harry Potter, 
primarily because of passages in the Bible 
which proclaim the evils of witchcraft and 
wizardry. Behind that innocent face is 
the power of satanic darkness, says 
Pastor Jack Brock of Christ Community 
Church in Alamogordo, New Mexico. 
Harry Potter is the devil and he is 
destroying people. Last December the 
parish held a massive book burning, 
including Harry Potter and Stephen King 
books, as well as Ouijja boards and AC/DC 
records.
Whatever their take, many people cer
tainly react to this book strongly, which, 
for art, can sometimes be an indicator of 
lasting social impact. Whether future gen
erations think of him as a moral demon 
or a literary hero, Harry Potter has cer
tainly left his mark on the papyrus of our 
culture.

Fellowship of lunacy
Lord of the Rings sends the public reeling
Who could miss seeing a movie where 
trees come alive to wreak havoc on evil, 
elves and humans battle ores in one of the 
longest batdes in cinematic history, and 
two half-sized people called hobbits con
tinue their quest to destroy an evil ring of 
power? For some Carnegie Mellon stu
dents, the answer is an appalled, No 
one! and for others, the answer is, What 
movie?
Its the second installment of the 
movies based on J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord 
of the Rings, called The Two Towers. Made 
in New Zealand, it is the sequel to last 
years The Fellowship of the Ring, which 
won 13 Oscar nominations and drew even 
more admirers to its already impressive 
fan base.
Long-time fan Nick Chizzonite, a firstyear in H&SS, plans to see the movie as 
soon as it comes out. I cant wait for this 
movie! he said. He is most looking for
ward to everything ever, but especially 
his favorite characters, the creature 
Gollum and the race of tree-people called 
Ents. The trailers shown in movie theatres 
have been exciting glimpses for 
Chizzonite, but he said he doesnt want to 
actively seek spoilers which may ruin 
surprises that the film has in store.
Unlike Chizzonite, ECE first-year Alan 
Hayashi has only read the first half of the 
book The Fellowship of the Ring, but he 
looks forward to seeing The Two Towers 
just the same. I really enjoyed the first 
one, he said, adding, If they do an equal 
job [on the sequel] Ill be happy. He felt 
that director Peter Jackson did a good job 
cutting the less essential stuff from the 
book, making an effective transition from
book to film  something that was 
exceedingly difficult, considering that he 
had to convert roughly 1,000 pages to 
three movies lasting no more than three 
hours each. Though not a huge Tolkien 
fan himself, Hayashi said that three of his 
close friends from home would quote 
Tolkien and make jokes such as, Its the 
Ring! about any ring they came across. 
Hayashi also plans to most definitely see 
the film over break.
Other students see The Two Towers not 
as a must-see, but a good movie to watch 
if ever presented with the opportunity. 
First-year art student Nkechi Ebubedike 
said shell watch it, if I ever happen to be 
in a movie theater. She likes some fanta
sy and heard from many that the first 
movie was interesting, but feels no pres
sure to see the Lord of the Rings movies as 
soon as they come out. She can under
stand the passion of the oft-dubbed rabid 
fans by comparing it to how she would 
feel if one of her favorite singers came to 
town: she would do anything she could to 
see them perform.
Love it, like it, hate it, or indifferent, 
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is 
coming to theaters nationwide on 
December 18. Starring Elijah Wood, Sean 
Astin, Sir Ian McKellan, Liv Tyler, Orlando 
Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, and Christo
pher Lee, this movie promises to deliver a 
punch, including 40 minutes of full-out 
war on the fortress of Helms Deep, and 
introducing new characters that are sure 
to draw audiences further into the world 
of Tolkien.

Robot

Robot
Why CMU loves robots
and the rest of the
world fears themRobot. The very word instantly conjures up an image in the 
minds eye. Love them. Fear them. You cannot ignore them. 
What is it about our metallic creations that makes them so com
pelling  or even scary?
The Frankenstein Complex is a kind of technophobia defined 
as the unreasoning human fear of robots and  since robots 
are computer-controlled  of computers. Fifth-year senior 
Psychology and HCI major Scott Kaufman says, I am intimidat
ed by the danger of Robots to the human race, should they ever 
get to the stage where they can teach themselves things.
Much popular media echoes these fears: Terminator, The 
Matrix, and Westworld are all movies in which robots become, or 
are made self aware, and immediately began to destroy the 
human population, despising human beings for being less per
fect and for creating them to be slaves.
If and when we are able to create artificial intelligence, safe
guards will likely be installed for the protection of man. A classic 
example of this is Isaac Asimovs Three Laws of Robotics:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to harm;
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except 
where such orders would conflict with the First Law;
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such pro
tection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
Robots have become very much a part of our lives, whether 
they are speeding up production in an industrial setting, or 
destroying other robots in an arena for our amusement, and they 
are becoming still more common.
Many people have attempted to put robots to work. There 
have already been several autonomous lawnmowers developed, 
and more recently a robot vacuum cleaner has become available 
to consumers. A spoon robot has been developed to help dis
abled people to feed themselves, and a robot cart delivers meals 
to hospital patients. In the realm of mental health, a variety of 
comforting robot pets have been developed to cheer people up.
Says first-year business major Gabriel Cuthbert, I think in 
essence man is lazy, the better we make robots, the more work 
they will do for us and the more free time we will have.

Our goal is to build robots, said president Brian 
Kirby, a senior ECE major. You dont need special 
qualifications. If you like robots, you can just come 
and join.
You are standing in the middle of your very messy office on 
the first floor of Newell Simon. Suddenly, an oversized waste
basket on wheels, reminiscent of the Jetsons housekeeper 
Rosie the Robot, enters the room. She rolls around your 
office, picking up your dirty sweatpants and the remnants of 
a late-night pizza fest. Rosie is feeling chatty today; she cleans 
and vacuums your room while she reminds you to take your 
asthma medication.
It is the year 2002 and the US is on the verge of a war. But 
this is no ordinary war. Instead of the rugged, fatigue-clad 
armies of yesteryear, a giant armada of deadly robots rolls 
onto the battlefield. They are equipped with heat sensors, 
chemical weapons, and the latest advances in blasting-people-off-the-face-of-the-Earth technology. Science fiction or 
just a daily occurrence at Carnegie Mellon?
The Robotics Institute, housed in Newell Simon Hall on the 
west end of campus, has inspired more urban legends and 
exaggerated techie gossip than perhaps any other department
ties with many other CMU departments, including physics 
and psychology. It now collaborates on a myriad of research 
projects, from building personal robotic assistants for the eld
erly (Nursebots), to perfecting land rovers for space visits to 
Mars. Robotics projects at CMU are funded by NASA, private 
companies, the National Science Foundation, and most 
recently, the Department of Defense.
Our mission is to build smart machines, said Chuck 
Thorpe, director of the Robotics Institute, but ultimately, our 
scientific mission is to understand intelligence.
What we want is to give robots a sense of their surround
ings, so they can know where they are and move through the 
world, said Hans Moravec, a principal research scientist at 
the Institute. But if the goal is to build intelligent robots, can 
this technology be used for less-than-moral purposes? And 
what about the killer robots?
Thorpe elaborates on the Institutes recent involvement 
with the Department of Defense: We are involved in basic 
research and in educating students. If you are looking to build 
robots for a military purpose, this is the wrong place to do it.
was young, I used to build tin-can robots and I made a lightseeking robot for a high school science fair.
Though the traditional robot geek comes from a comput
er science or engineering background, not all of them started 
that way.
I started off as a pre-med, but then I got tired of memoriz
ing holes in skulls, said Thorpe. Robots are cool because 
they are tangible, they move, and act, and you can see them 
do it.
The one thing that ties these people together is their belief 
and passion for what technology can do.
I find it interesting as to how simple algorithms can seem
ingly exhibit high-level capabilities like exploring spaces, 
said Howie Choset, a robotics professor who teaches General 
Robotics. Translation: How simple programs can do powerful 
things.
Robots capture the most interesting thing about humani
ty: the mind, said Moravec.
One of Hans Moravecs research projects involves these robots 
which are able to map their terrain.
at CMU. But behind all the rumors lies a world made up by 
people who have one thing in common: they are all crazy 
about robots.
The Robotics Institute was founded in 1979 as a joint ven
ture between GSIA, ClT and SCS. As it grew in size, it forged
Housed in the Planetary Robotics Building adjacent to 
Newell Simon Hall, the headquarters of the CMU Robotics 
Club looks more like an industrial warehouse than the sleek, 
futuristic images we often see in science fiction movies. Bent 
over lab tables, a few members solder components into circuit 
boards, while others lounge on the couches. This is it. This is 
the home of the robot fanatics, those who spend weeks trying 
to get a robot to pierce grapes suspended in tubs of Jell-0 
(part of an actual competition).
Founded in 1984, the CMU Robotics Club is a student 
organization dedicated to  you guessed it  robots, robots, 
and more robots. The club has about 100 members and is one 
of the oldest known Robotics Clubs in the nation. It pitches 
itself as a social organization, free to all students, no 
matter what their technical expertise. This is not the 
image usually associated with a robotics organization.
But is there really a robot culture at CMU?
If we are working on a project, and we are still here at 11, 
well go grab something to eat at Fuel n Fuddle, but were not 
an exclusive group, said Kirby. Not really a clique, not really 
a culture. These are just a bunch of people that get together to 
work on robots because they are fascinated by them. Some 
are interested in the artificial intelligence aspect of robotics. 
Some love the real-world applications of robotics. And some 
are just crazy about robots.
)gRSh eg9gl- Fohwwytog
But do all the people involved in robotics have something 
in common? What makes a person love robots? What 
makes someone wake up one morning and say Hell, I 
want build robots! As with everything in the Robotics 
field, the answer is complex.
Some people didnt get into robots until a relatively 
late age. I didnt really work with robots until high 
school, when I went to the US First Robot 
Competition, said Kirby. But others have been fasci
nated with them since childhood.
I was inspired by the science-fiction world, like 
the novels of Isaac Asimov, said Moravec. When IGrace Li/Art Staff

Till death do us part
With big-time fights like Tyson/Lewis turning into big-time disappointments, a healthy 
alternative to boxing is essential these days. That alternative is found in robots, iconic 
machines sensationalized by science fiction that have ended up not as helpful problem solvers, 
but ass-kicking pugilists. Evidenced by the numerous robot fighting shows that have surfaced 
and submerged in the past few years, this sport has taken off and the true bot believers have 
stuck around, even in Pittsburgh.
Housed in a non-descript storefront within a strip mall in North Huntingdon, PA, the Robot 
Club and Grille is the first ever permanent robot fighting facility open to the public every day 
of the week. As well as renting robots, selling parts, and giving bot fighting classes, the Robot 
Club and Grille offers spectators premium robot combat action at competitions like last week
ends grand opening tournament.
Conceived and constructed by CMU graduate and Lycos founder Michael Fuzzy Mauldin, 
the Robot Club serves up mechanized mayhem in a family atmosphere. The place looks like a 
creepy Chuck E. Cheese where the robots try to kill each other instead of singing automated 
kiddie tunes. Children run about with balloons in hand, wearing wide grins as little Joey 
' Pittsburgh blows the candles out on his birthday cake with robots destroying each other in the 
background. Signed memorabilia from famous bot bouts line the wall near the entrance, 
allowing parents and their children to handle the cracked and ripped pieces of retired robots. 
Because watching inanimate machines duke it out and fondling the sports timepieces will 
make anyone hungry, the Robot Club and Grille has a kitchen to sate spectators hankerings 
and live up to the latter part of its name.
But this isnt merely a glitz and glamour, pro wrestling presentation of robot fighting, at all. 
Its just robots beating the hell out of each other. Three fighting arenas walled with seethrough, bulletproof panels are arranged throughout, the main stage occupying the center of 
the club and everyones attention. Robots of all types and sizes square off to the fans delight 
and, as the sparks fly, some children cry. This is, however, only an initial response, as kids soon 
get wrapped up in the action. With eyes wide, they dry their tears and crane their little necks 
to see between haggard, bespectacled men cheering on the carnage.
Though it may seem ridiculous, robot combat, along with the crowd it draws, is a com
pelling spectacle when witnessed firsthand. Bolts, blades, and metal shards of all kinds fly 
about the ring when the bots collide, evoking from the crowd exclamations aplenty. Most 
fights end when an incapacitated robot scoots about incoherently like a battered heavyweight 
bruiser with a bloody nose. With its armor busted and its battery dead, the brain-dead bot 
comes to a stop as the victorious machine hovers around like Muhammad Ali towering over 
Sonny Liston.
The pit area where all the robot teams prepare their fighters is a mess of activity where stone 
faced bot-building competitors rub shoulders, but remain focused in their frenzy. Participants 
devout devotion can even be seen in the clothes they wear, like a little girls bot humor t-shirt 
that reads, Watch out, boys. Were after your nuts.
Most intimidating of all the competing robots at last weekends tournament was Tornado 
Mer, a terrifying beast of a machine sure to shatter any cynical spectators preconceptions that 
robot combat is simply Rock em Sock em Robots. Weighing over 200 pounds, the robot has 
a low, circular base with a deadly, top-mounted helicopter blade that slices through the com
petition, granting the bot top billing. In the most wheels-off match of the tourney, Tornado 
Mer tore off two of its opponents wheels with the first hit and ended up whirling out of con
trol after being flipped on its side. Moving like a monstrous spinning wheel of death, Tornado 
Mer thrashed about, scorching the floor and tearing at the bulletproof paneling in a frenzy 
that left every spectators mouth agape. When the match ended and the smoke didnt clear, the 
crowd erupted in applause, commending the chaos in a show of bloodthirsty fanfare like that 
of a gladiator fight at the Colosseum. As the techies began to pick up the pieces and sweep up 
the robotic guts strewn about the floor, Billy Joels Piano Man started playing on the loud
speaker, bringing an air of calm and conclusion to the otherwise riotous festivities.
Many dismiss robot fighting as pure sideshow and a sport not worthy of spectatorship. They 
believe it is just another forum for needless violence being supported by carnage-loving kids 
and old men bored crazy. But there is something about witnessing a ten year old girl clobber
ing an obsessed middle-aged mans defining creation with her remote controlled agent of 
robot demolition that just puts a smile on your face.

The infamous Son of Whyachi" team builds killer robots with some frequency; this particular bot is 
on display in the memorabilia section of the Robot Club and Grille, having fought some time ago.

Weekly inspiration from the ominously brooding pond
o
Amy the Duck. She and Quackers were quite 
the pair back in those days, when we used to 
spend our days by the shore, and our evenings in 
the parlor, gabbing until early in the morn. I 
would sit back quietly at times, content simply 
to witness their jokes and smile at their flirting. Oh, they werent 
overt about it at all; on the contrary, they tried to be very discreet. 
But I saw their eyes. All was told in their eyes when they looked at 
each other  days spent together in secret by the pond, evening 
meetings in the meadow, and whispers at the window during the 
night. They were the image of true love. But all love must end some 
time, and so it did with these two, at the murderous hand of cruel 
fate. It tore me apart inside to see Quackers in his sadness at the sud
den loss of his dearest, for none were fairer, and none since have been 
as fair, as Amy the Duck.

December comic review
Stop buying cruddy gifts and give your loved ones comic
books this holiday season.
Hot off the Presses:
Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 : 
Coming Home TPB, by Babylon 
5 creator J. Michael Straczynski and classic Spidey artist 
John Romita Jr. This is some 
of the best storytelling the 
webbed crusader has seen in 
years, with a greater focus on 
character development. With 
Spider-Man mania at an alltime high, this makes a great 
gift for newcomers or classic 
fans.
Made for the Movies:
Ghost World, by Daniel 
Clowes. No tights and fights 
here. Clowes lends his nontraditional and very bold style 
to tell the story of two teenage 
girls who struggle to remain 
best friends. An A+ comic 
turned into an A+ movie.
Road to Perdition, by scribe 
Max Allan Collins and illustra
tor Richard Piers Rayner. The 
story follows two consecutive 
Courtesy of www.spiderfan.org father-son relationships in a 
family of mob hit men during 
the Depression era. More action-packed than the emotional film starring Tom Hanks and 
Paul Newman.
From Hell, by comics superstar 
Alan Moore and artist Eddie 
Campbell. This moody black and 
white opus, set in 1888s London, 
documents a clairvoyant cop on the 
trail of Jack the Ripper. Made into a 
gory film starring Johnny Depp in 
2001s
Gotta-Have Classics:
Batman: Year One, by famous 
Frank Miller and masterful David 
Mazzuccelli. As Lieutenant James 
Gordon arrives to his new precinct, 
young Bruce Wayne returns home to 
Gotham City. They will become 
allies against crime if they can make 
it through the first year alive.
Go to http://dotcomics.marvel.com to read all 22 pages of The Truth for free. This new 
Marvel comic by Robert Morales and Kyle. Baker tells the story of three black WWII sol
diers who were given the experimental super-soldier serum before Steve Rogers, the 
man who would become Captain America.

Montyby Jim Meddick
Hellboy: Seed of Destruction, by 
Mike Mignola. Combine one part 
wise-ass action hero and one part 
classic folktales from around the 
world. Stir well. Stunning illustra
tions and tasty tales make for a truly 
paranormal experience.

Year-long horoscopes
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): When PETA carts you away in a 
small, splintery box, you will realize that bringing your pet turtles 
to chemistry lab was not very smart. Besides, it would have taken 
years for them to become full-grown expert ninjas anyway.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Be strong. You are in for a rude 
awakening when you return home for winter break after a semes
ter of being comparatively cool and hip in the Carnegie Mellon 
social environment.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): The next time 
youre trekking through a sparsely populated for
est region, just remember that you have nothing 
to worry about. Unattractive people are less 
appealing to cannibals.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Your monkey army idea may 
sound promising, but a near-deadly insurrection by a monkey with 
superior leadership skills who doesnt respect your authority will 
prove otherwise.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): No matter what she tells you, you 
can still take pride in representing natural selections sense of 
humor.
VARiaO VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Your parents 
will finally realize just how indoctrinated you were 
by Captain Planet as a child when you request 
multicolored recycle bins for your holiday gift.
LIBRA (September 23 - 
October 23): You will return 
home for break to find that not only did your 
parents get rid of your room, but they also neg
lected to tell you they moved, stranding you in 
frozen cow country with nothing but old 
copies of Readers Digest to keep you company. UBRft
Vanessa Shyu/Art Staff
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21):
Your grandma welcomes you home with open arms, as long as you 
concede that youre wasting away in your unmarried state and 
agree to go on a blind date with her bingo friend Cookies medical 
school student grandchild.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): You will decide 
that Chanukah is not the only Festival of Lights when your 
Christmas decorations explode and your dorm catches fire, creat
ing a stunning light spectacle for all the evacuated tenants to enjoy 
for hours.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Refusing to believe 
that her little child has grown up, your mom will again guilt trip 
you into performing in the annual Christmas pageant as baby 
Jesus.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Only after a violent 
physical reaction will you realize that the blue cheese you found in 
your fridge was not blue when you bought it before Thanksgiving.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): You will 
soon go though a body art phase which will not 
end until you recognize that your body really is a 
temple, as evidenced by the tiny space creatures 
that pray to you while you sleep.
