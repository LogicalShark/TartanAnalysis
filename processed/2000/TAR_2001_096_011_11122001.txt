In his State of the University 
address, Carnegie Mellon 
President Jared Cohon referred 
to the strategic plan he and 
roughly one hundred faculty 
crafted three years ago as a 
source of direction and a frame of 
reference in which to gauge his 
administrations productivity.
According to various members 
of the campus community, Cohen 
has been producing good results 
since his inauguration, and now, 
in the fifth year of his presidency, 
he continues to do so.
I think Jerry Cohon is espe
cially good at knowing all the fac
ulty and what is going on with 
the faculty, and that is important 
with some of the major initiatives 
on campus, said H&SS Dean 
John Lehoczsky.
While Cohon is achieving many 
of his administrative objectives,

formed about the Presidents activities and performance 
on critical campus issues such as the Silicon Valley branch 
campus, but that they also experience difficulty spotting

STUDENTS QUESTION PRESIDENTS LACK 
OF INTERACTION WITH CMU COMMUNITY
Tenure marked by efforts in diversity, fundraising
by Sara Henneberger
News Editor
A university president faces significant chal
lenges as the leader, lobbyist, fund raiser, exter
nal representative, and policy maker of an acad
emic institution. Carnegie Mellon Universitys 
President, Jared Cohon is no exception and has 
the jam-packed schedule to prove it. As a presi
dent of a major university, he has an enormous 
quantity of demands upon his time, said 
Michael Murphy, Dean of Student Affairs. 
Cohons work has largely paid off during his 
four year, three month tenure at Carnegie 
Mellon, as he has caught the momentum of his
predecessors and moved forward with policy 
and initiative goals of his own. However, 
University students remain largely unaware of 
the Presidents policies and actions. While many 
students would not be interested in the minute 
details of each day of the Presidents University 
life, others believe that they could benefit from 
an increased awareness of President Cohons 
major priorities that shape their educational 
and campus experiences.
Honestly, I dont really know what the 
Presidents job is, said Samantha Haedrich, a 
senior design major. I would think that he is 
supposed to represent our school on a more 
national level of academic relations.
I am not sure what executive orders
President Cohon has issued or actions he has 
taken, but the school seems to be run well, said 
Jon Chu, a senior electrical and computer engi
neering major.
According to a survey conducted by The 
Tartan, many students do not know what the 
President does in the areas of diversity on cam
pus, fundraising, environmentalism, academics, 
and external collaborations. On average, 25 
percent of undergraduates and 33 percent of 
graduates felt that they could not accurately 
rate the Presidents performance in any of those 
major categories due to a lack of information.
[Cohons work with outside agencies is] 
largely invisible to students, said John

which Namey attributes in part to 
the ease of online voting.
The recent voter participation 
rate marks an increase from the

During a mass demonstra
tion for peace last Friday,
motorcycles followed the 
marchers, which included stu
dents and community mem
bers.
The peace march began at 
approximately 4:30 pm at 
Carnegie Mellons Fence. The 
demonstrators marched to the 
Software Engineering Institute, 
known in part for its alliance 
with the Department of 
Defense, and then proceeded to 
the front porch of the William 
Pitt Union on the corner of 
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow 
Boulevard. Public responses 
ranged from peace signs of sup
port to pro-war bystanders 
shouting, five thousand 
Americans died. Students 
from Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh and 
members of religious groups, 
labor unions, and social action 
committees comprised the 
group of demonstrators.
The Pittsburgh Anti-War 
Coalition organized the event. 
The coalition issued an 
explanatory statement reading, 
in part, While we condemn the 
attacks of September 11, we 
also condemn the brutal 
assault that the US government 
is carrying out in Afghanistan 
... at the same time, the US gov
ernment is attacking democrat
ic rights at home. The coali
tion also joins national political 
parties in condemning racist 
attacks on individuals of 
Islamic descent or belief.
While the march was the 
most visible part of the event, 
the speeches at William Pitt 
Union made the demonstration 
cohesive. We are faced with 
generalizations by people who 
either hate us or dont know 
us, said Nazeeh Othman, an 
Islamic speaker referring to the 
attacks on people of Islamic 
faith that have occurred since 
September 11. Lisa Krebs, a 
senior double major in music 
and English at CMU delivered a 
speech that protested wide
spread insensitivity of 
American foreign policy. It is 
ignorance of American foreign 
policy that caused the attacks 
of September 11. American for
eign policy has consistently dis
regarded human rights, said 
Krebs.
The event went really well,

sophomore philosophy major 
and a member of the Carnegie

On Friday, November 9, Carnegie Mellon University received an award from the Pittsburgh 
Region of Clean Cities. The Clean Cities Program, sponsored by the US Department of 
Energy, supports public-private partnerships that deploy alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) 
and build supporting infrastructures. By encouraging AFV use, the Clean Cities Program 
helps enhance energy security and environmental quality at both the national and local 
levels. Carnegie Mellon received the award because in the past year, the University has 
purchased two FMS vehicles and one police car that run on natural gas.
Student Senators elected through online voting system; participation 10 percent
THIS WEEK IN THE TARTAN
by Ross Krupnik
Junior Staffwriter
Students elected Senators last 
week to represent their respective 
colleges in student government. 
The electoral process was conduct
ed entirely through an online vot
ing system that student govern
ment plans to utilize in future elec
tions.
However, the Democratic 
process didnt quite work for 
College of Fine Arts students. A 
human error let voters only write 
in two candidates, despite the fact
that three slots were to be filled.
Three senators were selected, 
including Jason Petz who won a 
mere three votes. Student Senate 
officials could not be reached for 
comment by press time to discuss 
the incident.
Approximately 10 percent of the 
student body participated in the 
election. According to Brain 
Namey, a junior ethics, history, 
and public policy major and 
Student Body Vice President, the 
campus-wide student government 
elections last spring also garnered 
a 10 percent participation rate, but 
the elections were more competi
good fall participation will set the 
precedent for an awesome spring 
[election].
Namey believes that online vot
ing will ultimately bring Student 
Government closer to the students. 
With the system in place, students 
were able to securely log on to the 
ballot page and cast their votes for 
student senators. Its more conve
nient to click on a link to cast your 
ballot, said Namey. He added that 
although the voting system 
worked well, in future elections 
Student Government will make the 
elections results more quickly

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 12, 2001
Cohon catches momentum of predecessors, moves forward with policy and goals
ISSUES, from page A1
Lehoczky, dean of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences. 
Students benefit from this in the 
courses they are able to take and 
the research they can do here  
but that the President is doing it 
would be totally invisible to the stu
dents.
Diversity
Since the start of his career at 
. Carnegie Mellon, President Cohon 
h^s touted University-wide diversi
ty as a major personal goal. 
Diversity issues have been a big 
issue for the President, in terms of 
faculty, staff, and student recruit
ment, and campus culture, said 
Dean Murphy.
. There is heightened sensitivity 
about diversity [at Carnegie 
Mellon] because I am personally 
committed to it and because I 
. thought it was important for the 
University for the President to be 
physically and forcefully out front 
about it, said President Cohon. 
The President chairs the Diversity 
Advisory Council, which is in its 
third year, and includes members 
from all areas of the University and 
from the Pittsburgh region. The 
"council spent its first two years 
deliberating the problems of diver
sity at CMU  including the 
urieven ratio between females and 
males and the low number of both 
faculty and student African 
Americans  and last spring, it 
released proposals for improving 
qampus diversity. According to 
President Cohon, the council will 
soon begin the implementation of 
its proposals, the details of which 
have yet to be released to the cam
pus community.
Cohon acknowledges that diver
sity is a long-term goal for the 
University and that the full benefits 
of programs implemented during 
fyis time at CMU may not be felt for 
many years. Indira Nair, ViceProvost for Education, believes that 
diversity poses a complex dilemma 
to the University. [The President] 
has taken diversity as a serious 
challenge and he means it, but I 
feel that we have a long way to go, 
said Nair, noting that the popula
tion of African American students 
on campus consistently remains 
between 4 and 5 percent. A mem
ber of the Diversity Council, Nair 
says that while the council is a good 
idea, the members do not make 
controversial statements or deliber
ately provoke one another into 
heated, potentially fruitful debates. 
I dont think that President Cohon 
invites conflict, said Nair. I think 
there has to be conflict before we 
will get better [about diversity]. 
Many of us have to get angry before 
things will get better.
Cohon noted that during the past 
year, the number of African 
American faculty has risen from 10 
to 17. While an improvement, 
Cohon acknowledges that 17 
African Americans out of 740 facul
ty members does not constitute 
diversity.
Fundraising
Carnegie Mellon hired President 
Cohon at the beginning of its cen
tennial capital campaign five years 
ago, and fundraising has com
prised a significant portion of 
Cohons job ever since. 
Fundraising is one of my highest 
priorities, said Cohon, noting that 
nothing at the University is possible 
without money. Cohon estimates 
that he spends one third of his time 
engaging in fundraising activities.
Jim Morris, dean of the School of 
Computer Science, believes that 
Cohons primary job as a University 
president is, and should be, 
fundraising. He should get credit 
for successfully completing the cap
ital campaign, said Morris. The 
University originally set a cam
paign goal of $350 million, but 
raised $410 million. Despite the 
achievement of the campaign, 
Carnegie Mellon continues to 
struggle with a low endowment 
and will embark on another capital 
campaign within the next year.
In his November 2000 State of 
the University Address to Faculty 
Senate, Cohon addressed the lin
gering financial problems of CMU. 
Cohon said that CMU did not begin 
to invest its endowment in venture 
capital until 1997, long after many 
other universities in Carnegie 
Mellons tier made such invest
ments. Carnegie Mellons national 
endowment rank fell from 42 in
1995 to 63 in 2001.
Part of Carnegie Mellons fledg
ing endowment results from low 
alumni giving. Currently, only 29 
percent of alumni donate to the 
University, yet Rears Pollock, 
University trustee and co-chair of 
the presidential review committee, 
believes that Cohon has expressed 
an aptitude for alumni relations. I 
think Carnegie Mellon has done a 
much better job in the past five 
years than in previous half-decades 
in terms of reaching out to its 
alums and getting them more 
involved, said Pollock.
Morris suggested that a gradual 
improvement in campus climate 
might eventually increase alumni 
giving, for he personally has found 
that the Universitys most signifi
cant donations have come from 
people not affiliated with Carnegie 
Mellon.
The biggest donations Ive got
ten have come from people who 
didnt go to CMU, said Morris, 
adding that when he was a student 
at Carnegie Mellon during the 
1960s, student morale was very 
low and may now hinder the 
University from receiving large 
alumni gifts. He suggested that 
more administrative interaction 
with todays students could lead to 
more alumni giving in the future.
Environmentalism
Carnegie Mellon gained national 
recognition this fall when it 
became a major purchaser of wind 
energy. With a background in envi
ronmentalism, Cohon said that 
deciding to purchase 5 percent of 
the Universitys energy from a 
Somerset wind farm seemed like
the right thing to do. He also 
commented that CMUs new status 
as the countrys third largest pur
chaser of wind energy has brought 
increased national attention to the 
University. The notoriety was very 
nice and created a lot of pride 
among students and faculty, said 
Cohon. The next step is to get 
more students and faculty involved 
in environmentalism. Despite an 
effort toward clean energy, the 
Universitys recycling policies 
remain largely ineffective. Were 
really lousy at recycling, and I dont 
know why, said Cohon. I cant tell 
if our policies are not what they 
should be, or if the execution of the 
practices is in error.
Joel Tarr, professor of history at 
CMU, believes that although the 
University possesses strong 
resources in environmental engi
neering, the social aspects of envi
ronmentalism on campus go over
looked. We dont have any ecolo
gists on campus at all, said Tarr. 
You could also say that in the 
social sciences we dont have any
one looking systematically into the 
area of environment and politics 
and environmental policy. Tarr 
commented that it could be diffi
cult for the University to develop an 
effective environmental program 
without a concentrated group of 
environmentalists. Compared to 
the cluster of environmental engi
neers, we have a scattering [of 
environmentalists in other areas]. 
Its hard to develop an environmen
tal program with such a scatter
ing.
Academics
Although students ranked acade
mic development as the most 
important duty of a university pres
ident, many professors believe that 
the direction of academic programs 
at Carnegie Mellon is ultimately in 
the hands of the faculty. Academic 
programs are not something the 
President dictates, said Nair. Its 
something the deans and particu
larly the departments decide. The 
President has been very respectful 
of that. But at the same time, one of 
the initiatives he put as a priority is 
broadening the Carnegie Mellon 
education.
According to Lehoczky, Cohon 
has continued a campus trend 
toward interdisciplinary education, 
as begun by former University pres
ident Dick Cyert. Cyert reinforced 
interdisciplinary study and made it 
enduring. Interdisciplinary study is 
something that Cohon is in synch 
with, but it is not an invention of 
his, said Lehoczky.
Cohon is especially interested in 
pursuing programs that intertwine 
the arts and the humanities. The 
Bachelors of Humanities and Arts 
(BHA) program was a recent addi
tion to the academic offerings at 
Carnegie Mellon along with the 
newly developed Center for Arts 
and Society, which provides 
avenues to study social policy 
issues through artistic ventures. 
Cohon credits students with the 
formation of the BHA program, 
and commented that the Center for
35% r
0%
Arts and Society resulted 
from faculty and adminis
trators catching up with 
the ideas of students.
It would be very, very 
rare for a senior adminis
trator  lets say a presi
dent  to be the inventor 
of an [academic] pro
gram, said Lehoczky. 
There has to be passion 
and leadership at the facul
ty level for new programs
 but administrators are 
crucial for carrying out 
ideas. In the end, all the 
good ideas are bottom-up, 
coming from faculty and 
students.
Beyond an interest in 
promoting interdiscipli
nary programs, Cohon has 
also focused on extra-curricular educational oppor
tunities, saying that he 
seeks seamlessness 
between academics and 
extra-curricular activities. 
Previous CMU President 
Mehrabian established a 
precedent for lecture series 
and life-skills seminars at 
CMU, and Cohon has 
worked towards the 
expansion and enrich
ment of those programs.
External
collaboration
As the external represen
tative of all University 
affairs, President Cohon 
faces the responsibility of 
forming alliances with 
research institutes, corpo
rations, and other universi
ties. Current administra
tive projects include a 
biotechnology venture 
with the University of 
Pittsburgh, the Panther 
Hollow development  
which has been in consid
eration for the past 40 
years, according to Cohon
 and the west coast 
branch campus. According to 
Cohon, Carnegie Mellon faces an 
extra incentive to form outside 
alliances because of its connection 
to Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellons 
success is intimately tied to 
Pittsburghs success, said Cohon.
The locale of where any univer
sity is located has to do with 
whether you go there or not. Part of 
the attractiveness of a city is its eco
nomic vitality. If you dont have 
economic vitality, you dont have 
social vitality or entertainment 
opportunities.
Cohon has worked on the 
Pittsburgh Digital Greenhouse pro
ject, which is a collaboration 
between Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, 
Penn State University, the 
Pennsylvania state government, 
and 25 companies to bring comput
er chip system production to 
Pittsburgh. According to Cohon, 
several of the Pittsburgh-based 
companies employ recent CMU 
graduates.

Mistaken Identity
Many students, faculty, and staff were unfamilar with the performance of President 
Cohon in regards to the Universitys collaboration with Intel, the establishing of ties 
with government and corporations, and academic programs. Rather than rating the 
Presidents performance, survey participants marked no response to indicate that 
they did not know the Presidents performance in the given areas. The information 
flow was further complicated by an indentity crisis: Only 55% of undergraduates 
surveyed could pick Cohons photograph out of five recognizable faculty and admin
istrators. 14.8% of undergraduate respondents selected Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy as the University President.
as their connection to outside 
financial supporters, although 
Morris pointed out some limita
tions in the current biotechnology 
venture. The President will have 
to do something drastic to get 
biotechnology to a high level [at 
CMU], said Morris, adding that 
the collaboration with Pitt has been 
limited because of Pitts advance
ment in the field compared to 
Carnegie Mellon. Morris suggested 
that the University instead contin
ue to establish itself as an informa
tion technology center to gain more 
recognition and financial and 
research opportunities.
Picking up the momentum
From fundraising and academics 
to diversity and environmentalism, 
President Cohon has picked up the 
momentum of his predecessors and 
of the campus community to shape 
current University policies. While 
students are relatively uninformed 
about the Presidents goals and 
actions, faculty members express 
knowledge of the Presidents actions
and openly give both support and 
suggestions to Cohons initiatives.
Some students express that they 
could ultimately benefit from 
increased knowledge about the 
Universitys direction and the 
Presidents policies. [Cohon] is 
the liaison between our University 
and the rest of the world, said Josh 
Gerlick, a junior business adminis
tration major. He is the face that 
represents us, the voice that speaks 
on our behalf, and the mind that 
determines what is in our best 
interest. Therefore, concludes 
Gerlick, the more interaction 
[with the campus], the better.
I believe the president is doing a 
good job, said Kavita Arora, a 
junior electrical and computer engi
neering major. I think, though that 
by being more visible, the president 
could enhance his role on campus 
and students would get a chance to 
familiarize themselves with the 
integral part he plays in the major 
(decision making that goes on in this 
University.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 12, 2001
Presidents strategic plan extracts Universitys past interdisciplinary achievements
ANALYISIS, from page A1
uate education.
Five years ago this November, 
the Trustees conducted a review 
of the administration and 
Mehrabian. As the trustees con
vene today to discuss the progress 
of the University, the Presidential 
Review Committee continues an 
analysis of President Jared Cohon 
and his administration, as is stan
dard protocol at CMU and most 
institutions.
The Review Committee
The committee will elicit feed
back not only on CMU adminis
tration, but also the vision, poli
cies, and the execution of the 
schools strategic plan. The group 
will examine different bench
marks such as endowment perfor
mance, first year attrition rates, 
and the Universitys ranking or 
stature in the general populace. 
The review commission will 
report their findings to the public
 a major step toward open com
munication for a private college 
that rarely makes Trustee reports 
or meeting notes available for 
review.
I think the process is very con
structive. You get a range of 
responses .... [and] you certainly 
get some points where people 
would like to see some improve
ment or change, said review 
committee co-chair Rears Pollock.
Until the report is finalized in 
December, committee members 
will interview over 100 faculty 
and staff members, students and 
community leaders, whose infor
mation will be kept anonymous. 
Pollock is secure that the report 
will provide Cohon, the Trustees, 
and the faculty insights into how 
the school can improve.
An interdisciplinary 
vision
As much as Mehrabian attempt
ed to build upon the successes of 
his predecessor, Cohon has 
advanced a similar strategy, as 
evidenced by one of his earliest
projects, the strategic plan.
In the Universitys roadmap, he 
called for greater faculty, admin
istration, and student diversity. 
He also tied the regions growth 
and economic health' to CMU. 
Two tenets have provided visible 
changes within the structure of 
Carnegie Mellon. The plan called 
for the broadening of the CMU 
education and developing the dis
ciplines of biotechnology, infor
mation technology, environmen
tal practices, and the relation 
between arts and society.
While his vision appears to be a 
catalyst of cutting-edge ideas, 
Cohons last two action items 
draw heavily upon the schools 
interdisciplinary past. According 
to Vice Provost for Education 
Indira Nair, the interdisciplinary 
characteristics have existed since 
Robert Doherty headed Carnegie 
Tech in the 1930s. Carnegie 
Mellon always had problem-solv
ing as the cornerstone of our 
research and education, said 
Nair.
The argument is also explicitly 
stated in the Universitys vision 
statement. Carnegie Mellon will 
be a leader among education 
institutions by building on its tra
ditions of innovation, problem 
solving and interdisciplinary col
laboration.
While Cohons interaction and 
understanding of academic issues 
appears to have satisfied many 
faculty members, it is his vision 
that draws question. The fore
sight he purports for the 
University remains unclear and 
even acquiescent to many faculty.
It is worth noting that not since 
Doherty altered the methods of 
technical teaching have adminis
trators encroached upon the 
Presidents ability to drastically 
reformulate the direction of a 
young institution of higher learn
ing so quickly with the exception 
of Cyert.
Dr. Cyerts big issue was that 
we needed to leverage the great 
excellence we had in various cen
ters to international prominence.
In the 80s and 90s we ran the 
risk that if we werent careful in 
the 60s and 70s, we could 
become another really great 
regional technical and arts 
school, said Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy.
Cyert closed the Margaret 
Morrison Womens College, 
founded the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, 
and allocated additional 
resources to the School of 
Computer Science.
Cyerts decisiveness provided 
students, faculty, and alumni 
with a clear idea of the schools 
direction. However, past and curNair. She sees Cohon not as the 
type of leader who creates con
flict. To increase diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon, she views no 
alternatives than to confront the 
issue with unmasked honesty.
The diversity issue appears to 
be a microcosm of Cohons vision 
for CMU, or lack thereof.
Where he may be vulnerable is 
in formulating some sort of vision 
for the University and I think 
maybe people havent heard that 
from him, said adjunct professor 
Jim Davidson. History professor 
and University stalwart Joel Tarr 
concurred.
I also think that its true that
Jared Cohon
rent administrators questioned 
President Cohons ability to make 
critical and possibly offensive 
decisions. They point to diversity 
as an issue that will require hard
line stances and possibly unpopu
lar pronouncements.
 [Diversity] is clearly a priority 
of his and one that in an unusual 
way demonstrably showed by 
chairing this Diversity Advisory 
Council, said Murphy.
While Cohons commitment to 
increasing the number of under
represented ethnicities and socio
economic backgrounds draws few 
criticisms, it is his affable persona 
that draws a slight ire from facul
ty and administrators, including
Robert Mehrabian
while the University has talked 
about its goals, its not always 
clear what its movement is 
towards.
An inauspicious start
Cohon came to the University in 
July 1997. His tenure commenced 
with two of the most important 
developments of any institution of 
higher learning. The largest 
fundraising effort in school history, 
dubbed the Centennial Campaign, 
and the development of the 
Universitys strategic plan required 
his immediate attention.
On March 16, 1996 Mehrabian 
announced that he was leaving the 
school to be closer to his wife, who
had moved to California a year ear
lier to be near to her ill parents.
His departure did not rouse par
ticularly saddened responses from 
the student body. Students general
ly viewed his leave as an extension 
of his already distant connection to 
the University community.
How can I miss someone Ive 
never seen, retorted one Carnegie 
Mellon undergraduate.
His leaving came four months 
after the Board of Trustees presi
dential review committee gave 
Mehrabian a contract extension. 
The decision to retain Mehrabian 
appeared to be a celebrated mark 
for Carnegie Mellon. The 
University had undergone a build
ing expansion and Mehrabian had 
reduced the mass exodus of firstyear undergraduates that had 
plagued Cyerts term. Mehrabian 
had also improved the advising sys
tem for undergraduate education, 
forging a bond between advisor 
and student, according to Dean 
Murphy.
While the findings were not 
made public, the trustees did cau
tion Mehrabian that his schedule 
should understand the critical 
nature of CMUs fundraising cam
paign, set to take off in 1997.
It was felt that it was particular
ly important that some of his time 
be freed up now because the 
University is about to begin the 
Campaign for Carnegie Mellon, 
said trustee Thomas McConomy.
As with any fundraising drive, 
the ability to break bread and 
establish relationships with alum
ni would be critical. Mehrabian 
had already illustrated a propensi
ty to be distant from the faculty. 
Deans and faculty interviewed by 
The Tartan noted that Cohon is 
more knowledgeable of the faculty 
and their goals than his predeces
sor.
While Mehrabian was awarded 
a contract extension, concern 
existed with faculty and adminis
trators that the Centennial 
Campaign would need a visible 
and personable leader to make the 
project successful.
Cohons Future
Cohon may have walked into a 
rustbelt town, but Carnegie 
Mellon has remained vibrant as a 
whole. However, he did enter a 
college community that needed a 
massive fundraising effort to 
boost the schools sagging endow
ment. Students and faculty were 
dissatisfied with Mehrabians 
interaction. At a school that prid
ed itself on its ability to reinvent 
its operation often, the status quo 
of multidisciplinary education had 
begun to set in. Now Cohon must 
continue to reap the seeds of an 
alumni base that is slowly regain
ing an attachment to the 
University.
Our percentage of giving has 
dropped the last 10 years by 11 
percent to 27, 28 percent of gradu
ates, said Alumni Association 
President and senior lecturer in 
the School of Computer Science 
James Tomayko.
SCS Dean Jim Morris noted the 
priority that Cohon gives to inter
action with todays students. He 
argued that more interaction with 
students could lead to more alum
ni giving, as students might feel a 
greater sense of community.
Cohons most daunting task lies 
not only in alumni and student 
relations, but the ability to ensure 
faculty satisfaction with his vision. 
Administrators and teachers alike 
do not argue with his macro-management style of academia, but 
demand a clearer idea of the 
Universitys direction into the 
future.
Carnegie Mellon is the kind of 
institution that is always challeng
ing itself, and saying are we doing 
well enough, noted trustee 
Pollock.
In the same grain, Cohon must 
continue to challenge convention
al wisdom, not for his own securi
ty, but for that of a small technical 
school that became an interna
tional Mecca of multidisciplinary 
research and education.
Christopher Chung 
contributed to this article.
Opinions divided about role Cohon should play in academics, student life
INTERACTION, from page A1 
one significant issue which is 
worth looking at is the apparent 
lack of connection between the 
administration and the student 
body. A recent survey conducted 
by The Tartan, as well as numer
ous student interviews, have 
revealed a general lack of student 
awareness of the presidents pres
ence and 'accessibility on campus 
(see graphs).
The effects of Cohons adminis
tration may be felt across campus, 
but most students do not seem to 
recognize the connection 
between President Cohon and, 
for instance, the Arts Pass pro
gram, the recent and ongoing 
establishment of Carnegie 
Mellons west coast campus, and 
the new Bachelor of Science and 
Arts program.
In addition, some students do 
not even have expectations of 
what the presidents job encom
passes. Terrence Wong, a sopho
more computer science major, 
expressed this common senti
ment, saying that he simply has 
no idea what the president 
does.
This could be partially due to 
the irregularity of students inter
actions with Cohon. He said he is 
a frequenter of football games 
and other student gatherings 
throughout campus, but never
theless maintains a low-key pres
ence.
The time Cohon spends with 
students is generally meeting 
with student advisory commit
tees, walking the campus to see 
what students are up to, [and] 
going to student events. When 
personally invited to student 
events he says he is hesitant to 
decline, especially when such 
events present an opportunity for 
student interaction.
Cohon said that if he had an 
eighth day which no one else had, 
I would spend it hanging out 
with faculty and students. I cant 
really know what is going on just 
by talking with vice presidents 
and deans.
However, a clear definition for 
Carnegie Mellons most executive 
position remains elusive. Dean of 
Computer Science James Morris 
believes that Cohon should spend 
90 percent of his time fundraising 
and divide up his remaining ener
gy among a host of other activi
ties.
Dean of the Mellon College of 
Science Rick McCullough 
believes that the first priority of 
the President should be promot
ing the reputation of Carnegie 
Mellon and raising money.
Student Body Vice President 
Brian Namey contends that it is 
not within the scope of the 
Presidents responsibilities to be a 
point of administrative contact 
for students.
The channels that students 
have to the administration are 
student government leaders, 
said Namey. We have a more 
direct conduit to the appropriate 
administration.
President Cohon has personally 
made a concerted effort to find
the time didnt go unused. It has 
not been filled up for at least a 
year. I dont know if that is bad 
communication, or students not 
being interested, or students 
being intimidated by the 
prospect. But, they are not com
ing.
Cohon believes that it is essen
tial that I know what is on stu
dents minds  whats making 
you happy, whats making you 
mad, what ideas you have  I get 
some wonderful ideas from stu
dents. I wish I had more time for 
that.
Charlie Butcosk, a junior ECE 
and English double major, sees 
the role of the President as ah 
administrator thats naturally 
distanced from the reality of stu"... students feel disconnected from the 
school and don't trust the administration 
as a whole, which to a certain extent is a 
failure on his [Cohons]part.
 Junior Charlie Butcosk
ways of connecting with stu
dents. This year he started invit
ing students into the Presidential 
box at football games. He also 
invites between 80 and 100 
seniors over to his home at fairly 
regular intervals for what he calls 
mocktails.
Samantha Haedrich, a senior 
design major, said of the mocktail 
gathering that while she had 
never seen the President on cam
pus ... I actually spoke to him at 
the dinner  met him and his 
wife for a minute or so.
Cohon admits, I dont spend 
enough time with students. But I 
never can, and I never will.
Aside from the mocktail gettogethers and box office invita
tions, Cohon argues that in the 
nature of my job, that if I dont 
make it happen  if I dont 
schedule it  it wont happen. ... 
An hour or two towards the end 
of the day, I try to do it once or 
twice a month  and walk 
around the campus with Dean 
Murphy.
Additionally, he holds regular 
office hours once a month. 
However, Cohon said, [I] cant 
remember the last time I had stu
dent office hours where part of
dent life.
He also said that students feel 
disconnected from the school and 
dont trust the administration as a 
whole, which to a certain extent 
is a failure on his [Cohons] part. 
No president with student well
being in mind would let Dining 
Services deteriorate as it has, 
Housing become so bold-faced in 
its attempts to filch money from 
students, and generally leave the 
students feeling disaffected and 
disenfranchised.
Jonathan Chu, a senior in ECE 
offered a suggestion echoed by 
Butcosk: A weekly report or 
email from the President summa
rizing what the school adminis
tration has done recently would 
be helpful, but the President does 
not need to go out personally and 
tell students what he has done in 
the past week.
Thus the problem is not so 
much President Cohons seeming 
absence but rather the absence of 
quality communication between 
his administration and the stu
dent body.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy said in my hon
est opinion: if thats the percep
tion, then Im not doing my job....
I dont think its a fair expectation 
to say that the President should 
be out there, personally, with his 
hand on the pulse of all the vari
ous constituencies.
One common suggestion from 
both the students and faculty in 
addressing the disconnection is to 
capitalize on pre-existing chan
nels of communication and to not 
necessarily let the burden of that 
communication fall specifically 
on Cohon.
As Wong said, it is the stu
dents job to contact the President 
when necessary and for the 
President to be available but not 
necessarily look for interaction 
directly.
Dean of H&SS John Lehoczky 
reflected on his own experience: 
I wrestle with this issue myself 
as a dean, and not being well 
connected with students. I think 
whats good is rather than a 
president coming and delivering 
an address on an issue and stu
dents coming to listen and 
maybe occasionally asking ques
tions, what would be useful is to 
have a group discussion  stu
dents tend to feed off of each 
other and you could have a real
ly interesting dialogue and a lot 
of good ideas  criticisms too 
come out.
I would suggest that regularly 
... at least a couple of times a 
month, have a discussion. Rotate 
the students that are in there and 
dont just focus on one issue for 
the discussion. It could really 
increase the contact [between 
students and president] and give 
students a chance. And while it 
might only be 20 students at a 
time, if you keep doing that, 
month after month, it could be 
really helpful.
Associate Dean of H&SS, Jay 
Devine said, Casual, non-issue 
oriented discussions are rare 
[between students and faculty], 
so I have a weekly lunch with five 
random students each week, and 
I let the discussion run very freely 
in terms of the issues that arise.
Ive started to see themes in 
the discussions and now, seven or 
eight weeks into the discussion, 
Ive met 40 students I might not 
otherwise have met, and one of 
the things theyre coming away 
with, is that they have a channel 
to the college administration that 
they may not have had.
Cohon himself suggested reinstituting a sort of open town hall 
experience in order to reconnect 
with the students. He imagines 
just showing up, and whoever 
wants to come, comes, and I 
might say a few words, and then 
we open it up for questions and 
interaction. Id love to do more of 
those.
He openly admitted that I can 
do a better job of communicating 
[with students] and that I 
should.
Cohon concedes to the impor
tance of his visibility and the rela
tive value of maintaining open
lines of communication with the 
student body but at the same time 
doubts whether students would 
truly be interested in his ongoing 
activities.
I acknowledge how important 
it is that students have interac
tion with me and see me and 
know what I do, but it is hard to 
communicate all that I do to all 
the students, and given the effort 
 the expense, the use of my 
time, et cetera, that has to go into 
it  is it really worth it in terms 
of the benefits that students get 
from it?
The collection of survey data
Between November 1 and 7, 2001, The 
Tartan randomly sampled the opinions of over 
130 University community members through 
an online survey. Emails were distributed to 
approximately 420 University-affiliated per
sons, selected via a random number generator 
coupled with the Faculty/Staff directory and 
Undergraduate/Graduate student directory. 
The survey asked respondents to rate the 
Presidents performance, interaction, and com
munication with their peer group. Several 
questions specific to either students or facul
ty/staff were included. The data was compiled 
only after the survey was disabled to ensure 
that the results were reliable and representative 
of the Carnegie Mellon community. A nonUniversity affiliated statistician was consulted 
to assist the Tartan staff with the validity of the 
survey questionnaiare, its distribution, and the 
compilation of data.

SPECIAL ADVANCE SCREENING
THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 12, 2001
Anti-war march draws counter-rally 
from Pitt, CMU Dems and Republicans
PROTEST, from page A1 
largest and best planned event that 
the anti-war groups in Pittsburgh 
have had so far, and it was because 
weve worked together. Involved 
organizations included the 
Thomas Merton Center, Students 
for Peaceful Justice, and Zi (an 
activist organization that offers 
social and political criticism of 
American foreign policy and main
stream media).
In addition, a group of about 30
students organized a support our 
troops rally at the Software 
Engineering Institute which coincid
ed with the peace march. The 
counter-rally was organized by a 
bipartisan coalition of the University 
of Pittsburghs GOP and Democratic 
parties.
Both Democrats and Republicans 
support our President, our troops, 
and our country, said Suneal 
Chandran, a first-year H&SS student 
at Carnegie Mellon who attended the
counter-rally. The Taliban regime 
must be taken out. Afghanistan 
should never again be a base for ter
rorists.
While some believe, like Chadran, 
that war is a justified response to the 
aggression of the Taliban, others are 
not so sure. Our country is founded 
on democratic principles, and that 
means allowing dissent from the 
course the government has chosen to 
take when you feel that it is wrong, 
said Steenhuis.
Online voting raises turnout ten-fold
ELECTIONS, from page A1

Crime and Incident Report
Obscene Language,
11/2/01, 2:15 pm  A staff 
member working in Hamburg Hall 
notified police that an unknown 
female had harassed her. The 
female had walked by the staff 
members open window and 
yelled, Hey Pakistani, we can get 
you people too! The female then 
ran away. The staff member was 
advised to close her window and 
blinds and contact CMU police if 
any further incidents occur.
Medical, 11/3/01, 3:31 am
 Three officers responded to a 
students report of an injured 
male inside a fraternity house. 
Inside the house, the injured male 
was found sitting on a couch, his 
right upper arm severely bruised. 
The victim stated that he had 
been engaged in a punching 
game wherein each contestant 
takes a turn striking the other 
contestant in the arm until one 
quits due to the intense pain. 
CMU EMS treated the victim, who 
refused transport to a hospital.
Theft, 11/4/01, 8:06 pm 
A security guard notified police 
that verbal altercations were esca
lating inside the University Center 
gymnasium. Several officers 
responded and found many indi
viduals leaving the area. Certain 
basketball players accused other 
individuals of going through 
items on the floor while the own
ers were playing basketball. 
Several players accused one male, 
who had already left when the 
police officers arrived, of taking 
wallets and watches. None of the
players were properly signed in, 
though all were wearing wrist
bands. Officers informed them of 
the gymnasiums guest policy. 
Only one victim chose to file a 
theft report.
Fire Alarm Report, 
11/4/01, 8:42 pm  The cam
pus dispatcher received a call 
from a resident advisor concern
ing an oven fire. The responding 
officer found that a student had 
been cooking a steak when the 
steak and grease had caught fire. 
When the officer arrived, the fire 
had been extinguished but the 
smoke was still present. The room 
was vented with a fan.
Suspicious Person,
11/5/01, 8:32 am  An FMS
employee contacted police to 
report a male seen on the rooftop 
of Wean Hall. The male was seen 
standing between heating and 
ventilation units that produce a 
great deal of noise. The employee 
described the actor as wearing 
glasses and a long black coat. 
Police officers found a male 
matching the description of the 
actor in Wean Hall 5328. The FMS 
employee positively identified the 
male as the person seen on the 
roof. The male stated he goes up 
to the roof because its quiet and 
theres a good view. The officer 
gave the actor a verbal warning 
not to go on the roof and 
explained the dangers of being in 
the area.
Medical, 11/6/01, 1:02 am
 Campus police responded to a
call of an injured student in 
Hamerschlag House. The victim 
stated that he had been playing 
with his Swiss Army knife and had 
accidentally lacerated his finger. 
CMU EMS cleaned and bandaged 
the wound. The victim accepted 
transport to the hospital.
Fire Alarm, 11/7/01, 11:05
pm  The fire alarm for the The 
Frame was activated. Two police 
officers responded to the alarm 
and found no fire or smoke. The 
activated detector was located in 
a small room apart from the main 
show area. The room had an art 
project involving two popcorn 
makers making popcorn. The pop
corn makers activated the fire 
alarm. The fire department was 
notified of the false alarm. The 
student in charge of the art pro
ject was advised to contact 
Environment, Health, and Safety 
before running his project again.

SDCs decision to gain student 
input will benefit community
Student Dormitory Councils decision 
to let the students decide how the money 
should be spent, after being faced with a 
$40,000 surplus accumulated over the 
last few years, is a positive step toward 
improving campus living. Although the 
existence of such a surplus calls for bet
ter financial management on the part of 
SDC committees and programs, the 
Council should be commended for its 
attempt to return the money to the 
hands of the students. With the imple
mentation of student suggestions, the 
University is likely to gain much-wanted 
additions that enrich both academic and 
residential life.
Earlier this semester, SDC announced 
it would begin accepting students pro
posals for ways that the surplus could 
be spent. These were narrowed down to 
10, and students were then given the 
opportunity to rank their favorites 
through the SDC Web site. Although 
some students feel the surplus plan was 
insufficiently advertised, over 700 
votes were cast in the span of a week, 
providing the impetus for campus 
changes to get underway.
Ranging from improvements as 
minor as adding charcoal grills to dor
mitories on the Hill (Scobell, 
Henderson, Boss/McGill) to fencing in 
the courtyard between Morewood A 
and D-towers and making it accessible 
from the B and C-tower doors, SDCs 
surplus certainly has the potential to 
benefit students living in residence 
halls. However, other proposals aim to
enrich the campus as a whole  such as 
creating a lounge on University 
grounds for students living off campus, 
or adding clocks to Kirr Commons in 
the UC. Finally, some proposals  like 
making CFA performances free or 
reduced to students, bringing a Dance 
Dance Revolution Machine to CMU, or 
aiding in funding the Meeting of the 
Minds 2002  focus on the arts and 
entertainment, and would greatly 
enhance the sense of community 
among students.
SDC has taken a great first step 
toward improved University living by 
letting the students have a say in sur
plus spending. Now that their voices 
have been heard, its imperative that 
SDC work alongside the administration
 and other organizations, if necessary
 to put these proposals into practice. 
If, as speculated, SDC chooses to use 
part of its surplus to match September 
11-related donations collected through 
campus groups such as APhiO, the 
money should be carefully regulated to 
ensure it truly helps people in need. 
With so many excellent outlets for the 
surplus available, Student Dormitory 
Council should make every possible 
attempt to distribute the funds in a way 
that benefits a majority of the campus 
community. Continued encouragement 
of student input and clear communica
tion between SDC and the student body 
is a necessary second step in the 
process of putting the surplus to use on 
the Carnegie Mellon campus.
Pitt should focus on students, not 
succumb to political pressures
Over the past few months, the 
University of Pittsburgh has turned their 
backs on the Environmental Law Clinic 
(ELC), a program within Pitts School of 
Law. The ELC first accepted students to 
the program in January 2001, and 
assists clients who are involved in actual 
environmental disputes. These clients 
often lack legal representation beyond 
that provided by the ELC. The state leg
islature, Pitt officials, and businesses are 
combining their efforts to shut down the 
ELC for assisting with controversial 
cases. This suppression of academic free
dom is a slap in the face of higher educa
tion, and an ominous precedent for the 
University of Pittsburgh.
The ELC is under criticism, in particu
lar for defending the interests of the 
Allegheny National Forest and support
ing a group opposed to the Mon-Fayette 
Expressway. The ELC, which receives its 
entire current annual budget of 
$107,000 from a Heinz Foundation 
grant, was first told it could not 
approach Heinz for any further funds. 
Last month, Pitt charged the ELC over 
$60,000 for administrative and over
head fees, expenses not charged to sim
ilar departments within the school. 
Withdrawing these funds places the ELC 
in jeopardy of being shut down. Last 
week, Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg 
released a seven page letter to the

University community about a variety of 
topics, and finished the letter with over 
two pages of criticism for the ELC.
Not only is the Chancellors delivery in 
poor taste, his message is an abuse of the 
authority given to him by the University 
of Pittsburgh. While he can compose a 
letter to the entire campus, the ELC has 
no such methods with which to defend 
themselves. Chancellor Nordenberg has 
succumbed to financial and political 
pressure placed on him by the logging 
industry and the legislators of north
western Pennsylvania. He should con
centrate more on Pitts ability to provide 
a diverse and meaningful education 
than on these outside interests.
The ELC offers an educational cur
riculum not available at other schools 
in the region and should not be forced 
to separate from the University of 
Pittsburgh. It is an asset to the School of 
Law at Pitt that should not be cast out 
for championing a mission that is 
unpopular with industry or legislators 
in northwestern Pennsylvania.
Pitts law school currently has a 
strong academic reputation. However, 
the decision to cast out the ELC has tar
nished this reputation in the eyes of stu
dents, alumni, and the Pittsburgh com
munity. Pitt Law can no longer be 
counted on to provide an open-minded 
and diverse education.
Immigration issues
Editors:
Thank you for your attention to the 
issue of student visas on The Tartans 
November 5 front page. Staffwriter 
Bubna raised many important issues and 
provided some valuable information.
The Office of International 
Education (OIE) is responsible for issu
ing 1-20 documents and supports the 
Universitys 1980 international stu
dents and 400 ^visiting scholars in 
issues related to visas, foreign travel, 
and cross cultural matters. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, our 
staff has closely monitored proposed 
legislation which may impact interna
tional students. We are in regular con
tact with the international student 
population to keep them apprised of 
relevant issues.
OIE would like to clarify one point of 
the recent article regarding the propos
als by Senator Feinstein and more 
recently by Senators Feinstein and Kyi 
(S1627). In the immediate aftermath 
of the events on September 11, 
Feinstein did propose a six-month 
moratorium on the issuance of all stu
dent visas. It is important to note, 
however, that Senator Feinstein has 
since retracted that proposal and there 
is no indication that this idea will 
move forward.
Many of the other issues mentioned 
in your article are either part of the 
USA PATRIOT Act which was signed 
into law by President Bush on October 
26, 2001, or part of the Feinstein/Kyl 
(S1627) and Kennedy/Brownback 
(S1618) legislative proposals neither of 
which has passed into law. We encour
age students, particularly those who 
might be directly impacted, to visit rel
evant legislative Web sites and to 
understand the US legislative process 
so as not to feel unnecessarily alarmed. 
Two helpful sites with up-to-date, accu
rate information are http://www.nafsa.org 
and www.thomas.loc.gov.
OIE is concerned about these issues 
and the potential impact on our cam
pus community. We will continue our 
efforts to ensure that international 
students and scholars are informed 
of changes to immigration law 
and practice.

Inappropriate info
Editors:
As an alumnus of both Carnegie 
Mellon and The Tartan, I was disturbed 
this week to pick up the newspaper and
Erica DiBenedetto/Art Editor
find an ad from CODOH, which is 
apparently now hiding behind an 
acronym instead of its real name, 
Committee for Open Debate on 
the Holocaust.
This organization is run by Bradley 
R. Smith, one of the most notorious 
Holocaust deniers and considered by 
many a neo-Nazi and an anti-Semite. At 
the very least, he is a self-proclaimed 
historian who rarely allows facts to 
get in the way of his history. Among 
other theories advanced by Mr. Smith 
and his colleagues, the US Army Signal 
Corps faked films of the Nazi concen
tration camps, that witnesses to Nazi 
tortures are liars or delusionary, 
and that no Jews were knowingly killed 
by the Germans.
While I appreciate the need for open 
debate and dissemination of unpopular 
opinions, I view Mr. Smiths advertis
ing as I would the advertising of any 
defective or dangerous product. Mr. 
Smith is selling an item that is harm
ful to consumers and provably wrong.
I would hope that in the future, The 
Tartan will decline advertising from 
Mr. Smith, and thus consign his prod
uct to the same shelf as the water 
engine, the perpetual motion machine, 
and the Flat Earth Society map.

Making work worthwhile:Why CMU needs a Universal Living Wage
LaRita Y. Hamilton
Attention Princeton Review: Carnegie 
Mellon is not as apathetic as you think. 
Someone should send them pictures of 
Thursday nights packed Kresge Theater. 
Speaker William Upski Wimsatt had kids 
spilling into the aisle to hear him speak. 
And how did he get here? Some kids read 
his book and decided that he was the 
kind of person who needed to come to 
our campus and they made it happen. 
Hows that for apathy?
Carnegie Mellon has a lot to offer. We 
have a great business school, we have a 
great drama department, hell, CMU 
even has a juggling club and our very 
own unicycle boy. It recently came to 
my attention, though, that CMU does 
not have a Universal Living Wage policy.
What the hell is the Universal Living 
Wage (ULW) and why should we care? 
Were all going to graduate and get 
great jobs with companies like Oracle 
and Microsoft, right? Lets discuss:
The ULW formula is based on the 
premise that if a person works 40 hours 
a week, they should be able to access 
basic housing wherever he/she may 
live. The formula consists of two feder
al guidelines, the first using the HUD 
standard that no more than 30 percent 
of a persons gross monthly income 
should be spent on housing. The sec
ond guideline is the Fair Market Rents 
(FMRs) that are established by HUD 
for each municipality and surround
ing areas each year. The ULW varies 
from area to area in accordance with 
the FMR.
By the ULW formula, for a person to 
spend 30 percent of their total income 
on an efficiency apartment, they would 
have to make $7.48/hour, not the fed
eral minimum wage of $5.15/hour. 
About 11.8 million workers are affect
ed by the federal minimum wage. Its 
easy to assume that most of the people 
working for minimum wage are 
teenagers working part time jobs, but 
according to the Economic Policy 
Institute, teenagers account for only 
seven percent of the total minimum 
wage work force. Forty percent of 
those in the 11.8 million minimum 
wage work force are the sole provider 
for their household.
What does this have to do with CMU? 
The University doesnt run itself. It 
relies on a vast network of faculty and 
staff members, who I believe, deserve 
just as much of a chance of a good life 
as the students that have come here to 
learn. Diversity  cultural, economi
cal, political  is a major concern of 
the University. In the past few years,
diate implementation of this policy 
affect all Carnegie Mellon staff mem
bers? The answer is no. Carnegie 
Mellon would need to bring all janitor
ial and dining service work back inhouse. By discontinuing the policy of 
out-sourcing, the University would be 
able to insure that all staff members 
had the same benefits rather than 
being able to deny responsibility for 
negative worker experiences. I believe 
that the overall result would be higher 
staff morale and a higher retention rate 
of workers.
I wont lie, I hadnt even heard of the 
ULW until about a month ago. I attend
ed the diversity conference sponsored 
by Student Affairs and participated in a 
small discussion with Professor Kathy 
Newman concerning labor relations on 
campus. Before coming to Carnegie 
Mellon, Newman was active in the
It's time we got involved in this deeply 
profound way.... I have heard, repeatedly, 
that Carnegie Mellon has one of the best 
faculty and staff benefits policies of all the 
universities in the area. So whats wrong 
with one of the best getting better?
there has been great opportunity for 
dialogue about such issues. For this 
reason, I think this is the perfect time 
to address this issue. The University 
has proven time and time again that it 
cares, so lets care a little bit more.
By implementing a ULW policy, CMU 
would not only be improving the lives 
of Carnegie Mellon workers, it would 
set an important precedent for univer
sities across the county. A question I 
had to ask myself was: Would an immefight for a ULW at two prominent uni
versities. The idea, to me, made so 
much sense. Campus morale extends 
beyond the students. It means that the 
faculty and staff need to feel appreciat
ed and that they feel like an integral 
part of the community. How can a staff 
member feel like a part of the campus 
community when their needs are not 
considered as important as the needs 
of others?

I had an argument the other day with 
one of my friends because he said rock 
advocated drugs. It was a little more than 
an argument for me because I guess for me, 
rock took on a metaphor for freedom. In 
saying so, I guess my definition of rock dif
fers too. Theres a lot more to it than the 
instruments that are used and how theyre 
used. Rock was about voicing ones opinion 
... about screaming it out and seeing how it 
felt. It was about saying something 
because it had to be said. It is true, I must 
add, that a lot of the music of the 60s and 
70s was an ode to drugs. Songs like Bob 
Dylans Tambourine Man and Hendrixs 
Purple Haze show this only too well. But 
understand that rock wasnt asking you to 
do drugs, but was instead asking you to get
high on your freedom. I use terms like 
was and felt because with great disap
pointment I must say rock is dead, and I am 
here to deliver its eulogy.
How was rock born? Some say from 
rebellion, some say from want of peace. 
For me, it was more from a whole new 
generation who wanted to question 
things, who werent scared to express 
what they felt, and their music was their 
deepest expression of this. And so, rock 
mirrored a whole eras evolution. Even 
though it might seem contradictory, this is 
precisely the reason why rock will be for
ever relevant. Rock represented the 
process the era went through more than 
the era itself. People will always question 
present social norms, and so will rock. 
More importantly, people will always 
question the meaning of life and so will 
rock. Who today can match the eclectic 
poet Jim Morrison or groups like Led 
Zeppelin who wrote lyrics and songs 
because of their love of music, and not
because they wanted to be popular. Will 
we ever get to see lyrics as impressive and 
deep as The End by Morrison again? 
Even if we take songs that werent neces
sarily philosophical, but just about having 
a good time ... they still had meaning and 
soul. Listen to groups like Creedance 
Clearwater Revival and the Rolling Stones 
and youll know what I mean. How people 
can appreciate songs like Oops ... I Did it 
Again or idolize bands filled with boys 
who dont know how to sing and seriously 
need to question their sexuality, is com
pletely beyond me. One of the greatest 
mysteries to me is how Britney Spears has 
managed to top the charts for the last four 
years, her only claim to fame being her 
endowments and her supposed virginity. 
What comes out from people like her, the 
Backstreet Boys, NSync, etc. is definitely 
not music. People might retort by saying 
that its a different kind of music that 
must be appreciated, Im sorry, the only 
skill these people have is knowng how to
sell themselves. Music is not about how 
good-looking you are.
Last weekend I went to the U2 concert 
in Philadelphia. It was easily one of the 
best experiences Ive ever had, but some
thing hit me. The only songs that actually 
moved me were their old ones. Theyre 
desperately trying to hold on to what they 
had. They are one of my favorite bands, 
they still are ... Im just praying they dont 
sell out. Maybe music hasnt really died 
yet ... maybe there is still some hope. 
There are still real musicians like U2, 
Matchbox 20, and Red Hot Chili Peppers 
around. Meanwhile, let this article be 
more of an appeal to people to stop giving 
the boys and girls with electronically 
altered voices and fake bodies with fake 
smiles what they dont deserve ... the title 
of Musicians.

Gut with the old, in with the new: US moves to replace alliances
David M. Anderson
World War Two officially ended this past 
Friday. The Japanese Navy has left port in 
order to conduct combat and combat sup
port operations in the Northern Arabian 
Sea. One set of alliances and combinations 
have replaced another set of alliances and 
combinations against a different foe. We 
need to remember that different nations 
look to join collective actions and interna
tional groups for different reasons. This 
motivational difference is apparent even 
today in the war against Afghanistan and 
the global campaign against terrorism 
(which, by the definition of terrorism, 
will fail).
Great Britains Prime Minister Tony 
Blair has offered almost unconditional 
support to the United States. Within an 
hour of being notified of the attacks 
against the World Trade Centers and the 
Pentagon, he was on television announc
ing that the United Kingdom stood shoul
der to shoulder with the United States. 
Some American analyses just proclaimed 
that this is the continuation of the special 
relationship that has existed between the 
United States and the United Kingdom 
since the late 19th century. This is too 
shallow of an analysis. If one listens to the 
language that Blair uses, we see that his 
motivation is that of Wilsonian interna
tionalist idealist. He honestly believes that 
there exists a community of nations that, 
when provided with good means of com
munication, can provide for the common 
peace and welfare of the world. I happen 
to have faith in this vision, but it stands in 
stark contrast to the power-centered 
rhetoric and unilateralist actions that 
seem to have marked, previous to 
September 11, the foreign policy advisors 
to President Bush.
Great Britain is not the only nation to 
have offered significant amounts of sup
port to the United States. I believe that we 
can divide Americas allies, friends, 
enablers, and co-belligerents into four dif
ferent categories of motivation. Some
nations will fall under more than one cat
egory; for example, Turkey has both his
torical and immediately selfish motives to 
aid the United States. These definitions 
are rough and pliable, but I think that they
like the status-quo. These nations also 
have had very long, cordial relationships 
with the United States. Aiding the United 
States to eliminate the threat to the bene
ficial status quo is in these nations best

are superior to the good vs. evil and 
black and white definitions and visions 
of the world offered by President Bush.
Great Britain, Canada, the rest of NATO, 
including Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, 
and Japan form the basis of the first group 
of allies. These nations share several 
important characteristics. The most obvi
ous is that all of these nations are rich and 
satisfied with the world in general. They

interests. There is also the prospect of a 
shadow of the past and the future; the 
United States has aided these nations dur
ing dark days, and may do so in the future 
if there is a historical debt.
The second group of nations which are 
either aiding the United States, or at least 
not interfering, is a much smaller group. 
The Russian Federation and the Peoples 
Republic of China have supported the 
United States for their own, transactional 
reasons. Russia has had a long history of 
problems with militant Wahhabi Muslim 
insurgents; the most notable case is in 
Chechnya. Russia wants to be able to inte
grate its economy into the Western world 
while also being able to achieve secure 
borders and no more dissolution of feder
al control. By allowing the United States 
to use its airspace and allowing the United 
States to base troops and aircraft in the 
former Soviet Republic, Russia is hoping 
to gain a freer hand in Chechnya and some 
form of economic quid pro quo. China also 
has a fundamentalist separatist problem 
in Xianyang province for which they 
would like to be able to operate against 
without worrying about human rights 
criticism from the United States. However, 
their support has been significantly less 
than that given by Russia. Chinas motiva
tion is mainly commercial, it needs to sup
port the United States to avoid a grass
roots boycott, but at the same time, sup
port has been limited because China has a 
long historical opposition to foreign inter
vention in nations surrounding its bor
ders. It fears encirclement.
The third group of nations that are aiding 
the United States are those that see that they 
can gain improved ties to the US, act against 
a local problem, make money, and royally 
honk off a local rival. Iran and India are the 
most prominent of this group that also 
includes Egypt. Iran has had a long standing 
dispute with the Taliban over numerous 
issues, including the

SAY WHAT?
This weeks guest writer-. 
Ari Heitner
Set the facts straight about Israel
There has been a lot of discussion of current 
events in Israel since the Palestinian Intifada start
ed a year and two months ago. This debate has 
intensified following the terrorist attacks of 
September 11.
The natural desire to sympathize with oppressed 
people has led to a dangerous tendency among 
some liberal thinkers to unquestioningly believe 
Arab propaganda about the plight of Palestinian 
Arabs, to justify acts of terror in response to per
ceived oppression, and finally to justify the horrific 
acts of September 11 as an appropriate retort to socalled American imperialism.
In an atmosphere of total moral relativism, if we 
cant agree on a starting point, well just be talking 
past each other. Any side can justify anything based 
only on how strongly it feels about an issue.
Before any discussion on the conflict in Israel, 
some facts must be accepted:
 Terrorism is a deliberate attack on civilians for 
a political purpose. It doesnt matter who the 
attacker is, who the victim is, or what the goal is. 
Terrorism is wrong, under all circumstances.
Suicide-bombing a crowded pizza shop is terror. 
Hijacking airplanes is terror. Mailing letters laced 
with anthrax is terror. Assassinating democratical
ly elected government ministers is terror.
Targeted killings of known criminals who have
The UN is not an 
impartial organization.
UN Secretary General Kofi 
Annan recently admitted 
that the UN was guilty of 
lying to Israel and withhold
ing information about 
Israeli soldiers abducted 
from Israeli territory.
been indicted for past crimes, have escaped from 
revolving-door prisons, and who are engaged in 
planning new attacks is not terror. Bombing mili
tary targets is not terror.
Civilian deaths as a result of military action are a 
terrible tragedy. They may lead to questioning 
whether the military goals are worth their civilian 
price. But there can be no moral equivalence 
between military actions and terrorism.
 Israel is a democracy. Its political system repre
sents a multitude of views. There are Arab political 
parties, and Arab members of Parliament. The 
Basic Law, Israel's Constitution, states There shall 
be no violation of the life, body or dignity of any 
person as such. There shall be no violation of the 
property of a person. All persons are entitled to 
protection of their life, body and dignity. Israel is 
not a perfect society; any resident who wishes to 
protest its policies is free to do so in a peaceful 
manner. Israel has an active and vocal free press.
Egypt and Syria are not democracies. They are 
dictatorship/oligarchies with long records of 
quashing dissident political views. Lebanon is a 
puppet state of Syria; there are 30,000 Syrian
troops in Lebanon, and the Lebanese government 
has repeatedly ignored calls to curb the Syrianbacked Hizbullah terrorists.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) is not a democra
cy. It has repeatedly suppressed political opposi
tion and both internal and foreign press.
 The UN is not an impartial organization. UN 
Secretary General Kofi Annan recently admitted 
that the UN was guilty of lying to Israel and with
holding information about Israeli soldiers abduct
ed from Israeli territory by Hizbullah terrorists 
masquerading as UN peacekeepers. Syria, a nation 
which the US considers a supporter of terrorism, 
has been elected to the Security Council of the UN.
Whatever accusations of war crimes one may 
wish to bring against Israeli  or American  
leaders, the UN is not an appropriate body to 
try those cases.
 The Jewish people have a historical claim to 
Israel, as documented by the archaeological 
record. It starts 3,000 years ago at the time of King 
David. Yehuda and Shomron, the modern day West 
Bank, formed the core of the Davidic kingdom. 
Israel was a sovereign Jewish state continuously for 
1,000 years, with the exception of the Babylonian 
exile from 586 to 516 BCE. The current plaza con
taining the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosques 
is the foundation of the final renovation of the 
Temple, built by King Herod. In the year 70 CE, 
Jewish rule over Israel ended when Roman legions 
sacked Jerusalem and razed the Temple. While 
many Jews went into exile, a Jewish presence has 
remained in Jerusalem and around the country 
from that time until the present.
Islam began in 622 CE, 1,600 years after the 
beginning of the Davidic dynasty. Over the next 
1,300 years, Israel was controlled by various sul
tanates  first the Abbassids, then the 
Ommayyads, then the Mamelukes, and finally the 
Ottoman Turks. The Dome of the Rock, the third 
holiest site in Islam, was built in the seventh centu
ry. From the time Rome took direct control of Israel 
in 70 CE, until the founding of the modern state in 
1948, there has been no independent state, Arab or 
Jewish, in Israel.
No one is denying the Arab claim to Israel.
In numerous statements, Arafat and his advisors 
have dei\ied the Jewish connection to Temple 
Mount, Jerusalem and Israel.
Finally, a personal observation drawn from visits 
to Israel two summers ago, and again this past sum
mer: Most Israelis supported the peace process 
going into the Camp David talks. They accepted the 
reality of an eventual Palestinian state. But they 
saw the PA leave Camp David without compromis
ing its positions. It proceeded to incite violence, 
and released known terrorists from jail. It has 
repeatedly paid lip service to condemning terror in 
the Western press, while dragging its feet on arrest
ing terrorists. After more than a year of horrific 
attacks against every facet of Israeli society, Israelis 
have come to believe what the Right has been say
ing for years: Arabs in general, and the PA in par
ticular, want nothing less than the destruction of 
the Israeli state. In August of 2000, the PA could 
have concluded a very favorable final-status treaty. 
Its not clear Israel will give them that opportunity 
again.

Time for some change:
Give CMU workers what they deserve
HAMILTON, from page A6
Some may say that the best index for a national 
minimum wage is the Federal Poverty Guideline. 
The Federal Poverty Guideline is based on the per
centage of a familys budget that is made up of 
food. Food makes up about 16 percent of a familys 
budget, while housing makes up 37 percent of a 
familys budget. The ULW gives local governments 
the ability to customize wages using guidelines 
established by the Federal government. FMRs are 
re-examined on a yearly basis. The ULW would 
automatically be adjusted up or down depending 
on economic need.
Increasing minimum wages would not harm local 
economy by inflating prices. Conversely, it would 
be energized by injecting new funds. That would be 
a good thing, because then people would be able to 
keep up with the rising costs of Pirates tickets.
Carnegie Mellons community involvement is 
commendable, but I think its time we got involved 
is this deeply profound way. This kind of campus 
should be the kind of place where everyone wants 
to work. I have heard, repeatedly, that Carnegie
Mellon has one of the best faculty and staff benefits 
policies of all the universities in the area. So whats 
wrong with one of the best getting better?
Aside from making CMU a better place, Id like to 
know that if I didnt get one of those great jobs at 
Oracle, which probably wont happen since Im a 
creative writing major, I would be able to become a 
staff member at CMU and be able to make a fair 
wage. And if I did get a job at Oracle, Id hope that 
every staff member was making a fair wage.
The extension of community to everyone at 
Carnegie Mellon is extremely important in main
taining a dynamic campus climate. I think its great 
that were seeing a surge of activism on this campus 
and Id like to encourage students to look into this. 
We can boycott sweatshops thousands of miles 
away and improve life on campus at the same time.

O-bnoxious:
Sometimes bad food only gets worse
Pratik Agarwal
People often regard food qual
ity as being a major issue when it 
comes to dining at CMU, but 
what they often fail to see is the 
more basic problem that exists
 service. To be fair, most loca
tions on campus can pass as 
decent, but when it comes to the 
O, I sometimes wonder what 
good it actually has to offer. For 
starters they have an extremely 
limited variety of food, out of 
which, a lot of items are usually 
not available. The only thing 
that the place seems to have 
going for it, probably in excess, 
is oil  since most of the food 
seems to be dripping in it. To top 
things off, the attitude of the 
workers just seems so ridiculous 
that it is inexplicable. Having 
experienced some very unac
ceptable behavior on more than 
one occasion and having even 
watched a girl being made to 
cry, I felt compelled to write an 
article expressing the frustration 
of many.
In contrast to the ladies work
ing at the International Market, 
who I believe are some of the 
nicest people around, the work
ers at the O seem as if they 
have never heard of being 
polite. That word just seems to 
be missing from their not very 
inspiring vocabulary. I had 
repeatedly noticed them spit
ting out insults and behaving in 
a rude manner, all of which I 
tolerated, but after an incident 
with the head guy  who can 
best be described as an arrogant 
bastard  I lost my cool. 
Initially I ignored him, consider
ing him to just be an ignorant 
fool, who had nothing better in 
his life than to stand in front of 
the counter and remove his frus
tration. Till then I believed in 
the saying, Ignorance is bliss, 
and so relented by thinking that 
the man had no clue of what he 
was unintentionally doing. As 
usual, one night, my order took 
a long while to be made and so I 
went up to the counter to see if 
it was done. And as expected, I 
was received with a grumpy face 
and a rude What! Ignoring 
this I gave him my order number 
and asked if it was ready, to
which he replied, I didnt ask 
you for your number. Well, it 
turned out that my order had 
been thrown away, for some rea
son completely beyond me, 
without my number even being 
called. Naturally I was mystified 
but didnt spend long arguing, 
since I didnt even expect an 
apology, let alone my burger. 
But when I was leaving he 
passed the most ironic com
ment, saying ...and these guys 
think theyre being discriminat
ed upon! That got me thinking. 
If he was cheeky enough to say 
that, he was obviously aware of 
what he had been doing all 
along, and had on his own, 
answered the reason for 
his indifference.
I dont know the reason for 
such absurd behavior  perhaps 
it could be a frustrated sex life  
but in no way does it give him a 
right to vent his dissatisfaction 
on us. All I can say is that his 
mindset makes him a sadist and 
someone who I can only pity.

Out with old, in with new (alliances)
ANDERSON, from page A7 
murder of Iranian diplomats, reli
gious disagreements, and trade 
disputes.
Iran has also had poor relations 
with the United States since 1979. 
However, they have improved over 
the past five years although there 
are no official ambassadorial ties 
as of yet. Iran has offered to close 
the Afghani border, aid refugees, 
arm the opposition, and conduct 
search and rescue operations for 
any coalition pilots that have been 
shot down. Iran hopes that these 
actions will bring closer commer
cial and diplomatic ties with the 
United States while also removing 
a problem in Afghanistan. India 
has a similar motivation: to 
improve commercial ties, to coun
terbalance Pakistan and China, 
and to eliminate the support net
work for Muslim insurgents in 
Kashmir. Again, India was one of 
the first countries to offer basing 
and refueling rights to the United 
States after September 11.
Turkey also belongs in this 
group, for they have always been 
in, but not all the way in, the club 
of closest compatriots with the 
United States. Turkey has been a 
long time ally, a NATO member 
since 1952, and since 1947, the 
scene of a large American military 
presence. Turkey was a critical 
coalition partner in the Second 
Gulf War, and has allowed the 
United States and Great Britain to 
patrol the northern no-fly zone 
for the past 10 years. However, 
the United States, in response to 
Turkish-Greek tensions and con
flicts over both Cyprus and 
Aegean Sea mineral rights as well 
as Turkish treatment towards 
their Kurdish population and 
unstable governments, has been 
reluctant at times to fully 
embrace Turkey. Turkish support 
to the United States at this time
serves many purposes: to protect 
the status quo, to gain a freer 
hand against Kurdish separatists, 
to improve ties, to improve 
Turkeys chances at getting into 
the European Union and other 
causes. For these reasons, in addi
tion to maintaining a historical 
alliance, Turkey has been the 
strongest ally to the United States 
in the Muslim world.
The final group of nations that 
are aiding the United States are 
those that got arm-twisted into 
it. Saudi Arabia, most of the 
Arab world and Pakistan fall 
under this category. Internal 
domestic considerations would 
prompt most of the rulers to not 
support the United States unless 
one hell of a huge stick was used
as much as possible instead of 
getting crushed. These nations 
are fairly unwilling members of 
a coalition against Afghanistan 
and Al-quaida, but they can and 
have been bought for long 
enough.
I have gone on for so long 
about the different motivations 
of the different countries that 
are aiding the United States, 
because I think that we need to 
realize that the world is not 
black and white. Our president 
loves false dichotomies and nonanalytical thinking when he 
speaks and when he acts. If we 
are to assume that those who are

Delivering Great Taste
THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 12, 2001
Messiah Falcons defeat Carnegie \ 
Mellon men at NCAA tournament
to his left on a shot from 15 yards 
out, a Falcon player lobbed a gentle 
shot that somehow made its way 
over Doughterys reaching finger
tips, and on towards the goal. As 
he turned to watch the path of the 
ball, it hit the lower part of the 
upper post and bounced on the 
ground again on the verge of enter
ing the goal. Dougherty quickly 
nabbed the ball and returned it to 
play.
Later, with 7:45 remaining in the 
overtime, and the game on the line 
with sudden-death in effect, 
Messiah had two good scoring 
opportunities, but blew them both.
The first came off of a cross on 
the right side, which was headed 
right towards the lower left corner, 
but was deflected by Dougherty. 
Messiah recovered, sent a cross 
from the left side this time, and 
another header was shot wide.
Through all this drama, the 
crowd reacted with every call, 
every play, and every near-score. 
At one point, when the game 
became frustratingly physical, and 
no calls were being made, a Tartan 
player threw and missed a punch 
after being tangled up with a 
Falcon midfielder at the center 
line.
The crowd jeered at the referees, j 
and at one point some Messiah fan I 
screamed at a referee, You related 
to number eight? Is he your broth
er?
Despite the overwhelming 
Messiah support from the crowd, 
Dougherty said there was an injec
tion of energy, something that is 
lacking at home games in Gesling 
Stadium.
It is great to play in front of a 
crowd like that, he said. It just { 
makes the game more exciting.
But there was a more important I 
presence at that game, and all the 
Tartans games: head coach Nick 
Gaudioso. He puts in a lot of work 
off the field that people dont see, 
and doesnt receive the credit he 
deserves, said Dougherty. Hes 
done a lot for the three seniors that 
has made all the difference for us in 
our experience at CMU.
With the season past, the players 
may harbor hints of bitterness, but 
know they gave it their all.
While Im frustrated now, 
Dougherty said, I cant really look 
back with any regrets. We left it all 
on the field and earned a lot of 
respect. We gained respect from 
Messiah on Friday, and have noth
ing to be ashamed of.
NCAA, from page A12 
yielded a painful, and much closer, 
result. No one would deny that it 
was a crowd-pleaser.
Moving up and down the field, 
the players legs blurred, and they 
played physically, making hard 
tackles on defense and protecting 
possessions with reckless abandon.
For the most part, Messiah was 
on the offensive more often than 
Carnegie Mellon, but the stingy 
defenses were key  as was a little 
bit of luck.
With 31 minutes remaining in 
regulation, the Falcons threw in 
from the right sideline at the 
Tartans goal. The ball was headed 
tv/ice.
In the scramble for the ball in the 
crease, Dougherty was taken out, 
and the goal was left open. The 
ball bounced harmlessly on the 
ground after the second header, 
and lazily headed for the goal A 
Tartan defender raced towards the 
net, attempting to clear the ball, 
and nearly missed. His volley 
angled off the top of his foot and hit 
the upper goalpost, but was ulti
mately cleared.
With 24 minutes remaining in 
regulation, and only 30 seconds 
after Dougherty made a diving save

Cards Mark McGwire to retire
BRISTOL, CT (AP)  Mark 
McGwire, the former single-season 
home run king, told ESPN that he 
is worn out and will retire from 
baseball.
McGwire strongly hinted of 
retiring several times this year, 
when he batted just .187 with 29 
home runs as he was slowed by a 
bum right knee.
ESPN anchor Rich Eisen said he 
received a telephone call from 
McGwire on Sunday night and the 
slugger said that he was extreme
ly happy with the decision. 
McGwire had agreed to a $30 
million, two-year contract exten
sion in spring training but never 
signed the deal.
After considerable discussion 
with those closest to me, I have
decided not to sign the extension, 
as I am unable to perform at a level 
equal to the salary the organiza
tion would be paying me, 
McGwire said in a statement to 
ESPN. I believe I owe it to the 
Cardinals and the fans of St. Louis 
to step aside, so a talented free 
agent can be brought in as the final 
piece of what I expect can be a 
World Championship-caliber 
team.
McGwire captured the nations 
imagination in 1998 while hitting 
70 homers to break Roger Maris 
37-year-old record. It was a short
lived mark as Barry Bonds hit 73 
homers this season.
McGwire has 583 career home 
runs, fifth on the career list, and 
finished his career 17 shy of
becoming the fourth player to hit 
600 homers.
McGwire, who began his career 
with Oakland in 1986, won the 
World Series with the As in 1989 
and reached the postseason six 
times.
For years I have said my motiva
tion for playing wasnt for fame 
and fortune, but rather the love of 
competing, McGwire said in the 
statement. Baseball is a team 
sport and I have been lucky 
enough to contribute to the suc
cess of some great teams.
He labored through the 2000 
season with a bad right knee, miss
ing virtually all of the second half. 
He had surgery to correct patella 
tendinitis but again struggled with 
the knee this season.

Womens soccer completes Swim teams fare well against conference foes
season, makes ECAC finals
SOCCER, from page A12 
Kendra said this team was the 
strongest shes coached, and cred
its the ability of the women to per
form as a team.
The team has gone through 
subtle changes each year Ive been 
here, she said. We played 
together well, and that was the 
main difference this season.
I think our ability to play with 
heart, confidence, and coopera
tion led to our numerous victo
ries, said McConnochie. There 
are a lot of good teams out there 
with good players, but not every
one succeeds.
Kendra notes that without her 
assistant coaches, that cohesive
ness wouldnt be as strong as it has 
been this season.
I work with oustanding coach
es and athletic trainers, she said, 
in reference to her defense assis
tant Judy Deer, goalkeeping assis
tant Deb Yost, and other members 
of her staff. It is wonderful to 
trust your other coaches. I feel 
extremely fortunate to have three 
assistant coaches.
It seems the Tartans have 
nowhere to go but up, considering 
their sizable improvement over 
last season. But the team will be 
losing three starting seniors, 
Snell, back Melanie Stawartz, and 
midfielder Ashley Wermine, each 
of whom were vital to the Tartans 
run this season, said Kendra.
Itll be tough to lose them, she 
said.
While the women will miss
playing together competitively, 
the season is over, and they also 
welcome the rest they will be get
ting.
Kendra will turn her attention 
to recruiting, and filling in some 
of the gaps left by departing 
seniors. But make no mistake  
theyve all got their eyes on having 
a strong fall 2002, even though 
this season just ended.
We have a large number of tal
ented players returning, said 
Kendra. Im very excited for next 
season.
The freshmen this year were a 
great addition to the team, and I 
know they will be a big part of the 
teams success in the future, said 
Snell. Weve got two strong goal
keepers and the two best center 
midfielders in the conference, 
who will be returning next year, so 
I know the team will do well.
What cannot be overlooked is 
the womens unity as friends and 
teammates.
Ill really miss playing with my 
teammates, said Snell. Ive 
known a lot of these girls for sev
eral years and it will be hard to 
leave.
McConnochie, who had strug
gled this past season because of 
her health, said her teammates 
were always there for her.
I can honestly say that I would 
feel comfortable going to any per
son on the team for advice or 
help, she said. I cant say that 
about any other team that Ive 
been on.

With the new talent the Tartans have in their first-year class, their diving performance is no longer up in the air.
SWIM, from page A12
plete meet  he started and ended
great.
McCarthy wasnt the only mem
ber of the team to have a good 
weekend, of course. First-year 
Chris Pearson had a strong show
ing himself, winning his first event, 
the 1650 meter freestyle, and earn
ing a B cut in the event.
Chris had a very good meet, 
said Belowich. He also had one of 
the best swims of his life.
The women, while unable to put
up the numbers that some of the 
men did, still showed up strong and 
recorded a strong third place over
all finish, coming in not far behind 
second-place Johns Hopkins, and 
ahead of conference rival Case 
Western.
One of the most impressive 
showings of the weekend was by 
first-year Mindi Finnegan, who tied 
for first in the one meter dive and 
took first outright  in the three 
meter dive. Furthermore, 
Finnegans score of 413.55 points 
in the three meter dive qualifies her 
for national competition at the end 
of the season.
Said Belowich, Mindis very tal
ented. To do this well her first year, 
and only after a couple months, is 
just amazing.
Still, while the women didnt 
make much of a dent on the scoresheet, it was the intangibles they 
displayed that mark them as a team 
on the rise. Led by a strong core of 
veteran swimmers, and bolstered 
by their new young talent, the 
womens squad has dramatically 
improved since last season, and 
should be a threat in the near 
future.
The Tartans next action is this 
upcoming Saturday, when they 
head to Case Western to face off 
against their conference rival. 
Given their strong performance 
against the Spartans this weekend, 
both the mens and womens 
squads are looking forward to the 
meet, and consider it an opportuni
ty to prepare for the real competi
tion awaiting them in the weeks to 
come.
This [meet] is an opportunity 
for us to tune up for the dual meets 
we have after Thanksgiving, said 
Belowich. Were looking forward 
to it.

Volleyball 
falls in NCAA) i  jplayoffs
After another successful season 
and second-place finish in the 
UAA championship, the volleyball 
team headed to Mount St. Joseph 
College in Cincinnati to take part 
in the NCAA Division III playoffs.
The trip marked the first time 
that a CMU volleyball team had 
qualified for the national champi
onships, and they were deter
mined not to disappoint.
Indeed, the Tartans came out 
strong in the first round against 
Calvin College, easily sweeping 
the match in three games.
As always, the Tartans were led 
by senior Sara Lechleitner and 
junior Lauren Schmidt, who, as a 
pair, have'spent most of the last 
three seasons terrorizing their 
opponents.
In their first round match, 
Lechleitner managed eight kills 
with two misses in 19 attempts. 
Schmidt, named UAA player of 
the year earlier this month, 
amassed 19 kills by herself, miss
ing only 6 of her 38 tries.
Adding to her already impres
sive totals, the dominant Schmidt 
scored 21.5 points over the three 
games, more than any player on
either side.
The team was also strong
defensively throughout the 
match, holding Calvin to a .068 
hitting percentage, allowing only 
36 kills on 146 attempts.
However, the teams domi
nance against Calvin would not
translate to,success against their 
second round opponent, host 
school Mount St. Joseph.
This time around, Lechleitner 
turned up her play, hitting 24 of 
45 attempts with 8 misses. 
However, Schmidt was limited to 
14 kills on 49 attempts.
The one game the Tartans did 
win, the third, was still a narrow 
victory for them, as they finished 
with a score of 34-32, while 
Mount St. Joseph needed to score 
only 30 points to win their three 
games.
Despite the disappointing loss, 
the team can take pride in the fact 
they accomplished what they 
have been aiming since their 
inception: a trip to the national 
championship.
Indeed, the women have 
improved dramatically since last 
seasons ECAC championship. 
With the strong leadership of 
Schmidt and a strong core of 
younger talent, the squad has 
hopes of going even further next 
season.
Men qualify 
for NCAAs in 
cross country
The mens and womens cross 
country teams headed to Lehigh 
this past Saturday for the NCAA 
D-III regional championships.
The men did exceptionally well 
at the meet, placing four runners 
in the top 35, thereby earning AllRegion recognition.
In addition, senior Matt 
Dennerline, who turned in an
impressive eighth place finish 
with a time of 25:52.91, earned a 
bid to the national championship 
race, which is next Saturday.
Overall, the mens team fin
ished fourth, with a total of 129 
points. The only teams to beat the 
Tartans were Haverford, 
Elizabethtown, and Dickinson, all 
of whom traditionally show up for 
races.
Rounding out the top five fin
ishers for the men were sopho
more Darren Schultz (28th 
place), sophomore Pat Fisher 
(30th), senior John Hursh (31st), 
and junior Mike Rossi (37th).
On the womens side, the team 
managed only a 19th place finish. 
The squad was led once again by 
junior Katie Aerni, who finished 
the 5k run in 41st place, with a 
time of 19:42.95.Basketball 
tips off this 
Friday night
The mens and womens basket
ball teams get back in business 
this Friday night, as both teams 
take part in tournaments to kick 
off their seasons.
The men are hosting the West 
Penn Classic, and will be facing 
Washington & Jefferson on 
Friday, and return home to face 
Grove City on Saturday night.
The women host the CMU 
Tipoff Tournament Classic, and 
will be playing against Chatham, 
Wooster, and Albright over the 
two days.

MIDSEASON, from page A12 
Broncos, and its January 25, 
1998.
7. San Francisco (5-2)  Jeff 
Garcia has continued the 49ers 
incredible luck at quarterback. 
And hes doing a lot of it on his 
own. (Cue defensive Montana fans 
who think any compliment to 
someone else is a slight to their 
QB.)8. Chicago (6-1)  Listen up, if 
you get lucky two weeks in a row 
against teams the experts said 
wouldnt make the playoffs, then 
lucky is all you really are. I saw the 
Bears demolish the Bengals from 
the top row of Paul Brown 
Stadium, but Im still not sold.
9. San Diego (5-3)  Fluties 
fairy tale season continues, but 
not after playing a game his fans 
would call Rob Johnson-like last 
week in which he was sacked, 
intercepted, and knocked out 
before halftime.
10. Cincinnati (4-3) This pick 
will look ridiculous in a few weeks 
when they remember theyre the 
Bengals, so well let them have a 
peek at how the other 30 teams 
live.
Now I bet youre thinking, this 
guy is a moron! Half these teams 
wouldnt even be in the playoffs if 
they began today! Well, actually I 
wouldnt know. Remember, I 
wrote this before Sundays games.
But since you asked, heres what 
the playoff match-ups would be if 
the season did end last Monday 
(remember, it didnt; thats why 
there are still games):
Contraction a sure sign of work stoppage in MLB
AFC
Chargers @ Steelers
Ravens @ Jets
Raiders, Dolphins get byes
NFC
Saints @ Eagles
Packers @ 49ers
Bears, Rams get byes
So that wasnt as exciting as you 
thought it would be. Thats okay. 
We got midseason All-Pro awards 
coming from RJ, but only at the 
offensive skill positions. This is 
so I can sound informed without 
actually being in the know and 
without having connections.
RJs Midseason Skilled 
Offense
QB: Jeff Garcia  he hasnt 
been as ridiculously efficient as 
Gannon, as flashy as Warner, or as 
gritty as Favre, but he seems to be 
doing more with less than any 
quarterback in the league. A sort 
of white, unhyped Donovan 
McNabb.
RB: Jerome Bettis  if most 
(all?) of my readers (if applicable) 
go to school in Pittsburgh, then 
this is an obvious choice. Hes hav
ing his 1997 season all over again 
(for that matter, so is Kordell), 
which was the last time the 
Steelers made the playoffs.
RB: Corey Dillon  hey, the 
Bengals are winning, and hes the 
reason. His 96-yard touchdown 
against the Lions showed that hes
faster than Mike Brown gave him 
credit for. Put him on the Rams 
and he puts up Faulk-like num
bers. Maybe.
WR: Rod Smith  67 catches 
through eight games? The next 
closest WR on the Broncos has 15! 
Hes the most obvious choice for 
any All-Pro team this year. A 
league MVP-candidate if the 
Broncos make the playoffs.
WR: Troy Brown just because 
no one else put him down. The 
Patriots resurgence this year has 
been credited to Tom Brady, and 
David Patten has been involved in 
a lot of the highlight reels. But its 
Troy Brown who leads the team in 
receiving, as hes on pace for 106 
catches and a respectable eight 
touchdowns. Of course, the Rams 
were on pace to be undefeated, 
too....
Receiving TE: Tony Gonzalez; 
who else?
So what, now youre mad 
because all of the players except 
for Garcia are from the AFC, right? 
Or because you already know 
whos good and want to hear more 
mainstream media bashing? I 
guess Ill write a more satisfying 
column next week.
RJ Sikdar is going with the 
TITANS this Monday Night, which 
means bet on the RAVENS since hes 
been wrong the past two weeks, 
putting him on pace to pick incor
rectly every single game.
A View from the Bleachersi
by Matt Brun
I V ,
I Its been a full week, but Im still
pumped about that game seven.
| The overall quality of the game, 
combined with the fact that the 
Yankees actually lost is just mindboggling. Actually, I think the best 
part is that no one will remember 
the play Jeter made against the 
Athletics anymore.
Memories of that game alone 
would probably tide me over until 
spring training next March, but, for 
better or worse, there are many 
other topics to keep us baseball afi
cionados occupied in the near (and 
possibly distant) future.
Im referring, of course, to the 
contraction talk that has been 
unavoidable pretty much since 
September. One would think the 
process reached its peak last week 
when the owners overwhelmingly 
voted to eliminate two teams. In 
actuality, the whole thing is just 
getting started.
First off, no one has said which
two teams have been contracted. 
Since just about everyone in the 
world thinks its the Expos and 
Twins, theyre probably right, but 
the owners are still trying to use 
the secrecy as leverage against 
some small-market cities to build 
new stadiums.
This idea is, however, completely 
ludicrous. If a city is unwilling to 
pay for a stadium when the team 
threatens to leave, whats the dif
ference when it threatens to dis
band? Thats right, there isnt one.
As for the teams believed to be on 
the block, there might be a few 
people here and there who will 
miss the Expos, so no big deal, but 
getting rid of the Twins would be a 
huge mistake. Why eliminate one 
of the most respected organiza
tions in baseball (in terms of over
all history, not current status) 
when theres a joke of a franchise in 
Tampa Bay just begging to be elim
inated
The Devil Rays play in a five year 
old stadium thats in worse shape 
than Fenway, and have never come
close to resembling even a 
mediocre team.
Ive heard two reasons why the 
D-Rays are not at the top of the 
contraction list, and neither of 
them is any good. The first is that 
baseball doesnt want to admit it 
made a mistake by removing such a 
new team.
This makes no sense at 'all 
because the entire contraction 
process shows that a mistake was 
made in handing out teams. Since 
you have to cut somewhere, why 
not admit it didnt work out in 
Tampa Bay after a few miserable 
years rather than tear the collective 
heart out of a city thats been sup
porting its team for 41 years?
The second and more popular 
reason Ive heard is that commis
sioner Bud Selig doesnt want to 
upset Governor Bush and, by asso
ciation, President Bush, by remov
ing one of Floridas teams.
Excuse me? Since when did pro
fessional sports need the 
Presidents approval to make 
administrative decisions? Im sure
the President wasnt exactly 
pleased with the Texas Rangers 
performance this year, either; why 
not make a special motion to put 
them in the playoffs while were at 
it?
Believe it or not, all that isnt 
even the worst part of this mess. 
Along with the two teams, Major 
League Baseballs collective bar
gaining agreement also expired 
last week, with the owners and 
players scheduled to begin talks in 
a few weeks.
Now, we all remember what hap
pened last time these two parties 
tried to work out a deal, so just 
think of how the Players 
Association will react to the loss of 
the fifty jobs those two teams 
accounted for. If some sort of work 
stoppage loomed ominously 
before, it looks almost unavoidable 
now.
Matt Brun is sorry to see another 
wonderful baseball season end, but, 
as always, is glad to be able to devote 
more time to hockey. Go Red Wings!

Sudden-death overtime ends in penalty kick
Midseason 
recap of 
NFL action
120 Yards
by RJ Sikdar
As I write this, its been seven 
weeks for 22 NFL teams and eight 
weeks for the other nine, so its as 
close to the midseason as I can 
get for a column that posts on 
Mondays. Keeping in mind the allimportant deadline, know that 
everything you read below hinges 
on the fact that this past Sundays 
games didnt actually happen.
So when you read this and com
plain, this guy sucks, or I read 
that exact same thing at 
ESPN.com, or Ive never heard of 
Don Hutson, just know that it 
aint my fault. Also note that most 
of what you read here came from 
my own interpretation of things, 
meaning that Im no insider but 
Im still biased by my rooting inter
ests (Denver, Cincinnati, players 
on my fantasy team).
So tell me whos good already, 
damnit!
Fine!
First, RJs top 10 (as of week 
EIGHT, not NINE):
1. Oakland (6-1)  Hey, they 
demoralized a talented team on 
national television in two consecu
tive weeks (at Philly, vs Denver), 
the latter breaking the 
Shanacurse which has hexed them 
since 1995. Breaking is in quotes 
because theyre still 2-11 against 
him overall and 0-6 in Denver.
2. St. Louis (6-1)  A coach 
with balls, a QB with moxie, a RB 
with brains, three WRs with, and 
on, speed. Plus, theyre not unde
feated, so theres less reason to 
hate em....
3. Pittsburgh (5-2)  Kris 
Brown has anything but his worst 
day ever and theyre 6-1 and the 
town loves him. As it is, Browns 
misses at least give Steeler fans a 
new player to trash (formerly 
Kordells position).
4. Miami (5-2)  The only team 
to beat the Raiders. Plus, theyre 
one of only five teams unbeaten at 
home. And Lamar Smith is pretty 
good. Thats about it.
5. Baltimore (5-3)  Hey, 
theyre still two games over .500, 
theyre unbeaten at home, and 
their defense is still tough as any. 
And theyre learning humility, too.6. Green Bay (5-2)  Never bet 
against Favre. Ever. Unless hes a 
12.5-point favorite in the Super 
Bowl, your favorite team is the

Junior midfielder Matt Crummy works his defenders earlier this season against Point Park. The soc
cer teams season ended last weekend in the NCAA Division III tournament.
by Christopher Chung
Special Projects Manager
The bleachers were racked with hun
dreds of shivering fans, their hands 
stuffed in jacket pockets and heads bur
rowed deep into fuzzy hats, and they 
puffed steamy breaths into the frigid 
night air.
A few came and went, carrying styro
foam cups of hot chocolate or coffee, but 
just about everyone riveted their eyes on 
the brightly spotlighted soccer field 
down before the stands, and a mens 
NCAA Division III regional nail-biter 
that was in progress.
Battling in a deadlocked 1-1 match 
last Friday evening, Carnegie Mellons 
Tartans, the UAA champs and two-time 
NCAA tournament competitors, and 
Messiah Colleges Falcons, last years 
Division III champions and the nations 
number one team, played on into over
time.
With three minutes remaining in the 
first overtime period, a Falcon midfield
er, tailed by a Tartan defender, broke 
towards the goal with the ball. The two 
players got caught up, hit the field hard, 
and the referee called a foul on Carnegie 
Mellon: penalty kick for the Falcons.
The buzzing Messiah crowd exploded 
with cheers.
One minute later, after the Falcon 
player blasted a bullet into the lower left 
corner beneath the arms of Carnegie 
Mellons goalkeeper Tom Dougherty, 
almost everyone in and around the field 
stood and jumped and cheered for the 
Falcons 2-1 victory.
Carnegie Mellon players were in 
shock. Some walked slowly towards the 
sidelines, some just stood there, and 
some did what Dougherty did: he
remained on the cold grass, kneeling,
his head on the ground.
Immediately after, it was one of 
those things where you are in a state of 
disbelief, said Dougherty. To fight 
hard and take the number one team in 
the nation to overtime, and lose like 
that. Youre almost speechless. So many 
what ifs.
The Tartans incredible season was 
over, and for seniors like Dougherty, and 
midfielders Brian Morgan and Steve 
Tepper, so were their collegiate soccer 
careers  all decided by a single whis
tle, late in a sudden-death extra session.
It is just frustrating to have it end a 
call like that, said Dougherty. It sucks 
when the referee decides the game, 
especially in overtime.
The past two years have been memo
rable for the mens soccer team, going 
an overall 28-6 (14-3 both years), and 
making the NCAA tournament both 
years as well.
Last year they lost to Messiah badly, 
and came out much more on target this 
time around, also having beaten 
Bethany College two days before, 2-1, 
for Carnegie Mellons first NCAA soccer 
tournament win.
I was glad to repeat as conference 
champions, said Dougherty, and espe
cially to win the first NCAA game in 
school history.
That experience from last season, and 
added NCAA toughness, helped the 
Tartans stay as competitive as they were 
in Fridays game against Messiah.
This year we were a much more 
mature and more experienced team, 
and that helped a lot, said Dougherty. 
We had an idea of what to expect and 
what it would take for us to be in the 
game.

Tartan playoff hopes dashed by Rhodes in final minutes
by Preston Treichel
Staffwriter 
& Balaji Sarpeshkar
Sports Editor
The 2001 Tartan football team 
will be best remembered as one of 
the more exciting teams in the 
recent years. In their standard 
2001 style, CMU played another 
barnburner, this time against 
Rhodes College last Saturday in 
Memphis. This time, luck didnt 
fall CMUs way, as they lost in the 
final seconds 35-32.
Everything was coming together 
for the CMU offense, as they 
amassed nearly 500 yards total on 
the day. Furthermore, about 400 
of those yards came on the ground, 
despite an injury to sophomore RB
Ricardo the Spark Clarke on the 
Tartans first drive. Despite that 
staggering statistic, CMU was still 
unable to capitalize for a win.
The offensive line should be 
commended, said head coach 
Rich Lackner. They were the main 
factor in us rushing the ball real 
well. Our fullback position was a 
strong area also.
The CMU fullbacks carried the 
offense through most of the game, 
with senior Jeffrey Stolper rushing 
for almost 240 yards and one 
touchdown and junior Adam 
Urbanczyk rushing for four touch
downs.
The Tartans passing game was 
going nowhere quickly in the first 
half, though, but that changed 
when junior QB Sebastian Smelko 
came on the field. Smelko would
give the Tartans some yards in the 
air, throwing for nearly 100 yards 
in the second half.
However, while the Tartans 
offense ran all over the Lynx, their 
defense was unable to prevent a 
similar turnout. The CMU rushing 
defense held up strong, but the 
passing defense was unable to 
entirely contain Lynx QB Gary 
Rockne, who battered the Tartans 
both in the air and even on the 
ground, picking up some quick 20 
yard scampers.
The real story of the game, how
ever, came in the final two minutes 
of the game when CMU was down 
28-25 going into what appeared to 
be their final drive. After a few key 
plays that helped put the Tartans 
deep into Lynx territory, 
Urbanczyk plunged in for a two
yard run to put the Tartans up by 
three. Sophomore Michael 
Palmers extra point increased the 
spread to 32-28.
All the Tartans had to do now 
was hold on for a couple more min
utes and the game was theirs. The 
game plan for the kickoff was to 
squib kick it left, but it ended up in 
the hands of speedy wide receiver 
Hayes Mathis. The result was a 82 
yard kickoff return for a touch
down.
The time remaining was not 
enough for the Tartans to make 
another memorable comeback. 
The special teams were having 
trouble covering returns all game 
 over 200 of the Lynxs yards 
came on returns  and in the end 
it came back to haunt them.
We wanted to squib it left, but
it ended up in the hands of 
[Mathis], said Lackner. You 
have to give them credit though, 
they did a good job. It was really 
a discouraging and difficult way 
to lose, especially after coming 
back from another deficit like 
that.
Now the Tartans look to the 
postseason situation next week. 
They are looking for a bid into the 
ECAC bowl, but there is a chance 
that might not happen.
Hopefully well get into a bowl 
game next weekend, but if not, 
well play Bethany, said Lackner. 
Many teams are sitting at the same 
or similar 8-2 mark, waiting to see 
how the postseason situation 
unfolds. The Tartans will find out 
later today where and when they 
play next weekend.
Swimmers impressive 
against tough visitors
by Balaji Sarpeshkar
Sports Editor
A week after harvesting a crop 
of records and medals at 
Rochesters Harvest Relays, 
Carnegie Mellons swimmers 
came home and prepared to host 
one of the largest meets of the 
young season  the CMU 
Invitational.
Facing some intense competi
tion in the likes of D-III power
houses Emory and Johns Hopkins, 
the Tartans had to show that the 
strong start to their year wasnt 
just a consequence of facing lesser 
foes, and that they could indeed 
compete with the elite talent some 
of their conference opponents 
field.
And faced with the task of 
showing their talent under this 
kind of pressure, the swimmers 
went out and did what theyve 
done well all year: perform.
The whole team did really, 
really well, said head coach 
David Belowich. A lot of them 
swam as well or better this week
end than they have in their whole 
lives.
While the perennially dominant 
Emory won on both the mens and 
womens sides, both CMU teams 
certainly did nothing to taint their 
image as a hardworking and tal
ented team.
On the womens side, Emorys 
lead over the other teams was so
stifling that there was no opportu
nity for any other squad to come 
close. However, the competition 
on the mens side was much more 
close.
The talent is much more even
ly distributed on the mens side, 
said Belowich. The competition 
was much more intense.
Leading the rush for the Tartan 
men was sophomore Brian 
McCarthy, who has continued his 
season-long streak of outper
forming the competition, what
ever their level. In his first race, 
the 200 meter backstroke, he not 
only won, but broke the school 
record that he himself set last 
year. In addition, his time of 
1:52.76 earned him a B cut, or 
nationally qualifying time, in the 
event.
McCarthy would not stop there, 
however. He continued his domi
nating presence by winning virtu
ally every race he swam in, setting 
new pool records in both the 400 
meter individual medley (IM) and 
the 100 meter backstroke. 
McCarthy also recorded national
ly qualifying times in those events.
Finally, in the 400 yard freestyle 
relay, McCarthy led off the fourman relay team with a time of 
47.71, giving his teammates an 
ample lead to work with.
His start in the 400 relay was 
easily the best in his life, said 
Belowich. And it was a good fin
ish for him. He really had a comSee SWIM, page All

Heather Kendra remembers her 
teams last regular season game 
three Saturdays ago, against Case 
Western Reserve University in 
freezing snow, and says that after 
that 3-0 victory, everyone was 
laughing and smiling, at that 
moment it all came together.
This past season, just about 
everything did come together for 
the womens soccer team, who two 
weeks ago earned a first-ever bid to 
the ECAC Mid-Atlantic tourna
ment, won two games, and finally 
lost on Sunday, November 4, in the 
finals to a strong Johns Hopkins 
team.
The 2-0 loss wasnt even as com
petitive as it could have been, 
according to senior defender and 
captain Katie Snell.
Going into the ECACs I think it 
was the whole teams goal to go to 
finals and win the tournament, 
she said. ... The final against JHU 
was really frustrating. We didnt 
play up to our ability, and on anoth
er day I think we couldve beat 
them.
The Tartans did lose the ECAC 
final, but the real story is in the suc
cess that this team has reaped this 
past season, improving from 6-12 
last year to 13-5-1, even tying 
Washington University, one of the 
top-ranked teams in the country.
It was very rewarding to have

finished with such a strong record, 
said sophomore midfielder Merry 
McConnochie. Heather has us 
make personal and team goals dur
ing preseason. Personally, after 
last years 6-12 finish I had made 
my goal to finish above .500 ... but 
this was much, much better.
It feels great, said Kendra. We 
competed well in the region and 
had a pretty good showing in con
ference this year. The record is a 
direct reflection of the teams abili
ty to get it done and take care of 
business.

When it comes to campus eating, 
the consensus among most 
Carnegie Mellon students is that 
theyve gotten the short end of the 
stick. In recent years, students have 
rebelled against Highlanders poor 
quality of food, but then lamented 
its departure  it was the only 
cafeteria, after all  and put up 
with surly vendors and less-thansavory cuisine in the UC. When offcampus establishments such as 
Subway and Eat n Park were added 
to the meal plan, for many, it was a 
ray of light in an otherwise unpalat
able world. Imagine, then, students 
uncontrollable excitement when 
Campus XPress, CMUs prepaid 
debit card, underwent a massive 
overhaul at some point before the 
Fall semester began.
Huh? Campus XPress has 
changed, you say? Yes, and 
admirably so: From laundry tokens 
to Boston Market, for returning stu
dents and first-years alike, Campus 
XPress is not the limited account it 
used to be. It is certainly worth con
sidering for a multitude of reasons, 
some of which are discussed below: 
Campus XPress is relatively sim
ple to use and obtain. An account 
can be opened with a minimum $25 
deposit plus a one-time $15 fee. 
Deposits can be made at any time 
through the HUB, and balances

method of payment on campus, as it 
is accepted in dining facilities, 
University stores, and so forth. This

Campus XPress is accepted, the 
HUB decided to throw in a free

the best deal of the bunch, as it

The 20th Three Rivers Film 
Festival kicked off last week 
with an opening weekend that 
featured the local premiere of 
The Bread, My Sweet, the debut 
feature of Strip District film
maker Melissa Martin. 
Saturday night, Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers celebrated their 
own 30th anniversary with a 
massive seven-hour long birth
day bash called MEDIA/TONIC 
that turned their North 
Melwood Avenue facility into a 
combination concert venue, 
gallery, and party space.
For the event, local artists
installed pieces in everything 
from classrooms to video edit
ing suites while sound stages 
were used for performances by 
bands that included Luna and 
members of The Mekons as well 
as local groups and DJs. The 
buildings two screening rooms 
showed a retrospective of filmand video-maker Paul Glabicki 
and other films and videos by 
local artists.
One of the most popular 
attractions was the Muybridge

by forcing the audience members to 
open up, stretch, and introduce 
themselves to each other.
Once everyone returned to their 
seats, Wimsatt took the emotional 
temperature of the room by asking 
all who were present to raise their 
hands if they felt wise. Ignorant. 
Experienced. Like a good listener. 
Like a bad listener. Sheltered. 
Brave. Insecure.
Before continuing with the lec

of the show, art students Noel 
Hefele (senior) and Adam Grossi 
(junior), who were also responsible 
for the related hip-hop show on 
Friday night in the Drill Deck, 
which featured J-Live, Cannibal 
Ox, El Da Sensei, and Virtuoso. The 
show was set up in part by Red Tape 
Productions (which is, essentially, 
three local high school kids), and 
cost a canned food donation for 
Food Not Bombs. The show was a 
huge success, collected piles of 
donations and showcased some 
serious breakdancing.

Facing another depressing night 
of too much work and not enough 
time even to sleep, many students 
decided that it was more important 
to learn how to save the world. In a 
lecture called Why CMU Geeks are 
Americas Best Hope for Saving Our 
Asses in the 21st Century, William 
Upski Wimsatt did more than just 
tell students what theyre not doing 
right  he told students how to do 
things better.
Billy Wimsatt is a short, loud man 
in his late twenties. Hes the author 
of two books (No More Prisons and 
Bomb the Suburbs), the founder of 
dozens of activist organizations, 
and hes got a lot to say about 
activism.
Before the lecture Thursday 
night, several campus activist orga

50 years ago, November 13, 
1951 The Council of Fraternity 
Presidents decided to proactively 
redefine the rules concerning 
scheduling fraternity parties. The 
rule will state that an open 
house party will mean that any
one (Greek or not) is invited, 
however, liquor will not be served 
by the house. If the fraternity 
wishes to have liquor, it will need 
to sign up as a closed house 
party and maintain a guest list.
Math Department Head 
Professor Joseph B. Rosenbach 
passed away this week. He joined 
the faculty in 1920 and became 
assistant head of the 
Mathematics Department in 1946 
and head of the department in 
-\1950.
Due to the recent lackluster 
K performance of the first-year 
{' class on the annual traditions
exam, the Student Council has 
adopted a policy to ask that all 
campus organizations must sub
mit a list of first-year rosters to 
the Deans office. Then, the orga
nization leaders will be held 
responsible for those members 
who did not pass the exam.
25 years ago, November 9, 
1976  The Preferred Interview 
Choice System (PICS) was imple
mented in the Career Planning 
and Placement Center to help stu
dents interview with potential 
employers. Each student will be 
issued three PICS cards, allowing 
them to have three appointments 
with company representatives 
during the spring semeser 1977.
Interest in the ROTC at 
Carnegie Mellon University has 
sparked some changes in the pro
gram. Programs such as orien
teering, marksmanship, and sur
veying improved. Some academ
ic courses could be substituted for 
some required ROTC courses. 
The ROTC program emphasizes 
development and enhancement 
of leadership abilities.
10 years ago, November 11, 
1991 Student Senate adopted a 
policy that attacked the discrimi
nation policy of the ROTC pro
gram on campus. If the discrimi
nation based on sexual orienta
tion is not terminated, then the 
University will get rid of all ROTC 
programs by the 1995-1996 acad
emic year.
Greeks adopted a new alcohol 
policy based on risk manage
ment. Under the system, a set of 
guidelines put together by insur
ance companies for national fra
ternities would reduce the risk of
something bad happening. It also 
includes the prohibition of pur
chasing of kegs and purchasing 
any bulk quantities of alcohol. It 
also prohibits any member from 
tolerating, permitting, encourag
ing, or participating in any drink
ing game.
5 years ago, November 11,
1996  Dr. Richard J. Duffin, 
emeritus University Professor of 
Mathematical Sciences, passed 
away on October 29 following a 
long battle with colon cancer. He 
made numerous contributions to 
the field of mathematics as well 
as dedicating time and his life to 
students. He joined the depart
ment in 1946 and regularly 
taught undergraduate and gradu
ate courses.
Online registration of courses 
were to be streamlined and ready
to go online. The current RAD 
form process had the tedious 
properties of obtaining the prop
er signatures for authorization. 
An electronic system would 
enable students to submit their 
schedules online and would 
queue students automatically.

1 year ago, November 13, 
2000  The first annual Geek 
Week was held this week by the 
Activities Board. With events 
ranging from playing with toys 
and watching movies with nerd 
appeal to playing video games. 
Organizers found a variety of 
playthings from the past such as 
Play-Doh, Lite Brite, Mr. And Mrs. 
Potato Head, and over 36,000
Legos. Video game competitions 
occurred on a variety of plat
forms including the Sega 
Dreamcast, Sony Playstation 2, 
and even the old Nintendo 
Entertainment System.
The University continued plans 
to establish a branch campus in 
Silicon Valley. Currently, the 
2000-acre Ames Moffett Field site 
about 40 miles south of San 
Francisco would set aside about 
40 acres for Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University of 
California at Santa Cruz to form a 
center that would do joint 
research with NASA, e-commerce 
programs, robotics, software 
engineering, and others.

Impressive performance by CMU dancers
Jennifer Resick performs in Pretty Good Year, choreographed by Ahnya Chang with music by Tori Amos.
Students at Billy Wimsatts lecture raise their hands to answer questions relating to emotional temperature.
of the lecture, Wimsatt pointed 
out first the blind spots of a 
Carnegie Mellon education. Quite 
frankly, he said, CMU students are 
afraid to fail. Would anybody dis- agree? The comment struck deep 
with most members of the audi
ence for its poignant truth, partic
ularly as he went on to say that 
CMU students are also afraid to 
challenge authority figures, and to 
be challenged, themselves.
Following those criticisms, 
Wimsatt introduced Pittsburgh 
poet Luqman-Abdul Salaam, who 
also spoke to the self-imposed and 
external stress of life at CMU, and 
students choices about how to live 
in that environment: Can you live 
one day without stress? he asked 
the audience. Looking around, the 
crowd seemed to respond mental
ly with a huge, resounding no.
Wimsatt took the stage again, 
and discussed a bit of the content 
of his books: prison growth and 
the military-industrial complex, 
American foreign policy (punctu
ated by shouts that The oil. Is 
going. To run. Out!), and alterna
tive educational choices.
Then came the focal point of 
the evening: Wimsatts proposed 
solutions to CMU students (and 
that of other students) problems 
with school  how to deal with 
the stress and unhappiness, dis
satisfaction, and frustration. In a 
list of 10 items, he told the attencollege degree. For the rest of the 
list, he encouraged the audience 
to find great professors, rather 
than staying within a depart
ment, and to do that by asking 
everyone who would answer, 
which professors are good teach
ers. Find out-of-school mentors. 
Link every paper written for a 
class to something relevent and 
current, thereby doing research 
for people who need it, instead of 
just doing an assignment. Go to 
demonstrations. Combine act
ivism with daily life. And, most 
importantly, when feeling over
whelmed, start up an honest con
versation with any person. Take 
a risk.
Wimsatt closed the lecture with 
encouragement to fill out the sur
veys hed passed around, and invi
tations to join the Cool Rich Kids 
Movement, a group of young peo
ple with money, who are willing to 
learn how to use it, and willing to 
use it for good causes.
For people who didnt feel like 
everything had been addressed at 
the lecture, Wimsatt also held a dis
cussion group on Friday, where stu
dents gathered to ask how to get 
involved, how to get organizations 
off the ground, and how to deal 
with burning out. His response: 
Moderate. Delegate. Ask for help. 
He implored students to know their 
limits, because his mentor, at the 
age of 40, had recently worked
ments for the movement, instead of 
recognizing the value of life.
The extraordinarily emotional 
discussions forced participating 
students to look inward and try to 
find in themselves the energy for 
more than just work. And the stu
dents seemed to be finding it, 
because Wimsatt said, I go to a lot 
of places, and this is one for the 
most inspiring.
Take that, apathy ratings. Take 
that, people who want to stereo
type CMU as Wimsatt himself ini
tially did: a cold technical place 
of technical geniuses/idiot savants 
with no social skills. He says now 
that Its still mostly true, but 
there are a lot of exceptions.
A circle of students sitting in 
the Alumni Lounge also shared 
their impressions of CMU. Denia 
Djokic, a first-year student in 
physics, is a native of Vienna, 
Austria, and went to a high 
school that was very competitive 
and in actuality, rather like the 
stereotype of Carnegie Mellon. 
Theres so much appreciation 
for people [here], for one anoth
er. Im used to this dark, cynical 
attitude that people see in CMU. 
So maybe things arent as bad as 
they seem. Noel Hefele agreed: 
Who says intellect has to be sep
arate from emotion? Maybe the 
stereotype can be broken yet. 
Billy Wimsatt has shown students 
how to begin.

DANCE, from page B1 
that truly conveyed the 
meaning of the songs 
title.
Rendevous, choreo
graphed by Rachel Kingery 
and Jennifer Resick, had sev
eral transitions in speed and 
lifts that kept the audience 
on their toes and waiting to 
see what would happen 
next.
The show included tap 
performances, which added 
to the eclectic range of gen
res of dance. The first of three 
tap pieces was choreograpliedby 
Nicole Rodriguez to Mchael 
Jacksons Smooth CriminaL 
The performance began 
with black light that 
revealed only the white tops 
of the dancers who later 
came into view wearing 
black pants and hats. After 
competing with the music to 
pound out the sounds of 
their taps for most of the per
formance, the music came to 
a stop and the dancers took 
the tapping into full effect.
Dancers were able to 
show off their hips doing 
the hula in Palehua, 
choreographed by Cymri 
Chang, give a little atti
tude in Discotheque, 
choreographed by 
Michelle OMalley, and 
reveal a more graceful side 
in All You Want, by 
Cinnamon Jvonne Carr.
Pretty Good Year,
with music by Tori Amos 
and choreographed by 
Ahnya Chang, brought 
out the emotions of the 
audience with a calm 
beginning that soon 
transitioned into red 
lights and anger, but 
then back to its starting 
point. With over 15 girls 
on stage, the coordina
tion of the performance 
was more than impres
sive.
Eli Re Eli brought 
bright colors, lots of 
lighting changes, and a 
traditional Indian dance. 
In lieu of instrumental 
music, the audience 
enjoyed the rhythm of 
tapping in the last per
formance of the act, 
Showoff. The tapping 
sounds echoeing through 
Rangos Hall were plenty to 
entertain the eager audi
ence. The piece hightlighted the talents of the 
performers with solos by 
each.
After the intermission, 
the show came back with 
the classic Pony by 
Genuine and Push it by 
Salt n Pepa in Control, 
choreographed by T.I.M, 
which had that audience 
on their feet cheering 
before the show even 
started. It began with a 
steamy performance by 
the guys to Genuine and
later brought in the girls 
to show off a few flips 
and solos.
Mack the Knife, 
choreographed by Erin 
Nunes, brought smiles to 
all the faces in the audi
ence. With 16 people on 
the stage wearing all 
black with bowler hats, 
the performance was 
light and fun.
Jennifer Samples choreo
graphed More Than That, 
an impressive ballet perfor
mance which added to the 
variety of dance genres that 
night. The three dancers 
wore long white dresses 
with gold highlights. The 
skill, balance, and perfection 
in each of their solo perfor
mances portrayed the effort 
put into the piece.
Emilie McLaughilin 
choreographed Tango 
de Roxanne, from 
Moulin Rouge. This per
formance was one of the 
best of the evening, per
haps expected due to the 
inspiration of this sum
mers blockbuster film. 
Everything from the lifts, 
turns, spins, costumes 
and lighting suggested 
the theme of being torn 
between love and stabili
ty that the song portrays.
Re-Introduction, 
choreographed by 
Caroline Choe, was hiphop at its best. The dance
had attitude, and talent 
to back it up. Their cos
tumes and solos made 
for a great performance.
The next two perfor
mances were near opposites. 
I Need to Know, with 
music by Marc Anthony and 
choreographed by Serena 
Lam, brought a more salsa 
style, while Devil Went 
Down to Georgia, choreo
graphed by Amber 
Andreaco, pulled out the tap 
shoes and provided some 
knee-slapping rhythm.
The last performance 
of the night, Michael and 
Janet Jacksons Scream 
choreographed by 
Eunice Bae and Ahnya 
Chang, made a great 
finale to the show. The 
eight performers came 
out tied in straight jack
ets, but slowly broke free 
as the song progressed. 
Besides the costumes, 
their dark eye makeup 
added to the sense of 
insanity.
One of the most amaz
ing parts of is the variety 
of talent displayed by 
such a variety of stu
dents, who seem to 
come from every major. 
Watching the enjoyment 
they got out of perform
ing in the show made it 
an even better experi
ence for the whole audi
ence.

The event was a huge success 
with over 1,500 people attending 
and had Filmmakers staffers 
caught between conflicting feel
ings of wanting to do another 
such party soon and never wanti

intense work involved. All in all 
the party was an excellent blend 
of art and celebration; just the 
kind of innovative event that 
Pittsburgh could use more of.
But the real focus of the festival 
is of course the films, which are in 
abundance more so than any other 
time of the year. The festival con
cludes this week with another 
round of just-released world cine
ma, under-the-radar American 
independents, short programs, and 
classic re-releases. The yearly festi
val is the areas best opportunity to 
see a variety of new films from 
across Europe, Asia, America, and 
other parts of the world.
Screenings are held at the 
Regent Square Theater (1035 S. 
Braddock Avenue) in Edgewood, 
the Harris Theater (809 Liberty

lesbian cultural studies and use 
both documentary and experi

History Lessons, is a subversively 
satirical investigation into the 
way female homosexuality is and 
has been intimated and treated in
pop culture, especially in films 
and television that pre-date the 
womens rights movement.

mat for home movies. Since 
video has more or less wiped out 
these formats from the main
stream, these films have been 
largely discarded, and the most 
obvious local institution to give 
them to was Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers.
As a result, Filmmakers has a 
huge trove of these relics that 
includes everything from forgot
ten but poignant documents of 
everyday life to the most bizarre 
films to grace celluloid. Anyone 
whos seen some of these films 
knows how improbably strange 
they are. This event is especially 
for those with a sweet tooth for 
kitschy relics of the past. The 
event is free and part of Light Up

* Cure (Japan, 1997)
Auteur Kiyoshi Kurosawa (no 
relation to Akira) has established 
himself as one of the masters of 
contemporary Japanese cinema. 
While long a fixture on the festi
val circuit, Cure is his first film to 
be distributed in the states. The 
film is an atmospheric and poetic 
take on the police detective/seri
al killer genre.
Detective Takabe wanders 
through a bleak urban milieu, on 
a seemingly hopeless chase for a 
serial killer that is terrorizing the 
city by effecting murder not with 
his own hands but by using peo
ple as puppets; making them kill 
through persuasion with only the 
simplest of means. As Takabe 
gets closer, he becomes more and 
more psychologically vulnerable 
to a killer with disturbing similar
ities to his wife, who suffers from 
a mental illness.

No Tips, No Love (USA, 2001)
Local filmmakers, Thierry 
Ngooh and Fred-Alex Ferly, have 
been working for over three years 
on this feature, a bona fide exam
ple of low-budget tenacious 
moviemaking. Shot in 16mm, the 
film will be projected on video 
from editing done on an AVID 
machine. The film, set and shot 
in Pittsburgh, tells the story of 
three young women working a 
summer job at an Italian restau
rant coming to terms with their 
identities against the pressures of 
their friends and families.
Ferly, a former Parisian, is a fix
ture of the Pittsburgh Filmmakers 
community and will be recogniz
able to anyone taking classes at

true labor of love, an example of 
independent filmmaking at its

* That Obscure Object of Desire 
(France/Spain 1977)
Luis Buuel was one of the great
est filmmakers the world ever pro
duced, and was easily one of the 
most unique and funniest among 
them all. His bizarre blend of sur
realism with satire and a taste for 
the absurd is impossible to mistake 
for anyone else. Buuel, a 
Spaniard, got his start in the late 
20s, working with Salvador Dali to 
create his first film and master
piece, Un Chien Andalou.
Buuel made films in Spain, 
Mexico, and finally France, after 
being exiled from the first two 
countries for his aggressive satire 
that repeatedly targeted the aris
tocracy and the church, among 
other institutions. His films were 
sometimes so inflammatory that 
at one premiere, he went with 
stones loaded in his pockets, for
self-defense in case the audience 
turned on him.
That Obscure Object of Desire 
was his last film, and is counted 
among his masterpieces. The 
film tells the story of an aging 
aristocrat pining after an 
unreachable young woman, who 
is played by two different women 
in typical Bunuelian fashion. If 
youve never seen a Buntiel film, 
prepare for an entirely unique 
experience.

Urban Ghost Story (UK, 1998)
Made in 1998 but only just now 
being released, Genevive 
Jolliffes Urban Ghost Story is a 
horror movie set in a high-rise 
tenement in present day Glasgow. 
A 12-year-old girl is seriously 
injured in a car crash, (rather 
spuriously induced by ecstasy) 
that takes the life of her 
boyfriend. Not long after the
crash a spirit begins to haunt the 
apartment where she lives.
What separates the film from 
traditional horror films, though, 
is its elements of social criticism. 
The ghost is an incarnation of 
sorts of poverty and alienation 
and the girl in the story is under 
threat of being taken from her 
heroin-addicted mother.

Novel innovations emerge at CMUs Green Design Initiative promotes 
Entrepreneurial Bridge Event environmentally sound business practices
by Shilpa Desai
Junior Staffwriter
The Entrepreneurial 
Bridge Event, sponsored by 
ITU Ventures, was held on 
Monday, November 5. The 
events purpose was to bring 
together talented MBA and 
engineering students from 
across campus in order to 
present an entrepreneurial 
id^a to a panel of judges. 
Stephan Mueller, an MBA 
student at CMU, primarily 
organized the event through 
the Entrepreneurship Club 
and the Venture Capital and 
Private Equity Club.
The event spanned two 
nights, the first of which was 
Thursday, November 1. 
Seven teams, consisting of 
three to seven people, were 
formed based on common 
interests. The teams were 
given until last Monday to 
fine tune their ideas and 
come up with mini-business 
plans. The teams were given 
five minutes to do a presenta
tion of their plan, and then 
the judges picked the top
three. Mueller believes that 
when a group is looking for 
money to finance a start up 
company, it really needs to 
pitch to people, and its diffi
cult to even get their atten
tion. So the teams were 
given five minutes to intrigue 
the judges  much like they 
would have to intrigue poten
tial financers in real life. The 
top three teams were then 
called back one at a time and 
were asked questions by the 
judges for 10 to 15 minutes. 
From these top three, the 
judges picked a winning 
team. The competitors were 
mostly GSIA students, with a 
ratio of four to one, with peo
ple from Computer Science, 
Robotics, and some under
graduate students. To pro
vide a real-world judging 
process, the judges consisted 
of venture capitalists, suc
cessful entrepreneurs, and 
entrepreneurship professors.
There were many colorful 
ideas presented this year, and 
the top three included: 
SuVee, an idea for Webbased program management 
software for automotive part
suppliers; GreenVision, an 
idea for desulfurization tech
nology for diesel and gaso
line; KitchenSync, a syn
chronization tool for AOL 
personal filing cabinet and 
Outlook, PALM, Lotus, etc.
The winning team, 
SuVee, was awarded a $600 
cash prize. The teams leader, 
Chirantan Parikh, found the 
event to be a great learning 
experience. I had the idea 
for a long time but never 
worked on the details in terms 
of the revenue model, value 
proposition, market size and 
challenges. Putting the pre
sentation together forced us 
to review the details and it 
further reinforced the busi
ness concepts, he said. The 
team plans to put its idea into 
practice in the future, and to 
participate in the annual 
Pittsburgh EnterPrize Event 
and the Carrot Capital New 
York Business Plan 
Competition. All of us 
agreed that it was a heck of a 
lot more interesting and excit
ing than the homework and 
case studies normally done in 
business school, Parikh said.Microsoft, government reach settlement in antitrust case
by Chirag Nangia
Staffwriter
The three year court battle 
between software giant 
Microsoft and the US govern
ment, with the support of 18 
states, appears to be drawing 
to a close. The two sides had 
agreed to an out-of-court set
tlement, but the terms could 
not be sealed. Microsofts 
attempts to hammer out a 
solution to its antitrust case 
remain mired in uncertainty. 
As Microsoft, the federal gov
ernment and states continue 
negotiations over the details 
of a deal, the outlook for the 
company seems little clearer 
than when the preliminary 
agreement was announced 
earlier this month.
What are the terms of 
the settlement?
Microsoft agreed to restric
tions in their business prac
tices, including a panel of 
independent monitors to 
oversee its conduct and 
review its accounts. 
Crucially, Microsoft would be 
obliged to provide rival soft
ware firms with information 
to allow them to develop 
competing products, and 
ensure those products work 
with the Windows operating 
system. The restrictions will 
stop Microsofts unlawful 
conduct, prevent recurrence 
of similar conduct in the 
future and restore competi
tion in the software market, 
achieving prompt, effective, 
and certain relief for con
sumers and businesses, the 
Department of Justice said.
So who won?
The worst outcome in 
regard to Microsoft would 
have been a forced split into 
two separate companies for 
the software giant. However, 
Microsoft successfully avoid
ed that action. Although 
Microsoft has to make some 
concessions to aid its com
petitors, many analysts have 
suggested Microsoft has 
escaped relatively lightly, at 
least when compared with 
the original sentence in the 
first round of the trial. Many 
critics of the new deal claim 
that the deal will not be 
enough to stop Microsoft
from performing anti-competitive practices.
What accusations did 
Microsoft face?
The US Department of 
Justice alleged that Microsoft 
had used its significant domi
nation of the operating sys
tem market to restrict compe
tition, in giving special deals 
to large computer manufac
turers like Dell and Compaq 
on its operating system if 
they exclusively installed 
Microsofts software prod
ucts.
US antitrust laws ban prac
tices in which monopolies 
that are in restraint of 
trade, use predatory pric
ing at below cost to drive out 
competitors, and price-fix
ing, an agreement among 
several competitors to fix 
prices or restrict output.
When IBM refused to drop 
sales of its own rival operat
ing system and software 
packages, Microsoft with
held the crucial details of 
Windows 95 until 15 minutes 
before it launched, causing

When the worlds of cutthroat business 
and tree-hugging environmentalism col
lide, rarely does it result in an outcome 
that benefits both. The Green Design 
Initiative, housed in CMUs Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration, is 
trying to change that by taking an analyt
ical approach to solving environmental 
problems relating to many aspects of sociMotfr# Toward* a Greener CM
ety. Scott Matthews, director of the ini
tiative, takes an all-encompassing view 
when describing the goals of the group, 
saying, The projects we choose to work 
on are looking at something in the world 
that we can make a contribution to.
The Green Design Initiative was origi
nally started about 10 years ago, with the 
goal of helping to solve problems that 
relate to design, engineering, and busi
ness. Matthews points out that, [The 
Green Design Initiatives] primary contri
bution is not activism. We take an acade
mic approach to problems. As environ
mental problems keep growing, it is 
becoming more important to create intel
ligent solutions that are cost-effective, 
and the primary way they do this is 
through academic studies.
The Green Design Initiative has made 
significant contributions to many aspects 
of environmentalism. For example, five 
years ago California wanted to reduce air 
pollution by better mandating vehicle air 
emissions. In fact, the state passed legis
lation requiring a percentage of cars to be 
zero emission vehicles. We looked at 
that term [zero emission] and became 
somewhat skeptical, said Matthews. 
We performed a study that showed that 
zero emission vehicles still contributed to 
air pollution in other ways ... The debate 
has since moved away from mandating 
specific types of vehicles to general reduc
tion of emissions.
Because the Green Design Initiative is 
so diverse in its nature, GSIA is the logi
cal choice for housing the project. The 
core group consists of approximately 15 
to 20 professionals and graduate stur 
dents, coming from many different 
backgrounds. The majority are engi
neers from various fields, but also 
included in the group are business, poli
cy, and science students. The eclectic 
mix of people is to ensure that every 
angle of a problem will be looked at and 
evaluated.
Currently, the Green Design Initiative 
working on the University Challenge. 
Were trying to save the $80,000 that we 
spent on wind energy, Matthews 
explained. Earlier this year, CMU decided
Erica DiBenedetto/Art Editor
that 5% of the Universitys energy would 
come from environmentally friendly, but 
more expensive, wind energy. The Green 
Design Initiative has installed meters to 
check energy usage in every university 
building to find ways energy, and there
fore money, can be saved.
Other projects Green Design Initiative 
are working to include research on nan
otechnology, which is building process
es, machines, and chemicals at the atom
ic level. Generally speaking, the 
Initiative is willing to try to tackle any 
problem it can. As Matthews says, We 
try to take on projects that we can make 
a difference in.District judge sets Microsoft case schedule
WASHINGTON (AP)  The judge in 
the Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial on 
Friday formally set the case to proceed 
early next year for the nine states that 
rejected a settlement with the software 
giant and the Justice Department.
US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly 
set the next courtroom hearing for March 
4 in that stage of the case. Those states 
must decide what sanctions the judge 
should impose on Microsoft, which earli
er was found to have violated federal 
competition laws.
Kollar-Kotellys scheduling order was 
widely expected and contained no sur
prises. She outlined her intent during 
courtroom hearings last week.
For the Justice Department and the 
nine other states that agreed to the settle
ment announced last week, the judge 
ordered government lawyers to give her a 
copy of the deal with Microsoft before 
Thursday, along with a study analyzing 
the impact of the agreement.
The agreement requires the company 
to provide technical details to help rivals 
make products compatible with its 
monopoly Windows operating system 
and to give an oversight panel full access 
to its books and plans for five years.
It also bans exclusive contracts with 
computer makers that put rival software 
vendors at a disadvantage.
Terms of the settlement are highly con
troversial, with many legal and industry 
experts  including some of Microsofts 
competitors  charging that the sanc
tions are inadequate and wont level the 
playing field against the company.
The judge said the government must 
publish summaries of the settlement and 
its competitive analysis in the The 
Washington Post, The New York Times and 
the San Jose Mercury News at least seven 
times during the last half of November.

Heinz Co. lowers earnings forecasts
PITTSBURGH (AP)  H.J. 
Heinz Co. lowered its earnings 
forecasts, citing the economic 
slowdown and a decline in 
restaurant dining in the wake of 
the September 11 attacks and 
higher-than-expected foreign 
supply costs. It shares fell nearly 
7% in trading Friday.
Heinz said late Thursday that 
it expects earnings to between 
59 cents and 60 cents per share 
for its recently-completed sec
ond quarter rather than its earli
er projection of between 64 
cents and 66 cents per share. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson 
Financial/First Call had been 
expecting 66 cents per share.
The lower earnings came 
despite an anticipated 10 per
cent increase in second quarter 
sales, the company said. Heinz 
isscheduled to release its second 
quarter earnings report 
December 13.
The Pittsburgh-based compa
ny also advised that its annual 
outlook will mirror first-half 
results. The company expects 
third-quarter earnings to be less
than the second quarter, with a 
stronger fourth quarter.
Analysts surveyed by 
Thomson Financial/First Call 
expected earnings per share of 
72 cents in the third quarter and 
69 cents in the fourth quarter.
Heinz blamed a decline in the 
number of people dining out 
since September 11, particularly 
at airports, hospitals and theme 
parks. The slump has caused a 
decline in restaurant meal pur
chases for the first time in 10 
years, according to the firm.
The company warned profits 
from its food service business 
will be lowered by $25 million 
to $30 million compared to a 
year ago.
Sales in Japan have been slow 
and high supply chain costs 
from the companys production 
base in New Zealand and 
Australia have adversely affect
ed the companys profits.
Heinz emphasized, however, 
that overall its food business  
particularly ketchup, sauces, 
soups, and desserts  remains 
sound.

Business Briefs
China invited 
to join WTO
The World Trade Organization 
formally invited China to join on 
Saturday, bringing the once-iso
lated communist country  and 
its 1.2 billion consumers  firmly 
into the global marketplace.
Trade ministers from almost all 
the WTOs 142 members approved 
Chinas application for member
ship, after than more 15 years of 
negotiations.
Chinese Trade Minister Shi 
Guangsheng said his country will 
abide by WTO rules and honor its 
commitments while enjoying its 
rights.
He added that China supported 
the WTOs plan to launch a new 
round of trade liberalization nego
tiations on the basis of full con
sideration of the interests and rea
sonable requests of developing 
countries.
The approval of China was 
planned to give the WTO maxi
mum publicity and to ensure that 
some positive news would come 
out of the meeting, which has the 
primary aim of launching the new 
round.
China first applied to join the 
WTOs predecessor, the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
in 1986. Since then it has been 
negotiating terms of membership 
with its major trading partners
and changing national and local 
laws to comply with WTO rules.
After a fraught final two years of 
talks, WTO negotiators finally 
approved the deal in Geneva in 
September.
China has made giant strides in 
opening its markets to become a 
major player in world trade, and 
the membership agreement com
mits it to continue dropping trade 
barriers over the next few years.
Its membership in the WTO 
means it will have to open its mar
kets to goods and services from 
other WTO members, but will also 
increase its export opportunities 
 a situation that its Asian neigh
bors especially regard with some 
apprehension.
China will become a full mem
ber of the WTO 30 days after its 
parliament ratifies the agreement 
and informs the WTO.OPEC mulls 
cut in output
Energy analysts say members of 
the OPEC oil cartel are sure to 
agree to cut oil production to try 
to reverse the recent slide in oil 
prices.
Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chavez told a news conference on 
the sidelines of the U.N. General 
Assemblys annual meeting 
Saturday that OPECs 11 member 
countries, including Venezuela, 
have reached a definite consensus to cut production by at least 1 
million barrels per day and per
haps as much as 1.5 million bar
rels per day.
Several non-OPEC producers 
have agreed not to hike their pro
duction, Chavez said, without 
naming any countries. Mexico and 
Norway have publicly demurred, 
while oil companies in Russia 
were reported on Friday as willing 
to trim output at some of their 
wells.
OPEC, which supplies about a 
third of the worlds oil, has 
already cut production three 
times this year. Although demand 
has continued to weaken, con
cern that higher prices might 
intensify the global economic 
malaise has made OPEC reluctant 
to cut output.
In just the past few days, howev
er, OPEC has become more 
assertive, with Saudi Arabia, the

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 12, 2001
Microsoft and Department of Justice work to finalize antitrust settlement
MICROSOFT, from page B4 
sales loses. Other PC makers had 
computers with Windows 95 prein
stalled and ready to ship, giving 
them a significant advantage over 
IBM.
But the key element involved the 
way in which Microsoft propelled 
its Internet Explorer (IE) browser 
to leadership in a market that had 
been dominated by Netscapes 
Navigator. The trial heard that 
Microsoft not only gave away IE but 
also bundled it into its Windows 
operating system, forcing manufac
turers to pre-load it on to their com
puters. Microsoft swiftly succeeded 
in winning a half share in the 
browser market, and now domi
nates it.
Even if users wanted to use 
Navigator, the trial heard that its 
performance was not as quick, and 
that IE would be triggered as the 
default browser for a variety of 
functions. Microsoft also encour
aged Apple to pre-install Internet 
Explorer on its computers, even 
though it used a different operating 
system.
What was Microsofts 
defense?
It said it faced a great deal of 
competition and that its actions 
reflected that fact. The consumer 
also gained from its actions as they 
received a free Internet browser, 
when previously Netscape would 
charge for Navigator. The growth of 
the Internet, and mergers between 
rivals such as AOL and Netscape 
(and now AOL Time Warner) 
meant Microsoft did not have a 
monopoly position, it said.
What did the district judge 
in the first trial say?
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson 
ordered that Microsoft be split in 
two for abusing its dominant mar
ket position. He said the action was 
needed to ensure that the company 
did not operate as a monopoly. He 
also ordered Microsoft to modify its 
conduct to give its competitors a 
better chance of selling their own 
software.
Under this scenario, the compa
ny was to have been split into two 
separate businesses. One of the 
businesses would market and pro
duce operating systems and the 
other would handle applications 
software including Microsoft Office 
and the IE Web browser.
Judge Jackson had already ruled 
that Microsoft had broken anti
trust laws, abusing its dominant 
position in the computer operating 
system market. Microsofts busi
ness had been thought likely to be 
severely restricted by the courts 
remedies, which were designed to 
ensure that other companies could 
compete more effectively with the 
software giant.
The court further ordered 
Microsoft to modify its business 
behaviors including giving comput
er makers more flexibility in con
figuring their systems and in selling 
and promoting non-Microsoft soft
ware, and releasing technical infor
mation at the same time and equal
ly to other software vendors as it 
does to its own personnel.
Barring a settle
ment, the case is far 
from over.
Why did the deal fall apart?
While the US government has 
been actively involved in the anti
trust case, individual states have 
often been the forgotten partner. 
Though they have also maintained 
remarkable cohesion over the 
three-year process, settlement talks 
have often divided the states 
camps.. The states have consistent
ly pushed for the harshest remedies 
against the software giant, and 
some court watchers believe that it 
was the insistence by the states in 
last years settlement talks that led 
to its collapse.
Generally, states that came out 
against the settlement were the 
ones with technology companies 
that are indisposed to Microsoft, 
says Howard University law profes
sor Andrew Gavil. California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer said 
that he came to oppose the settle
ment after he spent the time listen
ing to technical experts from 
Microsoft competitors, including 
IBM, AOL Time Warner, Sun 
Microsystems, and Novell.
So what happens to the set
tlement  is that off?
No. The judge has established a 
two-track process for proceedings.
One track would follow the hear
ings required to approve the settle
ment. The other track would be a 
continuatidn of the anti-trust suit 
and could lead to remedy hearings 
next year. US Justice Department 
antitrust chief Charles James said 
that the settlement would serve as 
a baseline for any additional reme
dies. The judge could build on the 
settlement with the hopes that it 
might lure more states to settle and 
bring the case to a resolution.
What are the next steps in 
the court case?
The settlement always faced the 
judges review, and that process 
will begin as soon as Microsoft, the 
federal government and some of 
the states sign the settlement. That 
will begin a 60-day period of public 
comment followed by hearings. 
Before the states coalition splin
tered, legal experts had said that 
the judge was unlikely to reject the 
agreement, but with the states 
coalition split, experts say that the 
case is in uncharted legal territory 
with no clear precedents.
In addition to the settlement 
review, Judge Kollar-Kotelly has 
also set in motion the process for 
remedy hearings. She rejected a 
Microsoft motion that said the 
dissenting states lacked legal 
standing to proceed without the 
federal government. The judge 
had previously laid out a schedule 
for the remedy hearings process.
When can we expect the 
trial to end?
Some of the dissenting states 
have said that they are still open to 
a settlement, and the judge has 
stated her preference for a quick 
settlement of the case. The judge 
may suggest remedies during the 
hearings that could lure more 
states to sign off on a settlement, 
and legal experts say that the judge 
could suspend the remedy hearings 
phase if she believes the two sides 
are close to settling.
Barring a settlement, the case is 
far from over.

Divided We Fall 
Thursday, November 15
Foreign Thursday nights returns to us this week with Musime 
si Pomahat, or Divided We Fall. This movie, about WWII loyal
ties, will make you cry, laugh, become angry, rejoice, and soil 
yourself all at the same time. The story takes place in a 
Czechoslovakian town during Nazi occupation. It is the story of 
the villagers, their struggle, and their relationship with the 
Nazis. Its directed by Jan Hrebejk, a Czech director known for 
his intelligent writing and witty camera shots. This film is in 
Czech and German.
This movie is a sequel to a movie called United We Stand. Its 
about the rally of Americans behind FDR during WWII. 
Actually, this movie isnt a sequel to anything. I made it up. Just 
like I make everything up. It would be an interesting movie 
though, if it were a sequel. Most especially if it were the second 
in a trilogy. The second movie in a trilogy is always the most 
interesting. Take The Empire Strikes Back and Indiana Jones and 
the Temple of Doom. They are by far the best movies out of the 
three. The middle child syndrome doesnt exist for movies  
the middle one is always the best.
At 7:30 pm, 10 pm, and 12:30 am 
In McConomy Auditorium
Shrek 
Friday, November 16
Once upon a time, there was a green ogre. He didnt wash. He 
lived alone in the woods. He was a social outcast, befriended by 
no one and mocked by many. No, not the typical CS major, hes 
Shrek! This conglomeration of fairy tales was the best summer 
movie in a long time. Lord Farquaad, with the voice of John 
Lithgow, was hilarious. Especially the scene with the ginger
bread man. The entire movie is cleverly written and produced. 
Shrek 2 will come out in 2004. Itll be quite a feat to outdo 
Shrek 1.1 hope its not too contrived.
I often ponder this: If I were to be any fairy tale character, 
who would I be? I think Id choose Peter Pan. He could fly, he 
lived on a tropical island, and he stayed young forever. Im sure 
he could get any girl he wished as well. It would be a constant 
party, never any work. It would be all play, all the time. It 
would also be fun to be Prince Charming, for obvious reasons. 
Of all the female Disney characters, Sleeping Beauty is by far 
the prettiest heroine. Belle takes a close second, but far behind 
Sleeping Beauty.
At 6 pm, 8 pm, 10 pm, and 12 am 
In McConomy Auditorium
Osmosis Jones 
Saturday, November 17
The Farrelly Brothers succeed again here, in an unusual ani
mated effort. Bill Murray plays a disgusting zoo-keeper, whose 
ill health is of much concern to his daughter. This hilarious 
movie is half animated, and half live action. It has a star-studded cast, including David Hyde Pierce, Chris Rock, and 
Lawrence Fishburne. Bill Murrays body is attacked by a big bad 
virus named Thrax. Chris Rock and his pill-head sidekick, 
Pierce, try to stop Thrax, but end up causing Murray to do some 
pretty unusual stuff during the struggle.
This trend towards making more adult animated films is pret
ty successful. I personally like it, as the animated stuff market
ed towards kids doesnt have the same appeal towards adults as 
it used to. They dont have that timeless quality. I can still 
watch Aladdin and Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty with ease, but 
Mulan and Hercules grate on my nerves. Toy Story was a nice 
relief. It is definitely a kiddie movie, but there is more than 
enough adult humor. Most of all, its not inappropriate humor, 
just humor that goes over kids heads. I think Osmosis Jones 
belongs in this category. Its good. You should see it.
At 8 pm, 10 pm, and 12 am 
In McConomy Auditorium
Brainscan 
Sunday, November 18
Brainscan. Kill innocent victims. WOOHOOOOO! This 
reminds me of the show Are You Afraid of the Dark? on 
Nickelodeon. There was an episode where the kid loved video 
games, and got sucked into a real live video game. He had to 
break out of the mall and save the princess. It was a good 
episode. There was also the episode where the kid called the 
seven digit number, and was arrested by the phone police. That 
was a good episode as well. Maybe Brainscan will be like that.
If I remember correctly, there was also an episode where all of 
the characters spoke Pig Latin. I hinkte I illwe itewre histe rticlea nie igPe atinLe. I hinkte hatte oura ampusce houldse

I readily concede that I am not 
much of a movie buff. I rarely go 
to see movies while they are still 
in the theater, and when I do so, I 
have a consistent record of choos
ing the absolutely worst and 
dumbest ones available; for exam
ple, my favorite to date is A Night 
at the Roxbury. As I have demon
strated, it does not take all that 
much to please me, and the 
adorable new Disney cartoon 
Monsters, Inc. accomplished this 
task.
Monsters, Inc. had a monstrous
ly huge debut at the box office, 
setting the record in first week 
revenue for an animated film. It 
ousted previous-record holder Toy 
Story 2, which was also made by 
the team of Disney and Pixar 
Studios. Given such a quality team 
of proven talents, good things and 
justifiable success were likely to 
 ensue.
Dont be fooled by how this 
movie was released the week of 
Halloween; the monsters are not 
scary to the audience. They are 
hideously ugly, have pathetic 
hygiene (although using deodor
ant before a big date was quite 
funny), and are definitely not role 
models. Instead, they produce 
their scares strictly as a business 
matter. Monsters, Inc. is a corpo
ration that produces energy by 
causing children to scream. 
Employees of varying monster 
forms sneak into childrens closets 
during the night and frighten 
them. Its a dirty job, but when 
youre a multicolored, horny freak 
of nature, you may as well do it.
Ive always viewed the recruit
ment of stellar actors as superflu
ous in efforts to make a successful 
cartoon. Nevertheless, the cast 
includes several well-known 
names. John Goodman lends his 
voice to the protagonist, James 
Sulley Sullivan, while Sulkys 
assistant Michael Wazowski and

When David Mamet made his lat
est movie, Heist, he was by no 
means setting out to write a revolu
tionary script. In fact, audiences 
have seen various incarnations of 
the plot this year in films such as 
The Score. However, while much of 
the action in The Score focused on 
the planning, execution, and partic
ular details of the big'break-in, 
David Mamet shares relatively little 
about the thinking of Joe Moore, 
the movies main character (played 
by Gene Hackman).
Hackmans character Joe is an 
older thief who has apparently 
made his living by building boats 
and stealing precious metals and 
jewelry. The movie starts with Joe 
robbing a jewelry store with some 
of his equally aged colleagues. 
When Joes face is caught on video 
during the robbery, he vows to give
up his life of crime and flee the 
country. However, he is approached 
by Bergman, played by Danny 
DeVito, for one last job  the heist 
that the rest of the movie is focused 
on. Referred to simply as the Swiss 
Job by the characters (a simple 
name that typifies complex Mamet 
plots), the audience is left with few 
details of exactly what will tran
spire over the remaining 90 or so 
minutes of the movie. There are 
murmurs of passports, planes, 
trains, and vans, but little indica
tion of whether Joe and his cronies 
will be intercepting a train in the 
Swiss Alps, or stealing jewels from a 
bank in Switzerland.
When the plot eventually 
becomes clearer, the audience is 
constantly trying to figure out what 
Joe knows, and what he doesnt. 
Clearly he cant be anticipating all 
of the storys plot twists, but how 
many of his actions hes scoped out 
beforehand are unclear as Joes 
improvisation is seamlessly interSee HEIST, page B7
Reviewers disappointed by old favorite. Pasta Piatta
by Claire Jauregui
Copy Staff 
& Meredith Wiggins
Copy Staff
After a long day of proofreading and talking to 
ex-boyfriends, Meredith and Claire decided (well 
really it was Mers doing) that dinner out was just 
the thing to beat the Sunday night blues. Craving 
fat and hot busboys, they headed over to one of 
their old haunts, Pasta Piatto on Bellefonte 
Street. After parking in an overpriced lot, they 
entered what was once the epitome of fine Italian 
dining in the heart of Shadyside. At the foot of 
the stairs, they found that their favorite yellowshirt-wearing host was MIA. In his place was a 
younger, greasier Guido in a black cord shirt. 
Faux Pas. While waiting to be seated in the half
filled dining room, Claires sensitive nose was 
assaulted by the smell of body odor  or maybe it 
was mildew.

Rollins Nice maintains old anger, introduces new tunes
by Albert Cohen
Staffwriter
Liar! Cause Im a Liar! These are maybe the 
first words that come to mind when you think of 
Henry Rollins, the musician. Or perhaps you 
have heard of Black Flag, the baddest punk band 
in the land in its heyday. Maybe youve checked 
out some of his other solo stuff, such as the more 
recent Come in and Burn or even Get Some Go 
Again. But most MTV watchers are going to 
remember him forever as the red-faced 
devil/polite policeman screaming his head off in 
the video for Liar.
Regardless of where you saw or heard Rollins 
rant and scream, your first impression would be 
that he is eternally pissed off with a penchant for 
anger. Well, yeah. Ive only had the chance to 
check out his more recent non-spoken word 
(more on that later) records, and as a hard 
rock/metal fan, I love 'em. Theres plenty of 
anger and satirical lyrics backed by a crack band 
of musicians that know how to kick out the jams. 
(Check out Get Some Go Again for guest appear-, 
ances from members of MC5 and Thin Lizzy.)
Thats not to say that there hasnt been an evo
lution from album to album. Long-time fans will 
notice that this is now the second album with a 
new backing band, the LA-based Mother 
Superior. In fact, the biggest change Ive noticed 
with Mother Superior is the addition of a blues 
feel to the music, which compliments the hard 
rock riffing Ive come to expect. Overall, the
sound is a lot bigger. Id say that age has maybe 
allowed Hank to loosen up a bit and experiment 
a bit with the sounds that he has in the back
ground, the best example being I Want So 
Much More, which features gospel backing 
singers and spaced out guitar noodling. Theres 
even some saxophone if you hardcore fans arent 
pissed off yet.
But these are all additions, not distractions, to 
what youve come to expect from a Rollins Band 
album. Hello starts out with Hello! Hello 
darkness, and pain.... and then after a bit of 
screaming we slide into a blues jam that stands 
alongside anything that Ive heard Guns n Roses 
insert into their work. Whats the Matter, 
Man? has that get-up-and-go groove Ive come 
to love from this guy, simply because behind all 
the screaming is a view that, with all that is 
wrong with this world, we can change things by 
starting from within.
Other tracks that stand out include We Walk 
Alone, which has grungy Sabbath-y rumble 
behind it and the jazz number that closes out the 
album, Let That Devil Out that also gets a 
blues groove going.
Overall, this is an album that will please and 
surprise old fans and hopefully attract new ones. 
Now, as far as Henry Rollins, the spoken word 
artist, is concerned, this is one show you simply 
can not miss. I have had the good fortune of pay
ing 30 dollars plus four times, already to catch 
his show, and laughed for three hours through 
each time. This is a man covered in muscles and 
tattoos who  with insight and self-deprecating
charm  can unravel all of the things that con
cern mankind, from the mundane to what oth
ers would have you see as important. If you were 
lucky enough to score tickets to tonights (soldout) free show at the McConomy Auditorium, 
well, voure in for a real treat!

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 12, 2001
4.: v
Crunchy, bumpy, lumpy  
is this really what I ordered?
PASTA, from page B6
After Guido escorted the girls 
to the worst table in the restau
rant, they were surprised to see 
new menus placed before them. 
Different from the map-like 
menus of earlier days that just 
never seemed to fold up correct
ly, this menu resembled a book 
 with a few pages missing. 
Meredith was shocked, horrified 
even, to discover that her 
favorite dish, the cheese tortelli
ni and tomato cream sauce, was 
no longer available. In its 
absence she opted to order the 
Ortaglia, an orgasmic favorite 
made by God himself. She sali
vated just thinking about the 
generous serving of angel hair 
pasta smothered in a rich tomato 
sauce tossed with spinach, julienned carrots, celery, and zuc
chini ($14.95 including soup or 
salad). To compliment her 
entre, Mer eagerly chose the 
salad with the house dressing 
and Gorgonzola cheese, another 
long-time favorite. Claire, 
jonesing for something different, 
decided to try the Italian 
Wedding Soup and the Fettuccini 
Carbonara ($14.95).
As they waited for their soup 
and salad, they enjoyed bread, 
sweet butter, parmesan cheese, 
and ice cold water. Since they 
hadnt visited the Piatto since 
July, they were anxious to see one 
of their favorite waiters, former 
pro wrestler and ladies man, 
Andre the Giant. However, it 
seemed that the management had 
responded to possible complaints 
that there wasnt enough T&A in 
the dining room. Goodbye Andre,i 
hello Amber! And wasnt she a 
piece of work. It was obviously a 
bad night for Amber as she had no 
personality or time for Meredith 
and Claire. Anticipation and 
thirst ran high as the busboy 
refilled their glasses one, two, 
three times before Amber finally 
showed up with a crisp salad for 
Mer and an Italian Wedding in a 
bowl for Claire.
While Mer went ninja on her 
salad, Claire approached her soup 
with a little less enthusiasm. The
soups so-called chicken took the 
form and texture of the egg in egg 
drop soup. Claire tentatively 
sipped the broth, finding it rich in 
flavor and in unidentifiable meat 
products. Food eradicator that 
she is, Meredith slurped down 
most of those items in question 
until she noticed small white balls 
floating in remaining broth. 
Recoiling suddenly, she told 
Claire there were balls in the 
soup. With much speculation as 
to the origins of the ingredients, 
the soup was pushed to the edge 
of the table and the girls finished 
off Mers salad, sparring over 
every last lettuce leaf and deli
cious piece of cheese.
As they expectantly waited for 
their pasta, Mer and Claire shared 
their mutual disdain for men who 
still wore sweaters from the 80s. 
Just when they thought things 
couldnt get any worse, the entrees 
arrived. Diving into her ortaglia, 
Meredith found it to be runny, 
watery even  perfect for swim
ming, but lacking its usual robust 
taste. The vegetables, while fresh, 
were a mite undercooked, causing 
Mer severe molar discomfort. 
Across the table, Claire had 
crunchy carbonara to contend 
with. Wanting to make the best of 
the meal, Claire approached the 
leather-like carbonara with a posi
tive attitude, only to find the sauce 
lumpy (most likely due to not 
enough whisking of the cream and 
cheese over too high a flame) and 
overly saturated by the taste of 
bacon.
Despite high expectations 
before the meal, the bread and 
butter proved to be the best part 
of Claire and Mers dining experi
ence. And while they took home 
sizable portions for reheating, the 
quality of service, food, and 
atmosphere were seriously lack
ing in light of the $32 bill. Pasta 
Piatto has seen better days, but 
Claire and Mer will always 
remember the good old days, 
when reheated Pasta Piatto, Phil 
Lesh, and Bob Dylan made for a 
memorable night.
Final Grade: CRefreshments 
will be served.
New David Mamet film Heist reveals incredible script 
and dialogue, not seen in typical movies in his genre
HEIST, from page B6
woven into his predetermined game plan. Unlike 
most movies in this genre, the audience is actu
ally left wondering if the Joe and his colleagues 
are incredibly brilliant, or just plain lucky 
because of the fluidity of the story line.
What is also different about Mamets Heist as 
compared to other films in the genre is the 
incredible script and its dialogue that serve as 
the great underpinning for the film. Besides the 
actors themselves, the focal point of the film is 
not the action scenes, but the words. Mamet
Courtesy of Warner Bros.
truly has a gift for writing, and to be able to write 
an eloquent script for an action film is brilliant. 
Few can write long exchanges about the Swiss 
Job and the thing with such imprecision as 
Mamet does and actually get away with it. This is 
one action film that you can actually leave feel
ing more overwhelmed by the dialogue than the 
action.
With so much already going for it, the movie 
becomes a must-see with the addition of Gene 
Hackman and Danny DeVito. The roles that the 
two are cast in could not be more appropriate. 
DeVitos interpretation of Bergman as a sleazy 
crime boss is amazing as he scurries around the 
screen in cheap colorful suits and a black leather 
jacket muttering typical bad-guy talk in dialogue 
that is anything but typical  Mamets words 
coming out of DeVitos mouth are remarkable. 
Hackmans performance, though, is the showstopper. Mamets character Joe is so calm, col
lected, eloquent, and sure-witted that only Gene 
Hackman could have pulled off the role.
Heist is different  it is an action film, but its 
also a drama with great actors and a brilliant 
script. David Mamet has proved once again his 
versatility, approaching what could easily be 
considered a tired genre with wit, style, and 
innovation.

nemesis Randall Boggs are voiced by 
Billy Crystal, and oft-villain Steve 
Buscemi, respectively.
Sulley is the supreme scarer, chasing 
the all-time scare-record alongside 
Randall the sinister chameleon. Sulkys 
roar is obnoxiously frightening, but he is 
portrayed as a sweet and sensitive gendeman in real life. One night, when he 
goes to retrieve paperwork for 
Wazowski, a human child accidentally 
escapes into the monster world. The lit
tle girl just cant be eradicated by the 
time Sulley grows attached to her and 
names her Boo, perhaps the prettiest 
name for a little girl other than Urethra 
or Chlamydia. Sulley and Wazowski 
attempt to hide her, but their environ
ment is one where she is seen as poten
tially toxic and thus unwelcome. 
Through a battle with Randall and 
other opponents, they attempt to return 
her to the human world.
Monsters, Inc. even has funny 
moments for older kids (i.e. college stu

term memory has left and recognize 
their existence only in the distant past,

hend for a full five seconds.
If you dont have strong desires to go 
see a G-rated movie, even one with a 
joke about yellow snow, you should 
realize that everyone else is doing it, 
so why not you? At the very least, I 
beseech you to check out the brief pre
ceding cartoon. Its nonsensical, but 
depicts a gargantuan birds struggle to 
conform to the liking of the chirping 
minute ones. Monsters, Inc. is fun for 
the entire family, so go see it over 
Thanksgiving vacation if you refuse to 
associate with Disney in front of your 
peers. With a fun time guaranteed, 
you really dont have a reason not to 
see it  unless of course you are 
scared of the big bad monsters.

Original Wizard of Oz
Munchkins Go on Tour
CONCORD, N.C. (AP)  
Jerry Maren, who got his 
start in the movies playing a 
Munchkin in the movie The 
Wizard of Oz, had no idea he 
would be talking about the 
film more than 60 years 
later.
I thought it was a typical 
Metro Goldwyn Mayer musi
cal, the 4 3 1/4 actor com
mented.
His role as a Munchkin 
quickly proved to be anything 
but ordinary, and Maren, now 
81, parlayed the part into a 
long acting career.
Maren  whose signature 
song welcomed an awe-struck 
Dorothy to Munchkinland  
spent Thursday afternoon in 
the Concord Mills mall food 
court, signing autographs for 
a grinning public who came to 
see him. He will be there 
through Monday, reliving 
memories of Oz.
A movie talent scout 
approached Maren during the 
Three Steps and One Half 
dance show in Hartford, 
Conn., saying: We need a lot 
of little guys like you.
After the musical, Maren 
played Little Oscar, the 
worlds smallest chef, for the 
Oscar Mayer sausage compa
ny. He has appeared in films 
ranging from the Marx 
Brothers At the Circus (1939) 
to Mel Brooks Spaceballs 
(1987).
Hes earned enough for a 
comfortable, custom-fitted 
house in the rolling 
Hollywood Hills.
Maren is among seven 
MuPchkins who travel the 
country on the appearance cir
cuit. Theyre among the 10 
remaining of the 124 original 
Munchkins still living; three 
others are in nursing homes 
and unable to travel.

 cant do it much longer. The incontinence alone is too 
much to bear. I simply cannot maintain my invariants 
under the weekly strain of Comics Editor. I need an assis

hubris and solipsist bent, email dwindlehop@cmu.edu. Do 
you have any idea how tough it is to get Comics staff to 
listen to you when youre wearing adult diapers? I doubt it.

Somehow I managed to finagel my way onto the show and within 
five minutes had won the cash. Soon the problem was discovered 
and Regis' reaction unit was suitably randomized, but the 
damage had already been done.
I decided to invest the money 
into the creation of a fully 
self-sufficient submarine. A 
special intake valve with 
pulverizer attachment provided 
a nutritious seafood slurry, 
sustaining its crew indefinitely
^ro+Tgcf ctnd Pwrcli&sfiThe crew's continuing mission: to purge*the world of all that 
impeded the free flow of 
capital amongst mutually

After a decade we had eliminated 
all socialism aside from a 
single island utopia, which 
defended its backward ways with 
a government-funded laser tower.
But with us dumping wave after wave of flashy electronics, freedom eventually prevailed.

SO MANY THINGS TO CELEBRATE IN NOVEMBER!
Sleep Comfort Month
If sleep is a distant memory, how about comfortable sleep? If your professor 
gets mad about the gallons of drool youve left in the classroom, you can plead 
sleep comfort all month!
Peanut Butter Lovers Month

arachibutyrophobics. Best not to be one of those this month. Instead, be sure 
to head to your local grocery store and pick up a jar of Jif.
Shallow Persons Awareness Week
2nd week of November
Dig it. Hip. Watch out for those shallow people who just dont grok.
Cook Something Bold and Pungent Day
November 8
Hope you already cooked something outrageous, because if you havent, then 
youll need to get a license for next year.
Buffalo on the Block Day
November 18
In South Dakota, theyre auctioning off hundreds of surplus buffalo today. If 
you get one, you can make buff jerkey.
Sinkie Day
November 24
Join the Sinkies in your life today and eat a meal over your kitchen sink. If 
you have a sink. Hmm. Or a kitchen.
Red Planet Day
November 28
Launch a successful mission of your own on the day commemorating 1964s 
first successful mission to Mars.
Call in Well Day
