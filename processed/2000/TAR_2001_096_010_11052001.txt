Not on our turf: Pitt asks 
vendors to leave campus
AFTER CAMPUS, COMMUNITY OUTCRY, OFFICIALS 
SAY VENDORS WILL RETURN BY THANKSGIVING
by Sonni Abatta
Staffwriter
Students in the Oakland commu
nity can often be seen stopping by 
the outdoor vendors on the 
University of Pittsburgh campus 
that sell books, jewelry, clothing, 
and posters, among other goods 
and services. Last Tuesday, Pitt stu
dents and vendors received the 
news that with the exception of 
one stand that sells University 
clothing, all vendors at Pitt have 
been ordered off campus. 
Suddenly and without publicized 
reason, Pitts administration decid
ed to reconsider its policy of allow
ing non-University-affiliated ven
dors to pay a daily charge for a 
place on campus.
According to Pitt spokesperson 
Robert Hill, Pitt has allowed about 
200 vendors to be on campus dur
ing the past 20 years. During warm 
weather, 12 to 15 vendors arrive on 
campus each day. Reasons given by 
Pitt for the removal of vendors 
include the competition that ven
dors pose to University-owned 
stores and an incident of counter
feit merchandise being sold by a 
vendor earlier this fall. A city ordi
nance enacted last year that for
bids vendors from selling goods on 
some city streets was also cited by 
Pitt administrators, although city 
officials have said that the ordi
nance would not pertain to the 
vendors on Pitts campus.
Some Pitt students say that there 
has been no justification for the 
administrations decision. The 
administration did not consult
with any [of] the student body 
about this decision and they wont 
even give us a full explanation 
about why, instead choosing to cite 
some vague reference to a law 
passed last year that none of [us] 
can even look up, said Maher 
Hoque, a senior information sys
tems major at Pitt. Hows that for 
an open dialog with your paying 
customers.
Students will lose the cheap 
prices that the street vendors offer 
compared to other stores in the 
Oakland area. Many [students] 
will miss the opportunity to buy 
cut-rate posters, movies, books, 
and jewelry. Since the campus dri
ves prices up so high in nearby 
stores, it was always kind of nice to 
bargain shop on the Union lawn, 
said Jon Washburn, a sophomore 
biomedical engineering major at 
Pitt.
On Saturday, Pitt attempted to 
clarify and modify their ban on 
outdoor vendors. Hill said that Pitt 
administrators wanted to establish 
a policy procedure for vendors to 
ensure the quality of the products 
students purchased. He also said 
that some administrators had been 
concerned about the appearance of 
the vendors stands, claiming that 
some looked rickety. Were com
peting with major universities all 
over the country, and the physical 
facilities, the atmosphere, the 
attractiveness of the physical envi
ronment is an issue, said Hill. 
With input from students, a group 
of administrators will now develop 
new vendor guidelines that are 
expected to be completed by

Universities around the country 
may soon struggle to maintain their 
diversity pending the proposal and 
passage of California Senator 
Dianne Feinsteins bill to deny visas 
to students from countries alleged 
to harbor terrorists. Feinsteins pro
posal of a six-month student visa 
moratorium comes in the wake of 
the terrorist attacks on the World 
Trade Center and Pentagon. In an 
announcement last Thursday, 
Feinstein said that the legislation 
was necessary after the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation disclosed 
last week that Hani Hanjour and 
Mohamed Atta, two of the suspect
ed September 11 hijackers, entered 
the country on student visas.
Some international students 
have expressed concern and voiced 
frustration at the proposed legisla
tion. One CMU student, who asked 
to remain anonymous, said, What 
really concerns me is that if I go 
. home during winter break, will I be 
refused reentry to the country? 
According to the common feeling 
. back home, if there is a reassess
ment of student visas at any point, 
can a student holding a valid five 
year visa be denied entry at the air
port and returned home without
completing their studies?
Kavita Arora, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major 
and the president of the 
International Students Union at 
CMU does not think that the new 
regulations will adversely affect the 
University. She believes that inter
national students applying to 
Carnegie Mellon  which has an 
international reputation as a strong 
academic institute  will have a 
greater chance of being accepted 
into the school and of obtaining a 
visa than students who apply to 
schools with lower academic stand
ing. If one applies and is accepted 
to a college of lesser standing than 
Carnegie Mellon, they will run the 
risk of not getting a visa, said 
Arora. She added that some inter
national students are concerned 
that their younger siblings who 
want to study in the US will be 
adversely restricted by future legis
lation.
John Keeley, a research assistant 
at the Center for Immigration 
Studies, a Washington think tank, 
noted that in 1999-2000, 3,000 stu
dent visas were given to individuals 
from nations on the State 
Department list of countries that 
sponsor terrorist activity. We need 
to assess whether any student visas 
should be given to terrorist-watch

Students question lack of 
information after attack

Some students feel as though they 
never leave the computer clusters. 
When deadlines are near, sleep and 
recreation are not options for busy 
students hunched over cluster 
machines. However, thanks to a 
recent student government initia
tive, students wont need to interrupt 
work in order to cast their votes in 
the upcoming Student Senate elec
tion.
Online voting is something that 
Internal Affairs has had as a goal for 
some time, explained Quinten 
Steenhuis, a sophomore philosophy 
major and the chairman for Student 
Governments Internal Affairs com
mittee and a Senator for H&SS. The 
advantage is dear: voter turnout has 
increased at every school online 
elections have been implemented at. 
It is easier to participate and to make 
it to the polls on time. Last semester, 
less than one fourth of Carnegie 
Mellon students participated in the 
Student Senate elections, and about 
one tenth participated in elections 
for student body president and vice 
president. Another prospective 
advantage of online elections is 
faster vote counting. Election results 
would be available almost immedi
ately after the polls closed.
The online voting system, referred 
to as phpSGVote, is a modified ver
sion of a program first created at the 
Rochester Institute of Technology. 
Votes will be anonymous, although
the system will keep track of which 
students have voted. Students will 
still have the option of casting their 
votes in person. In order to avoid 
double-counting, poll workers will 
use a database to verify that students 
who vote in person have not already 
voted online.
Senate acquired the system in the 
Spring of 2001, but only started 
working on it during the end of 
August. According to Steenhuis, just 
two tests have been performed on the 
full Carnegie Mellon system. The 
most recent was comprised of 35 stu
dents, or under one percent of the 
undergraduate population at CMU. 
Steenhuis said that the students were 
self-selected after Senate posted mes
sages misc.market. Steenhuis said 
that the number of students involved 
in the test, because Senate only 
expected approximately 350 stu
dents to actually vote.
Further, while Senate approved 
use of an online system last spring, 
no decision was made about use of a 
system in the fall elections until last 
night in a late evening Executive 
Committee meeting. Currently, the 
system is housed on a mid-range PC 
in the Student Senate office on the 
third floor of the University Center in 
a secure area. According to members 
of the Executive Committee, they 
believe that the system is secure and 
that there will be no problems when 
the system goes online this week.
Online voting has been in the 
works for the past several semesters, 
and was nearly implemented last 
spring. Unfortunately, at the last 
minute, there was a problem with 
our service provider, said Brian 
Namey, an ethics, history, and public 
policy major junior and student body 
vice president. Namey said that the 
successful implementation of the 
system could have a highly positive 
effect upon student voter participa
tion at CMU. Voter turnout at camShaina McGrath/Photo Co-Editor
On November 6 and 7, student voters will be able to participate in Senate elec
tions online. Student Government members, including Brian Namey, Student Body 
Vice President, have worked on the online voting system for several semesters.
puses across the country has 
increased from single digits to as 
much as 95 percent when online vot
ing was introduced. We hope 
Carnegie Mellon will have similar 
results, said Namey.
Online voting may boost student 
participation, but its possible nega
tive implications have caused debate 
among some students. Online elec
tions are a very bad idea, com
mented Jesse Melat, a sophomore 
English major. I can just picture 
them getting hacked. Unfortunately, 
even if the systems security is not 
violated, anyone who steals a stu
dents Andrew password can cast 
that students vote for her or him.
Internal Affairs claims it has dealt 
with possible security issues. The 
system uses strong security, says 
Steenhuis. Attempts to disable or 
circumvent the security will be 
logged. After conducting a test that 
lasted from October 29 to October 
31, Student Senate feels ready to put
the computerized voting system into 
action.
Under the current Student 
Government voting system, approxi
mately one half of Student Senate 
positions open for election every 
semester. Student Senators for each 
college are elected by undergradu
ates from their respective colleges. 
The president, vice president, and 
treasurer are elected in the spring by 
the entire student body. The polls for 
Student Senate positions will be 
open November 6 and 7 for this falls 
elections. Students can cast their 
votes online at
http://elections. andrew. emu. edu.
For our system of student govern
ment to work most effectively, it 
requires broad participation, said 
Namey. It is our hope that online 
voting will facilitate the democratic 
process. As one of the most techni
cally advanced institutions in the 
world, it is surprising online voting 
was not established long ago.

US offers to advise ally 
Pakistan on nuclear arms
. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP)  
Concerned that Osama bin Laden 
is seeking to get his hands on 
nuclear weapons, the United States 
has dropped its punitive measures 
against Pakistans nuclear program 
and is now offering to advise the 
country on securing its stockpile.
. The Americans spent a decade 
sanctioning Pakistan for building 
nuclear weapons, but that policy 
effectively changed with the 
September 11 terror attacks on the 
United States.
* The United States now views 
Pakistan as an essential ally in the 
war against terrorism. The 
Americans want to cooperate with 
Pakistan on nuclear issues to 
ensure that no nuclear material 
leaks to bin Ladens al-Qaida net
work or comes under the control of 
Islamic fundamentalists inside 
Pakistan.
 President Bush lifted economic 
sanctions originally imposed in 
1990 by his father. And when 
Secretary of State Colin Powell 
arrived last month, he went a step 
further, proposing that the United 
States provide training for 
Pakistans nuclear facilities.
During his visit, Colin Powell 
offered us that kind of support, to 
train Pakistanis in America on the 
safeguarding of nuclear installa
tions, said Pakistani Foreign 
Minister Abdul Sattar.
Neither Pakistan nor the United 
States has released details. But the 
Offer is believed to include training 
on everything from preventing 
accidents at civilian power plants 
to guarding against the theft of 
Weapons-grade uranium, said 
Rifaat Hussain, head of the depart
ment of defense and strategic stud
ies at Quaid-i-Azam University in 
Islamabad.
 Powell, speaking Wednesday in 
Washington, said Pakistani 
President Pervez Musharraf 
understands the importance of 
ensuring that all elements of his 
nuclear program are safe and 
secure. y
Musharraf knows that if he 
needs any technical assistance in 
how to improve that security level, 
-we would be more than willing to 
help in any way that we can, 
Powell added.
The shift in US policy does not 
mean American concerns about 
Pakistans nuclear program have 
eased. If anything, the United 
'States may be more worried than 
ever about an arsenal that includes 
an estimated 20 to 30 warheads. 
Pakistan has never said how many 
'Weapons it has.
' The Americans have three big 
Concerns about Pakistani nuclear 
weapons: the spread of nuclear 
material to terrorist groups, the
prospect of Islamic fundamental
ists taking power in Pakistan, and 
the fear of a nuclear war between 
Pakistan and archrival India.
Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld said Thursday that bin 
Ladens network has been trying 
for years to acquire weapons of 
mass destruction.
Rumsfeld named no countries. 
However, speculation has focused 
on Pakistan, which until the 
September 11 attack had backed 
Afghanistans ruling Taliban move
ment, which in turn has harbored 
bin Laden.
Theres also a widespread belief 
that the former Soviet Union, with 
its widely scattered nuclear pro
gram, impoverished scientists and 
soldiers, and often lax security, 
would be the best place to look for 
a stolen nuke.
Yossef Bodansky, a former con
sultant to the US State and Defense 
Departments and author of Bin 
Laden, the Man who Declared War 
on America, wrote that bin Laden 
has tried but failed to acquire 
weapons of mass destruction in 
several parts of the former Soviet 
Union, including Russia, 
Kazakstan, Ukraine, and 
Chechnya.
Politics are turbulent in Pakistan, 
but the country has kept a tight lid 
on nuclear materials and technolo
gy since it launched the program in 
the mid-1970s, noted Hussain, the 
analyst.
He said Pakistan is proud of 
being the only Islamic country to 
build nuclear bombs, and has 
rebuffed efforts by other Islamic 
countries, including Iran and 
Libya, to acquire technology and 
material.
Last week, Pakistan arrested two 
retired nuclear scientists, Sultan 
Bashir-ud-Din Mehmood and 
Abdul Majid. But the government 
insisted they were being ques
tioned about alleged pro-Taliban 
sympathies, not about passing on 
nuclear secrets. Both were 
released, but a presidential 
spokesman said they were called in 
again Saturday for Questioning.
Pakistans history of military 
coups has raised fears that Islamic 
fundamentalists in the officer 
corps,could someday seize power, 
thereby gaining control over 
Pakistans nukes.
Musharraf, who came to power in 
his own coup two years ago, recent
ly purged the senior military ranks 
of officers viewed as Islamic funda
mentalists. Five of the top 14 offi
cers were moved to lesser positions.
Islamic parties have been staging 
noisy street protests against 
Musharrafs decision to abandon 
the Taliban and side with the 
United States.
North Ireland lawmakers try to maintain 
unified Catholic-Protestant legislature
BELFAST, Northern Ireland 
(AP)  Under British pressure, a 
handful of neutral politicians 
agreed Saturday to join the 
Protestant voting bloc in 
Northern Irelands legislature, a 
bid to outpower hard-line law
makers and save the provinces 
unity government.
The reluctant decision by the 
Alliance Party, which represents 
both moderate Catholics and 
Protestants, freed the way for a 
second legislative vote Monday  
three days after Protestant 
extremists defeated David 
Trimbles reelection as govern
ment leader.
Catholics backed Trimble in the 
first vote Friday but a narrow 
majority of his fellow Protestants 
voted against him. They dont 
want the coalition to include the 
Irish Republican Army-linked 
Sinn Fein party.
The longtime absence of a first 
minister has pushed the powersharing government, the hardestwon achievement of the 1998 
Good Friday peace agreement, to 
the brink of collapse.
The deadline to fill Trimbles 
pivotal post  or suffer the col
lapse or suspension of the joint 
Catholic-Protestant legislature  
was Saturday.
However Britain, in negotia
tions all day Saturday, proved 
unwilling to let a minority of lawmakers wreck the CatholicProtestant administration. It con
siders the nearly two-year-old 
coalition to be Northern Irelands 
best hope of forging peace after 
three decades of bloodshed that 
left 3,600 dead.
Britains top Northern Ireland 
official, John Reid, praised what 
he called the brave decision by 
Alliance, a party too small to 
merit posts in the four-party 
administration. Reid said the 
108-member Assembly would 
reconvene Monday to re-elect 
Trimble leader.
About an hour after Reid spoke, 
a bomb exploded in the back of 
an abandoned car in central 
Birmingham, Britains secondlargest city. There were no seri
ous injuries. Anti-terrorist detec
tives, citing a coded telephone 
warning and the nature of the 
attack, blamed an outlawed antiBritish group called the Real IRA.
Recognizing that a possible 
legal fight loomed with 
Protestant hard-liners who won 
Fridays vote, Reid said that after 
agonizing consultations with 
lawyers, it was determined that 
enabling Mondays vote would 
not require Britain to strip power 
temporarily from the local admin
istration.
In recent months, Reid had 
twice ordered one-day suspen
sions of power to postpone deadlines for electing a new first min
ister following Trimbles resigna
tion last July, when the Ulster 
Unionist chief vowed to return 
only after the IRA started to dis
arm.
The Alliance move would tilt 
the balance of power back in favor 
of Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize 
laureate who leads the biggest 
Protestant party, the Ulster 
Unionists. Barring further rebel
lion within his own party ranks,, 
he would return to power and the 
four-party coalition would sur
vive after several months of insta
bility.
If there is any message which 
should go out, it is that the 
Alliance Party is working to save 
the agreement, said Alliance 
leader David Ford.
Ford declined to specify how 
many of the five would declare 
themselves Protestant, but said as 
part of the deal they would be 
allowed to resume their neutral 
status within the week.
The major hard-line Protestant 
party, Ian Paisleys Democratic 
Unionists, protested that Britain 
was behaving illegally and that 
Mondays scheduled vote would 
be invalid.
Democratic Unionist leaders 
vowed to file a lawsuit against 
Britain. They demanded all sides 
respect Fridays vote, when

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES  A 
University of California-Los 
Angeles student is bringing a civil 
suit against members of the Sigma 
Pi fraternity for its alleged role in 
his drunk driving accident follow
ing a party last year.
Fifth-year history student Robert 
Burgess claims his accident result
ed from members of Sigma Pi forc
ing him to drink large volumes of 
alcohol and then returning his car 
keys to him while he was still 
drunk.
On the morning of November 4, 
2000, Burgess said he crashed his 
1997 Toyota Camry into a retaining 
wall and suffered a broken collar
bone, fractured wrist, and bleeding 
in his kidney. At the hospital, his 
blood-alcohol content was mea
sured at .19 percent  two and a 
half times the legal limit, he added.
Daniel Stimpert, Burgesss attor
ney, said members of Sigma Pi are 
at fault for violating fraternity, uni
versity and state laws that prohibit 
hazing activities.
Were going after the people 
who are responsible for what hap
pened, Stimpert said.
The complaint was filed with the 
Los Angeles Superior Court on 
October 4. No trial date has been 
set. Burgess said he never contact
ed police about the incident.
Mike Sporty, the president of
Sigma Pi at UCLA and one of the 
members named in the case, said 
neither he nor anyone in the frater
nity would discuss the situation 
while the investigation is ongoing.
Jeff Brown, William Elmer, and 
Allen Rowin are members of Sigma 
Pi named in the case along with 
Sporty. Brown and Elmer would 
not comment on the case, and 
Rowin could not be reached for 
comment after repeated phone 
calls to his current residence in 
Spain.
The Chi Omega sorority is also 
named in the lawsuit for allegedly 
adding to Burgesss personal 
humiliation, degradation and 
embarrassment. The Chi Omega 
president, Nicole Walker, said 
Tuesday she was not aware of the 
lawsuit and later said she is not 
worried about her sororitys 
involvement.
Burgess, who pledged Sigma Pi in 
fall 2000 after transferring to UCLA 
from Los Angeles Valley College, 
drove to the fraternity house for a 
fraternity event  Big Sis 
Revelation Night  the evening 
before his accident, according to the 
lawsuit. There, he was given three 
options: drink alcohol, drink a non
alcoholic beverage concocted by 
members of the fraternity, or find 
another fraternity to pledge. The suit 
said that members promised to
house him for the night if he chose to 
drink.
After choosing to drink alcohol, 
Sporty took Burgesss car keys from 
him, according to the suit.
Then members of the fraternity 
allegedly blindfolded him and led 
him around the house, urging him to 
drink in each room, the suit claims. 
At one point, while blind-folded, 
people allegedly held his arms down 
and poured alcohol in his mouth, 
Burgess said. The suit also stated 
that members of Chi Omega 
grabbed Burgess and wrote on his 
body in permanent marker without 
his consent.
Burgess said his last memory of 
the evening involves lying on a bed, 
drunk, with Elmer assigned to watch 
over him. I sat down on the bed, 
and thats the last thing I remember. 
I woke up and was being pushed in a 
gurney in the Medical Center, 
Burgess said. According to the suit, 
Burgess arose at some point in the 
evening, was handed his car keys by 
members of Sigma Pi and permitted 
to drive home.
Were currently investigating 
what the facts are, Briscoe said. 
Briscoe added that if the UCLA 
chapter broke any state laws, it had 
also violated the international 
organizations policies. The organi
zation would then bring sanctions 
against the individual chapter.
port from Catholic and neutral 
politicians  but lost because of a 
30-29 split on the Protestant 
benches.
Electing a leader requires majori
ty support from Catholic and 
Protestant camps within the 108- 
seat legislature, while the neutrals 
votes carry no influence.
Trimble sought re-election after 
the IRAs decision last week to 
begin getting rid of weapons. But 
many Protestants sought to block 
Trimble anyway  the only means, 
they calculated, to wreck a coali
tion that to their dismay includes 
the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.
Democratic Unionist lawmaker 
Nigel Dodds, who is also a 
Cabinet minister, said Fridays 
defeat of Trimble meant Britain 
was obliged to dissolve the legis
lature and call a new election.
Rather than going for fresh 
elections, which are now 
required, they are trying to rig 
the system and find some way of 
getting David Trimble back into 
government by the back door, 
said Dodds, whose uncompromis
ing party expects to gain at 
Trimbles expense in any future 
Northern Ireland-wide election.
Trimbles defeat Friday demon
strated that despite the IRAs dis
armament move, Paisley retained 
a voting bloc strong enough to 
create a government gridlock 
indefinitely.
Ehime Maru 
familes go 
to Hawaii
HONOLULU (AP)  The Navy 
spent $102,000 to fly in the fam
ilies of nine men and boys killed 
when their Japanese fishing ves
sel was struck by a US subma
rine.
Each of the nine families was 
told the Navy would pay for up to 
five family members. The Navy 
has paid for 36 airline round-trip 
tickets and up to two hotel rooms 
per family for no more than eight 
nights. Each family was also 
given $100 phone cards.
The figures released Friday by 
the Navy include the $2,500 
allotted to each family to cover 
funeral services and cremation.
The Navy also spent $60 mil
lion in the effort to recover the 
remains. The Ehime Maru ship 
was raised from a depth of 2,000 
feet and moved 16 miles to shal
low waters off the Honolulu 
Airport, where Navy divers 
recovered the eight bodies.
The search for the remaining 
victim, Takeshi Mizuguchi, 17, is 
expected to continue through 
the week, the Navy said. Still 
pending are other claims filed by 
the families and survivors, and 
another by the Ehime Prefecture 
in western Japan for a replace
ment vessel.

Thanksgiving. At that point, vendors 
will be permitted to return to cam
pus under the new rules, said Hill.
According to Neal Binstock, 
the assistant vice president of 
Business Services at Carnegie 
Mellon, the University has no
intention of removing vendors 
from campus. Binstock said that 
the vendors are a good resource 
for the campus community. 
CMU generally supports a free 
market economy  competition

vendors] as a negative thing.

They provide a good set of ser
vices to students. Vendors at 
Carnegie Mellon currently must 
apply for permits to sell their 
products on campus, and 
Binstock said that policies per
taining to on-campus vendors 
will remain unchanged.

Proposed legislation could limit number

nations, said Keeley. We need to 
start thinking about what limits 
should be placed on certain fields 
of study for international students 
and making sure that these stu
dents show up and are studying on 
the campus.
Senator Feinstein, together with 
Arizona Senator Jon Kyi, is also 
pushing for the federal govern
ment to stop awarding student 
visas to the residents of seven 
countries that the State 
Department considers to be spon
sors of terrorism: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and 
Syria. According to Feinstein, one 
immigrant who entered on a stu
dent visa from Iraq earned a doc
torate from the University of 
Michigan in Nuclear Studies, then 
traveled back to Iraq to become the 
head of the countrys nuclear divi
sion. Senator Feinstein says that 
what had originally started as a 
procedure to train international 
students who were to then return 
to their home countries has turned 
into a side-door for permanent 
immigration and terrorism. 
Without an adequate tracking sys
tem, our country becomes a sieve, 
creating ample opportunities for 
those who would do us harm to 
enter our country, said Feinstein.
President Bush has expressed 
interest in reorganizing immigra
tion policies. International stu
dents add greatly to the vitality 
and quality of our nations col
leges, universities, and other insti
tutions of learning, stated Bush. 
A goal of the program is to pro
hibit the education and training of 
foreign nationals who would use 
their training to harm the United
States and its allies. While the 
specifics of Bushs proposal did not 
extend beyond this statement, 
there has already been speculation 
about what these plans might 
entail.
Currently, international stu
dents must go through a multistep procedure in order to obtain 
an F-l, or a non-immigrant visa to 
study in the United States. 
According to State Department 
guidelines, an applicant must first 
be accepted into an American col
lege or university. The academic 
institution then sends the appli
cant a form that will grant the stu
dent eligibility for F-l status, 
called an 1-20. After student appli
cants fill out their I-20s, they must 
travel to the US embassy or con
sulate in their country to pick up a 
general non-immigrant visa appli
cation form (called an OF-156). 
They then must present a valid 
passport, a small photograph, 
their I-20s, OF-156s, and evidence 
that they can pay for college in the 
United States to the officer in the 
embassy or consulate. Some 
embassies require that students go 
through interviews after the forms 
are presented, while others devise 
their own system to verify a stu
dents F-l status. All students must 
pay a fee to obtain their visas. 
Even when students have complet
ed their paperwork, they are not 
automatically guaranteed entry 
into the United States. The 
Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS) has the authority to 
deny a student admission, as well 
as the ability to restrict the 
amount of time the student has 
permission to remain in the United 
States. At the airport of entry, an 
INS official verifies the students
paperwork and validates his or her 
record of arrival and departure, 
called an 1-94 form. This form tells 
the student how long he or she is 
allowed to stay in the United 
States.
As part of the proposed legisla
tion, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Services (INS) 
would be given $32.3 million to 
begin implementing a more strin
gent system, in which visa holders 
would be fingerprinted and pho
tographed, along with their 
spouse and children. Procedural 
changes in the visa process would 
include an added preliminary 
application to the INS and exten
sive background checks before the 
visa is approved by the State 
Department. Schools, for their 
part, would be required to sign an 
affidavit acknowledging their 
responsibility for visa compliance. 
They would also report to the INS 
on a quarterly basis about each 
students academic status, the 
types of courses undertaken and 
any disciplinary actions.
Feinstein said all of these 
changes were long overdue and, in 
fact, many were required by previ
ous legislation passed in the wake 
of the first World Trade Center 
bombing in 1993.
Bill Elliot, the vice president for 
Enrollment at CMU, does not 
believe that any proposed legisla
tion regarding international stu
dent visas will have a detrimental 
affect upon the University commu
nity. CMU wont suffer, said 
Elliot. We may not end up being 
as diverse, but we are going to fol
low federal regulations. [The pro
posed legislation] could be best for 
us in the long term, even if it hurts 
a few people in the short term.

ATTACK, from page A1 
possible sexual assault.
According to Police Chief Creig 
Doyle, Campus Police followed nor
mal protocol when notifying the cam
pus of the October 14 attack. Doyle 
said that 175 copies of a crime alert 
poster were distributed around cam
pus, with 75 handed out to students 
by officers and 100 copies given to 
Student Life. Despite these notifica
tion measures, some students did not 
feel that they had been adequately 
informed of the incident.
Considering the severity of the 
attack, the students should have been 
direcdy notified, said Elissa Lapide, a 
junior psychology major. The crime 
alert posters are not displayed in 
prominent places. The students defi
nitely need to know what is occurring 
on campus, and the crime posters are 
not very effective. Perhaps the 
Campus Police should send out email 
crime reports.
Other students question the effec
tiveness of crime alert posters in gen
eral, noting that the alerts often 
become lost in the myriad of papers 
on bulletin boards or remain posted
longer than necessary, causing stu
dents to disregard all crime announce
ments. [Crime alert posters] always 
seem a little vague, and I dont think 
they are updated enough, said 
Brooke Rosenthal, a junior design 
major.
We cant even be sure that 
[Campus Police] give us all the infor
mation they get about a crime, said 
Shannon Lynch, a junior English 
major.
Although Chief Doyle commented 
that students do not need to be more 
concerned about personal safety than 
at any other time, he said that he is 
working to make campus police more 
visible and available at Carnegie 
Mellon. By the end of the semester, 
there will be additional bike patrols 
and more identifiable officers on cam
pus, said Doyle. He also said that 
more clearly marked emergency 
phones are to be installed on campus.
Such improvements will be wel
comed by students who have 
expressed concerns about their safety 
on campus. There are many times 
that I walk home at night late, and I 
dont see any Campus Police, said
Rosenthal. I think that the police 
need to make themselves more notice
able and need to be patrolling into the 
evening. According to Doyle, there 
are now two officers patrolling on foot 
and two by vehicle during all shifts.
Although increased patrols will 
likely aid in the reassurance of campus 
community members, the seeming 
lack of information from Campus 
Police about crimes at CMU remains a 
problem. Should the students be 
aware that severe crimes take place on 
this campus, they would be able to 
protect themselves and perhaps pre
vent them from occurring again, said 
Lapide. I know that personally, ever 
since I have heard about the recent 
attack, I have been more cautious 
when walking around campus.
Campus safety may not rest just in 
the hands of University police and 
security forces, but also facility 
improvements. I wish some areas 
were better lit, for instance, the space 
coming from Wean Hall up beside 
Doherty is awfully dark and shad
owy, said Dwight Bussman, a sopho
more H&SS student.

News Brief:
CMU forms Security of Technology Office
In the weeks following the 
September 11 terrorist attacks, 
Carnegie Mellon considered estab
lishing a research institute for nation
al security on campus. However, offi
cials had second thoughts because of 
concerns that the institute could 
attract terrorists. Instead of seeking 
funding for a new institute, CMU 
decided last week to establish a 
Security of Technology Office to uti
lize the scientific, technological, and 
research expertise of faculty mem
bers.
Information about the originally 
proposed Institute for Homeland 
Security Research leaked out several 
weeks ago after two CMU faculty 
members associated with the project 
were exposed to anthrax while meet
ing in Washington, DC. Neither facul
ty member required antibiotics.
Soon after, according to Christina 
Gabriel, vice provost for Corporate 
Partnerships and Technology 
Development, the University began
to have doubts about the creation of a 
high profile institute that could possi
bly attract terrorists. At the request of 
Governor Tom Ridge, the director of 
Homeland Security, CMU sent a list 
to the White House of a dozen facul
ty members with expertise in the 
areas of computer security, robotics, 
networking technologies, analysis of 
data, and risk analysis. Involved fac
ulty members will work on short
term projects regarding national 
security. We have lots of folks shut
tling to Washington with some regu
larity, said Chris Gabriel.
According to Kathleen Carley, 
the Securities Technology Office is 
working on a simulation of bioter
rorist attacks that will help the gov
ernment analyze the efficiency of 
various responses and policies. The 
office is also working on how to 
design response teams and com
mand and control the teams so that 
they can rapidly adapt to new situ
ations.
Ken Gabriel, a professor of elec
trical and computer engineering at 
CMU, was awarded the head posi
tion at the new Security of 
Technology Office late last week. 
The University has benefited from 
years and decades of federal fund
ing and now its time to give some
thing back, said Gabriel. Before 
joining Carnegie Mellon four years 
ago, he was the director of the 
Electronics Technology Office at 
the Pentagons Defense Advanced 
Research Project Agency.
CMUs experience in multidisci
plinary research is expected to ben
efit the projects of the Security of 
Technology Office. University 
researchers plan to spend the next 
two to three weeks conducting 
experiments and assembling proto
types to determine which securityrelated projects merit more exten
sive research.

Crime and Incident Report
Suspicious Activity, 10/27/01, 
2:00 pm  During a routine patrol 
of Mellon Institute, an officer found a 
makeshift bicycle repair shop inside a 
locker room. A computer printout 
hanging in the room read, BRIANS 
BIKE SHOP. Numerous bicycle repair 
related items were scattered about 
the room. Three complete bicycles 
and three partially disassembled bicy
cles were also in the room. The officer 
could not determine the identity of 
the person responsible for the repair 
shop or if the bicycles in the room 
were stolen or abandoned property.
Medical, 10/28/01, 2:30 pm
 A student contacted police to noti
fy them that a student in the CFA 
Architecture Workshop had injured 
her hand. The responding officers 
arrived with EMS and found that the 
victim had cut three of her fingers 
with a table saw when her hand 
slipped. Severe bleeding was present 
at the site of the injury and the victim 
appeared to be going into shock. A 
city medical response unit was 
requested. EMS treated the victim for 
shock until the city medics transport
ed her to UPMC Presbyterian. CPS 
was notified for clean up.
Theft, 10/28/01, 5 pm -
Fraternity members observed a man 
removing clothing from a scarecrow 
hanging on a tree outside their house. 
CMU Police found the man just 
beyond Beeler Street. The man stated 
that he had been beaten up in town 
roughly a year earlier and had had all 
of his clothing removed except for his 
boxer shorts. The clothing on the 
scarecrow resembled the clothing the 
man had lost so he claimed the cloth
ing as his recovered property. He also 
claimed that his name and date of 
birth were inscribed in the items 
taken from the scarecrow. No such 
inscriptions were found in the cloth
ing. The actor also claimed his behav
ior was sanctioned by God. Police 
returned the clothing to fraternity 
members and released the actor after 
determining there were no outstand
ing warrants for his arrest. The man 
was warned not to return to CMU 
property.
Criminal Mischief, 10/29/01,
1:19 am  Two fraternity members
witnessed an act of vandalism. Three 
males dressed entirely in black 
entered the fraternity house in ques
tion and removed a table. The actors 
then threw the table over the wall of 
the front patio to the lawn, breaking 
two of the legs. The three males final
ly left the fraternity and walked 
toward the University Center. A fra
ternity member followed them but 
lost sight of the actors between 
Resnik and West Wing. The respond
ing officer advised the fraternity 
members to call Campus Police when 
they witness suspicious activity and 
let the police handle the situation.
Fire Alarm, 10/29/01, 9:01
pm  A CMU student reported a 
burning smell on the fourth floor of 
Morewood Gardens A-tower. The 
responding officer could not locate 
the source of the odor on the fourth 
floor. The officer checked the third 
floor yet found no odor or smoke. He 
then activated the fire alarm. A thor
ough search of the building found 
more smoke on the upper floor of the 
building and a burnt out elevator 
motor. The smoke from the motor 
rose and hung heavily in the upper 
floors. Many students were found in 
their rooms after the building was 
evacuated for the fire alarm. The fire 
chief stated that students ought to go 
before judicial review boards for not 
leaving the building.
Prank, 10/31/01, 8 am  A
CMU student called the police to 
report a strange envelope she 
received. The envelope contained a 
Halloween card with no return 
address or signature. The student was 
not expecting a card and stated she 
did not know who would have sent 
her the card. The card was confiscat
ed by Campus Police and placed in 
the Temporary Evidence Locker.
Suspicious Powder, 10/31. 
5:55 pm  Campus Police received 
a call that a suspicious white powder 
had been discovered in the restroom 
on the first floor of Bramer House. 
Two officers responded to the area 
and discovered that the door to the 
restroom had been closed and 
marked with a sign stating do not 
use. After a brief investigation, it 
appeared that the person who had
been responsible for the powder had 
used the restroom and had powder in 
his or her undergarments. The suspi
cious powder was in a 4 inch area of 
the floor directly beneath the toilet, 
and a 2 inch area on the porcelain 
part of the toilet. The building was 
cleared of any staff members and the 
area was sealed with police caution 
tape pending questioning of the 
buildings occupants.
Disorderly Conduct, 11/2/01, 
2:59 am  Three officers respond
ed to a report of a fight outside 
Mudge House. Upon arrival, the 
police observed two males walking 
away from the scene. A witness point
ed in their direction and stated, 
Thats them! As the officers turned 
their car around, the males began 
running away through the fraternity 
quad. An officer immediately pur
sued them and apprehended the two 
on top of a fraternity garage. The 
remaining officers followed close 
behind and handcuffed the actors. 
The officers identified one actor as a 
CMU student and the other as a Pitt 
student. The two stated they were 
walking back to the CMU students 
room when they decided to horse
play and began to fight each other. 
The actors said they ran from police 
because they were scared. Both males 
had an odor of alcohol on their per
son and had glassy, bloodshot eyes. 
After the pair admitted to consuming 
alcohol and being under 21 years of 
age, the officers issued them citations 
for disorderly conduct and underage 
consumption.
- Campus Sergeant Budzick 
reviews all reports prior to release.
- Only four people on The Tartan 
staff see the reports: the Editors-inChief, the News Editor, and the 
staffwriter typing the report.
- All personal names of com
plainants, victims, suspects, and fra
ternities are omitted from the print
ed report. Ethnic descriptions and 
other personal details are given only 
in the context of complete descrip
tions.
- Not every incident that occurs 
appears in the report.

HUB course scheduling system 
in dire need of improvement
Tu<essUy
One tool widely used by CMU students 
but not supported by the HUB Web site is 
Schedule-O-Matic. This very helpful tool 
created by CMU graduate Pete Pawlowski 
provided students with a graphical repre
sentation of their course schedules. All stu
dents have to do is type in course numbers, 
press a submit button, and they are imme
diately presented with a visual representa
tion of their course schedule.
Unfortunately, this tool is no longer 
updated since the creator of this program 
graduated from CMU last spring. Since 
then, nobody has been able to update the 
information for Schedule-O-Matic so that 
it can recognize newly added, changed, or 
abandoned courses. It is almost impossible 
to use it now since there is a possibility it 
will not recognize many of the courses you 
type in for the spring semester. Since the 
Schedule-O-Matic was very popular 
among CMU students it only makes sense 
that the HUB should take it upon them
selves to implement this tool into their 
Web site. If the HUB takes over it wont be 
up to just one student to maintain and 
update the siteresponsibility for mainte
nance will fall on the HUB.
The HUB should make an effort to clean 
up its online presence. Since service they 
provide has become so vital to the 
Carnegie Mellon community it is impera
tive that the site be well maintained and 
well organized. Efforts must be made to 
decrease the lag time of accessing the Web 
site and to re-organize the information 
provided to be consistent throughout the 
site so that students can actually use the 
services that are provided for them. The 
HUBs adoption of the Schedule-O-Matic 
would also alleviate some anxiety of the 
online registration process. If one student 
was able to maintain such a grand tool 
then it would not be too much effort for 
the HUB to maintain it as well.
The HUB Web site has come a long way 
since its introduction in September 1997, 
but it still lacks basic functionality that has 
become essential for many CMU students. 
The HUB Web site allows students to 
access their student account balance, 
enrollment and schedule data, financial 
aid records, and grades. In addition the 
Web site offers students the ability to regis
ter for classes online which simplifies the 
routine of registration. But potentially 
more useful sections of the HUB Web site 
are the online access of course descriptions 
and course schedules. Today, one of the 
Web sites primary flaws is its incompre
hensible user interface and lacks function
ality in the course schedule area.
The HUB Web site becomes even more 
important before and during class registra
tion. Students go online to read up on the 
classes being offered for next semester and 
try and figure out which classes can be 
scheduled together without any conflicts. 
But the poor performance of the Web site 
makes the course scheduling portion of the 
Web site truly inconvenient for its users.
There have been continuous problems 
with the HUBs entire Web site, but more 
specifically with the course scheduled por
tion of the site. Students have received 
error messages and connection failures 
when trying to access certain portions of 
the Web site. Sometimes it takes so long to 
access the Web site that students give up 
and try again later only to encounter the 
same problem as before. The organization 
of the HUB Web site can confuse students 
who are not aware of what is accessible 
through the Web site. The frustrations of 
dealing with the near impossibility of 
accessing such critical information have 
gotten so bad that one student has taken it 
upon himself to mirror the Spring 2002 
schedule of classes on his personal Web 
site.

car too, can you hope to find a space. I 
was hoping to avoid this hassle this year 
by applying for a space, but let me tell 
you, when they look you in the eye and 
say that Mr. 230 On The Waitlist can basi
cally give up hope of getting a space for 
this year, all you can do is tuck tail and 
come back early on Saturday nights and 
pray for a space.
Like last year, I parked on Margaret 
Morrison. Its the best solution left to me, 
and Id be whiningly satisfied with it if I 
had not gotten so royally screwed over 
last week. After getting back on Sunday 
night (the 21st) from mid-semester 
break, I parked on Margaret Morrison 
Avenue right by Woodlawn Apartments, a 
perfectly legal parking space. I come back 
last Friday afternoon to get my car and lo 
and behold, my cars gone and its been 
replaced by a construction zone. My car 
was towed (I found out later) on the 
Wednesday between when I left it and 
when I found it gone.
When I parked on Margaret Morrison 
(which I never would do if there were 
enough parking spaces in permit lots) 
there were no visible signs saying that the 
area where my car was to become a con
struction zone.
According to hearsay, there were sup
posedly notes put on cars windshields 
serving as notification that they would 
have to be moved. Well, since I dont want 
to move my car during the week because 
Ill never get another space on Margaret 
Morrison if I do, I tend not to be in a posi
tion to keep a constant vigil over my cars 
windshield. By the time I was in a position 
to see any such note, my car had been in 
the Pittsburgh Pound Lot for two days.
Sure, parking permits are overpriced, 
but because of the extremely limited 
available parking, I had to pay $199 to 
get my car back. Thats $110 for the 
tow, $45 for storage, and a $44 dollar 
ticket for parking in the construction 
zone they constructed around my car. 
Throw in a couple parking tickets I took 
on the chin because the yellow curbs on 
Margaret Morrison arent yellow any
more, and Ive basically already paid for 
a parking permit.
I hope in the future Parking Services (or 
Campus Police, or someone) can make 
the effort to just send out an email saying 
that parking on Margaret Morrison, or 
somewhere else on campus, was to be 
restricted for some time. I know everyone 
got those dozen emails about the East 
Campus Garage, so they obviously know 
how. This would be just a small step in 
becoming a warmer and fuzzier adminis
trative department. On top of that, they 
can make that stupid garage taller and/or 
deeper, extend the parking zones on 
Margaret Morrison, and try to find new 
places for people to park. Maybe then I 
can send in ranting emails about Housing 
Services instead....

Nary a weekend passes when theres 
not a precarious tower of uncollected 
printouts sitting on every campus printer. 
(And scads of print jobs languishing in 
the queues, waiting on someone to add 
even more paper to the mess).
I applaud the Universitys efforts to go 
green and I appreciate Sinduja 
Srinivasans article on recycling, but recy
cling awareness alone will not do: just 
have a look, sometime, at the water and 
energy usage required to recycle a batch 
of office paper.
No, the University needs to implement 
policies to reduce use. A good place to 
start might be to charge students for 
printouts after the first 100 pages per 
semester. This will make us think before 
we hit the print button. Any profits could 
be used to improve the recycling pro
gram, maybe by hiring a contractor who 
wont throw out a whole bag of recyclables just because they find one bagel in 
the bag!
Aligning everyday incentives for people 
with good conservation policies will 
almost always gain more than after-thefact reuse programs, no matter how many 
people are aware of the recycling.

American democratic society has no room 
for conservatism, was just to elicit some 
vehement opposition.
His basic claim, that the likes of Pat 
Robertson and Jerry Falwell represent the 
thinking of mainstream American conser
vatives is so absurd as to be laughable. 
What would he say if I presented an argu
ment bashing modern liberalism, saying 
that all liberals shared their ideologies 
with the Reverend Jesse Jackson and the 
Rainbow Coalition? Of course he would 
say that although they are liberals, they 
represent a small radical wing of a large 
overreaching ideology. Similarly, while 
the religious right shares some values 
with mainstream conservatives, the 
groups ideals are in no way indicative of 
the views of the millions of middle-of-theroad conservatives in this country.
Of course the word conservatism brings 
to Andys mind images such as Watergate 
and Falwell, because Im sure he gets all 
the news he needs from Peter Jennings 
and Tom Brokaw. Unfortunately, the 
news media in this country is very biased 
towards the left and supplies the general 
public with an incredibly skewed account 
of the news. For instance, after the media 
extensively reported the brutal and inex
cusable murder of Matthew Shepard, 
another crime that didnt fit their agenda 
was effectively ignored. Jesse Dirkhising, 
a 13-year-old Arkansas boy, was bound, 
drugged, and raped for hours by two 
homosexual partners before they killed 
him. This crime, while just as gruesome 
and hate-oriented as Matthew Shepards 
murder, received almost no media atten
tion. Until Americans not only realize that 
their coverage is unsatisfactory but also 
take action to become informed of both 
sides of an issue, we are bound to listen to 
sadly misinformed people rant about 
what they think are the central tenets 
of conservatism.
In short, people like Andy should stop 
believing everything they hear and get 
their facts straight before they try to 
spread their political propaganda. His 
skewed facts only deal with an incredi
bly small part of the entire conservative 
spectrum and in no way represent the 
ideals of American conservatism, as 
he asserts.

Parking problems
Editors:
I have long been of the opinion that 
Parking Services at Carnegie Mellon are 
basically terrible. Not only are there a 
meager number of student parking spaces 
available (making yours truly, a sopho
more, number 230 on the wait list for a 
space at the beginning of this year), but 
the alternatives to a parking permit are 
close to zero. If one does not have a park
ing permit for one of the overpriced park
ing spaces, there are three choices: park 
in the garage for $5.50 a day, park on 
Margaret Morrison Avenue, or park way 
the hell off campus somewhere like on 
Northumberland.
Last year I did those last two options, 
usually being able to find a spot on 
Margaret Morrison, occasionally having 
to trek all the way from Scobell to 
Northumberland to get to my car. The 
best thing about parking on Margaret 
Morrison, by the way, is that if you move

or break it.
This past week, the Ford 
family ousted Jacques 
Nasser in favor of their 
favorite son, William Clay 
Ford, Jr., direct descendent 
of Henry himself. Over the 
past few years, Ford has run 
into the Firestone quagmire, 
anti-discrimination law
suits brought by middleaged white men, problems 
between management and 
employees, massive quality 
problems, and seriously 
eroding relations with 
its suppliers.
With the possible excep
tion of the Firestone tire 
recall, most of these issues 
bear the mark of Nasser. 
When the economy was run
ning high and Fords cash 
pile was growing faster than 
anthrax paranoia, Nasser 
was working on turning 
Ford into a company that 
changes every five years. 
Making one of the great 
management mistakes advo
cated by business leaders 
and business schools alike, 
he wanted to recreate Ford 
in General Electrics image.
The result? Ford worried
more about reshaping its 
business than its actual busi
ness: making cars. They are 
now paying the price.
Meanwhile, down the 
street in Michigan, GM 
struggles with the aftermath 
of the terrorist attacks. 
While Ford and others have 
slashed production, GM has 
boldly moved to both take 
back market share and keep 
its plants running. (GM must 
do this since its contract 
with the UAW requires it to 
pay something like 90 percent 
of wages if it lays people off.)

What else needs changing except 
the food! It seems like its getting worse 
each day.
But, Seriously...
by: Sean Mintus
Just when I thought that this school and its higher-ups had 
learned to behave themselves, Im proven wrong. A few days 
short of hanging up my gloves and discontinuing the rueful 
and public magnification of the countless injustices our 
school commits, I caught wind of the latest and greatest inci
dent of faulty practices. Thats right. Im back.
A few weeks ago, a CMU student vandalized some proper
ty. That student was promptly caught, detained, questioned, 
and brought before Dean of Student Affairs Michael Murphy 
to receive his mandatory lecture and punishment. Nothing 
wrong with that. The kid screwed up. We all do. 
Occasionally, we get caught. However, as the details of the 
investigation and interrogation came trickling my way, I 
became aware of what, in my opinion, were the dirty, under
handed methods that Murphy used to extract information 
from this student.
The student, henceforth known as Ross, was sentenced to 
300 hours of community service and, in the process, was 
forced to endure several meetings with the dean and his 
lackeys, wherein Ross was tormented and insulted on a fair
ly regular basis. This behavior on the part of these University 
employees, while not entirely unjustified, caused the 
student to take time away from his studies, resulting in a 
tremendous amount of personal distress, and having to drop 
a course.
At. first, I really didnt care all that much. Ross trashed some 
public property and was caught. As a proud vandal, I curse 
his name for not getting away with it and adding fuel to the 
oppressive authoritative fire that aims to seek out all would 
be rabble-rousers and punish them. I firmly believe that a 
society without its uncivilized and morally repugnant 
vagrants is false, boring, and completely unattainable. One 
must take the good with the bad. Society on the whole is cer
tainly no exception.
So thats that. Ross messed up. Ross was punished. Ross 
feels bad. Ross goes about his business. Case closed. Nope.
It was only after I learned of the severity of the punish
ment and the impetus behind it that I came to recognize this 
case as one hinging more on our deans personal pride 
and egomaniacal rage than one of preserving social dignity 
and order.
According to Ross, this punishment was meant to extract a 
revenge on the student in some great perversion of this 
schools half-cocked legal system, as opposed to fitting him 
with an inconvenient set of duties that will give him time to 
think about his wrongdoings. Murphy, instead of concentrat
ing on Rosss crime and the most productive means with 
which to deal with it, sought to punish him for the lies he ini
tially told in an attempt to save his own ass.
So Murphy went after this student on an individual basis 
and the justification behind it was that the student lied ini
tially to protect a friend and then later on to tone down a sit
uation that really only amounted to some low-level immatu
rity and some busted property. The kid lied? Big deal. Find 
me one person who hasnt lied to save their own ass and 
wouldnt do it again if the opportunity presented itself. 
Surely Murphs done it.
Lets line this up next to another incident that occurred not 
too long ago. A CMU fraternity, caught red-handed producing 
and trafficking narcotics, was given 1000 hours of communi
ty service and was forced to leave its residence for at least one 
year. This fraternity, at the time, was made up of roughly 50 
members. Im sure I dont need to, but Ill do the math for you. 
Thats 20 hours apiece. This, for committing a felony. Ross, 
who damaged some property, was given 300.
Ill not calling into question the legitimacy of the specific 
laws involved in these two incidents. You all know full well 
that I condone drug use. As far as Im concerned, the use of 
narcotics is a personal life choice not to be addressed by the 
authorities. I find it sickening that I live in a country that dic
tates what I can and cannot put into my body while it allows, 
in a brutal and slanted sense, the merciless slaughter of 
unborn children. But thats beside the point. For the time 
being, it is illegal to produce, possess, use, or transport illegal 
narcotics. We all have to deal with it and eagerly await the 
day when this country gets a better sense of itself.
Back to Ross. In this case, Murphys actions seem to indi
cate not a vested interest in preserving the sanctity of the uni
versity that signs his checks, but unchecked power mongering. After his first meeting with Murphy, Ross was reassured 
that the police were to be left out of the matter and that he 
and the dean would reach an agreement whereby Ross would 
receive appropriate punishment. A day later, convinced that 
Ross was still withholding information, Detective Lang went 
to the students residence for, in my opinion, the purpose of 
intimidating him and forcing the release of more facts. This, 
after Ross had already told Murphy the entire story.

Anthrax economics: patents and contracts
David Anderson
Week three of the anthrax scare has 
come and passed and it has proven to 
be less dangerous than a normal week. 
More Americans died from smoking, 
pneumonia, influenza, and boredom 
last week than from anthrax. Yet, even 
with this simple fact in mind, the 
American government is devoted to 
wiping out anthrax and is willing to 
override normal priorities and prac
tices without thinking.
Last week, it was announced that the 
United States government had been 
able to negotiate a deal with the 
German company Bayer, to buy Cipro 
at a dramatic reduction in price. Now 
the brand name pills will cost only nine
ty five cents a pill versus the two dollars 
and eighty six cents that they cost on 
September 10. The federal government 
has portrayed this as honest negotia
tions between a large, potentially 
monopolist, consumer and a monopo
listic producer. Prices, under this expla
nation, are fairly determined by mutual 
self interest. However, one can argue, 
and I would not be surprised if Bayer 
does in a future lawsuit, that this agree
ment came under duress and Bayer 
deserves to be compensated.
Bayer researched thousands of differ
ent compounds and elements before 
they were able to bring Cipro to the 
market place. Their incentive to con
duct the massive amounts of research in 
the hope of finding a useful drug is that 
they can make enough money from that 
lucky find to cover the costs of testing 
the thousands of unproductive com
pounds. The governments of the indus
trialized world believe that private 
research is often more efficient than 
direct government research. Therefore, 
the governments of the world have a 
strong incentive to ensure a reasonable 
chance of profitability and recoupment 
of costs for drug research companies. 
The means that they have to ensure this 
goal is the patent system which grants a 
temporary monopoly on the useful 
drug to the originators. The patent 
allows the producer to charge whatever 
the market is willing to bear for 17 
years, and then the drug goes into the 
public domain where generic, non
researching firms, can also sell the same 
product. Generic drugs are cheaper 
than brand name drugs because the 
producers are operating in a dramati
cally more competitive markets and 
also all research costs have already been 
borne by someone else.
The price of Cipro on September 10 
was controlled by Bayer, and it could be 
changed at any time that Bayer wished 
to. However, it was Bayers choice 
under its patent for Cipro to control the 
price. When the anthrax scare began, 
Cipro was quickly seen as the treatment 
of choice for this disease. The federal 
government believed that it needed to 
enlarge the stockpile of antibiotics it 
had available and decided that Cipro 
should be bought for its effectiveness.
However, the federal government 
balked at the costs of respecting the 
patent held by Bayer. It wanted to pay 
marginal production costs for the drug 
and not aid in covering the sunk 
research and overhead costs. It there
fore threatened to pull the patent from 
Bayer and allow generic manufactur
ers an opportunity to produce Cipro. 
This threat is legal if the government 
is willing to compensate Bayer for the 
loss of its intellectual property. 
However, there is no evidence that this 
will, occur. Therefore, Bayer has effec
tively been stripped of its incentive to 
conduct research on new drugs 
because there is now uncertain prop
erty rights. Surprisingly, there has 
been no uproar concerning this posi
tion from the American public or the 
legal professions in the United States. I 
believe that this is because most peo
ple correctly see this as an extra-ordinary national emergency.
While this may be a national crisis 
and extraordinary, the American gov
ernment has historically not allowed for 
the same understanding when other 
countries decide that they have a 
national health care emergency and can 
not afford to pay brand name prices for 
important and life saving drugs. For 
instance, the current and previous 
administrations were both on the 
record opposing South Africas plans to 
either import or produce low cost, 
generic versions of modem, patented 
AIDS drugs. The logic was that this was 
stealing the intellectual property of 
research firms. Therefore, the American 
government has consistently sought to 
have all nations respect the Western, 
industrialized, and wealthy ideals of 
product patents and intellectual proper
ty rights, even if it meant that millions of 
people would die because they could 
not afford the medicine that could treat 
them or prevent the further spread of 
infectious diseases.
South Africa and AIDS are not the
only cases of this problem happening 
elsewhere in the world. India has 
approached the problem of treating 
millions of people with limited funds by 
a novel patenting method. Instead of 
granting a monopolistic patent on a 
final, useful product, the Indian gov
ernment grants a patent for one partic
ular method of producing a product, in 
this case a drug. The chemical composi
tion of the drug is then made public 
knowledge and generic drug manufac
turers are able to see if they can figure 
out a way to make the same chemical 
compound by a different method. This 
patent methodology does provide dis
incentives toward research but it allows 
India to be able to treat many common 
diseases at a fraction of the cost. Again, 
this is an approach that the United 
States has historically opposed.
However, I hope that the experience 
of expropriating intellectual property 
without just compensation as it appears 
to be the case with Cipro and Bayer will 
lead to a rethinking of American public 
health policy. There are several differ
ent means of accomplishing this task. 
The first is to compensate Bayer for its 
research costs. The United States gov
ernment would buy a license at fair 
market value for the right to produce 
generic Cipro. This would be consistent 
with maintaining the incentives for pri
vate firms to conduct research. Another 
approach, and in my opinion, the pre
ferred method, is to assume that global 
and public health overall is fundamen
tally a public good from which every
one gains benefits from. This change in 
worldview would mean that people 
would have a fundamental right to 
medical care at the lowest available 
price possible. The federal government 
would also be more responsible for 
funding research so that new drugs and 
treatments could be developed. I per
sonally prefer the federal government 
giving contracts to private companies 
so that the profit motive will encourage 
a higher degree of efficiency, but that is 
a detail that can be resolved at a later 
date. This policy and ideological 
change should also give the benefit of 
decreasing Third World opposition to 
free trade practices because 80 percent 
of the world would stand to gain direct 
benefits from this policy. It has the cost 
of imposing some barriers and speed 
bumps into the free market, but I think 
that this cost is well worth it.

The government has done a good job in responding to 
the tragedy on September 11. It has allocated money to 
help the victims and their families. A new cabinet posi
tion, Homeland Security, has been created. Our President 
has declared war on terrorism. And presently, Congress is 
debating over an airline safety bill to increase airport 
security and to prevent another occurrence of this 
disaster. Now that our government has taken care of the 
wounds, is carrying out justice in Afghanistan, and 
is safeguarding our country from another attack, 
can one now contemplate the question: Could it have 
been prevented?
I, along with many other students out of state, fly to 
and from Carnegie Mellon each summer, winter, and 
spring. I always see flaws in their security procedures. 
Usually, I carry two carry-on bags with me. I put them in 
the x-ray machine and it goes through. Well this time 
they opened one of my bags up  this was August, by the 
way  and they went through that bag. They did not, 
however, check my other bag. Now, I could have easily

like this from happening again.
carried a knife or some other dangerous thing in the 
unchecked bag. These are the small mistakes that may 
have contributed to the disaster. And to add to the matter, 
everyone knows about the cardboard door that separates 
the cockpit from the rest of the plane. Anyone can get 
through. Im sure the hijackers knew all about these secu
rity flaws.
The hijackers only had box cutters and nothing else, yet 
they were able to take control of four planes, three of 
which arrived at their targets. There were between 50 
and 80 people aboard each plane but, somehow, no one 
stopped them, with the exception of the plane that 
crashed in western Pennsylvania, thanks to the heroics of 
the people on board. It seems that the security measures 
to prevent this scenario were non-existent. Some of the
men were even on the FBIs wanted list, yet they were not 
apprehended. It seems like we were inviting terrorists to 
hijack the planes. From the descriptions of the hijacking, 
the terrorists had an easy time doing it. How can the most 
powerful country in the world not manage to keep its own 
territory safe? Certainly our country could have acted 
before this happened.
Our country has tried to increase safety before, but 
with no results. After TWA Flight 800 crashed, Vice 
President A1 Gore was placed on a aviation safety and 
security commission. This happened in 1996.The com
mission recommended procedures and security precau
tions. However, this entailed a cost to the airlines. Of 
course the airlines complained to the commission that 
the procedures would result in delays and would 
be inefficient.
And lo and behold, a few days after their complaints, 
Mr. Gore sent a letter to these companies saying, quote, I 
want to make it very clear that it is not the intent of this 
administration or of the commission to create a hardship 
for the air transportation industry. In other words, he 
backed down to the pressure of the airline companies. 
Soon after that, the Democratic National Committee 
received around $600,000 from American Airlines, Delta, 
United, and Northwest. These donations came close to 
the end of the Clinton-Gore 96 campaign, according to 
an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Seems 
awfully suspicious to me. In the end, the commission 
did very little to increase safety and security in the air
lines; but thats all in the past, lets concentrate on the 
present situation.
The airline safety bill that I previously mentioned was 
introduced into the Senate around a month ago. Just 
recently, on November 1, the House rejected it with a 286 
to 139 vote. Now the House and the Senate will go into a 
conference to edit the bill. One reason for the rejection is 
because of a Republican-sponsored measure that leaves 
airport screeners eployed by security companies contract
ed by the airlines but allows the federal government over
sight. Hopefully, the airline lobbyists or unions wont 
influence our congressmen, nor will they involve politics 
in it. The bill is needed, not only for the peace of mind for 
the citizens, but because it will be effective in preventing 
anything like this from ever happening again. Lives 
have been lost and now our congressman must put aside 
their politics.
The tragedy could have been prevented but nothing 
was done beforehand. We have a chance to correct that 
mistake and to prevent another reoccurrence. Im sure 
that under the leadership of President Bush our policies 
will change.

cent financing for their cars.
If the finance boys at GM manage 
to pull this one off, they should all be 
hired as professors at GSIA. Theyre 
borrowing at five percent and lend
ing at zero percent, a definite no-no 
for you arts and humanities majors. 
They may also be shifting future 
demand to the current year, leaving 
them vulnerable if the economy 
remains mired in its current reces
sion for more than a few quarters.
I have always felt that GM foolishly 
pursues market share at the expense 
of profitability, but it does have a 
rather large retirement package to 
support. GM helped contribute to 
this, however. During the 80s, when 
Ford and then-Chrysler slimmed 
down, GM failed to do so. It now pays 
the price. Consider it the Soviet 
Union of the auto world, straining 
under the own weight of its size.
And then theres Daimler-Chrysler. 
Feeling the synergy that comes 
from the merger of two equals, it 
had to replace its top American lead
ership with a troubleshooter from 
Germany. Much of the cross-platform 
technology sharing promised years 
ago never materialized, and the 
scrappy car and design guys that 
helped s?,re Chrysler are gone.
The oniv bright spots seem to be 
ioyotc '>nd Honda, which have made
market share gains at the expense of 
the others. Japanese auto manufac
turers tend to run more efficiently 
than their American counterparts, 
but there are signs the infection is 
spreading. Toyota, known for work
ing with suppliers to improve quality 
and control costs, has picked up the 
Big 3s (Big 2 if you want to get tech
nical) habit of simply demanding 
yearly price reductions from suppli
ers. Such a shame....
So, can the industry survive? The 
American auto makers have shown 
resilience in the past. Just when the 
Japanese manufacturers looked like 
they would eat their lunches, GM, 
Ford, and then-Chrysler managed to 
figure out how to build good cars. 
Can they revive themselves again?
The brightest spot in all this is GMs 
decision to hire Bob Lutz, who retired 
from Chrysler. If GM can survive long 
enough for Lutzs magic to work its 
way into the company, you will see 
some fantastic cars come out of GM. 
GM has always had a blocky, plain 
design to its cars, yet it knows how to 
make muscle cars and cars with a lot 
of get-up-and-go. Combine that with 
Lutz skills, and youll see some 
unique designs to rival the 
Thunderbird, Viper, and Prowler. 
Lets just hope that GM figures out 
how to market them successfully. 
Remember that this is the same com
pany that dropped the old Impala
and brought it back as a weaker 
front-wheel drive car.
(Side note to future GM engineers: 
Drop the system of separate keys for 
the ignition and the door locks.)
Daimler-Chryslers challenge is to 
regain its design leadership. Im not 
sure that such a thing can be done, 
given the German managements 
personality and culture. They 
will, however, greatly improve 
Chryslers quality.
Longer term, Ford is perhaps the 
best positioned to regain its competi
tiveness. Before everything went bad, 
it was close to overtaking GM, and it 
was very profitable. (Though not as 
profitable as Chrysler was before 
Daimler-Benz took over.) It ruled the 
truck market with the F-150, and its 
latest designs for hybrid vehicles 
offer serious competition to the 
likes of Subaru. Hell, the same com
pany could get people to buy a 
$50,000 Lincoln truck. Now thats a 
car company!

SIKm
Security stolen
Kathleen A. Fischer
Over midsmester break, my car was stolen 
while I was in New Jersey. I came out to exact
ly where I had parked less than 12 hours earli
er, and it was gone. I was shocked and con
fused. There was no broken glass or other tell
tale signs. It was like the carpet was pulled out 
from under me with no trace of who did it, or 
why, or where they were now.
It was the first time I was the victim of crime. 
It was strange and awful. I couldnt help blam
ing myself and wondering what I could have 
done differently. Why my car? Why an averagelooking 1995 Saturn without a souped-up 
stereo or gilded hubcaps? Why me?
The car was recovered with little damage 
and theft. My nonviolent crime had a simple 
happy ending. But this small experience gave 
me a tiny taste of how a fellow Carnegie Mellon 
female student must have felt when she was 
attacked on October 14 between 6 and 7 pm 
between Hunt Library and CFA. Ironically 
enough, the attack occurred in the pretty area 
called the Peace Garden. Security was violent
ly ripped away from her, and in the process, 
also stolen from the entire campus.
As a female student at Carnegie Mellon, I 
have always felt pretty safe on campus. I have 
walked home varying distances at all hours of 
the night, often alone, and not felt too nervous 
(this says a lot coming from someone who 
openly admits that she is afraid of the dark). 
Campus Police are around a lot, whether in 
cars, on foot, or by bicycle. I like to think of the 
campus community as being comprised of 
good and trustworthy people. But every now 
and then, a frightening and unsettling event 
changes these securities, and it is not fair.
I remember in the fall of 1999, when a stu
dent was attacked in front of Amberson 
Apartments and being upset and furious for 
her. Some man, in an instant, stole that victims
sense of security, as well as that of other 
women at Carnegie Mellon. We comforted our
selves knowing that at least it was off-campus; 
at least I still felt safe walking from Hunt 
Library to Margaret Morrisons courtyard.
But this violent crime is very different, as it 
occurred on our campus. It happened quickly, 
but in daylight. Someone probably walked by, 
and the thought probably didnt occur to that 
person that such a crime could be happening 
on our supposed haven of main campus.
All through the University, there are whis
pers of fear and doubt, wondering how such an 
act could happen without anyone seeing or 
stopping it. And I am sure that I at least speak 
for the women in the Carnegie Mellon commu
nity when I say that I keep looking over my
I am sure that I at least 
speak for the women in 
the Carnegie Mellon 
community when I say 
that I keep looking over 
my shoulder when I walk 
on campus, night or day.
shoulder when I walk on campus, night or day. 
It is not that my faith in Campus Police has 
decreased. It is my naivete that has lessened.
The repercussions of this crime have not 
been isolated. The crime against this woman 
has victimized everyone at CMU. As a campus 
community, we must look out for each other 
and ourselves. More than anything, we must 
show support to those who need it.

Justice with a smile: In search of fair punishments, appropriate reactions
MINTUS, from page A7
This is where it gets a little more com
plicated and a lot messier. Mr. Murphy is 
not only the dean of Student Affairs; Mr. 
Murphy simultaneously occupies the 
aforementioned office and one known 
as house fellow, a position meant to 
serve as a buffer between an accused 
student or students and the judicial 
board that hands down a decision.
Murphy wrote up the 300 hour sen
tence while wearing his house fellow 
hat, submitted it to the Mediation 
Review Board while wearing his dean 
hat, and then explained to Ross that, 
while he had the opportunity to let the 
judicial board hand down a decision, 
they were just as likely to bump it up as 
they were to decrease it. All this while 
knowing all along that if the board came 
back with a lighter sentence, Murphy 
would still have the final say and would 
most likely up Rosss penalty for having 
gone over his head.
Lets take a step back and confound 
the issue further. On the night that Ross 
was busted, several things were 
explained to him that completely contra
dict everything we are taught to expect 
as citizens. It seems as it essentially, by 
becoming a CMU student, you wave 
your Miranda rights. From what I heard, 
on multiple occasions, Ross was told by 
one Officer Simonetti and by Murphy 
himself that he no rights.
And yes, that is a direct quote. If you 
dont like it, feel free to let me know. But 
be warned: No man may knock on my 
door unless he is carrying a summons or 
a pizza.
Down to brass tacks. Carnegie Mellon 
Police can search your campus residence 
without a warrant. They can enter the 
premises without probable cause. And 
you cannot refuse to answer their ques
tions without being considered in viola
tion of a University statute mandating 
your cooperation with an officer. While 
the first two are permissible because 
many of us reside on CMU property, the 
third is not. And I urge anyone who is 
told that they must answer an officers 
question without the presence of an 
attorney to smile politely and stare off 
into space.
Back to my punching bag. Dean
Murphy does exist to discipline stu
dents. After all, he is a University offi
cial and must preserve order. We all 
cant go around destroying property and 
getting away with it. But his scare tac
tics and abuse of power go well beyond 
the boundaries of legal and ethical 
judgement, not to mention respect for a 
bright young student who, until this 
point, gave nobody any reason to sus
pect him of anything. If any public 
judge, from a lowly circuit court bench 
rider to Clarence Thomas, performed in 
this manner, they would be put into 
prison. Yes, Ross is an idiot. Not because 
he committed a crime  more people 
than would care to admit commit crimes 
on a daily basis  but because he got 
caught. Thats clear enough. But why 
would the dean of students, an adminis
trator at this University whose prime 
interests lie first and foremost in the 
successful completion of a rigorous aca
demic program by all of its students, 
choose to single out one and disrupt one 
persons progress?
Ive received numerous complaints 
over the last week regarding my calling
Murphy a pompous Jesuit in my last 
column. In retrospect, he should feel 
lucky thats all he got. I never thought 
him worth my time until this new infor
mation came my way.
What pisses me off most about this is 
that our dean has better things to do 
than berate and frighten kids. Id like to 
think that hed spend a little more time 
investigating the assault that occurred 
on our campus a few weeks ago. Yeah, I 
know about that one too. And I know 
how its been keep quiet so that all of 
the prospective students wont hear one 
word about it when they come and visit. 
I know how the courtship of 18,000 high 
school seniors is considered to be a 
higher priority than protecting the ones 
already snagged. I also know that if the 
University would just admit that an 
assault occurred on the campus, wed all 
be better off. The general campus com
munity deserves to know about this, and 
you could tell them while ensuring that 
the student involved remained safely 
anonymous. Theres too much paranoia 
and too many half-truths being slung 
around for anyone to get their
head straight.
Im watching you, Mr. Murphy, and I 
look forward to the day when, 
inevitably, our paths will cross. I wont 
roll over like Ross. Ill have big-time 
ACLU lawyers beating down the 
entrance to Warner and slapping your 
Gestapo with so many personal conduct 
lawsuits that itll make your head spin.
Call me crazy, but wouldnt the deans 
thugs be more effective if used to patrol 
the campus and protect the students? I 
know that having them visit dorms and 
threaten suspects is fun, but theyve got 
other matters to attend to. So Ill go out 
on a limb and assume that there is some 
sliver of humanity hidden deep down 
within his blackened soul. Ill give him 
the benefit of the doubt and hope that 
he still cares about us as human beings, 
even though hes clearly demonstrated 
that he thinks nothing of us as students 
and patrons of his University.

Terrorism and the Moral Failure of American Foreign Policy

END STATES WHO SPONSOR TERRORISM
By Leonard Peikoff
Fifty years of increasing American appeasement in the 
Mideast have led to fifty years of increasing contempt in the 
Muslim world for the U.S. The climax was September 11,2001.
Fifty years ago, Truman and Eisenhower surrendered the 
West's property rights in oil, although that oil rightfully belonged 
to those in the West whose science, technology, and capital 
made its discovery and use possible. The first country to 
nationalize Western oil, in 1951, was Iran. The rest, observing 
our frightened silence, hurried to grab their piece of the newly 
available loot.
The cause of the U.S. silence was not practical, but 
philosophical. The Mideast's dictators were denouncing wealthy 
egotistical capitalism. They were crying that their poor needed 
our sacrifice; that oil, like all property, is owned collectively, 
by virtue of birth; and that they knew their viewpoint was true 
by means of otherworldly emotion. Our Presidents had no 
answer. Implicitly, they were ashamed of the Declaration of 
Independence. They did not dare to answer that Americans, 
properly, were motivated by the selfish desire to achieve 
personal happiness in a rich, secular, individualist society.
The Muslim countries embodied in an extreme form every 
ideaselfless duty, anti-materialism, faith or feeling above 
science, the supremacy of the groupwhich our universities, 
our churches, and our own political Establishment had long 
been upholding as virtue. When two groups, our leadership 
and theirs, accept the same basic ideas, the most consistent 
side wins.
After property came liberty. The Muslim fundamentalist 
movement, writes Yale historian Lamin Sanneh, "began in 
1979 with the Iranian [theocratic] revolution.. " (NYT 9/23/01). 
During his first year as its leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, urging a 
Jihad against the Great Satan, kidnapped 52 U.S. diplomatic 
personnel and held them hostage; Carter's reaction was 
fumbling paralysis. About a decade later, Iran topped this 
evil. Khomeini issued his infamous Fatwa aimed at censoring, 
even outside his borders, any ideas uncongenial to Muslim 
sensibility. This was the meaning of his threat to kill British 
author Rushdie and to destroy his American publisher; their 
crime was the exercise of their right to express an unpopular 
intellectual viewpoint. The Fatwa was Irans attempt, reaffirmed 
after Khomeinis death, to stifle, anywhere in the world, the very 
process of thought. Bush Sr. looked the other way.
After liberty came American life itself. The first killers were 
the Palestinian hijackers of the late 1960s. But the killing spree 
which has now shattered our soaring landmarks, our daily 
routine, and our souls, began in earnest only after the license 
granted by Carter and Bush Sr.
Many nations work to fill our body bags. But Iran, according 
to a State Department report of 1999, is the most active state 
sponsor of terrorism " training and arming groups from all over 
the Mideast, including Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah. 
Nor is Irans government now moderating" Five months ago, 
the worlds leading terrorist groups resolved to unite in a holy 
war against the U.S., which they called a second Israel; their 
meeting was held in Teheran. (Fox News 9/16/01)
What has been the U.S. response to the above? in 1996, 
nineteen U.S. soldiers were killed in their barracks in Saudi 
Arabia. According to a front-page story in The New York 
Times (6/21/98): Evidence suggesting that Iran sponsored 
the attack has further complicated the investigation, because 
the United States and Saudi Arabia have recently sought to 
improve relations with a new, relatively moderate Government 
in Teheran. In other words, Clinton evaded Irans role because 
he wanted what he called a genuine reconciliation. In public, 
of course, he continued to vow that he would find and punish 
the guilty. This inaction of Clintons is comparable to his action 
after bin Ladens attack on U.S. embassies in East Africa; his 
action was the gingerly bombing of two meaningless targets.
Conservatives are equally responsible for todays crisis, as 
Reagans record attests. Reagan not only failed to retaliate 
after 241 U.S. marines in Lebanon were slaughtered; he did 
worse. Holding that Islamic guerrillas were our ideological 
allies because of their fight against the atheistic Soviets, he 
methodically poured money and expertise into Afghanistan. 
This put the U.S. wholesale into the business of creating 
terrorists. Most of them regarded fighting the Soviets as only 
the beginning; our turn soon came.
For over a decade, there was another guarantee of 
American impotence: the notion that a terrorist is alone 
responsible for his actions, and that each, therefore, must be 
tried as an individual before a court of law. This viewpoint, 
thankfully, is fading; most people now understand that terrorists 
exist only through the sanction and support of a government
We need not prove the identity of any of these creatures, 
because terrorism is not.an issue of personalities. It cannot 
be stopped by destroying bin Laden and the al-Qaeda army, 
or even by destroying the destroyers everywhere. If that is all 
we do, a new army of militants will soon rise up to replace the 
old one.
The behavior of such militants is that of the regimes which 
make them possible. Their atrocities are not crimes, but acts 
of war. The proper response, as the public now understands, 
is a war in self-defense. In the excellent words of Paul 
Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defense, we must end states 
who sponsor terrorism.
A proper war in self-defense is one fought without selfcrippling restrictions placed on our commanders in the field, it 
must be fought with the most effective weapons we possess 
(a few weeks ago, Rumsfeld refused, correctly, to rule out 
nuclear weapons). And it must be fought in a manner that 
secures victory as quickly as possible and with the fewest 
U.S. casualties, regardless of the countless innocents caught 
in the line of fire. These innocents suffer and die because 
of the action of their own government in sponsoring the 
initiation of force against America. Their fate, therefore, is their 
governments moral responsibility. There is no way for our 
bullets to be aimed only at evil men.
The public understandably demands retaliation against 
Afghanistan. But in the wider context Afghanistan is 
insignificant. It is too devastated even to breed many fanatics. 
Since it is no more these days than a place to hide, its 
elimination would do little to end terrorism.
If our appeasement 
has led to an 
escalation of disasters 
in the past, can it 
do otherwise in the
m * mmmg m gfuture? The survival 
of America is at stake.
The risk of a U.S. 
overreaction, therefore, 
is negligible. The only 
risk is underreaction.
Terrorism is a specific disease, which can be treated only 
by a specific antidote. The nature of the disease (though not 
of its antidote) has been suggested by Serge Schmemann 
(NYT 9/16/01). Our struggle now, he writes, is not a struggle 
against a conventional guerrilla force, whose yearning for a 
national homeland or the satisfaction of some grievance could 
be satisfied or denied. The terrorists [on Tuesday]... issued 
no demands, no ultimatums. They did it solely out of grievance 
and hatredhatred for the values cherished in the West as 
freedom, tolerance, prosperity, religious pluralism and universal 
suffrage, but abhorred by religious fundamentalists (and not 
only Muslim fundamentalists) as licentiousness, corruption, 
greed and apostasy.
Every word of this is true. The obvious implication is that 
the struggle against terrorism is not a struggle over Palestine. 
It is a clash of cultures, and thus a struggle of ideas, which can 
be dealt with, ultimately, only by intellectual means. But this 
fact does not depreciate the crucial role of our armed forces. 
On the contrary, it increases their effectiveness, by pointing 
them to the right target.
Most of the Mideast is ruled by thugs who would be 
paralyzed by an American victory over any of their neighbors. 
Iran, by contrast, is the only major country there ruled by 
zealots dedicated not to material gain (such as more wealth or 
territory), but to the triumph by any means, however violent, of 
the Muslim fundamentalist movement they brought to life. That 
is why Iran manufactures the most terrorists.
If one were under a Nazi aerial bombardment, it would be 
senseless to restrict oneself to combatting Nazi satellites while
ignoring Germany and the ideological plague it was working to 
spread. What Germany was to Nazism in the 1940s, Iran is to 
terrorism today. Whatever else it does, therefore, the U.S. can 
put an end to the Jihad-mongers only by taking out Iran.
Eliminating Irans terrorist sanctuaries and military capability 
is not enough. We must do the equivalent of de-Nazifying the 
country, by expelling every official and bringing down every 
branch of its government. This goal cannot be achieved 
painlessly, by weaponry alone. It requires invasion by ground 
troops, who will be at serious risk, and perhaps a period of 
occupation. But nothing less will end the state that most cries 
out to be ended.
The greatest obstacle to U.S. victory is not Iran and its 
allies, but our own intellectuals. Even now, they are advocating 
the same ideas that caused our historical paralysis. They are 
asking a reeling nation to show neighbor-love by shunning 
vengeance." The multiculturalistsrejecting the concept of 
objectivityare urging us to understand the Arabs and avoid 
racism" (i.e., any condemnation of any groups culture). The 
friends of peace are reminding us, ever more loudly, to 
remember Hiroshima and beware the sin of pride.
These are the kinds of voices being heard in the 
universities, the churches, and the media as the country 
recovers from its first shock, and the professoriate et al. feel 
emboldened to resume business as usual. These voices are 
a siren song luring us to untroubled sleep while the fanatics 
proceed to gut America.
Tragically, Mr. Bush is attempting a compromise between 
the peoples demand for a decisive war and the intellectuals 
demand for appeasement.
Although the Bush administration has now launched an 
attack on bin Ladens organization in Afghanistan and even 
against the Taliban, the administration refuses to target Iran, or 
any of the other countries identified by the State Department 
as terrorist regimes. On the contrary, Powell is seeking to 
add to the current coalition these very stateswhich is the 
equivalent of going into partnership with the Soviet Union in 
order to fight Communism (under the pretext, say, of proving 
that we are not anti-Russian). By seeking such a coalition, our 
President is asserting that he needs the support of terrorist 
nations in order to fight them. He is stating publicly that the 
worlds only superpower does not have enough self-confidence 
or moral courage to act unilaterally in its own defense.
For some days now, Mr. Bush has been downplaying 
the role of our military, while praising the same policies 
(mainly negotiation and economic pressure) that have failed so 
spectacularly and for so long. Instead of attacking the roots 
of global terrorism, he seems to be settling for a guerrilla 
war against al-Qaeda, and a policy of unseating the Taliban 
passively, by aiding a motley coalition of native tribes. Our 
battle, he stresses, will be a lengthy one.
Mr. Bushs compromise will leave the primary creators of 
terrorism wholeand unafraid. His approach might satisfy 
our short-term desire for retribution, but it will guarantee 
catastrophe in the long term.
As yet, however, no overall policy has been solidified; the 
administration still seems to be groping. And an angry public 
still expects our government not merely to hobble terrorism for 
a while, but to eradicate it. The only hope left is that Mr. Bush 
will listen to the public, not to the professors and their progeny.
When should we act, if not now? if our appeasement has 
led to an escalation of disasters in the past, can it do otherwise 
in the future? Do we wait until our enemies master nuclear, 
chemical, and biological warfare?
The survival of America is at stake.. The risk of a 
U.S. overreaction, therefore, is negligible. The only risk 
is underreaction.
Mr. Bush must reverse course. He must send our missiles 
and troops, in force, where they belong. And he must justify 
this action by declaring with righteous conviction that we have 
discarded the clichs of our paper-tiger past and that the U.S. 
now places America first.
There is still time to demonstrate that we take the war 
against terrorism seriouslyas a sacred obligation to our 
Founding Fathers, to every victim of the men who hate this 
country, and to ourselves. There is still time to make the 
world understand that we will take up arms, anywhere and on 
principle, to secure an Americans right to life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness on earth.
The choice today is mass death in the United States or 
mass death in the terrorist nations. Our Commander-In-Chief 
must decide whether it is his duty to save Americans or the 
governments who conspire to kill them.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 5, 2001An
Tartans capitalize on penalties to win at home
GCC, from page A12 
Wolverines first scoring drive, cap
ping it off with a 35 yard run that 
broke multiple tackle attempts by 
CMU defenders.
[Roberts] is a good, shifty 
back, said head coach Rich 
Lackner. Unfortunately, on top of 
that, we did not do a very good job 
of tackling him either. Roberts 
ended the game with a game high 
138 yards.
CMU responded, but not until 
the middle of the second quarter. 
Senior Jeff Stolper had a nice 18 
yard scamper to bring the Tartans 
closer, and sophomore Michael 
Palmers kick knotted the score at 
seven apiece.
For the rest of the half, the teams 
battled back and forth, but no 
points were scored. Grove City was
able to put something together 
halfway through the third quarter.
Roberts was at it again, this time 
setting himself up for a three yard 
touchdown run with his lengthy 
previous run of 32 yards. Roberts 
continued to steamroll the CMU 
defense until that touchdown, 
when thereafter the Tartans basi
cally shut him down for the remain
der of the contest.
The Tartans got behind senior 
captain Eric Zimpfer and sopho
more Ricardo Clarke and started to 
march down the field. Clarke had a 
few nice runs, eventually on his 
way to 114 yards on 19 carries. 
Unfortunately, the Tartans were

field goal by Palmer, making the

Grove City defeated themselves late in the game by taking a string of fool

big at Harvest Relays
RELAYS, from page A12 
We still did a really good job.
The event, which consisted pri
marily of relay races, really tested 
the teamwork of the Tartans. 
However, both teams showed that 
they were up to the challenge, as 
the CMU contingent broke a total 
of eight meet records  one by the 
womens team, and seven by the 
men.
It was just a wild performance, 
said Belowich. We had a great 
time.
In addition to the standard relay 
events, which include freestyle, 
backstroke, and the like, the 
Harvest Relays included some spe
cial events. For example, teams 
..participated in a crescendo relay, 
wherein the first member swims 100 yards, the second swims 200 
yards, and so on.
Another different type of relay 
was the 8x25 yard race, which is 
novel partly for the fact that it is 
seldom seen in
Usually, nobody races the 25 for 
real, said Belowich. You usually
just do those in practice.
Of course, the Tartans were 
ready for this one as well, and even 
found ways to make the event more 
enjoyable.
We usually have a lot of fun with 
these in practice, said Belowich. 
We made these even more fun by 
having little competitions amongst 
ourselves. ,
All in all, the meet was a good 
outing for both teams, who had the 
chance to test their skill and have 
some fun at the same time. The 
Tartans next challenge, though, 
promises to be a good one.
They host the CMU Invitational 
this upcoming Saturday and 
Sunday, and the list of participants 
includes such formidable schools 
as Emory, Johns Hopkins, Case 
Western, and NYU.
Its one of the most competitive 
meets in the country for this time of 
year, said Belowich. The top five 
schools from last years UAAs will 
be present, and it should be a good 
meet.
Woods finishes year 
with lowest average
HOUSTON (AP)  Tiger Woods 
won the Vardon Trophy on 
Sunday, the third consecutive sea
son he has had the lowest scoring 
average on the PGA Tour.
Woods also won the PGA Tour 
money title for the third straight 
season, making him the first play
er since Tom Watson from 1977-79 
to sweep golfs two biggest indica
tors for three straight years.
It wasnt quite as good as last 
year, but it was still a pretty darn 
good year, Woods said after fin
ishing the Tour Championship in a 
tie for 13th.
Woods was coming off a recordsetting season, winning 12 times 
around the world  nine of those 
on the PGA Tour  including 
three straight majors.
He set the record for the adjust
ing scoring average at 68.17, and 
won the Vardon Trophy this year 
with an average adjusted score of 
68.81. Davis Love III was second at 
69.06.
Woods won the money title with 
nearly $5.7 million, down from 
$9.1 million last year.
When I won 12 times around 
the world ... its kind of hard to 
duplicate, Woods said.
Still, he had few complaints.
Woods won five times on the 
PGA Tour, twice more than anyone 
else. He went five tournaments 
without winning  the longest he 
has gone to start a season in his 
professional career  but then 
won three straight.
The last of those was the
biggest, a two-shot victory at the 
Masters that made him the first 
player to win four straight profes
sional majors.
I had a chance to do something 
no one has ever done before in our 
sport, and I somehow was able to 
pull it off, Woods said. Thats 
something Ill always remember. 
This year has been a successful 
year.
Woods had only one top-10 fin
ish since early June, winning the 
NEC Invitational at Firestone in a 
seven-hole playoff over Jim Furyk.
He already has clinched the PGA 
of Americas player of the year 
award, which is based on points 
for victories, money earned and 
scoring average. He is a big 
favorite to win the PGA Tours 
award, which is decided by a vote 
of the players.
The tours other awards also will 
be voted on later this month.
Leading candidates for rookie of 
the year include U.S. Open cham
pion Retief Goosen, two-time win
ner Jose Coceres of Argentina and 
Charles Howell, who began the 
season with no status and nearly 
earned enough money to qualify 
for the Tour Championship.
The comeback player of the year 
figures to be a choice between 
Bernhard Langer, who qualified 
for the Tour Championship for the 
first time since its inception in 
1987, and John Daly, who had four 
top-10s this year and won nearly as 
much money as his past five years 
combined.

Rams impressive start not really that impressive
RAMS, from page A12
However, the balance of teams in 
the NFL makes the likelihood of it 
happening extremely low, and it 
makes one wonder as to why we go 
through this every single season.
Since 1997, the'following teams 
have won their first six games: the 
1997 Broncos, the 1998 Broncos, 
the 1998 Vikings, the 1999 Rams, 
the 2000 Rams, the 2000 Vikings, 
and the 2001 Rams. Of those 
teams, only one managed to win 
more than their first seven games
 the 1998 Broncos, who became 
; the third team in history to begin a 
season 13-0 before dropping their 
, next two on the road.
No team in history has played a 
full 16-game schedule and gone 
unbeaten, and there are a few rea
sons why. Here are some numbers:
In order to finish a perfect sea
son, a team must finish 19-0, 
including the playoffs. So how 
many teams have ever scored 19 
consecutive wins, including play
offs, over any period of time (span
ning multiple seasons)? None. The 
record for that category is 18 wins,
achieved by several teams, most 
recently the 1997-8 Denver 
Broncos.
In order to finish a perfect sea
son, a team must win sixteen con
secutive regular season games. So 
how many teams have ever record
ed 16 consecutive regular season 
wins, over any period of time 
(again, spanning multiple sea
sons)? Four. Only two (1971-3 
Dolphins, 1983-4 Dolphins) of 
those teams achieved it after the 
NFL-AFL merger.
Basically, few teams (none if we 
count playoffs) have ever won 
enough consecutive games through 
the middle of seasons, let alone 
have ever put it all together from 
start to finish in one season.
There is little margin for error in 
having a perfect season. Everyone 
knows, by now, about the so-called 
parity in the NFL, where the 
woeful Bengals can beat the 
defending champion Ravens if 
everything goes right.
So why do we make a huge deal 
every time a team starts off with 
five or six wins? Two things: per
ceived winnable games and the 
ability to thrive under adversity.
Recently, ESPNs Dan Patrick 
wrote an article claiming that the 
Rams had a decent chance to go 
undefeated. The reasoning? Every 
game the Rams would play for the 
remainder of the season is 
winnable. To that I say, So 
what?
If you are perceived to be the best 
team in the league, every game is 
winnable. Thats no revelation. The 
difference is actually winning those 
games.
While we hear in one ear about 
this great parity that the NFL has 
created in Pete Rozelles image, we 
hear in the other that the Rams 
could very well go undefeated 
because they are the best team in 
the NFL. These notions sure seem 
to clash if you ask me, and since 
this is my article, who cares if you 
ask me.
As for adversity, when the Rams 
won close games in Philadelphia, in 
San Francisco, and at home against 
the Giants, it was supposedly a sign 
that even when everything goes
wrong, the Rams cannot lose. 
However, Id say that in winning 
those games by getting some key 
lucky bounces, the Rams were 
lucky to be 6-0, not unlucky to 
have had so much trouble to get to 
that point.
The ability to thrive under adver
sity is a trait that all great teams 
possess. However, with little mar
gin for error in a balanced league, 
the more adversity a team faces, 
the less likely that team is to over
come it.
Only one team since the 
AFL/NFL merger has ever finished 
a season unbeaten and untied: the 
1972 Miami Dolphins. How did 
they get to that spot? A combina
tion of talent, skill, performance, 
and luck. However, many NFL 
experts consider the 1985 Bears to 
be the greatest NFL team ever, and 
they finished a pathetic 18-1.
The bottom line? Theres more to 
greatness than having a perfect 
season. Give it a rest.
RJ Sikdar shouts out a huge Go 
Broncos Monday night.
ties. The majority of their seven 
penalties for 87 yards were accu
mulated in the fourth quarter, and 
CMU was able to take advantage of 
the cheap play by the Wolverines.
They just werent playing smart 
at all, said Lackner. Perhaps their 
roughing the punter penalty was 
the killer because that gave us the 
ball back and a first down at a cru
cial point in the game.
The blatant penalties proved to 
be deadly for the Wolverines, as the 
Tartans were able to sustain a long, 
clock-eating drive that finally 
ended with a one yard plunge by 
junior Adam Urbanczyk.
The Wolverines got the ball back, 
but the tough CMU defense, led by 
Joe Ciccarelli, stood strong. 
Ciccarelli led all CMU tacklers with 
eight tackles.
The intense, heated game came
to an end with the final score of 
17-14 in favor of the Tartans. They 
were able to keep their composure 
against a dirty Grove City team. 
Now, the Tartans begin to look for
ward to their playoff picture in two 
weeks.
There were too many what-ifs 
to look at last week, said Lackner. 
Now I think we have a better per
spective on our situation. Were 
looking at either the NCAAs or the 
ECACs for postseason play. The 
NCAAs would be good for the kids, 
especially after coming back to win 
three games in a row.
The Tartans cap off regular sea
son play next Saturday in Memphis 
when they play Rhodes College. 
After the 1 pm game is complete, 
the Tartans should have a more 
accurate idea of where they stand 
for postseason play.
Thistledown
Whos Next
Carnegie Mellon (7-1, 3-1 UAA) at Rhodes College (4-5, 2-5 SCAC). 1 
pm. WRCT 88.3 FM.
Last meeting: 1997. CMU 20, Rhodes 13. CMU leads the all-time series 
4-0.
The skinny: While their record has remained stationary from last year, 
Rhodes College can take solace in defeating UAA champion Washington 
University. The Lynx were clobbered by Wash U in 2000, 48-7. All this 
is moot if senior LB Mike Hubbert is correct that the transitive property 
doesnt apply to football. Wash U defeated the Tartans 17-7 at 2001 
Homecoming.
Rhodes stands almost statistically even in most offensive and defensive 
categories with their 2001 opponents. One glaring discrepancy is the 
teams rushing defense. Rhodes has permitted a respectable 100 yards 
rushing per game. The Tartans will enter the matchup with one of the 
most feared rushing attacks in Division III (253.1 yards a game). Most 
teams have chosen to completely dismantle the Rhodes secondary, 
passing for 267 yards a game. Last week, Millsaps College passed for 
over 200 yards and rushed for 138 en route to a squeaker 28-27 victo
ry over the Lynx.
Watch for: Lynx junior RB Tyler Barklow averages over 5 yards a carry, 
but sees a mere slice of the Lynx rushing attack. Senior LB Chris Huff has 
registered four sacks and leads the team with 61 tackles. Tartan QB Eric 
Zimpfer left late in the fourth quarter for a short period of time and 
slinged only four passes. His lone completion was to junior Slash 
Sebastian Smelko for 13 yards.
Result: The Scots travel to Memphis for their last regular season game. 
A loss would undoubtedly eliminate their NCAA postseason hopes. Can 
the Kardiac Kilties continue their amazing string of comeback wins? 
You can hope and pray that it will be Tartan-terrific from the opening 
kickoff, but CMU hasnt steamrolled an opponent since Franklin and 
Marshall. Last week, Rhodes went for two and the win against Millsaps. 
They will again go for the two, but it wont be for the win. CMU 21, 
Rhodes 15. Dont ask how it happens. It just does.
Game Notes
The Steve Roberts Band: Grove City fullback Steve Roberts carried the 
ball on 26 occasions for 138 yards. His second-effort runs were easily 
the most impressive performance against the Tartan defense.
EZ Topp: Hes got legs and he knows how to use them. Zimpfer left the 
pocket 11 times on his own accord for 50 yards (66 net yards). 
Zimpfers improv routine keyed a drive that was finished by a nifty 18 
yard prance by senior FB Jeff Stopler.
Special snafu: CMU's punt return squad had difficulty fielding the boots 
of GCC punter Mike Titzel. He averaged launches of 39.2 yards, but 
none of his five punts traveled more than 25 yards in the air. The 
Tartans had only two punt returns for 15 yards.
Penalty Power: Some Saturday observers might charge that Carnegie 
Mellon didnt necessarily win the contest, but that Grove City lost it. 
CMU began its final drive at its own 12 yard line, but moved only five 
yards before Laird Stabler came on to punt. Grove City returned the ball 
the CMU 45 yard line, but the play was nullified because of a roughing 
the kicker penalty. On the next down, Ricardo Clarke rushed for five 
yards, but was speared after the play was dead. Another 15 yards 
moved the Skibos to the Grove City 47. A late hit out of bounds on 
Clarke gave the Tartans a fresh set of downs inside the 20. On fourth 
and goal, Smelko passed for a falling Drew Garrod at the goal line. His 
pass was incomplete, but a pass interference set the table for the Adam 
Urbanczyk winning touchdown.

Undefeated 
season not 
very likely
120 Yards
by RJ Sikdar
Jordans return. The World 
Series. Saints beat the Rams in a 
thriller. This past week was the 
first, and likely last, time that I will 
ever see professional football, bas
ketball, baseball, and hockey all at 
once.
MJs back, and its exciting to see, 
as Ive said several times in this 
NFL-related column. Its too bad 
that we have to see the rest of his 
team, but at least we get to hear the 
great debate  If Jordan takes the 
Wiz to the playoffs, is that better 
than winning the championship 
with the Bulls? I say, No way, 
dude  you just cant top champi
onships. But at least he can come 
back and have some fun.
The Wiz should trade for Pippen 
and go for the championship, any
way. Unless youre one of those 
who thinks Jordan won six champi
onships by himself.
Working on deadline, I dont 
know yet who won Game Seven of 
the World Series, but Im sure it 
was great nonetheless. Its great 
news for writers, at the very least. If 
the D-Backs won, you get two 
major storylines. First, they pulled 
off an incredible comeback after 
losing three heartbreakers in New 
York. Second, they did it on the 
strength of power pitching from 
Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, 
which no doubt could be a blue
print for future baseball champi
ons.
If the Yankees won, its even bet
ter news. First, you get the senti
mental trash stories about how this 
helps heal the city of New York (no 
matter how ridiculous the argu
ment  does this mean the 
Giants/Jets, Islanders/Rangers, 
and Knicks deserve it too?). 
Second, you get the dynasty and 
destiny stories that weve come to 
know and love over the past five 
years. Third, you get the whiners 
who cry about the imbalance in 
baseball and dismiss the accom
plishments of the Yankees  never 
mind that if money were the most 
important factor in winning, the 
loaded Dodgers and Red Sox surely 
would have made the playoffs this 
year.
But anyway, basketball and hock
ey have just started, baseball is 
over, and this column couldnt care 
less about any of those weird sports 
anyway.
Finally, the unbeaten watch 
has ended in the NFL. The notion 
that the St. Louis Rams would run 
the table after starting 6-0 is final
ly dead, and good riddance. The 
idea that a team could go 19-0 is 
not necessarily a ridiculously bad 
one, and one day it will happen  
since everything will happen even
tually.

Injured Davenport pulls out of Sanex
MUNICH, Germany (AP)  One 
day after claiming the No. 1 rank
ing, Lindsay Davenport pulled out 
of the Sanex Championships final 
with a knee injury Sunday, handing 
the title to Serena Williams.
Davenport aggravated a bruised 
right knee that sidelined her earlier 
this year in Saturdays semifinal 
win against Kim Clijsters at the $3 
million, year-ending event.
I cant tell you how bad I feel for 
everyone involved, but I cant put 
any weight on it, Davenport said. 
Id really rather play and lose, but 
I cant.
The injury will sideline her indef
initely and could affect her prepa
ration for the 2002 season, which 
starts in January.
She was out of action for nearly 12 weeks with the original injury, 
which she suffered in March in 
Miami, then returned just before 
Wimbledon.
Its much more painful than it 
was in that match, Davenport 
said. At least I could finish a set 
then.
Davenport said she felt two 
bones knock together in her knee at 
5-2 in the tiebreaker against 
Clijsters, a thrilling match she won 
1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (3) to pass Jennifer 
Capriati and claim the No. 1 spot.
She was chasing a drop shot from
Clijsters at the time.
Right there I knew I did some
thing that hurt my knee, 
Davenport said.
She was able to play out the 
match, but broke off practice hours 
before the final because of the 
pain.
It was the second time Davenport 
ended the year topping the rank
ings. She also finished 1998 as No. 1.
Pulling out of the final ended 
Davenports 15-match winning 
streak that gave her three titles in 
three weeks. She pulled out shortly 
before the title match had been 
slated to start.

Ricardo Clarke averaged 6.0 yards a carry as the Tartans rushed to success behind RT David Stein, RG Chad Zimmerman, and center Bob Barton.
Last Saturday, with the compa
ny of an enormous crowd, the 
Tartans hosted Grove City College 
at Gesling Stadium. It was a true 
nail-biter that had CMU finally 
getting the upper hand with a 
score of 17-14.
The game against the 
Wolverines was more than just a 
regular home game. There was an 
unusual amount of fans because of 
a new Youth Football Day created 
by the Tartans.
On this day, the Tartans extend
ed an invitation to several local 
Pittsburgh youth football groups 
to come down to the CMU game, 
get a free t-shirt, and interact with 
a few college football players. It 
was a great opportunity for the 
younger kids to have while at the 
same time raising attendance for 
the Tartans.
The Tartans went on to show the 
CMU fans a good game. What 
started out as a shaky CMU begin
ning would transform to a more 
stable ending, characterized by 
strong defensive stands to help 
fend off Grove City.
One man dominated the first 
quarter, like much of the game for 
Grove City: Steve Roberts. He ran 
all over the Tartans on the

football game, where they also
received a free t-shirt, a plaid 
Tartan power towel, and a free 
game-day program.
There were lots of other attrac
tions for the kids, including facepainting, balloon animals, hot 
chocolate, and smiley cookies.
Afterwards they had an oppor
tunity to hang out with the play
ers, who were also happy to hand 
out autographs.
As members of the mens ath
letics special interest housing, we
have a community service goal, 
said junior Scott Jubeck, one of 
the members. Usually that just 
entails things like reading to kids. 
We wanted to do a bigger event to 
really touch the community. Since 
all eight of us in the housing are 
football players, this seemed like 
the perfect event.
The six teams that were invited 
were the Center Lil Trojans, the 
Northside Saints, the PennTrafford Warriors, the Derry Area
Trojans, Morningside, and youth 
from Oakland. Over 150 kids 
came to the event, bringing their 
parents and providing a very large 
turnout.
I think it went very well, 
added Jubeck. There was a won
derful turnout, probably between 
300 and 500 people total with the 
parents, and everyone was very 
enthusiastic. It was great to see 
the kids having fun and being able 
to hang out with the bigger foot
ball players.
All present agreed that nobody 
got more out of the event than the 
children.
According to senior Lara Panis, 
CA for the housing group, It went 
fabulous. The kids seemed to have 
a grand old time. It was really 
great to see them get in a huddle 
every time the players came out 
and give a Go Tartans cheer.
You could just tell that they 
were really into and having fun.

John Cassavetes is known as the 
father of independent American cin

most important figures in the histo
ry of film. This indie flick inspired by 
him inhabits the milieu of the indie 
rock music scene in the postNirvanaage. Comprised of both live

ten bands featured in the movie 
include the Peechees, the Make-Up,

* Fat Girl (France, 2001)
Catherine Breillat is maybe the 
most controversial director working 
in France today and her new film, 
Fat Girl, more than lives up to her 
reputation. The film just won the 
top prize at the Chicago 
International Film Festival and also 
played at Toronto and Telluride, 
where it was the centerpiece of a 
tribute to Breillat. The very disturb
ing film is about the ugly duckling 
sister of a gorgeous teenager discov
ering her sexuality with a predatory 
male. The theme of teenage female 
sexuality is dominant in Breillats 
work, and she deals with it in an 
See FILM, page B2
that there are not, by and large, and hard and 
fast rules.
Consider for instance, a story that ran two 
weeks ago on Philadelphias citypaper.net, 
which tells of a 22-year-old man denied board
ing on two separate flights to Phoenix simply 
because of the book he carried. The reason for 
the furor? The cover of his novel, Edward 
Abbeys Hayduke Lives!, depicts a man holding 
sticks of dynamite. Many airlines are also 
engaging in racial profiling, as Sikhs like 
Gurmeet Singh can attest to. Singh was not per
mitted to pass through a security checkpoint 
until his luggage and laptop were handsearched, and his turban, comprised of 15 feet 
of cloth, was unwrapped on the spot  a viola
tion of his religious beliefs  and inspected in 
Albanys airport.
While such incidents arent quite the norm, 
its clear that anythings possible during this 
tense time in our nation. Two general changes 
that seem to be present at any given airport 
include more frequent searches and metal 
detector scans of random passengers and their 
baggage, and being required to show photo 
identification, typically three times or more, at 
multiple checkpoints. Federal guidelines pro
hibit anyone without a ticket to fly from passing 
beyond airport entrances, so random shopping 
at the airport mall is pretty much out of the 
question, as is greeting or seeing off travelers at 
the gate. On my recent flight from 
Philadelphia, for instance, my father was not 
permitted to accompany me to the gate to 
ensure I boarded on time (we arrived with only 
90 minutes to spare, which many people report 
is insufficient given increased security mea
sures), despite showing several forms of ID and 
having his name and credit card information on 
the ticket.
More seriously, in several airports, includ
ing Pittsburgh International, the presence of 
National Guardsmen is particularly notice
able. The efficacy of new security measures, 
however, is questionable. One Tartan staff 
members parents made it through six security 
checkpoints while carrying each others 
boarding pass. The random search process is 
also reportedly frustrating to travelers, as one 
student told of her bags being rifled through 
twice and having to stand, arms and legs 
spread, as a metal detector wand was passed 
over her body, while other passengers simply 
had to walk through one metal detector, no 
questions asked.
Finally, some travel experiences are weird or
just plain excessive, such as sit-down restau
rants inside the airport using only plastic knives
 try cutting your steak with that! Another 
Tartan staff members relatives flew from New 
York to Washington, DC, with no one being per
mitted to stand up for 35 minutes of the 39 
minute flight, a command that caused some 
tension when a man tried to use the bathroom

experiences are weird or

and was denied by flight attendants. And on my 
way back to Pittsburgh, I was ordered to 
remove my baseball cap and re-walk through 
the metal detector again, despite the hat not 
causing any apparent problem the first time I 
came through.
This brief sampling of perspectives from 
local students and family members, vacation
ers and business travelers alike, illustrates the 
fear that still pervades our society. While some 
individuals have been subjected to luggage 
searcnes, police interrogations, and flight 
delays, others have reported seemingly 
straightforward experiences. Some people 
have waited in line for two or more hours to 
check in, while others said this happened rel
atively quickly. For me, the bottom line was 
that I still had to walk onto a plane and spend 
the next hour of my life wishing I was back on 
the ground, despite wonderful service from 
the entire crew. Air marshals may be put on 
every flight and security measures may con
tinue to heighten, but the truest test any 
American will face is their willingness to over
come fear and get back into the skies  and to 
balance patience with concern for personal 
rights as we greet the airline travel of the 
twenty-first century.
Navartri unites campus in 
intercultural celebration
by Jesse Dubus
Junior Staffwriter
In the twenty years of its exis
tence, the Three Rivers Film Festival 
has always been one of the most 
important annual film events of the 
year in Pittsburgh. Although taking 
place in November just after highprofile international festivals in 
Toronto, Venice, New York, and 
Telluride, it has never been a seri
ous part of the festival circuit. 
Periodically changing its format in 
an effort to reconcile high ambi
tions with a relatively low profile 
and low budget, it has, for the most 
part, been a means of showcasing 
releases that otherwise might not 
be programmed in Pittsburgh. The 
Festival has traditionally not been 
seen as an event that reflected on 
directors and films were making 
waves on the international scene.
Thats why this years festival, 
which started Friday at Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers three theaters, is so 
exciting. With major corporate 
sponsorship from Dollar Bank, 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, one of the 
most forward-thinking arts organi
zations in the city, has put together 
what is probably the most ambitious 
and promising festival in its history.
The twentieth film festival is also 
in part a celebration of Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers own 30th anniversary. 
It is fitting that they have incorpo
rated experimental film and a 
sense of social consciousness, two 
crucial parts of the institutions
identity, into this years event. In 
the span of 17 days, the festival will 
include films fresh from the fall fes
tival circuit, several premieres of 
features made by local filmmakers, 
special screenings presented by 
guest film and videomakers, new 
prints of classic films, and, of 
course, an anniversary party for 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
Screenings are held at the Regent 
Square Theater (1035 S. Braddock 
Avenue) in Edgewood, the Harris 
Theater (809 Liberty Avenue) 
downtown, and the Melwood 
Screening Room (477 Melwood 
Avenue) in North Oakland. All the
aters are easily accessible by bus. 
Maps and additional information 
about the festival can be found at: 
http ://www.pghfi Immakers.o rg/ 
filmfest/index2. html.
The following is a rundown of 
the some of the films featured the 
first week. Programs with an * are 
highly recommended.
HARRIS THEATER:
* Billy Liar (UK, 1963)
Perhaps the defining film of the 
British new wave, this film tells the 
story of a pathological liar who 
invents his own truth to make up for 
the disappointment of his life. The 
early 60s may have been the most 
vital era of British filmmaking and 
this film is even called one of the 
best from any country during that 
decade. The movie was directed by 
John Schlesinger, who went on to 
make Midnight Cowboy in 1969, and 
features the first major role for Julie
Students performed Surgeon of Honor last week from Wednesday to Friday. The studio show was directed 
by Habib Azar, a fifth year drama major.

and the need for enhanced security. Proposed 
changes to air travel range from a ban on curbside check-in to the implementation of a 
national ID card, but most long-term changes 
have yet to be decided and put into practice. 
Americans are still waiting, and watching, as 
the world attempts to return to normal, but 
is it possible?
While much has been publicized regarding 
the hard facts of post-September 11 air travel 
| carry-ons are still permitted on all airlines,
' for instance, but the contents of ones lugS gage are subject to greater scrutiny  little
r focus has been directed to the mood prevail
ing on the flights themselves, or of the 
( nuances experienced by travelers on particu
lar routes or carriers. Indeed, one of the 
defining features of flying during this time is
mation systems and economics 
major. Some of my friends were 
enthusiastic about teaching myself 
and others the dance steps to the 
Garba and the Dandia-ras which 
made the evening much more 
enjoyable.
It was really nice to see not only 
the Indian community but the over
all campus community unite to cel
ebrate in typical Indian flare and 
style, said Neesha Patel, junior 
information systems major.
I thought it was a wonderful 
event that brought together the 
campus community and brought 
intercultural mingling, said Brian 
Namey, student body vice president 
and junior ethics, history and pub
lic policy major. Its one thing to 
read about various cultures, but its 
wonderful to be able to experience 
it as students could last Friday. 
This annual festival lasts nine 
days and nine nights and is cele
brated in different styles all across 
India. This celebration is the wor
ship of three divine goddesses, 
Saraswati (goddess of learning), 
Lakshmi (goddess of wealth), and 
Durga (goddess of strength). Some 
say it was the also the battle that 
occurred between Goddess
Chaamundeshwari (good) and the 
demon Mahishaasura (evil). The 
battle lasted nine days and nine 
nights and on the tenth day, 
Chaamundeshwari killed
Mahishaasura.

In the days following September 11, when 
shock gave way to anger and the major news 
networks stopped broadcasting live from the 
disaster site, many Americans began to won
der what changes were in store for everyday 
citizens  in essence, how our sense of free
dom and every way of life might be irrevoca
bly changed. Following the terrorist attacks, 
airline earnings plummeted, and the average 
plane in October was filled to only 64 percent 
seating capacity, compared to 70 percent at 
this time last year even when taking into con
sideration the reduction of 20 percent of 
flights scheduled. Today, amidst massive lay
offs and rumors of the federalization of air
port employees, the airline industry is walking 
a fine line between peoples right to privacy

Navaratri, an Indian celebration 
of good versus evil, took place last 
Friday night from 8 pm to midnight 
in the Rangos Ballrooms. About 
150 to 200 people came to cele
brate the event throughout the 
night from all over the Carnegie 
Mellon and Pittsburgh community.
The South Asian Student 
Alliance (SASA) organized the 
annual event this year and over the 
past few years. It consisted of a live 
band and people participating in 
the traditional dances Garba and 
Dandia-ras.
Since this is an annual event, we 
started making preparations for the 
event last spring, starting with try
ing to find a band, said Ankur 
Datta, a junior business major and 
vice president of SASA. This year 
the band included 16 members, 
more than twice the size of last 
year.
Students had a good time at the 
event and enjoyed the experience. 
It went pretty well, the band was 
really good, said Amy Shah, a 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering major. It was good to 
see many new faces this year.
This was my first year attending 
the Navaratri celebration and I 
really enjoyed myself, said

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 5, 2001
25 years ago, November 2, 1976  On 
Wednesday, October 27, the University 
announced a national fund raising campaign 
with a goal of 100 million dollars. It would be 
split among endowed professorships, unre
stricted expenses, financial aid for students, 
new programs, facilities and new construc
tion, and new equipment. Included in this $100 millon goal was an anonymous gift of 
$35 million which was the entire estate of a 
generous benefactor.
Dean Edward Schatz considered lengthen
ing the Universitys calendar. He felt opposi
tion from students and faculty, but claimed he 
wanted to give students their moneys worth 
in education. He mentioned that there used 
to be 75 days in a semester, while there were 
only 67 in the fall term that year. Possible 
changes included scheduling classes for 
Saturdays, zero final exam days, and/or start
ing on September 1 every year regardless of 
Labor day.
10 years ago, November 4, 1991  
Construction for the new GSIA building was
still on time. The cement for the first floor 
was set last week and upcoming activities 
include pouring concrete floor decks, and 
continued installation of the steamline and 
mechanical and electrical systems. 
Construction was set to finish in November 
of 1992.
The Carnegie Science Center opened 
around this time with a innovative 
Amusement Park for the Mind logo to entice 
new visitors. Exhibits include an Omnimaic 
theater, Body Tech, Henry Buhl Jr. 
Planetarium and Observatory, and an Eating 
Exhibit.
Five years ago, November 4,1996  Four 
undergraduates, Richard Bodnar, Bounmy 
Phouthavong, Justin Filder, and Douglas 
Hudson took second place in a national case 
challenge presented by Electronic Data 
Services (EDS). The faced competition from 
41 of the best collegiate business schools across 
the country.
Carnegie Mellon was the host to Computer 
Expo 96. The University Center featured
exhibits from computer vendors and school 
researchers. The purpose was to inform stu
dents of products in the industry. Vendors 
included Apple, Dell, IBM, Hewlett Packard, 
Digital, Sun, Adobe, Microsoft, Iomega, Silicon 
Graphics, Bell Atlantic Mobile, Compaq, US 
Robotics, and D&H Distributing (an education
al reseller).
One year ago, November 6, 2000  The 
University considered moving the Career 
Center from its location in the basement of 
Warner Hall to an annex within the University 
Center.
Students, faculty, and family mourned the 
death of a first-year student. A first-year 
Science and Humanities student passed away 
on October 31.
The large red LCD sign on the Purnell Center 
of the Arts was designated as a place to feature 
the work of student poetry.

FILM, from page B1
extremely eroticized fashion that would probably be 
impossible for a male filmmaker to get away with. Shock 
value is certainly an important part of Breillats talent, 
along with an uncanny knack for filming love scenes 
that seem to raise the temperatures in screening rooms 
while capturing the awkwardness of sexual awakening. 
Fat Girl has a violently shocking ending that elicited an 
equally violent response from the audience I saw it with, 
in what was probably the most intense reaction from an 
audience Ive ever seen.

Signs and Wonders (France, 2001)
This film by Jonathan Nossiter, whose Sunday won 
the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance several years ago, 
stars Stellan Skarsgard and Charlotte Rampling as an 
American couple living in Greece and dealing with the 
ravages of mental illness. Despite the relative coolness 
with which the film has been received in Chicago and 
New York, any movie with Skarsgard and Rampling is 
worth seeing. The two actors are easily among the best 
working today. The two also starred in the recent 
Aberdeen, an excellent film that is similar in some ways 
to this one, and Rampling is still relatively fresh off of 
Under the Sand, a milestone in her career.

MELWOOD SCREENING ROOM:
* Bob, le Flambeur (France, 1955)
Loosely translated as Bob, the incredibly self
destructive high roller, this French noir is as good as 
any American film of the genre. The director, JeanPierre Melville, was almost a patron saint to the 
Nouvelle Vague directors. One of the few French direc
tors who flaunted national cinematic conventions, 
Truffauts certaine tendance was most definitely not 
found in Melvilles oeuvre. When he wasnt Allowed 
into the French directors union, Melville started his 
own studio in the suburbs of Paris and was famous for 
driving around in a convertible wearing a cowboy hat. 
The story is a typical noir thread, complete with one 
last heist and a proper femme fatale (In fact, the film is 
even more sexist than most noirs). But its the treat
ment that makes it special. The romance of 
Montmartre by moonlight and neon is palpable. This is 
the movie that P. T. Anderson shamelessly stole from in 
his debut feature, Hard Eight. Go see why.
Showing: Monday, November 5 at 9:30 pm 
Women in Animated Media From Early 
Cinema to Cable TV '
Local artist T. Foley presents a critical analysis of the 
way women are presented in animation. Using a broad 
array of clips, Foley will discuss some of the ways that 
women are depicted in them (such as Betty Boops 
original incarnation as a dog) and how women react 
(or dont react) to them. Just returned from a trip to 
Bali, Foley is interviewed in the current issue of City 
Paper and will incorporate a dialogue with the audi
ence into the event. Admission for this event is $3. 
Showing: Tuesday, November 6 at 8 pm,
* The Adventures of Prince Achmed 
(Germany, 1926)
Silent film has been receiving a much deserved 
revival in Pittsburgh in the last year or so. In the last 
month and a half alone there have been four programs 
of silent films with live musical accompaniments, some
thing certainly worth celebrating. This early, animated 
film is the least common of them so far, created by a 23- 
year-old German woman and loosely based on the leg
end of the 1001 nights. Multiple forms of animation 
were experimented with to create the. film. Definitely 
one of the most interesting programs of the festival.
Showing: Friday, November 9 at 7:30 pm; Saturday,

I Remember Me (USA, 2000)
This American documentary investigates chronic 
fatigue syndrome, a disease about which little is 
known although it can be severely debilitating. Kim 
Snyder, the director, suffered from the syndrome her
self and interviews others who suffer from it in an 
attempt to learn more about the mysterious ailment.

REGENT SQUARE THEATER:
* Band of Outsiders (France, 1964)
Jean-Luc Godards neglected early classic has just 
been redistributed and is currently the focus of renewed 
interest. Godard was the intellectual force behind the 
Nouvelle Vague and a seminal figure in the history of 
cinema. Like most of his early work, Godard works in the 
idiom of a genre film, this time the gangster movie, and 
twists it in a way that functions on multiple levels, blaz
ing new cinematic territory. Godards early work also his
lacks the extremely dense experimentation of his cur
rent work. Quentin Tarantino quoted from Band of 
Outsiders liberally in Pulp Fiction, and his enthusiasm for 
the film is evident in the name of his production compa
ny, A Band Apart, taken from the original French title.

The French Connection (USA, 1971)
2001 marks the 30th anniversary for this Oscar-winning film with Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider. The 
film is regarded as one of the best detective films ever, 
and was made during one of the most vibrant periods 
of American film history. The story focuses on a pair of 
New York City cops investigating heroin trafficking 
from France. For those interested in the genre, the 
opportunity to see this AFI 100 film on the big screen 
in its original scope format is invaluable.

the other Protestant. But when their daughters are 
forced to go to Catholic school and her husband does

Computing after the World Trade Center seminar 
addresses surveillance and privacy issues in depth
by Shilpa Desai
Junior Staffwriter
Last Thursdays seminar, Computing after 
the World Trade Center: Surveillance and 
Privacy, was an engaging discussion regard
ing the impact of September 11 on new gov
ernment policies on privacy and surveillance 
(in increasing efforts for the war on terror
ism). This discussion was also an eye-opener 
regarding one question: Is the enhancement of 
law enforcement surveillance worth the loss of 
personal privacy? The distinguished panel of 
speakers included Dr. Mike Shamos, director of 
the Universal Library and principal systems 
scientist in the Language Technologies 
Institute at the School of Computer Science; 
Dr. Dave Touretzky, principal scientist for the 
School of Computer Science; Dr. George 
Duncan, professor of statistics in the Heinz 
School of Public Policy; Dr. Latanya Sweeney, 
an assistant professor in the School of 
Computer Science and in the Heinz School of 
Public Policy; Elaine Newton, a PhD candidate 
in engineering and public policy, and Dr. Illah 
Nourbakhsh, an assistant professor in the 
Robotics Institute. Lenore Blum, distinguished 
career professor of computer science, moderat
ed the discussion, centered around how the 
future of computing could be changed dramat
ically after the events of September 11.
On Friday, October 26, President George 
Bush signed the bill HR 31-62, USA-Patriot 
Act. This bill dramatically altered the govern
ment policy on surveillance (amongst other 
things) in the United States. Dr. Shamos spoke 
in detail about this bill, and provided many 
specifics. The primary motive behind the bill is 
to enhance government capability of determin
ing who is a terrorist; this includes freer per
mission to plant electronic devices that follow 
people around. Before, it was very difficult to 
get permission to legally go about monitoring 
natural-born and naturalized citizens in the 
United States in such a manner, but after the 
bill of October 26, the permission has become 
extremely easy to obtain. The attorney gener
al, or whoever is in charge of the investigation, 
must only show that the monitoring will be
done because it is relevant for the ongoing 
investigation. Note that this bill does not actu
ally violate the Fourth Amendment of the 
Constitution, which protects citizens from 
unreasonable searches and seizures. The 
government does not believe that the new bill 
will violate the Fourth Amendment, because it 
accounts for reasonable searches and seizures. 
The bill also provides for governmental rights 
to ask any educational institution for the 
detailed information about any non-ifnmigrant 
alien student (including identity, academic 
status, disciplinary action taken in past); and 
the definition of an educational institution 
has obviously been extended to include lan
guage training and flight schools. Regarding 
money, the bill now expands the current limit 
on the size of financial transactions that need 
not be reported to $10,000. Lastly, any activi
ties that threaten human life and violate feder
al or state law are now considered acts of ter
rorism.
Dr. Touretzky continued from where Dr. 
Shamos concluded, by pointing out that per
haps giving so much power to the government 
is not really that good. To begin, computer 
hacking has now been redefined as an act of 
terrorism; protest groups such as Operation 
Rescue, Earth First, and WTO protesters will 
now be classified as terrorists and put into the 
same category as bin Ladens people. The 
sneak and peek method of obtaining infor
mation, in which the investigators pry into the 
suspects personal belongings and conduct 
their investigation but never tell the suspect, 
has been given extended permission to cover 
all criminal investigations (not only terrorismrelated investigations). These extensions, 
along with many others that were not men
tioned, seem to be gratuitous and not related 
to truly fighting terrorism. The American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) is very concerned 
about this, and is likely planning to voice its 
objections in the near future. Dr. Touretzky 
validly pointed out that the government is run 
by human beings, and when given too much 
power, humans will tend to misuse that power. 
So in short, the government has really empow
ered itself with this bill, and while an empow
ered government is what most Americans now
want, we must stop to wonder if it has been
o ve r- e mp o we r e d.
The seminar continued with Dr. Duncan 
speaking about using our current technology 
to enhance data privacy and data utility. Dr. 
Sweeny spoke about the need to preserve some 
amount of anonymity even after the events of 
September 11 (since the government can link 
people by their date of birth and zip code to 
their name by simply crossing various data 
bases). Elaine Newton spoke about the devel
opment of the field of biometrics, the field 
which enables people to be identified and 
checked by personal traits such as fingerprints, 
hand shape, facial recognition, and iris scans. 
This field is rapidly growing, especially after 
the recent terrorist attacks. However, Ms. 
Newton pointed out, many adjustments have 
to be made, and the real scans are nothing like 
the movies in which everything transpires 
without a glitch - lots of fine tuning still has to 
be done. Lastly, Dr. Nourbakhsh spoke about 
the development of and new uses for robots 
which will aid in fighting terrorism in the com
ing years.
The seminar concluded with the question, 
What steps should people take to protect our
selves (from the authorities or from terrorism) 
and how should resources be allocated to make 
sure were all safe and to protect the safety of 
others? posed to all panelists who wished to 
respond. The question was answered in part by 
Dr. Touretzky showing that CMU has already 
done a great deal of things, but should take 
further steps to equip the community with PGP 
mail, teach everyone to use encryption, and be 
knowledgeable about the governments 
actions. Dr. Duncan pointed out that even 
though the government does many question
able things, we shouldnt always be under the 
assumption that the government is out to get 
us. Dr. Nourbakhsh stated that whatever is 
done, people should definitely not stick their 
heads in the sand - everyone should be aware 
of whats going on. Dr. Shamos ended on the 
note that we should do a lot of research on 
what our vulnerabilities are, and in terms of 
protecting oneself from the authorities, I think 
thats the Unibomber solution  build your 
own private cabin in Montana and live there.

Carnegie Mellon, University of Pittsburgh scientists will join a group of 
researchers involved in NSF-funded National Virtual Observatory project
by Sriram Vaidhyanathan
Science & Technology Editor
Astronomy grabbed the spotlight this past week, when the National 
Science Foundation announced a grant of $10 million to be awarded to 
the National Virtual Observatory (NVO) project. The generous grant is to 
be shared between 17 institutions in the United States, including Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. The NSF grant, under the 
Information Technology Research (ITR) initiative, is spread over five 
years, and aims to put the universe online.
According to Andrew Moore, the Nico A. Haberman associate professor 
of robotics and computer science, one of the greatest problems faced by 
modern physics is the enormous amount of data being collected and 
requiring analysis. The aim of the project is to clear the path for this analy
sis in such a manner that allows the data to be accessible easily by 
researchers and the general public. The NVO project already has all the 
major archives of astronomy data in the United States on board, and plans 
to include links to similar sites in Europe and Asia.
Moore, along with Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of physics 
Robert C. Nichol and Andrew Connolly, assistant professor of astrophysics 
at the University of Pittsburgh, comprise the Pittsburgh team. The three 
have been collaborating since 1998 when they received a $1.6 million 
grant from NSF to develop algorithms to automate the process of finding
information in astrophysical databases like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
The project, to be headed by astronomer Alex Szalay of Johns Hopkins 
University and computer scientist Paul Messina of California Institute of 
Technology, will unite astronomical databases of many earthbound and 
orbital observatories, taking advantage of the latest computer technology 
and data storage and analysis techniques. The goal is to maximize- the 
potential for new scientific insights from the data by making them avail
able in an accessible, seamlessly unified form to professional researchers, 
amateur astronomers, and students.
Szalay is the Alumni Centennial Professor of Astronomy at Johns 
Hopkinss Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. He commented on the pro
jects importance as describing it to be a new medium of research in sci
ence, namely exploration through computational methods. Advances in 
technology and technique in the field increase the total information 
researchers are able to extract each year from observatories almost 
twofold, and there is an inherent need in the field of astronomy to come 
up with a solution to the problem.
The researchers hope to be able to complete the basic framework for the 
NVO within the five year grant period. The project itself was inspired by 
the Digital Sky Project, led by Caltech computer scientist Tom Prince, 
which is working to make data from four different astronomy databases 
available through one seamless web portal. However, a major challenge 
the researchers on the NVO will have to face is the fact that the data is 
organized very differently on each of the databases set up to archive astro
nomical data. This makes it difficult for the team to perform real-time cal
culations on all the data simultaneously. Grid computing, a technique 
developed in the 1990s is expected to be used here to allow large amounts 
of the data to be remotely shared efficiently.
Andrew Moore is one of the senior personnel on the National Virtual 
Observatory project, which also includes researchers from institutions 
such as California Institute of Technology, the San Diego Supercomputing 
Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Johns Hopkins 
University, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Fermilab, University of 
Pennsylvania, Microsoft Research, Harvard University, and the NSF 
National Optical Astronomy Observatory.
Organizers are planning to keep the NVO virtual - not located in any 
one facility - and accessible enough for non-specialists like science teach
ers or students to use. A major goal for the NVO is to provide a window on 
the universe for students, teachers, backyard astronomers, and the inter
ested public, said Bob Hanisch, NVO project manager at the Space 
Telescope Science Institute. The NVO will enable the public to explore 
directly the wealth of information from society's investment in our nation
al research facilities.
Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the National Science 
Foundation were in the news only a couple of weeks ago with the 
announcement of grants to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, for 
similar interdisciplinary projects in quantum molecular dynamics and 
teleimmersion technology.
Microsoft launches new XP operating system in NY
NEW YORK (AP) - Launching his companys 
biggest product in six years, Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates on Thursday touted the Windows XP 
operating system as the harbinger of a new era 
in more Internet-centric computing.
Critics say, however, that many of the features 
built into XP seek to make computing more 
Microsoft-centric than ever.
Appearing onstage at the Marriott Marquis 
with Rudolph Giuliani, Gates saluted the citys 
mayor and its people for their courage, deter
mination, and resilience and predicted the tech 
industry, in its worst slump ever, would once 
again re-energize the US economy.
Today it really is actually the end of the MSDOS era, Gates told about 1,500 guests and 
media, a reference to Microsofts original oper
ating system, the underpinning of all the com
panys consumer-oriented Windows products 
until XP.
Gates then typed exit on an MS-DOS com
mand line and the projected computer screen 
went fuzzy.
The idea behind Windows XP is to get con
sumers more connected with better Internet 
tools and features including built-in wireless 
networking support.
And that positions Microsoft well. As a 
provider of Web-based services and an operat
ing system owner, it is uniquely positioned to be 
a gatekeeper.
For users, the $99 upgrade to XP Home is 
Microsofts best-yet stab at a user-friendly oper
ating system, with plug-and-play support for a 
plethora of digital gadgets, an emphasis on 
whiz-bang multimedia, and an underlying code
base far more stable than predecessors.
Its got a lot of nice new features. But the 
most important thing is that it really is a stable 
operating system. It doesnt crash, said Michael 
Miller, editor-in-chief of PC Magazine.
No one believes the release of Windows XP 
will lure crowds outside software retail stores, 
or spark the kind of boost in hardware sales that 
occurred in 1995, with the start of sales of 
Windows 95.
That will not happen, said Bruce Kasrel, an 
analyst with market research firm Forrester 
Research. In 1995, people were lining up 
because they wanted Windows 95. This year, if 
theyre lining up, its for the chance to win a new 
PC or a tifip to Hawaii.
Thats because Windows XP doesnt differ as 
much from its recent predecessors as Windows 
95 did from its forerunner, Windows 3.1.
Still, struggling manufacturers of PCs and 
related equipment, wallowing in their first-ever 
year without sales growth, pray that consumers 
and businesses may have delayed purchases of 
their products until the onset of XP.
As far as businesses go, analysts say large com
panies are unlikely to migrate to the XP 
Professional version (a $199 upgrade) en masse 
because many havent yet switched to the yearold Windows 2000, whose underpinnings are 
essentially the same.
The new version contains more new features 
than operating system half-steps Windows 98 or 
Millennium Edition, including programs for lis/ 
tening to and recording music, playing videos, 
and editing and organizing digital photographs. 
A new feature called Windows Messenger lets
users communicate instantly with others using 
text, voice, and video.
The new demands of a more powerful operat
ing system will mean some hardware upgrades, 
even for some owners of computers less than 
two years old.
Miller warned potential buyers to heed 
Microsofts minimum hardware requirements; 
1.5 gigabytes of hard drive space, 128 
megabytes of RAM, and a 233 MHz processor. 
If you have an older computer, dont bother, he 
said.
Windows XP, the platform on which 
Microsofts Web-based business strategy hinges* 
also ushers users toward Microsofts online ser
vices. After logging on, the software repeatedly 
beseeches users to sign up for Microsofts identic 
ty authentication program, Passport. For now, 
Passport-enabled programs including email; 
travel, and instant messaging tools are free; 
Later, as new services are added, Microsoft 
plans to charge subscription fees.
On Wednesday, a Microsoft-sponsored event 
in New York showed off dozens of products that 
vendors said were crafted with XP in mind, from 
software to CD burners to a new Intel Pentium 4 
microprocessor.
On the multimedia side, a mini-CD burner by 
Imation called RipGo! allowed users to store six 
hours of audio files in a new high compression 
Windows format on a single CD.
Verizon previewed its Digital Companion add
on for Windows Messenger, giving users the 
capability to listen to their home voice mail and 
check IDs from calls to their home phone from 
any Internet-connected PC running XP.

Goodkinds Faith of the 
Fallen brings no surprise
by Jonathan Pearce
Comics Editor
(Mild spoilers here, but worry 
not. The book isnt worth read
ing.)
Argh. Terry Goodkind must die. 
This is my mantra; this is what I 
believe.
Dont get me wrong. This is not 
a truly God-awful book like Tom 
Clancys Net Force, poorly written 
and exhaustingly dull. It is merely 
an unbelievably frustrating one. 
Goodkind has the curious faculty 
of creating characters one can 
really care about and then making 
them do the least interesting 
things possible. I didnt care for 
the original Sword of Truth book 
and I was sorry to have read the 
second. I swore off the series then 
and there, >ut I unfortunately did 
not hold myself to that and chose 
to read Faith of the Fallen.
Lets start with Goodkinds 
heavy-handed foreshadowing. 
Nothing, I repeat nothing, ever hap
pens in a surprising fashion in the 
Sword of Truth series. There is no 
event, no surprise that the reader 
cannot see coming a mile away 
because of Goodkinds obvious 
clues strewn throughout the text. 
He seeks, I suppose, to write no plot 
twists without justification. A supe
rior author such as Douglas Adams 
could tie together all the little 
threads of the story at the end, leav
ing nothing unjustified or without 
cause. Goodkind seeks to do that 
too, but he chooses to employ mas
sive iron chains that the reader can 
feel shifting and straining through
out the text instead of little threads. 
What he achieves, then, is a sense of 
inevitability and a plot devoid of 
tension. Reading Faith of the Fallen 
was like standing frozen, watching 
the headlights draw near. The read
er is just waiting for impact. And, 
with any luck, unconsciousness.
Goodkind, at least with this and 
the first two Sword of Truth books, 
is formulaic. Once again, Richard 
and Kahlan are separated when 
Richard is taken prisoner. Once 
again, Richards magic personality 
serves to see him through this lat
est ordeal. Once again, Kahlan 
and Richard are completely and 
mind-numbingly in love with each 
other. Once again, the main 
antagonists of the book shift. 
Goodkind cant even stick to a 
good-old-fashioned Keeper 
(cough, Dark One, cough) takingover-the-world plot, a la Wheel of 
Time, for more than a novel and a 
half before losing interest and 
generating new enemies. 
Enemies, I might add, which a fol
lower of the series cares nothing 
about, for theyve appeared liter
ally from nowhere.
While Im harping on the sub
ject, the Sword of Truth universe is 
frighteningly derivative. Cmon, 
people. Sisters of the Light? 
Touching your Han? Dont even 
get me started on some of the 
names. More important than 
these superficialities, however, 
are the complete and utter lack of 
things Goodkind addresses which 
Robert Jordan has not already 
covered, and better, a half-dozen 
books ago. The only dimension 
Goodkinds work has over 
Jordans is this mindless love-fest 
between Richard and Kahlan, 
which weve already determined 
is more of a lack of dimension 
than anything else.
Goodkind has the oddest 
vendetta against faith. The 
biggest, and for the most part 
only, propounders of faith in 
Faith of the Fallen are the Sisters 
of the Light in particular and the 
vast majority of the Old World in 
general. These characters faith 
in the Creator serves only to 
cloud their good reason and

Toned-down Emmys go 
on after much delay
by Kristin Lala
Copy Co-Manager
Ellen DeGeneres hosted the twice-delayed 
Emmy Awards on Sunday in LA, providing an 
entertaining-yet-understated commentary for 
the much-hyped event. Competing with the 
World Series for television viewing time, the 
Emmys were surprisingly devoid of many 
celebrities, as win after win was often followed 
by, They couldnt be here tonight, but... The 
show wasnt a completely lost cause, however.
One highlight of the evening: When introduc
ing the actresses of Sex and the City, for 
instance, Ellen remarked, I tell ya, when those 
four women get together and talk about men...
I have no idea what they're talking about.
Despite these tidbits of humor, the awards con
cluded with a little more somberness than usual, as Barbra Streisand, 
winner of Best Performance in a Variety or Music Program, sang Youll 
Never Walk Alone, a tribute to the victims of September 11 with their 
names listed on the wall behind her.

Mall at Robinson satisfies reviewer's need to shop
by Sara Stille
Co-Editor-in-Chief
While the Robinson Town Center area has 
long been a popular shopping destination for 
CMU students, the opening of the new Mall at 
Robinson on October 26 should draw even more 
students to get their shopping fix.
While prior to my trip to the Mall at Robinson, 
the Ross Park Mall had always been my favorite 
shopping center in the area, the large variety of 
stores and fairly classy architecture of the build
ing quickly changed my mind. I had heard so 
much promotion and seen way too many preten
tious signs advertising the opening of the new 
mall that I greatly feared that it was built up too 
much and would inevitably be a disappoint
ment.
I was pleasantly surprised, however. We went

Reviewer defines Mulholland Drive as a 
dream, both figuratively and literally
by Sam Lewis
Junior Staffwriter
The mind is the mole.
Dreams have cluttered my mind recently with 
images of people and places of which I make little 
sense. All seem bizarre and saying so seems without 
reason. I try to find a thread that in some way can 
draw the images into some cohesive pattern. I want 
to explain a lot more than can be expected. Fred 
Ward appears in a Gabriel Brothers discount store 
and I want it to mean more than just a recapitula
tion of a film that I have seen that day. So as to stop 
disappointing myself, I need to avoid the analysis 
and simply attempt to follow the path on which it 
takes me.
Courtesy of Universal Studios
Mulholland Drive is a dream, perhaps figuratively 
and, within the story, most definitely literally. If one 
is to watch Mulholland Drive and then be left in the 
theater feeling confused and ultimately unfulfilled, 
then it is better to not even try to sit through a view
ing of the picture. Some have said that the slowly 
broadening plot builds to climax until the point when 
images are rearranged and then engulf the viewer. 
Perhaps that would seem typical in a David Lynch 
film. Yet this one differs in that Lynch seems to avoid 
resorting to create a mishmash of surreal images that 
only confuses the audience.
Lynchs eclectic collection of works is most 
renowned for the images of an unreal reality. It is a 
world which exists behind the illusion of sunshine 
and normalcy; it is provocative and sometimes dis
turbing. In Mulholland Drive, Lynch takes 
Hollywood and develops for it the same atmos
phere that he shaped for the small American town 
in Twin Peaks.
This is the same Hollywood that initially rejected 
the film and its intense imagery. Mulholland Drive 
was originally intended to be a pilot for a proposed 
Lynch television series back in 1999, but there was 
conflict between the director and the producers over 
its length and content. The project was salvaged by 
Studio Canal in France and the resulting film was 
completed with additional footage. One can automat
ically see the effect upon the film. Characters appear 
for several scenes and then are never encountered 
again. The last half hour of the movie may appear 
heavy-handed, but it is nevertheless more tightly con
structed than it first appeared. Lynch is unconven
tional and he challenges Hollywood. He is eccentric. 
And this film proves him to be amongst the best of

Character (Karakter) 
Thursday, November 8
Its often said that theatrical adaptations of books are subpar, and that they dont relate the message in the book. 
According to reviewers, Character defies all preconceptions of 
turning a book into a movie. This foreign movie has a fantas
tic script, that captures all of the philsophical depth and psy
chological understanding that the book it is based on con
tains. Character is full of characters as well. That is what the 
movie is about. The different characters in the film are twist
ed and changed, each with their own depth and development. 
Any writing student studying character development should 
see this movie.
If you could develop your own character, who, or what, 
would it be? I think Id create a beast the size of Hunt Library. 
Like our library, it would be made of aluminum and glass, and 
would walk around like a 90 year old man with arthritis. His 
name would be Max. Max the Beast. His pleasant demeanor 
would charm students, as he would sit on the Cut, and tell sto
ries of how things were back in the day. The ultimate frisbee 
players would be forced to exclude him from their games, 
though. Max tends to not watch where he is stepping, and 
might take out a half-dozen frizbee players at a time.

Legally Blonde 
Friday, November 9
If you are a fashion design major aspiring to go to law 
school, then this movie is definitely worth your time. The gor
geous Reese Witherspoon plays a stereotypical blonde sorority 
queen, who just happens to be dumped in her boyfriends pur
suit for a more serious girl. Elle (Witherspoon) deems it nec
essary to go to law school to become more serious in order to 
get Warner (Matthew Davis) back. But she discovers her own 
legal savvy along the way, and her life is changed.
Warner was stupid to dump such a great girl. Not only is she 
beautiful, bubbly, and personable, but shes also really smart! 
Its not often that those great qualities come together in one 
person. She had a good heart as well, as shown by her charity, 
and the way she was able to relate to all people. The beauty 
shop worker was obviously of a different class, but that didnt 
matter. Elle befriended her, and they became instant chums.
I argue that Elles charm and love for people is the key to her 
success. That, my friends, is the moral of the story.

Planet of the Apes 
Saturday, November 10
The king of weird, Tim Burton, puts another weird movie 
onto the screen. The director of Beetlejuice and James and the 
Giant Peach reimagines the 1968 movie of the same name. 
Mark Wahlberg is the hero, who crash lands on a far away 
planet, inhabited by super-evolved apes. These damn, dirty 
creatures rule the planet with an iron fist, and view any 
intruders as enemies. Wahlberg encounters the beautiful 
Estella Warren on an island. She pleads for their escape, but 
Wahlberg falls in love with an ape, played by Helena Bonham 
Carter. Come to McConomy on Saturday to see how true, or 
untrue, to the original this is.
This movie would have been much more interesting if the 
apes werent apes at all, but polar bears. That reminds me of 
those old Coca-Cola commercials around Christmas time. The 
polar bears always had a smile on their face, as they popped 
open a can of Coke and saw Santa Clauss train go by. I think 
the polar bears would have a much nicer demeanor than the 
apes would. There wouldnt be any executions, the worst that 
would happen would be a captive getting Coke poured over 
his head. Except it would be really cold. However, I think that 
the polar bears would build elaborate igloo prisons to hold 
their captives in. They seem much more accomodating than 
the apes.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 5, 2001
Beavis and Buttheads favorite band, Gwar, introduces new album
GWAR, from page B6
me at times of Overkill musically, and per
haps even some death-ish grunts thrown in 
for good measure. Thats not to say that there 
arent funny and irreverent lyrics to be 
found....
Huh huh, hey Butthead. Who is this guy 
talking about?
Hes talking about Gwar, bunghole. Hes 
saying that they still rock and stuff.
Yeah! Gwar kicks ass! Like when they sing 
Im so sick, sick of you, the things you say, 
and the things you do. And then they spray 
all the dudes in the audience with the stuff 
from his thingie. Yeah, thats cool!
Yeah, but that was like in the 60s or 
something. This guys saying that they sound 
like Slayer or something now.
Well, not entirely, but I like the fact that 
they arent afraid of practicing the black art 
of heavy metal, at least music-wise. Their 
words are still funny (if like me you have an 
immature sense of humor at times....)
A random sampling of the lyrics dug up
this gem:
Beefcake the mighty, his ass was wide/ 
Brought 80 laden oxen, he was a good all/ 
Jizmak the Gusha, his legion was described/ 
For many hours he barked at the tribe/ But 
then the catering arrived/ Booze, drugs, food 
400 mule leads high/ Flattus Maximus this 
he did supply/ And now the mighty brothers 
of Gwar did bind
Well, it may not seem out of place in a 
Manowar album, but hey, I think it works, 
no? Seriously, that was about the only verse 
I could print here. Lets face it, these are the 
Backstreet Boys of horror 
punk/metal/satire. Fans flock to their 
shows to gaze at the mighty Balsac, the 
Jaws of Death, Jizmak the Gusha, Oderus 
Ungerus, Beefcake the Mighty, and yes, 
even Flattus Maximus. They line up to enter 
the slave pit, to be knighted by Oderus and 
his, uhhhhh.... Anyway, for any fan it is an 
honor to leave a show with their Gwar tshirt soaked in blood from the stage. Why 
would you even think of not owning this 
album, then? Are you so silly as to believe 
that you can resist the mighty warriors from
Antarctica, those who shall conquer this 
puny Earth and enslave it as they see fit? 
No, resistance is for the weak....
Uh, Butthead, why is he talking like that?
 Shut up, hes talking about Gwar again. I 
think....
Yes, fools! I mean, uh huh huh huh....
Monsters Inc. tops box office
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Monsters 
Inc. scared away the weekend com
petition.
The film about a monster factory 
that collects kids screams recorded 
the best debut ever for an animated 
film and the sixth-best opening of 
all time, bringing in $63.5 million, 
according to studio estimates 
Sunday.
Monsters Inc., the latest film from 
the Disney/Pixar partnership that 
produced the Toy Story movies and 
A Bugs Life, far outdistanced those 
earlier hits.
The previous top opening for an 
animated film was the $57.4 mil
lion recorded by 1999s Toy Story 2, 
which also held the previous record 
for best November opening.
Theres something about the 
Pixar/Disney partnership whereby 
the creative forces behind these films 
really know what kids want to see, 
said Paul Dergarabedian, president 
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks 
the box office. Everything that they 
do with these films seems to exactly 
capture what kids are looking for.
Opening in second place over the 
Friday to Sunday weekend was The 
One, Jet Lis latest action film. The 
film brought in $20 million, the 
strongest opening to date for a film 
starring Li. Unlike his earlier Romeo 
Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, the 
film was rated PG-13, not R.
Domestic Disturbance, a thriller 
starring John Travolta, debuted in 
third place, bringing in $14.5 million.
Monsters features the voices of 
John Goodman as the gorilla-like 
Sully and Billy Crystal as his pal Mike 
Wazowski, an eyeball with arms and 
legs. Havoc ensues when Goodmans
character accidentally lets a little girl 
wander through her closet into the 
monster world, where human chil
dren are considered toxic.
The take for Monsters, Inc. easily 
outdistanced the $42.4 million 
DreamWorks animated Shrek 
brought in on its opening weekend 
in May. But Shrek remained strong 
for weeks, and at $267 million is the 
years highest-grossing movie so far.
Two films did very well opening 
in limited release. ,
The whimsical French-language 
romance Amelie, a big hit at Cannes, 
stars Audrey Tautou as a quirky 
woman who sets out to put some 
meaning and love into the lives of 
those around her. It was on only 
three screens  two in New York 
and one in Los Angeles  and took 
in a total of $140,000, an outstand
ing $46,667 per screen average.
Opening on 38 screens, the Coen 
brothers latest film, The Man Who 
Wasnt There, brought in $673,300 
over the weekend for a $17,718 per 
screen average.
Estimated ticket sales for Fridays 
through Sunday at North American 
theaters, according to Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc. Final figures are 
to be released Monday.
1. Monsters Inc., $63.5 million.
2. The One, $20 million.
3. Domestic Disturbance, $14.5
million.
4. K-Pax, $10.7 million.
5. Thirteen Ghosts, $8 million.6. Riding in Cars with Boys, $4.5
million.
7. From Hell, $3.7 million.8. Training Day, $3.2 million.
9. Bandits, $3 million.
10. Serendipity, $2.5 million.
New Mall at Robinson offers variety of 
shops, food, entertainment choices
MALL, from page B6
to the mall on the Saturday night after it opened and 
were greeted by a fairly large but not overwhelming 
crowd, a large food court, stores to fit every taste, and 
musical performances in the center area. The mall 
holds four main department stores: Kaufmanns, 
JCPenney, Sears, and Dicks Sporting Goods.
On top of that, the mall also features such stores as 
Discovery Channel, Victorias Secret, Eddie Bauer, 
Banana Republic, Gap, Gap Kids, Baby Gap, Ann 
Taylor, Yankee Candle, Express, Limited Too, 
Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, 
Pacific Sunwear, The Buckle, Aeropostale, and Rice & 
Co. I also has emailing checking stations for those of 
us with serious addicitons.
The overall look and feel of the mall was very wel
coming and just looked like a step up from the Ross 
Park or Monroeville Mall. But I suppose with a price tag
of $130 million and planning since the 1980s, it should 
be nice. It has a large food court area with seating for 
over 600 people and a variety of food vendors, includ
ing my personal favorite  the classic Orange Julius.
I had very few complaints overall. One was that the 
centerpiece of the mall was a Starbucks coffee and 
the other that there are no restaurants in the mall. 
We wanted to get some decent food at a sit-down 
restaurant, but were forced to finish our shopping 
and exit the mall to find such a restaurant.
I think the new mall is definitely worth trying out. 
They even have a bus route already set up to take you 
directly to the mall, so besides the lengthy distance, 
transportation shouldnt be an issue. Besides, while 
youre there, you can get a bite to eat at one of the 
nearby restaurants and also hit up stores like WalMart and IKEA. So next time you feel the need to 
shop, check out the Mall at Robinson.

Faith of the 
Fallen falls 
short of 
expectations
FAITH, from page B6 
make them obstruct Richard in 
new and inevitable ways. 
Goodkind seems to be advanc
ing opinions about faith com
monly held by rebellious juve
niles seeking direction and pur
pose. Personally, I tired of this 
sort of thing a while ago. I also 
like to entertain the idea that 
most adults understand the 
complexities of faith, and 
Christianity in particular, which 
the Sword of Truth universe 
seems to reject, though that may 
be wishful thinking on my part. 
Incidently, Gordon Dickson 
wrote a wonderful science-fiction treatment of the complexi
ties of faith in Soldier, Ask Not 
which I recommend without 
reservation.
Finally, and here is my biggest 
beef with the book and also my 
biggest spoiler, I couldnt stom
ach the Objectivism at all. I 
swear to God. Had it been a 
good thousand pages thicker, 
Faith of the Fallen has the stuff 
to rival Ayn Rand herself. 
Whats more, Goodkinds pro
tagonist does not demonstrate 
the radical superiority of reason 
against the backdrop of a titanic 
life and death struggle of a 
nation, but rather a pitiful sort 
of microcosm which, honestly, I 
could not care about. Im sup
posed to gain joie de vivre and 
respect for mans rationality 
above all else from Richard lug
ging around charcoal? Perhaps I 
could accept the Objectivism 
better if it werent so painfully 
painted over the plot. Richards 
speechifying on the nature of 
reason is just as terrifying as any 
of John Galts multiple-page 
monologues, but less appropri
ate. While I hesitate to call the 
resolution of the book deus ex 
machina since the reader could 
see it coming five hundred 
pages away, the way things 
neatly tie together at the end, 
dare I say it, defies reason. Yet 
reason is, ultimately, the bizarre 
and inexplicable cause for writ
ing this book, a theme never 
hinted at within the other Sword 
of Truth novels Ive read. Within 
Faith of the Fallen, however, 
Goodkind heaps it on with a 
trowel.
Faith of the Fallen. My opinion? 
Feces. But you dont have to take 
my word for it.
Rob Zombie offers big arena rock album and 
fist pumping anthems with The Sinisters Urge
by Albert Cohen
Staffwriter
So, what awaits the fearless listener as he or 
she pops in the new Rob Zombie into a greedy 
CD player? Will there be another Dragula or 
Superbeast?
Well, no, of course not. This is the man who 
helped us rediscover the horror-rock genre in 
the vein of Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osborne 
(both of whom remain as vital and relevant as 
they were in decades past). Let me start out by 
saying that this is definitely a big, arena rock 
type album with fist pumping anthems. The 
now requisite movie outtakes open up the 
album on Sinners Inc. which bleeds into 
Demon Speeding, a standard Zombie rocker. 
The album then changes direction a bit with 
Dead Girl Superstar. The movie outtakes are 
still there, interlaced with the music, but the 
groove is a bit slower. Kind of hard to explain, 
but its there nevertheless.
Perhaps a better example is Never Gonna 
Stop. The beat is slower, has a lounge feel to it 
and, if it werent for the heavy guitar interludes, 
wouldnt find itself out of place on any com
mercial rock radio station. But, then among all 
of this newfound groove we find the albums 
first standout, Iron Head. A duet with Ozzy, 
his tour mate this winter, we find Mr. Zombie 
utilizing all that is heavy in what turns out to be 
a perfect one-on-one match up between two 
heavyweights.
However, as quickly as he digs into solid gold 
metal, Zombie goes back to a laid-back, 
reserved groove (I can never call this guy mel
low) with (Go to) California. For better or 
worse, this is an album that takes fans into new 
territory. Its not that we arent used to disco 
beats (remember that old band with More 
Human than a Human?). Or thirty-piece 
orchestras. In fact, the orchestra works. On 
Bring Her Down, he does what Metallica 
failed to do in their collaborations with classi
cal orchestras, which is incorporate them into 
the song. The albums penultimate track, 
Scum of the Earth has been previously 
released, but it is the closer that warrants some 
attention.
House of 1000 Corpses is interesting for 
two reasons. First off, it is the title of the movie 
that Zombie filmed for Universal Studios. The 
movie was deemed too dark and disturbing for 
release under their corporate releasing guide
lines (actually, I heard that some members of 
test audiences threw up during previews, but 
thats just a rumor) and has yet to see the light 
of day. Secondly, the song is really, really cool. 
I like the introduction with news clips (presum
ably from the movie) that sets up the sing-along chorus. The random voices (the squeaky
girl telling us shes going to get us, for example) 
lend to the spooky vibe, and finally, listeners 
start to see how the laid-back style of Zombies 
new album is actually glued together from 
beginning to end. All in all, I recommend lis
tening to the album from beginning to end 
(especially waiting for the hidden part at the 
end of House of 1000 Corpses).
The Sinister Urge is worth checking out even 
if you werent a fan before. Check out the guest 
appearances by Tommy Lee (Motley Crue) and 
Kerry King (Slayer).
Mulholland Drive  dreamlike 
film, not easily categorized
DRIVE, from page B6 
American directors. At last, he has 
taken his own unique style and cre
ated a story which actually allows a 
meaningful interpretation.
The movie opens with a dark lim
ousine traveling along a secluded 
road in the hills of Hollywood. In 
the back seat of the car sits a beau
tiful, dark-haired woman. There is 
an unexpected stop and the driver 
pulls a gun on her. Before she can 
react, a drag-racing car approach
ing from the other direction strikes 
the limo. The female stumbles from 
the accident and down a hillside 
into the valley. She somehow finds 
her way into the apartment of 
Betty, a young Hollywood hopeful. 
The aspiring actress is staying at 
her absent aunt Ruths residence 
i while she awaits an audition. Betty 
finds the other woman in her show
er; she apparently has amnesia and 
cannot remember anything, even 
her name. She takes the name Rita 
from a Gilda poster hanging in the 
bedroom. From there, the two 
embark on a journey in search of 
Ritas true identity and of what 
exactly happened on Mulholland 
Drive.
Throughout the course of the 
story, we meet a young director 
down on his luck, an enigmatic 
cowboy who appears everywhere, 
and a decaying corpse, among 
other things. Their interactions 
weave a tale of lost innocence and 
regret. Shifts in time disorient the 
| viewer, but the course of action is 
nonlinear. One begins to question 
whether Betty and Rita are not 
the same person, and then the 
viewer is forced to question 
! whether anything he has just seen 
actually took place. Mulholland 
Drive becomes very much a dream 
itself. Giving a cryptic explana
tion of this film, Lynch was quotCourtesy of Universal Studios
ed saying, Intuition is such a 
beautiful thing. Its a knowing
ness inside. And to me its part of 
the language of cinema.
If you want to appreciate this 
film, you must learn to feel the 
film. It, like a dream, does not nec
essarily demand an explanation. It 
communicates images and sensa
tions. And unlike the majority of 
Hollywood cinema, it incites us to 
feel and interpret, instead of watch 
and listen.
When I left the theater after 
watching Mulholland Drive, I felt 
like I had entered an unreality. 
Streets were emptied and obese 
men emerged from the shadows, 
watching my every move. The 
movie affected me as my dreams 
do. Sensations replaced vacant 
praise for a film that merely enter
tains. The mind became the mole 
because there is no reason for it not 
to have done so.
FINAL GRADE: A

Total surveillance of the world's population was inevitable, but 
it happened sooner than most people expected.
As a result, crime was at an all time low. Curiously, however, so was creativity.
This was viewed as a "necessary setback until the stifling of innovation caused the economy to grind to a halt.
Frantically, the government conducted a survey to find the root of the slowdown. The answer was all too obvious: people felt less like taking 
risks when their every move was being watched, less like communicating their ideas when their every word was analyzed.
In a highly classified operation the CIA formed a fake protest group which appeared to stage a revolt and destroy the surveillance infrastructure, while actually replacing it surreptitiously with an even more invasive system.IT'S INCREDIBLE METAPHOR
