Tartans speed to a 
$2 million victoryGeneral John Abizaid speaks on our 
future in the Middle Eastcomplying with California state 
traffic laws.
The Urban Challenge is a 
very bold challenge. It might 
defy victory in the first or second 
competition, Whittaker told The 
Tartan in 2006, when the uni
versity announced that it would 
compete. But the only way to 
know that is to pursue it.
And pursue it they did. In yes
terdays race, while Stanford 
Universitys Junior was the first 
to cross the finish line at 1:45 
p.m., teams were reminded that 
the first vehicle to cross the fin
ish line may not be the winner, 
as points are deducted for traffic 
violations, and time subtracted 
for several halts by DARPA for 
safety and other unexplained 
issues. Boss began twenty to 
forty minutes after Junior but 
made up significant time over the

Abizaid also outlined four 
broad issues that will keep 
Americans in the Middle East 
for a long time: the rise of Sunni 
extremism, exemplified by such 
groups as al-Qaida; growing 
Shiite extremism, epitomized 
by the Iranian government; the 
Arab-Israeli conflict; and the 
world economys dependency on 
Middle East oil.
Im not saying this is a war 
for oil, but I am saying that oil... 
fuels an awful lot of the geopolit
ical moves that politicalpowers 
may have there, he said. And 
it is absolutely essential that we 
in the United States of America 
figure out how, in the long run, 
to lessen our dependency on for
eign energy.
said Iraq was merely a segment 
of the Middle East conflict.
Its going to be hard; its go
ing to be long; its going to be 
arduous, dangerous, bloody, 
and expensive, he said. But, on 
the other hand, I do believe its 
workable, provided that we have 
conversations like this and un
derstand the dynamics that are 
at play out there.
In Wednesdays speech, Abi
zaid stressed the importance 
of confronting the ideological 
challenges in the Middle East, 
especially al-Qaida, which has 
moved the battle to the interna
tional communication zone of 
the Internet, marking a historic 
shift in warfare. When asked 
what has prevented al-Qaida from 
attacking the U.S. after Sept. 11, 
Abizaid responded, luck.

At 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon, 
Carnegie Mellons autonomous 
Chevy Tahoe Boss won first 
place  and $2 million  in 
the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) Urban 
Challenge. Boss is the product 
of innovations by the 49 mem
bers of Tartan Racing, led by ro
botics professor William Red 
Whittaker.
The Challenge is a high-stakes 
competition in which teams 
build a driverless car capable of 
traveling a 60-mile suburban 
mock-up course in which they 
complete tasks such as parking, 
U-turning, traversing a traffic 
circle, and assessing obstacles 
such as traffic signs, intersec

Committee holds open house for 
Carnival weekend Mobot races
On Wednesday, Carnegie Mellons 
Mobot Committee will host a fall 
open house in preparation for the 
14th-annual Mobot races, to take 
place during Carnival weekend 2008. 
Students, faculty, staff, and alumni 
from all departments are invited to 
form teams to design and construct a 
Mobot (derived from mobile robot) 
for the competition.
During the competition, the Mobots 
will follow a white line along a specific 
path on an outdoor course, which pres
ents various technical difficulties for 
teams in terms of enabling the robot 
to navigate outdoors and on uneven 
terrain. Participants gain hands-on 
research experience in the course of de
termining the perception, action, and
reasoning capabilities of the robot.
The first-place team will receive 
$1000. In addition to second and third 
places, for which participants receive 
$500 and $250, respectively, there are 
also monetary awards for Open Class 
($250), Judges Choice ($100), and 
Course Record ($250). In addition, all 
the winners names will be inscribed 
on a plaque permanently displayed in 
the Engineering & Science Library in 
Wean Hall.
The open house will start at 6:30 
p.m. in Wean Hall 5409. Pizza will 
be served. Former participants will be 
present to answer questions.

THE TARTAN  NOVEMBER 5, 2007
Staying Ahead in the Business Race
Dozier speaks at Carlow
DOZIER, from AlScottish terrier to make its debut as mascot Nov. 10
The Task Force drafted a mascot 
proposal and sent requests to de
sign and branding firms so that 
one could be selected to help de
sign the mascot.
This fall, members of the task 
force formed a mascot steer
ing committee to work with k 
SME Branding, the designer and branding firm 
selected by the university, 
to go through the phases of es-. 
tablishing the official mascot and 
mascot graphic. The designers 
from SME Branding have devel
oped the concepts and, with the 
help of focus groups consisting 
of students, faculty, staff, and 
alumni, have established th di
rection and detail for the design 
of the Scottie dog.
I think that finally having an 
official mascot is going to make 
a huge impact on campus, said 
Julia Kramkova, a sophomore 
business administration major. 
Kramkova was in one of the 
focus groups that viewed the 
mascot design.
CMU is finally going to have 
an image that isnt a piece of 
plaid cloth. Its true, the Scot
tie dog isnt all that intimidat
ing, but at least we now have an 
animate object to represent our 
student body, Kramkova said. 
The Scottie dog has been a part 
of CMU since the times of Carn
egie Tech and it is great to know 
that we are now officially em
bracing him. I saw the original
Scottie dog T-shirts and an ex
panded selection of merchandise 
featuring the new mascot by late 
November.
The university hopes that an 
official mascot will enhance the 
student experience and create 
a greater sense of community 
across campus and with our 
alumni, said Sophie Nassif, Car
negie Mellons director of Brand 
Initiatives.
Up until this year, the wellknown Scottie dog associated 
with Carnegie Mellon has been 
an unofficial mascot. While 
there have been variations of the 
Scottie dog, none were officially 
trademarked. While some clip
art icons were grandfathered in 
1998-99 for use in locations such 
as the bookstore, student organi
zations are not allowed to use the 
graphic on university apparel.
After repeated complaints 
from students, the university re
alized that a clip-art design was 
not enough and that Carnegie 
Mellon needed an official mas
cot. Last year, the Mascot Task 
Force was formed to solicit in
put from students, faculty, staff, 
and alumni in order to develop 
a proposal for an official mascot 
and mascot graphic for Carnegie 
Mellon. Based on the feedback 
the task force received, the 
v message was clear  CarnV egie Mellon wanted the 
\ Scottie Dog as its
\ official mascot.
spite the danger of the situation 
and several close encounters, 
Dozier continued to cover the 
stories.
On Memorial Day 2006, Doz
ier and her team were heading 
to an area about to be handed 
over to Iraqi control. However, 
they stopped to visit a site where 
a car bomb had gone off the day 
before. When Dozier and the oth
ers with her neared the car and 
were within 30 feet of it, the car 
bomb was remotely detonated, 
killing cameraman Paul Douglas 
and soundman James Brolan in
stantly, as well as others on site. 
Dozier was severely injured.
Despite the setback, Dozier was 
enthusiastic about the change 
in the medias perception of the 
Middle East. While she has been 
criticized for showing the other 
sides views and opinions of the 
U.S. presence in Iraq, she told the 
audience she continues to support 
her reporting methods.
We know what we think. Its 
my job to show what they think, 
she said.
Dozier closed her lecture with 
her thoughts about how to im
prove the Middle East crisis.
Within the military, theres a 
growing sense of religion and cul
ture, she said. You must respect 
the culture or you cant help them. 
You have to ask where they want 
help. When we try to put ourselves 
in their shoes, well be on the road 
to figuring out how to fix things.

Wellesley College, where she 
was involved with political activ
ism. She graduated in 1987 with 
a bachelors degree in human 
rights, hoping to work overseas.
I realized these [activists] 
were risking their lives trying to 
get The New York Times to pub
lish [their message], she said. I 
wanted to be on the deciding end 
to help get the message out.
Dozier attended the University 
of Virginia to obtain a masters 
degree in foreign affairs. At first, 
she was unsure of whether to 
become a diplomat or a journal
ist; however, the first Gulf War 
helped make up her mind.
Here I was reading about it 
while [the journalists] were over 
there seeing it, she said.
After receiving her masters 
degree in 1993, Dozier won an 
alumni grant from Wellesley and 
went to Cairo, where she free
lanced for CBS Radio and The 
Washington Post. In 1996, she 
moved to London to work with 
the BBC World Service before she 
decided to break into television.
I was killing myself covering 
these stories, but when youre in 
radio, youre there by yourself, 
she said. In television, she said, 
there is a collaborative team.
In 2003, she was assigned to 
cover the war in Baghdad, her 
first network assignment for CBS. 
According to Dozier, nobody 
wanted to go to Baghdad; but, de
Over the last two weeks, stu
dents have been wearing shirts 
featuring a silhouetted Scottish 
terrier with the tagline See what 
all the barkings about! Others 
have been walking the campus 
with invisible dog leashes. These 
stunts are part of the universitys 
promotion of Carnegie Mellons 
official mascot graphic, which 
will be unveiled Saturday during 
the last home football game of 
the season.
This weekends launch of the 
primary mascot design is the first 
step in introducing the mascots 
graphic identity.
Additional graphics, including 
secondary and youth marks, are 
forthcoming. Once a Scottie dog 
costume is complete, the mascot 
will be part of student and com
munity activities and will have 
an interactive online presence.

design for Scottie and I must 
say I was pleasantly surprised. I 
think a lot of people will really 
like the new Scottie  hes quite 
the bad-ass!
The first documentation of 
the Scottie dog image for Car
negie Tech was during the mid1930s, according to JayMarano, 
licensing coordinator for Carn
egie Mellon.
Here we are, 70 years later, 
with an official graphic. We 
now have a mascot icon that 
people will be proud of wearing. 
Now [the mascot] is something 
unique and distinctive to Carn
egie Mellon. When people see it, 
they will say Oh, its Carnegie 
Mellon, Marano said. I think 
the student body will be proud 
of the design that will be un
veiled on Nov. 10. This will give 
us something to bark about.
National change needed, Abizaid says
ABIZAID, from AlVendor wanders campus lacking license
ner Center and Baker Hall, police charged the man 
with defiant trespassing and released him.
Police did not reveal the actors name.
The biggest issue was that the man did not have 
a vendors license for selling within university 
boundaries, said Lieutenant John Race.
If the man had obtained a license, there would 
have been no charges, Race said.
However, that a man not affiliated with the 
Carnegie Mellon could walk into two university 
buildings without being stopped worried some stu
dents.
I dont really like that such a possibility exists, 
said Lauren Taglieri, a sophomore information sys
tems major. Id like to think that in some way, our 
campus could be a little bit safer.
However, University Police insisted that the se
curity issue is under control.
No one was harmed in the incident. Yes, there 
was no permit and the man was wandering through 
buildings. However, this was reported; this really 
was a non-incident, Race said.
But the incident made some students uneasy 
about campus security procedures.
Even though he didnt harm anyone, I still dont 
like that he was allowed to go around campus and 
into our buildings, said Lydia Remington, a sopho
more public policy and management major. If he 
could go into the buildings, there could be nothing 
then to stop harmful people from doing the same.
However, according to the 2007 Annual Campus 
Security Report, Carnegie Mellons crime rating of 
33.4 for 2006, placed it among the nations safest 
urban universities.
The FBI rating is a value measuring the frequency 
of violent criminal offenses per 100,000 people.
To put this number into context, Hyde Park, 
home to the University of Chicago, had a crime 
rate of 693 in 2006; schools situated in more rural 
areas, such as Alabama State University and Texas 
Southern University had rates of 1.9 and 11.83 last 
year, respectively.
will have to maintain a presence in the region.
We cant turn our back on the world. Its too 
small, he said.
Abizaid pointed to the Combined Joint Task Force 
for Africa, the U.S. military operation assigned to 
combat terrorism in the Horn of Africa, as an exam
ple of the type of structure necessary in the Middle 
East. Rather than having an active military role, the 
task force functions to help the people help them
selves, and has been largely successful in helping 
local governments stabilize, Abizaid said.
Abizaid retired in March after a four-year stint as 
head of the U.S. Central Command, a tenure that 
makes him its longest-serving leader.
An Arab-American fluent in Arabic and an expert 
in Middle Eastern affairs, Abizaid studied at West 
Point, Harvard, and the University of Jordan in Am
man. Having retired from the Army altogether in 
May, Abizaid now owns an international security 
consulting firm and is a visiting fellow at the Hoover 
Institution at Stanford University.
Senior Eileen Morrison wasnt impressed with his 
lecture.
Im a little bit disappointed, said Morrison, 
who is double majoring in business administration 
and international relations. He has wealth of ex
perience, and I just felt that he didnt give me any 
information I didnt know.
Morrison also felt Abizaids perspective on future 
action was too general. Someone has to start hav
ing ideas, she said. People just keep saying I dont 
know. There has to be a plan. You cant just keep go
ing forward without a plan.
In stressing the long-term nature of the regions 
conflict, Abizaid said Americans must demand that 
debate happen in a way that moves beyond a twofold 
solution of staying in or leaving Iraq.
Im a soldiernot a Republican, not a Democrat. 
Im the poor son-of-a-gun that got saddled with this 
problem militarily, Abizaid said. It is a problem we 
need to have our presidential candidates talk about 
squarely so we can figure out the way ahead.
To move forward, Abizaid said, America cannot 
rely on military power alone. Instead, he said, the 
U.S. government must collaborate more effectively 
to bring diplomacy, economic power, and political 
activity into the equation.
I would characterize what were doing now as 
80 percent military, 20 percent diplomatic, eco
nomic, political, educational, informational, intel
ligence etc., Abizaid said. Youve got to take that 
equation and change it. Make it 80 percent those 
other things.
During the question-and-answer portion of his 
lecture, Abizaid encouraged students in the crowd 
to serve the country and suggested they prepare 
for diplomatic jobs by learning about the culture, 
language, and politics of the Middle East. He also 
pointed to ways for helping in humanitarian ef
forts.
He lauded Carnegie Mellons Qatar campus for 
bridging cultures and making a huge contribution 
to the long-term peace and stability of the region, 
and told The Tartan he was impressed by the depth 
of students interest in the region.
Alex Rutgers, the ROTC battalion commander at 
Carnegie Mellon, found Abizaids speech interest
ing from a military point of view.
I was inspired to emulate his appreciation from 
a soldiers standpoint for political and diplomatic 
victories in tandem with military gains, he said. 
Rutgers, a senior in physics and international rela
tions, also resonated with Abizaids call to under
stand the Middle East through language and cul
ture.
In an interview following the speech, Abizaid 
told The Tartan the American government needs to 
look at the national institutions to more effectively 
issue economic aid to nations in difficulty, such 
as Iraq and Afghanistan.
Abizaid estimated that stabilizing Iraq and Af
ghanistan will take another three to five years. Even 
after their governments gain a firmer hold, the U.S.

The English department had an unexpected 
visitor last Monday morning. At 10:30 a.m., a man 
entered the English office, Baker Hall 260, carry
ing a box of framed paintings. He carried the box 
throughout the office, offering to sell staff members 
the painting of their choice.
The man was a picture salesman lacking a license, 
and selling Van Gogh prints with new frames.
He greeted us with hey ladies, and proceeded 
to walk into our office and open his box of photos, 
said Kelly Delaney, a masters student and graduate 
coordinator for the English department.
The actor was wearing denim jeans, a T-shirt, 
and a baseball cap, Delaney said.
He looked just like a Carnegie Mellon student, 
she said.
While Delaney went to class, undergraduate coor
dinator Eyona Bivins showed interest in the prints.
He seemed to be out of breath, said Bivins, and 
he kept talking about the framing.
When Bivins told the man she did not want the 
prints, he left her office and went into another.
He greeted me by name and claimed to know 
me, said Margaret Kinsky, the department busi
ness manager, but I think he just looked at my 
nameplate outside my office. -
David Kaufer, head and professor in the English 
department, bought some of the prints.
I did not think for a moment that they were real, 
said Kaufer. I just liked the prints and the frames. 
I thought they would be nice to buy for one of my 
family members.
Upon selling the prints to Kaufer, the man left the 
English office and went to the Posner Center, home 
to the Tepper School of Business. There, a female 
staff member found the man suspicious and phoned 
University Police, who apprehended the man.

Midnight crisis at the Fence resolved
FENCE, from A1
ordering FMS personnel to paint 
the Fence white.
Paul Fowler, associate dean of 
student affairs, explained the uni
versitys response.
The dean of Students Office 
called me and said that they had 
received a number of complaints, 
Fowler said. The complaints, he 
said, were from members of the 
campus community that inter
preted the words on the Fence as 
a threat against Mexican immi
grants, warning them to think 
twice before crossing the border.
Theres a difference between 
offensive and threatening, 
Fowler said. As an administra
tion, were not going to regulate 
offensive speech. But this moved 
beyond being offensive to being 
threatening. I understand if [the 
message] was in support of im
migration; if that was the message 
they were trying to relay, Im sorry 
they chose those words.
While Fowler said that it is ex
tremely rare that there would be 
an administrative action to paint 
the Fence, he did justify such ac
tion if it was to remove a message 
perceived as a threat, and that, in 
the 12 years that he has been at
Carnegie Mellon, the administra
tion has not done so before.
There have been times when 
people have painted things on the 
Fence for the sheer obscenity fac
tor, Fowler said.
Fowler maintained that the 
administrations removal of the 
message had nothing to do with 
Family Weekend or the Interna
tional Festival, both of which were 
taking place at the time.
Many Hispanic as well as nonHispanic students were offended 
by the message.
People I talked to were in dis
belief that it was on the fence to 
begin with and found it offensive, 
said Karina Alvarez, a junior sta
tistics major and secretary of the 
Spanish and Latin Student Asso
ciation (SALSA).
Alvarez is of Mexican and Sal
vadorian descent.
Why I got so upset was that I 
didnt know the intentions of that 
message, Alvarez said. Am I sup
posed to be offended, or should I 
be glad that someone is paying at
tention to the immigration laws?
A friend later informed Alvarez 
that the message is a well-known 
quote from a Hispanic protester;
Alvarezs interpretation of 
the message itself was differ
ent from the administrations 
interpretation that prompted im
mediate removal from the Fence.
My interpretation of the Fence 
was that most of the immigrants 
coming over to America are Mexi
can, and the best reason why 
theyre here is because they make 
burritos, she said. Its downplay
ing a lot of achievements of the 
Hispanic community, more spe
cifically, the Mexican community. 
People should be allowed to enter 
America on any basis.
Alvarez spoke to Casalegno, 
who encouraged her to gather a 
group of students, go to the ad
ministration, and ask for paint to 
cover the words they found offen
sive. However, by the time Alvarez 
had done so, she and her group 
went out to the Fence to find that it 
had already been painted over.
Im glad it was taken down as 
quickly as it was, but I believe that 
having students paint over the 
fence would have had a greater 
impact since the Fence is student 
tradition, she said. It should be 
students correcting students, not 
the administration.

Casalegno is The Tartans adviser.

The results of the Urban Chal

predecessor, the DARPA Grand 
Challenge, in 2005. The Grand 
Challenge followed a similar for
mat to the Urban Challenge, but 
on a course in the Mojave Desert. 
However, in the first year, none of 
the entries managed to traverse a 
fraction of the route over the desert 
course (Carnegie Mellons vehicle 
traveled the farthest). In.the 2005 
rematch, Stanford emerged in 
first place, while Carnegie Mel

second and third.
After the qualification event 
last week, only 11 teams of the 35 
that entered qualified for the main 
event on Saturday. Tartan Racing
was the first to pass, while several 
high-caliber teams like Caltech 
and Georgia Tech were stopped 
short for poor performance.
On race day, Carnegie Mellon 
had a poor start. A nearby jumbotron screen scrambled Bosss GPS 
systems, which forced the team 
to replace its receiver on the spot 
and resulted in a late start. The 
rest of the vehicles left the start
ing point at 12 p.m. without major 
incident.
However, almost half of the 
teams were eliminated within two 
hours. Team Oshkoshs gigantic 
military truck, a crowd favorite, 
stopped short of knocking out a 
building pillar, while others col
lided with obstacles and froze 
in confusion in the traffic circle. 
MITs entry touched bumpers

driving shortly after their teams 
entered for a manual reset.
The collision rattled Tartan

team members soon saw images 
of Boss moving along smoothly 
and completing its objectives. At 
this point-, Virginia Techs Victor 
Tango was the first to complete 
every objective and seemed likely 
to nab first place. However, soon 
Stanford and then Carnegie Mel

Overall, six teams  Carnegie

How Things Work: Gene Targeting
Nitrate fills atmosphere
by Marium Chandna
Assistant Sci. & Tech. Editor
Emily Elliott, an assistant 
professor in the department of 
geology and planetary science 
at the University of Pittsburgh, 
led a team of researchers in in
vestigating the link between 
the presence of nitrogen in 
the atmosphere and vehicle 
emissions.
The three-year study was 
published in American Chemical 
Society on Oct. 20.
Nitrogen is not only an essen
tial constituent of key industrial 
compounds such as nitric acid, 
but is also an integral compo
nent of all living tissues and 
proteins.
A nitrate, which is one of the 
many salts found in nitric acid 
that forms as a result of the oxi
dation of nitrogen, is made up 
of one nitrogen and three oxy
gen atoms. Stable isotopes of 
nitrate form when an additional 
neutron is added to nitrate, 
changing its mass number.
Any form of precipitation can 
lead to nitrate deposition in riv
ers and valleys by transporting 
nitrate from its source to other 
locations. This increase in ni
trate deposition causes nitrogen 
levels in the atmosphere to rise.
In the past, tracking fuel 
emission from motor vehicles 
has been an effective method of 
assessing levels of nitrate depo
sition in urban areas.
However, Elliotts study sug
gests that a more profound 
indicator of nitrate levels is 
the presence of stable nitrate 
isotopes across the midwestern and northeastern United 
States.
Stable nitrate isotopes are 
generally emitted from the com
bustion of fossil fuels, coal burn
ing, lightening, and biomass 
burning. These isotopes are also 
present in any concentration of 
nitrate that reaches the earth by 
means of precipitation.
Elliott said, These stable iso
topes cause different reaction

Armed with a heavily re
inforced space suit and some

avoiding contact with the solar

The space walk put Parazynksi farther from the safety of 
the airlock than any previous

returning to safety would have 
required more than 30 minutes

Researchers target 
cancer virus
In a recent study, scientists 
have shown that as many as 1.3 
million cases of cancer a year 
could be successfully treated 
by targeting the preexisting vi
ruses that trigger them.
The research, performed at 
the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine of Teshiva University 
in New York City, could help 
cure many virus-linked cancers, 
including liver cancer, cervical 
cancer, and skin cancer.
The key to preventing cancer 
is to destroy the virus before 
it becomes cancerous. This is 
achieved by radioimmuno
therapy, a method in which 
radioisotopes mounted on an
tibodies are injected into the 
body to seek out and destroy 
viral antigens.

Cat genome is 
sequenced
The genome of the domes
tic cat has been sequenced. 
The subject was a red-furred 
4-year-old Abyssinian named 
Cinnamon. Knowledge of the 
genetic makeup could lead to 
more effective treatment of the 
cats, which occupy the homes of 
nearly 90 million Americans.
Researchers estimated that 
the cat genome would have 
roughly 20,000 genes, based 
on pre-existing human, chimp, 
mouse, rat, and dog analogs.
The genetic makeup of Cin
namon has already helped 
identify the gene responsible 
for blindness caused by retinitis 
pigmentosa. The disease causes 
blindness in kittens, as well as 
one in every 3500 humans.

Smallest radio

Researchers at the University

The nanotube vibrates at 
the exact frequency of incom
ing souifd waves, instead of 
receiving and transmitting 
electromagnetic signals like 
traditional receivers.
The nanotube radio, thou
sands of times smaller than the 
diameter of a human hair, is 
composed of a seamless tube of 
carbon atoms. While research
ers have developed nano-sized 
radio wave detectors before, 
this marks the first time that a 
nano-sized detector has been 
functional in a working radio

were carriers of genes from the 
foreign germ line.
The stage was now set for 
gene targeting.
First, embryonic stem cells 
were harvested from a donor 
mouse. Then, the gene targeted 
for inactivation was to be iden
tified and isolated.
Once the gene was identified, 
scientists constructed a retrovi
ral vector (viralRNA) containing 
the inactive version of the gene. 
The embryonic stem cells were 
then infected with this engi
neered vector.
Here is where homologous re
combination plays a role in gene 
targeting. The stem cells repro
duce naturally, all the while 
propagating the inactivated 
gene from the virus throughout 
the group of stem cells.
The result of this propaga
tion is a healthy population of 
embryonic stem cells, some in
fected with modified genes and 
some that are not.
A method called PositiveNegative Screening is then 
used to separate the two 
groups. The normal cells are 
discarded and the modified 
stem cells are injected into a 
mouse embryo. The engineered 
embryo is then injected into a 
surrogate mother.
About 20 days after the injec
tion, chimeric mice, which 
are mice containing genetic ma
terial from both the engineered 
stem cells and the host embryo 
are born.
Finally, the chimeric mice are 
bred with normal mice to pro
duce a final liter of mice. This 
final liter contains both normal 
mice and designer mice that 
carry and are able to pass down 
the inactivated gene.
Through gene targeting, 
ailments such as cancer, dia
betes, Parkinsons disease, and 
various heart diseases can be 
modeled in knockout mice and 
closely studied by researchers.
fMRI data reveals brain activity in object recognition
Lowell Labaro
Earlier this month, biologists 
Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans, 
and Oliver Smithies split the 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine for their work on gene 
modification in mice.
The technique for which the 
three scientists are credited is 
called gene targeting. It is the 
favored method for creating 
knockout mice.
A knockout mouse is a geneti
cally modified mouse that has 
had one of its genes purposely 
deactivated.
Once a gene is deactivated, 
scientists can make observa
tions and determine the specific 
function of the gene.
As an analogy to gene deacti
vation, imagine walking into a 
room full of power sockets and 
light switches. Each socket is 
connected to a switch, and, ini
tially, you do not know which 
socket corresponds to which 
switch.
To determine which switch 
corresponds to which socket, 
you would have to perform a 
trial-and-error experiment.
This is precisely what these 
three scientists have done, only 
their experiments spanned 
decades and led to groundbreak
ing discoveries in genetics.
To understand gene 
targeting as a whole, one must 
understand the science underly
ing each individuals discovery.
Capecchi studied a natural 
process called homologous re
combination in organisms.
Homologous recombination 
produces an exchange of ge
netic material between two 
strands of DNA, leading to ge
netic variation in a population. 
It was first discovered in 1958 
by Joshua Lederberg.
By 1985, Capecchi 
discovered that homologous re
combination can occur between
genes in mammalian cells and 
artificially introduced DNA. 
He discovered how to demon
strate that injected DNA can be 
used to repair damaged DNA 
through naturally occurring re
combination.
Through this technique, 
Capecchi was able to modify 
genes. However, his modifica
tions could only target genes 
with respect to their particular 
activity.
Smithies, while working 
independently on a genetic 
treatment for blood diseases, 
discovered that genes can be 
targeted regardless of their ac
tivity. That is, Smithies showed 
that all genes can be modified
by homologous recombination.
One should note that the cells 
used in Capecchis and Smithies 
experiments were incapable of 
breeding gene-targeted mam
mals. This breeding would re
quire a cell that is part of the 
germ line.
The germ line of an organ
ism is a line of cells that carries 
genetic material and is able to 
pass it on to offspring.
This is where Evans enters the 
scene. Evans is widely, known 
as the leader of the stem cell 
revolution for recognizing 
the pluripotent characteristic 
of embryonic stem (ES) cells. 
Pluripotent cells can produce 
all types of specialized tissues.
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
According to the Nobel Prize 
website, Evans experimented 
on mice, and he identified and 
isolated the embryonic stem 
cell of the early embryo, the cell 
from which all cells of the adult 
organism are derived.
Evans was able to show that 
stem cells could be used to in
troduce genetic information 
into the germ line. This was 
done by injecting one mouse 
embryo with embryonic stem 
cells from a foreign germ line, 
thus creating, a mosaic em
bryo that carries stem cells 
from both germ lines.
A surrogate mother was then 
impregnated with the mosaic 
embryo. The resulting offspring
According to a study by Mark Wheeler and Elisabeth Ploran, object recognition occurs as a series of neural activations in the brain.
by Akanksha Vaidya
Junior Staffwriter
In an effort to decrypt some of 
the most intriguing secrets of the 
brain, researchers have found 
that visual recognition of objects 
is not a one-step process.
Research performed at the 
University of Pittsburgh sug
gests that visual recognition is 
a stepwise process in which dif
ferent parts of the brain process 
information before an object is 
actually recognized.
Mark Wheeler, psychology 
professor at Pitt, led researchers 
from the Learning Research and 
Development Center in investi
gating the neural behavior that 
underlies object recognition. A 
paper on this research was pub
lished in the Oct. 31 edition of 
the Journal of Neuroscience.
Prior to the experiment, re
searchers knew that if an object 
is slowly revealed to a person, 
the person gathers information 
about the object and retains it in 
his or her brain. After processing 
this information in the brain, the 
person is able to recognize the 
object through a decision-making process.
Wheeler and his team wanted 
to find the neural pathways 
where these decisions are made. 
Similar experiments have been 
carried out on monkeys but not 
on humans.
In Wheelers experiment, par
ticipants were presented with 
grayscale pictures that were 
masked from view by a black 
screen. Initially, the complete 
picture was hidden from view, 
but every two seconds, a small 
portion of the mask was re
moved. This revelation process
took 16 seconds per picture.
Participants were then asked 
to press a button when they felt 
comfortable recognizing the pic
ture. They were asked to press 
the button a second time when 
the complete picture was re
vealed and only if their initial 
decision about the picture had 
been correct.
Using functional magnetic ' 
resonance imaging (fMRI), re
searchers mapped the regions of 
the brain in which activity took 
place during the experiment. 
Brain activity was monitored 
until participants made the final 
decision of recognition.
Elisabeth Ploran, a psychol
ogy graduate student at Pitt who 
worked alongside Wheeler on 
the paper, explained the funda
mental difference between this 
experiment and similar experi
ments performed in the past.
The other studies only look 
at one time point, and thats the 
time point at which they [the par
ticipants of the study] make the 
yes I recognize it decision, she 
said. Our innovative technique 
is to look at the time leading up 
to that decision.
The results of this study re
vealed that three separate brain 
regions are involved in object 
recognition.
The first is the set of sen
sory areas that responds to the 
amount of stimulus. Researchers 
found that activity in these areas 
increased as more of the picture 
was revealed.
Conversely, there was no ac
tivity in these regions when the 
object was completely hidden 
from view.
The next set of areas is the

evidence gathering areas. Ac
tivity in these areas correlated 
with the amount of time that it 
took participants to recognize 
the object.
More specifically, these areas 
process bits and pieces of sen
sory information as more of the 
picture is revealed to partici
pants. Hence, these areas collect 
the evidence and match it up at 
the end to get the solution or the 
complete picture.
Wheeler said, The activity 
in these areas increased rapidly 
when recognition occurred early 
and increased much more slowly 
when recognition occurred later.
The third set of areas is related 
to decision-making processes.
This set of areas includes three 
brain regions: the bilateral thal
amus, part of the supplementary 
motor area, and the dorsal ante
rior cingulate cortex.
Wheelers study revealed some
thing that had not been previ
ously known about these areas
 they are active when the final 
decision is made, but not before 
that.
Wheeler said, What was re
ally surprising was that we could 
clearly disOsociate those signals 
[from the evidence gathering 
areas] from other regions which 
just showed responses when you 
recognized the object. We could 
dissociate the decision-end re
sult signals from the evidence 
gathering signals. For us, that 
was really exciting.
Ploran said, This means that 
theres activity going on in the 
brain thats not necessarily ac
cepted by consciousness until 
you reach some point when you 
know what the object is.
According to a Pitt press re
lease, the findings from this 
study may lead to future work 
that reveals how people make 
good and bad decisions.
Wheeler said, Once we un
derstand what the finer-grain 
mechanisms [of the decision
making pathway] are, it would 
be really nice if we could use the 
information to understand why 
we make poor decisions. It may 
apply to situations where people 
make bad decisions that have 
lifelong consequences, like why 
a person starts taking drugs.
Nitrate threatens cities and nature
NITROGEN, from A5
rates in the biological composi
tion of nitrate. We took weekly 
rainwater samples from different 
regions and observed distribu
tions of isotopes in rainwater to 
test the nitrate concentration in 
spatial and temporal variations.
These samples of rainwater 
showed that most nitrate de
position was located across the 
northeastern United States.
Furthermore, researchers found 
that this nitrate deposition was 
mostly generated by stationary 
sources, including electricity 
generation and the burning of 
coal. However, nitrate deposition 
from stationary sources was gen
erally higher in western states 
than in eastern states.
According to the published 
study, global atmospheric emis
sions of nitrogen oxide have 
increased dramatically during 
the past 150 years. This study 
suggests that the effects of these 
increasing levels of nitrogen are 
drastic and almost irreversible.
High levels of nitrogen in 
populated areas are toxic to hu
man health and almost deadly 
to marine life. Historically, they 
have been responsible for wip
ing out populations of algae and 
small fish, as well as giving rise 
to hypoxia.
Hypoxia is the enrichment of
surface water with high amounts 
of nitrogen, thereby depleting 
the water of oxygen. An extreme 
case of hypoxia is anoxic sea wa
ter, which has dangerously low 
levels of oxygen and is thus a 
significant threat to oceanic eco
systems.
Elliott and her team developed 
a new approach to detecting 
traces of nitrogen oxide in the at
mosphere through extensive lab 
work using a mass spectrometer.
A mass spectrometer is a de
vice that provides researchers 
with a specific measurement of 
isotope composition. It performs 
this measurement in the order of 
ionization, acceleration, deflec
tion, and finally, detection.
Elliott said that this research 
also depended on geographical 
information and statistical data.
We used bacteria to reduce 
the nitrate in rainwater to a gas 
form to test the samples for ni
trate concentration, said Elliott.
Developed by Princeton Uni
versity a few years ago, this 
method of converting nitrate 
into a gas has two major func
tional benefits.
Firstly, it requires very small 
volumes of rainwater for testing. 
Secondly, it acts upon even mini
mal concentrations of nitrates. 
These characteristics are perfect 
for rainwater, Elliott said.
The publication states that
large areas of the landscape 
potentially receive atmospheric 
nitrate deposition inputs in ex
cess of what one would infer 
from existing monitoring data 
alone.
Researchers fear that levels of 
nitrogen in the atmosphere will 
keep increasing as they have in 
the past, eventually leading to 
massive destruction of biological 
life cycles as the nitrogen dis
places oxygen in the air.
This study offers a way to trace 
the fate of nitrogen oxides from 
the stationary sources. It pro
vides a wider scope for locating 
sites with heavy nitrogen con
centration, as well as potential 
treatment.
According to a Univer
sity of Pittsburgh press re
lease, researchers investigated 
precipitation samples from 33 
sites. All of these sites are a part 
of the National Atmospheric De
position Program, an organiza
tion that studies the contamina
tion of precipitation.
Elliott said that most sites 
from this study were located in 
rural areas and were not subject 
to heavy emissions from vehicle 
exhaust.
This condition rules out the 
possibility that such high levels 
of nitrogen in the atmosphere 
arose solely from active sources, 
such as vehicle emissions.

Mayors plan ignores real issues behind crime
A new city ordinance proposed by 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl would allow 
the public safety director great range in 
applying fines, or even second-degree 
misdemeanor charges, to disruptive 
properties. Whether or not a property 
is disruptive would be determined by 
software which counts 911 calls that 
include complaints about drugs, guns, 
drunkenness, excessive noise, build
ing code violations, or even owning too 
many pets. Three calls in a single month 
would result in fines or charges for the 
owner of the property.
These new disruptive property fines 
and charges would presumably have the 
greatest effect on low-income neighbor
hoods where crime is more prevalent. 
It seems Ravenstahl thinks that simply 
issuing fines and charges to homeown
ers in crime-ridden areas will solve drug 
and gun problems in these areas. I 
firmly believe that this legislation today 
is the necessary tool for us to really be 
able to crack down, Ravenstahl said.
Not so, Mr. Ravenstahl. The proposed 
ordinance will treat the symptoms but 
not the disease. To combat crime, Mr. 
Ravenstahl needs to consider the deeper 
reasons that result in the prevalence of 
drugs and drunkenness  the environ
ment that produces and sustains crime. 
The ordinance is an attempt at a quickfix solution that wont solve anything.
Though the intent of the ordinance 
may be good, it is not well thought-out. 
Besides the fact that it wont actually 
solve any of the problems it purports to 
address, the proposal might also inter
fere with residents property rights; the 
proposal has already received the Amer
ican Civil Liberties Unions attention.
Additionally, the ordinance may 
make it more difficult for students to 
find rental houses. Student house par
ties generate a good deal of complaints 
about underage drinking and noise, and 
if landlords are frequently forced to pay 
fines and face misdemeanor charges, 
they may refuse to rent to law-abiding 
students in the future.
University neglects to console victims of Calif, wildfires
More than two weeks after wildfires 
began to spread in San Diego County, 
Carnegie Mellon has yet to take action 
to look after the welfare of students and 
their families from the area. But its not 
just that the administration has failed to 
issue a formal statement acknowledg
ing the fires and their potential to affect 
Carnegie Mellon students; the univer
sity has not taken any practical steps to 
check on students welfare or offer their 
concerns and condolences to students 
and their families.
It is likely that the California wildfires 
have affected a significant portion of 
our student body.
Last academic year, 298 Carnegie 
Mellon undergrads were from Cali
fornia, roughly 5.5 percent of the total 
undergraduate student body. The only 
states from which more students hail are
Pennsylvania (1175), New York (636), 
and New Jersey (596).
The effects of the California wildfires 
have been compared to the devastation 
of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which 
attracted considerably more attention 
from university administration. Official 
Communications issued two separate emails to the entire campus community in 
which the university declared that they 
are also maintaining close contact with 
our 31 undergraduate and graduate stu
dents from Louisiana, Mississippi, and 
Alabama who may have been directly 
impacted by this tragic event and are of
fering our assistance to them and their 
families, and enrolled 15 students from 
Tulane University at Carnegie Mellon 
for the semester.
In contrast, many schools on the West 
Coast issued formal letters to the par
ents of all of its students from southern 
California to express the colleges con
cern for the safety of the families of the 
colleges students. The proximity of the 
issue may have meant that it was on the 
administrations radar at these schools 
more than it was at Carnegie Mellon.
However, proximity should not be a 
factor here. This is a national tragedy, 
and one that the university has not ade
quately addressed. The university cannot 
merely rely on the voluntary kindness of 
housefellows, RAs, professors, and other 
staff and faculty members to reach out 
and offer emotional support to students. 
Carnegie Mellon needs to acknowledge 
the severity of the crisis to the whole 
campus community, make contact with 
all its students from the affected area, 
and offer its support to these students 
and their families.
Rent-A-Dog offends
How much is that doggie in the win
dow? Five dollars, and you dont have 
to feed it, clean up after it, or even keep 
it. Mondays Rent-A-Dog activity on the 
Cut allowed students to rent dogs for 30 
minutes, during which time they could 
play with them and walk them around 
the area.
Though it might have seemed like a 
good idea in theory, renting animals is 
offensive and ultimately pointless. Many 
students were disturbed at the thought 
of giving the dogs, which came from the 
Western Pennsylvania Humane Society, 
the illusion of having owners, when at 
the end of the day they would only be
returning to the kennels. Additionally, 
some felt that Rent-A-Dog devalued 
the dogs, taking them from mans best 
friend to rentable commodities, akin to 
consumer goods like cars, apartments, 
or tuxedos.
Dogs in kennels benefit from social
izing, learning to interact with people 
and act appropriately in public, but this 
could have been accomplished without 
any animals getting rented. The event 
would have been much more successful 
without the $5 price tag and 30-minute 
time period; the Humane Society could 
have just brought their dogs to our cam
pus, encouraging students to play with
them while also offering information 
about volunteer opportunities. Alterna
tively, the Humane Society could have 
advertised around our campus, using 
that means to attract students to come 
visit the dogs.
Aside from the Fluffys and Rovers 
they left at home, most college stu
dents arent interested in owning pets 
of their own. However, many students 
are interested in community service. If 
the Humane Society reached out to our 
campus community, it would surely find 
support in the form of both donations 
and volunteers  no Rent-A-Dog gim
mick required.
Democrats spurn Colbert
BecKman-Hamed
When I saw on Comedy Central (the 
website, not the channel; Im cheap) 
that Stephen Colbert was running for 
president, my first thought was, Whoa! 
Could he pull off a Pirate Captain?
In my junior year of undergrad at 
UNC-Chapel Hill something shocking 
happened  an election for student 
body president that didnt bore me to 
tears. Our rival school, NC State, had 
a candidate running for president as 
the Pirate Captain. Speaking only in 
Pirate and dressed in full pirate regalia 
with blond wig, eye patch, parrot, and 
sword, the Captain (whose real name 
is Whil Piavis) made a campaign video 
in which he and his scurvy crew dug 
up treasure on a beach while explaining 
his platform, or plank, which in
cluded, according to local TV channel 
WRAL, expanding the bus lines to haul 
thar peopled cargo to and fro from ACC 
bouts at the yonder RBC Center and 
holding meetins open to all ye landlub
bers. The effect was immediate. After 
a record voter turnout, the Pirate Cap
tain was elected. The wind be in our 
sails, the student paper, the Technician, 
quoted him as saying after his win.
I was thrilled. Our student elections 
always resulted in dull, ineffective 
leaders who seemed to make little dif
ference on campus and never attempted 
any meaningful change.
Not everybody agreed with me. The 
Captains defeated rival denounced him 
for making a mockery of the system, 
according to the Technician.
Colbert faces similar criticism today. 
The comedian planned to run only in 
his home state, South Carolina, as a 
favorite son (a politician who is popu
lar due to ties to a certain region). For
awhile, things were looking good  de
spite condemnation from all sides. Last 
Monday Bob Coble, mayor of Columbia, 
not only presented Colbert with the key 
to the city and proclaimed him officially 
a favorite son, but even declared the day 
Stephen Colbert Day.
The celebration was short-lived. On 
Thursday, South Carolinas Democratic 
executive committee voted to bar Col
bert from the ballot even though the 
comedian had paid the $2,500 filing fee 
on time. Bad Democrats! Bad!
What the hell is their problem? We 
have to keep the way clear for legiti
mate candidates who change their 
positions to suit the political wind, veer 
unwaveringly toward the middle of the 
road so that nobody gets upset, care 
more about raising money than being 
true to themselves, and see UFOs?
Is it any surprise that the fervor for 
Colbert is much wilder than the fervor 
for any other presidential candidates? 
America is aching for a real candidate, 
not an actor. If the Democrats and Re
publicans wont furnish a real candidate, 
then hell, well go with a real actor.
The Democrats had nothing to lose by 
allowing Colbert on the ballot. Colbert 
himself is not interested in the presi
dency  his bid was designed purely 
to open our eyes to the absurdity of our 
system of elections and perhaps make a 
few more people tune in to the debates. 
When asked in an interview on NPR 
how the road to the presidency would 
play out for him, Colbert replied, It 
doesnt, it ends in South Carolina.
And so, it seems, it has. My hat is off 
to you, Mr. Colbert  youll always be 
the president of my America, and thats 
the truthiness.

Adjusting our extremist attitudes
Steve Weinberg
Are you a vegetarian? A seemingly 
benign question. Do you never eat meat 
or do you eat meat without hesitation? 
We hear this question a lot in our soci
ety, especially when someone at our 
table orders tofu.
The people who are willing to forever 
forgo meat are worthy of our highest 
praise. They are making sacrifices on 
a daily basis in order to curtail the suf
fering of animals and make a personal 
statement about the often abhorrent 
practices used in animal slaughter.
Yet, in turning vegetarianism into 
such a personal issue, our society is 
unknowingly acting against vegetari
anisms main purpose. If vegetarianism 
is to have any effect, it has to work at a 
macro level: decrease overall demand 
for meat by purchasing less of it, and in 
turn, decrease overall supply. Therefore, 
the appropriate question should not be, 
Are you a vegetarian? but rather, How 
much meat do you consume?
Unfortunately, we look at vegetarian
ism as either all or nothing. The people 
who opt for the all route help decrease 
the market demand for meat somewhat. 
But most people decide that its just too 
difficult to never eat meat again, and 
opt for the nothing route. If more 
people choose the middle ground of 
keeping meat consumption to a per
sonal minimum, the demand for meat 
could be decreased more than it would 
by vegetarians alone.
But who can blame non-vegetarians 
for not curtailing their meat consump
tion? Society has always taught them 
that there are only two options: meat
or no meat. There is no middle ground. 
Even in the unlikely event that some
one realizes the positive impact that a 
middle ground can have, there is no 
societal incentive for moderating in
stead of gorging: If you eat meat just 
once a week, you dont get any credit  
youre still just a meat eater. So why not 
gorge?
The fight against global warm
ing is analogous to vegetarianism. By 
comparing the two, we can see the ab
surdity of our current attitude toward 
the latter. Both causes aim for a sort of 
global reduction (one of energy, one of 
suffering), and both require that people 
make personal sacrifices to contribute 
to this global cause. But with recycling, 
one can still be green without literally 
recycling everything one consumes. We 
dont consider people non-recyclers 
because they produce some amount 
of waste that doesnt get recycled. The 
goal here is reduction, not elimination
 and what a difference this attitude 
makes in minimizing waste and com
bating global warming.
Of course, many people have no 
moral qualms at all with eating meat or 
not recycling. But for those of us who 
do care about cruelty to animals but 
feel that all-out vegetarianism is just 
too difficult, let us treat eating meat 
like we do recycling. Though its ideal 
and commendable to recycle and reuse 
everything, people can still make a big 
difference by simply doing the best they 
can within reason. Remember, every 
two people who cut their meat con
sumption in half are essentially helping 
just as much as when one person goes 
cold turkey  pun intended.

Elections reform 
and institutional 
memory
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hi, Tartans. This week has 
been a pretty busy one for us as 
two big initiatives got underway. 
We focused a lot on elections re
form and institutional memory. 
Heres an update:
Elections Reform
Because of what happened 
with the past student body presi
dential elections, we decided 
to form an exploratory reform 
committee that would challenge 
the process as it happens today 
and figure out the best way to do 
things in the future. The commit
tee is equally representative of 
both undergraduate and gradu
ate students so we can bring both 
perspectives to the table. Our 
agenda is composed of four ma
jor action items: election rules/ 
constitutional amendments, 
Elections Board composition 
and tenure, voter eligibility, and 
technical changes. Weve given 
ourselves a fairly hard deadline 
of the beginning of December to 
come out with a concrete written 
set of recommendations for the 
Senate and the Graduate Student 
Assembly to put into practice.
Institutional Memory
Its our view that many of the 
student organizations dont have 
adequate knowledge transition 
processes in place  so when a 
leader leaves, there arent any 
guarantees that his or her suc
cessor will be able to build on 
the change that has already been 
created. Generally, even with 
good communication, bits and 
pieces of knowledge are lost from 
year to year, and are completely 
forgotten at the five-year point 
when the old generation has no 
direct connection with the new.
To tackle this, we hope to build 
a platform into our Org Tracker 
system for documentation and 
softer knowledge to be conveyed 
easily over time. We want to build 
this into Org Tracker to make 
sure that we have a custodian 
(Student Activities) to supervise 
the systems upkeep and suste
nance. This should make student 
organizations on this campus 
stronger and able to do more for 
their members and patrons.
Thursday, we held a meeting 
open to all student organization 
leaders to talk about our vision 
for this and compare it with what 
would actually be useful to those 
leaders. We established two task 
forces, one for the layout/design 
of the tool, and the other to tackle 
viable enforcement issues. Hope
fully well be able to put some
thing together by the spring.
Hopefully your weekend was 
great and Bhangra-ful! As al
ways, let us know if you have 
anything to say at cmu5@cmu. 
edu.

Reforms needed for the student meal plan
Shaleya Solomon
Those of us who are 
upperclassmen without meal 
plans once dreamed of the day 
when DineXtra could be used at 
Entropy. These first-years have 
it so good. Not only can they use 
their DineX at Entropy+, but they 
have a newer convenience store 
in which to do so. The meal plan 
system has kind of improved, but 
there are still things that dont 
make sense about meal plans. 
In amount of food, cost, meal 
blocks, and what you can use 
your DineX on, there are definite
ly a few holes in the system.
First of all, on the absolute 
lowest meal plan as a freshman, 
for fourteen days, you get 22 
meals and $78 DineX. With the 
average meal block costing about 
$7.25 or so, that equates to about 
$237.50. Thats a lot considering 
that I spent $120 at Trader Joes 
over a week ago and the food 
will probably last me until the 
end of the semester. Of course, 
there are those who can, and do, 
finish the highest meal plan on 
a regular basis, even finishing 
other peoples meals for them.
But lets be serious; those people 
are usually varsity athletes and 
they dont account for a giant 
percentage of our student popu
lation. Generally speaking, even 
the lowest meal plan is too much 
food for your average student.
Okay, so the meal plan for firstyears is too large. What about 
for upperclassmen? Carnegie 
Mellons lowest meal plan 
group costs about $1998.50 per 
semester. In the lowest bracket of 
this group, you can get 22 meals 
and $78 DineX per meal plan 
period; thats the equivalent of 
about 165 meals and $585 DineX 
per semester. For upperclassmen 
the highest plan is 15 meals and 
$10 DineX for every meal plan 
period, or 113 meals and $75 
DineX for the entire semester.
Theres kind of a disconnect 
there. After gaining sophomore 
status, you can get a plan that is 7 
meals less than the lowest fresh
man meal plan, but an entire 
$68 less in DineX? Seems a little 
disproportionate.
In terms of pricing and func
tionality of meal plans, lets 
compare ours to those of some 
of our peer institutions. Cornell 
Universitys most expensive plan 
is $2675 per semester, which pro
vides for unlimited meals, plus
8 bonus meals (designated for 
guests) and 300 Big Red Bucks. 
The cheapest plan has 14 meals 
every 2 weeks, four bonus meals, 
and 500 Big Red Bucks for the 
semester, all for $1840 per semes
ter. Assuming Big Red Bucks are 
the same as DineX in functional
ity and where they can be used, 
the fact still remains that Cornell 
freshman have the option of a 
plan that has eight fewer meals, 
with four extra meals designated 
for guests, and about $85 less 
in flexible cash than Carnegie
with so many international stu
dents, could be a good idea for 
Carnegie Mellon. They also have 
something called Case Cash 
(probably the equivalent to Plaid 
Ca$h), which they can use any
where that accepts their cards. 
This includes vending machines, 
campus eateries, washers and 
dryers, the bookstore, copy 
machines, the library, and the 
fitness rooms.
MIT doesnt even have a meal 
plan. They have whats called 
TechCash, probably also equivaGenerally speaking, even the lowest 
meal plan is too much food for your 
average student.
Mellon students. And all for 
about $150 less each semester.
At Case Western Reserve, 
anyone who is a first-year or 
living on campus is required to 
have a meal plan. (Its a good 
thing Carnegie Mellon doesnt 
operate on that system, because I 
like living on campus, but I didnt 
like having a meal plan.) However, 
at Case, they have the option of 
Kosher/Halal meal plans, which,
lent to Case Cash and PlaidCa$h. 
MIT students, like Case students, 
can use TechCash on and off cam
pus, to do laundry, at the library 
and for art supplies, for hardware, 
PC repair, for food, movies, and 
even haircuts. Our Plaid Ca$h 
doesnt have as many uses as Case 
Cash and TechCash.
So whats the best solution for 
Carnegie Mellons meal plan sys
tem? To not have a meal plan,
like MIT, could work. It gives 
students a lot more freedom 
and options, which are two 
things that our meal plan lacks. 
However, I think having funds 
designated for just food is a 
good idea because then people 
are less tempted to starve while 
they buy other things. So why 
cant we have a system that pro
vides a larger variety of plans so 
that students can eat as little or 
as much as they want?
We also need to revolution
ize how we deal with DineX 
funds. The idea of DineX going 
to waste at the end of every 
meal plan period is just foolish. 
Instead, the last day or so of 
the meal plan period could be a 
day where DineX can basically 
be used like Plaid Ca$h and 
for anything, and not just for 
stocking up on Gatorade and 
water. Meal plans are expensive, 
so we should allow students 
as much flexibility as possible 
to make their plan worth the 
money.

Kid Nation: More structured than summer camp
Sarah Mogin
Can 40 kids come together to 
run their own society? I have no 
idea. You might think Kid Nation, 
CBSs new reality show, answers 
this question, but it doesnt. The 
only question Kid Nation answers 
is this: Can 40 kids survive in 
an ultra-structured reality TV 
setting while surrounded by 
tumbleweeds, medics on call, 
and cheeky host Jonathan Karsh? 
Yes. Of course. But I wish they 
wouldnt bother.
Kid Nation is sort of Survivor 
meets Wild and Crazy Kids; 40 
kids, ages 8 to 15, live for 40 
days on an old movie set that the 
producers tell the kids is a west
ern ghost town called Bonanza 
City. They have to cook their own 
food, clean up after themselves, 
and settle their own disagree
ments  all of which, Ill admit, 
is mildly entertaining.
But, unfortunately for us 
viewers, theres more to Kid 
Nation than 8-year-olds strug
gling to make macaroni. The 
episodes are each obnoxiously 
structured, revolving around 
societal issues such as religion, 
politics, and the environment. In 
the beginning of each episode, 
the towns four leaders read from 
a book written by Bonanzas pre
vious inhabitants (i.e. the pro
ducers) that points them in the 
direction of the episodes theme. 
Next, the kids compete in a physi
cal challenge related to the theme 
(the one for the politics episode, 
for example, had something to 
do with presidents and piatas). 
And by the time another episode 
rolls around, the kids have com
pletely forgotten about whatever 
issue seemed so important just a 
couple days earlier.
Such intense episode 
structuring might suggest that, 
without it, Kid Nation wouldnt 
be worth its time slot. Maybe
nobody wants to watch a show 
about a bunch of kids coexisting 
peacefully  it certainly doesnt 
sound very dramatic.
But, if the only way to make 
Kid Nation watchable is to 
force overbearing themes on 
its participants, then maybe it 
shouldnt be a show in the first 
place. I mean, the world could 
always use another dating show 
to fill Kid Nations 43-minute 
block.
Almost as frustrating as Kid 
Nation itself is the legal mumbo 
jumbo that surrounds it. Now 
that the show has begun air
ing, parents of the kids involved 
are ranting that their children 
werent properly supervised. First 
of all, its pretty clear that the kids 
were pretty much surrounded by 
adults: the looming host, the 
ready-to-go medical personnel, 
and the cameramen, not to men
tion producers invisible guiding 
hands. If youve ever been to sum
mer camp, I think its safe to say 
that things there can get a little 
bit hairier. Also, the kids had the 
option to go home if they wanted 
to (a few of them did).
On top of that, CBS paid each 
kids parents $5000 for signing
Lizzee Solomon/Art Editor
their offspring up for the show, 
which  if it were my child  
would stop me from complain
ing. Before they could get the 
money, parents had to sign an 
extensive, funnier-than-the-show 
contract, waiving CBSs liability 
in regard to injury, sexually trans
mitted disease, or even death. If 
you ask me, parents who are stu
pid/greedy enough to sign that 
should be exiled to their own fake 
ghost town for 40 days  and 
they should stop complaining.
One thing that people havent 
been complaining about, how
ever, is Kid Nations not-so-subtle
allusions to alcohol. After a hard 
days work cooking oatmeal or, 
scrubbing the latrines (gross), 
the kids often stop by Bonanzas 
saloon for a cold one  a cold 
root beer, that is. And the really 
hardcore kids dont even bother 
with the bottle; they take shots 
of root beer syrup out of bona 
fide shot glasses. One episodes 
late-night saloon gathering 
seemed more like an evening 
at the fraternity quad, with kids 
clinking beer  I mean root 
beer  bottles in celebration, 
while others sought solace at 
the bottom of a shot glass. I 
bet the general store sells candy 
cigarettes.
. But warts and all, Kid Nation 
has some genuinely heartwarm
ing moments. We see the kids 
help 14-year-old DK after he 
pulls a muscle and can barely 
walk. We see 15-year-old Greg, 
the oldest of the bunch, start 
looking out for a kid that hed 
formerly bullied. And we see
10-year-old Zach, whos running 
to be a town leader, rehearsing 
his campaign speech with all 
the seriousness of a congress
man. There are funny moments 
too: During the religion epi
sode, 11-year-old Kelsey  who 
would make a great village idiot, 
if there was one  says that 
she doesnt know much about 
Jewish.
These moments more than 
anything make me wish that 
CBS just would let the kids of 
Kid Nation do their thing. Its 
fun watching them interact 
and spotting emerging leaders, 
loners, studs, and plastics (i.e. 
queen bees). If the kids would 
rather talk about cartoon char
acters than negotiate Bonanza 
City politics, then let them  Id 
choose cartoons, too.

it was really hard to come back

Football team destroys Bethany 42-19
FOOTBALL, fromA12through the middle of their 
defense. That says a lot about 
our offensive line. Theyve been 
great all year and I know theyll 
continue that next game.
The third quarter was more 
Carnegie Mellon, and more Car
negie Mellon running the ball. 
Bethany couldnt stop the tandem 
of Sivek and senior running back 
Robert Gimson. Sivek broke free 
for a 30-yard touchdown run on 
the opening drive of the second 
half, and Gimson scampered into 
the end zone from 15 yards out 
midway through the third quar
ter to increase the Tartan lead to 
42-13.
Senior safety Jon Scholl came 
up big for the Tartan defense, 
intercepting a v pass in the end 
zone, thwarting Bethanys scor
ing opportunity. Gimson scored 
his touchdown six plays later. 
Bethany managed a fourth-quar
ter touchdown but had the extra 
point blocked, making the score 
42-19.
I think its crazy that, despite 
the fact that we are struggling 
passing, that were still able to 
run the ball so well on teams even 
though they know were sort of a 
one-dimensional attack, Sivek 
said. I think its great that were 
still able to run it, and it says a 
lot about our blocking and how 
were consistently able to make 
all our blocks.
Sivek and Gimson both rushed 
for over 100 yards for the fourth 
time this season. Gimson led 
the team with 140 yards on the 
ground, and Sivek was close be
hind with 131 yards to go with 
his three touchdowns. Sivek is 
now in 20th place on the NCAA 
Division III scoring list with 348 
points for his career. Sivek is only 
24 yards shy of the 4000-yard 
mark for a career.
This win guarantees the 
Carnegie Mellon team its 33rd 
consecutive non-losing season. 
This win means a whole lot, 
Sivek said. It solidifies the non
losing season streak. [Overcom
ing] the adversity we had earlier 
in the year with four losses in a 
row, and to be able to fight back to 
be over .500 now, is really a great 
achievement for this team. Last 
year we were 10-0 and went to 
the playoffs, and that was a great 
achievement, but I think every
one on the team this year is very 
proud of our accomplishment to 
stay together, to keep fighting, 
and to keep winning and work
ing hard. Everyone is focused to 
win one more and possibly have 
a chance at ECACs if everything 
else works out well.

hit some passes, which we did. 
The one to Jeremy Doo was obvi
ously a big play that helped us out 
a lot early in the game. Primarily 
we just wanted to make sure that 
we could run the ball consistently 
offensively.
Bethany answered with a 
touchdown pass only to have 
the extra point fail, .making it 
7-6 Carnegie Mellon late in the 
first quarter. The Tartans began 
to pull away in the second quar
ter, scoring 21 straight points to 
increase their lead to 28-6 with 
just under four minutes to play in 
the half.
Sivek found the end zone on a 
3-yard run to make it 14-6, then 
senior linebacker Jonathan Bod
nar intercepted a pass for the 
third straight week. However, 
he went a step further Satur

Sivek added another touch

yards out, to put Carnegie Mel

Volleyball finishes third at UAAs
WOMENS, from A12
th net.
The match against Emory 
marked the last UAA game for 
the three seniors on the team: 
Howard, senior forward Kasey 
Stever, and senior midfielder 
Amanda Rose.
We all tried hard. We couldnt 
come up with a result against a 
nationally ranked team, Stever 
said. We played well and didnt
deserve to lose, but they are a 
really solid team. I am disap
pointed because yesterday we 
could have finished second in 
the UAA but instead we ended 
up in fifth. It was a weird game 
to end on because of so many 
outside factors. We put every
thing we learned all year to good 
use yesterday, and I think it will 
be beneficial to build on it next 
year.
I am very proud of how hard
we worked Saturday. We put up 
a great fight and came up a little 
short, Rose said. As a senior, 
it meant so much to me that we 
played with heart and didnt give 
up. Even though we lost, we are 
excited about postseason either 
NCAAs or ECACs and the chance 
to keep playing for a couple more 
games.

they make Eastern College Ath

match. Brackin led with 15 and 
an attack percentage of .591, 
followed by Amaechi (12) and

Griffin gathered 27 digs and 
three assists, while Stepp and 
sophomore Megan Killeen had 
15 and nine digs, respectively. 
Brackin, Amaechi, and Toney 
collected five, four, and three 
blocks, respectively.
The Wash. U. Bears stalled the 
Tartans momentum Saturday 
morning with a 3-0 win, destroy
ing Carnegie Mellons hopes for a 
UAA title. Carnegie Mellon came 
up short against the Bears all sea
son, losing to Wash. U. 2-3 in the 
second UAA Round Robin.
We didnt have as good a 
match against [Wash. U.] as 
we did the first time we played 
them, Toney said. They scouted 
us very well. Every serve receive, 
I could hear their coach yelling to 
the players the sets I was going to 
get and where I was going to be 
hitting from. They definitely had 
it out for us.
Carter had 28 assists and eight 
digs in the loss. Brackin led the 
offense with eight kills, followed 
by Stepp, who recorded six. Grif
fin contributed nine digs to the 
Tartan total.
The Tartans rebounded and 
squashed Brandeis 3-1 (30-26, 
26-30, 30-20, 30-18) in the 
third-place match. The win vin
dicated the Tartans, who fell to 
the Judges 2-3 at the second UAA 
Round Robin.
Brandeis is ranked in their 
region, so it looks good [that] we 
finished above them in our con
ference, Toney said. We played 
a great match. We slipped in the 
second match, but after that we 
came out and cleaned up.
Carter again led the Tartans 
with 53 assists during the match. 
Brackin, Stepp, and Killeen re
corded 11 kills apiece while 
Toney added 10. Griffin led Car

added eight digs each.
The Tartans complete their 
season with a 20-15 record

Tartan womens volleyball takes third place at UAAs
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Over the weekend, the wom
ens volleyball team finished 
in third place at the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
championship in Rochester, N.Y. 
The Tartans swept the University 
of Rochester and Case Western 
Reserve University Friday be
fore falling to the fourth-ranked
Washington (Mo.) University 
Saturday morning.
Carnegie Mellon rallied to de
feat Brandeis University in the 
third-place match, while Emory 
University conquered Wash. U. 
in the championship match 3-2 
Saturday afternoon.
First or second would have 
been nice, but third is very im
pressive, senior middle hitter 
Abbie Toney said. [Emory is] 
a great team. They have two
amazing middles that ran circles 
around us and most definitely 
around Wash. U.
On ' Friday, the Tartans 
outmatched the Rochester Yellowjackets in three straight sets 
30-20, 30-24, 30-26. Carnegie 
Mellon also defeated Rochester 
3-0 three weeks ago at the sec
ond UAA Round Robin.
Sophomore setter Samantha 
Carter led the Tartan offense 
with 43 assists and six service
aces. Toney and first-year middle 
hitter Caroline Size tallied 10 
kills apiece, while senior outside 
hitter Kate Stepp recorded seven. 
Sophomore middle hitter Jess 
Brackin and junior middle hit
ter Chisom Amaechi each added 
eight kills and three blocks to the 
Tartans total.
First-year defensive special
ist Cameron Griffin had 25 digs 
during the match, while junior 
defensive specialist Liz DeVleming followed with 10. Carter and 
Stepp had nine digs apiece.
The Tartans success continued 
Friday afternoon as they over
took Case 3-0 (30-25, 30-20,

second victory against Case this 
season. Carnegie Mellon de

Carnegie Mellon womens soccer falls to Emory Eagles 1-0
by Elizabeth Haldane
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon wom
ens soccer team concluded the 
2007 regulation season this past 
weekend. The Tartans traveled 
to Atlanta to take on the 11thranked Emory University Eagles 
and came home with a 1-0 loss. 
The Tartans finish the season 
with a 8-6-2 record overall and 
a 3-3-1 record in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA).
The Tartans had the opportu
nity to finish second in the UAA 
if they defeated the Eagles. How
ever, Saturdays loss dropped 
Carnegie Mellon down to a tie 
for fifth place with Brandeis 
University.
Carnegie Mellon came out 
strong in the first 20 minutes
of the first half, but then Emory 
changed its playing formation 
from 4-4-2 to 3-5-1, which 
threw off the Tartan defense.
Moments after this change in 
attack, Emory capitalized on a 
corner kick opportunity when 
Eagles midfielder Joyce Lam 
placed a ball into the box for 
Emory forward Maya Vankineni 
to finish into the back of the net. 
Vankineni scored the games sole 
goal in the 31st minute.
At halftime, the Tartans 
switched to 3-5-1 to better de
fend against the Eagles. Carnegie 
Mellon held off Emorys defense 
and was able to stabilize its own 
offense. The Tartans created a 
major scoring opportunity in 
the 87th minute after the ball 
was served into the middle of 
the field after a cross, and senior 
midfielder Jessica Howard rifled
a shot on goal that senior Eagles 
goalkeeper Emily Fedeles got her 
hands on.
Emory out-shot the Tartans
11-9. First-year Tartan goal
keeper Anya Rosen made six 
saves and Fedeles made six saves 
to maintain a shutout.
This season, we had our ups 
and downs. We really grew as a 
team, head coach Sue Willard 
said. The game against Emory 
was interesting. We really were 
taking it to them in the first 20 
minutes, then they changed their 
playing formation-. At halftime, 
we did the same to counter them.

thing I asked them to do. They 
left it all on the field. Unfortu

The football team came out 
strong Saturday with a seasonhigh 42 points on the way to 
defeating the hosting Bethany 
Bison 42-19, extending Carn
egie Mellons winning streak 
to three games and moving the 
teams record to 5-4. Bethany 
dropped to 4-5.
The Tartans rushed the ball 
for over 350 yards against the 
Bison, yet it was a passing play 
that got Carnegie Mellon on the

first possession was capped 
with a 33-yard touchdown pass 
from sophomore quarterback 
Phil Pantalone to senior receiver 
Jeremy Doo, marking the sec

Emory overtakes Tartan mens soccer team 4-0

Senior Sports Staff
The 17th-ranked Eif ory Eagles 
overpowered the Carnegie Mellon mens soccer team Saturday 
in University Athletic Associa
tion (UAA) action, beating the 
Tartans 4-0 to wrap up the regu
lar season for both teams.
The hosting Eagles improve to
16-2 overall and finish 6-1 in the 
UAA, good for second place only 
to Rochester. The Tartans finish 
the regular season at 9-5-2 and
0-5-2 in the UAA, good for sev
enth place.
The Emory duo of Patrick 
Carver and Patrick McFarland 
kept up their torrid offensive 
statistics against the Tartans on 
Saturday. Each notched a pair 
of goals, giving Carver a UAAleading 16 on the season, with 
McFarland close behind with 12 
goals and a UAA-high 12 assists.
Carver got the Eagles on the 
board in the 13th minute, and 
McFarland -scored on a rebound 
two and a half minutes later. The 
score remained at 2-0 heading 
into halftime with the Tartans 
unable to get off a shot in the first 
half  a testament to Emorys 
defense, which has only allowed 
12 goals in 18 games this season.
Carver netted his second goal 
of the game in the 51st min
ute, and McFarland knocked in 
his second goal of the game in 
the 84th minute to wrap up the 
scoring.
Their players up top on 
offense were very good, sopho
more forward Ricky Griffin said. 
They were very hard to stop
one on one. Their midfielders 
made runs forward and their 
outside backs would attack and 
get crosses over. Theyre a very 
dangerous team and were very 
hard for us to stop. It seemed like 
we never got possession really. 
Theyre good at covering for each 
other. Their offense really helped 
their defense by not giving up the 
ball so it was hard for us to attack 
them.
Carnegie Mellon junior goal
keeper Matthew Bazin stopped 
four shots in the loss, while Em
ory goalkeeper Keith Meehan 
made two saves en route to his 
sixth shutout of the season.
Our record shows that the 
UAA is tough, Griffin said. 
With the exception of Saturday, 
we were in all those games. If a 
couple bounces had gone our 
way early in the UAA, we could 
have done better. Things sort of 
snowballed after we lost a couple 
games early. The UAA teams are 
the best teams weve played this 
year.

fins 11 goals over the course 
of their 16-game regular sea

Over the weekend, the Tartan 
football team extended its cur
rent winning streak to three 
games with a win over Bethany 
College. The teams record is 
now 5-4 with the final game of 
the season Saturday at Gesling 
Stadium.
After being named UAA
Special Teams Player of the 
Week for the third time this sea
son, senior punter Matt Adams 
sat down with The Tartan to talk 
about his season and about be
ing a student athlete at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Tartan: When did you start 
playing football, and how did 
you get into it?
Adams: I just really loved 
football and I started playing 
in second grade. It was a youth 
tackle league, it was a travel 
team, and I was a little young to 
be playing, but I really wanted 
to play then.
T: Have you always been a 
punter?
A: I actually didnt start punt
ing until college. I had always 
played running back and mid
dle linebacker, and then my 
freshman year here I played at 
running back and punted, and 
then after that year I switched 
to just punting.
T: Was football a part of your 
decision to come to Carnegie 
Mellon?
A: Actually, not so much. I 
was deciding between playing 
Division I lacrosse, or coming
A
here for the academics, but 
I knew in coming here that I 
would be able to play both foot
ball and lacrosse.
T: How do you manage athlet
ics and academics at Carnegie 
Mellon?
A: Its actually a lot easier for 
me during season. I get better 
grades in season, and I really 
just know I have to be a lot 
more disciplined in getting work 
done.
T: Do you have any pre-game 
rituals?
A: I just like to get rested for 
a game-. I think if I went a whole 
week without kicking I would 
probably have the best game of 
my life, but you can only rest 
so much before you actually get 
out ofshape.
T: Do you have a favorite 
place to play?
A: I really like our stadium. 
Its really nice, and the surface 
is always consistent and even, so 
planting the ball is never really 
an issue.
T: Do you have a most memo
rable game or accomplishment 
youre particularly proud of?
A: This past season I got the 
punting record for the longest 
kick, a 70-yard punt, and then, 
[against] Washington, I had a 
really good kick that set us up 
for a safety on the next play, so it 
was really nice to have contrib
uted in that sense.
T: Do you have a favorite 
place to travel and play?
A: Yes, definitely Chicago. Its 
always a really fun trip.
T: Whats your favorite part of 
the off-season?
A: I play lacrosse during the 
off-season, and I have actually 
been a captain there for the past 
three years, so Im actually even 
busier then. Its a club sport, but 
we play on the national level, so 
its pretty intense.
T: What are your plans for 
after graduation?
A: I have a job offer in invest
ment banking that Ive accepted, 
but a lot of people have joked 
that I should train and go to 
NFL combines to try and punt. 
I dont know if I actually could, 
but I think it would be really 
cool to try. I would be the first 
person from CMU to even go to 
the combines, so well see.
SPORTS COMMENTARY
College football remains 
unpredictable
Sam Kim
With only a few weeks left 
in the college football season, 
no one can be sure who will 
make it to the BCS National 
Championship game. The pre
season favorite USC Trojans 
have fallen in the standings, 
losing to teams like Stanford 
and Oregon. A previously un
known South Florida team is 
now ranked second in the na
tion. Even if you watch college 
football closely, it is hard to 
predict What teams will meet in 
the title game.
In the first couple weeks of 
the season, all the top teams 
including USC, LSU, and West 
Virginia dominated, except for 
the fifth-ranked Michigan. In 
the biggest upset in recent col
lege football memory, Michi
gan fell to Division II Appala
chian State.
Then, in the third week of 
the season, perennial Big East 
power Louisville fell to a resil
ient Kentucky team that would 
also later defeat LSU. Boston 
College also began its ascent 
into the BCS contention by 
beating Georgia Tech.
However, it wasnt until the 
fifth and sixth weeks of the 
season that fans saw some truly 
remarkable upsets. South Flor
ida, which only started its foot
ball program in 1997, upset last 
years Big East winner, fifthranked West Virginia, 21-13.
The lOth-ranked Rutgers 
team fell to Maryland, and 
second-ranked USC lost a tight 
game to a weak Stanford team. 
The fourth-ranked Florida team 
lost a close game to Auburn, 
and seventh-ranked Texas was 
blown out by Kansas State.
From that point in the sea
son, a number of teams occu
pied the number-two ranking, 
including USC, LSU, California, 
South Florida, and Boston Col
lege. Even without last years 
Heisman Trophy-winner Troy 
Smith, Ohio State remained 
undefeated and climbed up to 
the number-one ranking.
However, because of their 
rough schedule, the Ohio State 
Buckeyes will probably not 
make the national title game. 
For the most part, the Buck
eyes have played against non
ranked teams with the excep
tion of games against Purdue 
and Penn State. Saturdays vic
tory against Wisconsin helps 
Ohio State, but the Buckeyes
------------------------------------4-----------------
still need to face Michigan in 
what is sure to be an epic re
match.
Although West Virginia 
seemed to regain its groove af
ter losing to South Florida, the 
team has one of the toughest 
schedules ahead. West Virginia 
still has to play against Louis
ville, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, 
and the surprising 13th-ranked 
University of Connecticut 
team.
When BCs Matt Ryan com
pleted a pass to Andre Callender 
in the last 11 seconds of the 
game to overtake the eighthranked Virginia Tech, I thought 
Boston College could make it to 
the BCS National Champion
ship game. However, Florida 
States defense shut down Matt 
Ryan and his offense this past 
Saturday.
I am convinced that fifthranked Oregon, which had a 
decisive victory over an unde
feated fourth-ranked Arizona 
State team, will make it to the 
BCS championship game.
After an embarrassing
season last year, Oregons quar
terback Dennis Dixon stepped 
up to lead the Ducks offense 
this year.
With the exception of a loss 
to California, the Ducks have 
defeated top-ranked teams 
like Michigan, USC, and now 
Arizona State. With a relatively 
light schedule the rest of the 
season, the Ducks are in a good 
position to make a run to the 
championship game.
Since the championship 
game will be held in New Or
leans, its only fitting that LSU 
joins BC in the final game of the 
regular season. Number-three 
ranked LSU has played one of 
the toughest schedules this 
year, winning against several 
top-ranked teams including 
Virginia Tech, Florida, Auburn, 
and South Carolina.
On Saturday, LSU showed 
that even former LSU coach 
Nick Sabans Alabama couldnt 
stop Les Miless offensive weap
ons either.
If Oregon and LSU meet up 
in the BCS title game, it will 
be interesting to see which of
fense will win out. Ultimately, 
I believe LSU will find a way to 
rein in the national title in front 
of the home crowd. Regardless 
of whoever makes the BCS title 
game, this season, with its up
sets everywhere, has been one 
of the best college football sea
sons to watch.

New meals for the new Entropy
Entropy (now Entropy+) got pimped. It is larger, 
cooler-looking, and has much more food. There are 
so many more choices, especially if you're looking 
for gluten-free, kosher, vegan, or organic items  
including a variety of frozen treats. There is also 
plenty of fresh produce, virtually eliminating the need 
to go grocery shopping off campus (unless of course 
you want lower prices). But despite all these changes, 
the Entropy+ aisles are still filled with the junk food 
and snacks many Carnegie Mellon students have 
come to depend on.
Below are some interesting and wacky recipes to try 
with all the new things you can buy at Entropy+.

Everything you need to know
About cheating roommates and third wheels
Dear Myrtle, Dear Myrtle,
My best friend, Evan, just 
got a new boyfriend, Steve, 
and I cant stand him. Its not 
romantic jealousy  I dont like 
Evan that way, at least not since 
fourth grade when he explained 
to me that he liked boys. Its 
just garden-variety jealousy, 
the kind where I miss watching 
movies with him without having 
to pretend I dont notice them 
smooching during the slow parts, 
or having long conversations 
about books and movies without 
Steve interrupting to talk about 
(I swear) education reform in 
Indonesia. Whenever I ask Evan 
to do something, Steve is always 
there. I want my best friend to 
have a good relationship, but I 
want to hang out with him and 
not them all the time.
Third Wheel And Not Glad
Hey there, TWANG,
As rock genius Elvis Costello once 
said, Can it be so hard to calculate? 
Three goes into two  there's 
nothing left over. But all is not lost, 
TWANG. It's likely that Evan is going 
through an infatuation stage when 
he and Steve just can't be apart. 
Healthy relationships move past this 
stage, but you don't have to wait for 
this to happen. Evan is your best 
friend  talk to him! Tell him that 
you like hanging out with the pair of 
them, but that you also need some 
Evan time for just the two of you. 
Its okay to tell him that you miss the 
old days. Everybody likes to know 
that theyre missed! You don't need 
to teli Evan that you cant stand" 
Steve, though  thats not likely 
to help your case. After all, maybe 
you would be able to stand him if he 
wasnt always attached to your best 
friend's hip. All things  even Steve 
 are best in moderation, after all. 
Hopefully, Evan will figure that out 
soon.
Good luck,
Myrtle
My roommate is cheating on 
his girlfriend. He tries to hide it, 
but Ive heard him on the phone, 
trying to be quiet as he sets up 
some nighttime rendezvous, 
assuring whatever girl it is that 
 Shelley wont find out. What 
should I do? Should I tell Shelley? 
Should I confront my roommate? 
This isnt malicious or anything 
 I get along with my roommate 
pretty well, and Im not trying to 
move in on the girlfriend (way 
too high-maintenance). But Ive 
been cheated on in the past, 
and Id be pissed if I found out 
people knew but didnt tell me. 
What should I do?
A Worried Witness
Hello AWW,
Thats a tricky situation you're in 
there, but your first step is definitely 
to talk to your roommate, not the 
girlfriend. Tell him you know whats 
going on, and tell him how you feel 
about it. I know what its like to 
be cheated on, man, and it sucks. 
Dont do this to Shelley. Either 
dump her or quit messing around." 
If he doesnt seem to be listening, 
you can tell Shelley about her jerk 
boyfriend if you want, but youll 
be resigning yourself to life with a 
roommate who hates you. Its the 
right thing to do, but make sure you 
know what youre getting into. Its 
not your job to martyr yourself for 
someone elses girlfriend.
Cheers,
Myrtle

Students organize events for change
Origami
The science of folding paper
Students and faculty may have been surprised on their way 
into physicist Robert Lang's lecture Monday. They weren't 
handed sheets with equations or complex physics laws that 
he discovered. Instead, they were given pieces of paper with 
dotted lines on them.
Lang has an unusual hobby: origami. More specifically, Lang 
is concerned with the science of origami. Over the course of 
his hour-long lecture, he convinced the audience that origami 
is not just a coffee-break puzzle for high-brow academics, 
but rather a field that the scientific community should take 
seriously.
Lang started the lecture by giving a brief history of origami. 
He discussed its initial functionality as an art form in Chinese 
and Japanese cultures and its subsequent move into the 
global mainstream. Although origami as art has been in the 
Western world for years, its popularity soared only after it 
captured the attention of scientists and mathematicians in 
the '70s and '80s.
Lang has worked [with car 
companies], simulating the 
transition of a folded airbag to a 
fully expanded one using origami. 
Origami can save lives, he said.
Today, origami is used in everything from car commercials to 
industrial design. As an example, Lang played a Mitsubishi 
commercial that used origami designs exclusively. The 
commercial featured a car speeding through forests and 
suburban street as a dragon was chasing it. Lang himself was 
responsible for both the design and the actual folding of the 
origami featured in the commercial.
Lang then explained the actual folding process, claiming that 
any 3-D shape can be made using a set of origami "moves."
In the construction of distinct origami points, for example, 
the 2-D folding pattern takes the shape of a circle. By folding 
through the center point of the circle, the shape becomes 
increasingly narrow; the user can then fold it in half until they 
reach the desired width. By using this technique, the user 
can create end-points to an origami piece, such as insect legs 
or moose antlers. Lang brought these procedures to life by 
showing origami animals he had constructed.
Origami has practical applications, as well. Since high-end 
car companies like Mercedes-Benz cant afford to continually 
crash cars for safety tests, they developed airbag simulation 
programs. Lang has worked on these programs, simulating 
the transition of a folded airbag to a fully expanded one using 
origami. Origami cn save lives," he said.
Students left Monday's lecture with more than just a stack ' 
of folded paper; they left with an understanding of origamis 
importance in everyday life.

Matt Siffert I Assistant Pillbox Editor
November is the month of giving thanks for what we have  
and for helping others who dont have. Heres a spotlight on 
two upcoming events designed to help improve the lives of 
others:
Cans Across the Cut
Hosted by Carnegie Mellons Staff Council, [Cans Across 
the Cut] is a competitive food drive in which various teams 
compete to collect the most donations. Any group is eligible 
to enter, including student organizations, residence halls, and 
academic departments. Each team will line up its donations 
with the goal of reaching from one end of the Cut to the other. 
Last year's first-place winner was Delta Upsilon with 1073 
cans donated, followed by Phi Kappa Theta and Pi Kappa 
Alpha.
"The objective of the event is to get students involved in 
Carnegie Mellons annual food drive 'in a fun, visible way, 
said Carole Panno, co-chair of the events committee.
This is the third year for [Cans Across the Cut.] Jennifer Cox, 
yearly coordinator of the event, came up with the idea after 
seeing the efforts of Colorado State University.
"I received my bachelors degree [there] where they held an 
event called [Cans Around the Oval] to collect canned goods 
for those in need, Cox said. I thought it would be great to 
modify the event and created [Cans Across the Cut.]
The Staff Council has several representatives who help 
run the event,, including Co-Chairs Panno, Cox, and Gloria 
Dadowski, Staff Council Communications Co-Chair Lindie 
Droulia, and Honorary Faculty Chair Jean Alexander. In 
addition to these organizing members, there are mafty 
volunteers for the actual event, including students who will 
aid in counting the donations. All members of the committee 
encourage the campus community to participate in the event.
"I hope that each year more and more students, faculty, and 
staff members on campus will realize how important it is to 
help others in our community who are in need, Cox said. "Its 
so easy to [forget] that even though we struggle to make ends' 
meet, there are so many others who are less fortunate than 
those of us [at Carnegie Mellon].
Donations will be accepted in the form of non-perishable 
food and household products as well as gift certificates for 
grocery stores (but those are harder to line up across the Cut). . 
All donations will benefit the Greater Pittsburgh Community 
Food Bank.
Cans Across the Cut takes place Nov. 7 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m.
These Hands Dont Hurt
In another form of social service, students at the University of 
Pittsburgh have created a gallery exhibit called These Hands 
Don't Hurt, opening Nov. 5. The event, organized by this 
years Sexual Assault Services interns Alex Schwall, Catherine 
Moran, and Rachael Kraus, attempts to raise awareness about 
sexuaT assault among college students in order to help prevent 
future incidents.
The interns approached male organizations on the Pitt 
campus, such as fraternities, asking members to pledge not 
to commit sexual assault. Each male solidified his pledge by 
putting his handprint and signature on a poster board, which 
will be showcased in the These Hands Don't Hurt exhibit.
In addition to visiting male organizations, the interns also 
set up an area outside the William Pitt Student Union where 
male students could participate in the pledge. Females were 
not included in this year's event, but one of the interns, Alex 
Schwall, hopes that will change in the future.
We focused on males because a lot of [sexual assaults] on our 
campus have been with female victims, Schwall said. But I 
hope that in the future they will do both genders. The interns 
, also hope that other campuses will follow Pitts lead and hold 
their own version of the event in the future.
The exhibit runs from Nov. 5 to Nov. 16 on Pitts campus at 
the William Pitt Student Union's Kimbo Gallery. The official 
opening is Nov. 7 from 7 to 9 p.m. Refreshments will be 
provided.

The Cult returns with Born Into This
If the last two editions of Rock Star (a Making the 
Band-like TV show) are any indication, one thing can 
be said about the state of hard rock and metal: Talented, 
charismatic singers are in short supply. Perhaps that 
may explain the Velvet Revolvers and Audioslaves (and, 
if youre my age, the Night Rangers and Asias) of the 
world. To many rock fans, a good, road-worn lead singer 
is worth all the guitar and drum virtuosos combined. Up 
on stage, the vocalist can't fake that kind of connection 
with his or her audience. Part ringmaster and part 
party facilitator, lead singers are what drive the concert 
experience and leave the biggest imprint on any rock 
album.
Bands with singers of this status dont release albums 
that often, and so The Cults Born Into This, out last 
October, certainly merits a review. While the title is 
self-explanatory, the first single, "Dirty Little Rockstar, 
eliminates any doubt that this is sleaze rock taken to an 
almost religious experience.
With a back catalog like the Cults, there is no need to 
introduce the band, but let me tryjor those unfamiliar: 
Without a doubt, every shortlist of top-10 rock singers of 
the last two decades includes Cult vocalist Ian Astbury.
If you dont believe me, ask the surviving members of 
the Doors, who thought Astbury worthy to sing in the 
band's 2002 revival. Like Jim Morrisons, Astburys 
voice is simply iconic  immediately recognizable
 but the Cult has been sorely missed these past few 
years. Label troubles put a quick and sour end to the last 
album/tour cycle in 2001 for Beyond Good and Evil, after
Fashion trend
which Astbury went on to front the reunited Doors. Still, 
the interplay between Astbury and Billy Duffy (Cults 
guitarist) floats along the same lofty clouds as Jagger/ 
Richards or Bono/Edge, and this music is too powerful 
to stay down for long. I am glad to say it remains 
as large-sounding now with Born Into This as it did 
decades ago with Sonic Temple.
On Born Into This, "Holy Mountain is an acoustic 
piece that reflects Astburys travels to India and 
the Himalayas, and the song is as sincere and 
unrestrained as the rest of the album. As uplifting as 
it is introspective, Holy Mountain can be taken as 
symbolic of the cycle of incline and decline in Astburys 
life and career. I Assassin has a beefy groove to it, 
and Tiger in the Sun soars. Illuminated is classic 
Cult, with a beautiful melody, while Citizens" updates 
that classic sound, if possible, just holding back as you 
expect it to explode. Speaking of which, the addition 
of John Tempesta on drums works surprisingly well. 
Coming from the metal world  having played with 
Exodus, Testament, and White Zombie to name a 
few  Tempestas energy fills in the space around the 
orchestrated chaos that Astbury/Duffy have created 
once again.
This is an album to love and make love to, and the Cult a 
phoenix that, while repeatedly burned, continues to rise.

Cheap and chic: Designer frocks at reasonable prices
Fashion veterans are recreating their brands, audiences, 
and ultimately themselves in the form of spin-off labels 
available at bargain retail stores. Designer clothing 
which would cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars 
is now available at Target and Kohls, ranging in price 
from $10 to $100.
collaborated with Swedish retailer H&M in 2004, has 
vowed to never again repeat the arrangement. Lagerfeld 
created a limited line available at 20 H&M stores in 
Europe, and although his designs were successful, he 
was unhappy with the arrangement, claiming H&M did 
not make enough clothes to satisfy shoppers demands.
On music and the Internet
Its easy to find agreement on the Internet. Just type in a band name 
on www.last.fm and youll find hundreds of fellow listeners, along with 
suggestions for other similar" bands to listen to, but are they really 
similar? Most websites list bands together based on who listens 
to them, not how they sound. They base their statistics on average 
listening habits, which says little about the actual quality of music.
For example, post-punk bands The Sound and The Chameleons have 
both clearly influenced the group Interpol; the music sounds the same 
stylistically, and the guitar work dn some Chameleons songs is eerily 
reminiscent of certain Interpol lines. But neither band appears on Last, 
fms Similar to Interpol list  instead, the website recommends The 
Arcade Fire and Modest Mouse, bands that sound nothing like Interpol 
and just represent some sort of indie band Zeitgeist that has nothing to 
do with the music.
Music-based social networking does not reveal true musical 
connections, which is a problem, because most people arent willing to 
look any further. Average listeners are often uninterested in expanding 
their musical educations; they seek little beyond what is fed to them by 
the Internet or their friends. But services like Last.fm cannot replace the 
time and effort needed to find new exciting artists. For truly new music, 
listeners have to look elsewhere.
One idea is www.scaruffi.com, run by Piero Scaruffi, who cfaims its one 
of the first websites ever. Scaruffi updates frequently with truckloads 
of new content, including contemporary music reviews. He has his 
own strong opinions and isnt afraid to share them. Ive probably found 
more new artists that Ive loved from Scaruffi than from any online taste 
aggregator so far, even though I disagree with many of his opinions.
I remember being crushed when reading his thoughts on Bjork, a 
musician I love; he wrote, The first impression with Bjorks music is 
always of something terribly trivial, obnoxious and, ultimately, boring. 
But Scaruffi also led me to Robert Wyatts Rock Bottom, an album 
which not only earned me some serious cred with my dad, but also 
introduced me to one of the most beautiful male voices in rock, along 
with some really weird song structures. By exposing myself to the 
opinions of one other person who really loves music, Ive discovered 
more than I would have by following the aggregated listening habits of 
a million others.
So, next time youre looking for something new to listen to, ask just 
one person. Better yet, ask one cranky opinionated guy on the Internet 
who thinks Captain Beefheart is possibly the greatest rock musician of 
all time.
Designer Isaac Mizrahi started the trend when he 
landed a deal with Target in 2003. In keeping with 
his high-fashion audience, Mizrahi also signed a deal 
to create a couture collection in 2003 with high-end 
department store Bergdorf Goodman. Reviews of 
Mizrahis line have been favorable and the fall 2007 line 
available at Target promises to keep with his tradition of 
creating functional, well-fitted basics for every womans 
closet.
Vera Wang is the latest to unleash an affordable clothing 
label, Simply Vera, which became available in Kohls 
department stores this year. Wang, who-initially became 
famous for her bridal gown designs, has since extended 
her brand to include ready-to-wear clothing, jewelry, 
footwear, and eyewear. Her products are centered on 
essential design elements such as comfort and style, 
details, layering, and mixing textures.
Such cheap-and-chic ventures are not without their 
mishaps. Chanel and Fendi designer Karl Lagerfeld, who
I find it embarrassing that H&M let down so many 
people," Lagerfeld said in Factio Magazine. I dont 
think that is very kind, especially for people in small 
towns and countries in Eastern Europe. It is snobbery  
created by anti-snobbery. Since Lagerfelds clothes 
were sold in such limited quantities, the people who 
were actually able to buy them have been selling them 
online for high prices, which goes against his original 
intent of creating an affordable line of clothing.
As designers realize the potential and practicality 
of greating easily accessible designs, fashionistas 
everywhere can look forward to this trend of affordability 
continuing in the fashion world.

Pittsburghs best sushi
Try Chaya for the best, Oishii Bento for the cheapest, and Nakama for the show
Ah, sushi. The food-gasmic thrill of the freshest fish melting 
on your tongue, the electric jolt of the wasabi, the tang of soy 
sauce, and the fishy crunch of smelt caviar. But somehow, the 
stale packaged sushi available in Entropy+ just doesnt seem 
to satisfy the craving. So where to; sushi seekers?
The citys best and most authentic Japanese food is served up 
at Chaya, a one-room restaurant on Murray Avenue crammed 
with Japanese art and collectibles, a tiny fountain, and packs . 
of hungry customers. Along with a la carte sushi 
and sashimi, Chaya offers sushi combination 
dinners and other traditional Japanese dishes like 
pork cutlets, cold soba noodles, and tempura. You 
really cant go wrong here.
For the best cheap sushi, head down Forbes 
Avenue toward the University of Pittsburgh, 
where you have four choices: Oishii Bento,
Sushi Boat, Ginza, and Saigon-Tokyo. Oishii Bento is 
a cute, cozy restaurant thats always packed at lunchtime. 
Oishii Bento, which means yummy lunchbox," specializes 
in Japanese-style lunchboxes, meals with compartments 
containing Korean or Japanese entres along with delicious 
sides. Oishii's sushi isnt as good as Chayas, but its also 
substantially cheaper. Or you could head across the street 
to Sushi Boat, ideal for some quick, cheap-but-good rolls 
or rice bowls  ah, what a delicious quandary. One block 
down on Atwood Street, you'll find another Korean-Japanese 
combination in Ginza. Ginza is best known for its authentic 
home-cooked Korean food, but it features a popular sushi bar.
Finally, Saigon-Tokyo, a blend of Vietnamese and Japanese 
cuisine, offers delicious nigiri (flat pieces of fish on top of pats  
of rice) as well as Vietnamese dishes like pho and vermicelli.
If youre in Shadyside, Sushi Too is a good bet for satisfying, 
moderately priced sushi. Try the Oh My God roll and you're - 
likely to say its name, and  if youre feeling adventurous  
try the chirashi (mixed sashimi on top of a rice bowl).
The Orient Kitchen is a surprising gem on Baum Boulevard. 
(It may seem off the beaten path, but the Orient Kitchen is 
actually just a block away from one of the Carnegie Mellon 
shuttle stops.) The restaurant offers what some would 
argue is the citys most authentic Chinese food, as well as 
incredibly fresh sushi. Try one of the rice bowls; the sake don 
is particularly good. Don't go on Monday, though  thats the 
sushi chefs well-deserved night off.
Japanese steakhouse Nakama on the South Side has 
regularly been voted the citys best Japanese restaurant, 
but its hardly authentic. The atmosphere is dark, crowded, 
and loud, leaving something to be desired. The show (a
Benihana-like experience) can be fun, especially if you get the 
chef named Ki, and the hibachi is inarguably delicious. If you 
can get past the atmosphere and price, the sushi is excellent.
Also worth a try is Pacific Ring on Murray Avenue, which 
features an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet (a traditional Japanese 
custom  not!): This buffet is a little too expensive and 
rule-laden (you must finish everything on your plate before 
ordering another) to really be worth it, but the sushi is fresh 
and delicious.
If you're hanging out in the Strip District, 
try Sushi Kim, another Japanese-Korean 
combination, which is most affordable if you visit 
in a group. Mondays are sushi-only nights, with 
10 percent off your total order  yum!
In sum, sushi-lovers: Go to Chaya for the best, 
Oishii Bento for the cheapest, and Nakama for the show. 
Then, visit a different sushi place every week to try all the 
rest.

Experimental film comes to Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh Filmmakers Three Rivers Film Festival returns
For fans of experimental film, this years Three Rivers Film 
Festival, presented by the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, should 
provide plenty of options. The festival will showcase a variety 
of movie genres, including foreign, independent, and classic.
The festival, in its 26th year, opened Friday with a showing of 
Oscar-contender Grace is Gone. The film stars John Cusack, 
portraying a father unable to tell his young daughters their 
mother has died in Iraq. "The content is as strong as it gets," 
said'Andrew Swensen,.director of Pittsburgh Filmmakers.
The Cannes, Toronto, and Sundance film festivals are some of 
the industrys biggest festivals. Swensen said, The films that 
were showing, we are getting them fresh off of many of these 
festivals; many of our films are award winners at these other 
festivals.
This year's festival emphasizes experimental film and digital 
media. Present on the schedule are two programs from Mark 
McElhatten, curator of the New York Film Festivals Views 
from the Avant-Garde." McElhatten reviewed films from 
the New York Festival to bring to Three Rivers, allowing 
Pittsburghers to view the best and most recent movies out of 
Americas largest city.
The festival features some special lectures, including a 
talk with McElhatten Nov. 10. Many of the films will also 
have receptions following their viewings, in addition to 
appearances from the filmmakers behind them. For this 
reason, Pittsburgh Filmmakers began planning this years 
festival as early as last December. The reason we start 
planning so early, Swensen said, "is it takes a long time to 
get on these peoples calendars."
The culmination of this years festival will be the viewing of 
several films by noted experimental filmmaker Kenneth Anger, 
as well as an appearance by the famed underground director. 
Other appearances during the festival, which runs through 
Nov 15, will include the directors of films Golden Days, Punk's 
Not Dead, Pascua Lama, and The Blue Eyed Six.
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust worked with the Three Rivers 
Festival, leading to the inclusion of the films Walkabout 
and Kalkadoon Man, an extension of the Cultural Trusts 
Australia Festival. The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, the 
Carnegie Mellons Student Development Office of Artistic and 
Intellectual Development, and PITT ARTS also worked with 
the Pittsburgh Filmmakers to create this years Three Rivers 
Film Festival.
Some films shown in the weeks ahead will highlight film 
achievement around the world. Filmmakers will be showing 
The Band's Visit, an Israeli film about an Egyptian police 
band lost in Israel. The film was recently disqualified as the 
country's nomination for the Oscar for Best Foreign Film 
because less than 50 percent of its dialog was non-English. 
The Band's Visit's replacement for Israels nomination is 
another Three Rivers selection, Beaufort, which follows the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon in 2000.
Swensen said he is looking forward to the showing of Woody 
Allens 1979 masterpiece Manhattan, as well as Eloquent 
Nude, a documentary following the photography of Edward
 Weston and his relationship with subject Charis Wilson. He 
has already seen and enjoyed many of the festivals films, 
including his current favorite The Violin, a Mexican film about 
street musicians living in an oppressive society in the 1970s.
With an excellent selection, the Three Rivers Festival has 
something to attract any movie buff.

Matt Damon kicks ass yet again/ 
in the third installment of the 
Bourne trilogy. Damon stars as 
Jason Bourne, still on a quest 
to find out who he really is, 
and causing enough crashing, 
shooting, glass-breaking, and 
kung fu to go around. Like the 
previous films, The Bourne 
Ultimatum is the perfect 
combination of action and a 
complex story line. Though it 
may be completely different from 
the books, the movie is far from 
being a horrible knockoff.

Saturday, Nov. 10

The only reason the first 
Fantastic Four did even semi-well 
in theaters is that all the other 
movies that summer were just 
as bad. This sequel, Rise of the 
Silver Surfer, is even worse. Im 
more entertained by Doug's 
Quailman and the Silver Skater 
 and thats a cartoon. As the 
Fantastic Four gears up to fight 
the Silver Surfer, the special 
effects may be amusing, but the 
movie is, in total, mind-numbingly 
ridiculous.

That creepy guy who lives down the 
hall has nothing on the neighbors in 
Rosemarys Baby. After moving into 
a sketchy new apartment building, 
Rosemary and Guy become 
suspicious that their new next-door 
neighbors are a little off. Rosemary 
gets pregnant after a weird dream, 
and everyone goes paranoid over 
the safety of the unborn child. A 
classic horror story in black and 
white, it will still freak everyone out 
(even the creepy guy down the hall) 
decades later.

International Festival: Thii
inequality
The group eventually decided to base each citys 
component of the exhibit on other students experiences 
studying abroad in different places. In the end, I think it 
was a lot better that we were able to have students provide 
their stories, Lee said.
One such story came from senior music technology major 
Mary Smith, who spent time in Kikuyu, Kenya. Drawing 
from Smiths experiences, the group used a picture she 
took of young students leaning over the carcass of a sheep 
that was to be divided among their entire school. After the 
sheep, which was donated by a farmer, arrived, the teachers 
had to cancel school for the rest of the day because the kids 
were too distracted by the promise of a small piece of meat.
Another story, of Soledad, Colombia, was taken from 
sophomore Nathan Frank, a double major in business and 
Hispanic studies. Frank took a picture of a dusty street 
separating several abandoned houses.  Soledad means 
lonely, and [Nathan] said it really was, Lee said.
The exhibit ran from Nov. 1 through Nov. 4.

Last weekend marked Carnegie Mellons 17th annual 
International Festival, "Global Exchange: Trade, Rights, and 
Welfare in a New World Economy. In addition to a variety 
of scheduled workshops, lectures, performances, and other 
events, there was also an exhibit in the UC Gallery called 
Life Inequality that compared cities around the world, from 
Pittsburgh to Kikuyu, Kenya.
In light of the International Festivals events, some of 
which were during class time on Friday and on Saturday 
morning, many students appreciated that the gallery was 
open throughout the festival. I thought it was really good 
that there was the gallery because my friends could just go 
at any time, said senior English major Justine Lee, who 
organized Life Inequality. Lee is an intern for Emily Half, the 
International Festival coordinator.
Life Inequality underwent a variety of stages. In the 
beginning we were really ambitious, said Lee, who 
worked with design students Ha-Jin Choi (a sophomore in 
communication design), Margaret Gerhart (a sophomore in 
industrial design), Youna Yang (a sophomore in industrial
- design), and Steven Lim (a junior in communication design). 
The group, which started work in September, originally 
planned to rely on online sources to research different cities, 
comparing specific facts such as average hourly wage. But 
statistics on uniform topics were hard to come by, and the 
group members worried that they would make the exhibit 
seem impersonal.

The price of low prices
Author of The Wal-Mart Effect speaks on campus
Charles Fishman, author of The Wal-Mait Effect, spoke on 
Friday as keynote speaker for the universitys 17th annual 
International Festival. The Wal-Mart Effect, a work critics 
have credited with revealing many aspects of contemporary 
globalization through an analysis of Wal-Mart's marketing 
strategies, is a national best seller and was named by The 
Economist one of the Best Books of 2006.
Choosing a keynote speaker for Carnegie Mellons 
International Festival involved long and careful thought, 
said Emily Half, the festivals coordinator. "We wanted to 
ensure that those attending could make up their own minds 
about the issues involved in globalization  to challenge 
participants, but also meet them where they stand," she 
said. With many Carnegie Mellon students enrolled in the 
Tepper School of Business and in engineering, computer 
science, and public policy programs, choosing a speaker 
who could analyze globalization from an angle relevant and 
potentially helpful to business and technology interests was 
important to Half and other International Festival committee 
members.
Fishman, a business journalist who is senior editor at the 
trade magazine Fast Company, began with a sobering 
analysis of what he calls the Wal-Mart effect. The 
corporation we know as Wal-Mart, explained Fishman, 
is more than just a name  and more than just a single, 
isolated business.
From its start as a small store in Bentonville, Ark., Wal-Mart 
has evolved into a massive transnational corporation. The 
company draws so many customers that it shapes, rather 
than follows, market forces. This tremendous influence, 
says Fishman, gives Wal-Marts decisions and policies a 
resonance and ripple effect outside the store walls. Indeed, 
there are no boundaries for the effect of Wal-Mart: Whether 
we shop there or not, says Fishman, we all exist in a WalMart ecosystem. "Even if you never shop at Wal-Mart, if you 
aggressively refuse to shop at Wal-Mart, the locally owned 
businesses you frequent consciously revolve in Wal-Marts 
orbit, and structure their business according to Wal-Marts 
activities," he said.
There are few checks on the power of Wal-Mart or the 
measures the company undertakes to get the low prices. 
Companies whose goods are sold at Wal-Mart have little 
choice but to submit to Wal-Marts requests to move 
production plants overseas in order to lower production 
costs. Additionally, Wal-Mart's demands often force 
producers to manufacture goods in conditions that violate 
numerous safety codes. Wal-Mart store managers in the 
U.S. and abroad, facing tremendous pressure to keep within 
a weekly budget, have compelled store employees to work 
off the clock (That phrase sounds so charming, doesn't it?" 
Fishman commented. But basically, theyre forced to work
for free), sometimes locking them in the store overnight. 
Naturally, Wal-Mart has made an effort to conceal these 
practices necessary to give Americans, and consumers 
everywhere, the irresistible combination of high-quality 
goods at the lowest possible prices.
Within this tremendous power to set the tempo and mode of 
production and consumption, Fishman sees great potential 
for positive change. As an example, Fishman cited WalMarts recent reforms in shrimp production, which has 
in the past destroyed wetlands and communities, as well 
as produced shrimp dangerously laden with chemical 
residue. Fishman says Wal-Mart has become interested in 
environmental sustainability due to public concern, and 
the positive changes they have made will set the standard 
forthe industry. Still, Fishman believes much responsibility 
for changing Wal-Marts behavior lies with the individual 
consumer.
Wal-Mart has the power in the global economy to raise 
standards, a power that even governments cannot 
command. The way this power shapes business is 
determined by consumers expressing their concern through 
their product selection. "The global economy is not a 
weather system. Its a reflection of our decisions as buyers, 
Fishman said. "The responsibility and leverage come from 
our wallets, so it's our job to shop in ways that alignthe 
global economy with our values.
Fishman does, however, admit that this is antithetical to our 
instinct to go for the deal: We want microwaves at $29.99, 
and we want the employees to be paid $20 an hour," he 
said: These things just dont go together." As privileged 
consumers, we have to look with clear vision at the manner 
of production, and the price exacted behind the temptingly 
low price tag  a shadow price that our globally connected 
community inevitably pays by sacrificing the rights of 
others.
Aspiring business students can learn from Wal-Mart's 
accomplishments and failures, Fishman said. He praised the 
company for its discipline, focus, and frugality, values that 
enabled Wal-Mart to form a covenant around low prices and 
stay relentlessly faithful to it, in the interests of customers. 
However, Fishman warned that unrelenting blind focus can 
be dangerous. "Remember, when youre heading out into 
business, that things change," he said. "Wal-Marts vision 
was appropriate in a certain place, when the company 
itself was a certain scale. A change in scale necessitates 
re-evaluation of your business practices, and staying true to 
your core mission cannot justify mistreatment of the rest of 
the world.

A Burgh full of Bhangra
Mayur-SASA and Chak De host Carnegie Mellons first Bhangra competition
Saturday night marked Carnegie Mellon's first dance 
competition, Bhangra in the 'Burgh, at the Soldiers & Sailors 
Auditorium in Oakland. The event was organized by members 
from the Mayur: South Asian Student Alliance and Chak De, 
Carnegie Mellon's Bhangra troupe.
"Its been a journey," said Pooja Godbole, the events committee 
president. "The idea had been floating around for quite some 
time. This year we finally had the manpower to do it. The 
committee has been planning the event since April.
Bhangra is one of the most lively and colorful folk dances of 
India. Traditionally, it was performed to celebrate the success 
of the harvest in Eastern Pakistan and the north Indian state of 
Punjab. Bhangra began as the dance of the farmers; today, it has 
grown into a popular form of dance performed on stages all over 
the world.'
Characterized by its distinct beats and its loud, energetic music, 
Bhangra creates an enjoyable performance. The dancers, decked 
in vibrant costumes of all different colors, are spectacular blurs 
as they dance across the stage, jumping to the beat. The lively 
dance steps are a mix of traditional Bhangra steps and modern 
dance techniques.
Bhangra in the Burgh featured 10 teams from all over the 
country, with Carnegie Mellons Chak De team performing last. 
Each team had its own flair and used different techniques to 
capture the audience. Some danced to a mix of Punjabi and 
Western music, while others created surprising formations 
by lifting each other into the air. Rutgers University Bhangra 
stood out, using live music sung by other members of the team. 
Perhaps for this reason, Rutgers wound up taking first place. 
Sonay Gabroo Punjab De (a group from Toronto) took second
place, and New York University Bhangra took third.
All of the performers wore traditional garb: The men wore lungis, 
pieces of cloth wrapped around their waist, and turbans to cover 
their heads, while the women wore ghagras, a traditional dress 
consisting of a long skirt, or a salwar kameez, a dress with pants 
underneath. Each team had a dhol player who beat a drum and 
provided a steady beat.
Bhangra in the Burgh included other acts to break up the 
competition, including a performance by The Originals, 
an all-male a cappella group on campus. Additionally, the 
show featured several non-competitive dance performances 
by Carnegie Mellons own dance troupes, including the 
International FreeStylers and Tanha, a South Asian fusion dance 
team. At other moments, comedian Rajiv Satyal entertained the 
audience with his stand-up comedy.
Besides being enjoyable, Bhangra in the Burgh was charitable 
as all of the proceeds from the show went to the Homeless 
Childrens Education Fund, which helps provide homeless 
children with equal education opportunities. We felt that this 
cause was most appropriate; being students ourselves, we 
wanted to help other children in Pittsburgh, Godbole said.
Bhangra in the 'Burgh aimed to promote Bhangra, attract 
dancers to the area, and, as Mayur-SASA President Dhruv 
Mathur said, put Pittsburgh on the map." Bhangra in the 'Burgh 
successfully achieved these goals, proving to be entertaining as 
well educational, and exposing new people to the energetic folk 
dance.

This week you will decide to wear your Busted Tees Mexican Basketball 
Association... 4th-Annual Juan-on-Juan Tournament T-shirt. Watch out 
for FMS workers carrying paint rollers. (Read the front page!)
The success of the Rent-A-Puppy event will inspire you to start Rent-AHobo day. The experience will be somewhat less fulfilling.
Dissatisfied with, both incumbent Ravenstahl and lackluster DeSantis, 
you will seek representation through a third party in the Pittsburgh 
mayoral race. I mean, how bad would socialism really be? Go universal 
health care!
You will go to the Broken Social Scene concert only to find, ironically 
and to your horror, that there are disemboweled hipsters everywhere.
Bhangra in the Burgh changed your fife. You will go to a wedding 
next week and be disappointed at the lack of super-awesome Punjabi 
wedding dancing.
Its cold now. I see a coat in your immediate future.
You thought MSTRKRFTs mad beats were oh-so-fresh at ABs 
Halloween party. Memories of the event will result in unexpected 
proclivity toward tight jeans and Chuck Taylors in coming weeks. Steer 
clear of Avalon... and your younger sisters closet.
Now that Family Weekend is over and your parents are safely home, 
you wont have another decent meal until Thanksgiving. Thats no joke 
here.
You will begin dating on Thursday, but you will not begin buying 
condoms until next week. You will drop out of school in July.
You dont see whats so special about the Kid Nation phenomenon. 
I mean, your fraternity has been having water-balloon fights and 
meaningless arguments for years. 
Next week you will go to Health Services for nausea and be indignant 
when the nurse asks you if you are pregnant. But this time, you actually 
will be pregnant.
Next week your mother will call you and ask you why you arent having 
more fun, why you seem so stressed out, and why you dont date more 
often. To her horror, she will realize she did not send you to Central 
Michigan University.

you go to bed last

ISIVE UP!
What possessed you to 
puii that all-nighter?
FRIENDS DONT LET SLEEP-DEPRIVED FRIENDS WATCH

*THEN AGAIN. IF YOU'VE NEVER WATCHED A KOREAN SOAP, YOU SHOULD. !T IS WORTH IT.
