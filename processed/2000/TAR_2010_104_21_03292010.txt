Students to vote on newly introduced 
referendum for student government stipends
JACKSON LANE
Staffwriter
A student-wide referen
dum regarding the potential 
payment of a yearly stipend 
to Carnegie Mellons student 
government executives is on 
the ballot next week, appear
ing as a secondary issue in this 
years upcoming student gov
ernment elections.
Senior political science and 
international relations major 
Rotimi Abimbola, who cur
rently serves as student body 
president, is putting forth the 
referendum. Im either in 
class or at a meeting, which is
what your schedule is like as 
president. When you do have 
free time, people always ping 
you and ask you to come to 
meetings or make decisions 
... so the to-do list is really just 
endless, Abimbola said. Af
ter a lot of hard work and in
vesting a lot of time and effort 
into the position ... I began 
to realize that I needed some 
type of income.
Both Timi and I pay for 
our own living expenses, and 
we had jobs prior to this year. 
Timi was an RA, and I worked 
10 to 15 hours a week for 
the civil engineering depart
ment, said senior commu
nications design major and 
Student Body Vice President 
of Finance Nara Kasbergen. 
Timi no longer has a job, and 
Ive kept my job with civil en
gineering, but only because
I schedule my own hours.... 
Not to sound melodramatic, 
but weve both really strug
gled to make ends meet this 
year. Weve been willing to 
make the sacrifice because we 
feel like the students and our 
initiatives are worth it, but re
ally, no one should be going 
hungry or struggling to get by 
because they want to do a ser
vice to the student body.
I guess I wouldnt really
call it compensation as much 
as a living wage.
Executives stress that it is 
important to note that none 
of the current student gov
ernment executives, includ
ing Abimbola and Kasbergen, 
would financially benefit from 
the proposed stipends. Sti
pends would be paid out at the 
earliest in fall 2010 to the new 
student body president and 
vice presidents. It would be a 
disservice to the student body 
if the right candidate for a po
sition decided they were un
able to run because they just

Candidate Robert Piston withdraws 
from SBVPF race
Student body vice president of finance candidate Robert Piston 
announced that he will no longer be running in this weeks election.
PATRICK GAGE KELLEY
Contributing Editor
I really want to make JFC 
something people are proud 
to be on, Robert Piston said 
as he withdrew his candidacy 
for student body vice presi
dent of finance.
After deliberation, Piston 
decided to withdraw his can
didacy because he believed 
someone who can put a lot 
of time into the position de
serves it, and since he had 
been recently accepted into 
the CIT Honors Research 
program, he wasnt sure if he 
had the flexibility anymore. 
I received the letter that I 
was a candidate for honors 
research after I submitted my 
SBVPF petition. I have been 
very carefully considering 
this decision, he said.
CMU is such a great re
search institution. It is so 
highly reputable, and so re
vered for its research. And 
just the fact that they allow 
undergraduates to partici
pate in this is a unique op
portunity, Piston said. With 
Piston considering graduate 
school, he felt this research 
would be an important step,
and he would not continue in 
the election.
Piston stressed that, al
though he has withdrawn his 
candidancy, he still deeply 
cares about the JFC and 
hopes that it can continue to 
refine its internal processes, 
much like Undergraduate 
Student Senate did this year. 
He spoke directly about ju
nior information systems and 
policy and management ma
jor Aaron Gross leadership as 
Senate chair, applauding his 
use of quantitative analysis: 
He analyzed what was going 
well, and not, through simple 
things: Google forms, ques
tionnaires, compiling data, 
and figuring out peoples 
expectations, Piston said, 
emphasizing that this was 
something he would really 
like to see happen with JFC, 
and student organizations 
and their treasurers.
And while Piston said, I 
firmly believe both are very 
qualified candidates, he is 
now endorsing Eric Wu for 
SBVPF. According to Piston, 
[Wu] is very dedicated to his 
work ... and I feel confident 
that his experience ... would 
serve him the best.

lOOOplus day encourages student service
ERIN BURNS
Junior Staffwriter
lOOOplus, an annual Carn
egie Mellon day of community 
service, brought together over 
1000 students to spend last 
Saturday engaged in service 
activities across Pittsburgh. 
1000 Plus is in its third year of 
operation and for the past two 
has partnered with Pittsburgh 
Cares, a local nonprofit aimed 
at increasing community volunteerism.
Throughout the day, groups 
of students were shuttled to 
locations across the city where 
they participated in a variety 
of service activities, including 
adult education and literacy, 
disaster relief, homelessness 
and hunger eradication, and 
environmental protection and 
preservation. Students unable 
to dedicate the necessary four 
hours for the off-campus on
site projects were able to assist 
with in-house projects. These 
included making senior Jeop
ardy games and literacy bingo 
for schools.
 Jonathan Kroll, the for

lOOOplus is currently run by 
a student board and has been 
sponsored by the coordinator 
of Student Development, Lu

years.
While the events title 
stems from the aim of organiz

under 600 students registered 
in 2008. This year is the first
to boast a registration over 
1000.
Christian accredited this to

and playwrights in the School 
of Drama collaborate on more 
than 40 student-run produc
tions to produce Playground: 
A Festival of Independent 
Student Work.
The festival, which com

past week, offers student ac
tors and producers the op
portunity to create their own 
productions outside of nor
mal classroom requirements 
and guidelines. One weeks 
worth of rehearsals and prep
arations culminated in per
formances and events staged 
throughout campus.
The events varied across 
disciplines represented with

robot called Dragon Run
ner  has been named the 
worlds most durable- robot, 
according to the collabora
tors creating the 2010 edition 
of the Guinness Book of World 
Records.
Dragon Runner is a small 
robot that can be used for 
surveillance in urban areas. 
The rugged robot has four 
wheels and is 15 inches long, 
less than a foot wide, and five 
inches in height. At only nine 
pounds, it is light enough to 
be carried in a backpack or 
thrown. It is also able to be 
powered by military batter
ies, making it ideal for areas 
with little to no electricity.
Dragon Runner is being 
tested in Iraq, acting as the
eyes for U.S. Marines, as it 
can see around corners and 
deliver real-time imagery.
Dragon Runner was de
veloped by Hagen Schempf, 
head systems scientist at Car
negie Mellons Robotics Insti
tute. Twelve early examples 
of Dragon Runner, built by 
Carnegie Mellon spin-off Automatika Inc., were delivered 
to the Marines in 2004. To
day, several models of Drag
on Runner are now produced 
commercially by QinetiQ.

SBVPF election down to two candidates
Shanel Buchanan and Eric Wu compete for student votesAaron Gross runs to become first SBVPO
SABRINA PORTER
Contributing Editor
Shanel Buchanan, junior 
biology and psychology major, 
hopes to address the issues of 
transparency within the Joint 
Funding Committee (JFC).
My campaign offers a 
fresh perspective based on old 
values, Buchanan said.
Buchanan feels that the 
image of the JFC is in need of 
change, as many in the stu
dent body are uninformed 
about how the JFC functions 
in the context of Student 
Government as a whole. She 
wants students to understand 
the process and to see that 
they have a large part in what 
the JFC does. She sees this as 
coming hand-in-hand with 
better partnerships with the 
Committee on Student Orga
nizations, Undergraduate Stu
dent Senate, and the Graduate 
Student Assembly.
In addition to currently 
serving on the JFC, Buchan
ans involvement on campus 
through organizations such 
as National Society of Black 
Engineers, Womens Leader
ship Institute, and Emergency 
Medical Services has allowed 
her to see the organizational
Celia ludwinski/Photo Editor
side of the process.
JFC should not be thought 
of as just cutting budgets, but 
more like making helpful sug
gestions, Buchanan said of 
the the JFCs image among 
student groups.
In terms of consistency, 
Buchanan wants to show that 
the JFC can be consistent with 
each organization every year. 
She saw inconsistencies with
in the JFCs yearly funding 
when she served as treasurer 
of a student organization for 
the past two years.
Buchanan also wants to 
hold organizations more fis
cally accountable for their 
budgets.
Buchanan mentioned ad
ditional ideas, such as con
tinuing where current Stu
dent Body Vice President of 
Finance Nara Kasbergen left 
off in terms of improving the 
JFC relationship with student 
organizations and expanding 
the role of the representative 
to serve as a mentor who can 
help with queries, such as 
how to contact AB Tech about 
showing a movie. Buchanan 
hopes that all of these initia
tives will also aid in improv
ing the visibility of the JFC 
throughout campus.
Eric Wu may be the first 
computer science major to run 
for a position in the student 
government executive branch 
in recent years.
His plans are centered on 
expanding the role of SBVPF 
beyond the JFC, helping the 
elected student to become a 
campus educator for students 
on the financial situation of 
the university, as well as pro
moting careful spending for 
student organizations.
Everyone just associates 
VPF with JFC, Wu said. But 
theres so much more to it.
Wu hopes to plan fall meet
ings of the JFC at which the 
members look not just at stu
dent organization budgets but 
at other financial issues faced 
by the university.
Wu mentioned issues such 
as finding ways to communi
cate the universitys economic 
situation to students, as well 
as assisting with his proposed 
Economies of Scale initiative. 
Economies of Scale would 
promote, for example, the pur
chase of a projector that could 
be rented out to organizations 
at a nominal fee less than 
the current $100 necessary 
for renting university projec
tors. The initiative could also
uena LuawinsKi/^noto taitor
include things such as mass 
purchases of wood for organi
zations during Carnival.
Wu also aims to work with 
David Ruvolo and the Office 
of Student Activities to better 
train the JFC representatives. 
He spoke highly of what Kas
bergen has already done in di
versifying the JFC, as this fa
miliarizes the JFC with more 
of the organizations.
Wu has been heavily in
volved on campus and cited 
his experiences as one of his 
major qualifications. In Stu
dent Senate, he served as chair 
of the Internal Development 
Committee and was heavily 
involved in the Healthy Cam
pus 2010 designated smoking 
area plan. He also has worked 
with Housing and Dining in 
changing vendors to Parkhurst 
and with other programmers 
in developing CMU Portal at 
cmuevent.org. Wu has worked 
with other student-based or
ganizations such as Aware
ness of Roots in Chinese Cul
ture, and he has also served as 
a first-year mentor in Mudge 
House.
Ive always been interest
ed in finance, Wu said, and I 
really want to help further my 
peers and the university.

Aaron Gross, a junior in
formation systems and policy 
and management major, is 
the only candidate to run for 
this newly added student gov
ernment executive position. 
Gross has a long history of 
student organization leader
ship including time as an Ori
entation counselor and the 
president of ScotchnSoda. 
He is also the current chair of 
the Undergraduate Student 
Senate.
I want to be an advocate 
for helping organizations do 
the best work they can do, 
Gross said. And I want to 
make sure that they are ap
preciated.
Grosss Media Screens ini
tiative proposes the addition 
of TV screens, similar to the 
one in Kirr Commons in the 
UC, to be placed throughout 
campus to be used for orga
nization advertisement and 
events. Gross has spoken with 
peer institution Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute, whose 
open-source technology for 
such TVs could be adapted to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Beyond promoting orga
nizations on campus, Gross 
wants to learn more about 
the current student activity
experience. His Data Collect
ing initiative includes con
ducting a survey of students 
regarding the effectiveness 
of the Activities Fair and a 
financial analysis of current 
Student Activities processes 
such as reimbursements.
Gross small grant pro
gram would reward organi
zations that collaborate with 
one another and allow for 
combination of funding.
The organizations are al
ready strong. Where the VPO 
comes in is clearing the road
blocks, Gross said.
Gross cited roadblocks 
such as reimbursement 
time and lack of office and 
rehearsal space, for which 
he described a solution: ap
proaching the Board of Trust
ees and discussing a place in 
the universitys Master Plan, 
a plan developed by the uni
versity for approximately 
20 years of campus growth, 
approved by the city of Pitts
burgh and most recently up
dated in 2002.
If elected, Gross plans on 
meeting individually with ev
ery student organization on 
campus to better assess their 
needs, beginning as soon as 
this current spring semester.

SafeWalk encourages student safety
Courtney Wittekind/News Editor
SafeWalk offers late-night escorts, while also making service 
opportunities available to students and on-campus organizations.
Referendum proposes student government executive stipend
STIPENDS, from Al
COURTNEY WinEKIND
News Editor
Carnegie Mellons Safe
Walk is an independent, stu
dent-run organization that 
offers escorts to students, 
faculty, and staff walking 
through campus during latenight hours. The organiza
tions mission states that the 
group hopes to minimize 
exposure of the Carnegie Mel
lon community to crime risks, 
to deter criminals, and to pro
mote an enhanced feeling of 
personal safety.
Any students traveling late 
at night can request an escort 
at any time from 10 p.m. to
2 a.m. Students can contact 
SafeWalk by calling the orga
nizations dispatcher at (412) 
268-SAFE, or by approach
ing any member of the escort 
team that is not responding 
to a call. SafeWalk will escort 
students between on-campus 
locations or throughout Oak
land, including Webster Hall, 
Fairfax Apartments, Cathe
dral Mansions, London Ter
race, Shirley Apartments, 
Shady Oak Apartments, and 
Veronica Apartments.
Current SafeWalk presi
dent and junior engineering 
and public policy and me
chanical engineering major 
Ben Streeter became involved 
in SafeWalk during his first 
year at Carnegie Mellon, 
quickly joining the executive 
board with the hope of con
tinuing to increase SafeWalks 
visibility among students.
I became involved with 
the executive board after only 
three or four shifts because I 
was reading through the or
ganizations manual and saw 
a few things that could have 
used a little improvement, 
Streeter said.
Since Streeter joined the 
executive board almost three 
years ago, SafeWalks service 
has seen a definite growth in 
usage. When I first joined the 
program, the service wasnt
used very much. I think we got 
around 12 calls a semester. It 
is steadily growing  with 
each semester we get more 
and more requests for es
corts, Streeter said. Today 
we are up to a call volume of 
two or three calls a week. But, 
then again, one night last se
mester I received three calls 
in one night, so it is definitely 
continuing to grow.
Ashish Babaria, a junior 
mathematical sciences major 
who is now on the SafeWalk 
executive board, became in
volved with SafeWalk after 
hearing about the groups 
mission. I feel as if safety is 
one of those things which is 
often overlooked by students 
during the late hours of the 
night.... I wanted to spread 
the word about SafeWalk, so 
that students realize how im
portant their safety is.
In addition to offering stu
dents a number to call when 
they are in need of an escort, 
SafeWalk also gives many stu
dents a unique option for pro
viding a public service to the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
While SafeWalk has al
ways accepted student volun
teers and now boasts a mem
bership of over 50 individual 
volunteers, the organization
recently created an Adopta-Day program that allows 
student groups to become in
volved as well. Adopt-a-Day 
allows student organizations 
the opportunity to sign up 
to provide volunteers during 
SafeWalks 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
shift one day each week. Cur
rently four student organiza
tions have adopted days to 
help out with SafeWalks eve
ning shifts, including three 
fraternities.
Stephanie Kao, a sopho
more mathematical sciences 
major and a third SafeWalk 
executive board member, 
stressed the necessity of such 
an organization on campus 
and simultaneously the need 
for a strong group of volun
teers.
In a couple months, 
we had more calls than we 
had all last year. So this re
ally prompts us to ensure that 
SafeWalk is a reliable option 
for people when they are con
sidering their safety on cam
pus, Kao said.
Any student interested in 
volunteering with SafeWalk, 
or any student organization

couldnt afford not to have a 
part-time job on the side, and 
the many hours required by 
holding such a position make 
it impossible to have a job, 
Kasbergen said.
Currently, the student gov
ernment is considering using 
either an outside donor or the 
student activities fee to fund 
stipends, and there are strong 
arguments on both sides. 
Many Carnegie Mellon stu
dents have expressed a strong 
reaction to learning that they 
would be in part paying one 
of their peers living expenses, 
but that type of awareness is 
actually a part of what some 
are hoping to achieve with 
stipends.
In the past, many in the 
student body have felt that 
student government is just 
a bunch of people who love 
titles and dont do anything, 
Abimbola said. Most of the 
Senators [in Undergraduate 
Student Senate] thought sti
pends should come out of the 
student activities fee so there 
is some sense of accountabil
ity to your constituents.
Junior general humanities 
and social sciences major Jarrett Adams is one of the Sena
tors who believes in drawing 
stipends from the student 
activities fee, even as he en
ters the race for student body 
president. I believe that stu
dent government executives, 
if given a stipend, should be 
given one through the student 
activities fee because then it 
holds them accountable to 
the student body, not to the 
administration, he said. To 
be paid out of an alumni en
dowment that is only vaguely 
related to student government 
could be a conflict of interest 
for student body representa
tives and their relationship 
with both the administration 
and the interests of alumni.
Students should be able to 
hold their representatives 
accountable, and executive 
pay needs to ensure that hap
pens.
However, there are also 
many who believe that an 
outside donor should pay 
the stipends, despite the loss 
of accountability. While it 
makes good sense that our 
constituents should support 
us, I believe that, if possible, 
we should be paid through 
funding from an outside do
nor, said sophomore busi
ness administration major 
Eric Wu, who is running for 
student body vice president of 
finance. Given the nature of 
our university, very few of our 
constituents understand the 
time and dedication required 
to excel in such a position.
Besides worries about 
backlash from the student 
body, there are also many 
financial concerns about 
whether the student activities 
fee provides enough money to 
support stipends. The Joint 
Funding Committee already 
has a hard time cutting down 
budgets with the pool that is 
allocated to us from the stu
dent activities fee, Wu said.
Everyone wants to be 
careful about how we are al
lotting our money and wheth
er or not this is the right tim
ing for [us] to start spending 
more in the middle of an eco
nomic downtown, said ju
nior business administration 
major Michael Surh, who is 
also running for student body 
president. Carnegie Mellon is 
an awesome school, and there 
are a lot of programs here that 
could use extra funding. We 
need to make sure that every 
single student here gets the 
full experience, because that 
is what student government is 
here to do.
Were facing crunches 
in departments, were feeing 
crunches in funding, and we
want to make sure that the 
student activities fee money 
goes more towards the school 
as whole than to the student 
government that is running 
it, echoed junior business 
administration major Micah 
Rosa, who is running for stu
dent body vice president with 
Surh. As of now, there are 
more responsible ways to use 
the limited funds we have.
On the other hand, pay
ing stipends through a donor 
also has its advantages. If it 
came from a donor, it would 
be an endowed position, so 
we would not have to worry 
about the donor stopping 
funds five years from now, 
explained Abimbola.
However, to many, hold
ing a position within student 
government is considered 
worthwhile without pay. We 
should be content with our 
positions and with the satis
faction we get from our posi
tions. We get power, we get 
influence, we get respect, and 
we get a strong rsum6 build
er, Rosa said.
Some in student govern
ment, including junior art 
major Casey Brander, who 
is running for student body 
president with junior BCSA 
major Matt Sandler, see the 
referendum as a simple eco
nomic transaction. My an
swer to all questions is: Get 
money, get paid.
But for now, Abimbola and 
the rest of the student govern
ment executives and Under
graduate Student Senate are 
waiting to see how students 
vote on the referendum in the 
coming election. I personally 
would not feel comfortable 
putting forth this type of leg
islation without first tapping 
into student opinion, Surh 
said.

role as Greek life intern, lead
ership in Kappa Alpha Theta, 
involvement in lOOOplus, and 
former membership on the 
varsity soccer team.
The pair has a series of 
initiatives aimed at enhanc
ing the student experience, 
from a CollegeConnect pro
gram featuring inter-college 
socials and college-based 
lecture programs to an in
crease in transparency and 
communication achieved by 
meeting with student leaders 
from such organizations as 
the Student Dormitory Coun
cil and the Greek governing 
bodies on a regular basis.
The Campus Life and Uni
ty initiative aims to encour
age students to get involved 
as early as possible. The plan 
hopes to motivate students to 
get involved as soon as Orien
tation is over, assuming that 
the Orientation spirit will 
carry through. The pair ex
pressed an interest in working with the Orientation staff 
and serving as a resource and 
added perspective for them.
We want to support stu
dents in every way that we 
can to make their college ex
perience the best it could pos
sibly be, Smith said.
Adams and Smith spoke 
of the importance of looking 
at all the aspects that shape 
a students experience. Their 
Executive Grant Program 
would investigate endeav
ors such as adding electrical 
outlets to the Cut for student 
laptops, while the Great Ideas 
campaign would encourage 
the development of more stu
dent ideas.
If students feel like they 
cant complain to us, were 
not doing a good job, Adams 
said.
Seriously, give us as 
many [problems] as possible. 
We want to try and fix them, 
Smith added.

They are passionate about 
getting a lot more active off 
campus through expanding 
such events as lOOOplus, en
forcing the designated smok
ing area policy, increasing 
dining selection, and putting 
added focus on sustainabil

While doing their signa
ture Z-snap move, the two 
spoke about their get-it-done 
personalities.
Were all about creative 
solutions, Brander said.
The two have been in
volved in a variety of cam

is passionate about her artwork while pursuing multiple 
outside projects, and was re
sponsible for bringing Rever
end Billy to campus as an AB 
speaker.
Sandler is currently the AB 
Comedy chair, is the former 
Comics editor at The Tartan, 
and has a great interest in ro
botics.
The two engaged in banter 
about the patriarchal label

of robotics, and the main slo
gan for their campaign, while 
showing their complementa

extra money while also serv
ing the Pittsburgh communi

tized database in which local 
businesses could list odd jobs 
they need done, such as de
signing a webpage or making 
an advertisement.
Surh and Rosa have a his
tory of student involvement 
on campus, particularly in 
entrepreneurship start-ups, 
many of which are relevant 
to their initiatives and which 
they say gives their campaign 
something extra, since they 
have experience in already 
implementing all that they 
are proposing.
Their Active Communica
tion Program would include a 
weekly column in The Tartan 
as well as an opt-in/opt-out 
e-mail newsletter to familiar
ize students and groups with 
the happenings of student 
government.
In order to centralize the 
club community, the CMU 
Central initiative would build 
off the existing CMU Portal in 
listing all clubs, leaders, web
sites, and events in one place 
with the ability of categoriza
tion by club type, as well as a 
built-in website template for 
any student organization to 
use and modify for its own 
purposes. They already have 
a limited CMU Portal up and 
running.
To unite Carnegie Mellons 
diverse clubs and interests, 
Rosa and Surh propose re
directing the existing Tartan 
Rewards programs to student 
organization events, provid
ing rewards both for students 
with high attendance as well 
as the organizations who put 
on the events for the commu
nity.
We cant force you to be 
proud, Surh said. We want 
you to have every reason to 
be proud of this school.
Students give back at 
lOOOplus service day
, ............................. Devin Beahm/Photo StafflOOOplus teamed up with Pittsburgh Cares, a local service
organization, to offer students volunteer activities for the day.
SERVICE, from A1
Alexa New, the Pittsburgh 
Cares program manager for 
Business Cares and Cam
pus Cares, has worked with 
lOOOplus for the entirety of 
the partnership. She also 
works with other Carnegie 
Mellon service organizations 
throughout the year. CMU 
students are really unique. 
They are the best student 
leaders. They get their peers 
involved and really take own
ership of the projects. 
Thom Dawkins, a Pitts
burgh Cares volunteer, agreed 
with News assessment. Ive 
never seen a university where 
students are so proactive.
Cindy Wang, a sophomore 
business administration ma
jor and member of the stu
dent board, also discussed the 
unique aspects of lOOOplus 
among service events. It 
reaches across campus and 
involves everyone at CMU: 
students, alumni, staff, as 
well as members of the Pitts
burgh community.
Christian articulated a de
sire for an even greater scope. 
The hope is that lOOOplus 
can be more than just one 
day of service, that it can be 
a group of students organiz
ing service all year round. 
To this end, lOOOplus creat
ed posters staked across the 
Cut for MLK Day, a national 
day of service, with statistics 
about the amount of service 
completed by students.
lOOOplus also partnered 
with student organizations 
across campus, and Christian 
cited the Greek organizations 
as being especially involved. 
Kate Smith, a junior social 
and decision science major 
and lOOOplus student board 
member, is a member of Kap
pa Alpha Theta and credits 
the service hours required 
by Greek life as a reason for 
pledging.
This year alone, Carn
egie Mellon students, fac
ulty, and staff volunteered 
around 117,500 hours. Dur
ing lOOOplus, over 4000 
hours were volunteered, rep
resenting an contribution to 
Pittsburgh of about $80,000 
worth of work hours.
Christian summed up this 
effort, explaining that the 
culture of service is already 
here on campus.... I think it 
is really cool that even with 
a very academically rigorous 
curriculum, students still find 
time for what theyre passion
ate about, and one of those 
things is service. We want to 
help foster that.

Windshield helps drivers see through fog
ABHINAV PARAMESHWAR
Junior Staffwriter
Fog that tends to con
ceal the driveway during the 
early hours will no longer be 
a major problem for drivers 
after General Motors R&D 
announced the development 
of technology that turns the 
entire windshield into an elec
tronic display.
Few heads-up-display 
(HUD) projects make it past 
the prototype stage, in spite 
of their clear benefits. General
Motors is trying to change that 
by working in tandem with 
Carnegie Mellon and the Uni
versity of Southern California 
in order to devise one of the 
most advanced HUD systems 
the automotive industry has 
seen.
Scientists and lab techni
cians at GMs global research 
and development in Warren, 
Mich., are trying to develop a 
system that gathers informa
tion through a variety of builtin sensors and cameras.
According to a GM Media
press release, the device can 
project images onto the sur
face of a windshield. Were 
looking to create enhanced 
vision systems, said Thomas 
Seder, the projects lab man
ager at GM R&D. The innova
tive technology involves utiliz
ing compact ultraviolet lasers 
that take information in from 
the vehicles surroundings 
and process it rapidly.
Enhanced vision systems 
utilize lasers to highlight road 
edges, speed limit signs, and 
other such vital bits of infor
mation for drivers during fogfilled commutes.
Since the surface of the 
windshield is wide, the sys
tem is able to alert drivers of 
potential dangers that exist ei
ther outside the drivers field 
of vision or in a blind spot.
Common hazards, such as 
small children and motorcy
clists that often go unnoticed, 
can more easily be seen by 
drivers.

Addictions: Stuck in 
a dangerous cycle
BRIAN LEE
SciTech Editor
Many people have daily 
habits and nervous tics. Some 
people bite their nails; oth
ers crack their knuckles. But 
when dangerous habits be
come compulsive or even an 
obsession, it may be a sign of 
an addiction.
Addictions can take many 
forms, although scientifically 
they only represent behaviors 
that will harm an organism if 
not stopped.
However, in everyday 
terms, addiction can present 
itself as any sort of compul
sive behavior.
Probably one of the most 
common addictions today is 
smoking. According to www. 
alternet.org, one-fifth of the 
worlds population, or 1.2 bil
lion people, are smokers.

QW..TH1NGS WORK
Algae quantum mechanics: Complex processes by a simple organism
ZACHARIAS GEORGE
Staffwriter
For nearly 150 years, physi
cists around the world have 
been trying to work out the in
tricate details of various quan
tum mechanical phenomena. 
More recently, much thought 
has gone into making quan
tum computing possible  a 
move seen by many as essen
tial for the world of computing 
to truly progress. In the race 
to come up with quantum me
chanics-based devices, physi
cists lost to algae. According to 
Greg Scholes, lead author of a 
study published in Nature, al
gae have been using quantum 
mechanical processes to per
form photosynthesis for over 2 
billion years.
As is well known, plants 
convert light energy into the 
plant equivalent of food, ad
enosine triphosphate (ATP), 
in a process called photosyn
thesis. Plants perform photo
synthesis by harnessing light 
energy to react carbon dioxide 
with other simple compounds 
to make more complicated sug
ars for later use. During photo
synthesis, light is absorbed by 
organelles inside of the plant
cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a number of 
photosynthetic reaction cen
ters where the complex sugars 
are generated with the help of 
light-capturing pigment called 
chlorophyll. This pigment 
gives plants their green color.
This model adequately ex
plained photosynthesis for 
decades. However, scientists 
have suspected the use of 
quantum mechanics at some 
point during this process, as 
the process seems uncannily 
efficient with the harnessing 
and usage of light. Until early 
this year, this idea was wide
ly publicized, but with little 
proof or understanding of the 
role of quantum mechanics in 
the process. To provide some 
hard scientific proof, scientists 
at the University of Toronto 
conducted a battery of tests on 
a common algae called cryptophytes, and they have shown 
that the algae do indefed uti
lize quantum mechanical phe
nomena to help improve the 
efficiency of photosynthesis.
The study highlighted 
the role of certain proteins 
referred to as antennae. An
tennae intercept incoming 
photons and redirect them to
the photosynthetic reaction 
centers, performing a func
tion that puzzled scientists 
for years, as it seemed redun
dant. The reaction centers 
are fully capable of receiving 
light themselves without any 
assistance. It is this apparent 
redundancy that aroused such 
ihterest in the antenna pro
teins. The team led by Scholes 
fired low-power laser light in 
very, short bursts at the algal 
cells and studied the electron 
transmission patterns using a 
second laser.
Under normal circumstanc
es, energetic photons transfer 
their energy to electrons in 
atoms. These electrons then 
vibrate at a frequency related 
to the amount of energy im
parted to them. With time, 
however, these vibrations at
tenuate, or lose intensity, and 
the electrons return to their 
initial states of lower energy. 
Scholes team noticed that, 
in the algal cells, the excited 
electrons remained in a state 
of higher energy for a period 
20 times longer than normally 
possible. This is due to a quan
tum mechanical phenomenon 
known as quantum coher
ence.
Quantum coherence was 
discovered while conducting 
an experiment called Youngs 
double-slit experiment, using 
electrons instead of light. The 
experiment involves passing a 
stream of electrons through a 
screen with two parallel slits 
in it. When the electrons hit 
a target on the other side of 
the screen, the result is an in
terference pattern similar to 
that obtained by passing light 
waves through the slits. ,
This means that, unlike pre
viously believed, once within 
the cell, light is transmitted 
not as photons but as waves. 
This also means that photons 
(or any particle small enough) 
are capable of doing things 
that might seem unreal. One 
example of this is a possible 
reason Scholes has proposed 
this mechanism. He believes it 
may be possible for every pho
ton to decide which path to the 
reaction center is the most en
ergy efficient and travel to the 
target via that particular best 
path. That vibrating electron 
could put some feelers out and 
see which path to take, Sc
holes said. This ensures light 
travels from the antenna to the 
reaction center without any
loss of energy, improving the 
efficiency of photosynthesis.
This study shows the pos
sibility of quantum phenom
ena occurring at room tem
perature in biological systems.

Photosynthesis in algae rely on principles of quantum mechanics, using 
proteins called antennae. These redirect photons to take the most 
efficient path, allowing the most energy to be extracted from the photons.
SCITECH BRIEFS
Semiconducting ink makes RFID tags Artificial mother-of-pearl produced
Researchers at Sunchon National University in South Korea 
and at Rice University in Houston have developed a way to make 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags significantly less ex
pensive. These tags are already used in many applications as a 
substitute for barcodes, since it is much easier to scan them by 
simply pointing a scanner in their general direction. However, 
conventional tags are not used for disposable items since they 
are made using expensive silicon and cost 50 cents per tag.
The new discovery uses paper and semiconducting ink to 
bring the cost down to as Jittle as three cents per tag. The ulti
mate goal is one cent. The ink is made up of carbon nariotubes, 
which play the part of silicon in the tag.
RFID tags may eliminate lines at the supermarket, said James 
M. Tour of Rice University. He noted that you could run your 
cart by a detector and it tells you instantly whats in the cart.
Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is a unique substance. It is flame
proof, flexible, and strong. However, it hard to come by and is 
sourced primarily from shellfish. Previous attempts at creating 
it artificially required a great deal of labor to create even a small 
amount.
Scientists at the Helsinki University of Technology have de
veloped a method of combining hard clay particles and soft 
synthetic polymer to produce thin, foot-long sheets of motherof-pearl in minutes. While there remains some work to be done 
to remove impurities and improve toughness, the material is al
ready extremely heat resistant. Its creators envision it being used 
as a cheap way to fireproof buildings and as a component in the 
protective armor used by soldiers and police officers. Its ability 
to block oxygen also makes it useful to manufacturers of elec
tronics as a protective casing for sensitive electronics.
Revolutionary boat hopes to circle globe
Frenchman Alain Thebault, captain of the Hydroptere, hopes 
to halve Phileas Foggs circumnavigation time and simultane
ously break the world record of circumnavigating the world in a 
sailboat. His boat is similar to a hydrofoil in that it actually flies 
a few meters above the water with only small wings present 
below the water to anchor the boat.
The fact that only a small fraction of the boat is actually im
mersed in the water reduces drag and allows the boat to reach 
speeds of 70 miles an hour. The boat will be powered by wind 
alone/
While the plan is risky, Thebault plans to build a larger ver
sion of his boat, to be called the Hydroptere Maxi, that he believes 
will be able to handle the difficulties of an ocean crossing. While 
the Maxi, will be ready by 2013, he has another goal closer at 
hand: He wants to cross the Pacific Ocean in three days in 2011.

WINDSHIELD, from A6
windshield could make driv
ing easier and safer. Night vi
sion will be greatly enhanced, 
and general navigation will be 
made easier due in large part 
to the camera-based sensors 
that will improve visibility 
and object detection ability.
The windshield is layered 
with transparent phosphors 
that emit visible light when 
stimulated by light from the 
compact laser. As specified 
by www.autoevolution.com, 
the windshield acts as a large 
transparent display as op
posed to current HUD systems 
that use only a small section 
of the windshield.
The technology improves
on other HUD screens that GM 
first launched back in 1988. 
The deliberate design helps 
focus the drivers attention on 
the road ahead by displaying 
important information such 
as speed and warning mes
sages directly in front of the 
drivers line of vision.
Since drivers do not need 
to angle their heads down to 
see instruments at a lower 
level, driving while checking 
for hazardous conditions is 
made easier.
Thats so awesome! said 
first year-CIT student Vishal 
Jeet when he heard about 
GMs project. This sounds 
like its straight out of one 
of those sci-fi movies or one 
of those jet fighter games. If
nothing else, it makes driving 
more interesting. '
There are those, however, 
who feel like HUD systems 
can cause problems for the 
driver. I cant imagine how 
colorful images on the wind
shield will not be a distraction 
and cover the drivers vision, 
said first-year CIT student 
Raghav Behl.
I just cant see how useful 
this actually is. If anything, it 
will just make drivers depen
dent on the system to detect 
all hazards, Behl said.
Although the technology 
has not yet been assigned to 
a GM vehicle program, Seder 
has stated that it could end 
up in cars in the foreseeable 
future.

Besides scanning road outlines, the windshield can read certain signs, such as posted speed limits, and alert

ADDICTION, from A6
of the Solanaceae family, of 
which tobacco is a member.
In our body, only a few 
chemicals can cross the bloodbrain barrier, which is the 
physical separation between 
the bloodstream and the brain 
involving capillary walls.
For example, oxygen mole
cules and hormones can cross 
this barrier. Nicotine can also 
pass into the brain, and it is in 
the brain that it binds to and 
activates cell receptors.
Cell receptors are present 
on the surface of cells, and 
when certain molecules at
tach to them, they affect neu
rotransmitter production.
Nicotine causes cells to 
release more neurotransmit
ters such as dopamine, which 
cause feelings of relaxation 
and euphoria.
Nicotine can also activate 
receptors in other parts of the 
body, causing the release of 
chemicals such as epineph
rine and endorphins.
Some of these chemicals 
are naturally associated with 
reduced feelings of pain and 
increased alertness.
However, other chemicals 
in cigarette smoke are known 
carcinogens, substances that 
cause cancer.
Addiction to other drugs, 
such as cocaine or heroin, 
works similarly to nicotine. 
They artificially increase the 
levels of certain chemicals in 
the body that cause feelings of 
euphoria.
Because drugs work with 
a greater effectiveness than 
natural chemicals, the body 
starts to depend on the drugs 
rather than natural chemicals 
to achieve the same physical 
feelings, causing an addic
tion.
Alcoholism is another com
mon addiction. According to 
www.mayoclinic.com, drink
ing alcohol alters the chemi.cal composition in the brain.
One important chemi
cal, GABA, is increased. This 
causes depression of the 
nervous system and makes 
the drinker feel relaxed and 
happy, but also uncoordinat
ed and confused. Dopamine 
production is also increased, 
as with smoking.
Over time, chemical imbal
ances cause drinkers to feel a 
need for alcohol to be relaxed 
or happy again. However, as 
the tolerance to alcohol in
creases, the amount of alco
hol one needs to drink to re
store an adequate amount of 
chemicals is increased.
Alcoholism may eventually 
cause serious diseases includ
ing cirrhosis of the liver, cog
nitive problems, and epilepsy. 
Death may also be a conse
quence of alcoholism.
Many factors, including 
age and gender, are respon
sible for an individual becom
ing addicted to any drug. In 
addition, genetics play a role 
in how easily one becomes 
addicted to certain drugs. For 
example, people with a family 
history of alcoholism may be 
more likely to become alco
holics.
Addictions can also mani
fest themselves as compulsive 
behavior or an inability to 
control impulses. Oniomania 
is a medical term for an addic
tion to shopping. People with 
this disorder often find them
selves irritable when they are 
not shopping, or always think 
about buying.
In addition, shopping be
comes so sustained that other 
activities, like working at a 
job, become compromised, 
leading to financial hardship.
A gambling problem, or 
ludomania, causes people 
to become preoccupied with 
gambling. They may think 
constantly about winning and 
may bet higher and higher 
wagers to sustain a rush 
feeling. Often other people 
are affected by people with
gambling addictions.
Another addiction that has 
only recently existed is an In
ternet addiction. According 
to www.nurseweek.com, this 
addiction was first created as 
a hoax, but has become ac
cepted as a psychological con
dition.
Usually, Internet addiction 
is described in subcategories, 
like obsessive social network
ing site usage and excessive 
Internet shopping.
All addictions can be 
characterized by withdrawal 
symptoms when the behav
ior is stopped. According to 
www.aafp.org, these with
drawal symptoms can include 
irritability, depression, physi
cal sickness such as nausea, 
and even insomnia.
However, all addictions 
can be treated through psy
chological counseling and 
support from friends and fam
ily. It is never too late to reha
bilitate an addict.

general feature of all pho

conditions, this could come as 
a pleasant find for the renew
able energy industry.

If you havent been living under a 
rock (or in a cluster), you probably 
know by now that the U.S. House of 
Representatives passed a compre
hensive health care reform bill late 
Sunday, March 22. You also probably 
know that Republicans are unhappy 
with the bill.
Though there are strong views 
and valid points on both sides of the 
debate, it is actions outside the po
litical arena that concern us most. In 
the week since the passage of the bill, 
several Congressmen have received 
threats and had their offices vandal
ized as a result of their votes. These 
petty acts of violence violate the core 
principles of our republic.
The past few years have seen a dis
turbing polarization of the American 
political establishment as the Repub
licans and Democrats move farther
apart. As the parties have appealed 
to their bases, the radical factions 
of each side gain influence. Yet this 
polarization does not excuse threats 
of violence against elected officials. 
This is not a country with autocratic 
rule, where there exists no lawful 
way to change the government. It is 
not a totalitarian state where violent 
protest is the only way to make ones 
voice heard. We are in a midterm 
election year, and those who have 
grievances with the current leader
ship should take their anger and join 
political groups or run for office.
Though Democrats would like to 
paint the entire Republican Party as 
supporting these domestic terrorists, 
this is a willful misconception. Peo
ple who believe that threatening the 
families of Congressmen is a valid 
political statement are not part of our
political process. They have probably 
not read any part of the actual health 
care bill, nor have they likely edu
cated themselves about both sides 
of the debate. Doing so would have 
required knowledge of the principles 
of American government, something 
these terrorists obviously lack. In
stead of relying on facts, these indi
viduals know only what they have 
heard from sources like Glenn Beck 
and Rush Limbaugh.
The trend of radicalization and 
extremism in American politics over 
the last decade has grave risks for 
our future as a democracy. In a na
tion of laws, there should never be 
justification for threats and violence 
against government officials. Rather 
than participating in democracy, 
those who commit these acts attack 
its very foundations.
Execution for sorcery violates basic human rights
In many places, fortune telling will 
get you snickers, a few sarcastic com
ments, and some cash from tourists 
passing through the carnival square. 
In Saudi Arabia, it gets you sentenced 
to death. We had hoped that govern
ment-sponsored witch hunts were an 
activity resigned to textbooks, but 
clearly not in Saudi Arabia. .
Earlier this month, Ali Hussain 
Sibat, a Lebanese TV show host who 
predicted the futures of those willing 
to call the show, had his death sen
tence upheld in appeals court. Sibat 
has been held since May 2008, when 
he was arrested for sorcery by the 
Mutawaeen, Saudi Arabias religious 
police.
Amnesty International is calling 
on authorities to release him, stating, 
The crime of sorcery is not defined  
in Saudi Arabian law but is used to 
punish people for the legitimate ex
ercise of their human rights, includ
ing the rights to freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion, belief, and ex
pression.
We at The Tartan, unsurprisingly, 
side with Amnesty and believe in al
lowing people in all nations to exer
cise freedom of thought, expression, 
and speech. Sorceresses, wizards, 
necromancers, warlocks, magicians, 
and psychics are all legitimate ex
pressions of these freedoms. Allow 
them to practice their sleights of 
hand, to channel energies from ley 
lines, and to read from their crystal 
balls if people want to believe.
Americans have responsibility to complete census
April 1 is National Census Day. 
And while you might not have known 
that, you probably are aware that the 
2010 United States Census is already 
here. In addition to the national 
marketing campaign for the census, 
Carnegie Mellon has also been doing 
its part to encourage students to par
ticipate. Though it might seem like a 
nuisance, were excited that the ad
ministration has taken this stance. 
President Cohon recently e-mailed 
the campus community reminding 
us of the census and highlighting 
its value. Resident assistants will be 
following up, actually providing stu
dents with the appropriate forms.
The slogan for this years census 
is We cant move forward until you 
mail it back. We all acknowledge 
that census data is important. The 
information is used, according to 
the census website, to advocate 
for causes, rescue disaster victims, 
prevent diseases, research mar
kets, locate pools of skilled workers 
and more, as well as allocate more 
than $400 billion to states and com
munities.
Large, national changes have also 
been made. The census form has 
only 10 questions and should take 
only 10 minutes to complete. You can 
track census data online, real-time,
with interactive maps that show the 
participation for various regions. 
Carnegie Mellon currently has a 35 
percent response rate. The Census 
Bureau has also launched a TV ad 
campaign using census form-themed 
graphics, including personified Xs, 
to demonstrate the importance of 
the census data. The ads stress issues 
from schools and roads to hospitals 
and community development, while 
incorporating a sleek design.
We are pleased to see that the uni
versity is taking an active role in pro
moting the 2010 Census, and hope 
that students will take it seriously as 
well.
Health care bill abortion 
debate benefits women
JESSICA THURSTON
Last week, President Obama 
accomplished perhaps the great
est task of his presidency: He made 
health care reform a reality with his 
partners in Congress. In a last-min
ute ploy to sway those Congressmen 
who needed to appease their pro-life 
or otherwise ill-informed constitu
ents, Obama issued an executive or
der just before the passage of the bill 
on March 21. Underscoring the ex
isting language of the bill that delin
eated this payment package, Obama 
explicitly stated that federal funding 
cannot be used to finance abortions.
Ultimately, though, what will 
change?
At the moment, it seems that 
nothing, really, will change. Physi
cal access to elective abortion proce
dures should be the same after rati
fication as it was before the bill was 
signed into law. Resource centers 
such as Planned Parenthood still ex
ist, will still provide medical and sur
gical abortion procedures around the 
United States, and will still do their 
best to ensure that women seeking 
pregnancy termination are able to 
find the funding to do so when they 
need it most. Doctors in other offices
can still perform abortions as well  
the only thing that might be different 
is who you pay for the procedure.
Public perception of the relation
ship between public health care and 
womens fertility rights has indeed 
been altered, however. In the long 
run, those of us who see the right to 
an abortion and the overall control 
over ones own reproductive health 
as inherently sacred might see a 
change for the better. That is, the 
outrage on the part of staunchly prochoice groups, such as Planned Par
enthood, to Obamas executive ordeir 
could incite a movement of more 
candid dialogue about womens re
productive rights.
To my fellow pro-choicers, who 
understand that the reasons for 
which women might need to procure 
an abortion are incredibly complicat
ed, I want to make a call to you: Nev
er back off from fighting for womens 
reproductive health rights, especially 
for women trapped in under-served 
communities or otherwise unsafe 
environments. However, do not turn 
against this significant piece of social 
legislation, which is inherently leftward-leaning and intended to serve 
those previously left unprotected in 
a world of ever-increasing insurance 
premiums. Use the language of this 
bill to move forward.

Threats against legislators undermine democracy
Republicans attacks 
reveal own hypocrisy
GREG HANNEMAN
When a group of Republican 
members of Congress started a slowburn effort to smoke information out 
of the Department of Justice, they 
may not have expected that, when 
the pot finally boiled over, the only 
dish they served themselves was a 
helping of hypocrisy.
Senator Charles Grassley (R 
-Iowa) and a handful of other Re
publicans had been putting pres
sure on U.S. Attorney General Eric 
Holder since last fall to release the 
names of nine appointees in the 
Department of Justice who, in their 
previous practice, had represented 
or advocated on behalf of detain
ees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Such 
conflict of interest, the group stated, 
raised serious questions about who 
is providing advice on detainee mat
ters. That month, the Justice De
partment released the names of two 
of the officials.
The real firestorm ignited earlier 
this month, when Keep America Safe
 an organization partly run by Liz 
Cheney, daughter of the former Vice 
President  posted an online video 
ad ominously asking, Who are 
these government officials...? Why 
the secrecy behind the other seven? 
Whose values do they share?
The response was explosive. Ac
cusations of McCarthyism and trea
son were flung back and forth faster 
than commentators could keep track 
of them. And when Grassley and 
Cheney got their answer a day later, 
all the puffed-up threats of terror 
sympathizers in the federal govern
ment collapsed faster than  deflat
ing souffle. A review of documents
and reports carried out by Fox News 
revealed that most of the dreaded 
al-Qaeda Seven had only minor 
or short-lived roles in representing 
detainees.
Furthermore, as the same Fox 
News article pointed out, the 
Obama administration is not the 
first to hire lawyers who represented 
or advocated for terror suspects. 
President George W. Bush had at 
least three of them during his term, 
during which time none of the cur
rent conservative pot-stirrers had 
anything negative to say about the 
matter.
This flip-flopping behavior is 
turning into a general GOP trend. 
Republicans have been showing a 
disturbing lack of respect for the 
established truth  even from their 
own archives. During the House 
debate on health care reform two 
weeks ago, Republicans decried the 
Democrats proposed use of a deem 
and pass procedure, one employed 
more than 35 times during the last 
Republican-controlled Congress. In 
2006, former New York Mayor Rudy 
Giuliani touted the American justice 
system for bringing terror suspect 
Zacarias Moussaoui into civilian 
court and giving him a fair trial. We 
are a nation of law, he said then. 
Last year, however, Giuliani derid
ed the proposal that 9/11 planner 
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed could be 
brought to trial in New York instead 
of to a military tribunal, saying that 
it would be an overconcern with 
the rights of terrorists.
As Cheneys scare-mongering 
video and Grassleys scandal-digging 
quest highlight, the Republicans are 
increasingly a party more interested 
in politics than progress, or even 
consistent policies.

Software patents limit creativity, innovation
ISAAC JONES
Recently, CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
and other people of software devel
opment importance at Facebook Inc. 
were awarded a patent for the News 
Feed feature. This patent, entirely 
based on software, is very potent 
and has significant implications for 
other social networks. It is not as 
general as many other patents, but it 
is a symptom of a larger problem in 
the U.S. patent system.
The system of intellectual prop
erty (IP) legislation was set in place, 
according to the U.S. Constitution, 
to promote the progress of science 
and the useful arts, by securing for 
limited times to authors and inven
tors the exclusive right to their re
spective writings and discoveries. 
IP legislation covers patents, trade
marks, trade secrets, and copyrights. 
However, the current system has ma
jor flaws in the application process 
for patents. These flaws allow corpo
rations to abuse the patent system to 
leech resources from companies  
resources that would be better spent 
improving products.
The patent system is lax, and in
tentionally so. Allowing laxity in a 
system of IP protection permits pat
ents that need not have practical 
applications or represent significant 
innovation on the part of the patent 
holder, in case usages are found for 
their devices during the term of their 
patent. Alternately, a patent can be 
used as a defensive mechanism, cre
ating a sort of standoff where two 
companies produce products that 
have mutual violations, but no suit 
is filed.
However, there exists a type of 
corporation referred to as a patent
troll. These corporations apply for, 
and receive, patents that allow them 
to sue existing successful compa
nies. These companies produce no 
products, so they are not afraid of 
countersuits by the established cor
porations that they threaten. The 
companies are granted patents that 
allow them to siphon money from es
tablished corporations by exploiting 
weaknesses in the patent application 
process. This exploitation allows 
them to gain patents for technologies 
that already exist or patents that are 
so general that they could apply to 
almost any product on the market.
The weaknesses these companies 
exploit target the patent application 
process. When a patent applica
tion is submitted, it is reviewed by 
employees of the Patent and Trade
mark Office. These individuals are 
highly skilled in their field of study, 
but since they are expected to re
view patents from a diverse range 
of specialties, errors are inevitable. 
There is a section of the patent appli
cation, called the prior art section, 
that exists to give the reviewer the 
background information necessary 
to understand the patent. However, 
abuse patents simply omit the sec
tion entirely or overwhelm the re
viewer with hundreds or thousands 
of references, making it impossible 
to fully comprehend the context for 
the patent. This leads to the accep
tance of applications that should not 
be granted patents.
In addition, there is a new type of 
patent that is particularly vulnerable 
to abuse. These are software patents. 
Software patents are open to abuse 
because they very closely resemble 
business processes. This allows pat
enting organizations to patent pro
cesses, claiming they are software 
innovations, rather than inventions, 
and thereby removing the need for a 
physical component.
In addition, the patenting of a
mmmSBVPF encourages partnerships with student groups
At the end of this week, student 
government elections will be upon 
us again. Itll have been a whole year 
since I was in the position of the cur
rent candidates, biting my nails in 
nervous anticipation as students cast 
their votes for the 2009-10 student 
body vice president of finance. Since 
then, many things have changed, but 
the core questions in voters minds 
that are being addressed in the can
didates platforms are still the same: 
How do you plan to make the Joint 
Funding Committee (JFC) more ef
ficient? Should the activities fee be 
raised?
While those are certainly critical 
concerns, some equally important 
questions arent being asked. One of 
the foremost issues in my mind that 
I highly encourage this years vot
ers to think about as they read the 
candidates platforms and cast their 
ballots is the following: What should 
the relationship be between the JFC 
and student organizations? How can 
that relationship be improved and 
strengthened?
This might seem like a rhetorical 
question, but the reality is that it ad
dresses a key issue that has often been 
overlooked. For many years, the JFC 
has been an organization that has op
erated behind closed doors, about as
far removed from students as the CIA 
is from ordinary citizens. The JFC did 
appoint a representative to each stu
dent group seeking funding, but they 
would meet once, and it would be a 
cursory and impersonal conversation 
with the representative pointing out a 
few things in the budget proposal that 
the JFC couldnt or wouldnt fund, 
and the student group including or 
disregarding that feedback at will. 
Occasionally, an organization would 
lay out its concerns in an impassioned 
plea for more funding, but more often 
than not, the representative would 
turn around the minute those doors 
were shut and recommend a decrease. 
Historically, JFC representatives have 
been too wrapped up in the self-im
portant knowledge' that they have a 
hand in the allocation of $1.2 million. 
They have failed to fulfill their duties 
as accessible advisers and advocates 
for the groups they were appointed to 
represent.
The good news is that this has 
been changing. But the aura of mis
trust between the JFC and student or
ganizations still persists. Groups still 
purposely inflate their budgets in an
ticipation that everything will get cut 
anyway, and in return, the committee 
finds that it cant trust organizations 
to be honest about their needs. And
software application removes speci
ficity from the claimed invention, al
lowing any software application that 
performs the same function to vio
late the patent and create grounds 
for a lawsuit.
The outlook for an entity facing a 
suit for patent infringement is dire. 
All suits concerning patent infringe
ment are heard in a trial before a 
jury. The defense has little hope of 
convincing a jury, consisting of per
sons not trained in the field, of the 
highly technical differences between 
the patent they are being sued for vi
olating and the actual operating pro
cess of their product. To make mat
ters worse, even if a qualified expert 
were to be drawn in the jury duty 
lottery, the prosecution could have 
the juror removed from the jury be
fore the trial began. Because of this, 
defendants often settle out of court 
for large sums of money. This con
stant barrage of lawsuits drains the 
corporations of resources that could 
be used to create better products, 
and thus deprives the consumer of 
innovative technologies that could 
be highly beneficial.
The solution to this problem, 
however, is simple. By implement
ing a system of peer reviews, where 
subject matter experts are asked to 
weigh in on the suitability of a pat
ent application, U.S. IP legislation 
can bring some sanity back into the 
process of patents.
There are members of both the 
industry and academic communities 
that would relish the opportunity to 
review patents for the Patent and 
Trademark Office. By allowing these 
persons to review patents and have a 
word in the final decision, the integ
rity of the patent system is preserved 
without undermining the protec
tions guaranteed by the IP legisla
tion. This proposed system creates 
a much better distinction between 
those developments that are and are 
not patent-worthy and protects both 
truly innovative entities and those 
organizations that want to use wellestablished systems and concepts in 
order to improve their products.

thats what this is all about: building 
relationships grounded in trust. It is 
my firm belief that we can do audits, 
we can raise the activities fee, we can 
even redo BudgetTracker, but the JFC 
process will never be efficient or ef
fective while there is no trust and no 
partnership between the committee 
and student organizations.
This year, I pioneered a new ini
tiative in the JFC, where committee 
members were assigned to organiza
tions in October and encouraged to 
meet with their groups during the 
first semester to get to know them and 
attend their events, forming a foun
dation of understanding and trust be
fore diving into the budgeting process 
second semester. All three candidates 
running for student body vice presi
dent of finance in this years elections 
were members of the JFC during the 
fall and were, therefore, a part of that 
new program, and two of them did 
an exemplary job. Both Shanel Bu
chanan and Eric Wu met with all of 
their groups in the first semester, and 
I received several e-mails with praise 
directed at both of them for how ac
cessible and helpful they were during 
the budgeting process. Whether Bu
chanan and Wu believe in continuing 
my initiative, or if they have their own 
approach to the problem, I have full
confidence that they both share my 
ideal of fostering better, stronger re
lationships with student groups.
In the end, though Buchanan is 
a praiseworthy candidate, my vote 
in this election goes to Wu. Not only 
does he have a near-perfect com
mittee attendance record  he has 
only missed a single meeting  but 
he takes a strong stance on the is
sues he cares about, presenting his 
own opinions while also being highly 
concerned with consistency and fair
ness. But perhaps most importantly, 
his work on the CMU Portal project 
(see www.cmuevent.org) attests to 
his initiative and passion for helping 
all Carnegie Mellon student organiza
tions  not just the ones he is person
ally involved in  succeed and grow. 
This goal is directly aligned with the 
objectives of the JFC and the SBVPF 
position. After all, the ultimate mis
sion of the JFC isnt to allocate $1.2 
million; its to promote the advance
ment of all Carnegie Mellon student 
organizations within our financial 
means.

Elections 
impact lives 
of students
ANDREW MCINTIRE
Each year the student body has 
the very important task of electing 
its future student representatives. 
As a student body, we are choos
ing who we want to represent our 
needs. But how important are stu
dent elections? What does the stu
dent government do? How do they 
impact our lives? This could be a 
potentially contentious debate, 
and the answers you receive de
pend on whom you speak with.
In reality, the role our elected 
student representatives play  
serving students needs, graduate 
and undergraduate alike  is in
tegral to the functions of Carnegie 
Mellon University. These needs 
range from forming new student 
initiatives to stewarding programs 
from the past and finding liaisons 
to interact with the administration 
and with the outside community.
I have been impressed by the 
impact that students can have, 
by either joining student govern
ment or by participating in student 
groups. Important initiatives that 
affect student life and the greater 
Pittsburgh community have been 
the result of successful student 
leadership.
There was a time directly after 
this countrys most recent Presi
dential election when a swell of 
opinion around the statement 
Yes, we can created a sense of 
optimism that increased political 
and public participation. And al
though the imagery and hype has 
subsided, the sentiment remains. 
As members of the Carnegie Mel
lon community, we do have the op
portunity and ability to inspire and 
create change.
Although we tend to connect 
with the intensity of systemic and 
global change, it is the smaller, lo
cals and more community-focused 
changes that we take on as indi
viduals that will truly impact those 
around us.
On behalf of the 2010 Elections 
Board, I invite you to vote this com
ing April 3-6. Let your voice be 
heard: Participate in the change, in
novation, and student activity that 
occurs on campus each day. There 
are four university-wide executive 
positions: student body president 
and vice president, student body 
vice president for finance, and 
student body vice president for or
ganizations. Undergraduates and 
graduates can all vote for these ex
ecutives. Undergraduates will also 
be given the opportunity to vote 
for their representative to Student 
Senate, according to their home 
school.
Please join us in taking the first 
step to decide our own future as 
students. Elect those among us 
who can represent our needs and 
lead the way for change.

Senior Brandon Tarbet (above) dives for a catch at Ultimax last spring. First-year graduate student and captain Jeremy Kanter (below) lays out for a disc-during a game. The team will use the next few weeks to prepare for their 
sectional tournament, where they hope to take out Pennsylvania State and finish as one of the top teams in the region. The Tartans stand at 9-1 for the season.
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Editor
One of the strongest sports 
teams on campus doesnt even 
compete in Division III. The 
number-62 Ultimate Frisbee 
team (of 400 teams), boast
ing a 9-1 season record, is the 
only team to compete in Divi
sion I at Carnegie Mellon.
Most notable of their suc
cesses was the IUP Nut Buster, 
a 10-team tournament held in 
Indiana, Pa. on March 14-15. 
The Tartans threw better and 
ran faster than all seven of 
their opponents, including 
John Carroll University, Cath
olic University, Clarion Uni
versity, Kent State University, 
and Bloomsburg University, to 
finish the weekend 7-0, which 
included an exciting final win
against the Rochester Institute 
of Technology, 15-9.
Captain Jeremy Kanter is 
hopeful about his teams re
sults to come.
The only teams in our sec
tion that have proven they can 
be better than us this season 
are Pitt and Penn State. Penn 
State is a lot like us: a re
ally hard-working group that 
makes up for a lack of star
players by playing a funda
mentally sound game top to 
bottom, he said.
Theyve had the edge on 
us this year, winning all three 
games weve faced them in, 
but theyre a team we know we 
can beat if we put all the pieces 
together for a full game.
Just last Saturday, the Car
negie Mellon Ultimate team 
tore up the field in a one-day
tournament held in Shippensburg, Pa, a few hours away 
from Pittsburgh.
The Tartans kicked off their 
successful day at 9 a.m. with 
a match against Penn States 
B team, whom the Tartans 
steamrolled 13-1. In their next 
match, the Tartans faced the 
A team from the same school 
in an exciting battle. Despite 
an 8-7 lead, the Tartans let
their defenses down at the 
last minute and fell 10-8. This 
loss didnt stop Carnegie Mel
lon from destroying their next 
opponents, Dickinson College, 
13-5.
Last weekend concluded 
the regular season for the Ulti
mate team. They have a break 
before their sectionals in two 
weeks, hosted by Penn State 
University on April 10-11.
March Madness upsets put 
three underdogs in Final Four
MADNESS, from A12
in the first round to this school 
from central Ohio.
Other upsets in the first 
day featured the ever-dangerous Murray State Racers, a 
low-seeded tournament stal
wart the past few years. Van
derbilt had the game going 
into the final seconds, but a 
buzzer-beater from 15 feet by 
Murray States Danero Thom
as plunged a dagger into Van
derbilts tournament hopes, 
sending the Racers home the 
victors. And of course, there 
are the heroics of Brigham 
Young Universitys Jimmy 
Freddette, who poured in 37 
points en route to a double
overtime victory against the 
Florida Gators.
The second day of the 
tournament was a bit more 
relaxed than the first, with the 
only true upset going to the 
Cornell Big Red, giving them 
their first NCAA tournament 
win in a long, long time. Cor
nell used some sweet threepoint shooting and precision 
passing to pummel the Tem
ple Owls, who previously had 
the best three-point defense 
in the country.
The second-round match
ups did not disappoint. One of 
the most talked about games 
this year featured the North
ern Iowa Panthers against the 
number-one team overall, the 
Kansas Jayhawks. Kansas, a 
notoriously slow starter in 
games, immediately went 
down by eight to close out 
the first half. Supposedly phe
nomenal point guard Sherron 
Collins was having an awful 
day from the field, shooting 
less than 30 percent. Using a 
well-timed full-court press, 
the Jayhawks got within one 
point with around one minute 
left to play in the game. How
ever, the Panthers broke the 
full-court press once, using a 
long outlet pass to get the ball 
past midcourt.
The most defining moment
for the Panthers occurred in 
the next five seconds. North
ern Iowas Ali Farokhmanesh 
made a risky decision  to 
pull up and shoot a threepointer instead of burning 
the clock out. It turned out to 
be the greatest choice of the 
game, as he drained the three 
and crushed the Jayhawks 
goals of a national champion
ship.
The rest of the tournament 
also had its share of upsets, 
and it currently boasts the 
Butler Bulldogs, a five seed, 
the West Virginia Mountain
eers, a two seed, the Duke 
Blue Devils, a one seed, and 
the Michigan State Spartans, 
another five seed, in the final 
four. Out of all these teams 
West Virginia looks the stron
gest, but Duke is coming off 
a huge win against Baylor, so 
I give them the edge for the 
rest of the tournament. But, 
with the way this tournament 
is going, who am I to make an 
accurate prediction?
Mens tennis tops Eagles 5-4
COURTNEY CHIN
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
mens tennis team proved 
once again why it is a top-10 
team last Saturday, after the 
Tartans defeated number-23 
University of Mary Washing
ton 5-4. The ninth-ranked 
Tartans improved to 11-4.
Right from the start, the 
Tartans came out swinging 
against the Eagles aggressive 
doubles teams, but fell short 
of taking the lead heading 
into singles.
At the third doubles spot, 
juniors Bobby MacTaggart 
and Alex Nemerov served big 
and controlled the net the en
tire match, coming out on top, 
8-4.
We tried out a variety 
of doubles strategies that 
worked very well, Nemerov
said. Bobbys serve and my 
forehand were definitely our 
weapons of choice.
Seniors Niko Ljuboja and 
James Muliawan almost 
clinched a win, but an unlucky 
break and a hold by the Eagles 
at 7-5 gave Mary Washington 
the win. The Tartans also 
dropped their second doubles 
match, 8-2, putting the Tar
tans at a 2-1 deficit heading 
into singles.
To take the win, the Tar
tans needed to win four of the 
six singles. Senior Jon Spero 
finished first, winning 6-4, 
6-2 at the fifth spot to set the 
momentum. He was followed 
by Muliawan at third singles, 
who won 64, 6-1. Sopho
more Jeremy King, substitut
ing for first-year Harsha Rao 
at sixth singles, overcame his 
opponent 6-4, 6-4 to give the 
Tartans a 4-2 lead. Rounding
out the group was first-year 
Duke Miller, who dropped 
only four games to clinch the 
match for Carnegie Mellon.
This is the third time this 
season weve been down 2-1 
after doubles and come back 
to win against a ranked team, 
Spero said. You can only sur
vive so long playing bad dou
bles, and we-know this will 
catch up with us eventually. I 
would expect us to make some 
adjustments in doubles before 
the next match, but a positive 
is that we have been very con
sistent in singles against good 
teams.
The Tartans have a week of 
rest before they face eighthranked Johns Hopkins Uni
versity at home next Sunday. 
The Tartans will be looking 
for redemption after drop
ping a 6-3 decision in their 
last meeting.

The Carnegie Mellon golf 
team hit the links to start its 
spring season by competing 
in the three-day Jekyil Island 
Invitational last week. Held 
at the Oleander Course on 
Jekyil Island in Georgia, the 
6700-yard and 72-par tourna

the golf teams game after its 
spring break trip to Florida. 
The Tartans shot 944 (322,

to place 19th out of 27 teams. 
The first-place team was

Madness surprises; upsets everywhere
JEREMY KING
Staffwriter
The month of March 
brings with it a unique sea
son known as March Mad
ness. College basketball 
teams throughout the coun
try are entered into a pool of 
65 teams, all looking to cut 
down the nets and win a na
tional championship. Before 
this year, March Madness was 
usually unsurprising, with 
the higher-seeded teams tak
ing care of business, whether 
it be in close games or just 
absolute blowouts. However, 
this year was the complete 
opposite, as we saw brackets 
being busted from the first 
day of the tournament.
The first day of the tour
nament always brings a ton 
of excitement. People rang
ing from 15-year-old high 
school basketball players to 
60-year-old basketball gurus 
fill out brackets in the hopes 
of achieving a perfect one, 
which would immediately 
earn them countrywide fame 
along with $1 million from 
Yahoo!. Those who were 
watching on that first day 
were not disappointed.
The early set of games 
featured a few powerhouses, 
such as the always-dangerous 
University of Notre Dame and
Villanova University. Little 
did we know that the two 
teams that they were playing, 
Old Dominion College and 
Pittsburghs very own Rob
ert Morris University, would 
respectively produce some 
stunning finishes that were a 
sign of upsets to come. Notre 
Dame was upset by one point 
by Old Dominion, and Robert 
Morris brought Villanova to 
overtime before falling short 
at the buzzer.
With one upset already,, 
the first day was looking to 
be extremely crazy going 
into the later sets of games. 
Some of the top seeds, such 
as Tennessee and Baylor, 
were pushed to the limits but 
came through at the end of 
the game. t
Some other teams were 
not so lucky. The Georgetown 
Hoyas, one of the favorites to 
reach the Elite Eight and also 
the Final Four, faced a match
up with Ohio State, a small, 
guard-oriented, three-pointshooting team that was al
ways willing to run the court. 
The Hoyas came out sloppy, 
getting down by double digits 
almost immediately. Show
ing almost no will to make 
a comeback, annual power
house Georgetown went out

Last Friday and Saturday, 
the Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens track and field 
teams competed at the Wash
ington and Lee Carnival in 
Lexington, Va. The Tartans 
posted impressive results, 
with many top-10 finishes.
For the women, sopho
more Ivanna Moses led the 
charge, placing second in the 
triple jump with a distance 
of 10.87 meters. Moses also 
earned a fourth-place finish in 
the long jump, with a distance 
of 5.20 meters. First-year Car
issa lannone finished sixth in 
the javelin, throwing 28.26 
meters. Junior Morgan Faer 
also contributed to the teams 
success, with a personal re
cord of 39.22 meters in the 
hammer throw, which put her 
in seventh.
On the track, junior Court
ney Baker placed third in the 
1500-meter run, finishing in 
4:48.78, closely followed by 
teammate junior Laura McKee, who finished in 4:55.49. 
In the 5000-meter run, the 
Tartans also fared well with 
fifth- and seventh-place fin
ishes by first-year Emily Wobb 
and sophomore Cassie Wal
lace, respectively, with times 
of 18:27.38 and 19:25.90.
On the mens side, the meet 
was equally successful. Se
nior James Hulley once again 
came out on top, winning the 
discus throw in 44.37 meters 
as well as th shot put, with 
a meet record and NCAA pro
visional qualifying distance 
of 15.95 meters. Sophomore 
Ryan Kissel also achieved ex
cellent results, with three top10 finishes. He placed seventh 
in the high jump, clearing 
1.75 meters; ninth in the long 
jump, reaching 6.46 meters; 
and 10th in the triple jump, 
leaping 12.67 meters. Junior 
Pat OBrien took sixth in the 
triple jump, clearing 12.81 
meters. Finally, junior Dustin 
Musselman finished 10th in 
the javelin throw with 45.50 
meters.
Hulley was not the only

one to provisionally qualify 
for the NCAAs. Junior Nate 
Bussiere finished fourth in the 
1500-meter run in 3:53.53, 
also a provisional cut. Bus
siere also placed second in the 
800-meter run with a time of 
1:55.42.
The team performed re
ally well, Bussiere said. Both 
James Hulley and I qualified 
for Nationals, and many other
athletes put up personal bests 
for the season. If we can carry 
this momentum all the way to 
UAAs, Im excited to see what 
we can do.
The Tartans will next 
compete at the Washington 
& Jefferson Invitational. The 
hammer events will be held 
at Carnegie Mellon on April 2. 
The rest of the events will be 
hosted by W&J on April 3.

The number-11 womens 
tennis team traveled to the 
University of Mary Washing
ton in Fredericksburg, Va. 
to take on the defending na
tional champion, the Williams 
College Ephs. The match was 
very competitive, but the Tar
tans suffered a 7-2 loss to the 
number-three Ephs.
The doubles matches were 
played .indoors due to cold 
weather in the morning. The 
number-one team of sopho
more Laura Chen and junior 
Ashley Herrick fell 8-4 to 
Williams top team of Kristen 
Alotta and Nikki Reich. The 
Tartans were without the ser
vices of normal second dou
bles player sophomore Kelly 
Hart, so the team of sopho
more Courtney Chin and firstyear Alex Tapak played the 
spot. Both players performed 
well, but lost 8-6 after Wil
liams rallied at 6-4 to win 
four games straight. At third 
doubles, junior Jennifer Chui 
and sophomore Cze-Ja Tam 
won a two-hour marathon 
match, 9-8, to get Carnegie 
Mellon on the board.
It was a tough match, but 
Im glad Cze and I were able 
to fight it out for the win, 
Chui said. Williams is one of 
the best teams in the nation, 
and this match, along with 
the closeness of second dou
bles and the singles matches, 
shows we are not far behind 
them.
The match was moved 
outside at the conclusion of 
doubles as the temperature 
rose 20 degrees. The Tartans 
suffered losses at fourth and 
sixth singles, but Chen won 
at first singles against one of 
the top players in the nation 
to extend the match and make 
the score 4-2. Williams was 
able to clinch the match when 
Tapak fell 6-3,6-3 at the third 
singles spot. Williams got their
sixth point at fifth singles as 
Tam suffered a 7-6, 6-2 loss. 
The last match on the court 
was Chin at number-two sin
gles, against an opponent who 
has a current 42-match win
ning streak in her college ca
reer. Chin fought hard but lost 
6-4, 6-7, 10-8. The Tartans 
were very close with one of 
the best teams in the country.
This match was very men
tally tough for everyone, 
Chen reflected. We really had 
to elevate our games and push 
ourselves one step further to 
stay competitive. We still have 
a few weeks before UAAs, so 
well be working hard to pre
pare.
The Tartans will be back 
in action next Saturday, when 
they take on the University of 
Mary Washington, followed 
by Johns Hopkins University 
the next day, both at home. 
The Tartans beat Hopkins 7-2 
last month at the National In
doors and look to repeat their 
success.

With the swimming and diving season coming to a

after finishing third in the 200-yard butterfly, first year 
Dan Glaser-Garbrick continued on to compete at the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Swim
ming and Diving Championships and earned an AllAmerica honor after placing eighth in the same event. 
This feat is impressive for an athlete in the first year of 
his college athletic career, and it sets the tone for suc
cessful seasons in the years to come.
A native of Dayton, Ohio, Glaser-Garbrick swam all 
four years of his high school career while maintaining 
an accomplished grade point average. Moreover, Gla
ser-Garbrick competed at the state level and earned a 
top-eight position in the 100-yard butterfly during his fi
nal year of high school. He began swimming because his 
parents recognized the importance of their son having 
an active lifestyle. The regular exercise and enjoyment 
of swimming became a habit that has positively affected 
Glaser-Garbricks life. Glaser-Garbrick mentioned oth
er types of competition that he would be interested in 
once his swimming career at Carnegie Mellon is over: 
would choose to do triathlons, because they involve 
swimming, running, and biking, all of which I enjoy do
ing.
Nearing the end of his first year of college, GlaserGarbrick notes that he was nervous upon his arrival 
at Carnegie Mellon; he was concerned about how to 
handle the workload while being on the swim team. 
After experiencing the life of a student athlete at the 
university, Glaser-Garbrick has found that swimming 
helps him to stay focused and use his time wisely, both 
to complete assignments and work hard during prac
tices. With three years ahead of him, Glaser-Garbrick is 
on the way to having a successful experience as a Tartan 
student athlete.

Tales from abroad: Iceland
Follow along as this writer explores the countryside
Just a few weeks ago we became friends, and then 
she exploded. Exploded, like lava and ash forming 
mountains where mountains once were not. That is 
Iceland.
Last May, my traveling companion Amy and I 
journeyed from our homes to Boston, and then 
across the Atlantic to Iceland. We landed at Keflavlk 
Flugvoller, took a bus to Reykjavik, rented a Ford 
Explorer, and began our Icelandic road trip. Our goal 
was to drive the perimeter of the island, covering 
nearly all 832 miles of the Ring Road, Route 1.
Why an Icelandic road trip, you might ask? Well, 
that is our travel pattern. Pick a country, explore it 
in full. Staying solely in Reykjavik surely would have 
been nice, but scouting the countryside allowed 
us to see Icelandic cities with populations in the 
low thousands, reindeer grazing in valleys, sulfur 
bubbling from the ground because of geothermal 
activity right below the surface, and the clearest 
blue ice floating out to sea.
We traveled on our own, reading guidebooks before 
we went crossing the country at our own whim.
We would pull off to the side of the road at any 
opportunity, for a photograph or just to take a walk 
and enjoy the early summer sun melting piles of 
snow up at the 66th degree of latitude. On our third 
night around the island, we camped at the base of a 
waterfall; that afternoon, we climbed glaciers.
We drove through the most dynamic landscape we 
had ever seen. Streams of water from the melting 
snow and ice crisscrossed the countryside and 
created waterfalls of all sizes off nearby crevasses. 
Between the fire underground and the ice crossing 
over it, what you see one year in Iceland is 
rescuplted by the next.
Runoff from Katnajikull, a 
large glacier, slides into the 
sea.
Iceland, just recently, solicited my friendship 
as part of the countrys new marketing 
campaign, presumably to increase tourism, 
icelandwantstobeyourfriend.com. Just as it began, 
it was met with a type of fireworks as Eyjafjallajokull 
erupted, a volcano atop a glacier which has now 
been erupting for eight days and has created a new 
nameless mountain  a mountain that didnt exist 
when we were there just under a year ago.
Having canvassed the landscape and driven the 
oft-formidable Ring Road with its too-frequent onelane bridges (that is one lane total for people driving 
in both directions; the warning signs read "Einbreid 
Brjj," and you learn what that means very quickly) 
we returned to Reykjavik. We walked the city, ate 
the food, shopped the galleries, and took part in a 
club scene that begins after midnight, lasts through 
the two hours of darkness, and really gets going at 4
a.m., as the sun begins to rise back into the sky.
We stayed at the Blue Lagoon Spa and Resort, 
geothermally heated by a nearby lava formation; 
were entertained by an Icelandic metal band (the 
guitarist was shirtless save for blinking white 
Christmas lights wrapped around his chest) at Kaffi 
Hljomalind; and had drinks at Kaffibarinn  all 
reduced in price due to the recent economic troubles 
in Iceland.
We enjoyed Iceland and are already quite ready 
to return. For now, we have to be satisfied with 
watching videos on the Internet of lava thrust from 
the ground and sassy updates from the marketers of 
Iceland as we wait for our next trip to that constantly 
changing island.

Everything you need to know
About dressing like a druid and fine dining 
Dear Hoskins Brothers, Dear Hoskins Brothers,
The love of my life has 
fallen for another cape girt. 
Do you have any advice 
on the newest Carnegie 
Mellon fashions that will 
garner his attention? 
Sincerely, 
Not-So-Super Girl 
Dear Super,
Dont worry girl, Ill hook 
you up. Keep in mind, with 
the weather turning to 
spring youre going to need 
something lighter than a 
cape. My recommendation; 
your recreational World of 
Warcraft Valorous Kirintor 
Garb. This 10-man equivalent 
to the Tier 8 Mages set will 
keep more than 10 men 
chasing after you  but with 
its +305 stamina youll keep 
them running for a long time. 
Its form-fitting curves will 
show off all your assets, and 
its glowing shoulder pads are 
the accessory of the year.
Now I know this armor may be 
a little expensive  the only 
way to buy one is with Tokens 
of the Wayward Vanisher  I 
dont have the time to get 
into how to get those sick 
puppies, but you need to ask 
yourself: Is your man worth 
it? If youre asking me, which 
you are, any man who turns 
his head and goes running 
at the sign of another cape 
is not the man you deserve. 
You need a man wholl stick 
by you through the toughest 
raids and longest quests.
Randy raiding, 
Patrick Hoskins
Whats your stance on men 
paying for dinner when out 
with a girt on campus. Do 
we each use a block? Do 
I put my meal on a block 
and hers on DineX? 
Sincerely, 
Blocked Out 
Dear Blocked,
Is this a serious question? 
Why on earth are you taking 
a girl for a date on campus? 
If youre going out to dinner, 
you go off campus and you 
pay. Simple. The only time you 
should eat on campus is for 
a lunch date . You each pay 
for your own, unless she's off 
the meal plan, then you offer 
to cover her. You have guest 
blocks for a reason.
Of the restaurants on 
campus, which is the best 
for a lunch date? Gingers  
sorry, The Exchange. You 
have enough time waiting in 
line together to strike up a 
conversation, but not long 
enough for the conversation 
to get really awkward. 
Imagine trying to keep your 
cool when youre waiting for 
something from the Carnegie 
Mellon Caf  youll spend 
an hour together before you 
even get your food. Gingers 
has delicious food and plenty 
of vegetarian options.
Note: This column is not 
sponsored by Gingers, 
but we would like to be. 
All payment in the form of 
sandwiches.
Take her off campus,

Train and Butch Walker rock Carnegie Hall
Audiences were kept entertained and enthralled by last Thursdays Pittsburgh performance
Nick Guesto | Photo Staff
Train frontman Pat Monohan belts out the lyrics of a 
song at last Thursday's Carnegie Music Hall show.
Butch Walker & the Black Widows
When the lights dimmed on a roaring audience this past 
Thursday night, one could barely make out the faint 
outline of the lone man standing onstage. Suddenly, the 
chords of a guitar twanged and a spotlight lit up upon 
the man as he jumped about the stage and belted into 
the microphone. After a moment, the rest of the band 
members began to trickle on stage and pick up their 
instruments, adding to the momentum akeady building 
behind the show.
Im Butch Walker and these are the Black Widows," he 
said, gesturing to those on stage with him.
Walker was born in Cartersville, Ha. in 1969 and gained 
prominence as a strong performer in numerous bands 
in the 1980s. After being a member of both Marvelous
3 and SouthGang, he decided to start his solo career 
in 2002. During this time, he also wrote hit songs 
for other artists, including .Pete Yorn, Fall Out Boy,
The All-American Rejects, Weezer, and Dashboard 
Confessional. His latest album, I Liked It Better When 
You Had No Heart, was released on Feb. 23, under the 
name Butch Walker & the Black Widows.
The set they played Thursday was high in energy.
With lots of encouragement from the band for crowd 
participation, the audience sang along, clapped with 
the beat, and screamed wildly. Walker entertained the 
audience with amazing tricks, like throwing his guitar 
pick under his leg and catching it in midair, or throwing
his guitar across the stage to a roadie near the end of a 
song.
Im doing good. Im doing better than good. Im having 
fun, Butch remarked halfway through the show, a 
feeling obviously echoed by all members of the audience. 
During a song in which Walker played the banjo, Pat 
Monahan of Train walked onstage with a gigantic 
mustache on his face, much to the amusement of the 
audience, and started singing with Walker. The crowds 
cheering and laughter could be heard throughput 
the show. No doubt about it, everyone was enjoying 
themselves.
The set ended with what could only be described as an 
epic performance. Midway through the song, Walker 
jumped on a drum and played his guitar behind his 
head. After jumping off, he proceeded to break three 
strings at once. By the end of the song, all but one of the 
strings was broken.
I had more fun watching them perform than any other 
band I've seen, remarked James Wolpert, a first-year 
CFA student. After a performance like that, it was hard 
to imagine whether Train could top it.
Train
The first song Train played was Parachute, a popular 
song off their new album, Save Me, San Francisco. After 
playing Get to Me, the band started the chords of 
Drops of Jupiter, but, much to the disappointment of 
the crowd, stopped after a few seconds.
Monahan laughed into the microphone and said, I know 
its a Thursday night, but you guys arent ready for that 
yet. Instead, the band played Meet Virginia, a hit 
single off their debut album, Train.
During the bridge of Shes on Fire, Monahan said, I 
dont know if I can go on. Im exhausted. I need a couple 
of girls to help me. When a few girls from the front rows 
were picked to go on stage, they were given shirts to 
put on that said Trainettes on them. They were then 
taught to sing the part shes on fire," and Monahan 
encouraged the crowd to sing along.
For When I Look to the Sky, Monahan announced that 
he was going to sing the song "without a microphone 
standing between me and you, and the crowd went 
dead silent as he stood on the edge of the stage and 
sang, projecting out to the crowd using only his raw 
voice.
I dont have a Superman shirt, but I do have a Super 
Train shirt," Monahan said, pulling on a Super Train 
shirt before singing Save the Day. He also pulled up 
a girl in the front row who was wearing a similar shirt,
which she bought from the merchandise table. Monahan 
improvised a song where he sang about how they were 
wearing the same shirt.
He ended the set with the recent hit single Hey Soul 
Sister. As the lights dimmed and the band walked 
off the stage, the audience continued cheering and 
clapping, shouting for an encore. The band soon came 
back and finished the night with two songs: Drops of 
Jupiter" and a cover of Dance the Night Away.
Perhaps the most memorable part of the night was when 
Monahan shared a story that he learned from what he 
called my therapist, mainly because I paid her a lot of 
money to talk to me. Monahan described how during 
his world tour he felt frustrated because he wasnt happy 
and he wondered what he needed. When he asked his 
therapist, she replied, youre made of two people: the 
traitor that says youre not beautiful or worthy, and the 
angel that tells you that you are beautiful and deserving. 
Maybe its time to start listening to that angel.

Monohan kept the crowd rowdy, bringing multiple 
audience members up on to the stage and keeping up 
a constant conversation with the crowd.

Indie duo shape their sound
She and Him release their sophomore album, Volume Two
Volume Two by She and Him exhibits the 
heavily produced but also heavily edited quality, 
conservative song length, and wholly saccharine 
nature of the Omaha Sound. And there is something 
charming about a set of songs with no abrasions, 
violent breaks, or spots of darkness. This aint no 
Beyonce album. If you are looking for the party song, 
the power-walking song, the song to be angry with, 
or the song to cry to, look elsewhere. The tunes dip 
and twang like 21st-century doo-wop, lyrics scaling 
most everything there is to say about romance. I can 
imagine looking out at the crowd of a live show, the 
audience rocking and tapping a foot, entranced by 
the noise, countenance a satisfied smirk busy with 
musings on lost and unrequited love.
As the title would imply, Volume Two is the 
continuation of a 2008 album. (Bet you cant guess 
what that one's called.) The albums play together 
with fluidity; for the albums like the songs that 
comprise them, cohesion is the rule. Once again, 
the unlikely conjunction of M. Ward and Zooey 
Deschanel is so natural that you forget when the 
instrumental parts begin and the singing ends. Wait, 
she acts, too?
Of course, youre skeptical of the actress-singermodel. You should be! On first listen, I thought,
Oh, okay. Shes like Annie Erin Clark of St. Vincent 
without the talent and intelligence." But by the 
end of the album, I grew to appreciate the dearth of 
glittery extremities. Deschanels voice is mellifluous 
and trained. It never seems to really be aware of 
what it is singing  or better yet, has just gotten 
past it. But the best part is it doesnt emit a single 
crack or flourish of exaggerated emotion (I can 
see your halo). The smooth delivery is utterly 
satisfying, and, when you listen to the lyrics, it 
makes the emotional pull that much more forceful.
If Volume Two moves you, it will not be because of 
its edge, but because of its lack thereof. Deschanel 
lingers vocally on the rs like Kimya Dawson  an 
endearing quirk. She couldnt perform these songs 
in outrageous costumes or to Haitian victims, and 
thats okay.
If there is a serious weakness to the album, it is a 
lyrical awkwardness. Every once in a while when 
you're really getting into it, Deschanel will spit out 
an unrelatable metaphor: I followed you back to 
the end of the path, but I never found the door. But 
when the lyrics hit, they hit dead on. The seeming 
simplicity of the instrumentation, which was 
actually arduously plotted, is mimicked in lyrics like, 
I think about you, then /1 think about you again / 
and again.
M. Ward doesnt need a lot of noise to create an 
idealistic haze behind the vocals. The background 
music persists with unprecedented clarity in a 
blog-formulated world that appoints a thousand 
variations of lo-fi to its highest offices. I couldnt list 
many other artists who can make guitars and pianos 
sound like Washed Out at his chilliest.
The first two releases by She and Him dont do 
everything. They actually kind of only do one 
thing. They hold you up and keep you there for the 
duration of their play time, marinating you in an 
its all right attitude, which is, Id argue, one thing 
damn worth doing. Everything is romance, but a 
self-conscious adolescent romance, nothing about 
being crazy in love." Nothing too fierce for lying in 
the grass or doodling at a caf.

album Volume Two was

On audiences
Dancing is legal in all 50 states, but you would never know it 
from going to a Carnegie Mellon concert. Last Tuesday, the 
8-Bit Alliance Tour rocked Rangos, but there was no fever 
pitch. As New Yorks Anamanaguchi played the last act of 
their month-long U.S. tour, I couldnt help but notice that our 
crowd was stiff and our emotions dissonant.
With no kick from the crowd, Anamanguchi was surprisingly 
upbeat. I wondered what it would be like to follow these guys 
with a camera on a concert tour.
Ive always found rock documentaries a little funny because, 
while you follow the band through their trials and tribulations, 
you also follow their audience. A good audience is what butters 
a musicians bread. Audiences should learn how to give their 
performers a good show because concerts arent cheap, and 
its hard to get what you pay for. Concert documentaries have 
to be the best way to learn to dance and feel comfortable 
looking like an idiot.
The Rolling Stones have documentaries like Shine a Light 
and Gimme Shelter. They are the head-banging concert 
documentaries that, when made by such famous directors as 
Martin Scorsese and the Maysles brothers, have inspired the 
rest. The Maysleses revealed a harrowing image in 1970 with 
Gimme Shelter. I personally prefer the documentary A Skin a 
Night that followed the band The National. Under Great White 
Northern Lights, the documentary about The White Stripes, 
was screened on campus just last week.
Concerts have the potential to become amazing experiences, 
but I wonder if people dont see them that way. I remember 
watching The Nationals concert documentary and thinking I 
would give anything to be at that show. Maybe that was when
I stopped standing at concerts and started dancing.
Why doesnt Carnegie Mellon have more dancing at 
concerts? I dont know. I just hope we do our part and get a 
great concert someday. Besides, if no one else is dancing, I 
just look like an idiot.

International film festival explores global responsibility
Carnegie Mellon Humanities Center and Pittsburgh Foundation showcase diverse features
From March 25 until April 4, the Carnegie Mellon 
Humanities Center and the Pittsburgh Foundation are 
sponsoring the "Faces of Globalization" International 
Film Festival in conjunction with the Humanities Center 
theme of "Global Connections, Global Responsibilities." 
Various lectures and the festival itself will work to define 
globalization. One of the lectures actually took place 
the day before the opening of the film festival; Maha 
Abdel-Rahman spoke about NGOs and the debate over 
the success of their efforts. This is the fourth year that 
Carnegie Mellon has helped to make the film festival a 
reality. Past topics have included Faces of Democracy," - 
Faces of Mechanization, and Faces of Realism."
The director of the event, Jolanta Lion, expects the films 
he features in the festival to meet certain guidelines. I 
search for recent film productions with artistic merit that 
bring to light dimensions of the festival topic, Lion said. 
Features in the event are usually ones that have not been 
released to the public and would have never been shown 
in Pittsburgh if not for the festival. The 16 events range
from documentaries to feature-length films that contain 
messages on issues such as global war and climate 
change. The first film, The Age of Stupid, premiered 
on Thursday, March 25 at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers 
Melwood Screening Room at 7:15 p.m.
Since the festival draws attention to work in multiple 
fields and disciplines, several Carnegie Mellon professors 
will be speaking at the documentaries, including CIT 
professor Cliff Davidson of the civil and environmental 
engineering department and professor Roger Rouse of 
the history department. At the premiere of the festival, 
Davidson hosted a question-and-answer session 
focusing on the climate change of 2055 and the eventual 
end of all mankind.
Rouse is moderating a film entitled The Wondrous World 
of Laundry, which centers on the lives of Polish workers 
on the German border and their struggle to maintain 
their families in the midst of job uncertainty. Through 
dialogues with three Polish women, the documentary
tries to answer the question stated by Rouse: What 
happens to family life when people are increasingly 
pushed and pulled by transnational flows of capital and 
labor?
This festival is intended to provoke thought and inspire 
action, as well as provide a source of entertainment 
for campus. Students, faculty, and the general public 
are encouraged to attend the film festival, especially 
since several of the documentaries are being shown 
on campus. Students are able to view all of the films, 
which are inspiring and emotionally engaging, for 
free. Students can experience new perceptions 
of globalization while experiencing much-needed 
relaxation during the second half of the spring semester.

It Might Get Loud
Thursday, April 1 
8 10 12
Well-known guitarists Jimmy Page, 
The Edge, and Jack White are the 
focus of this documentary about 
the history of the electric guitar. The 
movie tracks the development of the 
unique styles of each of these three 
men, from how they initially learned 
to play to how their distinctive 
sounds paved their way to success. 
The film concludes with a meeting of 
the three rockers. It Might Get Loud 
is an entertaining look for those who 
want a detailed insight into the minds 
of some of the greatest guitarists of 
today.

The Princess and the Frog
Friday, April 2 
68 10 12
The Princess and the Frog was 
nominated for three Academy Awards. 
But perhaps most importantly, the 
movies lead character Tiana is Disneys 
first black animated princess. The story 
itself is a classic; Through a series of 
crazy happenings, a prince is turned 
into a frog, and our heroine meets the 
same fate after being mistaken for a 
princess by the prince. The two decide 
to team up to fix their dilemma and 
face much hilarity and shenanigans 
along the way. The film is widely viewed 
as a commercial as well as a critical 
success, having made $300 million 
worldwide.
No Instruments Aloud
Saturday, April 3 
Time: TBA
The Carnegie Mellon Originals are an 
all-male a cappella group that have been 
performing around campus since the 
beginning of 1996. This Saturday, the a 
cappella group will convene to present 
the annual concert No Instruments 
Aloud in McConomy Auditorium. Last 
year, the group performed several songs 
including Grazing in the Grass, Lost in 
Canada, Hanging by a Moment, and 
Paralyzer. Also performing at the event 
is Carnegie Mellon's coed a cappella 
group Soundbytes.
Daybreakers
Sunday, April 4 
81012
A world where everyones a vampire 
 sounds like the dream of every 
Twilight fan? Only, in this world, 
everyone is a bad vampire and 
they have imprisoned the remaining 
humans to farm them for their tasty, 
nutritious blood. Thats the premise 
of Daybreakers, a 2010 sci-fi thriller 
starring the actors of Jurassic Park. 
The films distinctive look and story 
have earned it decent reviews among 
critics and moviegoers alike. Fun fact: 
To make it look like the world was 
overrun with vampires, the makers 
of the movie hosted a contest where 
ordinary people could submit images 
of such a world online.

Floral prints, blazers, and high-waisted bottoms rule the runway
Revamp your wardrobe with this seasons hottest fashion trends and must-have accessories
Meela Dudley | Pillbox Editor
Matching a floral dress with a loose-fitting cardigan is 
sophisticated and adorable.
high-fashion vibe against to contrast casual cotton 
ensemble, and a colorful scarf, a hairpiece, or big 
sunglasses will perfect the look.
Guys should sophisticate their everyday jeans and white 
T-shirt combo with a casual blazer. Finish this look 
with a pair of high-tops or colorful sneakers. The double 
blazer was one of the feature aspects of Milans fashion 
week. Roberto Cavalli layered his spring 2010 blazers 
with denim and khaki in his Milan show, and inspired 
audiences with his scorched sand colors and exotic 
patterns.
Flowery sundresses and jumpers 
Recently, our generation's childhood wardrobes have 
inspired several reinvented fashion trends: large 
hair bows, pastel leggings, baby-doll cuts, and most 
relevantly, floral sundresses and jumpers. Brightly colored 
floral fabrics are hot right now; they can be found in the 
spring 2010 Christopher Kane, Erdem Moralioglu, and 
Ralph Lauren lines. Coincidentally, floral was a prevailing 
theme in this year's Paris Fashion Week as well.

With every change of season comes a change of 
wardrobe, and with the incoming warm weather this 
spring, be sure to update your closet with the hottest 
trends;
Wardrobe must-haves
The casual blazer
Whether fitted or loose, the casuaj blazer is th perfect 
addition to your wardrobe. Blazers work universally. 
When used as a light jacket, are perfect for those breezy 
spring days. This years most chic blazers can be found 
in the spring 2010 lines of Burberry, Phillip Lim, Zac 
Posen, and Chlo.
Females should, try a fitted blazer with dark jeans, 
high-heeled boots, and a frilled, colorful cami. The 
blazer should cinch at your waist to create an hourglass 
figure while adding a hint of urban sophistication to the 
colorful pattern of your spring top. If youd rather wear a 
loose-fitting boyfriend blazer, try pairing it with a highwaisted cotton skirt, V-neck T-shirt, and a powerful 
accessory. Your blazer will create a contrasting
for a more bohemian feel. The most popular sundresses 
have wide straps and a soft, round neckline. Feel free to 
spice up a floral dress with a solid-colored pashmina and 
a classy pair of wedges.
High-waisted pants, skirts, and shorts 
If you havent caught on to the high-waisted trend as 
of yet, now would be the time to do it. High-waisted 
bottoms have been all over the fashion scene ever since 
the spring of 2008. The high waist is flattering on a 
woman; it hugs the thinnest part of her torso and veils 
her hips in fabric. These high-waisted bottoms have 
been all over the catwalk in the lines of Nanette Lepore 
and Emilio Pucci, and were the focus of Laqui Demkiws 
most recent London Fashion Week collection.
When choosing a high-waisted bottom you have several 
options. You can try a narrow or full high-waisted 
skirt, either thin or full. A thin skirt protrudes less from 
your waist and is typically made of cotton or another 
soft casual material. This skirt is perfect for everyday 
dressing when paired with a V-neck T-shirt or colorful 
blouse. You can also try a full high-waisted skirt, which 
is usually given a bowl shape and made of a more formal 
material like a sheer or silk. Make sure to purchase a

skirt with an elastic waist  the piece will be more 
comfortable and will move with your body. Avoid pairing 
your high-waisted skirt with ruffles or a top with extra 
fabric, as you dont want your ensemble to look too busy.
Many designers have also become fans of the 
high-waisted shorts and pants. While pretty much 
anyone can properly pull off a high-waisted skirt, pants 
or shorts will only look right on certain body types. Highwaisted skinny jeans are adorable, but it can be difficult 
to find the proper top and accessories to pair with the 
look. Keep in mind that if you choose a pair of highwaisted jeans, the heavier fabric will act like a corset 
and may become awfully uncomfortable on hotter spring 
days.
Trendy spring accessories
Messenger bag/purse
This fashion trend is both sensible and adorable. The 
tiny messenger purse or bag is the perfect size to fit all 
of your necessities  your cell phone, wallet, lip balm, 
and iPod  and, because it is strapped around your 
torso, it is the perfect city accessory. Messenger bags are 
safe as well as trendy; you always have your belongings 
in plain sight, and the bag itself cant'be lost when it is 
draped around your body.
Messenger bags can also make great book bags. 
Backpacks can load a lot of stress onto your back and 
often make you sweaty and uncomfortable in hotter 
weather. The bulkiness of a backpack can weigh you 
down and create a turtle-shell effect, while a messenger

bag works with your body.
For men, a messenger bag can be the perfect final 
accessory for a collegiate look; pair it with a casual 
blazer and a pair of Vans and youre ready to go. Urban 
Outfitters sells great casual messenger bags and purses, 
but The North Face makes some interesting bags that 
are very functional as well.
Elastic belt
In both the fall and spring 2010 fashion week catwalk 
lines of VPL, Marc by Marc Jacobs, and Proenza 
Schouler, the elastic belt may have been the most 
useful fashion accessory. Outfit feeling a bit shapeless? 
Strap an elastic belt around that hobo-boho sweater 
or baby-doll dress and watch as your figure magically 
reappears. Gather a loose-fitting jacket and cinch it 
gracefully at your waist to lighten your silhouette. The 
belted possibilities are endless. Consider purchasing a 
wide elastic clasp belt from American Apparel to strap 
around that blazer or sundress for a tailored look.
Unusual hosiery
Patterned tights may possibly be one of the most 
entertaining trends of the new season. Whether tattered 
and torn for the grunge look, or puckered and paired 
with a tutu, a festive choice of tights or leggingds is the 
perfect accessory to spice up your wardrobe this spring. 
Allow us to introduce you to our latest leg wear crush; 
patterned tights. Semi-sheer and 80s-inspired, these 
wispy stockings are turning up on lovely legs around 
the world," raved fashion blogger Penny Lane of www. 
whowhatwear.com. We adore the way they perk up an 
all-black outfit."
Several designers have chosen to incorporate patterned

or textured hosiery in their latest lines. Balenciaga 
featured polka dot tights in their spring 2010 fashion 
show, while the New York Fashion Week runways were 
littered with the accessory. Expect to see some pretty 
creative colors and patterns this spring.
Spring booties and heels
Everyone is bound to get sick of their flip-flops or their 
reliable" pair of flats, but its hard to find shoes to 
wear when you're sick of sandals in springtime. Think 
"high-heeled by pairing your everyday ensemble with 
a bootie, wedge, or strappy heel. Boots were a popular 
trend this fall with an influx of new creative designs; 
however, the popular booties have carried us right 
into spring. These shoes cut at your ankles and are 
super adorable when paired with skinny jeans or sheer 
leggings. Do be careful, however, as booties tend to cut 
the length of ones legs drastically.
For a more casual heel, try a pair of simple wedges 
or strappy heels. Wedges are often a popular choice, 
as they are sturdy and easy to walk in. Wedges were 
especially common in Milans spring 2010 fashion week, 
making appearances in the lines of Dolce and Gabbana, 
Fendi, Marni, Moschino, and Frankie Morello.
The snow has melted and it is finally time for your 
undercover fashion fanatic to emerge from hibernation. If 
youre looking to reinvent yourself this spring, revamping 
your wardrobe may be the perfect way. Follow the lead 
of your fellow students and jump into the new season on 
a positive note with these trends. Together, we can all 
make Carnegie Mellon just a little bit more fashionable.

Spring 2010 TV guide
Get advice on which shows are worth watching this season
Its a Monday night, and most Carnegie Mellon 
students have done their homework and have 
absolutely nothing to do. The laundry is done, the 
rooms are cleaned, and the meals cooked,.but time 
simply wont fly. One could watch TV, but with so 
many TV shows out, we just dont know which 
ones are worth watching and which ones are not. 
Well, worry not; here is your ideal spring TV show 
guide. Below is a list of some of the most popular 
series going on right now, my personal favorites and 
definitely some to watch out for. Statutory warning: 
Some of these TV shows are extremely addictive; 
ready for all-nighters?
24
After eight seasons, people would assume that a 
show would lose its charm or become boring and 
prolonged, but 24 proves otherwise. Each season 
of this show has 24 action-packed episodes, each 
an hour long. My personal favorite character from 
this popular series is Jack Bauer. Throughout 
the series, he is constantly put in positions that 
require re-examination of a persons fundamental 
beliefs about what is right and wrong. 24 is one of 
the most innovative, ground-breaking, intelligent, 
well-written, unpredictable, and suspenseful 
television series of its time.
One Tree Hill
A very old, yet popular, TV series that seemed to 
have lost its charm is back with a seventh season. 
After a series of dramatic and unnecessary episodes, 
this TV classic has regained its spark even though 
its two principal characters  Peyton (Hilarie 
Burton) and Lucas (Chad Michael Murray)  have 
left the show. This season has jumped 14 months 
into the future, with each of the characters settled in 
their jobs and lives. If you have never seen the show, 
you have a lot of catching up to do. I personally do 
not recommend seasons five and six, but the first 
few seasons and season seven are must-watches. 
And for all those interested, Robert Buckley from The 
Lipstick Jungle is now playing an irresistible agent 
in the reinvented series. One Tree Hill is scheduled 
to resume again on April 26.
Gossip Girl
What could better describe the show than the series 
own catch phrase: "You know you love me. This 
show takes college and the New York Upper East 
Side drama to another level. Currently airing season 
four, this show has made its way to the top of many 
peoples lists. You have to love Blair Waldorf and her 
ways and the way Chuck Bass and she complement 
one another. Even though it might be difficult for 
many to relate to this level of drama, you cant help 
but be addicted to the show. Gossip Girl allows you 
to look into the lives of the Queen Bee, the young 
girl trying to make her way to the top of the social

friends in a dorm lounge.
ladder, the cute boy next door, the player, and the 
lost party girl finding her way in life.
Modem Family
A hilarious show capturing the experiences of being 
a parent, no matter how chaotic and impossible 
and highly embarrassing it may be, Modem Family 
makes you laugh until youre almost in tears. Still on 
its first season, this show is about the stories of three 
families. The first family is made up of an extremely 
old man and his gorgeous young wife. The second 
is that of his son and the sons gay husband, and 
the third family is the old mans daughters family. 
The show is a pleasant relief from all the drama and 
suspense of college life.
Of course, there are several other great TV shows 
currently going on. Did you think that you werent 
getting enough of Greek community drama at 
Carnegie Mellon and you wanted more? Then the 
TV show Greek seems like the show for you. Other 
shows that are worth watching include Jersey Shore, 
an extremely hilarious TV show, How I met Your 
Mother, 90210, American Idol, Chuck, Lost, and 
Community. Also, make sure to watch out for this 
years 100 Questions and The Deep End.

This week, you will conquer the ancient gods of the Egyptian 
religion. Ra is not very good at housework, so assign him to 
be your gardener.
You must accept the truth: You wouldnt make it as a semiprofessional arachnid tamer, no matter how many barrels of 
spider pheromones you purchase.
You will perfect the formula for granting additional superhuman 
abilities to persons who already have them.
Weeping will get you nowhere. Your beach house has been 
completely ruined by an aardvark infestation.
Your roommate next year will have an unidentifiable ethnicity. 
This is because you are not sure where Treants hail from, but 
you would feel awkward asking.
The exchange program you are considering seems ideal, 
but in reality it is a slave labor camp set up by the remnants 
of the USSR. Avoid it unless you enjoy breaking rocks and 
digging holes.
The stars cant give away specifics, but be careful around 
staples, Walking to the Sky, and oversized 10-gallon hats 
this coming week.
You may be pretty awesome, but you arent the best. 
Remember, you dont own a porcupine like Bethany Fox of 
Buffalo, N.Y. does.
You will spend the rest of your life developing a more 
effective method for creating and organizing colonies of 
microbes. However, your enigmatic rival will beat you to every 
discovery.
Buy a trailer home, cultivate a beer gut, and get a tramp 
stamp of the Confederate flag; your new stepparent is quite 
a redneck and you will need those to blend in with your new 
family.
Attempt to set a new record for sleep deprivation. 
Approximately 33 days should be sufficient to break the 
record.
The exchange program you are considering seems ideal, but 
in reality it is a slave labor camp set up by the remnants of the 
USSR. Avoid it unless you enjoy piecing together fragments 
of rocks and filling in holes.

was a local band called Lohio.The venue, which was a large classroom 
in the University's health center, was packed with listeners who were

members for an intimate, memorable show._
