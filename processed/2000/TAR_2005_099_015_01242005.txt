Staffwriter
On Monday, January 17 2005, 
Carnegie Mellon once again cel
ebrated the life and message of 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by 
hosting several events.
University President Jared L. 
Cohon announced the annual 
account of diversity at Carnegie 
Mellon to begin the day, and 
further events followed. His ad
dress focused on the annual re
port of the Diversity Advisory 
Council  a document that has 
just recently been released to 
the public. According to Cohon, 
first-year minority enrollment 
remained steady this past year, 
and there was an upward trend 
in minority student applications. 
However, the total number en
rolling still remains low. Cohon 
also clarified a charge from The 
Chronicles of Higher Education, 
which singled out CMU and 
other universities as being over
cautious in their admissions pro
cedures when it came to minority 
applicants. CMU did not change 
its admissions procedures at all, 
Cohon stated. He did, however, 
mention changes to a series 
of race-exclusive programs in
cluding the Summer Academy 
of Math and Sciences (SAMS) 
and the Carnegie Mellon Action 
Project (CMAP).
Cohon also mentioned the role 
of women at Carnegie Mellon. 
The percentage of women in the 
undergraduate student body 
went down from last year, from 
40 to 37 percent. Among men 
and women in staff positions, 
women tend to be skewed in the 
lower level compared to men and 
minority tend to be in the lower 
grades and go down rapidly as
you go up in grades, Cohon 
said.
Cohon revealed that the plan
ning office is working with the 
diversity advisory council to cre
ate surveys to gauge where CMU 
is with regard to a diverse cul
ture and climate. It provides a 
baseline where we can measure 
progress and lack thereof in the 
future, he said, [and] it goes to 
peoples attitudes and how peo
ple feel about this place about 
their classmates and workmates 
and colleagues.
At the end of the address, 
awards were given to various 
faculty for making a difference 
at Carnegie Mellon. Those who
R. LeDuc and C. Fred Higgs, both 
assistant professors in mechnical 
engineering; Randy S. Weinberg, 
an Information Systems associ
ate professor; and Indira Nair, 
vice provost for education.
Cassandra Markoe, a sopho
more in H&SS, said of the pre
sentation, This shows that CMU 
has a large international com
munity but an underrepresented 
American minority. Looking at 
Pitt in comparison, CMU is really 
lacking. Price may be another 
factor, [and] better financial aid 
awards may be a solution.
After the Presidents address, 
there was a reading of creative 
works and presentations, where 
locals and Carnegie Mellon stu
dents read personal narratives 
dealing with racial differences 
and discrimination. Pittsburghbased Peace Links offered an in
novative puppet show based on 
The Tree House, a story by Newbery medalist Lois Lowry. There 
was also a debate in the Connan 
Room titled, Should gay rights 
be included in civil rights? The 
panel discussion was moderated 
by Everett Tademy, Director of 
Diversity at Carnegie Mellon. 
The discussion included topics 
such as whether African-Ameri
can rights could be associated 
with gay rights, whether race 
and sexuality were private or 
public issues, and whether Dr. 
King would have supported 
gay rights. LaTasha Mayes, a 
masters student in public man
agement, saw gay rights being 
labeled as civil rights as an effect 
of miscommunication on both

Arts in Society receives $500,000 grant
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
The Andrew W. Mellon Foun
dation has presented Carnegie 
Mellons Center for Arts in Soci
ety with a $500,000 grant that 
will fund the centers operations 
for the next three years.
Were very happy to receive 
the grant. We feel its a vali
dation of what weve done so 
far, said Tim Haggerty, the 
Centers associate director. The 
grant will help us continue to 
address a strategic initiative of 
the university by looking at the 
intersection of arts and humani
ties and fostering humanities on 
campus.
According to Haggerty, the 
Center is currently focusing on 
three main objectives: develop
ing a curriculum that integrates 
arts and humanities; develop
ing an Arts in Society minor, 
which will focus on an Arts 
Histories curriculum and foster 
interdisciplinary collaboration 
among Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members; and supporting com
munity outreach efforts, such as 
developing a multimedia project 
for elementary-school students.
The Centers grant proposal
outlines its upcoming activities, 
which include a series of an
nual workshops to unite schol
ars from a number of disciplines 
and colleges. Each workshop 
will begin with seminars fo
cused on readings from a spe
cific discipline, after which par
ticipants will be encouraged 
to transfer new methods and 
theories into their own research 
projects, the grant proposal 
reads. The first workshop, cen
tering on the topic of Mem
ory, is expected to commence 
this fall.
In addition to organizing 
workshops, the Center is plan
ning a year-long faculty semi
nar on the history of the arts. 
Also beginning next fall, the first 
conference will unite practicing 
artists and scholars with experts 
in curatorship and preservation. 
The seminar, (Im)permanence: 
Cultures In/Out of Time, will 
address historical and contem
porary relationships between art 
and time.
The Center anticipates emerg
ing projects from the upcoming 
Time conference and plans to 
continue additional sponsored 
research projects, including the 
Archive of Controversy in the 
Arts and the Arts and Culture
Observatory.
Finally, the Center plans an 
expansion of faculty develop
ment by enhancing its research 
fund and continuing its visiting 
scholars program.
The Andrew W. Mellon Foun
dation was the original funding 
source for the Center, which was 
established in spring 2000 as 
a bridge between the College 
of Fine Arts and the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences. 
Since then, the Center has spon
sored a regular series of events 
that blend arts and humanities. 
Our goal is to encourage people 
to think about interdisciplin
ary scholarship, said Judith 
Schachter Modell, the Centers 
director.
The Centers activities include 
panel discussions, faculty pre
sentations and guest lectures, 
and the bringing of visiting arts 
and humanities scholars to cam
pus. As part of the Universitys 
Humanities Initiative, the Cen
ter sponsors Carnegie Mellons 
Arts in Society minor.
Im really pleased with our 
progress. What weve done in 
four years is build a solid foun
dation for what the arts and 
humanities mean at Carnegie 
Mellon, said Schachter Modell.
Sorority to 
hold campus 
blood drive
by Marshall Roy
Staffwriter
Student Development and 
Kappa Phi Lambda sorority will 
be sponsoring a blood drive to
morrow from 11 am to 5 pm. The 
drive will take place in Rangos 
Ballroom in the University Center, 
and is provided by the Greater Al
leghenies Region of the American 
Red Cross Blood Services.
Often plagued by shortages, 
the Red Cross intentionally holds 
drives at college campuses because 
of the high population of healthy, 
eligible donors. According to the 
Red Cross website www.redcross. 
org, potential donors must be 
healthy, be at least 17 years old, 
weigh at least 110 pounds, and 
not have donated blood in the last 
56 days in order to be eligible.
Contrary to popular belief, 
many medications do not dis
qualify people from donating. For 
instance, donating blood while on 
most antibiotics or birth control 
is allowed. One very strict restric
tion, however, regards the spread 
of HIV/AIDS. Anyone at high risk 
for HIV infection is not eligible to 
donate blood. Anyone who has 
used intravenous drugs or had un
protected anal sex since 1977 is 
not eligible to donate blood. Fur
thermore, anyone born in Camer
oon, the Central African Republic, 
Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, 
Gabon, Niger, or Nigeria since 
1977 is also at an increased risk 
for HIV, and is therefore ineligible 
to donate blood.
Any questions or concerns re
garding blood donation can be 
answered through the American 
Red Cross website.
First-year business administra
tion major Rona Song, the com
munity service chairperson of 
Kappa Phi Lambda, said, Blood 
donation is important because at 
one time or another, most people 
will need blood that was donated 
by another person. Everyone ex
pects hospitals to have blood, but 
... daily blood inventories of the 
blood bank show that there are 
some blood types that dont even 
reach a full days supply.
Kappa Phi Lambda is sponsor
ing this blood drive because its 
one of our pillars, Song said. We

tural diversity. The blood drive is 
a great way to involve the cam
pus community, to bring everyone

CMU establishes a chapter 
of new business fraternity
Yee Mei Imee Chan, a sophomore in the Tepper School of Business and vice 
president of Administration in the new Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity, speaks to 
potential new members at an information session for the business fraternity.
by Alexandra Kilduff
News Editor
On Saturday, January 15, 
Carnegie Mellon University es
tablished a new chapter of the 
national coed business fraternity 
Alpha Kappa Psi. The chapter, 
named Omega Psi, currently has 
38 initiated brothers; it inducted 
its first member last February.
According to its national web
site, Alpha Kappa Psi is recog
nized as the premier developer 
of principled business leaders. 
Chapter president and junior 
Business Administration major 
Ran Yi confirmed this mission: 
As a business fraternity our 
main goals are to promote busi
ness issues on campus and de
velop future business leaders. 
According to Yi, Alpha Kappa Psi 
is the largest business fraternity 
in the country. We have over 
185 active chapters throughout 
the country, with over 200,000 
members inducted, said Yi.
Yi plans to start off the year 
by hosting a series of events for 
future professionals. We have 
three planned for this semester, 
stated Yi. We also have service 
events and social events each 
semester as well.
This past week, Alpha Kappa
Psi hosted a series of information 
sessions for potential members 
and is currently holding its Al
pha rush. Other rush events in
clude a trip to Mellon Bank last 
Friday; socials; and rushee inter
views in the coming week.
Yee Mei Imee Chan, a sopho
more business administration 
major and the chapters vicepresident of administration, 
originally decided to join Alpha 
Kappa Psi because of its stated 
goals. I wanted to meet people 
who share the same interests as 
I do: brotherhood, professional 
and academic development, ser
vice to the community, and net
working.
As vice-president of adminis
tration, Chan is responsible for 
supervising the chapters vari
ous committees; she also serves 
as a liaison between Carnegie 
Mellon and the fraternitys na
tional headquarters in India
napolis. She stated that she was 
looking forward to a success
ful semester. We have a group 
of highly motivated, talented, 
active, and dedicated individu
als who are truly interested in 
making a difference on this cam
pus and maintaining a strong 
brotherhood. We have already

Locals protest Carnegie Mellons military contracts
First-year CIT students Sarah Gold and Evan Sarmiento participated in an annual protest last Monday. This year the 
groups involved were F.I.S.T., Citizens Alliance Against Racism, and the Thomas Merton Center. The demonstration 
was both a tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a protest against military contracting at Carnegie Mellon.

Suspicious People on the 
Cut
15 January 2005 21:06
A student reported that 
while on the Cut, she was 
approached by a male and 
a female who asked for 
money to get home. When 
the complainant proceeded 
to give them $2, the pair 
requested that they accom
pany her to a MAC machine 
to retrieve more money. The 
complainant stated that she 
did not have a MAC card on 
her, went back to her room 
and notified campus police. 
Both of the pair, neither one 
CMU students, were identi
fied and warned off cam
pus. The female was cited 
with defiant trespass, as she 
had been previously warned 
to stay off campus.
Suspicious Activity
1.6 January 2005 00:13
Shortly after midnight, 
security guards observed 
two CMU students car
rying a road sign toward 
Frew Street. When asked 
what their intentions were 
with the sign, the students 
claimed that they were 
covering up a hole in the 
street, the location of which 
they could not remember. 
The students claimed they 
found the sign, an elevated 
warning marker with flash
ing lights, lying in a bush 
in Shadyside. There was no 
indication that alcohol was 
involved, and both students 
were cooperative as they 
were advised and warned.
Vehicle Collision
17 January 2005 22:01
The complainant reported 
that his black Mitsubishi 
Montero was involved in a 
hit-and-run in the gated CFA 
lot. The complainant parked

Despite several inches of snow, students still found time to play a game of football on the Gesling Stadium field. While 
Pittsburgh received roughly four inches of snow over the weekend, other areas of the east were not so lucky. Some 
received up to two and a half feet of snow, which crippled travel plans and businesses.

Presidential perspective: Student govt works to respond to you
, ment officials more time to find a dedi- ing vehicle registration fees, particularly Day events on campus last Monday. Thes
Erik Michaels-Ober
Last semester, I wrote about Port 
Authority of Allegheny Countys proposed 
service cuts and fare increases. Over the 
winter recess, the Port Authority received 
some short-term relief from Governor Ed 
Rendell, who transferred $4.7 million 
of flexible federal highway funds to 
Allegheny County transit. This led to 
an announcement that the cuts sched
uled to take place on March 6 would 
be less severe than originally stated. 
Service on weekends and evenings will be 
reduced, but not entirely eliminated. Port 
Authority also pushed back its proposed 
fare increases to March 1, giving govern
ment officials more time to find a dedi
cated funding source for public transpor
tation.
One such proposal comes from 
State Representative Dwight Evans of 
Philadelphia. His plan, which has the 
support of Governor Rendell, would 
provide an additional $110 million for 
public transportation across Pennsylvania 
every year by increasing certain motor 
vehicle fees and surcharges. State Senator 
Vincent Fumo has proposed an alternate 
plan that uses a real-estate transfer tax to 
raise money for public transportation.
A third plan, offered by State Rep
resentative Keith McCall, would impose 
the same tax as Senator Fumos proposal 
in addition to increasing the state gaso
line tax by four cents a gallon and increas
ing vehicle registration fees, particularly 
for sport utility vehicles and minivans. 
These plans could start being debated as 
early as today, which is the first day of 
the new legislative session. A bill must be 
passed by the end of February to stave off 
service cuts and fare increases.
Many of you have already written let
ters to your state legislators, urging them 
to provide additional funding to public 
transportation. Your letters have made a 
big difference and brought this issue to 
the forefront of state policy discussions. If 
you have yet to send a letter, or would like 
to send another one, please visit transit. 
stusen.org, where a form letter can be 
sent in less than a minute.
Additionally, I was happy to see so 
many of you at Martin Luther King Jr.
Day events on campus last Monday. These 
events remind us of Dr. Kings great leg
acy and give us the opportunity to ad
dress issues of diversity on our campus. 
President Jared Cohons State of Diversity 
Address reaffirmed the Universitys com
mitment to increasing diversity, and Dr. 
Darlene Clark Hines keynote address re
minded us of the segregation-era struggle 
of African-Americans through the life 
story of Maude Callen.
Next month is Black History Month, 
which provides another opportunity to 
explore issues of diversity and race. I 
encourage you to attend Black History 
Month events and celebrate the efforts 
being made to increase diversity on our 
campus.

Two news events from the past 
week  Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
and Michael Powells resignation 
from the FCC  motivate me to 
discuss two unrelated, but highly 
discussed and unresolved issues 
confronting our society. The events 
roused some commentators, advo
cacy groups, and politicians, but 
caused little stir on campus. Even 
MLK Day elicited little dialogue re
lated to diversity.
University President Jared Cohon 
presented his report on the state of 
diversity at Carnegie Mellon to a 
collection of community members 
 faculty, staff, and a peppering of 
students  who filled more than 
half of Rangos Ballroom.
The numbers are grim. Overall, the 
number of minorities and females, 
two groups that the report quanti
fied, remained relatively unchanged 
from the low levels reported earlier 
in the year. The percentage of under
graduate CIT and SCS students who 
are women has even decreased. 
According to the January 14 issue 
of The Chronicle of Higher Education, 
CMUs enrollment of black under
graduate students has decreased by 
more than 14 percent in the past two 
years. Minorities are also poorly rep
resented in the graduate programs 
and on the Board of Trustees.
I believe students would be 
shocked by Cohons report. I often 
hear students assert that CMU is 
a highly diverse campus. In some 
respects, it is; I value the diversity in 
our students interests. But students 
must not lose sight of the big picture. 
CMU has a long way to go before we 
can consider our community to be 
characterized by diversity.
In the Forum section of this issue, 
Alexander Su has offered his opinion 
on affirmative action, a subject mat
ter that is known to instigate debate. 
We affirm our staffwriters right to 
express their opinions, so long as it 
is in a professional and respectful 
manner. We extend this opportunity 
to the community at large. I encour
age you to share your perspective by 
sending email to forum@thetartan. 
org.
Also last week, Michael Powell 
announced that he would leave 
his post as chair of the Federal 
Communications Commission 
(FCC). Powells four years as chair 
of the FCC are marked by his censor
ship of indecency and deregulation 
of ownership restrictions.
While many people are aware 
of the $495,000 fine imposed on 
Howard Stern, too few have given 
consideration to the effect of media 
consolidation on our local communi
ties. In June 2003, the FCC relaxed 
restrictions on corporate media 
ownership, so that a single company 
such as NBC or Fox could own local 
television stations that reached 45 
percent of U.S. households.
Furthermore, the ruling decided 
that newspapers would no longer 
be prohibited from owning televi
sion stations in their base cities. 
As President Bush looks to choose 
Powells successor, it is important 
that we, who are the beneficiaries of 
a strong, inquisitive media, remain 
vigilant of the situation.
The past week was a success 
for the strength of CMUs media. 
Student-run radio station WRCT FM 
announced that its Rustbelt Radio 
program, described as a review of 
news that has been overlooked by 
corporate media, will be run on a 
weekly basis. This increase over its 
previous biweekly broadcast speaks 
volumes on WRCTs commitment to 
campus discussion and debate.
Also, nearly 30 talented students 
joined the staff of The Tartan over 
the past week, increasing our ability 
to create a useful newspaper for our 
readers.
In a time when media outlets are 
under scrutiny and embroiled in 
controversy, we hope that we can 
use our new talent to help offer an 
honest, varied, and representative 
student voice that reflects our com
munitys hopes and values.

APhiO brothers attend convention
by Alexandra Kilduff
News Editor
Over the holiday break, 
eleven Carnegie Mellon stu
dents along with members of 
the service fraternity Alpha 
Phi Omega (Kappa Chapter) 
attended their fraternitys 
35th Biannual National Con
vention in Denver, Colorado.
From December 27 to 30, 
these students, Kappa Chap
ter alumni, and 2000 other Al
pha Phi Omega brothers rep
resenting 150 schools across 
the country participated in 
legislative sessions and ser
vice projects in the Denver 
area. According to Kappa 
Chapter President Jim Kerchenfaut, the national conven
tion is host to two days of 
committees, voting on every
thing from official appoint
ments to long-term goals, as 
well as internal policy and ar
eas of the fraternity that need 
improvement. Kerchenfaut, a 
junior ECE major, said, While 
it is in session, this legislative
body is the supreme govern
ing body of the fraternity, 
making Alpha Phi Omega an 
organization truly run by the 
students. This body also has 
the power to pass resolutions, 
set directives for the national 
board of directors, set policy 
on a national level, and make 
changes to national bylaws.
One item discussed at 
length was to change a word 
in the National Song from 
men of to true to Alpha Phi 
Omega, said Elizabeth Buckser, a junior drama major and 
Alpha Phi Omegas public re
lations chair. This topic has 
been brought up every year 
since women initiated, and 
has failed [after] every at
tempt to change the words. 
Brothers of APhiO are still 
referred to as men in the 
song. Buckster added that 
leadership recognition and 
ceremony structure were 
among the other items dis
cussed.
Several Alpha Phi Omega 
alumni were appointed to 
head the national fraternity,
including Kappa Alumnus 
Lisa Covi (84, SCS), named 
Program Director.
Tom Strong (92, MCS) and 
Milton Smith (88, CFA) were 
given the Herbert G. Horton 
Service to Youth Leadership 
Award.
In addition, students at
tending the convention par
ticipated in a number of ser
vice projects and activities, 
including donating blood, 
raising funds for the recent 
tsunami disaster victims, and 
caring for Denver parks and 
public areas.
The convention also offered 
a number of leadership semi
nars as well as entertainment. 
Denver Mayor John W. Hickenlooper declared December 
27-30 Alpha Phi Omega Ser
vice Days.
I think one of the things 
I learned from there is that 
were not just an organization 
on campus, it was that were 
part of a national organiza
tion, said Kerchenfaut. We 
really do have brothers every
where.

How Things Work: Reentry and Heat Shields

Bush cuts funds for 
Hubble repair mission
The White House has rejected 
a request made by NASA in its 
2006 budget proposal for funding 
to send a maintenance mission to 
the Hubble Space Telescope. Fur
thermore, the White House has 
instructed NASAs Hubble officials 
to focus exclusively on planning 
for the telescopes death. Routine 
repair missions for the Hubble, 
which is expected to become in
operable by 2008 without main
tenance and which has gained 
significant popular support, are 
expected to cost over $1 billion, 
whereas a controlled reentry 
would not require such a mission.
NASA had planned to let the 
Hubble die naturally after the Co
lumbia shuttle disaster, when the 
entire shuttle fleet was grounded 
and no servicing trip could be 
made. The agency reversed course 
after public outcry in support of 
the telescope and put plans for 
Hubble repairs back in its docket.

believed that passing through 
the atmosphere in the shortest 
time possible would minimize 
the time exposed to reentry 
heating.
Though they were correct in 
this regard, they failed to rec
ognize the importance of in
creasing atmospheric density 
in designing the early reentry 
vehicles. These aerodynamic 
projectiles would plunge into 
the thick, lower atmosphere so 
quickly that the intense friction 
would result in unbearable heat. 
As the atmospheric drag heated 
the rockets skin, the point of the 
nose would melt away.
The pointed nose of early 
designs had such a small area at 
their tips that the accumulated 
heat had virtually nowhere to 
go. Engineers believed they could 
overcome this problem with 
super-strong, heat-hardened 
alloys. It didnt take long, 
though, to discover that every 
known alloy melted under 
temperatures achieved during 
reentry  which sometimes 
exceeded the temperature on 
the surface of the sun!
An alternative solution 
was proposed in 1952 by 
H. Julian Allen. Instead of 
making the reentry vehicle as 
aerodynamic as possible, why 
not maximize drag? This would 
increase the exposure time to 
atmospheric heating but would 
also sufficiently slow the craft 
during descent. Provided it 
could handle any heat that it 
did absorb, reentry vehicles 
wouldnt burn up in the lower 
atmosphere.
Increasing the drag on a 
spacecraft, it turns out, is simple 
just decrease its aerodynamic 
qualities. Adopting the blunt 
body design, missiles were de
signed with very round or flat 
nose cones. Reentry vehicles, 
such as the manned Gemini
and Mercury probes, had disc
shaped undersides that pro
tected the craft at speeds of up to
17,000 mph. The shape of these 
leading edges, it was found, pro
duced a bow shock  a shock 
wave that wrapped around the 
front of the craft, taking with it 
much of the heat accompanying 
reentry and sparing the craft.
The heat that did reach the 
craft, however, was still quite 
significant. While it might not 
pose a threat to the hardy instru
mentation of an ICBM, it would 
cook a pair of astronauts alive. 
To combat this heat, two schools 
of thought were developed on 
how to approach reentry.
The initial theory sent
payloads plunging almost 
straight into the atmosphere, 
like the aforementioned Gemini 
and Mercury probes. The heat 
would be concentrated on 
an ablative shield, protecting 
the pods lower sides and also 
maximizing aerial deceleration. 
Ablative materials have the 
special quality of vaporizing or 
flaking off when exposed to heat. 
As pieces of the shielding flaked 
off, they took any absorbed heat 
with them. This proved a very 
efficient method of shielding, 
but limited such reentry vehicles 
to a single use, as the ablative 
material often melted over 
the craft. The recent CassiniHuygens probe launched to 
study the moon Titan employed 
an ablative heat shield. Its shield 
experienced temperatures of up 
to 1800 degrees Celsius on its 
descent into Titans nitrogenrich atmosphere.
A second theory was devel
oped during the 1970s for the 
design of an American multi
use spacecraft, which today 
we call the space shuttle. In

Henderson awarded 
silver score for green 
LEED certification
by Danica Cowan
Junior Staffwriter
The LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) certification of Henderson House is the latest 
demonstration of Carnegie Mellons commitment to the 
environment. The Universitys inituatives in innovation, 
education, and research have been extended to encom
pass green practices that have come to span the adminis
trative and academic divide.
Since the U.S. Green Building Council bestowed LEED 
certification on New House  Carnegie Mellons claim to 
environmental fame  CMUs goal has been to have every 
building it constructs receive at least a silver rating. The 
Henderson renovation project signaled the continuation 
of this commitment to conservation.
LEED certification is based on a system of points that 
buildings earn in a variety of categories, detailing such 
topics as environmental impact, building materials, and 
energy usage. Within the LEED certification system there 
are four levels of accreditation. Out of a total of 69 points,
26 to 32 points earns a certification, 33 to 36 points earns 
a silver rating, 39 to 51 points is gold, and 52 or more 
earns a rating of platinum.
Carnegie Mellons legacy of environmental aware
ness began in the fall of 1990, when CMU formally ad
opted a recycling policy and created a position for a Re
cycling and Waste Coordinator. They also implemented 
Recycling Liaisons to promote conservation on campus. 
Since then, CMUs green practices have been steadily 
expanding.
The LEED system is a voluntary, consensus-based 
national standard for developing high-performance sus
tainable buildings, said CMU media relations in a 2003 
press release announcing New Houses LEED certification. 
The new Posner Gallery and the Collaborative Innovation 
Center (to be completed) are also set receive a silver rat
ing.
Carnegie Mellons relationship with the LEED program 
is one of the most widely publicized examples of CMUs 
greenness. With Carnegie Mellons world-renowned 
reputation for innovation and quality, LEED has benefited 
from us pursuing it as a building standard, and we have 
benefited from having LEED certified buildings, said Di
rector of Housing Services Tim Michaels.
The LEED standards have been officially adopted by 
the University, said Facilities and Management Services 
Environmental Coordinator Barbara Kiviz. During the 
building process, records must be meticulously kept in or
der to make sure regulations are met. Many of the LEED 
requirements dovetailed nicely with our goals for the proj
ect, such as reuse of materials: It would have been easier 
to completely tear down the building, but we wanted to 
save the exterior stone walls and LEED gave us points for 
doing it, said Michaels.

Trickery a tactic for 
mating cuttlefish
Smaller males of the Australian 
giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama) 
use trickery to get females to 
mate with them, according to a 
new study from the Marine Bio
logical Laboratory in Woods Hole, 
Mass. Female cuttlefish are more 
attracted to larger males, so 
smaller males mimic the behavior 
and appearance of females to get 
close to them. Once in the middle
of a pack of females, the imitators 
quickly change back. The tactic 
works; the fake females success
fully mate 60 percent of the time, 
twice as often as honest males.

The government has never seri

researchers at the Johns Hopkins 
Universitys Bloomberg School

Study author Rolf Halden said 
that the chemical has been in use 
for about 50 years at a million 
pounds per year, but that nobody

More is known about triclosan, a 
similar chemical that is easier to

Envision yourself as a mete
oroid, hurtling through deep 
space at 40,000 mph. As Earth's 
gravity attracts your small 
mass, you begin a slow, spiraling descent toward the planet. 
At 62 miles above the Earths 
surface you begin to experience 
atmospheric friction. As you 
descend, the density of air 
increases and the tiny molecules 
of oxygen and nitrogen buffet
your outer surface, slowing you 
down. This friction becomes 
so intense that you burst into 
flame, painting a fiery streak 
across the sky. Forty miles up 
you disintegrate, ending your 
long, cold voyage.
The rapid development of 
spaceflight in the 1950s raised 
an interesting problem: how can 
spacecraft survive reentry, the 
fiery trip through Earths atmo
sphere? A solution to this prob
lem would make possible the 
delivery to Earth of surveillance 
photographs, nuclear warheads,
and even astronauts. Atmo
spheric reentry poses incredibly 
harsh conditions for spacecraft 
returning to Earth, known as 
reentry vehicles. It was the pio
neering of early engineers in 
this arena that permitted mod
ern spaceflight.
But in designing the vehicles, 
engineers had to overcome a 
major preconception of ballistic 
design: the pointed nose. It was 
common knowledge at the time 
that a pointed nose would prove 
the most aerodynamic solution 
for atmospheric flight. They
Sony Electronics president to show
off QRIO robot at Carnegie Mellon
by Corinne Pascale

Its a bipedal robot that can sing 
and dance, roller skate, run, or pitch 
a ball. It can connect wirelessly to 
a home network, is equipped with 
seven microphones for ears, and has 
two digital cameras for eyes. Its the 
Sony QRIO, and the ground-breaking 
entertainment robot will be visiting 
campus on Friday, January 28.
Since Sony named the new robot 
the companys corporate ambassa
dor at its debut appearance in late 
2003, the QRIO  a name derived 
from Quest for Curiosity  has 
traveled around the world for dem
onstration events. It has shown off 
its abilities at numerous conferences 
and even conducted the Tokyo Phil
harmonic Orchestra in Beethovens 
Symphony No. 5.
This week will mark its first visit 
to an American campus. On Friday, 
the School of Computer Science and 
Professor Manuela Veloso will host 
three Sony events featuring the an
thropomorphic robot. Coming to a 
campus to be demonstrated ... will 
let [QRIO] be exposed to questions 
of the research community, said Ve
loso. I thought it would be nice for 
the faculty because many have not 
seen the QRIO before.
Sony Electronics president and 
chief operating officer Hideki Komiyama and senior engineer Todd Kozuki (CIT, 2000, 2001) will present 
the QRIO.
Time magazine declared the QRIO 
one of the Coolest Inventions of
2003, partly due to the wealth of 
features that it has used to mystify 
crowds. In addition to its athletic 
abilities  it is touted by Sony as 
the worlds first running robot  it 
has numerous impressive mechani
cal features. It can handle unstable 
terrain gracefully: Sensors on its feet 
provide clues about uneven surfaces, 
and the robot can change its stride 
accordingly. If it encounters obsta
cles, the QRIO uses sophisticated 
map generation and path-planning 
algorithms to avoid hitting anything 
it walks past. If it does happen to 
wander into an object or is pushed 
away, it will take a step back. If it is 
knocked over, stabilizing technology
within the robot has it shift its weight 
to minimize damage suffered in the 
fall. Afterwards, it will lift itself back 
up. Its probably the only humanoid 
robot that can do this well, said Pro
fessor Veloso. The QRIO can even ex
ecute tai chi with a surprising fluid
ity to its movements. Multiple QRIOs 
can perform synchronized dances, a 
feat that has been demonstrated at 
conferences worldwide.
Many consider the QRIOs hall
mark qualities to be the ones that
allow it to connect with humans. 
When people interact with objects 
in the world, their expectations of 
what the object does and what it 
knows will influence their behavior,

Pittsburgh leads the nation

When asked if CMU has been in
fluential in the growing popular
ity of LEED certification, Director 
of Housing Services Tim Michael 
replied, Absolutely. We were 
the first university in the coun
try to have LEED-certified hous
ing, and since 2003 we have had 
many inquiries and visits from 
many schools across the country 
wanting to know... the benefits to 
residents and the community for 
building green.
Not only is Carnegie Mellon a
leader in environmental design, 
but also in related academic fields. 
Ryan England, president of the 
environmentally aware student 
organization EARTH, said that 
we are making great strides in 
environmental education, and our 
environmental research has been 
top-notch for quite some time. 
Architecture, engineering, and 
chemistry are a few of the diverse 
departments with environmental 
influence. The Institute for Green 
Oxidation Chemistry, the Green 
Design Institute, and the Center 
for Integrated Study of the Human 
Dimensions of Global Change are 
a few examples of Carnegie Mellons far-reaching environmental
interests. One of the goals of the 
Institute for Green Oxidation 
Chemistry is to find alternative 
methods for necessary indus
trial processes that produce toxic 
chemicals.
Green practices in campus 
housing help create a lifestyle for 
students, said Michael. Yet green 
practices are not limited to hous
ing. In the near future, students 
can look forward to a number of 
green projects and events. These 
include Carnegie Mellons par
ticipation in the Solar Decathlon, 
tours of green sites on campus, 
and the creation of green roofs 
on a number of campus buildings, 
including Hamerschlag Hall.

attributes, such as knowledge 
about the social world. Sony has 
given some of these humanlike 
attributes to the QRIO by enabling 
it to recognize both the faces and 
the voices of those who have in
troduced themselves  and then 
converse with them in Japanese.
Many are unsure of Sonys 
intentions for the robot. Sure, 
QRIOs cute, but what problem 
does it solve? asked junior ECE 
major Steven Shamlian, vice 
president of the Robotics Club. A 
robot is in general a device that 
works to solve some problem for 
humans  something dangerous, 
dull, or dirty, that people cant or 
dont want to do. Press releases 
have pitched the QRIO as a poten
tial companion or personal assis
tant; but despite all of the hype,
a selling price has not yet been 
declared.
Its purpose is evident in its 
creation, though. Some of its 
body parts have already been tai
lored for closer interaction with 
humans: Its joints are outfitted 
with pinch detection sensors, 
which prevent fingers and hands 
from becoming trapped. Veloso 
is enthusiastic about the QRIOs 
possibility of serving as a com
panion. I really would like them 
to be able to move around, help 
people, and be part of the envi
ronment, she said.
After her success in using So
nys AIBO platform, Veloso hopes 
to acquire a QRIO to conduct re
search. Sony gave me the AIBO 
in 98 to see what kind of research 
could be done with these new 
robots they were developing. What 
became of that has had benefits
for both sides. We benefited from 
having the robots, and ... they got 
tons of development on [them], 
said Veloso. She now shares 
some of what she has learned in 
teaching the class CMRoboBits: 
Creating an Intelligent AIBO Ro
bot, which was conducted for the 
first time in the fall of 2003.
Veloso envisions accomplish
ments with the QRIO similar to 
what she has achieved with the 
AIBO. I believe that if [Sony] 
would give us a QRIO, it would 
have a major benefit for them. It 
could show what the robots could 
do from a research point of view.
In addition to Komiyama and 
Kozukis presentation, software 
development manager John DeCuir and senior sales and market
ing manager Ken Orii will demon
strate the QRIOs capabilities and 
give a technical robotics lecture.

atmosphere, the shuttle descends 
at a shallow angle, effectively 
gliding through the atmosphere 
and reducing friction. Instead of 
using ablative shielding, the shut
tle makes use of many ceramic 
tiles, which absorb energy with 
their high heat capacity.
This carries its own set of 
advantages and disadvantages. 
Because the tiles dont melt over 
the craft as an ablative shield 
would, the shuttles aerodynamics and steering are unaffected. 
Unfortunately, the tiles absorb 
so much heat that the crew cant 
leave for several hours after land
ing, or else the disembarking lad
der would melt. The thousands of 
ceramic tiles also require an ex
haustive inspection routine be
tween launches, taking about 
60 days to replace damaged tiles 
and test the integrity of others. Per
haps most important is the struc
tural integrity of the tiles. As evi
denced by the Columbia accident, 
the loss of several critical tiles can
jeopardize an entire spacecraft. 
This type of damage is unlikely to 
occur in ablative shielding.
Both types of shielding hold 
equally important roles for pres
ent and future reentry vehicles. 
As more advanced research 
probes and manned spacecraft 
are deployed, we may see more 
advanced forms of heat shield
ing, and reentry provides the ul
timate test for them. As they like 
to say in the world of aeronautical 
engineering, If you cant take the 
heat, get out of the atmosphere.

Visions of space come to life 
with images from ESA probe
Our generation lives in a time of un
paralleled discovery. Caked Martian soil 
clings to the wheels of year-old rovers, 
causing them to resemble off-road ve
hicles rather than multi-million dollar 
pieces of cutting edge engineering. Our 
most sensitive electronic eyes relentlessly 
search the sky for other signs of life, 
capturing the image of a planet more 
than 250 light-years away for the first 
time. And now, at last, we have pierced 
Titans mysterious atmosphere. For years, 
hints of water ice on Titans surface and 
the moons impenetrable atmosphere 
taunted scientists and piqued curiosities. 
We should praise the European Space 
Agency for this, a major contribution to 
mankinds pantheon of firsts.
After seven cold, lonely years of travel, 
the intrepid Huygens probe plunged 
through Titans atmosphere, expending 
its short life to tell Earth all about 
the strange place it landed. Titan is a 
world that appears alien, a place where 
methane flows like water and falls like 
rain. The ESA has come a long way since 
December of 2003, when its mission to 
Mars failed badly, leading many to call 
it an embarrassment. In a little-noted 
comment, Robert Griffiths, a professor 
of physics at CMU, said, I think the ESA 
was justifiably elated by the success of 
the landing. Titan is the only satellite in 
the solar system to have an atmosphere.... 
They seem to have gotten incredibly lucky 
to have landed [on solid ground] right 
near a liquid region, otherwise it would 
have sunk right [down]
Perhaps they got lucky with the 
landing, but the engineering excellence 
is there. The reams of data and hundreds 
of images transmitted from the surface 
attest to the ESAs ability to work with
international partners  the first in 
a series of joint ventures with NASA. 
Where the partnership will end up is not 
completely laid out, but we hope it lies on 
a path that will lead humanity to Mars.
The images from Huygens offer us a 
glimpse of a world that sometimes seems 
to be less hostile than our own. Threats 
of dirty bombs, daily deaths of Americans 
far from home, and the horror of natures 
wrath all weigh heavily on our minds.
However, there is always hope for a 
brighter future. Despite the many people 
who spend their days planning and wag
ing war, there are those who sustain and 
feed the curiosity of our species. Without 
these people our lives would be lessened. 
Without them, we would have little re
prieve from various awful circumstances 
that affect our lives on a daily basis.
Missions like Cassini-Huygens will help 
us to answer the big questions: the ones 
that come to us when we peer into the 
speckled night sky. Are we special in the 
universe, or are we galactic flukes? Can 
there be others like us?
So, please, thank a scientist. Their work 
allows us to ponder bold new thoughts 
and allows us to expand our conception 
of the world around us, in both its work
ings and its meaning. In his most recent 
book, celebrated physicist Brian Greene 
summed up this ability in a few choice 
words: "... the men and women of sci
ence ... have peeled back layer after layer 
of the cosmic onion, enigma by enigma, 
and revealed a universe that is at once 
surprising, unfamiliar, exciting, elegant, 
and thoroughly unlike what anyone ever 
expected. We should keep them from 
toiling in obscurity and bring them and 
their work into the public consciousness, 
expanding the possibilities of thought.
Students cheated out of hard 
earned money by payroll tax
Most student workers feel a certain 
sense of satisfaction in receiving their first 
paycheck of the year. Imagine, however, 
that after putting in all that work, you 
receive nothing on your pay day. Its not 
an administrative mix-up or a mistake. 
Its because Pittsburgh has just raised its 
occupational tax by over 400 percent, 
and student workers have paid the brunt 
of it by having the tax deducted in its 
entirety from their first pay of 2005.
For many students in part-time or 
work-study jobs, the deduction of the 
new occupational tax, now $52, can 
completely wipe out their paychecks. 
Previously, the citys occupational 
tax was a mere $10. However, due to 
Pittsburghs myriad financial problems, 
the tax, now ominously named the 
Emergency and Municipal Services 
(EMS) tax, has been raised to supplement 
Pittsburghs new budget, which is already 
scrimping on police and fire service and 
infrastructure.
The EMS tax allows for those who make 
less than $12,000 a year to file for a $42 
return at the end of the year. Realistically, 
though, students who go home for the 
summer or who do not maintain a job for 
extended periods of time will probably 
fail to file the appropriate paperwork.
As the likelihood of any student making 
more than $12,000 is small, it is not fair 
to subject students to the EMS tax. After 
all, most students are not even residents 
of Pittsburgh. As students, we already 
pay enormous amounts of money for 
tuition, room and board and textbooks; 
it is ridiculous to ask us to give up the 
little money we have made working in the
scant free time we own. The city should 
take into consideration whom they are 
taxing and be conscientious when taxing 
low-income students. Carnegie Mellon 
should be aware of this, too, and would 
do well to consider subsidizing the cost 
for those students who would otherwise 
be unable to afford it.
Within the year, students will find 
themselves fighting once again to keep 
the bus services that are vital in the lives 
of students and other Pittsburgh workers. 
Fire and police services are already in 
short supply across the city. While we 
should help to support the city in which 
we live, we shouldnt carry the weight of 
its financial irresponsibility.
The tax was sudden enough that it left 
even the Universitys Payroll Services at 
a loss. Payroll was unable to restructure 
their deduction schedule to accommo
date students needs given the immediate 
instantiation of the tax. Although the tax 
is not terribly large, students who depend 
on their paychecks in full for off-campus 
housing, grocery bills or school expenses 
will find themselves empty-handed and 
at a loss for a good portion of January, 
and perhaps even later.
It isnt fair to say that college stu
dents at Carnegie Mellon or elsewhere 
shouldnt be responsible in any way to 
support the city in which they live. Its 
our obligation to help this city, whether 
through consumer activity, discussion, or 
volunteering. However, the city should 
not put its students at a disadvantage. 
The sudden occupational tax will take 
its toll on Carnegie Mellon and student 
workers, and a heavy one at that.

Danielle Saudino/Art EditorDowntowns second renaissance in spotlight
Adam Greenberg
Strolling on Fifth Avenue downtown, 
you might take note of the three depart
ment stores anchoring Pittsburghs socalled central business district. Well, 
its not so much three as one, with the 
erstwhile Lazarus and Lord & Taylor 
having closed over the last year. Surely, 
though, the venerable Kaufmanns name 
will remain indefinitely as the symbol of 
downtown retail commerce.
Not so, actually: The latest projections 
have the Kaufmanns name disappearing 
entirely from western Pennsylvania and 
New York after an announcement of a 
buyout offer by Federated Department 
Stores, owners of Macys. The loss of 
the 130-year-old name is just the latest 
blow among the citys repeatedly failed 
attempts to revitalize a downtown 
plagued by suburban sprawl and 
pockmarked by empty and underused 
buildings.
Over eight years ago, Mayor Tom 
Murphy (D) started working on the first 
Fifth-Forbes plan, a plan that had the 
city paying for two-thirds of the then 
new but already defunct Lazarus store 
at Fifth and Wood. The city also bought 
many nearby properties but drew 
protests when it threatened to demolish 
60 of them to build big box retailers: 
impersonal franchises that would lend 
no uniqueness to downtown. Many 
of the companies wooed by the city 
have settled instead at the Homestead 
Waterfront or South Side Works, 
while Nordstrom, the Seattle-based 
department store, has abandoned their 
exiguously defined plans to enter the
Pittsburgh market.
A new plan involves thousands of resi
dential units along Fifth Avenue and be
tween Fifth and Forbes, some fronting 
on the citys historic diamond, Market 
Square. Retail and hotel projects have 
taken a backseat to residential ones this 
time around.
Enter Carl Dranoff. On Thursday, 
the city reworked its Fifth-Forbes plan 
again, this time to formally add Philadel
phia residential developer Carl Dranoff 
to the mix of planners taking part in the 
corridor development. Dranoff is the 
successful developer of many condo
minium properties in Center City and 
University City, Philadelphia. He has 
been working with the citys ad hoc de
velopment committee since June.
A key characteristic of his company, 
Dranoff Properties, is that it converts 
extant historic buildings and continues 
to operate all the facilities it develops. 
Dranoff is among those responsible for 
turning University City  home to the 
University of Pennsylvania and Drexel 
University  from a crime-riddled 
neighborhood into a community that 
is to Philadelphia as Cambridge is to 
Boston. The historic conversions have 
gained quick approval from community 
and historic preservation groups. This 
is the difference that will finally get 
the project approved as the city council 
pushes the corridor and the completion 
of Pittsburghs Renaissance II back 
into the spotlight this year.
Dranoff is also committed to serving 
the community around the buildings his 
company converts. The city expects that 
there will be retail fronts on the ground 
floors of the residential buildings on 
Fifth and Liberty Avenues, replacing 
decrepit, failing businesses. PNC, the 
Pittsburgh-based financial corporation,
is the corridors largest remaining prop
erty owner, except for the city; to this 
end they announced Friday that they 
will support this newest plan for their 
corner of the city by making some of 
their twelve properties available for de
velopment if the plan comes to fruition.
Pittsburgh has one of the oldest pop
ulations in the United States at a time 
when many cities are experiencing 
downtown residential booms as young 
professionals and childless couples 
move in. Pittsburgh heretofore has had 
neither the housing nor the drive for 
these demographics to return to the 
business district. Drawing them with 
this residential and light-commercial 
community within a city solves one of 
those two issues; Pittsburghers taking 
pride in their downtown should fill the 
units handily.
A formal proposal from Dranoff and 
Pittsburghs Downtown Partnership is 
expected within a couple weeks. It may 
also include final disposal of the Lazarus 
building by subdivision; watching his 
companys success in Philly, it is certain 
to be the final plan needed in any case. 
Murphy has decided not to seek a fourth 
term partly on the basis of his FifthForbes failure, and the city of Pittsburgh 
is in financial despair and unable to 
subsidize development any further: 
What can finally solve the Fifth-Forbes 
question is an outside developer who 
lacks quixotic ideas but who possesses 
the capital power to make his plans 
happen.

The story of the Dibner Institute and Burndy Library 
possibly coming to Pittsburgh is even more relevant than you 
mention in CMU and Pitt woo trustees of renowned Newton 
collection (January 17, 2005). Dibner family founder Bern 
Dibner was a friend of Henry Posner Sr. who, with his wife 
Ida, is remembered on the Carnegie Mellon campus in the 
Posner Center, a gift to the university from Henry Posner 
Jr. and Helen Posner. Posner Center houses the remarkable 
Posner rare book collection. When Dibner Institute and 
Burndy Library visitors saw the Posner collections first 
edition of Newtons Principia, they were awed.
Henry Posner Sr. came to Pittsburgh in 1912 and soon 
founded the Alpha Claude Neon Corporation, the first firm 
to license neon. Soon, Posner had subsumed his rivals in the 
Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Company. His personal pas
sion was book collecting. At first, he collected fine literature 
and bindings, but after he read Bern Dibners Heralds of Sci
ence, he began to collect books from that list.
Si
Henry Posner Sr. and Bern Dibners shared interest in col
lecting rare history of science titles made them friends but also 
rivals when a rare title was on the market. Bern kept trying to 
convince Henry to deposit his collection somewhere in New 
England, but Henry wanted to maintain it here in Pittsburgh 
for his children and grandchildren. Now the Dibner family is 
looking for an alternative location for Berns collection.
The Posner family has invited the Dibner family to have 
dinner with them in the Posner Center in the spring. I hope 
that the Tartan will soon be able to report to students on this 
next step towards bringing the Institute and the Library to 
Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, students can view most volumes in 
the Posner collection in digitized form at posner.library.cmu.

Student apathy works 
against CMUs morale
In his speech on Martin Luther King 
Day, CMU student Thomas Oliver 
criticized students because we do not 
stand up and take action even when 
we know it is the right thing to do. We 
have no difficulty noticing problems, 
but when it comes time to form a plan 
or take action, everyone quietly steps 
back, waiting for someone else to take 
initiative.
Students at Carnegie Mellon like to 
complain. Whether discussing dining, 
coursework, or tuition, nobody seems 
to be happy with the way things are, 
and everybody likes to blame the ad
ministration. In some cases, this dis
content is well grounded. Even when 
there is agreement between students 
and administrators, it takes far too long 
for anyone to act. For example, Muslim 
students still have no proper designated 
place to pray on campus.
However, student inaction is equally 
responsible for many problems on 
campus. Several student advisory 
councils have folded, and the staffing 
problems on the Activities Board have 
led to accusations of unfair bias. Student 
apathy sets a very poor example for the 
administration to follow. Students have 
not demanded increased efforts toward 
a more diverse campus in response to 
the Diversity Advisory Council annual 
report. Students have not made serious 
attempts to bridge the divisions that 
still separate artists from engineers, 
graduate students from undergraduates, 
Greeks from non-Greeks, and American 
students from international.
As a member of Student Senate, I 
must say that last semester, we were not 
as proactive as we should have been. 
Senate has spent far too much time 
waiting for issues to arise rather than 
actively seeking student input. Solutions 
either stagnate in Senate committees or 
stall within some level of the adminis
tration. Student government and the
administration need to work together 
to devise a more efficient way of doing 
business.
Even if this is achieved, my fellow 
Senators and I still cannot do everything 
ourselves. If you see something that 
needs to be done, take the initiative. Fol
low your passions to make this campus 
what you want it to be. We may not be 
able to solve every problem, but surely 
we can accomplish much more if we all 
realize our passions.
English philosopher Herbert Spencer 
wrote, The great aim of education is 
not knowledge but action. Our time at 
Carnegie Mellon is not just a quest for 
raw facts and skills. It is an opportunity 
to listen to Olivers speech and stand up. 
Student government and the administra
tion need to set a good example, but the 
rest of the campus needs to follow. If you 
see something that needs to be done, do 
it. If you do not know how to proceed, 
talk to your Senators or Dean Murphy. 
If we all do our part, we can make this 
great institution even better.

THE TARTAN  JANUARY 24, 2005
Affirmative action fails to acknowledge minorities talents and skill
Alexander Su
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, 
I was flipping through the TV 
channels when I saw Rev. Jesse 
Jackson on the air. A news show 
host asked Rev. Jackson whether 
Dr. Kings statement  I have 
a dream that my four little chil
dren will one day live in a nation 
where they will not be judged by 
the color of their skin but by the 
content of their character  is 
contradictory to current affirma
tive action practices.
Rev. Jacksons response was 
a definite no, that the United 
States racist policies of over 
three hundred years of slavery 
were proof that it was not. That 
was when it dawned on me that 
the debate between pro- and 
anti-affirmative action groups 
is caused by a fundamental 
problem: Americans have very 
little understanding of the 
extremely complex reasons 
why certain minorities are so 
underrepresented in American 
higher education institutions.
When we think about contro
versial issues such as affirmative 
action, we must be reminded 
that there is more to this argu
ment than simply a black/white 
dichotomy. Affirmative action 
seeks to benefit minorities who 
attend higher education institu
tions at lower proportions than 
majority counterparts. However, 
one subgroup of minorities that 
do not receive benefits are AsianAmericans. Asian-Americans are 
overrepresented in colleges and 
universities across the United 
States.
I do admit that that my views 
are partly motivated because I am 
an Asian-American and because 
I do have a stake in the issue. 
Achieving admission to any pres
tigious law, medical, or business 
school is a zero-sum game  
every spot given to a less qualified 
underrepresented minority is one 
taken away from a more qualified 
white or Asian-American appli
cant. However, the question that 
bears attention is not whether my 
arguments are based on selfish 
reasons, but whether my points 
are valid. I strongly believe that 
the aspiration for equality trumps 
selfish agendas.
In 1965, a policy was created 
requiring government contractors 
to use affirmative action in order 
to hire a representative amount 
of specific racial minorities. Since 
then, this rule has moved into, 
among other areas, the realm
of undergraduate and graduate 
school admission.
To say that the issue of affirma
tive action is controversial is an 
understatement; there have been 
countless court cases on the topic 
that have been argued all the way 
to the United States Supreme 
Court (Grutter v. Bollinger and 
Bakke v. University of California). 
Advocates of racial preferences 
contend that there are two main 
reasons why it is important to 
keep these policies: first, some 
subgroups face inherent handi
caps in obtaining higher educa
tion because of race; and second, 
education is the solution to many 
of the problems facing these racial 
subgroups. The latter is more 
convincing: most of us agree that 
education is paramount to suc
cess in our country. It is the for
mer argument that is erroneous. 
Underrepresented minorities are 
not disadvantaged in academic 
performance because of the color 
of their skin.
A few of you might be think
ing, Some minorities face a rela
tively large number of obstacles 
in attaining higher education. 
It is true that in general, various 
minorities face daily struggles 
such as poverty at a higher rate 
than others.
However, we must be care
ful to distinguish the difference 
between correlation and causa
tion. While there may be a cor
relation between some social 
problems and being an underrep
resented minority, we cannot say 
that these problems are caused by 
the color of their skin. By institut
ing programs to reward people 
solely on the criterion of race, a 
sort of skepticism arises about the 
capabilities of underrepresented 
minorities.
Another argument, champi
oned by many political leaders, 
including Rev. Jackson, is that 
affirmative action policies are 
necessary as a compensation for 
years of racist policies. This is 
a very awkward claim. The sole 
purpose of policies of racial pref
erence is to help achieve and 
maintain equality. To turn them 
into some sort of payment would 
defeat their original purpose. 
However, the compensation ar
gument is hard to argue against 
because it is so highly politicized.
The solution to all these prob
lems is hardly a simple one. 
However, until people start ask
ing real, hard questions, we will 
never achieve an understanding 
of the problems faced by minority 
communities. How is it that other 
minorities, such as Jewish and 
Asian-Americans, have flocked
in large numbers to universities 
and colleges despite historically 
racist policies? I am not saying 
that there is an easy answer, but 
it is vital that we achieve a bet
ter understanding of the problem 
before we attempt to solve it. We 
cannot expect to find an answer 
if we do not even know what the 
proper question is.
And finally, we cannot afford 
to view such issues in black and 
white. A common misconception 
is that affirmative action policies 
help underrepresented minorities 
and that a lack of support for 
said policies means that we do 
not care about egalitarianism. In 
fact, racial preferences hurt those 
people they intend to help because 
they attempt to cover up and mask 
serious underlying problems 
facing the beneficiaries.
Affirmative action is a short
term solution to a long-term 
problem. This is not a new con
cept: In 1865, Frederick Douglass 
said, And if [he] cannot stand on 
his own legs, let him fall also. All I 
ask is, give him a chance to stand 
on his own legs!
Alexander Su (asu@) is a senior 
social and decision science major. 
His main goal is to promote discus
sion about affirmative action. He

EA Games monopolizes sports video games industry
Evan Sundwick
It doesnt seem so long ago 
that Microsoft was being hit 
with monopoly accusations and 
anticompetitive business prac
tices suits. However, we live in 
different times  the Microsoft 
monopolys sun is slowly setting. 
Internet Explorer, Microsofts 
web browser, is for the first time 
actually losing droves of users to 
free alternatives such as Mozilla 
Firefox. The companys strangle
hold on computer operating sys
tems is loosening ever so slightly 
as many major businesses move 
to Linux as a stable, secure work
station environment. Meanwhile, 
longtime rival Apple Computer is 
leveraging the phenomenal suc
cess of its iPod family of digital 
music players to sell record num
bers of new systems using the 
companys homegrown Mac OS X 
operating system. The crown for 
the most questionable and despi
cable software monopoly is now 
descending upon the head of the 
worlds largest independent video 
game publisher: Electronic Arts.
One of Electronic Arts most no
table franchises is the explosively 
popular Madden football series. 
Football video games are one of 
the most lucrative genres in the 
business: at least half of current 
console owners (Playstation 2, 
Xbox, and Gamecube) are likely 
playing Madden, and they reliably 
buy the latest version every year. 
Such has been the pattern for the 
past decade of gamers. Madden is 
the dominant title in the genre, 
and, for many people, it has be
come synonymous with football 
titles in general.
It is easy to understand EA 
Sports anxiety, then, about Sega 
Sports. Since 2000, Sega has been 
releasing its own football series. 
The NFL 2K franchise has been
gaining popularity, and in 2003 
Sega gained a license from ESPN 
to use the networks resources 
in the game. ESPN NFL 2K5, the 
latest iteration of the series, was 
the third best selling game for the 
Playstation 2 and Xbox in 2004, 
selling 1.5 million copies and 1.0 
million copies respectively. EA 
Sports Madden 2005 was in front 
of Segas effort on the PS2, but 
the Xbox version wasnt even on 
the radar of 2004s top ten.
Part of Segas success this year 
came from an aggressive pricing 
policy. Video games normally re
tail for fifty dollars. However, this 
year Sega announced that all its 
sports titles would be priced at 20
spond to having one of its favorite 
genres pushed around? By com
pletely eliminating all possible 
competition. On December 13, 
Electronic Arts signed a deal with 
the National Football League to 
have rights for an exclusive NFL 
license for five years. Such a deal 
means that no other game de
veloper can make a game using 
NFL teams, NFL players, or NFL 
stadiums  period.
As if that werent enough, on 
January 17, Electronic Arts signed 
a fifteen year deal with ESPN to 
have access to all of the networks 
resources. Electronic Arts has 
used its market capital (at over a 
$15.5 billion market cap, it is the
EA is considered, a pattern starts 
to appear. On December 20, EA 
announced that it had purchased 
a 19.9 percent stake in Ubisoft, 
a France-based game company. 
Ubisoft holds the licenses to 
many of the most popular game 
franchises of the past five years, 
including all of the Tom Clancy 
games, the Prince of Persia series, 
the Myst series, and the Rayman 
series.
Ubisoft announced a press 
release the same day, saying they 
considered the purchase hostile 
and were willing to fight EA if they 
ever attempted to purchase the 
company outright. The deal is still 
waiting for antitrust authorization
dollars at release. This of course 
gave them a significant edge over 
Electronic Arts, whose sports 
games were all priced at the reg
ular launch price. The ensuing 
price delta, along with high criti
cal praise, allowed Sega to take a 
significant chunk of EAs market 
share.
So how did Electronic Arts refifth largest software company in 
the world) to eliminate all com
petition in what was becoming a 
very competitive genre, and has 
also crippled most of Segas sports 
lineup by taking away their brand 
recognition.
These moves are alarming in 
their own right, but when some 
of the other recent news about
by the U.S. government.
As if hostile takeovers werent 
enough, Electronic Arts has re
cently come under scrutiny for 
mistreatment of its employees. 
On November 10, an anonymous 
source posted an essay online 
about her experience as the wife 
of an EA employee. The source, 
ea_spouse, told horror stories
of twelve-hour workdays, six days 
a week, with meager pay and the 
ever-looming threat of poor job 
security. Most development com
panies experience work sched
ules like this as the ship date of a 
game nears; however, Electronic 
Arts kept its development teams 
in a state of permanent crunch, 
even when the release date was 
months away. Shortly after the 
accusations came out, it was re
vealed that many EA employees 
were preparing a class-action 
lawsuit against Electronic Arts for 
not receiving overtime pay.
Randy Pausch, a professor of 
human-computer interaction at 
Carnegie Mellon, spent the spring 
2004 semester at Electronic Arts. 
I would say that [long hours 
were] a concern, not a complaint, 
with most people I spoke directly 
with, said Pausch. To a larger 
point, I think that EA is a bit like 
Microsoft: its a very aggressive, 
very young corporate culture 
that can best be described as play 
hard or go home.  Pausch has de
scribed EA as a ruthless meritoc
racy, whose corporate philoso
phy regards a late game release as 
a dire misdeed.
As Electronic Arts continues to 
gobble up smaller studios, adding 
their intellectual property to the 
companys already vast portfolio, 
hopefully someone in the Depart
ment of Justice will take a long 
look at the company. Electronic 
Arts has announced intentions to 
become a household name on the 
magnitude of Disney; their prac
tices to get to that goal, however, 
may not be very scrupulous. The 
best way to keep Electronic Arts 
in check is to vote with your wal
lets  as a business, theyll have 
to listen to that.

The Tartan is a student newspaper at 
Carnegie Mellon University, funded in part

Womens basketball falls 
to the Chicago Maroons

Tartan junior Rebecca Shore dribbles around Chicagos Jennifer Kaiser.

Sports Editor
The womens basketball 
team suffered another set
back Friday night, losing to the 
University of Chicago Maroons 
32-75. It was the Tartans fifth 
consecutive home loss, drop
ping them to 4-11 overall and 
0-4 in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA). Chicago 
guard Korry Schwanz led all 
scorers with 23 points, while 
senior forward Lisa Seacat led 
the Tartans with 13 points and 
eight rebounds.
Without starting point guards 
Ashley Mazziota and Leah Feola, 
Carnegie Mellon had a difficult 
time containing Chicagos freeshooting guards, as the Maroons 
hit five three-pointers in the first 
seven minutes of the game to 
jump out to an early 23-2 lead. 
The Maroons never looked back 
from there, holding the Tartans 
to only eight points on 15 per
cent shooting while converting 
50 percent of their shots from 
the field. At the half, Chicago 
led 45-8.
Chicago is a good team, but 
a lot of the problem was on our 
side. We ran our offense well, we 
were getting a lot of open looks, 
we just werent hitting our shots, 
said Seacat. Unfortunately, they 
(Chicago) were shooting lights 
out.
The Tartans came out stronger 
in the second half, with Seacat 
scoring 11 of her 13 points in the 
period, including a big threepointer to jump-start the Tartans. 
Sophomore guard Nora Darcher 
also played a big role in the
period, scoring five points, grab
bing four rebounds and adding 
two steals. Both the defense and 
offense responded, as Carnegie 
Mellon held the Maroons to only 
36 percent shooting in the last 
20 minutes.
Chicago is a solid team. 
They play tough defense, said 
Mazziota, who missed the game 
with a torn ACL. Injuries have 
been difficult for the team 
because we lost two point guards
 both starters at the time of 
our injuries. She was referring 
to Feola, who took over at the 
point when Mazziota went down, 
but was sidelined with the same 
injury only weeks later.
Its a significant problem 
because now there are only nine 
girls who can play. Since we dont 
have the depth of other teams 
in the conference we arent as 
rested, which may become a fac
tor as we play conference games 
Friday nights and Sunday after
noons. It also means that we 
cant go five-on-five in practices, 
said Mazziota. However, the way 
the team has bounced back from 
these setbacks has been encour
aging. The team is doing a good 
job to fill the [absent] spots  
its incredible how much theyve 
improved since the injuries.
The womens team remains 
hopeful despite a difficult con
ference schedule. The UAA had 
three nationally ranked schools
 New York, Rochester, and 
Brandeis Universities  and two 
more highly regarded teams in 
Johns Hopkins and Washington 
and Jefferson Universities. The 
Tartans hosted 13-2 Washington 
on Sunday and will travel to 
3-10 Emory this Friday.
Mens basketball pushes past Chicago
by Akil Simon
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Tartans 
are quickly advancing through the 
ranks after a Friday win over the 
University of Chicago Maroons 
catapulted them to the top of the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) standings. The Tartans 
now stand at 12-2 overall for 
the season with an unbeaten 4-0 
record in the UAA.
The game started off in favor 
of the Tartans, who sprang out to 
an early 8-2 lead; how'ever, the 
Maroons quickly countered with a 
12-2 run. Both teams exchanged 
the lead several times in the 
first half of play. The Tartans 
pulled away twice, leading by 
six, but were unable to maintain 
that edge going into the second 
half. The Maroons Brandon 
Woodhead (Lincoln, Neb.) hit 
a two pointer with 1:50 left in 
the first half, giving Chicago a 
34-32 lead. They were able to 
maintain this margin over the 
Tartans through the remainder 
of the half and took a 37-35 lead 
into halftime.
Excitement continued into the 
second half, in which the game 
saw five lead changes. Junior A.J. 
Straub (St. Marys, Pa.) delivered 
the final shift in momentum by 
draining a shot from behind the 
three-point arc to give the Tartans 
a 67-66 lead with 5:31 left in 
regulation. The Tartans used this 
opportunity to pull away from the
Maroons, going on to an 81-72 
victory.
Coach Anthony Wingen was 
pleased with the Tartans perfor
mance on Friday night. The sta
tistics reveal the intensity of the 
game, but this was not news to 
Wingen, who had the team pre
paring themselves for the emo
tional contest during the week 
prior. Wingen stated, Being tied 
with Chicago for first in the UAA 
meant that both teams had a lot 
on the line in this contest. The 
impressive results produced by 
the Tartan players are an indica
tion of their emotional investment 
in the success of their team.
Four of the Tartan players 
recorded double figures as junior 
Nate Maurer (Pittsburgh, Pa.) led 
the pack with a game high of 
28 points. Junior Clayton BarlowWilcox (Brookline, Mass.) made 
his contribution with 15 points 
and senior Eliot Goren (Silver 
Spring, Md.) finished with 
13 points. Senior Michael Divens 
(Trafford, Pa.) recorded his 
fourth double-double of the sea
son, pulling down 11 boards and 
scoring 11 points as well.
The Tartans head out on the 
road this weekend to face Emory 
and Case Western Reserve. These 
games will be a challenge for the 
Tartans. As Coach Wingen was 
the first to emphasize: There 
are no easy games in the UAA. 
Regardless of the outcome, the 
Tartans return home on the week
end of February 4 to face these 
teams one last time.

Eagles soar; Steelersfall in conference contests
by Erik Michaels-Ober
Staffwriter
There is little doubt that the 
best team won in both conference 
championship games on Sun
day. The Philadelphia Eagles and 
New England Patriots definitively 
showed that they deserve to play 
in Super Bowl XXXIX, where they 
will face each other in Jackson
ville, Florida.
The Eagles finally get their 
chance to demonstrate that they 
are the best team in the league, 
after failing to win the past three 
NFC championship games. Their 
defense shut down the Atlanta 
Falcons running game, and 
caused Michael Vick to throw a 
crucial interception in the third 
quarter. They also held the 
speedy quarterback to only 26
yards rushing, and zero yards af
ter the first half. The big question 
for Philadelphia now is whether 
star wide receiver Terrell Owens 
will be healthy enough to play in 
the Super Bowl after injuring his 
ankle five weeks ago. Dr. Mark 
Myerson, who performed surgery 
on Owens ankle on Decem
ber 22, has not ruled it out, and 
if Owens sideline antics in yester
days game were any indication, I 
would count on him playing for at 
least some of the game on Febru
ary 6. Owens leadership on the 
field could be a difference-maker 
for the Eagles.
In the later game, New England 
got off to a quick 10-0 lead off of 
Pittsburgh turnovers and never 
trailed, handing the Steelers their 
first home loss of the season and 
avenging a 34-20 loss on Hallow
een. The Patriots defense forced
Ben Roethlisberger to throw 
three interceptions  including 
one that was run back eightyseven yards for a touchdown by 
Rodney Harrison  making him 
look like the rookie that he is. In 
fact, almost every pass Roethlis
berger threw looked like it could 
have been intercepted, with second-year cornerback Asante Sam
uel getting his hands on many 
of Big Bens passes. He clearly 
lacked the poise of Tom Brady, 
who will try to lead his team to 
their third Super Bowl victory in 
four years.
Despite this tough loss, Steelers
fans should not give up hope for 
the future. Roethlisberger will 
likely improve in the off-season 
after a phenomenal first year, and 
even if Jerome Bettis retires after 
this game, the Steelers ground 
game will remain strong with 
Duce Staley and the up-andcoming Verron Haynes. Even 
stronger is the teams defense, 
led by young Pro Bowlers Troy 
Polamolu and Joey Porter. With 
a front office that consistently 
drafts well and promotes growth 
within the organization, the Steel
ers will be a force to be reckoned 
with for seasons to come.

Colorful cabaret by CLO
Forever Plaid exudes energy with skilled director and cast
Theres apparently a theater district hidden 
somewhere in downtown Pittsburgh. So cultural 
aficionados will find when they visit the CLO 
Cabaret. The bright lights and glitz give the area 
the feel of Broadway, but the show title seems 
unlikely for such a grand location: Forever Plaid.
There is no real plot to Forever Plaid. Four friends 
are in a barbershop-quartet singing group. 
Theyre driving in a van on their way to some 
unspectacular gig, when suddenly they are hit by 
a school bus full of children. While the children 
all escape without a scratch, the quartet is killed. 
This entire narrative is told by voice-over in the 
first two minutes of the production. The only 
people on stage are a huge, Italian-looking bass 
player, and a cranky middle-aged woman playing 
a piano.
From the shadowy depths of the stage come four 
figures holding candles: the lost quartet, back to 
do their one big show. So now, forty-one years 
after the demise of the quartet, the audience 
at the CLO Cabaret is in for the production of a 
lifetime  quite literally. And is it spectacular? 
Well, yes and no.
The acting, singing, and choreography in Forever 
Plaid are all extremely impressive. The actors 
who play the members of the quartet remain 
onstage for the entire production. They carry the 
show with their voices, dancing, and energy. As 
the audience learns about each member, the play 
provides comedy, tragedy, and a few surprises.
The comedic element is continuous, beginning 
with the quartet members names: Jinx, Frankie, 
Sparky, and Smudge. Nosebleeds, asthma, 
plaid tuxedos, and a Spanish number all make 
their way into Forever Plaid. The Plaids, as they 
called themselves, even venture into the crowd, 
incorporating an audience member into a piano 
duet.
Each actor brings personality and an on-stage 
presence to their quirky characters, as well. 
J.D. Daw plays the sad, tall Jinx so effortlessly 
that when he uses Jinxs true power and voice, 
the contrast brings loud applause. Marcus 
Stevens is the zaniest, playing Sparky, a kooky 
character who gets so excited that he bounces 
around the stage like a Mexican jumping bean. 
Adam Halpin is solid as the leader and calmest 
member, Frankie. And finally, Joe Domencic plays
Smudge to a T; he expertly portrays the baritone 
crooner with the thick Buddy Holly glasses. The 
play works because of the chemistry between its 
actors. Indeed, they seem like the real Plaids.
Unfortunately, the play itself is centered mostly 
around 50s and 60s pop culture. This is 
especially true of the comedy. There is a clear 
older minority who enjoy the jokes more than 
some of the younger audience members, who sit 
with blank smiles on their faces wondering what 
theyre missing. This culminates in a rendition of 
the entire run of the Ed Sullivan show. Clearly, 
for those who were not around to see most of the 
episodes, the jokes go a bit over their heads. The 
dialogue also drags the pace of the show in places, 
and the song performances, while beautiful 
to watch and listen to, get a bit repetitive and 
tiresome by the finale.
Despite this, director Guy Stroman should stand 
up and take a bow for his work on this production. 
There are so many elements that could have failed 
completely and pulled down the entire energy 
level. Yet his direction and choreography keep the 
mediocre script playing on a high plane all night. 
Deana Muro, the musical director, should also be 
applauded for her work. She even doubles as the 
Plaids disgruntled piano player. Justin Bendel 
handles the bass masterfully and is perfect for the 
part. Jason Coll, the associate artistic director, is 
a graduate of the College of Fine Arts. Andrew 
David Ostrowskis lighting matches every jump, 
jive, and beat of the Plaids performance, making 
it seem as though there is a real rock-and-roll 
show on the stage.
The posh lounge feeling of the cabaret theater 
also increases the shows authenticity. For those 
unfamiliar with the cabaret experience, it is 
striking: upon handing your ticket to the usher, 
you are guided to a bar with a full kitchen where 
you can take any food item into show with you. 
The seating is half cocktail-lounge tables and half 
theater seating with table ledges at each place. 
There are menus, waitresses, and an overall 
feeling of luxury and affluence, making the 
Cabaret at the Pittsburgh CLO a very classy place 
to spend an evening. Forever Plaid runs through 
February. It is definitely worth the experience.

Amorphic Robot Works mixes fact with the fantastic
Robot designer to speak at Carnegie Mellon on Thursday
Popular culture has been fascinated by robots for 
decades. In the 1950s a robot was a quintessential tin 
man, looking like a Neanderthal in a suit  most likely 
because in the movies, there usually was someone in 
there. As technology has changed, though, the common 
perception of robots has become more complex. Movies 
now depict robots as a wide variety of creatures, replete 
with teeming masses of wires and mechanical parts. 
Chico MacMurtrie, the artistic director of a group of 
artists who call themselves Amorphic Robot Works, has 
taken advantage of this image and is bridging the gap 
between the public conception of robots and the artistic 
world.
With more than a hundred creations powered by a 
combinationofpneumaticsandcomputer-actuatedservos, 
the audience can experience the raw emotion involved 
with lifelike machines. Mark Ruch, MacMurtries tour 
manager, explains on the groups website that there is a 
beauty and elegance in movement itself, [and] there is an 
equally potent experience in watching a machine (human 
or organic in form), struggling to stand, attempting to 
throw a rock, or playing a drum.
This week, Pittsburghers will be able to take part in the 
experience described by Ruch. On Friday, the Wood
Street Galleries downtown will open an exhibition 
devoted to Amorphic Robot Works. The two centerpieces 
of the exhibit will be The Cave of the Subconscious and 
Too Big Dog Monkey. The Cave of the Subconscious 
footprint measures 30 feet by 15 feet  and it houses 
more than 24 unique interactive sculptures, as well as its 
own power source and lighting  making it completely 
self-contained.
All the machines are controlled via a modified MIDI 
controller running on Macintosh computers. In several 
cases, the machines are actually designed with the 
capabilities and limitations of the controller in mind. 
The design of the machines is an intensive process. 
MacMurtrie begins by carving drawings and doodles into 
his desk while otherwise occupied, and then from those 
carvings he sculpts the machines and imbues them with 
personality.
Before the gallery opening on Friday, MacMurtrie will be 
speaking at Carnegie Mellon on Thursday in McConomy 
Auditorium. Starting at 5 pm, MacMurtrie will discuss 
his art and the current display at the Wood Street 
Galleries. The work is an ongoing endeavor to uncover 
the primacy of movement and sound, MacMurtrie said. 
Each machine is inspired or influenced both by modern
society and [by] what I physically experience and sense. 
The whole of this input informs my ideas and work.
The exhibit runs through March 19. For more

Full Blown Chaos CD, Wake the Demons, remains true to the rage that the band provokes live
For me to review a band in this column, it has to be 
one that adds something to the genres I love. By and 
large, all of todays true metal bands can play their 
instruments well, arrange songs, and inject fury into their 
presentation. Full Blown Chaos is no exception, playing 
taut, bad-ass metal-core that satisfies their audience. 
However, seeing them live is the real test  and in this 
case, its an experience that I wont soon forget.
Thinking back to their show at the World last year, I felt 
that the scene was more Fight Club than everyday metal 
concert. As they plugged in, FBC proceeded to unleash a 
storm of fury that was fed back in spades by the audience. 
Watching the floor explode with rage was a sight for sore 
eyes: everyday moshing descended into spin-kicks, and 
the normal boundary surrounding the pit grew larger, its 
radius extending almost to the bar at the rear. Preventing 
patrons from simply sipping Cokes and nodding their 
heads, the enveloping anger either dragged them into the 
pit or expelled them unceremoniously to the back walls
of the club. To summon such enmity takes talent! To drag 
out and help release all the frustration in every concertgoer, to have them act in unity is perhaps the goal of any 
rock star. Some try and get pissed off at the lackluster 
response, and maybe even berate the odd audience 
member (Axl, anyone?). Not these guys.
Its that teetering, on-the-edge-and-looking-over feel 
that brings rock and roll alive. That need for stimulation 
and release is what rock is all about. Walking into a 
show and not knowing what could happen  absolute 
transcendence or full blown chaos  is what keeps 
my fascination in music. It is what propels otherwise 
ordinary bands to the stratosphere of rocks elite. It is 
what separates the Doors of this world from the Third 
Eye Blinds.
The trouble with a rabid response like this is that word 
of mouth spreads and the audience only gets larger. The 
chance to say I saw them when... gets slimmer. If you
want to at least hear what youre missing, grab a copy of 
the album; it just came out within the last few months 
and comes with a bonus DVD of videos from FBC and 
labelmates like Hatebreed and Sworn Enemy, among 
others.
Before I go, I would like to dedicate this weeks article to 
the memory of Danny Sugarman. Fans of his will surely 
recognize his influence on my writing style. Though not 
everyone loved his work, no one can deny his passion 
for the art of rock n roll. I was saddened to hear of his 
passing this month; the world of rock journalism has lost 
a giant. For some of his best stuff, check out Appetite For 
Destruction (GNR) and No One Here Gets Out Alive 
(The Doors).

Mekons Heaven and Hell spans alt-country to punk
Diehard fans and newcomers alike will delight in this solid hits CD
A Mekons greatest hits collection would seem to be a 
no-brainer. The band arguably has the most dedicated 
fan base of any band I know, most of whom would argue 
that the Mekons are one of the greatest bands of recent 
history. That's even a bit of an understatement; I'd wager 
they'd argue that the Mekons are the greatest thing of 
all time. In general, pushy fans tend to make me transfer 
my annoyance to the artists, and I frequently find myself 
saying things such as I dont hate Dave Matthews, its 
just his fans. Its easy to disregard Ashlee Simpson fans 
when they insist on ...well, anything. Yet, when chief 
among Mekons fans are Greil Marcus and the late Lester 
Bangs, well, its time to listen.
In all fairness, I should warn you: the Mekons cheated 
in making this collection. Instead of some semblance of 
chronological or thematic ordering, the band frontloaded 
its most popular songs. The first album, titled Heaven, 
is full of the bands most beloved epics. Heaven starts 
with Hard to Be Human, a rocking hybrid that would 
eventually come to be named alt-country and is one 
of the most remarkable cuts off the spectacular Fear and 
Whiskey.
The band continues with more hits such as Where Were 
You, a punk classic from the late 70s that remains one 
of their more powerful songs; Millionaire, a sarcastic, 
anthemic single that would grow into one of their more 
popular live songs; Memphis, Egypt, perhaps their 
purest rock song; and The Olde Trip to Jerusalem, 
which may best be described as a hybrid of gospel 
and punk that demonstrates the Mekons continuing 
inventiveness. Theres a somewhat even mix of older 
songs, too, with Where Were You dating back to 1978, 
and songs off their two most recent albums, released in 
2002 and 2004.
The second disc, Hell, contains lesser-known songs, many 
of them with darker themes. Yet its hard to consider 
this a collection of B-sides when songs like Big Zombie 
from Edge of the World are placed on this disc. For casual 
Mekons fans, this album shows off some of their more 
experimental and bizarre tracks.
But Im not convinced that there is such a thing as a 
casual Mekons fan. As far as I can tell, there are three 
different ways in which people relate to the band. 
There are the converted: people who own albums and 
download live performances and get into arguments over 
lyric metaphors. There are posers: people who were once 
told that the Mekons had something to do with starting 
alt-country, that Lester Bangs loved them, that they are
critically acclaimed. Perhaps they own Fear and Whiskey, 
but most likely they just name-drop the band whenever 
someone brings up alt-rock. There's a shocking number 
of people who know the Mekons place in the music 
pantheon and dont let the fact that they ve never listened 
to an album stop them from telling others. Finally, theres 
everyone else  who probably recognized none of the 
aforementioned songs or albums. Quite simply, most 
people havent heard of the Mekons. Which, frankly, is a 
terrible shame.
Heres the good news. Im going to spare you an exposition 
of the bands incredible history, what others have to say 
about it, the relevance of Dan Dare... Forget it. Thats what 
the Internet is for. Just go get this two-disc collection and 
spread the love. The album is perfect for nearly anyone, 
whether theyve never heard of the band, or if they went 
to see them at Club Caf last year (and then traveled 
to Cambridge to see them there as well  I admit it!). 
Theres only so much you can do to expose someone to a 
band he and his friends know nothing about. So let the 
band do the talking.
This album is a no-brainer. The first half will expose 
anyone to the bands varied background, with songs 
ranging all over the spectrum, and the second half will 
show exactly why all those big-shot critics cant keep it
in their pants when talking about the Mekons. Even for 
diehard fans, there will be something new here. With 
over 20 albums, its pretty hard to find someone who 
owns them all.
I was pleasantly surprised by some of the songs Id never 
heard before, which is an experience that all Mekons fans 
go through whenever they get a new album. Besides, any 
CD that has both Millionaire and Hard to Be Human 
is easily going to get a lot of playtime.
This isnt to say that I didnt have some gripes about the 
whole thing. I was saddened that Wild and Blue was 
left off the first album, even if it is a cover (all songs on 
Heaven and Hell are originals). Also, it is entirely unclear 
to me how Only You and Your Ghost Will Know missed 
the cut for the Hell disc, yet Dancing in the Head 
(both from the Out of Our Heads album) was included. 
Furthermore, its not clear to me that buying this album 
instead of Fear and Whiskey and Edge of the World is the 
best way to get an in-depth exposure to the band. But 
who cares? Its an amazing album from an amazing band. 
Go get it.

Upscale but not out of reach
Le Pommier offers up fine French cuisine

The interior of Le Pommier features artwork and a well-stocked bar. The atmosphere has an intimate and classy feel.
using very fresh ingredients.
My companion and I started off with cocktails. I chose the 
French martini, a blend of champagne, pineapple juice, 
and vodka; he went for the French 45, a gin and sparkling 
wine combination. The alcohol  and specifically the 
wine list  at Le Pommier can get pretty pricey, with 
most of the bottles costing over $20. However, they do 
have a small selection of wines by the glass that the wait 
staff will enthusiastically recommend. Both of us started 
with salads, simple mixes of fresh field greens each 
topped with a thick slice of rich blue cheese. His salad 
also came topped with a Bose pear slice. The freshness 
of the ingredients was very apparent from their taste. 
Even the bread at Le Pommier comes from a local bakery, 
and the menu points out the restaurants commitment 
to local organic food by listing the specific farms from 
which the meats hail.
I decided on the striped sea bass. The fish came on a 
bed of sauteed leeks and sundried tomatoes with green
Continued on page 7
While Le Pommier is an upscale restaurant, the 
atmosphere is casual and comforting. The restaurant is 
set up less in the style of a formal dining room and more 
in that of a country inn or family restaurant. There are 
two floors, with most of the diners eating in the first 
floor dining room, and the hardwood floors and fire in 
the fireplace go far in creating a cozy rather than a stuffy
atmosphere. Among the customers coming in were Pitt 
graduate students and South Side hipsters, as well as 
older couples who loved the restaurant enough to have a 
running tab there.
Upon being seated we were informed that Le Pommier 
offers a prix fixe menu including soup or pt, salad, 
choice of two entrees, and choice of two desserts for the 
remarkable price of $33 per person. Being a picky eater, 
I opted for ordering a la carte off the seasonal January 
through February menu.
I had long heard Le Pommier hailed as a shining example 
of how wonderful fine dining in Pittsburgh could be. 
When I went there recently for an anniversary, I was 
thrilled that the occasion warranted a trip to Le Pommier. 
I began thinking of this particular review in trepidation, 
as it originally seemed unlikely that CMU students would 
ever decide to dine at Le Pommier. Its upscale, highpriced reputation and its slightly inconvenient location 
in the South Side make it an unlikely stop. However, 
upon visiting Le Pommier, I was pleasantly surprised.

An outside view of the decadent Le Pommier, a provider of 
delicious French cuisine.
The menu at Le Pommier is French and very conservative. 
There is no hip fusion cuisine to be had, nor are there 
any of the obsequious dishes that cater to the lowfat, low-carb crowd. The menu features simple, classic 
French food, and while it lacks any vegetarian main 
course options, a polite note at the bottom claims that 
the chef will be happy to accommodate any special 
dietary needs. True, it is one of the few restaurants in 
Pittsburgh to feature escargot as well as seasonal housemade pt on the menu, but most of the dishes are fairly 
uncomplicated; they are simply excellently prepared

_opinion._______________
Radio Free Pittsburgh: how to revive the airways
DJs should mix up the lineup with deep tracks and older favorites
Inasmuch as I have not yet launched my own radio station
 or even a music blog, for that matterIm pretty much 
resigned to listening to other peoples stations during the 
day. Okay, Clear Channels stations. I dont have anything 
against Clear Channel per se  Ill leave that to R.E.M.
 but the narrow playlists on the citys major rock radio 
players (DVE, The X, K-Rock, RRK) leave me wanting a 
bit more. With such vast collections of music to choose 
from, I think that it is possible for major radio stations 
to play a more diverse range of songs and still maintain 
strong listening bases.
Before getting too deeply into the lack of diversity across 
the radio dial, let me point out the impressive array 
of sounds being broadcast from the basement of the 
University Center by our friends at 88.3 WRCT. (Note 
to WRCT management: Ill be expecting that check 
shortly.) Of course, the DJs at WRCT have significantly 
more freedom than their professional counterparts and 
no worries about having to pay the bills, but there must 
be a middle ground somewhere. Thats why I think rock 
stations should play around with their rotations a bit, 
and I am pleased by some recent efforts to do so.
There are some examples of major Pittsburgh rock 
stations that have mixed things up, generally to good 
effect. The X (105.9 FM) has recently introduced a 
couple of splendid new programs called Nine from the 
90s and The Nooner. The former is, as advertised, 
nine straight tracks from the past decade. Putting aside 
the fact that I prefer songs from the 90s to those from 
our current decade, this program is wonderful mostly 
because although you really used to like the songs, but 
havent heard them in ages. When was the last time 
you actually heard Porno for Pyros Tahitian Moon 
or Better Than Ezras Good, as I did during the show 
today? I felt like I was 14 again. Nine from the 90s is

beans and small fried potato slices. It had been cooked 
simply in a light champagne sauce, allowing the leeks 
and tomatoes to serve as its primary flavoring. My 
companions choice, the halibut and shrimp cooked in 
parchment, was very similarly prepared. There were no 
heavy flavors or inventive combinations; the food was 
excellent in its simplicity and reliance on classic French 
Sauces.
The dessert menu at Le Pommier follows the same 
model of providing traditional, well-made desserts with 
top-quality ingredients. The dessert menu has such a 
reputation that we saw a few couples enter the restaurant, 
desiring only dessert, just as we were finishing up. While 
the cheese platter and the crme brle seemed tempting,
an easy way for The X to provide musical variety and 
keep things fresh without straying too much from their 
core sensibilities. Likewise with The Nooner, an almost 
entirely unstructured block of programming each day 
at lunchtime that centers on a theme almost arbitrarily 
chosen by the DJ. Now this is a solid bit of programming: 
Its not always pretty, but it keeps listeners on their toes 
and lets them hear things they ordinarily wouldnt.
Of course, it is possible to go wrong with themed 
programming. The Bootleg Weekend on The X is a 
poorly conceived notion wherein the DJ plays the same 
songs he would normally, only with much lower fidelity. 
Whom this appeals to is beyond my comprehension
 if anything, bootlegs are for diehard fans and are 
essentially the polar opposite of the reason a typical 
radio listener is in the game. Another bad theme on radio 
stations are when stations throw in doubles, blocks, 
twofers, or whatever catchy name they come up with 
for multiple consecutive tracks by the same artist. I 
dont care for this approach for two reasons. One, this 
approach doesnt really affect the stations playlist in 
any way. Its not like the classic rock station was going 
to avoid squeezing two Led Zeppelin hits into their day 
anyway  its just a slight change in the order. Two, the 
station will inevitably spin a group of songs by a band 
that you despise. When Dave Matthews comes on, I can 
usually take solace in the fact that hell go away in a few 
minutes  take that assurance away from me, and Im in 
trouble. And even when a group you dig gets two of their 
tracks on, you can usually guess at least one of them; if 
you really wanted to hear two of their songs, well, thats 
what the CD player is for.
However, there is hope for radio stations to improve 
the quality of their programs. Playing more songs that 
werent marketed as singles  so-called deep tracks
we decided upon the daily sorbet of mixed berries and 
the dessert crpes. Our expectations for the high quality 
of the desserts were confirmed when they arrived. The 
berry sorbet, served with fresh berries on a vanilla crisp, 
was so rich that its texture was identical to that of ice 
cream. The crpes, served warm and full of rich cream, 
were flavored lightly with chestnut and pear and came 
with a small amount of chilled cream. Both were standard 
French desserts that Le Pommier made outstanding.
Le Pommier is a little on the expensive side, but 
considering the quality of food and atmosphere, it is 
well worth the dining experience. The prix fixe menu is 
an exceptional value and a good way for students to try 
out their many offerings. While I saw few groups larger 
than two at Le Pommier, this restaurant is definitely
 would make the programs more enjoyable. Im not 
certain why programmers seem to regard this as such 
a gamble. Sure, people like to hear the hits, and youve 
gotta score with the Nielsen ratings. Still, is it so much of 
a stretch to play something a little less known by a wellregarded band? Surely if a group can get three tracks 
from one record on the radio, there must be a fourth 
somewhere on the album that isnt total rubbish. I dont 
think Stone Temple Pilots ever tried to write a song they 
couldnt imagine being on the radio. Witness the success 
of single-artist programs like Metallica Meltdown or 
Get the Led Out. Naturally, not every artist has a catalog 
as well respected as those two titans do, but it seems to 
me that listeners of The X might occasionally like to hear 
a few tracks from Radiohead or Janes Addiction other 
than Creep or Been Caught Stealing.
This is why radio stations should really give their DJs 
more freedom in selecting the music that they play. Have 
a Track #8 Weekend. See how far the DJ can go only 
playing songs named One. Make an hour of 7/4 time 
signatures. Play songs and their notable cover versions 
back-to-back. There are all sorts of things that can be 
done to diversify the playlist and keep the audience 
thinking. The people managing the major broadcasters 
and directing the playlists must be at least somewhat 
knowledgeable about music to have ascended to their 
posts  let them use their intuition a little bit. Perhaps 
this is a bit idealistic, but I think that changing things 
from the normal three-songs-and-a-commercial routine 
is an improvement for listeners and programmers alike.

recommended for couples and small gatherings. The food 
is neither hip nor experimental, nor is the atmosphere 
too stuffy or formal. In fact, if you speak to the wait 
staff in French, they will probably respond in English. 
Le Pommier is instead upscale French cooking done 
Pittsburgh style, with class and quality as well as simplicity 
and friendliness. I had an excellent time celebrating 
my special occasion there, and with Valentines Day 
coming up soon, CMU students should consider giving 
Le Pommier a try. Its traditionally good, uncomplicated 
food will satisfy even the pickiest date.

Located close to downtown, many office 
workers drop by Eides on their lunch breaks.

Although the store sells as much music and movies as it does comics these 
days, it has an enduring popularity as a comics shop. It was voted Best 
Comic Book Shop of Pittsburgh in a Pittsburgh City Paper readers poll.
Although there are other contenders for the title of Oldest Comic Shop in 
Pittsburgh," Eides Entertainment is the only one that has been owned and 
operated continuously since its beginning. Started in 1972 on the North Side as 
Pittsburghs First Comix and Sci-Fi Shop by Greg Eide, the store was founded 
at the very beginning of the comics shop revolution. Today the store is three huge 
floors of movies, records, CDs, and, of course, the largest collection of back issue 
comics in Pittsburgh.

shops got a steep discount from publishers. This was 
also beneficial for comic fans, since they could now 
complete their collections by taking advantage of the 
stored back-issues.
Soon there were comics shops in every city doing good 
business. Throughout the 1980s business improved, 
but many sales were to collectors speculating on the 
value of rare comics. When these people lost confidence 
in the early 1990s, over half of all comic shops were 
driven out of business.
Slowly the industry has recovered. Today, there are 
numerous and easily available alternative comics that 
were rare in the 1980s, and more and more comics 
are appealing to intelligent, adult readers. Luckily, in 
Pittsburgh the comics community never bought too 
deeply into the speculation boom and many of the 
stores survived to thrive today.

^ Pittsburgh and comic books have a long history 
together. Jim Shooter, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics 
from 1978 to 1987, got his start in Pittsburgh, selling 
stories to DC Comics at age 13. Throughout the 1970s 
and into today, Pittsburgh has had a dedicated comics 
fandom with large, vibrant conventions. Best of all, 
the city has some of the greatest comic book shops of 
any city with a great variety for all types of readers.
Comic bookshops are a surprisingly recent phenomenon, 
first appearing in the early 1970s. Traditionally, 
comic books had been sold alongside newspapers and 
magazines through newsstands and drug stores. When 
these stores had leftover comics, they'd return them 
to the publisher along with the other periodicals to be 
destroyed. The genius of the dedicated comic shop 
was based on a new relationship with publishers and 
retailers known as the direct market. By promising

The Copacetic Comics Company is a strange and delightful place.
Totally anomalous  not exactly a comic book store. We sell stuff that 
you wont find anywhere else, between Chicago and New York.
Bill Boichell started dealing comics in the 1970s, later 
running a convention in Monroeville. In 1986 he started 
his first store, B.E.M. (Bug-Eyed Monster), which was 
ten times the size of Copacetic.
The ideological basis of the store is a leveling. 
Comics are on the same level as everything else.H
v
You ka?Jw you want something good, and 
everything in the store is good. Its pre-screened.
.jvssrm.
This includes self-published mini-comics, new books, unusual back issues, jazz CDs, 
DVDs, art books, and a few used books. A tiny store for readers with eclectic taste, many 
of his customers have been shopping with him for years, Owner Bill Boichell marks down 
some special items  those he really want people to read. Bill is on a mission to challenge 
his customers to try something new, encouraging jazz fans to try reading comics and comic
^collectors to pick up a novel.
B.E.M. closed in 1995, and Bill sold most of his stock, almost 30,000 
comics, to Phantom of the Attic. When Bill decided to open a new store a 
few years later, he found a small storefront a short walking distance from 
Squirrel Hill, with a bench out front for good weather. Customers can even 
leave bikes unlocked out front because it is located directly across from the 
Squirrel Hill Police Station.
Although recommendations are almost unnecessary here, there are a few that should be 
mentioned. Love and Rockets, a comic from the 1980s by the Hernandez brothers, is a store 
favorite. Kramers-Ergot #5 is a cutting-edge art anthology of experimental comics and Kevin 
Huizengas re-issue of Super Monster Comics #14, the absolute number one best-selling 
comic Copacetic has ever had, is also worth picking up.
Phantom of the Attic, owned by Jeff Yandora, 
is the most convenient store for people at 
CMU and Pitt and a wonderfully comfortable 
place. Contradicting the stereotype portrayed 
on television of a comic shop as dark, dank, 
and unfriendly, Phantom is a warm store with 
clerks who remember their regular customers, 
recommend personal favorites and are more 
than willing to make a special order. Although 
superheroes are available, the selection 
doesnt stop there. The varied tastes of college 
students let the store offer a wide variety of 
alternative comics, trade paperbacks, and 
graphic novels at reasonable prices.
All three of these great comic shops are worth the trip to try something new or 
rediscover an old hobby. Comic book enthusiasts and novices alike should take 
advantage of the variety of comic books available in these Pittsburgh stores.

---------------------------------------------------

Q] HOeOSiOPES.
..........................................-.......................................................................
BY DINAH WINNICK
ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Its wonderful to have such a big heart and the 
inability to say no to the half-frozen stray kittens who take up residence on your 
porch in these cold winter months. Dont worry. You'll be a great mother to all 
37 of them.
TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Chemical engineering and drama are equally 
taxing, just in different ways. In the end you will realize that its not really 
something worth breaking up over, though the lack of shared interests and 
incompatible personalities may be what actually does the trick.
GEMINI (May 21 - June 21): Tuesday morning you will finally get your calling. 
Unfortunately you'll be in the shower and the talent scout wont bother leaving 
a message.
CANCER (June 22 - July 22): Somewhere in Pittsburgh your true love is waiting. 
Whether for a bus, for a paycheck, for a quick fling, or for a lifelong relationship 
is unclear at this time.
LEO (July 23 - August 22): Youll try to spread the word that biking is the new 
driving. If and when your locked bike tragically gets driven over by a bus, just 
remember: walking is the new biking.
VIRGO (August 23 - September 22): Learning seven languages in an attempt to 
be able to communicate with almost anyone in the world is a great idea. Sure, 
your yet-to-be-discovered soul mate lives on a remote island with a language 
spoken only by the 34 people in her village, but just think of how great you are 
at picking these things up by now.
LIBRA (September 23 - October 23): The mac and cheese will be a bit too little 
mac and a bit too much cheese, but the bottle of water you get with it will be 
just right.
SCORPIO (October 24 - November 21): At this exciting but tumultuous time in 
your life, just read the signs around you and youll know where you're going. A 
bus schedule would be helpful as well.
SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21): Youll have to wait 20 minutes 
in the cold for the next bus home, but you'll catch one right away coming to 
campus in the morning as long as you stay away from caffeine, domestic rodents, 
and country-western films in the meantime. The world is in a fine balance.
CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19): Tomorrow you will choose to wear 
your plain old cheapo synthetic scarf instead of your fancy new angora one, 
preserving for at least one more day the possibility of a relationship with your 
endearingly-allergic-to-everything lab partner.
AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18): Unfortunately, your love of football will 
not be reciprocated. On the upside, you will get to keep the ball as a souvenir 
after it smashes into your face.
PISCES (February 19 - March 20): Sure, learning how to cook would solve your 
predicament of being constantly hungry but unable to care properly for yourself. 
Of course, so would dropping out of school to create your own startup company 
and living on takeout and TV dinners for 65 years, until you come up with a 
genius idea and can finally afford a personal chef (or expensive retirement home 
staff). Either way, you can make it happen. Where there's a will...

_comics.
Comickaze
Goodies from Santa Claus
From time to time, even a serious columnist like myself needs 
to step out of his job of pandering shamelessly to cartoonists 
and broach a. serious and controversial topic, the likes of 
which may rock the very foundations of comics as an art, an 
experience, and even a philosophy.
Thankfully, this is not the case today. Let the windbaggery 
continue!
The Christmas haul this year:
THE COMPLETE BONE, by Jeff Smith
These 1300 pages of fun and adventure are like a ray of 
sunshine on the melancholy pall that followed the official last 
issue of Bone a few months ago. If youre not already familiar 
with the series, then now is an excellent time to head out to 
your closest local bookstore and purchase yourself a copy. 
Creator, author, and writer Jeff Smith, a native of Columbus, 
Ohio, has woven an enormous epic out of a series of short, 
readable stories with drawings that are cartoonish in style, yet 
underpinned with emotional complexity. It has the feeling of 
a Miyazaki movie.
My favorite elements of Bone's story are the unforgettable 
characters, whose personalities are simultaneously 
transparent and deep. Its a far-flung stretch from the bland, 
cookie-cutter character archetypes that permeate modern 
manga, and has a more expressive, personal style to boot. By 
comparison, Tokyopop is like stupid, stupid rat creatures!
THE COMPLETE LOCAS, by Jaime Hernandez
Tina Robbins says that No other man in or out of the field 
understands women the way [Jaime] does. Demigod Alan 
Moore describes Jaimes comics as a wedding of classicism 
and cool, and Rolling Stone hails Locas as American fictions 
best-kept secret. I wrote a whole article about how awesome 
this comic is, and now its been compiled into one volume! 
Why dont you already own this? Its more than just comics, its 
a whole world in itself  and yet still unmistakably personal.
THE COMPLETE PEANUTS vol. 1 & 2, by Charles Schulz
Dont assume you know anything about Peanuts until youve 
read it from the beginning. Charles Schulz is the only 
cartoonist whose message is unmistakably frank, funny, and 
sad all at once. Hes also the only cartoonist Ive known whom 
absolutely everyone likes. Hes been drawing practically for 
comics entire modern history, and is universally recognized 
as a master of the craft. Furthermore, you may be surprised to 
learn, the comic strip is actually rife with plenty of really funny 
adult humor.
APPARAT, by Warren Ellis
A year ago Ellis conceived of a series of imaginary first issues 
of comics produced by an imaginary company that envisions 
what comics would be like today if the whole field had never 
become inundated with superheroes. The four books are on 
sale now. Angel Stomp Future describes an even more bizarre 
and perverse vision of the future than Ellis has ever offered 
before. Frank Ironwine is a detective who relies on the art of 
crime-solving rather than the science. Quit City revitalizes 
the dead pulp genre of pilot-drama, and is even successful! 
Finally, Simon Spector is Ellis response to the old school 
science heroes like Tom Strange and Doc Savage. The whole 
series nods to the tradition of pulp from the 30s that was 
totally squashed by the superhero genre and demonstrates 
that old ideas continue their relevance today by succeeding in 
the homage so many other comics attempt.
There are still more comics I need to get, and they make great 
late stocking stuffers, too.
LIGHTNING ROUND:
THE FILTH. Grant Morrison returns to his familiar stomping 
grounds: drugs, surrealism, deviant sex, and government 
conspiracy. HUTCH OWEN: UNMARKETABLE. Tom Hart 
explores our cultures awkward reaction to being unable to 
economically exploit 9/11. Pissing you off? Read the book, 
and maybe itll change your whole perspective. CLYDE FANS. 
A book about the detachment, failure, and tedium of life. 
Healthy medicine by master cartoonist Seth. Looking for 
explosions instead? Go buy a copy of JLA, you schmuck! Or 
better yet get BIGHEAD! A superhero extravaganza coupled 
with wry, deadpan humor. THE RAY. A little Asian girl gets 
X-ray vision and starts scamming people. A guilty pleasure. 
SCOTT PILGRIM. The only successful American manga, 
in my opinion, by Internet cartoonist Bryan Mai OMalley. 
It explores, rather than repeats, the whole genre and our 
reaction to it. IN THE SHADOW OF NO TOWERS. Another 
magnum opus by MAUS creator Art Spiegelman.
So go read these, then give them to me! Because you love me 
for my wit and beauty. Until next week, away!
In other news, congratulations to Victor Tak Bau Hsu for 
winning ABs superhero trivia contest last Friday. For the 
curious, here are the correct answers:
 Who killed Superman in issue #75? Doomsday
 Who was Spidermans first girlfriend? Gwen Stacy
 How many different people have been Batmans sidekick 
Robin? 3
 Who was not an original X-Man? Wolverine

the spirit of a Miyazaki movie.

Infernal Affairs
5VavhaAviT JnRBnRz!
A guy that looks a lot like Jet Li  Tony Leung Chiu  is in this movie as a 
cop. Hes been working undercover so long that they let him rise in the ranks. 
I think that means the work hes been doing has raised his prestige among 
his super-shady colleagues, but he hasnt actually gotten anywhere as a cop. 
In a cruel twist of irony, there is a member of the underground triads that is 
infiltrating the police force. I think there are a lot of tricky mind-boggling 
parts of this movie where the characters feel too close to their fake lives and 
too close to their real ones.
Lost Highway
$M8twAviT 6}/BnRBnRz}/BO
In accordance with the theme of the week, trading lives, this movie has Bill 
Pullman as Fred Madison who lives another life after shadily leaving prison. 
A saxophonist. No offense to the saxophonists out there, but the fact that he 
murders his wife and disappears from prison and leads another life once he 
escapes is not nearly as amusing as his saxophone skills. I mean, I want to 
know how a saxophonist has the skill to work in a garage and switch roles 
with another man to escape, disappear, or be released from prison. Does 
he, like the Pied Piper or Jiggly Puff, play his sax until the prison guards fall 
asleep or go comatose? I guess you can find out Thursday.
Wild Wild West
54wCviT J}/BnRB}/BnRz}/B!
This movie does only one thing for me: remind me that Will Smith should 
neither act nor sing. Okay, yeah, he was in Ali and Ive heard it was great. 
But Wild Wild West takes place before Will Smith was even trying to be in 
good(ish) movies. I know that someone becomes a half-spider towards the 
end. I also know that Kevin Kline should have stuck to serious films, like Life 
as a House. The theme song is sung by Will Smith, too, and yeah, its pretty 
terrible. But the ultimate oddity occurs when Kline and Smith battle against 
the half-spider Confederate. Freaky.
Garden State
5FiltwviT JnRBnRz!
Where has Zach Braff been all my life? This is his first directed film, which 
he also wrote, and it proves pretty' awesome. Natalie Portman plays the 
semi-annoying and generally quite perky love interest to the serious, almost 
emotionless Braff. The film begins with the death of Braff s mother and pro
gresses from there as he reunites with friends from high school and meets up 
with Portman. The film has a kick-ass soundtrack that trend-setters are long
ing to buy. Sometimes I got confused because of all his random hash-smoking 
friends. Sometimes there were too many stupid masturbating, humping, 
idiotic pet jokes. However, those are sidenotes to an otherwise terrific 
movie.
True Stories
5FthviT JnRBnRz!
David Byrne of Talking Heads is in this movie. Apparendy hes all over this 
movie. He wrote it, he headlined it, he directed it. And of course, he had a 
large hand in the soundtrack. The plot is a bit untraditional: Byrne wanders 
around a fictional Texas town during its sesquicentennial. (That means its 
150 years old. I had no idea. I dont know what most words mean, anyhow.) 
Im guessing the gist of the story is that they make a lot of fun at Texans in 
cliches and whatnot. I think Im okay with that, though. Some fan said it was 
examining small town weirdness, too. Poor large towns; they always get 
passed over for their weirdness.
