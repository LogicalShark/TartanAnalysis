Despite getting kicked off 
campus over the past two years, 
Kappa Sigma and Delta Upsilon 
(DU) fraternities are returning to 
the quad next year with a pleas
ant surprise: millions of dollars of 
renovations to their houses.
Jennifer Church, interim dean 
of Student Affairs, decided to al
low the two fraternities back on
the fraternity quad last Monday. 
Kappa Sigma and Delta Upsilon 
have fulfilled the requirements for 
return set out by Student Affairs 
and the University Committee on 
Discipline, respectively.
The return will eliminate Forbes 
House and the newly renovated 
Global Studies house as first-year 
housing options.
Changes on the quad
When DU left, Global Studies 
House occupied the building after 
it received $1.1 million in renova
tions. Made up of 30 first-year stu
dents from eight countries, Global 
Studies House brings together 
people from different cultures to 
form a close-knit community. The 
house also has plans for a booth at 
this years Spring Carnival.
Its the best dorm on campus, 
said Gicheru Mwariri, a first year 
biology student and Global Stud
ies resident.
But some students at Global 
Studies House do not think DU 
deserves to get their hous back.
They destroyed it, Mwariri 
said.
The DU brothers see things a lit
tle differently. Weve been in that 
house since they built it, said An
drew Melichar, DU president and 
a junior in music composition. 
Its traditionally been our house, 
and I think we deserve it. 
According to Steve Williams, 
vice president of DU, each 
brother has performed 50 hours 
of community service, completed 
AlcoholEDU training, attended

are becoming more valuable 
commodities as competition for 
admittance to Carnegie Mellon 
grows steadily.
On February 17, the Univer
sity announced that applications 
are up 20 percent from last 
school year, with nearly 19,000 
applicants competing for 1360 
spots in next years incoming 
class.
According to a February 1 re
port by the Office of Admission, 
every school in Carnegie Mellon 
saw an increase in applicants 
this year. The Tepper School of 
Business experienced the larg

With tuition officially rising 
next fall and federal financial 
aid programs facing cutbacks, 
Carnegie Mellon students may 
feel an increased tug on their 
wallets from the higher learning 
community.
According to a Carnegie Mel

Board of Trustees authorized 
a tiered tuition increase on 
February 17. Returning students 
will pay 4.4 percent more 
for tuition next fall  a total of 
$33,050. Incoming first-years 
will pay a tuition eight percent 
higher than the current, or a to

Dr. Ruth Westheimer addressed an audience in McConomy Auditorium yesterday morning as part of the 2006 MOSAIC conference on gender issues. Westheimer shared her life experiences.
Annual MOSAIC conference celebrates Milestones
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
The more we talk, the less we 
will have problems, said famed 
sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer 
in the keynote address that kicked 
off the 2006 MOSAIC conference 
yesterday. Though referring to 
sexual problems, her advice can 
be applied to all the topics that 
Carnegie Mellons annual gender 
issues conference brought to the 
forefront.
This years event was designed 
to to appeal to a more diverse au
dience by offering programs with 
a gender-related spin on a wider 
variety of topics  from female 
activism to social security, diet
ing, dating, drama, health care, 
and the Great Depression.
[The conferences goal was] 
to get people thinking about 
gender as it applies to our lives, 
said Becca Steinberg, a senior 
technical writing major and gen
der issues intern. The conference 
changed its focus last year from
womens issues to gender issues 
to reach more groups on campus.
People dont just want the 
same old second-wave femi
nist rhetoric, Steinberg said. 
We want to focus on issues that 
havent been addressed before 
that affect a larger proportion of 
the campus community.
This years theme was Mile
stones to commemorate the 10th 
anniversary of MOSAIC and the 
100th anniversary of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College. 
Westheimer began the pro
gram by sharing the milestones in 
her own life. Born into an Ortho
dox Jewish family in Germany, 
she was sent to a school in Swit
zerland as a child to escape the 
Holocaust.
After she lived on a kibbutz in 
Palestine, taught kindergarten in 
Jerusalem, trained to be a sniper 
in what is now the Israeli Defense 
Force, and earned a degree in 
psychology in Paris, she came to 
the United States on a scholar
ship for European immigrants 
from the New School for Social
Research in New York. Upon earn
ing a masters degree in sociology, 
Westheimer worked in public 
health at Columbia University.
But it was a job at a New 
York Planned Parenthood that 
launched her interest in sex.
[I thought] there is something 
drastically wrong with these peo
ple. All they talk about is sex, she 
recalled. They dont talk about 
literature, or research  not even 
the weather. After 48 hours I

hands. Being a second semester 
senior is awesome, she said. I 
have nothing to do.
The concept of nothing to 
do is relative, of course. While 
DiGiovanni has finished her law 
school applications and has con
cluded her term as president of Al
pha Chi Omegas (previously Zeta 
Psi Sigma), she continues to hold 
the position of Greek Sing chair, 
take a full load of classes, serve 
in the Greek Task Force, work as 
a peer tutor with Academic De
velopment, and intern with the 
Women and Girls Foundation of 
Southwest Pennsylvania.
Though enjoying this break 
from stress, she also admits that 
handing over many of her previous
responsibilities has not been easy.
This semester has been hard 
for me personally because Im 
not in the drivers seat anymore, 
DiGiovanni said. In Alpha Chi 
Omega this transition has been 
particularly challenging. Since 
Im not president, Im not in the 
loop anymore.
Last semester Zeta Psi Sigma 
entered the process of transform
ing itself from a local sorority to a 
national organization, and in the 
past month decided on Alpha Chi 
Omega. As the president of her so
rority and Panhellenic president 
the previous year, DiGiovanni 
was one of the ringleaders in the 
decision to become national. She

Art curation and modern migration in this weeks lectures
by Brittany McCandless
News Editor
Two speakers are coming to 
campus this week to discuss a 
unique art curation experience 
and the literature of modern 
migration.
Today, Tom Smart, the direc
tor of museum programs at the 
Frick Art and Historical Center, 
will discuss the unique circum
stances of his work as part of 
the Aesthetics Out of Bounds 
Lecture Series.
Director of collections and 
exhibitions, Smart creates new 
methods of understanding his
torical collections by meshing 
them with modern art. He has 
worked with contemporary 
artists to rethink the Frick col
lection through contemporary
performance, installation, and 
object placement.
Smart has recently been 
appointed director of the McMichael Canadian Collection, 
one of Canadas collections of 
work by the early 20th-century 
painters known as The Group 
of Seven and by Canadian Inuit 
artists. In his new position, he 
is responsible for developing 
the collections and programs, 
including those involving con
temporary artists, broadening 
its audience, and directing the 
operation.
The Center for the Arts in 
Society sponsors the Aesthet
ics Out of Bounds lecture series 
with a grant from the Andrew 
Mellon Foundation.
What is the new migration 
of the past 50 years? Susan 
Standford Friedman will answer
this in her lecture The New Mi
gration and Literature: Gender, 
Nation, and Narration in the 
Global Age on Thursday.
Professor of English and wom
ens studies at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison, Fried
man will discuss migration and 
question whether it has intro
duced a clash of civilizations 
between West and East and 
betweeen North and South.
As her abstract inquires, 
Are the new migrants to 
Europe and North America 
differently resistant to as
similation, in contrast to older 
waves of immigrants?
The founder and former 
coordinator of the Cultural 
Studies in Global Context Clus
ter at UW-Madison, Friedman 
will tie her lecture topic to cur
rent events.
[The topic] is especially 
pertinent to the times because 
of the significance of migration 
for the recent, struggles over 
the Danish cartoon and also 
the riots in France last fall, 
Friedman stated in an e-mail, 
noting that she will begin her 
lecture by discussing the two 
incidents.
According to her abstract, 
Friedman will also explore the 
literature of the new migration 
to challenge the apocalyptic 
narratives of civilizational clash 
in this period of intensified 
transnational migration.
She has published numerous 
books, articles, and book chap
ters, and her work has been 
translated into six languages.

and cultural studies in global

Over the weekend, 127 student 
organizations submitted budget re
quests totaling $1.3 million. With only 
around $950,000 to distribute, the 
Joint Funding Committee (JFC) will 
soon begin the work of trimming about 
26 percent from the organizations 
requests.
What JFC does is clear: It decides 
who gets what. How they decide, on the 
other hand, is not so clear.
The best way to learn about JFCs 
decision-making is to consider the in
formation its members dont take into 
account as they allocate the funds.
Most surprisingly, JFC does not take 
into account how much money goes 
toward different types of activities. But 
as caretakers of the students money, 
JFC members should look at the big 
picture. They should take into account 
how they are investing students re
sources. To lend a hand, Ive calcu
lated the breakdown for the 2005-2006 
allocations:
 Carnival expenses, such as Booth, 
Buggy, and the concert, drew 25.6 
percent, a whopping $244,816.32, of 
the years funds.
 Events like ABs non-carnival con
certs and films used 23.7 percent.
 Media organizations, like The 
Tartan, WRCT, and cmuTV were 
granted 15.2 percent.
 Athletic groups, like club sports 
and martial arts, received 13.2 percent.
 Scholarly groups such as the 
Undergraduate Investment Club, AB 
Lectures and Political Speakers, and the 
Astronomy Club, received 8.2 percent.
 Arts organizations, like The 
Frame, Scotch n Soda, and the a 
cappella groups found themselves with 
a mere five percent.
 Cultural groups got 3.1 percent.
 Other Affinity groups like 
cmuOUT and the Womens Center made 
due with 2.8 percent.
 Student government claimed a 
very modest 1.3 percent.
 Community service groups took 
0.6 percent.
 Gaming clubs took 0.4 percent.
 Advocacy groups, like Amnesty 
International and EARTH, were at the 
bottom of the heap with 0.3 percent.
(The remaining 0.6 percent went to 
the Activities Fairs.)
Carnival, concerts, and movies get 
almost half of all of students money, 
while our community service, support, 
and advocacy groups make do with 
mere 3.7 percent. Is that really reflec
tive of what the student body wants?
Nobody knows. JFCs only indica
tion of what the students want is how 
much individual organizations  many 
of which are controlled by just a few 
students  request each year. I think it 
would be a good investment for student 
government to take another couple 
hundred dollars for itself and work with 
the statistics department to learn about 
what students really value.
Even more disheartening than the 
overall breakdown is that different 
types of groups end up with very dif
ferent portions of their budgets getting 
cut. JFC cut the budgets of Carnival 
and Events categories by 11 percent 
and eight percent respectively. On aver
age, the JFC cut the requested budgets 
of scholarly organizations, commu
nity service groups, advocacy groups, 
and support groups by 38 percent, 36 
percent, 32 percent, and 30 percent, 
respectively. Media lucked out with 
19-percent budget cuts, on average. 
Smaller organizations, those that ask 
for less than $14,000, have significantly 
larger portions of their budgets cut. The 
effect is that its tough for new organi
zations to grow, while large organiza
tions are given the wave-through. In 
effect, status quo is given priority over 
innovation.
Last years JFC members had noth
ing but the best intentions  but they 
missed the big picture. This years JFC 
has the ability to bring harmony back 
into the allocation process. I hope that 
as they conduct their arduous and 
thankless work, they make allocations 
consistent with our communitys values 
and priorities by keeping sight of the 
big picture.

Researchers question college prep tests
by Justine Lee
Staffwriter
Scoring a five on an AP exam 
may not be as useful as many 
high schoolers think.
A recent study conducted by 
Philip Sadler of Harvard Uni
versity and Robert Tai of the 
University of Virginia established 
an overall trend that good scores 
on AP exams do not necessarily 
translate to success in the college 
courses.
Furthermore, Sadler and Tai 
believe that students are strug
gling in these introductory 
courses because colleges are too 
lenient in what they will accept 
for credit.
Eric Grotzinger, the associ
ate dean of the Mellon College 
of Science, does not believe that 
Carnegie Mellon falls under this
category.
If anything, Grotzinger said, 
CMU is strict.
According to an article in The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, the 
study involved surveying 18,000 
college students about their sci
ence education.
Sadler and Tai specifically 
looked at students who took in
troductory courses in biology, 
physics, or chemistry, although 
they scored high enough on the 
respective AP exam to test out of 
the course.
The survey determined that 
half the students who received a 
five on the AP exam did not re
ceive As in the course.
Presumably, if the AP score 
was really equivalent to a col
lege grade, then [these students] 
should have been able to do well 
in the college courses exam 
without even taking the course,
Sadler said.
At Carnegie Mellon, to receive 
credit for introductory physics 
and chemistry, students must 
score a five on the AP exam. 
These students have the option of 
forfeiting their AP credit in order 
to take the honors-level courses 
in these subjects.
Students who score a five in 
AP Biology are able to bypass 
introductory biology (03-110). 
However, if the student wants to 
take an additional biology course 
that has 03-110 as a pre-requisite, the student must first pass 
an assessment of 40 questions, 
covering information on which 
Carnegie Mellon biology courses 
tend to focus.
We have these assessments in 
place to ensure that students are 
ready for the college courses at

MOSAIC explores gender issues
MOSAIC, from A1
thought, What an interesting topic.
During her keynote address, Westheimer 
imparted her views on abortion. From where I 
stand, abortion must remain legal, not as a contra
ceptive, but if there is a contraceptive failure, she 
said.
Though being largely known as a sexually 
progressive sexpert, Westheimer discussed 
abstinence. [Abstinence is] not just for the ortho
dox. Anyone who wants to remain abstinent until 
marriage should, she said.
Westheimer derived the bulk of her advice 
from her hardships as a child and successes as an 
adult.
When an opportunity is presented, take a risk, 
she said. Stand up and be counted.
Westheimer was confident that Carnegie Mellon 
students were up to the task. Carnegie Mellon is a 
big name. You are at a fantastic university. I would 
never expect you to follow anyone elses ideas, she 
said.
Following Westheimers keynote, she held a question-and-answer session with participants.
There is no question that what has changed is 
that women are being educated, she answered 
when asked about the change she has seen in gender 
issues.
In addition to scheduling Westheimer, the 27- 
member MOSAIC planning committee, chaired by 
junior social and decision sciences major Jamie Ed
wards, designed a series of panels and workshops to 
encourage participants to take an active interest in 
gender issues.
In Pittsburgh Pacesetters, three female Pittsbur
ghers shared their roles in contributing to the growth 
of the city, while another three women shared their 
professional experiences in Generation XX: Women 
in Male-Dominated Fields.
Other panels focused less on gender and more 
on bringing people of all genders, sexual orienta
tions, religions, and ethnicities together. Imagi
nary Home-lives discussed the comfort in keeping 
a religious or ethnic identity, especially to first- and 
second-generation immigrants.
New Milestones: Crafting the Nations First LGBT 
Public Health Certificate Program discussed the ad
vantages of developing such a program, while Who 
Wears the Pants? A Look at the Terms, Rules, and
Culture of Modern Dating took a lighter .tone with 
its discussion of traditional gender-specific roles or 
rules in the dating world.
Steinberg emphasized the importance of in
volving community members from as many 
demographics as possible  from the alumnae of 
Margaret Morrison College to the third- to fifthgrade girls who came with presenter Lindsay Hyde. 
Hyde was the facilitator of the I Wanna Be a Su
per (Role) Model: Women and Mentorship panel 
and is the founder and director of Strong Women, 
Strong Girls, a not-for-profit organization that men
tors girls and young women. The girls decorated 
T-shirts with the help of Delta Delta Delta sorority 
members.
Alumnae from Margaret Morrison College  
the all-women college that closed in 1973 when 
Carnegie Mellon became co-ed  served on the 
conferences planning committee and attested to 
the change in the role of women from their own 
college experiences.
We were not front and center in all disciplines, 
but [female students today] are totally integrated, 
said Toni Ungaretti, class of 1970. There are no 
bounds to their choices.
Eileen McConomy, class of 1956, agreed, noting 
the gender gap in her academic experience. In my 
graduating class, there was one woman engineer, 
she said.
Gretchen Lankford, class of 1943 and founder 
of Carnegie Mellons Academy of Lifelong Learn
ing, shared her experience as a woman in a 
predominantely male-populated field at Carnegie 
Tech.
I wanted to be an engineer, but I couldnt ma
triculate into the engineering department, so I got 
a degree in general studies, she said.
Current college students had a different take on 
the subject.
[MOSAIC is] important at our school because 
[Carnegie Mellon] is male-dominated, said Ryan 
Chin, a junior economics major.
Steinberg hopes that the female as well as 
the male populations will benefit from the 
conference.
Id like to see people thinking that gender issues 
affect everyone, no matter what your gender, and 
looking at the difference between Margaret Mor
rison and us and seeing how far weve come and 
where were going.

Students commemorate Cuban crash
by Michael M. Whiston

Cuban fighter planes shot 
down two civilian U.S. planes on 
humanitarian missions over in
ternational waters in 1996  10 
years later, junior policy and 
management major David O. Ca
ballero held a moment of silence 
for the victims.
Four humanitarian pilots  
Mario M. de la Pena, Carlos Costa, 
Pablo Morales, and Armando 
Alejandre  were flying a 
Brothers to the Rescue mission 
between Florida and Cuba on 
February 24, 1996. They were 
shot down between 3:21 and 
3:28 pm by order of the Cuban 
government.
Im trying to commemorate 
the lives of these four men, Ca
ballero said, leading Fridays 
memorial outside Hunt Library. 
A group of four formed a circle 
around Caballero as he outlined 
the tragedy and read biographies 
of the victims. The memorial 
ended with a seven-minute mo
ment of silence, during which 
Caballero made mention of the 
exact times when the planes were 
shot down.
Caballero intended to observe 
the humanitarian efforts of the 
victims and put politics aside.
They were young individuals, 
something we can all relate 
to, Caballero said. Three of the 
four pilots were under 30 years 
old.
The four pilots were on a Broth
ers to the Rescue mission when 
they went down, Caballero ex
plained. Brothers to the Rescue is 
a humanitarian organization that 
rescues Cuban refugee rafters es
caping from Cuba to the United 
States. According to an online 
source, the organization has res
cued over 4200 individuals since
its initiation.
Memorials for the victims were 
held across 30 to 40 universities 
as a part of the Races de Es
peranza, a student-run confer
ence bringing together CubanAmerican Student Associations 
across the nation. Caballero is 
currently writing the constitution
for Carnegie Mellons CubanAmerican Student Association, a 
group open to anyone interested 
in assisting the community and

Board of Trustees raises tuition
TUITION, from A1
is that Carnegie Mellon be
comes so high-priced that it 
becomes inaccessible for lowincome students.... Students on 
financial aid are held harmless as 
it were.
Along with the $2734 and 
$1454 tuition increases for 
incoming and returning stu
dents, financial aid will increase 
by the same amounts for all who 
qualify.
There was a time when we 
were a destination for lowincome students that were the 
first generation in the family 
to attend college, Cohon said.
Students borrowing money to 
meet the rising tuition, though, 
could face an increased strain in 
light of Senate, House, and White 
House budget proposals.
Loans are going to be mar
ginally more expensive, said 
William Elliott, vice-president 
for enrollment. The final budget 
will probably be some compro
mise between the House and 
Senate, he added, citing a lack 
of support for the Bush adminis
trations plans.
U.S. News and World Report 
reported on January 30 that the 
interest rate on Stafford Loans 
could increase from 5.3 percent 
to 6.8 percent. The rate for Par
ent Loans for Undergraduate 
Students could increase from a 
variable 6.1 percent to perma
nent 8.5 percent.
In addition, Pell grants, capped 
at $4050 since 2003, could be 
made available to more families
for larger sums.
There was a time when about 
80 percent of our financial aid 
for students came from the gov
ernment  it is now less than 20 
percent, Elliott said. Clinton 
put the government out of the fi
nancial aid business and into the 
loan business.
With tuition increasing and 
federal initiatives aligning to 
the changing needs of the 
legislature, Carnegie Mellon has 
stepped up its own fundraising 
efforts.
This fundraising campaign, 
which, as of December 25 had 
raised $258 million in three 
years, is focused on raising money 
for endowment, noted vice-presi
dent of University Advancement 
Robbee Baker Kosak.
The campaign is not going 
to be felt overnight, Kosak 
said, citing the $88 million 
Gates Center and new labs in 
Doherty Hall as the most topical 
changes resulting from recent 
fundraising efforts. We are 
now raisng $6 million a year in 
annual donations.
Despite this campaign and 
an increase in tuition, Carnegie 
Mellon continues to experience 
a tighter budget than its peers.
We are very, very careful 
about how we spend every dime, 
Kosak said.
Carnegie Mellons use of a tiered 
tuition increase differs from peer 
institutions also with plans for 
tuition increases this year.
Duke University announced in 
a February 24 press release that 
its tuition will increase at a flat 
rate of 4.5 percent to 32,845,
countered by a 5.7 percent 
increase in financial aid.
Stanford University announced 
in a February 22 press release 
that tuition will increase 5.75 
percent to $32,994, also by a flat 
rate.
Finally, DailyPrincetonian. com 
reported on February 7 that 
Princeton Universitys tuition 
will rise 4.9 percent to $42,200.
We dont want to be the most 
expensive; we want to-be in 
the middle of the pack. Cohon 
said.
Most financial aid we give to 
students who cant pay is coming 
directly from students who can 
pay.
According to the president, 
the Universitys aspirations will 
always exceed its endowment. 
He noted that it might be 
a generation before the University 
is in a place where it can institute 
system of financial aid meeting 
the total need of students.
I dont think this institution 
will ever have breathing room, 
Elliott said. People dont see how 
we can be as good as we are with 
what weve got.
Cohon noted a few specific 
uses of money accrued from 
the tuition increase and fund
raising efforts, including the 
addition of more global content 
to the curriculum, more endowed 
professorships and graduate 
fellowships, improvements in 
language education, and a 
greater pay raise for faculty. Fac
ulty saw a 2 percent pay increase 
last year.
If youve got the money, Ive 
got the ideas, said Cohon.
Carnegie Mellon admissions experiences boom in applications
APPLICATIONS, from A1
Michael Steidel, director of 
admission, attributes the rise to 
changes in both the university 
and the higher-education market
place.
Carnegie Mellon continues 
to grow in strength and stature 
as an institution internation
ally. That only helps us from an 
admission standpoint, Steidel 
said. The fact the Carnegie Mel
lon continues to grow and extend 
its influence ... will translate into 
more applications.
Steidel also noted that within 
the last year, the Office of Ad
mission has changed all of its 
communications vehicles  the 
office updated its website and 
redesigned its publications in an 
effort to more effectively commu
nicate with prospective students.
In addition to institutional
changes, Steidel noted that uni
versities that practice holistic 
admissions  like Carnegie Mel
lon  are seeing increases in 
applications. Holistic admission 
is the process of taking all parts 
of an applicants background into 
account, not basing admission on 
mathematical formulas.
Students are developing 
a stronger affinity or desire 
to attend an institution that 
takes more into consideration 
than SAT scores and class 
rank, Steidel said. Yeah, 
we look at class rank and 
SAT scores, but we also pay atten
tion to what a student does out
side of the classroom.
Applications to all departments 
have increased, which indicates 
that schools like computer sci
ence and programs like electrical 
and computer engineering and 
information systems are recovV
ering well from the decrease in 
applications they experienced 
after 9/11 and the subsequent 
dot-com bust.
[September 11] took the 
air out of the economy when 
the fastest growing sector was 
the computer industry, Steidel 
said, indicating that even before 
9/11, the computer industry was 
oversubscribed and due for a 
correction.
Essentially 9/11 was the nee
dle that burst the bubble, Steidel 
said. Its taken years to get back 
to where it should be. All areas 
that were most sensitized to that 
area of the economy are just now 
coming back to healthy levels.
William Elliott, vice president 
of enrollment, agreed, citing re
newed confidence in computer 
industries and the economy in 
general as reasons for application 
increases.
The whole issue with regard 
to the computer industry and the 
information systems industry is 
that theres been a demand, El
liot said, explaining that many 
technology companies have had 
to go overseas to find enough 
young people to meet their grow
ing needs.
I think students have 
responded to the market
place, Elliot said. We have 
seen a resurgence, just like our 
friends at other institutions, an 
increase in interest in computer 
science and engineering.
In addition to rejuvenating 
Carnegie Mellons technological 
sectors, Elliott is hopeful that the 
increase in applications will help 
the University increase the num
ber of female students.
We would like to probably 
have more women. We are always 
looking to increase the number
of women at this place, particu
larly in the technical areas and 
science, Elliott said. Everyone 
else is looking for women in en
gineering as well. Theres not a 
huge number of women that are 
interested.
The problem of too few women 
at Carnegie Mellon and similar in
stitutions is not a new one. Scott 
Carlson, a reporter for The Chroni
cle of Higher Education, reported in 
a January article that the propor
tion of computer science degrees 
awarded to women nationwide 
decreased from 19 percent in
2000 to 17 percent in 2004. 
When it comes to balancing the 
gender gap, however, Carlson cited 
Carnegie Mellon as a proactive 
institution.
In response to such findings, 
Carnegie Mellon changed the ad
missions policies for its School of 
Computer Science in 1999, Carlj
son stated. Instead of primarily 
looking for students who had prior 
programming experience, the 
University broadened its criteria 
to include students who had 
ambitious goals, who showed 
leadership skills, and, of course, 
who had excellent grades. 
After 2000, the number of 
women entering the computer 
science program went from be
low 10 percent to more than 
30 percent and has held steady 
there since.
According to Elliott, Carnegie 
Mellon is trying to solve its own 
institutional problem, but at 
the same time trying to solve a 
national problem by looking 
for ways to increase the num
ber of women in science and 
engineering.
A 20 percent increase in appli
cations, Elliot hopes, will do just 
that.

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 27, 2006
Above, Forbes House and Global Studies House have recently 
received thousands of dollars in rennovations. Kappa Sigma and 
DU will return to these houses respectively next fall.
Greek organizations regain quad housing for next year
CAMPAIGN, from A1
trouble with the University over the 
past year.
Weve done everything the Uni
versity has asked us to do, Melichar 
said.
When Kappa Sigma left campus, 
their house was turned into Forbes 
House, another first-year living 
area. According to Timothy Michael, 
director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, the change required very little 
money for cosmetic touches, such 
as painting. The house had already 
received renovations in 1999 and 
2003, totaling approximately $1.1 
million.
Students at Forbes House recog
nize the value of living there.
It feels a lot more like a house 
than a dorm, said Ryan Woodring, 
a first-year art major living in Forbes 
House. Theres a lot of first-year 
interest here. Its really family-like.
Each chapter house is on a reno
vation plan regardless of who oc
cupies it, Michael said. The Greek 
quad facilities are approximately 40 
years old with mechanical systems 
reaching the ends of their expected 
life. We have been working with the 
resident groups on renovation plan
ning since 1997.
1 think the renovations have 
been a long time coming, Melichar 
stated.
According to Michael, the reno
vation plan began in the summer of 
1999 and includes gutting and re
building the major systems of each 
Greek chapter over the next few 
years.
It made logistical sense to reno
vate these buildings first, stated 
Leonard Chan, coordinator for 
Greek Affairs.
The projects for Global Studies 
and Kappa Alpha Theta were com
bined into one project for efficiency 
and cost savings. The average per 
house was approximately $1.1 mil
lion, Michael stated.
The building that currently 
houses the sorority Kappa Alpha 
Theta received its renovation after 
Delta Tau Delta, the fraternity that 
previously inhabited it, lost its char
ter in fall 2004.
Since 1999, repairs to Sigma Nu, 
Theta Xi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Forbes 
House, and Global Studies House 
have run a total of just under $6 mil
lion. Renovations are planned for 
Beta Theta Pi and Pi Kappa Alpha by 
the end of summer 2006 at a cost of 
just over $1 million per building.
There are three pots of money 
we keep separate when running the 
housing system: The Greek quad 
pot, the sorority complex on Mar
garet Morrison pot, and a pot for 
the rest of housing  non-Greek 
housing.
Michael noted that all money 
raised and spent on Greek hous
ing comes directly from rents that 
Greek housing residents pay. No 
money comes from subsidies or con
tributions from regular residence 
hall monies, tuition, or other fees, 
he stated.
This academic year, all the rent 
and expenses from Forbes House 
and Global Studies are going into 
the Greek quad budget, even though 
they are not Greek organizations, 
Michael stated.
The students in Forbes House and 
Global Studies House pay the same 
Standard Single and Standard Dou
ble rates that apply to other living 
areas on campus.
The master plan for the Greek 
quad is for it to remain Greek 
housing, and that housing is to be 
properly renewed and extended 
consistent with proper facility and 
financial planning, Michael stated.
Greek tragedy
Two years ago, Carnegie Mellons 
Kappa Sigma chapter came under
scrutiny after reports of hazing of 
pledges emerged, including a syrup 
chug and forced house cleaning.
Representatives from Kappa 
Sigma International became con
cerned and enacted a membership 
review of the chapter  a series 
of interviews and investigations 
determining who is fit to be in the 
organization. As a result of the re
view, all but five members were ei
ther expelled or suspended from the 
fraternity.
Kappa Sigma lost their Carnegie 
Mellon charter, required for Greek 
quad housing, and would have 
a colony, as opposed to chapter 
status. To get chapter status, the 
members must participate in a 
series of fraternal education work
shops, complete a fundraiser for 
$2500, have at least 50 members, 
and complete at least 2000 hours 
of community service.
Student Life also levied penal
ties: the loss of their house on 
Morewood Avenue for two years, 
the prohibition of campus presence 
for one year, and the completion of 
2500 hours of community service. 
A final University requirement for 
returning to the quad was regaining 
a charter from their Kappa Sigma 
International.
Membership requirements, com
munity service requirements, and 
financial requirements have been 
the most difficult, stated Cale 
MacMichael-Magruder, president 
of Kappa Sigma and sophomore me
chanical engineering student.
According to Magruder, not hav
ing a place on campus made it 
difficult to recruit. A presence on 
campus is critical to the survival of 
almost any organization, he said.
This year Kappa Sigma was able 
to have a presence via special inter
est housing.
While not ideal, [it] has been 
useful, stated Magruder. Weve 
seen our recruitment efforts really
benefit.
The organization has since grown 
to approximately 50 members.
Delta Upsilon also lost their 
house this year following an inci
dent involving underage drinking in 
2004, though they did not lose their 
charter because of the occurrence. 
In response, the University revoked 
their lease for the 2005-2006 aca
demic year.
This year, some DU brothers 
have moved to campus housing 
and others have moved off campus. 
The fraternity has carried out two 
incident-free rushes since losing 
their house, but they have not held 
any other events.
According to Melichar, the DU 
brothers hope to move back into 
their house sometime this summer.
How the quad was won
Both Magruder and Melichar at
tributed each of their organizations 
successes to the support of Church, 
coordinator for Greek Affairs Lenny 
Chan, and director of Student Life 
Renee Camerlengo.
They have been nothing but sup
portive, Magruder stated.
I am excited that these groups 
were able to reach a goal they had 
set for themselves, Chan stated. I 
look forward to my continued rela
tionship with these organizations 
and their members.
Magruder also noted the nega
tive reputation that Greek life has 
at Carnegie Mellon. I am extremely 
proud of what our organization has 
accomplished, and I hope our merits 
are well known to the campus as a 
whole, he said.
Likewise, DU brothers hope to 
have a positive impact on campus.
Were just looking forward to 
moving back on campus, building 
up our membership, and rebuilding 
our ties with the campus commu
nity, Melichar said.
DiGiovanni raises bar for CMU women
PROFILE, from A1
was thus responsible for convinc
ing her sisterhood that this new 
development would be a positive 
change rather than an unwanted 
renunciation of Zeta Psi Sigmas 
own goals and values.
A few of us decided we were 
going to lead this movement, and 
we didnt know how everyone 
was going to take it, she recalled. 
But once we got it out there 
and knew that everyone was 
supportive, it became really 
exciting.
DiGiovanni attributes most 
of her confidence as a leader 
on campus to her experience in 
Greek life. I dont think thats 
what Greeks always get credit 
for, but its definitely what we are 
about, she said.
As part of this semesters Greek 
Task Force, DiGiovanni is working 
with leaders from other sororities 
and fraternities on campus to ad
dress current problems in the 
community and set goals for the 
future.
We want to promote a social 
but a more responsible atmo
sphere, DiGiovanni said. In 
the end, we will need a culture 
change, that what we present to 
the public isnt a party night on
the quad or the attitude that all 
we are about is Booth, Buggy, 
and Greek Sing.
As part of the risk management 
discussion in the Task Force, Di
Giovanni hopes to bring up the 
at-times disconcerting relation
ship between men and women 
in the Greek community. There 
are some blatant signs, including 
some fraternity rush posters, that 
show that women and men arent 
cooperating and respecting each 
other mutually.
Overall, however, DiGiovanni 
feels that the Carnegie Mel
lon community is one in which 
female leadership can thrive.
Women on this campus are 
strong leaders, and they hold 
their own, she said.
She did not begin college as an 
active feminist, but has over the 
years become deeply immersed 
in womens issues.
Ive done a 180 from religious 
and not liberal in any active 
way, to being completely liberal 
and a strong Democrat and a 
feminist. Part of it was person
ality change from not knowing 
who I was and being shy to be
ing a woman and figuring out 
my identity.
But it was an internship at 
the Women and Girls Founda
tion that has turned DiGiovanni
into a vocal advocate of womens 
issues.
This past fall she organized a 
press conference in relation to a 
protest called Girlcott. A group 
of local teens organized the pro
test against Abercrombie & Fitch 
and their line of T-shirts the girls 
perceived to be misogynistic. 
The boycott gained national at
tention, including coverage on 
CNN, and resulted in a removal 
of several of these shirts from the 
companys line.
DiGiovanni encourages future 
women at Carnegie Mellon to 
get involved on campus early 
on in their academic careers. 
Dont sit around and waste 
your college years. Stand up 
for yourself and who you are, 
whatever that might be, she 
said.
For next year, DiGiovannis 
plans include law school. Though 
she is not yet sure about the 
kind of law she wants to pursue, 
she sees womens issues and po
litical and social justice to be a 
good fit.
By exploring outward instead 
of turning inward, DiGiovanni 
is now finishing college with no 
regrets.

Study questions AP exam validity
AP, from A3
CMU, Grotzinger said.
Even stricter policies apply to 
the mathematics department. 
First-year students in every col
lege except for CFA are required 
to take a calculus assessment dur
ing the summer prior to college, 
regardless of their performance 
on the AP exam.
We have an algorithm that, 
depending on both your scores 
on the AP exam and CMU as
sessment, determines what math 
course you will be placed in, 
Grotzinger said.
After reading the studys re
sults, Grotzinger was particularly 
displeased with Sadlers claim 
that students who scored fives 
on the AP exam  but did not 
receive an A in the class  repre
sented a flaw in the AP system.
There are a lot of reasons why 
the students dont perform well 
in a class that [has] nothing to 
do with how prepared they are, 
he said. There are transition is
sues, health issues, and some of 
them know the material, but just 
choose not to study.
In last weeks article American 
math and sciences slipping, The 
Tartan reported the relevance of 
AP exams with regard to current 
policy in Washington, D.C.
With the way we ration [AP] 
courses, you would think we dont 
want students to take them, said 
Secretary of Education Marga
ret Spellings in an article by The 
Chronicle of Higher Education.
As The Tartan reported, Spell
ings spoke before the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions at a February 9 
hearing to discuss President 
Bushs American Competitive
ness Initiative.
Under the proposed initiative, 
70,000 new teachers would be 
trained to teach AP and Interna
tional Baccalaureate courses in 
math and science  an effort to 
bridge the gap in American per
formance in math and science.
I dont have much faith in 
AP exams, assistant depart
ment head of mathematics John 
Mackey told The Tartan last week. 
We need people who know how 
to think, not people who have a 
set of skills.
Meanwhile, Grotzinger firmly 
believes in the current AP system. 
He discussed what he felt to be a 
testimony of the systems success
 students who tested out of 15- 
100, the introductory Computer 
Science course, performed as well 
in 15-211 as students who had 
taken the introductory course.
This tells us that the students
who scored fives came in with all 
the knowledge that they needed 
to have, Grotzinger said.
First-year Sudeep Yegnashankaran, a CIT student, received 
a five on his Computer Science 
(AB) AP exam and tested out of 
introductory computer science 
courses 15-100 and 15-200. Cur
rently taking 15-211, he agreed 
with Grotzinger.
I feel like my high school 
course prepared me  so much 
so that, in 15-211,1 feel a sense of 
dj vu at times, he said.
Sophomore Allison Hannan, 
a chemistry and biology double 
majory felt this same sense of con
fidence in her science courses at 
Carnegie Mellon.
AP Biology and AP Chemis
try really helped a lot, Hannan 
said. I had so much background 
knowledge that it made both of 
those classes easier [for me].
Hannan is pleased with the AP 
system because it has allowed her 
to have a more flexible college 
schedule.
I get to take more classes that 
Im interested in, as opposed to 
easy introductory ones that Ive 
already taken in high school, 
Hannan said.
Grotzinger stands behind cur
rent policy. Were confident in 
the AP exam.
Service remembers Cuban pilot deaths
SILENCE, from A1
Its not only Cuban issues  its 
humanitarian aid. Caballero 
aims to provide this aid through 
fundraisers, book drives, and 
community service.
First-year biomedical engi
neering major Daniel Garcia, a 
high school friend of Caballero, 
also considers the Cuban situa
tion grim. Its just all poverty; 
theres no money going around 
anywhere, he said.
As his grandfather and grand
mother immigrated to the U.S.
in the 1960s, Caballero feels con
nected to the current situation 
in Cuba. They raised me with a 
sense of pride in where Im from, 
he said.
For Caballero, events like the 
Cuban shootdown are true awak
enings to needed change in Cuba.

Neurobiologist discovers novel treatment for seizures
by Radha Chitale
Contributing Editor
Alison Barth, assistant profes
sor of biological sciences at Carn
egie Mellon University, received 
a $50,000 grant from the Milken 
Family Foundation to further 
her research on a novel treat
ment for seizures. A drug that 
acts on a single ion channel is the 
key to this new treatment, which 
she hopes will one day be used to 
prevent seizures in children.
Barths research identified a 
specific neuronal target that, 
when blocked with the drug, 
significantly reduced seizure oc
currence and frequency in vitro. 
The real surprise came when she 
made the switch from in vitro to 
in vivo, testing the drug within a 
living organism and finding that 
it worked very well.
The target in question is an 
ion channel, a structure through 
which ions, or charged atoms, 
can cross cellular membranes. 
Ion flow in and out of nerve
cells controls the chemical and 
electrical levels necessary for 
action potentials to occur. An 
action potential is an electrical 
signal  a messenger  that 
travels from neuron to neuron, 
relaying information as it goes.
Ion channels are directly re
sponsible for electrical activity 
in a nerve cell, and malfunctions 
are a likely cause of seizures. 
Seizures occur when abnormal 
electrical activity in the brain 
results in involuntary changes 
in function or behavior. Barth
looked at graphs of action po
tentials from neurons of healthy 
mice and mice that had had sei
zures. Action potentials have 
well documented and consistent 
shapes. A normal action poten
tial would therefore look differ
ent than one recorded during a 
seizure.
Its a lot like Sesame Street, 
Barth said. They show you four 
[pictures] and say: Which one 
doesnt belong? In this way,

CMU team joins methanolpowered fuel cell research
by Hanadie Yousef
Science & Technology Editor
Carnegie Mellon is joining the 
tide of research towards creating 
a society based on an alternative 
fuel source. Prashant Kumta, a 
professor of materials sciences 
and biomedical engineering, 
together with his graduate and 
post-doctoral team is developing 
tiny fuel cells that use methanol, 
which could one day provide the 
fuel for technological appliances. 
Unlike other alternative fuel re
search projects, this one focuses 
on methanol instead of expen
sive and unstable hydrogen, 
which is difficult to mass-pro
duce and would be more difficult 
to integrate into society.
Portable electronic devices, 
such as cell phones, personal 
digital assistants and laptop 
computers, may well become 
the first widely used consumer 
items to take advantage of fuel 
cells. Instead of recharging or 
replacing batteries in these de
vices, users may one day simply 
have to refuel them.
We are developing a fuel 
cell system about the size of a 
cigarette lighter that could be 
refueled by inserting a small 
cartridge of methanol. So we are

essentially developing a more 
efficient catalyst, said Kumta in 
a Carnegie Mellon press release 
dated January 27. The metha
nol micro-scale fuel cells are so 
small they can be etched into sil
icon much like a computer chip.
The fuel cell is powered by a 
combination of methanol and 
water. When the methanol 
and water make contact with 
a catalyst in the fuel cell, they 
break down into carbon diox
ide, positively charged protons, 
and negatively charged elec
trons. The protons are attracted 
by a special membrane that 
allows them to pass through, 
while blocking the path of the 
electrons. The electrons must 
pass through an external circuit 
to get around the membrane, 
creating an electrical current. 
The fuel cell produces carbon 
dioxide, which is vented away, 
and water, which can be re
cycled to use with additional 
methanol.
We are developing 
cathode material 
for direct methanol 
fuel cell (DMFC) 
applications.

There are many obstacles that 
must be overcome in order for 
fuel cells to be commercially vi
able. Kumtas team is working 
on a variety of measures to solve 
these issues. We are develop

methanol fuel cell (DMFC) 
applications. We would like to 
develop stable support material 
for the cathode, said Daiwon 
Choi, a post-doctoral student

place where the oxygen and the 
hydrogen react, and therefore it 
is very prone to corrosion. The

Missing from Toyotas booth 
was the new Yaris, a subcom
pact car that will replace the 
Echo in 2007, boasting compact 
efficiency and a starting price 
just over $10,000.
Lexus, the luxury subdivision 
of Toyota, featured its redesigned 
IS. Many criticized the previous
IS, as it was a relabelled Japa
nese Toyota Altezza. The new IS 
was built from the ground up as 
pure Lexus. It comes as in 250 
and 350 variants: the 250 with 
a 2.5-liter V6 and the 350 with a 
3.5-liter V6. The IS350 the more 
powerful of the two, pumps out 
300 horsepower and comes only 
in rear-wheel drive. Both fea
ture the same luxury options 
that make Lexus a leader among 
luxury brands, and all models 
come with automatic transmis
sion standard.
Scion, another subdivision of 
Toyota, targets the Generation
Y market. Scion isnt offering 
any new models for 2006 (still 
the xA, xB, and tC) and isnt 
planning a major update until 
2008 at the earliest. However, 
with todays iPod-flooded mar
ket, Scion decided to incor
porate iPod capability, and its 
cars steering wheels now fea
ture audio controls. The mostanticipated performance add
on also arrived this year: the tC
supercharger. It is a factory op
tion, meaning it wont void the 
warranty, and produces 40 per
cent more horsepower and 13 
percent more torque. Scion fea
tured two corporate-sponsored 
vehicles, the Injen tC and the 
Blitz xB, both which underwent 
extensive modification. Scions 
start at around $14,000.
Nissan had some updated 
vehicles, though like Toyota, 
they didnt have the subcom

How Things Work: Magnetic induction cooktops
William Nicoll
When making dinner, do your 
ingredients come in microwaveready pouches? Do you prepare 
dinner in 30 seconds or less? If 
so, then stop reading. Youre not 
welcome here.
To the aspiring Food Network 
personalities out there, Ive got 
the secret to great cooking: heat. 
While everyone enjoys salads 
and no-bake cookies, there is 
nothing quite like a warm, wellcooked meal. Things havent 
been the same since the extracrispy rotisserie mammoth.
In the modern kitchen, the
Courtesy of design.kitchensatlanta.com
stove has become the tool of 
choice for our cooking needs. 
Stoves have a simple goal: 
convert a readily available 
form of energy into heat and 
transfer it to the food. Todays 
most readily available sources 
of energy are electricity and 
natural gas. But how is that heat 
transferred?
You are probably familiar 
with a few forms of stove-top 
heat transfer. Gas stoves trans
fer heat through a simple, 
adjustable flame. Older electric 
stoves use resistance heating, 
where a metal coil heats up 
when a current passes through
it. Fancy-schmancy households 
might even have a glass-ceramic 
stove-top, where infrared ra
diation is transmitted through a 
smooth cooking surface to pro
vide heat.
Watch out, cookware: There 
is a new sheriff in town. His 
name is induction cooking.
Instead of conducting heat 
from the cooking surface to the 
cookware, induction heating 
utilizes electromagnetism to 
actually create heat within the 
cookware. The idea is not that 
new, actually. Since the early 
90s, the technology has gained 
increasing acceptance in Japan 
and Europe. American markets 
are just warming up to the idea.
Lets turn up the heat.
If you have been (un) lucky 
enough to take an elementary 
physics course lately, you might 
know how magnetic induction 
works. If not, heres the gritty: 
When an electrical conduc
tor is placed in the presence 
of a changing magnetic field, 
electricity is produced in the 
conductor. This is the same 
phenomenon exploited in elec
trical motors and generators.
But how is this useful to 
cooking? In an induction stove, 
an electromagnet is placed un
derneath the cooking surface.
When an alternating current 
runs through the electromag
net, a rapidly changing magnetic 
field is produced. An electric 
eddy current will be gener
ated in large metal objects above 
this electromagnet, causing 
resistance heating. Unlike tra
ditional electric stoves, this re
sistance heating takes place in 
the pot itself, not in a heating 
element underneath.
This type of heating has im
portant implications for the 
cook. One of the most startling 
differences from traditional 
stoves is that the cooking sur
face doesnt get hot! Because 
heat is only generated in the 
cookware, you can lay your 
hand right over the cooking sur
face and not burn yourself. This 
is a great advantage for children 
who dont follow their parents 
advice.
Another advantage of induc
tion cooking is its responsive
ness. This is especially important 
for chefs, who demand more con
trol over their cooking than the 
average college student. By vary
ing the strength of the magnetic 
field, the heat generated in the 
pot is varied almost instantly. 
This responsiveness exceeds 
gas stoves and far exceeds tradi
tional electric stoves.
_____________________f_____
Induction stoves are also 
excelling in their efficiency. 
Because heat is generated right 
at the surface of the cookware, 
less heat is lost to the environ
ment. This equates to faster 
cooking time, cooler kitch
ens, and lower energy bills. 
Induction stoves average about 
80 percent energy efficiency, 
compared to about 50 percent 
efficiency for conventional elec
tric stoves and 30 percent effi
ciency for gas stoves. In real-life 
terms, this means the ability to 
boil water in half the time.
Unfortunately, induction 
stoves do have a big disadvan
tage: only ferrous (iron-contain
ing) cookware can be used. This 
means that only cast-iron and 
steel pots and pans will work. 
Cookware made of aluminum, 
copper, ceramic, or glass will 
stay cold atop an induction 
stove. If a magnet can stick to 
your current cookware, it is in
duction ready. If not, get ready 
to stock up on stock pots.
As competition heats up in the 
induction stove market, look for 
prices to steadily fall. Current 
models still cost several thou
sand dollars, but they remain a 
niche item. If you are shopping 
for a new stove, dont miss this 
hot new item!

Defense contractor Lockheed 
Martin is designing a jet-powered 
unmanned aircraft that launches 
from a ,submarine. Capable of 
being deployed from 150 feet un

could be outfitted with shortrange weapons or surveillance 
equipment. After completing its 
mission, the plane lands in the 
water above the submarine, and 
an underwater robotic vehicle 
launched by the sub returns the 
drone to the submarine. The 
crafts gull wings fold around the 
fuselage, allowing it to fit inside a 
seven-foot-diameter missile tube. 
Tests on a splashdown model and

University of Toronto scientists

the photons are observed by an 
outsider, the state of those pho
tons is altered, and the receiver 
can detect that the signal has been

Gay genetic factors 
may be found
A new study carried out at the 
University of California, Los An
geles, found that mothers with 
two gay sons had a much higher 
chance of a certain gene arrange
ment than mothers without gay 
sons did. The research investi
gated the functionality of the 
mothers two X chromosomes. 
In female cells, either of the two 
X chromosomes must be inactive 
for normal reproduction to occur. 
However, researchers found that 
in 23 percent of mothers with two 
gay sons, all cells DNA had the 
same X chromosome deactivated. 
This extreme skewing only occurs 
in four percent of mothers with
out gay sons, and in 13 percent of 
mothers with one gay son.
Similar research has uncov
ered other oddities in the genome 
of homosexuals, and some are 
suggesting that there are mul
tiple genetic factors involved in 
determining a persons sexual 
orientation. Instead of a single 
gay gene that determines a 
persons sexuality, some scientists 
argue that it is the combination 
of several genomic features, com
bined with environmental influ
ences, which will ultimately de
termines whether a person is gay.

you could actually learn better on 
an empty stomach.
The Yale study has shown that 
the hormone ghrelin has a direct, 
rapid, and powerful influence on 
the hippocampus, the part of the 
brain associated with learning 
and memory. Ghrelin, produced 
in the stomach, was previously 
associated with growth hormone 
release and appetite. It is released
to local neurons. It promotes al
terations in connections between 
nerve cells in mice and rats. The 
changes in neural connectivity 
are linked to enhanced learning 
and memory performance.
In other words, the hunger 
hormone ghrelin can increase 
the number of nerve connections 
in the area of the brain where 
new memories are formed, thus 
enhancing it.
Based on our observations 
in animal models, a practical 
recommendation could be that 
children may benefit from not 
overeating at breakfast in order 
to make the most out of their 
morning hours at school, Hor
vath said in a Yale press release. 
The current obesity epidemic 
among American schoolchildren, 
which to some degree has been 
attributed to bad eating habits 
in the school environment, has 
been paralleled by a decline of 
learning performance. It is how
ever too early to speculate if 
hormonal links between eating 
and learning are involved in that 
phenomenon.
High ghrelin levels or admin
istration of ghrelin-like drugs 
could also protect against certain 
forms of dementia, because ag
ing and obesity are associated 
with a decline in ghrelin levels 
and an increased incidence of 
conditions of memory loss like
METHANOL, from A5
bon degrades due to reactivity. 
We need to come up with stable 
material that will not degrade, 
said Choi.
My role is to formulate and 
test different catalyst composi
tions specifically for the anode 
side of the fuel cell, said Nico
laus Rock, a graduate student in 
the lab. Kumta and his group are 
developing nanostrtictural cata
lyst compositions that exhibit 
excellent catalytic activity and 
can also withstand other compo
nents of the fuel cell. The issue 
is that the catalyst gets poisoned 
over time  there is less catalyst 
available to facilitate the fuel cell 
reaction.
There are many advantages 
to a methanol-fuel-based sys
tem. For one, it is liquid-based. 
Take the current system. It will 
be easy to adapt and switch over 
to methanol-based. Hydrogen 
fuel would require many more 
modifications to the current fuel 
delivery systems in order to ac
commodate a hydrogen- fueled 
society. Also, the fuel cell op
erates at a lower temperature 
than other fuel cells. Solid oxide 
fuel cells, for example, operate 
at 1000 degrees Celsius, while 
DMFCs can operate at 100 de-, 
grees Celsius.
Choi has been a researcher 
in the Kumta lab for six years. 
Until the recent switch to the 
methanol fuel cell research, they 
have specialized in chemical 
synthesis, electrochemical stor
age and convergence devices, 
including lithium ion batteries,
cathode and anode materials, 
and supercapacitors. Rock has 
been a graduate student in the 
lab for almost three years, and 
has mostly concentrated on an
ode materials for lithium ion 
batteries. He has been working 
on DMFCs for three and a half 
months.
Other obstacles that must be 
overcome before fuel cells can be 
commercially available include 
the polymer electrolyte mem
brane, which is not very effi
cient. It is only supposed to allow 
hydrogen to pass through from 
the anode to the cathode, but 
some methanol leaks through. 
Therefore, a sturdier membrane 
must be developed.
There are three main aspects 
to our labs DMFC research, said 
Rock. We are focusing on im
proving the cathode, anode, and 
electrolyte membrane.
Fuel cells might be attractive 
for use in automobiles someday, 
but for now they remain prohibi
tively expensive, mainly due to 
the use of platinum in carbon 
based electrodes. On the smaller 
scale of electronics, however, fuel 
cells may soon make economic 
sense. Thats because batter
ies are an incredibly expensive 
source of power. The cost per kilo
watt of battery power is $10,000. 
An automotive engine produces 
the equivalent of a kilowatt for a 
cost of $100. It may be awhile be
fore fuel cells can compete with 
automotive power, but it is highly 
plausible to replace batteries.

October 2003 that it is devel

Barth receives grant to 
continue drug research
severe forms of epilepsy as they 
grow older. The drugs efficacy is 
another reason why Barth is ea
ger to push her research forward 
so that it can go on to clinical tri
als.
For a new drug to get to the 
clinic, it has to be commercially 
attractive, Barth said. She is cur
rently in the process of protecting 
the compound with a patent. 
However, there is still much work 
to be done before clinical trials 
start, including finding a com
pany to partner with. We would 
like to work with someone who 
will pursue this further, Barth 
said.
The grant has given Barth a big 
imperative to make progress. It 
is a one-year grant, Barth said.
Its a clinically 
exciting 
compound and 
we are trying 
to get it to the 
clinic as soon as 
possible.
Alison Barth
We received the money very 
quickly and therefore we can 
really do a lot of experiments to 
investigate this.
Barth hopes her research ad
vances will help her obtain a 
larger grant from the National 
Institutes of Health. She is also 
looking for other sources of fund
ing. Its a clinically exciting 
compound, Barth said, and we 
are trying to get it to the clinic as 
soon as possible.
The progression of this project 
was a tribute to basic research 
and persistence, Barth said. 
It has spawned a dozen other 
projects in the lab. Future re
search projects for her lab in
clude examining the possibility 
of predicting if and when spon
taneous recurrent seizures will 
develop. Those seizures could 
then be prevented with Barths 
innovative treatment.
BARTH, from A5
Barth was able to identify which 
ion channel was responsible for 
the recorded changes in action 
potentials during a seizure.
Barth noted that the chances 
of having a seizure in a lifetime 
are very low, around one percent. 
However, one seizure increases 
the likelihood of a second 50- 
fold. The chances of having a 
third seizure increase by 80 to 90 
percent, and the numbers con
tinue to rise.
Spontaneous recurrent sei
zures, commonly known as 
epilepsy, affect between 1.4 and 
2.7 million people in the U.S., 
according to the Centers for Dis
ease Control and Prevention.
Barth hopes to interrupt the 
development of epilepsy from 
recurrent seizures. Im a new
comer to the epilepsy field, Barth 
said. The grant allows research
ers with novel ideas and new 
approaches a chance to explore.
To test its efficacy, Barth in
jected the drug into mice, though 
still unsure of the rate at which 
it would be metabolized or the 
likelihood that it would cross the 
blood-brain barrier to reach neu
rons. After several trials, Barth 
found that administering the 
drug concurrently with seizure 
induction effectively eliminated 
all seizures. We stumbled 
upon this finding, Barth said. 
I just asked a student try the 
experiment.
Barth pointed out that the core 
discovery was that this par
ticular target treatment could 
prevent seizures in vivo. That is, 
the drug could be administered 
to a living animal and produce 
results.
It is likely to be an orally ad
ministered drug, based upon the 
compounds structure, although 
we havent tried it, Barth said. 
And it might be effective for peo
ple at,risk of developing epilepsy 
and could be a therapy to prevent 
epileptogenesis.
This is good news, particularly 
for young children, who make 
up a third of all newly diagnosed 
cases of epilepsy each year and 
are in danger of developing more

Freedom of the press must

30 deaths. Newspapers should report 
on this, and they have. They also have a 
responsibility to show what has brought 
about these protests. A newspaper has 
to decide what topics should be covered 
in each issue, but it should seek to in
form, not indoctrinate. It can say that 
other people found the cartoons offen
sive, but by preventing the readers from 
drawing their own conclusions from the 
cartoons, it does a disservice to its read
ers. Though some may be offended, the 
importance of the news outweighs the 
offense that it engenders.
One newspaper, the Boston Phoenix, 
was blunt with its reasons for not re
printing the cartoons. The primary 
reason that they did so was [o]ut of 
fear of retaliation from the international 
brotherhood of radical and bloodthirsty 
Islamists who seek to impose their will 
on those who do not believe as they do. 
Its honesty is welcome at a time when 
respected news organizations like CNN 
claim that they will not reprint the car
toons out of respect for Islam while they 
do reprint anti-Semitic cartoons that 
are just as offensive. This double stan
dard is nothing new. Andres Serranos 
Piss Christ (1989) and Chris Ofilis 
The Holy Virgin Mary (1996), made 
with elephant dung as an ingredient, of
fended Christians across the world, but 
news organizations saw nothing wrong 
with republishing them. The largest of 
the protests had to do with the public 
funding of such art. Even with these 
protests, the majority of Christians who 
were offended by this art recognized 
that their creators had a right to create 
it, just as they have a right to celebrate 
their religion.
The refusal of most newspapers to 
stand in solidarity with Jyllands-Posten 
is only a single symptom of this moral 
cowardice. Googles and Yahoos choice 
to collaborate with the Chinese gov
ernment in its attempts to censor in
formation, CNNs censorship of the 
situation within Iraq as described by 
Easton Jordan in his New York Times 
article The News We Kept to Ourselves 
 all these result in the erosion of our 
freedoms as we choose the path of con
venience over the sometimes rocky road 
of free expression. The greatest risk to 
free speech comes not from the govern
ment, but the voluntary self-censorship 
of those who profess to believe in free 
speech.

The publication in September 2005 
of 12 editorial cartoons depicting 
Muhammad set off a firestorm of con
troversy. Thousands of people in the 
Middle East and the rest of the world 
protested these cartoons, some of which 
commented negatively on Islam. Despite 
this, most of us cannot say that weve 
seen these cartoons. News organiza
tions in the U.S. have, for the most part, 
chosen not to print or display them.
This decision is entirely within their 
rights. News organizations choose what 
is newsworthy and write their stories 
accordingly. However, that freedom 
brings with it a great responsibility. A 
newspaper should never seek to offend, 
but it should not fear doing so in pursuit 
of a greater good.
In modern Western society, there 
is a separation between church and 
state that is not seen in many Muslim 
societies. Saudi Arabia, as an example, 
prohibits public worship of religions 
other than Islam, and atheism and apos
tasy (conversion to another religion) 
are both capital crimes. Depictions of 
the prophet Muhammad are seen by 
.many modern Muslims as being close to 
idolatry, something prohibited by Islam 
(as well as Christianity and Judaism). 
Even without this, any criticism of 
Muhammad can be construed as blas
phemy, another crime that is punishable 
by the death penalty. If the offender is 
lucky, he might merely be convicted 
of insulting Islamic values and serve a 
five-year sentence.
The cartoons were originally pub
lished by the newspaper Jyllands-Posten 
in Denmark as part of an article discuss
ing the boundaries of free speech and 
how Islam should not receive special 
treatment in the media. Forty cartoon
ists were approached to draw their views 
on Muhammad, and 12 responded. Six 
of these cartoons were reprinted dur
ing Ramadan in El-Fagr, an Egyptian 
newspaper that accompanied the car
toons with an article denouncing them. 
Interestingly, no known protests by the 
Egyptian government or Egyptian re
ligious authorities resulted from this 
republication.
Other newspapers, most of them 
European, have since reprinted the car
toons. Protests against the cartoons and 
the newspapers who chose to reprint 
them have followed, along with at least

Success is about more than 
just Olympic gold medals
Sometimes, something as great as the 
opportunity to win the Olympic gold 
medal is worth passing up when cir
cumstances prevent you from doing the 
things that you want. Im not going 
to lie, though. Seeing Michelle cou
rageously face the media with tears 
glistening in her eyes was hard for me 
too. Its difficult  if not downright 
discouraging  to see someone walk 
away from the very thing shes worked 
so hard and so long to achieve.
Seeing someones dream getting 
crushed is a disheartening feeling. It 
makes you wonder whether we our
selves are chasing after our own elusive 
gold medal. And if we are, should we 
just give up, or continue plowing bravely 
forward, knowing that the chance for 
failure greatly exceeds our one and only 
chance for success?
I find the concept of the American 
Dream to be unrealistically optimistic. 
According to this model, as long as 
someone is dedicated and hard-working,

Ever since Michelle Kwan announced 
her decision to withdraw from the 
Olympics, all weve heard from the 
media is how tragic her story is. True, 
Michelle has been on the quest for the 
so-called elusive gold medal for about 
a decade. Indeed, its saddening to hear 
of all the injuries that shes sustained in 
her noteworthy journey. However, we 
must consider that maybe withdrawing 
from the Olympics may not be as bad as 
the press makes it out to be.
They say that its better to fail than to 
not try at all. In Michelle Kwans case, 
she tried, she didnt fail, but she didnt 
win the Olympic gold medal either. 
In the minds of her fans, Michelle is a 
winner.
If anything, Michelle Kwans big de
cision to withdraw from the Olympics 
tells us that its okay to just walk away.See KWAN, page A9

THE TARTAN  FEBRUARY 27, 2006
Danish cartoon controversy and Islam: 
An American Muslims perspective
_______________________Khalid El-Arini
When I first heard that a Danish newspaper, 
Jyllands-Posten, had published inflammatory car
toons of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon 
him), my initial reaction was of great disappoint
ment and sadness. I was deeply troubled by the fact 
that the editorial board of a supposedly respectable 
newspaper would publish such content, despite 
knowing that nearly a quarter of the worlds popula
tion would find it greatly offensive. As a Muslim and 
as an American, I was raised to always respect the 
religious beliefs of others. This universal principle 
that we hold so dear in this country was egregiously 
disregarded by the newspapers editors.
In no way do I support censoring free speech. 
Jyllands-Posten had the legal right to publish the 
cartoons, but as The Tartan itself found out two 
years ago, there is a responsibility that comes along 
with that right.
Contrary to what some may think, there is 
nothing inherently un-Islamic about freedom of 
expression. Certainly Islam is not the only religion 
with prohibitions on lying, cursing, and blasphemy; 
in modern society, this has never been a barrier to 
free discourse.
The reason the cartoons are so offensive is 
twofold. First, the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) preached 
monotheism to an extremely idolatrous society, and 
in order to emphasize that it is God that should be 
Worshipped and not him, he explicitly banned his 
followers from creating any drawings or sculptures 
that might later be misinterpreted as having divine 
qualities. This explains why Muslims find even the 
tamest of these drawings to be abhorrent. Second, 
the Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) was the living 
embodiment of Islam. He was a man of impeccable 
character, and Muslims around the world strive to 
emulate his excellent example. Thus, for Muslims, 
an attack on our beloved prophet is an attack on the 
foundations of our faith.
Therefore, in addition to being disgusted with 
Jyllands-Posten, I was disgusted at those that would 
respond to an attack on their prophet with lawless
ness and violence, which ironically only acted to 
reinforce what one cartoon implied. If they in fact 
loved the Prophet (p.b.u.h.), as they claimed, they 
would follow his example, and his example could 
not be further from their actions. Throughout his 
life, the Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) was often 
persecuted for his beliefs, but in response, he al
ways took the high road. There are countless stories 
of times when he faced incredible adversity, but one 
immediately comes to mind.
Once, the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) traveled from Mecca 
to the Arabian city of Taif to preach his message 
and find sanctuary for his persecuted followers. 
Instead, his preaching fell on deaf ears, and the chil
dren of the town were sent to pelt him with stones. 
His body covered in blood, he eventually made it to 
safety outside the city limits and was approached by 
the angel Gabriel, who informed him that God was 
willing to punish those who had caused him such 
suffering, if the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) so desired. In a 
noble display of patience and mercy, the Prophet 
(p.b.u.h.) declined, for he held out hope that per
haps one day, even just one of the towns children 
might grow up to believe in his message.
This stands in stark contrast to the events that un
folded in the Middle East over the past few weeks, 
and begs the question: If the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) was 
so merciful, why is it that some of his supposed fol
lowers are so ill-tempered and prone to chaos?
First, it is important to note that although much 
attention has been given to the ignorant few 
whose actions were inexcusable, the vast majority 
of Muslims around the world reacted peacefully 
and responsibly. For instance, there are an esti
mated 7 million Muslims living in America, and 
save for perhaps some Steelers fans, none of them 
could be found on the streets wreaking havoc. 
The Philadelphia Inquirer shamefully reprinted the 
cartoons a few weeks ago, and the Muslim com
munity of that city staged a large and dignified 
protest. This was the case, by and large, all around 
the world. Second, to answer this question is to 
take a deep look at the sociopolitical realities that 
exist in the Middle East  something that I am not 
nearly fully qualified to do. However, I feel that the 
pent-up rage that these people develop from living 
under oppressive regimes, when coupled with their 
strong belief that there is a global war being waged 
against Islam, provides for a mob easily cajoled into 
wrongdoing.
When the public eye is focused on radicals that 
would hijack my faith, I find myself as an American 
Muslim struggling for the noble soul of my religion. 
I cannot sit idly by and let these people dictate to 
the world what it means to be Muslim. My response 
has always been to educate others about my beliefs, 
and to become even more involved in my commu
nity and civic society than I already am.
We Muslims need to learn more about our reli
gion by studying the life of the Prophet (p.b.u.h.), 
so that maybe  just maybe  in the future, if 
such a provocation repeats itself, these people ri
oting overseas will first ask themselves: WWMD? 
What would Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) do? And then 
maybe just maybe  when others hear the word 
Muslim and try to conjure a mental image, rather 
than some scruffy fanatic they instead picture their 
Virginia-born Muslim friend from Carnegie Mellon 
with a penchant for country music.
Khalid El-Arini (kbe@), a graduate student in com
puter science, is on the Executive Board of the Muslim 
Students Association. He welcomes all responsible 
replies, except those that make fun of him for listening 
to country music.
_____________________Benjamin Hackett
The body count continues to rise in fundamental
ist Islams latest attack on a Western ideal: freedom 
of speech. Rioters have taken to the streets holding 
signs saying Death to Freedom and Freedom go 
to Hell. While the offending cartoons, depicting 
the prophet Muhammad, originated in Denmark, 
any other Western embassies or innocent bystand
ers in the way have been attacked at will.
Those that argue that this is a fundamentalist 
hijacking of the religion are absolutely correct. Yet, 
when the hijacking argument expands to include 
the phrases just a small percentage and not very 
representative, this is where reality and rhetoric 
part ways.
The violence has not been limited to one region of 
the world. Riots have spread throughout the globe 
from India to Nigeria to Denmark to Afghanistan. 
Just like traditional peaceful demonstrations in 
Western nations, many people took to the streets to 
air their grievances. Unfortunately, the destruction 
of property and lives soon followed.
The death toll continues to rise. Eleven are dead 
in Afghanistan. Three people, including an eightyear-old child, are dead in Pakistan. Ten people 
are dead in Libya. In northern Nigerian territories, 
where the resident Muslims refuse to live by the 
Western-style law governing the rest of the coun
try, over 45 people are dead, including a Catholic 
priest.
Remember, this is over an editorial cartoon pub
lished in September of 2005.
Supposedly, the depiction of the prophet 
Muhammad is fueling these riots. However, the 
Islamic law regarding depictions of the prophet 
is, by its very definition, not applicable to Western 
institutions practicing freedom of speech. The pro
hibition is only restrictive concerning renderings 
produced by Muslims.
There are those more interested in fueling the 
fire and destroying Western institutions than in 
defending the honor of Islam. In one instance, up to 
$1 million was offered to anyone who kills an artist 
of one of the Muhammad cartoons. Other offers in
clude lump sums of money and material goods such 
as cars. The traditional offering of 72 virgins is, as 
of yet, nowhere to be found.
There is another alarming element in this latest 
breakout of anti-Western violence. Some of these 
protests are not simple individual displays of igno
rance: They are state-backed, or sometimes stateincited, ignoramuses on parade.
At a recent news conference, Secretary of State 
Condolezza Rice denounced those governments 
that have attempted to exploit this controversy for 
ideological gain. Iran and Syria have gone out of 
their way to inflame sentiments and to use this to
their own purposes, and the world ought to call 
them on it, she said. The evidence is strong enough 
for these governments to be called out on a world 
stage.
Many of these alleged protests are directed by 
states with political investments made in removing 
Western influence in their region. Threatened by 
the promises of freedom of speech, freedom of the 
press, and representative democracy, these states 
sponsor unrest to divert attention from their own 
actions.
If the enemy of fundamentalist Islam is Western 
civilization, then freedom and the ability to choose 
the direction of ones life are adversaries of funda
mentalist Islam as well. Freedom of speech would 
loosen the grip of those radical clerics seeking to 
promote their interests by stoking the flames of 
these riots.
An objective lens in the region would expose the 
inequities and gaps between the leadership and 
their willing flock of suicide sheep.
Uncle bin Laden wants you. Radical clerics call 
dying in holy war martyrdom, noble, and worth
while. Yet, in his latest VH1 terrorist pop-up video, 
Osama bin Laden vows never to be captured alive, 
wanting never to find the bitter taste of death. 
Hypocrisy?
The command and control structure of both ter
rorist organizations and fundamentalist political 
groups, with terrorist wings, requires extensive 
indoctrination from an early age. Propagandizing 
the populous is a necessary tool to reign in dis
sent. Censorship, such as the Iranian blocking of 
Western entertainment, is a necessary tool to keep 
recruitment levels high for organizations such as 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the multinational 
terrorist actor al-Qaeda.
The cartoons allegedly offensive content includes 
renderings of violence. Ironically, the protests over 
the associations of the prophet Muhammad with 
violence are both violent and deadly themselves.
As in past instances, condemnations of the vio
lence have been slow in coming. In the rare case 
that an Islamic cleric does condemn the killings, the 
censure is preceded with some indignant form of 
the phrase We are saddened by the choice to anger 
one quarter of the worlds population, but we also 
condemn....
The base fact is that freedom of speech, of the 
press, and of the people are directly detrimental to 
the fundamentalist goal of establishing a worldwide 
Islamic state, a state ruled by Islamic law.
Kudos to all dedicated journalists and fans of 
Western civilization, who, whether with good or 
bad taste, continue to defend these precious institu
tions. Suppress freedom of speech in a holy war for 
only 72 virgins? Start me at 73, and then well talk.

in the end, anything is possible. Based on 
this model, all dreams can come true, 
regardless of how extraordinary they 
are. All you need is x and y to reach 
z. Its as simple as that  until reality 
sets in.
Im not saying that the American 
Dream is impossible. If anything, hard 
work and dedication will get you results. 
Results in what, though, vary by the
magnitude of the dream, and are to be 
determined on an individual basis.
What people need to realize is that the 
American Dream is merely a model for 
success, and as a model, it fails to con
sider the occurrence of random events 
such as injuries, deaths, or other hard
ships.
No model is perfect. No dream is un
achievable. What these two seemingly 
contrary ideas tell us is that life is just a 
series of random events, thrown together
so that sometimes you end up with a 
winning streak, and other times your 
luck runs out.
In Michelles case, it wasnt that she 
didnt work hard enough. It wasnt that 
she wasnt 100 percent committed to 
her goal. Her luck simply ran out at 
an inopportune moment. Nevertheless, 
her humble exit from the race for the 
esteemed gold medal proved that at 
that moment, Michelle Kwan was not 
someone who gave up out of fear, but
someone who bowed out gracefully out 
of respect for the game. That in itself 
is worth more than a hundred Olympic 
gold medals.
Not everyone can be an Olympic gold 
medalist. Not everyone ends up being the 
CEO of Microsoft. But when people like 
Michelle Kwan get passed up for a gold 
medal, I find it more and more difficult 
to believe that hard work and persever
ance is the formula for success. Especially 
because the Olympic gold medal is such
a prestigious symbol of achievement, 
when it is denied to a highly-deserving 
individual, for me, the gold medal starts 
to lose its value and appeal. After all, we 
should know by now that greatness can
not be reflected in a single piece of cold, 
hard metal.

As the spring semester be
gins, cold nights descend over 
campus and warmth becomes 
a commodity that most cannot 
afford to pass up, sending stu
dents rushing from building 
to building as quickly as pos
sible, but not the members of 
the Carnegie Mellon alpine ski 
team.
They thrive in the cold, pray 
for snow, and drive hours every 
weekend looking for a small 
drop in temperature. For them, 
the first five weekends of spring 
semester  Friday through 
Sundaywere spent out in the 
cold, trying to create a place for 
Carnegie Mellon in competitive 
skiing.
Formed this winter by senior 
co-captains Hugh Dunn and 
Alex Sussman, the ski team is 
currently an extension of the 
Carnegie Mellon ski and snow
board club. It is run by students, 
coached by the captains, and 
funded mostly through mem
ber fundraising.
Carnegie Mellons division in 
ski racing is extremely competi
tive, and many of the member 
schools take alpine racing very 
seriously. Schools such as West 
Virginia University, Davis & El
kins College, and Pennsylvania 
State University all have skiers 
who come from ski academies 
 schools built with the explicit 
purpose of training students to 
ski. In addition, many of these 
teams have ski camps where 
they practice with a coach hired 
to train each student on the 
technical aspects of alpine rac
ing. While the Carnegie Mellon 
ski team does not have some of 
these perks, they did better in 
their inaugural year than any
one could have ever asked.
When the final results came 
in, Carnegie Mellon placed 
sixth out of the 10 schools in 
their division. But according to 
members of the team, this was
not the biggest victory of the 
season.
Successful skiing can be 
measured by the fastest time 
down the slope, but there are 
other measures of success that 
are much more complicated. 
What makes this conference 
so successful is the interaction 
between teams. Daniel Chen, a 
senior electrical and computer 
engineering major, said, Its 
provided us a competitive at
mosphere, but where everyone 
can relax and have a good time 
while improving their skiing 
ability. Although the name of 
the game is competition, it is 
extremely common to see team 
members giving tips and ad
vice to individuals from other 
teams. The advice and pointers 
from other schools coaches are 
so common that maybe Carne
gie Mellons team does not even 
need a coach.
Because of the nature of ski
ing, team members spend a 
good amount of time contribut
ing not only to their own teams 
success, but to the success of 
the conference as a whole. Run
ning a skiing event costs a lot of 
money, in addition to requiring 
a significant amount of staff. 
Due to monetary constraints, 
each team contributes as much 
as possible. This strengthens 
the bond between teams and 
among skiers.
In light of the teams success, 
next years captain first-year An
thony Cartolano hopes to start 
a womens team to complement 
the mens team. I just want 
people to realize how awesome 
this is, he said, coming off the 
slopes after a race. Im so ex
cited for next year already.
With the ski season ending, 
one can only hope to see even 
greater success on the slopes 
next year.
If you have further questions 
about or are interested in joining 
the ski team, please write Alex 
Sussman at ahsussma@andrew.

27 February 2006 THE TARTAN Al2
Mens and womens tennis 
handily serve Case a defeat
by Jeffrey Wang
Stqffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens tennis teams came 
up with victories over Case 
Western Reserve University on 
Saturday. The Tartans dominat
ed the competition with a clean
7-0 sweep for the men and an
8-1 victory for the women. It was 
an important win for the 22ndseeded Tartan mens team, which 
bounced back from previous close 
losses to secure a blowout win. 
The Tartan womens team also 
won by a large margin, winning 
all of their matches except one.
The mens performance was led 
by third and fifth singles Stephen 
Kuhn and Spencer Svetcov, who 
both collected crucial wins for 
the Tartan men. Svetcov came 
up big with the win after a gruel
ing three-set match (6-3, 5-7, 
7-6(5)), edging his opponent in 
the final set via tiebreaker. First 
singles Yiran Liu also had a strong 
performance, winning the only 
two-set match for the men with 
a score of 7-6(4), 6-1. Another 
notable performance from the 
singles team came from second 
singles Andrew Clearfield, who 
bounced back from a second set 
1-6 setback with a 6-4 perfor
mance to secure the win.
Complementing the successful 
run for the Tartan mens singles, 
the mens doubles also came
up big with Svetcov and Ryan 
Thompson teaming up as third 
doubles to pull out a close match 
of 8-6. First doubles Liu and Carl 
Yang cruised with a score of 8-5, 
while second doubles Kuhn and 
Clearfield beat the opposition 
with a lopsided 8-3 win.
The women carried momen
tum from their six-game winning 
streak to extend the run, accent
ing their victory with a very 
impressive win by third singles 
Kelly Nakamura. The normally 
fifth singles Nakamura was in 
complete control of her game 
as she defeated the Case third 
singles with a 6-1, 6-0 perfor
mance. Similarly, first singles 
Mona Iyer beat her opponent 
6-0, 6-1 and fifth singles Claire 
Weiss won 6-1, 6-0. All of the 
other Tartan women also secured 
their wins in straight sets. The
womens doubles were equally 
successful in helping the Tartans 
extend their winning streak, 
with first doubles Iyer and Amy
Staloch leading the doubles team 
with a 8-2 triumph.
The men are at their best per
formance of the year, said head 
coach Andy Girard about the 
Tartans impressive sweep. They 
have really stepped up their per
formance to get us the win. The 
coach also had very positive com
ments for the women, who now 
are ranked 12th in the nation. 
The women have continued to 
play very well, however, we have 
a big match coming up against 
ranked-second Washington & Lee 
University, he said, but he is opti
mistic about the teams upcoming 
match. On both sides we have 
our best teams we have ever had; 
it will be a good chance to assert 
ourselves as the best team in the 
country. The Tartans will com
pete against Washington & Lee 
University on March 4.
On both sides we have our best 
teams we have ever had.

Tough end to a difficult season
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon womens 
basketball team capped off their 
2005-2006 season on Saturday 
when they hosted University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
opponent University of Rochester. 
The visiting Yellowjackets, ranked 
in the top 25 earlier in the season, 
were too much for the Tartans 
as Carnegie Mellon fell 66-41 on 
Senior Day in Skibo Gymnasium.
Graduating seniors Dava 
Sommermeyer, Rebecca Shore, 
and Melissa DeAngelo were hon
ored before the game, and all 
three started for the Tartans. 
Sommermeyer led the Tartans 
with nine points, including the 
last three points of the season 
when she drove the lane with 1:11 
left, scored, and drew a foul. Shore 
pulled down a team-high eight 
rebounds to complement her four 
points, and DeAngelo contributed 
seven points and four rebounds in 
the loss.
The Tartans played hard 
throughout, but they could not 
keep up with the Yellowjackets 
speed and athleticism. DeAngelo 
started the scoring when she con
nected on a three-pointer with 
18:47 left in the first half to give 
the Tartans a 3-0 lead. First-year 
guard Gemma Easterling made a 
jumper to give the Tartans their 
last lead of the game; 5-3, at the 
18:10 mark. Rochester, behind 
solid shooting and good ball con
trol, pulled away, at this point, 
as in the first half they shot 45.2 
percent from the field compared 
to the Tartans 32 percent, while 
committing only six turnovers to 
Carnegie Mellons 14 en route to a 
42-22 halftime lead.
Rochester is a solid athletic 
team, and we came out slow in the 
first half, said sophomore guard 
Leah Feola. Once they had the 
lead on us it was difficult to get it 
back. The UAA is a very

tive conference with many nation
ally ranked teams.
In the second half, both teams 
had trouble putting the ball in the 
basket. For Rochester, this includ
ed a 20-minute block spanning 
from the 5:07 mark in the first half 
to under the five-minute mark in 
the second half where they went 
2-26 from the field. The Tartans 
were able to cut the lead down to 
45-34 with 12:56 remaining on 
Feolas creative basket, but despite 
numerous attempts, they were not 
able to get any closer the rest of 
the way, and the Yellowjackets 
going on to win by 25.
Overall the season 
a learning
well in the beginning, until we lost 
our starting point guard [Stacie 
Aleski] due to injury. This pushed 
our team development back 
tremendously. Moreover, a lot of 
freshmen were playing significant 
minutes against nationally ranked 
teams. The seniors were great 
team leaders, and they will be 
missed next year. However, the 
returning players are eager to take 
over. Next year we will be more 
experienced and prepared for 
UAA play.
The loss puts the Tartans at 5-20 
overall and 0-14 in the UAA to fin

Its a slam dunk!
Tartan men clinch the UAA Championship
by Colin Liotta
Staffwriter
For the first time in school 
history, the Carnegie Mellon 
mens basketball team won the 
UAA conference championship 
and received an automatic bid 
to the NCAA Division III playoffs 
by defeating conference rival 
Rochester 78-68 on Saturday. 
This marks only the second time 
in school history that the team has 
gone to the NCAA Tournament; 
last berth came in 1977.
In front of a packed crowd at 
Skibo Gymnasium, the Tartans 
started off by honoring the teams 
five seniors and their parents on 
Day. Rachel Gross, the 
Tartans senior scorebook keeper 
and the singer of the national 
anthem and God Bless America, 
Was also honored for her con
tributions to the team over the 
years. . , 
The opening minutes of the 
ne saw the two teams batg to take control with neither 
team gaining a significant lead. 
However, the Tartans went on a 
13-2 run, capped off by an em
phatic dunk by senior Bary Dunn, 
to take an 18-11 lead. The Tartan
men would never relinquish their 
lead, as they finished the first 
half shooting 50 percent from 
the field, including 7 of 11 threepointers, to take a 43-26 lead at 
the end of the half.
The Tartans continued to pour 
it on in the second half, lead
ing by as much as 24. Despite 
the strong second-half perfor
mance by Rochester center Jon 
Onyiriuka, who scored 18 of his 
team-high 31 points in the second 
half, Rochester wasnt able to cut 
the lead to less than nine points.
As time expired, the crowd 
at Skibo Gymnasium gave their 
team a standing ovation to a 
historical season that has seen 
an upset victory over Princeton 
and the Tartans first 20-win sea
son in school history. The team 
celebrated by spraying water 
into the air and cutting down the 
nets.
It was a big game for us, not 
only because it was for the con
ference title, but also because it 
was Senior Day and we wanted 
to get these guys a win, said 
sophomore guard Geoff Kozak. 
And today, the seniors led us to 
victory.
Senior Nate Maurer led the 
Tartans with 16 points. All the
Tartan seniors contributed in the 
game, combining to score 63 of 
the teams 78 points  including 
14 from Dunn, who shot six of 
seven from the field. Senior and 
co-captain Clayton Barlow-Wilcox 
chipped in with 12 points and 
eight rebounds, giving him 599 
rebounds for his career. Marques 
Johnson had eight points, five re
bounds, and five assists, while 
co-captain A.J. Straub scored 
13 points, including three bas
kets from behind the arc. Straub 
extended his school record to 
28 straight games with a threepointer, which dates back to last 
season.
It was a great way for us to end 
the regular season, said Straub. 
To win it all in front of the home 
crowd on Senior Day means a 
lot.
The Tartans must now wait 
to see who and where they will 
play in the NCAA Division III 
Tournament. The information 
will be released today, and the 
team could be in action Thursday 
or Friday.
We worked hard all season to 
finish as conference champions, 
said Barlow-Wilcox. But now we 
have to work even harder as we go 
into tournament play.

Dr. Ruth talks sex with CMU
MOSAIC brings famed sex psychotherapist to campusDid you know?
First thoughts? The accent is real.
I used to be a kindergarten teacher," Dr. Ruth, 
MOSAIC 2006's keynote speaker, said, stepping 
her 47 frame up to the podium, "so I know how 
to do this.
Part of me really wished shed already been talking 
about sex at that point.
In keeping with this years Milestones theme, Dr. 
Ruth Westheimer shared many key moments from 
her life  from her early childhood in Frankfurt, 
her adolescence in a Swiss children's home, and 
her experience in the 
predecessor of the Israeli 
Defense Force. Her first 
marriage led her to Paris, 
where she directed a 
kindergarten and studied 
psychology at the 
Sorbonne. She had to pass 
a placement test because 
she lacked a high school 
diploma. Apparently, 
they only taught the girls 
home economics at the 
orphanage. Now, shes 
an award-winning author 
with all kinds of official 
and honorary doctorates. So it goes.
Before this morning, the most I knew of Ruth 
Westheimer was my brother's impersonation the 
last time our family played Cranium. I knew about 
the accent. I know that, to some, the concept of 
sex psychotherapy is a joke. Entering a lecture, 
titled Soldier, Sex Therapist, & Mother of the 
Year: Milestones in the Life of Dr. Ruth, I scoffed 
about my disinterest in her life and history to 
some friends. You know, before I learned shed 
single-handedly conquered life against all odds.
So, what, Im superficial, and maybe a little 
sex-starved. But I wasnt the only one in that 
audience who was really just there to hear 
about orgasms  and Dr. Ruth seemed to know 
that. She said she had gotten hired at Planned 
Parenthood and thought, There's something 
wrong with these people  all they ever talk 
about is sex, not literature or politics. She 
quickly changed her mind.
It wasn't until the latter half of the session that 
Dr. Ruth started talking about the topic we 
were all waiting for. She described herself as 
a turtle  you can only move if you stick your 
neck out, right? But that leaves you vulnerable. 
She said she was very explicit, but actually old 
fashioned and a square. When her late husband 
Fred was still alive, she never let him sit in on 
any of her talks, except for that one time she 
was on 60 Minutes. Fred was wild about Diane 
Sawyer, who'd asked, "Mr. Westheimer, how is 
your sex life?" To which Fred had replied, The 
shoemakers children don't have any shoes."
I see that Carnegie 
Mellon listens very 
carefully when I talk 
about sex.
Dr. Ruth Westheimer
I appreciated Dr. Ruths frankness and her 
unassuming attitude. I mean, its not like she was 
forcing anything on us. She said, the more we  
talk, the less we will have problems, attempting 
to dispel some common myths about sexuality
 one being that American women dont 
masturbate. Others being that if you masturbate, 
your hair falls out, youll end up needing glasses, 
and hair grows on your palms. She complimented 
the self-control of Carnegie Mellon students 
at this point, because apparently everyone at 
Harvard Law looked at their hands when she said 
that.
Westheimer talked 
about her experience 
writing Sex for 
Dummies and how 
she hadnt been 
interested when they 
first approached her, 
saying, "No, I talk to 
intelligent people
 people who ask 
questions about how 
her background as 
an orthodox Jew has 
affected her advice 
to others. She said, 
clearly, to do as your 
values decree. Each individual has to make 
decisions about abstinence and his own sexuality 
for himself.
Still, "sex sells," and Dr. Ruth talked about that 
too, claiming shes the first to pick a new sexy 
headline up off the newsstands, because God 
forbid you should know something about sex 
that I dont know. Certainly nobody complained 
when she assigned us all homework: for women, 
sit in your car, doing your Kegel exercises 
(clenching and unclenching the vaginal muscles) 
at a red light. Then look into the car next to you 
and wink. Men were instructed to go home, 
bring themselves to a full erection in front of a 
mirror and stand there for a while, admiring it. 
Additional homework involved making a CD of all 
the important music in your life for your children 
and grandchildren. Those with partners were told 
to go home and try.a new position.
Westheimer had opened her talk by inviting 
students to write questions on cards to be 
answered at the end of her session. She 
encouraged audience members to fill the first 
rows, promising them a lifetime of good sex. "I 
see that Carnegie Mellon listens very carefully 
when I talk about sex, she said later, "especially 
the ones who moved forward. You can call me 
tomorrow and tell me if it worked."
I was still sitting in the back.

The Greek Sing and Swing was kicking its heels 
high again at Carnegie Mellon. Music and dancing 
were all the rage as 19 fraternities and sororities 
joined for the fourth annual Sing and Swing. Music 
provided included everything from spirituals to 
Rogers and Hart, and The Tartan proclaimed that 
it was good listening for all." Gee golly, sounds 
like a regular toe-tapping riot.
Several residents of Morewood gave their own 
commentary on food services by placing a sign in 
their window that proclaimed that neither the food 
service, nor hookers, tasted good, despite their 
high prices. Memo to self - Skip both Si Senor 
and Club Coochie this evening.
The Tartan commented on attire for such events 
as formals at Carnegie Mellon. The Tartan warned 
that you might be the victim of nasty phrases like 
Let me tell you, that dress leaves nothing to the 
imagination if you made a fashion faux pas. They 
said it like it was a bad thing. Pish.
A new plan was announced to build a dormitory 
hall between Mudge and Morewood Gardens. At 
the time, there were high hopes that perhaps we 
could name it something fun like The House of 
Pain or Hufflepuff or Cool Kid Castle. But in 
their typical unimaginative fashion, they called it... 
New House. Woo hoo! Carnegie Mellon is such a 
bucket of fun.
A story in our Science & Technology section taught 
us all about distilling vodka. We also learned fun 
facts about, for example, potato vodkas: The 
Tartan wrote that potato vodkas have a slightly 
sweeter taste than grain vodkas. In other news, 
the O is out of French fries, and your suitemate 
passed out after he smelled what was in the 
bathtub.

Operas not just for Italians anymore
Composers utilize the nuances of their native languages to create dynamic pieces
Learning how to sing and act in different languages is a 
challenge for classical singers, as the languages that singers 
find themselves singing in are often very different from their 
native tongues. Languages share many of the properties of 
music, like rhythm and accents, and with time composers 
have become very skilled at conveying the meaning of words 
through music.
Much of the operatic repertory was contributed by Italian 
composers like Rossini, Verdi, and Puccini, who all wrote in 
their native tongue; several of Mozarts operas are in Italian 
as well. Italian was a natural language for opera because it is 
an even, flowing language in which each syllable is the same 
length. Italian also has many easily sung vowels. Spanish is 
similar; that's why it often seems like your Spanish teacher is 
talking at 20 miles an hour! This type of flowing language is 
very musical.
In the last century and a half, many nationalist composers 
began writing operas in their own languages, so less common 
languages became the norm. Czech composer Leos Janacek 
is a contemporary example of composers who are ignoring 
the traditions of language in music. According to BBC Music 
Magazine, Janacek's voice now had to be taken seriously, 
and he added something fundamentally new  the accents 
of the Czech language itself, which he transcribed into the 
music."
Languages such as English, Russian, and Czech lack the 
even, flowing characteristics of Italian. In Russian, each word 
has a single stress where one syllable in the word is stressed 
over all the other syllables; English has two levels of stress. 
Music has to reinforce languages natural rhythm, or it will
sound artificial. Modem composers have been experimenting 
lately, composing music that is antagonistic to language.
Another challenge in languages other than Italian is the 
varying word order. We are accustomed to one certain word 
order in English. In Russian and German, however, the word 
order is different. Remember how Yoda talked? For instance, 
if you translated a line of Russian word for word, it would read 
"smother I you in English. A singer does not want to sing like 
he is smothering himself, does he?
Opera is very different from liederart songs. A librettist 
takes a piece of literature and reworks it to be used in an op
era. For lieder, a composer takes a poem and puts it to music. 
Lieder have the added dimension of the elements of poetry, 
like meter and more complex grammar.
Obviously, it is very hard for non-native speakers to sound 
authentic when they are just speaking a language. Consider 
how much more difficult it would be to bellow out that really 
weird vowel over the top of the orchestra. Music majors at 
Carnegie Mellon are required to take semesters of French, 
Italian, and German language and diction. Diction could be 
described as the study of pronunciation. Opera companies 
often call in diction coaches to work with singers.
When singers are preparing a piece of music, they typically 
have a translation of the music so they know whats going on 
in at least a line or phrase of music, if not word by word. The 
beauty of music, though, is that you dont have to understand 
the words to understand their meaning. Samantha GrenellZaidman, a senior voice major, said, "The composer guides 
you with the music, so youre not completely lost. Composers
write the music to correspond not only to the language, but 
also to the emotion."
Some opera companies, like the Pittsburgh Opera, project 
translations of what the singer is saying during the perfor
mance. Many experienced opera-goers ignore the projections. 
Music is one of those rare art forms that allows us to under
stand a book without reading it. Nisha Asnani, a voice major, 
wrote, "The amazing thing about music is that you don't have 
to know the words at all to get the meaning, the feeling of the 
song. Music is a universal language."
Last Wednesday night, a group of Carnegie Mellon students 
went to a performance by the Moscow Chamber Orchestra 
with contralto Ewa Podles. The modem languages depart
ment sponsored the tickets, taking their cue from Charlene 
Castellano, a professor of Russian. Castellano wanted her 
students to experience the intersection between music and 
culture. She said, Some of my classes focus on language, oth
ers on culture. I see them as inseparable. The two need to be 
brought together in order to have a complete understanding."
Podles, a Polish singer, performed Rossinis Joan of Arc in Ital
ian and later Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death in Rus
sian. This programming is an excellent example of the versa
tility singers are expected to command. But, having read the 
song texts, one could sit back in his seat and let Mussorgskys 
imaginative music tell you what Podles was singing about.
^ Mussorgsky was very famous for his skill in setting words to 
music. His biographer, Gerald Abraham, wrote, As a musical 
translator of psychological states and even physical move
ment, he was unsurpassed."

Smart women dont need this book
David Bach tells women and old people how to get rich
Meet David Bach, financial advisor turned author. Bach has 
been pumping out books containing advice that everyday 
people can apply to their finances since 1999. He has written 
a generic manual, The Automatic Millionaire, in addition to 
several books targeting specific groups. Examples include 
Smart Couples Finish Rich; Start Late, Finish Rich (for an 
older audience); and the upcoming Start Early, Finish Rich, 
which might come in handy for life after graduation. But 
Bachs FinishRich series has one more part, targeting yet 
another societal niche: women.
Wait  what? Women arent exactly a subgroup of the 
population: theyre half of it. That is, unless you're in 
the world of David Bach, where women are just another 
marketing group. Bachs books give the impression that 
women are just another category of people, like married 
couples, the elderly, or high school and college graduates. '
In Smart Women Finish Rich, Bach provides financial advice 
that is tailored to fit a female audience. And apparently they 
needed the help, because Smart Women was Bach's first 
book, preceding even The Automatic MiEonate. But wait
 do women need their own book? Why isnt there a Smart 
Men Finish Rich? Your inner feminist  however small
 should be reeling.
Timing is a funny thing. Sunday was Carnegie Mellon's 10th 
annual MOSAIC conference, a vital campus event meant 
to survey the role of gender in the modem world. Mosaic 
also recognized the centennial of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College  its been a full hundred years since old 
Carnegie Tech first opened its doors to female students. A 
mere three days before all of this, on Thursday, the JosephBeth Booksellers store in South Side hosted one of Bachs 
trademarked FinishRich seminars.
Pittsburgh, what are you doing? How can you be the home
of such a progressive conference concerning gender issues, 
and yet embrace the teachings of David Bach? Can we really 
live in a city where MOSAIC 2006 and a seminar on Smart 
Women Finish Rich are allowed to occur simultaneously?
Skeptical, I paid a visit the South Side seminar. But who 
goes to these things? The audience was entirely female 
and diverse in age, and by a show of hands about half had 
already read Bachs book. A representative from Van Kampen 
Investments  the corporation that bought the rights to 
Smart Women  was leading the show. He navigated 
through a tedious PowerPoint as we took notes in our 
complimentary workbooks. On a table in the front of a room 
were about 50 .copies of Smart Women. Well, nobody ever had 
to write David Bach Finishes Rich... plenty of people already 
love his books.
Bach's methods include a nine-step plan, such as 
constructing a goal ladder, and catchy tips  one of these 
is finding your Latte Factor. He suggests that people waste 
something like $10 a day on things they dont really need. 
Miscellaneous expenses such as new clothes and dining out 
can gobble up considerable amounts of cash. The point is 
obvious, but it nevertheless succeeded in making me feel 
guilty for my pre-seminar stop at Caribou Coffee. And some 
of the topics in Smart Women are a little more complicated:
If you think W4 forms are complicated, try deciphering 
Bachs advice regarding ERA accounts and 401 (k) plans. By 
the time I left Joseph-Beth, I felt intimidated about finances 
and thankful for collegiate cushions such as DineX and 
CampusXpress.
Im pretty sure most people feel like that, though. Everybody 
feels overwhelmed on April 14, the day before tax day  men 
and women. So again I ask, why do we get our own book? 
Well, I learned from the seminar that there are some genderspecific financial issues that women would be unwise to 
ignore. The statistics are daunting: not only do females 
outlive males by an average of seven years, but the mean 
age of widowhood is only 56. Perhaps the most disburbing is 
that approximately one fourth of widowed women spend the 
death benefits of their departed spouses in two months. This 
is. due, in part, to the typical lack of adequate insurance in 
men and the regularity of debt before death. Additionally, on 
average, women sacrifice liy2 years of their careers to raise 
children.
And many women simply find it natural to let finances 
remain a male domain. I talked to Samantha Bushman, 
the committee chair of last years MOSAIC, and Rebecca 
Steinberg, a gender issues intern, who both agreed that it's 
common for married women to give their husbands complete 
control over the familys money. Surprisingly, this is true even 
for women who own their own businesses. The David Bach 
seminar also mentioned that married couples often defer to 
the 401 (k) plan of the male, even if that of the female will do 
more for their money.
Just the fact that reading the title Smart Women Finish Rich 
probably made you wince is what I would call a good sign. 
Bach's books are doing a service for previous generations 
of women, but as Bushman and Steinberg agreed, female 
financial independence is less of an issue for those of us now 
in college. Maybe the Burgh is big enough for MOSAIC 2006 
and David Bach... for now.

Dancing? You must be listening to Prefuse 73
Prefuse 73 rocks Rangos before conquering the world
"Someone call the CMU police, this girl is enjoying herself, 
she is dancing, please take her out of here... These were the 
sarcastic words of Gregg Gillis, known as Girl Talk, who 
opened for Prefuse 73 last Thursday night. This rebellious girl 
was one of many fans who came to see experimental beat 
artist Guillermo Scott Herren under the alias of Prefuse 73 (his 
other aliases include Savath and Savalas, Delarosa and Asora, 
and Piano Overlord). Prefuse 73 is currently touring with 
DJ/Knamiproko programmer Ryan Rasheed, who goes by the 
alias Leb Lase.
Rangos Ballroom was filled with Carnegie Mellon students 
and Pittsburgh locals who were standing around bobbing 
their heads and shaking their hips to the ingenious mixing 
and beats of Prefuse 73. Herren is popular for his unique glitch 
style, which appeals to both hip-hop and rock audiences.
As Peter Marshs February 26 article for the BBC said,
[he] turns lyrical flow into abstraction, into something like 
Kurt Schwitters sound poetry or a malfunctioning speech 
synthesizer. Rhymes'are reduced to a collection'of plosives, 
vowels, and half-formed syllables where the power of the 
original delivery is left intact, but the sense is all but removed; 
the rap becomes just another component of the music.
Matt Merewitz, a senior history major, said, It was good....
He is a sound artist, and what he is doing is basically sonic 
collages out of any given order, with hip-hop beats to root the 
crowd every once in a while. Although most of the crowd 
was standing in the typical arms-crossed, eyes-fixed-on-thestage-in-a-trance pose, there were many people who were 
moving to the beat. There was even some attempted break 
dancing.
Jamin Warren of Pitchfork Media wrote on February 21, On 
record, Prefuse 73 Sounds like a cyborg creation caught in a 
time trap somewhere between the hot buttered soul of the 
70s and the Mantronix-era vintage hip-hop of the mid-1980s."
Offstage, you probably wouldnt be able to tell him apart from 
the rest of the crowd. They just came out after the show, just 
like normal people, and stood around like everyone else, said 
Camly Tran, a first-year physics major.
In addition to his seemingly infinite amount of projects,
Herren has started the Eastern Development Music label, 
which he describes as being less concerned with being 
on some next shit, blowing the fuck up, or changing the 
face of anything ... [and] more concerned with bringing you 
music we think you'll feel and understand in the same way 
we do.
He is currently based in Barcelona working on several 
projects, including recording some songs for Spanish director 
Roger Gual, pre-mastering a full-length record he has recorded 
over the last year, and writing what he calls his most 
ambitious Savath y Savalas album ever. His next EP, Prefuse 
Reads the Books, is expected to come out in mid-July. He has 
a DJ tour in September with his brother, after which he plans 
to disappear for a while. Herrens description of his DJ tours 
seems extremely promising: When I DJ I play whatever the 
fuck I want, and I want to see people slow dancing like its a 
prom, and everyone should learn to salsa before they come out 
too. The tour will definitely provide an amazing show for all of 
those rebellious fans who like to enjoy themselves.

Wiz Khalifas ego soldiers on
Local rappers inflated ego is little help to Pittsburghs music scene
Pittsburgh needs a music scene. Not just a "music scene" 
in the sense that touring bands grace Pittsburgh with their 
honorary presence, but also a music scene in the sense that 
the city can become a breeding ground for up-and-coming 
artists. Although the city is overflowing with creativity and 
talent, few artists become successful outside of the city limits
 if they even make it that far.
Enter Wiz Khalifa, the citys answer to the lack of native 
artists. Khalifa, whose real name is Cameron Thomaz, is a 
Pittsburgh high-school MC signed to Rostrum Records. He 
has a mixtape, entitled Welcome to Pistolvania, that is gaining 
recognition from local newspapers and radio stations.
A mixtape differs from a traditional record because it is much 
more focused on the rapping than on the music. It is meant to 
create buzz about a certain rapper before his or her legitimate 
CD is released. Less money, advertising, and general publicity 
are devoted to a mixtape, because record executives expect 
word of mouth to be the most powerful initial distributor.
Once the mixtape has been well-hyped and distributed, the 
record labels release a bigger and better CD.
So, when Khalifas mixtape landed in my hands late last week, 
I had high expectations for the young rapper. I expected 
infectious flow, supportive-yet-simple beats, and, most 
importantly, intelligent, educated rhymes.
I got very little of what I expected. The beats were dark and 
heavy, with the stereotypical rap/gangster/street attitude.
The rapping itself was no different. I thought, A high school 
senior rapping about how good he is and the rough life on the 
streets? Am I the only one whos confused here?
[The streets] dont want to hear commercial, poppy stuff," 
said Benjy Grinberg, who signed Khalifa, in an interview with 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette earlier this month. They want 
to hear what you have to say. Fair enough, I thought. But
unfortunately, Khalifa has very few interesting things to say.
In Me, Khalifa wastes 4:13 of his audience's valuable time 
glorifying himself  a high school senior  and his Godgiven talent: Who is on the grind?/ Me/ Winnin' all the time/ 
Me/ 'Bout them dolla signs/ Me.
Sorry Wiz, Kanye's akeady got enough ego for the music 
world... and at least he deserves to brag. In the opening track, 
Oh No, Wiz raps over a hackneyed beat of digital claps and 
synthesized strings about, yep, his glory: "Yeah, you hot in 
your hood, Im burning towns down ... Wiz Khalifa got that 
fast to that slow flow/ Cash-gettin mojo ... play it back they 
like,oh no.
I mentioned that Kanye deserves to brag. Even though Kanye 
himself doesnt have many interesting things to say, he makes 
up for it with fabulous music behind his raps. Who else can 
sample blues legend Ray Charles, jazz icon Lester Young, and 
pop singer Adam Levine of Maroon 5 all on the same record, 
and make catchy and danceable beats? Khalifa and his DJ, DJ 
Huggy, have done the opposite. They assembled 20 tracks of 
stale rhymes and unoriginal beats that make me remember 
why I used to hate rap so much. Regardless of how important 
the music is in the mixtape, its important for the beats to 
encourage originality and substance in the rapping.
One track out of the 20 just barely caught my attention.
In "Soldier," Khalifa shows off his true strength  his flow
 when he raps over the catchy bass-line-driven beat. With 
a touch of keyboards and strings, the beat brings back the 
brilliant simplicity that Dr. Dres legendary Chronic 2001 
record once coined. The hook, sung by Gene Stovall, adds just 
what the rest of Khalifas music lacks: a catchy, soulful chorus 
that the mainstream audiences can grab onto. However, if you 
actually listen to the words, youll realize that this really isnt 
a great hook: "Im a soldier/ Wiz been the best/ brush your 
shoulders... But, when Khalifa opens his best song with, I
will never sell myself short, Im too cocky ... I think dudes is 
mad 'cause you not me/ So you get a pen and a pad and you 
copy!" thats about as good a hook as hell get.
If Wiz Khalifa gets over his ego and realizes that his flow is 
just about the only thing going for him right now, he may still 
have the potential to become a respected rapper. The music 
industry has enough larger-than-life rappers (like Ludacris) to 
look at Khalifa and toss his mixtape in the trash. If he channels 
his talent more carefully and puts himself in-the position to 
say something respectable (lets face it, Mr. Khalifas rap skills 
are not the most pressing issues in America today), he may 
be able to become the Immortal Technique or Common of the 
future. And hey, he just might be able to carry Pittsburgh back 
to the top of the nation's music scene... where it deserves to 
be.
Wiz Khalifa has a show March 3 at 10 pm at New Evolution 
Studios, and March 5 at 8 pm at Mr. Smalls with Ghostface 
and The Govament.

What the Beaux Arts Ball represents, then, is an intense and 
successful collaboration between all parts of the College of 
Fine Arts. Every kind of person, young and old, from every 
department of the college contributed to the execution of this 
festivity. Faculty contributed heavily to the partys planning, 
but in many cases, the ball is a culmination of student work.
For instance, this is the first time that students designed the 
balls invitation. Assistant professor of design Kristin Hughes
Beaux Arts Ball returns
should be," said Cooper. The planning is stronger and more 
efficient when it is student-run. Students have more natural 
energy.
Over two dozen CFA faculty members representing each 
school in the college helped organize the event. They selected 
a broad representation of students from the college to help 
them deliberate and make decisions. The students in advisory 
positions were chosen based on reputation in their school. The 
faculty and staff members wanted advice from students who 
could get opinions from their peers and speak for them. Siders 
identified this as a sort of grassroots group of student advisors.
We made a constant effort for this to be a student event, said 
Anne Witchner, assistant dean of Student Affairs. Although 
spearheaded by faculty, the planning committees aimed for a 
party that would make the most students happy.
Witchner said that the faculty and staff work mostly behind 
the scenes for an event like this, but she also stressed the 
importance of regulation and oversight. She said that the ball 
of 1985 and the few balls following that did not incorporate 
administrative input. While believing that student input is 
paramount, Witchner sees this oversight as necessary and 
thinks that previous balls suffered from lack of it.
Despite this emphasis on oversight, the administration has 
worked well with the students. Nikki Delhomme, a senior 
costume design major, said she was pleased with the way the 
planning was working out.
Its very relaxed. [The administration officials] arent 
cramming answers down our throat, and we still get a lot 
done, she said.
A team effort
Hiatus ends in celebration of the CFA centennial
by Matthew McKee | Staffwriter
In this centennial year of Carnegie Mellons College of Fine 
Arts, the school has geared up for a celebration of its legacy 
and future. Its wide-reaching network of faculty, alumni, and 
students has touched the arts nationwide, and to celebrate, 
its bringing back one of its grandest traditions.
Get ready for the heralded return of the Beaux Arts Ball. 
After a decade of absence, the huge costume party will hit 
the university scene once more this Saturday. Trust me; you 
have not seen anything like it.
A brief history
CFA faculty and students have prepared for this event since 
the fall of 2005. They know they have a legacy to live up to, 
since the tradition began at Carnegie Mellon in 1912 under 
dean Henry Hornbostel.
"It has this Old World grand tradition, said Jim Siders, 
masters student in music performance. It's a great chance 
to throw a thing like this with its background."
Over the years, it has recurred in fits and starts," said Doug 
Cooper, the Andrew Mellon professor of architecture. It's 
really a wonderful, central experience  an essential thing 
in the life of the college."
Many alumni and faculty fondly remember past balls,
and former CFA students have already begun buying 
tickets for the event. The gala of magical performances 
and magnificent costumes left an imprint on the minds of 
so many that the college simply could not call this year a 
centennial without bringing it back.
So what caused the ball to disappear for 11 years? In 1985, 
the Beaux Arts Ball turned into a chaotic and hedonistic 
free-for-all as the party got way out of hand. Students just 
went wild, and many recall beer flowing down steps and 
through floors into staff offices. It cost the CFA thousands 
in damage and scarred the balls already controversial 
reputation.
Some students attempted to revive the event with mixed 
success after that, and the last relatively successful attempt 
occurred in 1995. Since then, the Beaux Arts Ball has faded 
from student recollection.
Students and faculty make their plans
This year, planning committees had to work with a student 
body lacking any collective memory of the ball. Faculty and 
staff led the massive undertaking, and students had to build 
from scratch.
We developed a top-down planning approach with less 
student involvement than in the past, but this is not how it

led the marketing side of the ball by encouraging willing 
students to apply what they learned to making tangible 
results. The techniques of using inks and papers to address 
the balls theme "Light and Shadow inspired a vibrant 
invitation that plays with light in interesting ways.
"Its nice to advise students when they can design something 
that actually gets produced and printed, said Hughes. She 
believes that its good for students to express their voice 
and see the impact it has on the intended audience. The 
invitations were sent to alumni, CFA students, and other 
related individuals at the beginning of January.
This kind of circumstance that brings together different 
disciplines is becoming harder to find, said Cooper.
The event itself will also present a celebration of what CFA 
students have to offer. Rock bands of alumni and students 
will perform in the Alumni Concert Hall as a WRCT DJ fills 
the main CFA hall with tunes. In the backstage of Kresge 
Auditorium, the "Kresge Club will feature students from the 
School of Music performing more intimate pieces in a cabaret 
setting.
This does not even begin to address the decorations that will 
adorn the college on the night of the ball. These decorations 
will take almost a whole day to set up. Entire classes have 
accepted the task to make the event stand up to its past with 
an extravagantly constructed atmosphere. Technical aspects 
of the decorations had to be thought over and rolled out in 
these classes. Again, the creativity will see tangible results.
Every public space in the building will be theatrically fit, said 
Siders.
The theme of "Light and Shadow prompted students to use 
only fighting effects in the decorations. This invited design 
and architectural students to work together and combine 
principles, for lights incorporate more possibilities than, say, 
streamers and balloons. Cooper pointed out that the CFA 
building has such interesting features to highlight in setting 
up the ambience. Taking advantage of all that the building has 
to offer means a wonderful surrounding to a party.
We wanted to build a sense of what was illusion and what 
was real, said Delhomme.
"It's very much a team effort from all the departments of CFA, 
said Siders.
Lets party!
Ultimately, these well-laid plans will all result in a fun-filled 
evening of merrymaking. Costume prizes and other surprises 
will keep the ball interesting until it lets up at 2 am on Sunday 
morning. In addition to the above events, the Zebra Lounge will 
be transformed into an oxygen bar. The Kresge stage will host 
silent films and performances afterwards.
The individuals at the party have the potential to bring some 
outrageous costumes to the scene. Delhomme hopes to see some 
risk-taking in costumes, mentioning one instance in the past 
where a student had a chess piece costume.
This is one chance to dress up and be extravagant, she said.
The safety issues of drinking alcohol in a packed building have 
been intensely deliberated in the planning committees with the 
help of many students, and they believe that their decisions will 
benefit the most people. Strict regulations will keep the ball in 
check, and Siders has helped coordinate the party with University 
Police, Emergency Medical Services, and the fire marshal.
You cant throw an animal house party and expect to get 
away with it in an institution like this, said Siders. Its kind of 
expected that theres a certain level of control.... I actually think 
that total lawlessness, not strict regulations, will drive people 
away. People want to go to an event that's fun but safe.
Now, the only thing left to do is get the word out. Witchner and 
Cooper emphasized that CFA has not kept the event all to itself. 
All students can purchase a ticket to the party extravaganza.
Its hard to have an event that no one's heard of, said Witchner. 
Hopefully people will take advantage of this unique event.
If everything goes well, this huge celebration of the College of 
Fine Arts will reinstate the great memories of the Beaux Arts 
Ball so that it can happen again. Siders believes that he and his 
colleagues have truly laid the groundwork for the future.
The last day, to buy tickets is Tuesday. Tickets for the Ball are 
available at the School of Drama box office, which is open . 
weekdays from noon to 5 pm. For more information, call the box 
office at 412.268.2407.

Cows + chocolate ? healthy Pa.
Pa. agriculture still provides more vitamins than healthy chocolate
Anyone driving east toward Philadelphia knows that, 
anything, there are abundances of cows, trees, trees, cows, 
cows, and more cows in Pennsylvania. And of course, when 
there are cows, theres milk, and when theres milk, there's 
chocolate. Although Pennsylvania is known for steel mills, 
Heinz ketchup, the Steelers, and cows, were also known for 
chocolate. Centered in Hershey, Pa., is everyones favorite 
serotonin booster: Hersheys chocolate.
But Pennsylvanias affinity towards chocolate doesnt end 
here. On February 13, 2003, a bill was passed designating 
the chocolate chip cookie as the official cookie of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Due to Pennsylvania's 
leading role in the national production of processed chocolate 
and cocoa, as well as the popularity of chocolate chip cookies 
among the children and adults of the Commonwealth, it was 
deemed necessary to award this title to a beloved favorite in 
America.
The question then becomes whether or not we are a nation 
suffering from an acute case of chocoholicism. Perhaps 
we are  especially with the recent emergence of a slew 
of studies concerning the theoretical health benefits of 
chocolate. Are we trying to justify our chocolate craze 
by rationalizing with the positive health implications of 
chocolate? Maybe chocolate actually possesses health 
promoting qualities. Mars, Inc., the maker of M&Ms, Snickers, 
and Milky Way, certainly believes so.
With a new product line called CocoaVia planned for release 
nationwide, Mars, Inc. claims that their products are high 
in antioxidants, which may have possible blood-pressurelowering effects similar to those of aspirin. Furthermore, since 
they have been enhanced with vitamins and cholesterollowering plant sterols, the company is confident that their line 
of products made with dark chocolate will fit in a healthy diet.
This insight into dark chocolate has caused other chocolatiers 
to jump on the bandwagon as well. Hershey Co. is planning 
on adding new dark chocolate products to their already wide 
range of chocolate offerings.
Is this new perspective on chocolate something to be 
concerned about? Yes. In a nation where "chocoholics 
anonymous is a phrase that is jokingly thrown around in 
conversations and nearly every holiday or special occasion 
revolves around giving or receiving chocolate, we should 
be concerned with how people will react to information that 
promotes chocolate as a "health food.
In a nation where chocolate-covered anything (ranging 
from strawberries to gummy bears to mealworms) is sold, 
we should be very afraid of mobs of people swarming to the 
nearest chocolate store once they find out about "healthy 
chocolate.
In a nation where hot chocolate is the choice drink of the 
winter and chocolate milk is drunk all year round, we should
be worried about consumers giving up wholesome beverages 
like orange juice and milk for chocolate beverages.
In a nation where obesity is a leading health problem, we 
should not be encouraging the consumption of chocolate as a 
snack whose ability to reduce the risk of cancer and/or heart 
disease has not been clearly established.
Simply put, although consuming dark chocolate in moderation 
may, in fact, provide the body with a good source of 
antioxidants, the merits of consuming fruits and vegetables 
should not be dismissed. If you need an excuse to eat 
chocolate, don't say that it is for your health. Be honest with 
yourself and admit that you are eating chocolate because you 
enjoy indulging in this delectable sweet treat.
Next time you pick up a Kit Kat bar or some Hershey Kisses, 
dont say that youre eating it for the fiavanols. Dont act like 
you dont enjoy eating chocolate, because not only are you 
lying to yourself, youre being disrespectful to chocolate... 
and we all know that disrespecting chocolate is not allowed. 
Especially if youre living in Pennsylvania, where there is an 
abundance of cows.

Video may have killed the radio star, but I blame you for Nick and 
Jessicas breakup. And Ill never, ever forgive you.
Over spring break, you will be asked to leave the opera house when you 
interrupt the climax of La Traviata with a belting rendition of Come What 
May" from Moulin Rouge.
This week, you will sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock in a 
pestilential prison with a life-long lock, awaiting the sensation of a short, 
sharp, shock from a cheap and chippy chopper on a big, black block. 
Arent you just so proud?
All your romantic conceptions of true love will be shattered when you 
realize that if Aida and Radames had just shut up and stopped singing, 
they would have had enough air in that sealed chamber to do it one 
last time. v
The conductor will not appreciate your attempt to beat-box behind 
Beethovens 9th. Sit down and shut up.
Tonight, your voice major friend will divulge to you her hot secret: she 
can hit a high D, but only in bed. Youll ask her why she does vocal 
exercises in bed rather than in a practice room. Shell look at you 
quizzically.
This week, you will chew on a pen till it explodes in your mouth. But its 
invisible ink, so... no worries.
While your classmates are getting tipsy and starring in Girls Gone Wild 
DVDs over spring break, you will be the unwitting co-star of a Bob Villa, 
do-it-yourself kitchen cabinet refurbishing video. Your father will be 
mortified and never show his face in Sears ever again.
You will try to compete with the popular Lunar Gala by starting your 
own fashion show: The Solar Gala. Too bad the sun never shines on 
Pittsburgh. Ever.
Scientists hypothesize that billions of years ago, a planet comparable 
to Earths size crashed into it. Earth cracked open like a fallen souffl 
and drowned in molten rock. Our planet was completely inhospitable 
for millions of years. Your week will be sort of like that.
You will try to follow in the successful footsteps of barbeque-chicken 
pizza with mayonnaise-pickle pizza. You will fail.
Youre 21 years old this week! Too bad that wont help you get out of 
your indentured servitude with those pirates. The contract was until 
your 21st birthday, and you were born on February 29th. Enjoy the 
next 63 years, me hardy, and say hello to the very model of a modern 
major general for me.
