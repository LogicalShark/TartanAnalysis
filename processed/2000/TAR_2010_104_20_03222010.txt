Chickens found on campus; police investigate foul play
PATRICK GAGE KELLEY
Contributing Editor
Over the past week, nine 
chickens were found across 
campus. The chickens were 
found alone, some deposited 
in paper bags, malnourished, 
and apparently painted. Carn
egie Mellon University Police 
arranged for the chickens to 
be transported to the Wildbird 
Recovery sanctuary north of 
the city.
Stanley Krowitz, the Uni
versity Centers evening busi
ness manager, described the 
first bird sighting as quite 
a spectacle. Between Wean 
and Kirr Commons in the UC, 
there was a reddish rooster 
... with families and kids 
around saying Oh, look at the 
cute chicken.  With the help 
of others in the UC, Krowitz 
was able to temporarily 
hold the chicken, and 
one other bird found 
in the racquetball 
courts, in standardissue Carnegie Mellon card
board recycling receptacles.
Beth McMaster, who owns 
the Wildbird Recovery center 
where the birds are staying, 
has been forthcoming with 
police and the local media, 
asking for those who did this 
.to be prosecuted. While initial 
local news reports seemed to 
indicate that Carnegie Mellon 
would be handling this situ
ation entirely internally, The 
Tartan has been told that is 
not the case.
Michael Murphy, vice pres
ident for Campus Affairs and 
interim dean of Student Af
fairs, spoke with The Tartan by 
phone Friday. He stated that 
after the internal process was 
completed the administration 
would then engage the right 
outside agency, adding, If it 
does need to result in some 
formal external notification, 
it will be done.
Murphy wanted to ac
knowledge that although 
this is an incident that 
many people are very 
interested in, the uni
versitys policy is to 
not discuss the 
details of the
situation until we have com
pleted the investigation and 
decided what judicial action 
is warranted.
A number of student 
groups, the Office of Student 
Life, and University Police de
clined comment, as the inves
tigation is currently ongoing.
Murphy said that this is not 
the last we will hear about the 
chickens. I think this will all 
come out, speaking about the 
situation with the chickens, 
he said. We will be fully dis
closing, ultimately, when we 
do know all the facts.
This disclosure is what 
some like McMaster are look
ing for, regardless of the effect 
it may have on some students 
lives if they are criminally 
prosecuted, The Western 
Pennsylvania Humane Soci
ety told TribLive that the stu
dents involved could face up 
to $750 in fines and 90 days in 
jail for animal cruelty.
Krowitz favors a thoughtful 
approach taken if students are 
involved, There are things 
you dont allow, but you dont 
just crucify them..., he said. 
You need to understand the 
root of the problem. And 
certainly he wishes to under
stand how these hens ended 
up in the University Center on 
his watch, telling The Tartan, 
That was the craziest Satur
day I have had in 10 years.
If anyone has any informa
tion about the chickens, they 
should contact University Po
lice. As .details continue to be 
uncovered, check thetartan.

Students entering Marga

declaring the presence of as

Asbestos is a naturally oc
curring fiber that can be wo

most chemicals. For these rea
sons, in the mid-20th century, 
asbestos was considered ideal 
for use in construction-related 
applications, including roof
ing shingles, ceiling and floor 
tiles, paper and cement prod
ucts, textiles, and coatings. 
However, the inhalation of 
asbestos fibers can cause seri
ous illnesses, including lung 
cancer and asbestosis, a type 
of lung ailment. Since Jan. 1, 
2005, the European Union has 
banned all use of asbestos as 
well as banning all extraction, 
manufacture, and processing 
of asbestos products.

Eight students spend spring break in Qatar with IMPAQT program
SABRINA PORTER
Contributing Editor
Eight Carnegie Mellon 
students experienced life on 
our Qatar sister campus this 
spring break. The students 
traveled to the Carnegie Mel
lon campus in Doha, Qatar 
to spend their time immers
ing themselves in its culture, 
acquainting themselves with 
the student body there, and 
developing ways to bridge the 
gap between the Qatar and 
Pittsburgh campuses.
It definitely was the best 
trip Ive ever experienced, 
said Tarik Raed, a junior busi
ness administration major
and one of this years partici
pants.
The trip is part of the 
Carnegie Mellon Initiating 
Meaningful Pittsburgh and 
Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) pro
gram, sponsored by the Qatar 
Foundation and the Division 
of Student Affairs at Carnegie 
Mellon in Pittsburgh. The Qa
tar Foundation is a privately 
chartered nonprofit organiza
tion founded in Qatar in 1995 
by Emir Sheikh Hamad bin 
Khalifa A1 Thani. The founda
tion funds education, science, 
and community development 
initiatives, and was the en
abling force behind the for
mation of Education City, the
collection of Qatar campuses 
of which Carnegie Mellon is 
a part.
Founded in fall 2008, the 
IMPAQT program sends eight 
students to the campus each 
spring break to strengthen 
the Pittsburgh campus rela
tionship with the Qatar com
munity. Throughout the trip, 
the students learn all they can 
and bring it back to Pittsburgh 
in the form of cross-campus 
collaboration projects.

CMU boasts Bush historian, fiber project
Google Fiber in Pittsburgh Skinner joins history project
This Friday is the deadline 
for city and county govern
ments to express interest and 
submit proposals for the new 
Google high-speed network. 
This innovative experimen
tal fiber-optic network can 
achieve speeds of up to 100 
times current cable, DSL, and 
fiber-optic networks with a 
delivery speed of one gigabit 
per second.
According to Carnegie 
Mellon University president 
Jared Cohon and Pittsburgh 
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, the 
cities must show that they 
have the interest and resourc
es to support Googles proj
ect, and the website www. 
pi ttsburghgoesgoogle. com. 
The competition to attract 
Googles attention is wide 
ranging, spanning 80 cities
and 200 Facebook groups, as ' 
individuals and companies 
alike try to gain the network 
that could almost instanta
neously download any book 
in the Library of Congress, 
according to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette.
Google, which plans to 
select winners by the end 
of the year, announced the 
Google Fiber for Communi
ties Program on Feb. 10, and 
will charge competitive rates 
to a demographic spanning 
50,000 to 500,000 people, all 
while paying for the costs of 
installation and operation of 
the network.
Citizens, businesses, and 
universities are encouraged 
to visit the website and show 
their support for the city of 
Pittsburgh.
Kiron K. Skinner, an asso
ciate professor in the depart
ment of social and decision 
sciences in H&SS, was ap

for the George W. Bush Oral 
History Project as one of two 
historians. Skinner is also the 
director of the International 
Relations and Politics Pro
gram and has served on the 
National Security Education 
Board, on the U.S. Defense 
Departments Defense Policy 
Board as an Iraq and Afghani
stan war advisor, and on the 
National Academies Commit
tee on Behavioral and SocialScience Research to Improve 
Intelligence Analysis for Na
tional Security.
The Oral History Project 
aims to study the life of Bush, 
the 43rd President, especially
through the White House 
years, as an oral history for 
the Miller Center of Public 
Affairs in the University of 
Virginia. The Miller Center 
is the only one in the country 
that documents the lives of 
former presidents. In addi
tion to Skinner, members of 
the Advisory Board include 
Karl Rove and Mark Langdale 
(president of the George W. 
Bush Presidential Library 
Foundation).
Skinner co-authored The 
Strategy of Campaigning: Les
sons from Ronald Reagan and 
Boris Yeltsin and authored 
Turning Points in Ending the 
Cold War, as well as five other 
works.

March 22, 2010  The Tartanthetartan.org/news  A3
Initiative will bring 
educational options 
to Rwandan children
LAPTOPS, from A1 projects, class discussions,
called the XO-1.
Previously known as the 
$100 laptop, the comput
ers are rugged, low-cost, 
low power, and pre-installed 
with software designed to 
foster collaborative, self
empowered learning. OLPC 
will assign the group of Car
negie Mellon students to an 
elementary school in the 
Rwandan capital where the 
students have already been 
given laptops.
The project team was 
formed due to the efforts of 
senior business administra
tion major Sasha Urquidi and 
junior electrical and comput
er engineering major Rohith 
Salim through their work for 
Students In Free Enterprise 
(SIFE).
The two upperclassmen 
connected with the other 
four students to initiate a 
dialogue concerning the cre
ation of a service project in 
Rwanda, eventually creating 
an interdisciplinary project 
that hopes to make education 
for Rwandan children more 
than just a luxury.
The project has received a 
positive reaction from many 
students. Rwanda is in dire 
need of innovative education
al policy, said Aderinsola Akintilo, a first-year information 
systems major from Nigeria. 
Many children will not even 
have access to books, so if the 
program can teach children 
how to use computers, then I 
think it is fantastic.
For us, inspiration and 
empowerment are key, ex
plained Badiani, who is heav
ily involved in the initiative.
We would like to unleash 
the creativity and spark we 
know these children have, 
whether that be through art
presentations, or team build
ing and leadership work
shops.
The group of four will be 
joined by six students from 
Carnegie Mellons campus in 
Qatar for the summit in Ki
gali.
Badiani emphasized that 
one of the projects goals was 
to strengthen ties between 
both campuses.
The group also welcomed 
other passionate students to 
join the team for their trip to 
Kigali.
Students who were in
terested in the project were 
encouraged to complete an 
application process that in
volved an interview.
The project has room for 
two more students and de
cisions will be sent out on 
Wednesday.
While we have developed 
this project, we would like for 
our new selected team mem
bers to contribute to, further 
develop, and help refine it, so 
we are definitely still open to 
fresh ideas, said Solomon, 
speaking about her excite
ment at the prospect of add
ing to the group.
One of the long-term goals 
of the project is sustainability. 
The team has often stressed 
their desire to be able to con
tribute beyond just the sum
mit.
We are trying to make the 
project sustainable by keep
ing contact with the students 
in Rwanda through video 
conferences and letter writ
ing. This way, you dont have 
to go on the trip; you can act 
locally, Chintakunta said

local community.
While there, we took 
part in QALTA, which can be 
equated to CMU-Pittsburghs 
Summit, except it takes place 
after spring break, said Eda 
Akyar, a junior Science and 
Humanities Scholar and one 
of the programs participants. 
Some activities included Mid
dle Eastern cooking, dancing, 
games, fashion, instruments, 
calligraphy, and henna.
Bahati Mutisya, a junior 
business major and one of this 
years participants, is a danc
ing enthusiast and especially 
enjoyed the dance lessons, 
which included bhangra, belly 
dancing, and dabke dancing. 
She also took a lot from the 
sessions held.
During the QALTA class 
called Breaking Stereotypes,
we talked about the miscon
ceptions of the Middle East 
and the Western world, Muti
sya said. We also learned 
the differences between their 
religion and their culture dur
ing the Islamic Feminism ses
sion.
In terms of their most 
memorable moments in Qa
tar, Raed, Mutisya, and Ak
yar all agreed that this was in 
their time spent with the Qa
tar students.
One of my favorite mo
ments was the first night, 
Raed said. The eight of us 
were sitting at a long table 
with 15 Qatari students, and 
we were all just firing ques
tions at each other about ev
erything in our cultures.
Raed, Akyar, and Mutisya 
all said that the Qatar students 
were one of the most hospita
ble groups of people they had
ever met. Raed added that 
their English was practically 
flawless.
While in Doha, the students 
were also able to explore the 
city outside of the campus. 
We had the opportunity to do 
some fun activities off campus 
such as sand-duning, or sandbashing as the students in 
Qatar call it; tour Al-Jazeera; 
walk around in the souk; visit 
Fanar, which is the Islamic 
Cultural Center; tour the AS
PIRE sports complex; and visit 
the Islamic art museum, Ak
yar said.
The last night of the pro
gram, the students spent the 
night with families of the Qa
tar students. The women in 
the group experienced a home 
stay while the men spent a 
night out in the desert.
Despite cultural differenc
es, Raed spoke of the similari
ties he experienced with the 
students.Theyre just like us, 
he said. In terms of what is on 
their iPods, what movies they 
watch, and what music they 
listen to, it was shocking to me 
just how similar we are.
The students were able to 
interact with 14 Qatar stu
dents who visited the Pitts
burgh campus the week before 
spring break to experience 
American culture and interact 
with the students in a similar 
way to the IMPAQT program, 
and the groups were able to 
share their experiences.
Past participants are in con
stant collaboration, as they all 
work on forming their own 
projects that help unite the 
campuses. Last years projects 
included an orientation event 
at The Frame to show incom
ing Pittsburgh students part of 
the culture of Qatar, a photo 
installation in Morewood 
showing images of Carnegie 
Mellons Qatar campus, and a 
seminar and lunch discussion 
for Ph.D. students considering 
research in Qatar.
Students participating in 
IMPAQT consistently mention 
the lessons they learned from 
traveling to Qatar, as well as 
creating projects with their 
fellow students.
I could not have learned 
what I learned in a classroom 
or from a book. It was an eyeopening experience, Mutisya 
said.
Applications for the 2011 
IMPAQT program will be 
available in the fall.

dents who spend most of their 
time inside the building. 
However, Banister also 
stresses that asbestos, when 
properly handled, does not 
pose any health risk. This is es
pecially true in Margaret Mor
rison, where asbestos is only 
present in the back side of the 
plaster and is not exposed un
less the material is damaged. 
According to Banister, health 
risks are also low during the 
current repairs due to the 
steps taken by the health de
partment. County personnel 
inspect the completed work
before the barriers are re
moved and also review the air 
test results to ensure safe re
occupancy of the area, Banister\said. The barriers that one 
sees from the outside are de
signed to prevent any asbestos 
fibers from leaving the work 
area. Filtered vacuum units 
run within the work area to 
also ensure that no contami
nation leaves the area.
Students enrolled in 
classes taking place in Mar
garet Morrison have not had 
to change their routes sig
nificantly thanks to a second 
stairway only a few feet away. 
However, many students have 
voiced complaints concerning 
the quality of the repair ef- , 
forts. I was surprised to see 
that the areas of the walls that 
had been repaired didnt look 
nice at all. The color doesnt 
match the rest of the walls, 
and in some places the drywall hasnt been replaced, 
said Sarah Read, a first-year 
design major.
In addition to Margaret 
Morrison, two other Carn
egie Mellon buildings contain 
materials contaminated with 
asbestos. In the boiler room 
of Morewood Gardens, the 
ceiling contains asbestos, and 
on the fourth floor of Hunt 
Library, there is asbestos fireproofing above the suspended 
ceiling in the center above and 
around the rare book room. 
No one is permitted to lift the 
ceiling tiles in this area.
While the presence of asCelia Ludwinski/Photo Editor
In Margaret Morrison, repairs to water damaged stairwells were delayed 
due to plaster that was contaminated with asbestos.
bestos may make some stu
dents nervous, EHS and FMS

negie Mellons campus and 
buildings safe for students 
and faculty. According to Ban
ister, the departments detec
tion measures, as well as their 
commitment to repairing any 
risky areas, will keep campus
free of asbestos-related health 
risks.
We maintain an inven
tory of all asbestos locations 
on campus and monitor them 
routinely for damage or dete
rioration. Whenever such con
ditions occur, we take prompt 
action to repair or remove the 
material in question.
Cohon addresses undergraduate Senators questions

sure you feel supported and 
that you know how to get 
help when you need it. And 
that you do get help when 
you need it.
Cohon then opened the 
floor to questions from the 
Senators, beginning with a 
question about Carnegie Mel
lons transfer student commu
nity. We make it very hard 
for students to transfer here, 
Cohon said in response to a 
question on why the trans
fer class at Carnegie Mellon 
was so small. We have to get 
each department to accept 
transfers, and maybe because 
of our unusual programs, its 
very hard to get them to ac
cept them. But there is room 
for more transfer students 
here.
One question in particu
lar  about how the recent 
deaths in the campus com
munity have affected the out
side perception of Carnegie 
Mellon  seemed to rattle 
Cohon. Speaking haltingly, 
Cohon said, The two deaths 
were terrible and should not 
have happened. We as an ad
ministration have learned as 
much as we can from them to 
try and avoid that happening 
again. With regards to public 
perception, it is a problem. 
These things matter. But I 
dont think people think that 
way about Carnegie Mellon. I 
think they see stories like that 
as atypical.
However, Cohons speech 
ended on a positive note. 
Were very proud of our 
student body here, he said. 
Theyre a talented, brilliant, 
determined bunch.
Speaking after the event, 
students had mixed reactions 
concerning the question and 
answer session.
Stephanie Schneider, a 
sophomore Senator repre
senting the Tepper School of 
Business, said, I think it was 
more about bringing things to 
his attention, but I dont know 
that this was a perfect venue 
to go into detail about any of 
these things. But as Student 
Senators, we just want to get 
the ideas out there.
Alex Blair, a junior Sena
tor representing the Science 
and Humanities Scholars pro
gram, pressed Cohon on Car
negie Mellons units system, 
and summarized his question 
after the event.
The discrepancy is be
tween the number of units 
and the number of hours that 
the student actually has to 
spend working, he said. I 
think you could reduce the 
workload and still maintain 
rigor.
However, in response to 
Blairs concern, Cohon said, 
Life at Carnegie Mellon will 
never be perfect, and if the 
first thing that comes to mind 
is working harder, for more 
hours than youre getting 
credit for, thats both fixable 
and not too terrible.
This isnt the place to get 
solutions, Blair said. I think 
thats why he threw it back at 
me.
Sometimes its hard to ask 
the person on top about stuff 
because he doesnt always 
know the details of things, 
said Thomas Tuttle, a junior 
Senator from the School of 
Computer Science. But I 
think it was fine.
Tuttle was more enthusias
tic when speaking about the 
event in general. I think it
- was really nice that [Cohon] 
came here and just talked to 
students. Hes a lot more ap
proachable than most people 
in his position.

Skinput transforms arm into touchpad
ABHAY BUCH
Staffwriter
As electronic devices get 
smaller and smaller, the but
tons, touch screens, and knobs 
we use to control them must 
do the same. A need for us
ability constrains the size of 
devices and is often the only 
thing that keeps devices from 
getting smaller and more con
venient to carry.
Chris Harrison, a third- # 
year Ph.D. student at the Hu
man Computer Interaction 
Institute, has found a way to 
move the method of input out
side the device, removing this 
inconvenient constraint.
His product, Skinput, 
developed in conjunction 
with Microsoft researchers 
Dan Morris and Desney Chan, 
seeks to allow people to inter
act with their electronics sim
ply by touching different parts 
of their forearms. It effectively 
transforms an arm into a 
touchscreen or touchpad.
According to a Carnegie 
Mellon press release, bone 
and soft tissue variations in 
the arm mean that tapping 
one part of the arm produces 
different sounds and vibra
tions than tapping some other 
part.
These vibrations then trav
el up the arm, where sensors 
can determine the frequency. 
Since each location has a dis
tinctive frequency, the sensors 
can determine which part of 
the arm was tapped. Harrison 
said that the sensors are de
vices known as piezoelectric 
crystals, which produce an

Current development allows an interface to be projected on a Skinput users arm. Tapping certain places on 
the arm creates different vibrational frequencies, which are detected by sensors that accurately determine the 
location of the tapping. Skinput also works by tapping on the wrist, fingers, and palm.
electric current in response 
to vibration, and an array of 
10 such sensors placed in an 
armband are used to detect 
the vibrations. Each crystal is 
tuned to detect a particular 
characteristic frequency.
The signals generated by 
the sensors are then passed 
through a set of machine 
learning algorithms that improve the accuracy of the 
sensors and give the location 
of tapping with greater cer
tainty. Despite the fact that 
human arms are quite differ
ent from person to person, 
Harrison said that his system 
is extremely accurate as long 
as the appropriate positions 
are chosen and as long as the 
number of locations to tap is
kept small. His paper on the 
technology notes that up to 
95 percent accuracy can be 
achieved using certain eas
ily accessible locations on the 
arm.

CMU and UPMC improve 
health record efficiency
PHILIP ORBETA
Staffwriter
The University of Pitts
burgh Medical Center 
(UPMC) has long been rec
ognized as a leader in the use 
of information technology 
solutions within the centers 
health care facilities.
Having been named one 
of the 100 Most Wired hos
pitals and health systems in 
the United States by Hospitals
& Health Networks magazine 
for 10 years in a row, it is no 
question that UPMC strives 
to remain on the frontier of 
medical information technol
ogy and efficiency.
Recently, UPMC has intro
duced a new personal health 
record system that will revo
lutionize the way we manage 
health information.
According to www.upmc. 
com, the system, which was 
a proof-of-concept project 
completed in collaboration 
with Google Health, Carnegie 
Mellon, and dbMotion (a ven
dor of health care solutions), 
will be able to aggregate data 
throughout different UPMC 
settings and ultimately let 
both physicians and patients 
electronically share medical 
information with each other 
in a more efficient and secure 
manner.
A personal health record 
(PHR) commonly refers to an 
individuals electronic health 
record that is initiated and 
maintained by the individual. 
Ideally, a PHR would gather
data from many sources at 
once and provide a complete 
and accurate medical history 
of the individual.
These data could later be 
accessed online, or by other 
means, by physicians, medi
cal practitioners, and people 
who are granted access per
mission by the individual.
A PHR is often confused 
with the more general elec
tronic health record, which 
is generated and maintained 
within an institution, such as 
a hospital or clinic, but serves 
a similar purpose in the sense 
that it operates as a means 
to automate and streamline 
workflow within health care 
systems.
The new PHR system at 
UPMC is credited to the work 
of six candidates in the Mas
ters in the Information Sys
tems Management (MISM) 
program at Carnegie Mellons 
Heinz College.
Under the supervision of 
faculty member Rema Padman, a professor of man
agement science and health 
care informatics, the team 
designed, implemented, and 
tested the system, ultimately 
revealing a demonstration 
of the project in the fall of 
2009.
Six weeks after start
ing the project, the system 
was capable of moving data 
through the dbMotion plat
form, populating the PHR

Aging: Changes over a lifetime
BRIAN LEE
SciTech EditorThe future of DNA computing
ZACHARIAS GEORGE
Staffwriter

Breaking and reforming DNA base pairs is the basis of DNA computing.
Some may view aging as a 
curse; others see it as a sign 
of wisdom or a symbol of re
spect. One thing is for certain: 
The aging process is constant, 
ongoing, irreversible, and will 
affect everyone.
Aging in humans is com
monly associated with a 
change in appearance, an in
crease in frailness, and a gen
eral loss of efficiency in bodily 
functions.
However, these external 
indications are the result of 
gradual changes in the cellu
lar processes of our bodies.
One of the most noticeable 
changes in the body is the ap
pearance of the .skin.
The skin is made of many 
different layers of cells. Ac
cording to www.health-cares, 
net, skin cells divide more 
slowly with age, and an inner 
layer of skin called the dermis 
becomes thinner over time. In 
addition, a protein called col
lagen, which provides struc
tural support, loses elasticity.
Skin changes can be ex
acerbated with repeated sun 
damage. Ultraviolet rays, 
which bombard the skin dur
ing tanning or general sun ex
posure, work to weaken colla
gen. Other factors that affect
collagen elasticity include 
cigarette smoke and ozone.
As we grow older, the 
amount of bone we produce 
decreases. Bones are made of 
many different kinds of cells. 
Although bones seem rigid, 
the old cells are constantly 
being replaced by new cells, 
but aging decreases the rate 
of replenishment, leading to 
frailer bones.
Aacording to an article on 
www.howstuffworks.com, 
bone loss can be aggravated 
by habits such as smoking, 
lack of certain nutrients such 
as calcium and vitamin D, and 
taking certain medications.
However, while loss of 
bone strength is inevitable, it 
can be slowed through normal 
exercise and a non-sedentary 
lifestyle.
Getting shorter as we age 
is related to spongy disks be
tween vertebrae in the spine, 
which lose water over time, 
causing a greater amount of 
compression.
Becoming weaker is a re
sult of deterioration of muscle 
tissue, causing decreased en
durance, size, and strength. 
However, being inactive is a 
greater contributor to muscle 
weakening than aging is.
Simple habits like regular 
exercise and good posture 
may reduce weakening of
muscles over time.
The aging process also 
causes changes in the bodys 
metabolism, or the ability of 
the digestive systems to pro
cess food efficiently.
Older people generally 
have slower metabolisms than 
younger people, meaning that 
fat deposits are created more 
easily. This is why many older 
people seem to gain weight at 
a faster rate than their young
er selves.
Other factors may also be 
involved with weight gain. 
Becoming less active as we 
grow older can also accelerate 
weight gain. In addition, be
cause people lose cells as they 
grow older, they expend less 
energy, but may still eat the 
same amount of food.
However, an article on 
www.healthinaging.org notes 
that people who live in less 
technologically advanced so
cieties do not show weight 
gain patterns, suggesting that 
an individuals activity or eat
ing habits, not the aging pro
cess, may be the direct cause 
of weight gain.
The heart also loses its ef
fectiveness with age, decreas
ing the amount of blood that 
flows through the body. This 
causes people to feel colder
See AGING, A6
Today, all computers have 
the same general structure. 
They have a processing core, 
where instructions are ex
ecuted; some volatile mem
ory, where data is temporar
ily stored; and non-volatile 
memory, where data can be 
stored over longer periods 
of time. Most computers 
have processors operating 
at around 50,000 million in
structions per second (MIPS) 
and non-volatile memory of a 
few hundred gigabytes. This 
is significantly greater than 
the first personal computers, 
having a mere one MIPS pro
cessor, and the capability to 
store only five megabytes of 
data back in 1977,
Moores Law states that the 
number of transistors that can 
be placed on an integrated 
circuit will double every two 
years. There are some funda
mental limits that will be ap
proached eventually.
The size of the transistors 
would approach those of mol
ecules or even atoms eventu
ally, and this would introduce 
elements of unpredictability 
into the circuit. As a result, 
scientists have decided to 
look for alternate methods of 
computing. DNA computing is
one such alternate computing 
method that is catching on in 
certain scientific circles.
The structure of the DNA 
molecule was proposed by 
Nobel laureates James Wat
son and Francis Crick. It is a 
double-stranded helix, and 
the two strands are linked by 
base pairs in the center, which 
are held together by hydrogen 
bonds. There are four base 
pairs, A, T, C, and G, and they 
only connect as A-T and C-G. 
They are repeated millions 
of times on a single double
helix, and owing to the nature 
of the pairs, every base on 
one strand of itie helix has a 
complementary base pair on
the second strand.
Base pairs are separated by 
a distance of 0.33 nanometers 
and, in two dimensions, will 
amount to over 1 million giga
bits of data per square inch, 
over 2000 times greater than 
modern data storage systems.
This is one of the reasons 
Leonard Adleman, a profes
sor of computer science and 
molecular biology at the Uni
versity of Southern Califor
nia, proposed in a 1994 issue 
of the journal Science a new 
method of computing that 
involved using the DNA mol
ecule. His proposal and its

Large Hadron Collider breaks own record
Last Friday, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) managed to ac
celerate two beams of protons up to 3.5 trillion electron volts, 
breaking its own previously set record. Last November, the LHC 
had accelerated particles up to 1.18 trillion electron volts, beat
ing all records set by other particle accelerators.
CERN, the European institute that currently controls the 
LHC, has announced that it will try to cause two of the highenergy beams to collide with each other, producing an energy 
of 7 trillion electron volts. The particle accelerator will attempt 
to simulate the amount of energy and the events that happened 
during the Big Bang.
CERN plans to release a schedule of when it will carry out this 
collision soon. This collision will perhaps be the last high-energy 
collision in the LHC before it shuts down in 2012 for servicing 
and repair. The LHC will remain out of operation for around 18 
to 24 months before it can resume working again.

Scientists show light can twist nanofibers
Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered 
light is capable of twisting strings of nanoparticles. In the study 
published in the journal Science, nanoparticles of cadmium telluride were observed when kept in the light and when left in the 
dark. After 24 hours in the light, these particles formed long, flat 
ribbons. After 72 hours, the ribbons had twisted and had formed 
clumps. When the particles were kept in the dark, they formed 
flat ribbons but did not twist. The researchers have proposed that 
light causes the nanoribbons to twist by causing strong repulsion 
between the individual nanoparticles in the ribbon.
This discovery could have a number of applications in diverse 
fields. Light-controlled electromechanical systems could be cre
ated to help processes such as microchip assembly. Scientists are 
also studying the effect of light on other shapes of nanoparticle 
aggregates, such as spiral-shaped aggregates. If the spirals are 
able to rotate, they can be used for drug delivery into humans.

Mediterranean diet linked to fertility
Studies performed on couples undergoing fertility treatment 
showed that women who were on a Mediterranean-style diet 
had higher chances of getting pregnant. A Mediterranean diet 
contains large amounts of vegetables, vegetable oils, and fish  
those on such a diet were 40 percent more likely to become preg
nant than those who were not on a similar diet.
The study was conducted on 161 couples undergoing fertil
ity treatment in the Netherlands and was published in the jour
nal Fertility and Sterility. The results were generated after the 
couples were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding their eat
ing habits. Most women either had a Mediterranean-style diet 
or a health-conscious diet, which was high in fruits, vegetables, 
grains, fish, and beans. The study discovered that the health
conscious diet did not have a significant effect on the chances 
of pregnancy, but that the Mediterranean diet significantly in
creased chances of pregnancy.

Google Health, and passing 
the information back to the 
central UPMC system.
Following its initial suc
cess, UPMC has announced 
that it plans to deploy this new
system for use by its patients 
by this spring.
While the general public 
shows favor toward PHR sys
tems, their development has 
been hindered by both the dif
ficulty to unify all the technol
ogies used within the health
care setting under one uni
versal platform and the lack 
of a standard way to present 
information that is readable 
and understandable by both 
patients and health care prac
titioners.
dbMotion has developed
a flexible, service-oriented, 
architecture-based interoper
ability platform, which is a 
system that will unify certain 
services under an agreed stan
dard.
Using this platform, the 
new PHR system at UPMC at
tempts to overcome existing 
problems by accepting data 
from all systems even with dif
ferent formats.
It will then organize this 
data into a format that can 
be easily understood by both 
doctors and patients, or others
who need to read the report.
Despite the success of this 
system, there is still a great 
amount of work to be done in 
terms of the standardization 
of medical information indus
try-wide before it is effectively 
streamlined for use.

Bridging the gap between computers and humans
SKINPUT, from A5
with small things in big ways. 
The idea is to be able to ap
propriate other objects to use 
as input devices.
- Harrison feels that one way 
to reduce the size of input de
vices is to make use of some
thing that we already carry 
around with us: our arm.
His previous methods used 
similar technologies to use 
tables as input devices, but as 
Harrison said in an interview, 
you cant take a table every
where you go.
Harrison sees Skinput as 
filling a niche for highly por
table, large-scale input devic
es, possibly complementing 
projectors. Projectors already 
provide us with small devices 
that produce a large output, 
but input devices have not yet 
caught up, he said.
One variation of Harrisons 
technology has a small projec
tor (called a pico projector) 
attached to the Skinput arm 
band, which allows menu 
items and such to be projected
onto the hand.
One application of Skinput 
that Harrison envisions is a 
way to control music players, 
which are already controlled 
by a limited number of but
tons. He envisions a jogger 
tapping her thumb and fore
finger together to skip tracks 
or her thumb and ring finger 
to increase the volume.
This also takes advantage 
of the fact that we are aware 
of the position of our arms 
and fingers without look
ing at them (a phenomenon
called proprioception, as ex
plained on Harrisons website, 
http://www. chrisharrison. 
net/projects/skinput/). This 
enables using devices without 
having to divert our attention 
to them. This could act as an 
extension of devices such as 
the iPod Shuffle, which al
ready functions well without 
a screen.
Whatever the case, Harri
sons projects are on the path 
to bringing the bond between 
humans and computers even 
closer.
Researchers outline plan for DNA computers
DNA, from A5
demonstration as a computing 
method to solve a seven-point 
Hamiltonian path problem (a 
special case of the Traveling 
Salesman Problem) brought 
DNA computing to the fore
front of unconventional com
puting.
There are different ways in 
which a DNA computer can be 
built. On a basic level, all DNA 
computers function by pairing 
bases on the two strands and 
using certain enzymes to cut 
or splice the DNA molecules 
at different locations. The 
DNA computer can be thought 
of as having input data, hard
ware, and software mole
cules. These, when mixed to
gether, react in specific ways 
to produce output molecules
 or solutions  to a given 
problem. As of today, DNA
computers may exist in test 
tubes or as DNA-based logic 
switches, much like the digital 
logic gates in modern comput
ers. These may even be fully 
programmable. The main dif
ference between conventional 
and DNA computing methods 
is the way instructions are 
executed. In conventional 
computers, data is processed 
sequentially, causing an in
crease in the time required to 
solve a problem. DNA comput
ers process data in a parallel 
manner, thereby dramatically 
speeding up processes.
There are drawbacks that 
must be overcome before the 
DNA computer can become 
mass produced. DNA comput
ers require some amount of 
human assistance, which in
creases the overall time to ob
tain a solution to a problem. 
Human interaction is neces
sary when combining the 
mixture of input, software, 
and hardware molecules, and 
a human must also interpret 
the output molecules. Fur
thermore, these computers, 
although capable of parallel 
processing, require amounts 
of DNA that are proportional 
to the complexity of the prob
lem. This could result in ex
tremely large and impractical 
quantities of DNA being used 
to solve equations having hun
dreds of variables. The DNA 
computer today, although 
programmable, only performs 
rudimentary functions, and 
significant advances have to 
be made before the execution 
of more complex functions.
In 2004, Ehud Shapiro of 
the Weizmann Institute of Sci
ence in Israel published the 
results of a study in Nature. 
He created a DNA computer
capable of detecting disease 
in a patient. His study was 
performed in a laboratory 
with test tubes, and his work 
has not been tested on a real 
patient. Preliminary results 
seemed to point to his teams 
DNA computer as a reliable 
approach to the early detec
tion of diseases and cancers.
As DNA is abundant, there 
is no dearth of cheap, raw ma
terials to manufacture these 
computers. They also use far 
less energy than traditional 
computers, according to Na
tional Geographic. While DNA 
computers may not be able to 
run operating systems, games, 
or spreadsheet applications, 
they show great potential for 
heavy data-crunching super
computers. Their use would 
also mean a change in the un
derstanding of computers as 
we know them.
Lowering Cardiovascular Risk 45/063 Maintaining Health
Science For A Better Life
Each year, about 17 million people worldwide die 
of cardiovascular disease. However, there are 
things beyond exercise and diet that can help lower 
your risk.
Thats why the research Bayer Healthcare is 
doing is so important. One of the most studied 
drugs is Aspirin. Low-dose Bayer Aspirin can help 
prevent heart attacks in patients at appropriate 
risk. Aspirin is not appropriate for everyone, 
so people should be sure to talk to their doctors 
before beginning an Aspirin regimen.
Whats more, Bayer is developing innovative 
products for patients at risk for cardiovascular 
disease.
In addition, a promising new substance could 
help prevent the formation of blood clots, and 
thus reduce the risk of stroke. So people can 
continue to lead independent, trouble-free lives.

Privacy nudges protect information
DYLAN MORI
Staffwriter
As more of our affairs can 
be managed online, privacy 
on the Internet becomes more 
of an issue. Research at Carn
egie Mellon has centered on 
the idea of privacy nudges, 
which will give warnings 
when inputting personal in
formation online. A team of 
professors  Lorrie Cranor, 
an associate professor of com
puter science; Alessandro Acquisti, an associate professor 
of information technology and 
public policy; and Norman Sadeh, a professor in the School 
of Computer Science  has 
combined computer science, 
economics, and psychology to 
create this solution.
The privacy nudges 
themselves can be presented 
in a variety of situations. For 
example, if a person is about 
to enter information on a web
site  whether its a name, 
a birthday, a photograph, a 
credit card, or a Social Se
curity number  a message 
would come up warning the 
user that his or her informa
tion might be compromised if 
he or she continues. From that 
point, the user would decide 
whether or not to proceed.
Other examples include 
suggestions to change the de
fault settings for a program 
or scanning an e-mail before 
sending it. In the latter ex
ample, the system scans the 
e-mail to find any indications 
that the e-mail might be con
sidered a flame,  a kind of 
e-mail spam  withholds its 
sending, and at a later time 
asks if it should still be sent. 
As Acquisti describes it, nudg
es are a shortcut, in a way, 
to easier decision-making.
Acquistis main focus is on 
the economics of privacy, 
namely, combining psychol
ogy and classical economics 
to see how individuals act in 
regards to their personal pri
vacy.
This particular field con
tains some uncertainty, since 
there typically is a cognitive 
bias in which many mental 
factors specific to each indi
vidual play different roles in 
decision-making.
From 2003 to 2007, Acquis
tis focus was on discovering 
behaviors in private decision
makers. It was how we can 
explain [decision-makers] 
biases, but it was also how we 
help people overcome their 
biases, said Acquisti. It was 
about pushing safe decisionmaking.
From there, Acquisti de
scribed the merits of soft 
paternalism, which is when 
the government provides in
dividuals with suggestions 
rather than regulations that 
they need to follow. He em
phasized the importance of 
letting users select their own 
preferences when it comes to 
privacy.
Although the team fa
vors individual preference 
in privacy settings, members 
acknowledge that certain 
governmental regulations, 
some suggested by Congress 
and the Federal Trade Com
mission, can be coordinated 
with the nudges in order to 
safeguard against the greatest 
number of potential privacy 
issues.
Onfe of the dangers that 
Acquisti wishes to avoid is 
desensitizing the users to the 
warnings. If the nudges hap
pen too often, the users will 
get annoyed and disregard 
them. When working on the 
project, Acquisti always asks 
himself, When we design a 
new information system, how 
can we provide privacy to the 
user [without seeming insis
tent]?
Other groups have also 
done research on privacy set
tings online. A group at Stan
ford University is focused on 
using human voices to give 
users verbal warnings, while 
a group at Princeton Univer
sity is working to redesign the 
web browser completely.
Next in the process is more 
research on private behaviors 
in a number of different envi
ronments. Work is also being 
done on privacy regarding the 
location tracking service Locaccino, which allows users to 
share their location with their 
friends.
In the meantime, the group 
awaits the approval of their 
National Science Foundation 
grant proposal.
Google has funded the 
nudges; according to Acquisti, 
Theyre keeping their eyes 
very open to research in aca
demia.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
fro
(HoM 1
Maria Raffaele/Art Editor
New SIO improved old system, but needed better PR
Its late March, and the freeze 
over our Steel City is finally starting 
to thaw. Clouds are parting, the sun 
is shining, and flowers are emerging. 
But what is more beautiful than this 
welcomed springtime weather? The 
redesigned Student Information On
line portal, of course.
SIO received a significant over
haul over break. Whereas the online 
interface was previously outfitted 
with an outdated style featuring con
fusing and poorly organized informa
tion sections, the new SIO is more 
suited to students real needs. Users 
can view their grades, schedule, fi
nances, and other information  and
can even see grades charted on a user-friendly (though not always com
forting) line graph. Students can also 
download an unofficial PDF of their 
transcripts directly from the site.
On a campus where more students 
than not seem to be triple-majoring 
and co-chairing multiple student 
organizations, and maintaining an 
above-average grade point average, 
its about time that the software they 
use supports  not challenges  all 
of the aspects of their academic lives 
at Carnegie Mellon.
However, the new SIO systems re
lease and execution should have been 
promoted more effectively, rather
than discovered largely via word of 
mouth through student social net
works. There was little on-campus 
advertising and no official university 
e-mail announcing the systems up
date, or even who was responsible 
for its change.
We look forward to the coming im
provements in some of the other sys
tems that students must access, such 
as On-Line Registration, and even 
the HUBs main webpage. Moreover, 
we hope that such system upgrades 
will be promoted more effectively 
and communicated to the student 
body in a more direct and transpar
ent manner.
Student Senate should see strengthened service
With the campus election sea
son now in full swing, the Elections 
Board announced that, after peti
tion validation, there were no candi
dates running in the Tepper School 
of Business, the Mellon College of 
Science, or the School of Computer 
Science. Not a single undergraduate 
student in any of those three colleges 
had the desire or motivation to have 
their petition signed and to be a part 
of Undergraduate Student Senate.
While we can blame weak mar
keting this election cycle, this is like
ly part of a larger, more long-term 
problem regarding students lack of 
understanding of what Senate is and 
what Senate does. Without under
standing the importance of having 
representation on a college level, 
students see' no need to become rep
resentatives.
We at The Tartan have seen Sen
ate accomplish many of the goals it 
has set out to meet. It sends its rep
resentatives to a number of student 
advisory councils around the uni
versity. It brings in special guests 
and speakers, who ask the Student 
Senators for their opinions. (See 
this weeks story on President Cohon 
on page Al.) It distributes approxi
mately $90,000 per year in special 
allocations to other groups and or
ganizations. Yet, this year, three 
colleges have effectively stated they 
have absolutely no interest in being 
represented, and not a single seat in 
the entire Senate is contested. Every 
person on the ballot will become a 
Senator, and a handful more will 
win with write-in votes in the single 
digits.
The election process for Senate 
is supposed to allow the most quali
fied, most involved, and most enthu
siastic members of each of the col
leges a voice to represent the needs 
and wants of the rest of the members 
of their respective schools. However,
the interests of the individual col
leges cannot and will not be served if 
there are no students to speak up for 
them. And by denying themselves 
a representative in Senate, the stu
dents in these three schools are ef
fectively ensuring that their desires 
will be put at the very bottom of a 
long list. Students need to under
stand that being a part of Senate or 
having a representative on Senate 
championing them is vital.
The Senate elections this year 
are a farce. They are not based on 
credentials or recruiting motivated 
students; they are not even a popu
larity contest. This year, Senate has 
explicitly become a volunteer orga
nization  anyone who wants to can 
join and try to keep student govern
ment functioning.

Sugar tax has good motivation but poor execution
Fighting two problems with one two cents per ounce. This will cause stahl is attempting to put together aFighting two problems with one 
tax proposal, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke 
Ravenstahl is currently aiming to fill 
the hole in the citys budget as well as 
promote healthy living among Pitts
burghers with a new tax on sugarsweetened beverages. In comparison 
with the previously proposed tuition 
tax, this new tax idea  adopted from 
Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutters 
similar legislation  appears to have 
a more practical rationale behind it. 
Yet, when it comes to execution, it 
fails once again.
At present, the tax will raise the 
prices of sweetened beverages by
two cents per ounce. This will cause 
consumers to spend roughly $0.17 
extra when they buy a can of Red 
Bull or $1.35 more for a two-liter 
bottle of Coca-Cola  roughly a 100 
percent tax. When this is compared 
to the pouring tax, currently set at 7 
percent, the disparity is easy to see. 
Looking at it in broader terms, upon 
purchasing 10 two-liter bottles of Co
ca-Cola, consumers will be paying an 
unreasonable $13.50 just in taxes  
a substantial increase in prices that 
seems extreme, especially to consum
ers without deep pockets.
While it is laudable that Ravenstahl is attempting to put together a 
Healthy Pittsburgh Initiative by dis
couraging residents from consuming 
sugar-sweetened beverages, the re
sulting increase in the prices of soda, 
energy drinks, iced tea, and sports 
drinks is unfairly high. Furthermore, 
because the tax is regressive, it is 
harsher on the poor. Currently the 
tax is too large to be justified, and 
while it is fills a necessary gap in the 
citys pension fund, the mayor needs 
to make sure he is not hurting the 
financial welfare of Pittsburghers in 
his various attempts to rake in some 
dough.
Their historical fictions, our alarming facts
(WE1
Once in a while, I like to read a 
textbook whose flash-and-trash con
tent is akin to that of the National Ex
aminer or Star magazine. However, 
since the textbook market tends to 
produce high-quality content (most 
of the time), horrendously written 
textbooks are hard to come by for 
use in this cathartic experience. This 
may all change soon, due to the fact 
that the Texas Board of Education 
recently passed a social studies cur
riculum that will put a conservative 
twist on history and economics. Or, 
less subtly put, bombast you with a 
Republican lovefest.
The vote, 10 to five along party 
lines, will structure history in el
ementary through high school text
books in a way that glorifies the 
Republican Party, stresses American 
capitalism, and asserts that the coun
try was founded solely on Christian 
beliefs. The conservative members of 
the panel justified this as a response 
to what they see as a liberal bias 
in academia. Suddenly, my esteem 
dropped tenfold for these presum
ably grouchy old men sittin on the 
board o education of the great state 
of Texas in their Wrangler jeans and 
their unnecessarily flatulent trucks, 
placing his intelligence somewhere 
between Hugh Hefners girlfriends 
(collectively) and that one chick on 
The Bachelor that everyone hated.
The wizened minds that write 
textbooks to educate our children 
also demonstrated that they can em
ploy subtle tactics in their adoration
of conservative values. Instead of? 1asking hardworking schoolchildren 
to describe the role of Ronald Rea
gan, the textbook will soon prompt 
them to describe Ronald Reagans 
leadership (emphasis added). $ 
later chapter, Im sure, will read 
something like describe George W. 
Bushs leadership in the war on ter
rorism. Discuss the vastly successful 
results in grisly detail.
Students will also be prompted 
to wax elegant about the causes ... 
of the conservative resurgence ...' in-. 
eluding the Moral Majority and the ' 
National Rifle Association. This just 
proves that if theres anything con
servatives like more than thumping 
their Bibles and toting their guns (or 
perhaps thumping their Bibles while 
toting their guns), its pandering to 
stereotypes. This is, after all, a state 
whose small-town tourist brochures 
promote the historical significance
of the local Bible and Rifle Church. Iiknow because Ive seen them.
Looking at the situation from an 
elevated perspective, this might be 
reminiscent of a Darwin Award, ad
equately applied to events that de
serve merit for the way they make 
society regress. As individual Darwin 
Awards recognize individuals who, 
have removed themselves from the 
gene pool with their idiotic actions!, 
the board of education is on its way 
to removing Texas from modern civi
lization. But ironically, that might 
not even matter. Because in 10 or so 
years, no one in the Lone Star Stated 
is going to believe in Darwin anyway. 
Oh, the irony.

Paralympians overcome .; 
obstacles, break records
In the fading noise from the 
closing ceremonies of the Olympic 
games, the Paralympians compete. 
But after two weeks of focused inter
national attention, the media seems 
to move away from sports competi
tion back to the commonplace: the 
economy, new technology, celebrity 
gossip, and ongoing war. Often the 
Paralympics are lost in this return to 
normalcy.
For us, it took a gallery of incred
ible images from this years X Para
lympic Winter Games to even give 
thought to the 506 athletes who 
competed in Vancouver and Whis
tler this past week. A photograph 
of Haitao Du, a cross-country skier 
from China, pictures him competing 
in the 20-kilometer cross-country 
race, with no poles and no arms. A 
photograph from the podium of the 
mens slalom standing event shows 
Australian bronze-medalist Cam
eron Rahles-Rahbula with one leg; 
German silver-medalist Gerd Schonfelder with only one arm; and New 
Zealand gold-medalist Adam Hall, 
who suffers from spina bifida. A shot 
of the United States Patrick Mc
Donald getting ready for his teams 
wheelchair curling game just begs 
the question  how do they even do 
that?
It is a testament to the ability- ' 
and perseverance of these athletes- * 
that the Paralympics can even exist. 
These men and women have over
come disabilities that society views 
as completely debilitating and are 
taking part in an event that defines 
them as some of the top competitors 
in the world.
Originally a portmanteau com-y* 
bining paraplegic with Olympic, the global governing body of1  r 
the games has re-oriented the titlj^ ,. 
to replace paraplegic with parallel. 
They are supporting the ideal of the-,-;, 
Paralympics being a co-event with, 
the Olympic movement, not a sider 
line occurrence. And this is apparent 
to those who pay attention to th-0* 
games. These are incredible perfor-. 
mances of athleticism that unfortju-, , 
nately seem to have fallen out of the, v, 
spotlight. cI.*. \
We want these Olympians to be; v 
granted the same respect as they> 
peers whom we watched, eyes gluecL , > 
to televisions and monitors for days., 
They are every bit as qualified and 
have often come from unimaginable . 
places to reach their dreams. They ; 
deserve our attention as much as thje 
Olympics that fills mass media. c r;;,
So, for the same reasons as for the 
Olympic games, give the Paralym
pics a look next time theyre on  to 
see compelling athletes representing 
their countries, their competitive 
spirits outshining any obstacles that 
may have been placed in their way. , ; <

Israelis, Palestinians can turn crisis into hope
Among the foreign policy dilem
mas faced by United States presi
dents for the last 50 years, that of Is
rael and Palestine seems artfong the 
most intractable.
Republicans and Democrats alike 
have tried to bring the two sides of the 
conflict together, sometimes reach
ing agreements but often watching 
their best efforts come to naught. 
Groups in both the Israeli and Arab 
leadership want peace, but conserva
tive factions of both consistently ruin 
any chance of a solution. Peace in the 
Middle East is possible, though it is 
still many years away. But peace will 
remain a dream if politics like the 
ones seen in the past two weeks take 
precedence over a long-term solu
tion  especially if these challenges 
are not turned to opportunities.
To follow the events that led up to 
the current state of American-Israeli 
relations, some background is nec
essary. In recent weeks, President 
Obama has taken the first steps in his 
attempt at establishing peace in the 
region. Vice President Biden flew to 
the Middle East to speak with Israeli 
and Palestinian leaders and start the 
first of what would be many rounds 
of shuttle diplomacy  where a 
third-party diplomat travels back 
and forth between two sides in a dis
pute. While peace was by no means 
in sight, it seemed like progress could 
indeed be made.
This initiative seemed relatively 
standard for the peace process. A U.S. 
President started diplomatic efforts, 
leaders on both sides maintained 
their desire for peace while stick
ing to their talking points, and most 
peoples expectations were for more 
of the same back-and-forth bicker
ing that the last several decades have 
brought, possibly ending in an agree
ment of some sort.
But something unexpected hap
pened during Bidens visit.
On March 8, the Vice President 
arrived in Israel. A day later, Israel
announced the building of 1600 new 
houses in a West Bank settlement. 
This announcement violated promis
es made to American diplomats and 
threatened to overshadow Bidens 
visit. The outrage that resulted from 
this affront to the United States and 
the Palestinian Authority  from 
the timing as much as the con
tent  overwhelmed Israeli expec
tations. Israels prime minister, Ben
jamin Netanyahu, failed at his first 
attempts at damage control when he 
painted the announcement as a coin
cidence. Since then, diplomats have 
been trying to repair the political cri
sis between allies. Instead of working 
toward a peace settlement with the 
Palestinians, Israel has to work on 
relations with its closest ally and its 
own government.
The current tension between the 
United States and Israel was a result 
primarily of internal Israeli politics. 
It is these politics  both of Israe
lis and Palestinians alike  which 
pose the greatest threat to a promise 
of long-term peace. Israels ruling 
coalition is currently dominated by 
conservatives. Some are moderate, 
like Netanyahu, while others are 
farther to the right, like Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman. 
As a result, the government is forced 
to take a strong stance against Pales
tinian claims simply to maintain its 
legitimacy. Too many concessions 
would destroy the relatively fragile 
coalition.
At the same time, President 
Obama needs to show resolve in 
foreign policy. Accepting too many 
of Israels conditions would remove 
any credibility he might have in the 
Arab world. He is looking to strike a 
delicate balance between establish
ing a committed alliance with Israel 
and allowing for a chance for prog
ress in the peace process. Israels 
settlement announcement during 
Bidens visit made this balance un
tenable. Obamas peace plan was 
stalled literally before it began. The 
majority of the blame for this lies in 
the arrogance of the Israeli govern
ment, which abused its relationship 
with the United States to distract
the peace process and strengthen 
a conservative coalition. Instead of 
strengthening this coalition, though, 
the recent actions have weakened it 
in the eyes of its own citizens, its al
lies, and the rest of the world.
Despite the widespread outrage 
that emerged over the settlement an
nouncement, this diplomatic faux pas 
could be a blessing in disguise for all 
parties involved. Israel cannot hope 
to keep the United States at arms 
length for long, particularly with the 
threat of Iran nearby. The two sides 
must come closer, and Netanyahus 
conservative coalition is more likely 
to change than the Obama adminis
tration, which has many other more 
significant domestic and foreign 
concerns. A more moderate Israeli 
administration offers a better chance 
for peace agreements than the cur
rent one ever will. ,In the end, the 
conservatives tactic of undermining 
America may backfire.
Neither the United States nor Is
rael can succeed without the other. 
Israel needs America to guarantee 
its continued existence in the midst 
of hostile neighbors, and America 
needs Israel for its strategic value as 
a Middle East democracy. As much as 
this mutual dependence helps both 
nations, it also has its drawbacks, 
which the current controversy only 
illustrates.
One of Americas difficulties 
throughout the process of achiev
ing peace in the region has been a 
perception that it is biased toward 
Israel. The United States gives huge 
amounts of foreign aid to the nation, 
including weapons and classified 
technology. Palestinian leaders have 
been hesitant to trust a mediator that 
may n'ot have their best interests at 
heart. If America keeps pressuring 
Israel on foreign policy, it may im
prove the image of the United States 
in terms of its relationship with 
Palestine.
While it is easy to paint both the 
Israelis and Palestinians as simply 
intransigent and impulsive, no major 
decision on either side comes with
out costs and risks weighed in ad
vance. Both peoples exist in a careful 
balance, one that is often violent but 
more often peaceful.
For there to be lasting peace, the 
majority on each side that wants it 
must take action. If both sides wait 
for the other to move first, the status 
quo will exist indefinitely. If the three 
governments involved truly want a 
solution, they will take this diplo
matic mistake and turn it into a new 
beginning.

Maria Raffaele/Art Editor
Bombings cannot become accepted events
Its in the headlines all the time. 
We see it, we read it, and we move 
on. Its just another piece of news. 
Why should we spend more time 
reading about a bombing in some 
foreign country than reading about 
the next football game? I guess not 
everyone does this, but a majority of 
us do. I have been skimming and ig
noring such terrorism-related news 
for a while now. In fact, I tend to look 
at the headline and first figure out 
how many fatalities there were. Four 
dead? Well, thats not too bad, right? 
I mean, weve had terrorist attacks in 
which many more were killed. What 
difference do four more make to the 
ever-growing list of innocent people 
who lost their lives in such attacks?
It was with this attitude that I read 
the news of nine deaths due to a bomb 
blast in a small cafe in India. Nine, I 
thought, thats not such a big deal. In
dias seen worse. And then I read the
name of the city where it happened. 
Pune. My hometown. I read the name 
of the caf. The German bakery  a 
place Ive passed a number of times 
and heard friends telling me I had
I wished others 
would understand 
that bombs in cafs 
arent everyday 
things.
to go to because of the great food. I 
never went inside, and I never will be 
able to now. I sat staring at the news 
piece incredulously for a while. This 
was the first time that something like 
this had happened in Pune.
Heres some background info 
that will help you understand my 
disbelief. Pune is a sleepy city. Espe
cially when compared to its neighbor, 
Mumbai, Pune is more of a town than 
a city. Most Shops in Pune close from
noon to 4 p.m. People need to eat 
lunch and then take a nice nap. The 
streets are either filled with a num
ber of small colleges or are taken up 
by cafs and restaurants. For a typi
cal lfPunekar, life is all about eating, 
sleeping, eating, studying a little (if 
youre a student), and sleeping and 
eating some more. Its a great city and 
a great life, and you can probably tell 
why. Now imagine a bomb blast rip
ping through one of the citys prized 
cafs and breaking the serenity of this 
perfect little picture. Disbelief? My 
reaction exactly.
After the disbelief had faded, 
panic started creeping in. My parents 
usually never go to that part of town
 would they have gone there today? 
Were my friends safe? Once the panic 
had completely settled in, there was 
the frantic search for the list of the 
dead  I wanted to make sure I knew 
none of them.
It was a small bomb blast. Nine 
deaths (although the number rose to 
17), and I cared. I cared a lot. I went 
on campus after I read the news arti
cle, wondering why everyone wasnt
as upset about the situation as I was. 
I realize now that I cared because it 
happened in the city I grew up in and 
lovewhy would anyone else care as 
much? But at that moment, I wished 
they would. I wished others would 
understand that bombs in cafs arent 
everyday things.
Its been a month since the blast 
happened and it has made me under
stand that for every such situation, 
there is somebody out there who does 
care; that somebody probably also 
wishes that you would care about it. 
Its not possible to be as moved by the 
situation as someone who has per
sonal links with it, but it is possible 
to give such happenings a little more 
thought than we do now. It is possible 
to at least try to care, to at least read 
through the entire news article on the 
subject, to at least realize that this is 
a serious matter. Bombings arent 
normal, and we should stop treating 
them as if they were.

I dont think it is any secret that 
the Carnegie Mellon Greek com
munity has come under a lot of 
duress lately. Individual circum
stances and bad decisions have 
naturally led some in the campus 
community to question whether a 
Greek system does more good than 
harm.
From my own familiarity with 
the quad, Greek life is such a valu
able part of the student experience 
that it is hard to imagine Carnegie 
Mellon without it. When I was a 
first-year and considering which 
house to join, I picked Kappa Delta 
Rho because of the relationships 
that I had made with the broth
ers throughout Orientation week 
and their fall and spring rush. As 
I pledged in the spring semester, 
I learned the value of service and 
philanthropy, and the importance 
of facilitating a social scene at Car
negie Mellon  something that is 
not always easy to find. Though 
we had a disappointing spring
2007 competing in Booth, Buggy, 
and Greek Sing, my brothers and I 
learned a valuable lesson from our 
own failures. The following year, 
we worked together and performed 
much better, with notable secondplace performances in Booth and 
Greek Sing. And finally, last spring 
we won Booth, won Greek Sing 
with Kappa Alpha Theta, had our 
second-best time ever as a house 
in Buggy, and  most important of 
all  led fraternities with 16 hours 
of community service per brother.
Last spring, I also decided to 
run for student body vice presi
dent. My biggest supporters were 
my brothers, and without them 
I would not have had this years 
tremendous experience in service 
to the campus. Near the end of 
the spring semester, bad decisions 
by the fraternity as a whole led to 
our being removed from campus. 
Obviously it was difficult to expe
rience the volatile ups and downs 
of last spring, but what made me 
feel worst was knowing that future 
students would be deprived of the 
experiences that I had at KDR.
Good risk management is key 
for students partaking in the Greek 
system. However, it has gotten to 
the point where nearly all Greek 
students engage in practices of 
hiding risk rather than manag
ing risk, and that is a fault of the 
individual houses, Interfraternity 
Council, and the Greek commu
nity as a whole. Under the current 
risk management structure of our 
Greek Quad, risk management au
thorities are pressured to hide risk 
rather than manage it because of 
unrealistic standards of acceptable 
risk. The circumstances resemble 
enforcing Prohibition in the 1920s, 
and the lengths to which speak
easies would go to not get caught. 
Despite these faults of the Greek 
system, it is built on strong mer
its, and members of the commu
nity should look to these merits 
when making decisions that affect 
their safety and the safety of those 
around them.
March Madness has begun, and people have been following their brackets. So we asked,
Which team do you think should have made it into the NCAA field?

Swimming and diving competes against the best at NCAAs
DEVIN BEAHM
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon mens 
and womens swimming and 
diving teams competed this 
weekend at the 2010 NCAA 
Swimming and Diving Cham
pionships in Minneapolis.
For the womens team, sole 
competitor junior Molly Ev
ans swam the 200-yard back
stroke, placing second in the 
consolation final with a time of 
2:03.68. Evans also competed 
in the 200-yard freestyle, plac
ing 12th, and the 500-yard 
freestyle, placing 10th. Evans 
also earned her third career 
Honorable Mention All-American. Overall, Evans tallied 19 
points to finish 34th out of 51 
swimmers.
I think the way the meet 
went was a great way to end 
my season, said Evans. Al
though my backstroke wasnt 
where Ive been in the past, I 
know that this will keep me 
humble and motivate me to 
work hard this summer.
For the mens swimming 
team, first-year Dan GlaserGarbrick placed eighth in the 
200-yard butterfly with a time 
of 1:51.08, earning his first 
All-America honor. Senior 
Scott Moorby competed in the 
100-yard backstroke and took 
third with a career-best time
of 50.34. Like his fellow team
mate, Moorby picked up an 
Honorable Mention All-Amer
ican title. The mens 800-yard 
freestyle relay also swam at 
the meet, setting a new school 
record with the team of se
nior Jeff Dahlen, junior Frank 
Olechnowicz, senior Gates 
Winkler, and junior Alex Han
son.
The team earned Honor
able Mention recognition, 
placing 12th in the race with a 
new school record of 6:48.37.
It was really cool getting 
top eight as a freshman, said 
Glaser-Garbrick. It was a real 
thrill to be up there on the po
dium at my first nationals and
I can only hope to build on this 
success over my next three 
years.
Olechnowicz, who also 
made his championships de
but at the meet, added, Mak
ing nationals and then getting 
All-America was a great ex
perience. It was great being 
able to accomplish something 
greater than the goals I had 
set for myself and I couldnt 
have been more joyful making 
this meet and succeeding like 
I did.
On the last day of the 
championships, senior Jonas 
Altman-Kurosaki placed sixth 
in the 1650-yard freestyle, 
earning All-American hon
ors with a time of 15:46.72. 
Olechnowicz also swam this 
event, and received his sec
ond Honorable Mention AllAmerican honor at the meet. 
Olechnowicz placed 12th in 
the event, with a career-best 
time of 15:58.27. Winkler fin
ished 17th in 16:10.44.
Dahlen swam the 200-yard 
backstroke, earning an Hon
orable Mention All-American 
honor for his performance, 
and placed second in the con
solation final with a careerbest and school record time 
of 1:48.97. Moorby also com
peted in the event, finishing 
25th in the preliminaries with 
a time of 1:52.50. The mens
File Photo
team was able to place five 
swimmers overall during the 
meet in the top 16, finishing 
out the second at the NCAA 
competition placing 15th out 
of 61 schools.
That was the perfect way 
to round out my swimming ca
reer, said Dahlen. Its nice to 
know I went out with a bang, 
and even the day afterwards, I 
still feel fantastic.
This marks the end of the 
season for the swimming and 
diving team. Competition will 
resume next season in Octo
ber.

Track and field travels to UAAs College basketball in spotlight
ALLYSON KOYEN
Staffwriter
zieto The Carnegie Mellon track 
and field team competed in 
the University Athletic As
sociation (UAA) champion
ships at Brandeis University 
on March 6. The mens team 
placed fourth overall while 
the women took seventh.
The highlight of the meet 
for the men was senior James 
Hulleys performance, with 
a win in both the weight 
throw and the shot put. In the 
weight throw, Hulley man
aged a distance of 16.35 me
ters. Senior Chris Fornataro 
put up a strong performance 
and placed behind Hulley, 
throwing a distance of 15.12 
meters. In the shot put, Hulley 
took the gold with a throw of 
16.07 meters. \
The Tartan men cohtinued 
to dominate on the field. Se
nior Chris Bridgman tied for 
second place in the pole vault, 
reaching a height of 4.40 me
ters.
Junior Pat OBrien also 
had a stellar meet, finishing 
sixth in three events. The first 
of these was in the high jump, 
where he cleared a height of
1.81 meters. He also scored 
sixth in the long and triple 
jump, leaping 6.40 meters and 
13.11 meters, respectively.
Junior Nate Bussiere 
scored third in the mile, fin
ishing in 4:21.36, while team
mate sophomore Rob Morhard 
finished the 800-meter run in 
1:18:07, earning sixth place. 
Finally, the 4x400 relay com
posed of Bussiere, OBrien, 
junior Dustin Musselman, 
and first-year John Caverhill, 
grabbed third in 3:26.49. 
With a final strong showing 
to end their season, the men 
have much to be proud of.
On the womens side, the 
seventh-place finish was dec
orated with two new school 
records. The first was set by 
sophomore Luci Laffitte, who 
placed fourth in the 55-meter 
hurdles with a time of 8.94 
seconds.
The second school record 
was set by the distance med
ley relay team of junior Laura 
McKee, senior Crystal LeePow, senior Diane Mattingly, 
and junior Courtney Baker, 
which placed sixth with a 
time of 12:25.75.
Everyone ran really well 
in the relay. All the teams were
very competitive in the relay, 
and although we didnt do as 
well, we all put out our best, 
McKee said. Training this 
winter has been really rough 
with the weather, but we did 
well considering the circum
stances. As for NCAAs, were 
just hoping to improve and do 
well in the spring season.
Mattingly also shone in 
the 400-meter run, finishing 
fourth in 1:00.39. In addition, 
Laffitte, LeePow, Mattingly, 
and Baker joined forces once 
again in the 4x400-meter re
lay to score fifth, with a time 
of 4:10.51.
On the field, the women 
continued to meet with suc
cess. Sophomore Ivana Moses 
scored fifth in the triple jump, 
hitting the 10.42-meter mark. 
She was closely followed by 
junior Melissa Hwang, who 
earned seventh in the event, 
leaping 10.27 meters. Junior 
Morgan Faer threw a career 
best of 12.21 meters in the 
weight throw, coming in sev
enth.
Finally, in the pole vault, 
sophomore Lisa Marion Gar
cia cleared a careerbest of 
2.60 meters, finishing ninth 
in the conference.

follow. They are simple to use 
and add features to simplify it 
even further.
Not that picking the win
ner based on statistics is even 
necessarily what the tourna
ment is about. Josh Plotnik, 
a junior biology major, said, 
March Madness is about 
rooting for the underdog and 
watching the big dogs fail. 
Everyone hopes to win their 
bracket, but in reality, they 
would much rather see their 
championship pick lose to a 
15 seed in the first round. 
Because the tournament is 
so unpredictable, you never
know what to expect.
Junior chemical engineer
ing major Eric Roudabush 
added, Odds of picking a 
perfect bracket are horrible. 
There is lots of luck involved, 
but its fun to try to pick up
sets.
By picking a winner for 
each game, each matchup be
comes important. Its not just 
the final winner who counts. 
Roudabush explained, You 
only have one favorite team. 
By making a bracket you can 
find a team you dont really 
know to root for just so you 
can have a good bracket. 
McKee had a similar idea. 
We dont have a team here at
CMU, but by picking teams in 
your bracket, you have some
one to cheer for.
Even watching the games 
has become easier. The NCAA, 
in collaboration with cbssports.com, streams the action 
live on their website. I watch 
as many as I can. This year I 
was a little busy, but Ive seen 
at least parts of eight or 10 of 
the games, Roudabush said.
So while bandwagoning 
might get a bad rap, I dont 
mind it. College basketball 
gets the national spotlight 
for a few weeks, and anyone, 
from die-hard fans to con
fused bandwagoners, can en
joy it all the same.

Womens tennis defeats #10 Redlands, #7 Pomona-Pitzer over break
gg|dm]fdra
Oanct fht day away*.
JEREMY KING
Staffwriter
Just last week, the Carn
egie Mellon womens tennis 
team, ranked 11th in Division 
III, competed in California for 
the teams traditional spring 
break trip. After starting out 
slowly and getting used to 
the nice weather, the Tartans 
overcame some recent losses 
to finish the trip with a record 
of 3-1, leaving them at 8-3 
overall.
The Tartans started off 
their spring break play by trav
eling to Chapman University, 
a team that was ranked 23rd 
at the time. Under the beating 
sun, the Tartans staked them
selves to an early 2-1 lead in
doubles. Sophomore Court
ney Chin and junior Kelly Hart 
ground their opponents down 
for a win at second doubles 
with a score of 8-4. The third 
doubles team of j unior Jennifer 
Chui and freshman Alex Tapak 
steamrolled their opponents 
to put the Tartans in the lead 
going into the always-competitive singles play. Unfortunate
ly for the Tartans, singles did 
not work out as they expected. 
Singles wins by Chin and fel
low sophomore Cze-Ja Tam 
got the Tartans one win away 
from clinching, but they were 
unable to finish. In a grueling 
sixth singles match, senior 
Alisa Liebowitz fell short by a 
score of 6-3, 0-6, 6-3, hand
ing the Tartans a surprising
loss to begin spring break.
Later in the week, the 
Tartans looked forward to 
redeeming themselves after 
a disappointing start. Their 
next match was against 10thranked University of Redlands. 
With the boisterous Redlands 
fans looking on, Carnegie Mel
lon jumped out to take a 2-1 
lead by winning at the first 
and third doubles spots. The 
Tartans then showed the Bull
dogs who was the better team, 
winning five of the six singles 
matches. The match was not 
without drama, however,- as 
Chin had a marathon match at 
first singles. After dropping the 
first set, Chin used the support 
of her fellow Tartans along 
with a big forehand to capture
the match in a tiebreaker.
TWo days later, the women 
traveled to seventh-ranked 
Pomona-Pitzer College for a 
date with the Sagehens. From 
the beginning of the match, 
the Tartans took control, mak
ing sure that their opponents 
knew that they were the better 
team. After sweeping all three 
doubles matches, the Tar
tans clinched the match eas
ily by winning five out of six 
singles matches. One notable 
match came from Chui, play
ing fourth singles, who beat a 
tough Pomona-Pitzer player 
with a score of 7-5, 6-2. For 
the Tartans, this was a huge 
win, and their second in a 
row over a top-10 nationally 
ranked team.
Hard work 
and focus is 
what it takes 
to compete at a 
top level.
Ashley Herrick
The Tartans then conclud
ed a successful spring break 
by handily defeating Trinity 
College (Texas) with a score 
of 8-1. Chin, who played first 
singles most of the week, went 
undefeated at that spot by fin
ishing with a convincing 6-0, 
6-2 win.
By finishing the week with 
a 3-1 overall record, the Tar
tans notched some muchneeded wins after a string of 
disappointing losses.
We were able to get our 
momentum back this week, 
junior Ashley Herrick said. 
Hard work and focus is what 
it takes to compete at a top 
level.
The Tartans will contin
ue their quest for a national 
championship against Califor
nia University of Pennsylvania 
at home on Wednesday at 4 
p.m.

amLQEiDuke Miller shines on and off the tennis court
SARA WINGEN
Staffwriter
With the snow melted away and spring show
ing signs of being here for good, Carnegie Mellons 
spring sports season is underway. Notably, the mens 
tennis team is currently ranked ninth in the country 
in Division III. While the team was competing in Cla
remont, Calif, for their spring break trip, first-year 
Duke Miller was named the University Athletic Asso
ciations (UAA) Mens Tennis Athlete of the Week for 
his several victories in singles and doubles, paired 
with sophomore teammate Jeremy King.
Miller hails from Poway, Calif., which lies north 
of San Diego. Although Miller notes the extreme 
variation of Pittsburgh weather as a cool college 
experience, he would ideally like to return to sunny 
Southern California to pursue a career in biomedical 
engineering after he graduates. Aside from having a 
busy schedule with school and tennis, Miller has a 
passion for producing and mixing music from vari
ous genres, which he hopes to maintain as a hobby 
throughout his life.
Adjusting to college life has been a positive expe
rience for Miller, which he credits to being a part of 
the tennis team. Im very happy that I have tennis, 
as it has provided me with a close group of friends 
that I could hang out with and relate to, right when 
school started at a time when I knew less people and 
wasnt used to college life, he said. While Carnegie 
Mellon has raised his personal expectations to a 
higher level, Miller is enjoying the balance of ath
letics and academics so far. Miller originally began 
playing tennis at age 11, and his familys background 
in the sport has urged him to keep playing into col
lege. With a spot within the national top 10 right 
now, Miller hopes that the Tartans will continue to 
climb the rankings as the season progresses, and 
hopes that he can continue to add to the teams suc
cess.

KRISTEN SEVERSON
Publisher
Its that special time of 
year again, when the madness 
starts.
Last Thursday, the mens 
NCAA basketball tournament 
kicked off and, as usual, didnt 
fail to disappoint. There were, 
of course, the expected games, 
such as first-seeded Ken
tuckys win over 16th-seeded 
Eastern Tennessee State, but 
upsets were to be found as 
well. 14th-seeded Ohio beat 
third-seeded Georgetown, 
and 15th-seeded Robert Mor
ris came surprisingly close to 
victory over second-seeded 
Villanova in overtime. Every
ones bracket is certainly hurt
ing after first-seed Kansas lost 
to ninth-seed Northern Iowa 
in a close match. The tourna
ment is off to a great start, 
and it will certainly have even 
more twists and turns before 
the champion is decided on 
April 5.
If the 63 games occur
ring arent over the span of a 
little more than three weeks 
enough for you to be at least 
slightly interested in the 
tourney, the potential to get 
involved using brackets just 
might. Although every NCAA 
tournament is filled with 
great basketball playing, its 
almost more impressive to see 
how many people get involved
in the action. If there was ever 
a time to jump on the band
wagon, this is it.
Ill admit myself that I have 
not watched a full college bas
ketball game all year. But that 
didnt stop me from staying 
up until almost 2 a.m. making 
sure that my bracket would be 
ready to go so I wouldnt miss 
out on the action. My family 
makes a pool every year and 
there was no way I was going 
to miss out in the prize money, 
trash-talking, or cheering that 
goes along with it.
Junior chemical and bio
medical engineering major 
Laura McKee explained the 
hype. Filling out a bracket 
is my way to be involved in 
March Madness. Its a really 
exciting tournament, and fill
ing out brackets makes it even 
more fun to watch the games, 
McKee said.
Not to date myself, but 
I remember the days when 
I got my bracket from the 
newspaper and wrote the 
teams in myself. But now 
with more easily accessible 
blank brackets, theres no ex
cuse to not make a bracket. 
Websites such as ESPN.com, 
Yahoo!, and even Facebook 
make brackets accessible at 
the click of a button. They 
even update automatically, 
making them even easier to 
use. Ive used multiple sites at 
a time for the different pools
I participate in. At one point, 
I was checking three differ
ent websites  one for family, 
one for friends, and one for 
work  to track my progress 
within each group.
Even though I dont watch 
the games all season long, I 
can access game analysis and 
previews, which are often 
linked right to the matchup
March 
Madness is 
about rooting 
for the 
underdog and 
watching the 
big dogs fail.

In sunny Claremont, Ca
lif. during spring break, the 
number-nine Carnegie Mellon 
mens tennis team was busy 
defeating several top teams 
from the Western region. The 
Tartans prevailed over Chap
man University, number-17 
Redlands University, and 
number-13 Trinity University 
on their trip to bring their sea
son record to 10-4.
The Tartans started their 
first match of the break with 
a 9-0 victory over Chap
man University. After a quick 
sweep of doubles to put Car
negie Mellon ahead 3-0, the 
Tartans took the remaining six 
singles in straight sets, with 
the exception pf senior James 
Muliawan, who topped his 
opponent 10-4 in a third-set 
tiebreak.
Two days later the Tartans 
were able to face their long
time rival, the University of
Redlands. The third time was 
the charm, as the Tartans were 
able to decisively overcome 
the Bulldogs 6-3 after losing 
5-4 the previous two years. 
First-year Duke Miller and 
partner sophomore Jeremy 
King added the only doubles 
point to the total, beating their 
opponents 8-6. Not wanting a 
repeat of the previous years 
losses, the Tartans rallied 
from 1-2 and won five singles 
matches to give them the win. 
Notable wins came from ju
nior Alex Nemerov and firstyear Harsha Rad, 6-3, 6-1, 
and 6-3, 6-2, respectively.
This week showed us what 
we need to work on, since we 
were down in doubles against 
all three ranked teams-we 
played, Spero noted. I was 
impressed with our singles, 
though, especially against 
Redlands.
The real strength test for 
the Tartans came during their 
third match, when the Tartans 
faced fifth-ranked Claremont
Mudd-Scripps in an evening 
match. With the natural ele
ments working against the 
normally indoor court-conditioned Tartans, they were 
unable to gain an early ad
vantage from the doubles 
matches. The only win came 
from the number-one dou
bles duo of Muliawan and his 
partner, senior Niko Ljuboja. 
Muliawan also won the only 
singles match against the Athenas, topping Ronald Wu 6-3, 
6-2. This loss (7-2) would be 
the only one of the trip, how
ever.
This was a really tough 
tearp, but the difference be
tween them and us wasnt 
that significant, Ljuboja com
mented.
With only one day left in 
their vacation, the Tartans 
faced their final and most 
determined opponents yet. 
Number-13 Trinity Univer
sity had a well-balanced team, 
with tough players in spots 
one through six. At the end of
the doubles round, the Tartans 
found themselves down 2-1, 
with the single point coming 
thanks to the duo of King and 
Miller.
As the singles round pro
gressed, the Tigers kept the 
Tartans on edge with sharp 
playing and unorthodox tac
tics. Miller contributed a win 
at fourth singles, 6-3, 6-4, 
while senior Jonathan Spero 
breezed through his match 
at fifth singles, dropping only 
four games, 6-1, 6-3. With 
the score showing a slim 3-2 
Tartan lead, the outcome of 
the match was still unclear. 
Nemerov finished his match 
a short while later, winning in 
three and coming back from 
being down 4-6. The final 
point came from junior Bobby 
MacTaggart. MacTaggart, who 
plays a power game, faced an 
opponent also named Bobby, 
who loved hitting the ball 
with brute force just as much

Students explore virtuality
wats:ON? Festival familiarizes attendees with new technologies
Maybe you dont spend most Friday nights 
teleconferencing across the Atlantic with a 
3-D-rendered cube-man showing you a series of 
short films created using video game engines.
Or maybe you do. If you were at Friday nights 
Machinima Film Festival, you certinly did.
"Machinima? you say. Sounds like robot porn, or the 
internal mechanics of some sort of ancient device 
put on display. No, this machinima is a portmanteau 
of machine-cinema (with a misspelling, because 
who doesnt love an extra "i?). Since the late 
'80s, the hacker art of creating film-like sequences 
through video games has found a home and a 
community through the world of machinima.
The wats:ON? Festival is a yearly event sponsored in 
the memory of Jill Watson. Watson was a Carnegie 
Mellon alumna and adjunct faculty member in the 
School of Architecture who was killed in a plane 
crash. This years focus was on virtuality. An 
Anthony McCall art installation, a talk by media 
archaeologist Erkki Huhtamo, and the work of 
Gordon Matta-Clark and Ernie Geer, as well as the 
Machinima Film Festival.
The film festival was held to give an introduction 
to an accessible virtual space. The films were 
constructed from common environments: the city 
streets of every car-racing game, the canyons 
of Halo, the bedrooms of The Sims. It is in these 
spaces that the filmmakers created their narratives, 
manipulating the familiar world of the video game.
And between these shorts, Friedrich Kirschner 
added his clever commentary. Kirschner, a 
machinimist himself, included ,(by request of the 
curators) one of his own works, peison2184. The 
three-part series is a lushly shaded experience 
following a solitary individual who roams the streets 
of a dark, dystopian vision of a city of the future. 
Without being told, one would never expect that the 
film was created using the Unreal Tournament 2004 
game engine, as Kirschner completely re-skinned 
the environment.
And while having your German host for the evening 
communicate with the audience over Skype may 
seem awkward, for this event it was perfect. His 
presence was brought to us through a character 
named Bob he controlled in real time. And with 
only a webcam to see the audience, he managed 
questions with a casual grace and an honest ability 
to get a room thousands of miles away to laugh.
The breadth of these films shows the potential for 
the future of the genre. Barriers to entry are low:
All that is needed is a touch of creativity to add 
a suicidal slant to a future where humans are all 
connected to the network through unstoppable 
addiction, or to turn a flight simulator into 
slapstick-esque comedy. Machinima already has 
a yearly festival with its own awards, but as video 
games increase in their reach, this subversive art is 
only given more room to grow.

Everything you need to know
About flying high and opening new doors
Dear Hoskins Brothers, Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I fly Southwest, and every 
time Im getting on my 
plane to Pittsburgh, there 
are tons of really smoking 
hot girls on the flight who 
go to Pitt, Point Park, and 
sometimes even Carnegie 
Mellon! The flight has 
open seating; (to I just sit 
next to a girl? What if one 
sits next to me?
Miles higher
Dear Miles,
This is one of the most 
troubling social questions to 
date, and one Brian , and I 
have discussed extensively 
on our own flights. The three 
different boarding groups (A, 
B, and C) each have different 
kinds of girls, and you need 
to put yourself in the position 
to find the one that is right 
for you. Any passenger in 
the A group is going to be 
really conscientious. Who 
else would take the time to 
confirm their flight at exactly 
the right time? The B girls are 
going to be laid-back types, 
and the C girls are going 
to be complete flakes who 
forgot they even had a flight.
As the different groups get 
on the plane, you need to 
position yourself in the right 
boarding group. The optimal 
choice is to be in the midto late-B range so you can 
nonchalantly sit anywhere. 
When you get there, be sure 
to strike up a conversation 
immediately. Dont worry 
about messing up; she 
cant walk away from you at 
30,000 feet!
Fly closer to the sun,
Patrick Hoskins
I met this girl and we really 
hit it off, but I havent had 
a chance to talk with her 
since! i only ever bump 
into her at the entrance 
to our building, and I hold 
the door for her to get in. 
She always seems happy 
to see me. How do I go 
from opening the door to 
opening her heart?
Patiently awaiting 
talking time with you
Dear P.A.T.T.Y.,
First things first, you need to 
be sure your door-opening 
sends the right message. 
Dont open the door too soon; 
it seems way too needy. If you 
have to, slow down when you 
know shes walking behind 
you to ensure good door 
arrival time. Also, open the 
door to an angle between 90 
and 85 degrees. Over 90 and 
shell think youre a pushover. 
Under and you seem a little 
less interested.
Next, after letting her through, 
be sure to walk beside her, 
not behind her, down the hall. 
Since your entire relationship 
seems to be door-centered, 
try and use that shtick to start 
talking. Ask her if she knows 
how to open a door or, for 
that matter, tie her shoes, 
call elevators,  or pump 
gas (Jersey girls only). Its 
important that you develop 
an inside joke with her and 
form some sort of history.
That ought to put your foot 
in the door,
Brian Hoskins

Tales from abroad: Europe
Read along as this writer spends her winter break touring the European countryside
House was more beautiful but smaller. Jae and I joked 
among ourselves that we would have to go to Vienna to 
compare  and we actually did.
New Years Eve (Vienna, Austria):
The New Years celebration in Vienna was so active and 
exciting. We started our Old Town tour at St. Stephen's 
Basilica, the most prominent building in the area. As 
a unique tradition for New Years in Vienna, every 
vendor sold items related to pigs: miniatures, statues, 
pins, and hats. There were 11 stages spread out over 
the old town for entertainment, and people, mostly 
older couples, celebrated by dancing near the stage 
front  congo lines were spontaneously being formed. 
Pig hat aficionados gathered for pictures and laughs, 
mothers boogied with their children, and young folk felt 
the rhythms of new-age music DJs. Something I found 
unexpected was the overwhelming number of American 
songs being played, for example Trains Stand By Me." I 
liked the freedom of breaking into dance, walking with a 
beat, acting easy and blending in with others who were 
full of only joy on that festive night. I was struggling to 
learn new German words  I had asked a few times 
how to say "happy new year," but I still cant remember 
how. Walking through the streets of the Old Town was 
beautiful. The path of celebrations was denoted by lights 
and banners above the pavement. Fireworks were set 
off everywhere and I couldnt avoid thinking of home 
during this night. I was frustrated that I didnt know the 
words to Auld Lang Syne, but my friend Stanley and I 
decided to whistle along all night.
Jan. 2 (Vienna, Austria):

One positive thing about traveling is that one learns 
how one interacts with various people. In museums, 
do you walk behind other viewers or quickly in front of 
them? Do you let someone in front of you in the queue 
or feel like youve "earned that spot? Do you welcome 
unexpected conversations with a band of peaceful 
protesters against destroying a park? Do you have the 
patience to withstand hours of, in my mind, unnecessary 
photography? I hear traveling is a way to becoming more 
aware of yourself, and that notion of exploring the world 
is a Western mindset.
Jan. 3 (Salzburg, Austria):
Sliding down snow banks on the only sled I had  my 
back  lightened my spirits. The untainted snow in 
Salzburg tasted like carrots somehow, a sweet tinge to . 
the snow that clung to fences and leaves.
Jan. 7 (Cesky Krumlov, Czech Republic):
Early rise, prepare a to-go breakfast, say goodbye to my 
friend Ping, and run to catch our bus to Cesky Krumlov. 
Jae walked fast and got us to the station on time. After a

three-hour bus journey, we made our way to the Old 
Town and had a traditional Chinese lunch. We watched 
the town Christmas tree get taken down, de-limbed, and 
chopped up. This was quite funny to watch as tourists 
in a quaint town. We relaxed here because we had a 
lot of time before sunset and not much to see since we 
had missed a few tours already. Walking around the 
town was exciting. Cobblestones and little alleyways, 
monastery gardens, and brightly painted houses filled 
Cesky Krumlov. Red roofs and snow were everywhere. 
There was a castle up on a hill that was surrounded by 
a bear moat. (The bears were indoors today). The castle 
was decorated, not with actual stonework or sculptures, 
but with painted imitations. The walls were painted 
'with images of stone, detailing, shadows, frescoes, and 
exterior siding. From afar the effect was believable, but 
from up close it was simply hilarious. The painters even 
changed the direction of the shadows on the "stones 
for actual lamp positions. We walked through the castle 
and out the other side, arriving at a large field. My friend 
Stanley said that it reminded him of China, but to me it 
was the Pennsylvanian countryside  small field, trees, 
and small rounds. The days passed like this: Oh that 
street looks exciting and new  do we know where it 
goes? No, does it matter? No. "Okay, lets go!" Oh, 
wait. Let me take a photo first.
There is nothing like touring Europe.

The following is an account of one student's adventure 
through Europe over winter break.
Dec. 29 (Budapest, Hungary):
Overnight trains are very difficult to enjoy without a 
sleeper. Border patrol at 5 a.m., the extreme heat of the 
Romanian trains, and the lack of leg room can get on a 
persons nerves. My friend Jae and I got to the station at 
around 10 a.m. Budapest time. Our smartest decision at 
the train stations was to buy a 24-hour transport pass; 
all day we hopped on and off the metro and tram lines 
only caring about our next destination. It was also a nice 
feeling having the local currency on hand. We took the 
metro, which had only three lines, and the tram to our 
hostel. In some locations, like at Heroes Square, you 
go down approximately 15 stairs and there is the metro 
platform! It was very accessible 1 if only Londons metro 
was similarly convenient. The Budapest Opera House 
was splendid inside  adorned with gold everywhere.
I think that was my first time in an opera house, and it 
was everything I had come to imagine. I kept placing 
the characters from Jane Austens Persuasion, Anne 
and Frederick, in the audience or Edmond Dantes in 
one of the boxes using the opera as a social opportunity. 
My favorite part of the opera house tour was the 
historical connection. The opera house was built in the 
Austro-Hungarian empire, and the ruling family based in 
Vienna demanded a less-grand opera house be built in 
Budapest so as not to compete with Viennas own city 
theater. The tour guide said that the Budapest Opera

Revisiting the rabbit hole
Tim Burton reinvents a Disney classic in Alice in Wonderland
We  re all mad here. 
The Cheshire Cats haunting words to Alice upon 
their first meeting aptly describe the incredible and 
insane world she has fallen into. However, though 
tea parties and amazing visuals were plentiful, 
madness seemed rather scarce in director Tim 
Burtons version of the nonsensical classic.
The film opened on March 5, and like some other 
recent productions such as Avatar, it was shown 
in 3-D. If you havent seen a recent movie in 3-D, 
its worth the $10.50 plus popcorn. Gone are the 
pink-tinted blurs of earlier films, and in its place are 
incredibly detailed graphics.
Burton as the director of a goldmine of insanity such 
as Alice in Wonderland sounds like a recipe for a 
wonderful, crazy story. However, contrary to the 
hopes of many Lewis Car oil and Burton fans, the plot 
was neither enthralling nor unique.
The premise of the plot is interesting in itself. The 
film combines two of author Carolls best-known 
works  Alice in Wonderland, and the poem The 
Jabberwocky  to create a coming-of-age quest in 
which an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to 
Wonderland, referred to as Underland in the movie, 
to find that the Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter) 
has taken over. In order to restore Underland to 
its usual barmy self, she must defeat the Queens 
horrible monster, the Jabberwocky.
There was a conspicuous lack of the madness 
that makes Underland Wonderland, and not just 
another magical world Alice could have fallen into. 
Wonderland is full of creatures and things so illogical 
that they seem to make sense in a roundabout 
way, a land of insanity with hidden wisdom and an 
appreciation for creativity. But although the visual 
effects and character designs gave the impression of 
a mad Wonderland, the plot did not.
In Burtons Alice in Wonderland, Alice was the 
chosen one, who ancient legend predicted 
would return to Underland to Complete a quest 
and save the day. On her way, she is helped by the 
Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and other fantastic 
characters who are magical and entertaining, 
but seem to be more like magical helpers of other 
quest sagas. Because of this, Underland seems like 
just another magical world and Alice just another 
"chosen one  as oxymoronic as that sounds.
Throughout the movie, the Mad Hatter reminds 
Alice of the importance of imagining the impossible 
and appreciating madness, though he does not 
portray either of these qualities himself.
The special effects and the artistic care put into 
the Underland landscapes, as well as the costumes 
and the characters themselves, made this film 
visually inspiring and stunning to watch. Computer
generated characters such as the March Hare and 
the Jabberwocky were creatively designed, and 
human actors such as Johnny Depp as the Mad 
Hatter and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen 
looked like true citizens of Wonderland  the Queen 
was stark white with heavily darkened features, and 
the Mad Hatter was, well, mad-looking.
Burtons famed dark, almost-gothic style was evident 
in the style of the characters and Wonderland 
itself. However, though it was easy to identify his 
influence, this influence was not overpowering: 
Underand was not turned into a gothic cemetery.
Although darker details and themes did seep into 
the crazy countryside, it made the movie distinctly 
Burton-esque; but thankfully, it did not turn 
Underland into Halloween Town. Burton, however, 
did not transform it into Wonderland, either. Instead, 
it seemed to be a magical world, full of visual 
wonders and impressive characters, but without the 
madness that made it a unique world of its own.

For the third consecutive week, Alice in 
Wonderland has dominated the box office, 
grossing $34.5 million total.

On dance music
In todays culture of bombastic beats and heavy synthetic 
drones, lyrics are going by the wayside in popular music, and 
bass is speaking in ways language never could. Words now 
are chosen more for their cadence than their emotive value, 
and while I enjoy the refrain from songs like Lady Gagas Bad 
Romance, enough is enough. This dance music trend needs 
to stop.
At its best, bass-driven dance pop is a primal and visceral 
experience; at its worst, its a cheap way to entertain college 
drunks. The synthetic groan of a bitcrusher may be great in 
the heated sweat of the dance floor, but dance pop rarely 
resonates beyond the confines of the club. The experience is 
too electronic; it lacks a human element: lyrics.
Dance raves are 'great if youre European, but Americans 
listened to Bruce Springsteen long before they had heard 
of DJ Shadow. From The King to the Beatles to Bob Dylan, 
nriusics poetic lyricism has long been a force of social change 
and internal exploration, and no recent music has had more 
effect than Dylans The Times, They Are a-Changin.
Make no mistake, the world is full of talented electronic 
artists. On St. Patricks Day, 1 experienced electronic music at 
its finest with STS9 performing at Mr. Smalls Theatre. Critics 
are right: STS9 is making electronic music relevant again, 
and I was happy to see a strong Carnegie Mellon presence 
at the concert. People  artists and listeners alike  just 
need to delve into the lyrics as much as the beats. It is as 
simple as listening to Radiohead merge abstract lyrics with 
electronic dissonance. And if youre looking for something 
new, try exploring the lyrics of Matt Berninger as he sings for 
The National. No one conveys the looming potential of loss 
better than he does: We expected something, something 
better than before. We expected something more / Do you 
really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting, lock 
it up and leave / Do you really think you can just put it in a safe 
behind a painting, lock it up and leave / Walk away now and 
youre gonna start a war.

with feathered fans and 
a Rockette-style line kick 
were charming, but lacked 
a wow-factor, and couldn't 
live up to the previous year's 
musical number by Hugh 
Jackman.
Following the musical number, 
the comedic duo of Steve 
Martin and Alec Baldwin 
arrived on stage. This pairing 
was a welcome change, 
because 1986 was the last 
time that more than one 
person hosted the show. The 
two hosts took jabs at each 
other, but most of the night was 
spent picking on the famous 
faces that were 
honored.
As hosts, they 
did exactly what 
they needed to 
do: allow those 
sitting in the 
chairs for 
almost four hours 
to enjoy
themselves 
in
between 
the 1
occasionally drawn-out acceptance speeches. One 
example of their joviality involved Steve Martin 
mentioning "that damn Helen Mirren, to which Alec 
Baldwin corrected him, Dame Helen Mirren."
There were no water-cooler moments and no promised 
revolutionary instances this year. Nonetheless, the show 
garnered 41.62 million viewers, a respectable increase 
from last years 36.94 million.
For the most part, though, the show was like every 
other years, where most people tune into whats known 
as The Big Five." This quintet of awards includes 
Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. 
(Fun fact: Only three films have won all five awards, 
delightfully dubbed the Oscar Grand Slam.) Awards 
like Best Documentary Short and Best Sound Mixing 
dont hold viewers attention.
The award for Best Supporting Actor, going to Christoph 
Waltz for his role as the Jew Hunter in Inglourious 
Basterds, was not much of a shocker at all. His portrayal 
was consistently applauded.
The female category also hosted an actress expected 
to take home the prize: MoNique. Her portrayal of a 
ruthlessly abusive mother hiding a horrifying story in 
Precious was met with acclaim from countless critics, 
and so it was no surprise when she took home the 
golden statue.
The film Precious was quite popular. Marshall Fine of the 
Huffngton Post described the film as one that doesn't 
shy away from the depth to which human beings can 
sink." Not all critics fell in love with the inspiring story, 
though. A writer for the Daily Telegraph described 
Precious as a dispiriting mix of clich and melodrama.
Moving on to Best Actress, though all five nominees 
delivered stunning performances, there were two 
favorites: Meryl Streep and Sandra Bullock. Streeps 
role in Julie and Julia was nothing short of her expected 
greatness; Bullocks role, however, came among 
comedic and not-as-incredible portrayals. Thus, Bullock 
stood out more as an actress, and this, many critics 
feel, is why she ended up taking home the Oscar. Many 
also said that Meryl Streep didnt need another Oscar 
to prove shes talented; but others argued that if she is 
delivering time after time, why not reward her?
Similar to last years show, the nominees of the Best 
Actor and Actress category were announded and 
commended individually by past co-workers. This 
allowed all viewers and audience members to look at 
the potential winners as more than just great actors, but 
great people and friends as well.
Undoubtedly the biggest change of the night was in the 
most important category: Best Picture. Not since 1943
has the Best Picture category hosted 10 nominees. So 
what was the reason for the expansion? Sid Gannis, the 
president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences, stated in a press conference, Having 10 Best 
Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to 
recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that 
often show up in the other Oscar categories, but have 
been squeezed out of the race for the top prize.
Regardless of the number of nominees, there will only be 
two or three serious contenders. For example, Up was 
one of the most admired movies of the year; but just as 
everyone agreed it was terrific, everyone also agreed 
that it had almost no chance of winning the Oscar.
The public raved when Katherine Bigelow was seated 
just in front of James Cameron  not only were they the 
brains behind the two most nominated films of the night 
and the hottest contenders for dozens of awards, but 
they were once married. Is there a better way to send a 
message to an ex-husband than to take home the most 
important award in the industry? Bigelow did just this 
when The Hurt Locker took home the Oscar for Best 
Picture
And if you have contributed to the $2.64 billion gross of 
Avatar, you can most likely agree with this sentiment: 
so-so story, incredible special effects. Cameron 
postponed the movie until the necessary technology 
was available... if thats not dedication to making the 
best film possible, what is?
So the great debate came down to whether or not a  
movie that surpassed the unsurpassable Titaitic was 
worthy of a Best Picture award. Theres probably not 
a single viewer that could deny calling the visuals 
breathtaking. But is that enough? Its biggest rival was 
The Hurt Locker, which didnt gain much nationwide 
attention until awards season. Even still, it only grossed 
$25.8 million, less than 10 percent of Avatar's intake.
Immediately before the winner was revealed, The Hurt 
Lockers Katherine Bigelow was handed another Oscar 
for Best Director. This marked a monumental moment, 
as she is the first female director to ever receive the 
award. Not since 2004 with Eastwoods Million Dollar 
Baby has the Best Director also won the Best Picture.
Overall the Oscars was a night of great success and 
surprising new advancements. If youre one of the 
millions of viewers who tuned it, you truly did witness 
Hollywood history.

Collaboration meets experimentation in Broken Bells
Jason Mercer of the Shins and Danger Mouse join forces for the release of their latest project
The last album the Shins released was 2007s Wincing 
the Night Away. Since then, the band has gone 
through lineup changes and has moved labels, jumping 
to lead singer James Mercers private label, Aural 
Apothecary. While it was rumored that a new album 
might be released in 2009, nothing has surfaced yet.
With everything on pause, a side project'was bound to 
happen.
The first time Mercer and Brian Burton, better known 
as Danger Mouse, worked together was on the song 
Insane Lullaby, a track based on alternative rock 
band Sparklehorses project Dark Side of the Soul. It 
really comes as no surprise when the duo announced in 
September 2009 that they would be collaborating to form _ 
a new band called Broken Bells.
Some have compared Broken Bells to The Postal Service, 
citing similarities between Ben Gibbard and Mercer, 
as both used their side projects to experiment with 
electronic sound.
On first listen, their self-titled debut sounds fresh and
unique, with soulful harmonies and captivating beats. 
The sound is reminiscent of the Beatles, but with the 
bands own quirks. The High Road, their first single 
and the first track on the album, features skipping beats 
and synthetic punches, which are echoed throughout 
many of the other nine songs on the album.
"Vaporize, the next track, begins with a few chords on 
acoustic guitar, which is later joined by Mercers voice, 
an organ, percussion, and bass. As with the next track 
on the alburn, Your Head Is On Fire, and a later track, 
"Citizen, it pulls from Mercers other band and could 
probably pass for a song by the Shins.
From there, the middle tracks dont quite parallel the 
first two in excitement or fascination. It isnt until 
October, a song with a catchy, upbeat tempo propelled 
by an electric keyboard, that the album wakes up again. 
The album concludes with The Mall and the Misery, 
which starts with a fast drum beat, followed by technoelectronic sounds.
Perhaps the best way to describe the album is that, with
the exception of a few songs, everything merges into 
one. Its hard to notice, especially while multitasking, 
when the songs change. Although Broken Bells is 
pleasant to listen to, and definitely worth a listen, its 
nothing to write home about.
A few boundaries were pushed, as Mercer uses his 
voice in a higher register, but there seems to be no 
new growth for the duo. While the album as a whole is 
captivating, nothing in the album stands out.
Perhaps the duo didnt have enough time to experiment 
more, or maybe the project was just a distraction for 
Mercer as he moves past his losses and tries to find 
his way. It would seem that way when one peruses the 
lyrics, especially as he describes in The High Road: 
"Cause they know, and so do I/The high road is hard 
to find/A detour to your new life/Tell all of your friends 
goodbye.

Invictus is a 2009 film based on an 
initiative set forth by South African 
President Nelson Mandela, played by 
Morgan Freeman, for his countrys 
rugby team to win the 1995 Rugby 
World Cup. Both Morgan Freeman 
and Matt Damon  who co-stars as 
the South African team captain  
received Oscar nominations for their 
roles. Directed by Clint Eastwood, 
this movie does a very good job of 
capturing the strong divide between 
blacks and whites in the apartheidtorn country, and its strong, stirring 
message is a wonderful part of 
history to relive. Fun fact: Nelson 
Mandela has stated in interviews that 
the only actor he ever wanted to play 
him was Morgan Freeman.

The Linguistics Club has teamed up with 
AB Films and Late Night this week to 
bring you The Linguists. Its a fascinating 
(really, it is) documentary about language 
extinction that is both funny and 
interesting at the same time  a deadly 
combination. In the documentary, we 
follow two linguists who traverse the 
globe collecting recordings of a few 
of the over 3000 languages that are 
currently on the verge of extinction. The 
film addresses the issues of widespread 
use of dominant languages and what 
their usage implies with regard to local 
knowledge and history. The travels of 
these men to some extremely remote 
areas are truly a sight to behold.
Antichrist
Sunday, March 28
8 10 12
Antichrist is an intense horror film 
by Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier 
that deals with what can best be 
described as purely evil behavior. 
Willem Dafoe and Charlotte 
Gainesbourg star as a married couple 
whose child tragically dies at the 
beginning of the film and after which 
they retreat to a cabin in the woods 
to repair their crumbling marriage. 
Through a series of bizarre acts, 
violent sexual behavior, and some 
horrific imagery, Antichrist is one 
messed-up, but somehow thoughtful, 
piece of cinema.

Music, costume, and dance: Students gather for Greek Sing
Fraternities and sororities come together to sing and dance for St. Jude Childrens Hospital
by Meela Dudley | Pillbox Editor 1
For students and faculty members alike, Greek Sing 
is often acclaimed as the most anticipated event of 
the school year. This reputation-has been rightfully 
earned, as the members of Carnegie Mellon3 various 
fraternities and sororities often dedicate hours upon 
hours of their time to building sets, learning songs, 
and choreographing dance routines to prepare for this 
stunning show. Aside from all of the glitz and glamour of 
Carnegie Mellons very own glimpse into Broadway, and 
the pride and joy that come with winning an award for 
one's house, Greek Sing is an event with a noble purpose 
. all of the money earned through ticket sales and 
Greek-sponsored events is donated to a philanthropic 
cause chosen by the students.
This year, the Greek community decided to dedicate the ' 
record-breaking $38,000 earned to St. Jude Childrens 
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Because of 
donations like this one, St. Jude is able to provide 
free health care to children diagnosed with serious 
illnesses all across the United States. St. Jude is also 
making strides in cancer research. As the hospital's 
representative stated in his student address, "our goal 
at St. Judes is get to a point where we, the staff, are all
unemployed. We want to close our doors forever  we 
want to find a cure for cancer.
Keeping their philanthropic mission in mind, the 
members of Carnegie Mellons various fraternities and 
sororities put on an unforgettable show. The Greek 
community also chose to dedicate their performances 
to recently passed Pi Kappa Alpha brother Matt Tembo, 
holding a moment of silence at the beginning of the 
show in his honor.
The first act of the show consisted of four singles acts, 
in which four fraternities chose to perform without a 
sorority house partner. Up first was singles third-place 
recipient Pi Delta Psi with a rendition of the 2008 
musical tragicomedy film Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along 
Blog. In the skit, Dr. Horrible, an aspiring supervillian, 
struggles to one-up his archnemesis Captain Hammer 
while simultaneously trying to attain the affection of 
their mutual love interest, Penny.
Second came Beta Theta Pi with an original show that 
can best be described as a cross-dressing rendition of 
a Jersey Shore and Bachelor hybrid musical. Although 
the fraternity did not receive any awards for the 
singles division because its performance lacked a
key component  song  the men of Beta Theta Pi 
kept the audience in hysterics throughout their entire 
performance. After the Beta brothers came singles 
second-place recipient Sigma Tau Gamma with the 
houses production of The Night Man Cometh," a 
musical adaptation of an episode of the FX sitcom 
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Because the 
circumstances surrounding the performance were not 
properly explained with a script description or cited 
source, many audience members were confused as to 
what was going on with the plot. Regardless, seeing 
fraternity brothers sing about superheroes in giant baby 
and sun costumes was extremely entertaining, and the 
overall vocal quality of the performance was notably 
high.
Last but not least, singles first-place recipient Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon put on Titanic (On Ice). While many 
expected the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon to roll out 
on roller skates or something of the sort, the audience 
was surprised to find that the show was on ice" because 
instead of charting the journey of the various passengers 
aboard the Titanic, it instead told the story of the iceberg 
itself, which took on a particular likeness to Ariel of 
Disneys The Little Mermaid. The performance was full of 
witty humor, talented singers, and a beautifully detailed

Ice)." Right: Two Beta Theta Pi brothers imitate rappers in their original show.

set, which made it overall completely deserving of its 
first-place singles title.
After a brief intermission, the show continued with Act
2, the doubles performances. In these performances, 
various fraternities and sororities chose to team 
up  making for interesting vocal harmonies as well 
as larger, more intricate acts. Up first were the doubles 
third-place recipients Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha 
Epsilon Pi in their performance of Wicked, he celebrated 
retelling of The Wizard of Oz. The lead roles of Glinda 
and Elphaba were beautifully portrayed by the women 
of Alpha Chi Omega. Aside from incredible vocal talent,- 
the performance also consisted of a positively dazzling 
set that made excellent use of props and stage space. 
Alpha Epsilon Pi also received the Chairmans Choice 
Award, which is handpicked by the Greek Sing chairs 
and often understood to be the congeniality award for 
the sororities and fraternities involved in the event.
Doubles winners Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Kappa 
Alpha performed next with their rendition of British 
jukebox musical Mamma Mia! Performing popular songs 
like Dancing Queen and "Mamma Mia," the vocal 
performance of the Kappa Alpha Theta sisters and Pi 
Kappa Alpha brothers was extraordinary, appropriately 
earning them the winning trophy. I thought the Theta/ 
PiKA win was rightfully earned," said first-year biology 
major Peggy Lees. The girls did a fabulous job vocally 
and the dance numbers were really professional. I was so 
happy when they won.
Next, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon 
performed their rendition of the 1980 musical film 
Fame!, in which audiences follow the successes and 
failures of several students from New York Citys High 
School of Performing Arts. Although the show did not 
place, the set for Fame! was the most impressive of all 
of the doubles acts. Also, audiences couldnt help but 
appreciate that in Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma 
Phi Epsilons version of the musical, the character Nick 
chooses to attend the prestigious Carnegie Mellon 
University School of Drama" upon graduating from New
Courtesy of Guillermo Gomez

Delta Delta Delta and Delta Tau Delta managed to earn 
the doubles second-place prize for their performance 
of John Waters 1988 film-based musical Hairspray. 
Despite their performance being stopped abruptly due 
to what was described by an MC as a power outage, the 
groups managed to continue and put on a truly dazzling 
performance. Perhaps most notable was the likeness of 
the cross-dressing Delta Tau Delta actor playing Edna 
Turnblad to the role played by John Travolta in the 
popular 2007 film rendition of the musical. The costumes 
in this performance were especially impressive, and the 
audience couldnt help but sing along with the Delta 
Delta Delta sisters and Delta Tau Delta brothers when 
they performed songs like The Nicest Kids in Town" and 
Mama, Im a Big Girl Now.
Last but not least, the sisters of Delta Gamma 
collaborated with the brothers of Phi Kappa Theta to 
put on their version of 1990s Cry-Baby. The, musical 
is similar to Jim Jacobs and Warren Caseys Grease 
in that it tracks the relationship of a clean-cut girl and 
a bad boy. In the show, Baltimore teenager Allison 
Vernon-Williams falls in love with Wade Cry-Baby 
Walker and is drawn to his rowdy group of mischievous 
lowlifes. Possibly the best portrayal in the show came 
from Lenora, the schizophrenic bad girl who is seemingly 
and obsessively in love with Cry-Baby and willing to do 
anything to ruin his relationship with Allison. Although 
they did not place, Delta Gamma and Phi Kappa Theta 
were definitely crowd favorites  cheers from the 
audience could be heard throughout the performance.
Greek Sing is an opportunity for students to come 
together and recognize the efforts of our Greek 
community. It seems that all too often, the charitable 
efforts of the sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on 
campus are overlooked in favor of more controversial 
incidents. During performances as impressive as these, 
we are able to recognize the determination of our Greek 
students. All in all, Greek Sing was a night of great fun, 
good motives, and fabulous talent.

Designers unveil innovative lines for Fashion Week in Paris and Milan
Fashion Week for fall/winter 2010 wrapped up in 
Paris just recently. Continuing the trend from New 
York and London, many designers put out fantastic 
work in Milan and Paris. Here are some favorites 
from the show.
Milan
Milans fashion week lasted four days, which is 
a lot shorter than usual, and Anna Wintour was 
the source of the issue. For those who dont know 
Wintour, she is the editor-in-chief of American 
Vogue and commonly referred to as one of the 
most influential executives in the fashion industry. 
Wintour is easily recognized as the inspiration for 
Miranda Priestly, the cold fashion industry icon 
from the book and movie The Devil Wears Prada. 
Wintour unexpectedly announced that she would 
be shortening her stay at Milan to four days due to 
her scheduled appearance at the Oscars. Organizers 
scrambled to accommodate Wintour, squeezing over 
a hundred shows and presentations into just four 
days. However, both Fendi and Prada chose to keep 
their shows on Thursday, the fifth day, regardless 
of Wintour's absence. Critics praised these lines for 
this gutsy move, and the designers were rewarded 
for their independence when Wintour made an 
unexpected appearance at both of their shows. Silvia 
Venturini, one of the creative designers for Fendi, 
stated in an interview with wtop.com after her show 
that "you have to believe in what you are worth."
Fendi featured its trademark fur as one of the 
primary accessories for the upcoming fall season.
Karl Largerfeld, artistic director of Fendi, reinvented 
the winter 2010 line with more modern and 
futuristic characteristics. The colors of the collection 
were earthy  navy, cream, and mustard were 
featured in several garments. However, the line 
also showed some hyped feminine characteristics 
such as high-waist hems. In contrast with Fendi, 
Pradas show gave a sense of nostalgia. Rather than 
following the trend of thin and skinny, Miuccia 
Prada celebrated womens curves and unveiled new, 
voluptuous clothing. That being said, Prada seemed 
to have taken a more conservative approach to her 
line, and some thought it to be less innovative.
Versace toughened things up with leather. Biker 
chic dominated the show as the catwalk featured 
leather coats combined with wool, fur, and metallic 
leather minis and skirts. Rather than sticking to 
signature prints, Versace put out a new collage of 
leather, tweed, and other materials. Although the 
line felt industrial at times, it was certainly full of 
vibrant energy.
One of the notable accessory designers from Milan 
was Salvatore Ferragamo. Ferragamo, a well-known
Italian shoemaker, custom-made many shoes for 
Hollywood stars  including Greta Garbo  back 
in the day. Right before Milan Fashion Week, 
in collaboration with the Ferragamo company 
and relatives of Garbo, the designers put up an 
exhibition dedicated to Garbos films, photographs, 
clothing, and accessories. An avid Ferragamo fan, 
Garbo owned over a hundred pairs of his shoes. 
During Fashion Week, Ferragamo featured designs 
inspired by Garbo in the fall collection.
Paris
In comparison to Milan Fashion Week, Paris was 
not forced to face dramatic changes and ran quite 
smoothly. Notably, Stella McCartney, Celine, and 
Chloe all featured a chic-minimalist look in their 
lines. The designers showed clean-cut, modern, 
and sensual collections. A palette of beige, gray, 
black, and navy dominated their runways. Stella 
McCartney featured V-neck tunics and skinny wool 
pants, sleeveless wool coats, mini-shifts, and graphic 
uses of neutral colors. Similarly, Celine showed navy 
slim-dresses with tiepin collars, clean-cut shirts, 
and leather-lapel coats. Chloe created camel-colored 
pieces, slouchy skirts, and classic school coats. All 
of the clothes produced by these designers were 
practical and were pieces that real women would 
want to wear. Although the clothes were kept at a 
minimal, the designers accentuated their lines with 
quirky details.
Chic-minimalist contrasted greatly with the 
futuristic Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga. 
Ghesquieres line was inspired by technology. He 
used materials that were hard to identify; some 
appeared to be coated in plastic while others 
resembled packing materials. Jackets were printed 
with words in primary colors as if they could 
be posters on the side of a street. Another bold 
designer, Pierre Balmain, featured lots of gold lace 
and black suits in his line.
Fashion Week also made a notable attempt to ease 
skinny model stereotypes. Marc Jacobs decided to 
cast plus-size models for his Louis Vuitton collection. 
Bar Rafaeli, Alessandra Ambrosio, and Adriana 
Lima walked the runway wearing silhouettes that 
highlighted their womanly curves. It was nice to see 
some real women figures on the runway.
All in all, Fashion Week in Milan and Paris was full 
of drama. However, the clothing produced was, as 
always, exhilarating.
